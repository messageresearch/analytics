fresh oh God I pray Lord may it be a moment Lord in your presence Lord where God the refreshing Lord of your presence your spirit Lord has poured out o God Upon Our Lives Lord into US Lord and through us the Lord we pray granted Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen certainly to reach you in the name of the Lord Jesus as returning there in the scriptures to job 23 I want to just say we also want to remember brother Jerry and sister Mina I know that they're on the road and they're traveling home I tried my best to get him uh to be here we certainly have enjoyed ourselves and then for the three services amen that brother Jerry Was Here amen and we just so appreciate amen the gift we appreciate brother Jerry's Ministry very much amen I always look at that that you know every gift that has a life is surrendered to the Lord you know and how God comes through and uses that we're the benefactors of that we benefit and you know that's I think it's so fitting of how that God just works through a great bouquet and many different gifts and lives and it's also what's around the gift how God so makes up the man and the wisdom and the experiences and that's one thing I always pray when I when as a person stands here that you know that God would take the experiences many times I'll pray it in the office take the experiences that they've been through and let them just come forth the Lord God because we benefit from that and you say Amen we benefit from from that and we're just so so thankful to the Lord and we're just looking forward to what the Lord will do for us here uh remember Sunday evening brother Ronnie will be coming up to minister in the the youth service here on Sunday evening at five at five PM all or welcome and uh we certainly I certainly have enjoyed amen those Services very much we would just I just recently had traveled over to Brother Paul's to hear brother Danny steaman on a youth service and my goodness I was so blessed I was in I was so strengthened and encouraged and the word of God is is without age you know it just really depends on our hearts on how that we you know receive it and apply it and so we just thank God for that I also want you to remember um uh there's a few different requests but for brother Nathan Bryant his mom went home to be with the Lord uh just the the other morning and uh it was actually Monday morning and so um it was Monday morning is that right honey I think so it was at the beginning of the week so we want to remember them in prayer my days are kind of mixed up there but and it was at the beginning we want to just keep them in prayer that the Lord will just Comfort them during this time and certainly like brother Nathan had said you know she's not in any pain anymore because the pain had got so great in Her Bones from the cancer so we just thank God because she's standing in a perfect body now no pain and she's in in perfect victory over there so we just thank God for that amen let's look here in the word of the Lord tonight amen verse 8 just a few verses of scripture where we've been drawing from and we'll just read this and let you be seated verse 8. behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him how many have been there I've never been there probably maybe you know as you've been serving the lord any length of time you've come into these moments where it seems like you don't feel you don't feel God's presence you haven't heard from him you start examining your life is there anything that's out of out of out of cater but I'll say this to you just to put the devil on notice God don't hide anything from us if there's something that's out of order God makes that known to us is that right so we can just dismiss the enemy's criticism because the enemy is always there to accuse well you've done something you've done this you've done that but remember the Bible said if our heart condemns us not is that right God is greater than our heart so we can just we're able to stand there then like job though we haven't heard from him though we do not sense his presence but we know I'm standing on the word of God but he knoweth verse 10 the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food amen Amen Let me just read to you a quote if I could before you're seated if that's all right out of three kinds of Believers and I want to draw from this sometimes Believers are put to the test where the Bible says not sometimes every time for every son that cometh to God must be chastened try child trained and remember the trials the dusty roads the hot son of persecution but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material till she's ready to go into the mold God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of God living through them how many want to be a living example the trial comes to shaking to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand they tested they try every son that cometh to God I'd just like to speak on one word here tonight and begin on that and that's the simple word of faithful faithful may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I look here in this message on three kinds of Believers and those of you as you listen to this and there's messages that you know as I go through at different times as the Holy Spirit are just Inspire and I just keep going through and listening over and over and over but you know when you come through this on three kinds of Believers that brother Branham is dealing very heavily and very much so even when tests and trials we are Tried by the word of God we are there is tests that comes our way there's trials that come our way and we're we're we're tested on where we're going to stand and this is where it comes into every one of the categories that are all around remember there were many that followed Jesus at first but then when he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you can have no life in you and there were many that were offended at him and they walked away they were walking with him many as it says in the beginning of that scripture in John 6 they believed but yet that belief itself it came to an end and here we find that what ended up taking place out of all of that is they walked away but then you had Judas and Judas stayed on to almost to the very end but I want you to understand this just so you can also put the devil on notice because when Satan wants to come and tell you that you're a Judas you're able to discern his voice by knowing what's in your heart the ground that you and I stand on is the word of God it's not emotion it's not our feelings it's not any gift it is upon the word of God that's been established in our heart and Judas remember as the prophet in this message goes over and over again Judas was looking for a loophole the whole time what's a loophole a way out a reason or excuse that will justify what was always any but you see the rest of them as they stood there well you know they weren't you know maybe in the Who's Who and couldn't read their name on a boxcar but there was something about it that they they knew what was behind that veil of Flesh that was standing there it came out of Peter's heart Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and though the rest of them that when we looked at where they stood as Believers that even coming to that place where Judas went off yet the rest of them they walked on with the Lord even even when the crucifixion had happened I want you to understand this as Believers we could look back and you see when that happened it didn't happen according to their thinking and they then begin to go back to fishing and going back to those those things of occupying of life from where the word had come and called them from but just because they couldn't understand the event was that was taking place and they had walked that way did not dismantle them from being Believers but the word himself went as the faithful Shepherd and gathered the Believers by revealing his word that he had fulfilled they were not they were not going to be convinced by anything else it had to be him who is the word and he's the one that where the word is fulfilled it gathered them into that place to where that now they could be United with him in a union to where it was not just a fellowship walking down the road together but now through the sacrifice he had made a way that they could be united through and by the new birth where his own Spirit his own life could live in them and that's why he could say because I live you can live also you shall live also so I want to just take that thought on the Loyalty in looking at this in this uh uh a quote right here out of three kinds of Believers if you can back up Brianna to that place there where it says the Loyalty of your heart is what beats that material till she's ready to go into the mold now I want you to notice no there's nothing in this life that we're going to take with us outside of our character every bit of money if you have any your homes whatever all of that you say well I have children and this and that but the only thing that you and I take with us is our character that's when it comes down to everything it's our character and character itself is not something that is gifted that something that is just uh uh uh that we earn but remember the holy spirit is the gift of God that is given to you and I as we come God's provided way and through that life within us that's what molds our character that's what shapes us that's what molds our lives and then his life in us it's the Loyalty of our heart that beats the material soul in the midst of tests and trials and day to day and I I tell you we we we live by faith every single day in our life and it is living when because faith is not our feelings there's days you feel like a Christian and there's days you don't feel like a Christian there's days you feel Victorious and there's days you don't feel Victorious but faith is their constant regardless [Music] and I think that's where we can live from that because to stand with the Loyalty from our heart that actually will beat the character because the character is who we really are that's what we really are and so notice it's that that's beating that because there's a mold you see in our lives when that character is is leaves this body when that Soul there is there that theophany that's there in the heavenlies that body that Paul speaks of Peter speaks of that's reserved preserved in the heavens that garment that we're to be clothed upon and then as we enter into that those that's gone on by the way of the Grave they've already entered into their theophany and they will come back at the Rapture with their theophany and pick up a glorified body and we who are alive and remain will take our glorified body and meet our theophany so it just goes to show you that within this that we have two Realms of us that we have to battle through two Realms of us that flesh and that spirit that constantly wants to suppress and wants to keep us trapped and housed in but loyalty of our heart beats the material the character and what is character character is a victory it is a victory and we see that through the life of the Lord Jesus in order for that character of his own life to come through us it took him surrendering his will completely and laying aside and dying for you and I that you and I could be benefactors and partakers of that life when did he read then they looked at when he received power for he said afterwards he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given to me oh why you see the world and the way the world is set up it's a gang gang gang but the way of real true reality is through a life of submission that lets Christ himself reign in our lives that's where real power is gained not in all that we can do but it's what we can submit ourselves to so when we look at this word loyalty and here and I'm I'm speaking on faithful and that's where this is derived from and to be loyal or loyalty it's a quality of being loyal I'm just going to refer to a few words as we listen and there's no doubt many words that flood your mind when we think of loyal or loyalty such as Allegiance or faithfulness and adherence devotion steadfastness uh true heartedness a dedication and to be loyal means giving or showing firm and constant support or allegiance to a person or an institution it can be described also as faithful true true-hearted tried and true true blue a lot of these terms we've heard right devoted constant steadfast staunch Dependable reliable trusted trustworthy trusty dutiful unchanging unwavering unswerving dedicated committed firm stable steady and unfailing I I just say it in this way loyalty itself and and that of faithful is something that is within a life and it beca it comes out through actions and through our works remember brother Banner when he went uh he was collecting power uh bills money and he walked up to this uh when he had to collect you know for the power company he walked up to the door and he knocked on that door and here this little this little um a little little woman came to the door and brother Ram says she was dress so you know scandily and things like that he just had to you know kind of turn his head and and here she is you know she he asked her he said hey he says I you know I'm here to collect the money and she said Okay and she goes dancing across the floor because she had some tunes playing there and there was this uh announcement that came across on those tunes and said be sure that the dance is on Saturday night and so forth and and they will be there and she said and brother Ram says she blew a kiss like to that radio or to that announcement and said I'll be there and she handed brother Branham the money and brother Branham paralleled it with uh a brother named brother Brown who was a pastor at another church and that brother had talked about making pledges for people to come to church so many days and so many weeks out of the Year and that brother said well I've got you know I've got them to where they'll come about half the time or whatever more and brother Brian said you see he says what it is he says with her he says that woman he said she was going to be at that dance no matter what it took he said if she'd have had to pawn her clothes she was gonna be there why she was dedicated loyal faithful to what she loved you see whatever is first whatever is priority will always show itself and we're talking about actions we're talking about that which comes out of our life it always will declare itself and so I think if there's one thing that we want our testimony to be is we want to have a testimony that we've lived a life that is loyal to the word of the Living God at all cost no matter what it costs me I want to live true to the word of God I don't want to just in my heart say well you know I I wouldn't do anything against the Lord but I want my life to testify that's a Christian I want my life to be a witness that says there's a Believer Our Lives to be a witness to get that one could say there goes a faithful Christian that's my desire now let's look here we're just going to take a little bit of a study and just kind of start into it a little bit tonight upon this word of faithful these are some things that you know for some time that just had upon my heart and looking at this part of it in the scripture in job's life and as we look at that in job 11 job 23 11. my foot now I want you to remember this this is Job's testimony job has refuted all the accusations all the way through you know why he's not going to give Satan's word one place in his life because he knows where he's standing that's where Joe knows he's standing job is remember God said he was a perfect man it wasn't that job was a man free of mistakes it wasn't that job was a man that didn't have to confess his sin but what he was looking at is job was standing perfect because his confession was in the sacrifice and that's what God is looking at so job's testimony this is over and over his testimony and I think if we can take an example from here right now when the enemy wants to come and try to run you down don't be a dart board say God help me I don't want to be a dart board no more I don't want to sit there and listen to it and take it to it like we heard last Thursday night listen we're veiled here within these Badger skins that's no excuse but to understand when there is something's wrong and you've confessed that you are standing there in the blood of Jesus Christ your confession is in him is that right so now job's testimony it ought to be able to stand there no I am standing in his righteousness this is Job's testimony when his faithfulness this is what's being brought into question job's faithfulness it's brought into question by church members verse 11 my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips Joe knew him he's a person I've heard from him I've talked to him amen and look at this I love this I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food we can put that down it's not just talking about your favorite flavor of Cheetos it's talking about you have esteemed his word more than anything else that you could rely on [Music] you have esteemed his word Above All Things else well brother Samuel asked him his word there's times this word comes and points out wrong in my life I esteem his word above everything else I say let every man's word be a lie and let God's word be true oh my this is why brother Graham could go on to say in that message three kinds of Believers he said Al jobet said whom I shall see for myself my eyes Shall Behold Him and not another he was a believer in Trials he was a believer in persecution he was a Believer he was a genuine believer amen I tell you gold is gold is gold no matter what it's in you could put gold in the dirt it's still gold the dirt don't change it amen you put a believer in the test or trial good day by day they're still a Believer now and that don't mean that in your spirit you may not get down are you understanding me but I'm telling you there's something that is holding you and I that's greater than any resolution of our mind when we're talking about faithful we're not talking about our own strength we're talking about his strength in you and I and I'm drawing from that strength in my life so faithful is that which means to remain loyal and steadfast to be reliable true to the facts or the original that's what I want I want to be known as a reliable Christian I don't want to be known as well you can't count on him you don't know you never know I don't want to be known as that I want to be known as a faithful Christian I'm not trying to work things on my own but I realize he stood for me he stood for me he was faithful to make a way that I could live and walk in Victory he stood there faithfully and took those Crown of Thorns he Faithfully took every weapon for me he born my transgressions he bore my shape he stood there Faithfully from me the least that I can do is stand faithful to him and to his word um so let's look at how this is faithful and I want you to as we go through this in the scripture here I want you to see how much that God looks upon this and God respects faithfulness it is things that God God will look upon in our life and God values faithfulness why let's look the very first scripture First Corinthians first chapter 1 verse 9 God is faithful how many thankful for that I'm grateful you're not we're not sitting here tonight well I don't know if he's God or not and I don't know if he'll keep his word but God is faithful he still gives the Holy Ghost he still heals the sin he still delivers the captives God is faithful so this is not a man-made quality a man can be faithful to an organization faithful to a teaching but what matters is are we faithful to the word of God God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord now notice this in Deuteronomy 7 9 know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God Glory so what we're striving for it's not it's not something that is of man this is a Godly quality now remember like anything else Satan can pervert things Satan can get in there and can Satan can cause faith on this look listen you've got people that will absolutely sacrifice their family do everything else to go to a ball game over there in Cleveland they'll sacrifice finances because you know it ain't cheap they'll go over there they'll sacrifice everything they will go there even in the cold some of them will sit there get so intoxicated with things and they will sit there with paint on you know why they are loyal you know being Cleveland fans they got to be loyal with all the loosen that takes place there's a lot of loyalty notice through thick and thin are you hearing me now it's loyalty you take it that look there are people listen friends there are people that will not give their family the time of day but they're loyal to a boss they're loyal to their job they're faithful to their job but they will not be thankful to their family well I don't run around on my wife I don't run around on my husband I don't do this but are you Faithful the Bible said he that does not provide for his household is worse than an Infidel your household needs more than just shelter food and clothing they need your emotional support they need your time they need your investment because let me tell you something the world is investing in your children everything all of these things of YouTube and everything else they are investing to try to strip down I say God it's time for us to step it up we cannot be complacent we have got to be faithful this is what I want to be faithful notice know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth now watch this which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations and repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slacked to them that hateth him he will repay him to his face now you know it might seem all but a person could actually carry the Bible and actually hate God but it's true this age we are living in that age where they have put Christ out of the church it's just like I told I told as a pastor some years ago you know when he spoke to me and he was you know making his departure from the message I told him I said the rest of these guys that you claimed to say that they believed their Bible I said they're Liars they don't believe their Bible because how can you believe the Bible and deny the Living God who has inspired all the prophets down through the word you cannot believe your Bible and deny the Living God the Pharisees and Sadducees they have the law the writings the prophets all of those things but they called him the Living Word and he said Moses wrote Of Me search the scriptures they testify of me foreign but they denied him but God is faithful nonetheless so I you know what I like that part he keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him I love him I don't say but I'm perfect but I love him my heart's desire is to please him that's why when he corrects me my heart's desire to say forgive me Lord I'm wrong when he shows me something I need to be doing and I'm not help me Lord forgive me Lord why what is it because of Desire within my heart is to please him that's what desire in your heart is it not as a Believer that's our desire that's what the coming of the Holy Ghost does is to bring that reality forth in our lives now notice Thou shalt now notice this upon us as Believers Thou shalt therefore keep the Commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I command thee this day to do them so just as much as God is faithful God requires faithfulness from you and I is that right imagine that that we that there was nobody faithful here in this assembly imagine if myself I wasn't even faithful now maybe I could come and stand here and preach all the time but yet really not be faithful one would imagine that maybe I'm not here you know once in a while I'd say you know what let's just you know what everybody just stay home tonight it is such a beautiful night outside you know I think I'm gonna do we're just gonna stream from my patio because it's beautiful outside tonight I think I might have a nice fire in the background y'all just stay home on your computer stream and we're going to do it that way you would look at me and say that's not according to the word of God eventually you should you'd be hunting yourself another pastor right because why faithfulness is what God requires but it's not faithfulness listen to me now not faithfulness out of a slave like mentality but it is faithfulness according to his word how do I be faithful to God be faithful to all that he has revealed to you all that he's revealed to you if you'll be faithful to that you watch God work in your life and reveal more oh my now look look at Moses life here for a moment numbers 12 and verse 6. now remember this is when the controversy or questioning arose because because Moses had married an Ethiopian and now here's Miriam and and Aaron remember they had brought up and you know spoken Wellness Moses the only one the word the Lord speaks to because they could not understand what Moses had done they were questioning God's servant now watch this he said this is what God Said concerning them here now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all my house oh my look at this him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold wherefore then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses I'll tell you if there's one thing we can be called that's the highest calling and that is his servant I want to be his servant you know I want to be I want God this is what a high thing for God to say God calls him out and says Moses who is my faithful servant in all mine house now what is what is God looking at here think of it as Paul will go into this I want to go into it but let me just read it out of Hebrews 3 Paul picks this up in Hebrews 3 verse 1 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Holy Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of your profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him did he not have to wrestle it out hello did he not have to wrestle it out all the way up to the end remember what took place at the end he could say for this purpose I've come for this purpose see our purpose is not fulfilled and then God just allows us to linger on and on and on and on but once the purpose has been fulfilled then our life we go same thing with the purpose the purpose of God's word in our lives for those that are alive those of us alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is that right the purpose of God is to be achieved and fulfilled no he was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house now watch how this faithfulness in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses inasmuch as he who hath building the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after so when Moses think of it when here was Moses when here he is caught up into that cloud in there there and God begins to show him there of that which is there within the heaven and he begins to unfold to him the mystery of his Dwelling Place Moses comes back down from there and we know that there is you know the sin that entered the camp and you know he had to go back up and receive from God in the mercy of God to come back down and deal with the people but to think of it there were so many details that was there in that house there was details where God think of it to where that Supernatural in Moses was caught up to seed all of the parts see all of the courts and and see all of that within the heavens and he every little detail and God gave him all of this by Revelation and here he is to come back down to earth and begin to speak that Vision now to think about it here as Moses is staying true to that Vision there's some names that were mentioned in that Vision whom God said I have spilled filled them with the spirit of wisdom Moses would begin to speak in regards to the patterns the little every little thing that went into the Tabernacle you know all of that really spoke of not just of Christ but it speaks of Christ in you and I because we are his dwelling place we are the Tabernacle of the Lord right as individual Tabernacles and collectively has stones that have been hewn out by the spirit of God to come together as part of the entire body now think of it here Moses stood faithful I wonder how many times that you know like you and I we can start on a project and we get to look here and say you know what I'll cut a little corner right here I think I got enough paint to finish this I don't need to run over Sherwin-Williams I think I'll just do in this corner right here it'll kind of bleed through from whatever the past color was but I'll just put a plant in front of right there it'll be all right nothing will show now look it would have been that easy for Moses to do that but how was Moses faithful what's Moses faithful in that he never made a mistake was Moses faithful in his own flesh no but his faithfulness was started and looked upon by God because even when he didn't understand things yet he stood with the pattern of the word that had been revealed and that's how God looks on faithfulness to you and I will we stand on God's word it isn't about how many people we pray for and how many people god well it's not about how many sermons we preach how many songs we've sung it ain't about that it's about how faithful are we with the word that God has revealed to us that's what God requires and that's what God looks at so Moses was faithful God said make it this many cubits that's how many cubits we're going to make it God said put the white Abyss around it that's what we're going to do God said to fasten it there not with nails and things and screws but God said to make it this way God said to get Badger skins to cover it this is what we're going to do what was Moses faithful to do all that God had told him to do you want to know how God looks at faithfulness right here this is how God looks at faithfulness well I don't do as much as somebody else or somebody else but if you're faithful in the eyes of God and all that God has revealed to you God looks upon you as a faithful son and daughter of God are you hearing me because to whom much has been given much is required but Christ notice as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end oh Lord Jesus help us now I want you to understand this here as we look at it we've been I've been talking about some weeks about the faith of the faithful we are not in our own selves faithful by our own accord person can be very faithful to tenants and Creeds and scriptures and a lot of different things but remember when it comes down to it it faithfulness itself is from our heart not only all that God would speak to me but all that God continues to reveal and to be faithful to that word how are we faithful to it how many ever thought things that you realized you thought wrong maybe it's just me you believe things that you realize after a while ah you know what I wasn't just exactly ironed out right there maybe it's just me and a few other people in here but you see faithfulness has nothing to do with oh he well I thought this wrong or I thought that wrong faithfulness is what do you do when you're confronted with the truth that's what real faithfulness is not making an excuse well you know brother so and so I heard him preaching no no it's about us and God in a personal walk what we do when truth comes our way oh my we are made faithful by a living experience of a living god notice how Paul would bring this out in our lives First Corinthians 7 25. Paul is writing here he says now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord yet I give my judgment this is a statement I want you to see as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful so to be faithful you've obtained Mercy from God faithful that even when you don't feel like it but to say you know what to your old flesh I don't care what you think we're going to the house of God and I don't care what you feel spirit I'm going to borrow the needs of this body and I'm gonna get down and I'm going to borrow the mouth and I'm going to pray I don't care what my flesh says my spirit says I don't care about all the accusations of the devil well brother Samuel I don't feel sense when does a Christian live on feelings if you live on feelings you'll be as up and down as a heart monitor is when it's beating you cannot live on your feelings faithfulness is when you don't feel like it but you stand there anyhow and say I don't feel it but I know that God is faithful he made you and me he he he's the one who makes faithful Witnesses who makes faithful Witnesses the faithful and true witness himself because you see when his life comes into us that life that comes into us the holy ghost that is God's faith but Iran will take us through the message the serpent send the super sense and bring to us and spoke speak to us of how that the Holy Spirit itself is the faith of God coming into our life that Faith Of God you say well I thought I have faith you do have faith but that's why we need our faith to be operated on or as brother random put it in another place to allow him to come in to our Door of Faith and take our faith Beyond just our senses we need that faith of God that's the Holy Spirit that's what we live by I say Lord I need more of it I need more out there notice this in first Timothy chapter 1 verse 12 and I think Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me notice who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who counted him faithful right he didn't get no votes from the apostles he didn't get no votes from nobody else as a matter of fact they said you don't want to go down to this guy you don't want to go down we have heard what types of things he's done right but what they didn't know is that he's met God and though he could say that you know think about what they're thinking in their mind he's just trying to draw us out he just is just a trap think about all of the things where the enemy was trying to move upon their minds to keep and keep that from being unified right there and to keep them from hearing this testimony but notice it was God who Vindicated the testimony that he had given Paul in his own life he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry look who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious any of us have chosen anybody like this I'm sure not women that chose that's just why even sometimes that you may not witness to somebody because you just don't think oh they're so vile oh they're so down I'm glad he don't think that way I don't want to be faithful to my feelings I want to be faithful to his leading glory be to God but I oh my obtain Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief this is I love this this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long suffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him till life Everlasting you realize Paul's standing there and God vindicating that word I wonder how many sitting there in a meeting that the devil had told them there's no hope for you there's no way you can ever be saved you'll never be a part of it but Paul said God permitted all of those things and yet through his grace I have obtained mercy and his grace is proving sufficient not only through my life but also to reach to others to say if God can do it for him God can do it for me yeah that's a faithful saying I say it's a faithful saying that God saved me is that a faithful saying a faithful saying that didn't stop it didn't stop 2000 years ago it's a faithful saying that God still saves life God still changes Hearts God still fills with the Holy Ghost it's a faithful saying how is it faithful because the faithful God spoke it and the faithful God confirms it and vindicates it once again right here tonight it's a faithful saying oh my think of this Colossians chapter 4 verse 9. with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you onesimus had ran from Colossians his master was filetman one of the books in the Bible one chapter long that Paul would take and write a letter and put it into onision's hands and says return this back to your master on Nissan Miss was running with a mess where his name was in it who had robbed from his master he had ran from the situation tried to get away from it put it behind him but right there notice how God has a way of directing our pathway just right where we need to be let me tell you something or Nissim his thought that he was running away now I don't know what he might have fallen up on a hard time maybe there was something that came up in the family I don't know that even history when I've studied through all of these things it never goes in to say that but whatever it was it had to be something that he thought to be a need the scriptures do not imply that this guy was a Wall Street embezzler it simply stated that here he is this has come up and he's trying to get away from it but notice God has Paul right there in Rome and here onesimus comes right into contact with Paul and Paul begins to speak to him remember what Paul said Paul said he's coming back to you and he's going to be more profitable to you now than he's ever been because he's not just coming through you back as a servant he's coming as a brother amen you want to know about the changing power of almighty God to where a man who was a robber and a thief that had run away from a situation but now in the presence of almighty God the revealed word had revealed the Son of God and now the word can stand there and say onesimus a faithful and beloved brother I tell you there's nothing that can change our past like the word of God you can try to as many racers you want there's nothing that can take it away outside of the blood of Jesus Christ you can try to I'm trying to get away from this trying to get away from that you can never do that but it's simply to recognize you're wrong and accept what Jesus Christ has done for you he'll change whatever title goes along your name and make it to say a faithful beloved brother a faithful beloved sister what does that the power of the blood of Jesus Christ brother Samuel simply believing simply believing Revelations 21 5. and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new aren't you glad he does that aren't you glad he does that in you and me and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful now you realize these words to be true and faithful this is not just reciting words David would write in Psalms 119 thy judgments are faithful O Lord thy testimonies are true and faithful they are filled with righteousness how could David say that he's not saying it because he hasn't experienced it he's saying it because he's experienced it and how can you and I say that God is faithful because we've experienced a faithful God we've experienced a God that has come down to work and change us change the very desire change our very nature we can stand right here in this scripture this is a faithful and true saying because not only has he changed my desires but he's changing me he's changing me he's changing me this is a faithful I just would rather be dead to myself I'd rather suffer with him my My Flesh I I does not request suffering I don't like suffering anybody else like suffering to be honest you don't because suffering we never get to choose how it comes and let me just tell you something suffering never is without any value it might seem like it in the natural where's the value at but remember the Loyalty of our heart is what's beating the material until it goes in the mold God knows just how to get you and I into position he knows how to mold us how to shape us and there's nothing that can do that outside of tests and trials character is not molded any other way than by tests and trials so I think we could say like brother random could say Lord don't keep them from me but give me your grace to go through Lord Give Me Your Grace give me Grace not to complain give me Grace not to belly ache when it's going on give me Grace that if I start to complain give me Grace to recognize God has kept me thus far God has given me strength in my life God has brought me step by step by the way give me Grace Lord when I'm going through tests and trials how can we ask that because he's a faithful God can't see he abided faithful so it don't matter it really don't matter if the whole world disbelieves there's going to be somebody belief I'm just going to stand I'm one are you I'm one and God in other words God's not saying well if you don't believe me I guess I have to compromise because I want you to be in attendance so much I'll compromise on my word I'll cut it here cut it there if I got to make a special program for you so that you'll come nope God said this is my word if you want true Grace if you want Liberty if you want Deliverance if you want freedom if you want all of that there is a way that I have made for you but it's your choice and God in my faithful how does he abide faithful to make it real to hearts that simply say Lord I need you Lord God I need Deliverance in my life I need healing in my body I need transformation I need to be changed Lord my character molding more and more and more I need that and he abides faithful for you and I first Peter 4 19 trying to come down here wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their soul to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator I could probably preach on the Month of Sundays on that suffering according to the will of God because I'm sure that probably all of us at one time or another have said that we are suffering according to the will of God and the will of God had nothing to do with it whatsoever it was our own decision I said all of us and I'm not even going to try to take a track record on myself or anybody else because there ain't enough index cards to keep tally marks on it for any of us in here but the one thing I'm grateful for is God's grace that moves down that through the midst of it even in our wrong decisions we can receive Grace all things work together for the good to them who are the called according to his purpose I'm thankful for God's grace he is faithful not to leave you and I I wonder how many times God could have looked down at your life or my life and said you made a mess of things you get out of that mess on your own he's faithful he's faithful now he ain't gonna pull me out of hole if I don't want to be pulled out of the hole but God said if you're ready to come out of that hole if you're ready to turn your heart back to me if you're ready I will pick you up out of there I will give you Grace where you can't climb out of there I am faithful to bring you back [Applause] that's God's sufficient Grace let me tell you there ain't nobody in the building tonight as faithful as God is [Applause] nobody but I believe we've got his life that'll bring us into that character aren't you I mean it'd be like looking at somebody that was you know just some tree imagine you went to buy a tree and on that tag on that tree they showed you a tree that was a little bitty old short little thing shriveled up had ugly leaves on and everything else and you're buying this tree why would you want to buy that tree you don't want that tree in your front yard that's why the character of Jesus Christ is on display that's what the opening of the seals did it brought the Living God right Among Us the character of Jesus Christ you might say brother Samuel that's too high for me it might be for you and me but it's not too high for the Holy Ghost inside of you and I that's what God wants us to recognize it's not you making yourself it's god making you and God is faithful when you gave up he didn't give up when you've thrown in the towel he out and thrown in the towel God is faithful [Applause] there hath no temptation First Corinthians 10 13 there had no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to bear it so we can look up to the Lord and say father your faithful Lord lead me through this Lord lead me through this God may help me to have the right kind of an attitude help me Lord to conduct myself as a son and daughter of God that's one that represents you where the rest can say do you feed him any different do you let him sleep in a different bunk house maybe you got him a Tempur-Pedic mattress nope it ain't none of that what it is he recognizes his father is a king in a distant land and he is the King's son or King's Daughter and that effect of that reality is what is influencing his faithfulness oh God let us be under that influence can I have just a few more minutes first Thessalonians 5 23 and the Very God of Peace all of that sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it not might do it not maybe do it we'll do it Faithful is he you see what the issue is don't look at yourself in the mirror because looking at yourself in the mirror be the same thing for me looking at myself in the mirror just like Paul when Paul could say he hath counted me faithful I'm sure that Paul could not have even given God a list of reasons why he should have been an apostle there's not a list of reasons that you and I have for being a Believer there's nothing that we can point and point sales be counted you and I faithful do you realize he's revealed this message to you and I not that we deserve it but he has counted counted you Faithful brother Samuel I've had my shortcomings but he's looking deeper he when he said job is a perfect man he wasn't talking about his flesh he's talking about that Son of God on the inside [Applause] second Thessalonians 3 3 but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you continue to strengthen you and keep you from evil let me read you another before I close because I think it's very fitting how the spirit of the Lord would have me to place this here right after this scripture first John 1 8 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is what faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US but if we confess our sins this time you don't know how many times I've confessed it ain't about how many times you confessed but it's time when you wouldn't distract your heart because why out of your heart is to be faithful to him to his voice let me tell you they're sufficient Grace for God to give you delivering power over every besetting sin over every way do not let the weight or besetting sin Define you as though it's going to be something you carry around all this time you need to stand upon God's word and say I will not carry this around I will not carry it I will not be subservient I speak it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what he is faithful oh brother Sammy once again if you go to looking at yourself in the mirror all you'll see is unworthiness and you know what I agree with you we're all unworthy but you're looking at the wrong one the scripture says looking unto Jesus the author and the finish of our faith I don't understand everything well do you understand his blood has come to cleanse you do you understand that he wants to change you do you understand that he wants to deliver you do you understand that he wants he the faithful one wants to produce a faithfulness in your life eight Hallelujah that's what he wants to do I think the greatest thing we can do is like what Sarah did in Hebrews 11 11 I'm closing here we just can't go no further through faith also Sarah herself received strength how did she receive strength through faith well it's faith believing what he said Sarah didn't go to some walk-in clinic and crawl into some bed like a tanning bed and pull it down and she became well I found this place a fountain of Eternal Youth and I've got to get back fair and Nick it can make me to where my husband's attracted to me again I didn't know them no she didn't have to do that remember Sarah got in the way all along right she gave Hagar all these things but eventually I noticed this it interrupted God's program but couldn't defeat it are you hearing me in interrupted but couldn't defeat it there can be a lot of interruptions in your life but your interruptions are not who you are interruptions do not define you Nord is the word defeated through Sarah through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child she was past age in other words they wrote her off past age unable not Abel failed multiple attempts but she was able because she judged him faithful who had promised that's Victory right there is to be able when we can come into that place to judge him Faithfully no matter what no matter what the circumstance no matter what the promise is but for us to stand there and judge him Faithfully no matter where you're at in your journey in your life and in your walk with God but to be able to stand there and judge him faithful do you realize Abraham came to Mount Moriah and he'd come to such a place his faith let me tell you something that Faith was in him the whole time but it wasn't to that place of maturity are you with me it wasn't to that place of maturity yet but he came to that place and he told him you stay here I am the lat are going to go in worship see it came to a place of faithfulness to the very last moment his hand was in the air Isaac laid there on the altar and the angel of the Lord said stay your hand stay your hand Abraham and God had provided for himself [Music] an offering oh my much we could go in and say that I don't want to go all there tonight but to say it to come to this place of faithful to the very last point let me tell you friends you can never ever be wrong by being faithful to the word of God I'd say tonight it ought to be the greatest thing to be able to say the desire of our heart Lord I want to be faithful to your word beyond my feelings Beyond everything I want to be faithful in order to the word of God that's the kind of testimony that I want of what that God said about Moses notice God never said Moses is my faithful servant because he stood and spoke to the Red Sea anyone's mentioned but it says he was faithful in all my house what was the house every little detail every detail was important I said God help me help me to look at that word to look at the pattern help me Lord to look at that everything is valued not things to be in this age it's an age of things getting rid of this and getting rid of this and all they want to talk about is one little thing and one attribute of God but it's such the value to be able from our hearts to say Lord I want to serve you with everything within Me Lord I want to serve you better we should say it that way man I want to serve you better Lord help me in every little detail if there's if there's a corner that I'm missing help me Lord if there's something in the pattern that I'm not saying let me just say something you'll never know what the pattern is by looking at other things but you got to get into it give yourself to the Lord give yourself to the Lord what's God continue to unfold his word because remember as you're faithful to the word of God faithful to what God has spoke to your heart God will open more to you and let's pray Lord Jesus oh God throughout Lord hear tonight Lord as we stand here Lord it's things O Lord that fathers we look at this with faithfulness Lord to be faithful and knowing that God in the midst of the test or the trial that's where the loyalty loyalty of our heart beats the material until it's time to go in the mold father it's only by your grace like we read of Paul obtained Mercy to be faithful Lord God it's not by any of our merits but Lord It's You the faithful one who makes faithful ones It's You Lord God father moving in our lives Lord not that every time that Lord that we hit the mark but you are faithful to correct us when we're wrong that even builds our confidence when we're in need of healing in our body because we know that you're faithful not only when we're right but you're faithful to tell us when we're wrong you're faithful Lord God to pour out your blessings and your faithful to bring correction to us you're faithful Lord father that's as we can stand upon your word because of your grace because of your faith moving into our lives Lord God now Lord you know where each of us are tonight you know where every heart is at I pray that God right here right here this evening for everyone that's gathered in here Lord no matter where that they're at may they take Lord God the promise and father no matter what it might be but put the past behind the Lord take Lord the forgiveness notice Lord to where that it strikes it deals with the heart and then Lord that repentance Lord would come out Lord but may we lord I pray father right here tonight every one of us Lord Lord Lord any Lord that would feel like in any way that they've fallen short may they not Lord lay there Lord in that but may they
