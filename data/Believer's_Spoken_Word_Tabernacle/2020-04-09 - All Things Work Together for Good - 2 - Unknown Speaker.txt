Bellamy found out that he could agree show me [Music] man how we thank the Lord for His mercy tonight hey man so grateful for the grace of God and I'm just so glad that we could be gathered together here once again and I just want to say we just appreciate the times that we can get together we certainly missing seeing each and every one of you just through the times that were able to have contact and just I think oh how my heart longs for a time where we be able to come back together and just to be able to see one another and so we know that that longing in her heart the desire we know that not just in this life but we also know that we're heading home and we'll come to a place there on the other side we will never have to and we'll never have to part again these the times that we come together and we gather Paul would identify at these times that we come together he would say forsake not to assemble yourselves together Paul would go on to write that our gathering that we take do now he said it's a gathering as unto Him it's it's showing there's a call within our hearts to come together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith and it is it's one of the things that we are so it's a great it's a great privilege and a great honor and I think God that we as I've said before that we have this opportunity appreciate all those who make it possible and so that we're able to do that and I would trust that each and every one of you are just drawn closer to the Lord and then throughout the time that God just watching over each and every one of you and we are just we're confident in that in those things right there we want to just look here in the word I I don't want to tarry too long here in preliminary but we do want to say we love and miss H each and every one of you and we want to go straight to the word of the Lord tonight and I would like to go back into Romans chapter eight and just look to the Lord tonight just to come and just to speak to our hearts in a real special way tonight just want to read some verses of Scripture here verse 26 and we were reading from these parts the last time we were together on a Thursday and it says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us in verse 36 or 35 it says who shall separate us from the love of Christ I want you to notice the wording it did not say what shall separate us who he goes to who is behind it who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter but nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen may God bless his word amen and let's just look to him now Heavenly Father as we Lord have gathered Lord around the Word of God Lord we are just Lord anticipating I'm looking Oh God that you would just take control and just speak to our hearts Lord speak to every life oh god that's gathered here Lord around the word and Lord you even know those that would Lord archived it in days or times to come Lord may it be an encouragement or God Oh father to every son and daughter of God may it be Lord a wooing of the Holy Spirit of God that would draw Lord any life that's been on the fence Lord may it just drawn Oh God into a place Lord where the love of God is just so overwhelms their life and they would surrender Lord so completely to you Oh God we're just asking Lord tonight that you would come and break the bread of life to us Lord speak to our hearts Lord we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then may God bless you as you being seated we want to look at that thought of all things work together to them who love God amen and to them who are called according to his purpose and we recognize that it's not just to to love God or a person can have a lot of an object and imagination they can have a thought of God but this is not talking about your thought or my thought or any man's thought of God but it's dealing with where the love of God has really come in to the innermost part of our life where his life is in full control in our lives and it's not just loving attributes about him many love his attribute of grace but his attribute of grace we know it's not something that would allow to remain or to live a sinful life you see it's never God's objective to leave us where he finds us but he comes to bring deliverance to our lives and everything and how that the Holy Spirit how he would move is by love he comes to woo us and draw us unto himself and that's the whole relationship that's what a real relationship with God is based upon it's based upon an individual falling in love with the Lord Jesus just allowing just him to keep on as he's dealing with your life you keep on yielding and and keep on just falling in love with him and seeking after him and so when we come into this the times that we we are in right now we know that as we're looking in the scripture that certainly and that not everything that takes place is good but all things work together for the good to them that love God and are called according to his purpose and so when I I look at this whole templates of Scripture here we look at things that how Paul has directed us as believers because we need solid ground there must be solid ground in a life to stand on if if in any time in a life when God permits testings and trials and God permits trouble to come our way he he comes to reveal not that he needs to know but it's us discovering the hold and the stability the anchor the assurance within our life but it's important that we in our lives that it be founded upon the solid rock like Paul we would hear him write in Ephesians 6 having done all to stand you must know where you are standing you must know the ground that you're standing on and so this is where when Paul would write in verse 31 what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us let me just say it God did not start being for us when we all of a sudden had a desire to begin to yield for him no God was already for us from before the foundation of the world he is for his word coming to pass in our life as we were looking at it last Thursday so with God to think of it of all of the hindrances and the roadblocks and annoying that even how a person can so get their lives so twisted up by making decisions and running in the world and doing all sorts of things but yet if there is and they are a seed of God and they belong to God they cannot escape the plan of God because we recognize that the Holy Spirit no matter how much and remember the enemy's objective with all of those things is to try to bring a life into a place to where they would even question and say how could God want anything to do with me what could God why would God want anything to do with me and they're looking at the spots and the stain of sin upon their life even from the nature within their life and they would ask the question how could God want anything to do with me but the scripture said if God be for us who can be against us God was for Jacob but he did not allow Jacob to bypass that of the new birth but God allowed all of those things to happen and it came back to a place to where Jacob had met God first at Bethel he was not contained he was not converted he had not been delivered of Jacob but he had a supernatural experience with God and he made a promise he says Lord when I return he said I will give thee a tithes of all and remember God was not so much looking as a tithe from all of his sheep his herds everything else although that tithe was to go to honor the Lord but God was calling for a of his life which was his soul to be turned over completely to the Lord so to recognize that within it no matter what would try to come even in that of Jacobs way and others God Himself is moving all things and he'll bring things like he has in our life to a showdown what's he doing he's declaring that he is for us it doesn't mean that and surely that within any life that they could bypass you cannot bypass the new birth you must be born again but God working upon that life then Paul would bring that would bring that reality and say he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things it was the innocent all the way from Eden all the way through it's the innocent dying for the guilty to think of even in Redemption when you read the Old Testament you go through from Genesis you're reading you move from Genesis you move you know they're in the Exodus you move two numbers you move to Deuteronomy over and over you read even as you read through a numbers even times and Exodus and Deuteronomy sometimes you read and it's like these are the same chapters that were said within the previous book but yet within at all you read that of redemption to where God had placed it in there to where you know brother Branham would take the example he said like you take he remember that which was the firstborn of any of those of the creatures as they were firstborn there had to be a lamb that would be offered in the place of that firstborn and brother Branham would take that dramas dramatization of he said if you had that of you know of that of one of them a little mule and he said that mule he said it was the ugliest looking thing in the world and he said that little mule he said you know it would have something it was such a horrible looking creature he said but if its mother was instructed in the laws of redemption it would be look to tell that little one he would say you don't have to worry because you are under a birthright and then what is required is a lamb the owner is gonna take a lamb for your life and then what she would instruct him in is that the owner that they will never see you they will see the lamb and this is where the scriptures are declaring for you and I it's not God evaluating our life to see whether or not we're worthy no man no woman is worthy of the grace of Almighty God you can't do anything to make yourself worthy it is unmerited grace amen and not that the lamb is going to be but our lamb has already been offered up it was before the foundation of the world the lamb was land this is where that the sons of God shouted for joy amen to see the salvation the security of God's plan of redemption and to recognize we were always unworthy we are not worthy other we can't merit it it is the unmerited grace of Almighty God as a matter of fact brother Branham would say God doesn't look at your unworthiness there can be a woman that might be soft towel or a man that could be so pal that seems like so much entrenched on their life but yet within it all the scriptures remain true God is not looking at their filthiness he's looking at the lamb and if God calls you to a life of justification sanctification and he's calling you to a complete deliverance he's not looking at you he's looking at the lamb because it is the lamb that has already overcome if he's looking at me its defeat he's got folk to find but I'm not called by my merits i'm told by the blood of the lamb he examines the lamb so he follows that up who shall lay anything to the charge that means bringing accusations of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God he's seated in power he did what was called of him as a kinsman he fulfilled he fulfilled his part he's already paid the price the blood was shed it was accepted he rose on that Easter morning and he set back the Holy Ghost he ascended to the right hand of God on high he is there until he maketh his enemies his footstool amen he's already seated in power you say brother Samuel what does that mean it means he has already it's a finished work he sat down on the right hand of God the word is in power the world of redemption is in power the world of Liberty is in power the world is in power what was taken out of the hands of man now that word was delivered and notice here the word the book of redemption was veiled in the man Christ Jesus he already prevailed he already overcome and the reality of this working is released to you and I as sons and daughters of God he is interceding for you and I glory be to God in the highest Amen we don't have nothing to do we have to believe think of the setting even when we were at last night think of the setting here we were in where it's observed as the Passover families were in their houses gathered together plague was on the outside blood was applied here we were in the myth here we are in the midst of it gathered with families plague on the outside blood upon the door is that right and to recognize that when that blood remember the blood God made a preparation before judgment could ever strike Egypt the message come to open the way of deliverance because you see her lord have mercy I feel like preaching you recognize that within Egypt God didn't want them walking out with taskmasters hanging over them God wanted that to be a walking out to where Pharaoh and them would say get out of here get out of here we don't want you around here anymore and that's how the Spirit of God it deals with a lot it works with a lot to do what release that son and daughter of God on the inside Oh glory be to God let me tell you something when that lamb oh they took the lamb they killed the lamb and they took the blood of the lamb they put it upon the doorposts and the lintel thereof and they had to come under that blood that blood was a representation that death has already come to this house the firstborn that should die there's already been a lamb a firstborn that has died for that first point one is already shepherd and a life has been given when the Death Angel would look upon that blood he had to recognize that heat there's already a death you cannot touch that let me tell you Satan cannot come over the Satan cannot walk over the blood and to fake of it every promise that God has made to us this is why you don't have to wonder when you get safely beneath the blood hallelujah even when God is calling alive you must believe that God is and easy rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen to come under her and anywhere his brother Brandon would tell us he said if they were to come under the head he said and they wondered I I wonder if Jehovah is going to keep his word he said that's any insult to Jehovah because every word God keeps every word Amen winner believer or my lack Romans 8:1 said there is Vallon there know for no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit their life has been completely transformed not just cleaned up but Christ has been made alive the the illumination of the heart is to please the Lord I do only those things that please him Oh glory be to God and you know you might ask in your mind or your heart you might say what does this have to do with tests and trials or even a present situation it has everything to do with it you've got to make sure you're on solid ground you've got to know the ground you're standing on what I'm preaching about is what Paul would tell them in first Thessalonians no your election brethren you've got to know where you're standing and if you've been standing on between two opinions I say in the name of Jesus Christ separate yourself from that unbelief you've got a purity to walk away from unbelief and to be and to be united with Jesus Christ get on solid ground oh my let me just say it like this you need there is solid ground is when you know you pass from death unto life to where the desire within your life is no longer just a desire to want to serve God and you know let me just say it like this for a moment you know God calls upon a life they might have they have a desire to serve John and maybe they're you know smoking drinking of fornicating whatever it is in their life and God calls upon their life and here they surrender their life to God and they still got all those habits about their life you see God is not looking at all of them habits he's calling that life into a complaint of complete surrender let me tell you something everything that that individual has need of he has already provided for that life he has not only provided the justification for us to believe he's also provided the sanctifying power of His grace to be able to break that hold of habits and things in that life he has also provided that of the Living reality of Jesus Christ that's able to reach down and move to such a place of complete transformation to where he sets down on the very throne of that heart it's not looking back we're not looking back to Calvary as a historical event we're not looking back and saying mile thank God for Calvary but we look at a like a historical event that'll do you no good you've got to know what what Calvary did that what it did and his resurrection is to reveal himself pressingly to you that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did in that body he comes and does in your body this is why over and over many things but we hear of think oh I want you to think of these these moments David would ride over and over in different places he's my rock we've preached on that even some Thursday's ago he is my rock Psalm 62 he or he alone is my rock he's the solid ground when David talked about being overwhelmed he said leave me to the rock that's higher than i is that right in psalms 27 the chapter there that would refer to that of the the the setting and everything that's going on around us in this world remember what he said he will hide me in the his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle in a will set me upon a rock God's desire is that you and I would know where we are standing that's not just for this moment but that you yourself might be a serpent bruiser and to recognize who you are in Jesus Christ you must know who you are man cannot tell us that it takes a direct revelation from Almighty God and brother he doesn't work on the inside it's a sure work of the sealing power of the Holy Ghost that you know you pass from death unto life the things you once loved you no longer love you know your desire is Jesus Christ you know that's been illuminated this word the prescient word has been revealed to you I'm saying that's Liberty that's Liberty this is why God would write all the way through in the scriptures of the Liberty that belongs to us is the sons and daughters of God he would he would announce even in the time of Israel where there would come a times of captivity where you know people would either the selling or the endowment of their land and themselves they would have to work off a debt or a lien that was against him but when the fiftieth year came there was a sound of Jubilee let me tell you something that trumpet when it sounded that man had a choice he could either believe the announcement and go free he didn't have to go ask the master can I be free he didn't have to go after one and say hey can I go can I go back to me he didn't have to the sounding of the trumpet remember all Israel could not see the atonement and the blood being shed but the but the blood was connected with the sound and there was a priest that would ride throughout the land and that priest would announce that the blood had been shed the atonement had been made and you can go free they could take whatever it was that they were bound with and release it and walked under the authority of the Liberty that had been sounded to them that's the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ it's true believe it's to have faith in his finished work and you see that Liberty it began he works Amen faith faith it begins to work this is why when you think when the Lord Jesus would stand there in Luke 4 and he would remember the priest delivered the scrolls unto him he found where it was written in the Book of Isaiah and he began to declare the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me and he goes down through all of those parts and categories to preach the gospel to the poor you know the poor eels he wasn't talking about that they didn't have no money Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom he ain't talking about people being poor within within there in them financial means he's talking about blessed are they who are who can come in humility to the world when the world said you can be free and the word brings conviction that there's a heart on the inside that's not full of the devil's pride but can stand there and say yes Lord I need deliverance from you I need your help Lord God I'll tell you what right now I'm standing here right now since God did a work there and getting a hold of my life in June of 1995 let me tell you say brother Samuel have you been standing by the grace of God for 25 years he's been my strength and my help hey man he's the one that changed this life and rearranged it for his glory he's the one it wants something that I did I could not do it he had to come and do it but he wooed me he drew me he drifted just like he draws his children I'm talking about solid ground tonight and Jesus would begin to say in closing up there he had come to preach the acceptable year the Lord preaching that of the Jubilee he goes on in that portion of Scripture in Luke 4 and he deals with how a prophet is not even accepted in his own country what was being sounded forth you know what they did they said I know him I know him I rubbed shoulders with him he was in and out of his daddy's car purred carpenter shop who in the world does he think he is I know who this is you see it's it's always something about it where people the greatest challenge is to recognize commonality things become common tune people can become common and they can no longer distinguish is it person or is it God I tell you that so that's a great embankment to that life because in order for any help to come you've got to recognize this ain't flesh it's God and Jesus let it be no no prophet is accepted in his own country he goes on to talk about in the days of Elijah under no other Widow was Elijah sent but one great famine was over the whole earth but one of them was sent one of them Elijah was sent to in the days from very in that statement in the time of leprosy was all over and yet many were in Israel lepers but not one of them was healed this is the scripture but naman Assyrian these are Gentile representations but naman was sent to Elias is that right Elijah was sent and he received healing in his life means Savior leprosy he is a horrible condition leprosy will separate a man from NASA was in Israel it separates them from the economy of Israel it would separate them from even from the from even coming into the house of God but remember like Moses remember God told Moses put your hand in your bosom he put it in his bosom pulled it out it was leprous it was showing that man's heart is leprous that's where the leprosy is but he said put your hand back in your bosom and he put the hand back in his bosom and pulled it out and it was completely clear what was it showing it was showing a complete work of the hand of Almighty God when God would come down and God would do a work to separate that leprosy of unbelief that was on the inside this is God's work who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect this is a Liberty the where when tests and trials and things come our way we've got ground we're standing on that's why the applying of the token when you're praying for your children you're praying for different ones you are praying with an authority of what God has done in your life amen you are praying with an authority you have met God you know him to be the same yesterday today forever he has changed your life glory be to God the very desire of sin is gone you see when you can look back look back you see many times it helps us look back he called you clean the life up from sin remember God don't take anything from anybody's life he don't forcefully take nothing he don't do it that way because he wants you to love him amen think of it he's brought you here he saved you he cleans you up he filled you with the Holy Ghost that gives you a perfect setting for faith when you know those things that gives you courage Amen you know where you're standing this is why when the scripture word long and here as I was thinking of these things here for some weeks the Lord just directing my heart to that where all things work together and we look in verse 35 where we read who shall separate us from the love of Christ it goes into naming things tribulation or distress persecution famine nakedness peril or sword for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter what plough is letting us know here is the same thing he would write over in 2nd Corinthians 4 that it is our dying that the life of Christ might be made manifest because we can just really be real honest all of us that are gathered as you're gathering in your room it is constantly a surrendering of our will to God's will that's the battle but remember as you are giving yourself to the Lord you gain the advantage over your own will I'll just say it plainly our own will is stubborn our own will is rebellious come on bat in the flesh man the flesh man I'm not talking about these calcium Potter's petroleum I'm talking about the flesh man the carnal man I want to remember he didn't get the Holy Ghost come on somebody God has set down in yourself your soul have been turned there come a change on the inside of your life is that right but they're here we find within it it's us even in the midst of these times surrendering submitting to the Lord looking to the Lord in these times it doesn't remove us it doesn't cause us to say well you know it's going to happen no it's in these times as even the Lord Jesus he was praying nevertheless not my will thy will be done he was praying earnestly even on his way to Calvary and Paul would say in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us who wants you to notice that scripture verse 35 it said who shall separate us and everyone these scriptures remember here's what's going through hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo is that right because we're dealing with two powers and see the God's power the Holy Spirit or it's Satan and it's dealing with not a lot but who behind every tribulation every distress persecution famine nakedness pearl sword behind it is Satan now let me just deal with this here and bring this this is where a point that I just want to capitalize on here for a few moments it is not what but it is who that is bringing it and it is Satan that brings it by the permission from the Lord I mean just let's just look at this here for a moment you see one of the things that was a very a crucial thing in the false the RAM would tell us with job and I'll get to that in a moment but he said as long as Satan could make job think then it was God doing it to him he had him whipped why because there's no something's wrong with me that's why I joke now I'm gonna preach a little bit this was a lot you know I've preached on these things I've referred back to him and I know not everybody was here for me and my mind sometimes I feel like everybody was but you realized there came a time when joke gotten them three guys started coming around Bildad you know I fast and all those things like that you remember their conversation eventually Joe tried to start justifying himself they kept on talking and Joe kept on trying to answer him to job's eyes got off the lam and his eyes got on himself that's why when Ella who come he had some words to say to Jo and then here after Ella who has passed off and now Ella who makes a way think of this God did not come and then you know then Ella who shows up but notice Ella who a sacrifice had to move in a way to get Cho into a place that quad could come down and speak lip to hear Oh glory be to God in the highest Omaha to think of it here you know brother Ram has asked the question in questions and answers 1954 and you know there is a person with a very good question they said I cannot believe all these wars and everything going on that I cannot believe that my God would be doing that my God as a God of love a brother branham he picks this up and he's you know he speaks of it speaks of how this could be even a bosom friend he said I don't know who it is but he said how that they have said my God is a God of love my god is love and wouldn't do this wars are of Satan he said I'll agree with you that Wars is of Satan that's exactly he's a prince of this world every Kingdom every nation in this world belongs to Satan God said they did in his word Satan said they're mine you remember the scripture G took Jesus up and showed them all in the Book of Revelations it speaks in the coming of that a millennium to where the kingdoms become them of the cry of the Lord and of his Christ so all the Satan is in control and all the kingdoms belong to him but Jesus he admitted they were but he was going to fall heir to them after a while Jesus will will have no more wars then that's a promise out of Isaiah but God even in Hell Psalms but God permits Satan to do this for correction and for judgment brother brandon picks it up and he says that continuing on he says who was it that permitted the evil to come down and Satan to go out and destroy the most perfect servant of God until Jesus Christ his children and everything else he had job God sent a wicked spirit out there and destroyed all of jobs children and everything just to test his servant all he said I could stand here for hours showing you my brother and sister whoever you are don't you get this spirit of God mixed up what's he calling it - don't you get this spirit of God mix up see it's coming to bring really a discernment of what's at work he said Wohlers are God's judgments upon the nation's destructions are sent of God and God is a God of love but god is a god of Wrath also see this is what a God of imagination leaves out that he's somehow oh he God you know oh surely God won't do this he leaves out a god of Wrath but I tell you what we need a god of Wrath we need him to come and execute judgment on that old sin nature come on somebody a man where he's able to bring a separation and loosen a certain and honor God who's imprisoned on the inside we need that God to come and execute judgment and remove him who is the head of that life so that he might be the head of that life hey man remember the word came not to the married woman of Zarephath but to the will of Serapis she had been loosed from her head and then she was ready for headship of the word are you with me now now notice is sets this sets forth the whole program of God me just say it before the devil was ever the devil before there was ever Stardust out of molecule let's go back him before that before there was any Angels any thing else it was Elohim the whole program was already laid out in the mind of God amen now these things let me just kind of pick them up and refer to him you see this is where the ground the solid ground that we are standing on as believers and to recognize that how that God will permit Satan to make a move and to work remember when things happened in Acts chapter 4 I have just referred to it for sake of time when they were let go from the hands of you know of the rulers of the Pharisees they returned back to their own company the Bible says in acts 4:23 and they themselves begin to pray I've referred to this prayer many times but this is what they said in verse 24 they said Lord thou art God which made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing they are declaring by a witness in their life that this situation is not above God but God is above it he's already spoke what they were witnessing they were declaring by the unction of the Spirit this is what the spirit spoke through David in Psalms 2 you see what the Spirit of God did it identified the moment in the hour in the word now look what happened to them they themselves receive a refilling of the Holy Ghost in this time and they say Lord granite that thy servants they might do we might go forth with all boldness that thou would stretch forth that hand to heal it's a time of pressure there was a time of persecution as I said before this is not a time of persecution but it's still a time God is working come on somebody this is a time God is working and to think they identified these are the things I want you to look here in verse 28 how they identified it for he says for a truth verse 27 against that Holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together people were gathered together that couldn't even stand one another well was it they were assembling and gathering together against the revealed word of the hour don't even agree on doctrine but notice what happened the light presses the darkness together here's what he goes on to say for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done they were telling Dave they were this was a confession to the Lord we know you're over all these things we know that there's no we could not have been thrown in that prison we know that this persecution and all this could not have come unless you had permitted the enemy to come in this way so what was it it was not time for them to cave in they were standing upon the grounds that had been given to them as believers what I'm telling you I think it's time you stand upon the grounds that God has given to us as believers it's not enough to read about it and ain't enough even to know about it it's take the ground that belongs to you and exercise your Dominion as a son and daughter of God God let it be known I've read these scriptures many times to you here over the past months he told him in Exodus 15:26 let me just refer to it he said I will put none of the diseases upon you that I brought upon the Egyptians Yeah right notice who brought him upon the Egyptians God permitted it come on friends God in a disease but it was spoken and when the word that her hearing was the spoken and it was turned loose because of Pharaoh he rejected all he's seen was a man who looked like a vagabond a man who looked like forgive me for saying this man who is this guy I'm Pharaoh this was the most powerful nation in the earth and he looked at it in a manner me you want me to bow to you but he failed to recognize here was one though he looked very meek and lowly but it was not him he was packing the word of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords he was packing a message that was come to breathe liberty it was according to the promise of cause announcing his visitation and confirmed by the pillar of fire Pharaoh did not know who he was dealing with he won deal him with Moses no sir and this one the same Moses you seen before when you can't win what he did he took off and he ran like a scaredy cat you ain't dealing with the same guy you're dealing with a guy who's been illuminated by the promise there's been a courage and a boldness that's rose up in his life because he knows it is not by his power or by his mind it's the same God he met that same God the angel of the Lord that was there in that burning bush that was burning and did not consume that same angel the Lord the same presence of God the same spirit of God it came there and he moved within Moses brother that's exactly the way the Holy Ghost does in a life well my comes in as a consuming fire it consumes all the world and yet here you are the same old temple but there is a living fire the inside hey man it becomes a living witness as he was amazed the bushes on fire but it ain't consumed I'm telling you when the Holy Ghost is come up you have been set on fire whoo man I feel good though repeater God hallelujah he said output none of the evil diseases I want you to watch this word I don't want preach on this right now but I almost can't help it you know this this word as they went forth the word had the boundaries when the word went forth it permitted the lice he permitted disease he permitted the boils it permitted the viruses it permitted those things to come like that but remember the word laid boundary and said you cannot come upon Gosha glory minute god oh my let me just tell you there's no other place of safety but in Jesus Christ amen let all the plagues and everything wage war and things come but brother when you're anchored in Jesus Christ oh he can come upon this flesh but he can never get to this song this soul is safely sealed in the presence of Jesus Christ let me just run through this here just a moment and forgive me for saying running through it but just to put the point when Satan in Joe born if I just let me refer to a few places when he comes there to job uh-huh and it begins to talk you know and remember what he accuses god of he said you've got him all hedged up that's verse ten now what you think about how God's got him hedged up the Bible said that the angels of God are encamped round about them that fear him and love his name you are your hedge about his house you're about everything he hath on every side you see when you're in him you're looking to see the eagle you look and see the man you look and see the ox you look and see the line you see you are under the protection of the throne guards out of the word and our protection is when it come time for the ox anointing to move and maybe we've just got to subject and submit ourselves let our opinion go it moves upon our life when it's time for the lie just step forth and stand with the boldness and say no sir devil you have no foothold here the Spirit of God will manifest that characteristic through the children of God when it's time for things to be snatched away that of a child of God that's yielded and battle the anointing of the eagle moves in and it lifts us onto higher ground when it comes time to be wise as a serpent and harmless as a duck the man anointing steps in Oh glory be to God you see we are hedged about and Satan knows us well Satan is saying I can't get to him Satan let him know here brother bran would go in to dramatize this and I have heard but now I see Balarama tell us in that message I've heard but now I see he said when God came or when Satan came to God and begin to accuse he said God responded to Satan and says you can't make him do it what Satan says I'm making curse you Gervase he said you can't make him do it blue grant tells the sin and I've heard but now see and of course that's you know of going upon the words you know to put it pretty simple for you and I but notice I want you to catch these words verse 11 here Satan says but put forth thine hand talking to God and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to your face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in that power you see Satan can't even bring anything your way unless it gets permission sometimes you think I gotta ask mom and dad or maybe I mean why don't I have to text my wife dad or well I says why don't have to text my husband dad you know I'm just gonna run to the store and do this or whatever here I'm just want to show you something right now Satan can't even give you a toothache he's got to get permission only upon himself put forth not thine own hand see God would have to pull back his hand but there's boundaries God said only so far is that right then notice here in the scriptures and I'm coming down when Satan touches all that he hath the Bible says in verse 15 the Sabian's came and they took the oxen who stirred up the Sabian's to come down there Satan did are you with who put within that heart to go after that I'll go after that oxen Satan did men the Bible says in verse 16 the fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep let me clarify this point fire of God that means lightning let me just keep on working with this right here I'm talking about lightning verse 17 the Chaldeans came out in bands and took away the camels in verse 17 then it goes on to talk about in verse 18 and verse 19 when job's children were gathered together eating and drinking in the eldest brother's house notice verse 19 and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness who was in the lightning who was in the wind Satan the Bible says in Ephesians 2 he is the Prince and power of the air notice how brother Anna puts it in future home this is why even as we head into the Millennium even going into the Millennium remember coming into the Millennium there's going to be a baptism of fire because also an issuing of fire is a cleansing it comes in to them we as we come in to the Millennium this is where even in the millennium diseases are done away with germs are done away with Satan's Satan's bound with a chain of circumstance are you with me now Satan is bound is that right and to think of all of this of that will take place wouldn't even as it would come under the rulership just in the Millennium now under the rulership of the Lord Jesus Christ and the sons and daughters of God but yet now he is the Prince and power of the air what troubled him says it he said he keeps off or wars off the blessings from God talking about remember when Daniel was praying he prayed for 21 days and he prayed and remember as Gabriel was coming with an answer he got stopped by the Prince of Persia the Prince of Persia was a demon that was in charge of that area remember Jesus member was taken up on the Mount and Satan said I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world if you will bow down and worship me there is a spirit over every nation come on when those angels fail when the rebellion was led in heaven and remember that was a third of them that were cast out remember they never lost their rank they kept their ranks coming down here this is why over government's over States over counties and over cities think of this when the Prophet was standing there out there in Oregon and that mania it was not a man who was a maniac here was it was demon powers that had that man bound and he came to that platform and he challenged there the Prophet and brother Graham said the Holy Ghost accepted Satan's challenge and he said you will fall across my feet this night that was not William Branham speaking it was the Holy Spirit using the voice of brother Branham that was surrendered to God and what happened there night that man drew back he spit in his face again and when he went to hit him he was like the wind left him and he fell across his feet brother branham said at that moment he said everybody in cots in wheelchairs everyone that was sick they got up he said - what happened is every one of those demons that were lower imps they saw the chief of their tribe had been defeated Alleluia what happened there they couldn't stand when their chief had been defeated there's a demon over this city come on now there's demons over these states demons over these countries the reason wars come about God permits it brother Graham so what happens is these spirits get jealous of one another seeing Satan's Kingdom it's a kingdom of positioning Hoban aren't you glad God delivers you from that he goes on to say in their in their The Prince and pound there in there comes Thunderbolts of lightning strikes the earth they need to rewrite the insurance plans other house we lived at I'll never forget one night man had the lightning it struck that house not only struck our house it struck the neighbor's house it knocked every one of their appliances out microwave stove refrigerator everything they had in their house it fried it one thing that hit on mine was my intercom system that went throughout the whole house but buddy I mean it was loud now you know what when I went to go make that claim I really didn't want to make the claim because I didn't want nothing to be against my record but I realized you know what this is a little bit more I'm not gonna be able to take care of this I better enforce my insurance but you know what they have on there and it's a bold-faced lie it says it's an act of God that's a lie it's not an act of God here when this said the fire of God fell from the sky it was not it was not God it's giving us it was lightning God permitted the lightning God permitted that great wind all of this then it came about upon job's life makes you want to go home and highlight out your insurance policy an act of Satan not an act of God notice how Joe would worship you know the Lord gave the Lord taketh away job was standing on his sacrifice the scripture goes on to say of how that the Lord notice what God says in job 2 3 I'm trying to come down and close now he says you know here's the God testifying a job he said he hold it fast his integrity although thou movers me against him to destroy him without cause you see this was not because job was a sinner Joe had a perfect sacrifice he had a perfect revelation in that sacrifice he had solid ground he would stand in there job do you know what's going on I don't do you know what's taking place no I don't jump do you know it's gonna come out I don't remember he stood his brother Hamid saying like this flat footed he said any new by being a prophet God visits by inspiration but he said he knew at that time I don't know what's taking place but God's in control you see Satan then answers him we know skin for skin verse four yay all that a man hath he will give for his life but put forth that hand now notice how Satan speaks to the Lord put forth valve on hand now touch his bone his flesh and he will curse thee to thy faith see if we stop right there in your mind - pervs say well it's God touching no it's not God touching God's moving back the hand to a certain place for Satan so Satan can move upon him and the Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life the Bible said he went forth in verse 7 and he smoked Jobe with boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown this is where the devil this is where Satan gets many people many times where they think everything ought to be good everything ought to be easy and this ought to be a picnic and let me just be honest friends every one of us all of everybody that's listening tonight there's not one of us that raises our hand and say you know what I love calamity if you're raising your hand let me go ahead and tell you you're lying because our flesh and our spirit does not like tribulation we don't like persecution we don't like famine we don't like anything that takes us out of the ordinary anything that puts a little bit of pressure we don't like it there right but yet within everything notice in this situation God permitted God was over it there was only so far that Satan could go this is why with sickness when sickness comes it's like even how close that this coronavirus how close has come to our own ranks who heads Ben you see he wasn't something to wear you know when we hear it even among others you see even when God is permitted we know it Satan God is permitted it it's a reminder as I've said before everything every sickness every test every trial everything comes away it's not just a molding and shaping of our character but it's a reminder this is not your resting place this is not our home if we had no discomfort we'd get more comfortable here we'd get more comfortable God doesn't want us to be comfortable here he wants us to be looking to him this world is not our home we're not of this world this is why when sickness and different things would come remember God takes us brother Brandon would take us back into the scriptures in Genesis 18 we're in that Abraham look at this mount here is Abraham standing in a time when the revealing of the son of man has come speaking of even a time that we're living in and he would make a statement then that you know that Lord you will not slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked be it far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right and brother Branham takes that up and he too answers a question he says brother Branham you say how can we how can a believer a believer get sick and he quotes that scripture shall not the judge of all the earth do right he said God will allow us sickness to come right back along and prove to you the resurrection God permits those things now let me close in this this scripture said may and all these things were more than conquerors I want to read that in the amplified version yay amid all these things we are more than conquerors and gain a surpassing victory through him who loved us how through him who loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is Christ Jesus our Lord do we understand everything as it's happening no no brother Brown I'm in a personal letter a personal letter to the stance cliff family you remember the stance cliff lamb family is the one that had the little baby over in Germany and they had a right of private military jet waiting it's a fly brother branham from here over there to pray for that baby it's all right but the Lord after brother Branham was praying and asking God the angel of the Lord told him don't touch this it's of the Lord now for our minds to be able to comprehend that there's no way I can comprehend that but I know one thing he does everything right and well blue brown would write to them and he said this is what he wrote to the stats for family it wasn't something that Satan slipped up on it was the plan and program of God brother sister stance cliff how can I make you see that now no more than I could when I went into the room and little Sharon and God refused to hear me see what he's saying there's no way for you to understand that now when I went through it with Sharon I couldn't understand it I couldn't understand it then how that would be his program but he said look what that little story has done it's brought thousands to Christ he said a few weeks ago I was out on the hillside riding to them I was out on the hillside and I was squirrel hunting then I thought when I came by a familiar place well things has changed a lot since then but I looked at the sorrow he said if things if you'd go through it would you do it if you had to go back over this was being asked to brother branham would you go back over it would you go back through that sorrow if you had to go back over life first he said I said I don't believe I would notice would you go back through the sorrow again no I don't believe I would hardships trials tribulations the Samuel thinks you went through as a pastor would you go back through him again first response is no no I wouldn't he said but now something said but look at the thousands of souls that's been saved you see there's experiences that come out of our lives and then you don't live the gospel neither do I preach the gospel without an experience and without experiences some by knowledge is by experiences he said god yes I told him yes then yes I'd go through it again anything for your kingdom remember because of that scene his little baby with cross eyes brother Brahim says he'll never be a cross side baby come across this platform and leave out without it being crew without it that's eyes being straightened there wasn't one baby that came across or a little child cross-eyed that he didn't make it to the other side its eyes was already streamed was able to enter in because of that need I'm telling you brother not only were their eyes straighten but there were lives that were turned around why all things work together for the good we don't know is is like what this virus that's a bonus and these things it's all around another sister we don't know but there's one thing we do know we're knowing whom we have believed you know what grounds you're standing on and we know that within all this right here nothing who shall be able to separate us who can do it tribulation nothing that Satan can bring can separate us from the love of God thank God for his anchor thank God for solid ground that we can stand on and I say tonight if you're not standing on solid ground get on solid ground tonight don't be between two opinions and has a nun straddling the fence come on the winning side amen get beneath the blood amen let's pray father Lord what rests and consolation that we have in you there is no other place of safety norther safe ground but inside of you and Lord to realize how that Lord that Satan would work always to bring destruction Lord he don't care you don't even care about his own those that serving him and foundling along with everything he don't he don't care about them even Lord a right move right in bringing that lord of that disease in that cell you don't he don't care Lord we know that none of these things can happen without you given permission you're over at all you're over every disease you're above it all your God the worst disease I can think of right now is sin the greatest plague I can talk think about the spiritual death that's the last plague that hit Egypt with spiritual death and lorn that last plague is not coming it's already come it's right here oh god I pray tonight if there's one Lord outside of a fool tonight may they run to the place of safety may they run into that city of refuge Lord and take refuge in the love of God Lord would set him free Oh father tonight I pray some of your children Lord going through different difficulties things Lord God that some things Lord that are connected with what we're going through Lord not just in our nation but around the world your God the others Lord suffering Lord there's even sickness and others Lord around us there's so many different needs but lord I pray tonight may we be found standing like Jobe flat-footed resting in you Lord knowing that God we've got a perfect sacrifice and by the life of that sacrifice in us it has brought us under the blood we are standing there Lord in safety that's the solid ground that's solid ground that's the ground Lord of rapture I pray God tonight may you just Lord move right there in those living rooms right upon every heart God may you just settle every doubt what if there be any fear made a perfect love of God just cast it out Lord you're faithful to your word every promise you've made Lord you back it up we love you and we thank you tonight father in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] you know I think of even when sickness sometimes it comes sometimes God we know sometimes God have permit that sickness sometimes to correct us if he needs to correct us a little bit remember how God would allow Paul his eyes would flare up every once in a while Paul was able to identify there was a messenger of Satan that had come to buffett me God didn't hmm you know change his eyesight make his eyesight go bad and then come back didn't remember Satan came to afflict him but there was only boundaries where he could go to but in all of that Paul realized he said I'm not going to complain I'm gonna glory in my infirmities Paul was not going around and say oh I'm so glad that I can't see right this is a blessing of God no no that's not what it means it means he glory God let him know Paul I already heard your prayer you've sucked me three times for this to remove it but Paul want you to know I don't ever want you to rise too high in your own thinking I don't want you to ever get to where you get too dependent on yourself to get to thinking it's you I want you to stay in a place my son where you're yielded your humble where I can use you I want to show myself to you I want to use you and I've got to make sure you're available so Paul said our glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon that very portion of scripture meant just like the tabernacle was pitched in the wilderness and the glory of God would come down when everything was set just right that the power of Christ may rest upon me so the Lord helped me to look to you tell me not to murmur and complain help me to look to You Lord say father you're in control you're leading me Lord Jesus I'm not above where some of these where things cannot touch me I need your grace Lord every day in my life like your prophet would tell us if God would move his hand Satan would take our lives but he said old God keep your hand up on me until you're finished with me Lord Lord Jesus help us tonight as we realize all things work together for good to them that love God and are called according to your purpose we thank you for your mercy Lord thank you Lord Jesus for your strength that you've given to us forgive us Lord when we've murdered and complained that just seems to be a part Lord that's just a tendency within this first nature we're always looking for a way out the Lord help us help us to look to you and trust in you Lord to let us know these things that you would permit to even come our way they it calls us Lord to rest find our trust in you Lord you're working you're moving in my life Lord help me purge out of my life Lord God that I might be fruit berry granite Lord we thank you Lord for your mercy in this island or in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music] Oh [Music] yes I [Music] oh gee [Music] fine [Music] yes I'd learn Oh oh yes I [Applause] [Music] fine then [Music] Oh [Music] amen I'm so glad about that aren't you and God bless you tonight just let you be dismissed in the name of the Lord on a sail said they Paul already mentioned it but I want to wish Benjamin a happy birthday so appreciate in his life they God continued to guide and direct us god bless you tonight the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
