[34:25] the desire that we have in our hearts

[34:30] together there's one desire that we have

[34:45] this service this evening
[34:47] amen I certainly believe that as God
[34:50] gives us Grace to be able to gather
[34:51] together as young people I certainly
[34:54] know that God has something special
[34:57] for you you know I always go back to
[34:59] that and I think of how when brother
[35:01] Branham he said when I was caught up
[35:03] there
[35:04] when those seven angels He said in that
[35:06] cloud he said he spoke something to me
[35:09] concerning you young people
[35:12] and I
[35:13] to me it's the same thing that God has
[35:16] promised
[35:18] for every person and that is a fresh
[35:21] experience of Christ in you
[35:24] doesn't matter your age amen it's for
[35:27] you and I believe dear tonight that our
[35:30] desire as we come and manage just so
[35:32] good to see each one of you amen
[35:34] whatever your desire is
[35:36] God knows and he already has it in mind
[35:39] and you know the thing of it is is
[35:41] brother Ronnie studied God has led him
[35:44] in Inspiration but you know ultimately
[35:46] it's your needs that control this
[35:50] service here tonight if you'll just
[35:52] invite the Lord and say Lord take that
[35:55] gift that you place the brother-in-law
[35:56] in Ronnie's life

[37:07] place while the word's being preached
[37:10] I believe that I know that to be the
[37:12] truth there are things that God is going
[37:14] to do in this service in this meeting

[47:00] mighty way Lord in Jesus name may you
[47:03] open your word to us we pray amen amen
[47:06] thank you for the music and if you have
[47:08] your Bibles
[47:10] turn to the Book of Genesis
[47:13] first chapter
[47:25] you know Paul I don't know why
[47:26] everywhere jackets up here we just take
[47:28] them off
[47:33] all right
[47:34] Genesis the first chapter we could
[47:36] probably read this one by heart but in
[47:38] the beginning
[47:39] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[47:42] the Earth was without form and void and
[47:45] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[47:47] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[47:50] face of the waters in 26 and God said
[47:53] let us make man in our image after our
[47:55] likeness and let them have dominion over
[47:57] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[47:58] the air over the cattle and over all the
[48:01] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[48:03] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[48:05] man in his own image
[48:09] all right God created man in his own
[48:12] image
[48:13] in the image of God created he him male
[48:16] and female created he them and God saw
[48:19] everything in the 31st verse and God saw
[48:22] everything that he had made and behold
[48:24] it was very good somebody say very good
[48:28] so God looked upon everything that he
[48:30] had spent time creating
[48:32] and he said it was very good
[48:35] amen may God bless his word he may be
[48:37] seated tonight so for a few moments
[48:39] tonight we want to talk about Power in
[48:41] the Blood and the word of your testimony
[48:43] there's power in the blood and Power in
[48:47] the word of your testimony amen so we
[48:49] see here in Genesis we kind of come into
[48:51] this picture where Moses has has uh
[48:55] transcribed the what God's told him has
[48:58] happened in the beginning in Moses is
[48:59] Penning God's thoughts down and and and
[49:02] and God tells Moses like this and start
[49:04] it and in the beginning
[49:07] God created and so God spent this and
[49:10] you know there's there's there's this
[49:12] debate in uh in in the society about how
[49:15] old the world is and how old the Earth
[49:17] that we're standing on is and some say
[49:20] that it took 50 50 million years to
[49:22] create you know this world and all the
[49:24] stars to spin and and everything and I
[49:27] just I I don't dispute with them I think
[49:28] that could be the truth because in this
[49:30] part of God's creation there is no time
[49:32] there was no time in the Garden of Eden
[49:35] there was no time during this part of
[49:36] creation there was things spinning
[49:37] things happening things going on but as
[49:40] for man there was no time so all this
[49:42] was was revolving around and I believe
[49:44] God had this in his mind that he was
[49:46] thinking of of an earth right you know
[49:49] he's thinking of a that I'm going to
[49:51] create something and there's going to be
[49:52] a light for that and he he thinks of a
[49:54] son and a son comes out and however it
[49:57] came out whether it was a a spark off of
[49:59] of him or a a a bang or whatever
[50:02] happened but the sun is in existence out
[50:04] of God's creative power he spoke it and
[50:07] there was light right so the first thing
[50:08] we see here is it wasn't light is not
[50:11] the first thing that happened
[50:12] but God's speaking is the first thing
[50:15] that happened the first thing is God
[50:17] spoke it so there's power in the spoken
[50:20] word to create a light so the light was
[50:22] not the first thing to come but God's
[50:24] voice was the first thing to ever be in
[50:27] creation right and God God spoke this
[50:30] into creation and the Sun goes into
[50:31] orbit and and he and he speaks uh about
[50:34] a a little blue uh Circle that would be
[50:37] hanging in the middle of a black space
[50:39] and and there we have this globe that
[50:40] we're on right so just just bear with me
[50:43] for a moment I'm not teaching a class on
[50:45] on what is that even called astrology
[50:49] astronomy
[50:51] but God speaks these things into
[50:53] creation because that's what he's seen
[50:56] in his mind so he's speaking out what
[50:58] he's seen in his mind and and there
[51:01] there becomes a a tangible evidence of
[51:03] what God's thinking and he speaks out in
[51:06] the beginning there's light right and
[51:08] the Sun comes into existence and the
[51:10] earth goes around it now now science
[51:12] tells us that that the the calcium and
[51:15] the iron and the deposits in the Earth
[51:17] would take millions and millions and
[51:18] possibly billions of years to come into
[51:21] existence and I think that really
[51:23] excites me it gets me pretty fired up to
[51:25] think that God would spend 50 billion
[51:28] years creating a thing a circle in the
[51:31] middle of Darkness that would have
[51:33] calcium and iron and and all the
[51:35] deposits it would take to have a
[51:37] sustainable life in just the right
[51:39] distance from the Sun and the right
[51:41] gravitational pull from the Moon and he
[51:43] would spend millions of years creating
[51:45] this this vessel in the middle of
[51:47] Darkness but that's not even the main
[51:49] focal point of his creation so if he
[51:52] spent 50 million years creating the
[51:54] Earth that we stand on how much time did
[51:56] he spend been creating the focus of what
[51:59] would be on the earth this is just
[52:01] somewhere we spent 70 or 80 or 100 years
[52:03] and if he spent 50 million years wrote
[52:06] it designing this place that we would
[52:08] just walk on for a few months how much
[52:10] time did he spend thinking about you how
[52:14] much time and effort and creative power
[52:16] did he put into when he thought about
[52:18] his attributes this is just something
[52:20] that we're walking on is something that
[52:22] we're standing on but his actual thought
[52:25] expressed is you tonight I believe that
[52:27] there's more to us than we recognize I
[52:29] believe there's more going on behind our
[52:31] lives than we realize God thought so
[52:35] much of you that he spoke you into
[52:37] existence and not just threw you out
[52:38] here into the chaos of the world but he
[52:41] designed something so specific a way of
[52:45] Escape for you that you could come back
[52:47] to him so he cast his thoughts out right
[52:50] into creation knowing that they would
[52:52] return for his thoughts do not return to
[52:54] him void but they always complete the
[52:56] circle they always complete the pattern
[52:58] right so to get our text out of this
[53:00] we'll turn to the Book of Revelations
[53:02] the seventh chapter and there was war in
[53:05] heaven and Michael and his angels fought
[53:07] against the dragon the dragon fought it
[53:09] and his angels and prevailed not I love
[53:12] that scripture
[53:13] that's why the devil hates the Book of
[53:15] Revelations because it says right there
[53:16] and he prevailed not
[53:20] right so you're you're battling a
[53:22] defeated enemy
[53:23] he's already defeated we're just waiting
[53:25] for the defeat to develop so if we're
[53:28] waiting for the defeat to develop we're
[53:31] also witnessing the victory develop
[53:33] right
[53:35] we're witnessing the victory of this
[53:36] scripture developed so it's not so much
[53:38] that just Satan was defeated but we came
[53:41] out Victorious right
[53:43] and the Great Dragon and the Great
[53:45] Dragon was cast out that old serpent
[53:47] called the devil and Satan which to see
[53:49] with the whole world he was cast out
[53:50] into the Earth and his angels were cast
[53:52] out with him and I heard a loud voice
[53:54] saying in heaven now has come salvation
[53:56] and strength and the kingdom of our God
[53:58] and the power of His Christ for the
[54:00] accuser of our Brethren is cast down
[54:02] which accused them before our God day
[54:04] and night and they some we say they
[54:07] they overcame him by the blood of the
[54:10] lamb and by the word of their somebody
[54:12] say there
[54:14] their testimony they overcame him by the
[54:18] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[54:21] testimony now the word of Our Testimony
[54:23] is is an interesting thing brother Ben
[54:26] because it's not how we start
[54:29] now we look at Abraham's life
[54:31] and we look at how Abraham's Journey
[54:33] started out and and he was just a
[54:36] regular guy in a regular City having a
[54:39] regular job
[54:41] going to regular school
[54:43] there was no so what we would seem a
[54:46] supernatural you know and a lot of times
[54:48] as as young people were Believers and
[54:50] we've heard of the supernatural moves of
[54:52] God and we're looking for brother Paula
[54:54] a a light a gold beam to light up our
[54:57] path that we could walk on that Golden
[54:59] Road like a yellow brick road you know
[55:01] well Abraham didn't have that he was
[55:03] just a regular old guy
[55:04] going to his regular old job but inside
[55:08] of Abraham was a thought from God
[55:11] a seed that God put inside Abraham but
[55:14] Abraham didn't know it he was just going
[55:16] to work he was just you know having the
[55:18] same old in and outs and maybe some
[55:20] young people haven't got that far down
[55:22] the road but it doesn't get any better
[55:23] you just get up and you do the same
[55:24] thing without the Eternal work of God in
[55:27] your life there really is no point to
[55:30] this
[55:31] but with the Eternal seed in your life
[55:34] you're aware that this is just something
[55:36] that we have to do in this life but this
[55:38] is not who we are there's another me
[55:41] inside here that is crying for something
[55:43] greater and I believe we all have that
[55:45] in common here tonight that there's
[55:46] something inside of us that is reaching
[55:48] out for something greater than where
[55:50] we're at right now and I could say that
[55:52] confidently tonight to know that you all
[55:54] everyone that walked inside this door
[55:56] myself included can live higher than
[55:59] where we're living now can live in a
[56:01] better place than where we're living now
[56:02] can have more faith than what we have
[56:03] now and I believe that's why we come
[56:05] because we hunger and thirsteth after
[56:08] righteousness and the promises that we
[56:10] shall be filled right so this is this is
[56:13] Abraham's Abraham's life and he's just
[56:16] going through life and but all of a
[56:18] sudden one day he wakes up and maybe he
[56:20] doesn't feel different it doesn't you
[56:22] know the the sun's spinning exactly in
[56:23] the same place and everything looks
[56:25] exactly the same but God calls Abraham
[56:27] by name
[56:28] and tells him it's time to come out and
[56:32] go and and walk and take a walk with him
[56:36] right I would I would I would wonder if
[56:37] how many of us have heard that call
[56:40] right we're just going through life
[56:41] we're just going to school we're we're
[56:43] in our in and outs of days but there's
[56:45] something on the inside of us and at the
[56:47] appointed time God calls that seed and
[56:49] says it's time for this for this seed to
[56:52] be quick into my word and he calls us
[56:55] out by name and then we're not just a
[56:57] normal guy going to work or a normal guy
[56:59] going to school anymore or a normal
[57:01] sister working at a cafe somewhere but
[57:04] we're a a vessel of God that has an
[57:07] elect seed inside of us a thought of God
[57:10] and all of a sudden our name is written
[57:13] a whole testimony Abraham and we look at
[57:15] Abraham how he started out as an idol
[57:17] worshiper he started out as a as just a
[57:20] heathen a regular old Babylonian uh just
[57:22] a just a regular old guy on the Earth
[57:24] but it's not how you start that matters
[57:27] it's how you finish so when they write
[57:29] about Abraham's testimony they would say
[57:32] in Romans for what saith the scripture
[57:34] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[57:36] unto him for righteousness and he
[57:38] staggered not at the promise of God
[57:41] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[57:45] giving glory to God now you would think
[57:47] as a young person that Abraham's life he
[57:50] must have had he must have been without
[57:52] blame or without fault to have this
[57:54] great testimony written over his life
[57:56] but you know Abraham laughed at the
[57:58] promise of God before Sarah did
[58:00] Abraham laughed at God's promise before
[58:03] Sarah did he doubted the Lord's word but
[58:06] yet when his testimony is written about
[58:09] him it doesn't say that Abraham laughed
[58:11] at the promise of God it said Abraham
[58:13] was found faithful in every promise and
[58:18] stagger not but was strong in faith so
[58:21] it doesn't matter how you start it
[58:23] matters how you finish and you might
[58:25] feel like you've started out on the
[58:27] wrong track and you've made commitments
[58:28] to God and you've gone back on them or
[58:30] you've you've made an effort to get
[58:32] closer to God and you find yourself back
[58:34] in this scene but it doesn't matter how
[58:35] you start out it matters what you do
[58:38] from this moment on Abraham stagger
[58:41] nodded Promises of God through unbelief
[58:44] but was found faithful and what is the
[58:46] requirement of the church when he comes
[58:48] back to Rapture of a body out of this
[58:50] age will he find faith when he comes so
[58:54] it's not mattering how you're starting
[58:56] out this walk it matters what you do
[58:58] from this moment on how you're going to
[59:01] finish it now God did not call us to be
[59:03] starters God called us to be finishers
[59:05] God didn't call us to start into an age
[59:08] she called us to finish in age God
[59:11] didn't call us to start a Reformation of
[59:13] a word god called us to finish the
[59:15] restoration of his word in this age now
[59:18] this is a big responsibility for our
[59:20] young people to take onto their
[59:21] shoulders but God put you here because
[59:24] he knew you could handle the load
[59:26] brother Brown said the Holy Ghost knows
[59:28] the load you can handle and that's why
[59:30] you're here so don't think it odd that
[59:32] you're here in this age but God had
[59:34] thoughts of you and he placed you in
[59:36] this age and you're performing his word
[59:38] exactly how he thought of it remember
[59:41] it's not how you start
[59:44] he would say but watch carefully now and
[59:46] see this before there ever was a speck
[59:48] of Stardust before God was God and God
[59:51] is an object of adoration and no one was
[59:53] there to worship him so he was at that
[59:55] time only potentially God and he was
[59:57] known only as an eternal spirit the
[1:00:01] bride was already in his mind you see
[1:00:03] where you really began
[1:00:06] was not on such a such street or in such
[1:00:08] and such hospital or born to such and
[1:00:10] such parents the bride was already in
[1:00:13] the mind of God yes she was she was
[1:00:16] existing in his thoughts and what about
[1:00:19] those thoughts of God they are Eternal
[1:00:21] are they not
[1:00:23] the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask
[1:00:25] you are the thoughts of God eternal
[1:00:29] are the thoughts of God Eternal let's
[1:00:32] establish this down now
[1:00:34] amen yes yes God never had a thought
[1:00:37] that's going to have an end but the
[1:00:38] thoughts of God are Eternal right so you
[1:00:42] want to drive that point home write that
[1:00:43] down somebody the thoughts of God
[1:00:46] are eternal
[1:00:48] if you can see this
[1:00:50] now you've all agreed yes right
[1:00:53] if you can see this you will see many
[1:00:56] things
[1:00:57] so we've already said yes to this so now
[1:01:00] we have the promise we see that so now
[1:01:02] we can see many things God is
[1:01:05] unchangeable in both Essence and
[1:01:07] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:01:09] that already God is infinite in his
[1:01:11] ability so therefore he as God must be
[1:01:14] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[1:01:17] is he is not he is
[1:01:19] not now learning nor is he taking
[1:01:22] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[1:01:24] any time adding to his knowledge if he
[1:01:26] can add his knowledge then he is not
[1:01:28] omniscient the best way we could say is
[1:01:30] that sometime he will be
[1:01:32] but that is not scriptural he is
[1:01:35] omniscient he has never had a new
[1:01:39] thought about anything because all his
[1:01:43] thoughts let me say all
[1:01:44] all his thoughts he has always had and
[1:01:49] always will have and knows the end from
[1:01:51] the beginning because he is God thus the
[1:01:55] thoughts of God are Eternal and they are
[1:01:58] real some we say they are real
[1:02:01] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:02:04] blueprint he has drawn up in which one
[1:02:05] day will be translated into substance
[1:02:07] and form but they are already real and
[1:02:11] eternal and part of God
[1:02:14] already real so take this like this
[1:02:17] if I'm trying to describe to you uh what
[1:02:20] it's like to eat a Chick-fil-A
[1:02:22] and I say you know if you know if you
[1:02:24] get if you get the the four piece
[1:02:26] chicken strip and sometimes the the
[1:02:28] strips are a little shorter and
[1:02:30] sometimes they're a little longer but
[1:02:31] you still get four strips
[1:02:33] and I'm trying to describe this texture
[1:02:35] to you and I'm trying to portray that
[1:02:37] with my with my best description and
[1:02:39] sometimes you don't have the words
[1:02:41] explain to me how Chick-fil-A sauce
[1:02:43] tastes
[1:02:44] well it's a little bit like this a
[1:02:46] little bit smoky it's a little bit it's
[1:02:47] hard to describe right
[1:02:49] but in your best vocabulary you try to
[1:02:51] explain that
[1:02:53] but then the only way to really tell
[1:02:55] somebody what you're what you're doing
[1:02:56] with it is to bring them
[1:02:59] a number uh uh a four piece chicken
[1:03:02] strip
[1:03:04] with a Chick-fil-A sauce and then they
[1:03:07] can now have what you're explaining to
[1:03:09] them right
[1:03:10] so in the mind of God there's these
[1:03:13] thoughts right and many of you have your
[1:03:14] own thoughts going on you're thinking I
[1:03:16] wish this was over because now I'm
[1:03:17] hungry and Chick-fil-A is closed on
[1:03:19] Sunday anyway so there's no reason to be
[1:03:21] in a hurry
[1:03:22] and you're thinking that that all these
[1:03:24] different thoughts and this brother over
[1:03:26] here is probably snowboarding somewhere
[1:03:27] and this guy over here has probably got
[1:03:29] school tomorrow oh summer so you're
[1:03:31] probably
[1:03:32] you know thinking about how late you're
[1:03:34] gonna sleep in tomorrow and
[1:03:35] road is probably thinking about
[1:03:36] volleyball and
[1:03:38] you know we all have thoughts going on
[1:03:40] in our mind
[1:03:41] but we have a present tense to us that's
[1:03:43] here I hope
[1:03:46] and so we block out those other thoughts
[1:03:48] because there's a main thought in Focus
[1:03:49] right let me say that God has lots of
[1:03:52] thoughts going on in his mind he had
[1:03:54] thoughts about an earth and a world and
[1:03:55] a sun and all these things but those are
[1:03:57] those side thoughts that were in his
[1:03:58] mind but the main focus point of his
[1:04:01] thought is you
[1:04:03] you are the main thought of God so God
[1:04:06] is trying to describe in his scripture
[1:04:08] what it will be like when the bride
[1:04:10] comes into full view right with us the
[1:04:12] Believers at the end time coming to full
[1:04:14] view well I could just announce us
[1:04:16] tonight that we're here this is the full
[1:04:19] view of the word of God it doesn't it
[1:04:21] doesn't maybe look glorious in the
[1:04:22] outside world but it's glorious in the
[1:04:24] eyes of God the Youth of today in this
[1:04:27] message under her messenger is exactly
[1:04:29] how God's solid in his mind and he said
[1:04:32] they will overcome by my blood and the
[1:04:36] word of their testimony they will
[1:04:38] stagger not at the promises that I have
[1:04:40] given them to unbelief but they will be
[1:04:43] found faithful in every promise I want
[1:04:45] to encourage us tonight that we're not
[1:04:47] wandering out there wandering in circles
[1:04:49] but we're walking in the perfect plan of
[1:04:51] God that he has for our life he had
[1:04:54] thoughts of us he had thoughts of of
[1:04:57] people coming into this part of the
[1:04:59] world in this time in this age and here
[1:05:02] we are I want to just announced to the
[1:05:04] devil tonight here I am those thoughts
[1:05:07] of God that said you would be defeated
[1:05:09] the victory part of that prophecy here I
[1:05:12] am
[1:05:13] and they cast him into the Lake of Fire
[1:05:15] you know how they did that they didn't
[1:05:17] give him anything to work with well I
[1:05:19] would say young people locked the devil
[1:05:21] up in your mind tonight don't give him
[1:05:23] anything to work with when he comes
[1:05:26] against you says well you know you're
[1:05:27] not going to make it or you're not going
[1:05:28] to have enough Faith don't give him
[1:05:30] anything to work with don't give him any
[1:05:32] room for that don't the scripture says
[1:05:35] don't give room to the devil
[1:05:37] don't give him room in your mind to
[1:05:38] think well uh you know what it's a great
[1:05:40] word it's a promise Tower but I don't
[1:05:42] know if it's for me let me just say it
[1:05:44] is for you
[1:05:46] this message is for you this Rapture is
[1:05:50] for you there's catching away of a bride
[1:05:53] body is for you you didn't just get born
[1:05:56] into this had a chance you didn't come
[1:05:58] out of the world and this had a chance
[1:05:59] but God thought of you and at an
[1:06:02] intersection in your life he called you
[1:06:04] by name and you might not recognize that
[1:06:06] now young person but you've been called
[1:06:08] by name to come to this intersection in
[1:06:11] life that God could deal with your heart
[1:06:13] and he could say now it's time come
[1:06:15] follow me
[1:06:17] lay down all the things of the world lay
[1:06:19] down the weights and so easily beset you
[1:06:21] and come follow me that was the
[1:06:23] beginning of Abraham's Journey
[1:06:25] but there was a promise at the end of it
[1:06:30] so the Devil comes to us and he thinks
[1:06:31] well you know you doubted the word there
[1:06:33] and you doubted you you know you're not
[1:06:34] sure about this and you had a question
[1:06:37] and
[1:06:41] so I had a question
[1:06:43] I had a question about the message or I
[1:06:45] had a question about the prophet or I
[1:06:47] had a question about Jesus Christ or I
[1:06:48] had a question about this or that and
[1:06:50] the devil will try to come down on you
[1:06:51] and say well see you're not really
[1:06:53] elected you questioned it no I don't
[1:06:56] read that anywhere in the scripture I
[1:06:58] read where Abraham staggered not even
[1:07:00] though his his actual Earthly Journey
[1:07:03] looks something like this and he went
[1:07:04] there and he went here and he went over
[1:07:06] there and he thought about this and but
[1:07:08] when it was written of him of his
[1:07:10] testimony it said he was found perfect
[1:07:12] in the word of God
[1:07:17] if we have it maybe we can put it up
[1:07:19] there for Psalms 139 brother
[1:07:22] this is a familiar scripture I think
[1:07:24] every you should have this written down
[1:07:25] somewhere where they can read in the
[1:07:26] room for thou has possessed my Reigns
[1:07:30] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[1:07:34] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[1:07:36] and wonderfully made marvelous how that
[1:07:39] works and that my soul knoweth it right
[1:07:41] well my substance was not hid from thee
[1:07:43] when I was made in secret and curiously
[1:07:45] wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth
[1:07:49] Thine Eyes did see my sustenance yet
[1:07:51] being unperfect and in thy book all my
[1:07:54] members were written which in
[1:07:56] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:07:58] there was none of them how precious also
[1:08:01] are thy thoughts
[1:08:03] unto me
[1:08:04] oh God how great is the sum of them if I
[1:08:08] should count them they are more in
[1:08:10] number than the sand when I am awake I
[1:08:12] am still with thee so I think well those
[1:08:14] are a lot of complicated words can I
[1:08:16] read this out of the Amplified version
[1:08:17] for you
[1:08:19] for you formed my innermost parts
[1:08:23] you knit me together in my mother's womb
[1:08:26] I will give thanks and praise to you for
[1:08:29] I am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:08:31] wonderful are your works and my soul
[1:08:34] knows it very well my frame was not
[1:08:37] hidden from you when I was being formed
[1:08:39] in secret and intricately and skillfully
[1:08:41] formed as if embroidered with many
[1:08:44] colors in the depths of the Earth
[1:08:46] your eyes have seen my unformed
[1:08:49] substance so the faith eyes of God
[1:08:53] the thought of God
[1:08:55] in his mind
[1:08:57] your eyes have seen me before I was
[1:08:59] formed
[1:09:00] and in your book
[1:09:02] were all written the days that were
[1:09:04] appointed for me when as yet there was
[1:09:07] not one of them even taking a shape
[1:09:11] so God saw today
[1:09:13] before there was ever a year to 2023
[1:09:16] before there ever was uh uh uh uh where
[1:09:20] are we Sheffield Ohio
[1:09:22] before there ever was a a tabernacle and
[1:09:25] pews and for your mama and daddy ever
[1:09:27] were or your grandpa and grandma ever
[1:09:29] were God saw this and already had this
[1:09:33] thought in his mind right before it ever
[1:09:35] taken shape how precious also are your
[1:09:38] thoughts to me oh God how vast is the
[1:09:40] sum of them and if I could count them
[1:09:42] they would outnumber the sand when I
[1:09:44] awake I am still with you so God has
[1:09:48] thought so intricately about us in this
[1:09:50] age and it's like if I can put it like
[1:09:52] this it's like an artist
[1:09:55] having something in his mind that he's
[1:09:58] he's God I'm not artistic I can't hardly
[1:10:00] draw I can't draw a stick figure brother
[1:10:02] I just you know but in my mind I can see
[1:10:05] something you know I can see a shadowing
[1:10:07] I could see that but brother Shane I try
[1:10:09] to write that out and it looks what were
[1:10:11] you trying to draw I'm not a good
[1:10:12] Pictionary partner
[1:10:15] but in my mind I can see it
[1:10:17] I can see what I would like to draw I
[1:10:19] could see what I would like to portray
[1:10:20] but I just can't get my hands and all
[1:10:22] the coordination to to match what I see
[1:10:24] in my mind but God's an artist
[1:10:27] God's the greatest artist that there
[1:10:29] ever was
[1:10:31] and he sees something within his mind
[1:10:33] and it's like it's like an artist trying
[1:10:35] to express like we think of a a van Gogh
[1:10:38] and he sees this woman and he sees it in
[1:10:40] his mind and he's he's gonna he's gonna
[1:10:42] paint it like he sees it in his mind and
[1:10:45] and it's Gotta It's gotta come to that
[1:10:47] perfect capture
[1:10:49] of what he's trying to describe to you
[1:10:51] now the best way for me to taste
[1:10:52] Chick-fil-A is for him to bring it to me
[1:10:55] and I have a visual
[1:10:57] I have a tangible thing right so Van
[1:11:00] Gogh could try to describe to you what
[1:11:02] he's he sees in this woman in this deep
[1:11:05] look in her eyes and it looks just like
[1:11:07] this but the best way for an artist to
[1:11:09] get that expression out of himself is to
[1:11:12] paint it
[1:11:13] and so he paints this picture called
[1:11:16] Mona Lisa and it has this captivation
[1:11:18] within its eyes and it seems to it seems
[1:11:21] to stare at you like a living a living
[1:11:23] creation because he's painted it in such
[1:11:26] a way that it captured what was the
[1:11:28] thought of him
[1:11:30] so you see God is the greatest artist
[1:11:32] that there ever was
[1:11:34] so you might think well if I was going
[1:11:35] to make the Mona Lisa I would make her
[1:11:37] look like you know I'd have her have you
[1:11:39] know you know bleach blonde hair and I
[1:11:42] would have her with you know this way
[1:11:43] and she'd have lipstick and makeup and
[1:11:45] this and that and you see how today they
[1:11:47] would have drawn her that way
[1:11:51] but he didn't think well I'm just going
[1:11:53] to draw the most beautiful woman that I
[1:11:55] can think of I'm going to draw the one I
[1:11:57] see in my mind
[1:11:59] I'm going to draw the one that I see
[1:12:02] exactly the way I want it to look I see
[1:12:04] exactly the expression on her face I see
[1:12:06] her eyes I see I see the way that she
[1:12:08] looks around the room when you walk to
[1:12:10] and you know if you ever get a good
[1:12:11] picture you ever seen a good picture and
[1:12:13] the eyes seem to follow you across the
[1:12:14] room and no matter where you go they're
[1:12:16] there because he's captured the essence
[1:12:18] of his thought
[1:12:20] he's he's captured his thought down and
[1:12:22] he's put it on and you know and and and
[1:12:24] they can tell a counterfeit by the
[1:12:27] stroke Direction
[1:12:29] and every picture is so intricately this
[1:12:32] artist's work and he's he's painted it
[1:12:35] just the way and and they can actually
[1:12:36] look at the stroke direction of this
[1:12:39] picture and they can tell whether it's
[1:12:40] fake or whether it's real because the
[1:12:42] artist has a signature way of the way he
[1:12:46] designs this painting and the way he
[1:12:48] makes it this expression of his thought
[1:12:50] and so somebody could come and our
[1:12:51] technology could paint this Mona Lisa
[1:12:54] picture for some reason I see it over
[1:12:55] here on this wall but he's he's painting
[1:12:58] this but he there's no way he can match
[1:13:00] the exact replication
[1:13:02] of what Van Gogh is painted because it
[1:13:05] was in Van Gogh's mind so you can look
[1:13:07] at the expression of it but you could
[1:13:08] never match it because you don't have
[1:13:10] the inspiration of where it came from
[1:13:12] the inspiration of where it came from
[1:13:14] was in the mind of the artist
[1:13:16] all right so now we're on track right
[1:13:19] so the devil's telling you that you're
[1:13:21] an impersonation of this and you should
[1:13:23] just walk away and you should just leave
[1:13:24] this alone and you're just pretending to
[1:13:27] get along with this until you turn 18 or
[1:13:28] maybe there's an elder in here an adult
[1:13:30] back there we're just impersonating this
[1:13:32] because we're scared to go to hell and
[1:13:34] we don't really know if it's for us but
[1:13:36] there's a certain design about you the
[1:13:39] inspiration in the mind of God has drawn
[1:13:42] you like he has seen you in his mind for
[1:13:45] he is the great artist and he has
[1:13:47] painted this picture of you and you are
[1:13:50] the exact thought of God and no
[1:13:53] impersonation can come along and try to
[1:13:55] match that because it didn't come from
[1:13:57] the same inspiration and there might be
[1:14:00] a you in the mirror that you see but
[1:14:02] that you in the mirror is not you but
[1:14:03] there's another you inside of there that
[1:14:06] God Drew in his mind he saw the thought
[1:14:09] and he expressed it in this age and he
[1:14:11] said I'm gonna draw Paul and he's gonna
[1:14:13] look like this is going to have these
[1:14:15] abilities he's going to have a smile
[1:14:17] that captures the room and I laugh that
[1:14:19] everybody gets in with I'm going to
[1:14:20] design Paul that he could be an element
[1:14:23] that'll be used as a gift of mine in
[1:14:25] this age to bring people to me
[1:14:27] and he portrays this attribute out into
[1:14:30] the Earth and this Paul that we see here
[1:14:33] is not actually Paul but there's another
[1:14:35] design on the inside of there that God
[1:14:39] saw before the foundation of the world
[1:14:41] and that thought was called Paul
[1:14:44] Browning
[1:14:45] and he said in my age at the end of time
[1:14:48] I'll need a young people rise up that
[1:14:51] will be able to not have walked with the
[1:14:52] prophet
[1:14:53] maybe never seen a miracle in your life
[1:14:56] maybe never witness the almighty hand of
[1:14:59] God appear in a room and ride on the
[1:15:00] wall maybe some of us have but I doubt
[1:15:03] whether many of us have
[1:15:06] but I'll think of thoughts that will be
[1:15:08] able to take me at my word
[1:15:12] and he began to paint
[1:15:15] and God knows what he's doing
[1:15:18] he knows how to get the result
[1:15:21] that he's wanting he's not an artist
[1:15:23] like I am where I would like to get this
[1:15:25] result but I just can't do it but God is
[1:15:27] the Divine artist
[1:15:29] and he begins to take things that you
[1:15:31] think that there would never be Beauty
[1:15:33] in
[1:15:34] and he begins to go to work on it
[1:15:37] you would think there'd never be Beauty
[1:15:39] in a woman called Rahab
[1:15:42] but the great artist begins to go to
[1:15:44] work there and he begins to work on her
[1:15:46] and he begins to call her by name and he
[1:15:49] begins to send under her a message right
[1:15:51] to her home and what was once uh
[1:15:54] something that you would never find
[1:15:55] beauty in there becomes an eternal value
[1:15:58] to it that cannot be reproduced or
[1:16:00] replaced because God thought of her in
[1:16:03] his mind
[1:16:05] they could have just went in and marched
[1:16:07] and taken down Jericho anytime they want
[1:16:08] but God had a Rahab there in his mind
[1:16:11] and I like this because I've never felt
[1:16:14] more in tune with Rahab than I do today
[1:16:16] because she was a gentile
[1:16:19] and this promise and this promised seed
[1:16:21] was to go over and to conquer and they
[1:16:23] could take that City Anytime they wanted
[1:16:25] but they could not because God had a
[1:16:27] Rahab inside Jericho and first Rahab had
[1:16:32] to have the message come to her so she
[1:16:35] could get on the boat and be saved
[1:16:37] if I could say it like that so she could
[1:16:39] get in the in the message and be saved
[1:16:43] so there was nothing beautiful about
[1:16:44] about rahabs you know seemingly her
[1:16:46] apartment wasn't great
[1:16:51] but there was an eternal value in there
[1:16:55] and God sent somebody right to that
[1:16:57] because that's the value he's looking
[1:16:59] for
[1:17:00] now what is the value
[1:17:03] of your soul
[1:17:05] you think well I'm just you know I'm
[1:17:07] just here I'm so-and-so said what's your
[1:17:08] dad's name
[1:17:09] Jesse so I'm just Jessie's son and and
[1:17:12] you know I'm just here on this Earth and
[1:17:14] this is but there's a greater value to
[1:17:16] you than that
[1:17:17] there's a greater value than whatever
[1:17:19] Earthly possessions you have or you hope
[1:17:21] to have or the career in mind that you
[1:17:23] have there's a greater value in there
[1:17:26] because God thought of it and it's
[1:17:28] Eternal value now remember we all agreed
[1:17:30] everybody agreed your your commitment
[1:17:31] with me that God's thoughts are eternal
[1:17:35] okay
[1:17:37] God's thoughts are still Eternal when
[1:17:38] they're expressed
[1:17:40] God's thoughts still don't have an end
[1:17:42] even after their Express so now you're
[1:17:44] here as a thought of God but you are
[1:17:46] still Eternal now you're here in this
[1:17:49] body but you're still an eternal thought
[1:17:51] of God and I would say it like this God
[1:17:52] can take something that seemingly would
[1:17:54] have no value to the outside world I
[1:17:56] give the brother some slides brother
[1:17:58] show me that block of marble
[1:18:01] there's a block of marble here and you
[1:18:03] would think how how could we make
[1:18:05] something pretty out of this or
[1:18:07] beautiful out of this and
[1:18:09] and you think about your your own life
[1:18:12] you think well I failed and uh I've I've
[1:18:15] made mistakes and I've fallen short you
[1:18:17] think how can God make something
[1:18:19] beautiful out of my life
[1:18:22] but then you begin to look at the the
[1:18:23] mind of the artist do we not have it
[1:18:25] it's okay
[1:18:27] there's a beautiful
[1:18:28] scenery
[1:18:31] okay here we go
[1:18:33] is there anything beautiful about that
[1:18:36] it just looks like hard work to me
[1:18:44] looks like a lot of a lot of the packing
[1:18:47] to do
[1:18:48] I'm thinking about dollies and cranes
[1:18:50] and how we're going to get that moved
[1:18:52] but you see God looks looks at something
[1:18:54] like that and he doesn't see it for the
[1:18:56] face value
[1:18:58] he sees it for what he knows is already
[1:19:00] on the inside of it because he knows as
[1:19:03] the great artist what he's put on the
[1:19:05] inside of it we can see the next picture
[1:19:07] brother
[1:19:09] not that one
[1:19:15] now that came from that block
[1:19:19] now how did Michelangelo look at that
[1:19:22] granted
[1:19:23] and see that brother Shana just baffles
[1:19:25] because I'm not an artist I I just can't
[1:19:27] I can't see that but he could see this
[1:19:29] this block of granite and he could go to
[1:19:32] work with his chisel and his hammer and
[1:19:34] I don't know what it took 30 years
[1:19:36] and he sees a Moses and I'm gonna have
[1:19:38] Moses is going to be holding the
[1:19:40] Commandments and I see this in my mind
[1:19:41] but the only way to get this expressed
[1:19:44] out is to make it I've got to have a
[1:19:47] slab of granite and I've got to make
[1:19:49] this expression that I have in my mind
[1:19:51] and I've got to form it and I've got to
[1:19:53] work it and I'm gonna spend time on it
[1:19:55] now if we could have a better light it's
[1:19:57] better up here so you see the the the
[1:19:59] the detail intricately in there
[1:20:02] and you see this I read this one time
[1:20:05] this tendon in Moses's arm because his
[1:20:07] pinky over here see his pinky on the
[1:20:09] tablet is moved
[1:20:11] that pinky is the pinky that moves that
[1:20:13] tendon
[1:20:14] so if your hand was in that position
[1:20:16] that's exactly how your forearm would
[1:20:18] look you see the attention to detail
[1:20:20] that Michelangelo would put into this
[1:20:23] statue because he's the artist and he's
[1:20:25] seen this expression in his mind and
[1:20:28] he's so he wants a detail just perfectly
[1:20:30] now if Michelangelo an artist out there
[1:20:33] somewhere that probably didn't even know
[1:20:35] God or have a relationship with God but
[1:20:37] just wanted to make a statue of Moses
[1:20:39] now if an Earthly artist could have that
[1:20:42] attention to detail how much more the
[1:20:44] great artist in your life has paid
[1:20:47] attention to every detail that you are
[1:20:49] every thought that you've had every
[1:20:52] concern in your mind every complex that
[1:20:54] you deal with every fear you have the
[1:20:56] great artist has focused in on your life
[1:20:58] and he's aware of every detail because
[1:21:01] he made you exactly like he saw you in
[1:21:04] his mind he's the great artist
[1:21:06] he's the great artist that is coming
[1:21:08] he's created a beautiful bouquet of his
[1:21:11] artworks
[1:21:13] he's created a beautiful a slogan for
[1:21:15] his Works in this age
[1:21:17] this is Michelangelo's advertisement to
[1:21:20] the world of his what he thought Moses
[1:21:22] would look like right now I remember I
[1:21:25] remember driving down the road in
[1:21:27] Arizona and driving down uh from Tucson
[1:21:29] to Phoenix and on the side of the road
[1:21:31] there there's nothing to see it's just
[1:21:33] flattened you think Ohio's flat but that
[1:21:35] section of road is beyond flat there's
[1:21:37] nothing to do on that road but look
[1:21:38] around
[1:21:39] there's a billboard there on the side of
[1:21:41] the road and it says Divine Healing
[1:21:43] question mark this is 10 15 years ago
[1:21:45] I'm old
[1:21:48] it caught my attention Divine Healing
[1:21:51] and it just said William branham.org at
[1:21:53] the bottom I thought about that message
[1:21:54] but the Brandon preached
[1:21:56] we was driving along and he said there
[1:21:57] was billboard after billboard after
[1:21:59] billboard or just you know smut and
[1:22:01] advertisements and all the things of the
[1:22:02] world he said he got across this
[1:22:03] billboard and it just said hungry
[1:22:07] and it caught his attention
[1:22:09] because it was he was hungry there was
[1:22:11] an advertisement that grasped his
[1:22:13] attention
[1:22:14] and somebody thought of this
[1:22:16] advertisement to grasp the attention of
[1:22:18] people and they they create it in their
[1:22:20] mind an artist or what do they call them
[1:22:22] a marketing
[1:22:23] marketing somebody help me
[1:22:27] marketing something and
[1:22:29] and that marketing agent or whatever he
[1:22:32] is whatever his official job title is
[1:22:34] thinks of these ad slogans and he puts
[1:22:36] them on billboards now he spends all
[1:22:38] this time and all this money and all
[1:22:39] this effort and all this energy and he
[1:22:41] puts this giant billboard out there on
[1:22:43] the side of the road and he's made it
[1:22:45] exactly like he was and you know what
[1:22:46] brother Samuel sometimes we have to go
[1:22:47] into some inner cities somewhere or even
[1:22:49] on the other side of the world and you
[1:22:51] know what happens is this beautiful
[1:22:52] artwork that somebody has put out there
[1:22:55] somebody never fails sneaks in there
[1:23:00] and Graffitis
[1:23:02] over the top of this beautiful artwork
[1:23:05] you imagine if you were to go to the
[1:23:08] Louvre and you found the Mona Lisa and
[1:23:10] had graffiti over it
[1:23:12] and somebody has snuck in there not to
[1:23:14] steal it
[1:23:15] but to pain over the top of it
[1:23:18] and we see these train cars that were
[1:23:20] made and they go by and you guys live
[1:23:22] here in the hitting the Rust Belt you
[1:23:24] know and you see the Train the trains go
[1:23:25] by and you see the graffiti art going by
[1:23:27] and the graffiti and the graffiti well
[1:23:29] the guy that made that train never
[1:23:30] intended it for had to have big bubble
[1:23:32] words on the side of it
[1:23:34] but he intended it for the original
[1:23:36] message that was in there
[1:23:38] but somebody has stuck in and graffitied
[1:23:41] over the top of the original message
[1:23:43] that's underneath that now the message
[1:23:45] is still underneath on that billboard
[1:23:47] the original expression of that artist
[1:23:50] is still there but it's covered up with
[1:23:52] graffiti let me say to you tonight young
[1:23:54] person that there's an original
[1:23:56] expression of you that's in the mind of
[1:23:58] God and you're still that way in his
[1:24:00] mind if I could say it like this God
[1:24:02] took a perfect picture of you before
[1:24:04] there was sin before there was
[1:24:06] depression before there was anxiety
[1:24:08] before there was fear before there was a
[1:24:10] longing in your heart before there was
[1:24:12] any disappointments in your life God
[1:24:13] took a perfect picture of you and that's
[1:24:16] the way he sees you but what has
[1:24:17] happened is somebody has snuck in in the
[1:24:19] middle of the night and begin to
[1:24:21] Graffiti over your life and begin to say
[1:24:24] your name is depressed or your name is
[1:24:26] fearful or your name is not Overcomer or
[1:24:29] your name is uh just didn't have enough
[1:24:31] or your name is never gonna make it you
[1:24:34] see and the devil has come in and he's
[1:24:36] engraved over the top of the original
[1:24:37] message you see that's why we fight this
[1:24:40] in this age that the message is still
[1:24:42] the supreme authority because somebody
[1:24:44] has graffitied over the top of what
[1:24:46] really God's Prophet came to say and
[1:24:49] begin to apply their own paint over the
[1:24:51] top of the original message but they're
[1:24:53] still an original message under there
[1:24:55] we've just got to wash away the graffiti
[1:24:57] now the interesting thing about this is
[1:24:59] as those paintings are made with oil
[1:25:01] it's an oil type paint that they put
[1:25:04] down there and then somebody with the
[1:25:06] latex water-based paint has come over
[1:25:08] and sprayed over the top of that but
[1:25:10] that oil paint cannot be just washed
[1:25:12] away
[1:25:13] that oil paint cannot be wiped away with
[1:25:15] that water paint if you get enough of
[1:25:17] alcohol you get that rag a little bit
[1:25:19] hot that water-based paint will begin to
[1:25:22] come off so you see there's a real you
[1:25:24] under there
[1:25:25] under this under this this false
[1:25:28] accusation the accuser of our Brethren
[1:25:30] has accused us day and night before God
[1:25:33] spray painting over our lives to say
[1:25:35] you're this is the label you're going to
[1:25:37] wear well I think the Devil is a label
[1:25:39] maker
[1:25:40] he wants to label the church and call us
[1:25:42] holy rollers or call us up man followers
[1:25:45] or profit worshipers or he wants to
[1:25:47] label the church I don't care what the
[1:25:50] devil labels me
[1:25:52] his labels are not permanent
[1:25:55] like I say like that the label that the
[1:25:58] devil would put on the church is not the
[1:25:59] way God sees the church but God sees you
[1:26:03] as he thought of you in his mind and no
[1:26:05] matter what the devil would write over
[1:26:07] you there's still an original you there
[1:26:08] does that make sense so as as we go we
[1:26:11] can say it like this there's a canvas of
[1:26:13] our life
[1:26:15] and that canvas can read
[1:26:17] the word
[1:26:18] of Our Testimony
[1:26:21] and that word might say you might have
[1:26:23] walked in that door and that word
[1:26:24] tonight would say complexed
[1:26:28] fearful
[1:26:30] ashamed
[1:26:33] it says thirsty
[1:26:36] gone too far
[1:26:41] but that's not the original message
[1:26:46] that's not who you are
[1:26:49] there's another you underneath that
[1:26:52] there's another word of testimony under
[1:26:55] there
[1:26:56] am I making sense Church there's another
[1:26:59] Mark that's been made there there's
[1:27:02] another part of your testimony ye are
[1:27:04] our epistle written in our hearts known
[1:27:07] in red of all men for as much as ye are
[1:27:10] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[1:27:12] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:27:14] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:27:16] God not in tables of stone but in
[1:27:18] fleshly tables of the heart so if I
[1:27:21] could say break it down Paul's words
[1:27:22] here brother Ben you have a table
[1:27:25] a billboard
[1:27:27] on the inside of your heart
[1:27:29] that ink cannot touch how would you ever
[1:27:31] tattoo on the inside of your heart but
[1:27:35] there's a place there for a word
[1:27:38] to be written there that an ink pen
[1:27:41] cannot touch and the ink pen cannot
[1:27:43] access that but it's an advertisement a
[1:27:45] billboard that only one person can get
[1:27:48] to that place in your heart so the devil
[1:27:51] might have put tattoos over the top of
[1:27:52] your chest and you might have a tattoo
[1:27:54] here I'll pray young people don't but if
[1:27:56] the devil got you and you do it doesn't
[1:27:58] mean you're not saved or you're not
[1:27:59] going to make it or you're not worthy
[1:28:01] but there's another Mark that was
[1:28:03] already there before that tattoo ever
[1:28:05] came and that Mark was put there before
[1:28:07] the foundation of the world by the
[1:28:09] almighty God and he didn't just write it
[1:28:11] with ink but he wrote it in blood so now
[1:28:14] we see that it's by the blood of the
[1:28:17] lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:28:19] they shall overcome now I asked the
[1:28:22] church tonight who wants to be an
[1:28:23] overcomer who wants to overcome the
[1:28:26] devil on every opposition that he's
[1:28:28] given you in your life every fear he's
[1:28:30] planted in your mind every lie he's ever
[1:28:32] told you we will overcome him why
[1:28:35] because we have the blood of the lamb
[1:28:38] and the Word of Our Testimony so I would
[1:28:41] say tonight take your canvas and wash it
[1:28:44] you might have come in here and said I'm
[1:28:45] never I'm not bright material I'm never
[1:28:47] going to make it this just isn't for me
[1:28:49] but wash that off wash that canvas off
[1:28:51] and say I'm not going to take what the
[1:28:53] devil put on me but I'm gonna clean my
[1:28:55] slate tonight by the blood of the Lamb
[1:28:58] I'm washing away what the devil put on
[1:29:01] me I'm washing away at the LIE the devil
[1:29:03] has told me my whole life that I would
[1:29:05] not make it or I would not achieve this
[1:29:07] whoever told you that
[1:29:10] let me just ask the young folks in here
[1:29:11] tonight who told you that you would not
[1:29:13] make a rapture
[1:29:14] does your parents ever tell you that
[1:29:17] no did your pastor ever tell you that no
[1:29:21] did God ever tell you that no so we know
[1:29:24] where it came from it's a lie it's a
[1:29:28] bluff of the devil it's a lie let me
[1:29:31] just say that the prophet of our age had
[1:29:34] to go through the same battle right he
[1:29:36] comes out of that vision and there's a
[1:29:37] demon in his room and it says you don't
[1:29:40] have the power over me
[1:29:44] and many of us would think brother what
[1:29:45] would you think if a demon came in your
[1:29:47] room and it spoke to you and said you
[1:29:49] don't have the power over me if we don't
[1:29:50] know where we stand then we'd back up in
[1:29:53] the corner and we'd be afraid and we'd
[1:29:55] be fearful because that's that's a
[1:29:56] that's a fourth dimensional being
[1:29:58] speaking to us
[1:30:00] and it puts us in fear in check
[1:30:03] and even it happened to the prophet and
[1:30:04] he said he got he got back and he said
[1:30:06] devil
[1:30:08] you see he was calling brother Bama
[1:30:10] Bluff
[1:30:11] and that's what he was so the devil is
[1:30:14] saying that you're not going to make the
[1:30:16] Rapture because he's not going to make
[1:30:18] the Rapture the devil is telling you
[1:30:20] that you don't have enough Faith because
[1:30:22] he didn't have enough Faith the devil is
[1:30:25] telling you that you're unworthy
[1:30:26] unrighteous Unholy because he's unworthy
[1:30:29] unrighteous Unholy the devil is telling
[1:30:32] you that you're never going to receive
[1:30:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way
[1:30:35] that you want it because he's never
[1:30:37] received the baptism the Holy Ghost the
[1:30:39] way that he wants it you see he's he's a
[1:30:42] bluff
[1:30:43] and he's accusing us of his own sin and
[1:30:46] trying to paint that label over our life
[1:30:48] but we never did it in the first place
[1:30:50] the devil painted that over your life
[1:30:53] the devil told you that was going to be
[1:30:54] the end of your story The Devil told you
[1:30:56] that
[1:30:57] no no man from the pulpit ever told you
[1:31:00] that you're not gonna have enough to
[1:31:01] make it but we're here to encourage the
[1:31:03] faith of the people to say you're going
[1:31:05] to make it friend there's enough room at
[1:31:07] the cross for you there's enough blood
[1:31:11] amen so what the devil turned on you you
[1:31:14] turned right back on him and brother
[1:31:15] random rose up in faith and he said
[1:31:17] devil you're a bluff and you're an
[1:31:20] offense to me
[1:31:21] get thee behind me and you see the Devil
[1:31:23] Went
[1:31:24] you see he's got no power
[1:31:26] he's got no Power in the Blood because
[1:31:30] he has not applied the token
[1:31:33] well he can't
[1:31:35] that devil has told you you can't do it
[1:31:36] he can't do it
[1:31:38] recognize where it's coming from
[1:31:40] God did not come down in this age
[1:31:43] is this all right brother Samuel can I
[1:31:45] have some Liberty with this God did not
[1:31:47] come down in this age and keep a man
[1:31:49] away from alcohol and smoking and keep
[1:31:51] his life pure and and keep him away from
[1:31:53] all the influences of the world and use
[1:31:55] them in a mighty way and give him three
[1:31:57] pulls and give him signs in his life and
[1:31:58] come visit him over over the river and
[1:32:00] commission him to fulfill the work of
[1:32:02] John the Baptist for the coming bride to
[1:32:04] come to go through all that brother Ben
[1:32:06] can you imagine God go through all that
[1:32:07] to save a man to preach a message to
[1:32:09] tell me that I'm not going to make it
[1:32:15] what do we read when we read the message
[1:32:18] do we read judgment and condemnation
[1:32:21] fear do we read accusation do we read
[1:32:25] that there's just there's just we're
[1:32:26] just not going to make it there's no way
[1:32:28] we could ever make it is that what we
[1:32:29] read when we read the message brother
[1:32:30] Ray that's not what I read when I read
[1:32:32] the message you know what I read I read
[1:32:34] the message of Grace
[1:32:36] that I was The Sinner unworthy and
[1:32:38] should not be here where I am today but
[1:32:41] God rich and mercy came to where I am
[1:32:44] and I read that it's Grace Grace Grace
[1:32:47] to our age
[1:32:49] brother Branham is Elijah to the age but
[1:32:52] he's also zerubbabel crying Grace Grace
[1:32:56] Grace Grace it's the message message of
[1:32:59] grace to the church so wash off your
[1:33:01] sign that said guilty and unforgivable
[1:33:04] and write Grace over the top of it it's
[1:33:07] all Grace it's God's grace and God God
[1:33:10] has inscribed Grace on the table of your
[1:33:13] heart before there was a sin remember I
[1:33:16] will say it like this God beat that
[1:33:18] lying Spirit to you
[1:33:20] that lying Spirit that's bothered you it
[1:33:22] was he started my Old Testament prophets
[1:33:24] that lying Spirit but I'm gonna bring it
[1:33:26] down home the lying spirit that you
[1:33:28] battle with your entire life God beat
[1:33:30] that Spirit to you
[1:33:32] there's something underneath the label
[1:33:34] let me just say this
[1:33:36] you remember brother Samuel do you ever
[1:33:37] have a whole set of them read books
[1:33:39] the red books I was I was I kind of got
[1:33:41] in the ministry too late and I missed
[1:33:42] the window for the red books
[1:33:44] my dad had a set of red books and this
[1:33:46] was before everybody had the computer
[1:33:48] and the table and this was back in the
[1:33:50] folio days and you had to know a guy who
[1:33:52] knew a guy that had a computer
[1:33:53] to go search the message right
[1:33:58] the kids were blessed
[1:34:00] we are blessed in this age
[1:34:03] you see what's happened is it's not you
[1:34:04] don't have to rely on me just saying the
[1:34:06] quotes that I want to say but you can go
[1:34:09] read it for yourself
[1:34:10] you can go rightly divide the words
[1:34:12] yourself and read what the prophet
[1:34:14] actually said not just the parts I want
[1:34:15] you to hear before your time but that's
[1:34:17] what we had to endure
[1:34:19] but we're blessed
[1:34:21] and so there was this red book for the
[1:34:23] shame it was the seventh seal book
[1:34:25] my dad's one of my dad's favorite books
[1:34:27] duct taped you know just
[1:34:30] man he read that thing back and forth
[1:34:32] back and forth noted it all up you know
[1:34:33] well one day it went missing
[1:34:36] one day was gone
[1:34:38] I think it was probably two years
[1:34:40] it was missing went over to another
[1:34:42] brother's house in another state and
[1:34:43] we're visiting there having lunch
[1:34:46] brother's got a bookshelf and he's got
[1:34:48] all the red volumes
[1:34:52] my dad goes over there oh I was looking
[1:34:54] for a quote the other day
[1:34:57] do you mind if I read your seven sealed
[1:34:58] book and without even waiting for the
[1:35:00] guy to say yes he grabs it off the shelf
[1:35:01] and he starts flipping through it I said
[1:35:04] man that's a good note man you made a
[1:35:06] note right Ryan made a note
[1:35:08] you you you
[1:35:10] man you got you highlighted the same
[1:35:12] parts that I highlighted I'm beginning
[1:35:14] to get a little weird in the room I was
[1:35:15] just a little kid but I could feel that
[1:35:16] it got a little weird in the room
[1:35:20] my dad says this looks just like my
[1:35:22] handwriting
[1:35:24] there's a flip to the book this is my
[1:35:27] handwriting
[1:35:28] flips to the front of the book sure
[1:35:30] enough it says this brother's name right
[1:35:31] there in the book
[1:35:33] but there's a little peeling on the
[1:35:34] label
[1:35:39] it says this brother's name right on
[1:35:41] this book
[1:35:43] he said I'm sure that's my handwriting
[1:35:45] I'm sure those are my notes
[1:35:47] so he begins to peel back the label
[1:35:52] and that brother had put a label of his
[1:35:55] name right over the top of my dad's name
[1:35:57] and they're friends I mean they keep in
[1:35:59] touch regular bases back then
[1:36:06] or so you think
[1:36:08] but the devil's not your friend
[1:36:12] the devil's not your buddy
[1:36:14] that was my dad's book that somebody
[1:36:16] just came and put their name right over
[1:36:18] the top of it you imagine somebody just
[1:36:21] taking your your Milwaukee battery on a
[1:36:24] job site and you've got your name
[1:36:26] engraved on there and somebody come
[1:36:27] write their name and Sharpie right over
[1:36:29] it but you know if they take the battery
[1:36:31] out and on the inside of that on the
[1:36:32] inside of the thing you took the time to
[1:36:34] engrave your name there so there was a
[1:36:36] name there before the thief got a hold
[1:36:38] of it
[1:36:39] and there's a name on you before
[1:36:41] depression got a hold of you and there's
[1:36:44] a name on you before a live Spirit got a
[1:36:46] hold of you there's a name on you before
[1:36:48] defeat got a hold of you there's a name
[1:36:50] on the church before the devil got a
[1:36:52] hold of you and wanted to paint you as a
[1:36:54] Holy Roller or a Pentecostal or a
[1:36:56] wildfire I don't care what label you put
[1:36:59] on me there's already a label on me by
[1:37:01] God Almighty he said I'm worthy he said
[1:37:05] I'm chosen he said I'm elected he sent
[1:37:08] him the apple of his eye he says I'm
[1:37:10] Without Blame without spot without
[1:37:12] wrinkle that's what I read when I read
[1:37:15] the message I don't read condemnation I
[1:37:17] don't read fear I don't read remorse I
[1:37:19] don't read regret I read victory
[1:37:22] I read Victory and they overcame by the
[1:37:25] blood of the Lamb washing their slate
[1:37:27] clean washing their clean now brother
[1:37:29] Ben if we don't dip in that house up and
[1:37:31] dip it in that blood and wash it over
[1:37:33] our door posts it ain't gonna do no good
[1:37:36] we've got a clean slate tonight come
[1:37:39] under the Fountain of the water of
[1:37:40] repentance and you have a clean slate
[1:37:43] tonight whatever you've been through
[1:37:44] whatever you've done thought or said it
[1:37:47] don't matter because there's still
[1:37:48] breath in your lungs so you have the
[1:37:50] same right to repentance that there ever
[1:37:52] was even from when you were a child the
[1:37:54] same innocence to come under
[1:37:56] the repentance of God's blood
[1:37:58] and say I'm sorry well now
[1:38:01] you have a clean slate
[1:38:03] what are you going to do with it
[1:38:06] if David or Joshua excuse me if Joshua
[1:38:09] would have just left that bucket of
[1:38:10] blood in there and you thought God
[1:38:12] provided this blood sacrifice for us
[1:38:14] and the Death Angel is going to come
[1:38:15] here
[1:38:16] but I don't feel like going outside and
[1:38:18] applying it
[1:38:19] I don't want to be identified
[1:38:22] with this blood that Death Angel would
[1:38:24] have come right in his house and taken
[1:38:25] his life and any other firstborn's life
[1:38:27] in that room
[1:38:28] but Joshua didn't think that Joshua
[1:38:31] thought there's a bucket of blood here
[1:38:32] I've got some simple Faith here I'm
[1:38:35] going to dip it in this blood and I'm
[1:38:36] gonna go out and I'm going to wash the
[1:38:38] dark post I'm gonna wash it over here
[1:38:40] wash it over here you know if you ever
[1:38:42] paint it there's a hard time to stop you
[1:38:44] just want to finish the whole wall I
[1:38:45] believe Joshua just took that and he
[1:38:47] kept dipping it in there and he kept
[1:38:49] dipping it in there you know what it
[1:38:50] never ran out every time he dipped it in
[1:38:52] there there was more blood and he dipped
[1:38:54] it again and there was more blood I
[1:38:56] think Joshua's whole house was red by
[1:38:58] the time he was done because he wanted
[1:38:59] to be sure that the death angel knew he
[1:39:02] was one of the few and I think we should
[1:39:05] be so short tonight that nobody would
[1:39:08] have to ask us what we believe or who we
[1:39:11] are or what we think about this message
[1:39:13] called Christ but it would be so
[1:39:15] thoroughly identified across our life
[1:39:18] Lord let your blood paint me tonight
[1:39:21] and you have a word to write on the
[1:39:23] table of your heart
[1:39:25] there's a word there a name
[1:39:28] above every other name written on the
[1:39:32] table of your heart and it's written
[1:39:34] there by Blood now when John saw his
[1:39:36] name written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:38] it wasn't so much that John just saw his
[1:39:40] name there I thought Glory Hallelujah
[1:39:42] I'm gonna make it but John had a
[1:39:44] revelation to know that when he saw his
[1:39:47] name revealed in the book it was
[1:39:49] attached to every promise that was in
[1:39:52] that book hey baby
[1:39:54] oh
[1:39:56] his benefits
[1:39:58] John thought of that all
[1:40:01] his benefits so it's not so much that it
[1:40:03] gets me excited well this brother's
[1:40:04] trying to work me up well I've seen my
[1:40:06] name revealed so I'm pretty worked up I
[1:40:08] realize that God came to me in this age
[1:40:11] and he's called me by name and he's
[1:40:12] called me out of denomination and he's
[1:40:14] called me out of the fear of the world
[1:40:16] and he set me in a higher place not to
[1:40:18] cast me down but to receive me into his
[1:40:20] kingdom so yes I'm pretty worked up and
[1:40:24] I'm not trying to work you up but I'm
[1:40:25] trying to get you where I'm at come up
[1:40:27] higher John recognize that your name has
[1:40:30] already been written in the last book of
[1:40:32] life before the graffiti ever got there
[1:40:35] before the mistake ever got there before
[1:40:38] the defeat ever got there before the
[1:40:40] depressive Spirit ever attacks your mind
[1:40:41] your name was already there
[1:40:45] it cannot be erased removed you can't
[1:40:48] run from it you can't shake it because
[1:40:50] God thought of you
[1:40:52] you're the expression of the great
[1:40:54] artist
[1:40:54] the artist has expressed his thoughts
[1:40:57] Anna Marie
[1:40:59] and she would come in the end age
[1:41:02] I have a thought
[1:41:04] Samuel
[1:41:05] he would come in the end age
[1:41:08] have a thought Brian
[1:41:09] and he would come
[1:41:11] in the end of age
[1:41:13] now
[1:41:14] who are we
[1:41:16] to go back to the great artists and say
[1:41:18] I don't like the way you made me
[1:41:22] I don't like how you gave me this or you
[1:41:24] made me short or you made me
[1:41:28] white or you made me brown or you made
[1:41:30] me
[1:41:31] how were we to go to complain
[1:41:33] to the great artist
[1:41:36] we're in the picture
[1:41:42] it's pretty good
[1:41:45] we're in the picture
[1:41:47] we have a seat at the table
[1:41:50] who are we to go and complain to the
[1:41:53] great the great king who's invited us to
[1:41:55] this banquet and he spread out
[1:41:57] everything that he owns and he spread
[1:41:58] out this great table further than you
[1:42:00] can see and you're gonna sit down you're
[1:42:01] gonna say well Chick-fil-A is better
[1:42:04] I know Chick-fil-A guys believe that's
[1:42:06] what we'll be eating there
[1:42:08] it'll be better than that
[1:42:10] but who are we to say can you imagine if
[1:42:12] I go to this this
[1:42:14] is just brother what's your name
[1:42:16] Jonathan I go to Jonathan's house
[1:42:17] tonight and we eat dinner and Jonathan's
[1:42:19] out of the kindness of his heart is
[1:42:20] invited me to eat dinner
[1:42:22] and I show up to his house and I say
[1:42:24] well I wish you would have made this
[1:42:28] Jonathan probably wouldn't invite me
[1:42:29] back
[1:42:32] well I really like my potatoes like this
[1:42:36] well Jonathan's probably not invited me
[1:42:37] back wouldn't that be really rude
[1:42:39] wouldn't that be pretty arrogant
[1:42:41] of me to go to his house and expect
[1:42:43] something different than what he's
[1:42:45] provided for me to think that I know
[1:42:47] better than him what I need
[1:42:49] well how arrogant is it of us to go
[1:42:52] complain to God that he made us the way
[1:42:54] he saw us in his mind informed us
[1:42:56] exactly the way he wanted us with the
[1:42:58] inabilities that we have with the
[1:43:00] abilities that we have with the
[1:43:01] complexes that we carry with the Mind
[1:43:03] battles that we fought and I said we say
[1:43:05] we wish you you wouldn't have made us
[1:43:06] like this but God designs you exactly as
[1:43:10] he thought of you in his mind and he
[1:43:12] said I need a perfect little piece
[1:43:14] that'll fit right in there and he
[1:43:16] thought of you and you came into
[1:43:18] existence and there you are the perfect
[1:43:21] picture of what God saw in his mind
[1:43:23] now this picture takes some time if I
[1:43:25] can say it like this I have all these
[1:43:27] quotes but for time's sake the
[1:43:28] photographer takes a picture is there
[1:43:30] any photographers in the room
[1:43:32] no I'm not either okay so this this
[1:43:36] photographer takes a picture
[1:43:38] or Brother Ray
[1:43:44] now we live in the days of instant
[1:43:47] right we see that picture immediately on
[1:43:48] our phone no I don't like it let's take
[1:43:49] another one
[1:43:50] I just can't get it to look good brother
[1:43:51] Ray take another one
[1:43:54] you see we live in the day of instant
[1:43:55] but when the word was written it wasn't
[1:43:57] instant age
[1:44:01] so God took a perfect picture
[1:44:04] of this service
[1:44:05] of you in your struggle
[1:44:08] and your inability and your questions in
[1:44:10] your mind
[1:44:11] and he's taking a picture of this
[1:44:14] but ma'am said before the foundation of
[1:44:15] the world he took a perfect picture
[1:44:18] of you
[1:44:20] now perfect doesn't just go to anything
[1:44:23] perfect only applies
[1:44:25] to when it meets the requirement
[1:44:28] of the artist's mind
[1:44:30] and God takes this perfect picture of
[1:44:32] you
[1:44:34] but it's got to develop
[1:44:37] you know they used to take the picture
[1:44:38] and I don't know if any young people
[1:44:40] probably don't know what I'm talking
[1:44:41] about you know what I'm talking about
[1:44:41] they take a picture in the dark room
[1:44:44] okay so they used to take a picture
[1:44:52] and it would have an image magnetized on
[1:44:54] it
[1:44:55] and they would have to develop it in a
[1:44:57] dark room
[1:44:58] right
[1:44:59] and in that dark room it began to come
[1:45:01] out now the photographer is the only one
[1:45:03] who knows what the picture looks like
[1:45:05] because he's the one who snapped the
[1:45:07] shot and he snapped this picture but it
[1:45:10] takes time to develop the results of
[1:45:13] that picture
[1:45:15] now there's people outside the door
[1:45:16] waiting I want to see my picture I want
[1:45:19] to I want to see my wedding picture back
[1:45:20] in the old black and white days you know
[1:45:22] take a picture be weeks before they
[1:45:23] developed the photo and you'd be
[1:45:25] wondering where's my picture at
[1:45:27] he's developing it in the dark room
[1:45:29] and begins to come in
[1:45:31] it begins to have a little image to it
[1:45:33] because they have a little structure
[1:45:35] around it I can see brother Ray's
[1:45:36] wearing a blue shirt and
[1:45:38] the picture begins to develop
[1:45:41] as I have taken it
[1:45:43] and so you're coming into the
[1:45:45] development
[1:45:46] of the original picture
[1:45:49] of the perfect picture now maybe maybe
[1:45:53] you don't understand what I'm saying
[1:45:54] because the dark room thing
[1:45:56] I didn't take this into account talking
[1:45:59] to people that wouldn't know
[1:46:02] the smartphones how photography works
[1:46:04] you know what I'm talking about okay I
[1:46:06] got one so
[1:46:08] they lay this down in this dark room and
[1:46:11] while this is going on there's no
[1:46:12] seemingly results taking place
[1:46:14] it's just laying in this water
[1:46:17] in times going on and they apply a
[1:46:19] little light and they apply a little
[1:46:20] more dark and they apply a little light
[1:46:21] and they begin to wash it in this water
[1:46:23] and they shake it take it out and hold
[1:46:25] it up to the light yeah it's developing
[1:46:27] nice put it back in the water
[1:46:29] but all this time the photographer knows
[1:46:32] what the picture looks like
[1:46:33] he knows exactly what he has snapped a
[1:46:36] photo of and he's just waiting for it to
[1:46:38] come to manifestation
[1:46:41] God took a perfect picture of you
[1:46:43] before there ever was a trial in your
[1:46:46] life before you ever had a mind battle
[1:46:48] Gideon God took a picture of you of
[1:46:50] exactly what you would look like in
[1:46:52] total Victory and he snapped that
[1:46:54] picture now it takes some time for that
[1:46:56] development to come in and that's this
[1:46:58] age that we're living in and this this
[1:47:00] battles that we're going through it's
[1:47:02] the development of God's perfect picture
[1:47:04] in our life but God has you perfected in
[1:47:08] his mind and that development is coming
[1:47:10] out in this age we are coming to the
[1:47:12] finalization of all things the pictures
[1:47:14] are developed I'm looking at the
[1:47:17] pictures I'm looking at the very sister
[1:47:19] I'm looking at a thought of God I'm
[1:47:21] looking at the mind of God expressed in
[1:47:23] this age that God thought of you so much
[1:47:26] that he spoke you into existence before
[1:47:28] the foundation of the world and he
[1:47:30] called you by name and developed you
[1:47:32] exactly like he saw you in his mind you
[1:47:36] are the thought of God look at your
[1:47:37] neighbor and say I'm an expressed
[1:47:38] thought of God
[1:47:41] I'm an Express thought of God you didn't
[1:47:43] have a neighbor
[1:47:44] Express thought of God
[1:47:47] has never made a mistake
[1:47:55] God has never misplaced a thought now
[1:47:57] you all agreed it committed with me on
[1:47:59] this journey that all of God's thoughts
[1:48:01] are eternal so if you are a thought of
[1:48:04] God and I believe that you are and
[1:48:06] you've got to believe that you are that
[1:48:08] you're the expressed attribute of God
[1:48:10] you will never have an end there will
[1:48:12] never be an end to Jonathan there will
[1:48:15] never be an answer Benjamin why because
[1:48:17] you're a thought of God in the thoughts
[1:48:19] of God can have no end so I say it's
[1:48:22] time to rip off the label of defeat and
[1:48:25] of Despair enough I don't have enough
[1:48:27] faith and I'm confused in this age tear
[1:48:29] that label off tonight young person and
[1:48:31] put what God said about you God said I
[1:48:34] know the thoughts that I dig towards you
[1:48:36] and they are thoughts of peace
[1:48:40] thoughts of Victory thoughts of
[1:48:42] overcoming power thoughts of Holy Ghost
[1:48:44] possession thoughts of overcoming every
[1:48:46] enemy
[1:48:47] anytime anywhere those are the thoughts
[1:48:50] that I think towards you I think it's
[1:48:51] time we wear the label that God put on
[1:48:53] us
[1:48:54] wash it with the blood of the Lamb
[1:48:56] tonight say I'm writing a new name I'm
[1:48:58] writing a new label here I'm writing
[1:49:00] victory over mine
[1:49:02] brother what are you gonna write over
[1:49:03] yours
[1:49:04] Victory right Victory right over right
[1:49:07] over where there was defeat when he came
[1:49:09] in he's riding victory tonight right
[1:49:11] over that word why because God has made
[1:49:13] us free and if he's made us free we are
[1:49:17] free indeed so why would we walk out
[1:49:18] defeated
[1:49:22] why would we walk out now to bring this
[1:49:25] to a close here
[1:49:26] when the artist is done
[1:49:30] he looks back at his work
[1:49:34] I like it
[1:49:36] it's very good
[1:49:39] I like what I've done
[1:49:41] very good work yeah yeah it's the exact
[1:49:44] expression of what I had in my mind
[1:49:48] I imagine that artist he's poured
[1:49:50] himself into that he's poured all that
[1:49:52] he was into that creation
[1:49:56] and he's he's taking the time and just
[1:49:58] look at that tendon we saw and he's he's
[1:50:00] formed that you know how much that must
[1:50:02] have taken to form that
[1:50:05] he looks at this
[1:50:10] how I saw it in my mind
[1:50:12] you know the last thing that artist does
[1:50:16] he signs it
[1:50:20] signs his name to it
[1:50:24] he signs his name right there
[1:50:28] I'm so pleased with what I've created
[1:50:31] I'm gonna sign my name oh I'm gonna sign
[1:50:35] my name right there I'm gonna sign it
[1:50:37] it's my perfect creation
[1:50:40] it's exactly the way that I saw it in my
[1:50:42] mind
[1:50:45] I'm gonna seal it
[1:50:50] I'm gonna put my signature on it
[1:50:53] the God doesn't just sign his name to
[1:50:54] anything
[1:50:56] but he only signs his name to that which
[1:50:58] he is well pleased
[1:51:01] this is my son Zachary I'm well pleased
[1:51:04] I'm gonna sign him
[1:51:08] adoption
[1:51:10] the signing of a name
[1:51:14] this is my son Chase I'm well pleased
[1:51:18] I'm gonna sign him
[1:51:20] and God begins to say it's a finished
[1:51:21] work
[1:51:23] it's finished it's finished
[1:51:25] it's finished the art piece that I see
[1:51:28] in my mind
[1:51:32] I don't think that we should be ashamed
[1:51:36] of how God created us
[1:51:38] Brother Ray
[1:51:40] we shouldn't be ashamed of how God made
[1:51:42] us
[1:51:43] but he was so confident in us that he
[1:51:45] signed his name
[1:51:47] I made you this way Sister Kim I made
[1:51:50] you this way I'm gonna sign my name
[1:51:52] I'm putting my reputation
[1:51:55] on the line
[1:51:57] and you know why he can put his
[1:51:58] reputation on the line because he made
[1:52:00] every part of you
[1:52:02] with Elijah he made you exactly the way
[1:52:04] you are and then he signed and said it's
[1:52:06] sealed delivered go on
[1:52:09] he's not looking back why would we
[1:52:13] man if you come play something
[1:52:16] why would we
[1:52:19] why would we look back at God's creation
[1:52:21] of us
[1:52:22] and think that we can perfect it somehow
[1:52:27] let me just say sisters God Made You
[1:52:29] More Beautiful in his mind
[1:52:32] than Vanity Fair or
[1:52:36] then Sephora could ever imagine
[1:52:39] there's no makeup in the world that
[1:52:41] could improve what God saw in his mind
[1:52:48] God formed you exactly the way he wants
[1:52:51] you you were fearfully and wonderfully
[1:52:53] made with that word fearfully translated
[1:52:55] back to the Greek is beautifully you
[1:52:58] were beautifully and wonderfully made by
[1:53:01] the craftsmanship of God's hand why
[1:53:04] would we try to change
[1:53:06] what God already put his approval on
[1:53:11] young man you don't need to fit in with
[1:53:12] the world
[1:53:14] you don't need to try to fit in with
[1:53:15] your friends at school God made you
[1:53:17] exactly the way you are you cannot
[1:53:19] perfect what God's already perfected
[1:53:22] the only thing you'll do is put graffiti
[1:53:24] over the top of it
[1:53:25] but you know friends some of these older
[1:53:27] brothers didn't hear older sisters can
[1:53:28] testify you can try to perfect what
[1:53:31] God's already created in his mind and
[1:53:33] all you do is you're covering it up
[1:53:35] with graffiti
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:37] let some elders and hear witness tonight
[1:53:40] his blood is able to wash away every bit

[1:53:47] or some woman to give us a complex some

[2:01:57] she knows my Hallelujah
[2:02:01] the signals
[2:02:04] you know God didn't just sign his name
[2:02:07] anywhere but he only signed it where he
[2:02:10] would be confident that it would return
[2:02:12] back to him
[2:02:13] that you would make the right decision
[2:02:15] at the right time in your life he put
[2:02:17] his name there because he knew the
[2:02:19] choice you would make in your life that
[2:02:21] you would run back to him because that's
[2:02:23] where you came from so he signed you and
[2:02:25] he said at the appointed time they'll
[2:02:28] make the right decision for I have
[2:02:30] already chosen them and put my name upon
[2:02:32] the table of their heart so God knows
[2:02:35] where you're at tonight
[2:02:36] he knows exactly where you're at he only
[2:02:38] did that because he had the confidence
[2:02:40] in you
[2:02:42] he put his name on the three Hebrew
[2:02:43] children because he knew they had what
[2:02:46] it took to Not Bow their knee before any
[2:02:49] Idol to Not Bow their knee behind any
[2:02:52] man appointed God they would not bow to
[2:02:55] none other than the word and the word
[2:02:56] itself and he put his name upon them
[2:02:59] brother Shane
[2:03:01] he just cast him out there rotor to say
[2:03:03] hey fend for yourself but they went into
[2:03:05] the hottest place that there ever was
[2:03:06] let me say laodicea is the hottest age
[2:03:09] that there's ever been in this thing
[2:03:12] called time and you're right in the
[2:03:14] middle of it right now
[2:03:15] you're at the hottest part of the
[2:03:17] hottest age
[2:03:18] but God was so confident in you the
[2:03:21] scripture says having all confidence
[2:03:23] so confident in you that he sent you
[2:03:26] here anyway
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:29] think about that sis he sent you here
[2:03:31] anyway
[2:03:32] because he knew the choice you would
[2:03:35] follow him
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:38] he knew that you say I don't care what
[2:03:40] the world thinks I don't care what my
[2:03:42] mom dad think I don't care what my
[2:03:43] brother's sister think I don't care what
[2:03:44] the person next to me thinks I only care
[2:03:46] what God thinks about me
[2:03:48] I only care what Christ has already
[2:03:50] written on the table of my heart
[2:03:54] and you know what happened to them
[2:03:56] [Music]
[2:03:59] the air turned on
[2:04:02] LeBron said there's a man in here that
[2:04:06] can turn on the air and he says that
[2:04:08] same man was there with them children in
[2:04:10] that fire and that air turned on he said
[2:04:12] they didn't feel a wave of heat they
[2:04:14] didn't feel a bit of smoke they didn't
[2:04:16] feel a little bit of Despair they
[2:04:18] weren't anxious they weren't nervous
[2:04:19] they weren't beside themselves because
[2:04:21] they witnessed the Fourth Man in the
[2:04:23] fire with him let me say it doesn't just
[2:04:26] stand for the children of Israel back
[2:04:27] then but that Fourth Man is still here
[2:04:30] in the church today he's still here in
[2:04:32] the middle of the fire and let me say
[2:04:33] what happens when somebody steps on fire
[2:04:36] you ever stepped on a coal of Fire
[2:04:38] you feel it you ever step in a coal of
[2:04:41] fire you feel that under your feet and
[2:04:42] you know that you're standing on
[2:04:43] something you should not be standing on
[2:04:45] but they rejoiced on that coal of fire
[2:04:48] they rejoiced standing there on the
[2:04:50] sacrificial altar because they knew the
[2:04:52] sacrifice had already been met and they
[2:04:55] were already free they were already home
[2:04:58] they were already rejoicing well there's
[2:05:01] a man in here tonight that could turn it
[2:05:03] on David said Thy word is a light up to
[2:05:05] my path in Atlanta to my feet you know
[2:05:08] what that means
[2:05:10] I know where I'm going
[2:05:13] my past lighted friends I'm not despair
[2:05:16] Why Should I Worry why should I be
[2:05:18] despair I have a father he knows my name
[2:05:20] he knows where I've he knows everything
[2:05:22] about me what I thought in my mind what
[2:05:24] I've questioned what I've and you know
[2:05:26] what he sees the blood
[2:05:29] somebody say they
[2:05:31] somebody say we
[2:05:33] we
[2:05:34] overcame the Dragon
[2:05:37] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[2:05:40] Our Testimony let me say that the word
[2:05:42] of Our Testimony is none other than
[2:05:45] overcoming power none other than Holy
[2:05:47] Ghost none other than Grace none other
[2:05:49] than Mercy
[2:05:50] we're not going to make it with anything
[2:05:51] less but we've got to say what he said
[2:05:53] about us I think it's time we lay down
[2:05:56] what mama said about you what Dad said
[2:05:58] about you what the pastor said about you
[2:05:59] what your old Pastor said about you and
[2:06:01] say what God has already said about you
[2:06:05] lay down what you've said about you and
[2:06:08] let God do the speaking for you but the
[2:06:09] blood speaking better things than we
[2:06:12] would speak for ourself
[2:06:14] let the blood do the talking tonight
[2:06:15] Hallelujah
[2:06:18] [Music]

[2:08:31] to him
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:45] but he did not
[2:08:48] despair he started over again
[2:08:56] and our bless the day he is
[2:09:03] away
[2:09:06] and it's over
[2:09:16] to
[2:09:17] [Music]
[2:09:22] fashions
[2:09:32] I am today
[2:09:36] and it's all because Jesus
[2:09:47] sing this last verse if you'd like
[2:09:50] prayer tonight we'd certainly be happy
[2:09:52] to pray with you brother Ronnie would we
[2:09:54] would love love to pray with you I
[2:09:57] believe God is mindful tonight
[2:09:59] God has spoke so perfectly and so
[2:10:02] tenderly and so specifically
[2:10:05] amen
[2:10:07] you know that dark room at one point in
[2:10:09] time I had a privilege
[2:10:11] I took a class in photography back when
[2:10:13] I was in high school and it was an
[2:10:15] actual room you went in and it you could
[2:10:17] not turn on any lights
[2:10:20] matter of fact you know sometimes with
[2:10:23] teenagers we different ones would see so
[2:10:26] and so go in and
[2:10:28] the instructors over there and they'd
[2:10:30] want to kind of come and maybe try to
[2:10:31] open the door and I'll tell you you got
[2:10:33] in trouble because
[2:10:35] the uh the film was expensive
[2:10:41] and it was you know they kind of made it
[2:10:43] old school for us so we had to go
[2:10:45] through and like brother Ronnie said you
[2:10:46] dipped it in this solution you know like
[2:10:49] the buckets that were you or the tubs we
[2:10:51] use for communion foot washing
[2:10:53] young people you know we're talking
[2:10:54] about them for foot washing it's like
[2:10:57] tubs like that but they're a little bit
[2:10:58] shallower you dip it in there take it
[2:11:01] out Bring it dip it over here rinse it
[2:11:04] hold it up then you dip it back in here
[2:11:06] you got to keep doing that
[2:11:08] then eventually you clip it up then you
[2:11:11] got to leave class
[2:11:13] only 50 minutes long
[2:11:15] you come back the next day
[2:11:17] and you trust you're going to see
[2:11:19] something you you can't wait to see a
[2:11:21] woman here's a product
[2:11:24] but it's like how the Lord was bringing
[2:11:25] that through brother Ronnie
[2:11:27] the greatest thing about you and I
[2:11:30] is being able to recognize God in our
[2:11:33] lives
[2:11:35] and to recognize God has something of
[2:11:40] his image that he wants to bring out of
[2:11:42] your life
[2:11:43] and he might have to take it through
[2:11:45] this and he brings it but he's the one
[2:11:47] at work because he already knows what's
[2:11:49] going to come forth
[2:11:52] I know even the young people maybe don't
[2:11:53] remember I thought when brother Ronnie
[2:11:55] was talking about I always think about
[2:11:56] when brother Grant talks about that
[2:11:57] Polaroid I can't hear the picture I was
[2:11:59] thinking about Polaroid and Polaroid was
[2:12:01] like a big thing for us brother

[2:27:07] you realize many times the things
[2:27:09] sometimes we wonder why thoughts come
[2:27:11] thoughts are spirits
[2:27:13] and things that we have to evaluate is
[2:27:16] is even after you come out of a meeting
[2:27:18] like this there's things that you you
[2:27:20] need to put right away and say Lord
[2:27:24] there's things that I don't want to give
[2:27:25] any more time to
[2:27:28] that would hinder you're working in my
[2:27:31] life
[2:27:32] I don't want to open myself up to
[2:27:34] anything else I want to open myself to
[2:27:36] you God you've come and spoke to me
[2:27:39] tonight he's the one that's dismissed
[2:27:41] right here tonight he's dismissed
[2:27:43] thoughts and he's given you the
[2:27:46] authority to dismiss those thoughts of
[2:27:49] what you think about yourself you can
[2:27:51] say well I know the person I see in the
[2:27:53] mirror but God knows as was spoke
[2:27:56] tonight what's in you he knows what he
[2:27:59] put in you and the authority of his word
[2:28:02] his living presence has given you a
[2:28:05] confidence tonight to be able to put
[2:28:08] that behind you
[2:28:10] now at this moment apply that word
[2:28:13] apply the blood
[2:28:15] even as you go forth out of this this
[2:28:17] service in this meeting
[2:28:19] just keep walking on with the Lord
[2:28:22] go forward
[2:28:24] you know there's no sound of retreat
[2:28:27] you keep going forward
[2:28:30] I think tonight there's things if
[2:28:31] there's a service to come back to I God
[2:28:34] put it to me and I don't to me it's
[2:28:38] profound to me when I say things are
[2:28:40] simple it's because God made them simple
[2:28:43] it that this is this is a great big
[2:28:46] thought but God has come down and God
[2:28:48] has made this simple tonight to where
[2:28:51] that we can you can take this with you
[2:28:52] and if there's one thing brother Ronnie
[2:28:54] said there's a scripture we are to have
[2:28:56] on your uh refrigerator that's where I
[2:28:59] go a lot on the mirror or wherever you
[2:29:02] go Psalms 139 I know the thoughts I
[2:29:06] think
[2:29:07] concerning you maybe you need to write
[2:29:09] that on the back of your phone
[2:29:12] maybe you need to you know don't don't
[2:29:15] cover up your rearview mirror but maybe
[2:29:16] you need to put the little bit of Peace
[2:29:18] on that on that part of it right there
[2:29:20] maybe you need to put it on where the
[2:29:21] blind spots are at on your car
[2:29:23] I know the thoughts
[2:29:25] that I think concerning you
[2:29:27] thoughts of peace
[2:29:30] that bring you to an expected end
[2:29:33] oh my I tell you
[2:29:37] it's a living God right Among Us that's
[2:29:39] bringing certainty in our lives in an
[2:29:42] hour of uncertainty it's his presence
[2:29:44] coming that brings certainty don't you
[2:29:47] love him
[2:29:48] amen how many you can say right here
[2:29:51] Lord I'm more determined I'm more
[2:29:54] determined God help me give me Lord let
[2:29:57] me have the patience as it's developing
[2:29:59] everything in my life
[2:30:01] God's got it all
[2:30:04] you know it's just like many times like
[2:30:06] that seed that God put in you it's like
[2:30:09] a suitcase
[2:30:12] when you get somewhere every one of us
[2:30:13] have been somewhere you've been at youth
[2:30:15] camps or whatever more and you have to
[2:30:16] pack up to go home
[2:30:18] and you got to make sure you take all
[2:30:20] your clothes home because mom's gonna be
[2:30:22] asking about them but you wonder how did
[2:30:25] Mom pack this suitcase how
[2:30:29] it's in there
[2:30:30] that's the same way in your life
[2:30:32] God has everything
[2:30:34] done to that seed
[2:30:36] and God begins to unzip that and he
[2:30:38] begins to take things out of your life
[2:30:40] and don't worry he has an outfit for
[2:30:43] every occasion God has every thing just
[2:30:47] in its right season
[2:30:49] just let him unfold him
[2:30:51] let him unpack it
[2:30:53] his grace is sufficient don't you love
[2:30:56] him
[2:30:57] I just want I want to keep looking at
[2:30:58] the picture I want to as I'm staring at
[2:31:00] the picture you say what's the picture
[2:31:02] it's the message of the hour and as I'm
[2:31:05] looking at that I start looking at it
[2:31:07] I'm seeing me
[2:31:09] I'm seeing me more clearly
[2:31:12] I'm seeing me oh my more clearly more
[2:31:15] clearly
[2:31:17] so when a thought comes and you put on a
[2:31:19] message and you feel like I didn't get
[2:31:20] nothing that's not true
[2:31:23] because God's word is taking effect upon
[2:31:25] your life
[2:31:27] as you just give yourself to the Lord
[2:31:29] God develops his thoughts
[2:31:33] in your life
