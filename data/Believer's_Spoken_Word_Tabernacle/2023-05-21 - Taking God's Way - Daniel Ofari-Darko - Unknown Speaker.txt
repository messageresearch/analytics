no matter what tomorrow brings what it has a story I know that I I'm gonna wartime amen I will praise him I I'm gonna praise my Lord yes I will I will gonna praise my Lord foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord amen is that how you feel amen sometimes that's not how I feel sometimes that's not how I feel but that's the resolution in my heart regardless of how I feel I'm going to praise the Lord you know sometimes it takes on a whole new meaning when it says offer to the Lord a sacrifice of praise sometimes it's not hard to offer up praise to the Lord but at some of the times when it it seems lean or it seems like nothing's happening or all things all around can be very discouraging but that's the time to praise him so many examples in the scriptures that we we draw from in that time David he encouraged himself in the word of the Lord you know it wasn't just the enemies that was around David and what the Philistines had done but the OWN the men that were around David had become discouraged and they were ready to Stone him it's one thing for your enemies but it's another thing when you have those that are close around you but David did what a Seed of Abraham will do and he reached in the script bag of God's word and he began to encourage himself in the things of God and I believe that's why we're here this morning we're here to receive from God that we might encourage ourselves in the things of God so what a what a privilege it is a man to come together what what what things can happen here this morning amen I'm going to ask you to be seated but before you do would you turn around and shake hands with someone and just welcome them to the house of the Lord say it's good to see you amen it's so good to see each and every one and we've um it certainly feels good I know for my wife and myself it feels good to feel good and um some of you you many are not aware of it but not this past week but the week before last my wife I think she loved me so much she decided to share some of her kidney stones with me and so not this past Monday but the Monday before early in the morning of three or whatever woke up and so um they took me to the emergency room and I guess I got to experience everything I've had to stand there and watch you know from her but uh God was good and I appreciate the nurses and the different ones that attended and the pain I subsided and things just continued to move and now it brings in my mind a whole new thought I think oh Lord when I'm traveling overseas so you know I've got said oh my you know it's uh something you know you start feeling a little bit of a twinge or something like that but um I thank God for his mercy and God is so good he's so good to us and you know sometimes how God will allow us to come through experiences and it just makes us even more compassionate and more understanding and greater sympathy amen for others when they are going through things you know how it is when you're dealing with pain or sickness sometimes it's what's so hard for me is it seems like I don't even remember what it feels like to feel good and it could just be even you know sickness we came through in this past weekend and it's so foreign do you think how does that feel to feel good and yet you were feeling good however many days out of the year but I'm grateful for the grace of God Amen and through it all God is truly our comfort so we just certainly are so thankful for that I want to just say I was so uh so so um thankful when I heard the report on sister Anna I know my wife had shared that with me and I know we had been praying about those things even before that test and so I was just so thankful the other day and that was a great relief to my heart and when she came and told me the other day and so we're just so thankful to the Lord amen for his Mercy amen and we just just asked God to continue to guide every part of that and we want to say uh brother Vivian had text me here the other day and brother Vivian had he's graduated um this is the 15th master's degree I'm just teasing him brother Vivian is a very diligent very diligent uh brother a very diligent man very diligent student and a lot of those things that even he and brother Constantine that even his their sister sister Judith and uh so we just uh we're thankful for that and we just are grateful for God's grace seeing you through brother Vivian amen may God just continue to guide you and he knows I'm just teasing with him but he has more you have multiple degrees don't you yeah he does you never know when you're gonna you know you never know when each one will come in in handy so we just we thank God for that um you know Paul knew multiple languages some things come in handy for certain times so uh also there's a card out there for uh for brother Tommy uh for those of you my father-in-law that you would sign that and everything that we've had going on even from this past week uh the last time I actually seen my father-in-law was last Saturday because I didn't want to get around him with the sickness and things that we've had and and so forth and um but um it's Jeff something I'm so glad that God has uh brought him home safely and he's doing he's doing well and you get a chance to call him or text him and that would be a great blessing amen you know brother Brandon said it like this in the message and um he said you know sometimes he said you don't realize how important that is for someone to come and see you or or to send something and he says this he said but when it when our mother my mother was going through it he said then he says when I seen the others coming and sending you know they didn't send texts but a phone call he said man you realize just how much that means to you during that and we're a body aren't we I said we're a body aren't we amen and soul you know it's it's it's kind of like you know waiting around to see well who's going to clean up well just glad let's let's grab the bloom broom and let's start and see if others are going to join us amen let's not wait for somebody to start it let's just be the the little twig that gets it going amen so I want to remind you that this coming weekend that's what I wanted to just take a few minutes here in this in the moment before we bring brother Daniel out this coming weekend we have our annual uh Memorial Day Services coming up and um I'm just thankful that God has provided for that and provided for us to be able to host that and you know the objective that everything that we we have even when we have special meetings it's for a special time it's for a special moment it's a time that we're able to step aside and you know when Moses first went with deliverance and with that message his request was is a three-day meeting in the wilderness and they said no we're not going to let you do that and remember then from that point then here's where all the plagues and everything started coming but the first request is let us have a three-day journey in the wilderness that we may go and worship God to separate from the labors from the regular routines of Life how many know that we get into regular routines yeah you know even in church you get into your regular seat you get into your regular parking place you your regular songs everything becomes regular and what happens is it becomes common and that's where the battle that we have to we see that weakness about us within humans and that we have to battle through that and so God gives us an opportunities in times like this that we might be refreshed in the presence of the Lord and I'll tell you if there ever was a time that the people of God need to be refreshed need to be strengthened need to be encouraged every time as the prophet said that we need a juniper tree it's right now a place to be refreshed Amen in his presence and I'm I'm thankful that God has provided that for us and I know with brother Nathan Bryant brother Nathan I have become good friends here over the past years and I know that with the ministry you will you will definitely we will be blessed and um I just am so looking forward to that for that time I want to just I I looked out there and I seen on the menu and I've seen where it looks like now there's only a few blanks that are left on there and man was I encouraged to see that uh because you know it takes so it takes a body to put everything on when you when you something like this and you have to have all the efforts and all hands on board to do it but there's a reason that it's it's worth it I know it's a labor but it's a labor for all and and we but there's a cause and there's a purpose and just to think that within it's all said and done the laboring that has been done within it what a blessing that waits in store for you and I uh what a blessing it is to be able to serve what a blessing it is to be able to give and you think back to that little woman who cleans she I don't think she had any help at all she cleaned that whole horse star like we said last Sunday she did it she did it all and had a service and here one man who came to the Lord Dwight Moody she got a burden on her heart I say oh God may may we have a burden and just operate in it don't just let God bring it and bring make the way open for you you know and sometimes I know we have a burden and it's kind of looking at Lord how do I fulfill this or express it and you know if there's something you have in your heart talk to me about it or talk to us about it we'll make sure if God's put a burden on your heart then we certainly want to work within that channel so the in the menu out there there are items that can be brought for the the picnic uh the only app the only thing that I didn't see out there on the blink was appetite some of you will get that tomorrow I didn't see anything out there that says your hunger or your appetite or you know but that's still we understand that there's things so I would like you to look with look at that as you even are dismissed here because there are some things that are still needed there are multiple blinks I that are out there I said a couple of blanks but I did see some on the other um a paper where there's still some things with drinks and other things like that so please make your way by there and and just whatever can be done uh sister Amanda will be having a meeting here right after the service today in the back room just to the finishing touches and preparation so please make yourself available for that for the Sisters to fine tune that and make sure that we're all on board you know that we're having the fellowship dinner at the Mill Hollow reservation shelter number one so um it kind of was the elected to do that and because the Presbyterian Church we did have that rent but at the time it was not known whether they were going to have their air conditioning fixed or not so they had just been able recently to do that but there's also the part with the Presbyterian Church it works nice in the winter time to preserve us from the elements but the difficult time difficult in these moments is when the kids want to go and play and there's such a busyness that's through there and as kids kids want to go and play you know when we had church fellowships when I was younger I that's all I thought about sometimes I didn't even eat I know it didn't look like it but it was true I went there to play football and volleyball and have a good time and so kids want to play and so we I you know there was there's such a business there sometimes and we have to watch that and so that was where it was elected to have it there at Mill Hollow at shelter number one so you might want to bring lawn chairs if you would like to have some other comfortable seating to set in and one other announcement that I wanted to and something to put before you is that you know last year in the fall and I had a burden on my heart for some time to begin having things here at the church fire pit and having things here we have the facilities we have the use we have the things and the parking is set up and everything is to be used as a facility and so and uh that's something that I would looking at with the weather permitting and it looks very promising is that we would be able to have a possible fire pit Fellowship on that Sunday evening and uh is everybody still with me so uh brother Shane he's done a fantastic job with with this in the past of uh from the very on start of on on part of it when I had conveyed just the burden and the vision he took it and went with it and to get all that set up um but this year he and sister Lily had some deliberating on a wedding that they had to go to and so he's not going to be able to to be here but we just need I'm asking for a volunteer of volunteers that would be able to set up the fire pit and get the firewood and we can help with that but we are definitely going to need some help to get that set up and I know there's some things with some of the dirt and we can kind of get that crowd off and things but I really want to use the facility if we're going to do it I want to use the facility here to do that with because of the parking and everything that we have and so if someone would be willing to do that please see me that would be a great blessing the reason is we've got families there will be families that will be coming in I don't even know the amount that's coming in I know that there's been a lot of response immediately when we everything was posted with the meetings and sent out but I think it would be a great blessing and opportunity for fellowship and testimonies and worship because God is doing and he's going to do great things if there's one thing in this comings in this coming week I just ask you to really be in prayer and just be into under come under a place of expectation because no matter what the need is God is more than enough if it's healing God Is A Healer if it's Deliverance God is a deliverer and so we just want to be under a real expectation and really being in prayer for the services for what God is going to do because I believe there are pointed moments there are pointed times for us and we don't know how many more times that we have like this but we want to make the most of it being in prayer for it how many knows that prayer the prayer it availeth much amen and when God's people begin to pray and begin to call on God there are needs all around us but I'd just say if there's one prayer that we could all have as a resounding prayer is God may you move in a very special way and pour out of your spirit Lord every single need I think it's we can ask for every single need and say God that you would meet every single need I think that's part of standing in this hour and not being ashamed of the word that's come amen when brother Brown preached that message of being ashamed in 1965 he comes to the end of it he says I find he says I think even in myself he said you find where you're almost asking the devil to leave and apologizing to him he said we should not be that way we adjure him to leave in the name of Jesus Christ as Sons and Daughters of God that's being unashamed of the authority of the word in this hour amen we have an authority in Jesus Christ may not look like much but remember it's not the size of the policeman that badge says all of City Hall is behind him and there's a badge of believer the token of the Holy Ghost that when we stand on God's word then all of Heaven is behind the word of God Amen so we just love the Lord and I just ask once again that if anyone would be willing to do that and to set up that with the fire pit and the firewood and getting those things arranged would you please see me whether it after service here today or at some point that would be a great great help because I know even with the the volleyball setup and and so forth for and activities to be done out here and we just want we want to be a blessing is that right I want to be a blessing when God told Abraham he said not only will you be blessed but you will be a blessing and so we want to be a blessing amen and I just I love I love the people of God and we're just so grateful to be together I ask you to forgive me for these few moments of time but I had to had to take him and uh we want to just invite brother Daniel to come and minister in my what a what a wonderful service on Thursday evening God ministered such words of comfort and strength to our hearts and our lives that the angel of the Lord is encamped around about those that fear Him and love him and do you realize that as brother Daniel makes his way forward do you realize that brother Ram said that Elisha when he prayed that way for God to open up the eyes of gehaza it wasn't that Elisha even saw the Angels brother brem said Elisha had seen that God had said it in his word and it was enough for Elijah that's where we stand as the Seed of Abraham once we've met God taste the Lord and see his good then everything that he said I don't need to see it I know that he's God and he will provide and he backs up everything that he's ever said you believe that this morning amen could we rise to our feet and maybe one more time I know brother Daniel's got some presentation here but maybe it'll kind of break a little bit um but let's just say um let's sing the song I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I need you Lord I need you Lord right now [Music] yes I need you Lord I need you Lord right now yeah I lift my hands about my knees [Music] I need a new Lord right now [Music] oh I need you alone I need you oh right now [Music] I need [Music] I need I need you to lie now lift my hands about my knees [Music] about your Dawn [Music] I need now [Music] how many of you are happy to be in the presence of the Lord let's give a clap offering to the Lord Jesus you know when We Gather like this then we put confusion into the camp of the enemy Avail yourself this morning let's worship God amen God bless all of us let's sit for a moment okay well I am happy to be with you again this morning and before we go into the word of the Lord the Lord I've certainly done so much so many things in our lives and sometimes we have to get time to testify to glorify his holy name amen I remember back home in a church there were so many challenges and I don't say the word there is because it goes on you know and uh notable one was our place of worship we've been moving from one place to another one school to another until now is not even permitted for you to go and get in a school to worship God and so we ended up looking for a property to kind of put up a building and you know it's not easy also because where we are in the country we are in a city and everything is so much High so I contacted my precious brother Samuel and I told him that brother this is our situation have already you know help out but I need your help we have to secure a land whether we like it or not and to my surprise but as someone did not hesitate at all hey zebra Daniel we are going to help you so swiftly then it came to our age and I know that it is you brethren who made it possible so I am here this morning to show my greatest appreciation to brother Samuel and all of you in this church that we so much appreciate your love your care your support and it make us feel that we are not alone because God bless you and uh just uh church God bless you oh I say God bless you yes when I say God bless you I expect to hear your response amen the amen is a stump a seal Let It Be so God bless you that's it amen you are not home so yes uh this is the property now the Lord by God's grace and the help of you brilliant we've been able to ah aqua everything is subtle everything is set that we are going to crack the ground and that day I don't know how I'll be jumping because almost 27 years now will be moving from one place to another one place to another one place to another um the unfortunate thing is that like I told you the city that we are in is uh more or less our industrial city so everything is very very expensive it's not easy to get land so there's a miracle that God rotted in our lives so that is it we've already hired a machine to clear the land clear the land and uh everything is prepared yeah and uh I hope you have to Rejoice for what you have done Hallelujah so yeah these are all okay you can play this a little for them to hear the machine working yes we started declaring our land real life awesome way [Music] work has started wake up started what are the devil like it or not [Music] yeah this is how we expect the ground today very level for the project for the project you can go to the other pictures brother brother Brian I hope I've not broken anymore over there then there is another pillar out there so some of this what you have helped us to do so much appreciate your

Christ's name we pray amen beloved we are reading Joshua chapter 1. and verse 8-9 Joshua chapter 1. verse 8 and 9. and we'll read First Corinthians also chapter 2. Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt then for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good sources have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with us forever thou goeth First Corinthians chapter 2 . First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 16. for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of his word amen let's take our seats breathing and this morning if God will we are going to speak on a topic taking God's way so that means it's not your way the way of man is always not good by the way of the Lord is good I remember one time when Jesus Christ started to move from the second Ministry to the third Ministry which always separate the unbeliever from the believer he asked them he told them in fact time is coming you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood and the Bible says that when Jesus made that statement some of the disciples left they weren't one by one after they performed the Miracles right after they were witnesses to the Miracles that Christ performed after God Jesus blessed you know the food the bread the Tulips or Five Loaves and two fishes they enjoyed they took part of it um but when he started to preach something deeper they really know we cannot contain this so they left him and Jesus turn around and was only left with a 12. and he asked them a question will you also go will you desert me Jesus look at him and he said Lord to whom should we go where you are the only one that have the words of eternal life so in other words Peter that day was telling Jesus we cannot take our own way but we will go your way Hallelujah you take the way by inspiration and by revelation it is not anybody advice but your own choosing amen you know the prophet preaches someone and he said choosing a bride it's just like that nobody to see you choose it right if you choose and you choose good praise God if you choose and you don't choose good praise God you cannot blame anyone so Peter said that day Lord to whom should we go you are the one that have eternal life the prophet said your Footprints means your possession your Footprints where you put your food is your possession but how do you take it do you go your own way or you go God's way that is the question that we are going to answer this morning beloved brothers and sisters amen how do you take it that is why God told Joshua let's go back to Joshua he knew that if you choose his way it's full of blessing but you if you go your own way it's causes so he told Joshua after the death of Moses he said now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of none Moses ministers saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan da and all these people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your food shall tread upon that have I given you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even onto the Great River the river Euphrates or the land of the heat eyes and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto these people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be down strong and very courageous the thou Mayors observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee 10 not from it to the right hand or to the left thou mayest Prosper with a server thou do it verse 8 this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate during day and night the Thousand Years observed to do according to all not some oh that is written therein for them Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good sources it's a promise direct from God how not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is within without server thou goeth Hallelujah God desired that Joshua should lead his people after the death of Moses but God didn't make Joshua to go by his own choice God chose the way amen and that has been in the life of everyone God chose the way and he expects you to pass on that way by forgetting what you think is reasonable forgetting things that you think that is the good one you need to forget that and come God's way Hallelujah he said when you do that then you will be prosperous in your ways you cannot bless yourself it's God that blesses amen now let's equate this with Deuteronomy chapter 11 quickly Deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 13. and it shall come to pass if yes diligently unto my commandment which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul that I will give you the reign of your land in his new season the first Reign and the latter rain the Thousand Years Gather in thy come and then wine and thy oil and I will send grass in thy fields for thy cuttle now thou mayest eat and be full what a Blessed assurance take it to yourself that your heart be not deceived and yet turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the Lost Rod be Kendall against you and he shut up the heaven that there will be no rain and that the land yield not a fruit unless you perish quickly from of the good land which the lord giveth you therefore shall ye lay up this my words in your hearts and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they that day may be as faultless between your eyes it may be a headlights between your eyes to keep you and to guide you amen now verse 19 he said and yeah you shall teach them your children um and Yea shall teach them your children yay you we the church must teach the children Hallelujah it is our responsibility by the command of God by the word of God that we teach our children Hallelujah we go to some places they say children's right we go to some places they send human rights human rights we don't have children's rights we don't have human rights we have God's right amen will we allow the world to decide for us are we going to allow the world to teach us or tell us what we should do to our children Hallelujah God said we should meditate upon it day and night and teach our children so who will tell me not to teach my child brother we are not here to please the world that is what we Believers must know we cannot please the world no matter what we cannot please the world if we want to please the world then we must be unbelievers ourselves if we deny the word then we can please the world the word of God and the world has nothing in common Hallelujah The Wonder of God has this course and the world also has its course the Bible said we should teach our children and we'll continue to teach them because we want them to go God's way amen and amen it says speak of them one thou seated in thy house don't just sit down and be be having some not always that you have to teach your children how many of us teach our children sometimes we feel that oh we should allow the children and they have can make their own decision no brother sister let me tell you a fact there are so many people there are so many children who have been born into this message but they make their own personal revelation you don't sit down and say that oh that is my son that is my daughter automatically she's coming to be a no no let me tell you the devil has been an old player of the game the devil know how to play the game Hallelujah don't just relax and say that oh they are born in the message they are baptizing the law so that is enough they need their own personal revelation how would you get it the Bible said teach them when you sit in your home teach them when you walk on the way teach them when you ride in the car with them teach them Hallelujah when you go to the restaurant teach them any place that you are teaching the children amen I don't want anybody I don't want to hit that children's right yesterday I was with brother Willian he was telling me so funny things and dangerous things that today people go into the schools and go and teach their children horrible things so what do you think is going to happen to these children if we sit down as mothers and fathers and as a church without teaching them what they're supposed to know what is going to happen to them yeah yeah beloved whether you believe it or not Heaven is coming down Heaven has already come down Hallelujah the prophet said that as much as the demons have been loosed upon they said he said Heaven is also lose upon this Earth so if they have been influence we are also being influenced amen and amen oh beloved brothers and sisters he said and now verse 20 endowed now let me finish with the verse 19. and when that worketh by the way went down lies down and when thou arises up and thou shall write them upon the doorpost of thine house remember they took him amen it's a demonstration you must demonstrate it amen and upon thy Gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them are the days of Heaven upon the Earth as the days of Heaven upon the Earth for if ye shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and to Cliff unto him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and yes shall possess greater nation and martier than thou every place wherefore the soul of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the rivers even onto the ottom of sea shall your Coast be there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he has said unto you behold I sat before you this day a blessing and a case a blessing if ye obey the Commandment of the Lord your God is going to be a blessing which I command you this day and a curse if ye will not obey the Commandments of the Lord your God but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which he have not known which one are you taking or which one have you already taken the way of the Lord or the way of the world it came to a Time when Madame Naomi after he left Bethlehem because of hardship because of situation that was not favorable accepting the husband they found themselves in the land of Moab with their two sons ballon and children and the Bible says that this boy or this young man got themselves more British women and they married them but it will not play along Naomi lost the husband and the two sons who's supposed to have you know console her also died and the woman realized that no things has not gone well with me how can things go well with you when you leave the land of God you trust your own way they chose their own way so how will that be good with you man so Shake Yourself one day said no I have to go back I have to go back and serve my God no matter what because I came full and now I'm going back empty so this woman called the two daughters-in-law and told them ladies I am going back to my country because the Lord have dealt bitterly with me here allow me now go to your people and go and stay with them I release you perhaps you are no longer under any bondage go and make your life to women they had the same thing from the mouth of Naomi the Bible says oppa both of them cried of course when the woman was pouring out such a you know disheartening you know information to them because they love them they love her whatever you can take it but all of a sudden telling them that they should live there because she was going back to a place it sat in their heart and all of them cried but Ruth I'm sorry oppa the other woman with the prophet said that she represented the denomination she reached to Naomi and kiss her and went back home so what was the meaning of that kiss not there are there are pieces that are very dangerous you know that so when somebody is going to kiss you be bold and ask the person which type of Kiss is this is the kiss that is going to bring me blessing happiness or joy or a case of betrayer be bold and ask the person because somebody kissed Jesus Christ and he was killed Hallelujah so not all the kisses are only peace some are dangerous some are betrayal some are hypocrisy yes very good oppa please Naomi and she went back to worship kamash the idol but look at Ruth she said madam and treat me not to return from following thee for where you go I will go your people shall be my people your God shall be my God why you sleep there I will sleep when you die there I will die while you are buried there I'll be buried oh realize that if Naomi is going back to Bethlehem then she was going to the god of the Israelites so why don't I go with her that I may affiliate myself with the people of God I will not choose my way I will choose the way of the Lord and when nagami realized I know she couldn't compel Ruth to return she allowed her to follow her now when that went to the land and they saw Naomi and everybody was cheering her up you know that thing that he said he said don't call me Naomi call me Mara because the Lord have dealt bitterly with me God didn't deal bitterly with you it was your own choosing it was your own choosing but thank God that you have come back home hallelujah thank God that you have come back home now you are going to see the glory of God there was nothing for them to eat so one morning routul I'm sorry Naomi told Ruth Ruth why don't you go and look for a place that you can clean something and bring it home and Roots set off because rude have already taken God's way from the beginning God didn't live here God didn't leave her any step from that day God wrote to take it was God's Own Way yes there were so many fields that were that way you know Glenn they were harvesting but why didn't Root find herself in any of those lands but she found herself on the portion of the Christmas Redeemer [Applause] why why because she chose God's will let's open to rule chapter 2. after he went she went and she was you know glinning now listen to what transpired but was came on the land came to the to the place and found this young woman verse 8 he said then said Boaz unto Ruth no let me take it from uh from uh verse four okay and Boaz and because came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord blessed you then said by us unto his servant that was set over the Reapers who danced there is this when he saw Ruth my mind and a servant that was set over the Reaper's answered and said it is the more British themselves that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab and he said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the ships so she came and had continued even from the morning until now that she carried a little in the house then said but was unto Ruth yellow thou not my daughter go not to Glenn in another field all right yes another go from hands but abide here fast by my meetings let thy eyes be on the field that they do reap and go down after them have I not judged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou at a test go unto the vessel and drink of that which the young men have drawn Hallelujah then she fell on her face and bow herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thy eyes that thou should take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger why have thy how why have I found Grace in thy sight yes Ruth is asking all of us this question this morning why have I found Grace in thy sight can somebody give answer to Ruth this moment yes Ruth you have found favor in the face of the king's My Redeemer because you didn't go your own way but you went God's way that's why you'll find favor Hallelujah amen and Boaz answered and said unto her it had fully been showed me all that thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband and how that has left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and I come unto a people without knoweth not here to fall the Lord the Lord recompense thy Work and the full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel and the whose wings Thou Art come to trust amen there she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for that thou has comforted me and for that thou has spoken friendly unto thy handmaid though I be not like unto one of thy handmaids and was said unto her at Meal Time come down hither and eat of the bread who what a favor spiritual food induces them is prepared for special people not all the people Boaz will not invite anybody to come to that barn and come and eat but look at what God did to Ruth because this woman chose the way of the Lord amen and when she was risen up to glean but was commanded his young man saying let her glean even among the ships at the beginning she was just following the Reapers so that the ones that have been left are they gather but now the instruction has come from the man himself Authority this Authority note has come from himself he said let her glin even among the ships and reproach her not and not for also some of the handful of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not oh what a favor now root is not just only going to harvest or Glenn among the workers but for her sake instruction has gone forth they should deliberately leave the food behind them oh Hallelujah deliberately they should leave the food behind them so that rude can reach them [Music] God's favor God's favor God's favor when you take God's way brothers and sisters there are abundance of blessings for you he promised Joshua he said walk in the way of my seven Moses and thou shall be prosperous and now it is up to you and I if we can walk that same way that's important of blessing awaits us let's take God's way amen and not the long story short we all know what happened when uh route went back home and broke this news to Naomi Naomi was so much excited and Naomi knew that something was fixing to happen Hallelujah if God opened one door million malls are open in that same door other lawyer if you tell God's way and the door is open onto you I say mean your mom are up in that same door so one day when uh Naomi heard that Boaz was going to you know we know his Bali or whatever they call it in those days then you call Ruth so now Naomi has become the prophetess of Ruth because she repented and went back to take her position in the house of God she remained the daughter of God no matter what what happened and she found herself in a string land she has come back so now she was instructing Ruth amen remember root on confession said where you go I will go so then there's three chapter three he said then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her this one my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now it's not Boaz of our kindred with whose meetings that was behold he winnowed Bali tonight in the trash and floor wash thyself wash thyself and anoint thee and put Direction upon thee and get thee down to the floor oh beloved beloved this is the hardest time God is harvesting Hallelujah in all the ages God has harvesting true and we have been bid to wash ourselves we've washed ourselves from the unbelief of this world [Music] we've washed ourselves from the doubt of this world we wash ourselves from the crookedness of this world and we have anointed ourselves with the Holy Spirit and we are set to mean the king's man amen he said but make not thyself known unto the mind until he shall have done eating and drinking Hallelujah and it shall be when he lied down that thou shall make the place that's a mark the place where he shall lie and thou shall go in and uncover his feet and let me down and you will tell thee what thou shall do The Story Goes On and goes on and goes on and what happened was that after Boaz have done all this ceremony and he has got someone into his body oh brother and it is simulated him at night he went and lay but according to the instructions of Naomi he said when you see that go and uncover his skirt and lay beneath her foot and she would tell you what you will do so when Boaz went and lay Ruth did exactly the instruction from Naomi the Bible said that at midnight then was better and realize that somebody was lying you know beneath it he said who are you then Ruth will look at him say you are the kiss man you are the near Kingsman cover me with your skirt oh Hallelujah cover me with your skirt root got the power to demand freedom she got the power to demand happiness she got the power to demand her Liberty because they needed a Kingsman Redeemer and he said the near Kingsman comfort me with your skirt and Naomi said that he will tell you what you will do and when Ruth made that statement but was understood and the one said well there is another man who is the the most nearer case man before myself so I will you know talk with him if he agreed to do the necessary thing then praise God but if he refused I oh Hallelujah I will do it and you know the story the first man refused because he said he cannot redeem Naomi and marry Ruth because Ruth was was a gentile the man didn't know his responsibility even though he was from the tribe of Judah he didn't know that the Judas they marry from the Gentile world Judah himself married a gentile salmon marry a gentile is that not it who again Boaz was going to marry a gentile David marry a gentile and Jesus Christ himself has marry a joint a woman so that man didn't have the capability to do the necessary thing was said don't worry I would do it and that same anointing That Came Upon rude that day to demand the world cover me with your scared in the same anointing that has come upon us Once Upon a Time we didn't know our left and right and that was a time when George saw the book still with Seven Seals in the right hand of he that sat upon the throne he didn't have any strength he didn't know anything about that but he realized that there was something in that book for him but what Authority did he have and started crying crying until he said he heard the voice calling him John stop crying for the lion of the tribe of Judah again Hallelujah has prevailed to unfold those seals and when he tells you look he saw a lamb full of blood um approaching the throne and he approached the throne and sees the book and open the first deal the second the third the fourth the fifth the fifth the seventh amen remember Boaz raised the script and he found a woman there and the woman said that cover me with the skirt I have to be under your control I have to be in your home come on me with your skirt Hallelujah and when the series were open the blood of Jesus Christ we also went to the throne and now we commanded give me the book Hallelujah we have the power now to say give me the book cover me with your sketch oh praise be the name of our God because the woman chose God's way even though it was hot they didn't have anything but she choices anyhow remember the ministry of the prophet when that man is it Danny Henry that spoke in the tongues in the French language right and there were so much three interpreters into the same thing and concerning the ministry of the prophet he said because that have chosen the the narrow part the other way thou have chosen on your own way and that is my way and because of momentous and precise decision you have taken a huge listen to the adjectives a huge portion of Heaven awaits you amen amen brother sister I said that into your life this morning because you have chosen the way of the Lord a huge portion of Heaven is awaiting you too [Music] and he said that in itself is that which make Hallelujah and will come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine cover me with your skirt give me the book Hallelujah now listen to something from Jehovah Jireh please I said tell the time not to run he said well now okay he said now we we now he said well now God just didn't go over there and take broom and swept out Canaan and all the amorites and the hitters and not them and send them out and said come on Israel this is yours they've even planted the crops for you no no sir they had to fight every inch of the way that is right but they had the promise of victory God told Joshua it wasn't easy God didn't take broom and saw the the what do we call it the enemies and the those unbelievers and asked Israel to go and take no they went to fight right all right rude people just got up and I mean Rich Bethlehem as your prospered no I know remember the prophet told us of the four stages of Ruth deciding root seven root rewarding or what no there's another one before rewarding something like that what God bless you and root rewarding four stages and every child of God if you want to choose God's way you go through that four stages Hallelujah amen he said they had to fight every inch of the way that is right but they had the promise of Victory God told Joshua wherever the soul of your food tread that I have given to you so Footprints meant possession yes amen now let's continue when Boaz realized that he has finished the connection or the agreement with the Ruth it's a Ruth before you go open your Veil and he gave her six measures of Bali six measures of Bali and when I check it it was almost 50 pounds that can take them enough days but the question is why would he give the woman six measures and not five and four come on brother the number six the number six is always a number of a man and we know who that man is and the number seven is always a mystery Hallelujah so if you want to know the seventh measure of the valley it was Boaz himself measure amen and you know what he said and she led it at his feet oh is that the place no he said and so and he said bring the veil that thou art upon thee and hold it and when she heard it he measured six measures of Bali and laid it on her and she went into the City and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who are thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of Bali gave him me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then now one is said sit still my daughter until now know how the matter will fall there is a matter that was going to fall he says sit still and know the glory of God hallelujah for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day anything that you have learned before God when you have chosen the way of the Lord God will never rest Because of You beloved brothers and sisters God will never rest until he has finished everything that he's dealing with you again that you are put before God he says stay stand still and see the power of God Hallelujah Moses said the same thing when they came before the Red Sea and the people were murdering and were crying and he said hey people of Israel stands here and you see the glory of God this morning the Egyptian that you see you will never see them again in your life oh brother he said God will not rest until he has done everything God is Not resting in my life God is Not resting in your life God is Not resting in your life God will continue to perform what you need to perform Hallelujah there is nothing like choosing God's way that is why I love that song I want God's way to be my way outside Johnny here below for there is no other Highway that that child of God should go though the road be Steep and rough if he leads me is enough I want God's way to be my way every day Hallelujah but if God leads me is enough for me I want God's way to be my way every day I want God's way brother sister no matter the challenges no matter the frustrations no matter the disappointments no matter their enjoyment I want God's way to be my way [Music] oh Hallelujah so amen mama said that is right they had a promise of victory and that's what God told Joshua when you come to Total obedience then you can have possession are you catching it brother but aren't you totally obey Ruth totally obeyed you've got to completely Surrender Your Own thoughts your own will your own mind and the mind of Christ operates in you that is what's First Corinthians 2 16 told us we must have the mind of Christ we have the mind of Christ and that is what is operating within us if you have the mind of Christ in you you wouldn't say the days of Miracle has passed you can't it's impossible if you have the mind of Christ in you right now you not said that the Bible is right in some places and not in others what a confused state are you in Hallelujah the mind of Christ will sanction everywhere that Christ ever said it is right so if you don't use your own mind just use his might amen the world has nothing to do with this brother it's revelation talk on the word footsteps is Victory he told Joshua everywhere the soul of your food shall tread I have given unto you few steps was Victory brother sister and I tell you today let's tread on the lands that God give us Divine Healing powers of God everything coming into Christ is like going down to the big arcade down here or going into a variety store just think in a variety store there are abundance of things I look all around there everything in there the shelves are full of nice pretty things and everything that is in like they are all mine every one of them belongs to me I can go over and take what I want that is what the prophet said he said in Christ Jesus it's like a variety store like the Walmart like the target Robert what do you what did you take me to where did you take me to the shop that we went to Lara time ah conqueror why would my sister Mary a lot of things amen but you go and take what you want is that not it oh yes how many people have you seen them coming out from Walmart and I've taken all the things from Walmart and they are taking it to their homes it's impossible but you go and get what you want what I will take this morning maybe sister Rosa will take a different cream but Joshua will take a different thing but someone will take a different thing but you know we need those things and so the prophet is saying that in Jesus Christ there are a lot of good things in there oh my are you catching the brothers are you catching these sisters in Jesus Hallelujah he says Christ is our Variety Store and uh and anything you have need of he will supply it if I need healing oh God I will take it if I need Joy I will take it Victory I will take it it's all hanging around in God's big the righteous tour man and I have possession and you have possession of everything amen amen and amen and amen if when you are baptized with the Holy Ghost we all know that there were there was some time that the people were frustrating people not to listen even to Jesus Christ they said Jesus Christ have a bad spirit he was a belzebub he was that he was that his birth was illegitimate so God cannot use him they said all this into discourage the people but when the Romans Centurion met Jesus he didn't see any of that but you saw in Jesus Christ the power of healing and he beat Jesus Jesus said I will come then he looked to Jesus he's a master there's no need now you come to my my house I have a I'm a man of authority I have servants under me I command this goal and they go this come and they come in you don't need to come to my home just pick the work Hallelujah just speak the word the man have entered into the Variety shop and he was taking what he needed [Music] Jesus look at him he said no now this faith I have never seen it in Israel let it be as you have requested immediately the servant got healed what can we say about the woman with that blood issue for 12 years he has been from One hospital to another one physician to another one specially to another and there was no solution meanwhile there have been one not to listen to Jesus Christ but when Christ got to that spot with millions of people surrounding him the woman said no even though they are saying Jesus is not good but I can feel something in him and there's something if only I can touch the hair of His Garment that would be not for me and the bible say that the woman crawl among the you know the tranche and was able to touch the hand of Jesus Christ then immediately Jesus said Peter somebody have touched me epita was a joke because how can you say that somebody after you master that when we're coming a lot of people were touching you here and there why do you say Jesus said Peter you don't know the kind of touch is this is right many people have touched me but that those were ordinary touches but this touch is a touch of demand a part of authority a touch of faith effect of Revelation because the woman said if I can touch who taught the woman that [Music] who taught the woman no teases no geography compliment no historical information it was by Revelation you say if I can Touch the Hem of its garment I'll be made oh and immediately Jesus said that you have gone out of me oh Peter the touch of that woman have taken battle out of me oh brother that is still virtue in Jesus Christ this morning if you can reach him and touch him right now something will happen to your experience amen oh my God I feel good this morning Russell can I jump into the puppet right now I want my stature to be so big because I'm rejoicing in the Lord Jesus I have also entered into the variety store of Jesus Christ and are taking what belongs to me and nobody brother I said nobody can take it from me he said I have The Possession and you have your possession of everything that is in that Variety shop amen do you remember the story of the mama opposal even an animal a creature what told that creature that there was a man there that can pray for it all right that's so good sometimes I wonder about things of this nature but I cannot question God I only need to believe the creature didn't have soul to believe or not you know to disbelief but what happened that this creature with all wounds up in her body crawl the purpose that he was surprised how it was able to even claw the highway right and come and be at his door and he commanded him get out from here I can kill you he went inside and came out and the creature was still lying and then he realized I know something is at stake it took a clean look about the creature and he found out he needed help so he removed his heart and he knelt lay his hands and pray a simple prayer Lord if this is the reason why this creature is here Grant a desire and immediately all the wounds vanish even the mama opossum entered into Jesus Christ the right to store and took what he wanted how much more you how much more you how much

Christ he said it can even come that perhaps where you want to take the pain from you need a ladder oh brother he said God have got a ladder in that shop there is a provision of leather in that shop and you say what is the ladder the ladder is Jesus Christ himself climb on Jesus Christ and take what belongs to you if you walk on God's way God will surely prove himself that he exists amen when God opened the way for Israel they rejected it they didn't take God's way they refused to go God's way Hallelujah and because they didn't receive John the Baptist when God's will come in the way of the Messiah they didn't see it and they crucified him I remember when Pharaoh I'm sorry a pilate asked them and what about Jesus they say crucify him they didn't want his way they trust their own way and that is why Israel have suffered till today they trust their own way you know what I love about this when they chose their own way and rejected the way of God God turned to be gentiles oh Hallelujah God tend to win let us read that scripture in closing okay I hope I'm not taking too much time amen let's read out Acts chapter 13 quickly amen Acts chapter 13 we read in verse 44. Acts 13. and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God but when the Jews saw the multitudes that they were filled with Envy see you not believe and we are believing and you are jealousy you got it and speak against those things which were spoken by poor contradicting and blasphemy then Paul and Barnabas Works bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself on worthy of everlasting life law will turn to the Gentiles they rejected God's will and God brought the way to us oh man 47 for so had the Lord commanded us saying I have said thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should not be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles have this they were glad and they glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed it Hallelujah [Applause] that was the way of the Lord they rejected it and it came our way and we grabbed it praise be to the name of our god oh brother I am so glad that today you and I we are on God's way let's keep moving on God's way Hallelujah when you read Psalm 27 he said Teach Me The Way of the Lord can we add that scripture quickly I am leaving you amen psalm 27. psalm 27. quickly psalm 27. verse 11 okay I hope you are not tired Psalm 27 verse 11 teach me thy way O Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of my enemies foreign teach me thy way oh Lord I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name the last scripture Psalm 119 and verse 33 Psalm 119 and verse 33 Teach Me O Lord the way of thy status and I shall keep it onto the end can the Church Say Amen can the Church Say Amen say Amen let's walk in the way of the Lord [Music] and when we are in God's way brother everything that is in Jesus belongs to us amen where he leads me I will follow when he calls me I will answer oh my Lord please teach me how to know your way when he calls me I will answer when he called me I will answer oh my Lord please teach me how to know your way hey let me sing it in my local language and I'll hand over the puppy to brother Samuel dimakai named she is [Applause] [Music] the Lord bless all of us the Lord strengthen us the Lord make his face shine upon us in a place that we find ourselves we should meditate upon God's word he said in the night in the day when we sleep when we sit we should meditate upon God's will amen God bless all of us [Applause] [Music] stand thank you I know today is not Thanksgiving but yet it is you know to a real believer every day is a Thanksgiving for what God has has done for us and you know it's just isn't it so precious how the Holy Spirit just takes the words those things which we know which we've heard maybe it's your first time hearing it but for some of us things that we've heard but God has a way of so inspiring things afresh to us for presently right now that's the difference between man and God has given us his word it's a lamp unto our feet and it's God shows us that the word of God is just as inspired it might have been a promise that inspired you a month ago might have been a year ago but for the present need God can come right back around and Inspire that word because it's all him making himself known I am the ever-present god in your need in your situation and in your life my goodness what a what a comfort it is what a comfort to think of when we put ourselves where Ruth was because Ruth her life though she and herself never prophesied with her mouth but through her life being yielded to God it was a prophecy of the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour and we see that that it's something that Hal Ruth she just trusted she rested and there was a tug that was in her heart but REM tells us in the Holy Ghost series he said what it was he said that Vision that caught a hold in Ruth's heart what it was is there was a purpose to be fulfilled amen and Ruth pressed on I just think you know what what what uh encouragement that in the midst of every part of the journey at times we have to push times you have to press That's all part of this Moment In the Journey amen but what is so precious is is when you have chosen God's way that God has set before us and said this is my way and when we would choose that way that God has already laid out before us this is my way then we can expect the accompaniment of God in every step of the way I'm so glad about that I tell you this morning certainly I believe that we have been encouraged amen we have been encouraged amen Hallelujah and God will see us through all the way all the way he is a God that whatever he begins he finishes amen he's not like some of us who may have a reputation of don't let that person start on your house don't let them do a project because if they start the project good luck you'll be left with an unfinished project you know I've known people like that you don't let them start you don't let them forget it you might want it but forget it I don't really want it because why you'll just see something unfinished not God and God knew exactly what he was getting into when he chose you and I he saw all of our failures he saw all of our mistakes so he certainly did not choose US based on our own stability he chose us because we were a part of him and he cannot deny himself amen we come from God and we're going back to God Amen Let us let's press with everything that's within us how many say I'm willing to press willing to push willing to obstacles that as brother Daniel Illustrated their obstacles then in a way move it out of the way don't let the obstacle determine and say ah the obstacle's too great I it must not be for me no the obstacle is there to test where is your faith our faith is in Jesus Christ and This Promise is for me so if I've got to pray that obstacle out of the way I'm going to pray it out of the way because what I have need of is in the Lord and I'm going to get there brother said if it's a promise that's up a little bit too high he said get that ladder of prayer and climb up there and get it oh my I think God for his Mercy what encouragement amen what encouragement you have a song to sing in that let's sing that song and then I'm going to keep pressing on Amen [Music] when Satan tries to stop me turn me aside says no need for you to go on no need
