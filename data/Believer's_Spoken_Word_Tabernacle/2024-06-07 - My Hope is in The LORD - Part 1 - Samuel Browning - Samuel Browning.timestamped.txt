[0:00] about something that's thrown in the air
[0:02] and well I I hope this is God's will and
[0:04] I no you better not you better not throw
[0:06] anything up like that Hing it's God's
[0:09] will are you with me it's where faith is
[0:12] revealed then you've got an expectation
[0:14] no matter what happens that God is in
[0:17] control God has revealed to my heart
[0:20] that this is his will that even when
[0:23] things go wrong and things that are
[0:25] negative don't you see how powerful it
[0:26] is to really know the will of God that's
[0:29] how power f it is to walk in God's will
[0:32] it doesn't mean that we won't be tested
[0:34] but it means that in the midst of the
[0:36] testing when everything is shaking
[0:38] around us that even where we and
[0:41] ourselves it seems like it's swimming
[0:43] around in our head but there is an
[0:45] anchor on the inside because the will of
[0:48] God is Faith revealed from God and
[0:51] that's why we can have hope to say where
[0:54] I see like there's no hope like job job
[0:57] said there ain't no cattle that can
[0:58] reproduce more ble there ain't no more
[1:01] camels that can reproduce more camels
[1:03] but there was a power inside of job's
[1:06] soul that held job through it all and
[1:10] even when job wasn't aware of it up here
[1:13] it held him and at the end of it when it
[1:16] all broke forth he could say I know my
[1:18] redeemer
[1:20] liveth this is why it's so powerful
[1:23] Faith where it has an anchor in our soul
[1:26] and job was able to stand there and know
[1:29] I've got a great greater
[1:33] expectation sir aren't you glad that
[1:35] Faith delivers an
[1:37] expectation so thankful for the love of
[1:39] God it brings forth a trust this is why
[1:43] when the prophet said when the doctors
[1:45] would shake his head he said can you
[1:48] trust him in that time he said can you
[1:51] trust him when everything else is gone
[1:55] yes Can Am what a what a what a
[1:57] statement he says he says you need an
[1:59] overflowing baptism of love divine love
[2:02] let me just say it like this Lord each
[2:05] and every day of my life I want a fresh
[2:08] refilling I want a fresh refilling of
[2:10] the love of God you say is that
[2:12] scripture Jude said keep yourselves in
[2:14] the love of God it shows there are
[2:17] battles to try to pull us what out of
[2:19] that realm that God has intended for you
[2:22] and I to live in but keep yourselves in
[2:25] the love of
[2:27] God oh glory be to God oh it seems like
[2:30] you pray and your prayer is not answered
[2:32] do you still love him is there something
[2:35] that keeps purging you on notice what is
[2:38] this something that's purging you on
[2:40] that makes you go on when others would
[2:42] have turned around and said if that's
[2:45] how he's going to be and what what good
[2:47] is it for me to serve him that's when
[2:48] there's a selfish motive involved you do
[2:51] not serve God because of what he can do
[2:54] for you you serve God because you
[2:57] realize without him I am absolutely
[2:59] nothing I am a sinner I was on my way to
[3:03] hell but the blood of Jesus Christ was
[3:05] shed for my sin dead and there's a life
[3:08] inside of that blood that is present to
[3:11] change me and deliver me as a new
[3:15] creation I don't serve him because of
[3:17] what he can do for me I serve him
[3:20] because his love came down and projected
[3:23] to me when I was nothing I was in the
[3:27] mud and the m i was unworthy
[3:30] [Applause]
[3:32] I was not worthy you are not worthy but
[3:36] God rich and
[3:42] mercy and that's something in your heart
[3:44] keeps purging you on are you hearing me
[3:47] now when you feel like letting down
[3:50] there's something that purges you on
[3:52] take one more step there something keeps
[3:55] purging you on something tells you well
[3:57] just stay home tonight something purges
[3:59] you on
[4:00] something says you might as well turn
[4:02] loose but there's something got a hold
[4:03] of you that says keep going on there's
[4:06] something you find yourself here you are
[4:08] you find yourself there how do you find
[4:11] yourself there are you hearing me now
[4:13] you wondering about Transportation how
[4:16] did Phillip get here to the unic let me
[4:18] ask you something you might think of
[4:20] look upon that as something great I'm
[4:22] telling you right here tonight there are
[4:25] lives and hearts that you wonder how am
[4:27] I sitting here tonight with a faith in
[4:30] my heart with the strength in my life
[4:32] let me tell you what that is that's the
[4:34] same holy spirit that lifted up Phillip
[4:37] and presented him where he needed to
[4:40] be
[4:43] [Applause]
[4:45] Hallelujah Romans
[4:47] 5 verse one therefore being justified by
[4:52] faith we have peace with God through our
[4:55] Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have

[5:03] we stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[5:09] glory of
[5:12] God we have access by by by faith faith
[5:16] has given us an
[5:18] access into his presence and we're
[5:21] standing there by his grace you know
[5:24] what Grace is Grace is not Grace is not
[5:27] telling you how unfit you are Grace lets
[5:30] you know what rightfully belongs to you

[5:35] Grace himself or Grace personified

[5:41] become the very way for your life no
[5:43] matter what the circumstance no matter
[5:46] what the situation the grace of God
[5:48] stands for your
[5:50] life
[5:52] my and you rejoice in hope in an
[5:55] expectation of the glory of
[5:58] God oh not not only so but we glory in
[6:01] tribulations
[6:03] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[6:08] patience and patience experience and
[6:13] experience hope wow you see experiences
[6:17] that you've been through are you hearing
[6:18] me now experiences you've been through
[6:21] is what's created the expectation for
[6:24] the trial you're in right now that's
[6:26] right things that you've been through
[6:28] let's call up David a moment David how
[6:30] can you stand here and you're calling
[6:32] this uncircumcised Philistine how you
[6:35] calling out because I've had
[6:37] experiences the bear and the L I've seen
[6:40] the same God I know him and so because
[6:43] of experiences David could say I've got
[6:47] hope in the Lord I'm not walking out
[6:49] here with I wonder if it's going to be
[6:51] David how do you know it's going to
[6:52] happen or how's it going to be I don't
[6:54] know but I know one thing he is an
[6:57] uncircumcised Philistine I'm standing
[6:59] here as a covenant child of God he
[7:02] cannot stand there and tear down the
[7:04] enemies of or the children of God he
[7:07] walked out there with an
[7:10] expectation the same way you can walk to
[7:13] an expectation of a doctor's
[7:16] report the doctor can say this and say
[7:18] that I don't we don't think nothing bad
[7:20] about them they're only read they only
[7:22] can read the instruments and the
[7:23] knowledge that they're given but you've
[7:25] got a different report and you've
[7:28] watched God move on the seen in your own
[7:30] life in the life of others and
[7:32] testimonies throughout here as
[7:34] experiences that you're a part of you
[7:36] might say it didn't happen to me but
[7:38] your prayers was part of it God might
[7:40] have used your hands God might have used
[7:42] your lips you were a part of it there
[7:44] are
[7:46] experiences and those
[7:49] experiences build an
[7:53] expectation
[7:55] Hallelujah glory be to God and hope vers
[7:59] five hope maketh not
[8:02] ashamed cuz this expectation in in
[8:05] confetti thrown up in the air no this is
[8:07] a hope that faith is said here you go
[8:10] what do I do expect all
[8:12] things because this is why because the
[8:16] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[8:18] by the Holy Ghost which is given to
[8:21] us there's a cake down off of South
[8:24] Africa Spurgeon writes about it when he
[8:26] when he picks this up there's a cake
[8:28] down there that it was actually called
[8:30] the Cape of storms and there was Sailors
[8:33] that tried to go down through there and
[8:34] sail around that Cape but every time
[8:37] they got to a certain place storms over
[8:40] through the vessels and caused them to
[8:41] turn back but eventually there came some
[8:45] with different vessels and these that
[8:47] came with different vessels they were
[8:49] regarded as Boulder Navigators they they
[8:52] were they had ships that were built for
[8:54] it and when they made the turn around
[8:57] this cape it no longer is called the
[8:59] Cape of storms it now has been called
[9:02] the Cape of Good Hope Hallelujah let me
[9:04] tell you something before our champion
[9:08] came man would run up against death and
[9:12] right there it was but he was hidden
[9:14] away in Paradise but there stepped one
[9:16] from the portals of Glory he was built
[9:21] sufficiently it was not of this building
[9:24] of this Tabernacle it was God's word
[9:27] that had been spoken and prepared for
[9:29] you and I and he passed that Cape where
[9:32] it's no longer trebling a Cape of storms
[9:35] but now it's a Cape of Good Hope and the
[9:38] same almighty God has made a way for you
[9:41] and through your tests through your
[9:43] trials you're standing as a witness
[9:45] where was a Cape of storms it's a Cape
[9:48] of Good Hope because my expectation is
[9:51] in the God who brought me through that
[9:53] trial he's still God in this trial
[9:59] though the circumstances don't look
[10:01] alike but he's still the same God don't
[10:04] have to be the same circumstances he's
[10:06] the same God and I'm still a
[10:10] Believer Philippians 1:19 for I know
[10:14] that this shall turn to my salvation
[10:16] through your prayer and the supply of
[10:18] the spirit of Jesus Christ according to
[10:21] my Earnest expectation and my hope that
[10:25] in nothing I shall be ashamed but that
[10:28] with all boldness as always so now also
[10:31] Christ shall be magnified in my body
[10:34] whether it be by life or by death for
[10:37] for me to live is Christ and to die is
[10:41] gain Paul said my expectation is in the
[10:46] Lord Paul you might die that don't
[10:48] hinder
[10:50] it Paul what do you mean Paul said come
[10:52] here a minute let me tell you something
[10:54] death at one time was our Master death
[10:57] at one time was like the big old bad
[10:59] Boogeyman but there came one down from
[11:01] Glory that spoiled the principalities
[11:04] that despoiled death and the hell and
[11:07] the grave conquered Satan's Trinity rose
[11:09] up on the Easter morning and sent back
[11:11] the Holy Ghost as a witness and Paul do
[11:14] you know you might die but listen death
[11:17] is no longer my master or I'm no longer
[11:20] subject to it but death has become my
[11:23] servant death can only pull me into the
[11:26] presence of God that's why there's no
[11:29] disease no disease takes a child of God
[11:33] are you hearing me this unfortunate
[11:35] circumstance that didn't take it death
[11:37] is a servant to a child of God death as
[11:41] the prophet described is just like the
[11:44] horse on the carriage that pulls us from
[11:48] this to here and he said it's just like
[11:51] a little shock in the body and you're
[11:54] there oh Hallelujah you say what are you
[11:57] talking about I'm talking about the C of
[11:59] Good Hope all right are you with me now
[12:02] in this generation uh God I believe has
[12:05] allowed me to see beyond the curtain of
[12:06] time and I have seen you all there GL
[12:11] what is it beyond the Cape of storms now
[12:13] in the Cape of Good Hope no matter what
[12:16] we have to go through no matter the
[12:18] tests the trials no matter the
[12:20] disappointments I know where my destiny
[12:22] is how do you know that because the Lord
[12:26] is my portion saith my soul
[12:30] thank you God sometimes things even what
[12:33] we're hoping for even
[12:36] scripturally sometimes things don't
[12:38] happen the way that maybe we think
[12:40] they're going to happen see God Only God
[12:43] when he lets out a promise then God will
[12:45] let out the details as he wants to know
[12:47] but he keeps us in expectation and just
[12:50] because we might get our expectation
[12:53] might get a little off it don't stop
[12:55] God's word are you with me John's eye
[12:57] got filmed over right right John's eye
[13:00] he was in prison he said oh he says go
[13:02] ask him if he's the one or do we look
[13:03] for another after the compliment that
[13:05] was paid but you realize John spoke at
[13:07] the river not because of relation but
[13:10] John spoke because the word had said
[13:12] upon whom Thou shalt see the dove
[13:14] descend the same is he so John was
[13:17] speaking by a revealed word confirmed by
[13:20] the spirit of God coming upon it so it
[13:22] was not John under enthusiasm under
[13:25] emotion of I see of this or I see of
[13:27] that no it was a certain word of God
[13:30] that he spoke but now in the humanity
[13:33] here he is standing back there and you
[13:35] know he he he wasn't seeing things
[13:37] happen the way he thought they ought to
[13:39] happen is that right in the message
[13:41] forgotten beatitude what a beautiful
[13:43] message brother R goes into it he want
[13:45] and seeing things happen the way he
[13:46] thought it should happen now I'm sure
[13:47] every one of us have been there even
[13:49] with certain things we're praying about
[13:51] where we maybe we looking listen your
[13:53] expectation is not wrong but look at it
[13:55] and say Lord that something may not be
[13:58] happening or might go according to how I
[14:00] didn't think it was going to happen but
[14:02] it does not hinder God's promise one bit
[14:05] and let me tell you what God did for
[14:07] John he did not go down there and send
[14:09] the disciples and run him down and say
[14:11] what a sorry guy he was but he built him
[14:14] up in the front of those disciples and
[14:16] he said there's not a man born among
[14:18] women greater than John he said take the
[14:20] word down there what you see taking
[14:22] place take the word why he knew John was
[14:25] a word man he was a prophet brother if
[14:28] there's any encour enouragement that you
[14:30] I are going to see and receive it's got
[14:32] to come by the word if there's anything
[14:34] to take away my doubt or my Gloom it's
[14:37] got to come by the word is that right
[14:41] and here they were walking along and
[14:44] John himself remember John when he
[14:47] received that word it dismissed that
[14:50] Gloom there were some disciples when the
[14:53] resurrection took place they were
[14:56] walking along copius and a friend I
[14:59] always like that
[15:01] scripture I like how brother Brown tells
[15:03] in message Paradox he said he was with a
[15:06] friend well I know to to receive a
[15:09] prophet in the name of a prophet is to
[15:10] receive a prophet's reward and that's to
[15:12] be a friend of a prophet so that that's
[15:15] me I'm there I'm walking with this word
[15:19] how about you I'm walking with this word
[15:20] I I believe that God God's identified so
[15:23] to me these are not just things that
[15:24] just said it's with a friend and I
[15:26] believe I'm a friend not because I'm
[15:29] anything I I believe I'm a friend just
[15:30] like Abram Abram didn't seek out God God
[15:32] sought him out and the Bible said he was
[15:34] called the friend of God is that right
[15:38] now think about this you want to be a
[15:39] friend of God you just do what God tells
[15:41] you to do you Just Surrender Your Heart
[15:43] to God and you know what God speaks
[15:45] friendly to you and you respond back to
[15:47] it and say Amen Lord I accept that be
[15:50] unto me you repent of your sins you're
[15:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:54] Christ you look to the Lord for the Holy
[15:56] Ghost what is it it's receiving God's
[15:59] friendly words then then what if you
[16:01] become a friend of God my my and here
[16:06] they were walking and they said in verse
[16:09] 21 we trusted hoped
[16:12] expected that it had been he which had
[16:16] redeemed Israel beside all this it's a
[16:18] third day since all this has happened I
[16:21] mean to them it was just
[16:24] like it didn't H it didn't happen the
[16:26] way we thought it was and and this is
[16:28] the the third day right you see it's
[16:32] like this seemed like all hope
[16:34] was stripped out of them you know the
[16:37] Bible says in the Book of Proverbs hope
[16:40] deferreth it just makes the heart weak
[16:43] what do I mean by hope deferred well
[16:46] there's an
[16:47] expectation but you see if it seems like
[16:49] it's delayed or it's not happening then
[16:51] that's where the the the heart itself
[16:53] can can become weak but this is why
[16:55] David would could say that Lord my I had
[16:58] I had I my soul had waited on thy
[17:01] salvation but my hope is in the
[17:04] Lord though things aren't coming like I
[17:06] thought they would come but I'm still
[17:08] trusting in you
[17:09] Lord because it maybe ain't how I had it
[17:11] figured out but your word will come to
[17:13] pass there's not enough Devils that can
[17:16] keep it about there's not enough Gloom
[17:18] the devil can put around your life to
[17:20] hold you back from being a real son and
[17:22] daughter of God there's not enough that
[17:24] can keep you back because God has spoken
[17:28] who can but
[17:30] prophesied we trusted we hoped we
[17:33] expected but here is God stepping on the
[17:36] scene didn't disturb him a bit he just
[17:38] looked and he said oh fools and slowth
[17:40] heart to believe all the prophets have
[17:42] spoken you know what he did he went
[17:44] right down through the scriptures and
[17:46] begin to take them right through the
[17:47] scriptures and show everything that
[17:50] happened was exactly according to
[17:54] prophecy is that right so that they
[17:56] would know him by the word
[17:59] that's how you and I know him we know
[18:01] him in the Fulfillment of his word is
[18:05] that right it created a faith in them
[18:07] that just let me tell you what it did
[18:09] that opening of the word right there
[18:11] created such a faith in them that they
[18:14] were ready to receive the evidence and
[18:18] confirmation of the promise of the Holy
[18:20] Ghost in their own life it made them
[18:23] ready to after this event the Bible said
[18:26] they went with joy unto Jerusalem
[18:30] why they had an
[18:32] expectation Faith had handed them a
[18:36] hope is that right it handed them an
[18:40] expectation that's why the revelation of
[18:43] the will of God is Faith and Faith it is
[18:47] produced from love it gives a true pure
[18:51] expectation to the believer I love that
[18:54] don't you I love this scripture right
[18:56] here these these passages out of Psalm
[18:57] 62 you no doubt recognize it this is out
[19:00] of like the message Shalom but I I I
[19:02] love this passage of scripture my soul
[19:05] wait thou only upon God oh yeah I think
[19:09] that's fitting in the message Shalom let
[19:11] me tell you why because the prophet
[19:13] would talk about the advancement of the
[19:14] hour the first message Shalom he spends
[19:17] all that time with those in the trailer
[19:18] court I think about two and a half two
[19:20] two hours and 40 minutes is a long time
[19:21] but he comes at the end towards the end
[19:23] of that message he said now Brethren
[19:24] Brethren be
[19:26] patient andan he talks about all the
[19:28] Fulfillment of the word but then he said
[19:29] be patient he said don't don't don't try
[19:31] to go out and make something happen why
[19:34] would people want to go out and make
[19:35] something happen than my friends in the
[19:37] Fulfillment and seeing God opening his
[19:39] word but one of the things that you and
[19:41] I we are not we are not privy to and
[19:44] that's the exact time moment frame of
[19:48] fulfillment we know we're living in the
[19:50] hour we know we're living in the end
[19:52] time is that right but aren't you
[19:54] thankful that God makes you and I aware
[19:56] of the season and the hour and the time
[19:58] and the promise that we need to be
[19:59] looking for let me tell you the promise
[20:01] that we need to be looking for right now
[20:03] more than anything else is the
[20:04] rapture that's what this message come to
[20:07] produce it came to produce a people that
[20:09] are expecting not people that are
[20:11] becoming adapted to this world but a
[20:13] people that are under an expectation
[20:16] that at any
[20:18] moment at any moment my loved ones are
[20:22] going to appear before me at any moment
[20:24] I'm going to see the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:26] you said that's 30 or 40 days but I'm
[20:28] living in a moment to see him
[20:32] come
[20:34] Hallelujah my soul wait thou only upon
[20:38] God for my I love this for my
[20:42] expectation is from him man didn't give
[20:46] it to me Church didn't give it to me
[20:48] denomination didn't give it to me God
[20:51] have given me this
[20:55] expectation are you with me the Bible
[20:57] said let every Every Man's word be a lie
[21:00] and let God's word be
[21:02] true right every one of us have made
[21:05] promises sometimes and had to call and
[21:06] said brother I'm sorry I'm just not
[21:09] going to be able to come over and cut
[21:10] your bushes
[21:11] today my brother I'm sorry or honey I'm
[21:14] sorry I I just wasn't able to get that
[21:16] painting done on that wall today right
[21:19] and we've had I'll tell you I'll get to
[21:20] it first thing Monday morning but not
[21:23] God right right you and I had things
[21:26] sometimes that come up sickness or calls
[21:29] or unexpected events not God nothing
[21:32] takes God by surprise let me tell you
[21:35] something God's never been in a
[21:39] crisis never God's never been in a
[21:41] crisis God's never had an anxiety
[21:44] attack come on that's why he can keep
[21:46] you and I in perfect peace think about
[21:49] it if he wasn't the Prince of Peace
[21:51] where you can I work could you and I
[21:53] have hope but the Bible said for he is
[21:56] our peace
[21:58] [Applause]
[22:00] Hallelujah my expectation is from him he
[22:04] has delivered to me the
[22:07] expectation for what I'm to be looking
[22:09] for he only he he he only is my rock and
[22:14] my he he is my defense I shall not be
[22:20] moved in God is my salvation and my
[22:25] glory the strength of my The Rock of my
[22:29] strength and my refuge is in
[22:34] God look at Abraham a
[22:39] promise God said I'll bless you right
[22:42] you'll be a blessing you're going to be
[22:44] a father of many
[22:48] nations he received that
[22:51] Revelation stay with me now he received
[22:54] that Revelation you can look back in his
[22:56] life and say well I don't see it oh you
[22:59] didn't see it in full manifestation
[23:02] right but you let it keep working right
[23:05] you let it keep working that's it you
[23:08] let that Revelation keep working of
[23:09] Jesus Christ in your life it'll take you
[23:12] all the way from Genesis 11 to little
[23:15] things that you might look at and God
[23:17] calls you higher God will bring you in
[23:19] situations like genesis 13 separations
[23:22] will come God will bring you in to
[23:24] situations in Genesis 14 where you look
[23:26] at and say but they took lot but God
[23:28] will let you see what it is to live a
[23:30] separated life and just how powerful it
[23:32] is to be separated to the word because
[23:35] when you're separated to the word then
[23:37] you've got jurisdiction Authority and
[23:39] power over every unclean Spirit why
[23:42] because the word is what's reigning in
[23:44] your
[23:45] life God takes you into full
[23:49] manifestation but that Revelation it
[23:51] works out it's growing growing growing
[23:53] growing growing and pushing out so here
[23:56] he is walking around testifying
[23:59] of
[24:00] something that he
[24:02] himself has received by Revelation now
[24:07] is it all the way clear to Abraham at
[24:09] that time no because if it would have
[24:12] been
[24:13] clear then he wouldn't have listened to
[24:15] Sarah when she said take Hagar that's
[24:20] true but let me just tell you what hegar
[24:23] and ishmail was it was just an
[24:26] interruption
[24:30] right it's all was was an interruption
[24:33] your failure just an
[24:35] interruption it does not take away from
[24:37] what God has said about you it does not
[24:40] take away from what the word has said
[24:42] about you your failures right I let down
[24:44] on this and those are interruptions they
[24:46] do not take away from the counsel of God
[24:50] God's word cannot be
[24:52] [Music]
[24:53] defeated but here Abraham walks on with
[24:56] God and he's conf
[24:59] now think about it he doesn't know every
[25:01] little detail but he's already putting
[25:03] down payments at the
[25:05] hospital here's a here's here's a dime
[25:08] what's that for that that's that that's
[25:10] my bill for my wife and
[25:13] I
[25:16] okay you can just almost see after the
[25:18] glass is
[25:21] closed they probably get behind there
[25:24] can you believe this can you believe
[25:26] this these two old people are going to
[25:30] have a
[25:32] baby but you see he had to go through
[25:36] that
[25:37] ridicule you know what that ridicule
[25:39] proved that there was something greater
[25:42] than his feelings there was something
[25:45] greater than his
[25:46] feelings you think at times he didn't
[25:48] turn around and walk out of there and it
[25:50] might have been the first time that he
[25:52] was challenged it might have been like a
[25:53] little bit of a blush but he kept going
[25:55] he would say here's another dime every
[25:58] time he kept going and standing on God's
[26:00] word eventually he could walk out of
[26:01] that doctor's office there wasn't one
[26:03] flush on his face you know what it was
[26:06] it was the word he was feeding on that
[26:08] was building strength in his
[26:12] life and then it came to a place I love
[26:14] how Paul writes it here in Romans 4:8
[26:18] who against hope believed in Hope what
[26:21] was he beli what was the hope you're
[26:23] Abraham you're getting old and a matter
[26:25] of fact you know your stream of life is
[26:27] Dr
[26:29] up so you can't even produce another
[26:33] ishmail right against hope the
[26:36] expectation where all expectation is
[26:40] removed let me say it in the words the
[26:42] prophet said which is exactly the
[26:44] scripture he says in works as Faith
[26:46] Express all hopes is
[26:49] gone where God took away like what job
[26:52] was seeing that he spoke about the other
[26:54] night all hopes is gone he had nothing
[26:57] that he could sink his teeth into as a
[27:00] well I tell you that this I think it
[27:01] might work out you know how it is
[27:02] sometimes if this boss gets in place it
[27:05] just might hold the thing
[27:08] together you you all know what I'm
[27:10] talking about right but this is where
[27:13] all hopes is gone but look how the
[27:16] scripture writes it who against hope
[27:19] right believed in
[27:22] hope he had an expectation that was
[27:25] greater than the expectation of his
[27:28] mortal life his mortal life could stare
[27:31] at him every day in the mirror and say
[27:34] you're getting older he could look at
[27:36] his humanity and see there's no hope in
[27:38] it but there was a faith on the inside
[27:42] there was an expectation that looked
[27:45] beyond what he was
[27:47] seeing let me tell you God has delivered
[27:49] a word to your life and to my life to
[27:52] cause you and I to look beyond what
[27:54] we've seen look beyond what we know and
[27:57] look into what God has always known and
[28:00] thought about you and I Hallelujah no
[28:03] matter what you were told when you were
[28:05] little no matter what when Mom said oh
[28:07] you were a mistake you're not a mistake
[28:09] it was in God's
[28:11] mind it wasn't a
[28:15] chance
[28:17] hallelujah hallelujah God knew about
[28:20] your
[28:22] life hallelujah
[28:25] hallelujah and being not weak in faith
[28:27] he considered not his own body
[28:31] dead Faith had handed Abraham a true
[28:36] expectation and that Revelation kept
[28:38] growing in his life that and as that
[28:40] Revelation was growing he was feeding on
[28:42] that word you see how was he feeding on
[28:44] Sarah you feeling any different
[28:47] today Hallelujah right it's like us if
[28:50] our wife or our husband sick or
[28:52] something how you feel today oh man I I
[28:55] feel worse than yesterday
[28:59] oh remember those that were prayed for
[29:03] cancer and other things sometimes right
[29:06] afterwards that's when they were the
[29:10] sickest but that was the clearest sign
[29:13] of healing because the bloodstream was
[29:16] under the authority of the word of God
[29:18] for
[29:19] cleansing that's good right that's why
[29:22] brother BR says sometimes he says
[29:24] symptoms can be the biggest enemy to
[29:25] Faith it doesn't mean that symptoms
[29:27] aren't there just don't look at him
[29:30] don't look at him it may not be
[29:31] happening the way don't don't don't
[29:33] worry our expectation is in the Lord he
[29:35] said by his stripes I'm Healed I'm
[29:37] Healed I'm the Lord that Health all th
[29:39] disease that's what he said and he is
[29:42] the Lord is the portion of my
[29:45] soul my Hope's in him
[29:49] amen think about this the Bible says in
[29:51] Hebrews 11:9 by faith he sojourned in
[29:55] the land of promise as in a strange
[29:59] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[30:02] Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of
[30:04] the same promise that's good now Abraham
[30:06] it do mean that when you read this
[30:07] scripture it don't mean that Abraham
[30:09] wasn't
[30:10] friendly no doubt Abraham would be maybe
[30:13] he was you know like one of them guys
[30:14] you walk in you know to fers hey how you
[30:16] doing I'm doing good how you doing hey
[30:19] I'm doing wonderful how how how you'all
[30:20] been you have a good Memorial Day no he
[30:22] was a friendly guy but what he was
[30:25] Abraham was not going to be subjecting
[30:28] himself to support a fallen
[30:33] world he was out for one Mission and
[30:37] that was I'm looking for a city and I'm
[30:41] here to get everybody that wants to go
[30:45] amen is that right that's what he was
[30:48] there for in other words Abraham saying
[30:50] I'm not like lot I'm not interested to
[30:51] being a mayor of the city I'm not
[30:53] interested in turning around everything
[30:54] of this world I'm not getting tied up
[30:56] that's why the Bible said no man whom
[30:59] God had chosen to be a soldier
[31:02] entangleth himself with the Affairs of
[31:06] this life you have to watch that there
[31:08] are traps around and you know what them
[31:11] traps will do they'll take the
[31:13] expectation oh yeah away from your life
[31:17] brother Samuel I thought you said faith
[31:19] is the revelation of God's will it is
[31:21] and it will hand you in expectation but
[31:23] you've got to feed what God has given
[31:26] you and you feed it by drawing from The
[31:29] Source who spoke to you don't just draw
[31:32] and say well now I'll draw now I'm going
[31:34] over here no you you've got to continue
[31:36] to draw from that same source and when
[31:38] you do then it comes out like it did in
[31:40] Abraham's
[31:41] life watch this he looked for a
[31:45] city which had foundations he expected
[31:48] this is what looked for waited for
[31:51] looked for a city that had
[31:54] foundations cuz while he saw upon the
[31:56] Earth none of those cities had
[31:58] foundations what does that mean they
[31:59] didn't have foundations surely their
[32:01] walls would wouldn't have been able to
[32:03] stand they weren't built on God's word
[32:07] that's there wasn't built upon God's
[32:10] word that's so good there were cities
[32:13] that that had come about but yet here
[32:15] Abraham was looking for this city it was
[32:18] something in his heart do you realize
[32:19] what brother R tells us he said
[32:21] something told Abraham there's a city
[32:24] around here after he met mesic What did
[32:27] the meeting of mesic do it caused
[32:30] Abraham to go into a greater expectation
[32:33] Abraham where are you going early this
[32:35] morning I'm going to go find that City
[32:38] amen but Abraham what city no there's a
[32:41] city that has foundations there's a city
[32:45] that's sure there's a city because I met
[32:48] the king and the priest of that City you
[32:51] see what it did every meeting with God
[32:54] brought his expectation stronger every
[32:58] experience just intensified his
[33:01] expectation and his walk with God to
[33:04] where he got up where's it at he was
[33:06] looking for it and I love how the
[33:09] prophet says it in one little simple
[33:10] statement he says what was it he said
[33:13] that same faith that was in Abraham's
[33:16] heart that eventually led to Bringing
[33:18] forth an Isaac he said then he said came
[33:21] forth that Faith son that Faith seed and
[33:24] it was through that Faith seed that
[33:27] Abraham received entrance into the city
[33:30] he was looking for do you realize that's
[33:33] why the Holy Ghost inside of you that
[33:36] has raised up that seed on the inside
[33:38] that's your token your entrance in the
[33:41] Rapture that's your entrance into the
[33:44] New
[33:46] Jerusalem
[33:48] Hallelujah he made a
[33:51] way
[33:53] Hallelujah he is your righteousness he
[33:56] believed God and he was imputed unto him
[34:00] for righteousness
[34:05] hallelu
[34:10] hallu like
[34:14] Simeon Simeon received
[34:19] that God spoke to him it been promises
[34:23] all the way down through on the coming
[34:24] Messiah remember brother Brown describes
[34:26] he said that church was so small in the
[34:28] message birth pains he only a few people
[34:30] that was really really looking well you
[34:33] Brother Sam I thought you said that I
[34:34] thought that all the way through the
[34:35] scriptures there were people that were
[34:36] looking for the Messiah but you see
[34:38] listen friends and I want you to
[34:40] understand God's grace so so greatly it
[34:43] wasn't Simon that gave himself this this
[34:45] ability to see that's right it wasn't it
[34:48] wasn't Anna that gave herself the
[34:50] ability to see and that kind of
[34:52] expectation they were a part of the
[34:55] program of God and I want to tell you
[34:58] that where they might have been looked
[34:59] at as Outcast and no good and good for
[35:02] nothing and everything El they were
[35:03] looked over but God always knew right
[35:06] where they were and God when it came
[35:09] time to fulfill his word of Prophecy he
[35:13] had a voice on Earth at that time and
[35:16] the spirit of God would move not only
[35:19] there as it would come there and bring
[35:21] forth there within the very womb of Mary
[35:24] but here would come forth John all of
[35:26] these Witnesses were coming it created
[35:28] such a condition in the hearts of the
[35:31] Believers and they were looking and it
[35:33] created a greater expectation an
[35:36] expectation that caused them to stand in
[35:38] the face of ridicule an expectation that
[35:41] caused them to stand and know how can
[35:43] you follow this man how can you do this
[35:45] how can you believe this oh this man we
[35:48] we heard you know his mother was
[35:49] pregnated by a drunken Soldier you see
[35:52] what the word did to them it gave them
[35:54] an expectation to where that when the
[35:57] world to try to draw their attention
[35:59] down here their eyes had been lifted up
[36:02] to see only the promise of God's
[36:07] word
[36:10] hallelujah you take Simeon he went back
[36:12] in his office like he normally
[36:15] did maybe he made his cup of tea in the
[36:17] morning cup of coffee however you do
[36:22] it and about that
[36:25] time Glory the whole Holy Spirit the
[36:29] same one the Bible said revealed to him
[36:31] you're not going to die oh let me preach
[36:33] now a little bit you're not going to die
[36:35] until you've seen the Lord's Christ his
[36:39] salvation I don't care what kind of
[36:41] virus came near him I don't care what
[36:43] kind of a condition I don't care what
[36:45] kind of a report came you brother s
[36:47] Brother Sam you say that don't say that
[36:49] in the Bible but let's bring it down to
[36:51] reality Caleb was promised that mountain
[36:55] he got older but it never did away with
[36:57] the
[36:58] [Applause]
[36:59] promise Hallelujah I don't care how long
[37:01] you waited on the Holy Ghost but the
[37:04] Holy Ghost is still for you I don't care
[37:06] how many times you've been disappointed
[37:08] but it's still for you the promise of
[37:10] God belongs to you and the prophet said
[37:14] when God has spoke that to your heart
[37:16] you've got a right to expect the Holy
[37:21] Ghost you've got a right to expect it
[37:24] you've got a right to expect Deliverance
[37:27] [Applause]
[37:31] Hallelujah it doesn't matter what tried
[37:33] to take Simeon away and words could have
[37:36] come around him ridicule could have come
[37:38] around him trying to do everything they
[37:40] could to distract him it wasn't that he
[37:43] had some great DNA he had a promise he
[37:46] was feeding on it it created such an
[37:49] expectation to where he was able to look
[37:52] above the things of this life and say
[37:55] I'm looking for him
[37:58] [Music]
[38:02] do matter what came Caleb's way Caleb
[38:05] said I got a
[38:07] promise Caleb might have come up there
[38:10] his whiskers might have been long I
[38:11] don't
[38:12] know and everything
[38:15] else but when it came time to take
[38:17] promises and notice not just when they
[38:20] crossed the Jordan but notice how the
[38:23] spirit gives unction this is your time
[38:26] Caleb what I promised to you the spirit
[38:29] gave unction and Caleb went up to Joshua
[38:32] and said I remember what the prophet
[38:34] said to
[38:35] me he said that where my foot hath trod
[38:39] that belongs to me let me just bring
[38:40] that down to you the experiences you've
[38:43] had in your life the Holy Spirit
[38:45] sweeping over your life the spirit of
[38:47] God dealing with your heart those are
[38:49] places where your foot have tro and the
[38:52] spirit of God it rises in your heart to
[38:54] say that promise that mantle did not
[38:57] come upon my life for nothing that
[38:59] mantle has fallen upon my life it causes
[39:03] me to seek after that
[39:06] promise are you hearing me tonight
[39:09] [Applause]
[39:12] friends Caleb Grew Older that's
[39:15] true a lot of things Rose that's true
[39:18] but it didn't take it out of his heart
[39:21] he fed on that he became stronger cuz he
[39:23] said even that day he said I'm more able
[39:25] now than I was when it was made to me

[39:31] older I'm more ready

[40:08] been eating on that food I've been

[40:12] fact i' get beside myself in that tent

[42:08] part of it and he's been talking about
[42:11] this of the Messiah but you know he's
[42:14] always had a certainty about his life
[42:17] especially even it's grown stronger it's
[42:19] not an arrogance but a certainty about
[42:22] his life where he would come out here
[42:24] and he just kind of look and he just
[42:26] waiting but I'm noticing something today
[42:29] his steps are so
[42:32] directed this morning let's watch and
[42:37] Simeon led by the holy ghost that
[42:41] revealed the promise to him that let him
[42:44] know today is the day amen that is so
[42:51] good today yes sir is the day and led
[42:56] Simeon right yes right to right what he
[43:00] said he would see yes and when he saw it
[43:05] now thy servant can depart in peace mine
[43:11] eyes have seen thy
[43:13] salvation what did that Faith Delivered
[43:17] a hope the Holy Spirit took the word
[43:21] that was already
[43:23] spoken written and breathed
[43:27] and Simeon was a vessel that caught it
[43:31] nourished it cherished it I wonder in
[43:34] his
[43:35] office I wonder if he had excuse me for
[43:38] saying it this way because I know they
[43:39] don't have Pages like this but let's
[43:40] just say it was almost like this I
[43:42] wonder if he had Pages Doge
[43:46] geared like we might have markers I know
[43:49] they don't have it like this at Scrolls
[43:50] I realize that but I Wonder has Simeon
[43:53] no doubt he was going through all the
[43:55] promises of what had been spoken to that
[43:58] is so good and when he came out this is
[44:02] your day hallu I wonder if the same holy
[44:06] spirit is speaking to your heart this is
[44:09] your
[44:10] day this is your moment amen maybe this
[44:13] is your day for salvation to surrender
[44:16] your life and your heart to God maybe
[44:19] this is your life this is this is your
[44:21] day where the spirit of God there's been
[44:22] a longing and a craving and maybe just
[44:24] kind of brush it off but right now you
[44:26] recognize this is this is my day the
[44:28] Holy Spirit not brother Samuel but the
[44:30] Holy Spirit making it real to you this
[44:33] is your day brother Samuel it's a
[44:34] Thursday night it don't matter if it's
[44:36] Thursday night Sunday night it don't
[44:37] make no difference to God God's God's
[44:39] still God he's still God hallelujah he
[44:43] don't have to come on Sundays alone God
[44:45] comes wherever he's invited and he's
[44:47] welcome let me tell you something God
[44:49] has arranged this moment here tonight
[44:51] with you in mind with me in mind if the
[44:54] spirit of God would be speaking to your
[44:56] heart today is your
[44:58] day maybe it's for healing in your body
[45:01] Hallelujah maybe it's for deliverance of
[45:03] a besetting
[45:05] sin maybe it's for the Holy Ghost you
[45:09] know how he spoke to you he speaks to
[45:11] your heart today is your day what do I
[45:16] do follow him let your heart follow him
[45:21] because he will lead you into the
[45:24] promise that he has made and confirmed
[45:27] to your
[45:30] heart let's
[45:34] pray Heavenly
[45:38] Father Lord
[45:41] Jesus we've spoke
[45:44] Lord God what you would Lord lay Upon
[45:48] Our Hearts and you certainly Lord have
[45:50] taken us in Precious Places Lord to Lord
[45:55] breathe on only Upon Our Lives but in
[45:58] our
[45:59] lives now
[46:02] Lord I pray right here
[46:08] tonight or
[46:10] Jesus mayy right here there's a
[46:15] Simeon where it's been made known
[46:19] revealed to him by the Holy
[46:23] Ghost and Lord here to feed upon that
[46:26] promise
[46:26] [Music]
[46:28] now comes that moment today is the day
[46:33] maybe there's something Lord that
[46:35] stirred that heart
[46:37] that you ever think about where you come
[46:39] from and where you're
[46:41] going do you really know
[46:44] God do you really know who Jesus
[46:49] is or is it just a Sunday school story
[46:52] of what you've heard as far as you know
[46:57] but something that can be a pondering
[46:59] and then right here in this
[47:03] moment you
[47:07] realize there's someone who knows me
[47:09] who's
[47:10] speaking
[47:12] something let me tell you it's not a
[47:14] something
[47:16] it's it's the Lord
[47:18] Jesus a man cannot know you a man cannot
[47:21] speak to you a man cannot move your
[47:24] heart within that way a man might move
[47:26] your emot itions but cannot move your
[47:29] heart in a place to
[47:33] [Music]
[47:34] believe but I wonder right here tonight
[47:36] if you don't know
[47:38] him you would be in that place to say I
[47:42] want to surrender my
[47:43] life to the Lord
[47:47] Jesus I don't want to continue to walk
[47:50] my own
[47:53] way I want to surrender my life to him
[47:59] I want you to know the altar is open
[48:01] here
[48:02] tonight it's not necessarily the altar
[48:05] itself that has any virtue in
[48:07] it but an altar itself speaks of
[48:11] sacrifice and the real sacrifice starts
[48:14] in your heart where you sacrifice your
[48:17] own
[48:19] will that's where real the real altar
[48:21] takes
[48:22] [Music]
[48:24] place right here tonight perhaps the
[48:26] Holy Spirit just I know he
[48:30] is calling out
[48:33] today this is your
[48:35] day Lord for the Holy
[48:39] Spirit oh Grant it Lord
[48:42] Jesus Grant it
[48:45] Lord father this is your word you've
[48:49] given you said
[48:51] [Music]
[48:53] Lord for as many as the Lord our God
[48:56] shall call Lord you're still
[49:00] calling now I pray
[49:06] father Minister Lord to each life maybe
[49:10] the spirit of God would call to you may
[49:13] besetting sin something that it just
[49:14] seems like it just so easily beset
[49:20] you the Holy
[49:22] Spirit would call to your heart and
[49:25] breathe
[49:27] hope into your life to
[49:31] expect full
[49:36] Deliverance I wonder tonight you just
[49:38] claim that receive
[49:40] that same for the Holy
[49:44] Ghost to receive that to claim
[49:48] that same thing for salvation not just
[49:51] something that we just just recite out
[49:53] with our words but Lord God here the
[49:56] altar of my
[49:58] heart you're welcome to come here we
[50:01] would pray I'll pray with
[50:03] you but I know God is here to meet
[50:07] us according to his
[50:09] word he's here to give salvation he's
[50:13] here to give the Holy
[50:17] Ghost he's here to give
[50:20] healing
[50:23] Deliverance he's still the same God
[50:30] father Lord
[50:34] Jesus what you've inspired and laid on
[50:36] My Heart
[50:39] [Music]
[50:41] Lord I may not have done Lord a very
[50:45] good job of it
[50:47] but I just wanted to be led by
[50:50] [Music]

[50:55] Jesus you've delivered delivered your
[50:57] word to our hearts I I've said Lord what
[51:00] you what you give me to
[51:02] say but now it's up to us
[51:05] Lord what will we do with it
[51:08] Lord granted Lord the same Grace that
[51:11] was
[51:12] brought that brought it to us may we
[51:15] receive that same
[51:17] Grace in the name of Jesus
