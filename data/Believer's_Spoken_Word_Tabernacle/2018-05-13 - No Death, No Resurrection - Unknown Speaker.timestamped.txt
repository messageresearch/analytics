[48:13] it's not here in this assembly there's I
[48:15] know there's some that the mothers are
[48:17] not here and you know you just think of
[48:20] that you never know when it's gonna be
[48:21] maybe the last time you don't know that
[48:25] you know and I just want to say we so
[48:28] appreciate each and every one of our
[48:32] sisters and mothers that just really
[48:34] just standing and shining the gospel
[48:37] amen the light of this word in in the
[48:41] homeland among the children and among
[48:43] one another it's just I tell you that's
[48:45] a real real real blessing you say amen
[48:48] amen
[48:49] I tell you I'm so thankful for that I I
[48:52] think back too many times I remember you
[48:54] know my mom praying and you know in my
[48:58] and my dad and things like that and
[49:00] probably the one it's not that I
[49:02] remember them praying and praying with
[49:04] me and I hearing them pray but I'll tell
[49:06] you the one that you know I had to come
[49:09] inside from playing and that was my
[49:11] grandma my Mamaw browning when I stayed
[49:14] with her it was when she when she
[49:16] hollered I knew it was time to come
[49:19] inside but I knew this was gonna be a
[49:22] long break and I had to sit right there
[49:25] on the couch while she prayed but I'm so
[49:28] glad for that
[49:29] I'm so glad for that you know she she
[49:33] really just she really talked with him
[49:34] and and I think of that you know with
[49:36] with even with my mom and dad and course
[49:38] all of us have that that trust we and
[49:42] many of us can talk about different
[49:43] testimony so let's just get on into the
[49:46] word and amen Colossians chapter 1 verse
[49:50] 12 giving thanks unto the Father which
[49:55] hath made us meet to be partakers of the
[49:59] inheritance of the Saints and light who
[50:02] hath delivered us from the power of
[50:05] darkness and hath translated us into the
[50:08] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[50:12] redemption through his blood even the
[50:15] forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[50:19] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[50:22] creature for by him we're all things
[50:25] created that are in heaven and that are
[50:28] in earth visible and invisible whether
[50:30] they be Thrones or dominions or
[50:33] principalities or powers all things were
[50:36] created by him and for him and he is
[50:40] before all things and by him all things
[50:42] consist and he is the head of the body
[50:47] the church who is the beginning the
[50:50] firstborn from the dead that in all
[50:54] things he might have the preeminence for
[51:00] it pleased the father that in him should
[51:04] all fullness dwell and having made peace
[51:07] through the blood of his cross by him to
[51:12] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[51:17] I say whether they be things in earth or
[51:21] things in heaven amen
[51:24] may God bless you and bless the reading
[51:26] as word as you're being seated
[51:40] I want to continue to look at this
[51:42] thought we've been dealing with stages
[51:47] of reconciliation and primarily I've
[51:54] just want to continue the the part and
[51:57] the focus on it that if there is no
[52:00] death
[52:01] there is no resurrection and when we are
[52:06] looking at at this there has to be we we
[52:11] talk on we speak of the death and the
[52:14] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:17] but we recognize that that in this here
[52:21] it's his death that made a way that you
[52:25] and I might be able to die but what is
[52:28] resurrected in us is not the old life
[52:31] that dies but it's that life that we had
[52:35] with him before the foundation of the
[52:38] world so God is as all like when we were
[52:42] as we read all of this here in the book
[52:44] of Colossians this is all left up and in
[52:48] the hands of God it's all to the glory
[52:51] of Almighty God in bringing this to pass
[52:54] and we think back to the statement and
[52:57] this statement has just so resonated in
[52:59] my hearts I've shared it with you
[53:01] multiple times but them said it like
[53:04] this and God hiding himself in
[53:05] simplicity says now he hid himself his
[53:10] self in the death of Christ but
[53:13] manifested himself in the resurrection
[53:16] if there had not been any death there
[53:19] would not have been any resurrection and
[53:22] remember as just like the Lord has
[53:25] really been pressing this in our hearts
[53:27] that his death could not be forced this
[53:32] death could not be that of where the
[53:35] Lamb was forced to die but the lamb had
[53:38] to be willing to give his life it wasn't
[53:42] enough even for the Lamb himself the
[53:44] Lamb to die of old age that that
[53:46] wouldn't have debt wouldn't have
[53:47] satisfied it but it had to be that of a
[53:51] lamb and had to be an innocent one it
[53:53] be one who was willing to give his life
[53:56] in ransom for you and I and we know what
[54:00] a ransom payment is a ransom is where
[54:03] that there is one one or many that are
[54:07] in bondage and that are being held but a
[54:09] ransom is that which is required or is
[54:13] needed in order to release that which is
[54:17] being held and and there's only one that
[54:19] could pay this price and that would be
[54:22] God Himself come down and become one of
[54:25] us and and that's what this is stating
[54:27] here in Colossians 1 and we we see that
[54:29] so clearly that the Lord Jesus himself
[54:32] is not a second person it's not someone
[54:35] separate but it's God come down and
[54:38] become one at one of us because if we
[54:41] look at the expanse upon creation there
[54:44] was no one who could die for us there
[54:50] were many as the scripture would say
[54:52] holy men of old but the men were not
[54:55] holy come on but what it was it was the
[54:59] Holy Ghost that moved upon those men
[55:03] they were set aside by God but yet none
[55:07] of them even if they themselves would
[55:10] have given their life and they did give
[55:13] their life in order that the prophecy
[55:17] would be expressed of the coming
[55:19] Redeemer but yet they themselves did not
[55:22] have what was needed in order to pay the
[55:26] price you see God has made a requirement
[55:30] and when God makes a requirement like
[55:33] this then Italy it puts us in a place to
[55:36] where there is nothing that can be done
[55:39] except God Himself step on the scene and
[55:43] that's what he said clear back there in
[55:45] Genesis 3 after the fall after the fall
[55:48] had taken place yet God steps on the
[55:50] scene and it promises the woman he says
[55:53] I will give he said I will give you a
[55:57] seed and God was making a promise of a
[56:01] coming Redeemer and he said and he said
[56:03] within that that there would be enmity
[56:06] and he says that this seed it would this
[56:10] seed would receive the bruise in its
[56:12] heel but yet it would bruise the head of
[56:16] the seed of the serpent so it was a
[56:19] promise that this promise of the Messiah
[56:21] in that head that means of a ruling
[56:24] power a ruling authority so if there's
[56:27] only one that can overthrow this rule
[56:30] within your life within my life and that
[56:33] is Christ Himself coming and paying the
[56:36] price that then he might work to bring
[56:40] you an eye unto himself so to think of
[56:44] it that the Holy Spirit would move upon
[56:47] the profits move upon many of them and
[56:49] the Holy Spirit would take them they
[56:51] would be used of God they would they
[56:54] would act out their lives whether spoken
[56:56] out prophecy here or their lives just
[56:58] acted out in prophecy God Himself it was
[57:02] all declaring of one event and that was
[57:05] the coming of the Messiah and pointing
[57:08] to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[57:10] which was there the Ministry of the
[57:15] receiving of that sacrifice now coming
[57:18] back upon the worshiper so within this
[57:22] to remember as we were looking at this
[57:24] that he had become he became obedient
[57:27] unto death the death of the Cross and as
[57:29] we were looking at this that many many
[57:32] times that what is focused on is just
[57:34] the cross but remember before he ever
[57:38] died there on the cross there already
[57:42] was a death that take place before that
[57:45] ever manifested there there had to be
[57:47] something within that would take place
[57:50] there was a death dying completely to
[57:54] self and once you think of this the Lord
[57:57] Jesus he here he was he come down walked
[58:01] among us he was not of a sinful nature
[58:03] he was made in the likeness of sinful
[58:06] flesh but his nature was a lamb
[58:09] nature want you to think of this his
[58:13] nature was a lamb nature from the
[58:15] beginning you and I when we came into
[58:18] this world
[58:19] here we have a nature that is against
[58:23] God but underneath there is a lamb
[58:26] nature so there's no one that could take
[58:30] care of this first nature this old meant
[58:33] nothing could do away with this but
[58:36] there was one who could come to stand in
[58:39] our stead in order that we might come
[58:43] back to God he had to die to his own
[58:47] will you see it could not have been
[58:49] anything for stiii I know that simple
[58:53] but I want you to think of this because
[58:54] this is not something that he could be
[58:57] made to do but there was a conference
[59:00] that was called in Gethsemane and there
[59:02] was all that was gathered around and and
[59:05] like we said last week was Samson where
[59:07] Samson stood there in the midst of that
[59:09] time and he's led between those two
[59:12] pillars there was all sorts of the
[59:15] Philistines gathered all around and in
[59:17] the midst of the temple of their God and
[59:20] no wonder Jesus could say it's now that
[59:23] the prince of this world shall be judged
[59:25] he was declaring I'm getting ready to go
[59:28] to what is supporting this all and and
[59:31] I'm getting ready to reconcile all
[59:33] things I'm getting I'm going there to
[59:35] make a payment and you know there was
[59:37] Philistines all around but there in the
[59:40] Garden of Gethsemane there was every
[59:42] demon that was gathered or every demon
[59:45] that had ever bothered men the demon of
[59:47] lust and all of these other demons that
[59:50] were all around and they were there and
[59:52] and the pressure was on and here was a
[59:54] conference that was being held three
[59:57] times he prays if it's possible let this
[1:00:01] cup pass from me he knew there was
[1:00:06] nobody else could take that cup but he
[1:00:09] asked if it's possible let it pass from
[1:00:11] me and then we find it here three times
[1:00:15] it takes place what what is it that
[1:00:17] we're seeing here we're seeing the lamb
[1:00:21] die we're seeing the lamb being
[1:00:25] surrendering his life surrendering his
[1:00:28] rights you know he had a
[1:00:29] to live he got a right to a wife he had
[1:00:34] a right to home he had all of these
[1:00:36] rights yes sir but he forfeited those
[1:00:40] rights his life listened as a lamb his
[1:00:44] life was a life of forfeiture of his own
[1:00:48] will for the will of the Father you
[1:00:51] didn't listen now you didn't get easier
[1:00:54] but with the magnitude of the purpose
[1:00:57] for his coming on earth
[1:00:59] it didn't get easier it grew harder but
[1:01:03] yet listen what he was ordained and
[1:01:06] purposed to do he was predestinated for
[1:01:10] that and I want you to watch this
[1:01:11] predestination it wasn't just by pushing
[1:01:14] in the pipe and pulling him through the
[1:01:17] pipe but the lamb was free to make his
[1:01:21] own choice
[1:01:22] you with me that's overcoming here is
[1:01:25] where the lamb overcame in the Garden of
[1:01:29] Gethsemane
[1:01:30] it's where that he surrendered his will
[1:01:33] and let go of his will that he might be
[1:01:38] obedient to the Father's will it wants
[1:01:43] you to watch how Paul places this here
[1:01:46] let's just start in this just a little
[1:01:47] bit this morning in cautions 121 going
[1:01:51] on Paul says it like this he says and
[1:01:55] you that were sometime alienated and
[1:02:01] enemies in your mind by wicked works yet
[1:02:06] now hath he reconciled
[1:02:11] what's your watch out Paul is dealing
[1:02:13] and you who were enemies in your mind by
[1:02:17] wicked works he's not talking about this
[1:02:19] matter appear the mind it says this
[1:02:22] isn't the scriptures times were in the
[1:02:23] scripture the mind is speaking truly of
[1:02:26] our thoughts but this mind it's speaking
[1:02:28] of that nature our soul we were
[1:02:31] alienated and we could not come into the
[1:02:35] presence of God do you realize Gentiles
[1:02:38] could not come into the presence of God
[1:02:41] even when they took
[1:02:43] city baron jericho grab and her family
[1:02:47] could not come directly into israel the
[1:02:50] had to be a marriage there had to be a
[1:02:56] union that would bring her into Israel
[1:03:02] there was even against the Moabites God
[1:03:06] spoke concerning them all bites and what
[1:03:09] had taken place there with Moab you you
[1:03:12] recall perhaps the story and God here
[1:03:15] even when he sins Israel to go forth and
[1:03:19] they're gonna smite more Moab but I want
[1:03:21] you to notice they didn't white Moab out
[1:03:25] because why there was a seed that was
[1:03:28] going to come out of there
[1:03:30] she though in her flesh would be known
[1:03:33] as ruth the moabite us why that was for
[1:03:36] you and me but down beneath there there
[1:03:39] was a seed there was a nature that God
[1:03:43] Himself was coming for and she was in
[1:03:47] the lineage and genealogy of the Lord
[1:03:49] Jesus Christ declared there in the mind
[1:03:53] of God but here upon earth she declares
[1:03:56] her position in his mind in his word is
[1:04:00] that how did that declare that because
[1:04:02] she accepted the light and walked in it
[1:04:04] and when she did that she declared I was
[1:04:08] there in his mind so how God would place
[1:04:13] these things we were alienated and we
[1:04:16] were enemies you mean we could set read
[1:04:20] the word listen to the message no and
[1:04:21] yet be enemies
[1:04:22] yes alienated because listen friends it
[1:04:26] took it took one to come and be able to
[1:04:31] bring you and I back to God there's only
[1:04:35] one thing that will keep you and I that
[1:04:36] will keep a person separated it's that
[1:04:38] first nature woo glory be to God
[1:04:45] alienated not able to come into the
[1:04:49] blessing and the notice he it we could
[1:04:52] not get there we couldn't do this but he
[1:04:54] came
[1:04:56] God came down and he spanned the breach
[1:05:00] here Mina he spanned the breach there
[1:05:04] was a chasm between God and man and
[1:05:07] there had to be one that could fill that
[1:05:09] space and be able to put his hand on man
[1:05:13] and a holy God there had to be one that
[1:05:17] would span that breach for you and I God
[1:05:20] came down the think of this here God
[1:05:23] becoming one of us in verse 22 in the
[1:05:26] body of his flesh this is how he had
[1:05:30] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:05:32] through death
[1:05:35] the disciples were walking with him but
[1:05:39] they hadn't been reconciled the payment
[1:05:42] hadn't even been made for them to be
[1:05:43] reconciled you see he had to he had to
[1:05:46] die there had to be a death there had to
[1:05:49] be an offering there had to be an
[1:05:50] atonement a perpetuation given through
[1:05:55] death to present you holy and
[1:06:00] unblameable and Unruh provable in his
[1:06:04] sight so who is the you that he recited
[1:06:08] that he reconciled who is the you that
[1:06:11] he's presenting holy unblameable Unruh
[1:06:14] provable in his sight that you is the
[1:06:18] real you that Lamb nature that was
[1:06:22] hidden beneath that first nature Christ
[1:06:28] did not come to make the first nature -
[1:06:32] to dress this guy up where you list me
[1:06:34] now he didn't come where there was a
[1:06:36] bottle that was torn and and he's going
[1:06:38] to put a nice patch on that bottle if he
[1:06:40] would put that patch on the bottle it
[1:06:42] takes away the rip takes away you can't
[1:06:46] put new wine into old bottles see the
[1:06:49] Ministry of the Lord Jesus is declaring
[1:06:52] this there has to be a new birth glory
[1:06:58] be to God now look at this verse 23 if
[1:07:01] you continue in the faith grounded and
[1:07:05] saddled and be not moved away from the
[1:07:09] hope
[1:07:09] the gospel which ye have heard and which
[1:07:12] was preached to every creature which is
[1:07:14] under heaven where of I Paul am made a
[1:07:16] minister so there there must be a
[1:07:18] continuance in what he has done the way
[1:07:22] that he has opened the Bible look at
[1:07:25] this the Bible says and when he Jesus
[1:07:27] come he said I am the way the truth and
[1:07:31] the life so there is a way now where we
[1:07:35] were alienated and closed off but now
[1:07:37] the way has been opened up and just stay
[1:07:41] out and just look at the way and say
[1:07:43] Maya thank God for the way you must have
[1:07:45] come in the way you must move in the way
[1:07:48] Strait is the gate
[1:07:51] right Str AIT it's a water gate strait
[1:07:55] is the gate you repent and be baptized
[1:07:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:01] your sacrifice come on somebody it don't
[1:08:05] do it's not good enough just to look at
[1:08:07] the way you must enter in you gotta
[1:08:13] enter in you got to continue in the
[1:08:15] notice can continuing in the faith
[1:08:17] remember when there were those who
[1:08:19] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:08:21] remember what he said to them he says if
[1:08:24] you continue in my word then are you my
[1:08:28] disciples indeed there's a continuances
[1:08:32] there's no stopping you must walk on in
[1:08:36] the way mine let's just move on
[1:08:42] Hebrews 2:17 wherefore in all things it
[1:08:48] behooves him to be made like unto his
[1:08:52] brethren that he might be a merciful and
[1:08:55] faithful high priest in things
[1:08:58] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:09:02] for the sins of the people
[1:09:06] now keep to keep that in mind when he
[1:09:10] came and remember coming up on the River
[1:09:14] Jordan the Dove is descending down but
[1:09:17] the death will not unite with a wolf I
[1:09:20] want you to keep that we've been working
[1:09:22] that
[1:09:23] working that the Dove will not unite
[1:09:25] with the wolf the Dove does not drive
[1:09:27] the wolf away right it has to be to
[1:09:34] where that the Dove will unite with the
[1:09:37] lamb now they think about were you an
[1:09:39] hour out here you and I in a place
[1:09:41] walking around with the wolf's nature
[1:09:45] there is nothing that could be done to
[1:09:48] bring us to a place of lamb to where
[1:09:52] that lamb nature is underneath but
[1:09:54] there's nothing that could have told
[1:09:56] that could even then bring us to a place
[1:09:58] to where that we can become a lamb in
[1:10:01] order for him to unite with us there
[1:10:06] right because he will unite he unites
[1:10:09] with himself is that true he unites with
[1:10:14] himself the word unites with the word
[1:10:18] right the Holy Spirit unites with the
[1:10:21] word upon whom they'll see the spirit
[1:10:23] descending and remaining the same as he
[1:10:28] glory be to God aren't you thankful
[1:10:32] aren't you glad that you don't have to
[1:10:34] live an up-and-down life you don't have
[1:10:37] to live an in and out lies you can be
[1:10:39] grounded and settled amen you can be
[1:10:42] established in Christ he Ephesians
[1:10:46] chapter 2 verse 14 for he oh my he is
[1:10:51] our peace who hath made both one and has
[1:10:58] broken down the middle wall of partition
[1:11:00] between us a place to where that only
[1:11:07] the high priest could enter in to that
[1:11:09] Tabernacle once a year speaking of
[1:11:12] Christ he would enter in once with his
[1:11:15] own blood but notice there was a
[1:11:17] separation we were alienated but there
[1:11:23] had to be a reconciling notice before
[1:11:26] Calvary
[1:11:27] before there could ever be a Calvary as
[1:11:29] we said it couldn't just be a holy man
[1:11:31] or
[1:11:31] profit or whatever more there was no one
[1:11:34] that was worthy it had to be one of like
[1:11:37] nature so God himself provided a body of
[1:11:44] blood cell it's God providing a body for
[1:11:48] himself to come down and there at the
[1:11:51] River Jordan was a reconciling God was
[1:11:55] reconciled back to man the Lord Jesus
[1:11:58] himself was the representation of all of
[1:12:02] the sons and daughters that were already
[1:12:04] here upon the earth and those that would
[1:12:07] be upon the earth he was the
[1:12:10] representation of that that coming of
[1:12:12] the Lord was a representation of when
[1:12:15] the Holy Spirit itself would come up on
[1:12:19] the believer because the Holy Ghost will
[1:12:22] come and claim its sons and daughters
[1:12:28] there had to be a reconciling so there
[1:12:31] had to be this reconciling first and he
[1:12:35] had broken down the middle wall of
[1:12:37] partition between us having abolished in
[1:12:42] his flesh the enmity he abolished in his
[1:12:47] flesh the enmity the war the strife all
[1:12:51] that was there that first birth your
[1:12:54] first birth my first birth is enmity
[1:12:57] against God that first birth is a
[1:13:00] product between Satan and Eve it is a
[1:13:05] product not of the perfect will of God
[1:13:08] but the permissive will of God because
[1:13:11] God is life is that right
[1:13:13] God is not death there is no death in
[1:13:15] him he's light he is life
[1:13:19] but suddenly we look at this he
[1:13:21] abolished in his flesh so it had to come
[1:13:24] in such a manner to where God himself as
[1:13:28] we read in an earlier verse he he came
[1:13:31] and became one of us oh my how I think
[1:13:35] God for that he became one of us he had
[1:13:39] to in order to abolish the enmity even
[1:13:42] the law of commandments
[1:13:44] it's contained in ordinances for to make
[1:13:47] in himself of twain one new man so
[1:13:52] making peace this is this is the
[1:13:59] privilege this is now by redemption to
[1:14:03] where God now steps forward and we hear
[1:14:08] the declaration these two are now one
[1:14:13] hallelujah bowling my bone flesh of my
[1:14:16] flesh life of his life no longer to you
[1:14:20] see it's in our Christian is not one
[1:14:22] living two separate lives
[1:14:25] no cell not two separate life it is a
[1:14:28] life that has identified in Christ
[1:14:31] it's where Christ Himself has taken us
[1:14:35] unto himself and don't you we see it's
[1:14:38] not us receiving him it's him
[1:14:40] bringing us to the place to where he
[1:14:43] receives us we cannot make ourselves
[1:14:46] receivable the same you only have to
[1:14:50] repent we do but who is it the leads us
[1:14:53] to repentance the goodness of God
[1:14:56] leadeth or to repentance who is it that
[1:14:59] st. defines us his blood the right we
[1:15:04] have access to that who is that then
[1:15:06] moves upon a life who is it that's
[1:15:07] drawing us it's him it's not us coming
[1:15:12] to a place of receiving him it's him
[1:15:14] receiving us the wonder brother Brown
[1:15:18] was saying earlier I met part of the
[1:15:19] message and then in future home don't
[1:15:20] say he said you should not say I
[1:15:22] received the Holy Ghost he said you
[1:15:24] should say the Holy Ghost has received
[1:15:26] me glory be to God we were all guilty
[1:15:32] who think of this God Himself came down
[1:15:35] born of a woman he took his own laws
[1:15:40] upon himself and lived by those laws he
[1:15:44] didn't destroy the law come on
[1:15:47] they thought he was doing away with the
[1:15:49] law they thought he was against the law
[1:15:52] he wasn't this was the fulfillment of
[1:15:55] the law this
[1:15:57] was where the same God who gave the law
[1:15:59] the law giver himself was now dwelling
[1:16:03] there and giving an understanding of
[1:16:06] what the law was really all about here
[1:16:09] he was he took his own laws you know
[1:16:12] what you know in the Lord Jesus if you
[1:16:14] just take time and study this I don't
[1:16:15] have time to dwell on it but there's so
[1:16:17] much in the scripture to look at that
[1:16:18] statement we took his own laws on
[1:16:20] himself and live by he lived by what he
[1:16:23] said he lived by the word he just didn't
[1:16:26] give you another word and tell us a new
[1:16:29] commandment I write unto you that you
[1:16:31] would love one another even as I love
[1:16:33] you he just didn't give us these things
[1:16:34] he just did not look back at
[1:16:36] Commandments and and tell us to forgive
[1:16:38] one another
[1:16:38] he himself manifested his own law clear
[1:16:43] to the very part of even where the life
[1:16:47] left his body he took his own laws and
[1:16:53] he lived by them
[1:16:54] he came he himself came down that he
[1:16:59] might redeem you and I who were under
[1:17:02] the curse of the law he who was innocent
[1:17:05] the innocent one came down oh ma I think
[1:17:10] of how Paul says it like this he said he
[1:17:12] didn't do a way with the law but now the
[1:17:15] law is established the law is
[1:17:18] established he didn't do away with it
[1:17:20] but now that law is established because
[1:17:22] now in the hearts of the believer those
[1:17:26] that have been born of the Spirit of God
[1:17:28] that law remember the law those tablets
[1:17:31] were in the ark and the ark was taken
[1:17:34] into the presence of God and there there
[1:17:36] was the cherubims the anointing and the
[1:17:38] Shekinah glory that word itself it finds
[1:17:42] its mark in the lives of the believer
[1:17:45] and therefore Paul could say that we
[1:17:48] find the Gentiles that they do by nature
[1:17:50] those things that are written in the law
[1:17:54] knew by nature we couldn't have done it
[1:17:56] under our first nature there has to be
[1:18:01] another nature that is pression that God
[1:18:04] raises up one that is dead that he must
[1:18:07] raise up the head life before
[1:18:12] glory be to God that he might reconcile
[1:18:17] both unto God in one body by the cross
[1:18:21] having slain the enmity thereby and came
[1:18:26] and preached peace to you which were
[1:18:28] afar off and to them that were nine oh
[1:18:33] my the purpose that we might be
[1:18:36] reconciled in that one body he made a
[1:18:40] way he made a way that you and I might
[1:18:44] be able to die let's say brother Samuel
[1:18:48] I ain't even made plans for my funeral
[1:18:50] I'm not talking about your natural body
[1:18:52] I'm talking about your soul I'm talking
[1:18:57] about that first nature that old man he
[1:19:01] made a way that that and first nature
[1:19:05] could die Lord would be to God it
[1:19:11] couldn't do it before there wasn't
[1:19:13] anything there wasn't released by access
[1:19:18] what was needed in order to break down
[1:19:21] that first nature you take a seed you
[1:19:27] put a sea now and well we've got a lot
[1:19:29] of rain out here it's a good time if you
[1:19:30] planted grass or planted some
[1:19:32] landscaping and things like that is a
[1:19:34] good time and we got rain coming to rest
[1:19:36] this week but if you take a seed and you
[1:19:41] put that seed in dirt you don't water it
[1:19:44] it'll still lay there a seed well I'm
[1:19:50] waiting on tomato plants if water don't
[1:19:52] get to it it'll lay there but the water
[1:19:59] must first get to it
[1:20:01] because that water will break it down I
[1:20:04] don't care how much Sun is on it if
[1:20:08] water don't get to it
[1:20:13] water finds its way through the earth
[1:20:16] come on now you don't got to bring the
[1:20:19] seed up to the surface and water it the
[1:20:22] seed is there buried in the earth and
[1:20:25] the water will find the seed and the
[1:20:29] seed catches like joe said the scent of
[1:20:32] water hallelujah and what does the water
[1:20:36] do begin the process of rot but the germ
[1:20:43] that's there on the inside can come
[1:20:46] forth hollow he has abolished in his
[1:20:52] flesh he hath made a way that you and I
[1:20:55] who were playing now we might become one
[1:20:59] he made a way are you with me the brat
[1:21:03] does not enter the bride does not enter
[1:21:06] in here first to be married it is the
[1:21:08] groom who enters in here first because
[1:21:11] the groom is the initiator of the
[1:21:13] Covenant it's his name she's receiving
[1:21:20] she is receiving she has received of his
[1:21:24] advances where he has had you know and
[1:21:27] been courting her reached out to her she
[1:21:30] has responded to that come on somebody
[1:21:32] they hit do the back don't come here and
[1:21:34] stand here and say well you know I don't
[1:21:36] I don't know how I don't know I mean you
[1:21:39] know hey hold on me
[1:21:40] preacher hold on it's like what you say

[1:21:49] okay well have my own checking account
[1:21:51] how much your god I would just stand up
[1:21:58] and say everybody dismissed because this
[1:22:02] is going to be a failure how you can you
[1:22:06] say that cuz it's all about one side
[1:22:09] whoa you can't enter into the union when
[1:22:14] it's about self neither listen to me now
[1:22:19] neither even when it comes to the
[1:22:21] natural union neither is it the groom
[1:22:24] looking at it in the manner and say well
[1:22:26] you know she's so sorry I'm gonna help
[1:22:27] her out I'm gonna lift her up you know I
[1:22:29] mean look at her I mean she you know
[1:22:31] Carly can't even match her clothes right
[1:22:32] and I I'm gonna help her out here I'm
[1:22:34] gonna no sir that's wrong he made
[1:22:38] himself of no reputation he that he
[1:22:43] couldn't he could not he doesn't come
[1:22:45] here and unite you and I with pride in
[1:22:48] the beginning the first Union came by
[1:22:51] pride when Satan here through the
[1:22:55] vehicle of a serpent he began to present
[1:22:57] to eat yeah God's errand and you know
[1:23:00] you you shall be as God's when you you
[1:23:03] were partake of this what's he doing
[1:23:04] elevating her pride that Union produced
[1:23:10] a king here with me he produced the Cain
[1:23:14] and because of that where each and every
[1:23:17] one of us come into this world we are as
[1:23:20] the Bible says in Psalms 51 born in sin
[1:23:23] shaped in iniquity job said and Joe 14
[1:23:30] ugly verse 5 he said Who how can an
[1:23:33] unclean bring forth clean but you see
[1:23:37] here the bridegroom himself stepping
[1:23:41] forward how did he himself the Bible
[1:23:44] says in first Peter 3:18 for Christ also
[1:23:47] had suffered for sins the just for the
[1:23:50] unjust that he might bring us to God
[1:23:53] being put to death in the flesh but
[1:23:56] quickened by the spirit and Isaiah 63
[1:24:02] verse 1 oh my I love this here has a ax
[1:24:08] picked up here it is utter doubt who is
[1:24:13] this that cometh from Edom with dyed
[1:24:16] garments from Bullock Bossier this that
[1:24:20] is glorious and here's a pair of peril
[1:24:24] traveling in the greatness of history
[1:24:27] that were traveling means that the scowl
[1:24:29] he has stooped and convinced indeed I
[1:24:34] that speak in righteousness
[1:24:37] mighty to save this is who it is I that
[1:24:41] speak in righteousness and mighty to
[1:24:43] save wherefore art thou read Adama
[1:24:51] wherefore off out read in dine apparel
[1:24:55] he became one of us
[1:25:00] wherefore art thou tread in thine
[1:25:03] apparel and thy garments like him that
[1:25:07] treadeth in the wine fat notice the
[1:25:10] detail the detail is caught here is one
[1:25:13] like you and I may like unto his
[1:25:16] brethren made in the likeness of sinful
[1:25:18] flesh but yet he himself Lamb nature he
[1:25:21] never had to repent but notice now he
[1:25:24] goes and he's going to tread the
[1:25:26] winepress of God's wrath it's recognized
[1:25:33] he's one of us and his garments his
[1:25:37] garments his vesture what the devil
[1:25:41] scoffed at what calluses and the rest of
[1:25:45] him scoffed at it said if you're him
[1:25:47] come down off the cross save yourself
[1:25:51] but if he would have saved himself he
[1:25:55] couldn't have saved others or let that
[1:25:59] go deep let that go deep that life of
[1:26:03] Christ in you and me it does not make
[1:26:07] you selfish it makes you lose sight of
[1:26:12] yourself and we must be reminded of that
[1:26:18] we must be reminded of that and raised
[1:26:22] up within that notice I have trodden the
[1:26:25] winepress alone and of the people there
[1:26:30] was none with me think of this the Sun
[1:26:35] refused to shine no the moon would not
[1:26:42] give her light as her greater as quick
[1:26:45] even as he was there he cries out my God
[1:26:51] my God why hast thou forsaken me he
[1:26:57] cries out like a sinner he didn't say my
[1:27:03] father my father why has thou forsaken
[1:27:06] me my God my God because he could not
[1:27:13] remain a son and make you and I who were
[1:27:19] sinners sons but he became sin he died
[1:27:29] he died not as a son he died as a sinner
[1:27:35] spilled into lay still was a lamb nature
[1:27:38] he poured out his soul as an offering
[1:27:43] for death
[1:27:44] there was no soul that was upon the
[1:27:47] earth none could do this but while the
[1:27:50] rest of them every said for weeks the
[1:27:52] rest of them were scoffing and they were
[1:27:54] looking at what was taking place on
[1:27:56] Calvary but God was looking down and
[1:28:01] said he shall see the travail of his
[1:28:05] soul and be satisfied listen now it
[1:28:12] wasn't the anguish of all that could
[1:28:15] come out here it was not it was not that
[1:28:19] that just that position of his body
[1:28:21] it was the condition of his soul that
[1:28:25] God was looking at you understand what
[1:28:29] I'm saying God looks at the condition of
[1:28:32] our soul it doesn't matter friends how
[1:28:35] much we cry listen you understand I'm
[1:28:37] not taking away from that I just want
[1:28:39] you to see that God is looking there on
[1:28:42] the inside and God is dealing with the
[1:28:45] inside man
[1:28:50] I don't believe in Dryad repentance I
[1:28:53] just don't believe in it for the salmon
[1:28:59] you don't believe in it I don't know how
[1:29:01] you can I don't know how you can repent
[1:29:02] and not break you up I don't stand that
[1:29:06] oh I need scripture for that well I'm
[1:29:09] glad you asked us he just dropped the
[1:29:13] Bible said when Noah preached the
[1:29:15] message of repentance here is God giving
[1:29:19] an announcement but there is going to
[1:29:21] come a way of repentance this was only
[1:29:24] in time but notice the Bible says that
[1:29:27] when he had ministered that message The
[1:29:29] Fountains of the deep were broken up the
[1:29:37] deep that which was within it's a
[1:29:41] repentance not something that you come
[1:29:43] out of fear but it's where God has dealt
[1:29:47] with your heart God has dealt with your
[1:29:55] heart noticed this let's look at this
[1:29:57] here just a few moments he tread that
[1:30:00] winepress of the wrath of God alone I
[1:30:03] didn't put this up but just let me read
[1:30:04] it alone how do you must be born again
[1:30:06] alone he walked the road alone he died
[1:30:09] with not no help from an angel from a
[1:30:12] man from his church from his mother from
[1:30:15] his brethren from his father and
[1:30:16] forsaken by God man and nature he died
[1:30:20] alone to show us that even nature itself
[1:30:23] can't help us in the hour of death no
[1:30:29] one was there but I got great news
[1:30:37] he walked that way so you don't ever
[1:30:41] have to know
[1:30:43] loneliness
[1:30:46] you don't ever have to know this his
[1:30:50] promise and his word that he desires and
[1:30:54] makes real and desires to make real to
[1:30:56] your heart is I'll never leave you nor
[1:30:58] forsake you now the only way how this
[1:31:02] promise I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:31:04] you it has to be a lamb nature that he
[1:31:07] can unite with and seal because when
[1:31:11] he's sealed you're sealed until the day
[1:31:15] of redemption notice this in numbers 21
[1:31:22] here was a situation that arose within
[1:31:26] the camp there within that of the Israel
[1:31:30] here and remember the Bible says in
[1:31:33] numbers 21 7 the people came to know
[1:31:35] Moses and they said we've sinned for we
[1:31:37] have spoken against the Lord and against
[1:31:40] thee pray unto the Lord that he take
[1:31:42] away the Serpent's from us and Moses
[1:31:46] prayed for the people and the Lord said
[1:31:50] unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and
[1:31:54] set it on a pole and it shall come to
[1:31:57] pass that every one that is bitten we
[1:31:59] need to look at the pond it shall live
[1:32:01] notice make thee a fiery Serpent he
[1:32:05] never said take one of the fiery
[1:32:07] serpents that's running around because
[1:32:11] one that was already here could not
[1:32:13] atone but there's got to be one made
[1:32:18] make thee a fiery Serpent why a serpent
[1:32:23] it's representing sin sin being judged
[1:32:28] make thee a fiery serpent don't reach on
[1:32:31] the ground and take one but make v1 whoo
[1:32:35] glory hallelujah and Moses made a
[1:32:40] serpent of brass and put it up on a pole
[1:32:47] that pole is called a standard a banner
[1:32:51] and in sign
[1:32:53] huko ever could see it look and live
[1:32:58] now right and it came to pass look at
[1:33:01] this it came to pass that if a serpent
[1:33:04] had bitten any man when he beheld the
[1:33:07] serpent of brass he lived I want you to
[1:33:11] watch now there was a need among the
[1:33:14] people they had sinned but notice how
[1:33:19] that Moses steps in to intercede on
[1:33:22] their behalf what was that in Moses the
[1:33:25] Spirit of Christ he steps in and he
[1:33:28] intercedes and notice a word is revealed
[1:33:32] and then the word that is revealed
[1:33:34] becomes substance and when the word
[1:33:37] becomes substance that word becomes an
[1:33:40] atonement for the people hallelujah all
[1:33:45] the way down through the Old Testament
[1:33:47] what was written in the heavens all that
[1:33:49] all the way on down was a word that was
[1:33:52] ministered that was spoken that was
[1:33:54] speaking of a coming Redeemer and that
[1:33:56] word itself that word became all wrapped
[1:34:00] up in the person of Jesus Christ as our
[1:34:03] atonement but whosoever here is God as a
[1:34:07] prophet on the scene and there's a need
[1:34:10] that arises and the prophet catches the
[1:34:13] inspiration and the word drops in that
[1:34:15] kind and the people now are not just
[1:34:18] listening to a word but it is a word
[1:34:20] that is called in the manifestation and
[1:34:23] that word pacts within an atonement
[1:34:27] if pacts within it the ability to remove
[1:34:31] that poison that poison that would
[1:34:35] destroy them it would kill them but
[1:34:39] notice there was one who came down and
[1:34:43] there was going to be some anti-venom
[1:34:47] hello he came down and he got he took a
[1:34:51] shot he took an inoculation in this life
[1:34:55] that was lived in that body here in the
[1:34:59] body of his flesh he abolished the
[1:35:01] enmity there up he took the bite of sin
[1:35:04] he took that bite that thereby back the
[1:35:08] rest who were bitten
[1:35:10] by the first verse but now there is a
[1:35:14] toxin that's able to defeat that first
[1:35:18] birth a toxin that's able to take a care
[1:35:21] of that first nature girl repeat Oh God
[1:35:25] he came down and became bitten he took
[1:35:30] that sting of death in himself for you
[1:35:33] and me why that he might give his life
[1:35:37] to you and I even so as it goes on to
[1:35:44] say the Son of Man must be lifted up oh
[1:35:47] my brother Graham points it out like
[1:35:51] this he said notice in that serpent I
[1:35:54] want you to hang on to this
[1:35:56] he said notice in that serpent there was
[1:35:58] no life in that serpent that serpent was
[1:36:02] not on the pole it was not a serpent
[1:36:04] that was you know moving around on the
[1:36:05] pole you could look at and say ain't
[1:36:08] dead they dead
[1:36:11] but the serpent itself was made out of
[1:36:14] brass brother Graham puts her like this
[1:36:17] it was crystallized there was no
[1:36:22] movement there it was death what was
[1:36:28] that speaking of our death
[1:36:30] our death to the old man he's not just
[1:36:36] hung up to the occasion but he must
[1:36:39] become crystallized dead there's no
[1:36:45] moving around who Romans 5:6 for when we
[1:36:54] were yet without strength in due time
[1:36:57] Christ died for the ungodly aren't you
[1:37:04] glad you me who were enemies in our
[1:37:08] minds by wicked works he died for the
[1:37:12] ungodly
[1:37:14] he was godly died for the ungodly
[1:37:18] he made us the unlovable lovable for
[1:37:25] scarcely for a righteous man will one
[1:37:27] die yet peradventure for a good man some
[1:37:31] would even dare to die but God
[1:37:34] commendeth his love toward us in that
[1:37:36] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:37:41] for us you talking about love his
[1:37:48] confidence would look at this the Lord
[1:37:50] Jesus goes to Calvary where is his
[1:37:53] confidence his confidence is in what the
[1:37:57] word has said about him are you with me
[1:38:01] he endured the cross for the joy that
[1:38:04] was set before he went there wherein it
[1:38:07] all was so resonated within his heart
[1:38:10] destroy this temple and in three days
[1:38:13] I'll raise it up he knew there was
[1:38:15] coming a resurrection is that right but
[1:38:20] the place coming to that place right
[1:38:21] there notice the whole point come into
[1:38:24] that place John well now it's my soul
[1:38:26] troubled what shall I say save me from
[1:38:27] for this hour but for this hour for this
[1:38:30] cause I came into the world
[1:38:31] notice it's coming down it's coming down
[1:38:35] to the crowning of his ministry it's
[1:38:38] coming down the third pole is coming
[1:38:40] into a greater manifestation are you
[1:38:43] with me glory be to God there's got to
[1:38:47] be a dying off it seems like everything
[1:38:49] dies before he can raised it has to be
[1:38:55] within this manner here he himself while
[1:38:59] we were yet sinners
[1:39:08] can you die can I die for that person
[1:39:13] the road Ram says that it would kill you
[1:39:17] if they had the chance
[1:39:21] remember the revenue they don't that
[1:39:23] they own cow versus brother Ram I could
[1:39:25] live for this guy well he's a fine guy
[1:39:27] you know live for that person who I hate
[1:39:31] you can you do that me to say this right
[1:39:38] here your flesh can never do that your
[1:39:42] flesh will kick against that you can
[1:39:46] never reform yourself enough to do that
[1:39:49] but you have access to his life that can
[1:39:55] so move in you and cleanse you from the
[1:40:00] hurt and the sting that is there so that
[1:40:03] you walk in Liberty let me tell you
[1:40:07] something you holding against son
[1:40:09] something against somebody else you're
[1:40:11] not really affecting the other person
[1:40:12] you're causing yourself trouble
[1:40:16] bitterness is where you yourself it's
[1:40:18] like this right here you've got the
[1:40:20] bitterness and you're taking a drink and
[1:40:22] you're maybe I'm bitter at brother Joey
[1:40:27] ain't nothing happened man he's getting
[1:40:29] happier he's getting freer what is it
[1:40:33] who's actually getting killed me I'm the
[1:40:38] one drinking it it's coming up in me and
[1:40:40] yet I'm expected you see what I did
[1:40:42] listen friends these are things that the
[1:40:43] enemy he wants to so deceitfully what's
[1:40:46] he trying to do stifle out that life the
[1:40:51] death of the Lord Jesus made a way
[1:40:54] listen now that you and I could die and
[1:40:57] then through this death it makes a way
[1:40:59] that we can die daily huh constantly
[1:41:04] dying oh yes sir you love me Christ died
[1:41:10] for us much more then being now
[1:41:12] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[1:41:15] from wrath through him through him
[1:41:20] for if when we were enemies my anybody
[1:41:26] liked being labeled an enemy no but
[1:41:32] Paul's letting us know we were enemies
[1:41:35] at one time but you really weren't an
[1:41:40] enemy just you were an enemy there's a
[1:41:46] part of you that was an enemy but
[1:41:49] there's a part of you that was always a
[1:41:51] part of God glory for it when we were
[1:41:58] enemies now watch this verse this is oh
[1:42:00] this is a big verse right here we were
[1:42:03] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:42:08] son there was a payment made there was a
[1:42:15] payment made but he must come and claim
[1:42:19] what he paid the Holy Ghost comes forth
[1:42:25] to claim what he was paid and it lets
[1:42:29] you know you were included in the
[1:42:31] sacrifice glory be to God
[1:42:37] you love him much more being reconciled
[1:42:42] we shall be saved by his wife so even he
[1:42:48] the payment of his life was given that
[1:42:51] he might come and deal with you and I
[1:42:55] and bring us to himself in Redemption
[1:42:59] then the imparting of his life is when
[1:43:03] you've been fully reconciled unto him
[1:43:11] not only so but we also joy in God
[1:43:14] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we
[1:43:17] have now received the atonement said
[1:43:22] Corinthians 5:14
[1:43:24] for the love of christ constraineth us
[1:43:27] because we thus judge that if one died
[1:43:31] for all then we're all dead now wait a
[1:43:35] minute wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:43:37] you're telling me I have to die but yet
[1:43:39] Paul just said all we're dead no there
[1:43:42] was a part of us that was alive but
[1:43:45] there was a part of us that was dead and
[1:43:46] the part that was dead he became dead
[1:43:49] that we might be alive he became dead he
[1:43:54] died that we might die the Horta be to
[1:43:59] God you see how look at this life the
[1:44:02] Lord Jesus himself here's the Lamb
[1:44:04] nature here he is he didn't have to
[1:44:06] repent there didn't have to be you know
[1:44:09] a change of nature no no he was always
[1:44:11] the lamb but notice he died he became as
[1:44:15] you and I were we were dead in sin and
[1:44:18] trespasses he died but then he rose
[1:44:24] again testified there's more in this
[1:44:28] field that's coming glory verse 15 and
[1:44:34] that he died for all that day which live
[1:44:38] should not henceforth live unto
[1:44:39] themselves but unto Him which died for
[1:44:43] them and rose again in that a privilege
[1:44:47] that's a privilege but we don't live for
[1:44:51] ourselves anymore our ambitions listen
[1:44:57] friends God is not interested in taking
[1:44:58] away your dreams or ambitions or other
[1:45:00] things just as long as that's not before
[1:45:03] his word it cannot be before his word or
[1:45:06] contradict his word if you want God if
[1:45:09] you really want the blessing of God you
[1:45:11] say does that mean I can't I can't you
[1:45:13] know fully do this or or Excel right
[1:45:15] here you can Excel if that's what God
[1:45:17] wants you to do in that line of work or
[1:45:19] that workplace or wherever it's at you
[1:45:21] can do that but it ought to me to such a
[1:45:23] place do you recognize that it's not
[1:45:26] about your skills it's not God coming to
[1:45:28] highlight your skills but you are a
[1:45:30] vessel to be used of the Lord
[1:45:33] a vessel where that life is to be
[1:45:36] reflected through it's no longer about
[1:45:38] you you see this is why the preaching of
[1:45:41] the word it
[1:45:42] continues to come to put us in that
[1:45:44] place that our sites do not become
[1:45:46] centered upon this earth remember where
[1:45:51] your site is is where you'll finish if
[1:45:55] your site is on things of this earth
[1:45:57] that's where you'll finish where is your
[1:46:03] site where is your goal where is your
[1:46:06] aim that matters Satan is very
[1:46:12] meticulous he knows how to sew
[1:46:15] intertwine and try to take our time and
[1:46:19] our lives and our thoughts this is why
[1:46:22] friends listen the ministering of the
[1:46:24] word glaucoma's write down and even when
[1:46:28] we have been born again of the Spirit of
[1:46:30] God we need the Holy Spirit coming down
[1:46:33] and putting you and I in remembrance of
[1:46:36] these things this is a love affair it's
[1:46:47] a love affair the message knoweth it not
[1:46:51] I'm trying to get somewhere the Bram
[1:46:55] says this he was the fullness of all of
[1:46:57] you you were in him back yonder at
[1:47:00] Calvary
[1:47:01] this is paragraph 182 he foreknew you
[1:47:05] would be here
[1:47:07] he only broadcast what would take place
[1:47:10] let me hold on second he foreknew let me
[1:47:14] ask you something you go to a pawn shop
[1:47:15] a pawn shop holds something that belongs
[1:47:20] to you are you with me you don't go to
[1:47:24] that pawn shop and lay down a hundred
[1:47:26] dollars and say I wonder what they're
[1:47:28] gonna give me you're with me you don't
[1:47:33] lay that down you go to the pawn shop
[1:47:35] because there's something that has been
[1:47:39] pawned of your own belonging to you and
[1:47:43] you go there with the necessary payment
[1:47:46] to get what belongs to you you with me
[1:47:51] the hundred dollars does not make the
[1:47:54] watch that had to be ponder
[1:47:55] the hundred dollars does not make it
[1:47:58] yours the hundred dollar says this is
[1:48:00] what was required to bring back to me
[1:48:04] that which was lost
[1:48:07] that's Redemption so the Lord Jesus
[1:48:10] Christ
[1:48:11] notice the lamb was slain revelations 13
[1:48:14] before the foundation of the world he
[1:48:16] came down here not hoping that there
[1:48:20] would be people that would feel sorry
[1:48:23] for him
[1:48:23] he came into this world and he laid the
[1:48:29] necessary answer to claim what belonged
[1:48:34] to him even this earth he's claimed he
[1:48:43] baptized it in the days of Noah his
[1:48:46] blood has dripped upon it it's going to
[1:48:50] get a fire baptism leading in in the
[1:48:53] Millennium and then after that here we
[1:48:56] find that after that great volcanic then
[1:49:00] the very future home of Christ himself
[1:49:04] will set down upon this earth he's
[1:49:08] redeeming the earth the same way that
[1:49:12] he's redeemed you and I you say well
[1:49:16] look at their hurt look at look at
[1:49:18] what's going on and you say he's
[1:49:19] redeemed the world know the earth earth
[1:49:23] and world are two different things
[1:49:26] this world he is not of this world so
[1:49:31] what he said I'm not of this world
[1:49:33] there's got to be a change of
[1:49:35] administration there's got to be a
[1:49:40] change of administration in this earth
[1:49:43] and his he has made a way that there
[1:49:47] could be a final change of
[1:49:48] administration to where it even speaks
[1:49:51] in the Millennium in the Book of
[1:49:52] Revelations that the kingdoms of this
[1:49:55] earth have become the kingdoms of our
[1:49:58] Lord and His Christ his sons and
[1:50:03] daughters of God he's anointed him glory
[1:50:07] be to God set out
[1:50:09] they're in the Millennium Oh blessed be
[1:50:13] his name you love him he's made away for
[1:50:16] this
[1:50:18] he made away for this he only look at
[1:50:23] this I got to read this part again he
[1:50:26] foreknew you would be here
[1:50:27] he only broadcast what would take place
[1:50:32] you don't know what a broadcast is it's
[1:50:36] a telling fourth of what's going to take
[1:50:38] place his life was a declaration this is
[1:50:44] what's going to take place
[1:50:45] there's going to be others that come and
[1:50:49] they die to themselves this is an
[1:50:54] announcement that is going forth Calgary
[1:50:57] was an announcement while the devil and
[1:50:59] the rest of them and all the scoffers
[1:51:01] were there but yet on Calvary there was
[1:51:03] prophecy ringing out as his life was
[1:51:06] being given he said I've got more
[1:51:11] brethren glory and you were in him you
[1:51:18] died with him you died to your prize you
[1:51:22] say how could I have died I wasn't even
[1:51:23] alive then if you are a seed of God he
[1:51:26] was all of the word every word he was
[1:51:31] the fullness it pleased the father in
[1:51:33] him should all the fullness dwell
[1:51:35] he was the fullness of the word in what
[1:51:39] we could look there at Calvary we would
[1:51:41] see the book of life amen the Lamb who
[1:51:45] was there we would see every son and
[1:51:49] daughter of God he's identified in that
[1:51:51] sacrifice I want you to watch this here
[1:51:54] as he says this he says you guide to
[1:51:57] your pride you died to your fashions you
[1:52:00] died to the world
[1:52:02] you died with him at Calvary don't you
[1:52:04] see he made a way that you and I could
[1:52:07] die we couldn't die before the rich
[1:52:14] young ruler he came to the Lord Jesus
[1:52:17] good master what must I do to have
[1:52:21] eternal life
[1:52:22] and the Lord Jesus looking upon him he
[1:52:24] loved him he said thou knowest go keep
[1:52:28] the commandments he said I have from my
[1:52:31] youth up if that man was lying he'd have
[1:52:34] been called out on it but it's sho just
[1:52:37] keeping the commandments that's not
[1:52:39] redemption I'm gonna say it tight just
[1:52:44] being around this message is not
[1:52:45] redemption just being able to quote it
[1:52:49] just being able to sit around it it's
[1:52:51] not Redemption there's got to be a death
[1:52:54] the real reality this message leads you
[1:52:58] this is God's life leading you tonight
[1:53:00] to a death what must I do go sell what
[1:53:08] thou hast see what he touched the Spirit
[1:53:14] of God got down and touched what he
[1:53:16] valued now Vita told him go sell that
[1:53:21] that car that's old rusty and whatever
[1:53:22] more go sell that no problem y'all met

[1:53:34] that's not what he wanted go sell all
[1:53:39] thou hast and give to the poor Oh Lord
[1:53:43] you want me to start a charity
[1:53:45] organization oh and make fruit baskets
[1:53:49] for people that's so you want me to take
[1:53:51] all of my money and give all of my money
[1:53:54] to make baskets for people and now God
[1:53:57] don't want his money he didn't want his
[1:54:00] money he wanted his life but you see his
[1:54:06] life was intertwined with his substance
[1:54:10] his substance was his life his substance
[1:54:14] though he walked under the commandments
[1:54:16] but his substance was his God come on
[1:54:20] he gave oblations to it Oh Lord a mercy
[1:54:24] listen how can you say this look look in
[1:54:28] the midst of the time instead of
[1:54:29] surrendering and dying he walks
[1:54:32] away if his heart he's discouraged
[1:54:37] grieved because he had many possessions
[1:54:41] but remember your possessions no matter
[1:54:45] how great they are no matter how much
[1:54:48] they are can never bring you peace and
[1:54:51] will never be there to comfort you in
[1:54:53] the hour of your dad's death you are not
[1:54:56] redeemed by silver and gold but redeemed
[1:54:59] by the precious blood of the Lamb
[1:55:03] hallelujah dying there notice all he
[1:55:07] says he rose again on that third day and
[1:55:10] because you've accepted it now you are
[1:55:13] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:55:16] Jesus all he said there you are
[1:55:18] it's that inside man that inside that
[1:55:21] will punctuate the word and hang with
[1:55:23] the word regardless you can't help it
[1:55:29] all the brothers and I Oh what did what
[1:55:36] I is that but brother Samuel I know the
[1:55:40] word what I is that is that the first
[1:55:44] nature or is that a new nature the first
[1:55:48] nature can quote the word real good
[1:55:50] the first nature can be a great worker
[1:55:53] who know when that life has been
[1:56:01] quickened you can't help it no Samuel
[1:56:09] he's not gonna push me through a pipe
[1:56:10] and pull him out I know I'm glad you
[1:56:11] remember that quote from the first part
[1:56:13] of the service that's exactly right
[1:56:14] but what is within you is made in
[1:56:17] contact with him and it's able to be
[1:56:19] touched and able to be drawn and when
[1:56:23] the Prophet stood right there in the
[1:56:25] midst of that time and when the enemy
[1:56:27] came right up against him came right in
[1:56:28] his mind rattled his spiritual cage his
[1:56:32] reasoning he said everything he was
[1:56:35] saying at that time was the truth
[1:56:39] and I was about ready to say if that's
[1:56:45] the way he's going to be but he said Oh
[1:56:49] think if that new birth hadn't been
[1:56:53] there if that Holy Ghost had not been
[1:56:57] there that tight Aust see where he gave
[1:57:01] credit he didn't give credit to any
[1:57:04] stalker well I got this from the
[1:57:05] branham's I'll tell you were real strong
[1:57:06] people were resolute no branham's would
[1:57:08] have caved come on you put your last
[1:57:11] name in there too this is not about the
[1:57:13] stocks of your genealogy no sir this is
[1:57:16] about him him lifting up his own jeans
[1:57:23] glory dude Oh God
[1:57:24] you love him here he is in his life nah
[1:57:30] I don't know where time goes to let me
[1:57:36] let me let me close on this in the
[1:57:40] message on the wings of a snow white
[1:57:41] dove brother bream has just mentioned
[1:57:46] here right before this quote brother
[1:57:50] Lyle had asked him a question said
[1:57:55] brother Branham I guess the messages
[1:57:56] like lamb and a dove you don't you don't
[1:57:58] get to them the kind of messages anymore
[1:57:59] he said with what you've got
[1:58:00] but the bream says if I get away from
[1:58:03] that I've missed my message see that was
[1:58:09] only prophetic when he spoke the lamb
[1:58:12] and the dove notice how the Spirit of
[1:58:14] God was calling out to the people to be
[1:58:18] a lamb why because the word that was
[1:58:20] going to be coming born into existence
[1:58:24] could not unite with off it had to unite
[1:58:30] with the lamb
[1:58:32] remember the declaration of the
[1:58:35] messenger the Prophet said this
[1:58:37] messenger will be pointing the people to
[1:58:40] a word born bride and he will point them
[1:58:45] to the
[1:58:47] of the Simon I said how beautiful it's
[1:58:54] typed here is Jesus being the Lamb and
[1:58:56] God being the dove and the Dove would
[1:58:58] not have settled on a wolf his nature is
[1:59:01] not right it couldn't have settled on a
[1:59:03] dog his nature's not right it had to be
[1:59:06] on a lamb the two nature's had to be the
[1:59:10] same and that's the way we have to be
[1:59:13] our natures has to change from the
[1:59:17] roaring sinner to the meekness of a lamb
[1:59:24] our natures has to change or how could
[1:59:31] we ever get there how could we ever get
[1:59:34] to a place to where that our natures
[1:59:36] could come into a place that he could
[1:59:37] actually unite with us he's the way he's
[1:59:46] the way he showed look cry back here in
[1:59:51] the time of Noah he showed he told Noah
[1:59:54] he said Noah when he revealed to him an
[1:59:57] ark make an ark for the saving of you
[2:00:01] and your household Noah was instructed
[2:00:06] there was a pattern that was given how
[2:00:08] that the ark itself would have three
[2:00:10] floors to it there's three works of
[2:00:14] grace but within that there was one tree
[2:00:18] that was cut down one type of a tree cut
[2:00:22] down and the life was taken out of that
[2:00:24] tree the ark itself would be formed out
[2:00:28] of this other tree but this other tree
[2:00:32] would have to come to a place to where
[2:00:35] it could absorb the life from this other
[2:00:38] tree so this tree had to die to give its
[2:00:43] life
[2:00:44] these trees had to die surrendering
[2:00:48] their life that this life might seal
[2:00:51] these trees because as he said thou
[2:00:55] shalt pitch it in that word pitch the
[2:00:58] first time
[2:00:59] the word atonement is used in the
[2:01:02] scriptures if our that shall make a
[2:01:06] pitch the atonement his wife coming to
[2:01:10] you and I is the atonement the at1 meant
[2:01:14] no longer Twain but one I told that look
[2:01:21] how Jesus says this can I have just a
[2:01:24] few more moments
[2:01:25] I mean I'm winding this down I'm not
[2:01:28] gonna be with you next week ends I want
[2:01:29] to I want to get this in here in Matthew
[2:01:33] 16:24 Jesus says if any man will come
[2:01:40] after me come after me he's not talking
[2:01:48] about just following just like in
[2:01:49] earthly footsteps but this word come
[2:01:52] means to move from one place to another
[2:01:58] in order to come after him they have to
[2:02:03] be a part of him and be invited and then
[2:02:07] he brings us into fellowship that we
[2:02:10] might come after him let him deny
[2:02:16] himself and take up his cross and follow
[2:02:21] me
[2:02:21] how many of you know that Jesus spoke
[2:02:24] more of our cross than he did his he
[2:02:27] spoke a lot more of our cross than he
[2:02:28] did his cross deny who himself so that's
[2:02:34] where it starts he didn't say take up
[2:02:35] his cross and then deny himself no same
[2:02:37] order he became obedient unto death even
[2:02:40] the death of the cross so denying self
[2:02:45] this had to be a death and take up his
[2:02:48] cross and follow me for whosoever will
[2:02:50] save his life shall lose it so he said
[2:02:54] if you want to keep your life you can
[2:02:56] keep it but you'll lose it but whosoever
[2:02:59] will lose his life for my sake shall
[2:03:02] find it he's the example he lost his
[2:03:09] life
[2:03:10] but he gained it and nothing he just
[2:03:13] gained life look what he gained for what
[2:03:20] his profit was a man profited if he
[2:03:22] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[2:03:24] soul or what shall a man give in
[2:03:26] exchange for his soul they say this is
[2:03:32] where it comes down to that place Satan
[2:03:34] and all cost
[2:03:37] desires to prevent death I said what
[2:03:41] what you mean he
[2:03:43] I thought Satan was taken was you know
[2:03:45] out here and trying to take people's
[2:03:47] lives and you know I'm talking about
[2:03:49] spiritual from where that we die to
[2:03:53] ourselves because Satan knows when death
[2:03:57] comes his power ends and death his rule
[2:04:03] his Dominion ends there that is why
[2:04:06] Satan will offer substitutes that's why
[2:04:12] he'll offer substitutes to people such
[2:04:14] as all you gotta do is believe that's it
[2:04:17] it is belief believe on the Lord Jesus
[2:04:19] Christ and then quote the Scriptures but
[2:04:22] remember if you're still squirming as a
[2:04:25] serpent you haven't died yet this has
[2:04:30] made possible that we might die just
[2:04:37] become a part of our church become a
[2:04:39] part of our assembly listen friends we
[2:04:41] bring it right down here we can't keep
[2:04:43] this out here oh all you got to do is is
[2:04:45] believe the message all you gotta do is
[2:04:47] believe God sent a prophet it's deeper
[2:04:50] than that don't you let people misplace
[2:04:56] words on you when people go to saying
[2:04:58] and they say well the message is the
[2:05:00] token how are you saying that how are
[2:05:04] you saying that because the Prophet
[2:05:07] never bypassed nor did he do away with
[2:05:10] the baptism of the holy ghost but the
[2:05:13] true message is the message of Jesus
[2:05:16] Christ and His righteousness so if
[2:05:19] you're going to say that the message and
[2:05:20] you're saying that is a token if your
[2:05:22] tie
[2:05:23] that together and letting it be that
[2:05:25] it's Christ the Holy Ghost in you I can
[2:05:27] see men but just to know this message is
[2:05:31] not life just to be around it is not
[2:05:35] life come on now this is where the water
[2:05:39] is flowing
[2:05:39] unless you're positioned in it right as
[2:05:43] a tree of righteousness if you're just
[2:05:45] laying in it you'll rot you've got to be
[2:05:49] positioned in it to draw that life into
[2:05:53] yourself it's more than just an
[2:05:58] association it's more than if this is
[2:06:01] it's got to be a life that's on display
[2:06:03] life that goes it's beyond this church
[2:06:07] is beyond when we're here in kinds of
[2:06:09] service it's a life that goes with you
[2:06:11] everyday it shows itself in the
[2:06:15] workplace on the job everywhere you go
[2:06:19] but Satan wants to prevent death or if
[2:06:28] he can stop it you're trying to get
[2:06:31] things upon people's minds all get to
[2:06:32] looking forward to this and get to
[2:06:34] looking forward to that remember there's
[2:06:36] one thing there's one thing don't miss
[2:06:38] it
[2:06:38] don't miss it don't miss the rapture
[2:06:42] don't miss the climax of his coming
[2:06:46] don't miss being a part of the body of
[2:06:49] Jesus Christ listen I'm not just talking
[2:06:51] about well I'm not you you and brother
[2:06:52] sent me here you're talking like I need
[2:06:54] to get ready to die you're not fit to
[2:06:58] live till you're ready to die you're not
[2:07:02] you're not getting ready to die you're
[2:07:03] getting ready to live you love you
[2:07:15] now closing there's two altars here's
[2:07:22] the gate the East of Eden process of
[2:07:28] time here comes Kane
[2:07:33] here comes Abel they're coming to
[2:07:36] worship Kane comes up he offers fruit
[2:07:44] beautiful fruit beautiful he came to
[2:07:49] worship he had a church Kane was humble
[2:07:57] here comes Abel and here is Abel coming
[2:08:02] to worship but Abel doesn't have fruit
[2:08:08] he has a lamb
[2:08:16] so one has a sound one does it have a
[2:08:20] sound here's two alters and Cain comes
[2:08:26] and lays himself upon the altar and once
[2:08:30] you listen this now Cain comes and lays
[2:08:34] himself upon the altar and begins to
[2:08:37] worship God and as he's laying upon his
[2:08:42] altar God rejects it he's brought fruit
[2:08:51] that he toiled and he brought the best
[2:08:54] fruit and he is laying on the altar and
[2:08:58] God refuses it why his sacrifice had no
[2:09:10] sound there was no sound of death in his
[2:09:17] sacrifice but here comes Abel here comes
[2:09:23] the lamb Abel prepares the lamb here it
[2:09:29] is laid upon the altar evil takes that
[2:09:37] jagged rock or the brown would describe
[2:09:39] it
[2:09:39] he cuts that throat and he lays that
[2:09:44] lamb upon the altar and God hears he
[2:09:52] hears the sound of death hears the sound
[2:09:56] of death God said what I revealed what I
[2:10:01] revealed now it's substance and Abel is
[2:10:05] offering this enable himself he climbs
[2:10:08] upon the altar with his land
[2:10:12] and God receives Abel with his sacrifice
[2:10:19] because Abel's sacrifice God heard the
[2:10:26] death rattle this one God didn't hear
[2:10:31] any death this one it looked wonderful
[2:10:33] it looked just right he was pressed
[2:10:36] prostrate everything was just right you
[2:10:40] know brother bran dramatizes no doubt it
[2:10:41] Cain he cried and he worshiped and he he
[2:10:45] was able Abel's crying Abel's worshiping
[2:10:48] but then remember Abel himself because
[2:10:55] of his sacrifice label Abel dies on the
[2:11:02] same altar he's received with his
[2:11:08] sacrifice so what is it it's death he
[2:11:15] has made a way that you can die to
[2:11:19] yourself because in order to be born
[2:11:22] again you first have to die and that's
[2:11:28] the same listen that's the same way in
[2:11:31] every part of our life it's dying to
[2:11:35] self this age this age the epitome of
[2:11:41] this age the Bible describes in first
[2:11:43] Timothy four men shall be lovers of them
[2:11:48] own selves do away with drywall just put
[2:11:53] mirrors all over their house lovers of
[2:11:58] themselves
[2:12:03] but I ask you are you willing to lose
[2:12:07] sight of yourself
[2:12:09] allow and be died to yourself that he
[2:12:13] might be born in you are you willing to
[2:12:18] relinquish you said by the same knife
[2:12:20] I've already come to this place oh oh I
[2:12:23] remember a lamb well if it's a lamb
[2:12:25] nature that's been raised up it's still
[2:12:29] self-sacrificing it doesn't draw to a
[2:12:32] place that oh no no it's
[2:12:35] self-sacrificing it's going all the way
[2:12:39] this is part of reconciliation but you
[2:12:44] see it's a part that Satan doesn't want
[2:12:47] nobody to know about you don't want you
[2:12:51] don't want people to know about death
[2:12:52] because without death he still has power
[2:12:58] no matter how knowledgeable of the word
[2:13:00] it can be he still has power but when
[2:13:04] death has come he sets down there in
[2:13:07] your life then you have greater is He
[2:13:11] that is in you then he that's in the
[2:13:15] world
[2:13:15] you now have authority and you take
[2:13:20] possession of this vessel it's not your
[2:13:24] inheritance but it's your possession and
[2:13:27] when this vessel wants to pull back the
[2:13:30] inside man copes with the word the
[2:13:33] inside man says Lord be it unto me be it
[2:13:38] unto me be it unto me dying to ourselves
[2:13:43] aren't you glad he made a way aren't you
[2:13:46] listen friends he makes a way and he has
[2:13:50] made a way and he continues to manifest
[2:13:52] that way to you and I that we might
[2:13:55] continue to die to ourselves I don't
[2:14:01] know about you sometimes I just get lost
[2:14:02] in prayer just rejoicing God thank you
[2:14:06] that a heart can be clean heart can be
[2:14:10] free you understand or something that
[2:14:14] maybe has been done wrong or more thank
[2:14:16] God thank you
[2:14:17] you might say brother say man that
[2:14:18] sounds juvenile I don't think so
[2:14:20] I don't think so I think God for that
[2:14:23] because I know there's not a gene inside
[2:14:26] the Browning's
[2:14:27] that could overcome that but it has to
[2:14:32] be a prevailing of the gene of God on
[2:14:34] the inside and let me say you can't help
[2:14:39] it
[2:14:40] it shall prevail so you look around you
[2:14:46] say I still see all my mistakes
[2:14:48] I still see weaknesses but you know the
[2:14:50] desire of your heart and your life has
[2:14:53] been changed and when that has been
[2:14:55] changed those are grounds that you stand
[2:14:57] on that that devil cannot put his feet
[2:15:00] on and you stand on those grounds
[2:15:03] remember what when Moses stood on those
[2:15:05] grounds remember how the Prophet takes
[2:15:06] us back to those sacred sands you stand
[2:15:09] upon those grounds you've got a place to
[2:15:12] stand where Satan can never put his
[2:15:14] dirty feet it's a place he can never and
[2:15:17] from that place you you the real you you
[2:15:21] have to be reconciled there will you
[2:15:23] has been given authority to stand up to
[2:15:31] stand up and to live not unto yourself
[2:15:35] but unto Him
[2:15:39] what what what love is this
[2:15:42] he made away for you and I well we were
[2:15:47] yet sinners yet he said there's some
[2:15:49] lambs here there's lambs this road in
[2:15:53] the Lamb's Book of Life and the Lamb of
[2:15:57] God came to redeem the Lambs of God I
[2:16:02] give myself away lord I give myself away
[2:16:06] willingly not made to you see it's not
[2:16:10] made to by mom and dad or no I give
[2:16:13] myself to you you let him draw you you
[2:16:16] let him draw you let him work let him
[2:16:18] move within your life listen friends
[2:16:19] don't live your life under pressure but
[2:16:21] what you see from others you yield to
[2:16:25] the Lord as the Lord is dealing with you
[2:16:29] you don't want to impersonate anything
[2:16:31] this is between you and him you yield to
[2:16:35] him and you let him draw you and do the
[2:16:39] full work in your life let him just
[2:16:41] submit to him you don't have to make it
[2:16:44] happen even of things that he's dealing
[2:16:45] with in your life and it's dealt with
[2:16:47] your life in this service and your
[2:16:49] weaknesses stand up before you your
[2:16:51] shortcomings but remember let him draw
[2:16:53] you and say Lord within me is that same
[2:16:57] life I believe that Lord and that same
[2:17:01] life there was not anything that could
[2:17:05] keep that life buried it could not keep
[2:17:09] it in the grave it lost its hold how did
[2:17:14] that happen by submission just submit
[2:17:18] and Lee lay before him oh my I love you
[2:17:25] I love you in the Lord what a privilege
[2:17:31] it is to be a partaker of his life
[2:17:34] that's what this is kind that's what
[2:17:36] this is here this is why we come to the
[2:17:38] services that we and ourselves might
[2:17:41] draw strength from him
[2:17:44] so I do that III do that every day you
[2:17:47] should you should but here God comes
[2:17:49] down and he speaks to you and I and
[2:17:51] he'll call that flesh you'll call it in
[2:17:55] line and that inner man says that's the
[2:17:57] truth and flesh will say Oh get up quick
[2:18:01] go to the bathroom right now quick but
[2:18:03] the inner man says sit down I brought
[2:18:06] you here I brought you here
[2:18:10] sit down you remember the older brother
[2:18:17] says what's all this commotion the
[2:18:19] younger brother says I've been redeemed

[2:20:19] to ourselves
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:23] then Lord we might be born again
[2:20:28] it can be born again that the first
[2:20:30] nature is still alive or the desires of
[2:20:36] the world well God even Lord as it's a
[2:20:41] cleansing Lord within that but father
[2:20:45] your desire is that your life that fire
[2:20:49] to where every every desire of the world
[2:20:56] is so burn out of our lives and where
[2:20:59] you take residence smart in our lives
[2:21:03] to where the very declaration Lord of
[2:21:07] our life is Christ who is our life nor
[2:21:14] Jesus some things Lord this morning or
[2:21:18] no doubt said pretty straight but father
[2:21:21] you know my heart in this age this is an
[2:21:25] age of such callousness an age Lord
[2:21:28] where the enemy Lord such deception
[2:21:35] father my heart's desire Lord I don't
[2:21:37] want no one to miss this life I don't
[2:21:43] want anyone
[2:21:46] what goddess Noah could stand there on
[2:21:48] the ark and preach he preached as though
[2:21:51] it was to everybody and I believed all
[2:21:55] that that's exactly how that you declare
[2:22:00] your word it's broadcast to all
[2:22:07] the Lord God there's there's elected
[2:22:11] seed there's children and when that word
[2:22:14] is broadcast that live it makes its way
[2:22:19] the Lord begins to move down beneath it
[2:22:26] begins to deal with that seed that life
[2:22:30] that's hidden down there on the inside
[2:22:32] oh god I pray Lord this is the desire
[2:22:40] Lord it's your desire what you you place
[2:22:43] that desire Lord in our hearts Lord and
[2:22:46] that would be your God that your life
[2:22:49] would be preeminence in our lives Lord
[2:22:51] that's my desire Lord father for every
[2:22:56] every brother and sister for each one
[2:23:00] Lord would come here Lord and and they
[2:23:03] would make this Lord God their home
[2:23:06] church they would look to me Lord as
[2:23:10] their pastor or God how would fail them

[2:23:16] the right way to you Lord Lord Jesus

[2:23:26] by membership it's not in by association
[2:23:31] Oh God
[2:23:36] there is that spiritual body the body of
[2:23:40] Jesus Christ it's by one spirit were
[2:23:44] baptized into that body what God it's
[2:23:48] your life that it calls out it's just
[2:23:51] like when that atonement was made in the
[2:23:55] time of Jubilee there was a priest that
[2:24:00] would go out and ride throughout the
[2:24:03] land and he would blow he would blow and
[2:24:11] announce that the sacrifice has been
[2:24:17] accepted he would announce this is the
[2:24:20] year of Jubilee that announcement that
[2:24:24] went forth it was a sounding of the
[2:24:27] blood sounding of the life and each one
[2:24:33] Lord that held within him an instrument
[2:24:37] a tool habits they could throw that down
[2:24:43] and say I can go back to my inheritance
[2:24:49] I don't have to stay a slave and serve
[2:24:53] sin any longer
[2:24:55] Oh God granite may that sound rise
[2:25:03] within the hearts Lord may it rise in
[2:25:08] certainty Lord God Lord Jesus I pray
[2:25:16] Lord God for many many of us Lord we've
[2:25:22] come to that place a fellowship in you
[2:25:26] Lord to be born again we're the token
[2:25:31] life itself
[2:25:33] has laid claim on our lives and we are
[2:25:37] identified with our sacrifice and yet
[2:25:42] Lord we want to die more to ourselves
[2:25:49] Lord this that I pack around with me
[2:25:55] under the name of Samuel browning he
[2:25:59] gets in my way things the Lord it can be
[2:26:04] a feelings thoughts so many different

[2:26:09] equiping on the inside that equipping
[2:26:15] isn't for me to manhandle the sky but
[2:26:21] it's to submit to the inner man for as
[2:26:28] you said to us through your word for if
[2:26:32] you do mortify the deeds of the body
[2:26:36] through the spirit you shall live
