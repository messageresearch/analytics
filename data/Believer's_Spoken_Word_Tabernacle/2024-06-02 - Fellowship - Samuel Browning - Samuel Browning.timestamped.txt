[38:33] and um all that heat out of that water

[39:23] and prayer and uh
[39:26] so I was a exciting news this morning
[39:29] early and uh so I said we would just uh
[39:33] be praying for them as well and the Lord
[39:35] just give him just a real a real good
[39:38] delivery there and
[39:40] um so I know brother Sean's kind of
[39:44] anxious I I went by there on the way in
[39:47] I said you're excited aren't
[39:49] you you know I don't know if you know it
[39:51] or not brother Sean's probably already
[39:53] got him a car built and everything else
[39:56] you know but uh
[39:57] that's exciting and so we are very
[40:00] excited for them and um just good to be
[40:03] here this morning in his presence and we
[40:06] just want to invite the Lord just to
[40:09] take control here in the remaining part
[40:11] of the service he's here and we
[40:13] certainly need him amen God knows your
[40:16] need Ben turn these down a little bit
[40:18] more this just too loud please
[40:21] um God knows our needs so personally and
[40:25] um how many you believe that that you
[40:28] know many times it's like when I have we
[40:31] were preaching and um I don't know I've
[40:34] got too much something there too much
[40:35] here there's too much
[40:38] somewhere um we were preaching on that
[40:41] here just the other day of um of Hope
[40:45] and that has been a very uh been a very
[40:48] dear subject to me here over the past uh
[40:50] few months and
[40:52] um I I think of that of um when we we
[40:57] look at it of what an expectation that
[40:59] God gives to us I look how many times we
[41:02] walk into a service and not all the time
[41:05] but sometimes we come into a place and
[41:07] we're looking and saying Lord I just
[41:09] need a word from you I really don't even
[41:12] know what to even to say or to tell you
[41:15] or to ask or the correct petition but
[41:18] you know what I have need of you know
[41:21] you remember that little boy that
[41:22] brother brandom always tells that story
[41:24] and you've heard me referred to it many
[41:26] times about as he just put up ab c d cuz
[41:30] he didn't know what to say brother Bram
[41:32] goes into that story and he says what it
[41:33] was he said that little boy was being
[41:36] raised in a step home he was being
[41:39] abused situations that were taking place
[41:42] that he had no idea how to even pray
[41:45] about and so he said I'm just going to
[41:48] give him the ABCs cuz he knows what's on
[41:51] my
[41:52] heart and I believe God when we come
[41:55] into times like this God knows what we
[41:57] have need of and there's a hope Paul
[42:00] writes of in Romans 8 I've got an
[42:02] expectation that God you know I need a
[42:06] word from you and we certainly need a
[42:09] word from him amen so let's just go to
[42:12] him and a word of
[42:15] prayer Heavenly
[42:17] Father Lord we thank you for
[42:20] these moments that you give to us Lord

[46:36] 2 thank
[46:50] you no no I'm good thank
[46:54] you let's just go right into to uh verse
[46:58] 11 of Ruth chapter
[47:01] 2 and I want to just get right down into
[47:04] verse
[47:05] 14 but let's start here and
[47:09] um and the scripture says and Boaz
[47:12] answered and said unto her it hath been
[47:17] fully it have fully been showed to me
[47:20] all that thou has done unto thy
[47:22] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[47:24] husband and how thou Hast left thy
[47:27] father and thy mother and the land of
[47:30] thy Nativity and art come unto a people
[47:33] which thou knowest not
[47:35] hitherto the Lord recompense thy Work
[47:38] and a full reward be given thee of the
[47:42] Lord God of Israel under whose wings
[47:45] Thou Art come to
[47:47] trust then she said let me find favor in
[47:52] thy sight my lord for thou Hast
[47:55] comforted me me for thou H has spoken
[47:59] friendly unto thine handmade though I be
[48:02] not like unto one of thine
[48:06] handmaids look at this grace that comes
[48:09] to her and Boaz says unto her at Meal
[48:13] Time Come Thou hither pise God and eat
[48:16] of the bread and dip thy morsel in the
[48:21] vinegar this a vinegar would be a a real
[48:25] moment of refreshing when lab in and
[48:27] toiling and throughout the field it's
[48:29] one of those Customs even in the East
[48:32] sometimes they would mix a little bit of
[48:34] wine with the vinegar sometimes they'll
[48:36] take the water and the vinegar but it's
[48:37] it's meant among the Reapers that when
[48:40] they would come it would bring a
[48:43] refreshing so he's inviting her to a
[48:45] refreshing dip that morsel in the
[48:48] vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers
[48:52] and he reached her parched corn and she
[48:56] did eat and was sufficed and
[49:00] left amen may the Lord bless you and
[49:04] bless the reading of the words you're
[49:05] being
[49:06] seated I want to come back to a a quote
[49:11] out of the message Redeemer and
[49:13] Redemption where we had started looking
[49:16] at this part
[49:17] and uh I think this morning I'll
[49:20] probably be able we'll see to finish at
[49:25] least this verse of it but
[49:27] I want to read this quote here where
[49:29] brother Bram draws this and you know
[49:31] there's so many little nuggets and
[49:33] things that are pointed out on the holy
[49:35] spirit will just take a hold of them for
[49:37] us and just really amplify them brother
[49:40] brah says when it comes the midday and
[49:44] you get tired come over and sit down
[49:46] under the tree and take the morsel of
[49:49] bread and dip right in with the rest of
[49:52] them brother Bram says I like that
[49:55] that's fellow ship get right around
[49:58] under the shade tree oh he says don't
[50:01] you love to get under there and just dip
[50:04] right in with the rest of them now I
[50:07] want to speak here this morning on
[50:10] Fellowship you find that this is a
[50:13] message that in that particular word
[50:15] you'll find it titled many many
[50:18] different places through the message
[50:20] Fellowship by Redemption Fellowship
[50:22] fellowship with God on and on the
[50:24] prophet will preach it many times and
[50:26] you realize that in reality that God
[50:30] it's God's desire to have fellowship
[50:32] with you and I God's desire is by no
[50:36] means for us just to be members of a
[50:38] church or that we would somehow be
[50:40] affiliated with something or just
[50:42] Associated but God's desire is
[50:45] fellowship that we would have fellowship
[50:47] with him and then in turn by having
[50:50] Fellowship in him then we can actually
[50:52] have the right kind of fellowship with
[50:54] one another and so this this is
[50:57] something to where that Ruth herself is
[50:59] invited into this Fellowship now when we
[51:04] think of it what a what a Grace that's
[51:05] been given where she can come and sit
[51:08] down under the trees I think it's
[51:10] fitting how the prophet would place it
[51:12] because in many of these accounts like
[51:14] this with the Reapers it would be almost
[51:16] as though they would be in some sort of
[51:18] a shelter or they would ride of it of a
[51:20] booth something to where that they would
[51:22] be able to come in out of the Heat and
[51:25] the toil of the day and you're aware
[51:27] that when you look through the
[51:28] scriptures many times with leaves itself
[51:31] it will speak of Fellowship leaves that
[51:34] even would be upon the tree would speak
[51:36] of Fellowship this is one of the things
[51:39] that the enemy eventually ate away among
[51:41] the Church of the Living God he started
[51:44] with to remove brotherly love and then
[51:46] went on to remove Divine Fellowship but
[51:49] it's always been God's desire to have
[51:52] fellowship with his children if you
[51:54] think clear back to how that when we
[51:56] recognized in the in the very beginning
[51:59] or before the beginning the scripture
[52:01] tells us that the sons of God shouted
[52:03] for joy and we recognize that that was
[52:06] all about whereas sons of God even in
[52:09] that time would catch a glimpse of our
[52:12] Salvation through the blood of the Lamb
[52:15] that there would be a bringing back and
[52:17] a Redemption God himself desired to have
[52:21] fellowship with his children but there
[52:23] had to come forth a a bedding ground
[52:26] that which which God could actually
[52:28] actually make himself known to his
[52:30] children and have that kind of
[52:32] Fellowship it it's kind of like when if
[52:34] you think about it in this terms like I
[52:36] think of our three boys right here
[52:38] though there could move upon my heart to
[52:41] desire to be a father and yet though
[52:43] they were there the whole time but yet
[52:46] there had to come a beding ground and
[52:48] there had to come a time that in order
[52:51] that we could have fellowship or they
[52:53] would become manifested and then we
[52:57] could have fellowship and that's exactly
[53:00] the way that God does when he brings
[53:03] forth his children God by his Spirit by
[53:06] his word he brings forth his children
[53:09] that you and I might have a real
[53:12] fellowship with him now you know you
[53:14] can't have Fellowship unless you've got
[53:16] things that are in common you've got to
[53:19] have things in common you know birds of
[53:21] a feather flock together this is why
[53:24] that Paul would write you know some of
[53:26] the very first writings of the word
[53:28] Fellowship falls in the New Testament
[53:30] you'll find it once in the Old Testament
[53:32] but this word fellowship and as we speak
[53:35] of it is something that appears and
[53:37] comes first in the New Testament not
[53:40] many not many times is it written of
[53:42] even in the New Testament but it would
[53:44] always refer to not only that of the
[53:47] body but how that the believer would be
[53:49] in fellowship with almighty God and we
[53:52] know that there are things that you know
[53:54] sometimes we can talk to one another and
[53:56] there's people that we have that are
[53:58] wonderful friends and Associates but you
[54:01] just don't have a lot in common with
[54:02] them you know they're good people
[54:04] sometimes you know individuals you know
[54:06] that we can talk with listen even
[54:08] setting in the body of Christ we can
[54:11] have certain things that when we would
[54:12] get outside of talking of the word maybe
[54:15] we don't have a lot in common and then
[54:17] there's sometimes that we find among
[54:19] others that my there's certain things
[54:21] that we do have in common that that's
[54:23] all the differences that would be among
[54:25] us or differences that we would like in
[54:27] our preferences and so forth and the
[54:29] Holy Spirit doesn't take that away but
[54:32] there's one thing that the spirit of God
[54:34] does do is he works to bring uh each and
[54:37] every one of us into a fellowship with
[54:40] him and then through that fellowship
[54:42] with him then we can have real
[54:45] fellowship with one another and so when
[54:48] the prophet is speaking of this here
[54:50] with Ruth of how that she has been
[54:53] invited to this place and what a
[54:55] wonderful thing it is to be able to come
[54:57] into fellowship and set under the table
[55:00] I think that's wonderful don't you I
[55:01] think it's wonderful that God gives us
[55:03] an opportunity to be able to come and to
[55:06] Fellowship together with one another
[55:09] what a privilege that is that God has
[55:11] given us I thank God that he's given us
[55:13] a place that we can come to a building
[55:16] and that we can come and gather and more
[55:18] than just a building but to have that
[55:20] Revelation that would move in our hearts
[55:23] to come to a place to say Lord I'm
[55:25] coming to hear from you I'm coming
[55:28] together with my brothers and sisters of
[55:31] like Precious faith and Lord I'm looking
[55:33] to hear from you now watch how this is
[55:36] written in Fellowship here in 1 John
[55:39] chapter 1 I believe this with all my
[55:41] heart notice this which was from the
[55:43] beginning which we have heard and which
[55:46] we have seen with our eyes which we have
[55:49] looked upon and our hands have handled
[55:52] of the word of life for the life was
[55:55] manifested and we have seen it and bear
[55:58] witness and show unto you that eternal
[56:01] life which was with the father and was
[56:04] manifested unto us that which we have
[56:08] seen and heard declare we unto you that
[56:12] ye Also may have fellowship with us and
[56:15] truly our fellowship is with the father
[56:19] and with his son Jesus Christ and these
[56:21] things write we unto you that your joy
[56:24] may be full now no noce this desire of
[56:28] what John himself would write of what
[56:30] God has made known this life what we saw
[56:34] tabernacled this same deity in the body
[56:37] of Jesus Christ not only have we handled
[56:41] it but we ourselves have become
[56:44] Witnesses by the resurrection by the
[56:47] quickening power of the same life that
[56:49] dwelt there that now has made a reality
[56:53] in our hearts that we're not just called
[56:57] as though to say well you're a Son of
[56:59] God but the spirit of God comes to make
[57:02] that a living reality within our hearts
[57:05] that indeed you and I are the children
[57:08] of God so in other words it's not
[57:10] something that you have to go and ask
[57:12] somebody else about but it's something
[57:15] that God wants to do personally for you
[57:18] and God wants to make that so real and
[57:20] of course it will come and God will
[57:22] build on that you you know more as you
[57:24] feed on the word you find yourself the
[57:27] strength and the maturity the stability
[57:30] it just becomes more real but God
[57:33] himself is the one who first gives that
[57:35] divine revelation that's what the real
[57:37] New Birth is it's a revelation of Jesus
[57:41] Christ to you personally it's where
[57:43] there becomes a settling and where that
[57:46] sin the desire of sin is gone from your
[57:48] life there's no there's no desire
[57:51] whatever that it could be there in your
[57:53] life or what was is no longer there what
[57:56] has done that the Lord Jesus Christ the
[57:59] same one that rose on that Easter
[58:01] morning now because the blood cell was
[58:03] open that life has come and brought you
[58:06] into Fellowship now notice the spirit
[58:09] here that is working we find this all
[58:11] the way in the Book of Revelations we
[58:14] find it all the way through the New
[58:16] Testament we even find in in God's heart
[58:19] when you read in the Old Testament where
[58:21] God will speak of sacrifices he'll speak
[58:24] of ignorance in the camp and those
[58:26] things and God will make known that
[58:28] these sacrifices they are also things
[58:32] that will be accepted by strangers God
[58:35] knowing even then that there would be
[58:38] those as those who came in to the
[58:40] economy of God in Israel your rahab's
[58:43] your Ruth like we're writing on that
[58:45] they were not in themselves Jews but
[58:48] they were strangers this is what Ruth
[58:50] has said before but God in His Grace has
[58:54] already made provision because God
[58:56] already knew even that the Jews would
[58:59] reject they would not accept the Messiah
[59:01] but remember that was in the plan and
[59:04] mind of God because you and I were in
[59:08] God's mind all along it was God's desire
[59:11] to have a bride all along a bride that
[59:14] he would choose one that would would be
[59:16] a part of him one that he could express
[59:19] himself through and to see this desire
[59:22] to me when I look at this in the
[59:24] scripture how John says that we also may
[59:27] have fellowship with us now this was not
[59:30] something of just let's just you know
[59:32] let's all get together underneath this
[59:34] banner and you know we have something
[59:36] that we associate on you know there's
[59:38] many things you can associate around but
[59:40] you see the real Fellowship of the
[59:43] believer is not about an association of
[59:46] ideas the real Fellowship of a Believer
[59:49] is a fellowship under the shed blood of
[59:52] the Lamb you you say what are you saying
[59:54] that sometimes that that there can be
[59:57] things within Fellowship that there can
[59:59] be groupings and groups will come
[1:00:01] together under a certain identity a
[1:00:04] certain strain a certain belief but you
[1:00:06] know that's not what God intended God
[1:00:09] intended that the fellowship would be
[1:00:11] under the shed blood that though there
[1:00:13] might be differences though there are
[1:00:15] certain things like brother Ram talks
[1:00:16] about Jack Moore he said there's not a
[1:00:18] better friend that I have he said then
[1:00:20] Jack Moore he said but if we sat down he
[1:00:23] said there's things that were a million
[1:00:25] miles apart on but we still have love
[1:00:28] and fellowship for one another now I
[1:00:32] think that's exactly what the Holy
[1:00:33] Spirit produces in our life so notice
[1:00:36] this Fellowship it's not about just
[1:00:38] fellowshipping with us but John is
[1:00:40] letting it be known this is where our
[1:00:43] fellowship is drawn from we truly verse
[1:00:46] three our fellowship is with the father
[1:00:49] and with his son Jesus Christ we are
[1:00:51] walking in step with that word so this
[1:00:54] this Spirit it produces is a True
[1:00:56] Fellowship on an individual level which
[1:00:59] when that moves down and that contact of
[1:01:02] a reality that would strike in our
[1:01:04] hearts what does it produce in our life
[1:01:06] it produces a longing for a lost brother
[1:01:10] a lost sister it even puts a burden in
[1:01:13] our hearts for someone who has gone
[1:01:15] astray there is a desire why because
[1:01:18] through and by the real Spirit of
[1:01:20] redemption the Holy Spirit it brings us
[1:01:23] into co-partners in Redemption with the
[1:01:26] Lord Jesus Christ and so we have that
[1:01:29] same desire notice how Paul or John
[1:01:31] would write this in continuing this then
[1:01:34] is the message which we have heard of
[1:01:36] him and declare unto you that God is
[1:01:38] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:01:43] if we say we have fellowship with him
[1:01:46] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[1:01:49] the truth so you see a person that could
[1:01:52] say I've got fellowship with God now
[1:01:54] remember we're not is talking this
[1:01:56] scripture is not talking about just
[1:01:58] someone who gets down and they pray
[1:02:01] prayer is a prayer is a time of
[1:02:03] Fellowship but remember Fellowship
[1:02:05] itself is not a one-way Street the
[1:02:09] prophet would say it over and over in
[1:02:10] the communion messages he said real
[1:02:13] communion is fellowship it's not where
[1:02:15] we're doing all the talking but it's
[1:02:17] where we are doing a majority of
[1:02:20] listening and so when we recognize this
[1:02:23] Fellowship it's things that we have in
[1:02:25] common
[1:02:26] so if a person would say now sometimes
[1:02:29] you know individuals you know a person
[1:02:31] that doesn't understand the truth maybe
[1:02:33] they're a taught that when you walk into
[1:02:35] a church you shake a hands or you recite
[1:02:37] a Creed well you know you're in
[1:02:39] Fellowship but you know that's not the
[1:02:41] fellowship that John's talking about
[1:02:43] right here this Fellowship itself is
[1:02:46] where there has come a Divine Union and
[1:02:48] the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed
[1:02:51] has removed every bit of sin and the
[1:02:54] Very desire of sin nature itself that's
[1:02:58] the power of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:01] so if a person would say I have
[1:03:03] fellowship with God they're actually
[1:03:05] saying that I hear from God God is my
[1:03:09] father and that life is working in me if
[1:03:12] the life within will not punctuate every
[1:03:15] word with an amen or express it with an
[1:03:19] amen then it is not in full Fellowship
[1:03:22] yet it might be in Fellowship among a
[1:03:24] body of believers but it's not come into
[1:03:27] the full Fellowship that God intended
[1:03:30] whereby that his life is living out
[1:03:33] through our
[1:03:35] lives watch this but if we walk in the
[1:03:38] light as he is in the light we have
[1:03:41] Fellowship one with another now notice
[1:03:44] how this how this comes about if we walk
[1:03:47] in the light as he's in the light we
[1:03:50] have Fellowship one with another so how
[1:03:53] does real Fellowship come even
[1:03:55] Fellowship among every one of us you
[1:03:57] realize that when a person first comes
[1:04:00] into a assembly a church and I I thank
[1:04:03] God that there are lives and hearts and
[1:04:05] testimonies that even I've received the
[1:04:07] meetings and then even prior to the
[1:04:09] meetings of things of how the atmosphere
[1:04:12] that God would bring and have Among Us I
[1:04:14] think if God in his Mercy that would be
[1:04:16] an atmosphere where lives would come up
[1:04:19] that even I'm talking about him before
[1:04:21] the meetings would come up a minister
[1:04:23] would say what a wonderful atmosphere
[1:04:25] that is in the church right there an
[1:04:27] atmosphere where it's at Liberty to
[1:04:29] worship and a and an atmosphere of Love
[1:04:31] listen let me tell you something if that
[1:04:33] can be when when we and ourselves may
[1:04:36] not even be aware of it what what is it
[1:04:39] and what will it be when we can say God
[1:04:42] let everything let every bit of
[1:04:44] indifference or if there's anything in
[1:04:46] my life when the spirit of God can bring
[1:04:48] us into such a place to be so mindful
[1:04:51] even more than what we would be I'm
[1:04:53] telling you friends it's hard to to tell
[1:04:56] what will be done do you realize the
[1:04:58] prophet said that when the Church of the
[1:05:00] Living God would be taken into such a
[1:05:02] place in Divine love he said they won't
[1:05:04] even have to lay hands but the sick will
[1:05:07] be healed I believe in laying on hands
[1:05:09] but he's talking about to such a place
[1:05:11] when the love of God comes so deep in
[1:05:13] our life that we lose sense of our own
[1:05:17] selves we lose sight of self and our
[1:05:20] focus is on him and one another that's
[1:05:23] real Fellowship right there so notice
[1:05:25] this is how we would have fellowship
[1:05:28] with one another and the blood of Jesus
[1:05:30] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:05:34] notice in the message what is the Holy
[1:05:37] Ghost now brother brandham when he's
[1:05:38] when he goes in to speak this brother
[1:05:41] brandham is coming off of some meetings
[1:05:43] and you know he's preached on it over
[1:05:45] and over and there's many times within
[1:05:47] at a church and assembly there many
[1:05:49] things that we have to revisit and go
[1:05:51] back over and you notice brother BR is
[1:05:53] returning back to the Tabernacle and
[1:05:56] he's burdened even as he's coming back
[1:05:58] to it he's even announcing it when he's
[1:06:00] out in other places he said I'm heading
[1:06:02] back to the Tabernacle for a real time
[1:06:04] of Consecration and as he says that we
[1:06:07] come back to this time of consecration
[1:06:09] he said because I'm seeing things are
[1:06:11] you hearing me he says I'm seeing things
[1:06:13] in the Tabernacle he said where I see
[1:06:16] real good people he said I mean they're
[1:06:18] fine people real good he said but you
[1:06:21] know he says there's just something
[1:06:23] lacking there're good people fine people
[1:06:25] people but he says what's lacking is is
[1:06:28] there needs to be a deeper experience
[1:06:31] and so the prophet would come under the
[1:06:33] burden and he would preach these series
[1:06:36] The Holy Ghost series what is the Holy
[1:06:38] Ghost what's it given for how do I know
[1:06:40] when I got it of course that one's not
[1:06:41] recorded and then questions and answers
[1:06:43] on the Holy Ghost and yet the one the
[1:06:45] third one that wasn't recorded that's
[1:06:47] all the way through the message that's
[1:06:49] all the way through but we know notice
[1:06:51] what brother brand would say here we are
[1:06:53] trying to bring our people into a better
[1:06:57] fellowship with Christ that's our
[1:07:02] purpose that's the whole goal is to
[1:07:05] bring our people into a better
[1:07:08] fellowship with Christ now were were the
[1:07:10] people not in fellowship with one
[1:07:12] another they were the people were in
[1:07:14] fellowship with one another but yet God
[1:07:17] laying the burden upon the prophet's
[1:07:19] heart for the church there to see that
[1:07:21] there was a need for a better Fellowship
[1:07:24] let me tell you friends I believe that's
[1:07:26] exactly what would burn in the heart of
[1:07:28] any real man of God and any believer it
[1:07:31] would burn in our hearts to want to see
[1:07:33] a better Fellowship he would want to see
[1:07:35] Lord God as we would pray for one
[1:07:37] another you know if Paul would even say
[1:07:39] we're praying for your Perfection you
[1:07:41] know there was a man by the name of
[1:07:43] epais he he wasn't known to preach
[1:07:45] meetings or anything like that but epap
[1:07:49] epais was such a man that he would pray
[1:07:51] Paul recognizes this he prayed for the
[1:07:54] church he prayed for the needs he saw
[1:07:57] the shortcomings he saw the things that
[1:08:00] was lacking and he did the greatest
[1:08:02] thing he could do and that was pray for
[1:08:04] the needs that he saw do you realize the
[1:08:06] moment you get away from real prayer is
[1:08:09] the moment you get away from
[1:08:12] expectation that's what brings
[1:08:14] expectation is prayer getting Before the
[1:08:17] Throne of God well I don't see nothing
[1:08:19] happening I don't see anything going
[1:08:21] wrong but you see when we get Before the
[1:08:23] Throne of God God has made you and I in
[1:08:26] a place to be able to intercede for one
[1:08:29] another and the needs that we see around
[1:08:31] us now watch this in Ephesians chapter 3
[1:08:35] verse 8 unto me watch how Paul writes
[1:08:38] this on this Fellowship Who Am less than
[1:08:40] the least of All Saints is this Grace
[1:08:43] given that I should preach among the
[1:08:45] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[1:08:49] Christ and to make all men see what is
[1:08:51] the Fellowship of the mystery which was
[1:08:54] from the beginning of of the world hath
[1:08:56] been hid in God who created All Things
[1:08:59] by Jesus Christ now notice what Paul is
[1:09:01] writing about his purpose the burden
[1:09:04] upon his heart remember Paul's Ministry
[1:09:07] was a Ministry to the Gentiles he would
[1:09:10] be given the light and illumination of
[1:09:13] divine revelation and Paul in his life
[1:09:16] would go forth and remember that men
[1:09:19] that Darkness would be turned away from
[1:09:21] light and that the Gentiles themselves
[1:09:23] would receive their call Paul that
[1:09:26] according to the mystery that God had
[1:09:29] hid all the whole time what is that
[1:09:31] mystery it's the mystery of God's own
[1:09:34] life that God himself would take a
[1:09:37] people and to think about it Paul would
[1:09:39] come not just with words but he came
[1:09:42] with the unction of the holy spirit
[1:09:45] because friends it'll take words it's
[1:09:47] God's not here to try to convince people
[1:09:49] God's not here to try to convince you or
[1:09:52] try to convince me you say what do you
[1:09:53] mean if you are persuaded by one you can
[1:09:56] be persuaded by somebody else God is not
[1:09:59] here that you would be conformed to the
[1:10:02] message but God's desire is that your
[1:10:05] life would be transformed that the
[1:10:08] spirit of God would so resonate on the
[1:10:10] inside to recognize who it is that's
[1:10:14] speaking to you and to recognize oh
[1:10:20] my
[1:10:22] test let's go over to the handheld
[1:10:30] man we're having a
[1:10:36] Time pray for I don't
[1:10:38] stutter I hate these
[1:10:41] [Laughter]
[1:10:43] lollipops gave me one the one time at
[1:10:45] brother Sean's meeing I said y'all just
[1:10:47] going to pray for I said Put it on a
[1:10:48] stand first and I'll preach with it on
[1:10:50] the stand CU if not I'll stutter a
[1:10:52] lot but you know think of this in this
[1:10:55] manner that this Fellowship this
[1:10:57] participation of God what God has
[1:11:00] desired and what he has called you and I
[1:11:02] to God's the one who makes it real he
[1:11:05] makes it clear to you and I lets us know
[1:11:07] that your life down here it's not about
[1:11:10] this life it's about that life that is
[1:11:12] to come that you're you're more than
[1:11:14] just a human being walking around or
[1:11:16] just you know a son and daughter of so
[1:11:18] and so but you're a son and daughter of
[1:11:20] God and you're not just become a son and
[1:11:22] daughter of God you always were a son
[1:11:24] and daughter of God you see God begins
[1:11:26] to let you know of who you really are
[1:11:29] that was the purpose Paul could say of
[1:11:31] the ministry that you might have
[1:11:33] Fellowship wi the mystery your
[1:11:36] participation your part in this mystery
[1:11:39] now I want you to think of it he says to
[1:11:41] the intent that now unto the
[1:11:43] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[1:11:45] places might be known by the church the
[1:11:48] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[1:11:51] Eternal purpose which he purposed in
[1:11:54] Christ Jesus our lord Lord in whom we
[1:11:56] have boldness and access with confidence
[1:12:00] by the faith of him now I want you to
[1:12:03] think of this in this manner as as the
[1:12:06] word would go forth and as the word has
[1:12:08] went forth down through every age it's
[1:12:10] God's desire to have Fellowship that
[1:12:12] Fellowship that he had clear back in the
[1:12:15] Garden of Eden we know what came in it
[1:12:17] was sin that came in that broke that
[1:12:20] Fellowship that God had with man and
[1:12:23] God's desire has been that man would
[1:12:25] come back into that place to bring man
[1:12:28] back into a place of Fellowship not just
[1:12:30] so much the where that God would talk
[1:12:32] face to face with man but the where that
[1:12:35] you in your life me in my life would
[1:12:38] actually be assembled as a part of the
[1:12:41] House of Prayer to actually be a
[1:12:44] tabernacle a dwelling place that God
[1:12:46] himself would dwell in you realize the
[1:12:48] prophet said and why Christ speak he
[1:12:50] said Jesus goes to church every single
[1:12:53] day he said he goes to Church in his
[1:12:56] people and he worships there oh my the
[1:13:00] Lord is listen he's living in the midst
[1:13:02] of his people he's living in hearts that
[1:13:05] he has redeemed he shed his own blood
[1:13:08] and his life has come into but to think
[1:13:10] of this Fellowship that even when a
[1:13:12] person whether it was an Israelite
[1:13:14] whether it was one who would be coming
[1:13:16] into the camp there was always things
[1:13:18] that God gave as a provision that would
[1:13:21] actually signify and speak of their
[1:13:24] acceptance or the acceptance of their
[1:13:26] faith and their Fellowship among the
[1:13:28] people watch how the prophet says this
[1:13:30] in what is the Holy Ghost he said any
[1:13:33] child that refused circumcision in the
[1:13:35] Old Testament which was a foreshadow of
[1:13:38] the Holy Ghost was cut off from amongst
[1:13:40] the people he could not have fellowship
[1:13:43] with the rest of the congregation if he
[1:13:45] refused to be circumcised now he says
[1:13:48] that pattern is today a person that
[1:13:51] would refuse to receive the baptism of
[1:13:54] the Holy Ghost can have no Fellowship
[1:13:57] among those that has the Holy Ghost you
[1:13:58] just can't do it you have to be of a
[1:14:01] nature now notice if when you think of
[1:14:03] this even when a person would come in
[1:14:06] let's say a person comes right in the
[1:14:08] door and here they'll come in the door
[1:14:09] and my just you know appreciate is the
[1:14:12] greeting you know and coming in and
[1:14:14] fellowshipping you know around and you
[1:14:16] know maybe here's they'll come in and
[1:14:18] they'll be baptized in the name of the
[1:14:20] Lord Jesus Christ they recognize wait a
[1:14:21] minute I need to repent of my sin the
[1:14:24] spirit of God bring conviction to their
[1:14:26] life and then here they are baptized in
[1:14:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ taking
[1:14:30] upon his identity now what does that
[1:14:33] bring them they are now in Fellowship
[1:14:36] among the local body of Believers but
[1:14:39] they have not been brought into the
[1:14:42] fellowship as far as into the body of
[1:14:45] Jesus Christ remember when brother Ram's
[1:14:48] nephew and the things was going on as a
[1:14:50] young man and brother Bram had to go
[1:14:51] down and correct that and some things
[1:14:53] and things that he had he had done and
[1:14:55] brother Ram goes down there and and his
[1:14:57] and and you know brother Ram is talking
[1:14:58] to him and said hey hey there's some
[1:15:00] things you know that's taking place
[1:15:01] that's wrong you know you're an Irishman
[1:15:03] you're a German and these things are
[1:15:05] taking place and you know these things
[1:15:07] aren't right here with your son that was
[1:15:09] his nephew and brother Brandon was
[1:15:11] standing there and as he's talking the
[1:15:13] father speaks up and says but my son
[1:15:16] he's come to the altar he's accepted
[1:15:19] Christ he's been baptized and the
[1:15:21] prophet said nothing wrong with that
[1:15:22] whatsoever he said that's true he has
[1:15:25] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ he's taking his identity
[1:15:31] among the Believers he said but until he
[1:15:34] is converted and fully regenerated he'll
[1:15:38] never be over to able to overcome those
[1:15:41] complexes in his life no matter how much
[1:15:44] mentally he tries to do it he's got to
[1:15:48] have a full work of redemption so I
[1:15:51] think it's wonderful let me just say
[1:15:53] this to you I think it's wonderful it
[1:15:55] ought to be something friends that that
[1:15:57] there should be hearts and lives that
[1:15:59] would feel a welcoming maybe there's
[1:16:01] something that they wouldn't get right
[1:16:03] away maybe it's weeks I don't know how
[1:16:05] long I I'm not here to run anybody away
[1:16:07] but I will say this I thank God if
[1:16:10] people can come and they can sense the
[1:16:12] love of God maybe they don't even know
[1:16:14] what it is but there's a welcoming
[1:16:16] Spirit that's here it's something that's
[1:16:18] peaceful it's a reality that's pointing
[1:16:20] them more than just trying to get them
[1:16:23] their names on a book or get them to to
[1:16:25] a church or get them to recite a Creed
[1:16:27] but something begins to move within
[1:16:29] their heart that hey this is something
[1:16:32] this is a living God that has a real
[1:16:34] interest in my soul hey this is not just
[1:16:37] something where we carry a Bible but
[1:16:40] it's a reality where the Bible is
[1:16:42] actually preached where the Holy Ghost
[1:16:44] is actually loosed Among Us and the
[1:16:47] spirit of God comes and he works in our
[1:16:49] life listen we want that kind of a
[1:16:53] fellowship but we don't want to stop
[1:16:56] there because just to stop there it's
[1:16:59] only a matter of
[1:17:00] time it's only a matter of time we can
[1:17:04] associate around my what a love listen
[1:17:06] friends I don't think there's a better
[1:17:07] group of
[1:17:09] people boy y'all
[1:17:11] quiet y y'all think there's a better
[1:17:13] group than
[1:17:14] yourselves I don't think there's a
[1:17:16] better group of people than the Bride of
[1:17:18] Jesus Christ oh yeah we got we got our
[1:17:20] shortcomings we we got our mistakes and
[1:17:22] our flaws we're not perfect people we
[1:17:24] got a perfect sacrifice a perfect blood
[1:17:27] that we've been made perfect through and
[1:17:29] by that sinless
[1:17:32] offering but to think about it to be
[1:17:35] able to come and fellowship tell me why
[1:17:37] it is I trust it's this way why is it
[1:17:39] that bosses or different ones or people
[1:17:42] would seek you out and desire to have
[1:17:44] you had desire you know certain things
[1:17:47] within the company well you say well
[1:17:48] brother Samuel that don't happen to
[1:17:49] Christians I beg to differ with you
[1:17:52] Joseph well Joseph himself God was with
[1:17:54] with him and God gave him favor come on
[1:17:57] friends sometimes the things that we
[1:17:59] look at and call persecution it's God
[1:18:01] wanting to mold and shape our character
[1:18:04] not pray things away but it's actually
[1:18:06] God wanting to help us to die more to
[1:18:08] ourselves because we needed to be mold
[1:18:11] and made into his own image that's sir
[1:18:14] is that right yes sir so when understand
[1:18:17] this that there's got to come something
[1:18:18] that goes deeper it's got to be
[1:18:20] something that sure thank God we walk
[1:18:22] into the Waters of baptism but if we
[1:18:25] refuse the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[1:18:27] don't need that I don't need that life
[1:18:29] I'm good as I am then we are refusing
[1:18:32] fellowship with almighty God and God
[1:18:35] will not God will not accept that and it
[1:18:38] actually will show in our life you know
[1:18:40] what you receive it'll show in your life
[1:18:43] what you reject it'll show in your life
[1:18:46] think of this the prophet says it like
[1:18:48] this he said my mother used to say birds
[1:18:50] of a feather flock together it's an old
[1:18:53] proverb but it's true you don't see
[1:18:55] doves and crows fellowshipping their
[1:18:58] diets are different their habits are
[1:19:01] different their desires are different
[1:19:03] now I've watched this many times over
[1:19:04] the years you know with preaching youth
[1:19:06] meetings and things I've watched how you
[1:19:08] can gather maybe 400 young people
[1:19:11] together and you know first of all when
[1:19:12] they get there you know they know
[1:19:14] certain ones and certain ones in their
[1:19:15] little Gatherings and so forth but you
[1:19:17] can just watch sometimes and understand
[1:19:19] me it's not the people but you'll watch
[1:19:22] certain things will start to congregate
[1:19:24] together you'll watch those who maybe
[1:19:26] don't want to be as serious and they're
[1:19:28] not there to be as serious God still
[1:19:30] works in those things to get a hold of
[1:19:32] their lives I've witnessed that but
[1:19:34] you'll watch certain things of how
[1:19:36] things will somehow get together you
[1:19:38] tell me how that happens it's because
[1:19:40] there's Spirits that's there and just a
[1:19:43] much just as much as the holy spirit
[1:19:45] will draw a group of people together and
[1:19:48] then there's lives I I don't know you
[1:19:49] know this talking on the spiritual level
[1:19:51] that's a that's a little too much for me
[1:19:53] you know I need something to talk a
[1:19:55] little bit of spiritual but I need them
[1:19:57] to talk a lot about gangs or about
[1:19:59] sports or about this I I need more of
[1:20:01] that I feel more comfortable but I I
[1:20:03] think it ought to be that when we're
[1:20:05] seeking out friends and fellowship we
[1:20:07] want somebody that they would be Christ
[1:20:09] in their life that would challenge in my
[1:20:11] life to live a little bit deeper the
[1:20:13] Bible said Iron sharpeneth Iron it ought
[1:20:17] to be something within our life that we
[1:20:19] fight against those Spirits I don't want
[1:20:21] to be mediocre I want to go on with God
[1:20:25] amen now notice this we don't see doves
[1:20:28] and crows cuz we can't doves and crows
[1:20:30] can't eat the same thing so what happens
[1:20:32] the diet itself actually becomes a
[1:20:35] display of whether there's real
[1:20:37] fellowship or a lack of Fellowship think
[1:20:39] about the Hebrew children when the
[1:20:41] Hebrew children themselves when they
[1:20:43] refused to go into the land of promise
[1:20:46] they made their own choice is that right
[1:20:49] when they made their own choice the 10
[1:20:50] spies and here the evidence came back
[1:20:53] and they made their choice they refused
[1:20:56] fellowship with God and when they
[1:20:59] refused that fellowship with God they
[1:21:01] walked for 40 years they walked around
[1:21:04] the same Mountain for 40 years let me
[1:21:08] tell you something friends if you don't
[1:21:10] accept God's provision you'll be left to
[1:21:13] wandering in the same spot over and over
[1:21:16] and over it don't matter how long you
[1:21:18] come to a message church it's about
[1:21:20] getting fully into Jesus Christ it's
[1:21:23] about his life changing you and when
[1:21:25] there's a life that's been changed on
[1:21:27] the inside and there's full Fellowship
[1:21:30] that everybody knows not because of how
[1:21:33] you carry your Bible not because of what
[1:21:35] you can quote not because of everything
[1:21:37] you can say but the life you live on a
[1:21:40] daily basis tells the fellowship that
[1:21:43] you
[1:21:44] have
[1:21:46] hallu see it's just like this lady oan
[1:21:49] age the lady oan age that we're in they
[1:21:52] claimed to have fellowship with God
[1:21:55] they claim to be in fellowship with him
[1:21:57] we're rich have need of nothing but you
[1:22:00] notice to be in Fellowship there's only
[1:22:03] one place of fellowship and that's under
[1:22:05] the blood is that right there's only one
[1:22:08] place of Fellowship it's not just not
[1:22:10] coming to a church it's getting under
[1:22:12] the blood that's what the real message
[1:22:15] of the hour that's listen that has been
[1:22:17] the call down through every age is come
[1:22:21] and get under the blood why because the
[1:22:23] blood itself listen this blood is not
[1:22:26] the Blood of Mary it was not the blood
[1:22:29] of Joseph this Blood was the blood of
[1:22:32] Christ it was not a polluted blood are
[1:22:34] you hearing me it was a blood the Bible
[1:22:37] it was God's own blood God created that
[1:22:40] blood cell for to do what to pay the
[1:22:43] price for you and I that when that blood
[1:22:45] would be shed that that life on the
[1:22:48] inside could come back on the worshipper
[1:22:50] and bring us into a place of fellowship
[1:22:53] with God
[1:22:55] amen where we stand as redeemed Sons and
[1:22:58] Daughters of God with the reality of the
[1:23:00] Holy Spirit burning in our hearts and
[1:23:03] our life expresses a fellowship with God
[1:23:06] but we look in this age that we're
[1:23:08] living in in this age of Lady OA they
[1:23:12] claim to have True Fellowship claim to
[1:23:14] be under the word of God they claim that
[1:23:17] there's you know oh we're there but yet
[1:23:21] they're not able to take every word of
[1:23:23] God and say Amen to it right right right
[1:23:26] now you know it'd be one thing for you
[1:23:27] and I and it all begins to be able to
[1:23:29] say Amen to every word of God but it
[1:23:33] takes something within that Soul that's
[1:23:36] able to stand there because the holy
[1:23:39] spirit is not a separate person from God
[1:23:42] it's not something separate from the
[1:23:44] word but the Holy Spirit itself is the
[1:23:46] word himself so how can the spirit of
[1:23:50] God dwell in a heart and out of that
[1:23:52] heart come a nail against the word how
[1:23:55] can there come a rejection against the
[1:23:57] word of God it's not the true Holy
[1:24:00] Spirit are you hearing me now you might
[1:24:02] have had the Holy Spirit on your spirit
[1:24:04] you might have spoken tongues you might
[1:24:06] have prophesied you could have done all
[1:24:08] those things but if that genuine Holy
[1:24:11] Spirit doesn't get down to where it
[1:24:13] needs to be listen friends you can do
[1:24:15] all of these things and still not be
[1:24:18] regenerated in the soul when there is a
[1:24:21] regeneration in the soul then it becomes
[1:24:23] a redeem means son and daughter of God
[1:24:26] is that right how The Prophet by the
[1:24:29] spirit of God labored on that in this
[1:24:31] hour where the Pentecostals running
[1:24:33] under the baptism of the Holy Spirit but
[1:24:36] they were not they were not willing to
[1:24:38] submit and then call to mind of what God
[1:24:41] was calling them to into a full
[1:24:43] Fellowship oh friends I'm afraid
[1:24:46] sometimes that that gets right around
[1:24:47] our message that we'll hold back on
[1:24:49] something of well you know I've seen
[1:24:51] this and I've seen this and and and you
[1:24:53] know this was revealed to me and and
[1:24:55] bless God I've got this gift that's the
[1:24:57] same thing that the Pentecostals done
[1:24:59] you see what it has to come back to the
[1:25:02] prophet said in the prisoner of Jesus
[1:25:03] Christ he said don't ever judge your
[1:25:05] life by how many gifts you have by all
[1:25:08] the Miracles in your life he said you
[1:25:10] judge your life by the fruits of the
[1:25:13] spirit and what is coming out of your
[1:25:16] life that's what we need to rest on rest
[1:25:19] on the word not a gift not a sensation
[1:25:22] we need to rest on the word word of
[1:25:25] God brother Samuel do you believe in
[1:25:27] Sensations I do do you believe in
[1:25:29] feelings I do but at the end of the day
[1:25:32] that is not what I'm resting on because
[1:25:35] when Sensations are gone feelings are
[1:25:37] gone there's got to be an anchor that's
[1:25:40] there with the word of God that I know
[1:25:42] in whom I have believed and my soul
[1:25:45] punctuates the word of God with an
[1:25:49] amen that's why we don't want just a
[1:25:51] baptism on our spirit you say why though
[1:25:54] that'll make you
[1:25:56] religious yeah
[1:26:01] indifferent but you want a real genuine
[1:26:03] birth that brings you into
[1:26:05] fellowship with
[1:26:07] God I want you to think of this full
[1:26:10] Fellowship think of this in 1
[1:26:12] Corinthians 12 verse
[1:26:15] 12 for as the body is one and hath many
[1:26:18] members and all the members of that body
[1:26:21] being many are one body
[1:26:24] so also is
[1:26:26] Christ for by one
[1:26:29] Spirit are we all
[1:26:31] baptized into one
[1:26:33] body whether we be
[1:26:36] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[1:26:40] free and have all have been all made to
[1:26:43] drink into one spirit for the body is
[1:26:47] not one member but
[1:26:50] many my what Ruth has been invited
[1:26:54] to what has been extended to her to come
[1:26:58] at meal time and have
[1:27:02] Fellowship now she would have Fellowship
[1:27:05] among the Believers that's true but the
[1:27:08] first part of it was to have Fellowship
[1:27:11] to feed upon the word of
[1:27:14] God now you know as we read this
[1:27:16] scripture here that for by one Spirit
[1:27:19] are we baptized into one body you know
[1:27:21] Lord willing here in a few moments
[1:27:23] brother t i we will
[1:27:26] baptize uh Sister Barbara and sister
[1:27:29] angelene desired to be re-baptized you
[1:27:32] realize of of the many that that that
[1:27:34] have been baptized or would would be
[1:27:36] baptized you know we can we can put them
[1:27:39] down into the water been many that we
[1:27:42] can put in water but oh my prayer was
[1:27:44] always Lord you place them in the body
[1:27:47] where they need to be Lord because only
[1:27:50] the spirit of God can baptize a life
[1:27:53] into the body I want you to think of
[1:27:55] this one time you know I was baptizing
[1:27:57] brother Andrew Glover and myself we were
[1:27:59] into the last meeting at byc and we were
[1:28:02] baptized and they had us doing it in a
[1:28:03] hor horse trough and man I'll tell you
[1:28:05] my back gave out on me brother Andrew
[1:28:08] pulled his hamstring and of course
[1:28:10] brother Lindsay McGrady said look at
[1:28:11] these two young guys he said injured
[1:28:13] baptizing you know and here we were
[1:28:15] standing over the side and brother
[1:28:17] Lindsay had to take cold you know and
[1:28:19] brother Andrew had to preach that night
[1:28:20] I I had ended that morning but you know
[1:28:22] as we were standing there I never forget
[1:28:23] you you know and and you know brother
[1:28:25] Lindsay and they're there watching you
[1:28:26] know and one time you know had this one
[1:28:28] little this young lady and you know
[1:28:30] you're you're putting them down in that
[1:28:31] horse trough and there's only so much
[1:28:32] room and you know we put them down in
[1:28:34] there and there was just you know
[1:28:35] brother Lindsay came said hey hey he
[1:28:37] said hey hey this this one girl did y
[1:28:39] all baptized there was one little spot
[1:28:40] on her forehead or her nose or something
[1:28:42] was sticking up and so forth so we went
[1:28:44] over and talked to her and all those
[1:28:46] things but I I say it for this regards
[1:28:48] that you know what that maybe as a
[1:28:50] person is baptizing you in water as much
[1:28:53] as we want to make sure that you are
[1:28:55] submerged because why that speaks of a
[1:28:58] death it speaks of a death and then
[1:29:01] raising out of there is speaking of an
[1:29:03] open testimony that I am no longer the
[1:29:06] same person I am going a different
[1:29:09] pathway I am a new person now you see
[1:29:12] when Jesus Christ himself when he comes
[1:29:15] to baptize the life into his own
[1:29:18] presence into his own life you don't
[1:29:20] have to worry about him leaving a finger
[1:29:22] out leaving a no go out leaving a spot
[1:29:25] of the forehead he gets everything
[1:29:28] submerged our life goes into a full
[1:29:31] submersion in Jesus Christ to where we
[1:29:34] come out and we are not the same people
[1:29:37] as we were before we are a new creation
[1:29:40] in Christ Jesus and then we're in a real
[1:29:44] fellowship with almighty God and the
[1:29:47] Lord Jesus Christ oh my look how the
[1:29:50] prophet says it like this I love this
[1:29:51] this about sent me in a spin yesterday
[1:29:54] out of Fellowship by Redemption brother
[1:29:56] says when God has borne you a new by the
[1:29:59] Holy Ghost he can only look upon you as
[1:30:02] a perfect work CZ he did it
[1:30:05] himself yes sir I had a spell with that
[1:30:08] one yesterday oh yeah glory amen amen he
[1:30:12] can't condemn you for you are his
[1:30:14] workmanship oh he said I feel like
[1:30:17] shouting like a Methodist think of it
[1:30:19] you are God's workmanship he did it by
[1:30:22] how Sovereign Grace
[1:30:24] not because you jumped not because you
[1:30:26] went to church not because you turned a
[1:30:28] new page but because God by his Mercy
[1:30:31] brought you into Christ and the
[1:30:34] fellowship and looks upon you as a
[1:30:36] perfect work of his own why because I
[1:30:40] bought him I present him into the blood
[1:30:42] and there is nothing wrong with my work
[1:30:45] you are God's
[1:30:48] workmanship Hallelujah you're not the
[1:30:50] workmanship of a church you're not the
[1:30:52] workmanship of a man
[1:30:54] you are the workmanship of almighty
[1:30:58] God it's God that has called you and I
[1:31:01] into this
[1:31:02] Fellowship that is so good now notice
[1:31:05] this here in the scriptures of when this
[1:31:07] Fellowship oh my what Fellowship that
[1:31:10] the the the disciples had with the Lord
[1:31:12] Jesus what Fellowship they had walking
[1:31:15] all of those those years there with him
[1:31:17] those those three some years that they
[1:31:20] had what times of Fellowship that they
[1:31:23] had what testimonies that they would
[1:31:25] have but yet you know what they did not
[1:31:28] have the perfect Fellowship that God was
[1:31:32] requiring they slept where he
[1:31:34] slept they ate fish that was
[1:31:37] miraculously caught they saw the
[1:31:40] Miracles they were part of it God would
[1:31:43] even use them yeah is that right God
[1:31:47] even used them where there was committed
[1:31:49] unto them the ministry and they went out
[1:31:51] two by two but yet they didn't not have
[1:31:54] the fellowship that God intended for him
[1:31:57] to have well how could that be because
[1:32:00] the sacrifice had not been offered yet
[1:32:03] and the life within there had not
[1:32:05] returned back into the worshipper so now
[1:32:09] here they come to to the day of
[1:32:11] Pentecost and this is where the spirit
[1:32:13] of God now coming and dividing itself
[1:32:17] and coming upon those 120 that were
[1:32:20] there in that upper room and what did
[1:32:21] they do as soon as the spirit of God had
[1:32:25] brought them into full Fellowship they
[1:32:27] were so settled in their position as
[1:32:31] Sons and Daughters of God that reality
[1:32:33] had struck their heart it was not just
[1:32:36] something they had saw and been an
[1:32:38] eyewitness to but they themselves had an
[1:32:41] experience in their own life listen
[1:32:43] friends it wasn't just the feeling of
[1:32:45] the pillar of fire they had an
[1:32:47] experience where it witnessed in their
[1:32:50] heart that they were no longer the same
[1:32:53] they had now can you imagine what how
[1:32:55] Peter felt that Peter had been delivered
[1:32:58] from where he was even before the grace
[1:33:00] that had called him after he had walked
[1:33:03] away and said I don't know him I don't
[1:33:05] know him I I don't know who you're
[1:33:06] talking about I ain't never been
[1:33:08] associated with that man and he began to
[1:33:10] say things that he shouldn't have said
[1:33:12] but notice the grace of God Called to
[1:33:14] Peter and not only called to him but now
[1:33:17] that same Grace had brought him into a
[1:33:20] place to where he was willing to
[1:33:22] prostrate his own love life surrender
[1:33:25] his own will just as the sacrifice had
[1:33:28] and the same life that was in that
[1:33:30] sacrifice came back in him and he had a
[1:33:33] witness that he had passed from Death
[1:33:35] unto life let me tell you something
[1:33:37] Peter didn't have to look over his
[1:33:38] shoulder and say man I hope I don't act
[1:33:41] like Peter used to act he had received
[1:33:44] an inoculation in his heart brother what
[1:33:47] had he done he had been
[1:33:49] circumcised from what he
[1:33:52] was he was in Fellowship yes and I'll
[1:33:56] tell you how much Fellowship he was in
[1:33:58] he became the
[1:34:01] spokesman when he began to speak the
[1:34:04] convicting power of the Holy Ghost be to
[1:34:06] move upon that audience and they said
[1:34:08] what must we do to be saved he said
[1:34:11] repent is that right and be baptized in
[1:34:14] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:34:17] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:34:20] receive the same Fellowship the gift of
[1:34:23] the Holy ghost I want you to think of
[1:34:25] this because Satan himself oh my how
[1:34:29] Satan he hates Fellowship he hates
[1:34:33] Unity you know even the demons don't get
[1:34:36] along you know brother Ram tells us that
[1:34:38] that's why you have these wars because
[1:34:40] every Spirit that's over a nation you
[1:34:42] say is is that true remember that Satan
[1:34:44] took Jesus up and showed him all the
[1:34:46] kingdoms of the world he said they're
[1:34:47] mine right if you Bow Down and Worship
[1:34:50] me you can have them we know that Daniel
[1:34:51] when Daniel was praying remember there
[1:34:53] was the Prince of Persia it wasn't a
[1:34:55] physical man it was a demon that was
[1:34:57] over that province is that right so how
[1:35:00] that these Spirits even in their
[1:35:01] position they will argue and they will
[1:35:03] debate and they will fuss and they will
[1:35:05] get upside upset this is how those Wars
[1:35:08] and everything else of course we know
[1:35:09] that it's all under the control of
[1:35:11] almighty God but notice within this this
[1:35:13] is one of the first places you'll find
[1:35:15] this word Fellowship mentioned in Acts
[1:35:18] chap 2 verse 42 it says they continued
[1:35:21] steadfastly in the apost Doctrine and
[1:35:25] fellowship and in Breaking of bread and
[1:35:28] in prayers now this is what receiving of
[1:35:31] the word had done in their life now when
[1:35:34] I'm talking about receiving the word I'm
[1:35:36] talking about receiving the spirit of
[1:35:38] God this is the very first time that
[1:35:40] it's me they continued in Fellowship not
[1:35:43] just in prayers not just in breaking a
[1:35:46] bread but in
[1:35:47] Fellowship they were in fellowship with
[1:35:50] God first of all and because of that
[1:35:53] Fellowship with God is what allowed them
[1:35:55] to have the right kind of fellowship
[1:35:57] with one another you see friends that's
[1:36:00] the right Source even when you look at
[1:36:02] this among your families you can say
[1:36:05] well you know I'm I'm the daddy or I'm
[1:36:06] the mom I'm the husband I'm the wife and
[1:36:08] you can look at it in that way but you
[1:36:10] got to remember who gave you that office
[1:36:13] and that
[1:36:14] attribute God gave you that office God
[1:36:17] gave you that attribute and the only way
[1:36:19] you'll ever be able to rightfully
[1:36:21] fulfill that attribute is you have to be
[1:36:24] in fellowship with the source of him who
[1:36:28] is the Fountain of all of those
[1:36:30] attributes staying in that place that
[1:36:32] God let me be the husband that you would
[1:36:35] have me to be Lord help me to understand
[1:36:37] as you pray over things regarding your
[1:36:39] wife and you're praying Lord help me to
[1:36:41] understand help me Lord to minister
[1:36:43] things that you see weaknesses and need
[1:36:45] and vice versa the wife to the husband
[1:36:47] even as you pray over your children and
[1:36:49] and you're praying and you're
[1:36:51] interceding on that behalf now I want
[1:36:53] you to think of this Fellowship the
[1:36:55] prophet says it like this and I will
[1:36:57] restore in 1957 he said the first thing
[1:37:00] that Pentecost produced was Brotherly
[1:37:04] Love Now I want you to look at these
[1:37:06] words carefully the first thing it
[1:37:09] produced was brotherly love it tore down
[1:37:14] the middle wall of partitions and made a
[1:37:18] Brotherhood so it was not these people
[1:37:21] making a Brotherhood it was was not
[1:37:24] these people making themselves this is
[1:37:27] what was
[1:37:29] produced out of
[1:37:31] Pentecost you see that's why that you
[1:37:33] and I cannot produce the love of God it
[1:37:37] takes the love of God in our soul and it
[1:37:41] takes surrendering to the love of God
[1:37:44] and I'll tell you what just as the
[1:37:46] prophet would say it over and over and
[1:37:47] over through the message he would say it
[1:37:49] in many different angles same way though
[1:37:51] same things we need more of the love of
[1:37:54] God we need a continual baptism with the
[1:37:57] love of God I want more of the love of
[1:37:59] God I want more of it to take over more
[1:38:02] of Samuel I see too much Samuel I want
[1:38:04] to see more of
[1:38:06] him notice he says it made a Brotherhood
[1:38:10] to such a way that they had everything
[1:38:12] in common in the Bible days of
[1:38:15] Brotherhood and Paul spoke of this
[1:38:17] Brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of
[1:38:19] the Pentecostal Church as he said in 1
[1:38:21] Corinthians 13 though I speak with
[1:38:23] tongues as men and angels and have not
[1:38:25] this love which brings the Brotherhood I
[1:38:29] am nothing and though I have knowledge
[1:38:31] to understand all the mysteries of God I
[1:38:34] am still nothing without love the love
[1:38:38] of the
[1:38:40] Brethren now what you reckon you reckon
[1:38:42] this is just the love of the Brethren
[1:38:43] that agree with me no is that what the
[1:38:47] Brotherhood
[1:38:48] is that's called a
[1:38:51] click that's called a clan that's good
[1:38:54] that's what that's called that's not a
[1:38:56] Brotherhood because a real listen where
[1:38:59] the spirit of God would create such a
[1:39:01] Brotherhood we could be able to stand
[1:39:04] and
[1:39:04] disagree and still be able to stand as
[1:39:09] brothers is that
[1:39:11] right oh brother Samuel oh my let me
[1:39:14] just go on here for a little bit Jesus
[1:39:17] said this will all men know that you're
[1:39:19] my disciples when you have love one one
[1:39:24] for the other Pentecost had that I'm
[1:39:27] speaking of Pentecost meaning the first
[1:39:29] group of the Apostles and the disciples
[1:39:32] they had that Brotherly Love they wasn't
[1:39:35] greedy watch this they sold everything
[1:39:37] they had for the furthering of the
[1:39:40] church notice what Pentecost produced
[1:39:43] was a Brotherly Love It produced in
[1:39:46] their life where it no longer was about
[1:39:49] self it was about the furthering of the
[1:39:51] Church of the Living God it was not
[1:39:54] about me and my and well I tell you what
[1:39:56] what what what can you give my family no
[1:39:58] it wasn't about that it was about they
[1:40:00] had such come in such a contact with one
[1:40:04] who had so done such a work in their
[1:40:06] life that they did not deserve it they
[1:40:09] were unlovable but the grace of God came
[1:40:12] down and made them lovable and had
[1:40:14] birthed such a reality of the love of
[1:40:16] God in their hearts it was no longer a
[1:40:19] life about self let me tell you that is
[1:40:22] the Apex of where God is bringing a
[1:40:25] church in this hour to where we become
[1:40:28] so delivered of our own self our own
[1:40:31] ideas our own opinions or you say will
[1:40:34] we have them yes but we will have the
[1:40:36] grace of God to say that doesn't matter
[1:40:39] when it comes to the body of Jesus
[1:40:43] Christ that's what this Capstone
[1:40:45] Ministry brings us
[1:40:48] to Hallelujah notice this is why Paul
[1:40:51] would write let Brotherly Love
[1:40:56] continue I love that
[1:41:00] scripture let let it continue notice
[1:41:03] it's entrusted to you and I let that
[1:41:06] same Brotherly Love let let it continue
[1:41:08] don't stifle it let it continue let it
[1:41:12] abound let it
[1:41:14] increase let it move in our life but
[1:41:16] remember brother B says here that first
[1:41:18] church he said there was a fellow that
[1:41:20] came in by the name of a Palmer worm and
[1:41:23] when he begin to eat on that vine of
[1:41:24] Brotherly Love he cut the very sap line
[1:41:27] of it because it don't make a difference
[1:41:29] how smart we are how much we think we
[1:41:32] know or how much we want to be different
[1:41:34] from somebody else as long as that
[1:41:36] brotherly feeling isn't among us we're
[1:41:40] fighting a losing
[1:41:43] battle amen as long as that brotherly
[1:41:47] feeling is not among us now we've been
[1:41:52] preaching on this with feeding and
[1:41:54] recognizing how God would direct us on
[1:41:56] that you realize that when you look
[1:41:57] through the old test through the New
[1:42:00] Testament and you realize that every
[1:42:03] Church even through the New Testament
[1:42:06] had its strengths had its weaknesses
[1:42:09] just like every Church yeah every church
[1:42:11] has its strengths and
[1:42:13] weaknesses you remember that how when
[1:42:15] you look at with the Corinthian Church
[1:42:19] well they were they had been you know
[1:42:22] really gifted you were a really gifted
[1:42:23] group of
[1:42:25] people they had I mean many gifts among
[1:42:28] them great
[1:42:30] understandings but yet there was a
[1:42:35] lacking because Paul would point out
[1:42:38] everything they were
[1:42:40] doing it was under the pressure to do
[1:42:43] something to edify
[1:42:46] self and not the rest of the body when
[1:42:49] you come together I've got to speak in
[1:42:51] tongues I've got to do this and I've got
[1:42:54] to do this and I've got there's a lot of
[1:42:56] things weaknesses but let me just say
[1:42:57] this to you don't look down on the
[1:42:59] Corinthian Church because remember every
[1:43:01] church has strengths and weaknesses and
[1:43:03] if it had not been for the weaknesses in
[1:43:05] that church we wouldn't have the
[1:43:07] teaching that we have on
[1:43:09] gifts is that right we wouldn't have
[1:43:11] that so what did God do God took where
[1:43:13] was weaknesses and he led them to feed
[1:43:16] upon those things you take for example
[1:43:19] even when it comes to the galatian
[1:43:20] church the galatian church wow they you
[1:43:23] know they they themselves had weaknesses
[1:43:26] the weaknesses being moved you know
[1:43:27] being fickle and being you know back and
[1:43:30] forth and and looking you know being
[1:43:31] moved over to this place that's the kind
[1:43:33] of people they were but you think of how
[1:43:35] that God even chose them of being those
[1:43:38] of the GS but God by his grace would
[1:43:40] bring them to a place of such a
[1:43:43] foundation in his economy remember they
[1:43:45] were moved over to legalism and going
[1:43:47] back judaizers had come down there and
[1:43:50] Men Paul called them false Brethren had
[1:43:52] got in among them and things like that
[1:43:54] then you take the Ephesian Church my
[1:43:56] everybody looks and says glory to God
[1:43:58] the Ephesian church but remember the
[1:43:59] Ephesian Church oh my they wer in such
[1:44:01] heavenlies they didn't even know how to
[1:44:03] live an Earthly life they didn't know
[1:44:04] how to you know when it come down to
[1:44:06] conducting and you know working with
[1:44:07] husband and wife and how to love one
[1:44:09] another how to really live a domestic
[1:44:11] life and all of those things that hey
[1:44:13] this is why Paul would bring them over
[1:44:14] there's a battle that you have to battle
[1:44:16] through each and every day it's a battle
[1:44:18] for Heavenly places so every one of them
[1:44:21] had strengths and weaknesses in their
[1:44:23] own life or in their own church now I
[1:44:25] want you to notice how Paul writes this
[1:44:27] here in 1 Corinthians chap 1 and verse 9
[1:44:31] Paul said God is faithful by whom ye
[1:44:34] were called unto the fellowship of his
[1:44:37] son Jesus Christ Our Lord aren't you
[1:44:40] glad God is
[1:44:41] faithful God is faithful God is faithful
[1:44:44] to oversee his church and to work within
[1:44:47] our lives but notice in 1 Corinthians
[1:44:49] the vers next verse in verse 10 Paul
[1:44:51] said I beseech you breth by the name of
[1:44:54] our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak
[1:44:57] the same thing and that there be no
[1:44:59] divisions among you but that you be
[1:45:01] perfectly joined together in the same
[1:45:04] mind and in the same judgment for it
[1:45:06] hath been declared unto you my my
[1:45:09] brethren by them which are of the House
[1:45:11] of Khloe that there are contentions
[1:45:13] among you now he says every one of you
[1:45:16] some of you will say I'm of Paul one say
[1:45:18] I'm of Apollos one says I'm of sephus I
[1:45:20] of Christ but is Christ divided was Paul
[1:45:23] crucified for you or were you baptized
[1:45:26] in the name of Paul now notice these
[1:45:30] contentions had come among a body of
[1:45:35] Believers to do what to try to pull them
[1:45:39] away from a real true
[1:45:42] Fellowship now let me tell you something
[1:45:45] this arguing could not have been there
[1:45:48] if they were drawing from the right
[1:45:51] Source now let me explain that you say
[1:45:54] brother Samy you're saying that these
[1:45:56] there were there were Believers whoever
[1:45:57] was caught in this they weren't genuine
[1:45:59] believers they weren't really sealed
[1:46:01] Believers that's not what I'm saying at
[1:46:03] all if you remember Paul says even
[1:46:06] throughout the Book of Corinthians he
[1:46:08] said when I wanted to feed you with meat
[1:46:10] meaning that they could have been fed
[1:46:12] with meat but because of certain things
[1:46:15] that they had not matured in and grown
[1:46:18] over he says you're in need of milk
[1:46:20] aren't you glad that God don't shove
[1:46:21] meat down your throat but God will come
[1:46:24] and Minister milk where you and I need
[1:46:26] milk simple sincere truths to minister
[1:46:30] to us why we'll get from milk to meat
[1:46:33] but you see the whole purpose is is that
[1:46:35] we would grow in him and this is why
[1:46:38] remember how it was when you were
[1:46:39] younger and you fight for the for the
[1:46:41] seat next to the door Ma you wanted that
[1:46:43] seat next to the door or maybe you
[1:46:45] called shotgun when you went with Mama
[1:46:47] to the store man you were getting that
[1:46:49] seat up front all the rest of the
[1:46:50] siblings were getting back there and my
[1:46:52] would run there and maybe if you got the
[1:46:54] door the same time you'd be sitting
[1:46:56] there and you'd open the door no I got
[1:46:57] here first and I got here first and here
[1:47:00] you are you know you're you're going
[1:47:01] along with it and maybe you know you
[1:47:03] grew up a little bit and you're 15 years
[1:47:05] old and you're still calling shotgun and
[1:47:07] and you're out running the 5year olds to
[1:47:09] get there you know to the seat and and
[1:47:11] finally you get to a spot in life you're
[1:47:13] like I don't care if I got a ride in the
[1:47:15] trunk I'm going with Mom
[1:47:17] anyhow you say what happened maturing
[1:47:21] amen you realize the certain things that
[1:47:23] used to matter that we made matter that
[1:47:26] we made matter that we made matter right
[1:47:31] it really don't matter that's right it
[1:47:33] really don't
[1:47:34] matter and we realized good Lord I had
[1:47:37] such vexation of spirit over calling
[1:47:39] shotgun I sweated so much I did all this
[1:47:43] and even after I'd get the front seat I
[1:47:45] could tell my siblings look where I'm at
[1:47:47] look where I'm at M I'm up here next to
[1:47:49] Mama and they could say oh you you
[1:47:51] cheated you ran I did not stop saying
[1:47:53] that I you see what happens is you grow
[1:47:56] above
[1:47:58] indifferences listen friends that's what
[1:48:00] the Capstone does it's drawing us up
[1:48:03] beyond our own
[1:48:06] self you know what that does it draws us
[1:48:09] even above our own
[1:48:12] excuses that's what really becomes the
[1:48:14] culprit it draws us above all of that
[1:48:16] remember we are always Sons and
[1:48:18] Daughters of God we want to shout when
[1:48:21] Oh Glory to God I'm called a son of
[1:48:22] daughter of God but in a trial in a test
[1:48:25] I'm a son and daughter of God when
[1:48:26] things are not going my way I'm a son
[1:48:28] I'm a daughter of God is that right
[1:48:30] that's always the trajectory don't ever
[1:48:33] let the enemy call you back down well
[1:48:35] this is how I was raised and this is
[1:48:36] what happened to me younger no I'm going
[1:48:38] to stand there with The True Confession
[1:48:40] cuz he's the Apostle and high priest of
[1:48:43] my confession I'm not going to live and
[1:48:45] just use my natural birth when it's
[1:48:47] convenient for me and then claim a
[1:48:49] spiritual birth in another time I'm
[1:48:51] going to hang on to what the the spirit
[1:48:53] of God has revealed to me as a son and
[1:48:55] daughter of God you love him yes sir oh
[1:48:59] my that is good my my we're just going
[1:49:03] to have to stop
[1:49:07] here when Paul would write
[1:49:10] this in other words speak the same
[1:49:15] thing that doesn't mean we send out a
[1:49:17] track and then everybody reads it and we
[1:49:19] memorize it it's not what he's saying no
[1:49:24] but Paul is calling them back to what
[1:49:27] the real reality what you need to be
[1:49:29] looking at that Christ himself the word
[1:49:34] is our
[1:49:35] absolute now don't doubt these these
[1:49:37] individuals no doubt maybe they had
[1:49:39] maybe they had an affinity with Paul
[1:49:42] let's just say it like that they had an
[1:49:43] affinity with Peter they had Affinity
[1:49:46] with different
[1:49:47] ones and maybe then through that
[1:49:49] affinity and different things they had
[1:49:51] let just those different es get in and
[1:49:53] those opinions and they had allowed the
[1:49:56] opinions to be more than the
[1:50:00] Brotherhood they had allowed their
[1:50:03] opinions to separate them they were
[1:50:07] sitting in the same church as it were
[1:50:11] but they were as divided as divided
[1:50:14] could be why it was a lack of Fellowship
[1:50:19] you see because we can't be
[1:50:23] in fellowship with God as we ought to be
[1:50:27] and be out of fellowship with one
[1:50:30] another are you hearing me you you you
[1:50:33] can't be in fellowship with God and say
[1:50:35] I don't like this brother listen friends
[1:50:37] you might say brother Samuel are you
[1:50:38] saying that we may not that that I don't
[1:50:40] have that in my soul I I I'm not saying
[1:50:42] that but what I am saying this right
[1:50:44] here the only way that you can have the
[1:50:48] right kind of feeling towards one
[1:50:49] another is to have fellowship with him
[1:50:52] and stay in fellowship with him let me
[1:50:55] tell you one of the great miracles about
[1:50:57] brother brandom's
[1:51:01] life brother Billy Paul in a book I have
[1:51:04] at
[1:51:07] home that he was asked the
[1:51:10] question in an interview what's the
[1:51:13] greatest
[1:51:14] miracle in brother bram's
[1:51:16] life he saw
[1:51:19] many they said the greatest Miracle I'd
[1:51:21] have to say
[1:51:23] he says I could not tell his friends
[1:51:27] from his enemies
[1:51:29] amen wow you say is that
[1:51:32] scripture look when Jesus and
[1:51:36] Judas that's good is that right yes sir
[1:51:40] when they sat around the Last
[1:51:42] Supper there was no inclination that had
[1:51:45] ever been
[1:51:47] given I seen Jesus look at him a little
[1:51:50] funny I seen Jesus walk by him
[1:51:53] I seen Jesus give him the eye I seen him
[1:51:56] glare no no remember don't fall back on
[1:52:00] your flesh now that's right don't fall
[1:52:03] back on that if you've got a birth on
[1:52:05] the inside you've got a strength on the
[1:52:08] inside that I can do all things through
[1:52:10] Christ that strengthens me yes
[1:52:13] sir I tell you it ought to be the prayer
[1:52:15] of things oh I'll tell you what of all
[1:52:17] those Miracles like that of all the
[1:52:19] Miracles could be done I tell you when I
[1:52:21] read it in that way like that I said God
[1:52:22] let that be the testimony in my life
[1:52:25] like the testimony was with the Lord
[1:52:27] Jesus where you couldn't tell that Judas
[1:52:29] was the one matter of fact all the rest
[1:52:31] of them questioned themselves and said
[1:52:33] am I the one is it I that's good am I
[1:52:36] the one see there was nothing that could
[1:52:39] give anything
[1:52:42] away brother Samuel what what will
[1:52:44] produce that the Holy Ghost amen you see
[1:52:47] it's the right source of Fellowship amen
[1:52:51] and when we have the right source of
[1:52:53] Fellowship it produces in our life
[1:52:57] what's needed thank you Lord than you
[1:52:59] Lord this is why brother brm says he
[1:53:01] says what happened in the beginning when
[1:53:03] Adam and Eve separated from
[1:53:07] fellowship by disbelieving one word of
[1:53:10] God I want you to think how powerful
[1:53:13] that is disbelieving just one word of
[1:53:16] God and then after doing that it brought
[1:53:21] separation said brother Samuel how
[1:53:23] simple could that be of when the Holy
[1:53:25] Spirit is speaking to your heart and
[1:53:28] dealing with your life the Holy Spirit
[1:53:31] would love for you to say that's just
[1:53:33] brother Samuel that's just a man let me
[1:53:36] just tell you friends if the male itself
[1:53:39] speaks to your life don't look at the
[1:53:43] messenger just accept the male and say
[1:53:47] Lord I'm going to say Amen to the word
[1:53:50] of God I'm going to over ride where my
[1:53:53] flesh wants to get in the way my flesh
[1:53:55] wants to rise up remember Ruth it ha
[1:53:57] been shown how you have left the land of
[1:53:59] your Nativity don't go back to it don't
[1:54:02] look back to it but keep going where God
[1:54:05] has called you
[1:54:07] to when they separated from it it
[1:54:10] allowed sin it allowed malice it allowed
[1:54:14] allowed Envy Strife all these things to
[1:54:17] enter in because why the prophet said
[1:54:21] when they got away from Divine
[1:54:26] love when they got away from Divine Love
[1:54:29] Now Divine love didn't get away from
[1:54:31] them they got away from it say Brother
[1:54:34] Sam how simple is that well just one
[1:54:38] step away from the word of
[1:54:40] God just just neglect even neglect in
[1:54:44] our
[1:54:45] life and fellowshipping with him you
[1:54:48] know he wants to fellowship with you he
[1:54:51] wants to have Fellowship yes and listen
[1:54:54] friends please don't misunderstand me
[1:54:56] but sometimes a person could pray for
[1:54:58] two hours and not have a lick of
[1:55:00] Fellowship because they'll never they
[1:55:02] never get beyond the things of of
[1:55:05] themselves but it's really entering into
[1:55:08] God it's really saying Lord you say how
[1:55:11] would you say that because if you come
[1:55:13] out of prayer and you feel the same
[1:55:17] way the same things are there you you
[1:55:19] didn't get off of the
[1:55:21] earth that that's where we have to press
[1:55:23] anybody hear me that's where we have to
[1:55:25] press in this day that we're living in
[1:55:27] we have to press Lord I don't want to
[1:55:29] come out of here this time with you Lord
[1:55:31] I I want to be changed I want to be
[1:55:34] strengthened Lord I want to come into
[1:55:35] that place brother B says you know how
[1:55:37] we know that we get to that place is
[1:55:39] when we are no longer complaining about
[1:55:42] maybe someone that we're bringing Before
[1:55:44] the Throne but now we're actually
[1:55:46] standing in and interceding for them
[1:55:48] that Lord they didn't mean to do that
[1:55:50] that's not my brother that's not my
[1:55:52] sister he said that's when we're getting
[1:55:55] Before the Throne of God In Prayer I
[1:55:59] believe God's called us to that
[1:56:00] Fellowship don't you sir oh my that's a
[1:56:03] real Brotherhood yes sir and listen
[1:56:06] friends that's what we want to contend
[1:56:07] for with all of our hearts we want to
[1:56:10] contend for it that God would be
[1:56:14] preeminent in each of Our Lives among
[1:56:16] our hearts amen let that Fellowship let
[1:56:19] it so rain in our life may we draw from
[1:56:22] that source of True
[1:56:24] Fellowship let's bow our
[1:56:29] heads Heavenly
[1:56:32] Father Lord as we just we thank you for
[1:56:35] your mercies Lord once again this
[1:56:39] morning Lord we thank you Father
[1:56:42] for your presence Lord and how that you
[1:56:44] would come Lord among
[1:56:47] us what a very very simple thought and
[1:56:51] even the things Lord that you've dealt
[1:56:53] with my heart for some time
[1:56:55] and Lord just looking that upon these
[1:56:59] things Lord
[1:57:01] God father I thank you for your mercy I
[1:57:04] thank you Lord that the spirit of God
[1:57:07] lord calling out Lord to hearts and to
[1:57:09] lives Lord even aresh Lord to lives that
[1:57:13] maybe Lord they've come Lord God
[1:57:17] gathered in Lord among the assembly and
[1:57:19] I'm thankful Lord that there is De God a
[1:57:22] welcoming
[1:57:24] Spirit Lord a welcoming dear God of the
[1:57:27] Holy Spirit I than Lord
[1:57:29] that as it was in the time lord when the
[1:57:32] Pharisees nobody wanted to be around
[1:57:34] them nobody did but I read Lord in the
[1:57:38] scriptures where it talks about how the
[1:57:40] publicans the Sinners and Luke 15 they
[1:57:44] come and they gathered around
[1:57:46] you there was a
[1:57:49] reason because there was life
[1:57:52] there was
[1:57:54] life Lord God it was not someone or
[1:57:57] something looking down on them but it
[1:58:00] was life that was calling him there was
[1:58:03] a call that was
[1:58:05] going Lord we thank you for
[1:58:08] that may that be Lord God I pray the
[1:58:11] call that comes out of our life no
[1:58:13] matter how far that Lord someone may
[1:58:17] feel that they've gone how lost that
[1:58:20] they might feel
[1:58:22] maybe Lord of how many times that they
[1:58:24] have failed you they've tried but I pray
[1:58:28] God May the spirit of God like John
[1:58:32] would write the fellowship that you
[1:58:34] might have this fellowship with us and
[1:58:38] truly our fellowship is with the father
[1:58:41] and with his
[1:58:43] son Christ
[1:58:45] Jesus Lord God as the spirit of God
[1:58:48] calls
[1:58:49] out the lives and hearts Lord
[1:58:53] might have Lord that
[1:58:55] Fellowship I pray that Lord if there's
[1:58:57] one here this
[1:58:58] morning that doesn't know you Lord in
[1:59:01] that
[1:59:02] way maybe Lord they've known you in a
[1:59:05] church maybe they've known you Lord
[1:59:08] in just in a way that's been up and down
[1:59:12] they felt your presence oh
[1:59:15] yeah maybe even things Lord that you've
[1:59:18] allowed them to do under that anointing
[1:59:23] but God they've never come into that
[1:59:25] place of a real fellowship with you a
[1:59:29] real spiritual death to self dying to
[1:59:33] self and being born of the spirit of
[1:59:36] God what I pray this
[1:59:40] morning may that Lord God I pray have
[1:59:42] been the reality that's placed before
[1:59:45] him Lord would speak to their hearts
[1:59:48] Lord God to let them know there is a
[1:59:51] place where no matter Lord how great the
[1:59:53] sin is no matter Lord the life that's
[1:59:56] been lived there's a place there's a
[1:59:59] place that can take
[2:00:01] care of sin it can take care of sin
[2:00:07] nature there's a place Lord and that
[2:00:10] place is under the shed blood of the
[2:00:12] Lamb Lord God when we walk in one
[2:00:15] way and we walk out a
[2:00:20] changed person Lord
[2:00:24] Lord to draw from that
[2:00:27] fountain that we might walk in a
[2:00:31] fellowship with
[2:00:33] you and having that fellowship with one
[2:00:39] another Lord to realize
[2:00:42] that I can't say that I love
[2:00:46] you and then I hate my
[2:00:50] brother I just read Lord where your
[2:00:52] Prophet said this week he said one of
[2:00:54] the greatest evidences I know that I've
[2:00:57] passed from Death unto
[2:00:58] life is even when my brethren that
[2:01:02] disagree with me over this message that
[2:01:05] I'm bringing I still love
[2:01:10] them oh Lord
[2:01:14] Jesus I pray God give us more of that
[2:01:17] love Lord may we sink deeper and deeper
[2:01:23] into the love of
[2:01:25] God granted lord it's more of you Lord
[2:01:29] that we
[2:01:31] need or to draw from that source of real
[2:01:36] Fellowship oh God that it works
[2:01:39] throughout the
[2:01:40] body I thank Lord of how the prophet
[2:01:43] would express it and humble thyself he
[2:01:45] said when the church had first started
[2:01:48] there on Athan
[2:01:50] pin of how that Lord and and even prior
[2:01:53] to that when they were gathering up
[2:01:54] there in
[2:01:55] that that little building was Uptown in
[2:02:01] Jeffersonville people would come around
[2:02:03] and they would so amused how do you get
[2:02:06] people to love like
[2:02:09] this
[2:02:11] how Lord your Prophet had such a simple
[2:02:15] answer he never said that we have
[2:02:20] seminars we have great
[2:02:23] teachings he said we preach the
[2:02:27] gospel we preach the love of God the
[2:02:31] Holy
[2:02:32] Spirit oh Lord it wasn't at times just
[2:02:35] like even among us as your children
[2:02:39] you're faithful that's what the
[2:02:40] scripture I read here God is faithful to
[2:02:43] see us through he who called us into
[2:02:45] Fellowship will see us through it isn't
[2:02:49] Lord that at times that we haven't been
[2:02:51] corrected
[2:02:52] and won't need to be corrected but we
[2:02:55] want to grow up into you in all things
[2:02:58] Lord we want to grow past indifferences
[2:03:01] Lord we want to grow past Lord to where
[2:03:05] that our opinions mean
[2:03:08] something we want to grow past our own
[2:03:13] ideas we want to grow past that Lord not
[2:03:16] that we might not still have our own
[2:03:19] thoughts or opinions but when it comes
[2:03:21] to to the body of Jesus Christ no matter
[2:03:24] what I think and no matter what I feel
[2:03:26] the body of Jesus Christ is greater than
[2:03:30] me the gro of Jesus Christ is more than
[2:03:35] my opinion my
[2:03:38] idea Grant it Lord May the spirit of
[2:03:41] God Lord God moving Among Us that
[2:03:44] produces that
[2:03:47] Brotherhood I pray Lord if there's any
[2:03:50] Lord any Lord that's got a little cold a
[2:03:53] little indifferent Lord may I pray God
[2:03:56] your spirit just moving even right now
[2:03:59] Lord just to move upon those cold places
[2:04:02] Lord May the spirit of God the great
[2:04:05] love of God just moving down lord and to
[2:04:07] warm every area of our life Lord God we
[2:04:11] need you Lord we're here as your sheep
[2:04:15] father and Lord like Ruth oh my no doubt

[2:20:05] baptized but when God really got a hold
[2:20:07] of my life when I was 19 years old it
[2:20:10] just meant something different it was
[2:20:13] something I knew that what what God was
[2:20:15] doing and where he brought me to and you
[2:20:17] know and that's the thing that we've
[2:20:19] we've always stood upon that if there's

[2:35:48] leading my way
[2:35:52] and have mercy on
[2:35:54] me I started the journey very
[2:35:59] well but because Satan doesn't want to
[2:36:04] see a child of God happy then he did all
[2:36:07] he
[2:36:09] could to take me back
[2:36:13] down I arrived here to
[2:36:16] America I came with my auntie
[2:36:21] I started Living a miserable
[2:36:24] [Music]
[2:36:26] life I got on point to which to
[2:36:31] die because I asked
[2:36:34] myself what is happening in my
[2:36:41] life God never
[2:36:43] promised a child of his to suffer
[2:36:49] [Music]
[2:36:50] I started Living a bad
[2:36:56] life until I felt like I am not
[2:37:01] deserved to call the child of
[2:37:05] God sometimes it gets on point to
[2:37:09] pray I feel like I can't cuz I don't
[2:37:13] have
[2:37:15] strength anytime I try to kneel down I
[2:37:18] feel I'm Stu
[2:37:29] [Music]
[2:37:30] somewhere but one
[2:37:33] day I was listening to a message Simon
[2:37:37] of brother William Mario
[2:37:40] Bram he was preaching about
[2:37:45] forgiveness and he gave an example of a
[2:37:48] person
[2:37:51] that he was in
[2:37:54] prison he was about to die they
[2:37:57] sentenced him to
[2:38:00] death but the
[2:38:02] governor stood up and told him you are
[2:38:08] free you are free to go but he could not
[2:38:13] believe because he was already ready he
[2:38:17] know that I'm going to die
[2:38:20] he never believed him and he asked him
[2:38:23] how is that
[2:38:24] possible that I'm about to live and be
[2:38:28] free brother brandham
[2:38:31] said no matter
[2:38:34] what no matter how is your
[2:38:38] sin but if you can accept the
[2:38:43] pardon you are
[2:38:46] free no matter what you have done in
[2:38:49] your life prostitution
[2:38:52] drinking
[2:38:53] [Music]
[2:38:56] lies but once we accept them for to be

[2:39:03] go let give me
[2:39:06] strength I pray to God I ask God please
[2:39:10] give me just last
[2:39:16] chance give me last chance

[2:39:36] said there is no relationship between a
[2:39:40] Believer and
[2:39:43] unbeliever I knew it
[2:39:47] but I ran
[2:39:51] from the face of Lord and wanted to do
[2:39:53] my
[2:39:54] [Music]
[2:39:57] way but today I am
[2:40:02] here I prayed so
[2:40:04] hard on point I feel like I don't even
[2:40:08] deserve to pray cuz even though I pray
[2:40:11] God will never forgive
[2:40:14] me he will never forgive me cuz all I
[2:40:17] have done in my life
