[6:42] Amen. He's worthy of everything.
[6:48] He deserves the glory and the honor,
[6:50] right? Praise God. Amen. We just have a
[6:54] couple of prayer requests here tonight,
[6:55] but I know we all have needs. So, let's
[6:57] listen to these and then just think
[6:59] about what you need God to do for you
[7:01] tonight. Sister Stephanie says, "Please
[7:03] continue to pray for my friend Heather
[7:06] Crans. She is back in the hospital with
[7:08] edema around her heart." Please also
[7:11] pray for Gilbert Landy that he'll come
[7:13] back to the Lord. God bless you. Amen.
[7:16] Trust the Lord for that. Sister Gomez
[7:18] says, "Please pray for all of our
[7:20] unsaved loved ones." Say that as well. I
[7:22] got a lot of unsaved loved ones myself.
[7:24] How many say Lord, help me be a light, a
[7:27] conduit, a channel that you can use to
[7:29] speak to one of them. Lord Jesus, that's
[7:31] our desire. Let's just if you have a
[7:34] Excuse me. I have a need tonight. Uh
[7:37] still dealing with a little bit of upper
[7:39] respiratory stuff, but I want to give
[7:40] God glory tonight. So, Amen. You guys
[7:43] sing so good. You guys were singing so
[7:44] good on Sunday. Brother Paul up here. I
[7:46] said we we could have just had a
[7:48] recording of somebody singing song. You
[7:49] guys would have still been on cloud
[7:50] nine. Praise the Lord. Just appreciate
[7:53] uh the worship. Amen. Everybody, praise
[7:56] the Lord. Let's just take our needs
[7:58] before him tonight and just trust him
[8:01] to speak to us through our pastor. Lord
[8:04] Jesus, we love you tonight. It's good to
[8:05] be in the house of God. Lord, um we want
[8:08] to praise you, Lord. There's so much
[8:10] that you've done for us, Lord. I'm I'm
[8:12] sure that in our life, Lord, uh we've
[8:15] disappointed you so many times, Lord,
[8:16] but I know, Lord Jesus, you've never
[8:19] disappointed us one time, Lord. Every
[8:20] time we call on your name, you're always
[8:22] there, Lord. We just trust you and
[8:24] believe. I pray that we'd be able to
[8:26] take you at your word tonight, Lord. If
[8:28] there'd be any anyone that's maybe uh
[8:30] committed a sin, Lord, something that
[8:31] may not be aware of or anything, Lord,
[8:33] we confess it to you, Lord. We we're in
[8:35] need of you, Lord. We don't depend on
[8:37] our own righteousness, Lord. We're
[8:39] depending on your righteousness, Lord
[8:41] Jesus, to save us, Lord. And that's what
[8:43] makes us want to praise you, Lord.
[8:45] That's why we love you so much because
[8:46] we could never do it on our own, Lord.
[8:48] Only you. Only you could save our souls.
[8:51] Only Jesus could satisfy my soul, as the
[8:53] song says. Lord, I pray that you bless
[8:56] the worshippers tonight, Lord, that's
[8:58] come out, Lord. The help me as a song
[9:01] leader with my voice, Lord, help the uh
[9:04] musicians to play skillfully, Lord. And
[9:06] we're looking forward to the word that
[9:07] the pastor will bring, Lord God, I know
[9:08] that he studies himself, applies
[9:10] himself. But Lord, I pray the same
[9:12] spirit that you put on him to reveal
[9:14] that word to him to make him write it
[9:15] down and put it together like it did.
[9:17] Lord, may it come down into our lives,
[9:19] Lord Jesus. We open up our lives as a as
[9:21] an open book to you, Lord, for you to uh
[9:24] we put ourselves on the the potter's
[9:25] wheel, Lord, for you to mold us into
[9:27] your image as you see fit tonight. We
[9:29] give you love and praise in Jesus
[9:31] Christ's
[9:32] name. Amen. Church says, "Amen."

[9:39] you. You may be

[33:45] seen
[33:47] as no man can
[33:50] know what God has in
[33:53] store. So, open up heaven.
[33:58] Open it
[34:00] wide over your church. Yes. And over our
[34:06] lives. Holy
[34:09] [Music]
[34:12] Spirit.
[34:14] Amen. Yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[34:18] [Music]
[34:20] Holy Spirit,

[34:27] down.
[34:30] Rain
[34:33] down. Oh my
[34:36] comforter and
[34:39] friend. How we need your touch again.
[34:46] Holy Spirit
[34:50] rain
[34:53] down his
[34:55] [Music]
[34:57] rain
[34:59] down. Let your power fall. Let your
[35:04] voice be heard. Come and change our
[35:09] hearts as we stand on your word, Holy
[35:14] Spirit.
[35:18] [Music]
[35:20] rain down.
[35:28] Yes,
[35:29] Lord. Rain
[35:34] down. Hallelujah.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:41] Hallelujah. Oh
[35:43] my. Hallelujah. Indeed, he's worthy,
[35:46] isn't he? Amen.
[35:50] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just go to
[35:53] him in a word of prayer before we turn
[35:55] to the
[35:56] [Music]
[35:58] scriptures. Lord
[36:00] [Music]
[36:02] Jesus, we so thank you Lord once again
[36:06] for your mercy and grace.
[36:09] Thank you for the privilege that we have
[36:11] to Lord be able to come and assemble
[36:14] together. Thank you father for the
[36:17] ability to be able to be here
[36:19] tonight. Lord we just your presence is
[36:23] here
[36:24] Lord. Oh God is your children Lord just
[36:28] coming and and you coming according to
[36:30] your word for you. You dwell in the
[36:33] praises of your people Lord. Father,
[36:36] beyond all of the toils of life, beyond
[36:38] all of our feelings, beyond everything,
[36:42] Lord, from the weak and the day,
[36:46] we've come here, Lord, to worship you.
[36:49] For Lord, you are worthy, Father.
[36:53] So, Lord, we ask God for your strength
[36:55] even in this moment that you would give
[36:58] us grace to move beyond, Lord, the
[37:00] weariness and tiredness of the day. God,
[37:04] may you anoint us with your spirit,
[37:05] Father.
[37:07] Grant it, Lord, carry us, Lord, from
[37:09] just this physical address, Lord, into
[37:12] the realities of heavenly places
[37:14] tonight. We pray. Lord, may you minister
[37:17] to every each and every heart, each and
[37:20] every need, Lord. We commit ourselves
[37:22] into your hands, Lord. And we want to
[37:25] say we love you, Father. May you
[37:27] minister to every need now, Lord. The
[37:29] unspoken request that's among us,
[37:31] Father.
[37:33] Grant it Lord we pray in Jesus name.
[37:37] Amen.
[37:39] Amen. Let's let's go in the scriptures
[37:42] here to 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[37:48] And I also want to remind those of you
[37:51] that haven't uh picked up the books that
[37:54] were ordered.
[37:56] Um my wife, she'll be back there in
[38:00] the the office that's right next to mine
[38:03] and uh quite a bit have already has
[38:06] already picked them up. There also is
[38:09] um extra books and things. So, if you
[38:12] want if you need a book, you didn't
[38:14] order a book or someone at some point in
[38:16] time, just um uh let her know so we can
[38:18] at least get it written down so we can
[38:20] get those because I I don't even have
[38:22] those out right now of the extras uh
[38:25] that we ordered and just tried to have a
[38:26] few extra on hand
[38:28] and especially now since those books
[38:31] come from
[38:35] China, but I think they would be worth a
[38:37] high
[38:39] tariff. But it's true.
[38:41] And so, you know, I got to thinking
[38:43] about that today. I thought, my, you
[38:44] know, and um so um they're there. And
[38:48] also the tracks, the tracks are setting
[38:51] out there on that um little place that
[38:55] sometimes you write out um requests over
[38:58] here in Spanish and in English. And so,
[39:02] um, we're going to try to get and put
[39:04] some labels on the back of those for
[39:07] this church here because it has
[39:08] Believers International on the back,
[39:10] which I really don't, it's fine with me,
[39:12] but if you're passing them out local,
[39:14] uh, so someone can at least get in
[39:16] contact and I'll try to put the email
[39:18] address that I have just kind of
[39:19] designated for church related matters.
[39:21] And that way, um, we have something to
[39:24] to go with on that. So, we'll work on
[39:26] that. But, um, it's just good to be
[39:28] here, is it? It's good to be together.
[39:30] Hallelujah. Amen. Just a wonderful time
[39:33] there on Sunday and Amen. just a
[39:35] wonderful presence of the Lord and God
[39:37] is so good to us. Amen. 1 Corinthians 12
[39:41] and we'll begin with verse uh
[39:44] 7. But the manifestation of the spirit
[39:47] is given to every man to profit with
[39:51] all. For to one is given by the spirit
[39:55] of the word of wisdom, to another the
[39:58] word of knowledge by the same
[40:00] spirit, to another faith by the same
[40:04] spirit, to another the gifts of healing
[40:07] by the same spirit, to another the
[40:10] working of miracles. Then if we can just
[40:14] I'll skip to verse 11. But all these
[40:18] workketh that one and selfsame and the
[40:21] self-samed spirit dividing to every man
[40:25] severally as he will. Amen. May God
[40:28] bless you and bless the reading of the
[40:30] word. As you're being seated, I'd like
[40:32] to continue that tonight here on the
[40:34] other spiritual gifts. I'm going to try
[40:36] to uh finish up on the gifts of healing
[40:39] and then go right into the working of
[40:42] miracles. And I just want to kind of
[40:45] come across on some of the the high
[40:48] points within it within those. And so um
[40:51] as I said, if at any time that the notes
[40:54] on any part of this series, uh you want
[40:57] that or if you want slides and notes,
[40:59] just just you can mention it to me or
[41:01] maybe we can send it out by email. Um
[41:04] and then you can just uh take it from
[41:06] there because I have a whole lot more
[41:08] notes than what I present on my slides.
[41:11] Um so with just looking at these things
[41:14] and just trying to comb it through the
[41:16] message and we know in looking at this
[41:18] uh brother Benham would you know
[41:20] standing in the time that when the
[41:22] message is striking uh the earth and
[41:25] this message that we're under is the
[41:27] promised uh message of restoration and
[41:31] so it is indeed the end time message and
[41:33] um you know uh many
[41:36] uh looked at that of what took place in
[41:38] Isuza Street and it was a great
[41:41] It was the restoration of the gifts, the
[41:44] baptism of the Holy Spirit. But that was
[41:47] only it was a closer it was a closer way
[41:50] than what sanctification was like we
[41:52] looked at on Sunday. But it was still
[41:55] when we understand it, it was still the
[41:57] shuck. And so within that of being the
[42:00] shuck, the final stage, there's four
[42:02] stages to life. And that fourth stage
[42:05] would be where the word himself comes
[42:08] into our midst. And that's where that
[42:11] where the message of the hour then
[42:13] coming in in this in this time um you
[42:17] know uh it it didn't didn't do away with
[42:20] anything because it was the life that
[42:22] was traveling all the way up. As a
[42:24] matter of fact, you read in history and
[42:26] Luther himself had uh the gifts of the
[42:30] spirit and he himself spoke in tongues
[42:32] and and so forth. So the gifts of the
[42:35] spirit were were were always there
[42:37] throughout uh within Luther and Wesley
[42:41] and uh you know and and and so forth.
[42:44] But God had a had a prescribed time that
[42:46] when that would be restored of the
[42:48] supernatural back to the church. But my
[42:51] my point is is that with that of the
[42:53] gifts, the gifts were not the goal or
[42:56] the or the finality or the we had
[42:58] arrived but they came and then you know
[43:01] brother Brandham says many different
[43:03] places of how that you know in the time
[43:06] uh the ways that they have been used or
[43:08] let go and he says it's caused a lot of
[43:11] confusion and the desire was that he
[43:14] said you know in some places he said I'd
[43:15] love to have a tent and just set this up
[43:18] and really do some apostolic teaching.
[43:20] and within that and we understand that
[43:22] you know there's an there's an element
[43:24] that when the Holy Spirit he comes among
[43:26] us there's things that the spirit of God
[43:28] will teach us in a way as far as that
[43:31] something to me I've always been
[43:33] amazement in some instances where
[43:35] persons didn't have to be taught certain
[43:37] things and yet when it lays in the word
[43:40] it lays there so that it might be taught
[43:43] so there's times for things to actually
[43:45] be taught and God wants us to be posted
[43:48] it's just like when what laid here in
[43:50] the scriptures with uh tongues
[43:53] interpretation and those things uh many
[43:55] of those with the gifts those were
[43:57] covered quite a bit even when brother
[43:59] Brandham was asked many of the questions
[44:01] within church order questions and
[44:03] answers God being misunderstood and even
[44:05] in questions and answers in ' 64 and
[44:08] other places of questions and answers
[44:09] really centered around those those two
[44:13] uh gifts um but yet we know that there's
[44:16] a need for teaching because teaching
[44:18] itself It really sets the the direction
[44:21] and as brother Bram says when they
[44:23] received these gifts he said the people
[44:26] just made havoc of it. He said
[44:27] especially the Pentecostal people until
[44:30] it had without teachings with just
[44:32] merely the spirit they brought down all
[44:35] kinds of modern fantastics and and they
[44:38] brought disgrace and shame on the word
[44:40] of God because that stuff isn't in the
[44:42] word. Now, Brother Bram goes into how
[44:44] all of those things continue to branch
[44:46] out. And and what he's speaking of here
[44:48] is how that with things being not
[44:51] brought under the subjection of the word
[44:53] and the teaching of the word, then it
[44:55] just leads to confusion. It leads to
[44:58] reproach and it gets to a place to where
[45:00] that you can really understand when Paul
[45:02] would write to the Thessalonans and say
[45:04] despite don't despise prophesying. Well,
[45:07] if he's telling them don't despise it,
[45:09] then evidently there's been something
[45:11] that has been done or dis or shown that
[45:14] could cause people to draw back and say,
[45:16] I don't want nothing to do with that at
[45:17] all. And so, Brother Bram even tells us,
[45:20] I think I read you a quote about a month
[45:21] ago or so on a Sunday service where
[45:24] brother Ram says, "It seems like
[45:25] sometimes from all of the impersonations
[45:28] and things that's been done and the
[45:29] misuse of gifts, he said it's actually
[45:31] caused a complex within people and to
[45:33] where that people say, well, I I don't
[45:35] want none of that." And then we also
[45:37] have this to where that you know uh that
[45:40] some can look at these statements within
[45:42] the word in the message of the hour in
[45:45] like what I was making here earlier that
[45:47] the gifts were not the goal and they'll
[45:49] take statements in that way and as
[45:51] though that the gifts uh they're no
[45:53] longer needed. But if God put them in
[45:55] the body, they're here. Amen. And he's
[45:58] not going to take them out. They're
[46:00] needed the whole way through. That's
[46:02] that's one of the things you know that
[46:03] when we uh God uses it as as it is
[46:06] needed. The message of the hour didn't
[46:08] do away with it. It only put it in its
[46:10] position. And then with that what the
[46:12] message of the hour did, it brings such
[46:15] a relationship between us and God to
[46:17] where that bringing our place our faith
[46:19] to where it's resting on the word of
[46:22] God. It's it's not our our faith is not
[46:24] in if I do this or if I do that or if I
[46:27] feel this or feel that or if so and so
[46:29] prays for me. And look, I believe we
[46:31] ought to have confidence. There's
[46:32] sometimes that you know what that we
[46:34] might need someone and you might have
[46:37] someone. There's a confidence for them
[46:38] to pray for you. And I believe that
[46:40] that's exactly right. According to the
[46:42] word of God, sometimes we go through
[46:44] things, but I believe that within it all
[46:46] that the message of the hour, it brings
[46:48] us to a place of a real faith in the
[46:50] word of God. And so within that when we
[46:54] look here at the the gifts I'm just
[46:56] going to jump right back into this on
[46:58] the gifts of healing and and so with it
[47:02] on the gifts of healing noticing brother
[47:05] Bram says you know what the gift of
[47:07] healing is. It's faith in healing. You
[47:12] just release your faith to pray for
[47:15] somebody. That's all a gift of healing
[47:18] is every minister should have it.
[47:21] Everybody see should have gift of
[47:23] healing. Now watch the power that heals
[47:26] you. Now he's talking to the individual
[47:28] who's being prayed for. The power that
[47:30] heals you is on the inside of you. The
[47:33] Holy Spirit, you just have to let it
[47:36] work its way out. Because remember what
[47:40] is the Holy Spirit? It's the faith of
[47:42] God. Is that right? And so now the
[47:45] prophet goes on and he says you know
[47:46] with within looking at this uh you know
[47:49] he says a gift of healing doesn't mean
[47:52] that he gives you power to heal someone.
[47:56] It means that he gives you faith for
[47:58] their healing and to get it.
[48:02] So God gives you faith for their
[48:05] healing.
[48:07] Now watch this next part. It has to work
[48:09] together. A person that's being prayed
[48:12] for has to also have that faith or it
[48:16] would never work. The individual, it's
[48:19] your own personal faith in a finished
[48:22] work. I think one of the things we can
[48:24] see and I gave the the testimony at
[48:26] times I I think I gave it with
[48:28] concerning to brother Gabriel and his
[48:30] praying for him and then uh times when I
[48:32] prayed for others. You you just you just
[48:34] are wanting to see I want to see where
[48:37] where individuals are at. And and I'm
[48:38] not talking about whether they're a
[48:40] believer or not. That's one thing. But
[48:42] even for sometimes as a believer, we can
[48:44] get, you know, just we just need a
[48:46] little encouragement. And you begin to
[48:48] talk about the Lord and begin to talk
[48:50] about his faithfulness and and you begin
[48:52] to speak about him, he draws near. And
[48:55] that that in itself begins to, you know,
[48:58] speaking about his word just begins to
[48:59] build faith. And and then what's it
[49:02] doing? It's building the faith for that
[49:04] of that individual. And if God's put
[49:05] that burden on your heart, maybe he
[49:08] hasn't, and you're just there
[49:09] fellowshipping and all of a sudden it
[49:11] drops in that moment. See, it's a
[49:13] sovereign thing. Sometimes it is, as
[49:15] brother Bram is speaking here, that here
[49:17] God has given that it's dropped in your
[49:19] heart to pray for that individual or to
[49:21] get with that individual. But you know,
[49:23] it'll always it'll have to be faith on
[49:26] both ends. So this is why that gifts of
[49:29] healing, it's faith working on both
[49:32] ends. And that's why when brother Brand
[49:34] would say this over and over that a gift
[49:35] of healing isn't something that's in
[49:38] somebody to heal somebody else. The
[49:41] person being prayed for has to also have
[49:45] faith themselves.
[49:47] Now he says it's the prayer your prayer.
[49:50] Your prayer. Now remember if you're
[49:52] going to be healed don't think that
[49:54] somebody that's got a gift of divine
[49:57] healing heals you. If you're going to be
[49:59] healed by divine healing, you are the
[50:02] one that's got the gift of healing. It's
[50:05] your faith in Christ, not this person,
[50:08] no other man. It's your own individual
[50:11] faith in Christ. And he says, "How many
[50:13] understands that?" So, it comes back to
[50:15] even what we were working with even in
[50:18] the first part of uh to another faith
[50:20] when it's speaking of even that of the g
[50:22] a gift of faith. It's dealing with faith
[50:25] for deliverance, faith for healing. And
[50:28] that's what a gift of healing is. It's
[50:30] faith in healing. And so when it's when
[50:33] you see really within these we're going
[50:35] to cover here tonight, it's it's faith
[50:37] working uh even in a gift of healing.
[50:40] It's faith working in the working of
[50:42] miracles all the way through. And so
[50:45] here I it's it's your faith. It's the
[50:48] faith of the individual that is praying
[50:50] and it's the faith of the individual
[50:51] that's being prayed for. Brother Bram
[50:53] says, "I could do nothing. I could pray
[50:55] for you or your neighbor can pray for
[50:58] you. But it's your faith that does the
[51:00] healing. You accept yourself
[51:03] individually what Christ has done for
[51:05] you. You lay hold on it and it's the
[51:08] truth. Now, I I think to me when we're
[51:11] looking at this, it's not just
[51:12] understanding the gifts of healing, but
[51:15] it should also in a place of how that
[51:17] God would work to so uh build our faith
[51:21] and how that when we approach the
[51:23] promises of God, I you know, over and
[51:26] over, Brother Brandham would lay this
[51:27] out so clearly in the message and he
[51:29] wasn't trying, you know, to be repulsive
[51:32] with things, just truthful because Satan
[51:35] will work upon people sometimes, you
[51:37] know, they come and maybe they just come
[51:39] and it's just, you know, they're just
[51:41] kind of haphazard and they really don't
[51:43] know and well, I don't know, maybe I'll
[51:44] get the Holy Ghost. I don't know, maybe
[51:46] God will heal me. And that's why brother
[51:48] Bram says just sit in your seat. He
[51:49] said, cuz it ain't going to do you no
[51:51] good. You see this atmosphere up here
[51:53] and and coming in that way that that's
[51:55] not going to change. You have to
[51:57] understand that when we approach God,
[51:59] the foundation is he that cometh to God
[52:03] must believe that he is and he is a
[52:07] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[52:10] him. Amen. Because then it's that faith
[52:13] on the inside that then is connected and
[52:17] the promise of God is being brought down
[52:19] not just for the moment but for you to
[52:21] hold on to your healing. All right.
[52:23] Amen. Now with this here remember that
[52:26] how God you know with this and working
[52:29] in such an individual way. You remember
[52:31] the situation brother Brandham talked
[52:32] about with brother Krauss and brother
[52:34] Krauss was a man that he had a he had
[52:37] contact with brother Brandham had
[52:38] contact with oral Roberts and brother
[52:39] Brandham will tell this in many of the
[52:42] uh messages on divine love and uh any of
[52:45] those messages that you would listen to
[52:46] most of the time he'll tell this story
[52:48] and he talks about how that brother
[52:50] Krauss had developed a kidney condition
[52:52] and when he developed that kidney
[52:54] condition he just said well you know
[52:56] I'll just go have dinner with or Roberts
[52:57] he'll pray for me and it'll be gone and
[52:59] so Brother Brham said, "Brother Krauss
[53:01] went with brother Oral Roberts. They had
[53:02] a nice steak dinner." He said, "Oro oral
[53:04] Roberts prayed for him." He sat and it
[53:06] lifted. He said, "But in two days it was
[53:08] back, right?" And so he said then, you
[53:11] know, he said, "Well, I'll just call
[53:13] brother Brandham up." So he called
[53:14] Brother Brandham, had dinner with
[53:15] brother Brandham. Brother Brandham, you
[53:17] know, is looking and and he says, "Well,
[53:19] I don't see anything that would be
[53:20] hindering the healing." So you see, even
[53:22] in that matter, it wasn't unconfessed
[53:24] sin that allowed it to come back. Right?
[53:27] This is why we need all this. why we
[53:29] don't want to don't get in a hasty hurry
[53:31] to all of a sudden judge something.
[53:33] Brother Bram tells us over and over,
[53:35] especially when he's dealing with these
[53:36] things, he said, "Many times we're prone
[53:38] as human beings to misjudge things."
[53:42] And so just let it just let it let it
[53:44] manifest itself. And so here with this,
[53:46] you know, uh with brother Krauss had
[53:48] come back from Brother Oral Roberts and
[53:50] Brother Bram's praying for him and he
[53:51] says, "I don't I don't see anything
[53:53] that's wrong, you know, anything in your
[53:54] life." And and so he's praying for him
[53:56] and nothing transpires. And brother
[53:58] Krauss comes in to he has to now going
[54:00] to have the surgery. And the thing about
[54:02] the surgery was there was a 1 in 10,000
[54:05] chance that he wouldn't make it through
[54:07] that surgery.
[54:09] And so brother Krauss laid there on the
[54:11] table and and all of a sudden he says as
[54:14] he was laying there before the surgery
[54:16] he just begin to think upon the Lord and
[54:18] he be to say Lord how I love you. How I
[54:20] just appreciate you Lord. How good
[54:22] you've been. How faithful you've been.
[54:24] And he says the next thing he know he
[54:26] wakes up from the surgery and the
[54:28] doctors the surgeon said there was such
[54:30] an atmosphere such a presence in that
[54:33] room. I want you to notice brother Brown
[54:36] tells us in that message on love he says
[54:38] what it was he says is brother Krauss
[54:40] you know it just it kind of got his
[54:42] confidence in in certain in certain
[54:44] places and and God allowed that to come
[54:46] back into a place to where the only
[54:49] object of love and adoration is the Lord
[54:52] Jesus Christ. Right. So, it's such a
[54:54] balance in having confidence. And I
[54:56] believe that God God has placed these
[54:59] gifts within the body. But we never we
[55:03] never never ever want to make our life
[55:06] to where that we can only uh have
[55:09] healing or only live victorious. If
[55:12] either so and so's preaching or so and
[55:14] so is praying for me or so and so does
[55:16] this that then what happens is you you
[55:18] are paralyzing that part of the body
[55:21] which you are a part of. God is God no
[55:24] matter where he's at. And you know, God
[55:26] doesn't have it doesn't have to be
[55:28] Thursday night at 7 for God to heal you.
[55:30] God, when you have a need that arises in
[55:32] your body, you can call God on the scene
[55:35] and God can minister to your need right
[55:37] there. So, we don't want to confine God
[55:39] through a box. If anything, we want to
[55:42] actually understand his miracles. That's
[55:46] what Israel didn't do. Israel didn't
[55:50] understand his miracles. And so every
[55:52] time a situation came about, Israel was
[55:55] out there saying,"Great, now here we
[55:57] are. What's going on? I mean, why's
[55:58] this?" And you know, they're just like,
[55:59] "Come on, come on. I mean, where where's
[56:01] this at? I want quails. I They became
[56:03] more impatient." And it and and that's
[56:06] why David said they understood not all
[56:10] his miracles. The reason God moves in
[56:14] that way he would move through an
[56:16] individual is not so that we become
[56:18] reliant on that person but it's really
[56:21] if we can understand it it's God letting
[56:24] us know his love and his care for us
[56:29] and he's right there with us
[56:33] now you know it's just like many other
[56:37] examples but I just want to move on here
[56:39] tonight but you know You had a situation
[56:42] even you know when looking at how that
[56:44] the word itself when the word is being
[56:47] preached. Brother Bram as I gave you a
[56:49] few examples last week with different
[56:51] ones and brother Bram said one of the
[56:53] gifts ways the ways that the gift of
[56:56] healing it can be administers he said
[56:58] you can take a good Bible expositor a
[57:01] master teacher he said of the word he
[57:03] said and they can so lay that word out
[57:05] there that it can make cause you to see
[57:09] the finished work. Now I'll tell you
[57:11] there's it's not the man remember it's a
[57:15] gift of healing that's working it's not
[57:17] the man it's not his ability to explain
[57:19] it it's coming into that channel and God
[57:22] is operating within that way now you and
[57:25] I can we are we the ones to determine
[57:28] that's the way that this particular way
[57:30] it's going to come no works in such a
[57:34] multi-faceted way to do what why does he
[57:37] always do it within this way so that our
[57:40] faith will rest solemnly in him. So, in
[57:44] other words, you're not saying, "Come
[57:45] on, brother Samuel. Hurry up. Hurry up.
[57:47] Hurry up. Come on, man. Hurry up. Hurry
[57:48] up. I I I want to be prayed for at the
[57:50] end of service." You can miss what God
[57:53] wants to do right now. Hey, the prophet
[57:57] of God said, "There's many ways. God can
[57:59] heal by medicine. God can heal by love.
[58:02] God can heal by music. It just depends
[58:05] on what kind of healing you have need
[58:08] of. So I believe that we are witnesses
[58:11] of that how God can come and minister.
[58:14] We don't want to confine God to any way.
[58:16] We just want to say Lord you know my
[58:18] need and God might indeed take that and
[58:20] most times if you have that where it's
[58:23] building faith is being built and and I
[58:26] like I've said this before sometimes you
[58:27] can see this in a real uniqueness of
[58:30] service and you know sometimes where a
[58:33] brother will get into a such a vein and
[58:35] man it is it is backing the devil up in
[58:38] a corner it no is not even no is almost
[58:43] like wiped out of the dictionary. Amen.
[58:46] You understand? You've no doubt got some
[58:48] in your mind right now how how God will
[58:50] do that. That's that's special. That's
[58:52] needed. God doesn't want and and I know
[58:54] brother Codri wouldn't mind me saying
[58:56] this. God's not interested in brother
[58:58] Codry that he's got to be a deep teacher
[59:00] or brother Daryl. They're evangelists
[59:04] and God uses that gift in that strain.
[59:06] Now, can God do that even through a
[59:09] teacher? Sure he can. Can he do it right
[59:11] through a pastor? Sure he can. Hey, let
[59:14] me tell you, God can do it right through
[59:15] you.
[59:18] So, we don't limit God or confined in a
[59:20] box. Has to be somebody else. What about
[59:22] your hands? Your hands have been
[59:24] sanctified. Your life has been cleaned
[59:27] up. Amen. You're not your own. You've
[59:29] been bought with a price.
[59:32] These nine gifts, spiritual gifts.
[59:34] Brother Ram said like this. He said,
[59:35] "It's like this tent." Or, "Can I use
[59:37] this building tonight?" And we're
[59:39] gathered inside of this building. He
[59:41] said they're here already.
[59:45] Those gifts are here already. They're
[59:47] not coming in. They're here. And that's
[59:49] why the prophet said, this is why he
[59:51] says, you want to be a prayed up
[59:53] congregation.
[59:56] You want to be praying, you know, and
[59:58] brother man, when he's talking about
[59:59] praying for those things. I have one
[1:00:01] particular quote. He's not talking about
[1:00:03] seeking after them, but he's talking
[1:00:05] about praying. In other words, just
[1:00:07] being in a manner of prayer because we
[1:00:09] have no idea the needs at times that
[1:00:11] come here among us or how God might use
[1:00:14] you in another capacity that's outside
[1:00:17] of these walls, but you're a part of the
[1:00:19] body.
[1:00:21] So, we want to be available. We want to
[1:00:23] be we want to be, if I can say like
[1:00:25] this, spiritual. And spiritual does not
[1:00:28] mean that I'm walking in the clouds.
[1:00:29] Spiritual means that I'm walking in step
[1:00:32] with him. My life is clear. My life is
[1:00:34] clean. And I'm just loving the Lord.
[1:00:36] He's the joy of my life. And I'm just
[1:00:38] available.
[1:00:40] I mean, the fork that's in the drawer
[1:00:42] that's clean, it's not no special fork.
[1:00:44] It's just available. If I need it, I go
[1:00:46] get it. Or the spoon. And that's how God
[1:00:49] requires us to live our life. That's a
[1:00:51] real spiritual life. A real spiritual
[1:00:52] life
[1:00:54] isn't that's odd. You're making you are
[1:00:57] making yourself odd.
[1:01:00] That's right. And that causes others to
[1:01:02] lose confidence. We don't have to do
[1:01:05] that. We have nothing to prove to
[1:01:06] anybody else. We just want to be part of
[1:01:08] the other forks in the drawer.
[1:01:11] Is that right? Hallelujah. Maybe God
[1:01:14] wants to use a short fork or long fork.
[1:01:16] Whatever it is,
[1:01:19] whatever it is, Lord. So we understand
[1:01:23] that with this notice how the disciples
[1:01:26] they this was after the man at the gate
[1:01:28] called beautiful was you know was uh was
[1:01:30] healed and and Peter and John and them
[1:01:33] you know man they were beaten and and so
[1:01:35] forth and and here they are sent back to
[1:01:37] the company that had been praying on
[1:01:39] them praying for them and this was the
[1:01:41] prayer among the church Lord behold
[1:01:43] their threatenings remember they told
[1:01:45] them don't you be don't you be don't you
[1:01:47] be teaching in this name no more and we
[1:01:49] just just seal it up just shut it up.
[1:01:52] But you know what happened? The reason
[1:01:54] this happened, Brother Brmond says the
[1:01:57] devil on the day of Pentecost, he didn't
[1:01:59] even get out of bed when the Holy Ghost
[1:02:01] was poured out.
[1:02:04] He said, "But when that man at the gate
[1:02:06] called beautiful was healed," he said
[1:02:09] that got the devil mad.
[1:02:12] You know why? Because the life that was
[1:02:15] in the body was traveling through the
[1:02:18] body. Amen. And it was God giving
[1:02:22] witness through their lives. And that's
[1:02:24] why brother Brand said, "You let divine
[1:02:26] healing strike." And he said, "Every
[1:02:28] rogue hound out of hell, we'll take
[1:02:30] right after it and try to disprove it
[1:02:32] and try to talk it down." You see, this
[1:02:34] is why that that Satan, no wonder he
[1:02:37] wants to try to take things from the
[1:02:39] church of what belongs to us. Let me
[1:02:41] just tell you something. What God has
[1:02:43] given to us, it belongs to us. And we
[1:02:46] God will use it as it's needed.
[1:02:51] I'm not going to tell you the person's
[1:02:52] name, but you know, it's like a person,
[1:02:54] they had a lot of stock pots and all of
[1:02:57] a sudden when Instapot came out, they
[1:02:59] got rid of all their stockps and all
[1:03:00] they had was an Instapot. They thought
[1:03:03] this was going to do the need for
[1:03:05] everything cuz it can act like a stockp.
[1:03:07] The problem was is that when we had a
[1:03:09] fellowship dinner, they realized an
[1:03:11] Instapot's not going to do. a stockp is
[1:03:13] the or you know a crockpot is the one
[1:03:15] that'll warm things up and it'll keep it
[1:03:17] warm and sustained. And so then their
[1:03:20] precious husband had to go out and buy a
[1:03:23] crockpot. I don't know. I don't know.
[1:03:25] I'm not here to discern whether that was
[1:03:26] a ploy just to get a new crockpot or
[1:03:28] not. But anyhow, don't mean to cause no
[1:03:31] trouble, but you know, you understand
[1:03:32] what I'm saying that when God has put
[1:03:34] something, it's not for you and I to
[1:03:36] disqualify it. The message of the hour
[1:03:40] never took away any scripture.
[1:03:45] Never. It didn't do away with
[1:03:47] justification. It brought that
[1:03:48] revelation on a higher level
[1:03:53] that you were you were justified in that
[1:03:55] you you never did it in the first place.
[1:03:58] It took you back to the mind of God.
[1:04:02] It never did away with it. They simply
[1:04:05] put it in place and in order that the
[1:04:08] church of the living God could rest.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah. Now, this is why it goes on.
[1:04:15] I want you to notice it says, "By
[1:04:17] stretching forth thine hand to heal, and
[1:04:19] that signs and wonders may be done by
[1:04:23] the name of thy holy child, Jesus." Look
[1:04:25] at the request. the stretching forth of
[1:04:28] thy hand, Lord, that the signs and
[1:04:30] wonders may be done by the hand of thy
[1:04:33] holy child, Jesus. Well, he's got no
[1:04:35] other hands but our hands. And the Bible
[1:04:37] said, "By the hands of the apostles were
[1:04:41] many signs and wonders wrought among the
[1:04:43] people, and they were all in one accord
[1:04:46] in Solomon's porch, and the rest there
[1:04:48] no man join himself to them." But the
[1:04:50] people magnified them, and the believers
[1:04:53] were more added to the Lord multitudes,
[1:04:56] both of men and women, in so much that
[1:05:01] they brought forth the sick into the
[1:05:04] streets, and laid them on beds and
[1:05:06] couches, that at the least the shadow of
[1:05:10] Peter passing by might overshadow them,
[1:05:13] or some of them. And there also came out
[1:05:16] multitude of the cities round about unto
[1:05:18] Jerusalem, bringing sick folks and them
[1:05:21] which were vexed with unclean spirits,
[1:05:24] and they were healed, everyone.
[1:05:28] Now, I want you to think about this. It
[1:05:31] was God operating through the hands of
[1:05:35] the apostles. And this very thing here
[1:05:37] where they laid them in the shadow, it
[1:05:40] was not the man that healed them. It was
[1:05:43] not Peter that healed them. But the P
[1:05:46] brother would tell us and he would take
[1:05:48] brother Ram would spend quite a few
[1:05:49] different times in services and speak to
[1:05:52] us in this way. He said you know after
[1:05:54] Jesus went away many of the beloved
[1:05:57] people of God were sick and afflicted.
[1:05:59] God gave Peter the gift of divine
[1:06:00] healing. And the people got healed
[1:06:03] because God testified through Peter of
[1:06:06] the gift of divine healing just like he
[1:06:09] testified through Elisha as a prophet,
[1:06:12] through Moses as a deliverer, through
[1:06:15] Christ as a son. And brother Ram will
[1:06:17] continue to pick this point up and he
[1:06:20] said what it was. He said God had sent
[1:06:23] Peter for a specific work to do. Now all
[1:06:27] of them, all of the apostles were
[1:06:29] involved here. But brother Brandham just
[1:06:31] you know he he shows such in this place
[1:06:33] where he's talking about Peter and you
[1:06:35] know Peter was a great man of faith but
[1:06:38] you recognize that even when you look at
[1:06:40] that of the body and and then this
[1:06:42] really could actually go into a
[1:06:43] different service but you know brother
[1:06:45] Brandon would talk about how that Peter
[1:06:47] with that gift of faith was actually
[1:06:50] that uh you know uh and that that was
[1:06:52] given for a specific work but when you
[1:06:55] look at John John 1 John 2 John third
[1:06:57] John John the very one remember who
[1:06:59] wanted to call down fire on out of
[1:07:01] heaven on the Samaritans. Remember that
[1:07:04] the very one who said, "Lord, shall we
[1:07:06] call down fire from heaven?" He became
[1:07:09] the the very vessel that love that God
[1:07:12] chose to manifest love through. You
[1:07:14] know, you might look and say, "Why can't
[1:07:16] I be like somebody else?" Maybe God
[1:07:18] hasn't called you to be like that. Maybe
[1:07:20] what God has called you to be is a
[1:07:22] channel that forgiveness can be
[1:07:24] displayed through. Love can be displayed
[1:07:27] through. That's exactly what brother
[1:07:29] Brandham is talking. I mean, what a I
[1:07:31] mean, what a miracle in itself. Here is
[1:07:33] the same man who was wanting to call
[1:07:35] fire down out of heaven. And now this is
[1:07:37] the same one who all that he could speak
[1:07:39] about is the love of God.
[1:07:43] Is that right?
[1:07:45] Oh my. Hey, it's no marvel. Look what he
[1:07:48] done in your life. Look what he done in
[1:07:49] our in each of our lives. Amen. My Lord,
[1:07:53] we were, you know, doubt some of us
[1:07:54] might have been so mean that a
[1:07:56] rattlesnake might have seemed harmless
[1:07:57] compared to us. But notice within this,
[1:08:01] I want you to notice this principle.
[1:08:02] Peter understood this. For when he said,
[1:08:05] "Ye men of Israel hear these words,
[1:08:08] Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God
[1:08:11] among you by miracles, wonders, and
[1:08:15] signs which God did by him in the midst
[1:08:21] of you as you yourselves also know." So
[1:08:25] the
[1:08:26] confirmation of the word was confirming
[1:08:31] with miracles, wonders and signs. And
[1:08:33] you know, God knows just what's needed,
[1:08:37] right? Amen. You know, you you and I
[1:08:40] could say, "Oh, oh, this is what needs
[1:08:42] to be done." No, just God knows. Listen,
[1:08:45] God knows how to get a hold of
[1:08:46] everybody.
[1:08:48] He knows. He's never lost sight of you
[1:08:50] or I. He knows how. And you know what?
[1:08:52] It's it's not us to pushing or trying to
[1:08:55] get somebody. But you know what? Just
[1:08:57] just being available and however God
[1:08:59] wants to do it. But I'll tell you, God
[1:09:01] always confirms his word. And listen,
[1:09:04] this message though, though the seventh
[1:09:06] angel left, but the mighty angel is
[1:09:08] still accompanying this message. He's
[1:09:10] the same one moving among us, healing
[1:09:13] those that are sick in their body,
[1:09:15] delivering the captive, filling with the
[1:09:17] Holy Ghost. He's the same angel of the
[1:09:19] Lord among us.
[1:09:21] Now, this is why when it comes down to
[1:09:23] it and you look at it that the brazen
[1:09:25] serpent, remember they were to raise
[1:09:26] that up and whoever look and live. It
[1:09:29] wasn't the brazen serpent had hands that
[1:09:31] came out and laid hands on them, but
[1:09:33] they looked and and they lived because
[1:09:36] they had confidence by seeing what God
[1:09:38] had done through that. It was not the
[1:09:40] water in the pool of Bethesda that
[1:09:43] healed them. It was their faith in an
[1:09:46] act of God of what? God coming down
[1:09:48] through him by the angel and stirring up
[1:09:50] the water. It was God. And that's why
[1:09:54] brother Brand was saying that even when
[1:09:56] Peter had received this gift of healing,
[1:09:58] he said the people laid in his shadow
[1:10:01] and was healed, it was not the man, but
[1:10:04] their faith in God that was in the man.
[1:10:07] All right. It was the same way with Paul
[1:10:10] with the laying on of handkerchiefs and
[1:10:12] and so forth. It was the spirit of God
[1:10:15] in the man that done the healing through
[1:10:18] the faith of the people. This is why
[1:10:21] it's gifts, right, of healing, right?
[1:10:25] Gifts because it it's so diverse of how
[1:10:30] that God would actually do this at times
[1:10:33] in the ways that it would it would
[1:10:34] actually come about. Let me just read
[1:10:36] this to you. Brother Bram says there's
[1:10:38] no such thing as the gift of healing
[1:10:41] because it's in the plural. It's gifts.
[1:10:44] God works in many different ways to heal
[1:10:47] the sick. Sometimes preaching the word,
[1:10:50] sometimes a neighbor sitting by you,
[1:10:52] you'll just lay your hand over on you
[1:10:55] and you feel feel like he should do so.
[1:10:57] Always do that. Whatever a bornagain
[1:11:01] child of God feels to pray for the sick,
[1:11:04] that's the Holy Ghost moving in you to
[1:11:06] do so. No matter who's going to pray for
[1:11:09] the person, you go ahead and pray for
[1:11:11] him anyhow. Amen.
[1:11:13] Well, I I know Brother Daryl's here
[1:11:15] tonight. If you feel to pray for him,
[1:11:17] right?
[1:11:19] Amen. Brother Bam's been relating this
[1:11:22] because of multiple events in his
[1:11:24] ministry. Sure.
[1:11:27] Oh my. So when we come to that, this is
[1:11:30] just another, you know, a little bit of
[1:11:32] an angle on gifts of healing that
[1:11:34] actually the prayer of faith is that
[1:11:37] that's what gifts of healing is. It's
[1:11:39] the prayer of faith. Notice the
[1:11:41] scripture very familiar. If any sick
[1:11:43] among you, let them call for the elders
[1:11:45] of the church. Wow. It I I thought maybe
[1:11:49] I maybe better read this again. Maybe
[1:11:51] this isn't the New 2025 version. The New
[1:11:54] 2025 version said, "Is any sick among
[1:11:57] you? Wait for somebody to contact you
[1:12:00] and then if they don't blast them on
[1:12:02] Instagram, tell them how uncaring they
[1:12:04] are on Facebook. No,
[1:12:06] that's that's the lady version of the
[1:12:09] new home. This is the order. See,
[1:12:12] sometimes the simple simple things
[1:12:16] and we wonder, God, where are you at?
[1:12:19] That's right. You got to follow his
[1:12:20] word. That's the truth. Is that right?
[1:12:23] Right. The Bible said, "Let him call for
[1:12:26] the elders of the church, and let them
[1:12:28] pray over him, anointing him with oil in
[1:12:32] the name of the Lord, and the prayer of
[1:12:34] faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
[1:12:37] shall raise him up." So the prayer of
[1:12:40] faith, that inspiration given by God,
[1:12:43] and it's God who does the raising up. If
[1:12:45] they've committed any sins, they shall
[1:12:48] be forgiven them. So, Brother Brham says
[1:12:50] God puts some in the church to be gifts
[1:12:51] of healing. That's prayer of faith,
[1:12:54] right? He says, now, Brother Brham goes
[1:12:57] into this, and you you've heard this
[1:12:58] many many times of how that brother
[1:13:01] Brandon would talk about how in ways
[1:13:03] that with this uh uh of of working with
[1:13:06] people. You you have to be sensitive and
[1:13:08] be able to enter in. I I tell you, I
[1:13:11] really think we're living in an age and
[1:13:14] of a time we got to understand that
[1:13:16] there's nothing new under the sun, but
[1:13:18] we're in a we're in a battle.
[1:13:21] And Satan works to battle to where it's
[1:13:23] like sometimes you get in and you're
[1:13:26] just almost like I'm glad I made it
[1:13:27] across the threshold of the door or when
[1:13:30] where things are compounded and it's
[1:13:32] just it's an age of like a wearing out.
[1:13:35] That's exactly what was coming or came
[1:13:37] down in Egypt right before the Exodus.
[1:13:40] They told them make brick without
[1:13:42] straws. When when the Exodus started to
[1:13:44] be announced in their heart, things
[1:13:46] started to move in their life. That's
[1:13:48] where Satan said, "Let me just let me
[1:13:50] wear him. Let me just let me just
[1:13:53] overwork him. Let me just get let me
[1:13:55] just get into in into that place." Why?
[1:13:58] His objective is is to where that we uh
[1:14:01] don't we we're no longer available or
[1:14:04] useful. Now, I'll just say it like this.
[1:14:06] God knew we were going to be here in
[1:14:07] this time. That's right. I do not
[1:14:09] believe that God and I just say this. I
[1:14:11] say it very frank to you. God's not
[1:14:13] called you to do what God's called me to
[1:14:15] do. He's not called you to study or to
[1:14:18] listen to, you know, as many messages
[1:14:20] and going through all this. God's not
[1:14:21] called. Yes, you get into it, but God's
[1:14:24] not called you. So, don't don't don't
[1:14:25] put a requirement on your life that's
[1:14:27] not there, right? But to but to
[1:14:29] understand this part of it that God
[1:14:32] knows exactly where we're at. And you
[1:14:33] know what? Even sometimes when you're
[1:14:35] driving there to work, you're coming
[1:14:37] home, or even through the time, Lord,
[1:14:39] give me the strength. Give me wisdom. If
[1:14:41] there's something that I could be a
[1:14:42] little bit more wise in this area, you
[1:14:44] know what you're doing? You're trying to
[1:14:45] redeem back time.
[1:14:47] So don't just we don't want to we
[1:14:50] realize we're not defeated. We're not
[1:14:52] helpless. I know sometimes we feel like
[1:14:54] you you start feeling helpless. Then you
[1:14:56] then you you you let that go and then
[1:14:58] you start feeling worthless.
[1:15:00] Because you know why? You were put here
[1:15:02] for a purpose. And your purpose, yes,
[1:15:05] there's a part of it in your natural
[1:15:06] life, but it is much deeper than that.
[1:15:09] You're here to display God. Amen. You're
[1:15:12] here to manifest God in your where your
[1:15:15] light shines.
[1:15:17] So with that, you know, I'm saying that
[1:15:20] with a sense because sometimes we can
[1:15:22] just become it's almost just like one
[1:15:24] day's ending if I could just make it to
[1:15:26] the next day. And we that's why brother
[1:15:28] Brandon would make the statement in
[1:15:30] fundamental foundation of faith. He
[1:15:31] said, "God, help the people to see that
[1:15:34] their purpose is not just to go to work,
[1:15:36] come home and read the newspaper, go to
[1:15:39] bed, and get back up the next day, and
[1:15:40] then go to church on Sunday." But God,
[1:15:43] help them to realize they're to be
[1:15:45] channels.
[1:15:46] They're put here to be branches. And so,
[1:15:50] you know, that's why I'm saying that,
[1:15:51] you know what? Don't don't don't try to
[1:15:52] figure it out. Just say, "Lord, here am
[1:15:54] I. I'm your branch, Lord. Lord, you know
[1:15:58] the capacity that you're choosing me. I
[1:16:00] don't have to try to imagine something
[1:16:01] in my mind. I'm just going to take the
[1:16:03] word that you're speaking to my heart
[1:16:04] and I'm going to say, "Be it unto me,
[1:16:06] Lord. Lead me, guide me, teach me, show
[1:16:09] me in the season of life that I'm in."
[1:16:11] Because how many know seasons of life
[1:16:13] change
[1:16:15] changes, right? Sometimes even your
[1:16:17] stamina and everything else, you know, I
[1:16:19] remember one of the times I I'd call my
[1:16:21] brother, you know, because when I first
[1:16:22] started pastoring, uh I may be off on a
[1:16:24] rabbit trail here, but let's just go
[1:16:26] with it. I remember, you know, I first
[1:16:27] started pastoring. My goodness, man. I
[1:16:29] was I was just, oh, man, just getting
[1:16:31] digging right in there. And here I was,
[1:16:33] you know, I was used to because I was
[1:16:34] preaching a lot on Thursdays. But then
[1:16:35] when I started pastoring, here I am
[1:16:37] going, you know, in both service of the
[1:16:39] week, man, I just, you know, after
[1:16:40] dinner, then I would go in the office,
[1:16:42] be there sometimes to 1:00 in the
[1:16:44] morning, turn around, get up at 5:30,
[1:16:45] get on the treadmill, run, and then go
[1:16:47] to work and man, come home, you know,
[1:16:49] man, I was just going and going and
[1:16:51] going and and then I hit sometime later,
[1:16:54] I think it was maybe in my
[1:16:56] mid30s, man.
[1:16:59] Man,
[1:17:01] man. Man, I I got I got the feeling like
[1:17:04] I was backslid because you know why? I
[1:17:07] couldn't keep the same schedule, right?
[1:17:09] I'd find myself on Mondays. Oh my
[1:17:12] goodness. And and Tuesdays, you know,
[1:17:14] mentally now then even the the the
[1:17:16] strength in my body. And I remember I
[1:17:18] called my brother and this was just a a
[1:17:20] wonderful conversation of wisdom. And I
[1:17:22] told him, you know, I just my heart was
[1:17:24] just kind of breaking, you know, because
[1:17:25] I I said, I want to give my all to the
[1:17:27] Lord. I don't want to. Look, God knows I
[1:17:29] want to give him my all and for his
[1:17:30] people. I want to do that. And my
[1:17:32] brother just he made a statement. He
[1:17:34] said, "Hey, Sam." Yeah. He said, "How
[1:17:37] old you say you
[1:17:43] was? I know that wasn't very spiritual,
[1:17:45] but it helped me. It was a season of
[1:17:48] life, and sometimes the enemy likes to
[1:17:50] beat us up, and it's just a change in a
[1:17:52] season of life." And let me just tell
[1:17:54] you something.
[1:17:56] I got to go with this.
[1:17:59] The same God in the spring is the same
[1:18:02] God in the summer.
[1:18:04] He's the same God in the fall and he's
[1:18:07] the same God in the winter.
[1:18:10] He's the same God in every season.
[1:18:13] Seasons might feel a little different,
[1:18:15] might look a little different. The light
[1:18:17] may not be as bright sometimes, but he's
[1:18:20] still God. No matter the change of
[1:18:23] season, he's still God.
[1:18:26] You love him. Amen. This is why brother
[1:18:29] Brandon when he makes this statement, he
[1:18:30] says, "If I ever had a time of success
[1:18:32] of praying for anyone, it's when I could
[1:18:35] enter into the fellowship with them and
[1:18:36] I could feel their infirmities, feel
[1:18:39] their conditions, then something in you
[1:18:41] goes down beyond the reasoning." And
[1:18:44] prays the prayer of faith for the sick.
[1:18:47] He said, "You got to feel for a man.
[1:18:49] You've got to sympathize with him.
[1:18:51] You've got to be with him before you can
[1:18:53] help him. And then you enter into some
[1:18:55] sort of a deepness. It's the love of
[1:18:57] God. It's beyond human
[1:19:01] love. So I want to just say to you here
[1:19:04] tonight as a believer, you have the same
[1:19:07] authority. Amen. In praying for the
[1:19:10] sick, you have the same authority. No
[1:19:12] doubt you you could go back in your mind
[1:19:15] and you could remember times praying for
[1:19:16] your children and on and on, loved ones,
[1:19:19] so forth, but you have the same
[1:19:21] authority. Brother Bram says if your
[1:19:22] pastor happens not to be in town or or
[1:19:25] he's not right there close by you. He
[1:19:27] said you don't have to wait till a
[1:19:28] divine healing program comes in to be
[1:19:30] healed. He said maybe there your pastor
[1:19:32] might be off somewhere but that good
[1:19:34] Holy Ghost fililled sister or brother
[1:19:36] that lives next door to you has the same
[1:19:39] authority.
[1:19:41] Is that right? He said that minister has
[1:19:43] just as much right or any other minister
[1:19:45] or not only a minister but any Christian
[1:19:46] who's a believer to pray with faith the
[1:19:49] prayer of faith. Anybody who believes in
[1:19:52] praying for the sick, believes in divine
[1:19:54] believes in divine healing. Anybody,
[1:19:56] woman, man, boy or girl, how many say,
[1:20:00] "Lord, I believe
[1:20:05] right there." Watch. He said, "I've seen
[1:20:08] my little girl that's only three years
[1:20:10] old,
[1:20:12] only three." Prayed for a crippled child
[1:20:16] and it was healed for her little heart.
[1:20:19] Watch. watch her little heart begin to
[1:20:21] beat. She said, "Daddy, look at that
[1:20:24] little girl." I said, "You I said, "Pray
[1:20:26] for her, honey." And a week or two from
[1:20:29] that, the child was well. Didn't you
[1:20:31] catch how Brother Ram said that? Brother
[1:20:32] Ram didn't say, "Oh, go pray for her."
[1:20:34] But he caught that. She was burdened for
[1:20:37] that little girl.
[1:20:39] Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When God gives
[1:20:44] you a burden for somebody, that's why I
[1:20:46] say, "God, let me just be sensitive. I
[1:20:48] don't want to be wrapped up in my own
[1:20:50] world. Amen. I don't I don't want to be
[1:20:52] wrapped up. It's so easy. We're living
[1:20:54] in an age where the spirits of this age.
[1:20:56] It's about self. That's a sign of a
[1:20:59] peerless time. Lovers of themselves.
[1:21:02] It's a spirit that's out there. God, I
[1:21:05] don't want to be wrapped up. I can
[1:21:06] become so wrapped up in my life that I
[1:21:08] can I can set. You know how it is? You
[1:21:10] can sit in the same house and not even
[1:21:11] know what's going on with the people in
[1:21:13] your house.
[1:21:16] Is that right? Yeah, we can do that
[1:21:18] within the church as well. I'm not
[1:21:20] telling us to become social bunnies. I'm
[1:21:23] telling us that we are believers. Amen.
[1:21:25] We're part of a body of believers and
[1:21:28] and God help me to be sensitive to where
[1:21:31] that if God he can drop that burden,
[1:21:33] then look, your
[1:21:35] prayer is what's needed. Amen.
[1:21:40] God's entrusted that burden to you to
[1:21:43] pray for him,
[1:21:45] to enter in for him.
[1:21:48] And a week or two from there, the child
[1:21:49] was well. God hears anybody's cry
[1:21:52] that'll believe. And that's the reason
[1:21:55] you ask others to believe because you're
[1:21:57] binding your faith together to move away
[1:22:01] that power of doubt.
[1:22:05] Brother said, "Divine healing does not
[1:22:07] lay in any man anyhow." It's in a
[1:22:10] finished work. Your faith in a finished
[1:22:13] work. A gift of healing is merely a gift
[1:22:17] of healing. A gift of faith for healing.
[1:22:20] Now, a gift of healing does not have to
[1:22:23] be a pastor. It can be a lay member. The
[1:22:26] leoty can have the same thing. I
[1:22:28] remember you've heard me refer to it
[1:22:30] many times. Brother Bramble will refer
[1:22:32] to this of that little lady who she saw
[1:22:35] the the other sister with the baby
[1:22:37] standing and she became so burdened on
[1:22:40] her heart and she thought, "No, no, I I
[1:22:42] can't go. I can't go pray for her. I
[1:22:44] can't go pray for that baby. And then
[1:22:46] she got up and she said, she seen her
[1:22:48] standing. She said, would you take my
[1:22:50] seat, please? I see you standing with
[1:22:52] that child. Would you here? You can have
[1:22:54] my seat. And then she went on how
[1:22:56] Brother Bram goes through to describe it
[1:22:58] that she just got so on her heart and
[1:23:00] she said, "Would you mind if I just got
[1:23:02] this off of my heart?" Brother Bram said
[1:23:04] she was just a common little church
[1:23:06] girl, little mother. I like how those
[1:23:08] details are put in there. Amen. because
[1:23:11] she got on her heart. She said, ' Would
[1:23:13] you just mind if I just get this off my
[1:23:14] heart that I can't get it on my heart to
[1:23:16] pray for your baby, but I want you when
[1:23:19] that prayer card is called and I pray
[1:23:21] that it is, I want you to go up there
[1:23:22] and let Brother Brandon pray for it.
[1:23:24] Because she was struggling, the person
[1:23:27] who was being moved by God, she looked
[1:23:29] at it and said, "Lord, I can't pray for
[1:23:31] that baby. Brother Brandon's going to
[1:23:33] pray for that baby." But see, God was
[1:23:36] putting it on her heart. You see what it
[1:23:38] was? She had a feeling for that baby.
[1:23:41] And that's why brother Ram said when the
[1:23:43] result came forth and the little mother
[1:23:46] passed through with that child up here
[1:23:48] and I love how brother Ram described it.
[1:23:50] He said that that little one that had
[1:23:51] prayed, that little lady that had prayed
[1:23:53] for the other, she was sitting there
[1:23:54] saying, "Oh, thank you, God, that her
[1:23:56] prayer card was called. Thank you, Lord,
[1:23:58] that her prayer card was called." And
[1:24:00] when she got up here, Yes. Amen. said,
[1:24:03] "Your baby had such and such and such
[1:24:05] and such disease, but it's already
[1:24:07] healed. He was healed when this sister
[1:24:09] before the service prayed for. I don't
[1:24:11] just look at the healing, but I'm
[1:24:12] watching. I've always watched how that
[1:24:14] person was with the burden on their
[1:24:16] heart. They were still wanting that
[1:24:19] individual. Oh God, thank you that their
[1:24:21] prayer card was healed. Because you know
[1:24:24] why? To God be the glory.
[1:24:27] To God be the glory. With the desire for
[1:24:30] one thing, to see the body helped and
[1:24:32] edified. That's right. This is why
[1:24:34] brother Ram says if you feel led just go
[1:24:37] to the end of it there. If you feel led
[1:24:39] to go pray for somebody go do it. That's
[1:24:42] if you've got the Holy Spirit. God is
[1:24:44] leading you to do those things. He said
[1:24:47] I believe that gifts of healing it's in
[1:24:49] the church. Don't have to even be don't
[1:24:51] have to be a preacher even just a lay
[1:24:53] member feels led to go pray for somebody
[1:24:55] go do it. That's a gift of healing
[1:24:58] working in you. Now, let me just switch
[1:25:01] over here very quickly on the working of
[1:25:03] miracles. This isn't I'm not going to
[1:25:05] spend a long time on this, but just to
[1:25:08] switch over here on this on to another
[1:25:11] the working of miracles. Now you know
[1:25:14] brother Brandham will take then he's
[1:25:16] very careful to continue to deal with
[1:25:20] among the people among these things even
[1:25:23] when it comes to um in divine healing
[1:25:26] that there there's a difference miracles
[1:25:30] brother Brham said even when there's a
[1:25:32] vision that's given hey that's a miracle
[1:25:34] that's supernatural when a vision is
[1:25:36] given but with miracles themselves these
[1:25:39] are things that take place uh either
[1:25:43] right there or it's just right shortly
[1:25:44] after. It's just it happens.
[1:25:47] And that's nothing that is that that is
[1:25:50] just sovereignly given by God.
[1:25:53] It's sovereignly given by
[1:25:55] God. But then there's also that of that
[1:25:58] gift of healing that praying for
[1:26:01] healing. Sometimes there's miracles in
[1:26:02] that, sometimes it's not. You can see
[1:26:04] how they overlap. But there's other
[1:26:06] times where a word will just drop
[1:26:07] through the preaching. Right? Remember,
[1:26:09] brother Brandham, if you listen to works
[1:26:11] as faith express, he's one he said, "Oh,
[1:26:13] I want to have an oldfashioned prayer
[1:26:15] line." This is one of the last few
[1:26:16] messages he preached. But he he says, "I
[1:26:19] I want to speak to you on the real basic
[1:26:22] of divine healing." And he deals with
[1:26:24] the bedding ground, the good ground
[1:26:26] that's able to receive the seed. And
[1:26:28] he's dealing with it's got to be faith
[1:26:30] that drops that faith and how that'll
[1:26:32] drop in your heart. And I love how
[1:26:33] Brother Brham says that in that message.
[1:26:34] He says, look, he says, don't just, it
[1:26:37] can't just be something on the
[1:26:38] intellectual, but I like how he says,
[1:26:40] but but but he said, if that's all it is
[1:26:42] right now, just hold on to that and keep
[1:26:46] confessing that promise. And he said,
[1:26:49] it'll drop down there.
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:54] I'll tell you friends, I love this. I
[1:26:56] love the message of the hour. You know
[1:26:57] why? Cuz it don't it just doesn't put
[1:26:59] things in a box. It don't just leave you
[1:27:01] without a way out. Cuz you see, you know
[1:27:03] how it is. The devil, that guy's, I tell
[1:27:06] you, he he's not as faithful as God, but
[1:27:08] he's he's faithful. He's faithful to get
[1:27:10] on your shoulder and want to run you
[1:27:11] down and tell you why this or that and
[1:27:13] so forth. But look how the prophet will
[1:27:15] take that. Hey, we're not going to be
[1:27:16] troubled if that's all it is right now.
[1:27:18] It's in in your mind. Take it and keep
[1:27:20] confessing it and God will bring it to
[1:27:23] pass.
[1:27:25] So, there's a difference and brother, he
[1:27:28] wants to just establish this difference
[1:27:30] when he's talking about this workings of
[1:27:32] miracles. And he said many of you gets
[1:27:33] the wrong conception of divine healing.
[1:27:36] This is not a gift to perform
[1:27:39] miracles. Miracles is a separate and
[1:27:42] different gift from healing. It's a
[1:27:45] miracle every time when somebody a
[1:27:48] vision happens tells people what's wrong
[1:27:50] with them. That's a miracle. It's
[1:27:51] supernatural. That's a miracle. Now, he
[1:27:53] says, "Look, when Isaiah went up to heal
[1:27:56] uh Hezekiah, he said, he said, "You you
[1:27:59] believe God sent him up there and you
[1:28:01] believe after he told him he was going
[1:28:02] to die, set his house in order?" Well,
[1:28:04] when Isaiah went up and pronounced him
[1:28:06] to be healed, it was three days before
[1:28:09] Hezekiah regained enough strength to
[1:28:11] come down off his bed and go in the
[1:28:13] house of God to
[1:28:15] worship. And remember, he also was
[1:28:18] instructed to put figs.
[1:28:20] Right now, I don't know if he got the
[1:28:22] figs from Duterra or Young
[1:28:24] Living. I don't know if they came in a
[1:28:26] bottle, but I know one thing. Isaiah had
[1:28:29] the real essential oil of the Holy
[1:28:32] Ghost. Are you hearing me? And he put
[1:28:35] that. Remember, it was the figs that he
[1:28:37] instructed him. But this is my point. It
[1:28:40] was healing. It was three days before he
[1:28:43] got off the bed. But it didn't matter.
[1:28:46] It was finished in his heart. Amen. as
[1:28:49] soon as Isaiah spoke to him. See, that's
[1:28:52] the how divine healing will work.
[1:28:55] Sometimes it's a miracle right there. Or
[1:28:57] maybe you'll find it right after you get
[1:28:59] home. But then other times it's dropped
[1:29:01] and that's it. I I don't know how, but
[1:29:02] it's dropped. It's settled. I've got
[1:29:04] peace. It's it's just settled. And that
[1:29:06] that is something that when that happens
[1:29:08] in that way and we understand it, then
[1:29:11] it doesn't give the enemy any room to
[1:29:13] work.
[1:29:14] Brother Bram says it like this. He says,
[1:29:16] "If you had a cut on your hand, you done
[1:29:18] something for it, uh you done you done
[1:29:20] everything for it, just kept it just
[1:29:22] kept getting worse." After a while, you
[1:29:24] put something on your hands, it began to
[1:29:26] help. But it didn't get well, it's
[1:29:29] getting well. See, it didn't get well.
[1:29:32] Soon as you put that ointment on, right?
[1:29:34] Like when you had that cut on your hand,
[1:29:35] you put vitamin E on there, it all of a
[1:29:37] sudden, hey, hey, look. You didn't run
[1:29:38] out. Hey, Barb, look, look, look, look,
[1:29:40] look my hand. You didn't run out there
[1:29:42] like that. It you put that vitamin E and
[1:29:44] all that right there. And it's it's
[1:29:45] getting well, right? And that's what the
[1:29:47] prophet said. It's it's getting well.
[1:29:49] And when the curse of sickness is taken
[1:29:52] off you, not every time is it a miracle.
[1:29:57] Sometimes it happens spontaneously.
[1:29:59] Sometimes the curse is just gone and the
[1:30:02] cure follows it. He said, "Now listen,
[1:30:05] there's a hardly a time that within the
[1:30:07] space of 72 hours after a healing has
[1:30:09] taken place until Satan's right back at
[1:30:12] the place again. Cuz when the unclean
[1:30:14] spirit's gone out of the man, he walks
[1:30:16] in dry places and he'll return with
[1:30:19] seven other demons worse than himself.
[1:30:22] So the good man of the house, what is
[1:30:24] the good man of the house?
[1:30:25] Faith. So you know it's it's you say,
[1:30:29] well, why would brother Ram take that to
[1:30:31] explain that? Because we don't know how
[1:30:35] things are going to come out in terms of
[1:30:37] is it going to be spontaneous or not.
[1:30:39] It's just it's simple. We're coming with
[1:30:42] with an approach with faith in God's
[1:30:44] word. And look, if it doesn't happen
[1:30:46] right here in this moment, we're going
[1:30:48] to hold right on to him,
[1:30:51] it's it's something that's dropped in
[1:30:52] our heart. And it could just be that the
[1:30:55] curse has been spoken to
[1:30:59] and the cure will follow. Yeah. Now the
[1:31:02] scripture tells us that when the
[1:31:04] disciples went about the Lord as they
[1:31:06] went preaching and teaching the Lord was
[1:31:09] working with them and confirming the
[1:31:11] word with signs following. Now notice he
[1:31:15] was confirming the word. This is where
[1:31:17] the signs following and the miracles
[1:31:19] were being done. Even with this man at
[1:31:21] the gate called beautiful. The Bible
[1:31:23] said this man was above 40 years old on
[1:31:26] whom this miracle of healing was done.
[1:31:28] Right. Mhm. See, it was a miracle. It
[1:31:31] was a healing, but it was miraculous. It
[1:31:33] was spontaneous. He stood up, received
[1:31:35] strength right there. Right. Same thing
[1:31:36] with Paul. When Paul perceived that man
[1:31:38] had faith and he was preaching that
[1:31:40] time, he perceived he had faith and
[1:31:41] said, "Stand up." Right? It was it was a
[1:31:44] miracle. It was spontaneous. It wasn't
[1:31:46] healing. Like brother Bram says, the
[1:31:47] regular procedure where it just you
[1:31:49] you're prayed for, it drops, and you
[1:31:52] wait for it to come to pass. And this is
[1:31:55] why when brother Brandon says miracles
[1:31:57] has always stumped the unbeliever. Just
[1:31:59] the same our heavenly father is a
[1:32:01] miracle working God. Everywhere he's
[1:32:04] been, whatever his ministryy's been,
[1:32:05] wherever he's had his ministers, there's
[1:32:07] always been signs, wonders, and
[1:32:09] miracles. The scripture said Stephen was
[1:32:12] full of faith and power and did great
[1:32:14] wonders and miracles among the people.
[1:32:17] Well, Stephen didn't do it, but he was
[1:32:19] the vessel that God did it through.
[1:32:23] And this God used Stephen within his
[1:32:26] ministry. And now even when you look and
[1:32:28] consider of how that Philip here in Acts
[1:32:31] chapter 8, this is what I'm trying to
[1:32:32] even to see why God has a purpose even
[1:32:35] in all this that he'll do with the faith
[1:32:38] and the healings and the miracles.
[1:32:39] There's a purpose. God's not just doing
[1:32:41] this random. Remember, God doesn't do
[1:32:44] anything to clown or to show off. And
[1:32:46] and so when when they were scattered
[1:32:48] abroad after a great uh dispersion,
[1:32:50] trial and so forth among the church,
[1:32:53] verse 5, Philip went down to the city of
[1:32:55] Samaria, preached Christ unto them, and
[1:32:57] the people with one accord gave heed
[1:33:00] unto the things which Philip spake,
[1:33:02] hearing and seeing the miracles which he
[1:33:04] did. For unclean spirits crying with
[1:33:06] loud voice came out of many that were
[1:33:08] possessed with them, and many taken with
[1:33:10] pauses that were lame were healed. What
[1:33:14] was they doing? They heard the word
[1:33:16] being preached and no doubt it was an
[1:33:18] atmosphere and that their faith God
[1:33:22] taking a hold as the word was being
[1:33:24] ministered and then God was right with
[1:33:26] them to confirm his word. And you know
[1:33:29] why brother Bram says it like this. He
[1:33:31] says when God sends he says not only all
[1:33:34] these five ministerial gifts but God
[1:33:36] sends all these other gifts. He said
[1:33:38] what it is, it's God's divine approach
[1:33:41] so that when this is made known and
[1:33:44] declared, the people can see that's the
[1:33:47] approach to God.
[1:33:50] It's God making himself known among us.
[1:33:54] That's what brother said. This
[1:33:55] discernment that's taking place up here
[1:33:57] on the platform, he said it catches.
[1:34:00] Remember, divine healing is what? Bait
[1:34:03] on the hook,
[1:34:05] right? It's not the end goal, right?
[1:34:07] Right. I mean, you don't you don't you
[1:34:09] know, catch the fish and take get out of
[1:34:11] here and eat and turn around and eat the
[1:34:14] bait.
[1:34:15] I mean, depends you if you've got carp
[1:34:17] or what. I don't know, you know, but but
[1:34:19] you may debate then, you know, but
[1:34:21] anyhow, you don't but it's bait on the
[1:34:24] hook. What is that? And let me just tell
[1:34:25] you something. When you and I can even,
[1:34:28] you know, hearing the message of the
[1:34:29] hour and then maybe seeing deep call to
[1:34:32] deep, let me just tell you something.
[1:34:34] You and I are not being held here
[1:34:36] because of of signs and wonders and
[1:34:39] miracles, but there's things that begin
[1:34:41] to resonate in our heart. And what we
[1:34:43] saw, we said, "That's more than a man.
[1:34:46] That's not a man." And something that
[1:34:48] you saw was different. This is not a hit
[1:34:50] and miss. And somebody here with a green
[1:34:53] dress has a backachche and maybe 50
[1:34:55] people like that. But this was somebody
[1:34:58] who knew the situation right down to the
[1:35:01] address.
[1:35:04] and then hear the hear that gets your
[1:35:05] attention and that's all God wanted to
[1:35:08] do because what does that do? The
[1:35:10] prophet said when you see those things
[1:35:12] taking place then it causes you to look
[1:35:15] in your life and say if God can do that
[1:35:17] with that situation what about my life
[1:35:21] not just healing but in any phase of
[1:35:24] your life
[1:35:26] it's God building faith and then he
[1:35:28] comes right around and starts laying in
[1:35:30] the word and what is the word it's the
[1:35:33] reading of the pedigree of your marriage
[1:35:35] certificate
[1:35:37] so good and That's where our faith
[1:35:40] becomes anchored in the word of God. Our
[1:35:42] faith, our experience is a word
[1:35:45] experience.
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:47] Glory be to God. And let me tell you
[1:35:50] something, God ain't throwing back the
[1:35:52] rainbow trout.
[1:35:55] This is what he went fishing for. He
[1:35:57] sent this message to get rainbow trout.
[1:35:59] God didn't take rainbow trout and say,
[1:36:01] "Oh my, look at this worm." No. The worm
[1:36:04] divine healing was on the hook to catch
[1:36:06] the rainbow trout.
[1:36:10] [Applause]
[1:36:12] But Samuel, I've known people that, you
[1:36:14] know, they come in contact with it and
[1:36:16] and you know, well, it's not for them.
[1:36:21] That is even ought to show every time
[1:36:23] within that of God's God's elective
[1:36:26] grace to you and I, it's nothing that
[1:36:27] we've done. We didn't believe enough and
[1:36:31] oh, one night, one night I got so
[1:36:33] desperate. No, the only way you could
[1:36:34] get desperate. I understand we have to
[1:36:36] get desperate. But you know the only way
[1:36:38] you could get desperate is because
[1:36:39] there's something in you to respond to
[1:36:41] the pulling of God.
[1:36:43] That's what it's about. It a it's not
[1:36:45] about you or oh I sought after God. No.
[1:36:47] The only reason you started that started
[1:36:49] rising in your heart getting stronger
[1:36:51] and stronger is because the magnet of
[1:36:54] his presence of his revealed word was
[1:36:57] moving upon your life. You're in the
[1:36:59] season, in the bedding of ground of time
[1:37:02] that God ordained for you to be in that
[1:37:05] the word would come to pass in your life
[1:37:07] and express itself in your life.
[1:37:11] Hallelujah. Where's denomination at
[1:37:14] then? Where's your efforts at then?
[1:37:16] Where's man's idea? Where's it at? It's
[1:37:18] nothing but Jesus.
[1:37:24] Hallelujah. You kind of feel like Peter.
[1:37:26] Let's build one to Moses. Let's build
[1:37:28] one to Elijah. And about that time, he
[1:37:30] said, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye
[1:37:34] him."
[1:37:37] What you see is Jesus only.
[1:37:42] Hallelujah. God was bearing witness,
[1:37:44] bearing them witness both with signs and
[1:37:46] wonders, divers, different kinds of
[1:37:48] miracles, gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:51] according to his own right will. So God
[1:37:55] was dispensing what was needed for that
[1:37:59] time. Right? How many of you I mean you
[1:38:02] could go right through the book of Acts.
[1:38:03] How many you remember you know Paul this
[1:38:06] one right here who it talks about how
[1:38:07] that Paul remember he he was there
[1:38:09] debating in the synagogue and all of a
[1:38:11] sudden they were such an
[1:38:13] uphe. So you know what God pulled those
[1:38:16] that did want to hear it out. That's
[1:38:17] what the scripture said. Pulled them out
[1:38:19] and then God got what did he do? He got
[1:38:21] them believers out of there and Paul
[1:38:23] kept on working with them. And the Bible
[1:38:25] says God God wrought special miracles by
[1:38:29] the hands of Paul. What was that? That
[1:38:31] was for the children of God.
[1:38:34] That was to encourage them.
[1:38:37] Hallelujah. It's just like the same
[1:38:39] deputy that wanted to try to keep Paul
[1:38:41] in Acts 13. He didn't want, you know, he
[1:38:43] didn't want his uh his boss to believe,
[1:38:46] right? So Paul, remember Paul looked
[1:38:48] upon him and the spirit of God struck
[1:38:51] Paul and Paul said, "Oh, that child full
[1:38:54] of sility. Thou shalt be blind for a
[1:38:57] season." That happened. And his boss who
[1:39:01] was already hungering,
[1:39:04] he came to see the word.
[1:39:07] Why did God do that? Not to show
[1:39:10] himself, but it was for that one who
[1:39:13] wanted to believe.
[1:39:16] Aren't you glad that God knows just how
[1:39:18] to
[1:39:32] Do you love him?
[1:39:38] Brother Brandham, can we all do
[1:39:41] miracles?
[1:39:43] Yes.
[1:39:45] When you're directed by the Holy Ghost
[1:39:48] to do miracles, go do it because it's
[1:39:52] Holy Spirit directed.
[1:39:55] talking about that little woman who
[1:39:56] prayed for that other's baby. If that
[1:39:58] woman wouldn't have carried that out,
[1:40:00] what God told her, perhaps there would
[1:40:01] have been a rebuke in the spirit to her,
[1:40:03] she'd have disobeyed God. Always, if
[1:40:05] you're a Christian and something is
[1:40:08] persuading you to do something, go do
[1:40:10] it. Don't doubt it. Go do it. Everything
[1:40:14] in its time, season, order, right in its
[1:40:16] place, right? Everything within its
[1:40:19] season. but to see God supplies the
[1:40:22] needs right through all of these things.
[1:40:25] You love him.
[1:40:27] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's stand.
[1:40:36] You could read on and on of different
[1:40:37] ones with miracles had different things
[1:40:39] in here of Ireneius
[1:40:44] and St. Martin.
[1:40:47] I and just God just moving among his
[1:40:52] people in a special
[1:40:55] way. And I believe that God I believe
[1:40:58] God wants to move more in our lives.
[1:41:00] Yes. Amen. I I believe
[1:41:02] that you know I'm the only thing that
[1:41:05] I'm looking for is looking for more of
[1:41:07] him because if I'm looking for more of
[1:41:10] him then I'm looking in the right place.
[1:41:12] That's right. because I I want to I want
[1:41:14] to be so in tune with the giver because
[1:41:16] I need we need his leadership and his
[1:41:18] wisdom for the gifts that he has. But
[1:41:21] you know what he everything that he that
[1:41:23] we have need of is in him.
[1:41:26] Amen. And if anything at all that we
[1:41:29] would draw from this here is to
[1:41:31] recognize that you know what brother
[1:41:33] Bram would say it over and over many of
[1:41:35] these quotes that I have here that I'd
[1:41:36] aim read to you. Brother Brandon says,
[1:41:39] "Don't ever think that I'm just a lay
[1:41:42] member. I can't pray for anyone." Don't
[1:41:45] ever think that. He said, "If God moves
[1:41:47] in your heart, then you obey God." It's
[1:41:51] you you're not it's not you promising
[1:41:53] anyone a miracle. We don't know how it's
[1:41:55] going to come out. We don't know how the
[1:41:58] We don't know what what's going to take
[1:41:59] place. But I know this right here. If we
[1:42:01] just be sensitive to God, then you know
[1:42:04] what? God will move as as as the needs
[1:42:06] are present. You believe that? And we're
[1:42:10] also very much after coming out even of
[1:42:12] a service, we've witnessed this right
[1:42:13] here in this assembly where right
[1:42:15] through the preaching of the word
[1:42:18] situations. God has
[1:42:20] moved. Healing has taken place.
[1:42:23] Deliverance. So we don't limiting God,
[1:42:26] but it's however that God would choose
[1:42:28] to move. And so we don't have to say, as
[1:42:31] I said earlier, oh, I got to wait till
[1:42:32] the end of the service. You don't have
[1:42:33] to wait till the end of the service. You
[1:42:35] can draw on El Shadi right now.
[1:42:39] If you for us to have hands laid on us,
[1:42:42] that's no sign of a weakness of faith.
[1:42:45] That's a promise in God's word. So,
[1:42:49] we're not going to let the devil put us
[1:42:50] in a corner and shame us. Well, you
[1:42:53] should be the bride of Jesus Christ. You
[1:42:55] should have perfect faith. You should
[1:42:58] you see you you have to
[1:43:00] discern is this thing lifting me up or
[1:43:03] running me down.
[1:43:05] If it's running you down, it's the
[1:43:08] devil.
[1:43:09] He likes to be little. You know what
[1:43:12] he's trying to do? His whole thing is
[1:43:14] trying to break your confidence. But let
[1:43:16] me just tell you, every promise in the
[1:43:19] book is mine.
[1:43:22] Everyone.
[1:43:24] Everyone. Let's just pray.
[1:43:29] Maybe why don't we just Would you mind
[1:43:31] laying hands on one another? Would that
[1:43:33] be all right? You may have to slip out
[1:43:35] of your seat. I just was going to pray.
[1:43:37] I just in my heart I think that would be
[1:43:39] I think it'd be very fitting right now.
[1:43:41] Maybe a sister to the sister, husband
[1:43:44] and wife, however that you would you
[1:43:46] would feel comfortable. I want you to be
[1:43:47] comfortable. But if you need to slip to
[1:43:49] somewhere else and buy somebody, feel
[1:43:52] free to do that.
[1:43:56] Hallelujah. Heavenly
[1:44:00] Father, Lord Jesus, we certainly stand
[1:44:03] here as believers, Lord, by the grace of
[1:44:08] God. Lord, I know
[1:44:10] that you're all that we have need of.
[1:44:13] There's many needs, many situations that
[1:44:16] can be, Lord, right here among us
[1:44:18] tonight. No doubt, Lord, things that you
[1:44:21] have spoke to our hearts already.
[1:44:23] answers that's come. There's needs,
[1:44:26] Lord. And we're just, Lord God, as we
[1:44:28] obeying, Lord, in your word, you just
[1:44:32] said, "Lay hands on the sick and they
[1:44:34] shall recover." Lord, maybe my brother,
[1:44:36] my sister, maybe they're not sick. But,
[1:44:39] Father, we as a priest want to stand in
[1:44:42] on their behalf. And we want to offer up
[1:44:45] a prayer, Lord, because we in our own
[1:44:48] individual life know what Lord, it is
[1:44:50] the pressures of this age that we're
[1:44:52] living in, the times that we're living
[1:44:55] in, how seasons change and and things
[1:44:58] Lord come, pressures, disappointments on
[1:45:00] and on. So we understand many of those
[1:45:03] things, Lord, through personal
[1:45:05] experiences. Now, Father, is that that
[1:45:08] person that Lord that we would have our
[1:45:10] hands laid upon, I pray that God made
[1:45:13] that same quickening power that not only
[1:45:16] raised our Lord Jesus up from the grave,
[1:45:18] but Lord was sent back, Lord, to quicken
[1:45:21] that seed within our life to kill that
[1:45:24] old nature and raise up that real son
[1:45:26] and daughter of God on the inside. That
[1:45:29] place, Lord, where it's a sacred
[1:45:31] sands. Lord God, we know what you did
[1:45:34] for us there. So Lord God, as you healed
[1:45:38] us, Lord, in our soul, you changed us,
[1:45:42] Lord God. Now, Father, you're the same
[1:45:46] God for healing. You're the same God for
[1:45:49] the need that would be in my brother or
[1:45:51] my sister's life. May you move, Lord, I
[1:45:54] pray, upon these needs in a special way.
[1:45:57] I pray that God, may sickness, Lord,
[1:46:00] discouragement, oppression, depression,
[1:46:03] anxiety. I pray heavenly father may the
[1:46:06] peace of almighty God just move down
[1:46:10] Lord in such a wonderful way Lord. May
[1:46:13] Father I pray your presence Lord that we
[1:46:15] sense Lord to be here right with us
[1:46:17] right now. I pray that God may it just
[1:46:20] come Lord like a refreshing Lord and an
[1:46:23] energizing oh God to the inner man that
[1:46:26] Father as we would walk out of this
[1:46:28] building tonight Lord. Oh, Father, our
[1:46:30] hearts have been renewed, have been
[1:46:32] refreshed in your presence, Lord. Our
[1:46:35] vision, Lord, has been renewed. And
[1:46:37] Father, we have been strengthened, Lord.
[1:46:40] Granted, Lord, I pray for we were a
[1:46:44] body. Lord, we're a body. And father,
[1:46:48] just like Lord, the nutrients travel
[1:46:50] through this body, the blood travels
[1:46:52] through the body carrying nutrients,
[1:46:54] oxygen, all of these other things, then
[1:46:56] Lord God, I pray may the spirit of the
[1:46:59] living God just move, Lord, through this
[1:47:01] body tonight, Lord, in the visible and
[1:47:03] invisible audience, Lord God, I pray for
[1:47:06] every need, Lord, as we place it before
[1:47:09] the throne of God under the name of the
[1:47:12] Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of
[1:47:15] God. Amen. And amen. Thank you,
[1:47:20] Jesus. Thank you,
[1:47:22] Jesus. Thank you,
[1:47:24] Lord. You are

[1:48:47] you. Oh, I want to be a vessel you were.
[1:48:53] Yes,
[1:48:56] I want to be more like

[1:49:04] time. That's our prayer. Yes,
[1:49:08] Lord. more like you,

[1:49:26] through.
[1:49:28] Hallelujah. Oh, I want to be more like
[1:49:36] you. You know, you think about that. how
[1:49:39] sometimes with the circumstances of life
[1:49:41] that we go
[1:49:43] through. And earlier this evening, I was
[1:49:45] thinking about with that little lady I
[1:49:48] talked about that had that burden or
[1:49:50] that God put that burden on her heart.
[1:49:52] And you
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] know, a good friend, Brother Nathan
[1:49:57] Bryant,
[1:49:58] he was talking to me the one time when
[1:50:01] brother Billy Paul had had, you know,
[1:50:02] come there to to the church and to
[1:50:05] visit, you know, at different times.
[1:50:06] There was family and so forth.
[1:50:09] And there was a a couple that had been
[1:50:10] trying to have a
[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:13] baby over and over and over. It was just
[1:50:17] at a point of
[1:50:18] just Brother
[1:50:20] Nathan, this is to me why I I I love
[1:50:23] things like this. He looked back there
[1:50:24] and he seen Brother Billy. He said,
[1:50:25] "Brother Billy, would you come here and
[1:50:28] would you pray with this family?" Now,
[1:50:31] yeah. How many How many of you been
[1:50:32] there to see Brother Bram's grave
[1:50:34] marker? Yeah. When you turn and look
[1:50:37] this way away from the tabernacle, the
[1:50:40] tabernacle will be down that way. When
[1:50:42] you look over here, you see all these
[1:50:44] little
[1:50:47] placards, stones around where brother
[1:50:49] Billy and Sister Lois are. You know what
[1:50:53] it is? It's steel burn, stillborn
[1:50:57] children. So many different ones were
[1:50:59] lost. And so with the children that
[1:51:02] brother Billy Paul has, if there's
[1:51:03] somebody, and I know there's others that
[1:51:05] could enter in, he came and he prayed. I
[1:51:09] don't have to tell you the
[1:51:10] result. God moved and gave that couple a
[1:51:13] baby.
[1:51:15] There's testimonies. I sat there with
[1:51:18] brother John Sanger and sat there with
[1:51:21] different ones
[1:51:23] um brother Billy's son and we sat there
[1:51:26] at the table and just sat there and
[1:51:28] talked about the amount of testimonies
[1:51:30] that's been throughout the world just
[1:51:32] just just on babies being born.
[1:51:39] We've got blue prayer cloths and pink
[1:51:40] prayer cloths. What color do you want?
[1:51:47] And they stood out. I I was just
[1:51:48] sitting. I was just standing in awe. But
[1:51:50] you see, this is my point within it. It
[1:51:53] wasn't brother
[1:51:54] Billy. He had a compassion
[1:51:57] for knowing what it was. Amen. To want a
[1:52:00] child and it not happen. And so because
[1:52:04] of that was able to enter in. I that's
[1:52:06] why I say that your your your
[1:52:08] circumstances of life, it's not just God
[1:52:11] proving to you who you are, but then
[1:52:14] through that God will turn right around
[1:52:16] and you'll be able to pray for that
[1:52:18] person's need.
[1:52:20] When God drops in on your heart like
[1:52:22] nobody else,
[1:52:24] you see what the devil meant for evil,
[1:52:26] God turns around for good.
[1:52:32] God is so good.
[1:52:34] He's so faithful.
[1:52:37] Oh Lord,
[1:52:40] I want to be more like you. Yes, I do.
[1:52:48] Jesus,
[1:52:50] I want to be more like
[1:52:55] you. Oh, I want to be a vessel you work
[1:53:02] through.
[1:53:05] I I want to be more like
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:11] you.
[1:53:12] Oh,
[1:53:15] I want to be more
[1:53:20] like
[1:53:23] Jesus. Oh, I want to be
[1:53:27] more like
[1:53:31] you. Help me Lord, I'll be a vessel. You
[1:53:36] work
