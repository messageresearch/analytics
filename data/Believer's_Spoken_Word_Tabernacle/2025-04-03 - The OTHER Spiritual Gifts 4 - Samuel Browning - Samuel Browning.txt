Lord that has been created not by an instrument but Lord from the hearts of your people that God were would begin to reach out and to Worship You Lord that would press Beyond tiredness press Beyond circumstances of Life weariness Gloom so many situations Lord sickness but oh God how it must must be so inviting and so delighting to you Lord when an atmosphere created Lord Jesus for you said you

said in your word I create Zion a praise Lord Jesus where your handiwork Lord and we're so thankful for your mercy Lord now father is these words Lord that we've sung were not alone dear God I pray may you just move Lord for each need in a special way father we realize Lord that as Believers that we we walk by faith that's true but Lord how we are so thankful for those times where we can feel your presence and Lord Jesus you know what we have need of tonight so we ask that God that you would grace us with your presence tonight Lord May our faith Lord I pray just just raising Lord to receive what you've already provided for us may you minister to every need those that Lord that request that were mentioned different ones Lord sickness may you just continue Lord to sweep by their neighborhood Lord minister to them in a special way Lord we just commit Lord this service into your hands and every need Lord we place It Before the Throne of God and we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you tonight amen we want to go straight to the word of the Lord and want to go to First Corinthians chapter 12 here tonight and uh I want to if the Lord would just to to help us I'd like to finish out here tonight at least on that of the faith and then transition over here very quickly into that of gifts of healing and uh start into that here in verse 4 of 1 Corinthians 12 it says now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administration but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all or rather to profit all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom and to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit and to another Faith by the same spirit amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to continue to speak there tonight on those the other spiritual gifts we often times where we deal with uh so readily upon the three that would seem to be the most notable or as Paul would spend uh much of the time under the leading of the holy spirit in the direction of those three gifts and to realize that every gift and brother Brown would say it over and over through the message that if in each of these gifts if we can just have them completely under the control of the Holy Spirit and his leading brother brm says then you will watch what Pentecost would rise to and he would speak of of of that uh Glory of when the gifts themselves would be positioned and we realize over and over as we've said is that the gifts being put in their place does not mean that they've been put in storage nor have they been given away as though that they're no longer useful God put it in the body it will be here in the body until we are changed and it is a necessary part of the body however within that of gifts uh the nine spiritual gifts we recognize that within it um as we've looked at it that the operation of any of those is no sign or evidence of a Spirit-filled individual but it is as the prophet tells us the manifestation or the evidence that it is the spirit doing that work through the individual and this is where that the spirit of God that after the gifts have been uh restored then then God sends the message after isua Street has come along in 1906 then God sends the message of the hour and within that promise of the ministry of the son of man it puts everything within its place of where that it would should rightfully be and to know that every member uh one that would be baptized into the body of Jesus Christ the prophet said is subject to any one of these nine spiritual gifts at any time and so when we look at this we know that it's it's all about the unction and the leading of the Holy Spirit as we've been seeing this and what a what a glorious what a glorious uh way it is of god to display his attitude towards the church we know that his word is the ultimate and brother bam tells us that when these gifts even as they themselves would be manifest it's God's attitude towards the people it's God's attitude he said towards healing and most of these within different things within our lives much of it that we look at would a lot of times center around healing but I'm glad that God uh just does not have uh a word or even that of the gifts just to center around healing but God knows all of those things that we could even be faced with in life and even to where that the Holy Spirit can give us uh the word of wisdom and direction for our lives when things are set before us like he did for Solomon God can also give us that of of knowledge and just like brother Brown would give that example sometimes that would actually come together and you can see it reflected within prophecy and brother Brown would tell us about you know tell those in this community move out of the way right now because there's going to be a flood or so forth that's coming through there and you know see that's the mercy of God because every single time it doesn't happen that way there's been others that's experienced sometimes destruction to experience different things I think of I think of uh brother Doug Baker out there and uh Tucson Arizona and my wife and I were out there in the first part of November here he was in the midst of having a meeting and the meeting getting ready to start and a fire comes and burns down the church and they don't burn it all the way down but you know it just they weren't able to have the meetings as far as in that church and no doubt I mean what that would have meant or how that would have you know felt for them at the time but I'll tell you I was out there and to see that the work and things that was done and how beautiful it is it's gotten very much like a wood ceiling like this is set up and it's kind of almost like a an octagonal shape and things but you know sometimes we wonder and you know you can look at that and say well why didn't God warn them or why didn't God warn them or this one or that one but you know what God never promised that he would warn us every step of the way there might have been things nobody was there in the church there might have been things when we look at that flood that brother bam gives an example whether it's a flood move out of this neighborhood or whatever we understand this one thing that there's nothing can take our life until God's purpose has been fulfilled and so I'm thankful to the Lord to know that when we can rest within that to know that God does have everything in control it's in his it's in his hands it's in his season and so when we look at this here I want to just uh deal with this just a little bit more here on another fa by The Same Spirit and brother BR in dealing with this on that gift of faith he says it like this he says now I'll give you a little story of someone who came so you can see what faith is Faith is a gift itself you may have a portion of it but there is a gift of faith he said like some you some of you people anoint the sick and pray for them and you have a result now brother Bram goes on through that and I I read from that uh within the message because it's a common theme where even different ones remember they were asking brother Branham Tommy Osborne was one of them uh others that would ask brother Bram said when he would get ready to leave town they would ask brother Bram would you lay hands on me that God will give me that gift of healing and brother Bram says there's only one direct gift of healing only one direct gift of faith and he goes through all of those different gifts and to recognize that it's not something that lays within a man but it is that which comes from the the Fountain of almighty God and how that when we like the Bible tells us in Psalms 1 verse 1-3 the prophet will pull that out in restoration of the Bride tree and deal with of how that those streams that would be flowing out are the nine spiritual gifts and so to recognize that it's not something that is particular to one person can there be a person that God would seem to use uh very often yes this is why that brother Brandon would say even in different times when tongues would go forth he said now just be patient be quiet he says there's those here that have a gift of interpretation and recognizing that it seems to be within this individual like you'd say brother higab Botham is he here tonight because there would be a tendency or frequency within their lives you know I'm not I'm not in any way to try to figure that out I I just know that you know it's subject to anyone who is in the body and this is why brother Bram says you want to be setting reverent and sensitive because that interpretation might fall upon you so it's it's something to where that you sometimes we can see even in those Tendencies but yet it is God sovereignly moving and moving down in a special way with this gift of faith and brother B says a gift of faith is not something you take and do something with but a gift of faith is you just get yourself out of the way the gift is getting your own self out of the way so then when we recognize that it's something that is is is there that is appropriated by the word of God and God would you know as we looked at that last week that it's not the faith of the individual of the of the whoever is praying for us that heals us remember over and over in the scriptures we looked at it that Jesus would say according to your faith thy faith so so what it does it's putting it that Faith itself brother Ram will say this over and over in the message and I'll and I'll refer to one place here in a little bit where brother says I'm hearing so much of this about super duper faith and he said you know he said it's nonsense because he's dealing with that Faith itself is something that is Within Reach of every individual remember when they plied the blood down in Egypt they applied it with hup and brother B said hisop is a common weed he said that's what faith is Faith is common so it's not that we don't have faith but sometimes maybe our faith has gotten a little weak can God comes by to inspire our faith that's where with these gifts as they will come in many times within this of G gift of faith and Gifts of healing and and Gifts of Miracles and and these things it will come by to inspire our faith and that's why brother Brown would say oh the devil's getting nervous because he knows just a little bit more and just a little bit of Faith added and the devil's whipped so God is moving in such a way you know it's aware that you know Faith moving together like brother Ram says I'm going to put my faith with your faith and and our prayer joined together and and we're going to reach there and get the promise of God so you know God is not worried uh and looking at us and saying well you don't have the faith that's needed but God has confidence in his word that when Faith would move down in a sovereign way within a meeting God has confidence that that's what you and I have need of to be able to step right out and and if it's something just to move right on to our healing whatever it is that we can keep walking on with God and you know what there's times from here times here and there that we need these times the where that the spirit of God will just move down and and you know minister to us in such a such a special way to me I don't want to limit God in any way neither do I want to you know some way just you know as though that sometimes say well you know if if I really had Faith because you know the devil has such a way of being able to take quotes and actually isolate people from the blessings that they have need of brother B will say this in perfect Faith oh brother Bram I got all perfect Faith he said well if you had perfect Faith what are you doing up here in the prayer line you see how Satan will take a quote like that and he'll absolutely so run down and minimize the people of God as though that oh they're weak in faith let me just tell you something the promises also they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so it's no weakness of Faith cuz an action in order to even receive healing through hands being laid on it actually requires faith in the word of God so it's no it's no no less of Faith but you know what God can drop Faith right there within our hearts while we're hearing the word of God go forth things can be cleared out of our life hindrances and God can move right down in and just the word of God would just do for us what we have need of and when you look here at a gift of faith I I'm not going to read it here but you know in referring to when Israel came to the Red Sea the prophet tells us this gift of faith that Moses had in his life and how that when they came here to the Red Sea Moses prophesies in Exodus 14 and he tells them fear you not stand still and you'll see the salvation of the Lord which he'll show you today the Egyptians you see today you're not going to see him again no more the Lord's going to fight for you hold your peace and then when when he turns to the Lord God speaks to him and says very familiar to us why criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward so this gift of faith that was moved at the time and Moses prophesies I mean there is no question that this is faith that has rose up at that time as a matter fact brother Bram says it just like this uh in why Christ speak that this was not Moses's thought this was God moving down in a sovereign way even before that he prophesied and then after he prophesied God allowed us to see the humanity that would still be there and brother BR would say this over and over in why Christ speak he says isn't that just like us like humans he said isn't that just like me and he goes into place himself there but you see God inspires and and ministers to Moses to where then Moses Moses then would step forward and he and he encourages the people of God but he's speaking that they would go forward a faith to move forward and he takes that of the rod that God has given to him and he holds that out over the waters and the waters part and we know that Israel walked on over on dry land there's times where there's situations in our lives that are not always uh with that of physical healing it might be emotional healing it might be uh needs maybe on a job it might be situations that's come up with housing finances whatever it is sometimes God can use that of a gift of faith to operate right through that way to encourage you and I sometimes it'll come right while the preaching of the word is going forth because that's God's Ultimate Way is because when everything in order for it to hold out it's got to be based upon the word of God so there's times that God will work in that way and Inspire in that manner then again God can move down with that and a gift of faith in such a sovereign way uh operating it in a different way or in that manner notice how Paul here he is and you're familiar with this point in the scripture where Paul here he is he's he's ministering and the Bible says there was a certain man at Lyra impotent in his feet being a from his mother's womb who never had walked the same heard Paul speak now this is what's key he heard Paul PA speak Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and notice who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had Faith to be healed now what was that that caused that Faith to arise it was the preaching of the word of God it became so clear to this man it became so tangible to where that God would direct Paul to actually see that this man had Faith to be healed and he tells him with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked and so now brother brandham will will give different examples of those within even the body at that time that God was using and he says you know I've seen Oral Roberts praying for a little sick baby up in Canada had a bad eye I believe the parents was Catholic and brother Roberts in his real way of of Faith he slammed his hand down on the little baby and prayed for it and the little baby was healed and brother BR said now that's a real gift of faith that brother Roberts has and we know that brother Jack Cole he used to have a little Anvil laying by the side of his desk now remember anytime people came up and glasses and you know crutches snap he he would smash them right on the Anvil snap them and and everything else now that was Jack Cole remember his faith brother ram calls this a bulldog faith and you know these men were so built within that part of Faith within the promises of God's word remember what brother Ram says and we'll get to this a little bit later on down the line in Gifts of healing he said if I could preach like AA Allen I wouldn't have to have the prayer lines because he spoke of how AA Allen was gifted to be able to build the faith of the People by the word of God now you know to me then you know when I'm listening to the message of the hour I I don't have to wait to a prayer line in order for my faith to be built you know what's being built is the is the word as God the presence of God remember it's the word of God that brings the presence of God in the beginning when there was darkness and void upon the Earth the Bible says that God said let there be light so it was the word brother B said that spoke to the darkness give way that the light can shine through so that's exactly when the word comes within that way it's to scatter the darkness and build our faith within the promise of God's word now brother br will go on and he'll talk about you know with brother Roberts and and and them and he says now brother Roberts is the gift of healing he prays and lays hands on the sick like that and got a real dominating hard as we'd call it Bulldog faith it just stands up there with his eyes closed and he believes that God will do it if he ask it and just lays his hands on the people as they pass by and that's what the Bible said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so here's a here's a gift a gift of faith and brother BR would pick out two individuals you know there's others that that would be there you could have picked out AA Allen all the rest of them and you you can look and say with some of some that you mentioned brother Samuel along with different ones Richard Hall on and on all these different ones you could pull out and say but but what about there's certain things I heard about their lives remember the non-spiritual gifts how that these very things can work through a life and yet the life itself not be genuine is that right this is why that we don't follow gifts we follow the word because if you follow a gift it could lead you right out of the word is that right balam himself the prophet said had a gift of faith oh he said it could have been a blessing if he would have used it with the perfect word of God but you know what it was balam was not willing to surrender I know he was a prophet all that worked in his life but he wasn't willing to actually come under the subjection of the word because even when God told him the first time not to go down there with BAC or bik's men and then you know he said nope I can't go I God I I just can't go with you then here came back others with different treasure and remember when they came back balam at that moment could have said God don't change his mind I I don't care how much money you have to offer me God don't change his mind but because this is what the prophet says it was still in his heart that's why he went and asked is that right that's why brother B says oh be careful for the what the desires of your heart is he said because God will give you the desires of your heart and that's why he'll refer him back in in uh in uh choosing of a bride and you know brother B will say you say oh like that of a sister oh God called me to preach God told me to preach brother Ram said I don't say that he didn't he said but have you heard my message on balum balum got the clear-cut answer from God but he still wanted to do what he wanted to do so good so sometimes this is why when somebody said God told me to do something I don't doubt that I'm not down and say well God didn't tell you to do it because of this no you ought to understand is that sometimes God just says go ahead and do what you're going to do oh my I want to do what he wants me to do I I want to do according to the word I want everything I want I want my whole life not just not just a gift and as a minister and as a pastor but as a husband as a father as a brother I want it all under the word of God that that's my heart's desire I want it all there now notice with this gift of faith under the wisdom of God I want you just to catch this just for a moment of God's wisdom remember wisdom being uh the best gift of all and the wisdom of God in this hour coming down through the ministry of Malachi 4 to put these in perspective or into their place brother bram's going to pick up on this Bulldog faith that he just spoke about because remember when you talk about that Bulldog faith that or Roberts had uh Jack Cole and and you know and how that those men were so gifted within that way you know what they would be ministering and preaching you were not going to go to their services and hear Doctrine so much being ministered but what you were going to hear is is ministering on Divine Healing those that that's where a Allen all the rest of them that that's where they were focused around even within that time so they would be preaching the principles and the promises of God listen friends let me just say it to you like this the the principles and Promises of God are not exclusive to the bride that of the Rapture of the token of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal that's bride exclusive are you hearing me that that's not that's not to all that's bride exclusive it's a word that gets down and discerns and leads us into full relationship right so then with this this we understand with this wisdom of God that God would would send down brother BR says this now watch he says Oral Roberts has the gift of healing I do I do have a gift of healing like you ministers to bring the people up there and pray for them but that's just a faith that just Bulldog faith that takes a hold and things like that but sometimes you let things go by but this way it's prophetic gift that searches that soul now what brother R is dealing with sometimes you let things go by because he said that with a Faith remember brother R say it over and over he said gifts themselves people can get themselves in trouble with gifts this is why that with that of faith that you say brother Samuel could a person's Faith be built to a place and there be things even wrong in their life it could be by the atmosphere they're around the prophet tells us that what place in New York where when you had those that were coming around and coming through the prayer line blind eyes were healed ears were ears were open and they walked off the platform and within a day or two they were blind again deaf again and the prophet said what happened was in the presence of the Angel of the Lord it took it off but because they weren't sincere down in the bottom of their heart having hiding things and unconfessed sin it came right back why it was an invitation for that Spirit to return right this is why the prophet said the Lord the angel of the Lord instructed him you make those people repent before they come up there you see friends let me just tell you something it the greatest thing uh in our lives that is the greatest blessing in our lives yes we're going to be times we need healing but you know what a blessing it is to be able to live free and clear where there's nothing you've got to try to bury in the backyard or hide or keep away you know it don't do no good you might hide from me you might hide from anybody else but let me just tell you something there's an all C and I that's watching you and the word itself is alive it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and when the word comes to deal with our lives he's not here to shame us that pullback sometimes is because the enemy is getting exposed because of the hold that he might have in our life but God is wanting to cut us free because we are people real true son of Liberty we are those that were ordained by the blood of Jesus Christ because the purchase has already been made we we should not be held down and subject to anything and this is why the wings of Jehovah Eagle sweeps over the congregation and ministers to our life to let us know you're free amen you're free all it simply takes is a confession and that'll back the devil right up amen Hallelujah this is what brother B is talking about he said what if they came up there and I through prayer and Faith take that sickness off of them or that disease that God allowed to be put on them for correction that I'm in trouble he said I'm in trouble you see what wisdom did with the gift of faith it brought the intelligence of God down it brings the wisdom of God about these things not just walking out and saying well I'm going to do this and I'll do this and no no remember Faith fa gift of faith is get yourself out of the way it's not about what we want to do so then you know brother Bram said you know there's all these things you know he talking about that super duper faith and he says you know remember I talked to you about the angel of the Lord taking things off of people and brother B says you know these men he said sometimes he's talking about men with gift of faith and things he said God doesn't have no such things as that no super duper healing super duper faith super you know what that is that's billboard attraction God has never been inter I'll tell you what God won't share his glory with no man a man starts to get lifted up a little bit that's it it's on the way out the door God will move on it doesn't mean that that man or that individual is lost but you know what God can only use us as we are available to be used and so he said God don't have no such things as that they bring people to the platforms many times and gifted men no doubt but with a misunderstanding of the Gospel they'll P oil on them pray stand there shake them until something happens and they get healed and maybe that person living in sin and go right back out and find it comes right back on them again and maybe they was under an excitement at that time you hear what he said maybe they was under an excitement at that time and and with which the faith of God that they accumulated did heal them but when they get off among unbelievers it comes right back again so you see this why you know because you see how Satan's trick with this if he can keep things hidden and that things aren't really clear wherein that the blessings of God will be retained in our life by real clear Faith then Satan will turn around to an individual and say see there ain't nothing to you you must not be a believer look at you oh by the way you know brother Brandon says this an adoption part too if you've got something in your life you can't rest until you make it right right away and what is this two weeks month down the road and you're still hanging on you got to watch Satan is working to try to run things down and run you right in the ground but this is where faith on the inside will not take no for an answer because what you cannot deny you cannot deny what God has done in your life and let me tell you something no more than a Roman seal could keep him locked in a tomb no more than any form of UN believe or anything is going to take the holy spirit away from your life you can grieve it but remember very simple for it to return become a lamb again amen become a lamb amen so when we look at this Gifts of healing and brother bam said it's not gift of healing it's gifts plural he said because it's God working in a many many many many uh not a Min membered but a many faceted way a different ways he said God will work through the preacher to build your faith he said God might just move upon your neighbor sitting next to you God can move upon this one he said this is why it's Gifts of healing it's not just something that's confined it's God operating through the body in many different ways so here the scripture said to another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit brother BR says a gift of healing it's not a gift of Miracles though many miracles are performed right along with it but it's a gift of healing the people get well they go out prayed for they come back and they're healed wait till I leave the city friends after I'm gone a long time you'll hear the people coming to your churches saying Cancer's gone my deafness I had I hear now my Affliction it just left me and he goes on he says the gift of healing which is not a gift of Miracles it's a gift of healing now can God move down and miraculously right then and there absolutely brother BR said I've prayed for him and seen the cancers right there turn red black and fall off right on the platform but he said then you have that where it it can come and it'll speak directly to the life and it speaks to the life to curse the life remember what Jesus did when he saw that tree with leaves and he cursed he cursed that tree no man eat fruit from thee any longer he spoke to the life and the Bible said it dried from The Roots up and this is why there's the difference within that of Miracles and Divine Healing is there miracles in Divine Healing yes but Miracles are things listen it's all miraculous but I think you understand when we talk about miracles talking about things taking place right then and there but Divine Healing is where the Cure itself has come down into our life and it begins to move in our life just exactly like that one who returned back to the you know turned back there in home uh there in Canaan and his servants met him and he said hey hey hey hey you're you're the one that you the one that was sick he he's well and he asked him what hour did he begin to amend healing healing is a wonderful thing and let me just say this in this way it's not it's not it's all God's sovereignty as to how it all takes place that that in itself is one thing that should really you know just just put everything there at rest because it's just simply the faith in God that has been built and however it's going to take place when it drops in our heart hands are laid on or you know whatever it's going to take place whether it's a miracle right then or a miracle down the line it's all going to be of God is that right now notice brother BR says when these sick people pass by remember they'll get well you just go believe and if you come by your faith notice your faith will reach in and take a hold of that gift of healing and you'll be healed now notice when he says it'll reach in and take a hold of that gift of healing what is it it will take a hold of that faith in the finished work of God and bring it right down personal that it was he bore those stripes for me amen it's where it becomes personal oh my hallelujah oh man I just I can't wait till I get on down some of the other slides brother BR says a gift of healing doesn't mean that man heals somebody right it means a man that's got faith in Divine Healing that can point them to the finished work of Jesus Christ at Calvary so it isn't the man oh this this man's A Healer no that's that's not true it's not true at all it's not the man himself it's not anything of that of the man it means a man that has faith in Divine Healing now brother BR would talk about that you know even you know as he would uh deal with this and he would speak about how that you remember Tommy Osborne came running up to brother brandham after he saw that Maniac you know pin you know brother bram's feet into the ground and you know he he Tommy Osborne came running to brother Bram you know he came down there to his house and and he came down to and he said you know I I you know I want you to pray you know do you thinkk God that I'll have a gift of healing and and and so forth do you do you think I'll do that brother Bram tells him he said now Tommy he said you got to get started off on the right right foot because you can make a lot of noise and anything and people will follow you but remember your ministry said you're going to answer for it someday now he says he said you see that old oak tree sitting up there on the porch he said brother Bosworth I was standing right there on in front of that house down there where brother Bosworth sat and brother Bram had that little shotgun house and brother brother Bosworth you know he says you you go crawl up under that oak tree who knows about Divine Healing crawl up under that oak tree and talk to him a while he said now if you've been called with a gift you'd have known about it way back Yonder he said now he said now look Tomy he said every preacher general orders are to pray for the sick and he says it like this every Christian in here has just as much right to pray for the sick as I do he said now the only thing to do is preach the word so clear that you'd see it and accept it and there's nothing in the man that would he nothing in his prayer that would heal it's your faith brother Brown says now he said Tommy went up there and got with brother Bosworth I want you this will be important as I'm coming down he got with brother Bosworth and stayed with him about a year or so he said and and until he found all the techniques of how to use the scriptures if you ever read the book uh brother Bram the one he talked about remember he said said he was in that self-pity complex of that and he said until I heard the eagle scream when I read a book by FF Bosworth called healing thoughts you can buy it on Amazon for5 or $6 healing thoughts because when you go to reading it you'll be like I heard brother Ram say this I heard brother Ram say this and I heard brother Ram say this I heard you you'll be hearing quotes and things about confession because what one thing that brother Bosworth stood upon is is he said once we have been prayed for then begin to fill your life with every promise of God when you've been prayed for healing feel your life continually day by day sat at it with the promises of God confessing it meditating on it sounds like a multitude of quotes don't it it's true it's true yeah Thou shalt make thy way good and prosperous but you see building faith by the word of God now notice this gifts the gifts of faith and and we when we're looking at it here and noticing it that you know it's it's seeing in the word where brother Bram says if if you want to know how to get healed now you know when brother Bram speak in this KN and wanting how to get healed if someone would say there's somebody in town that's got a gift of healing now that doesn't mean that that person by this gift of healing can heal you it only means if you have faith in healing and from knowing it by the word of God because healing has already been appropriated amen he was already his stripes he already bore them I don't care what virus whatever more comes out of whatever lab or whatever anything I don't care the Bible said I'm the Lord that Health all Hallelujah and when fear wants to come around stick it right back in the devil's face I'm the Lord that Health all thine diseases hallelujah hallelujah all the way through the scriptures God has laid out his pring provision for healing in our lives I think that's so powerful because what brother bandam is is talking about in this quote is how that he says of that healing healing itself it's got to be based from the Bible and and it shows God's attitude is the same about healing it's the same all along now listen there's been vultures that wanted to come down in the evening time vultures that Abraham when that sacrifice was laid there those vultures wanted to come and pick away at the sacrifice but the prophet said Abraham stood up you know what I'm talking about Genesis 15 he shed away those vultures vultures that was wanting to take away Divine Healing was wanting to take away the reality of God out of the Church of the Living God I'm glad that there's Eagles of God that can run back the vultures and say you can't have one part of the body It All Belongs to Me amen amen and amen hallelujah he said I want to show you I want to show you how how that you know the appropriate praying and how you can get healed now this here it's all it's it's by divine inspiration it's by divine inspiration of how God would so work and to bring that our eyes would become open to the promise of God for what God has for us remember when Jesus sent the 12 disciples Judas was among them he gave them power and authority over all Devils this is for they ever had the Holy Ghost and to cure diseases now they themselves could not cure the diseases but they were under an administration of authority that had been granted to them even though the atonement had not come yet because healing has always been remember Judas was right in the midst of all this is that right remember brother Bram said Judas had a Ministry that was second to nine he sent now he sent and told them to preach the kingdom and to heal the sick and they departed and went through the towns preaching the go El and healing everywhere now you see all of that just like what I mentioned about Judas Satan likes to take things and try to throw off on it well I'll tell you what you know I've seen a lot of false you've heard this over and over you've heard preacher after preacher say it the reality of it is I I don't think anybody in here if you're offered a $100 bill are going to say nope i' I've got too many I've had too many phony if you've had even phony ones you've been blessed you understand but you see how the devil would he wants to try to minimize things and and through that of well I know Judas and I know this let me tell you something God's got true gifts because God's word is true amen and you be like that old groundhog that when he looked up there and brother BR said he saw that old sorry thing that I made for a scarecrow he looked at that and went right around behind and kept on eating butter beans sometimes you've got to walk past scarecrows amen and recognize how do I know it's a scarecrow if it's anything that tries to rise up and keep you from anything that God has promised it's a scarecrow now brother B says this in looking for Jesus you know what he's talking about how that within this of how that the the minister will begin to speak by inspiration and brother BR says he goes in he says now the minister he he gets ins spiration he's got a gift of healing gift of healing course is Faith in healing you can kind of see how faith and that Gifts of healing work he believes it with all his heart he stands up and he preaches it with great forceful words that goes out to the people and they just have to believe it it just presents it in such a way till you just have to believe it how many of you said in meetings like that sometimes some of our regular Services how God will take something but we've sat right here even when God will bring in evangelists or maybe it's another Pastor or you've been in another meeting and all of a sudden it just takes and takes a place in such a place like that that you're in a part to say you know what I'm not walking out of here with this in my life what's happened your faith is being built by the inspiration of God that has inspired that man and it's causing you to see beyond your condition and see it's already finished that's good that's good brother BR says now brother Roberts he's very good at that a brother brother Osborne a man who can tie Satan in so many places in the scripture till he hasn't even got a place to move he's just tied up he does that not by knowledge they do it by inspiration and the Holy Spirit give them a gift of Divine Healing which gives inspiration to the people when they see the word of God is claiming what they're talking about so it opens our eyes of understanding it begins to open within that moment what is that it is a gift one a gift of healing that can move right down remember Gifts of healing it can be in many manner brother BR says it'll come many times through maybe a master teacher though he said they're Master explainers of the word And he as I just read to you right here they can tie they can tie Satan in so many places and he wants to escape there and they tie him up right there brother R says in another place that man begins to let loose he says he Corners the devil all over the place what is that a gift of healing coming through the ministering of the word and then after that hands will be laid on committal how they feel led to do it sometimes it's with hands right sometimes it stand up hands laid on one another sometimes it stand it's just stand up it's over you just you just sense it it's over it's it's dropped now it may not have dropped for everybody maybe someone who needs help but you know what if I if I just need a little bit of reassurance I'm not ashamed brother Samuel you've been you've been serving the lord for how many years well I don't know that you got a badge to where you don't ever have to come forward for prayer I do know a badge called Pride I don't want that that you know well I just speak the word and just you know this is once again we don't want to allow the things to where the enemy puts us in a corner and we don't got to pretend to be nothing we are Sons and Daughters of God we've got a right to every promise of God how dare the vultures of the enemy minimize any promise of God we still believe in laying hands on the sick and they shall recover we believe there is the prayer of faith that'll back the devil up we believe that that the Holy Ghost is just is real you can receive it while the word's going forth they can lay hands on you and you receive it God is still the god of his word every word is just as inspired glory be to God that inspiration strikes let me tell you what's happening there when inspiration strikes you like that brother BR says confess he says when the inspiration of the holy spirit is there to inspire you you confess what he's saying you know what's happening it's like a temporary Rapture that's what happened to the prophets when they would get caught up and they would see things so clear this is what happens to you when the inspiration the channel of inspiration begins to build whether it's for healing it doesn't matter stepping into that channel of inspiration you begin to see things oh brother Braham said oh he said I've seen he said people sit there glum and everything else he said all of a sudden something he said will cut loose way up here and it'll start rolling down rolling down rolling down and he said it rolls down and it strikes that individual he said where they sat with a frown all of a sudden it becomes a smile he said they they just receive you know just like a strength and and ready to move on he said what is that that's Revelation dropping from The Unseen realm glory be to God do you realize the prophet said in Revelation book of symbols when you have been baptized with the Holy Ghost and become born again you have now become a candidate to have an association with the angels the supernatural almighty God hallah because remember bringing you and I messages those who are The Heirs of Salvation glory be to God hallelujah oh I'm glad GL I not only have a passport where we've got the Visa cuz you can have a passport and not get into a country that almost happened to me in Ghana the one time first time I went it was about a week and a half before I had to go and realized I had to have a right before I flew to Australia it wasn't some Visa it was some you know some some sort of thing I had to have I didn't realize it all of a sudden I realized I text brother Nathan text Brother Ronnie said Hey cuz they had went there the year ahead of me I said hey do I got to get to have anything else now it reminds you I'm only a few days from step on an airplane I thought dear Lord here I've done it again I mean who would have thought you know I didn't need a visa to go into the Philippines but you see what happened is is that I needed to have that Visa along with the passport because you know what the Visa is it's your token the passport is believing on him but the Visa comes from being in him that's not my words that's the prophet's words you've got to have that Visa which is the token God helped me to always be sensitive to that cuz the Lord knows I could have showed up over there and they could have just been interrogating me for a long time but you see the gifts of healing what it is its faith is Rising by seeing it through the word of God and brother B is talking about how that he says you know a man can preach the word of God so simple that a child could understand it and the people say well that's right then he's cornering the devil and the first thing you know the person says oh I believe it oh I believe it's from me and they accept it that settles it they go on testifying of it and they get well brother B say now some people has gifts like a real good preacher he can take that word of God lay it out there like some good Theologian that's the gift of healing they can make you see it through the word but it isn't the man cuz we can say here and talk all the time it isn't the man oh he has such an ability to be able to explain everything what did he say I don't know but I know it was deep right that's not what we're talking about that that's not what listen even with all the doctrines what's been restored to us was not to make us ooh and a and oh that's so deep did you see how that chart was laid out I'm not against charts I'm not against things being drawn out but you know what it's got to come down to where it'll walk in shoe leather we can't just look at the horse riders out here and say oh that's an antichrist Spirit oh I see the next one coming in and want to take power and then I see the next one coming in death then I see that next one just a mixture of everything just letting all down it's not just staying out there in Doctrine it's got to come down to discern it how it wants to make a ride in our own lives how he wants to ride right through the Bride of Jesus Christ he would love to come in such a simple way and when he gets in through a simple way then it begins to take power then death sets in we become deadened and the result of deadening is where we become mixture becomes pale grizzled oh my this is why we need the Discerning of the Holy Spirit notice the scripture would tell us here I'm I'm trying to get down brother Bram you know he would take that in the scripture of how that where it says it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching the Lord Jesus there the Pharisees and doctors of the law were sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them now let me just try to bring this down here tonight we'll just kind of pause here brother brandham he steps forward and he is going to preach on he's been dealing with the Hebrew series and he wants to he's going to preach that morning on mzc great king and and priest Prince and he comes he's ready to go brother Bram tells us he's ready to go in the back office and he starts Hearing in the back office all these requests this one's sick this one's sick this one's sick oh there's one here with a baby that's sick brother BR said I just begin to hear all of these requests for different ones for healing and he said says after hearing these and requests for prayer I thought I'd just change it now where did he get the prompt to change it because at the end of this quote I'm referring to he said see I just had to be submissive to the Holy Spirit has he changed it for the purpose of what the needs that were present for healing and the spirit of God would so take the prophet of God and begin to minister on that of Divine Healing the promises of God aren't you glad that God ministers right to what we have need of he ministers to WR where we have need of as a matter of fact brother bam goes on to tell us within things of how that even when it would come like he would talk about with brother Bosworth you know brother Bosworth when you you ever listen to brother Bosworth you know because you would think you know like when you when you hear uh brother Oral Roberts brother Jack Cole if you ever hear them there's YouTube videos on them and uh and ministering and you'd hear them like brother Ram said they're forceful guys but when you would with brother FF Bosworth brother Bram would talk about how he said he was a teacher he said he you know he may not be able to preach like Paul but his his Focus was to try to catch the heart of the people and so brother brother Bosworth he says now maybe while somebody else he's comparing he said now maybe while somebody else is given a forceful message setting way back in the room and someone's enjoying that but there's a poor man dying with cancer and he don't care about a forceful message he wants to know some way out of the trouble that's good he's in that's good but's not knocking a forceful message he's just if one thing of all if we can draw out of this it's not about how much the minister sweats it's not how much they move it isn't even how much if they stand cuz most of Jesus preaching he was sitting that's right so this is why brother Bram says it shows us he said I really don't think we know what anointing is he said anointing is knowing how and when so good that's what a real anointing is so what what is that of real anointing is to wear that it would come upon the word and our eyes begin to see that finished work for whatever it is we have need of whether it's healing Deliverance whether whe it's the Holy Ghost whatever it is that you have need of it's that God would so appropriate what is needed the Lord anoint my eyes anoint my eyes of faith that I can see it's finished it's finished whether I receive the results right now or not just a word from you and when I've received that word from you that's a revelation and the gates of hell can Prevail against him do you love him amen amen I just so appreciate the Lord now let me just let me just give you this one little one little thing right here let me just give you one one little one little token before you leave I told you I was going to quit and I am I just want to give you one little token here brother Bram is talking about this with Divine Healing and he says you know what you don't have to wait till a Divine Healing program comes to be healed as a matter of fact he said they ought to be a Divine Healing campaign in every church and he said God will move through any member of the body he said it's not restricted to ministers God can move right through a lay member brother B gives an example I'll read it to you next week of where his daughter three years old little Rebecca three years old she got a burden on her heart in seeing a certain need and she prayed for that need and God moved down and honored the faith and that individual was healed you see three-year-old individual it didn't take somebody who was great enough it just takes simple childlike Faith amen you love the Lord that's so good this is why sitting right here tonight I might be out of town you may not even be able to reach me but listen your hands is just as good as my hands your prayers is just as good is that right they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover maybe you a't got nobody else around maybe you you'll call somebody else on the phone maybe there's been times where you just have to lay hands on yourself that's that's good you and many others that's done that they said and it says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover these might be a part of this body but right now when I'm laying them on they are in commandment and authority to the general orders of the Church of the Living God blessed be the name of the Lord you love him tonight amen let's just stand amen oh my Hallelujah I wonder if we just couldn't have prayer tonight maybe they just pray play something softly let's just have prayer I know there's many needs that's already been spoken request different needs of of healing also remember
