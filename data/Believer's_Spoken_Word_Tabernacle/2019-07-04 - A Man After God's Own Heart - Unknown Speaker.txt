TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a man turns me to acts chapter 13 when I read verses 21 through 23 and afterward they desired a king and God gave it to them saw the son of sis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all of my will of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a saviour jesus may be seated what I want to Minister on tonight is a man after God's own heart we find where we start there in the scriptures and first Samuel did that saw what it took place Saul was actually only in his second year of reign eNOS King oneness took place and he the Philistines had come and were gathering against them and Saul was waiting on Samuel to come to offer up supplications into the Lord offer a sacrifice before he went into battle against the Philistines and while he was waiting samuel delayed from coming and the Philistines were moving and gathering themselves and Saul became worried and so Saul decided that he would give the sacrifice to God himself and so he made the sacrifice ordered it to be brought to him made the sacrifice offered unto God and the Bible says as soon as he was finished that Samuel came and Samuel asked him what have you done and so Saul right away begins to say well you know this and that I the Philistines were gathered against me the people were scattering from me I was waiting on you and you didn't come and so I forced myself to give this sacrifice because I was afraid the Philistines would come and fall upon us before I give my supplications unto the Lord and Samuel said you've done a foolish thing you have disobeyed the commandments of God see Saul got out of his place it's always anointed to be king but Saul got out of his place and offered up a sacrifice as a minister something we ought to always be aware of and never get out of our place with God amen and so then Samuel says to him your king God would have that your kingdom continue on down through your sons and sons sons and so forth he said but now it's not going to continue because of what you've done because you couldn't keep the commandment and God has sought him out a person a man after his own heart and of course we know that in Acts it speaks of it says David was this man and you know we look at David we look at all his faults we look at his failures we look at his mistakes we look at his sin and we wonder how that in the book of Acts God could still call him a man after his own heart but we'd have to look at David's characteristics Paul is actually riding here in the book of Acts how telling you how God feels about David this is how God felt about here's the thing how God feels about you has nothing to do with how perfect you can be because there's none of us perfect how God feels about you has nothing to do with your mistakes your failures your shortcomings that doesn't affect how God feels about you as the natural father my sons may make mistakes my daughters but I doesn't change my love for them it doesn't remove them from being my sons and daughters and that's the way it is with God with his sons and daughters it doesn't remove you from being his son or his daughter it doesn't there's nothing you can do to make God love you more than he already does and there's nothing you can do to make him love you less God loves you unconditionally but how could God still call him a man after his own heart we find this in the verse that we read there where it says he was a man after his heart that he's going to do everything I want him to do David would do all that the Lord wanted anything God asked of him David did unlike Saul so didn't always do everything the Lord asked of me David was far from perfect in this scriptures David opens up his life for examination by all he doesn't hold back he doesn't hold back from you his is crying unto the Lord he doesn't hold back from you his repentance unto God he David's heart was pointed toward God he had a deep desire in his heart for God he loved the Lord with all his heart one of the characteristics of David was his absolute faith this is we can see this when Goliath the great Philistine came against Israel and David just a young lad goes up says who is this uncircumcised Philistine to defy the armies of the Living God and you know Goliath was saying let's one of your champions come out and fight me and whoever wins were then that'll be the Conqueror they said I'll go fight him you imagine how ridiculous that looked to all the men around him the men were afraid to go out and fight this this gigantic man but David said I'll go do it David had faith and he says just as God delivered me out of the pall of the bear and the fall of the line he'll deliver me out of the hands of this Philistine he had absolute faith David knew that God was in control of his life when we can get to a place where we realize that God is in control of our life we'll quit worrying and fretting over things will cook worrying and fretting over our children will quit worrying and fretting over our own lines why because we know that we are in God's hand he's got it all in control if God can't do it we sure can if God can't accomplish it you're not going to be able to were dependent on him and David was utterly dependent upon the Lord here he he had no military experience he had no fighting experience but he had experience with one thing and that was trusting God and he had this little sling and had these stones you know I believe that David knew that one of them stones was ordained to strike that giant in just the right place because I don't care how good you are with the sling or how good even you are with the rifle you know they didn't have rifles back then but David to be able to hit that giant exactly where he needed to hit him with the exact amount of force that needed to in order to actually kill that giant that was God in wouldn't no matter if David would have turned and throwed the stone the other way it has still hit the giant took him down [Applause] David's faith pleased God he was pleased with David's faith and he reward David for his faithfulness David was faithful to the Lord another one of David's character it says he'd loved God's Word he loved the Word of God there's 150 songs over half of them somewhere between 73 and then they say that in the New Testament it gives him credit for two more so about 75 of the songs were wrote by David he loved absolutely loved the Word of God and he repeatedly mentions how that he'd love God's Word Psalms 119 47 48 David writes I will delight myself in thy commandments which I have loved my hands also will I lift up into thy commandments which I have loved and I will meditate in thy statute you can see his complete adoration for God's Word he simply adored also the scripture says here that we read david meditated on the word he meditated on God statue he thought on gods were you know it's not just important to read God's Word but God likes us to meditate on his word to think about his word I when I'm studying for a message why after I've put notes together in things I'll get off to myself and I'll just sit there and I tell my wife I'm studying in my mind but what I'm doing is I'm meditating on everything I've studied I'm meditating on the Word of God for God to direct me to put in me what's not in the notes lest are they that keep his testimonies and day.this seek him of the whole heart David says another one of Davis characteristics was he was grateful he was always thankful unto the Lord he had a heart of gratitude toward God I I don't know if you've ever had any experience with people who have no gratitude at all but it doesn't matter what you do for them they're never grateful I've had that experience firsthand but David was grateful for all that God did for him and David through all the seasons of his life David never failed to give thanks to God for everything that he had it didn't matter if he was up or he was down look he was giving God praise he was giving God thanks they was life is marked by peace prosperity also marked by fear and despair but he always gave God things he says in Psalms 1 of 104 enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto Him and bless his name we ought to follow David's lien be able to give praise unto God give praise to him in the song give praise to him with our hands amen give praise to him with the shout a man give praise to God with the dance a man we ought to be able to give praise with job with every fiber of our being hallelujah the other characteristics of David was he was truly repentant whenever his sin was found out David was truly repentant David never offered an excuse for why he did what he did David never blamed it on anybody else he always took the blame it didn't even matter if the blame was shared David still just took it himself in the case of him and Bathsheba brother branham says in one place fast she even knew that the king walked up on the roof that time of the evening so did she have some blame in this yes but David never even mentions it David takes the blame in himself he said I have sinned so that's one of David's great things about David David was willing to admit his transgressions he was willing to admit his sin even when saul was faced with by Samuel with what he'd done and that was wrong Saul still would not admit that he'd done something wrong and he always had an excuse and Saul didn't repent the only thing saw felt sorry for was the fact that Samuel said God's taken the kingdom from you but look at look at David you know we read by that in it when you read in First Samuel chapter 13 you find out that when Saul did what we were talking about earlier offered this sacrificing that he was only in the second year of his reign and God said I have sought me out a man after my own heart then we find a few chapters a little bit later on is where Saul was supposed to to go and to kill your Melek Ines and he refused to do it he didn't do all that God had asked him he didn't actually utterly refused but he didn't do all God told him to do and whenever Samuel confronted him Saul always had an excuse well Samuel you know you didn't come and I was waiting on you and the Philistines are gonna be upon me and I hadn't had a sacrifice and and so I forced myself and then when Sall is told by Samuel that God has taken the kingdom from you he's giving it unto your neighbor a man that's better than yourself then Samuel turned to go and saw reached out and grabbed his robe and rent his role and and Samuel looks and says this day as he rent the kingdom from your hands see that was the only thing Saul was sorry about now somewhere along the way Saul had to repent he had to get right but that was not ever his first reaction we ought to think about that don't don't try to give excuse for when we've done something that we shouldn't have done see okay yeah I did it but it's not just enough to emit your skin that's only half of the equation you've got to repent of it David had a repented heart Psalms 51 Psalms 51 says this is David who is writing this Psalm after Nathan had come to him and after he had been with Bathsheba and his sin was before him and he says have mercy upon me O God according to thy loving-kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin Brian ology my transgressions and my sin is ever before we verse 7 purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sin blot out all mine iniquities creating me a clean heart O God renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from that presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from blood-guiltiness O God thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness o Lord open down my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else I would give it now light is not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a broken and contrite heart O God that will not despise David had a soul that could be touched by the truth he was unafraid to admit we had done wrong and we can see here the tenderness of his spirit David had a tender heart toward the Lord to see another quality of David we'll go back to what I was saying earlier Saul was only in the second year of his reign when he offered this sacrifice and then we find the book of accident says he reigned 40 year so that was 38 more years from the time that that God spoke through Samuel and said I've sought me out a man after my own heart 38 years later before God ever placed David in that position david was anointed a few chapters later on David was anointed but still was many years passed and we could see David's respect for the office that saw hell David many times had opportunity to slay Saul and Saul had definitely become the enemy of David because he counted David his enemy Saul feared David because he saw the Blessed hand of Almighty God rested upon him David even when Saul was delivered into his hands they even felt bad that he even cuts all skirt but he done that to show Saul you were in my hand and I didn't take your life I am NOT your enemy didn't change souls how was it gon hit though want a character what character David when Nathan came to David and told David of what I remember he tells him a little parable and David from that says that man shall restore back what he's taken and David actually ordered his death David in doing so was actually ordering his own death you realized what David done David committed adultery David committed murder according to the law David should have been stoned but God looked on David's heart and he saw the desire of David's heart was a desire for God and God extended grace to David remember when David said I've sinned and Nathan said God's not going to kill you God has removed your sin David said hide my sin from your faith so God brother branham said grace is solver it's game by a sovereign one and he says grace doesn't have to ask permission for what it does I'm thankful for that when God extended his grace to me he didn't have to come down and ask a bunch of church members is that okay because there might have been some back in my life that wouldn't have said yeah that's okay I know you might find this hard to believe but I wasn't liked by everybody but God didn't ask anybody God just God didn't ask anybody when he touched your life God just did it and he didn't do it because you merited it he didn't do it because he looked down and said Maya this is just a wonderful person why they're so perfect my goodness I don't know how I've overlooked them up to this point no it's on Christ's merits that God extends grace to us but here in the Old Testament God extended grace to David David didn't get by even though God said he was a man after my own heart David didn't get by David still had to come and face the consequences of the things he done he says he'll not kill you David but the child will not live David cried before the Lord would not eat would not get up stayed laying down crying for the for the life of that child God had already spoken after they come and told David the child is dead David got up washed himself off then went down to eat remember they asked him a question said why he says before maybe perhaps God might have moved on behalf of the child he said but now he's gone on to be with God there's no there's no need for me now to the beg gonna ask God sovereign grace brother Bentham said that was proved that the cross were the vilest thief he deserved to die God had never come across his mind he had never thought nothing of it but there on the cross through those bloodied lips in between the groans came a sound Lord be merciful to me remember me when you come into your kingdom it showed that he believed there were those around that were mocking him even the other thief began to mock him and said if you're truly that Christ and save yourself and save us too which the other thief rebuked him for he said remember me when you come into your kingdom showing he believed who Jesus was that he was indeed a team that he was indeed king of Israel he said remember me and he knew that it wasn't this natural kingdom he said remember me when you come into your kingdom and God showed grace to that thief couldn't help himself no more than Adam could help himself no more than Eve could help herself no more than you or I could help ourselves no more than you and I could reach down and pull ourselves up through the great Milky Way by our own bootstraps but grace grace can do something about it we can't do for ourselves but grace can and here's the thing it does hallelujah this day thou shalt be with me in paradise amen twice God mentions that David is a man after his own heart he was one of God's favor even though he's sinned even though he comes short but God looked on his heart now there's a thing today that I've heard a lot of people say God don't look on the outside he looks at the heart and that's true however they're using it for an excuse because their outside isn't matching the word but if the insides right the outside is going to come into subjection to what's on the inside the outside will match the word amen the the the what the outside displays what's in the heart and David's heart was after God and David displayed this in in his writings it is praised in his songs in his music David worshiped God he loved the word he had great faith and he had a repentant heart David was a poet a musician a prophet Israel's greatest King one of the greatest military leaders ever but it was his character and the fact that he had a repentant heart was way more important than any of those other thing david says in the songs the Lord confides in those that fear him to think that God would confide in a human being that's amazing but God chose to share his heart with me he chose to confide in him David said the secret of the Lord is with them that fear God confided in David it shows and speaks something of David's character David was committed to following God he demonstrated his faith david's faith was tested on a grand scale and there was times he fell but after his sin he always sought forgiveness you saw it and receive God's forgiveness when we think of David's legacy there are those that that may be critical could be but you should remember how Israel thought of date we're familiar with the expressions the City of David the seed of David the throne of David the house of David and you know something that to me was a great commentary of David was when the Lord Jesus identified himself as being the son of me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm sure that all of us would like to be a person after God's own heart we would like for God to think of us in that that way when these are the characteristics you need absolutely trust God believe him no matter what the circumstances look like no matter how impossible they may see you know there are times when things seem to be headed a certain direction the opposite direction of the way that you want them to be the opposite of good but you've got to remember that the Bible says all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord that are called according to his purpose all things not just some things but all things even the things that look like they're not going to be for your good work for your good love the Lord and love his word with all your heart want to keep this work want to read his word want to be intimate with God be ever thankful you God giving him praise always even when we don't feel like there's times maybe you're going through things during the week and you come into the service and maybe humanly you really don't feel like raising your hand you really don't feel like clapping your hand you really don't feel like getting into the service sometimes they I don't really feel like sing maybe you've never felt that but I can tell you I've witnessed that feeling myself and I've witnessed others having that feeling I was a song leader before I started preaching all the poor song leaders remember one time song leader down a Dixon you know somebody told him after service said that was a wonderful special you son he said it wasn't meant to be his special have a repented heart David said the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart O God thou will not despise your contract means means showing sorrow and remorse percent showing sorrow and remorse now there's a lot of people that are getting a situation and they'll be sorry they got in the situation but they don't have any remorse for what they did to get him in that situation I have spent times going to court with different individuals that's had to go and and some of them were guilty and I still went with them asking God to have mercy but I've watched time after time individuals get up and it's never their fault they robbed the store but it wasn't their fault one young men robbed a chicken place and the reason they caught him and knew he was the one was because she still had the crowbar with but it wasn't his fault that's that's the way this generation is today nothing's ever their fault it's always somebody else's they never take responsibility for their own actions that's the world today but David always took responsibility for his action yes he begged for mercy but he still took responsibility for his own action you never hear David when there was trouble that faced his family when the you know the God said the swords never going to depart from your family David had problems he had his own son stand up against him try to take the kingdom from me one of his sons raped one of the sister Davida there was many problems but you never hear david saying why God why why me I've heard people say that YNAB happen to me like it'd have been better if it happened to somebody else why'd it have to happen this way why am I going through this I've heard people say doesn't God love me yes God loves you that's why he's allowing you to go through those tests those times those trials those situations because he want look we go through situations that actually brings us to trusting God we go through things that increases our faith we face sicknesses sometime and it requires faith on our part to think about this is gonna require faith to go in the rapture if we can't have faith for the little things how we're going to have faith to go on the rapture to have faith to where when the doctors have gave up but you've still got faith in confidence of God to go before God and ask him to do something about it [Applause] not well the doctors have give them up I guess we better be finding them something to wear at their funeral no bud go before God and say I don't care what the doctor but God I know you're able that's the thing and we you know we always want to seek for God's will in everything I've had people come up to me prayed for that they wouldn't have to go through a certain surgery I said but what if it's God's will for you to go through that surgery what if through that that God's gonna work something in your life I know he's a God of miracles I know that God come before my miracle and a person wouldn't have to go through surgery I have witnessed we've got doing that very thing but there are times when God has you go through it for your own benefit I've had people come and ask me that they wouldn't have to go through surgery because they were afraid of anesthesia I've never understood that I've never been afraid of anesthesia whenever I went in for surgery I'm like hurry up put me out I wouldn't be surgeon one time and a young fella came in there he was just learning you know and he said they're not gonna put you to sleep and I said what but I got in with the chief anesthesiologist I said you are putting me to sleep right because I don't want to be awakened during this that's some good sleep you never you don't even dream there's some people that are afraid of it well what if I don't wake up well I guess you'll be in glory [Applause] what's the fear don't fear death my mom don't fear death for herself she fears it from here boy sometime if it was up to her she wouldn't want us to go on any of these mission trips but I'm not afraid to go because if I feel let have got to go I know God's gonna take care of me if it comes my time to go wouldn't matter if I was here in the United States I'm gonna go when it comes your time to go you're going nothing's gonna stop that and if it's not your time to go I heard one time just forgive me I'm not saying this to be funny but I'm saying this to make a point I heard one time where a person said you know they were on a plane and they said the Ellen City you can't go until it's your time to go and he said what happens if it's the pilot it's time to go and you know I read a story true story about a woman who was on a plane and the plane was going over South America and the plane utterly disintegrates plane just came apart and she was strapped into her seat and the plane became apart everybody else on the plane died somehow her seat fell got caught in a tree and she lived she was out in the jungle she was out in a very dangerous place but the only thing she think of was follow the river I've instantly come to something and she followed it till she come to a community and then she was saved so if it ain't your time to go not even a plane crash can take you when I read that story I said well it definitely wasn't her time because all the all the the ingredients to dyes were there for her but it wasn't her time so there's nothing can take you before your time you know brother Jack Cole there were those that said after he died they said he got out of God's will and that's why God had to take him and the prophet of God stuck up for him he says it's not true he said God doesn't take anybody until they've served the purpose he put him here for and he said when brother Jack cold serve God's purpose then God took him but you know there were great critics of him because of the way he died of the disease he died of you know and here he was supposed to be a faith healer you got to go some way broken and contrite heart you know I've had the experience in my life no happened to repent for God and asking God begging God had God forgive me I'm sorry I never meant to do forgive me for making excuses God sometimes we'll do something we'll make an excuse for why we're going to do it like that'll make it okay God forgive me truly sorrow and remorse for sin I want to be a person after God's own heart when I come down to the end I want God to say well done my good and faithful servant you've been faithful in a few things I'll make you ruler over many I only have a few things but I want to be faith faithful to the war I want God to look down on me and smile I'm sure he did I know I can't live without the mercy and grace of God I want you know we want God's grace in our lives we want God's blessing we want God's blessings on every part of our life I've been blessed with a wonderful marriage my wife the thing is services streaming my wife was watching the service tonight and I told her I would say hi and you know I've got a wonderful wife she prays for me gracefully when I'm in the services when I'm out preaching I know I had only always count on her be praying for me when I go on the mission field there she is left back at home though she doesn't want to be without me she never says anything about my going she sacrifices it's one of her sacrifices to God one of these days I'll convince her to go on a trip with me you know when brother branham said when God calls a man he calls the wife also well I've said she's not call to go to mission fields I want to be pleasing to the Lord don't you I want God to look on me as a man after his own heart we must stand Heavenly Father we thank you tonight where your word Lord for your encouragement they're gone the God even after David Backes lid you still
