the reading of your word today Lord there are needs here present today there was needs in the wilderness but there are needs here today and we're a needy people but you're a mighty God you're a mighty savior you're mighty to save your arm is not waxed short that you cannot save which are the same God today the darkness of laodicea and the Darkness of this world it's no match for the the light of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ greater is he greater are you today in our midst in our hearts in our lives you're greater than the powers of Darkness than he that's in the world Lord we give you praise and glory now pray you bless this word bless the ministering thereof maybe to your great praise and glory and honor for you deserve it all Lord we love you we thank you for victory in the love divine we commit this time our lives our hearts into your hands in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the bride says amen God bless you very very good to be with you today I'm just uh I'm very privileged you can be seated for just a moment if you'd like um we just are very privileged to be with you I know I had some people ask me already so I thought I would just take a few moments and give a little testimony about what's been going on in my life and and uh and things um some of you may remember here clear back I think it was 2018 I ministered here and about a week or two later I went in I had real bad pneumonia I put off going to the doctor for about a month and about killed me so I've learned to try to be a little more uh careful about those things because you know sometimes in our lives and maybe this will help somebody too sometimes in our lives we think man I don't even have time to be sick we get so busy and it seems that way but you know what I didn't have time to be in the hospital for eight or nine days either so I I started having some issues here back uh back in June and I was just getting really kind of short of breath and I'd have pain in my left arm it would kind of come and go at first and then it would kind of not go so fast and then eventually my ears started had chest pain and so my blood pressure at one point was almost 180 over 100 it was really bad so uh you know I I went and got checked out and to make a long story short they went and did a heart catheterization and my main my main arter was 99.99 I don't you know I'm not a mathematician I guess but it was completely blocked they showed me a little video they're like see see this line here and how it just kind of stops I'm like yeah it's not supposed to do that they said wow so they put a stent in there my the second one was 70 block so um you know it's interesting to me because uh um you know I can be kind of stubborn sometimes I prefer perseverance because it's for the Lord but I'm the type of person you know and and this is just me I'm not saying this for everybody but uh you know I when I when I had that surgery a few years ago you know I was out preaching the next day and people were like man you're nuts but you know what I just I know what God's done my life and I know what he's called me to and uh uh you know I've tried to do other things I've tried to run from but I can't find myself doing anything else but preaching the gospel and this message and so I just had the last procedure this Monday and I'm happy to be here with you in defiance of the devil and Defiance of the world and everything that would try to beset me I'm here today and on behalf of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in whom we serve and I'm thankful there's times you know there was times I was in the Pulpit here about last month man I I was preaching man I thought my heart was gonna all sudden it just start hurting real bad never hurt that bad before and I thought well if I'm gonna die I guess I'll die preaching this message you know what what better way could I go out you know and there's that guy who just preached till he dropped dead well praise the Lord that's better than being a coward I guess and so you know not that you're coward to be sick and stay home I'm saying but for me I'm just like you know what I wouldn't let fear seize upon that moment I said I'm just going to preach anyhow and so we're here today and and listen that's my testimony but we all come through things we've all dealt with things and maybe it's not the same as mine maybe it's worse I don't know we're not we're not here today to compare but we are here today to remember that greater is he he can take you through it amen for by every medical account especially the way I get to preaching sometimes one of the nurses said I should play the lottery and I thought well I I I'm not really that type of person but it's a miracle you're alive and I thought that's exactly the truth it's been a miracle I've been alive for the last 16 years I should have died 16 years ago and so the Lord just seemed fit to keep me here and who am I to contend with the Lord and some of you are here today maybe you wish to go on and you know that's understandable Paul wanted to go on one time but Paul said you know it's needful for me to be here and I believe it's needful for each one of us to be here today God's got a purpose in it God's got a purpose in your life not just me the preacher God's got a purpose in each of your lives and you're here today for a reason and I want you to really just meditate on that as we Minister today because I don't want us to it's so easy to lose sight of that and I hope you don't have to have a brush with death to remember that our lives here are it's like a vapor but yet God can do things in our life that are so great and so beyond our own thinking that things that you could never imagine that you could do God can do in your life amen God bless you if you stand with me once more this morning we'll look into the book of Nehemiah we're gonna look at Nehemiah the fourth chapter um I like the book of Nehemiah some of you may surmise that based on the fact that my oldest son's name Nehemiah so I do like the book of name I like them all but I really like Nehemiah it's not something it's preached on a lot but I love nehemiah's stand for the word and it's so many of the things that the scripture has here and I invite you to read with me this morning in Nehemiah the fourth chapter we'll start in verses we'll start in verse 12. and I'll read down to verse 20 and I'll have you be seated Nehemiah chapter 4 verse 12 says this and it came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places when she shall return unto us they will be upon they will be upon you not for some context here before I read a little further they have begun to rebuild this wall and there's some there's some adversaries they don't want the wall rebuilt amen now the temple has already been restored the worship the word has a restoration but there's some homes around this message there's some homes around this world that need some restoration still amen there's some people that their lives need to be rebuilt around this Temple this worship and so they begin to rebuild this and they get worn by by these different Jews there's opposition has arisen and a lot of people would say well I guess there's no point in building the wall but the point of building the wall is because there's opposition in the first place amen praise the Lord verse 13 He says therefore set out in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows and I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord amen remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to not that we returned all of us to the wall everyone into his work and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spears the Shields and the bows and the habergens and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah they which build it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid it everyone with one of his hands brought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side and so builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me oh this is really interesting this guy this guy with a trumpet and I said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall far from one one far from another in what place therefore in other words because we're all spread out doing this work and what place is therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet Resort the thither unto us our God shall fight for us amen you believe that today and the Lord blessed the reading of his word you may be seated I'd like to take a thought this morning it's uh it's actually a series I started a couple other places it's the first part uh it's called the hero of a greater world the hero of a greater world and uh to to give you some context for this uh I was on a mission trip several years back here in India one of the trips I've taken over there I was staying in a certain place I I don't remember which one I think maybe it was Roger mundry but that's neither here nor there to most of us anyway but I was staying in this hotel and uh a lot of the hotels over there that have the restaurants built in nearby are in it because of the way that the infrastructure is there and so I got up one morning and I had gotten ready and getting ready to go to the service and they were going to take me to breakfast and so I'm out walking from the through the courtyard from where my room was to where I was taking the breakfast and I noticed there were several different pillars outside and they had busts they're just black busts of different people on top of each one and I saw you know this this famous British guy that was there during the time that the British had been there and they had several different people and I'm saying this for a reason now I'm going along and I see a bust of Abraham Lincoln the 16th president of the United States right there in the middle of India and I thought it was remarkable to me that here's Abraham Lincoln in the midst of India I didn't expect to see him there or a likeness of his I mean he wasn't there but uh didn't expect to see that there and so I asked the brother I said brother I'm just kind of curious why why is there this statue of Abraham Lincoln here and he began to tell me about the 16th president of the United States and how he grew he told me all these things I'm thinking man most of these kids nowadays don't even know this in America they don't know nothing about Abraham Lincoln but he was talking about how you know he fought and they ended slavery and American what a great man he was he was talking about he said here in India we consider him a hero I know that's amazing because like I said again a lot of people don't even know who he is nowadays but they they here I am staring at the 16th president United States and in the middle of the other side of the world and he was telling me what an inspiration his leadership and his vision his character to the people of India much more than maybe some Americans and so I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that to be whatever I mean you know nowadays A lot of them don't know who we declare our independence from or different things like that I mean they have no idea amen I mean they call certain people Hitler and they can't even tell you when Hitler was alive I mean it's just interesting how people they throw these labels out but here in India this man Abraham Lincoln is regarded as a hero to the people of India and so it got me to thinking what is it that makes a man or a woman what makes him a hero what what defines a person as a hero and brother Brown says many things in the message about heroism it's kind of interesting when you go back and he talks about it quite a bit and so you know I begin to think what is it makes somebody a hero and the first thing that come to my mind or maybe a lot of of us is is there courage or their bravery and that's certainly a part of it but history is replete with examples of of people that were Brave they were bold because they were just dumb they were just too foolish to recognize the danger and they blundered into something so it's not courage in and of itself because there's plenty of people they're courageous but they're they die as fools for vainglory or whatever it is and it's not just that a man or a woman has a certain kind of a talent because there's plenty of people in the world they they waste their talents they bury their talents they misuse their talents they're afraid to employ their talents it's not that a person's just famous or that their deeds are known because there's many people that are well known and they're they're not heroic at all and it's interesting because when you look at the the Eastern culture in India and China especially their idea of a hero it extends just beyond their their their their more afforded to but there's somebody Whose actions have changed the natural order of things in the world their designs and what they have done is change the way that we do things or the way we look at things or the way that things are carried out and I thought you know that's a that's a really good one they look at a social reformer or somebody as a hero and so I say all these things and I look at all these things and to me what really makes the distinction of someone as a hero is not just they have virtue but it's their uncommon virtue or moral fortitude amen because a person of of strong moral conviction they endure exceptional hazards because at least to them it's the ethical of the right thing to do amen so I want you to understand it's not just a person that endures danger they put themselves in danger they put themselves In Harm's Way because the purpose that they are trying to fulfill is greater and I'm saying this for a reason we live in an era of modern entertainment and we're constantly the people are trying to redefine what a hero is you've got some guy with these big muscles of course he's got you know thousands of dollars of trainers a week and he's in a movie and he's got super powers and he does Super things and he's a superhero but listen if if you're bulletproof and you stand in front of a gun that doesn't make you Brave hey man that doesn't show any sort of special virtue if you have super powers and you do super things with it that's not special as far as your character is concerned but a hero can be an ordinary person who knows that maybe even their life would be forfeit but they'll put themselves In Harm's Way they'll Hazard dangers that they choose to Hazard because for them the cause is greater than their own life amen should take somebody who maybe their abilities or whatever it's common but their character is so exceptional and it differs from anyone else and you notice it amen you know why is it when we're younger especially we're always looking up to different heroes in our lives we're looking at the the book of Hebrews and the the heroes of the faith as Christians we have so many God examples and why is it because when when a person is heroic when they take their stand it does something it inspires us and that's what makes it heroic when they put themselves in this condition and they they come through and people look at it it's an inspiration it rallies the people to a cause or a vision amen and that's what it is it represents something to us that's what makes it heroic that's what it represents something to you it represents something to I amen you know it's like our country's flag the flag in this country it used to mean something to people and it doesn't mean to many people what it used to mean amen when that Star-Spangled Banner flew over Fort McHenry and and uh and Francis Scott Key wrote that it meant something to him it meant something to the people that were watching there amen when when Marines they stormed at the top of Iwo Jima during the second world war and six Marines they got up there and they raised the flag at the top of the hill what was the significance of a piece of cloth on a pole it's not the cloth that has the virtue it's not the step it's what it represented to the men that they would put themselves in the midst of a fire fight in the midst of battle to raise it up because it meant something to them hey man I was I when I was a kid I I and I had to go look it up because it had been so long ago but there was a story from the Civil War about a man named Thomas Plunkett that's a good old sassafras hillbilly name if I've ever heard one Thomas Plunkett well it's not as cool as magooless I guess Thomas plunken anybody ever heard of Thomas Plunkett they called him the hero of four words and I'll explain in a moment Thomas Plunkett was in the Union Army and he'd fought at the Battle of uh of Gettysburg he'd been at Fredericksburg he'd been these different places and one day I'm sorry he's at the Battle of Fredericksburg one day and he's fighting and they had the standard Bearer with the Union flag in front of them and they were waving into gunfire and the guy that held the standard he got shot down and as the flag began to fall another man ran up and grabbed the flag that the flag would not fall to the ground and when that mental third man came in and when that man felt Thomas Plunkett he was the only one close enough he went and grabbed the American flag he grabbed the Union flag and he held it high and he cried out four words don't let it fall don't let it fall boys and and as he takes the flag uh Cannon fires and the shrapnel lands in him and it explodes and it rips off one of his arms and he think he'll get shot and he loses his other arm he's lost both arms and he still holding the American flag with the stump of one of his arms up and it becomes such a great hero they give him a medal they you know they do all these things after the war but that's what he was known as the hero of four words because he held up a flag now I want you to understand that flag is just a piece of cloth in and of itself if you took one of my suits today and you hung it on a pole and said I'm gonna shoot at that that suit and I want you to go get it I'll be like you know what I'll go get another one I'll go to pennies or The Bargain Bin or whatever you can keep it amen the virtue of the flag was not in its with material it represents something it represents men who died lives that were lost blood that was shed it represents something that's what makes it heroic that's what makes it so great that a man would lose his limbs a man with hazardous life for it amen listen this Bible is just a book it's that's all you treat it as but when you realize what was paid for it how many rules are coming across them pay and William Kendall for you and I to stand here today and preach out of this Bible right when you realize what it costs a man like William random to preach this message he knew it would cost him ten thousand friends he knew it would cost a lot of kinds of things but they stood there because they believed in what it was saying yeah that's not the book it's the one that testifies of Jesus Christ that's why we're here today that's why we related our lives for this gospel because it represents something greater than your life or my life that represents Jesus Christ in the Saints of all ages it means something to us yes more than just paper and gilded pages and represents something and that's what makes it special and yes sir amen that's what makes the flag special it's not the flag it's what it represents dangers that were endured and soldiers people that paid they paid with their lives so you and I could sing here today and bellyache about to go you know I can complain about gas prices well listen somebody paid a price for us to be able to do that yeah yeah we take it for granted and that's why we find ourselves in a defeated condition this country in a defeated condition having rejected the gospel because they forgot they didn't remember the Lord they forgot how they got here they forgot the price of their father's paid in the revolution all right listen that's just a natural War brother man talks about this it's a 1960 unchangeable word of God it's at these wars you take these young kids out just the cream of the crop because they don't know no better no known discipline Army discipline stick your head up over the hill and let somebody shoot it off die like a hero they gladly do it run up on one of them he said run there on one and shot down another and shot down shot down the nation forgets them unless their family come back this here whenever they come back Jesus you see what I mean many of the soldiers but Sodom oh my God but a man sell them will you ever find one that'll lay down his life for the cause of Christ he won't even cry oh my God he wouldn't cry on the shade tree and go to church he won't even get out from behind the television long enough to attend the Wednesday Wednesday night prayer meeting that's right it's a shame disgrace he said that's the reason Angels don't visit the churches that's the reason Angels don't visit homes we've got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing the angels of God are here on Earth tonight that night on that night tonight they're here today he says just the same as they've always been yes yes amen what kind of a what kind of heroism look around he he's especially he always uses he talks about that Mama dear hey man he talks about that Mom and Dad when all burp oh Snake Eyes burp was getting ready to shoot that Fawn and that mom he said well that's a mom listen a mother's a heroic person and you say well you know I just I raise my kids for the Lord I I just raised him and I did this listen that's not a little thing you're the Fifth Gospel right right and then listen when we live in an age where the idea of motherhood is so distorted and perverted listen you've got women they won't raise their kids at all or they refuse to even have children they won't they won't lead to the Lord and anything and you've got Godly women listen you've got if that deer oh my God if that Gear's got more Mama about her about her than most of these women in the world what about you sisters of God that have raised your children you're raised your children for the Lord whether you realize that's a heroic thing you're just taking your stand upon the word listen your kids are hearing all kinds of opinions right right here you shouldn't hear all kinds of voices no and you say well not my children they don't hear it listen every time you go to the store they see it every magazine rack every hour they walk down the world's bombarding them with death and sting in the boxing But You christian mothers you took a stand you put yourselves In Harm's Way you face ridicule you face backlash because you believe the word of God we ought to be on and let the hero that you are for taking a stand for this gospel listen to The Prophet preached about a deer I could preach about the bride of Jesus Christ that's right amen well the man talks about Arnold Von Winkle Reed what a hero yes man they're they're making statues of them they're singing songs ain't it that man didn't go out that day thinking man they're gonna sing songs about me they're going to preach about me that he wasn't that's not why he was out there but he was out there for his homeland he woke up one morning probably like most of us would on the cold hard ground probably didn't feel too great and he went out there when he looked down the spears of these trained soldiers we looked down and saw the threat of whorham it dawned on him there must be a way for Liberty and he said you men you harping underneath today I died for Switzerland well what will you do Arnold Von Winkler read he said I'm going to take my arms and I'm going to charge the enemy with nothing in my hand but when I charge the enemy I'll take their Spears and draw them into my bosom and when I do you men charge right when I do not sit there and watch you charge I will make a way for Liberty listen one man made a decision and one man made a decision that led an entire nation to Liberty has kept them to this day I'm on the brand often he quotes young fellows the Psalm of Life it says in the world's broad field of battle and the biblical lack of Life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife hey man I want you to understand something I'm not just using this poem for a Doctrine but you cannot be a hero in the time of ease or peace amen right there must be some extraordinary circumstances that come along and then without chaos there's no Heroes but it's it's in the time of strife it's the time of difficulty like a banner like a flag when they're lifted up when you see their example that's when that's when it's going to miss the chaos amen it's not so much that Strife makes people in the heroes amen difficulties and trials and tribulations all they do is reveal what kind of a characters are you in the first place and we we try to avoid trials and God's saying listen those fiery trials they're worth more than gold Prime of fire the trying your faith is worth something to God the God is trying to reveal the character of this bribe of Jesus Christ that should not like a bunch of cattle you're not cattle you're sheep and you're on the right Shepherd amen you're not driven by the things of this world praise the Lord it's a difficulty it reveals Heroes you know here a few months back uh so so I'm a gun guy a little bit not an expert I'm an American so are you but you know they're getting ready to pass this bill here a while back they're wanting to ban these certain guns and ban this and that and that's when all the keyboard Warriors come on all these men with their keyboards and their lazy boys ah they'll have to oh wow you're a big man there and I'm shaking won't go near that guys how's he might have to get up out of his chair you know what I'm saying Everybody Talks big oh if this happens I'm gonna be on my front lawn and I'll be defying the government and I'll be doing this Muscle Man gonna do nothing you know why because they don't do nothing now foreign but what do you do when the trial comes that's what proves whether you're here I'm not who talks a big game everybody can talk well praise the Lord listen we stand here and I'm grateful today to stand here in a message church and preach to people that believe this message that sympathize with this message but that by itself isn't heroic listen it's easy to preach the people believe what you believe oh well listen if I you know I'm going to defy the world unless that man they can't even they can't do nothing for the Lord if everybody's not watching the church well praise Lord will people they might not like me they might not like what I have to say they didn't like what the prophets had to say hi there that's why they killed him and Jesus said be like one of them right all right praise the Lord the Bible says if you faint in the day of adversity your strength is small it doesn't matter how much you can bench press it don't matter how much you can lift if you can work 16 hours a day when Trouble Comes if you can't take a stand your strength is small amen well be not dumb driven cattle hey man I always use this point you know cattle they're driven but she followed hey man a lot of people they're just driven they'll they'll say I'm gonna do this and I'll Never back up on this message and I'll never do that but the first sign of Trouble Comes they're driven by fear it's like I used the example there uh with the government well you know I believe we should Render unto Caesar well I believe that too but here's the problem most people they don't render under Caesar because they believe in obedience because they're afraid Caesar and most people will do whatever fear drives them to do and listen that's not remarkable if you're just here today because you feel compelled to be here today because you're afraid of the consequences listen you need a little more you need a bigger backbone it's time to get rid of the wishbone amen praise the Lord my concern is that people go along with things or don't go along with things they're not doing it for an ethical reason or because it's right or wrong they do it because of what is convenient hey man but if you always just do you just ah you know I'm gonna go whichever way the wind blows I'm gonna do whatever makes everybody happy that's a coward hey man brother man said God don't want cowards he wants somebody who will stand he didn't want somebody that's ashamed to testify their boss he don't want somebody that's afraid to tell the doctor that God healed you he wants a hero amen how do you act when it's not a favorable condition how do you act when the conditions are against you when the odds are stacked against you that will show what kind of character you have amen praise the Lord amen well I just it's the truth many people they're like I said they're just whichever way the wind blows why because they're chaff for the wind has a word for that cannon fodder no I I don't like to think of people that way but it's true but that's what most of the world is it's just a bunch of Cannon butter they're just there to go about their day-to-day they collect a paycheck they watch their favorite game they do their favorite thing and they just go from day to day they're driven like cattle it's just a number in the system but for you and I there's something different about us amen we're not citizens of this world we're citizens of a greater Kingdom a greater world I mean you not you might not be great in this world but there's a greater world of which you are a part of you're a citizen you're a fellow Heir with Jesus Christ [Music] oh my god listen if we were just here to eat and drink and be merry that'd be one thing but listen your soul it's worth ten thousand words that person next to you their soul is worth ten thousand worlds to God that person at work that drives you nuts their soul is worth ten thousand worlds to God that family member just drives you up a wall but guess what their soul is worth ten thousand worlds to God you can run away from all your troubles or you can take a stand and believe God because there are people that are driven like cattle but then there's some people they're sheep they just don't know who to follow yet amen Jesus dealt with the same thing Mark chapter six Jesus he looked out and he saw the people in the Bible said he had compassion toward them because they were a sheep not having a Shepherd he began to teach them many things see Jesus saw their need for direction Jesus offered them a way of Direction Jesus is the direction he is the way of Direction amen and brother man said he's the greatest example of heroism we've ever had Jesus Christ like a great Banner this hero of a greater world he was what was he done he was lifted up amen when did he fulfill his purpose when he was lifted up he healed the sick he raised the dead he cast out Devils he cleansed lepers but when the son of man was lifted up he said if I the son of man be lifted up I will draw all men unto me listen he's lifted up he fulfilled his purpose and he cried and he's finished and they threw him in the grave but this same Jesus God has highly exalted him once again his exaltation is the Salvation to everyone that believed because he was lifted up [Music] amen listen to the Bible says when he ascended what did he do he led he land captivity captive we've got a great Captain a leadership we're not cattle today we are being led by an undefeated Captain the captain of the host of the honor the Lord is leading us today if he can lead captivity Captain if he can lead him out of grave that they've been in for thousands of years he can lead you to the promise he can leave your home he can leave their job he can leave you wherever he needs to lead you [Music] Isaiah chapter 11 in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an end sin it's a banner it's a pennant an Ace and for the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious amen Paul quotes us again in Romans 15. he says Isaiah said there shall be a root of Jesse and he that shall rise to Reign Over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles Trust so I want you to really understand this that's why I talk about the flag earlier hero is like a banner they're lifted up their example lifted up before the people give them a direction it inspires them Psalm 60 says Thou Hast given a banner to them that fear thee and it may be displaying and then it doesn't work unless it's on display right it's like a token amen it's got to be on display to be effective oh my he said that it may be displayed because of that truth Selah that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and hear me so here's the things about a banner there it's it's an identification it's visible and it's elevated and when it does all those things it gives a direction it's like a banner and the scripture calls god Jehovah Nissi the Lord is my banner you remember the story in the book of Exodus the 17th chapter when the people of Israel begin to make war and and Moses he stood Atop The Hill he stood atop the mountain and he lifted up his hands and when he lifted up his hands when they were elevated when he raised them the people fought and the people had victory finally and after a while it began to get tired I thought about that the other day said how long does fight go I realized he was an 80 year old man but his strength wasn't diminished so you know he's like a 40 year old man who should be able to do a little bit and then I thought about well I'm about 40. if I do this for a few minutes start getting tired don't pick almost it's not his fault Moses he's holding his hands up as an instant of Victory and when his hands begin to get heavy the people begin to turn the other way in the battle so so the Bible says that Aaron and her they sat Moses on a rock oh yeah they sent him on a rock he said Moses if you can't stand sit on this Rock Rest on this rock and we'll hold your hands up if we can't if listen if you're not a Moses today then you hold up the hands of whoever Moses is amen we're not all called to be the seventh messenger but we can hold up the message that he preached we're not all called to be the pastor but when the pastor gets down when the pastor goes through things you can hold him up in prayer because listen he's giving us an answer this message has been given as a banner and it was there it was there when they had victory over the enemy there he was called Jehovah Nissi the Lord is my banner the Lord is my refuge you look at that word in the Hebrew it's something that is exalted when he's lifted up then we had Victory then he was a refuge to us amen don't take the band and fold it up and put in the claws and break it out on Memorial Day and Veterans Day Hold It Up Lift It Up over every enemy lift it up over every circumstance in your life the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flag not when things are going well not when everything's just peaching and you're living on the Bed of Roses when the enemy's coming in like a flood God said I am gonna raise up a standard I will lift up a people filled with my spirit in defiance of every enemy in defiance of all the powers of Darkness I will raise up a people my spirit it won't be by your might it's not by your power it's by his Spirit his spirit and you defies the world it defies every Power of the enemy man listen when the enemies coming like a flood that's not the time to sit down and fold your hands right that's the time to take your stand say God's never left himself without a witness and this day is no different my God is still God [Music] well be a hero well that's probably a good sign you're called to be brother Brown says this in perfect strength my perfect weakness he says notice it takes the weakest and the rejected and practically every hero that God ever had on the front line was that type of person that's that person Moses was there he is telling God listen I can't do this I can't do this I can't do this well look you can't because I said you can there's getting behind the wine press listen he's threshing wheat behind he's not even the right place he's hiding out he's not pressing wheat in the wheat field or barley in The Barley field he's behind the wine press and God says you're a mighty man of Valor one might think God was being cruel is God trying to make fun of me no God sees something in you you don't see because God knew when the battle come where did he was going to take his stand praise God he says this a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all right then that person is just in good shape so God can start using them that's right it's when they feel like they can't a couple you've been there before probably all of you if you're being real honest it's when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves this is the other side we get these feelings that we think that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it but if then if we'll listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants us to get into that kind of shape so he can hey man I mentioned William Tyndall earlier these men in the throughout the scripture and throughout history I want you to understand the they were not seen well by their contemporaries amen the people didn't love the prophets of all until they killed him first amen listen brother bam said Jesus he was a renegade to the people your lord was not labeled as some lofty wonderful person listen they loved it when he healed the sick they loved it when he did all these Miracles when he multiplied the loaves but when you get to preach I am a father of one they wanted nothing to do with him he's a troublemaker he's flipping over tables just everywhere he goes it's a bunch of trouble all these message people why can't they just get along with everybody else why can't they just compromise their doctor a little bit we're not asking for them to stop dressing a certain way of this thing just kind of compromise a little that and then listen why they're going to be so Troublesome all the time because they believe God that's why because they don't care what man has to say about it and listen you're going to be labeled as a renegade you're going to be called every kind of name of the book well you're just a fanatican you're just this and you're in a cult no I believe the Lord Jesus Christ I believe every word in this Bible it's yeah and amen to me I don't have to compromise I don't have to water it down I don't have to update it there's no virtue in compromising that hey Matt listen these men like I said they they were not regarded as Heroes by their contemporaries listen Jesus wasn't regarded as a hero by the people of Israel they hate him to this day but they're Heroes they're not Heroes of this world that's the difference they're not the heroes that make history books they're not the heroes we build statues to they're not the heroes that can't sing songs about all the time they're not the heroes of this world is why they're the heroes of another world of a greater world and Jesus is not the hero of this world all right and anytime we try to present them that way make a social gospel of it we've diminished the strength of it his strength his his image as a hero is not what he's doing in this world to the world for the world but it's like he's been exalted over he's greater this world does not compare there's nothing here that can compare the things that he has prepared for us this world nothing here is worthy to be compared to it amen even the natural these these men and these women they did these things they weren't doing it for the world they lived in they did it for the world that they were trying to create they did it for the world that they wanted for their children for their families for their posterities they had a vision they had an ambition for something greater and their acts changed the world they're asked to change the world socially or politically what about Jesus Christ he's going to make all things new the Bible says behalf I make all heavens and earth new he's creating a new Earth whether and dwell with righteousness amen I think of Nehemiah here at the beginning that I read about one thing I love about Nehemiah he's a he's a seemingly innocuous or inconspicuous person he's the king's cup Bearer The Bible doesn't say that you know he was the father so and so and this and that and he's got some great lineage of David doesn't say that Nehemiah you know like David he was on the head of an excellent Spirit nobody knew who Nehemiah hardly was but one day Nehemiah heard there was trouble in the Homeland he heard about trouble you know what he was not indifferent to his plight he was not indifferent to his people he began to weep and he become sad and he began to pray he began to seek the Lord and so Lord we've we've done you wrong we've done evil against you but Lord you hear these people you hear the threatenings you see the condition he began to cry out to God God there's got to be a change there's got to be a Deliverance for these people God picks up this man Nehemiah that nobody paid any attention to one day the king notices well you look kind of sad what's going on it's funny how God will take somebody that seems so insignificant to the world amen right maybe you feel like you're that person listen that's the type of people God uses hey man God's Not Looking listen it's like even the prophet Samuel think about that here's a here's an anointed prophet of God and he goes to visit the house of Jesse he said oh well here's the oldest that's got to be it no that's not what I picked what about this one about this one no I want that little that little wimp over that little shrimp right there I want him I'm annoying that's a man that's not a little boy that's a man after my own heart beautiful this is the guy listen God doesn't judge his men judge and then look at the outward appearance we look and say well this hero he's got a big symbol on his chest and big muscles and it's not that don't make you a hero man's not to turn by the size of his muscles he's not determined by the size of his bank account but by the bags in his knees where he's been praying that's what determines what makes a man praise the Lord this man he and I love Nehemiah because he's a man of he's a man of remarkable vision ambition again he's a pragmatic he's a methodical person but yet he's a man of great faith and hope and God and what I love about Nehemiah in this context especially what I'm talking about today is Nehemiah was the type of person that knew how to Rally the people together when people were discouraged when people were frightened and the people didn't know what to do Nehemiah wasn't just we'll just get scared and hide your buns uh a rock or something no he was a man that said but remember we're here for a purpose remember that sickness you're going through you're here for a purpose that trial you're going through maybe your family's rejected you whatever it is but you're here for a purpose don't forget you're here to do something God's got confidence in you that you'll take a moral stand that you'll stand on this word in the hour of Temptation in the hour of adversity you won't faint because God in you is greater than he that's in the world oh yeah and in the scripture when the people become frightened he begins to speak to the Nobles and to the rulers and to the people and he says he says don't be afraid of the enemy don't be afraid of them remember the Lord remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren for your sons fight for your daughters your wives and your households this is me get discouraged many times because we don't remember the Lord we remember what the doctor said we remember what people in our lives said about us we think about everything we we read in the newspaper I want you to remember the Lord the next time you get discouraged the next time you get afraid remember the Lord and fight don't back down don't hide fight you've got a reason to fight why are we fighting fight for your sons fight for your daughters fight for your wives fight for your households remember the Lord how many remembers of the Lord today let's remember him let's forget about everything else let's press for the mark for the prize of the High Calling we can look at circumstances we can look at discouragement we can look at the Lord we can look at an end since it's been lifted up over us listen we've got every reason just stay in the battle we've got every reason to press the battle it's not a time to go settle down the bunker somewhere this is the time to press the battle Victory Is Ours already we're not fighting against the powerful enemy we're fighting a defeated enemy [Applause] we you know like I said we did we get discouraged with people sometimes but brother you don't know what people have done to me oh they might have done lots of things to you the Lord knows about it you know I think the problem many times with church we spend too much time fighting with people not enough time fighting poor people anybody Nehemiah didn't say remember the Lord fight your sons and fight your no that's not what he said sometimes when you're so busy fighting people we're supposed to be fighting for certain people supposed to be fighting for that one that one that hates you is the One You're supposed to love hey man oh but listen they just drive me up the wall and listen I get it unless it's sometimes fighting with people is fighting for people sometimes you gotta stand for something that's wrong I believe that amen right wait well praise the Lord we get so complacent as church people we don't want to rock the boat I'm saying wow I was talking to I was talking to some young people the other day I was talking about William Booth somebody knows who William Booth is part of the Salvation Army listen he came to church for the first he he'd grown up in like a formal dead church and he went to Methodist Church and this is back when the Methodist Church used to shout he comes in there and they're preaching salvation through Christ they're preaching you know uh everybody's saying amen hallelujah they're having a good time like this is great they get saved and he goes comes to the Lord and and then he he comes from a poor family he begins to preach the poor he goes to the docks he goes to peers he goes everywhere he's preaching the poor and he brings the poor to church one day he's evangelized all these people right he gets there and the churches they send the deacons out said we don't want him here now he loved this church is great I said we don't want these people here with we've got a certain image we've got a certain image we're trying to protect and he's thinking well that's not what the image was in the Bible amen listen that man he could have capitulated to make his ministry in the Methodist Church great but he took a stand and he began to produce soup kitchens and he began to feed the poor he began to educate him he created jobs for him listen one man took a stand amen and it changed the dynamic of England it changed the way labor worked in the whole country don't tell me God can't change the situation with one person amen that's all he needs but many times we stand and we're just complacent well that's just how it's going to be it doesn't have to be that way it's that way because you let it be that way all right well listen I've just always dealt with this and I've always had this problem well that's probably because you've always dealt with it the same way I mean you've complained about it you've tried to figure it out you've tried to reason with it you've tried to use wisdom how about you remember the Lord and lift him up one time instead of saying my lost loved ones why can't I get them to serve God why don't you just plead the blood of Jesus Christ for him for once say Lord I know you're more than able I've tried I've pleaded but Lord I'm trusting you now whatever sickness comes whatever problems comes I'm gonna lift up the name of the Lord over it now instead of fighting with everybody let's fight for them you've got people to fight for they're important you hold this token high today for our sons and for our daughters for our brother and our wives our households and I get it sometimes some of the hardest people to fight for and that wasn't a fight for people they're so ungrateful because Jesus did it for you when you were ungrateful because Jesus saw something in you when you weren't looking for him you weren't after him but he was lifted up for your Saints [Applause] I mean he's glad about what God's done in your life we're all glad right well listen he didn't do it because because you were grateful about it at the time actually we weren't even here at the time right we spend our lives in Rebellion against God we spend our lives chasing our own wealth but you know what he was lifted up for you regardless because he had confidence that what you were is not who you are that person you fight with that person said there's no chance brother Rim got that way one time amen he got to such a place because of being rejected over this message he lost his feeling for the people and he began to sass him call his rickies and rickettas and God said some of them are my children some of them people you don't think will ever make it they're the ones that are going to make it the Sinners and the publicans they enter into the kingdom first well praise the Lord amen Jesus shouldn't have got for us and we were unworthy we didn't want nothing to do with him we heart in our hearts against God he stood for us anyway sometimes you got to stick take a stand even when it's even when it's unpopular with the people that you're standing for you even when they don't care you still gotta take your stand oh my praise the Lord remember the Lord he said Jesus Christ is not the hero of this world he's the hero of a greater world amen and I say this many times and I believe it there's only there there's really only one hero in this story there's many examples of Heroes and many examples of heroism but there's one real hero amen because without this hero none of us are here today none of us can take this stand it's because of what Jesus Christ had did for us if he had not fulfilled the law and the prophets if he not stood in the midst of opposition then we're dead in our sins today true and his heroism that's something we should remember you know I was looking about Sam Houston when he when he goes to fight General santiana down there in Texas they Remember the Alamo that become their Battle Cry remember what these men lay down for the independence of the Republic of Texas men like Davy Crockett and and Jim Bowie they laid down their lives and when they got to that massive remember now remember people have paved the way for us remember the Alamo hey man when we got into World War II they remembered Pearl Harbor every time they thought how can we go on what we're going to do remember what happened we will not forget we shall remember I remember what the enemy's done but I remember what the Lord has done when you get discouraged I want to remind you you remember the cross you remember the resurrection you remember there's an empty two you remember the Lord Jesus Christ don't forget when you forget that's when your strength is small but lift up the Lord amen amen listen we're not just women even now we have victory we've heard a message what is the message brother Vincent is a trumpet to declare a script to a war they're not here to negotiate with the Enemy today we're here for war we've heard the trumpet and Nehemiah said when you hear the trumpet you gather there don't gather on your reputation don't gather on ecclesiastical Spirits gather around where the trumpet is sounded why was the message sounded to gather the people together [Music] they looked all spread out they're all spread along the wall they look like a separated people well brother so-and-so lives over here and so-and-so does this and they're doing their own thing but we gather around the message the message is what calls us together for battle it is not given an uncertain sound it has declared the battle is on Hallelujah oh my why gather to the trumpet why gather their lesson it's one thing for us to fight it's one thing for us to show up and fight but Nehemiah should gather where this Trump is blown there's where Jehovah nissi's Gonna Be Our God shall fight for us listen it's wondering if you're doing the thing he's gonna fight for you oh my brother man says brother I mean if there was ever a Time when those disciples picked up that baptism of the Holy Ghost one of the mightiest weapons that's ever been given to the hands of men and they cut a hole through sin and they defeated the devil and run him back with sickness and all these things man wants to see heroism men are waiting for a gallon stand the world's waiting to find a man who can step out show them Jesus Christ hey man what am I going to show them show them what the Lord's done for you remember the Lord lift him up listen your testimony you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be some educated person your testimonies got power in it your testimony has prophetic power to lose the chains of sin to Open the Eyes of the blind your testimony of what God did in your life brother man said you don't know where to start tell them how your candle got lit how much the Lord did for you remember the Lord rehearse it day and night testify what God's doing floor true oh but brother I'm so discouraged I'm so hurt I don't I don't want to go on listen if a man like Thomas Plunkett if a man like Thomas Punk he can stand there with both of his arms gone and a bunch of bullet holes in his chest you can stand for this word when it's unpopular you can stand for this word when nobody likes it far a bit for me to back down when that man's willing to die for a flag we think I can't serve God it's just too hard that men didn't have an arm to hold the flag up and he still did it oh you think you lack the strength oh my god listen you can't get great victories without great battles hey man what good does it do to break down the first sign of trouble there's no virtue in the I mean I was telling them testimonies earlier about my my health and stuff like that I don't stand up here today listen I I stood in the Pulpit having heart pain and different things and like I said I just assume you know what if I'm gonna die I might as well die preaching the gospel I'm not saying I was gonna die but what I'm saying is listen do I have some better exit strategies well listen I don't want to die preaching I'm going to die this way that way listen as long as I'm dying in the will of God I can't die anyway right you can't die if you're a Christian you just change your destination let me declare let the prophet David occur I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in our eyes listen something you know about my testimony with my daughter Jana my daughter Jana when she was getting ready to be born the doctors induced my wife and and then the doctor he went off got coffee or something he just didn't show up for a while and I'm sitting in the hospital going well I don't know what's going on and the anesthesiologist comes in they want me to leave the room which they've never done that before but whatever so I leave the room and I come back 45 minutes later and they're whisking her out on a stretcher ah actually I was a little confused about the whole thing no idea what's going to happen will this nurse come in and she began to tell me that my my daughter Jana and her Court was prolapsed she hadn't gotten oxygen in other words it was pinched off in the birth canal and she hadn't breathed for 13 minutes before they even found it and they say brain damage sets in after 15 minutes no oxygen to the brain she'd already gone 13 before they even wheeled her out my wife out to do an emergency C-section so the nurses tell me all this and I'm thinking well okay whatever he said well your daughter's probably gonna have brain damage you know if she had told me that once I'd be like well she's just trying to do her job she just kept bringing it up and I'm thinking well I'm not having none of this listen I'll let you do it once oh and listen this is the thing I've got tremendous respect for parents that if their child has a disability or something they raise them I've got all the respect in the world for that I would have loved my child all the same when that nurse began pushing her narrative at me well listen it's just I I'm just trying to prepare you just really letting you know she said that the third time and I finally I looked at her said well listen I have a reason to be worried if I weren't a Christian I'd have a reason to worry if I weren't a Christian listen my God's Not I just I felt Within Myself people say were you afraid brother not one bit and that wasn't me as a man that's not my courage that's the Lord I remember the Lord my Lord is more than able he's more than able to deliver her God in my life when I should have died and the doctor said I should have God was more than able I remember the Lord people I had a brother text me the day were you afraid brother when you found out no because I remember the Lord God is faithful he's been my healer he's been my savior he's been my peace he's been my joy I remember the Lord I'm not saying that the boast about me I'm boasting on him will you boast on him with me a little bit today lift him up today he's more than able he's learning He's Worthy why should we fear why should we be discouraged Our God shall fight for us [Music] we get indifferent about things God's not indifferent about your soul God's not even indifferent about your health and say well that's just the body well God made your body to live in right that's right if you didn't care about anyone the more stripes on his back for it God cares about you you're important to God he put himself In Harm's Way he had a right to go live as any other man but he threw himself into the cross into the midst of danger even against his own will wonderful he could have called for Angels he didn't have to but he threw himself In Harm's Way as a man not a superhero with a bulletproof vest on as a man he laid down his life so that you and I could have Liberty today [Applause] we got such a culture I tell you what uh oh praise the Lord it's gonna sound bad but our our men are so emasculated we want our women to act like men are men to act like I don't know why hey man listen the man in this country they used to lay down their lives for things and nowadays everybody just wants to run away from trouble listen God's people don't run away from trouble listen Trump is going to find you anyway that's right I found out one thing in my life you run from your trials you get tired before they do you can run and you can run and you can run and all you're going to do is wear yourself out you're better off taking your stand and turning facing the enemy and drawing your sword and say you know what if I've got to die I'm gonna die fighting for my king not expected every one of us will do their Duty in the line of battle God can only use a soldier he can trust my mind I thank God for people of intercession your intercessors crisis in there says but
