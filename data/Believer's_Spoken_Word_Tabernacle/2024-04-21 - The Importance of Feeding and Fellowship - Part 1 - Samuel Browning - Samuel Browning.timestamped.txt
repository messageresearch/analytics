[41:18] just don't have the words Lord even lord
[41:21] of the request and Lord many times Lord
[41:25] where I've told you I I don't even know
[41:26] how to approach this Lord I don't even
[41:29] have the words or know the right words
[41:31] to say but I know that you are the alls
[41:33] sufficient one for this need or
[41:36] situation or whatever it might be Lord
[41:39] You're All Things Lord now father again
[41:43] that little boy who was in a field and
[41:46] that older man Lord had passed by and
[41:49] all he heard was this little boy saying
[41:51] his
[41:52] ABCs and they asked him the question he
[41:55] said what were you doing he said I was
[41:56] praying
[41:58] Lord that older gentleman said well all
[42:01] you were doing was saying the ABCs he
[42:03] said yes he said I didn't know what
[42:07] words to say but I just figured if I
[42:09] send up the letters he knew what was in
[42:11] my heart and he could put the words
[42:14] together Lord we love you this morning
[42:19] I'm so thankful that God that as Paul
[42:21] could write Lord even expressing of that
[42:25] Lord Assurance in our growth and our
[42:27] walk with you that Lord the spirit
[42:30] helpeth our infirmities Lord that God it
[42:33] Mak maketh groanings and intercessions
[42:36] Lord with groanings that cannot be
[42:38] uttered Lord father to know that as
[42:40] we're walking Lord as Priests of the
[42:42] Living God and Lord lives that have been
[42:45] redeemed Lord when our hearts Lord like
[42:47] you spoke to Joshua that Lord he would
[42:49] not depart from the word that Lord it
[42:52] would always be Lord that which would be
[42:54] in his mouth and he would meditate on it
[42:56] day and night Lord Lord that oh God as
[42:58] we look in your word Lord many times we
[43:01] look Lord at the word and we can look at
[43:03] ourselves but Lord I take the report of
[43:06] the word Lord God and just want to
[43:08] submit myself Lord to the word and come
[43:11] under the word because the word Lord is
[43:13] what will bring forth Lord from our
[43:15] lives Lord and to know that God that
[43:17] there is a spirit of intercession Lord
[43:20] that moves Lord in our hearts oh God to
[43:22] draw upon our high priest Lord from the
[43:25] throne of grace oh God to draw the
[43:27] strength that we have need of Lord down
[43:29] into our lives oh God to bring about

[45:08] Beyond this physical address Lord of
[45:11] Lake Breeze Road Lord God may we lord
[45:13] God be lifted in the Heavenly places
[45:15] Lord and to behold you father Lord
[45:18] plainly Lord granted Lord we ask it
[45:21] father in the precious name of Jesus
[45:24] Christ amen and amen
[45:27] amen if you'll turn with me to Ruth
[45:29] chapter
[45:29] 2 amen I want to begin with verse eight
[45:33] there and want to say God bless you it's
[45:35] so good to see each and every one of you
[45:38] amen and I I always mean that it's good
[45:40] it's always good to come together amen
[45:43] and to Fellowship around the word of the
[45:45] Lord amen I certainly always believe and
[45:48] I know that God always has something
[45:50] very very personal for us and uh just as
[45:54] we're standing here we we certainly
[45:56] desire your prayers that God would help
[45:58] all of us to step aside these few
[46:00] moments that he gives us here
[46:02] Amen in Ruth chapter 2 and verse 8 and I
[46:07] want to just read a few of these verses
[46:08] just for a little background and uh as
[46:11] we're getting into the thought this
[46:13] morning and notice these are the first
[46:15] words I pick up in verse eight these are
[46:17] the first words that now that Ruth has
[46:20] had expressed or spoken to her from baz
[46:24] now she doesn't know who baz is she
[46:26] doesn't really even know the
[46:28] significance of what all of this is
[46:31] really about but she is simply as we
[46:33] read in here and we have been she is
[46:36] just simply basking in the grace of God
[46:40] that she has come to experience and to
[46:42] know in her life so here Boaz says to
[46:45] Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not
[46:48] to glean in another field neither go
[46:51] from hence but abide here fast by my
[46:54] maidens and let thine eyes be on the
[46:57] field that they do reap and go Thou
[47:00] after them have I not charged the young
[47:03] men that they shall not touch thee and
[47:06] when thou art a thirst go unto the
[47:09] vessels and drink of that which the
[47:11] young men have drawn how many appreciate
[47:15] refreshment amen I I really appreciate
[47:17] that then she fell on her face and bowed
[47:21] herself to the ground and said unto him
[47:24] why have I found Grace in th thine eyes
[47:28] that thou should us take knowledge of me
[47:31] seeing I am a
[47:33] stranger she knows who she is she knows
[47:36] that she knows these things and she's
[47:40] there's no covering up on it she just
[47:42] recognizing this is Grace you've spoken
[47:44] to me and called me your daughter a term
[47:47] of endearment why how have I found Grace
[47:50] in thine eyes and Boaz says unto her it
[47:53] hath been fully showed me all that thou
[47:56] Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since
[47:59] the death of thine husband and how thou
[48:01] Hast left thy father and thy mother and
[48:04] the land of thy Nativity and art come
[48:07] unto a people which thou knewest not
[48:11] hither toor the Lord recompense thy Work
[48:14] and a full reward be given thee of the
[48:17] Lord God of Israel under whose wings
[48:21] Thou Art come to trust then she said let
[48:25] me find favor in thy sight my Lord if
[48:28] you really look at the writing of it
[48:30] it's it's with a confession I believe I
[48:32] will find more favor in thy sight for
[48:36] thou Hast comforted me for thou Hast
[48:39] spoken friendly unto thine handmade
[48:43] though I be not like unto one of thine
[48:47] handmaids and this is where I want to BR
[48:49] move into this morning and bohas said
[48:52] unto her at mil time Come Thou hither
[48:57] and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel
[49:00] in the vinegar and she sat beside the
[49:03] Reapers and he reached her parched corn
[49:08] and she did eat and was sufficed and
[49:11] left amen may God bless you and bless
[49:14] the reading of the word as you're being
[49:16] seated I want to read to you a quote
[49:18] here this morning
[49:20] that brother brandom specifically
[49:22] speaking of this particular verse in the
[49:25] message and you
[49:27] you know this whole uh expression of
[49:30] Ruth it's all the way through the
[49:32] message what a what a a book that speaks
[49:36] of the Redemption and Redemptive work of
[49:39] the Lord Jesus Christ among his bride
[49:42] body it's a little book but within that
[49:46] little book there is a a woman who comes
[49:50] into Divine favor and as we see this
[49:54] within Ruth and all of this conect ction
[49:57] that's here brother Bram says it like
[49:59] this in the message Redeemer and
[50:01] Redemption and that recording along with
[50:02] that last scripture he said now when it
[50:06] comes the midday and you get tired and
[50:09] come over come over and sit down under
[50:11] the tree and take the morsel of bread
[50:14] and dip right in with the rest of them
[50:17] oh I like that that's Fellowship you see
[50:21] get around get right around under the
[50:23] shade tree don't you love to get under
[50:27] there and just dip right in with the
[50:30] rest of them that's so I want to
[50:32] continue that we've been looking at the
[50:34] thought on the value of obedience and
[50:37] that's kind of the overarching part but
[50:39] I want to deal with a subject here and I
[50:41] I'm going to ask you not to allow your
[50:43] mind to venture out into where you think
[50:45] I'm going to go this morning because
[50:47] even though I'm going to cover familiar
[50:49] territory but there's a way that I want
[50:51] us to look at these things and I want to
[50:53] speak on the thought of the importance
[50:55] of feeding Ing and
[50:58] fellowship the importance of feeding and
[51:02] fellowship I I look at this within Ruth
[51:05] and I you know I how you you Ponder upon
[51:08] these things many times she's a
[51:10] moabit background that she's come from
[51:14] that's
[51:15] known that word had traveled quickly
[51:18] because even the Reapers were able to
[51:21] tell Boaz when he asked who is this
[51:24] damsel that's right here they were a
[51:26] able to describe who she was and that
[51:28] she indeed was a moabitas what a what a
[51:32] a reputation to have upon her character
[51:36] or her name but you see underneath that
[51:40] that title of moabit there was a real
[51:43] character as a matter of fact when you
[51:45] go back and study in the scriptures you
[51:47] recognize that even when God came up to
[51:50] deal with with Moab in when misra was in
[51:53] their Journey God would not let every
[51:55] one of them be extinguished or taken out
[51:58] because there was a seed that was going
[52:00] to come forth by the name of Ruth so no
[52:03] matter how Bleak or uh it would be there
[52:06] was a character and I want you to
[52:08] remember when I read these scriptures
[52:10] here to open up that her character not
[52:14] only as moabit was known but something
[52:17] much greater her character was already
[52:21] standing out in before the Reapers and
[52:24] it was standing out before Boaz
[52:27] Boaz was taking notice of her character
[52:30] and Boaz was already seeing something in
[52:33] her that Ruth couldn't see in herself it
[52:36] would be like a person that comes to
[52:38] know the Lord Jesus as their lord and
[52:40] savior what a wonderful reality what a
[52:43] wonderful moment to feel when we have
[52:46] repented and experienced the Forgiveness
[52:48] of our sins and that load that's lifted
[52:50] off for all of the past sins where
[52:53] they've been remitted but Ruth doesn't
[52:56] realize that who she's standing in the
[52:58] presence of is not only her savior but
[53:02] he's her
[53:03] Redeemer he's her Kinsman that's good
[53:06] she doesn't see this but what's
[53:08] important is he already sees as the
[53:10] prophet said he already saw the
[53:12] character that was in her and he already
[53:15] had in his mind what he was going to do
[53:18] and you would ask and say well why
[53:19] didn't Boaz just move and just do that
[53:22] because he has to allow all of these
[53:25] things to play out out and has to allow
[53:28] the character that he's already begin to
[53:30] see exhibited where she left Nativity
[53:33] left father and mother left her land and
[53:35] came with her mother-in-law he wants
[53:38] that character to come to a full
[53:41] expression because you see even in this
[53:43] hour we're living in God doesn't marry
[53:47] an infant bride but God marries a mature
[53:51] woman God marries one in whom the
[53:53] character he knew has laid there the
[53:56] whole time but under the presence his
[53:59] presence under his word he brings forth
[54:02] or harvests out of our life that
[54:06] character that has laid there the whole
[54:09] time that part of himself but what's
[54:13] important is in how God allows this to
[54:15] play out and and this obedience and
[54:18] obedience is is a is a is is the is the
[54:21] very Catalyst of getting God's attention
[54:24] and you really we we can't obey with
[54:26] without faith the Bible said he that
[54:28] cometh to God must first believe that he
[54:30] is and he's a rewarder of them that
[54:31] diligently seek him he goes on to say
[54:34] that how that that without faith it's
[54:36] impossible to please God so to
[54:39] understand that real obedience is simply
[54:41] just believing what God said it isn't
[54:43] about that I understand it or I can't
[54:45] explain it it's just simply saying Lord
[54:48] I take you at your word and you find
[54:50] that as we'll receive that just simple
[54:52] Faith because God has said it and we
[54:55] receive it obedience itself will work
[54:59] righteousness because there is a power
[55:03] in the word as we'll receive it it will
[55:06] change our lives from Glory unto
[55:10] glory and what an invitation she's had
[55:13] to come and fellowship with brothers and
[55:16] sisters of like Precious Faith what an
[55:19] opportunity she hasn't been invited by a
[55:22] Reaper this is one who has taken notice
[55:25] of her character character and has said
[55:27] at meal time I want you to come and I
[55:31] want you to come and to eat and and take
[55:33] nourishment with us I want you to come
[55:36] and be a a partaker of this and so when
[55:39] here she comes and we see the approach
[55:42] that's made what an invitation to to be
[55:44] to come and to dine with the king I I
[55:47] can't think of even a a greater reality
[55:50] of even when you think of how that the
[55:53] Lord Jesus in the resurrection he would
[55:55] speak to the disciples and here he was
[55:58] on the shore and when Peter realized who
[56:00] it was I mean he wasn't walking on water
[56:02] that time he just jumped in the water he
[56:04] said I'm out of the boat I'm swimming to
[56:06] shore I I want to get to where he's at
[56:09] and this is where the Lord Jesus they
[56:10] hauling the fish and he says come and
[56:13] dine and fish are provided upon the fire
[56:16] and I want you to notice he had it
[56:17] provided before they ever got the rest
[56:19] of the fish to the land God had already
[56:23] provided for them he he was showing
[56:25] these things and and then we we look at
[56:27] it when you take with Peter and and
[56:29] getting into this aspect of feeding and
[56:32] so forth and and you seen of how that
[56:34] the disciples remember they had become
[56:37] uh all scattered when they things were
[56:39] not going the way that they sh thought
[56:41] it should be but the chief Shepherd the
[56:43] Bible said you smite the shepherd
[56:45] scatter the Sheep but the shepherd
[56:47] himself is obligated to go and gather
[56:51] the Sheep Hallelujah and he goes and he
[56:54] begins to gather them and then he comes
[56:56] to Peter and he asked Peter as Peter
[56:59] sitting here eating and he said Peter do
[57:02] you love me now he's asking him do you
[57:04] Agape
[57:05] me that's
[57:09] unconditional and Peter says Lord thou
[57:11] knowest I ailo
[57:14] Thee and Jesus said feed my
[57:18] Lambs then this conversation it goes
[57:21] once again
[57:22] repeat the third time the Bible says p
[57:26] Peter is grieved yes that he's asked the
[57:30] same question
[57:34] again you say how could Peter be grieved
[57:37] because of the form of love he's still
[57:39] setting in you see when we come into
[57:42] this Earth the highest form of love that
[57:46] we can know and I think it's wonderful
[57:48] it's a it's a form of love that that
[57:50] should be about in our homes is FAL love
[57:54] but what should be the main driving
[57:57] force of our life is agape love and
[58:01] agape love is the Holy Ghost that's why
[58:04] Paul could say that the Holy Ghost is
[58:07] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[58:10] hearts by the Holy Ghost it's God that's
[58:12] what the Holy Spirit coming is is making
[58:15] known God's love for you what he did for
[58:18] you the way that's been made for you and
[58:20] you are always a part of him and God
[58:23] desires that you and I would serve him
[58:25] not not of oural love but of his love
[58:30] you see you and I could never get to
[58:32] Agape Love But agape love came down for
[58:35] you and I paid the price as he says the
[58:38] shepherd lays down his life for his
[58:41] sheep he made a way so that then that
[58:44] agape love coming into our lives now
[58:48] will be the influencer over our Fingal
[58:51] love cuz you still have Fingal love for
[58:54] your family yet Paul would write in the
[58:56] Ephesians 5 husbands Agape your wives
[58:58] even as Christ the church that's
[59:00] impossible without
[59:03] God 1 Corinthians 13 love is this and
[59:06] goes on and on that that cannot be
[59:08] attained to outside of God and US
[59:12] yielding to that love on the
[59:17] inside that's why when the Holy Ghost
[59:19] has come it it lifts it from just a a a
[59:22] h I'm doing this and I I this this is
[59:25] the right thing to do it it lifts it to
[59:27] where it's not even thought of as a
[59:29] obligation or a requirement it it's just
[59:32] it's a love affair right so the things
[59:34] that God has laid in your life and asked
[59:37] you to do it's like hey this is this is
[59:40] different than when I first started my
[59:41] journey it's it's not just me keeping
[59:43] away from things it's just Lord I I I
[59:46] just I want to please you see it's moved
[59:48] to a different depth because FAL love
[59:52] will fail you and I to try to serve God
[59:55] by FAL love the prophet will say it over
[59:57] and over and you see it FAL love when
[1:00:00] hard times come when pressures come FAL
[1:00:03] love doesn't have the strength to
[1:00:07] stand but agape love it has the strength
[1:00:12] because it's not based on our strength
[1:00:14] it's not based on the conditions of
[1:00:16] somebody else if somebody else is
[1:00:18] pleasing me or if there it's not it's an
[1:00:21] unconditional
[1:00:22] love yes sir you see that's is why we
[1:00:26] must have agape love to be the sole
[1:00:29] influence of our life that's why we must
[1:00:31] be born again and when the Lord Jesus is
[1:00:34] speaking to Peter here he's asking him
[1:00:37] three times feed my sheep now notice
[1:00:41] what he said to him feed my
[1:00:43] sheep he realizes when he's speaking to
[1:00:46] Peter Peter was still a selfish
[1:00:49] man Peter was still you we could go
[1:00:51] through events and I I don't have time
[1:00:53] to deal with that but what Jesus is
[1:00:54] letting it be known in is you you in the
[1:00:58] state that you're in now you're not able
[1:00:59] to feed my sheep you're not able to feed
[1:01:02] my Lambs you're not able to operate as
[1:01:05] as a as a as an unders sheeper you're
[1:01:07] not able to operate in that manner to
[1:01:09] actually feed because you're still too
[1:01:11] much wrapped up in
[1:01:14] Peter you see that's what the new birth
[1:01:16] is it delivers us of our own selfish
[1:01:22] will and it gives us a strength and a
[1:01:26] life and A Love Affair for God and for
[1:01:29] his word and for his people absolutely
[1:01:33] yes sir Hallelujah is that right it
[1:01:36] gives us a strength on the inside listen
[1:01:40] it's a strength like a garment where
[1:01:42] Paul could say put on therefore as the
[1:01:45] elect of God holy bows of Mercy put on
[1:01:47] means sink into sink into we've got a
[1:01:51] place we can Retreat a place we can let
[1:01:55] off the pressure a place that we can
[1:01:57] reside I'm not talking about out here
[1:01:59] I'm talking about in here we have a
[1:02:02] strength where the love of God and we
[1:02:05] can ask God lord I need
[1:02:08] more we should never don't ever be
[1:02:10] ashamed to ask God for more love when
[1:02:12] pressures come your way and situations
[1:02:15] tests trials whatever don't don't ever
[1:02:17] be ashamed to ask God for more love
[1:02:19] brother Samuel is that a sign that you
[1:02:21] know that I'm a weak Christian listen I
[1:02:24] would rather be weak as far is saying
[1:02:26] Lord I need you then be strong in my own
[1:02:29] self come on now that's right I want I
[1:02:33] want to be strong in the Lord and in the
[1:02:34] power of His
[1:02:37] might how Ruth must have felt to have
[1:02:40] been invited to this setting my but how
[1:02:45] that God would speak here not only with
[1:02:48] Peter on the feeding and I want you to
[1:02:49] take of take notice of these words even
[1:02:52] as if Paul would write when Paul could
[1:02:54] see his his getting ready to depart and
[1:02:57] Paul would write of this in the
[1:02:59] scriptures in the book of Acts and speak
[1:03:01] of how I'm getting ready to depart from
[1:03:03] you but he said I want you he called the
[1:03:06] elders he called them to him there and
[1:03:09] he told him he says I want you to take
[1:03:10] heed to yourselves first and to the
[1:03:14] flock of God now notice how the order is
[1:03:16] to yourselves first and then to the
[1:03:19] flock of God you see uh even for a
[1:03:21] shepherd and this applies even when it
[1:03:24] comes husband father and whatever more
[1:03:26] we we see this even as we talk about the
[1:03:28] token we can never actually be
[1:03:31] effectually and work as in the operation
[1:03:34] or the or the position or what God wants
[1:03:36] us to do if we and ourselves are not
[1:03:39] taking heed to ourselves so at first of
[1:03:41] all Paul is speaking to the elders take
[1:03:44] heed to yourselves and to the flock so
[1:03:46] to be mindful of the flock over which
[1:03:49] the Lord hath made you overseers because
[1:03:53] you see any man that just makes himself
[1:03:55] and I'm talking about a man that just
[1:03:57] feels like you know well I you know what
[1:03:59] I I just can't sit under anybody else I
[1:04:02] I need to go start my own worker I need
[1:04:04] to go do that I tell you that's a
[1:04:05] dangerous situation to be in you say why
[1:04:08] because that Foundation is already wrong
[1:04:10] it's for the wrong purpose if there's a
[1:04:13] group that is to start it should be
[1:04:15] birthed out of or grow from it should be
[1:04:18] of a burden that begins there in that
[1:04:21] heart why that's for the Sheep cuz if
[1:04:23] it's not that same motive and objective
[1:04:26] even though that word's being preached
[1:04:28] Spirits attach to the word and what it
[1:04:31] does if a group if something is started
[1:04:34] under bitterness you watch there'll be a
[1:04:36] bitterness that starts there that's
[1:04:37] every denomination it's a bitterness
[1:04:40] against God's word so it matters what
[1:04:42] the motive is behind it so when we look
[1:04:45] at this take heed to yourselves and to
[1:04:48] the flock of God over which the Lord
[1:04:50] hath made thee overseer and to feed the
[1:04:53] flock of God once again this word feed
[1:04:57] the flock of God now when you think of
[1:04:59] this to to feed the prophet would tell
[1:05:02] us like this when it comes to feeding
[1:05:04] and I'm talking about Meal Time and
[1:05:05] notice how Ruth is gathering in with all
[1:05:08] of the Reapers this isn't just Ruth
[1:05:10] coming to a little shed by herself and
[1:05:12] Ruth getting in there and there's
[1:05:13] already some meal that's provided no
[1:05:16] coming together with the rest of us at
[1:05:18] meal time now notice this testing is
[1:05:20] being done here and when you find that
[1:05:23] how the prophet would speak about of now
[1:05:25] that the ministry is to work he said God
[1:05:28] God does not send man to rule over man
[1:05:31] but remember Paul said in the book of of
[1:05:34] Hebrews chapter 3 you know 13 we always
[1:05:37] remember verse 8 but verse 7 says
[1:05:39] remember them that have the rule over
[1:05:41] you whose Faith follow considering the
[1:05:45] end of their conversation so in other
[1:05:48] words when we're looking at it it should
[1:05:50] be that faith that revelation we should
[1:05:52] see Christ and it should be Christ that
[1:05:55] we're following sure God uses men but
[1:05:58] the men the way God will use that man is
[1:06:00] a gift he's placed in that man's life to
[1:06:03] be able to get himself out of the way to
[1:06:05] get his thoughts out of the way and to
[1:06:07] depend on the leading of the chief
[1:06:09] Shepherd because every Pastor is a
[1:06:12] Shepherd but he's not the chief Shepherd
[1:06:15] the pastor is an Under Shepherd there's
[1:06:18] the chief Shepherd and the chief
[1:06:20] Shepherd is over all of that he's the
[1:06:22] one who's guiding and directing the UND
[1:06:25] sheeper words so that there is a flow
[1:06:27] and we're moving in the right and the
[1:06:29] same direction and the prophet would
[1:06:31] tell us that how that we are LED he said
[1:06:34] we we are LED as we feed on the word of
[1:06:37] God that's how God leads his church as
[1:06:41] we feed on the word of God now when you
[1:06:44] consider that and look at you think
[1:06:46] about it even in the terms of when you
[1:06:49] we think of Psalms 23 David would say
[1:06:51] the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not
[1:06:54] want he make me to lie down in Green
[1:06:57] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[1:07:00] Waters uh he anointed my head with oil
[1:07:03] my cup runneth over you know if I don't
[1:07:05] know how you thought about it but you
[1:07:07] know there's things as you begin to look
[1:07:09] at that he maketh me to lie down in
[1:07:11] Green Pastures it would almost seem as
[1:07:13] though that a sheep is being brought
[1:07:15] into a place like this and from and from
[1:07:18] wall to wall is Lush thick grass but
[1:07:22] that is not at all according to Psalms
[1:07:24] 23 in the Eastern custom as a matter of
[1:07:27] fact the shepherd himself there are
[1:07:29] there are places that the Sheep will
[1:07:32] feed in certain seasons of the year the
[1:07:35] ultimate or the desire of every Shepherd
[1:07:37] is to be able to get the Sheep up to the
[1:07:39] table land and that table land will be a
[1:07:42] summer's worth of Journey but in order
[1:07:45] for the Sheep to go on that Journey the
[1:07:47] shepherd goes ahead of the sheep he
[1:07:49] clears out debris out of the Springs he
[1:07:52] removes that and the shepherd is able to
[1:07:54] move any hindrances out of the pathway
[1:07:57] cuz it's a rugged way that rugged way up
[1:07:59] to the table land which is a wonderful
[1:08:01] place where we can just lay down and and
[1:08:04] settle down right there wonderful place
[1:08:06] but in order to get there there's a lot
[1:08:08] of lot of hard tracks along the way but
[1:08:11] as there's hard tracks there is also
[1:08:14] sufficient nutrients in Plants along the
[1:08:17] way you see the Shepherd in the East
[1:08:20] knows like this in Psalms 23 knows how
[1:08:22] the Dew Falls what side of the mountain
[1:08:25] it falls on even in the season and when
[1:08:27] that Dew will fall upon that it knows
[1:08:30] what certain plants will come out within
[1:08:32] that time and it knows how to lead those
[1:08:35] sheep it also knows the the kinds of
[1:08:37] things that the Sheep do not need to
[1:08:39] partake of they have to watch out for
[1:08:41] certain plants that are there you know
[1:08:43] Paul said don't do not get entangled in
[1:08:45] YouTube I mean in Endless genealogies
[1:08:48] don't get entangled in things like that
[1:08:51] cuz it ain't going to benefit you you
[1:08:52] know why good would it to you to do
[1:08:54] today after you get out of church and
[1:08:56] you're hungry and you go feed in a
[1:08:58] garbage can why would you want to do
[1:08:59] that I just want to stay and feed in the
[1:09:01] things of God oh brother Samuel I want
[1:09:03] to know the points I want to I don't
[1:09:05] want to argue the word was not meant to
[1:09:07] debate the word was meant to Beed as a
[1:09:10] matter of fact the prophet tells us
[1:09:12] there in the church ages he said the
[1:09:14] reason that the word did not have the
[1:09:16] effect that it should in the days of
[1:09:18] Luther he said is because men studied it
[1:09:21] for mere learning and did not give thems
[1:09:25] to the word that it might have a
[1:09:27] practical outworking in their lives I
[1:09:30] don't want to do that I want this word
[1:09:33] to be made
[1:09:35] flesh so all along the way God help us
[1:09:37] to know as the do where is the D falling
[1:09:40] because the do remember God never
[1:09:42] promised Jacob the firstborn was never
[1:09:46] promised big massive Reigns but part of
[1:09:48] the Covenant was you'll have the do from
[1:09:50] Heaven Hallelujah I appreciate rigns
[1:09:53] don't you but you get very hard r it'll
[1:09:55] just be run off but real Dew will settle
[1:09:59] in to the ground real Dew will settle in
[1:10:02] and take away you can take a plant it
[1:10:04] could be a hard rain man that plant
[1:10:06] needs water but if it's a hard rain if
[1:10:08] that ground is not in condition to
[1:10:10] receive that rain when it comes it'll
[1:10:12] run right off and that plant you know
[1:10:15] what that plant begins to do this is why
[1:10:17] they tell you when you buy plants water
[1:10:19] them deep and the way you water them
[1:10:20] deep is with slow dripping water and it
[1:10:23] causes the roots to go down down down to
[1:10:27] seek that water if you just water a tree
[1:10:30] or a shrub and you just simply and
[1:10:33] watered in like that it causes the roots
[1:10:35] to just stay on the surface because it
[1:10:37] knows there's a lot of water on the
[1:10:39] surface then when it comes hard times
[1:10:41] when it's time to draw oh my when the
[1:10:43] hot times comes it's just used where
[1:10:45] where's that surface water at but when
[1:10:47] it is guided notice what the water is to
[1:10:50] do not only is the water to provide
[1:10:53] nourishment but it's to lead the roots
[1:10:56] to the Unseen source of water that's
[1:10:59] beneath it oh don't you thank God for
[1:11:02] that so as a Shepherd a Shepherd is
[1:11:05] there to and under the leading of the
[1:11:08] Holy Spirit he's there to watch out for
[1:11:10] many things to serving the body to watch
[1:11:13] out for enemies and watch out and defend
[1:11:16] the sheep from attackers and heal the
[1:11:18] wounded and sick and M you know when you
[1:11:21] get to studying on Like a Shepherd
[1:11:23] remember David carried a little grip bag
[1:11:25] and as he would carry that if they one
[1:11:27] got sick he'd put that honey on the Rock
[1:11:29] and knowing what was in that rock is
[1:11:31] what they needed but remember a sheep
[1:11:33] ain't just going to go over and lick on
[1:11:34] a rock you got to sweeten it up a little
[1:11:36] bit and God knows exactly how to sweeten
[1:11:39] things up oh sometimes there's things
[1:11:41] that's just so hard and cutting but God
[1:11:43] knows how to sweeten it by his presence
[1:11:46] that we might lick on that and gather
[1:11:49] the nutrients minerals that we have need
[1:11:52] of in our life and all of that that has
[1:11:55] to be mindful of as well now when I
[1:11:58] think of this this character that Boaz
[1:12:01] has seen within her he's reached her the
[1:12:04] parched corn I I want you to notice on
[1:12:07] that scripture if we could just read
[1:12:09] that scripture one more time it says in
[1:12:12] verse 14 of Ruth 2 Boaz said unto her at
[1:12:15] meal time this is more grace being
[1:12:17] extended at Meal Time Come Thou hither
[1:12:21] and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel
[1:12:23] in the vinegar and she sat beside the
[1:12:25] Reapers now how's she going to know when
[1:12:26] it's Meal Time Well evidently there
[1:12:28] would be something it would notify her
[1:12:31] at meal time now notice bohas never told
[1:12:33] her I'm going to come get you at Meal
[1:12:35] Time matter of fact I'm going to send
[1:12:37] out an escort you don't have to walk
[1:12:38] that way uh you don't have to walk up to
[1:12:40] the house of where it's at I'm going to
[1:12:42] make everything no he could have done
[1:12:44] that but you see if he had done that it
[1:12:47] would not have further released the
[1:12:49] character that he already saw that was
[1:12:52] there you see remember Paul saw the
[1:12:55] faith in Abraham but James said the
[1:12:58] people will see your faith by the works
[1:13:01] that's expressed on the inside oh my so
[1:13:04] whatever notice he he could have done
[1:13:06] that for Ruth but he didn't do it
[1:13:08] remember this is all part of her there
[1:13:10] will be many other tests as we'll look
[1:13:12] at in coming Services there are tests
[1:13:14] that are throughout this entirety of
[1:13:17] this chapter of where she is tested and
[1:13:19] all of these Temptations and things that
[1:13:21] are around her but remember God is Not
[1:13:24] Afraid afid to allow his children to be
[1:13:28] tested God ain't afraid of it no sir
[1:13:31] he's not afraid to let testing comes
[1:13:33] even according to the measure that we're
[1:13:36] able to withstand in this hour and even
[1:13:38] in that we don't feel like we can
[1:13:40] withstand what God brings on us but
[1:13:42] God's Got Confidence in where the word
[1:13:43] is working in our life currently that's
[1:13:46] good is that right now notice this Boaz
[1:13:49] reaches her parched corn now notice as
[1:13:51] it comes in it says right here in the
[1:13:53] scripture she sat down beside the
[1:13:55] Reapers she did not walk in there and
[1:13:57] say hey hey hey y'all just sit back over
[1:14:00] here and I'm just going to come right
[1:14:02] down watch such humility she sits down
[1:14:06] beside the Reapers notice this is
[1:14:09] receiving of real Grace it's humility
[1:14:13] that's what coming to the house of God
[1:14:14] should be it should be reverence respect
[1:14:18] humility remember when Isaiah came in
[1:14:20] the temple he saw this it brought him
[1:14:23] into these places to do what respect the
[1:14:26] word of God CU we really can't have
[1:14:27] respect for one another unless we
[1:14:29] respect God right we can't have that
[1:14:32] reverence we can't have that worship we
[1:14:34] can't have that humility in the right
[1:14:35] way it all stems from that walk with God
[1:14:38] now her humility of setting down beside
[1:14:41] the reacher the the Reapers and how he
[1:14:43] would reach her parch corn not like what
[1:14:45] you and I maybe you know when you read
[1:14:47] the scripture sometimes you might just
[1:14:49] think well it's just corn that's been
[1:14:50] roasted this is barley season it's
[1:14:52] resurrection power and what is has taken
[1:14:55] place this grain that Boaz himself
[1:14:58] planted has come to full maturity this
[1:15:00] grain itself has already been waved you
[1:15:03] know there's already been a wave sheath
[1:15:04] went over and that grain itself is grain
[1:15:07] that's come out of that field now with
[1:15:09] that grain that's come out of that field
[1:15:11] he didn't just serve her raw grain nor
[1:15:13] was it just grain that had been blanched
[1:15:16] but it was grain that had went through
[1:15:18] that of harvest been gleaned been
[1:15:20] shooked out and then it had actually
[1:15:22] been you know beat out and brought into
[1:15:25] a cake with some aromatic herbs that
[1:15:27] would then be presented to her in a in a
[1:15:30] way and you know what it was it was to
[1:15:32] let her know there is more for width of
[1:15:35] this where this is coming from remember
[1:15:38] she was not doing this on her own accord
[1:15:41] she did not have the ability she was not
[1:15:43] in that position but her at that time
[1:15:46] she was in a position to Simply receive
[1:15:50] what Boaz was providing oh God may we
[1:15:53] ever stay in that kind of a position may
[1:15:55] we never get to a place that we're
[1:15:57] telling our Boaz you do this and I need
[1:16:00] this because if we do that sure is the
[1:16:02] world we cannot be the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:04] Christ and telling our husband what to
[1:16:07] do and what not to do that's what God
[1:16:09] Esther put away is that right now notice
[1:16:11] this in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and
[1:16:14] verse 13 Paul would write of this you
[1:16:17] know in admonishing the Thessalonians he
[1:16:19] would say uh for this cause also thank
[1:16:22] we god without ceasing because when when
[1:16:25] you received the word of God which you
[1:16:27] heard of us now notice when you received
[1:16:30] the word of God which you heard of us ye
[1:16:34] received it not as the word of men but
[1:16:38] as it is in truth the word of God which
[1:16:42] effectually worketh also in you that
[1:16:46] belief now notice taking taking that
[1:16:49] word you know I want to be a feeder God
[1:16:51] has not called me here this morning or
[1:16:53] he's not called you either to be a
[1:16:55] sorter you ever seen people that you
[1:16:57] know sometimes you ever watch them
[1:16:58] little videos where they're sorting the
[1:16:59] fish out and they you know this fish and
[1:17:01] that's bad you know they're sorting them
[1:17:03] out sorting them out sorting them out
[1:17:04] get rid of this one get rid of that one
[1:17:05] let that one pass let this God ain't
[1:17:07] called us to be sorters do we need
[1:17:09] discernment we do need discernment cuz
[1:17:11] I'll tell you I've never preached a
[1:17:13] perfect sermon in my life there is
[1:17:15] elements of man that's in there but God
[1:17:17] has not called you nor me nor anybody
[1:17:20] else to sit here and be a sorter you can
[1:17:23] sort all day long and it's just on your
[1:17:26] own accord and not be a feeder when I
[1:17:29] leave out of here I want sustenance
[1:17:32] within my soul I want to know that I've
[1:17:35] been in the presence of God and there is
[1:17:37] word but not just I've had a snack or an
[1:17:40] AER I want to feed on the things of
[1:17:43] almighty God I am purposed and intending
[1:17:47] and believing that God is going to speak
[1:17:50] to my
[1:17:53] needs oh God help us
[1:17:55] to receive that word to effectually work
[1:18:00] in our lives cuz that word has power
[1:18:02] within it it don't stop it don't stop
[1:18:04] when you receive the word as that word
[1:18:06] comes into your life it's like brother
[1:18:08] bam talking about those who was taking
[1:18:09] that uh uh I can't remember the name of
[1:18:11] that metal now he speaks up and spoken
[1:18:13] words Original Seed that that that one
[1:18:15] that's really toxic I don't know if it's
[1:18:17] uranium I can't remember what it was and
[1:18:18] they were you know putting it on that
[1:18:20] that you know on those watch hands
[1:18:21] before and they were you know they would
[1:18:23] lick that brush and dip it down there
[1:18:24] cuz you got to get the brush real fine
[1:18:26] and when they did that they found out
[1:18:28] all of these people that worked in that
[1:18:30] plan they died and when they died they
[1:18:33] died from that poisoning of that metal
[1:18:35] they were painting on those watch hands
[1:18:37] he said and they found out after those
[1:18:39] people died he said that steel when they
[1:18:42] would take one of their skulls take the
[1:18:44] bones they would find that ticking going
[1:18:47] off from that metal oh he said how the
[1:18:49] word of God that has been spoken and
[1:18:52] circled and circled the Earth it will
[1:18:54] move down into hearts and that same word
[1:18:57] that we receive oh God it has life
[1:19:00] within it there's a womb a ground that
[1:19:03] can receive that word it will produce
[1:19:06] just exactly what God
[1:19:09] Said now what's this
[1:19:13] effect Brethren you became
[1:19:15] followers of the churches of God which
[1:19:19] are in
[1:19:20] Judea that are in Christ Jesus now not
[1:19:24] just
[1:19:25] churches but churches that that local
[1:19:29] locality but that are in Christ Jesus
[1:19:32] they're walking in present
[1:19:35] truth it's it's the word that God has
[1:19:38] revealed in this hour because you see if
[1:19:41] I were to preach any other message it
[1:19:43] won't take effect on you if you're real
[1:19:46] bride seed it won't take effect on you
[1:19:49] but let me just go ahead and say this
[1:19:51] even if there's lives that are not bride
[1:19:53] seed that will set here all the way
[1:19:56] through the Rapture if you will
[1:19:58] determine in your heart I do not want to
[1:20:01] go to hell I want to serve God I want to
[1:20:04] reverence his word the whole time now
[1:20:06] you don't know whether you are or not
[1:20:08] but I'll tell you one thing I you don't
[1:20:10] have to go to hell if you don't want to
[1:20:13] God don't send nobody to
[1:20:16] hell is that right like God told Kain
[1:20:19] Kain you'll not be any different but if
[1:20:20] you'll do what you see and know to be
[1:20:24] the truth
[1:20:25] I will accept
[1:20:30] you but notice this is why the prophet
[1:20:33] would talk about even over and over I
[1:20:35] I've got these quotes but I I don't want
[1:20:37] to read them I I just want to refer to
[1:20:38] him and he would speak of how when when
[1:20:40] when trophies would come to the Altar
[1:20:43] and he would Min mention you know to the
[1:20:45] people find a good church home he said
[1:20:48] find a good church home and be baptized
[1:20:51] in Christian baptism and receive the
[1:20:53] Holy Ghost and live a Godly life
[1:20:55] thereafter he would say find a good Holy
[1:20:58] Ghost filled church and go to it and
[1:21:01] seek his baptism now watch this don't
[1:21:04] just go to church but seek his baptism
[1:21:08] until you found it go every day every
[1:21:10] night just keep praying why I want to
[1:21:13] know him
[1:21:15] fully so when we we're talking about
[1:21:18] this of even going to church I don't
[1:21:20] want you to think of it and look at it
[1:21:22] when you see here feeding and fell oh
[1:21:24] that that's just going to church no that
[1:21:25] that's not the correct way to look at
[1:21:27] that when we're talking about going to
[1:21:28] church reading quotes about being in the
[1:21:30] house of God there's a reason there is a
[1:21:33] feeding that is to take place where God
[1:21:37] the chief Shepherd will lead us into the
[1:21:40] places that we need to be feeding and it
[1:21:42] doesn't even stop when the preacher
[1:21:44] stops that's right Hallelujah you with
[1:21:48] me Hallelujah we need him friends
[1:21:52] remember Jude said there were some who
[1:21:54] were feeding themselves without fear in
[1:21:56] other words they were their own
[1:21:57] Shepherds they didn't need they didn't I
[1:21:59] don't need that they were their own
[1:22:01] Shepherds then we had those in the book
[1:22:03] of Corinthians that had their
[1:22:05] preferences well I like paulus I like
[1:22:08] Peter AR sephus I like this and then
[1:22:10] there were those who were just I'm of
[1:22:12] Christ I'm better than all of y'all I'm
[1:22:14] of Christ you see such the carnality
[1:22:18] that can get in there to recognize it's
[1:22:20] not
[1:22:21] man it's not man this is why friends I I
[1:22:26] I'll tell you I I I long for the day I I
[1:22:28] think we should be there but I realize
[1:22:30] we've got a way to go I long for the day
[1:22:33] to where personalities are no longer
[1:22:38] worshiped Hall I long for the day when
[1:22:42] it's no longer for this man and putting
[1:22:44] this up and putting that and people
[1:22:46] flocking in and flocking for this listen
[1:22:49] friends we ought to be coming for the
[1:22:50] right thing but let me say this to you
[1:22:52] you can meet God one onone in your own
[1:22:56] life in your own prayer closet yes sir
[1:22:59] yes sir hallu yes sir oh God help us
[1:23:04] because it's not man it's God who works
[1:23:07] through the office of a man now watch
[1:23:10] are his gifts that he has there remember
[1:23:12] God's desire even as he would say within
[1:23:15] this look in 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 1
[1:23:18] where even when the writing of the new
[1:23:21] newborns where Paul would or Peter would
[1:23:23] write lay us IDE all malice and all G
[1:23:27] and hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[1:23:30] speakings and as newborn babes desire
[1:23:33] the sincere milk of the word that you
[1:23:36] may grow thereby and if so be you have
[1:23:38] tasted that the Lord is gracious so God
[1:23:41] gives us strength this milk that we're
[1:23:43] talking of we all have had our time of
[1:23:45] starting with milk is that right right
[1:23:49] and depending on sometimes how that we
[1:23:51] will go about things God may have to say
[1:23:53] we need to go go back and visit some
[1:23:55] milk right
[1:23:58] now sometimes God has to do that but you
[1:24:00] see God knows what plants that we have
[1:24:02] need of he knows the nutrients that we
[1:24:05] have need of in our lives and God also
[1:24:08] knows that we are and mindful that we
[1:24:10] are but flesh now within that there's a
[1:24:13] desire we need the milk of the word
[1:24:15] notice the desire that God has for our
[1:24:17] life is that we would grow think of how
[1:24:20] the prophet would stand there in the
[1:24:21] message taking sides with Jesus
[1:24:23] preaching to a group of Brethren and
[1:24:26] he's speaking to them there at home and
[1:24:28] he would speak and express his heart's
[1:24:29] desire oh how I wish that I had Outpost
[1:24:33] over there in India Africa those places
[1:24:36] he said when multitudes have come to the
[1:24:39] Lord I wish I had somewhere to send them
[1:24:42] to he said instead he said many of them
[1:24:45] he said never go on at all with God in
[1:24:48] any way he said they have old dead
[1:24:50] formal churches they have nothing that
[1:24:52] can cultivate and further than walk
[1:24:54] along with God my that was the prophet's
[1:24:59] burden that there would be
[1:25:02] Outpost places where the Sheep of God
[1:25:05] decisions he said decisions when a man
[1:25:08] has accepted Christ then by the sword of
[1:25:12] the word cut them into Sons and
[1:25:15] Daughters of God like in Michaelangelo
[1:25:19] took and removed everything that was not
[1:25:22] Moses
[1:25:25] oh God what a what a word now notice
[1:25:28] this in Hebrews 10 these are this is
[1:25:30] familiar scriptures to us in Hebrews
[1:25:32] chapter 10 notice how Paul would write
[1:25:34] this let us hold fast the profession of
[1:25:37] our faith without wavering for he is
[1:25:40] faithful that promised let us watch how
[1:25:43] he writes this consider that means being
[1:25:46] thoughtful of attentive to one another
[1:25:50] to provoke unto love and to Good Works
[1:25:55] my the next verse we're familiar with
[1:25:58] this not forsaking the assembling of
[1:26:01] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:26:05] is but exhorting one another and so much
[1:26:09] the more as you see the day approaching
[1:26:11] now Paul was not saying exhorting one
[1:26:13] another hey you need to be in the house
[1:26:14] of God hey no the exhorting is as we
[1:26:17] come together Paul knowing that in this
[1:26:20] walk we get discouraged there might be
[1:26:23] one that's disc courage one that might
[1:26:25] feel lower than this carpet but as they
[1:26:28] come and say God despite my
[1:26:31] discouragement I'm going to come and
[1:26:33] notice how do we meet Jesus we meet him
[1:26:36] in one
[1:26:38] another we meet him and one another
[1:26:41] remember when Paul was on the road there
[1:26:44] to Damascus and he says and here the
[1:26:47] light smites him down he said who are
[1:26:49] you Lord he said I'm Jesus whom thou
[1:26:53] persecutest what was it the Corporal
[1:26:55] body had already ascended sent back the
[1:26:59] Holy Ghost and it was Jesus meeting in a
[1:27:02] body of Believers that's why the prophet
[1:27:05] could say in why Christ speak 1963 he
[1:27:08] said Jesus goes to church Jesus he said
[1:27:11] goes to church every day he goes to
[1:27:14] church in his people and
[1:27:18] worships
[1:27:20] woo my Hallelujah why you are the real
[1:27:24] house of
[1:27:25] prayer you are a place of
[1:27:28] communion where the master can come and
[1:27:31] lay his head and disclose his desires
[1:27:35] and he's not laughed at he's not
[1:27:37] ridiculed he's not said ah we don't need
[1:27:39] that but he's embraced he's
[1:27:47] welcomed not forsaking which means to
[1:27:51] abandon leaving Straits leave helpless
[1:27:56] just to totally abandon now notice
[1:27:59] within this part of it this is why when
[1:28:03] the prophet would tell us over and over
[1:28:05] in places in the message I I referred to
[1:28:07] a few of them one of the other plac he
[1:28:09] said he says if you don't have a church
[1:28:11] you must because if you don't you'll die
[1:28:15] spiritually you'll dwindle away you know
[1:28:18] what he's talking about listen to me now
[1:28:20] listen I'm talking about if you can
[1:28:22] apply this correctly it's not it's not
[1:28:25] just to have a church home to say what
[1:28:27] I'm associated with but it's a place of
[1:28:31] feeding it's a place where you can hear
[1:28:35] the chief Shepherd speaking to you where
[1:28:38] he's leading you he's ministering to you
[1:28:42] he's speaking lip to ear to you he knows
[1:28:46] you he knows your life Jesus said I know
[1:28:49] my sheep by name he knows our character
[1:28:54] he knows all about us he don't try to
[1:28:57] change us he don't try to make Paul like
[1:28:58] Zachary Zachary like Aaron Aaron God
[1:29:00] don't want that God don't want he he
[1:29:01] wanted that he'd created it that
[1:29:04] way God don't run a serious and hard
[1:29:06] robu Harmony House are you with me I
[1:29:10] don't want to have to quote quote a
[1:29:11] bunch of quotes but I'm pulling from
[1:29:12] quotes when I'm saying that God don't
[1:29:15] God's not interested in your temperament
[1:29:17] being like my
[1:29:18] temperament God's not in that's not the
[1:29:21] change the change that God comes to do
[1:29:24] is the change on the inside and then he
[1:29:26] equips that life on the inside with
[1:29:29] Divine love that's able to submit itself
[1:29:33] and its character be molded to match the
[1:29:38] word
[1:29:42] hallelujah but just you see this is why
[1:29:44] many times I I think of it every time I
[1:29:46] encourage with young people places
[1:29:49] depending on you know sometimes I've
[1:29:51] been there and and ministered within a
[1:29:52] closing service maybe a Clos closing
[1:29:54] night service or it's been the closing
[1:29:56] morning service and I I move with some
[1:29:58] instruction and Direction and a lot of
[1:29:59] times the brothers will follow that
[1:30:01] evening with some of that and one of the
[1:30:03] things that's mentioned within there is
[1:30:04] to realize as like you remember brother
[1:30:06] bam called it he said many times people
[1:30:08] just get Campground crank camps cramps
[1:30:11] that everything on the campground but
[1:30:12] once the campground's over with hey I
[1:30:14] love those atmospheres those are
[1:30:16] important those are necessary those are
[1:30:18] needful but God never intended for you
[1:30:19] and I to live under camp meeting
[1:30:21] atmosphere all the time
[1:30:24] that's right I can't preach that to you
[1:30:27] today but but you see you say brother
[1:30:28] Samuel you talking about we're not to
[1:30:30] have joy who yes we are to have joy
[1:30:32] friends listen I have just as much joy
[1:30:34] when I'm in a meeting when I've been in
[1:30:36] a meeting or when I'm walking down and
[1:30:38] I'm cutting my hydrus back I got
[1:30:41] joy because you want to know why your
[1:30:43] roots should not be just shallow am
[1:30:46] waiting for the next Revival oh I've got
[1:30:49] to wait for the next meeting no it's get
[1:30:52] into Christ and let your roots go so
[1:30:55] deep that no matter how dry it is around
[1:30:58] you you found a hidden Source whose
[1:31:01] leaves do not
[1:31:03] wither blessed is that man
[1:31:09] hallu but you see it's just this is why
[1:31:12] the instruction would come feed your
[1:31:14] experience because I don't know no other
[1:31:17] minister
[1:31:19] knows or so and so this no they we
[1:31:22] encourage everyone no matter where
[1:31:23] you're Brad feed your experience that
[1:31:25] God has given
[1:31:26] you well brother the time you maybe it
[1:31:28] hasn't went all the way down well Feed
[1:31:30] The Experience God has touched you made
[1:31:33] you aware of and maybe you were going a
[1:31:36] million miles the other way and God
[1:31:38] turned you right around and made you
[1:31:40] aware I ain't lost sight of you you are
[1:31:44] mine I'm talking about right in here
[1:31:46] that God would deal with that don't just
[1:31:48] walk out of the service and say glory to
[1:31:50] God God hadn't forgotten about me feed
[1:31:53] that
[1:31:55] experience don't neglect to
[1:32:01] feed my Lord have
[1:32:04] mercy now watch this watch this quote
[1:32:06] out of thirsting for Life brother BR
[1:32:09] says you watch this
[1:32:11] deer I I want to read this one to you he
[1:32:13] said it gets out to itself and away from
[1:32:14] the herd and that's the one the
[1:32:17] wolf works on now watch the Sheep gets
[1:32:20] out to itself it wasn't LED that way
[1:32:23] right it wasn't LED that way but it gets
[1:32:26] off on its own you know sometimes before
[1:32:30] a sheep ever gets off on its own it's
[1:32:32] still Gathering right here but it's
[1:32:34] already gathering on its
[1:32:36] own right in here because remember it it
[1:32:39] really ain't about it's not about this
[1:32:41] this is simply something you've got to
[1:32:43] bring in obedience this is something
[1:32:45] that simply at times brother Samuel
[1:32:47] there times that you don't feel like
[1:32:48] coming to church are you kidding me
[1:32:50] there's times I don't feel like
[1:32:51] preaching there's times I don't feel
[1:32:53] like studying I don't feel feel like
[1:32:54] praying sometimes I don't feel like
[1:32:55] dealing with problems I don't feel like
[1:32:57] it but you know what when I when I don't
[1:33:00] feel like it in that I'm not going to
[1:33:01] let this flesh I'm not putting me up
[1:33:03] listen to me I'm letting you know the
[1:33:05] man that's preaching to you goes through
[1:33:07] battles that's right that's right and
[1:33:10] any man that tells you he doesn't he's a
[1:33:11] liar that's right you go through
[1:33:15] battles before you can ever listen
[1:33:17] there's things now I can go right
[1:33:18] through and listen to the message of the
[1:33:20] hour and I can tell you brother Brams
[1:33:22] went through this went through this went
[1:33:24] through this went through this and he's
[1:33:25] not even saying it but I know
[1:33:27] it because it's experiences it isn't
[1:33:31] just getting up and quoting a bunch of
[1:33:32] scriptures and a bunch of quotes it's
[1:33:36] experiences oh my when he preaches grest
[1:33:40] battle ever fought he's not just
[1:33:41] preaching something and just looking at
[1:33:44] it he is preaching to you and I
[1:33:47] experiences that he's went through when
[1:33:49] he talks about Abraham an old spooky
[1:33:52] Spirit getting around him but Abraham
[1:33:55] would take the sword and cut that thing
[1:33:58] cut that thing cut that thing cut that
[1:34:00] thing he said he would poke a little
[1:34:02] hole then he said the hole get bigger
[1:34:04] brother brandom is preaching by
[1:34:08] experience sir you know what that is
[1:34:10] that's the chief Shepherd that has
[1:34:12] allowed an UND sheeper Hallelujah to
[1:34:15] come and experience the pathway that you
[1:34:18] and I can look at this pathway and say
[1:34:20] thank you
[1:34:21] Lord I know I'm odd but I'm not that odd
[1:34:24] I'm still I am redeemed of the Lord
[1:34:27] these feelings that I have that's not
[1:34:28] who I am but I thank God for the word
[1:34:31] that's come that I can feed
[1:34:37] upon huh oh he says but that old man he
[1:34:41] says notice that W that wolf will work
[1:34:43] on you and you old man or
[1:34:47] woman when you separate yourself from
[1:34:50] Believers now notice when you separate
[1:34:53] your self from
[1:34:55] Believers not Believers separating from
[1:34:57] you when
[1:35:02] you like brother Andrew said just buckle
[1:35:04] up your seat belts a
[1:35:06] minute this is for our good friends but
[1:35:08] I want you to I this is what I want you
[1:35:10] to hear the words this is where I want
[1:35:12] you to hear the words feed my sheep feed
[1:35:14] my Lambs feed the flock it's about
[1:35:17] feeding when we're coming to the house
[1:35:19] of God there's two parts to it feeding
[1:35:22] and fellowship
[1:35:24] amen I'm just coming to feet no you're
[1:35:27] missing another key part don't forsake
[1:35:29] to assemble yourselves together remember
[1:35:33] God wasn't going to send down a taxi
[1:35:35] Uber
[1:35:37] lft whatever those things are he wasn't
[1:35:39] going to send one of those autonomous
[1:35:40] vehicles down hey Ruth don't worry don't
[1:35:42] worry don't worry you don't have to
[1:35:45] sacrifice there's no pressure you don't
[1:35:46] have to hey I I I I'll make it easy
[1:35:49] right no at Meal Time come
[1:35:54] see she's got to show she had it's a
[1:35:57] demonstrating it's not her well I got to
[1:35:58] do this noce he's he's drawing he's
[1:36:00] allowing that character to come out and
[1:36:02] even when now she gets into his presence
[1:36:05] she'll sit down humbly beside the
[1:36:09] Reapers and he reaches parch
[1:36:11] corn you know God won't get us out of
[1:36:14] bed on Sunday
[1:36:17] mornings God don't come around and smack
[1:36:20] our feet and say hey hey hey hey come on
[1:36:22] it's time to assemble that's right God
[1:36:24] won't do you know there's things in his
[1:36:26] word that God will not do for you and I
[1:36:29] he'll open the Red Sea cuz you can't do
[1:36:31] that
[1:36:32] right right God God entrusts things to
[1:36:36] you and I to
[1:36:37] do even in your giving and thing God
[1:36:39] don't do that God trust you and I notice
[1:36:43] where Paul wrote Don't forsake
[1:36:45] yourselves right assembling together lot
[1:36:49] of different reasons and factors within
[1:36:51] that can I have just a few more moments
[1:36:57] he says people can
[1:36:58] say I can stay at home and be just as
[1:37:02] good a Christian as I can at
[1:37:05] church you can't I want you to notice
[1:37:08] there's key there's key words in there
[1:37:12] I I I can now I know probably in this
[1:37:17] quote right here we'd like to have the
[1:37:18] hyphenated version and have it in small
[1:37:21] print maybe marginal print
[1:37:24] but
[1:37:25] streaming streaming has its part and
[1:37:29] listen there's different ones that even
[1:37:32] stream
[1:37:35] here but if they've got a local assembly
[1:37:39] a place that they can assemble together
[1:37:41] I I'd encourage them you've got a place
[1:37:44] to go and to
[1:37:46] [Music]
[1:37:47] feed and the second part that is just as
[1:37:52] important and goes along with it
[1:37:56] Fellowship many times we we get the
[1:37:58] feeding or sometimes the feeding and we
[1:38:00] think we got the feeding down but
[1:38:02] remember when you really feed on
[1:38:03] something it changes
[1:38:05] you it changes you when you feed on it
[1:38:07] that's how even when a sheep is they're
[1:38:09] eating it'll change them as they feed on
[1:38:12] those different grasses and different
[1:38:16] botney life
[1:38:18] throughout brother the Bram quotes that
[1:38:20] scripture not forsake ourselves
[1:38:22] assembling ourselves together that much
[1:38:24] more as we see the time coming sometimes
[1:38:27] we just simply have to tell our flesh
[1:38:29] like you heard the prophet tell tell his
[1:38:31] flesh when his flesh said just call
[1:38:33] Brother Neville tell brother Neville
[1:38:35] you're not even going to be there
[1:38:36] brother Bram said I told my flesh shut
[1:38:38] up you're not my boss I'm your
[1:38:42] boss come on friends even when we come
[1:38:45] here and sit in the house of God oh my
[1:38:48] oh you know sometimes it's a sacrifice
[1:38:50] to
[1:38:52] praise it's it's easy to worship and
[1:38:54] praise when everything is going just
[1:38:59] right if you're a Christian now watch
[1:39:02] just just friends take this and listen
[1:39:03] to this if you're a Christian you long
[1:39:07] to
[1:39:07] go where other Christians are and
[1:39:12] fellowship with other Christians not
[1:39:15] just go and see but
[1:39:18] Fellowship amen you see listen thank God
[1:39:21] for the feeding of the word but if you
[1:39:24] miss Fellowship you miss a part that God
[1:39:28] has called you to yeah to think beyond
[1:39:32] your own self that is so good oh I want
[1:39:35] to be like Jesus I want to be more like
[1:39:38] him and the prophet could say in images
[1:39:40] of Christ he said I want more of the
[1:39:42] Holy Ghost to take over more of William
[1:39:44] Bren amen he say a matter of fact he
[1:39:47] said I want another baptism of the Holy
[1:39:50] Ghost why brother brandom he said so I
[1:39:52] can be more
[1:39:54] of a
[1:39:55] servant like he was
[1:40:01] Sir so you cannot stay away from church
[1:40:05] and live the same
[1:40:07] life now there's there there's a lot to
[1:40:10] this here you can't do it because it's
[1:40:13] like I'm hungry I'll never go to a table
[1:40:17] I I I'll never eat I just ain't going to
[1:40:19] do it you've got to go and feed on the
[1:40:24] word of God and
[1:40:27] fellowship with one another notice how
[1:40:30] he puts the two together feed and
[1:40:36] fellowship let us
[1:40:39] consider one
[1:40:41] another but the same I do my wife my
[1:40:44] family no one another even going beyond
[1:40:48] our
[1:40:49] families going
[1:40:51] Beyond I know sometimes it's family
[1:40:53] sometimes this is the first time of the
[1:40:55] week with church time comes it's first
[1:40:56] time we get to see family I realize even
[1:40:58] with schedules and things going on I I
[1:41:00] realize that but listen friends it's
[1:41:02] just like this when we have meetings
[1:41:04] coming on we have new ones coming in Oh
[1:41:06] Brother Samuel I'll tell you so you know
[1:41:08] there's such a sweetness and such listen
[1:41:11] listen Even in our lives we want to be
[1:41:13] accommodating to others let me tell you
[1:41:17] when you if you go other places say oh
[1:41:19] they're so sweet how do you think they
[1:41:20] got that way you think the preacher back
[1:41:23] that in in his
[1:41:24] briefcase no that don't happen that way
[1:41:28] that comes from fervent dedication in
[1:41:32] hearts and lives to create an
[1:41:38] atmosphere there's been testimony after
[1:41:40] testimony different ones that's come
[1:41:43] right in here I pray to God I pray to
[1:41:45] God I I realize if they they realize if
[1:41:47] they could stay around long enough
[1:41:48] they'd realize we're not the Utopia
[1:41:50] we're just like any other Church we've
[1:41:52] got problems we've got ups and downs are
[1:41:55] you with me if they just said they stay
[1:41:57] around long enough but I don't say any
[1:41:58] of that because you know what we are
[1:42:00] every Church does we need one another
[1:42:03] but we're growing onto the
[1:42:05] Rapture we're not ignorant that oh my
[1:42:08] this is the
[1:42:12] Utopia but it requires
[1:42:14] us
[1:42:17] us how many of you like to walk into a
[1:42:20] reservice and you sense the atmosphere
[1:42:23] amen you just you just love
[1:42:25] that well let me just tell you something
[1:42:28] those atmosphere and those things you
[1:42:31] might be benefiting sometimes and I
[1:42:33] thank God so because sometimes there
[1:42:34] might be times when you're down and you
[1:42:36] walk in here thank God there's other
[1:42:38] saints of God when you or I have been
[1:42:40] discouraged that they have come together
[1:42:42] to create an atmosphere that we can move
[1:42:45] into and the pressures of Life can
[1:42:51] just man
[1:42:53] W it's nice to sit down here and thank
[1:42:56] you Lord Jesus and all of a sudden here
[1:42:58] we are sitting beside Reapers and about
[1:43:01] that time here Boaz reaches us some
[1:43:03] parch corn and and we're like Elijah
[1:43:05] we're just about tuckered out and and
[1:43:07] there's a good whole cake that comes our
[1:43:09] way made of some resurrection power and
[1:43:11] we get a hold of that
[1:43:13] we little something starts moving a
[1:43:16] little bit in us and and pretty soon you
[1:43:18] know there's something that starts
[1:43:19] moving there on the inside and and you
[1:43:21] know where at one time we just felt like
[1:43:23] that Gloom is something just starts
[1:43:25] moving there on the inside and the
[1:43:27] prophet said after a while he said I
[1:43:29] watch how a point is made and then I
[1:43:31] watch Tears stream down those eyes I
[1:43:34] watch a smile break across that face he
[1:43:36] said you know what that is that's the
[1:43:38] holy spirit in you feeding on the word
[1:43:42] of
[1:43:43] God
[1:43:44] hallelujah it's that part on you that
[1:43:47] you are giving the right away hallelujah
[1:43:50] it's saying I'm going to feed Hallelujah
[1:43:52] I'm going to feed I'm going to pull on
[1:43:54] the word of God we all have needs but as
[1:43:57] we're here right now and pulling on the
[1:43:59] gift of God listen friends it is a body
[1:44:02] Ministry we are here to fellowship with
[1:44:04] one another we're here to draw strength
[1:44:07] from elhi down into our lives that will
[1:44:10] literally change our lives one of these
[1:44:13] days will be the final moment of feeding
[1:44:16] and we will step from this Dimension
[1:44:19] into that
[1:44:21] Dimension and guess guess
[1:44:24] what when we get over there we'll still
[1:44:27] be feeding and
[1:44:29] fellowshipping you're Lov
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:33] him the prophet said he'll continue to
[1:44:36] unfold and reveal through the endless
[1:44:39] ages and we'll be fellowshipping hey
[1:44:41] brother I made it we'll be saying that
[1:44:43] at the Met wedding supper then maybe
[1:44:46] we'll get out there in the front yard of
[1:44:47] our Mansion maybe we'll be walking up
[1:44:49] and down the streets you go cuz there
[1:44:50] won't be nobody there to criticize us
[1:44:52] there
[1:44:53] we'll just begin to think of the
[1:44:55] goodness of God that he's brought us
[1:44:57] this far my Lord it was not my my it was
[1:45:00] not me and myself it was God's grace and
[1:45:03] God gave me Grace to recognize his grace
[1:45:06] thank you Lord for the strength to press
[1:45:09] through every battle thank you Lord when
[1:45:11] I needed a good oldfashioned barley cake
[1:45:13] Lord you reach me some barley cake Lord
[1:45:16] to strengthen me in my journey Hall
[1:45:23] amen hallelujah love
[1:45:25] him let's just stop there this
[1:45:29] morning what will we'll pick it
[1:45:34] up but I trust here this morning that
[1:45:36] even just as we take a little glimpse of
[1:45:38] this and would look at it quotes that I
[1:45:41] could refer to and read to I don't want
[1:45:43] you to look at these quotes or these
[1:45:46] things that we've ministered this
[1:45:47] morning on just going to church or about
[1:45:53] oh letting the enemy shame you listen
[1:45:56] when God comes with his word he don't
[1:45:57] shame you he'll correct you right this
[1:46:01] is why the prophet could say miss a
[1:46:02] day's work he said you all right there
[1:46:04] he said but don't miss church he said
[1:46:05] because your day's work is your daily
[1:46:07] bread and God promised he'd provide that
[1:46:08] if you put him
[1:46:10] first now there's always there there's
[1:46:12] always a part we understand you just
[1:46:13] don't call up your boss today and say
[1:46:15] hey no more
[1:46:17] buddy don't do that that's that that's
[1:46:19] not the wisdom behind that quote it a
[1:46:21] like glory to God man and I can quit my
[1:46:23] job that's not how it's application when
[1:46:25] what the prophet is talking about in
[1:46:27] these points and if God will give us
[1:46:30] Grace sometimes we as his children being
[1:46:33] the sheep that we are can get
[1:46:37] entangled and God helps us to see our
[1:46:41] entanglements and sometimes how that
[1:46:43] hinders us but I'm
[1:46:46] grateful that he comes down and he will
[1:46:49] find his sheep there's nothing as
[1:46:52] pitiful sometimes you hear a sheep maybe
[1:46:54] it's went off on its own and it gets
[1:46:57] into what they call these little mud
[1:46:58] bogs you don't realize what it is it's
[1:47:01] just standing around and all of a sudden
[1:47:03] it starts
[1:47:04] sinking I've watched I've seen videos
[1:47:07] where horses this has happened to horses
[1:47:09] it's happened to sheep but a sheep will
[1:47:11] just well that's called a distress call
[1:47:15] as well and when there's distress calls
[1:47:18] predators are always there somebody just
[1:47:22] gets a little offended they get a little
[1:47:25] offended or they get often oh there's a
[1:47:27] distress call that starts going out
[1:47:28] isn't it amazing I I've always been
[1:47:30] amazed at this how that offended and
[1:47:33] offenses seem to somehow join
[1:47:37] leagues I've always have been amazed at
[1:47:39] that as a Shepherd I've watched it I've
[1:47:42] watched things I've watched things to
[1:47:44] even when I've stood right here and the
[1:47:45] spirit of God would reveal things to me
[1:47:47] and I would meet with an individual
[1:47:49] later on and say you was fellowshipping
[1:47:51] with this person and this person was
[1:47:54] running down your confidence in the
[1:47:56] ministry I didn't make that happen that
[1:47:59] was for the benefit of that brother that
[1:48:02] was for the benefit of that brother to
[1:48:04] help him to see I've always been amazed
[1:48:06] at that but I've also always been amazed
[1:48:09] at hearts and
[1:48:11] lives just want to be so in tune with
[1:48:14] God it'll yoke together as well that's
[1:48:17] birds of a
[1:48:19] feather flock together yes Sirah
[1:48:22] I'll tell you what sheep want to be
[1:48:24] where sheep food's at that's right I
[1:48:27] want to be where sheep food's at I want
[1:48:28] to be with somebody it don't matter they
[1:48:30] don't have to be older than me I sat
[1:48:32] around with these these brothers here
[1:48:33] the other night we had Fellowship the
[1:48:35] young sisters had their had their little
[1:48:36] meeting and we had fellowship and we
[1:48:38] fellowshipped about the things of God I
[1:48:40] I wanted to hear what was on their
[1:48:41] hearts we wanted to fellowship and talk
[1:48:43] about these things I'll tell you what
[1:48:45] there's things that has that can be
[1:48:47] expressed all of a sudden it just things
[1:48:48] just start sparking on the inside and I
[1:48:50] love to see God working in Hearts I just
[1:48:53] oh those are the things to me I don't
[1:48:54] need caffeine then I don't need caffeine
[1:48:56] you just let me hear and see how God's
[1:48:58] working in people's lives and it's like
[1:49:00] it's like a joke for me right there oh
[1:49:02] my there's things that God oh my we
[1:49:05] don't you love
[1:49:06] him we're
[1:49:09] here let me just let me just stop it
[1:49:11] right here we're
[1:49:13] here to feed and to
[1:49:17] Fellowship now friends listen I'm going
[1:49:19] to tell you I'm not smart enough to know
[1:49:22] where to take you
[1:49:23] you I know who I've met and I know what
[1:49:27] he's called me to
[1:49:29] do do I feel in myself with that ability
[1:49:32] no no as a matter of fact if God carries
[1:49:35] it' be 22 years that I've been pastoring
[1:49:38] I feel less than I did when I first
[1:49:41] started the responsibility and the
[1:49:44] burden is so much
[1:49:46] greater and I'm not just telling you
[1:49:49] that but I say it from My Heart Lord I
[1:49:52] don't I don't have just Time moments I
[1:49:54] don't want to take people's time never
[1:49:57] have but I realize every
[1:50:00] moment God help me that your sheep as I
[1:50:04] stand and feed in your
[1:50:07] place help me Lord lead me to the to the
[1:50:11] slopes where the Dew has
[1:50:13] fallen lead us Lord to those places
[1:50:16] because you see what happens after the
[1:50:18] service is over your feeding doesn't
[1:50:21] stop right your Victory doesn't stop
[1:50:23] when brother you're not in the presence
[1:50:24] of brother Samuel you're in the presence
[1:50:27] of your Chief Shepherd he's the bishop
[1:50:29] and Shepherd of your soul and your
[1:50:31] feeding goes on and on and on and on
[1:50:34] through the week sometimes he might have
[1:50:35] us feeding in a certain area on a
[1:50:37] certain Hillside there on overcoming
[1:50:40] worry he might have us feeding on
[1:50:42] another Hillside studying Ruth he knows
[1:50:45] exactly what he's doing I just Lord you
[1:50:48] know the nutrients I need right now I
[1:50:51] want to eat I I want to feed on the word
[1:50:54] of God not just hear it I want to take
[1:50:56] it in and feed on it don't you love
[1:50:59] him amen let's just bow our heads in a
[1:51:01] word of
[1:51:06] prayer Heavenly
[1:51:10] Father Lord
[1:51:13] I Thank you Lord for your word thank you
[1:51:16] for the
[1:51:18] encouragement thank you Father for the
[1:51:23] admonition even where Ruth is at in her
[1:51:27] journey it never stops it never
[1:51:31] ceases as a matter of fact Lord God as
[1:51:33] it goes and it grows and it grows I
[1:51:36] just Lord reading of how your Prophet
[1:51:38] said it used to bother you to sit in
[1:51:40] church for 10
[1:51:42] minutes he said and listen to the
[1:51:45] preaching he said but after you got the
[1:51:47] Holy
[1:51:48] Ghost he said it don't bother you a bit
[1:51:51] you just feed he said because something
[1:51:53] in you that's
[1:51:55] feeding now Lord I know my flesh gets
[1:51:59] tired sometimes i' I've been there I've
[1:52:02] been there Lord where I've sat there and
[1:52:03] I realize for the people sitting in
[1:52:05] front of me those that I minister to
[1:52:07] here no matter where I've been
[1:52:10] Lord father there's only so much that
[1:52:13] our flesh even though we're lifted in
[1:52:16] Heavenly places but there's only so much
[1:52:18] Lord that our flesh can endure oh our
[1:52:21] heart oh M I feel like David I was glad
[1:52:24] when they said unto me let us go to the
[1:52:26] house of the
[1:52:27] Lord father may we lord as your children
[1:52:30] as we've taking a look here in the
[1:52:33] scriptures this with
[1:52:35] Ruth help us
[1:52:38] Lord as we look at these things on
[1:52:41] feeding and
[1:52:44] fellowship help us Lord I pray how that
[1:52:48] Lord that Satan would like to just get
[1:52:49] us off to ourselves and our own little
[1:52:52] ideas and our own little things he'd
[1:52:54] like to separate because that's when the
[1:52:56] wolf can get after us that's when things
[1:52:59] can get after us Lord I pray this
[1:53:01] morning if there's one that may be
[1:53:03] sitting here in their heart this morning
[1:53:05] that's
[1:53:06] strayed from the way of the
[1:53:09] Lord maybe Lord they look in their life
[1:53:12] and
[1:53:13] say I don't know if there's any way back
[1:53:15] for
[1:53:16] me
[1:53:19] Father you're the chief Shepherd
[1:53:22] Lord I could lay my hands on them I
[1:53:25] could speak to them but I can never
[1:53:27] touch them or speak to them in a way
[1:53:31] like you
[1:53:32] can now Lord I'm asking you Lord
[1:53:35] God that you would touch that Heart Lord
[1:53:39] maybe they've grown a little cold maybe
[1:53:42] indifferent Lord maybe they've got off
[1:53:45] Lord in to
[1:53:47] themselves maybe they've become
[1:53:49] entangled with the Affairs of life
[1:53:52] unbeknown Lord like Paul would write of
[1:53:54] a
[1:53:55] trap and the reason that that would be
[1:53:58] there is because Satan
[1:54:01] knows he
[1:54:03] knows and understands the
[1:54:07] value of the people of God coming and
[1:54:11] feeding and
[1:54:14] fellowshipping because Lord I'm not only
[1:54:17] thankful for the feeding I'm so glad for
[1:54:19] the fellowship of my brothers and
[1:54:22] sisters
[1:54:23] I love Lord to be able to stand out here
[1:54:25] and Shake one another's hand I love to
[1:54:28] be able to greet one
[1:54:30] another Lord I love Lord to be able to
[1:54:33] hear and to talk with your children Lord
[1:54:36] my brothers and
[1:54:38] sisters I love that Lord you know my
[1:54:40] heart I've told them many times but you
[1:54:42] know my heart I stand before you that's
[1:54:45] one of the things that I look forward to
[1:54:47] Lord in the week is being able to see
[1:54:50] them Lord is praying for him as I walk
[1:54:53] up and down when I'm here of a day I
[1:54:55] come right in here and I'll pray I'll
[1:54:58] walk through this Sanctuary I'll lay
