[31:59] shall drink of the well shall live
[32:01] eternal. Woo. That's a behold. What
[32:04] manner of man is this? What manner of

[33:17] Behold, what manner of man is this who
[33:20] stands between God and man? His eyes are
[33:24] as a flame of fire is in his hand. John
[33:29] saw him in the seven churches as a son
[33:32] in brilliancy.

[33:37] manner? Sing it, church. He's the Lord
[33:41] of glory. He is the great I am. He's the
[33:46] alpha and omega, the beginning and the
[33:50] end. His name it's wonderful. Prince of
[33:55] peace is he to him.
[33:59] All right, one more verse.
[34:02] Behold, what manner of man is this who
[34:05] sits on his heavenly throne. He rules
[34:09] and reigns from heaven above his beloved
[34:12] and his own. He's the lion of the tribe
[34:15] of Judah, the root of David. He behold
[34:20] what manner of man. This is what manner
[34:23] of. Well, he's the Lord.

[38:52] me go.
[38:54] [Applause]
[38:57] Hallelujah.
[38:58] Hallelujah.
[38:59] Amen. How many have that testimony?
[39:02] Amen. It was not us who found God. He
[39:04] wasn't lost. Amen.
[39:07] It was God who found us.
[39:10] We were the ones who were lost.
[39:12] Amen. We just um so thankful to be here
[39:15] this morning. I'm going to invite you to
[39:17] stand and we're going to go to the
[39:18] scriptures. I'm going to speak just a
[39:20] few moments before I have brother
[39:22] Michael and I introduce him to come on
[39:25] out. And um I want us to speak just a
[39:29] few few things here on our heart that
[39:32] would lead right into this of of the
[39:33] testimony. And um I just um I'm so
[39:37] thankful many um many times here over
[39:41] the past few years since I had met
[39:43] brother Michael um right in the stride
[39:45] of preaching um you know sometimes you
[39:48] know how it is you'll find me on certain
[39:50] paths and um things come to my mind and
[39:54] and much of brother Michael's testimony
[39:56] at different times and situations and
[39:58] things that I've been in the middle of
[39:59] ministering and I just pulled back and
[40:01] wouldn't share it uh because I thought,
[40:05] Lord, I don't want to take away from
[40:06] anything within this testimony at all
[40:08] because there's certain things that
[40:10] would so fit uh within there of of
[40:12] things we've been through and talked
[40:14] within the scriptures. But, you know,
[40:16] every one of us, you have a testimony.
[40:18] And if you don't have a testimony, God
[40:20] can God's the one to give you a
[40:22] testimony. That's right.
[40:23] And I want you to understand that the
[40:25] testimony itself in your life doesn't
[40:27] just begin when God um when finally
[40:31] there's a a full surrender. The
[40:33] testimony begins when you begin to
[40:35] surrender.
[40:36] God begins to turn your heart. God
[40:38] begins to take a hold of your life and
[40:40] your heart begins to yield to him. And
[40:43] so, um, uh, to me, how this has worked
[40:46] out, Brother Michael wasn't even
[40:47] supposed to be here, uh, in this time,
[40:50] had no idea. And all of a sudden, about
[40:52] a week before, I get a text, hey,
[40:54] Brother Samuel, I'm going to be I'm
[40:56] going to be working over here in Canton.
[40:58] That's where I'm stationed for right
[40:59] now. And I said, "Soon when you get
[41:01] here, I want you to give your
[41:03] testimony."
[41:04] And so I believe it'll be a great
[41:06] blessing to you. Amen. So let's turn
[41:09] into the scriptures. Ephesians chapter
[41:10] 2.
[41:13] And uh I want to read just a few verses
[41:16] of scripture. Thank you, musicians. And
[41:18] Amen. And
[41:30] In many ways, no doubt this is for Bible
[41:33] readers and working following in the
[41:36] message of the hour. You you come to
[41:38] realize the dearness of of the
[41:40] predestinated plan of Almighty God. And
[41:43] this is such a a tremendous passage of
[41:46] scripture as is all scripture. But to
[41:49] see this in in verse one, and you hath
[41:53] he quickened, who were dead in
[41:55] trespasses and sins, where in time past
[41:59] you walked according to the course of
[42:01] this world, according to the prince of
[42:03] the power of the air, the spirit that
[42:06] now workketh in the children of
[42:08] disobedience,
[42:10] among whom also we all had our
[42:13] conversation in times past in the lust
[42:16] of our flesh, fulfilling the desire ires
[42:18] of the flesh and of the mind and were by
[42:22] nature the children of wrath even as
[42:25] others. So we were right there.
[42:28] We were right there but right among them
[42:30] going just doing exactly what the rest
[42:33] of the world and wherever that we were
[42:35] running. But I love this in verse four.
[42:37] But God, who is rich in mercy,
[42:41] for his great love wherewith he loved
[42:43] us,
[42:44] even when we were dead in sins, hath
[42:46] quickened us together with Christ. By
[42:50] grace you are saved, and hath raised us
[42:52] up together, and made us sit together in
[42:55] heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in
[42:58] the ages to come, he might show the
[43:00] exceeding riches of his grace and his
[43:03] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[43:06] For by grace are you saved through
[43:08] faith, and that not of yourselves. It is
[43:11] the gift of God,
[43:12] not of works, lest any man should boast.
[43:16] For we are his workmanship, created in
[43:18] Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
[43:21] hath before ordained that we should walk
[43:24] in them.
[43:25] Amen. And the church said,
[43:27] "Amen."
[43:28] Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word
[43:29] of prayer. Heavenly Father, we certainly
[43:32] want to say thank you for this moment
[43:34] that we have Lord to come together.
[43:37] Lord, I certainly believe God it is a
[43:40] moment that Lord that just like in other
[43:43] times we come together. We believe it's
[43:45] not by accident or chance. We believe
[43:48] Lord that it is a pre-planned moment. So
[43:51] we ask that father that your anointing
[43:53] would just continue upon this service
[43:56] and just Lord speak I pray father
[43:59] through the testimony there of brother
[44:01] Michael Lord and may you Lord just so
[44:04] minister to our hearts Lord. You know
[44:06] every need Lord and you know just how to
[44:09] how to speak to us Lord. So we look to
[44:11] you Father in a very a very special way
[44:14] God. May your the blessings of God just
[44:17] move upon every heart in their life. May
[44:20] it be you, Father, that is set before us
[44:22] so clearly. We pray once again in Jesus
[44:25] precious name. Amen.
[44:27] Amen. God bless you. May be seated.
[44:30] Amen. Good to have Sister Roseanne home
[44:32] from her
[44:34] delegation across the country.
[44:38] It's good to have brother Brian and
[44:39] Sister Gracie and the kids here with us.
[44:41] And so just good to be gathered
[44:43] together. And you know, I think within
[44:45] every one of us, we we are to have, as I
[44:48] mentioned before, a personal testimony.
[44:50] And I just um you begin to recognize
[44:54] that there's things that like brother
[44:55] Brandon would say it in this way in the
[44:57] God who is rich in mercy. He says, "Many
[45:00] of you can fellowship with me on this
[45:02] thought. When you was a little boy or a
[45:04] little girl, you would walk around and
[45:06] there would be certain things that would
[45:08] just where it wouldn't bother other
[45:10] kids. It just seemed like there was
[45:12] something in you that cried out.
[45:15] There was God somewhere,
[45:17] yet you were a sinner.
[45:19] And he said, "How many remember that?"
[45:22] Now, that's what that was. That was that
[45:24] little form of life in you then.
[45:29] And after a while, you heard the gospel.
[45:31] Maybe you went to church. You picked out
[45:33] this and that and went from denomination
[45:35] to denomination. But one day you being a
[45:38] part of God, you had to be part of the
[45:40] word. And when you heard the word, you
[45:43] know where you come from.
[45:45] You know what was the truth.
[45:47] You were always the seed was in you
[45:50] always.
[45:52] The word seeing the word that was in you
[45:56] that was before the foundation of the
[45:58] world saw the word and you come to it.
[46:02] Praise the Lord.
[46:03] That's so good.
[46:04] Sometimes the where that the journey and
[46:07] where it starts the where the journey
[46:10] starts is not always it's not where it
[46:12] ends
[46:13] but there's always a beginning in our
[46:15] life just like when the prophet said you
[46:17] can go from it might have been just even
[46:19] in the the the simple message of of
[46:22] salvation which we thank God for
[46:24] salvation but to recognize that God's
[46:26] saving grace was is to take us from
[46:30] where we are and bring us fully into
[46:33] himself. self.
[46:34] That's that's the real goal of the
[46:36] gospel is that Christ himself would
[46:39] dwell within our lives.
[46:41] And you know, I want you to think of it
[46:43] in this way. How could we have ever
[46:47] found God?
[46:51] We couldn't.
[46:53] You It's like when you see this, it was
[46:57] God that actually was the one. He's the
[46:59] one that came looking for us. It was God
[47:02] who came down from glory
[47:05] in order to, you know, to make a way
[47:08] back for you and I. God had to become
[47:10] one of us.
[47:11] He had to God created the tabernacle for
[47:15] himself to come and dwell in that the
[47:17] blood might be shed that then that same
[47:20] life might come back into you and I. We
[47:22] couldn't we could not have the
[47:24] fellowship with God that God desired and
[47:27] what Adam and Eve had in the beginning.
[47:29] There had to be a mediator. There had to
[47:31] be one come. There had to be a blood
[47:33] that was shed and it could not be a
[47:35] polluted blood. And that blood would
[47:38] take care of every sin.
[47:41] Hallelujah.
[47:42] Hallelujah.
[47:43] That's why when you take the blood, the
[47:45] blood is the word. And you take the word
[47:48] to your life, when you begin to take the
[47:50] word to your life and you begin to draw
[47:53] your life through the word, the only
[47:55] thing that can come through there is
[47:57] holiness. This is why even within the
[48:00] little things of where Ruth grabbing
[48:02] handfuls of purpose, she's taking the
[48:04] word and she's applying it to your life.
[48:06] If you want if you want the Holy Spirit,
[48:08] if you want more of God in your life, it
[48:11] must apply the word to our lives
[48:14] and taking that word. And these are
[48:16] things that we as God begins to deal
[48:19] with our life because the spirit, the
[48:21] oil will always follow the word.
[48:24] Amen. It's always there to make that
[48:26] word alive and real. And this is where
[48:28] that something begins to stir in our
[48:31] hearts where you know you think about it
[48:33] that you you you go for a time in your
[48:36] life and you realize what what's what's
[48:38] different about me and you're something
[48:39] you just seem like you can't fit in and
[48:41] yet you seem to be fitting in very
[48:43] perfectly with the people that you were
[48:45] in the world with. I mean if you were a
[48:48] biker, you were a biker. You had a b
[48:49] motorbike like they did. You had a
[48:50] leather jacket like they did. You had
[48:52] all the things like they did. Yet what
[48:53] it was, it wasn't about all this that
[48:54] was out here. It looked like you fit
[48:56] there, but yet there was something in
[48:58] here that would not allow you to become
[49:00] settled.
[49:03] And and what was that? That was that
[49:05] part of God, that part of his word that
[49:08] lay within you and I.
[49:09] Hallelujah.
[49:10] That was that seed of promise. That was
[49:12] that little form of life that laid there
[49:14] that would not allow you to be
[49:17] comfortable where you were at. And
[49:20] that's what that's why God sends his
[49:22] word is to begin to touch that seed on
[49:26] the inside. And as the word comes,
[49:28] that's what begins to drive back the
[49:31] darkness. It begins to drive back the
[49:33] clouds. For what purpose? That we might
[49:36] see who he is. And by seeing who he is,
[49:40] then only through that can we begin to
[49:43] see who we really are. Amen.
[49:45] That's why it takes the revealing
[49:48] of of the son of man, the revealing of
[49:51] the Lord Jesus Christ. That's what the
[49:52] gospel is. The gospel is is not just the
[49:56] letter. The gospel is the word of God in
[49:59] action, the living God that reaches down
[50:01] and it touches our hearts and our lives
[50:04] of of where we're at and to let us know,
[50:06] you don't have to remain in the
[50:08] situation and where you're at. There has
[50:11] already been a provision that's been
[50:13] made for you, but you must accept it.
[50:17] And so to I I love how when brother
[50:19] Brandham brings this here because in the
[50:21] predestinated plan of God to see that
[50:24] everything through the scriptures, it is
[50:27] a drama. It has already been laid out.
[50:30] And God in in his infinite grace and
[50:33] mercy, it's God moving upon each and
[50:36] every bed of time, upon every seed, upon
[50:39] your life, upon my life in order to
[50:41] bring us into that place that we need to
[50:44] be that he might express himself through
[50:46] us.
[50:48] Now, you think of how that this origin
[50:50] that he calls us back to, Paul writes,
[50:53] Paul writes this in 2 Thessalonians 2
[50:56] 13- 14. He says, "We are bound to give
[50:58] thanks always to God for you, brethren,
[51:01] beloved of the Lord, because God hath
[51:04] from the beginning chosen you to
[51:07] salvation through sanctification of the
[51:10] spirit and belief of the truth,
[51:13] where to he called you by our gospel to
[51:16] the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
[51:19] Jesus Christ."
[51:20] Hallelujah.
[51:21] We thank God. We recognize it's a
[51:24] present revelation of Jesus Christ that
[51:27] he is the same yesterday, today, and
[51:30] forever that will actually begin to
[51:33] awaken that seed on the inside.
[51:37] Now, a person can go a long time before
[51:40] they finally recognize that they're a
[51:42] son of God.
[51:44] They can go a long time before they
[51:46] recognize that they're an eagle.
[51:48] But I want you to understand God is
[51:50] confident in his word because his word
[51:54] will be that which speaks to the word
[51:56] inside of you.
[51:57] Amen.
[51:58] Hallelujah.
[51:58] And you cannot you cannot get away from
[52:01] that. That word on the inside of you is
[52:04] really who you are.
[52:08] And it takes more than a church to
[52:10] release that in your life. Amen.
[52:13] It takes the presence of the living God
[52:16] to begin to awaken that seed,
[52:19] to begin to break back clouds, to begin
[52:22] to bring forth a certainty in a living
[52:25] God and to know that he is interested in
[52:29] my life.
[52:30] Amen.
[52:32] And brother Brandham, you know, as he'll
[52:33] say this, it's he'll refer to that
[52:35] little eagle story and talking about how
[52:37] that that little eagle was in the
[52:39] chicken yard and how that mama eagle
[52:41] went flying over. He was a eagle in the
[52:45] beginning.
[52:48] Hallelujah. He was always an eagle,
[52:50] always a son and daughter of God. Listen
[52:53] friends, underneath in Genesis 1, under
[52:55] the darkness that was covering the
[52:57] earth, the seeds were already there.
[52:59] What what needed to be is the is the
[53:01] light to shine through and break back
[53:03] the darkness. And when the light when
[53:06] the when the right nourishment got to
[53:08] the seed, the seed already had the power
[53:10] within itself to become
[53:13] what God had already spoken.
[53:16] And that's why that the word, the
[53:18] message of the hour is the presence of
[53:21] the living God that is sent to ripen the
[53:24] seed. It's sentin upon our lives to
[53:28] bring and begin to awaken us that
[53:29] there's something more than just being a
[53:32] good person.
[53:34] There's something more than just
[53:36] belonging to a church.
[53:38] There's something more than just being
[53:40] affiliated with a group of people. But
[53:42] it begins to move upon our heart that
[53:44] I'm not the son of whoever your parents
[53:47] are or the daughter of whoever your
[53:49] parents are, but I'm a son of God. I'm a
[53:52] daughter of God.
[53:53] Hallelujah. something begins to waken
[53:56] you and I
[53:57] and it takes the presence of God to
[53:59] begin to waken us that would lead us out
[54:03] of the darkness that we were in.
[54:05] Absolutely.
[54:06] The prophet says that's the way with
[54:08] every born again believer. You can hear
[54:10] all the theology you want, all the
[54:11] man-made discrepancy, but when that word
[54:14] flashes out there, then there is
[54:17] something takes a hold and you come to
[54:21] it.
[54:22] You were once dead in sin. The life that
[54:24] he's quickened, there has to be a life
[54:26] there to quicken first. God by his
[54:29] fornowledge knowed all things. And we
[54:32] were predestinated to be sons and
[54:34] daughters of God. You who were once dead
[54:37] in sin and trespasses wherein we all had
[54:39] our times past, but he hath quickened.
[54:42] Brother Ram said when Paul was on that
[54:44] road, he came face to face with that
[54:47] word Jesus.
[54:48] It quickened.
[54:50] Amen. Paul knew the law. He knew the
[54:52] writings. He knew what was speaking of
[54:55] the Messiah. But he needed to meet the
[54:58] God of the Bible.
[55:00] It's not enough to know the Bible.
[55:03] It's not enough to know the message.
[55:05] You've got to meet the God of this
[55:07] message
[55:10] because that's something that a church
[55:12] doesn't hold that revelation. Your
[55:14] parents don't hold that revelation. It's
[55:16] not a pastor who holds that revelation.
[55:18] God wants that revelation to be in your
[55:20] heart that I'm a son and daughter of
[55:22] God. And when that revelation strikes in
[55:26] our heart, it begins to light and it
[55:28] moves. And what is it? It's a life on
[55:30] the inside. No longer a life that I'm
[55:33] living or striving to live, but it is
[55:35] Christ
[55:36] that's living in me and living his life
[55:38] out.
[55:40] That is so good.
[55:41] Hallelujah. He came face to face with
[55:43] the word and it quickened. He come to
[55:45] life right quick because he was ordained
[55:49] to that.
[55:50] Amen.
[55:51] You know it's like brother says you hear
[55:53] about this little duck. He was born
[55:55] under a hen. Another story. He said
[55:57] funny looking little fella. He tried.
[55:58] Can you imagine how he tried to fit in?
[56:00] He's a duck trying to fit in with
[56:02] chickens. It's like the eagle trying to
[56:03] fit in with chickens. But all it took
[56:07] is all of a sudden one day he got a
[56:10] smell of water.
[56:12] Hallelujah. And when he got a smell of
[56:15] water, what was in him was born for the
[56:19] water.
[56:19] Hallelujah.
[56:22] All it took was to get a scent was to
[56:25] get the in the presence of almighty God.
[56:27] This word and it was something that you
[56:30] were born to be in.
[56:32] Hallelujah.
[56:32] You were ordained to be there.
[56:36] Oh, hallelujah. I think we all should
[56:39] rejoice on that.
[56:40] Yes, sir.
[56:41] That's a reality. That's something that
[56:43] stirs within within our hearts.
[56:45] Yes. Amen.
[56:47] Oh, God. It wasn't us. It was the water.
[56:49] It was the smell of the water. And he
[56:51] said he'd never been on a pond before.
[56:53] Never been in the water. But he was a
[56:55] duck to begin with.
[56:57] Don't worry about how to swim. You were
[56:59] born for it. Don't worry about how can I
[57:01] live it. You're born for it.
[57:03] It's within you. Just get in the
[57:05] presence of God.
[57:07] Just applying the word to your life.
[57:09] Don't let your mind be muddled up and
[57:11] confused, but just get in his presence.
[57:13] You were born for this.
[57:18] Praise the Lord.
[57:19] Hallelujah.
[57:20] Yes, sir.
[57:22] Only thing he had to do was come to
[57:23] himself.
[57:25] That's the same thing of a believer,
[57:27] right?
[57:28] There's something in him when he meets
[57:29] God face to face. He comes to himself.
[57:33] That seed is in him. It's quickened
[57:35] right away. He flies away from the
[57:36] things of the world. They become dead to
[57:38] him.
[57:39] Right?
[57:40] I remember we all had our life in those
[57:42] past, but once we got a hold of the real
[57:44] thing,
[57:46] something quickened us. A little seed
[57:48] that come to life and all the things of
[57:50] the world rotted right there.
[57:53] We had no more desire of it. He said,
[57:55] "The worshipper
[57:56] once purge has no more desire of sin.
[57:59] The sin question is over. You become a
[58:03] part of God in Christ and Christ died to
[58:06] redeem you.
[58:08] I just want to say that is just
[58:10] beginning ready to bring brother Michael
[58:12] here in just a few moments and we're
[58:15] going to ask sister Yokabeti to to sing
[58:17] before before brother Michael comes and
[58:21] I want you to see how that through there
[58:23] it was always about coming
[58:26] to yourself.
[58:28] That's what happened. It's God who
[58:30] brought us to ourselves.
[58:33] You sometimes you can be around a
[58:34] person. You've ever been around a
[58:35] person. They got in something that's
[58:37] happened maybe at a factory or a job or
[58:39] situations and my the horrible things
[58:41] that took place in Texas here with that
[58:43] flood of things that that that had taken
[58:45] place and then you people get into a
[58:48] place of a shock and you've got to
[58:50] somehow try to get them out of that
[58:52] shock
[58:53] and try to How do you do it? You don't
[58:54] shake it out of them,
[58:56] but you just you're right there with
[58:58] them. You're you're talking them through
[58:59] and they they'll come out of that shock
[59:01] that they're in. You and I sin had put
[59:04] us in a shock.
[59:06] And God by his presence,
[59:09] the presence of this word, the living
[59:11] God is what begin to awaken us.
[59:16] And it brings us what? Back to
[59:18] ourselves.
[59:19] It's not the image of a church.
[59:22] It's not the image of a of of a belief.
[59:25] It's the image of the living God. Amen.
[59:27] It's God bringing us back to ourselves.
[59:30] We were lost
[59:31] and he's bringing us back to ourselves.
[59:33] Staying in the presence of the word of
[59:35] God and God brings us completely to
[59:38] ourselves. Hearing the gospel, believing
[59:41] the gospel, applying the gospel, then
[59:44] the Holy Spirit will come.
[59:46] God bringing us to ourselves.
[59:48] Do you love him?
[59:49] Amen.
[59:50] Amen. It's like that prodical son.
[59:53] God begins to lead us in the direction
[59:55] we need to go. No doubt many of us,
[59:56] you've been in a place where you look
[59:58] around, somebody's calling your name.
[59:59] How many of you been in a place where
[1:00:01] somebody's calling your name and you're
[1:00:02] trying to figure out where where are
[1:00:03] they at?
[1:00:05] Right? You you sometimes there might be
[1:00:07] things blocking at a building or
[1:00:08] something and you're trying to figure
[1:00:09] out are they on this side of the
[1:00:10] building or this side of the house or
[1:00:12] where are they at? And you're trying to
[1:00:13] find because you're hearing your name,
[1:00:15] but you need to get get into a place to
[1:00:17] where you can finally find the direction
[1:00:20] where they are.
[1:00:21] And see, it's God. This word is calling
[1:00:24] your name.
[1:00:25] Amen.
[1:00:26] And what it is is God getting you into a
[1:00:29] place of the direction
[1:00:31] for the word to come to pass.
[1:00:34] Oh, there might be obstacles. There
[1:00:35] might be a lot of things that could be
[1:00:36] in the life. But if you'll just keep
[1:00:38] looking to his voice and say, "Lord,
[1:00:41] lead me and guide me." He will lead and
[1:00:44] guide you.
[1:00:45] Yes, he will
[1:00:45] into the fulfillment of his word.
[1:00:48] He'll take care of everything. How many
[1:00:49] witnesses of that? Amen.
[1:00:51] God will take care of everything.
[1:00:53] Amen. So, Brother Brian, maybe come and
[1:00:55] help Sister Yokabed as she just just a
[1:00:58] moment. I'll let me just let me do
[1:01:00] something here real quick. I want to

[1:01:23] there on the border. They was there a
[1:01:25] few years ago in Brownsville and also

[1:01:33] Mexican border in Maramoros, and that's
[1:01:34] where Sister Yokabeted is is from. And
[1:01:37] so, there'll be a lot that has to deal

[1:01:55] be there uh with brother Benito, uh the
[1:01:59] the pastor there now, and then brother,
[1:02:01] uh Michael. And brother Michael, our
[1:02:03] paths crossed when I was preaching a
[1:02:05] meeting for brother Mike Walls in
[1:02:06] Washington DC. And he asked me, he said,
[1:02:08] "Do you do you go overseas?" that
[1:02:13] I don't like I don't like long flights.
[1:02:16] Almost flying to Phoenix is a little bit
[1:02:18] too long for me. He said, "You do do I"
[1:02:21] I said, "I don't know." He said, he
[1:02:23] said, "Well, we're just right across the
[1:02:24] border." Okay. I'm thinking of
[1:02:26] Philippines or Australia. Oh, man. But,
[1:02:29] uh, this is the the church where where
[1:02:32] they're at. Uh, and the the tabernacle,

[1:07:43] Amen.
[1:07:44] Amen.
[1:07:45] That sounds like a Texas hymn.
[1:07:49] That's what brother Prairie Green uh
[1:07:51] said one time and I was in my testimony.
[1:07:55] I'll talk about that, but my wife sang
[1:07:57] that same song
[1:07:59] long time ago and he's from Bar of the
[1:08:02] Green was from Bulmont, so he he liked
[1:08:05] the the instruments.
[1:08:10] Well, thank you, brother Samuel, for the
[1:08:11] introduction. U
[1:08:14] a beautiful song, right?
[1:08:18] It's not our power, it's his power.
[1:08:20] Right.
[1:08:22] It's not our grace, it's his grace.
[1:08:24] Amen.
[1:08:27] It's not our glory. It's his glory.
[1:08:31] He found us.
[1:08:33] We didn't find him.
[1:08:34] Amen.
[1:08:36] It's all about him.
[1:08:39] And it's all about you.
[1:08:42] If there's anything in me, it's only by
[1:08:45] his grace.
[1:08:48] I have it's not by works because I lived
[1:08:52] a life contrary to this Bible.
[1:08:55] So it's all about him.
[1:08:59] So it's a beautiful thing. A deep call
[1:09:02] us a deep.
[1:09:04] Amen.
[1:09:05] That's good.
[1:09:08] You know the best thing that God gave us
[1:09:11] bes men besides salvation
[1:09:16] is a good wife.
[1:09:18] My wife has been a good wife to me
[1:09:21] and I thank God.
[1:09:23] Can't live without her.
[1:09:26] It's
[1:09:28] God is God is good. He gives us the
[1:09:31] desires of our heart. And how much if he
[1:09:33] doesn't give us he gives us the desires
[1:09:35] of our heart. How much How much will he
[1:09:38] not give us the promises of this Bible?
[1:09:42] Right?
[1:09:44] So,
[1:09:45] it's all about you. It's not about me.
[1:09:50] I'm just a a prisoner of Christ.
[1:09:54] I shouldn't be alive, but there's a
[1:09:57] purpose and a season for everything.
[1:10:00] And
[1:10:03] I couldn't withhold my my my tears when
[1:10:06] brother Samuel was speaking about
[1:10:09] predestination.
[1:10:13] It's just something about when you when
[1:10:16] man meets God
[1:10:21] is from that time
[1:10:24] something happened. All right.
[1:10:26] So,
[1:10:28] make yourself at home.
[1:10:32] We're seated in heavenly places. Right.
[1:10:35] So,
[1:10:38] I won't say much about your pastor,
[1:10:42] but I will do this. And God guided me to
[1:10:45] do this. I did this with my pastor.
[1:10:48] Thank you. That sounded better. Can you
[1:10:51] raise it up a little bit?
[1:10:54] I did this with my pastor. Oh, it's me.
[1:10:56] Sorry.
[1:10:58] So, I'll speak like this. So, I did this
[1:11:02] with my pastor.
[1:11:04] I had a in ' 96 I was guided to this
[1:11:07] church that you all saw and I was guided
[1:11:10] to uh our our previous pastor who passed
[1:11:14] away about five years ago.
[1:11:17] And um
[1:11:19] God gave me the opportunity to be close
[1:11:23] to him and his testimony
[1:11:27] had a great impact in my life.
[1:11:32] Truly a great man of God. With any doubt
[1:11:35] I I am part of who I am because of him
[1:11:39] and how he teaches us the true word of
[1:11:41] God. I have learned so much from him and
[1:11:44] my desire is for God to bless him with
[1:11:46] many years of life and health together
[1:11:49] with him in our church. God gave me the
[1:11:52] opportunity on his birthday to celebrate
[1:11:55] it. And I didn't I'm not much of a
[1:11:57] singer. I can only sing with a crowd or
[1:11:58] in the shower, right?
[1:12:01] But God gave me this words to give it to
[1:12:03] him in life. In life. do everything in
[1:12:07] life
[1:12:09] because yesterday's gone and tomorrow
[1:12:12] may not be ours,
[1:12:13] right?
[1:12:14] So if you have your mother or your
[1:12:17] father alive that a boy goes a long way,
[1:12:22] hug. Hey mom, I love you. Hey dad, I
[1:12:25] love you. Hey son, I
[1:12:29] I love you.
[1:12:32] Hey daughter, I love you. Grandma,
[1:12:35] grandpa,
[1:12:37] make it happen. Live today as if it's
[1:12:39] your last day,
[1:12:41] right? Enjoy it, right? So,
[1:12:50] this is I I want to I know how it is.
[1:12:54] This is my pastor
[1:12:56] and I just want to show you a little bit
[1:12:59] who he was. Now,
[1:13:02] do you
[1:13:04] see that there? Yeah, that's him. That's
[1:13:07] in Africa. We were in Congo.
[1:13:10] That's me. Um,
[1:13:13] Yep. fishing. God gave me the
[1:13:15] opportunity. I would tell him, "Hey,
[1:13:17] would you happen to be go out and, you
[1:13:19] know, I got a
[1:13:21] fishing rental. I want to go and get
[1:13:23] some rest." And he would, he would just,
[1:13:25] you know what? I'll take you up on that.
[1:13:27] Let's go. I need to get some rest.
[1:13:30] So
[1:13:33] that's me and him. Him. Just a little of
[1:13:36] of how many 20 years God
[1:13:40] gave me this pastor.
[1:13:42] Wow.
[1:13:43] And I truly miss him.
[1:13:48] And and uh
[1:13:52] now God has given us a a new pastor,
[1:13:54] brother Ben Bonito, which you all saw,
[1:13:56] which we which God has also blessed us.
[1:14:01] He was part of our first pastor's
[1:14:04] uh ministry. And brother Benito has been
[1:14:08] a good pastor and God has also gave me
[1:14:11] some time to spend with him.
[1:14:14] He's been with our pastor for for five
[1:14:16] years now.
[1:14:19] But I wanted to say these words
[1:14:22] and I believe you and I wanted to share
[1:14:25] the same words I shared with my pastor
[1:14:27] and I believe even though I'm not from
[1:14:30] this church but uh I really it's an
[1:14:33] honor and pleasure to have met your
[1:14:35] pastor.
[1:14:36] It's it's something personal in me
[1:14:38] because
[1:14:40] God is always on time.
[1:14:44] And when brother Samuel came and the
[1:14:47] Lord gave him the green light to come,
[1:14:49] it was such a blessing for our church
[1:14:51] and for our pastor.
[1:14:55] And I just can't explain it. But I
[1:14:59] wanted to say um these words and I
[1:15:03] believe everyone in this congregation
[1:15:08] wants to say thank you, brother Samuel.
[1:15:11] It says like this. I Pastor Samuel,
[1:15:15] everyone in the congregation thanks God
[1:15:17] because
[1:15:19] he rewarded us with you with your life,
[1:15:22] with your love.
[1:15:24] Many of us walk like sheep without a
[1:15:27] shepherd and the Holy Spirit guided us
[1:15:30] in this congregation.
[1:15:32] We want to tell you that your trials and
[1:15:34] your ef your efforts have borne fruit
[1:15:37] through your afflictions. You have
[1:15:39] taught us, you have taught us by your
[1:15:41] example to love God, to keep in mind
[1:15:44] that God should always be first in our
[1:15:47] hearts. Lord, as we as we ask that you
[1:15:51] keep our pastor
[1:15:54] and that we may be grateful for all his
[1:15:56] works,
[1:16:00] Lord, bless every minute of his life and
[1:16:04] that like Abraham, you may give him long
[1:16:06] days.
[1:16:08] This is our prayer for you, Pastor
[1:16:10] Samuel. Right, congregation?
[1:16:15] This is our prayer for you, Pastor
[1:16:16] Samuel. Do not tire, do not faint,
[1:16:20] for your labor has not been in vain.
[1:16:23] Pastor, thank you for your dedication.
[1:16:26] We know that everything will be fine.
[1:16:30] You are the pastor who, like David,
[1:16:33] cared for his sheep and saved them from
[1:16:35] the bear and the lion. This is how you
[1:16:38] fight for us in person and in prayer.
[1:16:41] How can we not thank God for your life,
[1:16:44] for your dedication? Everyone in the
[1:16:46] congregation wants to tell you that we
[1:16:49] love you very much, Pastor Samuel.
[1:16:52] That's right.
[1:16:53] Right.
[1:16:54] So, I just wanted to do that.
[1:16:57] And that just tells me so you could see
[1:17:00] how much I love your pastor.
[1:17:02] Amen. and how
[1:17:05] you know how what a beautiful blessing
[1:17:07] that you all have to have
[1:17:10] a caliber of a pastor like Samuel to
[1:17:13] guide you.
[1:17:14] So it's a blessing.
[1:17:17] So moving forward
[1:17:20] um
[1:17:23] are you here?
[1:17:26] Are you here?
[1:17:28] Amen.
[1:17:30] That's what I tell my my my my uh at
[1:17:34] work. I I'm a safety and I like I do my
[1:17:36] safety meetings, but I like to make it
[1:17:38] personal
[1:17:39] because you got to make it personal.
[1:17:42] And sometimes we're away from our
[1:17:43] family, our homes, our children, and
[1:17:46] they it's a rough industry, but I always
[1:17:48] say, "Are you here?" I can see them, but
[1:17:52] they might be going through certain
[1:17:53] personal issues. I want to stay focused.
[1:17:57] So, I'm glad you are here. Forget about
[1:17:59] everything.
[1:18:00] Forget about what time we're going to
[1:18:02] eat.
[1:18:03] I'm going to tell you the I love to eat.
[1:18:08] But I'll tell you what, the best
[1:18:09] seasoning is hunger.
[1:18:12] So,
[1:18:14] forget about all that. It's God's time.
[1:18:17] How much time did not when we were in
[1:18:20] the world did not we stayed so many
[1:18:23] hours doing this and that and we didn't
[1:18:25] fall asleep,
[1:18:27] right? How much time do we spend on our
[1:18:29] phones? How much time do we do this and
[1:18:31] that? And there's no obstacle. But when
[1:18:35] you want to do something right, there's
[1:18:36] always an obstacle.
[1:18:40] So, I hope everybody had a good Fourth
[1:18:41] of July with their families, families,
[1:18:44] and everybody. It's a time of getting
[1:18:45] out of work and spending time with your
[1:18:48] family, your kids, your loved ones. And
[1:18:51] like I said, just make it count.
[1:18:54] Make it count.
[1:18:58] So, it's like I said, it's a good
[1:19:00] pleasure and honor to be here
[1:19:03] to give my testimony.
[1:19:04] Amen.
[1:19:05] But it is God's grace, right?
[1:19:08] This is not my testimony. This is a
[1:19:10] testimony of God's amazing grace.
[1:19:15] God's amazing grace.
[1:19:17] Amen.
[1:19:18] I just want to share before I start my
[1:19:20] testimony here real quick. And I hope
[1:19:22] you don't you can understand my
[1:19:23] spanglish, right? I have no education.
[1:19:28] I didn't graduate from high school.
[1:19:31] So, please bear with me. I am, you know,
[1:19:35] so, but God will make a way.
[1:19:37] Amen.
[1:19:38] God is perfect in everything he does.
[1:19:40] I looked up the word testimony and I
[1:19:42] wrote a couple things yesterday that God
[1:19:44] put in my heart to for God um to give
[1:19:48] you.
[1:19:49] Testimony is sometimes our testimony is
[1:19:52] to be shared or to encourage
[1:19:55] others
[1:19:56] to demonstrate the power of God or an
[1:20:00] evidence or proof provided by an
[1:20:02] eyewitness. Right? An eyewitness.
[1:20:06] Somebody that was at the scene,
[1:20:10] a personal experience with God.
[1:20:13] Amen.
[1:20:14] That's what it's about. All right.
[1:20:17] Not with religion, not with tradition.
[1:20:21] It's having an individual experience
[1:20:23] with Jesus Christ.
[1:20:29] And when that happens
[1:20:31] and at that time, right? Remember that
[1:20:34] quote at that time.
[1:20:39] Not with religion, not with the with
[1:20:41] tradition.
[1:20:43] Going to church is not enough.
[1:20:46] Speaking in tongues is not enough.
[1:20:50] All those things are good and we believe
[1:20:53] in it.
[1:20:57] All that is good. But we must have an
[1:21:01] individual experience with Jesus Christ.
[1:21:07] And once you have that individual
[1:21:09] experience,
[1:21:11] nothing can take that away.
[1:21:15] That's right.
[1:21:16] Nothing can take that away. From that
[1:21:19] time, something happened.
[1:21:23] Amen.
[1:21:23] When you have that experience with Jesus
[1:21:27] Christ,
[1:21:29] something happened.
[1:21:30] That's right.
[1:21:31] I may not be where I want to be. I may
[1:21:34] not be that which I want to be. But one
[1:21:36] thing I do know, I'm no longer that
[1:21:39] which I used to be.
[1:21:42] From that time something happened.
[1:21:46] Hallelujah.
[1:21:49] From death unto life.
[1:21:54] From no hope to hope.
[1:21:58] From no peace to having peace.
[1:22:03] From no joy to having joy.
[1:22:07] Oh my brother.
[1:22:10] My sister. There is no hole.
[1:22:13] There is no hole deep enough
[1:22:17] that God's everlasting hand
[1:22:20] and mercy and grace can bring you out
[1:22:22] of.
[1:22:25] There is no circumstances
[1:22:27] or situations
[1:22:31] too big for Almighty God
[1:22:34] to fix it.
[1:22:37] We are born again. And from that time
[1:22:43] back then he walked with his disciples.
[1:22:48] Right.
[1:22:51] But today,
[1:22:53] July 6, 2025,
[1:22:56] at Believer's Spoken Word Tabern
[1:22:59] Tabernacle in Sheffield, Ohio, God
[1:23:03] before the foundation of the world, knew
[1:23:06] that there would be a bride fulfilling
[1:23:08] Galatians 2:20, that it is no longer us
[1:23:12] who live, but Christ who lives in us,
[1:23:15] and that the life that we now live in
[1:23:17] this flesh, we live it by the faith of
[1:23:20] the son of God who loved us and gave
[1:23:24] himself for us.
[1:23:26] How beautiful that could be. That is
[1:23:29] he loved us and it is no longer us who
[1:23:33] lives
[1:23:35] because at that time we died to this
[1:23:39] flesh.
[1:23:41] Hallelujah.
[1:23:45] We now live it by the faith of the son
[1:23:47] of God who loved us and gave himself for
[1:23:49] us.
[1:23:53] We were always
[1:23:55] a son and daughter of God.
[1:23:58] Predestinated before the foundation of
[1:24:00] the world,
[1:24:01] right?
[1:24:02] He was always with us.
[1:24:05] He was always with me. When I was out
[1:24:08] there
[1:24:10] close to death many times,
[1:24:13] but I was blind. I couldn't see. But God
[1:24:17] is always on time.
[1:24:21] Think about it.
[1:24:23] He was always on time.
[1:24:28] The devil wanted to kill us. But greater
[1:24:32] is he that is in us
[1:24:36] than he that is in the world.
[1:24:40] He is still the same yesterday, today,
[1:24:43] and forever.
[1:24:44] The same God who opened the Red Sea for
[1:24:47] Moses.
[1:24:48] Amen.
[1:24:49] Is the same God we are believing today
[1:24:53] this morning.
[1:24:55] Who forgive us all our iniquities, all
[1:24:58] our sins.
[1:25:00] Right.
[1:25:01] and heal us all our diseases.
[1:25:04] Hallelujah.
[1:25:07] Oh my brother and sister, at any moment,
[1:25:13] he can get up from his throne of grace.
[1:25:21] At any moment, he will stand up and
[1:25:24] there will be no more mercy.
[1:25:27] There will be no more grace.
[1:25:28] That's right. And brother Brandham says
[1:25:30] this in a message. I can't remember
[1:25:32] where, but he's almost crying and it's
[1:25:35] towards the end of the service. And he
[1:25:38] says, "At any moment, he will rise from
[1:25:41] his throne of grace and there will be no
[1:25:43] mercy. There will be no more grace. It
[1:25:46] will be like in the times of Noah,
[1:25:50] and that door
[1:25:53] was closed,
[1:25:54] but Noah was sealed inside the ark.
[1:25:59] And he preached to them for 120 years.
[1:26:03] But they didn't believe,
[1:26:06] right?
[1:26:07] And they would throw
[1:26:09] tomatoes and oh, they would say, "You're
[1:26:11] crazy. No, it's not going to rain,
[1:26:13] right?"
[1:26:14] But it came a time,
[1:26:16] right?
[1:26:17] When the started to get dark and that
[1:26:20] rain came in, but it was too late.
[1:26:24] And they were probably crying outside,
[1:26:27] Noah, open up the door.
[1:26:29] And Noah would have opened it, but he
[1:26:31] didn't close it.
[1:26:35] Amen.
[1:26:37] Many people are going to want to do it
[1:26:39] over again. They will realize that it
[1:26:41] was this was the truth,
[1:26:43] but it's going to be too late.
[1:26:45] That's why I say we got to live
[1:26:49] like if it's our last time. All right.
[1:26:52] It's Christ and live that lives in us.
[1:26:55] And we must die to the things of the
[1:26:58] world. And we must put God in first
[1:27:00] place, second place, third place.
[1:27:03] Amen.
[1:27:10] At any moment, everyone has a testimony.
[1:27:15] Now remember, it's the little things
[1:27:19] that make him big.
[1:27:20] Amen. It's a little things that we do,
[1:27:23] inviting somebody to church, speak a
[1:27:24] little word for Jesus, testify, sing,
[1:27:27] pray,
[1:27:29] and it's like bread upon the waters.
[1:27:32] It'll return to you someday.
[1:27:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:36] This is this is all about you. Sometimes
[1:27:39] we might feel like that we are not so
[1:27:42] some big person that we are not
[1:27:43] sufficient.
[1:27:45] But it is written in the scriptures that
[1:27:47] it's not the big things that we do.
[1:27:51] It's the little things that we leave
[1:27:52] undone.
[1:27:55] But Jesus knew every little thing that
[1:27:57] you do.
[1:27:59] You can't do anything too little
[1:28:02] that Jesus sees it.
[1:28:04] Right.
[1:28:05] No matter where it is, what it is, and
[1:28:07] any little testimony or display of
[1:28:10] loyalty to Jesus that you do, he knows
[1:28:13] the sparrow that fall in the street. He
[1:28:15] knows the very thoughts of the heart. So
[1:28:17] we are so glad to know that every little
[1:28:20] thing that we do, Jesus sees it, sees us
[1:28:23] do it.
[1:28:25] He knows the objectives and he knows
[1:28:27] your motives that we have it that we
[1:28:30] have in it. Didn't he say one time,
[1:28:33] verily, verily, I say unto you, if you
[1:28:35] give as much of a cup of cold water to
[1:28:38] one of these,
[1:28:39] shall it no wise, you shall no wise lose
[1:28:42] your reward. Jesus said Jesus said I was
[1:28:45] sick and you didn't visit me. I was in
[1:28:47] prison, you didn't visit me. I was
[1:28:50] hungry, you didn't feed me, etc.
[1:28:53] as you have done it unto one of these
[1:28:55] little ones.
[1:28:57] And we know what the scripture says.
[1:29:01] So I wanted to share that before I give
[1:29:03] my testimony.
[1:29:04] from death unto life.
[1:29:09] He has redeemed our life
[1:29:12] from the pit.
[1:29:15] Right? We've all been in that pit.
[1:29:18] We've all been in that time in our lives
[1:29:20] when we think there's no hope.
[1:29:25] We all had that pit experience.
[1:29:29] And I would like to start my testimony
[1:29:31] just read just uh on on uh Psalms 103
[1:29:36] from from 1 through
[1:29:39] to uh
[1:29:42] from 1 through to 12.
[1:29:46] And it says like this.
[1:29:49] Praise the Lord, oh my soul. All my
[1:29:52] inmost being praise his holy name.
[1:29:57] Praise the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[1:29:59] not all his benefits.
[1:30:02] Who forgives us all your who forgives
[1:30:06] all your sins and heal heals all your
[1:30:09] diseases.
[1:30:11] Who redeems your life from the pit
[1:30:15] and crowns you with love and compassion.
[1:30:18] Who satisfies your desires with good
[1:30:21] things so that your youth is renewed
[1:30:23] like the eagles.
[1:30:25] Amen. The Lord works righteousness and
[1:30:27] justice for all the oppressed. He made
[1:30:30] known his ways to Moses, his deeds to
[1:30:32] the people of Israel. The Lord is
[1:30:34] compassionate and gracious, slow to
[1:30:37] anger, abounding in love. He will not
[1:30:41] always accuse, nor will he harbor his
[1:30:43] anger forever. He does not treat us as
[1:30:47] our sins deserve. Amen.
[1:30:50] Or repay us according to our iniquities.
[1:30:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:55] For as high as the heavens are above the
[1:30:58] earth, so great is his love for those
[1:31:00] who fear him. As far as the east is from
[1:31:03] the west, so far has he removed our
[1:31:06] transgressions from us.
[1:31:08] Amen.
[1:31:09] Amen.
[1:31:10] Amen.
[1:31:12] Let me just say a short prayer and I
[1:31:15] will give my testimony.
[1:31:18] Dear heavenly father,
[1:31:20] as we come humbly to your throne of
[1:31:22] grace, father, it's all about you,
[1:31:24] father.
[1:31:25] It's all about you, Lord. It's your
[1:31:27] grace. It's your mercy.
[1:31:30] We are here because now we have a spirit
[1:31:34] of appreciation and gratitude and we
[1:31:37] want to live for you
[1:31:40] because he who is forgiven much love
[1:31:42] much. Father, Lord, I put every of my
[1:31:46] brother and sisters in your hands. You
[1:31:48] know every need. You know every
[1:31:50] obstacles that they're going through.
[1:31:52] You know all things, Father.
[1:31:55] May you come, Lord.
[1:31:59] Like you always do, Father.
[1:32:01] And if we hear your voice, the
[1:32:03] scriptures say, "Do let us not hearken
[1:32:05] our hearts."
[1:32:08] And may we say this morning,
[1:32:13] may we at this time, from this time,
[1:32:17] from this time
[1:32:20] we want to renew ourselves, Father.
[1:32:24] From this time, Father, I put everything
[1:32:27] in your hands
[1:32:29] and I ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:32:33] Amen. So, I'm happy to be here.
[1:32:36] Um,
[1:32:38] like I said, uh, like brother Samuel
[1:32:43] said, um, I'm from Texas. I live on the
[1:32:45] border of Texas and Mexico.
[1:32:49] I was born in 1972. I'm 53 years old.
[1:32:53] from the age 211 to 24. In that span of
[1:32:57] time,
[1:32:59] I
[1:33:01] started
[1:33:04] to hang around with a one of my cousins
[1:33:07] that came to live with my grandma and he
[1:33:09] influenced me in marijuana.
[1:33:13] And from that time,
[1:33:16] my life started going downhill.
[1:33:20] The devil was very cunning.
[1:33:22] Yes.
[1:33:23] He puts everything in a silver platter.
[1:33:25] Here it is.
[1:33:28] Drugs, rock and roll, women, but at the
[1:33:33] end, he wants to kill, steal, and
[1:33:34] destroy.
[1:33:36] I didn't know this. I didn't know the
[1:33:38] Bible. I had never opened the Bible in
[1:33:39] my life. We were Catholics and we didn't
[1:33:42] even go to church, uh, Catholic church.
[1:33:45] It was only a religion, a tradition.
[1:33:48] But I didn't know how the devil worked.
[1:33:51] I didn't know. And I hope you could see
[1:33:52] and I know you do.
[1:33:55] But that was his objective to that's his
[1:33:57] objective every day is to kill and
[1:34:00] destroy us.
[1:34:00] Oh yeah.
[1:34:02] But he can't touch the elect.
[1:34:07] This was me.
[1:34:10] I started as a young little boy. I love
[1:34:12] baseball.
[1:34:14] I love boxing. My dad put me in boxing
[1:34:16] and baseball. I was playing varsity
[1:34:19] baseball when I was a freshman in high
[1:34:22] school.
[1:34:23] Okay, this was me on the little arrow
[1:34:27] right there. I was play short uh pitcher
[1:34:30] and and third base and shorts stop. But
[1:34:33] then I started to hang around with my
[1:34:36] cousin who came at the age of 11.
[1:34:41] And this, as you can see right there,
[1:34:45] you see the difference.
[1:34:47] Have this Iron Mane shirt. And you can
[1:34:49] see in my eyes that from that time
[1:34:55] from that time
[1:35:02] and
[1:35:05] I went through a lot from the age of 11
[1:35:07] to 24. I was in rehabs. I was in AA
[1:35:10] meetings, NA meetings.
[1:35:13] I overdosed twice with cocaine.
[1:35:16] I was in heroin.
[1:35:20] It came it was I could feel the hurt I
[1:35:24] was causing those that love me, which
[1:35:27] number one was my mom.
[1:35:30] I'm real close to my mom. I have an
[1:35:32] older brother,
[1:35:34] then it's me, and then I have a a
[1:35:36] younger sister, Liza. my older brother
[1:35:38] Albert, me, and then my sister Liza, and
[1:35:40] then my uh little brother Mario.
[1:35:44] But I was always real close to my mom.
[1:35:48] And as I lived through that age of 11 to
[1:35:51] 24,
[1:35:53] my dad came back from Vietnam and he had
[1:35:56] a a drug habit in in Vietnam, which was
[1:36:00] marijuana and alcohol. But my dad was
[1:36:03] always a good dad. He took me fishing.
[1:36:05] He always provided for the family,
[1:36:09] but I grew around that environment where
[1:36:11] there's drugs and and and and and it was
[1:36:14] normal. And I always grew up with older
[1:36:16] people. I didn't get to to uh live with
[1:36:21] my own peers.
[1:36:25] So, as I was
[1:36:28] as I'm living this life,
[1:36:32] I wanted to get away. I wanted to get
[1:36:34] away from those people. I wanted to live
[1:36:37] go I wish I could I remember thinking I
[1:36:40] wish I could go back to when I to to
[1:36:43] when to when I uh when I was this this
[1:36:45] small and I wish I could do things over
[1:36:48] again.
[1:36:49] But it was it I didn't know how it was
[1:36:53] too late. I had a I was smoking about 20
[1:36:57] cigarettes of marijuana a day. I was
[1:37:00] drinking so much alcohol.
[1:37:03] And then at one point I I'm about to
[1:37:05] graduate from high school
[1:37:08] and
[1:37:10] or a little bit after that. I I didn't
[1:37:12] graduate. I needed half a credit of
[1:37:13] economics to graduate, but I wanted to
[1:37:16] leave
[1:37:18] because I didn't want to see my mom get
[1:37:20] hurt. I didn't want to see her cry. I
[1:37:22] wanted to make her proud. And my
[1:37:24] friends, so-called friends, they would
[1:37:26] just throw me there in the in the middle
[1:37:27] of the yard. And I was all a mess.
[1:37:31] A mess. I'm telling you, I was all
[1:37:33] vomited. I was just I couldn't walk. And
[1:37:36] they just throw me there. But guess who
[1:37:38] would come out of the house and pick me
[1:37:41] up and take me to my room? And the next
[1:37:45] morning, she'll knock in my door
[1:37:48] saying, "Son, come and eat breakfast."
[1:37:52] And that love, there's something about a
[1:37:55] love of a mom that God puts that love of
[1:37:58] a mom and that was breaking me. That was
[1:38:02] molding me.
[1:38:05] I wanted to make her proud. But I had
[1:38:07] such an addiction. I didn't know what it
[1:38:10] was. Now I do. And I wanted to change. I
[1:38:15] would come in at 2, three in the
[1:38:16] morning. know I saw the TV and I see a
[1:38:18] AA meeting and I would cry by myself
[1:38:22] wanting to be have somebody to help me
[1:38:26] wanted somebody to counsel me and there
[1:38:29] was good all people around me that
[1:38:32] wanted to help me but it wasn't that
[1:38:35] time
[1:38:38] so long story short
[1:38:42] I um a friend of my older brother Danny
[1:38:46] He said, "Oh, hey, um, I want you to go
[1:38:49] up to Pontiac, Michigan." I had never
[1:38:52] left Texas.
[1:38:55] I was about
[1:38:57] 20, 23, 24.
[1:39:03] And I said, "Yes." I said, "I need to
[1:39:05] get away.
[1:39:07] I'm going to kill my mom if I don't
[1:39:10] leave. She's so just, you know, my mom
[1:39:13] wouldn't go to sleep till I come home.
[1:39:15] home and sometimes I didn't get home.
[1:39:18] So I left to Pontiac, Michigan. I flew
[1:39:21] from Texas to Pontiac, Michigan and I
[1:39:25] landed and Danny's brother-in-law picked
[1:39:28] me up. And like I said, the devil puts
[1:39:31] everything right here. He makes it so
[1:39:34] easy.
[1:39:35] And it's and he'll take from he took
[1:39:37] from 11 to 24.
[1:39:41] And I'm I'm in this house
[1:39:45] I have 150 pounds of marijuana. My job
[1:39:49] was to make
[1:39:51] put them in bags of a a pound each. And
[1:39:54] I did that and I called my my friend.
[1:39:56] Hey Danny, I got 150 pounds of marijuana
[1:39:58] already in Ziploc bags. So, okay, my
[1:40:01] brother-in-law will come down and if he
[1:40:03] asks you for 20 bags, give him 20 bags.
[1:40:05] He'll give you $20,000.
[1:40:09] So
[1:40:11] at the in a whether in a month we have I
[1:40:14] had over $100,000
[1:40:16] and I call my friend is I I have over
[1:40:18] 100 grand here. What are you you going
[1:40:20] to pick this money up? Yeah, get get
[1:40:22] your cut and they'll drop off another
[1:40:25] 150 or 200 pounds. That lasted for six
[1:40:28] months. But during those six months,
[1:40:32] I met a I met a a person that would sell
[1:40:36] cocaine up in Pontiac.
[1:40:39] And I would give him marijuana. He would
[1:40:41] give me cocaine. The cocaine I started
[1:40:44] to to to do co uh to snort cocaine
[1:40:48] because a cocaine is an upper
[1:40:52] and I was and it it would have prevented
[1:40:54] me from getting drunk. I could drink all
[1:40:56] the alcohol I want, but if I snort
[1:40:59] cocaine, it wouldn't it wouldn't get me
[1:41:02] drunk.
[1:41:05] But nevertheless, I didn't know that
[1:41:07] cocaine, you can have an overdose and
[1:41:09] your heart could,
[1:41:11] you know, it could explode.
[1:41:14] So, one time I was doing so much
[1:41:15] cocaine, it was probably like a week
[1:41:18] that I hadn't slept and I was just so
[1:41:21] high on cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol.
[1:41:24] And I remember just sitting down and it
[1:41:26] was looking outside and it was there was
[1:41:28] snow and I remember I just felt a
[1:41:31] started sweating, sweating, sweating. I
[1:41:34] ran outside
[1:41:36] and I was having an overdose and one of
[1:41:39] my friends there was gave me a Nyquil or
[1:41:44] or milk and that lowered it down and I
[1:41:47] didn't die and I said I'm never going to
[1:41:49] do this again. I slept for a day or two
[1:41:52] and guess what? I started again.
[1:41:57] Anyway, that stopped.
[1:42:00] Danny said, "Hey, you need to come back
[1:42:01] to Texas. Somebody got some money. They
[1:42:03] were not supposed to. Come back." I
[1:42:06] said, "What? Back home? Live with mom
[1:42:09] and dad? No education,
[1:42:13] no money.
[1:42:16] You see how the devil works?"
[1:42:19] But he did give me something. The devil.
[1:42:22] He gave me a $300 cocaine habit a day
[1:42:26] plus the alcohol and the marijuana. What
[1:42:28] do you do? What did I start doing?
[1:42:33] I couldn't control it. It was
[1:42:34] controlling me. I started stealing from
[1:42:38] my loved ones. I I had no money. I would
[1:42:40] go into stores and do beer runs.
[1:42:45] I was hurting everybody that loved me.
[1:42:49] I started
[1:42:51] uh smelling. I had no more drugs. I had
[1:42:54] no money. I saw a gasoline tank and I
[1:42:57] just start uh inhaling the gasoline. Any
[1:43:01] type of buzz that I could get. I was
[1:43:04] being anointed by the devil
[1:43:08] because he wants to kill and steal and
[1:43:10] destroy.
[1:43:11] But I didn't know. I didn't have a clue.
[1:43:15] So in 1995
[1:43:18] back home
[1:43:20] remember a person under the influence of
[1:43:21] drugs, alcohol, he is no longer in his
[1:43:24] five sense in his five senses.
[1:43:27] You can end up killing somebody and you
[1:43:29] have no recol of it.
[1:43:32] I remember so many times
[1:43:35] I would wake up in a city jail not
[1:43:38] knowing where I was at. I had to call
[1:43:41] the guard and tell him, "Where am I at?"
[1:43:45] He would say, "You're in Portville,
[1:43:46] Texas. You're in Mallen, Texas. You're
[1:43:49] in San Juan, Texas. What did I do?
[1:43:52] What's what happened?" Well, you were
[1:43:53] drunk. They caught you with possession
[1:43:55] of marijuana less than two ounces. You
[1:43:57] were in a fight. You were doing this and
[1:43:59] this and this. It came to a point where
[1:44:02] I would black out.
[1:44:04] I didn't have no more memory. I remember
[1:44:08] to a certain point. And then my friends
[1:44:10] next day, Mike, are you okay, man? You
[1:44:12] were in your bike, you were in your in
[1:44:14] your in your ninja going 130, 140 miles
[1:44:17] an hour.
[1:44:19] I don't remember,
[1:44:21] but he was always with us.
[1:44:26] So, long story short, I'm
[1:44:29] I end up in a county jail
[1:44:32] in 1996
[1:44:34] about an hour west of Brownsville.
[1:44:38] I have long hair. I'm real I was real
[1:44:41] skinny at the time, believe it or not.
[1:44:46] But that's when I hit rock bottom. I was
[1:44:49] in this county jail, probably the size
[1:44:51] of this room. There's bunk beds.
[1:44:56] There were some showers to my back.
[1:44:58] There was a concrete table and a TV.
[1:45:02] And I remember that night I heard a
[1:45:06] voice like if it was yesterday I could
[1:45:08] still hear it. Your only hope is to kill
[1:45:12] yourself.
[1:45:14] When I heard that voice
[1:45:16] it was such a perfect timing
[1:45:20] how the devil comes into our lives in
[1:45:22] that moment in that time when you're
[1:45:25] when you when you messed up I guess and
[1:45:27] you you you just you have no hope. He
[1:45:30] comes real subtle.
[1:45:34] I didn't know that the greatest battle
[1:45:35] ever fought was in the mind.
[1:45:38] I don't know these things, but I heard
[1:45:40] that voice and that voice just was like
[1:45:44] my answer to my to my question. Was my
[1:45:48] answer.
[1:45:51] I felt like I was in the middle of the
[1:45:53] ocean and I had no life jacket. I had no
[1:45:56] more strength
[1:45:58] to float and I was just about to give
[1:46:01] up. So when I heard that voice, I said
[1:46:04] yes to death.
[1:46:07] But a part of me didn't want to die. I
[1:46:10] remember that night.
[1:46:12] I remember that night I I was like mad
[1:46:15] at God or I in such a way I said, "God,
[1:46:17] if you're real, please manifest yourself
[1:46:21] to me. help me because I this night I
[1:46:24] will I I was going to I'm going to
[1:46:26] commit suicide.
[1:46:28] I was going to get my bed sheets and I
[1:46:31] was going to cut them and make a rope
[1:46:33] and hang myself in the in the bathroom.
[1:46:37] I wanted to do one thing. I remember I
[1:46:40] cried and I cried that night. But I want
[1:46:43] I cried because I wanted to hug my mom
[1:46:46] for the last time. I wanted to
[1:46:48] apologize. say, "Mom, forgive me for
[1:46:50] everything I made you go through." But
[1:46:53] the reality, you're in a jail when the
[1:46:55] doors open from the outside and you can
[1:46:58] jump and cry and whatever that and the
[1:47:01] reality you're in there. So, that was
[1:47:04] very, very hard time for me.
[1:47:08] So, I was waiting for these two inmates
[1:47:10] to fall asleep. They were playing some
[1:47:13] cards and they were going to fall
[1:47:14] asleep.
[1:47:16] Once they fell asleep, I was going to
[1:47:18] execute my suicide.
[1:47:22] But that that night, I fell asleep. And
[1:47:26] what woke me up the next morning
[1:47:30] was the the the the
[1:47:32] doors from my cell open
[1:47:36] and entered this man about 65 years old
[1:47:39] as an inmate with his orange suit. I
[1:47:42] looked at him and said, "It's just
[1:47:43] another inmate." I went back to
[1:47:46] depression.
[1:47:49] Depression is real.
[1:47:52] It's a spirit that devil uses to kill,
[1:47:56] steal, and destroys you.
[1:47:58] But I couldn't show that depression
[1:48:00] there.
[1:48:02] I would I would run. I would exercise.
[1:48:04] And I remember that man. He entered that
[1:48:07] cell
[1:48:11] and that was him.
[1:48:14] He goes in. I see him sit down in a
[1:48:17] concrete table about 5 10 minutes after
[1:48:20] he comes in to my cell
[1:48:24] and he had a piece of paper in his hand
[1:48:27] and I tell him, "What do you got in your
[1:48:28] hand?"
[1:48:30] And he looks up at me with his blue eyes
[1:48:34] and he said, You're the reason I'm in
[1:48:37] here for. Sit down. And when I heard
[1:48:41] those words,
[1:48:43] those words had power because as and
[1:48:46] remember faith cometh by the hearing of
[1:48:49] God, the word of God.
[1:48:51] When you read the word of God, it has
[1:48:53] power. Yeah.
[1:48:54] When I heard him speak,
[1:48:57] my heart started pounding and I sat down
[1:49:00] in front of him and I thought he was an
[1:49:03] American, but he spoke in Spanish.
[1:49:08] So I said in Spanish, he told me, "Sit
[1:49:12] down."
[1:49:16] He said, "Sit down. You're the reason
[1:49:19] I'm in here for." As I sat down in front
[1:49:22] of this man on this, he's sitting this
[1:49:24] concrete
[1:49:26] table. I sit down. The next thing that
[1:49:29] happens,
[1:49:31] the discernment. I didn't know what
[1:49:33] discernment was. This gentleman who I
[1:49:36] never had met in my life
[1:49:39] started telling me things in my p that I
[1:49:41] had done in my past that nobody knew.
[1:49:45] I said, "Who are you? How do you know
[1:49:48] these things?"
[1:49:49] He said and looked at me and crying
[1:49:52] said, "My little brother, don't try to
[1:49:56] figure it out. At its time, you will
[1:49:58] understand. We must hurry up and eat the
[1:50:01] word of God."
[1:50:04] Oh, my brother, if I if only you could
[1:50:08] have been there.
[1:50:14] First time I opened my Bible, I was
[1:50:18] right there
[1:50:20] and when he was talking and discerning
[1:50:22] and and all these supernatural things
[1:50:24] coming, I just remember just crying and
[1:50:28] crying and crying. I couldn't stop
[1:50:31] crying even if I wanted to. I was crying
[1:50:35] of joy. Something that I had never felt
[1:50:38] in my life. something that no drug, no
[1:50:40] alcohol, heroin, nothing could have
[1:50:43] given me that high. There's no high like
[1:50:46] the high of Jesus.
[1:50:52] He's always on time.
[1:50:55] And from that time,
[1:50:59] I was born again. I received the Holy
[1:51:02] Spirit. But a day before
[1:51:07] the devil wanted to kill me.
[1:51:11] So I opened the Bible for the first
[1:51:13] time. He we had a Gideon Bible. Brother
[1:51:15] Alfred got a Gideon Bible. I said,
[1:51:18] "Brother Michael,
[1:51:20] open your Bible." I open my Bible.
[1:51:25] When I open the Bible, first time in my
[1:51:27] life, I'm 24 years of age. I open the
[1:51:30] Bible, it lands on Galatians 2:20.
[1:51:34] When I look at Galatians 2:20, just
[1:51:36] glows up and it say, "I am crucified
[1:51:39] with Christ. It is no longer I who live,
[1:51:42] but Christ who lives in me and the life
[1:51:44] that I now live in this flesh. I live it
[1:51:47] by the faith of the son of God who loved
[1:51:49] me and gave himself for me."
[1:51:52] And it was at that time, it was a He's
[1:51:55] always on that perfect time.
[1:51:58] I needed that.
[1:52:00] And when I heard it, I remember it was
[1:52:02] just crying and crying and crying.
[1:52:06] And it was just such a joy.
[1:52:10] And then he always said, and then he
[1:52:12] said, "Open your book to Ephesians
[1:52:14] chapter 1 and two," which I didn't tell
[1:52:18] brother Simon to read that this morning.
[1:52:21] When I read Ephesians chapter
[1:52:25] chapter
[1:52:28] Chapter 2
[1:52:30] in him. I'm reading it. Put yourself
[1:52:34] Take me out of the way. I don't exist.
[1:52:36] Try to picture what I'm where I'm at.
[1:52:39] And I'm sitting in front of this man I
[1:52:41] never knew. And I'm sitting right there.
[1:52:43] First time opening my Bible. Finished
[1:52:46] with Galatians 2:20. I'm crying and
[1:52:48] crying. I'm a mess. Brother Brown says,
[1:52:50] "When you're born again, it's a mess.
[1:52:52] Right. Right.
[1:52:54] In him we were also chosen having been
[1:52:56] predestinated.
[1:53:00] I said, "Wait."
[1:53:01] And I just kept reading.
[1:53:04] Wait,
[1:53:06] God. So, you're telling me that you were
[1:53:10] always with me? Amen.
[1:53:12] And that just blew my mind to know that
[1:53:15] there was such a God that he was always
[1:53:18] there in those times of when I had a 38
[1:53:22] and a 9 millimeter. I was in guns. I was
[1:53:24] going to drown. There's so many
[1:53:25] instances that he brought to my mind in
[1:53:28] that time
[1:53:30] and he would just remember telling me I
[1:53:32] was there. I was with you. I was there.
[1:53:34] Remember this time? Remember that time?
[1:53:36] I was there.
[1:53:38] Amen.
[1:53:39] And I was just reading and reading. And
[1:53:42] brother Alfred was crying and crying and
[1:53:43] and and and I didn't know. It was just
[1:53:45] everything everybody else there was 30
[1:53:46] prisoners. We didn't care. It was just
[1:53:49] the the anointing was there. And and
[1:53:53] then as for you, you were dead in your
[1:53:55] sins and transgressed sins in which you
[1:53:57] had you used to live when you followed
[1:53:59] the ways of the world.
[1:54:01] You know, everything was perfect just in
[1:54:04] time. Those two scriptures.
[1:54:06] And then it goes to um and then the last
[1:54:11] scripture that I that I always remember
[1:54:12] is
[1:54:14] E Ephesians uh
[1:54:17] four 4 U 420
[1:54:24] which says
[1:54:28] no it's a where it says where Jesus
[1:54:29] Christ being the chief cornerstone being
[1:54:31] built upon prophets and apostles Jesus
[1:54:34] Christ being chief cornerstone So, so
[1:54:37] I'm here.
[1:54:39] I'm having I spent the two best months
[1:54:41] of my life with this manise,
[1:54:44] brother Alfred.
[1:54:46] He was about 65
[1:54:49] at the time. He was coming from Tucson,
[1:54:52] Arizona. He was about to cross
[1:54:56] He was about to cross Mexico. I was in a
[1:55:00] certain county
[1:55:02] about an hour away from the border. He
[1:55:05] was going to Mexico to visit some land
[1:55:07] his dad had gave him
[1:55:11] and he stopped at the gasoline station
[1:55:13] in the same city where my county jail
[1:55:15] was at
[1:55:17] and they ran his plates and they put him
[1:55:20] in that jail for misidentity.
[1:55:26] But that was the bridge that God was
[1:55:29] using for me, not just to come to the
[1:55:32] Baptist church or to the whatever
[1:55:35] denomination
[1:55:36] straight to this beautiful and awesome
[1:55:39] message.
[1:55:42] Brother Alfred
[1:55:44] when he was 19, he was in the apostolic
[1:55:47] church. He tells me these stories. I
[1:55:49] spent two months with him and then God
[1:55:52] gave me the last years of his life with
[1:55:54] me, too.
[1:55:56] He said he was his mom his mom was in a
[1:55:58] wheelchair for 20 years and they were
[1:56:01] living in California. Can't remember
[1:56:03] what part.
[1:56:05] And he said invited his mom and his dad,
[1:56:08] "Mom, dad, you want to go to the ser
[1:56:11] this man uh um preaching on divine
[1:56:14] healing?" Dad said, "Nah, you take your
[1:56:17] mom. I'm going to stay home."
[1:56:21] Long story short, after the service,
[1:56:23] they get back home. The father sees his
[1:56:27] wife after 20 years come walking through
[1:56:29] them doors.
[1:56:30] Hallelujah.
[1:56:31] They went to one of brother Brandham's
[1:56:33] campaign
[1:56:34] and she went through that through that
[1:56:36] healing uh prayer service
[1:56:39] and brother Alfred is telling me all
[1:56:41] about this. He's crying
[1:56:43] and the father gives himself to the Lord
[1:56:47] and brother Alfred has a he he um
[1:56:53] he that's where he gave himself also to
[1:56:56] the message and God used him in many
[1:56:58] ways and forms. He just had a beautiful
[1:57:00] gift that I got to see personally on how
[1:57:03] God works
[1:57:05] through man like we see all all through
[1:57:08] the through Genesis through Revelation.
[1:57:10] It's all about Jesus Christ.
[1:57:13] It's all about him.
[1:57:15] So
[1:57:17] I spent two months with him.
[1:57:20] That's too time. Is it brother Samuel?
[1:57:22] It's too good.
[1:57:23] So I'm there, right? I'm going to tell a
[1:57:26] little bit of I can't tell them all
[1:57:27] because we'll be here all day. But I'm
[1:57:30] there and uh Brother Alfred, we're here.
[1:57:34] We have two months there. And um he
[1:57:37] said, "Brother Mike,
[1:57:40] um get your Bible. Write this down." He
[1:57:43] said, "Baptize yourself according to
[1:57:44] Acts 2:38." I'm writing it down, my
[1:57:46] Gideon Bible. Um when you get out, uh
[1:57:50] look for this uh book called The
[1:57:52] Choosing of the Bride, The Rising of the
[1:57:54] Sun.
[1:57:56] Then he starts telling me about a story
[1:57:58] about a eagle, which Brother Samuel
[1:58:00] talked about it this morning. I didn't
[1:58:02] tell him about, right? and about a fish
[1:58:05] that had resurrected
[1:58:07] and I didn't know I was just I love them
[1:58:10] stories. I wanted more and more and
[1:58:12] brother Alfred tell me more. I said no
[1:58:13] no no I can only give you so much cuz
[1:58:15] then you know and um
[1:58:19] I didn't know he didn't tell me uh this
[1:58:22] is Malachi 4:5. know he had a gift
[1:58:25] and he was just feeding me a little bit
[1:58:27] a little bit and I was like I wanted
[1:58:30] more you know I wanted some meat
[1:58:33] cuz I was an eagle but I didn't know it
[1:58:35] yet
[1:58:36] but now I know it right so
[1:58:40] anyways long story short two months with
[1:58:43] him there was this there was this one
[1:58:46] man this young kid brother Alfred would
[1:58:50] snore in the morning he snore he'd snore
[1:58:52] pretty
[1:58:54] And this one young man that would wake
[1:58:56] up in the morning and he was just like a
[1:58:58] rascal. He was just bad guy. He would
[1:59:01] smoke a cigarette and throw brother
[1:59:03] Alfred in. And when I saw that he was
[1:59:05] throwing smoke into his oo I I was about
[1:59:09] to get off the cross.
[1:59:11] And that old Mike that old Mike wanted
[1:59:14] to resurrect and just I was just like
[1:59:18] oo. But God
[1:59:21] was there.
[1:59:23] And when brother Alfred woke up, I told
[1:59:25] him about him. I said, "I mean, Brother
[1:59:28] Alfred, this this gentleman over here,
[1:59:31] this guy, when you're snoring, he comes
[1:59:33] and I'm I'm going to beat him up."
[1:59:36] And Brother Alfred real calm said, "No,
[1:59:39] brother Mike is the the battle is not
[1:59:42] against the flesh and the blood.
[1:59:45] God will fight for you. remember, just
[1:59:49] look what he's going to do. Be patient.
[1:59:52] Be temperance.
[1:59:54] Said, "Brother Alfred, it's hard. You
[1:59:56] know, you're like my dad. You You know,
[1:59:59] and so the next morning, this little
[2:00:04] rascal, this guy would always wake up
[2:00:06] and just making a noise. Very annoying."
[2:00:12] Well, I didn't think about it till about
[2:00:13] 9 10:00. I said, "Where is this guy?" So
[2:00:16] I look way out there and he's still
[2:00:19] laying in his bunk and he's covered and
[2:00:22] he's just crawled over. I said, "Man,
[2:00:24] did brother Alfred he say that it's not
[2:00:26] a flesh and blood, but did did he kill
[2:00:28] him or what did he do? He's not moving."
[2:00:32] Well, all of a sudden, I remember just
[2:00:34] the the nurses, the the the medics from
[2:00:36] the prison, they just quickly took him
[2:00:39] away. We never heard anything about him.
[2:00:42] But Alfred told me, "Brother Mike,
[2:00:46] always fear God. Be humble. He will
[2:00:50] fight for us. The hand of God is very
[2:00:52] heavy.
[2:00:54] So don't just surrender yourself to
[2:00:57] him."
[2:00:58] And there were so many other instances.
[2:01:03] So
[2:01:05] one day
[2:01:07] I heard his name, brother Alfred Garcia
[2:01:09] Gonzalez.
[2:01:11] pick up your stuff.
[2:01:14] Oo. When I heard that, said, "What?
[2:01:17] What's going on?
[2:01:19] You're going to be transferred to
[2:01:21] Tucson,
[2:01:22] Arizona."
[2:01:24] And I felt like a kid, like a four or
[2:01:28] five year old whose parents just left
[2:01:30] you in the middle of a grocery stores
[2:01:33] and you don't know what's going on. I
[2:01:35] felt so alone. And I just remembered
[2:01:39] saying, "God,
[2:01:41] I want to go where he goes. I want to
[2:01:44] let me go where he goes. I don't want to
[2:01:46] separate myself." I felt, have you all
[2:01:48] watched The Lion King,
[2:01:50] the big and then the the little kid?
[2:01:52] He's like, I I felt like I was
[2:01:54] untouchable as long as Alfred was there.
[2:01:57] And sometimes I would look at Alfred
[2:01:59] from far away and say, "Man, I better
[2:02:01] think right because he can discern my
[2:02:03] thoughts, so I better start thinking
[2:02:04] right."
[2:02:06] But I felt so secure.
[2:02:09] But that moment I remembered I cried and
[2:02:13] we hugged and we embraced
[2:02:16] and he left.
[2:02:18] And I remember I just did a simple c a
[2:02:20] simple prayer in my bunk and I said,
[2:02:23] "Lord, like Elijah and Eliah, you know,
[2:02:27] they wanted to go together." I said,
[2:02:29] "Lord, give me more time with him,
[2:02:31] please." And I'm I'm crying from the
[2:02:34] heart and I just leave it at that. Four
[2:02:38] hours later, Brother Alfred comes back
[2:02:41] to myself
[2:02:43] and he comes directly at me. Brother
[2:02:45] Mike, what's going on? Like he knew. He
[2:02:49] said, "Well, the Bible says if we ask,
[2:02:52] we shall receive." And I asked for you a
[2:02:54] little bit more time. And God is
[2:02:56] faithful and he's,
[2:02:58] you know, he provides all that,
[2:03:01] right?
[2:03:03] So he said that he they put like 50
[2:03:06] prisoners in the Harlingen airport
[2:03:08] airplane all shackled up. The the the
[2:03:13] plane wouldn't start.
[2:03:17] It wouldn't start. So everybody come
[2:03:20] off, go back. So the plane wouldn't
[2:03:22] start.
[2:03:25] And I was like, "Yes."
[2:03:28] But then Alfred, Brother Alfred said,
[2:03:30] "Brother Michael, you're not alone.
[2:03:33] I can't make you. It's going to be him
[2:03:36] who's going to make you and break you.
[2:03:38] We're a whole body." He promised he'll
[2:03:40] be with you. He'll never forsake you. He
[2:03:43] will always be with you. And I just
[2:03:46] start crying when I'm hearing it. He has
[2:03:48] such a tone of voice that you just
[2:03:51] you're crying and crying, but I want to
[2:03:53] go with you. Please, you know, I don't
[2:03:56] want to be here. I want to go where you
[2:03:57] go. And so he kind of told me, hey,
[2:04:02] you're like that ego in the nest, right?
[2:04:04] You're comfortable with those little
[2:04:06] cotton there, but God got to take that
[2:04:08] out and you got to fly. You got to come
[2:04:11] to a point where we have to depend on
[2:04:12] God and have these individual experience
[2:04:15] with God,
[2:04:17] right? One of these days that's what
[2:04:20] he's doing. And we got to have our faith
[2:04:22] got to be tested and tried. So he goes,
[2:04:26] he ended up doing eight more years in
[2:04:29] Tucson Penitentiary Prison.
[2:04:33] Eight more years.
[2:04:40] Eight more years.
[2:04:43] And I'm writing to him. I have a big box
[2:04:45] of letters.
[2:04:47] And I go up
[2:04:50] and I go up to another
[2:04:53] city about four hours north of where I
[2:04:55] was to Beville, Texas. I did four more
[2:04:58] months there while Alfred separated. We
[2:05:02] separated there
[2:05:04] and I got out in six months. Two with
[2:05:07] brother Alfred, four up here north. Six
[2:05:09] months shock probation. I got out.
[2:05:12] That's a miracle in itself.
[2:05:15] If you could only know, that's why I
[2:05:17] read there is no hole. There's no
[2:05:20] situation. There's no circumstances. He
[2:05:23] is the I am. I am everything. He is your
[2:05:27] I am in every situation and everything
[2:05:29] you're going through. I was supposed to
[2:05:32] do 5 to 99 years in prison,
[2:05:35] but I got out in six months. That's God.
[2:05:40] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:05:42] forever.
[2:05:46] I don't care, Satan, what I did. You got
[2:05:49] to say that I don't care.
[2:05:54] He didn't see. You didn't do it. It was
[2:05:57] Satan in us
[2:05:59] destroying us and killing us. God
[2:06:01] doesn't see what you did in your past.
[2:06:04] God doesn't see that
[2:06:06] you didn't do it.
[2:06:09] Remember, you're at we're Oh, I wish I
[2:06:12] could just explain it, but I don't. I
[2:06:13] don't have the education. But he got me
[2:06:18] out in six months.
[2:06:21] And when I got out in six months, I went
[2:06:24] home live with mom and dad and I was so
[2:06:30] happy. I didn't have no material things,
[2:06:33] but I had such a joy inside me that I
[2:06:37] didn't have the drug, the the addiction,
[2:06:40] rehabs,
[2:06:42] NA classes, AA meetings. They're good
[2:06:45] programs, but they're not they're not
[2:06:47] good enough. Only God can do that.
[2:06:51] Only God. When man meets God, something
[2:06:55] happens.
[2:06:57] And that's what it's all about. It's his
[2:07:00] amazing power and transformation and
[2:07:03] grace.
[2:07:04] It's his predestination.
[2:07:06] So, where are we at?
[2:07:08] Where are we at today?
[2:07:11] Speak the word.
[2:07:14] Speak it. We are that spoken word. Amen.
[2:07:17] And I was I I got out. I remembered my
[2:07:22] Gideon Bible. I opened it.
[2:07:26] Baptized according to Acts 30. I can't
[2:07:29] do that now. Phone number. Okay. Call
[2:07:32] this phone number. Call this phone
[2:07:34] number.
[2:07:36] Brother answers the the on the other
[2:07:38] line say, "Brother, my name is Michael
[2:07:40] Okonnell. I was a drug addict, alcoholic
[2:07:43] uh all my life from 11:24. I landed in a
[2:07:46] county jail. I met this man. He told me,
[2:07:49] gave me this phone number, told me to
[2:07:51] call you. Here I am calling you. Okay.
[2:07:55] Well, my name is George Smith.
[2:07:58] Okay.
[2:07:59] I said, I didn't know who George Smith
[2:08:01] was. He said, well, can you? He said,
[2:08:03] well, he said, how far are you from
[2:08:05] Houston, Texas? Said, I'm about five to
[2:08:08] six hours away. He said, man, you're
[2:08:09] pretty far.
[2:08:10] Then he said, wait a minute.
[2:08:13] How far are you from Matamoto's Mexico?
[2:08:17] I said, I'm about 45 minutes.
[2:08:21] He said, I know the pastor down there.
[2:08:23] And there's families that commute back
[2:08:24] and forth from Texas to go to the to
[2:08:27] church.
[2:08:29] Are you okay? You all need to stand.
[2:08:30] You're good.
[2:08:32] Okay.
[2:08:34] All right. Remember, the best seasoning
[2:08:36] is hunger.
[2:08:38] So, I'm I'm there now. And I said,
[2:08:42] "Okay, I know the pastor. He was going
[2:08:43] to call you. He's going to call you back
[2:08:48] and um
[2:08:50] Oh, I Yeah.
[2:08:53] No. Yeah. Okay. So,
[2:08:57] anyways, so I'm there.
[2:09:02] George telling me, you know, I know the
[2:09:04] pastor is going to call you. Hold on.
[2:09:07] Yeah. Pastor calls me. Brother Tacho,
[2:09:09] the first my first pastor. I tell him
[2:09:12] exactly what I said, my testimony, da da
[2:09:14] da. Say, "Okay, I'm going to send a
[2:09:16] brother to go pick you up to go to
[2:09:17] church."
[2:09:19] They say, "Okay, thank you." Sunday
[2:09:21] morning,
[2:09:24] my mom's house, right? I'm ready. I want
[2:09:26] to hear the word. I want to hear that
[2:09:29] word that I heard through that man.
[2:09:32] I didn't trip with the vessel. I knew
[2:09:34] who was on behind the vessel.
[2:09:37] I knew who it was.
[2:09:39] You know,
[2:09:41] God is awesome how he chose people that
[2:09:44] were didn't know how to ride,
[2:09:46] uneducated, but he hid it from the wise
[2:09:48] and the prudent
[2:09:50] and he gave it to a person that was an
[2:09:52] alcoholic, a heroin addict, drug addict,
[2:09:54] da da da.
[2:09:55] He gave us revelation.
[2:09:58] Oh my god, that's a paradox.
[2:10:01] You know, I know paradox. If my old
[2:10:04] friends would hear me say paradox, what
[2:10:06] what dang what's going on, Mike? Where
[2:10:08] are you? What happened to you? You know,
[2:10:10] never heard a paradox kind of out of
[2:10:12] your your mouth. Anyways,
[2:10:16] door knocks
[2:10:19] and he open the doors. Okay. My name is
[2:10:21] Israel. Say, Brother Mike. Yeah, brother
[2:10:23] Mike. Israel. Okay. Pastor sent me to
[2:10:25] come bring you to church. Okay. Let's
[2:10:27] go. Um he go into his vehicle.
[2:10:33] meet his wife, his three children.
[2:10:36] Long story short, that brother became my
[2:10:40] brother-in-law.
[2:10:41] Wow.
[2:10:44] After church, we went to church.
[2:10:47] I heard the word of God
[2:10:50] through my pastor.
[2:10:52] And my pastor, Brother Tacho,
[2:10:56] he was a man. He was very jealous of
[2:10:58] this message. and he would preach it,
[2:11:02] you know, like it was,
[2:11:05] you know, and there's so many want to
[2:11:07] say so much about it, but I heard and I
[2:11:10] heard a man and it was just like a like
[2:11:13] another version of Alfred, but another
[2:11:16] and I just remember crying and crying at
[2:11:19] church and just God speaking to me
[2:11:22] direct,
[2:11:23] right?
[2:11:24] And edifying me and just giving me hope
[2:11:26] and all this stuff. and and in after
[2:11:30] church we go he takes me to his to his
[2:11:32] house to go eat.
[2:11:35] Okay, this is honest truth.
[2:11:38] So I sit down. It's hot back in I'll
[2:11:42] give I'll give my wife that credit. It's
[2:11:44] hot.
[2:11:45] And um I'm sitting down and I look at
[2:11:48] the kitchen. The kitchen's there. I see
[2:11:50] uh four
[2:11:52] four sisters there.
[2:11:56] Um, and then here comes my
[2:11:59] jug of bed at that time with a picture
[2:12:02] of water. Say, "Hey, are you thirsty? Do
[2:12:04] you want some water?" I said, "Yeah,
[2:12:06] sure." One sister, I was I was telling
[2:12:08] this in Oklahoma. Oh, like like Rebecca
[2:12:11] when she gave water to the camels. Yeah.
[2:12:14] Yeah, sister. But I'm not a camel.
[2:12:17] [Applause]
[2:12:20] So,
[2:12:21] so then I said I'm I was you know I was
[2:12:25] real respectful and you know and I just
[2:12:29] okay got some water and there she comes
[2:12:32] again about three four time no just she
[2:12:34] she was she was respectful she can give
[2:12:36] me water and then through the time
[2:12:40] that was a Sunday my wife tells me later
[2:12:43] that Saturday was her birthday like like
[2:12:45] like today right yesterday was her
[2:12:47] birthday and she was cutting some they
[2:12:50] were celebrating her birthday with all
[2:12:51] her brothers. There's nine together
[2:12:53] nine. And she's cutting making some
[2:12:56] cowboy beans, some chado beans we call.
[2:12:58] And her brother Israel that picked me up
[2:13:00] was got in front of her while she's
[2:13:02] cutting the the tomato and the onions
[2:13:05] and the srano pepper, all that good
[2:13:06] stuff, right?
[2:13:09] Making that sauce. and uh his brother
[2:13:12] got in here and she she started telling
[2:13:14] my wife, "Oh, tomorrow I got to pick up
[2:13:16] pastor thought she told me I got to go
[2:13:18] pick up a brother that just came out of
[2:13:20] prison." And my wife said, "It's like I
[2:13:23] I felt something for you even though I
[2:13:26] didn't know you."
[2:13:28] And my wife says, you know, there's
[2:13:30] other brothers in church. She's 24 at
[2:13:32] the time. And she said the other
[2:13:33] brothers wanted to ask her if she for a
[2:13:36] relationship, but she's her dad always
[2:13:37] told her dad died when she was 13. And
[2:13:41] uh but her dad always told her, you
[2:13:42] know, pray for your pray for your
[2:13:44] husband. So she said, I prayed from 13
[2:13:47] to 24. You know, I prayed a lot. And and
[2:13:51] then she said, the next day, Sunday, I
[2:13:53] dressed up pretty as I thought, elegant
[2:13:55] and nice, and you didn't even pay
[2:13:57] attention to me, she told me. But I
[2:14:00] said, I I wasn't looking to up to get
[2:14:03] married. I I it was it was beyond my
[2:14:06] mind. I was just happy,
[2:14:09] happy to just be delivered from that
[2:14:12] demon of alcohol
[2:14:14] to be free to have that. I was just so
[2:14:18] happy. And then I just I said with time
[2:14:21] we started speaking. I said I said,
[2:14:23] "Man, Lord, really, this is just too
[2:14:26] much. Really, who am I? I don't deserve
[2:14:31] this."
[2:14:32] And and um my wife says that her dad
[2:14:37] would always she would always real close
[2:14:38] to her dad and stay out at uh at night
[2:14:42] with her dad. Used to be the pastor
[2:14:43] before before brother Tacho. Brother
[2:14:46] Tacho was a missionary at the time. So
[2:14:49] her dad would always tell you pray for
[2:14:51] your husband. You know that God give you
[2:14:54] a good uh Christian husband that loves
[2:14:57] God because if he loves God, he'll love
[2:14:59] you.
[2:15:00] My wife said, "Man, I prayed for you."
[2:15:04] Say, "If you
[2:15:07] if I got a good husband, that means I
[2:15:09] prayed a lot of years. But if you didn't
[2:15:11] get a good wife, that means you didn't
[2:15:13] pray."
[2:15:14] Cuz I just got there in six months and
[2:15:16] we were boyfriend, girlfriend. We got
[2:15:18] married a month after that. I mean, a
[2:15:22] year after I started meeting her and God
[2:15:24] just a deep working with a deep deep she
[2:15:28] was God was working in her. God, it was
[2:15:29] just awesome how God was telling her.
[2:15:32] And then brother Tacho's h wife said,
[2:15:35] "Here comes that's uh Jookabed's
[2:15:37] husband." She said that when when I
[2:15:40] first come
[2:15:42] and then we were married in 1997. We
[2:15:45] were boyfriend and girlfriend for a
[2:15:47] year. Believe it or not, I was skinny at
[2:15:49] one time, right?
[2:15:51] We were boyfriend and girlfriend. Then
[2:15:53] we got married,
[2:15:55] right? We got married
[2:15:58] and um God gave me uh Michelle right
[2:16:02] there next behind me. Michelle, she's
[2:16:04] 26. Areli Jookobed, she's about 24. And
[2:16:09] Michael, well, he's no longer this size.
[2:16:11] He's 19.
[2:16:13] And I'm here writing to Alfred. Guess
[2:16:16] what, brother Alfred? That phone number
[2:16:18] you gave me, the guy I'm in a church.
[2:16:21] Guess brother, brother Alfred, I'm
[2:16:22] getting married. Get bro, guess what,
[2:16:25] brother Alfred? Uh, I'm having a little
[2:16:27] girl. When Michelle was born to my mind,
[2:16:32] I remember just carrying her in my arms,
[2:16:36] a little baby.
[2:16:38] And I just remember crying
[2:16:41] said, "God,
[2:16:44] the world will always judge us. The
[2:16:47] world is we will always be rare birds to
[2:16:50] the world. We're in the world, but we're
[2:16:53] not of the world. And as long as you
[2:16:56] have God as your backup, that's all that
[2:16:59] matters.
[2:17:00] God is everything. He has always
[2:17:03] provided for me. He is everything. He
[2:17:05] will always make a way.
[2:17:08] And when I carried her, I said, "Lord,
[2:17:11] I was weeping and crying, brothers." He
[2:17:13] said, "Lord, the world looks at me as a
[2:17:15] monster when they look at my all my
[2:17:17] record from 11 to 20,
[2:17:19] but you All right.
[2:17:21] You are almighty God
[2:17:24] and you is just I felt that oneonone. I
[2:17:28] felt untouchable because I knew that God
[2:17:33] had to clean me first to give me a wife.
[2:17:36] He had to, you know, it's a process and
[2:17:39] I just from there on I just like I
[2:17:42] haven't looked back. God gave me a
[2:17:45] beautiful family as you could see.
[2:17:50] You know, my mom, my dad who my mom was
[2:17:54] almost, you know, I felt the hurt I was
[2:17:57] causing though her when she realized
[2:18:00] that I started going to church and then
[2:18:02] I wasn't drinking and smoking. She's my
[2:18:04] mom loves my wife like her like her like
[2:18:07] her daughter and I made my mom my dad.
[2:18:10] My dad just called me yesterday. I
[2:18:12] couldn't see my dad eye do I when I was
[2:18:15] drinking and all and I don't blame him
[2:18:19] but he's so happy every time I go do a
[2:18:21] project I can embrace and hug and
[2:18:24] sometimes saw my dad cry because now I
[2:18:28] when I go home I try to spend as much
[2:18:30] time as I can with them these two people
[2:18:33] because I still have them in my life and
[2:18:37] my dad and my mom they know there's a
[2:18:39] God
[2:18:41] and and then there's so happy. The black
[2:18:43] sheep of the family. Here it is. Now,
[2:18:45] God has by his grace made him a a trophy
[2:18:48] of our of of his grace, right? It's
[2:18:51] nothing that we've done. So, my mom, my
[2:18:54] dad, you see there's my mom, my dad, and
[2:18:58] here's a little So, they're they're um
[2:19:03] that's still going. And this just part
[2:19:05] of my life where my pastor in Africa,
[2:19:10] you know, and God has been using me as
[2:19:12] an interpreter since then. This is
[2:19:15] brother, brother uh Warren and another
[2:19:18] brother from the Congo, Brother Stan.
[2:19:21] You know who this is? I wish I had that
[2:19:23] video. I have this clip. Me and the clip
[2:19:25] that I always carry with me. And I love
[2:19:28] the the the the interpretation and the
[2:19:30] anointing that was with that day was
[2:19:32] just God and awesome.
[2:19:35] So, Brother Alfred is in in and I'm
[2:19:38] telling him, "Brother, I'm I'm married.
[2:19:40] I got a gay." So, um after eight years,
[2:19:43] Brother Alfred gets out of the Tucson
[2:19:46] Penitentiary. He calls me Michael's not
[2:19:50] in the picture yet, but Michelle,
[2:19:52] they're young. I drive all the way from
[2:19:54] Brownsville all the way to Tucson in
[2:19:57] Arizona, Tucson Tabernacle and I embrace
[2:20:01] and then we ate some tamales with
[2:20:03] brother Alfred and we hugged and we I
[2:20:06] had a great time and we went to Mount
[2:20:08] Lemon. She showed me so he was uh
[2:20:11] staying there in the Tucson Tabernacle.
[2:20:13] I met where I met brother Green and
[2:20:16] brother Green heard about her testimony
[2:20:17] and he said where's brother Michael and
[2:20:19] brother Alfred I want them to come and
[2:20:21] give their testimony. My wife sang a
[2:20:24] song and that's when I met and I was
[2:20:27] with probably a week there with him. Um
[2:20:31] so we have a re a yearly reunion and we
[2:20:36] um I invited brother Alfred come on down
[2:20:38] we have a reunion. He came down the
[2:20:42] following year and that's him in our
[2:20:43] church and him eating you know
[2:20:49] corn he loved to eat and uh so God
[2:20:53] granted me about six to seven years his
[2:20:56] last years he granted me that time uh to
[2:20:59] be with him.
[2:21:01] He died in uh 2012.
[2:21:05] He passed away. But when he went to the
[2:21:07] reunion, the Lord gave him a sister, a
[2:21:11] wife.
[2:21:12] So, he was not alone. God blessed him
[2:21:14] with a wife. But uh
[2:21:18] um
[2:21:19] Yep. Brother Alfred, he uh was born 1944
[2:21:22] and he passed away in 2012. He's about
[2:21:25] 10 minutes from my house. I buried him.
[2:21:27] He was just like my dad.
[2:21:29] Remember, I didn't graduate,
[2:21:32] but God blessed me with a good good job.
[2:21:35] I got out of I got out of prison. I was
[2:21:37] working as a janitor. I was I was
[2:21:39] working a staff time here and there,
[2:21:42] staff agency. I didn't care. I was just
[2:21:44] so happy that I was that I was free. And
[2:21:47] then I was, you know, and I started
[2:21:50] getting jobs and always helping out
[2:21:53] just, you know, and then God started um
[2:21:56] he blessed me to go into the oil and gas
[2:21:59] business as a as a groundman, a forklift
[2:22:02] driver, and one of these guys form is,
[2:22:05] "Hey, Kano, we're going to put you as a
[2:22:06] permit writer because we got all these
[2:22:08] uh conicle Phillips operators and uh we
[2:22:11] don't speak any Spanish, so you're the
[2:22:12] only one that speaks English. you're
[2:22:14] gonna be down there trying to see what's
[2:22:16] going on. I say, "Okay, I'll be your the
[2:22:18] permit writer." And I started going into
[2:22:21] safety and and then I started working
[2:22:24] there and then I worked some pipeline uh
[2:22:28] and God has just I I just can't describe
[2:22:32] it.
[2:22:33] And remember, I do this in in in rehabs.
[2:22:37] I go out there wherever I can to to find
[2:22:41] um to find
[2:22:44] to give somebody a word of hope that has
[2:22:46] been in my shoes. You know, I give I go
[2:22:50] out there give my testimony and
[2:22:53] you know, there might be a mother that
[2:22:55] has a son in prison or somebody that's
[2:22:58] going through drugs or somebody that's
[2:22:59] going through so much. And I and and I
[2:23:02] remember when I got out of prison, I
[2:23:04] wanted to be a chemical dependent
[2:23:06] counselor and I wanted to because I
[2:23:08] wanted to help those people that are
[2:23:09] going through drugs. Long story short, I
[2:23:12] was there was a two two it was a lot of
[2:23:14] people interviewing
[2:23:16] and it was only me and another person
[2:23:19] and we were just gotten married and I
[2:23:21] said, "I got this job. I'm going to get
[2:23:23] it." And then the the ladies, the
[2:23:26] interviewer said, "Michael, we love your
[2:23:28] testimony. I believe you will have an
[2:23:30] impact on these people as a dependent
[2:23:32] counselor, one of these counselors for
[2:23:34] chemical dependence that are going
[2:23:36] through drugs and alcohol here in in in
[2:23:38] Texas. But unfortunately, we cannot hire
[2:23:41] you. Ooh, just crush me
[2:23:47] because the state of Texas won't because
[2:23:49] you got to have a very clean clean
[2:23:52] record and you've been in and out of
[2:23:55] jails and this from the age of 11 and
[2:23:58] I'm sorry I said and this other guy who
[2:24:01] just had a clean record but no ex no
[2:24:04] experience with said but I have
[2:24:06] experience with all these drugs. Come
[2:24:07] on.
[2:24:09] But you see, God
[2:24:12] knows all things
[2:24:14] because about eight years down the road,
[2:24:18] he was going to put me in refineries
[2:24:21] with people like these guys that are
[2:24:23] going through alcohol, through drugs.
[2:24:27] And God has put me for the past 20 years
[2:24:31] individually working with these people.
[2:24:34] And I just we all we got to do is be the
[2:24:37] salt.
[2:24:38] lead us out
[2:24:39] there. Your actions speak louder than
[2:24:41] our words.
[2:24:42] And they will come. Hey, brother Mike,
[2:24:44] why? You don't drink or what? You You
[2:24:46] don't party out like them guys. You
[2:24:48] don't go to these uh uh strip clubs with
[2:24:51] these guys. One guy said, "Michael, are
[2:24:53] you are you kind of like gay or
[2:24:55] something?"
[2:24:57] I said, "But you know these guys out
[2:24:59] here drinking? I was worse than these
[2:25:01] guys. I've been in and out of those old
[2:25:04] stuff." you said, "Yeah." I remember
[2:25:08] that one individual couple days later,
[2:25:10] he comes to me say, "Brother Mike said,
[2:25:13] can you can I give can you give me some
[2:25:15] advice? I can't tell my buddies because
[2:25:17] they're going to laugh at me, but I'm
[2:25:18] going through this and this and this."
[2:25:22] So, you know, God opens the way and I've
[2:25:26] witnessed, you know, it might be a
[2:25:28] little testimony, maybe some a little
[2:25:29] bit of word of God, but God takes care
[2:25:32] of the rest. Right.
[2:25:34] So, um
[2:25:37] that's that's part of where where I'm
[2:25:39] at, right? Um 2025,
[2:25:42] I haven't touched marijuana joint in 27
[2:25:45] years. It's it's something um that's
[2:25:49] amazing, you know,
[2:25:52] and
[2:25:54] um it's not about me, you know, it's
[2:25:56] about the grace of God. and and and and
[2:25:59] and
[2:26:00] I wanted to finish this real quick if
[2:26:02] y'all don't mind. I wanted to touch
[2:26:04] this. God put in my heart to to to read
[2:26:07] this and um and it's it goes like this.
[2:26:15] Um
[2:26:20] here it is.
[2:26:23] Where is it at?
[2:26:34] Okay, I know where it's at. Bear with
[2:26:36] me. Best seasoning is hunger, remember.
[2:26:43] And brother Brandon preached this uh
[2:26:47] from that time. He preached this message
[2:26:50] and I and I was reading it for the first
[2:26:52] time in my life. Hannah
[2:26:55] and u he's talking about you can ask the
[2:26:59] drunk the alcoholic when did you start
[2:27:01] drinking? Oh I never drank in my life
[2:27:04] until one night I was out with a bunch
[2:27:06] of fellows in a little celebration and I
[2:27:09] take my first drink and from that time
[2:27:14] that's the way it goes starts at a time
[2:27:18] here. Some time ago, I went to the
[2:27:20] emergency room in a certain building and
[2:27:22] there was supposed to be the the
[2:27:24] insanity.
[2:27:26] When I walked the door, there was there
[2:27:27] was a when I walked into them doors, you
[2:27:30] know, he goes into an insanity place or
[2:27:33] people banging their heads and stuff to
[2:27:35] go pray for them.
[2:27:38] When I walked in that door, there was a
[2:27:40] lovely, pretty young woman about 25
[2:27:42] years old sitting there looking at me. I
[2:27:45] said, "How do you do?" And some of them
[2:27:47] in straight jackets and beard over their
[2:27:49] face and cursing and oh, filled with the
[2:27:52] filled with that demon power. Man, when
[2:27:55] I was in prison, oh, I saw people commit
[2:27:58] suicide. I saw the devil in the flesh. I
[2:28:03] could just tell you some testament, but
[2:28:04] they're gruesome. But the devil is real.
[2:28:08] The devil is He don't He don't care if
[2:28:10] you're old or young, right?
[2:28:12] He just wants to kill and steal and
[2:28:13] destroy.
[2:28:15] And how do you know? and some of them
[2:28:16] some Drake and bearded over their face
[2:28:18] and cursing and all filled with demon
[2:28:20] power. And I looked at her. I said,
[2:28:23] "Well, it's kind of it's kindly hard to
[2:28:25] tell where to start praying first."
[2:28:28] She said, "If you don't mind, I wish you
[2:28:31] would start with me."
[2:28:33] I said, "With you?" Said, "Yes, sir." I
[2:28:36] said, "You're not a patient." "Yes, I
[2:28:38] am, sir." I said, "Well, what's wrong
[2:28:40] with you?" She said, "I'm supposed I
[2:28:43] suppose I'm insane." I said, "You're
[2:28:45] sure don't look look don't look it." She
[2:28:49] said, "Could you listen to my story?" I
[2:28:52] said, "Certainly."
[2:28:54] And she said, "When I was a young girl,
[2:28:56] Brother Brandham, I was raised in a real
[2:28:58] Christian home and I started going with
[2:29:00] a boy that smoked and said,
[2:29:03] first thing you know, I was smoking and
[2:29:05] one night he spiked a coke with whiskey
[2:29:09] and that started me drinking." She said,
[2:29:11] "I started from that to prostitution."
[2:29:14] And she said, "I lived in the very
[2:29:17] gutters of the blackness, blackest of
[2:29:20] hell." She said, she said, "I served
[2:29:23] four years in a Catholic institution,
[2:29:25] Good Shepherd's Home, and said in there,
[2:29:28] I turned a new page, and I said, when I
[2:29:31] get out out of here, I'm going to go
[2:29:33] straight."
[2:29:35] Said, "I meant it. I meant it." But as
[2:29:37] soon as I got out with the crowd again,
[2:29:40] it was all over.
[2:29:42] You know, I got out of Ehabs and I was
[2:29:44] in them. As soon as I get out, I would
[2:29:46] celebrate again.
[2:29:48] It was It's not easy. Nobody will under
[2:29:52] ever understand a drug addict, an
[2:29:53] alcoholic or a prostitute until you walk
[2:29:56] through them shoes. So we can we
[2:29:58] shouldn't judge nobody because jud God
[2:30:01] can pick up any prostitute from here and
[2:30:03] put her in here,
[2:30:05] you know,
[2:30:05] and um that just came to my mind and at
[2:30:09] home I said she was turning a new pace
[2:30:11] but when I got out of here I'm going
[2:30:13] straight. She said I meant I meant it
[2:30:14] but as soon as I got out the crowd again
[2:30:18] it was it was all over but it wasn't her
[2:30:21] time back when she would get out. Right.
[2:30:24] my time then said it was all over. Then
[2:30:28] I did two years in a woman state
[2:30:29] penitentiary here in the state and she
[2:30:32] said there I thought truly I was
[2:30:34] reformed. I come home join another
[2:30:36] church. I told the pastor we went down
[2:30:38] to the altar and talked it over. But she
[2:30:40] said I just can't keep from it. She said
[2:30:43] I started it started one night. I said
[2:30:46] lady
[2:30:48] don't you want to be a real lady and
[2:30:50] have a hubby and a babies like a real
[2:30:52] woman was? She said, "Oh, with all my
[2:30:55] heart." She said, "But look at me now."
[2:30:57] I said, "I've tried and I've tried." I
[2:31:00] said, "But you haven't tried my Lord
[2:31:02] yet." Brother Brandham told her,
[2:31:04] she said, "Yes, I have to. I have to,
[2:31:07] Brother Brandham said, I signed pledges
[2:31:09] and vows and made promises to God." I
[2:31:12] said, "That's just not what I'm talking
[2:31:14] about." And I said, "As as as
[2:31:16] old-fashioned as they may seem to be,
[2:31:18] it's a devil." She said, "I've always
[2:31:21] believed that." And I said, "He drives
[2:31:23] you to do things you don't want to do."
[2:31:26] And that's true. I never wanted to do
[2:31:28] this. I never wanted to hurt my family.
[2:31:33] And as he drives you to do things you
[2:31:34] don't want to do, she said, "I believe
[2:31:36] that." And she said, "Would there be a
[2:31:37] good hope? Would they be will there be a
[2:31:39] hope for me?" Brother Brandham said,
[2:31:42] "Certainly." And we knelt down to pray.
[2:31:44] After a while, she raised up, beautiful
[2:31:46] woman, great soft looking eyes. She
[2:31:48] looked up and the tears running down her
[2:31:50] cheek and she said, "Now, Brother
[2:31:51] Brennan, I believe I'm going to go out
[2:31:53] and make a new life." I said, "Sister,
[2:31:56] dear, you're just simply turning a page.
[2:31:58] It won't do any good." I said, "You've
[2:32:01] done that so many times." I said, "Just
[2:32:03] stay here until God speaks back to you."
[2:32:06] We go down there together and prayed.
[2:32:08] And I left her praying, went on pray for
[2:32:10] other people. After a while, she rose up
[2:32:12] and there looked around the room with
[2:32:14] those big eyes looking at me and she
[2:32:16] said, "Something happened to me." I
[2:32:19] said, "Now if you've got it, Brother
[2:32:21] Brown said, now if you've got it, you
[2:32:23] don't have to turn new pages. Now it's
[2:32:26] happened. You've got it." And from this
[2:32:28] time, she was a changed one person. She
[2:32:31] married, got a lovely home, two
[2:32:34] children. Now she can point her finger
[2:32:36] at to a time that something happened to
[2:32:39] her that was immortal. Things happen and
[2:32:43] life changes and life change. But
[2:32:46] there's there's something that can
[2:32:48] happen to a person that won't change.
[2:32:50] You cannot be the same after this
[2:32:53] happens. That's when a man meets God. He
[2:32:56] changed something. He changed. Something
[2:32:59] happens to him or her. He never the same
[2:33:02] after he once meets God face to face
[2:33:06] where he has to come to the fact to
[2:33:08] either receive him or walk away from
[2:33:11] him. He will go away a worse person or
[2:33:14] go away a new person. But when you meet
[2:33:17] God, something happened immortally. When
[2:33:21] an old blind beggar, as you can recall,
[2:33:23] who didn't even have food in the house,
[2:33:25] perhaps sat by the roadside begging
[2:33:28] blind and could not tell a daylight from
[2:33:29] dark. But then come in the presence of
[2:33:32] the Lord Jesus. He called out to his
[2:33:35] faith touched him and from that time he
[2:33:38] could see when he touched God from the
[2:33:39] time his life was changed. There was a
[2:33:41] leaper laying at the gate crying unclean
[2:33:44] unclean and Jesus passed by and his
[2:33:47] first contact with Jesus he touched him.
[2:33:49] And from that time that leprosy was
[2:33:52] gone. It was a maniac in Gdara who was
[2:33:55] so powerful possessed of the devil till
[2:33:57] they could chain him and he break the
[2:33:59] chains and cut himself in pieces of
[2:34:01] stone with such an awful man until no
[2:34:04] one could bypass could pass by would
[2:34:06] murder them if he could get a hold of
[2:34:08] them. So possessed by the devil
[2:34:10] everybody bypassed away and one day
[2:34:13] Jesus came along and from that time he
[2:34:16] was a changed man and has his right mind
[2:34:20] and could go home to his family. From
[2:34:22] that time he met God.
[2:34:25] There comes a man coming down the
[2:34:28] street.
[2:34:31] Old rugged cross on his shoulders
[2:34:34] bearing it, dragging on the back,
[2:34:37] bumping over those hard stones.
[2:34:41] It's rubbing the places meat off his
[2:34:43] shoulders.
[2:34:45] A crown of thorns on his head mixed with
[2:34:49] tears and blood streaming down his face
[2:34:52] with mockery. Soldiers spit all over his
[2:34:54] beard where their face bleeding where
[2:34:57] they asked the handfuls of beard out of
[2:35:00] his face. Old cross dragging out the
[2:35:02] bloody footprints as he walked down the
[2:35:06] street. The bee of death comes down and
[2:35:10] begin to hum around him buzzing. I got
[2:35:14] him now. Oh, on his road to Calvary,
[2:35:17] I'll get him up there. And that will be
[2:35:20] the last of the thing called Messiah.
[2:35:23] The bee of death, it anchors in
[2:35:25] everyone. But I, like any other bee is,
[2:35:28] if that bee ever stung, stings deep
[2:35:31] enough, it'll lose its stinger. Any
[2:35:35] insect or bee, if it ever stings real
[2:35:38] deep, it can never sting no more. He
[2:35:41] couldn't sting deep enough in mortal
[2:35:43] blood. But brother, sister, when it
[2:35:46] anchors when it anchored its stinger in
[2:35:50] the son of God, it took the stinger out
[2:35:53] of it. No wonder one could stand and
[2:35:56] say, "Oh death, where is your stinger?
[2:36:01] grave. Where is your victory?
[2:36:05] When death met God has lost its stinger.
[2:36:09] It cannot sting a Christian no more. No
[2:36:14] more. It cannot sting. Just believe it.
[2:36:18] It cannot sting a Christian no more. It
[2:36:21] can It can buzz and make a noise.
[2:36:25] It can buzz and make a noise, but it
[2:36:29] lost its stinger. I'm so glad. I'm so
[2:36:33] happy this morning to be a Christian. To
[2:36:36] know that death doesn't hold any stinger
[2:36:39] anymore. It can buzz and make the noise
[2:36:43] and try to stir us. But we know that the
[2:36:46] stinger was anchored in his flesh.
[2:36:49] And from that time, from that time,
[2:36:54] God pulled the stinger out of death. And
[2:36:57] today death hath no stinger. Oh, he was
[2:37:02] wounded for our transgression, bruised
[2:37:04] for iniquity. The chastments of our
[2:37:07] peace was upon him. With his stripes, we
[2:37:10] were healed.
[2:37:11] Amen.
[2:37:11] Do you believe it?
[2:37:13] Do you accept it?
[2:37:20] Do you believe it? Amen.
[2:37:23] At that time,
[2:37:28] we must have two times, right? A time
[2:37:33] we were born in iniquity and sin, but
[2:37:35] there has to come a time where we could
[2:37:38] say, "It is no longer I who lives."
[2:37:44] It's a great battle. And only God knows
[2:37:46] what we're going through and what I'm
[2:37:48] going through,
[2:37:50] you know.
[2:37:51] But I've decided to follow Jesus. No
[2:37:54] turning back.
[2:37:55] Amen.
[2:37:56] And if you read and hear that song has a
[2:37:58] story behind it where you got to leave
[2:38:02] it all, forsake it all. Those of your
[2:38:05] household might be your enemies because
[2:38:07] of
[2:38:08] him. He who does not leave father and
[2:38:11] mother is not worthy to follow me. I
[2:38:14] thought my family was going to besides
[2:38:15] my mom and dad. I thought my family were
[2:38:17] going to embrace this message. But they
[2:38:20] said your your pastor has brainwashed
[2:38:22] your mind. I'd rather see you a drug
[2:38:23] addict, alcoholic than to be a brother.
[2:38:26] It hurt.
[2:38:27] But I had decided to follow Jesus.
[2:38:31] I couldn't understand
[2:38:33] knowing where God has gave me a family,
[2:38:36] but it was religion and tradition.
[2:38:41] Do you believe it?
[2:38:44] It's not who starts a race, but who
[2:38:46] finishes the race.
[2:38:49] If there's somebody here that might be
[2:38:51] lukewarm and you want to say, "Brother
[2:38:54] Mike,
[2:38:56] at this time,
[2:38:59] if there's anybody or something, just
[2:39:02] right there where you're at."
[2:39:07] Because there's coming a day that he
[2:39:09] will rise from his throne of grace and
[2:39:11] there will be no more grace or mercy.
[2:39:13] Right now,
[2:39:14] if you hear the voice of God, do not
[2:39:17] harden your heart.
[2:39:18] God loves us so much. He wants the best
[2:39:22] for us.
[2:39:23] I never I don't deserve this,
[2:39:27] but there's something in me that I just
[2:39:30] want to shout it to the world who he is.
[2:39:33] Amen.
[2:39:34] I'm not embarrassed of this gospel
[2:39:36] because it's life to me. It changed me.
[2:39:38] It gave me a beautiful family, son and
[2:39:41] daughters, beautiful families like
[2:39:44] yourself. I may not ever see you guys
[2:39:46] again,
[2:39:48] but if we stay loyal, if we stand fast
[2:39:51] in this word, I will see you on the
[2:39:52] other side.
[2:39:55] So, I love I love you with all my heart.
[2:40:01] I don't know you, but it feels like I've
[2:40:03] known you. I feel at home.
[2:40:05] Amen.
[2:40:06] But God is always on time.
[2:40:09] He's never late. Four days late, Martha
[2:40:12] said, "Lord, if you would have been
[2:40:13] here, but four days late, but he was on
[2:40:16] time."
[2:40:18] Brothers and sisters,
[2:40:23] run that race. Sprint.
[2:40:26] Make it count.
[2:40:27] Amen.
[2:40:28] Don't let complacency set in.
[2:40:31] It's dangerous when complacency sets in.
[2:40:35] Identify those hazards. Identify those
[2:40:38] bad habits and say, "Lord, at this time,
[2:40:42] I will stand.
[2:40:44] Let it be."
[2:40:47] I'll let brother Samuel, it's a pleasure
[2:40:49] being here. Please pray for me
[2:40:53] and we can pray. We can pray for one for
[2:40:56] another.
[2:40:56] Amen.
[2:40:58] Make it happen.
[2:40:59] Amen.
[2:40:59] Make it happen. God is the truth, the
[2:41:03] life, and the way. There is no
[2:41:06] situation, there is no sin deep enough
[2:41:09] that God cannot bring you out of.
[2:41:12] I wish I could go more deep into stuff,
[2:41:14] but I cannot tell you that he grace, his
[2:41:20] mercy, his love is not sometimes is is
[2:41:23] omni is omnipotent, omniscent.
[2:41:28] May God bless you richly.
[2:41:31] I love you all and
[2:41:34] we'll see you.
[2:41:36] All right. God bless, brother Samuel.
[2:41:49] Amen.
[2:41:49] God bless. Amen.
[2:41:51] Bless the Lord.
[2:42:05] That car sure has loved this.
[2:42:08] Makes me kind of jealous. I've never got
[2:42:10] beeps.
[2:42:14] But in all reality, I know those things
[2:42:17] happen. I But um it's been good to be
[2:42:22] here in the house of the Lord. And I I
[2:42:25] just believe certainly with all my heart
[2:42:26] that God has had this to be a real
[2:42:28] moment for us
[2:42:30] and a moment of encouragement.
[2:42:32] Amen.
[2:42:33] And uh also a moment that for there to
[2:42:36] be just even a reflection in each of our
[2:42:38] lives just as brother Michael had
[2:42:40] mentioned there at the at the end is no
[2:42:43] matter where you're at, you know,
[2:42:45] everything it starts. And I know this is
[2:42:46] very
[2:42:48] um might be very simple but there's got
[2:42:50] to be a starting point and that starting
[2:42:52] point is begins with a decision where
[2:42:55] you have to make a decision to follow
[2:42:58] the Lord.
[2:43:00] You know there's a decision person make
[2:43:02] to come to church but then there has to
[2:43:05] be a decision when God begins to deal
[2:43:07] with your heart to begin to surrender
[2:43:09] your life to repent of your sins. It's
[2:43:12] like trying to hit to help the team out
[2:43:15] and hit a home run or hit a ball. You
[2:43:17] can't do that unless you get on the
[2:43:19] field. And the only way to get on the
[2:43:21] field, you've got to first come through
[2:43:23] John 3:16.
[2:43:25] Recognize what the Lord Jesus did for
[2:43:28] you. And when you can recognize what he
[2:43:30] did for you, you may say, "Brother
[2:43:32] Samuel, what do I have to stop?"
[2:43:34] Nothing.
[2:43:36] Because you can't stop nothing.
[2:43:39] I'll tell you what you do is believe.
[2:43:42] Amen.
[2:43:42] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy
[2:43:45] in thy house shall be saved.
[2:43:47] Amen.
[2:43:48] See, there's power in believing,
[2:43:50] recognizing what he did for you.
[2:43:52] Hallelujah.
[2:43:54] No matter what it is, no matter if it
[2:43:55] may not be alcohol or whatever it might
[2:43:57] be. You might be sitting here standing
[2:43:59] this morning with a besetting sin. Might
[2:44:02] just say, "Lord, help me to believe.
[2:44:04] Lord, you might try to you've tried to
[2:44:07] lay this and tried to stop this."
[2:44:09] Listen, just just say, "Lord, increase
[2:44:12] my faith."
[2:44:13] And look to him because believing
[2:44:16] releases what's needed to lift you above
[2:44:20] those things.
[2:44:21] Hallelujah.
[2:44:22] Think about what what I the scripture I
[2:44:24] just said that was in to the Philippian
[2:44:27] jailer. And I've I've read that that so
[2:44:29] many times and I've thought about
[2:44:30] brother Alfred when he came into that
[2:44:34] jail where he was and said, "You're the
[2:44:36] reason I'm here.
[2:44:38] [Music]
[2:44:40] I forgot to say in those eight years,
[2:44:44] Brother Alfred,
[2:44:51] they they broke his arm. They stabbed
[2:44:53] his heart.
[2:44:55] But he baptized over 200 inmates,
[2:44:58] guards, Indians that were reser reserve
[2:45:04] Indians. And at the he baptized one,
[2:45:07] even the prisoners, the guards would
[2:45:09] say, "What are all these people doing in
[2:45:12] your cell? Are you planning an escape?"
[2:45:16] And brother Alfred would say, "All I do
[2:45:18] is tell them about Jesus, and they want
[2:45:20] more." He had a tremendous
[2:45:24] work in the penitentiary, and it was
[2:45:26] hard what he went through.
[2:45:29] But he baptized over 200 inmates, and he
[2:45:32] told me so many stories. is that one
[2:45:34] time he bapt
[2:45:37] a Cherokee Indian and he gave himself to
[2:45:40] the Lord and the other tribe killed him
[2:45:43] the next day.
[2:45:45] It was it prison is hard. You see all
[2:45:48] you see is is demons in there. So it's
[2:45:53] pray for my daughter Michelle, my oldest
[2:45:55] daughter. She's going she's she's
[2:45:59] wavering
[2:46:03] and
[2:46:04] it's not easy. But I know that there
[2:46:07] there's coming a time that she'll have
[2:46:09] that time. And she said, "Dad, I want an
[2:46:12] experience like you had." No, you got to
[2:46:15] have your experience with God. You got
[2:46:18] to have that individual experience with
[2:46:20] God.
[2:46:22] She's my She's my daughter. her. She I I
[2:46:24] will always be there with her. But it's
[2:46:27] hard.
[2:46:29] So you could you could lie to your dad,
[2:46:32] to your mom. You could die. You could
[2:46:34] lie to hide it from your pastor, hide it
[2:46:37] from your mom, but God sees everything
[2:46:41] and he's going to have a time. You might
[2:46:44] be,
[2:46:45] she said, "Dad, I I was living a
[2:46:47] hypocrite life. I was going to school
[2:46:49] and and and and
[2:46:54] uh painting my nails and then when I get
[2:46:56] home I would so when we one time we got
[2:46:59] back home
[2:47:01] and uh we were going to church Wednesday
[2:47:04] I said Michelle you're not going to
[2:47:05] church said no dad I got a bunch of
[2:47:07] homework
[2:47:09] okay I didn't think about it we went to
[2:47:11] church me Michael my wife my other
[2:47:13] daughter coming back from church my wife
[2:47:16] said Michelle don't answer the phone
[2:47:18] she's all right she's probably asleep no
[2:47:21] there's something wrong. A mother,
[2:47:23] right? She She has something in it. We
[2:47:26] get home. Michelle, Michelle, where you
[2:47:28] at? No. Michelle, but there was a little
[2:47:31] letter there.
[2:47:34] And he said, "Dad, it's not your fault."
[2:47:42] [Music]
[2:47:48] She said, "Dad, it's not your fault.
[2:47:50] It's nothing that you've done. You've
[2:47:52] been the best dad ever. But I'm living a
[2:47:55] hypocrite life. I'm living a double
[2:47:57] life.
[2:48:00] I couldn't sleep. Michael start me, we
[2:48:03] all started crying. We couldn't find her
[2:48:05] for the past two days.
[2:48:08] And then we went to school. We found
[2:48:09] her.
[2:48:11] But it was so devastating.
[2:48:14] [Music]
[2:48:15] And then
[2:48:18] she's back at home.
[2:48:21] She's made mistakes, but I've always
[2:48:23] told my kids, you know, I'm I'm going to
[2:48:25] be your father and I'm going to correct
[2:48:27] you, but I want to be your best friend,
[2:48:29] too. And when you make a mistake, I told
[2:48:32] them because I know I made a lot of
[2:48:35] mistakes and God still loved me. I told
[2:48:38] him, when you make a mistake, use that
[2:48:40] mistake as a stepping stone to learn
[2:48:42] from it, to become a better daughter,
[2:48:44] better father, a better mother, a better
[2:48:46] husband, or whatever it is.
[2:48:50] So when I you make a mistake, I want you
[2:48:52] to come to me and I'll do that father
[2:48:54] put that father away and I'm going to be
[2:48:56] your best friend.
[2:48:58] And they have she has
[2:49:01] and so all I can do is like the prodical
[2:49:03] father and love her because I know I
[2:49:06] have faith that she's got to be she has
[2:49:09] her time,
[2:49:11] you know. So, if you're doing something
[2:49:14] or you know of somebody that's doing
[2:49:16] something, maybe doing things you're not
[2:49:18] supposed to be watching or hearing, it's
[2:49:21] going to catch up to you. So, take
[2:49:24] advantage
[2:49:25] and make it this time.
[2:49:28] You don't want to learn the hard way
[2:49:29] like I did,
[2:49:32] but some will.
[2:49:35] But I just wanted to share that, you
[2:49:37] know, I wanted to tell you
[2:49:43] just pray for me and my my family and
[2:49:46] I'll pray for you guys.
[2:49:47] Thank you.
[2:49:49] Amen.
[2:49:51] Amen.
[2:49:55] Amen.
[2:49:57] I certainly we want to I would like to
[2:49:58] sing a course here and um I want to give
[2:50:02] anybody an opportunity if anyone would
[2:50:04] like prayer. Maybe there's a heart that
[2:50:06] would like to come to the Lord like to
[2:50:08] make that decision. Maybe there was a
[2:50:11] maybe is right here this morning and I
[2:50:13] think it's it's key what he had said
[2:50:15] there too as well.
[2:50:16] Amen.
[2:50:18] Is you can't look at where where you've
[2:50:20] been.
[2:50:21] That's right.
[2:50:22] You can't even look at all your mistakes
[2:50:24] and failures. You might be a person that
[2:50:26] even like he's talked about as he
[2:50:28] mentioned there and how the enemy would
[2:50:31] get right there in his daughter's mind
[2:50:33] and you're a hypocrite and you're a
[2:50:34] hypocrite. Isn't it amazing how the
[2:50:35] enemy can try to take the word and run
[2:50:38] you down with it?
[2:50:39] Run you right away from the source
[2:50:43] that really holds everything you have
[2:50:44] need of.
[2:50:46] The truth.
[2:50:47] But you know there stands a loving
[2:50:50] savior,
[2:50:51] a living God.
[2:50:52] Amen. Amen.
[2:50:53] And he's able to do for you. We here's
[2:50:55] another testimony right here. He's able
[2:50:58] to do for you what no one else can do.
[2:51:02] You can't even help yourself.
[2:51:05] You need God.
[2:51:06] That's right.
[2:51:08] And it all starts with the surrender,
[2:51:11] with the repentance. Lord, I want to
[2:51:13] know you.
[2:51:13] Amen.
[2:51:14] I want I want to know you in the power
[2:51:16] of your resurrection.
[2:51:19] And it starts and you keep walking with
[2:51:21] him. Keep walking with him. Don't let
[2:51:23] anything get between you and the word.
[2:51:28] Nothing.
[2:51:29] You keep walking and the word of God
[2:51:32] will change your life.
[2:51:36] God's word cannot fail.
[2:51:39] It cannot fail.
[2:51:43] Amen.
[2:51:44] Let's just sing a little chorus. Hey, I
[2:51:47] I know I know it's been a longer time,
[2:51:48] but you know what? We we we've looked at
[2:51:50] things sometimes have been ball games
[2:51:52] and everything else. Foolishness
[2:51:55] for three some hours
[2:51:58] and that was that was a literally a
[2:52:00] waste. I'm not chiding you. I'm just
[2:52:01] trying to say this was life.
[2:52:04] This is a moment of life.
[2:52:05] Amen.
[2:52:06] You see sometimes even in midst of
[2:52:08] things like this, remember hunger is the
[2:52:10] best seasoning. But
[2:52:13] I'm not trying to keep you, but I want
[2:52:15] to give. If there's one that wants an
[2:52:17] opportunity, wants prayer,
[2:52:18] I'd be happy to pray with you. Brother
[2:52:20] Michael's here. We'd be happy to pray
[2:52:22] with you. I don't want to let an
[2:52:23] opportunity ever
[2:52:26] get by.
[2:52:28] Amen.
[2:52:30] Lead us. Go ahead.
[2:52:33] You
[2:52:36] made a way. Oh yeah. That's right. When
[2:52:41] our backs were against the wall
[2:52:45] and it looked as if it was over,
[2:52:50] you Lord made a way
[2:52:57] and we're standing here

[2:53:11] here,
[2:53:15] not knowing how we'll get through this
[2:53:19] test.
[2:53:23] But holding on to faith, you know best.
[2:53:29] Nothing,
[2:53:31] nothing can catch you by surprise.
[2:53:36] You got this in control. And now we know
[2:53:42] that you you made a way.
[2:53:50] When our backs were against the wall
[2:53:53] and it had looked as if it was over,
[2:53:58] Lord, you
[2:54:00] made a way.
[2:54:03] [Music]
[2:54:05] Oh, and we were standing here
[2:54:09] only because you made
[2:54:13] a way.
[2:54:16] Oh, how many glad about this this
[2:54:17] morning?
[2:54:20] Oh, and now we're here.

[2:54:29] from.
[2:54:30] Oh, yes.
[2:54:32] knowing it's because of you and nothing
[2:54:36] we've done.
[2:54:39] Oh, to deserve the love and the mercy
[2:54:44] you shown. But your grace was strong
[2:54:49] enough. Oh, to pick me up. Oh Lord, you
[2:54:54] you made a way.
[2:55:00] When our backs was against the wall and
[2:55:04] then I looked as if it was over. Lord,
[2:55:08] you
[2:55:10] made a way.

[2:55:15] Oh, and I'm standing here
[2:55:19] only because you made because you move
[2:55:24] the mountains.
[2:55:27] You cause the walls to fall with your
[2:55:32] power.

[2:55:38] and I'm
[2:55:38] there is nothing there is nothing that's
[2:55:43] impossible that's impossible with my God
[2:55:46] and we're standing here only because you

[2:55:55] mountains

[2:56:51] only because you made and this morning

[2:57:22] blood now flows through
[2:57:27] my veins.

[3:01:12] God. Hallelujah. I feel like singing
[3:01:15] that. As long as I'm alive, there's
[3:01:16] going to be shouting.
[3:01:19] Amen. Brother Michael, we'd love We
[3:01:21] we're so thankful to have you and Sister
[3:01:23] Yokabed and Michael here with us. And
[3:01:26] what I'd like to do is if you all go
[3:01:28] ahead and make your way on back there
[3:01:29] and so they can shake your hands on the
[3:01:31] way out. And uh we we'll get your stuff
[3:01:34] wherever your suit coat and everything's
[3:01:36] at. We'll we'll get that we'll get it
[3:01:37] back to you. But but you and your family
[3:01:39] and we so appreciate having them.
[3:01:42] Amen. Amen.
[3:01:47] You continue to remember them in prayer.
[3:01:49] Brother Michael, some of the he's the
[3:01:52] safety director. He started in last week
[3:01:54] when they go to idle a petroleum
[3:01:56] refinery plant, all the jet fuel and
[3:01:58] stuff like that. They have to put it all
[3:02:00] the things underground. So, he has to go
[3:02:02] in because there'll be guys going in
[3:02:03] there, welders and everything else. So,
[3:02:06] he's the safety inspector that oversees
[3:02:09] the beginning of that project and then
[3:02:11] hiring guys in, bringing them in, and
[3:02:13] it's a it's it's a dangerous job,
[3:02:17] but God has given him that job and
[3:02:19] allowed him to be a witness. And I'll
[3:02:21] tell you what's happened. Brother
[3:02:22] Michael has been pretty much throughout
[3:02:24] this nation, few places overseas as
[3:02:27] well, but to be able to take that
[3:02:29] testimony,
[3:02:30] and I'm so thankful for that. Aren't
[3:02:32] you?
[3:02:33] Amen. Amen. Let's just bow our heads in
[3:02:36] a word of thanks. Father, thank you for
[3:02:39] your mercy, Lord.
[3:02:41] Dear God, I know that I know you will
[3:02:44] and I know you have. You've you've
[3:02:46] blessed us already with your presence,
[3:02:48] Lord. May you just, Lord, I pray be with
[3:02:52] your children. I know many, Lord. It's a
[3:02:54] maybe a longer time, but Father, I just
[3:02:57] believe, Lord, as we're in your will,
[3:02:59] we're in your presence, Lord. Oh God,
[3:03:02] it's unlimited, Father, of the things
[3:03:04] that you have done and ministered to our
[3:03:07] lives. If your prophet could tell us
[3:03:09] that it would only took Moses five
[3:03:11] minutes
[3:03:13] in your presence and he learned more in
[3:03:16] that time than he did in all the time in
[3:03:18] Egypt.
[3:03:19] Lord, what has it been for us even here
[3:03:21] this morning?
[3:03:22] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:03:24] Father, to know that there's no
[3:03:26] situation too dark, no pit deep enough,
[3:03:29] and we're witnesses of that, Lord. We
[3:03:32] thank you for bringing brother Michael
[3:03:33] here with us, Lord.
[3:03:35] I pray that God may the testimony just
[3:03:37] continue to re reverberate, Lord,
[3:03:39] through hearts and lives. I pray, God,
[3:03:42] help us. I pray Lord sometimes I would
[3:03:45] say brother Alfred if he would have
[3:03:47] known that that's what you would have
[3:03:49] had him do everything he would have had
[3:03:52] to have gone through for there to be 200
[3:03:55] and more individuals that he baptized to
[3:03:59] see this here with brother Michael but
[3:04:01] I'm reminded you put Joseph in prison to
[3:04:03] preserve life
[3:04:05] you sent Paul and Silas they were beaten
[3:04:07] they went to the Philippian jail because
[3:04:09] there was a jailer down there you needed
[3:04:11] to get the gospel to
[3:04:12] That's right.
[3:04:14] You put Lord Daniel and them in Babylon
[3:04:16] because you eventually knew there was
[3:04:18] going to be some wise men and they would
[3:04:19] need to hear a prophecy.
[3:04:21] It would continue to be resounded and
[3:04:24] then when they would see that star,
[3:04:25] something would grip their hearts
[3:04:27] and they would follow that star. Lord,
[3:04:29] there's nothing by coincidence or chance
[3:04:31] with you. Help us, Lord, that Father,
[3:04:35] not only to be as recipients of the
[3:04:37] light, but Lord, to be vessels. Lead us,
[3:04:40] Lord.
[3:04:40] Hallelujah. Everywhere we go, we don't
[3:04:42] know, Lord. Sometimes the storm we've
[3:04:45] walked in, maybe every Monday morning,
[3:04:46] that might be the very day where there
[3:04:49] is an elect child of God that Lord Jesus
[3:04:52] our pathway will cross. We never know.
[3:04:56] But Father, I'd say it like this. Even
[3:04:57] if it's not someone as elect, maybe
[3:04:59] they're just ordained to a certain
[3:05:01] portion of light, may our light cause
[3:05:04] them to seek you, Lord, with everything
[3:05:07] that is allotted to them. I pray
[3:05:10] Bless your children. Bless the different
[3:05:12] ones, Lord, as we travel on the roads.
[3:05:14] Be with brother Michael and his family,
[3:05:15] Lord, through this time. We pray, God,
[3:05:18] we love you and we thank you. Bless
[3:05:20] them, Lord. And we just love you. We
[3:05:22] commit this service into your hands in
[3:05:24] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And then
[3:05:27] God bless you. Shake hands with one
[3:05:29] another as you go. Amen. Brother
[3:05:31] Michaels out there.

[3:07:48] Every day
[3:07:51] I wore a frown.
[3:07:54] [Music]

[3:07:58] troules to Jesus.
