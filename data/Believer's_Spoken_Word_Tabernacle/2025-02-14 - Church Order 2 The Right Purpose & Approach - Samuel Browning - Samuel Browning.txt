everything your children we as a people might be edified For Your Glory we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and U we want to go right into the scriptures and and uh I want to uh say it's good to see everybody we've got different ones back some of the as the young people they were um down in a banquet there last weekend and so I know they had a good time and uh we sure missed you all so good to it's good to have everyone together and I told you a few times I think there's only been a few times since November that we've actually had most of everybody together you know with sickness and everything else but I'm so glad the promise is still is still the same aren't you I'm so grateful for that so glad for God's mercy and just want to say appreciate you all and uh and it's a a cold night I'm glad we were able to get all that cleared off out of there because on this side of the building it was still just even after last night when I left out here last night it was I mean everything the whole thing was was basically ice but this part over here because the sun don't really get to it and so um just thankful to the Lord that that's all been cleared so not everybody was slipping and and things like that you know that's one thing we didn't have to worry about before with the gravel you know there's so I I kept telling my wife I said my goodness we're in a different season you know but uh you know just um the things right now I just wanted to mention this to you that you know we're trying the things that we're putting down out there and what's recommended in order to try to save us in the long run so that um uh we can eventually in a few years be able to put down some uh like ice melt and things like that but you put down salt um brother Richie put salt up on the sidewalk and up on here because that's that surface is three years old but the other surface right now it just just can't do that so we try to do the best we can and um I don't know maybe I'm just more attentive to ice now than we that we got this parking lot than I had before I don't know but I told my wife I said I feel like we got more ice than anything now and uh so I know you do probably at your houses too we we've got the same thing but anyhow it's good to be together ain't it amen sir so let's let's go right in here in the scripture and uh Brianna I'll go ahead and take it from the beginning in U in 1 Corinthians 14 I want to move back into something I um I just felt kind of break it up a little bit more here tonight I actually had a a little thought within this I wanted to deal with but I want to break it up a little bit more and and really the purpose of a lot of it I with even labeling it as Church order and then the things there these are going to be messages I believe that even as others come back in or if there's a question that arises we can go back to it I have no problem giving my notes my slides to anybody I have nothing to hide from anybody uh the problem is if I give you my outline you'll probably say Lord Lord have mercy uh because we I just want to I like to cover everything and uh but if you if you want that I'd be happy to send it to you but we just want it to be a reference point so I just you know I'm just taking it in a manner of just just ground level with things so 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 32 notice how Paul writes this and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for God is not the author of confusion but of peace and as in all churches of the Saints now that word confusion it just simply means of instability and a state of disorder God is a god of order he's a god of order it everything we we covered that last week showing that a little bit and the blessing of entering into that now 1 Corinthians 1436 right below there notice how Paul the the asserting here of what God has given him as the first church age messenger what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual that would be Spirit-filled let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant this is Paul remember he would talk about we're not going to be contentious in other words we're not arguing about things this is how it is and this is where Paul said if they choose to be ignorant of well I'm just going to do it my way Paul said let them be ignorant because remember like Abraham when Abraham gave lot a choice and he saw when something arose and he said what which way do you want to choose and lot said I'll choose this and Abraham said well then I'll go the other way way and So within this this is where what Paul is writing If any man be ignorant let him be ignorant now Paul's not saying he doesn't care about a person or individuals but he's saying if a choice is made we're we're not here to debate or we're not here to try to put points and try to convince somebody that's not what we're here to do verse 39 wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order amen and let me read this quote before I let you be seated in church order brethen brother Bram says Brethren we've called this meeting together here tonight for the purpose of knowing how that to operate the Church of the Living God which we believe to be part of this church amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated and so with this in mind this is where that even when I I think was very very um uh astute and and zoned in on this part of it that um we understand that even when we look upon this and God gave us an opportunity to where that this particular thought Church order brother Brandon would deal with this in 1958 and he would deal with it in 1958 after he come through a meeting one after another he started with why we're not a denomination laid in the doctrine and everything then he then he he preaches in 1958 Church order and then he comes around in 1963 and it's at a time that remember after the after the Tabernacle had been rededicated after the the addition the prophet was wanting to come and to and to uh work with some of these things a little bit and there was a need there was needs that was in the church now you one thing you will find and I didn't feel so bad after last week but you know it it really didn't matter to me but you know when I hear Brother brandom as I continue to go over these things where brother Brandon will say this is how it should be and he'd say well now the reason this is now it's my fault and so I didn't feel so bad but you know at any rate when I say feel so bad it's not that I left with my hand hanging down uh I I just want I to me you know what I have nothing to hide I just want to be transparent there's certain things that you real that we can do we all sometimes have been in a place that even within our Humanity sometimes maybe our Compassion or ways that we've got and we've had the best intentions with some things and then some things some of the best intentions it it things can just keep going and then it it doesn't stay wholesome with how it should be and so these are certain things that we want to just by the grace of God just holding to these things within order and the reason I say it within that manner is that I I don't believe that the prophet he brought it in a manner I don't find it in here where he brought it to be rigid but the thing that brother Brandon would would actually say multiple times within it is trying to give us a direction and say that when we would come together the whole thing that we're to do is remember to conserve your time and he would make mention you know how there's some people take a whole lot to fill up other people take just a little bit to fill up and that may never ever change that's brother Bram never came around in that quote and said well but once they get more of God in their life they'll be able to take more no that that's just not just not how it is it was just brother B said you always got to find that happy medium and so you're finding things that even that a lot of the things even the way that a service will go it's not a service you'll find some of these things here tonight you've heard me say it but I want to go into some things here tonight that it's not something a preacher does not pack the service in his briefcase so it is not that the preacher that actually makes the service sometimes I know we we get into thinking that way and sometimes we have you know our favorite preachers and things like that and we can get in such a expectation because it's our favorite preacher and and really what it is it it really is not our favorite preacher it's the expectation that we've had to hear from God that's made a difference it's it's what's actually changed everything so if we could just say Lord help me to be able to to hear and be able to have the right expectation at all times because God will speak to us through many different ways through every part of the service God desires to be able to minister to our lives even when it comes to special songs and things like that and I'm not going to deal with that tonight but even through that God has a way of ministering and it's a very important thing of ministering to needs within our lives and so God has this all together you know it isn't one thing that we can look at it that when the prophet would deal with this on confusion he would tell us certain things when you think of that word because a lot of times when we sometimes just thinking of the term confusion we just think man it's just like Mayhem but that's not that's not exactly what confusion is there can be a confusion itself is where there's a state of disorder there's where that where we we don't know the boundaries of where we're actually in at that time brother BR would it in this way he would talk to us about you know because some of the questions that were coming up in here was how that he said brother brandham there are into people that just are not able to stay the whole time and they're having to leave halfway through the preaching not because brother brand was preaching long this is when brother Neville was ministering and most of the time brother brandom said brother Neville was 30 to 45 minutes that's a goal of mine but you know he would brother BR would tell us punch it in there pretty quick and and going through that and you know there's you you learn ways and when times as I told you share with you last week when to break things up and look at certain things and so forth but he would tell us within confusion he said sometimes he said he said now if you find in your in your Tabernacle he said where you go to church he said if everything's okay with everybody just having he said a long testimony service he said that's fine if it goes good for you he said but here at the brand of Tabernacle we found that it brings confusion and then that's where he went in to state if a testimony is given let it be given in the pre-service or the preliminary or you can write it down and the song leader can re read it when he does the prayer request for what purpose to conserve time brother Bram goes on to talk about he says now as song leaders he said don't call everybody up around the Altar and you're going to have prayer and then you know you're asking who's who's got a request he said sometimes he said you get you'll give that mic away and it'll be 30 minutes before you get it back because somebody gets into the glory to God let me and brother Bram goes through that and so what he's dealing with this is that conserve the time because the main thing is the word so all everything itself it's like when brother Bram would tell us of a garden you he said like a statue set seated in a garden everything is to point and highlight that focal piece because it the word itself God speaking and ministering to our needs so all of these things working together should actually come within that Harmony this is why I'm so thankful that as we will look to God and pray as we're coming together as a body of Believers I believe that the same God that will inspire my heart or another Minister's heart to stand here is the same God that can Inspire Hearts to actually be able to say there's a special that has dropped in their heart there's something to Be Sung and then and then how this even the songs that a song leader would choose you know a song leader does not choose his favorite songs because if he choose his favorite songs he becomes predictable you see God God is God that's not work in that way he wants to keep us in a time of expectation this is why that even man I'm all I'm I'm actually in a different part right now but this is I'll just go with it as it's coming you see within a song Ser this is why that within for songs and and choosing of songs this is why as a song leader would pray trying to find the mind of God for that part of the service that he is going to be responsible for in leading in worship and and this is why even when we we look at and and you know at times in introducing new songs and and things like that and even the song leaders know I've told them those that lead right here after the service I've told him I said don't be introducing a new song at the end of service when I'm praying for people when when I at the end of the service I want the songs to be in such a place to where the people don't even have to look up here to see the words they're able to be in worship and when I'm praying for somebody do not stop a song you keep singing I don't care if it's 30 minutes long because there's sensitive needs that are being requested right here so there's just things that you know these are things that for me that as I learn as I go along through it and and I'll pass it and I and you know I want to help you know with the song leaders and things like that I'd want somebody to to help me and I know that they want to be of a real help and a blessing and they sure are and so I certainly appreciate the approach that they take you know in in in everything in in getting ready for the for the service but I want to deal with one thing here tonight actually it's kind of two parts but it deals with the the preliminary and the pre-service Really the part of it and I want to deal with the right purpose and approach I know that some of this can be seemingly very Elementary and yet sometimes it's the elementary things that we get a little bit off and notice in the Scriptures it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so it so it's together we understand that the Holy Spirit and the word are not two separate beings but the word and the Holy Spirit are one in the same and so that when a person themselves is endowed with the Holy Spirit through and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon their soul it is actually that part of the word that is dwelling within them it is God's word then on display in their life and so this is how that we worship the Lord we understand that worship is not just something that's confined to us raising our hands to us singing songs but actually every part of our life is to be a worship unto God the prophet tells us in the Hebrew series than even when we speak to somebody in the store and say hasn't the Lord given us a beautiful day might be hard hard press to find one of those days but if you look even the sun when it breaks through and brother Bram says when you do that he said you're actually worshiping the Lord so even the way that we live and we conduct Our Lives now notice these are familiar scriptures to us of Psalms 100: 4 and 5 David said enter into his gates with with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations in Psalms 122:1 I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord in Hebrews chapter 10 familiar place let us hold fast the profession of our faith faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more the so much the more as you see the day approaching so there is the right purpose there's the right purpose that we want to look at why do we come to the house of God this is it's it's so it's so crucial of why that we come to the house of God now no once again this can seem very Elementary but sometimes it helps us to revisit certain things and I believe if the Lord would place it upon our heart in this way then I believe it would be be it would behoove us just to say Lord help me to see what you want me to see so why do we come to the house of God brother Ram says we should come into church with a heart full of reverence not indifference that's good not unconfessed sins that's good we should come with a heart full of reverence church is not a social Gathering some sort of Arena somewhere to talk about what you've done through the day it's a place to worship and we've made it a house of havoc now brother BS just went through earlier Parts on this quote and he's talking about the conduct among the people and he's dealing with sunship dealing with coming into adoption dealing with many times you know brother Brandon would speak and let us know that what was holding up the adoption was behavior and conduct he would speak to us and help us to see that you know that God's desire and that's what this end time message is to do is to produce bring bring forth adopted Sons and Daughters of God not just spirit filled Sons and Daughters of God but the spirit of the of adoption that will lead us to full adoption and like we've been covering that the the new birth and the adoption are not the same thing but the new birth is that of the spirit that will lead us to the adoption but the adoption itself it's based on our conduct it's based on on our Behavior it's based on it's all of that even ascending up of the stature of a perfect man it's it's that of God working and molding and shaping and moving within our lives and there's things that God brings us to and we've got choices on what we're going to make within that hour and the prophet is speaking about things that's been given to the church such as spiritual gifts and all of these things and he said but the way that we're acting with them the way that we're conducting ourselves with them and this is why he leads to this statement of saying when we come to the house of God we should come with a heart full of reverence now watch he goes on to say in church order the church is not a general meeting house for Fellowship friendship and frolic the church is a sanctuary of God now I don't know if some of you have never seen this maybe before brother Bram they had brother BR put this in order there at the Tabernacle but it used to be sometimes I I've been I've been sometimes you know to Church of God and things like that with family and other places too and it is absolutely nothing if some of you been in places like that it's absolutely nothing you walk in the back door and you come into the sanctuary and people are just walking around leaning over pews asking hey have you seen so and so hey did you see what they did down the road the other day did you hear the road did man do you see that construction work it's just everything is being talked about right in here and so you see and and so when we recognize that the prophet is helping us to see that even our approach of our attitude and our heart within things that is a very important thing so in other words we can come here like a shell of a person where it doesn't matter what I've got in my heart it doesn't matter if I've got something against somebody it doesn't matter what I've done it doesn't matter but as a Believer this is now you get somebody right off the street they don't know no better but we know better that come here and there is such such a a coming together of such a mindfulness of how we're to come together that within this it's not a place of for a social gathering for friendship and Frolic and the church it is a sanctuary of God now brother B says if we want to meet one another let us come to the house come to my house or go into one another's house and meet one another but just to frolic around the church and talk walking and things like that it's not right brethren we come here we get the whole thing off of our mind so even when we enter in here we want to be able to even this would be an atmosphere in here that would that would help us get our minds off of the things of the world because all of us know you know it would be nice to be able to say that you know what I I leave everything of the cares of the world I leave them right there on the passeng your seat of the car but that's not true many times we are carrying needs and we've got we've got needs to hear from God we when there's Direction in our life Lord I've got decisions that I know about and you even know about decisions I've got before me that I don't know about I I I need your leadership but help me Lord in my mind to be able to lay that aside so within this this is why we even want an atmosphere here that would help us to be beneficial to ke help our minds to be able to lay that to the side Now watch how brother br will say it in God hiding and revealing in Simplicity he says now this may seem a little rude but it's not a place to visit it's a place of worship we should never murmur a word inside of here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary amen everybody with me now now let's look at that phrase a little bit unless it's absolutely necessary there's sometimes there's things that can be maybe let's say here someone comes up to sing a song and they have to whisper in the ear or or say uh mention something to one of the you know somebody playing that would be necessary but you know to look at somebody and say hey we're going to LA horn after this or you know make it out you know draw it out that that that that that goes that that don't belong in here there's necessary things like let's say for example that all of a sudden something goes wrong you know a cable comes out of the drum kit or you know a cable over here well maybe brother Tommy or maybe you know Zachary they've got to go back and figure out and and say something's going on but I've also told all of them before I don't want new things introduced up here during a service if equipment fails let it fail everybody with me now I mean we want to try to find things if if you got a question about it you can ask me about it but I don't want commotion of things going on of things within the service I mean if we just got to plug this in that's fine but even in the prior service I I've seen times right in here where there's been things take place while people are reading and praying that could be very disturbing yeah that's good everybody with me now I don't see no tomatoes coming my way if you do just make sure I get a good basket cuz I like macaroni and tomatoes but this is what we're trying to do unless it's absolutely necessary something that would be because there's certain things that are not necessary we've got the foyer the vestibule that's out there you see sometimes it's little things oh brother Samuel that's so insignificant remember it's the little foxes that spoil the vine brother BR said it ain't the big things we leave undone it's the little things he said such as he said we wonder where the blessings of God at and we haven't even been thanking God for the food we've been receiving he said sometimes just simple things like that so absolutely unless it's absolutely necessary now like I said I understand sometimes if a cable comes out and whatever more but sometimes this is where even within that of brothers and I I get it sometimes we have to they'll have to make a cable but within our minds with everything that we do we want to do everything so that where it's not a disturbance and I know sometimes that even when we've had Brothers up here and I try to make sure they know how to work the microphone I'll try to make sure it's turned on I try to make sure all of those things like that why because I don't like running back and forth and tell so I try to tell talk to him back there in the office and you know if anything at all get it go ahead and turn it on because we can mute them out here is everybody all right okay so I don't want to I'm don't want to be overreaching with that at the same time either to where but I but I also think that we need to be mindful it's like for brother Brian here brother Brian you know is one he's works with our Tech and things like that and sometimes there's things that just it it you know it takes place and it happens and it's just totally unpredictable and he has to he has to work with it but yet there's sometimes even with things when we've talked about it and just said you know what it has to wait until the next service not during service time so if we miss this we miss that but yet we're trying to get the services down we're trying to do things so when we talk about absolutely necessary I think we can understand there are things that are necessary and things that aren't brother B says if we want to visit with one another there's places that we may visit because we do not come into the sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other we come here to worship God then go to our homes this Sanctuary is dedicated to worship and he says now when we we can stand outside and talk anything you wish to as long as it's right and holy now notice how he said this even where at times stand outside and talk anything you want to as long as it's right and holy I wonder how many times that we've come here and we've missed blessings or call somebody else possibly because of how that we came oh brother Samuel I just love to see people this is now can lead me to a different subject are you a Hermit during the week and don't see nobody or do you make effort to get out and have friends outside of church oh we got quiet on that one this is the first time I see somebody they first time they let me out of my cave you see sometimes that's a whole separate thing sometimes listen the very thing brother R is speaking right here remember the the scriptures and the message is not saying that we don't come together to Fellowship we come in here to Fellowship around the word of God not with one another and I need you you need me we come together so it isn't just something I don't need nobody else no forsake not to assemble ourselves together we all have a part a contributing part within this service you might say well because I'm not the hand but remember the hand itself you could cut my hand off and I'll live but there's Parts within me that you don't even see right now if you mess with them I'll die but every part is just as vital and as important is that right so some of the times when we look at certain things like this as long as it's right and it's holy I believe we should I believe we should want to see one another I believe we should want to talk to one another but with this jurisdiction as long as it's right and holy shouldn't be even outside of there it shouldn't be talking about the latest politics woo we got quiet those are things that should be posted and the deacons are right on that to keep that in order I thank God for real Godly deacons I thank God for deacons that even that when my boys were little that they could speak to myself and my wife and speak to us about our boys when there were certain things they were doing in church I thank God for that I tell you it must have took a lot of Grace for them but you know what I'm so glad that they didn't look at the office of a pastor and say that's my pastor they also know that's my pastor but my pastor holds me with the responsibility to act like a deacon and I'm a policeman there are things that need to be served right when the order is placed within the house of God I'm thankful for men like that aren't you I'm grateful to God for that I don't look at that and than oh they're just you know they're mean no they are policemen they they must they must be able to stand on what's right whether it's their best friend or whoever it is they've got to be able to stand for what is the truth right my my my how do we get here as long as it's right and holy so I think we there are things we should know and I as once again when I say and listen friends I I think it's so it ought to be such a wonderful thing we come together to see one another man I I I love being able to come and see you all I love being able to come whether I'm preaching or not I love to be able to come and be able to see you I love the times we have the fellowship dinners but the fellowship dinners are the right time for us to Fellowship is that right see sometimes we it's almost like when if we're not careful we treat those doors like a light switch that all of a sudden when I open them doors you've been watching too much Star Trek or science fiction you don't come through those doors and all of a sudden it's a light switch it it's it preparing for service begins before we even get here it it begins before we even get here and I know we come on Thursday nights from jobs and everything else some of you come straight from your job God bless you I remember those times when I had to come straight from teaching school and step right in the pull pit I say God bless you because I know you don't have necessarily the all the preparation that you would normally have in another time but you know what God knows your heart it's a lot different from somebody who does have time for Preparation and they're not utilizing it we can go to one another's home so the prophet is about fellowshipping and I I think you know it's some things that we may have to step back and maybe I just need to take one of the young people messages and preach it here on how to make friends you know to where we have friends beyond the house of God to where what I mean is not people out there necessarily but be able to get together with one another it shouldn't just be that when we're right here in the house of God right it should be able to get together with one my good I got to keep moving here otherwise I'm going to be spending my wheels but when you enter that door be quiet he's talking about that door right there you come here to talk to him and let him talk back to you the trouble of it is we do too much talking and don't listen enough of course I know nobody has that problem here then we come in here wait on him now let me just deal with this a little bit more on the flow of service you can kind of see where I'm pulling from on this right here when we're entering in on the flow of a service brother brandom when he's dealing with pre-service preliminary these are really the three three ways he breaks it down and one of the things right now we we we dealt with that last week about even with things within you know testimonies the right times and all of those things within that like spiritual leadings and we actually went beyond that with gifts and other things like that and then you know even with this time right here when gifted individuals to meet I'm I'm not going to teach on that tonight but it but within it I want to look at this other part of it because even when you look at was Sunday school then you look at it with silent prayer meditation and reading of the word of God there's a approach to the things that we do because you know if right here if if the pre-service itself I know sometimes we years ago we you know sometimes you had people say I tell you the most important thing is the word of God now they could have a quote where brother Bram says the main thing is the word that's true but that's out of context yeah that's good everything leads up to that all of these parts coming together lead up to that then then everything is with a flow and I want you to think of it when we think of that of a flow of a service I want you to think of it everybody ever everybody seen a train before right so you know a train it it takes it takes a little bit for it to get going it's you know that's how a service is now I'm not saying when I say that that a train getting going that man it's just going to be a you know you know just a man a light swinging from that's not what I'm saying I'm talking about how the flow of the service that it keeps moving it's not all of a sudden stopping and then starting back up stopping starting it's it keeps moving God's got a direction for the service so the right approach why or what should I do when I enter the house of God what should I do now brother BR says they should come together first slip up in silent prayer perhaps at the altar for a few minutes no loud praying you'll interrupt someone else silent prayer you are in worship and let that soak in he says you're worshiping in your spirit then return to your seat or you don't even have to go to the altar just go in get a seat sit down Listen To The Music close your eyes bow your head and being silent and worshiping God all along so when we come in either we can come up here and we pray or we just get our seats and you know we're praying silently we're talking to the Lord this is the this is the purpose and the now the approach of how we're coming we're approaching the Lord this is first priority these are things when we come here this is our mind and where everything is set now brother BR says here in church order he goes on to say we want you to come and worship not like not make noise but we want you to listen to music get your seat sit down be reverent pray or read the Bible this is a sanctuary here where the Lord dwells and we want everybody to be real reverent and worship not to be running around talking before services but congregate yourselves and you come in here to talk to the Lord either be in silent prayer or read your Bible now let me ask you this right here when you go through these things and this will be things that I'll continue to bring before you there should be within this a question of why not in why in resistance but why would the prophet be so deliberate deliberate within three messages out of church order and then God hiding in Simplicity before and the dedication of of the sa the the the church before he ever goes in to preach the seals why would he be so deliberate with these things why why would the prophet deal with this about us coming in and having a time of Silent prayer just getting our minds just a a time just to be able to you know just get before God why would the prophet speak of that and admonish us not as a rule but why would he admonish us about getting here in 30 minutes and other things before why would he do that why because there's a value in getting here and getting into the channel and beginning to pray because then the prophet will take us in different places here not not tonight I won't get to it but how that all of that working together with all of these parts of the pre-service it makes it then when the song leader steps up the song leader in syn then it makes it easy for the word to come forth cu the channel has already been created so it's all a part of what's going on you see that very thing of us coming in here sometimes like I said the little things that we do or don't do is the very things that we ends up being the greatest blessing now I like I said Thursday nights uh Thursday nights a lot of times this is this is where ruggedness comes out and I'm not saying anything disparaging to others I've got others streaming there's people streaming right now in Connecticut and other places too I'm not saying anything disparaging about that but I I'm trying to say is that you know when it comes like to midweek service you've got off work you're tired school it's weary you're in a battle some of you you're stand you're here just like myself you're you know here you are you're in a place you're waiting to eat when you get out of here you've come in here and and all of it you're doing your best to get to the house of God but as we come in all that we can do I believe if we can look at it and say God I want to do my part I want to do my part I don't want to just just slip in I want to do my part now there's there's been some things and I'll just kind of be a little bit trans some some of the reasons for myself some of you have seen me come in a little bit later because there's things I don't I don't like getting caught back there I'm just going to be honest with you because my mind my when my wife we ride to if she rides with me to church together I'm one I'm focused I don't want to talk about nothing you might wonder why is because there's many times you can ask her I've told her text me this text me this there's there's amendments being made even to the notes while things are going on and we all have phones right except brother Gomez he's got a can with a string he does brother Gomez is still on moris code oh my all those cans you picking up at the flea market there I'm just PE teasing you but we had we have things and I don't say that because you know as I've told you I love I I love I love you I love you but I also realize that when I come in here within this time I don't want to I don't want to talk about anything I just want to I want to focus because there's things sometimes that some of you know sometimes when there's been maybe someone has come back and I've been in a days because my mind is on what I'm looking at and preparing for and sometimes I'm waiting for that last little bit I'm waiting for that last key I'm waiting for that last little thing to get get there and I want to I want to do my best because you know why he gave his best that's right for you he gave his best he gave his blood for us to me that's how when I look I don't prepare any different for Thursday than I do Sunday I give my all and I say that because he's worthy and because you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and I I want to just say it like this brother BR says he says now he's talking about you know sometimes you go places and you see good things you can see good things I've been in a few different places where I think brother Brandon when he's talking about this here he's pulling this example that I'm getting ready to read to you from the marble Church where Norman Vincent Peele was the great psychologist and teacher and brother Bram got in there and he's just looking how everything is so orderly the deacons are standing by the door there's people I mean people are are greeted as they're coming in there things that's very attentive and what's taking place it's not just letting people come into the building and just kind of wander around but everything is so attentive and what's taking place and what's going on I I realize we don't have to have ushers seating people in our church I I understand that we're not jammed in here but I still think that's a part of it to where when you know what it's like when you walk in you know when you walked in and when anybody comes in whether a visitor they know they've they've been noticed and also they've been greeted they've been welcomed but brother Bram heard this one what it is is he heard and I've I've been to a few I've been to a few churches and when I've been out and ministered and things like that I just kind of just watch things at at different times and just kind of observe it and brother Bram talked about how in this church he said you could have heard a pin drop anywhere in that church everybody was in prayer for at least 30 minutes before the first note ever hit the organ the Prelude everybody was in prayer and I thought how wonderful it is it was an atmosphere now you know we can brother Brown never come out and said well you know he was a great teacher he was a great psychologist teacher and then but watch he was able to glean he was able to glean and say this is what I would like to see in the Tabernacle now when you let me just pause with that you'll find that these were things that the prophet had to continue to revisit at the Tabernacle it was not something he put in place just like when he had the gifted people meet brother Bram tells us clear back in the early 50s he said I did that when I was a Baptist pastor in the Baptist Tabernacle brother Braham says if I did it and it worked there surely you Pentecostals it could work among you so brother brah was showing us that there was order but see you can find over and over it's coming back to certain things why not because we as individuals say I'm going to Rebel I'm It's just sometimes there's little there's little things that just kind of get in there you know you you kind of let you know if you let someone sing a special you know after you know at at the end of the service then somebody else can maybe not they're no one's meaning and wrong but somebody else now wants to sing and then it just now then then it becomes practice are you with me this is one of the things when I took School law and one of the things when they told us they said your practice will supersede policy if you ever go to Court your policy won't stand if your practice is against it your practice is what you'll be held for no matter what's on the books and what's written it's your practice and so sometimes in in in like I said in good intentions but things we can get to a place and thank God for his grace to bring us back on track I thank God for his Mercy don't you brother M said it like this he says I I think they played one prelude for about 3 to five minutes how great art or something like that and then when they did everybody stopped praying and was listening to the Prelude so now they're coming to the end of the pre-service and he says it give a change from prayer to the Prelude so it it changed from whatever whether brother Ram will say at times where where you have he says The Pianist organist that's playing the soft music that's beforehand so that that it creates an atmosphere of of that of worship this is you know with all of those things that that that that would be taking place within that time and then there's a change that comes right before as we're transitioning into the song service where the Prelude like you heard tonight you've heard it other times where all of a sudden brother Brian or brother Paul comes up here and they've already in the back they pray with me back there all of the song leaders and the musicians they've done that for years they come out here and from there and the time they get out here it's about 5 till and when they come out here then you'll find brother Brian or brother Paul as they're coming around then Ben they've got it going and all of a sudden they're moving into the song that's going to be the startup and that song and it's it it lets the congregation know there's a change coming see it's it's changing at that time there's a transition it's now getting ready to change from the pre-service the preliminary now coming into the song service and so notice when brother Brown would speak of the blessing of this right here within it he says when a minister walks into a congregation where people are praying and the anointing of the spirit you are bound to hear from Heaven there's no way to keep from it but if you walk into confusion you're so confused and the spirit is grieved and we don't want that and as I said I I don't want to get off on song services but brother brah even said that sometimes he said we can drag that out too long and it kills it I've I I've set in in actual camp meetings where all of a sudden it was special after special after special and uh I never forget when uh brother Harold hilderbrandt he came out he was the speaker it had been the service had went I I'm not exaggerating I think an hour and a half we were tired you're sitting out in the heat open air and brother Harold hilderbrand steps out this was wisdom brother Harold at that time I don't know how old he would have been but you know um some of you know brother Harold he steps out and he looks over Brother Bruce jakowski and he says Brother Bruce come here he had Brother Bruce step up there and he says with his trumpet he said just play only believe he said I don't want you to sing I want you just to listen and Brother Bruce began to play only leave with the trumpet and I'm telling you there came such a refreshing of the Holy Spirit came right in there but you see what wisdom was because the main thing was the word and so he reached over he could have tried to come to the pull pit at that time he would have been a flop but he reached over and at that moment is to try to kind of recalibrate some of those things you know and so those are things sometimes we learn we we come into that we learn as we go brother brandom even told us when he's dealing with this in church or he said look he said I've been he said preaching he said for 33 years he said there's some things I've learned he said that I just want to you know be able to pass on so let me just try to let me just try to tie this up here tonight and really in this way with when we come together the scripture tells us that what a what a privilege it is blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places now I'm not going to put this on the screen but brother Brown I just want you to listen what he says here in the adoption part one and he says here we are positioned in Heavenly places in Heavenly it means the position of the believer he says that is if I'm prayed up you're prayed up the church has prayed up we're ready for the message we've assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in Heavenly places we're heavenlies in our souls and our Spirits has brought us into a Heavenly atmosphere oh he said what could happen tonight if sitting in this heavenly atmosphere where the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted setting in Heavenly places bless blessing us with what Divine Healing forn knowledge Revelation Visions Powers tongues interpretations wisdom knowledge all the Heavenly blessings and joy and speakable and full of Glory every heart filled with the spirit walking together setting together in Heavenly places not one evil thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another everybody's speaking in love and harmony everybody with one Accord and one a place and suddenly there came from Heaven a sound of a Russian Mighty Wind brother B said oh it's not telling what the holy spirit will do in that meeting so sometimes even within as our per as the purpose we come we come here to meet God we've got there are there there are serious needs and it's not just us who are coming but sometimes you have individuals once in a while sometimes you can have you know not even you're not even expecting like here on Sunday we had brother Joy's um son one of his sons visit and I didn't I didn't know that was taking place and you know just pray for them there you know his desire is to is to to be back and and so to you know to come to the house of God and but these are these are things are individuals that here when they come in Among Us there's certain things that they don't know there's certain things that they you know haven't heard they they have they don't understand all these things like this but this is is where that for us coming in with the right purpose and the right approach it creates the right atmosphere for what God might do this is like why one of the reasons where brother Ram would say it over and over why he wanted the meeting of the gifted one separate he said because if it's done here in the congregation you can have individuals that don't even know what that's about and they can say things against it so this is when so you find Within certain things why once again why would brother Bram go into these certain things why would he say that and you know and and everything like this and and certainly you know brother bradam was not talking about locking things up in a in a door some in a in a in a back room because the real reality friends when we think of this with even the gifts within the church the prophet said there ought to be the nine spiritual gifts in every assembly and as I've told you before I've had that quoted to me and I've heard it quoted to others many many times but really one of the things you find that that that what people are looking for is the only thing that could actually be noticeable is tongues and interpretation all of the other gifts gifts of healing wisdom knowledge discernment all of those are higher than tongues tongues is the least that's right that's that's the least yes but see this is why that the prophet was helping us to see it's not things that we're we're we're not it's not seeking after gifts seek after The Giver it's after the giver and this is why that when we look at these at these parts and let me just maybe just kind of give you a little bit of a a little little foretaste of where I'm going to out end up going here the first priority for our walk in our lives and where we come into the house of God let me just let me just read read this little part and then I'm just going to fade away here brother Bram says I think first that every member every worshipper of the brandham Tabernacle should be so much in Divine love with each other their hearts would long for each other when they have to go away to leave each other at the service at night I am a True Believer in Divine love that's one of the things where the Prophet starts first this is why that brother BR would say it over and over he says if God asked me I'll make you a great person I'll give you every single gift or I'll give you divine love brother Bram said I wouldn't even have to think about it I'll take Divine love because event eventually all the gifts will cease when I get to when we get to the other side I'll never have to study for another message I'll never have to pray and be down and and sweat and which way do I go on this you know what it would have been done it was it was done it was reserved within time it was needed but when we get to the other side all of these things it'll be worth it and you know what just to think of it if it'll be worth it then what about every service now just a little bit you you know you think about it and remember the times brother and you remember that when the Lord brought you and sister Amanda back Among Us you remember that when the lord gave us a little bit of a direction was a little different for me and I sent out an email to everybody about how to prepare for those services and we had those Services come in here God did some marvelous things among us wasn't because of the preacher it was because of the expectation some of you understand what I'm saying it was because the expectation among the people where where habits were broke things lives and and things like that were change because it's the word that holds transforming power and to think of what God did within that that time what God will do when we come with an expectation the just the right purpose the right approach I say God help us help me Lord help me to lay aside help me to anything that anything that needs to be cleared out anything laid aside I want I want to be sure when I enter in here that I'm ready as a vessel to be used whether I'm used within ministering may not even stand behind this desk but I'm going to be part of pulling on the gift of God I'm going to be part of praying that there might be somebody else's need that gets met in that service and just our little just our little bit of time of coming together getting our minds set right and getting the attitude and getting everything just set right all of those things right there my it's hard telling what God will do like the prophet said when you take a minister That'll Walk into a congregation where that's taking place it's unlimited of what God will do you love him let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I know Lord these are very simple principles Lord that you would take us on even of what I had down lord and looking at things and you help me to see that this is where Lord I had to move some things aside and move it to another time but Lord we I believe within this of looking at it I'm I'm speaking Lord to brothers and sisters those that are here those that are streaming but help us Lord to be Lord when we look upon these things Lord that we would esteem it and forgive us Lord where we've in our shortcomings Lord dear God we're in sometimes it's just habits lord it's things that we can so easily get into Lord and before we know it Lord it just becomes a way of life but father would you help us Lord if the prophet would tell us at the beginning of the new year of how to make reading our Bibles and he would say it this way a habit even of Prayer of how to make it a habit Lord help us I believe Lord we've experienced many of us in many different ways the value of these things Lord I've Just Seen just the little things that it's not even noticeable it's not even something where anyone's even standing on the pulpit at that
