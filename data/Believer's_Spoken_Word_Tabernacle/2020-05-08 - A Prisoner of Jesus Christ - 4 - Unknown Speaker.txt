Oh God we're not looking at a type but God we are worshipers in the Anna type Lord in Christ and our hearts desires in you Lord this is who were looking to Lord we're looking to you O God that you

one of those prayer requests Lord that was mentioned here tonight Lord they've been lifted up before your throne and those in every unspoken request Lord we lift them up Oh God for Lord you said ask the Father anything in my name and I'll do it and Lord we believe that Lord we are witnesses of that Lord and this is our desire that you would just come Lord fulfill your word minister to our lives now Lord we pray in a personal way in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen god bless you tonight we want to just invite you into the scriptures there too Philippians chapter 1 and verse 18 and I'm just going to read just a few verses of Scripture and then we will let you have your seats and we just certainly just looking to the Lord for his mercy and His grace we want to look here back in the scriptures tonight into verse 18 of Philippians 1 and here are Paul writes now remember what we're we were looking at this last week Paul is coming out of where he is it let them know that there is the gospel or Christ is being preached but there are different motives and objectives that are even behind and the governing of Christ being preached but I believe that within this scripture here we could just take this scripture and just just preach on the rest of God because the reality is when Paul when we look at how Paul's response is to this it was not something that was lacks it was not something that Paul just said oh well we'll just let it blow over but you know in every situation the the pattern that we have there's many patterns that we are a pattern that we have as believer but you know we we look for the unction of the Holy Spirit it's not just to do something because this was done before but you realized that in this particular thing right here where Paul is writing Paul is not worried and he's not anxious that to me when I think of it in terms of being a minister of the gospel this is a messenger of the age but look what rests that he had he had such rest for he said what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached and I therein do rejoice yay and will rejoice may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated tonight I in looking at this here there are things that we see in the other epistles as well as what will come out here even within that in the in the letter to the Philippians a church where Paul will deal with those and dealing primarily with looking at the objectives and the motives that are different then what the real objective that Christ sets in the heart of a believer and this is why over and over we we must have the discernment of the Holy Spirit this is why we cannot just judge by outward appearance we cannot even just judge by a person's speech but you see the thing of it is neither does it cause us or is God saying to us be tense about it and second-guess everybody because remember you can be so conservative that you can grieve the Holy Ghost so what does that mean it means don't have any confidence in our flesh but knowing this right here that God is leading and directing our life and surely we are trusting in the Lord that God will open and reveal those things to us if there's anything out of line this is the rest that I believe that Paul here is he's speaking of this in verse 18 the approach that Paul has taken and I tell you we need the wisdom of the Holy Spirit in every situation on how to approach every situation whether it's in the family whether it's in the church how do we approach it there's times that when as you know we've looked at this there are times with under even in every marriage and every church and every life you operate under the under the anointing of the Holy Spirit but the four characteristics of lion that of ox that of man that of Eagle there's times we we need with a boldness to stand there and roar like a lion then there's other times we need to have that of the Ox where we lay down our will lay down our opinion lay down this we have to have that sacrificial part of an ox there's other times we need that of the man wise as a serpent harmless as a dove be slow to speak swift to hear there's other times when we need that of that of the Eagle where there is a catching away where there's a moving if there is a translating that takes place the power of God comes on the scene right there to be able to govern that situation to govern our lives so in all things this is why I say that our confidence and our rest should be in the Lord and I don't believe that we should be anxious in any in anything the things that I believe that longer that we serve the Lord you begin to find more and more God is not looking to your eye that we would have to try to have all the answers for every situation but what's important is is that you are in contact and United with him who is the answer of all things because he will lead and guide it this was the promise he gave us he said I'll lead and guide you into all truth and so in situations arise we are looking to God for his wisdom and remember Paul even on his departure as we looked at last week when he would talk to those at Ephesus and let him know there are Grievous wolves that's going to enter him there are men that are going to rise up from among you speaking perverse things but notice Paul did not you know so focus around that he let him know this is what's going to be but in his departure he said I commend you to the word of grace which is able to build you up and he told the Cong he told the Brethren the elders this was the pastor's that he had gathered together there and how the Prophet had gathered those pastors and let him know take heed so now notice take heed this is what's going to take place but the way to combat this is that the people would be so place within Jesus Christ that's the combatant it isn't having the pastor on speed-dial it isn't having the pastor on your text thread or having him that he liked you your page on Facebook that's not the way we combat the enemy but remember to combat the enemy is to have the soul of the Holy Ghost on the inside of your life that you know and you're persuaded that he is able to keep that which you committed against that day we we we are to be soldiers in the army of Almighty God so the things that I'm looking at here is where that in in in in the scriptures of how that Paul is resting here in verse 18 in the situation that is taking place that regardless Paul's rejoicing that Christ is being preached now you know when I read the scripture even looking at it some you know weeks ago and and I thought about it we understand many times that there can be lives and different ones things that will come in among the message and we've seen it for years and you know as it would come in and sometimes where others have other objectives other than the real original jekt objective of Christ and yet you know sometimes you can see that where those spirits would come in and they want to be frak tisha s-- or divisive and you'll see it come in and there's many things that I have witnessed of different brothers and pastors where I've stood in their pulpits overseas to where that they would tell me after a time of how that there were you know pastors in the locality that would say don't go hear them don't go to their church they teach this and they teach that and they teach this and come to find out eventually those people they get they would start hearing the revelation of the word that was being preached and when they started hearing it there was something about it they said man this guy's not a devil what I'm here and this is truth man this is this is liberating it's setting me free you see what it comes down to do is that a sheep is always a sheep when they hear the voice of the Shepherd sounding in that clarity it's something about it that will ring in their heart and I believe that where Paul is standing in this moment here of verse 18 Paul is standing in a confidence that God has control in this situation Franklin there wasn't anything blow can do about it and let me just tell you something this is the life of a prisoner of Jesus Christ there is some sometimes we find ourselves trying to make things happen trying to solve problems and it isn't for us to solve them it's God is the one to solve them many times it's for us to wait in patience and look for the leadership of the Lord and waiting on him and sometimes that's very pressing because even within ourselves it's almost like we want to solve this or I want to solve this but God has everything in control oh my now notice how Paul takes this here let's look at this for a few moments in verse 19 Paul goes on to say for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope than in nothing I shall be ashamed nothing but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death look at this is a life when when we're looking at this remember this is a prison epistle and I don't mean to be redundant with that comment but I want you to understand there are things that are being even expressed here that we see in the life of Jesus Christ that exemplifies what it is to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and this is where Paul what he's expressing is in his own life right here here was one think of Paul's life I like how brother branham goes through it he talks about his life remember he was a student of gamelon they didn't have student loans in that day his parents had to save in order to send him to study under Gamaliel there was a reason this was not daddy's ambition this was Paul's ambition and Paul had a desire one day that he was going to be high priest you see this is where a prophetic I can look down into the into these parts Paul had an ambition Paul had an objective let me just say it to you like this you would not have looked at Paul's life prior to his conversion and said that guy's a bum that had just floating around that guy's haphazard Paul's life one life that Paul had a centered life Paul's life was one that Paul if you talked to him he knew what he wanted in life Paul knew what he was after in life he had an objective there's nothing wrong with having an objective and a go let me just pause here a minute and preach a little bit we realized that we are living in the end time is that right we even see conditions that are upon the earth but let me just say this to you right now and I just feel pressed to say this to the young people those here and those watching I want you to understand this and catch this if if listen this message when God sent this message to you and I this message is an announcement this is the beginning of the end is that right we recognize what's going on but listen at the same time the balance within the message is how the unction would minister to us and say that if I knew Jesus was going to come in the morning I would prepare to preach the message that he laid on my heart what was the Prophet saying do not lay around and say well we're so close to the coming of the Lord I think I'll just you know kick my hands back what's the use of going to college what's the use of having an objective what's the use of prayer of what career that God would have for me what's the use of even looking at getting married no man knoweth the day nor the hour and I'll tell you right now there's been a lot and I'm not just going to say it was preachers there's been a lot of individuals that have taken hold of this message and instead of actually setting things in the right direction they did not hold a balanced I'm not criticizing him but I'm saying if there had actually been some more straightforward teaching and exhortation on this there's some people that wouldn't be in the mess that they're in tonight because there is a balance that comes with this word is that right there is a balance that comes with this think of this what if what if I in my heart what if my daddy had preached that what if he had labored on that at home and said hey son the coming of the Lord so close at hand you don't even need to go to school you don't even need to worry about this you don't even need to worry about that I'm gonna tell you right now and we'd have been in trouble now I know people always want to take more on unaware know where I'm going with this but I know people always want to take a quote and say well you know about the same my brother man told us about that woman you knowing that man in the boxcar I understand what he said but it's also the condition of times that was during the Depression you understand that the Prophet himself never ever told us not to get an education but he said don't let it be your God it's just like this man I could have studied a few more years I would have been a PhD had a PhD a doctorate in administration but you know it was still if I would have had a PhD as I have a master's disease I do not understand God but my master's degree or my bachelor's degree I do not find the leadership of the Holy Ghost because of my knowledge within this of earthly things those are things that God has allowed me in order to provide for myself and to my part in the economy of God God already the college didn't put those skills in my life that God packed them in my life it was those things that had to be revealed that's right in the book of Exodus God does not put you here in this earth without packing skills in you when you come here for them to be unpacked that was three so you say but the same no what are you saying I'm saying now to have a clear objective Paul had an ambition he had an objective he had a will he had something that he was driving the only thing of it is is that what Paul was after in that he was wanting to serve God but he just wasn't taking the right Avenue and God had to help him because knowing Paul's heart that Paul's heart's desire was to serve the god of his father's but yet the Avenue or the pathway he was going it would never be able to actually satisfy the thirst that was down there but God in His mercy because it was not us that found God it was God that comes searching for us so God came right down there and he moved upon Paul's life one who was filled with ambition had objectives he had his will it was set but what he met that day on the road to Damascus it cost him to put a pause on everything else he had Paul said at that point in time Paul said you know what I'm gonna put a pause on this courtship I'm gonna put a pause on you understand what I'm saying Paul put a pause on so many other things why because he knew there was something that he had meant he had met the Lord on the road to Damascus and Paul did not start out that very moment saying hey I met the Lord I met the Lord no he went and studied for three years you see what you find in the life of a prisoner is a life that seeks to be grounded in Jesus Christ that's a real blessing that's the reality that every one of us must have is that grounding that solid mist that plays where you can put your foot on that you know what you're talking about Paul did not just take an experience and go by and experience you see this is where that every ministry is to be paralleled after the pattern that God set with Paul that is why that the prophet of God under inspiration in this hour wouldn't reach clear back there in that rebuilding of the temple and he would liken it to that as Aruba mo remember zerubabbel is one that would hold the plumb line zerubabbel is one that had the measurements that was there spiritually speaking here to understand that in order for Christ Himself to come and dwell in the midst of a people it must be a body that is God constructed in order for Noah in order to say to move above the judgment waters it was not just any boat would do it was not just any boat it had to be a God constructed pull of a pattern that was spiritually revealed to Noah so notice we're polar Paul is that Paul actually loosened listen to me now the authority of the revelation that had come to Paul actually gave him the authority Hogue glory be to God what he met on the road to Damascus it gave Paul authority to loosen himself from every ambition and instead Paul was united with this revelation of the love of God in his heart brother you couldn't get this revelation out of his heart it begins to display itself in the life of Paul it's what caused Paul to forsake all of the teaching that he had his degrees all of his learning it was that where Paul was a smart man Paul could speak in many different languages and yet Paul look at the humility of Christ that has moved in a man that could speak such eloquent words words of wisdom but yet Paul when he said when I come among you I do not want to speak any of these other unknown tongues I could speak in ten thousand tongues but yet what would it profit you but except that I would speak that you might have understanding what did that it was the humility of Christ that Paul was yoked to he had become a prisoner oh what a wonderful thing it is to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ well in that Paul would write whether I live or whether I die we know for a Christian you can't die once you've died you've already died all death does is pack you're right into the presence of God but Paul here's here's Paul's determination but I'm not going to be ashame I'm expecting deliverance let me just tell you something right now if you get sick if anybody was to get sick at all you have every right as a matter of fact you've got a charge from the Word of God to expect healing because it is packed from full of healing and if you are a member of the body of Jesus Christ by the Spirit of God you've got a right to stand there on those Covenant promises and claim what belongs to you Paul had every right right here to say according to my earnest expectation and my hope that I'm gonna be delivered I'm gonna be set free I'm gonna be delivered back to you all Paul was not talking down in the glooms although no doubt he had certain days when he was there that might have been down days and up days and down days just like you and me but once again that's the life of a prisoner reminds us of this prison cell that were still in now look how Paul would go on to right here in the in the book of Philippians in the same chapter and I want you to notice the same perseverance the same persistence the same determination that Paul had even in a situation that Paul did not know how it was going to come out Paul did not know when he wrote that then I'm gonna be delivered or I'm gonna be coming back to you all or I'm Paul didn't know that but his expectation was I'm gonna expect deliverance why should not you see even when Paul was in the ship prior to this remember it looked like all hope was lost but the angel of the Lord showed up right because remember why the purpose of God was not finished in Paul's life now notice this here in verse 21 or if we could just keep that in mind tonight in our lives it doesn't cause us to act foolish but is to understand it helps us so you're not walking in fear that there's absolutely nothing can take you I don't care what new virus comes out I don't care what no do not disease come along there is nothing that can stop the perfect plan of Almighty God there's not anybody that God says oops uh uh huh you know I wasn't expecting this is gonna take them off the scene it does not make us act foolishly but it does as we are going about and doing the things that are right it gives us a confidence as it should even when you get behind your car or you're getting the airplane wherever you go you need to have that kind of an assurance that I'm not going anywhere until God is finished with me and just hand the devil that fear say here you can take this this come from you this ain't from the kingdom that I'm born from you can take it I don't need it because then ain't serving me well verse 21 for to me to live is Christ you know Paul was saying if I get out of this prison I'll live it's Christ see this is where that motives and objectives the Spirit of God will search ran around in a service and brother Branham would take us right in the message I've heard that now I see he said when many people want to get well but why do you want God to heal you he said do you want God to heal you so you can keep on doing the same thing or what is your motive and objective in it is your motive and objective to glorify Him to say God I'm on my whole life to be healed not just my body I want myself to be healed now listen your soul might be right in step with God but why do you want healed do you want healed to say Lord I want to lay before you I want to be able Lord to give more of myself to you you see there's got to be a right motive and objective if there is not the right motive and objective then we cannot have faith the Bible said if our heart condemn us we can't have confidence this is part of our prayer in order for faith to have a channel to operate by it must be by the right motive and right objective so Paul was saying for me to live is Christ and to die is gain I'm not losing but if I live in the flesh don't you just love how Paul talks about it Paul Paul talks about the flesh the way that I would look at my coat and Paul just says if I live in this you see once I'm once this thing is hung up right here this coat is not me the real me is beneath that coat and Paul said if it's if it's needful if I'm gonna live in this flesh look if I live in this flesh this is the fruit of my labor what's going to be my fruit Christ what's going to be the fruit of my life this is where Paul is determined yet what I shall choose I want not all said I don't know what to choose for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you this is a prisoner it would be easier for Paul to say Lord take me on home you remember brother ban him in the adoption series he began he was talking you know in that way and he said the Holy Spirit spoke to him and his brother man was talking about Lord these trials are so hard these tests are so hard and he said when he begin to go on like that I'm just one man I want to go on home Lord and he said the Spirit of God spoke to him and said are you trying to bypass them death is not to bypass problems the death of a believer is that of a graduation it's a saint of God that has overcome and it manifests and and fulfill the purpose of God and now there is a graduating from this life into that where they've lived from and for nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you and having this confidence I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith so why what what is it that the desire to abide is for the furtherance of your joy of faith glory that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus class for me by my coming to you again look where the fault is that here is a man who is in bonds he's chained has a soldier right there in his hired house and here who's he thinking about who's he praying about even within this first chapter Philippians it has nothing to do with himself even the decision I don't even know what decision to make to go on with the Lord or to stay here for you but as he moves around to it the decision is always about what is the most going to be the most beneficial for you the body of Jesus Christ you see this is what the revelation of Jesus Christ does it puts the burden and the love of God and it reveals the mystery of the body of Jesus Christ because the body of Jesus Christ is not a church building the body of Jesus Christ is not even a group of people the body of Jesus Christ is the mystical body that is made up of spirit born filled believers that are under the blood of the Lamb there has to be an induction into that body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost just being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ does not in-depth you into the body of Jesus Christ you are there confessing your sins you've come into fellowship with the believers with the Saints but remember there's got to be an induction you have been baptized identified with your sacrifice and then looking to that of the sanctifying power that's in the blood to remove all the desires and habits uncleanliness out of your life why what's the objective is because I want to be baptized into the body of Jesus Christ man can baptize you with their they'll put you down in the water but it takes the Spirit of God to put you in the body of Jesus Christ you see here's a choice and you know when when we've been redeemed we no longer on our own choice Christ is our choice now I want to just just labor here just a few moments in this verse of scripture that we're looking at because the theme continues on in this of a prisoner Jesus Christ you recognize that as we look here in the scripture Paul admonishes now notice how he spoke of the things that are going on now he turns his attention and he's addressing to the body of Jesus Christ with that same persistence he says only let your conversation that means your life your life reflects what you are a citizen of that's what it's talking about your conversation only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ but whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your affairs so there is a life that is being lived and on display remember Paul when Paul would stand there before Ananias remember Paul would have a testimony that is that ball could write of how that I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day that's a powerful thing because it's one thing to be before people but here was a testimony Paul could say before God you see it's one thing because man's eyes could see one thing remember there were even those in the Corinthian time that in the book of Corinthians that were writing you know my they were reading Paul's letter remember they were writing man this guy's a mighty man wow man he must be quite a speaker quite a man in stature Paul shows up and you know what they're there and their complaint is that said the man is Madi and speech but his looks are contemptible is that right and what did Paul say Paul's addressed to that within those things as he said we'll see when I come who is mighty now Paul listen Paul was not being you know aggressive what Paul's really attention to the church he said the weapons of our warfare are not carnal what was he doing he was trying to let the people see that it is not the size of a man it's the size of Christ in that man go look on the stature of man Samuel almost a night that the wrong one to be king close he was looking on the stature of man to know somebody he was still under that kind of an influence and that kind of a thinking but all my by being a prophet of God he was separated under the Lord and the Holy Spirit could speak to him and say not him not him not him Samuel thought it was this is surely the one this is surely the one this is surely the one what was it it wasn't that Samuel got this one wrong or that went wrong or that went wrong that's not what the focus is the focus is that even when Samuels thoughts were inclined a certain way he allowed his thoughts to be overrode by the mind of Christ brother that's what a real prisoner is that allows our mind to be overrode by the mind of Christ and so Paul he would Paul would have a life we would see that would be a life he Paul would ride in gang you know he would call the witness among the Thessalonians among the Corinthians there in 2nd Corinthians 4 in different places Paul even in Galatians Paul would call the attention of the believers to the life that was lived before him even of how he would say to the Thessalonians he said you seen how when we come among you we were as a nurse with children what was he saying we took you and nourished you nursed you has upon the sincere milk of the word to do what that you might come to a place of maturity in your walking in your life there is a goal and a focus within the gospel well may God help me to make this clear tonight notice he said this is what this is a conversation that become at the gospel of Christ that I want to be able to hear that you stand fast that means you're persistent you're standing firm you're persevering in one spirit with one mind striving together not at one another striving together for the faith of the gospel that's first what's Paul doing he's letting them know this is the objective that's been the objective of his ministry Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever me just tell you something that is not just a words from a scripture on a tape case that is to be the insignia and inscription on our hearts in our homes in our lives that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever glory that you stand fast Nepal would admonish in many places about standing fast but you realize but the random wouldn't read it like this because look standing fast in one spirit right here among us just with a little handful of people that's here that's been man in the battle stations from the beginning just that just the 8 of us that's been here including myself listen we all have different makeups we all within listen our human spirit were different Paul is not talking about human spirit and not simple he's talking about one spirit this is where you're standing in that of one spirit with one mind one objective it is the faith not a faith but the faith of Christ and I tell you what brother man it would put it just like this in the Queen of Sheba he said it takes more than the power of gifts it takes more than joining a church come on somebody it takes more than that it takes the birth of the Holy Spirit to break down our walls and to unite us together as one great Christian body moving for one objective and one go we can come and sit right here and not be one we can come and sit right here and not be one let me just put it to you very clear we can come and sit here and we within ourselves can be in one mind in one Accord and we're stealing one whoo they went into the upper room the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ he assembled them according to the promise but they had to go get what the promised promised to them you with me it had to come to a place to where they would be one with him this is the objective of the gospel anything outside of that is nothing less than membership it's all it is and you know what it displays itself but so does the genuine birth display itself as well Oh Simon what are you talking about I'm talking about heartfelt religion that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about hearts that got Jesus Christ beaten on the inside where Jesus Christ is the objective of that life that's what I'm talking about Paul was talking about standing fast in one spirit this is what Paul was talking about remember there was intercessory prayer that was made and I just have to refer to this Jesus remember in John 17 as he is praying he's praying as he says in verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they may be one as thou father art in me and I am V that they also may be one in us notice the oneness as thou father art in me and I am in thee you see the father listen to me now Jesus was always the word but when he received the spirit when the father came in him what did it do it quickened the word that was laying there and it put him in the word the word was no longer letter the word was made flesh that's what the Holy Ghost does in the heart of a believer it makes the word flesh that's the real oneness outside of that it's not oneness the disciples walk with Jesus this with Jesus talked with Jesus maybe covered him up when he laid on the boat but they want one you can come to this church you can do everything in the world I trying to discourage nobody I'm trying to tell you don't let the devil rob you of what God's desire is you understand fast in one spear take your inheritance the Holy Ghost belongs to me hallelujah the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I am them notice I am them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one this is the completion that the world may know notice that the world may know that thou has sent me and has to love them as thou has loved me the reflection of the unity of Jesus Christ in the life of a believer let me just say this to you this body belongs to you I'm quoting without reading it directly this body belongs to you but the heart is to belong to God the heart is the control tower of man that's where God brings the headship of his word listen this flesh in itself ken is not a place to receive the headship of the word I'm talking about the flesh the spirit all that that makes up it's got to come to the heart let me tell you something it can it can fall in many different places but if it's no more than just an acknowledgment of truth if it's no more than just a membership then that is not what Paul is talking about and maybe you say it right up front don't let the devil give you any excuse don't even don't even take his excuse well brother Samuel I don't understand that the reason the reason that you can't understand it is because you've got to be born of the Holy Ghost when you're bone of the Spirit of God in the eyes of your heart become a 9 10 then you can see the kingdom of God then you see the plan of God then you see the program of God if not if not this church is no more to you than just a social gathering come on somebody those are in your home's you ought to be shot in your shoe heels off these are promises that God has given to us what good would it do to have a whole congregation 1 and here we are one and yet lacking the real objective in hearts and lives who sent me one who's saying I'm telling you it goes beyond I and I admonish and I agree if the love of God's in your heart you ought to be in the house of God but let me tell you something it is something more than just faithful church attendance you've got to have a meeting with Jesus Christ to where you have got the overcomer the inside and you have received the strength of an overcomer and been you're an overcomer it causes you to be persistent for what the objective of Jesus Christ devil can try to try to sidetrack you here sad track aver sidetrack you there but you're standing fast in what spirit one mind striving for the faith of Christ reminds you the Bible says in the last days Paul would write of it how peerless times would come men would be lovers of their own selves he would also talk about that men like Janice and Jen Rees he talked about how they would you know come in they would creep into houses and lead silly women laden with divers lust you know he's dealing with and Jenny's and danbury's are anointed preachers the Prophet tells us very clearly in Christ the mystery he said they can build a church brother they can get a group of people together come on now you see they've got charisma they've got pull to get a group of people together let me just drop this into you real quick I believe that this is one of the things that why it's necessary that we have to have the leadership of the Holy Spirit because it does take the Holy Ghost to keep a group of people in harmony in United and look into the objective of Jesus Christ but we don't need individuals coming together and just trying to keep a group of people together we need the Holy Spirit in the midst of his children leading his church on in the promise of Almighty God that's why brother Graham said a man ought to have an absolute and he brings that absolute over the congregation and he says he preaches that absolute still every member comes in step with that word but the sudden you keep preaching the same thing if you miss the life you miss it all and how much knowledge you have if you miss it every lesson on a point out the life of Jesus Christ every message ought to bring conviction to hearts it ought to challenge us in our walk with God it becomes nothing more than forms of God forms of godliness but denying the power thereof that's why it takes more than just being associated with this a message that ain't the holy ghost but salmon I dress right I do this right it's deeper than that it's deeper than that well I know this and I know it's deeper than that you gotta have a revelation and a relationship with Jesus Christ to where you've got one objective let me just tell you something right now I don't care how Eva any of us are you might be look how brother man talks he told us in stature a perfect man he talked about all those virtues he said I know people with these virtues in a natural realm now what he said he said I know people with Tom what the statue of a perfect man he said I know people in the natural that have these virtues very patient very this very that but we're not talking about what's in the natural we're talking about what is spirit given spirit born and you know in those virtues display themselves when you're in the midst of trials that's when the life displays itself come on now because you just don't stand there and put out when you're on the mountaintop and say I'll put out a little bit of patience why do you need patience when you're on the mountaintop you need patience when you're in the valley fruit don't grow on the mountaintop fruit grows in the valley this is when the virtues come forth Oh glory be to God think of this now here you find that the people of God here they were gathered together after Pentecost they were brought together one mind one accord so that's very important you remember let me just say this to you let me just I want to say this just to settle that point even down further because it does matter that we are in one mind in one Accord that's why it's important that even when we come to the house of God that you get your mind together come on now just don't expect just to show up or when you sit down and watch your house and honey uh hem in the napkin I like my face your brother Samuel is now on the monitor you ought to get prepared come on now you ought to get prepared to say I'm coming to the table of the Lord [Applause] prepare all the way it ought to be will clear that when you're here let me just tell you something I I made across the table for many of you but even if you ain't Nate across him from me you know brother bill by looking at me when that guy goes to the table I know he means bidden I can tell by his stature and if you don't know my wife can tell you after breakfast I want to know what's coming for dinner I understand and this is what I'm trying to say it ought to be something clear in your life nobody gotta talk to you they ought to be able to see Jesus Christ here's the pulsation of your life my lord we might just we might have just eight people again next Thursday but this is the reality we need to be in one mind in one Accord yes sir amen to get into a place what so that the Holy Ghost can move among us mrs. Lyons and told us in greatest valor fault as he talks about the Stars how the unity with among them and then how it's reflected up in the earth he said if we can get in the Holy Spirit he said if the Holy Spirit can get this congregation this morning listen can get this congregation into one mind and one Accord in harmony he said they'll not be one person sitting here but what wouldn't be filled with the Holy Ghost they're not me that's wanting it that's wanting it that's wanting it he said they'll not be one person that's sick in their body but what wouldn't be healed what is that that releases it it's being in harmony and unity with God or tell you it ought to be something about it that we ought to pinch ourselves and we ought to say Lord forgive me if I the coach coming to the house of God or every day if I've lived a haphazard Christian life you all repent and say God help me to live on more curve and focus dedicated ambitious filled life of Jesus Christ mother samuel that will make people want to come but it'll make the elect thankful to the lord because this is the desire of the let this is the desire of the believer oh glory one purpose you see god promised he would restore that bring it back to that real Pentecostal objective oh my this is where as the Scriptures it would admonish us here in in our walk with God notice how Paul would write let me just kind of bring this down in Colossians 3 just skip some in Colossians 3 verse 1 look at this objective if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God this is every promised he has ascended up and seated on the right hand of God this is the meta toriel seat this is the atonement come in to view it and unfolds to us these scriptures what rights what redemptive rights belong to us look at the admonition if you therefore be risen with Christ then seek those things which are above you see the Spirit of God listen friends the Spirit of God knows God knows this is why we need the admonition of the live Ministry of the word because you can't put you can't stop me you can't pause me you can't fast-forward me and you can't rewind me you can't do that because the Holy Spirit takes control and what does he do brother Graham tells us he comes along and as he begins to deliver that word he catches where we are over to where we need to be this is what / comings about he said he also catches our thinking where our thinking might be off a little bit and he said the preaching of the gospel will put our thinking back on Christ where it needs to be I don't know about you but I'm so thankful that many times where I've said I maybe I've been listening to a message or I've been sitting right here or been in other meetings and maybe there's things and I'm praying about maybe it's problems back here in the church maybe there's other situations I'm praying about how do I approach certain things even in in a personal life and family and other things and I'm waiting on the Lord but oh my and sometimes anybody ever got trapped in your own way of thinking here it seems like man I don't see any way out of this but along comes the Spirit of God he begins to break that word and you could have read that word and you didn't see that but immediately when the Spirit of God gets ahold of that word it's just like the Red Sea goes to pardon it's like the Jordan goes to opening and you begin to receive the dew and the sweetness of the honey from heaven and right there even though you got to face the problem but you've got assurances the thinking the mind of Christ has moved down and you like Samuel like Paul and like every the rest of them have a your mind to be overruled by the mind of Christ that's when the supernatural comes in seek those things which are above so it just shows us that this right here it's going to take some effort this is admonishing us seek those things which are above we walk in this life we live in this life we have things on our phone reminders send this bill out tomorrow reminder transfer this money tomorrow reminder do this oh yeah I got an appointment on my calendar we we have things to do in this life and yet we're admonished by the word that has poet admonished the Corinthians we've got to live in this world but they said don't abuse it live in but don't abuse it let Christ be the focus of your life set your affections on things above that's your thoughts your mind your focus not on things on the earth I want you to catch these scriptures right here these are not things that Jesus is going to do for us he won't do it for us he's already done for us what was needed now he speaks to us you set your affection on things above not on things on the earth immediately this is what we're talking about a life that is focused in on Christ for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God what a paradox here we are brother bill dead hidden we are dead but yet we are alive in Christ when Christ's notice who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory not maybe not might happen not it's possible the guarantee is is because you already have this seal we already have the assurance but you see it calls us if the ofoh 'kiss has got a little off you see a prisoner of Jesus Christ is not altogether that someone that can't get out of focus or out of line but a prisoner of Jesus Christ is one when the Spirit of Christ God will make known and begin to deal with their heart by the word it might be something they don't even realize they've gone out of line or it might be something that they're praying and saying lord why is that it just seems like your presence is far from me it may not have been that you did anything it might just be God being silent about a time in your life to see how you're going to stand but you see a prisoner of God a prisoner of Jesus Christ is one who's able to be corrected it's one whose yoke the Spirit has yoked them into the word and they're able to be corrected let me just give you a few examples as I close here tonight we'll just stop here you think of those who are in the heroes in the Hall of Fame you think of that of Abraham you think of that of Noah you think of that of Enoch you think of all of those different ones even as the Bible can talk about in the book of Acts I love how it's wrote regarding David in the book of Acts it said Davis David served his generation by the will of the Lord he served his generation what was it he served the purpose the generation he was living in by the will of God by serving the will of God he served his generation how many of them Abraham Noah you think there were times that they got down there were times that they did go down but they did get down but notice what was the difference Christ was their life when it came down to certain things they had everything it was being funneled through Christ the revelation they had in their life they were as much as could be in that time under that allotted portion that they would have were the Spirit of God will move down on their lives they themselves were locked in to that revelation like Noah building the ark building there and laboring notice brother Branham would let us know he was not an engineer he was not an architect it would be like calling me to build a building but we'd be in trouble you and one asset under it much less stand near it but God God called somebody that did not have any abilities to do what he called him to do how many times we don't have it in the scripture where Noah got down and prayed said lord I don't know what to do here I don't know how to I don't know how to make these these ends meet right here I don't know how to bring this together Lord how do I do it it kept knowing listen the revelation was sure in his heart that's why he could pray the way he prayed same thing with Abraham same thing with the rest of them you see this is why Paul is admonishing the first admonishment he gives here to the people of God sister Roseanne go down to those last verse of scripture would you let me read those let me read verse 27 again if I could only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I might hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel now notice where he goes now and we're closed and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them and evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of God I think brother bill maybe you have the story a little bit better than I do and I think brother the sound were told a story the one time where there was a group of ministers or group of people from I don't know Bible school or wherever it's from but the point of the story was these rebels stopped that bus they made every one of the ministers get out and here's what they made him do they said you either spit on your Bible or we're going to kill you every one of them spit on their Bible except one the god said kill every one of them except this guy because this is the true one you know why even in a pressure situation you can't get it out of his heart that's a real prisoner of jesus christ in nothing terrified by your adversaries let them breathe and bro and I'm gonna get you fired and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that hold your peace don't let no guile be found in your mouth or your spirit hold your peace and go to God in prayer because that to them is an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of God for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which you saw in me and now here to be in me who's Paul riding too the Saints of Philippi the same Saints that the earth quaked the prison bars were hoping Paul and Silas were set free they could have went the rest of the prisoners could have went but instead they stayed because that was what God had him do there was a Philippian jailer that needed to be led to the Lord Paul was letting them know hey just because Godding brought an earthquake down here in Rome and set me free we're not defeated God did it that time in that situation we were there for a purpose and a need and just as he wrote to him earlier in this chapter the bonds in Christ are being made manifest in all the palace what's keeping your Paul I'm standing fast how by His grace Paul do you ever get a little down yeah there's sometimes I get down well what it encourages you or like David I begin to encourage myself in the Lord I begin to remember I was on the wrong path way and he came to me Paul what happens to it when sometimes you you feel like a little weak when I feel like a little weak I remember how many times that he's come to strengthen me Paul how do you know that even in this that you're not going to be killed well there's been other situations where my life's been up against the wall I know sometimes it hasn't been real glorious of my Exodus out of the city I know it may not be considered to be great and glorious and miraculous but I was grateful for the basket I was let down by what was all of that all of those things in that way it was to show humility let us not get in such a way to where things have to be this way have to be that way we all believe in the pattern and the working of the Holy Spirit but the way God answers prayer the way God comes and performs his word that's God will always come according to his characteristics may God help us as an assembly to stand fast in one spirit and I urge you tonight if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's what I'm preaching on this is the spirit that were to have because he won't do no good to take one another spirit you can have brother Samuel spirit and act like me I don't know why in the world you'd even want to come on now why would you why would you set up for something like that receive the Spirit of God then your United with Jesus Christ then it brings a real oneness with the body then though we all might have our own little opinions about something our own little ideas we've got a greater objective on the inside that we can look and say you know what that's my opinion but I ain't letting that get in the way of the body that's what the working of the Holy Ghost does in our heart when we've got the real Pentecostal objective it gives us strength to be able to lay down our opinions because we have to in order to be united your loving father we just thank you tonight Lord Jesus to see what you have you promised to us in this hour you promised by way of your word we see dear God to where that men Lord even as we Lord different times I'll see certain headlines or see things and different ones are calling for a revival and all these other things and yet Lord God it's the same thing what they did with John as Jesus would say they did to him whatsoever they listed to realize the Lord God that father they could feel the pull of a revival they can want to do something I think that Lord to me I think it's great like I look at David all it was a great thing that David wanted to do Saul had forsaken the Urim and the Thummim but David said hey let's bring it back David had the right motive your prophet told us he had the right objective but David's way of going about it was not according to the will of God was it the will of God for the ark to come back into Jerusalem it was but it must come according to the word or Jesus even though David had the right motive and objective but it was not according to the will of God it cost a man his life [Music] and when the word came back around through Nathan a prophet he would take him right back to the word he let he let him know that revival it must come according through the word that inspiration must follow the channel of the word Lord Jesus even inspiration that moves throughout the congregation we believe Lord God that inspiration is to move according to the Word of God the Holy Spirit will never behave himself unseen the Holy Spirit will never draw attention to himself he'll never edify himself he'll never edify anything other than the kingdom of God help us your Jesus or now crave it for each and every one the Lord would be streaming under the sound of my voice your God for those that would look to me and call me their pastor that would call this their home church I ask right now Lord God let there not be one of them just be a member of this church just belong here that'll do him no good it's not just because they've got generations well my grandfather came here my daddy come here no that won't do you've got to have your own experience now maybe you can look in your life maybe the examples you've seen in front of you maybe they've come here to this church but maybe all they've been is up and down and up and down well I pray that God would so settle them and anchor them give them that real first that real feeling that they are looking for but what about you you don't have to live an up and down life you don't have to live a church life where the only thing is you're associated around a move of God why don't you let the Holy Ghost move in you why don't you let him move in you and move down in your life and let him birth you into this word into the body of Jesus Christ why don't you be willing to say Lord I surrender my ambitions I surrender my will I surrender all my objectives Lord God let it be one objective in my life let it be seated on the throne of my heart to control every action every thought let me be a vessel that is available then when my own thoughts get to rolling a certain way that my life can be moved upon by the mind of Christ and his mind can move down and override mine Lord Jesus granite - where Lord it becomes the message itself Oh God as your prophet told us in what house will you build me he said this message is not just to be the flame of the hour it's to be the flame in our hearts it must be in our hearts or we can't rightly represent it to the people or Jesus this is that conversation that life that Paul was talking about this is where Lord it's not begging people to serve you it's not Megan Lord but it's something arises from their heart they want to please you it's where an objective is so taking a hold in our lives that's greater than our own wills it's greater than our own opinions it's greater than our own ideas it's Jesus Christ oh god no wonder has Paul under inspiration would write to let this be the focus this would be the same admonition that Jude would write from when he would say I find it necessary to write unto you of the common salvation that she would earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints your God we know it's nothing new it's been going on your prophet has taken us through the word to show us Satan's spies as Paul would talk about previous wolves would infiltrate the ranks of our message and would want to leave the people away from a real genuine life of Jesus Christ or God what good does it do to half members what good does it do to have a group of people just to have people or Jesus this is not your desire your prayer is fulfilled for that oneness when it comes to that same oneness where you are in us and we are in you puts us in the word that's a real one that sets the grounds for fellowship this is then where we can fellowship or I pray tonight if there's any Lord where their focus has gone a little off maybe they've got entangled Lord you wrote to the Galatians they had got entangled there's certain things that they had got entangled they have been removed from the spiritual now they were dwelling back around in carnal things what if the focus has been lost how Lord God I rests Lord Jesus in your spirit to deal with each of our hearts if there's anything that's out of line if there's anything that's been set before you Nord God even if we've put family ahead of you then we've got the wrong order nothing should be ahead of you you should be the head of all things you should be first priority with decisions that we have to make it always got to be Christ is the center of every decision or Jesus help each and every one of us as your children help us Lord may you move for every heart right now Lord God behind every uplifted hand as they're gathered there in their homes around the computer tablet phone those that Lord will archive it later those of us gathered here Lord Jesus this is the one spirit we want to stand fast in one mind striving for the faith of the gospel it shows there'll be opposition and there is but Lord God may we strive with that unity of purpose if we've got one objective one goal and that's Jesus Christ and Lord God it'll help us through every little thing that the enemy would try to bring a throw away if we've got the right objective in the right purpose granted Lord we pray in Jesus name I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to the Lord sing I love you no see Oh No singing [Music] you my Oh [Music] you know Mitch lightning I sing a song I sing at a song Gigi in moments like I lift up my hands yes I lift up my hands true soon singing I love you see [Music] yes while singing [Music] No

[Applause] or pure and holy well tried and true oh thank you [Music] Oh a shoe a for yes or no to be a sanction Oh pure and holy well tried and true [Music] [Applause] ore sanjou air oh my I hear the Prophet answer a question in questions and answers on the seals and think about I want you to catch this what has unfolded there that week the prophet has preached the six seals to know there's a great thing that's taking place you know different ones that were sitting there when it was being preached and you hear their testimony they said we know something great was going on but we just didn't know what was taking place and now I want you to catch this here it is questions and answers on the scenes the questions are answered by the random room with where we're at should evangelists go out how does brother Branham respond to him he takes a whole thought within that and he ties it together like a farmer planting potatoes and he said you keep planting potatoes you live you plan for tomorrow but you live as if he's going to come the next moment this is what the scripture is talking about who thought we would be here in 2020 come on now who thought we'd be here in 2020 that's why it just goes to show don't let our thoughts be what's dictating let's walk in step with the word but assuming you honestly believe that there's going to be college students raptured I do I believe there's gonna be middle schoolers rapture come on somebody I believe there's gonna be people sitting in nursing homes gonna be raptured come on now they're all tied together yes sir because why these are things in the natural but we've got one objective you see what we're moving into this part of this right here this is why our objective our vision must be single must be Jesus Christ then he becomes the filter of all things every decision comes through Christ every decision is late will Jesus Christ be glorified in my life Paul could say I'm determined he's going to be magnified in my body and every decision to a believer who is where our heartbeats is Christ's going to be magnified if I make this move you can do it you can make it you're free to do it but the decision is will Christ be magnified that's the heartbeat of the believer Christ who is our life when he shall appear hallelu this is what we're looking for this is what we're living for amen god bless you tonight we just want to say we love you in the Lord amen just continue to pay close attention as a church to the emails that are coming out going through those it'll be very helpful for you may God richly bless you questions or concerns you have I've put on there brother Richard and brother Gomez's number they're readily available to be able to help you in any way you can also contact me but I know you'll probably be able to get them first before me so I appreciate all those brothers are doing and working within this and all the legwork that's been going on appreciate each and every one that's been here to try to man these battle stations may God bless each and every one of you a man until we meet again god bless you amen
