[34:06] that god allowed the doctors to tap into
[34:09] that
[34:10] um
[34:11] because of what brother bill had to have
[34:13] done and it was two surgeries he's been
[34:15] through here
[34:16] dealing with the gallbladder it was
[34:18] there on friday and then on saturday
[34:21] was the other surgery so he's doing well
[34:23] he said to thank you
[34:25] for your prayers and he gave me strict
[34:27] instructions as he did on thursday you
[34:29] preached the word brother samuel
[34:32] and um
[34:34] you know
[34:35] so he said i'm getting ready to
[34:37] click in here to stream
[34:39] and so we we certainly love brother bill
[34:41] and just appreciate him and then the
[34:44] testimony for all these years
[34:46] and we just really love him very much
[34:48] and just so thankful and waiting longing
[34:51] for him just to be back here
[34:53] with us and i know if he could have his
[34:55] way he'd be here today
[34:58] but uh lord willing i think tomorrow is
[35:00] when he'll be dismissed from the
[35:01] hospital
[35:03] so
[35:04] let's just keep him in prayer the lord
[35:06] will just continue to give him strength
[35:09] as well
[35:11] also i mentioned on thursday
[35:13] regarding the meetings
[35:15] that we had planned for this coming
[35:17] weekend with brother homer longoria
[35:20] brother homer had sent me a text when i
[35:22] was at the men's meeting last weekend
[35:24] and he
[35:27] just felt and asked if we could just
[35:29] cancel because everything that he's just
[35:31] just kind of the the whole uh toll of
[35:34] everything and everything that he's just
[35:37] had to had to kind of undertake down
[35:39] there and it's been quite a busy time
[35:41] and so we want to just
[35:44] certainly always want to honor that
[35:47] there's been a few times here or there
[35:48] that i've had to cancel out because of
[35:51] things and
[35:52] sometimes i had to one time i had to
[35:54] cancel out just tell a brother said look
[35:55] i'm just worn out i'm just tired i i won
[35:58] one if i came to you just like the way i
[36:00] would be at my own assembly i want to
[36:02] give my very best i said i've got
[36:03] somebody standing in for me this sunday
[36:05] i just want to rest
[36:07] and
[36:08] there's times of refreshment jesus said
[36:10] come aside and rest and we must have
[36:12] those are a very essential event very
[36:14] essential times as well but for brother
[36:17] homer it's not too much i don't want to
[36:18] say a rest he's just there's been a lot
[36:20] that has taken place there
[36:23] with different things funerals and
[36:24] things that's come up
[36:26] so we want to just remember him in
[36:28] prayer and the lord will just make a way
[36:30] for brother homer to be here i just i
[36:32] love brother homer i love i love all of
[36:36] god's gifts and i'm so glad they have
[36:37] such a variety
[36:39] and
[36:40] brother homer just just has a just has a
[36:42] really unique way of
[36:44] and delivery and i just really just
[36:46] always enjoyed the time that we had
[36:48] together so we want to just remember
[36:51] that in prayer so lord willing you know
[36:53] we'll gather here on thursday
[36:56] uh i also want to announce
[36:59] um

[37:27] certainly looking forward to that as
[37:29] well and other announcements they'll be
[37:32] coming out to you
[37:34] so uh and i want to also announce i've
[37:38] got
[37:39] i've asked a few of the brothers here
[37:41] this morning there's four brothers that
[37:44] went down along with me to the men's
[37:46] meeting
[37:47] and
[37:48] i just to me how i feel about the men's
[37:51] meeting
[37:52] if i could just pack every brother up
[37:54] here and take you down with me i'd do it
[37:57] you say brother samuel is that it's that
[37:59] important
[38:00] it's a it's a it's a real um it's a real
[38:04] good meeting and it really gets into
[38:06] some
[38:07] uh just really the word comes and it
[38:10] really challenges our hearts and gets
[38:12] right down
[38:13] very personal and i like that i like for
[38:15] the word to very be i like the word to
[38:17] get personal i like it to challenge our
[38:19] lives
[38:20] because
[38:21] that's that's our way of getting out of
[38:22] here
[38:23] and um we have so much of a great
[38:26] responsibility in this hour and i
[38:28] i i told you at that time when we went
[38:31] into that men's meeting you you have
[38:32] seven services really in just three days
[38:35] and it's really not even saying three
[38:37] days it's actually you have one saturday
[38:39] and then you start on a friday night and
[38:41] you
[38:41] end on a sunday morning but it's filled
[38:44] seven services filled right in there and
[38:47] um
[38:48] but it's my goodness it's it's so
[38:50] edifying i could go on and on about it
[38:54] um but uh i i've asked just for i'm
[38:56] gonna have two of the brothers just to
[38:58] share their testimonies today
[39:01] and
[39:03] just give them just a couple minutes and
[39:05] then we'll go right on into the service
[39:07] would that be okay
[39:09] okay
[39:10] so
[39:13] we're m.i.a right now
[39:15] so
[39:16] okay
[39:19] okay uh don't you come on up he's
[39:21] getting he's getting this microphone
[39:23] right now
[39:25] if it
[39:27] if it goes silent when you're talking
[39:29] that's a sign
[39:37] i'm glad you're saying so i
[39:39] have a couple minutes here it's pretty
[39:41] good because i only wrote down three
[39:42] words
[39:43] i wrote these down uh right as we were
[39:46] leaving
[39:47] the the services actually and uh
[39:49] these three words just kind of came to
[39:51] my heart
[39:53] so uh concerning the men's meeting you
[39:55] know the first first word i wrote down
[39:57] was focused uh these these meetings are
[40:00] very intense they're very
[40:02] very direct and very very focused
[40:05] so
[40:07] that leads right into the next and
[40:09] brother samuel already covered that that
[40:10] means they're challenging the holy
[40:13] spirit can really get down into some
[40:14] areas and do
[40:16] do some pretty uh pretty good excavating
[40:18] of our lives
[40:21] and so
[40:22] but what really sets these meetings uh
[40:24] apart from i believe uh
[40:27] from a lot of the other other things
[40:29] that we we
[40:30] see out in the world and such is
[40:32] is uh the third word was uh applicable
[40:36] and this is where you really have uh
[40:39] you know there's a lot of good help
[40:40] since and different things out there but
[40:42] you know we have um
[40:44] even some that you know come straight
[40:46] from the bible and such but what the
[40:47] difference is is we have the open book
[40:50] you know
[40:51] we had the word we had you know the the
[40:52] message that came this day and really
[40:54] opened up
[40:56] um the word to us so
[40:59] that's what these meetings uh actually
[41:01] really really uh
[41:02] meant to me uh one of the brothers
[41:04] actually
[41:05] covered it is the um the world does a
[41:08] pretty good job at uh
[41:10] defining problems and and identifying
[41:13] problems that you know they have enough
[41:14] surveys and they have enough people
[41:17] who can diagnose different things and
[41:20] the computers are big enough now to
[41:22] really
[41:24] you know crunch all the numbers and
[41:27] the programmers are good enough to write
[41:28] really smart programs and stuff
[41:31] and that was for brother brian back
[41:32] there
[41:34] so they can identify the problem what
[41:35] they can't do is give you the solution
[41:38] and uh
[41:39] you know we know we have the solution
[41:41] you know we have the answer you know
[41:43] christ is the answer so
[41:45] that's what it really meant to me was
[41:47] just really seeing the open book on
[41:50] display you know and and the word just
[41:52] coming forth in such a direct in such a
[41:55] focused and challenging way
[41:57] um and each one of us were kind of at
[42:00] different stages
[42:01] in our lives you know the young i was
[42:03] kind of in the middle and there's you
[42:04] know some of the older ones but you know
[42:06] the lord just had something for
[42:07] everybody
[42:09] and uh and in one of the bible studies
[42:12] the it was
[42:14] in philippians there where it says
[42:16] you know putting things putting you know
[42:18] forgetting the things that are in the
[42:19] past i pressed towards the mark of the
[42:21] prize of the high calling in christ
[42:23] jesus and that's kind of where i was
[42:25] in this stage you know kind of midway
[42:28] through already you know married and had
[42:29] a career
[42:31] sort of so
[42:32] but the holy spirit still gave me tools
[42:36] on how i can press forward i can forget
[42:39] the mistakes in the past and i can press
[42:41] forward so i would just
[42:42] encourage uh men of all ages you know
[42:46] there's gonna be something there for you
[42:47] you know uh the lord will not leave your
[42:50] plate empty
[42:53] so that's that's what i took from it and
[42:56] i would just encourage you know no
[42:57] matter no matter where you're at
[43:00] god will have something for you in these
[43:01] men's meetings
[43:03] it'll be focused it'll be challenged but
[43:05] he'll give you something applicable for
[43:08] your life and whatever stage you're in
[43:10] so god bless
[43:12] [Applause]
[43:19] come on right now
[43:28] all right so i'd like to
[43:30] build on what brother dave said
[43:32] but um
[43:34] really what i want to say and i'll be
[43:36] praying for all the brothers here to to
[43:38] join us next year
[43:40] but um
[43:41] what i'll say is definitely
[43:43] bring your baggage not your physical
[43:45] baggage but your
[43:46] your spiritual baggage because
[43:49] you get to leave it down there you know
[43:51] and
[43:52] really you know that was probably the
[43:54] most powerful part
[43:55] and my biggest struggle going in was
[43:59] work issues and
[44:01] realizing i can't save dishonest
[44:03] co-workers
[44:04] i can't save
[44:07] um you know family members that are
[44:10] living a worldly lifestyle you know only
[44:12] god can do that
[44:14] so
[44:16] and i truly went down there with a
[44:19] a mindset that was
[44:21] scriptural which is
[44:23] ephesians
[44:24] 6 12
[44:26] and i came back
[44:28] with the armor of god for sure and
[44:31] which would be
[44:33] 6 13-20 so
[44:35] my mindset was more and we spoke on it
[44:38] on the way down
[44:39] the condition of the of this hour and of
[44:41] the world we can just
[44:43] stare at how ugly everything is and talk
[44:45] about it and god heard us
[44:48] speaking about it and he healed us of it
[44:52] and we talked about it on the way back
[44:54] that was a testimony
[44:58] but just
[44:59] all the brothers brother samuel you know
[45:01] i told everyone
[45:03] we get to see brother samuel every
[45:05] thursday and sunday
[45:08] and
[45:09] the brother saying on that saturday
[45:11] morning it wasn't the brother samuel i
[45:13] know it was just
[45:14] it was god's
[45:16] it was god's message and
[45:18] although there are seven services
[45:21] there's one message that is three days
[45:23] long and it's one message
[45:25] yes sir
[45:26] um
[45:27] and then jack duff came right after
[45:29] brother samuel
[45:31] and
[45:32] just
[45:34] you know
[45:36] offered something completely different
[45:38] more about being a father
[45:40] told the story of the the
[45:42] papa elephants that left the scene and
[45:46] the baby elephants started to kill the
[45:47] rhinos
[45:49] and then they brought the papa elephants
[45:51] back and all the rhinos stopped dying
[45:54] so
[45:55] it truly uh makes you want to be a
[45:56] better father better worshiper prayer
[46:00] you know
[46:01] son father anything any role in life it
[46:04] improves
[46:06] and then
[46:07] saturday obviously was the longest day
[46:09] but
[46:10] you know brother brian kept saying have
[46:12] you ever heard jason watkins brother
[46:14] jason like no
[46:16] well you're in for a treat i said i feel
[46:17] like
[46:18] i feel like i've already had a treat
[46:22] so
[46:23] i said this is a brother's retreat but
[46:25] really it's a it's a treat it's not a
[46:27] retreat it's a treat and
[46:30] the whole thing was a treat
[46:32] but brother jason summed up
[46:35] the weekend really well and he said
[46:40] this whole weekend has been about you
[46:41] accepting your role
[46:43] and i just that was real powerful
[46:47] it makes you just think well what's my
[46:49] role
[46:51] um and then the most touching part
[46:53] no offense to all the pastors that were
[46:56] there but the most touching part came
[46:58] from brother david kress
[47:00] and he put his hand on my shoulder and
[47:02] said
[47:03] you know one day
[47:05] you know life's going to be like this
[47:08] you're going to go to the elevator god
[47:10] bless you brother
[47:11] you're going to go to the cafeteria god
[47:14] bless you brother
[47:15] you're going to go to the restroom
[47:17] parking lot you can go everywhere
[47:18] and it's going to be god bless you
[47:20] brother
[47:21] amen to that
[47:23] and that's uh that's how i'm gonna end
[47:25] it there
[47:27] [Applause]
[47:36] well let's stand i so appreciate those
[47:38] brothers for sharing we've got
[47:41] a couple other brothers brother brian
[47:44] holdren and brother dave senior
[47:47] and
[47:49] i also want to say
[47:51] this week here i just
[47:53] was
[47:55] brought to my attention they have
[47:57] the archives up archives for the
[48:00] services they're not
[48:01] videoed you can just
[48:03] i know some of you like downloading the
[48:06] mp3s and just listening to them on the
[48:08] job or other
[48:10] ways these you can do that
[48:12] and i i would just i would really really
[48:14] encourage you to do so there's just so
[48:17] much good application
[48:19] within it and i just
[48:22] what brother drake and brother dave had
[48:23] mentioned it's for all ages i i was just
[48:27] just so encouraged i've seen
[48:30] young men who were there
[48:33] some of them i know from the youth youth
[48:35] camps and youth meetings and things like
[48:37] that and you know 17 years old and 18
[48:40] years old i was so glad to see them
[48:42] there because there's things sometimes
[48:43] you can look
[48:44] and sometimes we look and say when we
[48:46] get to this spot we need to hear this
[48:48] there's a lot of things that's so good
[48:49] that i always think how brother branham
[48:51] said it like this but brahman says let
[48:53] my mistakes be stepping stones of god's
[48:55] grace for you
[48:57] and i always look at that to me that's a
[48:59] real character to be able to put
[49:01] yourself out there and go and go through
[49:03] that and we truly brother brahm told us
[49:05] he said joshua benefited he learned from
[49:09] moses so not only did he take the
[49:11] message in but he also learned don't
[49:14] send a bunch of people over so he didn't
[49:16] send 12 people to go to go to jericho he
[49:19] sent two
[49:20] you knew you don't you don't need it you
[49:22] don't need a whole company he's seen
[49:24] that and brother tells us that so
[49:26] there's a lot there's things that we
[49:27] thank god just to be able to be
[49:29] observant within that i just really
[49:31] thank brother barry for having that
[49:33] vision
[49:34] and one of the things i shared this with
[49:36] you on thursday
[49:38] we look at things in the word of god and
[49:40] i and i this is one of the things that i
[49:43] was is bringing even with the brethren
[49:45] there
[49:46] and i said it on thursday here satan is
[49:48] subtle but he's very intentional
[49:51] and we need the discernment of the holy
[49:54] spirit
[49:55] over and over and over in our lives
[49:59] i witnessed it right there in the life
[50:01] of the prophet through the message that
[50:03] there were things that unless god
[50:05] uncovered
[50:07] it took god to uncover it but quickly
[50:09] when god uncovered it the prophet sided
[50:12] with god who uncovered him
[50:14] and and that's why i just told the
[50:16] brother and i said we
[50:18] we cannot afford in this time in this
[50:20] hour just to say well
[50:22] something we just put it on autopilot
[50:24] it's not autopilot
[50:26] that's not how the gospel works the
[50:28] gospel works to bring a change in a real
[50:31] direction in our life but then as the
[50:33] word is coming forth we prostrate
[50:35] ourselves before living god and say god
[50:37] change me
[50:39] mold me shape me and that's why i just
[50:41] put that word we must be if there's
[50:44] maybe even to bring this to the assembly
[50:45] here to put it before our lives there's
[50:47] one thing we need to be is very
[50:49] intentional
[50:51] very intentional with what we're doing
[50:54] and so we just we we thank god for this
[50:58] and
[51:01] i want to just just approach some things
[51:03] here this morning and we'll just see how
[51:05] the lord will just
[51:07] just take us
[51:08] and
[51:09] so if we could just turn in our bibles
[51:11] to psalm 65 and verse 4
[51:17] i was standing there in the back when i
[51:19] walked in and then i got there to the
[51:21] service i had to go back down i was
[51:22] waiting on brother paul to bring him up
[51:24] to the tabernacle there the chapel and
[51:26] you walk in and if you've never heard
[51:28] just
[51:29] i don't know what was it 200 250 300
[51:32] brothers if you never see hear all men
[51:34] singing
[51:37] my goodness i mean it was just it was
[51:39] just something just to see
[51:41] just the brethren just just worshiping
[51:43] and
[51:44] and
[51:45] then you know as as time went on and
[51:48] things like that sunday morning well
[51:50] i had to get a few videos sunday morning
[51:52] because brother jack was leading songs
[51:55] and we had a time man we had a time
[51:58] so i just love to worship the lord don't
[52:00] you
[52:01] amen i believe there should be liberty
[52:04] in the house of god
[52:05] amen so psalm 65
[52:07] verse 4
[52:09] could we just bow our hearts in prayer
[52:11] heavenly father
[52:13] thank you for your mercy this morning
[52:15] thank you for this opportunity that we
[52:17] have to be able to gather here the lord

[52:22] moments that you have given to us would

[52:46] done we pray father we ask it in the
[52:49] name of jesus christ amen
[52:52] amen psalms
[52:54] 65
[52:56] and verse 4.
[52:57] if we can just begin there
[53:00] and that's only verse i'm going to read
[53:02] here this morning
[53:03] blessed is the man
[53:05] whom thou
[53:06] chooseth
[53:07] and calls us
[53:09] to approach unto thee
[53:11] that he may dwell in thy courts
[53:15] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[53:19] of thy house even
[53:22] of thy holy
[53:23] temple
[53:25] amen may god bless the word and reading
[53:27] as you're being seated
[53:38] i want to start here with a thought
[53:41] we've we've been looking at
[53:44] uh
[53:45] over the past a few services here
[53:49] and then as brother nathan came right
[53:50] along
[53:52] and my goodness i mean you
[53:54] it's just awesome how god puts things
[53:55] together isn't it
[53:57] and um you know god is so mindful of our
[54:00] needs and i want to just look at this
[54:04] the thought here this morning and just
[54:06] begin to deal with this a little bit
[54:08] on the testimony of our lives and i want
[54:11] to look at one word
[54:13] consecration
[54:15] when brother branham means he takes this
[54:17] in a hidden life with christ
[54:20] he says just like god
[54:22] living in those three courts
[54:26] he surely lives in the court of the
[54:28] congregation
[54:30] he lived he also lives here at the holy
[54:33] place
[54:34] but his abiding place
[54:36] he says this was just attributes of his
[54:38] presence
[54:40] from the holiest of holies has everybody
[54:42] got that image in your mind that that
[54:44] picture
[54:45] if you need me to put it back up i can
[54:47] do that as well
[54:49] anybody need me to put it back up
[54:51] it's felt like a classroom okay i'll put
[54:52] it back up it's okay
[54:56] i get accused of being thorough no no
[54:59] no need to stop now
[55:05] so
[55:06] this is what we're this is what we're
[55:08] dealing with and i want to just look at
[55:10] this here just a moment
[55:15] this is what we're as we're looking at
[55:17] this tabernacle remember this is the
[55:18] place where god said
[55:21] let them
[55:22] build me a sanctuary
[55:25] that i may dwell among them god's desire
[55:28] remember
[55:29] god dwelt among them
[55:32] where god created
[55:34] man brought forth a woman they lived
[55:38] in that place of god's presence
[55:41] there in the garden of eden the whole
[55:44] earth
[55:45] wasn't the garden of eden the garden of
[55:47] eden was a specific
[55:49] place
[55:51] chosen by god as a matter of fact the
[55:53] very word hebrew or the very word garden
[55:56] in the hebrew means a bride
[55:59] an enclosed one
[56:01] so here the garden of god it was a place
[56:04] reserved by god for him
[56:07] and his family to dwell
[56:10] and to see that how we know sin entered
[56:13] in and then there was an exiling from
[56:16] his presence but god made a promise
[56:20] that he said i will make a way back
[56:24] and the way that would be made is that
[56:27] god would become one of us he said i
[56:30] will give to the woman a seed because
[56:33] the woman has no seed but god said i
[56:35] will give her a seed because within that
[56:38] seed sets the nature sets the life god
[56:42] himself would create a blood cell
[56:45] and step into it
[56:48] that the blood itself would pay the
[56:50] price
[56:51] and then the life contained in that
[56:53] blood cell now could come back upon the
[56:56] worshiper
[56:57] already having a seed of god and raised
[57:00] that seed to life because that seed is
[57:04] actually god's dwelling place
[57:07] and god will not reach down and take it
[57:09] but he says let them
[57:11] make me a sanctuary
[57:13] you see serving god is not under do's
[57:15] and don'ts it's under a surrendered life
[57:18] so it all is a beginning with a yielding
[57:21] life so this when god would give many
[57:23] many many types
[57:25] through the scripture the tabernacle of
[57:27] the wilderness three quarts as we look
[57:30] at it
[57:31] you and i live in a three-room house
[57:34] body
[57:35] spirit
[57:36] soul
[57:38] the innermost part this
[57:40] this part that was in that is that is in
[57:43] here
[57:44] this is that place
[57:46] some of you i know you think i love
[57:48] doing this but it is pretty neat
[57:50] but it helps me get get visually the
[57:52] point across here
[57:54] that's the abiding place
[57:57] what i just read to you brother brahm
[57:59] says he lived
[58:01] throughout all the other courts so what
[58:03] does that mean
[58:04] is that
[58:05] god's presence this is where god
[58:08] abided
[58:10] his presence
[58:12] came down
[58:13] where he gave the testimony which the
[58:17] testimony is his word being placed in
[58:21] the ark which the ark is a type of the
[58:25] human heart
[58:27] this was god's desire now when that is
[58:30] there
[58:31] then the rest of these courts that are
[58:34] here our spirit out here our body out
[58:38] here god dwelling on the inside it now
[58:41] reflects itself out here so these hands
[58:45] do god things
[58:48] the spirit thinks god's thoughts
[58:50] see he lives in the other courts but he
[58:53] abides
[58:55] amen
[58:56] this is what this is why the baptism of
[58:59] the holy ghost just out here
[59:03] in in the uh uh on the flesh or on the
[59:06] spirit
[59:07] that's where brother branham makes a
[59:08] statement a person could have the
[59:10] baptism of the holy ghost every hour of
[59:13] their life and still be lost and go to
[59:15] hell why because it's not in here in the
[59:19] abiding because when it abides it
[59:22] changes you
[59:25] you're no longer the same person amen
[59:30] and then it affects it it shows itself
[59:34] throughout the rest of the courts now
[59:36] well i want to what i'm going to go to
[59:38] here lord willing here this morning just
[59:40] how the lord will take us
[59:42] um i want to just deal with these are
[59:45] the things and i'll go and let you know
[59:46] so you have it visually i want to i want
[59:48] to dwell with deal with this part of
[59:51] where we are
[59:52] and come to back in here but i want to
[59:55] deal with the part of coming to this
[59:58] place and the real coming to this place
[1:00:00] when we look at it in terms of the
[1:00:02] tabernacle in the wilderness we look at
[1:00:04] it as though it's us making steps
[1:00:07] forward but if you can really capture it
[1:00:10] it's not so much us progressing forward
[1:00:13] it's us yielding and allowing the holy
[1:00:15] spirit to move deeper
[1:00:20] because if we put it it's us going
[1:00:22] forward it's our works but if we can
[1:00:24] recognize it's all about yielding
[1:00:28] and then it's the holy spirit going
[1:00:30] deeper
[1:00:34] so now you switch that off benjamin
[1:00:35] thank you
[1:00:37] it'll keep you on your toes this morning
[1:00:39] if i have to refer back to something huh
[1:00:42] so just like god living in those those
[1:00:45] three courts
[1:00:46] brother bram says he surely lives in the
[1:00:48] court of the congregation
[1:00:50] he also lives here at the holy place
[1:00:54] but his abiding place
[1:00:56] and he says these were just attributes
[1:00:59] of his presence from the holiest of
[1:01:00] holies i can't deal with this here this
[1:01:03] morning but even in that place of our
[1:01:05] life
[1:01:06] there are many of those places there
[1:01:08] than our life once that abiding presence
[1:01:10] of god
[1:01:11] you and i
[1:01:12] now in our life all things have become
[1:01:15] new yet you might have the same old job
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:20] got to make out the same old insurance
[1:01:21] papers
[1:01:23] are you with me drive the same old car
[1:01:26] whatever you know age your car is lease
[1:01:28] or whatever you understand
[1:01:29] those things are not changed what
[1:01:31] changes god has got the control on the
[1:01:35] inside
[1:01:37] god doesn't take away even a person's
[1:01:40] temperament
[1:01:41] that's right that's good right yes sir
[1:01:44] god doesn't say you know what i don't
[1:01:45] like melancholy people
[1:01:47] brother brahm tells us he was melancholy
[1:01:50] is that right you can read it brother
[1:01:51] brown when he was up he was up and he
[1:01:52] was down he's down right
[1:01:55] melanchola is gonna be right on the
[1:01:57] marker got to be nailing nailing the
[1:01:58] eyes of the squirrels out of the way god
[1:02:00] what did brother them say billy bram sat
[1:02:01] down and said oh why am i this way
[1:02:06] god said i made you this way for a
[1:02:08] purpose
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:10] but you take the temperament that
[1:02:12] brother branham had without the
[1:02:14] influence of the holy ghost from the
[1:02:16] soul
[1:02:16] it was nothing
[1:02:18] but yielding in the hands of god now in
[1:02:21] god's hands becomes like the little
[1:02:23] lad's lunch
[1:02:24] it multiplies
[1:02:26] it ministers to others around him
[1:02:30] we bring it down ministers to our family
[1:02:32] ministers to one another what is it it's
[1:02:34] his abiding presence now that ministers
[1:02:36] throughout our life
[1:02:38] and has an effect
[1:02:40] over our life
[1:02:42] so david i want you to think of this
[1:02:44] here david knew
[1:02:47] david knew there was a place
[1:02:50] to where
[1:02:51] in god to where he could experience the
[1:02:54] abiding reality his soul was craving for
[1:02:58] and i want you to catch this the abiding
[1:03:00] reality david could say take not thy
[1:03:02] holy spirit from me because all the way
[1:03:05] until the lord jesus walks up out of the
[1:03:08] river jordan the holy spirit had come
[1:03:10] would leave come leave come leave but
[1:03:14] now the holy spirit descends
[1:03:17] upon the lamb that's why brother graham
[1:03:19] said see predestination he was already a
[1:03:22] lamb when he came there
[1:03:26] the word does not make us a lamb the
[1:03:28] word brings lambs to full reality
[1:03:33] because others won't do nothing to do
[1:03:35] with it others will not surrender to the
[1:03:38] call of the word what did jesus say my
[1:03:42] sheep
[1:03:43] know
[1:03:44] my voice
[1:03:48] this is before the new birth and then
[1:03:51] after the new birth we become locked
[1:03:54] into his
[1:03:56] voice so brother brown when he when he
[1:03:59] would lay very clearly all the way with
[1:04:01] the doctrine of predestination and
[1:04:02] elections
[1:04:04] and all of those things this is why
[1:04:05] brother graham can make such a clear
[1:04:06] statement in the church age book and say
[1:04:09] you were not
[1:04:10] you are not you didn't become sheep you
[1:04:13] always were sheep you didn't become a
[1:04:15] son of god you always were a son of god
[1:04:19] and he says because you were a seed of
[1:04:21] god that's what allowed you to be born
[1:04:25] again because to be born again is to be
[1:04:28] born as peter writes of the
[1:04:31] incorruptible word of god to where your
[1:04:35] life now matches the word of god
[1:04:40] this is why brother branham when he
[1:04:42] takes it
[1:04:43] i don't know how anybody could ever
[1:04:44] accuse brother branham of not preaching
[1:04:47] on the holy ghost
[1:04:49] that blows me away this statement's
[1:04:50] always blowing me away in satan's eating
[1:04:52] 1965. brother bram says i hear around
[1:04:54] here people been saying why aren't
[1:04:56] brother brandon preaching on the holy
[1:04:57] ghost in jeffersonville
[1:04:59] i don't know i can't listen to a message
[1:05:01] where i don't hear and there's not a
[1:05:03] message here i don't care what message i
[1:05:05] preach it still deals with do you have
[1:05:07] the overcoming life on the inside as
[1:05:10] something that is there it's a resolve
[1:05:12] in order to bring forth
[1:05:14] brother branham is like being accused he
[1:05:16] said so i'm going to address that right
[1:05:18] here he said the holy ghost
[1:05:20] and he goes into and he says it's not
[1:05:22] the speaking in tongues and all these
[1:05:25] other things that's out there he says
[1:05:27] let me say this to you he said don't
[1:05:29] watch the holy ghost so much in
[1:05:32] demonstrations
[1:05:34] but you watch it in action
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:40] because demonstrations this one might
[1:05:42] speak in tongues this one might have you
[1:05:44] know a gift of faith and this one might
[1:05:46] hear and this one right here remember
[1:05:48] gifts and callings are without
[1:05:52] repentance repentance doesn't bring them
[1:05:56] they're laying there
[1:05:57] hallelujah are you with me this is why
[1:05:59] elvis presley the beatles and on and on
[1:06:01] and everybody else who sold out their
[1:06:03] gifts
[1:06:04] preachers and everybody everybody will
[1:06:06] have to give an account because they are
[1:06:08] without repentance
[1:06:12] so they had to yield their talents to
[1:06:14] somebody and come under the influence of
[1:06:16] one i just want to be found yielding
[1:06:18] mine to the lord
[1:06:20] that's uh lord whatever you have for me
[1:06:22] i just want to be found yielding it
[1:06:24] there this is why brother brown could
[1:06:26] say when he makes that in that statement
[1:06:28] he says not so much in demonstration but
[1:06:30] in action our everyday life
[1:06:37] see god's
[1:06:39] david would have that desire because
[1:06:41] david knew there was a place
[1:06:45] and his soul was craving for that
[1:06:48] and that place of rest
[1:06:51] is in man
[1:06:54] it's in christ
[1:06:55] god's place of rest
[1:06:58] is inside of man
[1:07:02] let me just take you not this flesh
[1:07:05] not my spirit
[1:07:07] but the real gift of god
[1:07:09] is that soul
[1:07:12] you hear me you know i'm quoting these
[1:07:15] that real gift because that on the
[1:07:17] inside that's laid their dormant
[1:07:20] all these years like genesis 1
[1:07:22] laid there but placed by god when the
[1:07:25] holy spirit begins to move upon that
[1:07:27] what's it doing it's to bring that to
[1:07:29] life dismiss the influences of darkness
[1:07:33] over our life you see first the word has
[1:07:37] to dismiss
[1:07:38] all things contrary
[1:07:41] that are hindering
[1:07:42] light from penetrating
[1:07:45] so it's god who breaks the darkness when
[1:07:48] he says let there be light he's speaking
[1:07:51] to the darkness give away
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:54] what light was it that shone first not
[1:07:57] the sun
[1:07:58] the shekinah light of almighty god
[1:08:01] because it is by his light that
[1:08:03] everything else is set in order
[1:08:08] so god's place of rest is in man
[1:08:11] it and this is why coming back to the
[1:08:14] original place where in his spirit image
[1:08:18] is reflected in us and through us i want
[1:08:20] to just read a few places that david
[1:08:23] in the psalms would write of this desire
[1:08:26] david would say in psalms 84 1
[1:08:29] how amiable meaning how lovely
[1:08:32] are thy dwelling are thy tabernacles o
[1:08:35] lord of hosts my soul
[1:08:37] longeth yea even fainteth for the courts
[1:08:41] of the lord
[1:08:42] my heart and my flesh crieth out for the
[1:08:46] living god
[1:08:47] ye the sparrow hath found a house and
[1:08:49] the swallow a nest for herself where she
[1:08:52] may lay her young even thine altars o
[1:08:55] lord of hosts my king and my god
[1:08:58] blessed are they that dwell in thy house
[1:09:01] they will still be praising
[1:09:04] thee 10 of the same chapter for a day
[1:09:09] in thy courts is better than a thousand
[1:09:14] i would rather be a door keeper in the
[1:09:17] house of my god than to dwell
[1:09:20] in the tents of wickedness
[1:09:23] [Applause]
[1:09:27] oh glory
[1:09:31] you see israel when they would come
[1:09:34] into the land in that picture that i
[1:09:35] showed you moments ago
[1:09:38] god laid all this vision the vision of
[1:09:40] the word god's desire
[1:09:43] you see every time when god reveals his
[1:09:45] word it's god conveying his desire
[1:09:49] every time these are things sometimes
[1:09:51] that you and i can take into our lives
[1:09:53] and say my i just don't seem like i
[1:09:55] understand that it's really not about
[1:09:58] that we understand it here i can piece
[1:09:59] it together there but the word comes and
[1:10:01] it challenges us and sometimes we look
[1:10:04] at it and say
[1:10:05] i i don't see it all but what is why is
[1:10:07] god doing that he's asking and
[1:10:09] delivering something to you and i that
[1:10:11] we might pray about it even when we look
[1:10:14] in our lives and say i don't see that in
[1:10:15] my life god's not bringing it to condemn
[1:10:19] he's bringing it so that you and i can
[1:10:21] see these are the rights and privileges
[1:10:24] that you have as sons and daughters of
[1:10:26] god now seek you first
[1:10:30] yes sir see god he god's remember he
[1:10:34] knew he knew the work that needed to be
[1:10:36] done when he gathered all the disciples
[1:10:37] and said look upon the the fields
[1:10:39] they're white they're ready for harvest
[1:10:41] and he said pray ye the lord of harvest
[1:10:43] to send laborers into the venue he knew
[1:10:45] what needed to be done but he's made man
[1:10:47] his co-worker his partner let me tell
[1:10:50] you something this is why brother ram
[1:10:52] could bring it down in souls in prison
[1:10:54] now and speak of the perfection that has
[1:10:56] come to the church of the living god
[1:10:58] through the opening of the seventh seal
[1:11:00] that opening of the seventh seal is
[1:11:03] christ coming and taking his rightful
[1:11:06] place in the heart of his bride he is
[1:11:10] the hidden man in the heart of the
[1:11:12] believer
[1:11:14] that's what the seventh seal does simply
[1:11:16] put as brother rem said it brings him
[1:11:18] back down to earth
[1:11:20] what does that mean brings him back down
[1:11:21] to earth he was always here he's got
[1:11:24] vessels that are yielded and available
[1:11:27] that he can express himself i'm alive
[1:11:30] i'm a well my power is still the same i
[1:11:32] have the same glory i'm not diminished
[1:11:35] what's one iota whatsoever and i'm here
[1:11:38] to declare that i'm still the same and
[1:11:40] i'm doing it through my bride
[1:11:44] hallelujah so here as it brings it down
[1:11:46] and brother brown would take those whole
[1:11:48] groupings of statements and souls and
[1:11:51] prisons and say now that we have been
[1:11:53] brought back into that place united with
[1:11:56] the mind of christ the holy spirit
[1:11:58] operating our life because we don't
[1:12:00] think this way
[1:12:01] are you hearing me we don't think this
[1:12:03] way
[1:12:04] even when we read the bible we can look
[1:12:07] at it and say oh that's precious but the
[1:12:09] thoughts of god are not things that we
[1:12:11] read the thoughts of god are spiritually
[1:12:14] revealed
[1:12:18] this was a realm brother brown we'll
[1:12:20] call it a realm that we are privileged
[1:12:22] by the holy ghost to tap into because
[1:12:24] let me tell you something we can all
[1:12:26] fellowship on this point we have a
[1:12:28] choice daily in our life you say brother
[1:12:30] samuel are you talking to born again i'm
[1:12:31] talking to everybody here i don't preach
[1:12:33] to one group of people i preach to
[1:12:36] everybody no matter where you're at we
[1:12:38] have a challenge daily in our lives
[1:12:41] whether we're going to live by our own
[1:12:42] human mind or the mind of christ
[1:12:46] if you don't have the mind of christ
[1:12:47] then you don't have that choice but you
[1:12:49] can receive the mind of christ i'm
[1:12:52] talking about the holy ghost
[1:12:54] and now now when you receive the mind of
[1:12:57] christ it's to yield to his mind
[1:13:02] you see what do you mean well instead of
[1:13:03] reaching for a gun in the pasture of a
[1:13:05] bull
[1:13:06] now you're operating by the mind of
[1:13:08] christ
[1:13:09] remember brother branham here he is what
[1:13:10] is it what was i speaking of it's just
[1:13:12] things are natural right i mean they're
[1:13:14] saying your natural responses
[1:13:16] there's things nobody had to tell us
[1:13:18] about how some of the natural dna some
[1:13:21] of the natural flow that came off of our
[1:13:22] family tree
[1:13:24] come on now god's cleaned out a lot of
[1:13:26] all those things have been changed
[1:13:28] within our nature but there's certain
[1:13:29] things still about us that didn't get
[1:13:32] stripped out
[1:13:34] god just said you know what i'm gonna
[1:13:36] come down in the midst of your
[1:13:38] temperament
[1:13:41] of your mind
[1:13:43] and i am going to create an eden in the
[1:13:47] midst of your life
[1:13:51] you want to know how adam led the animal
[1:13:53] life
[1:13:54] hallelujah come on now animal life
[1:13:57] take a look this boy right here animal
[1:14:00] life brother bam said one without the
[1:14:02] holy ghost is lower than a dog
[1:14:06] he'll make decisions do things that's
[1:14:08] based simply upon self but when the holy
[1:14:10] ghost comes on the inside god displays
[1:14:13] that once again a son of god is now
[1:14:16] reigning on earth and is bringing animal
[1:14:19] life in subjection to zoe life
[1:14:24] are you with me oh glory be to god
[1:14:27] this is the manifestation of the sons
[1:14:29] and daughters of god it brings into
[1:14:31] subjection our own thoughts about things
[1:14:34] listen god's not a cookie cutter
[1:14:38] you know god's not saying well you know
[1:14:39] what i want everybody to think like
[1:14:40] brother richard or brother samuel
[1:14:42] brother gomez or brother carl thank god
[1:14:44] thank god you all don't think like me
[1:14:47] i'll go and say for brother richard
[1:14:48] thank god we all don't think like
[1:14:49] brother richard
[1:14:51] sister marie is ready to shout
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:14:59] jesus help us
[1:15:02] but see god ain't interested in changing
[1:15:05] he don't want to change of how a
[1:15:07] personality remember brother graham said
[1:15:09] in things that ought to be he said if
[1:15:11] you tried to judge james by peter you'd
[1:15:13] be putting them out
[1:15:14] oh because peter does this and james
[1:15:16] brother bran brings that out and things
[1:15:17] that are to be it's not that god sets
[1:15:20] down in the middle of our temperament
[1:15:25] let me just qualify this a little bit
[1:15:27] too
[1:15:28] when this does not give this is not any
[1:15:30] little bit of wiggle room for an excuse
[1:15:32] to say well you know my daddy was like
[1:15:34] this and my mama was like this well you
[1:15:36] know if i hadn't been raised this way
[1:15:39] if you have been born again of the
[1:15:41] spirit of god
[1:15:43] you've got the answer
[1:15:46] to the devil's question
[1:15:49] i'm pointing to the victory that lays in
[1:15:51] you that victory that's in christ you
[1:15:53] have it don't let the devil sell you
[1:15:55] short you're more than an overcomer your
[1:15:57] mind and a match for the devil
[1:16:00] with the biting presence of almighty god
[1:16:03] dwelling in your life greater is he
[1:16:05] that's in you
[1:16:07] than he that's in the world
[1:16:10] see this is where when israel
[1:16:13] that pillar of fire would come down
[1:16:15] and here it would rest and abide god's
[1:16:18] presence
[1:16:19] you're coming into that innermost place
[1:16:23] israel could see it
[1:16:26] israel witnessed it even when it
[1:16:28] happened in the days
[1:16:30] of solomon
[1:16:32] when solomon's
[1:16:33] the temple remember solomon
[1:16:35] built the temple and now became instead
[1:16:38] of walking around and moving in tents it
[1:16:40] became
[1:16:42] a building comprised of stones which
[1:16:44] testifies of our life both of them do
[1:16:48] but even there's a kind of glory i don't
[1:16:50] want to lose you on that but i want to
[1:16:51] just focus on this part on the coming of
[1:16:53] the life of almighty god in behind the
[1:16:57] veil the rest of the world
[1:17:00] couldn't see it
[1:17:02] the rest of the world you and i have
[1:17:04] that the previous picture that i many
[1:17:06] times we see at the christian bookstore
[1:17:08] you see online and here you see the rest
[1:17:10] of the world could not see that
[1:17:16] but israel
[1:17:18] knew by faith he was back there
[1:17:22] he said how did he know because number
[1:17:24] one the pattern that god gave by his
[1:17:28] word he had a prophet on earth that
[1:17:31] could catch his thoughts
[1:17:33] that operated beyond natural senses and
[1:17:36] was caught up into a spiritual realm
[1:17:40] is that right moses was caught up in the
[1:17:42] cloud that's why it's no shock to us god
[1:17:44] still deals with clouds in sabino canyon
[1:17:47] the prophet was caught up in the cloud
[1:17:51] we understand this we're scriptural is
[1:17:53] that right
[1:17:54] elijah saw the coming rain the rain that
[1:17:56] was promised upon a dry and barren land
[1:17:59] what was it a cloud the size of a man's
[1:18:02] hand was that a type of the hand of the
[1:18:05] lord the power of god coming as
[1:18:08] nourishment to the church of the living
[1:18:10] god
[1:18:12] amen it was received in the cloud taken
[1:18:15] away they saw him and he said this same
[1:18:16] jesus will come in like manner so
[1:18:19] there's the whole process unfolding
[1:18:22] so israel knew like brother brown would
[1:18:24] say like this israel knew
[1:18:27] that he was back there
[1:18:29] everybody else they could question it
[1:18:31] they what do you mean god's back there
[1:18:34] who is this god
[1:18:35] but see israel
[1:18:37] knew it brother brown would put this out
[1:18:38] over and over they knew it
[1:18:41] by faith
[1:18:43] regardless of what all the unbelievers
[1:18:45] could say the unbelievers could say you
[1:18:48] know what do you mean god in your midst
[1:18:51] it didn't matter
[1:18:52] they knew
[1:18:56] all the skeptics could say whatever they
[1:18:58] wanted to say brother brahman says
[1:18:59] regardless of what anybody said they
[1:19:02] knew he was back there
[1:19:05] can we bring it on home regardless of
[1:19:07] what the devil tries to say regardless
[1:19:10] of what might come your way you know
[1:19:12] something's happened to you you know
[1:19:14] there's a god back there behind skin in
[1:19:17] your life
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] you know there's a god who's seated on
[1:19:22] the throne you know there's a greater
[1:19:24] there's one inside of you you're not the
[1:19:26] same person you used to be your desires
[1:19:30] have been changed and your life has
[1:19:33] become filled with the life of almighty
[1:19:36] god
[1:19:38] that's a sovereign work by almighty god
[1:19:40] you can't study yourself into it you
[1:19:42] can't read yourself into it you can't
[1:19:44] work yourself into it you must yield
[1:19:47] yourself
[1:19:52] oh that's why brother brown calls that
[1:19:55] that that coming in there and mighty god
[1:19:58] he calls that coming of the pillar fire
[1:20:00] in there on that mercy seat because
[1:20:02] where is the mercy seat it's in the
[1:20:04] heart of the believer
[1:20:07] you say the heart of the believer i
[1:20:08] thought the mercy seat that he ascended
[1:20:10] on high and sent gifts back to men but
[1:20:13] remember what was in heaven must be
[1:20:16] reflected on earth my my mind
[1:20:18] because you see now he is seated in
[1:20:21] power and glory and honor and what does
[1:20:24] he do he sends back the holy ghost and
[1:20:27] now he takes his rightful abode and
[1:20:30] abiding place in the mercy seat of our
[1:20:33] heart and what does it do just as he
[1:20:36] overcame and is the overcomer it shines
[1:20:40] towards an overcoming life through you
[1:20:42] and i
[1:20:44] that's the great secret
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:47] oh that's the great secret that half
[1:20:49] hour this is the great secret the
[1:20:51] descending down of his presence
[1:20:55] you see this is that place
[1:20:58] that man fell from you see this is what
[1:21:01] all
[1:21:02] of the horse riders in the seals
[1:21:05] has been about those are all through the
[1:21:06] ages what was that all about to take
[1:21:08] away
[1:21:09] the power of the real relationship
[1:21:12] between god and man
[1:21:15] and substitute it and give them just put
[1:21:16] your name right here and you can be part
[1:21:18] of a church
[1:21:20] just say you believe in jesus you can
[1:21:22] just be a part it's the substitute
[1:21:25] the personal
[1:21:27] christ
[1:21:28] in the spirit
[1:21:30] of the believer
[1:21:32] satan don't care how religious somebody
[1:21:33] is right
[1:21:36] it don't matter
[1:21:38] what it is he wants to withhold
[1:21:40] from that life because he knows when
[1:21:42] that life a person moves in there
[1:21:45] point of no return
[1:21:48] call me gone
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:52] well glory to god
[1:21:55] you see this is the place that man
[1:21:57] that man fell from
[1:21:59] perfect fellowship
[1:22:01] a oneness with god
[1:22:04] where the very image of god
[1:22:07] was now
[1:22:09] it was on display
[1:22:11] in man's life remember how brother brown
[1:22:12] would put it there in the message
[1:22:14] oneness
[1:22:15] of how that here they had god's holy
[1:22:19] image dwelling in them they were in
[1:22:21] god's
[1:22:23] image
[1:22:24] and they were united with his presence
[1:22:27] brother brown would say it like this i
[1:22:28] don't have that quote up there it's in
[1:22:29] front of me but let's just listen to
[1:22:32] the realm
[1:22:33] and the atmosphere the privilege of
[1:22:36] where
[1:22:37] that they had the privilege to walk and
[1:22:39] god has brought us back to that same
[1:22:42] place that everybody can have that same
[1:22:44] privilege that we can walk in this place
[1:22:46] he says where he guided them
[1:22:49] oh i can't think if there's anything
[1:22:50] greater that we have need of as lord
[1:22:52] guide me
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:54] guide me guide me lord
[1:22:56] so brother simon oh yeah i need in the
[1:22:59] truth brother branham preaches the
[1:23:00] message of guide and brother branham
[1:23:02] brings it down in the add a ladder part
[1:23:03] of that he says i'm not a fisherman i'm
[1:23:05] not a hunter i'm not he says as a matter
[1:23:07] of fact every trophy i've got it's
[1:23:09] because he's guided me to them
[1:23:12] whoo that's humility because brother
[1:23:13] brown knew the heels brother brown knew
[1:23:15] how to get around brother brown was a
[1:23:17] good shot
[1:23:18] but how he put it back around is it's
[1:23:21] god who has guided him to these things
[1:23:27] who
[1:23:28] he fed them god provided for them he
[1:23:31] loved them he communed with them
[1:23:32] constantly all
[1:23:35] the time
[1:23:36] this was where
[1:23:38] they were before the fall this was where
[1:23:41] the abiding presence of god this is
[1:23:43] where god's desire is to come back into
[1:23:45] that place of where his holy image his
[1:23:47] life is now reflected through our lives
[1:23:50] let's come back to the scripture here
[1:23:52] for a few moments in psalm 65 verse 4
[1:23:54] and let's look at this here just a
[1:23:56] little bit
[1:23:57] in verse 4 blessed
[1:24:00] is the man whom thou chooses
[1:24:03] you didn't know it but you were already
[1:24:04] blessed
[1:24:07] and when he came to mary
[1:24:09] he never said cursed art thou blessed
[1:24:12] our tower among women
[1:24:14] you want to know why your life's been a
[1:24:15] little different all your life
[1:24:18] blessed are you among women
[1:24:24] blessed is the man whom thou
[1:24:26] chooses
[1:24:28] and calls it so now the choosing of god
[1:24:31] now notice and causes
[1:24:33] to approach
[1:24:35] unto thee
[1:24:37] for what purpose that he might dwell
[1:24:41] in thy
[1:24:42] courts now in the courts of the lord is
[1:24:45] dwelling in christ
[1:24:48] dwelling in the word
[1:24:51] remember at that day you shall know
[1:24:54] that i am in the father the father in me
[1:24:57] i in you and you are in
[1:25:00] me
[1:25:01] so remember god's place of rest is here
[1:25:04] within man
[1:25:06] so the courts of the lord dwelling in
[1:25:09] his presence dwelling in his word
[1:25:12] dwelling in his
[1:25:14] life
[1:25:16] i'm just going to make i just have to
[1:25:18] you know i had to be myself
[1:25:20] when paul could stand there on mars hill
[1:25:23] and he saw this inscription to an
[1:25:24] unknown unknown god is what it said
[1:25:28] paul said i want to tell you about this
[1:25:30] fellow
[1:25:33] so paul took his took his text maybe
[1:25:36] he would take his text from luke 24 and
[1:25:38] say but i'm going to take the whole
[1:25:39] bible this morning for my text
[1:25:45] and paul began to minister the word and
[1:25:47] what did he let him know what you've
[1:25:49] been bumping into
[1:25:52] throughout your life
[1:25:54] this is the living god of whom we live
[1:25:58] breathe he's right here
[1:26:00] see god it's like this there's signals
[1:26:02] coming through here if i take this belt
[1:26:05] back this morning and i turn this thing
[1:26:07] off and i get a power switch if i turn
[1:26:09] it off it doesn't matter how loud i
[1:26:11] scream there's no signal going to be
[1:26:13] sent out of here but when i turn this on
[1:26:16] there's a signal there's a channel on
[1:26:18] here it's tapped into a channel over
[1:26:21] there that's how we can have three of
[1:26:23] these up here at the same time and they
[1:26:25] don't give you the
[1:26:27] they don't give you that you know why
[1:26:29] because they each have their own
[1:26:31] selective channel and frequency and paul
[1:26:35] was chosen by god he was tuned in to the
[1:26:39] frequency of jesus christ in that hour
[1:26:43] and he was sent forth as a united vessel
[1:26:47] to make the invisible god visible right
[1:26:50] there in the midst of those people
[1:26:55] that's what real leadership is real
[1:26:58] leadership comes from a living god
[1:27:00] coming down and taking on skin
[1:27:04] amen
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:09] so the same god the one as brother
[1:27:11] brandon would put that there we
[1:27:12] referenced that in uh warning before
[1:27:15] judgment brother brown said that same
[1:27:16] one that presence you've been bumping
[1:27:18] into
[1:27:19] throughout your life bumping into it or
[1:27:21] was it god yes
[1:27:24] watching over you
[1:27:28] what do i do now recognize his presence
[1:27:31] recognize he's dealing with you
[1:27:33] recognize his desire to have a union and
[1:27:36] a relationship with you so you're no
[1:27:37] longer bumping in it you now live in it
[1:27:43] oh jesus hallelujah notice that he might
[1:27:46] dwell in thy courts
[1:27:48] look at this we shall be satisfied with
[1:27:50] the goodness
[1:27:52] of the house even
[1:27:54] of thy holy
[1:27:55] temple
[1:27:57] so god's made the way of approach paul
[1:28:00] would write of it in hebrews 10 19 i'm
[1:28:02] going to have to move here having
[1:28:04] therefore brethren boldness to enter
[1:28:06] into the holiest
[1:28:08] by the blood of jesus
[1:28:10] by a new and living way which he has
[1:28:12] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:28:15] is to say his flesh so this way that's
[1:28:18] been made through the shedding of the
[1:28:20] blood it was consecrated for you and i
[1:28:24] there was no way for us to get back into
[1:28:26] god's presence
[1:28:28] god
[1:28:29] came
[1:28:31] and he
[1:28:32] became the way
[1:28:36] he became he said i'm the way the truth
[1:28:38] he became the way
[1:28:40] back into the holiest of holies
[1:28:43] because you see when he came the second
[1:28:45] adam was made a quickening spirit when
[1:28:48] he came down what did he do he
[1:28:50] manifested
[1:28:52] what adam had in eden
[1:28:57] that's what he manifested he declared in
[1:29:00] his first coming what was lost
[1:29:05] in his second coming come on on the day
[1:29:07] of pentecost when he descended there
[1:29:10] that was a seal of the first company
[1:29:12] coming that opened the second coming and
[1:29:15] when that seal was given of the holy
[1:29:17] ghost what did it do it declared the
[1:29:19] same thing in those many membered bodies
[1:29:23] that it did in that one vessel where god
[1:29:27] became flesh it declared he was the same
[1:29:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:32] and then here at the ending of the
[1:29:34] gentile dispensation now
[1:29:36] here there in the climaxing the
[1:29:38] finishing up as he steps forward he
[1:29:41] comes in his fullness once again to
[1:29:44] declare himself that i am the same
[1:29:47] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:50] it declares you know what's being
[1:29:51] declared right now among the bride of
[1:29:53] jesus christ this is what the early
[1:29:55] church was
[1:29:58] come on now if that vine ever puts forth
[1:30:00] not the church
[1:30:02] if the vine ever puts forth if the vine
[1:30:04] never puts forth so the word giving
[1:30:06] birth to himself
[1:30:09] if that vine ever puts forth another
[1:30:12] branch
[1:30:13] it all right
[1:30:15] another book of acts behind how glorious
[1:30:18] is the branch of the lord in these last
[1:30:20] days
[1:30:21] what is a branch a yielded
[1:30:23] vessel
[1:30:27] that's been counted worthy to escape
[1:30:28] these things
[1:30:33] think about this how that
[1:30:35] god's made a way
[1:30:37] a confidence that we can come in to this
[1:30:40] place of a union with him and having
[1:30:42] over the high priest a high priest over
[1:30:44] the house of god remember we are that
[1:30:46] house we are that house
[1:30:49] this right here
[1:30:50] is a place that we've dedicated to come
[1:30:53] and to have fellowship with him
[1:30:56] to eat from the table
[1:30:58] to receive the ministering of the word
[1:31:02] right
[1:31:03] and then just inviting god to let that
[1:31:06] word that we heard we've ate on
[1:31:09] become flesh in us
[1:31:14] ben take me back to the courts please
[1:31:20] this is another place how brother
[1:31:21] branham
[1:31:23] would type this out so you can see this
[1:31:25] and find a good color here
[1:31:27] so you can see
[1:31:29] this he called it the kitchen
[1:31:32] this
[1:31:34] living room
[1:31:36] forgive my writing
[1:31:39] this
[1:31:40] bedroom
[1:31:44] kitchen you eat right
[1:31:47] and from the looks of us we enjoy it
[1:31:51] that right
[1:31:52] but now we must go from the kitchen to
[1:31:54] the living room the living room is where
[1:31:56] you you begin to rest from the food
[1:31:59] you've been eating
[1:32:01] are you hearing me man you get you you
[1:32:03] know you
[1:32:05] kick up you know
[1:32:10] like them comas we go into on
[1:32:11] thanksgiving
[1:32:13] or they call them carb comas
[1:32:17] but when does it go from a living room
[1:32:20] into the bedroom
[1:32:22] the bedroom is where we find rest
[1:32:24] the bedroom is where new life
[1:32:27] takes place
[1:32:32] okay ben going back
[1:32:39] so
[1:32:41] this whose house that we are now i want
[1:32:43] to
[1:32:45] uh
[1:32:46] just deal with this
[1:32:48] point here just a little bit on
[1:32:49] consecration and just
[1:32:51] just give me a few moments here on this
[1:32:53] just to lay this part in and
[1:32:56] the objective is to see it also if god
[1:32:58] will help us to come to a place even the
[1:32:59] beginning of this morning into a
[1:33:02] challenging place where it's a continual
[1:33:04] consecration in our life
[1:33:06] brother brown he deals with this this
[1:33:08] this quote has been one that i've just
[1:33:12] just
[1:33:13] in in listening to those messages and i
[1:33:15] told you here
[1:33:17] uh some weeks ago if you haven't
[1:33:19] listened to all you do is type in your
[1:33:20] app hidden life there's three messages
[1:33:23] with that title hidden life with christ
[1:33:26] they're not very long messages but those
[1:33:27] listen to those messages and then
[1:33:30] why some are so tossed about where i
[1:33:32] think pentecost failed and the interview
[1:33:34] all those are very this right here is
[1:33:37] where the inspiration
[1:33:39] and see it just continues to unfold
[1:33:40] through the message it doesn't it
[1:33:42] doesn't the message is not like
[1:33:44] segregated pieces it's a flow
[1:33:47] it's a whole picture
[1:33:50] it's not just isolated chunks it's a
[1:33:52] whole picture
[1:33:54] because you see god preparing the people
[1:33:56] god when in these messages like this god
[1:33:58] is preparing the people
[1:34:01] for what his desire is to be in our life
[1:34:04] god couldn't start the prophet's
[1:34:06] ministry out with the revealing of the
[1:34:07] seventh seal
[1:34:09] is that right
[1:34:11] but god it had to come now and with that
[1:34:13] unfolding of the seventh seal then
[1:34:15] that's identified as the capping of the
[1:34:18] token in our life
[1:34:20] where the headship of the word has come
[1:34:22] down
[1:34:25] i'm not trying to lose anybody but i
[1:34:27] don't these some some of these things
[1:34:28] here if you if you're getting lost
[1:34:30] sometimes let me just kind of encourage
[1:34:31] you and
[1:34:32] dig in a little bit
[1:34:34] dig in a little bit
[1:34:36] so
[1:34:38] brother brahmas is dealing with this
[1:34:40] here
[1:34:42] and he's talking about
[1:34:43] in our lives and he's talking about how
[1:34:45] that everything is in threes you know
[1:34:48] for a natural birth it's water spirit
[1:34:51] uh water blood and spirit right it's
[1:34:54] natural it's natural birth just in a
[1:34:55] hospital so forth
[1:34:57] it's the same those three
[1:34:59] elements are what constitute a spiritual
[1:35:02] birth
[1:35:03] there's a water of the word what's
[1:35:05] what's the water the preaching of the
[1:35:07] word brings conviction but also says
[1:35:09] this is the way yeah
[1:35:11] see it's it's to bring conviction and
[1:35:13] then to say this is the way
[1:35:16] come in hither
[1:35:19] the blood is holds within it the power
[1:35:22] to sanctify now we know it's not we
[1:35:25] don't have the literal blood of the lord
[1:35:26] jesus christ but it's the spirit of god
[1:35:29] that now can move into the depths of a
[1:35:32] life to dismantle
[1:35:34] worldly desires
[1:35:39] then
[1:35:40] comes forth the life on the inside that
[1:35:43] actually
[1:35:44] changes it brings new creation on the
[1:35:47] inside where the old man
[1:35:50] dies
[1:35:51] and a new man is raised up
[1:35:55] see this is something that we've talked
[1:35:56] about many times is that many times in
[1:35:58] the way things sometimes are taught and
[1:36:00] preached is that we're trying to get
[1:36:01] that old man saying we don't want that
[1:36:02] old god don't want to god's not
[1:36:04] interested in saving that old man god
[1:36:05] wants to kill him
[1:36:07] because why inside the seed that was
[1:36:10] shown inside our life there is that
[1:36:12] nature
[1:36:15] when you plant a tomato seed you don't
[1:36:16] have to cut it open and put a germ of a
[1:36:18] tomato plant in there it's already in
[1:36:20] there just get it in the ground get it
[1:36:23] in the right atmosphere at the right
[1:36:26] season it will start to progress and
[1:36:29] mature just like the words say it should
[1:36:34] what's doing it that tomato plant and
[1:36:36] saying oh let me try to be what's on the
[1:36:40] back of this of this tomato plant
[1:36:43] let me try to do it no
[1:36:46] it's just drink drink
[1:36:48] push
[1:36:50] drink drink push out why
[1:36:53] because what it is
[1:36:55] everything has already been packed
[1:36:58] inside of that seed
[1:37:02] you can't unpack it
[1:37:04] i can't unpack it
[1:37:07] but the god who packed it is the one who
[1:37:09] unpacks it
[1:37:13] hallelujah
[1:37:18] don't worry i won't get there with the
[1:37:19] brothers not packing their own suitcases
[1:37:26] but notice brother brown brings that in
[1:37:28] to those three places justification
[1:37:31] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:37:34] i want you to catch what he says here i
[1:37:35] think i gave this one to you out of
[1:37:37] hidden life
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:40] brother brown says it like this uh he
[1:37:42] says there's
[1:37:44] too many of us can you get to that place
[1:37:46] here uh
[1:37:48] maybe up a little okay
[1:37:51] yeah there we go
[1:37:52] he said there's too many of us playing
[1:37:54] in the courts yet
[1:37:57] that's a powerful statement
[1:37:58] too many are playing in the courts what
[1:38:01] does they mean by playing it doesn't
[1:38:03] mean that people are being disrespectful
[1:38:04] or irreverent
[1:38:06] it means that they're not
[1:38:08] really
[1:38:09] focused
[1:38:11] and listen
[1:38:13] when you've repented of your sins hey we
[1:38:16] all know
[1:38:17] it's like a load goes off of you
[1:38:20] is that i mean it's a load because why
[1:38:22] it's coming into the identification of
[1:38:24] what he already did
[1:38:26] he don't come down right here oh i'm
[1:38:28] going to come down and forgive your sins
[1:38:29] he makes real what he already did
[1:38:32] he already packed it away
[1:38:35] now we are having the experience of that
[1:38:39] see he said there's too many of us
[1:38:40] playing in the court yet so what now i
[1:38:43] want you to speak i want you just to
[1:38:44] work with me here a moment this this
[1:38:46] statement here because i'm not going to
[1:38:48] leave this just out here in a
[1:38:49] justification sanctification point
[1:38:51] that's not how god dealt with me when
[1:38:53] we're playing two rounds when brother
[1:38:55] graham says just playing blessed playing
[1:38:56] too much in the courts yet it deals with
[1:38:59] god calling us to even a greater
[1:39:02] sincerity
[1:39:04] and devotedness in our lives
[1:39:08] the worst curse that could ever be upon
[1:39:10] us is we set back like we got it made
[1:39:15] the seal of god does not do that
[1:39:18] amen
[1:39:20] look how paul would write of his own
[1:39:21] life i count not my own self
[1:39:26] that word count means think
[1:39:28] to be perfect
[1:39:31] but yet he was he already had the
[1:39:32] perfection of god in his soul by the
[1:39:34] baptism of the holy ghost but he
[1:39:36] recognized there as long as i live every
[1:39:39] day every moment it's got to be a
[1:39:41] further maturing and growing in the
[1:39:43] presence of almighty god
[1:39:46] amen
[1:39:48] there's too many of us playing in the
[1:39:50] courts yet we don't look at this we
[1:39:53] don't take our lives over with christ
[1:39:57] to be hid away
[1:40:00] we don't
[1:40:01] brother says the fruits of the spirit
[1:40:03] proves that
[1:40:06] it goes on he says we might think we are
[1:40:08] but until your life measures up that's
[1:40:09] what proves it
[1:40:12] i don't want to deal with the fruits of
[1:40:13] the spirit today but you know peace long
[1:40:15] suffering joy and love and i'm both
[1:40:17] saying i've got such joy really
[1:40:20] tell your faith
[1:40:24] hopefully samuel i got such long
[1:40:25] suffering i can't stand that sister
[1:40:27] really
[1:40:29] really
[1:40:31] it might need to be a little bit of work
[1:40:33] in the courts
[1:40:39] well who keeps up the courts the priest
[1:40:46] we just say with today's message
[1:40:50] by their fruit problem says he said by
[1:40:53] their fruit you shall know them not by
[1:40:54] their denomination but by their fruit
[1:40:56] you shall know them if i can bring this
[1:40:58] on down here it's not by what church you
[1:41:00] go to
[1:41:01] who a pastor is or i believe brother
[1:41:03] brahm's a prophet or i believe this
[1:41:04] message it's not known by that
[1:41:09] if you have to tell somebody you're a
[1:41:11] christian
[1:41:13] you need a voice that's greater than
[1:41:15] your voice
[1:41:18] me preach
[1:41:19] because it must be god declare those
[1:41:24] that are his amen abel obtained a
[1:41:27] witness that he was righteous right
[1:41:30] oh my that's what the abiding presence
[1:41:32] it
[1:41:33] it moves and it does upon our life it
[1:41:36] identifies us as believers
[1:41:38] brother baby goes into the fruits of the
[1:41:39] spirit and he says now
[1:41:41] it's love joy peace long suffering
[1:41:43] goodness
[1:41:44] gentleness patience
[1:41:46] meekness shoe boy these are all good
[1:41:50] temperance
[1:41:51] i just can't help it temperance is
[1:41:53] self-control
[1:42:00] man
[1:42:01] we got to go
[1:42:07] he said well we needed more fruit more
[1:42:09] lives to prove it
[1:42:10] he said we've had testimonies i want you
[1:42:12] to catch this thought
[1:42:14] i'm going to need about 15 more minutes
[1:42:16] can i have that
[1:42:17] i want to get us to it to a certain spot
[1:42:19] but don't don't leave on me yet
[1:42:21] we've had many testimonies
[1:42:23] but as the old saying is your life
[1:42:26] speaks so loud
[1:42:28] i can't hear
[1:42:30] your voice
[1:42:31] now notice we had many testimonies
[1:42:35] was he talking about testimonies here
[1:42:38] but he's bringing it back to
[1:42:40] it's not this that really matters it's
[1:42:42] what comes out of here
[1:42:44] god never said he'd put the testimony in
[1:42:46] here
[1:42:49] but he said the testimony i give you i
[1:42:52] already have provided for myself a place
[1:42:55] to put this testimony
[1:42:58] what task one place is that the show the
[1:43:00] seed of god and then god said because
[1:43:03] that testimony is there then it will
[1:43:06] affect this
[1:43:08] and you will speak my word by the
[1:43:10] indwelling of my presence
[1:43:13] back to eden again
[1:43:17] oh my where i think pentecost failed i'm
[1:43:19] reading these very very very
[1:43:20] intentionally here
[1:43:22] the man says uh you know he's talking
[1:43:24] about
[1:43:25] uh he said we walk close to god he's
[1:43:27] encouraging my brethren come into the
[1:43:29] holiest of holies come in and live
[1:43:30] before god to the holy spirit which
[1:43:33] takes him message day by day how you're
[1:43:36] progressing in his kingdom how you're
[1:43:38] treating his children and what all
[1:43:40] you're doing till the father will say i
[1:43:44] have found grace in him now i'll bring
[1:43:46] him over here before the people
[1:43:50] then go back to the drawing please
[1:43:57] remember brother branham
[1:43:59] paul picks this up in galatians 3 and
[1:44:01] galatians 4
[1:44:02] on the adoption right
[1:44:04] of children
[1:44:06] the adoption is not separate from the
[1:44:08] new birth
[1:44:09] the adoption is the placing in christ
[1:44:13] and we grow in maturity
[1:44:16] are you with me this is the place right
[1:44:19] here this right here is the place of
[1:44:22] adoption this is the place where sons
[1:44:25] and daughters of god become manifest
[1:44:27] from
[1:44:28] are you with me receiving the same seed
[1:44:31] life
[1:44:32] now upon that seed it brings forth a son
[1:44:35] and daughter of god
[1:44:36] now when god's dealing with our hearts
[1:44:39] as we come in here coming to the outer
[1:44:41] court we're hearing the word enjoying
[1:44:43] the word a lot of times you know a
[1:44:45] person can start to do the outward form
[1:44:47] of things oh we don't do this outwardly
[1:44:49] okay i don't do that outwardly oh okay
[1:44:51] we don't do this okay we don't that's
[1:44:53] that's wonderful that's all that's part
[1:44:55] of the journey
[1:44:57] are you with me this is why brother
[1:44:59] branham when you take the whole canon of
[1:45:01] messages hear ye him
[1:45:04] and brother brahma preached that whole
[1:45:06] series in place of messages and he's
[1:45:08] dealing with he says
[1:45:10] people who've given their lives to god
[1:45:13] and they're still smoking
[1:45:14] still cutting her hair still doing other
[1:45:16] things and he says the holy spirit is
[1:45:19] taking messages back the holy spirit's
[1:45:21] taking messages back to the throne on
[1:45:23] our behavior
[1:45:26] what's he dealing with because remember
[1:45:28] a person can come right here in the
[1:45:29] outer court and they still got all the
[1:45:31] same sinful desires within them
[1:45:34] they've been baptized in the name of the
[1:45:35] lord jesus christ repented of sin that's
[1:45:38] remission for
[1:45:40] past
[1:45:41] all right
[1:45:42] all right pass remission of past so
[1:45:45] whatever is like chasing you down that's
[1:45:47] what repentance does it cuts that off
[1:45:50] when you repent so you got freedom to go
[1:45:52] forward
[1:45:54] in other words so you're not carrying
[1:45:55] the same baggage to come before him and
[1:45:57] say father i need a full work you
[1:46:00] forgave me remitted all previous sins i
[1:46:04] need a full work to take out the root
[1:46:06] that caused that in the first
[1:46:10] amen see these place sons of god and
[1:46:13] dollars of god coming in and remember
[1:46:15] it's a progressing as it comes even into
[1:46:17] this place here into the holiest of
[1:46:19] holies or not this is the holy so holy
[1:46:21] but it comes into this place right here
[1:46:23] and this is the place that i want to
[1:46:25] actually kind of just speak just a few
[1:46:28] moments
[1:46:28] about this place right here
[1:46:30] this place right here
[1:46:33] is a place
[1:46:35] of consecration
[1:46:37] and i'm just gonna i don't know if i'll
[1:46:39] go back to my notes or not because i
[1:46:40] have what's on my heart anyhow this is a
[1:46:43] place of consecration right here
[1:46:48] remember
[1:46:49] in our lives think how paul would deal
[1:46:51] with this
[1:46:53] paul would speak
[1:46:55] through the word
[1:46:56] of what god has ordained us to be
[1:47:00] no you're not you're a temple your
[1:47:02] body's a temple of the holy ghost what's
[1:47:03] him letting him know hey
[1:47:05] hey
[1:47:06] this is
[1:47:07] you're not here just to go about
[1:47:09] everyday life you're here to be a
[1:47:10] witness
[1:47:12] oh i'm to be a temple of the living god
[1:47:15] see what's he beginning to do it's god
[1:47:17] who's beginning to unfold the mystery of
[1:47:20] your
[1:47:23] nobody can take the seals off of your
[1:47:26] book
[1:47:27] like he can
[1:47:29] and it takes a bloody lamb to come into
[1:47:32] your life and take the seals off
[1:47:36] but see you were sealed up so no other
[1:47:38] life could enter
[1:47:40] is that right
[1:47:42] so he moves in now he begins to make
[1:47:44] known to you your rights the bible says
[1:47:48] as many as received him to them he gave
[1:47:50] the power
[1:47:52] that was excusia
[1:47:53] that's right
[1:47:55] to become
[1:47:57] sons of god
[1:47:58] at that point you see in order to
[1:48:00] receive the dunamis the power of god the
[1:48:03] transforming power of god you have to
[1:48:05] know the rights that belong to you amen
[1:48:07] and you know what you're coming for
[1:48:08] you're not coming as a pulper a beggar
[1:48:11] or a you're you're coming in a manner to
[1:48:12] say lord i'm a son of god and you
[1:48:14] promised lord the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:48:16] is that right galatians 4 because ye our
[1:48:19] sons he has sent forth the holy ghost

[1:48:29] rightfully belongs to us what you're
[1:48:31] doing it's calling us to a place of
[1:48:33] consecration because what's a place of
[1:48:35] consecration it's a place of separation

[1:50:16] mark right here
[1:50:19] you have the candlesticks
[1:50:22] that give light
[1:50:24] what do the candlesticks do
[1:50:27] it's a further opening
[1:50:29] and a pointing to that way what do the
[1:50:31] candlesticks do they give light over
[1:50:33] against the veil
[1:50:35] the light the the seven messengers in
[1:50:37] the right hand what are they doing
[1:50:39] reflecting the way to the throne
[1:50:41] what's the weight to the throne right
[1:50:43] here

[1:50:48] god's life into the church yes
[1:50:51] amen oh glory be to god yes you're with
[1:50:54] me
[1:50:55] so it's saying it's emitting that to
[1:50:58] come into that place of holiest of
[1:51:00] holies so it's a place of consecration
[1:51:03] this place in here of consecration it's
[1:51:06] a place of sanctification
[1:51:08] you might say
[1:51:10] sanctification this is where the desires
[1:51:12] and the things of the world are falling
[1:51:15] away what's what's happening it's not
[1:51:17] it's not a matter of oh i can't do this
[1:51:19] or i shouldn't do this it's moving into
[1:51:21] that place see it becomes a consecration
[1:51:23] i want to be united with jesus christ
[1:51:28] a place of consecration
[1:51:30] will lead to a life
[1:51:33] of consecration
[1:51:36] and a life of consecration
[1:51:38] will keep us in a place of consecration
[1:51:41] to reflect the life of consecration
[1:51:44] i didn't lose nobody did i
[1:51:46] if i lost brother brian we're in trouble
[1:51:50] a place of consecration is where we're
[1:51:52] putting ourselves the word is dealing
[1:51:54] with our lives the word is speaking to
[1:51:56] us and here we are yielding to that word
[1:51:58] and that word is washing us
[1:52:00] it's changing us what is that we're
[1:52:02] doing he's coming and so the word is
[1:52:05] leading to a deeper experience in our
[1:52:07] life let me just say this to you
[1:52:10] no matter where your experience has been
[1:52:13] we thank god for every experience
[1:52:19] there's an experience as i said when a
[1:52:20] person is justified they have an
[1:52:22] experience
[1:52:24] yes we all did i remember what that was
[1:52:26] like when i was in the brother bill's
[1:52:27] basement
[1:52:29] god's grace coming down
[1:52:31] i also know the experience of
[1:52:33] sanctification
[1:52:37] where things you know i knew had to be
[1:52:39] taken out of my life i knew
[1:52:41] i knew
[1:52:42] a lot of stuff had to be taken out of my
[1:52:44] life i knew
[1:52:45] and i already knew from from previous
[1:52:47] times i can't do it on my own
[1:52:50] you know what that was fearful because i
[1:52:52] knew i tried before and i couldn't do it
[1:52:55] i tried before and i couldn't do it he
[1:52:58] said brother say man what was different
[1:52:59] is just putting it in his hands and
[1:53:01] coming to that place i don't want this
[1:53:03] no more
[1:53:06] it's not just well this ain't no good
[1:53:07] this ain't this ain't good for me oh
[1:53:09] this is bad for my life this people in
[1:53:11] the world do that
[1:53:12] people in the world they they go to aaa
[1:53:15] and everything else i don't need this
[1:53:16] this is hindering my career this is
[1:53:18] doing this they do all of that for the
[1:53:19] natural but that's not how it is with
[1:53:21] the believer you're not serving god if
[1:53:24] for that reason it's consecrating
[1:53:26] yourself to the holy ghost who's dealing
[1:53:29] with your life and says god take me over
[1:53:32] completely
[1:53:36] tired of living an up and down life and
[1:53:38] having to pray through a day in and day
[1:53:40] out but we all got to pray through but
[1:53:41] you understand what brother graham is
[1:53:42] saying on that right there is to where
[1:53:44] we come to that settlement on the inside
[1:53:46] that i know that i know that i know that
[1:53:48] i know i pass from death unto life
[1:53:53] and in that place of consecration
[1:53:59] he takes us
[1:54:01] into the life
[1:54:03] of consecration
[1:54:05] amen
[1:54:06] then with the life of consecration
[1:54:10] it'll reflect out here
[1:54:12] it'll reflect out here
[1:54:15] this is why out here we do the things we
[1:54:17] do
[1:54:18] out here visibly
[1:54:20] is because there's a consecrated life
[1:54:22] that's consecrated to the word
[1:54:25] this is why we need the word to come and
[1:54:27] say
[1:54:28] it's a dress
[1:54:31] but you don't meet the standards
[1:54:37] that's why we need that
[1:54:39] this is why we need the word to come and
[1:54:41] deal with things in our family life
[1:54:46] what does it do that brings us to a
[1:54:48] place to consecrate ourselves before the
[1:54:50] living god and say lord
[1:54:53] change me
[1:54:55] from glory
[1:54:56] unto glory
[1:54:57] unto glory
[1:54:59] unto glory unto glory unto
[1:55:02] glory amen
[1:55:07] a consecration
[1:55:09] to god
[1:55:11] i'm just going to close here
[1:55:16] this is the this is the this is the
[1:55:18] place
[1:55:21] uh
[1:55:22] in this place here
[1:55:25] this is the type right here
[1:55:28] man let me see if i can just
[1:55:30] this is just
[1:55:33] uh
[1:55:34] ben close it off just for a second
[1:55:38] thank you
[1:55:42] okay go back to it
[1:55:47] that's better oh no it's not
[1:55:56] i need like four of these slides gotta
[1:55:58] remember to do that remind you you boys
[1:56:00] remind me to do that say dad duplicate
[1:56:02] that slide so you can keep drawing this
[1:56:04] area right here
[1:56:05] this area
[1:56:08] that's a spirit realm
[1:56:11] god's abiding presence
[1:56:14] and where life is consecrated then when
[1:56:16] the word comes and deals with our lives
[1:56:18] on things
[1:56:20] what rises up
[1:56:22] is that seed word on the inside that
[1:56:24] says yeah lord
[1:56:27] god says
[1:56:30] your attitude about something is just
[1:56:31] not right
[1:56:32] where's that at it's not in your soul
[1:56:35] it's your spirit all right all right
[1:56:38] but god i i need a priest no i have made
[1:56:41] you kings
[1:56:42] and priests
[1:56:45] i've made you to take order and as a
[1:56:48] king authority to dismantle what needs
[1:56:50] to be dismantled amen
[1:56:58] you may just let me close with this so
[1:56:59] you can see it has is this challenges
[1:57:01] brother aaron all of our lives
[1:57:03] brother branham
[1:57:06] stands there in the message jubilee year
[1:57:08] jubilee year
[1:57:10] he just preached word made flesh india
[1:57:13] trip that morning
[1:57:15] and in that service i've told you this
[1:57:17] many times i appreciate how brother
[1:57:19] branham was so transparent
[1:57:23] this to me shows a son of god coming to
[1:57:26] maturity
[1:57:28] because the son of god coming to
[1:57:29] maturity don't try to shove blame it
[1:57:31] takes responsibility
[1:57:37] god began to deal with his life he said
[1:57:39] i begin to see a selfish spirit
[1:57:41] rising up in me
[1:57:44] he called it further in that message a
[1:57:46] critical spirit
[1:57:49] he said because he had read something
[1:57:51] about a certain minister
[1:57:53] and he said here i was is criticizing
[1:57:58] and he says i've asked god and i asked
[1:58:00] the congregation please pray for me
[1:58:03] that god
[1:58:04] will
[1:58:05] forgive me
[1:58:06] and remove that from my life
[1:58:10] jubilee year
[1:58:12] he preaches that night guess what that
[1:58:14] guess what that service is all about
[1:58:16] it's a communion service
[1:58:18] brother samuel you mean he didn't have a
[1:58:21] month of paintings
[1:58:22] come on we've been delivered from roman
[1:58:24] catholic catholicism
[1:58:26] you mean he didn't have a week
[1:58:28] to know
[1:58:31] come on we're talking about the
[1:58:33] righteousness of the blood of jesus
[1:58:34] christ
[1:58:35] brother when you have repented from your
[1:58:38] heart it's gone
[1:58:41] it's gone right there
[1:58:44] don't let the devil hanging over your
[1:58:46] head and try to what's he trying to do
[1:58:48] operate right in here in memory
[1:58:52] but as a priest of god that's a gate
[1:58:55] that belongs to you as a porter
[1:58:58] a porter is one who stands at that gate
[1:59:00] as a responsibility and says i will only
[1:59:04] only only think upon things of a good
[1:59:06] report those things that are virtue true
[1:59:08] praise if nothing else if they don't
[1:59:10] come out dismiss it
[1:59:14] i'm kind of getting in the head of
[1:59:15] myself here but we're just going to go
[1:59:18] but i'm just stopping on this point
[1:59:25] brother branham steps in that message
[1:59:29] and he's asked the church and jubilee
[1:59:30] year that night
[1:59:32] he said will you pray for he says i've
[1:59:34] asked god
[1:59:35] to forgive me he said has each of you
[1:59:38] have asked god to forgive you now there
[1:59:39] was all sorts of things when brother
[1:59:41] bran preached jubilee year there was
[1:59:42] people who needed to really meet the
[1:59:44] lord face to face in that service
[1:59:47] see the word deals with all levels in
[1:59:49] the service
[1:59:51] it has to
[1:59:53] it dealt with that then you have brother
[1:59:55] branham coming around and there's other
[1:59:57] lives that need to be dealt with because
[1:59:59] they're carrying weights
[2:00:01] and see god doesn't want us coming
[2:00:04] to the communion table with weights
[2:00:07] sometimes weight loaded down with
[2:00:09] weights we're carrying burdens that he's
[2:00:11] already carried
[2:00:14] sometimes we're carrying burdens that
[2:00:16] all we have to do is come to the
[2:00:18] realization repent and recognize him as
[2:00:21] our burden bearer
[2:00:26] amen and brother braham says now has we
[2:00:28] come to this communion table he said
[2:00:30] i've asked you to pray for me that god
[2:00:32] would forgive me and cleanse me of that
[2:00:35] critical
[2:00:36] spirit
[2:00:38] but joshua where was that was that his
[2:00:40] soul
[2:00:41] no
[2:00:42] it was in the spirit realm
[2:00:45] what was it a place of consecration that
[2:00:48] leads to a life of consecration
[2:00:50] you see the word deals with our life you
[2:00:52] say but the same i thought i'm living in
[2:00:54] here this is a life of consecration but
[2:00:56] a life of consecration will always
[2:00:57] consecrate itself to the word
[2:00:59] when correction comes it'll take
[2:01:01] correction
[2:01:03] you know what is it doing it's showing
[2:01:05] what it is
[2:01:07] it's the testimony that identifies
[2:01:10] itself with the word
[2:01:13] this is why that in here in this spirit
[2:01:15] realm sometimes we can get soul and out
[2:01:17] here
[2:01:18] so occupied with the things of life
[2:01:24] that we forget
[2:01:25] you got to feed this inner man
[2:01:29] so occupied and yet many of these things
[2:01:31] out in here we have family life out here
[2:01:35] home life
[2:01:37] all of our dealings but remember
[2:01:40] all of this out here
[2:01:42] all of this see this is what people see
[2:01:43] right here well we've got a mess up here
[2:01:45] don't we
[2:01:46] this is what people see if i keep doing
[2:01:48] this you'll see it
[2:01:49] this is what people see
[2:01:51] this is what people see
[2:01:52] people see out here
[2:01:55] whatever's back here
[2:01:57] and we're responsible don't let anything
[2:02:00] get between
[2:02:01] this
[2:02:02] and that amen
[2:02:06] what do i do keep the lamps trimmed
[2:02:10] so the fire burns bright
[2:02:12] it's a place of consecration
[2:02:16] that leads to a life of consecration
[2:02:19] and dwelling in that life of
[2:02:21] consecration by the new birth
[2:02:23] it brings us to a place
[2:02:26] of examining our lives lord
[2:02:29] am i where you want me to be
[2:02:34] now that examination of are you am i
[2:02:37] where you where you want me to be
[2:02:40] you can look in the courts outer court
[2:02:42] inner court holies of holies
[2:02:44] and there should be a be real honest
[2:02:46] with god
[2:02:48] but let's say for those of us here
[2:02:51] that's already into the holies of
[2:02:53] holiness this is still an examination
[2:02:56] am i living
[2:02:58] where you want me to live
[2:03:02] see god lived in the other courts but
[2:03:04] his abiding presence was in the
[2:03:07] holiest of holiness
[2:03:08] so the question becomes
[2:03:11] am i
[2:03:12] living
[2:03:14] by the abiding presence
[2:03:16] through the other courts of my life
[2:03:20] am i allowing the word
[2:03:22] to discern
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:24] thoughts
[2:03:25] in my heart
[2:03:27] am i allowing the word to deal with
[2:03:31] conscience memory reason affection
[2:03:35] imagination come on listen we're not
[2:03:38] exempt from these things
[2:03:40] imagination brother braham says you have
[2:03:42] somebody just he said somebody in the
[2:03:43] church he just walks by you and all of a
[2:03:45] sudden he said the devil said
[2:03:47] that brother didn't want to shake your
[2:03:48] hand that brother where is that at
[2:03:51] if it's a real son of god or daughter of
[2:03:54] god on the inside they'll come to it
[2:03:56] eventually and realizing it's only the
[2:03:59] enemy putting a roadblock in there
[2:04:04] and as a son and daughter of god listen
[2:04:06] i don't know they might go a day might
[2:04:08] go an hour might go a month i don't know
[2:04:10] but a son and daughter of god they
[2:04:12] cannot stay in that way because why we
[2:04:15] are made to express and display the
[2:04:19] glory of god and god's glory cannot be
[2:04:23] expressed when our imagination against a
[2:04:26] brother against the sister against
[2:04:28] anybody else when that is
[2:04:29] clogged up
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:37] you love him
[2:04:41] then you can change it back oh you did
[2:04:51] i trust with all my heart
[2:04:54] and i believe
[2:04:57] this is our desire and i want to say
[2:04:59] this to
[2:05:01] each one of you
[2:05:03] i'm not here we have not been here this
[2:05:05] morning or any other day to scold
[2:05:06] anybody
[2:05:08] there's times sometimes where correction
[2:05:10] or something needs to be given but i
[2:05:11] look at this
[2:05:13] these are things god's dealing with our
[2:05:14] heart
[2:05:16] in such a personal way and you take
[2:05:17] brother you take brother nathan
[2:05:20] now i'm on i'm on a thread with brother
[2:05:22] nathan along with other ministers as
[2:05:23] well
[2:05:24] but these things right here we're not
[2:05:26] discussing i don't i just i don't
[2:05:27] discuss what i preach
[2:05:30] i don't know
[2:05:32] but god had brother nathan come in here
[2:05:34] first report i
[2:05:35] have before before i ever
[2:05:37] you know pull up the surface
[2:05:39] first report i get
[2:05:41] how everything has
[2:05:42] god just coming together of course he
[2:05:43] did a much better job
[2:05:51] but it ain't about doing a better job
[2:05:53] it's just what god puts on our hearts
[2:05:57] i look at this
[2:05:58] and i just think it's a great
[2:06:00] opportunity for us as this assembly
[2:06:05] that if our life isn't there yet it's an
[2:06:07] opportunity
[2:06:09] that we can come out of playing in the
[2:06:11] courts
[2:06:13] to really get serious with god
[2:06:16] to really get serious
[2:06:18] i mean you know sometimes you have to
[2:06:20] tell your kids i mean
[2:06:23] call nobody's name out but
[2:06:26] he and i kind of like to have some i
[2:06:28] like to have fun you know i like to have
[2:06:29] fun but sometimes i have to tell him
[2:06:32] it's time to be serious
[2:06:34] he's to try to go that extra little bit
[2:06:37] you know
[2:06:38] wanting to say that funny little line
[2:06:39] you know and
[2:06:42] hey we got to be serious
[2:06:44] it's time it's time to be serious
[2:06:47] why because what we're getting ready to
[2:06:49] come into
[2:06:50] is going to take a serious approach
[2:06:53] the time we're living in
[2:06:55] it requires a serious approach and i'm
[2:06:57] not just talking about
[2:06:58] when i say the time we're living in the
[2:07:00] bride of christ
[2:07:03] is unlike israel
[2:07:05] because israel was moved back into their
[2:07:08] homeland by national
[2:07:10] forces the bride is not moved by
[2:07:13] national pressures
[2:07:15] you know i'm quoting
[2:07:16] it's the spirit of god that puts the
[2:07:18] people in the bride
[2:07:20] see we're not people can look out here
[2:07:22] you know you people go oh my look at
[2:07:24] this and look at that but the reality is
[2:07:27] it no matter if all these things that
[2:07:28] can be seen
[2:07:30] if you can't discerning the time
[2:07:33] is discerning our lives
[2:07:36] discerning who's in our midst and
[2:07:38] discerning our lives i think it's
[2:07:40] awesome i think it's a great opportunity
[2:07:41] and i think it's
[2:07:43] it's a responsibility right now that we
[2:07:45] would as brother brown says take our
[2:07:47] lives
[2:07:49] out of these other courts
[2:07:51] and into that holiest of holies you see
[2:07:54] what he's saying is
[2:07:57] it's a christian life isn't just living
[2:07:59] in the outer court right where the
[2:08:01] prayer where are you oh man the word of
[2:08:02] god this is so sweet that's so good but
[2:08:05] brother bram says
[2:08:06] you get out in front of all the people
[2:08:08] at your job and on the work and you'll
[2:08:09] denounce him in a minute go back to
[2:08:11] everything else you've ever done that's
[2:08:12] outer court
[2:08:18] is to take our lives out of the inner
[2:08:20] court
[2:08:22] where it's it's not about just our mind
[2:08:24] now is set we don't do this we do this
[2:08:26] and we don't do this we do this
[2:08:28] it's moving into that place of a
[2:08:30] relationship with him
[2:08:32] to where our life
[2:08:34] is changed
[2:08:36] but samuel i need to understand it
[2:08:38] before i can receive it satan's told you
[2:08:40] that lie
[2:08:42] you need to believe it
[2:08:46] not understand it believe
[2:08:48] it and how do i believe it look at
[2:08:51] wherever your life is where are you
[2:08:53] dwelling
[2:08:54] and say god
[2:08:56] take me
[2:08:57] in
[2:08:58] to the holy of holies
[2:09:01] and if your life is order and if he's
[2:09:03] not there let him take you there really
[2:09:05] pour your heart out be honest with him
[2:09:07] what is that that's a place of
[2:09:08] consecration the place of consecrations
[2:09:10] right here that doesn't end with church
[2:09:13] it goes out of here
[2:09:15] it goes out of here
[2:09:17] and then
[2:09:18] he takes you into that place
[2:09:20] and then now the word abiding in your
[2:09:22] life then you can
[2:09:24] you stand there before the word lord
[2:09:26] let every action speak of you
[2:09:30] see let every life let every let it be
[2:09:32] let my life be
[2:09:33] a testimony not my words
[2:09:36] but my life
[2:09:39] see the things that we do
[2:09:41] and we say sometimes the things that we
[2:09:43] don't do
[2:09:44] say things
[2:09:45] this is where it takes an evaluation in
[2:09:47] our life
[2:09:48] i said i was going to close but i just
[2:09:51] i feel very very much upon my heart
[2:09:53] within this controversy don't don't
[2:09:55] don't let these things go away but ask
[2:09:57] god say lord for all of our lives mine
[2:10:00] included is oh god
[2:10:02] i want to live
[2:10:04] consecrated
[2:10:05] to the word of god
[2:10:08] i want to i don't want to see how close
[2:10:10] i can get to the edge brother gabriel i
[2:10:11] want to hug that mountain i don't
[2:10:14] believe in tree huggers but i believe in
[2:10:15] mountain huggers
[2:10:19] hugging that mountain i don't want to
[2:10:20] see how close i can get to the right i
[2:10:22] want to club that mountain
[2:10:25] i want to stay close to him is to take
[2:10:28] inventory in her own life
[2:10:31] oh god let everything be lined with you
[2:10:35] let's pray
[2:10:37] heavenly father
[2:10:40] dear god
[2:10:42] it's in your presence
[2:10:45] that lord you
[2:10:46] draw us
[2:10:48] to approach you as david said
[2:10:51] that we might dwell not go in and out in
[2:10:53] and out in and out in and out but come
[2:10:55] to a place of dwelling
[2:10:58] in you
[2:11:00] and there as david said we'll be
[2:11:03] satisfied
[2:11:04] with the goodness of thy house lord
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:08] i'm asking right here this morning
[2:11:11] i can't give anybody the holy ghost i
[2:11:13] realize that
[2:11:14] but i can pray god
[2:11:16] and ask that lord according to their
[2:11:18] faith and the desire of their heart
[2:11:21] then lord if it has never come to that
[2:11:24] place of a real
[2:11:25] consecrated life that's
[2:11:28] really hidden away with you to where
[2:11:31] it's just satisfied with jesus
[2:11:35] it don't matter what the boss is saying
[2:11:37] it don't matter what
[2:11:39] suzy's saying it don't matter what
[2:11:40] nobody else is saying it's satisfied
[2:11:44] with you
[2:11:49] there's an abiding presence on the
[2:11:51] inside
[2:11:52] [Music]
[2:11:53] then lord
[2:11:55] it governs our life
[2:11:58] the word itself governs our life it
[2:12:01] directs our life
[2:12:03] to take accountability
[2:12:06] to rule our own spirit
[2:12:11] it directs us lord
[2:12:13] to where
[2:12:15] in our lives
[2:12:16] not just by what we can say what we can
[2:12:18] quote
[2:12:20] that's where we go to church
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:24] below god
[2:12:26] a life that bears witness
[2:12:28] through us lord
[2:12:31] that we are the children of god
[2:12:34] lord i pray in this moment of
[2:12:36] consecration
[2:12:37] i ask god right through this
[2:12:39] congregation all of us lord as the
[2:12:40] prophet himself was very open and very
[2:12:42] honest
[2:12:44] lord perhaps right here this morning
[2:12:46] there's hearts and lives that could say
[2:12:47] lord
[2:12:49] i want to move back to that place of
[2:12:50] consecration i've let a little few
[2:12:52] things slip in my life i've let some
[2:12:54] things slip in here lord that's
[2:12:55] hindering that expression lord
[2:12:58] of that victory
[2:13:00] there's little things i've let clutter
[2:13:02] up
[2:13:03] things i've let come between me and my
[2:13:04] prayer my prayer life things i've let me
[2:13:06] come between me and being in the house
[2:13:08] of god things that i've allowed to come
[2:13:10] between me
[2:13:12] my brother my sister lord
[2:13:14] i want to move and come into that place
[2:13:16] of consecration i want to consecrate my
[2:13:19] life
[2:13:20] to that word lord a re-dedication
[2:13:25] a refilling lord
[2:13:29] because after all you put me here on
[2:13:31] this earth to be a testimony
[2:13:34] a trophy
[2:13:36] of your redeeming grace
[2:13:38] this world is not my home i'm just
[2:13:40] passing through
[2:13:42] my treasures are laid up somewhere
[2:13:43] beyond the blue
[2:13:45] i'm just passing through
[2:13:48] oh god granted this morning
[2:13:51] hallelujah throughout this congregation
[2:13:53] lord may our hearts remove be moved in
[2:13:56] consecration lord

[2:14:00] consecration that lord
[2:14:02] for lives to move lord deeper taking
[2:14:04] their lives out of the other courts and
[2:14:07] now coming into a place lord to say god
[2:14:10] let the abiding presence of the holy
[2:14:12] ghost
[2:14:14] to be hid away shut away with god in
[2:14:17] that secret place that place
[2:14:19] that like israel knew
[2:14:22] you were behind the veil by faith they
[2:14:25] knew that while the rest of the world
[2:14:27] could look
[2:14:28] no matter what they said we know
[2:14:31] that something has happened inside
[2:14:34] we know
[2:14:36] that god is seated
[2:14:38] in his rightful position in our lives
[2:14:40] the word has preeminence
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:44] this is what we desire lord
[2:14:47] i ask god that for every life that's

[2:16:25] oh god as your prophet taught us
[2:16:29] that when we go to thinking we've got a
[2:16:30] right

[2:16:43] inside to the outside let god whatever
[2:16:45] that needs to be brought in line in
