thank you Father for real godly mothers lord and lives Lord that are laid down father Lord for this gospel we give you praise and thanks and our Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen they're taking that up turn to Colossians chapter one and thinking musicians may God bless you and say god bless you to each one of the mothers that are here today and it's true you know it's uh it's a day and I know we can talk about the commercialization and things like that but I tell you what it's it's certainly one thing that you're blessed if you have your mother here with you today not only here but you know even if maybe it's not here in this assembly there's I know there's some that the mothers are not here and you know you just think of that you never know when it's gonna be maybe the last time you don't know that you know and I just want to say we so appreciate each and every one of our sisters and mothers that just really just standing and shining the gospel amen the light of this word in in the homeland among the children and among one another it's just I tell you that's a real real real blessing you say amen amen I tell you I'm so thankful for that I I think back too many times I remember you know my mom praying and you know in my and my dad and things like that and probably the one it's not that I remember them praying and praying with me and I hearing them pray but I'll tell you the one that you know I had to come inside from playing and that was my grandma my Mamaw browning when I stayed with her it was when she when she hollered I knew it was time to come inside but I knew this was gonna be a long break and I had to sit right there on the couch while she prayed but I'm so glad for that I'm so glad for that you know she she really just she really talked with him and and I think of that you know with with even with my mom and dad and course all of us have that that trust we and many of us can talk about different testimony so let's just get on into the word and amen Colossians chapter 1 verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven amen may God bless you and bless the reading as word as you're being seated I want to continue to look at this thought we've been dealing with stages of reconciliation and primarily I've just want to continue the the part and the focus on it that if there is no death there is no resurrection and when we are looking at at this there has to be we we talk on we speak of the death and the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ but we recognize that that in this here it's his death that made a way that you and I might be able to die but what is resurrected in us is not the old life that dies but it's that life that we had with him before the foundation of the world so God is as all like when we were as we read all of this here in the book of Colossians this is all left up and in the hands of God it's all to the glory of Almighty God in bringing this to pass and we think back to the statement and this statement has just so resonated in my hearts I've shared it with you multiple times but them said it like this and God hiding himself in simplicity says now he hid himself his self in the death of Christ but manifested himself in the resurrection if there had not been any death there would not have been any resurrection and remember as just like the Lord has really been pressing this in our hearts that his death could not be forced this death could not be that of where the Lamb was forced to die but the lamb had to be willing to give his life it wasn't enough even for the Lamb himself the Lamb to die of old age that that wouldn't have debt wouldn't have satisfied it but it had to be that of a lamb and had to be an innocent one it be one who was willing to give his life in ransom for you and I and we know what a ransom payment is a ransom is where that there is one one or many that are in bondage and that are being held but a ransom is that which is required or is needed in order to release that which is being held and and there's only one that could pay this price and that would be God Himself come down and become one of us and and that's what this is stating here in Colossians 1 and we we see that so clearly that the Lord Jesus himself is not a second person it's not someone separate but it's God come down and become one at one of us because if we look at the expanse upon creation there was no one who could die for us there were many as the scripture would say holy men of old but the men were not holy come on but what it was it was the Holy Ghost that moved upon those men they were set aside by God but yet none of them even if they themselves would have given their life and they did give their life in order that the prophecy would be expressed of the coming Redeemer but yet they themselves did not have what was needed in order to pay the price you see God has made a requirement and when God makes a requirement like this then Italy it puts us in a place to where there is nothing that can be done except God Himself step on the scene and that's what he said clear back there in Genesis 3 after the fall after the fall had taken place yet God steps on the scene and it promises the woman he says I will give he said I will give you a seed and God was making a promise of a coming Redeemer and he said and he said within that that there would be enmity and he says that this seed it would this seed would receive the bruise in its heel but yet it would bruise the head of the seed of the serpent so it was a promise that this promise of the Messiah in that head that means of a ruling power a ruling authority so if there's only one that can overthrow this rule within your life within my life and that is Christ Himself coming and paying the price that then he might work to bring you an eye unto himself so to think of it that the Holy Spirit would move upon the profits move upon many of them and the Holy Spirit would take them they would be used of God they would they would act out their lives whether spoken out prophecy here or their lives just acted out in prophecy God Himself it was all declaring of one event and that was the coming of the Messiah and pointing to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit which was there the Ministry of the receiving of that sacrifice now coming back upon the worshiper so within this to remember as we were looking at this that he had become he became obedient unto death the death of the Cross and as we were looking at this that many many times that what is focused on is just the cross but remember before he ever died there on the cross there already was a death that take place before that ever manifested there there had to be something within that would take place there was a death dying completely to self and once you think of this the Lord Jesus he here he was he come down walked among us he was not of a sinful nature he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh but his nature was a lamb nature want you to think of this his nature was a lamb nature from the beginning you and I when we came into this world here we have a nature that is against God but underneath there is a lamb nature so there's no one that could take care of this first nature this old meant nothing could do away with this but there was one who could come to stand in our stead in order that we might come back to God he had to die to his own will you see it could not have been anything for stiii I know that simple but I want you to think of this because this is not something that he could be made to do but there was a conference that was called in Gethsemane and there was all that was gathered around and and like we said last week was Samson where Samson stood there in the midst of that time and he's led between those two pillars there was all sorts of the Philistines gathered all around and in the midst of the temple of their God and no wonder Jesus could say it's now that the prince of this world shall be judged he was declaring I'm getting ready to go to what is supporting this all and and I'm getting ready to reconcile all things I'm getting I'm going there to make a payment and you know there was Philistines all around but there in the Garden of Gethsemane there was every demon that was gathered or every demon that had ever bothered men the demon of lust and all of these other demons that were all around and they were there and and the pressure was on and here was a conference that was being held three times he prays if it's possible let this cup pass from me he knew there was nobody else could take that cup but he asked if it's possible let it pass from me and then we find it here three times it takes place what what is it that we're seeing here we're seeing the lamb die we're seeing the lamb being surrendering his life surrendering his rights you know he had a to live he got a right to a wife he had a right to home he had all of these rights yes sir but he forfeited those rights his life listened as a lamb his life was a life of forfeiture of his own will for the will of the Father you didn't listen now you didn't get easier but with the magnitude of the purpose for his coming on earth it didn't get easier it grew harder but yet listen what he was ordained and purposed to do he was predestinated for that and I want you to watch this predestination it wasn't just by pushing in the pipe and pulling him through the pipe but the lamb was free to make his own choice you with me that's overcoming here is where the lamb overcame in the Garden of Gethsemane it's where that he surrendered his will and let go of his will that he might be obedient to the Father's will it wants you to watch how Paul places this here let's just start in this just a little bit this morning in cautions 121 going on Paul says it like this he says and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled what's your watch out Paul is dealing and you who were enemies in your mind by wicked works he's not talking about this matter appear the mind it says this isn't the scriptures times were in the scripture the mind is speaking truly of our thoughts but this mind it's speaking of that nature our soul we were alienated and we could not come into the presence of God do you realize Gentiles could not come into the presence of God even when they took city baron jericho grab and her family could not come directly into israel the had to be a marriage there had to be a union that would bring her into Israel there was even against the Moabites God spoke concerning them all bites and what had taken place there with Moab you you recall perhaps the story and God here even when he sins Israel to go forth and they're gonna smite more Moab but I want you to notice they didn't white Moab out because why there was a seed that was going to come out of there she though in her flesh would be known as ruth the moabite us why that was for you and me but down beneath there there was a seed there was a nature that God Himself was coming for and she was in the lineage and genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ declared there in the mind of God but here upon earth she declares her position in his mind in his word is that how did that declare that because she accepted the light and walked in it and when she did that she declared I was there in his mind so how God would place these things we were alienated and we were enemies you mean we could set read the word listen to the message no and yet be enemies yes alienated because listen friends it took it took one to come and be able to bring you and I back to God there's only one thing that will keep you and I that will keep a person separated it's that first nature woo glory be to God alienated not able to come into the blessing and the notice he it we could not get there we couldn't do this but he came God came down and he spanned the breach here Mina he spanned the breach there was a chasm between God and man and there had to be one that could fill that space and be able to put his hand on man and a holy God there had to be one that would span that breach for you and I God came down the think of this here God becoming one of us in verse 22 in the body of his flesh this is how he had reconciled in the body of his flesh through death the disciples were walking with him but they hadn't been reconciled the payment hadn't even been made for them to be reconciled you see he had to he had to die there had to be a death there had to be an offering there had to be an atonement a perpetuation given through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh provable in his sight so who is the you that he recited that he reconciled who is the you that he's presenting holy unblameable Unruh provable in his sight that you is the real you that Lamb nature that was hidden beneath that first nature Christ did not come to make the first nature - to dress this guy up where you list me now he didn't come where there was a bottle that was torn and and he's going to put a nice patch on that bottle if he would put that patch on the bottle it takes away the rip takes away you can't put new wine into old bottles see the Ministry of the Lord Jesus is declaring this there has to be a new birth glory be to God now look at this verse 23 if you continue in the faith grounded and saddled and be not moved away from the hope the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Paul am made a minister so there there must be a continuance in what he has done the way that he has opened the Bible look at this the Bible says and when he Jesus come he said I am the way the truth and the life so there is a way now where we were alienated and closed off but now the way has been opened up and just stay out and just look at the way and say Maya thank God for the way you must have come in the way you must move in the way Strait is the gate right Str AIT it's a water gate strait is the gate you repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ your sacrifice come on somebody it don't do it's not good enough just to look at the way you must enter in you gotta enter in you got to continue in the notice can continuing in the faith remember when there were those who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and remember what he said to them he says if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed there's a continuances there's no stopping you must walk on in the way mine let's just move on Hebrews 2:17 wherefore in all things it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now keep to keep that in mind when he came and remember coming up on the River Jordan the Dove is descending down but the death will not unite with a wolf I want you to keep that we've been working that working that the Dove will not unite with the wolf the Dove does not drive the wolf away right it has to be to where that the Dove will unite with the lamb now they think about were you an hour out here you and I in a place walking around with the wolf's nature there is nothing that could be done to bring us to a place of lamb to where that lamb nature is underneath but there's nothing that could have told that could even then bring us to a place to where that we can become a lamb in order for him to unite with us there right because he will unite he unites with himself is that true he unites with himself the word unites with the word right the Holy Spirit unites with the word upon whom they'll see the spirit descending and remaining the same as he glory be to God aren't you thankful aren't you glad that you don't have to live an up-and-down life you don't have to live an in and out lies you can be grounded and settled amen you can be established in Christ he Ephesians chapter 2 verse 14 for he oh my he is our peace who hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us a place to where that only the high priest could enter in to that Tabernacle once a year speaking of Christ he would enter in once with his own blood but notice there was a separation we were alienated but there had to be a reconciling notice before Calvary before there could ever be a Calvary as we said it couldn't just be a holy man or profit or whatever more there was no one that was worthy it had to be one of like nature so God himself provided a body of blood cell it's God providing a body for himself to come down and there at the River Jordan was a reconciling God was reconciled back to man the Lord Jesus himself was the representation of all of the sons and daughters that were already here upon the earth and those that would be upon the earth he was the representation of that that coming of the Lord was a representation of when the Holy Spirit itself would come up on the believer because the Holy Ghost will come and claim its sons and daughters there had to be a reconciling so there had to be this reconciling first and he had broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity he abolished in his flesh the enmity the war the strife all that was there that first birth your first birth my first birth is enmity against God that first birth is a product between Satan and Eve it is a product not of the perfect will of God but the permissive will of God because God is life is that right God is not death there is no death in him he's light he is life but suddenly we look at this he abolished in his flesh so it had to come in such a manner to where God himself as we read in an earlier verse he he came and became one of us oh my how I think God for that he became one of us he had to in order to abolish the enmity even the law of commandments it's contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace this is this is the privilege this is now by redemption to where God now steps forward and we hear the declaration these two are now one hallelujah bowling my bone flesh of my flesh life of his life no longer to you see it's in our Christian is not one living two separate lives no cell not two separate life it is a life that has identified in Christ it's where Christ Himself has taken us unto himself and don't you we see it's not us receiving him it's him bringing us to the place to where he receives us we cannot make ourselves receivable the same you only have to repent we do but who is it the leads us to repentance the goodness of God leadeth or to repentance who is it that st. defines us his blood the right we have access to that who is that then moves upon a life who is it that's drawing us it's him it's not us coming to a place of receiving him it's him receiving us the wonder brother Brown was saying earlier I met part of the message and then in future home don't say he said you should not say I received the Holy Ghost he said you should say the Holy Ghost has received me glory be to God we were all guilty who think of this God Himself came down born of a woman he took his own laws upon himself and lived by those laws he didn't destroy the law come on they thought he was doing away with the law they thought he was against the law he wasn't this was the fulfillment of the law this was where the same God who gave the law the law giver himself was now dwelling there and giving an understanding of what the law was really all about here he was he took his own laws you know what you know in the Lord Jesus if you just take time and study this I don't have time to dwell on it but there's so much in the scripture to look at that statement we took his own laws on himself and live by he lived by what he said he lived by the word he just didn't give you another word and tell us a new commandment I write unto you that you would love one another even as I love you he just didn't give us these things he just did not look back at Commandments and and tell us to forgive one another he himself manifested his own law clear to the very part of even where the life left his body he took his own laws and he lived by them he came he himself came down that he might redeem you and I who were under the curse of the law he who was innocent the innocent one came down oh ma I think of how Paul says it like this he said he didn't do a way with the law but now the law is established the law is established he didn't do away with it but now that law is established because now in the hearts of the believer those that have been born of the Spirit of God that law remember the law those tablets were in the ark and the ark was taken into the presence of God and there there was the cherubims the anointing and the Shekinah glory that word itself it finds its mark in the lives of the believer and therefore Paul could say that we find the Gentiles that they do by nature those things that are written in the law knew by nature we couldn't have done it under our first nature there has to be another nature that is pression that God raises up one that is dead that he must raise up the head life before glory be to God that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nine oh my the purpose that we might be reconciled in that one body he made a way he made a way that you and I might be able to die let's say brother Samuel I ain't even made plans for my funeral I'm not talking about your natural body I'm talking about your soul I'm talking about that first nature that old man he made a way that that and first nature could die Lord would be to God it couldn't do it before there wasn't anything there wasn't released by access what was needed in order to break down that first nature you take a seed you put a sea now and well we've got a lot of rain out here it's a good time if you planted grass or planted some landscaping and things like that is a good time and we got rain coming to rest this week but if you take a seed and you put that seed in dirt you don't water it it'll still lay there a seed well I'm waiting on tomato plants if water don't get to it it'll lay there but the water must first get to it because that water will break it down I don't care how much Sun is on it if water don't get to it water finds its way through the earth come on now you don't got to bring the seed up to the surface and water it the seed is there buried in the earth and the water will find the seed and the seed catches like joe said the scent of water hallelujah and what does the water do begin the process of rot but the germ that's there on the inside can come forth hollow he has abolished in his flesh he hath made a way that you and I who were playing now we might become one he made a way are you with me the brat does not enter the bride does not enter in here first to be married it is the groom who enters in here first because the groom is the initiator of the Covenant it's his name she's receiving she is receiving she has received of his advances where he has had you know and been courting her reached out to her she has responded to that come on somebody they hit do the back don't come here and stand here and say well you know I don't I don't know how I don't know I mean you know hey hold on me preacher hold on it's like what you say your 401k was okay I think that's all right um let me see am I gonna be able to have my own car - okay well have my own checking account how much your god I would just stand up and say everybody dismissed because this is going to be a failure how you can you say that cuz it's all about one side whoa you can't enter into the union when it's about self neither listen to me now neither even when it comes to the natural union neither is it the groom looking at it in the manner and say well you know she's so sorry I'm gonna help her out I'm gonna lift her up you know I mean look at her I mean she you know Carly can't even match her clothes right and I I'm gonna help her out here I'm gonna no sir that's wrong he made himself of no reputation he that he couldn't he could not he doesn't come here and unite you and I with pride in the beginning the first Union came by pride when Satan here through the vehicle of a serpent he began to present to eat yeah God's errand and you know you you shall be as God's when you you were partake of this what's he doing elevating her pride that Union produced a king here with me he produced the Cain and because of that where each and every one of us come into this world we are as the Bible says in Psalms 51 born in sin shaped in iniquity job said and Joe 14 ugly verse 5 he said Who how can an unclean bring forth clean but you see here the bridegroom himself stepping forward how did he himself the Bible says in first Peter 3:18 for Christ also had suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit and Isaiah 63 verse 1 oh my I love this here has a ax picked up here it is utter doubt who is this that cometh from Edom with dyed garments from Bullock Bossier this that is glorious and here's a pair of peril traveling in the greatness of history that were traveling means that the scowl he has stooped and convinced indeed I that speak in righteousness mighty to save this is who it is I that speak in righteousness and mighty to save wherefore art thou read Adama wherefore off out read in dine apparel he became one of us wherefore art thou tread in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine fat notice the detail the detail is caught here is one like you and I may like unto his brethren made in the likeness of sinful flesh but yet he himself Lamb nature he never had to repent but notice now he goes and he's going to tread the winepress of God's wrath it's recognized he's one of us and his garments his garments his vesture what the devil scoffed at what calluses and the rest of him scoffed at it said if you're him come down off the cross save yourself but if he would have saved himself he couldn't have saved others or let that go deep let that go deep that life of Christ in you and me it does not make you selfish it makes you lose sight of yourself and we must be reminded of that we must be reminded of that and raised up within that notice I have trodden the winepress alone and of the people there was none with me think of this the Sun refused to shine no the moon would not give her light as her greater as quick even as he was there he cries out my God my God why hast thou forsaken me he cries out like a sinner he didn't say my father my father why has thou forsaken me my God my God because he could not remain a son and make you and I who were sinners sons but he became sin he died he died not as a son he died as a sinner spilled into lay still was a lamb nature he poured out his soul as an offering for death there was no soul that was upon the earth none could do this but while the rest of them every said for weeks the rest of them were scoffing and they were looking at what was taking place on Calvary but God was looking down and said he shall see the travail of his soul and be satisfied listen now it wasn't the anguish of all that could come out here it was not it was not that that just that position of his body it was the condition of his soul that God was looking at you understand what I'm saying God looks at the condition of our soul it doesn't matter friends how much we cry listen you understand I'm not taking away from that I just want you to see that God is looking there on the inside and God is dealing with the inside man I don't believe in Dryad repentance I just don't believe in it for the salmon you don't believe in it I don't know how you can I don't know how you can repent and not break you up I don't stand that oh I need scripture for that well I'm glad you asked us he just dropped the Bible said when Noah preached the message of repentance here is God giving an announcement but there is going to come a way of repentance this was only in time but notice the Bible says that when he had ministered that message The Fountains of the deep were broken up the deep that which was within it's a repentance not something that you come out of fear but it's where God has dealt with your heart God has dealt with your heart noticed this let's look at this here just a few moments he tread that winepress of the wrath of God alone I didn't put this up but just let me read it alone how do you must be born again alone he walked the road alone he died with not no help from an angel from a man from his church from his mother from his brethren from his father and forsaken by God man and nature he died alone to show us that even nature itself can't help us in the hour of death no one was there but I got great news he walked that way so you don't ever have to know loneliness you don't ever have to know this his promise and his word that he desires and makes real and desires to make real to your heart is I'll never leave you nor forsake you now the only way how this promise I'll never leave you nor forsake you it has to be a lamb nature that he can unite with and seal because when he's sealed you're sealed until the day of redemption notice this in numbers 21 here was a situation that arose within the camp there within that of the Israel here and remember the Bible says in numbers 21 7 the people came to know Moses and they said we've sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set it on a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten we need to look at the pond it shall live notice make thee a fiery Serpent he never said take one of the fiery serpents that's running around because one that was already here could not atone but there's got to be one made make thee a fiery Serpent why a serpent it's representing sin sin being judged make thee a fiery serpent don't reach on the ground and take one but make v1 whoo glory hallelujah and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it up on a pole that pole is called a standard a banner and in sign huko ever could see it look and live now right and it came to pass look at this it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived I want you to watch now there was a need among the people they had sinned but notice how that Moses steps in to intercede on their behalf what was that in Moses the Spirit of Christ he steps in and he intercedes and notice a word is revealed and then the word that is revealed becomes substance and when the word becomes substance that word becomes an atonement for the people hallelujah all the way down through the Old Testament what was written in the heavens all that all the way on down was a word that was ministered that was spoken that was speaking of a coming Redeemer and that word itself that word became all wrapped up in the person of Jesus Christ as our atonement but whosoever here is God as a prophet on the scene and there's a need that arises and the prophet catches the inspiration and the word drops in that kind and the people now are not just listening to a word but it is a word that is called in the manifestation and that word pacts within an atonement if pacts within it the ability to remove that poison that poison that would destroy them it would kill them but notice there was one who came down and there was going to be some anti-venom hello he came down and he got he took a shot he took an inoculation in this life that was lived in that body here in the body of his flesh he abolished the enmity there up he took the bite of sin he took that bite that thereby back the rest who were bitten by the first verse but now there is a toxin that's able to defeat that first birth a toxin that's able to take a care of that first nature girl repeat Oh God he came down and became bitten he took that sting of death in himself for you and me why that he might give his life to you and I even so as it goes on to say the Son of Man must be lifted up oh my brother Graham points it out like this he said notice in that serpent I want you to hang on to this he said notice in that serpent there was no life in that serpent that serpent was not on the pole it was not a serpent that was you know moving around on the pole you could look at and say ain't dead they dead but the serpent itself was made out of brass brother Graham puts her like this it was crystallized there was no movement there it was death what was that speaking of our death our death to the old man he's not just hung up to the occasion but he must become crystallized dead there's no moving around who Romans 5:6 for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly aren't you glad you me who were enemies in our minds by wicked works he died for the ungodly he was godly died for the ungodly he made us the unlovable lovable for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us you talking about love his confidence would look at this the Lord Jesus goes to Calvary where is his confidence his confidence is in what the word has said about him are you with me he endured the cross for the joy that was set before he went there wherein it all was so resonated within his heart destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up he knew there was coming a resurrection is that right but the place coming to that place right there notice the whole point come into that place John well now it's my soul troubled what shall I say save me from for this hour but for this hour for this cause I came into the world notice it's coming down it's coming down to the crowning of his ministry it's coming down the third pole is coming into a greater manifestation are you with me glory be to God there's got to be a dying off it seems like everything dies before he can raised it has to be within this manner here he himself while we were yet sinners can you die can I die for that person the road Ram says that it would kill you if they had the chance remember the revenue they don't that they own cow versus brother Ram I could live for this guy well he's a fine guy you know live for that person who I hate you can you do that me to say this right here your flesh can never do that your flesh will kick against that you can never reform yourself enough to do that but you have access to his life that can so move in you and cleanse you from the hurt and the sting that is there so that you walk in Liberty let me tell you something you holding against son something against somebody else you're not really affecting the other person you're causing yourself trouble bitterness is where you yourself it's like this right here you've got the bitterness and you're taking a drink and you're maybe I'm bitter at brother Joey ain't nothing happened man he's getting happier he's getting freer what is it who's actually getting killed me I'm the one drinking it it's coming up in me and yet I'm expected you see what I did listen friends these are things that the enemy he wants to so deceitfully what's he trying to do stifle out that life the death of the Lord Jesus made a way listen now that you and I could die and then through this death it makes a way that we can die daily huh constantly dying oh yes sir you love me Christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him through him for if when we were enemies my anybody liked being labeled an enemy no but Paul's letting us know we were enemies at one time but you really weren't an enemy just you were an enemy there's a part of you that was an enemy but there's a part of you that was always a part of God glory for it when we were enemies now watch this verse this is oh this is a big verse right here we were reconciled to God by the death of his son there was a payment made there was a payment made but he must come and claim what he paid the Holy Ghost comes forth to claim what he was paid and it lets you know you were included in the sacrifice glory be to God you love him much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his wife so even he the payment of his life was given that he might come and deal with you and I and bring us to himself in Redemption then the imparting of his life is when you've been fully reconciled unto him not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement said Corinthians 5:14 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead now wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait wait you're telling me I have to die but yet Paul just said all we're dead no there was a part of us that was alive but there was a part of us that was dead and the part that was dead he became dead that we might be alive he became dead he died that we might die the Horta be to God you see how look at this life the Lord Jesus himself here's the Lamb nature here he is he didn't have to repent there didn't have to be you know a change of nature no no he was always the lamb but notice he died he became as you and I were we were dead in sin and trespasses he died but then he rose again testified there's more in this field that's coming glory verse 15 and that he died for all that day which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto Him which died for them and rose again in that a privilege that's a privilege but we don't live for ourselves anymore our ambitions listen friends God is not interested in taking away your dreams or ambitions or other things just as long as that's not before his word it cannot be before his word or contradict his word if you want God if you really want the blessing of God you say does that mean I can't I can't you know fully do this or or Excel right here you can Excel if that's what God wants you to do in that line of work or that workplace or wherever it's at you can do that but it ought to me to such a place do you recognize that it's not about your skills it's not God coming to highlight your skills but you are a vessel to be used of the Lord a vessel where that life is to be reflected through it's no longer about you you see this is why the preaching of the word it continues to come to put us in that place that our sites do not become centered upon this earth remember where your site is is where you'll finish if your site is on things of this earth that's where you'll finish where is your site where is your goal where is your aim that matters Satan is very meticulous he knows how to sew intertwine and try to take our time and our lives and our thoughts this is why friends listen the ministering of the word glaucoma's write down and even when we have been born again of the Spirit of God we need the Holy Spirit coming down and putting you and I in remembrance of these things this is a love affair it's a love affair the message knoweth it not I'm trying to get somewhere the Bram says this he was the fullness of all of you you were in him back yonder at Calvary this is paragraph 182 he foreknew you would be here he only broadcast what would take place let me hold on second he foreknew let me ask you something you go to a pawn shop a pawn shop holds something that belongs to you are you with me you don't go to that pawn shop and lay down a hundred dollars and say I wonder what they're gonna give me you're with me you don't lay that down you go to the pawn shop because there's something that has been pawned of your own belonging to you and you go there with the necessary payment to get what belongs to you you with me the hundred dollars does not make the watch that had to be ponder the hundred dollars does not make it yours the hundred dollar says this is what was required to bring back to me that which was lost that's Redemption so the Lord Jesus Christ notice the lamb was slain revelations 13 before the foundation of the world he came down here not hoping that there would be people that would feel sorry for him he came into this world and he laid the necessary answer to claim what belonged to him even this earth he's claimed he baptized it in the days of Noah his blood has dripped upon it it's going to get a fire baptism leading in in the Millennium and then after that here we find that after that great volcanic then the very future home of Christ himself will set down upon this earth he's redeeming the earth the same way that he's redeemed you and I you say well look at their hurt look at look at what's going on and you say he's redeemed the world know the earth earth and world are two different things this world he is not of this world so what he said I'm not of this world there's got to be a change of administration there's got to be a change of administration in this earth and his he has made a way that there could be a final change of administration to where it even speaks in the Millennium in the Book of Revelations that the kingdoms of this earth have become the kingdoms of our Lord and His Christ his sons and daughters of God he's anointed him glory be to God set out they're in the Millennium Oh blessed be his name you love him he's made away for this he made away for this he only look at this I got to read this part again he foreknew you would be here he only broadcast what would take place you don't know what a broadcast is it's a telling fourth of what's going to take place his life was a declaration this is what's going to take place there's going to be others that come and they die to themselves this is an announcement that is going forth Calgary was an announcement while the devil and the rest of them and all the scoffers were there but yet on Calvary there was prophecy ringing out as his life was being given he said I've got more brethren glory and you were in him you died with him you died to your prize you say how could I have died I wasn't even alive then if you are a seed of God he was all of the word every word he was the fullness it pleased the father in him should all the fullness dwell he was the fullness of the word in what we could look there at Calvary we would see the book of life amen the Lamb who was there we would see every son and daughter of God he's identified in that sacrifice I want you to watch this here as he says this he says you guide to your pride you died to your fashions you died to the world you died with him at Calvary don't you see he made a way that you and I could die we couldn't die before the rich young ruler he came to the Lord Jesus good master what must I do to have eternal life and the Lord Jesus looking upon him he loved him he said thou knowest go keep the commandments he said I have from my youth up if that man was lying he'd have been called out on it but it's sho just keeping the commandments that's not redemption I'm gonna say it tight just being around this message is not redemption just being able to quote it just being able to sit around it it's not Redemption there's got to be a death the real reality this message leads you this is God's life leading you tonight to a death what must I do go sell what thou hast see what he touched the Spirit of God got down and touched what he valued now Vita told him go sell that that car that's old rusty and whatever more go sell that no problem y'all met you only donate it I'll donate a Salvation Army Lord I mean they might I call I'll call a record cuz it don't work anyhow I'll be glad to give that that's not what he wanted go sell all thou hast and give to the poor Oh Lord you want me to start a charity organization oh and make fruit baskets for people that's so you want me to take all of my money and give all of my money to make baskets for people and now God don't want his money he didn't want his money he wanted his life but you see his life was intertwined with his substance his substance was his life his substance though he walked under the commandments but his substance was his God come on he gave oblations to it Oh Lord a mercy listen how can you say this look look in the midst of the time instead of surrendering and dying he walks away if his heart he's discouraged grieved because he had many possessions but remember your possessions no matter how great they are no matter how much they are can never bring you peace and will never be there to comfort you in the hour of your dad's death you are not redeemed by silver and gold but redeemed by the precious blood of the Lamb hallelujah dying there notice all he says he rose again on that third day and because you've accepted it now you are sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus all he said there you are it's that inside man that inside that will punctuate the word and hang with the word regardless you can't help it all the brothers and I Oh what did what I is that but brother Samuel I know the word what I is that is that the first nature or is that a new nature the first nature can quote the word real good the first nature can be a great worker who know when that life has been quickened you can't help it no Samuel he's not gonna push me through a pipe and pull him out I know I'm glad you remember that quote from the first part of the service that's exactly right but what is within you is made in contact with him and it's able to be touched and able to be drawn and when the Prophet stood right there in the midst of that time and when the enemy came right up against him came right in his mind rattled his spiritual cage his reasoning he said everything he was saying at that time was the truth and I was about ready to say if that's the way he's going to be but he said Oh think if that new birth hadn't been there if that Holy Ghost had not been there that tight Aust see where he gave credit he didn't give credit to any stalker well I got this from the branham's I'll tell you were real strong people were resolute no branham's would have caved come on you put your last name in there too this is not about the stocks of your genealogy no sir this is about him him lifting up his own jeans glory dude Oh God you love him here he is in his life nah I don't know where time goes to let me let me let me close on this in the message on the wings of a snow white dove brother bream has just mentioned here right before this quote brother Lyle had asked him a question said brother Branham I guess the messages like lamb and a dove you don't you don't get to them the kind of messages anymore he said with what you've got but the bream says if I get away from that I've missed my message see that was only prophetic when he spoke the lamb and the dove notice how the Spirit of God was calling out to the people to be a lamb why because the word that was going to be coming born into existence could not unite with off it had to unite with the lamb remember the declaration of the messenger the Prophet said this messenger will be pointing the people to a word born bride and he will point them to the of the Simon I said how beautiful it's typed here is Jesus being the Lamb and God being the dove and the Dove would not have settled on a wolf his nature is not right it couldn't have settled on a dog his nature's not right it had to be on a lamb the two nature's had to be the same and that's the way we have to be our natures has to change from the roaring sinner to the meekness of a lamb our natures has to change or how could we ever get there how could we ever get to a place to where that our natures could come into a place that he could actually unite with us he's the way he's the way he showed look cry back here in the time of Noah he showed he told Noah he said Noah when he revealed to him an ark make an ark for the saving of you and your household Noah was instructed there was a pattern that was given how that the ark itself would have three floors to it there's three works of grace but within that there was one tree that was cut down one type of a tree cut down and the life was taken out of that tree the ark itself would be formed out of this other tree but this other tree would have to come to a place to where it could absorb the life from this other tree so this tree had to die to give its life these trees had to die surrendering their life that this life might seal these trees because as he said thou shalt pitch it in that word pitch the first time the word atonement is used in the scriptures if our that shall make a pitch the atonement his wife coming to you and I is the atonement the at1 meant no longer Twain but one I told that look how Jesus says this can I have just a few more moments I mean I'm winding this down I'm not gonna be with you next week ends I want to I want to get this in here in Matthew 16:24 Jesus says if any man will come after me come after me he's not talking about just following just like in earthly footsteps but this word come means to move from one place to another in order to come after him they have to be a part of him and be invited and then he brings us into fellowship that we might come after him let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me how many of you know that Jesus spoke more of our cross than he did his he spoke a lot more of our cross than he did his cross deny who himself so that's where it starts he didn't say take up his cross and then deny himself no same order he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so denying self this had to be a death and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it so he said if you want to keep your life you can keep it but you'll lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it he's the example he lost his life but he gained it and nothing he just gained life look what he gained for what his profit was a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul they say this is where it comes down to that place Satan and all cost desires to prevent death I said what what you mean he I thought Satan was taken was you know out here and trying to take people's lives and you know I'm talking about spiritual from where that we die to ourselves because Satan knows when death comes his power ends and death his rule his Dominion ends there that is why Satan will offer substitutes that's why he'll offer substitutes to people such as all you gotta do is believe that's it it is belief believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and then quote the Scriptures but remember if you're still squirming as a serpent you haven't died yet this has made possible that we might die just become a part of our church become a part of our assembly listen friends we bring it right down here we can't keep this out here oh all you got to do is is believe the message all you gotta do is believe God sent a prophet it's deeper than that don't you let people misplace words on you when people go to saying and they say well the message is the token how are you saying that how are you saying that because the Prophet never bypassed nor did he do away with the baptism of the holy ghost but the true message is the message of Jesus Christ and His righteousness so if you're going to say that the message and you're saying that is a token if your tie that together and letting it be that it's Christ the Holy Ghost in you I can see men but just to know this message is not life just to be around it is not life come on now this is where the water is flowing unless you're positioned in it right as a tree of righteousness if you're just laying in it you'll rot you've got to be positioned in it to draw that life into yourself it's more than just an association it's more than if this is it's got to be a life that's on display life that goes it's beyond this church is beyond when we're here in kinds of service it's a life that goes with you everyday it shows itself in the workplace on the job everywhere you go but Satan wants to prevent death or if he can stop it you're trying to get things upon people's minds all get to looking forward to this and get to looking forward to that remember there's one thing there's one thing don't miss it don't miss it don't miss the rapture don't miss the climax of his coming don't miss being a part of the body of Jesus Christ listen I'm not just talking about well I'm not you you and brother sent me here you're talking like I need to get ready to die you're not fit to live till you're ready to die you're not you're not getting ready to die you're getting ready to live you love you now closing there's two altars here's the gate the East of Eden process of time here comes Kane here comes Abel they're coming to worship Kane comes up he offers fruit beautiful fruit beautiful he came to worship he had a church Kane was humble here comes Abel and here is Abel coming to worship but Abel doesn't have fruit he has a lamb so one has a sound one does it have a sound here's two alters and Cain comes and lays himself upon the altar and once you listen this now Cain comes and lays himself upon the altar and begins to worship God and as he's laying upon his altar God rejects it he's brought fruit that he toiled and he brought the best fruit and he is laying on the altar and God refuses it why his sacrifice had no sound there was no sound of death in his sacrifice but here comes Abel here comes the lamb Abel prepares the lamb here it is laid upon the altar evil takes that jagged rock or the brown would describe it he cuts that throat and he lays that lamb upon the altar and God hears he hears the sound of death hears the sound of death God said what I revealed what I revealed now it's substance and Abel is offering this enable himself he climbs upon the altar with his land and God receives Abel with his sacrifice because Abel's sacrifice God heard the death rattle this one God didn't hear any death this one it looked wonderful it looked just right he was pressed prostrate everything was just right you know brother bran dramatizes no doubt it Cain he cried and he worshiped and he he was able Abel's crying Abel's worshiping but then remember Abel himself because of his sacrifice label Abel dies on the same altar he's received with his sacrifice so what is it it's death he has made a way that you can die to yourself because in order to be born again you first have to die and that's the same listen that's the same way in every part of our life it's dying to self this age this age the epitome of this age the Bible describes in first Timothy four men shall be lovers of them own selves do away with drywall just put mirrors all over their house lovers of themselves but I ask you are you willing to lose sight of yourself allow and be died to yourself that he might be born in you are you willing to relinquish you said by the same knife I've already come to this place oh oh I remember a lamb well if it's a lamb nature that's been raised up it's still self-sacrificing it doesn't draw to a place that oh no no it's self-sacrificing it's going all the way this is part of reconciliation but you see it's a part that Satan doesn't want nobody to know about you don't want you don't want people to know about death because without death he still has power no matter how knowledgeable of the word it can be he still has power but when death has come he sets down there in your life then you have greater is He that is in you then he that's in the world you now have authority and you take possession of this vessel it's not your inheritance but it's your possession and when this vessel wants to pull back the inside man copes with the word the inside man says Lord be it unto me be it unto me be it unto me dying to ourselves aren't you glad he made a way aren't you listen friends he makes a way and he has made a way and he continues to manifest that way to you and I that we might continue to die to ourselves I don't know about you sometimes I just get lost in prayer just rejoicing God thank you that a heart can be clean heart can be free you understand or something that maybe has been done wrong or more thank God thank you you might say brother say man that sounds juvenile I don't think so I don't think so I think God for that because I know there's not a gene inside the Browning's that could overcome that but it has to be a prevailing of the gene of God on the inside and let me say you can't help it it shall prevail so you look around you say I still see all my mistakes I still see weaknesses but you know the desire of your heart and your life has been changed and when that has been changed those are grounds that you stand on that that devil cannot put his feet on and you stand on those grounds remember what when Moses stood on those grounds remember how the Prophet takes us back to those sacred sands you stand upon those grounds you've got a place to stand where Satan can never put his dirty feet it's a place he can never and from that place you you the real you you have to be reconciled there will you has been given authority to stand up to stand up and to live not unto yourself but unto Him what what what love is this he made away for you and I well we were yet sinners yet he said there's some lambs here there's lambs this road in the Lamb's Book of Life and the Lamb of God came to redeem the Lambs of God I give myself away lord I give myself away willingly not made to you see it's not made to by mom and dad or no I give myself to you you let him draw you you let him draw you let him work let him move within your life listen friends don't live your life under pressure but what you see from others you yield to the Lord as the Lord is dealing with you you don't want to impersonate anything this is between you and him you yield to him and you let him draw you and do the full work in your life let him just submit to him you don't have to make it happen even of things that he's dealing with in your life and it's dealt with your life in this service and your weaknesses stand up before you your shortcomings but remember let him draw you and say Lord within me is that same life I believe that Lord and that same life there was not anything that could keep that life buried it could not keep it in the grave it lost its hold how did that happen by submission just submit and Lee lay before him oh my I love you I love you in the Lord what a privilege it is to be a partaker of his life that's what this is kind that's what this is here this is why we come to the services that we and ourselves might draw strength from him so I do that III do that every day you should you should but here God comes down and he speaks to you and I and he'll call that flesh you'll call it in line and that inner man says that's the truth and flesh will say Oh get up quick go to the bathroom right now quick but the inner man says sit down I brought you here I brought you here sit down you remember the older brother says what's all this commotion the younger brother says I've been redeemed I've been redeemed let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father I pray Lord here this morning I know Lord your word it Lord God you don't miss the mark Lord you know you know Lord what you're you're aiming for you know Lord the thought that you would bring to our hearts and you know our needs within that it's not about it's not about you bringing a thought and us listening and trying to absorb it and trying Lord to come to a place to where that we can explain it that that's not what it's about Lord you lead us Lord you draw us and father this is this is our desire Lord father to know that the word that has you've spoken what God may it resonate within our hearts Lord may it resonate so deeply Lord in our lives oh god I pray Heavenly Father lord what an otter privilege what you have bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God Lord you made a way that that that first nature there could be a death to ourselves [Music] then Lord we might be born again it can be born again that the first nature is still alive or the desires of the world well God even Lord as it's a cleansing Lord within that but father your desire is that your life that fire to where every every desire of the world is so burn out of our lives and where you take residence smart in our lives to where the very declaration Lord of our life is Christ who is our life nor Jesus some things Lord this morning or no doubt said pretty straight but father you know my heart in this age this is an age of such callousness an age Lord where the enemy Lord such deception father my heart's desire Lord I don't want no one to miss this life I don't want anyone what goddess Noah could stand there on the ark and preach he preached as though it was to everybody and I believed all that that's exactly how that you declare your word it's broadcast to all the Lord God there's there's elected seed there's children and when that word is broadcast that live it makes its way the Lord begins to move down beneath it begins to deal with that seed that life that's hidden down there on the inside oh god I pray Lord this is the desire Lord it's your desire what you you place that desire Lord in our hearts Lord and that would be your God that your life would be preeminence in our lives Lord that's my desire Lord father for every every brother and sister for each one Lord would come here Lord and and they would make this Lord God their home church they would look to me Lord as their pastor or God how would fail them Lord if I didn't point them Lord God in the right way to you Lord Lord Jesus this is not a Lodge we're not brought in by membership it's not in by association Oh God there is that spiritual body the body of Jesus Christ it's by one spirit were baptized into that body what God it's your life that it calls out it's just like when that atonement was made in the time of Jubilee there was a priest that would go out and ride throughout the land and he would blow he would blow and announce that the sacrifice has been accepted he would announce this is the year of Jubilee that announcement that went forth it was a sounding of the blood sounding of the life and each one Lord that held within him an instrument a tool habits they could throw that down and say I can go back to my inheritance I don't have to stay a slave and serve sin any longer Oh God granite may that sound rise within the hearts Lord may it rise in certainty Lord God Lord Jesus I pray Lord God for many many of us Lord we've come to that place a fellowship in you Lord to be born again we're the token life itself has laid claim on our lives and we are identified with our sacrifice and yet Lord we want to die more to ourselves Lord this that I pack around with me under the name of Samuel browning he gets in my way things the Lord it can be a feelings thoughts so many different things but what they're spending equiping on the inside that equipping isn't for me to manhandle the sky but it's to submit to the inner man for as you said to us through your word for if you do mortify the deeds of the body through the spirit you shall live or God I pray throughout this congregation those that's visible those Lord and the invisible audience Lord streaming or archived this later god I pray Lord for those especially Lord there would be a part of this assembly I pray for all but Lord God I'm not pastor to everybody I'm not everybody's pastor the father for this word God may it reach into the depths of our lives Lord Jesus I pray for each and every one what God may we Lord Jesus died more to ourselves Lord may it be a greater loosening of ourselves may it not be Lord not more of our natural genes showing up but know that spiritual gene declaring itself granite Lord we yield Lord will yield help us to yield more Lord teach us Lord God Lord Jesus in your hands Lord that we would yield ourselves or Jesus such complete trust Lord in order to know you're the performer of your word in us help assuage granite in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you if you like to stand this is your hands this is your hands this is your oh this is your
