[34:33] the masks i've noticed that some of the
[34:36] time when i wasn't ministering
[34:38] and i was able to see as i've come in
[34:41] come back through here
[34:42] how you've been coming in in that manner
[34:45] if you haven't i would ask that you
[34:47] would
[34:48] um i want but i want to say thank you
[34:50] and i just
[34:51] the the things that we we know uh
[34:54] with this one thing about this with this
[34:56] virus
[34:57] and um i don't like talking about it no
[35:00] more than you do
[35:02] but ignoring it doesn't make it make it
[35:03] go away
[35:05] and ignoring it isn't faith ignoring it
[35:08] is wishful thinking but we realize that
[35:11] for all of us the inconveniences and
[35:13] everything that it
[35:14] has been all around us uh everywhere you
[35:17] go and
[35:18] so forth but i i personally believe that
[35:21] as we've looked more at this
[35:23] and you see certain sometimes positions
[35:25] and this is my right and this is this
[35:27] and this is that
[35:28] i really wonder is god permitted all of
[35:31] this
[35:32] to really test and see is our character
[35:35] really got all the greenness out because
[35:38] it doesn't mean that we go along with
[35:39] everything because we always agree with
[35:41] it or see it
[35:42] but as the scripture said give unto
[35:44] caesar
[35:46] that which is caesar's and this is
[35:48] certainly not an infringement upon our
[35:50] religious
[35:50] liberties and uh things like this
[35:53] inconvenience oh yes i
[35:54] i mean i think about when i had to it
[35:57] was in a doctor's
[35:58] office with one of our sons the one day
[36:00] and my had to wear the mask you know as
[36:02] you're in there
[36:03] the whole time and usually with the
[36:05] store you know you're in and out with
[36:07] the store real quick i just
[36:09] whether it's mask or no mask i'm kind of
[36:10] a purpose guy
[36:12] i'm like on the swat team when i go into
[36:13] the store to shop i'm not there just to
[36:15] window browse you know
[36:17] even if i'm going to look at a tie go to
[36:20] the clearance rack nothing on clearance
[36:21] rack leave
[36:22] i mean it's just i'm done you know so um
[36:26] but i remember you know we were sitting
[36:27] there and i we you know sometimes you
[36:29] have to sit for a longer time and
[36:31] and i just remember that that particular
[36:33] day when uh
[36:34] you know after i come out of there and i
[36:36] come home and i know some of you as
[36:38] medical professionals and
[36:40] i know i know our middle son benjamin he
[36:42] has to wear it the whole time when he's
[36:44] at work with food
[36:45] when i came out of there my goodness i
[36:47] felt so you know i just seemed like i
[36:49] couldn't get my bearings back through
[36:51] the rest of the day and
[36:53] uh but you know we i just want to say
[36:56] thank you for
[36:57] for doing that thank you for through the
[36:59] time just you know
[37:01] letting everything you know our
[37:03] differences and feelings just i'm just
[37:05] thankful to god just that we can lay all
[37:07] that aside
[37:08] because satan doesn't matter he doesn't
[37:11] care what he
[37:13] can do or what he can use he'll use
[37:15] something that is so insignificant
[37:17] to try to bring division and these are
[37:20] things in this hour i believe that the
[37:22] word that god has sent to you and i it's
[37:25] to sharpen
[37:26] our discernment it's to catch him as
[37:28] brother branham would put it
[37:30] recognize the devil at every one of his
[37:32] tricks
[37:33] so i i want to say thank you for those
[37:36] as you're
[37:37] coming in and i just want to encourage
[37:40] you if you haven't been please do that
[37:42] uh and while after dismissal and then
[37:44] when we're out here
[37:46] these are things that the deacons even
[37:47] had brought to my attention
[37:49] even while we're out here uh you know
[37:52] trying to social the distance or
[37:54] whatever we're doing
[37:56] all of this and trusting lord because of
[37:58] all the sanitation that goes into this
[38:00] building after a service
[38:02] you're not going to get every germ
[38:05] that's why with everything we do we
[38:07] trust the lord
[38:09] and so um you know i just i i believe
[38:13] with all my heart
[38:14] we can just just say lord just just help
[38:17] me just leave me
[38:18] i know there's been different ones um
[38:21] and
[38:21] and i certainly don't want anything to
[38:23] be a lacks or carelessness on our part
[38:26] uh with anything it would you know uh so
[38:29] we just
[38:29] we want to do the best we can i
[38:31] understand you do everything you can
[38:33] and it's like with everything we've seen
[38:36] our president last week and
[38:37] where he was at with everything i mean
[38:39] if that was the tightest probably you
[38:41] could get
[38:42] there's other brothers pastors that's
[38:44] come down with it they don't have any
[38:45] idea
[38:46] how in the world did they come down with
[38:47] it because they followed everything
[38:50] um but yet that's what we want to do all
[38:52] that we can do but we trust the lord
[38:55] and so i know i'm just thankful
[38:58] that god has allowed us we've not had
[39:00] any interruption
[39:01] and i was that right there goes not to
[39:05] myself or to the deacons
[39:07] i think you for following uh the
[39:09] guidance and for the direction
[39:12] uh that's been been given because
[39:15] we just our objective we
[39:18] i want to be in the house of god i i
[39:21] mean i i wouldn't care if they said
[39:23] you got to wear a brown paper bag and
[39:25] preach through it i don't care
[39:27] i want to be in the house of god i'm not
[39:30] going to let that
[39:33] get my attitude in a wrong way well i
[39:35] tell you bless
[39:37] this is why we just want to give we want
[39:41] to give
[39:41] place and just say lord i'm this is the
[39:44] purpose i'm not going to be sidetracked
[39:46] i'm going to stay with a focus and an
[39:49] attraction
[39:50] on you and that's what that's our that's
[39:52] our objective here we
[39:54] just want to try to do that so i'm just
[39:56] asking why as you enter the building
[39:59] when you exit the sanctuary and then
[40:01] exit the building please
[40:02] uh have your mask on and then when you
[40:06] get outside then you know you can
[40:08] take it off i guess if you're not going
[40:09] to socially distance but
[40:12] don't don't come up to somebody to me or
[40:14] anybody else
[40:16] and uh without even if you've got a mass
[40:18] don't try to see how many cavities i've
[40:20] had
[40:22] personal space
[40:28] i love you
[40:31] brother samuel we ought to be able to
[40:32] chew one another's bubble gum
[40:34] it's got to be the right flavor and i'm
[40:36] the first guy to chew it
[40:40] let's say ain't what the quote says then
[40:42] you pray for god to help me
[40:44] grow to that place
[40:48] amen well we just love the lord
[40:52] let's just turn our hearts right now to
[40:54] the
[40:55] to the word as we would look into the
[40:57] word if you'll stand with me i want to
[40:58] go to romans chapter 8.
[41:18] so
[41:25] okay
[41:31] uh romans 8 verse 1. let's just read a
[41:34] few verses of scripture here
[41:37] and to and this morning what i want to
[41:39] deal with the thought that we want to
[41:41] look at
[41:42] in opening in this in this chapter um
[41:46] is perfection just the simple word
[41:50] perfection in verse 1
[41:54] there is therefore now no condemnation
[41:58] to them which are in christ jesus
[42:03] who walk not after the flesh but after
[42:06] the spirit
[42:08] for the law of the spirit of life in
[42:11] christ jesus
[42:13] hath made me free
[42:16] from the law of sin and death notice it
[42:19] was the law
[42:21] of the spirit of life that makes us
[42:25] free from the law of sin and death
[42:28] for what the law could not do
[42:32] in that it was weak through the flesh
[42:36] god sending his own son in the likeness
[42:40] of sinful flesh and for sin
[42:44] condemned sin in the flesh
[42:48] that the righteousness of the law
[42:52] might be fulfilled in us
[42:56] who walk not after the flesh
[42:59] but after the spirit now let me before i
[43:02] have you standing let me just read a
[43:04] quote where we
[43:05] we stopped in on this on thursday night
[43:08] and brother branham reading coming here
[43:10] he says now there's
[43:12] many he's talking about behind the veil
[43:15] being in christ there's many that
[43:17] pretend to be in there and let me just
[43:19] comment on this pretending
[43:23] is where a person knows
[43:26] that everything and their life is not
[43:29] where it ought to be
[43:30] but they're acting as though it is
[43:34] pretending is not a life that is
[43:37] in journey are you with me
[43:41] so here brother brown brings that
[43:43] through there's many that
[43:44] pretend to be in there
[43:48] there's many that's warring themselves
[43:51] and trying to live right and
[43:54] trying to press in i don't know about
[43:57] that
[43:58] but if they are in there it's
[44:02] just as easy to live a christian
[44:05] life as it is to live any life
[44:09] because you're in christ and nothing
[44:11] else but just
[44:12] so full of the holy spirit leads you
[44:16] and guides you and directs you and
[44:19] why sure you'll make mistakes and fall
[44:23] but you can't stay down
[44:28] because no more than you could make a
[44:30] stock of corn or a sycamore tree
[44:32] you can't do that jesus said by their
[44:36] fruits you shall know them
[44:37] you have everlasting life
[44:42] amen so let's look at that here this
[44:44] morning and that thought of perfection
[44:46] and let's just pray together
[44:49] dear heavenly father as we come to this
[44:52] portion lord of the service oh god we
[44:56] are just looking to you this morning
[44:58] that you will come
[45:00] you'll deliver the word to our hearts
[45:02] break every yoke
[45:04] lord god fill every heart lord
[45:07] refill our lives lord heal the sick
[45:09] that's among us
[45:11] lord move in a very special way lord as
[45:13] we're gathered here and those that are
[45:15] gathered
[45:15] by way of the internet we ask lord all
[45:18] these things for the glory of god
[45:20] in the name of jesus christ amen amen
[45:23] god bless you as you're being seated
[45:25] amen i want to when we look at this
[45:28] this thought here we we recognize
[45:32] that in our life um
[45:35] there must come an end to
[45:39] all strife in other words
[45:42] to uh any warring or trying as brother
[45:46] branham words it in that quote of
[45:48] warring or
[45:49] trying to live right there's got to come
[45:52] uh to where it's not striving where
[45:56] to do and and act right but there comes
[45:58] an
[45:59] absolute there comes an uh an anchor on
[46:02] the inside that so completely
[46:05] changes our desires our nature
[46:08] by placing the love of god within us
[46:12] and when we look here in the scripture
[46:15] as it speaks in that
[46:17] final verse of scripture we read that
[46:19] the righteousness of the law might be
[46:21] fulfilled in us
[46:22] who walk not after the flesh but after
[46:24] the spirit
[46:25] the righteousness remember the law
[46:28] itself
[46:29] was glorious the law itself was not sin
[46:34] the law the law itself as paul would
[46:37] write
[46:37] it's holy but the law
[46:40] what we're speaking of the righteousness
[46:43] of the law
[46:45] it now takes the focus
[46:48] off of the law and places it to whom
[46:52] is the very author of that law of that
[46:57] word
[46:57] his righteousness because that's where
[47:00] the law
[47:01] comes from it comes as that which is
[47:04] scripted
[47:05] out of the very righteousness of god
[47:08] himself just like
[47:10] on the back of a package of a seed
[47:13] the words that are there are a script
[47:16] that describes the very life that's
[47:19] inside that seed no matter how big or
[47:21] how small
[47:22] those words describe the life that's in
[47:24] there
[47:25] so the the writing there of the law it
[47:28] was
[47:29] it was the script it's holy because it
[47:32] was that
[47:32] which was which would describe or
[47:36] to uh to describe the very
[47:39] righteousness of god himself so
[47:42] it's his spirit the law giver himself
[47:45] the author that thereby he places that
[47:49] law
[47:49] in our hearts so that our whole being is
[47:52] wrapped and dedicated to the word of god
[47:56] by the holy ghost now in matthew 5 verse
[48:00] 20
[48:01] you know when jesus remember when he's
[48:04] standing here upon the earth
[48:06] here in the temple of his humanity
[48:09] oftentimes here the scribes the lawyers
[48:12] remember
[48:12] scribes and lawyers as they would come
[48:14] to him pharisees
[48:16] they would come and they would try to
[48:18] ensnare him
[48:20] ask him questions what's the greatest
[48:22] commandment and they would go
[48:24] on and on and yet here jesus now
[48:27] speaking to the disciples he says in
[48:30] matthew 5
[48:31] 20 i say unto you that except
[48:35] your righteousness shall exceed
[48:38] the righteousness of the scribes and
[48:41] pharisees
[48:42] you shall in no case enter into the
[48:45] kingdom of heaven
[48:47] now think about it this statement that
[48:49] is made
[48:50] it takes into account the impossibility
[48:54] that even if a man is hitting the law
[48:58] right on the dot it's still it
[49:02] does not gain entrance into the kingdom
[49:04] of heaven
[49:06] so then it's speaking there's got to
[49:08] come
[49:09] a righteousness now if god's asking or
[49:11] requiring this
[49:12] then this is something that god is
[49:15] drawing our attention to
[49:16] he's drawing their attention to it not
[49:19] to condemn them
[49:20] but to show them there is there is a
[49:24] greater
[49:24] reality or to take them from a shadow
[49:28] and a type to the actual anatype
[49:32] or the reality he goes on to say
[49:35] that how that the pharisees in those he
[49:37] says
[49:38] you know they love them that love they
[49:40] love those who love them
[49:42] he says you know everybody is going good
[49:44] with them hey they love them
[49:46] but anybody crosses them look out and
[49:48] this is where he says
[49:50] there's got to come a greater
[49:52] righteousness
[49:53] to where that you even love those who
[49:56] hate
[49:57] you or as he would say in other places
[50:00] pray praying for them that despitefully
[50:03] use you
[50:04] i'm telling you this takes a greater
[50:07] a greater measure i'm not just talking
[50:09] about where something is not said well i
[50:11] didn't say
[50:12] i didn't say a wrong and unkind word to
[50:14] this person no no this is deeper
[50:15] it deals with within the heart because
[50:18] remember malice is an
[50:19] altogether what comes out here malice is
[50:22] what will come out of here
[50:24] and that's why if we entertain things or
[50:26] allow things to dwell
[50:28] in our life even after we have been
[50:31] fully converted
[50:33] that's where the grieving of the holy
[50:34] spirit comes in
[50:36] and that's why we need the spirit of god
[50:38] to move down
[50:39] within our life brother and sister all
[50:42] along it's been him that has brought us
[50:44] to his south
[50:45] and brother and sister when we stand on
[50:47] the other side
[50:48] it'll be because of his grace that has
[50:51] brought us
[50:52] home hallelujah
[50:55] and let's just face it sometimes we
[50:57] can't even see things
[50:58] the way we need to see it but thanks be
[51:02] to god
[51:02] as a child of god god is mindful to come
[51:05] and let us know and say
[51:07] you can't feel this way
[51:10] and we don't just all of a sudden turn
[51:12] the switch okay i'm not going to feel
[51:13] that way no but we ask
[51:15] god lord lord cleanse me lord
[51:18] forgive me for feeling that way
[51:21] entertaining that thought
[51:22] what is that that's working it's the
[51:25] righteousness of
[51:26] god now
[51:30] notice here you see in
[51:33] at the end of this chapter here the lord
[51:36] jesus comes to this place
[51:38] on what righteousness will exceed the
[51:41] righteousness of the pharisees remember
[51:43] let me just just make another point here
[51:45] remember on this of the pharisees
[51:47] these were people you cannot put your
[51:49] finger on their life and say
[51:51] you ain't doing this no no they were
[51:54] doing everything
[51:55] outwardly
[52:00] but the manner in which they did it you
[52:02] see there's a difference
[52:04] it was a righteousness but it was a
[52:06] self-righteousness
[52:08] self-righteousness you can sniff that
[52:11] out like
[52:11] crazy self-righteousness is it brings
[52:15] a condemning dogmatic attitude
[52:20] that's what self-righteous does it
[52:22] brings a looking down your nose and
[52:24] because
[52:24] you're looking at something well i'm
[52:26] doing this
[52:29] that's not the righteousness we're
[52:30] talking about
[52:32] we're talking about a righteousness on
[52:35] the inside
[52:36] that you recognize i didn't put this
[52:39] there
[52:40] god put it there doesn't mean that
[52:44] we they're not talking about
[52:45] compromising with sin i'm talking about
[52:47] a righteousness
[52:48] that on the inside could look and it's
[52:50] not looking at what i've done or what i
[52:53] do
[52:53] but it's looking at the grace of god and
[52:55] to know
[52:56] that god's grace that has been applied
[52:58] to my life what
[53:00] god did for me you do for anybody
[53:03] and if there's something somebody's not
[53:05] seeing and we see they're not seeing it
[53:07] we know that god is able to guide them
[53:10] we've got confidence
[53:12] that that's my brother that's my sister
[53:14] that's the son of god
[53:15] that's the daughter of god and we've got
[53:17] confidence that they can be led by the
[53:20] holy ghost
[53:24] matthew 5 48 jesus said be you
[53:28] therefore perfect man that's a big call
[53:32] even as not not that some way not not
[53:35] part of the way
[53:36] not a little bit but even as to the same
[53:39] degree as your father
[53:43] which is in heaven is perfect
[53:47] now if i ask all throughout this
[53:49] congregation
[53:50] is anybody in here perfect in one way
[53:55] you couldn't raise your hand but if
[53:57] we're talking about
[53:59] his lies his life coming
[54:03] in you that's different we can say we
[54:06] are
[54:06] perfect in him
[54:09] but as far as perfect in myself but i'm
[54:12] always hitting the mark
[54:14] every day every no that's not the
[54:16] perfection i'm talking about
[54:18] we're talking about the perfection of
[54:21] his life
[54:29] so the high calling paul would write
[54:32] about
[54:32] is is god's own perfect
[54:36] life his righteousness coming in
[54:40] us by the baptism of the holy ghost it
[54:43] places
[54:44] us in him it's the perfection
[54:47] of his own life that life that was
[54:50] within that blood cell
[54:52] now it comes upon you
[54:55] and this is where paul would write and
[54:58] testify
[54:59] the life i now live see he lived a
[55:02] different life before
[55:04] paul lived the life remember pharisee of
[55:06] the pharisees
[55:08] you weren't gonna touch that guy's life
[55:10] that guy was right on the mark but
[55:12] notice
[55:12] there is a life he received that was
[55:16] contrary to the life he was living
[55:19] this life he said the life i now live so
[55:22] he lived a different life in the past
[55:24] this life he said
[55:26] i now live by this
[55:29] power of divine revelation what was that
[55:32] the the i live by the faith
[55:35] of the love of god
[55:38] who gave himself for me see what the
[55:41] love of god coming in
[55:43] by divine revelation it presents to you
[55:46] and i
[55:46] a life that has been surrendered
[55:50] a life that is sacrificial a life that
[55:53] has been given
[55:54] and when that revelation of jesus christ
[55:57] is come into our hearts what does it do
[56:00] it brings forth a sacrificial life
[56:03] from you and me sacrificial now let me
[56:07] say
[56:08] sacrificial according to the word
[56:13] according to the word so here
[56:16] paul comes in second corinthians 5
[56:20] 21 and paul would write
[56:23] you know within this measure and he
[56:25] would say
[56:26] for he hath made him to be sin for
[56:30] us who knew no sin that
[56:33] we might be made the righteousness of
[56:37] god in him this is god's work
[56:43] becoming the righteousness of god is not
[56:45] your work
[56:48] it's god's work
[56:51] he presented he came an
[56:54] order that we might come into the
[56:56] righteousness of god
[56:58] his spirit come into you and i he has
[57:01] provided
[57:01] he is jehovah jireh
[57:05] hallelujah this is why paul would write
[57:09] in hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 therefore
[57:13] leaving the principles
[57:16] of the doctrine of christ let us
[57:19] go on to perfection
[57:22] not laying again the foundation of
[57:26] repentance
[57:26] from dead works and of faith toward
[57:30] god in other words paul was saying
[57:34] a cycle of repentance where it's the
[57:37] same thing you need to go
[57:39] on see it's a call
[57:42] let us go on so if the call is let us go
[57:46] on to perfection
[57:47] there is a place of perfection
[57:50] for you and i that we can come to
[57:55] paul being a messenger
[57:58] the prophet in that age he is gifted
[58:01] as a prophet to have eyes that catch up
[58:04] into the realm of the word and see there
[58:07] is a place
[58:10] just like when moses was standing there
[58:13] and god could say
[58:14] moses come here there is a place by me
[58:18] a place by me god sends his word
[58:22] and his word reveals christ and reveals
[58:25] there is a place by him a place
[58:29] where we can come to perfection
[58:32] listen you're perfection where i'll
[58:34] never make a mistake that's not what
[58:36] we're talking about
[58:37] we're talking about a perfection of his
[58:39] lies
[58:42] not laying again the foundation of
[58:44] repentance from dead works
[58:46] and of faith toward notice faith towards
[58:48] god is it necessary faith is necessary
[58:50] he that cometh to god
[58:51] must first believe that he is and he's a
[58:53] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[58:55] him
[58:56] is that right of the doctrine of baptism
[59:00] is it necessary to repent and be
[59:02] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[59:04] christ
[59:04] sure it is all of those are necessary
[59:08] step
[59:08] but they're dead works
[59:13] and of laying on our hands even praying
[59:16] for the sick paul says great glory
[59:19] we're going to keep we're laying on
[59:21] hands on the sick and the resurrection
[59:23] of the dead
[59:24] and of eternal judgment paul is not
[59:26] doing away with any of that
[59:28] and he says and this will we do if god
[59:32] permit so there's got to be a start it's
[59:37] just like
[59:37] we see new ones coming in here there's
[59:40] got to be a start
[59:42] there's got to be that which is
[59:43] presented the gospel presented
[59:46] that lives might move into that place of
[59:49] repentance
[59:50] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[59:51] jesus christ but
[59:53] with the objective to go on to
[59:56] perfection
[59:57] which is to be filled with the holy
[1:00:00] ghost
[1:00:04] perfection is not coming to a church
[1:00:07] that preaches the perfect word amen come
[1:00:10] on we've received
[1:00:11] the perfect interpretation in this hour
[1:00:14] that's
[1:00:15] not enough just to come where it's at
[1:00:19] you've got to receive the direction of
[1:00:21] the word see what the word is saying
[1:00:23] there is a place of perfection the word
[1:00:27] reveals that
[1:00:28] place it unfolds the path the promise
[1:00:30] the path of glory you shall surely find
[1:00:33] it unfolds that pathway to be sons and
[1:00:36] daughters of almighty god
[1:00:40] hallelujah you see
[1:00:43] perfection speaks of
[1:00:46] completion when you see this in the
[1:00:48] scripture
[1:00:49] it speaks of completion completion
[1:00:52] completion remember the bible
[1:00:56] says as god in the days of creation
[1:00:59] god labored for six days
[1:01:02] he labored for six days and remember
[1:01:05] there he renters in the seventh day
[1:01:08] has gone all his works were finished in
[1:01:11] six days
[1:01:12] he entered into that seventh day we
[1:01:15] could really preach here on the seventh
[1:01:16] seal and these things
[1:01:18] you see with the time we're living in
[1:01:20] the hour we're living in
[1:01:22] and to recognize we're not living under
[1:01:24] a word
[1:01:25] of justification we're not living under
[1:01:28] a word
[1:01:28] of sanctification we're not living under
[1:01:31] word of just baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:34] we are living under the word where it is
[1:01:36] that of the son of man
[1:01:38] reproducing himself the fullness of
[1:01:41] christ
[1:01:41] coming in to a bright body this is the
[1:01:44] end time
[1:01:46] where god promised that in the sounding
[1:01:48] of the seventh angel's message
[1:01:50] that the mystery of god what is the
[1:01:53] mystery of god
[1:01:54] it's the outpouring of the holy ghost
[1:01:57] that god making up his body
[1:02:00] down through the ages feet legs hear the
[1:02:03] torso
[1:02:04] on up it's the spirit of god not man not
[1:02:07] by might not by power
[1:02:08] but by my spirit saith the lord how
[1:02:12] is the body the bride body how has it
[1:02:15] been built
[1:02:16] it's been built by the word
[1:02:22] and it holds upon the same pedestal
[1:02:25] as the original masterpiece
[1:02:28] abraham election
[1:02:32] right isaac love
[1:02:36] jacob grace joseph perfection
[1:02:40] that's the pedestal of which the body
[1:02:42] wrestles
[1:02:44] we're resting in the elective love
[1:02:47] and grace of his perfection
[1:02:50] this is our rest you see this is the
[1:02:52] ground we're standing on i didn't choose
[1:02:54] myself he chose me
[1:02:57] i love him because he first loved me
[1:03:00] not by works that i've done but by the
[1:03:02] grace of god i'm standing here
[1:03:05] we have received grace that we might
[1:03:07] serve him acceptably
[1:03:09] and it is not my perfection it's his
[1:03:12] perfection
[1:03:13] inside of me
[1:03:18] glory so it's the hour that we're living
[1:03:21] and we're not preaching
[1:03:22] uh when we are here and remember the
[1:03:24] inspiration on the word
[1:03:26] does not just take us i want to say this
[1:03:29] in the right measure
[1:03:30] it just doesn't take us to where many of
[1:03:33] the nominal christians
[1:03:34] they simply or can just they'll look
[1:03:36] back to calvary
[1:03:37] but remember they failed to recognize
[1:03:40] there that god who became flesh he is
[1:03:44] present
[1:03:45] to identify what he did there in you and
[1:03:48] me
[1:03:50] because just to put it back there it it
[1:03:53] it leaves out that he's the same
[1:03:55] it leaves out the same life it leaves
[1:03:57] out the purpose
[1:03:58] which is redemption
[1:04:01] it takes us into that place
[1:04:04] of perfection now so we recognize that
[1:04:07] the bride
[1:04:09] of jesus christ i believe i'm speaking
[1:04:12] to a portion of her
[1:04:14] she's standing on her feet
[1:04:17] are you with me she's born of his bone
[1:04:22] life of his life come on adam's bride
[1:04:26] didn't come from somewhere else
[1:04:27] adam's bride came from him
[1:04:31] when is the bride of jesus christ come
[1:04:33] sup the word
[1:04:34] from his life right
[1:04:38] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life
[1:04:40] of his life
[1:04:41] she is his perfection
[1:04:44] in bright form
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:48] his achievement his workmanship
[1:04:53] hebrews 9 11 christ being coming high
[1:04:56] priest
[1:04:57] of good things to come by greater and
[1:04:59] more perfect
[1:05:00] tabernacle not made with hands that is
[1:05:03] to say not of this building
[1:05:05] perfect tabernacle yet it was made in
[1:05:07] the likeness of sinful flesh but it was
[1:05:09] not
[1:05:09] authored through sex
[1:05:13] neither by the blood of goats
[1:05:16] and calves but by his own blood he
[1:05:19] entered in once unto the holy place
[1:05:22] having obtained eternal redemption
[1:05:26] for us this is the beginning of the
[1:05:30] creation of god
[1:05:31] notice hebrews 10 1 for the law
[1:05:34] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:05:38] and not the very image of the things can
[1:05:40] never
[1:05:41] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:05:44] year by year continually
[1:05:45] make the comers thereunto perfect
[1:05:50] for then they would would then they not
[1:05:52] then would they not have ceased to be
[1:05:54] offered
[1:05:54] because that the worshipers once purged
[1:05:57] should have had no more
[1:05:58] conscience or desire of sin
[1:06:02] they covered it was forgiveness but the
[1:06:05] desire was still there
[1:06:08] you're with me this is why paul as he
[1:06:12] goes on
[1:06:13] hebrews 7 19 for the law made nothing
[1:06:16] perfect righteousness of the pharisees
[1:06:21] could not put a finger on their law on
[1:06:23] their life
[1:06:24] but that righteousness does not gain
[1:06:27] entrance
[1:06:29] remember they crucified jesus
[1:06:34] by their own righteousness
[1:06:37] paul picks it up in romans they sought
[1:06:40] not the righteousness of god
[1:06:42] by faith they sought it by works
[1:06:46] and seeking it by works they failed oh
[1:06:48] my yes
[1:06:49] this is why as god as he deals
[1:06:53] with our hearts deals with our life the
[1:06:56] righteousness of god
[1:06:57] listen you can't make yourself good
[1:07:00] enough
[1:07:01] i wish i could preach a long time on
[1:07:03] this that doesn't mean that you just sat
[1:07:05] around with your arms crossed and
[1:07:07] well you know just to have to be god to
[1:07:09] do it no
[1:07:11] it's faith in his word and applying that
[1:07:15] to
[1:07:15] your life and watch it take effect
[1:07:19] faith what does it faith faith
[1:07:24] god will testify of his work
[1:07:28] hebrews 9 13 for if the blood of bulls
[1:07:32] and goats
[1:07:32] and the ashes of the heifer sprinkling
[1:07:35] the unclean
[1:07:37] sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[1:07:39] see all this was tight all of this was
[1:07:43] right in the old testament and what was
[1:07:45] given there
[1:07:46] was types that would speak of the
[1:07:49] redemptive work
[1:07:51] uh through calvary through the lord
[1:07:54] jesus christ
[1:07:55] now where it's no longer a type but it
[1:07:58] becomes the antitype
[1:08:02] the heifer was burnt was taken was
[1:08:05] killed
[1:08:06] burnt without the camp ashes were mixed
[1:08:09] in
[1:08:09] clean water had to be a clean man to
[1:08:12] bring it
[1:08:13] right right had to be one to catch that
[1:08:16] revelation
[1:08:16] that's beyond the camp come on it cannot
[1:08:19] be just a man
[1:08:20] you see this is why if people limited to
[1:08:23] the body of jesus christ well that's the
[1:08:25] clean man
[1:08:26] he came and paid the price but remember
[1:08:29] through that
[1:08:30] he sanctifies other vessels that then
[1:08:33] threw their lives through those seven
[1:08:34] stars in his hand they themselves come
[1:08:38] into that place to let you and i know
[1:08:40] let's go beyond the camp
[1:08:43] it calls us what out of tradition out of
[1:08:46] dogma
[1:08:47] out of creed it calls us out of our own
[1:08:49] thinking what is it
[1:08:50] there's a voice that that star receives
[1:08:54] god spoke to the messenger in this hour
[1:08:57] and what does it do
[1:08:58] it reveals the godhead it reveals jesus
[1:09:02] christ
[1:09:02] it reveals there is a place
[1:09:07] beyond the camp of our thinking
[1:09:11] in him see somebody goes beyond and
[1:09:15] comes back to tell us what's there
[1:09:25] how much more look at that how much more
[1:09:29] shall the blood of christ who through
[1:09:31] the eternal spirit
[1:09:33] offered himself without spot to god
[1:09:36] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:09:40] serve the living god
[1:09:41] see the spirit of god is calling
[1:09:45] to that of the scriptures you know i'm
[1:09:48] pulling from here
[1:09:49] is out of the hebrews paul is dividing
[1:09:52] the law
[1:09:52] in grace he's letting him know that just
[1:09:56] coming to church
[1:09:57] he's letting him know just dead works
[1:09:59] and i'm let me i believe in coming to
[1:10:01] church
[1:10:02] but just things that are are just you've
[1:10:04] went through
[1:10:05] things you've come along and mine doing
[1:10:07] pretty good and
[1:10:08] my no no we don't want dead works let's
[1:10:11] go on to perfection
[1:10:13] to where it removes from your works
[1:10:17] to christ in you working amen amen
[1:10:23] amen dead works
[1:10:27] is reflected at what took place around
[1:10:30] cadiz barnea
[1:10:31] they walked around the same mountain for
[1:10:34] 40 years
[1:10:35] why god didn't make them do that that
[1:10:38] was their own belief
[1:10:40] unbelief will keep you growing in
[1:10:43] circles what must i do
[1:10:44] throw it down that's simple oh i need
[1:10:48] hands laying on you don't need hands
[1:10:49] laid on you you need to have faith in
[1:10:51] the word
[1:10:54] and say god i lay it down
[1:11:01] see many times that's why people don't
[1:11:02] get deliverance they've got faith in the
[1:11:04] man
[1:11:07] talks about a a lady who's in and it's a
[1:11:10] faith in his faith i think his faith is
[1:11:11] our victory
[1:11:12] who smokes cigarettes oh he said she'd
[1:11:14] come to the altar and cry
[1:11:15] god i need to be free of these
[1:11:16] cigarettes he said we would pray with
[1:11:18] her he said you'd see her about a week
[1:11:20] later she'd about knock you down with
[1:11:21] cigarette breath
[1:11:23] but it got to a time in her life she got
[1:11:25] struck with cancer
[1:11:27] brother brown said then about that time
[1:11:29] he said he went to pray for
[1:11:31] he said we went to pray for he said she
[1:11:33] got down to business
[1:11:34] he said what she did notice it wasn't
[1:11:37] that god
[1:11:38] gave her faith brother brown says she
[1:11:40] changed
[1:11:41] her faith from in the branham tabernacle
[1:11:44] changed it from in william branham and
[1:11:47] she put it
[1:11:48] where it needed to be in the beginning
[1:11:50] in
[1:11:51] jesus christ the ministry
[1:11:54] the prophet all of that is to point you
[1:11:57] to one person and that's jesus christ
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:01] [Applause]
[1:12:07] god hallelujah men but our faith is in
[1:12:10] god not the man his
[1:12:14] person amen
[1:12:22] hebrews 10 21 and having a high priest
[1:12:26] over the house of god let us
[1:12:30] draw near how many knows we need a high
[1:12:34] priest
[1:12:38] still
[1:12:42] when he changes his garments from lamb
[1:12:45] to lion that's when we'll change
[1:12:50] until that very moment we need the lamb
[1:12:55] we need the lamb interceding on our
[1:12:58] behalf it's not just about what we do
[1:13:01] wrong
[1:13:01] not just about mistakes that's such a
[1:13:05] very limited small
[1:13:06] minut view but the working of the high
[1:13:08] priest
[1:13:09] is to minister those things on our
[1:13:12] behalf or in other words
[1:13:14] minister to you and i what he has
[1:13:16] already
[1:13:17] done and what lays in you and i and you
[1:13:20] and i begin to recognize oh that leaf is
[1:13:22] in me
[1:13:23] oh that bushel of apples is in me and
[1:13:25] then we go to him and say lord
[1:13:27] be it unto me according to thy word and
[1:13:30] what are we doing we
[1:13:31] are confessing what his word has
[1:13:34] confessed
[1:13:35] and he is the high priest
[1:13:38] of our confession is that right
[1:13:42] so now this is why let us draw near with
[1:13:45] a true heart in
[1:13:46] full assurance having our hearts
[1:13:48] sprinkled
[1:13:49] from an evil conscience and our
[1:13:52] bodies washed with pure water
[1:13:56] paul was not speaking of that this body
[1:13:58] paul speaking of the washing
[1:14:01] of water by the word that loosens us
[1:14:04] from that first nature amen
[1:14:07] it takes the old man out by what
[1:14:09] watching of regeneration
[1:14:11] renewing of the holy ghost it's one and
[1:14:13] the same it's the sovereign work
[1:14:15] of the holy ghost you see this is why
[1:14:18] when the seed of the word is on the
[1:14:20] inside
[1:14:22] uh you know there's a there there is
[1:14:25] only one thing
[1:14:26] that can quicken that seed and that's
[1:14:29] the holy ghost
[1:14:32] but in order for the holy ghost the
[1:14:34] quickening power to come
[1:14:36] there must be the right filter
[1:14:40] a filter of justification will not
[1:14:44] quicken the seed
[1:14:45] all right it is any work of the holy
[1:14:48] ghost
[1:14:48] person feels relieved oh my sins i
[1:14:51] praise god that's a wonderful thing
[1:14:53] you see the the filter of just
[1:14:56] sanctification by the blood it will not
[1:14:59] in this hour
[1:15:00] it will not quicken the blood it will
[1:15:02] not quicken to see
[1:15:04] it's got to be the word that matches the
[1:15:07] word
[1:15:08] on the inside amen that's why a message
[1:15:11] of just oh praise god
[1:15:13] the restoration of the gifts it will not
[1:15:15] quicken
[1:15:16] the seed oh brother samuel you ought to
[1:15:20] see how so-and-so is so gifted and
[1:15:22] mind what they can do in the message a
[1:15:24] prisoner brother ram said don't you
[1:15:26] ever judge your life by how much
[1:15:28] demonstrations
[1:15:29] and all this that you can do you judge
[1:15:31] it by the fruits
[1:15:33] that is brought forth by their fruits
[1:15:36] not by their healings not by their
[1:15:38] preaching not by their speaking in
[1:15:40] tongues
[1:15:40] not by their prophesy not by anything
[1:15:42] else but by their fruits
[1:15:45] you shall know them
[1:15:49] is that right so then we find
[1:15:52] it's got to be a filter one more what
[1:15:54] kind of filter must it be
[1:15:56] it must be a word filter
[1:15:59] this is why god once again
[1:16:02] why god would send a message in this
[1:16:04] hour
[1:16:05] because a denominational filter
[1:16:09] it can it'll still allow sin to remain
[1:16:12] there
[1:16:14] a person brother bran brings us down the
[1:16:16] message perfection
[1:16:18] he said they can be free of desire
[1:16:21] but if it's still nature it's still
[1:16:23] condemned
[1:16:24] so you can take a person and say well i
[1:16:26] ain't never desired to look at this or
[1:16:28] do this or do that
[1:16:29] i never but by nature you're still
[1:16:31] condemned
[1:16:32] right by nature many of the people can
[1:16:34] exhibit
[1:16:35] many of the virtues that peter would
[1:16:37] write of by the spirit of god but it's
[1:16:39] not by
[1:16:39] natural exhibition of patience and
[1:16:42] long-suffering no no
[1:16:43] these these virtues that peter writes
[1:16:45] about the spirit of god
[1:16:47] these are virtues that are not virtues
[1:16:49] that come out in times of peace
[1:16:51] they are virtues that come out in times
[1:16:53] of war in times of adversity
[1:16:55] in times where it gets awful hard on
[1:16:57] this guy
[1:16:58] but this is where the light shines the
[1:17:00] brightest
[1:17:03] anybody raising your hand say god let it
[1:17:05] be times of war in me lord
[1:17:07] let it be times and no you ain't being
[1:17:09] truthful and we're not saying that we
[1:17:10] don't want to say oh god
[1:17:11] bring on the trout no no no
[1:17:15] but yet we know that it's in those times
[1:17:17] of adversity
[1:17:19] is where growth takes place
[1:17:23] and we need that but you see this is
[1:17:26] something that we look at this here
[1:17:28] that this filter it has to be that there
[1:17:31] is a word
[1:17:32] that the spirit of god is able to travel
[1:17:35] through that word
[1:17:36] so that here as as we would take that
[1:17:38] word in
[1:17:39] it comes down into our soul what does
[1:17:42] the word
[1:17:42] the preaching of the word brings the
[1:17:45] holy ghost
[1:17:48] not just quoting the preaching
[1:17:51] the preaching of the word the
[1:17:54] inspiration
[1:17:55] of god it brings there the holy ghost on
[1:17:59] the scene
[1:18:00] and that heart on the inside it's
[1:18:02] drawing it's drawing what is it
[1:18:04] it's a son or a daughter of god that's
[1:18:06] been there the whole time
[1:18:08] but you need a filter a real word filter
[1:18:11] because only a word filter will allow
[1:18:14] the quickening
[1:18:15] power of god to come down and quicken
[1:18:18] your life
[1:18:24] this is why we've been summonsed by the
[1:18:27] voice of god
[1:18:30] vindicated by god
[1:18:33] amen
[1:18:36] we've been summoned to god by his voice
[1:18:41] god had a vessel in this earth behold i
[1:18:44] sent unto elijah
[1:18:45] one who could go beyond the camp
[1:18:49] god took him beyond the camp to do what
[1:18:52] called you and i
[1:18:53] out of the camp amen amen
[1:18:56] call us into a real relationship a real
[1:18:59] union with jesus christ
[1:19:01] because the truth be known there's
[1:19:02] nothing else that will satisfy
[1:19:04] a son and daughter of god i could preach
[1:19:07] this to her go
[1:19:08] out here he can go out on the internet
[1:19:10] and people can say
[1:19:11] i'm gent i'm fine but through a real son
[1:19:14] and daughter of god
[1:19:15] there's something about it they're
[1:19:16] drawing on that word and say god
[1:19:18] take me higher lord take me deeper lord
[1:19:20] take me deeper and you lord
[1:19:22] i want to go higher
[1:19:28] this is why paul comes around in
[1:19:30] colossians 2 9 for in him
[1:19:32] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[1:19:34] bodily and you are
[1:19:36] complete in him
[1:19:39] which is the head of all principality
[1:19:41] and power known as complete
[1:19:43] perfection where in him in whom
[1:19:47] also ye are circumcised
[1:19:50] with the circumcision made without hands
[1:19:54] in putting off the body of the sins of
[1:19:57] this flesh
[1:19:58] once again he's speaking of the nature
[1:20:02] that nature there's been a circumcision
[1:20:06] right amen
[1:20:09] circumcision requires a sharp knife
[1:20:14] butter knives won't do it
[1:20:18] won't do it
[1:20:21] match that you know those sharp things
[1:20:23] that you you know put the cake icing on
[1:20:26] and
[1:20:26] make it you know all nice and that won't
[1:20:28] do it it's got to be a sharp knife
[1:20:31] when they crossed into the land told
[1:20:34] joshua
[1:20:35] make sharp knives
[1:20:41] why the circumcision is a sign
[1:20:44] not so much to god it was a sign
[1:20:48] to them to know him in the covenant
[1:20:51] and everything that god has said i have
[1:20:54] access to i'm identified in the covenant
[1:20:58] that's why that faith when it's
[1:21:01] recognized
[1:21:02] by god he seals you with the holy ghost
[1:21:11] praise the lord by the circumcision of
[1:21:14] christ buried with him in baptism
[1:21:18] wherein also you are risen with him
[1:21:20] through the faith of the operation of
[1:21:22] god
[1:21:22] who hath raised him from the dead so we
[1:21:25] walked with him in the waters of baptism
[1:21:27] identified with him
[1:21:29] in his death burial and resurrection
[1:21:32] what that you through
[1:21:33] faith the operation of god not my
[1:21:36] operation
[1:21:37] not a church operation but the operation
[1:21:40] of god
[1:21:41] you see this is why he comes and he
[1:21:44] speaks to your heart
[1:21:45] this is why he appears in these services
[1:21:48] this is why he comes by his word why
[1:21:51] it's to bring forth
[1:21:53] the operation of god a pastor can do it
[1:21:56] a church can do it but him coming can
[1:21:59] cause your faith to rise to a place to
[1:22:02] say
[1:22:03] he's the same he's speaking to me these
[1:22:05] are my promises
[1:22:10] and i say if there's anything if there's
[1:22:13] uh listen to me
[1:22:14] if there's unconfessed sin and you know
[1:22:17] it's unconfessed
[1:22:19] don't expect god to move over top of
[1:22:21] that
[1:22:23] you've got to confess and repent and
[1:22:27] separate yourself
[1:22:31] amen somebody help me preach now
[1:22:35] that's faith in god we could pray for
[1:22:38] you for a month of sundays
[1:22:40] but if there's unconfessed sin god ain't
[1:22:43] crossing over that
[1:22:46] you don't want that you don't want that
[1:22:49] because if god crosses over
[1:22:50] unconfessed sin and does that for you
[1:22:53] you'll continue
[1:22:54] in that same way and that is not
[1:22:57] perfection
[1:23:02] god wants you to be free amen amen
[1:23:06] walking in liberty this is why paul's he
[1:23:10] would
[1:23:10] go on first corinthians 1 verse 30 but
[1:23:13] of him are ye in christ jesus
[1:23:15] who of god is made unto us wisdom he is
[1:23:18] our wisdom not our wisdom he is our
[1:23:21] wisdom
[1:23:22] he is my righteousness he is my
[1:23:25] sanctification
[1:23:27] he's the oil in the dove he's the oil
[1:23:30] that moves out of my life
[1:23:32] when sticky situations come he's the oil
[1:23:35] that moves out of my life
[1:23:38] when it's not saying entrap but there's
[1:23:40] a life there's an
[1:23:41] oil on the inside it's not coming
[1:23:43] somewhere else
[1:23:44] it's an oil on the inside that purifies
[1:23:48] what does that the perfection of his
[1:23:51] life
[1:23:52] it's the perfection of his life that
[1:23:54] says go make that right
[1:23:56] right it's the perfection of his life it
[1:23:57] says drop that
[1:24:01] amen attitude when is that it's a
[1:24:03] perfection of his life
[1:24:05] if he listen to me how could he how
[1:24:08] could he
[1:24:09] have been the lamb of god and not
[1:24:11] fulfill every part of the word
[1:24:13] he couldn't have done it so because it
[1:24:16] was god
[1:24:17] come down and dwell in that body and
[1:24:19] that same god living inside of you and i
[1:24:21] he will not let one part go unnoticed in
[1:24:24] our life
[1:24:26] if there's something a little slacking
[1:24:28] he'll bring us right in step
[1:24:30] when is that that's perfection amen
[1:24:34] colossians 3 3 for ye are dead
[1:24:39] and your life is hid with christ in god
[1:24:43] when christ who is our life
[1:24:48] he is our life he's everything
[1:24:52] he's our all in all see this is deeper
[1:24:55] than just somebody saying
[1:24:57] i love god amen truly they can love god
[1:25:01] but if it's still the world in their
[1:25:03] life and they're dwelling there
[1:25:05] in that part and still everything else
[1:25:08] then it's not the love of god dwelling
[1:25:10] in them
[1:25:11] it's them loving god by their spirit
[1:25:14] their
[1:25:14] intellect this scripture
[1:25:17] is he is our life in other words
[1:25:21] he's not just something that's out here
[1:25:24] this is where he's at everything
[1:25:27] revolves around
[1:25:29] him amen
[1:25:32] should i take this job revolves around
[1:25:34] him
[1:25:36] everything comes through him he is the
[1:25:39] north star of our life
[1:25:41] amen amen
[1:25:47] praise the lord glory be to god
[1:25:52] notice this is the promise when christ
[1:25:55] who is our life
[1:25:57] shall appear then shall you also appear
[1:25:59] with him in glory
[1:26:01] you see guard god clear back
[1:26:05] in the time of the exodus what was
[1:26:08] it that released the people from egypt
[1:26:12] many signs and wonders were done right
[1:26:15] but signs and wonders didn't release
[1:26:16] them
[1:26:17] signs and wonders were not just there to
[1:26:20] build
[1:26:20] faith but the signs and wonders were
[1:26:23] there
[1:26:24] for god to show himself now moses
[1:26:28] god through moses ministry it was god
[1:26:31] declaring never mind my man couldn't do
[1:26:33] this but what did that do
[1:26:35] it hardened pharaoh's heart god
[1:26:38] revealing himself
[1:26:39] making himself known so much to where
[1:26:42] you know pharaoh would say
[1:26:43] oh his god is god and i'll call him to
[1:26:46] take away the pledge
[1:26:47] see it was known there is one in egypt
[1:26:50] greater than all the gods of egypt but
[1:26:53] did it soften pharaoh
[1:26:55] no it hardened him
[1:26:58] amen but it led up to the night of the
[1:27:02] exodus
[1:27:04] god said take a lamb slay the lamb
[1:27:08] put the blood on the doorpost eat the
[1:27:11] lamb inside your dwelling
[1:27:12] and when i see the blood
[1:27:16] amen i will pass over you
[1:27:21] when i see what was the blood the blood
[1:27:24] was now the indication where
[1:27:28] they had received the word
[1:27:31] here come a ah they had a delivering
[1:27:33] sign of circumcision
[1:27:35] but moving on there in the word the
[1:27:37] blood had to be applied
[1:27:38] the blood being applied now death could
[1:27:42] not come in
[1:27:43] to that amen hole
[1:27:46] who it would come after is the firstborn
[1:27:51] but the blood spares the life of the
[1:27:54] firstborn
[1:27:56] it wasn't enough just because they were
[1:27:57] first born but you had to be away
[1:28:00] that the firstborn could escape judgment
[1:28:05] oh my i'm just going to stay focused
[1:28:08] here how can we get off and preach on
[1:28:09] that
[1:28:09] on strength but it had to be a blood and
[1:28:12] this is what
[1:28:12] god has said when i see the blood you
[1:28:15] see listen to me
[1:28:16] the holy ghost and this is for everyone
[1:28:18] to apply this
[1:28:20] remember the holy ghost just does not
[1:28:22] come and baptize somebody
[1:28:24] and put them into the body of christ if
[1:28:26] they're not applying the word
[1:28:28] amen that's contrary to scripture
[1:28:31] take the lamb slaver bud jesus said if
[1:28:34] you love me
[1:28:35] keep my commandments you keep my
[1:28:37] commandments then my father and i will
[1:28:39] come and make our abode
[1:28:42] you can't expect the holy ghost if
[1:28:44] you're not applying the word
[1:28:46] amen so what is the blood you say i
[1:28:49] can't apply the blood yes you can
[1:28:51] jesus said my words are spirit and life
[1:28:53] it's not that blood that blood
[1:28:55] chemistry went right back into the
[1:28:56] ground from calvary
[1:28:58] it wouldn't matter if you had a little
[1:29:00] vial of that blood it couldn't do
[1:29:01] nothing for you right now
[1:29:03] it paid the debt but now
[1:29:07] the blood is now represented
[1:29:10] and tied in to the spirit because the
[1:29:13] blood itself was shed
[1:29:14] but now the spirit comes to sound out a
[1:29:18] jubilee call and let you know there is
[1:29:21] blood
[1:29:21] on the mercy seat there is blood that
[1:29:24] has a cone for you
[1:29:25] you can come back to your inheritance
[1:29:30] they were in the field slaving away they
[1:29:33] did not see the blood
[1:29:35] on the mercy seat but there was a priest
[1:29:38] that rode throughout the land
[1:29:39] and the sounding was synchronized with
[1:29:43] the blood
[1:29:43] that was offered so the blood
[1:29:47] the sounding of the voice the light the
[1:29:52] life
[1:29:53] the word it is god coming
[1:29:56] and when we take the word what is the
[1:29:59] blood
[1:30:00] it is the spirit revealed
[1:30:04] word
[1:30:08] that's why pentecost don't get anywhere
[1:30:10] they think pentecost is just coming
[1:30:12] and getting under an emotion
[1:30:16] it takes the word the word brings
[1:30:19] atmosphere genesis 1
[1:30:21] the word brings creation the word comes
[1:30:24] with purpose
[1:30:25] the word comes with vision the word
[1:30:27] comes with clarity
[1:30:29] is that right you see the word has got
[1:30:32] to be applied amen
[1:30:34] i'm encouraging you by the spirit of god
[1:30:37] that no matter where you are
[1:30:39] new middle old no matter where you are
[1:30:42] you cannot expect
[1:30:43] god to do anything for you if you're not
[1:30:45] willing to apply the blood
[1:30:48] that's right don't let them in the
[1:30:50] message be medicine on the shelf
[1:30:54] humble yourself and take it
[1:30:58] if it says take one pill every 12 hours
[1:31:00] humble yourself and take and be right on
[1:31:02] the mark
[1:31:03] i'm going to set a timer for this here
[1:31:05] what is it
[1:31:06] you're putting value
[1:31:11] you've got to want you've got to want
[1:31:13] the holy ghost
[1:31:16] you've got to want to be united with god
[1:31:18] amen
[1:31:20] it's not it's not god being angry it's
[1:31:23] god trying to let you know
[1:31:24] let's go on to perfection
[1:31:28] let's stop making the same footprints
[1:31:30] around the same mountain
[1:31:31] let's go on to perfection let's stop
[1:31:34] coming to the altar
[1:31:36] and repenting for the same thing let's
[1:31:38] go on
[1:31:39] to perfection what must i do lay
[1:31:43] [Applause]
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:53] for by one offering look how paul places
[1:31:55] this for by one offering
[1:31:59] he hath perfected forever them
[1:32:03] that are sanctified now paul's not
[1:32:06] speaking just
[1:32:07] of where a person comes to
[1:32:08] sanctification to where the desires
[1:32:10] leave their life
[1:32:11] that's sanctification but he's talking
[1:32:13] about
[1:32:14] sanctified sainted ones those who are
[1:32:18] full
[1:32:18] of the holy ghost
[1:32:21] what does that mean i mean i don't have
[1:32:24] to have another offering
[1:32:26] i'm identified with my offering
[1:32:30] here here he is seated on the mercy seat
[1:32:33] of god on the throne of god
[1:32:34] he is seated in power until all of his
[1:32:37] enemies
[1:32:38] it be made manifest that every enemy is
[1:32:40] under his feet
[1:32:42] he's seated in power though we see not
[1:32:45] all things
[1:32:46] but yet he's already amen and when you
[1:32:49] and i have been raised in him by the
[1:32:51] holy ghost
[1:32:52] we are seated sons and daughters of god
[1:32:56] as the prophet would put it sin is
[1:32:59] beneath you
[1:33:03] hallelujah it's beneath you
[1:33:07] by one offering we are kept clean
[1:33:11] right we're kept clean by one offering
[1:33:16] because the life of our sacrifice
[1:33:19] has come inside of you and i you see
[1:33:21] remember when god
[1:33:23] when god was speaking in ezekiel when he
[1:33:25] was speaking
[1:33:26] there in uh jeremiah paul picks it up in
[1:33:29] hebrews where it says the days shall
[1:33:31] come i will make a new covenant
[1:33:33] not as the covenant i made with my
[1:33:34] father the fathers ended the whole day
[1:33:36] when i took them by the hand and let
[1:33:37] them out of egypt
[1:33:38] but this covenant i will make with them
[1:33:40] i will write my laws
[1:33:42] into their mind i will i will write them
[1:33:45] i will play them in the mind i'll put
[1:33:47] them upon
[1:33:47] the tables of their heart and i will be
[1:33:50] their god
[1:33:53] what i will be that visible living
[1:33:57] reality that's pulsating in their life
[1:34:00] where it was before in the old testament
[1:34:03] they had the law here and the blood here
[1:34:07] but god is saying this will be one
[1:34:11] jesus said i and my father are one
[1:34:15] lawgiver dwelling in that of the lamb
[1:34:19] the law would have killed us brother
[1:34:21] brian but there was a lamb
[1:34:23] standing there to intercede on our
[1:34:26] behalf
[1:34:27] so now it's no longer two heavens and
[1:34:30] earth
[1:34:31] have joined together mercy and grace
[1:34:34] have met for what now the issue
[1:34:37] of his life which is the lawgiver
[1:34:40] himself which is the righteousness of
[1:34:43] god
[1:34:44] it's issued forth to the believer you
[1:34:47] have his
[1:34:48] law his life his nature
[1:34:51] that portion of him that belonged to you
[1:34:54] from the for the foundation of the world
[1:34:57] this
[1:34:58] is your inheritance
[1:35:03] and joshua has divided
[1:35:06] to you your inheritance
[1:35:21] first john 3 4.
[1:35:26] john writes whosoever committeth sin
[1:35:30] that word committeth
[1:35:31] means a practicer from nature or desire
[1:35:35] practices sin transgresseth also the law
[1:35:39] for sin is the transgression of the law
[1:35:43] so when john's not writing not he's not
[1:35:45] talking about
[1:35:46] a mistake he's talking about practice
[1:35:48] verse 5 and you know
[1:35:50] that he was manifested to take away our
[1:35:54] sins
[1:35:55] and in him is no sin you see the
[1:35:57] ministry
[1:36:02] the ministry that's sounding out this is
[1:36:05] why
[1:36:06] trumpets this is why down through the
[1:36:08] ages
[1:36:09] after revelation is given it starts
[1:36:11] getting off there's a sounding going on
[1:36:13] but that sounding doesn't bring
[1:36:14] certainty
[1:36:15] hallelujah because why it becomes it
[1:36:18] becomes
[1:36:19] man blowing his ideas and it doesn't
[1:36:22] gather people to christ
[1:36:24] it gathers people to the man gathers it
[1:36:27] to the idea
[1:36:28] gathers it to the organization and in
[1:36:30] that there is no power
[1:36:33] i'm not talking about miracles inside
[1:36:35] i'm talking about the power
[1:36:37] of a life that the pardon brings
[1:36:40] hallelujah that's what i'm talking about
[1:36:46] hallelujah it comes with that he comes
[1:36:49] to take away that's why the gospel
[1:36:51] when the gospel is sound he can hack an
[1:36:53] ear
[1:36:54] in every one of the church ages he that
[1:36:56] hath an ear
[1:36:58] let him hear what the spirit not the
[1:37:00] church
[1:37:01] it's not a church revelation not a group
[1:37:04] revelation
[1:37:05] not a collective revelation this is an
[1:37:07] individual
[1:37:09] revelation
[1:37:12] let him hear what the spirit says
[1:37:17] it's astounding what is the sound they
[1:37:19] do it's a
[1:37:20] sounding of the the atonement himself
[1:37:23] that is sounding through that ministry
[1:37:26] calling
[1:37:27] the people into that place
[1:37:30] of redemption
[1:37:34] all respond no because not all are sons
[1:37:36] and daughters of god
[1:37:40] there are some as in every age they're
[1:37:42] saved
[1:37:44] they gone for that i don't look down on
[1:37:46] that
[1:37:47] right because no more than i can look up
[1:37:49] or look down my nose
[1:37:51] look where we're at no it's god's grace
[1:37:53] i didn't do this
[1:37:55] it's not that i just did and no i didn't
[1:37:57] bring myself here neither did you but to
[1:37:59] recognize why we are where we're at
[1:38:00] and be able to respond and to hear the
[1:38:02] word of god is because we were a seed of
[1:38:04] god all along
[1:38:07] what is that grace grace
[1:38:11] it would have bypassed us long time ago
[1:38:16] oh by the time you know my mind it when
[1:38:18] your mind caught it
[1:38:21] was that that's the seed on the inside
[1:38:24] god don't set down in your flesh body he
[1:38:26] done sat down in your spirit
[1:38:28] he sets down in that which belongs to
[1:38:30] him that's that soul
[1:38:31] that's at sea gene that's a germ of god
[1:38:34] that's the one that can receive
[1:38:35] melchizedek
[1:38:36] that's the one who recognizes him it's
[1:38:38] the inner man
[1:38:39] on the inside
[1:38:43] you know what i'm talking about your
[1:38:44] flesh and spirit still gives you trouble
[1:38:46] come on your flesh and spirit will still
[1:38:48] echo the words of the liar well you're
[1:38:49] not one of them you're not this so
[1:38:51] you're not that you'll never be there
[1:38:52] you never but you see
[1:38:53] there's a token that's come to your life
[1:38:56] a perfection that you can stand there
[1:38:59] and say i've already received
[1:39:01] a voice that has roared in my life that
[1:39:05] says
[1:39:05] you belong to me you're
[1:39:09] mine what is it he's claiming
[1:39:12] his property
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:16] and just as the roar claims
[1:39:20] that so the roar will claim this body
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:32] i tell you what man i don't know what to
[1:39:34] do
[1:39:36] brother william i feel like i'm back in
[1:39:37] africa maybe i need to come down here
[1:39:39] and dance a little bit
[1:39:42] but i'm saying you're in the flesh
[1:39:43] absolutely a son of god that's making
[1:39:45] his flesh
[1:39:46] be obedient to the word a son of god
[1:39:49] that says
[1:39:49] let me borrow your feet i need to dance
[1:39:52] a little bit a son of god that says
[1:39:54] let me boil your hands i need to clap a
[1:39:56] little bit a son of garbage says
[1:39:58] let me bother your mouth i need to shout
[1:40:00] a little bit
[1:40:01] what is it it's the son and daughter of
[1:40:04] god rejoicing
[1:40:05] in the glory we had with him
[1:40:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:40:31] a perfection of his life
[1:40:35] let's just stop here i won't be able to
[1:40:38] lay that other point in
[1:40:46] perfection but somehow i make so many
[1:40:50] mistakes
[1:40:53] i hear the prophet of god in the message
[1:40:55] believing god
[1:40:57] he said don't ever get your eyes or your
[1:41:01] thinking
[1:41:03] as though that you're ever going to
[1:41:05] perfect
[1:41:06] this
[1:41:10] he said before this can ever be
[1:41:13] perfected when is this going to be
[1:41:14] perfected
[1:41:15] at the change of the body
[1:41:18] it first must be the spirit of god on
[1:41:20] the inside
[1:41:22] that will bring it in subjection maybe
[1:41:25] i'm just a simple guy by the way maybe
[1:41:26] i'm not real
[1:41:27] you know i know people think well this
[1:41:28] guy's got a master degree that'll make
[1:41:30] me smart that just means because i
[1:41:31] relied on god a lot
[1:41:33] that ain't to puff me up i'm just that
[1:41:35] this is how i feel
[1:41:41] it shows there are thoughts there are
[1:41:44] things that will come right at
[1:41:46] this it doesn't mean oh my
[1:41:50] i'll come to a place i'll never have a
[1:41:52] thought of hatred arise
[1:41:53] no don't try to perfect this that's when
[1:41:56] you get down
[1:41:57] and discouraged but bringing in
[1:41:59] subjection
[1:42:01] when it starts to rise there's a new
[1:42:03] king in the kingdom
[1:42:05] there's a new king in the kingdom that
[1:42:07] says
[1:42:08] not in my reign and it isn't like we're
[1:42:12] saying oh god but
[1:42:13] i wanna no on the inside what does it do
[1:42:16] it's a son of god
[1:42:18] we're no longer covered over by darkness
[1:42:22] but it's in those moments where the
[1:42:23] greatness of his power
[1:42:25] displays that you know it's him
[1:42:29] and him alone amen what is that it's
[1:42:32] perfection
[1:42:34] it's no longer your struggle or my
[1:42:37] struggle
[1:42:38] it's no longer what i'm trying to do
[1:42:41] it's not even about how many days can i
[1:42:44] attach
[1:42:44] together oh my five days no
[1:42:48] this perfection goes beyond the keeping
[1:42:50] of days
[1:42:52] keeping of sabbaths and new moons it
[1:42:54] comes into a place
[1:42:56] to where our soul is in eternity
[1:42:59] body is still in time soul is in
[1:43:02] eternity
[1:43:03] body is still in time this is why the
[1:43:05] body can get sick
[1:43:06] but the soul that soul can no more die
[1:43:11] than god could die
[1:43:14] that soul is sealed away perfection
[1:43:17] listen you don't know sometimes the
[1:43:19] battles that i go through but if that
[1:43:21] perfection of his life is seated there
[1:43:24] it's not just that you're free from the
[1:43:26] desires of the world
[1:43:28] but it's where he is your
[1:43:31] life your desire
[1:43:35] is to please him amen as a matter of
[1:43:37] fact if something gets out of line or
[1:43:39] whatever you'll feel like what why don't
[1:43:41] seem like it just seems like something's
[1:43:42] missing you know what that is
[1:43:43] it's a spirit of god as it moves there
[1:43:46] in your life what's he doing he's
[1:43:47] calling you back because remember
[1:43:49] you shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:43:51] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:43:52] mouth of god
[1:43:53] we were not made to walk in this life
[1:43:55] and say well i'll just live things by my
[1:43:57] own life no
[1:43:58] we were made that our life might be
[1:43:59] regulated and under the control
[1:44:02] and the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:44:04] and this is where his grace
[1:44:06] comes in you see that's not our
[1:44:07] perfection if we look at it in terms of
[1:44:10] our perfection
[1:44:11] we would think man i never wrong i never
[1:44:13] have to be corrected no no
[1:44:14] it's the perfection of his life that
[1:44:16] will respond to the perfection
[1:44:18] of him who is the word because it is not
[1:44:21] the word and the spirit
[1:44:23] two separate things it is the word and
[1:44:25] the spirit wrapped up inside of you
[1:44:27] it is perfection his perfect
[1:44:31] life and if you don't have that this
[1:44:35] morning
[1:44:35] i'll tell you the whole the whole
[1:44:37] ministering of the word is an invitation
[1:44:40] for you to receive them we don't receive
[1:44:43] it by law
[1:44:44] it isn't it isn't a preacher saying i
[1:44:46] tell you you must receive
[1:44:48] the holy ghost jesus said you must be
[1:44:49] born again but it was not in a manner
[1:44:52] of that of law to where you come with
[1:44:54] the slave mentality
[1:44:55] he's letting it be known this is a
[1:44:57] necessary requirement
[1:44:58] for one to even see the kingdom of god
[1:45:00] for one to enter the kingdom of god
[1:45:02] but brother brown will tell us at the
[1:45:03] ending of the message of the token he
[1:45:05] said he comes in
[1:45:07] by love
[1:45:10] he said love brings courtship
[1:45:13] love brings marriage he said
[1:45:17] just as simple as this right here he
[1:45:19] said if you can just say
[1:45:21] from your heart lord he said
[1:45:24] i let everything of the world go but
[1:45:26] some of you understand i'm sitting in
[1:45:28] church right now
[1:45:29] look you could kick everything else out
[1:45:30] at home but if you don't kick it out
[1:45:31] here
[1:45:32] it'll come right back but right here the
[1:45:35] power of god is able to do a work here
[1:45:37] that when you get home what you have
[1:45:39] applied the word here it'll take care of
[1:45:41] itself at home
[1:45:42] it'll be right in line with what you
[1:45:44] have come in line with the word right
[1:45:45] here and falling in love with him bill
[1:45:47] brown said he comes in by love
[1:45:49] he said you make that that place and say
[1:45:51] lord i'm done with the unbelieving
[1:45:53] i apply the word to my life lord jesus
[1:45:57] i want you to have the preeminence i
[1:45:59] want you to have the center most seat in
[1:46:01] my life and brother braham says you
[1:46:02] watch
[1:46:03] he goes on to sing we love him because
[1:46:06] he first loved us
[1:46:07] he said you sense that sweet tender soft
[1:46:10] feeling coming into you right now that
[1:46:13] is
[1:46:13] the holy ghost
[1:46:16] what is it it's surrender in love
[1:46:21] where you come to the place to say this
[1:46:23] man
[1:46:25] love brings courtship into where you
[1:46:27] finally come to a place say
[1:46:30] i want to spend the rest of my life with
[1:46:32] this man
[1:46:34] the rest of my days matter of fact
[1:46:37] you know like my mom you know her my my
[1:46:40] my papo brown
[1:46:41] as she and my papa brown told my dad
[1:46:44] when they he was talking with them about
[1:46:45] getting married
[1:46:46] he told my dad he said is that the face
[1:46:48] you want to wake up and see every
[1:46:50] morning
[1:46:51] he said cause we don't believe in
[1:46:53] divorce
[1:46:58] see what courtship does it's him ruling
[1:47:00] to your heart
[1:47:02] he's one to your heart and you say it's
[1:47:04] the man i want to wake up and see every
[1:47:06] morning
[1:47:07] i want to see jesus when i wake up
[1:47:11] i want to see jesus through the day i
[1:47:14] want to see
[1:47:14] jesus at night i want to see jesus what
[1:47:17] is it
[1:47:18] it's the desire for union and when that
[1:47:21] union takes place oh sure there's tests
[1:47:23] there's trials there's disappointments
[1:47:25] bill abraham said he's broken my heart
[1:47:27] many times but i love
[1:47:31] him for it
[1:47:36] it's where he seats in perfection
[1:47:41] don't you love him let's go our heads
[1:47:50] i'm going to pray we're going to pray
[1:47:52] together
[1:47:56] god knows your need he knows your heart
[1:47:58] but we realize this service we're not
[1:47:59] just
[1:48:00] it's not just been a service that we
[1:48:01] come to like it's not
[1:48:03] no service we come to just to come to
[1:48:05] fulfill time
[1:48:06] but god would speak to our hearts if
[1:48:09] that would be your earnest request today
[1:48:13] just let it be known to the lord maybe
[1:48:15] there's another need upon your heart
[1:48:17] maybe a need upon your heart to say lord
[1:48:20] help me lord jesus help me to be more
[1:48:23] insensitive maybe there's something
[1:48:24] where you've kind of
[1:48:25] went astray not that you went out into
[1:48:27] the world but maybe there's things that
[1:48:29] got kind of off target in your life you
[1:48:30] got a little cool
[1:48:32] you got a little cold and then the enemy
[1:48:34] slips in and starts condemning you and
[1:48:36] pointing out every kind of accusation
[1:48:40] listen what should i do i'll tell you
[1:48:42] what the word invites us to do
[1:48:43] he said if we confess our sin he's
[1:48:45] faithful and just to forgive us
[1:48:48] the bible points out that we have an
[1:48:49] advocate with the father jesus christ
[1:48:51] the righteous
[1:48:52] he is the prophetion for our sins and
[1:48:54] not our sins only but the sins of the
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:58] world
[1:49:00] i wonder how many would like to be
