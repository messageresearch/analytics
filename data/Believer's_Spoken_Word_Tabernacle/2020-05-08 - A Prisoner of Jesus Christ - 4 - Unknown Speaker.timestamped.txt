[29:10] witnesses of that Lord and this is our
[29:14] desire that you would just come Lord
[29:16] fulfill your word minister to our lives
[29:20] now Lord we pray in a personal way in
[29:23] the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen
[29:28] amen god bless you tonight we want to
[29:31] just invite you into the scriptures
[29:33] there too
[29:36] Philippians chapter 1 and verse 18 and
[29:39] I'm just going to read just a few verses
[29:41] of Scripture and then we will let you
[29:45] have your seats
[29:47] and we just certainly just looking to
[29:51] the Lord for his
[29:53] mercy and His grace we want to look here
[29:59] back in the scriptures tonight into
[30:01] verse 18 of Philippians 1 and here are
[30:07] Paul writes now remember what we're we
[30:10] were looking at this last week Paul is
[30:12] coming out of where he is it let them
[30:16] know that there is the gospel or Christ
[30:21] is being preached but there are
[30:24] different motives and objectives that
[30:27] are even behind and the governing of
[30:30] Christ being preached but I believe that
[30:33] within this scripture here we could just
[30:35] take this scripture and just just preach
[30:37] on the rest of God because the reality
[30:40] is when Paul when we look at how Paul's
[30:43] response is to this it was not something
[30:45] that was lacks it was not something that
[30:49] Paul just said oh well we'll just let it
[30:51] blow over but you know in every
[30:53] situation the the pattern that we have
[30:57] there's many patterns that we are a
[30:59] pattern that we have as believer but you
[31:01] know we we look for the unction of the
[31:04] Holy Spirit it's not just to do
[31:07] something because this was done before
[31:08] but you realized that in this particular
[31:11] thing right here where Paul is writing
[31:13] Paul is not worried and he's not anxious
[31:16] that to me when I think of it in terms
[31:19] of being a minister of the gospel this
[31:21] is a messenger of the age but look what
[31:23] rests that he had he had such rest for
[31:28] he said what then notwithstanding every
[31:31] way whether in pretence or in truth
[31:35] Christ is preached and I therein do
[31:40] rejoice yay and will rejoice may God
[31:47] bless you bless the reading of the word
[31:48] as you're being seated tonight
[31:50] I in looking at this here there are
[31:54] things that we see in the other epistles
[31:58] as well as what will come out here even
[32:01] within that in the in the letter to the
[32:04] Philippians a church where Paul will
[32:08] deal with those and dealing primarily
[32:11] with looking at the objectives and the
[32:15] motives that are different then what the
[32:18] real objective that Christ sets in the
[32:21] heart of a believer and this is why over
[32:24] and over we we must have the discernment
[32:27] of the Holy Spirit this is why we cannot
[32:30] just judge by outward appearance we
[32:33] cannot even just judge by a person's
[32:35] speech but you see the thing of it is
[32:38] neither does it cause us or is God
[32:41] saying to us be tense about it and
[32:44] second-guess everybody because remember
[32:47] you can be so conservative that you can
[32:50] grieve the Holy Ghost so what does that
[32:52] mean it means don't have any confidence
[32:55] in our flesh but knowing this right here
[32:59] that God is leading and directing our
[33:02] life and surely we are trusting in the
[33:05] Lord that God will open and reveal those
[33:08] things to us if there's anything out of
[33:10] line this is the rest that I believe
[33:12] that Paul here is he's speaking of this
[33:14] in verse 18 the approach that Paul has
[33:18] taken and I tell you we need the wisdom
[33:20] of the Holy Spirit in every situation on
[33:23] how to approach every situation whether
[33:25] it's in the family whether it's in the
[33:27] church how do we approach it there's
[33:29] times that when as you know we've looked
[33:32] at this
[33:33] there are times with under even in every
[33:35] marriage and every church and every life
[33:37] you operate under the under the
[33:40] anointing of the Holy Spirit but the
[33:41] four characteristics of lion that of ox
[33:45] that of man that of Eagle there's times
[33:47] we we need with a boldness to stand
[33:50] there and roar like a lion then there's
[33:53] other times we need to have that of the
[33:55] Ox where we lay down our will lay down
[33:58] our opinion lay down this we have to
[34:00] have that sacrificial part of an ox
[34:03] there's other times
[34:04] we need that of the man wise as a
[34:06] serpent harmless as a dove be slow to
[34:08] speak swift to hear there's other times
[34:11] when we need that of that of the Eagle
[34:14] where there is a catching away where
[34:16] there's a moving if there is a
[34:18] translating that takes place the power
[34:20] of God comes on the scene right there to
[34:23] be able to govern that situation to
[34:26] govern our lives so in all things this
[34:28] is why I say that our confidence and our
[34:31] rest should be in the Lord and I don't
[34:34] believe that we should be anxious in any
[34:36] in anything the things that I believe
[34:40] that longer that we serve the Lord you
[34:42] begin to find more and more God is not
[34:45] looking to your eye that we would have
[34:47] to try to have all the answers for every
[34:50] situation but what's important is is
[34:53] that you are in contact and United with
[34:56] him who is the answer of all things
[34:58] because he will lead and guide it this
[35:00] was the promise he gave us he said I'll
[35:02] lead and guide you into all truth and so
[35:05] in situations arise we are looking to
[35:07] God for his wisdom and remember Paul
[35:10] even on his departure as we looked at
[35:13] last week when he would talk to those at
[35:15] Ephesus and let him know there are
[35:17] Grievous wolves that's going to enter
[35:19] him there are men that are going to rise
[35:21] up from among you speaking perverse
[35:22] things but notice Paul did not you know
[35:27] so focus around that he let him know
[35:30] this is what's going to be but in his
[35:33] departure he said I commend you to the
[35:35] word of grace which is able to build you
[35:37] up and he told the Cong he told the
[35:40] Brethren the elders this was the
[35:42] pastor's that he had gathered together
[35:44] there and how the Prophet had gathered
[35:46] those pastors and let him know take heed
[35:49] so now notice take heed this is what's
[35:52] going to take place but the way to
[35:54] combat this is that the people would be
[35:58] so place within Jesus Christ that's the
[36:02] combatant it isn't having the pastor on
[36:05] speed-dial
[36:06] it isn't having the pastor on your text
[36:08] thread or having him that he liked you
[36:10] your page on Facebook that's not the way
[36:13] we combat the enemy but remember to
[36:15] combat the enemy is to have the soul
[36:18] of the Holy Ghost on the inside of your
[36:21] life that you know and you're persuaded
[36:23] that he is able to keep that which you
[36:26] committed against that day we we we are
[36:29] to be soldiers in the army of Almighty
[36:33] God so the things that I'm looking at
[36:37] here is where that in in in in the
[36:41] scriptures of how that Paul is resting
[36:44] here in verse 18 in the situation that
[36:47] is taking place that regardless Paul's
[36:50] rejoicing that Christ is being preached
[36:52] now you know when I read the scripture
[36:55] even looking at it some you know weeks
[36:57] ago and and I thought about it we
[36:59] understand many times that there can be
[37:02] lives and different ones things that
[37:05] will come in among the message and we've
[37:07] seen it for years and you know as it
[37:11] would come in and sometimes where others
[37:13] have other objectives other than the
[37:15] real original jekt objective of Christ
[37:18] and yet you know sometimes you can see
[37:21] that where those spirits would come in
[37:23] and they want to be frak tisha s-- or
[37:25] divisive and you'll see it come in and
[37:28] there's many things that I have
[37:29] witnessed of different brothers and
[37:31] pastors where I've stood in their
[37:33] pulpits overseas to where that they
[37:36] would tell me after a time of how that
[37:38] there were you know pastors in the
[37:41] locality that would say don't go hear
[37:43] them don't go to their church they teach
[37:45] this and they teach that and they teach
[37:47] this and come to find out eventually
[37:49] those people they get they would start
[37:52] hearing the revelation of the word that
[37:55] was being preached and when they started
[37:57] hearing it there was something about it
[37:59] they said man this guy's not a devil
[38:01] what I'm here and this is truth man this
[38:05] is this is liberating it's setting me
[38:07] free you see what it comes down to do is
[38:10] that a sheep is always a sheep when they
[38:13] hear the voice of the Shepherd sounding
[38:16] in that clarity it's something about it
[38:18] that will ring in their heart and I
[38:20] believe that where Paul is standing in
[38:22] this moment here of verse 18 Paul is
[38:25] standing in a confidence that God has
[38:28] control in this situation Franklin
[38:31] there wasn't anything blow can do about
[38:33] it and let me just tell you something
[38:35] this is the life of a prisoner of Jesus
[38:38] Christ there is some sometimes we find
[38:42] ourselves trying to make things happen
[38:45] trying to solve problems and it isn't
[38:47] for us to solve them it's God is the one
[38:51] to solve them many times it's for us to
[38:54] wait in patience and look for the
[38:56] leadership of the Lord and waiting on
[38:58] him and sometimes that's very pressing
[39:01] because even within ourselves it's
[39:03] almost like we want to solve this or I
[39:05] want to solve this but God has
[39:07] everything in control oh my now notice
[39:13] how Paul takes this here let's look at
[39:15] this for a few moments in verse 19 Paul
[39:18] goes on to say for I know that this
[39:21] shall turn to my salvation through your
[39:25] prayer and the supply of the spirit of
[39:28] Jesus Christ according to my earnest
[39:31] expectation and my hope than in nothing
[39:36] I shall be ashamed nothing but that with
[39:42] all boldness as always so now also
[39:45] Christ shall be magnified in my body
[39:50] whether it be by life or by death look
[39:57] at this is a life when when we're
[39:59] looking at this remember this is a
[40:02] prison epistle and I don't mean to be
[40:04] redundant with that comment but I want
[40:07] you to understand there are things that
[40:09] are being even expressed here that we
[40:12] see in the life of Jesus Christ that
[40:14] exemplifies what it is to be a prisoner
[40:18] of Jesus Christ and this is where Paul
[40:22] what he's expressing is in his own life
[40:25] right here
[40:26] here was one think of Paul's life I like
[40:29] how brother branham goes through it he
[40:31] talks about his life remember he was a
[40:33] student of gamelon
[40:36] they didn't have student loans in that
[40:39] day his parents had to save in order to
[40:44] send him to study under Gamaliel
[40:47] there was a reason this was not daddy's
[40:50] ambition this was Paul's ambition and
[40:53] Paul had a desire one day that he was
[40:57] going to be high priest you see this is
[41:00] where a prophetic I can look down into
[41:03] the into these parts Paul had an
[41:05] ambition Paul had an objective let me
[41:07] just say it to you like this you would
[41:09] not have looked at Paul's life prior to
[41:12] his conversion and said that guy's a bum
[41:14] that had just floating around that guy's
[41:17] haphazard Paul's life one life that Paul
[41:20] had a centered life Paul's life was one
[41:24] that Paul if you talked to him he knew
[41:26] what he wanted in life Paul knew what he
[41:29] was after in life he had an objective
[41:31] there's nothing wrong with having an
[41:33] objective and a go let me just pause
[41:36] here a minute and preach a little bit we
[41:38] realized that we are living in the end
[41:40] time is that right we even see
[41:43] conditions that are upon the earth but
[41:45] let me just say this to you right now
[41:47] and I just feel pressed to say this to
[41:49] the young people those here and those
[41:51] watching I want you to understand this
[41:53] and catch this if if listen this message
[41:56] when God sent this message to you and I
[41:58] this message is an announcement this is
[42:02] the beginning of the end is that right
[42:05] we recognize what's going on but listen
[42:08] at the same time the balance within the
[42:11] message is how the unction would
[42:14] minister to us and say that if I knew
[42:17] Jesus was going to come in the morning I
[42:20] would prepare to preach the message that
[42:23] he laid on my heart what was the Prophet
[42:25] saying do not lay around and say well
[42:28] we're so close to the coming of the Lord
[42:30] I think I'll just you know kick my hands
[42:32] back what's the use of going to college
[42:33] what's the use of having an objective
[42:36] what's the use of prayer of what career
[42:38] that God would have for me what's the
[42:40] use of even looking at getting married
[42:42] no man knoweth the day nor the hour
[42:46] and I'll tell you right now there's been
[42:48] a lot and I'm not just going to say it
[42:50] was preachers there's been a lot of
[42:51] individuals that have taken hold of this
[42:54] message and instead of actually setting
[42:56] things in the right direction they did
[42:58] not hold a balanced I'm not criticizing
[43:00] him but I'm saying if there had actually
[43:03] been some more straightforward teaching
[43:05] and exhortation on this there's some
[43:07] people that wouldn't be in the mess that
[43:09] they're in tonight because there is a
[43:11] balance that comes with this word is
[43:14] that right there is a balance that comes
[43:17] with this think of this what if what if
[43:19] I in my heart what if my daddy had
[43:22] preached that what if he had labored on
[43:24] that at home and said hey son the coming
[43:26] of the Lord so close at hand you don't
[43:28] even need to go to school you don't even
[43:29] need to worry about this you don't even
[43:31] need to worry about that I'm gonna tell
[43:32] you right now and we'd have been in
[43:33] trouble now I know people always want to
[43:37] take more on unaware know where I'm
[43:38] going with this but I know people always
[43:40] want to take a quote and say well you
[43:41] know about the same my brother man told
[43:43] us about that woman you knowing that man
[43:45] in the boxcar
[43:46] I understand what he said but it's also
[43:48] the condition of times that was during
[43:50] the Depression
[43:51] you understand that the Prophet himself
[43:53] never ever told us not to get an
[43:56] education but he said don't let it be
[43:59] your God it's just like this man I could
[44:03] have studied a few more years I would
[44:05] have been a PhD had a PhD a doctorate in
[44:08] administration but you know it was still
[44:10] if I would have had a PhD as I have a
[44:12] master's disease I do not understand God
[44:15] but my master's degree or my bachelor's
[44:18] degree I do not find the leadership of
[44:20] the Holy Ghost because of my knowledge
[44:23] within this of earthly things those are
[44:26] things that God has allowed me in order
[44:29] to provide for myself and to my part in
[44:33] the economy of God God already the
[44:36] college didn't put those skills in my
[44:38] life that God packed them in my life it
[44:41] was those things that had to be revealed
[44:44] that's right in the book of Exodus God
[44:46] does not put you here in this earth
[44:48] without packing skills in you when you
[44:51] come here for them to be unpacked that
[44:54] was three so you say but the same no
[44:57] what are you saying I'm saying
[44:59] now to have a clear objective Paul had
[45:02] an ambition he had an objective he had a
[45:04] will he had something that he was
[45:06] driving the only thing of it is is that
[45:09] what Paul was after in that he was
[45:12] wanting to serve God but he just wasn't
[45:14] taking the right Avenue and God had to
[45:17] help him because knowing Paul's heart
[45:19] that Paul's heart's desire was to serve
[45:22] the god of his father's but yet the
[45:24] Avenue or the pathway he was going it
[45:27] would never be able to actually satisfy
[45:30] the thirst that was down there but God
[45:32] in His mercy because it was not us that
[45:35] found God it was God that comes
[45:37] searching for us so God came right down
[45:39] there and he moved upon Paul's life one
[45:42] who was filled with ambition had
[45:45] objectives
[45:46] he had his will it was set but what he
[45:48] met that day on the road to Damascus it
[45:51] cost him to put a pause on everything
[45:55] else
[45:56] he had Paul said at that point in time
[45:58] Paul said you know what I'm gonna put a
[46:00] pause on this courtship I'm gonna put a
[46:02] pause on you understand what I'm saying
[46:03] Paul put a pause on so many other things
[46:06] why because he knew there was something
[46:10] that he had meant he had met the Lord on
[46:12] the road to Damascus and Paul did not
[46:15] start out that very moment saying hey I
[46:17] met the Lord I met the Lord no he went
[46:20] and studied for three years you see what
[46:23] you find in the life of a prisoner is a
[46:26] life that seeks to be grounded in Jesus
[46:30] Christ that's a real blessing that's the
[46:32] reality that every one of us must have
[46:34] is that grounding that solid mist that
[46:37] plays where you can put your foot on
[46:39] that you know what you're talking about
[46:41] Paul did not just take an experience and
[46:44] go by and experience you see this is
[46:47] where that every ministry is to be
[46:49] paralleled after the pattern that God
[46:52] set with Paul that is why that the
[46:54] prophet of God under inspiration in this
[46:57] hour wouldn't reach clear back there in
[46:59] that rebuilding of the temple and he
[47:01] would liken it to that as Aruba mo
[47:03] remember zerubabbel is one that would
[47:05] hold the plumb line zerubabbel is one
[47:08] that had the
[47:09] measurements that was there spiritually
[47:11] speaking here to understand that in
[47:14] order for Christ Himself to come and
[47:16] dwell in the midst of a people it must
[47:19] be a body that is God constructed in
[47:22] order for Noah in order to say to move
[47:25] above the judgment waters it was not
[47:28] just any boat would do it was not just
[47:30] any boat it had to be a God constructed
[47:34] pull of a pattern that was spiritually
[47:37] revealed to Noah so notice we're polar
[47:40] Paul is that Paul actually loosened
[47:43] listen to me now the authority of the
[47:46] revelation that had come to Paul
[47:48] actually gave him the authority Hogue
[47:51] glory be to God what he met on the road
[47:54] to Damascus it gave Paul authority to
[47:57] loosen himself from every ambition and
[48:01] instead Paul was united with this
[48:05] revelation of the love of God in his
[48:07] heart brother you couldn't get this
[48:09] revelation out of his heart it begins to
[48:12] display itself in the life of Paul it's
[48:16] what caused Paul to forsake all of the
[48:19] teaching that he had his degrees all of
[48:21] his learning it was that where Paul was
[48:24] a smart man Paul could speak in many
[48:26] different languages and yet Paul look at
[48:28] the humility of Christ that has moved in
[48:31] a man that could speak such eloquent
[48:33] words words of wisdom but yet Paul when
[48:36] he said when I come among you I do not
[48:38] want to speak any of these other unknown
[48:41] tongues I could speak in ten thousand
[48:43] tongues but yet what would it profit you
[48:46] but except that I would speak that you
[48:49] might have understanding what did that
[48:51] it was the humility of Christ that Paul
[48:54] was yoked to he had become a prisoner oh
[48:59] what a wonderful thing it is to be a
[49:02] prisoner of Jesus Christ
[49:05] well in that Paul would write whether I
[49:08] live or whether I die we know for a
[49:10] Christian you can't die once you've died
[49:13] you've already died all death does is
[49:15] pack you're right into the presence of
[49:16] God but Paul here's here's Paul's
[49:19] determination but I'm not going to be
[49:21] ashame
[49:21] I'm expecting deliverance let me just
[49:24] tell you something right now if you get
[49:26] sick if anybody was to get sick at all
[49:29] you have every right as a matter of fact
[49:32] you've got a charge from the Word of God
[49:34] to expect healing because it is packed
[49:38] from full of healing and if you are a
[49:41] member of the body of Jesus Christ by
[49:44] the Spirit of God you've got a right to
[49:46] stand there on those Covenant promises
[49:49] and claim what belongs to you
[49:51] Paul had every right right here to say
[49:53] according to my earnest expectation and
[49:55] my hope that I'm gonna be delivered I'm
[49:58] gonna be set free I'm gonna be delivered
[50:01] back to you all Paul was not talking
[50:03] down in the glooms
[50:04] although no doubt he had certain days
[50:07] when he was there that might have been
[50:09] down days and up days and down days just
[50:16] like you and me but once again that's
[50:19] the life of a prisoner reminds us of
[50:21] this prison cell that were still in now
[50:27] look how Paul would go on to right here
[50:29] in the in the book of Philippians in the
[50:32] same chapter and I want you to notice
[50:35] the same perseverance the same
[50:37] persistence the same determination that
[50:41] Paul had even in a situation that Paul
[50:44] did not know how it was going to come
[50:46] out Paul did not know when he wrote that
[50:48] then I'm gonna be delivered or I'm gonna
[50:50] be coming back to you all
[50:51] or I'm Paul didn't know that but his
[50:53] expectation was I'm gonna expect
[50:55] deliverance why should not you see even
[51:00] when Paul was in the ship prior to this
[51:03] remember it looked like all hope was
[51:05] lost but the angel of the Lord showed up
[51:08] right because remember why the purpose
[51:11] of God was not finished in Paul's life
[51:15] now notice this here in verse 21 or if
[51:19] we could just keep that in mind tonight
[51:20] in our lives it doesn't cause us to act
[51:23] foolish but is to understand it helps us
[51:25] so you're not walking in fear that
[51:28] there's absolutely nothing can take you
[51:30] I don't care what new virus comes out I
[51:32] don't care what no do not
[51:34] disease come along there is nothing that
[51:36] can stop the perfect plan of Almighty
[51:39] God there's not anybody that God says
[51:42] oops uh uh huh you know I wasn't
[51:44] expecting this is gonna take them off
[51:46] the scene it does not make us act
[51:48] foolishly but it does as we are going
[51:51] about and doing the things that are
[51:53] right it gives us a confidence as it
[51:55] should even when you get behind your car
[51:57] or you're getting the airplane wherever
[52:00] you go you need to have that kind of an
[52:02] assurance that I'm not going anywhere
[52:05] until God is finished with me and just
[52:11] hand the devil that fear say here you
[52:13] can take this this come from you
[52:14] this ain't from the kingdom that I'm
[52:16] born from you can take it I don't need
[52:18] it because then ain't serving me well
[52:20] verse 21 for to me to live is Christ
[52:29] you know Paul was saying if I get out of
[52:31] this prison I'll live
[52:33] it's Christ
[52:39] see this is where that motives and
[52:42] objectives the Spirit of God will search
[52:44] ran around in a service and brother
[52:48] Branham would take us right in the
[52:49] message I've heard that now I see he
[52:51] said when many people want to get well
[52:53] but why do you want God to heal you he
[52:58] said do you want God to heal you so you
[53:00] can keep on doing the same thing
[53:03] or what is your motive and objective in
[53:07] it is your motive and objective to
[53:10] glorify Him to say God I'm on my whole
[53:13] life to be healed not just my body I
[53:16] want myself to be healed now listen your
[53:19] soul might be right in step with God but
[53:22] why do you want healed do you want
[53:24] healed to say Lord I want to lay before
[53:26] you I want to be able Lord to give more
[53:30] of myself to you you see there's got to
[53:33] be a right motive and objective if there
[53:36] is not the right motive and objective
[53:38] then we cannot have faith the Bible said
[53:42] if our heart condemn us we can't have
[53:45] confidence this is part of our prayer in
[53:48] order for faith to have a channel to
[53:51] operate by it must be by the right
[53:53] motive and right objective so Paul was
[53:56] saying for me to live is Christ and to
[53:59] die is gain I'm not losing but if I live
[54:05] in the flesh don't you just love how
[54:10] Paul talks about it Paul Paul talks
[54:13] about the flesh the way that I would
[54:14] look at my coat and Paul just says if I
[54:16] live in this you see once I'm once this
[54:18] thing is hung up right here this coat is
[54:21] not me the real me is beneath that coat
[54:23] and Paul said if it's if it's needful if
[54:26] I'm gonna live in this flesh look if I
[54:28] live in this flesh this is the fruit of
[54:31] my labor what's going to be my fruit
[54:33] Christ what's going to be the fruit of
[54:36] my life this is where Paul is determined
[54:40] yet what I shall choose I want not all
[54:45] said I don't know what to choose
[54:47] for i am in a strait betwixt two having
[54:50] a desire to depart and to be with Christ
[54:54] which is far better nevertheless to
[54:58] abide in the flesh is more needful for
[55:01] you this is a prisoner it would be
[55:05] easier for Paul to say Lord take me on
[55:08] home
[55:09] you remember brother ban him in the
[55:12] adoption series he began he was talking
[55:15] you know in that way and he said the
[55:17] Holy Spirit spoke to him and his brother
[55:19] man was talking about Lord these trials
[55:22] are so hard these tests are so hard and
[55:24] he said when he begin to go on like that
[55:26] I'm just one man I want to go on home
[55:28] Lord and he said the Spirit of God spoke
[55:30] to him and said are you trying to bypass
[55:33] them death is not to bypass problems the
[55:38] death of a believer is that of a
[55:41] graduation
[55:43] it's a saint of God that has overcome
[55:47] and it manifests and and fulfill the
[55:50] purpose of God and now there is a
[55:52] graduating from this life into that
[55:56] where they've lived from and for
[56:01] nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
[56:04] more needful for you and having this
[56:09] confidence I know that I shall abide and
[56:13] continue with you all for your
[56:16] furtherance and joy of faith so why what
[56:22] what is it that the desire to abide is
[56:24] for the furtherance of your joy of faith
[56:29] glory that your rejoicing may be more
[56:33] abundant in Jesus class for me by my
[56:36] coming to you again look where the fault
[56:39] is that here is a man who is in bonds
[56:41] he's chained has a soldier right there
[56:44] in his hired house and here who's he
[56:47] thinking about who's he praying about
[56:49] even within this first chapter
[56:51] Philippians it has nothing to do with
[56:53] himself even the decision I don't even
[56:56] know what decision to make to go on with
[56:59] the Lord or to stay here for you
[57:01] but as he moves around to it the
[57:03] decision is always about what is the
[57:06] most going to be the most beneficial for
[57:08] you the body of Jesus Christ you see
[57:14] this is what the revelation of Jesus
[57:16] Christ does it puts the burden and the
[57:20] love of God and it reveals the mystery
[57:23] of the body of Jesus Christ because the
[57:26] body of Jesus Christ is not a church
[57:28] building the body of Jesus Christ is not
[57:31] even a group of people the body of Jesus
[57:34] Christ is the mystical body that is made
[57:38] up of spirit born filled believers that
[57:43] are under the blood of the Lamb there
[57:46] has to be an induction into that body by
[57:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:52] just being baptized in the name of the
[57:55] Lord Jesus Christ does not in-depth you
[57:58] into the body of Jesus Christ you are
[58:02] there confessing your sins you've come
[58:04] into fellowship with the believers with
[58:06] the Saints but remember there's got to
[58:09] be an induction you have been baptized
[58:12] identified with your sacrifice and then
[58:15] looking to that of the sanctifying power
[58:18] that's in the blood to remove all the
[58:21] desires and habits uncleanliness out of
[58:24] your life why what's the objective is
[58:26] because I want to be baptized into the
[58:29] body of Jesus Christ man can baptize you
[58:33] with their they'll put you down in the
[58:35] water but it takes the Spirit of God to
[58:37] put you in the body of Jesus Christ you
[58:41] see here's a choice and you know when
[58:45] when we've been redeemed we no longer on
[58:48] our own choice
[58:51] Christ is our choice now I want to just
[58:55] just labor here just a few moments in
[58:59] this verse of scripture that we're
[59:01] looking at because the theme continues
[59:04] on in this of a prisoner Jesus Christ
[59:07] you recognize that as we look here in
[59:12] the scripture Paul admonishes now notice
[59:15] how he spoke of the things that are
[59:18] going on now he turns his attention and
[59:20] he's addressing to the body of Jesus
[59:23] Christ with that same persistence he
[59:26] says only let your conversation that
[59:29] means your life your life reflects what
[59:33] you are a citizen of that's what it's
[59:36] talking about your conversation only let
[59:40] your conversation be as it becomes the
[59:43] gospel of Christ but whether I come and
[59:46] see you or else be absent I may hear of
[59:50] your affairs so there is a life that is
[59:54] being lived and on display remember Paul
[59:57] when Paul would stand there before
[1:00:00] Ananias remember Paul would have a
[1:00:03] testimony that is that ball could write
[1:00:06] of how that I have lived in all good
[1:00:09] conscience before God until this day
[1:00:13] that's a powerful thing because it's one
[1:00:17] thing to be before people but here was a
[1:00:21] testimony Paul could say before God you
[1:00:25] see it's one thing because man's eyes
[1:00:27] could see one thing remember there were
[1:00:30] even those in the Corinthian time that
[1:00:32] in the book of Corinthians that were
[1:00:34] writing you know my they were reading
[1:00:36] Paul's letter remember they were writing
[1:00:37] man this guy's a mighty man wow man
[1:00:40] he must be quite a speaker quite a man
[1:00:43] in stature Paul shows up and you know
[1:00:45] what they're there and their complaint
[1:00:46] is that said the man is Madi and speech
[1:00:48] but his looks are contemptible is that
[1:00:52] right and what did Paul say Paul's
[1:00:54] addressed to that within those things as
[1:00:57] he said we'll see when I come who is
[1:00:59] mighty
[1:01:01] now Paul listen Paul was not being you
[1:01:04] know aggressive what Paul's really
[1:01:07] attention to the church he said the
[1:01:09] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[1:01:11] what was he doing he was trying to let
[1:01:14] the people see that it is not the size
[1:01:16] of a man
[1:01:18] it's the size of Christ in that man go
[1:01:22] look on the stature of man Samuel almost
[1:01:27] a night that the wrong one to be king
[1:01:30] close he was looking on the stature of
[1:01:32] man to know somebody he was still under
[1:01:35] that kind of an influence and that kind
[1:01:38] of a thinking but all my by being a
[1:01:40] prophet of God he was separated under
[1:01:43] the Lord and the Holy Spirit could speak
[1:01:46] to him and say not him not him not him
[1:01:49] Samuel thought it was this is surely the
[1:01:51] one this is surely the one this is
[1:01:53] surely the one what was it it wasn't
[1:01:55] that Samuel got this one wrong or that
[1:01:57] went wrong or that went wrong that's not
[1:01:59] what the focus is the focus is that even
[1:02:02] when Samuels thoughts were inclined a
[1:02:04] certain way he allowed his thoughts to
[1:02:08] be overrode by the mind of Christ
[1:02:10] brother that's what a real prisoner is
[1:02:13] that allows our mind to be overrode by
[1:02:18] the mind of Christ and so Paul he would
[1:02:22] Paul would have a life we would see that
[1:02:24] would be a life he Paul would ride in
[1:02:26] gang you know he would call the witness
[1:02:28] among the Thessalonians among the
[1:02:30] Corinthians there in 2nd Corinthians 4
[1:02:33] in different places Paul even in
[1:02:35] Galatians Paul would call the attention
[1:02:38] of the believers to the life that was
[1:02:41] lived before him even of how he would
[1:02:45] say to the Thessalonians he said you
[1:02:47] seen how when we come among you we were
[1:02:50] as a nurse with children what was he
[1:02:53] saying we took you and nourished you
[1:02:56] nursed you has upon the sincere milk of
[1:02:59] the word to do what that you might come
[1:03:02] to a place of maturity in your walking
[1:03:06] in your life there is a goal and a focus
[1:03:08] within the gospel
[1:03:14] well may God help me to make this clear
[1:03:16] tonight notice he said this is what this
[1:03:21] is a conversation that become at the
[1:03:23] gospel of Christ that I want to be able
[1:03:27] to hear that you stand fast that means
[1:03:30] you're persistent you're standing firm
[1:03:34] you're persevering in one spirit with
[1:03:41] one mind striving together not at one
[1:03:45] another striving together for the faith
[1:03:49] of the gospel that's first what's Paul
[1:03:53] doing he's letting them know this is the
[1:03:55] objective that's been the objective of
[1:03:58] his ministry Jesus Christ the same
[1:04:01] yesterday today and forever me just tell
[1:04:05] you something that is not just a words
[1:04:09] from a scripture on a tape case that is
[1:04:12] to be the insignia and inscription on
[1:04:16] our hearts in our homes in our lives
[1:04:18] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:04:21] today and forever glory that you stand
[1:04:28] fast
[1:04:30] Nepal would admonish in many places
[1:04:32] about standing fast
[1:04:35] but you realize but the random wouldn't
[1:04:39] read it like this because look standing
[1:04:41] fast in one spirit
[1:04:44] right here among us just with a little
[1:04:48] handful of people that's here that's
[1:04:50] been man in the battle stations from the
[1:04:52] beginning just that just the 8 of us
[1:04:55] that's been here including myself listen
[1:04:58] we all have different makeups we all
[1:05:03] within listen our human spirit were
[1:05:06] different Paul is not talking about
[1:05:09] human spirit and not simple he's talking
[1:05:14] about one spirit this is where you're
[1:05:18] standing in that of one spirit with one
[1:05:22] mind one objective it is the faith not a
[1:05:26] faith but the faith of Christ and I tell
[1:05:30] you what brother man it would put it
[1:05:32] just like this in the Queen of Sheba he
[1:05:34] said it takes more than the power of
[1:05:36] gifts it takes more than joining a
[1:05:41] church come on somebody it takes more
[1:05:45] than that it takes the birth of the Holy
[1:05:48] Spirit to break down our walls and to
[1:05:51] unite us together as one great Christian
[1:05:55] body moving for one objective and one go
[1:06:03] we can come and sit right here and not
[1:06:05] be one we can come and sit right here
[1:06:11] and not be one let me just put it to you
[1:06:13] very clear we can come and sit here and
[1:06:15] we within ourselves can be in one mind
[1:06:19] in one Accord and we're stealing one
[1:06:21] whoo they went into the upper room the
[1:06:26] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:06:29] assembled them according to the promise
[1:06:32] but they had to go get what the promised
[1:06:35] promised to them you with me
[1:06:40] it had to come to a place to where they
[1:06:43] would be one with him this is the
[1:06:50] objective of the gospel anything outside
[1:06:53] of that is nothing less than membership
[1:06:57] it's all it is and you know what
[1:07:00] it displays itself but so does the
[1:07:04] genuine birth display itself as well
[1:07:09] Oh Simon what are you talking about I'm
[1:07:11] talking about heartfelt religion that's
[1:07:14] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:07:17] hearts that got Jesus Christ beaten on
[1:07:20] the inside where Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:23] objective of that life that's what I'm
[1:07:26] talking about Paul was talking about
[1:07:28] standing fast in one spirit this is what
[1:07:32] Paul was talking about remember there
[1:07:34] was intercessory prayer that was made
[1:07:36] and I just have to refer to this Jesus
[1:07:39] remember in John 17 as he is praying
[1:07:42] he's praying as he says in verse 20
[1:07:46] neither pray I for these alone but for
[1:07:48] them also which shall believe on me
[1:07:50] through their word that they may be one
[1:07:52] as thou father art in me and I am V that
[1:07:57] they also may be one in us notice the
[1:08:00] oneness as thou father art in me and I
[1:08:06] am in thee you see the father listen to
[1:08:12] me now Jesus was always the word but
[1:08:18] when he received the spirit when the
[1:08:21] father came in him what did it do it
[1:08:25] quickened the word that was laying there
[1:08:27] and it put him in the word the word was
[1:08:31] no longer letter the word was made flesh
[1:08:36] that's what the Holy Ghost does in the
[1:08:39] heart of a believer
[1:08:40] it makes the word flesh that's the real
[1:08:46] oneness outside of that it's not oneness
[1:08:53] the disciples walk with Jesus this with
[1:08:56] Jesus talked with Jesus maybe covered
[1:08:59] him up when he laid on the boat but they
[1:09:01] want one you can come to this church you
[1:09:06] can do everything in the world I trying
[1:09:08] to discourage nobody I'm trying to tell
[1:09:10] you don't let the devil rob you of what
[1:09:13] God's desire is you understand fast in
[1:09:17] one spear
[1:09:19] take your inheritance the Holy Ghost
[1:09:25] belongs to me hallelujah the glory which
[1:09:37] thou gave us me I have given them that
[1:09:39] they may be one even as we are one I am
[1:09:43] them notice I am them and thou in me
[1:09:46] that they may be made perfect in one
[1:09:51] this is the completion that the world
[1:09:54] may know notice that the world may know
[1:09:56] that thou has sent me and has to love
[1:10:00] them as thou has loved me the reflection
[1:10:06] of the unity of Jesus Christ in the life
[1:10:09] of a believer let me just say this to
[1:10:11] you this body belongs to you
[1:10:16] I'm quoting without reading it directly
[1:10:18] this body belongs to you but the heart
[1:10:21] is to belong to God the heart is the
[1:10:25] control tower of man that's where God
[1:10:29] brings the headship of his word listen
[1:10:32] this flesh in itself ken is not a place
[1:10:35] to receive the headship of the word I'm
[1:10:37] talking about the flesh the spirit all
[1:10:41] that that makes up it's got to come to
[1:10:43] the heart let me tell you something it
[1:10:47] can it can fall in many different places
[1:10:50] but if it's no more than just an
[1:10:52] acknowledgment of truth if it's no more
[1:10:55] than just a membership then that is not
[1:10:58] what Paul is talking about and maybe you
[1:11:00] say it right up front don't let the
[1:11:03] devil give you any excuse don't even
[1:11:06] don't even take his excuse well brother
[1:11:08] Samuel I don't understand that the
[1:11:10] reason the reason that you can't
[1:11:13] understand it is because you've got to
[1:11:15] be born of the Holy Ghost when you're
[1:11:18] bone of the Spirit of God in the eyes of
[1:11:21] your heart become a 9 10 then you can
[1:11:25] see the kingdom of God
[1:11:26] then you see the plan of God then you
[1:11:29] see the program of God if not if not
[1:11:33] this church is no more to you than just
[1:11:37] a social gathering come on somebody
[1:11:44] those are in your home's you ought to be
[1:11:46] shot in your shoe heels off these are
[1:11:48] promises that God has given to us what
[1:11:52] good would it do to have a whole
[1:11:54] congregation 1 and here we are one and
[1:11:57] yet lacking the real objective in hearts
[1:11:59] and lives who sent me one who's saying
[1:12:03] I'm telling you it goes beyond I and I
[1:12:05] admonish and I agree if the love of
[1:12:08] God's in your heart you ought to be in
[1:12:09] the house of God but let me tell you
[1:12:11] something it is something more than just
[1:12:14] faithful church attendance you've got to
[1:12:18] have a meeting with Jesus Christ to
[1:12:21] where you have got the overcomer
[1:12:24] the inside and you have received the
[1:12:27] strength of an overcomer and been you're
[1:12:30] an overcomer it causes you to be
[1:12:35] persistent for what the objective of
[1:12:39] Jesus Christ devil can try to try to
[1:12:43] sidetrack you here sad track aver
[1:12:45] sidetrack you there but you're standing
[1:12:47] fast in what spirit one mind striving
[1:12:51] for the faith of Christ reminds you the
[1:12:56] Bible says in the last days Paul would
[1:13:02] write of it how peerless times would
[1:13:04] come men would be lovers of their own
[1:13:07] selves he would also talk about that men
[1:13:11] like Janice and Jen Rees he talked about
[1:13:15] how they would you know come in they
[1:13:17] would creep into houses and lead silly
[1:13:20] women laden with divers lust
[1:13:23] you know he's dealing with and Jenny's
[1:13:26] and danbury's are anointed preachers the
[1:13:30] Prophet tells us very clearly in Christ
[1:13:32] the mystery he said they can build a
[1:13:33] church brother they can get a group of
[1:13:36] people together come on now you see
[1:13:38] they've got charisma
[1:13:40] they've got pull to get a group of
[1:13:42] people together let me just drop this
[1:13:43] into you real quick I believe that this
[1:13:46] is one of the things that why it's
[1:13:48] necessary that we have to have the
[1:13:50] leadership of the Holy Spirit because it
[1:13:52] does take the Holy Ghost to keep a group
[1:13:55] of people in harmony in United and look
[1:13:58] into the objective of Jesus Christ but
[1:14:01] we don't need individuals coming
[1:14:03] together and just trying to keep a group
[1:14:06] of people together we need the Holy
[1:14:08] Spirit in the midst of his children
[1:14:11] leading his church on in the promise of
[1:14:13] Almighty God
[1:14:14] that's why brother Graham said a man
[1:14:16] ought to have an absolute and he brings
[1:14:19] that absolute over the congregation and
[1:14:22] he says he preaches that absolute still
[1:14:25] every member comes in step with that
[1:14:28] word but the sudden you keep preaching
[1:14:32] the same thing if you miss the life you
[1:14:35] miss it all
[1:14:37] and how much knowledge you have if you
[1:14:40] miss it every lesson on a point out the
[1:14:44] life of Jesus Christ every message ought
[1:14:47] to bring conviction to hearts it ought
[1:14:51] to challenge us in our walk with God it
[1:14:57] becomes nothing more than forms of God
[1:15:01] forms of godliness but denying the power
[1:15:04] thereof
[1:15:14] that's why it takes more than just being
[1:15:16] associated with this a message that
[1:15:19] ain't the holy ghost
[1:15:23] but salmon I dress right I do this right
[1:15:26] it's deeper than that it's deeper than
[1:15:29] that
[1:15:31] well I know this and I know it's deeper
[1:15:33] than that you gotta have a revelation
[1:15:36] and a relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:15:41] to where you've got one objective let me
[1:15:44] just tell you something right now I
[1:15:45] don't care how Eva any of us are you
[1:15:48] might be look how brother man talks he
[1:15:49] told us in stature a perfect man he
[1:15:51] talked about all those virtues he said I
[1:15:54] know people with these virtues in a
[1:15:56] natural realm now what he said he said I
[1:15:59] know people with Tom what the statue of
[1:16:00] a perfect man he said I know people in
[1:16:02] the natural that have these virtues very
[1:16:05] patient very this very that but we're
[1:16:07] not talking about what's in the natural
[1:16:09] we're talking about what is spirit given
[1:16:13] spirit born and you know in those
[1:16:17] virtues display themselves when you're
[1:16:20] in the midst of trials that's when the
[1:16:23] life displays itself come on now because
[1:16:26] you just don't stand there and put out
[1:16:27] when you're on the mountaintop and say
[1:16:28] I'll put out a little bit of patience
[1:16:30] why do you need patience when you're on
[1:16:31] the mountaintop you need patience when
[1:16:33] you're in the valley fruit don't grow on
[1:16:36] the mountaintop fruit grows in the
[1:16:37] valley this is when the virtues come
[1:16:41] forth
[1:16:44] Oh glory be to God think of this now
[1:16:47] here you find that the people of God
[1:16:51] here they were gathered together after
[1:16:54] Pentecost
[1:16:56] they were brought together one mind one
[1:16:59] accord so that's very important you
[1:17:01] remember let me just say this to you let
[1:17:04] me just I want to say this just to
[1:17:05] settle that point even down further
[1:17:07] because it does matter that we are in
[1:17:10] one mind in one Accord that's why it's
[1:17:14] important that even when we come to the
[1:17:16] house of God that you get your mind
[1:17:20] together come on now
[1:17:22] just don't expect just to show up or
[1:17:25] when you sit down and watch your house
[1:17:27] and honey uh hem in the napkin I like my
[1:17:30] face your brother Samuel is now on the
[1:17:31] monitor you ought to get prepared come
[1:17:35] on now you ought to get prepared to say
[1:17:37] I'm coming to the table of the Lord
[1:17:41] [Applause]

[1:17:47] clear that when you're here let me just
[1:17:49] tell you something
[1:17:50] I I made across the table for many of
[1:17:53] you but even if you ain't Nate across
[1:17:54] him from me you know brother bill by
[1:17:56] looking at me when that guy goes to the
[1:17:57] table I know he means bidden I can tell
[1:17:59] by his stature
[1:18:02] and if you don't know my wife can tell
[1:18:04] you after breakfast I want to know
[1:18:06] what's coming for dinner
[1:18:11] I understand and this is what I'm trying
[1:18:15] to say it ought to be something clear in
[1:18:17] your life nobody gotta talk to you they
[1:18:20] ought to be able to see Jesus Christ
[1:18:22] here's the pulsation of your life my
[1:18:28] lord we might just we might have just
[1:18:32] eight people again next Thursday but
[1:18:40] this is the reality we need to be in one
[1:18:42] mind in one Accord yes sir
[1:18:44] amen to get into a place what so that
[1:18:47] the Holy Ghost can move among us mrs.
[1:18:51] Lyons and told us in greatest valor
[1:18:53] fault as he talks about the Stars how
[1:18:56] the unity with among them and then how
[1:18:58] it's reflected up in the earth he said
[1:18:59] if we can get in the Holy Spirit he said
[1:19:02] if the Holy Spirit can get this
[1:19:04] congregation this morning listen can get
[1:19:07] this congregation into one mind and one
[1:19:10] Accord in harmony he said they'll not be
[1:19:13] one person sitting here but what
[1:19:16] wouldn't be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:17] they're not me that's wanting it that's
[1:19:20] wanting it that's wanting it he said
[1:19:22] they'll not be one person that's sick in
[1:19:24] their body but what wouldn't be healed
[1:19:26] what is that that releases it it's being
[1:19:29] in harmony and unity with God or tell
[1:19:34] you it ought to be something about it
[1:19:36] that we ought to pinch ourselves and we
[1:19:38] ought to say Lord forgive me if I the
[1:19:41] coach coming to the house of God or
[1:19:43] every day if I've lived a haphazard
[1:19:45] Christian life you all repent and say
[1:19:48] God help me to live on more curve and
[1:19:51] focus dedicated ambitious filled life of
[1:19:55] Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] mother samuel that will make people want
[1:20:08] to come but it'll make the elect
[1:20:10] thankful to the lord because this is the
[1:20:13] desire of the let this is the desire of
[1:20:15] the believer
[1:20:16] oh glory one purpose you see god
[1:20:22] promised he would restore that bring it
[1:20:25] back to that real Pentecostal objective
[1:20:28] oh my this is where as the Scriptures it
[1:20:32] would admonish us here in in our walk
[1:20:35] with God notice how Paul would write let
[1:20:40] me just kind of bring this down in
[1:20:41] Colossians 3 just skip some in
[1:20:43] Colossians 3 verse 1
[1:20:46] look at this objective
[1:20:52] if you then be risen with Christ seek
[1:20:57] those things which are above where
[1:21:02] Christ sitteth on the right hand of God
[1:21:09] this is every promised
[1:21:11] he has ascended up and seated on the
[1:21:14] right hand of God this is the meta
[1:21:16] toriel seat this is the atonement come
[1:21:19] in to view it and unfolds to us these
[1:21:23] scriptures what rights what redemptive
[1:21:26] rights belong to us look at the
[1:21:29] admonition if you therefore be risen
[1:21:32] with Christ then seek those things which
[1:21:36] are above you see the Spirit of God
[1:21:37] listen friends the Spirit of God knows
[1:21:40] God knows this is why we need the
[1:21:43] admonition of the live Ministry of the
[1:21:46] word because you can't put you can't
[1:21:49] stop me you can't pause me
[1:21:51] you can't fast-forward me and you can't
[1:21:53] rewind me you can't do that because the
[1:21:58] Holy Spirit takes control and what does
[1:22:00] he do brother Graham tells us he comes
[1:22:02] along and as he begins to deliver that
[1:22:05] word he catches where we are over to
[1:22:08] where we need to be this is what /
[1:22:09] comings about he said he also catches
[1:22:12] our thinking where our thinking might be
[1:22:14] off a little bit and he said the
[1:22:16] preaching of the gospel will put our
[1:22:18] thinking back on Christ where it needs
[1:22:20] to be I don't know about you but I'm so
[1:22:22] thankful that many times where I've said
[1:22:24] I maybe I've been listening to a message
[1:22:26] or I've been sitting right here or been
[1:22:28] in other meetings and maybe there's
[1:22:30] things and I'm praying about maybe it's
[1:22:32] problems back here in the church maybe
[1:22:33] there's other situations I'm praying
[1:22:35] about how do I approach certain things
[1:22:37] even in in a personal life and family
[1:22:39] and other things and I'm waiting on the
[1:22:42] Lord but oh my and sometimes anybody
[1:22:44] ever got trapped in your own way of
[1:22:45] thinking here it seems like man I don't
[1:22:47] see any way out of this but along comes
[1:22:50] the Spirit of God he begins to break
[1:22:52] that word and you could have read that
[1:22:54] word and you didn't see that but
[1:22:56] immediately when the Spirit of God gets
[1:22:58] ahold of that word it's just like the
[1:23:00] Red Sea goes to pardon it's like the
[1:23:03] Jordan goes to opening and you begin to
[1:23:05] receive the dew and the sweetness of the
[1:23:08] honey from heaven and right there even
[1:23:11] though you got to face the problem but
[1:23:12] you've got assurances the thinking the
[1:23:16] mind of Christ has moved down and you
[1:23:18] like Samuel like Paul and like every the
[1:23:21] rest of them have a
[1:23:23] your mind to be overruled by the mind of
[1:23:26] Christ that's when the supernatural
[1:23:29] comes in seek those things which are
[1:23:36] above so it just shows us that this
[1:23:37] right here it's going to take some
[1:23:39] effort
[1:23:40] this is admonishing us seek those things
[1:23:42] which are above we walk in this life we
[1:23:48] live in this life we have things on our
[1:23:50] phone reminders send this bill out
[1:23:52] tomorrow reminder transfer this money
[1:23:55] tomorrow reminder do this oh yeah I got
[1:23:58] an appointment on my calendar we we have
[1:24:00] things to do in this life and yet we're
[1:24:02] admonished by the word that has poet
[1:24:05] admonished the Corinthians we've got to
[1:24:07] live in this world but they said don't
[1:24:08] abuse it live in but don't abuse it let
[1:24:13] Christ be the focus of your life set
[1:24:17] your affections on things above
[1:24:21] that's your thoughts your mind your
[1:24:25] focus not on things on the earth I want
[1:24:28] you to catch these scriptures right here
[1:24:30] these are not things that Jesus is going
[1:24:32] to do for us he won't do it for us he's
[1:24:36] already done for us what was needed now
[1:24:40] he speaks to us you set your affection
[1:24:44] on things above not on things on the
[1:24:47] earth immediately this is what we're
[1:24:53] talking about a life that is focused in
[1:24:55] on Christ
[1:24:58] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[1:25:02] with Christ in God what a paradox here
[1:25:07] we are brother bill dead hidden we are
[1:25:13] dead but yet we are alive in Christ
[1:25:18] when Christ's notice who is our life
[1:25:22] shall appear then shall ye also appear
[1:25:28] with him in glory
[1:25:32] not maybe not might happen not it's
[1:25:37] possible the guarantee is is because you
[1:25:41] already have this seal we already have
[1:25:44] the assurance but you see it calls us if
[1:25:48] the ofoh 'kiss has got a little off you
[1:25:51] see a prisoner of Jesus Christ is not
[1:25:54] altogether that someone that can't get
[1:25:57] out of focus or out of line but a
[1:26:01] prisoner of Jesus Christ is one when the
[1:26:04] Spirit of Christ God will make known and
[1:26:07] begin to deal with their heart by the
[1:26:08] word it might be something they don't
[1:26:10] even realize they've gone out of line or
[1:26:12] it might be something that they're
[1:26:13] praying and saying lord why is that it
[1:26:15] just seems like your presence is far
[1:26:16] from me it may not have been that you
[1:26:18] did anything it might just be God being
[1:26:20] silent about a time in your life to see
[1:26:22] how you're going to stand but you see a
[1:26:24] prisoner of God a prisoner of Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ is one who's able to be corrected
[1:26:30] it's one whose yoke the Spirit has yoked
[1:26:33] them into the word and they're able to
[1:26:35] be corrected let me just give you a few
[1:26:37] examples as I close here tonight we'll
[1:26:39] just stop here you think of those who
[1:26:41] are in the heroes in the Hall of Fame
[1:26:43] you think of that of Abraham you think
[1:26:46] of that of Noah you think of that of
[1:26:48] Enoch you think of all of those
[1:26:50] different ones even as the Bible can
[1:26:52] talk about in the book of Acts I love
[1:26:54] how it's wrote regarding David in the
[1:26:56] book of Acts it said Davis David served
[1:26:59] his generation by the will of the Lord
[1:27:02] he served his generation what was it he
[1:27:06] served the purpose the generation he was
[1:27:08] living in by the will of God by serving
[1:27:11] the will of God he served his generation
[1:27:14] how many of them Abraham Noah you think
[1:27:18] there were times that they got down
[1:27:19] there were times that they did go down
[1:27:21] but they did get down but notice what
[1:27:24] was the difference
[1:27:25] Christ was their life when it came down
[1:27:30] to certain things they had everything it
[1:27:32] was being funneled through Christ the
[1:27:34] revelation they had in their life
[1:27:37] they were as much as could be in that
[1:27:39] time under that allotted portion that
[1:27:42] they would have were the Spirit of God
[1:27:44] will move down
[1:27:45] on their lives they themselves were
[1:27:47] locked in to that revelation like Noah
[1:27:49] building the ark building there and
[1:27:52] laboring notice brother Branham would
[1:27:55] let us know he was not an engineer he
[1:27:57] was not an architect it would be like
[1:28:00] calling me to build a building but we'd
[1:28:02] be in trouble you and one asset under it
[1:28:03] much less stand near it
[1:28:06] but God God called somebody that did not
[1:28:09] have any abilities to do what he called
[1:28:11] him to do how many times we don't have
[1:28:15] it in the scripture where Noah got down
[1:28:17] and prayed said lord I don't know what
[1:28:20] to do here I don't know how to I don't
[1:28:23] know how to make these these ends meet
[1:28:24] right here I don't know how to bring
[1:28:26] this together Lord how do I do it
[1:28:29] it kept knowing listen the revelation
[1:28:32] was sure in his heart that's why he
[1:28:35] could pray the way he prayed same thing
[1:28:39] with Abraham same thing with the rest of
[1:28:41] them you see this is why Paul is
[1:28:44] admonishing the first admonishment he
[1:28:48] gives here to the people of God sister
[1:28:52] Roseanne go down to those last verse of
[1:28:55] scripture would you let me read those
[1:28:59] let me read verse 27 again if I could
[1:29:03] only let your conversation be as it
[1:29:06] becometh the gospel of Christ that
[1:29:09] whether I come and see you or else be
[1:29:12] absent I might hear of your affairs that
[1:29:15] you stand fast in one spirit with one
[1:29:18] mind striving together for the faith of
[1:29:21] the gospel now notice where he goes now
[1:29:24] and we're closed and in nothing
[1:29:28] terrified by your adversaries which is
[1:29:34] to them and evident token of perdition
[1:29:38] but to you of salvation and that of God
[1:29:43] I think brother bill maybe you have the
[1:29:45] story a little bit better than I do and
[1:29:48] I think brother the sound were told a
[1:29:49] story the one time
[1:29:51] where there was a group of ministers or
[1:29:54] group of people from I don't know Bible
[1:29:57] school or wherever it's from but the
[1:29:58] point of the story was these rebels
[1:30:01] stopped that bus
[1:30:02] they made every one of the ministers get
[1:30:04] out and here's what they made him do
[1:30:07] they said you either spit on your Bible
[1:30:10] or we're going to kill you
[1:30:13] every one of them spit on their Bible
[1:30:15] except one the god said kill every one
[1:30:19] of them except this guy because this is
[1:30:21] the true one you know why even in a
[1:30:25] pressure situation you can't get it out
[1:30:28] of his heart that's a real prisoner of
[1:30:32] jesus christ in nothing terrified by
[1:30:36] your adversaries let them breathe and
[1:30:40] bro and I'm gonna get you fired and I'm
[1:30:42] gonna do this and I'm gonna do that hold
[1:30:44] your peace
[1:30:45] don't let no guile be found in your
[1:30:47] mouth or your spirit hold your peace and
[1:30:51] go to God in prayer because that to them
[1:30:56] is an evident token of perdition but to
[1:30:59] you of salvation and that of God for
[1:31:01] unto you it is given in the behalf of
[1:31:04] Christ not only to believe on him but
[1:31:07] also to suffer for his sake having the
[1:31:10] same conflict which you saw in me and
[1:31:13] now here to be in me
[1:31:18] who's Paul riding too
[1:31:21] the Saints of Philippi the same Saints
[1:31:28] that the earth quaked the prison bars
[1:31:32] were hoping Paul and Silas were set free
[1:31:37] they could have went the rest of the
[1:31:40] prisoners could have went
[1:31:42] but instead they stayed because that was
[1:31:48] what God had him do
[1:31:50] there was a Philippian jailer that
[1:31:54] needed to be led to the Lord
[1:31:56] Paul was letting them know hey just
[1:31:59] because Godding brought an earthquake
[1:32:01] down here in Rome and set me free
[1:32:04] we're not defeated God did it that time
[1:32:07] in that situation we were there for a
[1:32:10] purpose and a need and just as he wrote
[1:32:13] to him earlier in this chapter the bonds
[1:32:16] in Christ are being made manifest in all
[1:32:19] the palace
[1:32:21] what's keeping your Paul I'm standing
[1:32:25] fast how by His grace Paul do you ever
[1:32:29] get a little down yeah there's sometimes
[1:32:31] I get down well what it encourages you
[1:32:34] or like David I begin to encourage
[1:32:37] myself in the Lord I begin to remember I
[1:32:40] was on the wrong path way and he came to
[1:32:43] me Paul what happens to it when
[1:32:48] sometimes you you feel like a little
[1:32:51] weak
[1:32:52] when I feel like a little weak I
[1:32:54] remember how many times that he's come
[1:32:58] to strengthen me Paul how do you know
[1:33:01] that even in this that you're not going
[1:33:03] to be killed
[1:33:04] well there's been other situations where
[1:33:06] my life's been up against the wall I
[1:33:07] know sometimes it hasn't been real
[1:33:10] glorious of my Exodus out of the city I
[1:33:14] know it may not be considered to be
[1:33:16] great and glorious and miraculous but I
[1:33:19] was grateful for the basket I was let
[1:33:21] down by what was all of that all of
[1:33:25] those things in that way it was to show
[1:33:28] humility let us not get in such a way to
[1:33:34] where things have to be this way have to
[1:33:36] be that way we all believe in the
[1:33:38] pattern and the working of the Holy
[1:33:40] Spirit but the way God answers prayer
[1:33:43] the way God comes and performs his word
[1:33:45] that's God will always come according to
[1:33:49] his characteristics may God help us as
[1:33:53] an assembly to stand fast in one spirit
[1:33:58] and I urge you tonight if you don't have
[1:34:02] the Holy Ghost that's what I'm preaching
[1:34:04] on this is the spirit that were to have
[1:34:07] because he won't do no good to take one
[1:34:10] another spirit you can have brother
[1:34:14] Samuel spirit and act like me I don't
[1:34:16] know why in the world you'd even want to
[1:34:21] come on now why would you why would you
[1:34:24] set up for something like that
[1:34:26] receive the Spirit of God then your
[1:34:30] United with Jesus Christ then it brings
[1:34:33] a real oneness with the body then though
[1:34:39] we all might have our own little
[1:34:40] opinions about something our own little
[1:34:43] ideas we've got a greater objective on
[1:34:45] the inside that we can look and say you
[1:34:47] know what that's my opinion but I ain't
[1:34:49] letting that get in the way of the body
[1:34:51] that's what the working of the Holy
[1:34:54] Ghost does in our heart when we've got
[1:34:57] the real Pentecostal objective it gives
[1:34:59] us strength to be able to lay down our
[1:35:01] opinions because we have to in order to
[1:35:04] be united your loving father we just
[1:35:09] thank you tonight Lord Jesus to see what
[1:35:14] you have you promised to us in this hour
[1:35:18] you promised by way of your word we see
[1:35:21] dear God to where that men Lord even as
[1:35:24] we Lord different times I'll see certain
[1:35:26] headlines or see things and different
[1:35:28] ones are calling for a revival and all
[1:35:30] these other things and yet Lord God it's
[1:35:34] the same thing what they did with John
[1:35:36] as Jesus would say they did to him
[1:35:39] whatsoever they listed to realize the
[1:35:41] Lord God that father they could feel the
[1:35:44] pull of a revival they can want to do
[1:35:48] something I think that Lord to me I
[1:35:50] think it's great like I look at David
[1:35:52] all it was a great thing that David
[1:35:54] wanted to do Saul had forsaken the Urim
[1:35:58] and the Thummim but David said hey let's
[1:36:01] bring it back David had the right motive
[1:36:05] your prophet told us he had the right
[1:36:07] objective but David's way of going about
[1:36:11] it
[1:36:13] was not according to the will of God was
[1:36:17] it the will of God for the ark to come
[1:36:19] back into Jerusalem it was but it must
[1:36:24] come according to the word or Jesus even
[1:36:32] though David had the right motive and
[1:36:33] objective but it was not according to
[1:36:36] the will of God it cost a man his life
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:39] and when the word came back around
[1:36:42] through Nathan a prophet he would take
[1:36:46] him right back to the word he let he let
[1:36:48] him know that revival it must come
[1:36:51] according through the word that
[1:36:53] inspiration must follow the channel of
[1:36:56] the word Lord Jesus even inspiration
[1:37:00] that moves throughout the congregation
[1:37:03] we believe Lord God that inspiration is
[1:37:06] to move according to the Word of God the
[1:37:11] Holy Spirit will never behave himself
[1:37:14] unseen the Holy Spirit will never draw
[1:37:18] attention to himself
[1:37:20] he'll never edify himself he'll never
[1:37:23] edify anything other than the kingdom of
[1:37:27] God
[1:37:30] help us your Jesus or now crave it for
[1:37:35] each and every one the Lord would be
[1:37:39] streaming under the sound of my voice
[1:37:43] your God for those that would look to me
[1:37:46] and call me their pastor that would call
[1:37:50] this their home church I ask right now
[1:37:55] Lord God let there not be one of them
[1:37:58] just be a member of this church
[1:38:02] just belong here that'll do him no good
[1:38:06] it's not just because they've got
[1:38:08] generations well my grandfather came
[1:38:10] here my daddy come here no that won't do
[1:38:15] you've got to have your own experience
[1:38:19] now maybe you can look in your life
[1:38:21] maybe the examples you've seen in front
[1:38:24] of you maybe they've come here to this
[1:38:26] church but maybe all they've been is up
[1:38:29] and down and up and down
[1:38:30] well I pray that God would so settle
[1:38:33] them and anchor them give them that real
[1:38:35] first that real feeling that they are
[1:38:37] looking for but what about you you don't
[1:38:43] have to live an up and down life you
[1:38:46] don't have to live a church life where
[1:38:49] the only thing is you're associated
[1:38:52] around a move of God why don't you let
[1:38:56] the Holy Ghost move in you why don't you
[1:38:59] let him move in you and move down in
[1:39:01] your life and let him birth you into
[1:39:05] this word into the body of Jesus Christ
[1:39:08] why don't you be willing to say Lord I
[1:39:11] surrender my ambitions
[1:39:14] I surrender my will I surrender all my
[1:39:17] objectives Lord God let it be one
[1:39:20] objective in my life
[1:39:22] let it be seated on the throne of my
[1:39:24] heart to control every action every
[1:39:27] thought let me be a vessel that is
[1:39:31] available then when my own thoughts get
[1:39:33] to rolling a certain way that my life
[1:39:37] can be moved upon by the mind of Christ
[1:39:41] and his mind can move down and override
[1:39:45] mine Lord Jesus granite - where Lord it
[1:39:50] becomes the message itself Oh God
[1:39:54] as your prophet told us in what house
[1:39:56] will you build me he said this message
[1:39:59] is not just to be the flame of the hour
[1:40:01] it's to be the flame in our hearts it
[1:40:05] must be in our hearts or we can't
[1:40:09] rightly represent it to the people
[1:40:13] or Jesus this is that conversation that
[1:40:18] life that Paul was talking about this is
[1:40:22] where Lord it's not begging people to
[1:40:25] serve you it's not Megan Lord but it's
[1:40:30] something arises from their heart they
[1:40:32] want to please you it's where an
[1:40:35] objective is so taking a hold in our
[1:40:38] lives that's greater than our own wills
[1:40:41] it's greater than our own opinions it's
[1:40:44] greater than our own ideas it's Jesus
[1:40:47] Christ
[1:40:48] oh god no wonder has Paul under
[1:40:56] inspiration would write to let this be
[1:40:59] the focus this would be the same
[1:41:01] admonition that Jude would write from
[1:41:05] when he would say I find it necessary to
[1:41:08] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:41:12] that she would earnestly contend for the
[1:41:16] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:41:17] Saints your God we know it's nothing new
[1:41:20] it's been going on your prophet has
[1:41:24] taken us through the word to show us
[1:41:26] Satan's spies as Paul would talk about
[1:41:29] previous wolves would infiltrate the
[1:41:34] ranks of our message and would want to
[1:41:37] leave the people away from a real
[1:41:40] genuine life of Jesus Christ or God
[1:41:46] what good does it do to half members
[1:41:52] what good does it do to have a group of
[1:41:55] people just to have people or Jesus this
[1:42:02] is not your desire your prayer is
[1:42:06] fulfilled for that oneness when it comes
[1:42:11] to that same oneness where you are in us
[1:42:16] and we are in you
[1:42:22] puts us in the word that's a real one
[1:42:26] that sets the grounds for fellowship
[1:42:29] this is then where we can fellowship or
[1:42:34] I pray tonight
[1:42:37] if there's any Lord where their focus
[1:42:39] has gone a little off maybe they've got
[1:42:42] entangled Lord you wrote to the
[1:42:46] Galatians they had got entangled there's
[1:42:48] certain things that they had got
[1:42:49] entangled they have been removed from
[1:42:51] the spiritual now they were dwelling
[1:42:53] back around in carnal things what if the
[1:42:57] focus has been lost
[1:43:01] how Lord God I rests Lord Jesus in your
[1:43:04] spirit to deal with each of our hearts
[1:43:06] if there's anything that's out of line
[1:43:08] if there's anything that's been set
[1:43:10] before you Nord God even if we've put
[1:43:14] family ahead of you then we've got the
[1:43:17] wrong order nothing should be ahead of
[1:43:21] you
[1:43:23] you should be the head of all things you
[1:43:27] should be first priority with decisions
[1:43:31] that we have to make it always got to be
[1:43:34] Christ is the center of every decision
[1:43:39] or Jesus help each and every one of us
[1:43:42] as your children help us Lord may you
[1:43:48] move for every heart right now Lord God
[1:43:50] behind every uplifted hand as they're
[1:43:52] gathered there in their homes around the
[1:43:54] computer tablet phone those that Lord
[1:43:57] will archive it later those of us
[1:43:59] gathered here Lord Jesus
[1:44:03] this is the one spirit we want to stand
[1:44:07] fast in one mind striving for the faith
[1:44:13] of the gospel
[1:44:14] it shows there'll be opposition and
[1:44:17] there is but Lord God may we strive with
[1:44:21] that unity of purpose if we've got one
[1:44:24] objective one goal and that's Jesus
[1:44:28] Christ and Lord God it'll help us
[1:44:33] through every little thing that the
[1:44:36] enemy would try to bring a throw away if
[1:44:38] we've got the right objective in the
[1:44:40] right purpose granted Lord we pray in
[1:44:46] Jesus name
[1:44:49] I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to
[1:44:58] the Lord

[1:48:48] [Applause]
[1:48:49] ore sanjou air
[1:48:57] oh my
[1:49:01] I hear the Prophet answer a question in
[1:49:05] questions and answers on the seals and
[1:49:08] think about I want you to catch this
[1:49:10] what has unfolded there that week the
[1:49:14] prophet has preached the six seals to
[1:49:20] know there's a great thing that's taking
[1:49:22] place you know different ones that were
[1:49:26] sitting there when it was being preached
[1:49:29] and you hear their testimony they said
[1:49:32] we know something great was going on but
[1:49:35] we just didn't know what was taking
[1:49:37] place and now I want you to catch this
[1:49:42] here it is questions and answers on the
[1:49:45] scenes the questions are answered by the
[1:49:49] random room with where we're at should
[1:49:52] evangelists go out how does brother
[1:49:55] Branham respond to him he takes a whole
[1:49:58] thought within that and he ties it
[1:50:01] together like a farmer planting potatoes
[1:50:06] and he said you keep planting potatoes
[1:50:13] you live you plan for tomorrow but you
[1:50:17] live as if he's going to come the next
[1:50:19] moment this is what the scripture is
[1:50:22] talking about who thought we would be
[1:50:28] here in 2020 come on now who thought
[1:50:35] we'd be here in 2020
[1:50:36] that's why it just goes to show don't
[1:50:39] let our thoughts be what's dictating
[1:50:41] let's walk in step with the word but
[1:50:45] assuming you honestly believe that
[1:50:47] there's going to be college students
[1:50:48] raptured I do
[1:50:50] I believe there's gonna be middle
[1:50:51] schoolers rapture come on somebody
[1:50:55] I believe there's gonna be people
[1:50:57] sitting in nursing homes gonna be
[1:50:59] raptured come on now they're all tied
[1:51:03] together yes sir because why these are
[1:51:10] things in the natural but we've got one
[1:51:11] objective you see what we're moving into
[1:51:14] this part of this right here this is why
[1:51:17] our objective our vision must be single
[1:51:20] must be Jesus Christ
[1:51:24] then he becomes the filter of all things
[1:51:29] every decision comes through Christ
[1:51:32] every decision is late will Jesus Christ
[1:51:35] be glorified in my life Paul could say
[1:51:38] I'm determined he's going to be
[1:51:40] magnified in my body and every decision
[1:51:42] to a believer who is where our
[1:51:44] heartbeats is Christ's going to be
[1:51:46] magnified if I make this move you can do
[1:51:49] it you can make it you're free to do it
[1:51:52] but the decision is will Christ be
[1:51:56] magnified that's the heartbeat of the
[1:52:00] believer Christ who is our life when he
[1:52:02] shall appear
[1:52:06] hallelu this is what we're looking for
[1:52:10] this is what we're living for amen god
[1:52:14] bless you tonight
[1:52:15] we just want to say we love you in the
[1:52:17] Lord amen just continue to pay close
[1:52:21] attention as a church to the emails that
