beautiful day we so appreciate those days that are filled with sun just something about it seems like it gives you just a little shot in the arm and uh I don't know if you know this or not it may not be uh it's not a spiritual statistics but it's just uh my wife was sharing this with the other day that this past January was the gloomiest gloomiest January that's been on record but aren't you glad there's sunshine in your soul I'm so grateful to the Lord for that I'm glad that we're not depending on the the stars for our light we're not even depending on Candlelight for our light but God he is the light of my life amen and he gives us strength to push through all of that amen so so good to be in the house of the Lord and we just want to look into the word for what the Lord would have for us this morning as you would turn there in the scriptures to Acts chapter N9 I I want to just make a couple announcements that just brother uh brother Josh Martin will be ministering for us here this coming Thursday and it be the first time brother Josh has been here to minister uh for us he was here with us in service on a Thursday night um about two months ago and so we just uh want to be in prayer for that on Thursday evening and then as well uh the fellowship dinner that's coming up on Sunday February 18th I think there probably his details posted on the bulletin boards you've got it in the email as well but uh if it's not on the bulletin board we'll get it put on there um but let's just um let's approach the the word here this morning and just has some things on my heart that uh the Lord just pressing on my heart so we just want to mind the Lord we want to just pray together that God will just have control in this service once again we we need to hear from him and U we want to be able to not only to um to hear from him but God may he give us the grace to receive amen what it is that he's speaking to us and how to apply it to our lives amen could we just go to him in prayer as we have the scriptures open and let's just ask the author to come and that he had just open his word to our hearts Heavenly Father oh how thankful we are Lord for the privilege that you have given us to come and assemble together Lord with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith Lord it is C certainly a privilege and an honor and we want to say thank you for the beautiful day you've given us Lord the sunshine on the outside and Lord we just pray Lord that may the great rays of the N Lord oh the son of the Living God may it just shine Lord Upon Our Lives and into every heart Lord may you have your way in this service Lord and for every need that and every request that Lord that your children would have upon their hearts Lord may you just come Lord oh God like you promised the Do Lord God to the firstborn Lord May Lord your presence just come like the Do Lord and just settle it down lord in our hearts oh God that it's over it's finished Lord and father we can begin to thank you for the requests Lord may you just have your way Lord in every one of our hearts this morning Lord may you move Among Us in a special way Lord and help us Lord that we can grasp the things that you Lord would would speak to us Lord we know that it'll take more than just Lord our natural ability we're asking God for the holy spirit that you would come Lord speak through US Lord and reveal Lord your word Lord to our lives Lord give us the grace Lord that we might be able to see what the father is doing and do likewise Lord we love you and we thank you Father for your mercy once again this morning we just pray Lord may you come and open the word to our hearts Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'd like to begin in Acts chapter 9 and uh verse three and this is the account of Saul when he is preparing to go and arrest more of the Believers and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks now if you'll notice when he's asked he's seen this same Pillar of Fire that Moses saw and he's asked who are you Lord because every time when he would appear God would make known his name or that of a Redemptive name and so asked him who are you so now the same Lord Jesus who walked in the Corporal body which is God came now has descended back down and tabernacled in his body of Believers and Paul was the one who was persecuting the work of God but to think just in a moment's notice just in a moment in the presence of God everything changes who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord What wilt thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do but the Lord now let's go to verse 15 and here is the Lord speaking to ananas you can find you know in the scripture if your Bible reader ananas was a little worried about even though when the Lord spoke to him and told him what to do he's a little worried Lord you know about this guy this guy I mean I if I go and approach him he's already been hailing people away and they've been killing people for this but notice how the Lord just Comforts ananas the Lord said unto him go thy way for he speaking of Paul is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul I like that don't you brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forwith and arose and was baptized amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to read a quote to you from the message of the hour brother REM says God is just he will not send judgment before he offers mercy and anybody's a Bible reader you you know that that before God will send judgment such as what the Judgment that was impending in the days of Noah God first sent his mercy and God Not only would reveal this Mercy his way his plan his approach to Noah Noah would act upon that Noah would preach for 120 years it was God's mercy that was ringing out to that generation and yet only eight were saved out of that whole generation but Noah preached as though that everybody could be saved you see I'm thankful that God puts it in our hearts to have the confidence that what God did for me what God has done for you it's a reality that you know that God it is a paradox of how that God has overrode our first nature and been able to turn things around to a submissiveness to him and so our confidence is not in our ability to speak the word our confidence is not in our ability to debate the word word but our confidence is The God Who lives inside our heart and for what he's done for me what he's done in you that then becomes the experience or the witness from which we speak from and anything less than that it it won't get the job done it must be God himself and so we find that every time before judgment there is Mercy that is given even when Moses went down with a message the message itself was a message of Mercy is that right even when God himself steps down in and puts upon a body of Flesh and it comes before Abraham's tent door it's a message of Mercy but yet when lot himself remember what actually happens is there comes a judgment upon Sodom so every time when we find that and yet you know there was Mercy that was given there but uh we think about the mercy of God and so every time that when God would send his Mercy we certainly want to receive God's mercy I want to receive all the mercy that God has for me when we look at this here let me finish this quote and brother BR says and mercy is foretold and how it will come and but the people usually is so all mixed up and in their minds and so many different man-made schemes till they don't recognize it and that's the way it always happens remember the Pharisees when they stood there religious men of that day knew the scripture very well they knew the writings of the prophets they knew the law but when the Lord Jesus God's mercy made manifest before them which had been prophesied all the way through the scriptures and had already been declared but yet when God's mercy was being projected to them they rejected it and they themselves turned around and called it be Elba they had there was so many other schemes and so many other ways that they had figured out and it didn't come according to how that they had it figured out so they didn't receive it even though they could not deny that this word it was it was God that was with this man they couldn't deny it Nicodemus let the cat out of the bag Nicodemus said we know that thou art a teacher come from God so they knew it but you know it was something about it they were not able or did not have the ability to actually be able to submit their hearts and lives to the mercy of God that was being made manifest I I don't know about you but I want my heart to be in that place Lord let my heart be tenderized Let It Be softened you know even with the promise that God sends to you and I when the mercy of God is moving in this generation moving in every and each time that it's coming forth you realize it's the spirit of God that goes forth that begins to call the elect begins to break down and begins to move upon Hearts to bring you and I into that place of condition to be able to receive the mercy of God so it's it's not you or I it's not him that willth not him that runneth but it's God that showeth mercy so when we look at this and considering the mercy of God I I want to speak here just a few moments on the thought of in in in that of in response to his Mercy in response to his Mercy now let me read I just referred to this scripture but let me read out of Romans 9 Paul would be the one that would be the writer here he would know this by Revelation and experience what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy so the display of mercy of God's mercy rests solely on God himself it's God showing his mercy so how does God show Mercy how does God show compassion by showing his Mercy well what's his Mercy his Mercy is himself his Mercy is making known the word that he has promised in that generation and making it alive and making it real that is God showing Mercy then what would it be for those who actually are captured and receive that Mercy then they are recipients of the mercy that God has shown now let's see this in the scripture verse 17 for the scripture said unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth now think about this thou wil say then why then why does he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus now think about it here here is God displaying his Mercy when God hardened Pharaoh's heart it wasn't that God came down in an obstinate way an arrogant way no remember showing Mercy is the displaying of his promise He makes himself known that he is the god of his word that he is still the I am and it's incredible thing how that when God will make himself known by his promise there will be some that will actually become hardened at the manifestation and then there are others who actually become tenderized and actually receive the mercy of God so you say what is it that makes the determining Factor well it's the choice whether to receive it or to reject it I thank God for his Mercy don't you I thank God for his Mercy because it isn't that God was just coming right at at Pharaoh remember the same promise that was made manifest to Pharaoh was manifest to the children of Israel but there was something different on the inside that was able to be captured by and be moved by the mercy of God in that moment now watch verse 21 hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory so now all mankind is out of the same lump of clay our our flesh is no different than anybody else's flesh as a matter of fact the even the elements that make our flesh up it's no different than pig skin cow skin cow hide and on and on it's out of the same elements of this Earth but there must be something that is different that that would resolve within a life that would absolutely separate a life from being a vessel Of Dishonor to a vessel of Honor now I don't mind telling you in times past Paul said we lived as vessels of Dishonor we were moved about by The Prince and power of the air we were carried here and there what was it we were actually in our life bearing false witness of the truth that was actually in us but when the light comes across our pathway what does it do it breaks the LIE of the first birth it breaks the delusion and the lie and it allows then the truth to come into expression that we in ourselves might be bear witness of the truth that was always in us but now the mercy of God has been displayed to Quicken that life and here we are vessels of Mercy now a vessel you know you have vessels utensils instruments in your house you have vessels that you place things in you you use them they are meant for for a certain purpose pots and so forth and things and that's the same thing it is within our life we we are intended to be as vessels of God's mercy so when someone can look at your life look at my life it ought to be such like a billboard that this is God's mercy in this hour on display if there's anything of a greater witness that we can give you listen I I I believe that we we should give ourselves to the word I believe we ought to take the word in but let me tell you what's more powerful ful then you know in a whole list of quotes you know in a whole list of scriptures is having the life of God on the inside of you and being able to live an overcoming life again and again and again because somebody on the workplace or in your family may never ever ask you for a scripture they may never ask you for anything but they will see your life on display and see God's mercy and then because of that then you yourself are like ananas you are a vessel of Mercy going and displaying God's mercy to another vessel that that vessel itself might be captured by the same life that's inside of you in response to God's mercy now notice Mercy itself I I love this the very word itself of Mercy Mercy means the kindness or the Good Will towards the miserable and The Afflicted how many are witnesses of that I like this next part joined with a desire to help them God's mercy was projected and he shows his Mercy to The Afflicted to the destitute to the downcast and he joins himself in order to help us now how does God join himself to you and I well God joins himself first of all by uniting himself with his word and manifesting it and God will take that word and speak it through chosen vessels he'll move it down and then the word that we hear that Mercy being shown it will spark something inside of our life and then it becomes the mercy of God joining with our lives to help us live an overcoming life aren't you glad for that no wonder Paul could write in 2 Corinthians 47 knowing his own Humanity we have this treasure this Mercy in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us now I want you to think about this in this in this manner I'm going to just take a little journey here this morning uh I've really just been pouring through the book of Acts and how the Lord's been taking me in that direction but I want to just pour it in this way and I want you to keep that word response in your mind and in your heart in response to his Mercy oh I pray to God that we would have a resp responds continually to the mercy of God Lord help us to be sensitive help us to have a heart that's ready to respond I I don't want to be weighed down with the cares of this life everybody knows that's a battle is that right you know it's a battle in your mind there's things that'll try to take your mind right here in service there's things that'll try to weigh you down things can get on your mind but this is where to say Lord I Need Your Grace and I need your help Lord help me not to miss what it is that you want to say to me amen now notice this in Acts 1 and verse 2 until the day now here's after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles which he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God now think about it the deciples remember they were walking around they were bewildered they could not figure out what had taken place we thought he should have been a redeemer well he was but it wasn't it didn't happen according to how they thought it should happen but you know one thing I love about this is that although there can be for the elect of God some part that seemingly could go over our head God in his grace when it's time for that word to be made known to you and I he'll come right back around and take a hold of our life and begin to reveal himself self that he indeed is the promis keeping God that's what he did to him on the road to emus now think about it the next promise that there to receive the whole coming of the Redeemer why did he come well he come to redeem us that's true but remember Redemption was through the shedding of the blood to pay the price settle the sin debt but then that that life that was in that blood cell God's own life Zoe could then be released back upon the worshipper to where it could actually bring for for the new birth because before this coming of the Holy Ghost there's no New Birth there's no Born Again experience that can only come by the Holy Spirit himself giving birth to his seed or quickening that life on the inside now think about it here is the Lord here is the Lord Jesus here is God in fulfillment of his word the next Junction is that where they themselves would go and wait for Joel 2:28 the promise of the father the Holy Spirit to be poured out but in order to get to that place he being a faithful father to his children would gather them around and begin to point them to the promise and let them know that what God has said is true now this is the promise for your life and that's the coming of the Holy Ghost In other words God doesn't leave anything to guesswork in our life if we're the one listen to me now if we're the ones that's guessing then that's where we need to say Lord get me out of this guessing pattern and Lord help me to get tuned into to you help me not to be listening to so many other voices and help me to get dialed into the voice of almighty God because God prepares us for every Junction for each moment and this is why we need the leadership of the spirit of God that's why the Rapture itself is not going to be a Quantum Leap but the Rapture will be step in the life of a Believer where God has been working in a life day by day and we are making steps in him his word is moving in our lives and it will be another step in the life of a Believer so God just doesn't do Quantum leaps it's every step and all words are fulfilled in that order now notice think about this I want you to think you think God didn't want to come in and fill them right then sure he did but he's the only way that's going to happen is it must be according to the word and their faith must be established on the word you see if you're if you can get to a place to where your faith is established on the word to know that God gave the word and sent the promise for you there's not enough devils in hell can stand between you and that promise there's a hunger in your heart for a veil to be broken there's a veil sure as the world to be broken and the spirit of God will bring us into that place now watch this verse four and being assembled with them together commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence so notice he's he's admonishing them as his children that wait upon the promise don't don't go out don't do anything until you have the Assurance of the promise and this is what he says a few verses on down in verse eight but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth now I want you to watch here I read part of this to you last week out of the message what house will you build me and brother Bram says not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people people the spirit has to pack the message itself so it it won't do any good if it's just up here it won't do any good if it's just on a bookshelf it won't do any good if it's just on your tablet or on your phone it's got to be down inside of our heart and that is a sovereign work between you and God alone but let me just say this to you God will deal with your heart like he dealt with them on Luke 24 and God will try to move you and I around to point us to the promise that's for us now what matters is whether or not we will take it seriously and give ourselves to it we want to have the right response to God's mercy because we're never promised multiple opportunities is that right we're not promised that we're only promised one opportunity as a matter of fact in the message marriage of the Lamb brother Bram talks in the end of that message and he speaks of how just the previous nights before that he'd come out of a meeting and here it was was he said I no sooner got out of the door in 15 minutes he said here's this car accident and he said with this car accident here was a mother that was laying there taking her last breath and he said her daughter was standing right beside her and the mother spoke to her daughter and said daughter we did wrong tonight we did not respond to the call of the Holy Spirit she said brother brother bam that was her last words I tell you we do not know what the next moment holds that that's not to bring fear but it's to understand this life is not about this life this life is a moment of preparation getting you ready for the next life you have to have an assurance right now that you're ready to go amen and if you don't then there's a time right here this morning would be a time and a place to settle it so when we look at this and we we talk about as brother Bram is bring BR in this in and what house will you build me remember as we've been looking at this with the Queen of Sheba and how the brother says that when Israel saw that gift manifested they rallied around that gift now when you think of the word rally don't think of it like a pep rally because a pep rally can be people catching one another's spirit and they're all just kind of worked up into an emotion that's not what a rally is brother Bam's telling us what this rally is he said if we will rally around the gift of the Holy Ghost in This last days it'll set such a love of God in your heart and for the heart of others he said you won't be critical and tearing one another down you will actually be be joined together in a real Divine love so let me tell you how we rally we do not Rally by getting around the message the message the message we rally in the right way by having the message inside of us by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost in our life y that's how we really rally around this word amen now look at this in the message desperation brother BR says the token now he's just preached that morning the token message he says the token Jesus Christ the holy spirit is among us we should reverence that we can't humble ourselves enough and watch what he says taking off our shoes getting on your knees wouldn't expel it it wouldn't satisfy it wouldn't suffice it so anything as far as we can we could get down upon our knees we could take off our shoes like Moses did but that won't suffice it you see not only will it not suffice God but that suffice won't reain and reach back into your heart in a settl either the only way that it can actually be in the correct way is is that our heart must come into a place of surrender and ever remain there notice but a life that brings forth the fruit of the spirit now he says now what is the fruit of the spirit love joy peace referring to gal Galatians 5 now watch remember this morning watch this progression preparation he sent the messenger with a message the next thing he done after he sent the messenger with the message he sent the pillar of Fire for a Vindication next thing after that was a consolation you knew that it was right you was at peace we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ so he sends the messenger with a message that's what he did down in Egypt right this is God works God's patterns don't change he sent a messenger with the message then he accompanies that vindicating that that message is not that man's ideas that this is my thoughts this is my word is that right so the pillar of Fire coming to vindicate the message it raises it to an absolute why because it's God's thoughts this is why sometimes where people struggle and well I'm claiming the Bible as my absolute you cannot just claim the Bible as your absolute and deny God revealing his word in this hour because listen you and I for Generations men walked according to their own thoughts about God's word but God in this hour has raised his word and he has displayed his thoughts concerning his word I'll tell you what that does that brings Liberty and deliverance to the children of God it gives you a place that you can reach out of and say that's a certain place that I can get to and stand on aren't you glad oh I more to be said on that but anyhow notice how that the message accompanied with a pillar of fire and then the next thing that follows that was to take the lamb slay it and apply the blood and eat that lamb in order to be at peace so what they had accepted was the messenger's message that had been confirmed by the pillar of fire and now they had a confirmation in their heart they were at peace right I tell you there's nothing greater than the Peace of almighty God is that right it's a peace that passes all understanding amen now watch this in Acts chapter 2 let's talk about this flame a little bit when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them same Pillar of Fire and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so who is the spirit of God falling upon who is it falling and filling it is filling Sons and Daughters of God vessels that have been for prepared to receive God's mercy amen God's mercy had been made manifest according to the promise had walked with them they fished with it they all that was in the ship and the boat but now that same Mercy that had merged within flesh and been manifest to them now that same Mercy was now behind their flesh amen oh glory be to God and it was helping them along the way oh my watch this we talk about this flame of fire how many knows when Moses went and he saw that Bush the mo Moses was absolutely attracted and taken away because he saw this bush on fire but yet it wasn't burning right brother BR says this in the angel of the Lord in 1951 he says now he said when he spoke God spoke to him attracted his attention by a pillar of fire that fell into a bush and began to burn and pop and burn it looks like if it was a fire it would have scorched the bush or burn it but it was a supernatural fire who could burn the bush and yet it would still will be there oh he said I'm thankful tonight for a supernatural the Holy Spirit God's flame of fire who could come down in the human heart burn out all the sin and unbelief don't harm the person but it purges him and makes him grow greater be stronger more faith and he comes tonight in that way oh he said he can come down into a human body drive out the power of cancer tumor cataract tuberculosis with fire Heavenly Holy Spirit fire falling from God out of Heaven why that's no M mystery if he can burn inbred sin out how much more can he burn cancer out by the same Holy Spirit you see this is why the coming of the holy spirit is not trying to perfect this when it gets burned out here this will reflect what's in hereall now watch this how our God is a consuming fire on and on through the scriptures we could take that with Elijah on Mount Carmel Moses as we said there Gideon we could speak of that Samson's daddy manoah after the angel of the Lord had revealed the order of the child then he was was lifted up fire he consumed the offering but you know when you think of it that your life at one time look how Paul writes this at one time you and I were Darkness not sometimes not not you were in darkness we were Darkness but he said says now are ye light in the Lord not you're in it it's in you you are light in other words light is the manifestation of God's spoken word in other words your life is the manifestation of Christ in this hour amen my my my now watch this let me just take a few of this because peace itself it actually peace will exhibit itself in confid confidence and in boldness not arrogance but confidence and boldness that's what peace does now watch this brother Brandman 1964 questions and answers he says when you're filled with the spirit here's one of the best signs I know you're so in love with Christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth now if I just stopped on the first part be so in love with Christ many people can love Christ the Christ of their imagination that that God who is you know he just when he walks honey just seeps out of him that he loves me so much he he don't care about my life and he knows I can't live Victorious that's not the right kind of love that's you trying to love God With Your Love but the Bible said we love him agap him because he first Agape loved us God we cannot love God with our FAL love it'll fall off the wagon we must have the love of God which is the fire of God which is the Holy Ghost God's flame burning in our hearts oh my you're so in love with Christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth so if there's a spirit in you that resists the word that's not the Holy Spirit that's the evidence that you have the Holy Spirit and your life's full of joy oh my everything's different than what it used to be that's the Holy Spirit Well brother Samuel you have to tell you what I'm so down in the Molly grubs well the problem is not with God right amen amen if you've got the Holy Spirit maybe you're the one who's gotten awake and got cold but there's a way to have the joy restored back to you come back and do the first Works come back come back where you left him come back where you drifted from him notice in the message the Good Shepherd of the sheep I love this quote brother brandom do you mean to tell me you believe if a man is really a child of God that he really really can know that he's a child of God I said absolutely when your spirit quote in Romans 8 when your spirit Bears record with his word and his Spirit you are Sons and Daughters of God when your experience comes into God's Bible and you met every requirement and God has proved to you and all the world has passed away you become a new creature then you've passed from Death unto life God has did it amen what are we talking about responses to his Mercy amen responses to his Mercy in the message Abraham it's everything absolutely positive a man that becomes a child of God has a positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has a positive hold on him with the Assurance by almighty God by an oath to himself that he will raise him up in the last days and take him to Glory there's not no if or and or nothing it's something that's positive let me finish the quote now you can be mentally worked up or emotionally worked up and just imagine your faith but when your spirit Bears record with his Spirit remember his spirit is his word they do not work in con contrary they work in harmony it's the spirit of Truth when he is come amen he will lead and guide you into all truth are you with me notice when your life Compares with God's Bible you've got a pretty good conception it's all at peace but if it don't compare with that then you better come back again if you don't love him with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind if sin doesn't just make you tremble at the thoughts of it You' better come back and be sure what is that your spirit bearing witness with his spirit amen with his word then you have a god given authority to act as a son and daughter of God now watch this and Peter and them come out of the upper room here they are they're filled right the fire of God has issued down into their lives it's quickened that life now they were not just around the message they were not just around the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ it was not just something that they could talk about the stories and testimonies but they had had the same they had a part of that same Lord Jesus by the spirit of God dwelling in their lives to where that they themselves could testify he is the Christ you realize when the scripture says that when they came out of the upper room when they came out they gathered at that time all the Jews from different places around because it was a feast time Feast of Passover one of the feasts where all the males were to come together and present themselves and here they were and when they came out of the upper room and begin to speak the Fulfillment of the word that the atonement the true Passover Lamb had come been offered up and now the life in that lamb had now come in response to the Fulfillment of Pentecost and when they spoke the Bible said how hear we every man in our own tongue so the miracle itself was not the speaking they were not speaking in unknown tongues they were speaking speaking in their own language but the spirit of God was breaking it down in the hearing of the others how hear we every man in our own language is that right now notice this right here this is you see there's so many wonderful Parts within that God was even showing his Mercy that his Mercy will be taken to Every Nation every tongue will have their chance at the fresh word of God that the holy spirit is no respector persons he will visit and declare himself to every tongue my my my my my notice this in Acts chap 2 verse 36 therefore P Peter stepping out let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ when they heard this now watch this response when they heard this they were were pricked Amen in their heart now remember chapters later Stephen is preaching the same thing right and the Bible says those Pharisees that heard him were pricked in their heart it was different though the response was different to God's mercy and Peter said you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do you what were they resisting they were resisting the very God they claimed to believe in the very God they were resisting his Mercy listen to me God was not resisting them God was showing his mercy God was showing his Mercy if you probably had to count I wonder how many Believers were standing there that day when Peter G or when Steven gave that exhortation it might have just been a handful cuz it was only just a small amount but the majority was that of the religious of that day God was not resisting them they resisted God do you realize God don't send any man to hell or woman they send themselves there by the choices they make and overrun God will put barrier after barrier roadblock after roadblock he'll deal with the heart again and again and again I tell you when you keep turning it down the voice starts getting less and less it'd be just like them turning down this microphone it keeps getting lower and lower and lower and lower and lower till eventually you're able to completely override it oh may God be merciful May there not be one of us here notice in verse 37 when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do see that's always the question when the when the mercy of God is being shown then it always brings out like Paul what would you have me do Lord show me lead me see immediately you know that's equality even when Joshua was standing before Jericho when the Great captain of the Lord's host that Pillar of Fire had become a man and he stood right there to lead him into battle as soon as Joshua recognized who it was he fell on his face and said what would you have your servant do when when Abraham met MDC in the Valley of the plain of the Kings what did he do he gave himself and he worshiped is that right showing what every son and daughter of God would do in the end time when MDC is made manifest in our midst do you see it's something about it that as the word is being fulfilled it passes over vessels and that Mercy makes known and it draws out a vessel where the mercy joins itself to it joins itself to do what lead us in justification lead us in sanctification lead us into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and lead us to the change of the body my Lord have mercy I'm telling you God who is rich in Mercy here's this formula what shall we do repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost no maybe's there for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call now watch's this in response watch watch how brother R will make some statements here I want you to keep keep this in mind there's a lot maybe a lot within the thought of it but I want you to keep this in mind on response brother BR says our heavenly father it's such a lovely group of people they're so responsive we're so happy Lord ministers to be able to see people who respond to the gospel it means there's a sign a sound of a rushing wind in the air so when hearts are responding now it may not be altogether physically something that will be seen but what's important is that our hearts respond to him and that you obey what he is asking you to do is that all right notice testimony uh uh raising a dead boy boy I'm glad that brother Bri was able to kind of maneuver that stuff back there and get these up brother man was talking to a lady with female trouble he says you believe me with all your heart I'm afraid I'm not catching you you're missing it I see it come to you and you don't respond to the call and as and and as soon as you do it moves from you cause that faith has to catch it then you get in your mind notice you get in your mind your wondering if it's to somebody else and it's you God are you talking to me Lord are you speaking to me and because she's not reaching out and recognizing hey if there ain't nobody else if this thing was filled with thousands of people when I feel that tug in my heart that's God speaking personally to me but because she wasn't responding to it reaching out and grabbing in faith instead her mind was wondering I wonder if it's me I wonder if it's me and it's you notice this brother B is talking in demonology a religious realm he's talking about a man that he's just been brought to his attention from a previous service and brother Bram is talking about how that a person must respond he says then if that person don't respond talking about when the angel of the Lord is moving Visions are being called out things that he's Discerning the hearts if that person don't respond he said it'd be like reading the Bible here and saying nothing to it and walk away from it so that makes it pretty bad so be on alert be listening be watching when he speaks answer just be ready to answer at any time oh my oh Lord you don't know I I've got so cold on you why let the coldness keep you back it's a time that you can move up by the fire it's a time you can let the fire come back in it's a time to rekindle the love of God in your life are you hearing me how does that happen by being ready Lord I'm going to lay that aside I'm going to take in Lord into my life Lord to respond to this word that's being spoken right here you are dealing with My Heart Lord and I'm going to respond to your mercy oh brother BR goes on to talk about this this gentleman he said so he said they were telling me he said this I was calling out this man and something about the brother he had something wrong with him and so forth and the man did not respond to the call so that can't be helped that's between God and the man the vision left me I couldn't find it no more because he didn't answer so be watching be on alert brother Bram kept watching for that light to come back over that man but that light wasn't coming back over that man that man had missed his opportunity right because he did not respond to the mercy of God now listen we understand when we come in here brother Ram tells us very clearly questions and answers on the Holy Ghost when the sons of God get together he said Satan gets right there among them too spirits will get right here among you realize spirits will try to take your mind put it on things of of the of the world and of the earth and of your job and this and that it'll even take listen sometimes it's not even on sinful things if Satan can just get your mind distracted enough you can miss what God is pulsating to you and God in his Mercy how many times that brother B would say it over and over oh lord they're going to miss it lord they're going to miss it Lord help me Lord and then God in his grace would call out that person's name why so it didn't miss him amen listen I believe in God's grace I I know it works that way amen but I believe that as children of God if we can take what God is saying to us Lord I don't want to have to come and sit here after service and you've got to call my name I want to be ready I want to be alert I want to respond to the mercy of God is that right notice show us the father and it'll satisfy what about it sir with that prostrate trouble sitting up there nervous you're sitting up there looking at me see the man lost his healing right there it moved away and turned dark around him again he didn't catch it you got to answer when the Holy Ghost is speaking to you answer sure he wants you to answer him it's your faith answering to the respond of the word it was turning light around the man I was trying to get his attention he's somewhere sitting in there but it left him and went away I called him and I pointed right to him but it turned dark around the man and the vision left me it went back to him went back from him he says you can't Bluff God you can't Bluff Satan you've got to know that God has the preeminence he's God think about this a response to the word right now watch how brother Ram would put this in Hebrews chapter 3 he says now don't just go away from church today and say well I kind of enjoy going down there I I like the sing and the people all friendly around that little old church don't do that brother let your heart become a flame and say here I got to do something about this I got to get out and see if I can get somebody saved this is what the flame of God will also move within your heart or brother time you know I I can't lay everything out listen God God will only require a of you what he has required of you God's not going to require of you to be a preacher to be a minister if that's not what he's called you to be and and to tell you the truth listen even with where you're at you might be the newest of Christian and you might say how could I witness God will take the testimony of how your candle got lit and he will cause that testimony to speak to somebody else's life God's not going to put you in a place of failure but God will use your testimony that you have have right now if you just will yield it to him is that all right now I'm looking at this this in response to his Mercy I want you to look at this here many times you know many different places I've been studying through the book of Acts and the falling of the Holy Ghost and looking at through all of these through all of these different accounts and you know when we look here I want to take one one account right here this morning in that of a sister by the name of Lydia A lot of times it's not read too much about matter of fact brother bandam only mentions it uh the one time there in the church age book refers to it even of what many scholars will say that they don't know whether she's Jew or Gentile she was one of Paul's first European converts but I want you to notice something here in Acts chapter 16:2 this is what I want you to notice the burden that when God had so touched their lives the fire of God's love burnt within their hearts to where they had one objective and that one objective was was to serve God with all their heart hearts and to take that same fire and be able to see that fire be imp parted into the lives of others that's Godlike aren't you glad that God came down from glory for you and I aren't you glad for that well see when Redemption strikes our heart we act like God it isn't me or you as far as I can walk up to a person and say hey I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost will pass through the body is that right there were angels that came to Cornelius but the Angels did not give him the Holy Ghost is that right and look the Phillip the the unic was reading was reading there in the scriptures is that right but God took lifted up Phillip out of the Revival Samaria and had him go join himself to that Chariot where that unic was at and the unic was reading Isaiah 53 and Philip said do you know what you're reading he said he said I need how can I except some man Teach me so the spirit of God inside of Phillip begin to expound and bring from prophecy into the Fulfillment of the word of God and that unic raised up and said hey I need to be baptized right here's water what's stopping us he responded to God's mercy this is this is what it's all about now notice this in Lydia's house the Bible tells us that from F to Philippi in verse 12 of act 16 which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia and a colony we were in the city abiding certain days and on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a Riverside where RI where prayer was want to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted fither now here here uh here they are those of the Jews whether Lydia was a Jew or not she was a prolite here they are meeting next to the river just a small handful of people when you look and begin to look in through and study that within history if there would have been at least 10 Jewish men they would had a synagogue but you see the women are not counted amongst that number but to think here they were just a small group of people this is what struck my heart that from this small group of people God would raise up a church till Paul would mention it in the book of Philippians to the churches that are in Philippi oh my it only takes a little fire to get more fire going notice this and a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of thara which worshiped God H us whose heart the Lord opened that's key that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul so she heard him and God opened her heart now notice this word she attended unto the things that were spoken of Paul this word attended means to bring near to bring a ship to land and to touch at it to put in it means to turn the mind to to attend to be attentive to a person or a thing of caring for providing for to apply oneself to or attach oneself to hold or cleave to a person or a thing to be given or addicted to to devote thought and effort she attended to what was said now I wonder what our lives would be like if we attended more to what God's saying come on friends we know the cares as I said we know the cares we know the pressures we know things of life but I wonder if if we could say Lord let me attend in the right way let me attend to the to the things of God let me have the right response to it in other words Lord I I I I don't want to just show up and you know I fulfilled a duty and and it's just a time then we we leave out of here but I want to attend to the things of God oh it's getting quiet now we're just getting warmed up verse 15 when she was baptized look at the result from this she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if you've judge me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us she was so taken so attended to the word of God she said if you've counted me to be faithful come into my houseall this is what the woman of zerath did this is what the woman of shunum did is that right this is what Abraham did invite him come in if you judge me to be faithful what is the greatest honor I could do for you come to my home come to my home Lord Jesus be the center of my home be the center of my family what's the Great greatest honor that I could do for you be the sole influence of Our Lives Lord be the flame Lord that presents it notice and who is this mezic brother B says he's in prayer as we speak Thy word and the promises given to us may we nurture them in our hearts cherish them with reverence and Obey them with real Godly discipline so simply put when God speaks to our hearts deals with our lives we take that word begin to nurture it begin to nurture what is it it's it's taking it very close very dear to us almost like almost like it's like a baby like an infant and you're nurturing it you're holding it close to your bosom and then as cherishing it by reverencing that word not my will thy will be done Lord and obeying it with Godly discipline where the word word is shaping even the conscience in our spirit realm that Lord my my my feet are going to walk this way I might still have temptations out here but my feet are going to walk according to your word I will walk according to your word then the spirit of God will move around and confirm it in my life and bring it to pass is that right my my my my my this is what Rahab did she received the word into her house now let me let me let me get can I have one more example acts 16:25 Philippian Jailer you're familiar with him Paul goes right from this event at Lydia's house and they get thrown in jail because there was a woman that had a familiar Spirit she was a slave and she was speaking for her owners who were these gods and so forth they were making and when Paul got permission from God to cast that thing out when they got permission from God then it stirred up it stirred up the enemy let me just tell you something right now when you read through the book of Acts every time that God was moving in hearts and lives you watch the devil get mad let me just say let me just quote this to you the devil the prophet tells us in Acts of the Holy Spirit he said when the Holy Ghost came down and filled them on the day of Pentecost the devil never even set up on his bed right never set up on his bed but he said when they walked out of that upper room and there was that man at the gate called beautiful right and they said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee rise up and walk he said that got the devil mad right there why because that same Mercy had dropped and it was not just staying there but that vessel was carrying God God's mercy to others Hallelujah so you find in this right here that every time the devil raises his head you know what he's trying to do to get you to shut up he's trying to get you to just tap down just just be quiet you're all worked up you're all riled up let me just tell you something don't ever be foolish enough to make a deal with the devil he'll never keep his end of the deal if he tells you he'll let up on you don't you believe him he won't let up on you he'll keep going because if you keep giving he'll keep taking what God has rightfully given to you but when Trouble Comes that's the time to stand in that time and realize it's Satan trying to distract you from the promise that's the right response and the mercy now notice the Philippi and Jailer here they are thrown in jail Paul and Silas verse 25 and in midnight Paul and Silas were Facebooking and instagramming and tweeting of what a bad deal they received that must be the updated version I don't know you think they listen they themselves had done nothing but good for that woman and that City that's right and they were thrown in jail now I'm going to tell you they had to have it had to be the love of God in their heart to where they did not look upon those men with disdain because I don't care how much they sing I don't care how much they clap their hands God would have never tapped his foot come on somebody God just not tapy God wasn't going to come down and say man that's some good worship and he said but I'm I'm I'm hearing these songs going to be a meeting in the air but Hallelujah it sound right doesn't sound right what's it sound like Lord it sounds like a grudges down there oh see God can't tap his foot you say brother Samuel what what about a grudge if you can just let God dissolve and take away Grudge and bitterness and indifference then I'll tell you the spirit of God will break down the walls in your life he'll break down barriers but it starts with the right response Lord I've got a grudge Lord I've got bitterness Lord I've got indifference Lord I've got sin Lord I need help Lord oh you begin to get in harmony with his song with his word oh there begins to be notes that are falling from on high the Angels begin to take their position position and here God begins to Pat his foot and said listen to my children down there singing to me there's victory in their life well they don't look that Victorious they're down there in prison oh no you don't understand they have not allowed when those men threw them in jail they have not allowed that to affect their attitude they still are a vessel of [Music] Mercy Hallelujah woo glory be to God oh my say thank you Lord tap into that Lord tap into that amen and all of a sudden that man look he knew he was in trouble when that earthquake and them doors open he knew he was in trouble brother JHU way he went ahead and Drew the sword he was ready to take his life it's done I'm my life's over and all of a sudden Mercy reaches out hey don't take your life we're all here we're all here and notice that man says sir verse 30 what must I do to be saved we do not have any any record here that Paul and them preached around that prison they were just there of that night we don't have that record but you understand it's the life yes amen God's presence that flame that was burning in their life caus that man to recognize there's something different about these guys believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved in thy house and they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house you catch this each one of these times you'll find in many of these cases in the book of Acts even when Cornelius was receiving the word he got all his Kinsmen together got all his friends together he got those that was dear to him because he knew we need to hear this notice how the house comes together he took up the same hour of the night washed their stripes was baptized he and all his straight way hey it's dark out here that's all right just hold up just hold up that little that light right there there's water right here I my desire is is to express or to accept God's mercy why don't you wait till tomorrow nope I can't wait till tomorrow I want his Mercy to be joined with my life right now and when he had brought them into his house oh no another one he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in God with all his house you see what an effect it is to invite the word into your life amen then you invite it into your homeall invited in for every decision yes amen it's no longer a book on the shelf that we take off or laying on the coffee table but now that same author of the book and our lives are Spirit bearing record with his spirit and his word he's the guide of my life for the decisions that we're going to make I may not have it wrote out right here thus sayith the Lord Thou shalt not do this or Thou shalt move here or Thou shalt do it may not but you know what I'm tied to that absolute of almighty God that he knows me knows right where I'm at and he knows the decisions that I have to make in life and Lord let me be influenced by you that's why I want that Mercy to be so I want to be so joined with it it'll Lead Me influence me and guide me do you love him this morning amen hallelujah let me just can I read a couple more quotes to you I'm going to close I just want you I'm read these and want you just let them drop here for a minute brother Bram says to the congregation he says and just once more Lord you're fine he said I've enjoyed the congregations your fine response to the ministry to the messages great things that God has done for us it's just unlimited we'll never know what it's meant until we cross the other side because seed has been planted that will come to life in the days ahead of us see the confidence in the word when the seed has been planted it may not be at that moment that it comes to life but when that seed has been received a promise of God and is watered it will will come to life it will come to life notice he goes on for those who rais their hands to Christ for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and many things The Works of Grace that you desired God to work on with you I trust that every one of You' be filled with the Holy Ghost everyone don't forget my message on the token he said you must stay with it remember display the token Mighty God unveil before us he says we must become more dedicated we must must believe every word of God and we must seek everybody say seek seek until that word is made real to us and the message doors IND door and this is these are just some things that just been some burden and I had no idea how Lord was going to take it had no matter of fact I just had a note I'm just just speak from my heart right now I just had a note that I've had out for a little bit a little while and it was just a note to speak to the congregation on responding to the word responding in the service and the after service now I I'll tell you it's I to me I don't love preaching I love preaching here more than I love preaching anywhere else this is my home this is home it's a liberty to preach the word of God I'm thankful that other other ministers they come and they feel the same way to do that but that's you know what that's because of hearts and lives that want to glean and draw on the word of God it ain't the temperature it ain't the music it's because of hearts that love God let me tell you something you realize if there's only three hearts that love God three hearts sitting in a room of a hundred can make a man of God feel at home come on God doesn't have to have a crowd God God does not have to do that God can take just a few hearts that are in tune with him and they there gets to start working together like a body it will have an effect upon the rest of the others that are joined in there that's why listen to me don't be looking at one another well well this one needs to do this and and this one needs to respond listen friends I'll tell you what we need to do we need to join our licks together and say God let the Holy Ghost so move right here Among Us continue to move that hearts and life it will create an atmosphere like the prophet said in the token that they'll just drop right into itall that's what I want don't you let's just join our our our hearts together with that that's one way for us to respond hallu amen because sometimes even when the Lord I know many times and I I'm just going to I'm just just speaking here just kind of a little bit of counsel many times I know sometimes you you'll hear me say anybody would like prayer let let me just tell you this you don't ever have to wait for me to say does anybody want prayer right if you ever want prayer or you need prayer right you come that's right you don't have to wait for me or anyone else to say the altar is open right well brother Samuel the altar well I'm not guilty of sin you don't always come sometimes you come to the altar not because you're guilty of sin sometimes you come to the altar you just want to say Lord I just want to let you know I'm thankful I mean I can let you I can I can say thank you in my seat but you know I'm just so moved Lord I I just want to say thank you you know when they would go to offer Thanksgiving to the Lord enter into his Gates enter his courts with Thanksgiving that is one of the things where they would take what God had blessed them with and sit down and eat that with the priest everybody with me amen I'm talking about a simple response CU sometimes we can become so technical sometimes you and let me tell you there's a lot of voices there's a lot of voices and and this and voices saying oh we're we're Beyond prayer lines that's it's nonsense we're not Beyond prayer lines amen I you see certain things where people they want to take certain things and take quotes and I listen friends I'm not I'm not the authority on this but I'll tell you what is God's word God's word not just taking one quote here and cherry picking them but let's look through the whole message because it's not going to contrary one to the other now to my heart my heart when I look at it we want to respond as God moves on our heart we want to respond to his Mercy not saying Lord I'm above all that I'm above this or I'm above that neither am I trying to get you to an altar neither am I trying to get you to come and stand up here but I am telling you this when God moves on your heart be obedient to him that's and listen listen no more you don't have to ask me can I come here to the altar can I come and be prayed for you don't have to ask me that no more than you have to ask me can you go visit another church hallu come on friends now let me read this let me read two more quotes you said Brother Sam you said two I want to read these two and drop them for you how many believe the after service is important and I know I've went a little longer here into that after service today but I wanted to drop this to us brother brm says now as we sing slowly now doors and door 1965 from the bottom of your heart you know after a scouring scolding message I think it's good to get in the spirit and sing the sweetness of the Holy Spirit sometimes I wonder how much that we miss because we get in such a hurry we get in such a hurry to leave now I and listen I I understand I understand sometimes there's schedules I I get that friends but if we could think of any of us if there's any of us if there's anything within us could think could I do things a little differently instead of coming this extreme time could I well attack a little bit more at the end what I'm just asking that we would really consider that and just just think about these things so I'm not sitting here taking notes who's leaving early y'all with me that's not what I'm saying this so don't take it that way I'm just saying that sometimes it's just brother brand would say it over and over after the seed gets planted it's important for the water to come on it it's important for that water to come upon that seed and just water it in real good in the message inside brother Bram talks about the early church and in that second paragraph he says concerning that early church he says they would raise up their hands after some godly man gave a message and they raised up their hands and praised God they loved the after effects of the Holy Spirit bathing through them don't you love the after effects don't you love it the Lord is so mindful of us we want to respond to his Mercy when God deals with your heart look it don't have to be me standing here preaching you it's important that you catch that it's God and when God's speaking to you respond to his Mercy say Lord here here here's my cup Lord here's my life Lord I I I Lord I I give it to you and Lord like Lydia like the Philippian Jailer I want to take home with me right what I've received I want to carry it into my home if you've judged me faithful Lord let it so drop in my life to where Lord I I want to see it made flesh in me I I I want to I want to dedicate myself to this word more Lord I want to seek Until It's Made Real Lord I I I want to rededicate but R would say it over and over he says how many of you feel like me Lord I'm going to rededicate myself after hearing this word I say Lord Jesus Grant it I tell you friends it's no no better time when the Holy Spirit deals with you maybe on water baptism maybe you've never you've never given your heart to God maybe You' have never received the Holy Ghost let me just tell you you respond to him as he speaks to you because what that is it's God creating it's a faith that then when you step out you're stepping on a promise where God himself has given you a faith to actually believe that promise so it's not a man it's not somebody else it's between you and God let me just say this don't let don't let a moment pass you by if you look in your life and say I don't really brother Samuel I don't believe I've really got that that fire where the things of the world have been cleansed out of my heart and my life and Christ my love is to him and him alone where there's a genuine faith in the word of God there is a Grace in your life that gives you the strength the desires of the world are gone the desire of the world is gone and your only desire is I want to please him that that's your love and Devotion to Christ and if that's if that's not there why don't you just say Lord Jesus who's rich and mercy Lord as you've come near my life I want to be joined with that Mercy I want Lord God to where my life will match like that laundry ticket I want it to match perfectly Lord because I need your mercy to help me as an overcomer I need your mercy daily in my life Hallelujah you love him Hallelujah let's just let's bow our heads in a word of prayer maybe as we're we could stand and maybe could we just pray for one another as we're joined together lay hands on one another in a respectful way brother to sister brother to brother this is absolutely fitting as well we've looking in his word and we lord we just so want to to have we want to respond to the mercy of God that's being shown to us let's just let's pray together I want you to pray for the one that you've got your hands upon Heavenly Father Lord as we just come Lord God into your presence in this moment Lord father you see Lord the needs Lord of each
