[40:42] amen so we just let's turn to the word
[40:44] of the lord a song of solomon chapter
[40:46] eight and verse five
[40:48] and i just want to read these through
[40:49] verses of scripture
[40:52] just on this past monday morning i just
[40:54] just as i just was waking up that just
[40:57] these scriptures just moved right into
[41:00] my heart just and the prince of god just
[41:02] just came right there in the bedroom
[41:05] just
[41:06] just as i was awakening and these
[41:08] scriptures i just want to
[41:09] just how god would express it and i
[41:12] always trust
[41:14] my prayer is this lord help me that i
[41:16] can express it the way
[41:18] that you brought it to me if you'll just
[41:20] deliver it that way you know in prayer
[41:22] and
[41:23] that's always the desire is lord just
[41:26] let me get out of the way the way you
[41:27] brought it
[41:28] so here is the scripture verse five who
[41:31] is this
[41:32] that cometh up from the wilderness
[41:35] leaning upon her beloved
[41:39] this is speaking of the bride i raised
[41:42] thee up
[41:43] under the apple tree
[41:46] there thy mother brought before there
[41:49] she brought thee forth
[41:50] that bear thee set me
[41:54] this is the from the bridegroom set me
[41:57] as a seal upon thine heart
[42:01] as a seal upon thine arm so this is the
[42:05] request
[42:07] set me as a seal as remember what a seal
[42:10] is
[42:10] it's a finished work it's it signifies
[42:14] that one belongs to another
[42:18] and upon thine arm thy strength let me
[42:21] be the strength of your life
[42:24] for love is strong as death
[42:27] jealousy is cruel as the grave
[42:30] the coals thereof are coals of fire
[42:32] which
[42:33] hath the most vehement flame many waters
[42:38] cannot quench love
[42:41] so if you can't quench it neither can
[42:43] the floods
[42:45] drown it if a man would give
[42:49] all the substance of his house
[42:52] for love it would utterly be
[42:55] content in other words despise
[42:59] not even not even coming close to being
[43:03] equal
[43:04] for love if a man would give all
[43:07] of his substance for love
[43:10] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[43:13] of the word as you're being seated
[43:19] truly the love of god when we to think
[43:22] of it
[43:24] there's no way that in our in a person
[43:28] in our natural mind that we could ever
[43:30] be able to
[43:31] fully um within our minds be able to
[43:34] comprehend the love of god
[43:37] but it but the love of god is meant to
[43:39] be that which
[43:41] is captured not with our mind but with
[43:44] our heart
[43:46] to think that when as the scripture
[43:48] would would express this here
[43:51] of the greatness of love now you know
[43:54] love itself is a very it's a very
[43:56] powerful force brother branham would say
[43:58] it in this way he would say it's the
[44:00] most
[44:00] powerful force there is on earth
[44:04] because he gives the examples of how
[44:07] that love that he says you could see
[44:09] how that a mother would actually
[44:12] move right through flames of fire in
[44:16] order to rescue
[44:17] her child i never forget one time we
[44:20] were
[44:20] as a family we were on vacation and
[44:25] we were there i was i was there with the
[44:26] boys and we were just we were just kind
[44:28] of
[44:29] just swimming around there and here
[44:32] i think it was benjamin if i'm not
[44:34] mistaken we weren't even
[44:36] in really deep water but but benjamin
[44:38] wasn't as tall as he is now
[44:41] but you know and i was right there with
[44:42] the boys and and all of a sudden
[44:44] in the moment it's my wife turn she
[44:47] turned around and here benjamin he's
[44:48] just kind of
[44:49] bobbing a little bit there was nothing
[44:52] her shoes came off in record breaking
[44:54] time she jumped in closing off
[44:57] and she fit i mean it was though as he
[44:58] was in the middle of the pool
[45:00] she went from the edge completely to the
[45:02] middle it's like she walked on water
[45:05] but what did that it was love
[45:08] she saw that her child was in need
[45:11] and it drove her to that she didn't
[45:14] think about whoa what if this
[45:16] this dress gets ruined and chlorine and
[45:18] everything didn't even think about that
[45:19] didn't even come into the picture
[45:21] love is such a very it's the most
[45:23] powerful force to think of it that
[45:26] in that regards that when we're looking
[45:28] at it that's a filial love that's a love
[45:31] that a mother would have
[45:32] for children it's a love that between
[45:35] husband and wife
[45:36] of filial love and that's a very very
[45:39] tremendous
[45:40] uh very tremendous thing because love
[45:43] itself
[45:44] love must be projected if if love is not
[45:47] projected then
[45:49] then there could be nothing come forth
[45:51] from it you know
[45:52] the bible says in order for you to have
[45:54] friends
[45:55] you must show yourself friendly and if
[45:58] you know how it is is
[46:00] once in a while with your husband and
[46:02] wife or children
[46:03] it is very it is very good to express
[46:06] our love now when we we could go through
[46:09] that in many ways but you see
[46:11] love is is not meant is meant to be
[46:15] expressed it's projected but there's a
[46:17] desire within that projection
[46:19] to think that you know where the love
[46:22] would be
[46:23] uh projected you know uh to
[46:26] husband and wife and and to that of a
[46:29] family but yet
[46:30] here god's own love as we are
[46:33] looking at this that his love projected
[46:36] it into the world it produced a savior
[46:40] when love love being projected then it
[46:43] allowed
[46:44] grace to step in and grace to actually
[46:47] bring into reality what love had
[46:50] projected
[46:51] in love itself there's nothing that
[46:53] nothing more strong than love to think
[46:55] of it
[46:56] love itself will make you trust amen
[47:00] love will make you trust real love
[47:02] brings real trust
[47:05] and love itself let me say this love is
[47:08] a risk
[47:11] it's a risk it's nothing that
[47:14] that that that it's something we say
[47:16] well i'm going to get it all on paper
[47:17] and i'm going to
[47:18] have this all wrote out that's not love
[47:22] but love it but it's worth the risk
[47:26] it's worth the risk to think of it that
[47:28] god
[47:29] when god himself become one of us now
[47:32] this was not a haphazard plan god came
[47:35] himself
[47:36] it was the love of god that brought him
[47:40] down to the earth to become one of us
[47:43] in order to redeem you and i and give
[47:47] us the life that we had before the fall
[47:50] it was love that constrained him to do
[47:53] it
[47:54] and how that he himself would adorn even
[47:58] the robe of humanity and to to
[48:02] feel even the temptation to feel what it
[48:05] was
[48:05] to be frustrated to feel what it was to
[48:08] be sick
[48:09] in all of that he he took upon
[48:12] in order that he might be the right kind
[48:15] of a high priest for you and i
[48:17] that he could be touched by the feeling
[48:20] of our infirmities
[48:21] to where when we and ourselves would get
[48:24] weak
[48:24] he's there to minister on our behalf to
[48:27] minister
[48:28] strength and encouragement to our lives
[48:32] and so this this love is just as so
[48:35] powerful it brings about
[48:37] of a real of a real trust and you know
[48:41] when you think about it you know brother
[48:43] branham would say it in this way says
[48:44] you know there's things where he says
[48:46] you can belong to a great
[48:48] church and he says you might be a
[48:50] charter member
[48:51] in that church and yet just being a
[48:54] member
[48:54] you would do things that you normally
[48:57] would not
[48:58] do or that you would not do if you
[49:00] belong
[49:01] somewhere he said to a church he said
[49:04] and you have the love of god
[49:06] in your heart you see what makes
[49:09] a person different what is it that makes
[49:13] a christian
[49:14] a christian is the love of
[49:17] god that has come into their heart
[49:20] and this is where jesus what he would
[49:22] say in john 15
[49:24] 9 here he is speaking to the disciples
[49:27] and he says
[49:28] as the father hath loved me so
[49:31] have i loved you
[49:34] continue continue ye
[49:37] in my love so it's to abide to remain
[49:41] to tarry so to walk within this love
[49:44] if you keep my commandments you shall
[49:47] abide in my love
[49:50] even as i have kept my father's
[49:52] commandments
[49:53] and abide in his love so god's love
[49:56] is directly tied to his life
[50:00] to his word and as we as keeping those
[50:04] the commandments of the word and listen
[50:06] i don't want you to think this morning
[50:08] if you think
[50:08] commandments are just a written code of
[50:11] rules
[50:12] you're missing the commandments is that
[50:15] there's a divine expression it's god's
[50:18] word
[50:19] that is coming forth to minister to our
[50:21] hearts
[50:22] to lead us and to guide us and he says
[50:24] if you will keep my commandments now
[50:27] remember this is something that it's up
[50:29] to you and i
[50:31] he's speaking to the disciples well
[50:33] before the holy ghost has come
[50:35] but he's giving them what is absolutely
[50:38] not just them but for
[50:40] you and i what is absolutely necessary
[50:43] in order to walk into the baptism of the
[50:46] holy ghost where
[50:47] the love of god is shed abroad in your
[50:49] heart and
[50:51] it's also the same reality of how that
[50:54] we are to
[50:55] serve god live for god be pleasing to
[50:58] the lord
[50:59] and that is that the word as the word is
[51:02] coming
[51:03] when the desire in our hearts should be
[51:04] god let me be
[51:06] a sponge lord to that word let it be an
[51:10] absorption lord
[51:11] in my life because he's not talking
[51:13] about us keeping it here
[51:15] we could keep it here but god let the
[51:18] life
[51:18] of the word let it so pass into my life
[51:22] let it change me let it transform my
[51:24] life
[51:25] when i'm here i'm hearing the word let
[51:28] it be
[51:28] that life that's coming that's just so
[51:31] penetrating
[51:32] beyond everything lord and having
[51:35] preeminence
[51:36] in my life that's keeping the
[51:38] commandments
[51:39] is ourselves just giving ourselves to
[51:42] him
[51:42] and in doing that he says eve you shall
[51:45] abide in my love
[51:46] even as i have kept my father's
[51:50] commandments
[51:51] and abide in his love so this the love
[51:54] of god
[51:55] is god making known his word
[52:00] are you with me so god's god making
[52:04] known his word
[52:05] is his love now there's times god makes
[52:07] it on his word
[52:08] and it'll cut and there's other times
[52:11] but it's not always cutting
[52:14] god doesn't delight it in all his
[52:15] cutting but there's other parts
[52:18] how the word is coming it's there
[52:20] because the bible says
[52:21] instruction in righteousness it comes to
[52:25] uh guidance and directness so as we
[52:29] would take that word remember when jesus
[52:31] was here he says
[52:32] the father loveth the son and
[52:35] showeth him all things is that right
[52:38] so the word coming to you and i the word
[52:42] being spoken to our hearts
[52:43] that is the love of god being expressed
[52:45] to you and i and you might sit here and
[52:47] say
[52:48] how do i know that he loves me is he
[52:50] speaking to you
[52:52] if he's speaking to you that's him
[52:54] letting you know
[52:56] he loves you see it's god
[52:59] by his word speaking to our hearts
[53:02] now notice he says these things have i
[53:04] spoken unto you
[53:06] that my joy might remain
[53:09] in you and that your joy
[53:13] might be full now the bible says
[53:17] the fear of the lord is the is the
[53:20] beginning of wisdom
[53:21] a good understanding have all they that
[53:24] do
[53:25] his commandments his praise and do it
[53:28] forevermore
[53:29] revelations 22 14 says blessed are they
[53:32] that
[53:33] do his commandments so it's not just
[53:36] as we're hearing it but there must be a
[53:39] hearing
[53:40] but it's yielding to what we're hearing
[53:42] yielding to that voice
[53:44] and god is not asking you and i to make
[53:47] it happen
[53:48] he's only asking you and i as we read in
[53:51] the beginning
[53:52] set me as a seal he's asking you and i
[53:55] give me my place give me place
[53:58] in your life give me that place that
[54:00] belongs to me
[54:01] and let me just tell you as a believer
[54:04] that
[54:05] never ever stops the word itself
[54:09] is finding its place within our life
[54:12] it's a word
[54:13] to where the word you know the bible
[54:15] says in meekness you know the very word
[54:17] meekness
[54:18] it means to give place to one and the
[54:20] bible said moses
[54:22] was the meekest man in all the world in
[54:24] all the earth why
[54:25] he gave the rightful place to the word
[54:28] in his
[54:29] life it brings out a real meekness
[54:32] because
[54:32] we are not trying to put him there we
[54:35] give him
[54:36] his rightful place so
[54:39] blessed are they that do his
[54:41] commandments remember
[54:42] when jesus stood in acts 1 he spoke to
[54:45] the disciples
[54:46] after his resurrection he was there with
[54:48] them commanding
[54:50] them many things for 40 days he was
[54:52] giving order
[54:53] giving direction to their life and the
[54:56] last
[54:57] words that he spoke before he ascended
[55:00] the bible says he commanded them that
[55:03] they
[55:04] go to jerusalem and be endued
[55:07] with power from on high this is what the
[55:10] word
[55:11] spoke to them because this is now
[55:14] where now the word itself and you now
[55:18] become one so notice they had to receive
[55:22] that
[55:22] if if they hadn't received it they'd
[55:24] have never been in the upper room
[55:26] are you with me if they never had if
[55:28] they hadn't have sin
[55:30] received that word they would have never
[55:32] been in the upper room
[55:34] but showing they had received the word
[55:37] they went to the upper room are you with
[55:39] me now
[55:40] brother branham tells us like this he
[55:42] says when you take that seed word
[55:44] into your heart and then you walk into
[55:47] the holiest of holies
[55:48] it'll bring forth shoe bread manna
[55:51] this is why listen to me not just in the
[55:54] new birth but
[55:55] even after you've been born again
[55:57] there's times you're setting
[55:58] you're hearing the word you're listening
[56:00] to it and it might
[56:01] seem like oh i don't seem like i'm
[56:03] grasping at all i don't seem like i'm
[56:05] grasping at all but if you're open to
[56:07] that word
[56:08] you're yielding to that word let me
[56:10] remind you the word
[56:11] of god is a seed and in that seed
[56:14] it has transforming power it has the
[56:17] authority
[56:18] to become what he spoke it you say what
[56:20] do i do
[56:21] take it in his heart take it in your
[56:23] heart and then as you come
[56:24] into his presence you watch and his
[56:27] presence doesn't mean
[56:28] that you necessarily have to be right
[56:30] here on a thursday or a sunday
[56:33] right in service but you're taking that
[56:35] word in let me tell you
[56:36] you are a priest unto god you can be
[56:39] walking right down the middle of the
[56:40] store
[56:41] walking right out in your lawn and
[56:43] you're there in the presence of almighty
[56:46] god
[56:47] because it's him that's there and about
[56:49] that time
[56:50] that seed word you've taken in it ripens
[56:53] in his presence because his presence
[56:57] brings his faith his presence his
[57:00] life so we want to take the word
[57:04] in our hearts david said i hid it in my
[57:06] heart
[57:09] jesus said in john 17.
[57:12] this is his request father i will that
[57:15] they also whom thou
[57:16] has given me notice has given me
[57:20] he's not just speaking of the disciples
[57:24] who's there
[57:25] but all that has been given him from
[57:28] before the foundation of the world jesus
[57:30] said no man can come to me
[57:32] except my father draw him
[57:35] whom thou has given me be with me where
[57:38] i am that they may behold
[57:40] my glory which thou has given me for
[57:43] thou
[57:43] lovest me before the foundation of the
[57:45] world
[57:46] o righteous father the world hath not
[57:49] known thee
[57:50] but i have known thee and these have
[57:53] known that thou
[57:54] hast sent me and i have declared unto
[57:58] them
[57:58] thy name and will declare it
[58:02] that the love wherewith thou hast
[58:05] loved me may be in them and i
[58:09] in them remember when he walked when he
[58:12] came out they were walking on the road
[58:14] to emmaus in luke 24.
[58:16] they were sad they were they were just
[58:19] we thought he was the one
[58:21] we thought he was the one that should
[58:22] have redeemed israel
[58:25] they missed and they were at that time
[58:29] not revealed to them the need
[58:33] for suffering you see it was
[58:36] it they could not continue in the same
[58:39] life
[58:40] they were in that same life they were in
[58:43] peter walked with him and then peter
[58:46] peter backslid
[58:47] is that right and peter rejected him so
[58:50] they so there was a need
[58:52] for a fulfillment there was a need for
[58:55] that
[58:55] life to come that would bring stability
[58:59] that peter alone could not give to
[59:01] himself nor the rest of the disciples
[59:03] there had to be a clarity a revelation
[59:07] of who he was and the work of redemption
[59:10] so it would stabilize them
[59:12] and give them a confidence in the
[59:14] promise that god had for them
[59:16] and then when god himself would so
[59:19] transmit his life in them
[59:21] it would produce a courage it would
[59:23] produce a confidence
[59:25] it would produce a trust let me tell you
[59:26] what kind of trust it produced
[59:28] it produced a trust to where when god
[59:30] said something in his word
[59:32] they just believed it because god said
[59:34] it
[59:36] they didn't need proof of it god said it
[59:39] i believe it
[59:40] that settles it when paul was getting
[59:43] ready
[59:43] and they thought it was they thought
[59:44] they were going to be sunk there one
[59:47] when he was going to rome
[59:48] but he said the angel of the lord whose
[59:50] servant i am
[59:51] he stood before me this night and he
[59:54] begins to rehearse these things
[59:56] and he said be of good cheer
[59:59] there shall not be a man lost but that
[1:00:02] he would abide
[1:00:03] in the ship let me tell you they they
[1:00:05] operated
[1:00:06] on a trust and a confidence because they
[1:00:09] knew
[1:00:09] who he was they themselves were
[1:00:12] witnesses
[1:00:13] of the power and authority let me tell
[1:00:15] you something what would put them out
[1:00:17] there
[1:00:18] to where they would preach the gospel
[1:00:19] that way they would they dared they
[1:00:22] went out there and they they stood there
[1:00:24] in the face of the enemy and declared
[1:00:27] the reality of jesus christ let me tell
[1:00:29] you what i'll do that
[1:00:30] the same thing that it does inside of
[1:00:32] you when you stand there
[1:00:33] day after day right in the midst of
[1:00:36] satan's
[1:00:36] eating and you stand there it's not you
[1:00:39] living that life
[1:00:40] it's christ inside of you
[1:00:46] hallelujah that this same love where you
[1:00:49] have loved me
[1:00:53] that this same love may be
[1:00:56] in them and i in
[1:00:59] them remember
[1:01:04] jesus said saturn was moments ago
[1:01:08] he said the father loveth me and he
[1:01:10] showeth me
[1:01:11] these things jesus goes on to say the
[1:01:15] father loveth me
[1:01:17] because i lay my life down now think of
[1:01:20] this listen
[1:01:21] jesus was not meriting the love of god
[1:01:25] but the love of god was so preeminent
[1:01:30] in this in this vessel this
[1:01:32] predestinated seed of god
[1:01:35] are you with me it was so preeminent in
[1:01:38] his life to where god was made visible
[1:01:42] the invisible god was made visible
[1:01:45] through his life
[1:01:46] it was god speaking to him and him
[1:01:49] yielding to the voice of god and as he
[1:01:53] would go
[1:01:53] forth he would go walking that word that
[1:01:56] was being fulfilled
[1:01:57] it was the father that dwelt in him that
[1:02:00] was fulfilling the word
[1:02:02] but he had to yield to the voice he
[1:02:05] yield to what he was being shown
[1:02:07] and he walked in obedience to that word
[1:02:10] and that word was fulfilled even where
[1:02:12] jesus could say
[1:02:14] i have power to lay my life down he said
[1:02:17] this is the very thing that the father
[1:02:19] he loveth before you know what the
[1:02:20] laying down it's more than just
[1:02:22] you say well there was there at calvary
[1:02:24] look every moment of his life
[1:02:26] it was a laying down every part of his
[1:02:30] life
[1:02:31] was yielding laying down laying down
[1:02:33] when they wanted
[1:02:34] him to go to the tomb of lazarus come on
[1:02:37] your buddy he's sick
[1:02:38] he's he's past he's close to death come
[1:02:41] on this is your buddy
[1:02:42] they were trying to pull him and no
[1:02:45] doubt he felt the temptation
[1:02:47] in the gate of affection out here in his
[1:02:49] spirit
[1:02:50] but down on the inside the love of god
[1:02:53] would stand there
[1:02:54] upon god's word and god's word alone and
[1:02:57] he waited until
[1:02:58] he had the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:03:01] on what to do in that moment
[1:03:03] what was he doing laying down his life
[1:03:06] he laid down his will he had a right for
[1:03:08] many things he had a right to be married
[1:03:10] he had a right for all that but he said
[1:03:12] father
[1:03:13] i sanctify myself for their sake
[1:03:16] so this life being laid down it had
[1:03:19] nothing to do
[1:03:20] of a selfish motive but it had
[1:03:22] everything to do
[1:03:23] for that of his brethren for the family
[1:03:26] of god
[1:03:27] for the word of god
[1:03:32] same love so it calls us to the same
[1:03:35] thing
[1:03:36] first john 4 verse 14 here the scripture
[1:03:39] says we have seen
[1:03:42] and do testify that the father
[1:03:46] sent the son to be the savior of the
[1:03:49] world
[1:03:51] i want you to just pay pay close
[1:03:52] attention these words we have seen
[1:03:55] and do testify that the father sent the
[1:03:58] son
[1:03:59] to be the savior of the world whosoever
[1:04:02] shall confess that jesus is the son of
[1:04:06] god
[1:04:06] god dwelleth in him
[1:04:10] and he in god now we know this
[1:04:12] confession this has got to be something
[1:04:14] that's just
[1:04:15] deeper than just the mouth but it's got
[1:04:18] to be something to where
[1:04:19] there's a life behind it that confesses
[1:04:22] that jesus christ is the lord it
[1:04:26] comes from seeing and testifying and
[1:04:28] believing
[1:04:29] and now it's a life that confesses what
[1:04:31] they have saw
[1:04:32] what they have come in contact with and
[1:04:35] we have known
[1:04:36] and believed the love that god
[1:04:39] hath to us oh my this is personal
[1:04:44] amen we have known
[1:04:47] that means had an experience
[1:04:52] known we've we've had an experience
[1:04:55] and believed the love that god hath to
[1:04:58] us
[1:04:59] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:05:02] dwelleth in god and god in
[1:05:06] him the bible says in verse 17
[1:05:10] herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:05:12] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:05:14] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:05:18] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:05:21] love cast
[1:05:22] out fear because fear hath torment he
[1:05:25] that feareth
[1:05:26] is not made perfect in love we love him
[1:05:29] because he first loved us
[1:05:33] i'm just going to move here for sake of
[1:05:35] time on some things and maybe god will
[1:05:37] help us to come back in a different time
[1:05:40] but look at it how that paul would bring
[1:05:42] this here
[1:05:43] in ephesians 5 ephesians 5 verse 1 paul
[1:05:46] said be
[1:05:47] therefore followers that means imitators
[1:05:52] we know what it means to be an imitator
[1:05:55] is that right
[1:05:56] it means you you are watching somebody
[1:06:00] you can see them you can't if you don't
[1:06:02] see them you can't imitate him
[1:06:04] is that right but when you see him then
[1:06:07] you can imitate him
[1:06:09] so this is how paul said this is how how
[1:06:11] you're to be
[1:06:12] a follower of god followers of god
[1:06:15] imitators
[1:06:16] as dear children what's a child doing a
[1:06:18] child's doing everything daddy does
[1:06:21] daddy daddy does this i mean daddy's got
[1:06:23] the axe it's got its little little
[1:06:25] tights axe you know or
[1:06:28] or mama's broom handle something
[1:06:31] it imitates are you with me amen now
[1:06:33] notice this
[1:06:35] and walk in love has christ hath loved
[1:06:39] us to walk our life to be regulated and
[1:06:42] hath
[1:06:42] given himself oh glory for us
[1:06:46] an offering and a sacrifice to god
[1:06:50] for a sweet smelling savior so
[1:06:53] our life walking with him yielding our
[1:06:55] life to him
[1:06:57] giving over to him notice brother brown
[1:06:59] would say it like this let me refer to
[1:07:01] this he says
[1:07:02] now if you're believing right i want you
[1:07:04] to hold on to this thought
[1:07:05] if you're believing right if you just
[1:07:08] confess it
[1:07:09] with your lips it won't do much good but
[1:07:12] from your heart i mean you know the
[1:07:14] scripture says if a man
[1:07:16] a man believeth from the heart unto
[1:07:19] righteousness
[1:07:20] is that right so it's god the very first
[1:07:22] work it's god working on that heart
[1:07:25] amen and sometimes that work on the
[1:07:28] heart
[1:07:28] is not something that you all together
[1:07:31] see
[1:07:32] i'm talking about even out for our lives
[1:07:35] and what we have experienced you don't
[1:07:37] all together whether it's children or
[1:07:39] whoever it may be
[1:07:39] you don't all together see that
[1:07:41] sometimes maybe a loved one somebody
[1:07:43] you're praying for
[1:07:44] and it might seem like man i don't think
[1:07:45] like anything's taking place
[1:07:47] but remember here remember when we're
[1:07:49] looking at this god deals with the heart
[1:07:52] first if god dealt with the body
[1:07:56] as just as far as just the body and the
[1:07:58] mind you can have somebody coming
[1:08:00] in the body and in the mind and their
[1:08:01] hearts not in it
[1:08:04] but god before the prodigal ever
[1:08:07] came home before he ever made one
[1:08:11] step out of the pigpen are you hearing
[1:08:14] me
[1:08:15] his heart was being turned
[1:08:19] daddy didn't know it mama didn't know it
[1:08:22] but his heart was being
[1:08:24] turned why because there was a father
[1:08:27] and a mother who were praying for him
[1:08:30] and the prophet said the angel of god
[1:08:34] went to the pigpen that night that's why
[1:08:36] i'm telling you
[1:08:37] to turn the heart if you find yourself
[1:08:40] my heart
[1:08:40] beginning to turn beginning to open
[1:08:42] there's things that you find
[1:08:44] that my goodness brother samuel you
[1:08:46] would have never found me here you would
[1:08:47] have never thought that let me just let
[1:08:49] you know
[1:08:50] that's not a work of flesh and blood
[1:08:53] that's a
[1:08:54] supernatural work of the same angel of
[1:08:57] the lord
[1:08:57] that's on earth tonight he's the one
[1:09:00] dealing with your life
[1:09:04] hallelujah amen
[1:09:07] glory be to god but if from your heart
[1:09:10] you believe that jesus is the son of god
[1:09:12] you can't
[1:09:13] live the same life you once lived you
[1:09:16] can't
[1:09:16] if you ever get a true view of calvary
[1:09:19] how many is thankful for a true view of
[1:09:21] calvary
[1:09:23] if you're just taking some haphazard way
[1:09:25] or just you're just fooling yourself but
[1:09:27] when you really get a view of what jesus
[1:09:29] was
[1:09:30] oh he said how i'd like to preach the
[1:09:32] supreme deity of jesus
[1:09:34] christ if you could ever realize who he
[1:09:37] was
[1:09:38] and what he did for you
[1:09:44] he did it all
[1:09:49] you say what do i have to do yield
[1:09:52] believe it accept it he
[1:09:56] did it oh
[1:09:59] your hearts notice your hearts would
[1:10:02] rend
[1:10:03] within you and you'd be willing to throw
[1:10:06] away
[1:10:06] the trash of the world to live for him
[1:10:09] notice getting a view of him
[1:10:11] will do what caused the trash to be
[1:10:14] thrown aside
[1:10:15] because there's something so much
[1:10:16] greater and you're i'm asked to give up
[1:10:18] this for this
[1:10:19] no problem it's not even in comparison
[1:10:22] on the scales
[1:10:26] oh he says how marvelous what a person
[1:10:28] if you realize the condescending of god
[1:10:30] himself
[1:10:30] unfolding himself coming down till he
[1:10:33] could get
[1:10:34] in your heart now
[1:10:39] when we look here in romans 6 and as we
[1:10:41] get ready to look at this here in romans
[1:10:43] 6.
[1:10:45] brother i'm taking it at the very end of
[1:10:47] the message the token there in
[1:10:48] jeffersonville
[1:10:50] brother brown begins to guide the people
[1:10:52] as they're standing there
[1:10:54] he says that those who said you want to
[1:10:56] receive this token and he's
[1:10:58] he's giving them guidance of what to say
[1:11:01] even in that moment and it's a pouring
[1:11:04] out of their heart it's just simply
[1:11:05] being very honest before god
[1:11:07] let me just let me see if i can find it
[1:11:09] here so i can read it to you
[1:11:10] i referred to it and i don't have it
[1:11:12] right there in front of me is that okay
[1:11:14] listen what he says listen here's the
[1:11:16] simplicity of it
[1:11:18] he said this is what you say lord jesus
[1:11:21] right now
[1:11:22] just take all that's in me that's unlike
[1:11:25] you
[1:11:26] let me move all my pride all that's
[1:11:29] in me out all the trash
[1:11:32] all the unbelief that's in me i discard
[1:11:35] it now lord
[1:11:36] i just kick it out and let the sweet
[1:11:39] holy spirit
[1:11:40] of god like a dove move down in me i
[1:11:43] want to live eternally lord
[1:11:44] and i want you to help me at this time
[1:11:47] grant it
[1:11:47] now brother branham goes on to say
[1:11:51] in this portion here and he says he says
[1:11:54] now he says that love and he deals with
[1:11:56] what love is right after he's made that
[1:11:57] statement
[1:11:58] he said see love love love him
[1:12:01] see what he's done for you it's by love
[1:12:05] love brings obedience
[1:12:10] you can have the most severe case of
[1:12:12] rebellion on your hand i've had many
[1:12:14] times where
[1:12:15] you know and i don't want to get too
[1:12:16] much into that but as a person they
[1:12:18] could
[1:12:19] you know i've had different times
[1:12:20] they're standing counsel and i can say
[1:12:22] well this is the standard and this is
[1:12:23] where the standard will be in your home
[1:12:25] but if you're going to hold that you
[1:12:27] hold that standard and you should
[1:12:28] but you need to make sure that you've
[1:12:30] got a firm relationship
[1:12:32] because because commandments with that
[1:12:36] relationship
[1:12:37] becomes rules without love
[1:12:40] it becomes do's and don'ts whereas when
[1:12:43] love when the relationship
[1:12:46] is strong even in the things
[1:12:49] that that that a person with teenage one
[1:12:51] or more
[1:12:52] that may not want to do but if love is
[1:12:54] there love
[1:12:55] brings respect
[1:12:58] are you hearing me love brings respect
[1:13:01] love itself will conquer that
[1:13:04] amen hey you and me are living examples
[1:13:06] you say brother samuel i've already been
[1:13:08] born again but yet you still pack we
[1:13:10] still pack around
[1:13:11] that old sticky carnal nature there's
[1:13:13] sometimes when the word goes to dealing
[1:13:15] with our life and here we are i don't
[1:13:17] know
[1:13:18] and but yet what does god do god his
[1:13:20] love is so
[1:13:21] strong to our hearts and to our lives
[1:13:24] what does it do
[1:13:25] it causes us to relinquish even where we
[1:13:28] think
[1:13:28] i got a right to feel this way they
[1:13:30] shouldn't have done this to me
[1:13:32] or this shouldn't but love the love of
[1:13:34] god will cause you
[1:13:36] to relinquish even feelings
[1:13:43] so love brings obedience notice here in
[1:13:46] romans 6
[1:13:47] 16 paul is speaking here to the
[1:13:50] believers he says
[1:13:51] know ye not that to whom ye
[1:13:55] yield yourselves servants to obey
[1:13:58] his servants ye are to whom you obey
[1:14:02] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:14:05] obedience unto righteousness so
[1:14:07] he's dealing with a choice let me just
[1:14:09] let me just remind you
[1:14:11] every one of us have this choice
[1:14:14] when paul deals with in this chapter
[1:14:16] these scriptures
[1:14:17] it we're not only looking at it leading
[1:14:20] into the new birth
[1:14:21] but you're also looking at it these are
[1:14:23] instruments
[1:14:24] these instruments that are here just
[1:14:26] like you know this mask
[1:14:28] this mask itself is no more than just an
[1:14:30] instrument
[1:14:31] the microphone itself is no more than
[1:14:33] just a tool
[1:14:34] that tool has got to be picked up and
[1:14:37] it's put in the hand of one
[1:14:39] so here paul is dealing with that our
[1:14:41] lives
[1:14:42] are instruments and he says you you
[1:14:44] yield
[1:14:45] yourselves servants to obey
[1:14:49] hit that his servants ye are to whom you
[1:14:52] obey so you're yielding to somebody
[1:14:56] you're yielding to somebody you're not
[1:14:58] neutral you're yielding to someone
[1:15:01] to yield this word yield means to
[1:15:03] present oneself
[1:15:05] on the side of one
[1:15:08] it means to actually place yourself
[1:15:11] beside one and say i stand with this
[1:15:16] that's what yielding does it's that i i
[1:15:18] stand
[1:15:19] with this how in obedience
[1:15:22] so yielding and obedience goes hand in
[1:15:25] hand
[1:15:26] i know a lot of times we think oh my
[1:15:28] that's you know that's so elementary but
[1:15:30] remember
[1:15:31] obedience god prefers obedience
[1:15:34] better than any sacrifice obedience
[1:15:38] itself is a part as a condition that
[1:15:40] takes place
[1:15:41] inside the heart of an individual of
[1:15:44] submission that's what this word
[1:15:45] it actually refers to a submission now
[1:15:48] notice what paul
[1:15:49] would write of this and say but god be
[1:15:52] faint
[1:15:53] that ye were the servants of sin but you
[1:15:56] have
[1:15:56] obeyed from the heart that form of
[1:16:00] doctrine
[1:16:00] which was delivered to you now notice
[1:16:02] obeyed from the heart so
[1:16:04] we can hear the word hear the word hear
[1:16:06] the word but it won't do us any good if
[1:16:08] we're not receiving it
[1:16:10] we have to receive the word i think of
[1:16:12] it brother adam was just texted some
[1:16:13] brothers and we looked at this
[1:16:15] here was here was a statement that
[1:16:17] brother brown makes here in the message
[1:16:18] after the spirit of the lord
[1:16:20] calls a man out and says uh this and
[1:16:22] this and this is wrong with you
[1:16:23] uh mr so-and-so or don't receive it
[1:16:27] receive it while it's here and he says
[1:16:29] oh you're not going to receive it he
[1:16:30] said watch he'll prove he's the one
[1:16:32] that's here he goes right around
[1:16:34] and he calls out the spirit of the lord
[1:16:35] calls out another one he said see sir
[1:16:38] you missed it god vindicated your
[1:16:40] healing was right here i tell you
[1:16:42] friends
[1:16:43] we do not want to miss it
[1:16:46] we do not want to miss it you say i
[1:16:48] don't want to miss the rapture hey i
[1:16:49] don't want to miss a service
[1:16:50] i don't want to miss a moment i don't
[1:16:52] want to miss any moment
[1:16:53] of any day that i can be in his presence
[1:16:56] that is a life that says i don't want to
[1:16:58] miss it
[1:17:00] i don't want to miss it so to yield is
[1:17:03] to obey
[1:17:04] so there is a part and all how we need
[1:17:07] the help of almighty god
[1:17:09] and god would help us to be able to
[1:17:12] actually
[1:17:13] to be able to grasp the very things that
[1:17:15] what god is saying and it's not
[1:17:17] our natural mind to be able to do it but
[1:17:19] it is god who does it now
[1:17:21] let me look at this here just one more
[1:17:22] time but ye have obeyed
[1:17:24] from the heart that form of doctrine
[1:17:28] which was delivered to you
[1:17:29] this word even as we look at this this
[1:17:32] form of doctrine
[1:17:33] this is not a bank of teaching
[1:17:36] amen it was delivered to you
[1:17:40] this form of doctrine it deals with
[1:17:44] an example an in sample something that
[1:17:47] has been
[1:17:47] pressed upon when there's been a living
[1:17:50] image
[1:17:51] that's come before you a living reality
[1:17:54] because
[1:17:55] teaching alone won't change a man
[1:18:00] it takes the holy ghost to come
[1:18:03] and he comes through that word and the
[1:18:05] spirit of god
[1:18:06] he'll never override our will
[1:18:11] he won't do it it has to be our yield
[1:18:14] our will that's yielded to him
[1:18:16] notice this paul here's what here's the
[1:18:18] commission think of paul
[1:18:20] he could tell them you have been obeyed
[1:18:22] from the heart that form of doctrine
[1:18:24] which was delivered to you
[1:18:26] now to think of this in acts 26
[1:18:29] 18 this was the testimony of where paul
[1:18:33] had received the visitation and his
[1:18:36] commissioning
[1:18:37] from god himself
[1:18:40] this is what this word is to do to open
[1:18:43] their eyes it's more than just these
[1:18:48] eyes
[1:18:48] but it opens the eyes of our heart
[1:18:53] and to turn from darkness
[1:18:56] to light and from the power of satan
[1:19:00] unto god that they may receive
[1:19:03] forgiveness of sins
[1:19:05] and inheritance among them which are
[1:19:08] sanctified
[1:19:09] by faith that is in me
[1:19:13] when you trace through the scriptures
[1:19:16] you find paul as he would and just to
[1:19:19] hone in on paul
[1:19:21] paul would declare that when he came
[1:19:23] among
[1:19:24] the children of god he said this desire
[1:19:28] was to know
[1:19:28] nothing among you save jesus christ
[1:19:32] and him crucified
[1:19:36] paul would declare that why he says that
[1:19:39] your faith might stand in the power of
[1:19:42] god
[1:19:43] not in the enticing words of man's
[1:19:45] wisdom so this form of doctrine
[1:19:47] that is believed that was believed and
[1:19:50] obeyed from
[1:19:51] from the heart it was more than just
[1:19:53] teaching
[1:19:54] that turned around because teaching can
[1:19:56] cause a man
[1:19:57] a man can grasp that up here a man
[1:20:00] listen if you hear something long enough
[1:20:01] you can memorize it
[1:20:03] you can and everything else but you see
[1:20:05] god his desire
[1:20:07] is from the heart that's how we really
[1:20:09] know god let me just say it like this
[1:20:11] when you when you know god in that way
[1:20:14] don't worry about his book this is what
[1:20:16] brother rand told us he said don't you
[1:20:18] worry about his book the bible
[1:20:19] he said you get the love of god in your
[1:20:21] heart and then he said you'll be able
[1:20:24] to read the word of god and god will
[1:20:26] speak to your heart
[1:20:27] or you may not have everything tied
[1:20:29] together but it's a love letter
[1:20:31] there are things that are precious to
[1:20:33] you that you know
[1:20:34] that where the word itself was a letter
[1:20:37] but now
[1:20:38] it's a love letter to you what's
[1:20:41] happened
[1:20:41] something's changed amen this message
[1:20:45] itself
[1:20:45] is not just something that mom and daddy
[1:20:47] believe but now it becomes something to
[1:20:50] you
[1:20:50] it's given me life it's made jesus
[1:20:53] christ
[1:20:53] real to my life it's given me
[1:20:57] power it's given me strength
[1:21:02] this is why paul when he would deal with
[1:21:04] crucify
[1:21:05] he was not just pointing them back this
[1:21:07] was not just pointing back to calvary
[1:21:10] but here it was remember he could also
[1:21:12] say
[1:21:13] that jesus christ he said that of the
[1:21:16] seed
[1:21:16] the son of david he was raised from the
[1:21:19] grave
[1:21:19] according to my gospel so there had to
[1:21:22] be a crucifying
[1:21:23] why because the debt had to be paid
[1:21:27] let me tell you whether you recognize it
[1:21:28] this morning or not every one of your
[1:21:31] sins have already been paid for
[1:21:35] they've already been paid for
[1:21:38] he made the ultimate decision as a
[1:21:41] sacrifice
[1:21:42] for past present and future sin behold
[1:21:45] the lamb that
[1:21:46] taketh away the sin of the world
[1:21:50] he offered up his life willingly
[1:21:55] a man here then through the crucifixion
[1:21:58] and now through the resurrection what
[1:22:00] does he do
[1:22:01] he comes back to make known to his
[1:22:03] disciples
[1:22:04] that i am he that was dead and i'm alive
[1:22:07] forevermore
[1:22:08] he lets him know the debt has been paid
[1:22:11] he lets him know the promise
[1:22:12] is sure to you that these promises they
[1:22:15] are
[1:22:16] your promises
[1:22:21] hallelujah so when we look at this here
[1:22:25] paul in galatians 3 paul said all
[1:22:28] foolish galatians
[1:22:30] who hath bewitched you that you should
[1:22:32] not obey the truth
[1:22:35] now remember what happened to the
[1:22:36] galatians
[1:22:39] they they were walking by the spirit
[1:22:42] but then you had some fellas come in
[1:22:45] that that wanted to move them back to a
[1:22:47] place of works
[1:22:52] and paul said as he's dealing with this
[1:22:55] he'd said many things concerning him he
[1:22:57] said i'm afraid of your experience
[1:23:00] because christ is the fulfillment of the
[1:23:04] law
[1:23:06] hallelujah notice he says before whose
[1:23:09] eyes
[1:23:10] jesus christ hath been evidently
[1:23:13] set forth crucified among
[1:23:16] you so paul was standing there and he
[1:23:20] he made known to them who was the one
[1:23:23] that's been here right before you
[1:23:26] who's the one that's been here the whole
[1:23:28] time
[1:23:29] he's the one that was set before your
[1:23:31] eyes
[1:23:33] this was not just words it was the
[1:23:35] person
[1:23:36] of jesus christ coming present coming
[1:23:39] before them
[1:23:40] he's the one as he said that worked
[1:23:43] miracles among you
[1:23:44] he's the one that dealt with your heart
[1:23:47] paul is
[1:23:48] letting it be known he's the one who was
[1:23:50] sat before you
[1:23:51] as and that word evidently would be like
[1:23:54] of a
[1:23:55] of a canvas where a painting was on and
[1:23:58] paul was letting it be known hey
[1:24:00] i'm nothing but a blank canvas but jesus
[1:24:03] christ
[1:24:03] has revealed this revelation he put in
[1:24:06] my heart
[1:24:06] this image is being expressed not a not
[1:24:09] an
[1:24:10] image of a church but it's the image of
[1:24:12] the living god
[1:24:13] of his word that's being set before you
[1:24:17] that has an effect
[1:24:21] notice the scripture says in titus
[1:24:24] chapter 2
[1:24:26] for the grace of god now dealing with
[1:24:28] this love
[1:24:30] you see sometimes love itself
[1:24:35] some of it is just the way it's looked
[1:24:38] at is that love is so
[1:24:39] mushy love doesn't have any backbone on
[1:24:42] it
[1:24:44] brother said if your wife would got out
[1:24:46] there and running around with any other
[1:24:49] any other man and you just said well i
[1:24:50] ain't going to say nothing to her you
[1:24:51] know i love her so much he said your
[1:24:53] love is not
[1:24:56] right
[1:24:59] jesus christ his love is right
[1:25:02] it's correct i can't speak for all these
[1:25:06] false prophets and false teachers
[1:25:09] when they want to paint god's love is it
[1:25:11] just oh god's love just overlooks your
[1:25:13] sin
[1:25:14] all you got to do is love god but you've
[1:25:16] got to love him
[1:25:17] get the same love that he loved you
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:22] it begins with your love him tapping
[1:25:26] your heart but it must come to where
[1:25:29] your life
[1:25:30] and life is lived according to the same
[1:25:33] love
[1:25:34] that the father loved him you say that's
[1:25:36] impossible
[1:25:37] i agree i agree i agree i agree
[1:25:41] with man but with god all things
[1:25:44] are possible that's why there must come
[1:25:48] a higher love that which is the true
[1:25:50] love
[1:25:51] agape love that will actually bring
[1:25:54] deliverance
[1:25:58] this is where paul would express this
[1:26:00] here for the grace of god
[1:26:02] that bringeth salvation i want you to
[1:26:04] watch this now
[1:26:05] for the grace of god that bringeth
[1:26:08] salvation hath appeared to all men
[1:26:14] it came present the grace of god
[1:26:17] it had made itself known
[1:26:21] teaching us that denying
[1:26:24] ungodliness and worldly lust we should
[1:26:28] live
[1:26:28] soberly righteously and godly
[1:26:32] in this present world aren't you glad
[1:26:36] this teaching us it deals with
[1:26:38] chastening us
[1:26:40] but chastening isn't always about the
[1:26:42] belt
[1:26:43] the rod no no no no it's god
[1:26:47] instructing you and i instructing us in
[1:26:50] righteousness
[1:26:51] there's things that you think what about
[1:26:52] what did brother graham say he said look
[1:26:54] he's speaking to the pentecostal women
[1:26:56] he said here you are he said something
[1:26:58] with short hair
[1:26:59] he said but he said but what about he
[1:27:01] said you accused jacqueline kennedy he
[1:27:03] said
[1:27:03] what if she'd heard what you've heard
[1:27:06] maybe she wouldn't do what she's doing
[1:27:09] are you with me but you see god's mercy
[1:27:12] listen friends
[1:27:13] it goes much deeper even than that just
[1:27:15] a clothing
[1:27:16] but god deals with every part let me
[1:27:18] tell you something this
[1:27:20] teaching is not a series of services
[1:27:23] this teaching is the literal person
[1:27:27] of jesus christ coming present
[1:27:31] brother branham didn't hold a bank of
[1:27:32] teaching services in africa
[1:27:34] when those women were sitting there and
[1:27:36] they were all they were naked
[1:27:39] are you with me but when the angel of
[1:27:41] the lord came present
[1:27:43] they covered their chest and they bathed
[1:27:46] out
[1:27:46] of the meeting who did that the angel of
[1:27:50] the lord
[1:27:50] the grace of god appeared
[1:27:55] amen hallelujah bring us salvation
[1:28:00] deliverance to rescue
[1:28:04] and he still teaches us
[1:28:10] the holy ghost is a teacher on the
[1:28:13] inside he'll lead and guide you into all
[1:28:15] truth
[1:28:15] it's not just talking about mysteries
[1:28:18] and the unfolding of the word
[1:28:19] but he'll lead you in all truth in your
[1:28:21] attitudes your actions and everything
[1:28:23] else
[1:28:23] to where it's truth because truth is not
[1:28:25] a doctrine truth
[1:28:27] is the person of jesus christ you shall
[1:28:30] know
[1:28:30] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:28:34] create you free
[1:28:35] [Applause]
[1:28:38] hallelujah it's truth when you've been
[1:28:41] born again of the spirit of god
[1:28:43] now the life you live is a life of truth
[1:28:48] that's really who you always were
[1:28:52] there was a lot of darkness that covered
[1:28:54] your life but
[1:28:55] truth came the word was speaking to your
[1:29:00] life
[1:29:01] and what does it do as the darkness
[1:29:03] itself is giving way
[1:29:05] oh my what takes place truth itself
[1:29:08] comes into manifestation
[1:29:13] glory be to god teaching us
[1:29:20] i want you to think of this paul goes on
[1:29:23] to say
[1:29:23] looking for that blessed hope and the
[1:29:25] glorious appearing
[1:29:27] of the great god and our savior jesus
[1:29:29] christ who gave
[1:29:31] himself for us
[1:29:35] that he might redeem us from all
[1:29:38] iniquity so this is a real view of
[1:29:40] calvary
[1:29:41] redeem us not just not just forgive us
[1:29:46] but redeem us so not only forgiven
[1:29:51] but to where the nature has been changed
[1:29:54] on the inside
[1:29:55] to where god looks at you as a son and
[1:29:57] daughter of god and says
[1:29:58] you never did it in the first place
[1:30:05] why because there's a new man
[1:30:09] on the inside
[1:30:13] that he might redeem us from all
[1:30:15] lawlessness iniquity
[1:30:17] and purify unto unto himself a peculiar
[1:30:21] people
[1:30:22] zealous of good works that don't stop
[1:30:25] can you say amen
[1:30:26] it's a people that we have been redeemed
[1:30:29] purified
[1:30:30] zealous of good works zealous of what
[1:30:33] good works
[1:30:34] the good works we were foreign to as the
[1:30:37] word itself
[1:30:38] is being made known how that there's a
[1:30:40] desire there's a passion
[1:30:42] in our heart to please god there's a
[1:30:44] love there's a desire
[1:30:46] in our hearts to please god
[1:30:50] anybody ever felt so tired that you
[1:30:52] didn't feel like praying
[1:30:54] go ahead it's all right sure you felt
[1:30:57] tired you didn't feel like praying
[1:30:58] i felt so tired that man i you know here
[1:31:00] you are and you know i don't have
[1:31:01] nothing else laying before me today
[1:31:03] maybe you're you're just you're tired
[1:31:04] you just don't feel like you don't even
[1:31:05] feel like
[1:31:06] reading you know you maybe feel like
[1:31:07] listening to a message
[1:31:10] are you with me now but down here is
[1:31:13] something there on the inside now we
[1:31:15] can't always say that it goes this way
[1:31:17] but we can say what a victory it is when
[1:31:18] we can say lord
[1:31:20] i'm going to anyhow i'm going to
[1:31:23] override
[1:31:24] the feelings of this man
[1:31:28] and i'm going to borrow his knees so
[1:31:31] that i can pray
[1:31:34] lord i don't have right now i'm sweet
[1:31:36] i'm weak in my body
[1:31:38] i'm tired but i want to tell you
[1:31:41] i love you i appreciate you lord
[1:31:45] i'm thankful lord god for the work that
[1:31:47] you've done lord in my life
[1:31:49] i'm thankful god for your word that you
[1:31:51] sent us you know what you go to doing
[1:31:53] that just a little bit
[1:31:54] you'll find how many knows that you find
[1:31:57] that the tiredness
[1:31:58] just starts fleeing away why you've made
[1:32:00] a
[1:32:01] sacrifice to enter into his presence
[1:32:05] what made that sacrifice there's a love
[1:32:08] that you gave into you gave into it
[1:32:11] nobody drove you to it
[1:32:13] you gave into it because you know if i
[1:32:16] can just press
[1:32:17] beyond this feeling if i can just press
[1:32:20] beyond this
[1:32:30] he rebukes notice let me read this
[1:32:31] scripture
[1:32:34] as many as i love i rebuke
[1:32:37] and chase him be zealous therefore
[1:32:41] and repent now when brother brahm takes
[1:32:45] this scripture he says
[1:32:46] there's many true he's then dealing with
[1:32:49] it at the end of the age he said there's
[1:32:50] many
[1:32:51] that are true christians that need to
[1:32:53] repent
[1:32:55] now don't get quiet on me because
[1:32:57] there's things when listen to me now
[1:32:59] when the word has come in this hour
[1:33:04] god brought a restoration
[1:33:07] of what was lost
[1:33:11] i wish i had half i wish i had half of a
[1:33:13] bottle god did not give us in this age
[1:33:17] a quarter of a bottle he down to give us
[1:33:19] a half of a bottle
[1:33:20] or three quarters but this bottle right
[1:33:23] now you could look at it and say this
[1:33:25] bottle is sealed
[1:33:28] what's that mean you would say here's a
[1:33:30] full bottle
[1:33:31] of water the water being a rep being a
[1:33:34] type of the holy ghost
[1:33:36] god did not pour out just that of
[1:33:38] justification
[1:33:40] just just sanctification just the
[1:33:42] restoration of the
[1:33:43] of the gifts and the outpouring of the
[1:33:44] holy spirit but god has poured
[1:33:47] his entire self into the church
[1:33:50] of the living god are you with me it's
[1:33:54] not just a part of it
[1:33:55] it's the very fullness of god himself
[1:33:58] it's
[1:33:58] christ himself now living
[1:34:01] in his bride body
[1:34:04] so with that life as he would chase him
[1:34:08] he would rebuke he reproves us and this
[1:34:12] is done with a vision in mind i want you
[1:34:15] to understand
[1:34:16] this is not our final home
[1:34:20] we're promised to him that overcometh
[1:34:23] will set with me
[1:34:24] in my throne even as i have overcome and
[1:34:27] sat down with my father
[1:34:28] in his throne we're promised that
[1:34:32] overcoming
[1:34:32] so there's a word that works and deals
[1:34:35] with our life
[1:34:36] it corrects us he instructs us he leads
[1:34:39] us
[1:34:40] it's him doing it amen
[1:34:43] is that right that's his love because so
[1:34:45] you see
[1:34:46] love itself i'm trying to get somewhere
[1:34:48] here love itself
[1:34:49] it's a discipline love itself of how god
[1:34:52] works with our lives let me come in let
[1:34:56] me come here to this scripture here
[1:34:59] let me come back to this in romans 6 17
[1:35:02] but god be thanked
[1:35:06] that ye were past
[1:35:10] the servants of sin enslaved to it
[1:35:16] yes but ye have obeyed
[1:35:19] from the heart that form of doctrine
[1:35:23] which was delivered to you
[1:35:28] remember the scripture
[1:35:31] the bible says let us be glad and
[1:35:33] rejoice
[1:35:34] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:35:39] and his wife have made herself ready
[1:35:43] brother brown makes a statement in the
[1:35:44] message marriage of the lamb
[1:35:46] it's very fitting he said many people
[1:35:49] say
[1:35:50] if god only took this drinking spirit
[1:35:52] away from me this smoking spirit this
[1:35:54] immoral spirit
[1:35:55] this and that he said but you've got
[1:35:58] something to do
[1:35:59] the bible says blessed is he that
[1:36:02] overcometh
[1:36:03] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:36:06] things
[1:36:07] now once you listen what he says he says
[1:36:09] you've got the power
[1:36:11] to do it are you risking me now you got
[1:36:14] the power to do it
[1:36:15] don't believe what the devil is trying
[1:36:18] to tell you
[1:36:21] resetting sin don't believe it believe
[1:36:25] what the word is saying
[1:36:26] you have power to do it what's the power
[1:36:28] to do it he says you must be
[1:36:30] willing to do it that's the power right
[1:36:33] there
[1:36:34] is willingness according to the word
[1:36:37] to say in your heart lord be it unto me
[1:36:40] according to thy word it's letting is
[1:36:43] agreeing with that word
[1:36:44] that's the power the power is there
[1:36:47] if you're willing that's the power
[1:36:50] willing to lay it down
[1:36:59] are you with me
[1:37:05] i i know a little bit i've prayed with
[1:37:06] people many different times
[1:37:10] and the things still continue on
[1:37:14] you say brother samuel what is that well
[1:37:16] listen
[1:37:17] this is not algebra it's willingness
[1:37:21] to let it down willingness to lay it
[1:37:25] down that's the power that's given to
[1:37:28] you
[1:37:29] the word the word comes it speaks to our
[1:37:32] hearts
[1:37:33] to bring us to that place to say yes
[1:37:36] lord
[1:37:37] and it's that simple it's there don't
[1:37:39] let the devil say oh you got to go to
[1:37:40] somebody you got to go to somebody else
[1:37:42] and you got to go to somebody else
[1:37:43] you could have a hundred preachers lay
[1:37:45] hands on you it's not the preacher that
[1:37:47] takes it away from you
[1:37:49] are you with me it ain't the preacher
[1:37:52] that takes it away from you
[1:37:53] it's that willingness in your heart you
[1:37:55] might say what if a person
[1:37:57] is possessed of a devil if they're
[1:37:59] willing come on now i'm going to the
[1:38:01] bible legion himself
[1:38:03] he had a whole mess of demons on him but
[1:38:06] he heard
[1:38:07] jesus was coming to town there wasn't
[1:38:10] enough
[1:38:10] devils that could hold him back why he
[1:38:13] had the power
[1:38:14] of willingness to say i'm willing i can
[1:38:17] be free
[1:38:18] if i can just get to jesus
[1:38:25] she have made herself ready
[1:38:28] that's the fear of god obedience to his
[1:38:31] word
[1:38:32] amen hallelujah
[1:38:35] that's given to you and i
[1:38:39] being then made free
[1:38:43] from sin he became
[1:38:47] the servants the slaves bond slave
[1:38:51] love slave of righteousness
[1:38:57] you're not bound by fear
[1:39:00] you could do whatever you want to do
[1:39:04] see perfect love it's not held i have to
[1:39:07] do this
[1:39:08] i must do this if i don't do this that's
[1:39:11] not perfect love
[1:39:12] but perfect love says i do it because i
[1:39:15] love him
[1:39:18] you're not obeying his word out of fear
[1:39:20] you're obeying it because
[1:39:22] you love him
[1:39:27] let me try to find here a place to close
[1:39:31] the bible says in second corinthians 7
[1:39:33] after these promises have been made
[1:39:34] known
[1:39:34] having therefore these promises dearly
[1:39:36] beloved what was the promises
[1:39:38] god's desire was to walk inside
[1:39:42] of his people live in them walk in them
[1:39:47] he said having therefore these promises
[1:39:49] dearly beloved let us cleanse
[1:39:51] ourself from all filthiness of the flesh
[1:39:54] and spirit perfecting holiness in the
[1:39:57] fear of god
[1:39:58] you know i love paul was not afraid to
[1:40:00] take the hand of the believer and put it
[1:40:02] in the hand of god and say
[1:40:03] go to it notice
[1:40:06] let us brethren let us
[1:40:10] perfecting holiness bringing it to its
[1:40:13] perfection
[1:40:13] to a completion and may i say this to
[1:40:16] you it doesn't
[1:40:17] stop it doesn't stop
[1:40:21] it keeps going
[1:40:24] who wouldn't listen when you think of
[1:40:26] this the bible says grieve not the
[1:40:28] spirit of god whereby you're sealed
[1:40:30] until the day of redemption is that
[1:40:31] right
[1:40:32] so to think of it to hold brother bram
[1:40:35] says if you got a feeling in your heart
[1:40:36] i got a right to get even he said as
[1:40:38] soon as you've got that feeling in your
[1:40:40] heart the holy ghost takes its flight
[1:40:44] so even our thoughts but to think
[1:40:47] sometimes
[1:40:48] how many times that we've held on to
[1:40:50] thoughts
[1:40:51] or feelings instead of holding on to him
[1:40:56] see it's valuing his presence
[1:40:59] there can be certain tendencies in your
[1:41:01] life maybe because of strains down
[1:41:02] through the family but there's something
[1:41:04] in your heart that realizes
[1:41:06] i am not going to make excuses i
[1:41:09] am going to take god's word cleansing
[1:41:12] myself
[1:41:12] cleansing yourself yes because you have
[1:41:15] access
[1:41:16] to his life
[1:41:20] first peter 1 22 seeing you have
[1:41:22] purified
[1:41:24] your souls in obeying
[1:41:27] the truth through the spirit
[1:41:31] unto unfaint love of the brethren see
[1:41:34] that you love one another with a pure
[1:41:36] heart
[1:41:37] fervently notice purified your souls
[1:41:43] how by taking of the word of god
[1:41:49] by receiving of that word saying yes
[1:41:52] lord
[1:41:53] i believe it don't try to reason with it
[1:41:55] it won't do you no good soon as you try
[1:41:56] to reason with it
[1:41:57] you hybridize it it it kills the effect
[1:42:01] of it
[1:42:01] right there what should i do just say
[1:42:05] amen say lord give me a heart that just
[1:42:09] so completely in line with the word lord
[1:42:12] a life that says yes lord seeing you
[1:42:14] have purified your souls and obeying the
[1:42:16] truth through the spirit unto unfaint
[1:42:18] love of the brethren
[1:42:19] see that you love one another with a
[1:42:21] pure heart fervently
[1:42:22] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:42:26] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:42:29] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:42:34] listen to this and i'll close
[1:42:37] he said now we know drinking and
[1:42:41] carrying on
[1:42:42] is sin but the whole thing is because
[1:42:46] of unbelief all the rest of
[1:42:49] it's just attributes of one thing
[1:42:52] unbelievable
[1:42:53] because if you believe god and jesus
[1:42:55] christ to be his son
[1:42:57] you are absolutely not going to do those
[1:43:00] things
[1:43:01] he that's born of god does not commit
[1:43:03] commit means
[1:43:04] practice from nature practice
[1:43:08] sin you must believe
[1:43:12] the whole thing lays in faith jesus said
[1:43:16] he that heareth my words
[1:43:18] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:43:21] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:43:23] condemnation but
[1:43:24] already passed from death unto life
[1:43:28] he says there is nothing else that you
[1:43:30] can do
[1:43:31] only believe
[1:43:35] you know it's given to you to believe
[1:43:38] it's given to you paul said in the book
[1:43:40] of philippians it's
[1:43:42] given to you to believe if
[1:43:45] you believe notice this this is profound
[1:43:47] if you believe
[1:43:49] then them little immoral things will
[1:43:52] just drop off like that as you believe
[1:43:56] you become love
[1:44:01] as you what believe you become
[1:44:04] love whose love his love his love that's
[1:44:08] bringing
[1:44:09] salvation deliverance it rescues you
[1:44:13] from the slavery of sin glory be to god
[1:44:17] it brings a rescue in our life from fear
[1:44:20] it brings deliverance it gives strength
[1:44:23] to you and i
[1:44:24] as you believe you become love and love
[1:44:27] is god
[1:44:28] and you begin to wind yourself into
[1:44:31] christ oh i love that
[1:44:33] it's so simple in it and you begin to
[1:44:36] wind yourself
[1:44:36] into christ and these other things
[1:44:40] you don't have to quit doing them they
[1:44:43] just quit themselves
[1:44:47] there's just no desire to do it
[1:44:52] so perfect love it casts out fear
[1:44:55] perfect love it drives up because what
[1:44:57] is fear lack of confidence
[1:44:59] unbelief it drives it out from that life
[1:45:03] and as the life just begins to wind
[1:45:05] themselves on into christ
[1:45:08] letting their heart just just taking in
[1:45:11] of that word
[1:45:12] they're winding themselves in him in a
[1:45:15] love affair
[1:45:16] and then it isn't something that we're
[1:45:18] quitting let me tell you something right
[1:45:19] now
[1:45:19] if there's any one of you in here could
[1:45:21] say you quit something then you still
[1:45:23] got a problem
[1:45:25] because there's not one of us that quit
[1:45:27] anything i didn't quit the things that
[1:45:29] was in my life
[1:45:30] you didn't quit them you mean you just
[1:45:32] kept on doing them no
[1:45:34] his love was so projected
[1:45:38] i found something that was so much
[1:45:42] greater
[1:45:44] like brother jewel said he said i just
[1:45:45] stopped dancing i just changed partners
[1:45:50] just got a hold of the real wine the new
[1:45:51] wine and it brought a real intoxication
[1:45:54] a real change of life
[1:45:56] are you with me it it it change it
[1:45:59] brings a change in but you see what you
[1:46:02] say
[1:46:02] what about the quitting it's the
[1:46:03] willingness to lay it down
[1:46:05] that willingness does not come from you
[1:46:08] your strength
[1:46:09] it comes from his word he gives you the
[1:46:12] power
[1:46:14] to lay it down you say lord
[1:46:18] i lay it down
[1:46:23] the ramp said see says that worshiper
[1:46:25] wants purge
[1:46:26] there's no more conscience or desire of
[1:46:28] sin
[1:46:30] when the worshipers purge when he is
[1:46:31] born again look at this
[1:46:33] when his old nature dies
[1:46:37] and a new nature sets in then he becomes
[1:46:41] a part of god
[1:46:42] a son of god he gets new
[1:46:45] life by what
[1:46:49] the love of god
[1:46:52] it's just think of how love
[1:46:55] itself how it works we see
[1:46:59] god has to come he brings correction
[1:47:00] into our life
[1:47:02] he guides us he directs us
[1:47:06] just his presence coming will bring
[1:47:09] conviction
[1:47:12] let me tell you something this would
[1:47:14] help you to help you
[1:47:17] if you recognize that lord let my life
[1:47:19] be so affected by your presence
[1:47:22] it'll bring conviction you won't say
[1:47:24] things that you ain't supposed to say
[1:47:27] you won't run people down you won't post
[1:47:30] things you're not supposed to post
[1:47:31] are you with me is it not about a church
[1:47:34] thing it's about the love of god
[1:47:37] it's about him that's why i'm coming to
[1:47:39] the house of god
[1:47:40] we don't just come here and just we
[1:47:43] don't want to leave out the same way
[1:47:46] right what's the purpose in coming if we
[1:47:48] leave out of here the same way
[1:47:51] so don't let the devil just say well
[1:47:53] yeah there ain't nothing happened to you
[1:47:54] but he look just be simple say god if
[1:47:57] you're here in that condition this
[1:47:58] morning say lord
[1:47:59] let my heart be open to you lord
[1:48:02] i want my heart to be open lord i want
[1:48:05] you to deal with my heart i want you to
[1:48:07] speak to my life lord jesus
[1:48:10] be honest with god say lord i want to be
[1:48:12] an absorption
[1:48:14] to this word i want to be changed in my
[1:48:17] life lord god
[1:48:20] every one of us every one of us desire
[1:48:23] more of god every one of us desire more
[1:48:27] of god
[1:48:29] you take for example it's just like like
[1:48:31] in this i'm closing
[1:48:32] you take for example hear a man and a
[1:48:35] woman
[1:48:38] they start to notice one another and
[1:48:40] this is filial
[1:48:42] they start to notice one another then
[1:48:44] they start
[1:48:45] talking
[1:48:49] brown tells us in the token he says love
[1:48:51] brings obedience
[1:48:53] love brings courtship love brings
[1:48:55] marriage
[1:48:59] so they start talking courtship
[1:49:02] is a time of wooing don't know
[1:49:05] is this the one i don't know but see all
[1:49:09] through the time of courtship
[1:49:11] is a time of repentance
[1:49:14] it's a time where of of obedience
[1:49:18] to the word and then it comes to that
[1:49:21] place
[1:49:22] of an of where their hearts in that
[1:49:26] engagement
[1:49:27] to where their hearts have become one
[1:49:31] their their hearts are beating together
[1:49:34] although they're
[1:49:35] miles apart maybe or houses apart or
[1:49:37] whatever
[1:49:38] you see what's happening is a
[1:49:40] transformation that's taking place
[1:49:43] think how god's been dealing with our
[1:49:45] hearts now for months
[1:49:48] that old nature doesn't die just just
[1:49:51] where it's just where there's no
[1:49:53] agreement there's got to be agreements
[1:49:55] and it comes to that place where it
[1:49:57] lines up with god's word
[1:49:59] and then god takes care of it and brings
[1:50:01] forth that new man by the new birth
[1:50:04] then that's a marriage
[1:50:08] what began as a courtship went into
[1:50:12] that of an engagement a betrothal
[1:50:14] however you want to word it
[1:50:16] but it leads to a marriage that takes
[1:50:18] place
[1:50:20] and that marriage is where these two
[1:50:22] shall no longer be
[1:50:24] 20 two separate people they shall be
[1:50:28] one and whoever is joined unto the lord
[1:50:32] is one spirit is one
[1:50:37] this is how god moves within our lives
[1:50:39] i'm so thankful for that aren't you
[1:50:42] i tell you friends take the word that
[1:50:45] even how god has spoken this here
[1:50:47] today a lot of instruction within this
[1:50:49] but
[1:50:51] it's obedience from the heart
[1:50:54] as he's speaking to us obey his
[1:50:58] voice you want to get anywhere with god
[1:51:01] obey his voice yield to him
[1:51:06] he's the one he's the one that we want
[1:51:09] to hear he's the one we want to give
