with each of you amen here this evening and we certainly want to say we thank the lord we have uh brother devlin here he's going to be he's going to come walk into the waters of baptism tonight's brother doug's grandson so we're going to baptize him in the name of the lord jesus christ and just a few weeks back when he had given his heart to the lord and with a real with a desire to serve the lord and those were things that we spoke about even on sunday and um just of how that god takes a life and begins to work with that life and the one thing that i expressed to him and be it behooves to to every life as uh once you see if a person goes to build a deck or something like that there's some work that starts showing up at first but then there's there's got to be boards that are put up and things are put on the house and people keep walking by oh you've got to my you've got wood laying out and then they start looking for posts oh you've got the post in the ground but you know how it is if somebody keeps walking by week after week and hey you only got post in the ground you got to keep going you got to keep going you got to keep going the objective within everything of when god deals with a heart and a life is to be united with him amen it's him he's the one amen the one that deals with our life and becomes the very love of our life amen that's nothing but the truth isn't it amen aren't you glad that is as the scripture said and unless the lord build the house they that labor labor in vain amen we're just we just are so thankful to the lord amen so thankful for his mercy and let's just go to the lord in a word of prayer and let's just look to him tonight in a special way and just invite him heavenly father lord jesus we just so appreciate you lord we love you so many times lord it just seems lord we just don't even have the words to be able to express of what you really are and who you are to us lord oh god you're the love of our life you're everything to us lord and lord jesus we just lord desire tonight as we come into this place lord the fellowship around the word of god lord an atmosphere has been created lord with the desire to lay aside lord just for a few moments the weariness and the tiredness and the cares of this life because lord we know that our bodies and our spirit lord could be very weary lord from the day we ask that you would help us lord give us a charge right now that lord that that inner man o god could really lord be able to receive because we know it's the inner man that takes that word lord as the word is coming in the lamb is being delivered it's the fire on the inside that roast that lamb oh god and lord would see to it lord that the word itself lord has just moved forth in our life oh god for it's lord not by bread alone but by every word that lord proceeds out of the mouth of god that we live lord and our life is directed lord in you we pray now lord i ask that you'll just come and take these lips of clay oh god may you guide and direct here tonight lord with your holy spirit lord say what lord you would have to be said oh god and just move in our hearts in a special way may the spirit of god just move to every heart and every life that's gathered here lord tonight we just love you and we thank you now father in jesus precious name amen and amen amen i'm going to go straight to first corinthians 13 4 and then i'm just going to move on from there and where we've what we've been looking at here or at least were have been dealing with we've really been looking at the thought of honor and um honor is respect and that is something that god god values that of honor and of respect and it's things that when we look here in the scripture the honor that is among the children of god is his presence it's not it's not a self-made honor it's not a self-made title that's when remember when the lord jesus came and he was among the pharisees and they were they were seeking honor one of another they wanted certain seats and certain things and they did certain things they acted a certain way to to draw attention to themselves and so it wasn't a real humility it was a real false humility it wasn't a true honor and the lord jesus said it like this and it applies to every aspect in life he says how can you have faith when you seek honor one from another so the honor that that we receive as the children of god is where that it's god's presence that we can see and we can sense and it's honoring his presence uh even when there's things that we don't understand but we honor the presence of almighty god and this is what this that's what even when david was writing that into psalms where we started looking at that in psalms 105 where he led them along and he said touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm it's that of god god will always respect that and even as we we've seen it here in the scripture i'm not mean to keep you standing but you can even see how that god would lay in through paul as we were looking at here of even in aspects of life that goes right outside of beyond interactions with brothers and sisters when it gets right out there into the rest of the community and life and everything else and paul would take diligence by the spirit of god to write that to the children of god to see that servants obey your masters and he went through all of those parts of how that our lives should be in humility and giving honor that's respects and it invites the presence of god and paul would say just to remember he says it is unto of the inheritance that we receive from god and so um i want to just read here and then i'm going to let you be seated in first corinthians 13 4 paul writes charity suffereth long and is kind it endeth not and it vaunteth not itself up and is not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly and that's why i want to draw from that that word we is dealing with rudely or act unbecomingly it charity does not display itself in that way so may god bless his word and bless the reading of the words you're being seated as we're looking at this with honor and i just want to after some time and we started into it last week and honor in the home and just to see how that within all of these parts here that you know as we look at it brother branham would would take the time and i believe it wasn't uh and i'm not going to just give it to where it was brother branham's doing it was a holy spirit just so much to where that even that he would speak and express things because it's tied so perfectly within the scripture and the relationship between husband and wife and that of christ and the church and paul would write of that even in ephesians 5 and how brother branham would deal with how that love itself and i read this quote to you last week of how that love itself should be what governs the home and that's what should actually be the the the the banner or the standard over the home is that of of love and so when we look at this here just to move right into this and we know we understand that in everything that where paul is writing this by the spirit of god it does not behave itself unseemly so then the contrast of that is honor and i want to just i want to just begin here in a fee in a hebrews 13 4 and paul writes it in this way marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge i want you to think of this this this this is is a very uh powerful statement it was a powerful statement then and it's a powerful statement now marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled because when we look at this of of honorable the very word honorable here it means it's precious it's most precious more precious it's dear it's as of a great price it's held in honor it's esteemed and especially dear and brother branham would write it like would say it like this in god's covenant with abraham and he says i do not believe that satan is a creator i believe that satan is a perverter but not a creator because god is the only one who can create and in the beginning when he became co-partnered to god the son of the morning and so forth when he walked up and down a fiery brimstone and so forth that when satan perverted good to evil you know you know pervert is to do is to pervert anything and he said married life is of god married life is of god the bible said that married life is of god the bed is undefiled but prostitution and illegal that's perverted and look at the whole mind of american people and the peoples of the world is gradually becoming so perverted even the radio television it's all one big conglomeration of sin because the hearts of man call for that every intention of man's heart just like it was before the andaluvian destruction every desire of man is becoming continually evil and you know so when we we see this marriage is honor married life is of god it's not it's not that of that of of the enemy but the enemy has perverted it the enemy has taken something that should be held so precious most precious should be of high value and when satan gets a hold of something he takes it down from the value from what it really should be but it's wonderful and it's awesome that god himself it doesn't do away with the reality that marriage is honorable it's the real image of it that with though even the world itself is got away from all of that and then even to where the the state and the condition that it is in this hour yet we know that he would come to this in this hour paul would prophesy this by the spirit of god in the last days of how peerless times would come he would speak how men would be truth breakers nobody's a person of their word anymore they're without natural affection he would write of that even in the book of romans the first chapter in and having things that should be absolutely when he says without natural affection and it's gone without that that that part which should be something that should be so natural that would be that which is learned between how that a husband treats the wife and the wife responds back to the husband because the bible tells us in the book of thessalonians that you don't need any man to teach you of how that you are to love the brethren because he says you are every man taught of god because when you've received that love and that love's been expressed to you and in that right manner then you understand it's not just an understanding but it is now that same love that would operate through you and that's the reality even within a home life of where where it comes down with children and everything else they are taught how to love and how to receive love by that of the order that's expressed between husband and wife and wife back to husband are you with me now i realize let me just throw out this disclaimer i realize i'm not preaching to anybody who's perfect and that includes me are you with me now i realize that there's a lot of things that you can you could look back or a person could say brother samuel this but brother samuel that but this is one thing about it that when god has taken a hold of our life there's not one person that's here tonight that's too big that's too high that can't say god that you would just come down in a special way and just speak to my heart and help me lord help me to live that out because there there's a desire in our heart to have that reflection of christ within our lives so within this we we see that even where things would get to in in this hour where it would speak of how it was in the days of noah even how it was in the days of lot the conditions would be upon the earth again in this hour now brother brown would say it like this in invisible union he said marriage is the oldest institution in the world marriage was performed first and instituted in the garden of eden now brother brown will take this in this way and just to lay this for a foundation of what i'm going into brother braham will take this when he's speaking of of you know even man and woman coming together in that of of a holy matrimony in union and he'll deal with ahab and jezebel and brother brahma will continue to take these examples over and over and he says it like this he says just like today when a christian boy marries a sinner girl or a sinner girl a christian boy that starts something right then don't you get married unless you're equally yoked together with believers to keep trouble down when god made men and women this is what i want you to get when god made men and women in the beginning he made their spirits then there's someone for you i'll tell you i just love this how that god would just speak so personally in the message of the hour and what a comfort it is and not only just the comfort within that because we see the part of what it ties to with that within the spiritual realm that you and i think about in your own life that you and i even as young people and on and on tried to find different things to satisfy a first that was in your life there are things that people could go and look at on the now on the internet they could try to take the bottle they could try to take cigarettes they could run around and everything else trying to satisfy a desire that's on the inside but that desire on the inside was for reality and all every one of those things right there will leave you empty it'll leave lives messed up but there is a longing on the inside for reality and there's only one person that can satisfy that thirst on the inside that will raise a life from a life of sin to a life of righteousness in jesus christ and that is god himself coming on the scene and dealing with that life where you and i could walk for years and think man i don't seem like i can fit in you can try to fit in all you want to with the world but you'll never fit in with the world why there's a part of you that belongs to god that's a part of you that really is god and it's god that pulls upon that part our spirit and our flesh can resist it but there's a part down on the inside just like that i would have a sim card in this phone right here it receives a signal when a signal is sent to my phone if there's no sim card there's no receiving of a signal you could send texts and call and text and call but i'll never get it unless i've got the sim card and the sim guard has to be activated into the network you know what i'm talking about for by one spirit we are baptized into one body then we receive divine communication is that right so there's a part about it that that part that only can be satisfied by almighty god and that is the part that even within the positive that is actually it lays out here in the negative of even in that part of men and women as brother ram said in the beginning he made their spirits then now let's look back at this in genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our own image after our own likeness let me move on to verse 27. so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful multiply replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over every living thing that moveth upon the earth now we recognize that then from this in genesis 1 it goes to genesis 2 that here we find that god he places that man that he has made in his image and likeness he places it within a flesh body adam names all of creation as we looked at last week he says this is cal and this is horse and he's naming it by the characteristic as it is revealed to him because he's in tune with the mind of christ is that right you see this is where we've been brought back to as a son and daughter of god back to that same dominion that same have the same mind of christ to operate in our life but yet here they are one in spirit here is here is man here is adam and remember the bible says that in the day that god created them he called their name adam they were one when god created that of the original spirit it was male and female it lay right there within adam but then god in order to provide a helpmate for adam notice a helpmate for adam he put adam to sleep and he took a rib and god began to multiply on that rib god did not move down into another and taken more of a creation but god began to multiply on that rib that was there and god then when the body itself was ready then god goes in and he performs as operation where he separates the masculine spirit from the feminine spirit and he puts that feminine spirit right there in in that of the body of the woman you see the spirit was original the body is the byproduct this is why that even though our bodies are byproduct you came from here and i came from here and you know your mom and dad and so forth but when we receive the holy spirit we're not receiving a different spirit we're receiving the same original spirit is that right so then within that part of it here after god has that set forth now here you have adam the man and here you have that of eve even though she did not have that name at that time she was under that of adam's name and here you find the woman and you find that of them of even that of the feminine spirit that is present there so when marriage was instituted and performed by the lord god between his son and his wife god was uniting them together the spirits are you with me that masculine spirit here and that feminine spirit that was here god was uniting that together in a holy matrimony are you with me you see this is what this is what god was doing now watch how brother brown will place this here and identifying it and he goes into this in questions and answers on genesis and he says you know he says when god had said let us make man in our own image and after our own likeness he made him male and female he made the burly spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate feminist spirit for the woman now this is what god made this is original creation all right the man was made to be burly not a the woman the spirit of the woman tender little delicate feminist her spirit was not made to be burly is that right now notice when jesus here would speak in matthew 19 3 when here the pharisees came to him and tempting him and saying is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female the world could use a little lesson here on that god didn't make an oops oh i should have made you a female you were a male that's that's the world that's satan's kingdom that's perversion are you with me you see the spirit now listen to me now the spirit is complementary of the body the male in body should hold and display a masculine spirit are you with me now while the female in bodies should hold and display that of a feminine spirit what we just read about you see then when we we recognize this because when brother brahmi tells us he says now man and woman was one he's going back to that in genesis 1. and he says now a woman in the beginning he took the woman from adam and man and wife are really one but what was done was so to reproduce themselves to put them in flesh so god had to the whole separation from that of where god divided that of masculine and feminine putting them into separate there into separate bodies was so that they could reproduce themselves again but they would not reproduce a different image because when god made them male and female god never made images he made one image amen that's why that for the bride of jesus christ we do not have any life that's different than his own life that would be reflected in our life if there is something different in a life that says i'm a christian but their life reflects the world it's not reflecting the true image of what a christian is are you with me it shows that they have not truly been born again by the spirit of the living god because the same way that the spirit behave in the body of the lord jesus is the same way that that same holy spirit will behave itself in every son and daughter of god for he said the works that i do shall you do also is that right so here we find that man and wife are really one so god has put it there so that they would reap they could reproduce themselves again brother brown goes on to say it in this way he says when a woman tries to act like a man dress like a man talk like a man she's out of her place a woman is feminish sweet and loving not big and carrying on and acting like a man well she's not supposed to be when she does that her life is perverted she's sweet loving kind where adam is more the burly type for he was the man the masculine type the woman was feminist but it's it's the same spirit for he took her from adam now here is god in the original creation and when we see this how complementary this is god did not make that of a man to be you know where he's a little timid guy and and everything else but he meant him to where that he would be burly now none of these things in here are our directive of of an of a lordship or a dictatorship or or a pushover that's not at all but the two working together are complementary let me just say it to you like this let's bring it down all right there are times in our life that we need the lord jesus to move on the scene in our lives and there's battles to be fought and we don't need him being tender with the enemy we need the enemy's head taken off is that right but then there's times where we need the great tenderness of the holy spirit to move down within our life and begin to deal with our life so that we can receive if it's correction or whatever it is we need him to move on the scene and he is able to do all of those things you see just how he's able to do that he's also with that same spirit and that life pulsating within you and i it brings us to a place of submissiveness of yieldedness to his voice is that right so then what does it do it manifests who you and i are as the bride of jesus christ you're not trying to be that part of the word well i'm going to try to do this i'm it's it's a desire that's within your heart he stirred that desire up and every time he comes by it just stirs that desire up a little bit more aren't you glad we got a husband like that amen i'm so glad about that notice here brother graham goes on to say it again like this he says you know regarding that and i may not have them sister roseanne are you the one running those i may not have some of these quotes okay yeah up up there because i don't know exactly how much i was going to read of them uh so brother braham says it like this he says he says he put that in the woman the love spirit the feminist kind and gentle brothers you know how it is i think i referred to this last week you know my boys and it wasn't because i'm you know some ogre or something like that but you know it's natural when they fell down they ran to mama there's parts about mama how mama's able to nurture them and you know drive put off to you know take off the you know put on whatever needs to be put on the knee if they skin it or whatever more but there's a part that's within that and that mother part never leaves doesn't matter when they're 40 something years old 50 some years old that mother part never leaves same thing with the dad part as well but you know here notice and the bible goes on to say in matthew 19 5 for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh now what twain is he talking about that masculine and feminine spirit remember the spirits here when god made in the very beginning you see how brother graham sets us forth god already has the matches already perfectly made is that right now we also realize brother brown would tell us in 1964 question answers he said if you got the wrong one down here he said don't worry he said all wrongs will be made right over there is that right and you know how brother brown laid it out very clearly if you think it's got the wrong one boy i'm going to go find the right one you need to get the right spirit first are you with me you know brother baby see the spirit of god dealt with these things because this message is a parallel and it works exactly with how that paul himself stood in the early church and laid down a real scriptural order or pattern paul dealt with every one of these parts because it applies to the word are you with me so here now they twain shall be one flesh that's that's a mystery here you have here you have two individuals and here you could look at them and say well i see two people i see a man i see a woman like you'd see my wife and myself standing next to one and you say i see two people but you see when we've really been joined in a real matrimony that part of they are no longer twain that means that part that feminist part that spirit that was out there and the masculine part to correspond to that where we were separated but god has brought it together to do what to express not a divided image but one image hallelujah that's why god sets everything in unity and harmony this is why the spirit of god would write in ephesians 4 endeavor to keep the unity why it burns within our heart because we are not different images but it's one image that's to be displayed is that right so now verse six wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let no man put us under oh my i love how brother branham takes this here he says what god had joined together not one man joined together you know i i realize that even as as i speak and you know no matter where it's at you know even when at times i've been in youth retreats and places overseas and and i you know they they have me and i'm dealing with certain things on this and would ask me to teach on it and things like that i realized that sometimes sitting there there might be parents or older ones who could look at it and say lord thank you for your grace because you recognize god's grace that you didn't have that pattern to follow you didn't have that but god in his mercy and you i'll tell you what it's such an appreciation i i tell you i'm appreciative even though that i sat within a pew and everything else i'm appreciative of the divine arrangement of almighty god and how that god as brother ram says when you've got a direct revelation from god that's your wife and the same thing that's yours the rest of your life what is that that revelation that this is my wife this is my husband that's an absolute that when that when trials come when disappointments come it's an anchor it's an anchor though the gates of hell would try to prevail against it it's an anchor though everything else could be taking place within the world it's an anchor because it's not what man has joined together it's not the minister that joins a man and a woman together it's god that joins them together a minister stands here as a as a as a vessel as a a as a yielded vessel and and you know reading off the valves and the vowels that are that are being rehearsed and these things that are made public before an assembly but you realize oh my how many people can stand and they can rehearse vows but their hearts are not even one with one another it's not even one with one they're even so undecided you know but to thank god that god would come down and in the midst of a marriage ceremony that god himself would be put a stamp with his presence that this is my divine arrangement these are two that have stepped out of eternity into a space called time you believe that oh it's wonderful to think of the grace of god and to recognize that even though in this lifetime here you've walked in this lifetime perhaps raised children and everything else but even there on the other side you'll still be identified together that you walk together in life a fellowship together imagine what it would be like imagine if your spouse wasn't there with you it's something about it that you look at it and say this is a delight that god has arranged and prepared listen to this here brother branham he's bringing this in statue of a perfect man he said you know he said a young man the other day said you think i could ought to get married brother branham to such a such a girl as to how much you think of her oh my i just love her i said well if you're not going to live without her you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not but if it's going to kill you you better go ahead and get married brother bran said what i was trying to get to him was that was this that if you love her so much it says right now before you're married everything is just fine and dandy but after you get married then the toils and trials of life come in that's when you got to be so in love that you understand one another when you're disappointed in her she's disappointed in you you still understand one another see what brother is laying down honor doesn't stop even in you don't even when you're disappointed in one another it's still honor honor is still there because what what does honoring do when we talk about applying the token to our house that of honor and keeping it in that place it invites the spirit of god to move and to direct us to help us are you with me now you see when the scripture says this i'm a little bit off point but when the scripture says this when it speaks of the word husband the very word husband it means a house banned that's what the word is and that word means it's the same word that would be used for when they would take a sheath and have to wave the sheath before the lord to be accepted they had to put a band around that sheaf so god lays that part down of that of of a husband of a life that the responsibility to try to bring that home under the influence and the presence of almighty god and i know i'm speaking even to veteran parents that you know your your children are maybe my age some of them but you recognize this very thing right here that the applying of that token and of that life is the atmosphere that's been created the bible says teach a child when it's young in the way that it should go and when it grows old it will not depart from it is that right and i think we can agree here tonight teaching is more than talking teaching is a life on display because teaching alone will not say we do this and we don't do that and we do no no brother braham tells us when we display the token he said let him see it in you it'll have an effect you see it's reality within that life and how god when we look at that and you might think well they're here maybe your children are not all your children are serving or maybe some are and some aren't but this but but our confidence is in that reality of jesus christ because out there there is no reality there's only one place of reality and only one of real real true satisfaction and that's in the lord jesus christ it's that part right there that presses upon their life that's why when they get in trouble they hunt you up it isn't because you can quote the scripture real good that's not why they call you and ask for prayer it's because they've got confidence you've got contact with god are you with me so what a responsibility when we when we see this here of of that band that comes around it and how that there i i i i it raises up what a responsibility and i know there's more to that but you see it comes to a place in applying that brother brahman says when you're disappointed in her she's disappointed in you you still understand one another that's the way it is with christ we've got to be so in love with him to when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit the only way you can do that is to become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you now i think within all this you know i i read this you know the other night and uh you know when i when right there in the home but i want you just to think of this here in the midst of all that's going on because sometimes you hear things you know where we see signs we see things taking place around us we see that that what was predicted we see things taking place but no man knows the day nor the hour we know we're living in the time of his coming but even sometimes you know that maybe where a person or a young person could say well should i do this right now should i should i go ahead and you know make make plans you know for a career and what's coming on down the road absolutely samuel what if the rapture was going to take place the very day that i started fall semester be in class on the fall semester and let him rapture you brother said if i knew that the rapture was coming in the morning i would study to preach this message see it's not us just waiting around with our hands crossed and our feet laid back and we're living in that time we're not built to be that way we're built as paul would write in first corinthians 15 to be abounding in the work of the lord is that right so even you know when brother brown was asked questions i think questions answers on the seals in other places now notice here he's asked this question brother branham knowing that time is ending and eternity's setting in what would be your advice for a couple planning marriage now he's got every opportunity to say you know what just forget about it don't even think about marriage i mean the time so late but that wouldn't be right that wouldn't be right the bible said enoch walked with god are you with me when god came to mary she was making her normal trip to the well are you with me that's the same way the rapture the rapture is going to be is going about the normal daily activities are you with me glory be to god so now go right ahead and get married go right on just like if you was going to live for another hundred years here on earth just go right on keep your heart set on christ not your hearts on these things of the world but on christ go right on get married children god bless you in your wedding this is advice and counsel that is given to that of even those that would be coming into that place to say you make preparations as though you're going to be here a hundred years but you live as if he could come the next moment you have to make plans for things right right don't worry there'll come a last day that dinner has to be made last day that the towel's got to be washed and last day that you know that the shirts have to be ironed and they'll be one of those last days last days you gotta you know change the the tire on the car there'll be one of those last days is that right but until that time we carry on is that right so marriage is honorable let's look at these things just for a few moments here and i'm going to wrap up marriage is honorable so then every aspect of marriage is to be honorable to be held in honor and that would be honored displayed notice the scripture would write this here in ephesians 5 and paul from here is referring back to places that we've been in genesis 1. and he would write submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god how many times that paul would write of this and he deals with the marriage relationship the same way as peter would deal with it and you'll find over and over the word fear fear does not mean slavishes where you're ducking around fear means reverence to hold in honor submitting yourselves unto one another in the fear of god and you find that here within that that all of this submission is dealing with in reverence of god in verse 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord notice as unto the lord so this word submission it deals with one that would submit or to yield to uh one's admonition or advice uh and here's a very important part it is a voluntary attitude of giving in cooperating assuming ability and carrying a burden notice it's god's instruction is that wives would submit themselves that is not it is not something that's just that if i can say it in this way that is just demanded but god's desire is that it would be something that for that of the wife it would be a willingness it would not be a wrestling it would not be a fighting it would not be a struggling but it would be something that would just be that of willingness to really release that part that is right there amen now notice this i've said it like this before i read this this quote i've said this like this here over the years as well too god desires this order as we read even in the scriptures of where that the man is the head of the woman and christ the head of the man and god of christ and we recognize that that order of how that that's to flow and even though the man is to be the head but it's not something that is just when god would express that it's that it's just well this is just to be uh you know it's just well this is who i am i'm the head of the house but it's to be something that should be residing within the heart of that wife it should be a place that is given like peter could write the hidden man of the heart is that right now notice brother braham will write it like this and he'll say out of the thytarian age you'll say now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition not according to the holy scripture as she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that's commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition well then what is it if it's not of that disposition then it's just like when you have a bruised cell cancer can come in is that right this is where you find things that things can when you look and you can i mean it isn't too hard sometimes to pick out certain things you know when you're walking around and you see certain things you know in stores and and everywhere else and it's a very sad thing i mean when you see the situations where there's such a demeanor uh among that of women and it's a sadness that's there because it's a real it's a harshness and it's though it's that they've got something to prove that i can do this just as good as you can god never put that position there that was never that was never supposed to be there but you see god gave the woman her position and her place and it's a glorious place are you with me it's a glorious place i mean to think of what god himself has done what he has done in order to bring life to you and i as the bride of jesus christ before we could ever lay our lives down he laid his life down he laid his life down so that you and i might be able to lay our lives down what is that submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of god he submitted to the word that called for a kinsmen redeemer and what did that do it had an effect to draw upon our lives when the spirit of god would deal with our life to do what submit ourselves yield to his admonition i don't think tonight i'm not standing here because i have to i'm not standing here because well i have to preach i'm not standing here because well i've got to serve god if i don't serve god i'm going to go to hell if that's how you feel tonight you need to meet the lord jesus that's a slavish ungodly fear that is not the love of god the bible tells us that the love of god that in that love there is no fear there's no torment but it actually gives us a confidence that right now where we're standing that though we're here in this life we have already been accepted in the beloved it's not something i have to do it's the privilege and the pleasure of what can i do for you lord what can i do for you tonight lord what what would you have me to do you see what is that that is a submitting with a voluntary attitude now let's just be honest our first nature didn't want nothing to do with it our first nature ran from it but you can only run so far because there was something on the inside it was a part of him and he would begin to draw that part to himself it was his love his love being projected his love being manifested to you and i it was not harshness and cruelty it was not god coming down with the rod and beating you and iron scaring us to death that would never produce anything but slavish fear but the love of god sure it can point out in a life that if you don't surrender and the direction you're going this is the way you're headed but the love of god will come right back and say but i made a way for you you don't have to remain in that condition you don't have to keep going that way there is a way and i am the way the truth and the life glory be to god he draws us to that place notice this here woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat can you say amen not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat what's a doormat wipe their feet on that's not what a real man does he doesn't make a woman a doormat but she look at this but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house let me just say this to you this is a part that god already put within the female it's part that lays there in that feminist spirit it's not something that she receives after she oh that she receives uh the holy spirit that's already there are you with me that attribute is already there just like a little girl that would go along and she has her first baby doll she's caring for that baby doll you know she has her kitchen set and she's serving you you know plastic donuts and plastic watermelon slices and everything else what's she doing she's imitating things that she saw mama do is that right but what it is is there's attributes that's already in there you give her a little puppy she'll she'll mother that little puppy along just as a little girl why the attributes are already in there is that right but in the proper season and the proper bed of time are you with me now they will come out and into expression because the bible says for every purpose there is a season is that right so it's a preparation for that season in order to come forth that's what we were looking at last week so then when we look at this part of it it's a natural part now here's the thing that works within this it's also satan's desire to work on the man especially in this hour it's been this way for years and it works it's that feminist agenda that started clear back in the 1800s i know you may not know that but i've studied this for a few years it started clear back in the 1800s seeds that were sown even when they had that sexual revolution in the 1960s that was some of the product of what was sown in the late 1800s it's seeds that have been sown this is why even the prophet is telling us with certain seeds that were even being sown in that hour and he would take a a sitcom or a show by the name of i love lucy and what everybody else would look at and say what's harmful about that i mean if you you know nowadays no doubt there are no doubt things that you could look at and say there ain't nothing that i love losing brother would say susie you know there ain't nothing to that but you see what it was it was seeds that was being sown it was actions it wasn't so much that you know i think it was lucille ball whoever that she was you know maybe outrightly calling her husband a dummy or anything else like that but it was how that she was acting in disrespect i'm telling you image is more powerful than words and that's what the prophet was dealing with that's why i said when you let he said your children watch all of these things on the screen and men and women swapping over one another he said they'll be practicing the same thing the next day why it's images that's set forth but aren't you glad there's been another image there's been another image brother it hadn't come by television it's combination of the word in this hour that is set forth of what a real man and woman is what a real marriage is it set forth who the real bride of jesus christ is because it is revealed jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and when he begins to reveal himself his mate is drawn to him in love and brother it's a match literally made in heaven hallelujah glory be to god in the highest oh my notice he said if she breaks that image that god made for she's perverted any male that lets this is important now any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted this is why as we were saying natural things that are pertaining you know a man said well you know i'm gonna my wife you know i think she's more spiritual perversion i said that's perversion there's something not right there there should be a real confidence a man is to have a cut not an arrogance are you understanding me confidence is not arrogance you do not want a man who's wishy-washy you don't want a pastor who's well you know what i don't know about this i i don't know how to believe about this i don't know what i think you don't want a pastor that way are you with me you want a man who'll stand on the word and on the convictions of what god has revealed to him and hold that absolute over the congregation that's a standard of god's word and what is it it's not the man himself because that man may not have a lick of confidence in himself which he shouldn't it should be according to the working of the holy spirit in his life but he's got confidence in that word that god has revealed that the word will perform just exactly what it said it will do [Applause] hallelujah and that's why with a husband a husband that's a part that a woman craves to be led to be directed when that doesn't happen this is why you find things all out of order this is why you find things where you know where things where you've got women responding in certain ways they shouldn't be responding they shouldn't they shouldn't be out there it shouldn't be in that way well i think this and i think this this shouldn't be that way the bible says if the woman is to learn anything let her learn in silence are you with me not putting all of her things out there now they've got all kinds of platforms that everything can be put out there but you see it's a part that's natural it's natural and if that part as a husband is not fulfilled god will hold the husband accountable because he's not actually serving according to the image that god created him to be in my goodness it's a very important the man himself should be the head of discipline in the house should be the one who directs it either it's pricking or we're just listening it should be that direction that's given there there should be that direction that's that's moving on there within that home because when it does what that actually does it allows then that wife to flourish in the place that god has called her to dwell in oh my for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body you see this responsibility i'm going to pull up here this is a responsibility that the husband has for the husband is head of the wife headship itself is an ultimate is a is an awesome responsibility when i when i use the word awesome here i do not mean something lightly like hearts it's to be reverenced the responsibility that one is coming into or has because to serve in that capacity as head is responsible for all provision responsible for protection history is responsible for the comfort of life to provide all of those things with what's necessary and the comfort of life for comforting that that's a big responsibility headship is not something that's just well i'm the head of the home and pardon me for saying this but how it is nowadays i'm the head of the home and where's he at in the basement with video games preach brother samuel i will he's the head of the home and she's doing she's running everything that's an agenda of seeds that was sown back there that's coming out now to demasculinize a man but all of this is being placed within those plates you said brother samuel oh that that really no it's very necessary this is very necessary to be taught if paul by the spirit of god would have paul to put this in the scripture and brother branham would lay on this time and time again it's very necessary because it goes back and forth with the spiritual so it's something that's a great responsibility for that husband great responsibility oh my let me just you're probably saying whew man we're done now we can move on can i have just two more minutes verse 24 therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything see as the church is subject unto christ well how is the church subject this word subject is the same word submit comes back to we're not in bondage we're free i'm not doing what i have to do because i have to do it brother dan daisley told a story i think his brother dan yeah brother dan days they told a story it might have come out of the message but i i didn't even plan on this but it comes to mind right now there was a woman here she was married and her husband had all of this list of things to do and here she is doing this doing that she's doing it all she does it all everything you know that he's asked she comes you know to a place of very grieved you know but they don't separate or anything like that finally it comes to a spot that he passes away he passes away and you know she's younger or whatever the age is and she gets married again once she gets married she's up in the attic and she's looking at all those boxes and things like that and she finds this long list and she starts reading it well nobody knows what's going on she just starts laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing well what it was she was laughing at the list because everything that she had to have that list for to do this to do that and from the first husband she didn't need it for the second husband she wasn't even thinking of it in that way she just did it see that's the same way it is when god brings about a real change in a person's life you can do things i have to do this and i have to do that and all those things are our parts don't don't misunderstand me those are all parts but to understand that's not the final resting place the final resting place is then where you're looking at the word and the bible says his commandments are not grievous it's where you find yourself just it's being lived out in your life and it's joy you're you're laughing like that woman was just joy because you realize the struggle has ended it's no longer i who liveth but christ who liveth in me so as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and it goes on to say as it says in everything and you realize from the scripture there in colossians 3 18 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as is fit in the lord so when we look at everything it's as is fit in the lord remember brother brown tells us in this way he said if your husband maybe you have an unbelieving husband or something like that and he says well you know what you're not going to church anymore i think of one sister you know that coming and she said her husband said i don't want you going back to church no more and this sister said do you really want me to make that decision do you want me to make that decision she said because i think you know what decision i'll make you'll be left here alone why i'm going to the house of god see the word remember the word is first in everything as is fit in the lord so when she said i'm not going to stay here you're trying to stop me from going to church she was doing as unto the lord she was right where she needed to be are you with me because even when a wife is submitting to the husband she's doing it as unto the lord verse 25 husbands love your wives even as christ i got to leave you with this one here this let me leave you this this might be a little bit of not not salt in the wound because i don't believe there's any wound this is just teaching tonight but it'll help you give a little honey with it husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it this love here it requires more than just feeling o love this word is a god for love it's unconditional it's the same love we were writing reading about here does not behave itself unseemly does not seek its own like it's my way or the highway it does not think no think it does not think evil i remember last january january 22nd you did this you always think of no evil this is what this love does this is why we must have that love agape love permeating our earth because this agape love you know what it'll do it'll cleanse us it washes us it cleanses us think about it tonight if the love of god coming to our hearts think about it of even the things i heard brother paul say up here moments ago of things that maybe thoughts and other things like that think of the love of god that comes to do what cleanse us keep us clean to help you and i'd be reminded that we can be reminded of who we are he reminds us he wants us to know that so well brother brown would say it like this in desperations and i'm closing he says now he says sister again roseanne go down to that where it says if you said can you do that did i have that do i have that on there oh yeah okay good if you said you loved your wife and never tell her about it never sat down make love to her expressed it to her kiss her hug her you know all that mushy stuff and tell her she's the best cook in the country i mean come on if the biscuits went from being burnt till they're fluffy hey it had to be some praise right where the rice tastes like rice like mama made come on now because you know it's dangerous if you go to saying this ain't like what mama made you're in trouble if you don't know that by now you're in trouble so matthew god terry's don't you ever compare try to compare somebody to your mom's cooking your mom is a good cook but don't you ever try to do that if you said you loved her and you never tell her about it never sit down and make love to her express it to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it how many is glad that god expressed his love to us aren't you glad that god doesn't say hey i already told you one time what i need to tell you again if i ever change my mind i'll let you know he doesn't do that as a matter of fact he'll come you might be right in the middle of the day in a time when you're in your lowest or your weakest maybe it's a time where you've been wounded or something's happened or whatever and he'll come right to his presence will come isn't it tremendous of even of times if we could say it back to this because it's not based on works of even of times that we don't deserve not that we ever deserve but you understand what i'm saying in times that we could say boy i mean we could feel it like this but here he'll come sweeping down in his presence and you know his presence when it comes like that you know he's letting you know i love you i love you i love you when you go to pray and you begin to thank him you know how it is when you begin to talk to the lord in prayer sometimes you know you might seem like my i feel so twisted up in my spirit i feel so i don't even know how to start i i don't even feel like this is the flesh i don't feel like praying but you realize if i can just get in there and start to say lord i love you i appreciate you so much lord jesus for where you brought me from how you've changed my life lord how you've helped me day after day how you've given me strength lord in my body how you lord god given me grace through tests and trials and you begin to find that as that praise begins to go forth it begins to worship what's happening it's creating an atmosphere of honor that he'll come down for he dwells in the praises of his people amen oh my let's bow our heads heavenly father lord as we thank you lord for such an example a reality that lord tonight that we're not just looking at things lord that really that pertain to husband and wife but we're looking at it lord in a very spiritual manner this is where paul could write this is a great mystery which i speak concerning christ in the church and lord we can relate to that as your children we can relate to that as the wife of the lord jesus that lord we're not here tonight because of a fear we have to be but we're here because we love you every day of our life lord the desire is to please you i think of it lord there's times where there's things that lord is a faithful husband you would come and let me know samuel that's that's not pleasing it may not even been anything that was said it might have just been the attitude lord you're so mindful you come with such with such love you realize lord it isn't something that's just mushy but it that love itself is such a revering and a respect it's such an honor lord but what it draws out of our lives is a real
