in this service I pray that you will help me Lord to yield to you you may be able to come and speak encouragement to the people Lord direction and guidance you are and pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen turning wood to your Bibles to John chapter 12 John chapter 12 and I want to read verses 20 through 28 John chapter 12 verse 20 and there were certain Greeks among them which came up to worship at the feast and the same came unto Philip which was a bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hated his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal if any man served me let him follow me where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I into this hour father glorify thy name and there came a voice from heaven saying I have glorified it and will glorify it again amen you may be seated I want to speak on the hour has come the Greeks came and they sought Philip and Andrew brought him to Jesus they were sought saying they wanted to see Jesus but the Greeks were somewhat disappointed because the scripture goes on to say in the 37th verse that though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him they were expecting something different how could someone be expecting more than the Word made flesh them in their mess but the problem was they didn't recognize it they all they seen was a man all they seen was another Jew but the elect could see something beyond the veil of flesh and know that that was the Son of God the elect today can see him beyond the veil it's by faith that we see it if we see with our natural eye or understand with our human intellect then there wouldn't be no need for faith but it's by faith that we see the Word of God today it's by faith that we see God in one another today Jesus answers them the hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified Moses had told them that the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me and son a man means prophet hours come that the Son of man should be glorified the word glorified there means to to be praised to magnify to show the worth of something to show the worst of something so Jesus was saying the hour has come for me to show my worth dower has come this is our hour this is our our that the son of man be glorified in us this is our our that his name be glorified again Jesus told how that the worth was going to be manifest he said verily verily I say unto you except the corn if we'd fall in the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and if I be lifted up verse 32 from the earth I will draw all men unto me this he said signifying the death that he would die if we're ever going to see the worth come out of ourselves then we're gonna have to die to self accept the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth it alone if we died itself then there'll be much fruit come forth Jesus trying hours affected greatly the disciples that were with him Jesus said to him in Matthew 26 verse 31 then say it Jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will smite the Shepherd and the Sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee Peter answered him and said unto him though all men shall be offended by the yet will I never be offended Peter Peter was speaking these words and he meant them he was speaking them sincerely but he was speaking them from a gate of his spirit because Jesus later said that Peter hadn't even been converted yet and he said when you are strengthened the brother but he said verily I said to you this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice Peter said to him though I die with thee yet will I not deny thee and we see what happened Paul tells us in 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 that the administration of the Spirit was not the engraving of the law on stones but it was the engraving of the Word of God in our hearts James 1 and 18 it says of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and solidity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls an exodus 31 in 18 it said he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon the mount sinai two tablets of testimony tablets of stone written with the finger of God and Paul's telling us it's not being wrote on tablets of stone today but it's been wrote in the heart and I say this morning is being wrote in their hearts by the finger of God when when we're born again we don't we don't get a new character we were born with a certain makeup about us and [Music] brother branham said that god he had done this that way so would get to certain team in the belt to make us the way we are then if we take and yield those things to God then he used them for his glory then God's glorified through our lives what you receive when you receive the new birth that's what is needed for your character to be molded and shaped and the things we go through many of them are molding and shaping our character and we make mistakes when we're going through them welcome to the potter's house because the mistakes is what he's looking for in order to make us perfect the Potter reshapes the clay until it reaches the perfect image that he had in his mind of what it should be and the message of the communion the ramen says now if God did not spare his own son from cruel testings then he will not spare you or I from cruel testing and Jesus was confronting the greatest test that he ever had and that was at Gethsemane that was the greatest test that he ever faced it was the greatest victory that he ever won because it was there in Gethsemane where he accepted it it was there in Gethsemane where he took all the sins of the past sins and present sins and future sins upon him no one else could have done it but him because it was God in man it's the greatest victory ever won all the demons of torment were standing around to try to tempt him and try but he proved his great Messiahship when he said not mind will but thine be done there's where the great victory was amen there's where we could say like he put his foot down he meant and he died out to self because you remember he said he come and prayed and said if it be possible let this possible let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done there's where he died out to self brother Branham says in another place that God left him in the garden and he went to the cross as a man knows God couldn't die but he took on our sins amen and the hour had come the hour and for the cause that he had come to that hour had come to be the hour is come that the son of man be glorified the hours come again that the son of man be glorified through you through the things that you go through how you approach them how you weather the storms that of your lives what you your conduct when you're going through a trial you realize your family sees your conduct and though we would like to think that we never ever get a trial from one of our dear brothers and sisters sometimes it happens sometimes we find out it ain't them at all its us they're not the one that needs straightened out we are it's not what they're doing it's our attitude about it do you realize God will let things come your way that will just twist you and turn you inside out just so he can work in your life and mold you into what he wants you to be Jesus was fully aware of what the things that were taking place the disciples were not aware Jesus says in Matthew 16 if you want to read it with me Matthew 16 verses 21 through 23 it was conveying his death and he says from that time began Jesus is showing to the cybers how he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from the Lord that this shall not be unto thee but he turned unto Peter and said get thee behind me Satan thou art offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those things that be of men now Peter was not Satan neither was he of Satan but he was being anointed by Satan in his spirit round Peter filial love Jesus to the greatest capacity that he could and the devil began to play on Peters filio love for Jesus he said this ain't gonna happen to you I'm not gonna let it but it was the will of God and Peter's filial love was against the will of God minute listen friends God's plan doesn't fit with our filial love God's plan for our families does not fit within the confines of our filial love you know what filial love is it's human love later on in the scriptures when after Jesus had rose and you know Peter had denied him and Peter had felt that well everything was lost for him and so he said I'm gonna go fishing and we know when Jesus came on this shores there and bid Peter to come and Peter jumps out of the boat and comes in and Jesus asses him Peter lovest I leave when you look that up in the Greek he says Peter filio thou me Peter says yes Lord and then he asked him another time Peter loved me with your human love can you love me with your human love filial without me and he says yes I do then the third time he asked him in that time he says Peter agape oh thou me lovely with the godly love that's what we've got to do is love God with a perfect love the agape love our love for our family should not be above our love for God if it is I'm telling you you're never going to fully reach your family because if God doesn't mean any more to you than that why should he mean more to them than what they already have Jesus was the greatest thing that had ever happened in Peters life no wonder Peter loved him so greatly with the human love with Peters human love he loved Jesus more than anything but he didn't have that agape love yet he loved the fellowship but it was Jesus's time to show his worth it was time the hour is come the Son of man be glorified and after after he was gone Peter was going to be tested greatly himself he said Satan desires that sift you as wheat I pray thy faith fell denied he was going to be tested greatly himself why because his hour would come that the Son of Man be glorified through Peter you remember when Peters hour come he said I'm not worthy to be hung like my Lord hang me upside down and they hung him on a cross upside down Peter was crucified his hour had come remember when they came for Jesus Peter showed that love you had for Jesus again he cut off the ear of one of the men you know Jesus reached and got the year we know and he put it back upon the fella and healed you know that that healing was never mentioned in the trial never once was that healing mentioned in the trial but Peter witness did you see the things that Peter witnessed how Jesus conducted himself in the midst of these things made a great impression upon Peter that's why when it came Peter's hour but Peter was able to do what he did Peter was able to stand there and say go ahead and kill me just don't do it like you did my lord from not worth Peter was able to withstand every test because he had watched Jesus Christ and how he conducted himself when his our king you don't realize how many around you are watching you and watch how you conduct yourself your other brothers and sisters the Saints they watch how you conduct yourself in your trials sometimes people in the midst of trials that want to look around for sympathy what good is sympathy do you what good does it do for someone to feel sorry for you it don't change the events it doesn't change the situation and how does it really make you feel better it does but we look for symptoms because we're sitting there inwardly in our in our conjure crying why mean why is this happening to me it's happening to you because this is your hour the hour has come that the Son of Man be glorified through you he's glorified through you by how you conduct yourself by how you let him shape you in the midst of your trials that glorifies the Son of God after Simon put his sword up Jesus told him put his sword in achieving he said the cup which my father given me shall I not drink it in other words this this it's what the father has to give me Jesus didn't complain about it he wasn't whining about it and complaining I say that because I know sometimes we as humans we do whine we do complain I've been there isn't this ever going to end I either split times I went through things I look at my wife and said I can't see daylight but God brought me through just the same and when I come through on the other side it was to my good all things he does for your sakes Paul said all things he does for your sake that we'd be better and friends look we're not here just to live this life we're here getting prepared for another life there are men today that and women that just lived this life and that because that's the only life they're gonna have I remember some years ago I was in Sarasota Florida and there's a bay there off of the Gulf of Mexico and the bay there around Sarasota and there's many mansions that are built around that body of water and there's and I was there this has been years ago probably 20 21 years ago and I was there with brother Danny steamin and we were out fishing and he began to point to me and said this is certain certain persons mansion some big celebrity this another celebrity's mansion and he pointed out to me different ones said that's there so-and-so's mansion and I sit there in that boat and I thought this is their millennium because I'd heard the prophets say that some people are living out their millennium now oh but ours is coming how do you hallelujah I don't care about no mansion here my father has built me a house hallelujah jesus said I go away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also Matthew 26 Jesus says verse 52 told Peter to put a getting sword in his place for all that take up the sword shall perish with the sword think of sound not that I cannot pray to my father and he should presently give me more than twelve legions of angels but how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be I know it's may be perhaps a little difficult at times for us to see when we're going through certain things that we're facing hardships to see how is it that the word is being fulfilled it's because he said that he was going to present to himself a glorious church without spot or wrinkle or any such that blemish he's working and moving amongst us we're preparing to leave here not to stay here we're preparing for a life to come this life is so fleeting if the choice could be put before you have everything you ever wanted in this life even get your youth back and have everything every rich choose everything every that you could possibly want or have eternal life I choose eternal life with God what good would it do to live eternal without God many times when we're going through a trial there are times when we'll approach it with the carnal mind remember the carnal mind is at enmity with God don't look at it with your carnal mind I've seen families go through trials and some member of a family and they're going through a testing are they going to make God number one in their lives are they going to give up everything of the world because you know as humans many humans are tempted to try to hold on to everything they can hold on to and try to serve God at the same time and that won't work and God won't accept that and I've seen an individual for that way and God was testing them whether they would sell out sell out to God give away everything I'm not talking about material things and the family looked at it carnally mom and dad were looking at it carnally and they were serving God too well how can my son get right if he can't come here you get right wherever you are many of y'all know the testimony I might as well just quit dodging around it we all know the testimony my son-in-law David y'all loved him there was a time I kicked him out of the church because he was bringing a reproach upon the believers living one kind of life out there and then acting another life in church his family didn't understand it you know what God had to take everything from him everything the war he was left with nothing he told someone one time he after some years had passed he was out of church he said somebody because he David loves to hunt he said somebody is praying the deer off of me and he told him he says I remember some time when there was a man who prayed the deer up on my stand they said well that's the same one praying the deer off of you I wanted God to take everything don't even let him get no dear Lord he's a wonderful Christian today I loved him deeply you ever heard the same blood sticker in water and it's used a lot in the south well the way I interpret that is that they'll stand for their family make excuses for the wrong ear regardless of what they do because you know blood stick and water you can't come to Jesus with now I look Lord my family you know that's my family blood sticker in water he's not gonna accept that because tell me how family Bloods thicker than the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for our sins goes that blood that blood shall never lose its power the greatest impression you'll have on your loved ones on people that you have testified to people that are watching your life the greatest impression you will have on them it's what you say in the mists of your darkest trials that's when Jesus made the greatest impression upon Peter Peter says this is in first Peter chapter 2 verses 24 what glory is it if when we be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God it's one thing he says when you're buffeted for your faults and you take it and say oh okay but when when you do well he said and suffer for it for even hereunto we were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth now listen what a great impression this made on Peter who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously as he's saying Jesus didn't say you wait oh boy till I come into my kingdom and then you're gonna get it no he reviled not he died to reveal himself to us he died to self to reveal himself to us brother Branham says an inability of God he said now let us dies itself to reveal him to others Hebrews 12 and 2 says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame he didn't despise the cross he embraced the cross the shame of the cross was that they were crucified naked he despised the shame but he embraced the cross he endured the cross and it set down at the right hand of the throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds you ever been going through a valley where you begin to become weary with it and you begin to become faint because of it it says will consider the contradiction of sinners against him when that happens James 1:12 says blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried that means when he's approved when it's his time to show the worth when he has tried he shall receive a crown of life which the LORD hath promised to them that love him the hour has come Matthew five and ten and said blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad boy it's not easy is it it's not easy to rejoice in the midst of when somebody's doing you wrong when you're being persecuted or all manner of evil is being spoke against you falsely how do you rejoice in the face of that it's what you're looking at said for your evil for great is your reward in heaven that's what you're looking at for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you it's showing what company you're in it's showing your identification you see there's people that are gonna have to speak falsely of others there's people that's gonna have to persecute others they're gonna have to fulfill that part of the scripture I don't want to be fulfilling that part of the scripture I'd rather be fulfilling the one that's getting spoke falsely of the one that's being persecuted poor shows what group you're identifying with you're the salt of the earth but if the salt of loss is savour wherefore shall it be salted is since we're good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under the foot of men be salty cause others to thirst so how to do it think of brother Jack Cole where the RAM spoke to him many times and I watched some films on his life and I also watch some films of him speaking and he gave a testimony about his mother that you know his mother kind of stood against him when he got saved and was going to church and so on but then he they were having these meetings and he invited his mom and dad to come to impressed upon him to come and in the face of all the opposition she gave him he kept on going but she came to this service and before they even had an altar call she made her way up to the front and this is what's stuck in my mind what she said she said I want what Jack's got she didn't know what it was but whatever it was in his life made her thirsty for it and she told the preacher I want what Jack Scott he are the light of the world let's see that's set up on a hill that cannot be hid we don't know who all is watching us we don't know who all is watching our conduct when you're in the hospital you don't know the lives that you may touch while you're in there what nurse or what doctor may see something you don't know doctors and nurses are not beyond saving there are people in Smyrna Church age whether ahem said the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters a sign of his love and approval whose approval on any of us is only in the beloved to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us from the foundation of the world does he love us yes but how shall we know we know because he said so and manifested he did love us where he brought us unto himself and gave us his spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said by conducting myself with joy and missed the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass James says my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that that trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and tire and wanting nothing first Peter chapter 4 verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you don't think you're the only one that's going through it don't think you're the only one that's facing trials or think that yours is worse than anybody else's if we were be truthful with ourselves sometimes we could look around and see some things that others are facing that's a and I think man I'm glad that's not me facing that I need to pray for him rather than what I hear I've heard different times why is this happening to somebody else who would you wish it on we rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God rest upon you on their part he's evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified and that's something and that wonderful on your party is being glorified this the hour is come that he be glorified in you verse 19 says wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit to keeping into the souls of him in well-doing as unto the faithful creator for this cause came I unto this hour Paul writes in first Corinthians and says there is no temptation taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it he's not going to attempt you above what you're capable of we might at some time looking say boy I think I'm reaching my limits but he knows your limit and he's not gonna he's not going to tempt you above that you're able Paul says and he's going to provide a way of escape so that you can bear it not you're waiving
