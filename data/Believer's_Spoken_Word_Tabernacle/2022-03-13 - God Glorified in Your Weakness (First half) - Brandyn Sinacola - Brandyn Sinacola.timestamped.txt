[36:04] forever
[36:06] [Music]
[36:25] amen we greet you in the name of the
[36:27] lord this morning if
[36:28] you can stand i won't sing a special so
[36:30] you don't got to sit any longer
[36:35] if you want to open to psalms
[36:38] chapter 33 we'll just jump right in here
[36:43] i was finishing the service message i
[36:46] was listening to
[36:48] and study
[36:49] and
[36:51] is this all okay brother do i got that
[36:53] too high or anything
[36:55] okay
[36:57] and just before i got here
[37:00] i i just i was thinking and then
[37:02] you know you think on the service and
[37:04] you try not to get in your head what the
[37:06] service will be like and just let god
[37:08] lead
[37:09] um
[37:10] even feel a little bit
[37:12] more prepared and then
[37:14] you sit in the office and as the songs
[37:16] get sung and
[37:18] you know that you're getting ready to
[37:19] come out you realize how inadequate you
[37:22] are and then
[37:23] you think oh lord
[37:25] but um the prophet said something in his
[37:28] prayer
[37:29] and i i just wanted to read it because i
[37:31] just uh
[37:33] i have a real burden for this
[37:35] right now
[37:37] and he says
[37:39] we'll read in psalms in just a moment he
[37:40] says may may ever who wears these
[37:42] handkerchiefs be healed
[37:44] may broken homes be re-established
[37:48] may little children without a father
[37:50] without a mother and them separated may
[37:53] that home be united again
[37:55] granite lord heal all the sick now and
[37:57] the afflicted get glory unto thyself
[38:00] but i just i thought that was real
[38:02] special because
[38:03] there's a lot of situations and and
[38:06] i have a bad memory so even if you told
[38:08] me yours i probably don't remember it
[38:10] standing here this morning but
[38:12] um you know there's situations back home
[38:14] that
[38:15] just real burden forward praying for and
[38:18] i just thought that was real special
[38:19] that the prophet would say that
[38:22] may broken homes be reestablished and
[38:24] those that are separated
[38:26] may they be united again so
[38:28] just hold on to that if you come from a
[38:30] broken home this morning amen
[38:33] psalms 33 and verse 12
[38:38] and we'll read to the end blessed is the
[38:40] nation whose god is the lord and the
[38:42] people
[38:44] whom he hath chosen for his own
[38:46] inheritance
[38:48] the lord looketh from heaven he
[38:49] beholdeth all the sons of men
[38:52] from the place of his habitation he
[38:54] looketh upon all the inhabitants of the
[38:56] earth
[38:57] he fashioned their hearts alike he
[38:59] considereth all their works
[39:01] there is no king saved by the multitude
[39:04] of and hosts
[39:05] a mighty man is not delivered by much
[39:08] strength
[39:10] and horse is a vain thing for safety
[39:12] neither shall he deliver any
[39:14] by his great strength
[39:17] behold the eye of the lord is upon them
[39:19] that fear him upon them that hope and
[39:21] his mercy
[39:22] to deliver their souls from death and to
[39:24] keep them alive and famine
[39:27] our soul waiteth for the lord he is our
[39:29] help and our shield
[39:31] for our heart shall rejoice in him
[39:33] because we have trusted in his holy name
[39:37] let thy mercy o lord be upon us
[39:39] according as we hope in me amen
[39:44] if you want to be remembered in prayer
[39:45] if you just want to lift your hand we'll
[39:47] pray before we start and god bless you
[39:51] heavenly father we come before you lord
[39:53] and we
[39:54] we just approach your throne lord one
[39:56] more time before we bring your word
[39:59] realizing lord that
[40:02] father so many times god i just i
[40:05] i feel so young i feel so young in the
[40:07] ministry and
[40:09] and lord not that we want to compare
[40:12] ourselves amongst ourselves but there's
[40:14] many
[40:15] men lord more capable of
[40:17] of handling your word than i am
[40:20] but father look down upon us lord as the
[40:23] scripture said lord i look to you the
[40:25] people are looking to you lord they
[40:28] they see me father but they're coming to
[40:30] hear from you
[40:32] and so i pray god that you would speak
[40:34] lord every need behind every hand father
[40:37] you know what it is
[40:39] lord you knew god that they would raise
[40:41] their hand this morning maybe some
[40:43] feeling too weak to raise their hand but
[40:45] lord they have something on their heart
[40:48] go to them lord i pray you would speak
[40:50] now and
[40:51] be with brother sam this morning and i
[40:53] pray father that you would give him lord

[42:23] and uh god just just seemed to open it
[42:26] through something that was on my heart
[42:29] you know just thinking i'm a imperfect
[42:32] man
[42:33] and
[42:34] make many mistakes and many many faults
[42:37] and failures and things that i you know
[42:39] i wish wish i didn't do and then you
[42:41] know you just you go through this whole
[42:43] process of how how you think about
[42:45] yourself you know and
[42:46] looking in the mirror and seeing
[42:48] you know who you are
[42:50] and and you know we we really we got to
[42:52] look through the mirror of god's word to
[42:54] see who we really are but the devil
[42:56] likes us to look in the mirror and and
[42:58] reflect on
[42:59] on ourselves and and you know just our
[43:02] weakness and
[43:03] and i was thinking you know even about
[43:05] some things in my life i wonder lord
[43:06] well how you know how long lord before
[43:08] that you know how long do i got to be
[43:10] this way and when when does deliverance
[43:13] come and you know you think you think
[43:15] about all these things go through your
[43:16] mind and and then i just the thought
[43:18] came to me one day and i thought you
[43:20] know i wonder if i'm doing things in my
[43:22] own strength i wonder if that's part of
[43:23] the problem
[43:24] and then i remembered a message that the
[43:26] prophet preached perfect strength by
[43:28] perfect weakness and
[43:30] so i've been i've been thinking about
[43:32] that that's been on my heart and then
[43:34] i read the psalms and i just what what
[43:37] jumped out to me about the psalms as
[43:39] it's talking about the lord
[43:41] and and
[43:42] his eyes are on the people of of the
[43:45] nation his eyes are on you know
[43:47] the scripture says his eyes going to and
[43:49] fro throughout all the earth
[43:52] and and so i was just thinking about
[43:54] that how the lord is constantly looking
[43:56] upon us we're always in his sight we're
[43:58] always on his mind you can't you can't
[44:00] go to any depth paul said
[44:03] you can't go from a height to a depth
[44:05] you'll never escape the love of god
[44:07] and you'll never escape the vision of
[44:09] god you'll never you'll never go too far
[44:11] where god loses track of you amen and
[44:13] you and you'll never be good at so good
[44:16] that god's you know that you're that god
[44:18] says you know what you're so good in
[44:19] your own strength why don't you come up
[44:21] next to my throne now you'll never do
[44:23] that because the bible says that our
[44:25] righteousness is as filthy rags so the
[44:27] very best that you can present to god
[44:29] god says i'm sorry but that stinks in my
[44:32] sight
[44:34] so i was just looking at that and i
[44:36] thought man this is but look at look at
[44:38] this how he says he fashioned their
[44:40] hearts
[44:41] so god makes a people
[44:44] with all of our faults and our failures
[44:46] and and he's made you he's he's made you
[44:48] a bent a certain way and and you know he
[44:51] he he made you maybe you have more
[44:53] passions than the other or or maybe you
[44:56] have something about yourself you know
[44:58] you you gotta have it exactly right i i
[45:01] don't know i can't remember what i
[45:02] preached on the last time but maybe i
[45:04] mentioned you know i'm a perfectionist
[45:06] and you know you look at those things
[45:07] and you and you just you think you know
[45:10] why am i bent so much this way and and
[45:12] you know brother branham said that if he
[45:14] if he was out hunting if he didn't hit
[45:16] that squirrel right in the eye
[45:18] he was he was disappointed it wasn't
[45:21] good enough he had to hit that thing
[45:22] right dead on
[45:24] and you know so that translates over
[45:26] into his ministry we see and so you you
[45:29] wonder why god has made you with a
[45:31] certain makeup that you have and it's
[45:33] not to give excuse for sin and it's not
[45:35] to not to give excuses for things you
[45:38] know a temper and things like that um
[45:41] you know you need to bring that to the
[45:42] lord i'll do respect to you if you got a
[45:45] temper you need to you need to be at the
[45:47] altar
[45:48] and get that thing under control amen
[45:52] i'm just letting god lead so whatever
[45:54] comes out is coming out
[45:57] brothers is it okay if i move this off
[45:58] to the side a little bit okay thank you
[46:01] i just feel like i'm going to bump it
[46:04] um
[46:05] but it i'm not even off my first
[46:07] paragraph so
[46:09] but you know it's it's god's god's made
[46:12] us this way
[46:13] and and he's fashioned us this way and
[46:15] and one one of the scriptures i've
[46:17] always struggled with and i still
[46:18] struggle with it to this day i just try
[46:20] to have faith but it says can the clay
[46:23] say to the potter why have you made me
[46:25] thus
[46:26] and i have a hard time with that because
[46:28] oftentimes i'm saying lord i
[46:30] i know the scripture says not to do this
[46:33] but i don't understand myself
[46:35] why why did you why am i this way why
[46:38] did you make me this way and really i
[46:40] don't think that there's a problem in
[46:41] asking god those types of questions
[46:44] right
[46:45] you you can ask god lord show me why why
[46:48] is this a part of my makeup
[46:50] the question to ask is lord how can this
[46:53] be used for your glory
[46:55] what what do you want to use this for in
[46:57] my life what what is this there for it's
[47:00] it's not just for me to struggle along
[47:02] through life but lord
[47:04] and maybe it's just so that i learned to
[47:07] to to stay close to you and and bring it
[47:09] under subjection to you but what what
[47:11] can you use this for today
[47:13] amen and yet
[47:15] god with all of our weaknesses and
[47:17] everything that he made us with
[47:20] he he's always looking at us
[47:23] his eyes are always upon us
[47:25] you you feel low about yourself like i
[47:28] do sometimes and yet god is always there
[47:31] and he's always loving you
[47:32] despite those things it's an
[47:34] unconditional love that you know you
[47:36] might you might not understand love
[47:39] because maybe you didn't get it as a
[47:41] child properly
[47:43] maybe maybe your mom and dad you know i
[47:46] was listening to he's actually a
[47:48] christian comedian
[47:50] and he was saying you know he was
[47:51] sitting around with this group of of of
[47:54] men and they were kind of bashing it was
[47:56] a dad bashing session you know like i'm
[47:58] you know my dad was this and i didn't
[48:00] get this in life and and this and
[48:04] this comedian said i was sitting there
[48:05] and he said all of a sudden it hit me
[48:07] and he thought
[48:08] let's turn this into a positive thing
[48:12] and he said you know he's looked at the
[48:13] one and and i think his dad might have
[48:15] been on drugs too and he said
[48:17] you don't you have never
[48:20] taken a drug in all of your life
[48:22] and he said that's because
[48:24] you watched your dad hooked on drugs
[48:28] he said so you ought to think your
[48:30] father
[48:32] because through that example you realize
[48:35] that i don't want to be that way
[48:37] and through that it made you a better
[48:39] person you might not have received the
[48:41] love that you should have from your mom
[48:44] your parents might have passed away when
[48:45] you were young or one or the other
[48:47] passed away and so you raised up with
[48:49] that with that void in your life but i
[48:52] want to tell you this too this morning
[48:53] is that god provides within the body of
[48:55] christ
[48:56] and and so there's there's many men here
[48:59] that you could look to if you didn't
[49:00] have a daddy that you could look to and
[49:03] and see that this this is what a real
[49:05] man of god is like and you can you can
[49:08] use that as an example and fashion
[49:10] yourself after that man amen none of
[49:13] this is in my notes so this is
[49:15] keep pulling
[49:18] and but you know there there's that can
[49:20] create a void in your life and that can
[49:22] create a weak spot in your life to where
[49:24] you don't you don't know how to receive
[49:26] love you don't know how to give love
[49:29] but when you look in the bible and you
[49:31] can you can look even even if you didn't
[49:33] have a good example in your life if you
[49:35] look at the bible you can see how the
[49:36] father loves you
[49:38] that nothing you do can separate us from
[49:40] the love of god and that and that alone
[49:42] tells us he says why you were yet
[49:45] sinners christ died for you
[49:47] so while you were no good before you
[49:50] even could could have a desire to do
[49:52] good
[49:53] christ died for you
[49:54] and so you can look at that and you can
[49:56] grab onto it and you can you can give
[49:58] love to others through that example amen
[50:02] but it's it's it's those things that god
[50:04] allows it's it's it's brother branham
[50:07] called it predestinated trials in our
[50:09] life
[50:10] so your trials are you are are unique to
[50:13] you
[50:14] and yet there's nothing new under the
[50:16] sun
[50:17] so you can't say i'm the only one going
[50:19] through this somebody has gone through
[50:20] that before amen but but
[50:24] it's predestinated to you to your life
[50:26] so that you can become who god
[50:29] god knows what you need to go through
[50:32] to get from the negative to the positive
[50:36] to get from the from the image of of
[50:39] let's just be real of what you are
[50:42] to really who you are
[50:44] to who god sees you as god knows what to
[50:47] put you through and he knows he knows
[50:49] what you have to lose in life and what
[50:51] you what you what you can gain in life
[50:54] and what you know you look at another
[50:56] brother and you compare yourself to that
[50:57] brother and and you say lord but he he
[51:00] has the the nice new vehicle and he has
[51:03] this and he has he's he's living in
[51:05] overcoming life and but why can't i but
[51:07] yet
[51:08] god god has taken him through usually
[51:10] we're looking at somebody older first of
[51:12] all
[51:13] i know i have a lot of peers who are
[51:15] just a year younger than me and and
[51:17] they're so much farther in natural
[51:18] things than i am
[51:20] and many probably in spiritual things do
[51:23] but you know i've always wondered about
[51:24] that but you can't compare yourself
[51:26] because because god knows he's taken you
[51:29] through a channel maybe even for a
[51:31] different work than what that brother is
[51:33] going to have
[51:35] and and maybe you couldn't handle the
[51:37] things that that brother has yet because
[51:39] you need to know what it is to suffer a
[51:41] little bit because of what god has for
[51:43] you coming up amen
[51:45] are you with me so far
[51:47] so i want to open um you can turn there
[51:50] or i'll just read it hebrews 11.
[51:57] and you know sometimes i was thinking
[51:59] too we can think of you know we know
[52:01] where the minister's going so we can
[52:03] just check out you know
[52:06] take a nap i know i'm not as fiery as
[52:08] brother sam
[52:10] so i might not keep you awake like he
[52:12] does but but
[52:15] i've never seen this before in this
[52:17] chapter
[52:18] in verse 32
[52:20] hebrews 11 32
[52:28] paul writes and what shall i more say
[52:30] for the time would fail me to tell of
[52:32] gideon and of barack and of samson and
[52:35] of jephthah and david also and samuel
[52:38] and of the prophets
[52:39] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[52:42] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[52:45] stop the mouth of lions
[52:47] quench the violence of fire escape the
[52:50] edge of the sword
[52:52] it's a pretty good testimony ain't it
[52:54] my goodness we'd love to be that but
[52:56] watch this next part
[52:59] out of weakness
[53:01] we're made strong
[53:04] so you have this this
[53:06] not even a full sentence in itself
[53:10] just uh you could maybe say between
[53:12] brackets you know between two commas
[53:14] there's this this little spot in the in
[53:17] the heroes of faith
[53:19] and it's saying man this this this
[53:21] brother did that and this sister did
[53:22] that and this is the power of god and
[53:25] and you know hold of these things and
[53:27] yet there's this one little part in here
[53:29] out of weakness we're made strong
[53:32] so we look at the strength of these
[53:34] brothers and sisters and the heroes of
[53:36] faith oftentimes and and we think man i
[53:38] want to be that way and why can't i why
[53:40] can't i live like that and in the faith
[53:42] of abraham bless god
[53:44] and yet there's weakness
[53:47] and through that weakness they were made
[53:49] strong
[53:52] brother branham said in perfect strength
[53:54] by perfect weakness just quoting
[53:56] and he says you know i i hope
[53:59] that when i get to the other side he
[54:01] said i hope my my story reads like
[54:03] abraham's
[54:05] and he's saying i made a lot of mistakes
[54:07] and he's talking about mistakes he made
[54:09] in the last year and yet he says he says
[54:12] i hope my story is written like
[54:14] abraham's that when it comes through the
[54:15] blood of christ when i get over to that
[54:18] other side that my story is written that
[54:20] it's my weaknesses are no longer seen
[54:24] but it's what god did in my life because
[54:26] the bible said that abraham staggered
[54:28] not at the promises of god but if you go
[54:30] read abraham he staggered a lot
[54:33] and you think lord how could this be how
[54:35] could this be about his life but it's
[54:37] the same that's going to be written
[54:38] about your life is that even though you
[54:40] feel weak at times even though you feel
[54:42] weak many times
[54:44] it's that's not how god sees you
[54:47] god's looking at you through the blood
[54:48] of christ and he sees you as strong and
[54:51] mighty in the lord
[54:52] he sees you as a perfect work rock
[54:55] through jesus christ amen
[54:58] now there's there's a side i i want to
[55:00] speak on on
[55:03] god glorified
