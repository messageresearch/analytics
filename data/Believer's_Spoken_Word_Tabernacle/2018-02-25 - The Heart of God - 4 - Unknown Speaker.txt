that we would think they need to go he's still good you know there's times in our lives and it sometimes it's easy to worship sometimes it's it's more difficult to but it's it's when we look at it it all comes down to a sacrifice that's when that's when a real sacrifice and you know when you think of how that David even mentioned in the scriptures David said I will sacrifice a sacrifice of Thanksgiving unto you now to think of that even when we don't seem to have our prayers answered for all of these things but David said yet in the midst of all that I will sacrifice a sacrifice of Thanksgiving I'm still going to thank him even when I'm praying and I don't have the answer but I'm going to still think he's worthy we have that we have that assurance that he is working all things truly after the counsel of his own will we just want to just say I just so appreciate having brother Yvonne and his family here I know that brother bonds just come right flowing right back in off of a trip from Honduras and I just prayed that the Lord I know I'm coming here for his for his dad that had surgery and just pray and I ask you just to join with me that the Lord had just refreshed him just blessed blessed the congregation there in in New York also brother hey Seuss and his family god bless you and Carlos jr. or if I can say it correctly Carlito just so glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning let's bless if we could let's turn to the word and on the look in Matthew chapter 26 verse 26 this morning and I know some of you right now we we different ones Itay we've been through a season of the sickness and things like that and it's always nice to have everyone back and yet at the same time I know there's no doubt some that are missing I just can't see it right now but it's good to have sister Shirley here with [Applause] in Matthew chapter 26 verse 26 and as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and break it gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it well this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom amen what a what a promise we are we are living of this promise we're living by this prophet amen we just want to just look at further on the heart of God want to look at pulsations here this morning at least journey into this a little bit let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and I just ask you to remember me as well the Lord oh just give me the strength that I need Heavenly Father what a privilege it is for us to be able to come together Lord Father we know that we're very much aware that there are many others Lord that in other places around the world that don't have even the Liberty to be able to do this right now other believers and father we just we want to say Lord thank you we thank you that Lord that you've provided a place where we can we can come and gather and hear your word Lord were just we're desiring Lord and we are in need of you to take your word this morning and speak to us Lord Lord you know the needs of each and everyone that is gathered here this morning Lord and we pray that you would just come by our way Lord speak to us Lord and here through a slore father without your help Lord God oh my it's it's an impossible task Lord but father we just want to give ourselves to you we asked the Lord for every need that's upon the hearts of your children Lord we we place it Lord there Oh God upon the altar of God and Lord believing Lord Jesus that father as you've said in your word and you've bid us ask the Father anything in my name and I will do it Lord God we just pray that may everything and every part of us be just right in lying Lord and in harmony if it's not lord help us to come into that harmony that father that Lord those requests and desires that we have upon our heart Lord in you that they might be fulfilled Lord father we love you this morning we thank you lord thank you for the congregation Lord grouping a believers Lord that Lord Jesus of lay beside Lord of their time Lord to be in the house of God because Lord we realize that these things Lord our time though it being Lord but a temporal moment but Lord it is eternity Oh God these are eternal things Lord God for it's you Lord Jesus we want to feed upon you Lord this morning father Lord speak to our hearts now I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen God blesses our being seated we know that with when we look at pulsations and many times they'll look at the pulse the pulse or the heartbeat of an individual and sometimes they'll be able to tell whether or not that a person whether they're truthful and you also be able to tell what that person sometimes is going through sometimes we also know that it's things sometimes that can be said that would cause maybe a pulse to really become rapid sometimes it's thoughts that come into our minds and things that would arise and if we would we entertain and we find ourselves and our pulse gets really up but you know there also is what they call a a resting pulse or a resting heart rate and that that really is is well something that they'll use many times to be able to tell where maybe a person is within their health but we know that there is without the heart itself in our body that there is there's just no way for us to live and I think we all agree with that from youngest to oldest but we see that with the heart itself how that such a responsibility that the heart would have were in that it would pulsate and it would send forth not just a gathering of the blood but then it serves to take the blood and and replacing it there in the lungs and then taking the oxygen out of the lungs and putting that through the body as well as taking the different nutrients of foods that we have eaten and breaking down all of those foods and taken that to the the cells of the body that the cells and the different organs and all those things can be properly nourished and at the same time that same blood is what carries away all of the different metallic wastes and things that are within the cells and it moves through the body and within the body as we looked at that that there is a an actual part there even in the body called the spleen that will actually take care of all of the damaged blood cells it'll repair those and break them down and recycle them and and at the same time it'll also bring a cleansing to that to that stream of flowing of blood as well so it's all working to get they're in a great harmony and I'm thankful to the Lord for that and if that in itself we see that it's just in the natural as we can see God would inspire Paul to take that as an example of how that we are to be as a body of believers and truly that's how the body of Jesus Christ is it's it we're not not one of us is the heart within ourselves but we are identified and positioned in that body and it's Christ who is the heart of God he's the heart of the body it's him that that it's his life that is pulsating through the Church of the Living God it's his life that makes sure that you and I it's him overseeing to see that we receive what we have need oven and also to move in our lives to to carry away all of those things that we don't need within our lives and what a what a privilege it is to be identified in Jesus Christ we find that how that you know the Prophet makes this statement and souls are in prison now I've I've always loved this quote but it just even became even more more precious to me as I've been studying this for weeks now he says it's not speaking in tongues and he's talking about evidences and he says it's not speaking in tongues it's it's not by dancing in the spirit it's not by joining a church it's not by fruit of the Spirit Christians science consequence can outsmart anyone that and and even and deny even Jesus Christ was divine it's not bad but it's the word living there it is if they have only looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest now they were looking at him remember they they did see him as far as where he was at with in his physical manifestation they saw that but yet they really weren't looking at what they needed to be looking at because where they had drifted from was the word and that's why the very manifestation of the word is not something that's apart from the scriptures but a true manifestation of the word will always be properly identified in the word because that's the real comfort of a believer you know we can have signs we can have wonders and I believe that signs and wonders are given to the Church of the Living and let me just say it like this I believe that we need them God knows exactly what we need in order to spur and stimulate our faith you think how many times where the Prophet would say now if he will show me something about your life will that help you to believe and we need that we need the testimonies we need to see God moving and coming in confirming his word and that just does something to our hearts as a believer maybe when a a life is surrendered to the Lord or you take where God has moved on the scene and he's brought healing and a life and to think how that we have been out of that maybe that that been offered up in prayer right across here or maybe in prayer closet but nonetheless we know that it's taken God to do it and and that's that's worth rejoicing about with we don't ever want to let that become common because that's God coming by our way and just letting you and I know that I'm still the same I'm still interested in all you might say whatis I know I've been filled with the Holy Ghost for years now but yet the Prophet would even say at the end of third Exodus Lord will you come by our way every now and then again and confirm your word and and make a sign in Denton's bring healing and do something Lord that'll stir our faith you see the real stirring of our faith it doesn't stir us to a personality it doesn't stir us to a church the real stirring of our faith it stirs us to Jesus Christ that's he's the love of our life he's the object of our life he's the one that we want to give ourselves to so when they were looking here at him they looked at him and they called him Beelzebub they said he had a devil day then this is where they were at but Jesus said search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me what he was letting him know is what was written and this is what he said concerning Moses he said you don't even believe Moses riding I tell you those were some really power packed words you're talking to people who knew Moses message and yet he could stand there and say you don't believe it nah they could quote it and somehow it seemed as though that they were living by it but yeah when the word was made manifest of what the heart of it was they rejected it and he told him he said if you believed his writings you would believe my words because you see the writings themselves with when people say I don't want Commandments no more hey when the word is revealed within that word is sealed up the life it's sealed up the nature it's sealed up the very thought behind that word and when that word itself is fully opened and revealed what comes out of there is the very direction and leadership of commandments of the Lord our made manifest that's why Paul could say let whosoever if faker's himself and seemeth to be spiritual a prophet or whatever more let him acknowledge that those things that I have written they are the commandments of the Lord so he had a message that message that was not a different message but what was laying down there in the Old Testament that had been laying there but now it comes forth the season for that which is laid bare and been sealed up it's time for that to be made known and when it's made known it's never contrary to the word that's already written it only lets that word that's been written that people have been tied to and identified with it brings it alive and it issues the very pulsation of God and they become a real true reflection as God interprets his word through their life this is a real reality it's the word living you see there's a lot of when when we look at it there's a lot of demonstrations but you see this is where the Prophet tells us in Satan's Eden he said it's not so much don't watch it so much in demonstration because you see brother Branham he's answering a question there in Satan's Eden because you know when I look at this quote I looked at it over the years I thought how could anybody say that brother Branham won preaching the holy ghost but brother this got back to brother Branham that there been people saying he won preaching the holy ghost and brother Brent said here's what it is he said it is the very person of Christ in you he said to watch it so much in demonstration but watch it the action of the word you see demonstrations can be things of like little things to say well here and this is this is it this is a proofing and yet we need demonstration is that right Paul said in his word he said that our gospel came not unto you in word only but with power and demonstration so there's a need that did that demonstration well the word is coming forth is to make the people aware that the presence of the Living God is there and our God is coming to confirm his word it ought to be something we're looking at it within the word when God sent Moses down there to Egypt he never came with a message that was greater than the promise but it was the very promise that was given made manifest that's why as believers I believe in this hour we are you know maybe not too many of us have been have seen a lot of things where we speak of the the false anointed ones and so forth but I believe we're living in an hour I believe we have been I believe we're living in an hour even right now where it behooves us has the bride of Jesus Christ to try every spirit we're living in that time not to take anything for granted but try every spirit where is this spirit pointing me to hallelujah so in order to try that spirit you got to see what's the projection of the word that's being used now listen don't let down your guard just because we're quotes being read but neither does God wants you to sit here conservative I you understand what I'm talking about you just can't let down on them ever it has to be every spirit it must be tried where is it trying to point us to who is it trying to lift up there's only one great one among us only one and that's the Lord Jesus Christ there's no one equal there's only one it's the Lord Jesus Christ is that right he is the infallible one in our midst thank God for that so they looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and notice the Prophet says and a man that's got the Spirit of God in him or a woman lives that word it lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written epistles read of all men lives that in any other manner maybe don't even own a Bible maybe don't even read their Bible do you realize that your life listen friends the Prophet says it like this he says God because he said the people get away from prayer people get a railway from reading their Bible he said people get into such a condition and when that happens he said God sends a prophet on the scene to do what he has a sign and he brings it on down he says and that prophet in this hour is the Holy Ghost oh ma you see that's why the Prophet the Holy Ghost he never went off the scene as far as the gift and that what God ordained for this hour but remember as a bride of Jesus Christ we are we are ordained as a prophetic class of people the elect or a prophetic class of people we're not prophets but we are ordained to be able to receive that word not by our abilities but it is God himself God has ordained to it that that word would come and illuminate earth it has meaning to our life it is something in that that reaches down and it holds within it what what is really true and we begin to find the mystery of our life beginning to unfold it's a heartbeat it's the heartbeat and the word of the Lord so now when that life that has been the born of the Spirit of God you know you couldn't live you just can't live with demonstration it's got to be a heartbeat you can't live by you know needing to have what we need to have a defibrillator we need to have a defibrillator we need to have you know what God don't want you to have a defibrillator experience come on somebody well we got to keep a defibrillator here at church cuz we got a every once in a while no God God's God has it all supplied that you don't need to live a defibrilator life he's got it supplied that he himself stepping on the inside of you he pulsates his life through you you might get discouraged but greater is He that is in you you might get down but greater is He that is in you it doesn't matter where you're at on the mountain or in the valley he's still the center of your life that's a life it doesn't matter if you're in church or not it's not a it's about a life where your life is there reflecting Jesus Christ you're a reflection of Christ on your job your reflection of Christ in your home you're a reflection on you in your neighborhood you are a reflection of Jesus Christ just such a place that God's design I believe that ought to be the prayer of our heart Lord God let my life be so United with you to where others like they did for Peter they took knowledge they had been with Jesus there was something about them they knew that they had been with Jesus he wasn't because that they could talk Galilee and talk it wasn't because of that but they had been there in the upper room and that image had been pressed upon their heart it had released that seed that was there it came into divine expression and here they were living out the prophecy in that hour that was a living image of Almighty God he's still the same yesterday today and forever in all essence he's still the same the courage the scriptures are clear there's nothing new Under the Sun there may not be words in the Bible about Facebook but there ain't nothing new Under the Sun because when we come back to is is we look at where inspiration sources are coming from is that right it's like right now and I'm not here on a political stump or anything like that because I don't really pay attention to love that stuff but you know it's just like over the over the time or whatever more now I don't want to offend nobody but you know everybody keeps on talking about well gun control this and gun-control that and going but they fail to look at what's inspiring this cuz when you get to look at their inspiration it's gonna take you clear back to the departure from Christ where all these other influence just start coming in and all these other things and you notice a well people you know they're not maybe mentally right now that I can see that I understand that I know that there are things that mentally is not right but I also look at that where the scripture said concerning the days of Noah that they their Bible said that the earth was filled with violence through them somebody's got to be a channel for that demonic inspiration to flow but of their channels for demonic inspiration to flow they gotta be a channel on earth for heavenly inspiration to flow amen I believe tonight I believe right here that I'm part of that I believe we're part of that channels where heaven can actually begin to express itself and that's our parent that I will be done in earth even as it is in heaven you see you look and you found you look and you say well where does this inspiration come from you know for all these creatures looking like this and this and then I told you you know years ago that when the Lord first got ahold my life I was looking at something in a store and I backed up and I backed over on on something you know what I'm trying to get a perspective on something and I ended up backing into one of those um I didn't know at the time but it was when I turned around with on the Star Wars displays and it's such a hideous thing how about jumped out of my skin I really did because I was not expecting that at all but the first thing that hit my mind is where did that inspiration come from where who looks like that I've better never see something like that in the woods and the bow and more than gun and everything else whether that inspiration come from its inspiration when those images are coming on earth if that's happening then there is also channels were the image of Christ is coming upon the earth hallelujah there's another kingdom moving in there's not something way out in the future remember this ministry that God this evening light this message and when we're standing at the very end of time within these things remember it's that ministry that catches the stone as the stone begins to fall it's a ministry what does that ministry do it alerts us to the time to the season to where you and I are living at and where has that stone struck oh it's moved right down and it has broken the very hole of organizational ISM and all enzymes inside the hearts of the bride of Jesus Christ amen a stone that ministry has caught that stone as it's coming out all is not a stone that has been hewed out by the hands or the isms of man but it is a stone that God had provided to absolutely eradicate the very whole of all the things of this world upon your life what do you say it's a rapturing stone it's a rapturing grave it's the capstone of his mercy inspiration it's a heartbeat you know here we find that the Pharisees different ones remember you couldn't put the prophet tells us like this a finger on their life not a finger not a finger you couldn't put one finger on their life but we understand what was beneath the surface was uncovered I said that's a different thing and the word it comes to reveal what's beneath the surface when we look at that and say not a finger on their life we could look at that and say well that wouldn't what aren't they living according to the word yes and no they're living according to the writing or to the print of the word but you see it's really not the word itself being expressed in their life because they're not living by the life that is released in that moment to live according to that word because even when a promise is preparing to be fulfilled God releases the life to catch the people identified in that promise and it's also released to make them ready for when that promise and the season is matured and the people are made ready by that promise so it's not a fulfillment of a promise and then and then it's just let go but everything itself is maturing that's the same way with the promise of the rapture it's not we're just sitting here and waiting around remember the Prophet tells us she the bride will be waiting on that revelation of the rapture it's a quickening quickening quickening quickening it's continually it's gone unfolding and revealing when you and I have need of the rapture might happen tomorrow it might happen in the next hour but God's going to provide what we have need of in order to be ready for that moment that's the promise he's made to himself once you just to hold that in your heart here we find in the scripture my I go back to this scripture here where the Bible speaks of when the Lord Jesus himself when he when he came in this time here they were in Psalm 69 verse 22 if I can read this just for a moment Paul refers to this as well in the book of Romans let their table become a snare before them I want you to notice this carefully God is quick quick to distance himself from even things which he has given when it no longer resembles his purpose when he spoken in the book of Isaiah what did he say in Isaiah he says I don't want no more of your feast yet these are the feasts of the Lord but they no longer resembled what he had given maybe perhaps my letter but not with substance it had become we know as the Prophet tells us it had become just a formality it becomes something that we're just doing and you know friends I'm just going to say it like this it's easy for things just to become formality it's easy this is this is a battle things it's easy for things to become common I'm talking about even in the incoming to the house of God let alone an hour let alone in our lives it's easy for things to become common and we begin to take things for granted instead of coming with expectation we come just you know and our expectation is really just well you know here we are and I'm sure this probably gonna happen or this but you see when there's a an expectation I believe that's what God wants us to have when we have an expectation God Himself moves according to that expectation to where that we're standing in the sound what you think of it the spirit of this age says I don't have need of nothing I'm spiritually rich it sits where that church itself is no more than formality that's all it is it's not something that we're that it's a life or an expression it's something that is just about creeds and ideas and isms but yet within it this is where you and I have to be careful that the spirit of that age we have to be able to say Lord discern my heart that there not be subtle invasions that would somehow lead me from the purpose of which you've told me to we need his help on that bus and I know some it doesn't matter how much you know the message we need his help we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit that he can take things that are rip in there and bring it to light to you and I and when he brings it to light what it actually does light exposes darkness it presses back the darkness any darkness that is trying to overtake your life in your heart in your home the light will press that back that's why David's testimony and there's a reflection of where we stand as the bride the Lord is my light he is my salvation he is the strength of my life so we are victorious because of his victory living through us but his victory living through us that in itself is a victory in us because it's his victory having victory in us it's his life being able to move in not by force but by love subdue us to where he can come to the forefront Oh glory be to God you love him this morning this is our desire so here you find this their table let their table become a snare before them so there was a difference between their table and God's table a prepared table is a table that is set forth in preparation for the fulfillment of God's Word the prophets themselves moved by the Holy Ghost they were moved by divine unction there was a table that was actually prepared within every time every season every age you know down through the Old Testament and every time that table it staff I'm going to tell you who was still the centerpiece of it all Christ it wasn't a different centerpiece they had there it was the same centerpiece every prophecy all the prophets all the Psalms everything was pointing to him though the people in that time they didn't see all of that but you see the life of that promise they were identified in the opening and the morning two of the fulfillment and promise of the Messiah that was to come God released what was needed out of that promise to print to bring to pass over Commerce in that day it's just like when we look at God restoring his word here in this endtime in this hour God released so much of the promise of the complete birth and he released so much in the days of Luther and what did it do the people who came under that word the life itself brought the people in preparation for a further fulfillment of the promise how did it do that by releasing the promise of life that was needed at that time that's why we must come through every step of the word you can't bypass one part of the word it must come word by word he said upon this rock I will build my church hallelujah so we're talking about a table here because when we look at this here there's a table of ideas and those ideas lead the tribulation but then there's also at the same time there's a table where in a where divine revelation the unction of the Holy Spirit the Spirit of God being poured out upon that word and that word living and the people of God beginning to move into that place within the word of a real union with Almighty God there is a table of divine revelation where people are no longer living their own lives glory it's it's tables that are better set forth one table right now is a table that's preparing people for gentlemen but there's another table where judgment is right now where we're being judged by the word where the Holy Spirit is searching out our lives what's he doing he's separating he's drawing us unto himself this is where the scripture said and that look what and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap remember as we were looking at a few weeks ago Israel God stated that right through Paul Israel had the advantage in best Paul said chiefly in every way the covenants were to them the promises were to them all of these things were written out but yet hidden within the old there was the new hidden within the Old Testament there was a bride amen and that's why Paul Paul's ministry the Spirit of God bringing that unction it would reach back in there and now begin to make make manifest and known those promises that concerned you and I but even though here we were hidden but God has now revealed his purpose and we understand that he's only turned away from the Jews his brethren for just a period of time but he's done that he was put in exile because they were envious of him but all of that was in the plan and program so that he might bring forth his Gentile bride what love what love you might feel like today no sender I've got a need in my life mentally I can't even think of a promise that fits that but let me tell you something whether you can think of a promise that fits to that know that what your need is God has already provided whether you can remember or have knowledge of that certain promise that maybe would would fit your need but yet God himself has already provided and he is the sufficiency of all that you have need of there might be things to where you say it's a new disease but he already got it covered I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases as I write this table you see this table what should have been a a welfare what should have been a place to wear that they would have been comforting and brought them into expectation like it did for Simeon and Anna and all the remnant that was living there that's the way it should have been but yet it wasn't because they're eating was not an eating of faith this was an eating of works works when even the sacrifices themselves became works so how could it not be how could it be faith and not works they still had to bring the lamb or they had to bring this offering but it's the heart it's the heart is it just works that well this is what God expects and this is what God requires us this time of the year and this is it just works are we doing it don't well if I do this and you know I believe if I start doing this I I believe God will have more favour on me I believe it can be works you see there's things that yes that we want to have prevail in our life you might want to have in your life and say you know I want a deeper I want a deeper experience I want uh you know I want I want more of God I want to give more of myself to the Lord at first listen friends it's gonna require something out of you but where it's a dying time to where that it's you giving way it's you redeeming the time but as you continue to go it's no longer it's not something that you just see is right and you're just giving yourself to but now it begins to move within your life and you find the pulsation you find out God it's just from just on giving you the strength to be able to nourish me because what it is you find listen when you find something that's good you find something that gives you nourishment you find something that tastes good tell me you don't want it again you can look at a lot of us and know we eat a lot of things but their table have become a snare what they were teaching was not building the people up in faith see in faith faith creates an expectation the Ministry of the word it ought to create an expectation in our lives sometimes we you may leave and you might you see well I don't feel any different it's not about how you feel the Word of God coming forth and us receiving that word that word has the power to bring about the transformation that is needed but everything that they did we see this they placed the veil it became a trap everything because everything was by works but they had also started to create and it had been down through time traditions you know years ago I remember when I was looking at this on traditions there the Russians pick it up and it's like where you get a group of kids in a circle and I tell you brother Enoch so then you take what I said and you tell brother Brian brother Brian takes what he says he tells brother Dave but the day takes what he says he tells brother his suits but they soothe it so it's it's not direct it's not direct it starts coming through and there's bits and pieces and there's certain things and maybe Enoch feels like if I had this little further glorified or if now this really in a major point but time it gets to Brian by the time it gets back around to the original person it's entirely different story it was no longer this kind of a man and he had this honor and whatever more the by the time it gets back they've got somebody who was a kid or maybe a woman or whatever more what is that that's the breakdown of the human mind trying to tell things I don't have a problem with recall but let me just say this that's why if that our gospel is not a recall it takes the presence of Almighty God the living Lord Jesus Christ coming down in every generation to every believer personally but you don't know something second handedly you know it by firsthand experience that he is alive and well what he was back there he still is the same he's not changed in essent or nature berries nobody can take that away from you as a rock in which you are resting upon it becomes the pulsation and the life that lives for you and you live by that and no matter what Satan tries to say the gates of Hell cannot prevail against that revelation because that's a revelation that God Himself came down personally personally and when he comes personally that lets you know who you are you're no longer taking somebody else's word for it but you're following this as an overcomer you're not part of a movement but the movers in you hallelujah yes sir tables make a difference you know the Bible said that they sought this righteousness by their own works and not by faith but that one everybody that one everybody David throughout the Psalms would say you're the God of my righteousness my righteousness is come from you lord David caride of that same righteousness that was made known and reveal to Abraham but you see there begin to come recipe variations you know some people just can't leave a recipe alone like you know my wife makes something a certain way when I'm in my house that's the way I want it please don't come and say sister Kim maybe you add a little bit of this don't do it brother Samuel notice it at the table I know I need to have better manners than to say hey what's wrong with this my wife you know she's covering it up you understand what I'm saying you have an expectation is that right you know you don't come here and expect Creed's to be served out you don't come here and expect anything less than the Living Word of God by his presence to move forth and speak to our lives we have need of him we need him to come and speak to us he knows the situations and conditions in our life and he manifests himself that he's still the same God I know people think sometimes I think people get to thinking that dog died God didn't die God still speaking not a new message but it is the message that was given and God is declaring that what was declared over this generation and God Himself is declaring to you and I personally glory be to God tradition free we don't need we don't need we don't need the message where we need to just lift it up and God already vindicated it the way we really lift up the real Word of God is our lives the Bible said I would been men everywhere we're lifting up holy hands is that right the Prophet tells us in Christ the mystery of God revealed he said hold up the hands of your pastor know right now what I was holding up it's the word we're not holding up a man come on friends we're not trying to introduce this generation to a man we're introducing to Jesus Christ he is now here in the fullness of his word [Applause] blow would be to God but man start tampering with recipes they're changing the food and just you know how it all is is well I like this flavor a little bitter I like this a little bitter I like they begin to drift its man's ideas friends we don't need man's ideas I don't want my ideas I want his I want his thoughts this scripture here I read that I read I referred to this to last time but drawn back here in numbers 4 7 in the tabernacle there was a place in the tabernacle there's a table that was placed there in thee in the Holy not the holiest but the holy place it's called the table of shewbread they were to spread a cloth of blue and put their own dishes and spoons and bowls and what was needed and this shewbread this this word that's used is the word pan IAM which is his face his presence his person remember when moses was standing there in exodus 33 and then in Exodus 34 Moses asked to see him he said you no man can see my face it wasn't face time yet you who isn't me it wasn't face time yet face time was gonna come but he said as he begin to make himself known Moses said Lord don't carry us up any further if your presence is not going with us now we understand what happened when it came that the ten spies came back over and said were not able to do it that all of a sudden that the people you know we understand the things that begin to take place in the camp but we read of how the next day that they took it upon themselves to try to move in and say well we're gonna go up and we're going we're gonna smite them right now but you see even though you can look at it and say man that seems like that would that's right on a promise of God but it wasn't in the time we see what time there was they rejected him who is the one that fights the battles it was not now it was him it was not their strength that would open with my battle but because they rejected the bread of his presence they went on their own strength and when they went on their own strength Moses told him don't go up because What did he say God's not with you it shows us that it is we we want to say God help me to be in a place to move when you're calling us to move you see what it is it's moving us away from what we want you see the word comes it doesn't come to make us comfortable but it comes to pull us beyond our comfort zone the real comfort zone is us it's us certain things that we like certain things we feel one but here God comes down and he deals with us to call us beyond our comfort zone I'm telling you every one of us we need to be called beyond our comfort zone every one of us the moment that we think we're fine you're too comfortable you're too comfortable God doesn't want the people of Zion settling down and where we're just looking you know no the reality there's a rest but it's a rest and expectation when that little woman would she knew that there was a promise of the owner the owner's son was going to come to the ranch she didn't set out she made ready she was up busying herself but it was she was not doing it by works but grace itself was expressed divine grace that had been given now her works were demonstrate appreciation for grace that had come our way she was washing she was cleaning up she was scrubbing down she was enduring all the persecution all the reproach why a promise that had been made she wasn't sitting around we're not in autopilot mode no sir you see all these watch how things are spoken when when the Prophet kids talk about the things or the stabilizers are put on the ship that doesn't mean that we all of a sudden kick back and cross our feet oh that's a praise the Lord it's just it's all it's yes that song it's already done it's already done the battle is over it's already done I agree with that but it doesn't mean for us to just kick back the bride has made herself ready moving moving this is why the Prophet could say listen friends the Prophet never looked at this message and said oh they can never denominated he never thought that way as a matter of fact he thought contrary he stood right in his own pulpit there in the Hebrew series and he said God oh who know it's hard to tell what kind of spirit will wind its way in bran of tabernacle some day that's what he said then he goes on to tell us in God's chosen place of worship they're dying Lamb of God may the people who follow this message never stand still for a denomination the key word is not denomination but key phrases stand still there's an element that we do need to stand still but then there's also a time where we've got to be moving we need to be standing still enough for the word to be able to address us and clothe us and work with our life but in order for that to be it's also going to take us surrendering our lives and letting God guide our hands into the sleeves I don't want to stand in steel Coast and and steel stagnation that's a sister we want this is a living water to us this is a fountain open in the house of David this is returning to the true atonement the real true cleansing the bread of his presence oh my notice how Jesus when he would refer to this the bread of his presence the bread of his face he said I am that true bread that my father has sent down from heaven he was the bread of the very presence of Almighty God want you to look at this how that David himself David was a feeder on the word you believe that David was not a quoter he was a feeder it was not a poster he was a feeder he was not a blogger he was a feeder hello somebody what's how David and it's just a few examples watch how David himself more to me design he's talking about the law more to be desired are they than gold yay they must find gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb my David he shouted about the law sometimes we come into service and it's just like listen friends I'm not here shaming anybody but I'm saying what what God has done for us understand that this it's what the enemy wants to take from you it ought to be your worship it ought to be our delight a man who is planted in the Lord the Bible says his delight is in the law of the Lord it is love does he meditate day and night meditation comes from what you're immersing yourself in what you're thinking on what you're dwelling on what you're meditating on comes from what you immerse him look what David says the Psalms 34 verse 8 o taste and see that the Lord is good I've never been something where you look at something you think some of you look and say I never met nothing I didn't want to eat every one time I was growing up I need to have this beef stroganoff oh I couldn't stand how that stuff looked but one day brother Dominic I tried it mmm one of them football banquets I had to be at who I tried it that was it that was it I said man the looks was hiding something awful good he'd become one of those comfort foods that you think about in this time of the year you know when it's cold that well we won't go on that but I tasted it but you see I had to first taste it I didn't get a big lot on my plate I put just a little bit but when I had that little bit I hate it oh that was it I was back up in line I found something that was good and when I found what was good I was no longer tasting it I became a feeder on it tasting it will never suffice tasting it you can say I like it now it needs a little bit more of this or a little more but when you just feel a taste of the Lord just taste of it but something do I got to know just taste of him what mother said I got this in my life just taste of him but said I need the Holy Ghost just taste of him just taste and then what see that the Lord is good what we have need of is in him Fred you can't get the Holy Ghost outside the word the Holy Ghost fallen there he on the day of Pentecost what did he come he came according to the season and fulfillment of the word he said I'll send the promise the father will send the promise of the Spirit in my name the right he preached the word and when he preached the word and brought conviction it drew them they work tasting of the Lord and as they would feed upon that word what were they doing what must we do what have been doing hey we tasted it what must we do so here Peter is he starts serving up the prophesies that's been fulfilled you see it's a table now what was once stored up what was once stored up was no longer just stored up cans and vegetables but now not Peter but the Spirit of God had made that promise an actual sustance for that moment and here's Peter serving it up he's serving it Peter didn't cook it Peter didn't make it all Peter did we'll serve it the understand what I'm talking about remember when there was some that actually had a problem with brother Neville serving food in the tabernacle wooziness spirit but what do one do it and say he what was he serving he was not the originator of it he was only preaching that message that God had already brought it wasn't on a cart it wasn't on machinery come on somebody these are not my words these are the words of the messenger is that right God does not use machinery that's not God's way that's not his pattern God uses the agency of man yes he does he still does that because this is an apostolic gospel it's the same gospel that was given in the beginning and he's still the same yesterday today and forever do we thank God for the tapes and books absolutely I immersed myself in it it's the message of the hour but it does not override the pattern of what was given the messenger himself being a true messenger held true to the true pattern glory be to God oh ma notice where David are going to say he said I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord how sweet are thy words unto my taste the rest of it was just machine it was just I do this we do that Moses said do this we do this we do that we do this not a finger then put a finger on their life but it was out without feeling there was no heart in it like Paul Raider when he walked out of the house remember that he walked out of the house and he got the thinking the brem says he got the thinking Paul Raider said my heart started beating bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger and I got the thinking you know my wife what a sheet there when I get back Lord what would happen to her so he runs back in throws open the door kisses her this time it ain't a pet it maybe had a little bit of butter he said what was the difference the second one had feeling in it the first one was formality the second one had feeling see God doesn't want our formality he wants feeling God's designed maybe the son little sing the same song twenty five minutes straight oh lord have mercy maybe he'll sing at twenty five minutes straight but you see it ain't about the song he might sing the slow song in the world are you with me it ain't about how fast the songs are sometimes songs gonna be so fast and people get worked right up in such a fast but then when the word comes for this you're missing it you're missing what that song was all about nothing wrong with fast songs nothing wrong with slow songs either you could sing it is well with my soul the power of God just moved right down we don't have to work nothing up all we have to do is surrender brother BAM till desist this over and over and over worship is spontaneous is that right it should be spontaneous he also said are you familiar with a quote he said give me one man one man surrendered to God God will do more with that one man in 10,000 what if everybody says Lord when I'm coming into church today I am gonna be your surrendered vessel lord have mercy what will take place is that right oh mama may get a place here david said in psalms 23:5 i'm i'm getting ready to come down here we'll just find a place they'll prepare us a table before me in the presence of mine enemies now you and I both know if you're if an enemy's around you're not thinking about a picnic lunch like this you know I say Enoch you tell me what's over my back and I look behind you and so I'm doing like this this is food but look at this thou my shepherd my lord prepare us me he's got your name card right on this place this place has been reserved for you could only be to God and you received an invitation he's prepared this table in the presence of mine enemies oh well not only not only are we talking about Satan and all his aunt's but we're also talking about an enemy who's closer than that our own selves I'm feeding look think of this you and me are feeding on this word our souls are being benefited our spirits are being benefited and even our body our flesh because our flesh and our spirit is very quick to side with the enemy all right but it's benefiting from us feeding on the word as we're feeding on the promises I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases what's happening is we're taking that in as a son and daughter of God and we're believing that what is it doing it's putting an order into our life the pulsation of the Holy Spirit that's coming through that word his words are spirit in life what's it doing it's putting in order into our body our body is benefiting from this you believe that it's benefiting my mind benefits from it my spirit benefits from it sometimes where our spirit gets all gloomy and out of sorts come on friends message a perfect faith right at the beginning brother Graham says I get moody too I get them same kind of spells right what did they sell he tells us if we can look at it he says it's when I get overworked and he said when I get overworked he said then Satan comes telling me nobody loves you see nobody cares about you you see them people then people don't want nothing to do with you then people he said but then I look out and I see people who have drove from such a long ways away he said and I put it right back in his face you see you've got to take what God is putting right there it wasn't a chapter it wasn't a quote but he put forth what the enemy was trying to tell him nobody cares for him he put it right back and said they care about me they love this word you tell me expressions of love don't mean something you tell me expressions of win you have on your heart to call somebody or I'll stop by or send them a card or Cinematheque you tell me that don't mean something when God puts that aren't you on your heart that's one of the gifts working in the body you need to be obedient to that they'll prepare us a table before me in the presence of the enemies of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over you see brother Branham he says this let me read this quote to you God hath provided way can I read this let me think you brought gonna read it anyhow but at least wants you to be open to it God hid in sundry times he wanted his children to have the best so he made the preparations he foreshadowed it through the prophets he revealed it in Christ and the table set today and every man and woman that's invited has a welcome to come to this table for he was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes we were healed it's all foreseen it's provided and prepared the meals ready but Col is given he foresaw it he made preparations it's God's provided way for you when your souls are hungry your souls hungry you get a little soul brown or some soul food [Laughter] glory be to God and the only way you can have soul food you need fire we better go on a lady look said he said a lady said to me just this morning she said I walked into one of those meetings I seen the people so happy said I wasn't happy and then I looked at him and I said surely they had something I wished I had that but I wonder how people look at us the happy don't mean we're bubble dancing but there's a part of happy your countenance our countenance and there's an atmosphere listen friends the things that we think on and we feed on creates an atmosphere around us the Prophet gave those examples in spiritual food and due season he talks about in the supernatural where Elijah feeding on that word he said Elijah was living up in a different atmosphere he spoke about the prophets in spiritual food in due season he said how that they themselves so lived in that word wrap themselves in that word till they in the word became the same thing where they could speak things that was not according to their thinking and beyond their own understanding that's real Liberty what liberated Elijah what a liberator what Liberator Jonah what liberated your mind what liberated eyes a you say all go to Samuel they were special men but remember they still had to surrender and will come down on this point they still had to surrender God didn't just come down and forcibly take them over when the Prophet you remember how the Prophet stands a Jeff talks about the maniac of getting of Ganner are not in Oregon right read some parts of the message brother remember say I wasn't afraid read another parcel message brother himself was afraid but say no one man aren't you bothered by that the man was not infallible God is infallible he's been waiting but there's a part of him that wasn't fear and there's a part that wasn't inferior come on somebody there's a plaque that was afraid there's a part that wasn't afraid but the Prophet said he began to get thoughts concerning that man remember some star to size him up a gospel preacher starting to size him up see God didn't do it for him God didn't do it for him but he said I started thinking this poor man no doubt got his husband got home family he began to change his thoughts but Graham does say that he said I chose to think differently he ordered he ordered his thoughts around and what happened when he ordered his thoughts around then the Holy Spirit could step down and take on the challenge but God did not do it for the profit but the profit began to move into that place friends I wonder I wonder if some of the perplexing things about our life is not because his big is because then we don't choose to order our thoughts differently well we can say Lord let the meditation of my heart and the words of my mouth be acceptable in your sight the Friends of God came down and took control that situation see the presence of God look how sweet the Holy Spirit is he won't demand it of us that he comes to bring us into a place of surrender let me finish this this lady how she was saying you know I was these people are so happy brother man said sure the table was set for that poor hungry soul and before the service was over she was eating from the same table she tasted good whew this is good I need some oh she was eating no longer just tasting eating so our brother Graham can tell us hearing recognizing a new day and his message he said right there in your seats God can transform your life you can promise he said to turn over all kinds of leaves he said that when the fire of God will issue forth he said it'll bring a change right there it will not be a turning over of a new leaf but he will bring a change right there the word bringing a change glory be to God feeding ourselves right into the promise of God glory be to God hallelujah oh my a lady from the audience says brother Branham that was me that's that's it's right that same lady says and now I'm happy today when I read the next paragraph you'll know who he's talking about drunken wall-eyed drunk alcoholic to the limits the doctors had give her up here she is happy and rejoicing Rosella Griffith she ate while the word was coming forth she started eating on the word there would be no God and that's been about two years ago I guess three years ago and look it's still holding out Rosella Griffin just did not get an anointing on her flesh she just does not get a movement of a mana upon her spirit but that mana fell down into the holiest of holy and she became a feeder on the word you say what are you talking about you can't feed on anointing you feed on the word a man might be anointed and move all over the place but a man could stand right here and under the same anointing of the Holy Ghost and maybe wouldn't raise his voice at all but the word is coming forth and we're feeding on that word if you ever come to that table once and set your feet under it this ain't no cocktail party this ain't no meet-and-greet you ever come to this table you pull off the chair you sit down yeah this is my name on it I mean hallelujah that means I've got a place at the table I already have a portion for me I can begin to eat and feast on this word on Christ taking him into my life as a feeder as a feeder a feeder listen to me friends testimonies are wonderful but you've got to be a feeder on the word send me one brother Brandon went up here brother Ram did all that those are all wonderful those are things that God would allow you and I to know that he's still the same God and God wants to be that real to you and I but if all you know is the testimonies you're not a feeder you need to be a feeder because a feeder itself requires you to surrender and as you begin to feed what you're doing is you're taking in the nutrients of the word notice I mean I can explain super serpents II you might be able to do that but that don't mean you're a feeder I can explain baptism that don't mean you're a feeder you see this is not about doctrines and the accumulation of knowledge this is feeding on him it's his life taking his life within us this is what we read in the opening scripture to kind of set this groundwork here this morning it's feeding on his life on him jesus said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you is there right this feeding it's like in the natural if you or me in the natural we stopped feeding what happens eventually our body starts turning on us that right things start actually taking place and they're setting in and are in our in our bodies and in our lives our immune system starts breaking down because our body even though you might eat that hamburger or that steak but the way that everything is broke down in the stomach and then from the stomach all of that how it's all process brought back in through the blood all of those things its nutrients that's in there my cells on my skin or on my head or wherever more or in my liver it's the same way it is with you they're not time thinking about hey Samuel I would like a hamburger today no its nutrients they're calling for nutrients sometimes you know how it is if you're forgettin and sometimes you know you forget to eat and and hours have gone by and you find yourself maybe you should go getting low in you you find things you don't happen to me you got a headache and you think oh my goodness I ain't even ate today or what am or what is it it's your body giving signs to let you know hey I need nourishment but you see I just can't take a hamburger and go boom right there into the heart know I've got to eat it first now when I eat it my beef sells out here are the cells in my legs or or whatever more they may not get the the experience right been in there but if I'm taking and I'm feeding on that I have a confidence in the process of those things that are put in the body it'll be able to break it down and get it to where it needs to go I'm glad that God is not lifted up to you and I had to say uh you you tell me where to put the word this morning Brian you tell me where to put the word this morning Shane you tell me where to put the word this morning Joey you tell me where to do that know what we have to do is surrender to Him he'll see to it that the word itself gets to the area of our life he'll address that area and then if we'll feed on that word and take that word into our life right within our life the very spiritual gastronomic of the Holy Ghost will begin to cook that lamb roast that lamb begin to break it down in our life to so much so to where it can actually make its way into the tiniest smallest cells and we can be benefited in our lives right now this morning right now this morning you can be benefiting right now this morning from maybe what more has been taking place from last week the word itself is just as you let it go throughout the week you're just meditating on it you're just thinking God for it but saying I don't feel nothing yet no we're not told my feeling anything we're talking about praising him when the word is went forth as a seed it's just like when I've eaten that hamburger or eating that grilled cheese I can begin to say thank you my cells can say it's on the way it's on the way I already know he's put it down there down his pipe it's coming it's on the way nutrients are coming you and I can begin to water with praise thank you Lord Jesus thank you for your word this morning thank you Lord God for your presence in my life you get up tomorrow tomorrow it might seem like all clouds are around you but you can say thank you lord why because your faith has not been placed in the enticing words of man's wisdom your faith is resting in the power of Almighty God and what God Himself is sowed into your heart and you've taken that innocent thank you lord God baby took one one scripture for scriptures maybe a part of a quote and God took that little lads lunch but out of that little lads lunch he multiplied it and brought it right down to this day right here February 25th 2018 and what does it become a light unto my feet my pathway is illuminated by his presence you see our feeding it affects everything in our life you find yourself where you find you'd seem like you don't have strength it seems like the temptations and things is getting hard check your feeding check what's your feeding check your feeding and your prayer life remember if you listen if you starve the white dog you're only feeding the black one you starve the white dog how do you start the white dog by feeding the black dog so the thing that you want to do is starve the black dog how do I starve the black dog my feeding the white dog it's very simple who you feed is who you say has dominance motive being a god so what is it our feeding it's our overcoming the Prophet said keep life in you taking that word in feeding on it let's have me there's a situation or there's something in my life feed on that word friends pray I got to looking at some of the things too this week had been staying on some things on wounds and things like that and I got to looking at different things and you know that even your diet when you've got a wound can affect the healing I got to looking at that I got to looking at how there's things are myths where people have always believed certain things about healing the wound and they were tell me you know you always pour it full of hydrogen peroxide man I hated that stuff when I was little I never want to get a cut but they start talking about how that those things actually harm the cells they said but there's a natural alkalinity that is a part of your body with the Seleka saline solution to where if you actually take the wound and rinse with what is already your body is used to you don't end up destroying cells but it actually ends up being promoting healing sooner but sometimes there's things get stuck in those wounds you with me I remember when I cut it was this thumb right here when I was I cut that when I was in school the first year of college I cut that hole it's called called a tendon or ligament on what that's called but you popping up through there when I went to the hospital and boys I said when I did it I never had stitches in my life but I did it and the guy said browning come on you get in the van he said I said no there's coastal football practice I said I'll just put something on it it'll heal up he said browning that ain't gonna heal that way that's a wound I know I said I just brought back it real good I'll bet you two get in a van I didn't know I was in shock at the time that's what hurt us but I get there and you know what before when I had they had to say let me see it I had to pull this stuff off of it it's hard sometimes when you got to look at things but you know what they wanted to make sure before they sealed it up they wanted to make sure that I didn't have fragments from what I had been cutting sometimes picking them fragment sounds like when they had to they were looking in there you know pushing it around and doing with the tweezer Oh but they were able to make sure that the wound was clear once they got it clear they could sew it up and it could heal they didn't ask me what kind of knife you use they didn't ask me what kind of entertainment center was that or whatever it was that I was working on the shelf then it asked me they did not even talk about that you know where their focus was the wound aren't you glad that God knows where to focus this word friends as we feed on this word it has the power and the potential to heal in our lives maybe even areas of our life we're not even aware but God knows and he'll see to it that that pulsation it'll take those nutrients and it'll bring it right to where it needs to be what I need to do just feed just feed just feed just fede fede fede fede fede as you're feeding you're giving yourself to him so how many times the brother brand of my brother brand will talk about the different parts and he'll say he said he said you say aye brother branham I want the Holy Ghost he said feed on the word you see the feeding on the world what's it doing is conditioning it may not happen right at that moment or right but what's it doing it's bringing us into that place it's feeding on that word what's your loving this morning Lord I want to feed I want to feed I want to feed I know he'll see to it it gets to where it needs to get to I'm confident of that he's supplying what we need out of the promise in this hour to strengthen us one of these days one of these moments where the dominant could be the final quickening it might be when you're getting ready for work they when the kids are getting ready for school or man you're thinking man I got this I got this midterm exam and all of a sudden but you won't be shouting because you're going to take a midterm you'll be Sheldon because I made it I'm stand-in here Gord thank you thank you Lord for your strength thank you Lord for your deliverance Oh glory be to God you love him this morning I surrender all to You Lord I give myself Lord giving myself to you Lord tasting of the Lord seeing these good feeding on that word feeding on that word you find yourself battling with things find yourself maybe in your mind or what feed on the word look back and say what's my what's my diet been like this week what's my diet been like this month what's it been like what's my prayer time just evaluated he's not here to put you down but just evaluate it because to know that God himself meets you and his desire is to sell father or Jesus we surrendered Lord our hearts to you this morning Lord I'm it's not just Lord of myself as a speaker but this congregation father we're looking to you because Lord our confidence as you have spoke to us then Lord there's times we don't know we don't know Lord that why maybe our body responds in a certain way in the natural we don't know what it is what's lacking the Lord I think of how that the prophet used the simple example of natural cases and even applied there in the scripture where David would speak about the longing within his heart Lord a deep calleth unto the deep at the noise of that waterspouts probably talked about how that by example brought some of those little boys I think one of them Lord how they would eat the the petals off a bicycle that seems to us we think my goodness who in the world could do that but it wasn't the pedal it was a craving that he had within him for a certain substance Lord to me it's a paradox at his body that that direction would have been it would have been known that that's what he needed in his body Lord I believe that you know just what we need I believe that Lord I believe that God but even now as we're sitting here in the house of God but I believe Lord when we are there in our devotions of a morning and father in the evening and throughout the day Lord God when we're listening Lord to the message when we're reading in the scripture I believe that Lord I believe Lord God but we you know just what we have needeth North to see how that you'll drop little nuggets along our way sometimes Lord when we're listening or we're reading or we're praying sometimes Lord it seems like that it seems like I don't seem like I'm understanding everything it seems like my mind is going and going and going but Lord we realize Lord that is we're feeding on that word sometimes the Lord God we don't understand we do not know Lord where that word and how that it's going and moving in our life but I believe with all my heart if we're truly just feeding on it Lord God I'd be Lord God that you will bring it to pass Lord and make it known in our lives you give to us just what we have need of Lord Father how I thank you so much Lord God thank you Father Lord for your word thank you for your leading Lord thank you Lord God for the Holy Ghost Lord thank you Lord God Oh Lord Jesus that you've lifted up Lord your word out of the pages Lord God of the scripture Lord it's substance Lord it's it's a sustenance to our life Lord we're living Lord God not by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Lord to see how your prophet would place that Lord I love it he spent said Lord concerning that of the eagle the eagle is one who feeds its eaglets by its mouth and it's you Lord God you the great Papa Eagle Lord feeding us as your children Lord your eaglets your feeding us Lord by your mouth Lord you are placing Lord God that meat Lord God right into our mouths Lord God may you find mouths that are open Lord hearts that are open as it were Lord for Lord Jesus we need you Lord God I pray that father that you'll just give strength equipping each and every one Lord may be here today Lord God there's one that doesn't know you Lord God maybe they don't know you in the depth lord of the experience that has been ministered in the presence that they felt this morning Lord but I pray father that they will surrender Lord father Lord to that to you Lord to you're working Lord - you're moving upon their life and say Lord I want that Lord like that woman she's seen her God that there was a real happiness Lord and so when she saw that Lord she sat underneath she pulled up to the table sat down and begin to eat Lord God I pray this morning Lord may each and every one of us Lord no matter what the need is within the life Lord may we eat Lord God of the promised word of Almighty God may we feed upon this word Lord God granted Lord Jesus I pray father we love you Lord we thank you Lord God help us Lord God in our daily walk Lord Father if there's any that's tripped Lord any Lord God that would be out of fellowship Lord I pray this morning Lord just by the simplicity Lord of their heart Lord being turned and open to you and say Lord restore me Lord God Lord restore me Lord that fellowship Lord God restore Lord God forgive me Lord for allowing the things of this life in this world more to get in the way Lord God but I want to be a feeder on this word granite Lord Jesus may it be when each one looks and each of us looks at our life may it be Lord God that what we find what is the principal source of our feed may it be you Lord God to a lot of other good things Lord the things that could be around us but Lord there's one principal source that we have need of and that's your God help us Lord help those the Lord that maybe when they're looking in Lord at faith is Lord in the word and they say they feel like well I don't understand this but may they put their confidence not in their intellectual ability but may they put their confidence in you Lord that you Lord God will reveal to them Lord God this word granite Lord Jesus I pray we love you and we thank
