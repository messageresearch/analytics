[40:25] when i preach anyway
[40:27] so we might just get into the word amen

[40:31] and the word is not just a dead letter
[40:32] to us it comes with power the kingdom of
[40:35] god is not in word only
[40:36] but in power if you have your bibles
[40:38] we're going to be looking into
[40:40] uh i don't know where i'm looking into
[40:43] st john the second chapter
[40:44] i had a book marked i opened to it i'm
[40:46] like is this the right place i'm
[40:48] looking at the wrong page it's not a
[40:50] very good excuse is it saint john

[40:54] look here in a couple different
[40:55] scriptures

[41:25] they're being caught up by revelation
[41:27] into heavenly places even today
[41:29] under the sounding of the voice of god
[41:31] lord we believe this same word which we
[41:33] have heard which we've believed
[41:35] will one day quicken these bodies lord
[41:37] it's already bringing them subjects to
[41:39] the word
[41:40] by your holy spirit and lord we just ask
[41:43] now we invite you to come
[41:45] and minister in a special way lord help
[41:46] me as a man to move out of the way
[41:49] father because i
[41:50] i am i am keenly aware even now that i
[41:53] am unable
[41:54] to meet the needs and the desires that
[41:56] you have for these people
[41:57] but i just ask oh god you take my lips
[42:00] like you did the prophet isaiah
[42:02] lord allow me to speak to this people
[42:03] may you purge us with a coal and with
[42:05] fire lord that
[42:06] we could say what you'd have us to say
[42:08] lord that we could present ourselves not
[42:10] just me as a minister today
[42:12] but each one of us can lift our hands
[42:14] and present ourselves like that prophet
[42:16] and say here am i oh lord send me lord
[42:18] wherever you'd have me to go to my to my
[42:20] church to my home to my family
[42:22] whatever you would have for me lord hear

[42:27] a living sacrifice to you which is my
[42:30] reasonable service
[42:31] lord have your way in my life here am i
[42:33] oh god send me lord i'm willing to go if
[42:36] you'll send me o god
[42:37] i'm willing to go wherever you go with
[42:39] me father lord i believe today just come
[42:41] and
[42:42] bless the word in a mighty way may come
[42:44] and speak that which is needful father
[42:46] not that which we desire after our own
[42:48] flesh lord so many times in my life i
[42:50] i had a desire and an ambition within
[42:53] myself
[42:54] but lord your spirit come and you took
[42:56] those things out of me lord that warned
[42:57] of you lord my desire
[42:59] my ambition today is just to be a
[43:01] prisoner
[43:02] to the word and will of jesus christ
[43:05] lord make that the chiefest desire in
[43:07] each of our
[43:08] hearts today we pray we commit this
[43:10] service now
[43:11] our lives our souls into your loving
[43:13] hands as a faithful creator
[43:15] we ask these things in the mighty name
[43:17] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[43:19] and the church says amen saint john the
[43:23] second chapter let's read verses 13
[43:25] to 17 here and uh
[43:29] we'll just start here let's see verse
[43:30] 13. amen
[43:32] and then like i said we'll also go over
[43:33] to the 69th psalm here in just a moment
[43:36] saint john 2 13 says in the jews
[43:38] passover was at hand
[43:40] and jesus went up to jerusalem and found
[43:43] in the temple those that sold oxen and
[43:46] sheep
[43:47] and dubs and the changes of money
[43:50] sitting
[43:50] and when he had made a scourge of small
[43:52] cords he drove
[43:54] them all out of the temple and the sheep
[43:58] and the ox and poured over the changers
[44:00] money and over through the tables
[44:02] and he said unto them that salt doves
[44:05] take
[44:05] these things hence make not my father's
[44:09] house
[44:10] and house of merchandise
[44:13] and the 17th verse is why we're going to
[44:15] turn another place in a second
[44:16] it says and his disciples remembered
[44:19] that it was written
[44:21] the zeal of thine house has eaten me up
[44:24] amen if you turn me to the 69th psalm
[44:27] we're going to look there this morning
[44:29] as well at the scripture that they were
[44:31] reminded of
[44:32] and then i'll have you be seated here
[44:34] psalm 69 we'll start in verse 6 and read
[44:36] down to verse 9
[44:37] and this is the psalm of david he says
[44:39] let not them that wait on thee
[44:42] oh lord god of hosts be ashamed for my
[44:44] sake
[44:45] let not those that seek thee be
[44:47] confounded for my sake o god of israel
[44:49] because for thy sake i have borne
[44:53] reproach shame hath covered my face
[44:57] i am become a stranger unto my brethren
[45:01] notice who he's a stranger to amen and
[45:03] an alien until my mother's
[45:05] children why for the zeal of thine
[45:08] house hath eat me up and the reproaches
[45:10] of them that reproach
[45:11] thee are fallen upon
[45:14] me may the lord bless the reading which
[45:16] words are seated
[45:18] i told myself i was gonna try and keep
[45:19] my jacket on a little bit today and be
[45:21] prim and proper and
[45:22] i've already decided that was a tactical
[45:24] error so we're done
[45:26] amen i want to speak about this thought
[45:28] this morning and into this afternoon
[45:30] the zeal of this house amen and i think
[45:33] it's very interesting we uh
[45:35] we're all familiar with this scripture
[45:36] of course jesus in the temple
[45:39] and the money changers and him going in
[45:40] and actually if you look at the
[45:41] timetable of it in the scriptures i
[45:43] believe it happens twice
[45:44] once at the beginning of his ministry
[45:46] and once near the very end of his
[45:48] ministry
[45:48] and it's interesting like i said you
[45:50] look at this and it's a very
[45:52] portrait of a religious gathering amen
[45:55] because we understand that satan he is
[45:57] not a creator
[45:58] amen and don't ever let him tell you
[46:00] that he is a creator
[46:02] sometimes he'll try to convince you that
[46:03] he's just you know he's got things a
[46:05] certain way and he's engineered satan's
[46:07] eden
[46:07] to where nobody can make it out but
[46:09] listen he's doing the same thing he's
[46:10] done for thousands of years
[46:12] because he can't do anything different i
[46:14] mean he has no new strategy his
[46:16] strategies
[46:17] unbelief to get you to walk away from
[46:19] the word of god just like he did back at
[46:21] the beginning
[46:22] he's got the same strategy today and god
[46:24] has got the same strategy
[46:26] if you believe my word and you receive
[46:28] my word you will live
[46:30] amen it's just that simple and then we
[46:33] try to complicate it sometimes we
[46:34] try to make it about the gathering or
[46:36] this or that but i want to encourage you
[46:38] today wherever you're at
[46:39] if you believe this message and you
[46:41] believe this word of god and you're
[46:42] holding fast to it it's holding fast to
[46:44] you
[46:44] you have no reason to fear today no
[46:47] matter what diseases rise up no matter
[46:49] what happens to the dollar in the
[46:50] economy or everything else
[46:52] we have a place a resting place today
[46:54] amen
[46:55] we're not shaken with the world we find
[46:57] a place of rest hallelujah
[46:59] we have received a kingdom which cannot
[47:02] be moved
[47:04] and don't ever let the devil tell you
[47:05] otherwise he's the one that's got a
[47:07] reason to be shook
[47:08] up listen that's why he's doing what
[47:10] he's doing today
[47:11] he knows he's got a short time he won't
[47:14] tell you that but the bible has
[47:15] testified
[47:16] his days are numbered but for you and i
[47:19] our time we're just rising up our
[47:21] moments just begun amen
[47:24] we look at the religious world today and
[47:26] it's a very portrait just like here in
[47:28] the scripture
[47:28] it's a religious gathering amen satan is
[47:31] just trying to imitate the plan of god
[47:33] he's got nothing to claim the
[47:35] originality amen
[47:36] he looks at the works of god and he
[47:38] wants to imitate it and that's all he
[47:39] can do amen
[47:40] you've got a group of people here and
[47:41] they are observing in the scripture that
[47:43] we read they're observing
[47:44] the passover amen now all these
[47:47] pharisees
[47:48] and these scribes and these jews they're
[47:50] observing the passover and yet the
[47:52] passover himself is right there
[47:54] and they missed it amen praise the lord
[47:58] they were going about their business
[48:00] their business in the in the house of
[48:02] god
[48:02] but yet jesus was about his father's
[48:04] business
[48:06] amen so they're all doing the same thing
[48:08] they're just doing it for two different
[48:09] kinds of masters
[48:10] amen here's a group of people and the
[48:12] bible testified they were
[48:14] zealous for their traditions they were
[48:16] zealous for their religions but jesus
[48:18] was jealous that day too
[48:20] when she just walked in there and he saw
[48:22] the corruption
[48:23] and the pollution of it the zeal this
[48:25] house began to eat him up
[48:27] to where he he took this scourge and he
[48:29] fashioned this and he drove it out of
[48:31] the house amen
[48:33] that's the very same thing today and
[48:34] brother man talks about this he says
[48:36] this
[48:36] in the manifestation of the spirit he
[48:38] says the same people that believed in
[48:40] god i want you to really think about
[48:41] this for a moment now
[48:42] they believed in god and were zealous of
[48:45] god killed jesus
[48:48] amen paul would testify later years
[48:50] later what would he testify
[48:52] they were zealous but not after
[48:54] knowledge amen they were zealous after
[48:56] their own righteousness
[48:58] being ignorant of god's righteousness
[49:00] they would not submit to god
[49:02] and so it is the book of galatians tells
[49:05] us in the fourth chapter
[49:06] that the natural always persecutes the
[49:08] spiritual
[49:09] it's always been that way and brothers
[49:11] and sisters let me just say it's always
[49:13] going to be that way
[49:14] until we leave here so if you're
[49:16] uncomfortable with it now
[49:17] you better buckle in amen because people
[49:20] aren't just gonna love you
[49:21] tomorrow they're gonna say all the
[49:23] message people they're just such a
[49:24] blessing they're just such a wonderful
[49:25] group of people
[49:26] we just love them if you're hated today
[49:28] for his sake i'm not talking about
[49:30] because you did somebody dirty in a deal
[49:31] somewhere
[49:32] i'm not talking because you won't do
[49:33] your job at work if you're hated for his
[49:35] sake today
[49:36] you're going to be hated for his sake
[49:38] tomorrow you're going to be hated next
[49:39] week
[49:40] you're always going to be hated for his
[49:41] sake okay man
[49:43] but you and i we can rejoice let them
[49:45] disciples
[49:46] when they were cast in prison when they
[49:48] were beat up and they walked out and the
[49:50] pharisees said we can't hold them in
[49:51] what we got to let them go
[49:52] but don't you preach in that name
[49:54] anymore they walk that knot with their
[49:56] heads hung low they didn't walk out
[49:58] defeated well praise god i don't know
[50:00] what we're gonna do
[50:01] we're just being so persecuted nobody
[50:03] likes us they walked that rejoicing
[50:06] but they were accounted worthy to suffer
[50:09] for his name and say hey man
[50:11] they were mad like david said they were
[50:13] estranging their own brethren
[50:15] the very people that should have
[50:16] received them jesus in the temple the
[50:18] very passover
[50:20] doing the father's business the very
[50:22] ones that should have received them
[50:24] were the very ones that rejected them
[50:27] they're the most holy city they're the
[50:30] most holy people
[50:32] crucified the most horrible death him
[50:35] the most holy one man
[50:40] it's one thing when you get a you know
[50:42] you look at the newspaper you look over
[50:43] all these people they're persecuting the
[50:45] church when's your own brother in doing
[50:46] it
[50:47] what's your own people doing that's
[50:48] where it hurts hey man
[50:50] hallelujah my my brother
[50:53] says this in the seven church age book
[50:55] and the latest in church agent says this
[50:57] it says now this false church has a zeal
[51:01] amen make no mistake about it
[51:05] amen well man they're just so zealous
[51:06] yeah what are the zealous for the jews
[51:08] were zealous too
[51:10] oh praise the lord i hope i'm not
[51:11] talking about you all now you can get
[51:13] excited about this i'm not talking about
[51:14] yourself
[51:15] but the false church has a zeal too he
[51:17] says this
[51:18] it is her zeal has literally been that
[51:20] of the jews
[51:21] john 2 17 the zeal of thine house has
[51:24] eaten up
[51:25] but it is a wrong zeal it is for the
[51:28] house of their own
[51:29] building it is for their own creeds
[51:33] dogmas organizations their own
[51:36] righteousness
[51:37] they have put out he says they have put
[51:39] the word out
[51:40] for their own ideas they deposed
[51:44] the holy ghost and made men leaders now
[51:46] there's been a lot of talk about
[51:47] insurrection lately amen
[51:49] and we put this in the news and the
[51:51] insurrection washington this and that
[51:53] you can think what you want either way
[51:54] but what i'm saying is this what is
[51:56] insurrection
[51:57] it's not that they politely ask jesus
[51:59] and then they deposed him the holy ghost
[52:01] amen
[52:02] the bible says they deposed the holy
[52:04] ghost in other words they didn't ask him
[52:05] politely hey
[52:06] can you not come back to him on the
[52:07] midweek service this is the last service
[52:09] we want you around

[52:12] voted about it and we just uh we just
[52:14] don't really

[52:17] like to kindly ask you
[52:19] if you just kind of quit showing up to
[52:20] church no it says they deposed
[52:22] the holy ghost amen they took up arms
[52:25] and they run him out by
[52:27] force out of his own church of his own
[52:29] workmanship
[52:30] on his own building they run him out
[52:32] with violets
[52:34] they shoved him out and now he's on the
[52:36] outside of the ladder to see in church
[52:38] knocking on the door trying to get back
[52:41] in

[52:55] be welcome here we're not trying to run
[52:57] him out we're trying to run into him

[57:13] the wrong reasons
[57:14] amen well you you can know that two plus
[57:16] two is four and misuse that amen

[57:23] don't wanna argue with people and be
[57:24] right about what i think and write about

[57:53] hallelujah
[57:54] if anybody here's my voice let him open
[57:55] the door and i'll come in
[57:57] that's striking to me because he says

[58:01] voice something where did he speak
[58:03] i thought he was knocking he didn't say
[58:05] hello in there like he's knocking so
[58:06] where'd he speak

[59:15] he might have pushed him out of the
[59:16] church he might have pushed him on a
[59:17] man's ideas but don't let him push him
[59:19] out of your heart
[59:21] he said i don't care what the world says
[59:23] i don't care what the rest of the church
[59:24] says that's for me and my house
[59:26] we're gonna serve the lord i'm gonna
[59:28] give him a place
[59:29] i want him to come in and give me
[59:32] hallelujah

[59:35] knocking at the door
[59:37] to pay you a social call come on someone
[59:40] he's not here to flirt with you tonight
[59:42] he's not looking to give you a
[59:43] visitation he wants you to be the
[59:45] habitation
[59:46] of the living god a temple of the holy
[59:48] ghost he wants to sit down in your house
[59:50] he wants to break bread in your house he
[59:52] wants to commute in your house
[1:00:00] see the world looks at these sevens
[1:00:02] thunders it looks at that prophet
[1:00:04] it looks at these tapes you know what it
[1:00:06] just sees another man
[1:00:07] well you know we had a great healing
[1:00:09] ministry but it kind of just went off
[1:00:10] that's what they say amen that's what
[1:00:12] they see they can't see what
[1:00:14] actually took place amen it's just a
[1:00:16] bunch of
[1:00:17] this and that not listen it's the same
[1:00:19] thing that happened saint john the 12th
[1:00:20] chapter amen
[1:00:21] saint john chapter 12 jesus speaking
[1:00:23] there they said father you come and
[1:00:24] glorify your name
[1:00:25] and this great cloud overshadowed them
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:28] they said i'll have glorified it he says
[1:00:31] i'm going to glorify it again
[1:00:33] amen and the bible says that those that
[1:00:35] stood by
[1:00:36] they said well it was just a sound of
[1:00:38] thunder oh just the angels speaking
[1:00:41] they've done the same thing today in
[1:00:42] this message well i believe that god
[1:00:44] sent a prophet
[1:00:45] yeah that's the angel speaking amen but
[1:00:47] did you recognize the voice behind the
[1:00:48] voice
[1:00:49] we believe in them seven thunders yeah
[1:00:51] but have you recognized the one that
[1:00:52] spoke
[1:00:54] and then we if who believes in seventh
[1:00:56] hundreds we all raise our hand amen
[1:00:58] they can do that other places and not
[1:01:00] even have god
[1:01:02] married two and three four times and
[1:01:03] this and that and all kinds of nonsense
[1:01:05] in their church
[1:01:05] that don't make you special but to
[1:01:07] recognize the voice and jesus said this
[1:01:10] voice
[1:01:12] didn't come from my sake the voice came
[1:01:14] for your sake
[1:01:16] and then will you bring him god did not
[1:01:18] send a prophet to this generation
[1:01:20] to exalt the name of william branham and
[1:01:23] come for your
[1:01:24] sakes he wouldn't even let that man die
[1:01:27] for your sake because he had a message
[1:01:29] to deliver to the people
[1:01:32] amen that's how much god loves you
[1:01:35] that's how much god wants you to
[1:01:36] recognize
[1:01:37] it was him speaking amen oh my my mind
[1:01:41] it's the same thing he's done this day
[1:01:42] the conditions are the same as they
[1:01:44] we're about then the religious world
[1:01:46] they're they can talk about listen they
[1:01:47] know who william branham is
[1:01:48] even listen to these character preachers
[1:01:50] they know exactly who he is but they
[1:01:52] won't
[1:01:52] bear the reproach of the word they want
[1:01:55] his blessings
[1:01:56] they want his gifts they want all this
[1:01:58] other kind of thing but they don't want
[1:01:59] to be bought they want to be identified
[1:02:01] with the reproach of the word amen
[1:02:04] cause that's their zeal we've got
[1:02:06] another zeal
[1:02:08] this bride's got a different kind of
[1:02:09] zeal than that hey man she's not worried
[1:02:11] about how popular
[1:02:12] or how influential or how much money
[1:02:14] she's got
[1:02:15] she wants to make sure i'm right with
[1:02:17] god i don't need to be writing a side of
[1:02:19] the world i'm going to be right with god
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:25] you look at churches today especially
[1:02:28] you know you're more charismatic
[1:02:29] churches and things and
[1:02:30] they're all crying out for revival
[1:02:32] they're praying for revival
[1:02:34] yeah brother talk about them doing the
[1:02:35] same thing we're going to have a revival
[1:02:36] we're waiting for revival we're going to
[1:02:38] have revival
[1:02:39] hey man now let's sit there and have a
[1:02:40] meeting say oh yeah we're having a
[1:02:42] revival
[1:02:43] they were having revival and then they
[1:02:44] said they're waiting on i'm so confused
[1:02:46] you either got it or you don't amen
[1:02:48] listen they're saying they've got
[1:02:49] revival oh this pentecostal church
[1:02:51] we're having revival and the next moment
[1:02:53] we're waiting for god to send revival
[1:02:55] and i'm sitting there scratching my head
[1:02:56] because that only makes sense to me amen
[1:02:58] listen their own words testify against
[1:02:59] them if they need revival that means
[1:03:02] they're dead you don't revive something
[1:03:04] that's alive you revive something that's
[1:03:06] dead amen
[1:03:07] they're dead while they're yet limited
[1:03:09] twice dead
[1:03:10] up their fruit withered they've
[1:03:12] got no fruit
[1:03:14] but this bride she has already been
[1:03:16] revived
[1:03:17] quickening power has come and made her
[1:03:19] don't manifest to her
[1:03:22] listen you've got as much revival today
[1:03:23] as you want because god's giving you as
[1:03:26] much as you can handle
[1:03:27] not even waiting to parcel it out and
[1:03:30] ration it out and
[1:03:31] one day i'll give you a little more
[1:03:32] revival for the you can have as much god
[1:03:34] today as you want
[1:03:35] you're gonna have as much of god in your
[1:03:37] life as you can as you can surrender to
[1:03:39] today
[1:03:39] listen he wants you to have it more than
[1:03:42] you want it it's his pleasure to give it
[1:03:45] to you
[1:03:46] quit acting like god some sort of pauper
[1:03:48] and he's just don't you know
[1:03:49] porcelain out little bits and this and
[1:03:51] that you're some sort of we're not
[1:03:52] beggars
[1:03:53] we are not beggars we're not even
[1:03:56] servants
[1:03:57] we're not even subjects we are sons and
[1:04:00] daughters of god
[1:04:02] we're eating at the masters table we
[1:04:05] don't need to eat crumbs today amen
[1:04:07] those days are over we're done eating
[1:04:09] crumbs we've been made to sit down in
[1:04:12] heavenly places
[1:04:13] with christ jesus
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:21] they missed it amen that's what it is
[1:04:24] brother said they missed it but listen
[1:04:25] quickening power testified what brother
[1:04:27] i'm saying the rising of the sun
[1:04:29] quickening power testified to us what
[1:04:31] that's our lord up there
[1:04:34] that cloud that came over jesus they
[1:04:36] just thought was an angel
[1:04:37] they thought it was thunder what was god
[1:04:39] almighty
[1:04:40] and in this day when science took
[1:04:42] pictures of it
[1:04:44] and then it's in magazines and they try
[1:04:46] to explain it away
[1:04:47] and try to scientifically prove that
[1:04:50] which cannot scientifically exist
[1:04:52] but what brother said they're just not
[1:04:54] looking at the right way you turn this
[1:04:56] way
[1:04:56] you look at the right way that's our
[1:04:59] lord up there
[1:05:01] god has come down again in a cloud more
[1:05:04] than an angel
[1:05:05] more than a messenger it was god
[1:05:08] speaking to us
[1:05:10] he glorified his name and in this
[1:05:12] generation
[1:05:14] in this hour he has glorified his name
[1:05:17] again
[1:05:19] because the word interpreted is the
[1:05:21] manifestation of the name of god
[1:05:23] when he glorifies amen in you and i he
[1:05:26] didn't glorify in a building he didn't
[1:05:28] glorify
[1:05:28] an organization
[1:05:32] oh hallelujah it's him up there
[1:05:35] 1963 testifying jesus christ is the same
[1:05:39] yeah not just in william branham's life
[1:05:42] not just 30 years ago
[1:05:43] today in 2021 in the midst of the
[1:05:46] greatest darkness and the greatest
[1:05:48] deception
[1:05:48] and the greatest battles you've ever
[1:05:50] gone through in your life he is still
[1:05:51] the same
[1:05:52] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:00] christ's been put out by the church
[1:06:02] someone let him in
[1:06:05] i got a witness somebody let him in
[1:06:08] somebody let him come in
[1:06:09] he's not on the outside of the house
[1:06:12] when you're doing this i'm thinking
[1:06:13] don't most people live in their own home
[1:06:16] hey man
[1:06:17] praise the lord listen he's not just
[1:06:19] filling out the paperwork for you
[1:06:21] he's not just sitting there and proxy
[1:06:22] for somebody else this is his dwelling
[1:06:24] place
[1:06:25] this is his permanent residency he don't
[1:06:27] need to file a change of address
[1:06:29] he don't need to update his details
[1:06:31] everything's accurate
[1:06:32] exactly what this bible said it's who he
[1:06:34] is it's who he is amen
[1:06:37] hallelujah
[1:06:40] brother bram says this he says remember
[1:06:43] jesus said when he was here on the earth
[1:06:45] talking to a bunch of people who was
[1:06:47] very religious
[1:06:48] very fine very cultured a very zealous
[1:06:51] people of god
[1:06:53] but jesus said to them in vain you
[1:06:55] worship me
[1:06:56] teaching for doctrine their traditions
[1:06:58] of man remember how
[1:07:00] pious those people was and how zealous
[1:07:03] of god
[1:07:05] he says i believe who were counting the
[1:07:07] people
[1:07:08] who were more zealous today or that day
[1:07:11] they would be more zealous than we are
[1:07:15] well that's pretty humbling isn't it he
[1:07:17] says far more
[1:07:18] when it comes to keeping the traditions
[1:07:21] and the laws and things
[1:07:22] they live by though they sure did they
[1:07:25] actually live what they believe they
[1:07:26] just believed wrong they were sincere
[1:07:28] but they were sincerely wrong amen
[1:07:31] he says and they were very zealous of
[1:07:33] god and they believed god
[1:07:35] but jesus made god made flesh among us
[1:07:38] sit in vain do you worship me he says
[1:07:41] now
[1:07:42] he didn't say they didn't worship him
[1:07:45] they are worshipping him but in vain
[1:07:48] amen amen i want you to really watch
[1:07:51] this for a second here these jews in
[1:07:52] this temple
[1:07:52] they're very zealous for their
[1:07:54] traditions they've got zeal
[1:07:56] and jesus has seals they're about their
[1:07:58] business he's about his own
[1:08:00] the father's business amen they're
[1:08:01] observing the passover he is the
[1:08:03] passover amen
[1:08:04] they've got zeal but when jesus had zeal
[1:08:07] when he began to manifest his zeal the
[1:08:10] disciples took note of him
[1:08:11] they said they remembered it was written
[1:08:15] in other words the zeal in jesus's life
[1:08:17] testified to the scripture amen
[1:08:19] that's a lot of people were zealous over
[1:08:21] a lot they get zealous at ball games
[1:08:23] they consult pep rallies and everything
[1:08:26] else amen
[1:08:27] but when they saw jesus zeal it reminded
[1:08:30] them of the word
[1:08:31] in other words jesus's zeal was
[1:08:34] identified by the scripture
[1:08:36] and this bride she's got another kind of
[1:08:38] zeal it's identified by the word
[1:08:41] and then she can jump she can shout but
[1:08:43] more than that she can live it
[1:08:45] there's a life inside of her that can
[1:08:46] perform the will of god that will obey
[1:08:48] every word in this bible
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:55] listen jesus wasn't just another zealous
[1:08:57] man there's a lot of zealous men in the
[1:08:58] temple that day amen but he wasn't just
[1:09:00] a zealous man
[1:09:01] the bible said he was eating up with it
[1:09:04] it consumed him it had devoured him
[1:09:08] amen hallelujah i looked that word up
[1:09:10] here i'm like what's that mean in the
[1:09:11] greek you know what eaten up means it
[1:09:12] means eating up
[1:09:14] means exactly what it says in other
[1:09:16] words it consumed
[1:09:17] everything within him it began to gnaw
[1:09:19] on him and it aided him and devoured him
[1:09:22] because he couldn't hold his peace no
[1:09:23] more
[1:09:24] jesus couldn't sit there and hold his
[1:09:26] peace any longer he had to do
[1:09:28] something about it that was the zeal in
[1:09:30] his life amen
[1:09:31] you get that kind of zeal you can't sit
[1:09:34] still
[1:09:34] something in you've got to do something
[1:09:36] for the kingdom of god
[1:09:40] you look at this man saul of tarsus who
[1:09:42] would later become known as the apostle
[1:09:43] paul
[1:09:44] listen he tells you when he was a
[1:09:46] pharisee he said he was exceeding
[1:09:47] zealous
[1:09:49] in other words their results i was even
[1:09:51] more zealous he said
[1:09:54] brother ben talks about the scripture
[1:09:55] here in galatians 1 uh 14 he's talking
[1:09:58] about this in the adoption series
[1:09:59] he quotes paul he says i profited in the
[1:10:01] jewish religion
[1:10:03] above many minor equals in my no nation
[1:10:05] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[1:10:07] traditions of their fathers
[1:10:09] number of them says now remember not the
[1:10:11] word of god
[1:10:12] the traditions of the fathers traditions
[1:10:14] of the church in other words
[1:10:16] i guess i was a methodist to the core i
[1:10:18] was a baptist to the core
[1:10:20] i was a pentecostal to the core brother
[1:10:22] graham says oh where are you i want to
[1:10:23] be

[1:11:09] for the resurrected jesus christ in my
[1:11:11] life

[1:11:56] this was saul of tarsus why was he so
[1:11:58] zealous

[1:12:43] with the jews he said they profited by
[1:12:45] their religion

[1:13:02] oh man well i knew it was gonna get kind
[1:13:04] of let's get a little tight in here amen
[1:13:06] listen this man saw tarsus he was a
[1:13:09] pharisee the pharisees
[1:13:10] concerning the law he was blameless
[1:13:12] circumcised on the eighth day
[1:13:14] saturn to gamalia uh just just uh
[1:13:17] hallelujah
[1:13:18] he was just a pinnacle very echelon of
[1:13:21] what the jewish religion could produce
[1:13:23] and so much that he persecuted the
[1:13:24] church
[1:13:26] he said but those things that were
[1:13:28] gained to me
[1:13:30] yeah i was jealous they were game to me
[1:13:35] gained to me i counted them loss
[1:13:38] for the excellence if there's another
[1:13:39] deal right there when you're willing to
[1:13:41] lose
[1:13:42] to getting christ no matter what does
[1:13:45] your reputation
[1:13:46] no matter what does your name or your
[1:13:47] fame or your influence i'll do anything
[1:13:50] i'll pay any price i'll lay down every
[1:13:52] advantage
[1:13:53] i'll throw away every game that i might
[1:13:56] have
[1:13:56] jesus christ i've got to suffer
[1:14:00] if i've got to bleed if i've got to be
[1:14:02] hated for his name
[1:14:03] let me have jesus you can take this
[1:14:06] whole world
[1:14:08] but give me jesus it doesn't matter what
[1:14:11] else comes along
[1:14:12] whatever
[1:14:17] let me have jesus or let me die let me
[1:14:20] perish
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:25] this is really good i had to think about
[1:14:26] this for a while this is good
[1:14:28] these men were zealous they were zealous
[1:14:31] so when jesus come and upended them and
[1:14:34] took away what profited them
[1:14:36] we took away what benefited them these
[1:14:39] men that were zealous
[1:14:40] became jealous
[1:14:44] why were they so jealous of jesus
[1:14:45] because they were zealous for gain
[1:14:47] jesus wasn't going to let them get away
[1:14:49] with that so they become jealous
[1:14:50] because they were zealous for what
[1:14:52] profited them
[1:14:54] listen that's no different than the
[1:14:56] sinner of the publican
[1:14:59] hallelujah see jesus represented
[1:15:03] everything
[1:15:03] that would that would cost them their
[1:15:05] benefit
[1:15:07] he was a threat to everything that they
[1:15:10] stood for and that they believed in
[1:15:12] listen these men in the temple they
[1:15:14] weren't just going to church to have a
[1:15:15] good time this was their livelihood
[1:15:18] oh help me out now their whole life was
[1:15:20] caught up in this religion
[1:15:22] they weren't just walking away from a
[1:15:24] church they were walking from an entire
[1:15:25] lifestyle
[1:15:26] an entire income everything that i had
[1:15:29] was wrapped up in this and jesus
[1:15:31] represented an existential threat to
[1:15:33] everything that they were
[1:15:34] and everything that they believed that's
[1:15:37] why they hate him they were jealous of
[1:15:38] him because they were zealous for their
[1:15:40] traditions
[1:15:40] for them listen for them to admit that
[1:15:42] they were wrong and to a pet
[1:15:44] would be to forfeit everything they had
[1:15:46] gained in their life
[1:15:49] god help us never get to a place where
[1:15:50] we can't forfeit everything
[1:15:53] we get so comfortable well that's why i
[1:15:54] got a good standing at the church i got
[1:15:56] a good job
[1:15:56] i'm this and i come from good family if
[1:15:58] you can't lay that down for jesus christ
[1:16:00] you're of all men most miserable
[1:16:01] you're in the worst place you can be
[1:16:03] right because when you try to save your
[1:16:05] own life you're going to lose it but if
[1:16:06] you lose your life
[1:16:08] for this kingdom for this gospel you'll
[1:16:10] find it amen
[1:16:14] amen well we still got pharisees today
[1:16:17] praise the lord
[1:16:19] hey man we've got scribes and pharisees
[1:16:22] they love long salutations
[1:16:24] they love flattering titles they love to
[1:16:26] have the best seats
[1:16:27] they love to to to devour widows houses
[1:16:30] the bible says amen praise the lord
[1:16:35] listen you got people they won't have
[1:16:36] nothing to do with churches they can't
[1:16:37] be the center of attention
[1:16:39] they don't have nothing to do with
[1:16:40] church but don't benefit them somehow
[1:16:41] well i might lose money i might lose
[1:16:43] fame i might not be popular
[1:16:44] if that's the only reason you're going
[1:16:46] you're going for the wrong reason you're
[1:16:47] not
[1:16:48] i praise god i hope that listen this
[1:16:49] house of god i trust that this house of
[1:16:52] god
[1:16:52] is not a place where we can come and be
[1:16:54] seen and heard of men
[1:16:55] we can come to get some some esteem from
[1:16:57] a man we come here
[1:16:59] to submit to god almighty god whatever
[1:17:02] you have to do in my life
[1:17:04] let me testify at the end of the day
[1:17:06] we're unprofitable servants
[1:17:08] we have done that which was required of
[1:17:10] us we presented ourselves
[1:17:11] a living sacrifice it's a reasonable
[1:17:15] listen we owe him just that much he
[1:17:18] deserves all the praise
[1:17:20] he deserves all the glory if you've got
[1:17:22] to live out of a cardboard box
[1:17:23] and eat soda crackers and drink breasts
[1:17:25] while the rest of your life
[1:17:26] he's still been good to you he still
[1:17:29] give you more than you deserve
[1:17:33] now they're shaking up and they're
[1:17:34] worried here comes jesus we gotta do
[1:17:36] something about him
[1:17:37] i mean he's he's threatening our way of
[1:17:39] life he's actually threatening your
[1:17:41] whole life you've got to die
[1:17:42] receive this life amen hallelujah praise
[1:17:44] the lord
[1:17:47] i tell you what
[1:17:50] they hated jesus so much they did every
[1:17:54] they did everything they could to
[1:17:55] destroy his influence they sought to
[1:17:57] undermine him
[1:17:58] and slander him and tell rumors about
[1:18:00] him they even they killed him
[1:18:01] all because of money all because their
[1:18:04] results for their traditions
[1:18:07] amen my my
[1:18:11] you look at a man like saul of tarsus a
[1:18:13] persecutor of the church
[1:18:15] blasphemed god that's his own confession
[1:18:18] he said i was the chief of sinners
[1:18:21] this man looks so good and he was so
[1:18:23] styled and so influential and so
[1:18:25] powerful and so intelligent
[1:18:27] he said i was a blasphemer in the
[1:18:28] persecution of the church the very
[1:18:30] cheapest of sinners but those things
[1:18:32] which were gained
[1:18:34] they're not gain to me anymore oh saul
[1:18:36] of tarsus he met that same
[1:18:38] light on the road to damascus one day
[1:18:40] that same way that come down this
[1:18:41] generation
[1:18:42] it struck him off his high horse that
[1:18:44] little sarcastic hook no
[1:18:46] sideways mouth jew it just went around
[1:18:48] like it was a big shot
[1:18:49] it knocked him off his high horse even
[1:18:52] changed his name called the apostle paul
[1:18:54] something happened in that man's life
[1:18:57] things that
[1:18:57] that every man would count as gain
[1:19:00] listen think
[1:19:01] things that were crazy he just laid all
[1:19:04] that down for nothing
[1:19:06] he just walked out of the job laid down
[1:19:08] his title laid down everything because
[1:19:10] he found something greater
[1:19:12] now let me let me fix that something
[1:19:14] greater found him
[1:19:16] something plucked him like a brand from
[1:19:19] the fire
[1:19:20] he wasn't willing to walk away god had
[1:19:22] to take that out of it god had to get a
[1:19:24] hold of that man's life said no i've
[1:19:25] chosen you
[1:19:26] you are a vessel you're appointed to be
[1:19:29] a light to the gentiles
[1:19:31] you're going to suffer you're not going
[1:19:33] to profit from my name you're you're
[1:19:35] gonna suffer
[1:19:36] things for my name is hank so i'm gonna
[1:19:39] make you an example of the long
[1:19:41] suffering of god well that's not the
[1:19:43] example most of us want to be
[1:19:46] there's a partner that's going into it
[1:19:48] actually
[1:19:52] here's ananias i want you to go down
[1:19:53] there and lay hands on this man i've
[1:19:55] ordained him to be a prophet i've
[1:19:57] ordained him to be an apostle i've
[1:19:58] ordained this man to do this and here's
[1:20:00] another
[1:20:01] ass in a vision i don't know about that
[1:20:04] you sure about that lord yeah you're in
[1:20:07] a vision aren't you
[1:20:09] did i stutter that man you might not
[1:20:13] look at his life and see anything godly
[1:20:14] in it but god's in that man somewhere
[1:20:17] god's fixing to do something in his life
[1:20:20] you'll know it because i'll forfeit
[1:20:22] everything that used to be dude
[1:20:26] amen let me say this this way this man
[1:20:31] was a zealous man as a pharisee but now
[1:20:35] you look at a converted apostle paul a
[1:20:37] man that's zealous
[1:20:38] not after the tradition of his fathers
[1:20:40] not after the rudiments of a carnal
[1:20:42] commandment a man that's zealous for the
[1:20:44] kingdom of god
[1:20:46] you say i want that kind of zeal i need
[1:20:48] a greater zeal my life what's the secret
[1:20:50] it's actually real simple
[1:20:51] yeah see paul had this kind of zeal
[1:20:54] a believer will have another kind of a
[1:20:56] zeal what is it
[1:20:59] here's the secret the apostle paul was
[1:21:02] jealous
[1:21:05] i got an eyebrow there you go hey buddy
[1:21:07] listen the apostle paul was a jealous
[1:21:09] man he said what listen he wasn't
[1:21:12] jealous of another man
[1:21:14] amen those those chief apostles that
[1:21:16] walked into the church of corinth
[1:21:17] they could sit there and boast about
[1:21:19] their gifts they could boast about their
[1:21:20] calling and paul said they've got
[1:21:22] nothing to compare
[1:21:23] those are messengers of unrighteousness
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:26] he says but i'm jealous over you with a
[1:21:29] godly jealousy
[1:21:31] he wasn't joseph a man he was a jealous
[1:21:33] position he was the
[1:21:34] jealousy of god in him over a bride
[1:21:37] that's what made him zealous amen
[1:21:41] he was jealous for god's sake that made
[1:21:43] himself
[1:21:44] see when he was carnal he was zealous
[1:21:46] and it made him jealous but this man had
[1:21:47] a jealousy for the things of god it made
[1:21:49] him zealous for the kingdom
[1:21:52] well holiday i hope somebody gets that
[1:21:53] hey man the the fervency and the desire
[1:21:56] in his heart
[1:21:57] to see to present a chaste bride unto
[1:22:00] jesus christ
[1:22:01] was the driving imperative every moment
[1:22:04] of his life
[1:22:05] this man can testify i've been
[1:22:07] shipwrecked i've been beaten
[1:22:09] i've been hungered i've been thirsted
[1:22:11] i've done all these things if any man
[1:22:12] let him boast
[1:22:13] the man what's the boss i'm gonna glory
[1:22:15] in my infirmities
[1:22:17] i've suffered for this church i'm
[1:22:19] blessed for this church
[1:22:21] i'm willing to die for this church
[1:22:23] that's his credentials
[1:22:25] not the size of his bank account not the
[1:22:27] power of his influence
[1:22:28] not his worldwide fame i'm ready to
[1:22:31] suffer
[1:22:32] i have suffered i will suffer i'll lay
[1:22:35] my life down he said i can even wish
[1:22:38] myself a curse
[1:22:40] for my brethren's sake that they might
[1:22:41] be saying woo
[1:22:46] it's a whole nother kind of zeal isn't
[1:22:47] it right man
[1:22:53] zealous amen he was zealous for the
[1:22:55] people of god
[1:22:56] hallelujah he was a stranger to his own
[1:23:00] brethren
[1:23:01] he bore the reproach of christ there was
[1:23:03] his zeal you want to see a zeal that's
[1:23:05] what it looks like amen
[1:23:06] listen jesus that's the kind of zeal he
[1:23:08] had they didn't adore him for the zeal
[1:23:10] he showed that day in the temple
[1:23:12] they didn't say oh man he just loves god
[1:23:14] what a wonderful worshiper now they
[1:23:16] hated him for it
[1:23:18] and that was the zeal of god on display
[1:23:20] why because it wasn't a zeal
[1:23:22] for anything but the house of god
[1:23:25] the same kind of seal paul had not a
[1:23:27] natural building not a natural house
[1:23:29] the house of law of god's habitation his
[1:23:32] church
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:45] praise the lord i'm gonna appreciate
[1:23:47] anyhow the devil don't like it
[1:23:49] and i don't care the devil don't like it
[1:23:51] i like it even more
[1:23:53] hey man listen i'm not gonna let i'm not
[1:23:55] talking about this microphone now amen
[1:23:57] i'm not gonna let the devil shut me up
[1:23:59] you should let him set you up either
[1:24:01] he'll talk at you
[1:24:02] and he'll run his mouth he'll do
[1:24:03] everything he can to shut you down
[1:24:05] you get in his face listen jesus didn't
[1:24:08] back down to the devil
[1:24:10] he said it is written you've got that
[1:24:12] today
[1:24:15] i've got a right to speak the word of
[1:24:16] god i've got a right to prophesy again
[1:24:18] the scripture speaks of you and i
[1:24:21] the scripture is spoken things over your
[1:24:22] life i'm not here by chance
[1:24:24] you're not here by some sort of
[1:24:25] happiness we are upheld
[1:24:27] by revelation we are guided by prophecy
[1:24:30] we've been placed by god
[1:24:33] the devil don't like you you're in a
[1:24:34] good place
[1:24:36] you know when you've got the devil
[1:24:37] sitting up you're in a good place
[1:24:41] the devil man you better make him mad
[1:24:42] right now the devil ought to make you
[1:24:44] mad
[1:24:45] well i'm gonna get ahead of myself harry
[1:24:47] man listen it makes jesus mad
[1:24:49] why because you're his passion you're
[1:24:51] his desire he knew
[1:24:53] he was gonna suffer he knew he was gonna
[1:24:55] die and then he did it anyway because
[1:24:56] you were his joy the joy that was set
[1:24:58] before him
[1:25:00] you're his bride he said i ain't gonna
[1:25:03] let the devil
[1:25:04] man handle them anymore
[1:25:12] you look at isaiah 53 everything christ
[1:25:14] did who'd he do it for
[1:25:16] he didn't do it for himself it wasn't
[1:25:18] gained to him he did it for you
[1:25:20] that's the zeal of god and the believer
[1:25:23] today to do something for somebody else
[1:25:25] because eternal life is living for
[1:25:27] others it's from life and about how
[1:25:29] exciting you are or how popular you
[1:25:32] might be the weakest lowest most
[1:25:34] insignificant person in the world
[1:25:35] but to god you're somebody he suffered
[1:25:38] for you he died for you he rose again
[1:25:40] for you
[1:25:41] don't let the devil tell you you ain't
[1:25:42] worth now that

[1:26:59] didn't buy none he'd been paid for a
[1:27:01] long time ago

[1:29:49] fox book of martyrs
[1:29:50] talking about saint lawrence he was a
[1:29:52] deacon i think it was in the church of
[1:29:53] rome
[1:29:53] he was a deacon there does anybody know
[1:29:55] this story well you're fixing to either
[1:29:56] way
[1:29:57] this man was a deacon in a church room
[1:29:58] and emperor valerian summoned him to the
[1:30:00] throne
[1:30:01] he said i want your church to pay
[1:30:03] tribute to me
[1:30:04] i'm the emperor now i want you to bring
[1:30:06] me all the riches of your church
[1:30:07] in three days you return with the riches
[1:30:10] of your church

[1:30:40] great emperor i have this is the riches
[1:30:43] of the church
[1:30:46] this is the riches of christ's purchase
[1:30:49] see so different than what the world
[1:30:50] looks at see the emperor's looking for
[1:30:52] something to gain from it
[1:30:53] he said listen this is
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:57] glory this means something to god more
[1:31:00] than money more than fame
[1:31:03] they can't even walk in and bring
[1:31:04] themselves to church that means
[1:31:06] something to christ
[1:31:09] or the making you and me more than
[1:31:10] making you money he died for that one
[1:31:13] that you think's nothing that man was
[1:31:16] insulted by that offering but that was
[1:31:18] the greatest gift
[1:31:19] god can reach the lowest the most infirm
[1:31:22] the weakest the most discarded
[1:31:24] the outcast that's what makes god so
[1:31:26] great
[1:31:27] he's that humble
[1:31:33] a poor man can't humble himself that low
[1:31:35] he's already low to begin with
[1:31:36] this is the greatest the mightiest more
[1:31:39] than ever
[1:31:40] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[1:31:42] he suffered and died for that one
[1:31:44] he thought it was trash but that was
[1:31:46] god's great purchase of his blood
[1:31:48] [Applause]
[1:31:50] how dare we today sit here and try to
[1:31:52] exalt ourselves
[1:31:53] or some other thing that's the present
[1:31:56] that's the treasure
[1:31:58] that what nobody thinks about no there's
[1:32:00] nobody cares about them
[1:32:01] god cares about them if god's in you god
[1:32:03] will care about them
[1:32:08] tell you what listen let me say it this
[1:32:12] way the zeal of this house you fall in
[1:32:13] love with jesus you'll fall in love with
[1:32:15] one another
[1:32:16] if you fall in love with another one
[1:32:17] another that z will eat you up
[1:32:19] it'll make you lose some sleep but not
[1:32:21] when you're praying for one another
[1:32:22] it'll make you it'll agonize and bother
[1:32:24] you it'll keep you up
[1:32:26] cause something on the inside is burning
[1:32:28] you i've got to see souls for christ
[1:32:31] i've got to see a deliverance it's
[1:32:33] christ in you
[1:32:35] that's the zeal of this house because
[1:32:38] the other love one another
[1:32:39] god is jealous over you with a godly
[1:32:41] jealousy
[1:32:43] you're worth more to him than buildings
[1:32:45] and god and celery and fame
[1:32:47] you're worth everything to him
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:51] listen many of us many of us not all of
[1:32:53] us we've been hurt somewhere in our
[1:32:54] lives we get hurt by people at church
[1:32:56] we get hurt by family we get hurt at a
[1:32:58] job whatever it is we're going through
[1:33:00] things and we get hurt
[1:33:01] we've got problems you know what
[1:33:03] sometimes it just drives you to your
[1:33:04] knees
[1:33:05] sometimes it just breaks you you get to
[1:33:07] a point where it just eats you up on the
[1:33:08] inside
[1:33:10] but if the zeal ever gets inside you one
[1:33:12] time and it eats you up like that it'll
[1:33:13] do something in your life
[1:33:14] more than just make you feel bad and
[1:33:17] then when the zeal eats you up it'll
[1:33:18] start keeping you off
[1:33:20] you'll start driving driving the things
[1:33:23] out of your life that are not a god
[1:33:26] this seal won't let you settle it won't
[1:33:28] let you compromise
[1:33:32] it won't let you sit idle there's
[1:33:33] something on the inside of a believer
[1:33:35] it's got the zeal of this house it's
[1:33:37] their burning desire it drives them
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:40] i'm going to keep pressing on i'm going
[1:33:42] to keep pushing i'm not going to back
[1:33:44] down now

[1:33:46] else wants to serve god
[1:33:48] as for me and my house we're still going
[1:33:50] to serve the lord
[1:33:53] i've got to keep going listen there's
[1:33:55] been times brothers i'll be honest with
[1:33:56] you sisters
[1:33:57] brothers and sisters there's been times
[1:33:58] i wanted to give up
[1:34:00] i wonder what not from god that time
[1:34:03] about abandoning god but i just want to
[1:34:04] just want to go lay down and live in a
[1:34:06] cave and be a hermit just walk away from
[1:34:07] it all amen but listen the more i tried
[1:34:09] to hold it back
[1:34:10] the more it was like a fire shut up
[1:34:12] inside my bones
[1:34:14] the more i wanted to quit the more god
[1:34:15] said you can't quit you didn't start it
[1:34:19] sometimes i wouldn't give up and says
[1:34:21] you didn't start you can't lay it down
[1:34:22] you can't quit i ain't done with you
[1:34:25] it's not up to you to decide when god's
[1:34:26] done with you
[1:34:28] you don't make that call you don't make
[1:34:30] that decision
[1:34:33] do you think jesus says a man wants to
[1:34:34] go in there and fill a bunch of tables
[1:34:35] over
[1:34:36] but god inside and said i can't let that
[1:34:38] stand
[1:34:39] i won't let that rest my father's house

[1:35:52] you've never left yourself without a
[1:35:54] witness
[1:35:58] can i tell you about some people in the
[1:35:59] bible amen listen amen there's a man by
[1:36:01] the name of elijah
[1:36:02] we had a prophet the same spirit today
[1:36:04] that first elijah in the bible he went
[1:36:06] to mount carmel
[1:36:07] amen he had a showdown with some
[1:36:09] prophets of baal amen
[1:36:11] what did he say when he got up there he
[1:36:13] goes and hides in a cave
[1:36:15] he gets so discouraged he stopped to
[1:36:17] spot some woman chasing him now
[1:36:19] he begins to call on god and what does
[1:36:21] the man say god
[1:36:22] i have been very jealous for the lord
[1:36:25] god of hosts
[1:36:27] that was his jealousy i've been jealous
[1:36:29] for you lord i did these things with
[1:36:31] your word because i've been jealous for
[1:36:32] the lord of hosts
[1:36:38] i believe we've had an elijah look at
[1:36:39] this day i believe our eleazar was not
[1:36:41] willing to find some
[1:36:42] some other woman to compromise he had to
[1:36:44] find that one that would water the camel
[1:36:46] that would come back and marry isaac
[1:36:48] because that's the kind god was looking
[1:36:50] for believe you've got to have a certain
[1:36:52] kind of testimony amen
[1:36:55] it's not my testimony it's god's
[1:36:56] testimony in us
[1:36:58] we're more than just a good church
[1:36:59] member we're more than just a good pew
[1:37:01] warmer

[1:37:05] the purpose of god fulfilled
[1:37:09] you take a man by the name of jehu
[1:37:10] anointed by prophecy
[1:37:12] he was anointed to say jezebel i think
[1:37:14] we got something like that here today
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:16] you've been anointed by the prophet to
[1:37:19] destroy
[1:37:20] this jezebel system who didn't sit
[1:37:23] around in question
[1:37:24] he didn't get out a book and read it and
[1:37:26] try to study it he got on his chariot
[1:37:29] he rolled out and he made war on jezebel
[1:37:32] let me say today i'm declaring war this
[1:37:35] afternoon
[1:37:36] on satan i ain't going to rest until i
[1:37:39] put

[1:37:52] you know we can all just co-exist
[1:37:53] together we can live peacefully we can
[1:37:56] have peace

[1:37:59] jezebel's
[1:38:00] boredoms pollute this land there'll be
[1:38:03] no peace jesus said i didn't come to
[1:38:05] bring you that kind of peace
[1:38:06] i've come to bring you a sword
[1:38:09] he said i don't have nothing to fight
[1:38:11] the devil with today that's a lie
[1:38:13] you've got a sword the sword of the
[1:38:15] kings in your hands you've got what it
[1:38:16] takes to defeat

[1:52:33] they were willing to die for the cause
[1:52:35] of liberty they'd rather die
[1:52:37] than not have liberty amen these were
[1:52:39] men that were rugged they signed their
[1:52:41] name on a declaration of independence

[1:52:46] where we'll die

[1:53:40] i better say novice here has to give up
[1:53:42] with moses and the natural had to give
[1:53:43] up
[1:53:44] but he saw the reproach of christ and he
[1:53:47] esteemed it
[1:53:48] greater than the riches of egypt that's
[1:53:54] the zeal john was preaching about the
[1:53:55] wilderness
[1:53:56] repent yes turn your heart towards god
[1:54:00] who is he preaching to he wasn't

[1:57:56] sun tzu talks about this hope that's
[1:57:58] okay he says whenever you attack an
[1:58:00] inmate you never want to completely trap
[1:58:02] him you always want to leave him
[1:58:03] out of the scape why is that you say
[1:58:06] that doesn't sound
[1:58:07] doesn't make sense as long as he has a
[1:58:09] way to escape
[1:58:10] he will try to escape rather than fight
[1:58:12] you right but as soon as you have
[1:58:14] nowhere
[1:58:15] left to run and you have nowhere to
[1:58:17] retreat
[1:58:18] you will stand and fight like you've
[1:58:20] never fought before because now you're
[1:58:21] fighting for your life
[1:58:23] when you've got no escape plan that's
[1:58:25] when you really start fighting
[1:58:27] let me tell you brothers and sisters too
[1:58:29] many christians today they still got an
[1:58:30] escape plan

[1:58:35] through for me
[1:58:36] i've got daddy's idol we've got too many
[1:58:38] backups
[1:58:39] there is no other way out let's stand
[1:58:41] and fight
[1:58:43] we're gonna fight and live or we're
[1:58:45] gonna fight and die but either way let's
[1:58:47] fight amen
[1:58:48] let's fight the enemy with everything
[1:58:49] that's in us amen
[1:58:53] is that right you lose your life you
[1:58:54] might find it he said the way he has to
[1:58:56] repent
