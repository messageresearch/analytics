[36:17] 11.
[36:23] for my thoughts
[36:25] are not your thoughts
[36:28] and neither
[36:29] are your ways
[36:31] my ways
[36:32] saith the lord
[36:35] for as the heavens are higher than the
[36:37] earth
[36:38] so are my ways higher than your ways
[36:43] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[36:46] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[36:48] from heaven and returneth not tether but
[36:50] waters the earth and make it to bring
[36:52] forth and bud that it may give seed to
[36:55] the sore and bread to the eater
[36:58] soul shall my word be that go forth out
[37:00] of my mouth
[37:01] it shall not return unto me void but it
[37:04] shall accomplish that what i please
[37:07] and it shall prosper
[37:09] in the thing or unto i sent it
[37:12] amen we ask the lord to bless his word
[37:14] tonight as you may be seated
[37:16] amen we want to greet you all of course
[37:18] from brother erickson and the church at
[37:20] true word there and amen
[37:23] brother samuel said i'm just going to be
[37:25] at home tonight so i'm just going to be
[37:27] at home and and and just act like i'm at
[37:29] home so amen we're going to greet you
[37:31] and then i'm just going to go into this
[37:32] word and and speak a few things here
[37:35] that's been on her heart and i want to
[37:37] speak to you tonight if i can
[37:39] i i want to talk to you about
[37:41] our god
[37:42] the waymaker
[37:44] our god
[37:46] the waymaker amen and i i just want to
[37:49] maybe just share a few things from here
[37:51] tonight and uh i i would look here at a
[37:54] prophet uh in 1963 he preaches a sermon
[37:57] entitled there's only one provided way
[38:00] for anything
[38:01] amen and i i just enjoyed the title
[38:04] there's only one provided way for
[38:06] anything amen so in paragraph 45 he'll
[38:10] say this there is one way to do anything
[38:13] and that's god's way
[38:15] there is one way to do it and that's
[38:17] god's way and outside of that it's all
[38:20] off because it will not reproduce itself
[38:23] again if i got scriptures for these
[38:25] things to prove it
[38:26] amen now in god's provided way for this
[38:30] day he says god always had a way
[38:34] and there are two ways that's our way
[38:37] and his way
[38:39] god has a way for today he's always made
[38:42] a way for everything
[38:44] and again uh healing and what sickness
[38:48] is 1950 your way and my way is wrong
[38:53] and god's way is always right
[38:56] and there's something brother brahm said
[38:58] now there's two ways there's your way
[39:00] and there's god's way and brother brahm
[39:02] said your way is always wrong
[39:05] now that's a good way to start it
[39:07] amen we're just all wrong amen amen it's
[39:10] always wrong see now watch a prophet
[39:12] he'll say it like this now there's two
[39:14] ways a man can go
[39:16] and that's his way or god's way
[39:19] and that's the right way
[39:20] or the wrong way
[39:22] that's that's that's putting her right
[39:24] down there isn't it it's either that way
[39:26] or the wrong way and your way is always
[39:30] the wrong way
[39:32] and god's way is the right way
[39:35] and you can't be in your own way and in
[39:38] god's way at the same time
[39:41] isn't that something you can't be in
[39:43] both at the same time you either in
[39:46] god's way or you're in your way amen and
[39:49] if you're in your way tonight let me
[39:50] just say it right out it's wrong amen
[39:53] but there is a way that's right and god
[39:55] always provides a way and that way is
[39:58] god's way amen so if you brother brahman
[40:01] said it like this he said you can't be
[40:03] in your own way and in god's at the same
[40:05] time so you've got to get out of your
[40:07] own way so god can have his way amen
[40:11] that's that's god's provided way amen
[40:14] now here again in god's provided way he
[40:17] said if you're going your way you're out
[40:20] of god's way and if you cease from your
[40:22] own way you can get in god's way and god
[40:26] can have his way when you cease to have
[40:28] your way but as long as you're having
[40:31] your way
[40:32] god can't have his way
[40:35] so you have to get into one or the other
[40:37] so let's just get out of our own way
[40:39] drop it tonight and let's let god have
[40:42] his way amen i'll tell you we ought to
[40:44] just let go and let god amen just let
[40:47] him have his way amen again god's
[40:49] provided way for as long as you're in
[40:52] your way you're out of his way so
[40:54] forsake your way so one time he tells us
[40:56] to cease from it another time he says
[40:59] drop it and now he's going to tell us
[41:01] amen that we need to forsake it and he
[41:04] used the scripture forsake your thought
[41:06] forsake everything and just rely on thus
[41:09] saith the lord that's right see amen
[41:12] there's there's a way that god has and
[41:14] there's a way that we have and we either
[41:16] need to drop it let it loose cease from
[41:18] it forsake it in other words
[41:21] there would be no reason to hold on to
[41:23] our own way if god's made one because
[41:27] when god provides a way everything that
[41:29] we need amen is a provided way and
[41:32] there's a provision in it that god has
[41:34] provided for the church amen now the
[41:36] prophet will tell us this he said well
[41:38] that's a way in this age that we're
[41:40] living in you've got to find god's way
[41:43] of doing it for the age and that's what
[41:45] martin luther found and that's what john
[41:47] wesley found and that's what the
[41:49] pentecostals found in their age you've
[41:52] got to find god's age and time to do it
[41:54] you've got to find god's age and the
[41:56] time to do it so if you want to be very
[41:58] effective in your life and the time that
[42:01] we're living you've got to find out what
[42:03] god has provided for the day and then
[42:05] walk in that provision then get in the
[42:08] way that god has done it you know i
[42:10] think it's a powerful thing myself
[42:12] because anytime you find god's way then
[42:14] you're finding that god is behind what
[42:16] you're doing it's not just you trying to
[42:18] do it but it's what god is doing in it
[42:21] you know sometimes you see people who
[42:23] are frustrating their own selves because
[42:25] they're trying to try to do things and
[42:27] they try and they really work hard but
[42:29] they're working in their own way of
[42:31] doing it and by doing that they're
[42:33] frustrating the grace of god amen and
[42:36] god can't even do it for them because
[42:38] they got their own mind it's got to be
[42:39] this way or it's got to happen like this
[42:41] it kind of reminds me of a farmer you
[42:44] know
[42:45] maybe maybe a farmer decides he's gonna
[42:47] he's gonna just break the mold and he's
[42:49] gonna have a corn crop in the middle of
[42:51] bay so he goes out in december in ohio
[42:53] and tries to plant some corn well i'll
[42:56] tell you this god provided a way to have
[42:58] a corn crop and you're never going to
[43:00] get it planting it in december and
[43:02] harvesting in may
[43:04] you're going to have to plant it in may
[43:06] and harvest it in august because that's
[43:08] the way god provided it for it to happen
[43:11] and if you work in that provision amen
[43:14] then that then the very law will work
[43:17] for you amen and you you don't have to
[43:19] do anything to put the seed in the
[43:20] ground and let the water come on it and
[43:22] it'll just take place amen and there's
[43:24] things that god has for you tonight in
[43:27] your life that this word of god is a
[43:30] seed and if it's planted in the season
[43:33] that god has anointed it for you don't
[43:35] have to work your head off you've got to
[43:37] plant the seed and begin to water amen
[43:40] that seed with the praise of god and
[43:42] you'll find there's an abundance and a
[43:45] harvest and a revelation that comes to
[43:47] the church of god who's walking not in
[43:49] their own way have forsaken their way
[43:52] and they walk it in the way of god now
[43:54] see you've got to find god's way of
[43:55] doing it and i believe god's way of
[43:57] doing it in this age has always spoke by
[44:00] a prophet of god god's way of doing
[44:02] anything has been spoken in his word now
[44:05] there's two ways i always like to
[44:07] remember these two words always and only
[44:09] if you amen and i probably told you
[44:11] before i'm going to tell you again
[44:13] always and only saying with me always
[44:14] and only
[44:16] god always and only reveals his secrets
[44:19] by a prophet
[44:21] god always and only reveals his secrets
[44:23] by a prophet so god's way would be given
[44:26] to us in this age through a prophetic
[44:29] word it would not come through
[44:30] denomination it's not going to come
[44:32] through independence amen some of the
[44:34] independence is actually worse than the
[44:35] denominations some of the denominations
[44:38] are more grounded scripturally than some
[44:40] of the independents when they get away
[44:42] from a prophet i i have to be honest
[44:44] sometimes you hear guys hey man get
[44:46] around the message and start studying
[44:47] brother brown next thing you know man
[44:49] they got us so far out in la la land
[44:51] amen that we're out in the millennium
[44:53] and amen and the rapture is already over
[44:55] and amen and here we are in these bodies
[44:57] fighting this fight and i'm thinking i'm
[44:59] a disappointed guy if this is a
[45:00] millennium because i was i was for sure
[45:02] i'd have an immortal body amen you you
[45:05] see the promises of the scripture amen
[45:07] but if if you leave headship you can go
[45:09] anywhere as i often say it like this
[45:11] amen when you get into an astronaut age
[45:14] you leave the gravity of the earth can i
[45:16] say denominations or a bit of gravity at
[45:18] least and they keep people in
[45:20] fundamentals of scripture and things but
[45:22] if you're going to get in the message
[45:23] and you're going to leave gravity of
[45:25] denomination and you're going to get in
[45:27] the heavenlies he meant what happens to
[45:29] an astronaut who loses his tether to the
[45:32] spaceship in heavens
[45:34] if if an astronaut's up in the heavens
[45:36] and he gets out of his spaceship and
[45:38] he's not tethered anymore he'll float
[45:40] off anywhere he'll just go off somewhere
[45:42] hey man there's a never-ending amen and
[45:45] so is it today you come out in the
[45:48] message but if you don't stay tied to
[45:50] the word of god he meant in this age to
[45:53] a prophetic voice people are liable to
[45:55] teach anything hey they'll teach we
[45:57] don't need more miracles they'll teach
[45:59] we don't need the holy ghost they'll
[46:01] teach amen there's no more worship no
[46:03] more praise they'll teach we don't even
[46:05] need preachers in the pulpit anymore
[46:07] amen and god has a way of doing
[46:09] everything and it always and only comes
[46:12] through a prophet so to walk in god's
[46:14] way we've got to walk under the message
[46:17] of the hour that we've been placed here
[46:19] to walk in now i i i don't know
[46:21] sometimes i find out that it's just a
[46:24] little easier to be simple than it is to
[46:26] be a
[46:27] is to be a great big somebody amen i'll
[46:29] tell you this some people sometimes
[46:31] somebody called me simple here a while
[46:32] back and and i i actually thanked him
[46:34] for it you know because uh because i
[46:37] read the scripture where the bible said
[46:39] blessed are they that are meat for they
[46:41] shall inherit the earth but ram said
[46:43] that word meek is simple
[46:45] amen they shall inherit the earth do you
[46:47] know who that melchizedek came to in the
[46:50] days of abraham do you know who elohim
[46:52] spoke to in the days of abraham and said
[46:54] amen i can't hide anything from you
[46:56] abraham because you are heir to the
[46:58] earth and that's why the revelation came
[47:00] to abraham because he was heir of the
[47:02] earth and so are we connected in romans
[47:05] 4 with the same promise and the promises
[47:07] under abraham's seed come on we're
[47:09] supposed to have redeemed bodies in a
[47:12] redeemed earth in a redeemed heaven amen
[47:15] we're not just we're not just
[47:17] out here floating around there's some
[47:19] promises for the church of the living
[47:21] god and you know in simplicity i just
[47:24] sometimes find things
[47:26] and and i'm i mean you know we grew up
[47:28] in arkansas i seen a lot of chickens in
[47:30] my time and hey man we we've seen we've
[47:33] seen a lot of chickens and we gathered
[47:35] eggs and we killed chickens and we've
[47:37] you know i mean we've had the farm
[47:39] experience but you know something i've
[47:41] lived i've lived i'm nearly 50 years old
[47:43] now amen and from the time that i've
[47:45] been a little kid and in this great
[47:48] civilization of advanced science do you
[47:50] know that they have not found a better
[47:52] way for a chicken to be born than to
[47:55] hatch out of an egg
[47:57] they just ain't found a better way
[48:00] you you you know what the prophet said
[48:02] about it right but the man said i don't
[48:04] care how long we go if that's god's way
[48:07] you'll never find a better way
[48:09] is that right there's not a better way
[48:11] amen now the prophet teaches us in that
[48:14] that's where brother brown brings in uh
[48:16] how to peep out of an egg y'all remember
[48:18] that he said you got a peep out of the
[48:19] egg and he talks about the little
[48:21] chicken he said he's in the in the egg
[48:23] and he's got to come out of the shell
[48:24] he's got to peep his way out well the
[48:26] only the best way and the only way for a
[48:29] chicken to get out of an egg is to peep
[48:30] his way out of that it's to it's to
[48:32] break out of it and and to think about
[48:34] it that god provides him with everything
[48:37] he needs to do it
[48:39] inside the egg nobody has to break the
[48:41] egg open and put something in there for
[48:43] that chicken to get out of there god
[48:45] gave him a little beak and when he
[48:47] starts developing his beak it's there
[48:49] and he can hit that egg with his beak
[48:52] from the inside and and he gets stronger
[48:55] every time he hits it and by the time he
[48:57] gets out he can live in the outside
[48:59] world because it took something to break
[49:02] through it listen i find they meant that
[49:04] if you just help somebody all the time
[49:06] and they don't have to work through no
[49:08] struggles hey man you get somebody that
[49:10] can't overcome
[49:11] they can't overcome somebody didn't
[49:13] shake my hand or amen or or somebody
[49:15] didn't sing my psalm you know but if you
[49:17] ever get somebody that's peeped out amen
[49:20] and they and they've overcome they broke
[49:22] out of the shell amen they got some
[49:24] resistance on the inside of them that
[49:26] they're able to live on the outside of
[49:28] this world and i'll tell you amen god
[49:31] has a way of doing it and you're never
[49:32] going to get better than god's way of
[49:34] doing it is that right now how do they
[49:36] get out there they get out of that
[49:37] through that beak is that right so how
[49:39] does the church going to get out of
[49:40] their situations by the word they're
[49:43] going to get out of that and what word
[49:44] is that that's the word of faith the
[49:47] word of the hour that is preached in
[49:49] this age and it's going to get them out
[49:51] now think of this because amen you and i
[49:53] can break them out of the egg but we can
[49:56] build an atmosphere that is conducive to
[49:59] life even when it's in the egg and i
[50:01] pray to god amen amen that the church of
[50:04] the living god keeps an atmosphere of
[50:07] the holy ghost where young chickens
[50:09] young eagles can be birthed he meant
[50:11] into the word of god and come out in
[50:14] this age now there's not a there's not a
[50:16] better way to do it amen it just ain't
[50:18] going to have no better way i find out
[50:20] this brother branham said it he said it
[50:22] like this he said if you'll take it for
[50:24] for an example he said if you'll take
[50:26] this example of making a point that's
[50:28] god's way for a christian to be born
[50:31] he says not that he'd walk up to an
[50:33] altar and give a man his right hand and
[50:35] put his name on the book but get down
[50:37] there and peep and cry and beg and plead
[50:39] until god gives you some strength and
[50:41] you've got to come forth out of the
[50:42] shell of this word if somebody maybe a
[50:45] pastor just cracks the shell to take it
[50:46] out he said we'll take you out in anyhow
[50:49] he said you're dead that's all there is
[50:51] to it he says you've got to come god's
[50:53] way and that's the rest of them had to
[50:56] come that way by being born to the
[50:58] spirit of god stay there how long until
[51:02] he told them first group of pentecostals
[51:04] to carry in jerusalem he said until
[51:06] don't make no difference one day five
[51:08] days nine days whatever it is stay there
[51:10] till you're filled with the spirit of
[51:12] god you see that's god's provided way
[51:15] because amen we all looking for specials
[51:17] on everything i mean in the age we are
[51:19] we're looking for a special we're
[51:20] looking for the clearance we're looking
[51:22] for the i mean you can buy the boat but
[51:24] but let's look till we can buy it
[51:25] cheaper amen amen we can buy the suit
[51:28] but let's look till we buy it cheaper
[51:29] listen we're not god's not running any
[51:32] clearance sales on a new birth
[51:34] that you're not going to cheapen this
[51:36] gospel to a handshake it'll take a death
[51:39] and it'll take a lie and it'll take a
[51:41] resurrection amen and it's no blue light
[51:44] specials amen it'll cost you the same
[51:46] thing it costs brother samuel it'll cost
[51:49] you the same thing it costs we implant
[51:51] them amen and it's a death to ourselves
[51:54] and that's god's way of doing it i know
[51:56] i know death is messy amen but it takes
[51:59] death to bring life and when a man dies
[52:02] there's a new birth a resurrection that
[52:04] god will bring upon the scene
[52:07] amen i don't care where it is or where
[52:09] it's about brother brown said it's a
[52:10] mess
[52:12] a baby born on a pile hard floored pink
[52:15] decorated hospital room it's a mess a
[52:17] burst of a calf a birth of anything is a
[52:20] mess and the new birth is nothing less
[52:23] i i would like preacher sermon sometime
[52:26] nothing less than a mess
[52:28] amen wouldn't that make a sermon title
[52:29] nothing less than a mess listen amen i
[52:32] know it's a mess but life comes out of
[52:35] it amen life sustaining life life
[52:38] that'll keep you your rest of your
[52:40] entire being when william brandon went
[52:42] through the trials of his life and lost
[52:44] his wife lost his baby
[52:46] brother man said i didn't even have one
[52:48] human reason to serve god he said god
[52:51] wouldn't talk to me and the devil did
[52:53] and he said the devil let me know i
[52:55] didn't have one human reason to serve
[52:58] god he said but down in there was a
[53:00] birth and out of that birth came the
[53:03] lord give and the lord taketh and
[53:06] blessed be the name of the lord and i
[53:08] believe tonight we might be going
[53:10] through a struggle and a hard season of
[53:12] the church of the living god but them
[53:14] that have a birth and something on the
[53:17] inside of you and said blessed is the
[53:19] name of almighty god amen i'll tell you
[53:22] this it's god's way
[53:23] it's god's way to shout yourself through
[53:25] a trial it's god's way to praise
[53:28] yourself through the walls and
[53:29] dispensations and hard times it's god's
[53:32] way he meant to wave your hand until the
[53:35] atmosphere breaks and the power of god
[53:38] comes in the church this is god's way of
[53:41] doing things i know amen i know there's
[53:43] more more eloquent ways to do it but it
[53:46] ain't god's way
[53:49] it ain't god's way
[53:50] [Music]
[53:52] no
[53:53] no i think of how brother brahm says
[53:55] that he said the new birth is nothing
[53:56] less than a mess he said but people get
[53:58] so starchy
[54:01] we'll go over and shake hands
[54:03] we'll go over there
[54:05] where they where they don't bawl and cry
[54:07] and beat on an altar and cry out
[54:10] now listen to brother brown
[54:12] you want to be too human
[54:15] but what we need is a birth a dying to
[54:17] bring forth life
[54:19] now now this is listen right here this
[54:21] will get you hey man if you
[54:23] this is a prophet saying these things
[54:25] this is what he says here he said a man
[54:27] or woman can never have a new birth
[54:29] until the intellectuals and their own
[54:31] self is rotten dead and die out
[54:35] die out at an altar
[54:37] this is what he says
[54:38] scream
[54:40] get all messed up to a place the starks
[54:43] gets out of your collar
[54:45] then you get borned again by the spirit
[54:47] of god now listen how he says it i think
[54:50] it's amazing i don't care if you squall
[54:53] speak in tongues jump up and down flop
[54:56] like a chicken with your head off
[54:59] have you ever seen no chicken flop
[55:01] around we used to cut their heads off
[55:02] and i was kids you know amen for it
[55:05] i think people probably had a more uh
[55:07] humane way to do it but you know kids
[55:09] amen
[55:11] amen my brothers they just loved it and
[55:13] the old chicken just flopped around and
[55:15] yelled ahead but it's just out there
[55:16] flopping and the prophet amen saw that
[55:19] and said that a son or daughter of god
[55:21] at the altar he don't care if you flop
[55:24] like a chicken with its head off now now
[55:26] i i don't i don't want to get into
[55:28] debates and theologically and all these
[55:31] things only thing i'm saying amen it
[55:33] seems like some people just don't read
[55:34] the quotes anymore
[55:36] if they got such a starchy intellectual
[55:39] idea of how a man comes to god you got
[55:42] to come a proper way you know sane and
[55:43] sensible and you got to shake hands
[55:45] maybe on the right side and you've got
[55:47] to do all come on church hey man since
[55:49] when did we become such a theological
[55:52] place that the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:54] is not welcome with the power and
[55:56] demonstration and the changing of
[55:59] almighty god well i'll tell you what
[56:00] amen i'd rather be dumber than a box of
[56:03] rocks and have the power of god in my
[56:05] life and to have a college education
[56:08] from every college in the country amen
[56:10] what we need is god back in the church
[56:13] we need god back in the meeting we need
[56:16] god back in the home we need god back in
[56:18] the heart and the way god comes is when
[56:21] we die to ourselves and the amen and get
[56:25] out of the mess we're in
[56:27] but we've substituted it because we want
[56:30] a classical way
[56:34] you don't think brother brown didn't
[56:36] know how to touch a spirit
[56:38] listen here he says where's thy strength
[56:40] going he said no we know the bible
[56:42] teaches the new birth but they've
[56:43] substituted for handshakes and
[56:45] everything else for the new birth but
[56:47] it'll never take the place of the new
[56:48] birth
[56:50] it's got to be an experience born again
[56:52] we all know any kind of birth is a mess
[56:56] amen it's a mess of course but it brings
[56:58] life amen now the prophet said i know
[57:01] you get it from the altar boohoo in
[57:02] and slobbering but it brings life
[57:04] it takes a starch out of you it makes
[57:07] you something you ought to be it takes
[57:09] the world and the stiff neck out of you
[57:11] isn't that beautiful brother brown was
[57:13] saying that's what we need we need to
[57:16] get humiliated in the anointing until we
[57:19] lose the starch and the stiff
[57:22] collardness and i'm somebody and i'm
[57:24] from somewhere and we're just a bunch of
[57:27] hillbillies amen they heard a prophet
[57:29] teach something and the power of god
[57:31] pulled us off amen somewhere in the
[57:33] world and made us preachers and i tell
[57:35] you this amen i'm proud of the god i
[57:37] serve come on church i am i'm proud to
[57:40] see god come down in the church and
[57:43] baptize our young people fill them with
[57:45] the anointing of god there's nothing
[57:47] greater in my life and to see god visit
[57:50] a church until the power of god strikes
[57:53] hearts and lives
[57:55] and changes the situation
[57:59] and i know we've come to that age of
[58:01] maturity people say well by the way we
[58:03] want the word well what do you think the
[58:05] word's going to produce
[58:07] y'all know where i'm going
[58:09] some of y'all could preach this sermon
[58:11] hey man brother ma'am said she she don't
[58:13] want them screaming hollering blabbering
[58:16] acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she
[58:18] thinks they are well it would certainly
[58:20] embarrass her it would ruin her educated
[58:23] ethical
[58:24] scientific society church she belongs to
[58:27] they'd throw her out at the next council
[58:28] because she can't have it she don't want
[58:30] to be pregnant with the word because
[58:32] that's the only kind this word could
[58:35] bring forth
[58:36] whoa
[58:37] oh we're just going to teach the words
[58:39] what kind of words you're teaching
[58:41] come on church i have to be i have to be
[58:43] straight honest if a teacher teaches
[58:45] this message and there's no anointing on
[58:47] it what message is he teaching because
[58:50] this is the most dynamic thing that's
[58:53] ever hit the planet earth
[58:56] come on church this is the most powerful
[58:58] thing that has ever struck the earth and
[59:01] if you can preach this message without
[59:03] somebody shouting amen i doubt you're
[59:06] preaching the message of the hour
[59:07] because this message demands an amen
[59:10] this prophet's message demands a
[59:12] hallelujah this is the word of the lord
[59:15] and just removable the cat stone has
[59:18] returned to the church shouting crying
[59:21] grace grace i can hear the bible
[59:24] prophesy and say rejoice ye o daughters
[59:26] of zion thy king cometh
[59:29] what is this message this ain't just
[59:31] some some little baptist sermon it's not
[59:34] some little church of christ sermon has
[59:36] it's the power of the resurrected jesus
[59:39] christ back in the church of the living
[59:41] god with manifestation and power and
[59:44] anointing
[59:49] now
[59:50] the prophet of god said born of the
[59:51] spirit of god it has the spirit of god
[59:53] in it
[59:55] no intellectual church joining creed
[59:57] joining bob's hair painted face there's
[59:59] no such thing at all
[1:00:01] you don't find that in the word of god
[1:00:04] but you do find
[1:00:06] an old-fashioned sanctified holy
[1:00:08] ghost-filled child born of the spirit of
[1:00:10] god screaming hotter and shouting and
[1:00:13] praising god
[1:00:15] what do you find in the word you see
[1:00:17] what the prophet's saying what they what
[1:00:19] they were trying to introduce as a god's
[1:00:22] bride brother brahm said you can't find
[1:00:24] that in the word
[1:00:26] he said but this this bunch of people
[1:00:28] who you're rejecting because they
[1:00:30] believe in the movement of the spirit of
[1:00:31] god he said i can find that in the word
[1:00:33] but i can't find that intellectual
[1:00:35] nonsense in the word of god and i'll
[1:00:37] tell you what i'm going to stand where a
[1:00:39] prophet stood
[1:00:41] amen i don't want my way i want god's
[1:00:44] way and god's way is that the holy ghost
[1:00:46] would birth the church
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:00:50] well ducks and geese or ducks and geese
[1:00:53] oh hey man
[1:00:54] you know ducks and geese no yeah i mean
[1:00:56] come on y'all hey man they've been doing
[1:00:58] it for years
[1:00:59] y'all y'all know we live here in the
[1:01:01] north and them old ducks they'll go down
[1:01:03] every south every winter
[1:01:05] they do it every winter geese will fly
[1:01:07] down every winter
[1:01:08] they'll do it every time brother brown
[1:01:10] said now you try he said you try to go
[1:01:12] cage them up and haul them down there
[1:01:15] he said god why would you want to go
[1:01:17] cage them up and hold them down there
[1:01:18] god provided a way to get them down
[1:01:20] there
[1:01:21] and do you know that god has provided
[1:01:24] that way and generation after generation
[1:01:26] after generation they do the same thing
[1:01:28] every time
[1:01:30] brother brahm said it he said he said
[1:01:32] can you imagine one fall that the duck
[1:01:35] rose up and begin to say honk honk honk
[1:01:37] he said somebody turns around says ah we
[1:01:39] don't do that anymore
[1:01:43] the ducks don't fly anymore
[1:01:46] that's that's the same as saying the
[1:01:48] church of the living god don't worship
[1:01:50] anymore the church of the living god
[1:01:52] don't feel the anointing anymore listen
[1:01:55] that's our flight path that's the
[1:01:57] pattern of the church that'll get us
[1:01:59] back in the presence of god
[1:02:02] it's the instinct is the god-given
[1:02:04] instinct now here's the beauty of it is
[1:02:06] brother ma'am said you'll not find a
[1:02:08] better way to get him down there he said
[1:02:09] matter of fact you won't find a better
[1:02:11] route for him to go
[1:02:14] won't be a better route for him to go
[1:02:16] he said you could plan it out he said
[1:02:17] but you wouldn't get them there any
[1:02:18] better than what god's got them out of
[1:02:20] there because god's got them god's got
[1:02:22] them going where he can get them around
[1:02:23] the storms
[1:02:25] he knows right where the food is he
[1:02:26] knows exactly where they can land and
[1:02:29] how they can land because it's a root
[1:02:30] now brother branham now if you i don't
[1:02:33] take time to read these things but if
[1:02:34] you go back and listen to it god's only
[1:02:36] provided flame for anything in chicago
[1:02:38] brother man will go into this point and
[1:02:40] he'll say the only way for them to get
[1:02:43] back where their ancestors went is to go
[1:02:45] god's root
[1:02:48] the church is trying to get back to an
[1:02:50] upper room experience and the only way
[1:02:53] for the church to get back where our
[1:02:55] ancestors our apostolic fathers are
[1:02:58] we've got to take the same route that
[1:03:00] they took
[1:03:02] come on y'all know i'm telling you the
[1:03:04] truth amen we brother bam said it like
[1:03:06] this he said we get up here and talk
[1:03:08] about what god was
[1:03:10] he said that ain't no different painting
[1:03:11] a picture for somebody about a fire
[1:03:14] now you know hey man i i don't know
[1:03:17] about y'all hey man but i've never been
[1:03:18] worn by painting fire
[1:03:21] i've never been burnt by painted fire
[1:03:24] hey man painting fire don't do nothing
[1:03:26] for nobody
[1:03:27] is that right amen but what we find is
[1:03:31] people today putting out the fire of god
[1:03:35] and painting a picture of the other day
[1:03:38] god used to god did god would and
[1:03:40] someday god will well i believe god is
[1:03:43] god right here tonight
[1:03:45] i believe this thursday night right here
[1:03:47] that the power of god can come into this
[1:03:50] church and birth children save children
[1:03:52] deliver children that miracles could
[1:03:54] take place in this building tonight
[1:03:56] because my god is the god of a waymaker
[1:03:59] and we have found the path that takes
[1:04:01] the church back to its apostolic father
[1:04:04] listen i'm not looking for the path
[1:04:06] tonight i found the path
[1:04:09] yeah come on church you're walking on
[1:04:12] the same trail that a prophet walked on
[1:04:15] you're walking on the same trail that
[1:04:18] enoch walked on if you keep walking this
[1:04:21] trail one of these mornings you're gonna
[1:04:23] get closer to home amen and god's going
[1:04:26] to change your body we're not looking
[1:04:29] for it we have found the redemption of
[1:04:31] the age that we have come to this is not
[1:04:34] an age where we're just hunting the will
[1:04:36] of god we've had a prophet among us
[1:04:40] we have thus
[1:04:42] saith the lord
[1:04:45] it's beautiful brother brown says you'll
[1:04:47] never find a better leader for them
[1:04:48] geese
[1:04:50] you'll never find a better leader than
[1:04:52] the one god provides
[1:04:54] god provides a leader that's the best
[1:04:56] one you can get
[1:04:57] god provided you brother samuel here in
[1:04:59] this church that's god's pastor for this
[1:05:01] for this church you'll not find a better
[1:05:03] one than the one god gave you
[1:05:05] you just ain't gonna find it if god gave
[1:05:07] him to you that's the best god's got
[1:05:11] hey man i tell you it's a powerful thing
[1:05:13] to see a church rally around the gift
[1:05:15] that god puts among them you can see
[1:05:17] supernatural you can see miraculous you
[1:05:19] can see the power of god and all you've
[1:05:21] got to do is water the word that is
[1:05:23] preached and the gift will operate and
[1:05:25] god will move into it
[1:05:27] it's god's way
[1:05:30] ah
[1:05:31] i say that because i know there are
[1:05:32] those amen
[1:05:34] who
[1:05:34] who have crept into the message and
[1:05:37] tried to take away the liberty
[1:05:38] amen press pastor shouldn't even preach
[1:05:41] anymore and you know sit down and i i
[1:05:43] guess we get our orders from some
[1:05:44] headquarters somewhere so i think
[1:05:47] prophet god said this church only got
[1:05:48] one headquarters and it's in heaven
[1:05:50] so i don't know anybody in the other
[1:05:52] headquarters
[1:05:55] come on
[1:05:56] might as well just make rome your
[1:05:57] headquarters if you're gonna have one
[1:06:00] it's the same exact
[1:06:02] spirit you might as well just bypass
[1:06:05] them and go to the big dad
[1:06:10] it's the truth
[1:06:12] you see what is going on is you can't
[1:06:14] have god's way in your way at the same
[1:06:16] time
[1:06:17] god's way is to anoint a minister and
[1:06:19] put him in the platform and preach the
[1:06:21] word of god and an anointing comes in
[1:06:24] the room and it saves and seals and
[1:06:26] delivers and heals and it's god's way i
[1:06:30] tell you i can read it from paul he said
[1:06:32] by the foolishness of preaching
[1:06:37] by the foolishness of preaching men are
[1:06:39] saved
[1:06:41] isn't it something that if god got a
[1:06:43] leader that's the best leader you can
[1:06:45] get
[1:06:46] now watch watch jesus say my sheep know
[1:06:48] my voice and a stranger they'll not
[1:06:50] follow
[1:06:51] the prophet picks this up amen and he
[1:06:54] speaks about that he says see there's
[1:06:56] not a better see you're not going to get
[1:06:57] a better leader for the geese than the
[1:06:59] one god put out in front
[1:07:00] not gonna get a better leader for the
[1:07:02] duck than the one god put out front
[1:07:04] not gonna get a better leader for the
[1:07:05] church than the one god put out front
[1:07:07] that's god's way of doing it now the
[1:07:09] prophet of god says it like this he said
[1:07:12] do you see here we are here we are 2 000
[1:07:15] years later he said and we're looking
[1:07:17] for a messiah to hold this thing
[1:07:19] together
[1:07:20] the world is looking for a leader right
[1:07:22] now to hold this world together now i
[1:07:25] don't have time to preach about the
[1:07:27] politics of this age amen but i think
[1:07:29] some people think we found the messiah
[1:07:32] amen they've got they got things the way
[1:07:34] they want them and if you're looking to
[1:07:36] bring in well well anyhow amen but but
[1:07:39] here's the thing that the world is
[1:07:41] looking for a messiah that's what
[1:07:42] they're that's what they're hunting is
[1:07:44] the messiah see but the world wants
[1:07:47] their messiah
[1:07:49] but god sends the messiah
[1:07:52] do you see that the world wants politics
[1:07:54] as a messiah they want and you can't
[1:07:56] walk in your way and god's way at the
[1:07:59] same time
[1:08:00] now there's only one leader going to
[1:08:02] bring peace to this world
[1:08:05] there's only one leader going to fix it
[1:08:06] all his name is jesus christ
[1:08:10] that's the only leader that's going to
[1:08:12] fix the problems that we have but his
[1:08:15] spirit has descended in this age to
[1:08:18] become the king of this bride before
[1:08:21] this bride ever gets to millennium
[1:08:23] listen when we get in the millennium
[1:08:24] we're not going to change presidents
[1:08:27] we're not going to change kings
[1:08:29] amen we're already under the king who
[1:08:32] will rule the new heavens and the new
[1:08:35] earth
[1:08:37] oh we are the new creation of god and
[1:08:40] every one of you is a king in the
[1:08:42] kingdom of god amen i'll show you the
[1:08:45] scripture if you want it david was a
[1:08:47] king over a band of nobodies for a long
[1:08:50] time before he was king sitting on the
[1:08:52] throne he was anointed of god and they
[1:08:54] followed him because he was a coming
[1:08:56] king but they never changed kings when
[1:08:59] they anointed david on the throne of
[1:09:00] jerusalem their king coming to power he
[1:09:03] had always been their king and jesus
[1:09:06] christ is the king of the saints tonight
[1:09:09] amen in one of these days
[1:09:12] they're going to put him in power and my
[1:09:14] king is coming in power in the
[1:09:16] millennium brother yes sir i'm a jesus
[1:09:19] man yes i'm a jesus freak i believe in
[1:09:22] the corporal body of jesus christ i
[1:09:25] believe in nelshart hands
[1:09:28] i believe in the physical return of our
[1:09:31] lord jesus where he'll set up a lineal
[1:09:33] reign upon the earth yes i believe that
[1:09:37] yes i believe that but he his spirit is
[1:09:40] here tonight
[1:09:43] it's here as a king
[1:09:46] brother man said they're looking for a
[1:09:47] messiah to hold a thing together they're
[1:09:48] praying for a messiah paragraph 130. but
[1:09:51] here's what i want to say if he would
[1:09:53] come would we receive him
[1:09:55] would we do like they did and refuse him
[1:09:58] what we must realize skipping down we
[1:10:00] must realize and do not understand what
[1:10:03] we need we think we do but god promised
[1:10:05] to supply our need and he'll do it
[1:10:08] so the world gets to thinking what we
[1:10:10] need to lead
[1:10:11] and god says he'll give you what you
[1:10:13] need
[1:10:14] do you see god ain't giving you what you
[1:10:16] want he's giving you what you need
[1:10:18] amen and what we need was a messiah
[1:10:21] that's what we needed
[1:10:22] and the prophet of god said they're
[1:10:23] praying for messiah they want a messiah
[1:10:25] that's what it is they want a messiah
[1:10:28] in paragraph 133 he said see what it is
[1:10:31] he said they'll do it again the same
[1:10:33] thing today they'd refuse it again if
[1:10:35] god sent the messiah they'll refuse it
[1:10:38] because it don't come their way
[1:10:42] they don't come the way they want it so
[1:10:43] they just don't take it
[1:10:45] we want a messiah so the messiah comes
[1:10:47] and they won't wash his feet
[1:10:50] do you see what it is that very request
[1:10:52] brother graham said ask before god
[1:10:54] god sent it to us and we refuse
[1:10:56] it falling apart world falling apart
[1:10:59] brother braham said what we need today
[1:11:01] is a message
[1:11:02] see we see what he says what we need
[1:11:06] maybe not what we want what we need
[1:11:08] is a message anointed with the
[1:11:11] messiahship of christ
[1:11:13] he said but would they receive it they
[1:11:14] pray for it but would they receive it no
[1:11:16] sir they wouldn't receive it they would
[1:11:18] crucify like they did in the first place
[1:11:21] now today the crucifixion's not taking
[1:11:23] place at calvary it's taken place in the
[1:11:26] pulpits because they're crucifying the
[1:11:29] effect of the messiah that is here to
[1:11:32] lead by his word
[1:11:36] brother brahm says it i i think these
[1:11:38] are powerful quotes he said we cry for
[1:11:40] such a person god would send us a
[1:11:41] deliverance but we've got to receive it
[1:11:43] in the way that he sends it they didn't
[1:11:46] do it they didn't want it that way the
[1:11:48] church cries oh heavenly father will you
[1:11:50] please send jesus to us will you please
[1:11:54] and when the holy spirit begins to move
[1:11:57] they don't want it
[1:11:59] will you send jesus but when the holy
[1:12:02] spirit begins to move they don't want it
[1:12:04] come on y'all know that jesus in john 14
[1:12:07] he said yet a little while
[1:12:09] and the world see me no more but you
[1:12:11] will see me for i will be with you even
[1:12:14] in you now it sounds like it's different
[1:12:17] than the holy ghost because in john 14
[1:12:19] he begins by saying i'll go away and
[1:12:21] he'll come unto you
[1:12:23] the spirit of truth and he'll comfort
[1:12:25] you it's the way he says it but then he
[1:12:26] turns around and says for i'll go away
[1:12:28] and then i'll come again
[1:12:30] and i'll be with you even in you so
[1:12:33] we're not trinitarians
[1:12:36] we believe in one god
[1:12:38] and that one god is jesus christ and his
[1:12:41] spirit is here tonight so when you
[1:12:44] receive the holy ghost you're not
[1:12:45] receiving a different jesus
[1:12:48] you're receiving jesus christ in the
[1:12:50] spirit of his resurrection
[1:12:53] that's exactly how paul met him
[1:12:56] paul never met him in the flesh but he
[1:12:58] met him in the after and the
[1:13:00] resurrection as a pillar of fire and he
[1:13:02] said lord who are you said i am jesus
[1:13:06] who is this among us then this great
[1:13:08] pillar of fire who is this among us that
[1:13:11] has visited our generation who is this
[1:13:13] that comes down and moves through our
[1:13:15] sanctuaries on a thursday night and
[1:13:18] stirs our heart to an amen to a
[1:13:20] hallelujah to a glory to god who is this
[1:13:24] i tell you who it is it's none other
[1:13:26] than jesus christ the son of god and i
[1:13:28] say that he's not dead tonight i say
[1:13:31] that he's alive and resurrected power is
[1:13:35] here in this building tonight
[1:13:37] then we've not received just a spirit
[1:13:40] whereby we're going to try to make
[1:13:41] things happen and we're going to try to
[1:13:43] build things up listen the spirit we
[1:13:45] have received has already conquered hell
[1:13:48] the spirit that i've got has already
[1:13:50] conquered every disease he's conquered
[1:13:52] every temptation he raised up on the
[1:13:55] third day and after 2
[1:13:57] 000 years he is still conquering
[1:14:00] diseases and demons and powers and he's
[1:14:03] right here in the house tonight i say we
[1:14:06] are to wake up jesus we are to wake him
[1:14:09] up tonight and say god we need you in
[1:14:12] the church
[1:14:13] we need him tonight
[1:14:16] brother ram said some people are looking
[1:14:17] for a messiah he said it's not some man
[1:14:19] here the messiah he said it's the spirit
[1:14:22] of god
[1:14:26] then the messiah is here then you
[1:14:28] already go tell your friends come see
[1:14:30] one
[1:14:31] we have found the messiah
[1:14:35] [Applause]
[1:14:36] not by might
[1:14:38] not by power
[1:14:40] but by my spirit saith the lord that's
[1:14:43] why paul said that where the spirit of
[1:14:46] the lord is there is liberty
[1:14:49] and the lord is that spirit
[1:14:53] it's not a different spirit
[1:14:55] and the bible even says that if the same
[1:14:57] spirit that raised up jesus from the
[1:14:59] dead dwelling you will also quicken
[1:15:03] will also quicken your mortal body than
[1:15:05] receiving the holy ghost as an anointing
[1:15:07] as a spirit then has to deal with your
[1:15:10] body change
[1:15:11] you can't have a body change without an
[1:15:14] experience with the anointing of
[1:15:16] almighty god
[1:15:19] hey man now people ain't going to
[1:15:20] receive it
[1:15:22] amen but just as it was in that day they
[1:15:25] didn't receive it there was somebody to
[1:15:27] receive it
[1:15:28] and it might have been a little hooker
[1:15:31] who has had a whale
[1:15:32] but she had a seed in her that when the
[1:15:34] messiah come something in her recognized
[1:15:37] that's a messiah
[1:15:38] peter couldn't write his name in boxcar
[1:15:41] letters he was just an old fisherman but
[1:15:43] when the messiah come he recognized it
[1:15:46] was him philip recognized nathanael
[1:15:49] recognized and i believe there's people
[1:15:52] sitting in this building tonight that
[1:15:54] have recognized the messiah has come
[1:15:56] into this earth to lead this bride and
[1:15:59] exodus
[1:16:01] they ain't a better leader god ain't got
[1:16:02] a better leader than the holy ghost and
[1:16:04] the holy ghost is the anointing on the
[1:16:06] word that is coming to this age i know
[1:16:09] people people go on this all the time i
[1:16:11] i've been called pentecost in the last
[1:16:13] five years more hey man i don't know why
[1:16:15] they just keep calling me pentecostal i
[1:16:16] know what the problem is i've never been
[1:16:18] in pentecost in my life
[1:16:20] i never ever ever ever was in a
[1:16:22] pentecostal church i don't know why they
[1:16:24] call me pentecostal
[1:16:26] listen can i just set the record
[1:16:27] straight amen i did preach in
[1:16:29] pentecostals church one time and i'll
[1:16:31] tell you what happened i was in the back
[1:16:33] room and they were shouting and dancing
[1:16:36] after songs but the minute i come out
[1:16:38] and opened up the word that was one of
[1:16:40] the quietest bunch of people you ever
[1:16:41] heard
[1:16:42] i have never seen pentecostals shout on
[1:16:45] the revelation of seven thunders i have
[1:16:47] never seen pentecostals child over the
[1:16:50] preaching of seven seals i have never
[1:16:52] seen pentecostals shout about eating a
[1:16:55] book and translating power and malachi 4
[1:16:58] but there's something on the inside of
[1:17:00] you that when you hear the message
[1:17:03] preached you can't hardly set in your
[1:17:05] seat because you're not a pentecostal
[1:17:08] you're a son and daughter of god and
[1:17:10] it's god's provided way that when christ
[1:17:13] comes into the building you make known
[1:17:15] that he is there
[1:17:17] [Applause]
[1:17:20] i'll tell you what if he would come
[1:17:22] today brother said he'd be a word of god
[1:17:24] manifested word of god a vindicated word
[1:17:26] of god
[1:17:27] that's the messiah
[1:17:29] that's the messiah hey man what is it
[1:17:31] don't make any mistakes about it friends
[1:17:34] it's not what i'm saying it's i'm just
[1:17:36] your brother but it's what god has
[1:17:38] proven to you that makes it the truth
[1:17:40] the same pillar fire he used for the
[1:17:42] other two he's brought it among you
[1:17:44] today and proved it by scientific proof
[1:17:46] two exodus is under a pillar of fire and
[1:17:49] here we are today in the third exodus
[1:17:51] and the messiah is here to lead it
[1:17:55] oh god ain't got two ways he did it that
[1:17:59] way the first time he's doing it that
[1:18:01] way this time and let me tell you this
[1:18:03] if you can sit under the pillar of fire
[1:18:05] and have no emotions amen then there's
[1:18:07] something going on with you amen but
[1:18:09] when it comes to me i'm sorry i i just
[1:18:12] have to be honest as something on the
[1:18:14] inside of me and the supercharge of the
[1:18:17] anointing of god begins to move over me
[1:18:19] it moves my insides
[1:18:23] now you label that anything you want i
[1:18:25] don't know
[1:18:28] you can tag a you can take a roast beef
[1:18:30] ham if you want to
[1:18:33] but anybody knows what they're looking
[1:18:35] at knows the difference
[1:18:37] oh the preacher doesn't even get in the
[1:18:39] house
[1:18:40] some people don't know the difference do
[1:18:41] they don't know they only know what
[1:18:42] they're looking at you know what's
[1:18:44] amazing to me brother brown said that
[1:18:46] about when those school of prophets was
[1:18:48] up there with elisha he said he went up
[1:18:49] there and they was going to make a
[1:18:50] pottage for him to eat he said and they
[1:18:52] went out and gathered and some got peas
[1:18:55] and some got gourds he said the fella
[1:18:57] that put the gourds in the pot like to
[1:18:59] kill the whole bunch
[1:19:00] he said because he didn't know the
[1:19:02] difference between peas and gourds
[1:19:04] he said ain't no different today he said
[1:19:07] than preachers that don't know the
[1:19:08] difference between fanaticism and the
[1:19:11] move of the holy ghost
[1:19:12] amen and they call everything fanaticism
[1:19:16] but the prophet of god said don't throw
[1:19:18] the whole pot away he said elisha added
[1:19:20] some christ to it and fix the whole pot
[1:19:23] and i tell you what we need we can have
[1:19:25] our emotions but let's put christ in it
[1:19:28] we can have our dances we can have a
[1:19:30] holy ghost move let's put christ in it
[1:19:34] i can tell the difference
[1:19:38] i can tell the difference
[1:19:40] and any anybody got the holy ghost can
[1:19:42] discern the difference
[1:19:44] god's system is the holy spirit and the
[1:19:46] word that's god's system
[1:19:48] what he's offered you is a kingdom not a
[1:19:50] denomination
[1:19:52] he's offered you a kingdom where the
[1:19:53] word of god has power
[1:19:55] where it has power to change your life
[1:19:57] it has power to create atmosphere it has
[1:20:00] power to set you into the angels
[1:20:03] dimensions and and puts wings under you
[1:20:05] fly you out of the darkness this this
[1:20:08] word has power in this kingdom
[1:20:10] if you're born in the kingdom of god
[1:20:12] this word has power to change things
[1:20:15] it's a powerful thing when you're in
[1:20:17] this kingdom
[1:20:19] god has offered this people a kingdom
[1:20:21] now you're in hebrews 12 remember for we
[1:20:23] have received a kingdom
[1:20:25] but we have received a kingdom that
[1:20:26] shall not be shaken and that kingdom
[1:20:29] we've received is the word it's god's
[1:20:31] system it's god's word given by a
[1:20:34] vindicated prophet
[1:20:37] let the kingdom come
[1:20:39] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[1:20:42] heaven let the kingdom of god come to us
[1:20:46] come on church you know it's right for
[1:20:48] the kingdom of god is without
[1:20:49] observation i say not here or there but
[1:20:52] it's within you
[1:20:54] that's why william branham would stand
[1:20:55] there and say i'll take every spirit in
[1:20:57] this building under my control because
[1:20:59] the kingdom of god had came to the earth
[1:21:03] a messiah
[1:21:04] a messiah's kingdom that's why the
[1:21:07] anointing here in this building tonight
[1:21:09] is stronger than ever depression it's
[1:21:11] stronger than every anxiety it's
[1:21:13] stronger than ever failure in your life
[1:21:15] i know it's just the thursday nights but
[1:21:17] the messiah is here in the building
[1:21:20] tonight he's here to change hearts he's
[1:21:22] here to change lives it's the anointed
[1:21:25] word that's come in our midst again
[1:21:28] and i'll tell you this when he begins to
[1:21:30] move that's why a prophet could stand
[1:21:31] there and say every demon is under my
[1:21:34] control
[1:21:36] that's why that maniac runned up there
[1:21:38] to whip brother branham and the spirit
[1:21:40] come out of it and he fell across
[1:21:41] brother man's feet your brother brown
[1:21:43] said you ought to sing the healings and
[1:21:44] the miracles take place the next few
[1:21:46] days because the chief devil had been
[1:21:48] whipped
[1:21:51] i tell you what this message with the
[1:21:53] chief devil it whipped the devil into
[1:21:55] nomination amen it with the devils amen
[1:21:58] in the in the kingdom can i say it like
[1:22:01] this william branham slayed the goliath
[1:22:03] so that the church of the living god can
[1:22:06] fight this battle and i don't know about
[1:22:08] y'all i'm not putting down my sword
[1:22:14] hey we got him on the run
[1:22:16] we might as well take him after him
[1:22:19] if one could tell you a thousand
[1:22:22] two complete ten thousand what a little
[1:22:24] church like this dude tonight
[1:22:26] i'll tell you what they're running
[1:22:28] sirens in hell right now
[1:22:32] they running sirens in hell right now
[1:22:34] she's waking up there's something going
[1:22:37] on up there on that thursday y'all hurry
[1:22:38] up get up there y'all do something you
[1:22:40] got to stop this but i'm gonna i want to
[1:22:42] put a news flash out to the devil i want
[1:22:45] to sound the trumpet i want them to hear
[1:22:47] me all the way in hell you will never
[1:22:49] stop this you will never stop what has
[1:22:51] been started amen god said i have begun
[1:22:54] to work and i am the finisher of the
[1:22:57] work
[1:22:58] this is the finishers here tonight the
[1:23:00] finisher of this anointing is here he
[1:23:03] has come himself to lead us out of this
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:08] brother man said anything that pulls you
[1:23:10] out of the way is a false anointing
[1:23:12] anything that pulls you away from that
[1:23:14] is wrong
[1:23:16] that's a false messiah a false anointing
[1:23:19] somebody said oh that brother had an
[1:23:20] anointing he said what kind of anointing
[1:23:23] he said that's it hitler had an
[1:23:25] anointing khrushchev got one also pope
[1:23:27] plus has one he said also what kind of
[1:23:30] anointing you got if it's not anointed
[1:23:32] with the word to vindicate every word to
[1:23:34] be true leave it alone
[1:23:36] now that's how you know the difference
[1:23:39] when the anointing is moving because of
[1:23:41] the word it's not emotionalism amen it's
[1:23:45] not fanaticism it's the anointed word
[1:23:48] coming to the earth to birth lives
[1:23:53] to change hearts
[1:23:55] now y'all know
[1:23:57] y'all know how satan built his kingdom
[1:23:59] don't you
[1:24:00] how did he do it he he brought another
[1:24:02] idea
[1:24:03] into god's kingdom brother braham said
[1:24:04] by his fallen angels he led them he led
[1:24:07] them out isaiah saw it and isaiah said
[1:24:10] why thy father from heaven oh lucifer
[1:24:12] remember that brother bam said he said
[1:24:14] for thou have said in thine heart so
[1:24:16] when isaiah wrote about
[1:24:19] satan fallen brother brahm said he was
[1:24:21] looking at the heart of satan he was
[1:24:24] seeing a vision of what he wanted to be
[1:24:28] but when paul wrote about it in ii
[1:24:29] thessalonians
[1:24:31] paul said he said thou have ascended
[1:24:33] thyself above the throne of god and
[1:24:36] brother man said he's there in position
[1:24:38] now
[1:24:39] paul is putting him in position now now
[1:24:41] he's ascended himself above all that's
[1:24:43] called god
[1:24:44] now somebody said what's called god then
[1:24:46] what do you call god brother brahm said
[1:24:47] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:24:48] was with god the word was god he said
[1:24:50] then the word vindicated anything that
[1:24:53] exalts itself above it is the kingdom of
[1:24:56] hell
[1:24:57] see anything that comes in and says well
[1:24:59] brother branham taught it but i don't
[1:25:01] really believe this or i don't think
[1:25:02] this is right or i don't think we ought
[1:25:04] to be this way that's the kingdom of
[1:25:06] hell coming against the church but i
[1:25:08] tell you what he meant somebody needs to
[1:25:10] open up the door and let the devil out
[1:25:12] of the building tonight because his
[1:25:13] kingdom is coming down as the men of god
[1:25:17] that is left on this earth that's going
[1:25:19] to tell the church of the living god the
[1:25:21] kingdom of god is risen up in this age
[1:25:24] by the prophet of god has brought a word
[1:25:27] and that word is here to rule supreme in
[1:25:29] every heart every family every church
[1:25:31] every life that's what gives the church
[1:25:34] its authority back it's god's
[1:25:36] oh
[1:25:37] it's god's way
[1:25:39] come on friends it's god's way somebody
[1:25:40] says well i'm going to get this and i'm
[1:25:42] going to study that and i'm going to get
[1:25:44] that it's not god's way
[1:25:46] god's way is to send the prophet that
[1:25:48] word is spoken and the bride exceeds it
[1:25:51] and they have received a messiahship
[1:25:55] so preacher what are you talking about
[1:25:56] i'm talking about this god gives us a
[1:25:59] way to everything we've lost
[1:26:02] god gave us away
[1:26:04] your bible reader how many bible
[1:26:05] readings we got here tonight you know
[1:26:07] what it says in second corinthians
[1:26:09] you remember that when it says being
[1:26:11] that we have this ministry we faint not
[1:26:14] remember that because it didn't come
[1:26:15] with us with declaration of words but
[1:26:17] through manifestation
[1:26:19] it's what it says amen and it tells us
[1:26:22] that the gospel if it's hid
[1:26:25] it is hidden to them that are lost
[1:26:28] he says unless they would take amen
[1:26:32] unless they would take the gospel
[1:26:34] brother man picks it up and says that
[1:26:35] last l-e-s-t he says exactly what
[1:26:38] happened in the garden of eden when adam
[1:26:40] and eve fell he said god put angels
[1:26:43] around the tree of life
[1:26:45] to protect the way
[1:26:49] the way of the tree of life was blocked
[1:26:52] because god said no man would enter back
[1:26:54] into this way he said did i make an
[1:26:56] atonement for it so he blocked the way
[1:26:59] so they couldn't get to it so what we
[1:27:01] find is those four anointings that were
[1:27:03] around the way of the tree of life with
[1:27:05] a man ox eagle amen they were the lion
[1:27:08] the man the ox and the eagle is that
[1:27:10] right amen and now brother branham says
[1:27:13] the swords that used to hold us out from
[1:27:15] the tree of life are now leading us back
[1:27:19] to the tree of life
[1:27:21] then there's an eagle that has come into
[1:27:23] this age to open up the way and the tree
[1:27:27] of life that the church can return to
[1:27:30] the former glory listen to me we're
[1:27:32] going back to eden church
[1:27:34] this message has taken you back to eden
[1:27:37] conditions
[1:27:39] i know people think i'm insane but
[1:27:41] that's all right let me i'm happy like i
[1:27:42] am
[1:27:44] so it's not eden it's not you helped me
[1:27:46] understand that how william branham
[1:27:48] could stand there and he that's in you
[1:27:50] and tell the storms to go back and the
[1:27:52] sun to shine for three days and while
[1:27:54] he's standing there animals are obeying
[1:27:57] his voice
[1:27:59] he said i'm standing in timber that's
[1:28:01] never been touched it was virgin timber
[1:28:04] it was a garden he was speaking to the
[1:28:06] animals he said then i was young and
[1:28:09] there was my wife she was young again he
[1:28:12] was walking in the condition
[1:28:16] hallelujah and the church of the living
[1:28:18] god is on the same trail we're walking
[1:28:22] the same road
[1:28:28] i
[1:28:29] i not lost my mind
[1:28:30] i ain't amen how come he could tell them
[1:28:33] bees to go back into the nest
[1:28:36] had the first nature they wouldn't have
[1:28:38] touched him
[1:28:39] in the garden of eden them bees wouldn't
[1:28:41] have touched him but the minute there
[1:28:42] was a fallen nature they wanted to get
[1:28:44] after him but he had a condition that
[1:28:47] put him back in the same premises and he
[1:28:50] told him to go
[1:28:52] hey that's open to ever believe in this
[1:28:54] building
[1:28:55] that's not just for a prophet he made
[1:28:58] the way that the church could walk
[1:29:00] therein
[1:29:03] hey
[1:29:04] as she begins to walk in that way
[1:29:07] god has a way if you like to read your
[1:29:08] bibles revelation 22 the bible actually
[1:29:11] says that we have a right to the tree of
[1:29:13] life
[1:29:14] we have a right to the tree of life how
[1:29:17] did god restore my goodness i'm going to
[1:29:19] get out of time for get out of sermon
[1:29:21] how do we restore the church how do we
[1:29:23] get the church back god's got a way to
[1:29:25] do it you say i've lost so much god's
[1:29:28] got a way to give it back
[1:29:30] but you've got to come god's way of
[1:29:32] doing it
[1:29:34] now
[1:29:35] okay are you all right we don't preacher
[1:29:37] you'll want me i can stop right here if
[1:29:39] you want me to
[1:29:41] god's got a way
[1:29:43] god's got a way to do it
[1:29:45] let me just y'all's gentiles you're
[1:29:47] gentile people
[1:29:48] so you have to have representation in
[1:29:50] the bible and that's a gentile woman do
[1:29:52] y'all know ruth is one of your
[1:29:53] representatives
[1:29:55] so you are ruth how many knows brother
[1:29:57] bram said every parable in the bible is
[1:29:58] being manifest now
[1:30:00] so you're not just going to be ruth
[1:30:02] you're going to be sheba you're not just
[1:30:03] sheba you're going to be rahab you're
[1:30:05] not just rahab you're going to be tamar
[1:30:06] you're not just tam are you going to be
[1:30:08] mary you're not just you you see that
[1:30:10] you're going to be shamgar you're going
[1:30:14] every word is how you live in this age
[1:30:17] you're going to pick up an oxnard in one
[1:30:19] day and you just got to believe the word
[1:30:21] and the next day
[1:30:22] all of the bible has been open to this
[1:30:24] bride
[1:30:25] [Music]
[1:30:27] so brother wayne i've lost so much how
[1:30:28] did i get it all back how did ruth get
[1:30:30] it
[1:30:31] how did ruth get it she had a kinsmen
[1:30:32] redeemer that was god's way to give her
[1:30:37] back what she had lost
[1:30:39] her fallen estate when she returned with
[1:30:42] her mother-in-law they went to they was
[1:30:44] poor they didn't have anything they
[1:30:45] returned without the ability to help
[1:30:48] themselves and the only thing she could
[1:30:50] do was glean the field that's all she
[1:30:52] could do glean in the field
[1:30:54] hey man but what she did was she got in
[1:30:56] the right field
[1:30:59] she got right field
[1:31:01] and the bible said boaz descended into
[1:31:04] the field one day while she's working
[1:31:07] ah that's too much to preach isn't there
[1:31:09] come on we've had a boaz descend in this
[1:31:12] age
[1:31:13] while we're working in the field boaz
[1:31:16] come riding on the vindicated word of
[1:31:18] god and saw a bride
[1:31:22] virtuous bride
[1:31:25] come to find out
[1:31:26] we was kin to him
[1:31:29] remember remember remember that naomi
[1:31:32] hey man she owned property but it had
[1:31:34] been sold out and she had lost it in the
[1:31:37] in the holocaust but she's returning now
[1:31:40] amen but before she ever left moses
[1:31:43] wrote a law
[1:31:44] that gave a person a way to get it all
[1:31:47] back
[1:31:49] you couldn't get it back any other way
[1:31:52] but if you come god's way it wouldn't
[1:31:54] even cost you anything
[1:31:57] if you come god's way he just gives it
[1:32:00] back to you
[1:32:02] remember remember finally ruth starts
[1:32:05] talking to naomi and come to find out
[1:32:06] the field she's working in is the
[1:32:08] kinsmen of naomi and she says to her she
[1:32:11] says we this man can redeem us this man
[1:32:14] can put us back into our he can give us
[1:32:16] back everything that we lost everything
[1:32:18] that we have been out all this beautiful
[1:32:20] things are ours and we can't have it but
[1:32:22] our names on it we just can't get it but
[1:32:24] this man can give it all back
[1:32:27] this man can fix all your problems
[1:32:30] she said what i do said this is the way
[1:32:32] you do it remember center up there at
[1:32:34] the harvest and get at the feet of boaz
[1:32:36] and ask to be redeemed
[1:32:38] ask him to ask him and when she did she
[1:32:41] laid at the feet brother bram said which
[1:32:42] represented the cross
[1:32:45] how did she know what to do she asked
[1:32:47] naomi
[1:32:49] now you know what brother graham said
[1:32:50] about that don't you he said naomi was
[1:32:52] the old testament scripture he said so
[1:32:54] if you'll ask the old testament it'll
[1:32:56] give you the law of redemption
[1:32:59] so the old testament teaches us how to
[1:33:01] be redeemed by the law so that god's way
[1:33:04] works for us not against us that's one
[1:33:08] time it's good to be under the law
[1:33:10] church when the law is giving you back
[1:33:13] everything you're lost come on bridetree
[1:33:16] you know where i'm at there's a
[1:33:17] restoration time and the holy ghost law
[1:33:21] is here to enforce that everything you
[1:33:23] lost
[1:33:28] i tell you what naomi did she instructed
[1:33:30] her how to get it all back amen and
[1:33:32] remember what he did he said i'll do it
[1:33:35] i'll redeem you give her six six bars
[1:33:37] six uh six sheets of barley send her
[1:33:39] back she goes back down to the house and
[1:33:41] he says says dude naomi's damn one says
[1:33:44] what did he say to you he said he'd do
[1:33:45] it
[1:33:46] she said he'd do it he said he'll do it
[1:33:48] what i do now nothing
[1:33:52] what do you do now nothing
[1:33:54] what do you mean nothing he said this is
[1:33:56] the time you rest
[1:33:58] because he won't rest until the thing is
[1:34:00] finished let me tell you something
[1:34:02] tonight amen it's time for the bride to
[1:34:05] rest in the word and realize that god
[1:34:08] will not stop until we have received
[1:34:11] everything that's been lost our bodies
[1:34:13] are to be restored our joy is to be
[1:34:16] responsible our life is to be restored
[1:34:18] and look at the beauty of this they
[1:34:20] didn't have nothing
[1:34:22] they had lost it all but he could give
[1:34:25] it all back
[1:34:27] because god has a way to do it
[1:34:31] i tell you it's a powerful thing
[1:34:33] this is this is powerful i'm just going
[1:34:35] to paraphrase instead of reading the
[1:34:36] scripture to you but but the way you do
[1:34:38] that is boaz had to actually testify
[1:34:41] before the elders
[1:34:42] so he takes ten elders and goes out to
[1:34:44] the gate of the city stands in the gate
[1:34:47] and begins to tell them that naomi is my
[1:34:50] kinsman and this is her daughter-in-law
[1:34:52] and i'm going to redeem her and marry
[1:34:53] this woman
[1:34:55] and now he had to tell
[1:34:57] 10 elders the law and when he got done
[1:35:01] they had to admit he's met the
[1:35:03] requirement of the law
[1:35:05] so when those elders got done you know
[1:35:07] what they would say they would say
[1:35:08] worthy
[1:35:10] you are worthy of her to be her kinsmen
[1:35:13] he said preacher why are you on that
[1:35:15] because in revelation the fifth chapter
[1:35:18] the act of redemption in the end time is
[1:35:21] brother branham says the lamb will take
[1:35:23] the book he said and the first act of
[1:35:26] redemption is he testifies to the 24
[1:35:29] elders of his kinsmanship to this bride
[1:35:33] so 24 elders are sitting there in heaven
[1:35:36] and jesus is testifying to them as boaz
[1:35:39] did in the old testament and he's saying
[1:35:41] they're my kinsmen i've gave my blood
[1:35:43] for them i am their kinsmen i am i am
[1:35:47] fulfilling the law come on church he
[1:35:50] didn't cheat the law he fulfilled the
[1:35:52] law and you know what those elders said
[1:35:54] 24 of them 12 of the old 12 of the new
[1:35:57] you know what all the elders said they
[1:35:59] said worthy
[1:36:02] worthy he's worthy he's worthy to pay
[1:36:06] the price of our redemption tonight he's
[1:36:08] worthy that the blood of jesus christ
[1:36:11] can give you back everything that he
[1:36:12] promised listen adam forfeited it but
[1:36:15] jesus has given it back he's provided a
[1:36:17] way to give it back
[1:36:19] this message is returning to you
[1:36:21] everything that's been lost
[1:36:26] to accept this word is to recept all of
[1:36:29] your inheritance it's to receive the
[1:36:31] inheritance of the word and to be put
[1:36:33] back into the hands of the church the
[1:36:35] forfeited title deed of redemption
[1:36:38] meaning that legal possession now is
[1:36:40] back in the hands of the believers god
[1:36:43] gave you the word legally and i'm a
[1:36:46] legal holder tonight meaning i can tell
[1:36:49] the devil get off of my property i am a
[1:36:53] legal owner of this possession
[1:36:58] the preacher what are you trying to say
[1:36:59] i'm trying to say god made a way
[1:37:02] how god's way to do it is he used boaz
[1:37:06] god's way to save man he put jesus at
[1:37:09] calvary and his blood run that was god's
[1:37:12] way man's looking and said that's not
[1:37:14] salvation but it was god's salvation
[1:37:17] jehovah's elected salvation to save us
[1:37:21] was jesus christ this is god's way of
[1:37:24] saving
[1:37:25] you can try any way you want but that's
[1:37:27] god's way to do it
[1:37:28] he said well i want to be restored any
[1:37:30] way to be restored outside of a
[1:37:32] prophetic word it's not god's way
[1:37:36] so i got to accept this prophet if you
[1:37:38] want restoration
[1:37:40] if you want to be put back where you
[1:37:42] come from
[1:37:44] this word will put you back
[1:37:46] where you come from it'll put you back
[1:37:48] you know what it's actually done
[1:37:50] it's it's gave us
[1:37:52] it's gave us a very beautiful how could
[1:37:55] i say this it's give us a very beautiful
[1:37:57] position as a church
[1:37:59] in that we're living in a very difficult
[1:38:01] age
[1:38:02] but we're literally being placed before
[1:38:05] the pillar of fire
[1:38:06] like moses was
[1:38:08] like job was
[1:38:10] like abraham was
[1:38:12] which gave every one of them a
[1:38:14] disposition of perseverance
[1:38:17] is that right
[1:38:18] then the church of the living god has
[1:38:21] heard the voice of god
[1:38:23] in the presence of god
[1:38:26] and now they're ready to go forward in
[1:38:28] this marching battle
[1:38:30] now i'm going to say that because if you
[1:38:32] know you're in the line of duty if you
[1:38:35] have received god's way and you're
[1:38:37] walking in this way a position is going
[1:38:40] to come but that doesn't mean that
[1:38:42] you're out of the way that means satan's
[1:38:44] trying to block the way
[1:38:47] is that right
[1:38:49] but listen i want you to i want you to
[1:38:50] know that when moses was leading the
[1:38:52] children of israel
[1:38:54] and he was going to the promised land he
[1:38:56] was right in god's way
[1:38:59] and he had a entire army behind him
[1:39:03] and he had a red sea in front of him now
[1:39:05] y'all got to ask somebody why did god
[1:39:08] put a man in a pickle like that
[1:39:11] you're gonna ask somebody why did god do
[1:39:13] that why would god put a man in that
[1:39:16] kind of place
[1:39:17] why would he do it why would god put an
[1:39:19] entire army behind a man and put a red
[1:39:22] sea in front of a man and him in charge
[1:39:25] of two million people women kids and
[1:39:27] animals and everything else and looked
[1:39:29] like he was just easy pickings brother
[1:39:31] man said god put him in that place to
[1:39:34] prove to you he's a god that makes a way
[1:39:37] when there is no way he made
[1:39:42] he made a way
[1:39:44] when there was no way
[1:39:47] but he's god and he still makes his way
[1:39:49] i tell you something tonight you may be
[1:39:51] facing things that you don't think you
[1:39:53] can get through but you don't know the
[1:39:55] kind of gods you're serving you don't
[1:39:57] realize the power of the god you're
[1:40:00] serving tonight he can open red seas he
[1:40:02] can tear down walls he can move
[1:40:05] mountains he can change bodies he can
[1:40:08] cause every devil to dissipate at the
[1:40:11] power of the word of god i tell you
[1:40:13] something tonight my god is a wave maker
[1:40:16] and he's here to make a way for you
[1:40:19] you're sitting here tonight saying
[1:40:20] brother wayne i'm fighting with
[1:40:22] everything that's in me just keep
[1:40:23] fighting because god will make a way you
[1:40:25] don't think there is but there is a way
[1:40:27] through it and god has provided the way
[1:40:29] through it
[1:40:31] you follow this word and god will make a
[1:40:33] hole in the wall
[1:40:35] he'll make a he'll make a he'll make the
[1:40:37] door open when there is no door open
[1:40:41] i ever tell you about me and brother
[1:40:42] isaac overnight in india
[1:40:44] brother isaac vasuku tomorrow lizard and
[1:40:46] chennai and he he has a he had a he had
[1:40:49] a nice home but his church got so big he
[1:40:52] just turned the church over to the to
[1:40:54] the to the people and and so they're
[1:40:56] they're just living in that well he went
[1:40:57] and bought this little apartment he's
[1:40:59] got he's got three children and and some
[1:41:01] of them's already having children his
[1:41:02] wife and then himself and then i think
[1:41:04] his mom or something or his dad and
[1:41:06] there was a bunch of them so they had
[1:41:07] this one apartment well it wasn't big
[1:41:09] enough for the family so what they did
[1:41:10] is a lot of times in india the whole
[1:41:12] family
[1:41:13] lived together which if you can get away
[1:41:15] with that's good for me but but they
[1:41:18] were living there and so he went and
[1:41:21] rented he owned that when he rented that
[1:41:23] to somebody else and he went and rented
[1:41:25] a bigger apartment and they were all
[1:41:26] living but it was further from the
[1:41:27] church
[1:41:28] so somebody owned the apartment is it
[1:41:31] called adjacent it's just next door he
[1:41:34] they lived just the other side of the
[1:41:35] wall somebody owned that apartment so he
[1:41:37] talked to me into getting a lease

[2:08:39] the rest
[2:08:40] and lord
[2:08:42] she received that promise
[2:08:45] what power was in that promise that god
[2:08:48] was able to draw her away from looking
[2:08:50] to herself
[2:08:52] from looking at her unworthiness to
[2:08:54] where god there was a confidence within
[2:08:56] that word

[2:18:20] hallelujah
[2:18:23] amen how many have enjoyed the word of
[2:18:25] the lord tonight
[2:18:27] amen
[2:18:30] it's grace in this hour
[2:18:32] that god has come
[2:18:35] shoutings of grace
[2:18:38] grace
[2:18:39] unto it
[2:18:43] it calls us beyond all reason
[2:18:47] our reasons fail
[2:18:49] whether it's looking at the red sea
[2:18:51] looking at the wall
[2:18:52] looking at the mountain
[2:18:54] looking at your own situation our
[2:18:56] reasons
[2:18:57] fail
[2:18:58] but god's word can't fail
[2:19:01] you know
[2:19:03] brother bennett made a statement like
[2:19:04] this remember how many times brother
[2:19:05] brain would tell the story about that
[2:19:07] when he was out there worshiping and he
[2:19:08] heard that elk bugle and all those
[2:19:11] things was going on
[2:19:12] brother bram says he began to
[2:19:14] god directed his attention to that that
[2:19:18] that chatter and that that eagle
[2:19:21] brother brown says he looked at that
[2:19:22] eagle and eventually said that eagle
[2:19:25] got enough of that chatter
[2:19:26] and it took off
[2:19:28] brother brown says it like this in 64 he
[2:19:31] says
[2:19:32] this word has wings on it
[2:19:36] he said this word that has wings on it
[2:19:38] will make a way out of every situation
[2:19:43] it has wings on it and it'll cut its way
[2:19:45] through
[2:19:46] so no matter what it is listen
[2:19:48] even let me just say it in the words of
[2:19:50] how the prophet put it in the prayer
[2:19:52] letter it's time to doubt your doubts
[2:19:56] and to believe god's word
[2:19:58] because what god has said about you is
[2:20:00] more true than what you think about you
[2:20:04] and if you just enter into that channel
[2:20:06] that's the simplicity see the enemy
[2:20:07] always wants to bring us back into us
[2:20:10] it's something that we have to do it's
[2:20:12] not what we have to do
[2:20:13] if we yield to him he takes us
[2:20:17] to healing he takes us to deliverance he
[2:20:20] takes us to the baptism of the holy
[2:20:21] ghost because he's the enforcer of his
[2:20:24] word
[2:20:25] i'll tell you what a what a privilege
[2:20:27] tonight you know let me just say it you
[2:20:29] can look at it in your life and say well
[2:20:31] i don't see the word working but there's
[2:20:33] a difference
[2:20:34] is it you handling the word
[2:20:36] or is it the word handling you
[2:20:39] you see when god directed samson to pick
[2:20:42] up the jawbone of an ass samson was not
[2:20:44] doing that out of enthusiasm but it was
[2:20:46] a spirit of god that moved down in
[2:20:48] samson's life that took a hold of the
[2:20:50] word
[2:20:51] and satan's desires try to bring
[2:20:52] frustration that we get out and we're
[2:20:54] trying to turn around a situation loved
[2:20:56] one or whatever it is it'll never work
[2:20:59] because it's our own strength
[2:21:01] but if we will go in the power of his
[2:21:02] might
[2:21:04] if we'll go in his strength that he's
[2:21:05] supplied to us and just look to god and
[2:21:08] wait for his anointing and move right in
[2:21:10] that channel his anointing has come
[2:21:11] right here tonight
[2:21:12] how many say amen to that no matter what
[2:21:15] your need is tonight all you have to do
[2:21:17] is move right in that channel i believe
[2:21:19] we've moved in that channel tonight and
[2:21:21] i believe in moving into that channel
[2:21:22] that you can take all your frustrations
[2:21:25] and every failure you can leave that
[2:21:27] behind you and allow the holy spirit and
[2:21:30] say god this situation in front of me
[2:21:32] let your hands be wrapped up on my life
[2:21:37] amen and let the word of god go to work
[2:21:40] and produce
[2:21:42] what he said it would do
[2:21:44] and then we stand back and say glory be
[2:21:46] to god
[2:21:47] he's a waymaker
[2:21:49] there's no situation that's too big for
[2:21:52] god
[2:21:53] there's no situation that you can look
[2:21:55] at and say that's unredeemable there's
[2:21:57] no situation that is unredeemable
[2:22:02] i'm not going to preach but i think we
[2:22:03] got
[2:22:04] god
[2:22:06] has let it be known there's nothing
[2:22:11] nothing that's greater than god
[2:22:14] nothing's greater than this situation
[2:22:16] i'll tell you tonight you couldn't have
[2:22:17] got more personal if it would have just
[2:22:19] been god and you in the room that's how
[2:22:22] personal this message brings jesus
[2:22:25] christ
[2:22:27] aren't you glad for that
[2:22:29] it's a word that gives us strength
[2:22:32] ministers ability ministers courage to
[2:22:34] us so don't walk out here with your head
[2:22:35] down you walk out here with your head up
[2:22:37] high
[2:22:37] you have received a word from the king
[2:22:40] i don't care what you feel like right
[2:22:42] now that word is working
[2:22:44] and you yield to that word and that word
[2:22:47] produces in your life
[2:22:49] amen
[2:22:50] [Music]
[2:22:51] i'm a product of it how many is a
[2:22:53] product of it i'm a product of it this
[2:22:56] message works
[2:22:58] this message works
[2:23:00] amen it's not the ideas of man
[2:23:03] this is not this message never come
[2:23:05] you've heard me say this this message
[2:23:06] has never come it is not up to me to try
[2:23:09] to pick out quotes and say this is
[2:23:11] brother graham's opinion this is brother
[2:23:12] braham's a thought i don't that's
[2:23:14] nonsense
[2:23:16] god has not anointed the ministry in
[2:23:18] this hour to do that
[2:23:21] but god has anointed us to preach it
[2:23:25] is that all right
[2:23:26] god's anointed us to preach it in any
[2:23:28] other voice that says any other thing we
[2:23:30] tune it out because it's an uncertain
[2:23:33] sound
[2:23:35] god has vindicated his word in this hour
[2:23:37] and i'm glad about it
[2:23:39] i'm glad about it to me it's just it's
[2:23:41] joy
[2:23:42] i'm thankful there's a real absolute of
[2:23:44] the holy spirit that's come in this hour
[2:23:46] that ties us right back in the word
[2:23:48] he's a waymaker in me
[2:23:51] glory be to god
[2:23:53] hallelujah amen we're going to let you
[2:23:55] be dismissed in the name of the lord
