fight this battle we all fighting about a church young people don't think you don't know when fighting about we all face it how do you know some people might be physical some might be spiritual in other words you know it's like you started getting older you know things started feeling little things that you'd ever feel when you age you twenty years old you feel humming the hook 20 more years later you say I mad watch it just changes I mean I just go when I first start preaching I'm running and jumping out here I remember her cousin several flips preaching I was 25 years old maybe 26 and when everybody thought running jumping cut flip and although the young guys that was at that time they were sitting on the internet you're looking why I come back 20 years later need them grown up 19 thinking I said no no I said just like what happened tonight see if I kind of flip tonight you better pick up your cell phone called 9-1-1 this this body right here is not ready ever let you know right I would let you know that what we all grown in and we are in prevail weight in front of a manifestation waited by the I prefer the strike this body right hello Lou you that was Jesus he come for his atmosphere within himself he conquered it Jesus was late after Jesus was baptized the Bible say he will lead into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil at him fasted forty days and forty nights a forty days and forty nights fast your stomach over a hamburger look like Outback I mean you know Jesus had to fight that human battle if Gina would have fight it the devil in the supernatural way then we had to pin on the super they not in a in a miracle way and we had to look for miracles every time something going but Jesus wanted us to put our faith in the word because heaven and earth will pass away but my word won't pass away so we need something that won't bet what L promise you fail what have been healing only they might fall into it but the word will live and by forever and ever and ever so edgy Nutella if he gonna tell us to walk by faith walk and bleed a word then he can prove he going to put it to the test so Hickel Jesus he's in AD with Willis Peter plaster 40 days 40 night and he is weak I mean weak like you would be cuz he's fighting that he facing the devil as a magnet he could have you know he was God he could have done what he want to do but he he decided to face him as a man so when you know what it was doing he was taking out all the excuse for the weak Christians he trying to let the weak Christians know that you look at me to use y'all gal wish you get you can always beat the devil how do you even want to prove I want to let you know Devon that the weakest Christian they can beat you any place any time any world so to do that he had to become weak you know sometimes we say oh I'm just too weak no you hey do we how do you can you say a word wave you hate if you can't say you can't wave your hand let her cure come down that god no I'm not giving up I'm not hold on so the devil came to a prefers for speaking to him telling him if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread show me Jesus this is going on in his mind just demon is fighting him in his mind doing Jesus turn it into fuel son of God do it do it Jesus said I do nothing except the father show me if I turn the stone into bread then I'm preaching just said the devil Hailey's uh but what did Jesus do Jesus goes to the devil and he goes back to the word because the power is in his word he goes back his word he's a Satan it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word to precede neither man for God I just say if Jesus would decide that he was gonna he hungry I need some bread I need some meat pick a stone off the ground out here to do this thang bread big old sit right there hot little brother put on it we wouldn't even have safe to walk out the door because you would have had to see a miracle daughter believed god but jesus never pointed you to a miracle he pointed you back to the word it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word never seen animal ago the word is what a power [Applause] he was trying to teach us if you take the word you could beat the devil so the delicas Jesus upon this high on a temple then he get religious real religious and he tells Jesus he called his songs 90 woman cast yourself down cache yourself Darryl we're not he give his angels charge concerning thee except I dashed our feet against the snow you know I've done the Delvian now just one dumb that's the last thing you want that Vegeta to cast yourself down you don't want him to do that and he hit one of us against the stone because of Gina when the cast herself down and he bust his head against the storm if a quarter we fold it to the ground he go brave of all counter hey what you want to do if the devil would I knew that he wouldn't never come want to kill him that one he didn't want to do then the devil came in and personally the God he here impersonated the God he got if you notice what he was like the Jesus do if you fall down and worship me what ship is to make something to God how do something that you prostrate yourself before if you fall down and make me first in the God hey I'll let you be the second so they can preach to Lourdes anyway yeah I want you to elevate your position
