[0:00] because you're good you're wrong
[0:04] god gave you two hands that can work god
[0:07] gave you a mind that can think god gave
[0:09] you feet to walk and carry you there god
[0:12] gave you a vehicle to get you there
[0:15] trust me
[0:16] i've been there where you're thinking
[0:18] lord i need a vehicle
[0:20] i don't know what i'm going to do with
[0:21] this thing it's falling apart there was
[0:23] one time we pulled into my parents
[0:25] driveway and from the end of the
[0:26] driveway up probably longer than from
[0:29] here to the back of the church there
[0:32] that mirror in the back
[0:33] the muffler fell off and there were
[0:36] pieces all the way up the driveway
[0:41] lord i don't
[0:43] just keep driving
[0:47] but god god gives us the ability god
[0:50] gives us the strength spiritually it's
[0:52] it's god who causes us to grow
[0:56] and and and so when you're talking to
[0:58] these believers when you talk to brother
[1:00] bill and different ones they they're
[1:02] they're giving god the glory he gave
[1:04] them the ability he gave them the
[1:06] success he gave the blessing and he gets
[1:09] all the glory
[1:13] now i i
[1:14] i was thinking about this just through
[1:16] some conversations back home that have
[1:18] happened recently and i thought you know
[1:20] we we
[1:21] you may be sitting here this morning and
[1:23] you may have been in the message all
[1:25] your life you may be just coming into
[1:27] the message
[1:28] but
[1:29] we might need god we do need god but i'm
[1:32] just saying this morning you may need
[1:34] god to bring you the truth of the
[1:36] message
[1:37] even though you've been in it for years
[1:41] you you something something maybe you're
[1:43] new here this morning and something's
[1:45] drawn you to the ministry here and and
[1:47] maybe maybe you don't know exactly what
[1:49] it is but you know it's truth coming
[1:51] forward but yet you feel you you just
[1:53] feel like there's so much for you to
[1:55] learn sitting here this morning
[1:57] and yet it's it's it's god that drops
[2:01] the truth into your heart by revelation
[2:04] you could try all you want you could
[2:05] read your bible from from morning till
[2:08] night from
[2:09] now until christ comes and it'll do you
[2:12] no good unless the author drops what he
[2:14] wrote into your heart
[2:18] and he can't use what you think about it
[2:20] you know i was thinking about this too
[2:22] we we've got
[2:23] we've got you know there's a lot of
[2:25] old-timers in the church but there's a
[2:26] lot of young bucks that have come up too
[2:28] and and
[2:30] god can't use what you think about the
[2:32] message
[2:34] god can't use what you think about the
[2:36] scripture
[2:38] god will give inspiration i'm not trying
[2:40] to take away from that but just make
[2:41] sure that it's of god and not of an
[2:43] arrogance that you know i've been in
[2:45] this thing and and you know this this
[2:48] young brother he's he's boring me
[2:50] because he's not talking about the deep
[2:51] things of god
[2:54] i can tell you you're off track right
[2:55] there not because you're thinking i
[2:57] don't care that you think that about me
[3:00] it because i know where the truth of it
[3:02] is
[3:03] and that's that god god has to reveal
[3:05] that to you you can't bring that to god
[3:07] and say god this is what you this is
[3:09] what you meant through the message and
[3:11] this is none of these ministers are
[3:13] right lord what
[3:15] i'm i'm right and they're all wrong
[3:19] you've crossed confidence and you've
[3:20] gotten into arrogance
[3:30] you know one of the reasons that the
[3:31] prophet gives actually the reason he
[3:34] gives in this message perfect strength
[3:36] by perfect weakness he gives the reason
[3:38] that we come to church
[3:40] and and i'll give you a scripture to
[3:41] back it up says the bible says judgment
[3:43] begins at the house of god and and
[3:48] i want to drop this in because i want to
[3:50] challenge our thinking this morning of
[3:52] your reason why you're here this morning
[3:56] why did you come to church
[3:58] some come to get a pat on the back
[4:00] and then they'll leave disappointed
[4:03] but the prophet said that we come to
[4:05] church to find out what our faults are
[4:07] and the things that we might better
[4:09] ourselves by
[4:10] and to find our bad places
[4:13] to find our bad places and you say
[4:15] that's a terrible reason to come to
[4:16] church but but remember what i'm
[4:18] preaching this morning is that through
[4:20] your weakness god is made strong
[4:23] and so we find our faults so that we can
[4:25] grow in those areas and so that we can
[4:27] bring those things to god so that we can
[4:29] grow and be who god wants us to be it's
[4:32] it's it's maybe you feel like man this
[4:34] minister is really pointing out my
[4:36] weaknesses but god is pointing them out
[4:38] because he wants you to bring that to
[4:40] him so that he can make it a strength in
[4:42] your life
[4:43] so that he can be strong through you
[4:46] and and and
[4:48] we receive encouragement coming to
[4:50] church and we receive correction and we
[4:53] we receive building up but sometimes god
[4:56] might have to tear down what you've
[4:58] built up yourself so that he can build
[5:01] the right foundation so that he could
[5:03] build the right building so that he can
[5:06] use the right materials for the building
[5:10] and so so often you know sometimes we
[5:12] can come to church
[5:14] and and you know we we think we got it
[5:17] all together and and you know lord lord
[5:20] i really need i i need encouragement
[5:22] this morning lord and then the minister
[5:25] comes and you think lord i still need
[5:28] encouragement this morning
[5:31] but just just really lock into what's
[5:34] what's being said and to the heart of
[5:36] what's being said because because you
[5:38] know
[5:39] when when i come and i know that i know
[5:41] that the ministers you know brother sam
[5:43] and and our hearts desire is that our
[5:45] heart beats in unity and harmony with
[5:48] what god's heart is if i none of this i
[5:52] listen i'll open the door i'll throw my
[5:54] ipad out if this is of myself because i
[5:57] don't want to bring anything that's of
[5:58] my own mind and on my own heart i i you
[6:01] know in study god will drop things you
[6:04] know even i preached this wednesday at
[6:06] home but in in going back through my
[6:08] notes and praying lord what would you
[6:10] have for this congregation i'm i'm
[6:13] deleting stuff and adding stuff and and
[6:16] god's just taking me down past and i
[6:18] think lord i'm i'm just gonna trust you
[6:19] that this is this is what you have for
[6:22] this people because i don't i don't know
[6:25] their situations i don't need to know
[6:27] your situation
[6:29] and and i have a heart for your
[6:31] situation but what i want is i want god
[6:33] to step into that situation not brandon
[6:36] synacola because like i said i when i
[6:38] look at myself i don't see much but but
[6:41] if god can use me and god can speak to
[6:43] you then that's all's that matters
[6:48] and you this is just maybe my uh my
[6:52] calling in life um
[6:54] uh
[6:56] you know it's just i i think i've
[6:58] mentioned it before my burden for for my
[7:00] pastor back home and and it's for the
[7:02] congregation and i feel that for brother
[7:04] sam this morning too is i just i have a
[7:06] burden and and you know
[7:09] brother paul back home gave me you know
[7:11] he calls me assistant pastor and i and i
[7:14] really appreciate that and it means a
[7:16] lot
[7:17] and and so these things get on my heart
[7:19] though pertaining to pastors and and
[7:22] maybe i couldn't say it back home
[7:24] because i because i know of certain
[7:26] situations but i don't know of your
[7:28] situation so i'm just going to say a
[7:29] couple things this morning
[7:32] if we come to church to find out where
[7:35] our bad parts are and i want to say one
[7:36] more thing about that
[7:38] we find out where those are but i want
[7:40] you to remember i remember what i spoke
[7:42] on last time the scripture i took was
[7:44] bala took balaam around to the hindu
[7:46] parts of israel to the bad parts of
[7:48] israel and when he went to go speak a
[7:50] curse god spoke a blessing and he said i
[7:52] don't see what you're saying he said i
[7:54] see him justified
[7:57] that's how god sees you and your
[7:58] weaknesses this morning
[8:01] but if we come to church to find out
[8:03] where those bad places are and where our
[8:05] weaknesses are and with the things we
[8:07] need to shore up and things then you
[8:08] have to have confidence that the man
[8:11] bringing the word is your pastor
[8:15] and and one of the services i listened
[8:17] to that that really spoke to me in in
[8:19] just different conversations and and you
[8:22] know things with my pastor and the way i
[8:24] was feeling at the time and then i
[8:26] overheard a brother tell my pastor at a
[8:29] minister's meeting we had and he said
[8:30] you know this is a really good service
[8:32] that i can't remember the conversation
[8:34] how it got brought up because it was so
[8:36] it was just a quick comment and he said
[8:38] abel ministers brother harold beckett
[8:40] family camp
[8:41] and i thought i got to find that
[8:43] so i went and i found it and as i'm
[8:45] listening i'm realizing lord this is
[8:47] everything that i feel called to
[8:49] this is this is my calling lord and but
[8:52] in there he said a lot of things that i
[8:54] just thought was so good
[8:56] and one of the things is you have to
[8:58] know who your pastor is
[9:00] and you have to be able to receive what
[9:02] he's bringing behind the pulpit because
[9:04] if if we come to church to see our bad
[9:07] spots and you resent that man you'll
[9:10] never receive it
[9:12] you have to know who your pastor is you
[9:14] have to know that this man has your very
[9:16] best interest in mind and if you don't
[9:19] have that if you if you if you sit in
[9:21] your seat and you resent the man then
[9:23] you need to pray about where to go to
[9:25] church
[9:26] because not only do you hurt yourself if
[9:29] you have a family you're going to hurt
[9:30] your family don't ever talk about a
[9:33] minister in front of your family
[9:35] you may have to have conversations
[9:37] between you and your wife but never do
[9:39] that in front of your kids because there
[9:41] may be some day when god needs to use
[9:44] that man to speak to your kid but
[9:46] because you bad-mouth that man god can't
[9:49] use him
[9:50] because you remember what the prophet
[9:52] said that the she-bears came out and
[9:54] they destroyed those kids because they
[9:56] were making fun of the prophet of god
[9:58] and the prophet our prophet for this day
[10:00] said that was because the parents at
[10:02] home badmouthed them
[10:04] [Applause]
[10:05] so maybe i've said those things before
[10:07] but i just felt to put it in here again
[10:10] because we have to have confidence in
[10:12] the man and know that god has given us
[10:16] this gift
[10:17] behind this pulpit to tell us our if
[10:20] we're going to receive him telling us
[10:22] where our where our
[10:24] our weaknesses are
[10:28] so the prophet said any other objection
[10:30] by coming to church and we don't get
[10:32] much out of it
[10:34] you won't get much out of church unless
[10:36] you come to realize where your bad spots
[10:38] are
[10:40] that's that's a little bit hard to
[10:41] swallow ain't it
[10:43] you can't come to be seen
[10:45] you can't come to be heard it don't
[10:47] matter how loud you say amen if you're
[10:50] wanting to be heard then
[10:52] it don't you're coming for the wrong
[10:54] reason
[10:55] you can't come to show off the new dress
[10:57] you can't come to show off the new suit
[10:59] or to see so and so
[11:01] you know if if you got a little uh
[11:04] liking going on with the with the
[11:05] brother or sister in the church then
[11:07] then you know if that's the only reason
[11:09] you come to church that's a good benefit
[11:10] to come into the church i'm not gonna
[11:12] lie
[11:13] but if that's the only reason you're
[11:14] coming to church you're coming for the
[11:16] wrong reason
[11:18] let me give you young young men and any
[11:21] any singles in the church a little
[11:23] advice if you come to serve god and to
[11:25] get closer to christ and and you come
[11:28] for these right reasons you'll attract
[11:30] the right mate
[11:31] you'll attract the right character
[11:33] character draws character and if you're
[11:35] coming just to be seen you're coming
[11:37] just to see her then then brother she's
[11:40] going to pick up on that
[11:41] because you're not coming for the right
[11:43] reason
[11:46] if we come for some religious obligation
[11:49] or or to get a good feeling
[11:51] because you know you go to a camp
[11:53] meeting because it's just it's it's the
[11:55] glory it's it's the hurah from the glory
[11:58] days you know we want to go back to the
[11:59] glory days and and have the camp
[12:01] meetings again and and so you go or or
[12:04] maybe you stay home from service regular
[12:06] service but you know camp meeting i'm in
[12:10] i'm in i remember the glory days i'm
[12:12] into the camp meeting so you come to
[12:14] church and you know it's like it's like
[12:16] a a uh
[12:18] you know we we always say you come to
[12:20] church on easter and christmas you know
[12:22] but but you know you're coming for a
[12:24] religious something you know religious
[12:26] some religious reason that you're going
[12:28] to come because of a camp meeting but so
[12:30] i just asked you this morning why do you
[12:32] come to church
[12:35] and that's just for you to reflect on in
[12:37] your heart
[12:40] so i said you know if if we're new to
[12:42] christianity or we're new to the message
[12:44] don't try to figure everything out the
[12:46] bible says the holy ghost will teach you
[12:49] if you've been in the message for years
[12:51] and you realize lord i need a change
[12:53] there's something i'm not viewing this
[12:54] the way i should don't try to figure it
[12:56] out
[12:57] call on the holy ghost
[12:59] because james 1 verse 5 if you want a
[13:01] scripture for that says does anyone lack
[13:03] wisdom let them ask of god who gives it
[13:06] freely and it shall be given to them
[13:11] so let me let me just
[13:13] see if i can get off arrogance and
[13:14] things and we'll get back to weaknesses
[13:23] when we feel we know everything whether
[13:25] it's because we've been in churches or
[13:28] in the message all of our lives god has
[13:30] to take us on the backside of the desert
[13:34] where we can learn human weakness
[13:38] moses and
[13:40] and paul
[13:41] if anybody had bragging rights in the
[13:42] bible it was moses and paul
[13:46] just
[13:47] you know moses i i i never quite heard
[13:50] him say this before and until i was
[13:52] listening to this message but brother
[13:53] branham said you know in the in the
[13:55] movie of the ten commandments he said
[13:57] you know moses he's this you know got
[13:59] big arms and stuff and he said i imagine
[14:01] that's what moses looked like
[14:03] because he said he was he was brought up
[14:06] under in the palace of pharaoh and you
[14:08] know strong man and military leader and
[14:11] could teach the teachers and things you
[14:13] know but yet god said i can't use any of
[14:17] that
[14:19] and that's a little bit discouraging
[14:21] because he took him on the back side of
[14:22] the desert for 40 years to get out of
[14:25] him lord let me be like paul if you got
[14:26] to get anything out let it only be three
[14:33] but the prophet says this and then the
[14:35] other side we get these feelings and we
[14:37] think that we're insufficient
[14:39] and we don't want to do it
[14:41] but then if we just listen to the call
[14:43] of god that's the very thing that god
[14:45] wants to get us into that that kind of
[14:47] shape so we can he says in another spot
[14:50] he says if you get to think in that way
[14:52] too much then you'll never do nothing
[14:54] because you're focusing on your
[14:55] weaknesses at that point if i focus on
[14:57] my weaknesses i'll sit down
[15:00] i just i'm
[15:02] i got nothing
[15:03] but but
[15:05] you can't focus you can take you can
[15:07] take either side arroga or or looking at
[15:09] yourself too much
[15:11] he says when we are insufficient
[15:13] ourselves then we are subjects to yield
[15:16] to god's spirit this is a big part i
[15:19] believe is when we realize we're
[15:21] insufficient then we're subjects to
[15:23] yield to god's spirit as long as we
[15:26] think that we can do it then we can't do
[15:28] it but when we get to the place where we
[15:30] know we can't do it
[15:32] then we yield ourselves to god and he
[15:34] does it
[15:35] so then if it's us trying to do it we'll
[15:37] fail but we'll if we'll just yield
[15:39] ourselves to god then god can't fail
[15:42] there's only one thing god cannot do
[15:45] and that's fail
[15:47] he can do anything else but fail but he
[15:50] cannot fail
[15:51] he says whenever you get licked and
[15:53] realize you're licked
[15:55] and then come back come come on back and
[15:57] humble yourself get weak find out you're
[16:00] human
[16:02] and there's none of your intellectuals
[16:04] can do it
[16:05] human
[16:06] weakness will never be used of god
[16:11] god by the human weakness
[16:13] pours himself into you
[16:16] then he uses himself
[16:18] you just become an instrument certainly
[16:21] you've got to get yourself
[16:23] out of the way
[16:24] i want to read that last part just one
[16:26] more time because there's so much said
[16:27] there
[16:29] human weakness will never be used of god
[16:32] god by the human weakness pours himself
[16:36] into you
[16:37] then he uses himself
[16:40] you just become an instrument
[16:42] certainly you've got to get yourself out
[16:45] of the way
[16:49] you can't bring your sin to god and say
[16:52] god
[16:52] use this
[16:54] it'll never work
[16:56] but sometimes god will use that sin
[17:01] so that you realize how weak you are and
[17:04] then they'll say okay now you're humble
[17:07] now i can use you
[17:09] he'll use those things he'll let those
[17:10] things happen hard to believe but i
[17:13] believe he'll let those things happen so
[17:15] that you humble yourself and then he can
[17:18] use you
[17:21] so
[17:24] are you with me still
[17:26] second corinthians 12.
[17:41] second corinthians 12 and verse 6
[17:45] for though i would desire to glory
[17:48] so if you ever want to read something
[17:50] good go back and read
[17:52] chapter 11 and chapter 12 because like i
[17:54] said if anyone had bragging rights it
[17:56] was paul
[17:57] and
[17:59] paul actually had to take the
[18:00] opportunity to brag a little bit
[18:02] because the corinthian church there were
[18:04] men who were bragging and the corinthian
[18:06] church was gravitating towards them
[18:08] and paul says okay
[18:11] you want to follow the man who has
[18:12] bragging rights
[18:14] here i come
[18:16] rolls up his sleeves and just lays it
[18:18] all out everything he's been through
[18:20] and he keeps saying though he keeps
[18:22] saying you know bear with me in my folly
[18:24] this is this is foolish to do but i
[18:27] gotta do it
[18:28] because other men are trying to come in
[18:32] and steal your heart but he says for
[18:33] though i would desire to glory
[18:35] i shall not be a fool for i will say the
[18:38] truth
[18:39] but now i forbear lest any man should
[18:41] think of me above that which he seeth me
[18:44] to be or that he heareth of me
[18:46] and lest i should be exalted above
[18:48] measure
[18:50] though the abundance of the revelations
[18:52] there was given to me a thorn in the
[18:54] flesh
[18:55] the messenger of satan to buffet me
[18:58] lest i should be exalted above measure
[19:01] for this thing i besought the lord
[19:02] thrice and
[19:04] that it might depart from me and he said
[19:07] unto me my grace is sufficient for thee
[19:10] for this is how god works
[19:13] for my strength is made perfect in
[19:15] weakness
[19:17] most gladly therefore will i rather
[19:20] glory in my infirmities that the power
[19:22] of christ may rest upon me
[19:24] therefore i take pleasure in infirmity
[19:26] in reproach and necessities in
[19:28] persecutions and distresses
[19:30] for christ's sake
[19:32] for when i am weak
[19:34] then am i strong
[19:36] then am only them
[19:38] am i strong
[19:42] paul could have come
[19:44] with the abundance of wisdom that he had
[19:48] in the training and the teaching that he
[19:50] had with with great words to to wow the
[19:53] people
[19:55] and he said i didn't come in any of that
[19:57] but i came in the power and the
[19:59] demonstration of the gospel because i
[20:02] got all of me out of me and let god take
[20:04] over and then through all of that
[20:07] revelation that god just started opening
[20:09] even everything that he had known about
[20:12] the message prior
[20:13] god had to burn all of that out of him
[20:16] reteach him and even in all of that
[20:18] revelation god gives him a little bit of
[20:20] an affirmative
[20:22] to help keep him humble
[20:25] to help keep him humble because god
[20:27] needed paul to stay humble so that he
[20:29] could continue to use him because when
[20:31] paul would realize you know lord this
[20:34] this thing and brother branham said it
[20:35] buff it as like a waves on a ship it
[20:38] would come and then it would go and it
[20:39] would come and paul would pray and then
[20:41] it would go and then it would come and
[20:43] paul would pray and it would go and it's
[20:44] just this this thing that was always in
[20:46] paul's life and and lord why is this
[20:49] what can't you take this from me and and
[20:51] christ speaks to him and he says listen
[20:53] that's there
[20:54] because if it wasn't there you'd get a
[20:56] little too big-headed
[20:58] and i need you to stay humble i need you
[21:00] to i need you to get low every now and
[21:02] then so that you realize that that
[21:05] you're that you're you stay humble so i
[21:08] can be strong in your life
[21:11] the greek dialogue said it like this and
[21:13] this was just really neat my favor is
[21:15] sufficient for power is perfected in
[21:18] weakness
[21:20] power is perfected in weakness
[21:23] when we recognize our weaknesses
[21:26] we can turn them over to the lord
[21:29] we recognize we need his help and we
[21:32] surrender that area in our life to him
[21:34] and then his power comes in and perfects
[21:37] that spot
[21:38] but you have to recognize it and not
[21:41] just waller in it and oh i'm so low and
[21:43] i'm so downtrodden by this thing then
[21:46] you take it to god
[21:48] god this is in my life god this is how i
[21:50] feel about myself but i just want to get
[21:52] out of the way and lord i pray that that
[21:54] you would help me be humble and that you
[21:57] would you would step in and be my
[21:59] strength
[22:00] i need you to take this area of my life
[22:09] time's going quick from my standpoint so
[22:11] hopefully it is from yours too
[22:20] we're almost done here
[22:23] when he was weak then he become strong
[22:25] yes sir he shut the heavens this is
[22:27] elijah that it would rain
[22:29] that's when he got strong when he lost
[22:31] his church lost everything he had
[22:33] everything else but he stayed with god's
[22:35] word then he had power to shut the
[22:37] heavens
[22:38] when jacob lost all his strength then
[22:40] god gave him power to become a prince
[22:42] see when paul lost his education in all
[22:45] his theology god made him a missionary
[22:47] to the gentiles when moses lost all of
[22:49] his ability and become weak god made him
[22:52] powerful and sent him to egypt in the
[22:54] power of the spirit at 80 years old
[23:01] whiskers hanging down
[23:04] his wife on a mule in a young and
[23:06] sitting on her lap and
[23:08] and a stick in his hand went down and
[23:10] conquered egypt
[23:12] yeah see not with an army behind him
[23:14] like he wanted to go but in the power of
[23:17] the spirit amen
[23:21] sometimes in your weakest time
[23:23] is when jesus comes
[23:28] and the weakest of moments
[23:30] that's when jesus comes
[23:34] when you've lost your spouse and you
[23:36] feel weak
[23:37] when you've lost a little one
[23:39] and you feel sad
[23:43] god will come by and give you strength
[23:47] jesus said blessed are they who mourn
[23:50] for they shall be comforted
[23:53] you have to know mourning before you can
[23:55] no comfort
[23:58] when you when you've lost your job and
[24:00] you're losing your home and your vehicle
[24:02] god will make you strong
[24:06] it's hard to it's when you're going
[24:08] through it you even despise the man
[24:10] saying that
[24:13] but god will come on the scene and he'll
[24:14] give you strength to go through that
[24:17] there's there's a reason there's a
[24:18] purpose there's a brother
[24:20] lost lost his job
[24:22] they just
[24:24] tried to move him out and you know get
[24:26] him to quit and he and he wouldn't he
[24:27] just gave his very best and so they laid
[24:29] him off
[24:30] and he said you know the timing of that
[24:34] was perfect because even in the meeting
[24:36] before the day before he said i learned
[24:38] things that i could put on my resume
[24:41] that happened for growth in the company
[24:44] really under you know the help of his
[24:46] leadership in in some of the areas so he
[24:49] was able to put that on his resume
[24:51] and then he had a job he really wanted
[24:53] to get and he didn't end up getting it
[24:55] and come to find out a friend who's
[24:57] working there said things are going down
[24:59] the tube in this company all of a sudden
[25:01] so he said it it may just be the lord
[25:03] you didn't get that job
[25:05] the friend didn't say that but you know
[25:07] we're we're saying that to him encourage
[25:09] him
[25:13] confess your weakness the prophet said
[25:15] but confess your faith in god and his
[25:18] strength
[25:19] and his word
[25:21] we got to empty ourselves we got to
[25:23] empty our vessels empty what we know
[25:25] empty what we think and just say god
[25:28] here i am
[25:29] i i'm here lord to present myself to you
[25:33] and i know that there's nothing more
[25:35] that i can do
[25:37] would you wash me and dress me in your
[25:40] righteousness and until you're finally
[25:42] through
[25:43] lord i'm still going to come and present
[25:45] myself to you
[25:46] because i need you
[25:52] if you think you have strength just
[25:54] closing comments here if you think you
[25:56] have strength you can stand to your feet
[25:58] you'll take your own way of doing it
[26:01] you have to realize you're weak so
[26:03] you'll take up what god has given you to
[26:05] be strong
[26:07] so if you're looking at your own
[26:09] strength you'll pick that up
[26:12] and and i actually
[26:15] i heard this in the greatest battle ever
[26:17] fought brother branham made the comment
[26:19] he says you can't even sin until you lay
[26:22] god's word down so you actually
[26:26] if you think you're strong in your own
[26:28] strength what you'll do
[26:30] is you'll actually lay down your
[26:32] strength
[26:34] and you'll pick up what you feel is your
[26:36] strength
[26:37] and your weapon you know in in in
[26:40] samson's hand under the power of god
[26:44] an old dried-up
[26:46] donkey jawbone
[26:48] could bash in inch thick brass helmets
[26:52] but if samson would have went in his own
[26:54] strength
[26:55] it would have been it would have turned
[26:57] to dust as soon as he picked it up he
[26:59] wouldn't have had nothing to fight with
[27:01] but under the power of god he picked up
[27:03] what god had placed in his hand
[27:06] and god gave him strength with it
[27:10] and you know i i just just in the last
[27:14] maybe closing comments i'm going to skip
[27:16] some of
[27:17] my last comments here
[27:21] is
[27:22] when you look at the different lives in
[27:25] in hebrews 11
[27:28] you look at gideon
[27:30] where was gideon when the angel of the
[27:32] lord came to him
[27:34] hiding behind the well i believe it was
[27:39] and not only that but then he sees an
[27:41] angel
[27:43] and he sees an angel and then he says
[27:47] you know gives them all of his excuses
[27:49] all of his weaknesses lists them out
[27:52] and then he says
[27:55] you know the angel says but you're a
[27:56] mighty man of valor i'm going to use you
[28:00] and he says
[28:02] um
[28:04] i know you're an angel but i need a sign
[28:09] and then the sign happens and he goes
[28:12] well praise the lord
[28:13] [Music]
[28:15] i see i've seen an angel i've been given
[28:17] one sign i think i need another sign
[28:20] and yet god used gideon
[28:23] as a judge of israel
[28:24] and not only that with all of that with
[28:27] with disbelieving the word of god
[28:30] god puts them over in the hebrews
[28:35] and then you look at barack
[28:38] and barack i don't know i i had to kind
[28:40] of refresh myself and this is
[28:42] interesting and and
[28:44] uh you know your sisters if you don't
[28:46] see this yet then just bear with me
[28:48] forgive me but barack a prophetess come
[28:51] to him
[28:53] a woman prophet and she said god's gonna
[28:56] use you you're gonna go defeat the enemy
[28:58] and here's barack i i imagine you know
[29:01] just
[29:02] maybe built you know i don't know i
[29:03] don't know if he was
[29:05] a general in the army or what you know
[29:07] but it just you know god's going to use
[29:09] you go and take the enemy
[29:11] and barack says
[29:14] okay okay
[29:16] all right
[29:17] but you have to come with me
[29:19] [Music]
[29:21] so he tells this woman
[29:24] brothers you tell your wife i'll go
[29:26] serve the lord
[29:28] but only if you come with me
[29:30] and if you don't come with me i'm not
[29:32] gonna serve the lord
[29:34] and she says okay i'll go with you but
[29:36] you don't get any glory in this
[29:38] and yet barack
[29:40] being led by a woman
[29:43] ends up over in
[29:45] hebrews
[29:46] look at the weakness of the man
[29:49] no no spine no backbone
[29:53] and yet he ends up in hebrews
[29:56] so
[29:58] my main
[29:59] theme
[30:00] my main heart what i believe god's heart
[30:02] was and through this message and
[30:04] hopefully it's been made clear by now
[30:05] but
[30:06] is
[30:07] though you're weak
[30:10] you're strong
[30:12] though you have all these faults and
[30:14] things and you just you struggle along
[30:16] and you and you just feel like i can't
[30:18] make it and and and and though you have
[30:21] days of sadness
[30:23] yet
[30:24] god will make you strong
[30:26] you know you're already there in god's
[30:28] eyes
[30:30] i i i god will make you strong he'll
[30:32] give you he'll give you he'll let your
[30:34] theophany
[30:36] right because your theophany is already
[30:39] though this tabernacle be destroyed we
[30:42] already have one waiting in the presence
[30:43] of god
[30:45] your theophany will come and
[30:48] no no this is who you are this is who
[30:50] you are brother
[30:51] this is who you are this is who you are
[30:54] and you'll be given strength from on
[30:56] high
[30:58] so i pray i pray this encourages you
[31:02] i pray that this shows you where your
[31:04] weak spots are
[31:06] and i pray that you leave knowing that
[31:08] god
[31:09] is bigger than you are
[31:12] god is greater than your mistakes
[31:14] god's greater than your strengths
[31:18] and god's going to lead us through
[31:20] amen
[31:22] god bless you let's uh
[31:24] maybe brother if you sing something i'll
[31:26] pray after you sing
