[36:27] pray Lord father we ask God this morning
[36:30] that for every need that's here Lord we
[36:33] lifted before your throne Lord and know
[36:35] that God that you have already met that
[36:38] need Lord it's already a finished work
[36:40] Calvary itself Lord was a manifestation
[36:43] of a finished work of God and Lord we
[36:47] rest there Lord God in that finished
[36:50] work father we love you and we thank you
[36:53] Lord this morning
[36:54] will you come just break the word to our
[36:56] hearts anoint Lord speaker and here
[36:59] together we pray that in all things you
[37:02] might receive glory and honor Lord in
[37:04] Jesus name he
[37:08] god bless you certainly good to be in
[37:11] the house of the Lord and good to be
[37:14] gathered with you this morning and I
[37:17] definitely can concur with brother Brian
[37:20] I think this is the third day of
[37:21] sunshine since since but we just welcome
[37:30] back sister Caroline amen it's so good
[37:35] to be in the house of the Lord and want
[37:38] to just mention to you Lord willing to
[37:40] be an email coming out to you of Senate
[37:43] and it should be coming out to you
[37:44] tomorrow brother Jason DeMars is gonna
[37:49] be here with us on this coming Thursday
[37:51] it's the first time brother Jason DeMars
[37:53] would have been here with us and what
[37:55] brother Jason DeMars he does mission
[37:59] work with the Persian countries and
[38:03] specifically Turkey with the Iranian
[38:06] refugees that are gathered there there's
[38:09] a video clip inside that message that
[38:12] will take you to YouTube and allow you
[38:15] to watch about 3035 minutes the film so
[38:18] you get a little bit of a background
[38:19] before brother Jason DeMars before he'll
[38:22] be here on this coming Thursday and I
[38:25] believe it would kind of help a little
[38:27] bit give a little bit more of a
[38:28] background and to see what God is doing
[38:30] one of the statistics that's on there
[38:32] that just it just was watching it again
[38:35] and looking at it there is approximately
[38:38] right now they they identify fifteen
[38:41] hundred believers in Iran fifteen
[38:45] hundred that's incredible
[38:48] in that video of the Persian Persia
[38:51] unveiled it takes you into the lives of
[38:54] some of those brothers who are one or
[38:58] two of them are actually pastors there
[39:00] in Turkey and actually what they had to
[39:03] go through in the Iranian prison that
[39:05] you usually don't come out of and such a
[39:08] testimony of the power of God of how the
[39:10] Lord moved there and then you these are
[39:13] brothers and the work that God has put
[39:16] that burden upon brother Jason to Mars
[39:17] and we so thank God for that don't leave
[39:20] we need each and every one and it
[39:22] certainly is a body and we just thank
[39:24] God for His grace and so this morning
[39:27] let's look into the word and Exodus
[39:34] chapter 3 now wasn't intended on this I
[39:43] actually you may times you hear me say
[39:45] this and with his only work hit a little
[39:47] Paul's button from where we were going
[39:50] on these previous Sunday's the Spirit of
[39:53] the Lord directed me down this this
[39:55] pathway in the channel we started
[39:56] looking at it on Thursday night and I
[39:59] want to follow up with this starting out
[40:01] here this morning on victory over
[40:04] discouragement so evidently God knows he
[40:09] knows what we need so if he says pause
[40:11] and go this direction we just obey Him
[40:14] amen
[40:15] is that right I mean if you order a
[40:18] hamburger and I bring you our chicken
[40:19] you're gonna say this you've got the
[40:20] order wrong right
[40:22] I can only serve the food he only fixes
[40:26] what we have need of verse 11 just two
[40:33] verse description will let you have your
[40:34] seats and Moses said unto God Who am I
[40:39] that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I
[40:43] should bring forth the children of
[40:44] Israel out of Egypt and he said
[40:48] certainly I will be with thee and this
[40:52] shall be a token unto thee that I have
[40:55] sent thee when thou has brought forth
[40:59] the people out of Egypt ye shall serve
[41:03] God upon this mountain I want you to
[41:07] notice this certainly I will be with
[41:11] thee and this shall be a token a sign a
[41:15] distinguishing mark unto you that I have
[41:18] cynthy when thou has brought forth the
[41:22] people out of Egypt ye shall serve God
[41:25] upon this mountain may God bless his
[41:29] word bless you as you're being seated
[41:34] we started looking at this on Thursday
[41:36] night and I'm gonna run order willing
[41:38] this will run a little bit of a
[41:39] different angle here
[41:43] discouragement itself is something that
[41:47] every one of us face have faced and will
[41:53] face there's things that we would love
[41:57] to be able to look at and be able to
[42:00] have something in this life to say I'll
[42:05] never be discouraged but that longing
[42:07] them that we have there is a place where
[42:10] they will no longer be any
[42:12] discouragement but yet it's just like
[42:16] everything else it's many times how we
[42:19] look at it you know sometimes there's
[42:21] things that God will do to direct us and
[42:23] instruct us and guide us in his word
[42:25] tell us don't do this do that and we
[42:28] need that God will also lead us and
[42:30] guide us and show us truth on how that
[42:32] we ought to be looking at things within
[42:35] his word and then there's times that God
[42:36] will move back and actually show us in
[42:39] his word how that some of the behind the
[42:42] scenes and how things are working and
[42:44] how that we and ourselves need to
[42:46] actually look and conduct ourselves in
[42:48] these times the one thing about it is
[42:50] that we realize that it falls to us in
[42:54] the midst when discouragement comes that
[42:56] it falls to us what are we going to do
[42:59] about it when discouragement does come
[43:01] and it should ought to be a question
[43:03] that resolved or resound in our hearts
[43:05] what what do I do when discouragement
[43:08] comes and I think no doubt that probably
[43:10] every one of us as believers we would
[43:12] know that the real resource and what we
[43:15] need to go to is the Word of God but
[43:18] sometimes even when we go to the Word of
[43:20] God we go back to the word and we come
[43:23] with our same mold of thinking our same
[43:26] thinking that has been a channel and
[43:28] pathway that has actually got us to
[43:31] where we're at the word met the Word of
[43:33] God itself never leads us to
[43:36] discouragement but the Word of God
[43:38] itself if within our channel if our
[43:41] channel isn't exactly properly correct
[43:44] then
[43:44] it has to be realigned and remoulded in
[43:47] order that God's Word can go forward so
[43:50] when we look at this here this morning
[43:52] you see within Moses life and you know
[43:55] to receive victory in the midst of
[43:58] discouragement just turn these down just
[44:00] a little bit Ben please just a tad bit
[44:02] we would see that in discouragement to
[44:05] really receive victory over
[44:07] discouragement it's by the Word of God
[44:09] and when you look at how that God was
[44:12] speaking here is the Lord speaking to
[44:14] Moses personally he knows that God is
[44:16] talking to him he knows that God is
[44:18] calling him for the duty but yet in the
[44:21] midst of this time he says Who am I so
[44:24] here Moses is in a place where he has
[44:26] come to a place to know and recognize
[44:29] his own human weakness and within that
[44:33] God would would as see fit that Moses by
[44:37] the way I am certainly going to be with
[44:40] you and this is gonna be assigned to you
[44:42] a token I'm gonna bring you right back
[44:44] to this place and that'll be a sign that
[44:47] I've sent you now my question is did
[44:50] Moses not know that God was sending him
[44:52] he did when he got down to Egypt did he
[44:55] not know that God had sent him he did he
[44:58] knew that God had sent him but Moses God
[45:01] is mindful and God is showing to us his
[45:04] faithfulness and mindfulness of our
[45:07] frailty and our frame that God would
[45:10] actually provide tokens signs that would
[45:14] actually speak back to us now think of
[45:16] it this mountain itself was not a
[45:19] mountain that would talk but yet when
[45:21] Moses would come back to this place to
[45:24] think of it the journeying out of Egypt
[45:27] and and things that they had went
[45:28] through within just those few chapters
[45:30] and to come back to this moment
[45:33] and yet when notice when Moses would
[45:35] come to this place it would be something
[45:37] when he would get there that seeing that
[45:40] mountain it would actually be able to
[45:42] refresh him it would encourage and now
[45:46] most of you know even when you've
[45:47] started out some of you were schooling
[45:49] some of you on your job and maybe you're
[45:51] on training and some of you you just get
[45:53] married and other things come along and
[45:56] you know it's helpful
[45:57] you receive encouragement bet you're on
[46:00] the right pathway it encourages you when
[46:03] when certain things are let known like
[46:04] hey I think that you're doing really
[46:06] well here on that drywall all the
[46:07] mudding and all of these things are
[46:09] going well or hey you know what you
[46:11] stabbed that person good with the needle
[46:13] you did exactly right
[46:14] all of those things are necessary to
[46:17] encourage us we we look for those
[46:19] encouraging things and you know what God
[46:22] knows now you can look at it and say oh
[46:24] Samuel I don't need any encouragement
[46:25] you're lying you do need encouragement I
[46:28] need encouragement all around us we have
[46:31] all sorts of things that would actually
[46:34] if we focus on it it could actually so
[46:38] discourage us and drive us into such a
[46:40] depression and when I look at this
[46:42] throughout the journey that even when he
[46:44] would see this you know sometimes
[46:46] there's things you can just look at and
[46:48] it will actually help you with what
[46:50] you're going through how many times
[46:53] brother branham said all of those things
[46:55] he says I have pictures of my hunts I
[46:58] had trophies mountain and he said
[47:01] sometimes when there's such chaos going
[47:03] on in the house from people coming in
[47:05] and out I slept down he said to that din
[47:08] and I'll just think back to those hunts
[47:11] he said then he said I'll look at that
[47:13] picture and I'll see that brother and
[47:15] that brother was with me on the hunt and
[47:17] then I remember how God met that need
[47:19] and I remember and he says bout that
[47:21] time he said it Julian takes a couple of
[47:23] them
[47:23] he said I'm back up there on the first
[47:25] floor and I'm ready to start ministering
[47:27] the needs again see God knows how to
[47:29] encourage you and I now I want to just
[47:33] look at this example here you know
[47:35] brother branham here he was in a time in
[47:37] his ministry and you know it probably
[47:39] would be something for you and I that
[47:41] maybe we would be able to easier
[47:43] understand it if it had been something
[47:45] that had taken place in his life where
[47:47] this complex had been built before the
[47:50] seals were open but it wasn't it was
[47:52] something that had been developed over
[47:54] time and it actually came to an apex to
[47:57] a point after the seals were open where
[47:59] the brother man will actually talk about
[48:01] it three months after the seals have
[48:03] been open and it begins to go through
[48:05] what has taken place within his life and
[48:08] now one thing that we look
[48:10] brother BAM here he is in the midst of
[48:11] this time and I'm just gonna refer to it
[48:13] he talks about how that God had spoke to
[48:16] him and said I'm gonna give you an
[48:17] everlasting sign and brother BAM is
[48:19] driving along the roadway and he says
[48:21] Lord where is that everlasting sign that
[48:24] you've told me about and brother bam is
[48:27] driving along through there and he said
[48:29] the Lord spoke to him and said I'm gonna
[48:30] give you an everlasting sign and blow
[48:33] them said he said that again and he said
[48:34] he told me look westward from where
[48:38] you're at notice where that where it was
[48:40] pointed to sign the sign was not pointed
[48:42] back east
[48:43] the sign was pointed westward you see
[48:47] many of the times when we're looking at
[48:49] it it's it's moving on when God is
[48:52] showing us these signs even and bringing
[48:54] Moses back to this mountain he's gone
[48:57] down to Egypt the people are brought
[48:59] back to this mountain it'll be a token
[49:01] to you it'll be assigned to you upon
[49:03] seeing this mountain where was this
[49:05] mountain this mountain was in the
[49:07] pathway a necessary stop in as Wednesday
[49:11] were coming to the promised land and
[49:13] here God tells the Prophet in the midst
[49:16] of this time to look over there to your
[49:19] West and where you're at and brother
[49:20] brems said I you know he said I just you
[49:22] know he said I just felt the Spirit of
[49:24] the Lord now slowed down the truck and I
[49:26] looked over and I saw a mountain with
[49:29] Whitecaps on it and I said I don't see
[49:31] no everlasting sign about that now hope
[49:35] you're with me he looked at that
[49:37] mountain and said I don't see no
[49:39] everlasting sign about that oh god help
[49:42] us to be honest it's just like when
[49:45] somebody saw oh yeah yeah I see it I see
[49:46] it I see I see what are you seeing I
[49:49] don't know but I see what you're saying
[49:51] no you don't just be honest do you know
[49:53] it's like sending in the in in the
[49:55] museum and they're saying oh did you see
[49:57] that cow that's sitting under that tree
[49:59] yeah yeah yeah where's it at underneath
[50:01] the tree oh come on somebody but you see
[50:07] the Prophet this is what I want you to
[50:09] don't miss this he's being honest I
[50:12] don't see this as an everlasting sign he
[50:15] just sees a mountain but notice when God
[50:18] moves on the scene it's now going to be
[50:22] a personal everlasting sign to him oh my
[50:27] god tells him your name is wrote all
[50:31] over it I thought what is it brother
[50:33] Brent says started getting real weak and
[50:35] you know he said he'd talks about how
[50:36] perspiration started to break out on his
[50:38] hands and he's begin to recognize at
[50:40] just that moment but the Rebbe says
[50:42] where I had failed God and how that I
[50:44] had let down on on things and brother
[50:47] Adam goes into talking about how that
[50:49] the peaks of this mountain and what he's
[50:52] seen here on this mountain and the Lord
[50:54] tells him in this place here he tells
[50:57] him he says he said to me that let that
[51:00] stand that mountain if there ever is
[51:03] ever a doubt in your mind remember this
[51:06] place come back here God gave him a
[51:13] place to come back to if you ever get
[51:15] doubt in your mind come back to this
[51:17] place I'll tell you what it wouldn't
[51:19] matter if there's an airline ticket cost
[51:21] a thousand dollars it would be worth it
[51:24] come on some but this because this is
[51:26] talking about the life and the
[51:29] commissioning the ministry right here if
[51:31] you ever doubt it come back to this
[51:33] place aren't you glad that God gives you
[51:35] a marker aren't you glad that you got a
[51:38] marker you can come back to to know
[51:41] where you've met God and different
[51:43] things that God has done in your life
[51:45] markers you can come back to who gave
[51:49] you those markers God did now look how
[51:53] brother branham is reading here in the
[51:55] message the 3rd Exodus he's just read
[51:57] the text here in the message the 3rd
[51:59] Exodus and brother man makes this
[52:01] statement he says not noticing before
[52:03] but feeling very deeply inspired of the
[52:06] Spirit this morning I just caught that
[52:09] then about serving God upon this
[52:11] mountain God sending his servant back
[52:14] where he had run from he give him the
[52:16] sign of a mountain never noticed it till
[52:20] just then this will be an eternal token
[52:24] unto you he's reading the text and you
[52:27] can hear it in the message he stops us I
[52:30] never noticed it till now you see what's
[52:32] happening he's already come now standing
[52:35] in
[52:35] jeffersonville but now in the midst of
[52:37] this time he solved the sign affair but
[52:40] being a true word prophet it's also got
[52:42] to be identified in the scriptures come
[52:44] on somebody it's got to be identified in
[52:47] the scriptures and here God confirming
[52:50] it there and then God letting it be
[52:52] known right here in the word I have
[52:54] brought you back to this mountain and
[52:57] this is where you'll serve me in the
[53:00] message indictment or the random watch
[53:02] these words he says now take us Lord
[53:05] mould us Lord take me with them I want
[53:11] to go with them I'm going up to Calvary
[53:15] now Lord by faith you don't get away
[53:18] from Calvary you got to go back to
[53:21] Calvary amen because that's where the
[53:24] work is finished
[53:26] Amen when Paul would speak in Hebrews 12
[53:30] looking unto Jesus the author and
[53:33] finisher of our faith
[53:34] remember it was the prophets and has the
[53:37] children of God if we can only get
[53:39] caught up into that realm he said where
[53:42] you can look in that bloodstream and
[53:44] recognize as a son and daughter of God
[53:46] that your sins are completely gone and
[53:49] you stand as a son and daughter of God
[53:52] in the presence of God and then to think
[53:54] here in the taking of the book in this
[53:57] hour where he's already paid the price
[53:59] but now the lamb comes on the scene he
[54:02] takes the book it's a finishing up her
[54:04] redemption what does he do he reveals
[54:06] himself as the Lamb that has been slain
[54:10] there was blood all over this lamb hey
[54:14] man it is a time of the fullness of
[54:18] redemption where is it going back to
[54:22] Calvary understand down through the ages
[54:26] this this message we've received what
[54:29] did it have it had to be a restoring
[54:31] there were things that were lost there
[54:34] were past that were taken down through
[54:37] the way but we had to go back to the
[54:40] real starting point we didn't go back to
[54:44] the starting point of some Mannesmann
[54:48] we have taken clear back to the very
[54:50] mind of Almighty God and we see that
[54:53] same pathway that moved down through
[54:55] Paul's ministry so much that the Prophet
[54:58] could say I have preached what Paul
[55:00] preached and we said we're resting on
[55:03] that revelation is that right a lot of
[55:08] pathways a lot of angles
[55:10] no wonder the Prophet would tell us he
[55:14] says if you read the Bible and you don't
[55:17] see Jesus Christ in every verse come
[55:20] back to this message Christ is the
[55:23] mystery of God revealed go back and read
[55:27] the Bible again well how do you have to
[55:30] read it you've got to read it through a
[55:32] remoted way you miss me so to think of
[55:38] this the words that the Prophet would
[55:40] use now take us Lord mould us take me
[55:44] with them I'm going up to Calvary now
[55:48] Lord by faith I'm going with this
[55:50] congregation now just mold me over Lord
[55:54] I've did wrong now think of this here
[55:57] here recently I was going to just quit
[56:00] preaching the people wouldn't hear me
[56:02] they just kept on doing the same thing I
[56:06] got discouraged I built a complex now
[56:12] think of it he's preaching he's pouring
[56:15] his heart out he's putting listen
[56:17] everything you sacrificed it's wrapped
[56:20] up in this and what he's saying instead
[56:22] of seeing fruit actually being produced
[56:24] he's actually having people stand
[56:26] against him he's having them tell him
[56:28] you know what brother mom's coming to
[56:30] town pin your hairs up cuz we don't want
[56:31] him to preach in about cut hair just pin
[56:33] it up come on somebody they were going
[56:37] you see they weren't welcoming and
[56:39] notice it was discouraging you know
[56:41] matter of fact brother rod said here I
[56:43] have been in my life he said times I
[56:45] walked out of a meeting after the
[56:47] discernment has taken place on the
[56:49] platform he said they take me out
[56:50] putting me in the car he said I'm set
[56:52] they're kind of betwixt two places and I
[56:54] would hear people walk right by the
[56:56] that said in the meeting and say that
[56:59] what nothing but a bunch of psychology
[57:01] tonight and brother man said I thought
[57:03] God why are you letting me do this why
[57:06] are you letting me put myself out here
[57:08] like this he got discouraged and so with
[57:16] discouragement this is one of the things
[57:18] that has to be watched for he built a
[57:21] complex he didn't blame it on the devil
[57:27] are you with me he built it and a
[57:32] complex itself is a way of thinking you
[57:35] know but these are not just definitions
[57:37] but even how brother Bram would go
[57:38] through it and explain it it's a way of
[57:40] thinking it's a mold you get into it's a
[57:45] casted you just revert right back to it
[57:47] it's a complex but brother and notice he
[57:51] says Oh God a couple Sundays ago when
[57:55] you give me that sign out there and
[57:57] reading a Bible see you told Moses just
[58:01] as that dream was that there was a
[58:03] mountain too and it would be assigned to
[58:06] him and then right at the end of it - no
[58:09] I had left a lot of sick people a
[58:11] ministry not only in the prophetic but
[58:14] in teaching the word and praying for the
[58:16] sick HUC be objective within it God's
[58:20] program cannot be stopped but what was
[58:22] the objective
[58:23] just get him discouraged like what's the
[58:27] use what's the point don't you realize
[58:30] that's exactly the way the devil will
[58:32] fight you he will get you looking at
[58:35] y'all your failures and all your
[58:36] mistakes all your shortcomings he'll get
[58:39] you looking at everything else
[58:40] what's the use I tell you what's to use
[58:42] the Eternity is what's the use is to be
[58:46] with the Lord Jesus and to have his
[58:48] peace his comfort his direction his
[58:51] guidance right now but when a person
[58:55] becomes discouraged oh my it's a
[58:57] desperate thing they're very despondent
[58:59] it's almost like you can talk to them
[59:01] and you're just talking to a wall
[59:03] because it just seems like words are not
[59:05] penetrating but I am so glad that God
[59:08] know
[59:09] just exactly what you and I have need of
[59:12] it and what we have to say lord help me
[59:15] to catch it help me to receive it just
[59:17] like the Prophet said I don't see no
[59:19] everlasting sign about that but after
[59:21] God got ahold of that mountain then it
[59:24] became a sign to him you know what he
[59:27] could ride by that mountain and that
[59:28] mountain would preach to him come on
[59:32] somebody it was a sign when Moses got
[59:35] back to Sonya he got back to Horeb that
[59:37] mountain would preach to it I've sent
[59:40] you I've called you I've given you the
[59:43] strength all this way you say what would
[59:45] that do that would refresh Moses just
[59:47] say I'm ready to get up and go again no
[59:52] wonder we need encouragement Romans
[59:57] chapter 12 verse 1 I beseech you
[59:59] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[1:00:01] that ye present your bodies a living
[1:00:05] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:00:11] is your reasonable service and be not
[1:00:15] conformed to this world who's he talking
[1:00:20] to
[1:00:21] brethren he didn't say unbelievers he
[1:00:28] doesn't say the carnal believers yet
[1:00:30] this very same text of Scripture can be
[1:00:33] taken and preached for the new birth and
[1:00:36] this very same text of Scripture can be
[1:00:40] taken and ministered to you and I if you
[1:00:43] have been born again of the Spirit of
[1:00:45] God from your soul you recognize that in
[1:00:48] your soul it's sealed away but you
[1:00:50] recognize I must be careful and not be
[1:00:54] conformed to the world in my thinking
[1:00:57] it's so easy for things just to sweep
[1:01:00] but this is why Paul goes on to say to
[1:01:04] the Brethren but be ye transformed by
[1:01:08] the renewing of your mind you know every
[1:01:12] once in a while if God carries this
[1:01:14] Saints will have to be renewed but the
[1:01:17] renewing of the sanctuary ain't tearing
[1:01:19] it down and down and building it back
[1:01:20] again it just means when
[1:01:23] have to have new cushions have to have
[1:01:24] new carpet maybe have to have new paint
[1:01:26] we need to renovate renew it why that
[1:01:34] you may prove what is that good and
[1:01:35] acceptable and perfect will of God now
[1:01:40] let's take another example here this
[1:01:43] morning a man by the name of Elijah look
[1:01:52] in the scriptures of many tremendous
[1:01:55] things that God used that spoke through
[1:02:00] Elijah and here you find in the opening
[1:02:04] of chapter 19 verse 1 this has happened
[1:02:07] right after Mount Carmel Mount Carmel
[1:02:12] has just taken place even after Mount
[1:02:15] Carmel Elijah has already ran ahead to
[1:02:18] Jezreel and met 1/2 as he was entering
[1:02:20] back in there he's already let him know
[1:02:22] that the abundance of rain I hear it and
[1:02:25] it's coming and you know what's
[1:02:28] tremendous powerful things that's
[1:02:31] already been apart and accompaniment in
[1:02:33] Elijah's ministry to see what took place
[1:02:36] on Mount Carmel Maya what a wonderful
[1:02:38] wonderful thing but it wasn't just
[1:02:40] something to be looked upon but God had
[1:02:43] a reason for doing that because remember
[1:02:46] the children of Israel right and mixed
[1:02:49] all around there they were halting
[1:02:51] between two opinions and God knows
[1:02:54] exactly how to bring the heart around of
[1:02:57] his children and the only way his heart
[1:03:00] of his children would be brought around
[1:03:01] it's not going to be by words his
[1:03:03] children will be brought around by him
[1:03:05] and he is the word so the word itself it
[1:03:09] is a person it's not just words that
[1:03:11] will turn it around
[1:03:12] listen if words can turn you around then
[1:03:15] Seminary preachers could help you out
[1:03:17] but words alone can never turn you
[1:03:19] around
[1:03:20] it takes the very power of God moving
[1:03:22] behind that word and that word to be
[1:03:25] made alive and it deals personally with
[1:03:27] your heart and you know it's not a man
[1:03:29] speaking but you know that it's God
[1:03:31] that's speaking to your heart it's just
[1:03:33] a direct
[1:03:34] communication and channel between you
[1:03:36] and the Lord now watch this here at
[1:03:39] first Kings chapter 19 verse 1 and they
[1:03:42] had told Jezebel all that Elijah had
[1:03:45] done and withal how he had slain all the
[1:03:48] prophets with the sword
[1:03:49] that's guy I don't even gonna preach on
[1:03:51] this right now but what a crybaby
[1:03:55] you know who's running that household
[1:03:58] but I'm going there today verse two then
[1:04:03] Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah
[1:04:06] saying so let the gods do to me and more
[1:04:09] also if I make not thy life as the life
[1:04:13] of one of them by tomorrow about this
[1:04:16] time and when he saw that he arose and
[1:04:21] went for his life and came to bare Sheba
[1:04:25] which belongs to Judah and left his
[1:04:28] servant there so he makes he comes back
[1:04:32] into Judah you know brother BAM when he
[1:04:34] deals with it and you look at those two
[1:04:35] spirits coming up even through the
[1:04:37] church age their brother BAM said
[1:04:38] between that of Judah and that of is Ray
[1:04:40] said Judah was always the more spiritual
[1:04:42] line very much like the true vine you
[1:04:46] with me so here notice when he is when
[1:04:49] he is pursued by Jezebel he comes back
[1:04:52] into bear Sheva he comes to a place that
[1:04:55] is actually occupied and a part of Judas
[1:04:59] inheritance and he leaves his servant
[1:05:01] there you know his servant no doubt was
[1:05:04] a great companion to him it was someone
[1:05:06] he could you know that would help him
[1:05:07] someone that would minister to his needs
[1:05:09] someone that could actually talk to him
[1:05:11] in different times but this time it was
[1:05:14] something that even his servant himself
[1:05:16] was not able to help Elisha it was
[1:05:19] something to wear that his servant was
[1:05:21] left right there you know even within
[1:05:23] our lives sometimes even when we look at
[1:05:25] it between husbands and wives and you
[1:05:27] know it's such a wonderful thing to be
[1:05:29] able to have that companionship and be
[1:05:31] able to minister to one another and you
[1:05:33] know sometimes the ministry from husband
[1:05:35] to wife and watch the husband is simply
[1:05:37] not about even saying anything it's
[1:05:39] simply just about being there no don't
[1:05:43] preach with me it's simply just about
[1:05:46] being there it simply may be just
[1:05:48] no a touch on the hand it simply maybe
[1:05:50] just you know just in just helping them
[1:05:52] through it because sometimes people
[1:05:54] don't feel like talking now I'm not the
[1:05:59] only one or is everybody else in here
[1:06:00] like that way sometimes as well don't
[1:06:03] raise your hands I know you I'm your
[1:06:04] pastor and I can tell you right now
[1:06:07] sometimes you don't feel like talking it
[1:06:09] might be such a situation that's
[1:06:11] happened in your life but you know what
[1:06:13] you realize it ain't the time to talk
[1:06:15] right now
[1:06:17] hello it's being sensitive it's waiting
[1:06:20] on God to know when do we move what do
[1:06:23] we do in that time let me tell you
[1:06:25] something that's the same way it is in
[1:06:26] your home that's between a husband and a
[1:06:29] wife and even with your children or
[1:06:30] grandchildren
[1:06:31] it isn't always johnny-on-the-spot
[1:06:33] acting when you feel like you have the
[1:06:35] word but you also have to have the right
[1:06:37] spirit to go along with the word
[1:06:39] sometimes it's not even about what you
[1:06:42] say it's you yourself in the way that
[1:06:44] you can create an atmosphere by having
[1:06:47] the word so in your heart and in your
[1:06:49] life that you can actually make such a
[1:06:51] melody and create such an atmosphere
[1:06:53] that it will change things in that home
[1:06:56] and there's also times that you know
[1:07:00] what you need to get away
[1:07:02] Loredana knows we're going this way but
[1:07:04] you need to get away there's some times
[1:07:09] that I just I need to go mow the grass
[1:07:10] sometimes I need to go put my hands in
[1:07:13] the dirt now I know for some of you
[1:07:15] that's work but for me that that's
[1:07:17] relaxation where I can get out there in
[1:07:19] my mind I think I think so good when you
[1:07:21] know when either I've got a bow a gun or
[1:07:23] my hands are in the dirt around my house
[1:07:24] I think so good in the midst of that
[1:07:27] time and there's some times where I just
[1:07:30] need alone time brothers can you say
[1:07:37] Amen sometimes your wife will look at
[1:07:43] you and say what do you thinking about
[1:07:44] nothing impossible for you but not for
[1:07:49] me
[1:07:49] I'm in a wonderful place called nothing
[1:07:52] land what's there nothing
[1:07:57] nothing and it's wonderful this sounds
[1:08:06] silly it might sound silly and it might
[1:08:08] sound simple but the reality of it is
[1:08:11] it's very important that we understand
[1:08:14] these things now notice this he went a
[1:08:20] day's journey into the wilderness now
[1:08:23] you see it would look like this is
[1:08:25] entirely when we see it why is he going
[1:08:28] off and leaving his servant but he's in
[1:08:30] a place right now
[1:08:31] he's so despondent of what has taken
[1:08:34] place and he goes off into the
[1:08:36] wilderness and the Bible says he came
[1:08:38] and he sat down under a juniper tree I
[1:08:42] don't know if y'all ever looked this up
[1:08:44] but I was just looking at this again the
[1:08:46] juniper tree I don't know how to really
[1:08:49] lock in it to a tree that we have here
[1:08:51] but it looks to be a tree that might be
[1:08:53] you know in height as far as maybe with
[1:08:55] you know sometimes it's not real tall
[1:08:57] but it's real spread out it has a real
[1:08:59] spread canopy where you can really get a
[1:09:02] lot of shade underneath it it's a
[1:09:04] welcome sign of refreshment and rest and
[1:09:07] here he finds a juniper tree and he goes
[1:09:11] some sets under it and he requested for
[1:09:13] himself that he might die he's in
[1:09:18] trouble he's in trouble
[1:09:21] and same way with you and I when we get
[1:09:26] off to ourselves we can get in trouble
[1:09:31] come on somebody you said brother seven
[1:09:34] women I thought you just talked about
[1:09:36] sometimes getting alone but getting
[1:09:38] alone with who getting alone with who
[1:09:44] sometimes this is of this is something
[1:09:47] that's very it's not good you know the
[1:09:49] Bible said it's not good that man should
[1:09:51] be alone and that word good in the
[1:09:54] Hebrew is spelled be a V it's not good
[1:10:00] that man should be alone the word alone
[1:10:03] nothing word good sorry the word alone
[1:10:05] is spelled BA D it's bad
[1:10:11] and he requested for himself that he
[1:10:16] might die and said it is enough now O
[1:10:18] Lord take my life for I am NOT better
[1:10:22] than my father's aren't you glad that
[1:10:24] you don't hold the keys you're not going
[1:10:29] nowhere till God is finished and you
[1:10:33] better make sure that you're always
[1:10:34] ready to go because you never know when
[1:10:39] you're finished there's none of you have
[1:10:42] or me included don't even have the
[1:10:44] guarantee of tomorrow or even hours from
[1:10:47] now I don't care how young you are you
[1:10:49] don't have no guarantee you need to make
[1:10:52] sure that you are ready to go and ready
[1:10:55] to go means that you are so locked in
[1:10:59] that the reason that I'm here in this
[1:11:02] life is to serve his purpose I'm not
[1:11:05] here for me I'm not here for any other
[1:11:08] reason I'm here to serve his purpose
[1:11:14] Lord let me die let me go home Lord I'm
[1:11:18] no better than my father's and as he lay
[1:11:22] and slept under a juniper tree behold
[1:11:26] then an angel touched him and said unto
[1:11:30] Him arise and eat you let him sleep that
[1:11:39] he's came and touched him rise eat a
[1:11:46] hoot and behold there was cake Baken on
[1:11:50] the coals and a cruse of water and his
[1:11:56] head he didn't even have to leave his
[1:12:00] bedroom and go to the kitchen table it
[1:12:03] was right there right beside him the
[1:12:07] nourishment he needed was right beside
[1:12:11] him and they angel touched him
[1:12:18] I'd wake up eat drink take nourishment I
[1:12:27] just set up no doubt he's in such a
[1:12:33] condition right now
[1:12:34] he don't know is it Tuesday is it
[1:12:38] Wednesday
[1:12:38] well Sunday just yesterday you don't
[1:12:42] know but God said I'm not asking you
[1:12:47] what day it is this is all I want you to
[1:12:49] do right now
[1:12:50] rise up eat and then I'm gonna put you
[1:12:54] back to sleep god knows what he needed
[1:13:01] he didn't need a sermon right now come
[1:13:05] on somebody
[1:13:06] he was completely washed out as a matter
[1:13:10] of fact brother better put it like this
[1:13:12] his nerves were already overworked he is
[1:13:16] having a breakdown
[1:13:19] but LEM said he was frustrated
[1:13:21] he said the Elijah was in a place that
[1:13:24] many of us get into many times let me
[1:13:30] read a few of those places we get into
[1:13:33] them at different times he tells us even
[1:13:36] warns us as ministers and I believe it's
[1:13:38] fitting to us as people of God but them
[1:13:42] says you watch after your Mount Carmel
[1:13:44] experiences he said you watch you're
[1:13:47] gonna have a juniper tree wherever a man
[1:13:50] has a blessing and the power of God
[1:13:52] pulls down and does something look out
[1:13:55] Satan's on the track remember the next
[1:13:57] day Monday after a good day on Sunday
[1:14:00] it's gonna be a hard thing because he's
[1:14:03] going to do everything he can to knock
[1:14:05] the confidence out of you that the Holy
[1:14:07] Spirit instilled in you his nerves were
[1:14:16] already shot mr. Behm says now he said
[1:14:23] there's men that can overworked
[1:14:24] themselves
[1:14:26] they don't say Millennials but it says
[1:14:28] there's men that can under work
[1:14:29] themselves some of you'll get that
[1:14:35] there's some that are overworked and
[1:14:37] some that are under work come on
[1:14:40] somebody they'll name nobody's names but
[1:14:43] you notice boo damn goes on to this he
[1:14:45] said you know he said God's got a
[1:14:48] juniper tree in those times or else
[1:14:51] they're gonna go to pieces but them so
[1:14:53] we all hit them experiences it always
[1:14:56] said but the mercy of Jehovah to his
[1:14:58] servant God knows your trials he knows
[1:15:01] all about it and he comes down he said
[1:15:03] he knows his servant needs some rest
[1:15:05] he just put him to sleep for a while and
[1:15:08] why is laying there waiting to
[1:15:09] recuperate or praying to die
[1:15:12] Blue Diamond goes on and into places
[1:15:14] like this and and I read from this so to
[1:15:17] understand brother Bram said there is
[1:15:19] the grace of God to his servant resting
[1:15:22] him now if I asked you what spiritual
[1:15:26] about this event you tell how they angel
[1:15:28] touched him the cakes are spiritual to
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:35] sleeping is needful to if he don't get
[1:15:39] nourishment and he don't get rest he'll
[1:15:42] be no count come on somebody God knows
[1:15:48] this he'll be no count he needs rest
[1:15:52] so God don't keep waking him up and say
[1:15:54] hey Eliza I want to tell you know he
[1:15:57] just wakes him up long enough to feed
[1:15:59] him and then he puts him back down to
[1:16:01] sleep
[1:16:04] what's God doing well he knows what he's
[1:16:06] doing
[1:16:07] this man's overworked come on somebody
[1:16:12] buh-bam said these human bodies no
[1:16:15] wonder he said Jesus said come aside
[1:16:18] into the wilderness and let's rest and
[1:16:21] mother Graham says you know he said
[1:16:23] there's some guys that don't think they
[1:16:25] have to rest but we find out they burn
[1:16:27] out pretty quick if they don't take a
[1:16:29] rest they wreck up somewhere and that's
[1:16:32] where brother Billy Graham is that
[1:16:33] tonight trying to overshoot the mark
[1:16:35] these human bodies are strong but they
[1:16:38] need rest
[1:16:39] Oh mom brother mem says you need to take
[1:16:42] a little rest while he was laying then
[1:16:45] or the tree got quite and his nerves
[1:16:47] aren't you glad for that boo quite
[1:16:50] disturbs God did what kind of pills that
[1:16:57] gospel it platen his nerves it always
[1:17:04] amazed me you know my dad my dad could
[1:17:06] go to sleep at a drop the hand like this
[1:17:08] my dad I'm stressed I don't operate that
[1:17:13] way I'm stressed I'm walking and I need
[1:17:16] to go somewhere I need to do something
[1:17:19] when my dad could always just drop the
[1:17:21] head huh I'm discouraged I'm not built
[1:17:26] that way now maybe you are don't
[1:17:29] spiritualize it
[1:17:30] oh brother Samuel I'm more at rest
[1:17:33] don't try to spiritualize your
[1:17:34] sleepiness God quieten his nerves she
[1:17:39] fed him he woke him up again fed him
[1:17:41] again and put him back to sleep you mean
[1:17:47] God would treat a son of God like this
[1:17:49] yeah even a mature one God said you need
[1:17:55] a little mothering right now I'm gonna
[1:17:57] give you some mothering you stood for me
[1:18:00] I'm gonna stand by you in this time
[1:18:02] you've taken the heat you been under the
[1:18:05] pressure I'm gonna minister to your
[1:18:07] needs right now in this time brother
[1:18:09] brother said you know he said you find
[1:18:11] the time he said to where John Wesley
[1:18:13] had actually made a statement I'm afraid
[1:18:14] to rest I ain't got time to rest but the
[1:18:16] branch says you find yourself broke up

[1:18:38] ain't even clear up here it's right
[1:18:40] beside you right there all you have to
[1:18:43] do is rise and eat sometimes instead of
[1:18:50] juniper trees we make shopping malls

[1:18:57] never refresh you you know run your
[1:18:59] credit up come on friends sometimes you
[1:19:04] see what it is
[1:19:04] it's these these things that want to
[1:19:06] come out it Oh we'll just do this and
[1:19:08] just do that and just do this but
[1:19:11] realizing there is a place that you can
[1:19:14] really find nourishment and strength do
[1:19:17] you realize there sometimes I'm not
[1:19:19] going to ask you to raise your hand but
[1:19:20] every one of us have been at places
[1:19:23] maybe different levels of discouragement
[1:19:25] and sometimes you've been in places
[1:19:27] where you just don't have the duration
[1:19:30] to even be able to utter out a prayer
[1:19:32] but from your heart you'll say lord I
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:39] don't even have the words to put
[1:19:42] together help me Lord
[1:19:47] y'all repeater God and he's mindful of
[1:19:51] that right there to come and minister
[1:19:54] what we have need of though my notice
[1:19:59] here
[1:20:00] he took him up there was a cake Baken on
[1:20:02] the coals a crucifer at his head and he
[1:20:06] did eat and drink and laid him down
[1:20:07] again you know Elijah didn't even asked
[1:20:09] where did this come from
[1:20:10] this man had already been eating
[1:20:12] miracles hey man he already had Ravens
[1:20:17] showing up to his table already what
[1:20:19] would you like today on your bologna
[1:20:21] sandwich hallelujah he didn't have to go
[1:20:27] far to receive but what he did this is
[1:20:29] what I want you to catch what he did
[1:20:32] have to do is set up and eat he had to
[1:20:37] eat what was provided it wasn't a
[1:20:41] junction I don't feel like that right
[1:20:42] now no no he needed it and then he
[1:20:45] needed to go lay back down what's what
[1:20:48] God says to him in verse 7 and the age
[1:20:50] of the Lord came again the second time
[1:20:52] and touched him and said arise and eat
[1:20:57] because the journey is too great for
[1:21:01] thee
[1:21:04] so God has somewhere
[1:21:08] he's minded him to go Elijah doesn't see
[1:21:14] this right now but God tells him arise
[1:21:17] to meet the journey is too great for
[1:21:20] thee now watch this verse 8 he arose and
[1:21:23] did eat and drink and went in the
[1:21:27] strength of that meat forty days and
[1:21:31] forty nights that was more than organic
[1:21:37] and one grass-fed that was thrown fed
[1:21:39] right there he went in the strength of
[1:21:42] this meat forty days and forty nights
[1:21:46] but where did he go to unto Horeb the
[1:21:51] Mount of God
[1:21:52] where's he doing same place that Moses
[1:21:55] went back to he's coming back to the
[1:21:57] mountain of God where God's presence has
[1:22:00] set down I want you to watch this he's
[1:22:02] going back to sacred sands that's where
[1:22:06] the prophets said he said that when
[1:22:07] there's things that can arise about your
[1:22:10] life he said when doubts and fears can
[1:22:13] arise oh he said there's that certain
[1:22:15] place that you can always come back to
[1:22:18] that you know that you met God anybody
[1:22:24] know what I'm talking about house I'm
[1:22:26] not talking about an emotion I'm talking
[1:22:29] about you can go right back to where you
[1:22:31] know he changed your life and set it up
[1:22:34] on the throne of your heart and when
[1:22:38] things around you doubts and fears and
[1:22:41] everything else where do you go back to
[1:22:43] you go back to the sacred sands where
[1:22:46] the devil cannot put one of his feet
[1:22:50] that is a place reserved for you and God
[1:22:55] alone and sometimes you've got to
[1:22:58] revisit those sacred sands your honors
[1:23:01] brother branham in the message visions
[1:23:02] of william branham brother Branham was
[1:23:04] talking about the different visions
[1:23:05] remember how that they would come go
[1:23:06] pray for this one and so forth
[1:23:07] the one about mrs. mrs. cradles mrs.
[1:23:11] Kadel mrs. Cato's daughter and and she
[1:23:15] had wrote and said come to south
[1:23:16] Boston little badminton pack up in the
[1:23:18] car and they believe out of
[1:23:20] Jeffersonville and when they leave out a
[1:23:22] Jeffersonville they realize oh they come
[1:23:25] and reel us in in a place called South
[1:23:26] Boston it's called New Boston now this
[1:23:29] is what mrs. K towhead Road it's a place
[1:23:31] called South Boston but brother branham
[1:23:33] recognized when they got out of
[1:23:34] Jeffersonville they had went on a drive
[1:23:36] for so long and they realized that is
[1:23:39] not the way to get there it's actually
[1:23:41] New Boston so you know what brother
[1:23:45] Graham said he said we went back to
[1:23:47] Jeffersonville and started from there
[1:23:48] and there was somebody in Jeffersonville
[1:23:52] that knew about New Boston and they
[1:23:54] could tell us go here
[1:23:56] you say why didn't God lay that out like
[1:23:58] he did for the other visions god knows
[1:24:00] what he's doing to me them visions I
[1:24:02] preached sermons from their visions of a
[1:24:04] person's walk with God it shows even in
[1:24:06] their visions of how to be patient how
[1:24:08] to wait on God and even in that vision
[1:24:10] right there it shows that even when a
[1:24:12] direction had been taken out of
[1:24:14] Jeffersonville and yet they were headed
[1:24:16] in the wrong direction where did they go
[1:24:18] back they went back to Jeffersonville
[1:24:20] and started from there there are times
[1:24:23] where you and I have to go back and
[1:24:25] start from the foundation from the
[1:24:30] sacred sands think of this Elijah
[1:24:37] going back to this two mountain horrible
[1:24:40] now what if Elijah would eat this meal
[1:24:42] and just took off running somewhere else
[1:24:45] he ended up in the same and Ben stayed
[1:24:47] in the same condition he was in because
[1:24:49] after 40 days the strength was going to
[1:24:51] wear out you see it's what happens many
[1:24:54] times to us if we're not careful what
[1:24:57] God is moving and dealing in the life
[1:24:59] right there don't just rise up after God
[1:25:02] has nurtured you and fed you boy pre
[1:25:04] Scott I feel like going on I don't know
[1:25:07] go to Horeb if you don't get back to
[1:25:11] Horeb and get remoted and recast again
[1:25:15] you're going to end up in the same fix
[1:25:17] are you with me this is the Lord showing
[1:25:20] you and I teaching us you can go in that
[1:25:23] strip you can go a lot of places pray
[1:25:25] scholar I feel
[1:25:26] I feel wonderful and be careful if
[1:25:28] you're not careful in 40 days you'll be
[1:25:31] in the same fix why do I gotta go
[1:25:35] use the strength to get the horrible get
[1:25:39] back to sacred sands get back to a place
[1:25:42] where God can remote you let me tell you
[1:25:47] something you can make everything your
[1:25:48] refuge you can make your job your refuge
[1:25:50] you can try to drown out your problems
[1:25:52] you can try to put your head in the sand
[1:25:54] and pretend like things aren't going on
[1:25:56] but listen let me tell you something
[1:25:57] right now it's to receive nourishment
[1:25:59] within your heart taking in of the Word
[1:26:02] of God and really being nourished in the
[1:26:04] things of God and make your way to Mount
[1:26:06] Horeb to where that God Himself can
[1:26:09] speak to your heart and remote you once
[1:26:12] again now you know scholars say it
[1:26:18] actually is only about 11 or 12 days
[1:26:21] journey from where Elijah was at to
[1:26:26] Mount Horeb now some of them scholars
[1:26:30] save it and lied you're just kind of
[1:26:33] wandering around I'm not saying that
[1:26:35] because the Prophet don't say that
[1:26:38] because what I believe that he's going
[1:26:42] to Horeb and there's a place he's got to
[1:26:45] get there - horrible not just anywhere
[1:26:48] you see this is what it's important to
[1:26:50] know with what God is doing for you it's
[1:26:55] important to understand the nourishment
[1:26:57] he's given you notice and he came
[1:27:03] thither
[1:27:04] unto a cave and Lodge there and behold
[1:27:07] the word of the Lord came to him and
[1:27:09] said to him what doest thou here Elijah
[1:27:13] I don't believe for a moment that God
[1:27:17] was saying what are you doing here God
[1:27:20] was asking him not so that Elijah would
[1:27:24] be the one to tell him okay like I
[1:27:26] didn't realize while you were here
[1:27:27] know God's asking him to consider think
[1:27:32] what are you doing here
[1:27:37] remember the word of the Lord came to
[1:27:39] him in none of the previous verses the
[1:27:42] angel touched him he didn't say the word
[1:27:44] of the Lord came to him the angel just
[1:27:46] touched him woke him up said rise eat
[1:27:48] put him back to sleep woke up rise eat
[1:27:51] the journeys great for you put him back
[1:27:54] to sight but when he gets to Horeb the
[1:27:57] word of the Lord comes to him sometimes
[1:28:01] I've wondered and I think I understand
[1:28:03] as a pastor sometimes why I have to wait
[1:28:06] I understand sometimes why that you have
[1:28:12] to wait that sometimes we need nourished
[1:28:16] before we can ever ever be properly
[1:28:19] counseled because we're in no state of
[1:28:25] mind or demeanor to be counseled but God
[1:28:31] knows how to nourish strengthen and get
[1:28:34] you to wake and speak to you at Horeb
[1:28:37] aren't you glad for that glory be to God
[1:28:41] he knows how to bring us to that place
[1:28:43] because first of all he'll I just got to
[1:28:46] be nourished he's got to be refreshed
[1:28:49] before he can ever be remoted verse 10
[1:28:56] and he said I've been very jealous for
[1:29:00] the Lord God of hosts for the children
[1:29:05] of Israel have forsaken that covenant
[1:29:09] thrown down thine altars and slain by
[1:29:13] prophets with the sword and I even I
[1:29:16] only am left
[1:29:19] don't raise your hands but you've been
[1:29:22] there maybe you feel that way this
[1:29:25] morning I'm the only one that's where
[1:29:29] discouragement will get you now in this
[1:29:34] way in this way yet it's applied to our
[1:29:36] lives but yet with Elijah he says and
[1:29:40] they do seek my life Elijah what he's
[1:29:43] looking at and look listen what he's
[1:29:45] talking about is all that he has seen
[1:29:49] and experienced and yet Elijah is a man
[1:29:53] gifted by God to be able to see the
[1:29:57] unseen and isn't it striking how that
[1:30:02] God will allow you sometimes to see the
[1:30:04] unseen and then other times you don't
[1:30:08] see the unseen but what you don't see
[1:30:10] doesn't mean that something's not
[1:30:12] happening see God is teaching Elijah a
[1:30:19] lesson here and through this lesson it's
[1:30:21] something that can be ministered to you
[1:30:23] now he's actually trying to minister
[1:30:26] victory over discouragement the cakes
[1:30:28] the water all those things that was not
[1:30:31] the victory over discouragement I hope
[1:30:33] you're with me this morning you see if
[1:30:35] mail-id you would have said praise God
[1:30:37] manna I'm ready to go right now but he
[1:30:39] really wasn't feeling that way I'll read
[1:30:41] your statement here in a minute even
[1:30:42] when he got and left there from the
[1:30:44] right from the cakes in the water he
[1:30:46] still wasn't feeling that way at that
[1:30:48] time but if he would have mistaken that
[1:30:50] and just taken the cakes and the water
[1:30:53] and went he'd ended up in the same
[1:30:55] condition that he was in before but
[1:30:56] right here is where he actually needs to
[1:30:59] be remoted and you know God has a way of
[1:31:02] talking to you and I sometimes God can
[1:31:04] just come out and say things point-blank
[1:31:06] but then there's other times God knows
[1:31:07] how to speak to you and I that will get
[1:31:09] the point and it's scary we get the
[1:31:11] point in more and more than more ways
[1:31:13] than what words could say think about
[1:31:15] what Elijah has declared here that they
[1:31:18] have forsaken my covenant thrown down my
[1:31:20] altars slam the prophets I'm the only
[1:31:23] one left and they're seeking my life and
[1:31:25] the Bible says in verse 11 that he the
[1:31:28] Lord spoke to him and said go forth and
[1:31:30] stand
[1:31:31] on the Mount before the Lord and behold
[1:31:34] the Lord passed by God had a place that
[1:31:42] he wanted him to stand and the Lord
[1:31:45] passed by now what God is actually going
[1:31:49] to do here is reenact the effects of the
[1:31:52] passing of the Lord in Elijah's ministry
[1:31:56] he's actually speaking to Elijah so
[1:31:59] Elijah can understand it and here as the
[1:32:03] Lord passed by a great strong wind rent
[1:32:06] the mountains and break in pieces the
[1:32:10] rocks before the Lord but the Lord was
[1:32:14] not in the wind are you catching it he
[1:32:17] was not in the wind the wind had an
[1:32:20] effect on the rocks and renting the
[1:32:22] mountain but that was only because the
[1:32:25] Lord was passing by in Elijah's ministry
[1:32:29] the Lord passed by and the wind stirred
[1:32:34] up persecution the wind stirred up all
[1:32:39] of this tore moil against him but the
[1:32:46] Lord was not in the wind and after the
[1:32:49] wind an earthquake but the Lord was not
[1:32:51] in the earthquake and after the
[1:32:52] earthquake a fire but the Lord was not
[1:32:56] in the fire and after the fire a still
[1:33:00] small voice God has just laid out right
[1:33:11] here what has taken place in his
[1:33:13] ministry so far things that have
[1:33:18] happened you have stood for my word you
[1:33:20] have stood true to it
[1:33:21] it has turned Israel upside down they
[1:33:23] call you a fanatic they call you crank
[1:33:25] they call you old old old ball head all
[1:33:28] of these things they don't even want you
[1:33:29] as a matter of fact the first lady of
[1:33:31] the land said she's going to have you
[1:33:35] instead what should have brought liberty
[1:33:37] and blessing has caused you to run for
[1:33:41] your life
[1:33:42] I mean after all you just shared the
[1:33:45] gospel of Liberty and now they hate you
[1:33:48] they put you out don't want nothing to
[1:33:51] do with you they don't seem like that
[1:33:55] makes sense does it
[1:33:57] don't worry it didn't make sense for
[1:33:59] Elijah either don't worry you know if
[1:34:03] I'm making a statement I've got some
[1:34:04] things to read to you and it was so when
[1:34:09] Elijah heard it heard what the still
[1:34:12] small voice that he wrapped his face in
[1:34:16] his mantle and went out and stood in the
[1:34:18] entering in of the cave and behold there
[1:34:20] came a voice unto Him what does thou
[1:34:23] here Elijah and Elijah repeated the same
[1:34:26] thing that he had already said before
[1:34:27] and noticed this within the midst of it
[1:34:30] here if God this is a wonderful thing he
[1:34:33] has let he has let God know my zeal and
[1:34:36] my jealousy for you I am jealous and
[1:34:42] zealous for the message you have given
[1:34:46] me but if God don't help him his
[1:34:51] jealousy and his Selya sness has put him
[1:34:55] out here if God doesn't help him and
[1:35:00] realign him remote him recast him he'll
[1:35:05] remain out there but you see what God is
[1:35:11] doing God has allowed this time because
[1:35:14] he is actually teaching Elijah human
[1:35:18] weakness don't raise your hand nobody
[1:35:24] likes to have their human weakness
[1:35:26] exposed if God doesn't help him he's
[1:35:31] going to stay in seclusion no time goes
[1:35:33] on to talk about it like this and
[1:35:35] perfect strength I don't think I have
[1:35:36] these for you but I can get him to you
[1:35:38] tomorrow he said he had come to the end
[1:35:41] of his road then
[1:35:43] program said he was in pretty bad shape
[1:35:46] he had come to the end of his knowledge
[1:35:49] he didn't know what to do next
[1:35:52] I've done what you've told me to do Lord
[1:35:57] I stood by your word I've told the truth
[1:35:59] all of them's gone away there's nobody
[1:36:01] left here I ain't got anybody to preach
[1:36:04] to ask your logic if we could we could
[1:36:11] just if we could ask you Elijah Elijah
[1:36:13] what Mount Carmel what kind of meeting
[1:36:15] was ahead that was a flop
[1:36:17] I mean God came down the Lord really
[1:36:20] moved in such a way but he didn't see
[1:36:24] fruit y'all getting quiet on me he
[1:36:30] didn't see fruit do you realize he did
[1:36:34] not leave that mountain saying glory to
[1:36:36] God there's people right here that
[1:36:39] really believe it no he thinks he's the
[1:36:41] only one did you see zeal and jealousy
[1:36:46] for the Lord for the message is good but
[1:36:49] don't you let it get you off to yourself
[1:36:51] and so that you're the only one you
[1:36:56] better make a trip to Mount Horeb and
[1:36:58] ask God Lord remove me Lord God recast
[1:37:03] me because obviously the channel in the
[1:37:05] way that I'm going about it I am
[1:37:07] isolating myself because I am so jealous
[1:37:14] and zealous for the message discouraging
[1:37:25] how is it in your life when you don't
[1:37:27] see fruit that you think you want to see
[1:37:29] in your life
[1:37:29] encouraging or discouraging sometimes
[1:37:34] the hardest thing within our lives is to
[1:37:35] see our own growth sometimes it takes
[1:37:39] years to be able to look back and
[1:37:40] actually see you've grown because a lot
[1:37:44] of times but listen don't miss this the
[1:37:45] real first part where growth takes place
[1:37:47] is the same way it does when God is
[1:37:49] dealing with your heart to even bring
[1:37:51] you to the new birth it takes place on
[1:37:53] the inside to where you can even catch
[1:37:55] to where that how that you're even a pro
[1:37:57] and you're looking at things a whole lot
[1:37:59] differently than what you used to and
[1:38:02] then you see growth come out of your
[1:38:03] life think about this here he is he's so
[1:38:06] discouraged
[1:38:06] he's so despondent he's not seeing the
[1:38:09] people respond the way he thinks they
[1:38:10] ought to respond hey listen this happens
[1:38:12] to every officer in the church it
[1:38:14] happens to you it happens to song
[1:38:16] leaders and whatever more that's why
[1:38:18] it's very careful we must always be
[1:38:20] careful not to handle things out of
[1:38:22] discouragement the greatest thing I can
[1:38:25] do for you if I'm discouraged I maybe
[1:38:28] need to take a break and get somebody in
[1:38:29] here yeah good man is hard to tell what
[1:38:35] I'll do when I'm discouraged
[1:38:37] lord have mercy they won't even listen
[1:38:39] to me they asked me for advice they had
[1:38:42] never loosened me on squirming right now
[1:38:45] I better get somebody in huh I'm gonna
[1:38:49] say you know what I I'll just go down
[1:38:52] the brother Erikson for Sunday morning
[1:38:53] and get refreshed no with me
[1:38:59] discouragement is a real thing
[1:39:02] God's gotta help me hide you here he
[1:39:04] needs help
[1:39:09] brother Bram says it was then at this
[1:39:12] point he got weak yet standing true
[1:39:16] confessing his weakness and everything
[1:39:20] he's at a point let me die I know better
[1:39:23] than the rest of her but God said come
[1:39:26] on up on the mountain I'm gonna give you
[1:39:29] a new message I'm going to send you a
[1:39:31] new message now where the RAM said when
[1:39:34] God got done with him there on Horeb he
[1:39:36] said here he is he said he looks a mess
[1:39:38] he said how he's dressed he said an 80
[1:39:41] year old man he said but when he came
[1:39:43] off the mountain that day he said I'd
[1:39:45] say he act like he was 16 years old you
[1:39:47] know what it was the cakes the water got
[1:39:51] him to Horeb and when he got the hole up
[1:39:53] God was bringing him back to his
[1:39:56] commission they lied to us
[1:40:00] now at the place completely human
[1:40:02] weaknesses exposed he could do no more
[1:40:07] but that's where God steps
[1:40:10] he's coming off that mountain refreshed
[1:40:12] like a 16 year old person think about it
[1:40:16] when we correctly stand on the word it
[1:40:19] brings us to the end of us it brings us
[1:40:25] to the end of us it takes the word
[1:40:28] coming in our lives to lead us to a
[1:40:31] complete birth and then after the new
[1:40:32] birth onto a place of full maturity
[1:40:37] Elijah wasn't seeing results he couldn't
[1:40:41] see him he couldn't feel him but it
[1:40:45] didn't mean the message wasn't having an
[1:40:47] effect it's not a public show you see
[1:40:53] God was bringing Elijah to this that you
[1:40:56] stood from my word my word has had an
[1:41:01] effect he's got to help him now this is
[1:41:05] what brother Graham wouldn't mention it
[1:41:06] just like this to us can I have just a
[1:41:08] few more moments but LaRon wouldn't
[1:41:10] mention I like this in perfect strength
[1:41:12] he said now he said it'll never do us
[1:41:14] any good it'll never it will never be
[1:41:18] until every person that professes to be
[1:41:20] a Christian will forget his own ability
[1:41:22] and yield his self to God then God can
[1:41:26] achieve his purpose by sending not a
[1:41:29] revival brother but what he needs to do
[1:41:32] first his sin the killing so we can
[1:41:35] revive he says you've got to die before
[1:41:39] you can be born again he needs a killing
[1:41:41] of ourselves this Tabernacle needs are
[1:41:44] killing and me with it all of us we need
[1:41:49] a killing so that we can be revived in a
[1:41:52] new life a new mold a new hope a new
[1:41:55] experience we need first a day of
[1:41:58] mourning a place of yielding in the
[1:42:00] spirit place for both of em says later
[1:42:04] on down we can get to a place where we
[1:42:05] can surrender our souls and lives even
[1:42:07] to the house wife to the farmer to the
[1:42:09] mechanic whoever we are we got to
[1:42:11] surrender completely to God and know
[1:42:13] that we are nothing and then let God
[1:42:16] start from there he'll starts moving and
[1:42:18] working and that includes all of us
[1:42:20] everyone that's the thing we got
[1:42:22] do God let Abraham his stream of life
[1:42:29] die up because they live because Abraham
[1:42:34] he fathered an Ishmael God let his
[1:42:39] stream of life dry up God is putting him
[1:42:46] into a condition to where it will take
[1:42:50] God to move on the scene this is where
[1:42:53] Elijah's at this is where Elijah is that
[1:42:57] and this is where when we are dealing
[1:43:01] with discouragement this is where we are
[1:43:07] rythm says he goes on and says we need
[1:43:09] to be cut down and boiled over God have
[1:43:13] mercy on me God take me and mould me God
[1:43:17] take me it's all about all about me and
[1:43:20] there's much that's no good God cut it
[1:43:22] off as my prayer this morning circumcise
[1:43:24] my heart and ears my being make me Lord
[1:43:27] make me something whatever he wants me
[1:43:29] to be
[1:43:30] is that your prayer so you see what the
[1:43:34] real enemy is this discouragement things
[1:43:39] happen and Elijah can't see what's going
[1:43:42] on he don't realize and God has to tell
[1:43:45] him after God causes Elijah in the very
[1:43:48] next scripture he tells him Elijah okay
[1:43:51] come on I want you to go verse fifteen
[1:43:54] return on that way resume to the
[1:44:01] wilderness of Damascus and when thou
[1:44:03] comest anoint Hazael to be king over
[1:44:05] Syria and jehu the son of nimshi shall
[1:44:08] tell anoint to be king over israel and
[1:44:10] elisha the son of shaphat Bema shalt
[1:44:14] thou anoint to be prophet in thy room
[1:44:18] he comes the past and whom him to escape
[1:44:20] at the sort of hazy L shall J who slay
[1:44:23] and embed escape her from the sword of
[1:44:24] Jehu sound Elijah slay yet I have left
[1:44:28] me seven thousand in Israel I imagine
[1:44:35] Elijah's heart dropped when he seen that
[1:44:39] preview seventh there she comes again
[1:44:44] marching onward Christian sold seven
[1:44:46] thousand the message it will produce it
[1:44:52] is having an effect he didn't feel it
[1:44:55] was that's what he was discouraged he
[1:44:58] was so zealous and so sailed but he had
[1:45:02] to be remoted God didn't need to remove
[1:45:06] the word he needed to remote hi-jon
[1:45:12] bring him to a place to where he can
[1:45:15] minister to him victory over his
[1:45:19] discouragement that's the same way God
[1:45:23] does you and I we can either choose to
[1:45:27] take other refuges we can choose to take
[1:45:31] other means but remember those means
[1:45:34] it's just like pills whether it's ten
[1:45:37] hours five hours 12 hours or 24 hours
[1:45:40] it'll be again but there is a place when
[1:45:45] you're discouraged God will refresh you
[1:45:49] and bring you to Mount Horeb but you've
[1:45:54] got to go to Mount Horeb you've got to
[1:45:57] be determined to get to Mount Horeb and
[1:45:59] then God can help you go and return on
[1:46:06] your way
[1:46:08] you might be sending you this morning
[1:46:10] and you might think right now maybe
[1:46:12] you're not even you don't even find the
[1:46:13] juniper-tree right now this morning and
[1:46:16] I'm telling you God's got a juniper tree
[1:46:17] for you
[1:46:18] you didn't sports it is in politics
[1:46:21] God's got a real juniper tree for you
[1:46:25] it's the very tree of life himself the
[1:46:27] Lord Jesus Christ amen it's got it's got
[1:46:30] branches it's got leaves upon it it's
[1:46:33] able to refresh you bring you shade
[1:46:36] protection and what you have mean all
[1:46:38] you got to do is make it underneath this
[1:46:40] juniper tree and when you're coming
[1:46:42] underneath that juniper Theresa and Lord
[1:46:44] refresh me Oh God maybe your soul is so
[1:46:48] vexed with sin there's no peace at all
[1:46:51] but you say if I could just get to that
[1:46:53] tree if I can get to that place to where
[1:46:57] I can have that refreshment that
[1:47:01] strength within my life I can get to
[1:47:06] Mount Horeb god knows where you're at
[1:47:09] this morning a lot of things no doubt in
[1:47:12] your life have been went the way you
[1:47:15] wanted them to go maybe some things
[1:47:17] that's happened that's literally blew
[1:47:18] your world apart but remember
[1:47:22] he knows all about your need
[1:47:29] God could have preached on Elijah he
[1:47:32] could have tore him up one side and down
[1:47:34] the other that ain't what he needed
[1:47:35] right here you with me
[1:47:38] he needs encouragement he needs
[1:47:43] encouragement no wonder Paul would
[1:47:45] admonish us his father's father's
[1:47:48] discouraged not your children unless
[1:47:50] they be angry there's a certain amount a
[1:47:55] certain place a certain point we come to
[1:47:58] so that guidance and leadership can
[1:48:01] still go forward I'm glad that he knows
[1:48:05] the balance aren't you I'll tell you
[1:48:07] this morning no matter what it is that
[1:48:09] you where you're at let him be your
[1:48:11] juniper tree and if you've received
[1:48:15] strength and nourishment
[1:48:16] maybe you're right now on day 27 of your
[1:48:18] strength and nourishment just check your
[1:48:21] compass make sure you're going to Horeb
[1:48:25] make sure you're going to Horeb
[1:48:27] make sure you're not just running on
[1:48:30] strength and then all of a sudden here
[1:48:32] once again once again let Simon are you
[1:48:36] saying if I get the Horeb I'll never be
[1:48:37] discouraged no I'm just saying that'll
[1:48:39] be one area of your life that you've got
[1:48:40] victory you might find the juniper tree
[1:48:43] again but it won't be for that same
[1:48:45] thing are you with me I believe God's
[1:48:50] interested in every heart this morning I
[1:48:52] believe he's interested in you I believe
[1:48:54] he's interested in me
[1:48:56] let's pray Lord Jesus Lord my trust is
[1:49:03] in you Lord this morning that God that
[1:49:09] you could take such a simple thought
[1:49:11] Lord things you begin to Lord just just
[1:49:14] inspiring or through the week but why
[1:49:16] mine just never Lord saw it coming Ord

[1:49:21] morning but you know our needs Lord what
[1:49:26] I couldn't yesterday I couldn't get away
[1:49:28] from it Lord they came so great in
[1:49:31] prayer that I had to set everything else
[1:49:32] aside and move right into this channel
[1:49:36] Lord father I thank you
[1:49:40] I think your Lord you know yesterday I
[1:49:43] told you thank you because the Lord even
[1:49:46] and myself as I studied it I cried I
[1:49:52] cried and in a bit of times the Lord I
[1:49:56] would I would shout thank you lord I
[1:50:02] could see myself Lord right here in
[1:50:06] these scriptures the believers the Lord
[1:50:10] I'm speaking to this morning they can
[1:50:11] see themselves right here in these
[1:50:13] scriptures to know that you are mindful
[1:50:17] that you don't come by away and say come
[1:50:22] on get up
[1:50:24] what are you down about you don't have
[1:50:28] nothing to be down about you ought to be

[1:50:32] times for that there's times for that
[1:50:38] and I'm so glad that there's a time for
[1:50:45] everything
[1:50:46] there's a time to laugh there's a time
[1:50:49] to cry there's a time for all of these
[1:50:53] things lord help us
[1:50:57] within marriages husbands and wives help
[1:51:01] us Lord to be sensitive one to another
[1:51:03] helpless as as a family as a church and
[1:51:07] help us to be sensitive Lord to the
[1:51:10] needs of one another sometimes the Lord
[1:51:13] people don't need paragraphs and
[1:51:16] everything else they already know it
[1:51:18] what they need is somebody will show a
[1:51:20] little bit of care
[1:51:23] before you could ever speak to Elijah
[1:51:26] right here in the word this is a pattern
[1:51:28] how many times your prophet would visit
[1:51:31] this from the earlier parts of his
[1:51:33] message all the way clear up to the
[1:51:36] closing messages in 1965 on this juniper
[1:51:40] tree
[1:51:44] [Music]
[1:51:45] my lord you show us just how you
[1:51:49] minister to Elijah you show us the Lord
[1:51:51] how to minister you show me as a pastor
[1:51:53] I thank you for that Lord lord knows
[1:51:58] I've made many mistakes but how I thank
[1:52:02] you Lord God for teaching me correcting
[1:52:05] me and helping me to see this sometimes
[1:52:10] the Lord where I beat myself up or what
[1:52:12] I've said god I want to help this person
[1:52:15] or these individuals Lord how do I get
[1:52:19] to them but then the Lord when I see
[1:52:26] this right here I realize oh yeah that's
[1:52:31] a truth and then Lord God as you took me
[1:52:35] down through times sometimes the Lord
[1:52:38] it's been some time pass it isn't me as
[1:52:42] a man but father you place the gift in
[1:52:45] my life as a pastor that you'll come
[1:52:48] down Lord God and you'll take that gift
[1:52:51] I'm not just a preacher I'm a pastor
[1:52:54] from my heart my heart for your people
[1:52:58] specifically for this people right here
[1:53:00] ort
[1:53:03] I'm glad Lord that you show us but
[1:53:06] sometimes people just need nourishment
[1:53:11] encouragement to rise and eat
[1:53:14] encouragement to rise
[1:53:18] then once they get to a place they get
[1:53:22] to Mount Horeb then the word of the Lord
[1:53:25] can come or Jesus this meant so much to
[1:53:33] me but I know this wasn't just for me
[1:53:36] this morning this was for us saluted it
[1:53:42] was for us as your children father the
[1:53:46] needs or God that are throughout this
[1:53:48] assembly this world
[1:53:51] I pray that God may each and every one
[1:53:56] take may we take what you've said here
[1:54:01] and gain victory over our discouragement
[1:54:08] will never Lord encouragement that we
[1:54:11] get from err anything other than the
[1:54:13] Word of God he will last but the
[1:54:16] encouragement that we'll get from the
[1:54:17] word it should lead us to Mount Horeb
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:22] where we can be remote in our thinking
[1:54:25] sometimes Lord it's not the word the
[1:54:28] word is never the problem it's our
[1:54:30] thinking our molding your prophet and
[1:54:34] Lord on the opening quotes I just read
[1:54:35] he asked you take me with the
[1:54:39] congregation and remote me remould me
[1:54:45] Lord Lord here in your presence hearts
[1:54:52] Lord God that would be honest before you
[1:54:55] say lord help me lead me Lord God if I
[1:55:01] need to be remoted or recast the way I'm
[1:55:05] looking at something to help me Lord if
[1:55:07] I've developed a complex about something
[1:55:09] a way of thinking that molding Lord
[1:55:10] helped me Lord help me God
[1:55:13] to be remoulded Lord because it's not
[1:55:15] your word that's the problem
[1:55:16] your word is right on track
[1:55:19] but let my seal and my jealousy for you
[1:55:22] Lord let it be lined with your heart
[1:55:26] Lord because in the results that I would
[1:55:32] say oh I don't see any results Elijah
[1:55:34] left Mount Carmel
[1:55:36] oh what a mighty visitation you gave him
[1:55:43] the word what to do there he didn't go
[1:55:45] on his own account
[1:55:47] it was my vision he went there he obeyed
[1:55:51] your word every step of the way and yet
[1:55:54] Lord he's looking at all of the
[1:55:55] accusations what people are saying about
[1:55:58] him he's an outcast all these things
[1:56:00] that are spoken and then on top of it
[1:56:03] churches have put him out don't want
[1:56:06] nothing to do with him that Jezebel's
[1:56:10] feared that first lady the land she says
[1:56:12] I'm gonna kill you if I find you he
[1:56:16] doesn't look like there's any fruit
[1:56:18] that's come out of it
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:24] but all I think how your prophet said it
[1:56:28] Lord he said what Elijah didn't see is
[1:56:33] what took place on Mount Carmel that day
[1:56:35] it gave courage to the 7000 to step out
[1:56:41] Oh God sometimes things that we can't
[1:56:46] see
[1:56:49] sometimes the order we get tunnel vision
[1:56:52] we need a renewing of our vision we need
[1:56:58] Lord help to get out of that tunnel
[1:56:59] vision help us the Lord we don't want
[1:57:04] that old only even I only I know Lord
[1:57:08] not there that's a sign right there
[1:57:10] our cor jealousy we need to get this on
[1:57:13] the right line the right way help us
[1:57:16] help us each and every one lord I pray
[1:57:19] that you Lord God moved for every heart
[1:57:21] there this morning
[1:57:22] father hearts and lives that Lord where
[1:57:24] there's lives that really need to know
[1:57:26] you in a real deep personal way Lord
[1:57:28] they need Lord God to really come to the
[1:57:31] Tree of Life that great juniper tree
[1:57:33] Lord and experience that real redemption
[1:57:36] of their soul Lord where it's not a
[1:57:38] church life it's not belonging to a
[1:57:41] church because that won't save them Lord
[1:57:43] they could come to this church faithful
[1:57:45] and be lost and go to hell because it's
[1:57:47] not a church that save them
[1:57:49] it's the precious blood of the Lamb and
[1:57:51] it takes that blood being applied to
[1:57:54] their soul that will literally change
[1:57:56] their nature and their life and Lord to
[1:57:58] where that it becomes a fire a fire of
[1:58:02] God on the inside of their life
[1:58:03] a strength granite Lord may they find
[1:58:09] refuge in you Lord

[2:00:35] sweet
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:43] those of you that's passed into that
[2:00:45] rest with God can't you just let it be a
[2:00:48] testimony in in a real place it's
[2:00:50] wonderful it doesn't matter what you
[2:00:53] have what you don't have your ambitions
[2:00:56] your outlook all your focus is just him
[2:01:01] Lord nothing else matters
[2:01:03] but you because you know it's like this
[2:01:07] you can work and work and work and work
[2:01:09] for something that you value but just
[2:01:14] take a walk through Jaime's flea market
[2:01:16] you'll find things out there that people
[2:01:19] work for maybe pinch pennies for maybe
[2:01:22] saved for and now it's out there for
[2:01:26] sale or you don't even have to go there
[2:01:28] just wait to bulk trash pickup day
[2:01:30] you'll find things that people have set
[2:01:33] and beside the curve that maybe they
[2:01:35] allowance they they cut back and they
[2:01:37] said you know we're all they're gonna
[2:01:39] have maybe so much chicken today and so
[2:01:41] much this and because we want this
[2:01:43] sulfur and then you see where it's at
[2:01:46] its temporal the same are you saying we
[2:01:50] shouldn't have that's not what I'm
[2:01:51] saying
[2:01:52] I'm saying that in all of those things
[2:01:55] you can do everything and think once I
[2:01:57] get this once I have this this will send
[2:02:00] nothing satisfies nothing outside of the
[2:02:05] Lord Jesus Christ nothing satisfies
[2:02:09] everything else is like a dangling
[2:02:11] carrot and it's not God dangling carrots
[2:02:13] it's the enemy but we're not to follow
