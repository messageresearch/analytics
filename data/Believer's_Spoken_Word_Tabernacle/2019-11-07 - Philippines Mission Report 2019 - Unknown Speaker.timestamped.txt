[30:11] I can't hear me I need I know nobody had
[30:19] my microphone so these things up here
[30:22] are not for looks we didn't we need to
[30:25] use them so we need to get me something
[30:27] here in these monitors it's good to be
[30:32] back I just we just had such a wonderful
[30:43] time in the way I don't want to delay at
[30:45] all I want to go ride it and get right
[30:47] into some of the testimonies here
[30:50] tonight but if we could let's open our
[30:52] Bibles and go right to the Acts of the
[30:57] 14th chapter I have it up here also on
[30:59] the screen should give me VGA 1 VGA one
[31:03] place
[31:08] and I want to go right to here on the
[31:11] screen in acts 14 and 19 through 21 the
[31:18] Bible says and there came thither
[31:20] certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium
[31:23] who persuaded the people and having
[31:26] stone Paul drew him out of the city
[31:29] supposing he had been dead howbeit as
[31:32] the disciple stood round about him he
[31:34] rose up and came into the city and the
[31:37] next day he departed with Barnabas to
[31:39] Derby and when they had preached the
[31:42] gospel to that City and had taught many
[31:45] they returned again to Lystra and to
[31:47] Iconium and Antioch confirming I want
[31:51] you to watch what they did confirming
[31:53] the souls of the disciples and exhorting
[31:56] them to continue in the faith and that
[31:59] we must through much tribulation enter
[32:02] into the kingdom of God and when they
[32:05] had ordained them elders in every city
[32:07] and had prayed with fasting they
[32:09] commended them to the Lord on whom they
[32:12] believed and and after they had passed
[32:16] through Cydia they came to Pamphylia and
[32:19] when they had preached the word in purga
[32:22] they went down to italia and they and
[32:25] they sent sail to Antioch from whence
[32:28] they had read had been recommended to
[32:30] the grace of God for the work which they
[32:33] had fulfilled and and when they were
[32:35] come and had gathered the church
[32:37] together they rehearsed all that God had
[32:42] done with them and how he had opened the
[32:46] door of faith unto the Gentiles and I
[32:50] want you just to notice that in verse 27
[32:52] we can read that again and when they
[32:54] were come and had gathered the church
[32:57] together they rehearsed all that God had
[33:02] done with them it's nothing that we have
[33:06] done of our own accord we are as just
[33:10] simply tools in God's hands and so this
[33:15] is what Paul this is what this is what
[33:17] they are exhorting to the
[33:18] to the church that they've called
[33:20] together they rehearse all that God had
[33:22] done with them and how he had opened the
[33:24] door faith unto the Gentiles and there
[33:27] they abode long time with the disciples
[33:30] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[33:33] of the word as you're being seated I'm
[33:37] sorry I forgot to put that slide next
[33:38] and you were just looking up there sorry
[33:41] about that
[33:42] sometimes it just takes me getting used
[33:44] to this and I've had to rotate it back
[33:46] and forth on this trip I want to just
[33:50] just look at a few things here because
[33:53] that's what I really feel this scripture
[33:56] was very it stood out to me about a
[33:58] month a month or so or two before we
[34:01] ever made our journey to the Philippines
[34:02] and I just loved that scripture in verse
[34:05] 27 that when they had called the church
[34:08] together and truly the Church of the
[34:10] Living God we realized it's not it's not
[34:13] a building it's more it's more than a
[34:15] building because we realized that there
[34:19] what you and I have here and are able to
[34:22] come together and we have a place that's
[34:24] called a church building but yet it
[34:27] wasn't until 300 years later after the
[34:30] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[34:32] and Pentecost where they actually had a
[34:34] church building they met in public
[34:36] houses and places like that so we
[34:39] realized that the church it was
[34:40] gathering together the believers and to
[34:43] think that what makes a believer a
[34:46] believer because they believe and and
[34:49] recognize that they the the very
[34:52] presence of the Living God personally
[34:55] with with our lives and it does
[34:57] something within our hearts when we hear
[35:00] testimonies of God's working there's
[35:04] ways that God will work through
[35:07] testimonies and as myrrh though our
[35:10] situation some of the details sometimes
[35:12] might be a little different but God is
[35:15] still the same God it's the same way
[35:17] with every experience there's not one
[35:19] experience that is exactly the same as
[35:22] far as the journey but as far as the
[35:24] experience of passing from death unto
[35:26] life that is the same but so we look at
[35:29] it into our hearts and our desire
[35:32] as believers is always to see the Lord
[35:35] Jesus Christ to see him glorified among
[35:38] his people and so when I look at this I
[35:41] think of the general orders that are
[35:43] given that still applied to us today as
[35:46] the Church of the Living God where Jesus
[35:49] said go you into the world and preach
[35:52] the gospel to every creature he that
[35:55] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[35:58] but he that believeth not shall be
[36:01] damned and I if I could be very clear he
[36:04] never said go and play the gospel jesus
[36:08] never intended here that there's to be
[36:10] tape recorders sent out and then we
[36:12] substitute the preaching but the
[36:15] preaching of the gospel is what is still
[36:17] the the God's Way in delivering the word
[36:22] to his people we thank God for the
[36:25] message we thank God for the tapes and I
[36:28] believe that when we really have a real
[36:30] understanding of it and to recognize
[36:32] that it it's not it's not something
[36:35] different if it is it's outside of the
[36:37] scriptures but it's the continuity of
[36:39] the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day
[36:42] of Pentecost and the way that he worked
[36:44] there and has worked out through the
[36:46] ages he's still working the same way
[36:48] tonight so it's the general orders that
[36:52] are given to the Church of the Living
[36:54] God and here's here's the verse 17 and
[36:56] these signs shall follow them that
[36:59] believe in my name they shall cast out
[37:02] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[37:04] they shall take up serpents and if they
[37:07] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[37:10] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[37:12] and they shall recover so then after the
[37:16] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[37:18] received up into heaven and sat on the
[37:21] right hand of God and they went forth
[37:23] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[37:26] with them and confirming the word with
[37:30] signs following this is one scripture
[37:34] that has so stood out to me when I was
[37:37] just just texting my wife just in
[37:40] regards to the the events that were
[37:43] transpiring in
[37:45] in the end the trip here to the
[37:47] Philippines I said this is this is
[37:50] exactly what I can just say is the Lord
[37:53] is present working with us confirming
[37:57] his word and we just we just seen
[37:59] confirmation after confirmation and
[38:01] God's working and I will just share some
[38:04] of those things tonight I want to just
[38:06] look at this scripture as well because I
[38:09] when I tie this in for a mission report
[38:12] I just don't want it to be of pictures
[38:14] but there's a there's a thought within
[38:16] it as well and we remember when the Lord
[38:19] Jesus is speaking of the coming of the
[38:21] Holy Spirit which remember that the the
[38:25] coming of the Holy Ghost to the believer
[38:28] was the reality that Jesus Christ
[38:31] himself had now been seated on the right
[38:34] hand of God so now all what he had
[38:37] declared all power in heaven and earth
[38:40] is given unto me now here it comes to be
[38:44] witnessed personally to the believer
[38:46] that the word that's been spoken is now
[38:49] comfort abiding in their hearts they
[38:52] walked with him upon the earth they were
[38:54] with him wherever he went they fellas
[38:57] shipped with him but now the very same
[39:00] one that they had fellowship with the
[39:02] very same one whom when John would say
[39:04] our hands have handled the word of life
[39:07] now that same God that had come down and
[39:10] dwelled among them that same God was now
[39:13] living on the inside of them and this is
[39:16] the promise where Jesus said when the
[39:19] Spirit of Truth has come in verse 13 he
[39:21] will guide you into all truth for he
[39:24] shall not speak of himself but
[39:26] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[39:29] speak and he will show you things to
[39:31] come he shall glorify me very clear
[39:38] anything that takes away from the deity
[39:41] of Jesus Christ and from Jesus Christ
[39:44] being preeminent and from him being
[39:46] seated on the right hand of God is not
[39:48] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is still
[39:52] glorifying the atoning work of the Lamb
[39:57] God and that glorification is that he is
[40:00] the same God in every way in every
[40:04] characteristic his nature has never
[40:06] changed and the greatest place for God
[40:09] to glorify this working is in the hearts
[40:13] and lives of his people where it
[40:16] manifests through our lives that indeed
[40:19] the victory and the answer of what all
[40:22] has been longing for has come into the
[40:26] heart of the believer and that the
[40:28] victory of Calvary and the resurrection
[40:30] is manifested through the life of the
[40:33] believer that he indeed has triumph over
[40:37] every principality and over every power
[40:40] and now that same life inside of us as
[40:44] believers it manifests and declares that
[40:47] indeed Jesus Christ is the Lord that's
[40:53] what the atoning work of Calvary does
[40:55] when God has done such a work and you
[40:58] can testify this in your life to where
[41:01] that the Holy Spirit takes alive and he
[41:04] begins to take a hold of that life and
[41:06] God will touch that life and even when
[41:10] God touches it sometimes he's not filled
[41:12] it all the way but he'll touch that life
[41:15] to let them know that I am alive and
[41:18] well because you cannot receive anything
[41:22] that you don't first believe in you
[41:27] don't go to a doctor and wonder if
[41:29] they're a doctor you go there you go
[41:32] there and here they are in the building
[41:34] and you believe when I go there they're
[41:37] gonna be able to help me and that's why
[41:38] you tell them Oh doctor I've got a pain
[41:40] here doctor I'm feeling like this here
[41:42] doctor I'm here you don't you don't go
[41:44] to the doctor and say are you able to
[41:46] help me you go they're already seen as a
[41:49] measure of faith and that's the same
[41:52] thing that when we approach and how God
[41:55] will touch a life and the whole thing
[41:57] got dealing with the life sometimes it's
[41:59] the genuine Holy Ghost
[42:01] the Living God with the purpose that God
[42:04] Himself who
[42:06] fully come into that individual and when
[42:09] God comes fully into a life that life
[42:12] will glorify Jesus Christ he becomes the
[42:16] center of that life through and through
[42:19] every decision then centers around Jesus
[42:24] Christ it's a real evident key of being
[42:28] filled with the Holy Ghost he shall
[42:31] glorify me see even when the Holy Ghost
[42:36] has come and something is wrong and here
[42:38] were convicted we repent why do we
[42:41] repent because the Holy Ghost inside of
[42:44] us that life there's the desire to
[42:46] please the Lord and if there's anything
[42:48] although it may not be something out
[42:50] here it might be something in here that
[42:52] may be a motive of thought and attitude
[42:54] something deep within that isn't even
[42:57] seen out here but yet the Holy Spirit
[43:00] will bring that conviction as a son and
[43:02] daughter of God because our desire is
[43:04] that he would be glorified and that's
[43:09] why the promises as he keeps his word
[43:12] the Spirit of Truth leads us into all
[43:15] truth not just mysteries but into all
[43:18] truth in our life why we do this why we
[43:22] do that it gets down into the heart and
[43:25] the matter of motives and objectives and
[43:27] all these things so he declares himself
[43:29] to be the same as the mighty conqueror
[43:31] elect how Paul says it here when he
[43:34] speaks giving a word of witness to the
[43:38] to the people how shall we escape if we
[43:40] neglect so great a salvation which at
[43:43] the first began to be spoken by the Lord
[43:45] and was confirmed unto us by him by them
[43:49] that heard him God also bearing them
[43:52] witness both with signs and wonders and
[43:54] the divers miracles and gifts of the
[43:57] Holy Ghost according to his own will all
[44:00] of this is God confirming his presence
[44:03] coming through his word
[44:05] you believe that God when you when we
[44:10] read in the book of Acts you find how
[44:13] God worked marvelously in in different
[44:17] instances God knew exactly how to get
[44:21] his word to every heart there's there's
[44:25] miracles and there's things that were
[44:27] done and even in times to where God
[44:30] would see that those who are hindering
[44:32] were moved out of the way that the word
[44:33] could reach to this individual it just
[44:37] is something when we read the Word of
[44:38] God it's not just a book to us but we
[44:42] recognize this is God's pattern and we
[44:45] can have a faith in a rest in God know
[44:48] that God is working just like brother
[44:50] Shane when he prayed here tonight that
[44:53] even as we're praying for our loved ones
[44:54] in different ones many times we don't
[44:57] see God working we don't feel God
[45:01] working but God is working if you could
[45:07] see it or you could feel it it would not
[45:10] require faith we don't pray more
[45:13] desperately when we see God working we
[45:16] should have the same desperation in
[45:19] prayer when we don't see anything moving
[45:21] at all
[45:22] why because he promised and he cannot
[45:25] fail that's the fervent prayer of a
[45:30] righteous man Oh are there things
[45:34] sometimes that look discouraging to us
[45:36] absolutely there's things that happen
[45:38] that seem discouraging but in all things
[45:41] God cannot fail and I just think of this
[45:45] I don't want to read this whole part but
[45:48] how that Paul makes mention here in the
[45:50] book of Titus of what God had hidden
[45:52] within in himself in in the beginning
[45:57] Paul speaks of how that this hope of
[46:00] eternal life which God and verse 2
[46:02] cannot lie promised before the world
[46:04] began but half in due times manifested
[46:08] his word through preaching
[46:11] God still manifest his word through
[46:14] preaching sick are healed through the
[46:18] preaching of the world Devils are cast
[46:22] out through the preaching of the word
[46:24] sick is healed through the preaching of
[46:26] the word hallelujah the Holy Ghost is
[46:30] poured out through the preaching of the
[46:32] word because the real preaching of the
[46:36] word is the preaching of the atoning
[46:39] work of the Lamb of God and the
[46:42] ministering of that is its finished no
[46:46] matter what the situation is it's
[46:49] finished
[46:50] he's already overcome he doesn't have to
[46:56] go to Calvary once again it's already
[47:00] the Bible says while Jesus was here
[47:03] walking upon this earth before every
[47:06] went to Calvary the Bible says he bore
[47:08] our sickness the Lambourn or sickness
[47:13] before every went to Calvary not some
[47:17] not partial all sickness hey man Isaiah
[47:23] 53 makes it real to our heart by His
[47:27] stripes we were healed there right not
[47:34] just some healing because of its just
[47:36] healing of some diseases then we have to
[47:40] strike away and say he was only bruised
[47:42] for some of our iniquities but the Bible
[47:46] said he was proves for our iniquities
[47:49] the entirety of it it's the same way
[47:54] with every sickness and every disease Oh
[47:58] glory
[47:59] it always declares Jesus Christ to be
[48:02] the mighty Conqueror I just want to move
[48:05] through this scriptures here here was
[48:07] Peter once again rehearsing the working
[48:10] of the Lord among the believers remember
[48:12] when they they came into among the
[48:15] Gentiles first with Cornelius and here
[48:18] was Peter with some of the Jews that
[48:20] were with him and now they've returned
[48:22] back to Jerusalem
[48:23] and the Bible says in verse 4 that last
[48:25] verse Peter rehearsed the matter from
[48:27] the beginning and expounded it by the
[48:29] order unto them and I want you to notice
[48:32] in verse 18 of this slide it says and
[48:36] when they heard these things on the
[48:38] outpouring of the Holy Ghost when they
[48:40] heard these things they held their peace
[48:42] and glorified God saying then hath God
[48:46] also to the Gentiles granted repentance
[48:49] unto life a believer will always
[48:53] recognize Jesus Christ what because what
[48:58] he does once he'll do again and again
[49:01] and again and again and when Peter
[49:04] rehearsed it it was the same pattern
[49:07] that happened to them and they could say
[49:11] that's the same God that's the same God
[49:15] working so we look at this here when
[49:20] when brother Jerry and I arrived I
[49:21] didn't know I just I just found this
[49:23] today I didn't know what the typhoon was
[49:24] but when we came in here you know when
[49:27] anything you do for the Lord how many
[49:29] you know that that Satan's always there
[49:31] to try to disturb it now what we ran
[49:36] into we're getting ready to land here in
[49:38] in in in in Japan in Tokyo that's where
[49:41] it's supposed to land over here and in
[49:43] Tokyo well we didn't know this typhoon
[49:45] was here now they had already just had a
[49:47] typhoon and I didn't even know this
[49:49] before we got there and there's been a
[49:50] high death toll before we ever got there
[49:53] of the typhoon that had just passed a
[49:54] week before that I didn't even know that
[49:57] I'm glad I didn't know it beforehand
[49:59] say the truth I didn't really find that
[50:01] out to the day but this typhoon what
[50:03] happened is is that our plane was trying
[50:06] to come in to land there and and and it
[50:09] got to a place those of you who's been
[50:11] on a plane before it got to a place
[50:13] where the runway I could see the white
[50:15] lines out there that's how close we were
[50:17] to the ground and about that time he
[50:19] just pulled the plane and we were back
[50:21] up in the air didn't even land it and
[50:24] and I could we could fill it coming down
[50:26] and it was you know even when you wrote
[50:28] on planes and enough and he'd be stilled
[50:30] you don't like filling that and we did
[50:32] that he tried to do that two other times
[50:34] we had to fly to another place
[50:36] I think it was is it Haneda there it's
[50:40] an airport just 30 miles or 30 minutes
[50:42] away by flight we landed there but they
[50:45] didn't let us get off of that airplane
[50:46] we had to set there for three hours so
[50:49] we were already on that flight what was
[50:51] it almost 14 hours on that flight 14
[50:53] hours and then we had three hours
[50:55] setting there then they finally said
[50:57] we're gonna take you back to Tokyo and
[50:59] we're gonna try to get you off of there
[51:00] and so forth when we got back we had
[51:02] missed our flight so when we got there
[51:08] you know they said we're gonna have
[51:10] everything taken care of and so forth we
[51:13] got there I'm gonna come up on my phone
[51:14] on my on my Delta app is your next
[51:18] flight is Sunday morning at 9:30
[51:20] I said that's unacceptable that's
[51:25] unacceptable and you know it had nothing
[51:28] to do with about staying overnight in
[51:31] Tokyo there weren't one thing brother
[51:35] Jerry can testify to this that he and I
[51:37] we never talked about we're gonna have
[51:40] to sleep in the airport tonight because
[51:41] they already told us that because of
[51:43] this this typhoon that water was just
[51:47] the buses and everything else had shut
[51:49] down in Tokyo and all the hotels were
[51:52] filled and people weren't going anywhere
[51:54] so you know with in at all that was not
[51:58] even the thought but the thought was
[51:59] we've got an appointment on Sunday
[52:02] morning he's gonna have to preach
[52:04] somewhere and I've got to preach
[52:06] somewhere this is not acceptable now
[52:09] that's where all my urgency became and
[52:11] upon us working and you know through the
[52:13] praying you know brother Jerry was doing
[52:15] the praying
[52:18] and I was doing the action
[52:21] I was the action behind the string you
[52:25] know the Lord you know we sit there and
[52:28] I sit there and God provided where I
[52:31] could get a delta rep on the phone
[52:32] because nobody there was helping us in
[52:34] the right way you know and III they were
[52:37] able to arrange a flight and everything
[52:39] and get us so that the next day we would
[52:41] be able to fly out of Tokyo in the
[52:44] morning flower to Shanghai and then from
[52:46] Shanghai we could fly down into Manila
[52:48] and get there on Saturday evening so we
[52:51] could be there for Sunday so I really
[52:52] thank God for making that available but
[52:54] this was the thing about it now I didn't
[53:01] get this air mattress that's a cardboard
[53:03] box that was my tempur-pedic mattress
[53:06] right there when I didn't get that till
[53:09] 3:00 a.m. now no you can't see you see
[53:11] brother Jerry's feet right here brother
[53:13] Jerry got one seat because everybody
[53:16] else was already everybody else's
[53:17] flights were so you had people you know
[53:20] that we're just taking up three and four
[53:23] seats and laying down you know they were
[53:24] just thinking about themselves and so
[53:28] brother Jerry is sitting there you know
[53:30] in the chair and there was and and I was
[53:32] down there I just had late on that low
[53:34] Liam floor I didn't even have that
[53:36] sleeping bag I just made my my backpack
[53:38] my pillow and you know yours on and off
[53:41] snoozing but finally at any rate thank
[53:44] God that God had kept us through that
[53:47] night and so we just we thank God for
[53:50] that that was a little bit of a brother
[53:52] Jerry said of the times I've been here
[53:53] he said I've never experienced going
[53:56] through this you know and that's the
[53:59] first time I think I had stayed over in
[54:00] an airport but but the Lord was was
[54:04] mindful and and helped us through it so
[54:08] here we come on Sunday morning and
[54:11] brother Jerry preached at brother Roel
[54:14] Soriano's he preached there on the
[54:17] Sunday morning and I was to preach at
[54:19] brother ray Soriano's brother Rho elz
[54:21] brother at elect bride assembly so I
[54:24] don't have any pictures when brother
[54:25] Jerry didn't
[54:27] have any they're from brother oels but
[54:30] this here is his brother brother ray
[54:33] Soriano and here at his assembly and I
[54:38] included two pictures that he sent me
[54:40] because on this when we were there he
[54:42] took off on a mission trip right after
[54:45] this this time here it was a day later
[54:48] he took off into I think it's called be
[54:51] cool be cool he took off and he bad they
[54:53] baptized 16 souls so they went right on
[54:56] a mission trip right from there and he
[54:58] baptized 16 Souls so they're very much
[55:00] working in in in the mission work that's
[55:04] going on right there and as I was as I
[55:09] was there you know with within the
[55:11] church this brother Oh L had shared
[55:14] something and I just wanted to share
[55:15] this with you brother Oh L had shared
[55:17] something with me just very briefly he
[55:19] was talking about how that you know
[55:21] brother ray in them he said they he said
[55:23] they just you know he said they they've
[55:25] just been disappointed they they need a
[55:27] church building well when I was there I
[55:30] went into the office and I thought you
[55:33] know what i was already resting at this
[55:35] is what i'm going to preach today and as
[55:38] i'm sitting there I gave brother brother
[55:40] ray my title and then brother wrinkles
[55:43] out and gives it to them on the internet
[55:44] and he comes back in a few minutes
[55:46] before I'm going to walk out and I said
[55:47] dude you mind I said we're gonna have to
[55:50] change that title I said because I've
[55:52] had a change here and the Lord just
[55:54] dropped in my heart just a scripture and
[55:57] we just preached from that scripture
[55:58] delight thyself in the Lord and he shall
[56:00] give me the desires of that word and we
[56:03] just just just preached it just just
[56:05] some things that the Lord brought
[56:06] together and just going through the
[56:08] scriptures with it and and and I had no
[56:12] idea
[56:12] you know brother Ola had just mentioned
[56:14] just you know just talking just
[56:16] mentioned very briefly but I had no idea
[56:17] the details but when I came out of there
[56:20] and I'm having to step over over people
[56:23] to even get in there to to the pulpit
[56:27] and there's like 300 some people there
[56:29] and they and as I'm ministering the word
[56:31] of the Lord it just things just start
[56:33] coming out and strikes me and I just
[56:34] said you need a
[56:36] they're building you need another place
[56:40] God's gonna give you another place and
[56:43] we begin to just just how the Holy
[56:46] Spirit was take it then I began to
[56:47] didn't examples begin to come to me of
[56:50] how God brought us to this point as an
[56:53] assembly there were things that begin to
[56:54] come out that I had never even thought
[56:56] of or put together and the long story
[57:00] short when I come out of it and coming
[57:02] out of this service
[57:03] one thing that they that the church and
[57:06] I put this in there just from the book
[57:08] of Acts and I'm going to read it but the
[57:10] Bible talks about how that the church
[57:12] itself was edified and I can tell you
[57:15] right now I had no idea of the things
[57:17] that they had went through with this
[57:19] property or this or that I had no idea
[57:21] about that but God did and God knew
[57:24] exactly what they had need of and it
[57:26] went on beyond just that of a church
[57:28] building and things in that nature but
[57:30] God knew exactly what those people had
[57:34] need of and God I tell you how mindful
[57:37] God is God was so mindful of the needs
[57:39] of the people that God he would allow me
[57:42] to think I'm going to preach something
[57:44] and then I get a few minutes from
[57:45] walking out and then I'm just writing
[57:47] down scriptures to walk out and preach
[57:49] those scriptures and bring that God
[57:52] knows what he's doing the people
[57:54] afterwards you know here we are I'm
[57:56] sitting with the Brethren they're there
[57:59] you know they they have a little place
[58:00] off in the second floor and I'm there
[58:03] with the Brethren and we were just
[58:05] fellowshipping and the Brethren were so
[58:07] the church different ones kept saying
[58:09] brother you'd have no idea today of the
[58:12] things that were were ministered and
[58:14] were spoken God knows that we needed
[58:16] that encouragement and you know the
[58:20] whole focus that they caught out of it
[58:22] because they hadn't pulled back from
[58:24] from from doing the work of the Lord but
[58:27] the whole focus came in is that whatever
[58:29] desire that you have first of all
[58:32] delight yourself in the Lord and He will
[58:34] give you the desires of your heart
[58:37] that's first delight myself in the Lord
[58:39] then ever God will make everything else
[58:41] go bring everything else in order and
[58:43] they really just the Holy Spirit just
[58:45] took that and
[58:47] and brought that you know among among
[58:48] the people right after this we came
[58:51] brother Jerry and I we had Monday Monday
[58:54] we had we had off and we could kind of
[58:58] trying to reclaim some rests from what
[59:01] we missed on the trip and then we
[59:04] started in on Tuesday we had to make the
[59:06] trip to tag a tie which is about well I
[59:12] don't know exactly how many miles or
[59:14] kilometers it's when you talk in the
[59:16] terms of the Philippines of traveling
[59:18] you never talk in terms of kilometers or
[59:20] miles you're talking how long it's going
[59:23] to take you because they're naturally to
[59:26] get here I would say probably from
[59:28] Manila to Taggart I where we had to go
[59:30] it would might be the distance I don't
[59:33] even know if I'd save the distance from
[59:34] here to Sandusky I think that'd be too
[59:35] far but it took every bit I think of
[59:39] three hours for us to get there little
[59:41] more than three hours so we're up early
[59:44] on Tuesday brother Boyd when the deccan
[59:46] we he's been brother Jerry and I there
[59:48] so that when we get there then we're
[59:50] ready to step in on Tuesday they've
[59:52] already started getting a retreat
[59:54] together and let me just just move on
[59:58] here
[59:59] you find this here taggi tie is is like
[1:00:03] a it's like a tourist place a very very
[1:00:06] beautiful place right here brother Jerry
[1:00:08] brother Roy and myself larache taking a
[1:00:11] picture right here in front of a volcano
[1:00:13] this whole this whole Lake is actually a
[1:00:15] big crater but that's an active volcano
[1:00:18] right there it was actually as I had a
[1:00:20] little bit of smoke coming out of it
[1:00:21] when we were there but I mean when I say
[1:00:25] active it happened I think it been a
[1:00:27] hundred years but they kept talking
[1:00:28] about there was smoke and things coming
[1:00:30] out of this so it was this place to me
[1:00:34] was just it was beautiful
[1:00:36] and this is kind of a little thing but
[1:00:38] right along these areas right here where
[1:00:40] we're standing right here they have
[1:00:43] places like this Starbucks you can sit
[1:00:46] down and you could look out there tap
[1:00:48] volcano
[1:00:49] they have Starbucks there that you know
[1:00:52] that they're bigger than Bob Evans here
[1:00:54] they're the size of them and things you
[1:00:57] know and they love coffee over there
[1:00:59] they love coffee you know but they did
[1:01:02] this is a it's a real beautiful area a
[1:01:05] tagging time very beautiful area and
[1:01:07] that's where they had the youth retreat
[1:01:09] at and you can just see just some of the
[1:01:12] pictures of places like a very much of a
[1:01:15] resort area here is the the retreat and
[1:01:20] the training center that there were they
[1:01:22] held held the retreat and we're arriving
[1:01:26] there there's brother LL and sister Chi
[1:01:30] Chi and brother Jerry we're getting all
[1:01:32] checked in and trying to get things
[1:01:33] established with the schedule where
[1:01:36] we're at and I just say it like this
[1:01:38] that you know a brother Jerry and I
[1:01:42] that's the second trip that we've been
[1:01:43] on together but it's been such a
[1:01:46] blessing to to be able to work with him
[1:01:50] and I don't say that because he's here
[1:01:53] and I don't say it because he's my
[1:01:54] brother I say it because it's true
[1:01:57] because it's it's nice when you come in
[1:01:59] to them it's nice when you have ministry
[1:02:02] where you can work together sometimes
[1:02:06] you'll find out say well who's preaching
[1:02:08] with me and you find out say that way
[1:02:13] you know you're all going to be pulling
[1:02:14] the same direction you know and and and
[1:02:17] brother Jerry and and and I just was
[1:02:19] just like you know we were able to just
[1:02:22] just going back and forth you know
[1:02:24] between one another brother Jerry
[1:02:27] he took the the evening services at the
[1:02:30] retreat
[1:02:32] the preaching services and how many
[1:02:36] services what was due preached to
[1:02:37] evening in one morning three services he
[1:02:40] had to preach in in those in that time
[1:02:43] the burden that that where my part was
[1:02:46] is the teaching I had to two one-hour
[1:02:49] teaching sessions each of those days
[1:02:51] ahead
[1:02:52] so the two four sessions and then they
[1:02:54] had the questions and answer session the
[1:02:56] last day so we we laid in some things
[1:03:01] you see the musicians that are there
[1:03:03] these actually are some one of them's a
[1:03:05] pastor from one of the local groups
[1:03:06] they're around taggi ty and they've they
[1:03:09] put together the music and you know set
[1:03:11] everything up for that and you see just
[1:03:15] some of the young the young people that
[1:03:17] have gathered there and this is
[1:03:21] something I don't know if this have been
[1:03:23] I think this is the one you got that on
[1:03:24] the podium one this is one of those
[1:03:27] slides that's going to kick in sir
[1:03:41] she said not yet but I said you get the
[1:03:49] Holy Ghost first and you tell me what a
[1:03:52] husband because remember it's God fries
[1:04:06] so this seeking is this this is Europe
[1:04:11] you see some of the teaching we started
[1:04:15] out the first session their only love
[1:04:18] courtship and marriage and just going
[1:04:20] through some things with them on the
[1:04:21] vows everything comes through headship
[1:04:24] as well so we were doing some teaching
[1:04:26] there with them on that and then I don't
[1:04:30] know if this is I don't think I have the
[1:04:33] one in here of you and your preaching
[1:04:35] but brother Jerry was coming right back
[1:04:37] around there young people just so
[1:04:41] responded to the word of the Lord this
[1:04:44] is the first night I believe when
[1:04:46] brother Jerry spoken brother Jerry gave
[1:04:48] his testimonies of how God where he
[1:04:54] stood you know with the the truth and
[1:04:57] and and knowing that the message was the
[1:04:59] truth but coming to see and my a part of
[1:05:03] it
[1:05:04] in my apartment and he brought he
[1:05:08] brought the testimony from being a
[1:05:10] pastor son well we didn't know but
[1:05:13] there's a lot within this gathering here
[1:05:15] there was a lot of pastors children and
[1:05:18] so after this in those of you that's
[1:05:21] been to the Ruth retreats this is very
[1:05:23] much tailored like the winter youth
[1:05:25] retreated by the poem for the Barry
[1:05:26] except there's a lot more sessions in
[1:05:30] here as far as preaching and teaching a
[1:05:32] lot more but during their morning
[1:05:34] devotions from 6:00 to 7:00 this is what
[1:05:37] they would discuss and that was one of
[1:05:39] the things that came out is this was
[1:05:42] first service even of the impact of how
[1:05:46] things were even the clarity even on the
[1:05:49] teaching that was done on the vows and
[1:05:50] the courtship and so forth and then this
[1:05:53] of how that it's so touched those as
[1:05:55] pastors children how they were touched
[1:05:58] and their hearts they were very much
[1:06:00] moved within that so we just thank God
[1:06:03] for that this another the teaching
[1:06:05] session I think this was the second day
[1:06:07] and we just just dealing with this part
[1:06:10] on the duality of person that you have
[1:06:12] the outer man you have the inner man
[1:06:14] the inner man is to be strengthened and
[1:06:16] how that you have this the constant how
[1:06:19] your walk in the Lord and how God has
[1:06:21] has placed you in this life the things
[1:06:24] that you have to
[1:06:27] tend to as far as even with your work
[1:06:30] getting your schooling and yet balancing
[1:06:32] all that that it that you have to rely
[1:06:35] not on the outer man but rely on the
[1:06:38] inner man and the way the Lord had
[1:06:40] brought that here within it I end up
[1:06:41] taking two parts on this because with
[1:06:44] many of it you a lot of these young
[1:06:46] people they go they're going to school
[1:06:48] they're getting educated so then the way
[1:06:51] that we were dealing with this part you
[1:06:52] have that part and some of the young
[1:06:54] people here they've they've they
[1:06:57] probably may recognize the slide they've
[1:06:58] heard this when they were in my basement
[1:07:00] so a lot of these things that I've
[1:07:02] taught over there everything I taught
[1:07:04] the young people here have already heard
[1:07:06] it and seen this but it was you know in
[1:07:09] in regards to where even though you
[1:07:12] might have a master's degree and your
[1:07:14] pastor may not even have a high school
[1:07:16] education your ability to receive you do
[1:07:20] not receive based on your degree you
[1:07:23] receive and you recognize God by the
[1:07:26] eyes of your heart so you never ever
[1:07:30] ever say well this person doesn't have
[1:07:32] the status I have maybe I can't receive
[1:07:34] from that no you recognize the skills
[1:07:36] God's placed within you and just like I
[1:07:38] told them as I told the young people
[1:07:40] here
[1:07:40] God does not put you in earth in this
[1:07:43] earth without skills already laying
[1:07:45] within you that you come to the
[1:07:48] realization of what he's put in you and
[1:07:50] then you have that through schooling
[1:07:52] that refines those skills so we dealt
[1:07:56] with that then here here's here we are
[1:07:58] at the banquet they had this banquet on
[1:08:00] Tuesday night remember we still have one
[1:08:01] more day left here so they had this on
[1:08:04] Tuesday night that's brother le he drove
[1:08:06] us around and sometimes the first night
[1:08:11] we got there brother brother Alwyn he
[1:08:14] picked this up at the airport
[1:08:16] I thought we were in a race yeah I told
[1:08:21] Jerry I'm sitting in the backseat and I
[1:08:24] said man I said you know what I knew his
[1:08:26] gonna get the hit Jerry says because you
[1:08:27] weren't sitting in the front seat he
[1:08:29] said I know he said we came that close
[1:08:31] to their motorbikes you know there's no
[1:08:37] such things as Road lines you just you
[1:08:39] know they take four lanes of traffic I
[1:08:41] make a claims out of it you know so here
[1:08:45] they're giving presentations here in the
[1:08:49] banquet night and they had made some
[1:08:52] presentations and you know brother Jerry
[1:08:54] got his diploma as well we're thankful
[1:08:56] he graduated now and so he you know and
[1:09:00] brother Jerry we're going through this
[1:09:01] banquet of them brother Jerry you can
[1:09:03] see they've put the podium now into the
[1:09:05] hall where we hate at and brother
[1:09:07] Jerry's gonna preach that night and
[1:09:09] brother Jerry just preached a
[1:09:10] masterpiece that night about midnight
[1:09:12] and how that you know midnight in only
[1:09:16] lasts and there's one minute the one
[1:09:18] minute that follows it there's a freedom
[1:09:20] and God just Marvis Lee moved among the
[1:09:25] young people in that night everything
[1:09:28] itself there was a building that was
[1:09:30] taking place within these services here
[1:09:33] and and this was a young lady her name
[1:09:37] is DJ and she gave a testimony and the
[1:09:42] testimony she gave was in in the meeting
[1:09:48] one of the services and I think it was
[1:09:50] it might have been this I don't know it
[1:09:52] was the first day of the second day I
[1:09:53] don't remember I think was it might have
[1:09:55] been the second day where I was teaching
[1:09:56] and just some things as I had was in the
[1:10:00] middle of teaching and we got into a
[1:10:01] spot about the tests and trials of life
[1:10:04] and how it was just something how the
[1:10:07] Holy Spirit just honed right in and I
[1:10:09] was right there right beside her and
[1:10:11] just looking right at her and talking to
[1:10:13] her and I had no idea what she had just
[1:10:17] went through
[1:10:19] but then she gave that she gives this
[1:10:22] testimony and what the testimony was is
[1:10:26] how that here she is she's listening to
[1:10:30] a message but the Brennan was speaking
[1:10:33] and she's she's come up she's you know
[1:10:35] she's having to study in Manila away
[1:10:37] from her family and and and and and
[1:10:40] she's the doctors have diagnosed her
[1:10:43] that she has all over her ovaries and
[1:10:46] things be just covered with tumors it
[1:10:50] she's just just just in a bad condition
[1:10:54] on she's listening to a message and
[1:10:57] she's just looking to the Lord and she
[1:11:00] said on that message he said brother
[1:11:01] Branham calls out the color a dress that
[1:11:04] I'm wearing and he said he calls out on
[1:11:08] there and then he called out the
[1:11:10] condition that I was just diagnosed with
[1:11:13] she said right there she said as I was
[1:11:15] listening to them message she said I
[1:11:17] knew that that was my healing so this
[1:11:22] had just taken place just you know just
[1:11:25] a some days before and in the way that
[1:11:28] this as it came down and where she began
[1:11:30] to weep is because as the Lord began to
[1:11:33] tell her that the things that God has
[1:11:35] just brought you through and what you
[1:11:37] have come through is not about you it's
[1:11:40] a testimony for his glory that you might
[1:11:43] be able to share with us I had no idea
[1:11:45] but God knew that she shared it with
[1:11:48] brother o-l afterwards and brother
[1:11:49] Rowell shared it with with with brother
[1:11:51] Jerry myself then she gave a testimony
[1:11:53] that night and so you know you just see
[1:11:58] how God just just working there here's
[1:12:00] brother Jerry preaching that night
[1:12:02] and within the service you see a little
[1:12:05] bit more of the setup there here's the
[1:12:10] questions and answers part of the youth
[1:12:13] retreat so brother J myself are going
[1:12:15] back and forth and and brother o L in
[1:12:18] answering questions and man the
[1:12:20] questions just one started and then it
[1:12:23] just one right after another but I want
[1:12:27] to make this statement you see right
[1:12:29] here brother Gerry preached a message
[1:12:32] right here and he took they took the
[1:12:36] thought at thy word Lord will launch out
[1:12:41] to the deep and I watched how God
[1:12:48] masterfully took the word and just this
[1:12:54] was the last morning this was not a
[1:12:56] night service and the reason I make that
[1:12:58] statement is because it just doesn't
[1:13:02] have to be a night service when God
[1:13:05] moves God moves when he moves
[1:13:15] brother Jerry and I he can testify to
[1:13:18] this he had the same function in his
[1:13:20] heart he and I were setting at breakfast
[1:13:23] before we ever got here this morning and
[1:13:25] we were up you know were up early
[1:13:27] setting down there and drinking our
[1:13:29] coffee and things and we had received I
[1:13:32] had received a question that was passed
[1:13:34] over to me in the banquet and every
[1:13:37] question that that that we had it was
[1:13:40] something that I thought the jury and I
[1:13:43] kind of talked about him in the room
[1:13:44] that night and I said my eyes and I just
[1:13:46] we need the wisdom of God and how to how
[1:13:49] to approach this and so we went to bed
[1:13:52] that night he didn't know that brother
[1:13:54] oh ellan them here they were brother Roy
[1:13:56] had went back to the campground there
[1:13:57] was a situation that Harry was in
[1:13:59] counseling and dealing with and then it
[1:14:01] had him up high he couldn't sleep
[1:14:03] throughout the night because it was such
[1:14:05] a need that was there and before they
[1:14:11] ever came down to breakfast it just just
[1:14:14] the witness of the Holy Ghost of my
[1:14:16] heart it just said I'm not finished here
[1:14:19] yet and then you know brother Owen them
[1:14:23] came down and they were sharing as far
[1:14:25] as you know they just did just just you
[1:14:27] know had a hard time sleeping that night
[1:14:29] so forth and brother brother Jerry and I
[1:14:30] we got back up the room and I spoke that
[1:14:32] to brother Jerry he had the same witness
[1:14:34] of the Holy Spirit as well we prayed
[1:14:36] right there in that hotel room the power
[1:14:39] of God came right down in that room when
[1:14:43] he walked there to the platform after or
[1:14:46] up here right here after we had
[1:14:48] questions and answers you see these
[1:14:50] young people and this was a picture that
[1:14:52] sister chichi took this was this was
[1:14:55] afterwards I had a deed these were some
[1:14:57] of the latter people that I was praying
[1:14:59] for there was people all through there
[1:15:00] but then the one need that was there
[1:15:04] that
[1:15:06] a lot of these things there was so many
[1:15:08] needs I didn't you just you have that
[1:15:11] feeling there's needs there's
[1:15:12] deliverances it's needed there's there
[1:15:14] is a lives to be filled with the Holy
[1:15:17] Ghost and here with brother Jerry he'd
[1:15:20] just finished at the end and it just
[1:15:22] gives that little call I'll tell you
[1:15:24] what there were young people that
[1:15:25] couldn't wait to get out of their seats
[1:15:27] and oh and one individual where the
[1:15:31] enemy had so tied them up
[1:15:33] Satan was just dismantled in that
[1:15:37] service
[1:15:38] I mean dismantled I set back there and
[1:15:43] I'm sitting back there watching him
[1:15:45] preach I said I was sitting I said Satan
[1:15:49] your kingdoms coming down it was being
[1:15:52] dismantled one right after another I
[1:15:54] tell you it was just it was awesome to
[1:15:57] behold and that life I tell you what the
[1:16:00] one that young lady I told brother Jerry
[1:16:03] we went eight after this and then we
[1:16:04] came back you know to be with the young
[1:16:07] people here we came back into that room
[1:16:09] after we got done eatin and I told
[1:16:11] brother Jerry I said that young lady I
[1:16:13] said this is the first time I said she
[1:16:15] got joy on her face you could see her
[1:16:19] she would just feel with joy how god
[1:16:22] it's so moved on the scene of course
[1:16:26] these are activities then you know with
[1:16:28] the young people and brother oil and we
[1:16:30] we got in on the activities what the
[1:16:33] young people had a good time there and
[1:16:35] then of course brother Jerry and I'm
[1:16:37] Jerry Jerry said I need to step out here
[1:16:39] for some fresh air because they got
[1:16:40] stuffy well they love photos
[1:16:46] Filipinos love photos I think they're
[1:16:49] the ones who invented selfies and I'm
[1:16:54] really being serious about that brother
[1:16:56] Rowland I was talked about but we moved
[1:16:58] from here they wanted to take pictures
[1:16:59] you know and if we move just a little
[1:17:01] bit here was another round I told your
[1:17:05] acid journey if we move any more it's a
[1:17:08] new pose let's not move let's just do
[1:17:12] what we can you know to stay here but
[1:17:17] then we come to the convention here in
[1:17:18] Manila and this is back where all the
[1:17:21] believers come together there's multiple
[1:17:23] conventions going on at this time from
[1:17:24] what I understand but in November first
[1:17:26] they have it there all the people are
[1:17:28] off because during November first from
[1:17:31] November October 31st through November
[1:17:33] first
[1:17:33] all the people travel back to their home
[1:17:36] provinces and they go out into the
[1:17:38] graveyards and in the graveyards they
[1:17:40] drink and play cards and they're having
[1:17:41] a reunion with their people who's passed
[1:17:44] on so that's a big thing so they go back
[1:17:47] to their provinces and and so here
[1:17:52] that's why they have the fellowship on
[1:17:54] November 1st because everybody's off to
[1:17:55] work it's such a it's a national holiday
[1:17:57] so you here we are that the overcomer
[1:18:00] Worship Center this is brother Royals
[1:18:01] home church and we're actually going to
[1:18:04] have it right there in that building
[1:18:06] yeah this is how it looked before we
[1:18:08] went to the youth retreat they had
[1:18:10] already brought the pews out of the
[1:18:11] church and got them out there so that
[1:18:14] then they could set them up out here
[1:18:16] this is used as a parking garage as well
[1:18:18] during a normal Sunday because they just
[1:18:20] don't have anywhere to park the cars so
[1:18:23] here they are they've got to get all
[1:18:25] this together and in order and the
[1:18:27] brothers had it in order by the time we

[1:24:20] browning here in the church as an
[1:24:22] assembly we to see that that property
[1:24:26] when that that we're preaching in right

[1:24:30] that property was was secured and they
[1:24:33] built in that the structure on it that
[1:24:36] now that they have the meetings in as
[1:24:38] well as the fellowship hall and that's
[1:24:40] what we're preaching right now is that
[1:24:41] clear okay I think I'd shared that with
[1:24:44] you before
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:40] [Applause]
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:51] that night that that that evening
[1:25:54] service we preached I just took a just a
[1:25:57] simple thought the Lord had given me
[1:25:58] that previous Sunday come back home and
[1:26:04] I just preached that on the sons of God
[1:26:05] come back home and so we just we
[1:26:08] ministered that night and right here
[1:26:11] brother Jerry and the other ministers I
[1:26:13] just had just it felt letting my heart
[1:26:15] to to make a call for lives that wanted
[1:26:19] to surrender their lives hearts that
[1:26:21] wanted to receive the Holy Ghost come
[1:26:22] fully back home and and just it just the
[1:26:28] response were we had the people right
[1:26:31] there and lives that just had responded
[1:26:33] to the word and wanted to come come back
[1:26:36] home produções coming home hearts to be
[1:26:39] filled with the Spirit of God so here we
[1:26:42] are we prayed out I don't even know how
[1:26:44] long that we we prayed there that that
[1:26:47] that evening for the different needs it
[1:26:49] just seemed like there was they were
[1:26:51] already there all across and then it
[1:26:54] just kept coming down the aisle kept
[1:26:56] coming down the aisle to be prayed for
[1:26:59] and different needs and the different
[1:27:01] brothers I wanted the ministering that
[1:27:03] we're up there and those that were out I
[1:27:05] wanted everybody the ministry to come
[1:27:07] and to help us pray to pray for those
[1:27:09] needs that were there and then the
[1:27:11] ministers just came and worked right
[1:27:13] together and
[1:27:14] many I believe many lives receive from
[1:27:18] God what they had need of I believe her
[1:27:22] many that came back home amen and so I
[1:27:27] just see them the people here were
[1:27:28] worshiping even right there afterwards
[1:27:31] let me just try to hurry here here's the
[1:27:33] young people singing they're singing
[1:27:36] special this is that brother Rho elz
[1:27:40] Jerry I'll get to where he was at on
[1:27:43] this was the last Sunday morning this
[1:27:45] one was this November 3rd so I spoke
[1:27:47] there this time that brother Rho elz
[1:27:49] on that Sunday morning and we just just
[1:27:52] took a little thought there and and just
[1:27:55] ministered just something the Lord just
[1:27:57] dropped on a heart there that morning
[1:27:58] and brother o-l after the service was
[1:28:01] over a high you know just we're just
[1:28:02] talking how the Lord had just so
[1:28:04] wonderfully moved even in this service
[1:28:06] right here and once again you don't you
[1:28:09] don't know of the needs and of questions
[1:28:12] that are present but God knows every
[1:28:15] need and brother oil just told me after
[1:28:18] the service he said you have no idea
[1:28:19] that so many questions were answered
[1:28:22] within this service so I said thanks be
[1:28:25] to God
[1:28:26] amen things be to God brother Jerry was
[1:28:30] here he was back up in Tagget I and
[1:28:33] brother adelies assembly
[1:28:37] on this Sunday morning so he was he was
[1:28:39] up there and here he is ministry here
[1:28:42] within within this church and as brother
[1:28:47] Jerry I think it was was it before you
[1:28:49] ministered they started giving the
[1:28:50] testimonies so before he ministered this
[1:28:54] was the place here where they had the
[1:28:58] one one young lady whom God had did such
[1:29:00] a marvelous work for in that youth
[1:29:02] retreat she got up and she gave the
[1:29:04] testimony in English and and and just
[1:29:10] what she had said you know brother Jerry
[1:29:12] had just dealt with something in the
[1:29:15] manner he was dealing with the fact he
[1:29:17] said there say he said clinical
[1:29:19] depression is something in here where
[1:29:21] there's no external factors causing it
[1:29:23] he said but there could be depression
[1:29:25] where there's external factors that's
[1:29:26] causing that and how the Lord took him
[1:29:29] and and and brother Jerry just simply
[1:29:31] put it he said and that's your fault
[1:29:34] you're in that depressed state and it's
[1:29:37] external factors that's your fault you
[1:29:39] can be delivered and you can walk out of
[1:29:41] that and I'll tell you that's exactly
[1:29:44] what happened with that young lady she
[1:29:48] stood up and she then gave a testimony
[1:29:50] right here in this church and she said
[1:29:53] you know what what brother Jerry said it
[1:29:55] was my fault she said that's a truth but
[1:29:59] she testified I'm free
[1:30:06] then there is a brother and they where
[1:30:08] it gets past him to microphone around
[1:30:10] and brother adeline different ones I
[1:30:12] guess what they were saying when we got
[1:30:14] together that night they couldn't figure
[1:30:16] out why this brother he had been sitting
[1:30:17] in the church almost a year I know he
[1:30:20] hadn't made a move or nothing he'd have
[1:30:22] been sitting there and he got the
[1:30:25] microphone and know he's gonna testify
[1:30:27] and they thought I mean the brother
[1:30:31] hadn't even walked in water baptism yet
[1:30:33] or anything but he got the microphone
[1:30:36] and he testified what God had did for
[1:30:40] him in the November 1 convention and he
[1:30:43] said I'm gonna be baptized that morning
[1:30:46] for the Jerry baptized he was sent in
[1:30:54] assembly a year it seemed like well
[1:30:55] nothing's going on but you know God's
[1:30:57] working God's working sometimes we need
[1:31:03] to say lord help me to be patient with
[1:31:06] you because sometimes when you look at
[1:31:10] you can look at others and remember our
[1:31:12] impatience is not with others it's with
[1:31:15] God you must remember don't ever be
[1:31:18] impatient with God sometimes it seems
[1:31:22] like he's not working but that word when
[1:31:24] it goes forth it's working it's working
[1:31:27] so here brother Jerry gathered with the
[1:31:30] brothers and brother adlai right there
[1:31:35] he was actually brother oels chief
[1:31:37] musician in the church and now he's
[1:31:40] pastoring a church there and then you
[1:31:43] know here are some pictures I mean the
[1:31:45] kids love Jerry look at him all
[1:31:48] gathering around
[1:31:50] they asked him a I mean they he was
[1:31:53] telling us how they asked him a bunch of
[1:31:55] questions and you know the effect like
[1:31:58] with them with the children I mean the
[1:32:00] young people just really just really
[1:32:02] took also you know what brother Gerry
[1:32:04] the minister and the word just so
[1:32:05] reached and touched their lives got so
[1:32:07] personal with him and here with brother
[1:32:10] Adlai his wife and his that his daughter
[1:32:13] okay that's his wife and his daughter so
[1:32:16] we certainly I think God for that then
[1:32:19] that evening I didn't have to preach to
[1:32:21] service on Sunday I was living in the
[1:32:25] new dispensation brother Gerry got
[1:32:26] transported back to the old dispensation
[1:32:28] I would live in in grace he was under
[1:32:31] law he was made to preach to service on
[1:32:35] Sunday so he preaches at another
[1:32:37] brothers church actually a a relative of
[1:32:39] brother Oh al brother Jess up aunt Aggie
[1:32:42] ty it's just a nut but it's an hour and
[1:32:43] a half apart and they called a special
[1:32:46] Sunday evening service and here and this
[1:32:50] when we got there that night we we met
[1:32:53] up with brother Jerry and we got there
[1:32:54] now this is what I remembered and
[1:32:57] sometimes when we went to Honduras and
[1:32:59] you show it for a meeting you all were
[1:33:01] as already supposed to start at that
[1:33:03] service we missed a turn but that's how
[1:33:06] it is over there you know in times when
[1:33:08] you're there what time's the service
[1:33:09] seven seven o'clock comes around what
[1:33:12] time service yeah 7:30 you realize
[1:33:18] things don't run on American time so
[1:33:22] we're over there you just you know here
[1:33:23] we are brother Ella they get the coconut
[1:33:25] juice out and they put the pie out of
[1:33:27] them thinking I'm thinking they're
[1:33:29] already singing inside here's the church
[1:33:31] there are already singing it in there
[1:33:33] and they're bringing food out in front
[1:33:34] of us a pie and things I'm thinking you
[1:33:38] know it'd be like I sitting in the vest
[1:33:39] of you and you are singing in here and
[1:33:41] pies are coming out there what do you do
[1:33:46] well when your own doing wrong dude I
[1:33:48] had a piece of pie
[1:33:50] it's a pie I had a piece of pie
[1:33:53] Jerry didn't cuz he's getting ready to
[1:33:54] preach but I hate pie so here's the
[1:34:03] church and and and and the jury was
[1:34:05] ministering that night on spiritual
[1:34:07] warfare but then how God brings a
[1:34:09] deliverance and once God brings a
[1:34:10] deliverance then let him fill you once
[1:34:14] he's delivered you and so doesn't matter
[1:34:32] how many people are trying to prevent
[1:34:36] someone from coming to Jesus the devil's
[1:34:51] can hold
[1:35:04] so I took that picture so you could see
[1:35:06] I'm sitting on that little porch diría
[1:35:09] this was the house where we're at and we
[1:35:11] would go to eat there later they
[1:35:13] actually take care of that it's an
[1:35:14] Airbnb house and to pan around to show
[1:35:18] you they the congregation or it it was
[1:35:21] just so small I don't even know if that
[1:35:24] the platform was our platform was double
[1:35:27] the size would you say that Jerry of
[1:35:28] what that place was where you were
[1:35:30] preaching it was small I couldn't get in
[1:35:33] so it was really small but people
[1:35:37] traveled to be there
[1:35:41] travelled to be there they so enjoyed
[1:35:45] the word of Lord and I told brother Jes
[1:35:47] I said brother Genesis I said I was
[1:35:48] sitting out there I said and I was
[1:35:49] looking at people you know because
[1:35:51] people walking up and down the road you
[1:35:52] know going back and forth getting fruit
[1:35:54] and things I said Lord what he's
[1:35:56] preaching tonight there's so many people
[1:35:59] who need it and I was sitting there and
[1:36:01] I said God I said let one let that word
[1:36:04] fall on somebody as they're walking by
[1:36:06] well here come two guys trying to tie in
[1:36:10] two wires
[1:36:11] you know they you we call the electric
[1:36:14] company they don't call the electric
[1:36:15] company I don't know how they tell out
[1:36:17] of this conglomeration of wires what
[1:36:19] wires going to your house and how are
[1:36:20] you tied I don't know so these guys I
[1:36:22] watch them make their way down I'm
[1:36:24] sitting there and I want witness to how
[1:36:26] they get the ladder right there and
[1:36:28] here's the one standard of the ladder
[1:36:30] and he's standing there and his brother
[1:36:32] Jerry's preaching I noticed him start
[1:36:34] turning and brother Jerry is dealing
[1:36:36] with that part about the deliverance
[1:36:38] that comes to the come came to Legion
[1:36:40] and how lives that need to be that to be
[1:36:43] set free and that and he his attention
[1:36:46] is caught in that moment the other guys
[1:36:49] up there working and his attention is
[1:36:50] caught I said Lord let the seed be
[1:36:53] planet they might have just decided to
[1:36:58] do the electrical at that time that God
[1:37:01] God orchestrates everything so I'd
[1:37:05] rather just said brother Sammy you don't
[1:37:07] know he said when you we come back he
[1:37:08] said they might be in a church I said
[1:37:10] they very well not be here we are right
[1:37:14] after that meeting and and we had some
[1:37:16] fellowship with the brothers there and
[1:37:19] just some of the brothers there that had
[1:37:22] traveled up is this brother Timothy he's
[1:37:24] a pastor as well this brothers enacted
[1:37:27] he's a medical doctor brother rusty he's
[1:37:30] a pastor as well for the Boyd's the head
[1:37:31] Deacon with brother ll for their adlai
[1:37:34] and then brother Pete
[1:37:35] but the Pete is the first pastor that
[1:37:38] was one through the mystery expose
[1:37:41] he brother Pete you know you've heard
[1:37:44] about brother oil talk about the mystery
[1:37:45] expose brother Pete was a high man in
[1:37:48] his denomination one only a past where
[1:37:50] he was the high man
[1:37:51] but then when God opened his eyes to it
[1:37:53] brother Pete all men he is he's a
[1:37:56] special brother he's a special brother
[1:37:59] it's kind of been hard for his family
[1:38:01] because his family seems such a high
[1:38:02] figure and then they seem here setting
[1:38:05] under a ministry but brother Pete is so
[1:38:09] happy in the Lord
[1:38:29] [Laughter]
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:33] the fetus another feat is really
[1:38:36] something else
[1:38:38] brother ah when he introduced giri of
[1:38:41] myself he says now there the Browning
[1:38:43] brothers and he did it the last time
[1:38:45] then he reiterated again this time he
[1:38:47] said you know Browning makes guns he
[1:38:50] said man he said now the first gun he
[1:38:52] said it's gonna preach he said of either
[1:38:54] it's a heavy artillery it shoots slow
[1:38:57] but it shoots he said now then the next
[1:39:02] kind of comes up as a semi and brother
[1:39:09] Pete was talking about it with Jerry and
[1:39:12] I after that after the November 1
[1:39:14] convention he was saying oh man you know
[1:39:17] he was talking about the morning service
[1:39:19] and my other word come forth you know
[1:39:21] then he said tonight we got the atomic
[1:39:23] bomb and he just smiled so big you know
[1:39:29] it's just so so precious they're just so
[1:39:32] happy in the Lord and every little thing
[1:39:35] they could not think us enough for us
[1:39:38] coming and being there with them and I
[1:39:41] know they wanted us to express that to
[1:39:43] you you know when we went it was a busy
[1:39:47] time we really did and I like that we
[1:39:49] didn't have much downtime I like being
[1:39:51] there and working and and I just was so
[1:39:54] thankful just it's just wonderful when
[1:39:56] you begin to see fruits and the affect
[1:40:00] of the Lord working right there within
[1:40:04] the services sometimes you hear
[1:40:05] testimonies afterwards you know
[1:40:07] sometimes you don't even sometimes
[1:40:09] there's things sometimes you don't even
[1:40:10] know about but then it comes sometimes
[1:40:13] later to you of what God has done but
[1:40:16] it's just it's a wonderful thing just to
[1:40:18] see God working so I want to say I
[1:40:20] appreciate each of you that how you have
[1:40:22] you've supported it and also your
[1:40:25] prayers through your prayers because I
[1:40:27] know you were praying and you were
[1:40:29] praying for us that God would be with us
[1:40:32] and lead us within that and I'll tell
[1:40:35] you God
[1:40:36] heard your prayers he heard your prayers
[1:40:41] and directed all of this and how that
[1:40:45] all come together there's a lot of
[1:40:47] things that I know some of you may have
[1:40:48] seen certain things online and some of
[1:40:50] the services are online but even
[1:40:53] testimonies and things that we were
[1:40:54] shared with the jury and I from the from
[1:40:56] the youth retreat there were still
[1:40:58] testimonies that were coming in even
[1:41:01] afterwards from the youth retreat of
[1:41:03] wall that God had just done just to help
[1:41:06] to the young the ministering to the
[1:41:09] young people so we just give we give
[1:41:11] glory to God and I want to say just so
[1:41:15] thankful for his mercy and what a
[1:41:17] privilege it is to be able a men to
[1:41:20] preach this gospel and a privilege it is
[1:41:23] to be able to serve a man in the kingdom
[1:41:26] of God with you because we're coworkers
[1:41:30] together and and if it wasn't if it
[1:41:34] wasn't for your prayers and support we'd
[1:41:36] never be able to go but God God has seen
[1:41:39] to it and there's also some things that
[1:41:41] I'll talk about at a later time when it
[1:41:43] comes to some there's a warning one need
[1:41:46] over there that's brought to my
[1:41:47] attention but we'll talk about that in a
[1:41:49] later time but I just want to say God
[1:41:51] richly bless you
[1:41:54] and distrust it you were blessed so much
[1:41:56] more many other pictures but yet I think
[1:41:58] we've covered it and may God just richly
[1:42:03] bless you for all of your prayer and
[1:42:07] standing standing right here with the
[1:42:09] work of the Lord sometimes I can't my
[1:42:11] mind I'll be honest with you I don't I
[1:42:13] cannot say that my mind understands why
