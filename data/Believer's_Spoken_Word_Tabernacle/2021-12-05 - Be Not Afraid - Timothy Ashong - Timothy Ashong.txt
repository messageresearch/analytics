ghost this morning amen an empty vessel but aren't you glad he's filled you with his life amen where would i be you only know i'm glad you see through eyes of love a hopeless case in an empty place if not for praise [Music] would i be you only know i'm glad you see through your eyes of love [Music] [Laughter] a hopeless case in an empty place [Music] and lord i thank you for the things i cannot see

sound [Applause] [Laughter] i once was lost thank god i found a hopeless case in an empty place if not for grace [Music] i'm glad you see through your eyes of love a hopeless case [Music] in an empty place if not for grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] a hopeless case an empty place if not for grace a hopeless cave oh yes lords an empty place if not for grace [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah that becomes more real amen you know the longer that you as you serve the lord the more and more you realize it's it really has nothing to do with you the more and more when we recognize that we realize that when we see that that it has nothing to do about us the more we want to give ourselves to him because he's the one to perform it and you know that's all that that's all god asked of us when he god had already already chosen moses to be the servant that he would use before the foundation of the world but god had to get moses in a place to recognize that he needed god he didn't just need to know about god need to know about the promise but he needed to know god and when moses met god in that way god revealed to him i'm the deliverer i'm come down to deliver the people now come i will send thee you know that's the greatest that's the greatest thing that god moves upon our lives is for us to recognize our weaknesses you know not only in coming to that of the new birth to a real surrender like moses did and each of us but it's also even after that recognizing our weaknesses our weaknesses and recognizing where we're too strong but where we are weak he is strong and that's just looking to god and just as the song the words of this song would say what an empty place if not for grace you know it's one thing a person could have a life that's so cleaned up so pristine you could say well not doing this and not doing that but yet if that place is not filled it's still empty you know many times we walk by you see rental properties and houses and we've moved out of houses each one of us apartments and so forth and before you can ever come into the other house or into the apartment you've got to get the stuff out of there [Music] sometimes people rip up the carpeting and the flooring and they they take things out so they can put their things in and god cleans god takes from that life and the real taking of it is god's not wanting to so move into that same place god wants to bring it to a place to where it says lord i want nothing but you and when that comes to that place then god steps in and god says this is not the house that i built but let me raise up my own house and god raises up that house that seed on the inside that there's a desire that's pulsated to serve god for a long time a desire to say there's a got to be a god somewhere there's a reality and god placed that there so that you and i though we were lost but god in his mind we were never lost he knows exactly where we were and he come and he raises up his own house his own temple amen oh i want to just i want to just worship him this morning don't you i want to continue as the word comes forth just to enter in and just to worship him amen thank god for this evening light that god has sent to you and i it's brought clarity and clarity to the path and where we can live and walk in victory as sons and daughters of god amen so good to see each and every one of you i want to remember want to remind you next sunday will be the second sunday of the month we'll be taking the special offering for the entryway project that the trustees have presented and they'll go through some things with you we i believe will send out some things but the shame is that we're sending out that presentation this week so if you have any questions about it you can get the questions and the trustees the brothers can try to address that if there's questions about that at all but lord willing next sunday will start taking us the special offerings on that without any further uh time here i want to just welcome brother timothy to go ahead and make his way and we're just so we're very very thankful amen for all of god's gifts and i'm thankful that brother timothy is able to come by and be with us it didn't look like it at first when we were trying to arrange it back in august or september there but um and i told him yesterday i said i i don't care where you go and i don't care who you miss going to but don't miss coming here and i don't say we just you know as brother dave mentioned in his prayer i i do remember those messages very very clearly and brother timothy came and he preached that message nevertheless and i just really appreciate you know i appreciate all of god's gifts i'm glad that god has such a diversity i'm glad that not every every gift is just a like it shows that within the midst of it though there's the differences but yet what is the common thread is jesus christ that's the common theme that's the that's the commonality within every one of our hearts and we just want to pull on the gift of god this morning amen and just whatever you have need of and there might be something that maybe there's nothing that really comes to mind that you can stand out maybe you're thinking well i don't have a sickness or i don't have something on my job but have this need that is above everything else just say god speak to me i want to be closer to you lord just speak to my heart if there's things in me or in my life anything that would be hindering or keeping that i want to be closer to you lord just speak to me in a personal way and just invite him he he'll come right there and speak right to your your heart that's what i want i want a personal visitation amen a personal visitation amen so let's as we stand and just welcome our brother to come amen would you would you mind singing [Music] or if you have another song on your heart so appreciate our musicians and the song leaders that god has given us i really appreciate every one of them amen i think we're i think we're very blessed that that's really how i feel we're very blessed i i thank god for that amen where would i be yes lord you only know i'm glad you see through your eyes [Laughter] a hopeless case an empty place if not for grace where would i be only know [Music] i'm glad you see through your eyes of love hopeless case in an empty place if not for grace oh a hopeless case an empty place if

the lord and the bible says he sent forth his word to deliver his people so god's word comes to deliver god's people and we are happy that god cares about us and he cares for us and uh let's read a portion of the scriptures this morning as we come to encourage one another let's refer from deuteronomy the fifth book of moses let's read some few things from there woman could the other one say maybe we will read also from matthew 28 so we go to deuteronomy chapter seven let's save time to read from verse 17 if thou shalt say in thy heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them thou shalt never be afraid of them but shall we remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt the great temptations which that i saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the nations all the people of whom that act afraid amen so we read from matthew let's read a little from matthew matthew 28 verse 10 then serve jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brother that they go into galilee and they said they see me let's pray lord once again we thank you for your word we thank you for your faithfulness be with us and minister unto our needs in the name of jesus christ our lord we pray with faith and thanksgiving amen god bless you let's be seated in matthew the same matthew chapter 14 when jesus was walking on the sea and the disciples saw him let's verse 25 matthew 14 25 and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight way jesus speak unto them say be of good cheer it is i be not afraid so this morning be not afraid be not afraid we realize we are living in the shaky times troubles hour pandemic troubled years and troubled day so much uncertainties and the scripture says men's hearts are failing for fear men's hearts are failing for fear because nobody even seems to have the answer scientists don't have the answer what leaders don't have the answer we can't remember what we've just gone through and we are still going through when the whole world was paralyzed when men could not even go out when men begin to fear men when husbands and wives were not sure who gave the virus who didn't get it when we were tormented in our minds fear on every hand parents are afraid children are afraid a difficult time when flight flight was southern airport and seaports and land borders everything closed down and nobody knows what is going to happen what is happening until today they have notified the solution and they tried this and we tried that and everything has been tried and this was and this is not working that is not working this and there is trouble oh we want to find a vaccine we want to do this and we try this and and and others it had a fight and others there was a negative effect and oh so where are we going where are we going men's hearts are feeling for fear but jesus said be not afraid don't fear in this flightful time difficult time things that are causing people to get worried our minds are filled with worried and there is fear within don't you see people walking and talking but there is fear within and if you guess someone says oh my god somebody will be binding in jesus name rebuking in jesus name oh my god there is trouble everywhere so where do we go to whom do we tend to come unto me turn unto jesus be not afraid rest assured calm down rest assured he wants us to cast our case on him in these difficult times when medical science has failed and it's failing when the doctors and the scientists themselves are afraid doctors are afraid of their patients and patients are afraid of their doctors everybody is afraid of somebody because it's not written on somebody's forehead that they get a virus and everybody is afraid but let me tell you the most dangerous virus is unbelief the most dangerous virus is unbelief of god's word for if you believe the word of the lord all things are possible may the lord help us believe us in this hour in which we are living the lord jesus said fear not all through the scriptures every time he comes on the scene he says to his people fear not when there is a situation a crisis problem a challenge on the land when we are confronted with situations that is beyond us all that is said is don't be afraid that is if you trust in the lord if you know who he is if you will cast your cast upon him then what he says is don't be afraid the prophet of god said the greatest trouble there is in the church today is a bunch of fear people always scared and that is of the devil don't be scared be brave you don't have nothing they had nothing to be afraid be brave don't be scared that's it the whole church there's the trouble with the church today he's scared to death but the lord says to us don't be afraid why remember we are not yet by chance we are not yet by accident remember our life journey was planned by jehovah god before the foundation of the world for the bible says that day that he for knew he called them amen so we are not here by chance and we are not a bastard and i want you to know we are not here because we want to be here we are not here because we want to be here we are here because he wants us to be here and you could not have come any other day than today we could not have been here any other day than today because he predestinated you to be in this day and this hour praise the lord and if he choose that i should be here at this hour then he has a purpose for me and for you be here at this hour and then remember if he brought you here at this hour he brought you here you didn't come here on your own but he brought you here then you cannot exist out of here without his permission that's what brother branham said until god has finished with us nothing can take care from here because god brought me here to serve my purpose and god brought you here to serve the purpose and until that purpose have been saved nothing can take anybody out of here nothing because the one that brought us here is watching over us somebody say praise the lord hallelujah listen he brought us here for purpose i am here for purpose you are here for purpose and remember that he has the purpose we are made differently for different purposes we are serving god in different capacities everybody has a path to play you have a path to play and i have a part to play before i came here he knew the number of years allocated for me he did it he allocated it he allocated your own time he allocated mankind and he knows everything about everybody and there is nothing out of cater and there is nothing that surprises our god and there is no power that can act with our god no matter what power no matter what forces there is no power satan cannot sneak in and act with our god because our god is the almighty god our god is the creator our god created the heavens and the earth our god controls the universe and if you are his son and his daughter why are you afraid when the bible tells us that all things worked together for good to those who love the lord those who are called by the lord for his own purpose cast them fear the prophet of god said god does not want his children to fear he wants his children to believe no matter the circumstances no matter what is happening around us no matter how dark it gets he is the light of the world sisters and brothers god don't want you to fear because fear torments and that's why many of us have been tormented we are frustrated we are depressed because of fear oh i don't know what is going to happen the one that knows what is going to happen say trust me you don't know what is happening you can say but he knows all and he said be not afraid if you want to have fear the bible tells us we should fear god the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom that is reverence and respect to god and god wants us to respect him and you respect god by taking his word if you refuse to take that word that's disrespect to god if you are doubting whether god can do this you are disrespecting him oh god have mercy upon us respect him by taking his word because all the time we see god come on the scene and he said don't fear fear came in because of disobedience to his word there was nothing confirmed when the word was being obeyed so fear is result of disobedience when the lord god has already spoken and he fortified them behind his word our fortification is the word when you leave your fortification you will be exposed when you leave your defense the word is our defense and when you leave it your spouse that is why god sees to eat that in every age in every time he sends the world to defend to protect his children may god help us hallelujah to to to hold on to the infallible word of the living god amen be not afraid everybody might be afraid everybody might be troubled because they don't have the big god that we have remember i am the lord that he left all that diseases this scripture is living today he's still alive today and you should be alive until we are out of here he is our protection and he is our defense he that brought it in the secret place secret place of the almighty shall abide under the shadow of the messiah i will say to the lord it is my refuge in god in him will i trust [Music] trust in the lord and cast your case upon him hallelujah trust in the lord hold on to the word because the word of the lord is giving to keep us god speaking to the children of israel and he was telling them when you go to battle or when you are compassed with armies the nations bigger than doubt mightier than thou literally 20. let me read this when that goes out to battle against their enemies and see as us and chariots and a people more than doubt be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of egypt when that goes to battle and thousands their enemies and cs and chariots and people more than doubt be not afraid of them humanly speaking when you are going and you see oh but in this one god tells his children don't be afraid because it is the lord thy god that goes with you he's the creator of the heavens and the earth that is going with you and that same jehovah god is going with us today because he said i will not leave you and i will not forsake you hallelujah the almighty god says to you be not afraid no matter the situation no matter the circumstances no matter what has surrendered you don't be afraid because it doesn't want you to fear the prophet of god said there are two elements that controls everything fear of faith he said each and every one of us here is controlled by one you're either controlled by fear or control by faith so as we are here what is controlling you because your behavior your absence your conduct shows what is controlling you what is controlling us your behavior your attitude because by our absence it shows what is there your at what expression is us only the manifestation of the one that is inside you or what is controlling you it does not matter what you see your expression will show because the tree is known but the fruit is are we together what is controlling our lives what are you afraid of and why are you afraid why are you afraid hallelujah praise the name of the lord you that's the trouble you are afraid when you ask you won't receive that's the reason you don't receive don't be scared ask and then believe you are going to get it and you'll get it he said the trouble that's the trouble with the trap today is scared to death you are going to make a failure how can you fail when you are in christ you can't fail how can you fail when you are in christ how can you fail but this has fear hey i don't think i'm good fear will bring failure but when you are in christ so it is very important to check and make sure that we are in christ because he is our safety he is our protection he is our defense and if you are forgotten you are being reminded that there is no failure in christ hey stop looking at yourself and your ability [Applause] stop looking at that because you will fail as a man but he can't fail so cast your case on him rely on him rest on his word amen are we together don't let the devil beat you down with fear and you are going to die i know everybody will die anyhow hey listen it is not this virus coronavirus killing people people are dying of heartache heart failures and this and that and that one time my brother came to me a friend enough from south africa missionary that everything we want to eat is sometimes he will put sugar on it i said brother this is too much it's a timothy if sugar don't kill you salt will kill you he says something will kill you if not high blood pressure low blood pressure if not high sugar low sugar something you leave here somehow but death is not the end there is love beyond that [Applause] so stop fearing and don't let him keep convincing you because jesus came to deliver us out of fear the fear of death the fear of failure for you to rely on him that in jesus christ we are more than conquerors in jesus christ we will dispose the enemy in jesus christ we are more than overcomers it is our victory so be not afraid it does not matter oh this one died this way and that one that that's fine that's okay but it does not mean that i will also go that way you know since there's nothing to fear listen everyone that is here like i've said when this advice you saw this pandemic broke as a listing if god never saw me going out through this i will never go no god never saw you going you know if god saw you that you went out of this nothing can change it and nobody can force it to happen because he is the controller so brethren let's stop fear let's stop worry and let's trust the lord you see we have been brought here for different purposes brother branham said when god is finished with me i don't want to stay here one minute i'm gone i have two people i say if i'm preaching here if i fall down dead now what i expect you to do is get around pray if you pray and god wants me to come back i'll come back if not i'm going to forget go ahead if god is not ready for me i can't go and if god is not ready for you can't go so don't let the enemy be tormenting you with that let the enemy know that look god i came here for purpose somebody brought me here and until he has seen this with me there is nothing you can do [Applause] be not afraid let's make our father happy let's make jehovah happy so that he looks at this are my children indeed that's why shut up messiah can i believe we read about them our god is able to deliver us but if he doesn't we are not going to change what we believe because it is animal be saying today you should be able to say my god is able to heal me to protect me to watch over me but if he doesn't he's suffering god is suffering he does what pleases him and once he decides to not end something nobody can change it no amount of prayer can change it no matter anything he can do change it because he's suffering amen hallelujah you read the scriptures i said don't compare yourself to anybody if you do that the bible says you are not wise because i'm different you are different like i've said john the baptist the time he was born and the time jesus was born just six months apart herod when he heard about the birth of christ and the wise men came there he waited for them and they did not come and then arrows sent an order that they should go and kill all the children from two years down joseph was told to jesus to take jesus out but nothing was said about john the baptist so john the baptist was there when ernest was killing the children but god protected him nothing happened to him he didn't go anywhere but nothing happened to him and nothing will happen to you it does not matter what will be happening around nothing will touch you because god has a purpose for your life john grew up he came to serve the purpose of god until when that purpose was finished he preached the gospel he rebuked errol he rebuked erodius he condemned them for their evil things committing adultery and living in adultery and a prostitute they asked for the end of john the baptist god could have prevented it because the bible said the greatness of all prophets was john the baptist of all that were born of women none greater than john the baptist yet he has to be buried without his head a great prophet like john the baptist was it because he failed was it because god was not mindful no god was there and he has to go that way jesus was on the scene at that time but god has a purpose for everybody our coming in and are going out praise the lord hallelujah don't fear be not afraid believe what the bible says believe the word of the lord that's why god sent a prophet to us today to preach he said what am i trying to do to drive away fear and that's what i'm trying to do to drive i was here in this flightful and fearful times in which we are living don't work in fear walk in fights commit your life commit your way to god's hands live a righteous life live a holy life i mean as a christian as a believer like i've said jesus one day asked his disciples who do men say i the son of man whom do they say i am whole son said elijah also said john the baptist sunset jeremiah said one of the prophets so wonderful is listening all the names they mentioned with people that fear god and why they miss you all these prophets because each and every one of them lived part of the life of christ he was in david he was in jeremiah he was in moses he was ezekiel everyone of the prophet was manifesting part of the life of christ and so today what are we who are we then the question comes jesus said whom do men say i the son of man because the people have looked at his life and sometimes he speaks like moses he lives like jeremiah he did like this and that now the question comes whom do they say you are you also whom do the people say you are your neighbors your colleagues your associates your place of work whom do they say you are your life is reflecting who your character is reflecting who your asses your belief your habits who is it reflecting who do they say you are can they say you're a christian can they say a daughter of god can they say oh like john oh like peter like johanna like suzuana like mary like whom do they say you are who are you reflecting because if you believe this message you will refer jesus christ if you're a believer of this word of the lord message of this hour that has been given to us you will reflect christ the ultimate is the only god's baptism to reflect our life to show jesus in our lives as they said about the christians in the beginning they were christians the bible said they were called christians at antioch because they saw their lives yes christ this one like like that man christ that's why the god that were christians so in your behavior and your attitude who does he reflect are you reflecting christ the bible said though he was god he thought it not roughly to be equal with god but humble itself and made himself of no reputation him humble himself and made himself of no reputation of death their calling names they call him even visible chief of demons his father forgive they don't even know what they are saying what about you why do you get offended what about you what about the woman that came to jesus and jesus said i can't take the children's bread and cast it to dogs jesus called that woman dog i can't take the children's breath and cast it to dogs did he get offended he said no he said lord you are right you are right it is not right to take the children's bread and cast it to dusk when the children have not eaten he said listen faith always acknowledges that the word is the truth listen we are too much a life of ourselves we think too much of ourselves i am this i am fine but if you are a christian you must come under the world you must die to the flesh to our thinkings and our ideas and our words we too might get offended i'm not going to church again i don't want to talk to that brother again is this scripture not to talk to your brother is this creature not to talk with sister is it scripture giving jesus said if you greet those who only greet you what more are you doing even the hittings they do they say the life of the christian is to go the extra mile to do what the ordinary person cannot do and when the holy ghost is there we will do it so what life are we living it's not enough to say i believe the message if you believe the message leave the message work the message talk the message reflect the message reflect christ [Applause] didn't jesus said love your enemies love your enemies pray for those who despitefully use you didn't jesus said it so what life are we living today do you love your enemies do you love those who criticize you and speak evil about you and condemn you when you have not done anything do you love them or what do you do he knows my heart and he knows your heart he knows your conduct in those man do you love your enemy do you love a brother that disagrees with you or sister that disagrees with you do you love it hey it's not just a matter of coming to church we need the holy ghost we need christ we need the revelation of the world can we come to church and we are not even on talking tents with our brothers and our sisters how can you be on taking time with god the bible read the bible how can a man say he loves god when he doesn't love his fellow man that he sees with his eye that's the bible i'm just cutting the scriptures because the bible says he that would say he loves my god and he doesn't love his fellow man he's a liar the bible says so your life and my life is examined by god's word think about it and repent and straighten up that is what the word is here for to strengthen us up because it is not your standard it's not my standard it is god's standard it is not what you say or what you think about yourself but it is what the word says about you praise the lord sorry if i'm keeping you quiet but it will go anyhow blessed be the name of the lord are we understanding that listen we are very close to the coming of the lord we are in the end time the end of the end is here the time is late what are you here for to add to the number to be a benchwoman what are you here for i am here to check my social media with god's word i want to line up with god's word i want to make the rapture i'm tired of this sinful word i want to get out of here and god praise the lord oh god help us unless the sense of god don't compare your life to anybody the bible says son through the flood sun through great sorrows sown through this some true that but all through the blood of the believers were bent to death some of the believers fire could not touch them is it because those who fire could not touch them we see because they were stronger than those that the firemen no they were all heroes of the faith these believers that were bent at stake and they stood there we would not deny our lord men like polycarb many of the brothers oh john huss different people they had the right the bible talked about in the book of hebrews hebrews 11 he said they refused deliverance they refused deliverance that they might attain a better resurrection they could have gone away they could have ran if only they had compromised they said no we will not compromise they walk to the state and they stood there and the whole the the people wanted to watching them and people laughing calling them all names and it's their students on their faith oh heroes of the faith and they set fire on them jonah said father lord i come in my spirit on today jesus son of david have mercy on me when the priest said we commit your soul cannot say we commit your soul to the devil is a common soul to the lord they were heroes god determined that they should go they said the blood of the saints the blood of the matters is the seed of the side at the church they shed their blood this only god's gospel dripping with blood i've been to some of the arenas in rome when they went they released lions to eat our brothers and those warriors they were men and women of faith in respect babysitting all together were given to lions but they stood and defied the lions we are not going to bow we're going to serve god we are not going to renounce jesus he is our lord is our savior our god disabled and the student to the shame of those admirers they did not surrender they didn't believe in fear don't live in fights some of these believers oh hallelujah they stood they went into the fire and they quit the violence of fire the flames of fire they quench it by faith by faith they refuse to give up they die by faith they quit the violence of fire all this were done by faith not fear don't live under fear listen there was a time peter was arrested they wanted to kill peter and they put him in chains sleeping among soldiers and they put it right to the inner chambers enough said what they keep creaming us they kept him over there nothing to touch nobody to gone yet the believers prayed but remember before peter was arrested herald has already killed james one of the head is james and he said he moved forward because the people were happy killing james so he moved forward to arrest me hannah said when james was arrested did the believer prayed or they didn't pray they prayed but god allowed james to be killed the same believers prayed and the angel of the lord came down and he went right to the prison and it's a priest to get up and he took get up take your standards he took

night there is no darkness in the sight of god the one that watches over you in the day is the same one that watches over you in the night so there is no need to fear in the night there's no need to fear any time god told abraham to your old age i am god you have to fear we don't have to fear we have to believe god when everybody is afraid when everybody is fearing we are the ones to tell them don't believe our god trust in our god our god we make a way our god is our protection our god is our peace oh be not afraid to stomach your coffee since this is very important in this hour a thousand will fall at your side ten thousand at your right hand then he said if thousand people die with coronavirus or that will fail they said the new amicron whatever whatever stages it comes the god has taken us through first stage second state let it go to thousand states we'll go through when the scientists and the physicians are looking for the answer are looking for healing and looking for solutions jesus is the solution he said i am the lord that he let all right that will be and that will be and that has been i am the one he is our healer he is our savior he is our protection be not afraid fear not what man can do if you have anything to fear fear god hallelujah why did the children of israel fail to enter the promised land fear they were afraid because they look at it look at the giant they look at this one there look at this one die that of this one this one suffer this one so what it didn't mean nothing to god there was a joshua and there was a killing and they said hey let's go to possess the land because this is what god said to us they were not afraid those who were afraid didn't enter the land why are they always here then there is no value in fear so what do you fear why do you hold on to something that has no value in it why do you worry jesus said which of us might worry can i give you one inch to your ear when he told us that even he knows the number of our head he said why we not fall without annoying what do we fear why are you afraid trust me cast your case upon me that's what he says listen when we are in crisis and challenging time as we are in today that is when we are to trust the lord more in crisis time in difficult times that is where faith is displayed that's when faith goes into action that's when faith is manifested because all these challenges are opportunities for faith the prophet said excise your faith they didn't enter the promised land because of fear who this problem there because look he was telling them he said remember when you will say these nations are bigger than us these nations have this how we're going to dispose them he said remember what i did for you what i did to pharaoh and to remember that can you remember what god has done for you look back into your life look back into your life how are you alive today how are you where you are today look back god don't want us to forget amen he said remember what i did to pharaoh the pharaohs that were one controlling your life the powers that was one rule in your life remember where i brought you from from the iron fairness from bandage who could have done that except our god to take a whole nation he said remember the things that i did in egypt pledged upon place and when those places were happening he said listen he kept israel from it do you know that even mosquito didn't go to goshen he kept all the virus he kept on from then when the whole line was being plagued it was plagued upon plague and this word is going to face plague upon plague the prophet said there will be diseases in the last days place in the last days that doctors has nothing no answer he said every cancer will look like a toothache and do you know how much tooth aid can bend whoa do you ever had it too fake did anybody had it before brother it's terrible i had one i had the ones i said doctor take it out but faith is the master of all circumstances is the master of all circumstances that no matter what it will be no matter the place no matter the diseases no matter what we come faith is the master of all circumstances that is why we need faith in this hour jesus said have faith in god enough of fear enough of worry let's turn to faith because worry has never helped us fear has never helped us so let's go to what will help us if you are taking something you tried this disease and that medicine and that is you go for another you look for something better than this and the better than all is the faith in jehovah god amen that is believe what he says don't reason with it take his attitudes trust in the lord before your heart praise the lord i know you think this guy is crazy but that's happy to do so far i like to be crazy this way because in the first place you can't serve god in your own mind you need the mind of christ the bible says let this mind which was in christ being in you the mind of christ who said father that will be done the mind of christ is to do the will of the father the mind of christ is to stay with the word of god and that's what we need in this hour to cast down reasons god help us be not afraid the children of israel are coming out of egypt and god is reminding remember let's let's negotiate that place if thou shall say in thy heart these nations are more than i how can i dispose them how can i get over this situation how can i get over this mountain i cannot overcome how can i make it how did you make it today when this pandemic broke out and everybody was afraid how did we come to where we are today he took care of us you might have contacted or be in contact with people that had the virus that did themselves didn't know that you didn't know and god took care of us he protected you listen it does not matter listen it does not matter you can live in the midst of one million people with corona battles and you will not get it believe god's word a thousand will fall at your side ten thousand at your right hand it does not come near you but when you see it the thing that i hear comes upon me i'm not saying that you should be foolish are you understanding because you are not supposed to tame the lord god protect you so you go and stand on the street and say god i know you protect me you have been foolish when we have come to a situation or we have applied all that should be applied you've done all that should be done it's sanitizer do this and move your mind saying what you have done what should be done that's what you have to do you leave the rest in the hands of the lord are we following that are we together and trust the lord i'm making this journey by the grace of almighty god lord i have done what i should do yes i leave the rest in your hands god wants us to walk in faith not in fear and god said to them if you say oh i cannot dispose these nations because god said hey the anakins are there the jebusites are there is a problem god said there is a problem there and if you say how can i overcome how can i dispose these people he said remember that shall not be afraid of them but shall well shall we remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and to all egypt that shall well remember what the lord thy god did unto faith in our egypt egypt was shut down egypt went into darkness and god protected his children and brought them out with a mighty hand he took them through with a mighty hand he said you shall well remember what i did god don't want us to forget is goodness to us great is thy faithfulness lord unto us morning by money new messages we see morning by morning new messages we see great this is faithfulness to us which one of us remember to be grateful to god amen don't see them and be complaining and remembering god hates to see his children complaining and memory god hate it why have i failed you why are you complaining why are you memory why are you crying he said to moses why are you crying did i fail have i failed why are you crying god hates that god wants us to walk in faith god wants us to believe he said why you're crying speak the word and go the egyptians you have seen today you will never see them again he didn't tell him what he was going to do he said but he will never see them again i'm going to fight don't fear he makes a way where there is no way he makes a way the god we are speaking about is the god that opened the red sea why did he make them go all the way before he opened their sea why did he make them to even drink the bitter water of mara before he sweetened it why did he made them to test in the wilderness before he gave them water he gave them water out of rock we're not afraid he's our sustainer our provider and our sustainer to take us through this journey there will be trials there'll be difficulties there'll be challenges but is more than able to take us through [Applause] because he's faithful be not afraid dear brother be not afraid dear sister tell somebody by you be not afraid tell your wife be not afraid tell your brother tell somebody be not a friend we are serving the living god hey he can do anything how did he make abraham to stay until he was 100 years before he gave birth they've married abraham and said i were married for over 75 years abroad said they would have married when said i was about 18 or 15 years and then god called abraham when he was 75 years old and remember god spoke to abraham when god spoke to abraham told him that said how we give back the bible says abraham laugh read the bible he said shall a child be born to him that is hundred years old and said that that is 19 years old give birth that's when god said is there anything to have for me to do are we there there is nothing that god cannot do his plan and his purpose from force for them amen and i said listen do you know that after a hundred years abraham who he asked god what she said a child be born to him that is hundred years old do you know that after 100 years he was still giving birth after the death of sarah abraham married and he gave birth to about thank you they will say so god can do exceedingly abundantly mightily wonderfully beyond our expectation beyond what you can think about beyond our imagination be not afraid i have been suffering with this disease have been suffering with cancer i've been serving for different it doesn't matter to god yes you might be suffering yeah you might be facing reproaches but it doesn't matter to god he has a time he has an hour he has an appointment and when that i come nothing can stop it he had a vision of you before the foundation of the world he knew the time you'll be here he knew what to be going through remember the vision is for an appointed time at the end it will speak it will never fail he is your healer he's a deliverer it's our serpent it's more than evil be not afraid what are we afraid of what are we afraid of what are you afraid of hallelujah when we believe in the bible one of these days we shall drop this veil of flesh shall take another body on the dead in christ arise you talking about that the dead in christ not only that all creation will rise up all humans will rise up there will be a great judgment why transgender everything we can with what bodies i don't know how will they come but god will fix it and they will come with a body so what are we afraid of what are you afraid of if you can make bodies that have been even people that have been eaten by lions people that were burned by fire they are coming with a body amen our god can do anything be not afraid even if you are thrown to the feet see even the fish will eat you a lion will eat a fire it doesn't mean nothing to god that's why it took exactly to the valley of the dry bones and he said exactly it's a valley and he said what do you see ezekiel he said ah dry bones and god said drivers isaac said there are very many and god said son of man can these bones lease i don't know that noise thou knowest thou knowest and that knowledge so talk exactly speak to the bibles prophesied i'm gonna change the situation here when god's word is believed he will do supernatural things it's our god today it's not dead it's not just an historical god it's the god of history and it's the god of the night being unafraid oh i've got a battery wound it can heal the burning wound amen i got a crippled hand he can strengthen that people's hand i get a brown eye he can heal that blind eye he's unlimited don't think that those days have passed the supernatural is here days of miracles are here and it will be here till we are out of here your situation my situation can be changed anytime because he did that for abraham he did that for sarah he didn't oh man be not afraid [Applause] at the grave of lazarus when he came there mata went to jesus he said now that you are here if you have been here my brother would not have died but now that you're here he knew the condition of lazarus already that's why he went away and when he heard that lazarus i'm glad i was not there because there was a plan of god because there was a purpose of god to prove that this jehovah this jesus human way god defense has power over corruption has power he has raised that he has opened the blind's eye the blind people he has done that but he wanted to see that beyond death he still controls that corruption is nothing beyond him he's more than able even when somebody was dead and corrupted and schemed once he knew he want to prove today for them to know that there is nothing to fear there is nothing to fear saints of god when we are in christ there is nothing to fear the great could not hold him death could not keep him or he could not hold him and nothing can hold us nothing can hold us no sickness no disease no power can hold us we are serving the living god be not afraid [Applause] amen my brother stop questioning the word of god amen stop doubting if you have any that doubt your own doubt he's the lord jesus and he said your brother shall rise again and she said oh i know in the resurrection he said i am the resurrection amen i am that restoration

the light yeah yeah i praise the lord but they don't know what was being talked about he said why did you bury him he keep the light becomes unfold every now and then he makes it plainer and plainer

plainer don't kill yourself for what you don't understand just follow him children of the light keep walking in the light watch and see more unfold like what he said where did you better him let's go there oh my what a savior what a savior what the savior what the senior the high priest of our confession that can be taught with the feelings of our infirmities that we define when we are whipping when we are in pain is he paid with us our sakura is amazing to us where did you bury him the people said couldn't this man ask cause that lazarus should not have died at all yes he could but there was something you want to do there was a purpose for it and there is a purpose for everything and the heavy there is a purpose for you there is a purpose where you are here there is a purpose whatever is happening that's your case upon you this shouldn't couldn't this man has made it allah should not have done he could have done it but he has a purpose for them to know that he has power over corruption that even if a man is dead and dead and dead and he can still raise him up what do you do about him here the bible says and jesus worked the high priest he can feel it with us he understands he knows your condition how he feels for you he'll be the pain for you but he said my son my daughter just hold on for a while just a moment just be just a moment i've not forgotten you

death we are not defeated take away the stone of unbelief from there take away the stone of risley from there when they did he went down he said lazarus comfort and corruption knew the maker death gave up corruption gave up the grave gave up because the creator was speaking the great i am speaking the great heal i was speaking the great deliverer was speaking be not afraid he's more than able don't fear don't make look at goliath the size of goliath and the doctor definition and this definition and that definition make your heart to collapse oh the doctor said this oh the lab report said

be with us as we match forward let's match forward in faith let's live in faith let's keep trusting the lord whatever situation young men young women mothers fathers husbands and wives there is nothing to forget our god is abundantly able an apostle paul said my god shall supply all your needs according to its riches in glory in christ jesus he said be careful for nothing in everything with prayer and supplication let that request be made new unto the lord for he has promised i will never leave you and i will never forsake you be not afraid god bless you let god be with us let's keep pressing on but the assam can amen have you been encouraged amen it's the same theme no matter what country you're in because he's the same god and the reality is that we we see here in this one word that i continue to just go over my heart was brother timothy was speaking is the word perspective perspective is everything you know when you you hear one report from the spies who went over their perspective was is we're defeated but in whose eyes in their own eyes in their own eyes they never walked up to a giant and said mr giant what do i look like to you you look like a grasshopper okay thank you so i that was their own mind they took they looked at the situation but they failed to look to the word of god the god who brought them there joshua and caleb they've seen the same giants they you know joshua and caleb didn't say my we we must not have been in the same place we saw only little people you guys saw big people no no joshua and caleb saw the same people but when you listen to joshua and caleb's testimony they don't focus on the giants because really what's important is to focus on the god who has brought us here it's the god who made the promise and in taking that possession it's to focus on him so it really doesn't matter what's in the land doesn't matter what comes up doesn't matter what circumstance he's still jehovah jireh oh my i tell you if one thing that we can take even from these things how that god through the message of the hour we speak of the message of the hour i'm not talking about books i'm not talking about tapes i'm not talking about quotes i'm talking about jesus christ because the message is christ when that that anchor and that is there you look beyond circumstances circumstances can come fear can try to come but it's what you focus on these are the themes i i think of it that how god used brother timothy to speak to our hearts here this morning this is a word from the lord [Music] and i can tell you no matter what it is god was very clear that in christ there is nothing to fear and if we and if there is fear whether it's doctor's report whether it's coronavirus or the next virus and maybe they'll come up with the second greek alphabet i don't know whatever god has placed us here and there's nothing can defeat the purpose of god god did not ask us to do to defend for ourselves and try to fend for ourselves it's only frustration worry and everything else if the doctor's report has said a certain thing we have a different report that we place above that report who hath believed our report that's what matters above every other report and we believe that we believe that in this hour the stabilizers as the prophet said have been put on the ship so no matter what comes our way we can look to god and know that god is faithful to direct our lives that we can walk in a perfect faith you know it depends on what you feed on you with me it depends on what you feed on whatever you feed on you will feel the effects of it and there should be no word no article nothing that should be placed above the word of god or that we even give equalness to nothing because there is nothing equal to god no matter what comes up we say he's the almighty god he's the almighty god god is over it all and it's a time of real examination be sure that you're in christ and if you're in christ and you you you've got to looking this and looking at that just be honest before god well lord i'm just trying to be wise you know say god i was fearful i'm fearful about this look god is not ashamed god doesn't say oh you got a doctor's report and you were fearful oh i'm so ashamed of you no no david said i cried unto the lord this poor man cried unto the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears god comes to honesty and i've done whatever it is i can go to him he's not ashamed of me but he'll come and he'll minister what i have need of to lift me in that moment he's the same god for every one of us amen we we have been encouraged by the things of god and you know what that does when encouragement comes as as god was speaking here to us there's a reflection that comes out in our life you know i i just i marveled it seemed like how god used brother timothy here this morning and it was like taking things that's been ministered all the other ministers here as well taking things that's been ministered a culmination over the year and just it was like ends ends coming together are you with me ends up with where brother daryl was at with with here with with lazarus and the resurrection power of corruption how god speaking be not afraid and when brother wayne was here focus on the vindicated word of god all these things all the way through god has a purpose and that purpose cannot be defeated you know just like he said you don't go stand in the middle of the street but yet it's like this how many times when we you have to go somewhere you have to go somewhere whether you go to work or whether you you don't think about getting in your car and say my goodness my chance of survival is at such and such a rate you know in reality in statistics you have a less chance of survival in a car than you do from coronavirus [Music] that's facts i'm not i'm not making that up that's just statistics i'm not making these things up that's just statistics but you see it's all perspective it's perspective and things begin as things start to happen you let things where and it is seen things can happen and it seems to give validity to this we need to follow this oh we need to do this we need you let someone in a family are you hearing me you let someone die in a car accident in a family if it's not careful that fear will come all the way through that family it'll come all the way through is to let somebody die suddenly of a heart attack all of a sudden everybody's got i got chest pains but see it's recognize that you may have come through that but it's to recognize fear itself then of a situation that you didn't have control over it's a situation when god maybe as a child of god took that person home but god never meant that to bring fear but satan is an opportunist to try to use that to inject fear oh you're starting to feel this way maybe you've got clogged arteries god never brings anxiousness god never brings fear and he never brings condemnation the word will bring conviction always pointing us to the cross is that right it'll always bring peace and strength within our lives that god has god has all this covered and they can just say it like this look look at your neighbor and say god's got this covered he's got it covered he's already got it covered and you know this is not this is not it's not fine print you know what i mean brother richard it's not like where you have to get the the the telescope that they look out there and say oh what did the fine print say oh everything you're covered this is a life insurance oh life insurance policy but if this happens we will not cover that no no there's no fine print in here you know why they put it in fine print because they don't want you to read it and we don't read it right do you agree to these terms agree right but in god's word there's no fine print but every word he said he means it every word he said is yeah amen and he's the same god that'll fulfill every word no matter the conditions he's still the same great i am amen he said don't fear lo i am with thee always whether so ever thou goest amen you have a decision to make take jesus [Music] you have somewhere to go take jesus invite jesus take jesus with you god is an ever-present help in the time of trouble amen i believe i can say within this time we have been so encouraged in the things of god amen strengthened edified amen oh my don't you just love the lord you know sometimes i just wish i could take the holy spirit out and just hug him up and think thank you lord thank you lord oh it's so good too but to think one of these days one of these days i'm a part of that number that's going to crown him king of kings and lord of lords part of that number hallelujah and i'll be able to fall down at his feet and say lord i'm here because of your grace you've provided lord you made a way lord jesus you've brought me lord you've brought me home oh my praise the lord i'm so happy aren't you i just i just you just look forward to coming to the house of god look forward to hearing the word of god it's changing us you believe that it's changing us even as that word is penetrating our life it's changing our lives we rejoice in it but there's a greater change than even what we're aware of that's taking place our faith has been built in this service it's been further built in this service by god himself amen hallelujah oh my can we just let's just stand and can we just thank him i want to just take a moment we we have we've had prayer at the beginning of service we've we did thank him and we asked we had requests but can we just agree together here say lord i'm not even i'm not even coming here right now because of a request there's needs i have on my heart but i want to say thank you for the direction and the leadership that even what is before me and what will come before me you have strengthened me lord let's just go to him in prayer let's thinking lord jesus we have come lord this

your word lord that was delivered to our heart by the spirit of god that right here in this moment lord as we see that you're the same god that kept the hebrew children when they faced the fiery furnace they walked into that and they walked into that with a promise then whether you deliver them from the furnace or not they were going to be delivered from the decree of the king and they chose lord as they walked in there like daniel like all of them of old lord these men were not supermen they knew a supernatural god and their confidence was in the supernatural god that even in that moment not even feeling anything when they would go in there not even having a word that would say i'm going to shut the mouth of the lions daniel no they didn't have that but they had something that was greater than that they had faith in you lord to trust you that whether you delivered them out of the lands or not nothing could touch or hinder their journey and the destination back into the bosom of almighty god and there's nothing lord that can stop or hinder a believer's journey lord we're going back to where we come from we're going back and we thank you for that lord thank you for the holy
