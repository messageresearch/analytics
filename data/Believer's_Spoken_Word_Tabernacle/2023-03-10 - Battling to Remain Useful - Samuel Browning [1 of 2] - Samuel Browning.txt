[Music] your spirit floods My Soul Your Presence makes me whole oh Father take control of all high end the Lord my heart's one desire is your concerning part whatever you require Lord I am overtake me with your glory glory overwhelming I am yours [Music] foreign [Music] Lord overtake me amen more of more of you less of me amen my I just I tell you what a privilege it is for us to even be able to come to that place to recognize we need more of him I need you Lord I can't do nothing without you I need you I need more of you that's what real that's what real maturity is about it's it's about us realizing that our dependency on him not that we have become ragdolls because you know with the Ragdoll you can't do nothing but if we yield to him this is the direction he's going we just give our hand to him this way he's going this way we give our hand to him this way remember how brother Branham traumatized it over and over of putting on the jacket he said you take a little boy he can get his arm in one hole but then he'll Spin and spin and spin trying to get his arm in the other hole he said but if we'll just put our hand in his hand he'll guide it into the whole that's what the REM said overcoming [Music] my it's overcoming isn't I am standing out like this no it's surrendering to him and then it's he through us overcoming and we're Overcomers and you know what really you say well how is that he's the one that's overcoming because really what we've had to do in order for him to manifest is to overcome our own will and that's the victory that's what led to Calvary that's where the victory was in Gethsemane that's what brought the unity between God and man once again and that's the same thing not only as it leads us to the new birth but in every aspect of our life is when we can get ourselves out of the way how many know there's a sometimes there's a continual wrestling there's a wrestling it doesn't go away Paul said in Galatians 5 that the flesh lusteth against the spirit capital s then he goes and brings it the other way there's a wrestling that goes on but oh my as we're in his presence it gives us strength we're in contact with him to yield this outer man and yield Our Lives to God amen because really it's not God coming through our flesh it's God operating through that ordained channel in our life that's that soul that come predestinated from God and then it operates it God manifests his will through every other channel of our life we need him we need him I I need him I need him every moment I need for everything that God has called us for we need him amen let's just go to him in prayer heavenly father as we bow our hearts this evening Lord how wonderful it is to be gathered together with the brothers and sisters Lord of like Precious faith and father we pray that God not only in the visible but the invisible audience we ask that God that may your spirit Lord just go forth Lord to minister to our needs for God as we read in your word and we Are Witnesses Lord for we have received of Lord ministering Spirits or God that have been set forth to minister to us Lord as Heirs of Salvation and here we are tonight Lord once again presenting ourselves Lord that God that you would come there would be a ministering Spirit Lord the holy spirit that would take control tonight Lord and ministered Lord to The Heirs of Salvation oh God may you have your way tonight Lord As We Lay aside every care of this life lay aside God all things that we might receive from you Lord for I'm certain that there are things that we lay aside now that God even as the service would go on that Lord he would pass from us Lord and we walk out as changed people Lord granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you tonight amen so thankful for the musicians in the song service and um amen let's turn to job 22. and uh I want to just read verse 2 and we'll let you be seated I want to remind you you no doubt you've looked at the calendar here for a few weeks brother Nathan Erickson will be standing in here the Sunday for us and Lord willing um I leave out tomorrow for uh for Alabama to minister there with brother Homer Longoria to minister for them and so uh just ask that you just keep us in prayer and we'll certainly be remembering you in prayer that God will just have his way Amen in both in both places so we want to look here into the word of the Lord and also brother Stephen of Bali from Uganda you know brother Stevens a good friend he's been here at the times when he comes to the states he does come through here and so Lord willing next Thursday he'll be in here to minister for us the word of the Lord so just looking forward to that and so we just want to make ourselves him in ready for that amen you're excited for the word amen verse 2 amen can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself and if I can read one more scripture this is the question remember in life as in there's some few other statements that a life has made regarding this that I read to you some weeks ago and this is an account where God which we're familiar with in verse 8 of Job chapter 1. and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that's that's a powerful statement for God to be able to call us his servant remember what a servant is it's not a Slave it's one who gives himself up to another's will that's what a servant is when it says in Philippians he took the form of a servant give ourselves up to another's will so hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man oh my goodness does that mean that job was Flawless yes and no he was not Flawless in that he was a perfect man where he made no mistakes but he had a perfect sacrifice and job's confession was in the sacrifice if there was anything that came job's way that would somehow take him away from what the sacrifice was saying job quickly went back to where his life could say the same thing the sacrifice was saying that's Grace isn't it he was a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and to skeweth evil that word askeweth means he would depart the evil coming and he would turn from the evil amen may God bless the word as you're being seated tonight I told the brothers I text them and I said you know I I gave him the title some time ago today and a useful life but I said you know hold on I don't know if I'm going to leave that title on there or not you know and sometimes I Can Begin accused of had other brothers of my friends tease me for sometimes the long titles that I would give and I try to be very short with him to be purposeful but that's just how my mind operates but if I could tonight if we think of it and I know they probably already have that there is a useful life but if we could tonight I'd like to just because I know they'll have to title it on the um service later on but maybe brother Brian brother Sean them can write it down and that is remaining useful to the Lord remaining useful because we're talking about a useful life and as these things have just continued to open and unfold here before us I I want to say it in this way I actually at one point had thought maybe I would title it the battle for usefulness and because that still pertains in there because any time and when God uses a vessel Satan is always there to try to hinder it and remember remember what being useful is God he pours himself into our weaknesses he doesn't use our weaknesses but when our use our weaknesses are surrendered to him he pours himself in and then he uses himself and that's how when Paul was received that Revelation from God that my strength when God said to Paul my strength is made perfect in weakness that's on according to our mind and I just say when I say ours I'm including myself that our time of where we feel like that we are of the Apex and the greatest strength is when we feel like we've got everything under control and everything is just right in you know right going just exactly the way it seemingly ought to go and but yet that's the time that where our strength is actually at the maximum but it's when things itself is out of our control it's when the tests and trials it comes through many different ways remember Peter recorded the trials and temptations Peters said manifold Temptations if need be so many that means a variety in how things will come to us and so just to remember it's God using himself and we we want to remain as a useful Channel and that's a battle brother Branham remember as even he stood on the platform it was a battle you remember when the Holy Spirit told him there's a test coming for you warned him now what did Brother Branham do when that test was presented or as far as when God told him that he availed himself in prayer and by availing himself in prayer here in a meeting how this how because God didn't let him know this is what it's going to be God did not let him know the scenario but here right there sitting there on the front row was a young man and a young lady making out right in the service and the Holy Spirit told him said say whatever you will and that's the way it shall be remember brother Branham he spoke to him he says please don't do that into the house of God don't don't do that and he's brother Brahm addresses them on that he did not know that that was the test did not know that was coming but he knew there's a test that's coming to Avail myself and I'll just say it in this way to me if we take from that and I believe when I look through the message of the hour when I'm studying when I am listening I don't just look at things as isolated events like oh let me rehearse this about brother random no I believe God was saying something to you and I that we don't know where a test is coming from but one thing let us Avail ourselves in prayer because that's the only thing that's going to give us the right direction at that moment is being so taken with his presence to where brother random could speak to those and says you know he could have there could have been a consuming of them they went on after what he said and continued to do that but notice the grace of God that swept in there when the prophet said you know I forgive you for that notice God's grace that swept in for the rest of that meeting how powerful it was I think of when we look at this that I come back to this this out of that day at Calvary and I've been you know I've been just drawing from this here for weeks on end and that's just been a a a just a powerful message just going through and I want to go back into that here tonight and just to dwell on these things just a little bit and brother Brown says the first thing I want to say Jesus never lived for himself I want you to think about that tonight what does it mean to live his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself we're going to look at a few of these things in just a moment he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others now brother Brahm is immediately going to go into ways that were tested whether we're going to live for ourselves or live for others next paragraph someone said how can you stand to let somebody call you such bad names it's a choice you're going to live for yourself or you're going to live for them that's calling you bad names it's a choice you don't live for yourself you live for others why that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons I'm glad that there's Grace to take away that Amnesia aren't you you're a son you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others well brother Branham I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it I'm going to tell you this here brother Brandon was not just preaching us a message he lived this message and he had to live it time and time and time again because every one of us know that hey that's no problem to live for certain people I mean because why I mean it's just it's smooth it's just it's nice it's velvety it's it's just man it's just we're just going up we're going the same direction there's no ruffling there's no but you know what there wouldn't be any character molded and it's through some of these moments of where the greatest Redemption is released I want you to think of this because we all can identify this I can live for this brother we have no doubt you probably I got the list right now brother Sammy right in your workplace in your family come on now every every family not every every family has and I'm just going to say this every family has some dysfunction even the brownings I say that because Christ is the standard we to live for others so even within family it's easy and family to live for some than it is for others yeah now watch this next statement live for that man who hates you amen amen amen live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life and when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things and give them up like the sheep gives its wool and you look on towards Calvary so I want to I just thinking and meditating over the weeks and looking at this and really pronounced here how do you live for a person that hates you and would kill you how do you live well I get up of a morning and I put on my clothes and I brush my teeth and I you know I no no it's more than than breathing and eating and everything is to live it's beyond that because we have to do that so it's beyond the things of our natural when when brother Brahm is talking about it's more than just being a human and breathing but it's living with such freedom from our heart where the love of God is dwelling and it's flowing that we could be a Channel of God's mercy and let me tell you it will take nothing less than the presence of God and divine love to make that manifest to live nothing less than that it will take the presence of God of these whole things there's nowhere that I will get to even where uh even tonight and some other things but I will tell you in the battery of quotes that I have here and dealing with all these things there is one common denominator prayer prayer don't ever underestimate prayer brother random called that one of the greatest weapons that God gave us as the Church of the Living God Hallelujah so it's it's being free in other words free from everything that's come to you so you are not responding under the response that has come to you God I don't want to be a reflection of their hatred I want to let the love of God dissolve that let it be like taking the arrows that love can come forth I tell you what that will take more than Humanity that takes God that's what they've done to him he became the sacrifice for their sin once you think of this he sacrificed himself his rights in order to remain a Living Sacrifice I want you to think about this of sacrificing our own things surrendering in his presence you know it could be I know they always you know he kind of joke around that sometimes the people's biggest nerve is the one that leads the pocketbook but but some of the times you know there's a lot sometimes we can be very good in those areas but yet sacrificing our own things is forfeiting our rights we can have a right and be right in what could be done but we have to measure it is that what God would have me to do is that how that I live now you know tonight I'm not just preaching things to you as to preach it as reading it from a label but the things that I preach I've had to live and live you're not looking at a perfect man tonight but you're looking at one who God has given Grace to you're looking at one that has had to and I believe across this audience tonight that's had to wrestle in moments like this and sometimes I haven't had the opportunity just to sit down but I've had to stand up and face it hello now that is and I don't want any I'm not asking for anything from you like Oh Brother Sam you no no what I'm trying to say to you we're in this together right so you see I don't do I don't look down to oh if you only had it like I had and you oh you ought to know how the pastor have no no no no I have my trials you have your trials God does not want my trials to be your trials neither does he need your trials to be my trials trials are personally is orchestrated out like a paper out of a file cabinet oh this is Samuels this is his trial right God God does not say oh you got the white out this was meant for Carlos but I think it'd be good for Samuel white out no no every trial listen predestinated from the hand of God because you know what God knows what lays inside of us and he knows what he's trying to bring out remember Brethren tells us when he talks about trials he's not the author of confusion a sheep you think of a sheep has rights and he can forfeit its rights which is its wool and if it forfeits those rights think about that woo I've had some nice suits that are made out of wool some fine worst of wool right I've had some nice hunting clothes where there's some wool in it it'll Brothers they use Carhartts right wool socks they'll tell you one layer of wool socks I mean not the kind that say wool but you look and it says blend fakes but if you have a hundred percent wool I remember I I wouldn't wear rubber boots when it went into hunting and I know they may not seem very spiritual but just listen to the point about wool I I went into Cabela some years back and it was probably six seven years ago and I said I you know walking back through the I I get tired of getting my feet wet when I walk through water and stuff and they said well try these rubber boots I said but they're only 800 gram of thinsula they said what kind of socks are you wearing oh you know I wear two or three pairs of socks I said but I want my toes when my toes get cold I'm gone I'm inside I don't nothing can warm them up and then what the lady told me all you need is one pair of a hundred percent wool socks she was right about that that's what I have in my hunting bag when I go hunting I have done 100 in the world because the wool pulls the moisture away it does all of that I say it in this manner so you bring it to me when wool had to be surrendered look at the benefit to you and I look at the benefit that sheep is not benefiting from surrendering its rights but I'm benefiting from it the wool that has been surrendered I'm benefiting from that Matthew 5 38. you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth I know that might be a family thing right an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you and I want you to let me just let me Rook with these scriptures here a minute ah because but I say unto you that you resist not evil now that phrase is where you're not striving against it now let me just work with it here in a minute but whosoever shall Smite be on thy right cheek Square them up right come on now my mother said that don't happen brother Brown tells us explaining the healing of Jairus daughter he said he let somebody call you a hypocrite and he said you want Satan come whisper to your flesh get even with them the flesh Whispers to the spirit get even with him but by the time he gets down there to the soul the soul said Vengeance his mind saith the Lord that's why we were doing starving the white dog it's only feeding the black dog hmm wow but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also now let me just work with this a minute and if any man will sue thee at the law take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not thou away so what is Jesus saying here let's balance this out what's he saying oh they're suing me I just throw my hands up and just give it to him is that what he's saying don't worry I got a quote is that what he's saying they're gonna Sue and take your straw hands up and say glory to God we're going to fulfill it no because the Bible also says don't be slothful in business are you hearing me what is Jesus saying here that we would resist evil in other words don't come under the same vexation that they are coming at you with Let me Give an example God in Simplicity brother Brian stands there when they are rededicating the Tabernacle after that other portion has been uh built onto and brother random makes it clear that he said Satan tried to take it by a fire the Tabernacle then he said there was a man doing work and the man uh made a false claim as though he fell and he broke his foot or whatever and tried to take it away in deceit there's a lot of types spiritually there but I want to stay with this what brother Brandon was dealing with is that the Tabernacle they didn't say well we're just going to give the Tabernacle up you know we were smitten on the right cheek we'll just give him the Tabernacle well it is it's actually saying it's saying don't come under the Same Spirit they are under if somebody crosses over on your property line you've got laws to protect that if somebody does something on your job you've got a union you're a part of come on Church come on then you're not Holier by saying well bless God I'm just going to take it that ain't being holy the scripture is telling us don't come under the same fighting antagonistic vexation of spirit that they're under you can maintain your rights and still be a child of God you want an example Paul was in a Philippian jail he said wait a minute what you've done to me is unlawful to be done to a Roman citizens I know my right in the bargaining contract section 5432 right see this is scriptural this is standing in a balanced way just not under their same influence Matthew 5 43 now notice you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you ah help me Jesus great big help me Jesus is that right notice these are all notice it's Expressions that are counter to what is coming our way love your enemies bless them they curse you you bless them do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you my mama what are we talking about remembering that we're Sons the church has forgot they are Sons we are remembering we are Sons amen think about this in verse 45 why that you might be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh now notice that you might be the children of your father which is in heaven so all of that from verse 44 that you might be the children of your father which is in heaven notice what Jesus is saying is not do all of this and then you'll be children of God that's not what it is we are children of God by the spirit of God bringing that new birth in our life he's talking about the display of our sonship the display of of that placement of that adoption that we might be the children of Our Father which is in heaven in other words we are conducting ourselves in this earth as if we were there already by the time you say what do you mean when you understand that even in the Millennium that there will be those this is all the way through the Old Testament prophets there will be those Michael writes about it Zephaniah Zechariah on and on there will be those brother Brown pulls it up in the adoption series there will be those that will not come up to Worship in the Feast of Tabernacles and during that time of the Millennium as sons of God we will speak out and say because you have not come up you will receive no rain now think about it the Rapture is not going to change Us in that way that kind of character has got to be molded right here right now that it's not a vindictive way of you're not getting no rain it's letting them see the urgency there's no rain because you're leaving out the important part and that is to assemble at the house of worship [Applause] you fail to assemble you get no rain that we might be the children of your father which is in heaven brother Sammy what are you saying boot camp that's where we're in right now Boot Camp Dylan boot camp Hallelujah for he maketh notice for he maketh his son to rise only upon those that are good and he sends Reign upon only those that he likes no he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust so you could look let's watch this you could look at it and say but Lord you're not making a difference I'm good they're evil this is just and this is unjust but notice God himself is not even making a difference in the way that he dispels his light and the moisture you know what he's saying that's the call for you and I come on now say help me Lord let's Let It Drop on down Lord help me not to be a sun regulator I'm going to give son to brother Shane but not brother Dave uh buddy I'm going to give you the darkness [Laughter] I'm going to give you some rain you now I'm not going to give you no rain that's that human sticky part and if you belong to God you won't be able to get by with that you will be miserable matter of fact many scriptures I can point to it will be tormented until you begin to act the right way that's scriptures so in other words it's not up to me or you to decide who gets Sunshine who gets rain it comes out upon all [Applause] so it's not spotty it's selective ground but it's surrendering into the hands of God and I'll tell you that kind of reflection of the Heavenly into the Earthly that requires a different love than human love can you say Amen to that for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so but Jesus is saying you're you're Ohio you know I can live from this brother I can live for this sister Jesus said you ain't no different than the rest of these religious people do the same thing but we ought to be as children of our heavenly father oh I got a right but you forfeit your rights be you therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that that word perfect it means to be under full development and immaturity I tell you I think it's time to throw down the kid games come on church I think it's time to stop acting childish but if I don't get my way or if things don't go my way then I'm gonna act like this it's only display either there's a lack of something there or it's not come to maturity come on when I was a child I dearly doubted with things of a child but when I became a man I put away childish things are you hearing me now now I want you to watch how brother Brown will pray about this and God hiding himself in simplicity powerful statement he said I pray he's praying for the people Lord God I pray you'll bless them I pray that this very night will find the peace of God in each of their hearts that they will be so filled with your spirit that they'll have faith to perform Miracles and the church said Faith to live a Godly life and to live a life so sweet that when we are spoke evil of they speak not back evil that they can return a kiss for a slap now that don't mean you know what a kiss is welcoming welcoming welcoming that they can return good for evil granted Lord make men to be humble make them to come to know you in the power of your resurrection and may your death not be in vain to us in this generation I found that so remarkable let us be so filled with your spirit we all would take the first two parts to perform miracles to live a Godly life thank God for that but to notice the then filling of that spirit is that we might also be able to return good for evil now I don't know about you I I appreciate that my faith can take a hold of this but the times when evil comes I don't like I don't like that I don't I'm not standing up here tonight saying glory to God evil has come my way I hate evil I hate those types of things you hate to be misunderstood you hate those things like that not the people you hate those types of things but thank God for grace that in the midst of it that there is a conquering power that we can give ourselves to so that the evil does not conquer us but rather we conquer it so there's a real Display of Power notice this in First Peter chapter 2 verse 19. for this is think worthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when we be buffeted for it your faults you take it patiently we've all been there right yeah I mean except for everybody all the you know well I don't make no mistakes brother Samuel that's the biggest mistake you made I mean what is that when we make a mistake or we heir to take that patiently that you know there's a part of a growing right there but when you do well and you suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God let me just say this to you God permits everything that comes our way sometimes we are so we can get so perplexed about if this could have been this and this wouldn't have done this and this then this and this and and everything we what we we because you know why we don't like trouble now I'll just say it again if you like trouble you need the Holy Ghost because what you've got is trouble in your soul and you need the Holy Ghost but a real believer does not like trouble at all does not enjoy it does not Delight in it not only in receiving it but never to inflict it upon others either hello but God permits things to come our way sometimes it seems so strange and we can look and say well if this hadn't happened and that happened but God permits things you know we don't understand the things many times that God is working out but any time that God permits something to come our way God is molding Our Lives in Victory notice for even here unto you we were called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps so he's our example watch this who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth so if deceit had been found in his mouth such as deceit guile would be to say something but it'd be different down here so there wasn't any deceit in his mouth remember David said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight so neither was God found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously Allah this whole part this right here of committing himself to him that judgeth righteously you know what he did he took everything that had come against him and the word committed means is to actually deliver oneself into the hands of another so the Lord Jesus actually he was able to deliver himself not just when he Lazarus was raised from the grave not just when he walked on the water but when all of this accusation had come against him he was able to deliver himself into the hand of him that judges righteously now think about it everything all the rest of them did even when he prayed on the cross for forgive him they don't know what they're doing oh you're talking about Victory and love divine who his own self bear our sins in his body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live under righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed for we were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and Bishop of your souls our brother Rand talks about this in the church and its condition how many know in the scripture we read I think last week we read in the scripture in Ephesians 5 where it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed grief not that that comes down upon us grieve not now I want you to think of this grieve not now notice the dove itself brother Brown would put it like this he says now just walk meekly quietly humbly gently and the dove will lead you but whenever you go to listening to that gossip well how do you listen to gossip where you give an ear to it hello but when you go to listening to that gossip whenever you go to getting that temper up whenever you go to thinking you've got a right to do this and that but God just takes her flight and goes on away then you don't have it anymore and yet here she is she's sitting right out there on the limb of Peace waiting for your nature to be changed so no disgrieve not the holy spirit of God so what happens the dove of God just pulls back from her life if as a believer as a believer I'm telling you you recognize when you grieve the spirit of God that's not a mystery you recognize that his presence pulls back from your life that
