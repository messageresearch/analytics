[35:03] as you're turning with me to first Peter
[35:05] chapter 4 we just had just a wonderful
[35:08] time here on Thursday night and I tell
[35:11] you I I knew it was going to be one of
[35:14] those times where you leave out of here
[35:16] and you just time we got out of the
[35:19] parking lot I think it was about 10
[35:20] o'clock and you know not that the
[35:23] service went that long but it's just the
[35:25] amount of things that was spoken and how
[35:30] our hearts were so touched and you know
[35:32] I set back there and
[35:35] it was setting back there in the booth
[35:36] and I thought you know what's so
[35:39] tremendous in this time it's it's an
[35:43] expression of the word itself being
[35:46] lived out and you know it's just as one
[35:50] thing was mentioned you know one one
[35:53] brother had mentioned to me said you
[35:55] know said I when the testimony was given
[35:58] you know concerning brother herb and the
[36:01] rest of them said I didn't even know I
[36:04] didn't even know and I think it's good
[36:06] for us to know and and I just I look at
[36:10] that and I think my you know it's just
[36:12] it's something you see that and you know
[36:15] our our testimonies and the things that
[36:18] we go through
[36:19] amen God brings it for a real testimony
[36:22] and a strength to one another and I
[36:26] believe that with all of my heart I know
[36:29] that to be the truth because I
[36:30] experienced that so let's just look into
[36:34] the word together and verse we're gonna
[36:38] just read a few verses and let you be
[36:40] seated Peter says for as much then as
[36:44] Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh
[36:48] arm yourselves likewise with the same
[36:53] mind for he that hath suffered in the
[36:56] flesh hath ceased from sin that he no
[37:01] longer should live the rest of his time
[37:03] in the flesh to the lust of men but to
[37:08] the will of God I think let's draw our
[37:11] attention back to verse 2 could we just
[37:13] read that together let's read it
[37:15] together that he no longer should live
[37:18] the rest of his time in the flesh to the
[37:21] lust of men but to the will of God amen
[37:26] god bless you as you're being seated
[37:35] we look here in the scripture and as we
[37:40] read here in the first part of the
[37:44] scripture here with Peter and Peter
[37:47] expresses this of how that Christ hath
[37:49] suffered for us in the flesh and Peter
[37:54] is bringing this this part of it of the
[37:57] suffering that a life that has suffered
[38:01] as Christ suffered for us in the flesh
[38:03] is then armed with that same mind that
[38:08] same life and that that is where the
[38:13] very desire resonates from within us to
[38:18] do the will of God you know it's one
[38:21] thing when God as he begins to deal with
[38:24] the life and draw our heart to him
[38:27] because remember we are not drawn to an
[38:32] idea you can never marry an idea it's a
[38:38] person so it's that the person of Jesus
[38:43] Christ that is is drawing us to him and
[38:48] it is submitting and a submission to him
[38:51] and he is the one that's cultivating
[38:55] within our life the desire that is
[38:57] hidden there that only he can raise up
[39:00] and bring to preeminence in our life but
[39:03] the Benham says it like this and the
[39:05] message identification he says you and
[39:08] had a desire to serve Him and that's why
[39:11] he went to Calvary so that that desire
[39:13] could come forth in your life he knew
[39:17] that was there because he placed that in
[39:19] your life and so as he draws us to him
[39:22] then that desire as Paul would speak of
[39:25] it so expressly in Hebrews that the
[39:27] worshiper once purged have no more
[39:29] conscience desire for sin it's when that
[39:32] desire resonates within us to do the
[39:35] will of God and and I will say to you
[39:38] this morning that we certainly need his
[39:42] leadership in his will even when we
[39:45] think and it
[39:47] think it's good that we know where we're
[39:49] hitting on the target but as we looked
[39:51] at it the other night on Thursday that
[39:53] even if we be any otherwise minded in
[39:56] anything he himself will show us so that
[39:59] we're hitting right on the target and
[40:01] I'm grateful for that because when we
[40:04] look at the will of God its living by
[40:06] the word by the life abiding in us and
[40:09] us in it so then the purpose of our life
[40:13] begins to come into view or the secret
[40:16] of our life begins to be unfolded when
[40:19] God takes a hold of our life and this I
[40:21] want you to look in and hone in on this
[40:23] scripture that we read here in verse 2
[40:26] that once a person has suffered has
[40:29] ceased from that of the of the lust of
[40:33] men from cease from that of the world
[40:35] that old nature has died now we are
[40:39] living completely to the will of God
[40:41] that's our desire to serve his purpose
[40:44] and so within this I want to just look
[40:48] here in the scriptures just for a few
[40:50] places here and I'm just gonna move
[40:51] quickly to lay this background in Romans
[40:54] 6 5 and 7 it says for if we have been
[40:57] planted together in the likeness of his
[41:00] death we shall also be in the likeness
[41:03] of his resurrection knowing this how
[41:07] many glad you know this that our old man
[41:10] is crucified with him that the body of
[41:14] sin might be destroyed that hint of the
[41:18] divine love of God that's moving in a
[41:20] life you know you could see the same
[41:22] temple but what you've seen being
[41:25] expressed out of that temple was not the
[41:28] same character that was there because
[41:30] what they knew of Paul you know even
[41:33] when the disciples would you know and in
[41:36] the very beginning you know they were
[41:38] very removed from from Paul what they
[41:42] had known of him but the testimony of
[41:45] Jesus Christ within his life it spoke
[41:48] for itself and Paul would go on to
[41:51] further mention that not just of the
[41:54] disciples but he would speak of that
[41:56] testimony of life that's been lived
[41:59] as that was the entrance or the
[42:01] commendation by which the ministering of
[42:04] the word could go forth and he said
[42:06] those things very clearly even and all
[42:08] through the letters that Paul had wrote
[42:10] by the Spirit of God so we believe it's
[42:13] living a life that truly is an
[42:15] expression of Jesus Christ Galatians
[42:19] 5:24 says they that are Christ's
[42:22] belonging to him have crucified the
[42:27] flesh with the affections and lusts in
[42:31] Galatians 6:14 but God forbid that I
[42:35] should glory save in the cross of our
[42:39] Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is
[42:43] crucified unto me and I unto the world
[42:46] remember what Paul was speaking of when
[42:48] he's speaking of the world he's speaking
[42:51] of that of Cosmos the very origin and
[42:55] bringing forth of this world the system
[42:58] that's upon it he's not just speaking of
[43:00] attributes of sin he's speaking of the
[43:03] world the Bible says in first john loved
[43:07] not the world right and the Bible also
[43:10] tells us when Paul himself was there he
[43:14] said demas hath forsaken me having loved
[43:17] this present world demon Dimas didn't
[43:20] love drinking he didn't love running
[43:21] around Dimas did not go out to
[43:23] nightclubs you know what I'm talking
[43:25] about but it was the concept he's
[43:28] thinking it was not in tune with the
[43:31] light of God with the character with the
[43:34] nature of God Dimas himself could not
[43:36] understand suffering a man in position
[43:41] like this having a ministry like this
[43:43] how and why do you have only one coat
[43:46] and why are you suffering and we won't
[43:49] dwell on that this morning but you see
[43:51] the love of the world is much deeper
[43:53] than just attributes and this and that
[43:56] and this and that it goes down into the
[43:59] very depths the very very very
[44:02] foundations what it's based on now watch
[44:04] this watch out G the Lord Jesus places
[44:07] this in Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and 24
[44:10] and he said unto them
[44:12] if any man will come after me let him
[44:16] deny himself that's the first thing
[44:20] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[44:26] not just once not twice daily so his
[44:31] cross made a way for us to take up our
[44:36] cross without his cross there would be
[44:39] no cross there would be no there would
[44:44] be no way for us to actually become dead
[44:47] to the world
[44:48] the Pharisees all that they themselves
[44:51] could could do they could not die to the
[44:54] world and neither did they see than the
[44:57] necessary a reality of water Redeemer is
[45:01] all about they didn't see that they they
[45:06] did not capture that at all but to think
[45:09] his cross makes a way that you and I can
[45:12] take up his cross our cross daily and
[45:15] follow him how many of you know that
[45:18] following him it's not easy I'm not
[45:21] talking about the desire in our life I'm
[45:23] saying that it's not the easy way the
[45:27] easy way is according to the flesh but
[45:35] for his way it requires us and he'll
[45:39] lead us to where that we are continually
[45:43] it's a crucify and you realize to
[45:46] crucify is a slow death Wow
[45:52] so the new birth makes way that we can
[45:56] continue to die one death that we can
[45:59] continue to die to self by his life
[46:02] reigning within us for what for the
[46:05] purpose of the will of God oh my for
[46:11] whosoever shall save his life shall lose
[46:14] it but whosoever will lose his life for
[46:16] my sake
[46:16] the same shall save it first Peter 5:1
[46:19] here Peter says the elders which are
[46:22] among you I exhort who am also
[46:25] an elder and a witness of the sufferings
[46:28] of Christ and also a partaker of the
[46:33] glory that shall be revealed so Peter is
[46:37] letting a know it's not just all
[46:41] suffering but I am also a partaker I
[46:44] hold within my heart that which has got
[46:47] ahold of me that glory that shall be
[46:49] revealed Peters declaring that Peter was
[46:54] not just a witness here of the
[46:56] sufferings as an onlooker but now Peter
[46:59] had become a participant glory be to God
[47:05] a witness I'm a witness you know a
[47:07] witness you can't be a witness you know
[47:09] you might hurt a car screech and
[47:11] everything else outside of your window
[47:14] but unless you've been there unless you
[47:18] know it it's just something that you're
[47:21] surmising are you with me but if you're
[47:25] there it's different you with me it's
[47:29] different that's why there is no
[47:32] replacement for the new birth by the new
[47:36] birth then we become witnesses of Jesus
[47:40] Christ let me say like this we become
[47:42] true jehovah's witness then all right
[47:50] remember when we're brother brems talks
[47:53] about john sprawls how that you know he
[47:57] and his wife were looking at a statue
[47:59] that was in a garden and it was a statue
[48:02] that what that had been sculpted to
[48:05] portray the sufferings of christ and
[48:07] john Sproul he made mention to brother
[48:10] branham e says you know he and his wife
[48:12] were standing off and they were
[48:13] criticizing that statue it said why
[48:16] didn't they make it like this it doesn't
[48:18] look like there's any sufferings to this
[48:20] statue I mean he was criticizing but
[48:23] then the man who was their curator or
[48:26] whatever he comes over to him and he
[48:28] says sorry says I noticed that you're
[48:31] criticizing this statue he said but you
[48:34] see it wasn't meant to look at it at the
[48:37] angle that your
[48:38] King on it but he says what you need to
[48:41] do is come and kneel down right here and
[48:45] then look up at that statue and then
[48:49] tell me what you see and when he came
[48:51] Jonesboro came to that place and he
[48:54] looks up he says oh my says it just
[48:56] overwhelmed him it began to weep he and
[48:59] his wife he said because he saw at that
[49:02] angle the sufferings of Christ and it
[49:06] had an impact on his life and I want to
[49:10] just say to you this morning that God
[49:14] who is holy who has all knowledge who
[49:18] knows all things new the end from the
[49:20] beginning knew how much tallow that a
[49:22] flea would make knew everything but yet
[49:26] he did not have an understanding of what
[49:31] it was to be man he had a knowledge but
[49:37] he didn't understand it but notice God's
[49:41] way is that he might understand what it
[49:46] was like to be man not just to do this
[49:49] but he himself to really understand
[49:53] think of this now I want you to consider
[49:55] this he could have come and given his
[50:00] life walking right out of the River
[50:02] Jordan there and he could have went and
[50:05] gave his life right then it could have
[50:10] even been that's just saying if if it
[50:12] just was even before that time coming to
[50:14] an age of accountability coming to a
[50:16] place and then how the Spirit of God
[50:18] moving at he could have went and would
[50:21] he not have redeemed us do you
[50:27] understand what I'm saying he wants the
[50:29] perfect Lamb of God do we agree what was
[50:32] needed for redemption it was me and
[50:35] necessary for redemption that there
[50:38] would be a suffering that would be a
[50:40] blood that would be able to bring us
[50:43] back there was not a Sun upon the earth
[50:47] that could do it
[50:49] so God had to get himself a son and then
[50:55] through that son I come in my father's
[50:57] name
[50:57] here he comes bearing the name because
[51:00] there were many other sons and daughters
[51:03] that had lived down through the ages and
[51:06] there were many more that would come
[51:07] that they having the seed of life within
[51:11] them that when his life would come forth
[51:14] out of the blood cell and come upon this
[51:17] seed it would breed bad sons and
[51:20] daughters of God again that was
[51:24] necessary do you dream he could have
[51:28] done that and we would have been
[51:29] redeemed but then when you come to him
[51:33] with certain problems he would say I
[51:36] don't know how I don't know what you're
[51:39] talking about you said you're feeling
[51:43] how how is it you're feeling I don't
[51:46] know I don't know come on Hebrews 4
[51:53] Hebrews 2 5 and 7 it says for unto the
[51:56] Angels hath he not put in subjection the
[51:59] world to come where ever we speak but
[52:01] one in a certain place testified saying
[52:04] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[52:08] how many's glad he's mindful he's
[52:12] mindful he was aware this is what the
[52:15] word mindful means he was aware he never
[52:18] forgot the need of redemption neither
[52:23] has he ever forgotten what you and I
[52:26] what you and I had need of he is mindful
[52:30] I tell you this morning he's still
[52:32] mindful of us he says what is man that
[52:36] thou art mindful of him or the Son of
[52:38] man that thou visitest him that this
[52:42] word visitor has just been a word that I
[52:44] have fallen in love with through the New
[52:45] Testament this word visited remember
[52:48] it's the same word that calls John to
[52:51] say go ask if he's the one or do we ask
[52:53] for another because the Ministry of the
[52:56] Lord Jesus
[52:57] here we find God coming down Emmanuel
[52:59] becoming flesh the very word
[53:01] visited I love this it means to look
[53:04] upon or after to inspect examine with
[53:08] the eyes in order to see how he is to
[53:13] visit don't see one the poor and
[53:15] afflicted the sick to look upon in order
[53:18] to help or to benefit think of the
[53:22] Ministry of the Lord Jesus such I'll
[53:26] tell you this I think we can agree he
[53:28] had the most important job to do
[53:31] that's ever been but watch how he
[53:35] handled his duty the Bible tells us over
[53:39] and over in the scriptures when you look
[53:42] at the compassion of the Lord Jesus it
[53:44] says that he looked upon the multitudes
[53:47] and all that were sick he healed them
[53:50] it Bible goes on to say that he looked
[53:52] upon them and he saw that they were
[53:55] hungry hungry this is a natural
[53:57] attribute hungry you mean God is
[54:00] concerned with somebody me or you
[54:03] that would be hungry jesus was he took
[54:06] notice of it his job did not cause him
[54:09] to look at things and say that's menial
[54:11] that this isn't even important this come
[54:14] on now he didn't ignore us he never
[54:18] ignored the need but what am I talking
[54:20] about the God of glory the greatest he
[54:24] that is holy did not look over he was
[54:26] not even with this purpose you know how
[54:29] it is sometimes in our life we get so
[54:31] wrapped up in us that we don't have time
[54:35] to consider anybody else or anything
[54:37] else it sauce well if you had to do what
[54:40] I did if you did this if you did that if
[54:43] you did this if you did that but all
[54:45] look at the Lord Jesus the most
[54:46] important important purpose that could
[54:50] have never been but the Bible says he
[54:52] took notice and he says their multitude
[54:55] we cannot send them away hungry he said
[55:00] we must feed them what do we have here
[55:06] I'm glad he's mindful I'm glad that he's
[55:10] mindful and doesn't look at our needs
[55:11] and say come on dear in the revealed
[55:13] word of the hour but it's the revealed
[55:16] word of the hour that makes me know that
[55:18] the eyes of God are present and he knows
[55:21] my every need and man it is Christ
[55:25] Himself being revealed now think of this
[55:29] let's look at the depth of this
[55:31] visitation for a few moments and Isaiah
[55:34] 53 verse 1 familiar passage of reading
[55:38] but notice let us let the Spirit of God
[55:41] so impress it upon our hearts this
[55:43] morning who hath believed our report and
[55:46] to whom is the arm or the strength of
[55:49] the Lord revealed now think of it the
[55:53] way that the world has portrayed
[55:55] strength it's Superman all these great
[56:02] heroes their main heroes that's the only
[56:08] figures that are meant to be idolized
[56:10] that's not a real hero a real hero is
[56:15] one that can come to the lowest point
[56:17] and yet within it all stand true and
[56:21] stand faithful there's only one who ever
[56:24] homei neither one of them might have
[56:26] been you know as they portrayed the
[56:28] different things to where they can be
[56:29] beat to a pulp and everything else and
[56:32] here they come back and gain strength
[56:33] but I'll tell you there's not one that
[56:36] could ever die and raise up again but I
[56:38] Lord Jesus he revealed himself to us and
[56:42] said I am he that was dead and ever live
[56:45] forevermore I have the keys of death
[56:48] hell and the grave
[56:49] I have Poprad Satan's Trinity I'm glad
[56:54] for that revelation but notice this
[56:56] depth of visitation of our Lord for he
[57:01] shall grow up before him has a tender
[57:04] plant he knows what the teenage years
[57:08] are like
[57:14] yeah the Prophet said he knows what it's
[57:17] like to be a teenager I know different
[57:22] things come it's true there's things
[57:24] that right now that teenagers face that
[57:26] as far as things that they face it's
[57:28] different than even what I faced and I'm
[57:31] only a few years older than most of them
[57:35] some of you get that but what it comes
[57:39] down to listen to me now the temptations
[57:42] themselves do not come through all other
[57:44] kinds of gates there's still only three
[57:46] gates lust of flesh lust of eye pride of
[57:49] life those three gates are still the
[57:52] same avenues that he comes and uses all
[57:55] types of different devices and other
[57:57] things true but yet he himself shall
[57:59] grow up before him as a tender plant and
[58:02] as a root out of dry ground watch this
[58:05] he have no form nor comeliness he did
[58:11] not come in kingly decor kingly decor
[58:16] would have been that which was just on
[58:18] the outside but remember there is a
[58:20] woman that sets in the Book of
[58:22] Revelations that looks right on the
[58:24] outside she's clothed right on the
[58:27] outside but on the inside when he opens
[58:30] at all she's full o see satan's
[58:37] objective is to beautify the outside he
[58:43] even pulled that over on the Pharisees
[58:45] remember now to think of this he hath no
[58:48] form nor comeliness and when we shall
[58:52] see him there is no beauty that we
[58:57] should desire him Jesus listen there's
[59:02] other places in the scripture that we
[59:04] could pull Absalon saw and the rest of
[59:06] them that the scriptures are detailed to
[59:08] let us know these men were of a handsome
[59:11] character they had a comely comeliness
[59:15] about them in their natural countenance
[59:19] Jesus did not have that probably be the
[59:23] God I could identify with that then
[59:26] there was no beauty sometimes you wonder
[59:31] well as my nose this way one of my ears
[59:33] this way and why not listen God knows
[59:35] exactly he knew even the color of your
[59:38] eyes the color of your hair
[59:41] there was no beauty so when you feel
[59:45] that you're ugly you can look right here
[59:47] in the scripture he himself there was no
[59:50] beauty let me just put it simple Jesus
[59:54] would have never made GQ magazine come
[59:57] on now he would have never run the local
[1:00:00] beauty pageant but you see it wasn't
[1:00:03] outward beauty it was an inward beauty
[1:00:06] oh my oh how we can draw strength from
[1:00:13] this this morning the Bible says he is
[1:00:17] despised and rejected of men he was in
[1:00:21] Isaiah's generation he was a nois he is
[1:00:23] despised and rejected of men a man of
[1:00:28] sorrows this was not the last few
[1:00:33] moments of the cross that's not what
[1:00:35] this is this was his life notes passed
[1:00:40] at school
[1:00:41] that's a drunken soldier sad you know
[1:00:46] his mama she's a man of sorrows
[1:00:52] acquainted with grief you say brother
[1:00:56] Sammy how do you know that they were
[1:00:57] saying it well I'll tell you this right
[1:00:58] here they're the people who standing in
[1:01:01] the pulpits were saying it and calling
[1:01:02] him Beelzebub and all those things like
[1:01:04] that what makes you think that the
[1:01:06] children wasn't doing that because the
[1:01:08] homes would have been doing it and
[1:01:10] everything else what they did not know
[1:01:11] God's program you say that wasn't
[1:01:15] necessary oh yes it is necessary a man
[1:01:18] of sorrows did he have to come exactly
[1:01:22] this way yes and no he could have
[1:01:28] redeemed us without being acquainted
[1:01:30] with any of these things right but
[1:01:36] he's in order to be a faithful and
[1:01:39] merciful hot wrist a man of sorrows
[1:01:47] acquainted with grief sickness sadness
[1:01:53] anybody gets that he got sad said he got
[1:02:00] sick hmm
[1:02:03] yet we did esteem him watch this now
[1:02:06] when let me go on and we hid as it were
[1:02:08] our faces from him he was despised and
[1:02:12] we esteemed him not
[1:02:17] Jesus never fit in are you with me he
[1:02:24] was not the one who would have been
[1:02:26] picked for the kickball team he was not
[1:02:31] the one that any of them would have
[1:02:33] picked that he was despised they hated
[1:02:36] him come on somebody it was not a bed of
[1:02:41] roses why because this walk the Lord
[1:02:44] Jesus spent more time talking to you and
[1:02:47] I about our cross the persecution the
[1:02:50] suffering that would take place in our
[1:02:52] life on his behalf and would let you and
[1:02:55] I know why that when he himself would be
[1:02:59] able to stand there as the great High
[1:03:01] Priest and intercede for you and I and
[1:03:03] minister on our behalf this was not an
[1:03:08] act this was not an act this was not a
[1:03:13] precedent going down and putting on a
[1:03:16] hardhat and walking through this steel
[1:03:18] mill that is not the life of the Lord
[1:03:20] Jesus the life of the Lord Jesus if I
[1:03:23] can say it in this way is one who not
[1:03:25] only put on the steel hat but made in
[1:03:28] the likeness of sinful flesh he actually
[1:03:31] knows what it's like to work those 12
[1:03:33] hours he knows what it's like to be
[1:03:36] hungry he knows what it's like not to
[1:03:38] have a place to lay his head you see
[1:03:44] some of these things you and I could
[1:03:47] look at and say well you know that would
[1:03:49] be very simple
[1:03:49] Jesus would have been more economically
[1:03:51] minded you know Jesus would have taken
[1:03:53] out the Excel spreadsheet and Jesus
[1:03:54] would have paid the pie chart and he
[1:03:56] would have calculated his expenses so he
[1:04:03] would have been the high priest of Excel
[1:04:06] is that what you're telling me but you
[1:04:09] see this is where Paul could pick up
[1:04:11] from the Old Testament and Paul could
[1:04:13] even say in the book of Thessalonians we
[1:04:16] will have the poor always there's needs
[1:04:19] once they're not needs that were needs
[1:04:21] in Jerusalem the Corinthian church took
[1:04:24] up and sent to the needs in Jerusalem
[1:04:26] there were needs in other places there
[1:04:29] it wasn't because they were serving God
[1:04:31] that they all of a sudden became just
[1:04:34] profitable and everything financial was
[1:04:37] just right as a matter of fact our
[1:04:42] prophet told us there are more 10 years
[1:04:46] than millionaires people who lust and
[1:04:50] desire and think that more gain will
[1:04:53] bring them more happiness it doesn't
[1:04:54] it'll just bring you more responsibility
[1:04:57] it'll tie you up more cause you got to
[1:04:59] keep up with what you have look at this
[1:05:03] here surely he hath borne oh I'm glad
[1:05:08] about that he hath borne our griefs and
[1:05:11] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:05:16] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:05:18] afflicted let's look at this as the
[1:05:21] brother Brad picks us up in the Hebrew
[1:05:23] series he said that's the reason that
[1:05:25] Christ God had to become kinfolks to us
[1:05:28] he come down and was a man he suffered
[1:05:32] temptation he was laughed at made fun of
[1:05:36] and persecuted and what's it say ignored
[1:05:43] you mean they're suffering you know
[1:05:46] Jesus you mean to tell me he had to
[1:05:48] actually suffer being ignored I won't
[1:05:53] ask you to raise your hands but how many
[1:05:54] of you felt ignored
[1:05:59] you mean our high priest would be so
[1:06:03] subjected to where he would experience
[1:06:07] being ignored why because his children
[1:06:12] are ignored
[1:06:14] sometimes God forgive us we ignore one
[1:06:16] another we ignore the needs we just pass
[1:06:20] right on by ignore the needs of one
[1:06:22] another God forgive us and help us he
[1:06:26] was laughed at made fun of and
[1:06:29] persecuted and ignored and called
[1:06:32] Beelzebub and scoffed at and suffered
[1:06:36] death under capital punishment he had to
[1:06:39] be kinfolks to us look at this statement
[1:06:42] he had to be falsely accused anybody
[1:06:46] like to be falsely accused know what the
[1:06:49] what's the tendency out of our life is
[1:06:51] to prove our point that's the tendency
[1:06:55] when you're falsely accused you're
[1:06:58] attended to come out and prove your
[1:07:00] point he had to be falsely accused
[1:07:06] because why you're falsely accused so he
[1:07:15] had to be why did he have to be because
[1:07:17] of you because of me he had to
[1:07:20] experience that of what it's like to be
[1:07:23] accused of something that is not the
[1:07:26] truth how many times you find Jesus in
[1:07:29] the temple when he's accused where he
[1:07:31] stands there and debates with him where
[1:07:33] he will do all that he doesn't the Bible
[1:07:35] says he slipped out of their midst the
[1:07:37] Bible says when they pressed upon him
[1:07:38] vehemently with questions he dodged and
[1:07:44] moved out of the event this is why the
[1:07:45] inspiration can strike Paul to tell
[1:07:48] Timothy do not entangle yourself with
[1:07:51] foolish questions do not get into
[1:07:54] endless genealogy do not waste one
[1:07:58] moment of your time with foolishness
[1:08:02] why false accusations is where it must
[1:08:07] be committed to God right
[1:08:11] the Bible says in the book of Peter he
[1:08:13] committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:08:16] righteously he had to bear sickness
[1:08:23] because you're sick he had to bear sins
[1:08:28] because it was your sins he had to
[1:08:32] become kinfolk the only way he could
[1:08:35] redeem us was to become kinfolks to us
[1:08:37] and how could he become kinfolks he is
[1:08:39] by taking on the form of sinful flesh
[1:08:42] and becoming one of us and in that he
[1:08:44] paid the price and redeemed us back into
[1:08:47] the fellowship of the Father
[1:08:48] all water Savior words couldn't express
[1:08:52] it now think of this in the Simonian
[1:08:57] church age brother Branham is dealing
[1:08:59] with this and we started in a little bit
[1:09:01] on this last week on the purpose that
[1:09:03] trials themselves are not just erratic
[1:09:07] happenings that just fall out of the air
[1:09:10] trials themselves are predestined
[1:09:13] appointments by God that actually were
[1:09:16] to shape and mold us for the perfecting
[1:09:19] of the will that he has for our lives
[1:09:22] hello my god help us to just submit to
[1:09:26] it
[1:09:26] Amen can you say amen to that God helped
[1:09:29] me to submit to it and even when it's
[1:09:32] things that that is not a trial but
[1:09:34] simply a bad decision that I have made
[1:09:37] help me Lord to be submissive and to
[1:09:41] learn from my bad decisions teach me
[1:09:45] Lord blue bream says his purpose is that
[1:09:48] after we have suffered a while we would
[1:09:51] be made perfect be established
[1:09:54] strengthened and settled has job said he
[1:09:57] puts strength in us you see he himself
[1:10:02] suffered he learned obedience by the
[1:10:06] things that he suffered he was actually
[1:10:09] made perfect by the things that he
[1:10:13] suffered Hebrews 5:8 through nine though
[1:10:17] he were a son yet learned
[1:10:22] well if you already know it why do you
[1:10:24] gotta learn it learning it is coming to
[1:10:29] understand not just know it understand
[1:10:35] it there's a lot of things that you and
[1:10:37] I can know as far as within terms and
[1:10:40] things that happens and maybe it's a
[1:10:41] disease maybe it's something that's
[1:10:43] spoken here we can know it that all that
[1:10:46] that must be a terrible thing but when
[1:10:49] you actually have went through something
[1:10:51] that's similar all that's different
[1:10:54] there's understanding then that goes out
[1:10:57] not saying that we can't pray for
[1:11:00] somebody and really have empathy for
[1:11:02] them but when we ourselves have actually
[1:11:04] went through something like that it's
[1:11:06] not just empathy but now it's sympathy
[1:11:09] were able to enter in having the same
[1:11:14] feeling but he by the things look at
[1:11:18] this though he were a son yet he learned
[1:11:22] by the things which he suffered and
[1:11:24] being made perfect he became the author
[1:11:28] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:11:32] obey Him in plain language a miracle in
[1:11:36] language the very character of Jesus was
[1:11:41] perfected by suffering now look at him
[1:11:47] and look at us we are made perfect in
[1:11:52] our soul by that blood offering and the
[1:11:56] new birth brings us into that are you
[1:11:59] with me we are made perfect but he comes
[1:12:04] by the ministering of his word he comes
[1:12:07] through carried through trials and tests
[1:12:09] to do what for the perfecting of the
[1:12:12] Saints it's not about ourselves no
[1:12:17] that's not what it's about
[1:12:18] it's about our character being perfected
[1:12:22] this is why over and over in the message
[1:12:25] identification each time the prophet
[1:12:27] would speak of it he would let us know
[1:12:28] we are invited to have our character
[1:12:33] notice molded it's not a gift molded to
[1:12:38] his own glorious character the gospel
[1:12:42] sends out the invitation the new birth
[1:12:45] ours itself brings us into the body for
[1:12:50] the potter's house where the molding
[1:12:53] takes place remember we are ordained
[1:12:59] predestinated to be conformed to his
[1:13:02] image I want you to think of all of our
[1:13:05] different makeups and how that were a
[1:13:08] mess in all of our makeups but yet God
[1:13:13] Himself would so work through all of our
[1:13:15] makeups all the complexes over hurts all
[1:13:18] dispose of life and yet his life on the
[1:13:21] inside is it will actually an is
[1:13:25] triumphing in our life by subdue our own
[1:13:30] character to his will he's manifesting
[1:13:35] his victory in our life you see things
[1:13:39] become as we walk on with God things
[1:13:42] become more apparent to us it becomes
[1:13:44] more sensitive we become more aware of
[1:13:48] that thing around our lives that's the
[1:13:51] worst thing that anybody could have but
[1:13:53] it came because of the first birth and
[1:13:54] that's pride in plain language the very
[1:13:59] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:14:04] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:14:09] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:14:11] that they to by their faith in God while
[1:14:15] suffering for him would come to a place
[1:14:19] of perfection no suffer no rain no
[1:14:26] suffering no perfection every one of us
[1:14:31] are desiring to be come into perfection
[1:14:35] as a rock we want to see the virtues
[1:14:39] continue to come into maturity in our
[1:14:42] lives
[1:14:43] stature of a perfect man but every one
[1:14:49] of those virtues do not come easy but
[1:14:53] thanks be to God when you're planted by
[1:14:54] the rivers of living water hallelujah
[1:14:59] scornful scorns all around you but you
[1:15:02] have a resource to draw from are you
[1:15:05] with me the streams of grace have made
[1:15:08] its way to the foundation in your life
[1:15:12] how does though how does that come out
[1:15:14] how do those virtues come out they come
[1:15:16] out through trials through hardships
[1:15:21] it's what brings this character of
[1:15:24] Christ forth you see it been nothing for
[1:15:29] a person to be patient with the things
[1:15:30] of the world but suffering for the cause
[1:15:34] of Christ that's a different story
[1:15:38] you've got to see the value have to know
[1:15:42] and have that love of God of the person
[1:15:45] of Jesus Christ hello brother Ram so why
[1:15:50] did he want this James in Chapter 1 to
[1:15:53] Thor for my brother encountered all joy
[1:15:55] when you fall into divers temptations
[1:15:57] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:16:01] faith look what he says knowing this
[1:16:05] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:16:10] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:16:16] have her perfect work that you may be
[1:16:19] perfect and entire wanting nothing I
[1:16:25] won't ask you to raise your hand but how
[1:16:29] many of you prayed for healing and
[1:16:30] you're still waiting how many of you've
[1:16:35] prayed sometimes you've went to doctors
[1:16:37] you've taken this medication you've
[1:16:40] taken this medication and you're still
[1:16:42] suffering here's a Nicole she doesn't
[1:16:45] care we're going to put the devil on
[1:16:48] notice right now
[1:16:50] we're going to back him up off of the
[1:16:52] shoulder to where he likes to take
[1:16:54] quotes and whisper things and say if you
[1:16:56] really had the faith Jesus had perfect
[1:17:00] faith and he experienced sickness booooo
[1:17:05] death come on somebody it's
[1:17:09] understanding your domain if he did
[1:17:12] everything for you the very moment that
[1:17:15] you asked for it we would not become
[1:17:18] matured sons and daughters of God we
[1:17:20] would become spoiled brats and God don't
[1:17:25] want spoiled brats so he knows how to
[1:17:29] perfect you and I aren't you glad for
[1:17:32] that because after all we're gonna rule
[1:17:36] and reign with him do you realize when
[1:17:39] we rule and reign you say I have a
[1:17:40] change your body but you will take with
[1:17:43] you the experiences the molding of that
[1:17:47] character so fits you and I to move into
[1:17:50] that place of the overcomers throne to
[1:17:53] where even in the Millennium where we
[1:17:55] and ourselves will rule and reign as
[1:17:57] sons of God it is befitting to us now
[1:18:02] not just for that moment but for this
[1:18:05] time also so this perfection this word
[1:18:11] perfection means coming to a completion
[1:18:13] full understanding his sonship didn't
[1:18:18] exempt him from suffering but rather is
[1:18:23] quite the contrary think of the story in
[1:18:28] choosing of a bride that brother Branham
[1:18:30] will tell and he that story is also
[1:18:32] there's inner parts that's inter woven
[1:18:33] and injected clear down in the early 50s
[1:18:36] but brother and we'll talk about
[1:18:38] remember that that family they owned a
[1:18:41] certain I think textile mill and then
[1:18:43] this family owns something and they you
[1:18:46] know got it together that this boy and
[1:18:48] this girl were gonna they were going to
[1:18:49] get married they had it made they didn't
[1:18:55] have to work for nothing brother BAM
[1:18:58] even begins to describe you know the
[1:18:59] faucets and the doorknobs and everything
[1:19:01] how it was and they
[1:19:03] sat around and brother van put it like
[1:19:06] this when he snuck up on the house one
[1:19:08] was in this corner one was in that
[1:19:10] corner I know they might have said the
[1:19:14] valise in sickness in health in the good
[1:19:18] times and the bad times but that's all
[1:19:20] they did all they did was save the house
[1:19:24] but in a union there'll be times of
[1:19:27] disappointments let's just be honest
[1:19:29] here there's times we've wanted our
[1:19:31] prayers answered there's things in our
[1:19:32] lives we thought Lord you've just gotta
[1:19:34] answer it right now if you don't Lord I
[1:19:36] had no way I'll be able to go through
[1:19:38] with this Lord every one of us have been
[1:19:43] there and he didn't and you look at it
[1:19:48] and say how am I going to do this how am
[1:19:53] I going to go through this but you'll
[1:19:56] find if you can just think of his
[1:20:00] faithfulness how would you know that
[1:20:03] he's faithful if there were not
[1:20:05] experiences for him to prove it well
[1:20:10] brother saying I know it by his work but
[1:20:11] he said love not in word only but in
[1:20:16] deed what he asks of you and I in the
[1:20:19] expression of love he is God is sending
[1:20:28] there Jesus three times prayed if it's
[1:20:34] possible let me put it in the words that
[1:20:38] the Prophet uses in souls in prison now
[1:20:41] this is the cliffnotes Jesus even prayed
[1:20:47] to dodge the cross it would have been an
[1:20:54] easier way hope you understand
[1:21:00] taking a Roman spear to his heart would
[1:21:04] have been easier than the crucifixion
[1:21:06] steel would have been hard taking a
[1:21:10] bullet would have been hard but the
[1:21:12] crucifixion
[1:21:15] nothing was instant about it and nothing
[1:21:21] is instant with our crucifixion
[1:21:27] character is not a pouch of cocoa that
[1:21:31] you warm up hot water or hot milk and
[1:21:33] then pour it in there and it has the
[1:21:36] marshmallows to garnish it and you mix
[1:21:38] it up and voila we have character no no
[1:21:47] it's a victory it was made complete
[1:21:55] through experience and obedience through
[1:21:58] suffering look at this in Hebrews 2
[1:22:00] verse 9 but we see Jesus who was made a
[1:22:04] little lower than the Angels for the
[1:22:08] suffering of death the suffering of
[1:22:14] death this is not just the cross every
[1:22:19] day in his life there was a suffering of
[1:22:22] death death to will even to where he
[1:22:28] stood before those men in that day and
[1:22:30] they said yeah you seen Abraham why
[1:22:33] you're not moral you're not more than 50
[1:22:35] years old he experienced death in that
[1:22:44] virgin born body reminded the Virgin
[1:22:48] bored body was not a glorified body it
[1:22:52] was not a glorified body if it would
[1:22:56] have been glorified there would have
[1:22:57] been no temptation James chapter 1 let a
[1:23:02] man not say when he's tempted that he's
[1:23:04] tempted of God for God cannot be tempted
[1:23:08] Jesus was tempted so there's a part of
[1:23:13] him that was caught that wasn't inted
[1:23:15] and there's a part of him that was
[1:23:18] tempted that part was not God but veiled
[1:23:22] great is the mystery of godliness we see
[1:23:30] Jesus who was made a little lower than
[1:23:33] the Angels for the suffering of death
[1:23:36] crowned with glory and honor but all
[1:23:39] once again right after that comma
[1:23:41] brother joy there's a whole lot that
[1:23:43] took place before the end before the
[1:23:46] crown with glory that's a whole lot that
[1:23:48] was taken place a life that was left a
[1:23:52] character that was hoarded but look look
[1:23:58] at the outcome he's crowned with glory
[1:24:00] and honor and look at you and me one day
[1:24:05] we clown crowned with glory and honor oh
[1:24:08] yeah we receive a crown of life a new
[1:24:10] body and then we can say surely the
[1:24:16] sufferings of this present time seem as
[1:24:19] nothing as compared when we get to the
[1:24:22] end of the way go to be to God oh ma
[1:24:31] that he by the grace of God
[1:24:36] this was God's grace provided for us
[1:24:40] that he should taste death for every man
[1:24:44] he tasted it he experienced it but he
[1:24:50] subdued it he said I've tasted it for
[1:24:54] you and I stand triumphant over you you
[1:24:58] never have to be separated you'll never
[1:25:01] have to be departed from the presence
[1:25:03] I'll never leave you nor forsake you he
[1:25:09] knows what it is to be forsaken and he
[1:25:13] said I'll never leave you I'll tell you
[1:25:16] when you feel lonely Oh Simon you feel
[1:25:19] lonely Oh sometimes I do hope others
[1:25:21] Samuel do do we sometimes alone yes but
[1:25:24] then if you could just look at him and
[1:25:27] brother bantam says it like this he says
[1:25:29] when I get to feeling in my times of the
[1:25:31] hardest trials he said I faint back to
[1:25:35] Calvary sealed
[1:25:36] on Golgotha and I'll think of his
[1:25:38] suffering I think of what he went
[1:25:40] through he said and then about that time
[1:25:42] he said I just turn and say thank you
[1:25:45] Lord he said see that helps me in my
[1:25:49] trial
[1:25:51] thank back to what he provided for you
[1:25:54] and I that'll give you a victory gives
[1:25:58] us victory over discouragement let me
[1:26:02] find a place to get off here for it
[1:26:05] became him for whom are all things and
[1:26:09] by whom are all things in bringing many
[1:26:13] sons unto glory to make the captain of
[1:26:17] their salvation perfect through
[1:26:22] sufferings plural plural sufferings
[1:26:36] headache sickness rejected despised made
[1:26:43] fun of ignored put down ridiculed
[1:26:51] depressed or you say Jesus wasn't
[1:26:54] depressed huh huh in the Bible in the
[1:26:59] Gospels where it speaks of him in the
[1:27:01] garden it says this man he was of sorrow
[1:27:03] that Bible word means it is the apex of
[1:27:07] what one feels in depression he felt it
[1:27:15] what it was like for who for you that's
[1:27:25] why
[1:27:26] that's why that's why that's why that's
[1:27:29] why oh no think of this here let me just
[1:27:34] try to have mom I'm skip would you I
[1:27:38] don't know if heard the slides up skip
[1:27:40] skip down there to Hebrews to 16 and 18
[1:27:44] would just skip just a little bit and
[1:27:46] work I'll just come down here for verily
[1:27:51] he took not on him the nature of angels
[1:27:55] but he took on him the seed of Abraham
[1:28:00] wherefore in all things that behoove him
[1:28:02] to be made like unto his brethren that
[1:28:06] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:28:11] priest in things pertaining to God to
[1:28:16] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:28:19] people for him that he himself hath
[1:28:22] suffered being tempted he is able like
[1:28:29] that can you say that with me he is able
[1:28:33] let's say it again he is able to secure
[1:28:38] them that are tempted but the Bible says
[1:28:42] secure means to sympathize the reason he
[1:28:48] become this is that he might be
[1:28:50] sympathetic with you now you and I maybe
[1:28:57] maybe you didn't have sympathetic
[1:28:58] parents you didn't have a sympathetic
[1:29:00] teacher you didn't have anybody who ever
[1:29:03] showed sympathy it's hard to relate to
[1:29:05] this because we're talking about sublime
[1:29:09] perfection be holy even as he is holy
[1:29:14] but he became and so subjected himself
[1:29:19] to be tempted that he would be able to
[1:29:26] sympathize with us that he might be
[1:29:31] sympathetic with you
[1:29:34] have your ups and downs and your ins and
[1:29:38] outs and your temptations get so great
[1:29:42] you can't hardly stand it how many say
[1:29:46] lord help me be patient lord help me be
[1:29:51] more patient you know what our
[1:29:54] impatience is sometimes we get to
[1:29:56] expecting more of one another but all
[1:29:58] God forbid anybody expect more out of us
[1:30:01] we get disappointed when we have certain
[1:30:04] expectations but remember whatever
[1:30:07] expectations you can measure out
[1:30:09] somebody can put expectations back on
[1:30:11] you but just remember we are a body and
[1:30:15] we are not ordained to be formed to one
[1:30:17] another's image we are to be formed to
[1:30:20] the image of Jesus Christ I know
[1:30:26] sometimes we take the word and this is
[1:30:29] the standard of the word but you see
[1:30:31] always the thing that you have to look
[1:30:33] for is what is it that's motivating how
[1:30:35] do you feel in there if I took your
[1:30:37] blood pressure under that time what is
[1:30:39] that so if there is a lacking and I
[1:30:45] guess what you have to do and I have to
[1:30:47] do is get the priestly garments on and
[1:30:49] go to interceding for brother so-and-so
[1:30:52] and sister sewing so we got a visit them
[1:30:57] seek to help to benefit what is man that
[1:31:02] thou art mindful of him or the Son of
[1:31:05] man that thou did it visit it and you
[1:31:12] know what as a high priest you can't
[1:31:16] accuse a brother or sister before
[1:31:17] throwing God's throne can do it you
[1:31:22] can't do it it's not allowed can't come
[1:31:28] from your heart Lord you know everybody
[1:31:33] else living at sin and I'm livid right
[1:31:35] Lord your outside even looking at the
[1:31:41] gate you're not even in the outer court
[1:31:43] when you're praying
[1:31:46] because you've got to see surely there's
[1:31:48] an interest surely to goodness the same
[1:31:51] God working on your life and working on
[1:31:54] my life surely to goodness he's got his
[1:31:56] hands full with my life and your life
[1:31:59] and through those experiences in our
[1:32:02] life what does it do it molds us to be
[1:32:06] able to sympathize sympathize in the
[1:32:11] medical profession when I begin to study
[1:32:13] some of these words sympathize and
[1:32:14] empathy you know you've had some of
[1:32:16] you've had nurses and doctors and
[1:32:18] whatever more they come in everything is
[1:32:20] strictly clinical and what's blood
[1:32:22] pressure okay okay I feel okay you tried
[1:32:25] this okay that'll be $50 and did it it
[1:32:29] it in on out the door but then you have
[1:32:31] somebody who spends time with you how
[1:32:33] you feeling oh my have you tried to
[1:32:36] certain things what types of things have
[1:32:38] you tried for this well there's Sam you
[1:32:41] know I'm not there for a social visit so
[1:32:43] do you want somebody who cares or do you
[1:32:47] just want to give fifty dollars to
[1:32:48] somebody who don't care you see they
[1:32:52] spend it the one thing that stood out
[1:32:54] that in all this research of journals
[1:32:56] and documentaries is how that they find
[1:32:59] that in the practice of medicine there
[1:33:01] is a loss of sympathy and empathy and
[1:33:04] let me bring it up today I think God we
[1:33:06] need it I think we need a good dose of
[1:33:08] sympathy and empathy I think we do you
[1:33:14] see this world and the way things are so
[1:33:16] set up it becomes so divided but
[1:33:17] remember to let us remember the very
[1:33:19] character and mind and life of the Lord
[1:33:22] Jesus Christ he wasn't too busy to look
[1:33:27] upon the needs of others but to
[1:33:29] sympathize and to have empathy this is
[1:33:32] what they said it does not mean that you
[1:33:37] all of a sudden that somehow you feel
[1:33:39] sorry for the patient it means that
[1:33:42] you're able to enter in be able to help
[1:33:47] go along with their feelings to help
[1:33:49] them through the process well
[1:33:55] I'm grad glad the Great Physician knows
[1:33:57] that aren't you I'm glad he knows that
[1:34:01] and where we might al act within our
[1:34:03] molding he makes up for it by his life
[1:34:06] being inside of us let me finish this
[1:34:09] he knows look at this he knows how to
[1:34:12] simplifies with you
[1:34:15] he sets there to make intercession he
[1:34:17] sets there to love you and though you go
[1:34:20] astray he won't forsake you he will
[1:34:25] still come after you and not at your
[1:34:28] heart there's not a backslider in the
[1:34:31] building but what know that God knocks
[1:34:33] at his heart daily and he will do it as
[1:34:36] long as you're mortal on this earth for
[1:34:38] he's loved you
[1:34:40] he's redeemed you now I could understand
[1:34:50] him being this way if I was perfectly
[1:34:54] faithful or you were perfectly faithful
[1:34:57] but you see when the new birth has come
[1:35:02] this man on the inside is perfect he's
[1:35:06] perfectly faithful but the character the
[1:35:12] part that's being molded it needs help
[1:35:16] and he doesn't say you mean to tell me
[1:35:21] you think I'm gonna spend my time and
[1:35:23] you've been so sweet no he don't even
[1:35:27] take that attitude aren't you glad
[1:35:30] because he could have done that for
[1:35:32] every one of us don't you love him let's
[1:35:37] just let's just close right here I'm
[1:35:41] glad for the sufferings aren't you
[1:35:42] I'm so glad thank God for the sufferings
[1:35:46] of Christ let's just pause here this
[1:35:50] morning
[1:35:56] or Jesus there's no way Lord that words
[1:36:05] can never capture it can ever be able to
[1:36:09] fully express it but a songwriter moved
[1:36:16] by inspiration would pin the words what
[1:36:22] condom sent you bringing us Redemption
[1:36:29] Lord from our hearts this morning we see
[1:36:33] Lord I know we don't perhaps see it the
[1:36:36] way we ought to but I I pray that God
[1:36:38] that you would continue to break it to
[1:36:41] our hearts throughout this day
[1:36:44] throughout the oncoming days opening it
[1:36:48] to our lives or the depth of this
[1:36:51] visitation helping us Lord to see and
[1:36:58] not just to see it with our mind our
[1:37:01] eyes the father from our heart because
[1:37:07] every one of us throughout Lord
[1:37:10] we've been at different points and some
[1:37:15] points we'll go through again but we
[1:37:19] realize that every trial it's becoming
[1:37:23] more clear every trial its ordained by
[1:37:29] you sometimes the Lord when things as we
[1:37:33] mentioned that sickness in our body
[1:37:36] sometimes the Lord even of things maybe
[1:37:38] we've experienced sometimes it can be
[1:37:40] maybe a reoccurring something in our
[1:37:43] lives like Paul for example he sought
[1:37:47] you three times and you told Paul my
[1:37:51] grace is sufficient
[1:37:53] his eyesight would come and go I wonder
[1:37:58] Lord I look at it Lord sometimes through
[1:38:01] things that I've been through things
[1:38:04] that others the Lord maybe have more
[1:38:05] pondered the same questions
[1:38:07] I don't believe for Paul but it was Oh
[1:38:14] it'll be three days and boy after three
[1:38:17] days it's gonna be gone sometimes it
[1:38:22] might have lasted for a week then Paul
[1:38:28] what if Paul liked us we could have the
[1:38:30] expectation I've had this pain before
[1:38:32] that is this discomfort my body
[1:38:34] I usually last about a week and somebody
[1:38:39] asks just two weeks later is I still
[1:38:41] there
[1:38:45] it shows what our expectation is not on
[1:38:49] a time limit but it's in you Lord we
[1:38:56] never know we don't know sometimes the
[1:38:58] length of time the scriptures say a
[1:39:00] season regarding the trial sometimes it
[1:39:02] says for a while or the things that you
[1:39:10] came to experience
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:16] I think of that Lord perhaps sitting
[1:39:19] right here this morning there's someone
[1:39:22] Lord they felt ignored
[1:39:27] I pray Lord God may you help them this
[1:39:33] morning by that witness of the Holy
[1:39:37] Spirit that you would break that forth
[1:39:41] and cause it to stand out Lord to let
[1:39:44] them know that you know what it is to
[1:39:50] feel ignored Lord we've all been in
[1:39:53] situations sometimes we've been where a
[1:39:56] conversation is but it's like we're on
[1:39:58] the outside listening in talked all
[1:40:02] around we've been there Lord it's things
[1:40:07] that we we feel but help us not to make
[1:40:14] our feelings something Lord that we
[1:40:20] begin to dictate our behavior
[1:40:24] but may when Lord submitted to you Lord
[1:40:30] may we bring it to Europe your throne
[1:40:34] Lord those in here this morning Lord
[1:40:39] that are suffering in their body pain
[1:40:45] you bought our griefs you bore their
[1:40:49] grief lord I read over things this week
[1:40:56] your prophet would place it so clearly
[1:41:00] you know our pain what right here to
[1:41:08] think in this building this morning that
[1:41:10] one Lord that would be sick in their
[1:41:12] body if it was no one else you bore
[1:41:18] their sickness your prophet said it like
[1:41:24] this he said that you would be a
[1:41:27] faithful and merciful high priest to
[1:41:30] know how to reconcile us to Grace and to
[1:41:33] know how to reconcile our body back to
[1:41:37] health again
[1:41:39] more cheese's
[1:41:44] the only thing Lord God that we can do
[1:41:49] is say thank you we can say thank you
[1:41:55] Lord from our hearts this morning Lord
[1:41:57] whatever that need is maybe it's lonely
[1:42:01] maybe it's feeling lonely
[1:42:04] it's feeling all alone
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:09] Lord God may they take Lord God the word
[1:42:16] of their high priest say he's sitting
[1:42:22] there you're interceding from me Lord
[1:42:27] what god you're my comfort I'm not alone
[1:42:31] Lord you're with me I know I I may not
[1:42:35] have company right now contact maybe
[1:42:38] with son but Lord how so remember that
[1:42:41] I'm not going to let the enemy put me in
[1:42:44] a corner the Bible says he that hath
[1:42:47] friends must show himself friend
[1:42:50] Oh God
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:56] thank you Jesus what God for the sin 6ol
[1:43:04] this morning Lord God reeling upon the
[1:43:09] sea of life may this morning Lord God
[1:43:13] they take a hold of that lifeline that's
[1:43:17] pointed out to him Lord God and may Lord
[1:43:21] God their ship their boat as it were may
[1:43:24] it come
[1:43:26] to the harbor of Refuge in Christ Jesus
[1:43:33] rennet Lord God for you're not an idea
[1:43:37] you are the very King of glory Lord
[1:43:42] Jesus granted this morning Granite Lord
[1:43:48] for every need
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:51] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:43:53] I want you to think of this as your eyes
[1:43:57] your closed your heads are bound the
[1:44:02] quote I just read to you to think of how
[1:44:05] that God would so anoint the Prophet in
[1:44:09] this hour to where these things would be
[1:44:12] so vividly depicted for us he sits there
[1:44:17] for your sickness he sits there for your
[1:44:22] temptation he sits there for your pain
[1:44:25] he sits there that you might come to
[1:44:30] know his grace say this morning
[1:44:35] greatest thing we can do is recognize
[1:44:37] that whatever that you've got a need
[1:44:40] that's pressing on your heart this
[1:44:42] morning he knows how you feel
[1:44:47] he knows what you you knows what you're
[1:44:50] going through you might look at it as a
[1:44:53] sister and say well God became a man
[1:44:56] how could he understand me but sis
[1:45:00] please remember temptation only comes
[1:45:03] through three gates and he conquered the
[1:45:06] gates of the enemy he understands just
[1:45:11] like we said about the teenagers today
[1:45:13] they've experienced different means of
[1:45:16] things coming at them but it is the same
[1:45:19] pressures why don't you right now just
[1:45:26] speak to your high priest whatever that
[1:45:31] need is this morning you know it's
[1:45:34] already touched your need has already
[1:45:36] touched him to draw him into this place
[1:45:40] of his word to speak this to you and I
[1:45:43] why don't you just take this moment I'd
[1:45:48] start off by thanking him that's what I
[1:45:50] do

[1:50:10] thank you Lord Jesus don't you just
[1:50:14] appreciate his dissension appreciate how
[1:50:17] he conned in Cindy said Lord help me
[1:50:22] help me Lord context help me Lord oh my
[1:50:29] I'm so grateful for that no matter what
[1:50:32] we would feel
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:36] you know maybe I could go to you about
[1:50:39] something you could come to me maybe I
[1:50:43] wouldn't understand maybe I've never
[1:50:45] been through that angle or that part of
[1:50:47] it but still would be a part of it to
[1:50:50] try to understand what it is that you're
[1:50:53] going through or what you're dealing
[1:50:56] with
[1:50:57] but I'm glad that he can reach to a
[1:51:00] level of understanding that's beyond
[1:51:04] what I could ever reach to as a matter
[1:51:08] of fact brother Brennan put it like this
[1:51:09] in different places and the message that
[1:51:11] I didn't get to and actually by him
[1:51:13] moving inside of us helps us to get to
[1:51:17] that place of sympathy that we need to
[1:51:20] be yet how can we do it how can we
[1:51:27] but I'm glad I'm glad to think about it
[1:51:31] when you've been able to sympathize with
[1:51:35] someone else instead of saying I can't
[1:51:39] believe it
[1:51:41] Jesus don't do that to you hey don't do
[1:51:45] it to Menza you've got to be know he
[1:51:49] understands and he's there to intercede
[1:51:54] he knows just what we need you know
[1:51:59] friends it isn't just about our failures
[1:52:01] that he's a high priest
[1:52:02] that's not even when I tell them what
[1:52:03] I'm done most suffering right now we do
[1:52:06] suffer even when we fail is that right
[1:52:10] there's a suffering even in our failing
[1:52:13] but I'm talking about even when we're
[1:52:16] looking at the word and saying lord I
[1:52:17] want to attain to that that's my goal
[1:52:23] he's setting there as the high priest to
[1:52:26] make good on our confession he's there
[1:52:31] to present his life to say well they
[1:52:35] have asked for
[1:52:37] is that their character would be so
[1:52:40] molded and the expression of this life
[1:52:42] in them they've asked for that and his
[1:52:45] life is there to speak on our behalf and
[1:52:47] it's through his vicarious suffering
[1:52:51] that he did that that issue comes to us
[1:52:57] to what we have been desiring he makes
[1:53:01] good on it were his workmanship he is
[1:53:07] our high priest
[1:53:09] I'm so glad about that or Jesus would
[1:53:16] you go with the sword as we go our
[1:53:18] separate ways this morning watch over a
[1:53:21] sword father it's so good to see each

[1:54:01] pronounced that it takes their attention

[1:55:09] car that come in ran him hit him
[1:55:13] the doctors gathered around and they
[1:55:15] began to look at the man and then they
[1:55:17] had a private conference they said every
[1:55:21] bone has broken his body he's all he's a
[1:55:24] mess let's just cover him up it's not
[1:55:28] worth it we're not we won't get one bit
[1:55:30] of money out of it but he said that man
[1:55:33] spoke up
[1:55:35] and he said gentlemen just a moment I am
[1:55:41] worth something for my precious Lord
[1:55:47] Jesus shed his blood for me he purchased
[1:55:52] me he gave the ultimate purchase I am
[1:56:01] worth something
