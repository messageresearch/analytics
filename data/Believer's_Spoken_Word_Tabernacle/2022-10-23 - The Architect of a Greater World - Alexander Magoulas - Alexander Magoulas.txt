you know I was I saw this thing the other day but it's interesting what they they put news articles apparently because I did this thumbs up thing I found out this is this is microaggression now and I'm thinking man this one so I'm like man you give me the thumbs up I'm usually hey they're going to give me money or high five or something you know this world's falling apart amen amen again but we're not getting adjusted to this world we were looking for one to come amen amen we're like Abraham we're looking for a city amen he was looking for it because he met the king of it and we believe that it's not far off we're already part of the citizenry of that place and uh not just the citizen we were part of the family amen God bless you good to be with the family of God here today good to see so many come out um your sister Norma was her name is she here today I know that she's here God bless you it's good to have you with us is this is this where's I can't find her she's now my eyes are getting dipped hi there I'm sorry now I've embarrassed her I didn't mean to embarrass it's nice to have you with us any other visitors we have here today is there anybody visiting for the first time or anything it's nice to have all the home folk here today as well God bless you we are just certainly blessed amen if you uh would just bow your heads with me I invite you to pray with me here for a moment and we'll look into the word of God this this morning and this afternoon as well our gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful that as the eagle stirs The Nest so you're stirring up this bride Lord You've not made us for this world but for a greater World which is to come Lord the greatness of that world to come it eclipses and it exceeds anything that this world could offer us Lord we look at the times and the conditions of the world today and Lord I'm let our meditation not be upon the things that are but the things which are to be knowing that you've gone to prepare a place that you've made plans for us you've got plans for this bride today you've not ordained us unto wrath into a tribulation but you've ordained us unto life to obtain salvation through Jesus Christ and Lord we're so thankful today as We Gather here may our thoughts turn towards things which are Heavenly today things which are true things which are pure pure which are of good report let us meditate upon things above today as we look into the word of God may you open the scripture to us and break the bread of life to us once again even as you did the disciples there on the road to Emmaus and father in this service there's many needs in the people today father needs that I is a man I'm unaware of and perhaps we ourselves are even unaware at times of what we need in our own lives but we're so mindful that and we're so thankful that the Creator is mindful of us you know the creation you're the Potter and we're just the clay today Lord have your way in this place and shape us and mold us as vessels of Honor unto you unto your great glory and praise and we thank you now may there not be a one walk out of here needing today but may they receive the that what you have need of is Boaz left for roots so may you drop something for each one today I mean we go to this place rejoicing in the full Assurance of our Salvation if we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles today we'll be looking at the book of Nehemiah the second chapter I just spoke here a few weeks ago and I was talking about uh the hero of a greater world and contrasting the idea that that it's a greater world than this one you know there are certain things that Christ is doing and he fulfills in our life now that he you know there'll be no need for a Healer in a greater world Amen he's the Healer now but in that world there won't be need for real he will all be whole amen there'll be no sickness there'll be no mind battles there'll be no crying or weeping for the former things they're all passed away amen so we want to really meditate upon this greater world because the beginning Christ is the first fruits of the new creation and we are the same we're the children we're the Church of the firstborn and so creation the new creation is already in The Believer today and so we want to look here in the book of Nehemiah the second chapter and uh we'll start in verse 10. uh just to preface this for those that aren't familiar with it of course Nehemiah has the King has has uh has approached him about his concern about Jerusalem and he spoke he prayed and he spoke to the king and the Kings give him leave to go back to Jerusalem and he's also given him leave to procure whatever he needs for his journey and so that he's found great favor in the sight of the king and this is a pretty tremendous thing of itself and so he's fixing to go back to Jerusalem because he's heard about the condition of it being destroyed and run down and I I I was going to start in verse 11 but I want to start in verse 10 because I want to talk about the opposition for just a moment that he encountered and the Bible says here when Samba the horror night and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel it really bothered somebody cared about God's people and grieve them exceedly there's a man that's come to turn on the light there's a man that's come to help God's people I'm already moving around I haven't finished my text it really bothered them yeah they were really disappointed somebody wants to help out God's people I say let them be disappointed us and human just get as mad as he wants because there's a man here that can turn on light God has come down to help this people today in this generation amen God sent a man back then and God has sent us a message today I'm so mad as much frustration as much trouble as I've had in my life I hope to revisit that upon him just a little bit praise the Lord and grieve them here comes somebody to help God's people the children of Israel so Nehemiah shows up verse 11 so I came to Jerusalem and was there three days and I arose in the night I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do it Jerusalem neither was there any peace with me save the Beast that I wrote upon this all day amen there's one Beast carrying him and I went out by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well into the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king's pool but there was no place for the Beast that was under me to pass pretty bad situation then I went up to the night but in the Night by the Brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned and the rulers knew not whether I went or what I did neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work then said I unto them ye see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and then he said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated today so if I could continue kind of with the thought I had from last time talking about the hero of a greater World I'd like to speak today and I think it's I just love how the songs come together and everything I'd like to speak today about the architect of a greater world the architect of a greater world and you know as I was meditating on this and looking at this one of the things that I was thinking about is you know many times the carnally minded people they often ask the question they look at the world and the condition it's in today and they look at it and say well if God is good and he made everything why is the world so bad you know why is there homelessness and and sickness and starvation and depression and every evil work if he's a righteous God why does it permit so much evil if he's a loving God why does he send people to hell but I want you to remember that they are there the Bible says they're willingly ignorant amen they look at these things and they want to criticize but they're ignorant of the whole purpose and plan of God we're living in the end times we just talked about the whole world's falling apart it's falling into a place of judgment just exactly according to the scripture it's not that God didn't foresee it it's all part of God's plan it was it was ordained to do this he's foretold it we see clearly you think about it as Believers we can look at the world condition we clearly identify it they scratched their head they mock God they make fun of it and you and I we read this Bible and we literally see scripture coming to pass day after day we see the things that Prophet spoke about being fulfilled and the world doesn't even see it it's right there in black and white it's right there on tape and the World At Large they walk in their own lusts and the Bible says they scoff and say where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers all things continue as they had before but the Bible says for this they're willingly ignorant amen they're willingly injured that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the worlds that were then they were overflowed and they perished amen but the heavens and earth which are now by the same word they are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and the Perdition of ungodly men so in other words the world's in the condition is in today because the very same word that upholds it is the very same word that is reserved it for judgment so they can look at these things coming to pass and they scoff but you and I are not ignorant that the answer why is the world in the condition it's in today why are things so evil and bad in the world today it's not because of the design of God do they want to blame God but God's with the architect of this Eden amen his eating was a different design it had a different Foundation it had a different purpose amen but this this Eden we're in now it's Satan's Eden it is the perversion of the design of God because I want to remind you that Satan is not a Creator he cannot create there's nothing original from Satan but he's a perverter and a distorter of whatever God has done so this Cosmos that we are in today is by the design of Satan and by the kingdom of darkness and that's why it's in the condition it's in today amen it's been transformed from the original design into Satan's now you talk about the original creation and I love brother Brandon how he just he breaks into these things and he dramatizes it and he he goes to some length he's talking about the original creation because you know he looks in there he talks about the six days being a six thousand years each days is a thousand years and I love because the problem would talk about how you know God took these six thousand years to carefully craft this place for his children to dwell he took these great volcanoes and magma maybe that the war was like before and he began to bring up mountains and land masses and God planted Seas seasoning and he caused life to team forth from those places and the lion in the lamb they laid down together and the Stars he hung everything in a perfect place and brother Brown uses uh he uses this term it was perfect it was perfect peace Perfect Harmony and so God creates everything with a certain kind of a Harmony where everything works together and I want to remind you today the reason I'm saying all this and I'm bringing this up is I want to remind you that God painted this great picture if I could say it this way God took this great work of art in this picture and his canvas and his easel was not a blank slate it wasn't blank but he took a chaos and a disorder because the Bible says that the Earth was without form and it was void so in the midst of disorder and Chaos God looks into it and he sees Aiden and he sees a masterpiece and he begins to work on his own creation and he begins to work on this the the different things and he forms this Eden out of a time of chaos amen and we see this time and time again in the Bible because it would be one thing amen it's one thing for God to take a blank canvas or a blank Slade and make something and do that that would be great but God in this chaos he comes in here maybe it was volcanic or whatever like the prophet said and he begins to do this and brother Brown says God's a great contractor because he lays all the stuff out at the beginning he doesn't have to go buy parts he's not like me when I work on a Home Project I lose a tool so I gotta go to the store to buy a tool that I lost I've got five at home when I go enough I realize I got the wrong board and you know you should measure twice and cut once because if not you're going back to buy another two by four by the time you're done you've spent more on gas and your house alone was worse but God's not that kind of a contractor he does exactly what he needs and he places all the material there and everything he needed for Eden everything he needed in the creation all those seeds and that light it was all laying there at the beginning and he simply is taking the material that is already there and he's bringing it into order he's bringing into form amen and I want you to remember that because it's just like the it's like here in the book of Nehemiah it'd be one thing for a man to come in and he starts a successful business he starts a successful church he makes a successful work of art but it's an entirely another thing when a man or a woman they can come into a situation which is in disorder which is in chaos which is falling apart and he can come and bring order that chaos and bring a restoration it's one thing if he just builds it right the first time but they're coming when somebody else has messed it up yeah when there's been this horror and to come and make that greater than it was before only God can do that amen praise the Lord you think about Nehemiah he comes to Jerusalem he doesn't have a draft rolled up and they're taped off where they're gonna build and everything's laid out for him there's a bunch of boards there he comes to a disaster he comes to wreckage and a rubble and chaos and he doesn't tell anybody what he's doing and he sets out in the middle of the night he begins to survey this is what's going on here I can't even get to this spot this is really bad yeah he gets there and he's coming into this situation he can't even take his Mount certain places but that's what makes him such a great example to us because he is handed a bunch of disorder he's handed chaos and he looks at these men he speaks to the Nobles he speaks to the rulers he says you see how great a distress we're in right this is a bad situation it don't look good you see how great the distress is Jerusalem lies in a ways the gates are burned with fire and you know what praise God he could have thrown in the towel I didn't know what I was getting into when I prayed about this when I was here in Babylon and I heard about this I didn't know how bad it was I heard it was bad but it's worse than I heard you know what I'm gonna throw in the towel it's a lost cause I shouldn't have asked the king you know God doesn't allow me to have favor with the King God has given me provision and he brought me here with the works too great I'm just gonna forget the whole thing but he didn't do this did you see how great it is you see how everything Lies when it's come let us build up the walls of Jerusalem let's do something about it if God is with us who can be against us if God has given us the material God has provided us a plan it doesn't matter how Bleak the situation looks it doesn't matter how much chaos we see in front of us God is not looking at that the way the men looked at it Nehemiah look at that rubble and see a lost cause he had a vision this will be restored you're looking at a bunch of walls broken down but this man's seeing a restoration let's build and he begins to speak to them and they they come together oh my God because he's seeing something that nobody else can see and I love it because he begins to testify hey man you get a testimony this morning this man begins to testify listen God is the one that brought me here today I'm walking around the city tonight because God dealt with this King God can be favored with his King God laid it on his heart to bring me here God brought me here today I'm not here by my own power God brought me to Jerusalem and the same God that brought me here he brought me here for a purpose that purpose is not to run away the purpose was not to give up the purpose was to build this wall again hey and he begins to testify to the Nobles and the rulers about the hand of God on his life and the favor of the king and they become stirred up they get inspired with his vision and they join together and the scripture says they said let us rise up and build oh my because it was a dire situation didn't mean it had to stay that way I don't know what each your situations are today and your situation might be a lot worse than my situation but I want to remind you let us rise up let us build because God has brought you here for a purpose no matter how bad it looks maybe because of how bad it looks God has brought you here God has brought you to this place in your life because he wants to bring about a design he's an architect of a greater world and what it is now is not what it's going to be and what it is in your life it's not what it's going to be one day you don't have to walk out of here with a bunch of broken down walls you don't have to walk out of here with a home that's in a bunch of chaos God can bring order God brings restoration I want to remind you today if you remember nothing else God excels at bringing order out of Chaos sells it going into creation that's fallen and destroyed and he brings orders of the diarist of situations this people Jerusalem they were a byword and a hissing all the nations and his God is telling you uh Jeremiah Nehemiah it's my son Nehemiah he's telling him I'm going to take away your approach I'm going to make this a testimony that even your enemies will recognize the hand of God in your life [Applause] wonderful God excels at bringing chaos out of order God Specializes in things thought impossible he doesn't just do it it's his specialty he's really good at it he's he's kind of showing it off look what I can do you might not be able to fix this but God can fix anything that's the problem we try to do a bunch of renovation let God come in your life once all the material is laying there he knows what he's doing if he can take the primordial chaos of the old world he can take that and bring forth and Eden and listen like I said he didn't just fix it up he made it perfect it wasn't just now I taped it together to be good for a few years till he saw the thing like I do hey man no it was perfect this is God we're talking about we're talking about God and brother man talks about it in the scripture talks about his seven Redemptive names God is a redeemer wanting to show off his Redemptive nature because it was in him to be a redeemer he cannot be a redeemer unless there's something to redeem so God is show off his power as a redeemer he allows man he allows circumstances he allows things to come into a condition of disorder and chaos to show he's still a redeemer he's a Creator and he's a redeemer and in the worst situations the most dire of circumstances he can weave and shape in to a masterpiece praise God program says this and Satan's Eden he says God's Eden was established in righteousness Satan's Eden is established in sin because Satan is sin God is righteous and God's kingdom was established in our righteousness and peace and life and Satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin now it makes sense that his chaos that that Satan's Eden is established in sin because it was founded and predicated on a lie the whole thing's built on a single lie as one lie on top of the other and has become a Web of Lies and the whole thing's just lies all the time it's all the deception because he's distorted the Commandment of God that's what he did in the beginning he didn't deny the Commandment he just distorted well you know you have God did he really say it because listen you're not going to die I mean I mean you might get in trouble but it's not as bad as it looks he only had to change one word and based on the change of one word he has built his own Eden after six thousand years the penalty thereof he's a pervertor of the truth he distorts the penalty he distorts the idea behind it because again he cannot create his own order he cannot design his own thing he must pervert the design of God and I I think to myself how incredibly frustrating it must be for a being which is obsessed with his own Beauty and his own Pride to know that no matter how hard he tries no matter what he does he can never be a creator he can lie he can Bluff the whole world he can trick everybody but yeah it must be so frustrating for all he's done and for all of his achievement in the world's condition today for all that God has placed what that being wanted what Satan won he's placed it in his children creative power it's in your tongue death and life are in the power of your tongue in our tongues we use him a lot for death and the world uses them a lot for death but there's life in your tongue as well your tongue has the power to speak worlds into existence your your tongue if it's yielded to God has the power to impart a life he can't do that if he wants to [Music] he's done all kinds of things he can impersonate almost every gift and everything else he's like I said he's got the whole world the whole world the Bible says whose names are not in the Lamb's Book of Life they're deceived they're Spellbound by what Satan has done in this day and yet for all that he has achieved he can't speak of squirrel in existence they can't give a little vicious life back he can't restore the eyes of the bond he can't redeem he can't say he's nothing but a bluff he wants people to think it's great but it's not great compared to this first Eden it doesn't even compare and it does not compare to that which is to be that which is to come amen I want you to remember this the fruit of chaos is confusion I mean that's the fruit of cats when you have confusion and you have all these things and that's what he's done he's he's cast confusion in the world he's cast chaos in the world he's the author of confusion that's why it's in a chaotic condition today he's the one that did that hey man he did that you put the little sticker on the gas pumps like that yeah I did that Satan did that you wonder why it looks bad day Satan did that he built it well praise the Lord but the fruit of order is harmony amen God is not the author of confusion the original creation had Harmony the harmony was within itself and with God and that Harmony is now gone because chaos has been introduced by the LIE of Satan and that's why the world's falling apart and all creation the Bible says all creation is now groaning because creation itself is a witness this isn't how it's supposed to be and in the cycles of life and the things we see in nature it testifies the lion doesn't lay down with the lamb anymore things are not as it was once it used to be but they will be that way again amen but the disorder of this world today that's why I'm saying this this is the it's a it's a testament or an earmark of Satan's brand of craftsmanship you know I love that you get these professional you know uh the art dealers or art critics or whatever and they can spot a fake you know we look at it and scratch my head what looks like the Mona Lisa and I don't realize she's got a beard or something you know what I mean there's a little thing on a place here a different color yeah I have no idea but somebody that really knows what they're looking at that can identify the artist if it's a genuine or fake because there's certain things about the way the artist did it there's certain things about the material that they use or whatever they can spot a fake from the real and listen and let me say this as a Critic of Satan's work I can identify his work according to the scripture when you see chaos and you see this order you see sickness and death that's the work of Satan we know who designed that we know who put that there we're not confused about it we can identify it amen because Satan's entire Eden is marked with death and chaos and that's how he notes his work the Bible says that the wisdom that is from beneath it's Earthly it's sensual it's devilish where everything in Strife is there's confusion and every evil work so you know who the designer of it is because of how it turned out it's always death it's always confusion it's always evil so like an architect or an artist he leaves something behind and what he does that he can always identify who did it you can authenticate his work by this identifier but I want to remind you again no matter how bad it looks God excels at bringing chaos out of order amen because he's not the author of confusion but of Peace it's his identification his identification is peace his identification is harmony his identification is the reconciliation of things by creation into Redemption amen and this is Believers we already know that the heavens and the Earth they will be renovated the Bible said that old things are going to pass away and all things are going to be made new and God being a good contractor all the materials already laying here right now and then when God renovates this Earth and he brings about a new heavens and a new Earth he's not getting a new lump of clay he's not going to new generation of people he's going to take what's lame here today in Sheffield Ohio he's going to take what's laying on the Earth today and he's going to fasten it out of the material that's already laying here everything he needs to do it is in this building today it's in you today to do it amen you don't have to go buy more or fabricate more or furnish more he's got it in you he's got it it's already there amen praise the Lord all the material the Bible says all things we've talked about it earlier all things are upheld by the word of his power hey man everything around us the things what you're seeing they're made of things which are unseen this is because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not there the very power that reserves the world that formed the world is going to redeem the world it's going to change the world Amen and we believe that we believe it was his spirit in the beginning in the in the disorder of the original creation when the Earth was without form and void it was his Spirit his Spirit began to brood over the Earth it began to brood and bring life where there was death but there was life laying there in a seed form it was laying in the original creation there amen Hallelujah you know it's interesting because brother Ram talks about the Earth because the Earth has an attribute of God and we're attributes of God and we're part of the Earth We're each part of the earth and the way he redeems Mance the way he redeems the world the world's had his baptism and then the flood brother Ram says it has baptism it had it was washed off the blood of Jesus Christ when he was crucified it fell from the cross and it paid the price it fell to the Earth as the price of sanctification to redeem the Earth but he's fixing to burn the Earth all the elements will be melted with a ferving heat it's going to receive its baptism of fire because it's got to be cleansed in order for a new creation amen and that's when everything comes into Divine Harmony once again the lion lays down with the lamb and all things are are new they're at that point and the Bible says that the scripture talks about it in that place there'll be no more death Hallelujah that's all we've known since we were born as death we see it all around us from the time we're a little kid we see death and sorrow and pain my little boy Moses he got hurt last night he whacked his head in another kid and got this big old goose egg and this and that and I was like man I you know as a parent you don't want to have to hurt ever but you know that's kind of how they learn that's that's how we learn this Earth we go through things but in this place you won't have to learn nothing the hard way be no more death there'll be no sorrow the former things are passed away and he that son on the throne said behold I make all things new Hallelujah oh it's it's so Sublime it's it's Transcendent how can a man know that now we've read the scripture about how can you know because he's done the same thing in you he's done the same thing in you amen I've received the earnest of it in my heart already you've received the earnest of it already he's taken lives that were like that okay that old creation you were in darkness you were abound in sin you didn't know nothing about God you were as far away from God as possible but the spirit of God began to brood over your life the spirit of God began to move in your life because there was a predestinated seat laying there you didn't know nothing about it but the contractor knew all about it he laid it out and he began to take lives that were in disorder lives that were in sin lives that were far away from God and he brought them into an image this is what a son this is what a daughter of God looks like [Music] he brought you into harmony with his will amen and he looks and the Bible talks about second Corinthians If any man is in Christ he is a new creature he's a new creation old things are passed away behold I love how the wording's the same and everything behold all things are new and all things are of God talking about you now praise the Lord amen people love to talk about themselves you might as well say something nice about yourself all things in you are new and they're all of God amen behold he's wanting you to take notice because he's showing you the level of craftsmanship he's brought in you the amount of work in you he didn't just Pat you up or throw a Band-Aid on you the work he did in you it's marvelous it's marvelous in his sight it's marvelous in our eyes amen now you might not always see it in your own life hey man you might not always seen that person that you're praying for but God is Not Looking Through The Eyes of human understanding but like Nehemiah he is looking at what it will be Nehemiah was not looking at what it was then if he looked at that he would have walked away but he was looking at what it would be and God is looking in your life and saying I know what it's going to be like I know the potentials that lay there even when you don't know what's there he knows that everything's going to work out that's why the Bible says he's giving you all things that pertain to life and godliness he's identified his works and Satan's works Jesus did that in Saint John the 10th chapter he says the thief comes to steal and to kill and destroy in other words that's not why I came though I came that you would have a life and it more abundantly so God has wanted you to be able to distinguish between the works of Satan and his Works which you are his works you are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works amen to bring you into harmony because God has a way and an order of things and this is what I want you to catch with this he has a way of doing things in an order and if you Adventure outside of that it's the same designer as Satan's Eden Adventure outside of his design it's the it's the same thing you think about what makes you and I different from the rest of the world amen all right you look at Lucifer versus Iron brother bam talks about this his desire was to have Glory like God he wanted to have a kingdom like Gods amen he saw the things of God he saw the sons of God and Satan desire to have power he desired to have a position he desired to have a kingdom but he did not aspire to be like God in his character amen he wanted to have his power and his position but he didn't want the character or the humility of God amen that's the difference between you and I and the powers of Darkness that's the difference between the children of God and the children of Disobedience we have been invited the prophet said to be shaped into his character we're going to be in his likeness in his character the same designer from the beginning amen now when God creates something he can never deviate from his own order amen whatever God intended see this is the thing this is why I talk about God being a Creator when God designed a plant he designed it with a purpose it was going to make oxygen it was going to do this it was going to give fruit to the Earth everything God did God doesn't make things willy-nilly God doesn't do things just on a whim everything has a purpose and a design behind it it has a very specific purpose and anytime you pervert that purpose it's Satan's Eden hey man so that means if you had a purpose there was there's always an intent I I like this word intent or intention God always has an intent behind everything he does when God did these things in the original creation he had an intention in mind behind it so to deviate from the intention or the purpose is to deviate from the character of God because God doesn't mince words or engage in vanity we look here in the scripture you don't have to turn there but the Bible talks about this in Ezekiel 48 during the time of the restoration of the new Temple this is the I believe it's in the Millennium it's not during the new heavens and new earth because in Ezekiel 48 when it talks about the restoration of Jerusalem here they go and they restore the temple worship and we believe that's going to happen amen praise the Lord there's going to be restoration throughout the Millennium they'll keep the feasts and the sabbaths and different things but in the new heavens and new earth there is no Temple because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb is the Temple of that place that's where you and I are going but I I the reason I love the scripture he's talking about the restoration of the the Jerusalem during the Millennium and it says this in the Book of Ezekiel 48 the very last verse of Ezekiel they talk about the city and it says it's the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there the name of the Cities the Lord is there it's Jehovah shama it's one of the Redemptive names of Jehovah in the scripture in the Hebrew the city will be called Jehovah shama the Lord is there and I begin to think about this because Ezekiel is writing this during the time of captivity his people and he they're they're in This Strange Land they're in this foreign place and they remember what God had done back in the day they knew the stories about Moses and they knew about the Tabernacle they knew about David and they knew about Solomon but here they're in a captive condition their lives are chaos they're not where they need to be but he sees this and he knows that one day they're going to go back there and when they go back there and God performs these things people will look at the city they'll look at the city and say jehovah-shama the Lord is there oh look at what God has done and they'll be able to identify we know where God's at because of what he did we see his craftsmanship in the restoration of the city we see these things and we know the Lord is there glory and so it is in the new heavens we go there the Lord God Almighty is the temple amen the Lambs the light of that City because why the Lord is there we'll be able to say when we're there the Lord is here then on the outside to say the Lord said the world no he's here he's right here we know he's here because we see his workmanship he's the architect of a greater world and when you see what God has done when you see restoration you can say I know where he's at I'm not guessing I'm not wondering the Lord is there in your life today you can say you know what the Lord is here I know what he did in my life I know what I was I know where I was headed but something made a change something changed the course of your life something changed circumstances in your life that you couldn't change and you can look and say you know what the Lord is here God made the difference in my life that's why I'm where I'm at today amen hallelujah amen Jehovah shama that's his architecture amen he's he's the Divine architect brother Brown said Jesus the wise master builder himself he he told his disciples what do you tell the disciples I'm gonna go and prepare a place for you hey man now you think about this because brother Brown says he's been working out for 2000 years he's just been preparing a place for us amen and on top of that he's already got a place prepared for you the Bible says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved you've got one waiting why because he's already prepared he's got the material in there he don't have to furnish a theophany for you he don't have to work it up or whatever it's laying there it's already prepared and you've heard from it that's why you're here today that's why you're saying amen that's why you believe the word because you've heard from your theophany he's already prepared it and he's gone to prepare a place a New Jerusalem and let me just say this it's like brother Brown said we're not going to go Float On A Cloud and have a harp we're just floating around with some wispy no we're gonna have a body and we're going to come back and have a body and that body will eat and drink and we'll have houses amen God has prepared it and he's preparing it now amen because you get some people and I'll just throw this in this I guess this is free or whatever it's like when you go it's like when you go to the hotel and they say well you got complimentary breakfast well you did pay for it but I mean it's like nice that they give it to you're like yeah I got a bagel glory to God you're like wow they come with the room not in the room hopefully that'd be really good depends on how well they clean it hey man let me just say this God made a physical Earth in the beginning with physical people Jesus was physically resurrected because you have people in the message even they they try to spiritualize other something and that's not what the prophet preached that's what he thought it was until God straighten them out when he was a kid or whatever he thought well I'm gonna go be a cloud no you're gonna have a body and then you're gonna come back and have a glorified body and you're going to dwell on that body it's a physical body Christ was physically resurrected if God made a physical Earth with physical people in the beginning he never deviates from his design so Redemption has to look like look you can't restore it back if it wasn't like that in the first place it's for it to be restored it's got to be a physical body a physical Earth Amen brother man says Christianity is not based on replacement it's based on Resurrection amen he cannot deviate from the original pattern let me read this to you here it's in the future home 1964. but the RAM says this is the Divine architect amen has designed this for his beloved oh what a place it must be when divine nature a Divine architect has designed it for a Divine attribute that's been divinely predestined by Divine God who is the author of Divine Life what will that City look like think of it remember it's not in heaven John said I saw it coming down out of Heaven it's to be on the earth see now this Earth is going to pass away it's a redeemed Earth God didn't say he's going to raise up a new generation he's going to redeem the one that's already here ain't gonna raise up a new generation he redeems the one that's already here he's going to make no new world it's this one right here he's just going to burn it off cleanse it like he did you and then he says this I love this his plans must forever remain you remember that whatever God has said or done or willed once he spoke it once he's done it once he's desired it it's gonna happen it doesn't matter what calm you can get every devil out of hell and try to Reign against the will of God God will fulfill his plan because his plans must forever remain got to ordain that man would have dominion over the Earth in the beginning and guess what the fault can't stop that sin can't stop that your Hang-Ups can't stop that your first birth can't stop that his plans will forever remain he's going to have a people to Reign and rule on the earth I believe I'm looking at some of them right now amen it doesn't matter what you're going through in your job or your family his plans will forever remain he is going to bring it to pass because he's the designer of it and he's the Builder of it my mind he says remember it's going to not be to uh it's going not to be Heaven it comes down from heaven it's a Dwelling Place a place to dwell in to take up his Abode is it like John on the Isle of Patmos here in Revelation 21 he saw it descending John saw the city descending from heaven like a dove I was reading I was saying that's the same thing John the Baptist saw when Christ which is God's attribute in the earth that that piece of the earth that was his body his attribute when he come to John John saw the spirit of God descending like a dove on Christ Brother Bear makes the point that's when heavens and earth kiss there was a Reconciliation see Harmony come back in Harmony was restored the chaos there's no chaos now there's Harmony and what he did in Christ what he's going to do the new creation he's done and you and I so I sell this to make this point we're talking about Jehovah shalom amen how how is the Lord the Lord is there how do you know because of the the harmony has been restored I mean so in order to understand that you have to know what the plan of God was amen God showed Moses a design one time when he went up in the mountain he sought the Lord and God began to speak to him after 40 days God showed Moses the design of that first Tabernacle Moses was not up in the mountain with a piece of paper trying to figure out how he's going to put it together well listen God wants it this way well let me guess okay he says he wants three Tabernacle or three rooms should I do it this way should I do that no God showed him the design by inspiration and when he showed him the design he knew exactly how God wanted it put together this this pomegranate here this is gold this is Badger skin ever there was no detail there was no detail left up to Moses to figure out God showed him every part of the plan amen God is an architect he has a pattern and he always follows that same pattern brother bam says this this is in 1953 speak to the Rock brother man says how many of her read a line from your wife he says when I was in Africa my wife would write me a letter she would say dear husband I am sitting here tonight thinking of you he said I love her when I left home I didn't have to say no look no don't you have nobody else I'm your husband don't you get out here and don't you do that I don't have to do that she loves me and I love her and I say goodbye honey pray for me and I go on she just knows that's what she she just doesn't I do the same thing because I love her she loves me so it's just a love of hair that's the same way it is with God I just take his word and he just that's all there is to it no matter what you see he said but when she writes me a letter she might kind of hold back a little bat hold a little back refrain she'll say certain certain things but now what I'm talking it's just in the letter I'm reading that letter but I read between the lines too I know what she's talking about I can read between the lines he said now there's a whole lot of that so in this great love story of the Bible read between the lines there's the structure work we're talking about architecture today we're talking about building the design here's the structure work he says there's a structure the Bible is structured but the holy spirit's building the building now certainly it's got to frame together and look like this and like that and like that but the holy spirit's putting it together once you remember you didn't start it and you're not going to finish it listen Paul he rebukes the Galatians probably worsely remakes any other churches he started he rebukes the Galatians and listen having begun in the spirit are you not going to be made perfect in the flesh a lot of times as Christians as best as we get older we we begin to we're going to lean our own testimony our own understanding we begin to lean on our our reputation or these different things but listen you need to depend on God just as much today as the very first time you needed him your dependence today is not less but greater than it ever was before because the building's a little further up than it was and you're depending on him to finish the work you're not going to finish it on your own ability your flesh your human ability will not finish the work of God but the same one that started it he'll finish it the holy spirit's putting it together guess what he says he says just like Solomon's Temple oh my I love this this is good just like Solomon's Temple was cut out all over the world one block was cut from this way and one cup that way and when they come together every block went right to its place without a buzz or a saw or a sound of a hammer the great Church of the Living God is Born Again Stones cut out that's remarkable to me you go read the story it's in uh First Kings the sixth chapter then when they begin to build this Temple the scripture talks about there's no sound of a saw or a hammer or any kills of iron in the entire Temple everything that they fabricated for this Temple they brought in they cut it wherever it was at it could be over here in one place in Syria or Lebanon or wherever they would cut this plant or cut this board or shake this brunt and when they brought together it had to fit they weren't going to take it back they weren't going to okay well listen we've got it where we need bus let's just finish it up a little bit more it doesn't quite fit right when it got there it was perfect foreign think about that you know it's that's astounding from an engineering point no I'm not an engineer but just just in my mind as an amateur student of engineering that's astounding yes it is hey man because first of all that means the blueprint was so perfect they didn't have to make adjustments well we didn't know it was going to fit this way or this and that we'll make an adjustment here the plan was perfect from the get-go and Not only was it perfect there was how many different laborers think about the number of Craftsmen involved in making this Temple that took seven years I believe it was to build seven years of a guy over here with a saw and a guy over here with a hammer and every one of them we're so inspired by Solomon's Vision by the pattern that God had laid out listen it doesn't matter how good of a Craftsman you are they can't perform that in themselves God inspired the workers so much under that plan that when every piece come together it was perfect that's astounding yeah you can do that today with the best tools the best engineering you can't do it there's got to be an adjustment there's got to be a part that's rejected there's something somewhere but this plan was so perfect and the people were so inspired behind it everything fit perfect the first time astounding hey man we should think about that and they weren't just coming from a factory one place from all around the world hey man you know sometimes we we wonder how's God going to do it how's God gonna have a bride without spotter blemish you know we hear a lot about the churches or dividers today and churches are divided and people are divided denominations and groups and we've been hearing the masses the message is so divided I want to remind you today that the church is not divided impulsive Christ is not divided amen you say what about all the division listen men are divided but Christ isn't divided Christ's plan remains that's why but the brain was against the denominational spirit it's outside of the design of God we were called to be one people one Faith one Lord one baptism and and divine and men like going to camp but the body of Christ is not divided Christ is one body it's one it's one body of Christ we might be many members but it's one body amen it might not look how we think it should look but let me assure you he knows exactly how to put it together if he can take stones and logs for Solomon's Temple and bring together perfectly he can bring a body of Christ out of a rekindred and tongue and nation and tribe in people and he's not bringing together a bunch of scraps they're holy they're blameless they're accepting the Beloved they're perfect and inside they are exactly the way he designed them yes that Temple is going to come together so well you don't even there's no there's no light shining the through there's no there's not some Stone that's a little lopsided well we gotta take it bro you know brother Bill's gotta go back and we gotta reshape him a little bit no it's exactly how he wants it now you might not think that I know I'm not in the shape I want to be we could sit here and dwell on this a long time hey man but he's not looking at what you're seeing he's not looking at the chaos side man it's shaped exactly how he wants it it fits together perfectly because he's not just the architect of Solomon's Temple he's not just the architect of the Tabernacle he's the architect of a greater world the whole world he's going to come together under the headship of Jesus Christ and the Bride of Jesus Christ and there's going to be Harmony [Applause] divine order is restored the Bible says this David was talking to Solomon about this Temple it's in first Chronicles 28. and he begins to tell his son Solomon listen I've I've already made Provisions for the material right I've got a plan here all you have to do is follow this you follow this and you use what I've given you and the temple will turn out perfect salmon you don't have to make an adjustment you don't have to go find something else I it's all laid out here I've made it as easy as can be all you have to do is follow this do what I said God will take care of the rest all this said David the Lord made me to understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern that David shows him this he lays out and I love this next verse and David said to Solomon and his son be strong and of good courage to come out of place let's put this board here do this here by the way be strong of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the Lord God even my God will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou has finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord not really beginning to think about that David laid all this out for his son he's made all these provisions and he must have realized someone was getting kind of concerned amen Psalm is probably looking the same how's it going to be this is a huge undertaking this undertaking gets greater than I can bear the undertaking is greater than what I could put together I don't have the ability I don't have this skill I'm concerned and David said listen don't be afraid listen I understand why you would be afraid but don't be there's a reason you don't have to be the Lord my God will be with thee amen the Lord is there because the Lord is there no matter how great the word looks no matter how hard it seems don't be afraid you'll never fail me he'll never forsake me my my God said I'm gonna finish this work this is gonna be my foot still this is the place I'm gonna put my name and if he would do that with that natural Temple which was to be destroyed how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ who will not be destroyed who will not enter into wrath but she shall endure forever yeah I'm saying this for a reason I want to remind you that the same architect he designed the worlds with meticulous care he designed this Temple he designed all these things he laid out the foundation of the world everyone's going to prepare a place for you he designed all these Tabernacles he's the one who called you hey man listen you're not fashioned after this world that's why you don't fit in you weren't shaped to fit in this Temple you were shaped to fit in a greater one Your Design is not flawed your first birth is flawed that's Satan's designed but your second birth it's not flawed it's shaped exactly how God wants it listen he's the one working on it and you try to make it fit into this world it's never going to fit because it's not designed for it see when God designed you he designed you with an intention wanted to fit in one to be popular one to have an easy time it was to be a part of his habitation to be a dwelling place for the most high God Amen and sometimes we get like Solomon we get All Shook Up well God I just know how you're gonna do in my life I don't know how you're gonna help my family I don't know how I don't know how to overcome this addiction I don't know how many overcome this complex listen don't be afraid fear not he's the one that's with you he knows exactly how to get it into the right condition from the building amen we get shook up we listen we get shook up sometimes people get shook up I don't know I'm gonna make in the Rapture I don't even know I'm gonna make it through the day God knows how he's gonna do it God's not shook up about it God's not ringing his hands God's not worried I don't know how I'm gonna get you in you've just done make too many mistakes God knows exactly what to do to get you in the condition and sometimes it might not be real comfortable sometimes you might not like it but guess what God knows what he's doing no one can design a piece of architecture like God no one can design like God and if he's made you a part of the plan you've got every reason never to be afraid oh but I've got circumstances I've made mistakes God knows what he's doing when you're done your life and your times have not been left up to circumstance it has not been left up to chance when God oh my when God looked at you through eternity down the quarters of time he looked at you with a purpose that's my daughter that's my son that's not canon fodder that's not the leftover that's not the the foolish version there's a son there's a daughter I've got a place on the earth they're going to rule I've got a purpose reserve for them he knows exactly what it's going to be and where it's at listen your substance when it was hit of the earth and all the molecules that make up your body today were scattered throughout the the food that your ancestors and everything God knew every molecule where it would go we make a mistake like I just don't want me to make it I just done messed up too bad oh I just I don't have you know I did this wrong I did that wrong right I don't see it this way or I'm not this way I wish I was like this one or that one God knows what he's doing when he designed you foreign don't look at God's architecture say well I wish God had done it different God he could have done this with my life God made you the way he wanted for a reason because I can't take the board's place and the board can't take my place hey man we get all worried about we get all concerned but there's no virtue and worry but brother my life's a complete mess I've got all kinds of issues I've got so much trouble and issues I there's nowhere to begin listen that's what DMI came in across hey man it was it wasn't just a board falling over the whole thing was a wreck but let me remind you once where God excels at bringing order out of Chaos God excels at bringing children into harmony with his will yeah God can take dry bones pull them together put skin on him and put sin on him and raise him up and breathe life into dead dry bones that are scattered everywhere and make an exceeding great Army God can take something out of nothing [Applause] your life is not so far removed from the will of God that he can't make a change but the trick is that the solutions let him do the work we try too much to do ourselves because we don't like how it looks but the problem is we're looking at the rubble we're not looking at the finished product because only God sees the finished product amen I don't see your finished product I don't even see my own you don't see mine you don't see your own but God does see it every time God looks at you and he's always looking at you every time God looks at you he doesn't see the mistake he doesn't see the human weakness he sees a finished product he says the process that I've put you in will make you turn out exactly how I want you to be you said so perfectly that when the time comes there won't be one thing that needs changed my God knows what he's doing how many times in our own lives maybe you maybe you feel this way I don't know but how many times your own lives can you look back you seem like you were never going to be able to get through another day I don't know how to overcome this problem I don't know how I'm ever going to survive this I don't know how I'm gonna be able to endure this Lord I have no idea how I'm gonna draw my next breath but you know what you're here amen because God Can Make A Way when there is no way listen there's no way for me to get through this at this alley this is so dilapidated God can make a way where there is no way what are you worried about we don't have to worry about what it looks like there's only one thing we need to know he's there if he's there if jehoma Shalom is there then he can fix it amen people take this message and you know I've heard it for years well people took this message and they've made it into a mass and this and that you ever heard that before well listen that's not my testimony my testimonies God came in the mess of my life and he turned into a message I believe the message but I have a message your message when life was a mess God took your mess and he turned into a message he's still a redeemer he's still a Healer he's still a savior he's still a restorer broken homes he's still a person that can change the circumstances my life's not a mess amen it's a message your life's not a mess that might look like it to everybody else but God is writing a story in your life your life is a message to A Dying World to a defeated world that there's something's going to believe this word this someone's gonna take God at their word when nobody else wants to believe God somebody's gonna believe God somebody's gonna get a testimony somebody's gonna rise up and build when no one else wants to build they've heard the testimony of God they've heard the message of the hour and they've come together like the people under Nehemiah and they said let us rise up don't sit there and wallow and sell pity don't sit there and cry rallies up and build rise up against the powers of Darkness rise up against circumstances they're trying to put defeat in your life you've got the strength you've got the ability through Christ to rise up [Applause] Jehovah shalom Jehovah Jehovah's signature he knows what he's doing in your life he's a redeemer and listen he's here he's not just there he's here today is a witness the divine plan of God in your life listen God is not a sloppy businessman he knows what he's doing he's not like some people brother Ram said when he makes an investment he knows exactly why he made it the intent and the purpose is already laying there hey man you know in our own lives I say I sell this for a reason our own lives the question is not usually what we're going through we all know what we're going through you take job's friends and they show up and job's going through this well job you're doing this and job you did that and this and that listen job did not need to hold the that's going through trouble well I just didn't know I have no idea I thought everything was going great I mean everybody died everything blew up the question was not what he was going he knew exactly what he was going through you know better than anybody what you're going through you don't need me to tell you your question John's question my question why why are we going through it Joe looks I don't know what I did wrong he didn't do anything wrong the designer knew what he was doing right you can have a time test Memorial he said you know what I'm gonna take this piece this part my temple and I'm gonna prove it I'm gonna let Satan work on him and do everything but take his life to prove that he can stand the test of time he didn't do anything wrong he was being proven my mind why in other words what's the intention that's why we it's not so much what you and I do we can do all the right things for all the wrong reasons and it's extension God's sight suspension is nostrils it's not what we do it's why our motive our objective our purpose Our intention when God does something we look and say but why why did God design it this way why did God let me go through this why is God allowed the life that I've been in to be so chaotic at times why is he allowed pain and hurt and rejection and just Devastation we know why because all things all things work together for good for them that love God for them who are the called according to his purpose his intent his design his design is why amen we're looking at the problem we're not looking at the design behind it listen this problem's not a problem it's an opportunity God's going to use it to get glory for himself in your life amen you know people are funny People Are People you know people they're just these there's just these clusters of drama and activity you look at the World At Large like I said at the beginning you know they blame the system they blame the government or half of the government or whichever part of the government they want they blame their employer they blame the pastor they blame the church they blame family they blame everybody for everything negative that ever happens in their life you and I would ask the question why because with Christians many times we tend to get frustrated with ourselves because we possess this strange capacity to repent the world doesn't have amen for us it's no longer a foregone conclusion that we're always right about everything the world's like I'm not wrong everybody else is wrong not me we actually can be like you know what Maybe I'm Wrong we laugh because not everybody can do that you go work a job for a week you'll find out real quick not everybody can be wrong not everybody can be sorry not everybody can own updated I mean you see in politics all the time it's literally always somebody else's I've never heard a politician what's my fault never heard it you know why because people are dumb enough to believe it's somebody else's fault amen I thought I thought you'd be rolling on that one it's true they don't take response but you and I we know we can be wrong we know we have to repent they can't do that but the issue is sometimes we begin to sit there and we look and say well I must have done something wrong I must have found God somewhere I'm not good enough I'm not I'm not whatever I need to be it's like the disciples the Last Supper they're all sitting there with Lord is it eyes at me is it my fault something to miss when something's wrong we blame ourselves listen it's not always your fault hey man it's not always your fault why am I going through this sometimes it's just for the glory of God it's not your fault always amen see we're looking at our own ability not the architect's ability well I must have did something wrong that's not in the equation amen he's the one that's doing it and sometimes when things are not worry sometimes in your life's in chaos I want to encourage you not everything's your fault amen sometimes you just have to have patience amen I want to encourage you today to have patience with God all right because he's the one that's bringing everything into divine order no matter what you're dealing with today whatever the problem the Lord is there in your problem the Lord is there in your situation the Lord is there in your sickness the Lord is there in your mind battle because he wants to change the situation he wants to bring about his purpose and his intention so be patient with God he's still Jehovah shama he'll never leave you or forsake you let patience have her perfect work the Bible says amen through faith and patience we inherit the promises the Bible says you have need of patience and after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise see we endure many things as Christians amen we endure many things but the Bible says to endure them patiently because many times we're very quick I'm bringing this to a close but I just want you to remember this many times we lose patience amen the Bible says he's the husband of the earth he's got long patience he's not sweating how it's going to turn out he's taking his time for a reason he's got long patience you know in the original creation he took six thousand years Bill Bram talks about and I really this is why I was this whole sermon how I'm talking about this why why in the creation he's God he can do it as fast listen God can do anything anytime he wants is it's not like he had to build up the ability to make things why did God take his time in creation because some things are worth taking their time for amen some things get better with time amen without time passing listen if time doesn't go past there's no such thing as transformation without time passing there's no such thing as growth without the passage of time so some things take time because they're worth taking time for and God allowed himself to have six thousand years pass in creation as a testament that it was worth taking time to do why because you're worth taking time amen God's not impatient with you God's not upset and trying to ring his hands and figure out how he's going to do plan B in your life God's very patient with you God is more patient with you than you are yourself and that's what I want to remind you today many times we're quick to lose patience with God or someone else many times we're not patient with ourselves that's why we live defeated and that's why we get upset and that's why we get frustrated we say I I it shouldn't be this way listen be patient with yourself God's patient with you you're worth being patient with all right if God says you're worth taking time God says you're worth taking time to shape and to fashion and to grow listen if he thinks that about you you ought to think that about you [Applause] like I said many times as a Christian especially we're the person that can't have patience with us the pastor and the Deacon and everyone we can have patience with everybody else but ourselves but if you're gonna be patient about the work of God be patient about God's work in your own life allow God to take his time listen him taking his time is an Evidence of his care for you because he likes you the way he designed you he doesn't necessarily like the way the world tried to shape you but he likes the way he designed you he likes the way you sing at church he likes the way you think about that person nobody else thinks about he likes the way you smile he likes the way you pray he loves it when you pray he likes these things about you he's paid we're all frustrated with ourselves why can't I be more like this why can't I be this way listen be patient your worth being patient with we've all got problems but don't get discouraged don't give up on yourself we are quicker to give up on ourselves than God is to give up on us God doesn't give up on us we do that right bring It full circle you look at the at the book of Nehemiah at the beginning Nehemiah knew listen this wasn't going to happen overnight it was going to take years but it was worth it so the the time element doesn't matter it's worth it hey man what my my wasn't worried about criticism listen the reason I read this at the beginning the the Bible tells us not just there but other places you look at Tobias and Samba man they they just raked Nehemiah over the coals they looked at the wall they were building and at one point they looked and said you know what if a fox would run up that wall the wall would fall over that wall that can't even hold him a fox a stiff window knocked that thing over but you know what it didn't look impressive to them but Nehemiah he called on the name of the Lord Lord you take away our approach Lord you be our help and the bottles of the people joined together they had a mind to work and they built that wall and you know what happened they get to where they're finished up the wall the critics they suddenly get a little worried yes I'm no other way ah that was nothing they don't know what they're doing now the sudden they're oh boy our Mean Tweets haven't stopped them from building are hurtful words haven't stopped the work we've tried to we've tried to instigate problems we've tried to cause trouble we've made fun of them called every kind of name in the book called them holy rollers and they still build it and now it's about done what are we gonna do you ain't gonna do nothing you can do nothing you were unable to do nothing and you still can't do anything that's why the work of God remains Satan and the powers of Darkness he cannot stop you because you come from God and you're going back to God the critics their mouths get shot when God begins to do the work and now they're sitting there I love this because the Bible says all the Heathen that were around about Jerusalem they begin to look down on the enemies of Nehemiah because they saw the work that God was with them listen God will humiliate your enemies hey man when even the unbeliever can look at your life and say God did something there no man could do that amen why am I just a matter of time it's just just be patient it's just a matter of time to your enemy realizes it doesn't matter he can't stop it he can't do anything to you amen there's nothing he can do to stop God there's nothing he can do to stop you start the work God started he's gonna finish it hey man just stand to your feet just bow your heads for a moment I want you to maybe look in your own life and you can think of the different times that you lost patience God or yourself maybe you're in that situation today you're getting ready to go to church or whatever it is think about all the times you've failed God think about all the things that you haven't done think about how how inadequate you are thinking about how unworthy you are but that's not what he said about you he testified that you're worthy through the blood of Christ he testified of your Valley when he purchased you with the blood of Jesus Christ he testifies today of your worth with his patience that he's shown toward you God likes you God designed you with an intent God designed you with a purpose you're valuable in God's sight take all your misgivings take all your insecurity and just throw it back on the enemy say you know what Nehemiah he was sent Letters by the enemy he said listen I don't have time for that I don't have time to talk to the enemy the work is too great you don't have time today to negotiate and talk with the Enemy you let them know you know what the work of God which I am a work of God I'm a part of the work of God it's too important to entertain your criticisms it's too important to entertain misgivings it's too important God has designed me with a purpose God has given me a vision my desire your desire today let it be let us rise up above criticism let's rise up above misgivings let's rise up above the hurt that we've gone through let's rise up above our our tragedies and let us build we're going to set ourselves to build this good work it's worth it it's worth it Saints it's worth everything we could give to him He's Worthy he's worthy let's pray oh Lord you're worthy today Lord I don't regret one mile I walked for you Lord there's no no prayer that I pray that I regret Lord there's no there's no time nothing I've given to you that I look back and wish I could take back Lord my my only regret in life is I haven't given you more on the desires I want to give you more Lord that's our desire today I believe for every sincere Christian here today Lord we just want to devote ourselves more to the work but we want to we want to be patient with you we want to be patient with ourselves with our brother our sister sitting next to us Lord there's a there's a purpose in that life there were when you made that life there was an intention in your mind something that each one of us would fulfill and Lord if we could just come into a Unity of that purpose or that intention I believe there'd be divine Harmony in the world the very Redemption of the earth is resting upon the manifestation of the sons of God Lord Your Divine architect we we look at the creation we look at your works we look at the very stars that are hung in the sky everything in a perfect timing perfect harmony not one microsecond of a deviation we look at the creation and we bear witness today great is thy faithfulness We join with all nature and manifold Witness to your great faithfulness Lord we
