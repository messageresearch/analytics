ought to be the happiest people in the world you know our happiness and our joy it's not what the world has given to us the bible is true it says happy are the people who's god is the lord amen that's a happiness that comes from knowing him knowing who we are knowing what he's done knowing what he's doing in our life that's a that's a real joy it sustains us it gives us strength and man through each moment of our journey amen let's just let's just bow our hearts before the lord here once again if we could if you have a need on your heart tonight maybe you just want to make it known to the lord say lord just pass by my way tonight amen god bless you tonight heavenly father lord without you lord jesus as the songwriter could write and we hear the lovely words of our lord and savior without you we can do nothing father we are standing lord as your children lord tonight lord in need of you lord not only as speaker lord but as a hearer we're in need of the grace of god to come among us tonight lord that father you would move lord down for every need that lord you would lift us beyond this physical address lord may we move into that place god of such an awareness that we are in the presence of almighty god and these petitions lord that we have on our hearts needs and desires things lord that god you've reserved to this moment in this service to speak so personally to our hearts it may not be lord something that would be new to us lord lord you have a way of bringing out lord god of the treasures of your word lord just so lord magnifying it and speaking to our lives presently lord so father we just we lord lay ourselves open before you lord we ask that god your presence it's here that lord we're just so thankful lord a place that we can come and gather in worship

you that you just come lord speak to our hearts now we pray minister to every need may the spirit of god just move so freely among us the lord we pray granted lord in jesus preciously amen amen if you turn with me in the bible to psalms 27 i'd like to go there just for a few moments okay i'd like to read at verse seven if you go to that to that place david said here oh lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou satist seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over unto the will of my enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty and i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living mr verses i want to just draw our attention to this verse wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord amen i'd just like to speak just a few moments on that thought on weight on the lord may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i wonder if you also wouldn't turn with me i don't have it up there but if you'll turn with me to isaiah chapter 40 and i had it in there a little bit further down but i'm just going to go ahead and read that and perhaps pick up on that here in isaiah chapter 40 and verse verse 28. or 27. why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord my judgment is passed over from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youths shall faint and be weary the young men shall utterly fail so we see even in this scripture that even to have strength of youthfulness is not enough to stand even in this hour there needs to be a greater strength now notice verse 31 we'll draw from there but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength now this is not a question if it will happen but the bible says they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength and you see god places it in such a way that you and i would know not only how but that to come into a place that we are waiting on the lord in other words there's a certainty you know it's like any of you that have went you've traveled on an airplane or maybe some of you traveled on a bus or you you've been in places that you know you need to be at this certain gate or this place at a certain time because that's where the departure or the flight or where this is going to be see god announces in his word just as much and that's those things we know in the natural a gate where a flight's going to take place anybody who's flown you flies at all you know that can change in a heartbeat you can be sitting there and they can move it clear to another terminal so that there's no certainty in that but there is a certainty in god's word to where when god has made a promise that we can wait on the lord and we when we wait on the lord then we will come his provided approach his way and when we come according to his way and his approach under his leading then it's all his working and so we can have a confidence god would lay out in his word that there's a certainty that we're waiting on the lord so let me read that in verse 31 again but they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint so if we can ever look at it in a time in our life as we're thinking about in communion in prayer and in our lives as we walk daily with the lord if there ever is a time in an hour of a people that would be in need of a renewing it would truly be the people of god in this hour we we have such a precious promise from the word of god that not only is the baptism of the holy ghost it's one feeling but there is many many refillings and we need that we need a continual refilling of the holy ghost and so when we're looking at this waiting on the lord there's a certainty that comes from the presence of god and i think in a day in an age that we are living in we are constantly taxed with uh that of impatience all around us uh we want things coming and moving in such a quick pace it's almost like we can't take it when the lights are red and oh now it's the turn signal to go green and all of the things that are around us and you realize that things that are there those stop lights have been there for how long but the things that we even have around us that wants to further put that pressure where we can at the at just a few few fingers we can look something up and all of a sudden you know and then if it's not coming up we're looking at the come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on now i know i'm not the only one that feels that way sometimes and you think oh no do i have to go you know the route or the or unplug this and plug this back up because you're expecting when you look something up that it's going to come up there but yet all of those things that move in such a way of of instant instant instant and it puts us in a way that sometimes we get in that we get in that frame framework of how we're looking for god to come on the scene and fulfill the promises of his word you know there's things that we can we can look at and say well this is the time or this is the moment but god holds every season in his hand god holds that in his hand and even the season of when god will give an answer to the promises that he has given and made to us i want to read this this quote here tonight i'll refer to others but i want to read this and brother branham is talking about of communion and this is out of the message remembering the lord he says one of many times i've wondered if that when we use the if we don't use the word just right of communion commune means to talk to to commune with and i wonder if really when we meet together like this in heavenly places if that isn't if if that isn't communion that we are communing with god and talking to him now if you remember things that we even had spoke on before where brother adam will say in the same year he'll speak of even when you come to listen to a minister giving his message you're not communing with that minister but when we come to the house of god we're here to commune with god but our communion is not limited to here but we are here to the petitions and the desires that we have were here that god would minister to the very needs of our life we're here in a place to be sensitive to hear from god and you know think of god in his mercy when brother branham would stand there on the platform and he could see a person they were getting ready to miss what god was actually speaking to them and he said oh god help me help me lord give me their name lest they miss that you are speaking to them see sometimes it's in a place notice the grace of god that god would call that person's name out setting in the audience so that they might recognize that god what he's speaking to it's them personally and when we come to set here we come to commune with god there's questions there's needs there's desires there are and all of it has to do with the promises that god has made concerning our lives what he's given in his word and we're here to commune with him we're here to to have fellowship we're here to hear from almighty god and so when we look at this brother man goes on and he says he says if we would just sit still and let him answer us back and he said many things many things one of the horrible things that i do i try to do all the talking and not sit still long enough for him to answer me back and we do that so many times in prayer that what's our voice we're the ones talking now notice what he says here i think if we would get off of our heart what's in it and express ourselves to the lord jesus and then just kneel and just be still a while and just see what he would say back to us because prayer is communion remember as we've been looking at entering in to fellowship with god and coming into that place of communion because ultimately it's god's desire true fellowship is under the blood of jesus christ where that life has come back upon us and there has been a transformation and the communion is not somewhere out there but it has now come into that place in the very soul of man where god can speak to that life god can commune with our lives think of it adam in the beginning could not have fellowship with the monkeys he couldn't have fellowship with the elephants adam could only have fellowship with one of his kind and god can only disclose his heart his secrets to his bride because nobody else would want to know those things but he discloses his heart to those who have a desire to know him to walk with him to please him and god unfolds himself to the believer and there is a union between the believer and christ to where we're no longer twain but we are one and there's a restoring of that communion which is the fellowship inside of man now when we so when we're looking at jew to just be still for a while and and we can all say amen to this that we are in a time of busyness or it can be busy and life can become so busy and you become so occupied and to where even when you have your moments and your time you feel i'm just wore out i'm just depleted is that right and whether it's physically or mentally there is a lot there's a lot of pressure and even from the toils and tasks of life to where that within it that it would cause us to to just you know move around ever so quickly but notice the scripture and i always when i i think of the scripture here in james 1 where the scripture says let every man be swift to hear i always think of what brother john lafontaine always spoke he said god gave you two ears and one mouth not two mouth and one ear god gave us that for a reason to be swift to hear so hearing is to be before the speaking and to know that how that god would so so arrange that that so many times for us to listen and that scripture goes on to say slow to peak slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god every one of us here no doubt at some time have tried to finish our wife's statement or our husband's statement we know exactly where they're going and yet we don't i wasn't going there i wasn't going in that direction but we're so quick to go this way or i think i and everything we're so quick to respond to something when that is totally contrary to the things of god it is true we are to be as the bible would say quit quit be strong like man but that means to stand resolute with faith upon god's promise not to act in haste there's times of haste where we move on the promise of god god has made this promise and we take it but yet there are there are the times in our life as the scriptures so many would say wait on the lord that it's not in our in our interest or in god's desire that we would move so hastily to where we're moving without real solid authority notice brother branham was speaking in this same same quote about about being in prayer for things in our lives he said sometimes he's speaking of what we just read there if we would just kneel and be still for a while sometimes he says i've done that and my whole opinion was changed see one thing i love about brother branham he's very honest he's very transparent he doesn't say i've always done that he just said it in the quote above one of the horriblest things i do come on friends and even right here he says and sometimes i've done that because there's also the pressures of life that come just stick with me sometimes i've done that and my whole opinion has changed i'd go ask him something now lord these people really they got something i i believe they want me over here and i just start praying and first thing you know i'm just satisfied that that's the lord's will but after i pray if i just linger a little while then it's changed my but how many times after that well yeah i just started praying and i just feel like it's god's will praise god get the bags packed can't call the mortgage come all these things and yet we haven't lingered to see what does god say about it we're living in a world which always has been where man has went by feelings the fall took place because of what satan was able to project to eve a word that was contrary to the word of god and remember how brother rabbi spoke of it he touched her he began to speak to her and her mind imagination come everything was moved by feelings and feeling there's nothing wrong with feelings but the church of the living god does not walk by feelings we walk by faith not feelings because sometimes our feelings we have to always check our feelings and one of the ways that the prophet is laying this out right here is to check that that after he's prayed and my just such a no doubt a wonderful atmosphere but he's lingered a little bit because that lingering is speaking to god lord what do you say about this i'm leaning this way but what do you say about it you see all together he says sometimes somewhere else just commune with the lord and oh what a glorious fellowship just to get get down and talk and commune and wait for him to talk back how many say help me lord help me lord and wait for him to talk back absolutely wait for him to talk back and to think notice brother brown goes on to say this and to think of what a great person that is you're talking to that that's a powerful statement what a great person that you're talking to we're talking to the king of kings and the lord of lords there there's there's no such thing as a secretary in heaven this isn't the second man in charge this is god himself great person that we would have an audience with a privilege that even he would speak to us and say ask ask an opening ask ask ask and think what a great person that is you're talking to the creator himself and communing with him who put your life in this volcanic ash that you're living in and then someday you'll have to leave there and then it's in his hands where it goes from there you have the privilege now to make your choice which way that soul goes when it leaves and what a wonderful thing to commune with him upon the basis of his promises then hear him commune back to you and say it's all well that really expresses it right we don't have to look to a creed we're not looking to dogmas only thing we have to do is just know that he witnesses back his word and it's settled then the burdens roll away i think that that's this is i read this right here and it just suppresses upon my heart to think of it when we are communing with god wait on the lord and be of good courage when god makes known his promise to our life personally we've got assurance that we can wait and have an expectation on god to come and fulfill that promise we can commune with him on the basis of his promise you realize brother graham says that has a life you know a life can try to quit drinking or quit smoking and brother branham he just says it so plainly in a manner he says with all those things he said you must believe the whole thing lays in faith he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has already passed from death unto life he said do you believe that's the truth there isn't nothing else that you can do but only believe and if you believe then the little immoral things will drop off as you believe you become love and love is god and you begin to wind yourself into christ and these other things you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves because there's no more desire to do it you wind yourself into him you're becoming love see you're fellowshipping upon the promises of god the promise that god has made in this hour let's take back in luther's day they could commune with god upon the promise of that just shall live by faith in wesley's day commune with the blood that sanctifies in that of pentecost they could commune with the promise of to think of the restoration of the gifts the coming of the holy spirit to think at this hour you and i are communing and can commune with god upon that promise of the holy ghost on the seal of the living god you see god has made promises to you and i and made them so real that we can commune and talk to god about these things we're communing with god about the promise of the rapture even so come lord jesus there's a communion going on there's a back and forth what god is disclosing but it's on the basis of his promise and notice all of these bases as we speak of as you're communing with him and upon the basis of his word what god is speaking to your heart no matter where you're at here tonight there is a communion that can take place and god's desire is for it to move down into the very depths of your life if it's not there yet are you hearing me there's a word that god has given you can commune upon the basis of his promise the basis is coming under the blood as the word is speaking to us us surrendering and us looking to god and praying over these things and i just it just kind of keeps on coming back around if you don't commune upon the basis of the promises you won't go nowhere you've got to commune upon the basis of his promises not just come to the house of god and say my that was a wonderful touch but that touch should stimulate you to commune on the basis of the promises of almighty god and look for and answer god's witness to come back upon your life because as you commune on it and be honest with him there's things in your life sin and habits and unbelief he will dissolve those things he will clean it out as you will commune with him upon the promise i think it's fitting because we look in the scripture the bible would say in the book of hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not terry you know think about when we're looking at patients and that's a that's a great that's a great big one right there you think about patience think about time and talking you know in your home and every everybody has you know like i said time things sometimes things could be crunch time or whatever more but can you imagine and let's just take talking to the lord and put it in a manner as like we would talk to our spouse or our children and say you know what okay i've got about 10 minutes here and so come on come on just just cut cut to the chase let's go stop i don't need all the background just cut to the chase on this wow you would find you know you know what you would find never mind we'll talk about it later right all right she's not interested it wouldn't he wouldn't go anywhere and see it's not something that we say sometimes you don't have to say it it's demeanor of your body but think about it to god that god can speak and know even within our spirit of where we're at and you know here we're stirred and you know the first thing to do is you know what lord i just need to get settled i just need to get quiet sometimes we're wanting an answer and we look like a troubled sea and we're wanting god to sit down on a troubled sea and sometimes we're thinking well if i go to put on music or if i do this that's going to take time but that very moment of conditioning our heart to come into a place of communion to where you could spend 40 minutes and the sea is just bubbling and shaking or you can take that time and let your spirit get set alright and begin to think about him and just worship him and invite him to come and in just a few moments of time that right there is real communion with him so we don't want to put god on a schedule lord you can talk to me but you've got to fit it in in this time but you see this is the blessedness of community because communion itself to a believer when we have come back into fellowship with god it is not something that's reserved to just a thursday night a sunday morning or a designated time in a prayer closet but in we become available or should allow ourselves and to be available that at any moment that he desires to speak to us that he's welcome he's able to come and to speak to us that's the fulfillment of praying without ceasing it's not just confined to just like traditional moments but when we look at it think of one of these ways because i could say for everybody here we've all prayed and we've waited for answers let me just say it to you like this sometimes waiting on your knees you could wait there and you might wait to the early morning hours and you've not got no answer you see communion is is where you're in a place to where god is able to answer in whatever manner he chooses it's to become sensitive to his voice now watch how brother branham takes this because you're in prayer and he talks about simeon we know that simeon here was the bible says he was a devout man and he was waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him he was waiting and brother branham puts it brother puts it in this manner this is a way to approach this he's saying simeon who is our character tonight something just told him to sit down a little while just sit down a little while and he says you know brother ramsay says we are going so fast sometimes we ought to set down just a little while phones aside ipads aside hello just sit down for a little while we ought to sit down we run and say a little prayer for me mama papa children jump up right quick and we don't stay down there long enough for god to talk back to us we do all the talking and we don't give god a chance to talk somebody called somebody was talking one time and they were you know it wasn't anybody here so don't nobody go looking around but somebody told i never heard this term given to anybody but you know they were talking about you know this one that one they said yeah when you're when you fellowship with them they ain't fellowship it's domination they just dominate the conversation so they call dominators come on [Laughter] he just dominated man they got the floor uh-huh wow wow my yeah yeah well i wonder sometimes if we don't do that to god we dominate the camera i got to get this out i got to get that out i forgot to pray about this and there are so many needs and requests to pray about let alone looking in our own lives but like brother graham said if we could just get what's on our heart get it out and then just sit still instead of looking at prayer as though it's something that of like a list and i've got to get through this and if i don't get through this if i don't pray for brother bill or i don't pray for brother brian or i don't pray for so-and-so and this mean if i if i don't do that listen we are a body let me tell you something if i had every need i'd have to write it down on a notepad but there are times those needs listen i hope you don't get offended they don't come up right before me when i'm in prayer there's other needs that come up what do you do i go right to that need and i begin to pray to that need that drops in my heart because what i've learned is that not only when i'm on my knees or laying on my face there in my office i've learned that god will speak to me on the roadways or maybe i'm in the store and another need comes up i pray for it right there because right there is where it drops in my heart hallelujah oh glory be to god notice he says we do all the talking and we don't give god a chance to talk i want you to watch how brother brown has expressed this with simeon i love this he said simeon just waited and he sat down in one of those priest office and he closed the door and locked himself in he said all of a sudden he said i can see simeon reach and pick up the scripture the brotherhood said you know the holy spirit feeds on the word of god that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god he said that's what's a matter with the church that's what makes the church in its anemic condition is because it doesn't take time to feed on the word of god the church is hungry so to feed on now feeding is much different than listening but feeding is where you're taking it in and just laying yourself open before the word of god and allowing god just to speak to your life you know you might be walking around you might be exercising you might be doing other things you might sit right in front of of you know while that's being played but the main thing is is that you're feeding on the word of god say brother samuel what are you saying i'm saying don't let it be a religion that i've got to listen to one message a day that's religion be a feeder on the word because you could listen to it and be a critic of everybody else but if you feed on it that word changes you we're taking because notice an anemic condition is a lack of blood like i was talking to a brother the other day and he was talking about you know it doesn't go here but another minister in another place and he's talking about how that you know they were having you know he says i don't even crave chicken no more he said i don't crave it no more he said the only thing he said i'll crave his beef i said you know why you're craving that because you're low in iron you can eat chicken all day long but chicken don't have the iron to put into you you got to eat red meat well i feel like a steak right now all right chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken but you got to eat red meat put more on the menu honey or answer and it's an anemic condition it's got to be the living word of god to feed on that word to feast on it to pray over it to commune with god of the things that we are hearing and that we are receiving brother graham said you went to a doctor and that doctor you know looking at this big old stout looking man and said sir i'm sick he said well what's your symptoms well he said i'm just so weak i can't hardly pick my hands up he would ask him some some of the conditions and he would begin to say are you eating regular well i eat a half a cracker day before yesterday you're just hungry you need strength and you need to eat he said that's what's a matter with the church we just read a scripture a little verse on sunday morning and we ought to have our head in this word every minute we have to spare take a lot of times and laying something else aside to read that word you see laying something else aside there's always something to be put in its place is that right i mean you know you don't have to look around your house or your life to try to find things to do right it's always like saying i'm not going to do this this week that'll be next week and when i get the next week i'll make sure i moved it to the following week you just change the date on your reminders and it automatically kicks it down but you see there's always something there to try to take its place this is where as simeon in that moment as brother brown would dramatize that he set steel and he picked up a scroll brother bram said he began to pick up isaiah 9 and 6 and he began to read over that scroll that was a promise that god even had revealed thou shalt not die until that seed the lord's christ see what's he doing as he's being sensitive now he's feeding upon the promise that has already been revealed to him and as he's feeding upon that promise at about that time brother braham said the holy spirit spoke to him and said stand up get up out of your seat open the door and walk on out there where i'm going to lead you you see he received an answer he was looking to god he was praying he was waiting on god what was he praying about he was praying about what had already been revealed to him he wasn't praying oh i hope i don't miss it oh i hope i don't miss it when he comes oh no no that's not how he's praying wait on the lord be of a good courage and he will strengthen thine heart he was not praying in a manner of oh i might miss it i don't know that's uncertainty he's praying god has revealed this to me what did prayer do prayer keeps him in an atmosphere of contact with god to where god can say at any time stand up and walk out there because prayer is nevertheless not my will thine will be done glory be to god thou will be done on earth even as it is in heaven now notice in this scripture that we've referred to many many times out of matthew 6 when thou prayest enter into that closet and when thou shut the door pray to the father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly the bible would say in james 4 7-8 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded so the promise is draw not to god and he will draw nigh unto us now when you you consider even the the promises of the word of god we recognize that we can so close the door to where that your meditation and everything it becomes on the things of god now you know we would love i would love to think i you know i've been in times where meditation because meditation is part of prayer as well to where it's just it's just moved then throughout the day that no matter then where where i'm going it's just just how things just continue to drop and just communing with god and there's always then there's times and moments and things and you know you want to so guard that because you don't want that channel broken but then there's times when there's things you got to deal with in life that comes up and the channel it can be a little interrupted but it is but it isn't stopped up you come into a place and how god is able to move right back down and speak right to your heart but it's an opportunity it's a blessed time and an opportunity having fellowship with almighty god that god would speak to us and speak to us about his word the things that we're hearing even as god is ministering the things we're hearing in the message as we're taking them in and just just meditating on those things praying about those things like with simeon there when simeon himself he he picked up that of isaiah 9 6 and brother brown said here was he here's what came out of simeon oh i wonder who he could be talking about in isaiah 9 and 6. you see there was a relationship it wasn't just print he was communing it was meditating there's things that god says in in a way that would open you and i out to where that we're able and we would sit there and just take in what god is saying think of these scriptures here i i'm going to just refer to these scriptures here very quickly we've we've talked about them quite quite a bit and there's more to be said about them but think of just just when's the last time that we've just sat down just to listen to a message i mean i i can answer that but i'm talking about just to sit down just to just to just to listen just to pray let me just say it like this in our homes i can speak to parents those are coming up and so forth don't let the voice of the prophet be a foreign thing in your home brother samuel i listen to the message but let that i can tell you right now when there was a youth meeting here about back it was back in november and i took it we took a little thought and i just i played i played exactly what i was dealing with on choices and decisions and i played a clip from souls in prison now of how the prophet they're going to hell and that vision of hell and i played that i'm telling you there was an anointing came in to that living room we had service that night it didn't stop even after everybody left we had service right there that night you say brother samuel what are you saying there is an anointing upon the word of god it should not be a foreign thing you say are you telling me to be purposeful i'm telling you that if we let every other thing go on and things be played in our house it ought to be that the voice of the prophet of god should not be a foreign substance in our house you ought to be a conscious effort because listen we are under the effect not of a kentuckian's voice we're under the influence of the voice of almighty god in this hour amen we need to give that priority we need to have that time is that right we must just just set back and just behold just behold the bible says that the lord is that spirit and we are changed from glory unto glory even as by the spirit though as we are beholding in a glass as we're looking in and taking into account of our own lives there's a changing that's going on as we're yielding to him that's a communing that's a communing that's going on this is why even the scripture and i just referred to this over the months out of psalms 27 4 of what david's speaking that he had desired and the one the thing that david said that he would do is to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple now in these scriptures alone it requires us being still it requires us being still it requires us looking into now understand what i'm saying by still i'm talking about being still in here laying aside all the things of the busyness and things that god help me help me with everything that we have going on and i know i'm speaking right down where we live tonight because there's this because with life itself whether we like it there's more responsibilities that come everything within life life itself is of responsibility and to just be able to step back and just to just to really just to take account let the word of god just speak into our lives not just here in church but outside a church mom dad you need to be in the message well brother samuel i you know listen there's no excuse we can have you have it right on your phone and you see you can say well i don't understand everything but don't let that don't let the enemy give you that excuse just get into the message put it on listen to listen to what god has spoke to us in this hour allow it to change your life i'm not speaking of something i'm not i don't know about when god got a hold of my life i laid in that message i put on tape after tape after tape did i understand everything no but it was life that was in there i just availed myself put it on put it on put it on put it on put it on in the car i kept putting it on avail myself because and there was something there was a hunger a desire for the word of god and you're feeding on that word it brings change there's relationship there's communion that takes place there's things to pray about my much much more that we can say within that but just our life you know we can this isn't us trying to do things but it's but it's our lives yielded to god it's our lives being yielded to god being open to the lord being yielded to his life in his presence he will bring the promise to pass if we'll yield ourselves to him see this is this is where brother brown could say if you'll just stay close to god just love him just live for him live a pure holy life live and pray every day keep yourself refreshed in his presence and god will take care of the rest of it it's staying refreshed in his presence remember the scripture i'm coming down here when aaron's rod was taken and placed into the whole list of homies it's when it got into the presence of almighty god that what it was all along become manifest it was an almond branch the whole time but when he got into the presence of god you see going in there would dissolve all doubts it would end every dispute it would it would it would quench every battle and it would take that in there and in just a 24-hour period of time that rod would bud blossom and produce almonds now let's just be honest that's just how quick it is when you can get into the friends of god how quick that god can change your life it's just how quick that god can change our attitude our outlook in a situation just getting into his presence if we can just put our life into his hands getting in his presence like brother brown said at first i felt like man i'm going to go and take this meeting but the more as i prayed and i waited and lingered a little longer everything changed what was it just dwelling in his presence just sit there and just soak it up and say what is it lord that you say about this you see the church world they're the ones telling god what they want i want the blood and i want this but i don't want him telling me how to dress i don't want to tell me how to live i don't want there they're the ones telling him this is what we'll do but don't you touch our lives don't you require any of this other stuff but we believe in the blood see they tell god what to do they tell god we're going to do this we're going to go do this and we're going to go do that brother graham tells us in perfect strength he said so many times he talked about people setting up tents and everything he said so many times people go and they do things in their own strength and any time we ever do anything in our own strength it ends in frustration because we're looking for results and we're not getting them because it's our strength but it's not our strength that god uses it's our life yielded to him it's his strength that's perfect it's his strength and moves through the church of the living god and his strength is his word the holy ghost made manifest and in the lives of the people it's that alive moving through when it got into his when he got into the friends of god it changed that rod it blossomed it budded it yielded almonds you know god gave a promise to israel he gave it to to jacob he also gave the same isaac spoke of this to esau too but remember esau could care less about all that was said but something that god told jacob it might seem so small so minuscule but it's a great blessing and he said in genesis 27 28 god give thee the dew of heaven i wish i could really preach on that right now but god give you the dew of heaven the dew itself it falls in silence it settles down in the night but the dew doesn't come during the day it comes at night when everything gets quiet gets settled and it's at peace this dew of promise many scriptures but god would make a promise i will give to thee the dew of heaven because it's the dew of heaven after that rain has went forth in the beginning the dew that would come upon herman the dew upon mount zion the dew upon the land of israel that would bring the refreshment to the seed that had been planted and the seed would come forth under the refreshment and the dew itself is a place of quietness it's a place of rest the dew brother would bring it in and type it is what falls in the holiest of wholeness it's the presence of god that moves down upon our lives and brings a real refreshing it's a do that brings a change in our life now think of this this do something that could be looked at and scoffed at and looked down on but this do is what would bring a refreshing to a life this do is what would bring a renewing to a life let me just leave you with this brother branham says in the message elisha the prophet i don't have it up there just just listen he says oh he says that early morning when the dew settles down there's something about the quietness of the night alone the dew falls and it freshens if we could only get quiet and alone with god how that do would strengthen us it would take the wilt out of us and make us fresh how many of you ever went out in a rose garden or you went out among flowers in the morning there's such a fragrance that's there lilies honeysuckles all the just there's an you can set on your porch i think about at times even at our other house i would sit on the porch and sometimes even just have my window open right there in the morning and all of a sudden that it was just just that fragrance of those lilac bushes that i had planted in different places around the house it was just oh it was so it was such a fresh smell and it would come from the morning you see it's the dew that would fall and the manna would fall upon the dew remember it was the dew that gideon said lord if you want me to go in this way let the dew fall upon the fleece then he would put the fleece out again and said let the fleece be dry and the dew fall around the dew brought answer to get in it brought it was a quietness it settled it you see with that quietness even when we look at the dew of the holy ghost falling into a life it doesn't mean that that person is alive and they're just setting you know lifeless but there is a something that brother brahm says it falls into our life that we know we know the person can say well they really got something and maybe they really didn't get something all the way down into their soul are you hearing me then there's other times you can say well i don't know about but remember when the dew moves down to the inside it's the dew that brings change in that place of surrender and refreshing the brand says oh he's talking about getting out among them flowers he said oh i said god in the run of the day and in the run of the days if i get all wilty and indifferent let me lay in your presence in the quietness alone with you then i come out fresh again anybody say yes lord if i get wilty and indifferent let me just go lay in your presence lord jesus oh he might have said that's what god wants to do with a fragrance of prayer all over us covered by the blood of the lord jesus how fresh we are before the angels then how fresh we are in the presence of almighty god wait on the lord and he will strengthen thine heart oh my i'm glad he's there to take the wilt out of our life he's there to strengthen us he's there to give just exactly what we have need of all that we have to do is approach him on the basis of his word and commune with him let's pray heavenly father lord god i realize tonight lord as we look into your word i'm so glad the lord we have a privilege that we can lord commune with you lord lord to know that that communion lord it's not something of a tradition help us lord forgive us when we've made it a tradition the lord the reality lord god of your desire is that lord it's a communion that at any time lord to meditate to speak to your lord to talk to you to be available then lord that you can speak to us lord no doubt there's many many different needs lord i know these things are not new to us but lord how that you would just sometimes lord you have a way of sweeping right back around to remind us lord of the simple things help us lord in an age of pressure an age of hurry hurry hurry and age lord that god when as your children receive deadlines for things to be completed projects to be done things to be turned in and when they receive it those that deliver it want it done yesterday lord god we find pressure we find things all around us it's a time oh god where even lord god and our spirit and our mind we can grow weary lord we can grow weary and you would speak to us that be not weary in well-doing for we shall reap [Music] we shall reap it we shall reap we shall receive help us lord i pray god may lord i pray the simplicity lord of your word [Music] lord god lives in hearts that may be gathered here tonight or will listen to this lord whatever the promise might be if it's a need lord upon alive [Music] lord god for the holy ghost may they commune take lord god as you have given us tonight in your word and commune on the basis of that promise or god or god to invite you to talk with you lord to pour their lives out before you lord god for decisions lord that are to be made in lives and we all have decisions that's lord always right before us lord god i can say lord god just like the prophet said it is a horrible thing [Music] lord sometimes feeling the pressure the lord god help us lord help us to get stupid help us to remember the value of this lord god help us lord i pray lord i know all it it takes is just lord even in that time seeing that lord then when situations would come about again that would be very similar we can recognize if i could just get settled i can just get steel in his presence begin to worship him maybe singing putting on some soft music some good gospel music and begin to sing begin to worship him oh lord god that's part of worship that's part of communion lord it's a desire to enter in just like lord as a husband a wife with family we don't want to just barge in lord god lord sometimes lord it takes a warming up to one another to begin to talk begin to break down the barriers of life of time help us lord lord we need your help lord we need your leadership lord god may our lives lord what a precious promise that our lives lord we can be refreshed renewed in your presence lord oh god i thank you for that tonight lord what a precious precious privilege we have lord to be refreshed to get steel to get along with you lord god [Music] oh lord jesus help us help us to be that sensitive lord recognizing of those times that maybe lord when there's seemingly been connection that's been lost and we sense that lord may we lord god i pray and really put that initiative in to get along with you lord god to get along with you your prophet said sometimes he would go drive down the back roads till he would get a loan all to himself but he put that in to get along i realized lord that every day of our life we can't go out on the back road somewhere but lord may we stay in that place of fellowship of communion and when we sense the things lord just aren't right just like it would be between a husband and a wife lord god or a family it would call together a conference [Music] love would do that that's what drives for fellowship help us father i pray granted lord strengthen your children lord god may they recognize lord that father even when they're driving down the roadway that god they can be right in communion with you when they're right there on the job lord they can be right in communion with you lord walking through the store iron the clothes they can be right in fellowship and communion with you lord god lord jesus how we thank you for your mercy lord [Music] know around me [Music] jesus [Music] hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] jesus [Music] draw me closer lord [Music] fade away [Music] closer lord to you [Music] he wants me [Music] i want to there's just no love i could never ever [Music] [Applause] [Music] until there is just no more oh [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh it's in the press [Music] [Music] oh my god oh hallelujah yes lord jesus for he's my friends [Music] oh [Music] of the kingston [Music] [Music] must be something [Music] oh [Music] oh there must be something more within that only he can see i pray to the lord take all of my life i give it [Music] let's sing it once again [Music] i give it all to [Music] every day that you'll come here [Music] amen what a what a comfort god always always answers god always answers sometimes he doesn't answer in the way or if even what sometimes we're expecting [Music] but if anything that we can glean from this say lord help me to let me close off any channels there's things that you've prayed about you've prayed and you're waiting on god god can come through many different avenues i've witnessed i've witnessed how god would bring a brother and stand right here that has only stood here once in his life first time standing and just just a question just something i had on my heart and i've watched how god has come and taken that gift and spoke directly and he didn't call it out word for word but it would be the answer [Music] to what i was praying about i'm not the only one who's had that witness of how god has taken that sometimes god will use the pastor sometimes god will use another gift sometimes god can use a
