[9:04] Heavenly Father, we just come before

[9:12] I got to thinking today, Father, this
[9:14] world is so evil and this this world is
[9:16] truly ready for a tribulation, God. But
[9:19] Lord, that means that there's a bride
[9:21] ready for rapture, oh Lord. And you you

[9:30] to your prophet, God. And and Brother
[9:32] Brandham said, "People have just got so
[9:34] much amnesia. They they got away and
[9:36] they forgot, oh Lord, for they forgot
[9:38] about Calvary. They forgot about you
[9:40] coming down to save them, oh Lord. But
[9:42] but you sent a word, prophet, Father,
[9:44] and that that you may reveal your word
[9:48] to us, oh God, and and not leave us
[9:50] stranded. And father, I just pray for
[9:52] brother Samuel in the back as he he
[9:54] prepares to deliver the word, Father.
[9:56] That you just anoint his lips and allow
[9:58] him to get himself out of the way,
[9:59] Father. And that you just anoint the
[10:01] hearts of each and every one of us,
[10:02] Father, that we can receive your word.
[10:04] And we pray for each and every one of
[10:06] these requests, Father, for the lost
[10:08] loved ones, Father. It It's not too hard
[10:10] for you, Lord. And Father, we we just
[10:13] put this service into your hands. And in
[10:15] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, buddy. Amen. God

[10:22] tonight. Amen. You have to forgive me
[10:25] tonight. My uh my phone wasn't able to

[27:30] where we may not know the moment and we
[27:33] may not. There's one thing we know. We

[33:34] of thanksgiving?
[33:37] Thank you, Lord.
[33:39] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[33:42] Praise the Lord.
[33:45] Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of
[33:47] prayer here.
[33:49] Heavenly Father,
[33:52] my
[33:54] how sweet is your presence, Lord.
[33:58] How precious you are, Lord.
[34:02] Oh God, as
[34:05] writers moved by the spirit of God,
[34:09] how that you had touched their lives,
[34:11] Lord, even down through the Old
[34:13] Testament, they would write under that
[34:17] inspiration.
[34:19] Great adjectives, Lord, great
[34:21] descriptives,
[34:24] &gt;&gt; lily of the valley, on and on and on.
[34:27] But it would all speak of the one
[34:29] self-same person.
[34:32] That's you, Lord Jesus.
[34:35] Oh God,
[34:37] how we're so thankful, Father.
[34:41] That Lord, as we find you to be
[34:44] [Music]
[34:45] all things to us, Lord, you're all that
[34:48] we have need of
[34:51] God. No matter the situation,
[34:53] you showed it all the way down through
[34:55] the Old Testament that no matter what
[34:57] situation arose
[35:00] as you would reveal
[35:03] another one of the compound redemptive
[35:06] names that you were God
[35:09] to meet the need in that situation
[35:13] that Lord, as we've gathered here
[35:14] tonight, there's needs, Lord, that we
[35:16] have.
[35:19] We're a needy people, Lord. We're not
[35:21] ashamed to say that we need you Lord.
[35:26] It's not just about Lord different
[35:28] requests that we would have although we
[35:31] have many needs among us Lord but we
[35:34] need more of you
[35:36] and we want more of you Lord.
[35:40] Oh God
[35:42] when Lord you've touched our hearts Lord
[35:44] and you've moved in our lives there just
[35:46] something about it Lord we just can't
[35:48] get enough of you Lord. Hallelujah.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; We want to be more and more like you,
[35:54] Lord. We want to be, Lord, just just
[35:58] that oneness, Lord, in our lives would
[36:00] grow. More of the grace of God just
[36:04] taking over in our lives. Help us, Lord.
[36:08] Show us, teach us, Lord. Speak to our
[36:11] hearts,
[36:13] Lord God. And I pray tonight that Lord,
[36:15] those things that you have laid upon our
[36:18] hearts, we just ask that God, you would
[36:20] give us the grace to step aside. Lord,
[36:23] if you would see that there's a channel
[36:24] here tonight or something, Lord, that
[36:27] would need to be mentioned or said,
[36:29] Lord, Father,
[36:32] it's not be on you to go off and to move
[36:36] down, Lord, one avenue, Lord, to
[36:38] minister to one need. I love that about
[36:42] you, Lord. So many things. I love you,
[36:45] Lord, but I'm so thankful that you're
[36:47] mindful of, Lord, every need. And you
[36:51] don't weigh it in a balance to say,
[36:53] "This is a big need. This is a little
[36:55] need." That's not how you work, Lord.
[36:59] You come and will minister to every
[37:02] need. Lord, as we'll just look to you,
[37:06] you'll minister to everyone. No matter
[37:09] no matter the size,
[37:12] you'll minister the same, Lord. For you
[37:15] take every need with the same matter of
[37:18] consideration.
[37:20] And you minister to it, Lord. Oh God,
[37:24] help us tonight, Lord. Give us grace,
[37:26] Lord, as we come in here from jobs and
[37:29] Lord, all the walks of life. Would you
[37:31] give us grace for the next few moments
[37:33] Lord that Father we could be lifted from
[37:35] this physical address Lord and just to
[37:38] enter into heavenly places and to
[37:41] receive the strength Lord and the
[37:43] guidance and the leadership what we have
[37:44] need of Lord
[37:47] Father for this life. We love you and we
[37:51] thank you Father for your mercies Lord.
[37:53] Truly, as the song is sung and has been
[37:56] said, we see your goodness all over our
[38:00] life.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Lord God is a phrase that's common many
[38:04] times among people that could say when
[38:06] they would just try to speak of how that
[38:09] this is something that a certain person
[38:11] has done. They would say it has their
[38:14] fingerprints all over it. Oh Lord God,
[38:18] there's no greater blessing, no greater
[38:21] honor than Lord, our lives might have
[38:22] your fingerprints all over it, Lord.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. I pray, Father, may your
[38:29] mercies, Lord, just move in now, Lord,
[38:32] among us. Just Lord, another wave, Lord,
[38:34] as the waves of your presence is here
[38:36] already.
[38:38] Come, Lord, I pray. Be the speaker,
[38:41] Lord, tonight. Speak through us, hear
[38:43] through us. We need you, Father.
[38:47] We commit this service into your hands
[38:50] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[38:54] Amen. Amen. God bless you musicians.
[38:57] Thank you.
[38:59] Amen. Let's go here in the scriptures if
[39:02] you would tonight in Ephesians chapter
[39:04] 2. We want to invite you there and I say
[39:07] it's so good to be gathered together and
[39:09] &gt;&gt; amen in God's presence and uh Amen. And
[39:12] the Lord has just certainly Amen. just
[39:16] given us grace to be here tonight and
[39:18] and strength and
[39:22] Amen. just want to say we certainly love
[39:23] each one of you and it's just good to be
[39:25] together. Amen. And um just want to
[39:28] remind you tomorrow to have a fire pit
[39:32] fellowship. And I can tell you over here
[39:35] already it when I get over here and I
[39:38] walk out and take take a walk out here
[39:40] sometimes at midday
[39:43] it says 78 degrees some days and I said
[39:45] there ain't no way in the world it's 78
[39:47] degrees. That coolness that comes right
[39:50] around. I'm talking about at noon time.
[39:52] So many times you'll find when I'm out
[39:54] here I'm in a flannel shirt. I'm walking
[39:56] around. and I've got jackets on and
[39:58] everything else and know the air
[40:00] conditioner is not on in here but I just
[40:01] get chilled. It don't take much. Um but
[40:05] um just when we walk around out there
[40:07] and I think it's probably when we look
[40:10] at it and having a fire. I know some of
[40:13] the other ones we had it was pretty hot.
[40:14] It was already a fire without having a
[40:16] fire. Somebody whistling at me or
[40:21] Amen. I'm just teasing you. Amen. But uh
[40:25] we just so we're so so glad to be
[40:27] gathered here in the house of the Lord.
[40:30] Amen. I know. I figured it out.
[40:34] Amen. Well, hey, we're a family. We can,
[40:36] you know, we can.
[40:38] Amen. So, praise the Lord. Well, that
[40:41] don't mean we're going to pick on one
[40:42] another the rest of service, but u
[40:44] Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 14. Let's I
[40:47] will read just a few verses and let you
[40:49] be seated. In verse 14
[40:52] it says, "For he is our peace,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; who hath made both one,
[41:00] and hath broken down the middle wall of
[41:04] partition between us, having abolished
[41:08] in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
[41:12] commandments contained in ordinances.
[41:15] for to make in himself of twain one new
[41:19] man, so making peace, and that he might
[41:24] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[41:28] the cross, having slain the enmity
[41:31] thereby, and came and preached peace to
[41:34] you, which were a far off, and to them
[41:38] that were not.
[41:40] Amen. Let me I think I I missed
[41:42] something here. Yeah, we're there.
[41:45] Amen. May God bless you as you're being
[41:47] seated.
[41:54] I want to just speak here tonight,
[41:56] continue on that thought, pursuing
[42:00] the right thing. And I want to just I
[42:03] want to read here a few more scriptures
[42:04] here in just a moment.
[42:08] But I want you to notice in that in that
[42:10] opening scripture where we read that as
[42:13] it expresses that
[42:15] he is our peace.
[42:18] And to think of how that all of this of
[42:21] where you and I are at tonight or to
[42:23] even have the opportunity
[42:26] to be joined in a real union with God as
[42:31] God so desired. God longed for that
[42:34] fellowship. He longed for that to be
[42:38] restored and he's the only one that
[42:40] could make a way that could really
[42:41] restore that fellowship.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; We know that God would actually so
[42:47] desiring fellowship he would actually
[42:49] give man a substitute that he would be
[42:52] able to come and to fellowship through
[42:56] that uh of the blood of the substitute
[42:58] of an innocent one. Yet it would not be
[43:01] fully what God desired because God's
[43:04] desire was that through the shedding of
[43:07] blood that he might actually come and
[43:10] dwell within man once again. That's the
[43:13] way that God that's God's whole plan of
[43:17] oneness. And to think of how that when
[43:19] you see this here in in the opening
[43:22] scripture that it's God
[43:25] who did it all.
[43:28] There's absolutely not one thing in that
[43:30] portion of scripture we read there that
[43:33] you and I had anything to do with.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, we had to
[43:38] surrender, but I'm asking you, what drew
[43:40] you and I to a place of surrender?"
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Not only did he do the work for you and
[43:46] I, and we were certainly unlovable. We
[43:50] might have had no matter what all the
[43:52] differences was, no matter you know, no
[43:55] matter backgrounds, no matter where
[43:56] where it was we were sitting, we were
[43:59] all when it comes down to it, we were
[44:02] all enmity in our minds in the nature.
[44:05] Our nature was contrary to God. But God
[44:10] made a way so that you and I might be
[44:13] one. And then through that oneness with
[44:15] God, with his spirit dwelling in us,
[44:18] there's another part within that that
[44:20] then through that oneness with God in
[44:23] our life. Then as we're assembled as a
[44:26] body of believers together and God has
[44:29] done every bit of this, but it starts
[44:31] with just that. It starts with that
[44:33] unity where God takes a hold of our
[44:36] lives that the Bible would say it's the
[44:39] goodness of God that leads us to
[44:41] repentance. It's not it wasn't us who
[44:43] was seeking after God. The longing that
[44:45] we had within our lives is because that
[44:48] we were a part of God. There was a
[44:50] desire to know God. But that desire did
[44:53] not come from an earthly origin. That's
[44:56] why there's no earthly origin could
[44:58] satisfy it. It had to come. The only
[45:01] thing that could satisfy that is what
[45:04] would come from above. And you would
[45:06] say, well, what do you mean by earthly
[45:07] and heavenly? Because religion, I want
[45:10] you to understand that man is given to
[45:11] religion. Man is driven to worship.
[45:14] They're going to worship something.
[45:15] They'll worship. They'll worship their
[45:16] family. They'll worship their cars.
[45:18] They'll worship and they're driven to
[45:20] worship. We see that even with Cain.
[45:22] Cain himself, he came to worship. But
[45:25] the difference with Cain's worship and
[45:27] Abel's worship is Cain offered God will
[45:31] worship. It was based on his will of
[45:34] what he could do. But Abel's worship was
[45:36] based on a surrendered will to the will
[45:39] of God. And God accepted that and God
[45:42] that God's acceptance of what what it
[45:44] was what it was that he had revealed to
[45:46] Abel. And Abel came with that that
[45:48] acceptable offering. And to see that it
[45:50] is all it's God that has brought all of
[45:53] this together with in our lives. It's
[45:56] God who has drawn us. It's God who who
[45:58] paid the price for us, who came down.
[46:01] It's God who who sent his spirit to seek
[46:04] you and I out to draw us to a place of
[46:06] repentance. It's God who began to deal
[46:08] with our hearts to cleanse our hearts to
[46:10] even cause us to turn from things. It's
[46:13] God that begin to move in our lives and
[46:15] with a longing that Lord I I I want to
[46:18] be one with you. I I I appreciate all
[46:20] you've done for me, but I really want to
[46:22] be one with you. That that that's the
[46:24] objective. And the whole thing is that
[46:25] it's God that is doing the work the
[46:28] whole time. It's God that is actually
[46:30] drawing on our lives and causing us to
[46:33] ask for what he himself wants to do for
[46:37] us.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; And so to think that even that within
[46:40] this that it's God who who has come down
[46:43] and doing this in in in our lives. Now I
[46:46] want to I want to read a little bit
[46:47] further here in in the book of Ephesians
[46:50] chapter 2 going on down in those
[46:52] scriptures there as it speaks. For
[46:54] through him we both have access by one
[46:58] spirit unto the Father. Now therefore,
[47:02] ye are no more strangers and foreigners,
[47:05] but fellow citizens with the saints, and
[47:07] of the household of God, and are built
[47:10] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[47:13] prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
[47:17] chief cornerstone, in whom all the
[47:20] building fitly framed together, groweth
[47:23] unto a holy temple in the Lord, in whom
[47:26] ye also are builded together for
[47:29] inhabitation.
[47:31] through the spirit. And notice that as
[47:34] it as it would go on as it would speak
[47:36] of this and know that that how that the
[47:39] the spirit of God bringing us together
[47:42] in a oneness and a unity and and then to
[47:45] see how that God through that is it's a
[47:48] body. So remember you as an individual,
[47:52] me as an individual, we are a temple of
[47:55] the Holy Ghost.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; And yet God is also building a body.
[48:00] Remember he said upon this rock, this
[48:02] revelation, I will build my church. So
[48:05] not only does God impart that revelation
[48:09] of himself to every stone that he has
[48:12] predestinated and brings and gathers
[48:16] from all walks of life. But God will
[48:19] bring those stones together by that
[48:21] revelation, not by man's idea, not by
[48:25] man's uh man's doing, but it's by the
[48:28] spirit of God in every age from Ephesus
[48:31] all the way on down. Those stones have
[48:33] been laying there. And remember this
[48:36] age, this age does not stand alone. But
[48:39] this is the age where the spirit of God
[48:42] as it comes down from that of the
[48:44] capstone is that of the brotherly
[48:47] kindness that will actually seal the
[48:50] entire pyramid together in rapturing
[48:54] grace.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; So God has been working little by
[48:58] little. He's been gathering the stones
[49:00] all the way down from Ephesus all all
[49:02] the way and it's all been under under
[49:05] his guidance and leadership and bringing
[49:08] it together. Now, as we were looking at
[49:10] here before, I'm sure that throughout it
[49:13] with the gathering of those stones, it's
[49:15] just like you and I. No matter the
[49:17] church in Ephesus, the prophet tells us
[49:19] there over and over, he said they only
[49:21] had 12 people among them. And brother
[49:24] Brown will pull from that all through
[49:25] the message and tell us of how that
[49:27] crowds itself is no sign of God's
[49:31] vindication. And yet, how we love, I
[49:34] mean, don't we love to get together? We
[49:36] love when more as more of us would get
[49:38] together. Isn't it wonderful to be a
[49:39] part in a meeting and just to get
[49:41] together with other brothers and
[49:43] sisters? Absolutely. But yet God within
[49:46] himself how that each one of those parts
[49:49] even within the e church at Ephesus with
[49:52] among those 12 people they would be ever
[49:55] so different within their own makeups
[49:58] and temperaments and the way that they
[50:00] are. How in the world could you ever put
[50:03] together a group of people and actually
[50:06] get them into a place of harmony? Well,
[50:09] it all starts with one thing, and that's
[50:11] where they begin to get the focus off of
[50:14] themselves. And you see, God God doesn't
[50:17] come around to lecture you and I. And
[50:19] he's not trying to school us into
[50:20] something. He's not trying to educate us
[50:23] into something. But God has one way that
[50:26] he has of getting our mind off of
[50:29] ourself and other things. And that is
[50:32] when he makes himself known in the
[50:35] promise of his word. That's what begins
[50:37] to get the attention of the believer.
[50:40] Because within that, as the spirit of
[50:43] God will move, it begins to draw by that
[50:46] by that revelation and begins to take
[50:48] our attention off of self and put it on
[50:51] him. Because that's what the real
[50:52] revelation is. It's it's of him of his
[50:55] working within the body. And then as we
[50:58] give ourselves to that, the spirit of
[51:01] God be is making known through the
[51:03] indwelling and that revelation of what
[51:05] God's purpose is that he wants to dwell
[51:09] within every single heart. Think about
[51:11] this. On the road to Emmas, what did he
[51:14] do in the fulfillment of the word? He
[51:17] was gathering stones together. And then
[51:19] those stones having such a certainty
[51:22] about them, they went into the upper
[51:25] room and they went there. The Bible says
[51:27] with joy praising God. No wonder the
[51:30] prophet says at the end of the token
[51:32] message in Jeffersonville, he said as
[51:34] you're coming to receive the Holy Ghost,
[51:37] be thankful. Be thankful and thank God
[51:40] because it is a sure promise. And the
[51:44] message of the hour never has placed it
[51:47] to be a maybe or to be a might or to be
[51:49] a happenstance. But all the way down
[51:52] through the ages, God's desire has been
[51:55] that of the Holy Spirit to dwell within
[51:58] man. And we know it's been given in
[52:00] portion down through the ages as God has
[52:03] been building up his body. But they
[52:05] would now come into that place where the
[52:07] Bible says they were all in one accord.
[52:10] That is a mystery in itself of how that
[52:12] they were able to come in one accord
[52:14] before the Holy Ghost ever came. But let
[52:17] me just go ahead and tell you right now,
[52:19] if the Holy Ghost had not come, that one
[52:21] accord would never have had any lasting
[52:24] value to it. It would have only been a
[52:26] matter of time. You'd have seen the same
[52:28] thing that was taking place where when
[52:30] they were walking behind the Lord Jesus
[52:32] and they begin to say, "Well, I'm the
[52:34] greatest and and I'm the greatest." So
[52:36] they went in there with one accord with
[52:39] a harmony where and that whole phrase
[52:41] one accord it means to actually as you
[52:44] have a note I have a note maybe it's a
[52:46] whole note maybe you've got a 16th note
[52:48] maybe it's an eighth note but it don't
[52:50] matter you're not holding your note back
[52:53] but you're willing to give your note as
[52:55] part of the great music sheet and God
[52:58] knows what he's laid in each of our
[53:00] lives and he's not going to take it from
[53:02] us he's not going to demand it from us
[53:04] that's not how God operates But God
[53:06] works to draw out of our lives in
[53:09] surrender what he's placed in each of
[53:11] our lives. And let me just say this to
[53:13] you. Each and every one of you have a
[53:16] vital part in the economy of God. Let me
[53:20] just tell you when the prophet, if
[53:21] you'll just study that economy of God,
[53:24] you'll find the prophet taking us over
[53:26] and over. Perfect faith, you can search
[53:28] it all the way on back and he'll tie in
[53:30] the economy of God. There's pastors,
[53:32] there's prophets, there's teachers, and
[53:34] brother Brandon will bring back over
[53:36] mechanics. There's housewives. All of
[53:38] that is a part of the economy of God
[53:41] because after all real mature sons and
[53:44] daughters of God coming into a place of
[53:46] adoption in the family of God is
[53:49] actually being under the complete
[53:52] tutorship of the Holy Spirit where
[53:54] Christ is working to bring out every
[53:57] single virtue and bring it to that place
[54:00] to where it we come to a place of
[54:02] reflecting him completely to where he
[54:05] can say here you them.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; They're my voice.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to say God is working and
[54:13] he moves within our lives and he's he's
[54:15] building us. He knows what he's doing.
[54:17] Now, you know, when you think of it that
[54:19] God never asked any one of these stones.
[54:21] He never asked you. He never asked me.
[54:23] He never asked me and said, "Hey,
[54:25] Samuel, let me ask you something. What
[54:26] church would you rather pastor?"
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, let me give you let me give
[54:33] you a criteria what I would like. This
[54:35] is what I would like. He didn't ask me
[54:37] that.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; You see, listen. Choice, choosing of a
[54:41] bride. Choice, the prophet says, is a
[54:44] wonderful thing. It's a great thing. But
[54:48] you see in in it sometimes how the enemy
[54:51] wants to come and try to, you know, work
[54:53] on that of choice. You know, you you
[54:54] you've heard of these things of how that
[54:57] he'll even come around. I mean, young
[54:58] people know it. I I've dealt with it
[54:59] with them on FOMO, fear of missing out.
[55:01] It's like, oh, this is the going thing.
[55:03] and it's just it's just moving along
[55:05] with things. But we we want our choices
[55:08] to be under the influence
[55:10] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit. God doesn't want us
[55:12] operating by fear. He wants us under
[55:14] divine love.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; So, you know that and we see that all
[55:18] around and with all of those things of
[55:20] of fear and how the enemy wants to drive
[55:22] things and and no doubt we've all made
[55:24] decisions or choices or things like that
[55:26] out of fear. You know, you get in a car
[55:27] dealership and here you are buying a
[55:29] brand new car and this is the greatest
[55:30] thing. You know, they are telling you,
[55:32] "Man, this is so wonderful. In this
[55:33] nice, in this nice. In this nice. In
[55:35] this nice. In this nice. In this nice.
[55:37] In this nice. In this nice." And then
[55:38] you can sit down at the desk and they'd
[55:40] say, "Uh, would you want an extended
[55:42] warranty on that?"
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Well, this is so nice. Why do you offer
[55:46] me a extended warranty? And by the way,
[55:47] why is it only this many years?
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, and then that'll just be another,
[55:53] you know, whatever it is now, $3,500,
[55:55] $4,000. That'll just be this and that'll
[55:58] just be that. But you see that within it
[56:00] if we're not careful. Oh my goodness,
[56:01] man. Yeah, this got a lot of electric
[56:02] stuff on it. Yeah, this is a push button
[56:04] here. Yeah, this the and you start
[56:06] looking and we can make decisions
[56:08] sometimes out of fear. Now, I'm not
[56:10] saying every decision we make like that.
[56:12] But you understand what I'm talking
[56:13] about that I I believe that within it
[56:16] that we come back and say, God, give me
[56:18] the leadership and the wisdom and
[56:21] direction that I need in my life for the
[56:24] choices that lay before me. So within
[56:26] these stones, you know, the stones
[56:28] didn't get to choose of of actually uh
[56:31] are you are are you going to be a stone
[56:33] that's right next to this stone or that
[56:35] stone? Or are you going to say, "No, I
[56:37] don't want to be next to that stone. I
[56:38] need this. I need a stone that's a
[56:39] little bit taller. I need one I I want a
[56:41] stone that's like this. I want a stone
[56:43] that's like that." Ain't it funny that a
[56:45] lot of the requests that one stone would
[56:46] make of another has nothing to do with
[56:49] spirituality?
[56:51] It would have everything to do with
[56:53] carnality
[56:55] &gt;&gt; of what fits our temperament.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Those that we like. Now, I'm not talking
[57:01] about love. I'm talking about like like
[57:03] to where you know everything. It just
[57:05] seems to mesh and go right along. But
[57:07] see, God God knows what he's doing. And
[57:11] you know, you and I would look at it and
[57:13] think, "Oh my, that that you know there
[57:14] just like in the workplace, you know,
[57:16] there's some people in the workplace.
[57:18] It's like oil and water. You don't want
[57:20] to put them together. You already know.
[57:22] Let me just save time for today. I ain't
[57:24] putting those two together. They're not
[57:26] going out on a job together because I
[57:28] already know I've already got too much
[57:29] to do. And I do not want to have to sit
[57:32] here when I get home and have to deal
[57:35] with differences. Now, we do we can do
[57:37] that as managers and bosses. And I did
[57:40] that with teaching school. I went this
[57:42] one over here, this one here, and this
[57:44] one there. Man, it was strategic. It was
[57:46] not pick out your seats where you want
[57:48] to sit. Not for me. I I I already been
[57:50] through that. I lost enough hair with
[57:52] that. It was trying because we're there
[57:53] for one purpose.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Right. And so it's just trying to avoid
[57:57] certain things. But think about it. God
[58:00] in his infinite mercy, he himself didn't
[58:03] even give us a choice of who we would go
[58:06] to church with.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I know we can make decisions. I
[58:10] understand that, friends. And and God
[58:12] can lead us. I I understand that just as
[58:14] he's led led you here tonight. But to
[58:15] think about how that God would place
[58:17] everything together because you
[58:19] understand what it is. It's not about
[58:21] the stone on either side of you. It's
[58:24] about the glory of God in your heart
[58:27] that's being veiled. And when that glory
[58:30] is there in our heart, then really
[58:32] that's where we really are in position.
[58:34] And it gives us the grace to be able to
[58:37] look over all the differences in one
[58:40] another.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[58:45] Woo. Glory. So notice when you know
[58:48] Solomon when he was building this house
[58:50] and they had stones. I like how brother
[58:52] Bam always go through it. He said these
[58:54] stones would come from all of these
[58:56] places and they were made ready before
[58:58] it was brought thither. So they were
[59:01] already you know shaped and and and and
[59:04] everything was so placed within such a
[59:06] way to where it would come together.
[59:08] Now, brother Brandham, as he will go
[59:10] through this over and over, he will
[59:12] speak of this coming together of these
[59:14] stones as likened that to the rapture.
[59:16] But then he also will tie it together
[59:19] with that of a local body and how that
[59:21] God working even through the bride body
[59:24] that's right now as well as the body
[59:26] that has been built all the way through
[59:28] Ephesus to where that every stone when
[59:31] it came there was not going to be a
[59:33] sound of a hammer or an axe or a tool of
[59:36] iron. Now, it didn't mean that there was
[59:38] maybe a little bit of finishing touches
[59:40] here or there, but they were not going
[59:42] to have to take that stone and
[59:44] completely redesign it. It was made
[59:47] ready for where it was to be placed.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Now, how in the world are we going to
[59:52] know where to place it? Well, first of
[59:54] all, you got to start with the chief
[59:57] cornerstone.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; You do not start with other stones and
[1:00:00] say, "We got to get these stones
[1:00:01] together in harmony." No, that's how man
[1:00:04] would do it. But the chief cornerstone,
[1:00:07] he's the one. When we seek for the chief
[1:00:09] cornerstone, which is Christ, the Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit, the revealed word of God, when
[1:00:15] the chief cornerstone is first place,
[1:00:18] then it will give direction for every
[1:00:21] other cornerstone and every other stone
[1:00:24] cuz you've got a lot of cornerstones in
[1:00:27] your life. Your marriage is a
[1:00:29] cornerstone. Your job cornerstone.
[1:00:32] There's things that get joined together
[1:00:34] and things where you'll be at. But what
[1:00:36] is important is that you know and you
[1:00:39] have that chief cornerstone and you work
[1:00:43] from that pattern
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; So this was made ready before it got
[1:00:50] there. My goodness. Almost sounds like
[1:00:52] some of these houses they ship in
[1:00:54] nowadays, huh?
[1:00:56] I never forget like right down from us
[1:00:57] from these houses they started building.
[1:00:59] I I mean they they threw that they threw
[1:01:01] that part of the development up and in
[1:01:03] and literally I'm not exaggerating. It
[1:01:04] was at least about a year and I watched
[1:01:06] how they were bringing stuff in there. I
[1:01:07] thought Lord have mercy don't let the
[1:01:09] big bad wolf come along there.
[1:01:12] Some of you get that.
[1:01:15] But notice this. Brother Bram says, "I
[1:01:18] uh it's time, I think, in this time that
[1:01:21] we should be assembling
[1:01:23] ourselves together
[1:01:26] and becoming more one, for we are not
[1:01:29] divided." Now, isn't this incredible? We
[1:01:32] should be assembling ourselves together.
[1:01:33] You know, there's things that God will
[1:01:35] do for you, like he'll open the Red Sea.
[1:01:38] Some of you are reading ahead of me.
[1:01:39] Right.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Just
[1:01:44] my fault for putting it up there like
[1:01:45] that. But let me just say it like this.
[1:01:47] You know, there's things that God will
[1:01:48] do for us. And there's things he opens a
[1:01:50] Red Sea cuz we can't do that. He opens a
[1:01:53] Jordan cuz we can't do that. He takes
[1:01:54] down He takes down the walls of Jericho
[1:01:57] cuz we can't do that.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; But there's things that God asked you
[1:02:00] and I to do. And it might seem like an
[1:02:03] easier task for us to open the Red Sea,
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; but the very thing that he asks is
[1:02:10] assemble yourselves together.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; You know when Paul would write that
[1:02:15] forsake not to assemble yourselves
[1:02:18] together.
[1:02:20] Oh my. That means where where where
[1:02:24] stones absolutely have to haul
[1:02:26] themselves
[1:02:28] beyond their differences,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; right? and holding to the purpose at
[1:02:32] hand
[1:02:34] because if differences is is what
[1:02:37] becomes the focus and the stone can
[1:02:40] dwell on that then that it's not going
[1:02:41] to be a real joining and uniting
[1:02:44] together. Let me just say this to you.
[1:02:46] We need the complete unity by the spirit
[1:02:49] of God in each of our lives.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; We want God to move in every service.
[1:02:54] Listen friends, I'm just telling you, I
[1:02:55] don't study any different for Thursday
[1:02:57] night than I do for Sunday. I don't
[1:02:59] study any differently for any other
[1:03:00] service. It doesn't matter what's going
[1:03:02] on. Just my I give myself to God in the
[1:03:05] same way. And that's why I'm saying it.
[1:03:07] We don't have to just wait till Sunday.
[1:03:09] We don't have to wait till another time.
[1:03:11] God is God. He's just as much God
[1:03:14] tonight as he will be on Sunday. And how
[1:03:17] do you know that what God wants to do
[1:03:19] and will do in your life today will
[1:03:21] prepare you for what he will do not only
[1:03:24] on Sunday but now coming through the
[1:03:27] oncoming days that are ahead. God is at
[1:03:30] work within our lives.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And this this unity that God would bring
[1:03:35] us to. We have different ideas
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; just like our thumbrints are not alike.
[1:03:41] It's just like we can have all kinds of
[1:03:43] different ideas. I think it's too cold.
[1:03:45] I think it's too hot. I think it's too
[1:03:47] middle. I think it's too this. I think
[1:03:48] it's too this. I think it's too that. I
[1:03:50] think the music this. I think this. I
[1:03:52] think that. I think I think. And if
[1:03:54] we're not careful, the whole focus
[1:03:57] becomes differences.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, why don't we just
[1:04:02] iron all them out? So, who do we use as
[1:04:05] the absolute?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Your ideas? Your ideas? Because if we do
[1:04:10] it by your ideas, then somebody else's
[1:04:12] ideas.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Then somebody else's ideas. than
[1:04:14] somebody else's is right. So when we
[1:04:18] have to come to a place that no
[1:04:20] understand that we're not going to ever
[1:04:21] have all of our ideas if we think for a
[1:04:24] moment that everybody itself oh my this
[1:04:27] is some great utopia I know you know
[1:04:29] sometimes you know it's just like you
[1:04:30] know it can have where people oh my just
[1:04:33] a wonderful beautiful utopia stick
[1:04:34] around a little while you'll see the
[1:04:36] differences but our differences are not
[1:04:39] what we're focusing on
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; are you hearing me it doesn't matter
[1:04:43] where you go matter what assembly you go
[1:04:45] to there are differences even in that
[1:04:49] assembly. And this is where it takes the
[1:04:51] spirit of God to where that those
[1:04:53] differences don't become clicks, clans,
[1:04:57] and small little fellowship groups.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; You see, God purposely sets it in that
[1:05:09] way. If he wanted us to be in a church
[1:05:12] that was exactly it, fit our ideas. I
[1:05:16] mean it was exactly right on that would
[1:05:18] be about me, you usually
[1:05:25] have to. You know, brother Ram tells us
[1:05:26] we make a choice within within our
[1:05:29] church. But to understand with different
[1:05:31] ideas that we have, you know, it's just
[1:05:34] like as we move through this, brother
[1:05:36] Bram says we have different thumbrints.
[1:05:39] Our appetites perhaps would not be the
[1:05:42] same. And the church said
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; that's true in principle. We are human
[1:05:48] beings and that's what it is in
[1:05:50] Christianity. Our differences of
[1:05:52] organizations yet one. We are one
[1:05:56] because we're children of God born of
[1:06:00] his spirit washed in his blood.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; So we're not one because we all see
[1:06:07] everything eye to eye.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; That's not why we're one. Brother
[1:06:11] Samuel, when that's going to be when we
[1:06:13] are changed.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; When we are changed. There are
[1:06:19] principles that we do not compromise on.
[1:06:22] Baptism, the spirit of God, the unity
[1:06:25] thereof, the faith with those are those
[1:06:27] are uncompromising principles. But
[1:06:30] within all of that, there's at times
[1:06:32] where there can be different ideas or a
[1:06:34] different perspective. And you know
[1:06:36] what? God allows that. He permits that.
[1:06:39] And you know what? God will allow it to
[1:06:41] see what kind of an attitude that you
[1:06:43] and I are going to take.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, it's very easy
[1:06:48] for this flesh to get to looking at
[1:06:51] something and say, "Well, my goodness,
[1:06:53] how come that person can't see it like
[1:06:55] that?" Do you understand what that is?
[1:06:57] That's called an elevated position.
[1:07:00] Looking down on somebody else instead of
[1:07:03] maybe they haven't seen or heard or read
[1:07:06] all of the quotes or heard certain
[1:07:08] things or been taught certain things.
[1:07:09] Maybe they haven't. And then again,
[1:07:11] maybe if they have, just like in time
[1:07:13] sitting down with brethren and it comes
[1:07:15] together that you know what, they're not
[1:07:17] going to relinguish on a certain thing.
[1:07:18] This is where they stand and so forth
[1:07:20] and so on. They believe this and believe
[1:07:22] that. Fine. You know what? You have a
[1:07:24] choice whether or not you allow your
[1:07:27] differences to separate you or not.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Differences. We're always going to have
[1:07:33] them. Clear to the change of the body.
[1:07:36] In your own home, you've got
[1:07:38] differences.
[1:07:39] You've got preferences. Is that right?
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You didn't get married and interview
[1:07:44] somebody and say, "Do you like butter on
[1:07:46] your toast? And how do you like your
[1:07:48] toast? Do you like it light? Do you like
[1:07:49] it burnt? Do you like it?" You didn't
[1:07:51] interview them. When you first got
[1:07:54] married, you had to realize just keep
[1:07:56] your opinions to yourself because you
[1:07:58] burnt. Who likes burnt? Who likes steak?
[1:08:00] Well done. Oh, well done. O, that's like
[1:08:03] that's like charcoal. You finally
[1:08:05] realize, keep your opinions to yourself.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; That's how you feel. Nobody's taking my
[1:08:13] medium rare away from me. But if I'd
[1:08:16] say, "Well done, hockey puck city.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; No way. Charcoal biscuit." What happens?
[1:08:24] What now? What happens by making that uh
[1:08:27] h announcement? It it just it ruins
[1:08:29] dinner.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; It already becomes a stumbling block.
[1:08:32] instead of you like yours medium rare,
[1:08:35] have a good old time with medium rare.
[1:08:37] If you like yours well done, have a good
[1:08:39] old time with that chainsaw, cutting it
[1:08:41] up and everything else. And we'll see
[1:08:43] you next year as you're chewing the
[1:08:44] first piece.
[1:08:46] I just gave my opinion, didn't I?
[1:08:50] That's okay. I'm picking on my wife.
[1:08:51] She's the She's the one. Well done. You
[1:08:53] know, but notice we are one. Why?
[1:08:56] Because we're children of God, born of
[1:08:59] his spirit, washed in his blood. Now
[1:09:02] watch this. With true unity, let me just
[1:09:04] let me give just a few examples here. In
[1:09:06] this Jesus said, neither pray I for
[1:09:08] these alone, but for them also which
[1:09:11] shall believe on me through their word,
[1:09:13] that they all may be one, as thou,
[1:09:16] Father, art in me, and I in thee, that
[1:09:19] they also may be one in us, that the
[1:09:23] world may believe that thou hast sent
[1:09:25] me. And the glory which thou gavest me,
[1:09:29] I have given them, that they may be one,
[1:09:33] even as we are one. I in them, thou in
[1:09:38] me, that they may be made perfect or
[1:09:41] complete in one, and that the world may
[1:09:44] know that thou hast sent me and hast
[1:09:47] loved them as thou has loved me." Now,
[1:09:50] brother Brad picks us up and he he
[1:09:52] quotes that scripture and he says,
[1:09:53] "Jesus prayed that the church and he
[1:09:56] would be one like he and the father were
[1:09:58] one." That the church, we as members of
[1:10:00] the body of Christ would be one together
[1:10:03] just like he and the father are one. At
[1:10:06] that day, he would know that he was in
[1:10:08] the father, the father in him, he in us,
[1:10:10] and together we were one. What a union,
[1:10:13] a oneness that would be to see God in
[1:10:19] his church. Now notice to see God in his
[1:10:24] church till every member is just
[1:10:27] perfectly in harmony with each other and
[1:10:31] God. Harmony
[1:10:34] does not require that we all see
[1:10:37] everything the same way. Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Harmony is a choice that is made by
[1:10:44] surrendering to the harmony of the Holy
[1:10:47] Spirit on the inside that has brought us
[1:10:50] back into harmony with God.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. See this is why the chief
[1:10:55] cornerstone is absolutely important and
[1:10:59] to be the absolute of our life because
[1:11:01] through that it's where we have the
[1:11:03] strength
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; to yield and work in harmony
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; when they sing sometimes different ones
[1:11:14] they sing up here three-part harmony
[1:11:17] four-part harmony on and on everybody
[1:11:19] has a part
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; if over here when the piano players are
[1:11:24] playing if they played all bass
[1:11:28] on the keys.
[1:11:31] As a matter of fact, a lot of it when it
[1:11:33] gets arranged within a certain way, you
[1:11:35] don't even have this instrument pay
[1:11:37] playing all bass. You you find where you
[1:11:39] can pull the different tenor and bass
[1:11:42] from different instruments and let it
[1:11:43] all blend together.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; And see, God has it in that way. Does
[1:11:48] this have bass? It does have bass. Does
[1:11:50] that have bass? It does. But when it
[1:11:52] begins to blend together, it's not
[1:11:53] necessarily the bass and the bass and
[1:11:55] this that's needed, but they'll use the
[1:11:56] bass guitar. They'll use the bass drum.
[1:11:58] They'll use that as the bass pulling
[1:12:00] from different instruments to actually
[1:12:03] fill all those different parts within
[1:12:06] it. Now, I want you to think of this
[1:12:08] here, how God will bring this together
[1:12:10] perfectly in harmony with each other and
[1:12:13] with God. That's the church that Jesus
[1:12:16] is coming for. That's when his prayer
[1:12:19] will be answered that we will be one.
[1:12:21] And it is the only grounds of fellowship
[1:12:24] that God has ever laid down for himself
[1:12:26] and his church is the oneness of himself
[1:12:29] in the people. That's the only grounds
[1:12:33] of fellowship. He goes on. He says,
[1:12:35] "God's only plan is to bring believers
[1:12:38] to himself in a true oneness is
[1:12:41] receiving the Holy Spirit." Let me just
[1:12:43] say this to you. Without the Holy Spirit
[1:12:47] coming into our lives, we don't have a
[1:12:49] fighting chance.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Not only do we miss the rapture,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; but there we we we do not have even the
[1:12:57] strength
[1:12:59] within our lives that is needed because
[1:13:03] we we're not listen to me. We might be
[1:13:05] part of a local body, but remember,
[1:13:07] you're not saved by being a part of a
[1:13:10] local body. You're kept in fellowship by
[1:13:13] coming to church, right? As God speaks
[1:13:16] to your life. But there's only one body
[1:13:18] and that's the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; It has many members. So there's only one
[1:13:24] place of safety and that's to be under
[1:13:26] the blood. It's to be in Jesus Christ by
[1:13:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And when
[1:13:31] that is come into our life then in then
[1:13:35] from that in our life we have the
[1:13:38] strength not only to uh subdue our own
[1:13:42] lives our own will but it gives us and
[1:13:45] working in our life the same grace
[1:13:48] that's needed to be expressed
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; to one another.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Why didn't God just save us and say you
[1:13:56] know what I'm going to put you on an
[1:13:57] island over here. Put you on an island.
[1:13:59] Put you on an island. Remember, brother
[1:14:00] Ram tells us
[1:14:02] taking sides with Jesus.
[1:14:05] He tell says it a couple times in that
[1:14:07] message. He said, you know,
[1:14:09] faith is accompanied by a law.
[1:14:12] It's got a season of time. He said,
[1:14:14] because if it wasn't, every one of you
[1:14:16] could speak your own world and go live
[1:14:19] in it.
[1:14:21] You see, Jesus, he couldn't, the prophet
[1:14:24] goes on to explain it. He said Jesus
[1:14:26] could not raise until that third day. He
[1:14:29] was held behind a barricade of
[1:14:32] scriptures.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; But when those scriptures were
[1:14:35] fulfilled, then he could raise. And
[1:14:37] that's why the prophet said the same
[1:14:39] Holy Ghost that you have in your life,
[1:14:42] when that is removed at that junction of
[1:14:44] time, there will come a rapture in your
[1:14:47] body from the inside out.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything is held in its
[1:14:54] position for this time until that word
[1:14:58] is fulfilled in our lives.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; So remember it's that's why the prophet
[1:15:02] said you're going to find out one of
[1:15:04] these days heaven isn't some far off
[1:15:07] place out there
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; right would say it over and over. He
[1:15:11] says it's right here moving in a faster
[1:15:14] dimension. In another place he would say
[1:15:16] God let let it be that their glorified
[1:15:19] bodies talking about the theophony. Let
[1:15:21] it come near them and give them a charge
[1:15:24] right here this morning. Because
[1:15:26] remember, when this message has become
[1:15:29] evil food to you and you left everything
[1:15:32] else, you let go of everything else. You
[1:15:35] have heard from your theophony.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; There is nobody here, nobody that has
[1:15:42] heard from our local representative. I
[1:15:44] don't even know who it is.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; I don't even know who it is. Be honest.
[1:15:48] I don't know who it is. There ain't
[1:15:49] nobody heard from them. Oh, you might
[1:15:50] have got flyers in the mail.
[1:15:53] Let me just tell you something. Your
[1:15:55] representation in the heavenlies has
[1:15:58] always been there.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your inheritance.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; And Jesus came in order to bring you
[1:16:09] back to that inheritance. And when you
[1:16:11] by God's grace are lifted up, are lifted
[1:16:14] up to be able to see I come from God.
[1:16:17] I'm going back to God. It stabilizes you
[1:16:21] right here in this earthly realm. Let
[1:16:24] thy will be done in heaven, in earth,
[1:16:27] even as it is in heaven.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; You become a reflection on earth
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; of that heavenly city
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; that you've been born into.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; You're a delicate, as the prophet calls
[1:16:40] it.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; How did we get there?
[1:16:46] So receiving the spirit of God. Now
[1:16:48] watch how the prophet is is talking
[1:16:49] about this oneness here. Let's just
[1:16:52] let's just say it. He asked the people
[1:16:53] to say it after him. So let's just say
[1:16:56] it together. Oneness
[1:16:58] with God is to have God's spirit in you
[1:17:05] agreeing with the word, all the word,
[1:17:10] the whole word, and to make it
[1:17:13] manifested in power.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Brother slowed that down and had the
[1:17:19] congregation repeat that after him
[1:17:21] because that was true oneness.
[1:17:24] Now you listen to the message where you
[1:17:27] can see where Satan gets his idea in on
[1:17:31] John 17. Oh, we all got to be one. And
[1:17:34] it comes under the thought of man. And
[1:17:37] let me just tell you that thought was
[1:17:39] not inspired by man. You say they got
[1:17:41] that from a seminary. I'm going to ask
[1:17:42] you, what's the source of inspiration
[1:17:45] that gave it to the seminary?
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; What's the inspiration that would cause
[1:17:49] all of these places to unite together?
[1:17:53] What is it that would bring about the
[1:17:54] World Council of Churches? I tell you
[1:17:56] what would bring that about. The devil.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what would bring that
[1:18:02] about in a false unity. It's already
[1:18:05] been shown all the way down in the book
[1:18:07] of Genesis. It was a false unity. And it
[1:18:10] was actually providing or purporting to
[1:18:13] provide another way for the people to be
[1:18:17] spared from judgment and get to heaven.
[1:18:19] But there is no other grounds of safety
[1:18:23] outside of Christ in you, the hope of
[1:18:26] glory. There's no other oneness and
[1:18:29] harmony and strength outside of the Holy
[1:18:32] Spirit in your life.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Stones, yes, stones, but stones that are
[1:18:42] field stones, stones that are
[1:18:44] tabernacling, deity, the presence of
[1:18:47] almighty God. And the prophet says,
[1:18:49] "There you are." That's oneness with
[1:18:52] God. When that power works in me, works
[1:18:55] in you, we are one. So how are we one
[1:18:58] when that power works in you, works in
[1:19:01] me?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Not about the same ideas.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Not enough we all feel the same way
[1:19:09] about a certain thing. You know, God
[1:19:11] allows that and he'll allow that all the
[1:19:12] way to the rapture. And the prophet
[1:19:14] says, "And God hiding himself and
[1:19:16] revealing in simplicity," he said, "When
[1:19:18] we get there to the other side, as we
[1:19:20] stand there at the rapture, all of our
[1:19:24] differences will fade away."
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Well, God, why don't you just take them
[1:19:30] away right now? But what God wants to do
[1:19:32] is allow his love in our life to prove
[1:19:36] that it's greater than any difference.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know why? It already did in your
[1:19:41] life. You and I were enemies to God.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; We were as different as different could
[1:19:47] be. But what did the love of God do? It
[1:19:50] looked beyond my fault and saw my need.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; He looked beyond the differences. He
[1:19:57] looked beyond where everything I was at,
[1:19:59] the sin, the condition. He did not
[1:20:01] condone it. He did not love my sin. He
[1:20:04] did not love my habits. He did not love
[1:20:06] that expression of darkness. But he
[1:20:09] loved that seed on the inside and he
[1:20:12] made a way that that seed could come in
[1:20:15] liberty.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; God said, "That's my stone. Release it."
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; That's my stone. Release it.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's my stone. Release it.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Because he's got a purpose.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; And when he speaks, when the king
[1:20:35] speaks,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; it has to listen. Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you something. We
[1:20:42] didn't just become his subjects. We were
[1:20:44] always his.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; My sheep know my voice. My stones know
[1:20:49] my voice.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; That portion of revelation that when
[1:20:54] coming together makes the full revealing
[1:20:57] of Jesus Christ in a bright body. Once
[1:21:00] again, what is it? It's God putting
[1:21:02] himself together in a many membered
[1:21:05] body.
[1:21:07] G
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; glory be to God.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So why were they one?
[1:21:14] Because in the beginning, even in that
[1:21:17] little family in the garden, they were
[1:21:19] one. Because they had God's life in
[1:21:24] them, in each of them. They were one
[1:21:27] with God. And that's what would make
[1:21:29] them one with one another. Remember the
[1:21:34] prophet would tell us it's the lack of
[1:21:36] this revelation, the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:39] Christ, the new birth. That's the reason
[1:21:42] there's so many divisions. Can't you see
[1:21:44] why the enemy
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; the enemy is all about division?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; He's all about trying to stir up stink.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; He's all about trying to plant in our
[1:21:52] minds something. Well, this one don't
[1:21:54] like you or this or that or this. That
[1:21:56] that's that's the Satan. You know why?
[1:21:57] You know why the devil wants to do that?
[1:21:59] Cuz he knows he can't stop this word.
[1:22:02] He cannot keep it from coming to pass.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And you know what he wants to do? He
[1:22:08] wants to try to put different things
[1:22:10] upon you. He wants to try to put his
[1:22:13] nervousness upon you. He wants to try to
[1:22:15] put his anxiety upon you. He wants to
[1:22:18] try to put thoughts in your mind and put
[1:22:20] all of these things. You know what he's
[1:22:21] trying to do? He's trying to disturb the
[1:22:24] economy of God. But listen now. The
[1:22:26] prophet said, "When the true church
[1:22:29] discerns that wrong spirit,"
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Even when it wants to come in our mind
[1:22:35] and withstands it,
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; you are not. I refuse to entertain that.
[1:22:41] That's my brother.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; He might have the goods, but that's my
[1:22:45] brother. You say, "Brother Samuel, what
[1:22:48] kind of strength would that come from?"
[1:22:50] It'll come from the same strength that
[1:22:52] changed your show. It changed your life.
[1:22:56] That token, that life took care of the
[1:22:59] nature in your life.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of strength I'm talking
[1:23:03] about in our life. It's not by power,
[1:23:05] not by might, but by my spirit,
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; saith the Lord, this mountain shall be
[1:23:11] moved.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; False unity.
[1:23:21] this here in Genesis 11. Oh, they all
[1:23:24] got together. Let us make Let us make
[1:23:27] brick. They man they went they did some
[1:23:28] work. They made brick. They they burn it
[1:23:32] thoroughly. Y'all been probably most of
[1:23:34] you seen that down in what? New
[1:23:35] Philadelphia. They got them big. They
[1:23:37] make them bricks down there in New
[1:23:38] Philadelphia. Drive through there
[1:23:39] outside of Sugar Creek. You know, you
[1:23:41] don't go there for bricks. You go there
[1:23:42] for pies and cinnamon rolls.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; But but you drive past those those brick
[1:23:46] kils,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; right? So they had to heat them,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:50] And they also had some slime that they
[1:23:52] were using for mortal mortar. See, they
[1:23:55] knew you had to stick things together.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; But you see, when man tries to take
[1:24:02] God's word and tamper with it,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; and man tries to make it stick together,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; it'll come out in confusion.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; It'll come out leaving people wondering.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; It'll come out where people are no
[1:24:16] longer saying the same thing.
[1:24:19] You know why? Cuz they're using a
[1:24:21] different mortar.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Now that same word mortar means pitch,
[1:24:25] means slime. But Noah had a revelation
[1:24:28] of how to use pitch.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; You see, just listen to me now. Christ
[1:24:34] the mystery. The prophet said, "Janis
[1:24:36] and Jambre, they have the ability." He
[1:24:39] said, "Within them to make and build
[1:24:41] great churches." He said, "But that's
[1:24:44] not what it's about. It's about the
[1:24:47] revelation.
[1:24:49] Because why? It's that revelation that
[1:24:52] would work and operate within the heart
[1:24:55] of the individual. As once again, that's
[1:24:57] why the prophet would stress it's not a
[1:25:00] group collective revelation. It's an
[1:25:03] individual revelation.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; It's an individual work in every stone's
[1:25:11] life.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And you know what? God
[1:25:15] just has a way of just so positionally
[1:25:17] placed that when God came down, he
[1:25:19] looked at it and he said, "Man, the
[1:25:20] people is one." Think about this. I want
[1:25:22] you to think about this. They were one.
[1:25:26] They had one purpose and one heart,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; These were people who were not
[1:25:34] believers.
[1:25:36] These were under direction of Nimrod.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; But yet, think of this. You say, "How in
[1:25:43] the world could a people be brought into
[1:25:46] such a place to where God would say,
[1:25:49] "Behold, they're one." He wasn't saying
[1:25:52] they're in one place. He said they're
[1:25:54] one. It was more. They weren't just in
[1:25:57] one locality. They were one. He could
[1:26:00] see them that their heart purpose. How
[1:26:03] did that happen? It happened by a
[1:26:05] supernatural element.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Stay with me just a few more minutes. It
[1:26:11] happened by a supernatural element. What
[1:26:13] was that supernatural element? Well, if
[1:26:15] the Holy Spirit will unite a people
[1:26:18] together in the true oneness and purpose
[1:26:22] and plan of almighty God, but as they
[1:26:25] come individually into Christ dwelling
[1:26:28] within every heart, then Satan, he will
[1:26:31] come with his anointing. That's
[1:26:33] religious. He'll come with his anointing
[1:26:35] and work to bring everybody together
[1:26:39] under a false unity.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; And notice how the enemy teaches it.
[1:26:46] Tolerance.
[1:26:48] You got to tolerate.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; You know that word tolerance?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you that word tolerance.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the kingdoms that used
[1:26:57] that word tolerance was Rome. right?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Every every nation or kingdom, they
[1:27:04] would take over. They would go in there
[1:27:07] and they did not disband their gods, but
[1:27:10] they begin to teach tolerate
[1:27:13] one another's gods.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Tolerance.
[1:27:17] Don't tell me we've got that right here.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Tolerance. Tolerate this lifestyle.
[1:27:23] Tolerate that. Well, God loves
[1:27:25] everybody. God loves this. God loves
[1:27:27] that. God loves his word. God loves his
[1:27:30] children. He's watched over his word
[1:27:33] down through time. Let me just tell you,
[1:27:35] God is not intimidated by the conditions
[1:27:38] of somebody's life. He knows if there is
[1:27:41] a seed beneath that darkness, all you've
[1:27:43] got to do is get that seed in the
[1:27:45] presence of God. And God can change that
[1:27:48] situation and drive back the darkness
[1:27:50] from their life. Because that spirit,
[1:27:53] that condition is not who they are. They
[1:27:56] are a son and daughter of God.
[1:27:59] [Applause]
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And if Satan can
[1:28:07] supernaturally move a people together in
[1:28:10] unity of purpose under a false system,
[1:28:13] how much more
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; can the Holy Ghost get a hold of a
[1:28:16] people,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; bride elect, and move his purpose and
[1:28:19] objective through her life?
[1:28:23] This is why the real church of the
[1:28:24] living God is built on the revelation of
[1:28:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; This is let me just let me just try to
[1:28:33] bring this down here.
[1:28:36] For our comely parts, Paul dealing with
[1:28:39] the body
[1:28:41] have no need. But God hath tempered
[1:28:46] the body together,
[1:28:48] having given more abundant honor to that
[1:28:51] part which lacked.
[1:28:53] Now, I'm just going to tell you,
[1:28:55] if you're wearing your shoes on your
[1:28:57] head, you got problems.
[1:29:00] You wear shoes on your feet. Well, you
[1:29:02] say, "I need them." But God gives them
[1:29:04] more honor to the uncumbly parts.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's what what Paul is bringing out.
[1:29:13] sometimes the of of wear upon the parts
[1:29:16] that are so uncomly but yet how that
[1:29:19] part would be you know dressed up or but
[1:29:24] notice God tempers it together.
[1:29:27] God does that. Not man. Not man saying,
[1:29:30] "Let me just say this to you. We're
[1:29:32] gonna hammer. We're going to hammer this
[1:29:34] out.
[1:29:37] Ain't going to work."
[1:29:40] Wastes a whole lot of energy.
[1:29:42] I agree. We can talk. We We talk things.
[1:29:44] Let's just Let's try. But you know what?
[1:29:46] Within it all, after talking, it should
[1:29:49] be able to say, "You know what?
[1:29:51] Disagree." But you know what? We're
[1:29:52] still brothers,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; still sisters.
[1:29:55] Right now, if you're not careful, this
[1:29:58] is why it's got to be the love of God so
[1:30:00] thick in our life. Because it's not
[1:30:02] careful, little thing can start to move
[1:30:04] right in there.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And on that difference, oo, it'll start
[1:30:07] growing, growing, growing.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It may not grow as fast as Jack's
[1:30:12] beantoalk, but it'll grow.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; It'll grow. And if you're not careful,
[1:30:17] it'll keep growing. And you'll be taking
[1:30:19] that as a way of an escape, as an
[1:30:21] excuse.
[1:30:24] Let me tell you, if it's not anything
[1:30:26] that God has planted, and listen, we all
[1:30:29] are able, don't matter where you're at,
[1:30:30] you're able, should be able to discern
[1:30:32] that. You can look at things that come
[1:30:34] in your life. If it's something, listen
[1:30:36] to me. If the prophet says, if Satan, I
[1:30:38] want you to watch how he says this. If
[1:30:40] Satan presents anything in your mind
[1:30:45] against one of the others in the
[1:30:47] assembly, turn it down. Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; For he says, "As soon as you entertain
[1:30:52] it,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; you mar your experience."
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; What a responsibility. And listen
[1:31:01] friends, you think Satan ain't firing
[1:31:03] off to try to get thoughts and things in
[1:31:04] our mind? Cuz let me just tell you, the
[1:31:06] way things work in our life, it has to
[1:31:09] come in by way of thought
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; and how the enemy would would want to so
[1:31:14] do that. So there's going to be
[1:31:16] differences, but God, it's not man. It's
[1:31:19] God that has tempered us together.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; It's God who tempers us together.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; You know what tempering does? You worked
[1:31:29] in the steel mill. The others worked in
[1:31:30] the steel m worked in. You know what
[1:31:32] tempering does? It don't make things
[1:31:34] softer. It makes it harder. Now
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; isn't it incredible? Paul would tell
[1:31:39] Timothy, "Endure hardness as a good
[1:31:42] soldier, not become hard."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; That's the battle within our lives.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; It's not to become hardened
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; with the passage of time,
[1:31:53] disappointments
[1:31:54] over and over and over and over. But let
[1:31:57] me just say this to you. You know what?
[1:31:58] It takes work. It takes labor. It takes
[1:32:02] something from us to be willing to work
[1:32:06] through differences.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; You can run from differences all your
[1:32:12] life. Eventually, you're a child of God.
[1:32:14] You're going to have to grow in that
[1:32:16] area of your life.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Now, maybe it can be something that
[1:32:19] maybe wasn't taught when we were coming
[1:32:21] up and and we were kind of pampered a
[1:32:23] certain way and every time the teacher
[1:32:24] said this, the teacher was absolutely a
[1:32:26] devil and our child was the angel and
[1:32:28] this or that. See what happens is it
[1:32:30] actually is a setback till now there's
[1:32:32] things that now has set into their life
[1:32:34] even after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:32:36] that's got to be worked through in their
[1:32:37] life so that they are not subservient to
[1:32:40] a complex from way back in childhood
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; that everybody's against me. You say,
[1:32:46] "Brother Samuel, can those things
[1:32:47] exist?" Sure they can. Sure they can.
[1:32:50] But you know what? Let me just tell you
[1:32:51] something. Greater is he that's in you
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. And you
[1:32:55] know what? God God was not ashamed. God
[1:32:58] didn't say, "Oh Lord, how did I get into
[1:33:00] this, my man? I should have called a
[1:33:01] plumber. I should have called a savior.
[1:33:03] I should have called a redeemer. I
[1:33:04] should have called a deliverer. I should
[1:33:06] He is that.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, your situation in
[1:33:10] his life, he's not ashamed of you. He's
[1:33:13] not ashamed of the situations, but he
[1:33:16] takes those situations as opportunities
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; to prove the greatness of his grace
[1:33:23] through your life." Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say glory be to God.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God be for us, who can be
[1:33:33] against us?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; So God tempers us together,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; not hardening us against one another.
[1:33:40] And that's not the tempering but through
[1:33:43] the test and trials
[1:33:46] even as an assembly that we go through
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; individually and then even as an
[1:33:52] assembly because churches go through
[1:33:55] seasons.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be nice if every season here
[1:34:00] was spring? Well, brother Samuel, spring
[1:34:02] is resurrection. I know. I get that.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; I get that. It is the rising of the sun.
[1:34:07] I get that.
[1:34:10] But God likes to allow, as the prophet
[1:34:12] said, an eagle stir at this nest, dry
[1:34:14] seasons
[1:34:16] to see what you'll do.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; To see what will transpire in our life.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; See, this is where this is where it
[1:34:25] comes down to where you as a as a fellow
[1:34:28] stone realize, wait a minute here. I see
[1:34:30] a need, Lord. We need more of you. We
[1:34:34] need more of you. So you know what
[1:34:35] happens is you take it upon your heart
[1:34:38] praying for the services, praying for
[1:34:40] one another, praying you know what God
[1:34:43] God allows that to do what? Draw us
[1:34:45] beyond ourselves.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; He's not showing you something. When God
[1:34:51] shows you something, God's not showing
[1:34:53] you something to put down what his blood
[1:34:56] has been shed for.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; He shows it to you that you might go
[1:35:01] into prayer because why? He made you
[1:35:04] partners with him in redemption. And
[1:35:07] it's redeemer anointing that works in
[1:35:10] your life.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; He's tempering tempering the church
[1:35:16] together. Hallelujah.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Notice Paul
[1:35:24] would write this here
[1:35:26] in Colossians 2.
[1:35:29] That their hearts might be comforted
[1:35:32] being knit
[1:35:34] together in love.
[1:35:36] Knit together. That's where that's where
[1:35:39] things get sewed together.
[1:35:44] My mother-in-law does tremendous what a
[1:35:47] gift with the making all sorts of
[1:35:50] things. I don't even want to try to list
[1:35:51] everything she's done. She's made a
[1:35:52] purse and everything else.
[1:35:55] She even makes my father-in-law some
[1:35:56] socks.
[1:35:59] Have to ask him about them sometime.
[1:36:01] We We'll leave that alone.
[1:36:04] But she just working with her hands. You
[1:36:05] know what? She takes all these different
[1:36:07] colors and I don't know how in the world
[1:36:09] she does it. She just sits there. Now,
[1:36:11] most of the time for her, what she's
[1:36:12] doing is she's listening to a message in
[1:36:14] a room and she's doing it and weaving
[1:36:15] and doing it and doing and doing and she
[1:36:17] makes these things wonderful. But you
[1:36:19] know what? Knitting things together is
[1:36:21] where you take two separate things and
[1:36:25] you're joining them together.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Let me just stop here tonight with this.
[1:36:33] You know what it is that joins you and I
[1:36:35] together?
[1:36:37] It's the love of God. Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; That that's what it is, friends. And you
[1:36:43] know where it's at? When brother Brown
[1:36:44] will make a statement, he'll talk about
[1:36:46] the mortar. The love of God is the
[1:36:48] mortar. It's the cement in the church.
[1:36:50] He'll use that as types. But then he'll
[1:36:52] say in another place, he said, "Notice
[1:36:54] how that capstone and all those things
[1:36:55] come down. There's no mortar, no no
[1:36:57] cement between it." You know why? He
[1:36:59] uses mortar and cement to type that of
[1:37:01] the spirit of God that would so unite
[1:37:03] things together. Like when think about
[1:37:05] this building, wind storms that come
[1:37:07] through here.
[1:37:10] Storms that come through. We had that
[1:37:11] big storm. What was that? What was that
[1:37:12] last fall? I don't know. Whenever that
[1:37:13] tree fell, I was over there back there
[1:37:14] in the office and my wife's saying, "Run
[1:37:16] to another part of the church." Why?
[1:37:20] Why? I'm like having to come too. Why?
[1:37:22] What? What? What do you mean? I mean,
[1:37:23] I'm, you know, me and my windows right
[1:37:25] in front of me, but she's like, "Hey,
[1:37:26] hey, there there tornadoes and
[1:37:28] everything else over there." Well,
[1:37:28] there's a tree that fell down. Thank God
[1:37:30] it missed the the everything, you know.
[1:37:32] But my point is is that this building,
[1:37:35] you know, we don't sit here and worry
[1:37:36] about it. I'm sorry. I don't mean to
[1:37:38] bring up the three little pigs, but it
[1:37:39] gets the point across. It's not made out
[1:37:41] of straw. Remember, they couldn't blow
[1:37:43] the house made out of brick,
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; But I'm just going to tell you
[1:37:46] something.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; You're you're a stone, but you know, in
[1:37:49] you as a stone, you got feelings.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; You got needs.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; And there's differences all through the
[1:37:57] different complexities of life that we
[1:37:58] come from.
[1:38:00] And God by his spirit would do such a
[1:38:05] work in your life, in your life, in your
[1:38:08] life. And it's him in us that joins us
[1:38:14] together.
[1:38:16] That's why our unity, it's not about let
[1:38:18] me try to get everybody on the right
[1:38:19] page. Let me try to get this. You know,
[1:38:21] it's like when you're trying to coach a
[1:38:22] team, getting everybody on the right
[1:38:23] page, trying to get everybody on the
[1:38:24] right, trying to get all this, doing all
[1:38:25] this, or you're at the job, you got to
[1:38:27] set the direction, set the vision,
[1:38:28] what's the mission statement? and they
[1:38:30] just repeat it like robots and don't
[1:38:32] believe it. Right? It's like
[1:38:37] it's just going on and on. But it's
[1:38:38] that's all it is, just words. But that's
[1:38:40] what's different with the body of
[1:38:41] Christ.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of God, that divine love
[1:38:44] is on the inside, that's what knits us
[1:38:47] together.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:49] You mean to take all these different the
[1:38:53] different colorations the differences
[1:38:55] among us? I'm talking about in our ideas
[1:38:58] everything and God would so knit
[1:39:01] our hearts together.
[1:39:04] You notice that scripture didn't say
[1:39:05] knits our ideas together.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; But God has left that
[1:39:14] to be proved out that his grace and his
[1:39:18] love
[1:39:19] is greater
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; than all those differences
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; how are we held together? How are we
[1:39:28] stuck together?
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; We're stuck together by the love of God.
[1:39:34] You love me.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:39:38] Amen. We love one another. Ain't God
[1:39:40] good?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; He tempers us.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; He knits us together. Let's stand.
[1:39:58] Bram says it like this. He says,
[1:40:01] "You've made denominations and we have
[1:40:03] it and the rest of them is not in it.
[1:40:06] You're leaving out the love of God, the
[1:40:08] chief cornerstone. I don't care how many
[1:40:11] miracles you can perform, how many
[1:40:13] prophets you have, how many works of
[1:40:15] grace you do, it'll never meet or never
[1:40:18] do anything because the church, the
[1:40:20] church of the living God is melted
[1:40:23] together and cemented by love.
[1:40:30] How tremendous that is.
[1:40:38] Let me give you this scripture here.
[1:40:42] Paul says, "And above all these things,
[1:40:45] put on or sink into charity, which is
[1:40:49] the bond
[1:40:52] of perfectness." Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; And all these in the amplified put on
[1:40:57] love and infold yourselves with the bond
[1:40:59] of perfectness which binds everything
[1:41:02] together completely
[1:41:05] in ideal harmony.
[1:41:14] What an achievement. Paul said, "Though
[1:41:17] I have faith to move all mountains,
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; and have not charity,
[1:41:24] I'm nothing.
[1:41:26] Though I understand all mysteries, have
[1:41:28] all knowledge of scripture.
[1:41:32] But without charity, it's nothing.
[1:41:35] Though I could speak with tongues of men
[1:41:37] and angels, without charity, nothing.
[1:41:43] I could burn my body, give my goods to
[1:41:46] feed the poor,
[1:41:49] but yet without charity, it's nothing.
[1:41:55] See, Paul was
[1:41:57] was showing them that really their
[1:42:00] placement, who they were in the economy
[1:42:03] of God was not defined on whether they
[1:42:06] were gifted or not
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; or had a gift or have something that
[1:42:10] would be notable, but what defined them
[1:42:14] is the love of God.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Because it's God's love. your your life,
[1:42:19] my life. You know what our lives are to
[1:42:21] be like it's like how a picture frame
[1:42:23] you display pictures of your family.
[1:42:28] Sometimes you'll have a collage and
[1:42:30] it'll be a memorial memorial memorable
[1:42:32] events.
[1:42:35] Do you realize that you are God's
[1:42:39] picture?
[1:42:41] Where God himself would so project who
[1:42:45] he is, his love
[1:42:48] through your life.
[1:42:53] What an awesome responsibility.
[1:43:00] Faith is a wonderful thing.
[1:43:03] Is that right? Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; That we we have to have faith. The Bible
[1:43:08] said without faith it's impossible to
[1:43:09] please God.
[1:43:13] But let me just say this to you.
[1:43:17] When brother Brandon went beyond the
[1:43:18] curtain of time, he said,
[1:43:22] he never came back and said, "It's going
[1:43:25] to take faith to get there." He said,
[1:43:27] "Without perfect love, you'll never get
[1:43:30] there."
[1:43:32] Because why?
[1:43:34] those scriptures I just referenced in 1
[1:43:37] Corinthians 13
[1:43:39] for many of the different gifts,
[1:43:41] supernatural in endoomments.
[1:43:47] Many men that brother Ram described had
[1:43:49] such not not all of them were off, but
[1:43:52] there were different ones. They could so
[1:43:54] take the scriptures and explain divine
[1:43:57] healing to like brother Ram says it had
[1:43:59] the devil pinned in a corner.
[1:44:04] He said that's one of the places or ways
[1:44:06] of gifts of healing building the
[1:44:08] people's faith and then working upon
[1:44:11] that of healing dealing with the
[1:44:13] certainty of it. And yet
[1:44:17] that person or that individual
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:21] could absolutely be void of the love of
[1:44:24] God.
[1:44:27] I think friends within this this moment
[1:44:29] as the Lord's been speaking to our
[1:44:31] hearts
[1:44:33] in in your individual in your own life
[1:44:35] in your individual way this is what we
[1:44:38] need to be pursuing
[1:44:40] is the love of God.
[1:44:42] Well, brother Samuel, I I believe I have
[1:44:45] it. I say that's wonderful.
[1:44:48] But Paul would say follow after charity.
[1:44:51] Pursue it.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Look for charity. Where whatever you're
[1:44:56] you're going to do, can you find charity
[1:44:58] in it? What do you mean, brother Samuel?
[1:44:59] What's the motive?
[1:45:01] What's objective?
[1:45:03] That's what Paul was dealing with in the
[1:45:04] opening of 1 Corinthians. If love
[1:45:08] is not the basis, the prophet would take
[1:45:11] us in stature of a perfect man and
[1:45:12] blasphemous names. He said, "If those
[1:45:14] virtues is not what's laying there
[1:45:16] behind it and we know that the measure
[1:45:19] of those virtues, it grows."
[1:45:24] We don't start out up here and my
[1:45:26] goodness, I'm just No, God brings us.
[1:45:30] spirit of God seals away that faith and
[1:45:33] then as we continue to grow in our
[1:45:34] virtue grows patience all those things
[1:45:36] and it's growing all the way on up into
[1:45:39] him in all things.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; But if we if we have everything else
[1:45:46] and we don't have that, we've missed it.
[1:45:50] So I say this, if there's anything,
[1:45:52] anything within you that would not agree
[1:45:54] or allow you, let me say it like this,
[1:45:57] would not allow you to agree with all
[1:46:01] the word of God.
[1:46:04] Why don't you just look to him and say,
[1:46:07] "Lord,
[1:46:09] you're above that.
[1:46:11] You're greater than that." Whatever it
[1:46:14] might be, it might be habit, whatever it
[1:46:16] might be. If there's anything that's
[1:46:17] holding you back, anything that's been
[1:46:19] hindering you,
[1:46:23] God is greater than that.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not asking you whether
[1:46:31] to look at your condition. I'm asking
[1:46:32] you to look at the at the Lord Jesus
[1:46:35] Christ that he is greater. He's able and
[1:46:38] more than willing to break that back. If
[1:46:41] something has held you back from coming
[1:46:43] into position, God's grace is greater.
[1:46:45] Yes,
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; the love of God is greater to bring you
[1:46:48] into that position.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And once he's got you into that place
[1:46:53] and and and putting you placing you
[1:46:55] there within the body, then his grace is
[1:46:58] sufficient
[1:47:00] in our lives
[1:47:05] for us to be able to look beyond
[1:47:08] differences.
[1:47:11] grace to grow beyond
[1:47:14] quarrels,
[1:47:15] offenses.
[1:47:17] Friends,
[1:47:19] let me just say this to you.
[1:47:23] I've worked when I was there in my
[1:47:25] classroom. I know this is a natural
[1:47:27] example, but you know, you learn a
[1:47:29] little bit after a few years.
[1:47:31] There's a lot of things that I would do
[1:47:33] to try to avoid
[1:47:35] issues
[1:47:37] like going on field trips. You didn't
[1:47:39] pick the seats you set in.
[1:47:42] The groups you were with. No, this is
[1:47:44] this is not a fun time. It's a fun time,
[1:47:46] but it's not it's going to be a fun time
[1:47:48] for everybody.
[1:47:50] So, we would assign and I would go
[1:47:52] through all of that.
[1:47:54] Now, look, don't worry. I want no
[1:47:56] military man. God asked that a couple
[1:47:58] times. Was you ever in the military?
[1:48:00] Nope.
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:02] But you know what? I would find over the
[1:48:05] years, as much as I prepared, there was
[1:48:08] still always little things that I would
[1:48:09] find out, open up my folder for that
[1:48:12] field trip, make a note for next year,
[1:48:17] and then I would work upon that next
[1:48:19] year. Of course, you have different
[1:48:20] temperaments, personalities,
[1:48:22] right, the following year.
[1:48:26] You know what? as a body, even you as
[1:48:29] parents,
[1:48:31] as a pastor, bringing it on down into
[1:48:33] here and within our families, we do the
[1:48:35] best we can to try to do what? So that
[1:48:39] there's not
[1:48:41] problems.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; So that there's everything, oh my,
[1:48:47] everything is just exactly right. We
[1:48:50] strive for that. If there's if we don't
[1:48:51] strive for that, I'm talking I'm talking
[1:48:53] about that everything everybody sees uh
[1:48:56] uh you know, we all see eye to eye.
[1:48:57] That's not what I'm talking about.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; As a Christian, you're a lover of peace.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; And you seek that there would be peace.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; But what happens
[1:49:13] when peace
[1:49:15] is troubled?
[1:49:18] What happens when things aren't going
[1:49:19] just exactly? Just right.
[1:49:22] What do we do?
[1:49:25] You say God would permit that. Yeah.
[1:49:28] Brother Bram said, "You take after a
[1:49:29] great service," why Christ speak 1963,
[1:49:31] "After a great service, great meetings."
[1:49:33] He said, "You watch it in about a few
[1:49:35] days before Satan is loose to come right
[1:49:37] among those people
[1:49:40] and try to knock out every bit of the
[1:49:42] confidence that God has put in them."
[1:49:45] Why? God permits it to be tested.
[1:49:51] Brother Samuel, what what is all this
[1:49:53] that you're saying? I'm saying as much
[1:49:55] as we can look at and say, Lord,
[1:49:58] my heart's desire
[1:50:01] is there's things we grow and we learn
[1:50:04] on how to how to take off here, how to
[1:50:07] prevent this, how to administer that.
[1:50:11] But in all everything that we do, we and
[1:50:15] I'm saying me with you,
[1:50:18] we're still learning
[1:50:22] and we're still growing.
[1:50:25] There's certain things that I can just
[1:50:27] with from my heart that I could tell
[1:50:28] you, I wish there's certain things that
[1:50:31] I wish I could take back,
[1:50:34] certain things I would do differently.
[1:50:39] Oh, I
[1:50:41] I know my record's clear before God. But
[1:50:43] I'm just telling you tonight,
[1:50:50] but I know within it all,
[1:50:52] if we'll stay within that place within
[1:50:55] our hearts,
[1:50:57] God, give me the grace
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; to look beyond the differences, the
[1:51:03] ideas. Give me that grace that it can be
[1:51:06] a group of people that as they would say
[1:51:09] regarding the early Christians, how they
[1:51:11] love
[1:51:13] one another.
[1:51:15] You know, ain't it amazing? They didn't
[1:51:17] all say, "My, they all have the same
[1:51:19] ideas
[1:51:21] how they love one another."
[1:51:26] I tell you friends, I think that's a
[1:51:28] real tremendous accomplishment
[1:51:31] of the Holy Spirit in this hour
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; where we're able to look beyond our
[1:51:36] yourself,
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; able to look beyond our differences.
[1:51:40] That's supernatural.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; You may not have walked on water to get
[1:51:44] here tonight, but that's supernatural.
[1:51:46] [Music]
[1:51:48] supernatural home.
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:52:00] I know it's a little bit different, but
[1:52:02] I'm going to ask you if we all can just
[1:52:03] kind of come up maybe towards the front.
[1:52:05] And
[1:52:07] I just like to pray together. I just
[1:52:09] fill my heart to do that. Maybe you slip
[1:52:12] out of your pew. I know maybe not
[1:52:15] everybody can fit here. Maybe
[1:52:17] Maybe a few of you may have to step
[1:52:18] around here up on the platform with me
[1:52:20] and
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:30] but we're a body.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; We may not be big in number but it's
[1:52:37] according to has God as allotted.
[1:52:41] Doesn't mean that it'll always be a
[1:52:43] certain number this or that. We've seen
[1:52:44] things that fluctuate, but we're a body.
[1:52:47] We're not a body because
[1:52:50] we come to the same church. We're a body
[1:52:54] because he has reconciled
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; as individuals
[1:52:59] unto himself, making one new man. And
[1:53:02] then from those new creations,
[1:53:06] he begins to assemble stone by stone by
[1:53:11] stone by stone.
[1:53:14] What's he doing? He's putting himself
[1:53:15] together.
[1:53:17] If there ever was a time that we needed
[1:53:19] one another, we need one another right
[1:53:21] now.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Satan's guns is aimed to want to try to
[1:53:27] divide and conquer. But let me just say
[1:53:29] this, you are more in God's sight than
[1:53:34] the blood that he shed.
[1:53:38] The prophet said, "If I had a charger of
[1:53:40] that literal blood and I would, oh, how
[1:53:42] I would hold it next to my heart and
[1:53:45] say, "Thank you, Lord." He said, "But do
[1:53:48] you realize in his sight I've got that
[1:53:52] which is of a greater and more precious
[1:53:54] price?
[1:53:56] That's the purchase of his ransom.
[1:54:00] It's what God has done."
[1:54:06] I wonder if we just couldn't pray
[1:54:08] together here.
[1:54:10] Ask God, Lord, let our hearts be so
[1:54:14] knitted with you, Lord.
[1:54:17] Because then that supernatural strength,
[1:54:19] it'll work through one another. I I
[1:54:20] believe standing right here, the Holy
[1:54:22] Spirit is right here tonight, right
[1:54:23] among us.
[1:54:25] God's more, he's more than able, more
[1:54:28] than enough to give the Holy Spirit.
[1:54:29] He's able right here tonight to
[1:54:32] minister. Maybe it's weariness.
[1:54:34] God's more than able.
[1:54:39] Maybe if you got a brother standing next
[1:54:41] to you, maybe husband and wife or
[1:54:43] brother to brother or sister to sister.
[1:54:45] Could we just pray together?
[1:54:49] Heavenly Father,
[1:54:52] Lord God,
[1:54:55] without you we're nothing, Lord.
[1:54:59] Lord Jesus, it's through your blood that
[1:55:02] has been shed, Lord God, that you look
[1:55:06] beyond every one of our differences. You
[1:55:08] look beyond the conditions, Lord, we
[1:55:10] were in.
[1:55:12] That Lord, you would come and draw us
[1:55:15] under your love, Lord God, and draw us
[1:55:18] to yourself and change our lives. Lord,
[1:55:23] you would change our nature, Lord. you
[1:55:25] would bring about a unity, Lord God, of
[1:55:29] a new creation.
[1:55:31] And then Lord God, as you would set us
[1:55:33] together, Lord, as a people, a body of
[1:55:36] believers, Lord,
[1:55:38] oh dear God,
[1:55:41] that Lord Jesus, where that desire,
[1:55:44] Lord, and that ferveny of the same Holy
[1:55:47] Spirit, Lord, that came and sought us
[1:55:49] out, dear God, is the same Holy Spirit
[1:55:52] working in our lives, Lord God, even as
[1:55:54] it works throughout the body, Lord, for
[1:55:56] those, Lord, that Father, Lord, as that
[1:55:58] would assemble here, Lord, and hearing
[1:56:00] your voice, But Lord to know that God
[1:56:03] your grace Lord goes beyond Lord the
[1:56:06] circumstances and situations. Lord God
[1:56:09] your grace Lord is able to change Lord
[1:56:11] every life and every heart just as
[1:56:13] you've changed Lord our lives. And Lord
[1:56:16] God, we ask Lord here tonight, Father,
[1:56:19] that you would just give us the grace,
[1:56:21] Lord, that Father, as we stand as a
[1:56:24] body, Lord, to know that the Holy
[1:56:26] Spirit, Lord, you've not come here,
[1:56:28] Lord, to make us to where all of our
[1:56:30] ideas will be the same. that when we're
[1:56:33] all think alike, Lord God, but Father,
[1:56:36] what grace it is, Lord Jesus, that you
[1:56:39] would so temper us together,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; knit us together,
[1:56:44] this bond of perfectness that we are
[1:56:47] called to sink into, Lord. Oh God, I
[1:56:52] pray, Father, bind us together, Lord.
[1:56:56] Bind us together, Lord, with cords that
[1:56:58] cannot be broken. bind our hearts
[1:57:01] together, Lord God. Oh, Father, we might
[1:57:05] share a lot of similarities. We might
[1:57:07] share even certain likes and certain
[1:57:10] tastes and certain hobbies, but Lord
[1:57:12] God, how do you want us to go so much
[1:57:15] deeper than that? Lord, I know you can
[1:57:18] operate, Lord, and move through those
[1:57:20] avenues to bring hearts into that place,
[1:57:24] Lord God, to where, Lord Jesus, that
[1:57:26] reality, Lord, of what unites us is
[1:57:28] greater than our our ages. It's greater
[1:57:31] than our hobbies. It's greater, Lord
[1:57:33] God, than our likes. Oh God, it's
[1:57:36] greater Lord than all of that because
[1:57:39] Lord Jesus, it's the great mortar of the
[1:57:42] Holy Spirit, the pitch of your atonement
[1:57:45] of your own life, oh God, operating in
[1:57:48] our lives, Lord, that unites us with
[1:57:50] you, Lord, and unites us to the Christ
[1:57:54] in one another.
[1:57:56] Oh God granted Lord give strength Lord
[1:57:59] some of your children Lord are weary
[1:58:01] Lord from the battles of life Lord
[1:58:04] pressures Lord and things Lord that
[1:58:06] Father they've been through or in the
[1:58:08] midst of Lord I pray tonight God may the
[1:58:11] spirit of God just go forth Lord here
[1:58:13] tonight Lord strengthen each one Lord in
[1:58:16] a special way God may there be God a
[1:58:19] great renewing Lord I pray of purpose
[1:58:22] Lord God may the Holy Spirit Lord God
[1:58:24] move down Lord into hearts and lives. Oh
[1:58:27] God, that Father, willing and
[1:58:29] surrendered, Lord, to your purpose, Lord
[1:58:31] God. Granted, Lord, I pray, Father.
[1:58:34] Have your way tonight among us, Lord.
[1:58:37] It's you that we love, Lord. It's you
[1:58:39] that we want more than anything else,
[1:58:42] Lord. Oh God, it's in you, Father.
[1:58:45] Everything that we have need of, Lord,
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you are everything, Lord.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord God. Bless these
[1:58:54] musicians, Lord.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Father God, I know not everyone's up
[1:58:59] here, Lord, tonight, but would you bless
[1:59:01] them, Lord, their sacrifice, Lord,
[1:59:05] Father, Lord, to be vessels, Lord, that
[1:59:07] are yielded to you, Lord, Father, Lord,
[1:59:10] to dear God, to play and come under the
[1:59:13] anointing of the spirit of God, not just
