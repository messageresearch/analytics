amen you can turn well let it ring out of our hearts God specializes impossible and we'll do one over Wow [Music] you love him this morning amen just want to just ask you to have your seats just for a moment and just want to it's just so good to be here before we turn to the word and it's good to see CH and every one of you and you know we go through this the season that we are in right now and I'm not just talking about winter but there's times where we to go through and we battle sickness and we battle different things in our bodies and it's just a it's a blessing to be able to come together to be in the house of the Lord you know sometimes there's things that we look at and we wonder why does this happen or why did that happen but you know if in our life and our journey here if everything was smooth and it was easy and our flesh wants that if if if if it was that way we would have no longing to get out of here but God lets little reminders come to you and I whether it comes there in our body or it comes in our spirit or things that come our way he lets he reminds you and I this world is not your home we can see all around us the world is in decay but I think God's mercy and grace that he allows us to know that there is indeed another body that is waiting on us there is there is that which in just a moment we will step right into a matter of fact the Bible says not in it says in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and that word a phrase in the scripture in a moment it means that which is unable to be divided it is that quickly amen I'm grateful that we've got living evidence in our heart that quickly of how God can change when he changes a life just that quickly amen that's a that's a foretaste of glory divine amen aren't you glad about that this morning we miss one another we miss you when you're when you're not here and and and that is true we you know and the sickness and things but we thank God that he's provided for us in this hour for he still is the Lord that healeth all thy diseases amen aren't you glad about that amen well I want to welcome brother Josh and sister Ann Mariah I don't know how y'all got that baby over here with Brian and brother Brian grinning like a possum up here and you know one sister Barbara I'm sure they're they're happy that I know they're happy about it and so we just be glad to have little Eleanor here with us Josh and him arrived glad to have brother Alexander and sister Maria here with us good friends amen amen brother Alexander is really not even a guest here he's stood here in stood here so much in this in this pulpit and I just so appreciate brother brother Alexander sister Maria they're family I appreciate our brothers gift in the Lord and his burden for the people and you know for me as a pastor I just don't look at and most of you know this by now I just don't look at getting somebody in here and I don't go chasing names and I know that when I say that it isn't that we have anything against names but I realize that within every situation and every service who we need to hear from is Jesus and now whatever vessel he's going to use he might choose one that's complexions a little darker than mine might have a little bit more hair than me the who we want to hear from you sin and that is the things that I would I appreciate his how that brother brother Alexander within his ministry within the services that he's been here and I don't just say this because he's sitting here he knows us how I feel our others the Assembly has been benefited by the ministry and that's what I that's my point that I'm making I want ministry in here that benefits the Assembly of the Assembly that don't mean that at times that maybe I hadn't you know with other brothers or other times but I want ministry that have that blessed the Assembly and when I've been away I know one thing that brother Alexander he has has your heart and on upon his heart and I don't have to worry when and when that when when I'm away I know that no matter what would rise here what I've got confidence in is not in the flesh a brother Alexander McCool is I got confidence in in his contact with God so I really I really appreciate that and Alexander we love you you sister Maria god bless you this morning you if you if you're gonna get him get at me for that right there you meet me at the dessert table at the fellowship and we'll sweeten you up amen we want to remember here I want us to remember as most of you probably are aware of that little Liliana we've been praying for that we know that if God doesn't intervene even even now and that's the part that even when I prayed the other night even even now because it's not up to us it's not what what in terms as far as that that we would would say or declare it's God whatever the will of God is these things many times when they happen it's is sometimes the way a situation will go sometimes our mind it's things that we can't understand that this is we're trusting the Lord it comes in and we had prayer there the other night and and I want you to pray for them that's why brother Richard and sister Maria they're not here they'd been up there since Friday and back and forth and we're up there on Friday and we after just having prayer there in the room the group that was all gathered around and just a presence of the Lord so sweetly to come in there and what they were mentioning as I was standing right outside of there right after we even in the moment had had had come forth from prayer she she came to for a moment and she said it's okay so that's that was the part when I was standing there talking with brother Richard and sister Maria and sister Rachel now you say brother Samuel what does that mean I don't know I don't try to figure that out but I know one thing that if it is if it is of her time to cross on over I know one thing that death is not her master it's a servant can I move from this body right into that other body that is the comfort that we know and so we want to pray I want you to pray for for Joshua mr. Joshua - Joshua Sanchez that's the it's a daddy and brother Richard sister Maria one of their sons and also the mother Jaime and asked me to come in and pray and so we want to remember them in prayer within this time and you know I just say it like this I don't look at any situation as though it's over I still come to that city I still come to that even as I prayed that Friday my Friday before going to the hospital I thought of their standing in Lazarus and where Lazarus was there in the tomb and hear the testimony was even now even now and so we we we believe that as as as children of God and whether our healing comes here in this body or it comes when we stand there on the other side either way he's the Lord that he live all our diseases and so I also want to announce here brother brother Shane and sister Lily they have made their agreements to one another they are officially engaged so I'd like to ask for the same in sister Millie up there go ahead and come on up here and we're just gonna have prayer together and would like brother brother Sean why don't you come on up here too brother and we we want to have prayer here this morning we just appreciate the Lord and His his leadership and guidance in our lives we know these are these are big decisions and and yet when God has made this clear when we realized the seriousness of these decisions and yet we recognize like with every other promise in God's Word we don't approach that promise out of fear we trust in the Lord none that God he opens every channel he opens in in his time and in his seed is in his season we can have confidence in his leading and the same God that has led you all States apart but has brought you all together that same God will continue to guide you and lead you amen he'll they'll continue to direct you you don't it's it's a great step but it's a it's a wonderful thing marriage is absolutely wonderful it's that which God has so reserved as a covenant and that you're able to be blessed and be a blessing to one another and serve the Lord together we believe that God is he has brought this through prayer God has made you co-workers together amen helpers together so let's just pray as a congregation amen over this engagement this betrothal and we just want to ask the blessing of the Lord and guidance upon their lives Heavenly Father Lord I prayed your God is Lord we lay our hands and as a congregation we Lord we are so thankful for your mercy and your leadership and guiding Lord upon our lives Lord we know that God the promise in your word that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and we're thankful dear God that Lord for every impulse Lord of the Holy Spirit Oh God that you've given us your word that Lord Jesus that would direct us Lord and father we thank you Lord for this Lord this engagement Lord of brother Shane and sister Lily thank you Lord for their hearts Lord being tender Lord and looking to You Lord God through every step

thank your father for it's in your name in the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things for your glory in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you for the same just a minute god bless you Shawn brother Shawn's got a big smile on his face hey man don't you love the Lord amen well let's stand and we want to go right into the word amen well let's just see how where the Lord will take us here this morning in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 I want to go and read there in Ephesians 10 verse 6 this is finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we've been looking at the thought and I've asked I asked brother Brian we'd sent out in the email when my notes had went out to you a visual that perhaps would help of where Paul would looking at one of these of the soldiers and Paul would the Holy Spirit would begin to inspire to him the armor that is given to us now just like in in in in the natural army and I've never been in the natural army navy or whatever more but I can only imagine that what they would release to you is exactly what you have need of now I don't know if in the natural if they you know if they just give you your you you know your fatigues or BTUs whatever you want to call them before they give you the obviously the dress blues a dress greens of things you're used to dress up and win that they release the weapons I I don't know all of that but I do know one thing that's for sure is that when God releases to us this armor he gives us every part of the armor when he makes the issue of his own life and we're talking about putting on the whole armor of God we're when when Paul is in speaking of this here he is dealing with that of where it is God's own life being filled with the Spirit of God where the word itself becomes flesh within our lives there's no way that you or I would be able or are able are to stand against the enemy or the wiles of the enemy or his deceptive tactic there is no way within our flesh or our mind none of that is a match for the enemy but there's only one that's more than a match for the enemy and that is the Lord Jesus Christ that is the Holy Ghost he can listen he can outsmart he can outfox us in our natural mind and our way of thinking but there's one one there's one that he cannot I do and that's the Holy Ghost he can't outdo the Holy Ghost and when you think of this when you look at it in our life you would look at this when we would see that of a soldier we can see all of that in itself that is is covered there on the outside with all of those different parts and yet when we're looking at it we think of we think of David as we've been looking at this parallel and running this as well because David was indeed one who was anointed to be king of Israel and through David through that anointing then it brought the strength of Israel it brought Almighty God back into power back into position has indeed the king of Israel David would be one that would declare he said he is my king Saul never said such a thing Saul everything was what Saul could do but David let it know that that though I'm King here but yet the king of here I'm only King because he has made me King and this is why that you and I can look at it when the scriptures where it says and that he hath made us kings and priests unto our God we have not made ourselves kings but he has made us kings and priests unto our God he is the king of saints he is our king that now that we are a part in that spiritual Kingdom think of it when David himself would come to that of the battle when David would come to that place in the you know coming there and and and Saul would see him David comes to before Saul with a testimony his testimony before Saul is the Lord hath delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear let me just say it like this this was not long-distance shooting he said out of the paws are you with me this was not like you know David having a rifle you know and being able to take that thing out you know it may be 350 yards away no he was close enough back the breath was upon him you know what I'm talking about when tests and trials and things come that you can actually feel the breath of the enemy but David let it be known the Lord hath delivered me out of the paw of the lion out of the paw of the bear and he let's eat let's he let's all know that he's the same God he'll deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine sometimes there are things what we know as variables things that change but then there's a constant variable and that constant is God no matter what situation it is he still is the same hallelujah now we're looking at this remember when Saul here's David talking and immediately Saul would turn around and say hey go get my armor now Saul's armor was not something that was just kept out here outside of his tent there would be a place within a Saul's tent where this armor was kept there would be people who would watch over this armor and when it came time for Saul to go to battle they would come forth with a coat of mail they would put it on him they would they would put everything and hand to him what was needed when he was going to go into battle Saul was not going to go out there and fight Goliath but Saul calls for no doubt his armor bearer we would know that term in the scripture and here none doubtedly that armor bearer would bring all of these different instruments or our weapons of warfare and Saul would be arming David he put on the coat of mail the scripture tells us that all of these things David put along but David stood there in the midst of it and David said I can't go out with this armor on because I've not proved this you know what David was saying he said Saul you might be able to fight in this armor what's he narrowed it down to everybody's got to have their own personal experience with God you've got to know that that armor was not just a hand-me-down that armor was personally fitted for you and for me for the battle that we would engage let me tell you something the same God that fitted David the same God that fitted Peter that fitted Paul let me tell you something he's never changed the issuing of this armor he's never ever had to change his armor he's never had the study to update that how can we temper it more how can we make it better but this this very armor is the same armor this morning that you and I have the privilege to be clothed in with this same armor it has stood the test of time there are memorials all the way down through scripture that have stood there with this armor of the Lord and clothed there his spirit and they have remained victorious hallelujah the time we're living in you say this time is different but God is still the same God don't ever let the devil try to sell that to you he sold that bill of sale to many of people you'll never get over this you can never overcome that he's a liar I said he's alive because Jesus Christ stripped him of every power of every authority I want you to understand this this morning that devil is a defeated being he has been defeated by Lord Jesus Christ I mean put it in the words of the Prophet he said you're disputing with a defeated death you said what should I do and say come let my backbone be increase let everything rise in my heart and you stand there and call him a liar let us and you he seems this big what should i do say boo back foo-foo-foo-foo food and you watch that devil that seems so big I'll never get over this this mountain is so great take the word of God and safe boot devil boo devil now you might only be able to get out it ain't how loud you are here it's what's back here loose and I don't feel like I got that much faith silence that right now my question to you is do you believe that God keeps all this word do you believe that what God keeps all these word that God fulfills every promise that's the faith you need right there faith in something way out here faith is right there this is where the admonition comes to us in the hour as we've been looking at this where the Holy Spirit would write to the Philadelphian church age which we know that's the age of brotherly love that is the age where God would take a man by the name of John Wesley not John Wesley's choosing this was God that chose and here's the message that would fall upon that age you see you see when we read this where it says in Revelations 3:11 behold I come quickly we know that that was there has been hundreds of years as a matter of fact this scripture was written there it was given by inspiration to John while he was on the Isle of Patmos remember what John was witnessing on the Isle of Patmos is the coming of the Lord of how that God coming back in the form of his word and he would be clothed within his pride he would redeem his bride he goes in to break forth of how that God will come for his bride it moves into the place of how that God will come to visit the 144,000 how that God will even bring you know a Salvation there to those you know that would stand before the white throne judgment in all of these things it speaks of the coming of the Lord and yet you and I can look and say it's been hundreds of years but we know that that is a trick of the enemy because if he can cause you to look as far as in time of our time then we begin to get relaxed with things but if you can recognize that even though we look at 2000 years and even that of Calvary that was just like brother Brown will say like this he said that was just like that to God it was just like that to you and I look back in time and some of you that have had a little bit of years you know that's mounted up on the treads of your tires so to say in your alive you look down and then many times you wonder where did the last five years 10 years 20 years 30 years where in the world did they go tan moves on quickly and to recognize the ammunition of the Holy Spirit behold I come quickly hold fast which thou has and that no man take thy crown he's talking to sons and daughters of God its sons and daughters of God that will respond to the urgency of the Word of God it is something within you not that you have esteemed within yourself to make yourself but it is of the quality of the DNA of the election of God that when the Spirit of God moves on your life and your heart that's why you can't settle with just a status crawl life it's not enough for you just to be a part of of a group of people and come to church and it's something greater than that you see it much deeper in your life and you and you witness to it that the coming of the Lord is upon us I I want to live every day victorious for him I want to live in a manner to where there's no question who's sad I'm all and who I'm represented let me tell you something that is the move of the Holy Spirit upon that seed that's there on the inside not of him that we'll know as him that runneth but of God that shows mercy hallelujah it's impulses it's inspiration of the Holy Spirit that moves upon our life this is why brother Branham would pick up that statement and he would speak to us and say we've got a word for this hour it's to persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God use every weapon he has given us we're not in a parade that comes on resurrection morning come on now we were not in a parade right now we're in a battle just so you know you don't even come to church with your dress blues on there'll be a day for you to put them on there'll be a day when there's a change coming but in the meantime you're hearing your fatigues and your btus you're here reporting for duty you've got shoes that need to be shot you've got a belt that's kind of get tightened up every once in a while gets a little slack gets a little loose and you've got to tighten it up is that right all of these parts together that wants the army issues these weapons there is not a sergeant going to come around you know that's why for many it's good you know and then maybe they go because now mama ain't gonna be coming and straighten them up and mama ain't gonna be doing this and mama ain't gonna be doing that it's okay for a mama to do some things but there is a part of it where it comes to a place you got to be able to stand on your own two feet the sergeant is not going to come in there and say hey hey you know what I got your boots for you you got a busy week I'll take care of your boots for you the sergeant said you're busy this is life as a soldier but still other you know my shoes you know it's been a hectic week there will be inspection outside of the barracks and I expect your shoes to be shod with the preparation of the gospel free ends why would that sergeant that would be a platoon sergeant why would he make such a stand in that way he said because he does not love his men no quite the contrary he loves his men to such a place to wear when there's times that they don't feel like going just to let him know you must go on and every detail is important for victory because after all it is the little foxes that spoil the vine so we want to say get rid of that carefree attitude or well count on mind God understands and God cares and every once in a while the Lord has to drop us for some push-ups you know push-ups our humility face before the dirt to let us realize you have no strength and no power on your own I am your strength I am your defense I am your all-in-all oh you say brother Samuel we don't need that oh yes we do need it Paul needed it Paul matter of fact packing around the revelation of Jesus Christ greater than any of those other men that had it but he would say to you and I that he said there was a messenger of Satan that was given to me to buffin me in the flesh he would pray get better then it would come back pray get better then it would come back why was this lest I should be exalted above concerning the abundance of revelation that's given to me I'll be honest and you can be honest too if it was up to you and I to try to keep ourselves in that place I believe that we all just say law helped me to stay humble but God knows exactly what you and I have made out that you and I can even be equipped and be helped to stay in a place of humility oh boy I don't get somewhere today I don't want we'll get somewhere notice this use every weapon he has given you so these are not weapons that you put up on the wall and I'm going to mount these on my wall no you got to use them and use every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is our king of kings and Lord of lords now let's look at this let's break in on this here we've looked at some of the first part of our armor let's look in here into the shield of faith enact in Ephesians 6 verse 16 it says above all taking the shield of faith and that word above all it was not so much speaking of that it's more important than the rest of them but the word above all means to put this upon or before there were times where the shield would have to be up because the flights of arrows and things were becoming from above there are times where it's got to be moved to the side there are times where it's got to be in front of the soldier but notice above all in other words above or in position between you and the enemy taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked Balarama would pick it up like this and greatest never fought makes just a simple statement that's the one he says that knocks off the darts now if you notice when we look at the shield let's look at the shield here just a few moments in Genesis 15 1 here is where the Lord would speak to Abraham in a vision and says fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward now think about this when this is made known to Abraham this is exactly when Abram remember heard about lot was taken captive and lot had nope our to withstand the enemy but Avram because of the separated life notice his name had not even been changed yet are you hearing me this morning his name had not even been changed yet if we can say like this Abram had not even received the Holy Ghost but it shows the power of a separated life before God when you will separate yourself according to the Word of God you receive authority of the word backing you up and the Bible says Abram took his trained armed servants and they went after all those kings these were kings these were rulers but Abram was under the leadership of the king himself and notice after coming out of this panel fear not I am thy shield wonder how many times that Abram but there were things that came along his pathway that tried to take his life will be life suck you and me I wonder if God would let us know how many times this week where Satan has attempted to try to take our lives whether it's this week or the week before but to think about how that God himself has been right there as a shield around our life we walk every day when you step into the schools you step into the hospitals you step into the stores you walk in your neighborhoods there are demons all around there are spirits all around it isn't just saying well we don't live near this section of town there ain't so many Devils over here know some of them educated devils are more worse than all the demons of prostitution and alcohol and everything else it's those old religious demons they are some of the worst devils that there are but he let it be known to Abram don't you worry about where you go when I moved upon your heart I want you to know that I am thy shield aren't you glad you've got a shield Oh hallelujah Deuteronomy 33 29 happy art thou o Israel some you need to let your face know that this morning who is like unto thee o people saved by the Lord the shield of thy help second samuel 22 verse 1 and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul now this inspiration for this song it came out of a victory and want nothing against the songs that David already had in the songbook but David received the fresh song from God of an experience in his life and David said you know what since Bob just gave me this inspiration I think I'll sing it for a special are you with me well he may not have been in the only belief songbook but it came from only believed in God in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield not was not will be he is my shield in him will I trust and the Horn of my salvation in my high tower my refuge my Savior thou save us me from violence Psalms 1830 and then funny when we begin to read this right here so looked at David and said boy you ain't got no armor David said you just can't see it David's testifying out his armor this was not something that David was you know a soul man showmanship David was testified on his armor from a personal experience if you can really look at it this morning the shield of paint that you're carrying it might be ever so tattered there might be parts of the leather opponent letter somewhat ripped but I'll tell you it has kept you safe this far that Shield of faith has quenched many fiery darts and when the enemy says get up give up it ain't no use that ain't workin you said the belts on tight I'm standing here by the grace of God I am not letting down my shield [Applause] well let's let him testify a little bit more Psalms 1830s for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is trying he is a buckler that shield to all those that trust in him somes 28-7 the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore o my heart greatly rejoice it there's the difference bestia if it's trusting in ourselves it's fear but if we can just have it so it trust in him then we can rejoice what the victory already belongs to us Lord I'm going to trust in you well I don't understand it trusting is not about that you understand you simply know that we sing this morning we've got rivers that are impossible we've got mountains that we can't tunnel through but our trust is in the Lord how's this gonna be I don't know how God's going to bring it to pass but it is in his hands he is my help therefore my life greatly rejoices and with my sound o glory be to God with my song I will praise him David but you don't see every II don't see every enemy defeated oh no yes I do in him I am help he is my strength there might be things that I'm dealing with right now but my song is going to praise him see what needs to happen is you need to get your hearts off your willow trees some you've been taken captive in your minds come on like Israel got taken captive down into Babylon we might have got taken captive in our minds there might have been places where you've been taken captive don't don't you let that heart sail on that willow tree you go up there and get that heart down and say I'm going back to Zion I'm going back to the place where I can sing the songs of Zion I'm going right back to that place you might say right here well I'm still hearing this remember it is your heart when your heart makes contact with God it can be rock rock back into that place in fellowship with pod to where you can say Lord I am gonna let my song praise you Psalms 91 one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow or the protection of the Almighty don't believe this how do how will say of the Lord this is gonna notice I will say of the Lord this heaven that's a good father I think I'm gonna cut that out and put on my frigerator you didn't say I will put it on my fridge rater I will say not just when everything's going right I will say this is my testimony of who I know him to be I will say of the Lord he is my refuge my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler Oh God did you rehear what that you said it didn't say that you would not fall into snares and traps along the way it said he shall surely deliver me from the snare of the flower blow repeat Oh God and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day brother Brennan was said just like this with that shield of faith in one place of the message he said oh my this great armor of God all he said that helmet of salvation this great big shield the size of a door of faith the actual word and term of shield is first known as a door before it ever became an instrument of protection where a soldier would wear it it was first known the word that is used was first known as a door and let me tell you something there ain't a wolf that can get in the sheepfold it's got to come through the shepherd the Shepherd he don't have up a wooden door with all kinds of gates and bars the Shepherd is the door him set the Shepherd lays down in the door there's not a wolf there's nothing can get by him he is there laying in the door it would have to cross over him to be able to even get to you he is our shield so we're not fighting with a little you know looks like a little dish as we'll get into in a moment this is not the Sun this is not the shield's that was given out that after the Romans many years we read in 300 BC these are not the little round shields that we're talking about or Paul was descriptive describing to you and I notice in David solves three one I'm sure we can relate to this when David was fleeing from Absalon this was not Seoul now this was things within the family come on now it was important that remember remembered tests and trials will come but remember don't use your armor on one another that sword is deadly no use it on one another just redirect how do I recognize many times how brother branham would tell us he said recognize it's not your brother it's not your sister that's doing that it is a spirit that is doing that this is spiritual warfare oh my that's where it comes down with families and everything else well we could just preach a family message right now notice this Lord how are they increased that trouble me let's just be honest every one of us been there Lord how are they increase that are troubling me shield of faith many are they that rise up against me many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in God now let me remind you this is not pre Goliath this is not pre Barre pre lion this is after this is post de life let's say man what are you trying to say that devil never lets up never lets up he doesn't say he foreknew defeated alot he'll be right back there the next day many there be that say of my soul there is no help for him in God right now it would be a good time to have a good praise break right now because there were a lot of Devils that wrote you and I all if said there ain't no help for him you can't help him his life is too messed up his life is in too much shambles look at their life their life is a mess merely said of my soul there is no help for God for him in God but here's the response but Thou O Lord are a shield for me my glory and the lifter of my head hallelu you are not the devil's punching bag he's your punching bag are you with me you're not his sparring partner where is enemy trained with knockout punches don't sit there and take it on in David ends that scripture in verse tell with an important Lord said but Thou O Lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of my head every one of us sitting here have been in this place not just way out in the past you know he's the one that gives you the strength to lift your head encouragement to keep going on and as a faithful soldier here you are your use and every gift at your disposal Lord at Northam an of God you know what I've got need of right now if my shoes need to be tightened up if my belt needs to be tight enough Lord whatever this need is in my life because sometimes we don't even know exactly what they need is but we simply know that we're needed we said Lord that gift that you place there that gift is for me that gift of healing is for me that gift of tongues is for me that gift of a pastor apostle teacher evangelist prophet every one of those gifts are from me the gift within the song leader that's for me every one of those gifts are at my disposal no repeater God sums 511 but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice huh let them ever shout for joy Wow is this a workup no it's not a workup because thou defend us then how in the world can you have junk because of who's defending me if I'm looking at myself I've got enough reason to be down but I'm looking to him who defends me let them also that love thy name be truthful in the Psalms 5:12 for thou Lord will bless the righteous with favor wilt thou compass him surround him as with a shield sounds like David knew what battle he knew this was warfare he knew this was a constant war but the Greg he knew he was engaged every day of his life that's why brother Ram will take it in the message contest he said many people believe he said he said that you know the Holy Ghost is nothing but a good thought he said them same people believe that the devil is no more than a bad thought he said that once he said God got a hold of my life he said I run headlong into him every day we run headlong into the devil every day but listen our life is not bound up in fear I don't know what tomorrow holds I don't know what the next day holds but I know who is defending me [Applause] the devil wants to shoot his darts of worry try to make us worry try to get it upon us mind trying for us to think about it but remember who's defending you Psalms 119 114 thou art person thou art my hiding place and my shield I hope in time word proverbs 30 verse 5 every word of God is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him oh my brother Brendan would pick it up like this or he says the name of the Lord or there is a tower where the righteous run into and are safe he said aren't you glad to be in there tonight the great safety zone where all the devil's darts are passed away by our Shield of faith to know that we are standing in that safety zone anchored in Christ safe as we can be in there not even death itself can harm us we've already died our lives are hidden God through Christ sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what a shield that we have what a protection that we have around our lives now watch how David you know David would bring this even more personal I believe it's personal but notice how David would bring this around in science second Samuel 22 verse 35 he teaches my hands to war no wait a minute brother Sammy you said I'm to have joy in him because he's the one that's defending me he is but he's using you it's not so much he's using your flesh he's seated there in the seat of power in the throne of your heart he's not seated in your spirits come on now but he is seated right there as the ruler of this city this is why the Bible would say in the book of Proverbs greater is he that rule of his city than he that taketh the city [Music] because there's gates into this city and you've got a rule over those gates of imagination conscience reasoning and so forth but we rule by the power of God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost the armor of God in our soul what are you saying we need the shield of faith when our soul has been sealed it's got the shield of God right over it the devil can never I don't care what the devil came to you with once that seal had once that seal of the Holy Ghost has moved on that soul and that nature has been changed there is nothing that can touch that soul and as a matter of fact before the seal was ever put on there what nothing could touch it the devil tried to take your life come on now it was just like Moses Moses was a little baby and here is mama put him there in that Ark and she put pitch Oh glory to God she put pitch on that little art and she sent that little Ark down the river there were alligators or crocodiles forgive me for not being politically correct they were glowing right down that river there were crocodiles in that school I mean in that climbing in that collagen and I made it down that Street there were crocodiles all the way but I will tell you something there was a token that middle I look pitch of the Holy Ghost has been applied holiday Bella bottom said when every crocodile would come up on that he said that crocodile would go to open its mouth and get a little whiff of that pitch turn away I'm telling you he's a shield on your family he's a shield on your family how alone he teaches my hands toward so this is evident that you and I have something to do so we just didn't get this armor that they've been displaying up there we just didn't get this armor and we come around and sit down I mean really sitting around in that kind of armor that's uncomfortable you don't want to sit around that kind of armor and say hey let's go for a steak dinner not in that kind of armor that armor is put on to fight with brother Samuel it seems like test after trial after test after trial when do I get rest you ask the question on me the time said we ask God for the rest for peace and he gives us the best that he can give us tests and trials tests and trials he said but what he does he said those tests and trials are like horses he just puts bits in their mouth and he makes them obey Him you see it's working out for purpose of God for his glory he said right here we're going through tests and droughts but our rest comes just across river in the meantime he teaches my hands to war verse 36 of that same chapter valve hast also given me the shield of thy salvation so this he is our shield he is our protection those who put their trust in him those who trusting in his word he is our defence and he has given us a shield let me tell you the same kind of shield he's given it's not a lesser quality this is the same shield that the second Adam came with hey Matt wear one of God's daughters in the beginning in the Garden of Eden she let go on that shield but here is one who stood right in the midst of battle with the issue remember the Bible said he came with righteousness as a breastplate he came with the shield of faith he never defeated the devil as one who was in mighty power he never defeated the devil with a divine gift or the supernatural in his life he defeated him as a son of God by the Word of God he's our shield he's our protection now notice this let me just try to bring this in here just a little bit we'll see where we can maybe just to get to a little spot here this morning and saw Amen in Ephesians 6 16 again above all taking taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench Oh somebody say all the fiery darts of the wicked not just some of them brother joy all of them all of them this shield of faith above all in position in between upon our lives in between us and the enemy notice as it said the focus that Paul draws we understand that a shield this times where you're going to have swords they're going to be sword fighting going on but Paul doesn't draw the attention to that of the sword Paul draws the attention that with this shield of faith you'll be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one that word quench it means to extinguish or to put out things that are caught on fire so I need the shield of faith you need to seal the faith to do what is sting guaa sh or quench the shield of faith does not stop the devil from firing fiery darts but the shield of faith can put out the fire that's why we need it now let's look here just a little bit here at this shield just for a few moments this shield itself it was rectangular in shape just like what brother brian has up there it was rectangular in shape it was about two foot wide and four foot long this shield that that was given and Paul was taken this inspiration from it was a shield that was given to protect the body it was a shield that many of the Roman mothers would tell their boys when they went out they would say let that shield not only protect you but if there should happen to be conflict let it be a buyer ABI ier which would be like that which would carry back to your body and bring your body back home to me for a proper burial this is how large or how big that this shield was you can understand with just even if it was a smaller shield but let alone it's a big shield like this you to have everything else in place and tightened up the belts got to be tight you can't afford to be dragging your sword you can't afford that because you have this shield that is in front of you now the shield itself oh my it would weigh you know a great amount already I think it was you know somewhere well I don't want to quote exactly the figure this morning but within that the shield itself would be made up of that of wood and it would have a certain thickness of it of wood it would be on the on the part of the shield that you and I would see right there that part he would be all covered on the outside with leather it would cover it with leather now in the midst of the battle when they were in the midst of let's say a sword fight they would actually take that leather and they would point or put oil upon it and anoint the leather with oils so that the swords would just move off of that shield very quickly and that wonderful how powerful it is to be under the anointing of the Holy Ghost it takes more than just being in a good service you need to say Lord let the leather of this line let it absorb the oil of the Holy Spirit because I'm gonna be in hand-to-hand combat no doubt this week but I want my shield oil up real good to wear when I meet the devil and he tries to run that sword he tries to wear me out with quotes tries to wear me out with scriptures I want that seal to be Psalm 19 there with the oil of Almighty God that the sword will slip right off of him there was also more care to this shield when the soldiers were aware because there was things that you would realize that between the warfare there was advancements in their techniques that they would use so they would come into ways to try to counteract this advancement so there would be what Paul was talking about firing darts when the soldiers themselves before going into battle knowing that they might be possibly heading into or before an enemy where there's gonna be fiery darts even when they did not know this they would take their shields and they would set their shields down the in water and they would leave them shields in water over night they would go to sleep and leave him in water overnight you know why because the shields would soak up the water now the shields would be heavier to carry but they would have water in them that when that fiery dart would go to come they'd be able to hold up that saturated shield that was saturated with water and that would actually absorb or it would establish that fiery dart that would come but then as the day would wear on sometimes maybe lunch time comes around dinner time comes around it's no longer Southie wet no more and about that time you're on your way home or you're getting ready to leave and here comes you should shield faith and it's not saturated with water no more lights on it it starts to burn you know the tendency and the reason that this was used among soldiers why beginning me would use that is because when they would fire that fiery dart it would be me would look like they're just like a comet that was going through and if you get light upon that shield and the shield it looked like oh my goodness it's on fire it would be a temptation for the soldier to throw down his shield you understand me now it ain't Sam that very fiery darts that won't hit you humor times you'll feel the flame no doubt you have you feel the flame of those charts sometimes they come all around your like my goodness this flame but remember you have a shield that's able to estill this fiery darts these things were amazing very amazing when you think of it why would we need the shield of faith to quench the fiery darts of the enemy why would we need them we have on the whole armor of God well the whole armor of God part of it is the shield of faith it's because when you got the Holy Ghost one part of you got sealed there's two parts of you that's still highly combustible there's still two parts of you that went fiery darts come that can be inflamed come on now now these fiery darts this is really this is really something here you look at how that they would study this and they would take pieces of cane I guess like sugar cane they would take pieces of cane someone would use some different things but they would make sure that it was Hollow and they're thin that hollow part they would actually put flammable liquid many would use alcohol they would use combustible liquid and they would fill up the actual shaft of that arrow just so happens I've got one here they would fill up the shaft of that arrow with flammable liquid they would take the end of it and the tip of it they would take that tip and they would wrap it or dress it in tow or pitch so they could light it on fire and it was tied here on the inside so what would happen when they would fire out these arrows were the Joey what would take place as soon as that arrow would hit it was made in such a way that the tip itself having all of that would disengage when it disengaged as soon as that arrow hits you the liquid would go over you and the fire that was on the pitch would ignite the liquid that they put in there sounds like the devil don't he knows how to fire temptations he knows how to fire things that are like come on now he feels it with flammable liquid but remember greater is he that is in you glory be to God now let's look here just a moment let me let me just you know skip here just just for a moment brother branham would make a statement like this when when we're looking at it within that of temptation and things that would come our way and when look at this and how than in our lives we would face or feel these fiery darts that would come our way he would he would go on and he would speak of how that the fiery darts themselves would try to come at us he would speak of how that in our lives once our lives we have been filled with the Spirit of God or he would go on to say when you say you've got the Holy Ghost he said you have become a target you walk around I walk around with the target on us and that target is the seal of the Holy Ghost let me read this to you is it possible brother Ram says for a Holy Ghost field person to be driven to do minor things influence to do minor things that he doesn't want to do he said oh yes sir a Holy Ghost field person you're writing the place then to be drove by these things you just put yourself up a target when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slouch around any way you want to but once you take a stand for Christ you've got on the other side then he trains every gun right around on you you ever think he's picking on you guess what he is every temptation everything that could be thrown to you then you got it but what have you got greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world now notice he says you wasn't in a battle here you was just slopping along but now you've cleaned up you've dressed up you shaved you clothes your hair you put on a uniform you got a gun in your hand let's go you're in a battle not to show off but to fight fight sure when the temptations rise winter with the spirit the shield of faith buck it off and move on notice have simple buck it off and move on don't try to out quote the devil Jesus never tried out quote the devil because I'll tell you right now you and I try to out quote him he ain't come out for you and all you say it's just the scripture oh no he knows how to put the message quotes together too he knows how to put scriptures and quotes together and come at you well well well he said below you put on that whole armor of God why do you put on an armor if you're not gonna fight that's a good question in it all soldiers are dressed to fight not to show off walk out and say I'm so-and-so I'm a Christian see Who I am I'm belong to so-and-so hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost here they're not sure nothing bothers me anymore he said brother I believe you better go back and try again I'm telling you when as soon as you hey you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got every gun right on you shooting you but then you got the whole armour of God take the shield of faith the sword of the Spirit take the buckle shod yourself with the gospel take the old middle piece here the breastplate and pull up the shin the cinch on it pat yourself up a little bit and get ready cuz it's coming don't you worry you're gonna have plenty of trouble but once again he says it but remember greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world now notice the scripture let me just try to bring this down here to one part of it this morning the scripture tells us in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report now the good report wasn't that they never got down the good report wasn't that they didn't have any fiery darts shot at that's not the good report the good report was is how the faith itself in their lives equip them with overcoming power they were at the end of the chapter at the end of Hebrews 11 God's Hall of Fame they subdued kingdoms there's some statements that are within there there are certain phrases in there that if you or I had the choice it'd be just like in our own lives we would take all the subdued kingdoms we would take the part man they stopped the mouths of lions about remember they were in the lion's den I'm all about it they were there and Daniel could feel their hot breath on him God could have slayed every one of them lions but he didn't he just came down and had fellowship with Daniel in the lion's den come on now everybody knows that animals are afraid of fire let me tell you something he who wants to portray himself as a roaring lion he the fire to come on somebody I'm talking about the devil he who roars and roams about seeking whom he may devour but this plant within the scripture these brothers and sisters they felt the fiery darts but the shield of faith that they were given it was a present tense faith it was that faith that was delivered to them and their faith would date the shield of faith and hold it in that hour of temptation let me close with this but the Bannerman's praying here he said lord maybe there's some here that's sick and weak and needy Lord they're Christians Satan has shot his arrows they've connected to and he went over the top of their shield of faith and anchored but thou art the great doctor come Lord Jesus and remove the dark pour in the soothing healing oil and bandage it up by the word and may they go out of here tonight well granite Lord thou art al-sharia the breast had won the breasts of God the life giver the nurturer the sustainer of life and the all sufficient one he said there may be those who have grown weary in the way this is another quote you know when they would fight them when they would fire these fiery darts after at the beginning of that campaign when you studied when this these opposing forces would come at one another the enemy would take fiery darts it was just one fiery dart they would fire here's the wording a barrage of Pyrrha darts and it was so dead in such a way to where it wasn't just you're looking and saying oh yeah well there was a fire here you see a fire and our lunch over there anybody could see it coming head-on at yet but they were fiery darts coming from this way fiery darts coming this way fiery darts coming this way tests and trials coming this way sickness coming this way temptation coming this way pain coming this way and seemed like all around you know why they did that what's to induce panic why does the enemy fire you say brother Samuel it seems like I'm battling with sickness or I've been battling with this why it's a barrage of fiery darts what's it what's the whole tactic is to get us to us we throw down a ship what's it's on fire you've got the shield of faith not that he would not not that fire itself wouldn't try to start but a shield of faith will put it sickness can burn then your body temptation can burn down into your spirit the fairy is a shield of faith that is able to quench the fiery darts I don't know about you but sometimes when those darts go to fly let's Emmie how often they fly just like they fly on you sometimes those darts get the flying all around and the first thing you know tested trials coming this way situations here how you gonna handle this how you gonna deal with this well now how are you gonna dress this it's things all over all around that's going on now what I can do which sometimes I do and you do probably do not know what about doing have I done someone in mind I'm out of your will and the enemies like he's paying attention to the fiery darts they're getting it's inducing panic you see the vibration coming off of him right now he's not praying in peace he's anxious somebody help me preach him out what's happenin devil said look he's questioning he's questioning he's lookin Lord am i pleasing to You Lord Am I there you know what did I do some wrong why is this coming around a barrage of fiery darts sometimes as soldiers we get weary now be honest with you and I don't take anything away from a young Christian but when I was a young Christian I never understood that as a matter of fact my dad was preaching one time at the other church we were renting and he was talking about how beginning me would come in him I was sitting on the front row many of you would that were part in that today over there gathering at a church and I just it just came out how loud I said you got to be kidding me you know why I said that because I had not been in that part of the battle yet but here was a battle-scarred veteran that was standin victorious that new one it was locked when he was get up in the morning and the devil say God don't love you look at you sick again look at you gotta take these pills look at you he don't even care about you he'll heal others you've laid your hands on others and look at you you still walk in these conditions preach with me now you say what does that have to got to do with the shield of faith faith worketh by love love produces faith [Applause] just so you know I don't care what you already know I don't care how long you've been serving the Lord you don't get a golden Buckeye card that you can hand in and say this is break day devil see how long I've been in a message 35 years break day every Friday's break day for me you know that every Friday in your nose sound like an wearing my sweat shirts on Friday this is day off devil do D day off devil or when you get to a certain place in your walk with God and how the enemy look want to come around and tell you you ain't got no experience with God you ain't got no power with God you said brother sender would he do that he came right in the prophet's bedroom and said you don't have one bit of power with God but the Rebbe said he was like the old Ali you found the cartoon characters cackling in the corner come on now with all that being said tighten it right up and realize you're not as odd as you thought you were that's only a devil's tactic to try to single you out and make you feel like nobody else goes through this you must be an oddball he's a liar he is one who's come time and time again he is a liar don't let your shield of faith down take that shield of faith I'm gonna renew my strength in the Lord haha he does care about me he does love many he sends me his word he encourages me I'm gonna use every gift at my disposal what are you saying pick up your shield soldier that shield will put out that poverty I just love you what I love you I love the Lord let me read this as you stand there may be those here Lord who've grown weary in the way weary where you mean a real soldier of God can grow weary yeah but there's one part of you there is no weary when you've been born of the Spirit of God you can have joy in the midst of your trial now that don't mean that you're you know dancing and shouting and your rejoicing is in that way but your rejoicing is Lord you're my deliverer you're making a way through this you know what's happening sister Rita you know what happens when you say it like that it's taking that shield of faith and those fiery darts for the joy it's been fired and Men that blaze coming behind it and comes upon you and that flammable liquid bricks all over you gets in your mind you get to thinking it gets in your feelings in your spirit but the shield of faith says I've never seen the righteous forsaken God knows just how to give you the word that you have need of in that hour he is my shield I will say of the Lord he said let them know Lord I love this I know it simple let them know Lord that we never come to a picnic went through a battleground that statement may not I hope it means something to you but it might seem like you and look at say well yeah we're in a battleground I know I'm not the picnic no know what that was meant let them know Lord that the battle they're not odd they're not strange they're not different they're in a battle let them know the fighting bet they're in right now how did the wearisome you know the Bible says be you're not weary in well-doing all right placing six sometimes we get weary we get weary and warring things off a soldier gets weary gets tired that's why we have to have refreshment we've got to come back to the house of God we've got to get our shields anointed with oil we've got to take that shield off we can put it right there in the water that fountain that's open in the house of David and let it soak up and become saturated in his presence Lord let him know we never come to a picnic but to a battle ground fights every inch of the way give them courage strengthen them there's some here Lord that's been wounded the enemy has shot darts of sickness into their body and afflictions their warriors laying here on the battlefield that would be up and going if they could but they must be taken to the inn where the caretaker is at father may the ambulance of God carry them to a real genuine faith this afternoon that they will be healed [Music] he's a doctor he's the chief physician and he don't have to refer you over to a specialist it just so happens he is the specialist you're wary you're wounded maybe this we stop right here where he may be in your mind weary in your spirit may be wounded maybe a dart has hit there in one of the flammable parts of your life in your body and then the enemy will want to work upon that dart that contact and with that flammable liquid well God's feelings others with that you say what the problem of speed your faith must not be great at all there must be some in your life that's wrong come on somebody where the devil would want to work with that flammable liquid Stratos with the sickness but as a child of God you've got a right to stand there to know that God will not hold anything from you if it's something even that's not right in your life you can be as simple as this right now and say Lord forgive me and cleanse me right now and you know what that does that invites the ambulance of the Holy Spirit to move you off the battlefield and into the medic tent glory be to God in to his great pavilion where he's able to administer to you great spiritual vitamins [Music] maybe it's a little bit of a depleted of strength within your life I'm glad he's got an IV hallelujah he's got an IV that he can hook up he knows exactly how much trip needs to go in you become dehydrated on the battle Laura it wasn't that I tried to be hot I know you didn't try to be dehydrated but I see you're dehydrated you've got weak I know if you wonder hydrated you be right back out there on the battlefield front but you got a little dehydrated in your walk so I sent the medics to come pick you up and bring you into the tent so I could nourish you and get you back on the battlefield aren't you glad for that

Lord Jesus how we're so thankful for this great armor Lord you never gave us this armor just to be as something we would put on to show off now every bit of what has been issued to us is to be used it must be used when I look across the congregation or Jesus there's different ones the Lord they've been serving you Lord some right here before I was ever born they're still standing strong if we could pull them up here tonight right here this morning and ask them it's fire adults the primary darts come your way and they tried the light upon your body in your spirit in your mind no doubt Lord they would stand right here and say oh yeah but I want to testify that's what they would do I want to testify this shield of faith that he gave me this shield of faith years later it's still quench and fiery darts though repeat of God I'm dependent on him he's the one that's been defending me he's giving me strength he sent gift after gift message after message refreshment after refreshment he has ministered to me just what I needed Lord Jesus and for us is younger even some Lord that are younger in the way than myself may they take courage to know Lord God that same shield that is given to them is the same shield that our chief captain hallelujah when he came down from glory he came with this same shield of faith it's a same issue Lord glory be to God it's not a second handed rope this is not a second handed shield it is that same issue of the shield of faith or God as a young person when they go out Lord many different tests and trials and things that comes their way in the schools on the jobs different places all around and may may the Lord God may they not let down that shield of faith then they they take that Shield of faith and quench every fiery party Lord those that are
