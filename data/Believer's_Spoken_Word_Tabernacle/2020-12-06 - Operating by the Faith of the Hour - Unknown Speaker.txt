person where we're able to come together on next sunday december 13th and uh through out the midst of each of this time this has certainly um been new new territory for us and the thing that i am just so thankful for is the leadership of the holy spirit throughout each of these times uh we certainly are living in in troublesome times we see things around us that in that taking place and sometimes there's things that we have to respond and we have to react but i certainly thank god that he is he's the one leading us and it's not it's not our our feelings it's not uh not us but it's him that's leading us and we just we want to just greet each and every one of you remember to there are some things that i'll cover a little bit on thursday it's a very brief email it just has some points in it that we're just i'm asking that you would uh follow one of those those points as we come back together so that email uh sister roseanne lord willing should be sending that out tomorrow morning it's everything is set and ready to go for that so lord willing we will resume the services here in december 13th which is next sunday we want to just also to remember one another in prayer different needs that have been among us and uh i know that here different prayer requests were read here this morning and we certainly want to also reiterate congratulations to brother drake and sister rebecca on welcoming little sophia and we are just so grateful for the mercy of the lord i want you to also that we as we continue to remember one another in prayer uh also i didn't hear this read perhaps it wasn't put in but i want to remember mr shirley kress in prayer that the lord will just continue to strengthen her also brother bill sanchez the lord will just continue to strengthen our brother as well we want to just turn our attention to to the word of the lord here this morning and i have a little bit of a maybe a little bit longer passage of reading from for our text this morning but we want to look in james chapter 2 this morning and just to look to the lord so perhaps as you are turning there and to look at that let's just go to the lord in prayer and you have a request upon your heart that you would like to make known to the lord but just to know that god is mindful to minister to our needs and to our hearts just what we have need of heavenly father lord as we just come before you lord this morning how thankful we are o god for your mercy and your strength lord in this hour we thank you father for your leadership oh god you are faithful lord you lord have not left us you don't leave us lord in a state of wandering or limbo but oh god you're faithful to direct the slow in the midst lord of each moment of our life lord and the thing that is so wonderful it's not just lord that we need you in times of trouble or chaos or lord of a test of a trial but lord we need you every single moment of our life lord you're our life lord jesus and we're depending on you lord we're not depending on our abilities lord all that we could have lord dear god even what would be considered good or good qualities without it being under your oversight oh god it's nothing lord so father we our trust is not in you as paul would write of even the stock lord that he come from lord with benjamin and coming dear god from that of israel and the teachers that he was under lord and dear god being a very great learning man but yet within all of that paul had met one who was greater than all of his learning and all of his ability he met the god of abraham and lord jesus we are so thankful lord that we have met you lord god like that of moses when he stood there lord he recognized his littleness he recognized his weakness and he recognized the greatness of his need of you the lord in order for the promise to be fulfilled it would take you lord coming o god in the form of your word by your spirit and fulfilling your word so lord we just want to yield of ourselves lord and ask that you'll come minister to the hearts behind every hand oh god i ask may the holy spirit lord just move in every living room and every place lord where as the children of god are gathered together lord may your holy spirit lord just take control speak through these lips of clay oh god here lord i pray through us lord we love you and we thank you lord and we just have a confidence lord your word he will not return to you boy but it will accomplish lord what you have intended lord to be achieved so we just give ourselves to you now lord and we ask it all for the glory of god in the name of jesus christ amen as we look here in james chapter 2 i want to look at this we are looking in genesis 22 where we've been speaking from and i just want to deal with this part of it um within abraham's life and what we're seeing there are many parts and many um points that are there within genesis 22 that speak of the culminating in abraham's journey which is the same place that we are as the seed of abraham we are the seed of abraham by the holy ghost that same faith moving within us we are in that same place that abraham was brought to and so we want to look at this here this morning in james chapter 2 verse 14. the bible says what does it profit my brethren though a man say he hath pay and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto him depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit now hear how james is writing by inspiration faith itself has works with it now remember here's he just referred to a word that's spoken to address a need be be clothed be warmed but you see the word itself is meant to take upon flesh and the word itself is meant to move to meet the need of the hour even so verse 17 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i will show thee my faith by my work thou believers that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see us thou have faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect brought to a completion and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness now notice a fulfillment of that scripture before the works could ever take place of the offering up before isaac could come and before isaac could even be offered up it all starts with faith works do not bring faith but it's faith that produces works so now faith is demonstrated according to the word so what is abraham what was abraham doing abraham was now acting out the word that had been revealed to him you see a life brother brandon would tell us in this way a life lived by the word is simply the word being expressed so he says this scripture was fulfilled so a fulfillment of scripture is not just belief but in now is action abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also so when we look at this of faith and i want to speak here this morning and we'll see how far we we come within this but i want to speak on this thought operating by the faith of the hour operating by the faith of the hour you recognize that real faith it that is sown into the ordained betting ground where that faith that word it has an intended target there's an in there is an intention when god would send a message there are hearts who are who are identified with that word and that word is sent to bring them to life and into expression to where that word is lived that is an ordained betting ground the the seed it's a it's a womb of god's own choosing and it will declare in action and word spoken expression according to the revealed will of god for the hour in other words this is a life that is completely in tune with the voice of god now when we look at this you see faith itself is a revelation and we'll be coming into some of these places it's a measure that god deals to every man severally as he will and that faith that god has sown in the heart that's that faith that god sows in the heart of the redeemed brother random makes this this this this statement here in spiritual food and due season and he says now we want you to get built up in the holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you've heard preached the signs and wonders you've seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether that be of god or not that simplicity of the accumulation it's like in many of us we keep little tokens and things of remembrance of you know perhaps that leading into the wedding day and the wedding and then as the children come along you you keep things that are very uh special and peculiar we keep memories uh picture and video and so forth of certain family events or other holidays or birthdays or on and on and we keep those things those things are that we keep are what is so precious to us it's just like sometimes where it comes maybe to thin out things in the house and you would say this right here no i i we we can't let go of this right here because you would have a special a special part to you maybe it's not even something that is useful but it's something that has a special meaning maybe it's something that you know a loved one had that is went on home to be with the lord but nonetheless it's something that you would have value and there is an accumulation things that you accumulate or what is of a value to you things that are not valued to you is things that you don't accumulate you don't care if it goes this way you don't care what happens to it now when the bible says regarding samuel when his words were spoke the bible says that the lord did not allow his words to fall to the ground now how it was not as though god had his hand out and catching the word but there was people and ordained people of god david being one of them who was a place that the word could fall into and that word falling there was the fulfillment of the scripture that god seen that his words did not fall to the ground and that's the same way in this hour there is an accumulation in the heart of the believer of what we've seen what we've heard and the word and the experiences in our life what god has done in our life and the word it's accumulating and what is it those events are supernatural events every request that is answered the word that has been revealed to us it is a supernatural event and it is accumulating in our hearts sometimes we understand there's a lot of unnecessary things that can be accumulated a lot of things can take place and be accumulated like we've seen you know over the course of this uh whole a virus this this part that's been among you seen people months ago you start seeing people even now under fear they begin to accumulate things so we understand that there are things that can be accumulated doubt unbelief fear worry complexes offenses a lot of things that we can accumulate but if we can step back and to evaluate that there is only one thing that's very important and should be the most important thing we should steam it above our necessary food and that is the revealed word of god the faith of this hour because it is that faith that guides and directs us through every part in our life it's not just something that is a part of well it's a part of church or it's a part of me coming to church no he is our life this is the faith like we mentioned on thursday this is the faith that has polycarp went to the stake this is the same faith operating in our lives to daily strive against sin and unbelief and the powers of darkness and to cast down reasoning and and so forth for every need that presents itself so brother branham would he would take us into this place and it would be an admonishing to our lives that jesus christ as he says it's like elijah of old said if god be god then serve him and if jesus is the center of all things to the christian then i think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him remember he is the center he is the north star he's the ultimate he's the absolute you so you see the things that we that perhaps have been accumulated or things that could be present yes how is there a turning loose of that it's to look to him that we want to ensure to cleave to him and examine everything else in our life to see where is he in all of this he's the saints to be the center the focus he's the north star and there's only one thing that'll point to the north star that's your compass you're selling with and the compass that i'm trying i'm trying for you to sell with is the word and the word always points to him so you see very clearly here in this statement this is not just the bible remember in israel they had the prophets the psalms and so forth but they did not have the word of the lord and even with having a have we'll say it like this having a bible without the word of the lord that saith the lord the voice of the holy spirit speaking you do not have the word of the lord because the word of the lord is the revealed will that's been sealed up in the written word so we feel like brother ramsay like this that we're going through a great time of distress and trials perplexity of the time distress between the nations all kinds of things happening sometimes i get engulfed everywhere i look it's like a ship out on the sea and i've been given charge of the boat amen hallelujah this this boat we're speaking of this is that finishing up of the body of jesus christ are you with me and how we gonna make it here comes one with a white cap hundred times bigger than my ship are you listening but we'll crest them every one [Applause] the ship's not turning around and going back to harbor we're going through we are more than victors through him the faith the chief captain has got a hold of the string on the end of the ship he'll pull it through we'll crest every one of them think of this statement here when it brings it down in simplicity it would it has the the perception we're looking at the the ground and and here the boat the body of jesus christ being baptized into jesus christ the word but to recognize there's a pull in that word it's a pull from the other side it's kind of like when you look at that little you know boat that you would have as a toy you would have a string you could pull it along you had power over that boat let me just say you in christ it is christ who has the power there is no wave there is nothing can hinder the ship from going to the other side we may have to stop and seek the mind of god in these times but we're not going back to harbor we're going forward by the faith of this hour so in luke 18 8 the lord jesus he says nevertheless when the son of man cometh in his return shall he find faith on the earth notice when the son of man you see it's it's a promise this is not just speaking of the corporal coming this is speaking because before of the corporal coming there's got to be a message that goes forth to make a people ready and he will take the revealing of the son of man the revealing of his coming so the question when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth think of brother branham would put this he said notice he didn't say well they find churches a lot of churches didn't say well they find christians a lot of christians but the question is shall i find faith on the earth so if he's looking for faith we want to make sure that we understand the faith that he's looking for because faith can be you know many times faith is just thrown around uh and i hate to say it this way but sometimes it's used in such a generic term as though we'll just have faith or just have faith just have faith and it's so empty so empty because for a person to even say just have faith you should have a life that backs up and expresses faith and when that happens you recognize it's not just something loosely that we're throwing out there faith the faith of this hour jude 1 verse 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend this is war this is war contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints this is satan's objective is to withstand this faith this is his objective because if he can keep the people from this faith they could come to church they could be you know christians because remember there's a big difference between a holy ghost field christian and just a christian there's a big difference and if satan can somehow keep people from this faith the faith notice this was not a faith that that they already had but it was the faith that was delivered by god himself to the church of the living god that same faith is the same faith that god delivered to abraham the same faith that god delivered to sarah because when god changed abraham's name to abraham he put his last name he put his name upon abraham his name his life his character it would be god by the power of his word he transformed abraham he changed abraham from laughing within to having a faith that staggered not at the promise of almighty god you see god removes all doubt from the inside this is the faith and to to operate as our title would indicate to operate is to be moved by the faith of this hour it cannot be a different faith it must be the original faith that was delivered to the church because there's no other faith many times we once again we hear this what faith are you of what faith are you of well i'm the methodist faith or i'm this faith i'm that no there's not multiple faiths there's one faith the bible says in ephesians 4 4 there's one body one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all through all and in you all i want you to look here in the scriptures in acts 3 16 here is peter this is after they've come out of the upper room and here he sees the man at the gate called beautiful the man is impotent he's laying there he's not able to walk he he's laying there begging and remember peter walks up to him and it's not this was not just peter taking it upon himself but as peter notice peter begins to see this but it's not just peter's eyes you know you and i could see a lot of needs a lot of needs that we would like to try to minister to or we will say like this would love to see god move upon that need and that's something that is a believer but this was not peter just simply taking the word and i'm going to take the word and i'm going to do away with this situation no he is in tune with god and as he looks upon the man there is a perceiving that's going on and when peter speaks to him and says silver and gold have a nun and and such as i have i give to you so what peter had there was able by god's sovereign grace to be released a virtue of faith in that moment that was needed for that man to stand up and walk from that place this is what peter says acts 3 16 and his name this is when he's asking them or when he's asked how did this happen how did this take place his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all you see brother brandon would pick this up and i want to refer to this he says you see he says it was jesus name and jesus faith brought about the miracle was not peter's faith it was the faith that comes by him peter did not claim it was his own human faith any more than he claimed it was his own name he said that jesus name used in the faith which is from jesus performed that great work and he says it was his faith speaking of the lord jesus it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the believers so who was it that healed that man it was the faith of the lord jesus operating through his body peter said this is not my faith that raised him up but it was the faith that is by him hath went forth you see what did it happen faith saw the need and faith responded to the need this is what james was writing about faith responds to the need you see in romans 12 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith god has dealt to every man the measure of faith remember who he's talking to verse 1 brethren brethren ephesians 2 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that faith and that faith is not of yourselves it is the gift of god you see even for a person to begin to believe it it takes the faith of god operating on their heart to even repent it takes the faith of god operating on their heart for their mind to be turned to holiness that would that then god moves down into the very depth and the power of transformation to where now that same faith that has been calling and dealing that same faith now comes on the inside and lives itself out james 2 1 my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of person notice brethren the faith of our lord jesus christ brother branham withdrawal the attention he says notice he didn't say have not the faith he didn't say he says have not the faith of not not in the faith of so this faith is dwelling in his body now as brother rana would would go through this here i want to read these parts very important in the permea in the pergamine age remember this is the age of the seed of satan this is a this is a time where it's leading up to the transition in the next stage into the red horse rider the first three ages are under that white horse rider he's trying to conquer notice how does he conquer through innocency flatteries he gets it to where everybody will just kind of relinquish their rights and just lay everything down and then when he gets it into that place then he unites together church and state and persecution comes on so in the pergamian age look how brother of them says this where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the lord having cast aside the doctrine of election and opened wide the church door and their fellowship to any and all who subscribed to their tenants never mind the word in this age of rapid degradation there were still the few who had the measure of that faith of our lord jesus christ and not only used that faith in acts of power but withstood those who dared to say they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church this is contending for that same faith that's the same faith that calls out and says it's not good enough just to know the message it's not good enough just to know that god has sent a prophet it's just not good enough you must be born again hell is filled with church members rich young ruler he spoke from there he was able to look across into paradise and see the rest in abraham's bosom abraham's bosom was the oncoming promise i will bring you into this land i will restore you i will bring you back home to where god's word would come in fulfillment and while they were waiting under the sacrificial blood of the natural lamb they were waiting there by revelation for that of the lamb to come whose blood whose life coming forth would release them from behold that were there in paradise look at this they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of god apart from the measure of the faith of the lord jesus himself as today's church is filled with mental believers now i wanted to say this mental believers intellectual brother branham brings that together that's emotional not just people who are when we look at well they don't believe in any emotion no brother baptize this together in in the messages of faith of their you can have these such people who become worked up he's and he ties it together with that intellectual faith why it's human faith once they get out they get out from under where the presence of god where they're at then everything they doubt the very things that they claim to have received you see what god comes to do is bring a transformation if your faith is only good enough for thursday and sunday for some folks it's only good for sunday because they don't believe in thursdays anyhow but i'm just saying like this if your faith is only good for once in a while you better hang it up and get the real faith of the lord jesus christ you better say god let lord jesus let that faith come into me that faith that operates through my life oh glory as today's church is filled with mental believers look at this who endorse the virgin birth the shed blood going to church taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in this third age there was the same problem human faith wasn't enough then and it's not enough now it takes the very faith of the son of god to drop look at this statement it takes the very faith of the son of god to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the lord of glory into the temple not made with hands what is that temple not made with hands that's that seed that lay in you that's that soul the brother said that's the real gift that come from god and the holy spirit the second adam the quickening spirit he comes to quicken that seed and that soul sets in you right there it's a new nature that sets in that's the temple remember his presence it covered it it was emanated out from the holiest of holies this is why when the new birth has come it emanates it's not under natural lights but it is the light the shekinah glory of god with word on the inside the manna is always kept fresh manna could fall in the camp but they had to go out every day and get new manner in one way that's a type that your experience with god must be fed there must be a renewal there must be refreshing but also at the same time it also spoke to show you and i that if the manna only comes to the flesh to the mind to the spirit and never comes down to the soul then that life can only last so long before wiggle tails will set in it because the intended place of his habitation that temple that is not made with hands you in that soul that you were you came here with that soul came according to that nature that was in you that earthly worldly sinful nature but there was a seed on the inside and god was dealing with and drawing that real you to come forward that's the place of his habitation simply put brother branham would say it and souls in prison now when he gets that old nature to agree with him he kills it and then he comes in fully because you see god ain't going to live with somebody else in the house he won't marry an adulteress hallelujah let me read that statement again human faith wasn't enough then it's not enough now it takes the very faith of the son of god to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the lord of glory into the temple not made with hands paul said in galatians 2 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live so there's a part that was crucified nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me this brethren says this was a living faith it's not dead it's not vain it's a living faith i live by the faith of the son of god paul did not say that he lived by faith in the son of god it was the faith of the son of god that had given him life and kept him living in christian victory how was abraham's body changed by the faith of elohim the strong one el shaddai coming into abraham what is it when we read romans 4 being not weak in faith it's because the faith of elohim came in him hallelujah how would he reproduce the faith of elohim by a surrendered life where god came in and would express how did sarah the bible says through faith she received strength to conceive how was that it was by the faith of elohim what was he doing he was producing his word that word that was spoken that thought that began to unfold of redemption now the faith for that word to be fulfilled or proven through their lives as believers the faith came glory that was necessary to meet the conditions of the hour so it is god god fulfilling his word it's his faith operating in us notice the faith of the son of god that had given him life and kept him living in christian victory this is why john went right by inspiration whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith there's an only you when this faith has come you can't lose victory because that is the victory even it says our faith but once he gives us his faith it now is our faith we lay all become one with that it's him no longer twain but one it is the faith of god pulsating through our lives just as when he said i will give her a seed brother said when he gave mary that seed it now was her seed god has delivered given out the measure he has imparted by grace his faith it is our faith it's victory that same faith it's a living reality a living person pulsating through our lives it's like that little that little fountain that was privileged to go see that little stream that brother branham spoke on and oh my there it is yet still so cool and refreshing we we took you know bottles of water and and drank out of that stream that was there clear cold it was bubbling up remember that's the one the brother says why do you do that and he asked many questions and brother branham dramatizing that to us bringing it to a real life as a believer a real life of a believer see god never intended you to wait on local revivals to happen god intended that your life would be a revival hallelujah this is the grace of god that is given to us what makes you do that it is a force that's behind me what force is that faith what causes faith to stand out it's love brother baby love pushes faith out onto the battlefront this is the victory that overcometh the world even if in your boat remember wood can be going down a stream it can float and get caught up here get caught up here but if that wood ever gets brought into that of a master builder one who builds the boat then that wood itself it now comes in to position it becomes a part of something then and then there becomes a power behind that boat there can be wood that is hung up all up and down the river but here is a boat made out of the same kind of wood and it's going down the river it sometimes it can run into places of snag traps and so forth but what's the difference it has a power behind it that once things arise there is a power behind it that it can able to get itself out of that what is that that is the faith of the lord jesus christ this is the victory that overcomes the world you see many things can arise things can come up sin can vary very slightly let me just say very clearly sometimes the way satan will come in i just this this is comes to me and i'm going to speak this right now sometimes satan can come in very slug slyly with medicines and drugs listen we believe in medicine but satan can come in so slightly to where then a person can become hooked on drugs they live their day based on drugs oh i hope somebody preaching with me you see how can come in so slightly in a way listen to me now it's not saying well i'm just going to throw them away that's not what we're saying we're saying to recognize that even when it can come to something like that and you recognize lord there's a trap that set in upon my life let me tell you something brother it's the same faith that dropped down that transformed your life it's that same faith that's there power that'll get you out of that mess don't stay tangled up in the weeds and the cares of life you can't beat yourself up over it either that won't do you no good because you've got to look at the power of the faith of jesus christ that's the victory glory i feel like running all over this building notice how the scripture would address this it talks of stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost full of faith and power that power that's due to myself the holy ghost full talks of silence being a man in acts 11 24 full of the holy ghost and a faith notice full you can't be full of faith and not fill with the holy ghost i'm talking about the faith of the lord jesus i'm talking about the measure of faith that he's given that did he notice it comes together because the faith that is of him is his life coming in to his body full of faith fool where that life that seed has received that water of life been quickened been raised up in an expression of elohim an expression of god faith itself this word that the writers would choose by inspiration to write here it's that conviction that's a that's a big word in itself the reason many times you see people just taking things so lightly and well this doesn't matter and that they'd have no conviction conviction has left the earth people have no conviction they can set and hear the word and they're as guilty as a fox in the hen house no conviction no reflection so they're not seeing the mirror of the word let me just tell you something for each and every one of us the word of god is to be a looking glass and that bible it's the bible speaks of it a looking glass that that has a man would look the bible says looketh in and you know how man what the scripture means there when it says look in it's one who lowers himself in order to see what is there it takes humility to the word for us to really see who we are to see the areas in the life that need to be changed conviction conviction conviction of the truth a conviction or a belief it's that holy fervor i love this that holy fervor born of faith and joined with it they were full of faith and of the holy ghost a person could have they could have the spirit of god brother iran would bring that out every moment of their life he's talking about that flesh that is there and not having a seed there on the inside a soul that come from god that see that that holy spirit can dwell around that life but it's got to come to the inside of the inside that transforms that life you see we're living in the hour where the plumb line is set forth so with this part this is why as god would set forth here let me just move a little bit this is why the ministry the ministry is set forth the fightful ministry is set for this is why that god in each of the seven gentile ages god would send a messenger it was at the end time in accordance with his word it's a junction of time it's a time where it's the it is the climax of all things what the church has to look forward to is the coming of the lord now as god had faithful men paul remember he was a prophet there that here ministered there prior to the beginning of that ephesian age and he stood there and we find that here that god what god had sent forth was that word this is what jude was writing about the things that you and i are privileged to understand and desire it's because god coming to fulfill his word a promise these are truths that were scattered laying in the scripture but they were scattered there are things that have laid here that were hidden that were laying in their nuggets for this hour for this season and god knows that you and i would have need of it they were tucked in there like hidden gems but now is the hour that we have need of that and it has meaning to our lives it has meaning to us it's not just a nice pretty lovely song ezekiel was a lovely song to israel this is not just a lovely song this is the inspiration on the holy ghost that has come down in this hour in the fullness of his word the fulfillment in the son of man now working and operating and energizing and inspiring the bride of jesus christ in the music sheet of the word of the lord so that the word is to be acted out in our lives this is why god would send the ministry the bible said till we all come in the unity of the faith i know sometimes we think that's got to be everybody's seeing eye to eye no no no no even me and you sat down long enough we'll disagree on something but the faith is that life that person being identified in him the challenge comes is can we allow allowed differences and then as the scripture goes on to say that we come in maturity to recognize we have differences but we have one focus and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man who's been bringing up this perfect man who's been the one raising up his body who was the one that's been raising the body that went in the ground in the dark ages there in that thy tyrant age who is it that began to raise it up there as a little shoot in the days of luther who was it that began to raise it up in a tassel in the days of wesley who is it that began to raise it up in the shock in the days there of the restoration of the gifts at azusa's tree who is it that now has come on the scene in the fullness of his word and revealing himself and bringing the bride body back the bright tree standing on her feet who is that bright tree it is the tree of life revealed in bright form who is it that has restored all these things who is it it's him bringing it back into the fullness of the measure this is the hour the marriage of the lamb has come remember to her was granted fine linen that she might be clothed in she did not did not provide her wedding garment she received the wedding garment of him who is her mate and that righteousness of the saints is not is not the works of man but that righteousness of the saints is the same holy ghost the same faith that comes from him it is that same working in the light the righteousness of the saints that fine linen the bride is a tired with the same garment of the sealing angel fine linen we're tired with that same one that elijah when he threw back the garment to elisha and to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ notice the working of the ministry bringing it up into the fullness you see this is the working of the faith of god in our lives to be able to be able to take that word to receive it not try to figure it out but to be able to stand there as a seat of abraham be it unto me according to thy word that's able to have the word to let the word grow mature us ripeness you see this is the fulfillment of the of the of the prophecy of the word where jesus when he spoke remember they asked him in matthew 17 this all ties together some new ones that are here among us this all ties together in malachi 4. you see the bible is not a loosely connected book it's a book of prophecy it ties together when jesus walked and the fulfillment there in luke 24 he took the scriptures that was pertaining to him that lay in all of these parts through the scripture and he brought them together that it might identify him who is the word he in the fulfillment of his word that's the same thing when we see this here in matthew 17. when they ask the question verse 10 why didn't say the scribes that elias elijah must first come and jesus answered and sent on them elijah truly shall first come known as future event and restore all things a ministry of restoration like elijah gathering those stones on the mountain let me finish this let me finish but i say unto you that elijah now notice he directs them to the fulfillment of that prophecy that was taking place even then elijah has come already which is speaking of john the baptist and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer there so it shows here is a fulfillment of scripture john's ministry it was a junction time ministry it was prophesied that that ministry would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children as it goes on to say in luke and he'll go before him in the power of elijah elijah and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children this was the this was the promised word of god so that it would turn the hearts of the children or the fathers to the children's message who were the children the children were the elect seed of abraham not the natural seed of abraham but the election of abraham the elect that would receive the word that's why paul can say in romans that as the word went forth and and and it did not it seemed ago it took no effect but yet the word had an effect upon those who it was sent for see god's not interested in big crowds god comes the word comes for redemption to bring back what belongs to him so this here in verse 11 we referred to the elijah elijah truly shall first come so that he he's announcing there is coming a restoration there has to be restoring or restoring a lie to the fullness of the word i only understand what i'm saying not just doctrine but it must be true doctrine but it cannot be just doctrine at home it takes it's the fullness of himself this is why the scripture speaks of the revealing of the son of man it's the fullness of christ himself manifested through the ministry of malachi 4. this is why brother damn says it's the word in the man that's how it was with the prophets of old the bible says in hebrews 1 1 that god who in sundried times spake unto our fathers in the prophets you see it's not just a word but it is god himself who is the word he is the character the nature the name is what is revealed to his children my sheep know my voice it's a word a message that god sends forth to restore the original bible faith what you think of this think of this because many walk around and say i believe the bible but do they really have the original bible faith remember what i talked about humanizing salvation humanize it and when it's humanized that here it is it's faith without germ it has no germ life in it to produce the life of the word you see in order for the word to be produced as we said with abraham and sarah it took god's own faith they had they became up one with it to where as we read in the scriptures a moment ago even our faith how are you living i'm living by the faith of the son of god not drifting not just loafing around i'm living by the faith of the son of god let me tell you what did the faith of the son of god do it led him to say i must be about my father's business original bible faith let me just try to narrow down on this very important i feel just to labor on this a moment many could claim well i believe the bible and yet denying the holy ghost the bible said they would in this last days they would have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof and that power that they deny is the power of the vindicated word listen to me it don't matter how much demonstration a person has if they deny the power of the vindicated word they are an enemy to god ham straightly told us in satan's eden he said if it's for the word that's your brother if it's against the word that's your enemy this is the faith that was once delivered to the saints original bible faith you see we're not just talking about a faith that says well you know i believe that god raised jesus from the dead that's good that's a start well you know i also believe you know that you need to be really sanctified by the blood there's a life that can come to begin to purge out that sets the mind in order for holiness to where things begin to oh wow yeah i shouldn't do this and oh my yeah i shouldn't do that and i shouldn't do that it begins to come set the mind in order that's good but there's more to it it must come to a place even a person can say well i don't know about the gifts i'm gonna preach a little bit even around our message where people don't believe in preachers they don't believe in gifts they don't believe in the supernatural everything's so bolded down and tied down i'm telling you that ain't original bible faith original bible faith is lives that believe all the word of god brother brown simply put it in the easter seal he said if you don't believe one word of god everything but one word you're an unbeliever that's unbelief it's to believe all of the word this is why this this is what the purpose of the message that god sent to us where the church had drifted it came to unite us with the original faith the same faith we read about in acts 3 16 the same faith in romans 12 3 the same faith in ephesians 2 8 the same faith in james it's the same faith what faith is it it's the faith of our lord jesus christ it's his person in its fullness working through his bride body this is what the seals were all about reveal where satan had come against that faith tried to trample it out but god reserved unto himself in the opening of that seventh seal it would be a coming of the holy ghost the coming of the word brother graham called it the bride coming it would be a coming of the son of man to manifest himself in a bright body why it's time for marriage it's marriage the union that which was taken from his side that which went in the ground has come back in the full maturity the full power his life see to original bible faith with things it's not just parts of the word let me just say it god never asked me to make it live god never asked you to make it live the violin is laying right there the word laying right there the word here the music sheet the word laying in our life who did it take it took the master himself taken the rosin and moving upon the bow strings took the holy spirit and it began to move upon those strings of predestination and he began to take our life into his hand and there's certain notes that were necessary to be played and his his hands placed there and as he would begin to take that violin he would bring out of that violin the music that was trapped in it only his hands upon that violin could cause the arrangements of the notes to come forth like they ought to come forth only his faith in our life causes the notes to come forth as they ought to original bible faith to believe all that he was he poured into christ all that christ was he had poured into his church see brother brown would make it simple he would sim make it simple because every one of us the scriptures we read here in ephesians 4 there's diversity among the body even the gifts even ministerial gifts from even pastors every not every pastor is alike god doesn't want us to be alike well i think we should do something like brother so-and-so i don't want to be like so-and-so and i don't want so-and-so to be like me god made me who i am for a purpose and a reason brother brahm said it put it simply it's for a certain people see we're all different this is why brother brown would make a statement and say it like this he said some he said they got faith like enoch he said if i don't have that faith or he said faith like that i'm not going to stand in the way of somebody else who does you understand what i'm saying sometimes you get i'm i'm afraid that sometimes it's got to a place to where everything's got everything is like well it's got to be such so deep and it's got to be the mysteries were not meant to be or your head's swirling in a service like whoa what's that all about i don't know but it was deep no no no no no no it's to be a faith that comes down into your life it takes god the same one who walked on the road to emmaus it was him him he gave life to that word he broke the bread as he was breaking the word then their eyes become open this is him this is him as he breaks the word as we're gathered here you're gathered in your homes and he's stepping out right here of the pages he steps out of the shadows he steps out of quotes you've been meditating on scriptures that you're meditating on from your devotion and he steps out and he gathers those and he begins to speak and break the bread it's adversity this is why this is why god and i thank god i think god that he has ministries that are so sacked for faith oh brother samuel brothers so and so you know they really don't get into this and get into that let me just tell you something the third pull is not a phrase it is the person of jesus christ operating in the bride body if it's no more than doctrine satan's got you but it's an operation in the body of jesus christ oh it comes back to original bible faith original bible thing let me just close we're closed there this is why god would send his word you know when god when he speaks here in romans 10 just closed and speaks of faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of god see faith can only come by the word when i come by the word and that word paul as you trace back before those scriptures in that same place it must be those that preach they are sent by god so what is it that they are ministering by and of the faith of god do you realize that even as you said at your home those few of us that are sitting right here and have been right here you recognize in this age when god would sinned malachi 4. and that same word is still being proclaimed not another message it's the same message that's being preached that must prophesy again i want you to understand where abraham was at in genesis 17 when god god let him know that abraham this is the covenant that i will make with thee and thy seed that shall circumcise every man born every man child born in your house and even those servants eliza remember was a servant you see what that was speaking of that was even speaking of because god would talk about even in the the offerings in the old testament that a stranger who were the strangers me and you the gentiles as they were sealed in their flesh as a sign that the faith had been accepted so are we sealed circumcised with that circumcision that is without hands god's faith and here god is speaking this notice this hasn't taken place yet he speaks it in genesis 17. abraham hears that and then god unfolds to him and you shall not call your wife sarai but thou shalt call her sarah for i will give thee a son by her and him will i make my covenant with remember the scripture says abraham laughed in his heart how how is this going to be you see what god had to take care of the laughter would stop when he took care of this down here how's he going to take care of this god is letting it be known in that chapter the word elohim his breath his word his inspiration is coming out over abraham's life it's time for that word that word is going to have an effect who was it that dissolved the laughter in abraham's heart who was it that dissolved the laughter in sarah's heart notice the angel referred to him he came down and took upon a body of flesh and he delivered that message to them he did not call him abram he called him by the revelation abraham his priestly name he let him know it's time for the faith my faith to be reproduced abraham your faith is not enough for this promise sarah you slightly doubted it not all the way you slightly doubt it but slight doubt is not enough it takes my faith so what does he come and do he takes his word his promise and he breathes over their life brother brown said how did god change sarah he said he breathed over her life what was it on the on the day of pentecost it was the breath of god in luke 24 jesus gathered them in there and he breathed upon them and said receive ye the holy ghost what is the holy ghost it is the word of god in power and demonstration it's the gospel that is breathed over the life and let's say all that under inspiration to say this he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still speaking the spirit of truth is right here with us his word is still proclaimed his word is still casting out doubt and unbelief laughter that could be there how could this be me or how could that be me his word comes to dissolve that i want you to understand very clearly his word it is the only thing that can separate you from you to where it comes to identify who the real you really is on the inside and he brings that life forward and here we are standing here oh sure there could be a lot of thoughts go through your mind but when the faith of elohim the faith of the lord jesus christ is there in that heart let me just tell you that's an anchor that holds beyond the veil no matter what comes it's the victory that overcomes the world even in times thoughts can come to your mind sickness come to your body things can be upset along the way but it's the faith that overcomes the world why you can't sink the faith of god this is why human faith is not good enough it requires the faith that is of him and that's what the message of the hour it come to do bring us back to the original bible faith to re store to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers faith is not just a belief many times we think of that faith well oh this is my faith no no i think we've established that the holy spirit is so established no no no no no we're talking about the faith of god that belief that comes from god that which is of him and i said this morning as musicians would come will paul if you'll come i say it like this if if all that you've known is human faith maybe you've subscribed to the tenants if i can use that that same word the brother bram used maybe you subscribed to the doctrine of the message you subscribed to the tenants of the message you subscribed to the church but the question is do you really have that living faith on the inside where it's not you it's not you it's not it's not you trying to do it but it's a love affair from the depths from within where it's god operating his word where you hear his voice i'm say i say this and i encourage you cast down that spirit of pride listen you don't know how long i i'd be so ashamed for years i've said here that's a spirit of pride that's trying to hinder you cast that down that devil's trying to hinder you from a promise that belongs to you my sister he's trying to hinder you from a promise brother it belongs to you if you just say lord come into me fully let that faith of the son of god let it drop that the lord of glory might be received into this tabernacle not made with him just the simplicity god is moved by the simplicity of the confession of your heart if there's anything that would be in the way let it be cleared out make it right and i say for each and every one of us for for all of us because this is not just for someone who has not fully moved into that but i would encourage every one of us this this brings stability in this time it speaks to us in our life this is what we need to be accumulating there should be a building up this is what ephesians 4 spoke of it's building up until we come to the fullness of the measure it's accumulating it ought to be a hungering within our life [Music] just saying i feel like i've i've gotten a little weak then take the admonition of the holy spirit let the things that god is saying even how god is speaking to your life in these services be in fellowship with him even the things the little details that he's shown his love his care for you [Music] i feel like i'm getting a little weak then i then i look to god and ask god say lord lord let i want an evaluating are there things i've allowed to accumulate in my life that's weakening that faith you see to accumulate sometimes to accumulate you've got to go and value because sometimes you know wife or husband or somebody could say hey no more no more here we don't have no more room and this is where an evaluation comes in our life is the holy spirit saying i don't have any more room and it isn't because he's just got everything covered it's because sometimes we have allowed other things to accumulate this is where the scripture says [Music] in the book of jude building up yourselves on your most holy faith what holy faith his faith so how do we build ourselves up what's he talking about to building ourselves up it is the accumulating accumulating the goodness of god accumulating the mercy of god accumulating the word of god i say holy spirit o lamb of god have your way lord move through this body move in every home lord move in every life lord god i pray right now lord any heart lord that dear god to this moment it's been lord of human faith and as your prophet with the lord admonishes he said don't throw that away but let it become a real living supernatural faith oh god i asked lord jesus that in this moment that every spirit of pride cast down lord god like the philistines that would raise up their head lord in mockery satan we rebuke you in the name of jesus christ this is that faith that was once delivered to the saints original bible faith the same holy ghost in his fullness full power full strength full life same nature granted lord i pray right now in the name of jesus christ in the humility of the word lord as hearts are prostrated before you lives o god i pray that lord the prayer from their heart would be lord i fully surrender now lord will you fully come in granted lord i pray for every need every heart every life that's gathered here i pray god that for lives that lord maybe there's been things that's accumulated things that lord that it's got them hung up like that boat they've got the power the engine there behind that boat but things lord have got them ensnared maybe it's not even things of the lord that is looked at as sinful it's just simply the cares of life this is where lord paul would admonish us that they that use the world do not abuse it use what's what's necessary but don't become absorbed granted lord i pray in the name of jesus christ lord you're the revealer of the word you're the one lord to not only expose and help us that we might see but oh god may that be the value lord if a person right now lord there could be things brought to the attention and there could be things lord that they could try to say well what about this or what about that but god let it be they're focusing on the north star and of you being the center of that life then lord if there's anything that's hindering them from walking according to that north star in liberty then dear god the light of the word will reveal it may they walk lord in the light as you're in the light father granite we pray may you watch over your children strengthen glory granted in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] it's sheltering on oh i'm living
