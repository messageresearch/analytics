[43:07] so appreciative of the mercy of God I
[43:10] tell you what a what a wonderful time
[43:12] we're living in I really mean it just
[43:14] the word of the Lord just continues to
[43:16] become more and more real more more
[43:21] simple more simpler I just love how it
[43:23] just God just continues to condon send
[43:26] and make himself known to us and we just
[43:28] thank God for that
[43:29] good to see each and every one of you I
[43:31] know we have some visitors and maybe I'm
[43:34] overlooking of where they're at but god
[43:37] bless you it's good to see you
[43:40] with the brother/sister keener god bless
[43:43] you have a baptism today brother Jose

[43:53] thank God for that I'm also gonna ask
[43:56] that you just remember me in prayer that
[43:58] goes right now I've been scheduled to be
[44:02] down in some meetings in Blacksburg
[44:04] Virginia since back in January but I
[44:08] just need I need a touch from the Lord
[44:10] just a that I need a touch from God with
[44:13] the Lord just to give me strength if
[44:15] that's to do that
[44:17] in the meantime brother Boaz Romero live
[44:19] he will be here next next Sunday so I'll
[44:22] be here Lord willing with we'll be here
[44:24] together on Thursday but sometimes I
[44:25] don't see something you want Thursday
[44:27] and so I just kind of want to let you
[44:30] know that just if you would just keep
[44:32] that in prayer that the Lord will be
[44:33] mindful or is a number of Ministers
[44:36] there will be where brother Shawn Martin

[44:41] be there together so I think that's
[44:46] about it
[44:50] it's good to be here well let's let's
[44:53] look into the word this morning if we
[44:55] could let's open the Colossians chapter
[44:57] 1 and just see how the Lord will just
[45:00] guide us here you just pray for me this
[45:09] morning I'll try to preach boy it sounds
[45:16] like I'm complaining doing it I'm asking
[45:19] for your help this morning Colossians
[45:22] chapter 1 verse 12 we'll read just a few
[45:27] verses of Scripture then we'll just ask
[45:30] the blog Lord's blessing verse 12 in
[45:32] Colossians 1 giving thanks unto the
[45:35] Father which hath made us meet and that
[45:40] word meet there has made us able to be
[45:45] partakers of the inheritance of the
[45:48] Saints in light so we were ordained to
[45:52] this but we needed him to bring us to
[45:57] our inheritance who hath delivered us
[46:03] from the power of darkness and hath
[46:05] translated us into the kingdom of his
[46:09] dear son in whom we have redemption
[46:13] through his blood even the forgiveness
[46:16] of sins who is the image of the
[46:21] invisible God the firstborn of every
[46:24] creature for by him we're all things
[46:27] created that are in heaven and that are
[46:31] in earth visible and invisible whether
[46:34] they be Thrones or dominions or
[46:37] principalities or powers all things were
[46:42] created by him and for him and he is
[46:45] before all things and by him all things
[46:49] consist
[46:50] let's just bow our heads for a few
[46:52] moments Heavenly Father
[46:56] Lord you see Lord God here this morning
[46:59] as we have Lord come together Lord with
[47:02] one purpose on mind Lord your God we
[47:05] want to draw closer to you so we ask
[47:09] that Lord knowing that as you have given
[47:12] to us in your word it says draw nigh
[47:16] unto God and He will draw nigh unto you
[47:20] and father we realize that that's just
[47:23] simply even the turning of our thoughts
[47:26] and where Lord even in our thoughts and
[47:29] our hearts we welcome you Lord then
[47:33] father you're able to move down Lord
[47:35] through those channels and speak to us
[47:38] and draw us closer to you you're able to
[47:42] remove Lord and dissolve anything that
[47:45] would be a hindrance Lord you're able to
[47:48] so speak and move upon our lives to give
[47:50] us the authority that already lays
[47:53] within us but you are able to make it
[47:56] known to us Lord to be able to rise
[47:59] above Lord everything I pray that you'll
[48:03] help us this morning may you come and
[48:05] take me as a speaker Lord and take your
[48:07] your people Lord take us together Lord
[48:11] may you just be glorified and our midst
[48:13] and in our lives Lord and just speak
[48:16] your word to our hearts we pray in the
[48:18] name of Jesus Christ amen
[48:20] god bless you may be seated if you don't
[48:24] mind if you keep your Bibles open there
[48:26] or follow along with me I want to I want
[48:33] to speak on a thought here has just been
[48:37] a very prevailing fought over for quite
[48:40] a long time but on reconciliation but I
[48:44] want to just deal with it in the in the
[48:47] thought line this morning on stages of
[48:51] reconciliation with a real direction on
[48:54] the cost of it you know this is a time
[48:59] that we're living in in this world where
[49:02] there's a lot of things that are being
[49:04] brought together and you
[49:06] there's a lot of things that are moving
[49:10] together even very quickly and yet
[49:14] within it all when we look at what with
[49:17] reconciling there is a there's a great
[49:21] there's a cost that must be met in order
[49:24] to reconcile many times when you you
[49:28] look at one of the top reasons why that
[49:31] there are just lower these the monitors
[49:33] just a tad Bend just a tad because I do
[49:36] need them just attend one of the main
[49:40] causes and one of the things that we
[49:42] find that even when marriages themselves
[49:45] are dissolved they they term that there
[49:48] are irreconcilable differences that
[49:52] means things that they cannot come
[49:55] together on so we recognize that within
[50:00] that and when we think of that within
[50:02] marriage just in the natural there is
[50:06] definitely differences and we see those
[50:09] differences as a matter of fact we see
[50:11] faults and mistakes everything else and
[50:15] within that it really truly takes the
[50:18] grace of God and to be able to move
[50:22] those parts together to where that
[50:25] differences themselves to where it
[50:27] becomes reconcilable because if it's not
[50:30] reconciled then the difference continues
[50:34] to remain there and it remains to be a
[50:37] point of contention a point that doesn't
[50:41] allow a further uniting and so there's
[50:47] stages to all of that there first of all
[50:49] has to be an acknowledgment of the wrong
[50:52] that's done there's got to be not just
[50:56] an acknowledgement of it but coming from
[50:58] from deep within to allow those things
[51:01] to move and then allow the healing and
[51:04] to allow things for reconciliation to
[51:06] come I'm not gonna deal so much with all
[51:09] marriages today I what I'm dealing with
[51:10] is this and I trust that the Lord will
[51:12] help us to be able to see that how that
[51:15] these things it moves in every facet in
[51:19] every part of
[51:20] life of how that this is applied in
[51:23] everything because I believe this with
[51:25] all my self I believe it with all my
[51:26] heart I always have believed it this way
[51:28] it's where I'm minister it I don't
[51:30] believe let me just give an example I
[51:32] don't believe that the seals are just
[51:33] doctrine if it's just stays as doctrine
[51:37] Satan can run haywire but it's got to
[51:40] come to where that word that comes forth
[51:43] it must come to a discernment and
[51:46] application in our lives to be able to
[51:49] expose sin that's the real Ministry of
[51:54] the word that it gets down into our
[51:57] lives because if as far as doctrines and
[52:01] mysteries look we all enjoy that but
[52:03] it's good God's desire was that these
[52:05] things would become an application in
[52:08] our life not something that we just
[52:11] fellowship about but through the
[52:14] application we actually are coming in
[52:17] under the blood into fellowship of the
[52:21] mystery itself which is Christ so that's
[52:25] that's that's the whole there's an
[52:27] objective there's a purpose here so when
[52:30] we look at this let's just move on into
[52:32] the word here and just allow the Lord
[52:34] just to speak to us in verse 18
[52:37] continuing on it says he is the head of
[52:39] the body the church who is the beginning
[52:43] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[52:48] things he might have the preeminence so
[52:55] his desire to have the preeminence he
[52:58] himself took it upon himself to bring
[53:03] this about to where he might have the
[53:07] preeminence for it pleased the father
[53:11] that in him should all fullness dwell
[53:17] you think of this at how that God God
[53:20] created himself a body to come down and
[53:24] dwell in Jesus was not the second person
[53:31] because you you're not redeemed in order
[53:35] to be redeemed it's very simple if you
[53:37] have your watch that's in a pawn shop
[53:39] that belongs to you and you have to go
[53:43] to the pawn shop and get the watch out
[53:46] you are redeeming what belongs to you so
[53:51] that is exactly with God it was God
[53:54] coming down creating a body a tabernacle
[53:58] that he purposed to reveal himself with
[54:04] the whole purpose in order to die that
[54:10] he might redeem you and I so there's a
[54:13] purpose within it when you think of it
[54:15] here the Lord Jesus in the very we could
[54:20] say peak of his life he's thirty three
[54:22] and a half years old he doesn't die of
[54:25] old age but here he is as the Lamb of
[54:29] God here God comes down and takes upon
[54:34] this body this tabernacle that he's
[54:37] created for this purpose to where Paul
[54:40] would pick it up and he says when he
[54:42] bringeth the Sun into the world he said
[54:46] lo a body hast thou prepared for me and
[54:49] we know that the son coming into the
[54:52] world this is the word this is God
[54:55] condescending from the supernatural from
[54:59] that of invisible God coming into the
[55:01] supernatural the image of the word and
[55:04] then from the word here coming and
[55:08] coming down and the word becoming flesh
[55:10] it's God condescending
[55:14] the whole time to be come from word to
[55:18] flesh so all of it is God condescending
[55:22] and this is a part I want you to catch
[55:24] this now and maybe let me just drop this
[55:26] with you reconciliation requires
[55:30] condescension so in order to count in
[55:35] sin and what you think of this in order
[55:38] to come dance it we can look at this and
[55:41] we can see God came down
[55:44] came down and he created a tabernacle to
[55:48] dwell in I want you to think of this
[55:50] this body that God created and came and
[55:54] lived in how unfitting in in in one
[55:58] aspect of it because here God had to
[56:02] create a body that would come through
[56:05] and by the woman because of the fall and
[56:07] in that body here is age the age the
[56:12] wrinkled memory when they looked at him
[56:13] and he said before Abraham was I am and
[56:16] they said you're not a man more than 50
[56:19] years old you think you look older I
[56:22] look old differently the burden it was
[56:25] so age him to wear but in this God here
[56:29] created a tabernacle that he could come
[56:32] in and dwell among you and I in order to
[56:36] redeem us but it's we need to look
[56:38] deeper and we need to look further back
[56:41] than just the expression here in this
[56:44] tabernacle and this condescension we
[56:47] need to recognize that that
[56:49] condescension first began in the very
[56:53] mind of God it was not something that
[56:57] just came here in time humility already
[57:02] was there in God God had already laid it
[57:05] out that I I'm gonna come down and
[57:09] redeem and bring my children back to
[57:13] myself it was all part of his plan but
[57:16] this condescension it all starts with
[57:18] humility it's the same way in our lives
[57:22] it's not just a happening
[57:24] it starts inwardly the Bible says in
[57:32] first Timothy 3:16 without controversy
[57:36] great is the mystery of godliness God
[57:42] was manifest in the flesh Jesus Christ
[57:48] is God
[57:51] God was manifest in the flesh not a
[57:54] portion the very fullness he was
[58:00] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[58:04] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[58:08] in the world and received up into glory
[58:13] so when we look at this at this
[58:15] Scripture that weird well it on for it
[58:18] please the father that in him should all
[58:21] the fullness dwell we recognize that
[58:25] coming here to the River Jordan and how
[58:27] that here is the Lamb of God here is
[58:31] this tabernacle
[58:33] here's the temple there's the son of God
[58:36] and here he is coming to the River
[58:37] Jordan and we see how that God has
[58:40] everything is lining up where God has a
[58:44] messenger on earth that's identifying
[58:46] the time and he's calling the people to
[58:50] repentance he's pointing them he's
[58:52] preparing the way and then here steps
[58:55] forward the tabernacle the dwelling
[58:59] place where God is going to take his
[59:01] abode in order to redeem then through
[59:04] this we find very a very important part
[59:08] that this reconciling in order to
[59:11] reconcile it's to bring together like
[59:16] nature's reconciliation cannot take
[59:20] place without like nature's so there
[59:24] must be like nature's now the Spirit of
[59:28] God would move upon the prophets it
[59:32] wouldn't the Spirit of God would move
[59:34] upon the elect of God down through time
[59:38] who were looking for the lamb to come or
[59:41] what had been revealed to them but they
[59:44] never had experienced redemption in the
[59:50] reality of where that God himself would
[59:54] take up residency in their life and
[59:58] fully quicken the seed
[1:00:01] that couldn't be done the Spirit of God
[1:00:04] would move upon him then it would pull
[1:00:07] back but here at the River Jordan as he
[1:00:10] said on whom thou see the Spirit descend
[1:00:14] and remain the same is he so when we
[1:00:23] look at this in must be like nature's
[1:00:25] the Dove would have never let down on a
[1:00:28] wolf is that right these are very this
[1:00:30] some familiar terminology to you the
[1:00:33] Dove would have never let down on a wolf
[1:00:35] so it had to be like nature's come
[1:00:40] together now here the only one that
[1:00:44] could do that here God steps forward and
[1:00:46] God is reconciling himself with man as
[1:00:51] he takes his body he takes the very son
[1:00:56] he takes him to himself and here God
[1:00:59] steps into that vessel and God himself
[1:01:03] that's is why that in itself is the
[1:01:06] greatest event to take place because if
[1:01:09] that had not taken taken place then we
[1:01:12] would have never we would not have been
[1:01:14] redeemed so in order for us to be
[1:01:17] redeemed first of all like natures this
[1:01:20] had to be reconciled God had to
[1:01:22] reconcile with man God had to become one
[1:01:25] of us so it's a stage here showing that
[1:01:30] only like natures and that this is a
[1:01:33] parallel this is a parallel and we don't
[1:01:35] want to just leave it in a spiritual
[1:01:37] level here we see it on the day of
[1:01:39] Pentecost when they went up there to the
[1:01:41] upper room the word I want you just to
[1:01:45] catch this the word when Christ Himself
[1:01:48] when the Lord Jesus rose from the grave
[1:01:51] he began to assemble and he came and
[1:01:55] appeared to his disciples the Bible says
[1:01:59] apostles who were chosen and had began
[1:02:03] to make himself known to them after
[1:02:05] million many infallible proofs and
[1:02:08] instructing them on things concerning
[1:02:10] the kingdom of God for forty days now I
[1:02:12] want you to watch the effect of this
[1:02:14] word the
[1:02:15] effect of the word here going forth we
[1:02:18] see it moves to a place to where we then
[1:02:22] have a hundred and twenty vessels that
[1:02:26] now are going to the upper room and the
[1:02:29] Bible declares to us that they were of
[1:02:32] one mind at a one accord so the word
[1:02:38] itself coming forth after the blood has
[1:02:42] been shed is a word that is setting the
[1:02:46] people in order for full reconciliation
[1:02:52] so just the recognition of the word was
[1:02:56] not reconciliation yet it is a stage of
[1:03:00] it to recognize that he raised from the
[1:03:04] grave hope this is him that was not full
[1:03:07] reconciliation but it was a necessary
[1:03:10] stage so there's stages of
[1:03:16] reconciliation there's a parallel to all
[1:03:21] of this it's the same way when it comes
[1:03:25] to our homes it must be like nature's
[1:03:30] was getting quiet in here now said but
[1:03:37] saying it's easier to part the Red Sea
[1:03:40] but this is what I want you to see God
[1:03:43] has so put us together even though we're
[1:03:48] different as far as in our makeup and
[1:03:51] how God would bring together a husband
[1:03:54] and a wife but how do you say well blow
[1:03:57] seven when this a situation has come up
[1:03:59] or this thing how does it come to a
[1:04:01] place of light natures it comes to back
[1:04:04] to the resolve of the right purpose
[1:04:09] what's the purpose where's the where's
[1:04:14] the unifying tie because there's all
[1:04:16] there's many things that can come that
[1:04:19] can try to dissolve even that union but
[1:04:22] see everything has to work it has to be
[1:04:25] it has to work now you can look at like
[1:04:27] this and say I need God
[1:04:29] to make my wife to where she's a little
[1:04:30] bit more tender wonder who he's gonna
[1:04:36] use I need God to work on my husband he
[1:04:42] needs to become a little bit more
[1:04:43] lamb-like wonder who God's gonna use see
[1:04:53] when we're looking at this in part of
[1:04:58] reconciliation it all starts with
[1:05:00] there's a need there's a need then it
[1:05:05] moves as we said before before
[1:05:07] condescension that we see condensation
[1:05:11] that we see has to have already started
[1:05:14] within where the person was condom
[1:05:17] sending within who that's that's the
[1:05:22] real that's the real real reality it's
[1:05:26] condescension within then it manifest
[1:05:30] without is that true with the word we
[1:05:36] first have to humble ourselves and
[1:05:38] condon send within to the word then it's
[1:05:42] manifest without the the woman the
[1:05:46] syrophoenician woman look remember what
[1:05:48] the Lord Jesus said I'm not even sent to
[1:05:52] your dogs but what did she do she conned
[1:05:56] and send it
[1:05:57] how did she conned in sin whence what
[1:05:59] she spoke out she this is where she was
[1:06:01] at in her heart she placed herself lower
[1:06:05] and she received she received in what we
[1:06:11] see is oh how she condescended she
[1:06:14] placed herself down but where did that
[1:06:16] begin inwardly
[1:06:19] she was in his presence and inwardly she
[1:06:22] condescended sometimes you may not see
[1:06:27] the results that you want to see
[1:06:30] sometimes we want to take our hands and
[1:06:32] try to do this but listen all of this
[1:06:34] out here is not is not where things
[1:06:37] happen it happens to where we see things
[1:06:40] but the
[1:06:41] reality is it must start here and then
[1:06:44] come out here has I start in here so
[1:06:50] here let's look at these stages here in
[1:06:53] second Corinthians 5:18 I'm just gonna
[1:06:56] move just real quickly over to this in
[1:06:57] 2nd Corinthians 5:18 it says and all
[1:07:00] things are of God who hath reconciled us
[1:07:06] to himself by Jesus Christ so all things
[1:07:13] are of God this is this is God's doing
[1:07:17] this is not your doing or my doing this
[1:07:21] is God's doing well you know I wanted to
[1:07:25] be I wanted to be saved and that's why
[1:07:27] Jesus Christ came the reason that you
[1:07:31] had a desire is because that was already
[1:07:35] in you God already placed that there in
[1:07:40] you and God stirs up that desire of
[1:07:44] which is a first and that thirst can try
[1:07:48] to be satisfied by many other things and
[1:07:52] yet leaving a person empty because
[1:07:58] there's only one thing that can truly
[1:07:59] quench that thirst and that desire that
[1:08:04] is within that God is placed there and
[1:08:07] that is God himself
[1:08:12] hallelujah so all things are of God who
[1:08:16] hath not what should watch this who hath
[1:08:19] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:08:23] and hath given to us the Ministry of
[1:08:27] reconciliation now here here's here's
[1:08:31] this Ministry of reconciliation I'm not
[1:08:33] going to deal too much on that this
[1:08:34] morning to wit to wit that God was in
[1:08:38] Christ so in order for there a Ministry
[1:08:41] of reconciliation
[1:08:43] remember it's being reconciled to God so
[1:08:46] it must be God in the ministry
[1:08:49] reconciling his people unto himself
[1:08:54] is that right so it wasn't God
[1:08:57] reconciling people to Paul they weren't
[1:08:59] being reconciled to Cephas they weren't
[1:09:01] being reckoned reconciled to Apollo's
[1:09:03] but they were agents his Amen they were
[1:09:07] agents of God as Paul could say we are
[1:09:11] ambassadors be reconciled to God as we
[1:09:17] stand in Christ's stead so you could
[1:09:26] have someone who just loved Paul and
[1:09:28] they missed it it's not to be reconciled
[1:09:31] to Paul but through the ministry that is
[1:09:34] given that's revealed the real
[1:09:36] revelation breaking is where there comes
[1:09:39] a union between the vessel the
[1:09:43] individual and Christ
[1:09:45] oh my to wit that God was in Christ
[1:09:53] reconciling the world unto himself here
[1:09:57] was this like nature's coming together
[1:09:59] he was reconciling the world unto
[1:10:01] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:10:04] unto them I ask you a question in this
[1:10:11] country let's just look in this country
[1:10:13] do they come out and do they come out
[1:10:15] and get you and just say you're guilty
[1:10:18] of this crime in your going to prison
[1:10:20] for the rest of your life they don't do
[1:10:22] that there first of all there is an
[1:10:26] indicted there's an indicted and you
[1:10:29] wait you know in a holding cell or how
[1:10:32] you're out on bond or whatever more
[1:10:33] until there's a trial that comes about
[1:10:37] God answer if anybody think of this the
[1:10:41] Bible says that the law itself entered
[1:10:45] entered that sin might be exposed that
[1:10:51] was the purpose so where God could say
[1:10:54] this is guilty gone and pointed that out
[1:10:57] but notice when God came down
[1:11:00] reconciling the world unto himself he
[1:11:02] was not imputing their trespasses in
[1:11:05] them because here
[1:11:07] time where the payment is going to be
[1:11:09] made the actual time of judgment will
[1:11:13] come at the white throne judgment for
[1:11:15] those who neglected the Lord that will
[1:11:20] come because there has been a a price
[1:11:23] that's been paid for an individual for
[1:11:26] each and every one that you don't have
[1:11:28] to remain in that condition you can go
[1:11:32] free it's already the debt has already
[1:11:35] been paid so God and Christ were
[1:11:42] reconciled here together the Bible says
[1:11:45] in verse 21 of 2nd Corinthians 5 for he
[1:11:49] hath made him to be sin for us he made
[1:11:56] him to be there was a transfer of our
[1:11:59] sin upon him he was not only the light
[1:12:07] the the scapegoat he was the life goat
[1:12:10] he was that where our sins were placed
[1:12:13] upon him he was not sinful the Bible
[1:12:15] said he who knew no sin but it was
[1:12:20] transferred upon him hallelujah that we
[1:12:26] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:12:29] in him now as it moved back in here to
[1:12:33] colossians chapter 1 i'm trying to get
[1:12:35] somewhere here i want you to just follow
[1:12:38] me with this here and having made peace
[1:12:41] through the blood of his cross by him to
[1:12:48] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[1:12:52] i say whether they be things in earth or
[1:12:55] things in heaven when he was offered up
[1:13:01] and the blood touched the ground there
[1:13:04] and he descended down into the lower
[1:13:08] parts of the earth he reconciled those
[1:13:12] who were waiting in paradise they had
[1:13:17] been they had they had come to a
[1:13:20] place where they were resting in the
[1:13:23] bosom of Abraham the promise awaiting
[1:13:27] the coming Sun awaiting the the promised
[1:13:30] land and here they were waiting and what
[1:13:33] does he come to do he comes to minister
[1:13:37] the word of reconciliation that my blood
[1:13:41] has been shed the price has been paid
[1:13:46] and then he makes this known to the
[1:13:51] disciples to those as he's with them
[1:13:54] appearing to them bringing their
[1:13:56] confidence within the word that they
[1:13:59] then themselves might walk in and be
[1:14:03] fully reconciled they were not
[1:14:07] reconciled just walking with him hope
[1:14:11] you're with me it's not enough just to
[1:14:15] walk around where he's at that's not
[1:14:18] reconciliation reconciliation is for him
[1:14:23] to bring you in him there's a stages of
[1:14:31] reconciliation it's God declaring his
[1:14:34] mind notice this here he couldn't die as
[1:14:40] God he couldn't die as God he had to
[1:14:45] become a man a spirit can't bleed spirit
[1:14:52] can't die but he had Almighty God God
[1:14:57] had to condon sin and take up on a robe
[1:15:01] of flesh and step in that there had to
[1:15:05] first of all and how did he do that he
[1:15:07] did it by his word little by little
[1:15:10] there were portions of word that were
[1:15:12] laid out all the way from the Garden of
[1:15:15] Eden and here himself bringing all the
[1:15:18] word together and he moves in steps
[1:15:21] right into that word he reconciled all
[1:15:25] the portions all the promises all the
[1:15:30] scriptures
[1:15:31] all the prophecies here a were
[1:15:33] reconciled right there concerning the
[1:15:36] Messiah hallelujah he was ordained to
[1:15:42] that and you say men he didn't have to
[1:15:45] do that it wasn't him reaching for
[1:15:47] straws and trying to make his place in
[1:15:49] the word this is what's his position lo
[1:15:52] I come in the volume of the book to do
[1:15:56] that which is written of me this was his
[1:16:00] place this was as a position and so when
[1:16:04] the spirit moving down it flows out
[1:16:07] naturally it's not something he had to
[1:16:09] make happen the light nature's had
[1:16:13] brought a union and now here God is
[1:16:16] flowing through that's always the key
[1:16:20] like nature's oh my someone someone
[1:16:28] someone had to be willing to pay the
[1:16:32] penalty
[1:16:40] think about that that's that's that's
[1:16:42] that's me it's tremendous somebody had
[1:16:45] to be willing to pay the penalty think
[1:16:49] of this here's Barabbas taken
[1:16:51] Barabbas don't have a good reputation if
[1:16:56] there's anyone that he might say huh he
[1:16:57] can extinguish him from society this
[1:17:00] guy's been a troublemakers whole time
[1:17:02] he's got a record down at the police
[1:17:03] station but he couldn't pay the penalty
[1:17:12] well who was gonna pay the penalty it's
[1:17:16] gotta be a guilty the guilty one has got
[1:17:18] to pay who is this tight in here in
[1:17:23] there thinking huh the guilty one has
[1:17:27] got to pay but who who could pay the
[1:17:33] guilty couldn't pay it had to be the
[1:17:37] innocent one pay the price when we get
[1:17:47] to looking at ourselves and our
[1:17:48] relationships and everything else I'll
[1:17:50] be the first to tell you I cannot stand
[1:17:53] to say I'm an innocent one but it causes
[1:17:59] us to search because within our hearts
[1:18:02] there's a desire to be reconciled Oh
[1:18:07] when there's a little something that's
[1:18:09] come between me and my wife oh brother
[1:18:12] when we've had some heated discussions
[1:18:16] oh you do you want me to act or what
[1:18:27] but there's something that moves I'm not
[1:18:30] putting myself as an angel there's times
[1:18:32] boy you want to take your I was right on
[1:18:36] this this is right that's right you're
[1:18:41] the head of the house let the wives be
[1:18:44] subject unto the husband and all things
[1:18:49] but watch how the word when it's being
[1:18:52] quoted to you watch what it does to your
[1:18:55] spirit what it does to your spirit will
[1:18:59] tell you the source of where it's coming
[1:19:01] and be careful that you don't reconcile
[1:19:06] you say well I'm reconciling with the
[1:19:08] word but watch what it's doing to your
[1:19:10] spirit because what it's doing to your
[1:19:12] spirit will tell you who it is behind
[1:19:15] the voice if thou be the Son of God is
[1:19:22] that right what was he trying to do the
[1:19:24] spirit was that Satan was trying to
[1:19:27] cover himself by the word and calls the
[1:19:31] Lord Jesus to be reconciled to his wants
[1:19:35] but how do what does the Prophet always
[1:19:38] say he said he didn't clown for the
[1:19:43] devil when we heed we he did that voice
[1:19:47] we're clowning I'll say Amen for
[1:19:51] everybody Lord
[1:19:53] I'm any man but you see how that was in
[1:20:02] it in order to pay the penalty somebody
[1:20:06] even if they're innocent one he who knew
[1:20:10] no sin became why why in order to
[1:20:19] reconcile he was not imputing your trust
[1:20:24] passes are my trust men say hey wait a
[1:20:28] moving with reconciliation Ellison did
[1:20:33] that mean that the Lord Jesus said you
[1:20:35] don't have to repent of anything you
[1:20:36] know nothing no no it but it was see it
[1:20:38] began in here see if the heart of God
[1:20:41] was not on display you could have never
[1:20:42] repented you understand what I'm saying
[1:20:45] but the heart of God here God empties
[1:20:47] himself out now that you might be drawn
[1:20:51] to him and say Lord Lord I come to you
[1:20:54] you're not coming in sir lord I don't
[1:20:56] know if I can I don't know if I can see
[1:20:59] his submission has drawn from you said
[1:21:04] Lord forgive me oh my you love him 1st
[1:21:14] Timothy chapter 2 verse 5 for there is
[1:21:19] one God and one mediator between God and
[1:21:23] men the man Christ Jesus God came down
[1:21:31] created that body and was able to stand
[1:21:34] in the gap for you and me was able
[1:21:39] through this to here hand here
[1:21:42] holy God here on the sinner this was the
[1:21:46] link to restore this link doesn't just
[1:21:56] restore you I'm just a sinner say back
[1:21:58] no no no no no this restores you back to
[1:22:02] the place where you were
[1:22:06] we're all things that were against you
[1:22:09] our struggles the Holy Spirit coming
[1:22:17] ministers that breach to you and I that
[1:22:22] the deed is clear you have the abstract
[1:22:27] the man Christ Jesus look at this who
[1:22:31] gave himself a ransom for all who gave
[1:22:35] himself see this wasn't forced
[1:22:37] he couldn't be forced to do that it
[1:22:39] couldn't be something you know saying
[1:22:40] you know what he had to be he had to
[1:22:43] give himself he had to willingly give
[1:22:47] himself for what for a ransom a ransom
[1:22:54] for all for all to be testified in due
[1:23:02] time my let me go on so here's a
[1:23:05] redeemer its redeemer becoming flesh God
[1:23:15] had not only wrote his Bible in the
[1:23:18] heavens he showed this all in the
[1:23:22] heavens but then God himself he showed
[1:23:25] the plan of redemption of reconciliation
[1:23:28] throughout all throughout the whole
[1:23:30] scriptures but God had spoke to the
[1:23:36] prophets he had revealed himself to
[1:23:39] Abraham he had made himself known to
[1:23:41] Moses all of these were portions of the
[1:23:44] word that were all pointing to him when
[1:23:47] he would come but yet none of them none
[1:23:53] of those within it were able to bring
[1:23:57] about the redemption and look think of
[1:24:02] this let me just make this statement
[1:24:05] here and work with this a moment the
[1:24:08] word itself is spoken what Moses saw
[1:24:10] when Moses remember when Moses saw he
[1:24:13] said he says let me see your face
[1:24:16] is that right let me see your face and
[1:24:18] here God comes down and he speaks he
[1:24:22] says no man could see my face and live
[1:24:25] but what Moses sees ask God puts him on
[1:24:29] the rock he says there's a place by me
[1:24:32] he puts him on the rock and he puts his
[1:24:35] hand over him and then now once he's
[1:24:39] passed by in that in that image that
[1:24:42] supernatural image here he passes by and
[1:24:45] here what he sees Moses sees the hind ER
[1:24:48] parts of a man but you see even though
[1:24:52] God had appeared in many forms he had
[1:24:56] appeared hid coming down with the orphan
[1:24:58] II he appeared in flesh but yet none of
[1:25:01] those comings were the comings of
[1:25:03] redemption they all pointed to it and so
[1:25:09] each one of these words the word
[1:25:10] expressing it was a vision being
[1:25:13] expressed
[1:25:14] but visions don't bleed you with me
[1:25:19] visions don't bleed but the vision has
[1:25:23] got to become manifest the word that was
[1:25:28] spoken all of those things that were
[1:25:31] spoken in type that word must become
[1:25:34] blood in order to fully reconcile the
[1:25:40] word had to become blood in the message
[1:25:43] masterpiece the Prophet says the perfect
[1:25:46] image the god man God in morphe had
[1:25:50] changed from Supernatural to the vision
[1:25:53] and the vision was projected into the
[1:25:57] image so you catch as he's bringing the
[1:26:00] whole condescension down he changed from
[1:26:03] the supernatural to the vision now the
[1:26:06] vision is projected into the image and
[1:26:11] the image was smitten so that the
[1:26:16] supernatural could taste the feeling of
[1:26:21] death
[1:26:23] God can't die but God needed to taste
[1:26:26] death God's perfect masterpiece he
[1:26:32] couldn't do it in Moses he couldn't do
[1:26:33] it in the prophets Isaiah who has solved
[1:26:35] the Saul's till he was solved two pieces
[1:26:37] he could not do it in the prophets they
[1:26:39] were stoned he could not do it because
[1:26:42] he couldn't feel it there was just a
[1:26:45] portion of him but in this perfect
[1:26:48] masterpiece he was the fullness of the
[1:26:51] Godhead bodily he could not only project
[1:26:54] Moses he could project his entire being
[1:26:58] into this person and taste death for the
[1:27:02] whole human race God's perfect
[1:27:04] masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it
[1:27:08] he become the Redeemer of all ages to
[1:27:14] speak for those in the backgrounds who
[1:27:18] have been before and now hold mine when
[1:27:29] the Lord Jesus arias is speaking as he's
[1:27:32] pardon me it's narrowing down
[1:27:35] the purpose of the love is coming it
[1:27:39] keeps on honing in it keeps on honing in
[1:27:44] as it gets closer and closer his purpose
[1:27:47] you see the more of his the maturing of
[1:27:51] the purpose was in his life to that
[1:27:55] place he is begin to see how things
[1:27:58] themselves begin to recede things begin
[1:28:00] to fall off the scripture talks about
[1:28:02] how that you know Bible says many of the
[1:28:04] disciples walked with him the more you
[1:28:06] begin to see as it's narrowing down to
[1:28:08] the purpose that things that was once
[1:28:12] around and hung on no longer are hanging
[1:28:15] on and listen to me that's the same way
[1:28:18] in our life not only has a bride body
[1:28:21] but it's the same way in our life
[1:28:24] individually of where we are in the body
[1:28:27] of Jesus Christ that as we are moving
[1:28:30] further on into that purpose of God then
[1:28:34] you fire
[1:28:35] that there are things that the Holy
[1:28:37] Spirit is pointing out but at the same
[1:28:39] time he's pointing out he is releasing
[1:28:42] to you the authority that is already in
[1:28:45] you to climb above those things why it's
[1:28:48] a honing in on the purpose we're not
[1:28:52] down here at the width of it we're at
[1:28:55] the narrowing of it and the narrowing of
[1:28:58] it there's a greater focus there's a
[1:29:00] greater sharpening there's a grate it's
[1:29:02] not it's it's honed in its zeroed in on
[1:29:05] the target you find the Lord Jesus look
[1:29:07] at this friends this was not just this
[1:29:10] was not a man who was just all he was so
[1:29:12] poised and he was so focused in pilots
[1:29:15] Hall and when they pulled beard out of
[1:29:17] his faith no no this is greater than
[1:29:19] that he was so locked in and it was so
[1:29:22] moved in his heart of what the purpose
[1:29:25] of God was to wear listen he had been
[1:29:28] revealed
[1:29:28] he knew his purpose all along but he
[1:29:31] became more one with that purpose and
[1:29:34] that purpose being expressed in his life
[1:29:37] brother Sam how can you say that because
[1:29:40] even when he himself is pray my soul is
[1:29:43] troubled keep me from this hour but yet
[1:29:47] for this hour came I into the world
[1:29:51] see it's honing in this is where the
[1:29:59] Lord Jesus could say in this time in
[1:30:01] John 12 now is the judgment verse 31 now
[1:30:05] is the judgment of this world now shall
[1:30:08] the Prince of this world be cast out and
[1:30:11] I if I be lifted up from the earth will
[1:30:15] draw all men unto me if I be lifted up
[1:30:19] he couldn't die on the earth he couldn't
[1:30:22] die in the heaven he had to die
[1:30:24] in the expanse in between and that's
[1:30:29] where he comes to receive you and I in
[1:30:30] the rapture it's in the expanse he has
[1:30:33] made a way that he might bring his body
[1:30:36] back to himself hallelujah he is that
[1:30:41] bridge
[1:30:43] hallelujah the heavens were opened glory
[1:30:48] be to God hallelujah I will draw a
[1:30:52] minute to me this word draw means to
[1:30:55] draw to impel inwardly draw in life in
[1:31:02] that vessel unto himself I don't know if
[1:31:12] this life's been drawn because it lives
[1:31:14] the same life he left a sacrificial life
[1:31:19] a life lived by the word and it's not
[1:31:26] you doing it it's him doing it the whole
[1:31:34] secret the whole secret see the people
[1:31:39] even in that time what does this talk
[1:31:41] about the son of man must die what is
[1:31:43] this they were saying that but the whole
[1:31:45] presentation the whole presentation
[1:31:48] where the one of the the one of the
[1:31:50] great secrets is the presentation in his
[1:31:53] death just stay with them gonna hone in
[1:31:57] on this point here this was one of the
[1:31:59] great secrets was the presentation in
[1:32:02] his death what you think of this coming
[1:32:06] back to this thought visions don't bleed
[1:32:09] but the vision must become flesh the
[1:32:14] word must become black
[1:32:16] when Abraham went up there to the
[1:32:19] mountain he was walking up with his
[1:32:24] promised son and he gets up to the
[1:32:27] mountain and he's told take your only
[1:32:30] begotten Son and offer him on the Mount
[1:32:35] that I will show thee God directs into
[1:32:39] this place Abraham walks in complete
[1:32:42] obedience once you think of this these
[1:32:45] things that we have heard for so many
[1:32:48] times
[1:32:49] but how did the profit zeroes right in
[1:32:51] on this and he says about that time when
[1:32:54] Abraham was getting ready had the knife
[1:32:56] in the air and was getting ready to take
[1:32:59] Isaac's life he said the Lord said stay
[1:33:02] your hand and he said immediately
[1:33:05] he's so ram caught in a thicket and the
[1:33:08] Prophet emphasizes it over and over he
[1:33:10] said how could a ram be up there in that
[1:33:14] mountain with the jackals and every
[1:33:16] other predator that could have taken
[1:33:18] that Ram but it was caught by its horns
[1:33:21] its strength God so became one of us he
[1:33:26] got caught and humanity the religious
[1:33:31] jackals the religious jackals tried to
[1:33:35] take him they took counsel together to
[1:33:39] try to kill him but they couldn't take
[1:33:41] him he was under the foreknowledge and
[1:33:44] counsel of God reserved for being
[1:33:49] provided offering for you and I the
[1:33:53] whole secret is in the presentation of
[1:33:56] his death his death was not a forced
[1:33:59] event but here he escapes many times but
[1:34:05] now he comes into a place he's
[1:34:10] submissive in death it's a stage of
[1:34:16] reconciliation where did where did this
[1:34:18] begin what we see on Calvary
[1:34:21] where what we see on Calvary is only a
[1:34:24] manifestation of a victory that was
[1:34:28] already
[1:34:33] hallelujah it was only a manifestation
[1:34:36] of a decision that had already been made
[1:34:41] it wasn't a decision that was lightly
[1:34:43] made if it's possible let this cup pass
[1:34:48] from me there wasn't that he didn't love
[1:34:53] you and I listen to me
[1:34:57] it was his love that kept him there and
[1:35:00] submitting himself in prayer that was
[1:35:04] the love of God listen to me that was
[1:35:07] the love of God that was God himself
[1:35:09] moving in the promise of the word to
[1:35:12] equip his son for the fulfillment the
[1:35:18] love of God how is the word fulfilled by
[1:35:20] the love of God glory be to God
[1:35:35] Philippians 2:7 look at these scriptures
[1:35:42] he made himself of no reputation took
[1:35:49] upon him the form of a servant
[1:35:55] Almighty God come down and become in the
[1:35:58] form of a servant he took upon himself
[1:36:03] the form of a servant this is all
[1:36:07] humility that started in now being
[1:36:11] displayed and was made in the likeness
[1:36:15] of men and being found in fashion as a
[1:36:21] man listen to this he humbled himself
[1:36:29] there was a war going on
[1:36:33] Hebrews 5/7 he was heard in that he
[1:36:38] feared was strong tears and crying the
[1:36:44] Prophet brings a likeness he said he was
[1:36:45] contending with himself who do you
[1:36:50] contend with who do I contend with
[1:36:57] so I brother brems says when you even
[1:36:59] get a thought to think I got a right he
[1:37:04] said the Holy Spirit the dove just takes
[1:37:06] its flight
[1:37:08] who are we contending with it's our will
[1:37:13] vs. God's will but I got news for you
[1:37:20] today greater is He that is in you if
[1:37:27] you're born of the Spirit of God you
[1:37:30] have within you the authority to rise as
[1:37:34] a son to rise as a daughter how do I
[1:37:38] rise the way up is down down so when the
[1:37:48] word goes forth the word strikes here
[1:37:53] see God is doing moving in our life the
[1:37:57] same way he himself has moved down he
[1:38:01] starts in here and comes out and being
[1:38:06] found in fashion as a man can I have
[1:38:08] just a few more moments let me just come
[1:38:11] to this point and being found in fashion
[1:38:13] as a man he humbled himself look at this
[1:38:17] and became obedient unto death remember
[1:38:23] the secret is in the presentation of the
[1:38:26] death he became obedient unto death even
[1:38:32] the death of the cross every moment in
[1:38:37] his life think of it when even they
[1:38:41] pressured him about going the last rest
[1:38:42] tomb and good this time the one whom
[1:38:44] thou lovest he was a lot of
[1:38:46] pressures that came his way there were
[1:38:48] pressures from his brethren John seven
[1:38:50] to declare himself out openly nobody has
[1:38:53] a gift like this and won't declare it
[1:38:54] openly he's getting pressure all around
[1:38:59] he's being pulled every which way and
[1:39:01] he's also bearing all these reproaches
[1:39:04] where people say he's nothing but you
[1:39:06] know this this mockery upon his laying
[1:39:08] all these things listen to this listen
[1:39:10] listen all those things were only items
[1:39:16] to try to divert him from the purpose
[1:39:22] let me tell you friends all of these
[1:39:25] things if we can really step back and
[1:39:27] zero in there are things that come our
[1:39:31] way that only try to divert us from the
[1:39:35] purpose I want to be very clear on this
[1:39:38] I'm not talking about putting your hands
[1:39:41] over your eyes and pretending and
[1:39:42] ignoring that's not what God did but
[1:39:45] what I'm saying is is that it starts
[1:39:47] here where in here there starts a desire
[1:39:52] to do what becoming a light nature
[1:39:57] become analyte nature that's the stages
[1:40:01] of reconciliation he became obedient
[1:40:03] unto death where was this happen where
[1:40:06] did this happen at Oh bill sent me oh
[1:40:09] this is happening
[1:40:09] pilots halt no no what gave him the
[1:40:12] strength to stand in pilot saw was what
[1:40:14] took place in that garden that is where
[1:40:17] the lamb prevailed
[1:40:22] that is where the lamb over came that is
[1:40:25] where the lamb took the book was where
[1:40:31] surrendering not my will that will be
[1:40:35] done he's becoming obedient unto death
[1:40:38] the innocent there's a transfer that's
[1:40:43] being made because it's it's a
[1:40:47] reconciliation here he is overcoming in
[1:40:50] the garden there was a fall in the
[1:40:59] Garden of Eden and here he comes in the
[1:41:04] Garden of Gethsemane there was a fall in
[1:41:09] that garden there's an overcoming in
[1:41:12] this garden garden is figurative of
[1:41:17] bride it's a special designated spot in
[1:41:22] which the king might come and find his
[1:41:28] rest and he overcame in Gethsemane and
[1:41:33] Gethsemane is the squeezing the Olive
[1:41:37] Press what's being squeezed out it's the
[1:41:41] last parts of his will the last parts of
[1:41:48] his will is being squeezed out that the
[1:41:51] purpose might be fulfilled you remember
[1:41:56] what I read to you on Thursday night
[1:41:57] when brother Bram talked about the
[1:41:59] incident within his own life when his
[1:42:00] when his wife was taken in his and his
[1:42:02] daughter remember what brother had said
[1:42:04] he said it was too much Branham and me
[1:42:06] and God had to squeeze out all of that
[1:42:11] that's the same with you and I he said
[1:42:14] God had to squeeze out too much Branham
[1:42:16] he thinks because the purpose of God had
[1:42:18] to be fulfilled it's too much and you
[1:42:20] and me and God keeps squeezing keep
[1:42:23] squeezing what's he doing he's bringing
[1:42:25] us to a place for our will to be so
[1:42:28] completely
[1:42:29] completely submitted to him
[1:42:34] that's what Abraham pro-trade in Genesis
[1:42:40] 22
[1:42:42] I must stay off of the Hackman obedient
[1:42:51] unto death he overcome their brother
[1:42:55] Bram says it like this hiding himself in
[1:43:01] simplicity now he hid himself in the
[1:43:06] death of Christ but manifested himself
[1:43:11] in the resurrection he hid himself in
[1:43:16] the death of Christ Satan did Noah was
[1:43:21] the one look at this Satan not here I
[1:43:23] took Abel I took this one I took this
[1:43:25] one I stone this one I took this one but
[1:43:28] now here comes one and remember the
[1:43:29] prophet dramatizing it he said how Satan
[1:43:32] is watching him carry this cross and the
[1:43:34] blood spots are growing they're merging
[1:43:36] to one big spot he said in Satanist and
[1:43:38] they're saying this can't be the Son of
[1:43:40] God this can't be the Son of God the Son
[1:43:42] of God wouldn't take this but the
[1:43:44] Prophet comes back around he said but
[1:43:46] sons of God will put up as long as they
[1:43:49] know they are doing the will of God how
[1:43:54] could he do it because it was revealed
[1:43:57] to him his purpose and he had so
[1:44:00] surrender to the purpose that nothing
[1:44:03] else mattered nothing else mattered
[1:44:08] that's the same way it is in our lives
[1:44:10] it's yet to be that place that nothing
[1:44:13] else matters
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:20] we'll save you time put my hands on I'm
[1:44:23] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:44:25] where it says nothing else matters
[1:44:27] this cannot remain if it's divisions and
[1:44:33] you don't listen to me
[1:44:34] divisions in your home divisions among
[1:44:37] you hear what much to do you must listen
[1:44:40] to me listen to me it must begin in here
[1:44:44] in here it's not something and say ok oh
[1:44:48] here here we'll do this and do this and
[1:44:50] oh honey I'm sorry you know oh just so
[1:44:52] ignorant I'm just so this or that you
[1:44:54] begin here here it's got to be
[1:44:58] condescending here did he just go to
[1:45:04] Calvary and yet were dead in our sins no
[1:45:08] it was a real real condescension it was
[1:45:16] real it's a stage of reconciliation
[1:45:20] I said I'm closing and I have on
[1:45:25] narrowing it down I'm zeroing in
[1:45:27] can we move and go back to Isaiah 53 and
[1:45:33] look at a couple verses of Scripture
[1:45:36] here Isaiah 53 and I'm gonna close on
[1:45:39] this we'll pick it up next time watch
[1:45:45] this in Isaiah 53 verse 10 yet it
[1:45:54] pleased the Lord to bruise him
[1:46:01] he hath put him to grief he willingly
[1:46:07] submitted when thou shalt make his soul
[1:46:13] an offering for sin he shall see his
[1:46:20] seed he shall prolong his days you're
[1:46:27] the manifestation of those days and the
[1:46:33] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:46:36] his hand look at verse 11 all the rest
[1:46:44] of them are gathered around there and
[1:46:47] they're watching if they'll be the Son
[1:46:49] of God come down off the cross come to
[1:46:51] this all of this but there was a greater
[1:46:56] audience beholding one who was there
[1:47:02] that was tasting the feeling of death
[1:47:06] and he shall see the travail of his soul
[1:47:13] and shall be satisfied what was it it
[1:47:23] was revealing what was in him revealing
[1:47:30] what was in him by his knowledge shall
[1:47:33] my righteous servant justify many for he
[1:47:36] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[1:47:40] will I divide him a portion with the
[1:47:43] Great and he shall divide the spoil with
[1:47:47] the strong he said how the same I know
[1:47:52] he bore our iniquities but how am I
[1:47:55] supposed to bear iniquities how am I
[1:47:58] supposed to do this oh he bore
[1:48:02] iniquities but then he came and he
[1:48:04] speaks to us what does he make known to
[1:48:09] us what does he do to you and I how what
[1:48:12] is this Ministry of reconciliation is to
[1:48:14] make known to you and I the debt has
[1:48:18] already been settled and it calls us to
[1:48:24] repentance to recognize he has already
[1:48:29] Borum away and even listen to me even
[1:48:34] when we are within our families when we
[1:48:37] are among in our church among among
[1:48:40] among different one maybe in your work
[1:48:42] placing your families their outs all of
[1:48:44] these things is it how do I it's not you
[1:48:46] bearing it but it's you bringing that
[1:48:50] very part of and saying Lord this is my
[1:48:53] desire I don't want this to be here so
[1:49:02] how do you how do we move through that
[1:49:04] remember how did he bring us to
[1:49:07] reconciliation not by imputing our
[1:49:11] trespasses but he came to pay the debt
[1:49:16] and sometimes in the paying of the debt
[1:49:20] is simply the coming in a humility and
[1:49:24] said hey you know what can we talk can
[1:49:31] we can we talk yeah you know there's
[1:49:36] some things here that I I want to
[1:49:38] resolve that right there is bearing what
[1:49:46] does it what is moving in reconciliation
[1:49:49] its stages its stages where does it
[1:49:53] start not with the physical action it
[1:49:56] starts here that's why it always starts
[1:49:59] with in a same Lord set my heart right
[1:50:03] if my feelings are not right Lord in
[1:50:06] listen it doesn't do any good it doesn't
[1:50:09] do any good if my feelings are not right
[1:50:11] it doesn't do any good in my family the
[1:50:17] church look I'm a human but this is one
[1:50:25] thing that I do by God's grace and I'm
[1:50:28] more even more acutely aware of it and
[1:50:29] that is the feelings Lord I don't want
[1:50:33] things in my heart I mean that I don't
[1:50:38] want things in my heart if there's
[1:50:40] something there that's hidden bring it
[1:50:42] to light Lord why would that be because
[1:50:45] that's his desire moving upon what he
[1:50:49] placed in my heart to be reside
[1:50:51] reconciled fully because from this
[1:50:55] reconciling of my soul it'll lead to the
[1:50:58] reconciling of the rest of this
[1:51:00] Tabernacle he shall see he shall see you
[1:51:10] see what you might look at a situation
[1:51:12] sometimes in your home and you might
[1:51:15] think how in the world how you might
[1:51:19] look at how in the world Oh somehow look
[1:51:23] at this look at this pattern where does
[1:51:26] it begin here when Lord shall see the
[1:51:32] travail when God sees that desire
[1:51:35] stirred up Lord more than anything Lord
[1:51:38] you watch God move you watch God move
[1:51:43] God moves by his word
[1:51:58] or Jesus father throughout our time and
[1:52:07] our gathering here this morning Lord
[1:52:13] Jesus you're the only one who can really
[1:52:15] really really truly bring your word to a
[1:52:19] place in our lives and our hearts Lord
[1:52:23] Lord to it it finds its place and it
[1:52:28] drops there Lord I pray this morning
[1:52:34] as I and Lord offer prayer for each and
[1:52:38] everyone myself included Lord
[1:52:42] or Jesus if we miss this stage of
[1:52:49] reconciliation that it's through death
[1:52:57] it comes with the cost we could not die
[1:53:01] to pay the penalty but because you were
[1:53:09] willing to die then you who are the
[1:53:13] greater you lead us to a place of dying
[1:53:18] to ourselves to where we might die that
[1:53:22] old nature that old man might die and
[1:53:30] that hidden
[1:53:32] man that's been there down beneath the
[1:53:35] darkness might be brought to light Lord
[1:53:45] we recognize as we see here this morning
[1:53:50] reconciling it comes with a price
[1:53:54] blood had to be shed and it can only be
[1:53:59] by the sacrifice
[1:54:03] of life you sacrificed your life being
[1:54:08] as you spoke to us if any man will deny
[1:54:13] himself
[1:54:16] let him take up his cross and follow me
[1:54:20] daily If any man love a father mother
[1:54:26] brothers sister more than me he's not
[1:54:30] worthy to be my disciple a word calling
[1:54:36] for reconciliation Lord within our
[1:54:43] hearts this morning I pray God if
[1:54:46] there's one that's here that doesn't
[1:54:47] know you they didn't they've never
[1:54:49] surrendered their life to you but yet
[1:54:52] they sense the presence of God the one
[1:54:56] who's been dealing with them Lord and
[1:54:58] they sense even in a greater measure
[1:55:00] this morning Lord the Lord would want to
[1:55:05] come to that place saintil Lord God I'm
[1:55:08] a sinner Lord Jesus forgive me of my
[1:55:14] sins Lord
[1:55:16] Lord I accept that price that you paid
[1:55:21] for my ransom would that I could go free
[1:55:26] not not not try to change myself but I
[1:55:30] could hear that call to go free a call
[1:55:38] of reconciliation dear God I pray this
[1:55:45] morning Lord may Lord you just move Lord
[1:55:52] among the hearts of your children father
[1:55:57] you know every need Lord you know in the
[1:56:01] homes you know in the church you know
[1:56:03] every need lord I pray Heavenly Father
[1:56:06] Oh God
[1:56:09] may we Lord in our hearts
[1:56:13] see that great value in the secret of
[1:56:19] the presentation of death where you hid
[1:56:25] yourself in death that you might
[1:56:33] manifest yourself in the resurrection in
[1:56:38] the death of Christ you hid yourself or
[1:56:40] God when we die in ourselves Lord
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:46] that's a hidden work but it becomes
[1:56:49] manifest Lord I pray the spoon
[1:56:57] I pray God within our hearts may this be
[1:57:02] the very striving as Paul would say let
[1:57:06] us endeavor to keep the unity of the
[1:57:09] bond of peace granite Lord

[2:09:19] with it and as I had an opportunity to

[2:09:26] weeks back or so I I told him I said
[2:09:29] brother Durst God has ordained away that
[2:09:32] we might come I said Peter was given the
[2:09:36] keys to the kingdom of heaven and
[2:09:38] there's an order he was given keys not a
[2:09:42] keeper keys in plural and this time he's
[2:09:46] coming to fulfill part of that when
[2:09:48] Peter opened the doors to the kingdom of
[2:09:51] heaven to the Jews and he went through
[2:09:53] the Samaritan finally he went to
[2:09:55] Cornelius and then the doors were always
[2:09:58] open and no man can shut it but God so
[2:10:02] we're coming here welcoming our brother
[2:10:05] back home so if there's somebody here
