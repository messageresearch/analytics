[19:35] sun was sinking low.
[19:38] He'd overcome the mountain and he'd

[19:43] below. He saw the golden city is
[19:48] [singing] everlasting home. And he

[20:12] While gazing [music] on that city to
[20:15] store [singing] the narrow flood as a
[20:19] band of [music] holy angels came from
[20:22] the throne of God. They pour [music] him
[20:26] on their pinions save for the dashing
[20:30] fold and they join [music] him in his
[20:33] triumph. Deliverance has come. And
[20:39] of victory, [music and singing]
[20:41] crowns of glory,

[20:55] around the throne so grand. They're
[20:58] [music] shouting glad hosanas. We've
[21:02] reached the promised [music] land. And

[21:13] and deliverance
[21:16] has [music] come. And
[21:19] of victory,
[21:21] crowns of glory.
[21:24] Bonds of victory.
[21:28] I shall [music] one more time make pawns
[21:32] of victory. [singing]
[21:34] Crowns of glory. [music]

[26:31] on their knees.
[26:33] They said nothing [singing and music]
[26:35] compared to what is waiting up there.
[26:38] One day we would [music and singing]
[26:39] finally be free.
[26:42] I've never seen it, but I keep on
[26:45] believing it'll be a place like I've
[26:48] never known.
[26:50] I got my [music and singing] eyes on the
[26:51] sky. My soul wants to fly, Lord. My
[26:55] heart is [music] ready to go.
[26:59] I want to know how it feels. Hallelujah.
[27:03] To make my way down the streets of gold.
[27:07] I want to know how it feels [music]
[27:11] to have a talk with the saints of old.
[27:15] I want to know what it's like. [music]
[27:19] to make my feet by the rivers [singing]
[27:22] of life.
[27:24] I've heard of heaven and I know that
[27:26] it's real.
[27:28] I want to know how it feels.
[27:31] See if I can remember it. Sometimes I
[27:34] [music] get weary [singing] from this
[27:36] life that I live. Seems like peace is
[27:38] something I'll never [music and singing]
[27:40] find.
[27:41] I try to lighten my load when all that
[27:44] I've got to show is 700 [music]
[27:47] things on my mind.
[27:50] Oh, but I'm seeing visions of a [music]
[27:52] crystal clear river where sin is
[27:55] vanished without a trace.
[27:58] Oh, more than I've [music] ever dreamed.
[28:00] My soul wants to see the look of love
[28:04] [music] on my Savior's face.
[28:07] I want to know how it feels. [music]
[28:11] to make my way down the streets of gold.
[28:16] I want to know how it feels [music]
[28:20] to my talk with the saints of gold.
[28:24] I want to know what it's like
[28:28] to rest my feet by the rivers [music]
[28:30] of life.
[28:32] I've heard of heaven and I know that
[28:34] it's real.
[28:36] I want to know how it feels one more
[28:39] time.
[28:40] I want to know how [music] it feels
[28:44] to make my way [singing] down those
[28:46] streets of gold.
[28:49] I want to [music] know how it feels
[28:53] to have a talk with the saints [singing]
[28:55] of old.
[28:57] I want to know what it's like
[29:01] to rest my feet by the rivers of life.
[29:05] I've heard [music and singing] heaven
[29:07] and I know that it's real.
[29:10] I want to know how it feels.
[29:14] I've heard heaven and I know that it's
[29:16] real.
[29:18] I want to know how it feels. [music]
[29:24] Hallelujah.
[29:26] Maybe try and restart.
[29:29] It's uh it's sing for memory night. God
[29:33] bless y'all. I hope everybody's got a
[29:34] good memory. I want to sing that. Let's
[29:36] sing that. Remember that song. Cleanse
[29:38] me, oh Lord. Cleanse me, [singing] oh
[29:40] Lord,
[29:42] my heart within.
[29:48] Amen. Try to remember this one. Cleanse
[29:51] me,
[29:53] oh Lord, [singing]
[29:56] and know
[29:58] my heart
[30:00] within.
[30:07] Try
[30:10] me,
[30:13] oh Savior.
[30:17] [singing]
[30:18] Make make
[30:22] me pure
[30:25] within. [singing]
[30:35] I know that verse says, "Thy word de
[30:37] declares, [singing]
[30:39] thou wil provide our need."
[30:43] Thou will
[30:47] provide
[30:50] our need.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:15] Amen. Let's sing that little song. In
[31:17] moments like these, hopefully we can get
[31:18] the words back.
[31:21] In moments [singing]
[31:24] like these,
[31:27] I sing out a song.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; I sing out
[31:36] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[31:37] &gt;&gt; A love song. [music] Amen. To [singing]
[31:41] Jesus. Our pastor comes. Jesus
[31:46] in moments [music]
[31:49] my peace.
[31:52] Amen. I lift [singing] up.
[31:55] [music]
[31:56] &gt;&gt; How many loves times like this with the
[31:58] Lord? Hallelujah.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[31:59] &gt;&gt; I lift up [music]
[32:02] my hands to
[32:05] the Lord [music]
[32:09] singing
[32:12] I
[32:15] love
[32:19] I [music] love you Lord.
[32:22] Jesus
[32:27] love
[32:29] you. [music]
[32:34] Sing it high.
[32:42] You [music]
[32:45] are
[32:48] out
[32:50] [singing]
[32:51] of
[32:54] you.
[32:56] Sing it again. In moments like [music]
[32:57] these, as our pastor comes and sing, in
[33:00] moments [singing]
[33:03] like these,
[33:06] I sing [singing] out [music]
[33:09] a song.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[33:12] &gt;&gt; I sing out
[33:15] a love song
[33:18] [music] to Jesus
[33:21] [singing]
[33:24] in moments
[33:27] like
[33:29] oh I lift [singing] up
[33:33] my hands
[33:36] [music] I lift up [singing]
[33:39] my hands
[33:41] to the Lord. [singing and music]
[33:46] Oh, singing [music]
[33:48] I
[33:51] love [singing]
[33:53] you. Oh, I love you, Lord. [music]
[33:58] Sing
[34:00] I
[34:03] love [singing]
[34:05] you, Lord.
[34:08] [singing and music]
[34:10] Singing
[34:12] my
[34:15] love
[34:18] you.
[34:21] [music]
[34:29] Let's just do that little chorus.
[34:30] Something keeps holding me. Something
[34:33] keeps when the same comes.
[34:39] Something keeps holding me [music]
[34:46] every [singing]
[34:47] day. [music]
[34:48] I see.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; He's helping [singing] me faithfully
[34:58] to overcome [singing]
[35:00] my
[35:02] trials.
[35:07] He's guiding me constantly. [music]
[35:12] Amen.
[35:14] He's giving [music] me victory.
[35:16] [singing]
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [music]
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's a reality. [singing]
[35:26] [music]
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, something keeps holding
[35:30] me. Let's all stand again. The chorus.
[35:32] Something keeps hold of me. Oh,
[35:35] [music and singing] something keeps
[35:37] holding me
[35:41] [singing]
[35:43] every [music]
[35:44] day. I see.
[35:49] [music]
[35:50] &gt;&gt; He's helping me faithfully
[35:54] &gt;&gt; just to overcome [music and singing]
[35:58] my triumph.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:04] &gt;&gt; He's guiding me [singing]
[36:06] constantly,
[36:11] giving me [music]
[36:13] victory.
[36:15] [singing]
[36:19] He's a reality.
[36:24] Something [music]
[36:25] [singing] keeps holding
[36:27] me.
[36:32] Oh, [singing and music] he's a real Yes,
[36:35] Lord Jesus.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus keeps holding [singing]
[36:42] me.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[36:52] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's just go to
[36:55] him in a word of prayer tonight.
[36:57] Heavenly Father,
[37:01] how precious Lord, the songs of Zion,
[37:05] how precious, Lord, your presence
[37:08] &gt;&gt; just coming among us, Lord.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Lord God, truly as you have said in your
[37:14] word, we find it Lord over and over to
[37:17] be the truth. You dwell in the praises
[37:20] of your people,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; oh God. Our our praise and our worship,
[37:25] Lord, is not limited, Lord, to an
[37:28] instrument,
[37:29] our favorite song or even how we feel.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; But Lord, it's based on the liberty
[37:37] &gt;&gt; that we know, Lord, from the depths of
[37:40] our soul.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; That we are no longer the same people
[37:43] that we once [music] were. Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; We see Lord our name written in the
[37:48] Lamb's book of life.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; There's a worship that rises from the
[37:52] depths of our soul. Lord God, while we
[37:55] are here, even in these temporary
[37:57] booths, these dwelling places, these
[38:01] mortal bodies, but Lord God, how we are
[38:04] so thankful, Lord, for the liberty that
[38:07] has come
[38:08] &gt;&gt; into our lives, Lord.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, we so appreciate you,
[38:13] Father. Amen.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; That in itself, Lord God, we could never
[38:18] never praise you enough. [music]
[38:20] I'm so glad that we'll have eternity to
[38:23] do that. There's so much that you have
[38:26] done for us. But Lord Jesus,
[38:30] the greatest thing is when you not only
[38:33] you came, but Lord, you made that
[38:35] deposit in our lives. Oh my, I'm so
[38:39] thankful Lord, so grateful Lord for your
[38:42] leadership in our lives. how you would
[38:44] guide us, Lord, from day to day and
[38:46] moment to moment, Lord.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Father, even in the correction,
[38:51] Lord, even in the strength that you
[38:54] would give us through the tests and
[38:55] trials that you permit to come our way.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; We thank you for your mercies, Lord.
[39:02] Lord, there's many requests, many things
[39:04] that Lord, you see that came on the
[39:07] thread for prayer here throughout today.
[39:10] Many different needs, [music] Lord.
[39:13] those that Lord in need of of comfort,
[39:16] Lord. And I pray for brother Brian's
[39:18] family that you would just comfort them,
[39:20] Lord. I pray
[39:23] &gt;&gt; comfort them, Lord Jesus, with your
[39:25] presence, Lord. Be with our brother, his
[39:27] family, Lord. I pray, dear God, that for
[39:30] the different needs, Lord, different
[39:33] different ones battling, Lord, with
[39:34] sickness and things. And we know that
[39:36] Lord, it it makes its way around at
[39:39] certain times of the year. But it's
[39:41] only, Lord, a reminder that we've not
[39:44] arrived home yet. Father, we're on our
[39:47] way. So Lord Jesus, was you've provided
[39:50] for us what we have need of along the
[39:53] way. That you promised that you would,
[39:56] Lord Jesus, minister [music] to the
[39:58] infirmities in our bodies. You would
[40:00] heal us as you said in your word. You
[40:02] would lift the sicknesses, Lord. So we
[40:05] ask God for each need and every request
[40:08] here tonight. Be with those Lord that
[40:10] may be just dear God in our mind or
[40:13] spirit just weary and just in need of
[40:16] Lord just encouragement from your
[40:18] presence tonight. Lord Jesus, I pray
[40:21] that you would just pass by each one of
[40:25] our hearts tonight, Lord. And may you so
[40:28] minister in such a way, Lord, that would
[40:30] encourage us, Lord, in our walk with
[40:33] you. We pray we love you and we thank
[40:36] you now Lord in Jesus precious name.
[40:40] Amen.
[40:42] Amen. Thank you. Amen.
[40:45] Amen. Let's look here in the word here
[40:47] in Galatians 5 and want to move right
[40:50] back into this and say it's good to be
[40:53] in the house of the Lord tonight and
[40:56] good to be together and certainly want
[40:58] to remember one another in prayer and I
[41:00] know different ones of battling sickness
[41:03] and different things in their body and
[41:05] but we just look to the Lord to minister
[41:08] to them in a special way. In Galatians
[41:11] chap in Galatians chapter 5 verse3
[41:17] says for brethren ye have been called
[41:20] unto liberty only use not liberty for an
[41:24] occasion to the flesh. Now Paul would
[41:28] have never wrote this if there wasn't a
[41:31] possibility for this to be that whole
[41:35] phrase an occasion to the flesh it is
[41:37] actually selfishness
[41:40] and I know we all would like to think
[41:42] that we still don't have selfishness but
[41:46] yet there's a lot of self about us and
[41:50] that's one thing that where the new
[41:52] birth has come the new birth actually
[41:54] breaks that hold and that power from
[41:57] within and then through that constantly
[42:01] in our lives where the spirit of God
[42:03] will not do this for us. But we have to
[42:06] surrender to him.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; So there's certain things that you and
[42:11] I, we couldn't clean our lives up. We
[42:13] could not perfect our soul. That was not
[42:16] something that we could ever do. But God
[42:18] now through and by the new birth entrust
[42:21] you and I to actually take by the spirit
[42:24] of God and an awareness and actually
[42:27] bring our lives into subjection
[42:31] submitting ourselves over and over to
[42:34] the word of God. Is it something that's
[42:36] easy? No. If it if it right there in the
[42:39] garden of Gethsemane when the Lord Jesus
[42:42] he prayed three times. And I want you to
[42:45] think about how God so condescended to
[42:48] allow himself to experience the things
[42:51] that you and I would experience. When he
[42:55] would experience the cost of obedience,
[42:57] it wasn't that he had within him some
[43:00] sort of a disobedience such as what
[43:02] would still be in our carnal nature. He
[43:05] didn't have that. But yet the flesh made
[43:08] in the likeness of sinful flesh. There
[43:11] was a cost in obedience. It was a cost
[43:15] for everything that when he would stand
[43:17] for the word, he knew the ridicule. He
[43:20] knew the misunderstandings. He knew the
[43:22] reproach. He knew that. And even when it
[43:25] came to uh in every in every part of his
[43:29] life, but he was willing to do that. And
[43:32] it was a constant constant submission.
[43:36] And you know, you think of that until
[43:37] the day that we are raptured out of
[43:39] here, it will be a continual submission
[43:43] moment by moment by moment. But aren't
[43:45] you glad that God has given you the
[43:47] grace?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; I am. Not only to be able to do it, but
[43:51] to even to recognize it and to be able
[43:53] to see that. So
[43:56] notice how the last part of that verse,
[43:59] but by love serve or do service to one
[44:05] another. For all the law is fulfilled in
[44:08] one word, even in this, thou shalt love
[44:12] thy neighbor as thyself.
[44:17] But if you bite and devour one another,
[44:20] take heed that you be not consumed one
[44:22] another. So there's that's a possibility
[44:25] there as well too.
[44:27] This I say then walk in the spirit and
[44:31] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[44:33] flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the
[44:36] spirit and the spirit against the flesh
[44:40] and these are contrary the one to the
[44:42] other so that you cannot do the things
[44:45] that you would. But if you be led of the
[44:48] spirit,
[44:50] ye are not under the law. Amen. May God
[44:54] bless you and bless the reading of the
[44:55] word as you're being seated. I want to
[44:58] continue to by the grace of God to try
[45:00] to finish this point on a liberty
[45:04] to serve. A liberty to serve. And I want
[45:08] to just take of those maybe just three
[45:11] questions to kind of look at here even
[45:13] this evening. What does it mean
[45:16] to serve? How do I serve? And what is
[45:20] the motivation
[45:22] of the serving?
[45:24] You know, brother Bram talks throughout
[45:28] the message. There's many different
[45:29] places where he deals with how that the
[45:33] love
[45:35] would actually be a very hard thing or
[45:37] very scarce thing to find. And he would
[45:41] say it in one way. He said, "It's too
[45:42] bad that we lost that kind of love one
[45:46] for another." And what he goes in to
[45:47] talk about is how that Mary actually ran
[45:52] to Elizabeth after she had her
[45:54] visitation. And then Elizabeth, they met
[45:56] one another and there was such a joy.
[45:59] There was such a, you know, a a
[46:02] fellowship. And brother Brandham would
[46:04] go on and I think now this is these are
[46:06] statements brother Brandham is making
[46:07] clear back in the late 50s and 60s where
[46:10] he says we're at a place right now he
[46:12] said we won't even know if the neighbor
[46:14] dies unless we read about it in the
[46:16] newspaper.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Now we realize that the spirit of God is
[46:20] not telling us to you know stick our
[46:22] nose in everybody's business.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; That's not at all because Paul calls out
[46:26] busy bodies.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; You know he he deals with that. But that
[46:30] there's a there's a great difference in
[46:31] this that where that there is a care and
[46:34] we we're living in a time in an hour.
[46:37] We're not helpless. We're not defeated.
[46:40] But we're living in a time because of
[46:42] the age, the anointing upon this age,
[46:45] remember, is the anointing of people's
[46:47] rights.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; So it's all about self. This is why we
[46:50] see a lot of the things come about as
[46:52] they do. And it is a spirit that we have
[46:55] to continue to battle against. It's a
[46:58] spirit so easily that even in a
[47:00] workplace you have to be very careful.
[47:02] You can get caught up so much within
[47:04] that and it would actually vex your
[47:07] spirit to a time you have to be careful
[47:09] because in the people and everyone else
[47:11] the anointing is there and it can move
[47:13] upon even upon your spirit in those ways
[47:16] and we need to be very very mindful and
[47:19] ask the Lord to help us within these
[47:21] things because it can it's such an age
[47:23] of such selfishness and yet it is an age
[47:27] where God has chosen to rapture his
[47:30] bride and to where that his bride would
[47:32] come to the absolute place to be capped
[47:36] in rapturing grace. And it's really
[47:38] quite it's really quite a marvel that
[47:40] you we would look at the conditions of
[47:43] the age, but yet it's not the conditions
[47:45] of the age that remember drives the
[47:47] bride to Christ. It's not the conditions
[47:50] of the age that actually make us more
[47:52] godly, but it is actually God fulfilling
[47:55] his word and in the presence of the word
[47:59] being revealed. That's what has the
[48:01] effect upon our life because what go
[48:04] everything that God is asking of us, God
[48:07] does not want us to do anything out of a
[48:10] duty to where it's just well I I have to
[48:12] do this and I must do this. And yet
[48:15] there's some things that God will ask us
[48:17] ask of us and we'll begin to see in his
[48:19] word that you know it it will feel as
[48:22] though that we're just maybe going
[48:24] through the motions when we give
[48:25] ourselves to the Lord. But yet, in order
[48:28] to give ourselves to the Lord, it starts
[48:29] with our hearts. And there's certain
[48:32] things that you know, let me just put it
[48:33] to you like this. If there's a time that
[48:35] you have somehow gotten away from maybe
[48:37] holding your wife's hand or something
[48:39] like that and you know now nowadays I
[48:42] know how the cars are made to where
[48:44] everything a console down the middle and
[48:46] man probably we brothers we like that
[48:48] console and sisters like it if they can
[48:49] had hide their little things down the
[48:51] middle of the console you know and all
[48:53] those neat little things but yet you
[48:55] know to start start little things like
[48:58] that you know back over sometimes it
[49:01] feels a little bit strange or a little
[49:03] bit odd. But yet you find that with
[49:05] obedience itself, obedience, many times
[49:08] we have to go beyond our feelings. And
[49:10] then from the inside, this is where then
[49:12] feelings will actually come and God will
[49:15] supply those feelings. And I say that
[49:17] because there's many things that we can
[49:20] do. And yet it'll be like if we if we
[49:23] don't if things are not done from that
[49:25] of really divine love, it's not even
[49:28] attributed to our account. It'd be like
[49:30] after every payday you were taking out
[49:33] $100 and you were having $100 go to this
[49:35] sub account, $50 go to this sub account,
[49:38] $25 go into this sub account, and you
[49:40] just, you know, had that automatically
[49:42] with your automatic deposit. And then
[49:44] when it when it came time at the end,
[49:46] let's say a year down the road, you were
[49:49] expecting, well, if I had $100 a month,
[49:51] it'd be 1,200 at the end of the road. If
[49:53] it was $50 a month, you know, well,
[49:54] that'd be 600 at the end of the year,
[49:56] and so forth. And yet when you get then
[49:58] to the end of the year, what you find is
[50:00] on the statements 0000. And I tell you,
[50:04] you probably would be like, "Hey,
[50:05] something's going on with the accounting
[50:07] right here." But you realize that Paul
[50:10] writes of this in 1 Corinthians 13 and
[50:12] he says, "Though I give my body to be
[50:14] burned." you know, all of the service
[50:17] that could be done in all of the service
[50:19] I could that could be done even when he
[50:20] deals with uh you know, speaking in
[50:22] tongues and all those things if it is
[50:24] not with that of charity, it that rings
[50:27] up as zero in the account.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't want us to do things just
[50:33] because it's the right thing to do,
[50:36] &gt;&gt; but he wants to really that our hearts
[50:38] would be moved by divine love. And this
[50:41] is why when brother Brandon would say it
[50:43] like this, he says, "Love is so hard to
[50:45] find." The Bible said there'd come a
[50:48] time when there wouldn't even be love
[50:51] for one another. Father would be against
[50:53] mother, mother against father, and
[50:55] children against parents and so forth.
[50:57] And the only love would be left would
[50:59] just be between the elect. And that's
[51:02] about right. Love is a scarce thing
[51:06] today.
[51:07] And you find you realize that even when
[51:10] love itself is so hard to find because
[51:13] the love that the prophet is talking
[51:14] about is not the love that would just be
[51:17] upon in our human spirit because there
[51:19] is the gate of affection that is there.
[51:22] When we realize that from agape love,
[51:24] it's that stream. It's a stream of love
[51:26] that comes all the way on down until it
[51:28] gets even to the very bottom where it's
[51:30] really it's perverse love. But yet
[51:32] within it, we recognize that this love
[51:35] that we're speaking of that's so hard to
[51:37] find. It's hard to find because it is
[51:40] indeed rare. It is the Holy Spirit that
[51:43] is actually shed abroad in the hearts of
[51:45] God's people. And you can actually see
[51:47] it. You sense it where the love of God
[51:49] is absolutely lifting from the earth.
[51:52] You see it sometimes in meetings. You
[51:54] see it in services. You know, one times
[51:57] where we would see the throngs of
[51:58] things. And yet we find in this time
[52:00] we're living in where the love of God is
[52:03] absolutely lifting from the earth. The
[52:05] Bible says that men would be in this day
[52:08] without natural affection.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; The those very things would be so
[52:14] removed. There's a lot of a lot of
[52:16] factors and things that come into that.
[52:18] But yet with within it when we look at
[52:20] it, you remember brother Brandham was
[52:22] asked a question in 1964. Brother Bram,
[52:24] he says, 'Why is it so hard to pray
[52:27] right now? And brother Bram says the
[52:30] reason he says you find it so hard to
[52:32] pray, he says, is because the revival is
[52:35] over. He says it's not easy to do or to
[52:39] pray as you used to be able to. So we
[52:43] find that even through that pressure
[52:45] because you know a lot of times we look
[52:46] back at things and you find things you
[52:48] know you find you know people as they
[52:50] sometimes they get older they want to go
[52:52] back and live you know back days when
[52:54] they were you know 20 or 25 or whatever
[52:56] more and want to go back and reminisce
[52:58] about a lot of things and yet we also
[53:00] realize that there's things as God moves
[53:02] within the seasons of his word and of
[53:04] times is that sometimes where a person
[53:06] can actually be trying to get back to a
[53:09] place that God has already moved on from
[53:12] and God just and and it actually becomes
[53:14] not a place of destiny. It actually
[53:16] becomes a mirage. It becomes something
[53:18] they're looking at doing and they're or
[53:20] getting back to, man, we're going to get
[53:21] back to this. And yet God has already
[53:24] there's been an advancement and it never
[53:26] advances beyond the word, but God moves
[53:28] through his word and he's all it's
[53:30] always a constant moving and working
[53:33] within the lives of the people. And so
[53:36] God always sets a clear expectation and
[53:39] when in our lives and so when we look at
[53:41] this with a real liberty to serve when
[53:44] our hearts have been really set at
[53:46] liberty then the ways and what we would
[53:49] actually do would would be from that of
[53:52] love or should be from love you know and
[53:54] sometimes a person can do something and
[53:57] maybe they feel like that they're doing
[53:59] it from love and if you ask them why did
[54:01] you do that well I do it because it how
[54:03] how it makes me feel That's not this
[54:06] love. It's not about how it makes you
[54:08] feel. That that's not what this love is
[54:10] about. Because this love is the divine
[54:13] love of God. It's a love that is not
[54:15] about what we do as for our betterment.
[54:18] That if I do this then others are going
[54:20] to think well of me. They'll think good
[54:22] of me. Or if I do this then maybe my
[54:24] wife or my husband will pay me
[54:26] patronage. If I do this then you know
[54:28] the brother or the sister. If I and and
[54:30] that becomes it becomes a very selfish
[54:33] thing or reason that we're doing that
[54:35] and yet and yet there's an element that
[54:38] we have to understand that love is also
[54:41] a part to be reciprocated. How could you
[54:43] and I love the Lord Jesus with the right
[54:46] kind of love if he didn't express his
[54:49] love to you and I? There's no way we
[54:52] could we could never love to the degree
[54:53] that he calls for unless he himself
[54:56] would have expressed his love to you and
[54:58] I. And that is what's captured our
[55:00] hearts. But thanks thanks be to God that
[55:03] through that it's not our love that
[55:05] we're loving him with. And what love are
[55:07] we loving him with? We're loving him
[55:08] with his love. And that's exactly what
[55:11] it is. It's the Holy Spirit, divine love
[55:13] that's been deposited in our heart. And
[55:15] that continues to work in our life to
[55:18] mold us to melt down all of our
[55:20] self-will and all of these things. So
[55:22] notice how Paul would write this on this
[55:25] in this with Hebrews 6. For God is not
[55:28] unrighteous to forget your work and
[55:31] labor of love,
[55:34] which you have showed toward his name,
[55:37] in that you have ministered to the
[55:39] saints, and do minister.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice how this is wrote
[55:44] here. God's not unrighteous. Nobody else
[55:47] may not see this, which it really
[55:49] doesn't matter if anybody else sees it
[55:50] or knows it.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; It's that God sees it. God knows it. And
[55:54] to whatever degree and however that this
[55:57] this right here, we could spend a whole
[55:59] month on this because all of the
[56:01] variegated ways that this would actually
[56:04] be that would actually come through the
[56:06] body in so many different ways. And you
[56:09] know what? Many of the things that we
[56:10] look at right here, even in looking at
[56:12] this, there is even a portion of this
[56:14] that when you look at it that as far as
[56:16] would it be anything spiritual, many of
[56:19] these things even in this right here, it
[56:21] would not even be deemed to be spiritual
[56:23] at all. But yet it's taking notice of
[56:26] the body that's around us. Now I know
[56:28] many many times we look at things and we
[56:31] think about oh my the depth of the word
[56:33] and the mysteries and so forth. But if
[56:35] that doesn't have any outworking in our
[56:37] lives, I'm afraid something's wrong
[56:40] somewhere. God did not want to just
[56:42] deposit divine, you know, understanding
[56:44] and mysteries and all of these things
[56:47] that we would walk around and oh well,
[56:49] we're always available to sit down and
[56:51] debate or discuss and that's not what
[56:54] that's not what we need. The body needs
[56:57] ministered to.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; If you'll notice the Lord Jesus, he
[57:00] never even occupied himself very very
[57:03] minute times of even and I won't even
[57:05] say debating because the prophet said
[57:07] that's not even the Christian spirit. He
[57:09] did not even do that in that way. As a
[57:11] matter of fact, there might be a
[57:13] question, might be something that would
[57:14] pause. But what you find a lot of times,
[57:16] the Lord Jesus would absolutely be able
[57:19] to remove himself from that situation.
[57:22] Why? He knew it wasn't going to it
[57:24] wasn't going to do any good anyhow. So
[57:26] when we see this within it, yet the Lord
[57:28] Jesus, if he would have come here, I
[57:30] want you to think about this. His one
[57:32] purpose in order to come here was for
[57:35] redemption. and he did fulfill that of
[57:39] lifting our burdens that of uh
[57:41] ministering to the sick. But if he would
[57:44] have just come here and it would have
[57:46] been simply just to come here and then
[57:49] at the appointed time go to Calvary and
[57:52] nothing else that would have been that
[57:54] wouldn't have taken much to write about.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't have taken much. But yet
[58:00] what we find all the way through the
[58:03] gospels is over and over through the
[58:06] gospels and then you find it through the
[58:08] book of acts. You find it through Paul
[58:10] admonishing in Hebrews, Galatians, all
[58:12] the letters. You find a life that was
[58:15] lived in the express where God himself
[58:18] came down and became a servant unto all
[58:22] men. Yes, I did.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; We have in we have countless records of
[58:27] even different ones that he served their
[58:30] needs and we have no record. Do not know
[58:33] did they even serve him.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Different ones that he healed.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; You have different ones even in brother
[58:40] Brandham's meetings
[58:43] didn't go on and SERVE HIM. BUT YET GOD
[58:45] came down
[58:47] &gt;&gt; and touched him.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz God loves humanity. Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how much God loves
[58:54] humanity. God loves humanity so much and
[58:57] wanted humanity to be well that he knew
[59:00] that there would be a many of humanity
[59:02] that would not even believe in divine
[59:03] healing. So God provided doctors.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; You talking about love? You talking
[59:11] about he could have drawn a line in the
[59:13] sand and said if you don't believe in
[59:15] divine healing then you just suffer.
[59:18] but God's love for humanity because it
[59:21] wasn't men's ingenuity that tapped into
[59:24] different things.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, why would brother
[59:26] Brandham say over and over when it came
[59:28] to even the polio vaccine, you know,
[59:31] brother Brandon prayed about that, had
[59:32] the church praying about that? Brother
[59:34] Brandham was ecstatic when they came
[59:36] along with that
[59:38] &gt;&gt; because many of those things had wiped
[59:40] out. There's places even in Sunduski
[59:42] right down there on the bay. You'd
[59:43] actually have to go to a certain
[59:44] destination and they've got the pillar
[59:46] rays from where that of the black plague
[59:48] had went through there and wipe people
[59:50] out in that area
[59:51] &gt;&gt; where we used to where my family used to
[59:54] live. But think how brother Brown would
[59:56] say over and over. He said, "Every day I
[59:59] pray that they would have a cure for
[1:00:02] cancer
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; now." And what didn't brother Bon say? I
[1:00:05] pray every day that everybody would come
[1:00:08] into my meetings.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; It was a love for humanity.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Do you realize even as I've I've been
[1:00:15] around, you know, some of my my best
[1:00:17] friends are right there within
[1:00:18] Jeffersonville and and things and and
[1:00:20] different brothers and all of the
[1:00:22] different uh you know testimonies and
[1:00:24] things that you hear and you see even of
[1:00:26] the man who testifies about the bridge
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; there. His last name is Vissing. He's a
[1:00:31] lawyer. He was actually served as mayor
[1:00:33] in Jeffersonville. Voice of God put him
[1:00:35] on an interview. You can pick it up on
[1:00:37] YouTube. And he goes into explaining why
[1:00:39] certain records were not kept upon that
[1:00:41] of men dying when the bridge was being
[1:00:43] built. And even to even when you watch
[1:00:46] watch and hear the things that he says
[1:00:48] and then you hear among other people,
[1:00:49] you know, brother B was loved by the
[1:00:51] Catholics.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; They loved him in Jeffersonville.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; They loved him. Not because he went
[1:00:56] along with their doctrine, but the
[1:00:58] things that you hear testimonies about
[1:01:00] brother Brandham is how brother Brandham
[1:01:02] himself would actually when he would go
[1:01:04] and he would kill the animals bear and
[1:01:06] different things like that, he would
[1:01:08] actually come around and hand it to
[1:01:10] people that he knew were in need and
[1:01:12] they didn't even go to the Brandom
[1:01:13] Tabernacle.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You see, it's service, friends.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not talking about going out
[1:01:20] here. I'm not I don't want I'm not
[1:01:21] talking about going out here and
[1:01:23] standing with a red tripod and dingling
[1:01:25] lingaling,
[1:01:27] you know, and waiting, you know, drop in
[1:01:28] your pennies and drop in you better drop
[1:01:30] them in pennies and things and and
[1:01:32] nickels and so forth. That's not what
[1:01:33] we're talking about. Brother Brandham
[1:01:35] made such a difference here by the
[1:01:37] spirit of God between religion and
[1:01:38] salvation. He said religion, he said
[1:01:40] many will take on religion and they'll
[1:01:43] feed the poor. He said any goodnatured
[1:01:46] human being would do that. But salvation
[1:01:50] is a real experience with God. And it's
[1:01:53] something that when you can recognize
[1:01:55] and you just dwell on it and it becomes
[1:01:57] more and more real in our lives of what
[1:01:59] God so subjected himself in order to
[1:02:03] bring this liberty to you and I of what
[1:02:05] of to what degree and what he continues
[1:02:08] to do in ministering to the needs in our
[1:02:11] life. God God never just saved us and
[1:02:13] put us on autopilot. But over and over
[1:02:15] through the admonishing of the word, he
[1:02:18] admonishes us. He doesn't make us, but
[1:02:21] he reveals himself and then you and I as
[1:02:24] yielding and then submitting and then
[1:02:26] subjecting and you know just emptying
[1:02:29] ourselves and saying Lord just let that
[1:02:31] be in my life. And so here when we see
[1:02:34] this your work and labor of love which
[1:02:37] you minister toward his name. So the
[1:02:39] expression of that work and labor of
[1:02:42] love in that you have ministered to the
[1:02:44] saints and do minister. Watch out,
[1:02:47] brother Brandon. He picks this up in
[1:02:49] questions and answers. He says, "Now,
[1:02:51] we're all going to make mistakes. Just
[1:02:54] remember, when you're looking at one
[1:02:56] another, don't look at the other
[1:02:58] person's mistake.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Don't do that." Because remember, you
[1:03:03] make mistakes, too.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But look to Christ who is guiding
[1:03:08] this person.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Bra, I don't even think,
[1:03:11] brother Samuel, I don't even think they
[1:03:12] have the Holy Ghost. Remember the Holy
[1:03:15] Ghost, justification, that's a part of
[1:03:17] the Holy Ghost. Sanctification, more of
[1:03:20] the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost is more of
[1:03:25] the same that's been working all along.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. The worst thing that we could ever
[1:03:32] do is sit around and criticize one
[1:03:36] another.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; The worst thing to be able to do is to
[1:03:40] sit around and be able to pick apart and
[1:03:43] well, if this one or I don't see this in
[1:03:45] the church, I don't see this and I don't
[1:03:46] see that. You need to get your eyes in
[1:03:48] the right place
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; because to understand, you know, I'll
[1:03:52] just be honest with you friends. I I
[1:03:54] don't like I don't like criticism. I
[1:03:56] don't like complaining. But yet I
[1:03:57] realize there's a part of it that I have
[1:03:59] to be able to kind of to deal with and
[1:04:01] things. I BECAUSE THERE'S AN ATMOSPHERE
[1:04:03] that it creates. I I don't want to be
[1:04:05] around that because I KNOW THAT THAT'S
[1:04:07] NOT of God.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; God does not anoint us to pick one
[1:04:13] another apart.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, PART OF THAT BITING and
[1:04:17] devouring one another, it don't
[1:04:18] necessarily mean that we're biting their
[1:04:20] nose off, BITING THEIR HEAD OFF. YOU CAN
[1:04:22] BITE and devour one another behind their
[1:04:25] back
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; where you can talk and say, "Well, what?
[1:04:28] I don't understand. WHY IS THIS AND
[1:04:30] WHY'S THAT?" THIS IS WHERE IT comes into
[1:04:33] praying for one another.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Let me finish the quote. Brother Bram
[1:04:38] says, "If they need some help, then you
[1:04:41] pray for them."
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; That's the way we get along. Pray. WHEN
[1:04:46] YOU ARE PRAYING for somebody else in
[1:04:48] that kind of a fix, what kind of fix he
[1:04:50] talking about? a mistake that we can
[1:04:52] see.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; When you're praying for somebody else
[1:04:56] who's in that kind of a fix, God will
[1:04:58] honor and heal you when you're praying
[1:05:01] for somebody else.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; So, you mean that God would allow me to
[1:05:06] see somebody else's mistake? Yeah. And
[1:05:09] he's also wanting to test
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; I wonder where the maturity is at.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that,
[1:05:16] Samuel? Are you going to are you going
[1:05:18] to talk about them? Are you going to act
[1:05:19] as though that you are better? You know
[1:05:21] more? Are you going to forget where I
[1:05:24] brought you from? ARE YOU GOING TO
[1:05:25] FORGET EVERYTHING THAT I LOOKED OVER in
[1:05:28] your life? What what what are we going
[1:05:30] to do? Or are we going to remember and
[1:05:33] look at that we make mistakes too.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; That includes every one of us.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. And now within this of
[1:05:41] praying, when they get in that kind of
[1:05:43] fix, but if we go to entering in and
[1:05:45] praying for them, God, as the prophet
[1:05:47] said, will honor and heal you when
[1:05:50] you're praying for somebody else.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; You know what that takes? That takes
[1:05:55] service.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Because what it is, it takes us to go
[1:05:59] beyond that LITTLE BIT BECAUSE PRIDE IS
[1:06:02] STILL within us, friends. And I'm not
[1:06:04] When the Holy Spirit has come, it's
[1:06:06] delivered from our soul. But it's always
[1:06:08] that tendency. And sometimes depending
[1:06:10] on how we're made up, some might have a
[1:06:12] greater tendency to where everything all
[1:06:14] they can look at is they'll look at
[1:06:16] things and they'll say, "Yep, this one's
[1:06:18] got the part. Yep. Exactly. This is
[1:06:20] applied. Tokens applied. I've learned
[1:06:22] long ago. This may be all right on the
[1:06:24] outside. That don't mean the tokens
[1:06:26] applied. Many, many years ago, I learned
[1:06:29] that that has nothing to do to say that
[1:06:33] a person has already made the mark."
[1:06:36] Yes.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; But you can take God can start on the
[1:06:40] inside of a person and when the work
[1:06:42] that God does in that person, you watch
[1:06:45] things start to fall off on the outside.
[1:06:47] That's why the prophet SAID WHEN NEW
[1:06:49] LIFE has come in, you don't have to
[1:06:50] pluck the old leaves off. They will fall
[1:06:54] off.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; But to know that within this it requires
[1:06:59] a service. Now how would I serve? Now,
[1:07:01] this is something that for me or you, it
[1:07:03] would not be something that would us
[1:07:05] maybe be going physically to THAT
[1:07:07] PERSON, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT GOD
[1:07:09] ALLOWS us to be able to see. Maybe it's
[1:07:12] something you hear about. AND HOW ARE
[1:07:14] YOU GOING to respond to that? It's I
[1:07:16] believe the greatest response we can do
[1:07:18] is to take it to God in prayer. DO YOU
[1:07:20] REALIZE THE THINGS THAT GOD ALLOWS US TO
[1:07:22] SEE? God allows us, permits us to see
[1:07:25] THESE THINGS, NOT TO talk about them,
[1:07:27] but to go in prayer. Because remember we
[1:07:30] are priests and priests are to surrender
[1:07:32] their lives as the prophet said spending
[1:07:34] our lives interceding and petitioning on
[1:07:38] thy behalf of one another.
[1:07:41] Notice brother Ram says that's what
[1:07:44] Christianity is based upon to help one
[1:07:48] another do for one another be kind to
[1:07:51] one another understanding to one
[1:07:53] another. Now, if you see your neighbor's
[1:07:55] mistake, you see where they went wrong,
[1:07:57] don't go wrong with them, but just pray
[1:07:59] for them. Just keep praying and God will
[1:08:02] understand that he'll make everything
[1:08:06] right. Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Now watch how the Lord Jesus himself
[1:08:10] when you consider this of how that in
[1:08:13] the in the midst of divine love and
[1:08:15] where he was within his life. Here's
[1:08:18] some of the very last moments of his
[1:08:20] life. Many many miracles had taken place
[1:08:24] within his ministry walking on the
[1:08:26] water. We've seen devils cast out. We've
[1:08:28] seen all so many so many powerful
[1:08:31] things. But the last closing moments of
[1:08:34] his ministry, what we find is where he
[1:08:37] rose from supper and he girded himself
[1:08:41] with a towel.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And this is I always love this
[1:08:45] scripture, this verse right here. It's
[1:08:47] so powerful. JESUS KNOWING THAT THE
[1:08:51] FATHER had given all things into his
[1:08:53] hand and that he was come from God and
[1:08:56] went to God. HE RISETH FROM SUPPER and
[1:08:59] laid aside his garments and took a towel
[1:09:02] and girded himself. THIS IS WHAT
[1:09:06] MATURITY did in HIS LIFE.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; IT BROUGHT TO THAT APEX OF SERVICE where
[1:09:13] even Peter WAS AT THE POINT, NO, YOU'RE
[1:09:15] NOT GOING TO WASH ME. NOT YOU, LORD. NOT
[1:09:17] NOT YOU. I I DON'T WANT YOU TO STOOP TO
[1:09:19] THIS LEVEL. BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAD HE
[1:09:22] STOOPED TO BECOME A HUMAN,
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; but he had stooped day after day
[1:09:29] humbling himself.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And he took on the lowest job that could
[1:09:35] be
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; a foot wash flunky.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; And you know what? That in itself still
[1:09:41] was not to the lowest that he would go.
[1:09:44] He would go to Calvary
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; for you and I. That's right.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; HE WENT FOR YOU AND I. IT WAS NOT
[1:09:51] BECAUSE OF HIS BENEFIT, BUT IT WAS FOR
[1:09:53] OUR BENEFIT.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HE WENT FOR THE JOY THAT
[1:09:59] WAS SET BEFORE HIM. WHAT JOY [screaming]
[1:10:01] IS THAT? HE SAW YOU AND ME SITTING HERE
[1:10:04] FREE AND IN LIBERTY TONIGHT. HE SAW US
[1:10:08] HEALED. HE SAW US DELIVERED. AND HE WENT
[1:10:10] FOR YOUR [screaming] JOY. OUR JOY. HE
[1:10:14] WENT FOR THAT REASON.
[1:10:16] AMEN.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; It was not about himself.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; It was about his body,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; his bride.
[1:10:26] Now, what a what a revelation of
[1:10:29] maturity. You see what maturity does
[1:10:32] when we talk about maturity? Maturity
[1:10:34] doesn't mean that we know more quotes
[1:10:36] than we used to know. Maturity doesn't
[1:10:39] mean that we can explain, oh, I can
[1:10:41] explain this doctrine. That's not
[1:10:42] maturity. But then those are a lot of
[1:10:44] things that people you can have
[1:10:46] knowledge uh and you listen I'm not
[1:10:48] saying that you shouldn't give yourself
[1:10:49] to know the word but remember maturity
[1:10:52] is about conduct
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; right
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; and behavior
[1:10:57] maturity is where with this molding and
[1:11:00] shaping of character through the
[1:11:02] yielding and and it's not something that
[1:11:05] is microwavable it's not something
[1:11:07] that's instant. not something that we
[1:11:09] can, you know, just type into chat GPT
[1:11:12] and say create an image on this and
[1:11:15] it'll
[1:11:17] it don't happen that way. But yet it's
[1:11:20] over throughout a lifetime. There's
[1:11:23] things that I realize right now as I
[1:11:25] stand here as 50 years old. I realize
[1:11:28] there's certain things even right now
[1:11:30] and I thought, Lord, I wish I would have
[1:11:32] seen this. And I'm talking about within
[1:11:36] me this certain victories and all these
[1:11:38] different victories and things that I've
[1:11:40] seen. And I was telling my wife the
[1:11:41] other day, I said there's certain things
[1:11:43] I said when I was fellowshipping with
[1:11:44] the brother. I got done ministering at
[1:11:46] one of the men's meetings and there's
[1:11:47] certain things I was fellowshipping
[1:11:48] about and my I just thought my how this
[1:11:50] is it's been something to me but just
[1:11:52] been so liberating. And I said little
[1:11:54] did I know I said it's just something
[1:11:56] that just continues to move in greater
[1:11:58] folds and folds and it goes deeper and
[1:12:00] deeper. And you know WHAT IT IS? IT'S
[1:12:02] actually showing up right here. It's
[1:12:05] showing up the weakness. IT'S SHOWING UP
[1:12:07] then the weakness and the hindrance. And
[1:12:09] actually what God wants is he's not
[1:12:11] going to strip THE WEAKNESS OUT, BUT GOD
[1:12:13] HAS A WAY TO BRING US into these places.
[1:12:16] And he absolutely helps us to see it.
[1:12:19] And I think not only does he help us to
[1:12:20] see it, but I'm so grateful he gives us
[1:12:22] the grace to yield our lives to him and
[1:12:25] say, "Yes, Lord. Your word is right,
[1:12:28] Lord. God, help me, Lord. Give me grace,
[1:12:30] Lord. Let it come forth, Lord, in my
[1:12:32] life. Let it be molded in my life. But
[1:12:34] yet, I realize that even of things that
[1:12:37] I know right now at 50 years old.
[1:12:41] These are things through experiences
[1:12:44] that you have to come through.
[1:12:47] And nobody could come through these
[1:12:48] experiences for me. Nobody could pass I
[1:12:52] couldn't pass through those things. you
[1:12:53] know, to think about who wouldn't want I
[1:12:55] mean, who wouldn't have wanted to wear
[1:12:57] experiences and molding and things that
[1:12:59] you've learned and so forth. Who
[1:13:01] wouldn't have wanted it, man, when I was
[1:13:03] 22 years old? I mean, who wouldn't have
[1:13:06] wanted 23 years ago when I started
[1:13:07] pastoring here? My goodness, with things
[1:13:09] that my I wish I would have I wish I
[1:13:12] would have known then, things that I
[1:13:13] know now. But it's all part of a
[1:13:16] journey,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; right? Right.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And that's not just with pastoring.
[1:13:19] That's the same way it is within your
[1:13:21] life. And you know what? It's never in a
[1:13:23] place to where you don't feel like well
[1:13:25] you don't it's not like you don't feel
[1:13:27] like you don't know anything or you feel
[1:13:29] like as though that well I I don't know
[1:13:31] but but you know God lets you and gives
[1:13:33] you grace and a confidence for the
[1:13:34] moment that you're in. So there then in
[1:13:37] your life as things God continues to
[1:13:39] mold and and to shape us and how that
[1:13:42] the word itself just molding and shaping
[1:13:45] our character because remember the
[1:13:47] biggest enemy we've got is ourselves.
[1:13:50] And so that has the molding and the
[1:13:52] shaping is going on within our lives.
[1:13:54] There's a great victory that's actually
[1:13:57] coming forth within our lives. And it's
[1:13:59] something that through this victory that
[1:14:01] we look at it that we couldn't just have
[1:14:03] passed through or just man jumped right
[1:14:05] over to this but it had to come through
[1:14:07] these places in order to absolutely die
[1:14:10] to oursel and where the Lord Jesus is
[1:14:13] standing some of the closing moments and
[1:14:15] this right here where he actually has
[1:14:18] such an understanding I've come from God
[1:14:21] going back to God and knowing knowing
[1:14:23] these things what a confidence it
[1:14:25] brought but how the confidence displayed
[1:14:28] itself self.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; It's always been so powerful to me when
[1:14:31] I read that in the scripture because he
[1:14:33] knowing you know many times a person if
[1:14:35] they feel like they know something then
[1:14:37] they feel like they can they know
[1:14:38] something more than somebody else and
[1:14:40] can subjugate this person or this or
[1:14:42] that. But that's not that's not of God.
[1:14:44] That's not what this maturity is. But
[1:14:46] this maturity it brought it even to a
[1:14:48] greater degree of looking out upon the
[1:14:50] needs of others. Now watch how this
[1:14:53] would come forth in Paul's own life and
[1:14:56] through the ministry. In Philippians
[1:14:57] chapter 1, Paul said, "I'm in straight
[1:15:00] betw twix to having a desire to depart
[1:15:03] and to be with Christ, which is far
[1:15:05] better. Nevertheless, to abide in the
[1:15:08] flesh is more needful for you. And
[1:15:12] having this confidence, I know that I
[1:15:15] shall abide and continue with you all
[1:15:17] for your furtherance
[1:15:20] and joy of faith that your rejoicing may
[1:15:24] be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me
[1:15:27] by my coming to you again.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Who was this about? If Paul got what he
[1:15:33] wanted, he wanted to go ahead and go on.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You remember when brother Brandham when
[1:15:38] he actually said, "Lord, I want to go
[1:15:39] ahead and go on.
[1:15:41] And the Lord spoke back to him and said,
[1:15:43] "Are you trying to bypass your trials?"
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And he asked, he told the Lord, he said,
[1:15:49] "Forgive me, Lord."
[1:15:53] Watch how Paul then would take this.
[1:15:54] What an example that would be laid. And
[1:15:56] he would say to us and to the sons of
[1:15:59] God there, do all things without
[1:16:02] murmurings
[1:16:03] and disputings.
[1:16:05] Now, murmurings and disputings are not
[1:16:07] necessarily anything that's done out
[1:16:09] loud. Yeah,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; a person can do something and yet
[1:16:13] inwardly they're grumbling about it.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; That's what this is. Grumbling, showing
[1:16:19] disavow or or dislike to it. They'll do
[1:16:23] it. But you see in doing it, remember
[1:16:26] that whole part about deposit
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; even if we do the right things. But if
[1:16:32] this is not right down here within it,
[1:16:35] it still does not register
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; right
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; as being deposited.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; We serve by love. Now why? that you
[1:16:45] might be blameless and harmless the sons
[1:16:47] of God without rebuke in the midst of a
[1:16:50] crooked and perverse nation among whom
[1:16:53] you shine as lights in the world holding
[1:16:55] forth the word of life that I may
[1:16:57] rejoice in the day of Christ that I may
[1:17:00] not run in vain neither labored in vain.
[1:17:02] Yay. And if I be offered upon the
[1:17:04] sacrifice and service of your faith, I
[1:17:08] joy and rejoice with you all for the
[1:17:11] same cause also you do joy and rejoice
[1:17:14] with me. Now if Paul is writing this by
[1:17:18] the spirit of God
[1:17:21] and if he inwardly is murmuring and
[1:17:24] complaining on why he has to preach
[1:17:26] certain things, deal with people, he's a
[1:17:29] hypocrite.
[1:17:32] But what Paul is pointing out right here
[1:17:35] of even of times if we can look at it
[1:17:38] and see it friends that these Paul,
[1:17:40] Peter, brother Brandham on and on were
[1:17:43] not men who like you and I would even be
[1:17:46] somehow exempt from having sometimes
[1:17:50] feelings of why this sometimes we can
[1:17:53] look at things and think well that's so
[1:17:55] elementary. But yet remember the prophet
[1:17:57] he had that in his ministry WHERE PEOPLE
[1:18:00] SAID WHY DON'T YOU TEACH THEM HOW TO
[1:18:01] RECEIVE SPIRITUAL GIFTS. BROTHER BRAM
[1:18:03] SAID, "HOW CAN I DO THAT WHEN THEY WON'T
[1:18:05] EVEN DO their ABCs?"
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Right? Sometimes how the enemy wants to
[1:18:09] just point out as, "Oh, these are little
[1:18:11] just minuscule things. These are men and
[1:18:14] but I'm but once again, if the word
[1:18:16] cannot be expressed in our life, the
[1:18:18] Bible, the the the message title, I love
[1:18:21] this. THE MESSAGE TITLE IS NOT GOD
[1:18:23] HIDING in simplicity." That's not the
[1:18:25] full title,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; right? The Bible says he hides in
[1:18:28] simplicity and then reveals himself
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; in the same.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; So God just doesn't deposit. It's not
[1:18:35] just a deposit, but yet it's alive to be
[1:18:39] expressed. Sure, how we appreciate the
[1:18:41] doctrines. We appreciate the truth of
[1:18:43] the word. That's the bark on the tree.
[1:18:45] We so appreciate that. But remember, the
[1:18:47] bark is not the only thing because if
[1:18:49] you have the bark without the life,
[1:18:50] pretty soon the bark will start falling
[1:18:52] apart. Notice how Paul would go on and
[1:18:55] write this. What an example. He said,
[1:18:57] "Now therefore we that not for that we
[1:19:00] have dominion over your faith, but are
[1:19:02] helpers of your joy, for by faith ye
[1:19:06] stand." If there's one thing, if I can
[1:19:08] just be known to be a helper of
[1:19:10] somebody's joy.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't that how that's what you want to
[1:19:13] know?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I want to be that. Don't you?
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
[1:19:17] THERE, BROTHER SAMUEL, I TELL YOU, HE'S
[1:19:19] THE greatest discourager.
[1:19:21] HE JUST KNOWS HOW TO CUT YOU DOWN TO THE
[1:19:24] FLOOR. HE JUST KNOWS friends listen you
[1:19:27] got to understand we see you can see
[1:19:30] needs you can see situations and
[1:19:32] sometimes depending on like I said
[1:19:34] sometimes individuals personalities can
[1:19:36] be and it can be this is where that they
[1:19:38] cannot use or they could but not use an
[1:19:41] occasion to the flesh to just simply say
[1:19:44] pow and get straight to the point
[1:19:46] instead of encourage somebody along the
[1:19:48] way
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; encourage them along the way help them
[1:19:52] along the way be helpers of their joy
[1:19:54] boy BE ENCOURAGING THEM EVEN in the
[1:19:57] small things LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE A
[1:19:58] BROTHER OR SISTER SEE SOMEBODY YOU AIN'T
[1:20:00] SEEN THEM IN WEEKS maybe months and they
[1:20:02] come in THE CHURCH DOOR GREET THEM
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; TELL THEM HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE
[1:20:07] THEM
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T YOU DON'T LOOK AT THEM AND SAY
[1:20:12] MAN WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU BEEN
[1:20:17] my lord where have YOU BEEN YOU KNOW
[1:20:20] BROTHERHAM SAID IF YOU GOT THE LOVE OF
[1:20:22] GOD THAT'S NOT THE PROPER PLACE.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THIS IS WHERE, FRIENDS, WE'VE
[1:20:27] GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE GIVING
[1:20:29] OUT IS NOT FRUSTRATION handling
[1:20:33] scriptures
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT EQUATES to no deposit.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; We're to be helpers
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; of their joy.
[1:20:46] Notice how Paul would say, "For we
[1:20:48] preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus
[1:20:50] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[1:20:54] Jesus' sake." I don't mind telling you
[1:20:57] there's certain times of things of how
[1:21:00] that when I would go and begin to
[1:21:01] minister on certain times. Sometimes
[1:21:03] it's happened even in meetings where
[1:21:05] I've had things and it's helpful that I
[1:21:07] found times where brother Brandham has
[1:21:08] talked about it, you know, as well. But
[1:21:10] you know, you you find it sometimes you
[1:21:12] feel so so you you feel like my
[1:21:14] goodness, what I'm getting ready to
[1:21:15] speak on is so and the devil said,
[1:21:17] "Yeah, that's so simple. That's just
[1:21:19] it's so I mean it's so minute." You say,
[1:21:21] "How do you know it's a devil?" I I
[1:21:23] listen I watch it and I'm watching and
[1:21:25] I'm looking and how the way things are
[1:21:27] GOING AND I FIND BROTHER Brandham over
[1:21:29] in Blind Barnameus. He said, "The devil
[1:21:30] like to wore me out all day long and
[1:21:34] told me
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; what the people were going to think."
[1:21:37] Cuz you see, here's what it is. how the
[1:21:39] devil will spin it. The people are going
[1:21:40] to think this. The people, oh, WE'RE
[1:21:42] WE'RE BEYOND THIS. BUT FRIENDS, there's
[1:21:44] a lot of times that there's things when
[1:21:46] I can when we look at it that I'm just
[1:21:48] going to I'm just going to say it like
[1:21:50] this. If this if this is the product of
[1:21:52] understanding deep mysteries, where
[1:21:54] there's more division than there ever
[1:21:56] has been, when there's more backbiting,
[1:21:59] when there's more looking down on one
[1:22:01] another, I don't believe that's a
[1:22:02] product of divine revelation. I can
[1:22:05] believe that that's a product of a lot
[1:22:06] of head knowledge but not divine
[1:22:08] revelation because divine revelation
[1:22:11] will produce humility in our lives.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So we don't we don't want
[1:22:17] that kind of a thing. BUT YOU KNOW I
[1:22:19] LOOK AT IT AND HOW that God would
[1:22:21] actually equip us within that to be
[1:22:23] servants ONE TO ANOTHER TO ACTUALLY
[1:22:26] MINISTER TO these things within our
[1:22:28] lives. I I'm grateful that God does
[1:22:30] that. I'm grateful that God will send
[1:22:32] men that are willing to be servants to
[1:22:35] his word, servants to him, and not try
[1:22:38] to be servants to the people. I don't
[1:22:39] want to I'm not interested in preaching
[1:22:41] something to make people shout, make
[1:22:43] them run. If if there's something that
[1:22:45] you know is given, I believe in the
[1:22:46] liberty of the word, BUT THIS IS NOT
[1:22:49] THAT'S NOT THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE the
[1:22:51] objective is is to be a help
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; to somebody. Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 12:15.
[1:23:01] And I will very gladly spend and be
[1:23:05] spent for you, though the more
[1:23:07] abundantly I love you, the less I be
[1:23:10] loved.
[1:23:12] Now you think about this scripture. Paul
[1:23:14] was giving of himself. And Paul was not
[1:23:18] in this scripture saying, "Now, I'm
[1:23:21] going to tell you, if there's now
[1:23:24] there's only 10 that's showing up. I
[1:23:27] think I'll just pull back on my study.
[1:23:31] Now there's only five.
[1:23:33] I'll just pull back. We'll just do a
[1:23:35] little little Bible study, read a real
[1:23:38] scripture, and pass around the mic.
[1:23:42] I'm just using an example that we could
[1:23:44] relate to." But you know what? Paul was
[1:23:46] saying the more the less though I more
[1:23:49] abundantly yet the less I be loved. You
[1:23:52] see your love our love the expression
[1:23:55] and I want to say the expression of
[1:23:57] divine love in our life should never be
[1:23:59] based on what's coming in return
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; because if it is it's not right. And yet
[1:24:07] sometimes can we get discouraged? Sure
[1:24:09] we can.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Can we we battle through that? Hey
[1:24:11] listen, brother Brandon battled through
[1:24:13] that. As a matter of fact, let me tell
[1:24:14] you the battle. I'm not going here
[1:24:15] tonight. But brother Bram, the battle he
[1:24:17] had is that it got to such a place that
[1:24:19] the more he was being spent and giving,
[1:24:22] the more he was saying, "Pin your pin
[1:24:23] your hair up. Brother Bam's coming to
[1:24:25] town. Do this and do that." It got to a
[1:24:27] place to where Brother Bram says, "Can
[1:24:28] you believe a person could get to a
[1:24:30] place that they would absolutely see a
[1:24:32] person going over the waterfall and
[1:24:34] laugh at it standing in the gap?"
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; He said, frankly, he said, "That's where
[1:24:40] I'm at this morning.
[1:24:44] I can follow a man like that.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; A man that's not always just putting but
[1:24:49] absolutely of what took place is the
[1:24:52] feeling for the people was lost.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; You see that's a danger when feeling
[1:24:58] gets lost. You go be going through the
[1:24:59] acts without any love within it.
[1:25:03] Remember Paul Raider? He he kissed his
[1:25:05] wife goodbye and he went out there and
[1:25:07] he heard her crying a little bit behind
[1:25:08] the door and he came in and he grabbed
[1:25:10] her and kissed her again and he said,
[1:25:13] "What was the difference?" He said, "The
[1:25:14] second one had feeling in
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; it."
[1:25:17] [laughter]
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; But it's it's truly, friends, it's a
[1:25:21] danger for all of us. It's and I realize
[1:25:23] for myself as a minister, it's it's a
[1:25:25] real it's a real danger. We can get to
[1:25:27] going through things and it just becomes
[1:25:29] service and those things like that. I'm
[1:25:31] just being honest with you. for myself
[1:25:32] when I look at that I've been you know
[1:25:34] privileged to sit around with brothers
[1:25:36] even from when I've taken took the
[1:25:37] pastorship and they would talk and I'll
[1:25:39] be honest with you there's certain
[1:25:40] things that they talked about at that
[1:25:41] time and mentioned to me I didn't I
[1:25:43] didn't even I didn't understand exactly
[1:25:45] what they were saying I've listened it's
[1:25:47] etched in my mind but then as I've come
[1:25:49] through different times and different
[1:25:51] things the Holy Spirit would bring that
[1:25:52] out you remember what so- and so said in
[1:25:54] your living room when you were there and
[1:25:56] he was there after the meetings you
[1:25:57] remember what this and that and I
[1:25:58] remember those things coming back but to
[1:26:00] remember at this I don't want I don't
[1:26:03] want to do something because it's just
[1:26:06] my duty
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; or service. that that's you know what
[1:26:11] that that kind of a state that's a
[1:26:12] dangerous state to be in
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; when something is just going but you
[1:26:16] know it's things that you know you say
[1:26:18] well brother Samuel how how do you how
[1:26:19] do you keep from that just continue to
[1:26:22] pray continue to look to God continue to
[1:26:25] seek the Lord and if there's things that
[1:26:27] I I feel like I need maybe to to rest a
[1:26:29] little bit that's what that's what I'll
[1:26:31] do within that and just really just
[1:26:33] because I want within my heart I want my
[1:26:35] heart to be tender
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; before God
[1:26:40] Now notice how Paul would write of this
[1:26:42] in first 1 Corinthians 9. Now let me go
[1:26:44] back. This is going back to 1
[1:26:45] Corinthians 9. Yet I have made though I
[1:26:49] be free from all men. In other words,
[1:26:50] I'm in liberty. Yet have I made myself
[1:26:55] servant unto all that I may gain the
[1:26:58] more. Now Paul goes into this how that
[1:27:01] he became to the Jews as a Jew. you
[1:27:05] know, he would be able Paul knew how to
[1:27:06] talk and put all that together and go
[1:27:08] through that and and he would do that.
[1:27:10] You find that in examples of the when he
[1:27:12] had the Pharisees and Sadducees and Paul
[1:27:14] Paul just spoke one thing and cut that
[1:27:16] whole audience in half. I believe in the
[1:27:19] resurrection OF THE DEAD AUTOMATICALLY
[1:27:20] PHARISEES LIKE, "GLORY TO GOD, THAT
[1:27:22] MAN'S ON OUR SIDE."
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [laughter]
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; It'd be like standing in the midst of a
[1:27:28] bunch of BAPTISTS AND PENTECOSTALS.
[1:27:29] GLORY TO GOD, I BELIEVE IN ETERNAL
[1:27:31] SECURITY. THE BAPTIST GOES, "AH, I think
[1:27:33] that guy's ONE OF US. GLORY TO GOD. I
[1:27:35] BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL GIFTS." THE
[1:27:36] PENTECOST SAY, "I THINK HE'S ONE OF US."
[1:27:38] That's why they asked Brother Brandon,
[1:27:40] "What in the world are you?" He said,
[1:27:41] "Well, that's easy.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; I can't remember the whole long thing."
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Pentecost on Nazarene Baptist.
[1:27:47] [laughter]
[1:27:51] But you WANT, LOOK, YOU'LL SEE THIS EVEN
[1:27:52] in Brother Bram's meetings. I don't know
[1:27:54] if you've paid attention this or not. I
[1:27:55] watch when brother Brandon will get it
[1:27:57] and we'll go come into certain meetings
[1:27:58] and things and you can catch how that
[1:28:00] even a lot of times when you'll watch a
[1:28:02] series of meetings how that brother
[1:28:04] Brandon will come about and you'll
[1:28:05] actually you'll find things ministering
[1:28:08] actually to the needs that are there. We
[1:28:09] know it's the spirit of God will lead
[1:28:11] it. But the prophet would absolutely
[1:28:13] have to be sensitive to that as well to
[1:28:16] allow the spirit of God to be able to
[1:28:18] move and to get the message across. And
[1:28:21] to think of how that, you know, Paul
[1:28:23] would say that as those that are without
[1:28:25] the law, I myself have become, you know,
[1:28:28] being not not without law to God, but
[1:28:30] under the law of Christ, that I may gain
[1:28:32] them that are without the law. In other
[1:28:34] words, when Paul was with the Jews, he
[1:28:36] he he wouldn't eat ribs.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; or pin down.
[1:28:44] BUT WHEN PAUL WAS WITH THE GENTILES,
[1:28:47] he said, "Bring me a slab, boys."
[1:28:50] Because he was free.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Right. He was free. SO, I'M USING JUST
[1:28:55] THAT WITH AN EXAMPLE THAT HE WASN'T IT
[1:28:57] WASN'T THAT PAUL was living a careless
[1:29:00] or reckless LIFE, BUT HE WAS EVERYTHING
[1:29:02] THAT HE WAS DOING, IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
[1:29:05] WITH, LET'S SAY, HOW much you like ribs
[1:29:06] or whatever more. IT HAD EVERYTHING TO
[1:29:09] DO WITH TRYING TO win that person's
[1:29:12] favor with the ultimate objective for
[1:29:15] the gospel's sake.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Brother, how long does that take?
[1:29:23] Sometimes the timeline's different for
[1:29:25] everybody.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you might work with somebody
[1:29:27] for 10 years.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Don't get impatient.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GOING TO DROP SERPENT SEED ON
[1:29:34] THEM. THEY MAY NOT be ready for that.
[1:29:37] Yes, Lord.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Well, JUST KEEP BEING A FRIEND TO THEM.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; KEEP LIVING THE LIFE. KEEP SHINING THE
[1:29:42] LIGHT ACROSS THEIR PATHWAY. EVEN YOUR
[1:29:44] LOVED ONES, THE DIFFERENT ONES AROUND
[1:29:46] US. KEEP SHINING THE LIGHT AND LIVING
[1:29:49] THE LIFE. THAT'S MORE POWERFUL THAN any
[1:29:53] knowledge.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I made all things to all men that I
[1:30:01] might by all means save some. Now,
[1:30:06] brother Brian picks this up in adoption
[1:30:09] [clears throat] part three and he talks
[1:30:11] about the scripture, "Father, I sanctify
[1:30:15] myself for their sake."
[1:30:18] Brother Brandham says, you know, that's
[1:30:19] one of the sweetest words that I ever
[1:30:22] heard. Father, I sanctify them for my
[1:30:25] sake. He said, did you know he had a
[1:30:28] right to have a home?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; He was a human.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; You know, he said he had a right to have
[1:30:33] a wife. He was a man. He had a right to
[1:30:36] all these things. But he said, 'Father,
[1:30:38] I sanctify myself for their sake. I
[1:30:41] sanctify myself. Bram said, I was
[1:30:44] talking to a little preacher yesterday.
[1:30:46] I'm going to preach for him in a few
[1:30:48] nights here on the highway, and I asked
[1:30:50] him about a certain thing, and he said,
[1:30:53] yes, brother Brandham, but the most of
[1:30:55] my people doesn't believe in that. I
[1:30:59] said, most of them are legalist.
[1:31:03] Yes.
[1:31:05] But the brother doesn't believe that.
[1:31:07] But he said, "For their sake."
[1:31:11] Brother says, "I wanted to hug his neck.
[1:31:14] For their sake, I sanctify myself for
[1:31:18] their sake." Now, I don't have there's
[1:31:21] no other statements within there when
[1:31:23] even throughout the times, the years
[1:31:25] I've looked at this in the message,
[1:31:28] but I have an idea where this where this
[1:31:29] church and who this this brother is when
[1:31:31] he talks about being out on the highway.
[1:31:35] And within this part of it when brother
[1:31:38] Brandham would ask this brother and say
[1:31:40] most of them are legalist. Yeah brother.
[1:31:44] Now this brother this pastor when him
[1:31:48] and brother Brandham are speaking about
[1:31:49] things
[1:31:51] it isn't that that church itself would
[1:31:53] never come into that place of really
[1:31:55] accepting the grace of God.
[1:31:58] But sometimes to go right in on things
[1:32:01] can actually cause more harm.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Everything has its time and its season.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I never forget I was the first one of
[1:32:10] the first times I was in the Philippines
[1:32:11] and I was sitting after we had come out
[1:32:14] of the convention and brother Pete he
[1:32:17] was uh brother Pete he's went on home to
[1:32:19] be with the Lord. I don't remember his
[1:32:20] last name but brother Pete, brother
[1:32:21] Roel, different ones. They were we were
[1:32:23] all sitting in our in the parsonage
[1:32:25] there. And uh when they first started
[1:32:28] doing the mystery expose and brother
[1:32:30] Pete was not only a pastor but he was a
[1:32:32] real high man I think in Assemblies of
[1:32:34] God and when brother Pete had accepted
[1:32:37] the message and this was you know one of
[1:32:39] the first mystery expose that was done.
[1:32:43] The one thing that they learned through
[1:32:45] that is when brother Pete accepted that
[1:32:48] he bl they blazed right into the church
[1:32:50] there and he began to preach it. And as
[1:32:53] soon as he began to preach it, I mean,
[1:32:57] everything broke loose. His house pulled
[1:32:59] from him.
[1:33:01] You know, the church because you most I
[1:33:03] don't know, probably a lot of you
[1:33:04] understand, but you know, there's things
[1:33:06] that when you understand, you ride by a
[1:33:07] lot of these denominational buildings.
[1:33:09] Do you know those people don't own that?
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Do you know that pastor, whoever the
[1:33:14] pastor is there, that that pastor serves
[1:33:17] there at the liberty of the
[1:33:18] headquarters? Yeah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And if headquarters sees we can that
[1:33:22] that church will move somebody else and
[1:33:24] we'll move people around. That's exactly
[1:33:26] what headquarters will do.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; And we've just had some experience with
[1:33:30] that in family and things like that and
[1:33:32] seeing those things firsthand. My dad
[1:33:34] always told me about it. But you know
[1:33:35] when you get to looking at it the thing
[1:33:37] that brother Pete Brother Pete had just
[1:33:39] a smile about him. You know he would
[1:33:41] smile and and brother Roel they said I
[1:33:43] tell you what we've learned a lot since
[1:33:44] the first time around. So after when we
[1:33:47] first go in there, when you know the
[1:33:49] pastors received it, we start to just
[1:33:51] drop little
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; by little by little in a congregation to
[1:33:56] to do what? Working to catch the elect
[1:33:59] that's in there.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And so you see there's things that we
[1:34:03] learn now. Would they would would
[1:34:04] brother Oel would brother Pete would
[1:34:06] they have given anything? Oh man, if I
[1:34:08] would have we would have known that the
[1:34:09] first go first couple of gorounds with
[1:34:11] the mystery expose and what would take
[1:34:13] place would they have done it
[1:34:14] differently? they would have. But what's
[1:34:16] important is is they learn from those
[1:34:18] things that were done right there.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; You know, when we begin to see this how
[1:34:23] that being made are made made as Paul
[1:34:26] said, I've been made all things to all
[1:34:27] men. Let me just try to wrap this up
[1:34:29] with this quote. Brother Bram goes on in
[1:34:31] that in what I'm referring to. Father, I
[1:34:33] sanctify myself for their for for their
[1:34:36] sake. He said Jesus was training 12 men
[1:34:39] that through those 12 men was to take
[1:34:42] the gospel to the world. And he said,
[1:34:45] "For their sake, I sanctify myself." In
[1:34:48] other words, make yourself for your
[1:34:51] neighbor's sake or for somebody else's
[1:34:53] sake. Don't use your liberty for a
[1:34:57] cloak, said Paul. But sanctify yourself.
[1:35:01] Behave yourself in the neighborhood like
[1:35:04] a real Christian ought to. If you meet
[1:35:07] your enemy, sanctify yourself for his
[1:35:10] sake,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; not knowing what you might do.
[1:35:15] So to make oursel, how how could you
[1:35:17] make yourself? It's not about making
[1:35:20] yourself as far as like, well, you're
[1:35:22] going to do this. It's about
[1:35:25] becoming
[1:35:28] that which is truth.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It's about when God begins to show these
[1:35:32] things to us and it begins to move upon
[1:35:35] our life. And then as we read here, make
[1:35:38] yourself for your neighbor's sake. In
[1:35:39] other words, to where that we become a
[1:35:43] servant
[1:35:45] for that person.
[1:35:48] Servant to be able to minister to their
[1:35:50] needs to make oursel for your neighbor's
[1:35:54] sake, for somebody else's sake. Don't
[1:35:56] use your liberty for a cloak, but
[1:35:58] sanctify yourself. I say, God, help me,
[1:36:02] Lord Jesus.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; If this is what the Lord Jesus himself
[1:36:07] when he took upon and dawned upon this
[1:36:10] of even not only the robe of humanity
[1:36:13] but he himself would gird himself with a
[1:36:16] towel and he would make himself
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; a footwash flunky.
[1:36:22] you know, to make yourself even to go
[1:36:24] beyond, you know, when you when even
[1:36:27] maybe witness to a family member and yet
[1:36:30] there there can be a lot of things that
[1:36:31] are, you know, going on within them and
[1:36:33] and so forth. And you can just, you
[1:36:35] know, Yeah. I mean, you could just, you
[1:36:37] know, get right to THE CHASE AND SAY,
[1:36:39] "YOU NEED TO BE BORN AGAIN." THEY DON'T
[1:36:40] have no clue what that means.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; And that's a really the last thing
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; they really need. It's not that they
[1:36:47] don't need to be born again, but what it
[1:36:50] is, they need Jesus
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; to be brought in contact of where
[1:36:53] they're at.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people need an ear. They need
[1:36:57] a they need that of a heart. They need
[1:36:59] things. And yet sometimes, WHAT IS IT?
[1:37:01] IT'S PRESSURES OF TIME. YEAH, WE WON'T
[1:37:02] SEE IT LIKE THAT. WE WE LOOK AT LIKE,
[1:37:04] WELL, I got all the time in the world.
[1:37:05] And and yet THEN WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO
[1:37:07] OTHER THINGS, WE will labor. Maybe we
[1:37:09] would build a building and we would
[1:37:10] labor. WE WOULD BE SO METICULOUS, MAN.
[1:37:13] WE'RE SO FINE ON HOW WE'RE DOING THIS
[1:37:15] CORNER AND HOW WE'RE DOING THIS. BUT YET
[1:37:17] WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING with somebody
[1:37:19] else, we would be so curt
[1:37:23] and so right on
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; that is so
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; in that manner instead of taking times
[1:37:28] where sometimes within even in things
[1:37:31] that we do I know even in things you
[1:37:33] know that we do around here when we're
[1:37:34] doing a project I got a lot of questions
[1:37:36] got a lot of things I reflect on a lot
[1:37:38] of things that go through my mind a lot
[1:37:40] and different things when we're looking
[1:37:41] at that and brothers we can talk about
[1:37:42] it there's a lot of things because when
[1:37:44] we want to do we want to do things that
[1:37:46] are that are done well.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; But how much more with souls?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; How much more with lives? How much more
[1:37:53] with the feelings of one another?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Make yourself for your neighbor's sake.
[1:38:01] And then they're at the bottom. If you
[1:38:02] meet your enemy,
[1:38:04] anybody got any enemies?
[1:38:08] [laughter]
[1:38:13] Here's what we do. sanctify yourself
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; for their sake. Clean out.
[1:38:21] Clean out.
[1:38:23] Not knowing what you might do. Oh,
[1:38:26] brother Samuel, if we've really got the
[1:38:27] whole No, no, no. Sanctify yourself not
[1:38:30] knowing what you might do.
[1:38:33] Keeping ourselves clean,
[1:38:37] separated.
[1:38:39] That's why Paul said, "Walk in the
[1:38:40] spirit
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; and you won't fulfill the lust, the lust
[1:38:44] of the flesh." Amen. Let's stand.
[1:38:50] I think how Paul and
[1:38:54] you know they
[1:38:56] Aquilla and Priscilla, they
[1:39:00] they worked with Apollos.
[1:39:04] I like how the Bible says because some
[1:39:05] sometimes the serving one another is
[1:39:09] ministering encouragement to one.
[1:39:13] Sometimes it's instructing or discipling
[1:39:15] one.
[1:39:17] Sometimes it's speaking the truth in
[1:39:19] love. Sometimes you just
[1:39:24] being honest with one another.
[1:39:27] Sometimes that can be pretty difficult.
[1:39:30] Now, I'm not talking about the opposite
[1:39:32] being a liar. But sometimes, you know
[1:39:33] how it is that there's times where you
[1:39:36] you really need to be honest with
[1:39:37] somebody.
[1:39:39] And sometimes it can be where you don't
[1:39:41] know exactly. You look at it, well,
[1:39:43] they're a friend or maybe you you have
[1:39:45] it's a time of being honest. You don't
[1:39:46] know. I don't know how they're going to
[1:39:48] respond to it. I don't know how they're
[1:39:49] going to act to it.
[1:39:52] So, it isn't that you're a liar, but you
[1:39:53] know, sometimes somebody can ask you
[1:39:55] something and how did you feel about
[1:39:57] this? How did you think about that? and
[1:39:59] you could just go right along with it.
[1:40:03] And sometimes we we take into account
[1:40:05] the situation and things, but yet then
[1:40:08] there's other times where
[1:40:10] God, help me to be honest.
[1:40:12] Help me just to be honest. Now, I'm not
[1:40:15] talking about always pulling out the
[1:40:16] revolver and just shooting them between
[1:40:18] the eyes.
[1:40:22] You know, the Bible talks about the
[1:40:24] blessedness of wounds above secret love.
[1:40:27] And how faithful are the wounds of a
[1:40:29] friend?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Because somebody who's always patting
[1:40:33] you on the back
[1:40:35] is not your friend.
[1:40:38] But a friend is one that will be honest
[1:40:40] with you. But in that honesty, a lot of
[1:40:44] times where a friend will do is they've
[1:40:46] prayed over it before they'll ever
[1:40:50] express it with the whole objective
[1:40:54] to not wanting to hurt or to offend.
[1:40:59] And yet, you know, every time that I
[1:41:01] ever got a spanking or got corrected or
[1:41:04] sometimes when they always called it
[1:41:06] when I was teaching, they called it
[1:41:08] constructive
[1:41:09] criticism.
[1:41:11] putting that nice beautiful term in
[1:41:13] front of criticism as though it's
[1:41:14] supposed to make you feel better,
[1:41:18] constructive, you know, it's beneficial.
[1:41:21] [laughter]
[1:41:23] And you know, they would always kind of
[1:41:25] teach you how to, you know, they teach
[1:41:26] you the things how that you know, one,
[1:41:28] two, three positives and then slip it
[1:41:31] in. You know, and there's things that
[1:41:33] and you know, in reality, you think, oh,
[1:41:34] that bunch of psychology. I can read you
[1:41:37] 1 Corinthians chapter 1.
[1:41:40] That same approach was taken where Paul
[1:41:43] commended the Corinthian church
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; for their position in Christ.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; A lot of times that's not mentioned. We
[1:41:50] think Ephesians, but Paul mentions in 1
[1:41:52] Corinthians chapter 1 mentioned that
[1:41:54] they came not behind in any spiritual
[1:41:56] gift. He gave such admonishment to him.
[1:41:59] And then like brother Bram says after
[1:42:01] about that he says he lowered the boom.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; But you think about how Aquilla and
[1:42:12] Priscilla they took Apollos
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; to the side and one of the things that
[1:42:17] they did was they discipled him. I I
[1:42:20] tell you, you know, I look forward to
[1:42:21] meeting Aquilla and Priscilla because
[1:42:25] in their lives to think of what they did
[1:42:27] to be able to see the need in Apollos's
[1:42:30] life and in his ministry and they were
[1:42:35] such a help
[1:42:37] to him
[1:42:39] in in in his walk and his journey to
[1:42:41] come fully all the way in. They got
[1:42:44] right with him and discipled him.
[1:42:48] So, that's so good.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; don't let me be so caught up in Samuel's
[1:42:56] world
[1:42:58] because I've got I've got my world. I've
[1:42:59] got my things. Like, I could go through
[1:43:01] and say, "Oh, you you don't understand
[1:43:03] this and understand that." I just be
[1:43:05] honest, friend. Sometimes when I when I
[1:43:07] hear, you know, sometimes where people
[1:43:08] say, "Oh, if people only understood what
[1:43:11] the ministry," I don't ever expect you
[1:43:13] to understand.
[1:43:16] My wife even in in in my home. She's
[1:43:19] right there with me serving with me. My
[1:43:21] boys are right there in the home. They
[1:43:23] they're not me. But you know, I don't
[1:43:26] expect them. I don't turn to them when
[1:43:28] things are going on or pressures. I
[1:43:29] don't let they don't they don't know
[1:43:31] that. They don't know that.
[1:43:34] But you know, with the things I don't
[1:43:36] expect I don't expect anybody oh to
[1:43:38] understand this or understand that. I
[1:43:40] don't expect that. That's not anything
[1:43:42] less. But I do but I do and I am
[1:43:45] thankful for this that we know that just
[1:43:48] as much as things that one is going
[1:43:50] through someone else is going through
[1:43:52] something as well.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; And we each are going through different
[1:43:56] things in our life.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; It's not about it's not some exclusive
[1:44:02] thing over here and that's I I just
[1:44:05] those are things that I don't I don't
[1:44:06] even care to hear. I just we want to be
[1:44:08] of a service
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; to the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:13] Let's just bow our heads in prayer.
[1:44:16] Heavenly Father, [sighs and gasps]
[1:44:19] Lord, I just dear God, I'm so thankful
[1:44:22] for your mercy, Lord, that you
[1:44:26] Lord, not only would bring a liberty in
[1:44:28] our hearts and our lives.
[1:44:31] And Lord, truly you have you you have
[1:44:34] really you've set us free.
[1:44:38] Lord, I'm so grateful for that.
[1:44:42] But I pray father that.
[1:44:46] I know Lord that you've forgiven me.
[1:44:50] There's no doubt Lord because I can
[1:44:52] speak not only for myself but for this
[1:44:54] congregation.
[1:44:57] Sometimes the Lord just unaware where
[1:45:00] we've
[1:45:02] used liberty for an occasion to the
[1:45:04] flesh.
[1:45:06] Sometimes, Lord, it's been
[1:45:09] ways and things, Lord. It isn't always
[1:45:12] the same for everybody.
[1:45:16] But I'm asking you, Lord,
[1:45:19] may we, each one of us, Lord, help us to
[1:45:21] take it and to be sensitive.
[1:45:25] If there ever was a time, Lord, in an
[1:45:27] hour, I find how your profit over and
[1:45:30] over and over again,
[1:45:34] admonishing us
[1:45:36] how we are to love one another.
[1:45:40] What I heard him say just yesterday
[1:45:43] and true sign overlooked
[1:45:46] and it came back up to the pullpit.
[1:45:48] He said that love that is should be
[1:45:51] between us as brothers and sisters if we
[1:45:53] ever loved one another.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; This ought to be the time he said it
[1:45:56] ought to be something greater
[1:45:59] than that of even what would be in blood
[1:46:02] related brothers and sisters.
[1:46:07] Oh Lord Jesus,
[1:46:09] help us. Lord,
[1:46:13] help us. Father, help me.
[1:46:16] Help me, Lord. Not only as a pastor, but
[1:46:18] help me as a brother.
[1:46:21] Help me, Lord. Help me to be sensitive,
[1:46:24] Lord.
[1:46:26] Help me to be sensitive, Lord. I always,
[1:46:28] you know, my heart's desire. I want to
[1:46:30] be sensitive to follow you. I want to be
[1:46:33] sensitive, Lord, to not only just to be
[1:46:36] sensitive on what to minister and what
[1:46:38] to bring, Lord, to your children,
[1:46:42] whether it's here, Lord, at home or
[1:46:45] places, Lord, where you would have me to
[1:46:47] go.
[1:46:51] I don't just limit it, Lord, to
[1:46:53] preaching,
[1:46:57] but help me to be of a service
[1:47:01] to the body.
[1:47:06] Lord God,
[1:47:08] even many times, Lord, when I'd go into
[1:47:11] places,
[1:47:14] talk to some Lord of the people and
[1:47:15] they're were helping me out at the meat
[1:47:17] counter and cutting meat in a certain
[1:47:19] slice or a certain way
[1:47:23] and I just just say something, Lord, to
[1:47:25] them. We get to talk and they begin to
[1:47:28] smile.
[1:47:33] It just
[1:47:36] I'm so thankful, Lord, because I know
[1:47:37] the burdens, the pressure of this day.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; It's all around.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:47:47] help us.
[1:47:49] I don't want just something to be
[1:47:50] exclusive, Lord, to where it's just the
[1:47:53] only thing I can do is be of a service
[1:47:57] to the body of Jesus Christ. That's what
[1:47:59] I want. I want to be I want to be that
[1:48:01] Lord. If it's holding the door for
[1:48:03] somebody
[1:48:05] that ain't just somebody, Lord, who
[1:48:06] stands and holds the door,
[1:48:09] but it's about seeing a need.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, Lord, the simplest things
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; we could step over.
[1:48:19] Maybe it's a cough drop wrapper. Maybe
[1:48:20] it's a tissue. Oh, the janitor will get
[1:48:23] that. But what if I see it?
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; That's so good. God, help me that I'll
[1:48:28] never be too big that I couldn't pick up
[1:48:29] a cough drop wrapper.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; This is your house.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; This is our place.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And I pray to God, don't let me be
[1:48:40] grumbling and murmuring in my heart.
[1:48:44] Why couldn't that lazy thing have thrown
[1:48:46] this in the trash can,
[1:48:49] oh God,
[1:48:52] it renders zero deposit
[1:48:55] when it's done with murmurings and
[1:48:57] disputes.
[1:49:00] Help us, Lord.
[1:49:04] Help us, Lord.
[1:49:07] Dear God, I pray that I know it's very
[1:49:10] simple,
[1:49:13] but help us, Lord. Surely, if you're
[1:49:16] leading upon this, Lord, and would place
[1:49:18] these things upon my heart to minister,
[1:49:22] you're calling us
[1:49:25] to a higher a higher calling, a higher
[1:49:28] walk.
[1:49:32] Help us, Lord.
[1:49:36] Help us Jesus.
[1:49:40] Help us Lord.
[1:49:42] Help us Lord to serve one another
[1:49:46] with love.
[1:49:48] Help us Lord that brother, that sister,
[1:49:52] Lord God, like we said, maybe one that
[1:49:54] we haven't seen in a while. Maybe Lord
[1:49:55] that even before then
[1:49:59] just Lord sometimes even a text a card
[1:50:03] how those little things Lord it means so
[1:50:05] much
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; you know Lord here
[1:50:10] on Sat last Saturday evening
[1:50:13] I went to the mailbox
[1:50:18] there was one Lord that had sent me a
[1:50:20] card
[1:50:24] and They had wrote Lord in them that
[1:50:26] card
[1:50:28] of how they have watched their life
[1:50:31] being changed
[1:50:33] being made more and more like you and
[1:50:35] how they had seen such victory in their
[1:50:37] life. Lord God
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; What encouragement that was.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Brought tears to my eyes.
[1:50:51] Brought joy to my heart. Lord
[1:50:54] because that's the whole desire.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I want to see Lord hearts and lives just
[1:51:01] Lord to seeing just that growth that's
[1:51:03] that victory just that joy Lord that
[1:51:06] being experienced in their life that's
[1:51:08] that's worth it all.
[1:51:10] Thank you Lord. Thank you Father. Thank
[1:51:13] you for being mindful.
[1:51:16] Thank you Lord God. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:51:18] moving, Lord, to where that would even
[1:51:20] be pinned and dropped in the mail, Lord
[1:51:22] God. Thank you for that, Lord.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; That was from you. Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:31] I pray, heavenly father,
[1:51:34] help each and every one of us, Lord.
[1:51:38] [music]
[1:51:38] Lord, we're living in an hour our phones
[1:51:40] get blowed up with discouraging news.
[1:51:44] If we're tied in, Lord, to any sort of
[1:51:46] news or anything at all. Oh my goodness,
[1:51:48] Lord, there's things all around us.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; I always think how brother John
[1:51:54] Lefontaine would kind of joke around
[1:51:56] with the weather. He said, "Why can't
[1:51:58] they say partly sunny, instead they say
[1:52:00] partly cloudy."
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:52:06] Things that just so there's so much
[1:52:09] negative. Help us. I don't believe God
[1:52:12] that in this hour that you
[1:52:16] you've led us to a place of defeat.
[1:52:20] No.
[1:52:22] But in an hour where there's hatred
[1:52:25] has reached to such an apex
[1:52:30] or we see people shooting one another
[1:52:33] because they disagree.
[1:52:36] If it can reach to that place, then it
[1:52:39] shows Lord in the contrast
[1:52:42] where love is to have its way.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; If you wanted us all to think the same,
[1:52:51] you would do that, Lord.
[1:52:55] As I've said for weeks, months now, it's
[1:52:58] amazing how your prophet will describe
[1:53:01] it to where we will come to the marriage
[1:53:04] supper of the lamb
[1:53:07] and [music] then all differences
[1:53:10] will fade.
[1:53:12] They actually fade away at the change of
[1:53:14] the body.
[1:53:18] But you would let that remain.
[1:53:21] our certain feelings about something,
[1:53:23] our thoughts about something, you would
[1:53:25] let that remain
[1:53:27] all the way through
[1:53:30] to prove that divine love is greater
[1:53:34] than any opinion, any thought, any
[1:53:38] feeling, any difference.
[1:53:42] What victory in love divine?
[1:53:46] Help us Lord.
[1:53:49] Help us to be mindful in serving one
[1:53:52] another.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. I pray
[1:53:58] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:01] Amen.
[1:54:13] [music and singing]
[1:54:13] Oh, I
[1:54:17] want to [music] be more like you.
[1:54:25] I want to [music and singing] be a
[1:54:26] vessel you work through.
[1:54:30] I
[1:54:32] want to [singing] be more like you.
[1:54:35] [music]
[1:54:40] [music]
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Want to be more like you,
[1:54:48] Jesus.
[1:54:51] I [singing]
[1:54:54] want to be more like you.
[1:55:00] Oh, I [singing]
[1:55:02] want to be a vessel you work through.
[1:55:06] for I
[1:55:10] want to be [singing] more like you.
[1:55:17] [singing]
[1:55:20] Want to be more like you, [music]
[1:55:26] Jesus.
[1:55:28] I
[1:55:31] want to be more [singing] like you.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be a vessel of you.
[1:55:43] For I
[1:55:46] want to be [music and singing] more like
[1:55:49] you.
[1:55:53] Take me deeper. [music]
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:01] with you,
[1:56:05] Jesus. [music]
[1:56:05] Hold [singing] me close in your embrace.
[1:56:11] [singing]
[1:56:12] [music]
[1:56:13] Take me deeper.
[1:56:19] [music]
[1:56:23] I just want to love you [music] more and
[1:56:26] more. Oh, how long
[1:56:32] [music]
[1:56:36] [singing]
[1:56:37] is it?
[1:56:40] You know, sometimes when we're
[1:56:42] discipling and instructing,
[1:56:46] sometimes you don't even know. I think
[1:56:48] there's different times that I've been
[1:56:49] ministering, you don't even know.
[1:56:52] But I told you about even when the time
[1:56:54] here I was just up there at brother John
[1:56:55] Andy's and in that service that morning
[1:57:00] what I was studying on that morning and
[1:57:02] looking at I was so set. I thought the
[1:57:04] inspiration this this is where I'm going
[1:57:06] where we're going today.
[1:57:10] And when I went over and was a brother
[1:57:12] came in and I shook that brother's hand,
[1:57:15] began to speak to him.
[1:57:18] And it was a brother whose grandson his
[1:57:21] life had just been taken.
[1:57:24] And as soon as I shook his hand and
[1:57:26] began to talk to him, I felt something
[1:57:28] switch.
[1:57:32] First thing you do, Lord, is it just is
[1:57:34] that me?
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; I didn't feel the same in way I felt
[1:57:37] inspired about everything before.
[1:57:42] I went out there in that service and
[1:57:46] read some scriptures and then the Lord
[1:57:48] just the Lord took it and I told you
[1:57:50] here the Lord told me he said just
[1:57:52] follow me
[1:57:54] in that service I went through in my
[1:57:57] testimony that's what started coming out
[1:58:01] also coming out different needs of how
[1:58:03] tragedy could strike within a church
[1:58:06] tragedy of young ones
[1:58:09] And then our response after tragedy
[1:58:11] strikes, where do we turn to,
[1:58:15] what what do we give ourselves to,
[1:58:18] you know, within that part of it?
[1:58:22] Sometimes when you're speaking to
[1:58:24] individuals, you know, there was an
[1:58:25] individual right there, and I think I
[1:58:26] told you this. These are some some some
[1:58:28] of these people had never even darkened
[1:58:31] a church door at all. They were friends
[1:58:33] of this person.
[1:58:35] certain terminologies they never would
[1:58:37] have understood
[1:58:41] here in the midst of a ministering
[1:58:42] brother Steve Clar the associate I
[1:58:46] didn't catch it but he said brother
[1:58:47] Samuel said that I don't know if you
[1:58:48] caught this or not he said but as you
[1:58:50] were speaking he said when that one
[1:58:51] young man got up he said and he walked
[1:58:53] out he said he was out there standing in
[1:58:56] the parking lot he said I walked over to
[1:58:58] him and said it's pretty heavy isn't it
[1:59:01] he said oh my
[1:59:04] he said Brother Samuel, he said, "Right
[1:59:05] out there in the parking lot," he said,
[1:59:08] "I led him to the Lord."
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music]
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "We got right down in that
[1:59:12] parking lot and I led him to the Lord."
[1:59:16] I say all that in this. You've got a
[1:59:18] testimony.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Just tell somebody how your candle got
[1:59:23] lit. Just tell them your testimony. That
[1:59:26] that in itself will have an impact as
[1:59:28] God would lead you. Just just minister
[1:59:30] to them. Just like as a person one time
[1:59:33] that I was standing in Panera and this
[1:59:36] guy, you know, he he went to go get that
[1:59:39] hazelnut coffee and I don't I don't go
[1:59:40] to Panera for coffee, but one time, you
[1:59:42] know, I I did and I was looking at it
[1:59:44] and I said he said, "Man," he said, "I
[1:59:46] sure would like to have, you know," and
[1:59:47] he named off something. I said I said,
[1:59:50] "You know what? God set me free of
[1:59:51] that." He set the coffee cup down and he
[1:59:54] turned around and looked at me. He said,
[1:59:55] "What did you say?" I said, "God set me
[1:59:58] free of that." I'm not talking about
[2:00:00] Panera coffee. I'm talking about the the
[2:00:02] drink he was talking about. I said, "God
[2:00:04] set me free of that." Then he he started
[2:00:06] talking to me. He started asking me and
[2:00:09] the moment as we started talking, I can
[2:00:11] tell you right there in the how that
[2:00:12] paner was set up, the prince of God came
[2:00:14] down in such a way that man, that man
[2:00:16] didn't even know what to do. He ran off
[2:00:18] and left his book. I had to take his
[2:00:20] book and chase him out to his car.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; But the presence of God came down.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; In such a way, but you know what it was?
[2:00:30] just just testifying just just letting
[2:00:32] him know just what God has done for you.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Just a sharing that that's an impact,
[2:00:38] friends. Your life's a testimony.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. May God be
[2:00:45] with you. Amen. God with you as we go
[2:00:48] our separate ways. Remember, Brother
[2:00:50] Josh Martin, he'll be here, Lord
[2:00:52] willing, on Sunday and ministering for
[2:00:54] us. And so we just want to just pray and
[2:00:58] just be ready for that and ask the Lord
[2:01:00] just to speak to us. Remember one
[2:01:01] another in prayer.
[2:01:04] Oh, how I long
[2:01:08] to be deeper
[2:01:10] in love.
[2:01:12] [music] Amen. God bless you. Take
[2:01:15] [singing] me deeper
[2:01:19] even
[2:01:22] with you. [singing]
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus, hold me close in your embrace.
[2:01:33] Lord, take me [music] deeper,
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; deeper than I ever.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.

[2:01:45] [music and singing] more and more.
[2:01:48] How I

[2:02:28] more.

[2:02:32] to be deeper

[2:02:44] love
[2:02:46] with you,
[2:02:49] [music] Jesus. Hold [singing] me close.
[2:02:53] Your embrace.

[2:03:10] more and more. How I long [singing]

[2:03:22] you more and more and more. How I long
[2:03:28] to be deeper
[2:03:31] love
[2:03:33] than
[2:03:35] this little light of [singing] mine.
