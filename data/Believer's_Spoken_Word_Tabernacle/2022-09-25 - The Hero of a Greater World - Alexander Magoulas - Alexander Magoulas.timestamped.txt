[37:50] this time our lives our hearts into your
[37:52] hands in the name of our Lord and Savior
[37:54] Jesus Christ the bride says amen God
[37:58] bless you very very good to be with you
[38:01] today I'm just uh I'm very privileged
[38:03] you can be seated for just a moment if
[38:05] you'd like
[38:07] um we just are very privileged to be
[38:09] with you I know I had some people ask me
[38:11] already so I thought I would just take a
[38:14] few moments and
[38:15] give a little testimony about what's
[38:18] been going on in my life and and uh and
[38:20] things
[38:21] um some of you may remember here clear
[38:24] back I think it was 2018 I ministered
[38:25] here and about a week or two later I
[38:27] went in I had real bad pneumonia I put
[38:29] off going to the doctor for about a
[38:30] month and about killed me so I've
[38:32] learned to try to be a little more uh
[38:34] careful
[38:35] about those things because you know
[38:37] sometimes in our lives and maybe this
[38:39] will help somebody too sometimes in our
[38:40] lives we think man I don't even have
[38:42] time to be sick
[38:43] we get so busy and it seems that way but
[38:46] you know what I didn't have time to be
[38:47] in the hospital for eight or nine days
[38:48] either so I I started having some issues
[38:51] here back uh back in June and I was just
[38:54] getting really kind of short of breath
[38:56] and I'd have pain in my left arm it
[38:58] would kind of come and go at first and
[39:00] then it would kind of not go so fast and
[39:02] then eventually my ears started had
[39:04] chest pain and so my blood pressure at
[39:06] one point was almost 180 over 100 it was
[39:09] really bad so uh
[39:11] you know I I went and got checked out
[39:13] and to make a long story short they went
[39:15] and did a heart catheterization and my
[39:17] main my main arter was 99.99 I don't you
[39:20] know I'm not a mathematician I guess but
[39:22] it was completely blocked they showed me
[39:23] a little video they're like see see this
[39:25] line here and how it just kind of stops
[39:27] I'm like yeah it's not supposed to do
[39:28] that they said wow so they put a stent
[39:32] in there my the second one was 70 block
[39:34] so
[39:35] um you know it's interesting to me
[39:37] because uh um
[39:38] you know I can be kind of stubborn
[39:40] sometimes I prefer perseverance because
[39:43] it's for the Lord but I'm the type of
[39:45] person you know and and this is just me
[39:47] I'm not saying this for everybody but uh
[39:50] you know I when I when I had that
[39:51] surgery a few years ago you know I was
[39:53] out preaching the next day and people
[39:54] were like man you're nuts
[39:56] but you know what I just I know what
[39:59] God's done my life and I know what he's
[40:01] called me to and uh uh you know I've
[40:04] tried to do other things I've tried to
[40:05] run from but I can't find myself doing
[40:07] anything else but preaching the gospel
[40:09] and this message and so I just had the
[40:12] last procedure this Monday and I'm happy
[40:13] to be here with you in defiance of the
[40:15] devil and Defiance of the world and
[40:18] everything that would try to beset me
[40:19] I'm here today and on behalf of the Lord
[40:21] and Savior Jesus Christ in whom we serve
[40:23] and I'm thankful there's times you know
[40:25] there was times I was in the Pulpit here
[40:27] about last month man I I was preaching
[40:30] man I thought my heart was gonna all
[40:31] sudden it just start hurting real bad
[40:33] never hurt that bad before and I thought
[40:35] well if I'm gonna die I guess I'll die
[40:37] preaching this message
[40:40] you know what what better way could I go
[40:42] out you know
[40:43] and there's that guy who just preached
[40:45] till he dropped dead well praise the
[40:46] Lord that's better than being a coward I
[40:48] guess and so you know not that you're
[40:50] coward to be sick and stay home I'm
[40:52] saying but for me I'm just like you know
[40:53] what I wouldn't let fear seize upon that
[40:55] moment I said I'm just going to preach
[40:57] anyhow and so we're here today and and
[40:59] listen that's my testimony but we all
[41:01] come through things
[41:02] we've all dealt with things and maybe
[41:04] it's not the same as mine maybe it's
[41:05] worse I don't know we're not we're not
[41:07] here today to compare but we are here
[41:09] today to remember that greater is he he
[41:11] can take you through it amen for by
[41:13] every medical account especially the way
[41:15] I get to preaching sometimes one of the
[41:17] nurses said I should play the lottery
[41:18] and I thought well I I I'm not really
[41:21] that type of person but it's a miracle
[41:23] you're alive and I thought that's
[41:24] exactly the truth it's been a miracle
[41:27] I've been alive for the last 16 years I
[41:29] should have died 16 years ago and so the
[41:31] Lord just seemed fit to keep me here and
[41:33] who am I to contend with the Lord
[41:37] and some of you are here today maybe you
[41:39] wish to go on and you know that's
[41:41] understandable Paul wanted to go on one
[41:43] time but Paul said you know it's needful
[41:45] for me to be here and I believe it's
[41:46] needful for each one of us to be here
[41:48] today God's got a purpose in it God's
[41:51] got a purpose in your life
[41:53] not just me the preacher God's got a
[41:54] purpose in each of your lives and you're
[41:56] here today for a reason and I want you
[41:58] to really just meditate on that as we
[42:00] Minister today because I don't want us
[42:02] to it's so easy to lose sight of that
[42:04] and I hope you don't have to have a
[42:06] brush with death to remember that our
[42:09] lives here are it's like a vapor but yet
[42:11] God can do things in our life that are
[42:13] so great and so beyond our own thinking
[42:16] that things that you could never imagine
[42:18] that you could do God can do in your
[42:19] life
[42:21] amen God bless you if you stand with me
[42:23] once more this morning we'll look into
[42:25] the book of Nehemiah
[42:27] we're gonna look at Nehemiah the fourth
[42:29] chapter
[42:30] um I like the book of Nehemiah some of
[42:32] you may surmise that based on the fact
[42:34] that my oldest son's name Nehemiah so I
[42:37] do like the book of name I like them all
[42:39] but I really like Nehemiah it's not
[42:40] something it's preached on a lot but I
[42:42] love nehemiah's stand for the word and
[42:44] it's so many of the things that the
[42:46] scripture has here and I invite you to
[42:49] read with me this morning in Nehemiah
[42:50] the fourth chapter we'll start in verses
[42:52] we'll start in verse 12.
[42:54] and I'll read down to verse 20 and I'll
[42:56] have you be seated
[42:58] Nehemiah chapter 4 verse 12 says this
[43:01] and it came to pass that when the Jews
[43:04] which dwelt by them came they said unto
[43:06] us ten times from all places when she
[43:09] shall return unto us they will be upon
[43:12] they will be upon you not for some
[43:14] context here before I read a little
[43:15] further they have begun to rebuild this
[43:17] wall and there's some there's some
[43:19] adversaries they don't want the wall
[43:20] rebuilt amen now the temple has already
[43:23] been restored the worship the word has a
[43:25] restoration but there's some homes
[43:27] around this message there's some homes
[43:30] around this world that need some
[43:31] restoration still amen there's some
[43:33] people that their lives need to be
[43:35] rebuilt around this Temple this worship
[43:37] and so they begin to rebuild this and
[43:39] they get worn by by these different Jews
[43:41] there's opposition has arisen and a lot
[43:45] of people would say well I guess there's
[43:46] no point in building the wall but the
[43:48] point of building the wall is because
[43:49] there's opposition in the first place
[43:51] amen praise the Lord verse 13 He says
[43:55] therefore set out in the lower places
[43:56] behind the wall and on the higher places
[43:59] I even set the people after their
[44:00] families with their swords their Spears
[44:03] and their bows and I looked and Rose up
[44:06] and said unto the Nobles and to the
[44:09] rulers and to the rest of the people be
[44:12] not ye afraid of them remember the Lord
[44:16] amen remember the Lord which is great
[44:19] and terrible and fight for your brethren
[44:22] your sons and your daughters your wives
[44:26] and your houses and it came to pass when
[44:29] our enemies heard that it was known unto
[44:31] us and God had brought their counsel to
[44:34] not that we returned all of us to the
[44:36] wall everyone into his work and it came
[44:39] to pass from that time forth that the
[44:41] half of my servants wrought in the work
[44:43] and the other half of them held both the
[44:46] spears the Shields and the bows and the
[44:49] habergens and the rulers were behind all
[44:52] the house of Judah they which build it
[44:55] on the wall and they that bear burdens
[44:58] with those that laid it everyone with
[45:01] one of his hands brought in the work and
[45:03] with the other hand held a weapon for
[45:05] the builders everyone had his sword
[45:07] girded by his side and so builded and he
[45:11] that sounded the trumpet was by me oh
[45:14] this is really interesting this guy this
[45:16] guy with a trumpet and I said unto the
[45:18] Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest
[45:19] of the people the work is great and
[45:22] large and we are separated upon the wall
[45:25] far from one one far from another
[45:28] in what place therefore in other words
[45:30] because we're all spread out doing this
[45:32] work and what place is therefore you
[45:35] hear the sound of the trumpet Resort the
[45:37] thither unto us our God shall fight for
[45:42] us
[45:43] amen you believe that today and the Lord
[45:46] blessed the reading of his word you may
[45:48] be seated
[45:49] I'd like to take a thought this morning
[45:51] it's uh it's actually a series I started
[45:53] a couple other places it's the first
[45:54] part uh it's called the hero of a
[45:58] greater world the hero of a greater
[46:00] world and uh to to give you some context
[46:03] for this uh I was on a mission trip
[46:05] several years back here in India one of
[46:07] the trips I've taken over there I was
[46:09] staying in a certain place I I don't
[46:10] remember which one I think maybe it was
[46:12] Roger mundry but that's neither here nor
[46:13] there to most of us anyway but I was
[46:16] staying in this hotel and uh a lot of
[46:18] the hotels over there that have the
[46:19] restaurants built in nearby are in it
[46:21] because of the way that the
[46:22] infrastructure is there and so I got up
[46:25] one morning and I had gotten ready and
[46:26] getting ready to go to the service and
[46:27] they were going to take me to breakfast
[46:29] and so I'm out walking from the through
[46:32] the courtyard from where my room was to
[46:35] where I was taking the breakfast and I
[46:37] noticed there were several different
[46:38] pillars outside and they had busts
[46:40] they're just black busts of different
[46:42] people on top of each one and I saw you
[46:45] know this this famous British guy that
[46:46] was there during the time that the
[46:48] British had been there and they had
[46:49] several different people and I'm saying
[46:52] this for a reason now I'm going along
[46:53] and I see a bust of Abraham Lincoln the
[46:56] 16th president of the United States
[46:58] right there in the middle of India and I
[47:00] thought it was remarkable to me that
[47:01] here's Abraham Lincoln in the midst of
[47:03] India I didn't expect to see him there
[47:06] or a likeness of his I mean he wasn't
[47:08] there but uh didn't expect to see that
[47:10] there and so I asked the brother I said
[47:12] brother I'm just kind of curious why why
[47:15] is there this statue of Abraham Lincoln
[47:17] here and he began to tell me about the
[47:19] 16th president of the United States and
[47:20] how he grew he told me all these things
[47:22] I'm thinking man most of these kids
[47:23] nowadays don't even know this in America
[47:26] they don't know nothing about Abraham
[47:27] Lincoln but he was talking about how you
[47:29] know he fought and they ended slavery
[47:30] and American what a great man he was he
[47:32] was talking about
[47:34] he said here in India we consider him a
[47:36] hero I know that's amazing because like
[47:39] I said again a lot of people don't even
[47:40] know who he is nowadays but they they
[47:42] here I am staring at the 16th president
[47:44] United States and in the middle of the
[47:46] other side of the world and he was
[47:47] telling me what an inspiration his
[47:49] leadership and his vision his character
[47:52] to the people of India much more than
[47:54] maybe some Americans and so I'm not I'm
[47:56] not I'm not saying that to be whatever I
[47:58] mean you know nowadays A lot of them
[47:59] don't know who we declare our
[48:00] independence from or different things
[48:02] like that I mean they have no idea amen
[48:04] I mean they call certain people Hitler
[48:06] and they can't even tell you when Hitler
[48:08] was alive I mean it's just interesting
[48:10] how people they throw these labels out
[48:11] but here in India this man Abraham
[48:14] Lincoln is regarded as a hero to the
[48:17] people of India and so it got me to
[48:19] thinking what is it that makes a man or
[48:21] a woman what makes him a hero what what
[48:23] defines a person as a hero and brother
[48:26] Brown says many things in the message
[48:27] about heroism it's kind of interesting
[48:29] when you go back and he talks about it
[48:30] quite a bit and so you know I begin to
[48:33] think what is it makes somebody a hero
[48:35] and the first thing that come to my mind
[48:36] or maybe a lot of of us is is there
[48:39] courage or their bravery and that's
[48:42] certainly a part of it but history is
[48:44] replete with examples of of people that
[48:46] were Brave they were bold because they
[48:48] were just dumb
[48:50] they were just too foolish to recognize
[48:52] the danger and they blundered into
[48:54] something so it's not courage in and of
[48:56] itself because there's plenty of people
[48:57] they're courageous but they're they die
[49:00] as fools for vainglory or whatever it is
[49:02] and it's not just that a man or a woman
[49:04] has a certain kind of a talent
[49:06] because there's plenty of people in the
[49:07] world they they waste their talents they
[49:10] bury their talents they misuse their
[49:12] talents they're afraid to employ their
[49:13] talents it's not that a person's just
[49:15] famous or that their deeds are known
[49:17] because there's many people that are
[49:19] well known and they're they're not
[49:20] heroic at all and it's interesting
[49:22] because when you look at the the Eastern
[49:24] culture in India and China especially
[49:25] their idea of a hero it extends just
[49:28] beyond their their their their more
[49:30] afforded to but there's somebody Whose
[49:32] actions have changed the natural order
[49:35] of things in the world
[49:37] their designs and what they have done is
[49:39] change the way that we do things or the
[49:41] way we look at things or the way that
[49:43] things are carried out and I thought you
[49:44] know that's a that's a really good one
[49:46] they look at a social reformer or
[49:47] somebody as a hero and so I say all
[49:50] these things and I look at all these
[49:52] things and to me what really makes the
[49:54] distinction of someone as a hero is not
[49:57] just they have virtue but it's their
[49:58] uncommon virtue or moral fortitude amen
[50:03] because a person of of strong moral
[50:05] conviction they endure exceptional
[50:07] hazards because at least to them it's
[50:09] the ethical of the right thing to do
[50:11] amen so I want you to understand it's
[50:13] not just a person that endures danger
[50:16] they put themselves in danger they put
[50:19] themselves In Harm's Way because the
[50:22] purpose that they are trying to fulfill
[50:24] is greater and I'm saying this for a
[50:27] reason we live in an era of modern
[50:28] entertainment and we're constantly the
[50:31] people are trying to redefine what a
[50:32] hero is you've got some guy with these
[50:35] big muscles of course he's got you know
[50:36] thousands of dollars of trainers a week
[50:38] and he's in a movie and he's got super
[50:40] powers and he does Super things and he's
[50:42] a superhero but listen if if you're
[50:45] bulletproof and you stand in front of a
[50:46] gun that doesn't make you Brave
[50:49] hey man that doesn't show any sort of
[50:52] special virtue if you have super powers
[50:54] and you do super things with it that's
[50:57] not special as far as your character is
[50:59] concerned but a hero can be an ordinary
[51:02] person who knows that maybe even their
[51:04] life would be forfeit but they'll put
[51:07] themselves In Harm's Way they'll Hazard
[51:10] dangers that they choose to Hazard
[51:12] because for them the cause is greater
[51:15] than their own life
[51:17] amen
[51:19] should take somebody who maybe their
[51:20] abilities or whatever it's common but
[51:22] their character is so exceptional and it
[51:25] differs from anyone else and you notice
[51:28] it
[51:29] amen
[51:30] you know why is it when we're younger
[51:32] especially we're always looking up to
[51:33] different heroes in our lives we're
[51:35] looking at the the book of Hebrews and
[51:37] the the heroes of the faith as
[51:38] Christians we have so many God examples
[51:41] and why is it because when when a person
[51:44] is heroic when they take their stand it
[51:46] does something it inspires us and that's
[51:48] what makes it heroic when they put
[51:50] themselves in this condition and they
[51:52] they come through and people look at it
[51:54] it's an inspiration it rallies the
[51:57] people to a cause or a vision amen and
[52:01] that's what it is it represents
[52:03] something to us that's what makes it
[52:04] heroic that's what it represents
[52:06] something to you it represents something
[52:08] to I amen
[52:10] you know it's like our country's flag
[52:11] the flag in this country it used to mean
[52:14] something to people and it doesn't mean
[52:16] to many people what it used to mean amen
[52:18] when that Star-Spangled Banner flew over
[52:20] Fort McHenry and and uh and Francis
[52:23] Scott Key wrote that it meant something
[52:25] to him it meant something to the people
[52:27] that were watching there amen when when
[52:29] Marines they stormed at the top of Iwo
[52:31] Jima during the second world war and six
[52:34] Marines they got up there and they
[52:35] raised the flag at the top of the hill
[52:37] what was the significance of a piece of
[52:39] cloth on a pole it's not the cloth that
[52:42] has the virtue it's not the step it's
[52:45] what it represented to the men that they
[52:48] would put themselves in the midst of a
[52:50] fire fight in the midst of battle to
[52:53] raise it up because it meant something
[52:55] to them
[52:56] hey man I was I when I was a kid I I and
[53:00] I had to go look it up because it had
[53:01] been so long ago but there was a story
[53:03] from the Civil War about a man named
[53:05] Thomas Plunkett that's a good old
[53:07] sassafras hillbilly name if I've ever
[53:09] heard one Thomas Plunkett well it's not
[53:11] as cool as magooless I guess
[53:13] Thomas plunken anybody ever heard of
[53:15] Thomas Plunkett they called him the hero
[53:17] of four words and I'll explain in a
[53:18] moment Thomas Plunkett was in the Union
[53:20] Army and he'd fought at the Battle of uh
[53:22] of Gettysburg he'd been at
[53:24] Fredericksburg he'd been these different
[53:25] places and one day I'm sorry he's at the
[53:27] Battle of Fredericksburg one day and
[53:29] he's fighting and they had the standard
[53:31] Bearer with the Union flag in front of
[53:33] them and they were waving into gunfire
[53:35] and the guy that held the standard he
[53:36] got shot down and as the flag began to
[53:39] fall another man ran up and grabbed the
[53:42] flag that the flag would not fall to the
[53:45] ground
[53:45] and when that mental third man came in
[53:48] and when that man felt Thomas Plunkett
[53:50] he was the only one close enough he went
[53:52] and grabbed the American flag he grabbed
[53:54] the Union flag and he held it high and
[53:56] he cried out four words don't let it
[53:58] fall
[53:59] don't let it fall boys and and as he
[54:01] takes the flag uh Cannon fires and the
[54:04] shrapnel lands in him and it explodes
[54:06] and it rips off one of his arms
[54:09] and he think he'll get shot and he loses
[54:10] his other arm he's lost both arms and he
[54:14] still holding the American flag with the
[54:17] stump of one of his arms up
[54:20] and it becomes such a great hero they
[54:22] give him a medal they you know they do
[54:24] all these things after the war but
[54:25] that's what he was known as the hero of
[54:27] four words because he held up a flag now
[54:29] I want you to understand that flag is
[54:31] just a piece of cloth in and of itself
[54:33] if you took one of my suits today and
[54:36] you hung it on a pole and said I'm gonna
[54:38] shoot at that that suit and I want you
[54:39] to go get it I'll be like you know what
[54:40] I'll go get another one
[54:43] I'll go to pennies or The Bargain Bin or
[54:45] whatever you can keep it amen the virtue
[54:48] of the flag was not in its with material
[54:51] it represents something it represents
[54:54] men who died lives that were lost blood
[54:57] that was shed it represents something
[55:00] that's what makes it heroic that's what
[55:02] makes it so great that a man would lose
[55:04] his limbs a man with hazardous life
[55:07] for it amen listen this Bible is just a
[55:10] book it's that's all you treat it as but
[55:11] when you realize what was paid for it
[55:13] how many rules are coming across them
[55:16] pay and William Kendall for you and I to
[55:19] stand here today and preach out of this
[55:20] Bible right when you realize what it
[55:22] costs a man like William random to
[55:24] preach this message he knew it would
[55:26] cost him ten thousand friends he knew it
[55:28] would cost a lot of kinds of things but
[55:30] they stood there because they believed
[55:32] in what it was saying
[55:34] yeah that's not the book it's the one
[55:36] that testifies of Jesus Christ that's
[55:39] why we're here today that's why we
[55:41] related our lives for this gospel
[55:43] because it represents something greater
[55:46] than your life or my life that
[55:48] represents Jesus Christ in the Saints of
[55:51] all ages
[55:53] it means something to us
[55:56] yes more than just paper and gilded
[55:58] pages and represents something and
[56:00] that's what makes it special and
[56:02] yes sir amen that's what makes the flag
[56:05] special it's not the flag it's what it
[56:08] represents
[56:09] dangers that were endured and soldiers
[56:12] people that paid they paid with their
[56:14] lives so you and I could sing here today
[56:15] and bellyache about to go
[56:17] you know I can complain about gas prices
[56:19] well listen somebody paid a price for us
[56:21] to be able to do that yeah
[56:23] yeah we take it for granted and that's
[56:24] why we find ourselves in a defeated
[56:26] condition this country in a defeated
[56:29] condition having rejected the gospel
[56:31] because they forgot they didn't remember
[56:34] the Lord they forgot how they got here
[56:37] they forgot the price of their father's
[56:39] paid in the revolution all right
[56:42] listen that's just a natural War brother
[56:44] man talks about this it's a 1960
[56:46] unchangeable word of God it's at these
[56:49] wars you take these young kids out just
[56:50] the cream of the crop because they don't
[56:53] know no better no known discipline Army
[56:55] discipline stick your head up over the
[56:57] hill and let somebody shoot it off die
[56:59] like a hero they gladly do it
[57:01] run up on one of them he said run there
[57:04] on one and shot down another and shot
[57:05] down shot down the nation forgets them
[57:08] unless their family
[57:10] come back this here whenever they come
[57:11] back Jesus you see what I mean many of
[57:13] the soldiers but Sodom oh my
[57:16] God but a man sell them will you ever
[57:18] find one that'll lay down his life for
[57:20] the cause of Christ
[57:22] he won't even cry oh my God he wouldn't
[57:25] cry on the shade tree and go to church
[57:29] he won't even get out from behind the
[57:31] television long enough to attend the
[57:33] Wednesday Wednesday night prayer meeting
[57:34] that's right it's a shame disgrace he
[57:37] said that's the reason Angels don't
[57:38] visit the churches that's the reason
[57:40] Angels don't visit homes we've got to
[57:42] get down to deep sincerity of this thing
[57:45] the angels of God are here on Earth
[57:48] tonight
[57:49] that night on that night tonight they're
[57:52] here today
[57:54] he says just the same as they've always
[57:57] been yes
[57:58] yes amen
[58:00] what kind of a what kind of heroism

[58:22] that's not a little thing you're the
[58:24] Fifth Gospel right right and then listen

[58:30] motherhood is so distorted and perverted
[58:32] listen you've got women they won't raise
[58:34] their kids at all or they refuse to even
[58:36] have children they won't they won't lead
[58:38] to the Lord and anything and you've got

[58:52] the Lord whether you realize that's a
[58:54] heroic thing you're just taking your
[58:56] stand upon the word listen your kids are

[59:43] making statues of them they're singing
[59:45] songs ain't it that man didn't go out
[59:47] that day thinking man they're gonna sing
[59:49] songs about me they're going to preach
[59:50] about me that he wasn't that's not why
[59:52] he was out there but he was out there
[59:54] for his homeland he woke up one morning
[59:56] probably like most of us would on the
[59:58] cold hard ground probably didn't feel
[1:00:00] too great and he went out there when he
[1:00:02] looked down the spears of these trained
[1:00:05] soldiers we looked down and saw the
[1:00:07] threat of whorham it dawned on him there
[1:00:09] must be a way
[1:00:10] for Liberty
[1:00:12] and he said you men you harping
[1:00:14] underneath today I died for Switzerland
[1:00:18] well what will you do Arnold Von Winkler
[1:00:20] read he said I'm going to take my arms
[1:00:21] and I'm going to charge the enemy with
[1:00:23] nothing in my hand but when I charge the
[1:00:26] enemy I'll take their Spears and draw
[1:00:28] them into my bosom and when I do you men
[1:00:31] charge right when I do not sit there and
[1:00:34] watch you charge I will make a way for
[1:00:37] Liberty
[1:00:39] listen one man made a decision and one
[1:00:43] man made a decision that led an entire
[1:00:45] nation to Liberty has kept them to this
[1:00:48] day
[1:00:50] I'm on
[1:00:53] the brand often he quotes
[1:00:56] young fellows the Psalm of Life
[1:00:59] it says in the world's broad field of
[1:01:01] battle
[1:01:02] and the biblical lack of Life be not
[1:01:05] like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The
[1:01:08] Strife
[1:01:09] hey man I want you to understand
[1:01:12] something I'm not just using this poem
[1:01:14] for a Doctrine but you cannot be a hero
[1:01:16] in the time of ease or peace
[1:01:19] amen right there must be some
[1:01:21] extraordinary circumstances that come
[1:01:24] along
[1:01:25] and then without chaos there's no Heroes
[1:01:27] but it's it's in the time of strife it's
[1:01:30] the time of difficulty like a banner
[1:01:32] like a flag when they're lifted up when
[1:01:35] you see their example that's when that's
[1:01:39] when it's going to miss the chaos amen
[1:01:42] it's not so much that Strife makes
[1:01:44] people in the heroes
[1:01:47] amen difficulties and trials and
[1:01:51] tribulations all they do is reveal what
[1:01:53] kind of a characters are you in the
[1:01:55] first place
[1:01:56] and we we try to avoid trials and God's
[1:01:59] saying listen those fiery trials they're
[1:02:01] worth more than gold Prime of fire the
[1:02:04] trying your faith is worth something to
[1:02:06] God
[1:02:07] the God is trying to reveal the
[1:02:08] character of this bribe of Jesus Christ
[1:02:10] that should not like a bunch of cattle
[1:02:12] you're not cattle you're sheep
[1:02:15] and you're on the right Shepherd amen
[1:02:17] you're not driven by the things of this
[1:02:19] world
[1:02:21] praise the Lord
[1:02:22] it's a difficulty it reveals
[1:02:25] Heroes
[1:02:26] you know here a few months back uh so so
[1:02:30] I'm a gun guy a little bit not an expert
[1:02:33] I'm an American

[1:02:39] pass this bill here a while back they're

[1:02:42] ban this and that and that's when all
[1:02:43] the keyboard Warriors come on all these
[1:02:46] men with their keyboards and their lazy
[1:02:48] boys ah they'll have to
[1:02:50] oh
[1:02:53] wow you're a big man there and I'm
[1:02:56] shaking won't go near that guys how's he
[1:02:58] might have to get up out of his chair
[1:03:02] you know what I'm saying Everybody Talks
[1:03:04] big
[1:03:05] oh if this happens I'm gonna be on my
[1:03:07] front lawn and I'll be defying the
[1:03:09] government and I'll be doing this Muscle
[1:03:11] Man gonna do nothing you know why
[1:03:14] because they don't do nothing now
[1:03:15] foreign
[1:03:25] but what do you do when the trial comes
[1:03:28] that's what proves whether you're here
[1:03:30] I'm not who talks a big game everybody
[1:03:32] can talk well praise the Lord
[1:03:35] listen we stand here and I'm grateful
[1:03:37] today to stand here in a message church
[1:03:39] and preach to people that believe this
[1:03:40] message that sympathize with this
[1:03:42] message but that by itself isn't heroic
[1:03:45] listen it's easy to preach the people
[1:03:47] believe what you believe
[1:03:48] oh well listen if I you know I'm going
[1:03:50] to defy the world unless that man they
[1:03:53] can't even they can't do nothing for the
[1:03:54] Lord if everybody's not watching the
[1:03:56] church
[1:03:57] well praise Lord will people they might
[1:03:59] not like me they might not like what I
[1:04:00] have to say they didn't like what the
[1:04:02] prophets had to say hi there that's why
[1:04:04] they killed him and Jesus said be like
[1:04:07] one of them right
[1:04:08] all right praise the Lord
[1:04:10] the Bible says if you faint in the day
[1:04:12] of adversity your strength is small
[1:04:15] it doesn't matter how much you can bench
[1:04:16] press it don't matter how much you can
[1:04:18] lift if you can work 16 hours a day when
[1:04:20] Trouble Comes if you can't take a stand
[1:04:22] your strength is small
[1:04:27] amen well be not dumb driven cattle
[1:04:31] hey man I always use this point you know
[1:04:33] cattle they're driven but she followed
[1:04:35] hey man a lot of people they're just
[1:04:37] driven they'll they'll say I'm gonna do
[1:04:40] this and I'll Never back up on this
[1:04:42] message and I'll never do that but the
[1:04:44] first sign of Trouble Comes they're
[1:04:46] driven by fear
[1:04:49] it's like I used the example there uh
[1:04:51] with the government well you know I
[1:04:52] believe we should Render unto Caesar
[1:04:54] well I believe that too but here's the
[1:04:55] problem most people they don't render
[1:04:57] under Caesar because they believe in
[1:04:58] obedience because they're afraid Caesar
[1:05:01] and most people will do whatever fear
[1:05:04] drives them to do and listen that's not
[1:05:06] remarkable
[1:05:08] if you're just here today because you
[1:05:10] feel compelled to be here today because
[1:05:12] you're afraid of the consequences listen
[1:05:13] you need a little more you need a bigger
[1:05:15] backbone it's time to get rid of the
[1:05:17] wishbone amen
[1:05:19] praise the Lord
[1:05:22] my concern is that people go along with
[1:05:24] things or don't go along with things
[1:05:26] they're not doing it for an ethical
[1:05:28] reason or because it's right or wrong
[1:05:29] they do it because of what is convenient
[1:05:32] hey man but if you always just do you
[1:05:35] just ah you know I'm gonna go whichever
[1:05:37] way the wind blows I'm gonna do whatever
[1:05:38] makes everybody happy that's a coward
[1:05:41] hey man
[1:05:42] brother man said God don't want cowards
[1:05:44] he wants somebody who will stand
[1:05:47] he didn't want somebody that's ashamed
[1:05:49] to testify their boss he don't want
[1:05:51] somebody that's afraid to tell the
[1:05:53] doctor that God healed you he wants a
[1:05:55] hero
[1:05:57] amen how do you act when it's not a
[1:06:00] favorable condition how do you act when
[1:06:02] the conditions are against you when the
[1:06:04] odds are stacked against you that will
[1:06:05] show what kind of character you have
[1:06:09] amen praise the Lord
[1:06:12] amen well I just it's the truth many
[1:06:13] people they're like I said they're just
[1:06:15] whichever way the wind blows why because
[1:06:17] they're chaff for the wind
[1:06:19] has a word for that cannon fodder
[1:06:22] no I I don't like to think of people
[1:06:24] that way but it's true but that's what
[1:06:26] most of the world is it's just a bunch
[1:06:27] of Cannon butter they're just there to
[1:06:30] go about their day-to-day they collect a
[1:06:32] paycheck they watch their favorite game
[1:06:34] they do their favorite thing and they
[1:06:35] just go from day to day they're driven
[1:06:38] like cattle
[1:06:39] it's just a number in the system but for
[1:06:43] you and I there's something different
[1:06:44] about us
[1:06:46] amen we're not citizens of this world
[1:06:49] we're citizens of a greater Kingdom a
[1:06:51] greater world
[1:06:53] I mean you not you might not be great in
[1:06:56] this world but there's a greater world
[1:06:58] of which you are a part of you're a
[1:07:00] citizen you're a fellow Heir with Jesus
[1:07:02] Christ
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:07] oh my
[1:07:09] god listen if we were just here to eat
[1:07:10] and drink and be merry that'd be one
[1:07:11] thing but listen your soul it's worth
[1:07:13] ten thousand words
[1:07:15] that person next to you their soul is
[1:07:18] worth ten thousand worlds to God that
[1:07:20] person at work that drives you nuts
[1:07:22] their soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[1:07:24] to God that family member just drives
[1:07:26] you up a wall but guess what their soul
[1:07:28] is worth ten thousand worlds to God
[1:07:31] you can run away from all your troubles
[1:07:33] or you can take a stand and believe God
[1:07:37] because there are people that are driven
[1:07:39] like cattle but then there's some people
[1:07:41] they're sheep they just don't know who
[1:07:43] to follow yet
[1:07:44] amen Jesus dealt with the same thing
[1:07:46] Mark chapter six Jesus he looked out and
[1:07:49] he saw the people in the Bible said he
[1:07:50] had compassion toward them because they
[1:07:52] were a sheep
[1:07:54] not having a Shepherd he began to teach
[1:07:57] them
[1:07:57] many things
[1:07:59] see Jesus saw their need for direction
[1:08:03] Jesus offered them a way of Direction
[1:08:05] Jesus is the direction he is the way of
[1:08:09] Direction amen
[1:08:10] and brother man said he's the greatest
[1:08:12] example of heroism we've ever had Jesus
[1:08:14] Christ like a great Banner this hero of
[1:08:17] a greater world he was what was he done
[1:08:19] he was lifted up
[1:08:21] amen when did he fulfill his purpose
[1:08:25] when he was lifted up he healed the sick
[1:08:28] he raised the dead he cast out Devils he
[1:08:31] cleansed lepers but when the son of man
[1:08:33] was lifted up
[1:08:34] he said if I the son of man be lifted up
[1:08:37] I will draw all men unto me
[1:08:41] listen he's lifted up he fulfilled his
[1:08:43] purpose and he cried and he's finished
[1:08:45] and they threw him in the grave but this
[1:08:47] same Jesus God has highly exalted him
[1:08:50] once again
[1:08:52] his exaltation is the Salvation to
[1:08:55] everyone that believed because he was
[1:08:58] lifted up
[1:08:59] [Music]
[1:09:00] amen listen to the Bible says when he
[1:09:02] ascended what did he do he led
[1:09:05] he land captivity captive we've got a
[1:09:08] great Captain a leadership we're not
[1:09:11] cattle today we are being led by an
[1:09:14] undefeated Captain the captain of the
[1:09:17] host of the honor the Lord is leading us
[1:09:19] today if he can lead captivity Captain
[1:09:22] if he can lead him out of grave that
[1:09:24] they've been in for thousands of years
[1:09:26] he can lead you to the promise he can
[1:09:28] leave your home he can leave their job
[1:09:30] he can leave you wherever he needs to
[1:09:32] lead you
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:36] Isaiah chapter 11 in that day there
[1:09:39] shall be a root of Jesse which shall
[1:09:41] stand for an end sin it's a banner it's
[1:09:44] a pennant an Ace and for the people to
[1:09:47] it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest
[1:09:51] shall be glorious
[1:09:53] amen Paul quotes us again in Romans 15.
[1:09:56] he says Isaiah said there shall be a
[1:09:58] root of Jesse and he that shall rise to
[1:10:01] Reign Over the Gentiles in him shall the
[1:10:05] Gentiles Trust
[1:10:07] so I want you to really understand this
[1:10:08] that's why I talk about the flag earlier
[1:10:10] hero is like a banner they're lifted up
[1:10:12] their example lifted up before the
[1:10:15] people give them a direction it inspires
[1:10:18] them Psalm 60 says Thou Hast given a
[1:10:20] banner to them that fear thee and it may
[1:10:23] be displaying
[1:10:25] and then it doesn't work unless it's on
[1:10:27] display
[1:10:28] right it's like a token amen it's got to
[1:10:30] be on display to be effective
[1:10:33] oh my
[1:10:34] he said that it may be displayed because
[1:10:36] of that truth Selah that thy beloved may
[1:10:40] be delivered save with thy right hand
[1:10:44] and hear me
[1:10:46] so here's the things about a banner
[1:10:47] there it's it's an identification it's
[1:10:50] visible
[1:10:51] and it's elevated and when it does all
[1:10:54] those things it gives a direction it's
[1:10:57] like a banner and the scripture calls
[1:10:59] god Jehovah Nissi the Lord is my banner
[1:11:02] you remember the story in the book of
[1:11:04] Exodus the 17th chapter when the people
[1:11:06] of Israel begin to make war and and
[1:11:09] Moses he stood Atop The Hill he stood
[1:11:12] atop the mountain and he lifted up his
[1:11:14] hands and when he lifted up his hands
[1:11:17] when they were elevated when he raised
[1:11:19] them the people fought and the people
[1:11:20] had victory
[1:11:22] finally and after a while it began to
[1:11:24] get tired
[1:11:26] I thought about that the other day
[1:11:28] said how long does fight go I realized
[1:11:30] he was an 80 year old man but his
[1:11:32] strength wasn't diminished so you know
[1:11:33] he's like a 40 year old man who should
[1:11:35] be able to do a little bit and then I
[1:11:36] thought about well I'm about 40. if I do
[1:11:38] this for a few minutes start getting
[1:11:39] tired
[1:11:41] don't pick almost it's not his fault
[1:11:44] Moses he's holding his hands up as an
[1:11:47] instant of Victory and when his hands
[1:11:50] begin to get heavy the people begin to
[1:11:53] turn the other way in the battle so so
[1:11:55] the Bible says that Aaron and her they
[1:11:58] sat Moses on a rock oh yeah they sent
[1:12:01] him on a rock he said Moses if you can't
[1:12:04] stand sit on this Rock Rest on this rock
[1:12:06] and we'll hold your hands up
[1:12:09] if we can't if listen if you're not a
[1:12:11] Moses today then you hold up the hands
[1:12:13] of whoever Moses is
[1:12:15] amen we're not all called to be the
[1:12:17] seventh messenger but we can hold up the
[1:12:19] message that he preached we're not all
[1:12:23] called to be the pastor but when the
[1:12:24] pastor gets down when the pastor goes
[1:12:26] through things you can hold him up in
[1:12:28] prayer
[1:12:29] because listen he's giving us an answer
[1:12:31] this message has been given as a banner
[1:12:34] and it was there
[1:12:36] it was there when they had victory over
[1:12:39] the enemy
[1:12:40] there he was called Jehovah Nissi the
[1:12:43] Lord is my banner the Lord is my refuge
[1:12:48] you look at that word in the Hebrew it's
[1:12:50] something that is exalted when he's
[1:12:52] lifted up
[1:12:54] then we had Victory then he was a refuge
[1:12:57] to us
[1:12:58] amen don't take the band and fold it up
[1:13:00] and put in the claws and break it out on
[1:13:02] Memorial Day and Veterans Day Hold It Up
[1:13:05] Lift It Up over every enemy lift it up
[1:13:09] over every circumstance in your life
[1:13:12] the Bible says when the enemy comes in
[1:13:16] like a flag
[1:13:18] not when things are going well
[1:13:20] not when everything's just peaching and
[1:13:22] you're living on the Bed of Roses when
[1:13:24] the enemy's coming in like a flood God
[1:13:26] said I
[1:13:28] am
[1:13:29] gonna raise up a standard I will lift up
[1:13:32] a people filled with my spirit in
[1:13:35] defiance of every enemy in defiance of
[1:13:38] all the powers of Darkness I will raise
[1:13:40] up a people my spirit it won't be by
[1:13:43] your might it's not by your power it's
[1:13:45] by his Spirit his spirit and you defies
[1:13:49] the world it defies every Power of the
[1:13:52] enemy
[1:13:53] man
[1:13:55] listen when the enemies coming like a
[1:13:56] flood that's not the time to sit down
[1:13:57] and fold your hands right that's the
[1:13:59] time to take your stand say God's never
[1:14:02] left himself without a witness
[1:14:04] and this day is no different my God is
[1:14:08] still God
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:13] well
[1:14:18] be a hero well that's probably a good
[1:14:21] sign you're called to be
[1:14:24] brother Brown says this in perfect
[1:14:25] strength my perfect weakness he says
[1:14:29] notice it takes the weakest
[1:14:33] and the rejected
[1:14:35] and practically every hero that God ever
[1:14:38] had on the front line was that type of
[1:14:40] person
[1:14:43] that's that person Moses was there he is
[1:14:46] telling God listen I can't do this I
[1:14:47] can't do this I can't do this well look
[1:14:49] you can't because I said you can
[1:14:52] there's getting behind the wine press
[1:14:54] listen he's threshing wheat behind he's
[1:14:56] not even the right place he's hiding out
[1:14:59] he's not pressing wheat in the wheat
[1:15:01] field or barley in The Barley field he's
[1:15:02] behind the wine press and God says
[1:15:04] you're a mighty man of Valor
[1:15:07] one might think God was being cruel is
[1:15:09] God trying to make fun of me no God sees
[1:15:11] something in you you don't see because
[1:15:14] God knew when the battle come where did
[1:15:16] he was going to take his stand
[1:15:20] praise God
[1:15:23] he says this a person that was rejected
[1:15:26] a person that thought he was
[1:15:28] insufficient
[1:15:30] a person that had no ability at all
[1:15:33] right then that person is just in good
[1:15:35] shape
[1:15:36] so God can start using them
[1:15:39] that's right it's when they feel like
[1:15:42] they can't
[1:15:44] a couple you've been there before
[1:15:46] probably all of you if you're being real
[1:15:48] honest it's when they feel like they
[1:15:51] can't they haven't got nothing that's
[1:15:53] when God can take a hold of them and do
[1:15:55] something with them
[1:15:59] but when we are thinking that we are
[1:16:01] able to do it then God can't use us
[1:16:04] because we're wanting to do it ourselves
[1:16:07] this is the other side we get these
[1:16:09] feelings that we think that we're
[1:16:10] insufficient and we don't want to do it
[1:16:12] but if then if we'll listen to the call
[1:16:14] of God that's the very thing that God
[1:16:17] wants us to get into that kind of shape
[1:16:21] so he can
[1:16:22] hey man I mentioned William Tyndall
[1:16:24] earlier these men in the throughout the
[1:16:27] scripture and throughout history I want
[1:16:28] you to understand the they were not seen
[1:16:30] well by their contemporaries
[1:16:33] amen the people didn't love the prophets
[1:16:35] of all until they killed him first
[1:16:37] amen listen brother bam said Jesus he
[1:16:40] was a renegade to the people your lord
[1:16:43] was not labeled as some lofty wonderful
[1:16:46] person listen they loved it when he
[1:16:48] healed the sick they loved it when he
[1:16:50] did all these Miracles when he
[1:16:51] multiplied the loaves but when you get
[1:16:53] to preach I am a father of one they
[1:16:55] wanted nothing to do with him he's a
[1:16:56] troublemaker he's flipping over tables
[1:16:59] just everywhere he goes it's a bunch of
[1:17:00] trouble
[1:17:01] all these message people why can't they
[1:17:04] just get along with everybody else why
[1:17:05] can't they just compromise their doctor
[1:17:07] a little bit we're not asking for them
[1:17:09] to stop dressing a certain way of this
[1:17:11] thing just kind of compromise a little
[1:17:13] that
[1:17:14] and then listen why they're going to be
[1:17:16] so Troublesome all the time because they
[1:17:18] believe God
[1:17:19] that's why because they don't care what
[1:17:22] man has to say about it
[1:17:23] and listen you're going to be labeled as
[1:17:25] a renegade you're going to be called
[1:17:26] every kind of name of the book
[1:17:34] well you're just a fanatican you're just
[1:17:36] this and you're in a cult no I believe
[1:17:38] the Lord Jesus Christ I believe every
[1:17:40] word in this Bible it's yeah and amen to
[1:17:42] me
[1:17:43] I don't have to compromise I don't have
[1:17:45] to water it down I don't have to update
[1:17:47] it
[1:17:48] there's no virtue in compromising that
[1:17:53] hey Matt
[1:17:55] listen these men
[1:17:57] like I said they they were not regarded
[1:17:59] as Heroes by their contemporaries listen
[1:18:03] Jesus wasn't regarded as a hero by the
[1:18:05] people of Israel they hate him to this
[1:18:06] day
[1:18:09] but they're Heroes
[1:18:11] they're not Heroes of this world
[1:18:13] that's the difference they're not the
[1:18:16] heroes that make history books they're
[1:18:17] not the heroes we build statues to
[1:18:19] they're not the heroes that can't sing
[1:18:20] songs about all the time they're not the
[1:18:22] heroes of this world is why they're the
[1:18:24] heroes of another world of a greater
[1:18:26] world and Jesus is not the hero of this
[1:18:28] world all right and anytime we try to
[1:18:30] present them that way make a social
[1:18:32] gospel of it we've diminished the
[1:18:34] strength of it his strength his his
[1:18:36] image as a hero is not what he's doing
[1:18:38] in this world to the world for the world
[1:18:41] but it's like he's been exalted over
[1:18:43] he's greater this world does not compare
[1:18:46] there's nothing here that can compare
[1:18:49] the things that he has prepared for us
[1:18:51] this world nothing here is worthy to be
[1:18:54] compared to it
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:58] even the natural these these men and
[1:19:00] these women they did these things they
[1:19:02] weren't doing it for the world they
[1:19:03] lived in they did it for the world that
[1:19:05] they were trying to create they did it
[1:19:07] for the world that they wanted for their
[1:19:08] children for their families for their
[1:19:10] posterities they had a vision they had
[1:19:13] an ambition for something greater and
[1:19:15] their acts changed the world
[1:19:18] they're asked to change the world
[1:19:19] socially or politically what about Jesus
[1:19:22] Christ he's going to make all things new
[1:19:25] the Bible says behalf I make all heavens
[1:19:27] and earth new he's creating a new Earth
[1:19:30] whether and dwell with righteousness
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:37] I think of Nehemiah here at the
[1:19:39] beginning
[1:19:40] that I read about
[1:19:42] one thing I love about Nehemiah he's a
[1:19:44] he's a seemingly innocuous or
[1:19:46] inconspicuous person he's the king's cup
[1:19:49] Bearer The Bible doesn't say that you
[1:19:51] know he was the father so and so and
[1:19:52] this and that and he's got some great
[1:19:54] lineage of David
[1:19:55] doesn't say that Nehemiah you know like
[1:19:57] David he was on the head of an excellent
[1:19:58] Spirit nobody knew who Nehemiah hardly
[1:20:01] was
[1:20:01] but one day Nehemiah heard there was
[1:20:04] trouble in the Homeland
[1:20:06] he heard about trouble you know what he
[1:20:09] was not indifferent to his plight
[1:20:11] he was not indifferent to his people he
[1:20:14] began to weep and he become sad and he
[1:20:17] began to pray
[1:20:19] he began to seek the Lord and so Lord
[1:20:21] we've we've done you wrong we've done
[1:20:23] evil against you but Lord you hear these
[1:20:26] people you hear the threatenings you see
[1:20:28] the condition he began to cry out to God
[1:20:31] God there's got to be a change there's
[1:20:34] got to be a Deliverance for these people
[1:20:38] God picks up this man Nehemiah that
[1:20:40] nobody paid any attention to one day the
[1:20:42] king notices well you look kind of sad
[1:20:44] what's going on
[1:20:47] it's funny how God will take somebody
[1:20:48] that seems
[1:20:49] so insignificant to the world
[1:20:52] amen right maybe you feel like you're
[1:20:54] that person listen that's the type of
[1:20:55] people God uses
[1:20:56] hey man God's Not Looking listen it's
[1:20:59] like even the prophet Samuel think about
[1:21:01] that here's a here's an anointed prophet
[1:21:03] of God and he goes to visit the house of
[1:21:05] Jesse
[1:21:06] he said oh well here's the oldest that's
[1:21:09] got to be it no that's not what I picked
[1:21:11] what about this one about this one no I
[1:21:13] want that little that little wimp over
[1:21:15] that little shrimp right there I want
[1:21:16] him I'm annoying that's a man that's not
[1:21:19] a little boy that's a man after my own
[1:21:21] heart
[1:21:24] beautiful this is the guy listen God
[1:21:26] doesn't judge his men judge and then
[1:21:29] look at the outward appearance
[1:21:32] we look and say well this hero he's got
[1:21:33] a big symbol on his chest and big
[1:21:35] muscles and it's not that don't make you
[1:21:36] a hero man's not to turn by the size of
[1:21:39] his muscles he's not determined by the
[1:21:41] size of his bank account but by the bags
[1:21:43] in his knees where he's been praying
[1:21:45] that's what determines what makes a man
[1:21:48] praise the Lord
[1:21:52] this man he and I love Nehemiah because
[1:21:54] he's a man of he's a man of remarkable
[1:21:56] vision
[1:21:57] ambition again he's a pragmatic he's a
[1:22:00] methodical person but yet he's a man of
[1:22:03] great faith and hope and God and what I
[1:22:05] love about Nehemiah in this context
[1:22:07] especially what I'm talking about today
[1:22:08] is Nehemiah was the type of person that
[1:22:10] knew how to Rally the people together
[1:22:13] when people were discouraged when people
[1:22:15] were frightened and the people didn't
[1:22:18] know what to do Nehemiah wasn't just
[1:22:20] we'll just get scared and hide your buns
[1:22:23] uh a rock or something
[1:22:25] no he was a man that said but remember
[1:22:27] we're here for a purpose
[1:22:30] remember that sickness you're going
[1:22:32] through you're here for a purpose that
[1:22:35] trial you're going through maybe your
[1:22:36] family's rejected you whatever it is but
[1:22:38] you're here for a purpose don't forget
[1:22:41] you're here to do something God's got
[1:22:43] confidence in you that you'll take a
[1:22:46] moral stand that you'll stand on this
[1:22:48] word in the hour of Temptation in the
[1:22:50] hour of adversity you won't faint
[1:22:53] because God in you is greater than he
[1:22:55] that's in the world
[1:22:58] oh yeah
[1:22:59] and in the scripture when the people
[1:23:01] become frightened he begins to speak to
[1:23:03] the Nobles and to the rulers and to the
[1:23:06] people and he says he says don't be
[1:23:09] afraid of the enemy don't be afraid of
[1:23:12] them remember the Lord
[1:23:15] remember the Lord which is great and
[1:23:18] terrible and fight for your brethren
[1:23:20] for your sons fight for your daughters
[1:23:23] your wives and your households this is
[1:23:26] me get discouraged many times because we
[1:23:28] don't remember the Lord
[1:23:30] we remember what the doctor said we
[1:23:32] remember what people in our lives said
[1:23:34] about us we think about everything we we
[1:23:36] read in the newspaper I want you to
[1:23:38] remember the Lord
[1:23:39] the next time you get discouraged the
[1:23:42] next time you get afraid remember the
[1:23:44] Lord
[1:23:45] and fight don't back down don't hide
[1:23:49] fight you've got a reason to fight
[1:23:52] why are we fighting fight for your sons
[1:23:54] fight for your daughters fight for your
[1:23:56] wives fight for your households
[1:23:59] remember the Lord how many remembers of
[1:24:02] the Lord today let's remember him
[1:24:04] let's forget about everything else let's
[1:24:07] press for the mark for the prize of the
[1:24:09] High Calling
[1:24:11] we can look at circumstances we can look
[1:24:13] at discouragement we can look at the
[1:24:15] Lord we can look at an end since it's
[1:24:17] been lifted up over us listen we've got
[1:24:19] every reason just stay in the battle
[1:24:22] we've got every reason to press the
[1:24:24] battle
[1:24:26] it's not a time to go settle down the
[1:24:28] bunker somewhere this is the time to
[1:24:30] press the battle
[1:24:32] Victory Is Ours already
[1:24:35] we're not fighting against the powerful
[1:24:37] enemy we're fighting a defeated enemy
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:45] we you know like I said we did we get
[1:24:47] discouraged with people sometimes but
[1:24:49] brother you don't know what people have
[1:24:50] done to me
[1:24:52] oh
[1:24:53] they might have done lots of things to
[1:24:54] you the Lord knows about it
[1:24:57] you know I think the problem many times
[1:24:58] with church
[1:25:00] we spend too much time fighting with
[1:25:02] people
[1:25:04] not enough time fighting poor people
[1:25:07] anybody Nehemiah didn't say remember the
[1:25:10] Lord fight your sons and fight your no
[1:25:12] that's not what he said
[1:25:13] sometimes when you're so busy fighting
[1:25:15] people
[1:25:16] we're supposed to be fighting for
[1:25:18] certain people
[1:25:19] supposed to be fighting for that one
[1:25:21] that one that hates you is the One
[1:25:23] You're supposed to love
[1:25:26] hey man oh but listen they just drive me
[1:25:28] up the wall and listen I get it
[1:25:34] unless it's sometimes fighting with
[1:25:36] people is fighting for people sometimes
[1:25:37] you gotta stand for something that's
[1:25:38] wrong I believe that amen right wait
[1:25:40] well praise the Lord
[1:25:43] we get so complacent as church people we
[1:25:45] don't want to rock the boat I'm saying
[1:25:46] wow
[1:25:49] I was talking to I was talking to some
[1:25:52] young people the other day I was talking
[1:25:53] about William Booth somebody knows who
[1:25:55] William Booth is part of the Salvation
[1:25:56] Army listen he came to church for the
[1:25:59] first he he'd grown up in like a formal
[1:26:01] dead church and he went to Methodist
[1:26:02] Church and this is back when the
[1:26:04] Methodist Church used to shout
[1:26:07] he comes in there and they're preaching
[1:26:09] salvation through Christ they're
[1:26:10] preaching you know uh everybody's saying
[1:26:13] amen hallelujah they're having a good
[1:26:14] time like this is great they get saved
[1:26:16] and he goes comes to the Lord and and
[1:26:18] then he he comes from a poor family he
[1:26:20] begins to preach the poor he goes to the
[1:26:22] docks he goes to peers he goes
[1:26:23] everywhere he's preaching the poor and
[1:26:25] he brings the poor to church one day
[1:26:26] he's evangelized all these people
[1:26:29] right he gets there and the churches
[1:26:30] they send the deacons out said we don't
[1:26:32] want him here
[1:26:34] now he loved this church is great I said
[1:26:37] we don't want these people here with
[1:26:38] we've got a certain image
[1:26:41] we've got a certain image we're trying
[1:26:43] to protect
[1:26:44] and he's thinking well that's not what
[1:26:46] the image was in the Bible
[1:26:48] amen listen that man he could have
[1:26:51] capitulated to make his ministry in the
[1:26:53] Methodist Church great but he took a
[1:26:55] stand
[1:26:56] and he began to produce soup kitchens
[1:26:57] and he began to feed the poor he began
[1:26:59] to educate him he created jobs for him
[1:27:01] listen one man took a stand
[1:27:04] amen and it changed the dynamic of
[1:27:06] England it changed the way labor worked
[1:27:08] in the whole country
[1:27:10] don't tell me God can't change the
[1:27:12] situation with one person amen that's
[1:27:14] all he needs
[1:27:16] but many times we stand and we're just
[1:27:18] complacent well that's just how it's
[1:27:20] going to be it doesn't have to be that
[1:27:21] way it's that way because you let it be
[1:27:24] that way
[1:27:25] all right
[1:27:26] well listen I've just always dealt with
[1:27:28] this and I've always had this problem
[1:27:29] well that's probably because you've
[1:27:31] always dealt with it the same way
[1:27:32] I mean you've complained about it you've
[1:27:34] tried to figure it out you've tried to
[1:27:35] reason with it you've tried to use
[1:27:37] wisdom how about you remember the Lord
[1:27:39] and lift him up one time
[1:27:42] instead of saying my lost loved ones why
[1:27:44] can't I get them to serve God why don't
[1:27:46] you just plead the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:27:47] for him for once say Lord I know you're
[1:27:50] more than able I've tried I've pleaded
[1:27:53] but Lord I'm trusting you now whatever
[1:27:56] sickness comes whatever problems comes
[1:27:58] I'm gonna lift up the name of the Lord
[1:28:00] over it now
[1:28:01] instead of fighting with everybody let's
[1:28:03] fight for them you've got people to
[1:28:06] fight for they're important
[1:28:09] you hold this token high today for our
[1:28:12] sons and for our daughters for our
[1:28:14] brother and our wives our households and
[1:28:17] I get it sometimes some of the hardest
[1:28:18] people to fight for
[1:28:20] and that wasn't a fight for people
[1:28:22] they're so ungrateful because Jesus did
[1:28:24] it for you when you were ungrateful
[1:28:26] because Jesus saw something in you when
[1:28:28] you weren't looking for him you weren't
[1:28:30] after him but he was lifted up for your
[1:28:32] Saints
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:34] I mean he's glad about what God's done
[1:28:36] in your life
[1:28:38] we're all glad right well listen he
[1:28:40] didn't do it because because you were
[1:28:42] grateful about it at the time actually
[1:28:43] we weren't even here at the time right
[1:28:44] we spend our lives in Rebellion against
[1:28:46] God we spend our lives chasing our own
[1:28:49] wealth but you know what he was lifted
[1:28:50] up for you regardless because he had
[1:28:52] confidence
[1:28:53] that what you were is not who you are
[1:28:58] that person you fight with that person
[1:28:59] said there's no chance
[1:29:02] brother Rim got that way one time
[1:29:06] amen he got to such a place because of
[1:29:09] being rejected over this message
[1:29:11] he lost his feeling for the people and
[1:29:13] he began to sass him call his rickies
[1:29:14] and rickettas and God said some of them
[1:29:18] are my children
[1:29:22] some of them people you don't think will
[1:29:23] ever make it they're the ones that are
[1:29:25] going to make it the Sinners and the
[1:29:27] publicans they enter into the kingdom
[1:29:28] first
[1:29:30] well praise the Lord
[1:29:32] amen
[1:29:34] Jesus shouldn't have got for us
[1:29:37] and we were unworthy we didn't want
[1:29:39] nothing to do with him we heart in our
[1:29:41] hearts against God he stood for us
[1:29:42] anyway
[1:29:43] sometimes you got to stick take a stand
[1:29:45] even when it's even when it's unpopular
[1:29:48] with the people that you're standing for
[1:29:51] you even when they don't care you still
[1:29:53] gotta take your stand oh my praise the
[1:29:56] Lord remember the Lord he said Jesus
[1:29:59] Christ is not the hero of this world
[1:30:02] he's the hero of a greater world
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:05] and I say this many times and I believe
[1:30:07] it there's only there there's really
[1:30:09] only one hero in this story there's many
[1:30:11] examples of Heroes and many examples of
[1:30:14] heroism but there's one real hero amen
[1:30:16] because without this hero none of us are
[1:30:18] here today none of us can take this
[1:30:21] stand it's because of what Jesus Christ
[1:30:22] had did for us if he had not fulfilled
[1:30:25] the law and the prophets if he not stood
[1:30:27] in the midst of opposition then we're
[1:30:29] dead in our sins today
[1:30:31] true and his heroism that's something we
[1:30:34] should remember you know I was looking
[1:30:35] about Sam Houston when he when he goes
[1:30:37] to fight General santiana down there in
[1:30:39] Texas they Remember the Alamo that
[1:30:42] become their Battle Cry remember what
[1:30:44] these men lay down for the independence
[1:30:47] of the Republic of Texas
[1:30:49] men like Davy Crockett and and Jim Bowie
[1:30:52] they laid down their lives and when they
[1:30:55] got to that massive remember now
[1:30:56] remember people have paved the way for
[1:30:59] us remember the Alamo
[1:31:02] hey man when we got into World War II
[1:31:04] they remembered Pearl Harbor every time
[1:31:06] they thought how can we go on what we're
[1:31:08] going to do remember what happened we
[1:31:11] will not forget we shall remember
[1:31:14] I remember what the enemy's done but I
[1:31:16] remember what the Lord has done
[1:31:19] when you get discouraged I want to
[1:31:21] remind you you remember the cross you
[1:31:24] remember the resurrection you remember
[1:31:26] there's an empty two you remember the
[1:31:28] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:30] don't forget when you forget that's when
[1:31:32] your strength is small but lift up the
[1:31:34] Lord amen
[1:31:36] amen listen we're not just women even
[1:31:39] now we have victory
[1:31:42] we've heard a message what is the
[1:31:44] message brother Vincent is a trumpet to
[1:31:46] declare a script to a war they're not
[1:31:49] here to negotiate with the Enemy today
[1:31:51] we're here for war we've heard the
[1:31:55] trumpet and Nehemiah said when you hear
[1:31:57] the trumpet you gather there don't
[1:32:00] gather on your reputation don't gather
[1:32:02] on ecclesiastical Spirits gather around
[1:32:05] where the trumpet is sounded why was the
[1:32:08] message sounded to gather the people
[1:32:11] together
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:16] they looked all spread out
[1:32:20] they're all spread along the wall they
[1:32:22] look like a separated people well
[1:32:24] brother so-and-so lives over here and
[1:32:26] so-and-so does this and they're doing

[1:34:25] when it's unpopular you can stand for
[1:34:27] this word when nobody likes it
[1:34:31] far a bit for me to back down when that
[1:34:33] man's willing to die for a flag
[1:34:37] we think I can't serve God it's just too
[1:34:40] hard that men didn't have an arm to hold

[1:35:03] I mean I was telling them testimonies
[1:35:05] earlier about my my health and stuff
[1:35:06] like that I don't stand up here today

[1:35:27] way listen as long as I'm dying in the
[1:35:28] will of God I can't die anyway right you
[1:35:32] can't die if you're a Christian you just
[1:35:34] change your destination let me declare
[1:35:37] let the prophet David occur I shall not
[1:35:40] die but live to declare the works of the
[1:35:43] Lord this is the Lord's doing it's
[1:35:45] marvelous in our eyes
[1:35:50] listen something you know about my
[1:35:51] testimony with my daughter Jana
[1:35:53] my daughter Jana when she was getting
[1:35:55] ready to be born the doctors induced my
[1:35:57] wife and and then the doctor he went off
[1:35:59] got coffee or something he just didn't
[1:36:00] show up for a while and I'm sitting in
[1:36:02] the hospital going well I don't know
[1:36:03] what's going on and the anesthesiologist
[1:36:05] comes in they want me to leave the room
[1:36:06] which they've never done that before but
[1:36:08] whatever so I leave the room and I come
[1:36:10] back 45 minutes later and they're
[1:36:11] whisking her out on a stretcher
[1:36:13] ah actually I was a little confused
[1:36:16] about the whole thing
[1:36:18] no idea what's going to happen
[1:36:20] will this nurse come in and she began to
[1:36:22] tell me that my my daughter Jana and her
[1:36:24] Court was prolapsed she hadn't gotten
[1:36:25] oxygen in other words it was pinched off
[1:36:27] in the birth canal and she hadn't
[1:36:29] breathed for 13 minutes before they even
[1:36:31] found it
[1:36:32] and they say brain damage sets in after
[1:36:35] 15 minutes no oxygen to the brain she'd
[1:36:37] already gone 13 before they even wheeled
[1:36:39] her out my wife out to do an emergency
[1:36:41] C-section so the nurses tell me all this
[1:36:44] and I'm thinking well okay whatever he
[1:36:46] said well your daughter's probably gonna
[1:36:47] have brain damage
[1:36:48] you know if she had told me that once
[1:36:50] I'd be like well she's just trying to do
[1:36:51] her job she just kept bringing it up and
[1:36:54] I'm thinking well I'm not having none of
[1:36:55] this listen I'll let you do it once oh
[1:36:58] and listen this is the thing I've got
[1:37:00] tremendous respect for parents that if
[1:37:02] their child has a disability or
[1:37:03] something they raise them I've got all
[1:37:04] the respect in the world for that I
[1:37:06] would have loved my child all the same
[1:37:07] when that nurse began pushing her
[1:37:09] narrative at me well listen it's just I
[1:37:11] I'm just trying to prepare you just
[1:37:13] really letting you know she said that
[1:37:14] the third time and I finally I looked at
[1:37:16] her said well listen I have a reason to
[1:37:17] be worried if I weren't a Christian
[1:37:21] I'd have a reason to worry if I weren't
[1:37:23] a Christian listen my God's Not I just I
[1:37:26] felt Within Myself people say were you
[1:37:28] afraid brother not one bit and that

[1:37:33] that's the Lord I remember the Lord my
[1:37:36] Lord is more than able he's more than
[1:37:39] able to deliver her
[1:37:41] God in my life when I should have died
