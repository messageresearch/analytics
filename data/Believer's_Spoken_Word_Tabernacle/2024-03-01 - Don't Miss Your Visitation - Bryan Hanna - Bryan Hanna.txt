that's living in inside of you amen amen let's take our Bibles tonight and open up in Luke Luke 17 29 and 30 amen real nervous so pray for me tonight just glad brother Samuel has giving me this opportunity and I just hope whatever um that I say tonight what the Lord has put upon my heart that it's a blessing to you just a couple familiar scriptures very familiar scriptures we've heard all of our days you know living in the message but brother brandom said never let never let scripture become common to you amen Luke 1729 and 30 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed Revelation 3:20 I'm not uh too skilled like brother Samuel yet I don't have the scriptures up there but we'll get there Revelations 3:20 says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice I will open the door and will open the door I will come in to him and will s with him and he with me one more scripture Malachi 45 amen Malachi 45 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just want to thank you Father for this opportunity tonight Lord and Lord I just feel your presence already father and I just ask you Lord to just help help me to get out of the way Lord and Lord just move in a special way tonight father Lord we're living in the last days Lord and we just want to hear from you Lord and we know that just any moment Lord you could come and take your bride away father and I just pray Lord you would meet the needs of your people tonight father and Lord just please help me get out of the way Lord and use the gift in my life I just want you to move Lord and people to have the people to have victory in their lives Lord and see where they are in this day and what you're trying to do father in the name of Jesus Christ am amenallah amen you may be seated God's only provided place to worship brother Brandon was speaking in in the beginning of the service he goes I was sitting over there talking to my old friend brother Brown while the songs were going on and he said brother brandham I never seen till yesterday today what you've been talking about he said If people could just get into what you're speaking about said every obstacle would move out of the way that's exactly right that's right it's exactly right if you could just grasp it grasp it and could catch it and my my topic tonight what the Lord's just been dealing with upon my heart is don't miss your visitation and you know we're living in the last days and evil is all around us and um you know Satan has tried to turn our eyes upon what's going on around us you know Russia and Ukraine getting in a war you know is everything going on with Israel you know homosexuality is on the rise they're trying to push it upon us but brother brandom said you know those are just distractions and not to fear hear that he said it's just turning you away from what's really going on and he's he was just saying don't miss your visitation because this is life or death and we're trying to gain eternal life and make the Rapture because God's in the midst of us trying to reveal himself but Satan's always trying to distract us amen and uh so I just begin to just wanted you to think about these questions what is a visitation and who are you pre pre uh preparing for to come when you know who is coming are you in expectation and an important thing for when you're having a visitation you always want to know when what time are they coming what time are they going to come and how are they going to come God always visits in the same pattern he never breaks his his word he always he always comes according to scripture and that's the only way we'll know what time and when he's coming and what he's going to do and the people he's getting prepared for and he's always wanting us to look for his coming because brother brandham said he'll only come to those who are looking for him amen everyone's looking for a last sign you know in in a couple months there's that so eclipse going on millions of people are coming here you know they're thinking there's people at work you know just they know it's the last last day and they're just thinking this is a sign in the heavens and you know just looking at all the wars and rumors of wars and all this going on but brother brandham said the last sign to the Gentile age he said I just wonder if we're not looking too forward ahead for something that's right by us wonder if it could be the same way if we could pass by our opportunity remember as the day the old types as the types can never break the last sign According To Jesus he said as it was in the days of Sodom lot so shall it be in the days when the son of man not Son of God now when the son of man is revealed looking at here where it's settling today amen and and that's what a lot of people are looking for people are looking for Jesus to come down from the sky though we believe that but that's it is according to scripture but he has he can't break his pattern just just like I read that quote from brother brandom he can never break his word he always comes according to scripture everyone's looking for nail scars and a crown of thorns but he's coming in flesh amen and I just want to bring that out tonight what is the son of man we know it's a prophet um brother brandom said he was the son of man because he had to come to reveal himself to Israel as a prophet and they rejected it and that was the prophecy they they should receive him in in the name of the son of man a prophet because it was according to the word Deuteronomy 18:15 when Moses spoke the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me and when he come he ident ID ified himself in his ministry as a man not a son of God Son a man God is a spirit and he revealed himself as son of man what he claimed to be and they was blinded and couldn't see it and it the son of man also means god coming down in flesh the spirit of God will come upon the Earth in a form of human beings God manifested in human flesh amen do you see it and would do the same thing that God did in human flesh at Sodom remember they were waiting for a promised son and right after that the promised son came and a lot of people ask you know why can't God just personally speak to me why a prophet why why doesn't God physically speak to me and if you look in the Old Testament just laying some Foundation here when Moses Moses came down from the mountain there was Thunders and Lightnings and the whole children of Israel was scared and they said unto Moses speak thou for us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but revealeth his Secrets unto the servants the prophets he wants to show he wants to uncover he wants to lead us amen amen and um who is this mzc and this is kind of my thought here of the the three comings of the son of man and taking the father dispensation the son dispensation and the Holy Ghost dispensation and that's the the three ways brother brandom said God will reveal himself God and imor who is this mzc he said God and imorph masked in a pillar of fire god and imor and A Man Called Jesus God and imor in his church God above us and the pillar of fire the father dispensation God With Us the son dispensation Jesus Christ God in us the Holy Spirit and if you just look at it with those three comings because God couldn't just come down and reveal himself because we couldn't handle it being in these beings this flesh so God had to slowly condens send down amen and in MDC uh but who is this mzc brother brandom said this man had no father no mother no beginning no ending he was a perfect being and that theophany just spoke grab some dust some dirt flesh that's what we made out of and he just stepped right into it with two other men and he began to walk to Abraham so that Pillar of Fire the father dispensation now and a perfect being brother brandom said that um brother Samuel and I were talking and you know I just like to grab some things from them and my father-in-law and just combined it into one and uh from my favorite preacher so hopefully he doesn't mind me stealing stuff but and uh so brother uh Samuel and I were just talking about it and um brother brandham said that notice if he had no beginning and no end that same God is still here what he did back then he's here today amen so I would just want to take the first dispensation MDC and a theophany body but then coming into flesh um in Genesis 18:1 you don't have to turn there but and it says and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamory and and he and so Abraham and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and also too I would just like to have you keep a thought in your mind that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen so just keep those Foundation of scriptures and in your mind as we go go through these things um and also don't miss your visitation and brother brandham said that during this time with Abraham Abraham just left all of his family God called him to be separated from all his family everything he ever knew knowed and um he started to walk by faith and uh he began to uh get some uh criticism from his wife um brother brandom said that day they had a fuss that morning and uh Sarah began to um now I know Sarah's a spiritual type of us but uh sometimes you like brother even Samuel said you got to you know sometimes you have to get off your type there so we're just going to look at what Abraham did versus Sarah amen and um so Abraham you know he was 100 years old Sarah was 90 years old and Abraham was always in expectation always preparing cuz he knew what God had promised him he knew he would be a father of many nations and he knew a son would come through him and through Sarah so he was always an expectation of that and uh so they began to have a fuss that morning Sarah was always looking down into Sodom where lot was with his uh Lot's wife you know she had the the latest hair dude she had the latest fashions um she always watched that the brother BR brandham called it a camel Caravan coming through with the latest fashions and that's what Sarah always had her mind on and that's what Satan always wants uh to uh distract us with is to get our minds on the world and to always miss what's coming right amen and um and brother Braham says but if she just knowed there was more than a caravan coming through there was a host of the Lord coming that W amen and uh so and also Sarah began to look at the latest fashions but she also began to say why why' you bring me out here you know kind of just like the children of Israel why did God bring us out here to just to die they're uh it was In the Heat of the day brother Braham said the the land was drying out all his cattle were dying um the herdsmen were being negative but uh he said poor old Abraham he just grabbed his chair and he grabbed his chair and put it right in front of his tent door and he bowed his head amen and he said now Satan was trying to block Abraham and Sarah because he knew that there was an Angelic visitation coming amen and then when everything Rises all out of order then we know something's wrong now I believe maybe if we listen to Satan we might miss miss it seeing it like Sarah did and as as Abraham sat his chair in front of the tent door um a lot of us men our our wives running their mouth and stuff like that we would like to you know bicker back and forth right and that's the carnal thing to do but uh brother brandham said he was always prayed up he was always praying to the Lord and that's why it's it's it's important to always being being in the spirit um to always be in expectation because you never know when your visitation coming and as brother um I'm sorry as Abraham was sitting at the tent door he just bows his head and begins to think about everything that God has ever done for him he begin to think about God Almighty and um and he said also notice he said brother B says I like that when Abraham just sat his sat his uh chair in front of the tent door he goes if you notice lot lot sat his chair at the gate and then he go because the tent door is access to your your dwelling place but the gate or I'm sorry the gate brings you out into the yard amen and that's that's the difference between the elect seat of God versus you know the the world they just want to keep Christ out in the front yard or in the backyard but we want the Holy Spirit to come into our lives amen Amen brother Braham said he kept himself in a spiritual at atmosphere all the time that he could recognize right from wrong all the time that's the way a Christian ought to do today is to keep yourself prayed up under spiritual atmosphere always never seeing never seeing the bad side looking to the good side you are children of God expecting His blessings and that quote just stuck out to me and it's I was listening to it today but that quote just stuck out out to me that never to look at the bad side always look to the good side and if you actually really think about it and get this Revelation that nothing bad ever happens to a son and daughter of God we may think something bad happens to us but the B the Bible says in Romans 8:28 that and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen there may be trials in your life you may be going through dark times just like Abraham where you just don't know where to turn things are drying up in your life you know family may be coming against you you may be you know your job may be in Jeopardy but that's just Satan trying to rob you of your blessing just like brother Brandon was saying and uh and just listening to that sermon again today is there anything too hard for the Lord I didn't catch it the first time but brother brandom actually mentions that verse we know that all things work out for the good to them that love God and I just thought it was a vindication if you could just catch that Revelation I I know we don't like tests and trials cuz it's against this flesh but there's something greater in US amen and brother Braham said she so Sarah she had herself all out of condition to receive to receive it when God brought it oh my don't never get that in your heart be open be ready she missed it she failed to see it Abraham out there waiting with anticipation you see it was made known to her it wasn't made known to her it was made known to them that was looking that's the way it comes yet to those who are looking so as Abraham bowed his head at the tent door he began to think on the Promises of God and when he raised his head he saw three men walking to him and brother brandom said there was there was a cry in his heart to go out and run to him and bow before him and he caught the revelation of not Lords like lot said but he said Lord yeah and when he bowed before him he didn't you know just speak to him just for a little bit and send him on his way he said come and stay let me cook for you I'll give you something to drink let me wash your feet just stay comfortable amen and that's what we need to do tonight is you know we don't need to leave him out in the front yard like lot did or in the backyard amen let him come inside you today amen hallu and uh so Abraham was looking for a sign you know of who this man was amen so this this man came in flesh and um as he sat down he called him by name Abraham where is thy wife and brother Ram said now how did this man know his name when before he was just called Abram and now he had a name change to Abraham and only one man knew that and that was Abraham so how did this man know his name and how did he know he was married and how and he said where is thy wife Sarah he didn't call her sari he called her Sarah so how did this man know amen it it just shows that there was more than a man amen so the the the son of man the that man that was sitting by the tent door um brother brandom dramatizes it his back towards uh the tent and Sarah began to ease drop and uh think about you know is this another man that you know Abraham just going to you know another fanatic guy you know just coming by you know but Abraham you know said this this is our visitation he he told her this is our visitation you know prepare some food amen and as as uh Sarah began to stay in her tent um she began to uh just listening to what the conversation was and this son of man was saying that you know I will I will return to you and and that according to the time of life and you you shall have that child and uh you know as we all know she she began to laugh and um as as she you know and then that son a man said why did why did your wife laugh with his back turned towards the tent he was outside she was inside and she didn't even laugh out loud the Bible says she laughed within her heart so who alone could know um that she laughed inside of her heart amen but we know that Sarah you know even though she lied face to face you know to God that you know she was part of the promise you know and that's you know and that and that's us you know all the times that you know we've fallen short and we've rejected God you know we we're we're connected to to our Abraham which is Jesus Christ amen but as as a son of man began to discern that was one of the signs the to discern and Abraham caught that sign amen and as we know I just uh want to stop there and as we know he received the the promised but shortly right after that that's when Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed with you know fire and brimstone so that was the father dispensation now we're condenscending down from the father to the son dispensation so this the father dispensation the first one had no mother no father no beginning no ending but brother Bram said Jesus had father had mother had beginning and had an ending because he aged you know he he looked 50 years old he had Mary and uh Joseph as his father and mother so um and uh just want to go with um keeping that tight but just remember to keep that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in your hearts and so we all know that the the sign of that uh son of man is to discern the heart and the famous story was the woman at the well this this Jesus Christ came to the woman at the well and um this woman brother brandham said she she was a prostitute um she you know her morals were completely gone and she couldn't come to draw water um with the other women who were pure but this this woman at the well we don't know her name but she was not pure so she had to come in the evening time you know um to to collect that water and as she began to walk to the well um let me see she began to um and brother Bram said she was more okay here we are and she came upon there with a pot on her head no doubt she was going along thinking now the man that I married or got a hold last night I'm doubting him he's a man he acts funny I just don't know about him I haven't got a chance I'm out from society and I can't go to those churches they don't just look at them I don't know what to do I'm in distress and I've been reading in the Bible so she even though she was you know a prostitute had her life all all messed up in her darkest times she was still a Bible reader and she began to dwell on those things as she was walking to the well you know about about the Messiah coming and just like brother Bram said he always comes to those that are looking for him and she begin to think surely someday that Prophet will come on the scene now if they know now I know they've claimed that there is no such thing and this is so maybe a hundred years off or a thousand years off we've been looking for that for a thousand years and it's never happened yet so we ain't looking for it now everything is is so oh no we got churches and things we don't need nothing like that now so then she's going along there thinking about these things and you know when she began to think about him that's when he appears like we had last night when they was on the road to emus when she thought on those things she heard a man say bring me a drink so as she began to dwell on these things she was just so caught up with everything she heard a voice that said bring me a drink what about it in her Darkest Hours when her morals was all gone maybe a pretty a pretty little old lady been turned on the street to live like that sometimes it's not the little girl's fault it's her parents fault to let her go out like that and there she was maybe her little curls all hanging down she was depleted going along weary and nobody had anything to do with her the child and maybe a big story behind it anyhow I know one thing she heard she had read the Bible and she believed the Bible and there was was a little seed laying down in her heart she says if it ever happens I I'll know it she was predestined predestinated to that so as she heard this voice from this man bring me a drink um she knew he was a Jew uh I'm not sure how she knew that maybe just by the way he was dressed and she was a Samaritan and they just began to have a conversation she goes you know we don't have anything to do with the Jews you know and you don't have anything to do with us and uh she began so go as God was or as Jesus was speaking to her she he began to contact her spirit and um but uh brother brandom said if if you only knew who was talking to you to bring me a drink he said listen to the reply woman if you only knew who was talking to you oh my that's what it is today if you only knew who you were talking to you would ask me for a drink I'd bring you water or give you water you do not come here to draw and she began to say you know you have nothing to draw with but then he just began to tell her you know it's not this physical water I have something greater something that's Everlasting something where it's going to you know just um come bubbling out of your heart just like that spring that brother brandom talked about and so she began to have you know um something in there as you know brother brandom always says he always wants to talk to people to contact their spirit and uh so first she had a racist Spirit on her the Jews the Jews versus the Samaritans so then he began to talk to her even more and uh she had a religious spirit on her and she says you know our father Jacob dug this well so who do you think you know you are you know and and uh but Jesus be to say but whosoever drinketh of this water I shall give him I shall give him he shall never thirst but that that water I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and as she heard that brother brandom said she humbled herself to the word as she heard those words she goes give me a drink I don't want you know and the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw and as he began to contact her spirit as she humbled herself to the word now it gets down to um down deep down into her heart where no no no one would know this except God himself and the so this man said to her you know go get your husband and she said I don't have a husband and he said you you said well you know uh you have five and the one you're living with is not your husband so after six Church ages there came seven Church ages and standing before her was the Christ amen that's right that's right she and he brother bam says what happened she got all excited like this she got into distress she said sir I so being a Bible reader she said sir I believe I perceive you're a prophet and he goes and I know that when the Messiah cometh see she's expecting she's expecting for the Messiah he'll do these things what things to discern the intents of the heart he goes listen to that prostitute ill Fame woman she know more about God than half of those preachers in the United States she never said you're be elub a devil she said sir I perceive that you're a prophet now listen we know the Samaritans we know that Christ is coming we know who is called the Messiah is coming who is called the Christ's anointed one see and when he comes this will be a sign that he'll show he'll tell us these things you are a prophet but we are looking for a messiah when this Messiah comes he will tell us these things this will be his sign so her recognizing and being a Bible reader she knew about Amos 3:7 that you know all things will come to to the prophet so he began to discern our heart and um and she knew the word only comes to the prophets so she was she just thought this was just a regular man and going to be a forerunner of the coming Messiah and she expected him brother bran to say well the Messiah is coming pretty soon you know maybe in the next five years or 10 years I'm just a forerunner of him but he said I am he and as she heard those words then he called her then he called her I am he that speaks with you see she recognized it by the word of God he called her from her sins to a life and her name is in the Bible and she's got Immortal Life today he can call you the same tonight because he's the same yesterday today and forever so she began to break as she heard this these words I am he that it wasn't just a prophet it was God in flesh so now we're at the father now we're at the son dispensation God in flesh not just a prophet but it was the coming Messiah and she began to break all traditions of those days it wasn't right for a woman to go out into the street and woman of that type to talk to men but she but she's no one could stop her um someone he said try to stop her she had found something that was real and she said come see a man who told me everything that I've ever done amen that was the sign who told me everything that I've ever done and as we come so we have the father dispensation the son dispensation and now the Holy Ghost dispensation as the son of man but the same and I just want to read the the same scriptures we opened up tonight but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and you ask you know you might ask why do why do we you know got to know these certain things why do we got to know these signs and you know I just begin to think on that and I've heard this said many times but um and I was actually talking to my Grandma about all this stuff too because you know she's in a denomination and everything and she struggles with the godhead and all this and um but we were on a map or we were we were lost and we we were given a map but we didn't know where we were or where we were going but that's the true sign of a Prophet that not only does he show you where you are but he's pointing to you pointing you in the right direction amen and you say you know why why must we know these things because you know even the disciples in Jesus's time they missed the coming of John the Baptist they missed the coming of Elijah who was the Forerunner of Jesus Christ and uh that's how important these scriptures are and in Matthew 171013 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias Elijah must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall So speaking not past tense but shall future tense shall first come and restore not prepare but restore all things so it wasn't speaking that wasn't speaking of the John the Baptist because he was to prepare but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but I have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist and I just want to um kind of lay also some Foundation here of just to to prove who Malachi 44 is in in our in our day um Luke 117 um if you could actually just uh pull up Luke 117 on the screen but then everyone turn in their Bibles to Malachi 4 um 5 and 6 and this is just something that the Lord uh put or showed me not too long ago and um with everyone leaving the message and people leaving the message you know there was a Satan voice was saying out there that this coming in Malachi 4 was only to the Jews but I would just like to show something here it's kind of different but um I thought I would just do this just to it was a blessing to me so um so Luke as we read here um so everyone look at Malachi 4 um verse uh six and there's two turning of the hearts so fathers to the children put your finger on that one and the heart of the children to their fathers so put your finger on that one so now we look up at the screen here and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias Elijah and to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children now which one is that it's the first one fathers to the children so we know here by scripture that John the Baptist only fulfilled the first one this is speaking of John the Baptist when Gabriel comes to his his father so John the Baptist only fulfilled that first portion of Malachi 4 4 and5 the hearts of the fathers to the children you say you know what is the fathers to the children brother brandham said it was the old Orthodox Jews the fathers the law to that's going to a new message which was receiving the Messiah amen and then the second one the children to their to their fathers this um brother Bram said last day Children of the Kingdom going back to the Pentecostal uh original message but so you know I actually talked to a few people well no not a few but just one and there's other people who say this very same thing that this is still to the Jews and and that question was always on my mind you know and I still believe the message but I was like you know Lord you know give me something and you know brother BR says if you're not sure about something or you know just put it on the shelf and God will reveal it to you in his time so I have this marked down in my Bible and uh I just want to share it with you guys so keep your fingers on those two comings now now notice the first Elijah that was him the second was Elisha the third was John the Fourth was the seventh angel and the last Messenger to the church according to Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 now the fifth time was his Messenger to the Jews okay to the 144,000 to the Jews after the church a church is gone and brother Bron this is in the fifth seal and he goes I just feel a little funny he goes see he goes look if some thinks I want you to get this now if some still thinks that Malachi 4 to restore the the people to the same thing is going going down to those Jews and think it's the same let me just straighten you out here let me just straighten this out for you he goes just a minute see I would it would be a little bit confusing because remember Malachi 4 says return the faith of the fathers or or he's correcting himself or the children back to the father see back to the father he goes now let me show you the difference of this ministry so here's the here's the actually I'm going to open mine too here so here's the the two turning of the hearts if he comes to return so turn the heart of the fathers to the children we know that's John the Baptist so that's the law to the Messiah he goes if he comes to return the faith to the children back to the fathers he would deny Christ so if this second one was to the Jews the heart of the children it would read the heart of the children receiving the Messiah back to the law and he said he would deny Christ he would go back to the law right the fathers kept the law he goes do you get it if I had if I hadn't mentioned it it' been a little confusion to somebody but he told me to mention it so I did so I thought I would amen amen I hope everyone gets that amen that just was just a confirmation to me that that's not to the Jews that's a separate coming of Elijah because the first time the Messiah came the law they re They Crucified the Christ so if you're saying that this is to the Jews they're going back to the law which is they're going to crucify Jesus Christ again and that's just not according to scripture amen amen so as we're uh condenscending down so the father dispensation was perfect the son dispensation no he was perfect don't get me wrong but he still aged he still felt pain he had a beginning he had a father and a mother but now we're in the Holy Ghost dispensation and now God is coming down into us and just see how he slowly cond sends down amen and then um and we know the familiar scripture but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared his servants to the prophets he will be a prophet brother Braham said he will be a Vindicated as such by by God just since Jesus himself in the flesh won't be here to vindicate him as he did John it will be done by the holy spirit so that is a prophet's ministry will be attended by a great and wonderful manifestation and just coming down to my um my scripture that we opened up with behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me so the first dispensation there was a coming of the son of man coming to Abraham's tent door that was the father dispensation the second dispensation he came in flesh again God above us now God With Us knocking at the woman of the the Well's heart but now we're here in the last Church age in the Holy Ghost dispensation so it's not good enough to just have the pillar of fire above us it's not good enough to just have the man with us but God is pointing us to God wants to dwell in man amen and he's standing at the door and knocking and brother brand says but what does Jesus want what what he wants to give you something what's what's the point of not knocking that's the reason he knocks he's got something for you for you there's nothing that could be greater than he's wanting to give you the Holy Spirit he's wanting to give you eternal life it's not just some uh beggar at the door it's not just some salesman trying to sell you something um it's it's it's the Messiah himself knocking at your door trying to get in but as brother you know as we heard many times uh brother Samuel say God is a gentleman he's he's brother brandom goes through that picture of the um Jesus knocking at the door and it went through the the critics and they said Hey where's the door latch but the painter said but the door latch is inside he's a gentleman he's just knocking at your door he's not going to kick the door down but he's just patiently knocking but brother brandham said you know that knock will start real loud but as as you keep turning it down it will slowly slowly get lighter lighter and lighter and I just I just pray that you would open your heart tonight amen and I just begin to think you know um just the the profession that I'm in you know I've gone to a lot of doors and um knocking on people's doors people are expecting me to come you know what's the purpose of a visitation you know they've called us so they expecting me to come because me being a plumber there must be something wrong but what what would be the purpose of them calling let's say they have a water leak in their house and it's flooding their basement here I come knocking at the door what would be the purpose for them to just look and tell me to go away when they got when they got a problem going down in their basement water going everywhere what would be the purpose of them to tell me to leave let's say they open the door what would be the purpose of me just standing there at the front doorm and just having a conversation with them when there's a a water leak in their basement damaging all their goods damaging their Foundation sooner or later that water is going to climb and it's going to flood the whole house but what good is it for me to stay at the front door if but that's that's what God wants to do he does brother bam said said you've only he goes I've I've let I've let the Christ in into my heart brother Brandon what are you talking about preacher he goes yeah but that's all you've done he goes you've left them at the front door he goes you've accepted him as your you know personal savior but he wants to be Lord of all right amen he wants to have complete ownership he wants to be your master he wants to and brother brandham talks about many doors inside the heart you know we have we have closet doors in our house we have you know um the bedroom door we have the bathroom door we have the pantry brother brother Bram said he wants to go to every every door in your heart and brother brandham said so that was just what I mentioned he wants to be become Lord of all Lord is ruler ownership he wants to own you for you're not your own you're bought with a price he wants to take control of you so you you know you can say well I don't want to be owned by anybody well you're either going to be owned by Satan or you're going to be owned by Jesus Christ amen amen just a minute preacher I opened my heart not too long ago not too long time ago and let the Jes Let Jesus in well I'm sure happy you did that and maybe that's just what you've done open your heart and let him in but this is all you've done God wants to do something else he goes and this what really stuck out to me today is God wants to do something else he goes look look in this scripture behold I stand at the door and knock but what does he want to do he goes look here in in the scriptures I stand at the door and knock If any man will open I will come in and suck with him now it's talking about having Fellowship right come in and S with him giving something to eat or him giving you something to eat giving you that Living Water amen so I just begin to think of the the son of man um so father son now we know that the we've always heard the son of man is you know brother brandham brother brandham which I'm thankful for you know that's that was the the ministry for brother brandham everyone everyone always reads Revelations 1 through or 10 1-7 you know in the days of the voice of the seventh angel you know the mysteries of God will will be revealed and you know I'm so thankful for that tonight but we always fail to keep reading in Revelations 108 and9 it says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and he said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea and upon the earth now the messenger is gone and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up so see we're having we're having Fellowship here I will come in and Su with him so eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey you know so there's always a wrestle between the the word of God between your soul and the Flesh in Hebrews 412 for the word of God is quick powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing see the belly bitter it's piercing all the way down even to the dividing of sunder of the Soul and Spirit see it it exposes and discerns your your sins it gets you really uncomfortable this word comes to make you sacrifice when someone rubs you the wrong way um when someone you know says something to you you you your flesh wants to go after you but that that belly is bitter um and the of the joints of the marrow and the is a desera of the thoughts and intents of the heart many times we have secrets in our heart things we we don't want exposed and speaking of exposed um when I was sick a few weeks ago um I got on Edie Bisal um Kick there um somebody posted all these Services of back in 1999 brother Samuel was actually there and I could see him you know shouting and stuff but you know and uh you know it's just those those Services were just so uh a blessing to me and what what stuck out to me was um the story of the soldier boy um he began to tell that story and he and uh brother Eddie Bisal said if there's one thing that I ever learned from that trip he goes Satan hates to be exposed and that that soldier boy was committing homosexual acts but once that was exposed you know that's when he was saying I'm I'm free I'm free I'm free and that's what the word is doing it discerns the the thoughts and the intents of the heart so I just want to say to you if if you're battling something in your life you know a besetting sin something that's just coming up over over over and over in your life um I would just suggest to you like brother Eddie Bisal said to just every time someone would come up in the prayer line brother brandom said you should see their face when that Spirit knows they're about to be exposed so you know if you're just struggling with something in your life you know um I have and um I would just you know tell you to just you know expose that thing get prayer you know come to brother Samuel have me or him pray for you and um you know that way you'll be have to have a victory in your life amen and this quote um is what stuck out to me today uh I stand at the door and knock now get yourself in a condition pull that heart open say Jesus if I if ever you worked on me my heart do it now get all the unbelief out let me wake up here shake myself is it true that I've passed over something all these years and missed it I've been closed up oh yes I know you're with me but I have but have I Let You in everywhere have I Let You in everywhere to see you amen and and that that last phrase there really stuck out to me goes but have I Let You in everywhere to see you so you may have left them at the front door and that's why you know you may struggle with your life and you know say you know I have I have God in my heart but you know every time you know you know um a trial comes my way you know this temper flares up or you know this temptation flares up you know and I I keep seeing my Humanity I keep seeing Brian I keep seeing Brian in this door I you know I keep seeing Brian in this door but brother Bram says but I have you let him in everywhere so if you let him in in all your doors um brother brandom goes through a lot of them like Pride um what's are the other ones here um Pride private life you know Faith having faith in other things and not uh you know the Lord Jesus Christ private life what are you doing in your private life at home you know our you know in the in the marriage supper of the Lamb brother brandham and brother Samuel even brought it out a few Services ago or last service he goes we just put on church he goes it's like false teeth or a false arm or a false leg you come to church you know with a big old smile on your face you know God bless you you know you know but you go home and you take you take your teeth out and you know wasn't that a good sherish you know so so that that's your private life but it's not connected it's not connected with you amen and that's that's what God doesn't want God doesn't want anything fake he wants something real amen so every time something comes up a test or a trial I I just want to see Jesus Christ everywhere in my life I don't want to see Brian I want to let him in every door amen and brother brandham gives this challenge in the message the trials the musicians can come just play something softly brother Bram says I challenge you let's all stand I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man and human flesh through the bride's body accept his call it's not just good to have God above us it's not good enough to have God with us but the only way you're going to make the Rapture is to have God dwelling inside of you that is the son of man the son of man wasn't just for brandom brother brandham but it's it's come in a many membered bride body amen and then John 14:12 it says verily verily I say unto you you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father Jesus says I come from my father he came as a spirit he was a Spirit came from his father into flesh now he went to back to spirit amen but he came to dwell in in his bride amen and I just want to challenge you tonight to believe that you keep you know you keep seeing yourself and all your mistakes but have you really opened up every door in your heart tonight I just pray that that spoke something to you have you left your lord and savior savior at the front door and um it's a a crucial time um The Rapture I believe the Rapture I don't know I I just got a strong burden last Thursday I just was praying for people because I know it's it's going home time amen and I don't want to be like Sarah I don't want to be looking at things of the world I want to be looking for him amen every part of my life and uh I've been through a lot I mean I know we all have but just my personal testimony um you know if you have a besetting sin you know just expose that thing do whatever you got to do you know CU time is running out friends it's you know that door is wide open but one of these days it's it's going to close and that knock starts off real strong and brother brandham says you know one day it'll it'll completely stop and uh the marriage supper of the land sorry I'm just real thankful for this [Applause] message I don't want to see anyone lost I don't want to be there on that day looking for you I want to see you I want to hug you and say we made it amen I just pray you would open your heart tonight and I know the times are dark you may be going through a test or a trial but he's here amen and that's what brother bram's message has done is declare he's here here amen just receive him tonight and as brother Samuel would come let's just bow our heads Lord I'm just so thankful Lord for you for this message lord it's it's help me see you lord hallu it's helped me die Lord You've Lifted Me Up Lord Jesus and all the times I failed and hurt people Lord You've forgiven me Lord and You Raised Me Up Lord to preach your word father I had many dreams many things I wanted to do but Lord you had a greater calling father and Lord I believe you have a greater calling for each and everyone here tonight they may not be a preacher they may not be a song leader but Lord you want to dwell in them and walk in their flesh Lord as if you were physically here Lord Jesus in your Corporal body which you are in your bride Lord and Lord we just want to give you our all father I just pray Lord if there's someone here that doesn't have their all their doors open to you Lord I just pray Lord you would help them surrender Lord not leave at the front door Lord with dirty feet Lord and hungry you want to come in in Fellowship you want to come in and make yourself known Lord and take us in a Rapture one day Lord we're looking for that day Lord that's the goal Lord is just to see you face to face Lord and bow before you Lord and said it was worth it all Lord we know you're here we know you're moving amongst us Lord and I just pray spoke something to somebody's heart tonight father Lord just move tonight father Lord and bless your people father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I

Lord you are all I ever needed come and make me oh pour your spirit out on me feel just like the rain oh saturate my perfect s and fall aresh on me yes Lord Lord build my cup again he my heart heal my heart and make [Music] me for I Need You Now pour your spirit [Music] out you know it was wonderful tonight the Lord spoke to us am you know the things that brother Brian read that quote to start out with I I love that how the brother Brown had mentioned that in that meeting he said brother Brown if they can only see it then get into it you know it's it's just like when they troubled the water the angel an angel of the Lord would come down and Trouble the water at a certain season the Bible said they didn't know when it was going to happen they just had to be ready and when you think about it that the man himself that the Lord Jesus came to the same one who sent every Angel yes the same one who had touched so many came to this man who was there you you have to wonder and because you know in your own self that how often that that man must have thought as he told the Lord Jesus every time I'm getting ready to get in somebody gets in ahead of me but there was an expectation that he had in his heart for he knew I need to be touched by the Lord so he knew he was in the right place and how that God came and found him right where he was at I don't know there's when brother Brian was bringing that out about Sarah tonight and about the woman at the well reading those thoughts just exactly how brother Ram described Sarah in that message is anything too hard for the Lord if you think about it the on the road to Emmas as well we think so many times that it would be as though that our thoughts and our questions would push him away but yet when he comes what was a key point is that woman at the well humbled herself when she recognized she was willing to lay aside all of her thoughts all of her ideas same way on the road to EMAs same way with Sarah they were willing to lay aside everything and humble themselves and you know I believe with all my heart heart how the Lord has spoke to us once again here tonight the greatest thing that we can have is to Tabernacle the Living God and the prophet would make a statement like this in deity of Jesus Christ and say that many people he said as the Holy Ghost has been received but they think it's only church joining but he said God it's actually tabernacling deity you see it's it's taking what has come into your life and allow him to go deeper allow him to move deeper in your life allowing to move through every door you know the first door that he comes to is that door of Pride it's exactly right brother brah says he wants to humiliate us amen wants to get us to where our will is surrender to him now I don't I don't know about you I I actually early one Saturday morning actually we didn't even get to bed it was after the last I don't think it was the last youth meeting that I had I'm not sure but I get a Benjamin comes upstairs and thank the Lord he was still up at that time and said hey we got a problem in the basement and um well my wife and I worked because I didn't want to call and get him up at that time of the night but then he came over and like he said what what good would it have done to left leave him on the front door when I called called him ask him I was out front I had a shovel cuz I knew where the cleanout was I I wanted to see what was going on because of what I just had to clean up I wanted to know where is this at and I I can tell you friends that's where we want to invite him in in every area of our life that's what every area every door make sure that you haven't just invited him and he's just on the door step as Savior but let him be the Lord of every area of your life I like how brother Shane put it in his testimony at the last youth meeting he said you know he said when God got a hold of my life and I surrendered he said there is a savior he said I invited him into the door of Music invited him in the door of entertainment invited him to every door in my life and allow him to come down and God begin to move and in every channel in every area I tell you that's one thing that we can say here tonight is Lord I need more of you we don't want to miss our day of visitation you know to me when I hear a message like this I I don't listen to a message any message I don't know how many times I go over and over the same message sometimes before as I'm ministering but to me it just comes out more personal every time of what God's desire to do is to live his own life through us that's God's desire and it just just requires us yielding brother Brian brought that out of being just just allowing the spirit of God and be open with God say Lord I've got this I've got this besetting sin I have this in my life Lord I need your deliverance that's why God God he is so mindful to every single need in our life I want to be that's how I want to live don't you a total
