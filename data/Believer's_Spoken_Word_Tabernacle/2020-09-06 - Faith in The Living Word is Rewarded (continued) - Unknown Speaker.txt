TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to bring that out right there god bless you all [Applause] brother stood right here and testified about how the enemy wanted to put that over him you can't you look at you're still doing this still doing that said the cigarettes and this and that but one day can i preach it wasn't the man preaching that did it it was jesus christ right there he came right to where you were at and there was a settling he was no longer it was nicotine patches preach brother samuel they want nicotine patches [Music] [Applause] he needed more than a patch he needed somebody to span [Applause] [Music] but these are real these are testimonies right here where the enemy at the enemy i say that this is a testimony for you to look at and say wait a minute the devil wanted to run it down and discourage them but look what god did god came and he drew him right back like we get a phone call or was it a monday or whatever sister amanda's on the phone and then i talked with brother and yawning in my notes but here we go to talk to him on the phone and here they start coming he didn't listen to him it didn't drop right away right but aaron was still battling on but what it was it was a supernatural god he could not get away from a god that had touched his life right there in blue sky where we had a prayer meeting he knew there's a living god there's a real god god came down and god did the work in that life that's a testimony where you can stand and say you might look at your life and say i still got this and i still got that but don't you make allowances for it say i'm gonna stand upon this word i want jesus christ to be so identified in my life amen hallelujah whosoever be ashamed of me and of my words in this generation my words in this generation living word whoever's ashamed of it he said i'll be ashamed of you amen because this word is him well if i lived in the days of noah you'd be standing with christ today remember if i was back there with peter you'd be standing with christ today let me just tell you right now you'd be standing with brother branham the prophet [Applause] the messenger and the message are one in the same way hallelujah don't everybody's getting nervous you gonna call me out next i didn't have it on my heart to even think i didn't think about that but god god wanted that there's somebody here that needed that amen there's somebody here that needed that or maybe that will stream this service somebody needed that somebody that maybe is at the point of saying what's the use you're about ready to echo what the devil is trying to whisper to you but let me tell you something what you see is not the strength of man and a woman you see the strength of god taking hold on that life all they had to do was surrender to the power that was dealing with their life to bring them across that dividing line the greeks came to jesus they came to philip we want to see jesus they came and they looked at him they heard about him they heard about him remember what are greeks they're given to wisdom what paul said they got to figure everything out wisdom and figure it all out they looked at him he's just a man you're right he is a man but it's what's behind the man it was god in the man brother bram said what it was it was god in the form of man he said now be real careful right here he's the same yesterday today and forever god came in the form of jesus christ to redeem us are you with me god borrowed the form of william branham to come and deliver the word to you and i yeah while the rest of the world said he just like any other preacher he just like any other man miracles oh you know listen my dad was my dad preached back in pentecost i wasn't i don't wasn't alive i don't remember that time but my dad when he came to the message this was not the first time he saw miracles but there were miracles and when dad would go around and preaching you know 10 20 nights straight going around throughout the hills and preaching revivals he saw people getting up off of bed saw cops now i understand what i'm trying to say is that there was something that was greater than just signs and wonders there was a longing inside of my dad's heart he knew there's more he began to see there's things that's not right in that of the organization it was a longing that was on the inside of him it was longing for the word [Applause] don't misunderstand me like i said on thursday night there ain't never been another ministry that's been close to the ministry of brother branham i'm just trying to tell you signs and miracles and wonders that is not in itself what caught benny and for some that's all they saw they never caught the revelation of who it was so when somebody else rose up on miracles followed it's to recognize jesus christ to recognize this word that god would deliver to our lives and still notice what jesus said just bring this down here jesus said except a corn of wheat right fall into the ground die in a bottle alone he was not only speaking to them and letting them know of the mystery of god the outpouring of the holy spirit that would move down how that from that one from that one seed that would come forth the life to water the other seeds it was much it was more than that brother brandon picks that up an unwrangling of god he said the word was speaking to them for their life except you die you abide alone all right you see it's a terrible condition to be alone sometimes you can be in the midst of a crowded gathering and you feel walking down malls or wherever they're called nowadays whatever you can walk all the way and walk around there you're not there with your friend or somebody serving the lord with you wife husband so forth he feels all alone because there's other people that's there but you need something deeper there's a deeper fellowship than just people amen you could have your wife or you could have your husband but there's something about it when you're connected you have somebody who shares the same desire that you share that's where you can find fellowship are you with me you can you can walk down through there and you can feel all alone but the thing that jesus was trying to let him know if you don't die die to yourself die to your own thoughts die to your own ideas you remain alone but with that death it makes a way now how can we get there we can't on our own that's right are you with me it isn't that you know that that jesus comes comes down i'm gonna borrow you for a minute it isn't that jesus comes down and goes like this and says come on paul i want you to come up here with me come up here with me once you come up here with me you're going to come and go with me jesus is not a wrestler well i got your shirt all wet man but this is what he does hey i've been noticing you there's some things that there's a desire i see within you i see within your life you say that's right he starts getting closer finally he says you want that desire to become a reality in your life come follow me give me your hand and he leads us into the place amen of life thank you so don't mistake it when when god is speaking and there's things that he's dealing with sometimes it seems like oh that's very harsh or this is calling out it ain't god is angry with you god's putting the devil on notice you can't have my son you can't have my daughter you know what he's calling out there's something within you he's calling out to that character that's on the inside there's a character that he wants to express all of our strength all of our struggles will never express it but when he comes he's the one that brings forth that character that's down on the inside he leads us out amen i'm going to read this because the holy spirit had me put this down yesterday this is the same longing that rises in the heart of the believer when the comforter is revealing himself to be the same god today that i am your satisfier i am your thirst quencher i am your desire i am the fountain of life that transforms your life from a dry parched ground of barrenness to a place lush with the glory of god i am your portion i am your sustainer i am your keeper i am your deliverer i am your peace i am your god and you are my child let me come fully in and you shall know that i am in the father and the father in me and i in you and you in me i am [Applause] he leads us to the fountain of living water he is that fountain of living water if any man believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall floor rivers of living amen lord jesus i spoke lord just as you've given it to me here my lips my heart even examples that you've had to stand examples you've taken now lord i'm asking the lord for these hearts that are gathered here this morning lord i pray that you would just move down for them in a special way lord it's not what we can explain but it's your presence coming right down here among us living god making yourself known to that heart lord what you have spoken i'm your satisfier i'm your deliverer i'm your portion what i pray right now that heart dear god that desires to say lord they might have husband wife they might have friends but they feel all alone but there's a comforter and there's only one only one husband can give us comfort wife can give us comfort mom can give us comfort dad can give us comfort but we need a greater comforter than that we need the comforter now lord i pray you gave an example right here you don't put us in a headlock no you don't force us your presence has come you've touched many hearts even as they said here in these services and have said hearing services their hearts and their lives have been touched by your presence that's so that they would know this is not a man's word they would realize that there's a greater one that's here they would recognize lord the one that i stand and represent and i preach about the same one who changed my life they realized lord god we're not speaking of some historical event we're talking about a living god we're talking about the i am that i am now lord may they be like that of the bed melech there's some standing right here they made a decision [Music] faith in the living word is always rewarded i pray heavenly father if thou they've heard and seen was a man i pray that god you'd help them right now i believe lord this morning you've given grace may they recognize lord god it's more than a man my hands are the same as their hands the chemicals i'm made out of other brothers and sisters same 84 cents worth but that's not what'll do it it's to recognize who's in our midst it's to recognize say lord be exalted in my life lord i ask right now god may lord the hearts the lord you may tender by your spirit i pray lord god in that life right now may it be god a real declaration to say lord i surrender all i'll give it all to you lord i'm not gonna hold nothing back i don't want the holy ghost added to my life i want to surrender my life lord i want you to take all of me [Music] it's the one that want to be remembered in prayer i can pray for you and i believe god will hear my prayer god bless you i believe god will hear my prayer but it ain't what i believe it ain't because of me but i believe with all my heart that he's here it's whether you believe or not he's here to minister to your need let's go to him when i'm praying whatever the need is upon your heart [Music] whatever that need is i want you to make that known before him if there's anything about it in your life that would hinder that would hinder that from coming about if you know if there's anything at all in your life right now just settle and say lord really settle and say lord forgive me lord i don't want to be i don't want that in my life forgive me lord jesus let it be a real repentance and watch him come maybe there's something you've been dealing with and you're saying god i need a change to come in my life you're one of me you want to be identified say lord change me lord you promised in your word from glory unto glory god bless your hands [Music] this isn't a formality of a service but i believe it's the grace of god that gives us an opportunity to respond to his word [Music] you know god said in the book of jeremiah from his heart he said i've corrected my children but they haven't received my correction i believe as his children we want to receive his correction we want to move in that word we want to forsake our own thoughts forsake our own ideas oh my heavenly father i think of these moments lord the very sacred and solemn moments that were gathered here we've come here this morning lord we mean business we know lord this isn't about just coming and fulfilling a duty no we've come here lord we want to hear from you the lord jesus their hands that have went up throughout this building but i'm asking lord god that behind those hands as they lord are in prayer lord there was there's something more they defied gravity to raise that hand there was something an impulse your prophet tells us like this he said the angels are right there right where we're sitting and it's the angels that move upon us and say raise your hand respond to the word lord i believe with all my heart that the angels of god your prophet call them ushers they're here you're here the lord for these hearts right here they want something more than just an emotion they don't want just a feeling they don't want just an emotion you know lord god what's behind that hand there's hands that went up lord that they want to really surrender their life they want to sell it right here this morning they want to let it all be ended right here they're tired of walking alone they desired that the comforter would come to them lord god and make his abode in their life now i asked lord jesus but you would move lord god for those hearts right now may they recognize that that promise belongs to them may they see lord god that the holy ghost it was made available for them knowing that they would be here and they would be desiring of it lord god you made a way that they could receive it oh lord god even lord when they lord would be down lord downcast in their spirit downcast in their mind but lord you made a way lord god that you would come you would sweep by that heart lord you would inspire their hearts lord god to reach up and say lord god i will lay everything on the line lord god i want you lord jesus [Music] lord i pray they made that stand [Music] lord your word is true you've never had to take it back and you won't take it back your word is true repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and not maybe not perhaps you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and as many as are far off as many as the lord i got you lord that apostolic age is still in session you're still calling to hearts and lies i pray heavenly father may you lord just continue to move in our hearts this message lord it goes beyond just reaching lord for souls you've you've reached for souls in each one of these services god i wonder here in this service [Music] i wonder if we forgot the voice that spoke to us it's promised us deliverance we hear everything around us taking place we see everything going on as jeremiah would relate of it in the book of lamentations but i pray god may it be from within our hearts to say lord i want to give place to the voice of god lord let me be so tuned in on your voice that it drowns out every other voice let my life lord let my character be molded [Music] now he's talking to us it's already crossed the line been born of the spirit of god let my character be molded god give me the grace that i need through every test and every trial help me lord to die more to myself as paul would say i die daily [Music] let that life let it flow freely about as a husband as a father mother wife young person say lord be lifted up in my life i don't want my ideas to be the forefront i want you lord jesus [Music] i want you to leave my home you to lead the family i want you to direct the sword grant lord help us lord to find our place help us to remain help us to be steadfast in all things lord god as we're trusting in you in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] don't you love you [Music] he's just so just so precious you know sometimes after a service and sometimes after a time sometimes a person can walk and say i didn't get anything don't say that don't say that it's not true the reality is is if there is one thing listen to me simeon had a visitation of the holy ghost and it said you'll not die until you see the lord's christ he didn't see the lord's christ that day but he had a revelation you're not gonna die till you see the lord's christ brother samuel what did that do when god speaks to your heart it puts an expectation in your heart for him amen and that's who it is that we're looking for that's who it is we're expecting that's who it is we're giving ourselves to that's who it is we're pouring our lives out to him it's him he's a real living god he's the same yesterday today and forever amen let's see let's just worship the lord right now let's just worship him you're praying you keep on praying and seeking the lord if you want prayer we'll be glad to pray with you but this is a time even
