[35:50] I was messaging him I said my only
[35:52] regret is that I'm not with you he said
[35:54] man I wish you were with me too
[35:57] but maybe next year
[36:00] Luke the 24th chapter in the first verse
[36:03] now upon the first day of the week very
[36:05] early in the morning they came unto the
[36:07] Sepulcher bringing the spices which they
[36:09] had prepared and certain others with
[36:10] them and they found the stone rolled
[36:12] away from the Sepulcher and they entered
[36:15] in and found not the body of the Lord
[36:16] Jesus and it came to pass as they were
[36:19] much perplexed there about behold two
[36:21] men stood by them in shining garments
[36:23] and as they were afraid and bowed down
[36:25] their faces to the Earth they said unto
[36:27] them why seek ye the living among the
[36:30] Dead
[36:31] he is not here but is risen remember how
[36:35] he spake unto you when he was yet in
[36:37] Galilee saying the son of man must be
[36:39] delivered into the hands of sinful men
[36:41] and be crucified and the third day rise
[36:44] again and they remembered his words and
[36:47] returned from the Sepulcher and told all
[36:49] these things into the eleven and to all
[36:51] the rest
[36:52] it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and
[36:54] Mary the mother of James and other women
[36:57] that were with him was told these things
[36:59] unto the apostles
[37:01] and their words seemed to them as Idol
[37:03] tales and they believed them not amen
[37:06] may God bless his word tonight you may
[37:08] be seated
[37:10] I uh
[37:16] get in my way
[37:18] praise the Lord
[37:19] but we we find this familiar text here
[37:23] uh that we would we would hear probably
[37:25] most on the Easter message or something
[37:29] to that effect of of them coming to the
[37:31] Sepulcher but we just want to for a few
[37:33] minutes I don't want to take too much
[37:34] time but for a few minutes just speak on
[37:36] this subject of why seek ye a living God
[37:40] amongst the Dead
[37:42] and we find here in this text that that
[37:44] these were Faithful Servants of the Lord
[37:46] that came came to where he last was
[37:49] expecting to find him and they came to
[37:52] do him a service expecting where they
[37:54] last saw him but he wasn't he wasn't
[37:56] there
[37:57] and a lot of people will go to church
[37:59] and they will go through their
[38:00] traditions and they will go about their
[38:02] regular day-to-day and expect to find
[38:04] God where they last saw him but God's
[38:07] never standing in one place God's always
[38:09] on the Move he's always he's always
[38:11] moving forward he's only got one One
[38:13] Direction and that's forward and so he's
[38:15] always on the move and they they came to
[38:17] him out of good hearts and they came to
[38:19] him wanting to do him a service but they
[38:22] came looking for him in the wrong place
[38:24] I think that if they would have listened
[38:26] to what he said they would have realized
[38:27] he wouldn't have been there because he
[38:29] told them if you destroy this temple in
[38:31] three days I'll raise it up right so he
[38:33] already told him I'm not going to be
[38:34] here when you come to look for me so
[38:36] don't look for me in a cemetery but look
[38:39] for me out walking and talking among men
[38:41] in flesh and so they find themselves
[38:43] wanting to do God a service and you know
[38:45] we we put ourselves a little bit in
[38:47] their shoes that they found that they're
[38:49] the one that they believed was the
[38:51] Messiah they watched him get crucified
[38:52] and they watched him get beaten and
[38:54] bruised and I just the sight that they
[38:57] must have seen and and just shaking you
[38:59] know just shaking to see that take place
[39:01] and and they just wanted to to bring
[39:04] some anointing and some and some spices
[39:06] to his body and they wanted to go do a
[39:08] service for him and I think that's how
[39:10] many hearted people are they just want
[39:12] to do a service for the Lord I think
[39:14] anybody that's sitting in the church
[39:15] anywhere around the world they would say
[39:17] I just want to do something for the Lord
[39:19] I want to do something uh that would be
[39:21] pleasing unto him but we've got to
[39:23] recognize where he's at to do this
[39:26] service for him thank God we have a true
[39:29] word in this hour that tells us exactly
[39:31] where he's at in this age and how to
[39:34] approach him and the only way to
[39:36] approach him that we can do a service
[39:38] for him I thank God that we're not just
[39:40] a Wandering church and tradition
[39:42] wondering where he's at but we know
[39:44] exactly where he's at and we know
[39:46] exactly how to approach him thank God
[39:48] tonight I believe that the services are
[39:51] just the way that the prophet said was
[39:52] pleasing unto the Lord we sing songs and
[39:54] we worshiped him to the Lord and we gave
[39:57] our part and our offering and he's made
[39:59] a promise that he would come and he
[40:01] would be here with us and I believe he
[40:03] keeps his word every time and I believe
[40:05] he's here in our midst because we
[40:07] followed uh not our tradition but out of
[40:10] belief that he honors his program right
[40:13] and so they find themselves going to
[40:15] look for God according to their program
[40:18] and they should have known he's not
[40:19] among dead things he's life right and
[40:21] life and death cannot dwell together you
[40:23] can't have one and the other together in
[40:25] the same place but it's either death or
[40:28] it's life and so they go look for him in
[40:30] a cemetery and they find that the
[40:32] Stone's already been rolled away and
[40:33] they find that he's not in there and of
[40:35] course we're every Christian's familiar
[40:37] with the story of Resurrection but where
[40:40] are we in this story
[40:42] and so these Faithful Servants come to
[40:44] come to the tomb and they find two
[40:45] angels there right and there's two
[40:47] angels and Shining garments they say
[40:49] he's not here but he's already risen and
[40:51] so there's two angels that are are to be
[40:54] to the cemetery right they were already
[40:56] in the cemetery but there was a third
[40:58] Angel already on the earth that was
[41:00] walking on the road to Emmaus and that's
[41:02] the angel that we're looking for right
[41:04] that's the office of God that we want to
[41:06] be with we're not in the cemetery we're
[41:09] looking for the Melchizedek right we're
[41:10] not looking for the two angels to Sodom
[41:12] we're Abraham and we're looking for
[41:15] Melchizedek right so they came to the
[41:17] Sepulcher looking for him and those two
[41:19] angels told him hey you're called to be
[41:21] higher he's not here but he's risen over
[41:24] there he's talking with the disciples
[41:26] even now he's walking with him and they
[41:28] found themselves uh in in disbelief
[41:32] the Bible says they were perplexed which
[41:34] is which is baffled or extremely puzzled
[41:37] that that he wasn't in there but yet
[41:39] they heard where he would be and when it
[41:40] came time to find him they were
[41:42] surprised that they were he wasn't where
[41:45] they thought he'd be they were surprised
[41:47] to say that he that to see that he
[41:49] actually keeps his word and he's walking
[41:51] and talking and he came out of the Tomb
[41:53] and he's no longer bound in those grave
[41:56] clothes but he's out walking I could
[41:58] just put myself in their shoes thinking
[42:00] well I watched I watched them carry his
[42:02] body in here I watched them roll away
[42:05] the stone and I I thought there'd be no
[42:07] way when I came here and the stones
[42:08] rolled away I thought well where's the
[42:09] Lord it seems like they've lost him we
[42:12] lost track of where the Lord is and I
[42:14] think religion today has lost track of
[42:16] where the Lord is they put it all in the
[42:18] in the buildings and in the chandeliers
[42:21] and in the in the in the fanciness of
[42:23] the world or they put it into into the
[42:25] the treasury Department of their church
[42:27] or they put it in all other things but
[42:30] they've lost sight of where the Lord is
[42:32] today but thank God we have a revelation
[42:34] in this hour that we know exactly where
[42:37] he's at today he's not a far out
[42:39] somewhere but he's here in a living
[42:42] assembly a living place where we are
[42:45] alive and made well it's the Breath of
[42:47] God in us that makes us live right it's
[42:50] the Breath of God that in us that that
[42:52] we can even be here today and it's him
[42:54] it's testifying of his power in our life
[42:57] it's him it's it's God but why would we
[43:00] look for him somewhere else why would we
[43:01] look for him in theology or in in uh in
[43:04] a man-made book but we've got to look in
[43:07] his book to know where he's at
[43:09] and so to build a foundation here we're
[43:11] not looking at a dead God we're looking
[43:14] at an alive God we don't want a dead God
[43:17] we want an alive God the religions all
[43:19] over the world serving dead God that
[43:21] they're waiting for some action to
[43:23] happen right we could go to the
[43:24] muhammadans and they're waiting for the
[43:26] resurrection of their prophet and
[43:28] they're waiting for something right and
[43:30] they're waiting for that God to rise up
[43:32] and we go to another place and uh I've
[43:34] been to India and they're they're
[43:36] waiting for the cycle of their godship
[43:38] to come around so they can be at another
[43:41] level when they come back you know and
[43:43] it's a sad thing there because they
[43:45] don't even recognize the value of a of a
[43:47] human soul they they put it somehow
[43:50] lower than an animal or you know if you
[43:52] come and you're a human but you're a
[43:54] beggar or per person you're less than
[43:56] than the the pig or the cow or the or
[43:59] the ant and then you come back again and
[44:01] you know the highest order of that of
[44:03] that life cycle there is a priest
[44:06] in India and I wonder who wrote that law
[44:09] who wrote the law that a priesthood
[44:11] would be the highest when the Bible says
[44:13] the exact opposite that the priests are
[44:15] servants unto men and we're to be the
[44:17] lowest among all of them and we're to
[44:19] serve men with all our life right so
[44:22] they've they've perverted God's word and
[44:24] to say if you just keep waiting and look
[44:26] at the cycle of death that they're in
[44:28] that they're waiting to come back again
[44:30] and come back again the muhammadas are
[44:32] waiting for for him to come back again
[44:34] but thank God we serve a resurrected
[44:37] Christ that has already come back again
[44:39] and he's not to die again but he's alive
[44:42] and well and living among men to do the
[44:45] same works that he did when he was
[44:47] already here right thank God we're not
[44:49] just wondering if we one day he's going
[44:52] to come back or one day there's going to
[44:53] be a Revival or one day there's going to
[44:55] be we live in the age where all things
[44:57] are revealed all things are open unto us
[45:00] the word is open unto us the Revival is
[45:03] open unto us Christ is alive in us we're
[45:06] not waiting for it it's right now so
[45:09] we're not looking for something to come
[45:10] it's already come Elias has already come
[45:14] amongst the bride and is doing the same
[45:16] works that he did back then I believe we
[45:19] make of that part of the body where God
[45:21] is performing his word the same way by
[45:24] the same results by the same power
[45:26] through the same word in US
[45:29] we're not looking for him out there in
[45:31] the cemetery but Jeremiah was saying but
[45:33] the Lord is the true God he is the
[45:36] Living God somebody say Living God and
[45:38] an everlasting King at his wrath the
[45:41] Earth shall tremble and the nation shall
[45:43] not be able to abide his indignation
[45:45] he's the Living God
[45:47] not a god of history but a living God
[45:51] Amen brother man was saying on that
[45:53] Resurrection Resurrection Morning Glory
[45:55] Hallelujah Matthew the great writer
[45:57] after he was resurrected from the dead
[45:59] the Old Testament Saints and many of
[46:01] those that slept in the dust of the
[46:02] Earth come up out of the grave and
[46:04] entered into the City and appeared unto
[46:06] many that quickening power still on them
[46:09] bones of Elijah when there wasn't no
[46:12] more bones
[46:13] still on job there wasn't a spoonful of
[46:15] dust left of his body but the quickening
[46:18] power was still there
[46:21] so we find that that life is not just
[46:23] our body
[46:24] or it's not just necessarily the breath
[46:26] but it's a quickening power
[46:29] job was what 4 000 years before this 3
[46:33] 000 years before this there wasn't a
[46:34] spoonful of his body left brother Brian
[46:36] but there was a quickening power upon
[46:38] him that he knew that a redeemer would
[46:41] come he knew that there would be a
[46:43] resurrection that would come and it
[46:44] didn't matter if he went by the grave or
[46:46] by the sea or by the fire or whatever
[46:48] happened to his literal body but that
[46:50] quickening power that was within him
[46:52] would be resurrected you would not find
[46:55] job in a cemetery you would find him
[46:57] waiting for the resurrection to be
[46:59] called that his name could come forth
[47:01] and I believe any bride member that's
[47:03] gone on before us is waiting the same
[47:06] place that Joe was waiting that their
[47:08] name could be called and it doesn't
[47:09] matter what happened to their literal
[47:11] body or these bones or just dust put
[47:13] together but where is the spirit of that
[47:16] quickening power laying it's waiting for
[47:18] us the voice of the Resurrection to call
[47:21] forward that the resurrection could come
[47:23] again so the same Works being done by
[47:26] the same word through this bride what he
[47:30] did you shall do also he called on a
[47:32] resurrection we call on a resurrection
[47:35] he called on the saints that had passed
[47:37] before we will call on the saints that
[47:39] have passed before that quickening power
[47:41] still holds even on a spoonful of dust
[47:44] when their name is called that
[47:46] quickening power responds in its
[47:49] resurrection power again and I believe
[47:51] we're not waiting for it to come but
[47:53] it's here right now I believe just any
[47:55] moment any morning I believe that that
[47:58] voice will be wrong and I believe it'll
[48:00] be recognized and I believe the faith
[48:02] that was once delivered to the Saints is
[48:04] back in the church and they will say
[48:06] it's time for the resurrection to come
[48:09] on and I believe we'll see loved ones
[48:11] walk through the door and I believe
[48:12] there'll be knocks at the door and I
[48:14] believe those that have gone on before
[48:15] us will come back and say it's time
[48:18] you called it I'm here I believe that's
[48:21] what happened when Lazarus was passed on
[48:23] and Jesus came to his tomb and he called
[48:25] him brother bam said he called him by
[48:26] name otherwise there would have been a
[48:28] whole Resurrection take place but he had
[48:30] to call him by his name Lazarus come
[48:34] forth and he came out out of the grave
[48:35] and I I believe it looks something like
[48:37] this where Lazarus went down to the
[48:39] Grave he was already dead his body had
[48:41] already sunken in and he was there
[48:42] fellowshipping with the Saints in
[48:44] Paradise that had already passed on
[48:45] before
[48:47] and he's having a conversation with
[48:49] those that have passed on and he's
[48:50] talking to Ezekiel and Isaiah and all
[48:52] the great prophets that had passed on
[48:54] he's saying there's a there's a redeemer
[48:56] on the earth now if he's he's here and
[48:58] if he's here it means it's just a matter
[49:00] of time and we'll be resurrected he
[49:03] began to have a testimony service on the
[49:05] other side and I believe he began to
[49:06] witness the power of Jesus Christ
[49:09] because they knew there was one coming
[49:10] Isaiah had seen it and it testified
[49:13] about it but Lazarus went down as an
[49:15] eyewitness to say he's here
[49:17] he's here he's walking and talking he's
[49:21] walking on the earth even now the
[49:22] Miracles he's performing the countenance
[49:24] of God all around him his glory has come
[49:27] to Earth again and I believe as he began
[49:30] to give that testimony there was an old
[49:31] an old man come up from the back and I
[49:34] believe he said what's that now you say
[49:36] that he's here he said yeah the the
[49:37] Redeemer is here he said glory to God I
[49:40] saw him I saw him thousands of years ago
[49:43] I said I know my redeemer will live you
[49:46] mean to tell me that the time is now
[49:48] that he's here Lazarus said oh yes he's
[49:50] here right about that time I believe the
[49:52] voice rang through the eternities and it
[49:54] said Lazarus come forth my with that
[49:57] Lazarus disappeared back but what was
[49:59] taking place in Paradise there was an
[50:01] Earnest expectation in those saints that
[50:04] had gone on before to say he's walking
[50:05] on the Earth
[50:07] in just a few days job's name would be
[50:09] called in the resurrection and he would
[50:11] walk again knowing his Redeemer in the
[50:14] power of his resurrection I believe
[50:16] we're just a couple days away now I
[50:18] believe the saints that have gone on
[50:20] here from us are testifying the the
[50:22] opening of the word is here Christ is on
[50:25] the earth the Miracles those signs that
[50:27] he did he's doing again I believe just
[50:30] in a few minutes the resurrection will
[50:32] be on I believe that's the that's the
[50:34] hope that's the faith of the Bride in
[50:36] this hour that we're not facing death
[50:38] but we're just a nether phase into
[50:40] another Journey
[50:42] those that have passed on before are not
[50:44] in death they're just waiting for their
[50:46] name to be called
[50:48] they're just sleeping waiting waiting
[50:52] what are they waiting for you and I to
[50:55] come to a position in the word that they
[50:57] without us cannot be made perfect they
[51:00] cannot continue on into their Journey
[51:02] without us they'll walk back through
[51:04] that door said I waited for you to call
[51:06] I waited for you to call my name and the
[51:09] power of the church in this hour is
[51:11] ready for the anointing of God to say
[51:13] all things are made ready now let the
[51:16] Resurrection come the voice of the
[51:18] Resurrection is in the bride it's in her
[51:21] mouth under her messenger she is the
[51:23] final voice to the final age that she
[51:26] can be the restoration of all things
[51:28] it's Christ in her the same resurrection
[51:31] power right it's that quickening power
[51:34] that comes upon Him Romans 8 was saying
[51:36] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[51:38] because of sin but the spirit is life
[51:40] because of righteousness but if the
[51:42] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[51:44] the dead dwell in you
[51:46] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[51:49] shall also somebody say also
[51:52] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[51:55] that dwelleth in you
[51:58] if brother Graham says if
[52:00] that same spirit
[52:02] so there's one thing that we need to
[52:04] make sure of while we still have breath
[52:06] in our lungs it's that that same Spirit
[52:09] also dwells in us the same resurrection
[52:12] power also dwells in us so we don't want
[52:15] to leave that to chance or to wonder but
[52:18] let it be known that that same Spirit
[52:19] somebody say also
[52:21] dwells in us the same resurrection power
[52:25] that quickened him from the dead shall
[52:27] also Quicken us now remember we're not
[52:30] looking for a dead God in a cemetery
[52:32] somewhere so it's nice to go remember
[52:34] our loved ones and we just passed the
[52:36] anniversary of some passing of our loved
[52:38] ones and go to the grave and pay our
[52:40] respects and it's something to do out of
[52:42] memory but they're not there that's not
[52:44] where they are that people come from all
[52:46] over the world to come visit the the
[52:47] graveside of brother Branham to maybe
[52:49] get some dirt or get some anointing from
[52:51] it he's not even in there if they knew
[52:53] what he said they would not come looking
[52:56] for him there they would know that the
[52:59] same spirit that was in him is alive and
[53:01] well it's all also quickening our mortal
[53:05] bodies to get alive in this word that is
[53:08] what opens our eyes to a resurrection
[53:10] power in this age is the same spirit
[53:13] that Christ went down with is the same
[53:16] spirit that he resurrected with will
[53:18] open our eyes in this word
[53:21] and Jesus answering said unto them
[53:23] suffer it to be so now for it becoming
[53:25] somebody say us
[53:27] to fulfill all righteousness
[53:31] then he suffered him then it becometh us
[53:35] to fulfill our righteousness so now we
[53:38] have a responsibility to play we've got
[53:40] a part to play in this it becometh us
[53:43] so no longer is it just a Christ of
[53:45] yesterday but it's the Christ of today
[53:47] and where is he he's not in a tomb he's
[53:50] not he's not somewhere back away but he
[53:52] said I will be with you even in you
[53:56] right
[53:57] now Brother Band will break this down
[53:58] really simply uh in uh in putting on the
[54:01] whole armor of God he would say it's God
[54:03] over us God With Us God in us and then
[54:06] he says ye are gods
[54:08] so that's a real powerful Revelation in
[54:11] just a few words God over us God With Us
[54:13] God in us ye are Gods the same
[54:15] resurrection power that was in him is
[54:19] also in you so why would we seek a
[54:21] living power amongst the dead tradition
[54:24] why would we want to blend in with
[54:25] another church or blend in with a
[54:27] denomination or blend in with the rest
[54:29] of the world when we're not of the world
[54:31] we're of another world another kingdom
[54:34] that we are called to be a resurrected
[54:37] power right now not waiting those of us
[54:40] that still have breath in our lungs are
[54:41] not waiting for it we are it we're the
[54:44] resurrection of the word in this hour
[54:46] it's not coming it's here right
[54:50] we've gone to do a service for the king
[54:52] but we've got to know where he's at and
[54:54] so when they come they come back from
[54:57] from this from this Revelation that
[54:59] they've had they come back to share it
[55:01] with the other believers that so they
[55:03] think that they're thinking you're gonna
[55:05] love this you're gonna love what I have
[55:06] to bring to you he's not in a tomb but
[55:09] it's open
[55:10] right and they say they're telling idle
[55:12] Tales
[55:14] well no that can't be we watched the
[55:16] tomb roll and you know that was only for
[55:18] the
[55:20] or that was only for Christ to fulfill I
[55:23] can't it can't be that he's alive
[55:25] somebody must have taken his body
[55:27] somebody must have stole his body and
[55:30] you know it just can't be now these are
[55:31] so-called Believers right these women
[55:33] are coming back and they're telling what
[55:35] they have seen with their own eyes and
[55:37] they're meeting results of you're just
[55:39] telling an idle tale you're just telling
[55:41] a a tall tale you're telling something
[55:44] false you know you're painting a big
[55:46] story you're trying to get our hope up
[55:47] and I believe that's what the devil has
[55:49] attacked a church with in this hour that
[55:51] a Ministry would come and it would try
[55:53] to encourage our faith and say you know
[55:54] the word is not back in yesterday but
[55:57] the word is alive today and brother
[55:59] Branham encountered those same spirits
[56:01] to say the days of Miracles are past and
[56:03] you say no they're not they're alive and
[56:05] well today but us in the church today
[56:08] are encountering the same exact
[56:10] opposition when we come and say the
[56:11] words open it's out amongst us we're in
[56:14] a resurrection we're in a Revival this
[56:16] is the bride's Revival and they would
[56:18] look at you and say well you're just
[56:19] telling an idle Tale But I know what
[56:22] I've seen and I know what I've
[56:24] experienced and there's no way you can
[56:25] take that away from me the tomb is open
[56:28] unto me it might not be open up to
[56:30] everybody but it's open unto me and as
[56:33] for me I've seen a resurrected Christ
[56:35] that's not letting down waiting for
[56:37] something but he's on the Move in this
[56:40] age
[56:41] you know and we'll go into a service and
[56:43] no doubt brother Samuel will be in a
[56:45] powerful anointing this weekend and the
[56:47] Lord will use him in a mighty way but
[56:48] there's always a spirit of criticism
[56:50] that comes when you tell people to take
[56:52] God at his word and that Spirit of
[56:55] criticism will come and maybe many of
[56:56] you don't feel it but the minister feels
[56:58] it that you're just trying to falsely
[57:00] lead the people on and you're getting
[57:02] their hopes up
[57:03] well if I was getting your hopes up into
[57:05] me I would have something wrong with me
[57:08] if I was saying by my power and what I
[57:10] can do for you and you can walk here
[57:12] free I would be getting your hopes up
[57:14] into a cunning Fable and I don't tell
[57:17] but that's not what we're doing under
[57:20] this message under this anointing it's
[57:22] not about us it's not about a prophet
[57:24] it's not about a book or it's not about
[57:26] under understanding with your own
[57:28] intellect it's about God it's about the
[57:31] power of the Holy Ghost it's about the
[57:33] quickening power that it speaks about in
[57:35] Romans 8 is still on the church today
[57:37] that's where our hopes are built not in
[57:40] a man or a Pulpit or a microphone our
[57:43] hopes are built on the power of the Holy
[57:46] Ghost working in the church doing the
[57:48] same things that he promised he would do
[57:50] and if he did it for one he'll do it for
[57:52] you if he did it back then he'll do it
[57:54] today if he ever did it once he will do
[57:57] it again he's God and he changes not he
[58:00] didn't make a mistake when he did it the
[58:02] first time he did it right the first
[58:05] time and he'll do it right again we've
[58:06] just got to recognize where he's at
[58:08] today
[58:09] we don't got to go back in time to reach
[58:12] him he's right here right now doing the
[58:14] same things looking for people to
[58:16] recognize where he's at
[58:20] well Peter and John had to see it for
[58:22] themselves
[58:23] let's go see and so they ran to the
[58:26] Sepulcher they ran to the tomb and when
[58:28] they got there they said you're right
[58:29] it's open
[58:31] right now let's go find him and then
[58:33] stay there and and stay in their
[58:35] sackcloth and Ashes they they went to go
[58:37] find where the Living God was today in
[58:41] this moment in time so we're not sad
[58:43] we're not downtrodden we know that Our
[58:45] Redeemer has Resurrected
[58:48] Amen brother man was saved now notice we
[58:50] serve a living God with living signs
[58:52] living ordinances
[58:54] Hebrews 9 tells us the same we don't
[58:56] serve dead articles we serve the Living
[58:59] God with the living signs now I go to
[59:02] church or I joined I know the Creed I
[59:04] know the catechism that's dead form so
[59:06] we've got the same thing in our church I
[59:08] I know the church age book front and
[59:10] back and I know I like Fords and I like
[59:13] it's dead catechisms if you don't know
[59:15] the Living God but the true token of the
[59:18] blood speaking out speaks of a living
[59:20] resurrected presence Jesus Christ the
[59:23] same yesterday today and forever living
[59:26] right now Among Us somebody say us
[59:29] it speaks better from not from dead
[59:32] forms or Creeds but a living token of a
[59:34] living resurrected Christ that lives in
[59:37] somebody say us us no they deny there is
[59:41] such a thing but we know it's true but
[59:43] we who believe the word know that God
[59:46] promised it and he keeps his promise no
[59:49] it is his living promise for he does as
[59:52] he did
[59:53] so it's not a fable or an idle tell for
[59:56] me to tell you that you could walk out
[59:57] of here a free person you don't have to
[1:00:00] walk out with the same cloud of doubt
[1:00:01] that you walked in with you don't have
[1:00:03] to walk out with the same cancer that
[1:00:05] you walked in with you don't have to
[1:00:06] walk out with the same oppression that
[1:00:08] you walked in with but God does as he
[1:00:11] did and if he ever sent somebody free he
[1:00:14] will make somebody free today he's God
[1:00:16] and he keeps his word and he changes it
[1:00:20] not free for you and for a color for
[1:00:22] this or that but he keeps his word with
[1:00:24] whoever's faithful
[1:00:26] so we're faithful to his word
[1:00:28] recognizing it's the same somebody say
[1:00:30] same I want us to get that point and
[1:00:33] drive it home it's the same spirit that
[1:00:36] he had we also have not different or
[1:00:39] lesser you know I think in this age we
[1:00:41] find that men are trying to lower the
[1:00:44] Holy Ghost standards somehow where it's
[1:00:45] a lesser anointing than God they're
[1:00:48] going back to a trinitarian Doctrine
[1:00:50] we've got to recognize it's the same
[1:00:53] it's God over us God With Us God in us
[1:00:57] it's all God right so the power of the
[1:00:59] Holy Ghost is not somehow less than some
[1:01:01] deep Revelation I don't believe you can
[1:01:03] get a deeper Revelation than the power
[1:01:05] of the Holy Ghost in the church it's God
[1:01:07] in morphe it's God Amen it's God
[1:01:11] dwelling inside a tabernacle that is
[1:01:14] made not by hands but a tabernacle of
[1:01:17] flesh is where God lays in the stage
[1:01:19] that is the power of the Holy Ghost I
[1:01:22] will not stand by and let somebody
[1:01:24] belittle it down to emotion or shouting
[1:01:26] or jumping even though it makes me do
[1:01:28] those things but that is not what the
[1:01:30] Holy Ghost is in this age it is adoption
[1:01:33] Authority that by it we can call the
[1:01:35] Resurrection on without the power of the
[1:01:37] Holy Ghost she will never understand
[1:01:39] what the resurrection is without the
[1:01:41] holy ghost in your life you'll never
[1:01:42] have access to the promises that God
[1:01:44] gave it'll be an intellectual
[1:01:46] understanding of the words that are in
[1:01:48] the book but it's better to know the
[1:01:50] author of the book which is the holy
[1:01:53] ghost himself it's Jesus it's the token
[1:01:56] it's whatever you want to call if you
[1:01:57] want to call it the Holy Spirit that's
[1:01:59] fine with me I don't care what you call
[1:02:01] it just get it
[1:02:03] just understand that it's not somehow
[1:02:04] less
[1:02:06] than God or Jesus well I want the
[1:02:08] character of Christ well the character
[1:02:10] of Christ is the Holy Ghost it's not two
[1:02:13] different things it's very the the same
[1:02:15] very thing it's him
[1:02:17] it's all him
[1:02:19] it's Christ the man said it was Christ
[1:02:21] that opened the Red Sea it was Christ
[1:02:23] that crossed over into the promised land
[1:02:25] it was Christ that stopped the sun it
[1:02:28] was Christ that called down stones from
[1:02:30] Heaven it was Christ that gave those
[1:02:31] things you see the anointing of the hour
[1:02:33] is Christ that's why there's an attack
[1:02:36] on the anointing of the hour to say that
[1:02:38] it's not the same as it was and we've
[1:02:41] got to move on past this well I'm not
[1:02:43] listening to a fable tale cunningly
[1:02:45] devised by a man I'm looking at the word
[1:02:48] for what it says I am and it says I can
[1:02:51] too it says the same power that he had
[1:02:54] the same spirit that he had I will have
[1:02:56] also and the same Authority that he had
[1:02:59] we are joint heirs with Christ joint
[1:03:02] heirs in the Kingdom right the same
[1:03:04] Authority that he had we also have
[1:03:08] my I believe we ought to have the devil
[1:03:10] on the run to know that we have the same
[1:03:13] power that put him out of commission the
[1:03:15] same power that took the keys off his
[1:03:18] waist the same anointing that came down
[1:03:20] and took over his own home is the same
[1:03:23] anointing that we live in and we dwell
[1:03:25] in it's the message of the hour and we
[1:03:27] will not find it under our own ideas or
[1:03:30] theology our own understanding we've got
[1:03:32] to lean only to the word
[1:03:34] lean not to that own understanding but
[1:03:37] only lean on the word
[1:03:39] it's the only true thing
[1:03:41] for the band would say now the thing of
[1:03:43] it is those things uh speeches instead
[1:03:46] of the word the word being manifest is
[1:03:48] the evidence that it's right
[1:03:50] see the word being manifested they will
[1:03:53] never look at that you've got to have an
[1:03:55] intellectual conception to know and go
[1:03:57] to the Seminary and learn how to Bow and
[1:03:59] how to stand in one place and all oh
[1:04:01] that would choke a minister to death
[1:04:03] that was really filled with the Holy
[1:04:04] Spirit now that's an intellectual but he
[1:04:07] says the word being manifested is the
[1:04:10] evidence that it's right
[1:04:13] so where is the life taking place
[1:04:17] now we never want to make this about
[1:04:19] sides or this church or that church or
[1:04:21] we never identify a name or a person or
[1:04:24] we're talking about spirits
[1:04:27] we're talking about spirits in the end
[1:04:28] time that are trying to take the power
[1:04:30] away from you not that they they don't
[1:04:33] have access to and they can't use it but
[1:04:35] as long as you're not using it we're
[1:04:37] stalled those loved ones that have gone
[1:04:40] on before that are waiting for their
[1:04:41] name to be called were stalled that that
[1:04:44] that Rapture the changing of our bodies
[1:04:46] were stalled as long as that power is
[1:04:49] not being exercised in the church but I
[1:04:52] believe we're at the time when that
[1:04:54] power is restored to the church where
[1:04:56] we're saying enough with with church
[1:04:57] entity enough with religion enough with
[1:05:00] Creeds and Theology and man's thoughts
[1:05:02] but let's go onward into the promises
[1:05:05] that God gave the church that's where we
[1:05:07] live it being manifested is the
[1:05:10] Vindication of it so where is the life
[1:05:13] taking place
[1:05:14] that's what I look for where's the life
[1:05:16] taking place now we we probably
[1:05:19] encounter people in this walk and you've
[1:05:20] been in the church long enough that
[1:05:22] maybe even somebody in this room you
[1:05:23] just not everybody rubs shoulders Wells
[1:05:25] together
[1:05:26] you know I'm sure if we sat down long
[1:05:28] enough you'd find something or maybe
[1:05:30] you've already have that you just that's
[1:05:32] something about him I just don't like or
[1:05:33] you know there's just I just can't rub
[1:05:35] shoulders with that or you know I just
[1:05:37] don't get along with everybody what
[1:05:38] we're not called to be best friends with
[1:05:39] everybody
[1:05:41] but we're called to have perfect love
[1:05:43] for one another and never mistake that
[1:05:46] it's a spirit behind that offense it's
[1:05:48] not the person it's not the sister it's
[1:05:51] not the brother it's the spirit behind
[1:05:53] that offense that is causing you to be
[1:05:55] distracted from your Victory I hope
[1:05:57] that's okay tonight but I don't want to
[1:05:59] put a name or a face to it I'm sure we
[1:06:01] associate it with it in our mind but
[1:06:03] recognize it's a spirit trying to
[1:06:05] distract us from the victory at hand
[1:06:08] many times there'll be distractions in
[1:06:10] our life and we don't even realize what
[1:06:12] they are but it's the devil trying to
[1:06:14] keep our Focus off of the word many
[1:06:17] times in in a church service I think
[1:06:19] about uh it's happened to me over in in
[1:06:21] Africa and I know brother Wayne's told
[1:06:23] similar stories probably brother Samuel
[1:06:24] has similar stories he'll be dealing
[1:06:26] with somebody and and a spirit will
[1:06:28] break loose over here and it'll draw all
[1:06:30] the attention to it and you'll spend all
[1:06:32] night trying to cast out this Spirit out
[1:06:33] of this person and you gave up the
[1:06:35] blessing over there it's a distraction
[1:06:37] to take you off of why you're here I
[1:06:40] believe that applies to us as everyone
[1:06:41] individual in here something will break
[1:06:43] loose a temperament will break loose so
[1:06:46] we'll have an attitude against this
[1:06:47] person or that person or we won't go
[1:06:49] back to church because of this or we
[1:06:50] don't like this song leader or we don't
[1:06:52] like this drum player or we don't like
[1:06:53] this so we don't like that it's a
[1:06:55] distraction off of our focus of why
[1:06:58] we're here don't forget why you're here
[1:07:01] you're here to fulfill the word and be
[1:07:04] the manifestation of it thereby being
[1:07:06] the Vindication of the message of the
[1:07:09] hour it's on you don't get distracted
[1:07:11] about why you've been positionally
[1:07:13] placed here where you're at don't get
[1:07:16] distracted by Little Things
[1:07:17] don't get distracted by well I wish it
[1:07:19] was this way or I'd fix this or I'd
[1:07:21] tweak this or if I had my way that's a
[1:07:23] distraction don't let a spirit take your
[1:07:26] focus off of why you've been placed here
[1:07:29] off of why you're in this age to begin
[1:07:32] with why are you in this age to begin
[1:07:34] with is it to fit in with the world or
[1:07:36] just be uh you know have a a woe is me
[1:07:38] life or just you know it's so hard and
[1:07:41] yeah all those things are true but
[1:07:43] that's not why you're here
[1:07:45] this is the hardest age that there's
[1:07:46] ever been
[1:07:47] but that's not why you're here
[1:07:49] this is the hardest age to enter into a
[1:07:52] real belief in a living God but that's
[1:07:54] not why you're here you're here to be
[1:07:56] the Vindication of this word to put your
[1:07:59] focus back on the word say Lord maybe
[1:08:01] I've got my eye to the left to the right
[1:08:03] but tonight put my focus back on the
[1:08:05] word maybe I've been looking at this
[1:08:07] false or that falter why this isn't okay
[1:08:09] but put my focus back on the word
[1:08:11] anybody can see the false anybody can
[1:08:14] see the failures where the Paul you can
[1:08:15] look at me and say well this brother's
[1:08:16] failing here here here here here he's an
[1:08:19] eagle he's got Eagle Vision he can see
[1:08:21] he's got discernment the bride's got the
[1:08:23] sermon in this hour they can see the
[1:08:25] issue everybody can see the issue but
[1:08:28] the character of Christ is what you do
[1:08:30] when you see the issue that's what tells
[1:08:33] you if you've got the life the
[1:08:34] Vindication of the message I see the
[1:08:36] issue but let's love the brother and
[1:08:38] bring it under the blood and let's get
[1:08:41] the issue fixed now I'm gonna tear them
[1:08:43] apart I'm gonna shred everything that
[1:08:44] he'll never have a you see the spirit
[1:08:46] that's behind that that's not love
[1:08:49] love covereth all right love Envy is not
[1:08:54] love covers a multitude of sin
[1:08:58] now we say well brother you're trying to
[1:08:59] cover up sin I'm trying to let the love
[1:09:01] of God cover sin because it covered you
[1:09:03] it covered me it's covered our mistakes
[1:09:06] time after time every time we've we've
[1:09:09] fallen or we've we've felt it's the love
[1:09:12] of God that brings us back it's it's the
[1:09:14] blood which is the love of God that he
[1:09:16] spilled it was love that brought him to
[1:09:18] the Cross to begin with right it was
[1:09:20] love that drunk him to Calvary it was
[1:09:21] love that allowed him to hang there it
[1:09:23] was love that let him push on and say
[1:09:25] not my will but thine be done it was
[1:09:28] love so it's love that will cover us
[1:09:31] when we're mistaken so we would be we
[1:09:34] would not have God's spirit if we were
[1:09:36] not willing to cover
[1:09:39] I hope you understand I'm not preaching
[1:09:41] disgrace
[1:09:42] but it's easy to spot
[1:09:44] it's easy to be Balaam and look at the
[1:09:47] back side of Israel and see every flaw
[1:09:50] and every mistake and I just I can't
[1:09:52] wait for my chance to pounce on this and
[1:09:54] you know oh man and that's easy
[1:09:57] anybody could do that
[1:10:00] but what can you do with that power
[1:10:03] that's what makes you a true Eagle the
[1:10:06] vision to see is here in this age you
[1:10:08] can't hide anything the words open true
[1:10:11] you can't you think that I could get by
[1:10:13] by an unconsecrated life you're the
[1:10:15] bride I'm speaking to the wife of Jesus
[1:10:17] Christ who's got the same spirit that he
[1:10:20] had
[1:10:21] and it's through then
[1:10:22] see through
[1:10:25] but what do we do with that power
[1:10:28] we've got to use it the same way that he
[1:10:31] used it he looked upon the Rich Young
[1:10:34] Ruler and loved him he had compassion on
[1:10:36] him but he knew the choice he would make
[1:10:39] but he still had compassion on him he
[1:10:42] still looked at him and and and and
[1:10:44] wanted him to make the right decision
[1:10:45] with all that was within him make the
[1:10:47] right decision but he knew he wouldn't
[1:10:49] make the right decision but we might not
[1:10:52] have the foresight to know who will and
[1:10:53] who won't so we better treat everybody
[1:10:55] like they will
[1:10:57] is that all right
[1:10:58] so we are the Vindication that this word
[1:11:00] is true not an idle tale brother random
[1:11:03] said it was cowards that made it an idol
[1:11:05] tale now he's speaking in his church to
[1:11:07] his ministry he's saying it's cowards
[1:11:09] that have turned this into an idle tale
[1:11:11] they've made it they've made it as Peter
[1:11:13] would say for we have not followed
[1:11:15] commonly devised fables but we we made
[1:11:18] known unto you the power of the coming
[1:11:19] of our Lord Jesus Christ but were
[1:11:22] eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:11:25] Peter we're going to say the more
[1:11:26] excellent Glory he's speaking of Mount
[1:11:28] Transfiguration right eyewitnesses
[1:11:31] of his glory now maybe we weren't there
[1:11:33] at Mount Transfiguration literally but
[1:11:36] were eyewitnesses of his glory today to
[1:11:39] know what he's doing in the church to
[1:11:41] know where he's headed
[1:11:43] and we're headed in the same direction
[1:11:44] right
[1:11:46] but it's not a it's not a fable we're
[1:11:48] not cowards uh we're not we're not
[1:11:50] backing up he's not in the Tomb
[1:11:53] he's risen
[1:11:57] I believe it's in Revelations 21. can
[1:12:00] you pull up Revelations 21
[1:12:02] I don't know about maybe
[1:12:05] maybe verse 14 or so
[1:12:07] it's just coming to me so I just trust
[1:12:09] trust is the Lord but we we cannot stand
[1:12:12] by and we can it's easy for us to put on
[1:12:15] uh go down a little further
[1:12:18] look can I read it here
[1:12:26] go down a little bit
[1:12:28] yeah
[1:12:30] down
[1:12:32] yeah
[1:12:33] sorry maybe I'll just look it up it's
[1:12:35] it's in Revelations 21.
[1:12:37] but
[1:12:39] we can say that it's a preacher
[1:12:42] that has turned this word because he's a
[1:12:45] coward and wouldn't move into it but
[1:12:46] what would make him do that he's afraid
[1:12:49] to lose his reputation brother Bram said
[1:12:50] by putting it on the word
[1:12:53] now brother Ben would challenge that
[1:12:55] over and over people would say well you
[1:12:56] know you're just a you're mind reading
[1:12:58] you're this or that he said I challenge
[1:13:00] you to come to the platform and dispute
[1:13:02] anything that's taken place and nobody
[1:13:03] would do it he was willing to put his
[1:13:05] name with the word right and that was
[1:13:07] the Vindication of God with him and so
[1:13:10] we can look at the ministry that was
[1:13:11] around and they weren't willing to put
[1:13:13] their name with the word to be a
[1:13:14] Vindication of it because brother mam
[1:13:16] says they were cowards and wouldn't go
[1:13:18] into it here it is
[1:13:20] this verse uh we'll start at six and he
[1:13:22] said unto me it is done I am Alpha and
[1:13:24] Omega the beginning and the end I will
[1:13:26] give unto him that is the thirst of the
[1:13:28] Fountain of the Water of Life freely he
[1:13:30] that overcometh shall inherit somebody
[1:13:31] say all things
[1:13:34] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:13:36] son but the fearful
[1:13:41] somebody say fearful
[1:13:44] but the fearful
[1:13:46] and unbelieving and abominable and
[1:13:48] murderers and whoremongers and Sorcerers
[1:13:50] and idolaters and Liars shall have their
[1:13:54] part in the lake which burneth with fire
[1:13:56] in Brimstone which is the second death
[1:14:01] the fearful
[1:14:02] with murderers
[1:14:04] and Liars
[1:14:06] and sorcerers
[1:14:08] and whoremongers
[1:14:10] now those of you that have a naturally
[1:14:12] nervous Spirit I'm not talking about
[1:14:13] that kind of fear
[1:14:16] the fearful
[1:14:17] cowards
[1:14:19] that won't take God at his word
[1:14:22] that are afraid to put their name on the
[1:14:24] line with God and His word the fearful
[1:14:27] that's the destination of those who are
[1:14:30] afraid to rise to the challenge with God
[1:14:32] and His word we don't want to be in that
[1:14:34] group we don't want to just say it's an
[1:14:36] idle tale or it's for another time or
[1:14:38] that's just for an emotional bunch of
[1:14:40] people or that's just for this or that
[1:14:42] there's going to be somebody that
[1:14:43] recognizes I see the word and it's my
[1:14:46] duty to fulfill it let me just clear up
[1:14:48] this little fear here that the church
[1:14:49] has that I'm not going to make the
[1:14:51] Rapture if you see it it's for you amen
[1:14:54] all right if you see the son of man it's
[1:14:57] for you if you see the holy ghost power
[1:15:00] in the church it's for you because God's
[1:15:02] not going to reveal something to you and
[1:15:03] then say you can't have it brother Brian
[1:15:05] God's not going to say to you you can
[1:15:06] this is all I've laid out there and say
[1:15:09] but it's not for you you can't have it
[1:15:10] if God showed it to you then it's for
[1:15:12] you to possess if God showed you there's
[1:15:15] a revelation in this hour that will free
[1:15:17] you from every oppression that it's for
[1:15:20] you to possess it you've just gotta walk
[1:15:22] on and say that's mine I see it I
[1:15:24] receive it I see it I believe it I see
[1:15:27] there's a word coming I I believe it I
[1:15:30] see there's a word that's changing
[1:15:31] Hearts I believe it I see that this
[1:15:34] message is true it's for me you don't
[1:15:36] have to wonder is it for me it is for
[1:15:38] you if you see it do you see it brother
[1:15:41] man will say that time I don't know how
[1:15:43] many times do you see at church do you
[1:15:45] see it he's saying if you see it it's
[1:15:48] for you if you see the seals are open
[1:15:50] then it's for you if you see the tomb is
[1:15:53] open then it's for you if you see the
[1:15:56] word is walking about then it's for you
[1:15:58] if you see the manifestation of God's
[1:16:00] power is in the church right now than it
[1:16:03] is for you if you see healing in your
[1:16:06] body then it's for you if you see your
[1:16:08] children coming home then it's for you
[1:16:10] if you see it then it is for you
[1:16:13] don't be discouraged and say well I see
[1:16:16] that God can do it but I don't know if
[1:16:18] you see it then it's yours to have God
[1:16:20] is not going to show you a divine
[1:16:22] revelation and then say that you can't
[1:16:24] have it if you see it it's your
[1:16:26] possession take it and go forward
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:30] don't be fearful about it and say well I
[1:16:32] see it but I'll just hang back huh you
[1:16:34] know I'll just wait for another day the
[1:16:36] fearful will have their place in the
[1:16:38] Lake of Fire but the Church of the
[1:16:40] Living God do not dwell in fear but we
[1:16:42] walk on in faith knowing exactly what's
[1:16:45] been given to us in this hour if we see
[1:16:47] it it's ours to possess
[1:16:50] we know why we've been called here
[1:16:52] we see all these things taking place in
[1:16:54] the signs that are all around if we see
[1:16:56] it it's for us to have
[1:16:58] Peter said we saw a more excellent Glory
[1:17:02] if we see it adoption Authority is ours
[1:17:05] if we see it spoken word power is ours
[1:17:08] if we see it the third poll is ours it's
[1:17:11] not just catchphrases that God gives to
[1:17:13] the church that we can have some other
[1:17:15] Doctrine over another church it's a
[1:17:17] revelation that what he's doing in this
[1:17:19] hour you can too
[1:17:21] right it wasn't just for one man
[1:17:24] 1965 is for right now this church can do
[1:17:28] the same works that he did 2 000 years
[1:17:30] ago he will do again in the church if
[1:17:33] you see it it's for you
[1:17:36] it's yours to have it's yours to grasp
[1:17:38] no man can come to me unless my father
[1:17:40] draws him no man told you about it but
[1:17:42] it's God who showed it to you and if God
[1:17:44] if God thought you good enough to show
[1:17:46] it to you then God thinks you're good
[1:17:48] enough to possess it if you see it it's
[1:17:50] for you
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:17:52] if you see a life victorious in the
[1:17:55] power of the Holy Ghost it's for you
[1:17:57] if you see that these Revelations are
[1:18:00] not just a theology that but they're the
[1:18:02] Living manifested Word walking down the
[1:18:04] road to Emmaus breaking bread with them
[1:18:06] then it's for you to see but you've got
[1:18:09] to recognize it right those two walking
[1:18:11] on the road to Emmaus they knew that he
[1:18:12] would be resurrected they followed him
[1:18:14] they were his disciples cleophus and a
[1:18:17] friend right we're walking down the road
[1:18:18] to Emmaus I believe I was that friend
[1:18:20] and we're walking down and we're not
[1:18:22] sure where the Lord is or what he's
[1:18:23] doing and we knew he would be
[1:18:25] resurrected but we've got to know where
[1:18:27] he's at today right now what he's doing
[1:18:29] at this moment in time and so we're
[1:18:31] walking down the road and we're
[1:18:32] discouraged and we're upset and we're
[1:18:34] saying there's trouble in the church and
[1:18:35] everybody's bumping into each other
[1:18:37] nobody can get along and there's
[1:18:38] doctrines over here and this one over
[1:18:40] here and we don't know which way to go
[1:18:41] and we're so discouraged in ourselves
[1:18:43] but then there comes another man walking
[1:18:45] amongst us and he's telling us of the
[1:18:48] power of God testifying of us that it's
[1:18:51] the same spirit
[1:18:52] well did not your Prophet say this and
[1:18:55] this and this and this and this and this
[1:18:57] it starts to go down the line of
[1:18:59] everything that the prophets prophesied
[1:19:00] would come and they said yes all those
[1:19:02] things are true and you see the
[1:19:03] anointing around them change to the
[1:19:05] atmosphere that they were under began to
[1:19:06] change and then the Lord began to speak
[1:19:09] to them directly and they recognized
[1:19:11] it's him so when they saw it they knew
[1:19:14] it was him right when he came in they
[1:19:16] constrained him to stay with them and he
[1:19:18] began to break the bread now the
[1:19:20] breaking of the bread is the opening of
[1:19:22] the word it's how he opens the word to
[1:19:24] us that we recognize the Vindication of
[1:19:26] it right so as a bride we're in that
[1:19:29] little room and he's opening the word to
[1:19:31] us and we're recognizing it's Christ
[1:19:33] he's here if you see him then he's for
[1:19:36] us and if Christ is here he's not here
[1:19:39] to take a back seat somewhere or because
[1:19:41] he's got nowhere else to be but Christ
[1:19:43] is here to do a work and if we recognize
[1:19:46] that Christ is in our little room then
[1:19:49] what will we do with this Jesus called
[1:19:51] the Christ that's living with inside of
[1:19:53] us he will do the Greater Works through
[1:19:56] you
[1:19:57] it's him it's all him it never was you
[1:20:01] or me or brother Branham or Ezekiel or
[1:20:04] Isaiah or anybody else with a name it's
[1:20:06] Christ the anointing of God is the same
[1:20:10] one that's here and are missed in this
[1:20:12] hour
[1:20:13] and he does not walk in fear but he
[1:20:16] knows exactly where he's at and who he
[1:20:18] is brother Adam said he was positive of
[1:20:20] who he was can't we be positive of who
[1:20:23] we are in this hour
[1:20:25] we don't want to be clumped together
[1:20:26] with the fearful we want to know where
[1:20:28] we're at go boldly Before the Throne of
[1:20:30] God knowing who you are
[1:20:33] I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God
[1:20:36] he wants me to come he wants to hear
[1:20:38] from me he wants to take on my needs he
[1:20:41] wants to take on my burden you see it's
[1:20:43] different when you know somebody wants
[1:20:44] it from you
[1:20:46] you know when you call your daddy you
[1:20:47] need to borrow money again you say dad
[1:20:49] you know I need to borrow you know I
[1:20:51] need 20 bucks dad
[1:20:53] and you think I don't know if he's going
[1:20:55] to want to give it today
[1:20:57] well maybe I will maybe I won't what do
[1:20:59] you need it for
[1:21:03] well it's different when you call
[1:21:04] somebody you break down you say hey I
[1:21:05] need a ride
[1:21:06] can you come pick me up they may they
[1:21:08] may not
[1:21:10] they may have time they may be busy
[1:21:12] it was a shame sometimes you need just a
[1:21:14] uh you know a favor and you call
[1:21:15] somebody hey can you help me move about
[1:21:17] a new house you got a truck
[1:21:19] can you come help me
[1:21:21] they may they may not
[1:21:24] but it's a lot different going to ask
[1:21:25] somebody for something when you know
[1:21:27] it's their greatest desire to give it to
[1:21:29] you
[1:21:30] a faithful Mama it's her greatest desire
[1:21:33] to make her children lunch
[1:21:34] when her kids come to say mom I want a
[1:21:36] peanut butter sandwich you may not but
[1:21:38] she may not feel like it she may be
[1:21:39] tired but she's gonna get up and she's
[1:21:41] gonna make him a peanut butter sandwich
[1:21:42] because that's the desire of her heart
[1:21:44] is to feed her children right where our
[1:21:46] heavenly father is where that attribute
[1:21:48] comes from that we have not because we
[1:21:50] ask not because we're fearful about what
[1:21:53] he will say but our God is not a god of
[1:21:55] hate Satan is hate our God is love right
[1:21:59] so we need to recognize who we're
[1:22:01] approaching we're not approaching Satan
[1:22:02] that he might cast us down and say well
[1:22:05] you didn't you didn't do your 31-day
[1:22:06] men's last week so I'm not going to give
[1:22:08] it to you and we're gonna walk away with
[1:22:10] this reproach upon our life and say well
[1:22:11] I need to do better before I go back and
[1:22:13] ask the Lord Brother Ben he does not
[1:22:15] care what you did yesterday he cares
[1:22:16] what you're doing right now he does not
[1:22:18] care how you forsook him last week he
[1:22:21] cares what you're doing right now the
[1:22:23] devil is the only one who brings
[1:22:25] remembrance Upon Our Lives about how we
[1:22:27] failed the Lord the Lord didn't bring
[1:22:29] that upon our heart to say this is where
[1:22:31] you failed and this is where you misstep
[1:22:33] but the devil brought that upon us that
[1:22:35] we would be afraid to approach the
[1:22:37] throne with boldness to ask of the Lord
[1:22:39] that we might receive
[1:22:41] God is love
[1:22:44] so therefore he loves his children to
[1:22:47] come and ask of him I love him my boys
[1:22:49] come and ask hey Dad will you show me
[1:22:51] how to do this or teach me how to do
[1:22:52] that because I'm giving them something
[1:22:54] I'm giving them a knowledge
[1:22:57] right that I learned the hard way
[1:23:00] that I had to go through life and I said
[1:23:02] one day I'm going to teach my boy this
[1:23:04] skill one day I'm going to show him how
[1:23:06] to do this and when he comes and asks
[1:23:08] I'll be I'll be glad for it right but
[1:23:10] then we look at God the father and we
[1:23:11] think well he's
[1:23:13] you know he's a miser
[1:23:15] he's got the wealth but he doesn't want
[1:23:17] to spend it
[1:23:21] well he's got the Holy Ghost locked up
[1:23:23] in there
[1:23:24] and I've been asking for it for years
[1:23:27] and now I'm just afraid to ask for it
[1:23:30] God is not the way we think he is
[1:23:33] he's not sitting on a bench somewhere
[1:23:35] saying yeah they're gonna come to me
[1:23:38] God is the attribute of love what's the
[1:23:42] Capstone of this age love
[1:23:44] it's not it's not anything else but love
[1:23:47] right and what's the second one now I
[1:23:49] just thought this was interesting the
[1:23:50] statue of a perfect man this is totally
[1:23:51] inspiration preaching so I hope it's for
[1:23:53] you but Faith Rex builds it and it makes
[1:23:56] sense and patience and knowledge and
[1:23:57] virtue and Temperance and kindness and
[1:23:59] godliness brotherly kindness what is
[1:24:02] that doing at the top
[1:24:04] all right
[1:24:06] and then on top of Brotherly kindness is
[1:24:08] the Holy Ghost makes sense and then what
[1:24:11] brings down the Capstone love
[1:24:14] in our mind we would have had that
[1:24:15] opposite would have had that totally
[1:24:17] backwards well first let's shake hands
[1:24:19] with one another then we come into the
[1:24:20] church and then we get Godly and then
[1:24:22] we'll get kind
[1:24:23] and you see the process of man's mind is
[1:24:25] the exact opposite of God's way but he
[1:24:28] said add on to this this and add unto
[1:24:30] this this and first start here before
[1:24:32] you can go here first have faith that he
[1:24:34] is God and he is rewarder of those that
[1:24:36] diligently seek him and then build on
[1:24:38] top of that and then that and that and
[1:24:40] that the hardest thing is brotherly
[1:24:42] kindness why because we know one another
[1:24:47] we have to live with one another
[1:24:49] and the hardest thing for us to do is to
[1:24:52] look past the faults of one another and
[1:24:54] recognize the attribute of God that's
[1:24:56] within there and say I maybe I don't
[1:24:58] agree with everything but there's a God
[1:25:00] in there that I agree with maybe I don't
[1:25:02] agree with this or that but there's an
[1:25:04] element of God in there that I cling to
[1:25:06] there's just a love there there's a
[1:25:08] there's a fellowship there and and
[1:25:10] though I maybe I'll never be maybe I'll
[1:25:12] never go on a barbecue with this fellow
[1:25:13] but I love him because there's a peace
[1:25:15] of God in there
[1:25:17] God didn't require that we all be best
[1:25:19] friends God required that we love one
[1:25:22] another and by this the world will know
[1:25:25] that ye are my disciples I wonder if now
[1:25:28] if the world were to take a microscope
[1:25:30] on us as an individual would they know
[1:25:32] that we're a disciple of Jesus Christ
[1:25:35] how would they know
[1:25:37] buy this
[1:25:39] that she loved one another
[1:25:43] Capstone Authority it's not foolish it's
[1:25:46] not simple preaching it's the Capstone
[1:25:48] message to the age add unto this this
[1:25:51] and this this and this this and what's
[1:25:54] the what's the authority coming down
[1:25:55] love
[1:25:57] but bam will say we've got to be honed
[1:26:00] we've got to be scratched down we've got
[1:26:03] to be shaved to receive that Capstone to
[1:26:06] come down and that Capstone is love so
[1:26:08] it's really hard for us to let go of our
[1:26:11] own ideas and our own thoughts and just
[1:26:13] love love God above all else and when
[1:26:16] you love God you love all of his
[1:26:18] attributes when you love the word you
[1:26:20] love everything that's in it you love it
[1:26:22] I say well you don't even go to our
[1:26:23] church but there's somebody in here that
[1:26:25] you may not like and they do go to your
[1:26:27] church and you've got to love them
[1:26:28] there's somebody out there in another
[1:26:30] church or this person or that family
[1:26:31] member or this or that we're not going
[1:26:33] to make it by by how many ties that
[1:26:36] we've cut when we make it there and say
[1:26:37] well this is my victory of of cut ties
[1:26:40] that I've cut off relationships with and
[1:26:42] I've I've said that their day of Grace
[1:26:44] has passed and there's no hope for them
[1:26:45] we're not going to make it there by that
[1:26:47] Paul but we're going to make it by the
[1:26:48] attribute of love that God gave to the
[1:26:51] church because that's the only way that
[1:26:54] we'll know where we're standing right if
[1:26:56] we try to approach the throne and we're
[1:26:58] fearful about it then we'll never see
[1:27:00] what we have need of if we try to
[1:27:02] approach the father and we're scared
[1:27:04] about it then we don't love him enough
[1:27:05] to go to him but when we love him enough
[1:27:07] and we recognize him as the kind
[1:27:09] heavenly father who loves us above all
[1:27:12] things and he is loved and we will go to
[1:27:14] him boldly and say Lord I have need of
[1:27:16] this and we recognize that he loves us
[1:27:19] more than anything in the world and he
[1:27:21] would love for us to walk in perfect
[1:27:23] Victory and he would love for us to walk
[1:27:25] in perfect health he would love for us
[1:27:27] to never have another headache or a
[1:27:28] migraine or be afraid or be sore or have
[1:27:31] joint problems he would love for every
[1:27:32] arthritic condition to be healed he
[1:27:34] would love for every every mind to be
[1:27:36] sound he would love for that
[1:27:38] we've got to recognize what God's
[1:27:40] attributes are God is not a God saying
[1:27:43] well I just you're going to go through
[1:27:44] this Affliction because you know I just
[1:27:47] think that you're you're a little too
[1:27:49] proud so I'm gonna put this Affliction
[1:27:50] on you
[1:27:51] no we make choices
[1:27:53] and by those choices
[1:27:56] that's a little doctrinal brother Samuel
[1:27:57] can clear it up when he gets home but
[1:27:59] and by those choices we endure life
[1:28:03] and we turned this way and we did that
[1:28:05] God never brought us through that
[1:28:08] don't put something on God that's not
[1:28:09] his fault but what he did promise was in
[1:28:12] the middle of our burdens and our
[1:28:13] troubles and our sorrows he would still
[1:28:15] love us and he would still be there and
[1:28:18] at any time that we would have the faith
[1:28:20] to reach out to him he would remove that
[1:28:22] from us even though it was our fault
[1:28:23] that we were under it God never put us
[1:28:26] into a spirit of unbelief and doubt we
[1:28:28] put ourselves there but even through
[1:28:30] that unbelief and that Spirit of Doubt
[1:28:32] God loves us anyway
[1:28:34] if we could possess that same attribute
[1:28:37] of love we would defeat every demon that
[1:28:40] we Face we would defeat every enemy that
[1:28:42] we encounter every Spirit of sickness
[1:28:44] every Spirit of Doctrine every every win
[1:28:47] that would be set us if we possess the
[1:28:49] Divine attribute of love we would
[1:28:51] project Sovereign Grace that's the word
[1:28:54] and that's where I stand I know it's
[1:28:56] maybe simple or I know you think well
[1:28:58] that's just love brother well the
[1:28:59] Baptists believe love but they don't
[1:29:01] know love like we know love they don't
[1:29:03] have a revelated word like we have they
[1:29:06] don't know the love of God like we know
[1:29:07] we know God's love he came down to us he
[1:29:11] opened himself up to us and he said I
[1:29:13] did this you can also do this because of
[1:29:16] the same spirit that I have I will leave
[1:29:18] with the church take it or leave it
[1:29:22] now we would be fools
[1:29:25] to be a thirst and there'd be a cup of
[1:29:27] water here
[1:29:30] well there's water in the fridge brother
[1:29:31] help yourself no I'm not going to do it
[1:29:34] well that's about how the church is he
[1:29:37] left his spirit in the church to do the
[1:29:39] Greater Works but for some reason we're
[1:29:42] fearful about where did the goat and
[1:29:44] take and drink of the water that he left
[1:29:45] in the church but there's a fountain
[1:29:47] open in the House of David for those who
[1:29:50] would believe I believe I'm speaking to
[1:29:53] people who are believers and say pour it
[1:29:55] out upon me let the fountain pour out
[1:29:58] upon me let every blessing pour out upon
[1:30:00] me let every Victory hit my life let
[1:30:02] every Authority that God has in this age
[1:30:04] come into my lips because I am a
[1:30:07] believer the message is not to the
[1:30:09] unbeliever it's to the Believers so the
[1:30:12] spirit of God in this age will falsely
[1:30:14] anoint and falsely anoint but it's not
[1:30:16] for them it's to you the believer of the
[1:30:19] hour to say that's my authority that's
[1:30:22] my spirit that's my victory I take I'm
[1:30:25] not ashamed of it I'm not going to put
[1:30:27] it to the back or push it to the side I
[1:30:29] want it all I want everything that God's
[1:30:32] given me maybe you've been walking to
[1:30:34] Victory for years but there's more to
[1:30:36] have maybe you've been walking in
[1:30:37] complete and total healing for years but
[1:30:39] there's more to have maybe you've
[1:30:41] experienced the Holy Ghost 30 years ago
[1:30:43] there's more to have there's always more
[1:30:46] to have it's your eyes are open to it
[1:30:48] there's no exhausting the Fountain of
[1:30:51] God's riches in this age that he's given
[1:30:53] to the church and we have not because we
[1:30:57] ask not
[1:30:58] I believe we're coming to a time and
[1:31:00] place where we're ready to take on the
[1:31:03] whole armor of God and everything that
[1:31:05] comes with it I want it
[1:31:08] I want it all
[1:31:10] I don't want to leave anything left you
[1:31:12] know when you're eating good food you
[1:31:13] just clean the plate I believe that's
[1:31:15] how we should do don't leave anything
[1:31:16] left behind but clean the plate I want
[1:31:19] every Victory that's been promised to
[1:31:21] the church I want to see every prodigal
[1:31:24] that the devil's taken out be restored I
[1:31:27] want to see every young person that
[1:31:28] doesn't know the power of his
[1:31:30] resurrection to be filled with the Holy
[1:31:32] Ghost I want to see every borderline
[1:31:34] believer come to a revelation to realize
[1:31:37] I'm not going to make it by my own
[1:31:39] intellect and come under the authority
[1:31:41] of the message of the hour that's what I
[1:31:43] want to see in this age I see it so it's
[1:31:46] for me to have it what do you see in
[1:31:48] your family what do you see in your life
[1:31:50] I see a church walking in Victory that
[1:31:53] will not be ashamed that will not be
[1:31:55] afraid and yes you will be hidden yes
[1:31:57] she will be bruised but she will walk on
[1:32:00] anyway because she is an invincible Army
[1:32:03] that's what I see what do you see I
[1:32:07] don't see a man that came that spoke
[1:32:09] Kentucky English that came with
[1:32:13] I see Christ coming and using a broken
[1:32:16] vessel to bring his word out and open it
[1:32:19] up to me that I can come into the same
[1:32:21] Authority that he had when he was here
[1:32:24] in flesh
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:26] that's what I see
[1:32:28] what do you see
[1:32:29] what do you say of this message called
[1:32:32] Christ what do you think it is
[1:32:35] it'd be a shame for a disciple to sit
[1:32:37] there and go hungry we read about that
[1:32:39] in the Book of Matthew they would be
[1:32:41] there and say Lord have per Adventure
[1:32:43] send these away
[1:32:44] that they go buy their own food
[1:32:46] we don't have food to feed them Paul
[1:32:49] it's like the whole church came over the
[1:32:50] house and we've got some
[1:32:52] samalto meal and
[1:32:56] what are we gonna do with them
[1:32:57] we don't have money Judas what do we got
[1:32:59] nothing
[1:33:01] you better send them home
[1:33:03] well it'd be a shame if that was the end
[1:33:06] of the story
[1:33:08] and Christ just said you're right send
[1:33:09] them home
[1:33:11] but he said what do you got
[1:33:15] all right what do you got I've got a
[1:33:17] little bit of faith
[1:33:18] I'm barely here
[1:33:20] okay
[1:33:22] we can work with it
[1:33:23] bring it to me
[1:33:26] what do you say bring it to me
[1:33:28] you see in his hands
[1:33:30] a few fishes and a few loaves goes a
[1:33:33] long way if there was 10 000 people
[1:33:36] there he would have fed him if there was
[1:33:38] 50 000 people there he would have fed
[1:33:40] him there was only 5 000 people there so
[1:33:42] he said I can make this work for 5 000
[1:33:45] people so you might just have a little
[1:33:46] bit of Faith but in his hands it can do
[1:33:49] whatever you want it to do it can move a
[1:33:52] mountain if you could have faith as the
[1:33:54] grade of a mustard seed and put it in
[1:33:56] his hands and say to this mountain be
[1:33:58] thou removed and do not doubt in your
[1:34:00] heart it shall be given unto you amen so
[1:34:04] you might just be here with a little bit
[1:34:05] of Faith but put it in his hands it'd be
[1:34:08] a shame for those disciples to eat their
[1:34:10] Five Loaves and Fishes and walk away
[1:34:11] still hungry and never have helped
[1:34:13] anybody
[1:34:15] and Christ being right there in their
[1:34:17] midst how about us how many services
[1:34:19] have we come in service after service
[1:34:21] and we want something from the Lord but
[1:34:23] we feel that maybe where job is this or
[1:34:25] distractions this or our faith is this
[1:34:27] or this is damaged and this and this and
[1:34:29] this and this and this and this
[1:34:31] and Christ is here in our midst
[1:34:34] and we have not
[1:34:36] because we ask not
[1:34:38] he said give it to me
[1:34:40] get me what you got
[1:34:41] and I'll work with it
[1:34:43] give me what faith you do have and I'll
[1:34:46] multiply it and I'll multiply it and
[1:34:48] I'll multiply it give me give me your
[1:34:50] patience and I'll add under your virtue
[1:34:55] give me your godliness and I'll give you
[1:34:56] the brotherly kindness give me what you
[1:34:58] got and I'll give you the rest you see
[1:35:00] we've got something to do we've got to
[1:35:02] bring it to him those fishes and loves
[1:35:03] came from somewhere right they brought
[1:35:05] him to the Lord and He multiplied them
[1:35:07] so let's bring our faith to the Lord
[1:35:10] tonight and let him multiply it that we
[1:35:13] could have what we need he's not a God
[1:35:16] that's saying I want you to need I want
[1:35:18] you to walk out the door and still have
[1:35:19] a need God wants you to be satisfied
[1:35:21] under his word draw on El Shady eye that
[1:35:25] you could be nourished is what the
[1:35:26] prophet said he doesn't want you to go
[1:35:28] away thirsty or hungry or wanting but
[1:35:30] come to the house of the Lord hungry in
[1:35:32] expectation and he will satisfy the
[1:35:35] hunger that you have within you
[1:35:38] that's why we come to church
[1:35:40] that's why I come to the house of God I
[1:35:42] don't come to I certainly don't come to
[1:35:44] hear myself or even the preacher or the
[1:35:45] songs being some I came because there's
[1:35:48] a promise that if I could come into that
[1:35:50] atmosphere and that atmosphere is
[1:35:51] created by the worshipers that recognize
[1:35:54] that Jesus is Alive and Well and he's
[1:35:56] not in a cemetery somewhere and they
[1:35:58] worship him like he's a present Living
[1:36:00] God and he comes into that room and
[1:36:02] under that atmosphere I can bring him my
[1:36:05] little faith I can bring in my alabaster
[1:36:07] box and let him do what he wants with it
[1:36:10] I can bring him everything that I have
[1:36:12] and say lord it's not much but here you
[1:36:14] go Lord take what you will take what
[1:36:17] take everything from me and multiply it
[1:36:19] that I could leave a whole person and
[1:36:21] the next service we do it again
[1:36:23] until the changing of our bodies I
[1:36:27] believe a service we're going to walk in
[1:36:28] here or maybe don't feel like we have
[1:36:30] much faith brother Brian we might feel
[1:36:31] like it's just a regular service but
[1:36:32] will have a portion of faith that will
[1:36:34] bring to the king and we'll say here's
[1:36:36] my portion of faith I reckon I see this
[1:36:38] in the word this is what I want
[1:36:42] it took 10 days
[1:36:44] for them to all get in one Accord it's
[1:36:46] taken us about 40 Years to all get in
[1:36:49] one Accord that we have one anticipation
[1:36:51] need and it's for the changing of our
[1:36:53] bodies Lord this is my focus this
[1:36:56] morning this is what I have and this is
[1:36:58] what I'm offering for it and the Lord
[1:37:00] will take that and he will multiply it
[1:37:01] and he will multiply it and he will
[1:37:04] multiply and you would think as the
[1:37:05] disciples they would be so encouraged
[1:37:07] that they would let light the world on
[1:37:08] fire with what God's done
[1:37:11] but they get in a boat and they go
[1:37:13] sailing across the sea and that very
[1:37:15] same night they see Jesus walking on the
[1:37:18] water
[1:37:19] you know sometimes we get under an
[1:37:21] atmosphere and the Lord comes down and
[1:37:22] we think I'll never doubt them again
[1:37:24] I've seen too much how this this
[1:37:26] anointing that was in this building uh
[1:37:27] just my the healings that have taken
[1:37:30] place in that prayer line and the
[1:37:31] anointing power of God but they just
[1:37:33] give it a couple days for them it was
[1:37:35] the same day
[1:37:36] and they're sitting in this boat and
[1:37:37] they see the same one who who multiplied
[1:37:40] the fishes and the loaves walking on the
[1:37:42] water and they cry out for fear
[1:37:46] because they don't believe
[1:37:48] is it you who else is it going to be
[1:37:51] it's the guy who just multiplied the
[1:37:53] fishes in the loaves we don't need a
[1:37:56] what better sign from Heaven do we need
[1:37:58] we I think sometimes we sit in our Pew
[1:38:00] and expect an Angelic light to fall and
[1:38:02] cast upon our shoulder and say our name
[1:38:04] in an audible voice so we're not going
[1:38:06] to be moved well who else is it that
[1:38:08] stirs your heart and brought you here
[1:38:10] and revealed to you the word and showed
[1:38:12] you that it was about you and showed you
[1:38:14] that there was an Exit Plan and showed
[1:38:16] you that this is all about you and it's
[1:38:18] a love book to you who else shows you
[1:38:19] that it's Christ what more do we need
[1:38:22] than for him to just take us out of here
[1:38:24] but we've got to recognize it's me
[1:38:27] if God never came and did another
[1:38:29] Supernatural thing in my life Don't Take
[1:38:31] Your Presence for me Lord but if you
[1:38:33] never did
[1:38:34] I trust him anyway you know why because
[1:38:36] he showed me enough by now that I know
[1:38:39] without a shadow of a doubt that it is
[1:38:42] true and it is for me and though he slay
[1:38:45] me yet I'll trust him but if he's coming
[1:38:47] back for one I believe it's me if he
[1:38:49] never visits me again I believe that
[1:38:51] with all my heart because God will not
[1:38:54] change and if he ever showed it to me
[1:38:56] once he will keep his word today
[1:38:59] he's not going to change on you say well
[1:39:01] I showed you this Revelation 40 years
[1:39:02] ago but I've changed it today not God
[1:39:04] he's the same
[1:39:06] he does the same thing by the same way
[1:39:09] he did it the first time or he's not
[1:39:12] perfect right but he is perfect and so
[1:39:14] the way he did it the first time is the
[1:39:16] correct way and he will do it that way
[1:39:19] again
[1:39:20] the only variable is us
[1:39:22] that's the only variable in this is our
[1:39:24] faith
[1:39:28] so then they find themselves on the
[1:39:29] water and they're they're looking out
[1:39:31] and I said you yeah Peter said if it is
[1:39:33] you then bid me come what a challenge
[1:39:38] if this really is true that bit me to
[1:39:40] come well you better be ready
[1:39:43] come
[1:39:44] on
[1:39:46] come walk with me a while
[1:39:50] what have been Peter's a fisherman
[1:39:52] he knows the water you know I mean he's
[1:39:54] seen drowned in the Sea of Galilee
[1:39:57] he knows
[1:39:59] he knows that that first step could be
[1:40:01] his last
[1:40:03] and he's strong in faith he's just seen
[1:40:05] the Loaves and the and the fishes and
[1:40:08] his faith is high
[1:40:10] and so he steps out on the water walking
[1:40:12] on that inspiration of faith
[1:40:14] and he makes it out their ways
[1:40:17] but then Jesus isn't performing the
[1:40:19] Wonders maybe in the middle of the ocean
[1:40:21] and he's just standing there looking at
[1:40:24] Peter
[1:40:25] and Peter begins to come to himself
[1:40:29] I'm standing in the middle of the sea
[1:40:32] and begins to sink
[1:40:34] you see we can't rely on what God did
[1:40:37] yesterday
[1:40:38] we've got to see what he's doing today
[1:40:40] and so he said yesterday he he
[1:40:42] multiplied this and multiplied that but
[1:40:44] what is he doing today well he's
[1:40:46] standing in the middle of the sea is
[1:40:48] that not enough Peter
[1:40:50] and he begins to sink down
[1:40:52] and the Lord says why have you gone
[1:40:54] afraid
[1:40:55] where's your faith gone from you
[1:40:58] is it not enough that I'm standing in
[1:40:59] the middle of the sea and you've already
[1:41:01] made it all the way out here what
[1:41:02] brought you this far Peter
[1:41:04] right
[1:41:06] now the Bible leaves that it says when
[1:41:09] they return to the ship the wind ceased
[1:41:11] right
[1:41:12] didn't say the wind ceased in that
[1:41:14] moment and Peter was okay
[1:41:17] but the Lord says why have you feared
[1:41:19] why have you doubted
[1:41:22] I brought you this far
[1:41:25] I'll bring you back to the boat
[1:41:27] now I don't know if he was holding his
[1:41:29] hand on the way back or how that
[1:41:30] transpired but Peter got the faith to
[1:41:33] come up out of that water and walk back
[1:41:35] to the boat because if the Lord brought
[1:41:37] you this far he'll see you all the way
[1:41:40] back to the harbor if the Lord brought
[1:41:41] you out of denomination he's going to
[1:41:44] take you all the way in our trust has
[1:41:46] got to recognize that he's not going to
[1:41:48] leave us in the middle of an ocean
[1:41:49] somewhere that he's he's forsaken us so
[1:41:52] forgot about us what if Jesus brother
[1:41:54] Paul would have just walked away from
[1:41:55] Peter and left him in the middle of the
[1:41:57] ocean he would have drowned but he said
[1:41:59] I'll never leave you I'll be right here
[1:42:01] and Jesus didn't say anything until
[1:42:03] Peter began to doubt he said Peter
[1:42:04] where's your faith
[1:42:06] love is corrective always
[1:42:09] brother bear says it probably five six
[1:42:10] times love is corrective Peter where's
[1:42:13] your face see the love of God to reach
[1:42:15] out and challenge us where's your Faith
[1:42:17] Church are you ready to challenge me at
[1:42:20] my authority are you ready to challenge
[1:42:21] me on what my power can do where's your
[1:42:24] faith church and he tells Peter you've
[1:42:26] already come this far and you're going
[1:42:28] to disbelieve me now and Peter rising up
[1:42:31] in faith says yay Lord I'll walk back to
[1:42:33] the boat with you I would just put
[1:42:35] myself in Peter's shoes for a moment
[1:42:37] Lord up and down lord I've been beaten
[1:42:39] up I've been lied about I've been
[1:42:41] criticized everything you can think of
[1:42:43] has been plagued me and I'm just seeking
[1:42:45] a little low and the Lord doesn't want
[1:42:46] to hear my whiny story he says Peter
[1:42:48] where's your faith
[1:42:51] I brought you this far the only way
[1:42:54] you're going to make it back is to get
[1:42:55] to the same faith that brought you here
[1:42:57] is the same faith that you could turn
[1:42:59] around with and walk back to the boat
[1:43:03] it's not about how sympathetic our story
[1:43:05] is we all have a story and God cares but
[1:43:08] God cares about our faith in the middle
[1:43:10] of the storm the winds didn't cease
[1:43:12] until Peter made it back to the boat
[1:43:17] so if you're looking for the storm just
[1:43:18] depart and it for just to be a flowery
[1:43:21] bed of ease
[1:43:23] that's not where Christ is
[1:43:25] he's in the middle
[1:43:27] of the storm
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:30] he's not out there in a silent place a
[1:43:33] cemetery
[1:43:35] looking for him in the dead things and
[1:43:36] traditions of the world saying well
[1:43:38] maybe he's here maybe he's he's there or
[1:43:41] we'll go look for him over here but
[1:43:44] he's right in the middle of the storm
[1:43:50] believe that
[1:43:53] it's for us
[1:43:56] if it's not for anybody else
[1:43:58] the rest of the disciples didn't have
[1:44:00] the faith to challenge him to say
[1:44:03] if it's you call me
[1:44:07] I wonder how many of us have said within
[1:44:08] our faith Lord if this is you
[1:44:11] call me
[1:44:14] take me
[1:44:15] we walk out by faith
[1:44:17] we get out there a little bit whoo
[1:44:22] Mr Browning what was it like when you
[1:44:23] guys started a church
[1:44:24] Lord if this is you
[1:44:26] call us
[1:44:27] get out there a little bit in the water
[1:44:30] this is deep
[1:44:33] we're going to be treading here in a
[1:44:35] moment
[1:44:35] but the same God that anointed you to be
[1:44:37] where you're sitting tonight
[1:44:39] is right by your side and he's saying
[1:44:42] where has your faith gone the same
[1:44:44] anointing that brought you this far will
[1:44:46] take you all the way
[1:44:49] the same quickening power
[1:44:52] is the resurrection of our faith because
[1:44:55] that's what this is all about right
[1:44:56] restore our faith
[1:44:58] back to the Faith of Our Fathers we're
[1:45:01] the children of this of this message and
[1:45:03] we're to have our faith restored back to
[1:45:06] the fathers that it was once given to
[1:45:08] right Peter where's your faith
[1:45:11] come back onto the boat with me
[1:45:13] come back onto the boat with me my
[1:45:16] goodness predestination and power right
[1:45:18] there
[1:45:19] brother I must say
[1:45:21] now the predestinated ones are the first
[1:45:24] to be quickened by the Holy Spirit and
[1:45:26] the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own
[1:45:27] now this is deep now be sure to catch
[1:45:29] this good I'm trying to close here now
[1:45:31] as the sun went set across the Earth not
[1:45:33] to bring rocks which was dirt also it
[1:45:36] was not to bring all the dirt to life
[1:45:38] but was to bring the part of the dirt
[1:45:41] which wasn't closed around the life
[1:45:46] Not all men will receive Christ
[1:45:49] oh no but those which God foreordained
[1:45:53] life is housed around some of the dirt
[1:45:56] of the earth and that's the one he comes
[1:45:59] to Quicken
[1:46:00] they are the ones
[1:46:02] that now that dirt would lay there in
[1:46:05] the Sun and say oh this old sun is so
[1:46:08] hot and that rock would say this old sun
[1:46:10] is so hot but that little seat said
[1:46:13] that's what I'm looking for and it began
[1:46:16] to Spring forth to life it quickened
[1:46:18] that part of the dirt because the sun
[1:46:20] was sent not to Quicken The Rock and not
[1:46:23] to Quicken the dirt
[1:46:24] but to Quicken the life of the seed
[1:46:30] now the Holy Spirit comes now it wasn't
[1:46:32] sent to everyone why won't all the
[1:46:34] people receive it it wasn't sent to them
[1:46:38] but it was sent to you
[1:46:40] do you see it
[1:46:44] do you see election
[1:46:46] then it's for you
[1:46:49] do you see that election is the love of
[1:46:51] God
[1:46:53] then it's for you
[1:46:56] I see it I can't explain it I can't put
[1:46:59] it into words right right but I know
[1:47:01] that I would not be here by my own my
[1:47:04] own intellect or my own faith or my own
[1:47:06] ability to overcome situations and
[1:47:08] problems I see the elective love of God
[1:47:11] in my life that he's brought me this far
[1:47:13] out here and if he brought me this far
[1:47:15] he's not going to leave me here because
[1:47:17] God is the author and the finisher of
[1:47:21] our faith and so right now we might be
[1:47:23] in the middle of the Sea of Galilee
[1:47:24] wondering how we're going to get out of
[1:47:26] it but he who started it will finish the
[1:47:28] work of what she started in you so if
[1:47:31] God brought you out here don't think
[1:47:32] that he's forsaken you now if God
[1:47:34] brought you into a partial Victory don't
[1:47:36] stop there but go all the way in to the
[1:47:39] to Total victory in the word of God
[1:47:42] he who started it will finish it his
[1:47:46] love has elected you to it do you see it
[1:47:49] the prophet would say do you see a
[1:47:51] church do you see the love of God
[1:47:52] throughout your life we can pass the mic
[1:47:55] and we could ask everybody in here
[1:47:56] what's God done for you and you and you
[1:47:59] and you
[1:48:02] wish Brother Ray was here he would have
[1:48:03] stood up and
[1:48:04] I'll tell you what he's done
[1:48:08] but those are what make us who we are
[1:48:12] I I love testimonies of what God's done
[1:48:14] in people's life because if they he did
[1:48:16] it for them he can do it for me
[1:48:18] and and it never fails somebody will
[1:48:21] share a testimony with me and within a
[1:48:23] few weeks I'll run into somebody that is
[1:48:25] having the same problem and I'll say you
[1:48:27] know what
[1:48:28] a couple weeks ago a brother shared a
[1:48:30] testimony with me because if he did it
[1:48:32] for him he can do it for you
[1:48:36] do you see the love of God in your life
[1:48:38] so if you see the hand of God's love in
[1:48:41] your life then it's for you and if God's
[1:48:43] love is set upon you what can stop you
[1:48:48] what can stand against you God wants you
[1:48:50] to walk out of here in total victory
[1:48:53] total victory
[1:48:55] is loves for you
[1:48:57] we're not fearful to put our name with
[1:48:59] it we're not afraid to stand with it
[1:49:02] we're not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:49:04] Christ we don't want to be identified in
[1:49:06] the fearful scripture we don't want to
[1:49:08] carry our own fears about what about
[1:49:09] what about if I try and it doesn't work
[1:49:13] I believe that's one of the greatest
[1:49:14] crutches against the Church of the
[1:49:15] Living God is the fear of failure
[1:49:18] what if I try
[1:49:20] and it's not me
[1:49:22] what if I'm Not Elected what if I'm not
[1:49:24] do you see that you are
[1:49:28] then it's for you
[1:49:31] don't link yourself up with the fear
[1:49:34] because perfect love
[1:49:36] casteth out all
[1:49:40] fear if we can stand to our feet tonight
[1:49:44] We're Not Afraid
[1:49:46] we know where we're standing
[1:49:49] I'm not ashamed to put my name with it
[1:49:50] and say I I believe God's A Healer
[1:49:53] brother Paul
[1:49:55] I've put my name on the line with him
[1:49:57] because my name means nothing his name
[1:49:59] means everything
[1:50:02] and if he said
[1:50:05] that it was the same spirit in this age
[1:50:07] that would do the Greater Works
[1:50:10] then I'm not ashamed to put my name next
[1:50:11] to that but the Paul was there in a
[1:50:13] service Sunday morning we prayed for
[1:50:15] many cases
[1:50:17] many cases
[1:50:19] God may not heal all those people Paul
[1:50:22] but I'm going to pray for the same
[1:50:23] amount of people the next time
[1:50:26] but but one Faith reaching out
[1:50:29] with the same response will bring the
[1:50:32] same reaction
[1:50:34] he'll do the Greater Works
[1:50:38] well you say well brother you know
[1:50:39] you're just trying to increase people's
[1:50:41] hopes
[1:50:44] do you see it
[1:50:46] I see it
[1:50:48] I see a church walking
[1:50:50] victoriously in the word
[1:50:53] I see a church without spot a wrinkle
[1:50:56] you know why because the love is
[1:50:59] covering her
[1:51:00] the love of God how rich and pure
[1:51:03] how miserless and strong
[1:51:06] that even when I didn't love him and I
[1:51:08] wasn't looking for him he loved me
[1:51:10] that's what brother Brown would just
[1:51:11] sing it all the time
[1:51:13] I
[1:51:15] love him
[1:51:18] ah
[1:51:21] I love him
[1:51:25] because
[1:51:28] he first
[1:51:31] love me
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:38] and her
[1:51:41] just my salvation
[1:51:46] [Music]
[1:51:50] oh God
[1:51:53] uh freeze
[1:51:57] trees
[1:52:01] you know let's just sing it to him
[1:52:06] I
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:12] love him
[1:52:16] here because
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:26] salvation
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:39] oh God
[1:52:43] Calvary
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:54] love
[1:52:56] him oh
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:03] happy
[1:53:04] [Music]
[1:53:18] [Applause]
[1:53:19] [Music]
[1:53:26] because

[1:53:44] we thank you that it's the binder of all
[1:53:46] things
[1:53:48] Lord It's that Capstone love that's
[1:53:50] coming down in this age Lord we just we
[1:53:52] can't explain it we can't put it into
[1:53:54] words but Lord there's a greater love
[1:53:57] it's the harder way
[1:54:00] Lord but you spoke to your prophet and
[1:54:03] said that because he had chosen the
[1:54:06] harder way he would have a tremendous
[1:54:07] victory in the love divine Lord I
[1:54:10] believe it's the same for us tonight
[1:54:12] Lord It's the harder way
[1:54:15] but it's your way father
[1:54:17] Lord I asked it
[1:54:19] Lord we would have above all more love
[1:54:22] father
[1:54:24] Lord for your word says that perfect
[1:54:26] love brings perfect Faith Lord that's
[1:54:28] what we desire father it's going to take
[1:54:30] a perfect Faith to change our bodies and
[1:54:33] to bring back the prodigals and restore
[1:54:35] broken families and hopes and dreams and
[1:54:38] shattered bodies and
[1:54:41] bruised Minds father it's going to take
[1:54:43] perfect faith and Lord that perfect
[1:54:45] faith will only come by perfect love
[1:54:47] father and Lord we want more Love
[1:54:49] Tonight father I pray Lord that you
[1:54:53] would just give an extra measure of love
[1:54:55] father to each one in this building

[1:55:00] let your sweeping Angel just come by and
[1:55:02] Lord we'd reach out and say Lord I I

[1:55:07] aside everything else and say Lord Give
[1:55:09] Me Love

[1:55:29] that peace Father
[1:55:31] Lord let us just bind together one
[1:55:33] another in love Lord

[1:55:37] believer spoken word Tabernacle and
[1:55:39] you'd give it a greater measure of love
[1:55:41] than they've ever known father Lord I
[1:55:43] pray that you bind them together in a
[1:55:45] greater Fellowship Lord arm and arm with
[1:55:47] one another Lord marching towards your
[1:55:50] coming word Lord saying soon and very
[1:55:52] soon we shall go to see the king that's
[1:55:54] our desire Lord and we'll only get there
[1:55:56] by a highway of Love Lord
[1:55:59] father me you take us higher Lord
[1:56:02] many of us might be in the middle of the
[1:56:03] Sea of Galilee as it were father
[1:56:05] wondering where you are if you're still
[1:56:08] around us but Lord Your Love Never Fails

[1:56:37] Rapture of the church

[1:56:42] culmination all of these Revelations
[1:56:44] which have been taught over the years

[1:56:47] love that'll bring a resurrection father
[1:56:49] it's love that'll Inspire the words and
[1:56:52] the faith oh god father we're asking

[1:57:03] few fishes to bring but Lord we're
[1:57:05] putting them in your hands father
