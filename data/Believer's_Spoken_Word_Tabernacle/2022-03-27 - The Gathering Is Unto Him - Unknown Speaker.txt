your majesty to be still and know you're in this place please let me stand rest in your holiness word [Music] oh i like the snow myself you know that but we're getting more daylight in the evening brother samuel i don't like the snow hey i'm a bible man though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow so every time we look out and see the snow oh it's only you see the rainbow we had a rainbow it was a friday was it friday at the how friday at the house we look out and we're just standing looking at the rainbow that's god made a sign that was a covenant so the you know the snow was not made for weather forecasters you know snow wasn't made so that the body shop guys can get work it all has its own purpose and things but it's a reminder when you look at that snow though thy sins be a scarlet they shall be a whitest nose so maybe the next time when we're shoveling the snow or blowing it we'll just say thank you lord jesus for washing away my sins [Laughter] oh my don't you love him amen it's so good to be here so good to see each and every one of you let's just stand and let's just turn our attention in our hearts to the word of the lord amen let's just go to him in prayer heavenly father lord jesus as we just come lord in these moments lord just before you lord just desiring of your mercies o god once again today father i pray that god that you'll just come among us lord just move among us in a very special way lord this morning father we thank you for lord each and every service we thank you lord for how that you are moving among us but lord we need you once again lord you know and you see the needs that are before us requests are upon the hearts of your children lord we ask that you will come lord father we just lord our our confession is lord that we just surrender to you we'll just submit ourselves to you lord we want to come so fully under that word oh god and lord we pray that you'll just take speaker in here this morning speak through us lord hear through us o god let it be lord fathers you just sat down where hearts are being discerned lord lord god where thoughts lord are being made known because within all of that that you lord conveying your love and your care to our lives lord your prophet would put that very scripture of hebrews 4 12 and tie it together to your how personal you are that as you know the numbers of the hairs on our head and he would tie that into how precise the word of god is lord in our lives lord we thank you for that lord oh god we just invite you that you'll just just minister to us lord every one of us together we just invite you lord and we're just lord believing that every need that's gathered here this morning lord it's already met and we just ask oh god that that evidence that faith would just drop in our hearts oh god that just as it settled it settled granted lord we pray father may you just lord have your way now in jesus precious name amen amen let's turn in our bibles if you would ephesians chapter one i have a few scriptures to read through here ephesians one verse 3 is where i'd like to begin blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ these first four verses we're going to read paul is writing this under inspiration this is a very is a parallels exactly for the children of israel when they would come into their land remember the scriptures as bible readers remember in joshua 1 joshua was to divide the inheritance by inspiration so what belonged to them that tribe it wasn't that when they came into the land that oh my you know god's just making up his mind no where they're blessing lay was in the land and so when they would come there joshua would come under that same inspiration of god that struck the hebrew mothers when they were giving birth and they would call out the name ruben gad or ephraim that same inspiration so joshua is there to bring forth that same inspiration to place the people in the land of promise so these first four verses is what is already settled in the mind of god because where we're at this is an outworking of god's drama are you with me we don't know you know you and i can look at certain things we see certain things this event or this or that and we see this one see that you or i don't know all of these other things you don't know who is and who isn't this is why it has to be just personal for our lives it's personal for our lives it's an outworking it's coming back to what god has for us so let's look here at verse 3 once again blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption that's the placement of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom now notice verse 7 now here's where to bring this to pass now as paul could say in verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood so in order to come back into this there had to come one from glory god had to come down and there had to be a shedding of blood life had to be given in order to bring us make a way that we can come back in to our inheritance there was no way to get back without god coming down and that's the grace of god in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace how many is thankful he's rich in grace oh i'm thankful for that wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation this is where i'm just moving to in verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance remember brother branham was very clear about this and laying it out he says jesus never left me an inheritance he brought me to my inheritance my inheritance was before the foundation of the world but jesus brought me to my inheritance who is it that brings you and i to our inheritance today the lord jesus the holy spirit brings you an eye and ties us back into our inheritance in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'm not going to ask you to turn there but i'm going to read three verses out of first thessalonians 4 where i've been reading here for a few weeks but here in verse 16 the announcement for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words i want to draw from from this this whole text that we've read and just draw a context from here and there's multiple things that i could speak or call this but i want to just speak on the gathering is unto him the gathering is unto him and so when we look at this of the shout this that god opens in this generation paul was was given this revelation there in first thessalonians 4 but in this generation it's open to us because this is the season of the rapture we are living in the coming of the lord the church of the living god since since there as he was he ascended up and they made their way to pentecost and under the direction of of the vindicated word and they received the promise the church of the living god down through the ages has lived with an expectation of the coming of the lord and this and this of where you and i are at in this hour of how that god in his grace makes known to you and i that this is the hour this is the season now we think about it how many years have passed even since god has taken the messenger off the scene uh you know some here we have you know some 57 years that we're coming up on that has been gone off the scene but remember the messenger to that age because is the one who influences that age to christ because before the ephesian age started paul was already gone paul had already been taken off the scene but he was the messenger for the ephesian age a message that was to influence that age back to jesus christ so when we look at that that ministry that's why that every true messenger down through time it must fall follow that same pattern that god gave through paul and in this hour that we're living in the revelation of this rapture is open to you and i that to recognize that he himself the lord himself as he is descending and we can take this not by our own mental abilities but because god by divine inspiration has taken the promises that have laid scattered throughout the scripture and pointed for this hour and tie them together that this is part of a single event of the lord himself descending it is the mighty angel of revelations 10 1 that has come down so there's all three as brother branham would say he does all three while he's descending that's why this message that you and i have received it is truly the end time message and i think we can say it very clearly we are at the end of the end time we are here in the in this place we're recognizing and not just from the things that we're seeing but we catch it of how that god is moving and stirring in our hearts and this is where we are at in this junction or in this moment of the unfolding of the rapture we are living in the shout the message that has gone forth and if i can say it in this way we're not only living in the shout we are the shout we are the manifestation of the shout of the living god that has come among us because that shout is the very reproducing of the life of jesus christ in its fullness and it is the gathering unto himself because we are getting ready for the greatest migration that's ever hit the face of the earth we're getting ready to leave we're getting together and there's a place reserved that god has reserved to himself that place that you and i are being gathered to is in christ under the blood and so when we look at these scriptures here in in ephesians and thessalonians i i just i'm going to refer to out of the message the paradox and remembering take taking this thought with you that there's always a coming out and there's a going in there's two parts to redemption it's coming out of the world and going fully into christ because we can't go into christ as long as we're in the world but god brings us out of the world he takes the world out of us that he might place himself inside of us so it's all a work of redemption he's claiming what belongs to him so there's always that two parts of redemption and that's what brother adam is speaking about here in the message paradox and he's speaking of how god has made promises to us in this hour through revelations 10 through malachi 4 that there has to come an ephesians to all of this too what has been down through the church ages there's got to come in ephesians you say what are you talking about in ephesians we're talking about and entering into fully back into the promises of god there's got to be a deliverance come to the church of the living god there's got to be in ephesians to all this you see there's been three exodus there's been one exodus or you can say ephesians already where god sent a message down to egypt and he called them out of egypt and then they had to go into the land of canaan the message was not just come out of egypt but the message was come out and go into then there was the second exodus and god sent a man by the name of john the baptist to declare the second exodus is at hand and he's calling him out of a natural land this is the second exodus second ephesians he's calling him out of a natural land into the baptism of the holy ghost because it wasn't just enough just to be in the land of canaan that was only a type that would speak of the holy ghost a place where the believer was to dwell in him and so that second effort ephesians that second exodus is a is a translating from a natural land into the baptism of the holy ghost and where we stand in this hour in the third exodus or the third ephesians it is a moving from the baptism of the holy ghost into the promise in my father's house are many mansions so there's been these three three three ephesians these three exodus and we are in the third ephesians or the third exodus even right now and grace and this i want you to just just lock into this here for a moment in every one of these ephesians grace provided what was needed to make the journey i'd say god let that drop so fully let it stick to the fifth rib in my life because it's grace that's providing all along it'll be grace that morning when one of those lights sweep down and are changing the very atoms of your body it is grace that has provided for us throughout this journey grace provided them with the prophet grace provided them with the pillar of fire grace provided them with a sacrificial lamb to take them out of egypt think about it when they went down to the mightiest nation in the world and here god sends a message he gets a man separated from his own thinking from his own reason because remember moses was trying to do it on his own he was ye you know he he took one egyptian out but that's what his intellect did but when he could get before the presence of god and he not just heard about him now he saw him he was made manifest right before him and when he when he was made manifest before him that's why in more in less than five minutes there was more that took place in moses life than all the other years he spent down in egypt oh my you can never underestimate the presence of almighty god we must have his presence the quickening power must be here we must invite him and say lord that you would come grace has provided this and here stood moses in that moment when in his intellect he whipped one man but under the grace of god the shekinah glory they're receiving apart and red and and there how god moved in his life he goes down with a message to announce to them deliverance how can he announce deliverance because he himself has experienced deliverance so what he's preaching he is an example of it are you hearing me that's why the prophet could say the message and the messenger are one in the same hey listen that ain't just for the messenger and the message that's for the pastor in the message that's for every believer in the message the message in you are not to be two different people it's to be one voice altogether is to be the same as to be the amen in our life and he goes down there and defeats a whole nation who defeated a whole nation god did who brought them out god did but god told moses i just need to borrow you what do you need me to do i just need you to believe me and obey me what i tell you to do just do it you can't make it come to pass but if you'll just do it i'll come behind and it will be declared that it's not a man's doing but it's my doing joshua was there the whole time see when they came out of egypt they went through the the wilderness we know the spies went out to spy into the land and they went over there and they looked in the land and all they saw well those pine all they saw was giants except for joshua and caleb see joshua himself being a type of the end time messenger now follow me now being a type of the holy ghost in this hour are you hearing me caleb was inspired not by the things that he saw in the natural he was inspired to look beyond those things and he could see there is not a giant too big for my god all he could see is i already heard what the messenger spoke he said this is mine these are my redemptive rights that i'm going to take what belongs to me because he realized he wanted moses saying it he recognized this is god speaking through his prophet glory be to god in the highest so joshua was there the whole time joshua was right there in the camp joshua representing grace moses representing the law and to understand i'm just going to maybe have to read a few places here out of the message the paradox because i don't want this thought to be lost but joshua was representing grace and he says as uh it was right along with the law but it could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place and he says so is it with as the church world in this last days it's come along it's played its part but there's coming a time it's got to cease there's got to be in ephesians of this journey just as there was other journeys there's got to come in ephesians and ephesus to this journey wherein the law could never save a sinner as i pointed out is that true the law could say you're guilty he could go offer up the blood of an innocent one but he still went out with the same desires he was never free that's why there had to come the blood of jesus that could reach down and deal with the root of the problem not keep snapping off the dandelion snapping it off snapping it off but a blood that could come down and deal with the sin question once and for all but god gave that as a provision looking forward to that perfect the antitype of the blood to come therefore he says the promised land represented a day of grace but he could not moses could not take them in into that journey and he says if you noticed in that journey they had three stages first was the preparation by faith down in egypt under a sacrificial lamb then they crossed the red sea the wilderness a separation which represented another stage of the journey so they come out of egypt they come through up to the red sea and at the red sea what takes place at the red sea god opens a way that the task masters the habits and and everything that was ruling over their life god opened the red sea speaking of the blood of the lord jesus because it's the blood that sanctifies and god opened that pathway man couldn't open that pathway man could not clean himself up and make himself a fit candidate for god but god remember grace provides and here grace providing and the red sea how is the red sea open god hear the word is spoken and as the word is spoken through the lips of a mortal man but it's not man's word the sea opens oh lord i wish i had time to really just camp down on this for a moment you see when we're looking at it in our lives there's some things that can stand in front of you are you hearing me this morning there's things that can stand in front of you along your journey let me just say this don't check out if you say brother samuel i don't know if i've went all the way don't check out this is for everybody there are things that you have got to stand there that are facing right in front of you you need to speak the word to that situation you're given authority to address it that word that can be spoken it can be confession confess your sin he's faithful and just to forgive you that devil that stands there like a big old boogeyman when you'll take god at his word you'll find the rushing mighty wind go to work and dismiss him out of the way we've got to take god at his word and speak to that thing and let god come behind it in that second stage of the journey god opened up that way for them and what was happening what was happening in this journey they there was more distance between them and the world but samuel that's pretty simple i know it is i thank god it is but you see in order to get over to the promised land they couldn't just come right out on the border of egypt they had to walk toward the promise and as you walk toward the promise come on now i'm talking about in your life then once you walk towards him the world and you becomes further separated come on young people order a light this is applying the basis the basis the simple abcs of the word of god it's walk toward him look unto him who is the author and finisher of your faith and if you keep your eyes on him instead of just dwelling there well i don't feel worthy and i don't know if i am that's a mind battle that's a mind battle and satan's only doing that to try to hang it over your head what do i have to do i would look to him i would look to the one who's speaking to me and start making some footsteps start bringing distance between yourself and the world i feel like preaching boy now you see they come up into that place they were all under preparation but as they come there they come to the red sea and brother graham said there was a failure again the people didn't believe after they saw all these signs i'm telling you they walked out of egypt the greatest power on earth nation and they were delivered by the blood of the lamb whoo it didn't matter how massive and how great and how structured the army was it was no match for the blood of the lamb and how did the blood come the blood of the lamb the pathway was revealed through the message of the hour glory be to god it was revealed in that hour this is the way out it never you see the gospel never leaves the blood because the gospel is based on the blood and the blood runs a trail clear back to the lamb's book of life from the beginning that's why when the holy ghost is come it ties you back in to your inheritance it's the blood trail the scarlet cord that runs clear all the way on back the red sea here they come they come to a place they should have had faith but instead they stand there oh you brought us out here to die all this is going on oh look at look at pharaoh's army look at all this and they were and there was a failure that's what law does i said that's what law does because you know why law is based on what you can do what you can control that's why we're not to live by law you can never live a victorious life in christ living by the law now i know when god gets a hold of our life we start out and lose friends we should be sincere but i think you understand what i'm saying maybe for younger ones and older ones alike that when we first started out there's things that were so you know do i do this and do it because the reason is we're desiring to so please him it isn't that we become loose but we begin to recognize wait a minute it's grace that brought me faith this far god never intended me to walk around and bite my nails all the time and wonder if i'm pleasing i have been accepted in the beloved [Applause] that's why god would say and repeat it to joshua as i was with moses and all his failures in all his mistakes i will be with you i will not forsake you oh my my my now notice brother brown said they were baptized they had repented and were baptized they had come out to walk in a new life in a new land in a newness journey among new people and the hand of god was upon them but it finally come to a place in this walk that they had they was not satisfied with their walk of grace and they had to come to something that they could do themselves now listen walk in right here now that's where people think today of divine healing or some other work of grace of god that there is something that you have to do you he says there is nothing you have to do but believe just believe god now let's be real simple here if you knew you know i never lived in florida thank god but brother carlos did and whoever else did and i know when they talk about storms coming up just like our snowstorms that we have here you have snowstorms come in here and oh we need to buy the bread we need to do this and the snow's coming well down in florida it's a little bit different when they talk about a hurricane coming in it's more than buying bread you're trying to make sure you got gas for your generator and you also know that you got to go out and try to beat the rest of them and get that osb board or hopefully you've kept some over you know and because you got to board up the windows is that right brother carlos but you see what if somebody made you an announcement and they said a hurricane's coming you said wow man that's wow that's that's pretty good and i walked on say hey man a hurricane's coming hey buddy a hurricane's coming wow man hurricane's coming i can't get back there to you hurricane's coming wow hurricane's coming and then we go by your house and we see you on the porch with sweet tea i thought you told me there was a hurricane coming oh there is but you see what you're looking for is if you really believed what you're talking about you would go out and get the wood and start putting it on the windows you see belief is not just something we acknowledge but belief is active it moves in action whether i don't even see the hurricane winds i don't even feel them right now but there's already been an announcement and faith moves in action to what i've heard so here when we look at there's nothing you have to do that doesn't mean we just set back it means okay god has said that this is going to be what i need to do you need to go buy the osb but except you know what we don't have to go back god said i've already got it provided all you got to do is surrender and you just receive the osb the board all the screws everything i've got it all provided all you got to do is take it and put it on then when the storm comes i will show up and manifest my glory because you can't just sit in the house and don't put up the wood and the glass is flying in but i thought god said he's going to protect me god said i am your protection i am your stay but you better put my word my you better put the osb on the windows and on the door that's showing you believe is that right now if they would have believed they would have continued on you see the promise was before the law without any conditions to it i have given you this land go on over into it but they got to that promise and they decided there was something they must do themselves [Music] and that we still find that among human beings we're oh i like that we're prone to be that way i said we're prone to be that way you see even after the holy ghost has come and you have followed the grace of god that's given that's brought correction to our life chastening of the lord to bring us to that place as we surrender to his word that he comes and does the full work and there's a real genuine experience in our life it still does not strip away the humanity of even times that we forget wait a minute i didn't do this work in my life i can't do it in this one's life or this one's life but as human beings we're prone to as much as i want to see change in you know lives and hearts and everything i can't make that change come to pass over the same you just lay your hand and pray for them that don't work that way i believe in laying hands on them they laid hands on them and they received the holy ghost but there's got to be preparation on the heart of that individual and that takes the grace of god not the law [Music] we can really learn a big lesson because we're trying to do things and wondering why god ain't coming behind it and god says i ain't going to share my glory with you this is my work it's my doing and when he gives his word he gives his word so as we will obey his word not just agree with it and go around and shake hands but agree with it then what happens when he comes he vindicates the word that he gave to us oh my you love him i'm trying to get somewhere there is something we're prone to be that way how many say god help me let me continue to die to myself there is something we've got to do we feel that we've got to do something into it also you do have something into it that's your surrender of your own will your own idea that's continuously that's continuously to the will and idea now i know friends listen sometimes we want to think every thought that comes our way is this is thus saith the lord the bible said try every spirit try every thought notice this to the will we're to surrender our own will our own idea to the will and idea of almighty god and it's finished see we surrender right there the surrender that's the finish the finish yeah it's the finish of us that's all there is just take his promise don't think of nothing else walk by it and god does the rest now when we think of this i want you to think of these words the believer's achievement the believer's achievement because we recognize the promises this ephesians that we are in in moving back into all the promises of god into that of the rapture the change of the body the millennium all of these things that are great precious promises and it is the anointing of the hour that comes upon the word upon the people of god it's the anointing of the hour the holy ghost and it is the dove of god that is leading us to life it leads us to death to self to a personal calvary crucifying of the flesh with the affections and the lust thereof that we would take up our cross where the pulsation in our lives is not my will be done but thine will be done and being filled with the prevailing power of jesus christ it's an achievement now i want to look at abraham's life for a few minutes if you look in romans chapter 4 here because when we speak of the believer's achievement it's not something we've done but it's the grace of god that has come to us to provide what is needed so that we might come to the place of achievement of what god desires to achieve through our lives now look at abraham's life here's abraham in romans 4 11. i want you just to look at it in this way how that the achievement of the living god was moving in abraham's life as he fully obeyed god god would reveal himself come down through many different ways he would speak to him there would be lights there would be dreams there would be visions and how god the very first time god would make himself known he would there in genesis 14 as far as in a manifestation would be there with melchizedek and he would reveal himself that he is the king and priest of the most high god and he would let abraham know that you are of and blessed of the most high god he would bring to abraham what was needed the bread and the wine then we find here you know a chapter or a few chapters later here god would make himself known to abraham as el shaddai the breasted one in other words you don't have what you need in order to bring this to pass you've got my word you've walked in my word you've done what i've asked but now what's needed you must draw your strength from me i am the life giver to the promise and he reveals himself as el shaddai take my life into your life i am the almighty god and then he comes and he manifests himself in the next chapter to abraham as elohim the self-existing god it's been the same god all along but now god stands before his tent door in flesh and now what is there with hindrances doubts and things in sarah's heart he came to deal with the doubts and the thoughts that were there sarah had him are you hearing me sarah had him abraham himself here he had experienced that that that divine change and how it's come into his life he's had a name change but he stands there and here comes the living god right down once again but he's come with a special visitation for sarah because sarah is god's intended womb hagar the woman the bondage hagar is a type of the law god never intended the promise to come by the law is that right because the law all it does it produces a wild man come on friends because they were debating and fussing and this and that now look david had an unction like others that could look into the law david could have delight in the law but david was under the anointing of christ that could look forward he could rejoice and he wasn't and he wasn't rejoicing in himself but this in this moment was god coming down to bring a release in sarah's life god could not do anything until sarah first believed are you hearing me god will not override unbelief listen to me now don't hang your heads but god himself makes it his personal business to deal with unbelief because unbelief is a spiritual power unbelief is a spirit come on friends a spirit that would want to hang around like brother ram said when he was younger he wanted to give his life to the lord but there was a spirit that hung over him that was preventing him from making that surrender unbelief is not a thought it's a devil and one spiritual power it has to be a greater spiritual power that's able to come on the scene and here you and i are and we're looking and beholding this contest as it opens up before us and god in the middle of that contest between faith and unbelief between faith and doubt god comes on the scene and he raises our faith in him because if our faith gets raised in him all things are possible to them that believe notice where abraham is at the bible says in verse 17 i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope come on now though a host shouldn't camp round about me let me tell you this host went far out it was right there are you with me now right here every day you're reminded of your mortality right here every day you pack this carnal thing around right here every day you've got to bring it in subjection to the word come on now with everything but that's why god he's given you the holy ghost and there's a son and daughter of god on the inside that when temptation arise there's a strength on the inside that says but god said but god has said oh my who against expectation believed in expectation that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be against expectation he believed why that he might become so he expected against everything else he wake up one morning oh my maybe his back is hurting worse than it was the you know last week but he believed god has made the promise and i am expecting it god made me the promise of the holy ghost i may not feel any closer but that promise it belongs to me it's an expectation that belongs to me and i'm gonna believe why that i might become what god has said concerning my life he spoke his word over me and he can't go back on his word he's not a man that he should lie the word of god is sure i wish i was twice as tall hallelujah i feel like running here about ready to do a jericho march hallelujah well brother i'm not just looking at this for myself brother joey i'm looking at this promise and for every need that's here right now this morning i see this promise for every child of god who against hope believed in hope that we might become the father we might become the word that he has spoken over our lives brother dave he spoke it over our lives there's only one way to go brother carlos and that's come up hither come up into him in all things there's only one place to go and let him take us there and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead remember he had fathered an ishmael god said i'll let you die buddy we'll be following no more children after this one i'm gonna let you get to a place where it's completely impossible well you're not just looking for is there another womb out there i'm gonna it's getting to a place of impossibility they weren't just they had been bearing their whole life are you with me and it tremendous god's choosing looks beyond what you and i can see if we were looking at this promise right here we would probably be looking at things that will be fertile and man i'll tell you this is almost a guarantee that's us come on friends we try to do things that say oh you know what yeah i think this is way yeah i think this makes sense well glory to god it just jesus thank you this just makes sense and god said i ain't in that a bit. see we do things so much by our reasoning and reasoning is not faith it's the greatest enemy against faith is that right now notice this his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb this was reminders all the time what god has said but here is deadness all around you oh my he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith somebody say that with me strong in faith let's say it again strong in faith read the next part with me giving glory to god oh my my back's hurting a little bit more oh i'm feeling a little bit weak what are you going to do abraham i think i'm going to turn up my praise drown out the doubt holding my shield of faith come on now i'm talking about walking and cutting that's why brother brown says you cut the devil you chopped the devil you hit him you everything you keep on coming at him because he's coming at you but the promise is sure because the god who spoke it is sure he was strong in the faith now remember if this is egypt over here abraham was not standing over here by chaldeas he was strong in the faith this scripture we're reading in romans 4 was not when he started there listen to me now there was a strength of faith that you could look at and say he's leaving his family business he was a god maker he's living he's living he's leaving the nativity i mean he ain't got nobody if they do have youngins he ain't got nobody to help babysit him when they want to have a date night or not then he leaves everybody what's he doing going leaving all the nativity what are you seeing faith to move out on the promise right it was a it was a strengthening of faith but you see his faith would only grow stronger as he believed and obeyed the word of god ask abraham abraham do you believe what i told you about separating coming out of the land of the nativity coming out from among your kindred absolutely god i believe it all the way i believe it look where i'm at and god said um you got your daddy with you still and i thought i told you to leave all your kindred yes lord now look look at god's grace abraham is rejoicing he's shouting he should be look what he's come out of he should be don't condemn him you and i were in the same place it took faith to come out that way is that right faith is acting upon god's word not knowing where you're going not knowing how it's going to come to pass but i am going to stand on god's word abraham is shouting and all of a sudden god says i see my boy needs a little bit of help his faith needs stirred a little bit because he's packing lot and his daddy brother graham called them hairs in the biscuit i hate hairs in my food maybe if i put more hair in my food or somebody did i'd lose weight i can't i'll tell you the lord knows i can't but anyhow you see when we look at this hero came a time and god said abraham needs help this is grace church i'm talking about grace now god said he needed help brother branham breaks in on he said what a hard thing it was for abraham to separate from his nephew because he loved him he didn't see did not separate because he didn't love him are you hearing me now he separated because he loved god more are you hearing me that's why he separated his love for god was more and god seen that abraham needed help so god allowed a disturbance to come up argument these things took place and finally oh abraham's eyes become old we can't hey we're not focused on the same thing we're not you go this way i'll go this way if you choose this way i'll choose this way what's he doing he's declaring there is a need for separation what is causing him brother greg to make that decision the promise that he's holding in his life it's like when you receive a child or one in the womb getting ready to come to birth or are you hearing me now when you have a child that's in the womb getting ready to come to birth you want to watch over that you don't want your wife out playing volleyball come on now you know i mean you you you you because you're looking at it hey we got to protect this life and i know god's given protection all around that but even you start looking and say honey i'll drive you i don't want you driving behind a steering wheel you you look for all the protections why are you doing that because i know that there's a child that's begotten that needs to come to birth are you hearing me now this is just exactly how it is with a life that has been begotten but it's not coming to a full born-again experience there's nutrients that have to be taken in i love my wife got some cravings because she liked some things that i liked probably wasn't too good for me but i liked them when paul was coming along well honey i won't tell all that because i don't embarrass you but it wasn't all her i just you man i was like good lord i'm glad these cravings are this way you know it wasn't pickles and ice cream and stuff like that and if it was for you that's all right but you know what them cravings are it's because the life on the inside the life is craving that on the inside and that's why when god is dealing with the life you say here you are you start out right here what do i do put distance between yourself and egypt how do i do that grow strong in the faith how do i do that eat the nutrients of the word of god they're spiritual vitamins that's needed and the church is in travail zion travaileth to bring forth life are you hearing me now see this is all it's growing strong in the faith you see faith itself faith is not something brother random put it down so simple got it right here in my notes but i'm just going to go ahead and preach it as it's coming faith he said is not something he said sometimes people try to go message token they try to do some supernatural faith in order to get healing and he said that's why you miss it he said you apply the blood with common faith say what's common faith is anybody in here worried about whether your car is going to start out there nobody's thought about i wonder if i'm maybe not better talking to everybody but you're not you're you're planning on when i leave out of here you know you're not even thinking about oh i wonder if the piston is going to kick over here i wonder if the oil i don't know how it all works i wonder if it's going to happen oh i wonder if that's going to happen i wonder if that's going to happen oh i wonder if that's going to happen i wonder if this gas is real or if it's water are you you're not thinking about that you're not thinking about you know you know even you know another thing i hope you're not thinking about where you're gonna go eat at you know you're not you're not even considering that like oh man i wonder if i'm gonna be able to get back home i wonder if they got that street blocked oh i wonder if they've got the manhole cover on there oh i wonder if they you're not thinking about that why because it's faith it's subconscious are you hearing me now it's faith it's faith to get in your car turn the key and drive it's common faith but god comes down to stimulate common faith in him that's why god sends his gifts in the church that's why the holy ghost comes is to stimulate faith from just on earthbound things that you and i don't even think about about doing it's just done subconsciously but he comes to stimulate our faith in him for there are greater promises more precious than just getting in our car and going home he does that you see a grace provides it not us grace provides it but you've got to accept what grace provides are you hearing me caleb and them went over there and the ghosts piled the land you know what that was about god wasn't interested in saying hey you know what i don't know how that looks over there but why don't y'all go see what it looks like and you come back and tell me what you think that ain't why god sent them in the land god sent them into the land to see what belonged to him when they shouldn't they should have been looking at the promises and better they should have been getting excited and saying praise god just any day now my feet are going to step right here i don't know exactly where my allotment is but all the land is good it don't matter what he's called me to do but as long as i'm in jesus christ it doesn't matter a bit but instead they got over there looking at giants and what happened doubt came in fear came in everything came in and here was joshua and caleb they were coming back they had grapes grape juice great pudding what are y'all doing oh we just got we got grapes glory to god it's just exactly what was said a lamb the flow of the milk and honey you see one doubt had taken hold they looked and were focused on the giants that were there anytime you go to take a promise of god the devil makes sure because listen the devil ain't worrying about some barren land he wants to camp on promises are you hearing me now he wants to camp on those promises and when they came back down through there they came focused on the evidence of the land and what was it doing building faith in their life listen friends you can't get faith outside of the word of god the bible said faith come about hearing and hearing by the word of god if you ain't no further than you ought to be is because you're not giving yourself to god the way you should be are you hearing me oh brother samuel that stings a little bit it's all right say ouch oh me it'd always be good look like you pour the peroxide on there or in the curriculum it'll sting it first but it'll do good it'll drive out the infection and get healing ready to start you have got to take the word faith is i believe it and i'm going to act upon it but if you don't act on it you can't expect god to come in lord i've been waiting on you to do it been waiting on me to do it i'm the fire that comes on the altar but you got to make the altar you got to get the sacrifice you got to lay it in order oh lord i'm waiting on i'm waiting on you to come god said what have you been doing that's with everything every promise of god but he was fully persuaded that he was able to perform what he said but says when you say you believe anything then you've got to put it in action abraham was commanded to separate from all and believe and walk with god alone and instead of getting weaker he got stronger when he was a hundred years now his physical body didn't get stronger are you hearing me now oh my we just got to preach on it his feelings did not get stronger are you hearing me his feelings did not get stronger maybe abraham did not have the strength to do a praise break for an hour around the tent maybe the only thing abraham could do he got to a spot he could pat his foot and say glory to god he's still the same god that didn't mean he was weaker his body was weak but inside he was being built up with the things of god there was a building up that was taking place because faith is not feelings and feelings is not faith glory to god oh my don't you love him oh glory be to god that's why brother brown could say that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon that god is able to keep every word that he said that he would do when we're zeroed in notice when we're zeroed in with the word of god because the bible says without faith it is impossible to please god it's impossible so faith itself how god will come on the scene through his word and we've already looked at this of how that even paul we were speaking about this with moses i think early in the service of even how that when paul would come paul would be able to testify just like moses when he would speak there the word he was speaking a word that god had given to him personally it was inspiration that was going out upon the lives of the people and that's why paul could say that our word our word was not yea and nay but as god is true our word toward you is yea and amen is that right for all the promises in him are yea and amen now to think of it god coming to stimulate our faith stir our faith in the promise of god that's his grace that's given to us and to think of the hour that you and i are living in brother branham would make this statement like this and i want to just i want to come down i want to just coast on a couple of these parts here we dealt with that of faith faith is a common thing every person has faith god comes down to stimulate that faith and that stimulated faith to believe in god then when the holy ghost comes it's no longer our faith alone it's the faith of god inside of us moving our faith so to think of where that we are standing here in this hour in this ephesians brother branham would take from the even the examples he says in order how many times you hear brother branham utter this out he says if we can't have enough faith for him how are we going to have enough faith for a rapture well let me preach right now because i feel it coming let me preach when we're talking about divine healing we're not talking about you're prayed for right here and right away you're well divine healing is there's a promise of god that's been given you've been prayed for and you take god at his word you stand on that word you might feel worse the next day feel worse the next week but you're standing on god's word the second miracle of canaan when the man asked jesus to come and jesus said i can't go he said he said but i'll speak the word talking about the man from canaan that ain't the roman nobleman he spoke the word and notice as he's on his way back home here comes one of the servants running and saying hey hey the servant is healed and what did he ask him he asked him the question what hour did he begin to amend what hour did he begin to amend you see the work how healing moves in our bodies and a lot of times when it doesn't take place right away we'll say god didn't hear prayer no we are abraham's seed and abraham's seed stands on the promise i don't care if it's worse the next day it's works next month who against hope believe in hope that he might become an expression that i'm the lord that god that healeth on that diseases that he might become that i am the lord who bore stripes for your healing that's what brother brahman says you can wiggle a little bit like this you do it come on now some of those are you wanting the holy ghost don't don't check out on me this applies to everything you wiggle a little bit keep moving from egypt keep getting closer keep moving closer to the promise you wiggle the finger then you're wiggling two fingers then you keep on wiggling what's happening there's healing taking place and eventually you start moving the hand then comes the arm then it begins to move through the rest of your body divine healing oh my my my my glory be to god can't you see how the rapture is tied in all through the scriptures it's a promise of god god who become the good work in your soul will finish it that miracle makes way for the next miracle hallelujah brother samuel i don't really feel wiggle that finger what am i whatever your brother said you don't understand no i do understand cast down that doubt cast down all imagination you cast down every thought of every unclean devil of unbelief that tells you that the promise is not for you wiggle that little finger right in his face shake your hand in his face go ahead and kick your leg right in his face these are our promises [Applause] what are you doing i'm putting some distance between me and egypt it's kind of like going on a vacation you're so excited oh glory to god we get to go on a vacation and you stop at the mcdonald's on amherst maybe a chick-fil-a i could go along with you but you stopping to make down why you ain't putting no distance between you at all glory to god we're on vacation really well while you're here this is this is native ground you'd think go ahead at least stop on down in mansfield close your eyes but you know go ahead and stop on down there do whatever you know i mean you know i'm saying put some distance between you and say how do i put distance believe him who's speaking to you i'm telling you you've got to fight for every promise but every promise is worth it hallelujah glory be to god oh hallelujah notice this this royal seed that's coming on royal seed brother iran could stand in this day the scriptures fulfilled and say in this day there's to come a super royal seed of abraham a royal bride to the royal promised son it's a spiritual seed there's a spiritual bride rising up it will be the royal seed of the royal faith of abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and place is a promise that's given to her and god has sent his message to bring us and open that place that promise to you and i to who to the royal seed of abraham the royal seed of abraham is not the seed that can say look i can prove to you my genealogy my that no but the royal seed is those that can hear him there's something on the inside to hear the call there's liberty there's freedom there's deliverance not something on the outside that says well i was born in the message i was raised in a message i know the message to be true but there's a call that goes to the inside that said he who the son makes free is free indeed it's a call of liberty and that seed on the inside heals it jesus said if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me there's no greater drawing power than the holy ghost gospel if i be lifted up i'll draw all men he's still drawing it's having effect jesus said no man can come to me except my father which sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day there's something drawing you beyond your doubts beyond your unbelief i'm telling you it's a work of a supernatural god that's coming to a royal seed of abraham this is not your doing it's god working in our lives manifesting himself to where we finally call out yes lord i see it's your desire for me and all i have to do is surrender this is the ephesians of this day i'm coasting i'm coming i'm on that runway i'm don't unbuckle yet we might have to but we're going to put the tray tables out this is our ephesians to where god has come down in this hour brother bran would say it in this place trying to do god a service he said that elijah of this day is the lord jesus christ he said it's not the man but it's god coming through that office of a prophet see others can look think about how the scriptures is when they brought the greeks to jesus they wanted to see jesus they came and they saw nothing but a man but faith sees beyond faith sees beyond you see the royal seed of abraham brother braham tells us when those three were coming walking down the road in genesis 18 here god is a company there were two angels he said as he came down he said abraham was stayed in a spiritual atmosphere all the time around his tent he said abraham was prayed up there was he was in an atmosphere and he says when abraham saw that man he said it was something on the inside of him that rang out there's something spiritual about this man what is it time to perk up and pay attention and that ministry of the son of man in this hour it was made manifest so that the pride would come out and be united with jesus christ brother random just happened to be the vessel a son of man revealing the son of man we're not united to a son of man we're united to the son of man jesus christ the word god provided a word we could be washed washed in order to come into service and uniting we're no longer twain abraham why are you making the decisions you make him because it's a promise i'm holding abraham it don't seem like you're as careless about your decisions you're making anymore because i got further away from chaldea i'm closer i'm nearer to to the promise than i've ever been you see the closer you get to god and you live it'll affect your decisions it'll affect your decisions because listen over the same i'm predestinated god don't pull you through a pipe and let's just get real every decision you make is not thus saith the lord because we've made some decisions we've had to say ouch old me forgive me jesus come on church that's never you can't pull that in the scripture anywhere that those who were of the election of god as though that oh they don't have choices no more god just picks them up like puppets and drags them around that's not it at all what it is is when they have met god the prophet tells us in the message breach when you've been redeemed you no longer want your own choice because christ has been your choice and so everything he's the filter of your life he's your thinking man's filter that every decision that comes along things that you allow in your home things that you allow for your children places you go you filter it through a thinking man's filter and if you can't make it through a thinking man's filter you say sorry can't do it it's been filtered by the word that's why the word it can't be just filtered by a letter it's got to be an active filter it's got to be an active filter that active filter within our life the only thing that can come down in there is pure holy ghost pure god so decisions and things in our life it'll affect decisions that we make in our life i think that this is why in a time we're warned by the scripture as every believer has been down through time watch and pray because why you don't watch with these eyes it's spiritual eyes that are open and prayer is the radar of the believer it catches things that are coming up that are not even seen yet are you hearing me now i'm not just talking about the rapture i'm talking about the holy ghost i'm talking about healing i'm talking about deliverance i'm talking about every promise in your life where you begin to pray for things that is right before you what's happening there's a radar that's going out that i know the promise is mine i'm praying for it brother graham said you want to know the direction the church is headed you listen to how they're praying because how they're praying will tell you the direction they're headed oh well what's coming up oh i i see i i see god factories i see abraham you shouldn't be seeing god factories did you do did you make a u-turn abraham well you're right god brought me out of that i shouldn't be back there looking at that hello i shouldn't be back in those same things come on friends things that were traps before in your own life hear me now things that were trapped in your own life you have to reign over that because just to tell you your children didn't come from somebody else hello i'm getting right down on the road now the same traps and that's why you have to be very mindful i don't want to go back here does every one of our children have to have a fresh experience they all have to have a fresh experience but they don't have to start in the house of the god maker come on church we're in this trip we ought to be distanced between us and them our homes our children we're going to be getting closer to god not further from god closer to god we're nearer than we've ever been before are you hearing me when i take off for a flight i don't want to go back i don't want when i circle around and if i see him and now she starts seeing tower you know terminal tower whatever that tower is down here in in cleveland and you start seeing the fields and the brownsfield and the indians or whatever they're called now you start seeing all that stuff i don't want to see that i'm leaving there to go on a destination i did not get in an airplane to tour cleveland we could shout on that one a little bit i didn't get in there to tour cleveland i got in there because there's a destination there's somewhere i'm going i'm not here to circle around this mountain i'm not here just to circle around this message i'm here to go all the way there's an ephesians right here upon us and god's grace brother branham plays it just like this tray table's up and as the tray table's up let that washing of water by the word come on down there and collect all the trash coming on down collecting all the trash anything you want to deposit from your trip aren't you glad you don't have to leave out you don't walk out of the plane with trash do you you don't walk out water bottles and you know the the pretzel wrapper that contain two pretzels in it you don't walk out of there and with fans say oh yeah i got to keep my trash right now when it's time for landing let's let you know put it up there's somebody coming down the hill to collect trash i'm telling you right now the almighty god is walking down the aisles he's moving down through every heart and every life he said you've got any faith that you don't want to carry no more put it in here put it in here put it in the blood because it's time departure it's almost time here's abraham coming to the gate taxing when we look up we see a mountain and it's a mountain that god spoke to abraham about i've heard of thee by the hearing of my ears but now i see thee his faith is becoming sight god has asked him take that only son notice god never said one of your boys god said that one that's your doing that ain't mine but you take your only son and you go offer him up what's god looking for will you fully obey me let's say i thought god i thought abraham had fully obeyed him you ever notice how brother brahma will bring this in the message abraham walks out of chaldea and he says when abraham fully obeyed him god said here's the land that i was talking to you about then you don't see god show up then here comes the separation of life brother braham says when abraham fully obeyed him then here god shows up. how is how is he saying when he fully obeyed walk in the light as he's in the light step by step i won't even try to jump i know better than that you don't jump in god you walk because you know what every step it's positioned it's planted it's faith in the word of god wonder what believing is believing is faith in action well brother samuel i don't feel nothing yet come on mary was a type of the royal seed right mary didn't feel nothing brother brown said she was positive before she was positive how could she be positive before she's positive because she'd have a positive experience by a positive god who gave a positive promise so she was positive do you feel anything no but god's already said it he said i was the one that isaiah spoke of it's so real in my heart oh i had questions sure i had questions how can it be me me and even the devil told her brother braham goes and spoken words are regional see the devil he said came over to mary and said you you think you think you're the one you ain't nothing but an 18 year old girl but she said you know what this is my brother and brother brown breaking into a conversation she said but my mama and she sold that seed in me when i was just a little girl and god has come and vindicated that seed to me i've heard about the message i've heard about god i've known that it's for me i know that the promise is for me but now i see god speaking personally to my life glory be to god in the highest i tell you here's abraham standing there abraham takes isaac up there now you notice this it wasn't enough just for him to come to that mountain and say and god said oh that's all you got to do abraham you i see already you you fully obey me that ain't what god said do on now god just didn't say come come to a church oh i i believe that god didn't just say just when you say i believe the message no no but you to go up there and take thine only son that which you love the most and it'd be a sacrifice i've shown what i spoke to you now here's the way abraham could walk up there isaac asking him a question you talking about god was in the camp let me remind you what isaac's age was 17 years old and isaac said daddy now listen brother brown went through things with his children he told us in the message indictment because you've got to suffer with them through those ages is that right a lot of counsel was given all the way through these but look look the presence of god and isaac could say daddy hey i i see all this wood we got but where's the sacrifice you see that's a question of because isaac can't see it but abraham's faith says my son god will provide himself a sacrifice abraham what are you doing i'm doing exactly what he told me to do because if i do all that he has said do he'll come he'll come if i do all that he said do the holy ghost comes the bible said he gives the holy ghost to them that obey him you might have things in your room at home you might have things in your car you might have things there that you can say oh i got to go clear them out if you fully obey from your heart right now and the holy ghost comes brother you don't have to worry about your car you don't have to worry about your music you don't got to worry about what's on the phone you don't got to worry about what's back at home in the room or in the apartment you've dealt with what needs to be dealt with and it'll show itself anybody hear what i'm saying abraham so abraham here he is listen you talk about the effect in a home you're talking about the effect in a home of just being under obedience of the word of god you talk about the stability of being on oh brother samuel if something no no no you and me both being under the stability of the word look look what it did by abraham walking in obedience it invited the presence of god an atmosphere my brother ram tells us in the token you create that atmosphere with the love and consideration for your loved ones and atmosphere that they will fall into it because it's the creative power of almighty god and here was abraham daddy where's that sacrifice i can borrow you just having me tie his hands with him in front back i don't know it was abraham what he loved the most he was asked to surrender into the hands of god completely what he loved the most can you see calvary can you see calvary can you see your own personal calvary and here the atmosphere the anointing that's upon it it wasn't the lamb it wasn't him kicking and screaming and pulling you you and i can't even think of anything man my son or my daughter they'd be screaming they'd be crying they'd be this they'd be there it was listen it wasn't genetics it wasn't human genetics it was the presence of god that came because of obedience to the word of god the token comes when there's full obedience that's why in everything we do apply the token and he brought isaac and i laid isaac down on that altar can you read a minute lay down right here would you we're doing this up good brother brahm tells us that they had went up there that started out remember it was a journey to get there he said abraham set the alarm clock to get up early before sarah ever stirred he wasn't going to tell sarah about it because sarah would have said you're not going to do that you say who is sarah brother branham identified that sarah in our life as job's wife that spoke like a foolish woman and i've heard by now i see he identifies it he said deny what that foolish woman is saying and believe what god is calling you to do see how the type applies it follows into that and brother bam says here abraham came into this place takes his knife but you know what he already abraham had already testified to those men that were at the bottom of the hill he said i am the lad we're going to go up there and worship and we'll be back we're coming back down how's that gonna happen i don't know but god gave the promise and god can't fail he said he would bless me through that seed i don't know how he's gonna do it but i know one thing i'm gonna be walking back off there because that isaac is not man's doing you didn't put that in your life you didn't put that desire there god put that desire there sunday school didn't put it there mama didn't put it there daddy didn't put it there god put that desire on the inside and that buzzer is going off brother bram called it a buzzer what's going off oh no what's sarah going to say about this or she finds out what's going to happen now that buzzer brother i'm saying satan coming up and trying to tempt him and here abraham is saying i love you and abraham has his knife right here and then abraham says he takes at night and when he gets here that's full obedience full obedience even though he was on the altar had his knife out that wasn't full obedience brother braham says when his hand was in the air and the angel of the lord came and caught his hand stay thy hand abraham for now i know that thou lovest me more than thine only son what do we see from here do all that he says for you to do but i thought i'm the surrender that is you surrendering surrendering is not just setting down on the pew and just friends i'm sorry i can only give examples as he gives them to me that ain't surrendering surrendering is what he's told us to do it don't line up with my thinking he don't line up with my ideas but my surrendering is what he said i'm going to do it i don't have to make sense to me that didn't make sense to abraham it didn't make sense to him but he surrendered his own ideas and what happened he walked off the mountain about that time man there was no ram up there before abraham had built an altar there wasn't no ram there before but because he walked in obedience here came the miracle here came the paradox on the scene because he walked in obedience to god you want to see the paradox of the holy ghost you walk in obedience to the word of god you want to see a paradox of healing a paradox of deliverance you walk in obedience to the word of god come on son and god will perform his word just like he said he would so surrendering is i don't understand it but this is what god said do and he's big enough i don't have to make sense to me i just have to trust him there's things that god will ask us and he does continually ask us and things that ask him to trust him and you know what finally there's times that we can get in our life and god says you're tired enough yet well lord i've just been trying to make the promise come to pass god said are you tired yet well lord i'm just trying are you tired yet well i'm just trying god said that's a problem you're trying you can't save your children you can't save your husband you can't save your wife can't save your grandma your grandpa but what you can do is there can be such an atmosphere of the token life created around where your life is so surrendered and there's a generating power of the holy ghost that if you will walk in in faith and honor to god's word it will invite god to come on the scene oh my i tell you the gathering is unto him what a place that we're in here this morning what an opportunity what a place to move on the promises of god what a time to move what a time to receive the holy ghost god has made himself so real even in this service things that god not only has done in this service but healings right here in the assembly that you know is beyond what man can do why does god do that that's his grace brother braham says it's god's grace to bring us conscious of a living god who's present to make good on every promise to do what stimulate our faith anybody ever needed a jump start on your car well how do you get a jump start do you go to somebody else who's got a dead battery huh you don't go to a secondhand shop where they sell these you know this was a battery my uncle you know you don't want that you want to go to where there is a battery and somebody's got to start their car right their engines got to be going and then when that engine's going then you can put them jumper cables on there and you know what them jumper cables will do you put them on there and you get them on the right terminals on that battery inside of you there will be an energy that will travel from that car right into the other there is quickening power right here this morning there is quickening power right here this morning the power of god right here to bring from death unto life the power of god to change lives forever for eternally he's here the same quickening power the same god who stopped abraham's hand what do i do go on up to the mountain but i've got the knife out bring it back and say lord i'm withholding nothing withholding nothing i surrender all to you everything i give to you withholding nothing withholding nothing help me sing it i surrender all to you everything i give to you withholding nothing withholding nothing lord i surrender all to you everything i give to you withholding nothing withholding nothing you see this is where we move and we act upon the word of god this is a time in a service where even you move and you act upon the word of god this is a time that you take in of that word as you've been taking and this is the time to act on it it's a time to move on it's a time to surrender it's a time oh brother samuel i just you know i'll just write here out no it's a time to move on it by the quickening power is here while the spirit of god is flowing while it's moving it's time this is a time to move on the word of god remember abraham would have never heard that ram if he'd just stayed back in the camp but look what happened one of the greatest testimonies and witnesses you know what god did god made double sure the promise god not only had gave promise in the beginning but when god said thy seed shall possess the gates of thine enemies god made a double sure an oath of confirmation it was it there's nothing can rise against it you see what god was showing in the evening time god would make a confirmation of his word that he's given that i'm the lord come down my promises are sure hallelujah i'll tell you right now this morning it'd be a good time to move in the promises of god it'd be a good time if you need healing in your body it'd be a good time to move on right now you need deliverance it'd be a good time to move on right now you need the holy ghost it'd be a good time to move on it right now brother samuel i'm ashamed don't be ashamed don't be ashamed of him if because it ain't man or somebody else dealing with you it's god dealing with you but that same quickening power is right here this morning hallelujah heavenly father lord jesus you've given lord and you've spoke your word father we stand here lord this morning aware that god we are in the presence of almighty god lord as we are standing here lord if we can say it in this way on holy ground not because this ground is any greater ground than any other ground but it's because of holy god lord you've come you're right here among us what an opportunity lord right here for lives and hearts that are gathered you knew who would be here this morning you knew who would be here lord father you know the needs that are gathered here lord and i pray father that lord as we lord would pray for lives and hearts as lord we take these promises that are given to us we ask o god that lord you would come lord in confirmation of your word may there be arms arms that will go up lord like abraham's arm with a knife in full obedience and ready to come down and thrust through and at that time the angel the lord moves down lord lord i'm reminded that a man's strength is regarded as his arm lord it's your strength moving down when we surrender our strength to you lord i'm asking right now that god may there be feet put on that faith feet would be put on that faith to walk lord down to receive that promise lord god if they need to repent lord oh god be baptized in the name of jesus christ the need to receive the holy ghost may they put feet on that faith [Music] granted lord god this morning i pray lord god healing in their body may they put feet on that faith lord god deliverance may they put feet on that deliverance [Music] i'll remind you as the prophet said he spoke of inspiration coming down and he said when god is here to inspire you you speak it and he will make your body obey your confession [Music] glory it's his inspiration it's him inspiring this morning in his promises we're in another ephesians maybe you need to have your own ephesians this morning maybe you've come out of egypt but you've not went fully into the promise of god but right here's this morning right here's a just a a good time because he's here not because i said it but because he's here i can't take you anywhere i can point you to him i can yield my body and he can come down and he would speak what he desires to speak and speak to your heart but the same one that speaks to you is the very one that'll take you fully in because he is our joshua it's grace provided for us in this hour i wonder this morning [Music] would there be lives and hearts say remember me in prayer god bless you god bless your hands i know there's vastness of needs throughout this building there's needs physical needs spiritual behind those hands god knows what's behind them we want to invite him to come i wonder if there's one that would want to come and stand down here and say lord i want to be fully identified with you i want lord god my life i want to make a full surrender lord i want to take back lord lift up that hand completely lord that the angel of the lord comes down hallelujah glory be to god oh my heavenly father you're the one who brings courage lord for us to stand on the promises the lord i speak dear god against every unclean spirit of doubt [Music] satan i'm here to remind you you're defeated you've already been stripped of your power [Music] at calvary and i'm here to remind you you're defeated i stand as a witness of that resurrection power now you must hold your peace and leave [Music] lord god i pray for every one of these needs behind these hands that have went up father you're the same quickening power the same god right here among us that when lord that man died in the battle they threw him in the grave on elisha's bones and that quickening power was still there lord it was the same quickening power that packed elijah the same one that gave him strength lord god to run ahead of that chariot lord god it's the same strength right here among us lord the same quickening power lord god for the physical and the spiritual needs right here among us this morning i pray dear god for these needs lord god father we're looking to you because you're greater than every giant you're greater than every devil of unbelief lord god and father we lord jesus look to you this morning that you will move lord for the every knee that was behind the uplifted hands of your children lord o god whether it's a physical need in their body lord that father they're standing there in hope against hope lord their god believing your word and acting upon it confessing it lord even though lord god that in their body lord they might feel worse than what they felt a week ago but that don't change the promise of god lord their handing lord and standing upon that word lord god i pray father that just like abraham lord as they stand upon that word right there putting feet to that promise lord it invites it invites you to come and do what only you can do granted lord for those spiritual needs lord in hearts and lives right here this morning granted lord may you open eyes eyes the lord have looked but like gehazer they don't see but i'm asking lord i'm asking you open their eyes this morning lord god that they will see you lord jesus they might say and know that it's you that lord god surrender their lives over to you all ambitions all dreams to put them in your hands and coming under your lead father i pray lord jesus may you take this service lord on into consecration i pray we committed to you lord god for every single need right here this morning lord god you've spoke to us put feet faith has feet on it put distance between you and egypt put distance the separating we feed lord feed upon the spiritual vitamins and nutrients of the world getting stronger and stronger lord i pray god throughout this congregation may lord god they realize lord jesus i believe they do but sometimes lord we forget and we need to be reminded that god of the resource that we have before us we can just feed as your prophet would tell us and who is this melchizedek feed fully on the word in order to receive strength to fly above the things of the world oh god granted lord may they feed upon the word of god may they start lord sometimes lord the things small things we look at the small things and think well that's just a small thing reading my bible that's a small thing praying and just talking to god about the problems about things that i'm looking at in front of me and things that i'm seeing those are small things but remember it takes small things to smart start a big fire [Music] small things you don't start a big fire with big logs you start a fire fire gathering twigs you begin to read the promises of god begin to take them in begin to pray over the promises of god begin to give yourself to the word of god what are you doing you're building strength for the promise granted lord i pray lord i'm gonna go ahead [Music] and thank you for meeting and every and fulfilling every single promise anybody want to join in with me right now hallelujah lord jesus as a congregation lord we're going to go ahead and say thank you we're calling those things that are not as though they are we're calling them lord god because you have spoken who can but prophesy we're calling them lord so glory be to god in the highest that is our confession lord god lord glory be to god oh we're not worked up we are moved by divine inspiration don't call me worked up this world is worked up there's doubt all around but i'm not looking at that i'm looking unto him where everything is possible to them to believe no matter what the circle says i'm not worked up i know exactly where i am i know in whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed against that day glory be to god hallelujah i'm worshiping while i'm waiting i'm worshiping while i'm waiting i'm gonna go ahead and thank god while i'm waiting for they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an eagle wait on the lord i say wait on the lord and he shall strengthen thine heart lord repeat a god brother samuel what does that mean to be waiting it means to be settled and listening i'm just settled i don't know how i don't know when but i know i'm right right here looking to the one i need to be looking to i know that i'm right right where i need to be oh glory be to god my faith is not dormant but i have received shoes on my faith that faith will begin to walk toward the promises of god putting distance between me and the world unbelief doubt oh god granted lord i know lord jesus it's simple but you know i asked you even this morning early i said god help me tell me this so get out of the way lord would you bring it down to where it's so simple help us father i i believe you've done that lord but it ain't words that make it simple it's you lord it's you it's you that makes it simple but lord you know us in our humanity there's still things lord god how we need examples paul would look at a soldier and bring that inspiration and say put on the whole armor of god paul would look and see the athletes training in the olympics and he would say let us run this race he would look at that example and say a man is not crowned except he's tried lawfully he would go on to say i fight not as one that beat a fear he would take examples that the people lord would be able to relate to you inspired those examples to him lord oh god that's your love and mercy to us lord trying to get it across to us thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord i need it i need it lord i need it i need it to be that simple for me lord i needed that simple lord god simple lord simple but my faith has feed on it because faith without works is dead glory be to god hallelujah lord is the example you gave in the big beginning about that hurricane lord like god like brother carlos would prepare around his home when he lived in florida he would go buy that osb plywood whatever they could get their hands on him and others down there lord god we look at that osb and that plywood lord god you've given us direction in your word we surrender our own ideas i've often thought about it my goodness they're screwing that osb into their siding screwing it into these other things but you know what lord that just just how it is even spiritually there's things that you asked us to do it don't make sense to our natural mind it didn't make sense that they would come to the red sea but what didn't make sense to them and what brought scoffing from pharaoh was an opportunity as your prophet told us for you to flex your muscles and show your children your power because they were gonna need that example in their life oh god made for this congregation right here lord god may there be an accumulating of faith within their life experiences that they've had experiences they can reach back lord 15 20 30 40 years ago lord and recognizing the power of god over and over and over visitations of the holy spirit the word being opened up lord god it's an accumulating of faith in this hour young person it's the same way for you god touching your life dealing with your heart sensing the power of god how god's speaking to your heart discerning your heart his presence drawing near to you that's the power of god moving down upon your life to let you know it's not
