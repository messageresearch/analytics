[29:19] great things amen you know I just just
[29:22] listening to the prophet again here
[29:23] today and how that he was just speaking
[29:26] of sheep and brother Bram talked aled
[29:28] about he said you know when they brand
[29:29] those sheep he said every brand that the
[29:32] that the Sheep wear it matches the print
[29:36] that's in the hand of the
[29:37] shepherd so that what's on the sheep is
[29:40] in the hand of the shepherd Hallelujah
[29:42] he said you know you could take a
[29:43] shepherd and he said you can have cattle
[29:45] they can have goats and sheep and they
[29:47] said well you know brother Bram asked
[29:49] you said well how does that work and
[29:51] those men said well you know being a
[29:53] Shepherd they'll kind of be able to know
[29:55] how to work with the different ones but
[29:57] they said just stick around at nightfall
[29:58] and watch what happens and at nightfall
[30:01] the shepherd went out and when the
[30:03] shepherd begin to speak at nightfall the
[30:06] goats didn't respond cattle didn't
[30:08] respond but the Sheep
[30:10] responded because the Sheep are seeking
[30:13] for safety so there's one thing that
[30:16] that sorts out sheep and that's his
[30:18] voice Jesus said my sheep know my voice
[30:22] and I'm known of them aren't you glad to
[30:24] be able to hear his voice I tell you
[30:26] that's the greatest treasure there is to
[30:27] be ble to hear his voice and to have a
[30:29] heart that's tuned into it to say be it
[30:31] unto me Lord according to thy will that
[30:34] is a great great value in this hour Amen
[30:37] to be able to hear his voice amen we
[30:39] just thank God for his Mercy tonight so
[30:42] thankful for the opportunity he's given
[30:43] us to be able to gather together anden
[30:46] so thankful to have friends and visitors
[30:48] here with us and different ones but
[30:49] we're just we're looking forward to What
[30:51] the Lord Has for us every time we come
[30:54] together God has something special for
[30:56] us amen God does call a meeting just to
[30:59] call a meeting I know we sometimes we
[31:01] get used to Thursday Sunday but you know
[31:03] those are only prescribed times that we
[31:05] have but God is the one who calls the

[31:21] word of the Lord amen we just want him
[31:23] to obey the Lord and just a the liberty
[31:26] and for the Holy Spirit most importantly
[31:28] that he would have the right away here
[31:29] tonight I believe we've all come here
[31:31] with one purpose and it should be the
[31:33] purpose is I want to leave closer to God
[31:37] than when I came in sir and sometimes
[31:40] that closeness is just letting God help
[31:42] us to sort out whatever it is that's got
[31:44] between him and us we still feel the
[31:46] pull but you know how it is when you can
[31:48] get all those other things cleared out
[31:50] then that magnetism that channel becomes
[31:53] even stronger and God is present to
[31:56] guide us as we come to House of God May
[31:59] our lives and our hearts when we leave
[32:00] out of here tonight our hearts have been
[32:02] set on fire amen anything that's in
[32:04] between us we've been able to say

[40:04] n Genesis
[40:06] 32 and N if you have a
[40:11] amen the Bible says and Jacob said oh
[40:14] god of My Father Abraham and the god of
[40:16] my father Isaac the Lord which Sith unto
[40:20] me return unto thy country and to thy
[40:23] Kindred and I will deal with Thee I am
[40:27] not worthy of the least of all the
[40:31] mercies and of all the truth which thou
[40:34] has showed unto my servant for with with
[40:39] my staff I passed over this Jordan and
[40:42] now I am become two bands deliver me I
[40:46] pray thee from the hand of my brother
[40:49] from the hand of Esau
[40:53] for I fear Him lest he will come and
[40:58] smite me and the mother with my children
[41:03] let's drop down to verse
[41:08] 204 and Jacob was left
[41:10] alone and there Wrestled a man with him
[41:14] until the breaking of day breaking of
[41:17] the day and when he saw that he
[41:20] prevailed not against him he
[41:23] touched he touched the hollow of his
[41:25] thigh and the hollow of Jacob's th was
[41:28] out of joint as he wrestled with him and
[41:31] he said let me go for the day
[41:36] breakthe will not let thee go except
[41:39] thou bless me and he said unto him what
[41:42] is thy name and he said Jacob and he
[41:45] said my name shall thy name shall be
[41:49] called No More Jacob but Israel for as a
[41:53] prince has has thou power with God and
[41:57] with men and has
[42:00] prevailed
[42:01] hallelujah amen may the Lord bless
[42:03] reading of his word you can have your
[42:07] seats as you as you're sitting let's
[42:10] turn over I'm thinking about the
[42:11] scripture let's turn over to Mark
[42:13] chapter
[42:17] 5 St
[42:21] Mark believe that's what I want chapter
[42:24] five
[42:33] St Mark chapter 5 and verse um let's
[42:37] just read verse
[42:38] 24 Mark 5 and
[42:41] 24 and Jesus went with him and much
[42:44] people followed him and thronged him and
[42:47] a certain woman which had an issue of
[42:49] blood 12 years and had suffered many
[42:52] things of many Physicians and had spent
[42:55] all that she had and was nothing better
[42:57] but rather go worse when she heard of
[43:01] Jesus when she when she heard of Jesus
[43:04] came in the press and touched His
[43:06] Garment for she said if I may touch but
[43:09] his clothes I shall be whole amen may
[43:14] the Lord had a bless him to the reading
[43:15] of his word L amen you know by the grace
[43:19] of God
[43:21] tonight I want to um use for a subject
[43:25] uh the point of Conta
[43:28] the point of contact amen that's and I
[43:32] know as Believers I know I'm not the
[43:34] only one who feel like this but to me
[43:37] the most important thing in my life is
[43:39] to know that I have an audience with God
[43:43] to know that when I come to church God
[43:46] is here when I'm at home God is here
[43:49] when I'm in my car God is here in the
[43:52] most important times of my life when I
[43:54] really need to touch God he's available
[43:58] for me to touch him amen amen and you
[44:00] know church I believe that we are to
[44:02] have a mindset amen that uh uh God wants
[44:07] to be touched Hallelujah yes sir
[44:09] Hallelujah God wants to provide your
[44:12] needs God wants to heal your body God
[44:15] wants to deliver you God wants to
[44:17] restore your joy that's who he is amen
[44:21] but you know church if we would for a
[44:23] moment tonight just think about the the
[44:26] point of contact Hallelujah and you know
[44:29] if I can let's let's let's go over to 1
[44:31] Samuel uh Chapter 30 first 1 Samuel
[44:35] chapter 30 and you know this is the
[44:38] scene where David and his men you know
[44:41] they they came back from Battle and when
[44:44] they came back their children and their
[44:46] wives were gone you know their sons were
[44:49] gone their daughters were gone and their
[44:51] wives were gone and you know you think
[44:54] about this this this this scene right
[44:56] here you know what happened uh uh to
[45:00] David's men and and David wasn't a
[45:03] result of sin in their
[45:07] lives
[45:08] Hallelujah sometimes you'll go through
[45:10] things because God wants to show who he
[45:13] is and you know one thing about David
[45:16] amen David was a man who had already had
[45:20] contact with God so when situations
[45:23] arose he didn't just act wildly
[45:25] Hallelujah he didn't just say I'm going
[45:28] put this in my own hands but what he did
[45:31] see the thing about a point of contact
[45:33] it makes you to
[45:35] remember Hallelujah it helps you to
[45:38] remember Hallelujah when you're in a
[45:40] certain scene you know uh uh but two
[45:43] weeks ago by God's grace I was flying
[45:46] out of the airport in Carolina and as I
[45:49] as I do most of the time I'll you know
[45:52] when I'm gone I'll just park my car
[45:54] there and and and and so I won have to
[45:57] wait on nobody when I get back
[45:59] Hallelujah so when I'm there cuz after I
[46:01] preached and and I'm back home I don't
[46:03] want to get the phone call where you
[46:06] at that aggravates me where you at you
[46:10] knew what time my plane was Landing we
[46:13] already worked this out you shouldn't be
[46:14] on the highway you should be there
[46:16] waiting on me hallelujah amen but that's
[46:20] neither here or there but Hallelujah but
[46:23] that's just a little insight amen Church
[46:26] you know as I got there like I normally
[46:28] do I parked in a longterm parking and
[46:31] and I'm going down following the arrows
[46:33] where you say there's a opening and as
[46:35] I'm going down I see a bus a bus is
[46:38] coming and I know Hallelujah that this
[46:41] is their parking lot so I yielded
[46:44] Hallelujah I yielded to give the bus to
[46:46] ride away I want you to understand
[46:49] something tonight this church belongs to
[46:52] you and whether you realize it or not
[46:55] the devil has to get out of your way the
[46:58] devil has to yield the right away
[47:01] because this worship belongs to you the
[47:04] word of God belongs to you the
[47:06] atmosphere belongs to you and whatever
[47:09] attribute of Christ is in the building
[47:11] tonight belongs to you and Satan has to
[47:14] get out of the
[47:16] way but you got to know who you are
[47:19] Hallelujah you got to know what's taking
[47:22] place and you know church as as I and I
[47:25] and I saw that she didn't judge it right
[47:28] and as she be to turn I said this lady
[47:31] is going to hit my car now there was one
[47:34] thing I could do I could blow the
[47:36] act crazy and try to move out the way or
[47:38] I could brace myself for impact and you
[47:41] know what Hallelujah brother Samuel
[47:43] there are too many too many people in
[47:45] church getting out of the way when God
[47:48] is trying to make a contact he sees
[47:51] exactly where you are he knows exactly
[47:54] Hallelujah where to hit you but there's
[47:56] too many of us afraid of the contact but
[48:00] I want you tonight to brace yourself
[48:04] Hallelujah because there's something
[48:06] that God wants to do in this building
[48:08] with you now are you ready to be touched
[48:12] by God or is this just another Thursday
[48:15] night church it was a regular old day I
[48:19] had been to that parking lot Hallelujah
[48:21] time after time after time but this time
[48:24] something different was going to happen
[48:27] something was going to contact me in a
[48:29] way Hallelujah I wasn't ready for and
[48:32] church as she turned she hit my bumper
[48:35] and then then the rest of the the rest
[48:37] of the bus begin to scrape the side of
[48:39] my car and I'm like this woman didn't
[48:46] ah now if that was
[48:50] me 20 years
[48:52] ago or a little bit longer than that
[48:57] come on now I've been on the other side
[48:58] a long time now Hallelujah you know it's
[49:02] a blessing when you've been serving God
[49:04] longer than you been in the world Amen
[49:06] that's a blessing Hallelujah I got more
[49:09] on the other side now Hallelujah that
[49:11] other person is just a vague memory
[49:14] Hallelujah in church Hallelujah as as as
[49:18] as you know she hit my bus and and and I
[49:21] begin to think amen if this was me years
[49:24] and years ago before I made contact that
[49:27] situation would have been different
[49:28] Hallelujah maybe I would have jumped out
[49:30] of my car because there was a time I was
[49:32] in love with my
[49:34] car oh that's good that's a good that
[49:38] was a time when I dressed it up
[49:39] Hallelujah when I put those shiny spoks
[49:42] on it and those clean wheels har and
[49:44] that nice paint job and those humps in
[49:47] the top and those gold buttons going
[49:48] around with that booming music inside I
[49:51] was in love with something that couldn't
[49:53] love me back
[49:55] [Applause]
[49:56] [Music]
[49:59] oh my I wonder how many people are still
[50:02] in love with things that cannot love you
[50:04] back the world will never love you back
[50:08] the devil will never love you back
[50:11] social media will never love you
[50:15] back
[50:17] right
[50:18] Hallelujah there are things that you
[50:20] come in contact with that really has no
[50:25] benefit is just there for a space and
[50:29] time to deal with your memory and church
[50:34] if that was me back then back in those
[50:36] days when I was so in love with my ride
[50:39] Hallelujah I would have begin to act the
[50:41] fool cuz I would have said you know all
[50:44] the time I put into this all the money I
[50:47] spent and you just going to hit it
[50:50] Hallelujah she didn't deliberately hit
[50:52] it but because of the state I was in all
[50:56] right
[50:58] back then because of the state I was in
[51:00] I would have been looking to blame
[51:02] somebody Hallelujah for what was taking
[51:05] place in my life oh my and too often
[51:08] things are happening around the world
[51:11] things are happening inside the church
[51:13] and instead of us looking at ourselves
[51:16] we want to blame somebody else with all
[51:18] God is trying to do is make a
[51:21] contact Hallelujah remember I said David
[51:25] didn't do any wrong his men didn't do
[51:27] any wrong but God was F to show them
[51:34] something hallelujah oh my that's so
[51:37] good hallelu yes sir
[51:40] Lord Oh Praise the Lord and church as I
[51:44] as I
[51:45] look and I begin to let me get this
[51:48] right right
[51:51] quick well don't worry about it let's
[51:54] go church when I
[51:57] when I look and I begin to see the scene
[51:59] and and now uh uh uh my car has been hit
[52:04] and this is the first time I've ever
[52:06] been in an accident in that car and now
[52:09] uh my Bumper's messed up my my my
[52:11] Fender's messed up and I'm looking at
[52:13] this and then something came over me and
[52:15] said hey I wonder how she feels so you
[52:19] know what I did church I went over to
[52:21] her and I said hey and I could see she
[52:23] was a little nervous I didn't know how
[52:25] long she was on the job and I begin to
[52:27] ask her how long you been on the job and
[52:29] all these things and she said about a
[52:30] year Hallelujah you know sometimes
[52:33] people be on probation for about a year
[52:36] hallelujah or maybe 90 days or whatever
[52:38] it was but God hallelujah put in my
[52:41] spirit I want you to go make her feel
[52:43] better there you go yes sir even though
[52:46] she hit your car I want you to go make
[52:49] her feel better Hallelujah I think about
[52:52] this church how often somebody's done

[53:01] bad about you or did you wrong
[53:03] Hallelujah and you sh them the next time
[53:05] you see them Hallelujah church I know
[53:08] two prominent preachers who were fussing
[53:11] Hallelujah one was fussed against the
[53:13] other and the other didn't really want
[53:15] to fuss and now they had a chance to
[53:17] come to a meeting in this area and
[53:19] everybody knew that they were fussing
[53:21] Hallelujah one of one one one was openly
[53:25] destroying the other brother's character
[53:27] and influence all open and the other one
[53:29] he was just taking it and now they're
[53:32] getting to this wedding they had this
[53:34] wedding and everybody's looking cuz both
[53:36] of them are there and they said brother
[53:38] what are you going to do when you see
[53:39] him he said when I see him I'm going to
[53:42] embrace him because he's never
[53:45] experienced this kind of love before
[53:47] hallelujah
[53:51] hallelujah hallelujah church love can
[53:55] conquer demon power love can shake the
[53:59] enemy
[54:00] loose how do you operate in those times
[54:04] of

[57:35] God to talk to your
[57:39] situation God cannot resist those words

[57:44] you begin to say Amen because amen means
[57:48] so be it Hall so when I'm preaching and
[57:50] you agree you say Amen that means you're
[57:53] amen and the word is being preached and
[57:55] when you say Amen that means be it unto

[58:32] ready for the word to start some of you

[59:00] because I believe it doesn't just apply
[59:02] to brother brandham amen he said Hey

[59:06] about the reaction of the people and the
[59:08] faith of the people and he made this
[59:10] statement he said what if I was to say

[59:28] was up there sitting in that suit in
[59:31] this suit preaching to you H sir Church
[59:34] what was he really saying he was really
[59:36] saying it's God in Me preaching to you
[59:41] so it really is God up here in the suit
[59:45] talking to you and you're feeling
[59:48] stimulation for Revelation that ain't me
[59:50] doing that that's the quicking power
[59:52] that lies within your
[59:54] seed woo
[59:56] [Applause]
[59:59] W and if that seed ever comes in contact
[1:00:02] with something that can germatize it it
[1:00:04] will make it say
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:09] Amen oh my so church as my car got hit
[1:00:13] everybody all right my car got hit and
[1:00:15] then I begin to talk about her and all
[1:00:17] these things I begin to think amen at
[1:00:20] that point of contact there were all
[1:00:22] kind of spirits
[1:00:24] present amen
[1:00:26] there were all kind of there could have
[1:00:28] been spirits of anger Hallelujah cuz all
[1:00:31] kind of things were happening now her
[1:00:34] the her supervisor comes out and he he
[1:00:37] comes up to the to my car and all these
[1:00:39] things and he says what happened and I
[1:00:41] tell him and he said yeah that's exactly
[1:00:43] what she said but that wasn't what was
[1:00:44] on my mind after I talked to her I had a
[1:00:47] flight to catch
[1:00:49] right Hallelujah I had a flight to catch
[1:00:53] and I had about an hour and 15 minutes
[1:00:55] to get inside and get checked in and all
[1:00:57] these things and get back to the back
[1:01:00] Hallelujah and this man was taking his
[1:01:02] sweet
[1:01:06] time and there was a spirit saying he
[1:01:09] need to hurry up you got to get out of
[1:01:12] here you need to make him hurry
[1:01:18] up I don't get religious on me
[1:01:21] now you know how you talk when you
[1:01:23] trying to get to work and you make maybe
[1:01:26] a little bit late and that person gets
[1:01:28] in front of you who don't got a care in
[1:01:29] the world and there's something inside
[1:01:31] you saying I wish you get out the way
[1:01:34] and it starts with a
[1:01:37] horn get out what is that that's a
[1:01:41] spirit making contact with
[1:01:43] you
[1:01:45] oh oh my oh my you already late so
[1:01:51] what's going to happen if you just get
[1:01:53] there late
[1:01:56] you already late you can't make up the
[1:01:58] time Hallelujah so you might as well sit
[1:02:01] in the car and pray about the situation
[1:02:04] instead of getting all aggravated
[1:02:06] because you know what's going to happen
[1:02:07] after you horn that person and that
[1:02:09] person get out the way because there's a
[1:02:11] spirit on you and Satan wants to feed
[1:02:13] that Spirit he'll put somebody else in
[1:02:15] front of
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:20] you what's happening you've made contact
[1:02:24] with the wrong spirit
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:32] but one of you driving Hallelujah and
[1:02:34] this person gets in front of you and
[1:02:36] they're driving crazy or driving slow
[1:02:38] and you say help them
[1:02:42] Lord then a spirit of peace comes over
[1:02:44] you and no matter what happens you've
[1:02:47] made contact with something that'll keep
[1:02:49] you calm and you never know Hallelujah
[1:02:52] that spirit that may have wanted to rush
[1:02:53] you Hallelujah maybe five miles down the
[1:02:56] road before you got to your turn there
[1:02:58] was an
[1:02:59] accident but you made contact with the
[1:03:02] right spirit that kept you come so you
[1:03:04] wasn't in a hurry so what happened you
[1:03:06] missed your
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:12] accident you can't tell me God don't
[1:03:15] work like
[1:03:17] that sometimes he keeps you calm for
[1:03:20] your own
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:22] good because Satan has traps he has
[1:03:26] things he set up for us
[1:03:29] [Music]
[1:03:31] hallelujah but if you get under the
[1:03:33] wrong Spirit Hallelujah you'll make
[1:03:35] contact with the things that Satan has
[1:03:37] out there for you oh my and you know
[1:03:41] church as I as as as a the man he says
[1:03:44] he wrote down information this and that
[1:03:46] he says now I got to call the police I
[1:03:48] said call the
[1:03:49] police see in my state when something
[1:03:52] happens on private grounds there's no
[1:03:54] ticket giving out they just write it up
[1:03:56] and change contact and you be gone he
[1:03:58] says no I got to call the police now I'm
[1:04:01] like oh my
[1:04:03] God that spirit is still trying to get
[1:04:05] on
[1:04:06] me I didn't pass this test but he's
[1:04:09] still lingering church let me tell you
[1:04:11] something Satan is a
[1:04:14] buzzard and he's always lingering he's
[1:04:17] always circling yeah you came through
[1:04:20] that battle but he's still circling
[1:04:22] Hallelujah you apologize to that sister
[1:04:24] but he's still circling circling Hall
[1:04:26] you and that brother made it right but
[1:04:28] he's still circling why because he's a
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:34] buzzer Eagles don't Circle they
[1:04:37] attack Hallelujah see you only Circle
[1:04:41] when it's dead Hallelujah have to make
[1:04:43] sure it's dead but an ego wants
[1:04:45] something that's alive it has to be
[1:04:48] moving it has to be jiggling and doing
[1:04:51] something that way that Eagle attacks he
[1:04:53] attacks something that's alive
[1:04:56] Hallelujah but Satan is AB bosard so
[1:04:59] he's always circling what is he doing
[1:05:01] he's studying the
[1:05:03] situation that's good and the enemy
[1:05:05] knows if you truly haven't forgiven that
[1:05:08] person yet that's so good oh
[1:05:12] oh oh oh so he'll allow another
[1:05:16] situation to
[1:05:18] arise because you've made contact with
[1:05:23] unforgiveness oh it's too late now of
[1:05:25] blood
[1:05:27] loose and you thought this was going to
[1:05:29] be a regular night no God wants you to
[1:05:33] forgive Hallelujah you've come here time
[1:05:36] and time again with hatred in that in
[1:05:38] your heart for that person but now it's
[1:05:40] time to let that go it's time to let it
[1:05:43] go it's time to let it go it's time to
[1:05:47] let it go and once you let it go you
[1:05:51] will feel
[1:05:54] better Hallelujah that's the reason why
[1:05:56] people come to church and it's so hard
[1:05:59] for the spirit to move because there are
[1:06:01] other Spirits making
[1:06:04] contact even right now where I'm
[1:06:06] preaching there's a spirit trying to
[1:06:08] contact you either it's God or it's the
[1:06:13] [Applause]
[1:06:14] devil sir
[1:06:16] Hallelujah and I can tell by the grace
[1:06:18] of God who's contacting you by the way
[1:06:21] you respond to the word
[1:06:24] right yes sir
[1:06:27] here we
[1:06:28] go here we go
[1:06:33] y that certainly doesn't look like a
[1:06:36] person who's made contact with
[1:06:39] [Applause]
[1:06:40] God you say brother you trying to excite
[1:06:43] the people no think about it contact
[1:06:45] with God he who knows
[1:06:48] all he who holds the world in his hand
[1:06:53] he who's the auor of joy
[1:06:56] peace Hallelujah he Hallelujah who knows
[1:07:00] everything he who omnicient has all the
[1:07:03] power in his hand if you make contact
[1:07:06] with
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:10] that if you make contact with that kind
[1:07:13] of God how could you ever hold your
[1:07:19] peace he said if you don't worship me
[1:07:22] the rocks are Crow
[1:07:29] this is what the prophet of God says he
[1:07:31] says hey now we worshiped Hallelujah we
[1:07:33] had a good song service but what good is
[1:07:36] that if we don't make a contact with God
[1:07:39] we sung some good songs some songs that
[1:07:41] we love and you know and we worship and
[1:07:43] everything but what good is that if the
[1:07:45] Fire doesn't come down on our Altar and
[1:07:48] consume our
[1:07:52] sacrifice oh that
[1:07:56] [Applause]
[1:08:05] everybody all
[1:08:07] right so the man police officer comes he
[1:08:12] says hey what happened I told him he
[1:08:15] says okay I got to see what she said I
[1:08:17] said hey how long this going to take I
[1:08:20] got to catch a flight let me back up a
[1:08:22] little bit her supervisor when I asked
[1:08:24] him I said hey
[1:08:26] I got about an hour to get to my flight
[1:08:28] somebody going to give me another ticket
[1:08:29] he said oh no uhuh that ain't got
[1:08:31] nothing to do with
[1:08:34] us y'all can imagine what was going
[1:08:36] through my mind I'm in Charlotte Airport

[1:08:44] transportation I paid my money
[1:08:46] Hallelujah to the Charlotte Airport and
[1:08:49] now you're going to tell me that what
[1:08:51] I'm being hindered up by is not
[1:08:53] accountable
[1:08:58] oh my that that that that sounds like a
[1:09:02] person sitting in church who hasn't been
[1:09:04] filled with the holy spirit yet they
[1:09:06] never want to be accountable they never
[1:09:09] want to hold themselves accountable it's
[1:09:11] everybody else's fault it's the way
[1:09:14] brother Diggs preaches Brother Sam
[1:09:16] didn't say this right in counseling he
[1:09:18] took my wife side or he took my
[1:09:21] husband's side he took the children's it
[1:09:23] ain't nobody else fault
[1:09:28] hallelujah it's always somebody else's
[1:09:30] fault it ain't never my fault I ain't
[1:09:32] did nothing wrong I ain't the reason why
[1:09:35] we going through
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:41] this church if you haven't realized
[1:09:45] tonight God is trying to break the
[1:09:47] chains off of somebody's
[1:09:50] life God is trying to deliver you from a
[1:09:53] spirit that's made contact with you
[1:09:56] and we're not strangers to that taking
[1:09:58] place in this church Hallelujah we've
[1:10:01] seen demons cast out in this church
[1:10:04] we've seen smoking demons be cast out
[1:10:07] Hallelujah in this church we've seen
[1:10:09] alcohol demons cast out in this church

[1:33:34] cable
[1:33:35] church I'm about to close how many
[1:33:38] believe
[1:33:40] it church 1st Samuel chapter
[1:33:48] 30 everybody all
[1:33:52] right 1st Samuel 30 while we notice the
[1:33:56] story when David came back Hallelujah
[1:34:00] and the Bible says let's let's let's
[1:34:02] let's just start at verse five it says
[1:34:06] and David's two wives were taken cap did
[1:34:09] a h and the jite and Abigail the wife of
[1:34:13] nabal the camelite and David was greatly
[1:34:16] distressed look
[1:34:18] Church the first thing that tried to get
[1:34:20] on David he was very distressed
[1:34:25] in his moment his wife was gone his
[1:34:27] children were gone his sons and
[1:34:29] daughters were gone and his captains his
[1:34:32] soldiers their children were gone but
[1:34:34] church sometimes we got to remember we
[1:34:36] got to go back we have to reflect on
[1:34:39] what God has done but look church when
[1:34:41] we go back and read we go up a little
[1:34:42] bit the Bible says uh in in in verse two
[1:34:47] it says it had taken the women and C the
[1:34:49] women captive and were therein they slew
[1:34:52] not any either great or small but
[1:34:55] carried them away and went on their way
[1:34:58] see sometimes when situations happen we
[1:35:01] overreact and ain't nobody been
[1:35:08] hurt the Bible says the women were taken
[1:35:10] captive the children were gone and there
[1:35:12] was nobody
[1:35:15] hurt and the people hallelujah we follow
[1:35:18] this on down Hallelujah the Bible says
[1:35:20] that David was grieved why because the
[1:35:22] people thought of stoning
[1:35:26] him anger was there grief was there oh
[1:35:32] my church let's keep reading and David
[1:35:34] was greatly distressed for the people
[1:35:36] spake of stoning him because the soul of
[1:35:39] the people was very was was grieved oh
[1:35:42] my now there's a spir a spirit of
[1:35:44] grieving
[1:35:45] there they were angry they were
[1:35:47] distressed and they were
[1:35:50] grieved over what
[1:35:54] the Bible said nobody was harmed nobody
[1:35:56] was
[1:35:57] hurt wow but what begin to happen their
[1:36:01] imagination begin to forerun the
[1:36:03] situation that's right there you go
[1:36:06] their imagination begin to make
[1:36:08] contact with something that never took
[1:36:15] place and how often our imagination
[1:36:18] gives us a scenario of what could be
[1:36:20] that never took place
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:25] why not let your imagination create
[1:36:28] something that's good for
[1:36:30] you instead of creating something that's
[1:36:33] bad for
[1:36:34] you Hallelujah and immediately in those
[1:36:37] moments Hallelujah their imagination
[1:36:40] thought about Hallelujah distress and
[1:36:43] grief oh
[1:36:45] my they were angry they were distressed
[1:36:48] they were grieved and they wanted to
[1:36:50] Stone David why because they were
[1:36:52] thinking of her hurt and pain but it
[1:36:55] already said nobody was
[1:36:59] hurt how often do we create scenarios
[1:37:03] that are not real we make
[1:37:07] contact we make contact in the spirit
[1:37:10] world with something that doesn't belong
[1:37:13] to
[1:37:15] you we make contact with spirits of
[1:37:19] unbelief because our imagination is
[1:37:21] creating a scenario
[1:37:29] right do me a favor brother turn that
[1:37:31] air down it's kind breathing on
[1:37:35] me
[1:37:37] look let's keep
[1:37:40] reading I'm g go over this again he says
[1:37:42] and David was very distressed for the
[1:37:45] people spake of stoning him because the
[1:37:47] soul of the people was grieved every man
[1:37:51] for his son and for his daughter
[1:37:54] but look in the midst of all that going
[1:37:58] on David begin to remember Hall and the
[1:38:03] Bible says and David encouraged
[1:38:09] himself so good he begin to overcome the
[1:38:13] grief he begin to overcome the anger and
[1:38:16] the distress and all the atmosphere that
[1:38:19] the people were creating by remembering
[1:38:22] the hand of the Lord
[1:38:24] and the Bible says David begin to
[1:38:26] encourage himself how did he encourage
[1:38:28] himself I guarantee you he begin to go
[1:38:31] back to
[1:38:34] Goliath yes sir some of you need to go
[1:38:37] back to your
[1:38:39] Goliath and what God did to your
[1:38:42] Goliath when it looked like the
[1:38:44] situation was impossible God put your
[1:38:47] giant in your
[1:38:50] hand God put that problem in your hand
[1:38:53] you spoke to it and you destroyed
[1:38:57] it I guarantee you David went back to
[1:39:01] the bear when the bear took the Sheep
[1:39:03] Hallelujah and David encouraged himself
[1:39:06] I guarantee you David went back to the
[1:39:09] lion and the sheep and David encouraged
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:15] himself I guarantee you David went back
[1:39:18] to when the Ark of the Covenant was
[1:39:20] coming back into the camp
[1:39:25] Hallelujah and he encouraged
[1:39:28] [Applause]

[1:40:55] back Hallelujah he's probably started
[1:40:57] thinking about the Mighty Men God gave
[1:41:01] him W he probably begin to think about
[1:41:04] the people he was worshiping with
[1:41:06] Hallelujah he started to think about the
[1:41:09] people he was worshiping with amen he
[1:41:11] probably was thinking about the people
[1:41:13] he was worshiping with cuz one day David
[1:41:15] went out to fight Hallelujah Goliath the
[1:41:18] children of anak and one of Goliath
[1:41:20] Brothers had a new sword and he said
[1:41:22] I'mma kill David and the Bible says a
[1:41:24] Bishi came up behind him
[1:41:28] and and he said don't you ever come out
[1:41:30] here by yourself
[1:41:33] again David begin to encourage
[1:41:37] himself David begin to think about
[1:41:40] there's somebody in here that got my
[1:41:44] back somebody got my back tonight
[1:41:47] somebody's fighting with me tonight
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:54] thank you
[1:41:56] Lord next
[1:41:59] verse in the midst of all
[1:42:01] that next
[1:42:04] verse and David in quiet of the
[1:42:11] Lord that was his point of contact
[1:42:14] that's good that's so good it wasn't the
[1:42:17] distress no it wasn't the anger it
[1:42:21] wasn't the grief the Bible say David
[1:42:24] encouraged himself and then he inquired
[1:42:27] of God saying see he had such in a
[1:42:31] relationship with God David was like
[1:42:33] Lord what do I do do I pursue or not
[1:42:37] right knowing that whatever God says is
[1:42:40] going to
[1:42:42] happen that's the kind of people we
[1:42:44] should be let's inquire of God before we
[1:42:47] do
[1:42:48] things let's inquire of God before we
[1:42:51] believe Satan's
[1:42:58] lies and David inquired and the Lord
[1:43:01] saying shall I pursue after this troop
[1:43:06] shall I overtake them
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:11] right see David wasn't going out there
[1:43:14] to play
[1:43:15] around sir he knew if he asked of God
[1:43:18] God was either going to tell him stay
[1:43:20] still or go and Conquer right
[1:43:23] that's right Hallelujah we ain't playing
[1:43:25] with the devil Hallelujah either you
[1:43:27] going to stay still or you going to go
[1:43:28] and Conquer Hallelujah in the name of
[1:43:32] the Lord and he said hallelujah amen he
[1:43:35] said shall I overtake them and he
[1:43:38] answered him
[1:43:41] pursue for thou shall surely overtake
[1:43:45] them and with the whe without fail
[1:43:49] recover all
[1:43:53] would that mean if God made that word to
[1:43:55] you tonight a
[1:44:01] reality what if God is saying to
[1:44:05] you
[1:44:07] pursue believe in
[1:44:09] me and I guarantee you you'll recover
[1:44:13] all
[1:44:15] Hall but first of all you got to inquire
[1:44:18] of
[1:44:20] God because there's a thing sometimes we
[1:44:23] ask God when we already know what we
[1:44:25] want to do right and then our intentions
[1:44:28] are not
[1:44:31] pure that's very good we say God oh lord
[1:44:34] lord should I marry this person you know
[1:44:36] Lord Lord should I just want your will
[1:44:38] but I really really want
[1:44:43] them you ain't being honest with
[1:44:46] God no sir that's what bam did
[1:44:53] Lord should I go all this people or
[1:44:54] should I stay but I really really want
[1:44:56] to
[1:44:58] go God said no don't go he go back he
[1:45:02] say I can't say what the Lord told me to
[1:45:04] say they say hey I give you some more
[1:45:05] money well I I don't know if God was
[1:45:07] sure let me go back and ask him
[1:45:11] again see he had them made contact with
[1:45:14] the wrong
[1:45:15] spirit and that thing was stronger than
[1:45:18] listening to the will of God that's
[1:45:21] right be careful for what you made
[1:45:23] contact
[1:45:24] with it'll overpower your
[1:45:30] decision I need to close
[1:45:34] church if we go back to
[1:45:37] Jacob in Genesis
[1:45:40] 32 is one of the first places where
[1:45:43] Jacob really got down and me business
[1:45:46] with
[1:45:47] God right all before then he was just
[1:45:50] using his gifts right
[1:45:54] that's I tricked myself out of this
[1:45:57] David was the first trick in the
[1:46:00] Bible David could trick I mean not David
[1:46:03] uh Jacob Jacob was the first trick he
[1:46:06] could trick you out of anything he hey
[1:46:09] hey you hungry you hungry just give me
[1:46:11] your birth
[1:46:15] right Daddy this is me Esau feel my
[1:46:21] arms chicken a
[1:46:24] everybody down to his father-in-law
[1:46:26] setting up the cattle making the big
[1:46:28] ones over the spider ones over here hey
[1:46:29] father-in-law I boy I got you some good
[1:46:31] ones over
[1:46:33] here tricking everybody trick trick
[1:46:35] trick that's
[1:46:37] right but then one
[1:46:40] day God told him I want you to go back
[1:46:43] home I want you to go back home and face
[1:46:46] everything you
[1:46:50] did one day you got the faceal s
[1:46:54] Hallelujah it wasn't so Esau he had to
[1:46:57] face he had to face himself all the
[1:46:59] stuff he did he had to face himself
[1:47:01] Hallelujah and now I'm I'm about to
[1:47:03] close don't get nervous and now he comes
[1:47:06] back he sends some gifts he send
[1:47:08] something to ease the welcome and send
[1:47:11] it down to Esau Esau send it back I
[1:47:14] don't need what you
[1:47:18] sending
[1:47:20] hallelujah hallelujah yeah I'm of
[1:47:23] ishmail side but we rich
[1:47:28] too
[1:47:31] Hallelujah he said hey send it back I
[1:47:33] don't need it and they send it back to
[1:47:35] Jacob they say Esau is coming with 400
[1:47:37] men and he send your gifts back he don't
[1:47:39] need it job oh my
[1:47:41] God now look what is he afraid of in my
[1:47:46] closing he's making contact again with
[1:47:49] his
[1:47:50] past oh boy yes sir and it's his past
[1:47:54] where he come from all the things he all
[1:47:57] the things he've done and all the things
[1:47:59] he came up against and now he's looking
[1:48:02] at his past and his past still has a
[1:48:05] hold on
[1:48:08] him he's afraid of his past Esau is
[1:48:12] coming I did Esau wrong you know what he
[1:48:15] was you know what he was hearing church
[1:48:17] when he left all he could hear was Esau
[1:48:20] saying I'mma kill you
[1:48:24] right that's right he got the birth
[1:48:27] right and he riding he riding I'mma kill
[1:48:31] you oh you can hear I'mma kill
[1:48:36] you you ever been in the mountains and
[1:48:40] you say something in an echo as far as
[1:48:41] you can go that's probably how it was
[1:48:43] with Jacob he riding away Esau say I'mma
[1:48:47] kill you
[1:48:53] right and he couldn't get away from it
[1:48:56] as many times he said it it echoed I'mma
[1:48:59] kill you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:49:02] yeah now he's remembering he's thinking
[1:49:04] about his past and that fear is
[1:49:07] overcoming him again he's made contact
[1:49:11] with that
[1:49:15] past the only thing he can do
[1:49:20] now he's been quoting it all his life
[1:49:23] the god of My Father
[1:49:25] Abraham the god of my father Isaac now
[1:49:29] it has to become his God right that's
[1:49:33] right it's not just brother brenham's
[1:49:36] God it has to be your God it can't just
[1:49:39] be brother de's God it has to be your
[1:49:41] God it can't just be brother Samuel's
[1:49:43] God it has to be your God or any other
[1:49:46] preacher you might listen to it has to
[1:49:48] be your God hallelujah whatever you
[1:49:51] stand in need of tonight it has to be
[1:49:54] from your
[1:49:56] God and the Bible says Jacob he sends
[1:49:59] his wife this way C that way Hallelujah
[1:50:02] why did he separate the family because
[1:50:04] of
[1:50:05] fear fear his imagination is taking over
[1:50:08] the situation he said oh my Esau going
[1:50:11] to come and he can kill me and my whole
[1:50:13] family I'm going run a little bit
[1:50:15] further Esau didn't come to kill right
[1:50:18] that's right he didn't come to kill but
[1:50:21] Jacob Hallelujah he had to get to this
[1:50:24] place where he could meet
[1:50:28] God good that's part two to this
[1:50:34] message maybe another
[1:50:37] time but because of his past he can't
[1:50:40] escape it only thing he know how to do
[1:50:42] is call on the god of his fathers yes to
[1:50:46] be that same God for him and he get down
[1:50:48] on his knees and he starts to pray like
[1:50:51] never before
[1:50:53] he starts to cry and call out to God
[1:50:55] like never before until an angel appears
[1:50:58] before

[1:52:35] had to touch him on his thigh Hallelujah
[1:52:37] that was the only way Jacob was going to
[1:52:39] lose

[2:20:12] and called
[2:20:14] out brother Cadre don't know but God

[2:20:27] Adam Adam we're out there God knew where
[2:20:29] Adam was hiding
[2:20:30] behind he could have went right to the

[2:20:39] you just as much as it could move in
[2:20:41] your heart when you hear him speaking at
[2:20:43] first there's a fear that could want to
[2:20:45] come to hold you back on it but let me
[2:20:47] tell you that's not the right Spirit you

[2:21:22] represented the word and if there's
[2:21:25] anything that's unresolved tonight let
[2:21:27] me tell you something looking even
[2:21:28] around this room visible but even in the

[2:24:14] this that the longer if there's
[2:24:16] something you put off the stronger and

[2:24:22] true the longer you put anything off the
[2:24:25] stronger that Spirit gets yes it does it
[2:24:28] just keeps pushing it and pushing it and

[2:24:50] heart CU not an emotion it's not a
[2:24:53] string on a piano it's not an organ
[2:24:55] that'll move you it's not your favorite
[2:24:56] song if that's all it is then that's
[2:24:58] what it's going to take every day of
[2:24:59] your life is a certain key a certain
[2:25:01] song a certain preacher a certain
[2:25:03] feeling that's not what moves us if the
[2:25:06] word of God doesn't move us then we're
[2:25:09] unmovable but it ought to be the word of
[2:25:12] God that's drawing and moving and Upon
[2:25:13] Our Hearts and the greatest compliment
[2:25:15] we can do is take a stand upon that word
[2:25:18] sometimes God requires us to move move
[2:25:20] out from where we're at because if not
[2:25:23] it becomes harder and it becomes
[2:25:25] stronger right brother Samuel have you
[2:25:27] seen that I've seen it I've watched
