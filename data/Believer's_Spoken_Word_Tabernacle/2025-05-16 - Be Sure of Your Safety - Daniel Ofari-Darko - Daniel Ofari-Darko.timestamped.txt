[26:57] with his feathers, and under his wings
[27:01] shall thou trust. His trust shall be thy
[27:05] shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be

[27:15] pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor

[27:21] day. A thousand shall fall at thy sight,
[27:24] and 10,000 at thy right hand, but it

[28:04] and against all the gods of Egypt, I
[28:07] will execute judgment. I am the Lord.
[28:10] And the blood shall be to you for a
[28:12] token upon the houses where ye are. And
[28:15] when I see the blood, I will pass over
[28:17] you. And the plague shall not be upon
[28:20] you to destroy you when I smite the land
[28:24] of Egypt. Thank you, Lord. The Lord add
[28:26] his blessing to the reading of his word.

[29:04] just
[29:06] read from Psalms
[29:10] 91, he said, "He that dwelleth in the
[29:13] secret place of the most high shall
[29:16] abide under the shadow of the almighty."
[29:19] Yeah.
[29:21] And I think there's
[29:23] nothing for a
[29:25] man to
[29:27] get than to be under the shadow of the
[29:30] almighty. Amen.
[29:32] It means you are covered.
[29:35] Amen. You are protected. Yes, sir. You
[29:38] have your security. Hallelujah. You are
[29:40] in
[29:41] safety environment. Yeah. Hallelujah. He
[29:45] said, "I will say of the Lord, he is my
[29:47] refuge and my fortress, my God, in him
[29:51] will I trust. Surely he shall deliver
[29:55] thee from the snare of the fowler and
[29:58] from the noisome pestilence any anything
[30:01] that will come upon the earth. The Lord
[30:03] is going to protect you because you are
[30:06] in a safety place." Amen. Amen. He said
[30:09] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[30:11] and under his wings shall thou trust.
[30:14] His truth shall be thy shield and
[30:17] buckler. Amen. Hallelujah. He said,
[30:20] "Thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[30:23] by night, nor for the arrow that flyth
[30:27] by day,

[30:33] darkness, nor for the destruction that
[30:35] wasteth at noonday." Right. Hallelujah.
[30:39] You see, it means when you are under
[30:42] that shadow of the almighty,
[30:46] nothing unward can touch you. Pless God
[30:50] because you are protected.
[30:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And brother, you
[30:54] and I, we know that we need safety.
[30:58] Every human needs security. Sure.
[31:02] Hallelujah. Because we were born with
[31:04] fear in us, right? And fear is part of
[31:07] human sir in our journeys in anything
[31:11] that we do we entertain fear sometimes
[31:15] and God himself is aware of that.
[31:19] That is why anytime when he call his
[31:21] people he say fear not. Amen.
[31:24] Hallelujah. Because he want to drag the
[31:27] fear away from you before he deal with
[31:29] you. So human being we need security. We
[31:34] need safety. Yes sir. Hallelujah. And
[31:37] that safety, brother, we don't produce
[31:39] it. No, no, no, no, no, no. There is
[31:41] nothing you can do to have that safety.
[31:45] The safety is at only one source and
[31:48] that is in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[31:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother, no, no,
[31:53] no, nothing, nothing, nothing in this
[31:55] world can produce security. And
[31:57] sometimes, you know, the world talk
[32:00] about certain things that they are not
[32:01] aware of.
[32:05] Since time in
[32:07] memorial, we see a lot of presidents who
[32:11] have come, a lot of you know well
[32:14] notable leaders who have traveled all
[32:16] over the world trying to you know make
[32:19] sure that there is safety make sure that
[32:21] the people are are safe in whatever
[32:24] environment that they live. Have they
[32:26] been able to achieve it? Nope.
[32:29] Nope. They talk about peace, peace,
[32:31] peace. Have they been able to achieve
[32:33] it? No. No. Because there is only one
[32:35] source of peace. Hallelujah. There is
[32:39] only one source of security.
[32:42] And that you can find only under the
[32:44] shadow of the almighty. Glory to God.
[32:46] Praise be the name of our God.
[32:48] Hallelujah. We live in fear because
[32:51] brother we don't people even don't know
[32:52] what is going to happen the next minute
[32:54] ahead of us. Yeah.
[32:56] And sometime we live in confusions. Y
[32:59] okay. We we live in a situation whereby
[33:03] we don't know what is going to be. True.
[33:06] What is going to happen tomorrow, right?
[33:08] Hallelujah. True. The next minute ahead
[33:11] of us, what is going to happen?
[33:14] We don't know. No. That is why when you
[33:18] are walking by the roadside and the
[33:20] driver blow a horn on you, papa, you
[33:23] jump.
[33:25] Because you want safety, right?
[33:29] Hallelujah.
[33:31] Somebody can just follow you and will
[33:33] just scare you somehow. Hey, and you you
[33:36] will shake because there is fear in you.
[33:41] Hallelujah. You want to be you want to
[33:43] be protected.
[33:46] Huh? Even in the animal kingdom. Yeah.
[33:50] In the animal kingdom, they also rely on
[33:53] safety. Yes. That is why when a deer is
[33:58] eating
[34:00] They look around. Yeah. To see whether a
[34:03] predator is coming to attack them.
[34:08] The moment they get a hit of a lion,
[34:10] they jump and run.
[34:13] Hallelujah. They have that kind of fear
[34:15] in them. Even the animals. That's right.
[34:19] When the baboon see the gorilla, it run
[34:22] away because it's afraid.
[34:25] Wow. How much more human being? Yeah.
[34:28] Hallelujah. That is why human being you
[34:31] need something we call security.
[34:36] Amen. You need to find out whether you
[34:38] are secured.
[34:41] You need to find out whether you are a
[34:43] safety point.
[34:46] And brother, you don't produce that.
[34:51] Oh brother, you don't produce that. No
[34:53] money on this earth can give you
[34:55] security. Come on now. Hallelujah.
[34:59] We see the millionaires and the
[35:01] billionaires, especially those who have
[35:03] dubious business, they surround
[35:05] themselves with a lot of security.
[35:09] That's good. That's right. With gun
[35:10] here, with gun here, with gun here, with
[35:12] gun here, but eventually what happened?
[35:16] They die. They are killed sometimes.
[35:19] Right. What is where is that security
[35:21] from? Hallelujah. Your education cannot
[35:24] give you security. Your money cannot
[35:27] give you security.
[35:29] Hallelujah. How popular you are in
[35:31] society cannot give you security. There
[35:33] is only one source of security. And I
[35:36] said that is what you can find under the
[35:38] shadow of the almighty.
[35:40] Praise be the name of our God.
[35:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother,
[35:47] sister, a time came even in
[35:51] Israel when God divided the army of
[35:55] Israel into four
[35:59] groups. Judah was leading one
[36:02] group. Dan was leading one group. And
[36:05] then Ephraim was leading one
[36:09] group. And there was another one. I
[36:11] think Ruben was also leading one group.
[36:15] And in their midst was the ark of the
[36:18] covenant
[36:20] which was the security of all Israel.
[36:24] And brother when they are marching to
[36:25] war who is the enemy you cannot stand
[36:29] when Israel is coming on on the on the m
[36:32] to war because the almighty God was with
[36:36] him.
[36:38] Amen. Hallelujah. So long as Israel stay
[36:42] with the word of God. Amen. The
[36:44] protections of God was upon them. Yes,
[36:46] sir.
[36:48] It was one time when they backslided and
[36:50] they were doing anything they wanted and
[36:53] they went to a war and they were beaten.
[36:56] Yeah. I think that was the time of uh of
[37:00] uh uh the priest Eli. They were beaten
[37:03] if you remember carefully, right? They
[37:05] bashed. Everybody was doing anything at
[37:07] all that they wanted. So when they were
[37:10] beaten by the Philistines, right? Then
[37:13] they said that no, let us go and fetch
[37:15] the ark of the covenant.
[37:17] Oh brother, that was the most miserable
[37:20] day of Israel. Yeah. They thought that
[37:23] when they have the covenant, it will be
[37:26] their security. Yeah. And of course, the
[37:29] enemies always are afraid of Israel
[37:32] because of the ark. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So
[37:36] when the ark was brought into their
[37:38] midst that day, they started shouting.
[37:42] They started jubilating. They started
[37:44] singing praises unto the Lord and the
[37:47] Philistines heard of it and they asked
[37:51] what is this that we are hearing this
[37:52] Israel you know shouting and and and
[37:55] know making you know and they said well
[37:58] we heard that they have brought the ark
[37:59] of the covenant into their midst and the
[38:02] Philistines became afraid. Hallelujah.
[38:06] Yes, they became afraid because they
[38:07] knew that so long the ark of the
[38:10] covenant has come into the midst of
[38:12] Israel, they are finished. They are dead
[38:14] because that is their security. That is
[38:16] their power. Amen. But brother, what
[38:20] good will it do to you? When you're the
[38:22] covenant of God in your midst,
[38:25] and you don't apply the mechanism,
[38:29] you don't apply the word of God. You
[38:32] don't live by the word of God, the
[38:34] instructions of God, you don't live with
[38:36] it. How can the covenant perform?
[38:42] God don't do things like that.
[38:44] Hallelujah. God always deal by his word.
[38:48] Yeah. So having the covenant alone in
[38:52] your midst doesn't make the miracle.
[38:56] But how sincere and faithful you are.
[39:02] Then God will perform. Yes sir.
[39:04] Hallelujah. Brother, today we will say
[39:07] that the Lord has blessed us with such a
[39:10] mighty presence of God in our midst. I
[39:13] say that because we have the message of
[39:15] this hour in our midst.
[39:18] And that is God revealed.
[39:21] Hallelujah. To his people. And that is
[39:24] the security we have today. No matter
[39:28] what is going on in this world, brother,
[39:30] we look to the message.
[39:33] We look to the message because that is
[39:34] where our power lies.
[39:37] No other thing, no confusion anywhere.
[39:40] Well, people are trying to say so many
[39:42] things about the message and the message
[39:43] is this. We don't care about that. No.
[39:46] No. I don't want to care about those
[39:48] things, brother. No. I don't care about
[39:50] whatever people are talking about.
[39:52] That's right. My only aim is to see what
[39:55] the Lord brought. Hallelujah. Through
[39:58] that prophet and that is it.
[40:02] I don't want anybody to make any
[40:03] commentary on the message for me.
[40:06] Hallelujah. The message itself is
[40:08] commentary that I need to my life to
[40:11] strengthen me and that is why I stand.
[40:14] Hallelujah. No commentary from any
[40:15] source. That's right. Glory to God. Only
[40:19] one God. Right. Only one prophet. Right.
[40:23] And only one message. That's right.
[40:26] Can I hear amen? Amen. That is it. And
[40:30] that is where our security lies. Amen.
[40:33] Amen. Brother,
[40:35] sometime people want to
[40:38] tread without authority.
[40:43] People want to take inventory
[40:46] when they have no clue
[40:49] and it is dangerous. Yes.
[40:53] When the Israelites thought that because
[40:55] the ark of the covenant has come into
[40:57] their hands, they were going to defeat
[41:00] their enemy.
[41:02] They deceived themselves.
[41:04] The Bible said that that day Israel were
[41:08] beaten. Yeah.
[41:10] And even the act of the commonant was
[41:13] seized
[41:14] by the unbelievers. Can you imagine
[41:16] this? True.
[41:19] Where was their security then?
[41:22] Hallelujah.
[41:25] But look at what God did.
[41:29] The power of God that was on the uh what
[41:34] the ark
[41:36] was still there
[41:38] and it was there to work for the
[41:41] children of God.
[41:44] But the children of God prove stubborn
[41:46] against their God. Right? So God refused
[41:50] to attend to them. True. But when the
[41:54] Philistines took the ark of the covenant
[41:57] into their midst, look at what happened
[41:59] there. Yeah. There were a whole lot of
[42:02] troubles. Oh brother, the Bible said
[42:04] that God struck them with, you know, so
[42:06] many h pestilence and all sickness and
[42:10] diseases. They say men were scratching
[42:13] themselves all over.
[42:15] Because of what they did by taking the
[42:18] covenant. Yeah. They were not worthy to
[42:20] take the ark. No. No. They were not
[42:23] worthy. But because of what Israel did.
[42:27] Yeah. My brother, sister,
[42:29] the Lord has blessed us.
[42:33] The Lord has blessed us so much. Yes, I
[42:35] like that.
[42:37] But sometimes we ourselves, we don't
[42:40] value it. Amen.
[42:43] Many people don't want to value what God
[42:46] has done to us. Hallelujah. When I was
[42:50] coming with brother Richard, we were
[42:52] discussing about ourselves, our lives.
[42:55] When we were in a Pentecostal
[42:59] rea, it was in this
[43:02] message that by the grace of God we
[43:06] started living a Christian life.
[43:11] It was in the message. So we can we
[43:14] cannot underestimate the power of this
[43:16] message. No. Hallelujah. And that is
[43:20] where God is protecting you and I. Yes.
[43:24] Thank you, Father. And we have to be
[43:26] sure that we are under that security.
[43:31] Let us be sure that we are safe in the
[43:35] message of this hour.
[43:38] Don't give your ears to what people are
[43:41] saying. Praise the truth. Trying to turn
[43:44] the message upside down. No,
[43:47] brother. They can continue to do
[43:49] whatever they want to do. They can
[43:50] continue to say whatever they want to
[43:52] say. Hallelujah. But the message remain
[43:56] the message.
[44:00] Just God bless you over there. The
[44:03] message remain the message.
[44:07] Hallelujah. Amen.
[44:09] You see when
[44:11] Israel were to leave Egypt, look at
[44:14] another condition. When Israel were to
[44:17] leave
[44:18] Egypt, God sent a prophet Moses to tell
[44:20] them that that night he was going to
[44:24] pass over the place and was going to
[44:26] kill the firstborns of the Egyptians.
[44:30] And every
[44:31] Israeli should kill a lamb. Okay.
[44:36] As they have kept it for some days. And
[44:39] they should apply the blood on the
[44:42] lentils of their daughters.
[44:45] That was their requirement,
[44:48] right? That was their security. That was
[44:51] their protection. And God said, "When I
[44:54] see the blood,
[44:56] I'll pass over." Hallelujah.
[45:01] They were in
[45:03] Gan. But God said, I mean, God should
[45:06] have chosen to not to I mean, do that.
[45:09] He would have chosen to go to Egypt and
[45:12] destroy whatever he wanted to destroy.
[45:14] But he said, "My children, even though
[45:17] you are in go, uhoh, when Egypt is in
[45:21] darkness, I give you light, right?
[45:25] But yet still, I want you to apply the
[45:28] token on your lentils of your doors,
[45:33] brother. You can you cannot tell me that
[45:34] you are a Israeli and for that matter
[45:37] you are saved already. So you will not
[45:41] apply that blood. You couldn't do that.
[45:45] You couldn't do that, brother. You
[45:47] couldn't do that. Then it means you
[45:50] don't like the
[45:51] safety. You don't like the security of
[45:54] God. He said, "Apply the token down
[45:56] there." And that is what I want to see.
[46:00] So if you Israel, you say I'm Israel. I
[46:02] I don't care about that. You'll be dead.
[46:05] Right? The death angel will enter into
[46:07] your room and house and destroy you.
[46:09] Destroy. Maybe you are a firstborn. He
[46:11] will destroy you and destroy your
[46:12] firstborn also.
[46:15] Amen. So when they apply the token over
[46:22] there, the dead angel descended that
[46:25] night and march all over the
[46:29] province. What was he looking for? He
[46:32] was looking for the people that have
[46:35] made themselves sure to be under the
[46:39] safety of God.
[46:42] And the moment they saw the blood down,
[46:44] they pass over.
[46:47] In fact, the death angel bra will not
[46:50] enter into any house
[46:53] and ask who are here. Is brother Bill
[46:57] here? Is brother Cruz here? Is brother
[47:01] Gomez here, brother Naomi here? No, the
[47:03] death angel would not do that.
[47:06] That was not his business. His business
[47:09] was to look on the doorpost and see
[47:12] whether there is blood there. Period.
[47:16] Amen. Hallelujah. The death angel don't
[47:19] care who are in the house. Amen.
[47:24] He doesn't care who are in the house. So
[47:25] long as the people are under the
[47:27] talking,
[47:30] And that is their security. Amen. Amen.
[47:33] Amen. Sometime this thing disturbs
[47:39] sometime it distracts.
[47:42] Sorry. Hallelujah. Are you catching it
[47:44] brothers, sisters? Sure. So it the
[47:46] business of the angel to find out how
[47:49] many people are there. Are they
[47:50] Egyptians or they Israelites or they
[47:53] Moabites? No.
[47:56] So anyone that was under the talking Yes
[48:00] sir. was saved. Right.
[48:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother, if an
[48:09] Israeli will have mercy and tell a
[48:13] friend Egyptian,
[48:15] hey this what the Lord is going to do.
[48:18] If you want safety, come to my house.
[48:20] Sir
[48:22] if they have done that those people will
[48:25] be saved because they will be under the
[48:28] token of God.
[48:32] But well we don't have any history like
[48:33] that
[48:35] it was only communicated to the sons of
[48:38] God
[48:40] and as much as they applied the token
[48:42] they were under that security
[48:47] the death angel passed over them. Yes.
[48:50] And they were not able to be touched by
[48:54] any disruption. True. But over there in
[48:58] Egypt, oh my
[49:00] where there was no security,
[49:03] there was no talking applied to any lint
[49:05] of any door.
[49:08] The Bible said that they cried.
[49:12] They whail. Yeah. Yeah.
[49:16] They suffered. Yes.
[49:18] because they were humans without any
[49:21] security.
[49:24] Brother, sister, look at the condition
[49:27] the world is in now. Oh yeah, sir. Yeah.
[49:32] The condition of this world is so
[49:34] miserable.
[49:36] Yes, it is. And they that they have not
[49:39] even realized that.
[49:42] Talk to a person on the street. Y and
[49:45] tell him
[49:46] that Jesus Christ is coming again soon.
[49:51] And you tell to your business. Right.
[49:54] True. I am also a Christian. You're
[49:57] right. I attend so and so church.
[50:00] Hallelujah. They have made they are
[50:03] relying on
[50:04] something that cannot give them life.
[50:08] Something that cannot give them
[50:10] security. something that cannot give
[50:12] them
[50:13] salvation. Hallelujah. But they don't
[50:16] realize that how miserable that is.
[50:20] That's why the prophet said that we
[50:21] should pity them. And we are still
[50:23] pitying them. Praise be the name of our
[50:26] God. Hallelujah. So he
[50:30] said, "He that dwelleth in the secret
[50:32] place of the most high, I love that
[50:34] scripture. shall abide under the shadow
[50:38] of the Almighty. Hallelujah.
[50:44] Not under the shadow of what you can
[50:46] think with your mind. No. Not under the
[50:50] shadow of what you can do by yourself.
[50:54] Hallelujah. Not under the shadow of your
[50:57] flex
[50:58] security, but under the shadow of the
[51:01] Almighty.
[51:03] I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge.
[51:06] Amen. And my fortress, yes, sir. My God,
[51:09] in him will I trust. Hallelujah. Surely
[51:12] he shall deliver thee from the snare of
[51:15] the fowler and from the knowome
[51:18] pestilence.
[51:23] Nothing. The believer should be afraid
[51:26] of nothing.
[51:28] Yes, sir. In fact, the Bible say that we
[51:30] should be bold as the lions. Amen. Any
[51:36] situation that we find ourselves, we
[51:39] should be bold. Amen. We should be bold
[51:42] as liars. Brother, sister, look,
[51:45] anywhere we are, we have to let that
[51:49] feeling be in us.
[51:52] We should not walk as
[51:54] people with fear.
[51:57] No.
[51:59] If you do that, you defeat your own
[52:02] faith.
[52:05] You walk with boldness and of sound
[52:08] mind.
[52:09] Because you know that there is a great
[52:14] security around us. Hallelujah.
[52:16] Hallelujah. And that was what Elisha
[52:19] demonstrated when the Syrian soldiers
[52:22] were sent to arrest him.
[52:26] And his servant saw the
[52:29] soldiers and they started he started
[52:32] crying said Allah master we are
[52:34] finished. Yeah we are finished. Yeah.
[52:38] The servant didn't know anything. The
[52:41] servant couldn't see what Elisha have
[52:44] seen. Right. Hallelujah. But it did not
[52:46] disturb Elijah because Elisha knew that
[52:50] those that are with them, they are more
[52:53] than what his servant was seeing. Amen.
[52:57] He said, "Lord, will you open the eye of
[52:59] my servant?"
[53:01] And when the Lord opened the eye of his
[53:03] servant and he raised his eye, he said
[53:07] all around the mountains there were
[53:09] chariots. There were chariots of fire.
[53:12] The angel have surrounded and they were
[53:15] guarding Elisha.
[53:17] [Music]
[53:19] Hallelujah.
[53:21] Elisha didn't entertain any fear. No.
[53:26] Why should I, brother Ray? Amen. Why
[53:29] should I entertain fear
[53:31] when the prophet of God in this end time
[53:36] has told me? All right. Hallelujah. I
[53:40] say he has told me. Amen. Yeah. That
[53:43] this message of this hour wherever it
[53:47] will be preached, the pillar of fire
[53:49] will be there. Hallelujah. Why should I
[53:53] be afraid without any doubt this
[53:55] evening? I know that he is here. And
[53:58] that give me courage. Glory. That give
[54:01] me strength. That give me sound mind and
[54:05] I can assertain that I am under that
[54:09] security. Yeah, I am under that shadow
[54:12] of the almighty. There is no cause for
[54:15] any alarm. Don't be afraid of the things
[54:18] that is going on in this world, brother
[54:20] or sister.
[54:22] He said when you see things coming and
[54:26] you are so dejected, you are so troubled
[54:30] and he say look up.
[54:33] Hallelujah. He said look up. Amen and
[54:37] amen. He say look up.
[54:40] But today let's listen to what the
[54:43] prophet said here about the token. He
[54:45] said but in this glorious place under
[54:49] this covenant there is difference
[54:52] between the blood and the
[54:54] life. The token for the believer today
[54:57] is the Holy Ghost. Amen. And that is
[55:00] your security.
[55:02] Not the blood a chemistry but it is the
[55:05] Holy Spirit of God that is the token
[55:08] that God require of the church today.
[55:11] God must see this token. He must see it
[55:15] in everyone of us.
[55:20] Meaning you must make sure that you have
[55:24] that security. You must make sure that
[55:27] you are in safety place.
[55:32] Amen. He said to the world is a bench of
[55:36] foolishness but to God it is the only
[55:41] way. The only thing he require is that
[55:44] token. It must be
[55:48] there and you cannot have the token
[55:50] until the fair is paid. Then you are a
[55:53] possessor of the token which gives you
[55:55] the privilege of a free pass.
[55:59] Hallelujah.
[56:00] You see it now. When you have it, you
[56:03] have a free pass. Thank you, Jesus.
[56:05] Amen. When you have that security,
[56:08] brother, nothing can harm you, sister.
[56:10] Nothing can harm you. Thank you, Lord.
[56:13] Hallelujah. Nothing. He said pestilence
[56:15] will come, but it will not touch you.
[56:19] Because you are under the shadow of the
[56:22] almighty.
[56:23] That is your
[56:25] security. Amen.
[56:28] He
[56:30] said when I see the blood I'll pass over
[56:32] you. What a
[56:35] time that what a privilege to know that
[56:39] you pack within you that
[56:41] pass. When I see the blood I will pass
[56:45] over you
[56:47] is the only thing that he
[56:50] recognize is nothing else that can take
[56:53] its place. Amen. No substitute, no. No
[56:57] denomination, no. Nothing else. It takes
[57:01] that.
[57:04] It takes that.
[57:06] Hallelujah.
[57:12] You remember one time when
[57:14] uh the two brothers Salmon and the other
[57:18] one was sent by General
[57:21] Joshua to
[57:23] go and spy Jericho.
[57:26] The Bible told us that they found
[57:29] themselves in a prostitute's home
[57:34] and
[57:35] surprisingly the prostitute handled them
[57:38] very nicely
[57:40] because their presence
[57:43] alone made the woman to realize no these
[57:46] people are not ordinary people right
[57:48] glory I know my business I know men come
[57:51] to me for a a particular business but
[57:54] these people are not that type. Right?
[57:58] So she treated them with a special care.
[58:03] And then she herself said, "We
[58:06] know that your God have given you this
[58:11] land." Yeah. Right. We know that you are
[58:14] coming to take over this our land.
[58:18] But please
[58:21] be merciful on me.
[58:24] My father, my mother and my siblings.
[58:28] Hallelujah. Amen. Whatever happened
[58:31] between them and the
[58:33] woman? At the end, the woman requested
[58:38] security.
[58:40] Hallelujah. A sinner. Yeah. Who have
[58:44] recognized the power of God. Yeah.
[58:47] She had no other choice
[58:50] but to surrender.
[58:53] She knew, she was aware that Jericho is
[58:56] doomed.
[58:58] Judgment of Jericho has come. It was
[59:01] eminent. So she needed a safety
[59:05] place. Praise be the name of our God.
[59:08] She needed a safety place. And the only
[59:11] safety place she could found was what
[59:14] promise these two men will give her.
[59:19] So she said, "Wow,
[59:23] give me a true token."
[59:26] And promise me, hallelujah. Not just a
[59:30] token, but a true token. Yeah.
[59:35] Hallelujah.
[59:36] You cannot hide yourself in in in any
[59:41] church just like that and think that you
[59:44] have security. No
[59:48] it's not your
[59:49] choice. It's the choice of Jesus Christ.
[59:53] It's the choice of the almighty God. The
[59:56] woman said give me a true token. I know
[59:59] there are a lot of tokens but I want the
[1:00:01] true one. Right. Amen. And that should
[1:00:04] that is what every genuine believer
[1:00:07] should do that anyone that is coming to
[1:00:10] the Lord that is what you must require.
[1:00:12] Ask the Lord Lord give me the true
[1:00:14] church.
[1:00:16] Hallelujah. Not just write my name in a
[1:00:18] in a book.
[1:00:21] Amen. That they will tell me that I'm a
[1:00:24] member of church ABC.
[1:00:27] Right. Or I'm a member of church B.
[1:00:31] Right. I don't want that, bro. Lord, I
[1:00:33] want a true church.
[1:00:36] A church that can change my character.
[1:00:40] Amen. A church that can make me a clean
[1:00:45] child of God. Hallelujah. A church that
[1:00:48] can put me on the word of God.
[1:00:52] Hallelujah. That's right. Like God told
[1:00:54] the Israelites, he said, "When you kill
[1:00:57] the animal, put it direct on the fire.
[1:01:00] Amen.
[1:01:02] Because the
[1:01:05] flesh must experience the direct heat
[1:01:10] from the fire.
[1:01:12] Don't put it in any pot or silver and
[1:01:17] put water on it. No, he said put the
[1:01:20] flesh on the direct fire because that
[1:01:22] was the requirement. God wanted the fat
[1:01:27] to melt, right?
[1:01:29] Every fat in that animal must melt into
[1:01:33] the fire to burn. That's good. Because
[1:01:36] you know fat when you eat too much fat,
[1:01:38] you know what happens?
[1:01:40] Hallelujah. That is why many people, you
[1:01:42] know, veins are blocked. It's all
[1:01:44] because of fat. Yeah. God said let the
[1:01:48] fat melt down. Yeah. And today you and
[1:01:52] I, we are also sacrificed. We must be
[1:01:55] put on God's word, which is the fire.
[1:01:58] The Holy Ghost is a fire. It's a
[1:02:00] consuming fire. We must be put on the
[1:02:02] direct fire. And let the word of God
[1:02:05] melt any fat that is in us. Any fat of
[1:02:09] unbelief,
[1:02:11] any fat of starchiness, any fat of
[1:02:13] laziness, hallelujah, any fat of
[1:02:17] lukewarmness, the word of God must bend
[1:02:20] it. Yes. Amen. And make us presentable.
[1:02:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it's not just
[1:02:28] a token, beloved. It must be a true
[1:02:31] token. Hallelujah.
[1:02:34] Amen.
[1:02:36] And
[1:02:38] Salmon. And the other man said, well, if
[1:02:41] you have requested for the safety of
[1:02:43] your life, we give to
[1:02:46] you this
[1:02:48] thread that we are going to descend by.
[1:02:51] Mhm.
[1:02:53] When we go
[1:02:55] the day you hear that we are coming tie
[1:02:59] it
[1:03:01] at your window.
[1:03:03] Glory. And that will stand as your
[1:03:05] safety point. Hallelujah. And they told
[1:03:09] her, "Go and bring your father, your
[1:03:12] mother.
[1:03:14] All your friends, your loved ones, those
[1:03:17] who can believe you, bring them under
[1:03:20] the shadow.
[1:03:24] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:26] But the only thing is that don't tell
[1:03:28] anyone because it's a secret place.
[1:03:34] It is what? A secret place. Amen. He
[1:03:38] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[1:03:42] most high. So it is a secret place.
[1:03:47] Salmon told um uh Rahab don't tell
[1:03:51] anyone just go and bring them.
[1:03:56] Rahab went and Rahab was trying to tell
[1:03:59] the people somehow maybe he has seen his
[1:04:02] her friend. Hey friend, will you come to
[1:04:05] my house? That is the only place
[1:04:08] security will be for you. You know
[1:04:10] Jericho, he she has tend to be an
[1:04:12] evangelist.
[1:04:14] One time a prostitute now an evangelist
[1:04:17] telling people about the safety of God.
[1:04:21] Whether you believe it or not, that was
[1:04:23] it.
[1:04:25] If you like life, if you want salvation,
[1:04:28] you must come under the shadow of Rahab.
[1:04:32] That was where the security was.
[1:04:36] People people will be laughing at her.
[1:04:38] People will be scing her. They'll be
[1:04:40] looking down. But look at this woman.
[1:04:42] Yeah. This prostitute telling us about
[1:04:46] the God of Israel. When did she repent?
[1:04:52] But Ruth, I'm sorry. Rea told
[1:04:57] them. He told him that once I was a
[1:05:01] sinner but now
[1:05:04] now
[1:05:06] now if you talk about my past
[1:05:12] it's it has nothing to to write home
[1:05:15] about. But now
[1:05:19] hallelujah now I am a saint.
[1:05:23] I believe the God of the Israelites.
[1:05:26] You ask me why I'm happy. So I'll just
[1:05:30] tell you why. Because my sins are gone.
[1:05:35] Whether you like it or not, my sins are
[1:05:39] gone. Amen. Hallelujah. When I meet the
[1:05:42] scoffers, they ask me where they are, I
[1:05:45] tell them it's under the blood of Jesus.
[1:05:49] That was Rea.
[1:05:51] You couldn't take that from her. She had
[1:05:54] an experience. Yes, with the
[1:05:56] invisibility of our God. And she knew
[1:05:59] that God is able to save. And she knew
[1:06:02] that if he found herself under his
[1:06:05] shadow, she will have life.
[1:06:08] And that was exactly what she did.
[1:06:11] The Bible say that she went and called
[1:06:13] the father, the mother, right? And the
[1:06:16] siblings, right? And all of them they
[1:06:19] came into her house. Yeah. Once upon a
[1:06:24] time, the house of prostitution.
[1:06:27] Hallelujah.
[1:06:30] But the presence of God turn it into
[1:06:33] another thing.
[1:06:36] Oh Jesus, have mercy on us. That is why
[1:06:39] brother, sister, don't look to your old
[1:06:41] past and condemn yourself. God have made
[1:06:45] something new out of you.
[1:06:48] God has made something new out of you
[1:06:50] and that is what you must focus on not
[1:06:53] the bad past. Hallelujah. Amen. Come
[1:06:59] and take your position in the Lord under
[1:07:02] the shadow of the almighty.
[1:07:07] But you know what Rahab did?
[1:07:11] They told her when you hear that we are
[1:07:14] coming
[1:07:16] tie the rope.
[1:07:20] But she didn't do that. R she didn't
[1:07:23] wait. Ah why should why should she wait?
[1:07:28] What about the day that she will hear
[1:07:31] that Israel is coming? Maybe she'll be
[1:07:34] down with some flu or maybe she'll be
[1:07:37] down with some waste pins. She couldn't
[1:07:40] climb the window and tie
[1:07:42] it. So that day the Bible say that when
[1:07:46] you hear his voice, harden not your
[1:07:49] heart. Amen. Is that not the what the
[1:07:51] scripture says? So when Rahab heard that
[1:07:54] good news, she didn't harden her heart.
[1:07:57] Immediately when the brothers left her,
[1:08:00] she tied the rope at the window.
[1:08:05] Amen. And the securities started flying
[1:08:08] up and down. Well, people will see look
[1:08:13] at what this woman is doing. What is she
[1:08:14] doing
[1:08:15] today? We see that she has started on
[1:08:17] red rope and the wind is blowing it left
[1:08:20] and right. What has become of this
[1:08:22] woman? They didn't know that Rahab has
[1:08:26] taken her refuge under the shadow of the
[1:08:29] Almighty.
[1:08:31] Hallelujah. And it was not quite long,
[1:08:33] brother.
[1:08:36] When Jer Jericho
[1:08:38] saw Israel army surrounded them,
[1:08:45] and according to the instructions of
[1:08:46] God,
[1:08:49] General Joshua led the army and the
[1:08:51] convention to do it exactly.
[1:08:54] You see, you must always be according to
[1:08:57] the word, not according to your mind.
[1:09:01] Amen. The reason why many
[1:09:04] people are conflicting the message,
[1:09:09] the reason why many
[1:09:10] people are even out of the message is
[1:09:14] because they allow their mind
[1:09:18] to speak to them
[1:09:21] instead of they allowing the message to
[1:09:23] speak to them.
[1:09:26] Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] This is a revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:31] When we talk about a message, message
[1:09:32] message, it is nothing but the
[1:09:34] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:38] Amen.
[1:09:40] So, General Joshua did it according to
[1:09:43] the word of God. And on the seventh
[1:09:45] round, when all the congregation were
[1:09:49] shouting, praising God, trumpets were
[1:09:52] being blown, what happened? The walls of
[1:09:55] Jericho fell flat
[1:09:58] and they died. Right? But look at the
[1:10:01] safety of God. Look at the power of God.
[1:10:05] Look at the dividends when you found
[1:10:07] yourself under the shadow of the
[1:10:09] Almighty securing your security. Amen.
[1:10:12] The house of Rahab was situated on the
[1:10:16] walls of Jericho. Right.
[1:10:19] And all the walls of Jericho broke down.
[1:10:22] But the portion that the house of Rahab
[1:10:25] was situated, it stood there.
[1:10:28] Hallelujah. What was the reason? It was
[1:10:31] because of her security. Amen. It was
[1:10:35] because he seek security in the Lord
[1:10:39] Jesus.
[1:10:42] And today,
[1:10:44] my brother and my sister, I thank God
[1:10:47] for your life that you have also taken
[1:10:49] that inventory.
[1:10:51] I thank God for your life that you has
[1:10:54] also come under that shadow. Amen. I
[1:10:56] thank God for your life that you are
[1:10:59] assessing yourself day and night and
[1:11:02] make sure that you are in
[1:11:06] the shadow of the almighty.
[1:11:09] Make sure that you are in and not out.
[1:11:16] I said we don't know what is going to
[1:11:17] happen tomorrow. Many many things will
[1:11:19] be flying here and
[1:11:21] there. Get ready brother and sister. I
[1:11:24] said get ready. There are so many things
[1:11:26] that is going to be but let us stay put
[1:11:29] to the message of the hour.
[1:11:32] And let's leave the rest for God to do.
[1:11:35] Amen. We are under the shadow of the
[1:11:37] almighty. Our security is safe, secured.
[1:11:44] No cause for alarm.
[1:11:47] Let me give you a testimony before I
[1:11:49] close.
[1:11:51] There is a police officer in my
[1:11:55] church and
[1:11:57] uh he was transferred to
[1:12:01] um an another part of our
[1:12:05] country and you know this
[1:12:08] brother went to the place with God in
[1:12:13] him. He was far away from us.
[1:12:17] So many years there was no church
[1:12:21] around but he kept the fire of God
[1:12:23] burning within him. He made sure that
[1:12:28] the
[1:12:29] atmosphere okay the community that he
[1:12:33] was in at that time he will always make
[1:12:37] sure that Jesus will work within him.
[1:12:41] Praise God. And as much as he tried to
[1:12:44] tell people about the
[1:12:47] message, at the same time the
[1:12:52] criminals in those
[1:12:54] areas wanted to bribe him so that he
[1:12:59] will they will not be
[1:13:01] arrested. They tried and tried and
[1:13:03] tried. The brother never accepted any of
[1:13:06] it.
[1:13:08] So you know he ended up creating enemies
[1:13:12] to himself and he didn't
[1:13:15] know and one day there was a conflict
[1:13:18] between two
[1:13:20] groups and the commander instructed him
[1:13:23] to go and settle the
[1:13:27] matter. When the brother got there and
[1:13:31] these two factions saw
[1:13:33] him, they said, "Oh, it's you. We will
[1:13:38] kill you today." Yes.
[1:13:42] It just like for the Pharisees and the
[1:13:45] Sadducees don't agree, but they came
[1:13:49] together to kill Jesus. Y the brother
[1:13:51] was almost going to experience the same
[1:13:53] thing. Two fascists that were not in
[1:13:55] agreement and they were fighting. The
[1:13:57] moment they saw this brother, all of
[1:13:59] them said, "Oh, it's you. We will kill
[1:14:01] you today." So the brother said, he
[1:14:05] said, "Pastor, immediately then I prayed
[1:14:09] silently because I saw that they were
[1:14:12] they were coming on me." So I prayed
[1:14:16] silently. I said, "Lord, if this is your
[1:14:20] will, then so be it. But if it is not
[1:14:23] your will, I want you to I want you to
[1:14:25] save me from the hands of this people.
[1:14:28] Right? And he said,
[1:14:31] "Amen." Silently within him. Praise the
[1:14:34] Lord. He said, "Pastor, the moment I
[1:14:36] said, amenise, they were almost closed
[1:14:38] on me with their catales, machetes, and
[1:14:41] their sticks."
[1:14:43] He said, "Then
[1:14:45] immediately they
[1:14:48] stopped and they stared at me for some
[1:14:51] time." Glory. Nobody said a word.
[1:14:55] And I started seeing them going one by
[1:14:57] one, one by one, one by one. And they
[1:15:01] all left me.
[1:15:04] I said, "Praise God, brother. The Lord
[1:15:07] have delivered and saved you from the
[1:15:09] hands of the enemy."
[1:15:12] Indeed, they meant to do something evil.
[1:15:15] But because you have taken your refuge
[1:15:19] in the most high, you see the salvation.
[1:15:23] Hallelujah. Amen. So we started praying
[1:15:26] to the
[1:15:27] Lord that he will be transferred from
[1:15:30] that dangerous place. I said, "Brother,
[1:15:34] this story reminds me of when one day
[1:15:37] Jesus Christ was in the temple and the
[1:15:40] Pharisees brought a woman that was
[1:15:41] caught in adultery. Yes. Yeah. They
[1:15:44] said, "Master, this woman has been
[1:15:46] caught in
[1:15:47] adultery." And the Lord said, "We should
[1:15:49] kill her. What do you say? Tell us
[1:15:51] something." And Jesus stood on the
[1:15:54] ground and he wrote
[1:15:56] and he stood up and said that, "Well,
[1:15:59] you have condemned this woman because
[1:16:01] you caught her in adultery. Fine, that
[1:16:04] is the law.
[1:16:07] But anyone that is among you who have
[1:16:11] not sinned
[1:16:13] should first cast the stone
[1:16:18] and they were standing with their stones
[1:16:19] like this.
[1:16:21] No one was able to cast the stone
[1:16:24] and the Bible say they started living
[1:16:28] one by one. Right. Right. One by one
[1:16:32] starting from the elders. Right. And
[1:16:34] eventually all of them left. And I told
[1:16:37] your brother that this is what God have
[1:16:39] done for you. Remember that woman.
[1:16:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we pray to
[1:16:47] the Lord. We pray to the Lord. Oh Lord
[1:16:50] Jesus.
[1:16:51] Let this brother be transferred from the
[1:16:53] place. And the Lord heard our prayers.
[1:16:57] And within no time the brother was
[1:17:00] transferred to another place, another
[1:17:03] town. But that was not the end. R you
[1:17:07] see when God save you from one
[1:17:10] temptation.
[1:17:13] Don't don't think that it is finished.
[1:17:16] That's right.
[1:17:19] Hallelujah. The Bible said that they
[1:17:22] shall endure to the end.
[1:17:25] So long the end has not come, you can be
[1:17:28] entering into diverse temptations. You
[1:17:32] see, it is the Bible put it diverse.
[1:17:34] Yes. But what I believe
[1:17:38] is that the God that delivered me from
[1:17:41] the first temptation, he will deliver me
[1:17:43] from the second temptation. He will
[1:17:45] deliver me from the third temptation.
[1:17:47] Any temptation that the enemy put me in,
[1:17:49] the Lord will deliver me out of it.
[1:17:52] Because I am under the shadow of the
[1:17:54] almighty. Glory.
[1:17:57] True. Where the brother was transferred
[1:17:59] was worse than the previous place.
[1:18:05] In that same
[1:18:06] place, they came around. You see the
[1:18:09] moment they
[1:18:10] see we call them
[1:18:13] C that is criminal investigation
[1:18:17] department they go in for the
[1:18:20] criminals. So if anyone of such people
[1:18:23] are transferred to those towns the
[1:18:26] criminals always want to affiliate with
[1:18:29] him so that they can go on with their
[1:18:32] with their with their criminalities.
[1:18:34] Yeah. So quickly they want to come
[1:18:36] around. Oh, bra, take this money. Oh,
[1:18:39] this take this money. And they'll be
[1:18:41] giving you food. They'll be giving you I
[1:18:43] mean a whole lot of things. Sheep, even
[1:18:44] cows, they'll come and give it to you.
[1:18:48] But this brother refused every bit of
[1:18:50] it, even at the place that he was
[1:18:52] transferred
[1:18:54] to. And you know what? When they
[1:18:58] tried and they were not able to do
[1:19:01] that,
[1:19:02] then they hired some women
[1:19:08] to go and put him
[1:19:12] down. You understand what I mean? Yeah.
[1:19:15] In fact, various types of women Yeah.
[1:19:18] the tall, the short, the fat ones, and
[1:19:22] the slim ones, the black ones, the
[1:19:25] yellow ones. I mean a the different
[1:19:27] kinds. He said, "Pastor, I see that they
[1:19:31] were pushing the women to come and tempt
[1:19:33] me, but I stood on my foot because I
[1:19:37] know that I'm a child of God." Amen. And
[1:19:40] they couldn't do anything of that
[1:19:42] nature.
[1:19:43] And one day, he said he was at the
[1:19:47] office when a young man entered into the
[1:19:51] office. So I'm looking for uh officer so
[1:19:54] so and so. He said oh yeah he's in. Then
[1:19:58] he was invited
[1:20:00] in. When he was looking for the brother
[1:20:03] the brother went to look at the he
[1:20:05] doesn't know him
[1:20:07] anywhere and the man said sir h please I
[1:20:13] am here to to talk to you. He said go
[1:20:16] ahead.
[1:20:17] The first question he asked him brother
[1:20:20] Ray was that what idol do you worship?
[1:20:27] What
[1:20:30] idol? I am a Christian. That was the
[1:20:32] brother said I'm a Christian. I don't
[1:20:33] worship
[1:20:35] idols. He says sir please I I want you
[1:20:38] to be sincere with
[1:20:40] me. I want to make I want you to make me
[1:20:43] your friend. That is why I came to ask
[1:20:47] you this please. I want to know the type
[1:20:51] of idol you
[1:20:53] worship. Brother said well if you want
[1:20:56] still to know the idol that I worship
[1:20:59] then honestly I don't have any idol. The
[1:21:02] only thing I worship is Jesus Christ in
[1:21:05] the message of the hour. Hallelujah. And
[1:21:08] that was what the brother said.
[1:21:11] Then the man open
[1:21:14] up. He
[1:21:16] said, "Sir, I am here for a
[1:21:21] purpose. I am a witch
[1:21:25] doctor. And I have so many witches. I
[1:21:28] have so many idols that I worship." He
[1:21:31] said, "I inherited it from my own
[1:21:34] dad. And some elders of this
[1:21:38] town have asked me to kill you. Wow.
[1:21:44] And this idols I have used it to kill a
[1:21:46] lot of
[1:21:48] people but I have tried it on
[1:21:52] you on several
[1:21:55] occasions but anytime I tried I don't
[1:21:58] get you.
[1:22:00] He said anytime I tried I don't get you.
[1:22:04] So I become so confused. I don't know.
[1:22:06] That is why I'm here to find out. Maybe
[1:22:08] you have some idols that is power than
[1:22:10] mine.
[1:22:13] Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] The brother said, "Praise God."
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:22] Hallelujah. Then he remembered that
[1:22:25] scripture. He that abideth under the
[1:22:28] shadow of the Almighty.
[1:22:30] Hallelujah. You are secured. Amen. No
[1:22:34] cost for any alarm. No matter what the
[1:22:37] devil do, no matter what artillery they
[1:22:40] will aim on you, it will not materialize
[1:22:44] because you have your security. Amen.
[1:22:48] You are at a safety position. Oh

[1:22:56] so that we close? Okay. Amen. Leviticus

[1:23:03] 25, we are closing with that scripture.
[1:23:10] Amen. Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 18
[1:23:15] and 19. He
[1:23:19] said, he said, "Wherefore ye shall do my
[1:23:23] status and keep my judgments and do
[1:23:26] them, and yet shall dwell in the land in
[1:23:30] safety. And the land shall yield her
[1:23:32] fruit, and yeah shall eat your field,
[1:23:34] and dwell therein in
[1:23:37] safety." Praise be the name of our God.

[1:23:41] will of God by accepting what God have
[1:23:45] given us in this our time without
