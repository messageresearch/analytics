taken place and to see that they regard that as their country and water and what a reality that though they have been living in other places and and you know some of them there you know maybe they were born there but then when it strikes to go back home and you know there's something that's a reality no matter where that your background your nationality ethnicity whatever it is when God deals with your heart it's a call from the homeland and that call from the homeland supersedes any nationality or anything of this earth because it is Christ himself gathering unto himself all of that seed that he has sown in every nation kindred and tongue and we're just here just for a small space of time we are Pilgrims and strangers amen we're looking forward to it aren't we we we have everything in

microphone that's yielded Lord that you might speak Lord and minister to the hearts Lord and God may our hearts be captured Lord in your presence Lord O God may you have your way father Lord this morning Lord we love you we commit ourselves to you Lord once again for your glory we ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you will let's turn to turn together to the book of Philemon and in the book of Philemon I'd like to just speak from there this morning the Lord will help us we'll just read a few verses of Scripture as we before we let you have your seats chaplain just verse 1 Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother unto Philemon our our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and to our beloved Afiya and archippus our fellow soldier and to the church in thy house grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ amen may God bless the reading of his word as you're being seated when you look here at this letter and you know when you no doubt maybe this morning this would be the first time maybe that maybe some have read it and others maybe won't have this reference but when we look here in the letters that Paul had wrote so many of the letters that he wrote were those which were wrote when Paul himself was in prison it wasn't suitable conditions it was very hard and destitute he didn't have it even in prison the way that things would be that we can somehow have insight to today but yet you'll find within it that it it nonetheless is an epistle and if you'll notice within each heading that you find you'll find this is the Epistle of Paul to the Saints and kalasa the Epistle of Paul to the Saints and Thessalonica and on and on the this is the Epistle of Paul to the Saints and in Philip and Philip I and you find this and yet within this very epistle here if we can say it in this manner this epistle would be like an audio letter it would be like a personal interview this particular epistle is an actual letter to the man by the name of Philemon and it is a personal letter that Paul has wrote that is also to be delivered and is delivered at the same time that the letter of that which is given to the Colossians and when we look here in in the scripture in the epistle itself you know you'll find in the different epistles because as I said there are epistles that Paul he wrote many of them he wrote him from prison the Ephesian and that that epistle he was in prison when you look at that of the colossians as we mention here he's in prison when you look at 2nd timothy he's in prison when you look at many of them he's in prison and when you look at those it whistles you will find them where Paul would write of needs that he would see within the church were in that fellow laborers and fellow workers would communicate to him different things that were trying to come into the church and yet Paul under the leadership of the Holy Spirit would be able to address those things as well as be able to speak you know and mention things to Titus and to Timothy especially in second Timothy where he would deal with the order and how things itself were to not only be within the church but he would go in at different times and speak of the order among the people and to see that these many of these things that were written it is it is so much of a help the epistles that were written these letters but when I look at this letter here the difference with this epistle that is so much different than the rest of them this epistle itself though with just you know when is it 20 20 some scriptures within it but yet it is a whole comprising of the actual gospel of Jesus Christ and when you think of this here you know the gospel we can go through and we can lay this scripture out and you know God would direct us to lay this out to help somebody and to encourage us and maybe take this direction but you know I think that we're in agreement here this morning that there's no greater epistle than an epistle itself that is actually reflected in the flesh and in the body of Jesus Christ so when we look at this I'd like to speak on a living epistle of Jesus Christ and yet Paul Paul begins here in 2nd Corinthians 3:1 he asked the people do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart Paul is is very clearly setting forth that the work that is done within the believers life itself is a testimony of the working of Jesus Christ through the ministry and it's what Jesus Christ Himself has brought forth in the lives of the people so much so that the lives of the people it's where their own lives are actually have been wrote and they are actually read by others you know it's things within of a Christian that for us as Christians it should not be that it would be that we have to announce that we're a Christian there ought to be a presence about our life that says or a Christian it ought to be a presence that separates us because truly it is the presence of God that separates us from the rest of the people throughout those throughout the rest of the earth you know there's things that people can do that's strange and that's odd they think you're strange they think we're odd and because there's certain things that we will do or we will not do but yet within it when we're truly from my heart it's not things that we're doing to make ourselves odd or to make ourselves stand out the real truth is we are of another Kingdom we were once walking here within this earth this world we still here we are but yet how God has touched our hearts and we reflect a different Kingdom although here we are as Americans or whatever nationality and background you are but yet when the Holy Spirit has moved upon our life and brought forth by the new birth that seed that's been quickened on the inside we now have become Express delegates of the Kingdom of Almighty God and then we truly are Pilgrims and strangers this world in itself we realize we're passing through this world if time itself will continue on no matter what age we are if God Terry's will have to go by the way of the gray as we sang here this morning I believe he's coming back like you said we truly see signs we see all of these things around this it is an opportunity think about it our lives that we have that God has given us is an opportunity that we might come into a place to accept him and that his life might be expressed in us God has a purpose for our life a purpose of our life is not that we would you know live and work and accumulate a lot of things that's not the purpose because to think of it after we are gone then the whoever else is family friends and whatever more fight over and everything else but after we when we are finished in this life we want it to be known that within this life what is left behind there has been a believer here there has been a Christian to realize that's the greatest heritage you could give your family you can have money till it's coming out your ears but yet if there can be a heritage of eternal life a heritage where there has been a Christian where through your life Christ has been able to touch the lives of others that is the greatest treasure that can ever be upon this earth so to look at this a written epistle because what Paul it will write here is not going to be good flowery words it is not going to be something that Paul would just you know express that he himself is not an expression of and you know when you think of that there's one word that you and I would really call to mine when someone says something that they truly don't live and Express you would call that a hypocrite is that right you would call that Allah it's not truthful so when you think of it how many people that you are I run across and you can ask them and they'll say well yeah I love God yeah yeah you know I love Jesus and they'll say that but what it is there's certain things about him that they love but yet they really don't love him if they love him they surrender their life to him and it will show itself no matter where you're at it will show that you yourself are actually in love with him now watch this in the message life let me read a few places to you here brother rambles on he says you know life is what controls us we are known by the life that we live and it's been said that your life speaks so loud that I can't hear your testimony so therefore to live a sermon would much wouldn't would be much better than to preach one the life you live shows what character you are because your life always builds your character Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them so no matter what we would say or how many how much we would testify if our lives doesn't coincide with the testimony we are doing the kingdom of God and in debt meant by giving that testimony because people know what we are Liu bang goes on to say this here and I'd say that no doubt many of us have been in these situations I have often thought of a funeral service to hear a man preach the funeral of some person that had lived ungodly and had never done anything right and yet preaches though they were a great person that had gone right on to heaven no matter what you ever say the people already has their minds made up by the life that character has left behind and he said I think that of longfellow right here when he said partings leave behind his footprints on the sands of time that's the Psalms of life now brother Graham goes on here in in hidden life with Christ he said you know the best thing is to live a sermon instead of preach one you know that your written epistle and you can't do it in yourself you can impersonate it for a little while but your sins will find you out that's true isn't it you cannot live this the Christian life it's not something that you are I come to and say I'm gonna lay hold on it and I'm gonna live it you can't live it it has to be him live it through you there are wonderful principles within God's Word that even sitting under that word hearing that word that you can live to a level of sanctification where it'll actually preserve you from a lot of harm but yet there's still that struggle that's there and it's not a real true expression of Jesus Christ you see the life that was within the Lord Jesus remember here he himself was the fulfillment of the Old Testament but out of the old testament once that is fulfilled the life that was in Jeremiah Isaiah so forth on down remember through and by the giving of his life the shedding of his blood then would come forth the life that was within that blood cell that the very New Testament might be written and the New Testament is not words out here and a life over here but the New Testament itself is the very life of Jesus Christ now that the body was received back up to the minute Oriole seed of God as a witness and a testimony and then to send down the Holy Spirit that same life what does it do it actually writes and expresses that same life in the actions and everything of the believer so it is a New Testament now look he says you can't do it in yourself you can impersonate it for a little while but your sins will find you out you better just consecrate yourself to God and get on the inside shut the doors behind you and burn every barrier there is behind you in every bridge and launch out it's like a person says well I'm gonna wait for God to take it really I know it has to be God to take it but the point is are you ready to die if you're not ready to die God will never force fully take anything he wants to be our Lord he wants us to surrender our lives to him he does not know the real reality of Christianity it's not a dictatorship it's not where we serve Him under fear that is not it at all but it's actually where the love of God is made manifest that captures our heart to word that what we do we do because we love the Lord it doesn't matter where we're at we reflect that that we love the Lord Jesus Christ now look at this he goes on to say he says to burn every barrier that is behind you every bridge and launch out I know it's the truth I know it'll work if it hadn't been for that I don't know what would have become of me now he says but it ain't the people you look at then it's Christ in the message so brother BAM says when man see you living like him when he sees your character and your conduct with the word just exact like he was the word being manifested then man will see Jesus Christ they won't have to look around anywhere else what does this creep teach and what does that pre teach they'll know what God is when they see you in the Hebrews chapter 1 part 2 notice or chapter 2 part 1 he speaks of how Elijah and the fire falling there on the mountain and he says God always bears witness your life will bear witness I don't know what your testimony is but your life speaks so loud your voice can't be heard you're living your everyday life will testify what you are God bears witness your everyday live will testify what you are so a person a every one of us know right now and this is not putting anybody down but you you every one of us know people whether its family or whether it's people you work with they testify being a Christian but yet all it is is something they put on and when after service is over they've done their religion for the week and it shows it's religion they hang it up there's no power in their life there's no love affair to live for him in the face of all persecution in the face of what's taking place on the job there is no love affair it is no more than just religion and I'll say it very clearly God did not come to bring religion to you and I he does not matter of fact God hates religion he does not love religion as I told a man one time you know the man was an atheist and I said I'll tell you right now religion is not of God religion is man-made it is man I said you know I've wanted to the man I said look you tell me within this of religion you know people that have said certain things they've mentioned this and mentioned that and then look at the life that they live you mean to tell me that God does that and God produces that and the man you know was just standing there just startled and I said but sir I want to tell you now this was something that the Lord moved down with in that place and I said sir I want to tell you something you asked me how that my life had been changed and how different things had taken place I said sir that same pillar fire that same Lord God that's mentioned there in the scriptures that same God came down and did a work in my life it was nothing I had to quit it's what he himself came in and dead and there is a love affair of the Living God I said as a matter of fact I said you've heard of joke haven't you he said yeah I've heard you know something to that matter I said well let me tell you something that same God that was veiled in that whirlwind it's right here standing in this lobby right now I never would have said that if I couldn't have felt his presence but his presence came in and that man he just humbled all around he left his book he left his coffee mug I had to run out of the place and give it back to him said hey here's your book here's your coffee mug the presence of God had come there in such a way you see friends theology itself it's never by theologians of the Lord as a matter of fact brother man tells us in Christ the mystery it is not government it is not the government of Christianity that we make converts by do this don't do that do this don't do that that can produce good moral people which thank God for but it is not that which produces the new birth I'm afraid so many times people live in a level of sanctification and they've never been born again they look at and say well I used to do this and I used to do that and I don't do it no more but yet they have no love affair with the Lord outside of church you know the word itself outside of church there's no life there's no prayer life there's no giving them themselves to the Lord I hate to say it but it don't look like there's a real experience there at all because when there's a real experience with God how in the world can you stay away from him how can you stay away from prayer how can you stay away from the word how can you stay away from church with so flimsy little excuses how can you do that and when Christ himself would be alive in your life I'll tell you brother and sister we need to go deeper it's got to be a deeper life now look at this here there is one thing that how then it would be mentioned within our lives a seal that would show coming and going so I believe within our hearts as believers though the real desire that would Paul say to emanate from our hearts we want to see Jesus Christ reflected in our lives I mean I've never I've never known you know a woman she might have married the ugliest guy in the world but you know what she wants that baby to look like him there'd be characteristics what it tells who she's been with are you with me it bears those reflections and that's exactly where the desire within our heart gets not asked that we want to see glorified we want to see him glorified we want to see him exalted him lifted up you know it's those things that we thank God for testimonies thank God for moving on the scene healing the six transforming lives and to see that reflection in our lives you realize sometimes there's people at work they'll never themselves witness that of the healing or a miracle but yet there is a presence about your life that is becoming to listen to me like it was in Luke 15 one where those of the sinners actually came near to Jesus so Jesus did not have the Spirit of God in him was not an all of life I'm holier than you you cannot come near me you might pollute me that was not the order of the Spirit of God in his life as a matter of fact it was a car quite the contrary the reality in his life is what drew sinners and publicans they came to hear him I'll tell you right now that's the greatest thing that's the greatest drawing card is a life that's lived sometimes you can't even get any inroads with anybody until a life has been lived there's got to be a life that's been lived the presence of the Living God it's gone forth from our life now think of this here Paul would speak in Philippians 3:10 let me just refer to these verses real quick in verse 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead it's a faithful saying Paul would ruin Paul would speak up in another place a faithful saying if we do not reign with him if we do not suffer with him we will not reign with him see to suffer it's entering in to his suffering not just the sufferings we go through but to actually be made a partaker of that vicarious suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ by that of the new birth where we and ourselves are made partakers of that life and this is what Paul is expressing here now it's very much like that of a marriage so when we see it if we don't suffer with him we will not reign with him there had to be suffering as we looked at last week there had to be a submissive life a life that even in the midst of tests and trials that it was submitted fully to Almighty God now look at this you know when we think of it in even in our own lives and to see how that we need the grace of God to go through tests and trials there's not one of us here that would actually ask and say I need a test I need a trial there's not one of us that would ask that because we realize that tests and trials they are appointed of God even that of persecutions and reproaches and how the many different various ways that it will come you realize that there is a time that for a person when God can deal with their life for the young or whether old and it comes to a place that they wonder how am I going to face people on the job how am I going to face my family you see what stands out to them they realize if I submit and surrender to this what is my family going to think what is my co-workers gonna think they're looking at it and they're saying how is this gonna happen but you see when it can come to a place that by God's grace that that individual is able to look beyond all the persecution look beyond all the reproach and although what if I do this or how do I do this or how do I do that when they're able to look beyond that and come to such a place to where it is the love of God being projected and they're taking that in it becomes to a place that the persecutions and reproaches no longer make a difference they themselves are being swept away anybody got a witness in here this morning where it moves in your heart like that to where it no longer the focus is reproach the focus is no longer persecution but it actually becomes on serving the Lord it doesn't matter what it's going to cost us we our desire is to serve Him now to think of this even within trials here we need His grace we need it as we said last week when Paul said I will glory in my infirmities you do you realize within it glory in the infirmities within itself you know it's how that God will continue to teach us and direct us and help us that we might be christ-like in suffering and how that to be able to submit ourselves to subject to that test or trial knowing that God is molding and he's making us in our life now when you you think of this here you know blurring in our infirmities as we've looked at it it deals with how that God Himself you know with through the midst of the time and isn't of how much scripture we can quote it isn't how many quotes we can quote you know and with the way that I look at it is that you might say what does it say me this is you okay maybe it is me but when I look at it that somebody would text me or call me and they say brother Samuel I'm praying for you I don't need to return around and show my spirituality and quote scriptures and quote quotes to man the only thing I can do and the greatest thing is say thank you I appreciate that because you know what I'm in need I need that prayer if God put my name upon your heart thank God hold me up in prayer you don't know what that need might be here might be something to where that is being looked at right here in the world and I'm looking to God what direction do I go with this Lord how how do I move within this sometimes it'll be a pause for day we don't know what that is but the greatest thing that we can do friends is be able to just say thank you go ever tried to encourage some people and you try to encourage them and you realize oh that's what that thing again mm ah the only one that's experienced that sometimes you know you with a person you know where you know something has happened one time I never forget with an individual you know a person that had happened and you know you know where it's something had where there was one who had lost you know there have been a miscarriage within I think a month or whatever more and you know within that time you know it's my wife or what does she spoke up and she said I all she said but you know what she said God he is so faithful now the person we smoked right back at that time and said how would you know how would you know huh because we experienced it we experienced that but whether we experienced it or not God is faithful you understand what I'm saying it's to make ourselves in a way say God help me I I know friends listen to me God's not interested in us being cookie cutter carbon copies I understand we are all made up differently I understand that but I want to be me personally I want to be in such a place I can say thank you and just receive it as from the Lord I don't need you to give me certifications and say let me go down to the file cabinet and let me prove to you I've been through this and then sometimes people wonder well why don't people come and encourage me I wonder I know this is simple but we need His grace remember how brother Branham here he was he was speaking you know to the Lord and remember the Lord spoke to him about his trials and said are you trying to bypass him he said oh Lord no Lord take me through he would say in another place the Lord don't take the tests and trials from me but give me your grace to go through him there's the purpose within it all of the tests and all the trial there is a great purpose within it and he himself he promised he will be our escape he will be our refuge he will be our help our strength to be able to endure it the Bible says he will not allow a temptation to come our way but what he himself will make a way of escape that we might be able to bear it to endure it he makes a way so that he permits the tester trial and then he gives the strength but you and I might be able to escape to bear it in the midst of that time the escaping of it isn't always getting isn't getting out of it but God can provide some refreshment in the meantime he can provide some palm trees or Lord to rise up that'll give you some refreshment there now to think of this you know through the midst of it when we come back here to this scripture in the opening of our text in Philemon and look at how that hid this the scripture is recorded Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ you know what a person will say well also many times speak and tell of their thought life what they're thinking on what their dwelling on how is it when we you know maybe would get together in certain things you know that could be shared certain things that we're meditating on when we might begin to fellowship about the word and there's certain things maybe we've been meditating on and just you know putting before the Lord things that we've been thinking on now when you think of this Paul in listen here Paul himself wrote very much about the fault line of how that were to you know our thoughts think on these things and he would write bringing every thought into captivity Paul would write of that but to think of it Paul was not writing those things from an ivory tower he was writing it with rats around him he was writing that were there you know was just a stench in that sail to where he's tied up and yet in the midst of it Paul would admonish how is he able to do this he knew it by experience not to think of that by that experience that Paul went through he was able to submit himself how could he do this he was receiving from the Lord even in this time that he might be able to give back and encourage your eye that was not Paul the man doing that but God had allowed the circumstances to be as it were that Paul himself could actually now with the sympathy of Christ pouring through his life being able to minister to the rest of the saints of the Living God I'll tell you right now it'd be hard for you and I to have a lot of confidence if Paul was one of those ivory tower sitters you don't know how it is a lot of times in your workplace you got people than live up there and they walk in the carpets you know they drink the high dollar coffee and everything else and yet they make all of the decisions for you to do certain things never live the day on the floor never work today but yet they've got the ultimate solution to how to fix the problems add another creamer and another sugar and that should make everything fine but do you understand here is Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ he does not say Paul a prisoner of Rome do you know what he recognizes I'm not here as a prisoner roll Paul had wrote in the very first chapter to the Romans I desire to come to you but many times I've been hindered but then when Paul would stand there before Felix how the Holy Spirit told him said Paul you are going to go and testify in Rome as you've testified in Jerusalem Paul realized that what had taken place his circumstances he was testifying I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ I find it you know when you look at Paul or John on the Isle of Patmos try to find out a lot of stuff about the howl of hammers try to find out a lot matter of fact after that phrases mentioned in the Book of Revelations try to find it again John could have chose to be absorbed in the hardships of the Isle of Patmos just like me and you and sometimes you know what thank god we've got encouragement I said thank god we've got encouragement because we're not always hitting out of ten and we've got encouragement encourage for what why would God give you a help mate to help you to encourage you in what in the face of Almighty God to be an encouragement to you not to be littler but an encouragement in the things of Almighty God now to think of this here Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ you know when we look at it here Paul here he was undoubtedly Paul now listen to me these are not just words that said like you or me going to somebody that's it and then they all of a sudden they rattle out you know scriptures and and quotes and everything else and they've got everything put together and that's not what Paul was doing here you understand this was not pride coming out here where you know I'm going to show that I've got a lot and this was not what this was and please don't misunderstand me in quotes the scriptures are they come to me as well but yet within it here to understand that Paul is not just putting something a play on words this is a reality of where Paul is resting how can he do this it is not the DNA of Paul he told us in other places he had experienced fears within and without Paul never wrote this that he would be exalted but how is this how does this come about is because Paul in the midst of his test or trial this is a huge key he stayed in fellowship with Jesus Christ it's one thing for us to be in him and dwell in him but remember Paul also wrote to the Galatians saying it twice in the same chapter if ye in the spirit walk also in the spirit giving our lives over to him even as Jude would admonish us building ourselves up in that most holy faith keeping yourself in the love of God to to think how that Paul himself what's Paul doing by staying in fellowship the same thing for you and I by staying in prayer with God and staying in fellowship with other believers now let me just put a little caveat here staying in fellowship with believers it's not calling somebody up and telling them all your problems and all your troubles sometimes that's what people call prayer that's not called prayer that's called complaining and you'll never receive strength through complaining but if somebody's on the other end listen they can help us they can say you know what but God is faithful I'll tell you what you have to do within this you just don't have to take this to God in prayer and you know got in then God will you know maybe give something that will help them or encourage them because to tell you the truth friends we all have been there one time or another and then not just once sometimes we frequent in that place I know that's something we oh I don't want I don't want to admit that no but the reality is their humanity shows itself the frailty of the vessels you know many times I've been around people who are sick right here in this assembly you would come in and you know as your your you're ministering to that MA so many times I leave out of there I'm encouraged man I'm strengthened I thought you know Here I am to go to try to you know Lord is there anything I can say anything you know I can do just be an encouragement sometimes you realize it's just actually going and being there but then many times I'll be things that will actually be refreshing or things that they would say and then you might hear you know the little setback that'll come their way and maybe you know they would get a little down or discouraged but you know a child of God cannot say down or stay discouraged very long how can you keep them down or discouraged when they've got resurrection power on the inside the party raised us up we might get down we might get discouraged but there is resurrection power on the inside the holy be to God so Paul has he's able to receive from the Lord look Paul Jin just right come before that we're he's a half reached that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities Paul did not write that and send that out there among the church just as a good writing it was a reality he knew that you realize many times when you're listening to the message there's things now over the past years I listen to it there's ways and certain things a brother man will say that I can look and say he's experienced that it just might be a little phrase of something but you go into it and say he's experienced it because you'll find things that where he'll be directed by the Spirit of God to tell us how to battle certain things with the enemy and you know what you don't get that by reading you don't get that by reading we understand of Ephesians 6 putting on the home of God but it's also by the application and the experience with it and sometimes our experience with it we miss some fiery darts but with that experience it helps us so that we can catch other fiery darts go over to be to God you're nothing oh my let's keep moving here notice how Paul he would make this appeal to to Philemon he would make this appeal to him I want you to just look at this here because we're talking about an epistle a living epistle of Jesus Christ not only was Paul's life and expression but let's look here that fill a man's life here and look at how that it's wrote Paul says I thank my god making mention of the always in my prayers hearing of thy love and faith which thou has toward the Lord Jesus and toward All Saints so it wasn't just a love and a faith that was toward the Lord Jesus but he also heard of this brothers faith that it was his love and faith was not only expressed toward the Lord Jesus but it was also to all the saints there is commendation that is going forth here notice in verse 6 that the communication of that faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by the brother how many of you like to be refreshed ok about five ten of you how many of you want to be a refreshing station you want to be a place to where someone knows that I can go and be refreshed I mean there's certain places that are in your house that you can go and be refreshed right so there's certain parts watch how this is mentioned here he's mentioned of the expression of the love and faith and then he's also spoke of the great joy and comfort that's consolation in thy love because the boughs the boughs themselves being bad like we've looked at this many times of the spleen or that of that inward part of the tender affections the kindness the beloved of benevolence that would be there with the people of God so to think about this here with with with Philemon of how that within his lot there was such a testimony that was before the Saints it was not just a testimony that's a good moral man man-bat brother can quote the word that was not the testimony he expressed the love and faith of Jesus Christ in other words the life was lived so the life itself an epistle that was actually expressed not to think of this here of how that Paul you can you know when you see this of how that Paul would make mention that the people of God were actually refreshed by this man how could the people of God be refreshed by him it's evident was it that was it that you know Philemon wasn't that he didn't have trials he did have trials was it that he did not have problems he did have problems even one that will go into and read about but what was the secret he was in contact with the high priest and he was connected so that that sympathy think about it he will even this would not have been the testimony if his life was filled with bitterness but his life was so silver flowing with love and faith friends listen this was not something that you to look at today or me and say oh Lord that that's just unattainable no it is attainable to us as believers put on therefore has the holy elect beloved of God bowels of mercies seek in to submit to it and recognize this is not something we just pick up or it's something just kicks in in our life but remember may we be so anointed with his spirit that it will pour over from our lives to be ministers of his presence the innermost part of the people were refreshed I don't know how it is with you but there's been times I I mean really I've been refreshed sometimes you know in places and times you know even even sometimes in ministry I know it seems odd and strange you wouldn't understand it maybe if you as a minister even sometimes as a pastor but the refreshment at times is a very is a very welcoming thing and when you are refreshed sometimes even as we would fellowship together I want to be refreshed you know what I mean a lot to be refreshed I like to be encouraged I like you know I that's that's a desire to where when you leave fellowship you don't say huh you understand you'd ought to be Battleship refreshment one to another let me move on from that it ought to be that of encouragement no wonder that Paul would go on to admonish us as believers in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us uh-oh consider one another that means think about to give mine to let every man the land on every man look on his own things but also on the things of others let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works how do you provoke unto love and good works not by words not by words by a life a life that's lift a life that's effectually expressed so how can this be if we're not in contact with one another hello somebody how can this be if we're not in contact with one another but saying I pray in my prayer closet wonderful so do i but how can this be if we're not in contact one another I'm not talking about where we gotta be to be one another's best buddies and best friends and always getting together for coffee that's not what I'm talking about we miss the simplicity of the gospel here not forsaking the Assembly of ourselves together you know you could sit down and tell somebody this is the right thing to do do this do this do this do this do this do this you let me know how often they're gonna come and seek your company out what brother Samuel you know the word is corrective I know but sometimes it's not the word that's corrective it's your attitude that's offensive it's not anything about the word people were not offended by the word it was by the attitude Oh God we want to represent you know the reality is let them see that it's a life let's encourage one another let it be an expression of life on a pistol that's lived oh god help us not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is now I mentioned they had some of the same excuses we do today but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching now look at this in the message at that world a person who lives their life for their self lives a selfish life we must live for others bear you one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ we've got to have a feeling for one another and therefore when you do all that you know to do then when you lay down and night you have the consolation knowing that you tried your best I can't make everyone believe that's impossible Jesus couldn't do that when he was on earth and I know they'll be just a few that believes but if anything I can add to help the gospel that's my duty of being here is to try to help somebody along the way uniting time ensign he says a man Jesus Christ in the form of a pillar of fire that he was in the Old Testament he was when he met Saul on the road down there to Damascus the Saint Jesus here today and what does it do does it bring fear it brings love a uniting of one another very men a feeling for one another it brings the love of God o uniting us and bring us the body of Christ into unity as a bride that's what it's doing now this great union with God that's what it's doing it how within our lives the love of God it moves it even moves for those and saying God help them Lord may they come into this life Lord help them Lord God but they would recognize it's not a do's and dont's it is a life it is the very person of Jesus Christ that they need to meet Lord God help them Lord God you realize this we we understand this right here it's not speaking of church being a Country Club where it's a feel-good we come here to be edified and encouraged and part of the edification is when he also cuts us down because he's removing from us what would be a great hindrance to our lives when he disciplines and corrects us but the heart to be has its place such a love of feeling for one another it ceasing to feel for somebody if they're right on the same track as you and what I find is odd sometimes people have more feeling for people who don't even come to church than for people that come to church with something wrong with that Holy Ghost something's wrong somewhere well the same as they've sent no they note or they'd this or they've that but what about within the life who can have compassion who can have a life to pray for that individual to pray for them and maybe to contact them you know friends these things are very simple I understand but they're so important to our lives but you realize this is not something that even within itself I believe the Spirit of God my desire was so stir our hearts within these things that has that you know with with Philemon when he came there among the people of God they were actually refreshed as he came among them look at this in verse eight now Paul's getting into the matter of the business wherefore though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin which means to command thee that which is convenient or fitting yet for love's sake I rather beseech or Mohnish thee being such an one as Paul the age and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ look how Paul is placing this once again Paul the aged and a prisoner of Jesus Christ I beseech thee for my son O'Neal only Simas whom I have begotten in my bonds Wow Anisa mmus was a slave servant of Philemon he had run away he had escaped he had taken money and noticed when Paul writes this he doesn't say thy servant Aneesa mmus he says my son Aneesa miss her glory there was something that took place that Paul was able to witness he could have said that servant but you see there had been a change all glory be to God you realize that within this here hell that within it this this this man only Simas he could have been put to death for going back as that of Rome he could have been put to death for escaping and running away well I want you to see notice where we've come to and this Paul did not just pull right out and pull authority or pull rank and say take him back but he writes with compassion which in times past was to be unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me there's no doubt about it fillet menounos terms in times past he knew what times past meant in times past he was dead in sin and trespasses he knew in times past what to Smith but he at one time was unprofitable to you but now he's profitable truly any life without the Lord being the center of it there's wonderful things that can be done that's true but really a life itself without Christ being the center it never comes to the height of real true profitable nough son'll s it's inside of the Lord Jesus Christ a person might be ever so helpful to the community they might do all of those good things and whatever more but you know what it's a lot more than doing good and doing this and I give baskets to the poor it's about living a life that's surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ that he is reflected through our lives oh my you know when Paul would write this you know Paul was one when you you look how Paul would write in the book of Romans and other places Paul was quick to let people know you know when you walk into people's house sometimes you you know you sometimes you know when you maybe go in my mom's house and then my wife's my wife will have even pictures of me when we first started courting and things like that and you know almost look back at them picture now saying who in the world is that guy well my mom will have pictures of knowing I was a boy you know and then you look back on that in your thing lord have mercy and you know you changed since then right you can go back to that now you know within those pictures a picture itself is a moment whether maybe it's a moment where you're at some type of an event and you take a picture maybe your son or daughter is on the stage or grandchild or whatever and you snap that picture and they're just stepping up to the microphone that's their that is a moment that's been captured but if time terry's they themselves will no longer or they will grow beyond that moment in that picture they change in their looks maybe there's certain things that they change and certain things that you're praying that'll be changed and that actually gets changed in their life but what happens you've got a point or a photo or a point you can go back to and say this is where they were at this point but this is now who they are and you realize that what Paul is writing by the Spirit of God that yes that though Anissa mmus has done you wrong but remember don't keep that photograph don't keep him in a picture frame as though to try to hold him in bondage you know how Paul wrote without me laying in a lot more scriptures on this right here there's things friends that offenses and everything can come our way what matters is are we gonna hold people in picture frames you with me are we going to keep them in that same picture or are we going to allow and then allow the Spirit of God to move and allow God to work within their life and bring them around maybe they'll never come around but regardless we don't allow the picture frame to control our reference toward them glory be to God this is a real expression of the gospel oh my so to think of this here how that that Paul would go on here in verse 12 whom I have sinned again that thou therefore receive him that is mine own bounce receiving this is my heart this is my tender affection receive him listen now Paul is not in a comfortable living room he's not sitting in a lazy boy and has his latte on the side he's in a Roman Jail he's in a situation that is not comfortable oh god help us but he is not he is not allowed there of the walls of that of that prison - so taint him and the acids there to move within bitterness to where he will not even take notice of uneasiness she had to take notice of a nice famous to actually be able to lead him to the Lord he had to be you say how could that be it goes back to what the Lord's been bringing out in our life the secret is going and taking our burdens to him in prayer lord help me Lord God when the acids and things like that would want to pour down Lord God Lord Jesus let it be Lord the Holy Spirit just moving down Lord watering in my life Lord God help me Lord in this situation lord help my attitude Lord to be right Lord God wash me Lord Jesus this is what was taking place if not Paul would have said permissiveness you're on your own but I got my own set of problems you see this ching ching ching ching ching do you know what they've been doing to me how they're feeding me miss mills and how they're rats and this and then even in these times right here paul's chained to a soldier but you don't hear it do you hello now that's okay i know sometimes this stings but you say man it'll help your Paul would have had Instagram he wouldn't have been posting pictures of the soldier with her with an emoji I hope I got that right with a gnome emoji with teary eyes coming down Paul would not have been doing that it wasn't that Paul was superhuman he was that he stayed in contact with God that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings Mazal say it as it comes to me you know their studies they've done with things on Facebook and water for more and I know some of you have to have before your job I know there's requirements like that that has taken place but you know what they've even actually done all the studies and things like a and you find where people even within depression and people's moods they'll fire it up and they see certain posts going on and it'll affect them the rest of the day now let me ask you a question do you want somebody feel sorry for you or do you want the Lord to pour out of his spirit because if he pours out of his spirit I guarantee you right now he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and I guarantee you there's other believer priests that are in contact with him that he can drop your name right in their heart he may not drop my name in somebody's heart in Nigeria I don't know many of her brothers even though we're part of the same body of Jesus Christ but he will with the local body he'll drop it in my heart maybe other pastors or ministers that I'm associated with that is the confidence that we have in him what did Paul even come in the Church of the Living God in the opening there of 2nd Corinthians chapter one I believe it is where he would speak your prayers your prayers going forth on our behalf have comforted us and then even have Instagram Twitter and Facebook and texting and SMS and whatever more they didn't have all of that but they had a greater signal station like her brother Daryl say before at a camp they didn't have a TMT they had g.od hey man what a sending station that they received same thing you and I receive here today now look at this here whom I would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel Paul Paul you mean this man who was a slave who ran away you're allowing you mean he's ministering to you see Paul wrote about the body he wrote on the Ministry of the body and knew that every joint supplies he knew the movement of the Spirit of God of how that God could actually end it he even wrote it in Philippians and other places that it would actually minister back to him don't you see friends it's not just us going and minister and giving out giving out giving out it's also that there's to be of movement in the body there's one valve a chamber it goes out of the heart it sends out that blood but there's another intake valve if there's not an intake valve there's gonna be problems there's God it's got to be that circulating there of that very life that ministering one to another on one another's behalf verse 14 but without thy mind would I do nothing that that benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly what another principle of the gospel I don't want you to do it out of necessity I could have kept him here but I want it to be willingly I want it to be willingly this is the same desire we have the children have desire it's willingly not out of necessity we Minister different things of the system but yet the desire is willingly of art now to think of this what's this what if Paul would have just cut to the chase and this would have been a shorter epistle maybe one scripture receive an SMS no questions asked what if he'd have done it that way it may not have come out too good would it it wouldn't have been that no doubt that Philemon wouldn't wouldn't have you know he would I'm not gonna do that no but you see even within this Paul himself recognizes there's wrong that's been done that might still be stinging in the heart of Philemon maybe he's having to pray maybe the feelings maybe thoughts will come up and he's having to pray I hope you're with me Philemon wasn't walking around as a superhuman either where that all nor I got the love of God in my heart I never have any wrong thoughts towards anybody I never think wrong of uneasiness no no doubt he had to battle those thoughts but there's a burden he was able to battle him when he would try to encroach and come back up he was able to how did he battle it the same way Paul did staying in prayer in the love of God and pouring his heart and allowing his life to be refreshed sometimes friends all we do is dump the problems and we're not asking God Lord minister back to me and wiggled added prayer get up in prayer and feel the same way how can that be it's because all we're doing is pouring out our problems but the reality when we come before the throne of God remember here don't ever let the devil take that away from you there is a high priest that is touched by the feeling of your infirmities he can release and he does release virtue and strength to minister to you an hour in the time of need it doesn't mean when we get back up off our knees that our trial is gone our trouble is gone but we've received refreshment to be able to make another step then maybe by noon when you get ready for lunch things will start back up but there you can go right before the high threes you know what are you doing you are watching yourself in the presence of Almighty God this is where Paul would say in Romans 6 let not therefore sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof but yield your members as those that are alive from the dead the quickening soda recognize don't allow thoughts rain suggestions that come things that better said don't allow it to rain but instead just allow the refreshing of the Holy Spirit Lord my brother didn't mean that my sister didn't mean that now you're not gonna talk about my brother that way you're not gonna toggle you know you see it's allowing a refreshment the same is simple I know but if God will help us right now cross the mystery of God will be expressed this is this is why brother Branham would take such long time even before that message so tickle and fast-forward it too when he opens in Luke 24 you missed a key component you get this right it's like having the best gasoline in the world if you don't have a spark what good does it do if your pipes aren't clean what good does it do you see this is this is a key thing we are charged with this now boy listen listen to try to bring this now for perhaps verse 15 he therefore departed for season that thou should has received him for ever now not as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved especially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the Lord now let's go to Colossians chapter 4 because Paul's not just riding a letter here to Philemon but this letter that goes personally to Philemon was also accompanied with the Epistle to the caution church now the Costin Church they would have known Philemon record history and so forth says it has that perhaps that Philemon after heap a person different ones was the past or the one who was overseeing it they would have known on the CMAs now watch how Paul places this in Colossians for one masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven see Paul had to deal with this in the church so there was not one rising up over the other but to recognize we're sons and daughters of Abraham that's where it starts now watch verse seven all my estate South shall flashes declare unto you who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and a fellow servant in the Lord whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts with only Simas a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they shall make known unto you all things which are done here a slave let's run away he's been converted and there's obvious that the work of Christ in his life where Paul would count him in this passage of Scripture as a fellow laborer you see what the work of Jesus Christ does in a life it's him that raises that life and how Paul himself would write concerning him what Paul said was enough don't you be calling him a slave or a servant don't you be bringing up his past this is who he is to hold it be to God now think of this Paul goes on to say in Philemon verse 17 if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself if he have Rome V Oro with the art put that on mine account hi Paul look at this have written it with my own hand I will repay it howbeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even that own self besides an epistle of Jesus Christ brother emphasis sometimes I feel like the runaway slave when Paul found him he wrote back to his master and said put all that he owes put it upon my bill and I'll pay you when I come when I fake her Paul there that great Christian how that his heart knew that there was a great charge against him and Christ by his own blood wrote his pardon at the cross and took his place and he knowed how to feel for other people wouldn't it be wonderful if we all had that feeling this afternoon just take their faults and lay it on me but the tram goes home heals how many times with mr. Ballard in the flour company mr. Valli remember the man who comes to for a job he shows up with a pencil a no eraser mr. Ballard asked him said why don't your pencil have an eraser he said I don't make no mistakes he said you can leave because I can't use you a person who doesn't make mistakes doesn't work this is the principle of where love covers the multitude of sin are you with me it covers the multitude of sin it doesn't mean that it closed its eyes that which has been brought under the blood of Jesus Christ it's done you with me it's done not to be brought up anymore it's done now look at this his brother Graham would go on down through here let me just kind of go down to this place here bill dramas from my how that he's in that song go to go to paragraph five there he's talking about the song you know that he had that he had heard sung you know where if I fall if I follow if I fail let me rise and try again and he goes on he says I prayed that so much to God till I'm ashamed of myself almost let me rise and try again constantly falling in each time while he's been merciful to help me to come back again now if we just look over there isn't an hour through the day hardly but what's something we do that's wrong brother brems not talking about living a life that's not above sin that's not what we're talking about and now there's no little ones or big ones they're all big ones before God so if Apostle Paul had to die daily how much more will we have to die daily and then I think a person that has done something wrong and is willing to make it right the real Christian attitude is to forgive that person there's where I think brother Graham and the church people today miss us so much instead of trying to raise this person back up again is just to keep shoving them down further now you and I we understand we're not all more people say I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry because you know there are people who are sorry you understand there sorry you become the realized purges sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry but it really is it's not sorry they're just sorry they got caught they're sorry things aren't the way they want it to be that's not repentance that's sorrow of the world godly sorrow worketh repentance notice here he says that would be the the Gretna Christian thing to do to forgive that person the attitude and he goes on and says Christ when we were the lowest he stooped down and picked us up so that makes it to where we ought to have that kind of a spirit to brother and goes on to talk about the underneath Shem as he said I just can't call his name maybe some of you brethren can't I'm thinking of it how Paul he had caught a runaway slave and I can't think of what his name was but however he owed a great debt and Paul had been so into love with Christ let me put it this way Paul and Jesus were still sitting side by side holding hands riding down the road put it that way in other words Paul and Jesus Hatton got married and Jesus was over there by the door and Paul was over here they were still sweethearts they were still holding hands and you know just my because then that was reflected when it came to this situation till he sent word to the master that on the slave he's become a beloved brother all that he's done all that he owes you put it on my account and I'll pay it and when I come by Paul had been a Christian so long until he knew what it was to forgive what it meant to forgive somebody he had been forgiven himself and I think every Christian that's really been forgiven knows appreciations of forgiveness I don't know about you but there's things you know that you know I was talking some years ago you know with a brother named as a pastor much much older than myself and I was just there knowing and ministering in meetings with him this meetings and he was talking about a situation and the brother himself as he mentioned to it he said you know he said I've come to a place he said when somebody comes up to me and says my brother so-and-so he says will you forgive me he said I don't even eat so I tell him I don't want to know what it is you're forgiven what's the value of know what it is I forgive you you understand what is that it's to not allow the enemy to have any little nesting straws in our life I know you don't have to do that it's not doctrine but I look at anything my what a great advantage within that that for a person to come and say hey will you forgive me brother sister it's good it's done not yet I'll tell me all about it I said I was closing we're coming down there yeah brother verse 20 let me have joy of the in the Lord refresh my bowels in the Lord having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee what a compliment confidence unto thy obedience I wrote to you knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say let me end with this quote fellowship my Redemption the fellowship he said Paul had said the Fellowship of his suffering bearing persecutions with him Paul he was a man who had suffered with Christ when that slave over there had run away Paul had borne so much persecutions so many things of Christ to win that runaway slave runaway Paul wrote back to his master after the slave had become converted he said don't treat him as a slave anymore treat him as a brother Paul didn't say he's no longer a servant he said you treat him as a brother don't you treat him as a servant you treat him as a brother if he owes you anything charge it up to me when I come I'll pay you he had been so in fellowship with Christ in his suffering till he knowed what it was to be an outcast he said do you know what it is to be an outcast he knowed what it was to fellowship in his suffering so he knowed how to sympathise with others Paul had been fellowshipping with Christ these words so gripped my heart over the past weeks hear that through the tests and trials we when God first touched our life we did not know what tests or trials would befall us we did not know persecutions repro we didn't know all of that we didn't know things that we would suffer but yet through the midst of it by God's grace that the Lord helping us to where our lives would not become bitter not become bitter to wear it fill with malice resentment but to actually allow the Lord to minister to us friends listen those things themselves could easily set in on any of our lives easily this is why it takes staying constantly before the throne of God that the Lord would help us that he would give a strength because when this this whole part this epistle that we've ministered from today as Paul would go on to express you don't read one thing here in this epistle where Paul is bitter there's not one word and as a matter of fact Paul himself pours himself out interceding for Anissa --mess and gives such commending words to Philemon how how can he do that the same way by God's grace that were able to do it by the help of the Lord by his strength it would be natural and normal for a person to be bitter that would be a person can say aha I could see it under I can see I can see but yet in our lives by being refreshed from the Lord to be able to stand there and say the Lord is faithful and whether we say anything or not even where people can take a notice in our lives hardships things that come our way but that the presence of God ever remains that in itself is a living there's a living epistle to where others do not look at our lives and say I want the same hardships I want the same tests i but they look and they say that life that anchor that holds that's the same expression for homes in the church to one another lord help us help us support may this be so perfected in our lives that's my prayer my prayer when I've looked over this this morning looking over it again and again and again throughout the past weeks months looking Oh God let that love so saturate my heart I want more of that love I want more of that like the Prophet himself could say oh I wish you said I wish I could dwell in that all the time say Lord let it so saturate my life that it's so saturate my life to where it's not about me my problems but where I'm able to look they're going to be a help and encouragement let me tell you he cares for you this morning he is he is your refreshment miss pray or Jesus your God this letter received in the hand Philemon she would receive this letter a handwritten letter from Paul that would be addressed to him personally an epistle as the other epistles are regarded he would read an expression as it would be open Lord the commending the encouraging of how that he's been such an encouragement to the body but then Lord godwyn he would look up and his eyes would meet oniy Simas Lord God that by the grace of God the work that you had so done in Anissa misses life as Paul was able to surrender submit to you you were able to touch his life to where now uneasiness would be one who was profitable one who would be a help much more than just of that of a servant around his household but Annie CMAs would be a help a fellow laborer in the kingdom of God Lord help us sort there's so much Lord within it we see within our lives of how that Paul as you spoke to us Paul was able for his own life staying under that refreshment no doubt Paul had his times he was down times were he would have to battle but Paul would bring by the Spirit of God that body and subjection Paul would God would be able to write to that refreshment and then Lord God be able to help this runaway slave he would be able to loosen him from a bondage a servanthood that was much greater than what he escaped from he would be able by the love of God to project that love that would reach the very soul of a nice eNOS and set him free he would go back to Philemon more than the servant he would be a beloved brother one a faithful fellow laborer in the gospel Lord God we're witnesses of that transforming power witnesses Lord God here this morning Lord that right through this building right here that's gathered together maybe there's lots sitting here this morning undoubtedly Lord Lord God they realize there's something missing in their life Lord God your presence may be words that words it's not that they could understand words maybe but it's the presence of God that would touch their life that which is real that would be a reality Lord God that would touch their heart Lord or God may they give of themselves to you maybe Lord God repent of their sins maybe Lord God walk or Dean Salvation would never accept your Lord as their Savior Lord may be something that rise within their hearts to say I want that reality that presence that sealed a living written epistle I want to be identified with Jesus Christ granite Lord God this morning northers heather's Lord as we sit here Lord you know our needs Lord God you speak to us as we have need of it you encourage us what I pray this morning maybe there's one that's here going through the darkness of trial right now maybe it's been something that's just been lingering but just seemed like I just can't get over this maybe it's something Lord that in their life they they don't realize but maybe how events have turned out that instead of really taking that and really praying about it and really asking you to cleanse him it's become bitter [Music] lord I pray help her Lord be very easy Lord God for that to set in but Lord would you help him this morning I don't believe God that there's any person Lord that would sit here this morning that would want to be in bitterness no one would Lord I pray the Lord that you would move for them Lord may they Lord reach out to you Lord knowing Lord there's a cleansing full there's a refreshing Lord God not just Lord God in talking of the problem Lord I don't mean to say anything that was sting but to really evaluate and say Lord have I just been complaining to you or am I really casting my care upon you am I really Lord coming to you and asking you Lord Jesus maybe it's a hurt it's a wound it's an offence but in your life you realize supernaturally that's what it will have to be a supernatural touch of the Living God maybe a part in your life that just feels like you're just dead to it you need the power of the Resurrection to move God by his restoring power to move you'll move by his tenderness and by his sweetness if you can just reach out to him and say Lord come Lord sweep over my son sweep over my spirit Lord maybe you've become hardened do calloused maybe there's those things about your life that you would say Lord I forsake my rights to be hardened to be callous Lord God hello on my life to be hardened Lord I wanted to be tender Lord Jesus Lord God will you just Lord pour out of your refreshing Lord refresh my life that's what I need Lord I've been complaining way too much Lord that's not helping me but Lord you're my high priest who can be touched by the feeling of my infirmities Lord you spoke to us some weeks ago you know what it's not to be ignored you know what it's like to be persecuted you know what it's like in all of those areas you experienced it or Jesus I need strength from you I need a touch your God from You Lord Jesus or God in fellowship with you Lord God that you administer or God to my need Lord help me Lord help me I want to be an effectual believer priest [Music] or got a vessel that's available when you drop somebody that you can come by then Lord God is a vessel that's there that you can drop somebody on my heart and I can pray for him available Lord God to reach out in intercessory a life Lord God that maybe can bring right around here Lord in the church not here Lord God between his sword god from a heart we can minister on behalf of that soul as Paul would say I'll become all things to all men that I may win some to Christ help us Lord help a sword father we realize it'll take the grace of God we're living in an hour this is the time that Paul spoke of fearless times would come and that which is a sign of peerless times men shall be lovers of themselves or Jesus sword [Music] may our lives be an epistle like this an expression of the gospel of Jesus Christ help us avoid like Paul to be able to reach out there and say lay it on my account lay it on my account Lord sometimes there's things in jobs and places we work they say take one for the team sometimes that's a phrase that's used out there but to think how that Paul would come about it with Colossians 3 and he would say if anyone has a Korell forgive one another even as Christ forgave you what God help us to be simple help us to be silly help us to be so as your prophet put it in these statements so in fellowship with the love of Christ that that can reign in our lives help us Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] I had lead [Music] sports [Music]
