[30:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have nothing without him. Amen.
[30:20] I'm so thankful. Amen. [snorts] Where
[30:22] were you when he found you? Amen. Amen.
[30:25] Maybe out in the world, maybe in a
[30:27] church pew, but you were nothing without
[30:29] him. But when he came by, amen. And
[30:32] quicken that Jean seed in your heart to
[30:35] life. Oh my, what a day. Amen. And and
[30:39] it's just good to be in the house of the
[30:41] Lord. What a tremendous atmosphere of
[30:44] worship this evening. I thank you
[30:46] musicians. Thank you, brother Paul, for
[30:48] the music and just so enjoyed that
[30:50] worship and always do. Amen. And it's
[30:53] just good to be with you. Amen. We
[30:55] appreciate brother Samuel very much for
[30:57] the confidence, the opportunity to be
[30:59] here and we just pray the Lord bless
[31:01] him. Amen. Where he's at tonight and we
[31:04] just sure appreciate your pastor very
[31:06] much and feels just feels just like home
[31:09] away from home and so many familiar
[31:12] faces and brother Dave back there,
[31:14] brother Brian, all the friends and
[31:15] family. We just appreciate all of you so
[31:18] very much. Amen. If you have your
[31:21] Bibles, we'll turn straight to the word
[31:23] tonight in the book of Exodus, chapter
[31:26] 32.
[31:28] Let's pray the Lord give us grace. And
[31:31] may have a little bit of a
[31:34] some reading. So, we just pray that Lord
[31:38] will just pick it up and use it in some
[31:40] way. Amen. And we'll start in the verse
[31:44] 24
[31:46] and uh we'll we'll back around here a
[31:48] little bit after we read this. But it
[31:51] says, "And I said unto them, whosoever
[31:53] hath any gold, let them break it off. So
[31:56] they gave it me that I cast it into the
[31:58] fire, and there came out this calf. And
[32:01] when Moses saw that the people were
[32:03] naked, for Aaron had made them naked
[32:05] unto their shame among their enemies."
[32:07] Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp
[32:09] and said,"Who is on the Lord's side? Let
[32:13] him come unto me." And all the sons of
[32:15] Levi gathered themselves together unto
[32:17] him. And he said unto them, "Thus saith
[32:19] the Lord God of Israel, put every man
[32:22] his sword by his side, and go in and out
[32:25] from gate to gate throughout the camp,
[32:27] and slay every man his brother, and
[32:29] every man his companion, and every man
[32:31] his neighbor." And the children of Levi
[32:33] did according to the word of Moses. And
[32:35] there fell of the people that day about
[32:37] 3,000 men. For Moses had said,
[32:41] "Consecrate yourselves today to the
[32:43] Lord, even every man upon his son and
[32:46] upon his brother, that he may bestow
[32:48] upon you a blessing this day." And it
[32:50] came to pass on the tomorrow that Moses
[32:53] said unto the people, "Ye have sinned a
[32:55] great sin. And now I will go up unto the
[32:57] Lord, pervententure. I shall make an
[32:59] atonement for your sin." And Moses
[33:02] returned unto the Lord and said this,
[33:03] "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin
[33:05] and have made them gods of gold. Yet now
[33:08] if thou wilt forgive their sin, and if
[33:10] not blot me, I pray thee out of thy book
[33:13] which thou hast written." And the Lord
[33:14] said unto Moses, "Whosoever hast sinned
[33:16] against me, him will I blot out of my
[33:18] book. Therefore now go, lead the people
[33:21] unto the place of which I have spoken
[33:23] unto thee, behold, mine angel shall go
[33:25] before thee. Nevertheless, in the day
[33:26] when I visit, I will visit their sin
[33:28] upon them." And the Lord plagued the
[33:30] people because they made the calf which
[33:33] Aaron made. Amen. If we could bow our
[33:35] heads for a word of prayer. If you have
[33:38] a need tonight, just make it known unto
[33:40] the Lord.
[33:41] Amen. I believe he's a God that hears
[33:43] and answers. Heavenly Father, we
[33:46] approach your throne tonight, Lord
[33:48] Jesus, humbly, Father, yet boldly, Lord
[33:52] Jesus, because you went to Calvary,
[33:54] Father, and you shed a blood for our
[33:57] sins, Lord, that we might come back into
[33:59] fellowship with you, Lord Jesus. And
[34:02] Lord, it gives us a boldness in your our
[34:04] heart tonight, Father, that under that
[34:07] blood, we can approach you and ask,
[34:09] Father, and tell you how much we love
[34:12] you, Father, and tell tell you how much
[34:14] we appreciate you, Lord. And and tell
[34:16] you how thankful we are for all that
[34:18] you've done for us, Lord, and all that
[34:21] you're doing and all that you're going
[34:22] to do. and ask, Father, that you would
[34:25] just be the same yesterday, today, and
[34:28] forever once again in our needs, Lord
[34:30] Jesus. That you just minister once again
[34:32] to our hearts, Father. Lord, that you
[34:34] just come into the midst of your
[34:36] children once again. I pray and we'll be
[34:38] sure to give you the glory and honor in
[34:40] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. And you may
[34:43] have your seats tonight in the house of
[34:46] the Lord. And we just we just we're just
[34:50] trying not to hold you long tonight. I
[34:52] know it's a midweek and we just like to
[34:55] speak for a few moments out of that text
[34:57] on who is on the Lord's side. Amen. Who
[35:00] is on the Lord's side? And just a
[35:03] background for a few moments of of where
[35:06] we're at, the children of Israel. Of
[35:08] course, when when the Lord met Moses in
[35:11] a burning bush on Mount Horeb, he had
[35:14] promised them that when [snorts] they
[35:16] were brought out of Exodus that they
[35:18] would return to this mountain and serve
[35:20] God upon this mountain and and so uh uh
[35:24] he brought them out of Egypt. He carried
[35:26] them through the Red Sea and fed them
[35:28] mana, gave them water to drink and and
[35:31] as he promised, they returned to this
[35:33] mount. And now Mount Si and Mount Horeb
[35:36] would be the same mountain. And in the
[35:38] book of Psalms 106, it even says they
[35:41] made a calf in Horeb using that same
[35:44] name there. So showing that they
[35:46] returned to that same mountain and that
[35:48] he promised them that they would return
[35:50] and worship. And in Exodus 19, they came
[35:53] onto that mountain. And brother Brandham
[35:55] said that was where they made the
[35:57] greatest mistake they would ever make
[35:59] was in Exodus 19 when they began to the
[36:03] to the the that God that had brought him
[36:05] out of Egypt by grace. Grace had
[36:08] provided them a prophet. Grace had
[36:10] provided them Amen. mana. Grace had
[36:12] provided them spiritual leadership and
[36:15] all these things. But yet they wanted a
[36:17] law. They wanted something that they
[36:19] could do themselves. They wanted
[36:20] something of their own, something that
[36:22] they could follow. Amen. something of of
[36:25] of maybe uh rules and regulations. And
[36:28] when they rejected grace for law,
[36:30] brother Bram said how that was the
[36:31] greatest mistake that they made there
[36:33] right there in Exodus 19 and and in in
[36:36] some time I'd like to speak or or take
[36:39] some thoughts upon a mountain of grace
[36:41] showing that how that there they had
[36:43] went at Mount Si they had went from
[36:45] grace to law. Amen. But there was coming
[36:47] a day, of course, where our savior would
[36:50] come on Mount Calvary and begin to flip
[36:52] the script back from law onto a people
[36:55] could receive a grace to save their sins
[36:58] and to pardon them. And amen, that it
[37:00] wouldn't be based upon our our rules and
[37:02] regulations, but upon the blood that he
[37:04] shed at Mount Calvary. [snorts] Amen.
[37:06] But for that time, it became a throne of
[37:08] judgment. Because in Exodus 19 it would
[37:10] say how there were thunders and
[37:12] lightnings and a thick cloud upon the
[37:14] mount and the voice of a trumpet
[37:16] exceeding loud so that all that was in
[37:18] the camp trembled. And and brother
[37:20] Brandon would tie that together with
[37:22] Revelations 4, how John was caught up
[37:25] and a door was open. And it said
[37:27] immediately I was in the spirit and
[37:29] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[37:31] one sat on the throne and out of the
[37:33] throne proceeded lightnings and
[37:35] thunderings and voices. Sounds familiar,
[37:37] doesn't it? Amen. Showing how Moses,
[37:40] brother Brand would say, how he was
[37:42] caught up in the spirit and how he saw
[37:44] the same thing that John saw. And he
[37:47] said in Revelations 4, that throne was
[37:50] after the rapture had taken place. It
[37:53] was no longer a throne of mercy, but it
[37:55] was a throne of judgment. Amen. And and
[37:58] when Moses was up in that mount, it was
[38:00] no longer a mercy, but it was becoming a
[38:02] throne of judgment. And Moses would be
[38:05] caught up in the spirit and lightnings
[38:07] and thunderings would take place and he
[38:09] would begin to see a vision, amen, of
[38:12] how to build the tabernacle in the
[38:14] wilderness and how to do all these
[38:15] things. And if you notice, amen, he
[38:17] built the tabernacle just like the
[38:20] pattern he saw of the throne of God in
[38:23] heaven. He just like the four beasts
[38:25] would be seated around the throne in
[38:27] heaven. Moses would build a temple,
[38:29] amen, with those four those four sides
[38:31] with the eagle, the man, the ox, and a
[38:35] and and all of those creatures just like
[38:37] he saw in heaven. And I I I thought it
[38:40] was so wonderful because he was
[38:42] commanded to build on earth exactly
[38:44] after the pattern he saw in heaven. I
[38:47] thought my amen to see how God shows
[38:50] things in heaven before he does them on
[38:52] earth. Brother Brandon would teach that
[38:54] how how how before God would ever do any
[38:56] major event on earth, he would show it
[38:58] in the heavens. And a and we can see how
[39:01] John saw, amen, that there would be a
[39:04] lamb that would be slain before the
[39:06] foundation of the world. But one day
[39:08] that lamb came and was slain here on
[39:10] earth and how there would be someone
[39:12] that could come and take the book and
[39:15] and and in the 1963 when brother Brandon
[39:17] was standing there, he said, "Let him
[39:19] come forth." Amen. But it was patterned
[39:21] in heaven before it ever happened on
[39:23] earth. And I I I I I just think it's a
[39:26] wonderful thing. Maybe it's a little
[39:27] side note from where we're going
[39:28] tonight, but to think my all the
[39:30] wonderful things that have happened in
[39:32] heaven. How Job shouted. Amen. How there
[39:35] was sons of God shouting before the
[39:37] foundation of the world. And here we are
[39:39] tonight. Amen. Shouting and praising and
[39:42] worshiping. Amen. And serving a living
[39:44] God. Amen. Sure, there was angels that
[39:47] fell in heaven. Amen. But there was some
[39:49] angels that never fell. Amen. Which is
[39:52] telling me that tonight, Amen. Sure,
[39:54] there's some spirits that have fell,
[39:56] amen, out of heaven. But there's some
[39:58] angel spirits and sons and daughters of
[40:01] God tonight that never fell in heaven.
[40:03] Oh, I say it's in earth as it was in
[40:05] heaven. Amen. God has set forth a
[40:08] pattern and we're living it out. Amen.
[40:10] Tonight as a pattern of what's taking
[40:13] place in heaven. And I'm thankful that
[40:14] we've seen the back of the book. Amen.
[40:16] We've seen the pattern.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know, I mean, we know where
[40:20] we're at. And and it was so wonderful to
[40:23] me to see how Moses was seeing what John
[40:25] saw, what Paul saw in that vision. And
[40:28] he begin to build the temple, build that
[40:31] throne in the temple there in the
[40:32] wilderness after what he saw up in the
[40:35] mount. And while he was up there in the
[40:37] mount for 40 days, he was getting the
[40:39] commandments from God. And and one of
[40:42] those commandments was, "Thou shalt have
[40:43] no other gods before me. And thou shalt
[40:46] not make any graven image, or any
[40:48] likeness of anything that is in the
[40:50] heaven above, or that is in the earth
[40:52] beneath, or that is in the water under
[40:54] the earth. Thou shalt not bow down
[40:56] thyself to them. Now serve them. For I,
[40:59] the Lord thy God, am a jealous God,
[41:01] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[41:03] upon the children unto the third and
[41:04] fourth generation of them that hate me."
[41:08] [snorts] A and it would say in Exodus
[41:10] 22, he that sacrificeth unto any god
[41:13] save unto the Lord only, he shall be
[41:15] utterly destroyed. And and while Moses
[41:18] was in the mountain, he there was a
[41:20] there was a constant theme of don't bow
[41:22] down to these other gods. And but yet
[41:24] when he begins to come off the mountain,
[41:26] what does he see, brother Aaron? Except
[41:28] he hears the noise in the camp and and
[41:31] all these things are going on. And
[41:33] Joshua says, "There's the sound of war
[41:35] in the camp." And and Moses would say,
[41:37] "It don't sound like war. It sounds like
[41:39] singing and dancing and all these
[41:41] things." And he would come to find that
[41:43] they had convinced Aaron to build them a
[41:45] golden calf. Amen. A a calf in the image
[41:49] of maybe an Egyptian god or maybe in the
[41:52] image of some god of Baal or or or some
[41:55] other some other god that was not the
[41:59] the Jehovah God that had brought them
[42:01] out of Egypt and brought them through
[42:03] the Red Sea and they begin to worship.
[42:05] Moses was only gone for a few days.
[42:08] Amen. But they begin to cast away, Amen,
[42:10] the voice of Moses and begin to worship
[42:13] other gods. Amen. A and melted all their
[42:16] jewelry and put it into that into that
[42:18] great casting. Uh and it would it would
[42:22] spit out a cow. And they would say, "We
[42:24] throw this gold in and this calf
[42:26] appeared.
[42:28] This calf just appeared. We just we just
[42:30] threw this gold. We took off." And all
[42:32] of a sudden, this calf appeared. and
[42:33] they begin to worship it. Amen. And in
[42:36] and the book of Psalms would said that
[42:37] they changed their glory into the
[42:40] similitude of an ox that eateth grass
[42:42] and they forgot God their savior which
[42:45] had done great things in Egypt, wondrous
[42:47] works in the land of Ham and terrible
[42:49] things by the Red Sea. Therefore he said
[42:52] that that he would destroy them had not
[42:54] Moses his chosen stood before him in the
[42:57] breach to turn away his wrath lest he
[42:59] should destroy them. Amen. They had
[43:02] turned the glory that they had once
[43:04] served in the similitude of an ox that
[43:06] eateth grass. And brother Brandon would
[43:09] preach onto us Christianity versus
[43:11] idolatry and say how people would would
[43:14] have a desire to be forgiven of their
[43:16] sins and to and to contact a deity. And
[43:18] so they would make an image believing
[43:21] that that deity could condescend into
[43:24] that image and they could speak and that
[43:26] image could speak back and they could be
[43:28] forgiven of their sins and they could be
[43:30] set free and they could actually hear. I
[43:33] forget what he said now but I think they
[43:35] would speak at times into some sort of
[43:37] shell or something and their own voice
[43:39] would echo back to them and they would
[43:41] say that they were hearing from another
[43:43] deity, the god of the sea or something
[43:45] like that. And so, Brother Brandon would
[43:47] say it was exactly the antitype of
[43:49] Christianity because Christianity is
[43:52] when you prostrate yourself before a
[43:54] living God. And that God comes into you
[43:57] and makes you an idol. Makes you a
[44:00] living image. Amen. He comes into you
[44:02] and he speaks through your lips and he
[44:04] operates through your hands and he
[44:06] operates through your feet. And they had
[44:08] that in a prophet named Moses. They
[44:10] said, "We don't want to hear from God
[44:11] anymore, so we'll hear through his
[44:13] prophet." And God used the prophets,
[44:16] amen, but when his prophet was up on the
[44:18] mountain, they would say, "Let's build
[44:19] us an idol." Amen. That we might worship
[44:21] that instead. And and what a horrible
[44:24] thing it was. Even so much that later on
[44:26] in scripture, Amen. Dan and Ephraim
[44:29] would serve idols. Amen. Which God
[44:31] hated. and they would actually be
[44:33] blotted out of the book that when it
[44:35] come over to the age of the millennium
[44:37] that those 10 tribes, Amen, would be
[44:40] substituted with Levi and Joseph instead
[44:43] of Dan and Ephraim because they served
[44:45] idolatry. Amen. Brother Bran would say
[44:48] how it began in Babylon and it'll end in
[44:51] Babylon. It's idolatry. But in the midst
[44:53] of that, Moses stood up and said, "Who
[44:56] is on the Lord's side?" I mean, who will
[44:58] stand for me and God? Brother Brandham
[45:00] said, "In the days when sin was in the
[45:03] camp, when Balam taught the people to
[45:05] sin, [gasps] Moses said, "Who will stand
[45:07] for me and God and Levi pulled his sword
[45:10] said we will stand for you?" And they
[45:12] took that sword and cut every sin out of
[45:14] the camp and God made the rest of them
[45:16] pay tithes to them and they became the
[45:19] priesthood. And he said, "So is it today
[45:21] God is looking for somebody who will
[45:24] take the sword of the word. Some people
[45:26] is afraid to say those things." He said,
[45:28] "Don't be afraid. God before you, who
[45:30] can be against you? It's time that the
[45:32] church stood in its place again and cut
[45:35] sin. Jesus will come Sunday and there
[45:37] will be a rapture. Those who stand for
[45:39] him now, he will stand for them then.
[45:42] You love him. Oh, how I love him. I
[45:44] think my what about a prophet's cry that
[45:47] would say, you know, we've come this
[45:49] far. We've journeyed this far and here
[45:52] you are worshiping idols. and how a
[45:54] prophet, no doubt very disappointed and
[45:56] frustrated, would cry out, "Who is on
[45:59] the Lord's side? Is there anybody that's
[46:02] on the Lord's side? Is there anybody,
[46:04] Amen, that is tired of this idol worship
[46:06] and we should have left that in Egypt?
[46:08] We come out of all of that and here you
[46:11] are worshiping idols again. Is there
[46:12] anybody that is on the Lord's side?" I I
[46:15] think how Elijah got in a similar
[46:17] position when he was fighting against
[46:19] that Jezebel religion and he would say,
[46:21] "I'm the only one left
[46:24] and they're seeking to kill my life.
[46:26] It's only me." Amen. I'm the only one
[46:28] left standing. A and to think about how
[46:31] our prophet and and when it come up to
[46:34] this day and he was standing against
[46:36] those denominational spirits and a a and
[46:39] they crowded around the first pool and
[46:41] the second pool. But when he tried to
[46:43] bring the opening of the word unto them,
[46:45] they would walk away and and go back
[46:48] into their idols and go back into their
[46:50] denominations. And amen, no wonder the
[46:53] cry of a prophet would cry out, "Who is
[46:55] on the Lord's side?"
[46:57] Is there anybody left, Amen, that is
[46:59] willing, Amen, to stand for the word?
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God, there was always an
[47:05] elect, amen, in each age to respond to
[47:08] the cry to stand for the word. And the
[47:10] Bible says that that the children of
[47:13] Levi did according to the word of Moses.
[47:16] And there fell of the people that day
[47:18] about 3,000 men. Amen. There when Moses
[47:21] made the cry, there were some sons of
[47:23] Levi that responded to that cry. Amen.
[47:26] And they said, "We will follow your mo
[47:28] words, Moses. We will stand for that
[47:31] which you have spoken." And and brother
[47:33] Brandon would teach us. Someone asked
[47:35] them a question about the 144,000 and
[47:38] the bride and things and questions and
[47:40] answers number one, 1954. And he begins
[47:43] to answer them, beginning to separate
[47:45] the difference between the bride and the
[47:47] 144,000. And he begins to show how you
[47:50] have to look back to see the types and
[47:52] how the types would point to Calvary and
[47:55] things. And he just begins to answer
[47:56] them and bring it out. And in that
[47:59] questions and answers, he would begin to
[48:01] say, "Hallelujah. If you can see what
[48:03] that temple was, that Levites was the
[48:06] bride."
[48:08] It says, "Now when sin is awakening on
[48:11] every hand, the Levites is pulling their
[48:13] swords. The Holy Ghostborn bride is
[48:16] standing out saying Jesus Christ in the
[48:18] positive is Jesus Christ in the
[48:20] negative." Just the same. Sin is still
[48:23] sin. It's wrong to do these things.
[48:24] That's right. They're standing there
[48:26] with the sword. God says, "Come you now,
[48:28] the bless blessed of my father, that is
[48:31] the bride." And he said, "How those
[48:33] Levites stood for the word and they went
[48:36] into the temple and the others would
[48:38] serve them." Amen. Just like this bride
[48:40] will reign with him on the throne. Amen.
[48:43] In the 144,000 and the others will come
[48:46] and serve the bride. And he begin to
[48:48] show you have to look at the types to
[48:51] see where you're at to see who you are
[48:54] in this day because those were only
[48:56] pointing to this day. Amen. And to show,
[49:00] Amen. that those that are on the Lord's
[49:02] side would stand in each age. And just
[49:04] like in the days of an Elijah when he
[49:06] would cry out, God would tell him, "No,
[49:08] you're not alone. There's 7,000 others
[49:11] that are not going to bow their knee to
[49:13] that bell Jezebel religion, but they're
[49:16] going to stand for the word. Oh my. A
[49:19] and and brother Brandon would begin to
[49:21] speak an indictment. Amen. Now we're
[49:23] bringing it up to our day. The Levites
[49:25] are the bride. Is that right? And he
[49:27] says, I say it on this tape and for this
[49:30] audience. I say this under the
[49:32] inspiration of the Holy Ghost who is on
[49:34] the Lord's side. Let him come under this
[49:37] word. God will surely bring this wicked
[49:40] Christ denying Christ rejecting
[49:42] generation into judgment for blasphemy
[49:45] the crucifixion of his identified word
[49:47] they are coming to the judgment I
[49:49] indicted it who is on the Lord's side
[49:52] said Moses
[49:54] let him come unto me when the pillar of
[49:56] fire hanging there as an evidence who is
[49:59] on the Lord's side let him take up the
[50:01] word deny his creed and follow Jesus
[50:04] Christ daily and I'll meet you in
[50:06] [snorts] the morning amen Brother
[50:08] Brandon begins to indict this generation
[50:12] of denominations that had rejected Jesus
[50:14] Christ. Amen. Just like, Amen, they had
[50:18] done. Amen. In in his first coming and
[50:20] he begins to make a call, who is on the
[50:22] Lord's side? Let him come under this
[50:25] word. Amen. Because there was a lot of
[50:28] people that maybe, Amen, were friendly
[50:30] to brother Brandon, but not willing to
[50:32] come under the word. Not real, not
[50:35] willing to really come under the
[50:37] message. Amen. Amen. And that's what
[50:38] brother Brandham taught us. He said,
[50:40] "Don't just say, "I believe it." Don't
[50:42] just talk about the token, but get under
[50:44] the token. Get under the message and let
[50:47] it become headship over your life and
[50:50] stand for the word. Amen. Amen. That's
[50:53] why we are under a Nazerite vow today.
[50:56] Just like Moses told him after he was
[50:58] vindicated with a pillar of fire, he
[51:00] would say, "Don't you add or take away
[51:02] from the words that I spoken unto you."
[51:05] And brother Brandon would say, "So say I
[51:07] unto you. Don't you add or take away
[51:09] from what those tapes say." Amen. But
[51:12] you just say what's on those tapes.
[51:14] Amen. You just stand for this word.
[51:16] Amen. Just put your life under this
[51:18] word. Amen. And you'll be blessed. Oh
[51:21] my. Who's on the Who is willing to stand
[51:24] the reproach? Because Brother Bram said,
[51:26] "God's anointed word has always bore an
[51:29] approach."
[51:31] &gt;&gt; A reproach.
[51:33] Amen. But it says, "Blessed are ye when
[51:36] men shall hate you and shall separate
[51:38] you from their company and reproach you
[51:40] and cast out your name as evil for the
[51:42] son of man's sake." Cuz you see, there'd
[51:45] be many spirits that would try to come
[51:47] against amen that prophet's message.
[51:50] Amen. That's why, Amen, Moses. Amen.
[51:53] There was many spirits in that day.
[51:55] Amen. But but we see the types. Amen.
[51:59] And just like there was sin in the camp
[52:00] in that day, we see that there would be
[52:02] sin in the camp today. But just like
[52:04] there was a Levite to stand then, there
[52:07] will be an overcomer to stand in this
[52:09] day. Amen. With the message of the hour.
[52:12] And if you can ever see your type in the
[52:14] scripture, I mean, it'll liberate you to
[52:16] know, I mean, who you are and and where
[52:20] you're where you came from and and what
[52:23] you're going to play out in scripture if
[52:25] you can ever see who you are. And so we
[52:27] see that spirits never die. Amen. The
[52:31] same spirits that were alive in that
[52:33] Exodus are alive in this Exodus and they
[52:36] never die. And so we can look back in
[52:38] scripture and see the things that they
[52:40] would have to stand against in that day
[52:42] and know that we're going to have to
[52:44] stand against those same things to this
[52:46] day. Is that right? And and brother Bram
[52:48] said, "In the days when sin was in the
[52:50] camp, when Balam taught the people to
[52:53] sin, Moses said, "Who will stand for me
[52:56] and God?"
[52:58] Amen. And and so we see there was a
[53:00] Balum in that day. Amen. And there was a
[53:03] What was the difference between Balam
[53:05] and Moses? Amen. Balam was just as
[53:08] fundamental as Moses was. Thank you,
[53:10] brother. Balam was just as fundamental
[53:13] as Moses was. It says that he built
[53:15] seven altars just like Moses did. Amen.
[53:18] But it says he was a formal worshipper.
[53:22] He was formal just like Cain was. And
[53:24] brother Brandham actually called him the
[53:26] second Cain. Amen. Because it was I mean
[53:29] spirits never die. And the same spirit
[53:32] that was on Cain had come on Balum. And
[53:35] and he knew Amen. what was right. Amen.
[53:39] But he hated those people that were
[53:40] anointed. And so he refused. Amen. But
[53:44] he was under a different headship than
[53:45] Moses was. Though he was a prophet, but
[53:48] he was following the orders of Baal. I
[53:51] mean, that would say, "Go down and curse
[53:52] him. Go down and put a curse upon him."
[53:55] But being a prophet, when he got under
[53:57] the anointing, it would only speak the
[53:59] truth. And so, he couldn't curse what
[54:01] God had blessed. Amen. And I'm so
[54:04] thankful, Amen, that even the devil,
[54:06] Amen, cannot curse what God has blessed.
[54:09] Amen. If God has put a blessing over
[54:11] your life, Amen. Satan doesn't have
[54:13] enough power to curse it. Amen. But time
[54:16] after time, Bailac would get frustrated
[54:19] because Balam would go forth and only
[54:22] prophesy blessings over those children
[54:25] of Israel. Amen. But he he knew better
[54:28] than to even go down there because the
[54:30] Lord had told him, "Don't go." And the
[54:32] angel had stood in the way to stop him.
[54:34] But Balam was jealous and stubborn and
[54:37] went down there anyway. [laughter] Amen.
[54:39] Brother Brandham would tell us, "If you
[54:40] want to see another Balam, look at
[54:42] Nicodemus." Amen. Because he would say,
[54:44] "Thou art the Christ." And we know
[54:46] you're a man sent from God. Amen. They
[54:48] knew better, but they didn't have,
[54:50] [laughter]
[54:51] Amen, it in them to stand for the word
[54:53] in that day. They knew better. Amen. But
[54:56] they couldn't separate the difference.
[54:59] Amen. between the wheat, in between the
[55:01] shuck, because they couldn't have enough
[55:04] eyesab to see that that was the living
[55:07] word in their midst enough to take a
[55:09] stand for it. Amen. But they would they
[55:12] would come against it and crucify it and
[55:14] and jealous of it and hate it just like
[55:17] Cain did, [laughter] just like Balam
[55:19] did. Amen. But but what was the
[55:22] difference between Balam and Moses was
[55:24] Moses was identified by God. Moses was a
[55:28] scriptural prophet and being a
[55:30] scriptural prophet, he would only stay
[55:32] with the word. Amen. As you would hear
[55:34] brother Brandham say, is not a prophet a
[55:36] divine interpreter of the word. Amen.
[55:39] But Balum, brother Brandham would say
[55:41] that the prophecy of Balum was correct,
[55:43] but his teaching was altogether wrong.
[55:46] And it was the teaching of Balum, Amen,
[55:49] that would begin to corrupt the minds of
[55:52] the people in that day. Amen. And what
[55:55] Balam's teachings were, Amen. Amen.
[55:57] We'll boil it down to the core thought
[55:59] was that we are all the same. Amen. And
[56:02] and we are all the same. And even in the
[56:05] book of Revelations to the Pergamus age,
[56:08] it would say, I have a few things
[56:09] against thee because thou hast there
[56:11] them that hold the doctrine of Balum.
[56:14] And in second Peter 2, it would talk
[56:16] about those that have forsaken the right
[56:18] way and are gone astray following the
[56:21] way of Balum. Amen. showing that that
[56:24] Balum teaching, Amen, would be a wicked
[56:27] and adulterous thing that would lead
[56:29] them into a trap. Amen. Saying we are we
[56:32] are all the same. Let us unite. We're
[56:35] all the same. Amen. We all believe that
[56:37] there's a God. We all believe this and
[56:39] that. We're all the same. Amen. But they
[56:42] couldn't see the difference. Amen. And
[56:44] it would go as far Amen. Amen. Just bear
[56:47] with me. We'll Amen. We're just laying
[56:49] the foundation here. But it would go as
[56:51] far as onto the feast of Bior where
[56:55] Balam would say, "Well, if I can't curse
[56:58] them, then I'll get them to commit
[57:01] adultery that God will have to judge
[57:04] them for their sins." And they begin to
[57:06] send out invitations saying, "Come to
[57:08] this feast and then come and celebrate."
[57:11] And those Israelites had been to feast
[57:14] before. So they thought, "It would be
[57:15] okay. What's really wrong? After all,
[57:17] it's fellowship. We're supposed to get
[57:19] along with one another. Amen. It's just
[57:22] a It's just a feast. Amen. But he said,
[57:24] "Oh my." Brother Brandham would say it
[57:26] wasn't so simple. It wasn't so innocent
[57:29] when those Moab women would begin to get
[57:31] out and dance in front of them and those
[57:33] Israelite men would begin to commit
[57:36] fornication with the daughters of Moab.
[57:39] Amen. And brother Brandon would say it
[57:40] was the same spirit how Constantine
[57:43] would want to build his kingdom so he
[57:46] would have a nine council. And brother
[57:48] Brand would say those true believers
[57:50] were there, but they had no business
[57:52] going to that meeting. And when they and
[57:54] they ended up leaving, but he said they
[57:57] had no business being there in the first
[57:58] place. Amen. Because Constantine was
[58:02] trying to get everybody to come under
[58:04] the same teaching. Amen. And it may not
[58:06] have been natural fornication, but it
[58:08] was spiritual fornication. And brother
[58:11] Brandon would say that fornication is
[58:12] the same spirit. Amen. as organized
[58:15] religion because they come under the
[58:18] guise, amen, of unity and fellowship.
[58:21] Amen. But the Bible says, "How can two
[58:23] walk together except they be agreed?"
[58:26] Amen. And when those children of Israel
[58:28] were going through the wilderness on
[58:29] their journey, they were going to pass
[58:31] by Esau's mountain in Moab's land. And
[58:35] brother Brandon would say, "But don't
[58:37] you stop there because that's not your
[58:39] inheritance." Amen. They would could I
[58:42] mean, they could say, "Whoa." I mean,
[58:44] we've tasted of denominations. It's not
[58:46] so bad. But brother Brandham said, "No."
[58:48] Amen. Your inheritance is Jacob's
[58:51] mountain and it lays beyond the river.
[58:54] Amen. Don't stop. Don't fuss with them.
[58:57] Don't argue with them. Don't turn to the
[58:59] right or the left. But just keep walking
[59:01] with Moses because he's taken you
[59:04] somewhere greater. Amen. Than Esau's
[59:06] mountain. Oh, I said don't join up with
[59:09] them. Amen. If they were predestined to
[59:12] go across the river, they would have
[59:14] joined. Amen. But that was not their
[59:16] inheritance. So you can't make all the
[59:19] Lutheran see it. And you can't make all
[59:21] the Baptists see it. Amen. But you which
[59:24] have eyes to see, you which have ears to
[59:27] hear, you which have something in your
[59:29] heart, a deep calling to the deep. Amen.
[59:32] That's what caused you to go past the
[59:35] denominational churches and led you amen
[59:38] into Jordan's land into the land of
[59:41] inheritance into the message of the hour
[59:44] because there was something in you that
[59:45] wasn't satisfied with taking sides.
[59:49] Amen. With just a creed or a dogma,
[59:52] amen, or just a watered down just seeing
[59:54] religion but said, "As for me in my
[59:57] house, there is an inheritance beyond
[59:59] the river. I've taken sides with the
[1:00:02] message of the hour and it's carrying me
[1:00:05] farther than the denominations would
[1:00:07] ever take me. Oh, you could walk with
[1:00:09] them far enough. But there'll come a day
[1:00:12] where the eagle had to leave the chicken
[1:00:14] yard and say, "The message is calling me
[1:00:16] farther. The message is calling me
[1:00:19] higher. And I have stake my claim."
[1:00:21] Amen. [snorts] With that pillar of fire,
[1:00:24] wherever it leads, that's where I'll go.
[1:00:26] Amen. I'm not going to put my tent pegs
[1:00:28] down. Amen. Where that pillar of fire
[1:00:31] goes, brother Ben, we're moving with it.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're not going to put a period on
[1:00:36] it. That's why brother Brandham, Amen,
[1:00:38] he was not a Bum, but he was a Moses and
[1:00:41] he couldn't take sides with those
[1:00:43] denominations. He would say, I I'll take
[1:00:45] sides with all of them. Amen. I I but
[1:00:48] but he wasn't taking sides with him
[1:00:50] under the headship, Amen. [snorts]
[1:00:53] of Rome. But he was taking sides with
[1:00:55] them, Amen. that if they could come
[1:00:57] under the headship of the word, then we
[1:00:59] can have fellowship. Amen. [snorts]
[1:01:01] Because if two can't be agreed, how can
[1:01:04] they walk together? Amen. That's why we
[1:01:06] don't have to go to the same church to
[1:01:08] walk together. Amen. We don't have to be
[1:01:10] under a pope to walk together. Amen. But
[1:01:12] if you'll just get under the message of
[1:01:14] the hour, Amen. We can have fellowship
[1:01:17] everything under the blood. Amen. We can
[1:01:19] have fellowship. Amen. Amen. That's why
[1:01:22] it's a dangerous thing. Amen. when the
[1:01:24] devil tries to sew seeds of fellowship.
[1:01:27] Amen. That are trying to lead you away
[1:01:29] from the word of the hour. Oh, because
[1:01:32] that feast of Belpor and Moses would cry
[1:01:35] out slay every one of them. And then one
[1:01:38] Israelite brought a Moab woman back with
[1:01:41] them to the camp and they began to walt
[1:01:44] in the camp with his Moabitete woman.
[1:01:46] And there was a Levite by the name of
[1:01:48] Phineas. I don't know how to pronounce
[1:01:50] it, but he grabbed a spear and went into
[1:01:53] the tent and thrust him through and
[1:01:55] stayed the wrath of God from that camp.
[1:01:57] Oh, thank God. There was a Levite.
[1:01:59] [laughter] Amen. That wasn't willing to
[1:02:01] put up with all of that nonsense and
[1:02:03] idolatry, but said that will not come
[1:02:06] into this camp. Amen. This is a camp for
[1:02:08] the Lord. Amen. We're under a pillar of
[1:02:11] fire in this camp. Oh, and brother
[1:02:14] Brandon would say there's another Balum
[1:02:16] system rising up together. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:19] But Amen. But brother Brandon would not
[1:02:21] yoke himself to any of that.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; But he would take sides with Jesus.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to be careful what
[1:02:28] you take sides with.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon would say,
[1:02:32] "Amen, [snorts] that you are not of
[1:02:33] them. You are not. They're
[1:02:36] denominational people, which is all
[1:02:37] right. Nothing against them. There's
[1:02:39] plenty of fine Christians out among
[1:02:41] them. But you oughten to associate
[1:02:43] yourself in that unbelieving groups."
[1:02:45] Now, there's a spirit out there that
[1:02:47] doesn't like that at all. Amen. It's all
[1:02:50] about love and fellowship and and and
[1:02:52] everyone bring them all together. But
[1:02:54] brother Ram said, "We are not the same."
[1:02:56] Amen. You are a separated people holy
[1:02:59] onto the Lord. And there's a group out
[1:03:02] there, amen, that deny the power
[1:03:04] thereof. And brother Brandham said,
[1:03:05] "You're not to take sides with them."
[1:03:08] Amen. But in the message, I will
[1:03:10] restore. He said, "When the Holy Ghost
[1:03:11] comes down, I won't moan and groan and
[1:03:14] take sides against it, I'll agree with
[1:03:16] it and frolic with it and live with it
[1:03:20] and speak with it and sing with it and
[1:03:22] shout with it and die with it.
[1:03:24] Hallelujah." Because we've taken sides
[1:03:27] with Jesus. That's why we're in
[1:03:29] agreement with the spirit of God moving
[1:03:31] in the church because it's Jesus. Amen.
[1:03:35] Did not that spirit speak to those
[1:03:37] disciples on the water, it is I be not
[1:03:40] afraid. Amen. And when that same
[1:03:42] supernatural God would come and manifest
[1:03:45] itself in the ministry of William
[1:03:47] Brandham and people would call it amen
[1:03:49] be elabub or some sort of spook, but we
[1:03:52] don't fear it because we know it's
[1:03:54] Jesus.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, and brother Bram said, I know they
[1:03:58] got erratics and everything, but I'll
[1:03:59] take my way with them. I'll put my
[1:04:02] choice down there. If I have to take
[1:04:03] sides, I'll be right there. Ah, I like
[1:04:07] the way he says that. If I have to take
[1:04:08] sides, because brother Steven Caressle
[1:04:11] one time, maybe he did it here, I don't
[1:04:13] know. I mean, but he's famous back where
[1:04:15] we're at for saying the power side. I
[1:04:18] mean, he said, "If I have to take sides,
[1:04:20] I'll take the power side." [laughter] I
[1:04:22] mean, and the way he said it, you know,
[1:04:24] Brother Steven here, there's only I
[1:04:26] mean, one brother Stephen, he would say,
[1:04:28] "Well, whoops. accidentally got healed
[1:04:31] of cancer. Whoops. You accidentally got
[1:04:33] delivered. [laughter] Amen. Because on
[1:04:35] the power side, Amen. There's power for
[1:04:38] deliverance. There's power for the Holy
[1:04:40] Ghost to move. There's power for healing
[1:04:43] to take place. Amen. But brother Brandon
[1:04:45] would tell you how education and culture
[1:04:47] will put you on the devil's side. But I
[1:04:50] don't want to be on the devil's side. I
[1:04:51] want to be on the power side. Oh my.
[1:04:54] Because because you can't get wildfire
[1:04:58] from a painted fire. That's why many
[1:05:00] devils, Amen, would try to get a church
[1:05:03] to follow the painted fire path. Amen.
[1:05:06] Because it's safe. You can't get
[1:05:08] wildfire. It can't get out of order.
[1:05:11] Amen. But brother Brand would say, I've
[1:05:13] rather have a little wildfire than no
[1:05:16] fire at all. Amen. So, I'll take sides
[1:05:19] with Jesus. I'll take sides with the
[1:05:22] moving of the spirit. I'll take sides. I
[1:05:24] mean, if it ever gets a little wild, and
[1:05:26] I'd say that we haven't seen much
[1:05:28] wildfire around here, I think it's
[1:05:31] genuine fire, but if it would ever get
[1:05:33] out of order, there's a God that can
[1:05:35] bring it back into order. And but just
[1:05:37] like that little young eagle that's
[1:05:39] learning to fly, Brother Brandon would
[1:05:41] say, "Mother Eagle is watching over that
[1:05:43] eagle. And if it ever gets topsyturvy,
[1:05:46] Mother Eagle can take it and set it back
[1:05:48] into balance." Amen. But if it's a
[1:05:51] painted fire, Amen. There's no power in
[1:05:53] it. Oh, so we don't want to take sides
[1:05:56] with that, but we want to take sides
[1:05:58] with Jesus. Amen. So, you got to be
[1:06:01] careful. A what you take sides with.
[1:06:04] Amen. Because brother Brand would talk
[1:06:05] about how those spirits would try to get
[1:06:08] in the church and and and begin to
[1:06:10] inject their poison ideas into the
[1:06:13] church and and get people to take sides
[1:06:15] with this and that and say this is not
[1:06:17] right and that's not right. And that
[1:06:20] spirit would try to seow discord among
[1:06:23] the brethren. And and and the Bible says
[1:06:25] that there's six things that God hates.
[1:06:28] And one of those is seowing discord
[1:06:30] among brethren. It would say how they
[1:06:33] would begin to rise up and begin to
[1:06:35] criticize this and criticize that and
[1:06:38] and try to get one to take sides against
[1:06:40] it. And brother Brandham said most of
[1:06:42] the time it's the very person that's
[1:06:44] making the stir that is not right to
[1:06:46] begin with. Amen. Talking out a turn.
[1:06:49] And he said it's not becoming to a
[1:06:51] Christian starting a little fuss here
[1:06:53] and starting a little fuss there. And
[1:06:56] then and then and in the message
[1:06:57] enticing spirits he deals with it very
[1:07:00] heavy. Amen. And he begins to come down
[1:07:02] to say amen. Amen. That you could become
[1:07:05] like Isaiah and say woe is me for I am a
[1:07:08] man of unclean lips. And he begins to
[1:07:10] really deal with that spirit of sewing
[1:07:13] discord among brethren. And I like what
[1:07:17] he says here because brother Bram said,
[1:07:19] "I don't want to listen to that old
[1:07:21] spirit anymore. It's the thing that's
[1:07:23] kept me down all my life from having
[1:07:26] real love and freedom of Christ." Amen.
[1:07:30] Brother Brandon begins to identify that
[1:07:32] that spirit of gossip and discord and
[1:07:35] things. Amen. Be careful to take sides
[1:07:38] with it because if you're not careful,
[1:07:40] it will actually hold you down. And
[1:07:42] that's why when a preacher gets up and
[1:07:44] preaches against the spirit, I mean,
[1:07:46] he's not doing it just to sometimes
[1:07:49] sometimes our righteous indignation gets
[1:07:51] up. [laughter] Amen. Don't get me wrong.
[1:07:53] And I'm sure you all feel it, too. I
[1:07:55] mean, when you see the devil trying to
[1:07:57] destroy a a young person or something,
[1:07:59] your righteous indignation gets up. But
[1:08:01] but what we see here is that Brother
[1:08:03] Brandham's saying it's the thing that's
[1:08:05] kept you down all your life. Amen. From
[1:08:08] having real love and freedom. Amen.
[1:08:11] That's why we preach against these
[1:08:12] things is because I mean we see sons and
[1:08:15] daughters of God and then get bound down
[1:08:18] by spirits of confusion or spirits of
[1:08:21] pornography or spirits of gossip or this
[1:08:24] or that. And we want to see the children
[1:08:26] of God free. Amen. Amen. Say be careful
[1:08:29] what you take sides with. Amen. You
[1:08:32] shouldn't give an ear to those things,
[1:08:34] but you should take sides with Jesus.
[1:08:36] That's what we're here to do tonight is
[1:08:38] take sides with Jesus to sow seow the
[1:08:42] word into hearts. Seow love into hearts.
[1:08:46] Amen. So, Amen. encouragement into
[1:08:49] hearts. Amen. Not discord into hearts.
[1:08:52] Amen. For God hates that. Amen. But we
[1:08:55] find, Amen. There was another spirit in
[1:08:58] the land and it was the spirit of Dayan
[1:09:00] and Kora.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, you know, brother
[1:09:03] Brandon teaches about that. Amen. And
[1:09:06] brother Bram said, Moses said, "All is
[1:09:08] on the Lord's side. Come with me."
[1:09:10] That's right. See, and he just opened up
[1:09:12] the earth and swallowed them up. See,
[1:09:14] because Dayan and Kora would say unto
[1:09:16] Moses, "You take too much upon you. All
[1:09:20] the congregation is holy." And and in
[1:09:23] the multitude of counsel there is
[1:09:25] safety. Brother Brandham said, 'Well,
[1:09:28] sure, but that scripture is referring to
[1:09:30] war, not to ministry, [laughter] not to
[1:09:34] the church. Is that God doesn't deal
[1:09:37] with groups. God deals with individuals
[1:09:39] and he works through a prophet. Amen.
[1:09:42] But but Dayan couldn't swallow that. He
[1:09:45] didn't want that one man leadership. And
[1:09:47] and they [snorts] would try to raise up
[1:09:50] Amen. and try to impersonate a prophet.
[1:09:52] Amen. Just like Janice and Jambers would
[1:09:54] try to impersonate, but but they didn't
[1:09:56] realize that Moses had thus sayeth the
[1:09:59] Lord.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I'm showing this now to
[1:10:03] show types because when brother Brandon
[1:10:05] was here, he ran into the same thing.
[1:10:08] And he and when he was in South Africa,
[1:10:10] he said, "It's not the Lord's will that
[1:10:12] we go to that town. We're supposed to go
[1:10:14] to this town." And those preachers over
[1:10:16] there said, "I mean, does God only speak
[1:10:19] to you, Brother Brandham?" Amen. We're
[1:10:21] supposed to go. I think we're supposed
[1:10:23] to go. Does God only speak to you? And
[1:10:25] brother Bram said, "Oh, Kora said the
[1:10:27] same thing right before the earth
[1:10:30] swallowed them up." Amen. But here's
[1:10:32] what we're going to get to. Amen.
[1:10:34] Tonight, brother Bram said, "Thank God
[1:10:36] all Israel never fell for Kora." Some
[1:10:40] stayed by Moses, the anointed prophet,
[1:10:43] with the word of God. Same it is same as
[1:10:46] it is today with many of God's elected
[1:10:49] by his word. and by his spirit. Oh my.
[1:10:54] Amen. There was spirits that they had to
[1:10:57] stand against in that Exodus. Amen. So,
[1:11:00] if we want to background it when Moses
[1:11:02] made a call, who was on the Lord's side?
[1:11:05] I mean, it wasn't just I mean, I I sure
[1:11:08] I'll take sides with the Lord. That that
[1:11:10] might that sounds pretty cool. They were
[1:11:12] having to stand against a lot of spirits
[1:11:15] to make that stand. And some of those
[1:11:17] things, Amen. Amen. Bpor and some of
[1:11:20] those things didn't happen till after
[1:11:22] Exodus 32. Amen. But but but but just to
[1:11:25] show the things that were opposing them
[1:11:28] in that Exodus. And sometimes Amen.
[1:11:30] those spirits maybe they haven't come to
[1:11:32] notoriety yet or to to fullness yet, but
[1:11:35] they're still at work.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the true believer and says,
[1:11:41] "I'll take I'll take my stand with the
[1:11:43] Lord." Amen. That's Amen. Because the
[1:11:47] brother Brandon said there was three
[1:11:48] groups.
[1:11:49] Amen. There was Balam, Dayan, and Kora
[1:11:53] anointed by a supernatural Satan. But
[1:11:56] there was Moses, Joshua, and Caleb
[1:11:58] anointed by a supernatural God. Oh my.
[1:12:03] Amen. And brother Brandham told us that
[1:12:04] Caleb was that believer. Amen. That
[1:12:07] followed that pillar of fire that was
[1:12:09] led by that Holy Ghost. Amen. Caleb is
[1:12:12] my type. Amen. Sure there's a Balum
[1:12:15] brother Ben. Sure there's a Dayan. Sure
[1:12:18] there's a Kora. Amen. But that's not my
[1:12:20] type. Amen. But Caleb is my type. Amen.
[1:12:24] Caleb is the believer of this day. Amen.
[1:12:27] That says, Amen. I'm going to take sides
[1:12:30] with the message. Amen. Just like Joshua
[1:12:32] said, I won't turn to the right or to
[1:12:35] the left. This book of the law shall not
[1:12:38] depart out of my mouth, but I will bear
[1:12:40] the reproach of the word of Moses.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, what he did to
[1:12:46] somebody else that was true to the cause
[1:12:49] and what he did to somebody else that
[1:12:50] was untrue for the cause, he said, then
[1:12:53] you read your name in it. If you'd have
[1:12:56] been there, what stand would you have
[1:12:58] took? And remember, you got the
[1:13:00] privilege today to take the same kind of
[1:13:04] stand. I mean, he said, "I wish I was
[1:13:06] there to stand for Moses in that day." I
[1:13:09] mean, you don't have to wait any longer.
[1:13:11] He said, "You have the privilege to take
[1:13:13] the same kind of stand today when
[1:13:16] brother Brandham would cry out who was
[1:13:18] on the Lord's side. Let him come under
[1:13:21] this word. You don't have to look back
[1:13:23] thousands of years to some Bible story."
[1:13:26] Amen. But the same question has fallen
[1:13:29] across your ears in this age. Who is on
[1:13:31] the Lord's side? Let him come under the
[1:13:34] message of the hour. Let him put his
[1:13:36] family under the message of the hour.
[1:13:38] Let him live according to the message of
[1:13:40] the hour and take up the word and deny
[1:13:43] his creed and follow Jesus Christ daily.
[1:13:46] I mean, this is the choosing time,
[1:13:48] friends, to say, "Who is on the Lord's
[1:13:50] side?" I mean, brother Brand would say,
[1:13:52] "Oh, you can't stand neutral." I mean,
[1:13:54] you've got to choose one side to the
[1:13:56] other. You can't serve God and mammon.
[1:13:59] Amen. So if you're going to have to make
[1:14:01] a choice, then I want to say like
[1:14:03] Joshua, if he would ask, "Choose you
[1:14:06] this day who you will serve." I say,
[1:14:08] "Ask for me in my house. We're going to
[1:14:10] serve the Lord."
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And now he would say, "Now, now are you
[1:14:14] sure you want to serve the Lord now? Get
[1:14:17] you witnesses if you want to serve the
[1:14:18] Lord." Amen. Then put away your strange
[1:14:21] gods. Amen. Oh, I like how the scripture
[1:14:25] says it. He says, "Choose you this day
[1:14:27] whom you will serve, whether the gods
[1:14:30] which your father served that were on
[1:14:32] the other side of the flood or the gods
[1:14:34] of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell.
[1:14:37] But as for me in my house, we will serve
[1:14:40] the Lord." Amen. He would say, "Amen. Do
[1:14:44] you want to serve the gods of your
[1:14:47] fathers who believe the word and were
[1:14:49] carried through the flood? Or do you
[1:14:52] want to believe the gods of the Amorites
[1:14:55] and whose land you're dwelling right
[1:14:57] now?
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost comical. Amen. But but
[1:15:02] yet so many fell for it. [gasps]
[1:15:05] But he would say, "Do you want to serve
[1:15:06] the gods of your fathers or the gods of
[1:15:09] the Amorites?" Amen. And yeah, those
[1:15:12] Amorites, if you want to serve your
[1:15:14] gods, their gods, they just got kicked
[1:15:17] out of their own land.
[1:15:19] And those that took my word are
[1:15:21] possessing their land. Amen. Do you want
[1:15:24] to serve their gods or do you want to
[1:15:26] serve the one and true living God? Amen.
[1:15:28] Do you want to serve the God who owns
[1:15:30] the cattle on a thousand heels? Or do
[1:15:32] you want to serve the God who's going to
[1:15:35] have to give up the whole earth? Amen.
[1:15:37] To the believers, for the meek shall
[1:15:39] inherit the earth. Amen. Do you want to
[1:15:42] serve the God who wants you to be
[1:15:43] healed? Who wants you to be saved? Who
[1:15:46] wants you to be delivered? Or do you
[1:15:48] want to serve the God who is cancer, who
[1:15:51] is demonic power, who is bondage?
[1:15:54] [laughter] Oh my. Do you want to serve
[1:15:56] the God? Amen. Who is the message? And
[1:16:00] who's calling out a bride? Or do you
[1:16:02] want to serve the God, Amen, who's
[1:16:05] trying to come against this message and
[1:16:07] is headed, Amen, for hell's fire. Amen.
[1:16:10] You know, they had so many gods in that
[1:16:12] day. They they would serve Bal who is
[1:16:15] the god of fertility and say my I I if
[1:16:18] if we offend our God if we don't worship
[1:16:21] our God. Amen. Then then then all our
[1:16:24] crops are going to die. Amen. Then we're
[1:16:26] not going to be able to be fertile any
[1:16:28] longer. Amen. But I like what the
[1:16:30] scripture says in Deuteronomy 7 about
[1:16:33] those that would keep the commandments
[1:16:35] and hearken onto the sayings of the
[1:16:36] Lord. He said, "He will love thee, and
[1:16:39] bless thee, and multiply thee, and bless
[1:16:42] the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of
[1:16:45] thy land, and thy corn, and thy wine,
[1:16:47] and thine oil, and increase thy kind,
[1:16:50] and the flocks of thy sheep, and the
[1:16:51] land which you swear unto thy fathers to
[1:16:54] give thee. Thou shalt be blessed above
[1:16:56] all people, and there shall not be male
[1:16:58] or female barren among you, or among
[1:17:01] your cattle." Oh my friends, ex you can
[1:17:05] either pack around your 1,000 7,000
[1:17:08] gods. You need one for your fertility.
[1:17:11] You need one for your rain. You need one
[1:17:13] for this, one for that, one for this,
[1:17:16] one for that. Or you can serve the one
[1:17:18] and true living God and he'll bless you
[1:17:21] and he'll bless your womb and he'll
[1:17:23] bless your family and he'll bless your
[1:17:25] children and he'll bless your reign.
[1:17:28] Amen. And he'll bless you with with
[1:17:30] great benefits. Amen. I say, "As for me
[1:17:32] in my house, we will serve the Lord."
[1:17:36] Oh, as Elijah would crawl out, why halt
[1:17:39] ye between two opinions? If Belle be
[1:17:41] God, then serve him. But if but God be
[1:17:44] God, then serve the one and true living
[1:17:47] God.
[1:17:49] Oh, that's how I feel. If the message is
[1:17:51] right, we should give our all to it.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's not right, Amen. then go
[1:17:56] serve the living God. But if this
[1:17:58] message is right, Amen. And then we
[1:18:00] should serve it with all of our hearts.
[1:18:03] Oh, brother Brandon would say, "Where is
[1:18:05] the gods of Balum? Where is your critic
[1:18:07] that says the Holy Spirit is not right?
[1:18:09] Come forth and do the same thing." Say,
[1:18:13] "Where is the gods of these
[1:18:14] denominations?"
[1:18:16] Let them come forth and do the same
[1:18:18] thing. Amen. But if this God be true,
[1:18:21] Amen. then follow him. Amen. And if it
[1:18:24] is true, and if you are on the Lord's
[1:18:26] side, then he would say, "Now, Levites,
[1:18:29] draw your sword and put it by your side
[1:18:32] and start to clean out the camp." Amen.
[1:18:36] It's time to clean out the house. Isn't
[1:18:39] that what Jesus did when he came on
[1:18:41] earth? He began to braid together a whip
[1:18:43] and go into the temple and say, "You
[1:18:45] have made the house of God a den of
[1:18:48] thieves." And he began to flip over the
[1:18:50] tables and drive them out of the land
[1:18:53] because they had no place in the house
[1:18:55] of God. And they had turned it into a
[1:18:57] den of thieves. Amen. But the when the
[1:19:00] word was manifested in the midst of
[1:19:02] those idols, it begin to braid whips and
[1:19:05] knock it out and say, "Get out of my
[1:19:07] father's house. You have no right here."
[1:19:10] Amen. Don't take your idols into my
[1:19:12] father's house. This is the house of
[1:19:15] worship. This is a house with a certain
[1:19:18] glory. Amen. Should have preeminence,
[1:19:21] not a house, amen, to make an extra
[1:19:23] dime. Oh my. When those spirits try to
[1:19:26] come in and bring their pyramid schemes
[1:19:29] and try to Amen. try to pull, Amen.
[1:19:32] Amen. People to make money. Oh my. It's
[1:19:36] about every other week you read on the
[1:19:38] news about another denominational pastor
[1:19:40] that's going to jail. Amen. For for some
[1:19:43] sort of Amen. fault or failure because
[1:19:46] of money or women or this or that. Amen.
[1:19:50] But God is saying, "Is there any
[1:19:52] Levites?" Amen. That'll clean up the
[1:19:54] camp and stand for this. Amen. That is
[1:19:57] right. And call black and white white.
[1:20:00] Oh, brother Brandon would preach the
[1:20:02] invasion of the United States. And he
[1:20:03] would say, "Help us to stand and pull
[1:20:06] the sword quickly and fight for God as
[1:20:09] Moses and the Levites did down there
[1:20:11] when sin was in the camp." Oh, there's
[1:20:14] an invasion on and Satan has invaded
[1:20:17] this country and he's invaded the
[1:20:19] pulpits and he's tried to invade the
[1:20:22] homes and he's tried to invade real
[1:20:24] motherhood and real fatherhood and he's
[1:20:28] tried to invade the young people. Amen.
[1:20:30] But I say as for me in my house, Amen.
[1:20:33] We're not going to put up, Amen, with
[1:20:35] Satan's attack. But we have a sword. And
[1:20:39] as long as I have a sword in my hand, I
[1:20:42] say, "Satan, this is our land." Amen. We
[1:20:45] were given this land to possess it. And
[1:20:47] I know it's full of giants. Amen. But
[1:20:50] God has promised my father Abraham.
[1:20:52] Amen. That this is my land. And so I'm
[1:20:55] not going to bow down to any giant, but
[1:20:59] I'm going to destroy it. Oh, but the
[1:21:02] Bible says, "My angel is going to go
[1:21:04] before you and bring you in to the
[1:21:05] Amorites and Hittites and Perizzites and
[1:21:08] Canaanites and Hivites and Jebusites,
[1:21:10] and I will cut them off. Thou shalt not
[1:21:12] bow down to their gods, nor serve them,
[1:21:15] nor do after their works, but shall
[1:21:17] utterly destroy them and quite break
[1:21:19] down their images." Brother Brandham
[1:21:22] said about that scripture that we're
[1:21:24] babying a whole lot of things we ought
[1:21:27] to be destroying. [laughter] is said,
[1:21:28] "We're petting a whole lot of things
[1:21:30] that we ought to be destroying." And
[1:21:32] they would say, "Oh, that little
[1:21:34] Jebusite.
[1:21:35] It's so cute." [laughter]
[1:21:37] He said, "I'll grow up to be just like
[1:21:39] its daddy." Amen. He said, "You ought to
[1:21:42] utterly destroy it." Amen. Because this
[1:21:45] is our land to possess. He said, "You
[1:21:47] shouldn't pet that sickness. You
[1:21:49] shouldn't pet that complex. You should
[1:21:51] shouldn't pet this or that, but you
[1:21:52] should destroy it." Amen. because we're
[1:21:56] going to our land. We've got a
[1:21:59] destination, friends. And while we're
[1:22:01] passing through the land of Leodysia,
[1:22:04] you're going to encounter some idols of
[1:22:07] uh of fashion and entertainment and and
[1:22:10] some idols of lukewarmness and dead
[1:22:13] religion and this and that. Amen. But we
[1:22:16] are not to bow down to it. We are to
[1:22:18] possess it. Oh, praise God. I I thank
[1:22:22] God for some real Amen. sons and
[1:22:25] daughters of God that are an example,
[1:22:27] amen, of what we should live like
[1:22:29] because I believe we need some examples.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Caleb would stand up and
[1:22:35] say, "We're more than able to take the
[1:22:36] land."
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And he was an example unto the rest of
[1:22:40] the children of Israel. Amen. That we
[1:22:43] are more than able to take the land. A
[1:22:46] and Paul would write unto Timothy,
[1:22:48] Timothy, let no man despise thy youth,
[1:22:50] but be thou an example. Amen. in word
[1:22:53] and conversation and in spirit and
[1:22:56] purity and and there's a lot of negative
[1:23:00] examples. The scripture would say how
[1:23:02] Sodom and Gomorrah as an example and was
[1:23:05] set forth as an example in the book of
[1:23:07] Jude giving themselves over to
[1:23:09] fornication and going after strange
[1:23:11] flesh and set forth for an example
[1:23:14] suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
[1:23:17] I mean those that disbelieved the word
[1:23:20] in the first Exodus and didn't go all
[1:23:22] the way into the land, the Bible say how
[1:23:25] don't follow after that same example of
[1:23:28] unbelief. Amen. So if there can be an
[1:23:31] example in the negative, brother Paul, I
[1:23:33] believe there can be an example in the
[1:23:34] positive. And the Bible says how Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ was made our example.
[1:23:40] Amen. About how it says, Amen. He did no
[1:23:43] sin, neither was guile found in his
[1:23:46] mouth. When he was reviled, he reviled
[1:23:49] not again. When he suffered, he
[1:23:50] threatened not, but committed himself to
[1:23:53] him that judgeth righteously.
[1:23:56] Amen. And I believe the Bible teaches us
[1:23:58] that our aged woman should ought to be
[1:24:01] an example onto our young woman, how to
[1:24:04] serve in the house, how to love their
[1:24:06] husbands, and how our elders should be
[1:24:08] an example onto our sons, how to how to
[1:24:12] carry themselves with the right spirit
[1:24:14] and the right attitude. Now the problem
[1:24:16] is is when Amen. is when the the elders
[1:24:19] don't set the right example and and then
[1:24:22] the young people suffer and then it
[1:24:24] begins to pass down. Amen. But I thank
[1:24:26] God that you have a church here with
[1:24:28] some wonderful elders. Amen. A wonderful
[1:24:31] sister Brown, wonderful deacons. Amen.
[1:24:34] Amen. That are setting an example. Amen.
[1:24:37] For what a true son or daughter of God
[1:24:39] can actually look like. Amen. Because
[1:24:42] brother Brandham said, "This world is
[1:24:44] looking for a display of gallant
[1:24:46] soldiers of the cross, real heroes that
[1:24:49] will stand for God." And right. And I
[1:24:52] think it's a pitiful thing. Amen. When
[1:24:54] the young people have to be an example
[1:24:57] for the elders, Amen. Because Amen.
[1:25:00] Because Amen. A mama, amen, doesn't
[1:25:03] respect her husband or a mama doesn't
[1:25:06] Amen. show any respect. Amen. And
[1:25:09] doesn't honor the head of her house. And
[1:25:11] then the daughter grows up and does the
[1:25:13] same thing. And you wonder why. Amen.
[1:25:15] Because that was the only example they
[1:25:17] saw. Amen. But thank God for some real
[1:25:21] mothers. Thank God for some real sons
[1:25:24] and daughters of God. Amen. Is that you
[1:25:26] tonight? Amen. Some real sons and
[1:25:28] daughters of God that will stand for the
[1:25:31] truth. Amen. Amen. Because the whole
[1:25:34] earth is groaning for the manifestation
[1:25:37] of sons of God. Amen. Sons of God, amen,
[1:25:41] to to stand and manifest. Amen. Christ
[1:25:45] in this hour waiting for the
[1:25:47] manifestation of sons of God. Amen. Just
[1:25:51] like those sons of Levi would stand in
[1:25:53] that day, they're sons and daughters of
[1:25:55] God in this day that'll say, "I'll stand
[1:25:57] for what's right."
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and what I'm trying to get to
[1:26:02] you is that we have an opportunity to do
[1:26:04] it. And we we want to seize our
[1:26:07] opportunity.
[1:26:08] Amen. We want to seize our opportunity.
[1:26:11] Amen. To stand for the greatest message
[1:26:14] that's ever hit the face of this earth.
[1:26:16] Amen. What do we want to be known for?
[1:26:19] Amen. What do we want to be known for
[1:26:20] when we leave this earth? Amen. Do we
[1:26:23] want to be known just for a just a
[1:26:25] halfway? Or do we want to be known for
[1:26:28] somebody that gave their all to the
[1:26:31] message of the hour?
[1:26:33] I say, "Help me, Lord."
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we begin to turn a corner to
[1:26:39] draw it down here to a close,
[1:26:42] I think about David's mighty man [sighs]
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; that would stand for him in that hour
[1:26:48] and say, "If the king has a desire,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; amen, then his least desire is my
[1:26:54] command."
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would talk about how
[1:26:58] we ministers today see this word is
[1:27:00] preached, to see that it's done. And
[1:27:02] it's becoming to us a man in these hour
[1:27:04] that we're living in. Great men in the
[1:27:06] earth today. Oh God, they're out there.
[1:27:08] Let them see it and grab the sword. No
[1:27:10] matter what the opposition of God before
[1:27:12] you, who can be against you? We don't
[1:27:14] care jeopardizing our social living. We
[1:27:17] don't care jeopardizing this, that, or
[1:27:19] the other. We want to get the water of
[1:27:21] life back. Amen. Have you ever got to
[1:27:24] that place in your life where you just
[1:27:26] say, "I don't care anymore what the
[1:27:29] world thinks about me. I don't care
[1:27:30] anymore." Amen. Amen. I'm just I I'm
[1:27:32] just being real tonight. Amen. Sometimes
[1:27:35] you feel like at least I've been there,
[1:27:37] Lord. I feel like I should have said
[1:27:39] something. I feel like I'm not a good
[1:27:40] witness. I feel like I should have done
[1:27:42] more for you. I feel like I get so
[1:27:45] worried maybe about saying the wrong
[1:27:46] thing or this or that. But sometimes you
[1:27:48] just get to that point and say, "I I
[1:27:50] don't I don't care anymore, Lord. I just
[1:27:53] want to stand for you. I I don't care if
[1:27:55] they laugh at me. I don't care if they
[1:27:57] make fun of me. I I don't care anymore,
[1:27:59] Lord. If there's only one person that's
[1:28:01] welcome in the room, I want it to be
[1:28:04] you. Lord, I I don't care anymore about
[1:28:06] if I if it makes someone else
[1:28:08] uncomfortable. Lord, I want to make you
[1:28:10] welcome. I want to worship you. I want
[1:28:12] to make you welcome. Amen. Brother
[1:28:14] Andrew Glover preached on it one time. I
[1:28:16] think someone told him, he said, "You
[1:28:18] see that person walking down the street
[1:28:20] and dressed, Amen, like you know, maybe
[1:28:22] they in their pajamas or this or that."
[1:28:24] And he said, "Those are called don't
[1:28:26] care no mores." [laughter]
[1:28:28] Amen. because they just don't care
[1:28:30] anymore. Amen. So they'll walk out and
[1:28:32] dressed however they want to. Amen.
[1:28:34] Because they've just come to a spot they
[1:28:36] don't care what everyone thinks
[1:28:37] apparently. Amen. And he began to type
[1:28:40] that to the spiritual that you can come
[1:28:42] to that place where you become a don't
[1:28:44] care no more. Amen. Don't care what the
[1:28:47] world thinks no more. Don't care what
[1:28:49] your schoolmates think anymore. Don't
[1:28:51] care what your co-workers think anymore.
[1:28:54] Amen. But something begins to rise up in
[1:28:56] your heart. Say Lord. Amen. If you're
[1:28:58] sitting in the room with dirty feet, I'm
[1:29:01] not going to let you stay here with
[1:29:03] dirty feet, but I'm going to wash your
[1:29:05] feet with my praise. I'm going to water
[1:29:08] you, Lord. Simon the Pharisee and all of
[1:29:10] his friends are trying to dirty your
[1:29:12] reputation. Amen. But this might be my
[1:29:15] only opportunity in your presence. AND
[1:29:17] I'VE GOT A NEED. I'VE GOT A SINS in my
[1:29:20] life. So Lord, I don't care what Simon
[1:29:23] thinks. I don't care, Amen, what the
[1:29:25] people of my past life think. Lord, if
[1:29:28] you are here with dirty feet, I'm going
[1:29:30] to get out my hair and I'm going to wash
[1:29:33] your feet and I'm going to wipe it with
[1:29:35] my glory. Amen. Because Jesus reputation
[1:29:38] is made in the presence of sinners.
[1:29:41] Amen. That'll recognize them and worship
[1:29:43] them and say, "I don't care anymore.
[1:29:46] I've got a need. I've got a need." And
[1:29:49] Jesus would cry back out, "Your sins
[1:29:51] which were many are all forgiven you."
[1:29:54] Amen. Because somebody took sides with
[1:29:57] Jesus. Amen. And he would speak of that
[1:29:59] blind man. Amen. They were trying to
[1:30:02] dirty Jesus' name saying, "Who sinned?
[1:30:05] You or your parents?" Amen. That you
[1:30:07] were born blind. And say, "Neither, but
[1:30:09] that the works of God be made manifest.
[1:30:12] And I may not be able to explain to you
[1:30:14] how he did it." Amen. But all I know is
[1:30:17] my eyes. which were once closed are now
[1:30:19] open. One thing I know, where once I was
[1:30:23] blind, now I can see. Amen. If they want
[1:30:26] to dirty the reputation of this message,
[1:30:29] Amen. I say you're going to have to
[1:30:31] Amen. Get out of the way for one voice.
[1:30:33] Amen. Because this is one voice that
[1:30:35] says one thing I know. Where once I was
[1:30:38] lost, now I am saved. Where once I was
[1:30:40] bound, now I'm delivered. Well, once I
[1:30:43] was in a cloud of confusion, now I'm
[1:30:46] walking in the clarity of the vindicated
[1:30:48] word. Amen. Because of this message.
[1:30:51] Amen. I'll take sides with the message
[1:30:53] of the hour
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; because it becometh you to fulfill all
[1:30:57] righteousness. It's becoming of you to
[1:31:00] take a stand. Amen. That's what brother
[1:31:02] Brandon would preach. It becometh us to
[1:31:04] fulfill all righteousness. And he would
[1:31:06] preach about how Abraham stood and about
[1:31:09] how Elijah stood and about how all these
[1:31:12] characters in the Bible stood.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, Abraham stood when the devil was
[1:31:18] trying to destroy. And God had told him,
[1:31:20] "Go take your son and and take him up on
[1:31:23] the mountain and sacrifice him." And
[1:31:26] Moses or Abraham was obedient because it
[1:31:29] becometh him to fulfill our
[1:31:31] righteousness. Amen. But we serve a God
[1:31:34] that can stay the hand. Amen. Because
[1:31:38] you're obedient to his word. When it
[1:31:41] looks like judgment is just about to
[1:31:43] strike your daughter or your son. Amen.
[1:31:46] But you are fulfilling all
[1:31:47] righteousness. We serve a God that can
[1:31:49] stay the hand. Say, "It don't look good,
[1:31:51] Brother Isaac. It looks like it looks
[1:31:53] like judgment's about to strike. It
[1:31:55] looks like this is about to happen. just
[1:31:57] keep standing for righteousness and we
[1:31:59] serve a God that can stay the hand of
[1:32:03] what looks like it's going to destroy
[1:32:06] [gasps]
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; because you know when brother Brandon
[1:32:08] preached that message he was standing in
[1:32:11] the pulpit and he walks up and says it's
[1:32:14] always a pleasure to come to the house
[1:32:15] of God brother Paul but this might be
[1:32:17] one of the hardest times my mother's
[1:32:20] laying dying in the hospital and in the
[1:32:23] middle of a sermon they bring him a note
[1:32:25] said don't look good. It looks like she
[1:32:28] may be gone. But [snorts] then he would
[1:32:30] say, "But it becometh me now to fulfill
[1:32:32] all righteousness." And he stood there
[1:32:35] and preached the message to me and to
[1:32:37] you. Amen. Because in the midst of
[1:32:39] opposition, it was becoming to him to
[1:32:42] take a stand. He said, "The devil's
[1:32:44] tried to push me out of this pulpit the
[1:32:46] whole service." Amen. But it becometh me
[1:32:48] to fulfill all righteousness. But you
[1:32:51] know what happened when brother Brandham
[1:32:53] stood for the Lord? He came back and
[1:32:55] preached the comforter that evening and
[1:32:57] he said, "Amen, she don't know it, but
[1:33:00] Jesus was keeping her alive while I was
[1:33:03] preaching." Amen. Because when you stand
[1:33:05] for Jesus, Amen, he will stand for you.
[1:33:09] Amen. It becometh us to fulfill our
[1:33:11] righteousness and take sides with Jesus.
[1:33:13] But let me tell you this, if you take
[1:33:15] sides with him and he is right there to
[1:33:18] take sides with you,
[1:33:21] oh my
[1:33:24] Because [snorts] when the children of
[1:33:25] Israel took a stood stand for him and
[1:33:28] did not bow, amen to that to that idol.
[1:33:31] Amen. Nebuchadnezzar would say, "All
[1:33:33] right, then you got to go into the fiery
[1:33:35] furnace." But they took a stand.
[1:33:39] Amen.
[1:33:41] A a and right at the last hour, they
[1:33:43] said, "I see a fourth man in the fire,
[1:33:46] one like unto the son of God." And you
[1:33:49] know what it says in the book of Daniel?
[1:33:52] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, "Blessed
[1:33:54] be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:33:56] Abedneo, who has sent his angel and
[1:33:58] delivered his servants that trusted in
[1:34:00] him, and have changed the king's word
[1:34:03] and yielded their bodies, that they
[1:34:05] might not serve nor worship any god
[1:34:06] except their own god." And he said,
[1:34:08] "Therefore, I make a decree. every
[1:34:10] people, nation, language would speak
[1:34:12] anything a miss against the God of
[1:34:14] Shadrach, Meach, and Abedneo shall be
[1:34:17] cut to pieces, and their houses shall be
[1:34:20] made a dungghill because there's no
[1:34:22] other god that can deliver after this
[1:34:24] sort. Then the king promoted Shadrach,
[1:34:27] Mach, and Abedneo in the province of
[1:34:30] Babylon. Brother Brandon said, "If you
[1:34:32] stand for the word, it always pays out
[1:34:35] wonderful."
[1:34:37] You know, the same thing happened for
[1:34:38] Daniel when he wouldn't bow and there's
[1:34:41] a decree. You cannot pray to any other
[1:34:43] deity except the king. But Daniel kneel
[1:34:46] down and prayed three times a day just
[1:34:48] like always. And they said, "You made
[1:34:50] the decree, king. He's got to go in the
[1:34:52] lion's den." And they cast him in the
[1:34:54] lion's den. Amen. But the pillar fire
[1:34:58] was in there with him. Stay in the mouth
[1:35:00] of those lions. And when he came back up
[1:35:02] out of that den, the king made another
[1:35:05] decree and said, "How how I make a
[1:35:08] decree that in every dominion of my
[1:35:10] kingdom, men tremble in fear before the
[1:35:12] God of Daniel, for he is the living God,
[1:35:15] steadfast forever, and his kingdom that
[1:35:18] which shall not be destroyed, and his
[1:35:19] dominion shall be even unto the end. He
[1:35:22] deliverth and rescueth, and he workketh
[1:35:24] signs and wonders in heaven and earth.
[1:35:26] Who hath delivered Daniel from the power
[1:35:28] of the lions? And Daniel prospered in
[1:35:31] the reign of Darius.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say sometimes it feels like it's
[1:35:36] just much easier to bow, amen, to the
[1:35:38] pressures. But I say it's much easier to
[1:35:41] stand
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; because it always pays off when you
[1:35:45] stand.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. With the musicians come tonight.
[1:35:51] When brother Bram said, "I'm so glad
[1:35:54] that I'm on the winning side.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I follow the lamb
[1:35:58] because it said the lamb overcame them
[1:36:00] for he was king of kings and lord of
[1:36:03] lords."
[1:36:04] And he said farther down, "I trust that
[1:36:06] you'll make the decision that you'll
[1:36:08] follow the lamb."
[1:36:10] You know, and brother Aaron, when a
[1:36:13] basketball team wins a national
[1:36:14] championship or football team, all of
[1:36:17] that team, even the ones that sat on the
[1:36:19] bench, they get that they get that
[1:36:21] championship ring.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they might not have played a
[1:36:26] second and they might not be able to
[1:36:28] dribble their way out of a paper bag,
[1:36:30] but because of whose side they were on,
[1:36:33] amen, they all get to celebrate in the
[1:36:35] championship.
[1:36:37] Amen. And I begin to think about that
[1:36:38] today, I think, or yesterday. I my
[1:36:42] because Satan might try to offer you,
[1:36:44] well, if you just go to this team,
[1:36:46] you'll get you'll get more playing time
[1:36:47] and you'll get this or that. Amen. But
[1:36:50] but but Michael Jordan's not on that
[1:36:52] team. And sure, you might get to play
[1:36:55] more, but you'll just have loss after
[1:36:57] loss after loss.
[1:36:59] Amen. That Amen. Are you get what I'm
[1:37:00] saying tonight? Amen. It matters whose
[1:37:03] side you're on. And when you take sides
[1:37:06] with Jesus, you're on the winning side.
[1:37:09] And brother Brandham said, Amen. Brother
[1:37:11] Brandham said that here he has for when
[1:37:15] the scripture says in the book of
[1:37:16] Revelations, these things, these things
[1:37:19] saith the amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Now we can see why
[1:37:23] the devil hates the book of Genesis and
[1:37:25] Revelation. He hates the truth. He knows
[1:37:27] the truth will prevail. He knows what
[1:37:29] his end will be, how he fights that. But
[1:37:32] we are on the winning side. We I mean
[1:37:34] the believers of his word only are on
[1:37:37] the amen side.
[1:37:40] Amen. You say, "Brother Isaac, will will
[1:37:42] I be popular?" No, you might not be, but
[1:37:44] you'll be blessed.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd rather be blessed of God.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Than ever blessed with anything
[1:37:51] this world has to offer.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says,
[1:37:58] "Consecrate yourselves today to the
[1:38:00] Lord, every man upon his son and his
[1:38:02] brother, that ye may bestow upon you a
[1:38:04] blessing this day." He said in in the
[1:38:08] book of Exodus 23, "They shall not if
[1:38:10] thou shalt not bow down to their gods,
[1:38:12] nor serve them, nor do after their
[1:38:14] works, but thou shalt utterly overthrow
[1:38:15] them and quite break down their images.
[1:38:17] and ye shall serve the Lord thy God, and
[1:38:19] he shall bless thy bread and thy water,
[1:38:22] and take sickness away from the midst of
[1:38:24] thee. Brother Brandon would teach us
[1:38:28] that that iniquity would be passed down
[1:38:31] to the third and fourth generation.
[1:38:34] I mean, but he would say, "If that's
[1:38:36] true for iniquity, it's also true for
[1:38:38] blessings."
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I mean, and you think, "My stand doesn't
[1:38:42] matter, brother Isaac. What what
[1:38:43] difference will it make if I stand?"
[1:38:45] Well, when Abraham stood and paid tithe
[1:38:49] to Melzdc,
[1:38:51] the Bible says that Levi paid tithes to
[1:38:53] Melzdc and the loins of Abraham with his
[1:38:58] great our great greatgrandfather.
[1:39:00] And brother Bram said that the example
[1:39:02] that you set and the the decisions that
[1:39:05] you make will affect your children and
[1:39:07] your children's children and down the
[1:39:09] line because it's not just iniquity
[1:39:11] that's passed down. It's blessings. And
[1:39:15] there when those Levites stood for the
[1:39:17] word, they had paid tithes to MelzDC and
[1:39:19] the loins of Abraham. But now when they
[1:39:21] took that stand for the word, they went
[1:39:23] into the temple. Amen. And all the all
[1:39:26] the other people would have to bring
[1:39:27] tithes onto them and take care of them
[1:39:29] while they would serve the Lord as
[1:39:31] priests in the temple. Amen. Because you
[1:39:34] look at the blessing on those that have
[1:39:36] stood for the word.
[1:39:39] Amen. You say, "Well, well, well, I come
[1:39:41] from a family of of broken pieces."
[1:39:43] says, "Well, you can be the first one in
[1:39:45] your family to take the stand." And your
[1:39:48] spiritual fathers have took a stand.
[1:39:50] Maybe your natural lineage hasn't, but
[1:39:52] your spiritual lineage has took a stand.
[1:39:55] And and and and I want it to be very
[1:39:59] very clear and very very strong
[1:40:02] that if you stand for him, he'll stand
[1:40:05] for you.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Anything that you forsake for this
[1:40:08] gospel, Amen. The Bible says how you how
[1:40:12] he will repay you a thousandfold.
[1:40:16] Brother Brandon would say, "Everything
[1:40:18] that you've forsaken for this gospel,
[1:40:20] you've left houses and fathers and
[1:40:22] mothers and lands." He said, "He will
[1:40:24] repay you a thousandfold."
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I like that because one time
[1:40:29] Hadtie Wright put her voice with this
[1:40:31] message and said that's nothing but the
[1:40:33] truth. And you know what brother Bram
[1:40:35] said? He said the blessings has never
[1:40:37] left that house. Amen.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; He said it's it's not the same home
[1:40:41] anymore. A mean because somebody was
[1:40:44] willing to take their stand with this
[1:40:46] word. Amen. And look at the blessings
[1:40:49] that affected their home, affected their
[1:40:52] children.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you stand on your feet with me
[1:40:55] tonight.
[1:41:01] Amen.
[1:41:03] If we could just bow our heads in a word
[1:41:05] of prayer as we just close. Forgive me
[1:41:07] for
[1:41:09] holding you here.
[1:41:11] But but in the Bible, there was a valley
[1:41:14] one time called the valley of I where
[1:41:18] Joshua was fighting a battle and they
[1:41:21] suffered a great defeat. And they begin
[1:41:23] to search out why is this that I've
[1:41:25] suffered this defeat
[1:41:27] and they found Achen had robbed the camp
[1:41:30] of a wedge of gold and this and that.
[1:41:35] And and brother Wayne brought this out
[1:41:36] one time. It's so powerful because
[1:41:40] you can look at that scripture as
[1:41:42] judgment
[1:41:44] or you can look at it as opportunity
[1:41:47] because when they would stone Achen in
[1:41:49] the valley of Acor and go back to the
[1:41:52] valley of I and fight those armies
[1:41:56] again, they would win a great astounding
[1:42:00] victory.
[1:42:01] I mean, because it wasn't that, well, I
[1:42:03] just I've made a mistake, Brother Isaac.
[1:42:05] I how can I be a Levite? How can I take
[1:42:07] a stand for this message? I I've
[1:42:12] just comes to my mind now, you know,
[1:42:13] Peter before he had the Holy Ghost
[1:42:15] denied him three times.
[1:42:18] Amen. But when they took care of the sin
[1:42:20] in the camp, [music] then they could
[1:42:22] rise again and suffer victory after
[1:42:24] victory after victory. Samson committed
[1:42:28] sins with Delilah. Amen. But when he was
[1:42:31] ready to forsake everything and die out,
[1:42:33] he'd say, "Just once more, Lord. I'm
[1:42:36] ready to take my stand. I've made some
[1:42:39] mistakes. I've committed some sins, but
[1:42:41] Lord, I'm ready to say just once more,
[1:42:44] Lord. I want to stand for you
[1:42:47] that you might stand for me." Amen. If
[1:42:50] that's you tonight, if we bow our heads
[1:42:52] and close our eyes, if I know it's
[1:42:55] chopped up tonight, forgive me. just
[1:42:57] trying to bring it out. But maybe you'd
[1:42:59] like to take a stand for him. Like
[1:43:02] brother Brandham tells about that
[1:43:03] evangelist Daniel Curry. I mean that
[1:43:06] went before that throne and thought
[1:43:08] surely he would make it in.
[1:43:11] And we say, "Hey man, your name's not on
[1:43:13] the book. We're going to have to take it
[1:43:14] to the white throne." And before that
[1:43:16] white throne,
[1:43:18] every little white lie, every little
[1:43:20] thing that he had told was a great big
[1:43:22] lie.
[1:43:24] And he was guilty. And just when he
[1:43:27] thought that he was going to be
[1:43:28] condemned to judgment, a voice spoke out
[1:43:30] and said, "Wait a minute. Daniel Curry
[1:43:32] stood for me when he was on earth. I
[1:43:35] want to stand for him now. Put his sins
[1:43:37] on my charge."
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Oh. And when Daniel Curry stood for
[1:43:42] Jesus,
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus stood for Daniel Curry.
[1:43:46] Amen. And that's what we're trying to
[1:43:48] say tonight. If you take a stand for
[1:43:50] this message, it may be difficult.
[1:43:55] Amen. You may have to bear reproach and
[1:43:57] suffer and be persecuted and laughed at,
[1:43:59] but if you stand for him, he'll stand
[1:44:01] for you.
[1:44:03] Heavenly Father, we commit this
[1:44:05] congregation into your hands, Lord.
[1:44:07] Forgive me, I pray for my humanity,
[1:44:09] Father. And but Lord, I just just
[1:44:12] [music]
[1:44:13] on my heart, Father, my what a privilege
[1:44:16] it is to be able to stand for you in
[1:44:18] this hour, Father. We don't. Lord,
[1:44:21] sometimes it rebukes us. But Father, I
[1:44:24] thank you that it rebukes us, Lord. I
[1:44:26] Lord, I personally I want to thank you,
[1:44:29] Lord, for a word that doesn't let us
[1:44:32] stay where we're at, but it molds us and
[1:44:34] shapes us into your image, Father. I
[1:44:37] want to thank you, Lord. Even just
[1:44:38] reading some of these quotes the other
[1:44:40] night, Father, I Lord, I was so
[1:44:43] convicted, my Lord, because I feel like
[1:44:45] I've failed you so many times. I I feel
[1:44:48] like there's times when I haven't stood
[1:44:50] for you like I should. I Lord, I haven't
[1:44:53] uh at work, Lord. I I should be a better
[1:44:56] witness. I should do this and I should
[1:44:57] do that. And I say, Lord, help me to be
[1:45:00] a better witness. Father, Lord, I Lord,
[1:45:03] if I have to fail, Lord, let me fail,
[1:45:05] but let me rise and try again. Lord, if
[1:45:08] I'm if I need to make some mistakes,
[1:45:10] Lord, I'd rather wear out than rust out,
[1:45:13] as the prophet would said. But Lord, I
[1:45:14] want to be found standing for you.
[1:45:16] Father, Lord, forgive me for all the
[1:45:19] times, Lord, I failed you. But Father,
[1:45:23] I do know this thing, Lord Jesus, that
[1:45:26] by your grace, we've put our life under
[1:45:29] this message of the hour.
[1:45:32] Lord, it's our headship. Father,
[1:45:35] we've taken sides with you and
[1:45:36] everything else contrary is wrong. And I
[1:45:39] pray that you bless your children
[1:45:40] tonight.
[1:45:42] May you bless this assembly as they
[1:45:43] stand for you, Lord.
[1:45:46] I believe you'll stand for them, Father.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; In your precious name we pray. Amen.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead, brother Paul.
[1:45:58] [singing]
[1:46:01] I'm going all the way.
[1:46:05] Yes. [singing]
[1:46:06] All
