[15:56] easily
[15:59] Jesus keeps her
[16:06] see Zuri
[16:08] let's see Jesus keeps homey
[16:18] I appreciate that tonight amen
[16:30] you know there's nothing like a song
[16:32] when a song sung by experienced Amen
[16:36] because when you think God gave the song
[16:40] he gave the song to the rider by an
[16:43] inspiration of an experience they went
[16:45] through you know this many of the things
[16:51] that I've just been studying over the
[16:53] different times here and it was probably
[16:55] from a few months ago but you know when
[16:58] you study some of you I know have
[16:59] studied some of the writers of hymns and
[17:04] when you get into looking at them it to
[17:06] me it's things that just astound me you
[17:09] read it and you cry it touches your life
[17:13] like a song that we know so well hold to
[17:16] God's unchanging hand that song itself
[17:19] when it was wrote he was wrote by a
[17:21] person if I have everything I've got the
[17:23] story here and one of my notes but it
[17:26] was written by a person who had suffered
[17:27] a spinal accident when they were just
[17:30] about in their teens but then they began
[17:34] they wrote wrote this song and they
[17:36] didn't realize what it would turn out to
[17:37] be it ended up being in a Sunday School
[17:40] literature then they realized oh my this
[17:42] is this song was in there you know they
[17:45] never did it for anything of money it
[17:46] was just an experience and one thing
[17:48] about this writer when they wrote that
[17:50] song hold to God's unchanging hand and
[17:53] how that God had so moved in their life
[17:55] they had a situation in their life that
[17:57] it's so interrupted them to where from
[17:59] that moment on they were bound within a
[18:02] chair because of the spinal condition
[18:05] but one of the things we're saying I
[18:06] thought was so interesting is that they
[18:08] said in all of the countless hymns that
[18:10] this sister wrote she never once let her
[18:15] infirmities be projected in any songs
[18:18] that's powerful that's powerful all that
[18:21] she suffered she never allowed it to be
[18:23] projected in songs but she always wrote
[18:26] by inserting inspiration hold to God's
[18:28] changing in many other songs that she
[18:30] wrote but when you look at that I looked
[18:32] at that I'll tell you just you know you
[18:34] think about if you read I said Lord just
[18:36] the other day I said I'm gonna meet that
[18:38] sister I'm gonna meet her because I
[18:41] believe she's one of the elect of God
[18:43] amen a rugged believer who could stand
[18:45] in an hour I'm we're gonna meet her so
[18:48] there's an experience from that comes
[18:49] from those songs and we just thank God
[18:51] from that that it's truly he's given us
[18:53] strength to overcome our trials and that
[18:56] wonderful it's so real in our lives it's
[18:59] him amen we just have some some requests
[19:03] to take before the Lord here tonight in
[19:05] prayer from brother Shane it says please
[19:07] pray for an old high-school buddy of
[19:09] mine his name is Danny Fortney and is

[21:21] rainbow babies hospital with a blood
[21:23] infection I know he's been admitted into
[21:26] the ICU when they woke up you you know
[21:31] the request he's been in and out of the
[21:33] hospital they have what's called a
[21:35] sister Anna told me today or this
[21:37] morning on the phone I can't remember
[21:39] the name of the disease but where he's
[21:42] been in and out of the hospital he's
[21:43] three years old and this morning when he
[21:45] woke up it was just blood that was just
[21:48] coming out so they're gonna have they're
[21:52] gonna have to do a blood transfusion and
[21:55] it's just been continuous for them and
[21:59] so we want to just hold them up in
[22:02] prayer because you know and as I was
[22:05] praying this morning I was talking to my
[22:07] sister Hannah it's already something
[22:10] that can be very fearful when you know
[22:13] the Lord as far as a condition like that
[22:17] be but then when you take that within
[22:20] the situation of someone who really
[22:22] doesn't know the Lord are you don't know
[22:25] where they stand with and I'm talking
[22:26] about the parents with that that's to me
[22:30] that would be very scary because it's
[22:33] one thing you know fear itself that it
[22:35] comes in different aspects of things and
[22:38] we look at some times because it's the
[22:40] conditions it's the uncertainty we do
[22:42] know that God has everything under
[22:44] control but sometimes it's just like
[22:46] where they've been through or others
[22:49] have been through you
[22:50] you get weary as you're continuing to
[22:52] tend to something and some of you that's
[22:54] been you've been through different
[22:55] things you know sometimes you just get
[22:57] weary and you need strength within it
[23:01] and you know sometimes you get good news
[23:03] and then you get bad news and then you
[23:05] get good news and so I know that we
[23:07] would be able to you know enter in for
[23:09] that for that little Zachary sister Anna
[23:12] Miranda's her great grandson so let's
[23:14] remember him in prayer as well as the
[23:17] the whole family there please continue
[23:21] to keep sister Linda cavillo
[23:22] in prayer she requests prayer for her
[23:25] son
[23:26] Pete he needs he needs the Lord in his
[23:30] life so you keep him in prayers I just
[23:32] got a text the other evening and asked
[23:35] that if I would call him so you keep
[23:38] would you keep him in prayer and just I
[23:40] don't know what what I know that God's
[23:42] the answer I know that the Lord is the
[23:44] answer for for the needs in his life and
[23:47] in and it will truly take the Lord to do
[23:51] that work so we just want to be mindful
[23:55] of that tonight that God will move
[23:56] because he needs the Lord in a very
[23:59] great way there's any other requests
