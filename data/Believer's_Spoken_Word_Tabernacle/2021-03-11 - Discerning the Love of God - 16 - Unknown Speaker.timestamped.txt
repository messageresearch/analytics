[38:49] we ask it now father for your glory
[38:52] in jesus name amen
[38:55] amen god bless you amen
[38:58] let's look here in the word
[39:02] i want to go we've been reading from
[39:04] this verse and taking just that part and
[39:07] in first corinthians 13 4
[39:11] perhaps by now you probably have
[39:13] committed it to memory but
[39:15] we certainly want it more than just
[39:17] memory
[39:18] and um sometimes there's things that you
[39:20] look in a verse of scripture and
[39:23] um you know i just is telling the lord
[39:25] today
[39:26] there's things that you know you witness
[39:28] over the years but
[39:29] it's still you stand as a marvel of god
[39:32] will take something and it begins to
[39:34] unpack it
[39:35] and it's all of the whole the whole part
[39:37] of the ministering of the word
[39:39] it's all about what god coming and
[39:42] ministering to what we have need of
[39:45] there's many times we see things even as
[39:47] a as a minister
[39:49] we don't know what the needs are and
[39:51] even when you would know a need
[39:52] such as myself being the pastor here but
[39:56] yet
[39:56] as far as within that i can't reach out
[39:58] i just can't reach out within myself to
[40:00] meet that it takes god to come and meet
[40:02] him
[40:03] and god works in such a way that there
[40:05] are times that
[40:06] something doesn't even have to be said
[40:08] directly he just comes
[40:11] when he comes that's that's the most
[40:13] important thing
[40:14] amen so let's read here and then we'll
[40:17] just allow you to be seated
[40:18] first corinthians 13 4 charity
[40:22] suffereth long is kind it envieth not
[40:26] and it vaunteth not itself it's not
[40:30] puffed up
[40:31] may god bless you bless the reading of
[40:32] the word as you're being seated
[40:36] i want to just look here in a part
[40:39] when we just some of the things that
[40:41] some time ago
[40:43] that when the lord just began to deal
[40:46] with my heart um just looking on on some
[40:50] of these
[40:51] parts and really begin to take this on
[40:52] the on the vaunted
[40:54] knot and begin to look at this word
[40:57] because of what it really it means it
[41:00] deals with that charity is not
[41:02] boastful that word just began to press
[41:05] upon my heart
[41:06] one sunday evening and just started to
[41:08] begin to look at some things and
[41:10] and these are the parts sometimes we
[41:12] look at things that
[41:14] are before us and you know there's
[41:16] things sometimes that can be so
[41:18] sly or so subtle or things that can
[41:21] seemingly
[41:22] move under the radar a little bit but
[41:25] god
[41:26] is so mindful and he desires that the
[41:29] the image of his own life within us that
[41:32] our
[41:32] character would be molded to reflect
[41:36] his character now we know that character
[41:38] it's not a gift
[41:39] the holy ghost is the free gift of god
[41:43] that's something that that is it is
[41:45] gifted to you and i
[41:47] that life the quickening power but then
[41:49] when that
[41:50] life that character of life that has
[41:52] come into us
[41:53] then through that life being in us
[41:57] it now works to shape and to mold our
[42:00] character
[42:00] to where everything about us reflects
[42:04] him and of course we understand it it
[42:07] takes
[42:08] uh each and every day a dying daily to
[42:11] self
[42:12] and so we thank god for his grace that
[42:14] allows us to die
[42:16] to self we thank god that god brings
[42:18] things to our attention because
[42:20] the desires we've looked at here within
[42:22] any heart of a believer
[42:24] we want him to be glorified when we
[42:26] leave out of a
[42:27] restaurant or a job or wherever it's at
[42:30] we
[42:31] we would like it to be declared that a
[42:33] christian has been here
[42:35] that to have a reflection of that life
[42:37] not something we're trying to do
[42:39] but if the desire is that it would be
[42:42] that of
[42:43] christ that has been made known to them
[42:45] there's a
[42:46] difference and you know when we look at
[42:48] things
[42:49] one of the things that we'll look at
[42:50] here tonight and
[42:52] in looking at this little part it's
[42:54] something that
[42:56] at times when we can look at it that it
[42:58] may not be something that we could
[43:00] we would say out here as far as a boast
[43:04] or a glory but sometimes it's even in
[43:06] the way
[43:07] that we can approach things and when we
[43:10] look here in the scripture the scripture
[43:12] that i want to start with here is
[43:14] proverbs 27 verse 1
[43:16] and and here the admonition of the lord
[43:19] says
[43:20] boast not thyself of tomorrow
[43:23] for thou knowest not what a day
[43:27] may bring forth there's
[43:30] there's not one of us not one doesn't
[43:32] matter what age we are
[43:34] not one of us has the promise of
[43:36] tomorrow
[43:38] and you know let alone the next breath
[43:42] there and you know so when we look at
[43:44] this we we realize
[43:46] that it's not god has not called upon us
[43:50] to instruct him nor is he inquiring of
[43:53] us
[43:54] uh to see that we might direct him but
[43:57] rather as the scripture said who has
[44:00] known the mind of the lord
[44:02] that they may instruct him but it's not
[44:05] us
[44:05] instructing god but it's god instructing
[44:09] you and i
[44:10] it's the mind the mind of god the mind
[44:13] of christ
[44:14] it surpasses our natural mind as a
[44:16] matter of fact
[44:17] many times it will work in direct
[44:20] contrast
[44:21] to the natural mind because our natural
[44:24] mind
[44:24] is based upon things that you and i
[44:27] would have control on
[44:29] but the mind of christ god's mind
[44:32] operating in us
[44:33] is it looks and it brings us to focus
[44:36] on god and that he who has made a
[44:39] promise
[44:40] he fulfills his promise in his own time
[44:44] in his own season and he doesn't ask us
[44:47] to know
[44:47] how it's going to happen he doesn't even
[44:50] ask us
[44:51] to declare the wind it's just
[44:54] most important is is to know him who's
[44:57] made the promise
[44:58] and that we are in him who is the
[45:00] promised keeper
[45:02] and so it's the privilege that you and i
[45:05] have
[45:05] in our life this is a privilege that is
[45:08] the children of god
[45:10] that we can be led by the spirit of
[45:13] almighty god
[45:14] that's a great privilege that we have
[45:16] and you know brother branham would
[45:18] would speak of these things and these
[45:20] are some of these parts are very
[45:22] familiar with us as i said
[45:24] these are things that sometimes we can
[45:25] just somewhat look over
[45:27] not willfully but we just can kind of
[45:30] look over and brother branham's talking
[45:32] about he's made a commitment as far as
[45:34] to the church or
[45:35] he's told the church as you've heard him
[45:37] say many times
[45:38] i'm going to preach on on this subject
[45:41] if the lord
[45:41] allows me to do so and brother branham
[45:44] would put that in there
[45:45] and he said he began to just kind of
[45:47] study on this subject now this was back
[45:49] when he was just preaching the message
[45:51] on the seven church ages the one message
[45:54] back in 1954
[45:55] and he began to study and as he's
[45:57] looking at it
[45:58] he just finds and senses the spirit of
[46:01] god
[46:02] just draws near to his heart and and he
[46:05] begins says
[46:05] you know at that time he says i just was
[46:07] was getting happy and i just believe
[46:10] that it's god's will for me to bring
[46:12] this
[46:13] you see the scripture it always
[46:16] we always want to always rest and
[46:18] resolve in this place
[46:20] that if it be the will of the lord
[46:24] that's the best thing brother bram said
[46:25] that's the best thing that we
[46:28] can say you know i just say it to you
[46:30] like this
[46:31] as as a minister of the gospel there are
[46:34] things sometimes
[46:35] that even i've witnessed right here in
[46:37] the church let alone
[46:38] when i've been out in another place and
[46:40] going to minister
[46:42] that sometimes there's things that where
[46:44] god will take things that
[46:45] you might be inclined to speak in a
[46:48] certain thought a certain direction
[46:51] and then all of a sudden the holy spirit
[46:53] will begin to just
[46:54] move and just to deal with your heart
[46:56] and you know
[46:57] you're looking at things and well i i
[46:59] need i'm just going to follow this
[47:01] channel
[47:01] and you may not have one single note
[47:04] wrote down for it whatsoever
[47:06] but you know always reserve because
[47:08] after all
[47:09] uh i'm not the preacher he's the
[47:12] preacher
[47:14] i'm not the one who operates the gift he
[47:16] comes and operates the gift
[47:18] and you know there's a part of it that
[47:20] and let's just let me just be honest
[47:22] with you in the humanity of myself
[47:25] there's a comfort as far as where i can
[47:27] look out and say
[47:28] okay i'm moving within this direction
[47:30] i'm still relying on him
[47:32] but i i really get even more nervous i'm
[47:35] nervous anyhow but i get more nervous
[47:37] when i only have just a few scriptures
[47:39] and i'm standing there
[47:41] and i'm saying now where are we going to
[47:42] go with this lord
[47:44] what direction but you know the things
[47:46] that god and i'll say it in this way
[47:48] has taught me is to rely upon
[47:51] him and you know it doesn't take away
[47:54] with no matter what i have in front of
[47:56] me
[47:56] the reliance is upon him is that right
[48:00] it's just like as a song leader the
[48:02] psalm the brothers that stand up here
[48:04] they might have 10 songs on their list
[48:06] that doesn't mean that god
[48:07] wants them to sing all 10 songs on their
[48:09] list if
[48:11] i preached everything in my notes right
[48:12] here well i can't even tell you how many
[48:15] pages are here
[48:16] you we would be here throughout the
[48:17] whole month with no rest whatsoever
[48:20] but it's finding that particular the
[48:22] channel of almighty god
[48:24] and recognizing okay let's get off right
[48:26] here let's stop right here and
[48:28] you know it's so it's always to be
[48:30] mindful and
[48:31] always open to what the will of god is
[48:34] because after all
[48:36] it's not him fitting into our program
[48:38] but rather it's us fitting into his
[48:40] program
[48:42] so this is where the same scripture now
[48:45] james picks this up in reference here in
[48:48] james chapter 4 he says
[48:50] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[48:54] we will go into such a city
[48:56] and continue their year and buy and sell
[48:59] and get game
[49:01] whereas you know not what shall be on
[49:04] the morrow
[49:05] for what is your life it is even
[49:08] a vapor that appeareth for a little time
[49:11] then vanisheth away i think one of the
[49:14] clearest pictures of that is when a jet
[49:16] passes over and you see that jet stream
[49:18] you can stare at it and eventually it
[49:20] just
[49:20] it dissipates it goes away that's the
[49:22] same way with our lie
[49:24] it's very strong in the early years and
[49:27] then it just starts to
[49:28] fade away is that right so now it says
[49:32] it is what is your life it is even a
[49:34] vapor that appeareth for a little time
[49:36] and then vanisheth the way for that ye
[49:39] ought to say if the lord will
[49:43] we shall live and do this or that
[49:46] but now ye rejoice in your boastings
[49:50] and all such rejoicing is evil
[49:53] now when you think of this we wouldn't
[49:56] necessarily
[49:57] think that this is a boasting or
[50:00] it's a it's an evil rejoicing but when
[50:03] you look at the scripture on this
[50:05] and then and the meaning of this word
[50:07] boasting it means to be empty
[50:09] a braggart talk and insolent and empty
[50:13] assurance
[50:14] which trust in its own power and
[50:17] resources
[50:22] let me go to the next one this is the
[50:24] other part of it
[50:25] and in pious and empty you notice how
[50:28] that word empty is there
[50:29] an empty presumption a presumption is
[50:33] venturing without authority
[50:37] so it's an implies an empty presumption
[50:39] which trust
[50:40] in the stability of earthly things oh my
[50:44] lord
[50:46] certainly this these are things now that
[50:49] you would think would be
[50:50] ever so clear before people that don't
[50:53] put
[50:54] your stock in tomorrow
[51:00] that's not a play on words either but
[51:02] it's a reality
[51:03] you you make good of the day and the
[51:06] opportunity
[51:07] that you have today because we can't
[51:11] count on tomorrow
[51:13] is that right so the first words the
[51:15] first times when we
[51:17] think of this notice james says you you
[51:19] should say
[51:20] if the lord wills it wasn't saying if
[51:23] james was not
[51:24] telling them do not say as though you're
[51:27] going
[51:27] oh i'm gonna i'm not gonna go to this
[51:29] city. no but he says
[51:31] put god first lord
[51:35] willing amen if the lord
[51:38] wills this is what we will do
[51:42] the very first time that even this
[51:44] phrase is used
[51:46] i will is when god speaks that he's
[51:49] going
[51:50] to make a helpmate for adam
[51:53] it's where she would come forth under
[51:55] the i will you see
[51:57] with god there's no hesitation because
[52:00] you see we're not we are not god but he
[52:04] is the omniscient one he's omnipresent
[52:08] his omnipotent one and what he says
[52:11] he's the one that can say i will because
[52:14] he
[52:15] is the performer of his word
[52:18] and this is where we find a rest is
[52:21] is in that part of the word when god has
[52:24] said i will
[52:25] if we are found in that word of the i
[52:28] will
[52:29] we have complete rest and our future
[52:32] is clear it's certain because it's in
[52:35] him
[52:39] lucifer also took these words
[52:42] in isaiah 14 and he said i will
[52:46] ascend to the throne i will exalt myself
[52:51] i will be worshipped as god i will
[52:56] but satan he took that apart
[53:00] from god's will it was not one
[53:04] with god's will so it shows very clearly
[53:07] that anything that is not under
[53:11] god's will under his direction and not
[53:14] yielded to it
[53:15] is not of god
[53:19] it must be under his direction and this
[53:22] is what
[53:22] charity seeks for is that for
[53:26] his leading because no matter what it is
[53:28] that you and i
[53:30] would even maybe desire to do
[53:33] the thing that we want to see glorified
[53:35] is him
[53:37] now sometimes that that that the
[53:39] glorifying of him
[53:40] it would not be something so much that
[53:42] maybe somebody would see out here
[53:44] it can simply be that as we have waited
[53:47] on god
[53:48] and god has has guided us in a direction
[53:50] where we didn't know where to go
[53:52] but now here he comes on the scene and
[53:55] what a decision
[53:56] we were going to make he steps in the
[53:58] way
[53:59] and guides us so that our life is not
[54:01] entangled
[54:02] and not ensnared that his glory might
[54:05] continue to be reflected through our
[54:06] life
[54:07] this is why paul would say stand fast in
[54:10] the liberty wherewith christ had made
[54:11] you free
[54:12] he would say in timothy he said no good
[54:14] soldier
[54:15] entangleth himself with the affairs of
[54:18] this life
[54:19] that he may please him that had called
[54:21] him to be a soldier
[54:23] so that god entrusts that to you and i
[54:25] that those are decisions
[54:26] that we have to make
[54:30] and certainly god doesn't want you and i
[54:32] walking around fearful
[54:35] he doesn't want us walking around
[54:36] fearful like oh i might step on a trap
[54:38] here or i make
[54:39] no no god doesn't want us walking that
[54:41] way the matter of fact as we look at it
[54:43] here in just a moment
[54:44] as we see through the word when we're
[54:46] looking to him
[54:48] god sees to it that our footsteps are
[54:50] ordered in the right
[54:52] things i would love to be able to say
[54:55] that every one of us have made the
[54:57] perfect decisions in the past
[54:59] and will make the perfect decisions in
[55:01] the future but i i think
[55:03] that we're all resolved to this place
[55:04] not as an excuse but we're still walking
[55:07] in this humanity
[55:08] that we have to bring subject to the
[55:10] word day by day
[55:12] and moment by moment
[55:15] hallelujah now look how jeremiah would
[55:18] write this
[55:19] oh lord i know that the way of man is
[55:22] not in himself
[55:23] it is not in man that walketh to direct
[55:25] his steps
[55:28] so jeremiah is not speaking of
[55:31] as far as you or i would say well you
[55:34] know a man's a man a woman's a woman and
[55:36] they just you know know to go about
[55:38] their way he's speaking on a much higher
[55:40] level
[55:41] there was a fall that took place in eden
[55:44] and man who was made to be as a god
[55:48] remember when he fell and a man who is
[55:50] in a fallen condition
[55:52] is just like a beast
[55:55] so the way of man man doesn't hold it
[55:59] the way of man god's purpose the purpose
[56:02] the reason the desire
[56:04] that lays in god's hands it's not given
[56:07] to man
[56:07] but man thinks he knows what man should
[56:10] do
[56:11] but the way of man is not in himself
[56:14] to direct himself it is it's not in him
[56:19] that he walketh to direct his steps you
[56:22] see
[56:23] we were made to be reliant upon almighty
[56:26] god
[56:27] we were made to rest upon him we were
[56:30] made
[56:31] to be led by the holy spirit this is why
[56:34] david could say
[56:35] the lord is my shepherd david could say
[56:39] we are the sheep of his pasture when
[56:41] jesus comes he identifies himself
[56:44] i am the shepherd of the sheep and my
[56:47] sheep they know my voice and i know them
[56:50] by name
[56:50] and a stranger they will not follow he
[56:53] brings to you and i
[56:54] that realization it's not ashamed to be
[56:57] regarded as a sheep
[56:59] it's the most glorious privilege because
[57:01] you recognize
[57:03] i'm in need of my shepherd to guide me
[57:07] [Applause]
[57:08] hallelujah glory be to god
[57:12] you see the scripture goes on to say
[57:15] proverbs 16 9
[57:16] a man's heart deviseth his way but the
[57:19] lord
[57:20] directeth his step to devise
[57:23] is to plan god's not against you
[57:26] planning things
[57:28] god's not against plans
[57:32] the man's heart you there's plans that
[57:35] you would have
[57:36] whether it's young person middle age
[57:38] whatever
[57:39] there's plans that you have let me just
[57:41] say this if you don't have plans
[57:43] something's wrong i'm just going to be
[57:46] very direct
[57:47] don't you allow the enemy to rob you and
[57:50] put you in a corner
[57:52] amen you've got everything in the world
[57:55] to live for
[57:57] you might say brother samuel that don't
[57:59] help me a bit then let me encourage you
[58:01] it's not brother samuel saying it it's
[58:03] the holy spirit
[58:05] letting you know that there is joy to
[58:07] your life
[58:08] if you've lost your joy there's the one
[58:11] who is the joy-giver
[58:12] that's present to restore your joy
[58:17] let me tell you something joy is not in
[58:20] material things of this earth
[58:23] the real joy of the lord when you read
[58:25] in job chapter 2
[58:26] is when you've got a meat offering and a
[58:29] drink offering
[58:30] you've got a life that there is a
[58:32] fellowship with god brother
[58:34] let all hell break loose around a child
[58:37] of god
[58:37] but as long as they're in fellowship
[58:39] with god they've got a need offering
[58:42] they can offer back christ his word
[58:44] reflected in their life
[58:46] they've got a drink offering a life that
[58:49] can be poured out
[58:50] that is the greatest privilege and joy
[58:53] of the life of a child of god
[58:59] so plants can be made nothing wrong with
[59:02] plants
[59:04] but with those plans we always leave it
[59:08] if the lord wills you see because
[59:12] listen we're not under the mind of a man
[59:17] in this hour the message that come to
[59:20] you and i
[59:20] it delivered us from the reasoning of
[59:22] man
[59:24] we've been brought under the influence
[59:27] of the mighty angel
[59:29] are you with me we have been brought
[59:31] under the influence of the word
[59:34] our motives our objectives our ambitions
[59:37] have been changed
[59:40] it's him that's illuminated our lives so
[59:43] here we are
[59:44] in the presence of the living word and
[59:46] remember the word hebrews 12
[59:48] 4 4 12 says that the word is a discerner
[59:51] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[59:54] we want the living word of god
[59:56] to come and really begin to discern what
[1:00:00] are the plans that we have
[1:00:03] and god can say
[1:00:06] yes lord it don't mean listen when god
[1:00:09] says
[1:00:10] it don't mean your heart's not broken
[1:00:13] let me give you a quote brother brown
[1:00:15] says you've broken my heart
[1:00:16] many times over but i love you for it
[1:00:24] yeah i've said this many times before i
[1:00:26] i appreciate such honesty
[1:00:29] brother brown did put on an act
[1:00:33] it was right out on us before us i can
[1:00:36] relate to a man like that
[1:00:39] notice the scripture goes on proverbs 16
[1:00:42] 3 commit thy works unto the lord and thy
[1:00:46] thoughts shall be established
[1:00:49] so commit them to god
[1:00:53] that works and thy thoughts that
[1:00:56] which has been devised in the heart when
[1:00:58] you commit it
[1:00:59] into his hands then your thoughts shall
[1:01:01] be established
[1:01:02] right let's talk about how because it's
[1:01:05] not you bringing it to past
[1:01:08] it's god god his will
[1:01:11] is for your life he's the will it
[1:01:14] encompasses
[1:01:15] every part of your life
[1:01:18] you realize that god just did not place
[1:01:21] you here the number one
[1:01:22] number one reason you're here is to
[1:01:25] serve the lord
[1:01:26] is to be dramatized by the holy spirit
[1:01:29] that's the whole reason we're here
[1:01:34] that's the reason we're here is to
[1:01:35] receive his life and be a reflection of
[1:01:38] him
[1:01:38] that's why as we pass through here now
[1:01:41] the other things as far as
[1:01:43] whether it's occupation career whatever
[1:01:45] job and house and everything like that
[1:01:47] those are not just things that god takes
[1:01:49] and says let's just throw that up in the
[1:01:50] air i'm not concerned about it all
[1:01:52] that's contrary to scripture god had a
[1:01:55] place when he called him out of egypt he
[1:01:57] had a place to take him to
[1:01:59] he's the same god that says if you'll
[1:02:01] forsake father mother
[1:02:02] sister brother houses and lands he said
[1:02:05] i
[1:02:06] will provide for you houses lands
[1:02:08] sisters brothers
[1:02:09] father's mother it'll come of
[1:02:11] persecution but i won't be in debt to
[1:02:13] you
[1:02:14] i will provide for you and as a matter
[1:02:16] of fact i won't do a partial job i'll
[1:02:18] give a hundredfold
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:23] god won't be in debt to nobody
[1:02:27] when they stand on his word and stand
[1:02:30] there
[1:02:30] then god he comes on the scene to bring
[1:02:33] it to paso
[1:02:34] yes the natural things of life god's
[1:02:36] interested in that
[1:02:37] he's interested in your job he's
[1:02:39] interested where you live
[1:02:40] he's interested in all those details
[1:02:43] about our life
[1:02:44] that's not the number one priority but
[1:02:46] it still
[1:02:47] is a priority
[1:02:50] psalms 37 4 delight thyself also in the
[1:02:53] lord
[1:02:54] he shall give thee the desires of thine
[1:02:57] heart
[1:02:58] see how this is working when you delight
[1:03:00] yourself
[1:03:01] in the lord
[1:03:05] then he shall give thee the desires of
[1:03:07] thine heart
[1:03:08] it's impossible for the wrong desires
[1:03:12] and i'm not talking about sin
[1:03:14] i'm talking about desires of certain
[1:03:17] things
[1:03:17] it's impossible if we're delighting
[1:03:20] ourselves
[1:03:21] in him and him it's him
[1:03:24] that we're dwelling in then that word
[1:03:28] the word has a way of dismantling even
[1:03:31] things that you and i
[1:03:33] may be wanting to be a hunter or a
[1:03:34] trapper or certain things
[1:03:36] and we there ain't no sin in that but
[1:03:38] maybe really wanting that
[1:03:40] and here god steps down and god just
[1:03:43] brings the situation
[1:03:44] and he relieves it and you say it's
[1:03:47] yours lord
[1:03:48] amen might have been something that you
[1:03:51] know you
[1:03:52] wanted to be all your life notice commit
[1:03:55] thy way
[1:03:55] unto the lord trust also in him and he
[1:04:00] shall bring it to pass
[1:04:03] you know brother branham i've often i
[1:04:05] love this this statement that brother
[1:04:07] branham makes
[1:04:08] uh in regards to when he's getting ready
[1:04:11] to minister
[1:04:12] the seven trumpets remember he was
[1:04:14] talking about sending out announcements
[1:04:15] we're gonna
[1:04:16] you know have eight days of meetings and
[1:04:18] this is what we're going to have
[1:04:19] and he couldn't he couldn't just get
[1:04:21] settled on that
[1:04:23] and the holy spirit reveals to him when
[1:04:26] he's there on that saturday evening
[1:04:28] before he preaches
[1:04:29] recognizing your day and his message and
[1:04:31] brother graham was all tore up and
[1:04:33] his stomach and everything else but the
[1:04:35] holy spirit comes down and reveals to
[1:04:37] him
[1:04:38] those trumpets have already been
[1:04:41] supernaturally
[1:04:42] preached under that sixth seal
[1:04:45] he rests right in that and brother brown
[1:04:48] steps forward
[1:04:49] and then he preaches later on the
[1:04:52] message
[1:04:52] a feast of the trumpets and i love how
[1:04:55] brother bran
[1:04:56] how he makes this clear here he was
[1:04:58] anticipating
[1:05:00] preaching those seven trumpets but here
[1:05:03] as he's waiting on god
[1:05:04] and he says it like this he says i know
[1:05:06] this sounds very
[1:05:08] juvenile maybe to people of great
[1:05:10] learning and understanding but to the
[1:05:12] christian
[1:05:13] it's different we follow the leading of
[1:05:15] the spirit
[1:05:16] and that alone because he wouldn't let
[1:05:19] me speak on them
[1:05:21] at that time that's the ultimate as i
[1:05:24] was saying before
[1:05:26] that's ultimate this is what we're
[1:05:28] looking to to his
[1:05:29] leading his direction his guidance in
[1:05:32] our lives you find
[1:05:33] paul in through the the the new
[1:05:36] testament
[1:05:37] when paul in the journeys the missionary
[1:05:39] journeys and things
[1:05:40] you'll find how paul would even express
[1:05:43] to the different ones at ephesus and
[1:05:46] those at corinth and
[1:05:48] and those at macedonia and different
[1:05:49] places and they were desiring paul
[1:05:52] maybe to stay or they wanted paul to
[1:05:55] return
[1:05:56] and paul would write of these places and
[1:05:58] say
[1:05:59] uh you know we we we'll be passing this
[1:06:02] way
[1:06:03] and we will come and we will visit you
[1:06:05] if god
[1:06:06] permits and paul would write this if
[1:06:09] the lord wills he would always include
[1:06:12] that because
[1:06:14] knowing that above all things when this
[1:06:16] was wrote by revelation
[1:06:18] that i'm a prisoner of jesus christ that
[1:06:20] wasn't just a play on words
[1:06:23] paul meant what he said that's what it
[1:06:26] was in his life
[1:06:27] he was yoked to the word by the spirit
[1:06:29] and even when he looked
[1:06:31] when he when that woman who was
[1:06:32] following him as a fortune teller
[1:06:35] these men be the way tell us the way of
[1:06:37] god and everything else
[1:06:39] god allowed the advertisement campaign
[1:06:41] to run for a few days
[1:06:43] and finally paul remember brother ram
[1:06:45] told us in christ the mystery
[1:06:46] he said paul knew he had the authority
[1:06:50] to rebuke that spirit he said but he had
[1:06:52] to wait on god
[1:06:54] for god to give him the permission at
[1:06:56] the right time
[1:06:57] oh paul a reserved man in the hand of
[1:07:01] god the same way
[1:07:02] with is this god's will is it god's will
[1:07:05] that we go here
[1:07:06] is it god's will that we go there
[1:07:09] oh my even when you write a paul when
[1:07:11] you read in the first part of romans
[1:07:14] and you read this messenger's heart
[1:07:17] his desire was to get to rome he wanted
[1:07:20] to get there
[1:07:21] he said i want to impart some spiritual
[1:07:23] gift to you
[1:07:24] that we might share in that same mutual
[1:07:27] faith and he lets him know
[1:07:28] i've tried many times but i've been led
[1:07:31] in other directions
[1:07:32] he lets him know i'm meant to come to
[1:07:35] you many times
[1:07:36] oh my well we could really preach on
[1:07:39] that
[1:07:40] you see sometimes we can get to looking
[1:07:42] and you know brother branham i think
[1:07:44] would dramatize that
[1:07:45] with martha and mary they sent for the
[1:07:48] lord jesus
[1:07:49] he did not come right away but he came
[1:07:52] when it was the right appointed time
[1:07:56] he didn't walk according to even human
[1:07:59] emotion
[1:08:00] that was his buddy that was his friend
[1:08:02] you realize sometimes
[1:08:04] you can feel like you've got to do
[1:08:05] something for somebody out of obligation
[1:08:08] my maybe they let you stay at their
[1:08:11] house or
[1:08:12] they did this for you or they did that
[1:08:14] don't ever let me just say
[1:08:15] on the part of the giving in you don't
[1:08:18] ever want to have somebody feel that way
[1:08:20] you want it to be where it's clear hey
[1:08:22] this is just a gift you don't have an
[1:08:24] obligation to me whatsoever
[1:08:26] i'm not trying to buy your friendship
[1:08:28] this is just on my heart to do it for
[1:08:30] you
[1:08:32] and sometimes even though that's been
[1:08:34] the right way sometimes
[1:08:35] we can feel obligated my lord have mercy
[1:08:38] you remember when brother banham stood
[1:08:40] there in the message in his presence
[1:08:41] 1962 he stands in front of his church
[1:08:44] and he repents regarding the brown bear
[1:08:47] vision
[1:08:48] he tells the church in that time he said
[1:08:50] forgive me i think of the word he uses
[1:08:52] forgive me he said for being dilatory
[1:08:54] you know what dilitory means
[1:08:56] it means to be lazy or loose if there's
[1:08:58] anybody that i would not recall
[1:09:00] or ever say would be dilatory i would
[1:09:03] say brother brown is not dilatory but
[1:09:05] you see he wasn't talking about the
[1:09:07] doings out there
[1:09:08] he dealt with the dilatory part about
[1:09:10] being a little slow
[1:09:11] and to walk according to what god had
[1:09:15] showed him regarding that vision he said
[1:09:17] i i got to thinking if i go with the
[1:09:19] younger ones
[1:09:21] the older ones what are they going to
[1:09:22] say about it
[1:09:24] come on every one of us know our flesh
[1:09:27] could go in the same way
[1:09:30] hallelujah that's why those examples are
[1:09:32] included for you and i
[1:09:33] don't look at that right there listen if
[1:09:36] god told you
[1:09:37] to be there the brown bear is going to
[1:09:39] be there you're going to get that brown
[1:09:41] bear
[1:09:41] if you're in the right place at the
[1:09:43] right time don't worry what anybody else
[1:09:45] thinks that's between them and god god
[1:09:48] will take care of it
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:52] oh my my my my mind amen true
[1:09:56] so you know our plans our plans are
[1:09:59] can be very uncertain even of all the
[1:10:02] plans that we
[1:10:03] we make it can be very uncertain but
[1:10:05] there's one certain place
[1:10:08] it's the only place it's certain and
[1:10:10] that's the word of god
[1:10:13] that's the that's the word of god it's
[1:10:15] where you can rest
[1:10:16] knowing what his will is you know the
[1:10:19] bible would even write regarding
[1:10:21] this is his will that you would know how
[1:10:23] to possess your vessel unto
[1:10:24] sanctification and honor
[1:10:26] it would also right regarding his will
[1:10:28] you know you can take the promise of god
[1:10:30] right here tonight and say i know it's
[1:10:32] god's will to give me the holy ghost
[1:10:34] i know it's god's will to heal me that's
[1:10:37] his word
[1:10:38] you might say brother samuel that's not
[1:10:40] even being revealed to yet that
[1:10:42] you know it's god to heal me that's a
[1:10:44] promise in god's word
[1:10:46] that he said as many as the lord our god
[1:10:48] shall call
[1:10:49] that's a promise that you can stand on
[1:10:52] that's not you
[1:10:53] that's god and that pulsation of the
[1:10:55] holy spirit
[1:10:56] of the one who says i will makes it real
[1:10:59] to your heart and you can say
[1:11:01] the promise of the holy ghost is mine
[1:11:05] healing is mine
[1:11:08] hallelujah you're not speaking out out
[1:11:11] of the will of god
[1:11:12] you're speaking in the will of god
[1:11:16] that's why brother brown would talk
[1:11:17] about every time he goes somewhere
[1:11:20] simple counsel and direction but he
[1:11:23] would say i only try to go where he
[1:11:25] leads me
[1:11:28] he said because when i go where he leads
[1:11:30] me
[1:11:32] and opposition comes up because
[1:11:34] opposition
[1:11:35] listen being led by god and being in his
[1:11:37] will doesn't mean you're free
[1:11:40] from circumstances it doesn't mean that
[1:11:43] you're not going to be tested
[1:11:44] but the test itself only further brings
[1:11:48] to light
[1:11:49] what god has put in your heart
[1:11:53] and that's why brother bram says when i
[1:11:54] can go and i know it's the leading of
[1:11:57] the lord
[1:11:57] god is i'm feeling led to go this
[1:11:59] direction i'm pulled in this direction
[1:12:02] then he says when satan raises up i can
[1:12:04] say satan
[1:12:05] in the name of jesus christ give way i'm
[1:12:08] here
[1:12:09] in the will of almighty god
[1:12:13] what about in our homes what about in
[1:12:17] our churches
[1:12:19] we can stand that way is that right
[1:12:23] you see there's things that you know
[1:12:26] brother brown talks about
[1:12:28] remember when he went overseas he was in
[1:12:30] south africa
[1:12:31] and the great meetings that were down
[1:12:32] there remember brother branham
[1:12:35] he would share with us lessons that he
[1:12:36] himself learned
[1:12:39] he allowed he allowed his itinerary
[1:12:41] which i can understand that
[1:12:43] would allow the itinerary to be made out
[1:12:45] i know from myself
[1:12:47] and i'm sure the other brothers you know
[1:12:50] i don't know you you brothers make out
[1:12:52] the itinerary
[1:12:54] you set up as far as the meetings and
[1:12:56] where we're going and so forth and you
[1:12:57] just you have to trust the lord but
[1:12:59] i'm sure at many times of our
[1:13:02] itineraries were not
[1:13:03] even in this in this way as brother
[1:13:06] branham's we're talking
[1:13:07] weeks remember how the holy spirit
[1:13:11] told him about remaining in a certain
[1:13:14] place
[1:13:15] and brother adam this is just supposed
[1:13:18] to show you
[1:13:19] no matter what the itinerary was brother
[1:13:21] bam said we're staying right here
[1:13:24] god told us to stay right here now he
[1:13:26] had pressures from everybody else
[1:13:28] even remember when brother blacksworth
[1:13:30] came to him and brother branham looked
[1:13:31] at him and said
[1:13:32] you too brother bosworth
[1:13:36] you're right you know what brother billy
[1:13:39] paul told him said daddy you just obey
[1:13:41] the lord
[1:13:43] now you know we know we know what took
[1:13:46] place and what come out of that
[1:13:48] it was not just you know where here even
[1:13:50] with that brother branham
[1:13:52] he was under the pressure of that
[1:13:54] itinerary but brother brandon you'll
[1:13:55] hear him
[1:13:56] even after god has brought him back even
[1:13:58] you'll hear him continue to talk about
[1:14:00] it
[1:14:00] after god delivered him of that amoeba
[1:14:03] you see even because
[1:14:04] it wasn't brother branham's decision but
[1:14:07] it was those how they had set that
[1:14:08] itinerary
[1:14:09] but still within that part of it god
[1:14:12] didn't say
[1:14:13] well you know i'm just going to let you
[1:14:14] buy scot-free he had an amoeba
[1:14:17] but you know there's times and things
[1:14:18] god listen he's a faithful father
[1:14:21] are you with me he doesn't do that well
[1:14:24] i'm going to punish you
[1:14:25] no there's a part of it that times god
[1:14:28] teaches
[1:14:28] us the value and he teaches us as
[1:14:31] brother branham would say
[1:14:32] i learned my lesson he said i'm not let
[1:14:35] nobody make my itinerary out again
[1:14:40] there's things we come through you know
[1:14:42] we would love every one of us here
[1:14:44] we would love there's certain examples
[1:14:46] and things or mistakes and things
[1:14:48] man i would have loved to have passed
[1:14:49] right over is that right
[1:14:52] and even when we could look at things
[1:14:53] there's things that when i'm
[1:14:55] i'm looking here uh in the message and i
[1:14:58] sit around with you know
[1:14:59] the brothers and my buddies and
[1:15:01] different ones that i can take and i can
[1:15:03] learn
[1:15:04] other elders here in the assembly
[1:15:06] different ones i
[1:15:07] listen my heart is always open for god
[1:15:09] to be able to speak and to learn
[1:15:11] and to take direction from that but i
[1:15:14] look at this here
[1:15:15] you know it always comes to a place that
[1:15:17] no matter what we're going to do
[1:15:20] let's always be open to his leading
[1:15:23] in other words we want to have a comma
[1:15:27] not a period whatever the event
[1:15:30] in our life we want to have a comma
[1:15:34] not a period because a period is where
[1:15:37] it ends that's it there's no more
[1:15:40] but a comma says we believe all this
[1:15:43] and all that god has done and all that
[1:15:45] he'll continue
[1:15:46] to reveal we want our lives to be guided
[1:15:51] by a comma that we're open it's not lord
[1:15:53] this is how it's got to be
[1:15:54] you're going to come this way it's got
[1:15:56] to be like this if you don't show up
[1:15:58] here
[1:15:58] in 35 minutes i'm out of here lord if
[1:16:00] the sound surface doesn't go like this
[1:16:02] if the service doesn't go like this then
[1:16:04] lord i'm out of here
[1:16:06] because god doesn't come according to
[1:16:08] our thoughts concerning things
[1:16:10] we want to have a comma not a period
[1:16:15] because to have a period is to boast as
[1:16:18] though
[1:16:18] we've got it all definitive
[1:16:22] is that right you see this is why
[1:16:25] brother brown could say says i don't
[1:16:26] know what tomorrow is
[1:16:29] i don't know what it holds but i know
[1:16:31] who's holding it
[1:16:32] that's where my faith is built
[1:16:36] not on tomorrow but in him who holds it
[1:16:41] and this is why you know that faith just
[1:16:44] being
[1:16:44] built and just resting in him this is
[1:16:46] why we
[1:16:47] desire we should desire that our life
[1:16:50] would be
[1:16:50] so inclined with the word of god so
[1:16:53] given
[1:16:54] to the word of almighty god because it's
[1:16:56] that one solid place
[1:16:58] the only solid place there is is in him
[1:17:02] the rest is sinking sands
[1:17:05] it's shaking there's only one place it's
[1:17:08] to be
[1:17:09] in him this is why
[1:17:12] that even solomon would write in the
[1:17:14] book of proverbs and i'm just going to
[1:17:16] just going to skip into a verse here but
[1:17:19] he would speak
[1:17:20] of how that a life should value the word
[1:17:23] he's speaking to the young man
[1:17:25] to the young person that their lives
[1:17:27] would so value
[1:17:29] the word of god too let it be upon the
[1:17:32] neck
[1:17:32] to be yoked with it to be led by it to
[1:17:35] be directed by
[1:17:37] and let it be in your heart let your let
[1:17:39] your heart be
[1:17:40] yielded to him and then the promise is
[1:17:44] not only will you have favor with god
[1:17:47] but you'll also have favor with man
[1:17:51] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[1:17:57] and lean not unto thine own
[1:17:59] understanding
[1:18:00] you see it's to be fully in him
[1:18:04] this is why we're not leaning upon what
[1:18:07] a man has said
[1:18:10] we're leaning on thus saith the lord
[1:18:14] when god as he sent this message god
[1:18:17] never gave us
[1:18:18] the thoughts of a man this is god's
[1:18:21] thoughts
[1:18:22] the spirit of truth has sought it out it
[1:18:25] didn't take us out of the bible
[1:18:28] if any experience is is designated to be
[1:18:32] an experience that won't line up with
[1:18:34] the word
[1:18:34] it's not the true experience of the
[1:18:37] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:39] and you're leaning on your own
[1:18:41] understanding
[1:18:42] that shaky ground this is why trust
[1:18:46] not in your own understanding but but
[1:18:48] that you would lean
[1:18:50] not in thine own understanding but trust
[1:18:52] in the lord with all thy heart
[1:18:54] that all of your life is resting in him
[1:18:57] and your understanding is i know him
[1:19:01] in the power of his resurrection i know
[1:19:03] him
[1:19:07] i don't know how but i know he changed
[1:19:09] me
[1:19:11] i know he came in and he did a work in
[1:19:14] my life
[1:19:15] it so it's a little work that it loves
[1:19:18] him
[1:19:19] it's a work that cries out amen to the
[1:19:22] word
[1:19:23] it's a life that lines with that word
[1:19:25] it's a reality that
[1:19:26] changed me it's something that is
[1:19:29] indescribable but yet i know
[1:19:31] that it's there
[1:19:34] in all thy ways look at this admonition
[1:19:36] in all thy ways
[1:19:37] acknowledge him and he shall
[1:19:40] direct thy path
[1:19:45] to acknowledge him
[1:19:48] is not just to say lord i just kind of
[1:19:51] want to get your thoughts on this lord
[1:19:54] i'm acknowledging you i want to get your
[1:19:56] thoughts
[1:19:57] lord what do you think as though that
[1:20:03] we have some better thought
[1:20:09] pardon me for being very clear but even
[1:20:11] as a per even as someone comes down
[1:20:13] listen i'm a man that's true but god
[1:20:16] promised he'd be a mighty counselor
[1:20:19] god promised that he would use the gift
[1:20:21] of a pastor
[1:20:23] when you've got questions when you've
[1:20:24] got things and i can tell you this
[1:20:26] if you approach it if you approach it in
[1:20:28] the way of let's see what brother samuel
[1:20:30] says
[1:20:32] you end up doing your own thing i'm just
[1:20:34] preaching it straight
[1:20:36] you'll go your own way some you know
[1:20:39] some won't even come
[1:20:40] that's fine i don't i don't pressure
[1:20:42] anybody to come but i'm just trying to
[1:20:43] tell you
[1:20:44] that we are not to approach god in that
[1:20:46] way to approach him in that way
[1:20:47] is boastful as though that we know
[1:20:51] a better way just remember
[1:20:55] you didn't get yourself out of sin
[1:20:58] i don't care how much you tried you
[1:21:00] could never
[1:21:01] get the filth and the dirt and the spot
[1:21:04] you could never change your nature it
[1:21:07] took an
[1:21:07] almighty god coming down to bring a
[1:21:10] transformation in your life
[1:21:12] he's the same god that said i'll give
[1:21:14] you pastors
[1:21:15] i give you evangelists i give you
[1:21:18] teachers i
[1:21:19] give you prophets i give the apostles
[1:21:21] he's the same god
[1:21:23] because it's his ministry it's his
[1:21:26] care for his people
[1:21:33] you know me well enough those of you
[1:21:34] whether you're streaming or not
[1:21:36] if i don't if there's something at that
[1:21:38] time it hasn't come to me
[1:21:40] i'll tell you you know what let's just
[1:21:41] pray about it
[1:21:43] listen you actually say that listen i
[1:21:45] learned a long time ago maybe this is
[1:21:47] just honest confession is good for the
[1:21:49] soul
[1:21:51] i said this in one of the places that
[1:21:53] one where the young couples were we're
[1:21:55] together you all remember
[1:21:57] i made a statement i said you know what
[1:21:59] i used to think
[1:22:00] man you starting this pastor i've got to
[1:22:02] have the answers
[1:22:04] i used to think man when i became a
[1:22:06] husband i got to have the answers
[1:22:08] when i'm a dad i gotta have the answers
[1:22:10] i said you know what i put undue
[1:22:12] pressure on myself
[1:22:13] it wasn't god it wasn't one of the
[1:22:15] people it's me
[1:22:17] but do one thing you realize i don't
[1:22:19] have to have all the answers
[1:22:21] i just have to look to him who is the
[1:22:22] answer
[1:22:25] that's why in situations and things that
[1:22:27] they when they arise
[1:22:29] now when i look at that and say god i'm
[1:22:31] just trusting you
[1:22:32] whether it comes at a moment's notice or
[1:22:34] it's something that's planned
[1:22:35] it's laid out say god i'm looking to you
[1:22:38] you guide and direct me
[1:22:39] you said take no thought what you're
[1:22:41] saying this time
[1:22:43] oh my sometimes you're just sitting
[1:22:46] there and i'm waiting waiting and all of
[1:22:47] a sudden then he comes
[1:22:48] oh my when when he comes that's it right
[1:22:51] there
[1:22:52] i mean you just feel like everything
[1:22:54] right there at that point in time that's
[1:22:55] what the anointing is it's supreme
[1:22:57] control
[1:22:58] it's just everything right there at the
[1:23:00] time the devil couldn't move nowhere
[1:23:03] god is good in me that was free
[1:23:07] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[1:23:10] shall direct that path so
[1:23:11] we just don't want to we're not wanting
[1:23:13] to know what what's your opinion on this
[1:23:18] god but here's what we'll do if we
[1:23:20] acknowledge him he'll direct our paths
[1:23:23] think about jehoshaphat ahab said hey
[1:23:26] buddy
[1:23:27] hey come on let's let's you and me
[1:23:30] let's go down here to and you know and
[1:23:32] fight the syrians
[1:23:34] you know i mean unless you and me get an
[1:23:37] apartment together
[1:23:40] come on somebody come on let's let's
[1:23:42] look at this right here
[1:23:44] and jehoshaphat said well my sure you
[1:23:46] know
[1:23:47] my you know we're brothers my horses are
[1:23:49] your horses and everything
[1:23:50] jehoshaphat went down there without
[1:23:54] consulting
[1:23:55] the lord first but he had enough god
[1:23:59] about him
[1:24:01] he was down there in that situation and
[1:24:03] all of a sudden joshua
[1:24:04] so fast something started ringing on the
[1:24:06] inside of me he said wait a minute here
[1:24:10] wait a minute you see charity is
[1:24:13] catching boast
[1:24:16] charity is catching the boast
[1:24:19] and he said hey let's consult the lord
[1:24:22] on this
[1:24:23] they have said sure i'll get my pets out
[1:24:25] of here we'll let them we'll let them
[1:24:26] out and let them come out
[1:24:29] but after it was all said and done that
[1:24:31] still didn't stabilize
[1:24:33] jehoshaphat because you only know why
[1:24:36] that wasn't of god
[1:24:42] but here came one micah
[1:24:46] he spoke the thoughts of god
[1:24:50] it behooves us before just committing to
[1:24:53] something
[1:24:53] see what's the mind of the lord in this
[1:24:58] look hey no no doubt a lot of thoughts
[1:25:01] could have went through his mind hey
[1:25:03] god told joshua when the tribes were
[1:25:06] going to stay on the one side of jordan
[1:25:07] don't you you go fight with your
[1:25:09] brethren when the land is conquered then
[1:25:10] you can go back over
[1:25:12] but you see we have to know what word to
[1:25:15] apply
[1:25:16] in that situation that's what brother
[1:25:18] brahm said he said somebody can say
[1:25:19] pick up a scripture judas hung himself
[1:25:21] no you go do the same
[1:25:24] but you got to know the word that's for
[1:25:25] the season that's for the hour
[1:25:28] god supplies the word that is meant to
[1:25:31] address that need
[1:25:33] what do i do rest in him god will bring
[1:25:36] it to life
[1:25:38] is that right you see we don't have no
[1:25:40] guarantee
[1:25:41] i think we're we're we're settled on
[1:25:44] that you have no guarantee
[1:25:45] of tomorrow we have to prepare
[1:25:49] today for tomorrow
[1:25:55] when god in the beginning when you look
[1:25:58] at this
[1:25:59] the steps the very those parts within
[1:26:02] creation
[1:26:03] what god did one day prepared for the
[1:26:08] next day
[1:26:10] everything was a preparation building up
[1:26:15] there's been a preparation that's been
[1:26:17] building up
[1:26:19] you see god don't he won't accept any
[1:26:22] excuse
[1:26:23] on that day there'll be no excuse
[1:26:27] accepted
[1:26:28] well lord you know this or you know that
[1:26:32] there'll be no excuses but there's no
[1:26:35] guarantee of tomorrow
[1:26:37] but we're living in a time we're living
[1:26:40] in a place
[1:26:42] where you would think people would
[1:26:45] already be in a place to realize
[1:26:47] hey there's no guarantee of tomorrow
[1:26:52] we're living a year right now it's
[1:26:55] closing in on a year
[1:26:56] from where you know where we just had
[1:26:59] stepped away and we streamed for two
[1:27:01] weeks
[1:27:01] because this virus came in
[1:27:05] i mean that's how long that's how much
[1:27:07] time has passed by
[1:27:10] right what things that people would say
[1:27:13] was a guarantee
[1:27:14] you realize there's no guarantee
[1:27:19] is that right yeah so we don't know
[1:27:21] there's no guarantee
[1:27:22] for tomorrow um let's say this in both
[1:27:25] ways
[1:27:26] this not only applies in the spiritual
[1:27:28] but i also want to bring it
[1:27:30] even into the natural you make
[1:27:31] preparation even right now
[1:27:34] for even the future oh brother simon
[1:27:38] now see here's it i've just got to
[1:27:41] preach
[1:27:42] sometimes you know i've been in youth
[1:27:43] meetings sometimes young people know how
[1:27:45] to use the word
[1:27:46] in order to get their convenience
[1:27:50] but that ain't just young people i have
[1:27:51] seen all ages do those things
[1:27:54] well you know the coming of the lord is
[1:27:55] upon us that is not a license to rush
[1:27:57] into marriage preach brother samuel
[1:28:01] i might be an old man there's a lot
[1:28:03] worse things than being an old maid or
[1:28:05] an old bachelor
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:08] easier for you to say no no no you
[1:28:10] shouldn't say that i've been on the
[1:28:12] other end counseling
[1:28:15] i've been on the other end where the
[1:28:16] peace is trying to be picked up
[1:28:19] are you with me but you see sometimes
[1:28:22] they
[1:28:22] want to just use these things and and
[1:28:24] moving out like that but the prophet
[1:28:26] told us
[1:28:26] how we ought to conduct our lives we do
[1:28:29] not plan
[1:28:30] on as though that well you know that the
[1:28:32] coming of the lord
[1:28:33] is distant we live as though he can come
[1:28:37] at any moment
[1:28:40] but we plant and plan as if it's a
[1:28:43] hundred years from now
[1:28:45] that's why brother branham when he
[1:28:46] preaches that house meeting called
[1:28:49] thy house he takes the believers
[1:28:52] a small group there in tifton georgia
[1:28:55] and he tells the
[1:28:56] parents he says let's make arrangements
[1:29:00] that this message will continue it's
[1:29:03] that
[1:29:03] which our children have something to
[1:29:06] walk in
[1:29:08] that was the responsibility let me just
[1:29:10] say tonight
[1:29:11] i thank god i hope those my daddy and
[1:29:14] the rest of them on the other
[1:29:16] on the other portals on the other side
[1:29:18] brother branham's listening and the rest
[1:29:19] of them
[1:29:20] thank you for going thank you for making
[1:29:23] arrangements for this moment
[1:29:29] they made arrangements for this moment
[1:29:32] we don't know how long we have here
[1:29:36] but we're proud to make arrangements
[1:29:39] david laid up not that he would build
[1:29:42] the temple
[1:29:43] but that it the reserves would be there
[1:29:45] for solomon
[1:29:46] to build it
[1:29:49] see this is where we close
[1:29:53] that same bank of scripture in james 4
[1:29:55] that we read
[1:29:56] same same bank of scripture the very
[1:29:59] last scripture
[1:30:00] says in regards to that whole thought
[1:30:04] therefore to him
[1:30:07] that knoweth to do good and doeth it not
[1:30:11] to him it is sin
[1:30:15] so over and over brother bran would
[1:30:18] reiterate this
[1:30:20] don't put off tomorrow but you can do
[1:30:23] today
[1:30:25] because you may not have tomorrow
[1:30:29] you say oh i've heard that said before
[1:30:32] i've heard that said i've i've
[1:30:35] received that scare attack it's not a
[1:30:37] scare tactic but if there's not a fear
[1:30:39] of god if you're not standing where you
[1:30:41] are
[1:30:42] to be standing if there's not a fear of
[1:30:44] god that doesn't rattle your soul
[1:30:46] you're in bad shape
[1:30:51] because we are at the end
[1:30:57] many different things that i've been
[1:30:58] studying on the side and
[1:31:00] different things just looking at with
[1:31:01] events taking place
[1:31:03] things that where we're getting ready
[1:31:04] heading into you realize the prophet he
[1:31:06] identifies that
[1:31:08] that sixth vision and kamala hara stood
[1:31:11] there
[1:31:11] in that same dress
[1:31:14] and the way that he described it in
[1:31:17] daniel 6
[1:31:18] 70 weeks that's the way i wouldn't look
[1:31:20] it up the designer of the dress
[1:31:23] describes it with those exact same words
[1:31:28] you know we're at we're in that sixth
[1:31:30] vision
[1:31:32] the prophet identifies in the message
[1:31:34] shalom he said
[1:31:35] five visions have been fulfilled that's
[1:31:38] the sixth vision
[1:31:40] and before the seventh comes to pass
[1:31:43] where america
[1:31:44] is laid in craters and ashes the bride
[1:31:46] is gone
[1:31:49] how close are we
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:55] and then we have how many times you
[1:31:57] heard this down through the ages well
[1:31:58] i'm just waiting on california
[1:32:00] you'll be left behind
[1:32:03] well i'm waiting on this well if i'm
[1:32:06] predestinated
[1:32:07] i can't miss it that is a false spirit
[1:32:10] teaching trying to handle the word in a
[1:32:13] wrong way
[1:32:14] if you're predestinated you live like it
[1:32:17] you
[1:32:17] enter in you get with the program you
[1:32:20] line up with god's word
[1:32:22] you're not waiting for those things if
[1:32:25] you have to wait for those things it's
[1:32:26] because
[1:32:27] you don't love him and god ain't taking
[1:32:30] nobody with him
[1:32:31] that don't love him i know that's hard
[1:32:34] but it's a truth
[1:32:38] don't put off the bible says behold now
[1:32:41] is the day of salvation
[1:32:44] hallelujah in the book of ecclesiastes
[1:32:46] remember now
[1:32:47] thy creator in the days of thy youth
[1:32:50] it's a now
[1:32:51] thing now not tomorrow now
[1:32:56] you take the one young lady sat in the
[1:32:58] service i just heard the prophet say it
[1:33:00] the other day
[1:33:01] on marriage a lamb she said in that
[1:33:03] service and the and the word was going
[1:33:05] forth she was a preacher's daughter
[1:33:07] and she told brother random she said
[1:33:10] hold the nerve you've got to come preach
[1:33:11] in my daddy's pulpit
[1:33:13] like that he said i wasn't hired to come
[1:33:15] here i came here by an invitation
[1:33:18] but she turned down her last time
[1:33:21] and eventually brother brown made her on
[1:33:23] the street it didn't matter her daddy
[1:33:25] was the pastor
[1:33:26] it didn't matter what connection she had
[1:33:28] god was dealing with her heart
[1:33:30] because her daddy couldn't change her
[1:33:32] god's the only one who could change her
[1:33:34] and god was convicting her heart he was
[1:33:37] dealing with her
[1:33:38] life the way she was dressing and living
[1:33:41] and acting
[1:33:42] and that night she turned it down for
[1:33:44] the last time
[1:33:46] to even be able to walk up to the
[1:33:48] prophet of god in later years and offer
[1:33:50] him a drink of whiskey
[1:33:53] she said that was my last time preacher
[1:33:56] she said i could see my mama's soul
[1:33:58] frying hell like a pancake and it won't
[1:33:59] bother me
[1:34:02] why she put off
[1:34:07] put off to tomorrow but the bible says
[1:34:10] we're to take care of things today the
[1:34:13] bible says
[1:34:14] agree with an adversary while it is day
[1:34:18] let not the sun go down on thy wrath
[1:34:21] if you got a quarrel forgive me
[1:34:24] are you with me forgive don't put
[1:34:27] off don't boast that well i have an
[1:34:29] opportunity i have this don't boast
[1:34:32] love bounteth not charity
[1:34:35] is bound to the word it honors the word
[1:34:39] in readiness to live in a state
[1:34:42] of readiness so why a question
[1:34:46] at times i'm closing lord why wait
[1:34:50] why wait why that lives wait
[1:34:53] at times you know the longer a person
[1:34:56] i'm preaching on this whether
[1:34:58] is going to archives and everything else
[1:34:59] you know longer a person waits the
[1:35:01] harder it becomes
[1:35:06] it's a truth the rich young ruler
[1:35:10] this man he not only trusted in his
[1:35:12] riches but he trusted
[1:35:14] in his youth he trusted in his youth and
[1:35:18] he got it made he had everything going
[1:35:21] for him
[1:35:22] and he even told his soul
[1:35:26] soul take thy rest
[1:35:30] everything's good bigger barns are built
[1:35:34] it's good you never ever want to get
[1:35:38] away
[1:35:39] from the spirit of god and being
[1:35:42] sensitive to him
[1:35:45] even if he listened to me it should be
[1:35:48] god keep me
[1:35:49] tender keep me soft
[1:35:53] keep me humble and if you haven't
[1:35:56] surrendered your life all the way
[1:35:58] why not what are you waiting on
[1:36:02] what are you holding back on don't put
[1:36:04] off tomorrow
[1:36:05] what you can do today well i'll wait to
[1:36:08] this or i wait to that meeting or i'll
[1:36:10] wait
[1:36:10] don't boast against tomorrow amen
[1:36:13] well i'll wait you see how easy it
[1:36:15] becomes and then eventually it just
[1:36:17] becomes a church life
[1:36:19] comes just to church you're showing up
[1:36:21] to church and well i go to this church
[1:36:23] and i go to this church
[1:36:24] and that's all that's happening it's
[1:36:26] just going to a church
[1:36:29] but they're not in christ around the
[1:36:32] message where the promises
[1:36:34] of the living god have been confirmed
[1:36:36] have been made alive
[1:36:38] where all the blessings were the liberty
[1:36:40] rest
[1:36:41] but instead what's that i'll get it next
[1:36:44] service
[1:36:46] i'll wait till the next service listen
[1:36:49] friends there's not one of us that has
[1:36:50] the promise
[1:36:52] of tomorrow as i said moments ago look
[1:36:55] how quickly
[1:36:56] look how quickly the world changed
[1:37:00] when this virus come in that ought to be
[1:37:02] a wake-up call
[1:37:04] that'll be a wake-up call how quickly
[1:37:07] things have changed where there's
[1:37:09] brothers and sisters right now
[1:37:10] different ones they still can't meet we
[1:37:13] can meet thank god
[1:37:15] but there's some different countries and
[1:37:16] places they're not allowed to meet
[1:37:18] still you see this is where
[1:37:23] we want to make use of every opportunity
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:26] as the lord jesus said and this is what
[1:37:29] our prayer should be
[1:37:30] in to thy hands i commit my spirit
[1:37:34] to the spirit of this age it looks and
[1:37:37] it goes on and says there
[1:37:38] the bible said to be scoffers mockers
[1:37:41] would rise
[1:37:42] and you know what they'd say there's the
[1:37:43] promise of his coming
[1:37:45] things continue on it's over this time
[1:37:48] that's in the world out there let me
[1:37:50] bring it down in here
[1:37:53] where you can hear oh oh yeah i've heard
[1:37:55] this preach and i know this and i know
[1:37:57] what's coming next and
[1:37:58] i can tell what's coming next and i can
[1:38:00] hear this and i know what's going to be
[1:38:01] sent here and i know it's going to be
[1:38:03] coming next and i can
[1:38:04] that's what he's talking about when it
[1:38:07] becomes
[1:38:08] all things continue on and missing noah
[1:38:11] preached the same
[1:38:13] message over and over
[1:38:16] there were scoffers that sat there and
[1:38:19] said i know what he's going to preach
[1:38:20] today
[1:38:21] what rain
[1:38:25] but there were those who hated his call
[1:38:29] it wasn't the world but his family
[1:38:32] listen to me
[1:38:33] it's more than just a natural family
[1:38:36] we're talking about the family
[1:38:38] of almighty god the word has a meaning
[1:38:42] to us
[1:38:42] you sense the the move the move of the
[1:38:45] holy spirit
[1:38:46] friends there's been transitions that
[1:38:48] has taken place
[1:38:50] even in this past year and not just this
[1:38:52] past year alone
[1:38:53] i've noticed transitions
[1:38:59] some of you may not you don't get out
[1:39:01] very much but i've never seen so much
[1:39:03] i'm talking about in youth meetings
[1:39:04] so much demonic manifestation where
[1:39:08] devils were they are that overtaken with
[1:39:10] spirit
[1:39:11] i've never seen so much of that in my
[1:39:13] life and working with young people
[1:39:15] those who are bound for hours and
[1:39:18] dealing with that dealing with that life
[1:39:20] to get them free that they let that
[1:39:22] spirit would take its hands off and
[1:39:24] release their life you know what that is
[1:39:26] that's a sign of where we're at
[1:39:31] that's why as a young person don't you
[1:39:34] put off today
[1:39:35] but for today what you think you can do
[1:39:37] tomorrow
[1:39:39] legion only had one beer it eventually
[1:39:41] led to two beers
[1:39:42] to four beers to six beers don't you
[1:39:45] look at that stuff on the internet
[1:39:47] it'll keep on going from one site to
[1:39:49] another site
[1:39:50] to hour after hour after hour don't put
[1:39:53] off
[1:39:54] deliverance for tomorrow when he's here
[1:39:57] right now
[1:40:02] boasts not against the lord
[1:40:06] but stand upon his word and you make
[1:40:09] that declaration
[1:40:10] i'm not going to be a church member
[1:40:14] i'm not just going to be somebody who's
[1:40:16] acquainted or
[1:40:17] around the message i'm not going to make
[1:40:19] excuses for things in my life i'm not
[1:40:22] going to make them say well i'm i'm
[1:40:23] making it a little bit
[1:40:25] but to look and say god you're the god
[1:40:27] of today
[1:40:28] you're the god of the now and whatever
[1:40:31] it is i
[1:40:32] give my life to you withholding nothing
[1:40:36] nothing nothing lord
[1:40:40] you complete me
[1:40:44] when that happens then he who has the
[1:40:48] future
[1:40:50] your life then is in his hands
[1:40:55] so then your future becomes clear
[1:41:00] you don't know maybe every little
[1:41:02] junction
[1:41:04] but it don't bother you he's leaving
[1:41:12] told the young people years ago
[1:41:17] he said like this i said you know
[1:41:20] there's things in your life that you
[1:41:21] plan on
[1:41:24] and you should there's natural
[1:41:25] attributes that's in your life
[1:41:29] whether it be a husband be a wife
[1:41:35] but god did not leave it to you that
[1:41:38] you'd have to search
[1:41:39] that out
[1:41:42] apart from his word
[1:41:46] but if you bury yourself in him
[1:41:50] and you look to him he is el shaddai
[1:41:53] he's the all-sufficient one he's the god
[1:41:56] who spoke in jeremiah 29 it says
[1:41:58] i know the thoughts i think concerning
[1:42:00] you to bring you to an expected inn
[1:42:03] because after all whoever god has for
[1:42:05] you and you for them
[1:42:06] you want to ensure it's in christ
[1:42:10] you can't miss god's will
[1:42:14] when you're yielded to his word
[1:42:19] amen the way of man is not in man to
[1:42:22] lead his son
[1:42:23] but there's a god who's here tonight
[1:42:26] that can change that life maybe you're
[1:42:28] on the internet maybe those that would
[1:42:30] archive this there's a god who's present
[1:42:33] that that god can speak to your heart
[1:42:35] and say
[1:42:37] now is the time
[1:42:40] speak to your heart and you can say lord
[1:42:43] i receive my healing now
[1:42:48] i receive my deliverance now
[1:42:52] lord i receive the holy spirit not just
[1:42:55] something you're just saying but
[1:42:57] you're you're being moved by the spirit
[1:42:59] of god it's a pulsation
[1:43:02] that's moving in your heart it's moving
[1:43:04] in your life
[1:43:06] listen how do i know i'll be able to do
[1:43:08] it you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:43:10] the god that you put your life in his
[1:43:13] hands
[1:43:14] it's no longer your life it's him
[1:43:18] all he's asking is is turn your life
[1:43:21] over
[1:43:22] let me i know what your future is let me
[1:43:26] come let me walk walk with me
[1:43:29] let me walk with you in your future
[1:43:34] because we don't know what the future
[1:43:35] holds can you stand with me
[1:43:38] we don't know what the future holds we
[1:43:39] don't know what the next moment holds
[1:43:41] friends listen
[1:43:42] we don't know there's so many things
[1:43:46] it's different things that even that
[1:43:47] have just been just studying as i said
[1:43:49] just just studying out on the side
[1:43:51] there's so many things
[1:43:54] that are to happen after we're gone
[1:44:01] after we're gone some things i was just
[1:44:04] studying here the other day and
[1:44:06] i thought about it ahead i had a
[1:44:08] question come to me sometime before
[1:44:10] brother graham is so clear all the way
[1:44:12] through
[1:44:13] daniel 70 weeks all through the first
[1:44:17] seal
[1:44:18] he'll move her into the fifth seal with
[1:44:19] it that covenant
[1:44:22] between rome and the jews we're not even
[1:44:25] here to see it
[1:44:27] the church is done caught away
[1:44:32] i don't have sometimes some of those
[1:44:35] things just kind of spill over but it's
[1:44:36] it's to point to the time we're at it's
[1:44:39] a time that
[1:44:40] the spirit of god could speak to the
[1:44:42] prophet
[1:44:44] and he would liken it to us standing in
[1:44:46] a train station
[1:44:48] seeing the events taking place all
[1:44:51] around us
[1:44:52] and he said then in 1963 he said it's
[1:44:56] time to throw the bag of peanuts down
[1:45:00] i don't know different ones many of you
[1:45:03] have traveled
[1:45:04] airports maybe not trains
[1:45:07] but there's been times when i've been in
[1:45:09] an airport you know i love my coffee
[1:45:13] you don't care about the food as long as
[1:45:14] i can get coffee not on an airplane
[1:45:16] either

[1:45:20] my
[1:45:22] see the flight gets in this time this
[1:45:25] flight leaves over here
[1:45:26] at three man i've got a two-hour window

[1:45:36] the coffee shop the place that i like
[1:45:40] oh it's in terminal f could i make it
[1:45:42] from terminal 8
[1:45:43] to terminal see i'm trying to see
[1:45:47] how much time do i have do i have enough
[1:45:50] time to make it there
[1:45:52] and get back here for departure of my
[1:45:54] next flight
[1:45:57] maybe you know i'm a little hungry and i
[1:45:59] say oh
[1:46:00] they got a chick-fil-a here oh i wonder
[1:46:02] if i can go there oh it's down that way
[1:46:04] look at the time but you know there's
[1:46:07] been times
[1:46:09] where the plane itself
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:13] supposed to get in at 12 and i wasn't
[1:46:14] supposed to board the next one until two
[1:46:16] or three
[1:46:17] something happened
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:21] and the plane got there a little bit
[1:46:24] later
[1:46:26] then everything all the plans change
[1:46:30] then you've had times where on the plane
[1:46:34] supposed to be two o'clock that's when
[1:46:36] it is
[1:46:37] but it just so happened that plane was
[1:46:39] there a little bit early
[1:46:42] and they boarded
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] now some of you know that you've had
[1:46:47] this happen if you haven't it can happen
[1:46:49] my mom had it happen to her i had it
[1:46:51] happen to myself going to mexico the one
[1:46:52] time
[1:46:54] we were there ahead of time
[1:46:58] but they closed the door
[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:03] it was so close it was just like 10
[1:47:04] minutes we were there
[1:47:08] what am i saying
[1:47:12] we're living in a time when we don't
[1:47:14] have two hours
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:17] we don't have time to make plans that
[1:47:20] put
[1:47:21] our lives first in god second
[1:47:26] i'm not saying brother sam you mean i'm
[1:47:28] not to plan on natural things in my life
[1:47:30] that's not what i said
[1:47:33] but don't become wrapped up with the
[1:47:34] peanuts
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:39] it's a time to make sure
[1:47:42] it's a time to be sure i don't say that
[1:47:45] to scare you but
[1:47:46] it's a time to check up it's a time
[1:47:51] because the rapture it's upon us
[1:47:56] events the way things have been taken
[1:47:58] place
[1:47:59] nobody as far as some of the details let
[1:48:02] me just tell you something
[1:48:08] i've already seen two different videos
[1:48:10] of men who are pentecostal preachers
[1:48:13] one in the states and one in africa and
[1:48:15] they played
[1:48:16] these parts about brother branham and
[1:48:18] what was taking place there
[1:48:20] with kamala harris and that deep royal
[1:48:22] purple dress
[1:48:24] that's just two of them they're looking
[1:48:26] at that and saying it was a prophet of
[1:48:28] god
[1:48:29] but listen friends to you and i
[1:48:32] we recognize it's not just a prophet of
[1:48:35] god
[1:48:35] declaring this shall come to pass but a
[1:48:38] prophet
[1:48:39] is whom the word of the lord comes to
[1:48:42] when
[1:48:42] israel got out of line they still have
[1:48:44] the law still have the prophets
[1:48:46] still have the psalms they could say
[1:48:48] we've got our bible but they didn't have
[1:48:50] the word of the lord
[1:48:52] their lives were not matching the word
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:57] so in order for them to come back into
[1:48:59] their inheritance
[1:49:00] god would send a prophet
[1:49:04] one who was in contact who could look
[1:49:06] over and see
[1:49:08] this is where you're to be this is what
[1:49:10] god has ordained you to be
[1:49:12] he's able to look into that realm and be
[1:49:15] able to speak down here and say
[1:49:17] this is where you belong
[1:49:20] it's an inspiration a breath of god to
[1:49:23] catch us into that place
[1:49:25] into position this is the this is the
[1:49:29] blessing
[1:49:30] as a young person
