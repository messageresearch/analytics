[38:26] security in your kingdom by the Holy
[38:28] Ghost father me you bless the service
[38:31] bless the word may all that send dumby
[38:33] to your glory and may you receive praise
[38:35] and honor we ask it in the mighty name
[38:37] of Jesus Christ amen and amen god bless
[38:41] you it's good to be with you again this
[38:43] this morning and going into this
[38:45] afternoon
[38:46] I just want to before I take my text
[38:50] this morning if you want to start
[38:51] turning you can it's gonna be Genesis
[38:52] the 13th chapter but as you're turning
[38:55] there I just want to thank each one I
[38:56] know different ones they're familiar
[38:58] that I just got back from India here a
[39:00] little over a week ago and different
[39:01] ones praying for me and things you just
[39:03] want to extend our thanks for that the
[39:06] Prophet said that when you're praying
[39:08] for someone like that that you get the
[39:11] same reward amen is that right he was
[39:14] getting ready go to Palestine and he was
[39:16] talking about this he said those that
[39:17] pray for the meetings it says you it's
[39:19] accounted to you as well amen and he
[39:21] always uses the store I love the story
[39:22] the little the woman she she was a wast
[39:26] when when she saved her money up she
[39:27] paid up it was a baby Simpson to come
[39:30] preach their town she hand out tracts
[39:32] and one little boy showed up to the
[39:34] meeting amen and and you know for most
[39:37] people that have looked at that and said
[39:39] that wasn't a very good turnout or very
[39:42] the turn of events but that one little
[39:44] boy got saving the meeting was Dwight
[39:45] Moody and from that man millions of
[39:48] souls were saved and brother Graham said
[39:49] who gets the credit for that that woman
[39:51] does so your prayers are not in vain I
[39:55] appreciate it I appreciate the different
[39:57] ones that pray for my wife and family
[40:00] God just really blessed us with the
[40:03] different meetings we had I think over
[40:05] 60 people come flora get baptized and
[40:07] different ones receive the Holy Ghost a
[40:09] lot of different healings and some
[40:11] miracles I don't have time to tell Maus
[40:13] but since you're standing although I'll
[40:15] be doing that for a while anyway
[40:16] but I just I I think one that would
[40:20] suffice is a noteworthy one you know the
[40:23] Bible talks about the gate before a
[40:24] notable miracle cell I thought this was
[40:26] noteworthy and what was it was actually
[40:29] two years ago when I went and I say this
[40:31] because sometimes you don't know what
[40:33] the Lord's doing even right now you're
[40:35] praying for things and you don't always
[40:36] know what the Lord's doing and you might
[40:39] not even find out in this life but I
[40:40] believe we'll find out by and by but I
[40:42] think this is a good example with the
[40:43] language barrier and stuff there is a
[40:45] brother and he was in the church and
[40:47] he'd been in an accident and of course
[40:50] if you've ever been overseas you know
[40:51] how they drive anyway but they were in
[40:53] an accident there and his esophagus was
[40:55] completely crushed and they had him in
[40:58] the emergency room and they'd given one
[41:01] maybe two hours to live at the most
[41:03] because if his esophagus was crushed and
[41:05] so the morning service before we even
[41:07] had the song service they come to me and
[41:10] said well we won't you lead the
[41:11] congregation of prayer so as a
[41:13] congregation we prayed for that young
[41:15] man
[41:15] I didn't know what happened I I've
[41:17] completely forgot about it be real
[41:18] honest with you not that I didn't care
[41:20] whatever but you know just you after a
[41:22] while you didn't hear nothing and I got
[41:23] back this year and brother mother pretty
[41:25] said I need to tell you something and
[41:26] he's got my number so I don't know I
[41:28] waited two years but he said I need to
[41:30] let you know something he said when we
[41:31] had prayer that morning for that man and
[41:33] his esophagus was crushed it said the
[41:35] Lord healed him right there that very
[41:37] moment and he walked out of the hospital
[41:39] and so of course I was pretty excited
[41:42] some praise the Lord
[41:44] yeah praise the Lord I was happy I
[41:46] believe God is the same today men and so
[41:49] like I said people praying we don't
[41:52] always know even a man we don't always
[41:54] know but we know these faithful and if
[41:57] we remember that we retain that I
[41:59] believe that God will bless us amen and
[42:01] so I just wanted to share that with you
[42:02] and many other things the Lord did but
[42:05] he's a longtime God and he's the same
[42:08] and I believe he's not just the same in
[42:10] India I believe it's the same right here
[42:11] today
[42:12] whatever your need is just as the
[42:14] thirteenth chapter and I just want to
[42:17] read I'm gonna read most of the chapter
[42:18] here we read the first 15 verses and now
[42:21] Thursday when I was here on the screen
[42:23] there I was checking out the different
[42:24] things in the counters this that then
[42:26] there's a picture come up brother Samuel
[42:28] browning he had his text behind him I
[42:30] believe was the same chapter so I hope
[42:32] he didn't preach the same thing I did or
[42:34] at least not in recent history the date
[42:36] said 1996 I thought well that can't be
[42:38] right but I so anyhow praise the Lord I
[42:41] believe it'd be a blessing to you though
[42:42] Genesis the 13th chapter and we just
[42:45] asked the Lord would have preeminence
[42:47] this morning as we read the word it says
[42:48] this and Abram went up out of Egypt he
[42:51] and his wife and all that he had a lot
[42:54] with him into the south and a place of
[42:57] the altar which he had made there at the
[42:59] first and I'll come back to this later
[43:01] but he come back to this first altars in
[43:03] there Abram called on the name of the
[43:06] Lord and watch what happens next and a
[43:09] lot also which went with Abram had
[43:12] flocks and herds and tents and the land
[43:15] was not able to bear them so that they
[43:16] might dwell together for their substance
[43:18] was great so that they could not dwell
[43:21] together and there was a strife between
[43:23] the herdsmen of Abrams cattle and the
[43:26] Hermit of Lots cattle and the Canaanite
[43:28] and the perizzite dwell dwell then in
[43:31] the land
[43:31] Abraham Abram said unto lot let there be
[43:34] no strife I pray thee between me and
[43:37] thee and between my herd men and I
[43:39] Hermon for we be brethren is not the
[43:42] whole land before thee separate thyself
[43:44] I pray thee from me if that will take
[43:47] the left hand then I will go to the
[43:49] right or without apart to the right hand
[43:51] then I will go to the left I'm brother
[43:53] Branham makes the point this is a this
[43:55] is a good Christian spirit he preferred
[43:56] his brother
[43:57] first amen and says a lot lifted up his
[44:01] eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan
[44:03] that what it was well watered everywhere
[44:05] before the Lord destroyed Sodom Gomorrah
[44:08] even as the garden of the Lord like the
[44:11] land of Egypt as thou comest into zou
[44:13] are then lot chose him all the plain of
[44:16] Jordan and lot journeyed East and they
[44:19] separated themselves the one from the
[44:21] other Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan
[44:24] and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain
[44:27] and pitched his tent towards Sodom but
[44:30] the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners
[44:32] before the Lord exceedingly verse 14 and
[44:36] the Lord said unto Abram and the
[44:38] scripture makes a point of this after
[44:40] that lot was separated from him lift up
[44:44] now thine eyes and look from the place
[44:46] where thou art northward and southward
[44:50] and eastward and westward for all the
[44:53] land which thou seest to thee will I
[44:55] give it and to thy seed forever may the
[44:59] Lord bless the reading of his word you
[45:01] may be seated this morning amen Thursday
[45:05] I was talking about this idea and I've
[45:07] taken several thoughts on this idea of
[45:09] inspiration and Thursday I was talking
[45:12] about the inclination it's not a common
[45:15] word we used by the inclination the
[45:16] inspiration where the RAM stirs we
[45:18] should always have a burden for one
[45:19] another he says if we see indifference
[45:21] coming in says it's another spirit amen
[45:23] so we always want to have the right kind
[45:25] of we have the right kind of a burden
[45:27] that's when God could inspire us amen
[45:29] God actually inspires the burden and if
[45:31] we allow him to do with us that way he
[45:33] he adds to it amen
[45:35] so we're taking the thought of
[45:36] inspiration this morning I want to take
[45:38] a thought separation brings inspiration
[45:40] amen and so we look at this idea of
[45:43] inspiration and I I always choose to
[45:45] quote the Prophet at the beginning of
[45:47] this thought I want to remind you once
[45:48] again the brother Branham said that that
[45:50] inspired believers taking the inspired
[45:53] word those two together brings the
[45:55] results amen
[45:56] I don't have the quote for me but
[45:58] brother Brent talks about in the church
[45:59] age book he talks about what worship was
[46:01] like he moves in the Ephesian Church age
[46:03] in the church age book he talks about
[46:04] the manner of worship and how the
[46:06] were moved and they worshiped by the
[46:08] holy ghost and he says it's a far cry
[46:10] from what we see today where we just
[46:12] have a few inspired preachers preaching
[46:14] some of the word and the people aren't
[46:16] getting inspiration amen and so I just
[46:18] want to remind you the Word of God and
[46:20] this message even is inspired I believe
[46:22] that you can press play and hear tape
[46:24] and that tapes inspired today man I
[46:27] don't want to just press play but I want
[46:28] to be inspired as a preacher amen and I
[46:31] don't want you to be as far as a
[46:32] preacher I want the people to be
[46:34] inspired amen
[46:35] it's it's no good for me as a minister
[46:37] or a pastor to get up and have an
[46:39] inspiration and a vision for what he
[46:42] thinks that God wants to do in their
[46:43] life or in their church and he's poured
[46:45] his heart out and the people just have
[46:47] no care or they're indifferent toward it
[46:49] amen and I know you know this and I
[46:50] don't believe that's what I'm talking to
[46:52] that type of people this morning you
[46:54] wouldn't be here amen hopefully you
[46:55] didn't come here just because you wanted
[46:57] to be seen and heard of men but you come
[46:59] here because you're inspired to be here
[47:01] amen
[47:02] and so we understand that without a
[47:04] vision the people perish is that right
[47:06] so we want to be inspired by the same
[47:08] inspiration now and then we got to be
[47:11] careful about this because lots of
[47:12] people get the same inspiration and it's
[47:13] the wrong inspiration
[47:14] amen I want I want to remind you in
[47:17] Genesis chapter 11 then Ron got inspired
[47:19] and the people got inspired with them
[47:21] and I think it's marvelous at the unity
[47:24] of the people under a wrong inspiration
[47:28] was so great that God come down and
[47:31] looked at it and said I'm gonna go down
[47:32] and confound their language because
[47:34] nothing will be withheld from them
[47:36] listen if I could get everywhere on the
[47:38] same page under the same inspiration
[47:41] what could the people accomplish today
[47:44] then they could do that under Nimrod to
[47:47] build a tower trying to measure only
[47:49] they haven't so much that God loves
[47:51] attention and he confound the people's
[47:54] language how much more to that if we can
[47:57] get inspired by the Word of God the word
[47:59] of this hour listen I'm not trying to
[48:01] convince you to build a mark for me this
[48:02] morning so we can get about you animals
[48:04] on board a man I'm not trying to build a
[48:06] temple we're gonna build a replica art
[48:07] nothing like that
[48:09] we have the word for the day it's the
[48:11] it's a light amen because when the word
[48:13] is vindicated it's a lie Amen we don't
[48:17] have to live under a glare we don't have
[48:19] to have our own idea but if we can get
[48:21] that inspired by the Word of God how
[48:24] much greater is it then what Nimrod
[48:26] there what would Caesar than what Hitler
[48:29] was able to accomplish hey man so we
[48:32] want to have that kind of inspiration
[48:33] our life we would have fall into it we
[48:36] want to be led by an amen amen
[48:39] I believe that's what makes the
[48:40] difference between a person and a life
[48:42] it just drifts along an ordinary life
[48:44] with no real direction we just live from
[48:46] job to job or from trial to trial from
[48:48] paycheck to paycheck but when you get an
[48:50] inspiration in your life that's the
[48:52] thing that begins to carry you through
[48:54] disappointments to discourage was there
[48:56] trials there's something that carries
[48:58] you amen
[48:59] I look at men in the natural men have
[49:02] brother Brent talks about Walt Disney of
[49:04] all people hey man and I got inspired by
[49:06] a little moss that may have been
[49:08] rejected his comic after comic him he's
[49:10] looking at me like Edison and a man that
[49:13] he went through one after another
[49:15] material trying to find the film it
[49:16] there inspiration there was something in
[49:19] them when they found 10 times 20 times
[49:22] 30 times a hundred times yet they knew
[49:25] there was something about them in their
[49:26] life that's just in the natural if God
[49:30] could do that with the man in the
[49:31] natural with a sinner how much more
[49:33] that's believers see us I wrote this
[49:37] down I was praying about this one I was
[49:39] just in the Miller and I wrote this down
[49:40] in my book I take note Smith but I put
[49:42] this down I said that all men follow
[49:44] something and then followers follow a
[49:47] leader and leaders follow their vision
[49:49] or their ambition and then everybody's
[49:52] following something even the maintenance
[49:53] a leader he's following his ambition or
[49:55] his vision
[49:56] and how much greater if a man can catch
[49:59] a glimpse of the living Jesus Christ and
[50:02] then we're not being left by a desire
[50:05] that's going to to build a bigger Church
[50:07] or to have a greater kind of a CEO or a
[50:10] better job we're being led by the
[50:12] captain of the hearts of the army of the
[50:14] Lord hey man yo has come to do things
[50:18] that are mixed in to lead us
[50:20] I don't ladies desire to lead us into
[50:22] just a mini oh girl I say man I'm not
[50:25] talking on a bunch of Hollywood amen a
[50:27] Christian life to humble life a man she
[50:29] is so humble the people missed it is
[50:31] that Alright
[50:32] [Applause]
[50:34] it's unimportant it doesn't take away
[50:52] from the changed we're believing for the
[51:20] change in my body that it's not far
[51:24] [Applause]
[51:30] even while I'm preaching amen you said
[51:34] that sounds like a fanaticism listen we
[51:36] don't watch them pray amen we should be
[51:39] expecting it that should be the
[51:40] inspiration that gets us out of bed in
[51:42] the morning Bui Lera has done an Irish
[51:44] bit inspiration we're living in the hour
[51:46] of the rapture no one has been revealed
[51:57] [Applause]
[52:00] and we believe according to Scripture
[52:02] revelation 22 at the time of the opening
[52:05] of this word the time is it but at the
[52:13] opening of this word we're not to seal
[52:17] back up we're not to hide it it's been
[52:19] open hallelujah I hope something burns
[52:25] in your heart every day for a greater
[52:28] walk with God listen up but I tell you
[52:32] what different people they're inspired
[52:33] by different things
[52:34] amen different people they're looking
[52:37] for different things some people are
[52:38] looking for a bigger than sir greater
[52:40] that of this time I'm inspired by the
[52:42] idea that this world pest house is going
[52:45] to be quick
[52:48] I'll tell you what if you're getting
[52:50] older at all you should be inspired as
[52:52] well all the back pain and all the gray
[52:54] hairs and all the wrinkles and all the
[52:56] disappointments all the friends that are
[52:58] walked away
[52:59] all the things you had to deal with all
[53:01] the things that tried to drag you down
[53:02] one bin you're gonna put off this
[53:04] mortality that means more to me than a
[53:12] paycheck
[53:13] that means more to be popular to know
[53:19] that I'm gonna receive a crumb of the
[53:20] last jewels in saying this women it
[53:34] really shows you the unbelief in some
[53:35] people even ministries
[53:48] [Music]
[53:55] [Music]
[53:58] [Applause]
[54:04] [Music]
[54:09] obtain the excellency of Christ see the
[54:15] reward it's greater than the suffering I
[54:18] know don't seem like it some days the
[54:21] rewards greater than the discouragement
[54:23] listen if anybody complaint was Paul
[54:25] here's a man that was beaten he was
[54:28] shipwrecked he was called every kind of
[54:30] name in the book he wasn't hurries
[54:32] offerings fastings in prisons and
[54:35] to--let's and then he said our light
[54:37] affliction here he would say you are
[54:59] your listen I'm happy to go but I'm not
[55:06] satisfied to go by myself and then I
[55:08] want to go everyone I want our young our
[55:11] old I believe I got a family listen
[55:16] brother bear appreciate it man I'm Way
[55:18] off here have your attacks
[55:20] [Applause]
[55:21] listen brother Brown preaches a token
[55:23] message for a reason there's got to be a
[55:26] family out there somewhere well that
[55:29] whole family and that praise the Lord
[55:33] there's gotta be families somewhere that
[55:35] will fulfill that well one they take one
[55:38] we left I understand that a member from
[55:40] my house there's got to be somebody to
[55:52] fulfill that because God has never left
[55:54] himself without a witness but you some
[56:00] hot bad news out there yeah I live under
[56:04] a rock
[56:05] listen I come out of the world I come
[56:08] out of sin I know a little bit about it
[56:11] but let me say this I'm not impressed by
[56:27] the
[56:31] [Applause]
[56:39] [Music]
[56:46] the greater the enemy seems the greater
[56:49] the manifestation of God's power he says
[56:56] you know I'm gonna have a bride in the
[56:59] midst of Satan's Eden she's gonna serve
[57:05] me she's not gonna make guys with the
[57:08] separation so yeah I got home home
[57:10] somehow there's a separation there's
[57:14] something different about you than the
[57:16] rest of the Chaldeans there's something
[57:19] different about using the rest of the
[57:21] people in her and then we look at this
[57:24] man Abram he looked like everybody else
[57:27] hey man this is a man he's 7 years old
[57:29] and God calls him me God calls this man
[57:33] to come out of her child ear and go to
[57:35] Canaan a man and I just want to dwell on
[57:37] this for a sec because sometimes we read
[57:38] this thing like a newspaper and when I
[57:40] read this while back and the Lord was
[57:42] dealing with me I just thought so fast
[57:43] and he because the Bible doesn't tell us
[57:45] that God ever spoke to Abram before that
[57:48] maybe he did maybe he didn't I don't
[57:49] know huh hey man but never tell us that
[57:51] he spoke to him before that he doesn't
[57:53] even tell us how was it a dream was it a
[57:55] vision did he send an angel I don't know
[57:57] but something happened with Abram this
[57:59] man he was 70 years old don't ever think
[58:01] you're too old to serve God
[58:02] this man 70 years old God speaks to him
[58:06] in such a way I don't know what it lies
[58:08] about however God spoke to him it was in
[58:10] such a way that he left his home God
[58:14] speaks him one time I want you get up
[58:16] and guard this land and going to a land
[58:19] I prepared for you listen he didn't have
[58:21] a job recruiter waiting for him at the
[58:22] other end he didn't have some sort of a
[58:24] a GPS or Googler to get him there
[58:27] but a man that maybe never even heard
[58:29] from God before heard the voice of God
[58:31] and he was so convinced it was God not
[58:34] just an imagination not just some Idol
[58:36] or something else he was so convinced it
[58:39] was God it was such a conviction his
[58:41] heart he left everything
[58:44] listen this wasn't a young man striking
[58:46] out trying to find a future this is the
[58:48] man whose life it looked like was over
[58:51] seven years I can't do much more for my
[58:54] times about God was just now get ready I
[58:59] [Applause]
[59:01] think about how powerful this is God
[59:04] speaks to him
[59:05] and he's probably got home he's got land
[59:06] whatever he's gotten you know amen
[59:08] it may be a land or a job whatever it is
[59:11] and he leaves all these things because
[59:14] of the voice of God and yet didn't fully
[59:18] obey God then for some reason it was
[59:23] easy I say easy relatively speaking it
[59:27] was easier for him to leave his land and
[59:30] his heritage and everything you never
[59:31] know and I really need grown up wrong he
[59:33] could leave that but he couldn't leave
[59:34] his daddy he couldn't leave his nephew
[59:37] this is anymore come with you no it
[59:40] wasn't a bad idea no God is wanting to
[59:49] deal with Abram and he only called Abram
[59:53] a man and so as great as it was and as
[59:57] profound as it was that he left
[1:00:00] everything as far as his lands in his
[1:00:02] homes everything else he left all those
[1:00:04] things yet he didn't leave lot behind
[1:00:07] he didn't leave Haran behind is that
[1:00:09] right and I want you to understand that
[1:00:11] we all have different lot in life no pun
[1:00:14] intended a man we all have different
[1:00:16] Lots in life is that right now once you
[1:00:18] notice that God was calling Abram to a
[1:00:21] full separation not just a partial
[1:00:24] separation and for whatever reason
[1:00:26] that's what he that's what he presented
[1:00:27] to God amen the reason I got inspired by
[1:00:30] this actions I had a brother and he come
[1:00:32] up to me he I think he texted me after
[1:00:34] church one time or something and he and
[1:00:36] he asked me a question I think it's
[1:00:38] remarkable because many times people do
[1:00:41] this he said you know brother I've been
[1:00:42] in church for years and I've heard lots
[1:00:44] of preaching and I was here this idea we
[1:00:46] need to die to this we need to die to
[1:00:48] ourselves he says I hear that so much
[1:00:49] brother he says what does that really
[1:00:51] mean to you I thought well that's your
[1:00:53] question you know
[1:00:54] time this becomes a buzzword as we would
[1:00:56] say oh you got to die to something a man
[1:00:58] and so he's like what does that mean to
[1:01:00] you brother I begin to share with him
[1:01:01] what does the scripture say in the Bible
[1:01:03] tells us in Matthew 16 verse 24 says
[1:01:06] then jesus said unto his disciples If
[1:01:09] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:01:13] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:01:16] me for whosoever will save his life
[1:01:20] shall lose it and whoever will lose his
[1:01:23] life for my sake I want to throw that in
[1:01:26] there for my sake shall find it for what
[1:01:29] is a man profited it's one of the
[1:01:32] sayings all right what is a man profited
[1:01:34] if he gains the whole world loses his
[1:01:38] own soul or what shall a man give in
[1:01:42] exchange for her soul well can you offer
[1:01:44] an exchange for a soul it's worth ten
[1:01:46] thousand worlds does anybody have that
[1:01:47] kind of money in the bank anybody have
[1:01:49] that kind of righteousness daughter what
[1:01:51] you couldn't give anything they
[1:01:53] exchanged for it so if you have an
[1:01:55] opportunity to redeem it by the grace of
[1:01:57] God it's worth more than the riches of
[1:01:59] the world it's worth more than Fame
[1:02:01] which would fade away this was more than
[1:02:03] well that perishes it's worth everything
[1:02:06] because everything is worth nothing
[1:02:09] without it Luke chapter 14 verse 27
[1:02:13] whose summer doth not bear his cross and
[1:02:16] come after me cannot be my disciple now
[1:02:19] you can go to church you can listen to
[1:02:21] tapes you can quote a prophet you can be
[1:02:23] best friends with whoever but if you
[1:02:25] can't bear your cross you can't be his
[1:02:28] disciple right now and he uses the
[1:02:31] knowledge it's a familiar analogy and I
[1:02:32] will read it here it says for which of
[1:02:35] you intending to build a tower sitteth
[1:02:38] not down first counteth the cost whether
[1:02:43] he have sufficient to finish it lest
[1:02:45] haply after he has laid the foundation
[1:02:48] and is not able to finish it watch this
[1:02:51] all that behold it begin to mock him
[1:02:54] saying this man began to build was not
[1:02:58] able to finish it now notice what they
[1:02:59] do they mock it they bring her approach
[1:03:01] on the world
[1:03:02] how many ministers how many men how many
[1:03:03] women they heard this message I heard
[1:03:06] this gospel and they start out you know
[1:03:08] they didn't have any rude they sprung up
[1:03:09] fast and they they they walked a man the
[1:03:13] word it burned in their hearts and that
[1:03:15] they had maybe God really even did
[1:03:18] something in their life but yet because
[1:03:19] there was no root because they were
[1:03:21] never really sold out because they never
[1:03:24] really counted the cost one day they
[1:03:26] come to a cost they're not willing to
[1:03:28] pay see when you when you account for
[1:03:31] this cost you don't just account for the
[1:03:33] cost that you have now but yeah you know
[1:03:36] how I try to teach my children this up
[1:03:38] you know if you're gonna do something it
[1:03:41] costs $20 to do it and you're gonna
[1:03:43] build something you don't you have to
[1:03:45] have more than $20 amen because
[1:03:46] something might come up or you might
[1:03:48] have to change something amen you know
[1:03:51] it's like a builder that's why you was
[1:03:52] cut a board long cuz it's easier to cut
[1:03:54] a board short you can't can't get a
[1:03:55] board stretch it's just for background I
[1:03:58] don't know about you but any time I do I
[1:04:01] do when these projects at home and I
[1:04:03] tell you what if I made one of these
[1:04:04] videos on YouTube you'll be in watch it
[1:04:06] cuz it take up six hours change the
[1:04:08] light bulb
[1:04:09] no I'm serious maybe you can identify
[1:04:12] I'm the guy that goes to the hardware
[1:04:14] store gets everything he needs now I've
[1:04:16] kind of the cost and then I go home
[1:04:18] realize I forgot this thing so I go back
[1:04:20] again now it's six o'clock and even I
[1:04:22] forgot something else I'll just finish
[1:04:23] up tomorrow six months later I get done
[1:04:25] see there's all these costs that you
[1:04:28] don't think about sometimes some of
[1:04:31] these guys they start doing the tower
[1:04:33] wrong I got enough credit for it on that
[1:04:35] plastic you might not be it you might
[1:04:37] hit your limit not be done and when you
[1:04:40] count the costs you have to consider not
[1:04:43] just the force evil but even the things
[1:04:45] you don't perceive I'm coming to
[1:04:47] something here in a minute a man but I
[1:04:48] want you to notice it and this is where
[1:04:50] I was telling this brother I said with
[1:04:52] this is something that everybody has to
[1:04:54] do amen he says we have to take up our
[1:04:55] cross so there's nobody that's can say
[1:04:58] well I already done that because it's
[1:05:00] everyday I mean this listen this is
[1:05:02] something you're going to do every day
[1:05:04] if your lives and we live another 10
[1:05:06] years or
[1:05:07] hundred years every day you've got to
[1:05:09] get up and take their crops a man so
[1:05:11] there's nobody here that to say well
[1:05:13] that sermon is not for me it's for all
[1:05:14] of us we all have to do it every day
[1:05:16] that was the cost we considered when we
[1:05:19] first took it up hey man I suppose where
[1:05:23] you got to take inventory every day in
[1:05:25] your life hey man we have to ask
[1:05:27] ourselves am I willing to sacrifice
[1:05:30] everything for this kingdom am I willing
[1:05:33] to lay everything aside my own ambitions
[1:05:36] my own idea whatever would be a job a
[1:05:39] family I'm not talking necessarily
[1:05:41] destroying there to get rid of it I've
[1:05:42] come that a second but are we wanting to
[1:05:44] give God first always or amen or do we
[1:05:49] get like saw work once he got blessed he
[1:05:51] forgot the Lord amen
[1:05:54] praise the Lord brother Graham says this
[1:05:57] is the power of transformation
[1:05:58] it's 1965 is it sometimes you have to
[1:06:01] separate from everything that's dear on
[1:06:03] earth to you to take your position that
[1:06:06] God has called you to is I'm sure you
[1:06:09] carry between the lines I'm saying see
[1:06:11] sometimes the very dearest person on
[1:06:14] earth you have to shake hands with them
[1:06:16] and take your position in Christ to
[1:06:18] where God has called you see but what is
[1:06:21] God doing transforming you from what you
[1:06:24] are maybe a daughter some whatever it is
[1:06:26] from a lovely family sometimes he places
[1:06:29] you somewhere because it's his way of
[1:06:31] doing it see by the renewing of mind to
[1:06:34] obey the Word of God
[1:06:37] regardless of what the price is now and
[1:06:41] this is what I was just saying a moment
[1:06:42] ago you can separate from something that
[1:06:44] doesn't mean you have to destroy it
[1:06:45] necessarily amen I see this all the time
[1:06:48] well well I hate saying this way but
[1:06:51] even with message believers a man well
[1:06:52] this person goes to this church and then
[1:06:54] some message cherished is that so
[1:06:55] they're all just this and that we're not
[1:06:56] against the people we're gets the spirit
[1:06:59] of the organization amen then sometimes
[1:07:02] people they want to cut people off
[1:07:03] because they don't believe the same way
[1:07:04] or think the same way listen you can
[1:07:07] separate from unbelief without having to
[1:07:09] cut people off Amen I'm not out to
[1:07:11] destroy those people actually want to
[1:07:12] see them sing
[1:07:14] Boxey went to see God deal with him you
[1:07:16] really managed example with a lot
[1:07:18] he says law he says it's kind of rude
[1:07:19] saying mrs. Abraham's a silver dollar
[1:07:21] and lost just a penny and listen if
[1:07:24] allot sister penny says that's your
[1:07:26] nominal brother is that right just
[1:07:28] because he separates from lot doesn't
[1:07:29] mean he puts them to the sword
[1:07:31] he'd up trying to strum he actually
[1:07:32] saved a lot he actually stands in the
[1:07:36] gap for a lot even though he's just a
[1:07:38] penny he stands no gap for him a mint
[1:07:41] that's something you can do for him but
[1:07:44] listen Abraham he was it was more of a
[1:07:46] help and a blessing to lot once it
[1:07:48] separated listen you don't help get
[1:07:51] people saved by acting like the world
[1:07:52] hey man wait we don't want drink with
[1:07:55] him and I'll care on that limbs and
[1:07:57] they'll get saved a man man I went to
[1:07:58] one of these churches I had a family
[1:08:00] member they invited me to this church so
[1:08:02] I went one time and the pastor he
[1:08:04] preaches this two times I went there he
[1:08:06] preached the same sermon it's all about
[1:08:07] drinking a beer with your friends and
[1:08:09] tailgate party talking about Jesus I
[1:08:11] said what kind of nonsense it doesn't
[1:08:13] have anything else to preach cuz I heard
[1:08:14] this very the same thing so that society
[1:08:16] would just mingle with them that's what
[1:08:18] the Catholic Church did hey man now
[1:08:21] listen I'm not against law I'm not now
[1:08:23] to destroy law amen
[1:08:25] listen it all that lot could do is
[1:08:27] believe that Jesus Christ died for sins
[1:08:29] I say praise God I don't want to
[1:08:31] discourage him if that's what lot can do
[1:08:33] listen it's better than the barroom
[1:08:36] that's better than being out there in
[1:08:38] the world and all kinds of Filth
[1:08:40] they said back off he can't believe they
[1:08:42] let him believe that I think God I would
[1:08:44] encourage him but listen I was called a
[1:08:46] traitor separate from the lies he wants
[1:09:01] to but you calling
[1:09:04] as for me I've got a grade of college
[1:09:06] I've been called to total separation
[1:09:09] from unbelief I mean that's what Haven
[1:09:12] was called dude he had a greater calling
[1:09:14] in his life than lot amen
[1:09:16] praise the Lord like I said that man is
[1:09:18] still better off let's not get
[1:09:20] frustrated with them listen they do a
[1:09:22] lot of good things you know the
[1:09:23] hospitals in school
[1:09:24] that's all good that's fine that's good
[1:09:26] stuff buts like brother Brad said that's
[1:09:28] not what we were called to do that's not
[1:09:29] the main thing those things are all
[1:09:31] right but they leave out the gospel and
[1:09:34] that's what were called to a man I'm
[1:09:37] called to preach the word the way it was
[1:09:39] given by the original inspiration you're
[1:09:41] called to believe the same word were
[1:09:43] called to believe it that way a man just
[1:09:45] like Abram was Amen praise the Lord so
[1:09:48] we don't get frustrated with them but
[1:09:49] what we want to do is be like Abram what
[1:09:51] is our separation because if you really
[1:09:54] want to help that person if you really
[1:09:56] want to be a blessing you've got to find
[1:09:57] your position first
[1:09:59] hey man praise the Lord
[1:10:03] now listen many of us would come from
[1:10:06] different kinds of walks amen and many
[1:10:09] of us have separated from different
[1:10:11] kinds of things in our life
[1:10:12] maybe addiction maybe lost or whatever
[1:10:15] drinking whatever we come from different
[1:10:17] lives I come out of different things and
[1:10:19] we're like Abram we we heard a call and
[1:10:22] it called out we separate ourselves but
[1:10:24] this is where I'm coming to this morning
[1:10:26] many of us have left these things we
[1:10:28] believe the message we're like Abram we
[1:10:30] left that country we separated ourselves
[1:10:31] but yet there's things that we carry
[1:10:34] with us and this is why I'm coming to
[1:10:36] you this morning about inspiration it's
[1:10:38] the things that we leave off or the
[1:10:41] things that we carry with us that hinder
[1:10:43] us from hearing from God amen it's
[1:10:46] something great big things that we
[1:10:48] already did or didn't do it's the little
[1:10:50] things we carried with us this one talks
[1:10:52] separation brings inspiration why would
[1:10:54] I hear from God listen Abram went many
[1:10:56] years without hearing from God and maybe
[1:10:59] he even questioned well I've gotten the
[1:11:01] promise and I'm here I've done what I
[1:11:03] was supposed to whatever if not God was
[1:11:06] waiting for a total separation see it's
[1:11:09] one thing to be separated it's another
[1:11:11] thing to be sold out
[1:11:13] hey man hell I'm gonna bring it down now
[1:11:16] it's one thing to be said listen they
[1:11:21] separate themselves from certain things
[1:11:23] they have a separated kind of a
[1:11:25] lifestyle but they're not sold out to
[1:11:27] this gospel man we can quit our smoking
[1:11:30] we can quit our drinkin we can dress the
[1:11:32] right way will you come to church but I
[1:11:34] would really sold out it's one thing to
[1:11:37] be a separated person that's nothing to
[1:11:39] be sold out to be a prisoner to Jesus
[1:11:42] Christ were you forcing it every night
[1:11:44] you've given up every design of your own
[1:11:47] and you're just a prisoner to his word
[1:11:49] and as well many of us many Christians
[1:11:53] many message believers lack gave them
[1:11:56] all they left the Baptist Church all
[1:11:58] they started girl in the house oh they
[1:11:59] stopped smoking but where they sold out
[1:12:02] act well praise the Lord
[1:12:06] well I was taught that sir my family was
[1:12:09] this way this is how we are well this is
[1:12:11] the kind of job I have my job requires
[1:12:13] in it we hold onto little things
[1:12:16] hey man sometimes it's uh maybe it's a
[1:12:19] cousin maybe it's a fit maybe it's your
[1:12:21] family amen
[1:12:22] pray slow well listen I want my family
[1:12:24] the same I understand but you don't save
[1:12:26] them amen by mingling with the world you
[1:12:29] saved them by example you've got to
[1:12:32] create this and that living brother baby
[1:12:33] talks about she was praying for her
[1:12:35] husband comes home with them drunks
[1:12:36] listen her getting mad at them and
[1:12:38] trying to ask them that didn't do
[1:12:40] anything but because she had a sold-out
[1:12:43] life that was the power of her to redeem
[1:12:47] her husband that's the power you to
[1:12:49] redeem is there something different
[1:12:50] about you you've got a higher calling
[1:12:53] amen praise the Lord
[1:12:57] where the RAM says this and expectation
[1:13:01] 1961 just remember until Abraham fully
[1:13:04] obeyed God the blessing never come until
[1:13:07] he fully obeyed God he took his daddy
[1:13:11] along he caused trouble and then a lot
[1:13:13] finally caused trouble and a herd man
[1:13:15] and then a Suzie got separated he says
[1:13:18] he fully obeyed and when he comes
[1:13:21] follow buddies then God brought the
[1:13:24] blessing amen
[1:13:27] it's full of beatings it's looking for
[1:13:29] listen it's like I said many Christians
[1:13:30] struggle with fobian listen I've had
[1:13:34] people coming I'm not being critical but
[1:13:35] I've had people come to me maybe you can
[1:13:38] relate to this and they come to you and
[1:13:39] their deal with a certain situation
[1:13:41] there's certain things going on in their
[1:13:42] life and they say well I just don't know
[1:13:44] about his brother or what do you think
[1:13:46] and I say well it doesn't matter what I
[1:13:48] think it's what the word says and you
[1:13:50] Tom
[1:13:51] well the Bible says that's well the
[1:13:53] Prophet said this like well I don't know
[1:13:56] I'm just going off to pray about it I'm
[1:13:58] like so you didn't like my answer they
[1:14:04] were satisfied with the answer
[1:14:06] I'm thinking what's there to pray about
[1:14:07] I'd be like a man saying well you know I
[1:14:09] work a job and I just you know just the
[1:14:11] world embezzle money from my employer
[1:14:13] I'm not sure you should have pray about
[1:14:15] that it's kind of there already
[1:14:18] God kind of doesn't give me the answer
[1:14:21] wants me to go get another wife from
[1:14:23] this that why I know what the answer is
[1:14:25] it's in the word hey man you got one we
[1:14:29] don't need to do I don't know if you've
[1:14:30] got any platelets here but I'm calling
[1:14:31] you out now and then listen the word for
[1:14:34] you Provident over the answer
[1:14:36] listen we won't drop into something
[1:14:39] mysterious and serious like I tell
[1:14:41] people all the time it shows you the
[1:14:43] modern age we live in people they're
[1:14:44] always waiting for a phone call from God
[1:14:45] what what's got to call me up I wish God
[1:14:47] would speak to me I went for inspiration
[1:14:49] will God speak to me they're waiting on
[1:14:51] the phone call from God
[1:14:52] hey didn't send a letter in the mail how
[1:15:02] do you know he then told me he'd never
[1:15:05] wrote it down for 2,000 years ago for
[1:15:07] you what are you looking for an answer
[1:15:09] for
[1:15:12] these little things are little opinions

[1:15:51] my sheep know my voice they're gonna
[1:15:55] hurt it somewhere before the listener
[1:15:59] I'm not trying to whatever ah the
[1:16:01] reverse is true to get these people O
[1:16:03] God spoke to me I'm supposed to do such
[1:16:04] a thing
[1:16:05] well God never speaks unions how am i
[1:16:07] speaking it out Oh cuz you're gonna get
[1:16:08] a bigger bed count oh it's gonna give me
[1:16:10] the ministry all can give me big bad
[1:16:14] well hallelujah anyhow all right we
[1:16:20] don't we don't want to have a
[1:16:21] consecrated life but we went on the
[1:16:23] blessing it's a man but the RAM says
[1:16:27] this is always a connection with the
[1:16:29] spoken word of God God's promised for
[1:16:31] the day when it comes it's so unusual to
[1:16:35] the people can hardly grasp it we're so
[1:16:37] so deforms and ideas of our own ah why
[1:16:41] quit smoke and I quit drinking this what
[1:16:43] about your own ideas what about your
[1:16:46] family's idea of things or your church's
[1:16:49] idea or so-and-so your favorite preacher
[1:16:52] well my favorite preacher preaches it
[1:16:53] this way well praise God I'm all for the
[1:16:55] freedom of speech but this is preaching
[1:16:57] I want to see if he's preaching what the
[1:16:59] word says listen if I didn't tell you
[1:17:01] something conquer the Prophet I don't
[1:17:03] want you to believe me I know that
[1:17:05] sounds weird but it's a church thing man
[1:17:06] I want you to believe the Word of God
[1:17:08] that's my goal my goal not creator hey
[1:17:12] my words but to hang on every word of
[1:17:15] God and if I can get inspired by the sea
[1:17:17] where I believe you hear the same God
[1:17:18] amen my desire is not to present my own
[1:17:22] idea as if it were the gospel truth and
[1:17:26] yet so many times that's what we do to
[1:17:30] ourselves I was just born this way well
[1:17:33] I just raised this way what's that have
[1:17:35] to do with anything we're so so darf to
[1:17:41] forms and ideas of our own it's hard for
[1:17:46] us to grasp what is the truth see we get
[1:17:51] attached to things don't we we get
[1:17:54] attached to things listen Abram I
[1:17:56] understand he was attached to his
[1:17:58] father's and his wife was it says the
[1:18:00] same father amen they were attached to
[1:18:02] him they were attached a lot and I
[1:18:05] understand that in the natural but yeah
[1:18:07] that was the thing that was hindering
[1:18:10] them from hearing from God see he
[1:18:13] counted the cost of leaving the promises
[1:18:15] well I'm gonna have to give a house
[1:18:16] offered you a plan that's how I'm gonna
[1:18:18] find them what about this part that's
[1:18:20] the part you didn't want to factor into
[1:18:22] the cost amen
[1:18:23] praise the Lord I think about this when
[1:18:31] God calls Abraham one day he'd begin to
[1:18:34] speak to him because notice he speaks to
[1:18:35] him afterwards is that right what's he
[1:18:37] do he goes back and he finds the altar
[1:18:39] where he left God and after he does that
[1:18:41] God causes something to happen and he
[1:18:43] speaks to him and got a speaking to him
[1:18:45] and he gives me some by the name of
[1:18:46] Isaac and one day God tests him again
[1:18:48] hey man cuz he knows how he's attached
[1:18:51] his family he knows how he's longed for
[1:18:53] this son listen this is what Abraham did
[1:18:55] for 25 years he sounds like no saw ups
[1:18:58] and boots and and go get a crib ready
[1:19:00] we're gonna have a son named Isaac his
[1:19:03] whole Hulk his ambition was in this
[1:19:06] thought that God has spoken to him I
[1:19:08] love you I'm gonna raise up nations in
[1:19:11] your loins as kings I've made promises
[1:19:15] to Abraham
[1:19:16] his life I'm gonna give him a child I
[1:19:19] believe Allah promised and God blesses
[1:19:22] him because God is faithful and one day
[1:19:26] after I think eight years or whatever it
[1:19:28] is God calls me says I want you to take
[1:19:30] Isaac I'm gonna test you again I want
[1:19:34] you to take the Isaac I want you to take
[1:19:36] him up on the Mount I want you to offer
[1:19:37] him as a sacrifice and this is why I say
[1:19:41] this and I hope you follow where I'm
[1:19:42] going with this I want you to notice
[1:19:44] that God did not tell Abraham to take
[1:19:47] the Isaac up when he was three days old
[1:19:48] he said what do you mean by that
[1:19:51] he waits penny wait till you get some
[1:19:54] real attacks to him
[1:19:57] listen brother Brad pump up their
[1:19:59] offering the Old Testament they get that
[1:20:01] they get their favorite pet they get
[1:20:03] whatever they used to offer as a
[1:20:04] sacrifice he said someone become a
[1:20:06] family tradition and they weren't
[1:20:09] offering their best anymore
[1:20:10] they'll get attached they'd gotten
[1:20:12] comfortable with a certain kind of life
[1:20:15] as long as they were comfortable that
[1:20:17] life God couldn't deal with them but as
[1:20:20] long as a man was comfortable with his
[1:20:22] nephew and his daddy and a bunch of
[1:20:25] blessings God couldn't speak to what he
[1:20:27] wanted to mrs. long as he was happy with
[1:20:31] Isaac and it was just all about Isaac
[1:20:33] God couldn't really deal with him the
[1:20:35] way he wanted to hey Madison so he lets
[1:20:39] him go and he takes a little Isaac and
[1:20:42] he sees there's a little baby he stares
[1:20:44] at his face oh it looks just like his
[1:20:46] daddy I'm a beautiful little baby boy I
[1:20:50] didn't think it was possible got many
[1:20:53] young again God give me a little boy and
[1:20:55] he holds that child in his arms
[1:20:56] day after day thinking about how God is
[1:21:00] blessed and thinking about this child
[1:21:02] the little boy needs to grow up but he's
[1:21:04] playing in the yard and here he is with
[1:21:06] the servants working he says you take
[1:21:08] care of the business for a few moments
[1:21:09] and he go and play with his little chap
[1:21:11] cause he's younger you do that again go
[1:21:13] play this little child running through
[1:21:16] the field little Isaac falling down
[1:21:18] skinned his knee
[1:21:19] it was Abraham he was there to pick up
[1:21:22] Isaac and wipe his tears and tell me
[1:21:25] gonna be alright we'll pray for you
[1:21:27] you'll be okay when Isaac was waiting
[1:21:31] for his mother when I began to ride a
[1:21:32] horse when I was in begin to learn all
[1:21:34] these things
[1:21:34] it was a bruh Abraham was at her loving
[1:21:39] every moment of it this is my baby this
[1:21:43] is my boy now now God speaks to him you
[1:21:51] really love him don't you oh I love him
[1:21:54] more than the world it means so much to
[1:21:56] me I never knew I could be so happy I
[1:21:59] never knew I could be so blessed what's
[1:22:01] the offer was a sacrifice
[1:22:10] what place do we give God he begins to
[1:22:13] bless us a good church a good family a
[1:22:16] good job good health we still give God
[1:22:20] first place
[1:22:21] hey man I'm speaking for myself we gotta
[1:22:24] do it every day hey man listen God hey
[1:22:27] man I'm not counting the cost listen
[1:22:30] when I come to the Lord I was a wretch I
[1:22:33] think I own three changes of clothes I
[1:22:36] had an old jump car I live in the park I
[1:22:38] had nothing to give the Lord listen it's
[1:22:42] very easy to give your life to the Lord
[1:22:43] I mean you've got nothing to lose I had
[1:22:46] nothing to offer and he took me in
[1:22:49] listen that's easy and really almost
[1:22:53] have anything today still but we think
[1:22:55] we do we come in this world was nothing
[1:22:57] is that right but it was so easy for me
[1:23:00] to surrender fully to the Lord when I
[1:23:02] had nothing to offer to surrender hardly
[1:23:05] but my own well but listen God give me a
[1:23:07] home glass must meet with a wife that I
[1:23:09] love is but before wonderful children I
[1:23:12] love them doing now can you still pay
[1:23:17] the price
[1:23:18] are you still missing I just talked
[1:23:20] about going over neither I don't like
[1:23:21] going overseas it's not that I you know
[1:23:23] just like people or anything like that
[1:23:25] listen I like my home I have my own bed
[1:23:28] I like it
[1:23:29] hey man I got my own pillow I got my own
[1:23:32] stuff got my own shower my own
[1:23:34] toothbrush got my own house my own
[1:23:37] vehicle I got my children there I don't
[1:23:39] like leaving them behind I don't enjoy
[1:23:41] one that some guys probably do but I
[1:23:44] don't like leavin though I would all
[1:23:45] like leaving my children behind and
[1:23:47] every year my wife will tell you seems
[1:23:50] like it's harder and harder every year
[1:23:51] every nurse is she here I go through the
[1:23:54] same spiel huh maybe I shouldn't go this
[1:23:56] year maybe this to be my last time well
[1:23:58] maybe will be maybe it won't it's not up
[1:24:00] to me and I like to think it is but it's
[1:24:05] really not it's true I'd like to think
[1:24:09] well you know if I it's not up to me
[1:24:11] if he come here right now and said I
[1:24:13] want you to go to Timbuktu guess what
[1:24:17] how sold out am i listen he's not even
[1:24:20] often I said I got off it was a
[1:24:22] sacrifice like that I just don't wanna
[1:24:24] leave him for two weeks but yeah it's
[1:24:28] not about you know what it is we think
[1:24:31] well I I can retain I can do something
[1:24:33] there's nothing you can do
[1:24:35] listen I think was Martin Luther and he
[1:24:37] said I've held many things in my hands
[1:24:39] in my life and I've not held on to any
[1:24:42] one of them hey man all the things I've
[1:24:44] ever hung on I'm not hold on anything
[1:24:45] right now I've never had power to hold a
[1:24:47] woman I can't retain my children
[1:24:49] I can't retain my wife but he said
[1:24:51] everything that I've ever put in God's
[1:24:53] hands I've never lost a man I'll go over
[1:24:59] there brother Brown he goes I'm cousins
[1:25:01] I don't think he enjoys leaving either
[1:25:03] he enjoys leaving the church he enjoys
[1:25:05] in America but there's a burden Eman
[1:25:08] because there's a need somewhere I've
[1:25:11] got a calling in my life and I have to
[1:25:13] account for yes the comfort able dress
[1:25:15] account for the calling in his life
[1:25:18] are you willing to lay everything down
[1:25:20] to be the friend of God I give in Isaac
[1:25:24] I give you a blessing and give you
[1:25:25] riches I give all these things are you
[1:25:28] willing to lay them down for me the one
[1:25:30] they give him to you listen Abram he
[1:25:34] didn't just lay it on Isaac everything
[1:25:36] to just offer him up you know what he
[1:25:37] did it he have an expectation he said
[1:25:41] God wanted me to promise to me for my
[1:25:44] seat government promised to you as well
[1:25:45] and then God made a promise for my child
[1:25:48] the in him my seat would be called and
[1:25:51] he had an expectation if I go up there
[1:25:53] and if I offer him up I will see him
[1:25:56] raise again listen I do overseas I leave
[1:26:00] behind my home I leave behind I'm not
[1:26:02] even trying to compare myself to Abraham
[1:26:04] I thought even the same but I leave
[1:26:05] these things behind because I have an
[1:26:07] expectation expectation that I'm going
[1:26:11] to see God do something only God can do
[1:26:13] Abraham an expectation that God was
[1:26:15] giving you something only he could do
[1:26:17] only he could raise the dead only God
[1:26:20] can heal crush the Sun only God can give
[1:26:22] the Holy Ghost I can't do these things
[1:26:24] but I know
[1:26:25] vacations but the family and the life
[1:26:30] that I've committed his hands he's more
[1:26:33] able to keep the when I'm absent the
[1:26:35] line when I'm present I'm not one of
[1:26:39] these preachers that thinks I made we're
[1:26:40] having to sacrifice my family for the
[1:26:41] ministry I don't think God called me to
[1:26:43] do that either hey man some of these
[1:26:44] some people they're all over the place a
[1:26:46] man I believe and take care of your
[1:26:48] house amen but listen we can we can
[1:26:51] never let a spouse a child a job
[1:26:53] whatever take first place from the Lord
[1:26:58] and when we do that that's when we find
[1:27:01] God doesn't speak to me like he used to
[1:27:03] I wonder why he's waiting for you to
[1:27:04] separate for a long time since I heard
[1:27:09] from the Lord looking for a separation
[1:27:11] in your life that you haven't made yet
[1:27:15] because once you separate from
[1:27:17] everything else peak to you
[1:27:18] hey man like I said I can look back to
[1:27:22] the time Abram can look back time we can
[1:27:24] look back to the time our life when we
[1:27:26] separated
[1:27:27] we knew we were giving everything to the
[1:27:29] Lord and God called us out listen that
[1:27:32] was okay for 13 years ago can I do the
[1:27:36] same thing today now listen you just
[1:27:42] still be blessed that right look Abram
[1:27:45] had silver and he had gold had great
[1:27:47] lands that right but when there was a
[1:27:49] famine of land the first seed was run
[1:27:51] out of the promised land he left the
[1:27:54] blasting hey man but I praise God you
[1:27:57] know why because when he went back where
[1:28:02] did he go - he went to the place he'd
[1:28:04] first blessed the Lord he went to the
[1:28:07] same office he built when he first come
[1:28:08] to the land and he rededicated himself
[1:28:10] and listen when you rededicate yourself
[1:28:12] like he did God will bring a separation
[1:28:15] look what was the very next thing that
[1:28:17] happened after he comes that altar God
[1:28:19] wrote a separation between Lots herdsmen
[1:28:23] and his listen got a lot of trials
[1:28:25] sometimes got a lot separates until
[1:28:28] lesson sometimes they're coming just
[1:28:30] because he's trying to get your
[1:28:31] attention he's trying to get you to
[1:28:33] separate under him amen
[1:28:38] where is he at he's where you left him
[1:28:40] listen I prayed I prayed for a man here
[1:28:43] some time ago
[1:28:44] this is a man and I've just I just give
[1:28:47] you the testimony in short a little bit
[1:28:49] but this is the man he'd been going to
[1:28:51] church and and he'd been raised around
[1:28:52] the message he knew better and I was at
[1:28:55] work one day years ago I was at work one
[1:28:57] day years ago and I was praying and my
[1:28:59] wife sent me a text said that this
[1:29:01] person's been in an accident
[1:29:02] I thought something with work or
[1:29:04] whatever and I didn't know what it was
[1:29:06] 'awesome Lord showed me I saw him in his
[1:29:08] truck
[1:29:08] and he's sitting there and he just gets
[1:29:10] he goes like this I didn't know what it
[1:29:12] was come to find out what had happened
[1:29:14] was he was he was on the side there on
[1:29:16] his truck talking to somebody he thought
[1:29:17] was broke down and somebody rear-end
[1:29:19] just pick up at 55 miles an hour and I
[1:29:22] saw I saw this happen before I knew what
[1:29:24] the accent was about it's not and I
[1:29:26] begin to pray about it
[1:29:27] and they had him in the hospital they
[1:29:29] life fighting they give him two days to
[1:29:30] live and I was praying about it at work
[1:29:33] before I knew the prognosis before I
[1:29:35] knew anything and the Lord told me he
[1:29:36] won't die but he's going to live and
[1:29:40] they're up at the hospital praying
[1:29:41] they're getting ready from the die and I
[1:29:43] text the brother that's addicted to
[1:29:44] church and said the Lord showed me he's
[1:29:46] not gonna die is gonna live he walked
[1:29:48] out of the hospital two days later he
[1:29:50] was supposed to be paralyzed the rest of
[1:29:52] his life that sounds good that sounds
[1:29:56] great but you know what happened he got
[1:29:58] a bunch of insurance money and he back
[1:30:00] slid he went and bought this he went and
[1:30:03] did that and the next thing you know he
[1:30:04] doesn't left his wife he doesn't there
[1:30:05] are all these things I got to place I
[1:30:08] was so discouraged alertly but better
[1:30:10] I'm dying why not pray about it but I
[1:30:14] believe was a purpose in it amen this
[1:30:16] same man I was a different Church and he
[1:30:18] was at this church just a few weeks back
[1:30:20] and he'd come in and he'd had different
[1:30:22] issues and this that he'd run from it
[1:30:24] and different things and he found out I
[1:30:26] believe he's got cancer some sort of
[1:30:27] cancer and he'd come up at the end of
[1:30:29] the service after the service is over
[1:30:31] and I was getting ready to walk out in
[1:30:32] the office this that he couldn't said I
[1:30:34] want you to pray with me he said I need
[1:30:36] to get right with the Lord and I got
[1:30:37] down I begin to pray with that man
[1:30:39] I said nice I quoted what I just quoted
[1:30:41] you a few moments ago brother Brennan
[1:30:42] said that he's where you left him I said
[1:30:46] do you remember when you left him at and
[1:30:48] I knew where he left about he said I
[1:30:49] left him that night
[1:30:50] well that accident happened that's where
[1:30:52] I left him at I said I know he's been
[1:30:55] back there waiting for you the whole
[1:30:56] time I said you left him there and
[1:30:58] there's something else you're still
[1:31:00] there
[1:31:01] you've gone on and you've continued of
[1:31:04] your life and yeah everything you've
[1:31:05] done everything's ever happen to you you
[1:31:07] never really left that moment you rolled
[1:31:12] it over in your mind and every day
[1:31:14] you're like in the bathtub
[1:31:15] it has consumed you and it's destroyed
[1:31:18] you you've destroyed a home your health
[1:31:21] your family your fight everything is
[1:31:23] gone you left him behind I said I
[1:31:26] believe he's still there and he's
[1:31:28] waiting for you right now we got down we
[1:31:31] begin to pray listen many of us we live
[1:31:34] back that our consecration we can look
[1:31:36] back to time God did something our life
[1:31:38] and we're still living there 20 years
[1:31:40] later hey y'all got quiet many of us
[1:31:48] never moved beyond a certain point in
[1:31:50] their life
[1:31:53] Abram never got beyond a certain point
[1:31:55] in his life till he separated Foley he
[1:31:58] come his promised land he been blessed
[1:32:00] but God never dealt with that man again
[1:32:03] until a lot was removed from him
[1:32:07] separation where the RAM says this amen
[1:32:12] that's what I'm gonna come to this have
[1:32:14] we gotten so used to living in our
[1:32:15] promise and her blessings that we've
[1:32:18] learned to live without the voice of God
[1:32:20] we learned to code well I'm doing all
[1:32:24] right I'm getting by I don't need to
[1:32:25] hear from God I'm doing all right
[1:32:26] we need to hear from God more now today
[1:32:30] then we did that night we give our life
[1:32:32] to the Lord then we did last week we
[1:32:34] need to hear from him more let's not
[1:32:36] learn to just live without it
[1:32:39] prophet says this he says this is the
[1:32:42] sermon once more timeout Sam ceases
[1:32:44] notice the church today is not willing
[1:32:47] to pay the price
[1:32:48] he said Sampson prayed the right kind of
[1:32:50] prayer Lord let me
[1:32:53] with the enemy oh my there you are
[1:32:56] you don't want to die to your pride amen
[1:33:03] this is you don't want to die there the
[1:33:05] things work let me say this before I
[1:33:06] finish the quote if you can die to your
[1:33:08] pride you can died anything I'm
[1:33:11] affirmative that's that's that's where
[1:33:13] people get hung well I can't give up in
[1:33:15] this and I can't get it's because you're
[1:33:16] too proud hey man because God said you
[1:33:19] can give it up if God said it I believe
[1:33:21] it and then that's your pride that says
[1:33:23] well I can go on this way this nut you
[1:33:25] can die to your own pride you can die to
[1:33:27] anything I believe that well praise the
[1:33:30] Lord
[1:33:31] since you don't want to die to your
[1:33:33] friend you don't want to die there
[1:33:34] things well now remember I'm talking to
[1:33:36] literally thousands around the world
[1:33:37] what I'm saying see I love to speak here
[1:33:40] in Chicago I'm speaking out the world
[1:33:42] you don't want to die but that's the
[1:33:45] only way there's a possibility for
[1:33:47] rioting well in resurrection language
[1:33:52] nobody wants to die they can't have a
[1:33:54] resurrection without a death he says
[1:34:00] this you know what he died that's the
[1:34:01] only way there's a possibility revival
[1:34:03] you're blinded Sampson can't you see
[1:34:05] that Delilah has blinded your eyes the
[1:34:08] only way you'll ever be able to bring
[1:34:10] back the strength to the church is to
[1:34:13] die to the enemy that's got you in this
[1:34:16] worldly ism being worldly is more than
[1:34:20] just oh I'm smoking drinking it's any
[1:34:22] time we attach ourselves the things of
[1:34:23] this of this world over the Lord Amen
[1:34:26] Sampson I said let me die with the enemy
[1:34:29] there is a great price to pay as you
[1:34:33] count the cost this afternoon as I'm
[1:34:35] preaching I'm gonna be real honest with
[1:34:37] you there's a great price to pay it
[1:34:40] might not seem like there's a great
[1:34:41] entry the entry fee you seem free well
[1:34:44] there's a great price to pay in our life
[1:34:45] the state consecrate there's a great
[1:34:47] price in our life to continue to walk
[1:34:50] with the Lord every day it's the free
[1:34:55] gift that costs everything you say well
[1:34:58] that's a lot to pay well he paid it he
[1:35:01] thought was worth it to pay it for you
[1:35:03] and who arena steaming lighter value
[1:35:05] than he did if he thought you were worth
[1:35:08] it then I believe the land is worthy to
[1:35:11] receive the reward of his suffering hey
[1:35:17] man you know there's a great price to
[1:35:20] pay you must die to the thing that
[1:35:22] brought you into this thing you must die
[1:35:24] the thing that brought you you
[1:35:25] Pentecostal people to where you are this
[1:35:26] afternoon
[1:35:27] you've got to die to it Samson was
[1:35:29] willing to pay the prize oh my he was
[1:35:32] willing to pay the price to get the
[1:35:35] power of God back in his life again
[1:35:39] hey man Simmons can talk about the power
[1:35:42] of God that wonder he once knew this man
[1:35:45] was willing to pay the price to see it
[1:35:47] once more he said on one of the churches
[1:35:50] this have been willing to pay the price
[1:35:52] and die with the enemy the thing all
[1:35:55] your popularity and all your this that
[1:35:57] another just to see the power of God
[1:35:59] back on you again and become a prisoner
[1:36:02] of Jesus Christ
[1:36:04] hey man listen I've told you testimony
[1:36:07] this morning I think God for those
[1:36:08] testers and they God for the testimony
[1:36:10] of the prophets meaning many you have
[1:36:12] testimonies but what God has done in
[1:36:14] your life supernatural things powerful
[1:36:18] things things that only God can you know
[1:36:19] I'm so grateful for those things but
[1:36:21] this morning I'm not satisfied just to
[1:36:25] look back and see what he's done if I've
[1:36:27] got the diary everything and I've got to
[1:36:30] offer everything up just to see him do
[1:36:32] it one more time just to seal in the
[1:36:35] sanctuary just to see him glorified like
[1:36:38] he's been alone once more
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:45] I'm willing to pay everything to see it
[1:36:47] one more time oh yeah if I've got to
[1:36:57] give up everything oh it's easy to say
[1:37:00] that I know willing to offer everything
[1:37:06] sacrifice everything I thought I am to
[1:37:10] hear from God one more time I want to go
[1:37:13] back that same Walter I was at the
[1:37:16] beginning and offer up sacrifice and
[1:37:18] calling the name of the Lord just to
[1:37:21] hear him speak one more time see you'll
[1:37:27] never understand that to get through a
[1:37:29] famine he just come out of a famine he
[1:37:31] realized you know what I'm doing isn't
[1:37:33] working anymore it's not working anymore
[1:37:37] I need another direction from God
[1:37:39] there's something left on them I need to
[1:37:41] hear his voice again
[1:37:43] merely that man could do they he didn't
[1:37:47] even really realize it maybe we don't
[1:37:48] even realize sometimes but you know he
[1:37:50] did he went back to that first altar and
[1:37:52] he rededicated himself and he called the
[1:37:54] Lord and the Lord brought to pass need
[1:38:01] to hear from him one more time I need to
[1:38:06] see the power of God in my life
[1:38:09] that's what Samson said that's what the
[1:38:11] quote says now that somebody else's life
[1:38:13] I think God I think God for ministers
[1:38:17] then I'm going to preach this I think
[1:38:19] God for men and women daughters and sons
[1:38:21] of God they've gotta answer the prayer
[1:38:23] but I
[1:38:26] one more time come across
[1:38:29] come on I'm not built to live without
[1:38:37] hearing the voice of the shepherd I'm
[1:38:42] not content just to live in the pasture
[1:38:44] I always lived there but if my Shepherds
[1:38:46] gone by green waters and he's taking me
[1:38:48] beside still waters I don't want to
[1:38:50] follow his voice when he caught on the
[1:38:58] name of the Lord God brought a
[1:39:00] separation listen I don't believe after
[1:39:04] coincidence that Suzie got done calling
[1:39:06] the name Lord Oh Lots herdsmen just I
[1:39:09] just don't believe it's a coincidence
[1:39:11] maybe you believe in coincidence maybe
[1:39:14] you don't I don't know hopefully they
[1:39:15] don't but for a believer there's no
[1:39:18] coincidence in my life because all
[1:39:21] things work together for good to them
[1:39:24] that love God to them who are the called
[1:39:26] according to his purpose
[1:39:30] listen it maybe didn't help a lot out
[1:39:32] but it held Abram but there's many
[1:39:34] things that happen in this life many
[1:39:37] things that take place and I'm everybody
[1:39:39] gonna be blessed by everything but if
[1:39:40] you're the call black Abraham if your
[1:39:43] call God will make it work to your
[1:39:45] purpose to his purpose
[1:39:47] hey man there's no coincidence it's no
[1:39:51] accident you're not here by an accident
[1:39:53] you're not some cosmic mishap your life
[1:39:56] every footstep every footfall every down
[1:40:00] city every uprising was foreordained by
[1:40:03] God
[1:40:06] we think we can go out without hearing
[1:40:08] his voice and I can't get to this church
[1:40:11] without a GPS some of these old
[1:40:15] preachers man I hear these stories
[1:40:16] they're driving here this thing and I'm
[1:40:20] about God call me in this age I'm too
[1:40:21] stupid to figure out what's going than
[1:40:23] the other age hey man I need direction
[1:40:29] we need direction and if we would need
[1:40:33] direction in the natural how do we think
[1:40:37] we're gonna make it through the darkness
[1:40:39] of language to see you with our own
[1:40:42] understanding hey you can't make it down
[1:40:45] the street with your own understanding
[1:40:48] his word is a laugh cuz your feet it's a
[1:40:52] light to your path I believe his word is
[1:40:55] not I don't believe it's just bottled up
[1:40:58] in this book I believe it's in a people
[1:41:00] I believe that they that are the sons of
[1:41:03] God they're led by the spirit
[1:41:05] they're led every day like I say I said
[1:41:08] all the time but the bible scripture
[1:41:10] says they are continually led
[1:41:11] he is always leading us he's always
[1:41:15] directing us if we could just listen we
[1:41:18] can just be sold out amen look if we're
[1:41:23] not gonna listen to no one who don't
[1:41:25] speak to us he doesn't need a babe hey
[1:41:29] man he needs a Moses needs a Joshua he
[1:41:32] needs a Caleb he needs some it's one to
[1:41:34] go that Promised Land it don't matter
[1:41:36] what it looks like he's not laying there
[1:41:37] what kind of obstacles he wants
[1:41:39] somebody's gonna follow him regardless
[1:41:41] of the cost hey man you're all believers
[1:41:48] where's the safest place she can be and
[1:41:51] the will ago that matter about typhoons
[1:41:55] and persecutions and go in the will of
[1:41:57] God
[1:41:58] look you can't lose 1/2 through your
[1:42:01] head praise the Lord
[1:42:05] stand our feet
[1:42:09] oh my well I believe I believe this is
[1:42:19] something that we can all relate to
[1:42:22] something that pertains to all of us
[1:42:24] but I really just want to challenge for
[1:42:27] just a moment as I set the end or
[1:42:30] attitude we willing to lay down pay the
[1:42:37] price to make a sacrifice that's
[1:42:43] required to hear from God or we just
[1:42:47] content to be a churchgoer your message
[1:42:52] believer play tapes at home read your
[1:42:56] buck that's all good that's fine but I
[1:42:59] believe that the same God that speaks
[1:43:01] through those things and then there's
[1:43:05] things in your life places you're gonna
[1:43:07] go people you're going to talk to we
[1:43:09] need the inspiration listen I can sit
[1:43:12] there and I can try to to witness to
[1:43:14] somebody and I can try to give them
[1:43:16] information I can try to beat it into
[1:43:17] don't I've done that before it don't
[1:43:20] work but if the Lord lay something Hart
[1:43:23] just text a certain person or call over
[1:43:26] pray for him go talk to certain just uh
[1:43:28] just just one word from the Lord that's
[1:43:32] so much more powerful than a whole
[1:43:34] sermon I could preach in my own
[1:43:35] intellect you know what I'm talking
[1:43:38] about how many times do we as I was
[1:43:42] saying Thursday miss that opportunity
[1:43:45] because we're not really attentive to
[1:43:47] the voice of God how many times do we
[1:43:52] falter like Abram like Abraham in our
[1:43:55] own strength because we're not really
[1:43:58] sold out like we're supposed to be
[1:44:03] I believe there's an altar of
[1:44:05] rededication I believe it worked for
[1:44:06] Abraham I believe it works for us
[1:44:08] Amen you're never too spiritual you're
[1:44:10] never too old and they were too young to
[1:44:14] worry just call on the Lord Lord ah I
[1:44:16] don't know I'm in this situation even I
[1:44:19] don't know how I got here this isn't
[1:44:22] where I thought I was gonna be this
[1:44:24] isn't what I thought I was gonna make
[1:44:25] the things I done made a mess of it I've
[1:44:28] got all kinds of issues it seems like
[1:44:30] I'm worse off than I was before you
[1:44:34] could call on the Lord he can take that
[1:44:38] mess
[1:44:39] bring a separation he can take that
[1:44:41] problem and speak to you through that
[1:44:44] problem the very thing it's challenging
[1:44:47] the very thing that's upsetting you he
[1:44:48] can speak you through that I believe he
[1:44:51] wants to speak to us amen let's let's
[1:44:54] speak to him for just a moment as we bow
[1:44:55] our heads Oh Lord Lord I I've been
[1:45:04] guilty at times we all have if we're
[1:45:05] honest of missing the leadership of your
[1:45:09] voice holding to our own ideas getting
[1:45:14] things in our minds I'm not consulting
[1:45:17] with you like we are Lord some of us we
[1:45:21] we can look back to that
[1:45:26] see your your mercy towards us Lord my
[1:45:29] great concern today is some of us have
[1:45:33] taken that immediate a lifestyle a life
[1:45:36] absent of hearing the voice of God
[1:45:40] because we're no longer seeking your
[1:45:44] face like we ought to we're no longer
[1:45:47] laying everything down we're no longer
[1:45:49] willing to pay the prize to count the
[1:45:52] cost somewhere in our prosperity our
[1:45:57] blessing we grew to live absent of your
[1:46:03] direction
[1:46:04] Lord I pray if there'd be one here today
[1:46:06] that finds himself in that place they
[1:46:09] find them some of the need the Lord may
[1:46:11] they come now to that alter their heart
[1:46:14] normally they call upon your name Lord
[1:46:16] may you bring a separation father I
[1:46:19] desire today I think he's one of us Lord
[1:46:21] we could just lift our hand say Lord I
[1:46:22] don't want a closer walk with you
[1:46:24] I want a greater consecration I want to
[1:46:26] be more yielded to you I want to have a
[1:46:29] greater witness in my life Lord may you
[1:46:33] help your children help that one maybe
[1:46:36] there's a word father to rededicate
[1:46:39] themselves to you Lord speak to us I
[1:46:42] pray like you've never spoken before
[1:46:45] mainly be such a conviction in our heart
[1:46:47] of the word that you've spoken Lord
[1:46:50] would take us from our lands take us
[1:46:51] from homes take us from our own thinking
[1:46:54] and our own livelihood to wherever you'd
[1:46:56] have for us to be lead us into the
[1:46:58] realms of the supernatural
[1:47:00] that mighty kingdom of God the land
[1:47:03] flowing with milk and honey father may
[1:47:08] you bear witness and we let it down
[1:47:10] every pride
[1:47:12] everything now in the name of Jesus
