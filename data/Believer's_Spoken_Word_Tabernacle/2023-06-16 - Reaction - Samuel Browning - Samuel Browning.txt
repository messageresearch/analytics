we've not only come to a place that's been dedicated that you've given to us and provided that we can come and assemble together but father our desire is to go beyond the brick and mortar of these walls Lord that father your presence Lord is right here this evening that God that we would come under that great canopy of your presence that God the greatest privilege that a mortal can have is to see you and to know you oh God to hear from you and Lord that you'll speak to us Lord and father like David here Lord tonight we're standing Lord and just Lord to behold your beauty Lord to behold you

moments in your presence will give us strength Lord to face the trials and the tasks Lord just a few moments in your presence Lord will give us the strength that we have need of Lord may you just come in a special way Lord anoint these lips of clay anoint our ears God May our hearts just be available to you tonight we give ourselves to you now Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this evening and let's look here in Job chapter 23. let's say it's just uh so good to be here and uh also our Lord willing with uh brother Mark and I spoke with sister Doris Lord willing sister Doris will be going home on Saturday and that's that's like a week ahead of schedule and you know she at first it was over a week ago where she was having the difficulties with from the left side of touching of an index finger to her nose and she was able she's been able to do that and then this past week where uh for her walking where she's been able to walk with the Walker and you know from the stroke that she's had and so uh just the the the times of difficulty is where it's just pivoting and making the turn like turning there on their left but you know God is still God and I I just I just expressed to her I said you know even from the beginning when I spoke to him I said look I I don't remember the time frame with my dad uh I don't remember that I was a senior in high school but I said one thing I can tell you I said is that there was a lot of moments of adversity and times when we when he had to press through because some of you may not have known that but my dad lost completely his speech and Lost the complete right side and God completely restored that so there's times you know and I I think that's where it's just you know even as I say that no matter where it's at during the day or time and sister Doris just comes on your heart just lift her Before the Throne of God no matter what you're doing God is a god who's he's not respective of where you're at and just continue to lift her in prayer and I told her I said when time I said when it gets rough and the therapist I said they're asking you for things I said I want you to remember you continue to keep and confess the promises of God and I said in that time you remember there's a body of Believers that love you and are praying for you amen prayers are going up amen and so we thank God for what for the improvements I just have been so encouraged and we I just want to continue to remember that in prayer as well and uh also want to just comes to my mind I don't know maybe there was a request for it but you those of you have been praying for brother uh Donnie Reagan's daughter sister Erica and there is you know she's battling with cancer and as well as brother Ron Spencer and I know there's others that I don't even know the name of but God when I pray for all those and we pray at night and devotion I say God for everyone else that's in this same battle Lord we lift them up before your throne because everyone's important you know and so in the midst of that uh she's even here just of yesterday I had got a text and I know she's got a room now but she was dealing with MRSA and so that's an infection there and some of you they're in the medical you know what that is so it's just been battles just besides the cancer that's going that's that's taking place and so just continue to lift her in prayer amen you know there's no situation that's beyond God you know when we look at that with Lazarus I think of that situation that even how they stood there even now Lord even now Lord and that's why there's no situation that's beyond God amen God bless you I don't want to mean to keep you standing but let's just read a few verses and we'll let you be seated in Job chapter 23 verse 8. job here coming in in this this chapter behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knows the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold I'd just like to speak here just for a few moments on one word reaction reaction may God bless you bless the reading of the words you're being seated I think these are just precious times the Lord gives us to gather together and to look over the word of the Lord and to take counsel from his word and the Holy Spirit to speak to us and I think that's a when we look here where job is standing you'll find that brother Branham in many of the places where brother Brandon was speaking I have heard but now I see you also find it in many places this is a one of the the chapters that brother Branham will reference quite a bit when he's dealing with this on how that job is job wanted to see God he wanted to job it was so God was so real to job that job knew there's got to be a place somewhere I can knock on his door the reason job knew God that way is because God had spoke to him God job knew God by revelation and you know there's no other way that that a person can actually know God but by revelation in Revelation itself is sovereignly given by God there's nothing that you could Merit or I can Merit that that puts us in a place that where we've merited Revelation Revelation is unmerited favor of God it's Grace that is given to you and I Grace that directs Us in in our walk and in our life and think about it how many stood face to face when God himself was standing here in the very fullness of his being and they looked right at him and they called him belzeba how many that they you know that they smote him on on the head smolding and it did nothing for them but for a little woman that had an issue of blood she touched him and it did something for her and so it shows that Revelation as Jesus would say that flesh and blood when he spoke to Peter Flesh and Blood never never gave this to you but my Father which is in heaven has given this to you and I think there is something that where we can anchor there's no other place that we can anchor Faith than in the divine revelation of almighty God when God speaks to us God just doesn't talk just to be talking God just doesn't write to show he can write when God wrote there in the in on on the on the stones there on the mount God was displaying of what he would do in the very heart of man how God would so move down upon Our Lives when the woman was taken in adultery and he wrote there in the sand he was not writing just to show he could write but through that writing was dismantling every everything that was against her and were stones and everything started to fall and so Revelation itself is so important in our lives brother Brannon would admonish us and we see that that our lives we are are meant to live by divine revelation and we need that for every every moment in our life there's circumstances that we come to that we don't know how to approach him I don't know what step to make I know I'm at a place maybe a Crossroads maybe it's in something you have before you as a young person maybe it's decisions in your life middle-aged older whatever but God I want your leadership in this matter you know we could go ahead and just make decisions on the women no doubt I'm speaking to everybody in here that there's times where we've done that and yet we've learned from those I trust we've learned from it of what it means to make decisions on the whim God wants to influence every part of our life and he cares about every detail brother Brown would say it like this and God rich and mercy he said God is interested in everything that we anticipate in God is interested in every part of our life and so when I'm looking at this here with job and job is looking at I'm going forward I go backward but I I can't perceive him and you know job actually made a very a similar statement to this in job 9 verse 11. if you just skip ahead to that for a moment he said Lo he goeth by me and I see him not he passeth on also but I perceive him not job knew that God was God and he still was God I I don't see him I cannot see him I'm looking him forward I'm Looking Backward I cannot perceive him I I I don't he's working on the left and here he is with the right bringing things forth I I don't see him but I know that God is and that's very important for everything in our walk with God to know that God is the Bible said he that cometh to God must believe that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that Faith itself is a substance and to declare that God is and then that's where Faith Can when God speaks faith has a place to begin to operate and take hold because God's desire is to come and that our faith would be so inspired in the Living God to think to raise it out of the Mortal Realms that you and I live in we've had Faith to drive our vehicles to to church tonight when we had Faith to be able to come here that took Faith but you see with the faith that God has already what's placed in our life now the coming of the Holy Spirit through God's voice it comes to do what anoint our faith it comes to raise our faith and bring it under the influence of God's faith to where that when everything else is around us is seemingly I I don't see God I I'm not seeing him I'm not hearing from him but I know that God is how do you know God is because he spoke to me I've met him I know him for who he is I may not have an answer right now I may not have heard from him in a while but I know that I've met God and I know God is alive and well and I know he loves me and I know he cares about me that's a place that we can stand that's a reaction that we can have in those moments oh my the Thunder's rolling oh my notice he knoweth I want you to draw from this in verse 10 he knoweth the way that I take so job's saying I don't I don't see him but he knows the way that I'm walking because I'm not walking this is what job is saying I'm not standing here of my own accord God sought me out and God has revealed his way to me there was a longing in job's heart but that longing God placed there just like he placed it in your heart a desire a longing for God away you might have had your start in many different places but in any at any rate there's a longing for God and job has said he knows the way that I take God's watching over me I'm walking in his provided way I know where I'm standing because I've done what he's revealed to me to do when he had tried me I shall come forth purest gold look at this testimony in verse 11 of job 23 my foot hath held his steps I love this my foot had held his steps where God has made a step I've made a step where God has led me I put my foot right there I'm following the bloody Footprints all the way Joe how how are your feet how are you standing here because my feet are standing in his footsteps I'm following his steps what a blessing you we're looking at how is job through the midst of this all standing as he's standing it's because of the humility to Simply follow the voice of God oh my my foot has held his steps his way have I kept and not declined that comes there there unto even Under Pressure neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food you catch what everything is his lips his mouth his steps everything is describing God becoming man I really was with job already happened if I can say it this way an eruption of faith in job 19 when the standing on the midst of the ash sheep there came that that strike I know my redeemer lived man and upon them and the last days he shall stand upon this Earth I know my redeemer liveth he knew God was his Redeemer not somebody else not a second person God was my redeemer that Revelation was already striking within job's heart did job have it all put together he didn't have it all put together but the longing that was within his heart there was even in job's life a prophecy that was being lived out even through the midst of this time if you consider and can think of it that even the previous ages I'm talking of the seven Church ages have not known God like God has been revealed in this generation they had no less of God they had their portion but we're living in the hour of the fullness of the Capstone revelation we're living in a time where silence is broken at a moment where God is coming and that's all a sign that the work the whole Temple the testimony of God is finished there's a body upon Earth of believers and I'll tell you it didn't matter this is what I'm gonna say it didn't matter that they they didn't have the fullness of the Revelation that we had they had the revelation of Jesus Christ in their day and that Revelation in their day was the standard against the enemy it was enough to defeat every obstacle it was enough to raise their families it was enough to hold their marriages together it was enough to bring strength in their life to where that they are resting they are waiting on us and they themselves are a part of that cloud of many witnesses they overcame by the blood of the lamb and that same Holy Spirit coming on down in the midst of this generation he had raised the standard once again it's the same God conquering right through the lives of his people Hallelujah that dared dared to stand on his word and a reaction in the face of a test or trial in the face of everything that would come on I tell you that's why brother Ram could say I believe that what we need more of is a no-so fellowship like job had I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded I've got Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of Glory divine I want to just read here in the message be certain of God and I just many of these things here just for some months and things just laying here and you know thinking about it and just you know pondering and I know it's very simple but when we think think let's look at reactions here just a moment brother remember said you know how how job had searched down his life and you know looked over his life and he had offered that burnt offering and job knew he had done everything that God had asked him to do you see God doesn't withhold himself or requires something of you that he's not revealed to you that's right but God will not reveal more until you act in obedience on what he has revealed and obedience is from the heart obedience is not a head thing obedience is just God has spoken and if God has spoke to you you say how does God speak to me he speaks right through his word and he comes right to your heart and all that it requires is simple obedience right and then more faith comes into our life so we want to have the right reaction when the word is coming to us how many believe that God requires a response I believe God requires a reaction when the word is being ministered and after the even while it's being ministered and then even after the word is coming forth listen God's going to see to it this word is not just going to fall to the ground this word will bring forth in hearts and lives I want to react to the word of God I want to respond to it is that right I want to I want to live under that reaction of the Holy Spirit moving down for this moment in our lives now notice Let me let me go ahead and get into this here just a few moments brother I'm dealing with this here and be certain of God he says oh God when a man keeps what God Said do he is certain he is God he has to answer so when he keeps what God has said do the brother saying I'm a little troubled have you kept what God has said do well I'm a little bothered have you kept what God has said do if you can stand there and say I have done what God has asked of me then you can turn around to the devil and say get behind me you see you've got an authority because you're certain he's God because I'm standing on what is revealed he has to answer Faith calls him on the scene every time when you've done what you know is right when you've met his requirements when you've confessed and made right and done restitutions and laid it before God I don't care how silent he is he is still God waiting to put that Faith there notice that he's waiting to put that Faith there you've done your Works what was our works confession repentance whatever needed to be done to make a way like we were looking at it last week an examination allowing the Holy Spirit to continue to examine and pouring over our lives so when we've done what our works what God has spoke to us how many believe that we said we got to react on God's word God when he gives his work he's expecting a reaction I truly believe that's why many times that we are not getting anywhere with God or we don't get where we need to get with God is because we don't react upon the word that's coming forth sometimes it's an altar sometimes it's hands laid on sometimes just to take that word and pray over it but whatever it is let's react to the word as it's coming forth and react in the right way because sure is the world we're going to meet the devil is that right I want to react according to what God's desire is notice I don't care how silent he is he's still God waiting to put that Faith there you've done your works now he wants to see your faith by your Works he wants to see what you'll do so after after we've done what we're supposed to do what God has spoke to us then God's waiting to see our faith how are we going to react what are we going to do now watch our brother bam goes into this if you've been anointed and prayed for God is waiting to see what you'll believe about it not run up next Sunday and run the next day and the next healer comes through the city he's waiting to see your reaction on your faith not walk back the next day and say I feel so bad I don't guess I got healed you're not fit for the prayer line in the first place you're not you're not ready you don't believe that he's God seems kind of contradictory but let's just let the Holy Spirit solve that out it's not contradictory it's putting it in a place as we're looking at last last week for Faith to be able to operate within the right channel now notice this just a simple definition of reaction it's an action performed or a feeling experienced in response to a situation or an event so sometimes it's an action other times it's a Feeling but in regardless action or feeling it's a reaction to an event or a situation notice Hebrews 10 35 look at this admonition that Paul would give casts not a way therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after that you've done the will of God you might receive the promise so in other words let me just give you the the uh the Amplified version of verse 36 in other words it's not instant mashed potatoes you have need of patience after you've done the will of God how do I know God's will his word is his will and God comes and speaks to your heart and after you've done God's will then there is the need for patience but do you realize you can't have patience unless you've done his will so if you've done his will patience is the result of God's will being done because you can stand like job flat-footed you can stand Pat and say I've heard from him and I've done everything that God has asked me to do when's the last time you heard from him uh well the last time I heard from him might have been last week but I know I've done everything that he has said up through last week and if he wants to make another step I'm ready to put my foot down in his footsteps and if he wants to say something to me I'm ready to take his word more than my necessary food more than my job more than anything else in life his word is number one in my life because God is first that's why brother Randy could tell us he said you show me a man a factory worker a housewife he said that he'll put God first in the spot of all the devil will put upon him I'll show you a man or woman that'll come out on top every time because they put God first you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not Tarry I think of this scripture this scripture has been lived out down Through the Ages you realize the prophets of old have been looking forward to this time they were not only looking forward to the time of the coming of the Messiah but there was the promise there looking for that of the new heavens and a new Earth they've been waiting on this promise they've been looking for this hour they've been waiting and you know what though it didn't come in their time their testimony was still true because they held to the word that was revealed to them in that moment it kept them pointed in the right direction kept them locked in on God in that time for yet a little while and he shall come and will not turn now the just shall live by faith oh I love that but if any man draw back that means to kind of slowly recede my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition not going back because there's nothing in me that wants to go back I may not I may not have heard from him I may not see him I may not have you know heard from him here in a moment but my heart ain't going back you know why because there's nothing in me that tasks me back to the world every bridge has been burnt behind me I'm not tied to the world but the Holy Ghost has come and I have been tied in to Christ my life is harnessed to the word my full desire is to please him what are you talking about I'm talking about ground that we can stand Pat on well think about it you know Balaam brother Brandon would take it like this Balaam saw some things but Balaam even after what God told him told him don't go in guys right I mean bayam Bala went and asked God the first time that was it whatever God said the first time don't be coming to him no more [Music] right yes that's why brother Brown was talking about you know women being preachers and everything else but notice brother Brown would take that like that and he says invade them he's seen God's clear-cut decision he saw that Vision but Balaam still went his own way how can that be it's what was in his heart but the difference with job is job saw the vision job heard from God and he had all kinds of church members can I say it like this every denomination everything coming around him that was circling around him like psalms 27 and saying you need to get away from this you need to pull away from that but job said I know that I met God Joe could stand there and say you're just trying to attack a vessel but I am not United with the vessel of William Branham I have been United with Jesus Christ and I'm standing right here my feet are in his footsteps I have heard his voice he has called my name and there's been a reaction from my soul that said amen amen amen amen you can't get me from this Vision because I'm a part of this vision it's the kind of reaction hey man and amen we're not of them who draw back under perdition remember Judas couldn't explain things foreign tells us with Judas and three kinds of believers Judas was one brother ram calls it to make Believers that stick around looking for a loophole if you want an out God will give you an out whether it's fault failure mistake Whatever It Is God will give you an out you know why he'll give you the desires of your heart that's why the prophet said be careful what your desires are just say it like this God if my desires don't match your desires let them be lined up Lord because you're all that I want like that song said you're all that I ever needed glory be to God but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul oh my job was waiting on God now I want you to notice how this Faith how Faith itself would would come because Faith itself I I love you know we're looking at even on Sunday I certainly didn't plan it that way but even as we look at Faith and you know Faith itself is a is a real um very a mystery because faith in itself the real faith that we have we're really unconscious of it because you don't walk conscious of Faith do I have enough faith for this do I have enough see the real faith brother Brown said don't do that you only make yourself upset and you only cause fluttering here but what do I do walk the same way Joe walked you can have a faith and a confidence if you have met God's requirements you are walking in God's word then you can stand there in the midst of it all and you it doesn't matter what arises you don't have to have a prayer meeting to face it you the faith within you is already present all that we have to do is get out of the way and let that Faith Master the circumstance and the first point of Mastery and the greatest point is me right is for that Faith to rise up and master Samuel because when Samuel thinks he can do something he gets in God's way is that right and you see God's a gentleman God don't push and shove like you know a group of uh of elementary kids getting in line for water God don't do that God's standing right there but when we can recognize Lord help me to step aside that you can just take the ride away you know there's a rest in that there's a peace in that it becomes a confidence right in the midst of that or in the midst of those moments now notice this is why brother Brown would take this and I have heard but now I see let me just refer to a few places I don't think I have this in there Brianna but just I want to refer to it brother goes into what when we're coming to approach God for any Divine promise he said we've got to come to that place where we recognize that we're justified in asking God for what we're asking God for now remember this is not about you know licking our spots clean because you can't get them off it ain't about that I've ever been good enough what it what how how does the word what is the working of the word sanctify them through Thy word Thy word is truth when we heed to the word of God like job did the word is there to cleanse you and I we are not here because we're worthy we're here because there is a worthy one that is bidding you and I to come and so it's to esteem his word more than your own stinking thinking to esteem his word more than your thoughts about yourself your disappointments your doubts your failures esteem his word greater you say how do I do that by acting on it believing it confessing it Hallelujah let his word take the rulership over our thoughts over our lives amen this is why we come to any promise of God we've got to have the right motive the right objective within it brother Ryan would say you want healed why do you want healed well what are you going to do with your healing are you going to serve God are you going to dedicate your life to God see coming into that place then brother man would tell us there's got to be a real reason and he said win all of that reason everything is right that is there that you desire he says your motive and objective Everything Is Right according to the will of God then that's when faith is revealed to you uh to me I love this I could say this again I love the Simplicity of the message of the hour it is not complex I don't care what people have said it's not complex it's to me is the simplest thing that is just godlying and right out here you know why because this ain't the thoughts of man this is God's thoughts our motive and our objective because remember something can be the will of God but if our motive isn't right behind it it's the same thing is it not being the will of God let me give you an example remember Simon the Sorcerer he wanted the Holy Ghost is that right but the discernment by the spirit called it up that he really didn't want it it was not a desire for God he was looking at it as a tool to advance himself instead of seeing that it is God coming to bring transformation in hearts and lives he was seeking it for self-promotion self-elevation is that right that's why brother Ben said the Holy Ghost has given out so sparingly in the message the token why because of motives and objectives behind it will it make your marriage better it will will it make your home better it will will it do a lot of things really good yes but when you get it on the inside it won't matter what's going on around you it won't matter with any situation you've got an acre in the midst of that time and that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's a change where a second daughter of God can stand right there in the face of adversity and say I know that God is I'm standing where his feet have stood oh my so when all of that's right then faith is revealed to you over the same I haven't heard anything yet do what he said do and then you're in position for his faith to come is that right what must we do to be safe repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall not maybe receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the same with every Divine promise when everything is lined up with God's word not just doing it because it's right but doing it because my heart says amen and then the amen comes to the amen oh my oh that ring sounds so good I'm glad it's fallen in here too aren't you oh my no wonder that that that Amendment James would refer to the patience of Job the patience of Joel because patience itself it it waits for God's word to be fulfilled I I want to go move on down sister Brianna right there to be certain of God and I think it's paragraph 46. I want to just read just read there I'm trying to come down here he says you know he loves to test us now he's not talking about a teacher Professor he's talking about God he loves to see the reaction of your faith he said did you know that God likes to see how you react God bless you Sister Patsy I miss that God bless you God likes to see how you'll react so you mean God Is Watching Me Yeah job you've been wondering where he's at he's been watching you the whole time God was standing right there now job knew God was he he knew God was right there right I can't perceive him when I look to the left or look to the right foreign you know why would he say forward and behind left to right because God was all around him that's where job was seated job had a revelation of Revelations 4. Jonah and there had met God when that Revelation and he knew my life is surrounded if you can see it tonight when you have been born of the spirit of God you are inducted into Christ but holy spirit baptism there are the throne guards right around your life there is that of the eagle the man the ox and the and you know the line what is it it's all Christ and whatever the need is he'll inspire you to react the right way yeah sometimes it's true out like a lion where you stand right there and then there's other times where God wants us to sacrifice our will sacrifice our thoughts sacrifice all this and it's still just as much God as when the lines roaring and then there's times where God brings us in the situation and it comes the wisdom of man not a man here but the Holy Spirit operating and giving us Direction in our lives and then there's times where there's situations where he says don't listen to this no more get caught away whether it's healing whether it's unbelief whatever it is he catches us Away Joe knew where he was standing I'm surrounded I'm surrounded by him I may not see him but I know where I'm at I have met God and I am standing in him God lets you see how you react God was watching job oh brother Branson when you say oh Lord I believe you Thou Art My Savior I believe that you're the Healer I believe that you're the one who gives the Holy Spirit and the things that I'm requiring you are the God who gives that and then when you confess all your sins and promise God that you'll do if he'll let you get well then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere God can't use that that's the wrong reaction you see when everything's been done that's the time to stand what am I standing on you've heard from God right I mean if you're on the job and they and the employer tells you do this do this do this do this do this and you do it what do I do do what's told you to do and then wait on further orders to come right right it's really it's just a simple obedience it it gets God's attention to think of it God can't use that there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you because he only Answers by faith all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but real true Faith stands there being sure that God is and be certain that he is and if God asks this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it faith says that he is can't you see faith faith is hearing from God and acting upon his word I know that's very simple but sometimes it's it's simple things that we we let go it's that that's Faith so what does it do then hearing and then acting upon it what does it do it allows that Faith to increase oh my God I got to get somewhere here he is gone if God asked this thing to be done to confess your sins and forth for it so forth you've done it faith says that he has it's certain it's going to happen your request has to be granted and brother Bram says oh I hope you don't miss it if you're sure God God is sure of his word he's only waiting to test you I've got to move on down here just trying to move into this place here now in another place here be certain of God in the July of oh wait just skip some of that and Brianna thank you she does such a wonderful job sometimes she's really got to hunt and search for me because I've got a lot in there don't get scared I've just skipped a lot of it but I've preached it I want you to think of this in the message brother Brian would preach this over and over very short very simple message be certain of God and that's just how simple God is just to reveal just to walk in what he's revealed blood Brown says walk in the light as he's revealed the light and watch more light unfold to you right and so here you find the little woman the little widow woman uh that was there in then zeropath there the mill Barrel drying up The Crucible she knew she was on her last cake she knew it but you see where she was standing at she was standing with a confidence in God there there was there was a reaction that even even it was a reaction that while before Elijah come think of it that God commanded Elijah said I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you God never told Elijah she only has one cake when you think that somebody has something to sustain you you would be expecting more than just one cake right but you see God had everything so arranged now notice blood Ram says it seems strange when a person has done all they can do that they have fulfilled every request that God has asked them to do and still is silent I think that's a very good place to examine it's just like within every situation have you done all that God has said do see it doesn't matter even how much counseling you could set with me one-on-one but if you it's something that if you haven't done all that God has asked you to do then nothing from here will go forward you've got to do all that he's asked you to do all that he said in your word and God's that personal He makes himself known in that way you don't listen there's things that you we don't need a prophet we can go right in the word and God's word will speak right to our hearts God will come right through the pulpit it'll come right while you're putting on a tape God is a personal God when you've done all that God has requested you to do I just want to get a few points here and still he's silent just be just be sure that you know God and remember faith is silently waiting he's only testing your faith to see what you'll do God does that think about the Hebrew children they didn't have an answer God God didn't answer them they had a prayer meeting God didn't answer as a matter of fact even as they're standing there getting ready to like you know be thrown over no answer God's silent but what's he watching the reaction he's watching their faith in that moment listen I want you to understand this how simple that God is bringing this that is not trying to make you conscious of your faith God is trying to bring us to a place to walk unconscious how do I walk unconscious by our life being lined up with God then you can walk with like brother Brown said that God spoke to Joshua in Joshua chapter one I I will be with thee as I was with Moses he said that was equipping Joshua he could go with a reckless faith in other words well do I do this and do I do this and what God has said Do no hesitation that's why Joshua he didn't have to have a prayer meeting when he went out there and he saw them the the man standing before Jericho Joshua didn't say man I don't know who this is I I mean I need to go to your prayer meeting no this is an opposition whose side you on right I've come out here to pray and seek God's will he drew his sword whose side of you on he said as captain of the Lord's host am I now come in Joshua submitted himself before God in that moment why he already had a promise no man shall be able to stand before you it wouldn't have mattered if that man standing there in that form was eight feet tall God said there's not a man that will be able to stand before you glory be to God there was a little boy One Day by the name of David that still believed that promise and believe that this land is my lamb and believe that Israel is a covenant people and he looked at Goliath and said no man shall be able to stand before me why because he was identified with the same God heard the same voice made the same requirements he knows the way that I take faith is silently waiting we're gonna have paragraph 26 when you've done all that you can do when you come through the prayer line and been prayed for your heart doesn't condemn you you're living right with God just hold on to it God has to answer he's testing you if you turn loose the next morning well I'm no better I guess there's nothing to it then you haven't didn't have faith to begin with if you've got real faith you'll hold till the last breath gone from your body you're certain that God is God well how could that be healing depends on what avenue that God wants to heal you we can go right back to the four anointings again right I mean even when those who are responded under the anointing of the holy spirit in the oxtime they gave their lives it was just as much victory as when David stood there and brought down Goliath that was a testimony in that moment that I don't care if things aren't going their way they're going to stand for me this is why in Hebrews 11 all the scriptures in Hebrews 11 do not point to people who were absent of death but there is many who said they would not accept Deliverance they were offered to be set free and removed from this torture but they said we met God and I know where I'm standing with God if you're going to take my life you can't do it unless God permits it but I know where I'm standing what is that that's the caliber of the DNA of God's Gene coming down through time and the Holy Spirit pulsating through that life yeah you don't think fear trying to rip a hold of them sure it did but there was something listened to me there was something on the inside that when fear wanted to rise there was something it was like the whack-a-mole at the fairgrounds it was there to put it back down the only one talking about guacamole okay you got real faith you'll hold till the last breath gone from your body you're certain that God is God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and if you're certain of God you can take his word for anything he says if you're not certain that he's God in this Bible you better be careful what you're doing but if you're certain meet his requirements then Faith takes its solemn rest Faith can't be based upon the shifting Sands of man's theology Faith takes its solemn stand upon the Eternal Everlasting Rock of God's Eternal Faith they're at rest unmovable it knows that God is God and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him I'm not going to read this next whole quote because it's brother Bram just in a different message referring to it but I sometimes I like the different uh glimpses that he gives into that everyday life of that woman of therapist she continued brother Brown said she continued praying talks about reaction sometimes there's times of prayer that are so awesome and then there's times in prayer that it's a real Pro persevering right there's times in prayer that we don't feel God like it other times his presence and it's not something we have to work up but see it's even in the midst of that that God still hears it might be silent you may not seem like well I don't I don't seem like it seems like everything's going wrong or it seems like this remember brother Bram talked about when he was going to go pray for Georgie Carter and he says here I am he says I got up there on the hillside and you know I started praying and a man he said all of a sudden my knees and the prickers on my knees and these things started buying and bothering in all of this and all of that and he said what it was is just Satan was trying to disturb me now brother Simon what are you saying well I'm saying like this if my knees start hurting I'm getting set in my chair all right and in my chair then I'll go lay on the floor but I'm going to keep praying now I may not I may not have it may not be a big rushing moment but you know what I know he hears me how do you know it hears you because I've done what he's asked me to do I made right whatever he asked me to made right I'm standing with in him so even though I don't feel it the reaction is he's still God I'm his tried amen listen brother Brian says it like this he says when you know uh Rihanna's a few paragraphs down there and Elijah in the middle offering he says when you know you've met his requirements and you've done all that you know to do then Faith doesn't waver because what what is it faith is finding its resting place in God's word so your your emotions can tell you a lot of things but faith that says this is what God has said I'm standing in what God has said so that's ground that is unwavering this is my emotions my emotions can waver but in that word and God has spoken there there is a solid place so notice it then Faith doesn't waver I want you to think of this it just sits still and thanks positive that's what faith does it thinks positive and knowing whom I have believed I'm persuaded and he said oh God doesn't hear your prayer well I know I know he's heard my prayer because I'm right in line with a sacrifice I'm right in line and you know what a double just stay around just a minute here his prayer is open his ears are open to the upright oh no no no no don't leave his he heareth the prayers of the righteous and I'm not righteous in my own self I am righteous in the blood of the Lamb you can point as an accuser but you ain't moving me from this vision I know where I'm standing and this is my reaction let's spell our hands Heavenly Father thank you Lord for your mercy tonight God as we stand here Lord oh how I just our hearts are warmed by the simplicity of your presence
