the father anything in my name and I will do it Lord there's no greater name that is given no greater name that can be named under Heaven Lord No Other Name Lord that father where there is an authority within it that God every sickness has to Bow every sin every situation there's no there's no spirit that can stand before that name Lord and that's the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and Lord as you see these needs and requests and different ones Lord among us that Lord not able to be here Lord father dealing with sickness in their body we heard that request Lord with sister Stephanie even thinking of sister Barb thinking of different ones Lord as we just kind of survey and look around the congregation Lord we're so thankful that you're our high priest and that you can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities where're thankful that Lord that we are given a promise that by your stripes we are healed now Lord may you Minister Lord to everyone Lord that father right

maybe with Lord different ailments in their body that doesn't prevent them Lord from being and gathering together but they all they need a real touch from you Lord now I pray that Lord that you'll just come in a very special way and minister to every one of these needs Lord there's many spiritual needs we've come here Lord there are many needs Among Us Lord and father we're not ashamed to say we're needy we're not ashamed Lord to say that we need more of you lord lord there's leadership and direction that we need Lord in our lives there's decisions that Lord would lay before us oh God we want to be influenced by the Holy Spirit Lord influenced by Your Word Lord we know that you will not make that choice for us that decision but oh God May the angels of God lord as they've Tak taken their post and positioned in this building this morning your children Lord Sons and Daughters of God we have gathered here Lord with a purpose to hear from you Lord God that our lives would Lord be surrendered and given to you that we would we leave out of this place Lord we're a better people than when we came in Lord drawn closer to you and with a greater desire to draw closer to you and Lord I ask that God that you would just come and minister to every need lord lord for a man that's impossible but for you Lord you're more than enough and will you just come Lord and take us as one unit together speaker and hearer oh God once again come down lord and perform a paradox Lord anoint Lord our lips Lord to be able to speak and our ears our hearts to hear and to receive May Lord Our Lives be further changed Lord we want to just give ourselves to you now Lord granted Lord open our hearing Lord I pray in Jesus precious name amen amen amen God bless you amen if you'd like to turn with me and the uh Book of Luke and I'd like to read a few vers of scripture beginning out of Luke 18 and verse 9 and amen I'd like to welcome our visitors there God bless you and uh amen and and brother Eddie it's good to have you amen it's so good to see you and um so we uh just so grateful Amen to be here and amen we like to say we had I want to say we had just a wonderful time uh the brothers breakfast yesterday and uh brother shanee how many was it was there 18 and uh so it was just a wonderful time and just um I know uh brother Shane certainly appreciate him planning that and and putting that all together and so I think that certainly is it was a blessing and there'll be more to come and we'll just put that on brother Shane so I really appreciate that how he got that together and U I know for the sister ISS when they have their times together I think that's so it's so good it's so beneficial amen don't you love Fellowship yes amen don't you love to to hear from others yes sir amen and to just hear what God is doing in different lives and it's just it's something so special about getting together amen well let's read here in in Luke chapter 18 and verse 9 the Lord Jesus is speaking here on prayer and he says in verse nine and he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself notice he went praying to God he was praying with himself that's good God I thank thee that I am not as other men are wow what a way to pray extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican you know we may not use those words in that way but if we pray for other needs in a way to where we look down on others that's the same thing there you go yes sir it's it's how we're praying that remember brother B would tell us there with the message the token it's very something that is very very simple but remember he says that we apply that token with love and consideration believing it is going to take in effect that's what's going to take in effect on lives verse 12 I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess and the Publican standing AAR off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smokee upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner and you know that's that that's all he had to do it's when God when God touches a heart when a heart just is completely surrendering to God Lord I'm nothing without you lord lord be merciful unto me I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be a based and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to uh go ahead I'd like to speak once again and moving into that on overcoming hindrances and just within the the subtleness and if the Lord will help us I thought I might be able to get out of this of Pride today and get into another point but uh just how the Lord has has taken it and we'll just we'll look at it and see but I I want to just just hone in upon these thoughts of it because when we're looking at hindrances we're looking and I want you to think of it as the Lord's been taking us through this with traps and things that traps are not things that are are noticeable they're not things that allog together that that stand out or else they wouldn't be a trap but a trap is meant to to capture sometimes you can capture a person for a period of time and what it is is to hold us back from the promises that God has committed to our lives sometimes the way that those traps would work you know it can work to where that it'll hinder a person from where that as they're on their walk and their Journey with God and they can just get just get hindered in a way to where they're they're not going all the way as they as they should and what God is drawing in their life begin to wonder what's taking place and you know let me just say this that Satan's duty is always to try to throw us off track in any way that he can he'll use so so many different things to try to to try to come at us you know uh sometimes he can use things of of family he can use a lot of other things and just I want you to understand this it's the simplest of things that if he can do just enough to sort of take and change our attitude about things and it can just begin to affect and how that we're looking even at other things it actually hinders the working of the Holy Spirit from moving further in our lives cuz he the holy spirit is gentle he's a dove is that right when God represented himself in that he represented not only in that of the Lamb of the meekest of all the Earthly creatures but the Heavenly Creatures the dove is the meekest of all and he represented within that and so then there is also the part that even as we in our walk with God and after God has done such a full work within our lives our Nature has been changed but there is continually ongoing uh in our walk with God we realize that we have been uh ordained to to walk as as a channel to walk as an available uh uh Source unto God when he said I am the vine ye are the branches and without me you can do nothing and so God's in desire is that we would be as as as the branches that he through his life moving through us would bring forth the fruit that he desires to bring forth and Satan remember if there's anything he can do to to hinder that in any way uh he'll he'll do that and we we you know we can we can be content with a place of looking at and saying well I know that you know I I no longer I don't desire the things of the world and I know that you know my in in in my life I I know that where I'm standing walking with the word of God but yet when when we're when we're looking that within our lives sometimes we can become complacent in in our walk and not recognizing that you know God's wanting to do so much more there's so much more that God wants to bring forth and wants to move within our lives and and we can start to you know just kind of become acceptive of just I'm just going to be average but let me just tell you there's really no such thing is average because the scripture tells us in the Book of Revelations concerning this age that we're living in it's G the Lord Jesus speaks in that age the amen and he says I would that thou word hot or cold that's right I don't want you to be lukewarm I want you to be on fire or be cold you got to be one or the other why why would he say it that way because we would look and say well lukewarm is at least you know it's it's closer to hot but Luke wars in the middle and and that's and that that can be the greatest trouble for a life that and brother Bri would actually say it like this he says we find the greatest trouble Among Us is trying to live between two different desires and it can become such a you know such a pull and such a trying to walk a balance but you know what a blessing it is that not only when we can give ourselves fully to the Lord but then also just allowing the word every day and it just look it's just real simple in a way of just saying God examine my life if there's anything that's out of line in me Lord Lord I want it to be straightened out guide me Lord to that to that place if whatever if there's anything that's hindering you from working in my life Lord forgive me show me Lord I I don't want to be I don't want things to be a hindrance I want you to have the right away and I think that's the greatest desire and when I I look here at this uh this setting that we've read from here today and we look at how that God can take just an example of one person that can come before the Throne of God and God can take this I mean it can be a life that God will touch right in a service and they surrender their lives and their hearts to God and and when they do that their life has been changed but then you can take you know where others a person can look and they look and think well you know I'm pretty good and and the Holy Spirit dealing with their life and you know telling them you know calling them to a to a deeper walk and you know God does that he could call things out sometimes in his Mercy he'll call things out specifically then there other times he doesn't call it out specifically in in as far as across the congregation but it's just a way that you and I know he's dealing with us personally and we know exactly where he's going in our life it's almost as though it's wrote on the screen and there's a map to it but yet it's so personal yes it is and and God he works in a in such a manner like that but what it matters is is then what we do with that at that point of do we at that moment say Lord Lord I Surrender Lord I give myself to you lord lord be merciful to me because truly it's his mercies that would even make known to us our weaknesses friends I I I want to be ready that to me the Rapture is what means everything we are living in the end time we are living in the hour to where we're not looking for promises to be made this is the hour for every promise to be for fulfilled we're living in the end time we we we've received our last sign we're we're standing with the last message and here the Holy Spirit right among us there is nothing greater to come there is certainly more of him and more of his life to come into us he's but he's right here Among Us in other words we have access to all that we have need of in order to be ready for the Rapture and so I want to just start out with it looking at like this there's always a right criteria to judge and examine our lives and I'm just telling you this takes to be able to stand and to look at the word of God and to allow the word to examine Our Lives we as Priests of God we want to stand before the urum we want to stand as they did in the Old Testament and recognize this is God's urum that God has Vindicated this word he's made it alive and not the thoughts of man but I want to know Lord even with situations and things that would be uh coming to my life I want to know what you think about it Lord amen I want to see what you think about I want to see do the lights light up on the word of God is it something that I have to make an excuse for or Reason out I tell you we're living in an hour where reasonings are to be cast down we're living in an hour that where there's a there's a people upon Earth to be able to rise into a place to say God I want the word at all cost I want to live and walk in the victory that God has provided for me at all cost how many know it's going to cost something it'll cost more it's re more is required of us now than it was even a month ago even a year ago more I'm not talking about necessarily more works I'm talking about more yielding more diligence more sincerity you see even when we we look at this here uh uh in the message of prisoner I want you to watch how brother Bram takes this he says don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform Miracles right we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have of the word but always judge yourself look back and taking inventory of what kind of a fruit that the life you presently live now is bearing that's 1 Corinthians 13 is that right then you can speak with tongues of men and angels and not have the love of God the love of God is the Holy Ghost it's the word of God is that right then the same thing we're having such a knowledge of the word of God yet without the love of God it's nothing the love of God is everything and the love of God it's not our human love it's God's love it's the Holy Spirit coming down and changing our love our human love can only go to a certain level right right it it can only go there but one came down from glory in order by Divine love in order to express his love the Bible said he commended his love towards you and I he projected his love to you and I he demonstrated his love he he who was not guilty the worthy one took upon my sin my shame thank you jesuses I mean friends look you couldn't put a finger on his life true you couldn't put one finger on his life so him he was indeed the promised lamb the Messiah and he took upon willingly think about it he took upon the whole sins of the world present past and future he knew every mistake you would ever make thank you he knew every failure you'd ever have thank you he knew he listen because this the lamb was slay Revelations 138 in the mind of God before the foundation of the world that's where the sons of God were shouting for Joy when God took job back from his trial and said let let me show you what is above and beyond the situation you're in he took him back to his mind and showed him when the sons of God were shouting for Joy you know what he showed job he showed job that your destiny is certain because of your origin so the in between is not going to change where you come from or where you're going it's going to be there's going to be some hard Pathways along the way but what were you shouting about we were shouting because we saw th salvation in the Lamb of God you say how can I say that that see that the same way that you can see yourself in Christ now you come into His Spirit into his being that was there before the foundation of the world and it's come all the way down that's right and the part of that salvation was to see as the prophet goes on to say the embodiment of deity once again in humanity praise the Lord so always judging always judging ourselves Looking Back Now I don't know I don't think any one of us that's really comfortable to look over and examine our lives for errors I mean I every time I ever read a wrote a paper for school when I wrote it you know you're correct I mean at least when you're now typing in on computer I felt really good about it then you had to take it in for peer review you take it into peer peer review and then you had somebody else reading it and and what's incredible is that sometimes the way that we could read things we will read in words that we didn't put there yeah that's right that's good and somebody else begins to look at and say hey you're missing a thought here and and you jump from here to there and it all makes sense to us but then when it comes under a peer review but let me just say this to you and I we're not under the review of one another yeah yeah right that's why Paul said it's a light thing if I be judged of you I I I'm being judged and I've got to stand before him on that day it's the word right now that's judging our lives but to look back over our lives and and really look and say God and looking back through our lives and you know what friends if not for God's grace we wouldn't even really be able to look back over our lives in the right way yeah yeah that's right you know what this is about honesty yeah come on now we're living we're living in an hour where the anointing has it's galing upon this age and there is there is a lack of honesty oh sometimes even in not telling people the truth that they need to hear that's so good yes patting them on the back the Bible said they have itching ears but but honesty I'm talking about honesty honesty that that when I'm talking about this is honesty it comes from God's Own Heart I I've got to get moving here on this but you know there's a there's a tension I'm trying to get to a point here there is a criteria and there's a tension that rises in our hearts as Believers when God has gotten a hold of your life before God got a hold of your life you and I were SLO alongs yeah that's that's so true we just slap alongs but when God got a hold of your life got a hold of my life then there comes a tension in our lives that's good and that tension that comes is like like the belt that's that's upon the the pulley in your car that drive belt if a pulley goes bad or a belt goes bad I don't care how how nice the vehicle looks it ain't going nowhere it ain't going nowhere I don't care I don't care you can have all the heated seats you want you can have where it would you know all you can have all the specs you want but it's got to have that tension and that tension itself is is where that every moment the prophet says am I pleasing my Lord oh if I could just hear from him yeah I don't know about you but that's how I feel yeah Lord if I can just hear from you if I haven't heard from him I I I want to know is there something going on Lord is there something going on is there something that in me I I want to know that he can speak and he'll speak to us in a variety of ways but I want to hear from him if I didn't hear from my wife I think something's wrong if she didn't hear from me she would think something's wrong he wants to hear from us we're not just Affiliates come on friends it's we're living in a time where the marriage of the Lamb has come amen is that right every moment so it puts attention on you it puts you on guard now watch this that so that's what really makes us what we are it's attention am I pleasing to my Lord that's so good that's so good how Paul writes this Paul said my desire this is Paul's purpose be found in him yeah not having my own righteousness now this is a man right here meeting God face to face he's had a true experience with God already but look at look at his whole demeanor my desire is to be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that is so good and the faith we're talking about that's revelation God revealing himself to you and I Lord I want to walk pleasing to you Lord my desire Lord show me even listen friends just daily it's a simple thing even daily as we start our day Lord guide my feet today Lord make yourself Lord real to me you know what lays before me I've got plans but you know what is ahead of me Lord my plans can always be interrupted by you but you also know the decisions that are Before Me Guide Me Lord and make Lord make yourself more real to me today Lord Lord give me more Lord of your spirit today Lord God let more of Samuel be in it out today Lord God that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead now what Paul is speaking of here remember the Bible tells us blessed is he and that has part in the first resurrection I I don't listen let me I I don't want to be a part of the second Resurrection because the second Resurrection is now where it's come after the tribulation after the Millennium right after their of of the of the wedding supper because the wedding supper is going on while the tribulation taking place three and a half years yeah right here we are at the wedding supper of the Lamb cuz that's for the bride and groom right is that right think about it it that while while enjoying at the wedding supper of what's going to be taking place on Earth listen there's little glimpses of it that has already been coming down through time floods that have taken place you see the horrors of of situations where it just it's just one thread one threat from Anarchy one thread from things just turning loose right you say why hasn't it because the Bible tells us in the book of Thessalonians he that leth will let until he be taken out of the way it's God that is in control amen the Bible tells us that that Mighty angel in Revelations 10 he descended with an open book he put one foot upon the land and one put up on the sea is that right raised his hand and he swore to him that liveth forever and ever that time should be no more so there is no beast power that can rise up and to take away the Bride of Jesus Christ until every name that has been written in the lamb section has been called brought forth splashed beneath the Clorox bleach sealed by the spirit of God then the Rapture comes and while all of while we're there in the wedding supper well friends you don't want to miss that you say what's the need the wedding garment you got to have the token you got to have God's own life God's own life see that's why we're judging in our criteria it's not about things we think God the gifts have their place in the church but the gifts are not the emphasis it's a life that is beating in harmony with God's word where there is a soul that says Amen to the word of God is that right our life Paul Sates Amen to the word now think about what a contrast what a contrast so this is where Paul is talking about in verse 11 he said I want to be part that's what he's saying in verse 11 out of I I don't want to remain among the Dead I want to be raised out in that first resurrection that's my aim that's right what are you what are you saying brother Samuel I I what I'm saying is you don't find a man though he's entered into God's rest but he's not living aax life that is so good yeah that's such a that's such a balance we rest in our soul yes and then we have to press because this thing gets lazy easy uhhuh yes it gets lazy easy this thing gets lazy easy it does that's why brother Bram I could give you many quotes I give you one quote brother Bram said so easy for Christians to get lazy and not read and pray as they should now when I read quotes like that I don't read quotes like that as though that it would allow me or to encourage me in a certain way it God God drops little things along the way way to remind you and I you are but flesh I know you are but flesh but let me just tell you it's my grace that's brought you safe this far and it's my grace that's going to take you the rest of the way it's my grace that's going to deal with your life that's going to bring correction to your life that's going to even allow you to look back over your life and not look at it and say I can never I'll never make it but be able to look at and say Lord I failed here I failed there but your Grace has shown me that Lord make my footsteps straight Lord before me hallelujah hallelujah amen I believe that's bride material friends to be able to stand and look at the mirror of the word and to stand with courage there cuz we're promised like Caleb I want to take my Mountain I'm here to take my mountain and I want need to look at the word God I want to see every one of those virtues operating in my life by the spirit of the the Holy Ghost going down in my life I want to take my Mountain amen hallelujah my I'm trying to get somewhere now verse 12 not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after that means pursue if that I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count means I think not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before how many know there's things you got to forget and and what I mean forget it's not just bury him and ignore him I mean take it to the blood of Jesus Christ whatever it is Take It Before the Throne of God and say Lord God if anything whe if it' be a hindrance it' be a Feeling if it be an attitude if it be sin Lord God cleanse me Lord that I can run this race I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus brother BR says it like this he says you know in the one place on images of Christ you know he says I'm interested in one thing that's more of the Holy Spirit to take over William brandham I'm not interested in joining a greater Church than what I belong to I belong to the real Church of the Living God the firstborn I was born into it now now if you catch this real carefully now the prophet is laying out a pattern that within our lives we desire to be closer to God and he's letting us know that there that as he said he said I don't need to go join some other church I already belong to that church it ain't talking about a building we're talking about the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ which 1 Corinthians 12 is the body of Christ by the spirit of God which is the word he says I already belong to it I didn't I didn't sign a book you didn't sign a book but it was by spiritual baptism inducted into the body of Jesus Christ so is making it available to us so it isn't like something that is just you know I've got to I've got to go over here to some certain place and I got to go no he's letting us know it's right here Among Us and he says and here it is I want more of the holy ghost in my life to reflect Christ who I love I don't care what plane or level I have to come on to get it I I don't care if I have to go here or there or be called a fanatic H roller whatever it may be I want more of his life to be reflected oh my there's things that God can deal with your life and all of a sudden Satan will whip right up next to you and say now now you've been brought to a Crossroads what's so and so going to say when you get rid of them Instagram posts and so and so say when you're no longer shacking up in that kind of a way and laying those certain things aside I'll tell you what you need to do say you know what I've got God on my side and God has stood with his word I'm taking my side with the word of God because that's what means more than anything else I want to be closer to God I want the promise that God has made for me I want when I look at it I want the promise of rapture I want that I want to walk in fellowship with him don't we all oh my notice I want more Hallelujah I want more of his life to be reflected in me true now notice as he goes he says I'm not interested I'm not interested in the plane I have to come on I'm not I'm interested in the Holy Ghost so I can be more of a servant like he was so this isn't about Lord I want more of the Holy Ghost that I might have a greater Ministry I want more of the Holy Ghost that Lord that that I might you know be be used more for this or being used more for this no I want more of the Holy Ghost to be more of a servant like he was that's what separated him from all the Pharisees from all the rest of them they were too big to deal with the menial matters in people's lives they forgot their purpose and their calling to be a part of the priesthood they are set aside not for their own selves they've been set aside to offer gifts unto God on behalf of the people now think about it you and I have been brought in to the priesthood now now being brought in a royal priesthood we brought in by the spirit of God so now to be a real priest is no longer to live a life for self it's offering on behalf of others even as we come together sometimes we don't feel like clapping our hands but we're priests sometimes we don't feel like worshiping well brother Samuel I want to get in the flesh I got news for you you've been in the flesh for however old you are and sometimes what you have to understand is you've got to make your flesh obey that son or daughter of God on the inside that's taking some jurisdiction you say what can happen from that I'll tell you what can happen from that that might actually be a showdown in that service where more of God is able to move into your life and there's an overcoming strength that comes into your life to further recognize that thing when it wants to creep up again and Grace for you to be able to stand there and move beyond your own feelings that's true I'll tell you if we can do that right there man we'll be doing real good that's the truth we'll be doing real good I said will will notice this I'm not interested in the plane I have to come on I'm interested in the Holy Ghost so I can be more of a servant like he was he was the Lord's servant never come to be served or to minister never come never come for he to be ministered to but to minister he took the place of a servant and if the king of Heaven could do that where the members of his body let's all be likewise not be different but humble ourselves in his presence no matter what the world has got to say intellectual people thinking nothing about it just receive more of the Holy Ghost and be like Jesus humble meekly lonely take his place tell people off no that wasn't in there and he'll take yours at the judgement wow say Lord I want more I want more yeah I I want more of the Holy Ghost I want more of him amen I I believe that's what we've been brought to within this hour more of him the more more I can yield myself and surrender more of his presence I feel in my life no wonder Paul when he would write even in First Corinthians chapter 9 about how that we're to run this race that even those who would run the race Paul would talk about it one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain it you ever had guys that run with you you know you got to do your conditioning and things like that you got guys that just they're just pacing yeah they're just pacing you find somebody you can Pace with but then you find others that they don't care what everybody else is doing on the team or whatever more they're running because they may not be running for a gold medal or something but what they realize is the more that I push myself the better that I'll be in the conditioning right so the reality of this sometimes that there's things even in Running of this race it requires a little bit of pushing of ourselves a little bit of surrendering ourselves come on friends we're living in such a time where we are feelings and listen pressures are greater and they're only going to get greater our feelings and things are not going to become easier we are living in a complex Nur erotic age we are living in a time when the very lid of hell has been taken off in Revelations chapter 9 it speaks of that of how you see all of these demon Spirits that's been released here upon the Earth is that right we feel you s sometimes you don't even know what's taking place and it's just pressures that are congealing Darkness that's all around us we so it's not going to get any easier but in the midst of it say God help me in the midst of this time I want to be like those in thara when the Bible says of how that they came into such a time of darkness and the way that they responded to it was with increased service unto God in a time of great Darkness God let him know I see your faith now ain't incredible places before that when he speaks to pergamus when he speaks to uh you know to that of Ephesus and other times he'll talk about his faith but but then he turns around and commends them on their faith you say well don't I have whose faith is it well it's his faith that comes in to move upon our faith but you see how his faith moving in our faith it isn't that he's going to come down and do everything for us but his faith moving in our lives it's just like between a husband and a wife that love affair that can can can exist it causes that wife man just to move and to operate there within that home in such a way she's able then to reach back out to the husband and the husband you know reach beond different things you know and helping out in other areas so many things that'll work together why because of A Love Affair so that increase of service was all under the administration of divine love so good anybody say help me Lord help me Lord amen so notice whoever runs is temperent in all things there's certain things that you won't eat or drink or go certain places certain athletes or whatever more they won't do that because they do not want to hinder performance but you see if we're not careful we can become so inflated in our minds of well I'm the elect nothing can face me nothing can hurt me you know if I'm predestinated I'm going in the Rapture I will also remind you if you're predestinated you'll live like it you'll walk like it yeah your life will show the outworking of of predestination is that right where it moves to to push us Beyond things listen friends all those different thoughts can come right around our lives but there is a love affair on the inside you know it's like how the prophet said tell me he said one person that has never come in contact with the love of God but doesn't want more he said you want more you want more of him you you Delight in more of him Hey listen friends if a drug addict can all of a sudden take that aent or met you know uh meth or those other things that's out there and they just from that one little thing and they're doing that to try to escape their realities and how that Satan would offer them in that way and it can move them in such a place to where it will cause them to sacrifice their families it'll cause them to sacrifice relationship positions and everything else oh and that's the perversion how much greater is it when the Holy Spirit would move upon a person's life it will cause all you become a real true addict of the Holy Spirit Lord I need more of you I just can't get enough of you that's what the Bible said in the book of Acts that the bans addicted themselves to the word of God true and that's kind of addicts we want to be yeah oh lord lord I need more I need an I needed more Lord I need more Lord of your spirit Lord I need more of your life Lord I need more of you Lord God that's totally contrary to the Pharisee who was only looking at where he was and looking down on others and yet here you had this other one standing right there couldn't even lift up his eyes Lord be merciful to me a sinner we want more of him don't we so notice God God would would speak to us in regarding this service and how that we in ourselves would put on that Garment of humility notice the scripture says that that you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder y all of you be subject one to another now notice how God writes this he just doesn't write something in his word without giving us the opportunities for this to be practiced now you realize when we're talking about practice we're not talking about like like how it is when you practicing before a game you know it don't matter if you miss a shot but in a game it's a different story that's not practice that's a real deal right but I always thought how our coach always taught us he said boy he said the way that you practice is the way that you'll play if you practice half-heartedly you approach it half-heartedly that's how you'll pray he said CU there ain't no magic button on Friday nights that turn it on and all of a sudden you get out there that's true but see when we're talking about practice God gives us maybe the better word with a practice part of it is opportunities God will do it with the young ones submitting to the elders in so many different ways so many ways to be able to just you know just just be able to Humble ourselves in such a way cuz sometimes how it is when we're young I mean we know it we you know we we feel like boy don't get quiet on me now I mean we we feel that way we feel like you know we don't man you you don't understand you don't understand and and you know and and here God gives us opportunities for this to be developed in our lives to submit to the Elder then he goes on for all of us as well to submit ourselves and be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you thank you Father so this this whole phrase that Peter wrote under under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit the early church would have understood what he was speaking about according to the words that God would have him to choose it spoke of that of a servile garment yeah that's right of one who is there to serve now you know a servant doesn't get a choice of what he's a servant to he doesn't get a choice to say whether or not you know I bring my slippers uh can you bring me my meal uh can you bring me a cold glass of tea can you do this can a servant is a servant is that right so in other words it's not just one servant looking around say no I don't bring tea I bring the slippers and then this one over here says no I don't bring slippers I just bring tea now there is a lot of times could be different servants but what I'm getting to is that you or I do not get to choose I mean we have a choice but the things that God will allow to come AC crossed our path to determine whether or not we are going to have that garment to be a servant in our lives or whether we're just going to lay that aside no I'm not uhuh I'm not uhuh uhuh I'm I'm not giving place to that but we don't get a choice we don't get a choice of how of how that we serve when someone's done us wrong we don't get a choice on that of how that we conduct ourselves we don't say hey I'm taking that off right now I mean I don't know we we can't I mean I can't take off the Holy Ghost you can't take it off when you've really been born of the spirit of God you can't take it off but but you and I when he's clothed our soul we can override things Oh yeah and when we override it it never works right in our own lives because in our lives we're not made to operate with self we're not made to hold and harbor grudges and feelings and all of those things and you know the reason those can exist there is because that we feel like we're right they're wrong yeah there you go what a trap what a trap wonder why the prophet would spend so much in the message dealing with this very thing on many times what we think is what hinders us when we think we've got a right to get back at somebody the spirit of God takes its flight when we think we're better the holy spirit is just grieved he just pulls away from our lives the dove cuz he's timid I say God help us friends without the love of God in our soul how how are you how could we have a Fighting Chance you understand how could we have a chance without him in the midst of our lives so this is why that Paul would write put on therefore as the elect of God sink into like a garment as as the elect of God holy and beloved bow of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering I'll just say Lord take me deeper when Elijah threw that garment back remember God did not tailor the Garment to fit Elisha it's not like you or I receiving a suit from somebody else and we put it on and say man it's it's all right right here you know it it fits pretty good around here but the sleeves are a little too long that's not how the Holy Ghost works we do not alter the spirit of God which is the word of God they're one and the same we do not alter that but God works to alter Our Lives to fit his word and then putting on we find that phrase over and over in the New Testament Ephesians 4 where we started a lot of this service it this series it deals with sinking into look this is the greatest thing friends if we can take this and run with it and apply it oh my if you see something in your life if you see something along the way say oh God take me deeper Lord take me deeper Lord in you don't be ashamed to tell him that but say Lord take me deeper Smite you across the chest Lord take me deeper Lord I'm willing I want to stand right now this is the Judgment that we and I will stand before I'll never have to stand before the right Throne judgment by his grace because there's already been a sacrifice that stood on my behalf because because remember the Bible tells us in the Book of Revelations it does not mention one thing about blood at the white Throne judgment it said there were books and books and books and books that were opened Deeds Deeds that were done but no blood wow wow this is why when the Rapture comes the picture's been taken let him that's holy be holy still that's bride going in Rapture let him that's righteous be righteous still that a foolish virgin that here of church that's left right let him that's a wicked and things like that the picture is taken there there is no movement in the tribulation for the Gentiles it is during that three and a half years that Israel receives their visitation of the finish of Daniel's 70 weeks there you go right three and A2 weeks which are years is that right and they get their visitation of the two witnesses that step out what two witnesses the same that was there on Mount Transfiguration that appeared when Peter James and John stood there Elijah and Moses Moses representing the law and Elijah representing God's justice but oh aren't you glad that there was one who spoke up in the midst of that time and said hear ye him this is my beloved Son this is the one who met what the law required this is the one that has met God's justice and has walked through that tribulation of fire that brassy judgment and his life coming to you and I oh my that's what they'll Minister Moses and Elijah under that anointing to the Jews they'll call them to the true atonement the Lord Jesus himself will slip away from the white Throne judgment and and slip right back down and make himself known as Joseph made himself known to his Brethren is that right now can I have just a little bit more it don't sound real strong let's look at this here on Pride versus humility I thought this is I thought this is really really incredible I don't know somebody sent me this or something I don't I don't know when but I got to I was I forgot all about it I was looking back through my pictures the other day I was actually looking for a different picture and I come across this thing and I was like my goodness I don't know who sent it but anyhow it's good but I want you to watch this with pride this is one of the things with pride pride focuses on others failures it's self-righteous overly critical and fault finding why in order to make yourself righteous you've got to find somebody that's beneath you wow yeah looks at their life through a telescope but others with a microscope it's true looks down on those who aren't as spiritual or committed as they are M we only had badges thanks they know who is truly proud and truly humble that's incredible cuz remember David's brother eliab when David came to the battle and asking who is this guy that's calling out remember what eliab said I know the naughtiness of your heart pride is here you see what it is he's Discerning and it's not really discernment no true I mean he's Discerning you got Pride that's why you're showing up the truth of the matter is elab had the pride that's right he had the pride he wasn't going to walk out there but neither was he going to surrender to somebody else who had a little bit more faith than he did right notice how the prophet said it over and over he said if I didn't have the faith to walk where Enoch walked and somebody else did I let them walk on I'm not going to hinder them we want to walk on we want to be an encouragement to somebody else listen God is so set that in the body in such a way that and there is a diversity of gifts and if we're not careful this is what happened in the Corinthian Church the Corinthian Church and you look at that and you say oh they were so carnal if they had not been carnal in that way how would we have had some of the teaching that we need but they had so locked up to such a place they had those saying I'm of sephus I'm of Paul I I'm of Apollos and the other said I just push play with Christ I'm of Christ that they just they're just separated in that way they were so separated and Paul had to let them know hey wait a minute why is there division why is there Schism why is this among you amen we are one body amen it's God that plants it's God that Waters it's God God that gives the increase he leads one to sew leads one to water and it's God who gives the increase but see how Satan can so work in there so subtly in such a subtle way thinks everyone is privileged to have them involved look at this with humility realizes here's what humility is realizes how far they fall short and have overwhelming sense of their need to grow anybody else feel that that way yeah every time Lord I I feel the need to grow compassionate and forgiving amen looks for the best in others yeah seeks to win people not arguments that's so good realize is only God knows a person's true motives there you go yes sir I can look at actions but I'm not going to try to be a prophet when I'm not that's right God knows their true Moes but but I know this but listen I want to believe the best for every person brother Samuel you might be wrong I would rather air with Grace than be guilty of condemning under law without an opportunity to rise and get right is that not what the prophet said even in a marriage he said if both of you can't see eye to eye give in he said it will be shown which one is Right In Due Time Glory but sometimes our our flesh is we have got to win this argument we've got to win this point and we're humble when we're doing it nobody as humble as us leaves the Judgment of the heart in God's hands Glory thanks they don't deserve the opportunities that God gives them amen it don't diminish it grows greater and greater how true these things are how true and you know what it takes it takes the spirit of God to help us to see these things cuz cuz ever so easily there can come that of even just very quickly here let me just try to bring some of these points in it can come ever so quickly remember how God talked about a proud look he said in the book of in the Book of Proverbs he don't like a proud look that he would talk about in the scripture there in Proverbs 21:4 and how look and a proud heart now I want you to understand this when God has sealed that Soul by his Spirit you've got to take your heart and that heart has got to follow what's in the soul that's so good this is why that when we come Hebrews 4:12 the Bible tells us the word of God is quick alive and a discern of the very intense of the heart why we are heart we want our heart going the right way because listen our soul can be so so settled with God but in our heart there can be so many other things that we can start taking in Pride can come in negativity criticalness all those other things just as much as unconfessed Sin can come right there in the heart and yet that life is sealed with the spirit of God but once that heart has been brought right back in line with the soul then it's a Channel glory for God to use Glory Glory so we want all of that we want it all lined up that's what God is dealing with our lives that it would all be lined up we want our hearts to be discerned notice brother B says it like this and humble thyself he says you know he says I though I understand all the mysteries of God and still though I could do and have not charity I'm nothing I've got nowhere yet the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it amen so there's no way to Humble ourselves to that place without under the operation of the love of God God working God moving God melting our hearts Now watch how he says this he said surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you now I wonder why he would say it if it wasn't possible remember when when they built the tabernac how coming back from Babylon they built the temple right Ezra and N here they come back Ezra comes back when the Temple's built and then the temple begins to be operative and then God brings back Nehemiah nehemiah's building up the walls of Jerusalem so everything's coming right back in order and Nehemiah stood there he was not a priest but he was a governor there's times where you and I have to stand as a priest and there's times we got to stand as a governor he has made us Kings and Priests unto our God right and Nehemiah stood there because there were some who were coming up next to the walls in the time of the Sabbath or the time of rest we know that rest to be the Holy Spirit to you and I they were coming up there and they were wanting to sell fish they were wanting to sell things that would be pleasant trees to that of those inside of the wall and Nehemiah said you're not even going to come up to the wall walls if I catch you around these walls again there will be retribution that's a temperate life I don't want to see how close that I can get to the world I don't want to know how much of it but I want my life to be free and clear for God to operate I don't want hindrances in my life I want God to be able to move because I'm expecting a move that's going to move me from this Dimension into that Dimension don't let an arrogance Spirit come around you it can get right around us it can come right around now brother brand it's amazing when he uses this terminology arrogant arrogantly and just this message humble thyself you get a chance go back and listen to that message and he deals with what can be such a key trap of how things can come about if one of the things can come about is how that we would look at others that don't see what God has shown to us that's so good and remember you and I did not did not open our eyes to see what God has done and is doing in this day God didn't we didn't do that that was that was the elective Grace of almighty God as a matter of fact no doubt some of us sat right here and it's gone over our heads gone over our heads all of a sudden Our Lives it just man we realize my goodness what what's taking place what it's all about I'm a part of it God's grace to you and I but he would talk about that arrogance over and over where it has a arrogance itself is one who has an exaggerated sense of One's Own importance or abilities and brother BR would deal with that of how that within that that arrogance of how that it would come in in such a way and one of the traps is is when somebody's done something wrong and brother Bram say it like this when we think they're wrong sometimes people have done things wrong anybody in here ever done anything wrong maybe only five of us six of us but so sometimes it comes to bring this over we're tested see we don't get to choose when we have that Garment of humility on but if something this is how we should be this is how honest we should be if there's something that when someone either brother BR say it over and over right down through this message right here and he's dealing with that arrogant spirit if it's something that somebody's done something wrong or even if it's something that we think is wrong they may not even done anything to us we just think it's we just think it's wrong that's right I think that's wrong and Satan can come right around in that area and we wonder well I wonder why I tell you they they need to change this they need to correct this they need to do that boy bless God that person's so wrong and if we're not careful instead of realizing no matter how how wrong a person could be or even of something that we think is wrong if we don't take it to God and say Lord let my attitude be in the right place if it's not then we have not in the favor that God would have us to be and it could become prideful I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why that brother I don't know why brother Brian made the decision like that I don't know why I mean you should have just I mean I I have no idea and it can just come so easy I don't know why so and so I don't I don't know why so and so I don't know why I don't know why this is you know sung like this I don't know and and and all of a sudden it becomes to such a place to where we're looking down on others that's around us now friends I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news but I'm just going to tell you the Rapture is going to be the culmination of God's crowning achievement in our lives and I'm going to tell you that that that is going to change every bit of Our Lives it not only going to make us young people again but it's going to change it'll take all the buttons out of our life than it'll take the buttons that we have that others push right and we're and it'll take away our fingers from pushing others buttons that's you say why would God allow that for humility to be displayed because you and I were Unbecoming so Unbecoming was it for our lord Jesus to come down and Adorn a body of Flesh I want you to think about it in this hour of the culminating work of the promise of God how unfitting was it that God himself would take and use a little simple vessel it didn't even have a seventh grade education and God would use that to speak to you and I friends that went beyond anything of arrogance it went beyond all of that how that God would stoop down in such a way to so deal with our lives so brother samon what are you saying well until we get out of here and as we're gathered together right now oh brother Samuel if I don't I tell you what somebody rubs me here I'll go somewhere else well listen it don't matter where you go it don't matter where you go now it don't matter where you go you're still going to have to deal with you it don't matter there'll be somebody else that'll rub you a certain way and all if you can we can understand what that is it's not about if everybody could just be like me I mean it would just be such a it would be so wonderful that's not God's design God's design is not that we would all be the same but his but his program is that we would be one yes and one with his spirit with his word and him working through a many membered diverse body wow that's amazing yes sir and all of our temperaments all of our makeups all of our this all of our that you know what that's why I'm not trying to change anybody I'm not trying to change one person of how that you sometimes how you think or how you approach listen as as a Shepherd God's given me Grace I know the sheep that I P Jesus said I know my sheep by name we know the characteristics God's not a cookie cutter God he knows how to work with every one of us and I'm glad he does it in a certain way aren't you I'm glad he knows how to work with us he don't try to work with little Aaron like he does with Paul he don't try to work you know with one of these sisters like he does another sister but yet it is the same almighty God let me tell you what that is that's humility yes that's humility sometimes the Trap that we can get into is such an easy trap is when something has gone wrong or something is how we'd think oh that I don't know if that should have been done I don't know if that should have been ah that I don't think that should have been said it wasn't saying that we should just sit all around but you know what there's things even some things that I've had to you know it's from far away kind of dealing with and things like that and and I look at it and the things I've just approached with different ones I've said look here's what you have to understand you don't know exactly what the heart of that brother is you have no idea what he's going through you have no idea the pressures that he's under that is so good and this is what I said I said I would rather ER on the side of Grace then be one who's going to stand there and say this and this and that and there might be things that I don't I don't see I don't agree with but Grace itself is so great that it can override and bring healing I said sometimes it can be healing that's needed deeper maybe in a person's life that is so I would rather ER that way I say God help us if there's one thing friends listen when we can be guilty of as a church oh God let us be guilty of that I want I want to look and see the best in one another how can you say Brother Sam you ought to be preaching with fire if I can't see that there's diamonds down there I believe with all in my heart that the people I'm preaching to we're going to spend eternity together you might get mad at me sometimes when I step on your toes but there's a reason because in my heart God has dropped in my heart I know inside of there is Sons and Daughters of God and we can make it we're more than able to overcome hallelujah hallu hallelujah hallelujah GL be to God in the highest hallelujah hallelujah let me just let me just stop here praise God I think we've I just feel in my heart the spirit of God we've it's it's clenched where it it needs to be thank you Lord hallelujah that last part with pride can be so it can be so subtle is where Pride itself can draw circles Pride can just draw circles and pride will cause that Circle that starts out you know when God first got a hold of your life it's so big man it's so big it's like you got to take a telescope to see the person on the other side that's right you need a you need a rocket launcher to send to pass a ball to them but all of a sudden if we're not careful that that Circle can start getting smaller and smaller and you know what's incredible is we understand in our lives that we're to separate from all unbelief is that right we're to separate God leads us that see that's God leading Us in separation in our own lives in our own walk with him but what we have to be careful with one other trap is like I said when we see something wrong sometimes it might be of how a person maybe something they're seeing something they're looking at in God's word something of that you're looking at you're you're seeing certain things listen God test us there's certain things that I've seen here in the past few years that I thought Lord I thought we wouldn't see again and I just in my heart just keep it in my heart of things just just thought wouldn't we would we you know we were we we' God has taken us of certain things of certain battles Beyond certain things but I begin to realize is that the same spirits and we're tested in so many different ways and one of the ways that we can be tested in so subtly is when someone doesn't see something eye to eye the way we see it and God can allow us to see something it isn't that we're anything but God can allow us to see something we can see this scripture see this quote can see all of this right here but what God will look at is what's our attitude towards it how do we look at it I I'm I'm telling you I'm preaching to myself and I look at that and I say God when I look at these things I don't want to draw that Circle smaller I want that Circle Lord to be bigger is that how you feel cuz if we're not careful it's like they have one one interview of of a certain Rabbi and the rabbi speaks out if there's 20 me and my son will be in it if there's if there's only 10 me and my son will be in it if there's only five me and my son will be in it and if there's only one I'll be in it yeah see he draw that Circle so small isn't it incredible how then we our faith is to be in a place that if there's one that's going to be taken out of here in a Rapture that's going to be me that's our faith but not to have a pride to where we look at it that I'm the only one right if everybody was like me in this church if everybody did this and friends you don't realize that there can be certain little things look we're going to see little shortcomings in one another right are you hearing me in one another but let's make sure that we look at the mirror as well too cuz if you don't look in the mirror you might leave out of the house and you got your shirt on backwards come on I know a number of people that's happened to I'm not going to call it their name you got to look at you got to look at yourself in the mirror I got to look at myself in the mirror we can't just look way right out there and look when we see other things it's like I told you with other things that I could see that I could see that it seems like this is going off a little bit right here and it's taking this and putting emphasis over here a little bit like that and I look at all that you know what it brings me to a place to do when I look at it first of all I said God let my attitude stay right let my heart stay right with what I'm saying brother Samuel do you discuss it no no because let me tell you something just because somebody listen to me very carefully just because somebody can be a little off in one area doesn't mean they're off all together right and if you go to start talking about all those things what if I brought my boys in and talk to them about certain things I don't do that I don't do that in my home you know why because that God can use men of God that maybe there's certain ways and certain emphasis and this and that God can use them to help them that's true I don't want to hinder that do you I don't want to hinder that I say God help us help me Lord help me to have the right attitude help me to have the right Spirit Lord help me not that there might be something that God can test us with that's something that we might see in the word of God and maybe there'll be a little brother that would stand right here and maybe there's something that he would say that's just not it just shows that maybe is not read further in the message right it's like I had a brother had a brother here some years back and he was he was speaking on the Holy Ghost and so after the service we got out and and we were talking and I took him for a bite to eat and we got there talking and then we begin to look and I said uh we got to just kind of fellowshipping on on some of the things I said have you ever have you ever heard this quote have you ever heard this one no Brother Sam I said I said brother BR says this over here and this says this here well anyhow it opened it up to where that what he was speaking at that point there was more light upon the holy ghost that's so good so that it's not two separate things you're not born again and then you get the Holy Ghost but it's one subsequent event see it's tracing it all the way down through but God gives us Grace it's how I approach now what if I would approach that brother and said you know what what in the world was you talking about tonight but you know what there's a lot of good things you said and I'm not going to tell you his name there's a lot of good things he said no he he walked away from the truth or nothing like that good very good brother faithful brother but there's just sometimes there's certain things and listen I would want somebody to do that to me I would want somebody to say brother samel have you seen this quote have you seen this scripture have you looked at this have you considered that I would want somebody to do that for me I want a brother to help me but God help us help us help us not to where it becomes now it just gets such a place and if we're not careful that circle gets so tight to where now it go goes down and it's now just us and these 10 then it's these four then it gets down from these four and it's just us and our family and then pretty soon why does our family need to fellowship with all you all wow and then this family it gets down so tight to where they can start looking at one another yeah that's good it gets so tight friends I'm not talking about looseness but I'm talking about when there's differences and how we look at things even in the midst of wrong we're tested on our attitude I say God help us that is so good I know this may not be a shouting message but I say God help us if God will give us Grace it'll give us the strength that we need to ply our hearts for hindrances to move out of our Lives let's just pray anybody want to be remembered prayer yes I do I sure do let's pray for one another Heavenly Father Lord Jesus sometimes Lord the ways that you as you come and you speak to us Lord you help us Lord so so deeply Lord what you've asked for us Lord even here today it can apply over and over in our lives Lord humbling ourselves to you is Lord when the word has come across Lord our pathway when the word of God has dealt with our lives in our hearts what do we do at that time Lord we want to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God lord as you deal with us and you speak to our hearts help us Lord father as I thank Lord as your Prophet tells us this bride being a word bride she must be Tried by every word of God and Lord I pray that Lord Jesus sometimes lord it's not so much about Doctrine but Lord we're tried in our character of how that we will approach certain things sometimes Lord when someone Lord is maybe they've they've done something wrong something that's very offensive to us Lord that can cause that AR against spirit cuz Satan is an opportunist he'll come right around his whole objective he doesn't care it's him that's doing it he can cause Lord somebody to say something that we think is wrong he can have something to be said it could offend us that's one thing now what what do we do from that point Lord it can become a trap in our lives a hind hindrance it may not even be something we'd ever say out outwardly Lord knowing there's many other quotes and scriptures right here laying before me but I believe you've already spoken the whole continuity of it your Prophet would say it over and over whenever you think you're better than somebody else whenever you think they're wrong now obviously Lord there's times when there's things that we can see what is wrong it isn't that everything we're going to look at and say oh I'm just going to ignore and it's everything is right no that's that's not what it is but sometimes Lord how that we approach it in our own lives will we look down at that person look down upon them Lord disassociate dis disfellowship hold him at arms length Lord sometimes it isn't even in body it happens in families help us Lord you permit these tests and trials you permit these things to come our way now Lord may you help us give us Grace that's what we're asking for to submit ourselves Lord more fully to you Lord help us these are These are times Lord where you can come in and move in a greater way in our lives help us Lord as we take inventory help us to look at our own lives examine our own lives Lord looking back over them help us Lord I pray Lord when we've seen wrong or we see certain things in a certain way help us God help us Lord not to have the wrong attitude Paul would even warn those Lord in the Corinthian Church of how that knowledge puffs up but charity would edify someone may not have a certain understanding yet when Paul would speak about a weak conscience he spoke it wasn't that that was a weak person it was simply that they lacked the understanding at that time Lord help us that our lives can be so conducted by the love of God lord our heart's desire like we open this service we want more of you we see the contrast with the Pharisee and the Publican the Pharisee was in himself so thankful he wasn't like other people but Lord God that Publican couldn't even lift up his head there wasn't Lord any any arguments that he had he just he smoted his heart and said God be merciful to me a sinner and his heart his heart had been opened to you the other one stood there I don't know maybe he might have even prayed such a long time I don't know but his heart was not open Lord that's why you come Lord service after service time and time again is that our hearts might be open to you Lord Lord help us Satan Lord God is continuously working Lord trying to Lord with all kinds of smoke strings and distractions and things Lord to get us away from that place of really reflecting in our own lives Lord [Music] Jesus when those astronauts climb into that spaceship that on the Launchpad they begin to look at every one of those instrument struments that are there and they begin to check and double check they examine all of that they have been through it time and time again [Music] Lord we want to look at that little dial of attitude we want to look at that little dial of Pride we want to look at that little dial Lord oh God remember us Lord Lord Jesus that you would come and speak something so personal so tender to our lives Lord and call us to a deeper Walk with You Lord examine my life Lord examine my life Lord Lord if there's there's anything in me Lord if there's Pride there's things Lord that oh God throughout the time and the years that you've brought to my attention and through situations oh [Music] God examine Lord examine Our Lives Lord help us Lord granted Lord help us Lord I pray pray Lord I ask this morning if there's one that doesn't know you in that real way maybe Lord in their heart they can say to you Lord I want that love that's so much deeper that spoke about it's it's deeper I want that love Lord in my life I want that love Lord that has been spoken about I want you to have the uppermost seat in my life Lord I don't want my way I want your way Lord I want that strength that's able to stand there Lord God the love of God in my heart a strength that's able to pull my heart in line Lord and when others Lord when I would see wrong or see something that I may not I may not agree with or maybe when I've been wronged Lord give me a love that love Lord Jesus that you've had for me I I don't have to look to nobody else there's a lot of examples but I can look in my own life like Paul could speak to the Thessalon nikan church and say you are taught by God on how to love I think about it Lord how many times that you've come to me when I didn't deserve it Lord how many times Lord that father in different one times Lord that maybe in my thoughts just not right where they need to be perplexed maybe frustrated things Lord that would move how can this be but Lord God you would sweep [Music] down and you would convict me oh [Music] God help us Lord help us Lord to be more tender we live Lord God like Isaiah said Lord I live among an unclean people situations all around but oh God tender us Lord tender us Lord I pray help us Lord I Thank Lord God you know as I was just talking with you the other day many miracles many things that Lord that I've been privileged to see you do healing and many things seeing lives change Lord filled with your spirit and I've watched Lord God even when it would come to Healing if we tar long enough we'll get sick again but Lord what could be the crowning achievement is the love of God having its perfect way in our lives help us Lord I pray help us Lord Lord Jesus we commit ourselves I commit myself and this congregation into your hands Lord we're nothing without you as a pastor as a minister I'm nothing without you lord as a Congregation of people we're nothing without you lord God we need you Heavenly Father Lord give us Grace I pray Lord Not only would you just continue to reveal of yourself more to us pouring out of your spirit but Lord give us Grace to walk temperately Lord taking Authority with our attitude with our [Music] feelings each of these things Lord God give us Grace Lord may you minister to every need Lord fill every heart Lord to an overflowing Lord oh God grant it Lord more of you Lord is my prayer give us more of you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen could we [Music] stand let's just take let's just take just a few moments here he's worth he's worthy more than just a few moments but think about it even a even after we leave out of here out of his presence continue just to pray and so let the Holy Spirit just deal with our hearts on these things oh just may me more oh [Music] Jesus make me more yes Lord I want to be

has called us he's the one who comes in to fill our lives and as he would deal with our hearts there's things that God can say so specifically and we know just exactly where we're at that is so true why don't you just just take this moment right now and just invite him just to water that on in say yes Lord yes Lord I'm going to lay aside that Pride that that particular area of my life the very thing that God going to be asking for is the plane that you have to come on say Lord I don't care what plane I've got to come on I want more of you Lord just invite him to water it in as we're
