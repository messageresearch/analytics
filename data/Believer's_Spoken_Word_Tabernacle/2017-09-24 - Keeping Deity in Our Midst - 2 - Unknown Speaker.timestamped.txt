[41:22] amen
[41:25] let's go to Exodus chapter 17.
[41:31] verse verse 8.
[41:50] Exodus 17 verse 8. I I'm gonna go ahead
[41:53] and forewarn you I did not send them my
[41:55] notes today because there's just so much
[41:59] and uh that doesn't mean I'm Gonna Keep
[42:02] you here it's just there's so many
[42:03] points of when things and I just want to
[42:07] I just just want to do it go about it in
[42:10] that manner but there's so much here
[42:12] that within this in every part of the
[42:15] word when God gets a hold of the word
[42:17] there's so much within the word and you
[42:19] know the objective that we have is not
[42:21] that we try to squeeze every every last
[42:24] drop out of every scripture out of every
[42:27] word but we want for the season and for
[42:30] the moment what God has for us
[42:33] amen because if God tarries God will
[42:36] bring us back into these places and
[42:37] we'll visit them again
[42:39] is that right when when God made himself
[42:42] known to to Isaac Isaac did not go
[42:45] around and start digging new wells
[42:48] is that right when God revealed himself
[42:51] to Isaac see this is the difference when
[42:53] God revealed himself to Isaac as he did
[42:57] to Abram I am the Lord God of thy
[43:01] fathers notice he did not go start
[43:03] another well
[43:05] he kept digging he went back and he dug
[43:08] the same Wells that his father Abraham
[43:11] daughter
[43:12] and he didn't try to call him a
[43:13] different name
[43:15] he called him the name that his father
[43:16] called him
[43:18] why because the what that same God had
[43:21] been revealed to him and so he knew and
[43:24] this is where we stand here we want to
[43:26] dig in the same Wells that our father
[43:28] has dug in
[43:30] understand we want to dig in the same
[43:32] Wells when God has sent a message in
[43:35] this hour we don't have to create new
[43:37] wells
[43:39] we dig in the same Wells
[43:42] amen because in there is water
[43:47] Hallelujah that's a separate thought but
[43:49] this is powerful
[43:50] amen
[43:52] verse 8.
[43:55] then came amalek and fought with Israel
[43:58] in referred him and Moses said unto
[44:01] Joshua choose out men I like that you
[44:06] told Joshua choose out men
[44:10] Glory it's the holy spirit that selects
[44:14] that selects and brings forth his
[44:16] children
[44:17] these what these men are to do go out
[44:20] and fight with amalek
[44:22] tomorrow I will stand on the top of the
[44:25] hill with the rod of God in my hand
[44:27] so Joshua did as Moses had said to him
[44:30] and fought with amalek and Moses Aaron
[44:34] and her went up to the top of the hill
[44:37] and it came to pass when Moses held up
[44:40] his hand that Israel prevailed and when
[44:43] he let down his hand amalek prevailed
[44:46] but Moses hands were heavy
[44:50] and they took a stone and put it under
[44:52] him and he sat thereon and Aaron and her
[44:56] stayed up his hands the one on the one
[44:59] side and the other on the other side and
[45:02] his hands were steady until the going
[45:04] down of the Sun
[45:07] and Joshua discomforted amalek and his
[45:11] people with the edge of The Sword and
[45:13] the Lord said unto Moses write this for
[45:16] a memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[45:19] the years of Joshua but I will utterly
[45:22] put out the remembrance of amalek from
[45:25] under heaven and Moses built an altar
[45:28] and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi
[45:32] for he said because the Lord has sworn
[45:34] that the Lord will have war with amalek
[45:37] from generation to generation
[45:40] amen
[45:42] we want to continue to look at the
[45:44] thought this morning keeping deity in
[45:46] our midst may God bless you as you're
[45:49] being seated bless his word
[45:52] I want to touch on a few places here
[45:54] from from last week
[45:58] and um
[46:01] as we look here
[46:05] the that which Moses
[46:08] was holding
[46:10] there in the air
[46:13] the scriptures in verse 9 say it refers
[46:17] to it as the rod of God and we've seen
[46:19] of how that in Exodus 4
[46:22] it was a rod
[46:25] that
[46:26] Moses had in his hand
[46:29] from the shepherding of the sheep and
[46:32] tending to flocks when they were there
[46:34] in the wilderness
[46:37] and there's no doubt about it Moses had
[46:39] no idea
[46:41] that God was going to take a simple
[46:44] stick
[46:44] and use a simple stick
[46:47] he had no idea but but God works he
[46:51] hides but he also reveals himself in
[46:54] simplicity
[46:56] you think about it how many times did
[46:59] uh shamgar walk over the ox goat he
[47:03] didn't know where the ox code was at but
[47:05] in the midst of that moment the ox gold
[47:08] became more than just an ox goat
[47:11] it became a tool in the hand of a son of
[47:16] Abraham who was yielded to God who made
[47:20] the Covenant and the promise of God
[47:23] coming through that yielded vessel took
[47:26] an instrument
[47:28] and drove back
[47:31] thousands
[47:34] and brother bam takes that short little
[47:36] scripture in shamgar is because samgar
[47:39] got to thinking
[47:41] he says shamgar got to thinking about
[47:43] his family he got to thinking of I've
[47:45] planted these crops and about the time
[47:47] the crops are being ready to be
[47:49] harvested here they come and yet here
[47:51] God comes along and get and shamgar
[47:55] begins to remember that he is a son of
[47:58] Abraham very very much the same way with
[48:02] Samson in Samson's life you know he here
[48:06] he is in the midst how many times maybe
[48:08] he's walked over you know I don't want
[48:10] to say he's necessarily walked over that
[48:11] Jawbone of an ass over and over but to
[48:14] say that maybe when he had maybe looked
[48:17] at it before if he had looked at it or
[48:19] saw it or whatever it was things that
[48:21] would be common then and something you
[48:23] would say see laying around but in that
[48:25] moment there was a need that arose
[48:29] and it was God that directed him because
[48:33] Samson nobody would have thought about
[48:35] picking up the Jawbone of an ass and
[48:38] going out there to defeat the enemy
[48:42] it would have been too brittle who how
[48:44] could this have how could this have
[48:46] withstood the enemy at that time but it
[48:49] wasn't the Jawbone of an ass so much as
[48:53] it was a Son of God a son of Abraham
[48:56] that was yielded to the Lord in that
[48:59] moment it we see Samson himself you know
[49:02] it's painted so clear to us uh through
[49:05] the the eyes of this hour through the
[49:08] messenger that he's Samson was not some
[49:10] great big muscular man that was all
[49:14] stretched out there God God didn't need
[49:17] Earthly muscle
[49:19] God still don't need Earthly muscle
[49:22] you don't not meaning our Earthly
[49:24] strength it fails it's look look here in
[49:28] the example what what an example that is
[49:30] a type here you see how that Moses his
[49:33] hand is up with the rod of God but
[49:36] notice as as time goes on his hands
[49:40] begin to go down it gets heavy and he
[49:43] needs others to to keep it up and it
[49:46] shows that man in himself in just his
[49:49] his human strength is not able to hold
[49:53] it up it takes one greater he who is the
[49:59] strength Giver himself
[50:01] see God allows this Victory to be
[50:03] displayed but then yet in the midst of
[50:05] this God also lets it be displayed that
[50:08] there has got to come a greater raising
[50:12] up of this Rod of God there's got to
[50:15] come a greater raising of it up and it's
[50:17] got to be one that not only could raise
[50:19] it up but one that could hold it up that
[50:22] that would be maintained
[50:25] what is it the Simplicity just like the
[50:28] Jawbone just like the Arts gold just
[50:30] like that of this rod and God makes
[50:32] known to hear to to to Moses he asked
[50:37] Moses what is that in thine hand and
[50:39] here what in the midst of that time when
[50:43] the rod is cast down upon the ground
[50:45] it's in it's in his hand but now he must
[50:48] take it in his hands so Moses hereby the
[50:50] word The Authority now that that Rod is
[50:53] cast down it becomes a serpent and as it
[50:56] goes up on the ground then God speaks to
[50:58] Moses again and says reach down with
[51:01] thine hand and take it up what is hand
[51:04] it's panned is power and authority
[51:07] so he's instructing him do this take it
[51:11] up with thine hand so when we we look at
[51:14] this of when we're seeing it of how that
[51:16] this rod in itself it was a rod that
[51:19] would go about and Moses no doubt it
[51:21] used to direct sheep for many time but
[51:24] yet it was going to become a rod of
[51:28] judgment in the hand of Moses and notice
[51:31] let me read how the prophet says it once
[51:33] again in this great servant Moses he
[51:36] said as Moses went with the Judgment
[51:38] stick before him that same stick tonight
[51:41] to the church is Jesus Christ
[51:46] so now he's he's bringing that type now
[51:49] showing that the same stick is Jesus
[51:51] Christ
[51:52] if those Egyptians could have ever got
[51:55] that little simple stick out of Moses
[51:59] hands they'd have had him whipped
[52:03] but they did not recognize that that was
[52:08] a that was a rod of judgment
[52:12] and it was something that to them it was
[52:14] simple see listen now what what would it
[52:17] what would have even caused it to wear
[52:19] if I can just speak just for a few
[52:21] moments freely remember what would it
[52:23] have been where they would have not said
[52:25] well let us have your stick instead it
[52:27] because they had they had those of
[52:30] magicians jammies and jambres that they
[52:32] could throw down their sticks and they
[52:34] became serpents it wasn't that Egypt
[52:37] listen to me now it wasn't that Egypt
[52:40] didn't have signs and wonders
[52:43] are you with me they had signs and
[52:46] wonders but what it is is that within
[52:48] Egypt those signs and wonders were not
[52:51] being given in a manner to bring Liberty
[52:55] those signs and wonders among the people
[52:58] only kept them in bondage
[53:01] because one wanted to do they looked
[53:03] simply at the signs and the Wonders and
[53:06] it kept them worshiping other deities
[53:09] other gods and if I can say it very
[53:12] clearly in this manner it keeps people
[53:14] with signs and wonders and other things
[53:16] and we believe let me just say this real
[53:18] clear We Believe signs and wonders
[53:20] follow the believer
[53:23] that's part of the Church of the Living
[53:25] God is that right that's part of the
[53:28] Bride of Jesus Christ because what he
[53:30] did in the groom he does in the bride
[53:32] he's the same yesterday and Forever The
[53:35] Works that I do shall you do also but
[53:38] those works are not just limited nor
[53:40] confined to just signs and wonders and
[53:43] miracles because remember that even
[53:46] through the manifestation of Miracles
[53:48] then there are those who can take back
[53:51] and instead of when the doctrine begins
[53:54] to go off they'll point the people in a
[53:56] manner and say at least we get results
[54:00] are you with me now you know I'm coming
[54:02] from what is it it's a power that's
[54:05] holding the people but yet when you see
[54:08] it that within God there is a people
[54:11] that are a part of that word that are
[54:14] ordained to come in Union with that word
[54:16] and they in themselves there's something
[54:18] that's lacking they see healing they see
[54:20] Miracles they see things but yet they
[54:22] recognize there is something that's
[54:25] missing
[54:27] because there's got to be something
[54:29] where there is a power that can come and
[54:32] bring an overcoming life
[54:35] I don't want just healing in my body
[54:37] it's got to be healing of the Soul
[54:40] amen there's got to be a power that
[54:43] packs full Deliverance
[54:45] amen something that doesn't keep in
[54:48] bondage but it delivers
[54:50] see that kind of power being manifested
[54:52] binds people to the vessel
[54:55] are you with me but the power of God
[54:58] when it's coming through the word it
[55:00] binds and unites people to Jesus Christ
[55:03] in a love affair
[55:06] that's Liberty
[55:13] a simple stick
[55:16] out of Moses hands they'd have had him
[55:18] whipped
[55:22] they couldn't talk Moses out of that
[55:24] they couldn't get it away from me
[55:28] let me say this to you
[55:29] to the real believers
[55:32] to the Church of the Living God there's
[55:34] not enough explanation that can take the
[55:36] Holy Ghost
[55:38] there's not enough that can take the
[55:40] deity of Jesus Christ from the life of a
[55:44] Believer I don't care what kind of
[55:45] reasoning comes and well they believe
[55:47] Jesus just as much and they believe but
[55:49] they can't get that little spit out of
[55:52] your hands that which has been laying
[55:55] here in the word but now hear what we
[55:58] see that same Mighty God Rising
[56:07] can't get it out
[56:10] we don't need any more we don't need any
[56:12] more move of God we don't need
[56:15] they can't get that simple stick out
[56:18] I'll tell you brother and sister we
[56:21] still need the moving of the Lord
[56:23] let me say this the preaching of the
[56:26] word of God the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[56:28] brings the Holy Spirit on the scene
[56:36] amen we we don't need a rehearsal of
[56:38] History we need that same God present to
[56:41] our young people and people coming into
[56:43] this church to where they when they come
[56:45] face to face and they recognize
[56:47] something is different
[56:49] they recognize that God is present they
[56:53] recognize that God who gave the word who
[56:56] wrote the word who made the promise is
[56:58] alive and real and wants to fulfill that
[57:01] promise
[57:03] that's necessary because history never
[57:06] produces power
[57:11] but the God who knows history
[57:13] is the god who makes himself known as
[57:16] the I am present
[57:18] amen and the I am takes care of History
[57:26] when the devil look at this when the
[57:28] devil could ever get
[57:29] the deity I'm saying it like you can
[57:31] read it
[57:33] I'm so used to that
[57:35] when the devil could ever get the deity
[57:37] out of the name of Jesus Christ he's got
[57:40] the church whipped
[57:43] get the deity out of the name not just
[57:45] having the name of Jesus Christ
[57:48] but he wants to take the power the deity
[57:51] the literal life out of the name
[57:57] notice he he says as the Judgment stick
[58:00] went before Moses to take the judgment
[58:02] to bring the Judgment so does the name
[58:04] of Jesus go before us to take our
[58:07] judgment it stands our Judgment of
[58:09] sickness stands our Judgment of death
[58:11] stands our Judgment of trouble he has
[58:14] already stood for us
[58:22] I watch watch I want you to look at this
[58:25] here
[58:26] as we were reading in in Exodus 17.
[58:30] God after
[58:33] this discomforting of amalek here
[58:37] the Lord God told Moses
[58:40] I don't want this to be forgotten
[58:44] I don't want it to be forgotten
[58:47] but God what amalek did
[58:51] and God said what I want you to do I
[58:53] want you to write it down into a
[58:55] memorial
[58:56] I want you to write this down and then
[58:59] after it's wrote I want you to rehearse
[59:03] it into the ears of Joshua
[59:05] so I don't just want it to be something
[59:08] that he just reads
[59:11] come on somebody
[59:12] but I want I
[59:14] would be rehearsed in his ears in other
[59:16] words what is written must be spoken
[59:22] and Joshua has one that's going to have
[59:25] ears to hear
[59:27] and not just going to be able to have
[59:28] the ears to hear that he can finish what
[59:31] has been wrote no no that's not what
[59:32] we're talking about we're not talking
[59:34] about stars on a chart in Sunday school
[59:36] we're talking about where then that when
[59:39] that is rehearsed in the ears of Joshua
[59:42] as something that rises within Joshua in
[59:46] every time that it remains to
[59:48] remembrance what amalek has done
[59:54] to do what deal with amalek
[59:58] glory be to God
[1:00:02] notice this in verse 14. know that God
[1:00:06] said rehearse it in the ears of Joshua
[1:00:08] so it's got to be told in the ears of
[1:00:10] Joshua but we got to look at a key part
[1:00:12] here for I will utterly put out the
[1:00:16] remembrance of amalek from under heaven
[1:00:19] you will
[1:00:21] God's letting him what is God doing he
[1:00:24] is committing himself to his word
[1:00:29] he's committing himself that he alone is
[1:00:32] the one that will deal with amulet and
[1:00:35] is he alone that'll put amalek out of
[1:00:38] remembrance
[1:00:40] God wants him remembered but yet he
[1:00:43] wants to put it out of remembrance oh
[1:00:47] he won't say he wants it to be
[1:00:48] remembered but then he said I'm going to
[1:00:50] put it out of remembrance
[1:00:53] y'all with me now right
[1:00:55] Hallelujah because in verse 16 because
[1:00:58] the Lord has sworn that the Lord will
[1:01:02] have war with amalek from generation to
[1:01:05] generation
[1:01:06] now God he he puts this he puts this
[1:01:09] down in Deuteronomy 25 even in 200
[1:01:12] Deuteronomy 25 17 and God would hear
[1:01:16] they're getting ready to come into the
[1:01:17] land here is is preliminary counsel
[1:01:19] that's being given and and there to be
[1:01:21] remembered of this right here and you
[1:01:23] know sometimes you look there's things
[1:01:25] that you and I don't want to remember
[1:01:27] is that right but there are things that
[1:01:30] we do need to remember
[1:01:33] come on somebody and God here he could
[1:01:36] have wrote this at the beginning of
[1:01:38] Deuteronomy 1 but instead now it comes
[1:01:41] toward the latter part of Deuteronomy
[1:01:43] and right in here he he asked in verse
[1:01:46] 17 remember what amalek did unto thee by
[1:01:49] the way when you were come forth out of
[1:01:51] Egypt Verse 18 how he met thee by the
[1:01:54] way look what he did and smoke behind
[1:01:56] most of thee even all that were feeble
[1:01:59] behind thee when thou was faint and
[1:02:01] weary and he feared not God
[1:02:05] let me say it like this here here is
[1:02:08] Israel they the the the rod of God has
[1:02:11] just been used to smote The Rock in the
[1:02:15] wilderness that they would have drink
[1:02:19] and here is amalek amalek is not going
[1:02:22] to attack the front
[1:02:25] he ain't gonna attack the Middle where
[1:02:27] amalek is coming amalek as a scripture
[1:02:30] identifies and God wants to remember
[1:02:32] that he attacked the weak
[1:02:36] he said I want it remembered all those
[1:02:38] that were feeble behind thee when thou
[1:02:40] was faint and weary oh Jesus then I
[1:02:44] preach now you might feel this morning I
[1:02:46] don't feel very strong but God is
[1:02:49] mindful of you
[1:02:51] you might feel weak but God is mindful
[1:02:54] of you
[1:02:55] he was not having them remember amulet
[1:02:58] because amalek attacked the strong he
[1:03:01] was saying remember amulet because
[1:03:03] amulet did not even fear me and he came
[1:03:06] against those that were weak
[1:03:09] those that were feeble
[1:03:11] you know what God was saying if you want
[1:03:13] to pick a battle with me and my people
[1:03:15] come to me
[1:03:16] [Applause]
[1:03:19] amen
[1:03:21] don't mean don't go around and check my
[1:03:23] children and come at them and attacking
[1:03:25] weakness but if you've got something
[1:03:27] come to me
[1:03:30] glory be to God oh Stay With Me Now Stay
[1:03:33] With Me Now
[1:03:34] glory be to God God help me to Pace
[1:03:36] myself
[1:03:38] when the Lord noticed God said after the
[1:03:41] Lord has given the Lord God had given
[1:03:43] you rest from your enemies in the land
[1:03:46] when you have received rest from your
[1:03:49] enemies in the land but I want you to
[1:03:51] rise up and I want you to remember
[1:03:52] amalek
[1:03:53] you get over in the land don't you get
[1:03:55] comfortable and forget about him
[1:03:58] cause I ain't forgetting about him
[1:04:04] [Music]
[1:04:06] let me tell you something when God has
[1:04:08] given a word and God releases his word
[1:04:11] his promise for that generation that
[1:04:14] word is not just something that's to be
[1:04:16] spoken in that generation and we somehow
[1:04:19] Rejoice around that and forget about it
[1:04:21] there is a purpose when God sends his
[1:04:24] word and when God visits a generation
[1:04:28] there is a purpose that is had within it
[1:04:32] amen there's a reason within it that
[1:04:34] word when it comes what is it it is the
[1:04:37] very word that has already been written
[1:04:39] and laid out by the prophet if we can
[1:04:42] say it in that manner and the same one
[1:04:44] who is the prophet and the prophesy what
[1:04:47] does he do he rehearses it in the ears
[1:04:50] of Joshua he rehearses it in the ears of
[1:04:54] his body
[1:04:55] what don't just become complacent that
[1:04:59] this message that God has sent us is not
[1:05:01] just another move
[1:05:06] remember
[1:05:07] Emily remember amulet remember Emily
[1:05:14] remember ambulance
[1:05:17] because I
[1:05:19] have remembered you
[1:05:23] you are my son of Promise born
[1:05:26] in this son than daughter that's after
[1:05:28] the flesh but you
[1:05:30] are mine and high
[1:05:32] I'm not going to forget
[1:05:34] my promise
[1:05:39] sin
[1:05:40] has got to be dealt with
[1:05:44] it can't be forgotten nor swept under
[1:05:48] the rug
[1:05:51] you see the scriptures are clear and I
[1:05:53] don't want to dwell on this point a lot
[1:05:54] this morning but the scriptures are
[1:05:56] clear that God visits the iniquity
[1:05:59] from generation to generation
[1:06:01] it increases
[1:06:03] it multiplies
[1:06:05] is that right
[1:06:07] we we see that that where when
[1:06:10] and even in the household of David I
[1:06:13] don't want to elaborate so much upon
[1:06:14] that this morning but you see how God
[1:06:16] will he addresses and he deals with that
[1:06:18] so sin itself has got to be dealt with
[1:06:21] you can't just you can't Overlook it you
[1:06:23] can't make excuses for it it can't be
[1:06:25] forgotten it's got to be dealt with
[1:06:29] it is that right and there's only one
[1:06:31] that can deal with it
[1:06:33] and that's him
[1:06:37] but he only can deal with it through
[1:06:40] willing vessels
[1:06:44] now think of this here came one amalek
[1:06:48] even to where that in numbers 24 when
[1:06:51] Balaam is moved by the spirit of God and
[1:06:54] Balaam here God begins to speak there
[1:06:57] through Balaam and he begins to speak
[1:07:00] about how that there is a star going to
[1:07:02] rise out of Jacob
[1:07:04] he begins to speak of this this which is
[1:07:07] coming this coming one you see God even
[1:07:09] made Balaam testify of it
[1:07:13] he borrowed balaam's lips
[1:07:16] I hope you're with me God can borrow and
[1:07:19] listen friends I'm not throwing
[1:07:20] everybody out as bailing but what I'm
[1:07:22] telling you is God can take things can
[1:07:25] take words and can take those things
[1:07:27] that are inspiration that has dropped
[1:07:29] even in songs and other things but yet
[1:07:32] there is such a significance and a depth
[1:07:35] of meaning among the children of
[1:07:37] almighty God the elect of God it has
[1:07:40] such a meaning
[1:07:43] My God is Awesome
[1:07:45] but I don't sing my God is awesome
[1:07:47] because when I come to church will I get
[1:07:49] all cleaned up again and when I go back
[1:07:51] out I live filthy and then I come back
[1:07:53] into church and I get all cleaned up
[1:07:54] again I'm not saying that that's the way
[1:07:56] that the guy who wrote it that went
[1:07:57] about that but I'm telling you my God is
[1:08:00] awesome because there is a power that is
[1:08:03] able to save to the uttermost it's able
[1:08:06] to bring a cleansing down on the inside
[1:08:08] and you're aware that Christ himself
[1:08:11] becomes merged and Blended in and United
[1:08:13] in the life of the believer and it is
[1:08:16] God then working himself and his will
[1:08:19] through your life
[1:08:20] that's awesome
[1:08:25] um
[1:08:28] so here
[1:08:30] the prophet as he takes us in the
[1:08:32] seventh seal
[1:08:34] he says
[1:08:37] it's an old battle
[1:08:39] that started way back Beyond Time
[1:08:42] and and and Satan and his angels was
[1:08:44] kicked out
[1:08:45] and then they come to earth and the
[1:08:47] battle set in again
[1:08:51] what is this
[1:08:53] remembering what amalek has done
[1:08:57] Hallelujah
[1:08:59] because he broke down
[1:09:02] from where she was isolated behind the
[1:09:04] word of God and from that very hour
[1:09:05] Satan won the battle over God's word
[1:09:07] because one of his subjects the weaker
[1:09:10] let down the bar
[1:09:13] what is this amaleks attack
[1:09:16] the weak and the feeble
[1:09:19] you're with me now so here remember
[1:09:23] Satan never came to Adam
[1:09:27] first time first Timothy 2 Adam was not
[1:09:31] deceived
[1:09:33] because why Adam was the word
[1:09:37] you can't deceive the word
[1:09:41] glory be to God is that right so he came
[1:09:45] to the church who came to the woman
[1:09:48] that which had been taken out of him but
[1:09:51] yet her womb had not been sealed yet
[1:09:55] and he begins to come to the weaker
[1:09:58] that's what the scripture says in the
[1:10:00] book of Peter it lets us know give honor
[1:10:02] unto her as unto the weaker vessel
[1:10:05] is that right so here God is pointing
[1:10:09] this out he even points that God's care
[1:10:11] look Ephesians 5 husband and wife God is
[1:10:14] pointing out the care that the husband
[1:10:16] the strong one you ought to be the
[1:10:18] strong one let me just stop for a moment
[1:10:20] you ought to be the strong one I'm not
[1:10:22] talking about everything's my way and we
[1:10:25] do it this we bless God God's given me
[1:10:27] to be the head of the house and God's
[1:10:28] called you to be a bully too
[1:10:31] a dictator
[1:10:33] come on somebody her brother Sammy you
[1:10:35] are preaching so well no I'm dealing
[1:10:37] with amulet
[1:10:38] I'm dealing with family
[1:10:40] yes sir
[1:10:43] because you see Christ himself who is
[1:10:45] the strong one the mighty one notice how
[1:10:48] Paul would direct how the strong one is
[1:10:51] to care for the weaker one
[1:10:54] you and I did not have what was needed
[1:10:57] to be able to overcome but the strong
[1:10:59] one prevailed
[1:11:03] and he prevailed and overcome he gave to
[1:11:07] us the spoil of the victory
[1:11:10] Glory
[1:11:12] notice Eve broke down that barrier and
[1:11:15] that's exactly how he won the battle
[1:11:17] every time by what reasoning
[1:11:20] reasoning
[1:11:21] reasoning he gets in the reason gets to
[1:11:25] imagination well you know God's a good
[1:11:27] God and God understands and God this and
[1:11:29] got that
[1:11:32] it's amazing you know that when I go to
[1:11:34] the bookstore I don't see your name on a
[1:11:36] new Bible version
[1:11:40] maybe you've got your own you know app
[1:11:42] and you've got your own table version
[1:11:43] now
[1:11:45] come on Friends
[1:11:46] people have their certain quotes and
[1:11:48] they have their certain things that they
[1:11:49] like let me tell you we ought to be able
[1:11:51] to take off the word of God
[1:11:53] let me tell you this is exactly how the
[1:11:56] spirit of God spoke in this hour
[1:11:58] in the Easter seal had the spirit of God
[1:12:01] standing there in the prophet he said he
[1:12:03] that cannot take the full word of God is
[1:12:06] a sinner
[1:12:09] they called Jesus and said you'll be
[1:12:11] else about and Jesus said if you cannot
[1:12:14] believe me believe the works
[1:12:17] they testify me and the prophet comes
[1:12:19] around again at the end of the message
[1:12:21] and he says he that cannot believe and
[1:12:23] to take and accept that fluid of God is
[1:12:26] a sinner
[1:12:28] let me tell you something receiving the
[1:12:31] full word of God does not end with the
[1:12:32] prophet
[1:12:35] the full word of God must be born into
[1:12:37] existence in the lives of his people
[1:12:42] are you with me
[1:12:46] oh
[1:12:48] you're saying we recognize that just
[1:12:50] recognizing God sent a prophet doesn't
[1:12:51] deal with Emily
[1:12:54] you're with me you can find things that
[1:12:56] that that can be shown out to cover up
[1:12:59] amalek
[1:13:00] not the spirit of God doing that
[1:13:03] come on somebody
[1:13:05] we're talking about a depth that's here
[1:13:09] A Life That's to be produced
[1:13:12] not just the half the blood but you must
[1:13:14] apply the blood and when you apply the
[1:13:16] blood then the life will come
[1:13:19] how do I apply the block believe what
[1:13:22] the word which is the blood of Jesus
[1:13:24] Christ is issuing for it believe that
[1:13:27] word and surrender to it and the spirit
[1:13:29] of God will come right behind it
[1:13:36] because one of his subjects let down the
[1:13:38] bar from the word
[1:13:40] but much we could speak even within that
[1:13:44] you know friends were all we were faced
[1:13:45] we're faced each and every day in every
[1:13:48] part in our life
[1:13:50] the whole thing of in the enemy's
[1:13:52] advancement in approach
[1:13:54] he doesn't he won't come to you
[1:13:56] necessarily when you're in your strong
[1:13:58] times
[1:14:00] you understand I'm not talking about
[1:14:01] your soul now I'm talking about times
[1:14:03] when you feel strong man
[1:14:06] but he'll come in those times to try to
[1:14:09] make advancement
[1:14:11] on you
[1:14:13] I'm not talking about dragging you out
[1:14:15] in sin oh brother the same I I couldn't
[1:14:16] help but he drugged me back out to the
[1:14:18] BART no you weren't sealed in
[1:14:20] no no you weren't sealed in
[1:14:22] that's just the truth because to make it
[1:14:24] any other way we've got a powerless
[1:14:26] gospel we've got a powerless atonement
[1:14:29] we got a power this Holy Ghost
[1:14:32] you're going to say man or not because
[1:14:34] this word did not come with that power
[1:14:38] amen he said you're to be you're to
[1:14:41] receive that Holy Ghost and be Witnesses
[1:14:46] of me unto the uttermost parts
[1:14:55] the prophet himself
[1:14:57] he said he talked about here he is he's
[1:14:59] standing in the message of perfect Faith
[1:15:00] he also brings it up in uniting time and
[1:15:02] sign
[1:15:03] he stands in perfect Faith he says you
[1:15:05] think I don't get gloomy spells too
[1:15:08] you think I don't get moody
[1:15:11] I'm talking about the prophet of God
[1:15:14] I'm talking about the flesh
[1:15:16] he that was born after Charles and Ella
[1:15:18] Branham
[1:15:19] I'm not talking about the Son of God
[1:15:21] brother Branham
[1:15:24] are you with me
[1:15:25] just like you getting Moody
[1:15:31] watch and he says that's when Satan
[1:15:34] comes at me when I get myself all
[1:15:37] overworked and I get weak
[1:15:42] it comes at him with thoughts nobody
[1:15:45] cares about you
[1:15:48] and what did the prophet say
[1:15:50] he looks back
[1:15:52] and he looks over the congregation
[1:15:53] here's people that stayed around for a
[1:15:55] second service
[1:15:58] well
[1:15:59] I'm not preaching a whole enough
[1:16:00] Joshua's holding up Moses hands today we
[1:16:03] still got some time on that thing God
[1:16:04] just put some things on back but here he
[1:16:07] is he looks around and he sees people
[1:16:09] that drove at such a distance
[1:16:13] and here they are standing people who
[1:16:15] are standing faithful what does it do it
[1:16:17] encourages him and he said I'll turn
[1:16:20] right back around and tell Satan look at
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:24] look at that you need to just pick up
[1:16:27] your phone once a while and say look at
[1:16:28] that text Buddy
[1:16:30] let me read it to you I saved it in a
[1:16:33] file
[1:16:35] so Samuel you're crazy maybe I am but I
[1:16:39] have files that I have saved words of
[1:16:40] encouragement cards that have been given
[1:16:43] over the year and you know what I'll get
[1:16:45] them out and read over many many times
[1:16:47] oh brother Samuel that that's carnal is
[1:16:50] it when the prophet said he would get
[1:16:51] down he said he would go into his den
[1:16:54] room and he would look around at each
[1:16:56] one of those trophies and he would
[1:16:58] remember the hunt
[1:17:01] well the prophet could not only remember
[1:17:04] that in remembering the hunt but when I
[1:17:06] could begin to look back on that it's a
[1:17:07] reminder to me I believe that God is
[1:17:09] moving whether I see it or not but when
[1:17:13] I can read that in the testimony of the
[1:17:15] lives that is the objective that burns
[1:17:18] within my heart is that the gospel has
[1:17:21] first place and preeminence in the
[1:17:23] hearts of the people and is producing in
[1:17:26] them that same victory
[1:17:29] that's worth rejoicing
[1:17:39] here God remembers my Lord I don't know
[1:17:42] where time goes
[1:17:44] [Laughter]
[1:17:46] my God
[1:17:48] he lays it out
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:52] when the when the situation has come God
[1:17:56] remember he goes down through in
[1:17:57] dressing he comes to the man the man
[1:17:59] passes to the woman and the woman said
[1:18:01] well the serpent beguiled me and and
[1:18:03] then God comes and he lets it be known
[1:18:06] in Genesis 3 15 that that I'm going to
[1:18:08] put enmity between thee and the woman
[1:18:11] and between thy seed and her seed
[1:18:14] see God God knew that there had to be
[1:18:18] and there is only one remedy to deal
[1:18:21] with amalek
[1:18:26] God even would have it rewrote by Moses
[1:18:30] and referred to a country of amaleks in
[1:18:33] Genesis 14 before amalek was ever born
[1:18:37] you with me he won the amalekites but it
[1:18:40] was called the country of amalekites why
[1:18:43] God already prophetically knew that
[1:18:46] expense that the amalekites that they
[1:18:48] would reside in but God also knew that I
[1:18:51] that is the country that belongeth to my
[1:18:54] seed and to my children and they shall
[1:18:57] be dispelled
[1:19:00] glory be to God
[1:19:02] now watch this
[1:19:05] there's no lasting Victory like here's
[1:19:07] Moses his hands up
[1:19:09] it will go down
[1:19:10] human strength what's that like it's
[1:19:12] like the law
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:15] holding up real good then it gets heavy
[1:19:18] why because there's not human strength
[1:19:20] can't do it
[1:19:22] you see friends human strength might
[1:19:24] keep it up Taryn and might keep it up
[1:19:26] there for years and all of a sudden it
[1:19:28] goes down
[1:19:29] it can't be human strength that that's
[1:19:32] not what serving God is all about
[1:19:35] serving God is where he becomes the
[1:19:39] indwelling within our life and then we
[1:19:42] are his servants by sonship or daughters
[1:19:47] in his economy by the new birth
[1:19:53] there's no lasting victory
[1:19:55] within this measure watch this how the
[1:19:58] prophet will remember how the brother
[1:20:00] Brown will tell us over and over he says
[1:20:03] when God told Joshua and them to come
[1:20:05] into the land he told them you destroy
[1:20:08] all the inhabitants is that right Donnie
[1:20:11] said don't you even leave a baby
[1:20:16] now come on now let's not get all hung
[1:20:18] up like the secular world
[1:20:20] destroying the babies God's letting
[1:20:22] something be shown here if you let a
[1:20:24] little malachite grow he'll grow to be a
[1:20:27] big amalekites
[1:20:30] come on somebody time don't change
[1:20:34] nothing
[1:20:37] don't change
[1:20:40] but there must be one step into time
[1:20:44] and when one steps into time one from
[1:20:47] eternity he's the one that can bring a
[1:20:49] change in time that lasts for eternity
[1:20:54] Hallelujah so get rid of those little
[1:20:58] amalekites
[1:21:02] we could name him but we'll wait
[1:21:08] in Exodus 17 which we read let me just
[1:21:12] show you this in Exodus 17 Moses
[1:21:16] they were discomforted that day by the
[1:21:18] edge of the sword
[1:21:20] they were not completely eradicated
[1:21:24] because God said remember it
[1:21:27] write about it and rehearse it in the
[1:21:29] years of Joshua
[1:21:31] when it came time to go over into the
[1:21:33] land
[1:21:35] the children of Israel rebelled against
[1:21:37] the word of the Lord
[1:21:40] the report was brought back the land is
[1:21:42] as God said it would be
[1:21:48] but
[1:21:50] but Joshua but Moses
[1:21:52] you you said
[1:21:55] that God met you there at the burning
[1:21:57] bush and and you said that that God said
[1:22:01] that he would bring us into a land that
[1:22:02] flows with milk and honey and you would
[1:22:05] that we would drive up
[1:22:08] yes that's what God Said
[1:22:13] but their focus they started focusing on
[1:22:16] things as though
[1:22:18] God evidently missed this God didn't see
[1:22:20] this
[1:22:21] no what what it is is that as you move
[1:22:24] in the promise
[1:22:26] his strength moves through you
[1:22:30] he gives you strength listen now let's
[1:22:33] just make it very simple when God deals
[1:22:35] with your heart through the preaching of
[1:22:36] the word he brings conviction to a heart
[1:22:38] and a person is drawn to repent of their
[1:22:41] sins and receive Jesus Christ as their
[1:22:44] savior is that right that's the strength
[1:22:46] of God coming to meet you in your
[1:22:48] weakness you rise in that strength and
[1:22:51] repent is that right then that strength
[1:22:54] it preached put you in a place to where
[1:22:56] that now the word can begin to move in
[1:22:59] your life and the blood coming and being
[1:23:01] applied it brings a sanctification
[1:23:04] right what is that Grace providing
[1:23:07] strength for you to come to what God is
[1:23:10] calling you to
[1:23:11] then that same strength it moves you
[1:23:14] along into a further work of God's grace
[1:23:17] and strength to wear now that he births
[1:23:20] within you his own life
[1:23:25] and you become merged with him in a
[1:23:29] union
[1:23:30] and then as you're in that union he
[1:23:34] gives you strength day by day by day
[1:23:39] what is it it's him in you increasing in
[1:23:44] you
[1:23:47] what Israel failed to do under Joshua in
[1:23:52] taking the entire land the Holy Ghost In
[1:23:55] You Christ in you is taking the whole
[1:23:59] land
[1:24:04] the land was a choice spot
[1:24:07] is that right the land was a designated
[1:24:11] spot that the Messiah would come and
[1:24:13] reveal himself in that land that's why
[1:24:16] Israel had to come out of of Egypt and
[1:24:19] come into the land because in the land
[1:24:21] then the promise of the Messiah would
[1:24:24] come to pass
[1:24:26] so the whole journey was about the
[1:24:29] Messiah coming to pass and the Messiah
[1:24:31] would be God himself stepping down into
[1:24:35] a body form
[1:24:38] it was a designated land
[1:24:42] and through that designated land notice
[1:24:45] here there was a need because when God
[1:24:49] himself coming here Among Us God is not
[1:24:52] going to forget about his Covenant and
[1:24:55] so God remembering his Covenant watch
[1:24:57] God remembering this Covenant that he
[1:24:59] pulled write it down God remembers it by
[1:25:02] himself coming according to his word
[1:25:05] he comes job said man born of a woman is
[1:25:08] a few days old full of trouble right so
[1:25:11] here God remembering what that he is the
[1:25:15] one who will utterly put out of
[1:25:17] remembrance amulet that he alone will do
[1:25:19] this he is remembering his Covenant for
[1:25:23] he comes through and by and the Flesh
[1:25:27] and Blood coming he recreates a blood
[1:25:30] cell that he might come a body that he
[1:25:33] might come and dwell in what's he doing
[1:25:35] remembering
[1:25:37] when God became one of us he's
[1:25:39] remembering his Covenant
[1:25:43] is a memorial that's being rehearsed
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:48] the Bible says rehearse this in the ears
[1:25:51] of Joshua is that right here when when
[1:25:54] Simeon the Bible says that Simeon a man
[1:25:58] full of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:00] that's the first thing
[1:26:02] full of the Holy Ghost it was revealed
[1:26:04] to him
[1:26:06] why the holy ghost that he should see he
[1:26:09] should not see death until he seen the
[1:26:11] Lord's Christ what was he doing he wants
[1:26:14] to see the culmination of the promise of
[1:26:17] the Messiah that was coming that that
[1:26:19] word was to come again and be
[1:26:21] materialized and come completely in
[1:26:23] human flesh
[1:26:25] what is it son of man
[1:26:27] are you with me Christ's coming down and
[1:26:30] stepping right in the midst it's God
[1:26:31] revealing himself is it no Marvel this
[1:26:34] is not coincidence in this hour how many
[1:26:37] times the prophet in the earlier part of
[1:26:38] the ministry and continued to pick it up
[1:26:40] how Simeon was led by the spirit of God
[1:26:42] he's not just talking about somebody
[1:26:43] being led by the spirit he's speaking of
[1:26:45] the hour
[1:26:47] where Christ himself is becoming
[1:26:50] personally identified not just through
[1:26:52] the prophet's life but in a
[1:26:54] many-membered body
[1:26:56] hey man that's a rapture
[1:26:59] that brings a rapture
[1:27:02] right
[1:27:04] so in looking at this God when he come
[1:27:07] remember the Scriptures it lays Out For
[1:27:10] unto us a child is born
[1:27:12] is that right unto us a child is born
[1:27:15] and and and and the uh unto us the son
[1:27:18] is given the government shall be upon
[1:27:20] his shoulder his strength see the
[1:27:22] strength
[1:27:23] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:27:25] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[1:27:26] father the Prince of Peace of the
[1:27:28] increase of his government and peace
[1:27:30] there shall be no end
[1:27:34] there was a need
[1:27:36] for a redeemer
[1:27:39] see look at this how did all of this
[1:27:42] works with Israel
[1:27:44] Israel refuses to go into the land
[1:27:48] the amalekites come down
[1:27:50] and discomfort Israel
[1:27:53] what was it Israel letting down the bar
[1:27:55] Israel was letting down the bar
[1:27:58] how are they letting down the bar by
[1:28:00] doubting
[1:28:01] God
[1:28:03] they doubted that God was able to
[1:28:05] perform what he said
[1:28:06] and because of that it caused him to let
[1:28:09] down the bar
[1:28:10] is that right here's the word when God
[1:28:13] has given a word you'll be tested on
[1:28:15] that word
[1:28:16] you're tested on that word when God is
[1:28:19] given his word to your life into your
[1:28:21] heart you're going to be tested on that
[1:28:23] he's going to come at you every time
[1:28:25] there's an event listen friends with
[1:28:27] what God desires to do in your life
[1:28:29] don't think the devil ain't going to
[1:28:31] bring up every failure and everything
[1:28:33] else don't think he's not going to try
[1:28:34] to do that but you have got to remember
[1:28:37] there is a covenant in place there is a
[1:28:41] blood that packs within it Saint to find
[1:28:44] power there is a life that is present
[1:28:46] that brings total and complete
[1:28:49] deliverance
[1:28:50] there is blood on The Mercy Seat
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:55] you've got to remember those things that
[1:28:58] pertain to you
[1:29:04] amalekites came down
[1:29:07] here they are these guys are still
[1:29:09] hanging around
[1:29:10] in the Book of Judges in Gideon's time
[1:29:12] malachites
[1:29:16] these guys keep showing up like
[1:29:17] springtime ends
[1:29:22] first Samuel 15. Here Comes Here Comes
[1:29:25] the word of the Lord by Samuel to Saul
[1:29:27] so I'll go down there and kill again
[1:29:29] uh he just said kill all of them
[1:29:32] this was God's word
[1:29:34] but you see Saul shows the weakness of
[1:29:37] man
[1:29:38] the weakness of man
[1:29:40] Saul spares him
[1:29:43] he spares also choice sheep and other
[1:29:47] things too
[1:29:53] he's got an excuse for it
[1:29:55] you with me Saul's got an excuse
[1:30:03] we'll let that marinate over a few weeks
[1:30:08] here you find David in first Samuel 27
[1:30:10] when David is down there when he had run
[1:30:13] from Saul and he's there in the land of
[1:30:16] Philistines when they gave him the
[1:30:17] country of ziglak here he goes and he uh
[1:30:22] invades all of these uh the gurusites
[1:30:26] the garasytes and the malachites you
[1:30:28] find then in first Samuel 30.
[1:30:30] here the amalekites come down and take
[1:30:33] David's wife
[1:30:37] when they're away in battle
[1:30:40] is that right
[1:30:42] so what I'm just trying to show without
[1:30:44] elaborating on all those things is you
[1:30:46] see that there was no lasting victory
[1:30:50] they're not able to get rid of these
[1:30:52] things they keep coming back
[1:30:54] I hope somebody hear me this morning
[1:30:57] there's only one thing that can get rid
[1:30:59] of the amalekites
[1:31:02] and that's the Lord himself
[1:31:05] I will utterly put out of remembrance
[1:31:10] there's only one thing that can release
[1:31:12] within the individual prevailing power
[1:31:15] and that is Christ himself in you
[1:31:24] glory be to God
[1:31:26] everybody all right
[1:31:27] we're just getting started
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:33] just read I'm So Glad You Came Back
[1:31:36] [Laughter]
[1:31:39] God bless you
[1:31:41] we really are I'm not just teasing we
[1:31:43] really are we love you sister
[1:31:45] that's how God the virgin
[1:31:49] how that God
[1:31:51] makes us known that God he's got he
[1:31:54] creates himself he's going to give
[1:31:55] himself a son back
[1:31:57] so he can't take something that's
[1:31:59] already of this creation of this race
[1:32:01] but God creates himself a blood cell he
[1:32:04] creates himself a body that he himself
[1:32:07] alone apart from the woman apart from a
[1:32:10] sex act that he himself has created and
[1:32:14] that's a virgin birth because why
[1:32:16] because then by that he can come and he
[1:32:19] can claim that part of the Earth
[1:32:24] you see he wasn't trying to claim all
[1:32:26] the Earth right then he was just trying
[1:32:28] to get that part of the earth he had
[1:32:30] created that Palestine part
[1:32:33] because if he can get that Palestine but
[1:32:35] he redeems and brings to himself that
[1:32:38] son that he has created through that son
[1:32:40] he can redeem the rest of the Earth
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:45] what's he doing he's dealing with amalek
[1:32:50] oh my as he's baptizing here comes down
[1:32:53] out of the heaven the heavens are open
[1:32:56] here and see the Holy Ghost descending
[1:32:58] in the form of a doubt it latched down
[1:33:00] upon that Temple it comes to claim what
[1:33:02] it alone has created and brought forth
[1:33:04] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:33:06] pleased to dwell in what is it it's God
[1:33:09] who was overshadowing and bringing forth
[1:33:12] the body it was in the womb there it was
[1:33:15] a word that was their prophecy that was
[1:33:17] there throughout that time and now
[1:33:19] notice how the word was moving and the
[1:33:21] word had come into a place of where now
[1:33:24] it was in the womb but that word itself
[1:33:26] it had to be born out of that womb of a
[1:33:28] church and that word had to stand here
[1:33:31] and the spirit of God standing right
[1:33:33] there in the midst of that word in its
[1:33:36] fullness
[1:33:38] you with me that is why the Rapture
[1:33:42] itself could not come to the lady of
[1:33:45] seeing age per se
[1:33:48] The Headstone could not set down on that
[1:33:51] lady of sin age brotherly kindness but
[1:33:54] it must be the coming of The Headstone
[1:33:57] that draws up those who are identified
[1:34:00] in his life all the way down through and
[1:34:04] it brings you and I into a place of the
[1:34:07] Holy Spirit right there where it is
[1:34:09] Christ himself now remember he releasing
[1:34:12] his life not just a baptism of the Holy
[1:34:15] Ghost but the person of Christ himself
[1:34:18] now dwelling in his fullness in a bright
[1:34:22] body
[1:34:25] where he is having the preeminence
[1:34:29] you know how the prophet says in Spoke
[1:34:32] original words words original C
[1:34:34] what's he doing in that message he is
[1:34:36] dealing with remembering remember
[1:34:39] remember and he began what the spirit of
[1:34:42] God doing the spirit of God is showing
[1:34:43] all the way down through time where the
[1:34:45] failure has taken place
[1:34:47] in the seals what do
[1:34:52] what has been
[1:34:54] as he himself is being revealed
[1:34:57] and it reveals what shall be who is it
[1:35:00] Christ he which once which is and which
[1:35:02] shall come what's he doing he's
[1:35:05] revealing that Cassie that sin can be
[1:35:08] swept under the rock or forgotten about
[1:35:10] Sin must be repented of
[1:35:14] it that's the end of the age it says I
[1:35:16] would that word hot or cold bezelius
[1:35:19] therefore and repent
[1:35:22] if it repentance is called then it shows
[1:35:25] a supreme sacrifice he has stepped
[1:35:27] forward as the amen of God in
[1:35:29] Revelations 3. I hope you're with me I
[1:35:31] don't have time to read I'm just going
[1:35:33] to quote you're going to pick it up now
[1:35:35] as it's coming and he stands as the amen
[1:35:38] of God in this age and he is calling the
[1:35:41] age to repentance every age has been
[1:35:44] called to repent us because there has
[1:35:46] been elect children down through every
[1:35:48] age and it is God himself that has made
[1:35:52] it known he's dealing with amulet and
[1:35:55] it's not something new that he's doing
[1:35:57] but he's pointing us back to the
[1:35:59] finished work of calvary
[1:36:03] Romans 8 3 that the law itself was weak
[1:36:07] in the flesh
[1:36:09] but God himself came in the likeness of
[1:36:13] sinful flesh and condemned sin in the
[1:36:17] flesh that we might receive the spirit
[1:36:20] of Life the spirit of righteousness the
[1:36:23] righteousness fulfilled of the law in
[1:36:26] our lives
[1:36:27] what righteousness or righteousness that
[1:36:30] is not something says I could do this
[1:36:33] but I better not do it I wouldn't do
[1:36:35] this but they said I can't do it that's
[1:36:37] not righteousness of God that's
[1:36:39] self-made righteousness but the
[1:36:41] righteousness of God which is there
[1:36:43] given by the spirit of righteousness and
[1:36:46] Holiness himself is the same Lord Jesus
[1:36:49] the righteous one himself living in the
[1:36:52] midst of his children whereby your
[1:36:54] cleansed you are Sanctified and filled
[1:36:57] with his spirit and you no longer want
[1:36:59] the things of the world
[1:37:02] the world is dead
[1:37:05] what is that that's dealing with Hamlet
[1:37:10] that's why the rod of God is not laid in
[1:37:13] a museum
[1:37:16] I don't want you to be a museum
[1:37:18] he don't want you to be a stone Idol
[1:37:22] he don't want you to be a wooden image
[1:37:26] the Bible said that they that speak unto
[1:37:28] them are lacking unto him
[1:37:30] why because the image can't hear you
[1:37:33] can't hear either
[1:37:36] but the image of Jesus Christ speaks and
[1:37:39] his children are able to hear his voice
[1:37:42] they hear the words
[1:37:44] of the wild underwear that has been
[1:37:46] given down Through the Ages God has made
[1:37:49] real in this hour through his Prophet
[1:37:51] that this is the time this is the
[1:37:54] culmination lay aside every sin and
[1:37:57] every weight that does so easily be set
[1:37:59] us and let us run this race of patience
[1:38:01] looking unto Jesus
[1:38:04] who's the author and the finish of our
[1:38:06] faith it's a doing calling
[1:38:08] to remembrance
[1:38:12] Prophet stepping forth in this age think
[1:38:14] of it he steps forth in this age he says
[1:38:17] what is this
[1:38:18] where people where's rugged Christianity
[1:38:22] where is it he said people become so
[1:38:23] entangled with entertainment
[1:38:26] they'd rather he said they'd rather stay
[1:38:28] home and I Love Lucy and I have other
[1:38:29] things
[1:38:31] that's a problem friends when people
[1:38:33] don't want to come to the house of God
[1:38:34] you got a love problem
[1:38:37] oh brother Samuel I know I know you can
[1:38:40] use that quote going to church don't
[1:38:41] save you but there's more quotes that go
[1:38:43] with it as well
[1:38:44] it ain't a building that saves you ain't
[1:38:46] in a building that bled for you but it's
[1:38:48] a preaching of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:38:50] Christ that not only saved your soul but
[1:38:53] it keeps you clean keeps you
[1:38:54] straightened up keeps you lined up you
[1:38:57] know why because it doesn't speak to
[1:38:59] lamalek it addresses the real son and
[1:39:01] daughter on the inside that that son and
[1:39:04] daughter of God raises up and says aha
[1:39:07] amalek trying to advance in weakness I
[1:39:11] got you you're trying to scramble upon
[1:39:14] feebleness
[1:39:15] what does he do he manifests himself as
[1:39:17] your strength
[1:39:21] glory be to God he remembers his
[1:39:24] Covenant when he became one of us he
[1:39:28] remembered his Covenant by becoming and
[1:39:31] and making a body and then through that
[1:39:34] body through the offering of that body
[1:39:36] up for you and I and then the sending
[1:39:38] back of the Holy Spirit it is God
[1:39:41] himself showing the whole Plan of
[1:39:43] Redemption is God showing I have
[1:39:45] remembered I have remembered and listen
[1:39:48] it was not something that God just
[1:39:49] learned but remember just as God could
[1:39:52] lay out and know what the country and
[1:39:54] called the country in Genesis 14 8 the
[1:39:57] country of the amalekites it's the same
[1:39:59] Lord God that knew had knowledge of that
[1:40:02] there would be a need of a lamb so God
[1:40:04] himself in his mind before the
[1:40:07] foundation of the world he laid for
[1:40:09] himself he becoming the atonement for
[1:40:12] his own children how could he become the
[1:40:14] atonement for you and I he can only
[1:40:16] become the atonement by he himself
[1:40:19] becoming one of us and the lamb was
[1:40:24] slain before the foundation the world
[1:40:27] God was already mindful
[1:40:31] think of it that in the work and in the
[1:40:34] midst of this hour
[1:40:36] here you find that notice
[1:40:39] after what was done
[1:40:42] in the book of Exodus 17 now let me just
[1:40:45] try to bring bring it down here
[1:40:48] you find that how that they lifted up
[1:40:50] that Banner
[1:40:52] the rod of God and there an altar is
[1:40:54] built they begin to worship
[1:40:56] worship around that Victory worship
[1:40:58] around that strength but then
[1:41:01] we've seen how that that Victory itself
[1:41:03] does not continue to last Every
[1:41:06] Generation and each time it's got to be
[1:41:07] Revisited it's the same thing now even
[1:41:10] though that there the answer has come
[1:41:12] for it every generation must receive
[1:41:14] that same true experience every young
[1:41:18] person no matter born of of holy
[1:41:20] ghost-filled parents are not must
[1:41:22] receive that same experience to know
[1:41:25] about the message to know that it's
[1:41:26] truth is not the experience but to have
[1:41:28] that word that life living in you to
[1:41:31] where he is everything to you
[1:41:35] I'll tell you right now that's the love
[1:41:36] of God dwelling in your heart
[1:41:39] but you see without that in your life
[1:41:40] you look at it as though it's human
[1:41:42] strength you can go and approach things
[1:41:44] for a long time you say well brother
[1:41:45] Samuel shouldn't I go ahead and continue
[1:41:47] in the word you should continue in the
[1:41:49] word if you realize that you're lacking
[1:41:51] within that you should but remember
[1:41:54] continuing in that word is looking for
[1:41:57] God to come and fulfill that word and
[1:41:59] say Lord you made this promise Lord and
[1:42:01] I am prostrating myself before you you
[1:42:04] who gave the word it doesn't matter how
[1:42:06] big their malachites are it doesn't
[1:42:08] matter how big the sons of Annika are it
[1:42:11] all that matters is you made the promise
[1:42:13] and I believe that I am a part of that
[1:42:15] promise I was ordained in this age for
[1:42:18] that promise to take a hold of my life
[1:42:20] and for that promise to reflect itself
[1:42:22] through me
[1:42:27] you believe that let me tell you
[1:42:29] something Prophet can't do it for you
[1:42:30] Pastor can't do it for you Church can't
[1:42:32] do it for you let me go and say it like
[1:42:34] this Jesus Christ himself standing here
[1:42:35] and flesh can't do it for you either You
[1:42:38] Must Believe
[1:42:40] you've got to believe it is for you
[1:42:43] you've got to believe that this promise
[1:42:46] is mine
[1:42:49] there'll be all kinds of opposition
[1:42:51] that's true but don't look at the
[1:42:53] opposition look at God who made the
[1:42:55] promise it isn't a position that's going
[1:42:58] to give you the promise it is God who
[1:43:00] made the promise he glorifies himself in
[1:43:03] you as you receive the promise and the
[1:43:06] promise becomes light in you it is God
[1:43:08] glorify himself in his word in you that
[1:43:13] he is greater than all opposition
[1:43:22] you love him
[1:43:27] the Virgin birth produced the necessary
[1:43:29] product
[1:43:30] right I love how the prophet says in the
[1:43:33] message breached he said here we were we
[1:43:35] were all out on a limb he said I've got
[1:43:37] you out on a limb right now we needed a
[1:43:39] redeemer he said but let me sound the
[1:43:40] trumpet to you the Virgin birth produced
[1:43:44] the product notice sound a trumpet what
[1:43:47] does a trumpet do it's letting you know
[1:43:49] you no longer have to remain a Slave
[1:43:55] it is a sound
[1:44:02] Ransom has come
[1:44:05] not just the shedding of his blood but
[1:44:08] this is the time and the Fulfillment of
[1:44:10] the word just as the time of Jubilee
[1:44:13] everything must coincide he himself who
[1:44:16] is the Jubilee his own life it has
[1:44:18] sounded out because he himself has given
[1:44:21] him his life as the very Ransom
[1:44:26] and that life
[1:44:28] speaks
[1:44:30] the blood
[1:44:33] the blood of Abel the law said you're
[1:44:35] guilty
[1:44:36] right the blood of Abel it it condemned
[1:44:40] Cain
[1:44:40] but the blood of Jesus
[1:44:43] you all right with this
[1:44:45] the blood of Jesus the prophet tells us
[1:44:47] in the message token I love how he says
[1:44:48] it he said but the blood of Jesus can
[1:44:50] take care of Cain
[1:44:54] notice how he's applying this and
[1:44:56] approaching it he said so you old Cain
[1:44:58] if you've been a doubter of the word why
[1:45:00] don't you come on over here and let the
[1:45:02] blood change you
[1:45:06] is that right
[1:45:07] because there's Abel inside a king
[1:45:11] Cain will always try to suffocate Abel
[1:45:16] but when Abel receives the power of God
[1:45:19] within him he's able
[1:45:22] he's able
[1:45:24] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:45:26] strengthens me Abel is able
[1:45:30] Evil by what Abel by the strength of God
[1:45:33] within
[1:45:35] it's God dealing with amulet from
[1:45:37] generation to generation
[1:45:41] here is God he don't forget this
[1:45:43] he don't forget see he's dealt with it
[1:45:45] been going down Through the Ages but now
[1:45:48] when it's time for the closing out of
[1:45:50] all things
[1:45:51] here he comes
[1:45:53] and Revelations 10 1.
[1:45:55] I see a mighty angel
[1:45:58] his hands were lifted up to the heavens
[1:46:00] but a very important point about his
[1:46:02] head
[1:46:03] was a rainbow
[1:46:06] Hallelujah what is it he's got his mind
[1:46:09] on his Covenant
[1:46:12] he has remembered his Covenant he has
[1:46:15] remembered his word
[1:46:19] amen what does he come forth to do he's
[1:46:22] come for us to bring about that change
[1:46:25] not just within the soul but that which
[1:46:28] leads to the very change of the body
[1:46:33] he came listen now he had to come and
[1:46:37] reveal himself in son form
[1:46:42] let me come back now I'm trying to come
[1:46:43] back to this and try to he come and
[1:46:46] revealed himself in some form claim that
[1:46:48] part of the Earth
[1:46:49] is that right now through claiming that
[1:46:52] part of the earth now he's Redeeming the
[1:46:55] rest of the earth through the shedding
[1:46:57] of the blood and now the Holy Spirit
[1:46:59] going out down through the dispensation
[1:47:01] of the Son of God the Holy Spirit has
[1:47:03] been going out and it's been collecting
[1:47:05] all of the subjects
[1:47:09] right but now comes now the transition
[1:47:13] from Son of God to Son of Man
[1:47:16] what now coming a son of man notice it's
[1:47:19] Christ himself has he stepped in and
[1:47:22] there he used a little body of a
[1:47:24] Kentuckian
[1:47:26] in the message unveiling of God in 1964
[1:47:28] the prophet said oh I've been keeping
[1:47:30] this from you for all these years now
[1:47:32] veiling Christ
[1:47:36] but it didn't stop there in the message
[1:47:39] Harvest Time the prophet said all that
[1:47:42] seed that went in the ground that seed
[1:47:44] has got to come back up again and he
[1:47:46] said what is that seed coming back up
[1:47:48] again that is the mature Harvest of the
[1:47:50] life that's been planted it's that life
[1:47:53] that has brought the other seeds to
[1:47:54] maturity and now what is it there is a
[1:47:57] people upon the Earth under the ministry
[1:48:00] of the son of man it's the same life
[1:48:04] reproduced back in the people once again
[1:48:07] living that same life it's the son of
[1:48:10] man being revealed
[1:48:13] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:48:18] because as one was raised from the Earth
[1:48:21] and he was waved
[1:48:24] that son of man here he was waved
[1:48:26] showing what there's more to come
[1:48:29] but now at the end
[1:48:31] at the end of time here at the blending
[1:48:33] of Eternity now comes forth
[1:48:36] a message
[1:48:38] with full power
[1:48:43] packs within it full Deliverance
[1:48:47] calls us back think of think of think of
[1:48:49] think of these titles
[1:48:51] spiritual amnesia
[1:48:54] think of the title it calls the people
[1:48:57] back to say why are you living the way
[1:49:00] you're living
[1:49:01] why are you living Beneath Your
[1:49:02] Privilege
[1:49:03] why are you living beneath this what
[1:49:05] does he say you don't know who you are
[1:49:09] so he didn't say you got to escape this
[1:49:11] world and then you'll be victorious no
[1:49:12] no what has he started with you started
[1:49:14] with that of that of that slave who was
[1:49:15] in bondage
[1:49:16] that slave was was in bondage but when
[1:49:19] the people came to look at that slave
[1:49:20] they saw that slave and they said you
[1:49:22] feed him different no do they sleep
[1:49:24] different no
[1:49:25] why is he stand out among all the rest
[1:49:27] oh
[1:49:28] because his daddy listen it's not just
[1:49:31] enough that his daddy is a king he's got
[1:49:33] to know his daddy is a king
[1:49:37] and when he knows his daddy is a king
[1:49:41] when that's revealed it affects his life
[1:49:46] you might still be in slavery
[1:49:50] but it's free right here
[1:49:52] he's a free man right here
[1:49:55] and he can look at that and say
[1:49:57] amalek
[1:50:00] you've already been dealt with
[1:50:02] your change is on its way
[1:50:07] same in you
[1:50:09] right
[1:50:10] he comes to redeem the
[1:50:15] he comes to redeem that small part but
[1:50:18] then from there the rest of it he takes
[1:50:22] he takes the rest of it is that right
[1:50:26] and leads it to a complete change
[1:50:30] it's him in you Christ the hope of glory
[1:50:34] it's him
[1:50:37] that has
[1:50:38] and is manifesting how that he has dealt
[1:50:42] with amalek
[1:50:44] that is why
[1:50:45] the coming of the Holy Ghost in This
[1:50:48] Hour
[1:50:49] is the coming of the abstract
[1:50:52] to the title deed
[1:50:54] these are not just words
[1:50:56] this is a reality
[1:50:59] the abstract is the answer to the sin
[1:51:02] question
[1:51:05] the abstract strikes off all leans
[1:51:13] you know what that means right
[1:51:15] there's nobody can rise up and say oh oh
[1:51:17] by the way there's an overdue tax bill
[1:51:21] too late
[1:51:23] the abstract has searched it all the way
[1:51:26] back
[1:51:30] oh there's an overdue water bill no
[1:51:32] there's not
[1:51:35] that sounds like the accuser of the
[1:51:37] brethren
[1:51:40] come on somebody
[1:51:43] but when you know that abstract you know
[1:51:46] down within all the prophets said and
[1:51:49] standing in the Gap he said oh my when
[1:51:51] that love of Christ has so struck your
[1:51:53] soul in the tenderness of Jesus Christ
[1:51:56] he said the world is dead to you
[1:52:00] you're not trying to see how much you
[1:52:02] can live in the world you're not trying
[1:52:04] to see how close you can get but the
[1:52:06] world it's it's dead to you he said as a
[1:52:08] matter of fact it it's something that to
[1:52:10] you you want to get so far away from not
[1:52:13] how close you can get
[1:52:16] seeing the tenderness of Jesus Christ
[1:52:18] then it's his strength
[1:52:20] in you
[1:52:22] his strength in me
[1:52:25] in his mind
[1:52:27] is on his Covenant
[1:52:29] and there's a people who have been
[1:52:31] admonished by the spirit of God
[1:52:35] go take the little book
[1:52:38] that is open in the hand of the angel
[1:52:41] who standed up there upon the land and
[1:52:45] the Sea go to him
[1:52:49] how would you know to go to him there's
[1:52:51] got to be eyes on Earth that he has come
[1:52:53] to
[1:52:54] you with me this is revelation 7. that
[1:52:58] sounds to Revelation 7 and the sounding
[1:53:01] points you to the mighty angel
[1:53:04] right Christ be with you till we meet
[1:53:07] again
[1:53:09] right
[1:53:10] Christ who is Christ is the deity of
[1:53:13] almighty God
[1:53:14] Christ revealed in his word by his power
[1:53:18] in his people revealed
[1:53:26] there is nothing
[1:53:28] that is too great for him
[1:53:34] nothing a people that is to go take that
[1:53:37] book
[1:53:39] listen friends you can't take that book
[1:53:41] with sin still
[1:53:42] send nature in your life
[1:53:45] you can't do I'm not putting nobody down
[1:53:46] I'm telling you the truth you can't take
[1:53:48] it by sin nature if there are things
[1:53:51] about your life that you know that are
[1:53:53] holding you back
[1:53:54] ask God say Lord
[1:53:56] cleanse Me Lord
[1:54:00] give me Lord God that power in the rod
[1:54:02] to where my life is not just a rod
[1:54:05] but where's the power inside of it
[1:54:09] amen I don't want to keep dealing with
[1:54:12] the same amalekites
[1:54:14] showed you that in the scripture keep
[1:54:15] coming back keep coming back keep coming
[1:54:17] back keep coming back keep coming back
[1:54:28] I believe with all my heart there's a
[1:54:30] maturing
[1:54:32] but I don't want to preach just a
[1:54:34] maturing because if you haven't been
[1:54:36] born again you can't never mature
[1:54:40] is that right unless you're born again
[1:54:43] you can't add virtue knowledge
[1:54:45] Temperance or whatever more it's putting
[1:54:47] peacock feathers in
[1:54:49] are you with me you got it it's got to
[1:54:52] be a birth and then when the birth it
[1:54:54] rises from there sure there's a maturing
[1:54:56] sure there is an increasing of his
[1:54:59] strength and his power and his authority
[1:55:00] in our life absolutely
[1:55:03] watch this
[1:55:05] in the scriptures
[1:55:08] my my
[1:55:13] let's just close
[1:55:15] time
[1:55:19] Joshua
[1:55:21] was down there fighting the battle
[1:55:24] keep this in mind here's Joshua down
[1:55:26] here fighting the battle
[1:55:30] Aaron and her are holding up his hands
[1:55:34] the prophet puts it like this
[1:55:37] in the message stand still
[1:55:40] and he says he says it like this
[1:55:43] he says the children were fighting and
[1:55:47] the sun was going down and the great
[1:55:49] warrior Joshua when the sun was going
[1:55:52] down he needed some more time now watch
[1:55:54] Moses my servant is dead
[1:55:58] right he's over here fighting this
[1:56:01] Joshua's fighting in the land right now
[1:56:03] but although Moses has passed off the
[1:56:06] scene
[1:56:08] his message
[1:56:10] is now coming from prophecy
[1:56:13] into fulfillment
[1:56:15] right
[1:56:16] through the administration of Joshua
[1:56:20] it's the same Angel of the Lord
[1:56:22] it hasn't changed when when when when
[1:56:25] when when
[1:56:25] Moses was God let him know I'm going to
[1:56:29] sin before you and then Moses said who
[1:56:31] is it that thou has said thou with sin
[1:56:33] with me
[1:56:33] right God reveals the same Angel of the
[1:56:37] Lord see God's letting himself know I
[1:56:39] haven't left you I haven't abandoned you
[1:56:41] he lets Moses know that I've sent my
[1:56:43] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:56:45] way and to bring the end of the place
[1:56:46] that I prepared for thee is the same
[1:56:49] Angel of the Lord God here the messenger
[1:56:52] goes off the scene but here Joshua got
[1:56:56] moving in a mini-membered body
[1:57:00] that same Angel of the Lord moving now
[1:57:04] as Joshua comes up upon Jericho
[1:57:12] I said this to you before Joshua didn't
[1:57:15] fight the bottle of Battle of Jericho by
[1:57:18] just knowing a quote
[1:57:20] because there was not any quote
[1:57:24] word for word
[1:57:26] that ever said go around a city seven
[1:57:28] times
[1:57:30] but the god of the message
[1:57:34] the god of Moses
[1:57:37] Joshua knew not just the print
[1:57:41] come on somebody to let her killeth
[1:57:44] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:57:47] life
[1:57:48] you might be looking for an answer and
[1:57:50] you're just looking for a letter answer
[1:57:52] but you say well what do you mean I'm
[1:57:54] just looking for a letter answer because
[1:57:56] the spirit of God when he reveals
[1:57:59] himself he'll never reveal contrary to
[1:58:02] the letter
[1:58:04] but he'll reveal himself by his same
[1:58:07] characteristics
[1:58:09] and he revealed himself to Joshua and
[1:58:13] Joshua recognized him
[1:58:19] but here's Joshua fighting a battle
[1:58:23] he needs more time
[1:58:27] the sun the sun is going down he needs
[1:58:29] the sun to stand up
[1:58:32] can't you see when the sun was going
[1:58:34] down and the enemy was going to Prevail
[1:58:37] and Joshua recognized no the sun can't
[1:58:40] go down
[1:58:42] this battle has got to come to a
[1:58:44] complete victory
[1:58:48] [Music]
[1:58:50] as a Joshua in this hour
[1:58:53] the Church of the Living God who the
[1:58:56] promise has taken hold on it might look
[1:58:58] like that the sun would start to go down
[1:59:00] but there is a people that the day star
[1:59:03] has arose in our hardship
[1:59:08] Hallelujah
[1:59:10] and that day started rising in the
[1:59:12] hearts of sun stand still
[1:59:15] amen what is it the life becoming
[1:59:18] greater more powerful becoming greater
[1:59:21] it's Christ himself dwelling in our
[1:59:24] midst the son of man himself
[1:59:28] and the prophet said it like this
[1:59:31] and God was in the Battle and Moses
[1:59:34] hands was up as it were
[1:59:39] Moses the man was dead
[1:59:42] but his hands were still up
[1:59:45] because there was one on earth a vessel
[1:59:48] of people that that Revelation had
[1:59:51] caught a hold in and that Revelation in
[1:59:54] them
[1:59:56] was not just another horn on the Ram's
[1:59:59] Head but now the full power coming
[2:00:02] together the lamb standing in full View
[2:00:06] and what is it Moses hands are lifted up
[2:00:09] Calvary lifted up the real reality of
[2:00:12] redemption the throne The Sovereign that
[2:00:15] message what is it his hands
[2:00:18] are lifted up
[2:00:21] the abstract living out through you is
[2:00:24] the lifting up
[2:00:25] of the banner
[2:00:27] they abstract in you is declaring
[2:00:30] Jehovah Nissi my life worships
[2:00:35] at the altar that he has revealed
[2:00:37] himself he has revealed himself to me in
[2:00:40] me that he is greater
[2:00:43] he is my answer to the sin question
[2:00:49] Hallelujah
[2:00:51] oh my I believe that was all my heart
[2:00:53] he's here
[2:00:57] yes he is he's here dwelling in a many
[2:01:00] membered body
[2:01:03] he comes right here right through his
[2:01:05] word to bring a change in a life
[2:01:07] yes sir
[2:01:08] you don't have to wait till the end of a
[2:01:10] service that same God while the word is
[2:01:12] coming forth that change can come just
[2:01:14] like that
[2:01:15] absolutely but remember God is Sovereign
[2:01:18] he'll meet you and he meets you
[2:01:20] personally in a way that there is sacred
[2:01:22] Sands of Grace that you're able to stand
[2:01:24] on and no devil can put his dirty foot
[2:01:27] on those sacred Sands of Grace where you
[2:01:29] know that you've met God there is a
[2:01:31] strength within you that though you may
[2:01:33] get grow weak but there's a strength on
[2:01:36] the inside of you there are hands inside
[2:01:38] of you that have never went down there
[2:01:41] is hands inside of you that can never go
[2:01:44] down I'm telling you this Mighty Angel
[2:01:46] his hands are lifted up
[2:01:49] [Applause]
[2:01:51] amen this Christ this Holy Ghost Christ
[2:01:55] in you the hope of glory
[2:01:57] he that is in you greater is he that is
[2:02:01] in you than he that's in the world
[2:02:04] Hallelujah he's brought you forth out of
[2:02:07] the muck and gone all the mud that was
[2:02:09] packed into you but he has moved upon
[2:02:12] your life where there was darkness and
[2:02:14] water covering your life but the spirit
[2:02:17] of God has moved on your life to draw
[2:02:19] you forth and now you are a Lily that
[2:02:23] expresses his life that life that was
[2:02:25] hidden there the whole time what is that
[2:02:28] that's him coming who has dealt with
[2:02:30] Hamlet from generation to generation
[2:02:33] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:02:35] forever his power is still the same
[2:02:40] Hallelujah
[2:02:42] hallelujah amen he still delivers he
[2:02:46] still heals the sick he still cleanses
[2:02:49] he still feels with the Holy Ghost
[2:02:55] Hallelujah
[2:02:57] amen is the right of God that is Hell
[2:03:00] over the people of God what is that Rod
[2:03:03] of God the wave chief
[2:03:05] [Applause]
[2:03:08] amen it's Christ
[2:03:11] waved over the people
[2:03:15] it's not going down
[2:03:17] because it's him
[2:03:18] he is the standard in US
[2:03:22] Jehovah Nissi
[2:03:25] Banner standard inside rallying point
[2:03:40] I just witnessed
[2:03:43] I'm watching the Civil War presentation
[2:03:46] and a little thing we went to
[2:03:49] and here the guys were speaking to us
[2:03:51] saying you know they got rid of the
[2:03:53] drummers
[2:03:54] after a while because the guys could not
[2:03:56] hear tell the difference between the
[2:03:57] drums
[2:03:58] and the sounds of guns
[2:04:00] essentially what they went to
[2:04:03] was bugles
[2:04:05] because bugles didn't sound like gunfire
[2:04:08] but bugles would let you know which way
[2:04:09] to move
[2:04:10] and he said you know those swords that
[2:04:12] They carried on the side he said those
[2:04:14] swords he said now this is the thing
[2:04:16] that's different for us and for them
[2:04:18] those swords he said were not sharp
[2:04:19] those swords were not used to slice
[2:04:21] people and so forth they were more
[2:04:23] ceremonial but in the midst of the
[2:04:25] battle this is what I want to draw your
[2:04:27] point to he said in the midst of the
[2:04:29] battle they couldn't hear the commands
[2:04:31] but they would find their leader he said
[2:04:33] because they had the leader would have
[2:04:35] the sword and he said notice how the Sun
[2:04:38] Shines off the sword
[2:04:40] and find their leader in which way the
[2:04:42] sword was pointing that's the way there
[2:04:45] to go
[2:04:47] Hallelujah and the sword of the word
[2:04:50] doesn't know Nanny retreat
[2:04:55] for the spirit of the living creatures
[2:04:58] is in the wheels
[2:05:00] is that right and everywhere they went
[2:05:03] they went forward and the word itself
[2:05:05] now that's what we're looking at Jesus
[2:05:07] Christ notice they can look up to the
[2:05:09] hill and Moses hands being lifted up
[2:05:12] they were gaining strength they were
[2:05:14] fighting and we see that sword what is
[2:05:17] it it's the light reflecting off the
[2:05:19] sword the sword is being held up
[2:05:24] Oh Glory God who raised up that sword
[2:05:27] God
[2:05:29] who gave the sword God
[2:05:32] Grace provided the sword
[2:05:35] the prophet just had to put his hands up
[2:05:40] that's the same thing with you and I all
[2:05:41] you got to do is put your hands up you
[2:05:43] put your hands up the sword comes down
[2:05:45] you put your heart up the hand the sword
[2:05:47] comes down because then you're saying I
[2:05:50] Surrender but he himself steps into your
[2:05:52] life and Through Your Surrender he
[2:05:55] becomes your strength he becomes your
[2:05:58] power and you become his glory
[2:06:05] it's about it
[2:06:10] I say this friends to you in the name of
[2:06:12] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:15] let God
[2:06:16] let God
[2:06:18] do
[2:06:19] let him move let him prove what he
[2:06:21] himself
[2:06:23] has already done
[2:06:25] and Desiring to come and do
[2:06:32] let's pray
[2:06:34] Lord Jesus
[2:06:37] there's no more Lord that
[2:06:39] my strength Lord is gone
[2:06:44] but Lord I realize you have spoke to us
[2:06:46] today
[2:06:48] you have made yourself known that it's
[2:06:50] only you alone
[2:06:53] deals with amalek
[2:06:55] nobody else
[2:06:57] cantame amalek
[2:06:59] can't tame him
[2:07:01] there's only one way Lord God and that's
[2:07:03] for you to deal with him
[2:07:07] well it's sitting right here this
[2:07:08] morning no doubt here under my voice
[2:07:10] some Lord that may be streaming others
[2:07:12] that would hear the message maybe in
[2:07:13] another time
[2:07:15] father
[2:07:17] I pray this morning Lord God if there's
[2:07:19] one that's sitting here in our midst
[2:07:21] Lord
[2:07:22] that father that doesn't know you in
[2:07:24] that way
[2:07:26] I pray that Lord God that this will be
[2:07:28] the turning point
[2:07:30] of their life Lord
[2:07:32] that they would see just how great
[2:07:34] your curious Lord
[2:07:37] but you're not more pointing out or
[2:07:39] picking on weakness or feebleness Lord
[2:07:42] but father you deal Lord God with the
[2:07:44] very depths of man in the soul
[2:07:47] Lord to where you bring it in a reality
[2:07:50] that we
[2:07:51] receive Lord and endude with strength
[2:07:55] life
[2:07:56] A Love Affair Lord that goes down to the
[2:07:59] inside
[2:08:01] or true that
[2:08:03] sitting right here Lord also speaking to
[2:08:05] many
[2:08:06] the Lord no doubt Lord they have already
[2:08:09] crossed
[2:08:10] they've put Lord they've been placed
[2:08:13] into that land
[2:08:16] that land of adoption Lord
[2:08:18] started with their soul
[2:08:20] it'll lead to the very change of the
[2:08:22] body
[2:08:24] the Lord
[2:08:25] it's not saying the Lord that lives and
[2:08:28] hearts cannot be tempted that's true
[2:08:30] look at me tinted Lord but father we're
[2:08:33] in the love of the world is passed away
[2:08:34] from within Lord
[2:08:36] it's something that Lord God where
[2:08:37] there's a resistance against him
[2:08:40] there's no desire Lord the desire of the
[2:08:42] world
[2:08:45] Lord Jesus I believe that that's your
[2:08:47] intention
[2:08:48] your purpose
[2:08:49] that father that
[2:08:51] you would make known that you are still
[2:08:54] the same God
[2:08:57] you're mindful Lord of your word where
[2:09:00] men Lord have misconstrued it and I
[2:09:02] don't just say men because it wasn't
[2:09:04] just men acting on their own accord but
[2:09:06] Lord where that the enemy has always
[2:09:08] wanted to try to displace
[2:09:11] pervert the real true birth
[2:09:13] the Lord God we see down Through the
[2:09:16] Ages where men Lord God where that
[2:09:18] message would go forth they would lift
[2:09:20] it up Lord by strength Luther lifted it
[2:09:23] up Lord in justification
[2:09:26] the Lord God there had to come a greater
[2:09:29] strength a greater more of the same
[2:09:31] power
[2:09:33] into sanctification then more of the
[2:09:36] same power Lord in the restoration of
[2:09:38] the gifts
[2:09:40] and then Lord God more of the same power
[2:09:43] but now coming in completion
[2:09:46] in fullness the finishing of the mystery
[2:09:50] of God
[2:09:52] Lord Jesus
[2:09:55] this is the
[2:09:56] very moments Lord God
[2:09:59] that all creation
[2:10:01] has longed in his longing form
[2:10:05] it's what Lord God that you've longed
[2:10:07] for
[2:10:10] Lord Jesus
[2:10:13] to one day see us
[2:10:15] Lord God
[2:10:18] Brian Lord coming down the aisle Lord
[2:10:21] Hearts have already been United
[2:10:24] In A Love Affair but yet that groom is
[2:10:27] going to see that bride
[2:10:29] dressed
[2:10:30] in a wedding dress
[2:10:32] he's going to see her in a garment that
[2:10:35] he's never saw her in before
[2:10:38] the Lord unlike
[2:10:39] unlike us
[2:10:42] you already saw us in this garment
[2:10:45] picture of us Lord
[2:10:49] Lord God then you place that
[2:10:52] negative
[2:10:54] there's a pawn there's a negative that's
[2:10:56] made off of a positive
[2:10:57] that negative is submitted down here
[2:10:59] into this Earth Lord
[2:11:01] but when it's quickened it begins to
[2:11:03] develop in our life
[2:11:05] it doesn't all the way look like the
[2:11:07] complete picture Lord
[2:11:09] but it continues to develop in our life
[2:11:12] same way it is the Lord God with every
[2:11:14] child of God
[2:11:16] it's that life within us Lord that's
[2:11:17] developing
[2:11:19] at first Lord there's a there's a lot of
[2:11:21] things that can be Lord kind of looks a
[2:11:23] little fuzzy
[2:11:24] remember kind of looking at certain
[2:11:26] things and so forth but Lord God the
[2:11:28] more that that negative begins to move
[2:11:30] Lord
[2:11:31] and begins to Lord come forth that image
[2:11:34] that's there on the negative made off of
[2:11:37] the positive continues to become more
[2:11:39] clear
[2:11:42] that's the way your life is in US
[2:11:46] lord it's your strength
[2:11:48] moving through our weakness Lord
[2:11:52] it's your strength Lord moving through
[2:11:55] US Lord
[2:11:56] to wear things Lord God that once
[2:11:59] tempted us
[2:12:00] bothered us
[2:12:02] the Lord God
[2:12:04] it grows in our life
[2:12:06] develops in our life
[2:12:09] and we grow stronger Lord
[2:12:11] more and more
[2:12:13] what we find Lord God
[2:12:15] is that has you moved in Lord to our
[2:12:18] soul
[2:12:19] and we find Lord God by the effects of
[2:12:21] that new birth
[2:12:23] we have received the strength
[2:12:25] to be able to bring
[2:12:28] this outer man
[2:12:30] in line
[2:12:31] with the word of God
[2:12:39] by your strength
[2:12:42] by your strength Lord I pray this
[2:12:46] morning Lord God
[2:12:49] Lord you will just have your way make
[2:12:50] your word
[2:12:52] Lord just further personal Lord as we
[2:12:54] move into another part of the service
[2:12:56] make it further personal Lord to each
[2:12:59] life in each Heart Lord what they would
[2:13:01] have need of in their life Lord
[2:13:03] maybe lord it's something Lord that
[2:13:05] Lord had just
[2:13:07] trouble the Lord
[2:13:09] something Lord God
[2:13:11] the Lord I pray that father
[2:13:14] May Lord God from within
[2:13:17] pulling the Lord from that depth of the
[2:13:19] Lord
[2:13:20] they don't have that depth within Lord
[2:13:22] may they receive that this morning
[2:13:24] and father then from that depth Lord
[2:13:26] within their soul lord of your life
[2:13:28] within them
[2:13:30] in them bringing their life into
[2:13:31] subjection
[2:13:35] granted Lord
[2:13:37] by that inward desire Lord
[2:13:39] you are our Perfection Lord
[2:13:42] you are our strength Lord Jesus
[2:13:46] Lord God I pray that father for each and
[2:13:48] every one of us Lord
[2:13:50] we realize the Lord God that
[2:13:53] it isn't something Lord Jesus that when
[2:13:56] you Lord have done such a complete work
[2:13:59] doesn't mean that Lord God that we're
[2:14:00] not going to have to fight and we're not
[2:14:02] going to have to battle we are
[2:14:04] but Lord may we keep
[2:14:06] every weak place
[2:14:08] may we keep it covered with the blood of
[2:14:11] Jesus Christ any feeble area Lord God
[2:14:14] may we recognize the Lord that it's not
[2:14:16] sometimes just the area Lord but it's
[2:14:18] things that contribute
[2:14:20] help us Lord I pray
[2:14:24] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:14:27] granted this morning Lord for every need
[2:14:31] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:14:34] amen Hallelujah
[2:14:37] now let's stand if you'd like
[2:14:40] Hallelujah could we just worship him
[2:14:42] here just a little bit
[2:14:44] amen just
[2:14:47] just loving
[2:14:51] you know this part of the service
[2:14:53] sometimes I know I've I've kept you a
[2:14:55] little bit longer here I know that I've
[2:14:57] got a clock right in front of me here
[2:14:59] friends listen this is more important
[2:15:01] than anything else in life
[2:15:03] it's not it's not about hearing me
[2:15:04] that's not what I'm talking to you about
[2:15:06] I'm talking about the word right here
[2:15:07] that word is more important it's
[2:15:10] strengthening it's what God does within
[2:15:12] our life it's this very thing that God
[2:15:14] can come right back a line around and
[2:15:16] you don't know what you're going to face
[2:15:17] this coming week or what you might face
[2:15:18] coming up but God knows about it he
[2:15:21] knows
[2:15:23] and God is mindful he's merciful to give
[2:15:25] to you what you have need of in your
[2:15:27] life
[2:15:29] I encourage any one of you if you don't
[2:15:30] know the Lord Jesus Christ your savior I
[2:15:33] encourage you to receive him as your
[2:15:34] lord and savior if you've not repented I
[2:15:36] encourage you to repent if you've never
[2:15:38] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:15:39] Jesus Christ I encourage you
[2:15:42] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:15:44] Jesus Christ
[2:15:47] that then
[2:15:48] he can move so fully
[2:15:51] and freely we in your life to come down
[2:15:53] and complete that work that he desires
[2:15:56] to do
[2:15:58] let's just worship him let let the reign
[2:16:00] of the Holy Spirit now just let it come
[2:16:02] and just let it soak down upon that seed
[2:16:05] you see if you just if you just take a
[2:16:07] seed a seed's awful hard
[2:16:09] seed is hard
[2:16:11] but when you you plant a seed the first
[2:16:13] thing to tell you to do is water that
[2:16:14] dirt real good because as you water that
[2:16:17] real good it actually encloses that
[2:16:20] moisture around the seed and it's
[2:16:22] actually that moisture that closes
[2:16:24] around the seed that'll actually soften
[2:16:26] and cause that part that is around the
[2:16:28] seed to begin to give way and then what
[2:16:31] is inside that seed the pulp and The
[2:16:33] Germ can actually start to come forth
[2:16:37] though it's under the ground it's not
[2:16:39] seen it's not visible it's not heard but
[2:16:41] it can start to come forth
[2:16:43] now we realize it's not the organ it's
[2:16:45] not the piano it's not the drums it's
[2:16:47] not the guitar it's not the music it's
[2:16:49] it's worshiping remember he's revealed
[2:16:51] himself as Jehovah Nissi whether we had
[2:16:54] music up here or not it's worshiping the
[2:16:56] Lord we worship at the altar of where he
[2:16:59] has revealed himself in his word to be
[2:17:02] our Banner
