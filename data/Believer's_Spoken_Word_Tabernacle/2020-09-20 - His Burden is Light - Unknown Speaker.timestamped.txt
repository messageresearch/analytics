[42:07] the mission offerings that had come in
[42:10] over the course of the sundays of
[42:12] those needs that we were trying to
[42:15] minister to there in the philippines
[42:18] um from different needs from
[42:21] the helping out of that that church
[42:23] building that was in
[42:25] palauan and where
[42:28] they were in need of funds to complete
[42:30] the project and there was about uh
[42:32] a thousand dollars is what they were in
[42:34] need of in order to complete that
[42:37] and uh that doesn't sound like maybe
[42:39] well it sounds like a lot to me but
[42:41] it probably don't seem like a lot
[42:42] compared to things we think about
[42:44] knowing the cost of things here but um
[42:46] the trade-off over there
[42:48] is is um obviously you know it's a
[42:51] over in other countries the american
[42:53] dollar is a precious thing
[42:55] and so they um you know they're able to
[42:58] to to purchase a little bit more things
[43:00] and obviously
[43:01] uh you know even the way that their
[43:03] their church building and how
[43:04] they would go about it that was that
[43:06] allowed them to be able to finish that
[43:08] uh to a place to be able to gather
[43:12] and to worship there so they've been
[43:13] doing that during this time of the covid
[43:16] because
[43:16] a lot of these things and perhaps some
[43:18] of you know this but
[43:20] really a lot of the things that we've
[43:22] experienced as far as we say you know
[43:24] inconveniences and that's really what
[43:26] it's been and
[43:27] you know and and when i say inconvenient
[43:30] you understand we
[43:31] things that we do we don't necessarily
[43:33] like doing them but we do them because
[43:35] it's
[43:35] you know certain things have been asked
[43:38] and certain things have been
[43:40] you know spoken in here and there so um
[43:43] they they themselves many of these
[43:45] places have not even been able to meet
[43:47] as a matter of fact brother roell and
[43:48] them
[43:49] when i spoke to you they were just
[43:51] getting ready to have
[43:53] their first in-person gathering again
[43:56] and that had been
[43:57] all my five months and some of the other
[44:00] places right now in other countries of
[44:02] the world
[44:03] they can't gather at all uh you know
[44:05] there's just i've been actually
[44:07] a brother had asked me to do a meeting
[44:10] i've got to do a meeting over
[44:12] streaming down into one of the other
[44:15] countries
[44:16] that had asked me to to minister and so
[44:18] i've got to do that
[44:20] you pray for me i told him just to give
[44:22] me the date because i'll have to preach
[44:24] at three in the morning
[44:26] in order to get to them so um and that's
[44:29] brother uh brian naidu from south africa
[44:31] and they had
[44:32] so i i just i said oh lord help me that
[44:35] at three three in the morning or
[44:37] something like that and may god help me
[44:39] that sunday morning when i have to stand
[44:40] here and preach
[44:41] amen but uh you know little things like
[44:44] this that you find out as you go along
[44:46] that my
[44:46] it just is a little bit of a it's a
[44:48] blessing you know little avenues you
[44:50] find out but
[44:51] there's nothing like being together with
[44:53] with saints of like precious faith
[44:56] there's nothing like getting together
[44:58] amen with believers and when the
[45:00] pillar of fire because more and more
[45:02] believers you get together you have
[45:03] licks of fire that are coming together
[45:05] and
[45:06] it's just something special about that
[45:08] and so we want to say thank you because
[45:10] the
[45:11] the offerings themselves of what had
[45:13] come in i think was around
[45:15] close to my mind serves me correctly
[45:18] around close to about
[45:20] twenty eight hundred dollars or what
[45:21] have you and we we just went ahead from
[45:23] the mission uh funds that are set there
[45:26] and thank you
[45:27] uh every month as you have been giving
[45:30] throughout the months toward the mission
[45:32] offerings that allows us to be able to
[45:34] when different needs would come up
[45:35] be able to put with that so we we put
[45:38] with that twenty eight hundred dollars
[45:40] and i i think i've rounded it up there
[45:42] we we we added with that incent an
[45:44] offering of four thousand dollars to
[45:46] brother roell
[45:47] soriano and that's that's going to go to
[45:50] feed because many of the people in their
[45:51] church
[45:52] have not been able to work so
[45:56] they're you know just doing all they can
[45:58] so thank you for that
[46:00] um the other thing that i want to do
[46:03] here this morning
[46:04] is um at times you know
[46:08] we we haven't altogether had
[46:11] different uh brothers and so forth you
[46:15] know
[46:16] that maybe have felt a burden on their
[46:20] heart and where we had to
[46:21] mention things in regards to an office
[46:24] in the church and we
[46:25] recognize that there are officers in the
[46:28] church and brothers who take on
[46:30] these burdens in their heart and it's
[46:32] not something that
[46:34] they do because they have to but it's
[46:37] something that that god puts in their
[46:39] heart i believe firmly that god works on
[46:40] both ends
[46:42] and so you know i want to
[46:45] just say it like this that at the
[46:47] request of the trustees when
[46:49] even when we had met in december and
[46:50] other things they had expressed their
[46:52] desire to see younger ones
[46:54] step up and carry the burden that they
[46:57] have faithfully carried and
[46:59] that was really a desire in their heart
[47:01] and so
[47:02] that some of them have carried this
[47:04] burden since the beginning of the
[47:05] assembly and so
[47:08] what i'd like to do is the trustee board
[47:10] along with myself
[47:11] i have recommended brother aaron bemet
[47:13] to serve this local body of believers in
[47:15] the office of trustee
[47:17] and uh we certainly thank the lord for
[47:19] brother aaron
[47:20] and his lovely family and um so we're
[47:23] thankful for what the lord has done
[47:25] within
[47:26] their lives and what god continues to do
[47:28] and
[47:29] as a couple you remember i think it was
[47:31] back in um
[47:32] it was back in december that seems like
[47:34] eons ago but
[47:35] that was 2019 maybe we can go to 2019
[47:38] and skip to 2021
[47:40] but uh because 2020 just been a blur
[47:44] hadn't it
[47:45] you know blur over top of the masks but
[47:48] we remember in december uh this
[47:52] is one of the the parts that um where
[47:54] there's a couple brother aaron sister
[47:56] amanda they took on that burden
[47:58] that brother bill and sister mary had
[47:59] carried so long uh with setting up the
[48:01] fellowship dinners and other events so
[48:03] we certainly think that they they uh
[48:06] about when they were getting into it
[48:08] then all this
[48:10] coveted 19 and everything else started
[48:12] in on us so
[48:13] um but i want to um after asking brother
[48:17] aaron to preferably consider this
[48:20] um he confided that even the burden the
[48:22] lord had already placed on his heart and
[48:24] that that's that's what i like to see
[48:26] is that god's already placed the burden
[48:28] on on the heart
[48:30] so we would like to present him to you
[48:32] this morning uh
[48:34] and and to take a vote on this and
[48:36] remember uh the vote itself
[48:38] it's not like it's not like what is a
[48:40] nation we're preparing to do
[48:42] in november uh but when we vote because
[48:45] a congregation
[48:46] elects its deacons trustees and a pastor
[48:49] and treasurer and so forth
[48:51] all of these things itself this is not
[48:54] that's political
[48:55] this is not political right the thing
[48:57] that a vote when we recognize what a
[48:59] vote is in the scripture when
[49:01] when the people already saw in
[49:04] david what was present they when they
[49:07] came to put the king the crown on
[49:09] david's head
[49:10] they said that was t that led us in and
[49:13] out of battle
[49:14] when saul was here see the only thing
[49:16] the vote was is
[49:17] they are a committing in confidence to
[49:20] the leadership of the lord
[49:22] so these are the things that we
[49:23] recognize as brother branham taught us
[49:25] that
[49:26] he said you know when a deacon a trustee
[49:28] a pastor you know
[49:29] they're voted in they serve until and he
[49:32] said if their one decides to step down
[49:34] uh every year the trustee or deacon you
[49:36] know if they and him decide that they
[49:39] want to step down they're more unable to
[49:40] at the end of that year
[49:42] and um you know and and so if they
[49:45] would desire to do that then then the
[49:47] deacons and trustees and
[49:49] they can you know who would they appoint
[49:51] who would they look at that would be
[49:53] a faithful uh brother to serve within
[49:55] that capacity and then we
[49:57] pray about that and look at it and so
[49:59] that's where we've come to
[50:00] here this morning and to bring brother
[50:03] aaron
[50:05] bema to present him before the
[50:06] congregation to serve in the office of a
[50:08] trustee so
[50:09] what i'm going to ask i'm not going to
[50:10] pass out paper ballots or anything like
[50:12] that i'm just going to ask you to
[50:13] bow your heads at this time if by your
[50:16] heads everyone
[50:17] young people all children and things

[50:28] with your tithe
[50:29] and offerings which is considered a
[50:32] member of this church
[50:33] while myself alone looks on i would ask
[50:37] if this
[50:37] church finds brother aaron beam it to be
[50:40] a just man
[50:41] and eligible by the best of their
[50:43] thinking to be a trustee to serve the
[50:45] local body here

[50:50] agree that brother aaron
[50:52] is a just man eligible the best of your

[51:11] okay all right god bless you raise your
[51:14] you can raise your heads

[56:55] in a special way
[56:56] we love you and thank you in the name of
[56:58] jesus christ amen
[57:00] god bless you as you're being seated
[57:12] in the patmos vision brother branham
[57:16] he takes this this
[57:19] scripture and he says how
[57:22] we receive this rest or the continuing
[57:26] sabbath
[57:28] is at the invitation of jesus
[57:31] no matter how long you've been laboring
[57:33] under your load of sin
[57:35] whether it's 10 years 30 years
[57:38] or 50 years or longer
[57:42] come with your tired weary life
[57:45] and you will find his rest the true
[57:49] sabbath
[57:50] jesus will give you rest
[57:53] think when brother branham went beyond
[57:54] the curtain of time and
[57:57] one of the first ones that would come to
[57:59] him
[58:00] you'd never know about how she looked in
[58:02] that body
[58:03] there was no trace of of death no trace
[58:06] of sin
[58:08] that is there in that body that body
[58:12] that that particular sister that came to
[58:14] him was just
[58:15] it was within the same age of even his
[58:19] little daughter sharon rose and remember
[58:22] the
[58:22] the the lord spoke to him at that time
[58:25] and said
[58:26] she was 90 years old when you let her to
[58:29] the lord
[58:31] you know that when you think of that
[58:33] woman and where she would have been
[58:34] and you think of her i think of where
[58:38] you know where the the the older uh
[58:41] gentleman was where brother branham went
[58:42] squirrel hunting
[58:43] and remember he was a proclaimed infidel
[58:46] he didn't believe in god and
[58:48] you know there's a lot of things he had
[58:49] seen that you know that have been
[58:51] just it brought skeptics i mean there's
[58:53] a lot of things we find that people now
[58:55] they say
[58:56] i don't want religion and i just tell
[58:58] you the truth like i told a man one time
[59:00] standing in panera i said i don't want
[59:02] religion neither
[59:04] because religion don't do no good
[59:05] religion's only a covering
[59:07] religion really don't deal with what the
[59:09] real issue is
[59:11] religion doesn't free you it binds you
[59:15] but but the word of god the holy ghost
[59:18] it sets you free
[59:20] and here the spirit of god moved down on
[59:22] the prophet and you know
[59:23] as you hear brother battlement tell that
[59:25] tell that particular
[59:26] instance with that gentleman who was
[59:28] standing there and he's looking and
[59:30] and brother banham takes under under the
[59:32] unction of the spirit of god and begins
[59:34] to preach
[59:35] jesus christ the living god and
[59:39] showing how god is identified in nature
[59:41] he takes that of the apple tree
[59:43] and to think he took that text and here
[59:46] that man could not deny it brought him
[59:49] in a place to recognize that the same
[59:51] god
[59:51] who is over and orchestrates all that in
[59:54] nature
[59:55] is the same god who healed that lady of
[59:57] cancer
[59:58] so it's the same god showing that he
[1:00:01] he is alive and and he is well and that
[1:00:04] person no matter how long that they've
[1:00:06] labored
[1:00:06] underneath that load of sin the
[1:00:08] weariness of it that they can be
[1:00:11] set free and so we thank god and we
[1:00:14] thank god this morning for that reality
[1:00:16] we thank god
[1:00:17] for the invitation that's given because
[1:00:19] the reality of the gospel does not
[1:00:21] push anybody away let me just tell you
[1:00:23] right now if there is any spirit
[1:00:26] any voice that tells you this is not for
[1:00:29] you
[1:00:29] right here i've just read in the
[1:00:30] scripture that's contrary to that voice
[1:00:33] you've got a right to call that voice a
[1:00:35] liar because when jesus came
[1:00:37] he said come unto me
[1:00:41] and that same jesus though not here in a
[1:00:43] corporal body
[1:00:44] but he's here in the body of his
[1:00:46] believers
[1:00:47] and that same call is going out even yet
[1:00:50] this morning
[1:00:51] come unto me all ye that are heavy laden
[1:00:56] and i will give you rest amen he didn't
[1:00:59] call us to a church
[1:01:01] he called us to himself amen and he said
[1:01:05] everyone defy everyone that the father
[1:01:07] has given me i
[1:01:08] i will in no ways cast out so right now
[1:01:11] when the enemy tells you
[1:01:12] well this isn't for you uh you know this
[1:01:15] isn't about you
[1:01:16] i look at your life he's trying to take
[1:01:18] circumstances and isolate you
[1:01:20] but you've got an authority you might
[1:01:23] say you don't know where i'm at in my
[1:01:24] life
[1:01:25] but to believe is an authority that
[1:01:28] renders the devil
[1:01:29] helpless you can stand on that word and
[1:01:32] say i've got a personal
[1:01:34] invitation amen
[1:01:40] in isaiah 28 verse 8
[1:01:44] for all tables are full of vomit
[1:01:47] and filthiness so that there is no place
[1:01:49] clean
[1:01:50] i don't think anybody would want to go
[1:01:52] to a table with vomit and filthiness on
[1:01:54] it
[1:01:55] the table is talking about teaching
[1:01:59] are you with me it's talking about
[1:02:01] teaching we're talking about teaching
[1:02:04] that that that wants to cover filthiness
[1:02:07] that wants to make allowances for
[1:02:09] filthiness
[1:02:11] that allows sin to continue on
[1:02:14] they just say well you know god loves
[1:02:16] you and god understands
[1:02:18] but that's not a table of the lord the
[1:02:21] table of the lord
[1:02:22] there is power amen amen in the
[1:02:25] sacrifice
[1:02:26] that has been offered our passover
[1:02:30] jesus christ to loosen you
[1:02:33] from sins hold amen
[1:02:36] amen the table of listen everyone when
[1:02:40] you look at
[1:02:40] the idols and you see these temples and
[1:02:43] you know i've been in other countries
[1:02:44] and you know that maybe you've seen them
[1:02:46] with pictures and stuff like that
[1:02:47] look every one of them places they bring
[1:02:49] in offerings sometimes they'll bring in
[1:02:51] nice cakes and food and everything else
[1:02:54] and they set them before that statue and
[1:02:56] that god and rats come around in there
[1:02:59] and they eat it all up
[1:03:00] when you look at it it allows them to
[1:03:02] continue
[1:03:03] in the life they're in it's not a bond
[1:03:05] it's a bondage it's not a liberty
[1:03:08] now when you bring that on down you
[1:03:10] might look at it and say
[1:03:11] well this is not a church where buddha
[1:03:13] is worshipped or this is worship
[1:03:15] but remember they in order to worship
[1:03:17] god is to worship him
[1:03:19] in spirit and in truth
[1:03:23] and the living god he never he never
[1:03:26] come that we would continue
[1:03:28] in our own burdens but that our burdens
[1:03:31] might be
[1:03:32] lifted
[1:03:36] whom look at this whom shall he teach
[1:03:38] knowledge
[1:03:39] and whom shall he make to understand
[1:03:41] doctrine them
[1:03:43] that are winged from the milk and drawn
[1:03:46] from the breast for precept look how
[1:03:49] look at this says
[1:03:50] for precept must be upon precept
[1:03:54] precept upon precept line up online
[1:03:58] line upon line hear a little and they're
[1:04:01] a little
[1:04:02] you recognize that this scripture
[1:04:05] that it is speaking that there that
[1:04:08] that the channel there must be a true
[1:04:11] channel
[1:04:12] that is opened a true channel of the
[1:04:15] word
[1:04:15] that that people might come into that
[1:04:19] rest the preaching of the word let me
[1:04:24] just
[1:04:24] just try to you know bring this down
[1:04:26] it's the preaching
[1:04:27] of the gospel that brings jesus on the
[1:04:31] scene
[1:04:32] amen let me just say brother brown would
[1:04:34] say it like this over and over through
[1:04:36] the message
[1:04:36] he said we just don't need the preaching
[1:04:39] of the word
[1:04:40] we need the holy ghost
[1:04:43] we need the saith the lord
[1:04:47] that's what we need that's what we look
[1:04:49] forward to
[1:04:50] when we are coming here into these
[1:04:52] services we're not just coming to hear
[1:04:54] the preaching of the word we need
[1:04:56] something much greater than that
[1:04:58] we need thus saith the lord and god has
[1:05:01] given to you and i
[1:05:02] thus saith the lord in this hour
[1:05:07] hallelujah this word has power within it
[1:05:11] amen glory be to god and when the gospel
[1:05:14] is preached remember
[1:05:16] there's a lot of people that there were
[1:05:18] individuals will
[1:05:19] look for revival but remember you can't
[1:05:22] get revival outside of the word
[1:05:26] you can maybe get emotion where people
[1:05:28] get worked up in emotion
[1:05:30] but you cannot get true revival and
[1:05:33] revival
[1:05:34] is where the trash is cleaned out
[1:05:37] amen it's where lives are made clean
[1:05:40] and pure and then where god comes
[1:05:43] himself
[1:05:44] to live inside of that heart the
[1:05:47] preaching
[1:05:48] of the gospel is the channel of the word
[1:05:52] just like when david david wanted a
[1:05:54] revival
[1:05:55] he knew god had promised a revival he
[1:05:57] knew that the ark of the covenant
[1:06:00] it belonged back in jerusalem he knew
[1:06:03] the
[1:06:04] philistines had it but in order for that
[1:06:06] ark he knew it's got to come back to
[1:06:08] jerusalem
[1:06:09] but david consulted the captains of
[1:06:12] thousands he consulted the priest
[1:06:16] and remember when he did it got a man
[1:06:18] killed
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:20] he had good motives are you with me he
[1:06:22] had good objectives
[1:06:24] but he was not following the pathway
[1:06:28] of the word and in order for revival to
[1:06:30] come
[1:06:31] for the rest to come for the holy ghost
[1:06:33] to come
[1:06:34] it comes according to the path of the
[1:06:37] word
[1:06:37] because jesus said he said he will send
[1:06:40] the holy ghost
[1:06:41] in my name and his name
[1:06:44] is his person his character
[1:06:47] his life being revealed
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:52] this is what peter took up on the day of
[1:06:54] pentecost
[1:06:56] he began to preach what had been
[1:06:59] listen now what had been revealed
[1:07:02] he began to preach what had been
[1:07:05] revealed
[1:07:06] who it was that came out of the shadows
[1:07:09] out of the types and walked with them in
[1:07:12] luke 24. he began to preach
[1:07:15] that this this same jesus he began to
[1:07:18] preach that
[1:07:18] now notice when he when there was a
[1:07:20] request and a call
[1:07:22] god put a burden on peter's heart for
[1:07:24] that request they had
[1:07:26] looked for the coming of the holy ghost
[1:07:29] you realize the church
[1:07:30] they were posted in that hour they knew
[1:07:33] that with the coming of the messiah
[1:07:35] there would come forth the holy spirit
[1:07:37] you see
[1:07:38] it's not our minds cannot tie the
[1:07:40] scriptures together
[1:07:42] we don't even know where to go in the
[1:07:43] scripture unless the holy ghost
[1:07:46] would come and point us brother brown
[1:07:48] stands in the message the rapture and
[1:07:50] he's
[1:07:50] trying to express to the people in the
[1:07:52] opening about the message of the
[1:07:54] hour and you hear that term and he's
[1:07:56] saying well that's god what it is it's
[1:07:57] god's promise
[1:07:58] he's made for this hour he said see we
[1:08:01] wouldn't even know where to go
[1:08:02] in the scripture but you see he has led
[1:08:05] us to that place
[1:08:06] in the scripture that belongs to you and
[1:08:09] i you see a man cannot lead you there
[1:08:12] it takes the holy ghost god can work
[1:08:14] through a man
[1:08:15] but it takes the holy ghost to lead us
[1:08:18] to where
[1:08:18] our position i promise for this day to
[1:08:21] where you don't only look at it as
[1:08:23] that's a promise of god
[1:08:25] but when god starts dealing with your
[1:08:26] heart you say that's my promise
[1:08:30] that's my promise lord it be to god it
[1:08:33] becomes
[1:08:34] personal amen
[1:08:35] [Music]
[1:08:37] so it must be the word
[1:08:40] in order to bring word results bible
[1:08:43] results
[1:08:44] it's got to be the living word of god
[1:08:50] same thing when peter stood in the house
[1:08:52] of cornelius
[1:08:53] remember he was sent he was sent
[1:08:56] an angel came to cornelius and said go
[1:08:59] down here
[1:09:00] and there's one in there by the name
[1:09:02] simon a tanner
[1:09:05] i want you to sin for him he sent for
[1:09:07] him and peter when he came back
[1:09:09] in acts 10 he preached that jesus christ
[1:09:14] was indeed not only crucified but he
[1:09:17] arose
[1:09:18] he was the fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:09:20] you know what peter was doing
[1:09:21] he was setting before that not a
[1:09:24] historical
[1:09:25] event he was bringing them to the
[1:09:27] realization
[1:09:28] that what was done that god is here
[1:09:32] to make good on the debt that was paid
[1:09:35] he's present to release you from your
[1:09:38] burdens
[1:09:45] verse 11 for with stammering lips
[1:09:48] and another tongue will he speak to his
[1:09:51] people
[1:09:52] to whom he said this is the rest
[1:09:55] wherewith
[1:09:56] you may cause the weary to rest
[1:10:00] and this is the refreshing yet they
[1:10:02] would not hear
[1:10:04] man i remember that weariness
[1:10:07] hallelujah i remember that i remember
[1:10:10] when i got
[1:10:10] i got weary i got tired i realized i
[1:10:13] couldn't help myself
[1:10:16] i realized that i needed him
[1:10:19] i didn't just need a church i needed him
[1:10:23] i needed to meet him i didn't even know
[1:10:25] how to articulate all that
[1:10:27] but it was a weariness the weariness is
[1:10:29] when you finally you come to your
[1:10:31] end
[1:10:34] when you come to your end when you're
[1:10:36] saying i can't make another step
[1:10:38] i'm tired of living this way i'm tired
[1:10:41] of going on this way
[1:10:42] i hope you're hearing me now don't just
[1:10:45] leave this for people who have not come
[1:10:47] into christ
[1:10:47] but that's for every one of our lives if
[1:10:49] there's anything where the enemy
[1:10:51] has tried to vet you or put anything
[1:10:53] upon your life
[1:10:54] you've got to come to a place to say i'm
[1:10:57] tired of this
[1:11:02] hallelujah and this is the rest
[1:11:06] the rest wherewith you may cause the
[1:11:10] weary
[1:11:11] to rest the faint be exhausted
[1:11:16] it's like trying to
[1:11:20] save somebody who's drowning one time in
[1:11:22] the swimming pool i almost drowned i
[1:11:23] didn't realize i
[1:11:24] you know they one of the first times i
[1:11:26] went swimming and
[1:11:28] i was out at my uh mamaw browning's
[1:11:30] house down there in salina and
[1:11:32] you know i've been going around the pool
[1:11:35] on the float and i was only four foot
[1:11:36] pools but
[1:11:37] you know i was shorter than four foot at
[1:11:39] the time
[1:11:40] and i remember when i jumped out there
[1:11:43] and one of the
[1:11:44] one of the young boys he pulled that
[1:11:46] that float away and
[1:11:47] well i went i wasn't i wasn't coming up
[1:11:53] i remember all the you know it was just
[1:11:54] a scare it was a things but everything
[1:11:56] took place so quick and then i remember
[1:11:58] when they
[1:11:58] pulled me up out of that water and got
[1:12:00] me over there on the side and
[1:12:02] and you know but many times you hear
[1:12:05] when people are drowning
[1:12:06] sometimes people they're fighting
[1:12:09] i mean they're fighting when they're
[1:12:11] drowning they're trying to
[1:12:14] and somebody has to tell them calm down
[1:12:17] just do what i tell you to do
[1:12:22] i mean when they're trying to help you
[1:12:23] it seems like you're still going down
[1:12:26] but if you just rest and you just
[1:12:30] trust them they'll get you to safety
[1:12:34] that's the same way that jesus does it
[1:12:38] all right blood picks it up and he says
[1:12:41] here it is prophesied right here in
[1:12:43] isaiah and it came to pass about 700
[1:12:45] years later at pentecost when they were
[1:12:47] all filled
[1:12:48] with the holy ghost exactly as they said
[1:12:50] it would be
[1:12:51] this is the true sabbath that was
[1:12:54] promised
[1:12:55] thus when they were filled with the holy
[1:12:57] ghost they ceased from their worldly
[1:12:59] works
[1:13:00] their worldly doings their evil ways and
[1:13:03] the holy ghost took
[1:13:04] charge of their lives they entered into
[1:13:07] rest
[1:13:08] there is your rest that is your sabbath
[1:13:10] it's not a day
[1:13:12] it's not a year but the eternity
[1:13:15] of being filled and blessed in the holy
[1:13:18] spirit
[1:13:18] it is you ceasing and god
[1:13:22] doing it is god in you willing and doing
[1:13:25] of his own good
[1:13:26] pleasure
[1:13:31] so we recognize that within it as we
[1:13:34] are looking at it that the rest itself
[1:13:37] is speaking of the true
[1:13:39] baptism of the holy ghost it comes with
[1:13:42] the resurrection power
[1:13:44] to bring full deliverance in a life
[1:13:48] to bring a translating from death unto
[1:13:51] life
[1:13:52] from darkness into light amen
[1:13:55] it is it is god's power moving
[1:13:59] upon that life and that individual it's
[1:14:01] where all things
[1:14:02] pass away the old man dies
[1:14:06] and you cease from your worldly works
[1:14:08] it's the creation of
[1:14:10] god taking place within you
[1:14:14] you know when jesus here as it speaks in
[1:14:17] the book of revelations he said
[1:14:19] behold i make all things anew
[1:14:22] there's no way you and i cannot make
[1:14:24] ourselves anew
[1:14:26] we can try to patch ourselves up and
[1:14:28] we'll have to stop doing this or quit
[1:14:30] doing that
[1:14:30] but it it wasn't what we could do
[1:14:34] it wasn't that we laid around limp but
[1:14:37] it we recognize
[1:14:38] that it's not no more else getting our
[1:14:40] eyes on ourselves
[1:14:42] but it's recognizing of the one who is
[1:14:44] dealing with our lives
[1:14:46] standing in our midst that he's the one
[1:14:48] that said behold
[1:14:49] i will make all things anew
[1:14:53] it's his working so this rest remembers
[1:14:58] we're looking at because i know some of
[1:14:59] you have
[1:15:00] connections and you know we know the
[1:15:02] seventh day and or or
[1:15:04] jehovah witness and we have all these
[1:15:06] different ones you have you know
[1:15:07] sabbatarians and
[1:15:08] seventh-day adventists and different
[1:15:10] ones and they want to hang on to that
[1:15:12] seventh day not recognizing that that
[1:15:15] was a
[1:15:15] type it was a type that was given to a
[1:15:18] specific group of people
[1:15:20] the israelites it was that which god
[1:15:23] had told them you are to set aside the
[1:15:26] seventh day
[1:15:27] it's to be a sign between me and you
[1:15:30] and what it was god provided all they
[1:15:32] had need of
[1:15:33] within the six days they didn't have to
[1:15:35] labor on the seventh day
[1:15:37] and they were able to observe that rest
[1:15:40] uh at that time
[1:15:42] and we wrote that was only that was only
[1:15:44] a type
[1:15:45] god was showing that it was it was to
[1:15:47] show a memorial
[1:15:49] of what god had done there in creation
[1:15:52] he
[1:15:52] entered into his rest the works of god
[1:15:55] being finished
[1:15:56] there on the seventh day it was only a
[1:15:59] time it was only a shadow to
[1:16:02] show that indeed there would come
[1:16:06] indeed a place there would be a land
[1:16:09] that would be
[1:16:10] provided and made available there would
[1:16:13] be a
[1:16:13] people there would be a day that that
[1:16:17] there would be a people that would
[1:16:18] really come
[1:16:19] into a rest not just one day out of the
[1:16:22] week
[1:16:22] but would really come into a rest where
[1:16:24] you enter into this
[1:16:26] rest of the holy ghost the person of
[1:16:28] jesus christ
[1:16:29] and you're never going out anymore the
[1:16:32] the things of the world
[1:16:33] have passed away amen amen
[1:16:37] amen this rest
[1:16:40] that we're talking about which this is
[1:16:42] the holy ghost
[1:16:43] this rest is your inheritance
[1:16:48] it's the inheritance that jesus came
[1:16:51] to bring us to
[1:16:54] remember our inheritance was given to us
[1:16:58] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:01] hallelujah and jesus came god
[1:17:05] came down and it became flesh in order
[1:17:08] to bring us to our inheritance i just
[1:17:11] want you to follow me now
[1:17:12] he came he became flesh he took the
[1:17:16] word upon himself
[1:17:19] that he might pay the price and that he
[1:17:23] might lead us into our inheritance
[1:17:28] after he had raised when he appeared to
[1:17:30] them
[1:17:31] he spoke to them letting know the
[1:17:34] scriptures the word
[1:17:35] that had been fulfilled and then the
[1:17:38] word
[1:17:38] that had been fulfilled revealed and
[1:17:41] vindicated in that hour
[1:17:43] he told them go wait in jerusalem
[1:17:47] until you are endued with power
[1:17:50] from on high it wasn't enough that they
[1:17:53] knew the revelation
[1:17:55] yes amen they had to knew the author of
[1:17:58] the book
[1:18:00] amen the same god that fulfilled it
[1:18:02] through the body of jesus christ
[1:18:05] he was gonna continue his work through a
[1:18:08] many member body
[1:18:09] it would no longer it wouldn't be
[1:18:11] peter's strength it wouldn't be
[1:18:13] paul's strength it wouldn't be andrew's
[1:18:15] strength
[1:18:16] it would be the strength of almighty god
[1:18:19] fulfilling his word through their lives
[1:18:23] so much so that they took knowledge that
[1:18:26] peter
[1:18:27] and james they were ignorant but the
[1:18:29] bible says they took
[1:18:30] knowledge they had been with jesus
[1:18:36] it wasn't because they carried the
[1:18:38] scrolls like jesus
[1:18:41] come on now it wasn't because they had
[1:18:43] the same button belt buckle are you with
[1:18:45] me
[1:18:45] it was because the life the expression
[1:18:49] the image that had been reflected
[1:18:51] through the life
[1:18:52] of the messiah was now reflected
[1:18:55] through the messiahs
[1:19:09] it came like joshua to bring us into
[1:19:12] that place
[1:19:16] it's our position
[1:19:20] this rest is our position
[1:19:24] it's where the things that god has
[1:19:26] placed
[1:19:27] listen every seed if you take an apple
[1:19:30] tree
[1:19:31] every leaf every fruit all
[1:19:34] that will ever be is in it right then
[1:19:38] it looks real small but it's already in
[1:19:42] it
[1:19:43] what does it have to do it has to get
[1:19:45] planted
[1:19:48] and this is why when the holy ghost has
[1:19:51] come
[1:19:52] it's the holy ghost that brings a real
[1:19:55] planting in our life
[1:19:57] he releases that germ that's there
[1:20:00] in that seed on the inside every leaf
[1:20:04] every piece of fruit all those things it
[1:20:06] all begins to come out
[1:20:07] in his time in his season in his
[1:20:10] presence
[1:20:13] it's him it's getting in that position
[1:20:21] it's your place of authority
[1:20:25] they did not when they were in the
[1:20:26] wilderness in their journey
[1:20:28] that was not their position that was not
[1:20:31] the place of authority
[1:20:32] but they were going somewhere hallelujah
[1:20:35] are you with me
[1:20:36] so you're here this morning you just get
[1:20:38] it set in your heart i'm going somewhere
[1:20:41] i'm not just here rambling around
[1:20:44] there's a clear vision that's set before
[1:20:46] me i'm not just here taking up space
[1:20:48] i'm going somewhere amen
[1:20:51] hallelujah i've got a purpose for being
[1:20:53] here this morning i've got a purpose
[1:20:56] in everything that i'm going somewhere
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:05] it's the place of adoption and spiritual
[1:21:08] blessings
[1:21:11] and that is that is only
[1:21:15] in jesus christ
[1:21:18] isaiah 11 10 it says in that day
[1:21:23] there shall be a root of jesse
[1:21:27] which shall stand for an ensign
[1:21:32] of the people to it
[1:21:35] shall the gentiles seek
[1:21:39] and his rest shall be glorious
[1:21:46] amen the root of jesse
[1:21:49] he what's which is before
[1:21:53] before all things
[1:21:57] by whom all things consist
[1:22:01] he which was before and he he alone
[1:22:06] there will be the end sign and the word
[1:22:09] ensign
[1:22:10] means that of the standard it's a
[1:22:12] rallying point
[1:22:14] no doubt many of us you know we've seen
[1:22:16] these banners or you've seen
[1:22:18] flags where you know uh different ones
[1:22:22] uh
[1:22:22] you know brother carlos you're familiar
[1:22:23] with that and there were brothers who
[1:22:25] were in the arm of forces brother dave
[1:22:27] you had one over your battalion or you
[1:22:30] know when those are in the civil war if
[1:22:32] we
[1:22:32] look back into that or or you know and
[1:22:34] and a revolutionary war
[1:22:37] and we look at it that that's that flag
[1:22:39] they had what they called
[1:22:40] a flag bearer the flag bearer did not
[1:22:44] necessarily carry a gun
[1:22:46] but he had an important duty and that
[1:22:49] was to carry
[1:22:50] the flag where the flag was at that's
[1:22:53] where the leader was at
[1:22:57] when the battle got hot and happy and
[1:23:00] and pressures were coming
[1:23:01] and they were fighting they had received
[1:23:03] orders right here is where we want you
[1:23:05] to launch the attack but you know
[1:23:07] sometimes
[1:23:08] in the midst of battle you can get kind
[1:23:10] of turned around
[1:23:11] and you kind of lose your bearings
[1:23:13] because you're so locked in on that
[1:23:15] of the battle but you know there would
[1:23:17] be a flag
[1:23:18] of your uh platoon or battalion that
[1:23:22] would be lifted up
[1:23:23] in your eyes oh help me preach now it
[1:23:26] would do you no good to look at your
[1:23:28] feet
[1:23:28] you had to lift up your head you had to
[1:23:31] look
[1:23:32] for that flag because there was somebody
[1:23:34] who was holding that flag
[1:23:36] and that flag was a rallying point where
[1:23:39] they could see
[1:23:40] that flag was raised high it was
[1:23:42] something about it that would give
[1:23:44] courage in those men to know our flag is
[1:23:48] going on
[1:23:48] let me just tell you something when the
[1:23:50] devil tried to take away
[1:23:53] the flag the life of jesus christ the
[1:23:56] name of jesus christ
[1:23:57] from the church of the living god god in
[1:24:00] this
[1:24:00] hour as he had promised he sent that
[1:24:04] of his word in this hour that god
[1:24:06] through the prophet
[1:24:08] would hold up that standard of the flag
[1:24:10] when you and i
[1:24:11] didn't know where to go what is right
[1:24:14] where do we go
[1:24:14] there who was exalted jesus christ
[1:24:18] and that's why this morning he is still
[1:24:21] exalted in his church he said if i
[1:24:30] be lifted up i will draw men
[1:24:34] unto me
[1:24:54] it's a living word of god
[1:24:58] the person of jesus christ
[1:25:03] that young man but brother brown talks
[1:25:06] about that french soldier
[1:25:08] he was on a train right right
[1:25:18] they had sent letters to their parents
[1:25:23] can anybody claim you know can they
[1:25:26] claim different
[1:25:27] is one of your sons here hallelujah
[1:25:38] these boys had amnesia
[1:25:41] the war had shocked them
[1:25:46] let me just say this to you those that
[1:25:48] have been in war and different things
[1:25:50] and seen sometimes it's not even war
[1:25:52] sometimes people have seen things in
[1:25:53] life
[1:25:55] a body or whatever more you weren't
[1:25:56] meant to see that right
[1:25:59] you weren't meant to see that you
[1:26:00] remember that from that training they
[1:26:01] told you you're somewhere you got to try
[1:26:02] to flip flip the switch in your mind
[1:26:05] we're not meant to see that all right
[1:26:07] are you with me
[1:26:09] but to think the shock of war let me
[1:26:10] just tell you something one of the
[1:26:12] greatest shocks that's greater than any
[1:26:13] shock of war
[1:26:14] was the shock of sin
[1:26:19] because it was through that fall that
[1:26:21] man forgot
[1:26:23] who he was
[1:26:27] he didn't know who he was
[1:26:30] but in that time when that stop was made
[1:26:32] there
[1:26:34] they noticed that boy got off that train
[1:26:36] when he got off the train
[1:26:39] the guy who's the guard you know you got
[1:26:40] to watch him
[1:26:42] he got to noticing when this boy got off
[1:26:45] the train
[1:26:46] he started looking around hallelujah
[1:26:51] and he noticed as he looked around he
[1:26:52] thought i'm just going to follow him see
[1:26:53] where he goes
[1:26:55] that that boy he started walking
[1:26:58] and so that that man began to follow him
[1:27:01] what he found was
[1:27:02] filed him up a little hill down this
[1:27:04] little path
[1:27:07] and he said he came and he said when he
[1:27:09] got up there
[1:27:11] he said he noticed here come this old
[1:27:13] man running out on a porch
[1:27:16] and he said my son
[1:27:22] they told me you were dead but i knew
[1:27:25] you'd come back home
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:31] what was it that that man saw he saw
[1:27:34] something that was familiar
[1:27:36] brother said it was a water tower
[1:27:42] this is why there's only there's one
[1:27:44] water power
[1:27:45] there's one reality there's one person
[1:27:48] that is to be exalted that can bring
[1:27:51] sons
[1:27:52] back home and that is jesus christ
[1:27:57] amen that's what the word of god
[1:28:00] does it reveals jesus christ not to be a
[1:28:03] creed
[1:28:04] not to be a dogma but to be the living
[1:28:07] god
[1:28:08] it is the pathway back home
[1:28:11] it's what sons and daughters say that's
[1:28:14] what i've been longing for
[1:28:29] he might have had a train ticket to the
[1:28:30] asylum but it wasn't fulfilled
[1:28:33] amen hallelujah
[1:28:36] his train ride was interrupted
[1:28:41] help me preach now amen many of our
[1:28:44] lives we can go right through here
[1:28:46] we were on train rides you might be on a
[1:28:48] train ride this morning
[1:28:50] but the same one that interrupted a pair
[1:28:53] by revealing himself
[1:28:54] is the same one that comes and he
[1:28:56] interrupts
[1:28:58] our lives
[1:29:05] hallelujah the same god that will
[1:29:07] interrupt nature under the sixth seal
[1:29:09] is the same god that interrupts the
[1:29:11] course of nature
[1:29:12] in our lives by what by the word
[1:29:16] amen hallelujah
[1:29:20] glory be to god in the highest amen this
[1:29:23] is why he
[1:29:24] is our portion amen
[1:29:30] that's why paul in hebrews 4 he would
[1:29:32] exhort the believer
[1:29:34] to be diligent to enter into his rest
[1:29:37] labor he uses the word labor is to be
[1:29:39] diligent to to let
[1:29:40] enter in to that rest
[1:29:44] which is to be birthed into the word of
[1:29:46] the living god
[1:29:48] amen it's where we we in the word become
[1:29:51] one
[1:29:52] i want you to look at this here in
[1:29:54] hebrews 12 1
[1:29:58] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:30:01] about
[1:30:02] was so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:30:06] let us lay aside every weight
[1:30:10] and the sin which death so easily
[1:30:14] beset us and let us run with patience
[1:30:17] the race that is set before us how
[1:30:20] they're going to do that
[1:30:22] looking unto jesus amen
[1:30:25] amen simple but what you got to lay
[1:30:29] aside
[1:30:30] look to him he gives you strength to lay
[1:30:33] it aside
[1:30:34] quit looking at it lay it aside
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:42] looking unto jesus help me read this
[1:30:45] next part
[1:30:47] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:30:51] who's the author of your faith jesus
[1:30:53] amen
[1:30:54] who's the finisher of your faith jesus
[1:30:59] glory be to god hallelujah who
[1:31:02] for the joy that was set before him
[1:31:05] endured
[1:31:05] the cross despising the shame
[1:31:09] and it sat down at the right hand of the
[1:31:11] throne of god let me just tell you
[1:31:12] something
[1:31:13] this speaks of our life as believers to
[1:31:15] catch a vision of that word
[1:31:17] oh it's true before our lives were
[1:31:20] surrendered to god anybody remember
[1:31:22] when god first lifted the load of sin
[1:31:24] from your life
[1:31:25] all hell was turned against you you
[1:31:27] begin to have everybody
[1:31:29] saying everything against you paul said
[1:31:31] you endured a great flight
[1:31:33] of afflictions but the bible says in
[1:31:36] isaiah 63 9
[1:31:38] he said in all of their afflictions he
[1:31:41] was afflicted
[1:31:42] and he saved them by the angel of his
[1:31:45] presence let me just tell you something
[1:31:47] you're not in this alone
[1:31:51] with god brought him out of egypt he was
[1:31:54] there
[1:31:54] with them
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:05] this is why no matter what the skeptics
[1:32:08] and scoffers and
[1:32:09] everything else to come around your life
[1:32:11] you can say i'm going somewhere
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:16] i don't delight in being ridiculed or
[1:32:19] this or that nobody does
[1:32:20] but you see there's a vision that's set
[1:32:23] before you
[1:32:24] there's a promise that you know that
[1:32:26] it's not just a promise of god
[1:32:28] but it's your promise and god is calling
[1:32:31] you
[1:32:32] into that promise if you'll just look
[1:32:34] unto him
[1:32:35] because he is that promise
[1:32:47] for consider him that endured
[1:32:51] you catching those words endured
[1:32:56] hallelujah such contradiction
[1:32:59] of sinners against himself
[1:33:03] lest you be weary and faint in your
[1:33:04] minds listen jesus didn't only have the
[1:33:06] devils telling him
[1:33:08] if you're the son of god do this if
[1:33:10] you're the son of god do this
[1:33:12] then his brethren john 7. no man to have
[1:33:15] gift like this just sits around and
[1:33:16] don't show it publicly
[1:33:19] then he had that of the religion said
[1:33:21] you know what you got a black mark on
[1:33:23] your life
[1:33:25] you ain't who you say you are
[1:33:29] you're a drunken roman soldier son
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:33] but jesus knew who he was
[1:33:37] amen i know this is very simple but the
[1:33:40] devil
[1:33:41] doesn't hold the mystery of your life
[1:33:46] all he remembers is that snare that
[1:33:49] entanglement
[1:33:50] and the life that was there he doesn't
[1:33:53] know
[1:33:53] that there's a real son and daughter of
[1:33:56] god on the inside
[1:34:00] thank you that's good amen
[1:34:11] look at somebody next to you and say lay
[1:34:13] it aside
[1:34:23] remember the son of man is the lord of
[1:34:26] the sabbath
[1:34:28] amen the son of man is the word
[1:34:31] made flesh
[1:34:34] it's god's word a promise that he made
[1:34:38] that is now taken upon flesh
[1:34:45] malachi 4 has come and gone
[1:34:48] amen brother branham had his part god
[1:34:51] had his part
[1:34:52] brother branham had his part and now
[1:34:54] that the messenger is passed off the
[1:34:56] scene
[1:34:57] that same god is fulfilling the word
[1:35:00] that he made real and the promise to you
[1:35:03] and i
[1:35:03] in this generation it's the same god
[1:35:06] who is present bringing his word to pass
[1:35:11] hallelujah amen they can say everything
[1:35:14] they want to say
[1:35:15] about this message but i'm living proof
[1:35:18] of it brother
[1:35:22] i needed this message this message
[1:35:25] ain't books and tights it's jesus christ
[1:35:32] i needed this a church couldn't do it
[1:35:35] i needed this message
[1:35:47] sometimes some of the nonsense i've
[1:35:48] heard where people say well we've got to
[1:35:50] get people to christ first
[1:35:51] how in the world do you get people to
[1:35:53] christ
[1:35:55] the message is not theology like well
[1:35:58] once you get to jesus
[1:35:59] then you know then we'll give you the
[1:36:01] message how do you know
[1:36:03] who he is unless he has been revealed to
[1:36:06] you
[1:36:07] in this hour that's a lie from the pits
[1:36:11] of hell
[1:36:12] it's satan's intent to try to take
[1:36:15] people
[1:36:15] away from a living reality the message
[1:36:18] of the
[1:36:19] hour reveals him to be the same
[1:36:22] yesterday
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:34] he is the inside that's been lifted up
[1:36:37] amen
[1:36:42] he's the rallying point amen
[1:36:45] hallelujah but the man told us he said
[1:36:47] i'm not god's gift he said the holy
[1:36:49] ghost is god's gift
[1:36:53] god used flesh
[1:36:57] come on that's saying listen to me don't
[1:36:59] put that back there on the prophet
[1:37:00] that same god is using your flesh
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:04] when brother adam talked about applying
[1:37:06] the token for your house he said
[1:37:08] let him see it in you
[1:37:13] glory amen but one catch on the tape
[1:37:16] won't catch them but a living reality of
[1:37:18] jesus christ
[1:37:19] in your life what's it like it's like
[1:37:21] the water tower
[1:37:25] listen you don't know where my kids are
[1:37:27] at they're out doing all this and doing
[1:37:28] all that but yeah when they get sick

[1:37:33] tell me now when everything starts going
[1:37:36] wrong you got family members and water
[1:37:37] more
[1:37:37] why don't they go and take it to their
[1:37:38] church i'm not saying that sarcastically
[1:37:41] you want to know why
[1:37:42] because they know what they're at is a
[1:37:44] social club
[1:37:47] they know there ain't no power there
[1:37:50] let's just say it let's just say like it
[1:37:51] is
[1:37:52] they know there ain't no power there
[1:37:53] they know there ain't no authority there
[1:37:56] i'm gonna go ahead and preach in hell
[1:37:58] when god when the chastening
[1:38:00] and the trying of job was over god not
[1:38:03] only
[1:38:03] had to wear that that that repression
[1:38:06] was lifted from job when he could pray
[1:38:08] for his friends
[1:38:09] but when god was able to stand there and
[1:38:12] rebuke those men build that and life
[1:38:14] fast and different ones
[1:38:15] he said now you go get an offering and
[1:38:17] offer it up and you come to job
[1:38:19] and you let job pray for you
[1:38:24] when abamelec was getting ready to take
[1:38:26] sarah
[1:38:28] it didn't change that abraham was still
[1:38:31] his prophet
[1:38:33] you might look at yourself and say they
[1:38:35] would come to me they're not trusting in
[1:38:37] your flesh
[1:38:38] but they know there's a living god
[1:38:41] that's there
[1:38:41] it's not your work it's a living
[1:38:44] presence
[1:38:44] of a living god
[1:38:48] there's a great storm outside sunny
[1:38:50] we're christian
[1:38:51] but mama in a storm like this
[1:38:54] i want a god with skin
[1:38:57] [Applause]

[1:39:19] else in the world brother saying i
[1:39:20] didn't do this and
[1:39:21] i didn't do that i was raised in a in a
[1:39:23] message church
[1:39:24] but god had to get that old meanness of
[1:39:26] pride amen
[1:39:29] that old goody two shoes like your own
[1:39:31] righteousness did something for you
[1:39:33] god had to let you know you needed the
[1:39:36] grace of god just as much as the
[1:39:37] drunkard or the dope addict or the
[1:39:40] prostitute
[1:39:41] got it let you know you need my grace
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:50] there's a need remember we were looking
[1:39:53] at this about the sabbath day
[1:39:54] there's a need amen they were wanting to
[1:39:58] accuse jesus
[1:39:59] of all these things all your disciples
[1:40:00] put corn on the sabbath day
[1:40:02] you're healing people on the sabbath day
[1:40:04] ah they're getting up and taking up
[1:40:05] their bed and walking
[1:40:09] they failed to recognize what was being
[1:40:13] done
[1:40:14] was not the own works of the people
[1:40:18] there was a need in their life and the
[1:40:22] son of man
[1:40:23] the word he who gave the sabbath
[1:40:27] was there to release burdens on the
[1:40:30] sabbath
[1:40:32] amen what were the people doing
[1:40:36] when he said rise up take up that bed
[1:40:38] and walk
[1:40:39] it was not their work
[1:40:43] he won their work what was happening
[1:40:47] they were tapping in to the vision of
[1:40:50] the word
[1:40:51] brother let me just say like this don't
[1:40:53] don't try to put it out there just stay
[1:40:54] with me now don't try to put it out
[1:40:56] there
[1:40:57] it ain't something far out there or some
[1:40:59] mysticism it was the simplicity
[1:41:01] where they were dialed into the word and
[1:41:04] the word just took a hold of their
[1:41:06] life and and they forgot all of their
[1:41:08] doubts and unbelief he was cast out
[1:41:10] and what did they do they oh they obeyed
[1:41:14] the word
[1:41:15] and they rose up and they walked amen
[1:41:19] remember they wanted to accuse jesus
[1:41:22] and jesus response was the father
[1:41:25] worketh
[1:41:25] and i work hitherto amen what i see the
[1:41:29] son do what i see the father doing
[1:41:31] that doeth the son likewise
[1:41:35] they were looking at everything in works
[1:41:38] based but what they failed to recognize
[1:41:41] that it
[1:41:42] is god revealing himself that
[1:41:45] actually is to set the works in motion
[1:41:49] and the works are not not that of where
[1:41:51] we're trying to do something
[1:41:53] it is yielding in obedience to his
[1:41:56] voice it's just as simple as the as
[1:42:00] the ox gold was laying there god got
[1:42:03] directed shamgar at that moment
[1:42:04] shamgar didn't have time to go get you
[1:42:06] know britannica encyclopedia and
[1:42:08] look it up and say well i wonder how
[1:42:09] this will work he'd have time for that
[1:42:14] inspiration comes not for you and i have
[1:42:17] to explain it
[1:42:18] inspiration comes to put us
[1:42:21] in motion
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:25] so brother brown would tell us over and
[1:42:26] over he said obey the pulsation of the
[1:42:29] holy ghost
[1:42:31] amen
[1:42:34] sometimes the very things you can think
[1:42:36] are silly is the very thing god
[1:42:37] it will use
[1:42:43] the bible tells us here in luke 5 5
[1:42:48] it speaks you you younger submit
[1:42:49] yourselves unto the elder yea
[1:42:51] all of you be subject one to another and
[1:42:52] be clothed with humility
[1:42:54] for god resisteth the proud and giveth
[1:42:56] grace to the humble
[1:42:58] how many say help me lord amen
[1:43:01] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:43:04] mighty
[1:43:04] hand of god remember in his power
[1:43:08] in his right in his right hand in the
[1:43:10] mighty hand of god
[1:43:11] there is power amen there is blessing
[1:43:14] this is where the seven stars come from
[1:43:17] or the power of the god has
[1:43:19] behind it everything all that he is the
[1:43:21] bible says they got not the land by
[1:43:23] their
[1:43:24] own sword but they got it by thy right
[1:43:26] arm
[1:43:27] and thy right hand
[1:43:31] humble yourselves under the mighty hand
[1:43:33] of god humble yourselves
[1:43:35] under come under the mighty hand of god
[1:43:39] remember when it was time for the rain
[1:43:42] to come
[1:43:43] the god had spoke through elijah when he
[1:43:46] sent his servant on the mountain
[1:43:48] remember the response was he said i see
[1:43:51] a cloud
[1:43:52] and the cloud is like that of a man's
[1:43:55] hand
[1:43:57] are you with me it was a man's hand when
[1:44:00] when elisha
[1:44:01] was all distraught i mean he was upset
[1:44:05] man
[1:44:06] you know he you know jehoshaphat and
[1:44:08] them had asked for him
[1:44:09] and uh uh the king you know that was
[1:44:12] there at that time and then king i think
[1:44:13] was ahab but
[1:44:14] if i'm not mistaken uh he they were
[1:44:17] there
[1:44:17] remember elisha comes up there and said
[1:44:20] if it wasn't for jehoshaphat i wouldn't
[1:44:23] even be
[1:44:28] such love i wouldn't even be here
[1:44:32] but what happened a minstrel came and
[1:44:35] the bible says the hand of the lord
[1:44:37] came upon him amen
[1:44:41] god's delivering hand has come upon
[1:44:44] this generation
[1:44:49] his word his word his presence
[1:44:52] notice why that he might exalt you in
[1:44:55] due time
[1:44:56] casting all your care all your anxieties
[1:45:01] all your worries all your worries all
[1:45:03] your frustrations
[1:45:05] casting them
[1:45:09] casting them casting all your cares
[1:45:12] all your burdens cast them on him
[1:45:16] because he cares for you
[1:45:23] no doubt every one of us you've heard
[1:45:25] this
[1:45:28] i guess we say it's an old proverb
[1:45:30] brother branham called it a god
[1:45:31] dishonoring proverb
[1:45:35] brethren said that gold god dishonoring
[1:45:37] proverb is god helps those who help
[1:45:39] themselves
[1:45:41] remember bran said how ridiculous god
[1:45:43] helps those who can't
[1:45:45] help themselves
[1:45:50] remember it was a pharisees and that day
[1:45:53] they were righteous jesus said
[1:45:56] they who are well don't need a physician
[1:46:00] but there were others who needed a
[1:46:02] physician
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:04] they needed healing amen
[1:46:07] you're in a good place this morning
[1:46:10] satan's power is limited
[1:46:12] god's power isn't limited
[1:46:15] god's power is not limited it's the same
[1:46:18] power of god that brought the trees
[1:46:20] brought the flowers brought this earth
[1:46:22] the same
[1:46:23] power of god it's the same power of god
[1:46:26] that has led you
[1:46:27] to where you're at this morning i mean
[1:46:31] who in the world goes and tells the
[1:46:32] geese
[1:46:33] hey y'all get ready you know hey you
[1:46:35] know they're getting ready for you down
[1:46:36] louisiana and you know the rice patty
[1:46:38] hey you know you've got to be getting
[1:46:39] man look at it i mean
[1:46:40] you know the weather forecast over here
[1:46:41] you guys are getting together
[1:46:43] they don't need that right
[1:46:46] the ducks don't need our help the birds
[1:46:48] don't need our help
[1:46:50] [Applause]
[1:46:53] there amen an instinct and i like how
[1:46:55] brother branham said it
[1:46:56] he said science calls it instinct but i
[1:46:59] call it god
[1:47:04] who is it that tells them of the great
[1:47:06] herbs of the caribou
[1:47:08] and other things who tells the salmon
[1:47:10] it's time to migrate
[1:47:12] it's time to get back to the homeland
[1:47:14] it's time to get back to the bedding
[1:47:17] grounds
[1:47:17] who is it it is the power of god
[1:47:20] that speaks to their heart brother they
[1:47:23] don't try to fight it
[1:47:24] they just obey it
[1:47:30] on the way back yeah there's many that
[1:47:32] die but brother
[1:47:34] those that die they're on their way back
[1:47:36] they're headed
[1:47:37] in the right direction amen
[1:47:45] he's made a way he's made a way
[1:47:49] he is that way amen many times
[1:47:54] what keeps the blessings of god away
[1:47:58] is a lack of true repentance
[1:48:05] which is a true confession
[1:48:09] the angel of the lord told the prophet
[1:48:11] he was so burdened
[1:48:12] and he told the prophet he said before
[1:48:14] them people come in the prayer line
[1:48:15] brethren preaches this and he that's in
[1:48:17] you
[1:48:18] when they come in that prayer line he
[1:48:20] said you have them
[1:48:21] before they get in there have them
[1:48:23] confess their wrongs
[1:48:25] you know what why repentance and
[1:48:26] confession it is goes hand in hand
[1:48:29] because what god has brought conviction
[1:48:31] in your life
[1:48:32] it's the word right when the word listen
[1:48:35] uh
[1:48:36] just the word alone won't do that it has
[1:48:38] to be the living word
[1:48:40] to bring conviction in that life and
[1:48:42] don't just write it off of well you know
[1:48:44] this is just some little habit call it a
[1:48:46] devil
[1:48:48] identify what it is call it what it is
[1:48:52] and say god i'm wrong i need deliverance
[1:48:56] i need help amen
[1:48:59] well this is something i'll carry with
[1:49:00] me you know all along you know my family
[1:49:02] had it my
[1:49:03] son and my dad had it quit glorifying
[1:49:05] the devil
[1:49:08] look to the other family tree
[1:49:12] a natural tree it got a lot of strings
[1:49:15] in it
[1:49:15] all right oh i know everybody likes to
[1:49:17] look at their family tree
[1:49:19] like their family tree is the ultimate
[1:49:20] it's as rotten as cankered as everything
[1:49:23] else
[1:49:23] i know there's good people and
[1:49:25] everything else but let me tell you
[1:49:26] something it don't matter
[1:49:27] what you think about your tree there is
[1:49:29] one tree
[1:49:30] that is truly the tree of life and that
[1:49:33] is
[1:49:34] jesus christ
[1:49:42] well how do i get that cry out to him
[1:49:47] amen he is your help
[1:49:51] he'll do for you what's impossible
[1:49:54] amen can i have just a few more moments
[1:50:02] we only have one service today we might
[1:50:05] as well make it two in one
[1:50:11] remember jesus what he told
[1:50:15] many of the disciples who were following
[1:50:17] him at the time he
[1:50:19] the 70 and many he looked at him and he
[1:50:22] said if you'll continue
[1:50:24] in my word
[1:50:27] ye shall be my disciples indeed
[1:50:31] he told them you're going you'll know
[1:50:32] the truth you shall know the truth
[1:50:36] and the truth shall make you free
[1:50:39] even talking about some truth he wasn't
[1:50:41] talking about a letter
[1:50:44] these are people who knew that the law
[1:50:47] the prophets the psalms the writings
[1:50:49] they knew
[1:50:50] it was the truth there were many that
[1:50:54] looked at him
[1:50:55] and said truly
[1:50:59] but he wasn't just talking about what
[1:51:00] they could see
[1:51:02] he was talking about they would have a
[1:51:05] personal experience
[1:51:09] with the truth which is
[1:51:12] him the word the holy ghost
[1:51:17] the spirit of truth brings out the truth
[1:51:20] of who you really are the spirit of
[1:51:23] truth
[1:51:24] reveals the seals it takes the seals off
[1:51:27] of your life
[1:51:28] it pushes back the darkness of your life
[1:51:31] what does that
[1:51:32] the spirit of truth
[1:51:35] he said i am the truth the way
[1:51:39] and the life
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:43] what did he say continue yes amen
[1:51:50] here's what they said we're abraham's
[1:51:52] seed
[1:51:54] we ain't never been in bondage
[1:51:57] what a sad sad lie that the devil had
[1:52:00] told them
[1:52:03] they thought they were free they didn't
[1:52:06] realize
[1:52:07] go on the outside remember on the listen
[1:52:09] to me now
[1:52:10] on the outside everything
[1:52:14] was pristine
[1:52:19] it would seem all on the outside oh my
[1:52:23] this is the real token everything's just
[1:52:26] so perfect
[1:52:27] so and so so perfect brother so and so
[1:52:29] so perfect
[1:52:30] look at how everything is it's just
[1:52:33] right it's one inch from the floor
[1:52:35] listen i believe the real holy ghost on
[1:52:37] the inside of a person
[1:52:39] either reflect itself to the outside
[1:52:46] but there but there is a holiness there
[1:52:49] is a holiness
[1:52:50] of the holy ghost that produces a holy
[1:52:53] dress
[1:52:54] are you with me it produces a holiness
[1:52:57] of heart and life and spirit
[1:52:59] all right are you with me amen i mean
[1:53:02] you know what i mean you can you can
[1:53:03] take people who have long hair and wear
[1:53:04] a long dress and one or more they're
[1:53:05] mean as a snake
[1:53:08] they can look the part in everything
[1:53:09] else and strip you down and cut you out
[1:53:11] and dice you out and everything else
[1:53:14] that ain't the holy ghost amen
[1:53:17] i need the holy ghost as much as people
[1:53:19] want to rip down with emotion
[1:53:20] and this and then that is that's true
[1:53:22] and the plum line also says
[1:53:24] that you can have the brandon will say
[1:53:26] just like this you can have he said the
[1:53:28] long hair
[1:53:28] and the long dressers and they've got
[1:53:30] tempers to fight blood sauce
[1:53:33] tongues that are longer than their hair
[1:53:35] well my my mama
[1:53:37] go ahead what are you talking about i'm
[1:53:40] talking about
[1:53:41] when the life of jesus christ it comes
[1:53:44] on the inside
[1:53:44] it produces a character of his life
[1:53:49] it changes your desires you want to walk
[1:53:52] pleasing to him
[1:53:53] that's why your dress changes your
[1:53:55] attitude changes
[1:53:57] and you find as things go on in your
[1:53:59] life little things you might be inclined
[1:54:01] in this area he's working in your life
[1:54:04] and you find things
[1:54:05] in your life just fleeing away what's
[1:54:08] happening
[1:54:08] you're aligning with the word that
[1:54:10] you're united with
[1:54:12] and satan's holds
[1:54:16] being removed
[1:54:21] that's why jesus said whosoever
[1:54:23] committed sin practicer
[1:54:25] is a servant of sin brought in bondage
[1:54:28] to it
[1:54:29] the servant abideth not in the house
[1:54:31] forever but the son abideth forever
[1:54:32] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:54:35] ye shall be free
[1:54:37] indeed
[1:54:48] when jesus stood here
[1:54:51] remember what was delivered to him was
[1:54:54] the scroll when he entered into the
[1:54:56] synagogue
[1:54:58] the bible tells us that when he found he
[1:55:01] opened the book
[1:55:04] and he opened the book and he found the
[1:55:06] place where it was written i want you to
[1:55:08] just look at this
[1:55:10] they gave him the scroll
[1:55:13] and remember with the scroll it's not
[1:55:15] like our bibles
[1:55:17] they gave him that scroll of isaiah
[1:55:22] but the spirit that was upon him
[1:55:26] directed him to the place that was
[1:55:29] written
[1:55:30] for that hour
[1:55:34] for what was to be fulfilled in that
[1:55:37] hour he found the place that is written
[1:55:41] can i preach you might have been a bible
[1:55:44] reader all your life but when the spirit
[1:55:46] of god
[1:55:47] has come upon your life and that
[1:55:49] revelation begins to break forth
[1:55:51] in your life what does it do it guides
[1:55:53] you to the place
[1:55:54] that is written of you amen
[1:56:00] and this is what he said the spirit of
[1:56:02] the lord is upon
[1:56:04] me he hath anointed me to preach the
[1:56:06] gospel to the poor
[1:56:08] sent me to heal the brokenhearted preach
[1:56:10] deliverance to the captives
[1:56:12] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[1:56:14] set at liberty
[1:56:16] them that are bruised
[1:56:19] to preach the acceptable year
[1:56:22] of the lord
[1:56:28] he was coming with a person with a
[1:56:30] purpose
[1:56:32] the acceptable year is to bring a
[1:56:35] release
[1:56:37] a release to the poor
[1:56:41] the brokenhearted the captive he's
[1:56:44] coming
[1:56:45] to deal with things that are holding
[1:56:49] his people
[1:56:53] and it's going to be proclaimed to
[1:56:55] preach the acceptable year of the lord
[1:56:59] you know remember you know the brother
[1:57:02] brown would get in this
[1:57:05] sometimes the discussion would come up
[1:57:07] you know the catholic church said well
[1:57:09] you know we're the original
[1:57:10] church and they say you know well
[1:57:13] you know god gave the authority to the
[1:57:16] church to remit
[1:57:17] sins brother branson said he did
[1:57:22] yeah he said they you know god gave the
[1:57:24] authority now see they're pulling from
[1:57:25] scripture
[1:57:26] out of matthew 16. jesus and brother
[1:57:29] brown said like this he said
[1:57:30] i'll go along with you on that scripture
[1:57:34] if you do it the bible way
[1:57:39] remember i'm talking about all tables
[1:57:40] are full of filthiness and vomit
[1:57:44] you see the way the the the way and
[1:57:46] written it called a denominational way
[1:57:49] because denomination are gates that
[1:57:52] close off
[1:57:53] the presence of god are you with me
[1:57:57] they they shut out the friends of god
[1:58:00] who actually is the one that they need
[1:58:02] in their midst
[1:58:03] to bring deliverance but remember he
[1:58:05] doesn't come outside
[1:58:07] of the word he comes in the form of his
[1:58:10] word
[1:58:13] amen amen the revelation it prevails
[1:58:16] what does it do
[1:58:16] that revelation that reveals jesus
[1:58:18] christ to be the same yesterday
[1:58:21] today and forever
[1:58:27] amen
[1:58:31] how was sins remitted when peter
[1:58:34] preached
[1:58:36] he says repent are you with me
[1:58:39] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:58:42] jesus christ
[1:58:44] let me just say it to you very clearly
[1:58:46] if you repented baptism goes with
[1:58:48] repentance
[1:58:52] amen hallelujah what god deals with the
[1:58:55] heart don't let not stand in your way
[1:58:57] listen
[1:58:57] myself i was baptized again from when i
[1:59:00] first started walking with god
[1:59:01] you know i'm talking about when i was
[1:59:03] you know i was 13 years old man i was 10
[1:59:05] years old
[1:59:06] and you know i did i have to be baptized
[1:59:08] again no i didn't
[1:59:10] but i recognized right at that point
[1:59:12] when god had dealt with my life as a 19
[1:59:15] year old boy i
[1:59:16] really right now i know what i'm doing i
[1:59:19] know who i'm identifying with
[1:59:21] there was things at that time and there
[1:59:23] was business there was things that god
[1:59:25] was dealing with my heart i don't know
[1:59:27] how many that even right now since i've
[1:59:29] been pastor

[1:59:42] be baptized again

[1:59:45] look at it you want to have confidence
[1:59:48] in your walk with god

[1:59:54] saying if you've never been
[1:59:55] baptized in the name of jesus christ

[2:00:15] amen amen this is a real remission
[2:00:18] of sins where the holy ghost comes down
[2:00:24] that's why brother branham he's standing
[2:00:28] there
[2:00:32] he's preaching brother braham is trying
[2:00:34] to show the congregation
[2:00:37] the authority of the word
[2:00:40] in the message end time seed sign he
[2:00:41] tells it
[2:00:44] he came into a meeting at the church
[2:00:45] there in the tabernacle
[2:00:48] they had told brother branham you know
[2:00:51] this young lady was on a cot
[2:00:55] and she couldn't get off that cot she
[2:00:57] was
[2:00:58] she was just sick she was real bad
[2:01:01] brother brandon said to prove something
[2:01:04] to my church
[2:01:06] he said i never touched that child
[2:01:09] i went straight to the pulpit
[2:01:12] he said i preached the word hallelujah
[2:01:18] now let me just tell you what the
[2:01:19] preaching of the word does you already
[2:01:21] know
[2:01:22] it changes the atmosphere
[2:01:27] in the beginning you go back to genesis
[2:01:29] 1. darkness was all around
[2:01:33] is that right and god said let
[2:01:36] there be light and the spirit of god
[2:01:40] begin to move the spirit
[2:01:44] follows the word amen
[2:01:48] hallelujah this is why jesus when he
[2:01:50] said if any man
[2:01:51] love me he will keep my
[2:01:54] saints amen and we will come and make
[2:01:59] our abode in you it's genesis 1.
[2:02:03] the word is spoken and the spirit of god
[2:02:06] comes to perform that word
[2:02:10] hallelujah glory be to god
[2:02:14] brother ram said as i stood there and i
[2:02:16] preached
[2:02:17] he said he said you know he said to
[2:02:19] think that child was bound for a
[2:02:21] premature grave
[2:02:24] and the word instantly
[2:02:28] healed her understand
[2:02:32] brother brown ain't trying to start
[2:02:33] another doctrine here but he was trying
[2:02:36] to get the people to see
[2:02:38] the power that's in the revealed word of
[2:02:40] the hour
[2:02:42] because it's not a man's word
[2:02:52] every time when i'm standing right here
[2:02:54] i'm waiting on him to come
[2:02:57] i'm waiting on him to come and the
[2:02:59] anointing to move down and for him to
[2:03:01] start bringing the word together
[2:03:05] sometimes i sit right back there in that
[2:03:06] office or other places and
[2:03:08] counseling or whatever more i don't
[2:03:09] enter in with the agenda i just wait
[2:03:11] try to be available oh my sometimes
[2:03:14] waiting and just listening and just
[2:03:15] listening but oh my you don't know what
[2:03:17] a comfort it is
[2:03:18] when all of a sudden i know that he's
[2:03:20] come here
[2:03:24] oh my it's at that time man i mean when
[2:03:26] you're in that moment right there
[2:03:28] there ain't a devil can lift its head
[2:03:32] and what i'm trying to say that ain't
[2:03:34] just for me
[2:03:35] that's for you as believers
[2:03:38] it isn't how you feel it's the power of
[2:03:41] that word
[2:03:42] because it's not you that's saying it
[2:03:45] it's the deity of
[2:03:47] god the holy ghost
[2:03:49] [Applause]
[2:03:52] hallelujah if you say to this mountain
[2:03:56] amen if you say to this mountain
[2:03:59] be thou removed blessed
[2:04:04] be the lord very simple brother brown
[2:04:06] says the word went forth
[2:04:08] and she believed the word and the word
[2:04:10] is god's life and god's power
[2:04:12] and the word is what does it mean he
[2:04:15] said he is the word and when you receive
[2:04:17] the word
[2:04:18] you receive jesus for he is the word
[2:04:22] and the word is made flesh and dwelt
[2:04:25] among us
[2:04:28] he never said do you see it or do you
[2:04:29] feel it do you believe it
[2:04:33] as you believe that word has that words
[2:04:35] coming forth
[2:04:36] cast aside every imagination cast aside
[2:04:39] every doubt
[2:04:39] cast aside every line spirit cast aside
[2:04:42] every voice that speaks contrary
[2:04:44] and just let the word speak to your
[2:04:46] heart what are you doing i'm looking
[2:04:48] unto jesus
[2:04:55] and where the spirit of the lord is
[2:04:59] there is liberty amen hallelujah
[2:05:03] there is liberty
[2:05:11] liberty that sounds forth to your heart
[2:05:15] freedom freedom
[2:05:21] his burden is light yes it is
[2:05:28] to serve the lord is not a burden
[2:05:34] if it's burdensome if it's a drudgery
[2:05:38] why don't you trade that out smile
[2:05:43] if it's a burden to live right trade
[2:05:44] that out you you don't have his burden
[2:05:47] his burden is light
[2:05:52] you can't live his word
[2:05:55] by your own life it has to be his life
[2:06:00] inside of you
[2:06:03] and where the spirit of the lord is
[2:06:05] there is
[2:06:07] liberty now remember
[2:06:11] he's the lord of the sabbath
[2:06:15] are you with me when that sounding would
[2:06:19] go forth
[2:06:19] across israel
[2:06:24] there were many of them remember they
[2:06:27] were sold as
[2:06:29] they were sons sons
[2:06:33] but a debt had come up and they had to
[2:06:37] you know go pay or work off that debt
[2:06:42] but when the time of jubilee was come
[2:06:48] this wasn't just a seventh year this was
[2:06:51] the jubilee
[2:06:53] this is when all debts were settled
[2:06:56] because you remember on the seventh year
[2:06:58] there was seven sabbath on the seventh
[2:06:59] year
[2:07:00] everybody was free to go for that year
[2:07:02] but then they had to return back
[2:07:04] are you with me this is the jubilee
[2:07:07] that's what the rest of the holy ghost
[2:07:09] is it's a jubilee
[2:07:11] it's where debts are released
[2:07:15] it's where burdens are lifted
[2:07:18] it's where all that was against you is
[2:07:21] struck
[2:07:24] off
[2:07:27] never to be brought up in me amen
[2:07:42] man walking was a cot told you
[2:07:46] who told you take that cotton start
[2:07:48] carrying it around
[2:07:52] the same same one who healed my eyes
[2:07:58] the same one who gave me eyeballs
[2:08:03] the same one and put that paste
[2:08:06] upon my where eyeballs were at
[2:08:10] who told you to do that the one
[2:08:13] who put clay
[2:08:16] upon my eyes the one who gave me my
[2:08:20] sight
[2:08:22] the man at the pool of bethesda who was
[2:08:24] laying there for 38 years with an
[2:08:27] infirmity
[2:08:28] are you hearing me brother braham said
[2:08:30] that that man would have lived to
[2:08:32] you know an old age that wasn't a prayer
[2:08:35] it wasn't a pressing
[2:08:36] issue as far as maybe like cancer or
[2:08:38] something else
[2:08:40] but do you realize god came down
[2:08:43] and i believe that's for me and you to
[2:08:45] show you and me
[2:08:46] that no matter how what we would look at
[2:08:49] like
[2:08:50] well i can live with this i i've been
[2:08:51] living with her for 38 years
[2:08:53] but jesus comes down and says
[2:08:56] you don't have to live a 38 and a half
[2:08:59] or 38 and 38
[2:09:01] after 39 you don't have to live with it
[2:09:03] no longer
[2:09:04] amen who does that the lord of the
[2:09:08] sabbath
[2:09:09] the son of man the word made flesh
[2:09:19] who told you to do that jesus
[2:09:23] amen
[2:09:28] they took counsel how they could kill
[2:09:30] him that's the bible
[2:09:39] what they failed to recognize there was
[2:09:42] a need
[2:09:45] these people were in need amen
[2:09:51] here's a woman
[2:09:55] you know this from the sabbath here's a
[2:09:57] woman
[2:09:58] she's been bent over
[2:10:02] i can't now there's been some times in
[2:10:05] my life
[2:10:07] from my back some of you know the deal
[2:10:11] with back things
[2:10:13] i mean you don't want to cough you don't
[2:10:15] want to sneeze laugh
[2:10:17] nothing because everything hurts it's
[2:10:20] just radiating
[2:10:23] and i know some of you had a lot of
[2:10:24] things a lot worse than that but i'll
[2:10:26] tell you
[2:10:27] god brings them things back to your
[2:10:28] memory it humbles you
[2:10:31] she was all bound over
[2:10:38] she was looking her face her
[2:10:42] everything was she was she was cast over
[2:10:45] but here jesus notice what he does
[2:10:47] listen the word speaks to her
[2:10:50] and says woman thou art loosed
[2:10:53] from thy infirmity she couldn't stand up
[2:10:56] straight
[2:11:00] he said woman you're loose from your
[2:11:02] infirmity
[2:11:05] then he walked over and he laid his
[2:11:07] hands on her
[2:11:09] and immediately she straightened out
[2:11:15] why he is the lord of the sabbath
[2:11:20] i say that's why the reality that that
[2:11:23] here
[2:11:24] in the evening time it's revealed that
[2:11:26] jesus
[2:11:27] is not the second person of the godhead
[2:11:30] but it is the same almighty god
[2:11:33] the same jesus yesterday today and
[2:11:36] forever
[2:11:40] hallelujah
[2:11:44] this was a bondage that was upon her
[2:11:46] life
[2:11:47] the devil had her bound
[2:11:50] she was a daughter of abraham
[2:11:54] but this infirmity this affliction jesus
[2:11:57] said
[2:11:57] that the devil has put up on her
[2:12:01] bound her so she couldn't even walk
[2:12:04] right
[2:12:07] that day was her day
[2:12:12] i don't know what was in her heart that
[2:12:13] morning i don't know but i know one
[2:12:15] thing
[2:12:16] that that day was her day the faith
[2:12:20] that she needed in order to boost her
[2:12:23] faith to be able to straighten out to be
[2:12:26] able to stand upright
[2:12:27] it came to her that day
[2:12:32] and the burden that she was under was
[2:12:35] lifted
[2:12:41] i'm not here just taking time we're not
[2:12:44] here just taking time
[2:12:45] there was a man with the dropsy that
[2:12:48] didn't mean he couldn't hold on to
[2:12:49] things
[2:12:50] that's edema for you you know you you uh
[2:12:54] nurses and different things like that
[2:12:55] water retention
[2:12:57] like from kidney failure from heart
[2:13:00] uh heart failure congestive heart
[2:13:03] failure he had the dropsy
[2:13:06] and jesus came the situation that he was
[2:13:10] in but jesus came
[2:13:13] and released that build up on his life
[2:13:17] oh my god what was water
[2:13:21] he was holding he was holding water you
[2:13:23] were a man he wasn't meant to hold that
[2:13:25] water let me just tell you something
[2:13:26] there's a lot of things now preach with
[2:13:28] me there are a lot of things even in
[2:13:30] your christian journey
[2:13:31] you can accumulate a lot of stuff
[2:13:34] there's a lot of things that can start
[2:13:36] building up in your life you can get
[2:13:38] hurts built up
[2:13:39] you can let condemnation build up a lot
[2:13:42] of things start
[2:13:43] building up that doesn't allow you to
[2:13:45] operate right
[2:13:50] but jesus comes
[2:13:53] and he says lay it aside
[2:13:57] lay it aside cast it down
[2:14:03] let me read this to you in closing this
[2:14:06] is simple
[2:14:08] and i'm not making light of that but i
[2:14:09] want you to understand the simplicity
[2:14:11] satan
[2:14:12] wants to try to corrupt the simplicity
[2:14:17] in the seal of the antichrist
[2:14:21] he can go freely talking about when
[2:14:25] that one who's in bondage hears the
[2:14:28] sound
[2:14:28] of the trumpet there's no price to pay
[2:14:32] there's nothing to go through with how
[2:14:35] do you do it brother branham
[2:14:38] just drop your hope
[2:14:42] whatever you're working with and come
[2:14:46] lovely and take your
[2:14:49] freedom free
[2:14:54] i think brother andrew demonstrated to
[2:14:55] hear you here last week
[2:14:58] drop yes don't reason it
[2:15:02] drop it
[2:15:06] drop it and come take your freedom
[2:15:10] free there's not a thing you have to do
[2:15:13] brother branham will i have to be done
[2:15:16] this way or
[2:15:16] done that way you don't have to do
[2:15:18] nothing you have to accept it
[2:15:22] just say lord jesus i'm so thankful that
[2:15:25] you've brought freedom to me
[2:15:27] that you took me out of the bondage of a
[2:15:29] whirling
[2:15:30] mind that i didn't know where i was at
[2:15:34] i tried i joined different churches i
[2:15:36] went from place to place
[2:15:38] i tried to get right i didn't know what
[2:15:40] to do but now i'm coming on the basis
[2:15:43] that you died in my stead and i'm
[2:15:45] accepting you right now as my savior
[2:15:48] watch how the love of god will sway
[2:15:52] down into your heart peace
[2:15:55] that passes all understanding will
[2:15:58] soothe over
[2:15:59] i don't care what my neighbor says
[2:16:01] you'll love him
[2:16:02] anyhow
[2:16:06] i'm telling you his burden is light
[2:16:09] that's true if you're carrying a burden
[2:16:13] today
[2:16:14] you might be sealed away with god
[2:16:18] in his presence but if you're carrying a
[2:16:21] burden
[2:16:23] release it
[2:16:26] let's say brother branham speaks to a
[2:16:28] man in 1964.
[2:16:31] i don't know exactly what the man was
[2:16:32] was holding
[2:16:34] but the spirit of god calls him out and
[2:16:37] he says sir
[2:16:39] he said you've got to let the past in
[2:16:41] the past
[2:16:43] he said you're a minister of the gospel
[2:16:46] he said if you don't let that go
[2:16:47] it's going to cause a nervous breakdown
[2:16:50] he said but you've got to let it
[2:16:52] go in the name of jesus christ
[2:16:58] hallelujah it might have been a sickness
[2:17:02] that's come up on your way
[2:17:06] what do i do let it go
[2:17:10] that means put it in his hands committed
[2:17:13] to god
[2:17:15] like the man you might say well you know
[2:17:16] i could live with this i i've been going
[2:17:18] on okay
[2:17:19] but why not but who says that you're to
[2:17:21] continue on with it i say today's the
[2:17:28] day
[2:17:31] today's the day today is the day when it
[2:17:34] when it when it rains
[2:17:36] it raises within your heart to say
[2:17:38] enough is enough
[2:17:46] and let the word have free course
[2:17:49] satan has no place here he has no place
[2:17:53] in hearts
[2:17:54] he's a liar
[2:17:58] let me just tell you something right now
[2:18:00] he is
[2:18:01] fearful of the word taking hold
[2:18:06] he knows when believers begin to believe
[2:18:10] he trembles
[2:18:13] he can't stand in the presence of the
[2:18:16] holy ghost
[2:18:20] his burden is light yes
[2:18:25] weights there's not one person here
[2:18:28] not one of us here there's all
[2:18:32] throughout here
[2:18:32] we could go along and long and ask
[2:18:34] people you know and i think many times
[2:18:36] even
[2:18:36] individuals that i become more aware of
[2:18:38] it now you know
[2:18:40] sometimes the older you get and i know
[2:18:42] i'm still a young boy but sometimes when
[2:18:44] the older you get you begin to have a
[2:18:45] little bit more
[2:18:46] uh not that you had disrespect but you
[2:18:48] begin to have more respect for those who
[2:18:50] are even older
[2:18:51] knowing battles they've had to go
[2:18:52] through
[2:18:54] knowing how many times they've had to
[2:18:55] lay it lay aside
[2:18:57] things people have said this or this has
[2:18:59] been said or
[2:19:00] i've been done wrong here i've been done
[2:19:02] and they've had to you know what in
[2:19:03] order to move on with god they've had to
[2:19:05] lay aside
[2:19:06] that weight they had to lay it aside
[2:19:10] because they ain't doing nothing good
[2:19:11] it's weighing them down sometimes a
[2:19:14] person can carry a weight
[2:19:16] in their life for years
[2:19:20] and they don't need to carry it maybe
[2:19:22] it's a ruined relationship
[2:19:24] maybe it's a it's a broken thing you
[2:19:27] know but i'm among family and everything
[2:19:28] else and they'll carry that weight
[2:19:30] instead of giving it to the lord jesus
[2:19:34] and remember he didn't say i'll come and
[2:19:37] take it
[2:19:38] he said lay it aside
[2:19:41] it's that simple right it's to lay it
[2:19:44] aside as brother branham in that prayer
[2:19:47] i just read to you
[2:19:49] he said lord i accept that freedom
[2:19:54] you've got sickness lord i accept
[2:19:58] my healing his burden
[2:20:02] is light let's pray
[2:20:08] lord jesus
[2:20:12] freedom is here
[2:20:19] lord the time of burdens
[2:20:22] to be released is here
[2:20:28] lord jesus
[2:20:34] our faith and our confidence it's in you
[2:20:40] it's not the man who has his hands upon
[2:20:44] us and prays for us our faith
[2:20:48] is in you
[2:20:51] that's where we receive
[2:20:55] what it is we have need
[2:20:58] the lord i pray here this morning
[2:21:04] you're the lovely one that's here in our
[2:21:06] midst
[2:21:10] i pray right now lord
[2:21:15] that god for every hole
[2:21:18] that's present if there's a heart
[2:21:21] that desires to be set free
[2:21:27] a life lord whether it be the bondage of
[2:21:29] sin
[2:21:32] whether it be lord that in their life
[2:21:36] lord
[2:21:38] condemnation that they're carrying
[2:21:43] lord of sickness
[2:21:47] dear god your burden
[2:21:51] is light
[2:21:55] lord i pray
[2:21:58] that right now may they accept that
[2:22:03] and in their heart
[2:22:07] as you took brother branham lord and
[2:22:09] would express that back to a heart

[2:29:38] you know brother branham tells a little
[2:29:40] simple story when they took a prayer
[2:29:41] cloth
[2:29:43] to a a little older german sister
[2:29:46] and they they took that prayer cloth to
[2:29:49] her house and
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:51] and they you know had prayed over it and
[2:29:52] they gave it to her
[2:29:54] i came here with the sickness she was
[2:29:56] suffering with cancer or whatever it was
[2:29:59] but she she pinned that
[2:30:02] that that that little prayer cloth right
[2:30:05] there on on her
[2:30:06] uh on her garment and when she she
[2:30:09] pinned it on there
[2:30:10] brother brandon said what she spoke at
[2:30:11] that time she said all right mr devil
[2:30:14] it's time for you to leave
[2:30:18] i don't got time for you no more
[2:30:21] you might as well go on out of here
[2:30:25] it was just that simple
[2:30:28] just to apply that
[2:30:33] god stands behind his word
[2:30:36] if you're standing on his word
[2:30:37] everything is clear but the same you
[2:30:39] know how do i know if everything's clear
[2:30:40] if your heart don't condemn you and let
[2:30:43] me just tell you something if you
[2:30:45] confessed
[2:30:46] if you repented there ain't no
[2:30:49] condemnation
[2:30:51] now the devil might try to come and say
[2:30:54] this and say that and put that
[2:30:55] but when it has been repented of and
[2:30:57] confessed
[2:30:59] that's only the devil trying to bluff
[2:31:00] you
[2:31:02] you can stand right there on god's word
[2:31:06] because you know from the desire of your
[2:31:08] heart it's lined up with god
[2:31:10] see the spirit of truth it lines up
[2:31:14] then you can stand right there and like
[2:31:16] that old little german sister
[2:31:18] all right mr devil we don't have time
[2:31:21] for you no more
[2:31:23] get out of here
[2:31:28] that's the authority of this word
[2:31:32] how many times brother branham would as
[2:31:34] he would say anyone brother branham
[2:31:35] saying it but he knew by experience
[2:31:37] and the holy spirit would declare it
[2:31:39] you'll find this in a certain day
[2:31:41] you'll find this happen in a certain
[2:31:43] time you'll see the results from this
[2:31:46] [Music]
[2:31:50] i think of one sister brother branham
[2:31:52] prayed for it was one that
[2:31:54] that they knew 18 months later
[2:31:58] she received her healing but the holy
[2:32:01] spirit had told her
[2:32:03] go and the lord you'll find your healing
[2:32:06] he prayed for you see the word was
[2:32:10] certain what god has spoken it's certain
[2:32:13] the word is a seed you take it in your
[2:32:16] heart
[2:32:16] i didn't feel anything it ain't about
[2:32:18] what you feel
[2:32:20] are you with me you can have a lot of
[2:32:22] good feelings but after all the feelings
[2:32:24] has the word been planted the word
