[27:34] yes sir
[28:00] what a beautiful psalm and i
[28:04] just can't help but those verses that

[28:10] those verses were some inspiration that
[28:12] struck there
[28:14] for those verses to be wrote
[28:17] i think it was one of the brothers here
[28:20] i'm not sure maybe it was brother brian
[28:22] that just inspiration instruct that i'm
[28:25] not sure
[28:26] but i know those verses are not part of
[28:28] that song they were in the past
[28:30] but it's it's it's the absolute truth
[28:34] we certainly have a real song of victory
[28:37] and you know when we look all through
[28:39] the promises of god's word
[28:42] that's what we're to see is nothing but
[28:44] victory

[31:42] you continue to be in prayer and how
[31:45] that the lord will
[31:47] direct us and provide for us in that so
[31:51] um i want to just say reiterate as
[31:54] as brother paul had mentioned there uh
[31:56] happy mother's day
[31:58] and certainly uh i'm just grateful to
[32:01] have my mother
[32:02] uh here with me and um i just really
[32:06] am just so thankful to the lord for that
[32:10] and also really appreciate my wife and
[32:12] for each and every mother
[32:14] that is that is out there and we
[32:17] certainly love and appreciate you what a
[32:19] great responsibility that you have
[32:21] i remember the prophet would let us know
[32:24] clearly
[32:24] you're the fifth gospel and so what a
[32:27] what a great responsibility it is
[32:29] what a great thing it is and i think for
[32:32] each and every one of the children
[32:33] and different ones um what a blessing it
[32:36] is to have
[32:37] have a real mother to have a godly
[32:40] mother
[32:41] it's just such a real blessing and so we
[32:44] want to remember with that
[32:45] um i want you to remember i think of
[32:49] today i was sitting in the office there
[32:51] and just thinking also we want to
[32:53] remember
[32:55] brother bill's brother bill and and the
[32:57] children there i think that this is the
[32:59] first
[33:00] mother's day uh without uh sister mary
[33:04] and sister mary was such a wonderful
[33:07] such a wonderful mother so we want to
[33:08] remember them in prayer that god will
[33:10] just strengthen them
[33:12] in this in this day as well because they
[33:15] certainly got a lot of good memories
[33:18] amen and that just that's one thing that
[33:20] i i think god gives us that
[33:22] vault of memory we can unlock and think
[33:25] about all that care and so
[33:27] i also want to remember
[33:31] brother richard had mentioned to me here
[33:34] with
[33:36] jamie um that we would keep her in
[33:38] prayer
[33:39] that would that's liliana's mother
[33:43] this is a very obviously would be a very
[33:45] difficult day for her
[33:47] and as he expressed she's a wonderful
[33:49] mother and
[33:50] that the lord would bless her so we want
[33:52] to just
[33:53] just have as we've approached the throne
[33:55] of god right now
[33:56] as we're getting ready to look into the
[33:58] word and you have a need on your heart
[34:00] you just hold that before the throne of
[34:02] god and we're just going to go in prayer
[34:04] and ask his leadership now in the word
[34:08] heavenly father as we lord are just so
[34:10] thankful

[36:30] prayer right now
[36:31] just now take control lord in the
[36:33] further part of the service for your
[36:35] glory
[36:36] in jesus name amen
[36:40] god bless you i'm just going to read one
[36:42] scripture
[36:44] and i'd like to go into that scripture
[36:47] once again
[36:53] uh ephesians 6 and verse 17 as we're
[36:56] looking at the armor of god
[37:07] and just verse 17 is where i want to
[37:09] just
[37:10] read that and then we'll let you have
[37:11] your seats
[37:13] and take the helmet of salvation
[37:17] and the sword of the spirit
[37:20] which is the word of god
[37:24] amen may god bless you and bless the
[37:26] reading of the word as you're being
[37:27] seated
[37:34] when we we look at this
[37:38] here in the scriptures we have been for
[37:40] a few
[37:41] services now and just
[37:45] how the holy spirit has just been taken
[37:48] the direction within it
[37:51] um one thing that we
[37:54] just my attention and my heart was just
[37:57] drawn to
[37:58] the lord is because when we
[38:02] when we speak when the scripture says
[38:05] take unto you and
[38:08] it's it is that which is already in our
[38:12] possession when we have received
[38:14] the holy spirit the word of god is
[38:18] wrapped up in our lives but one thing
[38:22] that is
[38:22] certain and i believe that we can all
[38:25] agree on this
[38:26] is that everything that we have need of
[38:30] has already been provided and
[38:34] the and and and the prophet would help
[38:37] us
[38:38] to be able to realize that it's not
[38:40] something out here
[38:42] but he would help us to look deep you
[38:45] see the word
[38:46] when the word comes in season
[38:49] and in time it causes us
[38:52] to look within
[38:56] and that looking within is never
[38:59] to stop uh in our lives but it
[39:02] it causes us to uh to to look within
[39:06] in our lives and and really to be able
[39:10] to
[39:11] uh seeing even of who we are
[39:15] and as we're looking at this of the word
[39:17] it's things that
[39:19] as we're seeing of that the word itself
[39:22] is is a word that truly we we don't want
[39:26] the sword of the word of the spirit
[39:29] to be in the sheath it's to be out of
[39:32] the sheath
[39:33] and that's exactly what the holy spirit
[39:35] is making known
[39:36] that this is where the word of god is to
[39:40] be
[39:41] uh active in our lives
[39:44] and so when paul would write because
[39:47] there are promises
[39:49] that belong to us and it's up to us to
[39:53] to take those promises and i was saying
[39:55] moments ago
[39:56] when we look within our lives we
[39:59] recognize that
[40:00] everything that we have need of him
[40:03] brother branham would say it like this
[40:04] he said
[40:05] even that of the rapture is
[40:08] in you already
[40:11] so it's dealing with his working within
[40:14] our lives
[40:14] it's recognizing the power that already
[40:18] lays within us and remember with the
[40:22] looking at that of the sword that
[40:25] being that of the word of god that it
[40:28] takes as we've been looking at this
[40:30] a strong hand of faith to hold that
[40:33] sword
[40:34] and notice a strong hand of faith to
[40:37] hold the sword
[40:38] so it requires a courage and
[40:41] we look at it in the scripture here in
[40:44] in the book of galatians chapter 5 and
[40:47] verse 6 and it expresses to us
[40:49] that faith worketh by love
[40:54] and you know as we were
[40:57] looking at at these things even of last
[41:00] week and how the holy spirit just
[41:02] quickening those those parts to our life
[41:04] that we understand that there can be
[41:09] a person can have faith to move
[41:11] mountains and i want you to remember
[41:13] this
[41:14] even where the lord jesus talked about
[41:17] there would be those
[41:18] who would come before him on that day
[41:21] and say lord didn't i cast out devils in
[41:25] your name
[41:26] didn't we speak with other tongues so
[41:28] forth and goes on
[41:30] now all of that it's by faith
[41:33] but yet we recognize that there
[41:36] is a difference in just a person having
[41:41] faith and then a person having
[41:44] faith that is operated by the love of
[41:46] god
[41:47] which the love of god is the promise of
[41:51] god
[41:51] the life of god that is released to us
[41:54] as a believer
[41:55] so in other words i'm talking about a
[41:58] relationship here
[42:00] because faith itself is produced
[42:03] by love and we're talking about promises
[42:07] that pertain to us as believers in this
[42:10] hour
[42:11] um god did not even from the very
[42:14] beginning of even where
[42:15] we set or or would stand in the grace of
[42:19] god this morning
[42:20] it is because promises have been
[42:22] ministered to us
[42:24] and the spirit of god has caused us to
[42:27] rise
[42:28] in faith to receive and accept
[42:31] that promise that belongs to us and it
[42:34] is the same way
[42:36] with every promise that is still laid
[42:39] out before us
[42:40] that includes the promise of the rapture
[42:44] the promise of the rapture is that which
[42:47] will indeed
[42:48] be taken by the love of god so
[42:51] pulsating in our hearts in our lives
[42:55] it brings about a faith to where
[42:59] it it it it comes into this place to
[43:02] where
[43:03] if he was going to take only one
[43:06] out of the city that we live in no
[43:09] offense
[43:09] but that's going to be me if that's
[43:13] going to be me
[43:14] if he's coming for somebody it's going
[43:16] to be me
[43:17] now these are not just good words this
[43:20] is something that's
[43:22] personal to us this is not something
[43:25] that's
[43:26] outside of us we've got a basis
[43:29] for that stand in our lives
[43:33] and that basis is the love of god
[43:36] that is in our hearts then that love
[43:39] love
[43:40] faith remember faith itself without
[43:43] any works without
[43:47] any works then faith is dead
[43:50] but you see the works must be connected
[43:53] with the faith
[43:54] that is given by god in this hour
[43:58] because you can find many people or
[44:00] individuals
[44:01] within religion or within another place
[44:04] they have faith and they'll have a lot
[44:06] of good works
[44:08] but we're not talking about good works
[44:10] thank god for good works
[44:12] i appreciate good people i mean i
[44:15] appreciate people that
[44:17] you know you work with them or come in
[44:18] contact or you know i appreciate people
[44:20] who've got clean mouths
[44:22] i appreciate and i'm not talking about
[44:24] food particles i'm talking about where
[44:26] they're not talking foul
[44:27] i i appreciate those things i appreciate
[44:30] where you can
[44:31] talk with somebody they come to service
[44:33] something in your house or
[44:35] we appreciate all that but we're talking
[44:37] about
[44:38] works that are not man-made works
[44:41] we're talking about works that are the
[44:44] works
[44:44] of god that are holy works
[44:48] because of a holy faith we're talking
[44:50] about
[44:51] works of the outworking of his life
[44:54] working and moving through us
[44:57] like abraham the works of abraham was
[45:00] only
[45:01] the outworking of what god's thoughts
[45:04] were concerning the promise the promise
[45:08] was given
[45:09] now it was time for that word to be
[45:11] reflected through abraham's life
[45:14] so it was god the holy faith of god
[45:18] revealed to in and through abraham
[45:22] and it came manifest in works
[45:25] and jesus remember when he said i must
[45:28] work the works of him while it's dead
[45:31] he said that even for our lives
[45:35] that uh the works that i do
[45:38] shall you do also so it is
[45:42] him in us fulfilling his own word so
[45:46] then if it's him in us fulfilling his
[45:48] own word remember
[45:50] he won't override our will
[45:54] so it is our will being surrendered to
[45:57] him
[45:58] so how is our will surrendered to him
[46:01] he he comes and he moves
[46:04] in our life by divine love
[46:07] and love brings submission
[46:10] and surrender it brings confidence
[46:14] it brings rest and so when we
[46:18] would think of this here i want to go uh
[46:21] right back into this here with esther
[46:24] and just resume here just for a few
[46:27] moments in picking this up where we left
[46:29] off
[46:29] and i want i want you as a congregation
[46:32] to be
[46:33] very uh to be very um
[46:37] focused on here here is esther
[46:40] she's already been anointed
[46:43] queen she has the crown upon her head
[46:49] how long of a time was it from where
[46:52] she's anointed
[46:54] to where now the conspiracy
[46:57] of haman comes about to destroy
[47:00] i don't know how many years that was i
[47:02] don't know how much time but i'm just
[47:04] going to say it in this manner
[47:06] there was a time that esther was just
[47:10] she was enjoying the delights
[47:13] of being queen was it really
[47:16] really real within the sense of where of
[47:20] what she was purposed for
[47:22] i'm certain that esther just could not
[47:24] even at that moment when the crown was
[47:26] set on her head
[47:27] she could not even fully be able to
[47:30] comprehend what has happened
[47:32] would you think of this here is a little
[47:35] girl
[47:36] she's been raised by her uncle
[47:41] she is you know she doesn't even have
[47:43] she wasn't brought here by her father
[47:45] she wasn't brought her by her mother
[47:47] she's been raised by her uncle
[47:50] so now where she comes to a place
[47:53] and to think of all the rest of the
[47:56] because remember
[47:57] all the fair young virgins came in there
[47:59] they were not all jews
[48:02] she was the jew she's the one where the
[48:05] scripture
[48:06] notice out of all of it it says fair
[48:08] young virgins
[48:09] but the scripture highlights and it's as
[48:11] though the light
[48:13] singles out like a person on stage and
[48:16] the rest
[48:16] are part of the background but the light
[48:19] and the
[48:20] focus is upon esther let me just say
[48:23] this to you
[48:24] there are many many others that have
[48:27] been that are fair
[48:28] young virgins and remember the king
[48:31] if he he did not send them back out into
[48:34] the world or the provinces
[48:36] they went to the house of the concubines
[48:39] there's been many fair virgins but i'm
[48:43] telling you
[48:43] the spotlight down through the ages this
[48:47] is where
[48:48] the elective grace of god comes in
[48:51] the spotlight spotlight meaning that of
[48:53] the word
[48:54] remember his word is light
[48:57] and his word has come to lighten as he
[49:01] revealed himself
[49:02] to paul he said that his word that was
[49:05] given to paul
[49:06] that it would remove the darkness and
[49:09] the power of
[49:10] satan from the gentiles and that we
[49:13] would be
[49:14] illuminated with the light of almighty
[49:16] god
[49:17] what light are we talking about we're
[49:19] talking about the light
[49:21] which is the image of god the same
[49:24] image that they fell from
[49:27] in the garden of eden now in christ
[49:31] that same spirit image that same
[49:35] uh living word that same life of god
[49:38] is now imparted into
[49:42] the life of a believer
[49:45] so the rest as i was saying remember
[49:48] when a light is cast on stage
[49:50] you can the light itself there'll be
[49:52] other parts you can see
[49:53] but those are not the focal point
[49:57] thank god for salvation where many have
[50:00] been able to come
[50:01] and are john 3 16 christians
[50:06] are you with me thank god for that but
[50:08] you see the light
[50:09] itself remember the scripture says
[50:12] concerning the outpouring of the holy
[50:14] ghost
[50:15] that he would pour out his spirit upon
[50:18] all
[50:18] flesh and then it goes on to say
[50:21] and on that handmaidens and thy servants
[50:25] you see the light come it come directly
[50:29] for that of the elect
[50:32] it come to give life to that of the
[50:34] elect
[50:35] but and you think of it here we are like
[50:38] esther
[50:39] walking in the light what have we done
[50:41] to receive this
[50:43] nothing when you really look at it
[50:46] clearly
[50:47] and you see it how god has laid it out
[50:50] in the scripture
[50:54] i just want to pause on this for a
[50:55] moment when you
[50:57] see how clearly it is in the scripture
[51:00] jacob and esau esau was a much
[51:04] better man
[51:08] he was a much better man if you were
[51:11] going to choose a man to be a part
[51:13] of your assembly or your church or work
[51:16] alongside you on the
[51:17] on the line you would have picked esau
[51:20] but
[51:21] when god see only thing that could take
[51:24] place
[51:24] with jacob is when god comes and changes
[51:28] jacob brother it supersedes
[51:31] the fine morality of esau
[51:35] thank god for fine morality thank god
[51:39] for for for that fineness but this
[51:42] is where you see god has so placed it in
[51:46] a way
[51:46] to where you and i can look at those
[51:49] examples
[51:50] and listen in looking at those examples
[51:52] the word of god is to be a mirror
[51:55] that we are to look into and to
[51:58] recognize
[51:58] if not for god's grace that you
[52:02] and i would have not been chosen if the
[52:04] choosing was a man
[52:06] but god saw what was
[52:09] beneath and packed into the dirt
[52:14] and the light shining on the waters the
[52:17] water's
[52:18] thickness of multitudes of people the
[52:20] water the light
[52:22] shining on the water you and i were
[52:24] beneath the water but what happened the
[52:27] light come
[52:28] and it draws us up through all the
[52:30] thickness and multitudes and mixture
[52:32] and muck it gives us strength the light
[52:36] ministers to a strength to overcome all
[52:39] the mud
[52:39] that's packed into us
[52:44] and i don't care who you are where
[52:46] you've come from who your family is or
[52:48] whatever more
[52:49] let's just be honest with you there was
[52:50] a lot of there was a lot of browning
[52:52] brown and everything else kind of dirt
[52:54] that was packed into me and browning
[52:57] dirt ain't better than sanchez dirt
[52:59] and sanchez dirt ain't better than than
[53:01] gomez dirt we're all
[53:03] dirt come on friends
[53:06] god never come to highlight a family he
[53:09] came
[53:10] to identify his family that was
[53:13] already here
[53:17] this is why the scripture
[53:21] would speak to us and let me just let me
[53:23] read one verse of scripture here
[53:25] from esther in esther 5 1. now
[53:29] here's after the the uh the praying and
[53:32] the fasting
[53:34] where they've been praying and fasting i
[53:36] i i
[53:37] i like this approach when i say i like
[53:40] this approach
[53:40] it just identifies within my heart look
[53:43] at this esther herself
[53:45] when she when this comes the word is
[53:47] declared to her from mordecai
[53:49] she responds to it she acts upon she's
[53:52] acting upon it
[53:53] but notice she approaches it with prayer
[53:57] and fasting what is she doing she's
[54:00] making sure there's
[54:01] nothing that would hinder that word from
[54:05] coming to pass
[54:10] hallelujah and here she comes
[54:14] in verse one it says it come to pass on
[54:16] the third day
[54:17] that esther put on her royal apparel
[54:22] and she stood in the inner court of the
[54:25] king's house
[54:26] over against the king's house and the
[54:28] king
[54:29] set upon his roman troil in the royal
[54:31] house over against the gate
[54:34] of the house now she's not coming before
[54:37] the king in in her garments
[54:40] of mourning
[54:44] she has been granted
[54:47] given the royal apparel
[54:53] she didn't earn it she was
[54:56] granted that royal apparel
[55:00] she had to receive it so when she would
[55:03] stand in the king's court
[55:05] she is clothed with what
[55:08] the king has issued
[55:11] and what he has issued would declare
[55:15] already what and her position of who she
[55:18] is
[55:19] that apparel matches her crown
[55:23] you see he's provided oh my
[55:26] he's provided what is needed for you and
[55:30] i
[55:30] to be able to come and stand in his
[55:33] presence
[55:34] his blood has made a way
[55:39] amen in the spirit of god beckons to our
[55:42] heart
[55:43] calls to our life it moves upon our
[55:45] hearts with promise
[55:46] for promises to be taken think of this
[55:50] think of it now esther has been has been
[55:53] here
[55:54] in the palace of shushan
[55:57] how long well it certainly wasn't a
[56:00] month
[56:01] she's been here she's been feeding on
[56:04] the message
[56:08] her sword has really not had to come out
[56:11] except for cutting steak and putting
[56:14] putting butter on dinner rolls
[56:17] come on now but there but but the whole
[56:20] part
[56:20] is now for a time this time
[56:24] for such a time as this here's why
[56:27] you're here esther this is the
[56:29] appointment you see
[56:31] it brings to you and i the reality of
[56:34] this
[56:34] message that god has sent to us our part
[56:38] our purpose within it
[56:44] this is why that many times
[56:48] where the sincerity is lacked of why
[56:51] that that that we're not moving upon
[56:54] promises the way we ought to
[56:56] is because the question still
[56:59] arises in our minds is it really me
[57:03] is he really talking about me does he
[57:06] mean me
[57:08] these are things and this was this was
[57:10] something the spirit of god
[57:12] identifies where the prophet calls it
[57:14] out and he told us he said i'm going to
[57:16] speak on those things he
[57:18] he identifies in the message of prisoner
[57:20] and he said
[57:21] that right there i'm going to start
[57:23] speaking on that and he does
[57:25] he deals and addresses with how can i
[57:27] overcome perfect faith
[57:28] christ is the mystery it's dealing with
[57:31] these
[57:31] principles and this ground that we're to
[57:34] stand on
[57:39] hallelujah you see
[57:43] esther they think of this the scripture
[57:46] if i can just refer to it a place in the
[57:48] book of corinthians
[57:50] paul reminds those in corinth
[57:53] of how and he talks about the the
[57:56] weakness of god is stronger than man
[57:58] he talks about base things that god has
[58:01] chosen weak things
[58:03] to confound the wise he said you see how
[58:07] many
[58:07] not many wise are called but it's
[58:10] those that that that god calls that that
[58:13] they know they're nothing
[58:16] and god has to even work on us who knows
[58:19] we're nothing
[58:20] to keep us in that place
[58:24] amen he has to can he has to deal with
[58:26] our hearts within these things
[58:28] think of this this is why the scripture
[58:31] we understand
[58:32] it is always within uh the direction and
[58:35] the admonition of the holy spirit that
[58:37] we
[58:38] would stay humble
[58:41] this isn't you and me calling ourselves
[58:44] humble
[58:45] but a humbleness of mind means a long
[58:48] opinion
[58:48] of oneself it doesn't mean degrading
[58:51] self it means
[58:52] not putting self up here
[58:58] hallelujah it's putting off she
[59:01] here is esther she's got she's standing
[59:04] now
[59:05] with the courage now she's come to a
[59:08] place
[59:09] think of it think of this now many
[59:11] others could come to that door
[59:13] to come into the court but the guards
[59:16] would have forbid him
[59:18] the guards would have looked at him and
[59:20] said uh you can't come in here
[59:23] and yet to not be summoned by the king
[59:27] is death but you see
[59:30] this is a time for the for the queen
[59:34] to make her entrance
[59:38] they do not withhold esther from going
[59:41] in but now after
[59:43] she goes in but she goes in clothes with
[59:46] that royal
[59:47] apparel oh brother she's got
[59:50] substance of his unmerited favor
[59:56] unmerited favor
[59:59] and when the king look at verse 2 and
[1:00:01] when the king saw esther the queen
[1:00:04] standing in the court that she obtained
[1:00:07] favor in his sight she already have
[1:00:11] favor
[1:00:11] but notice think of this now of where
[1:00:14] the queen the king himself
[1:00:16] was standing there and he's wanting the
[1:00:18] queen to come into this position
[1:00:21] he'd been wanting her to come into this
[1:00:24] position
[1:00:24] and he sees her standing in his court
[1:00:29] oh what he must do to the heart of the
[1:00:32] lord jesus
[1:00:33] when the message that he has sent has so
[1:00:36] moved the pride and courage to where the
[1:00:39] bride
[1:00:39] comes into the courts of the king it is
[1:00:42] where
[1:00:43] she comes here not because she's worthy
[1:00:46] she comes here
[1:00:47] because the blood has gone before her
[1:00:50] a man and she has the token that is
[1:00:53] going there
[1:00:54] to make that petition to make that
[1:00:57] request it is a divine assurance
[1:01:03] and the king the bible said held out to
[1:01:06] esther
[1:01:07] the golden scepter that was in his hand
[1:01:10] esther drew near and touched the top of
[1:01:13] the scepter
[1:01:16] then the king said to her what will thou
[1:01:19] queen esther
[1:01:23] and one is thy request it shall be
[1:01:27] even given thee to the half
[1:01:31] of the kingdom
[1:01:35] i just can't help but think about
[1:01:38] here she is standing here and the
[1:01:41] courage
[1:01:42] that has moved within her heart by the
[1:01:44] word
[1:01:49] our faith let me just touch on this just
[1:01:51] a moment
[1:01:53] our faith is to grow
[1:01:57] and our faith does grow
[1:02:00] it even grows within every
[1:02:04] uh every promise that is given
[1:02:09] and this of the word of how
[1:02:12] that god would come through his word
[1:02:15] it is just like how that he approached
[1:02:18] john
[1:02:19] on the isle of patmos when john
[1:02:22] was there and here beholding
[1:02:26] his glory and the angel of the lord
[1:02:29] they're present
[1:02:30] and revealing and moving there there
[1:02:33] with john
[1:02:34] and notice the bible talks about how
[1:02:36] that when
[1:02:37] he came and he and john sees him
[1:02:41] and he falls at his feet as dead but the
[1:02:44] bible said he put his right hand
[1:02:47] upon john and he said fear not the right
[1:02:50] hand
[1:02:51] is power and authority
[1:02:55] he's letting john know this revelation
[1:02:57] of jesus christ
[1:02:59] it is to let us know there is nothing to
[1:03:03] fear
[1:03:05] i have bore your judgment
[1:03:08] i have bore the wound of sin
[1:03:12] i have absorbed the full amount of it
[1:03:15] and there is
[1:03:16] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:03:19] which are in christ jesus i your
[1:03:22] judge had become your attorney
[1:03:26] what's he doing he's ministering to john
[1:03:29] love
[1:03:30] courage and ability let me just tell you
[1:03:32] this right now
[1:03:33] before john can go on to receive
[1:03:37] the furtherance and the unfolding of his
[1:03:39] coming
[1:03:40] and all the way down through he first
[1:03:42] has got to believe
[1:03:44] and to recognize that indeed he is the
[1:03:47] resurrected christ
[1:03:49] the victorious one and he has to be able
[1:03:52] to receive it
[1:03:56] you can't receive anything unless you're
[1:03:59] made ready
[1:04:00] to receive it and so god himself
[1:04:04] the right hand of god the power of god
[1:04:07] it moves down upon john the authority oh
[1:04:10] my
[1:04:11] it takes a hold on john i'm glad that
[1:04:13] his word
[1:04:14] it lays in authority it'll arrest every
[1:04:17] thought
[1:04:17] it'll give strength to you and i you can
[1:04:20] look at yourself and say
[1:04:21] i'm not worthy and the devil can point
[1:04:23] out every one of your mistakes
[1:04:25] and every one of your failures what must
[1:04:27] happen the right hand of god
[1:04:29] comes brother and you've got authority
[1:04:32] to rest
[1:04:33] in his touch and he
[1:04:37] ministers listen notice he touched me
[1:04:40] and he ministered fear not
[1:04:46] hallelujah he come to minister
[1:04:49] love courage
[1:04:52] and ability
[1:04:57] brother brown would say it like this he
[1:04:58] says what he was telling john
[1:05:00] i've not come to bring fear
[1:05:04] and failure
[1:05:07] that is not what the right hand of god
[1:05:09] comes to do
[1:05:10] the right hand of god comes to release
[1:05:13] fears
[1:05:14] hold upon a life
[1:05:17] remember to minister love courage and
[1:05:20] ability
[1:05:21] it's the same way that when daniel was
[1:05:23] praying and i don't have
[1:05:25] have time but you know over and over you
[1:05:27] find from daniel 9 to daniel 10
[1:05:30] of when there are times here that daniel
[1:05:33] the bible says
[1:05:34] in daniel 9 the first three verses when
[1:05:36] daniel begin to understand by the books
[1:05:39] brother that's the hour that you and i
[1:05:42] are living in
[1:05:44] god has caused us to understand he has
[1:05:47] sent
[1:05:48] that of the prophet right here among us
[1:05:51] the same spirit of god
[1:05:53] that came that sent the prophet notice
[1:05:55] he come to identify
[1:05:57] this is the time this is the hour that's
[1:06:00] what mordecai
[1:06:01] was doing for esther he was letting her
[1:06:04] know get your sword out of your
[1:06:06] sheath come on somebody
[1:06:11] take your sword out it ain't decoration
[1:06:15] it's to be used it's the only part of
[1:06:18] our armor
[1:06:19] that is offensive
[1:06:23] hallelujah he's encouraging her
[1:06:26] to take it out and when he would come to
[1:06:30] daniel
[1:06:31] even right there in daniel remember even
[1:06:33] as he starts to speak to daniel
[1:06:35] over and over gabriel would tell him oh
[1:06:38] daniel greatly be loved of the lord
[1:06:43] i'm coming he'll say in a different in
[1:06:45] another place he says
[1:06:46] in daniel 10 he says i'm come now that
[1:06:49] you might receive skill
[1:06:50] and understanding and that you might
[1:06:52] receive even these things that would
[1:06:54] come forth
[1:06:55] even in the latter times concerning your
[1:06:57] people and come that you might receive
[1:06:59] this
[1:06:59] understanding daniel thou art greatly
[1:07:02] beloved of the lord
[1:07:04] let me just say this to you you want to
[1:07:07] know if he loves you
[1:07:08] he has revealed himself to you
[1:07:12] he deals with our hearts he deals with
[1:07:15] our lives
[1:07:19] i know that there are there are times
[1:07:21] where the devil
[1:07:23] he will take somebody's life maybe
[1:07:25] they've been around this message
[1:07:26] they've been in church they've been in
[1:07:28] places and then he gets them
[1:07:30] and he so traps them into decisions
[1:07:34] that they have made in their life
[1:07:37] and he wants to take those decisions and
[1:07:39] he wants to try to take that
[1:07:41] and put the person's head in the sand
[1:07:44] and say there is no way that could be
[1:07:47] talking about you
[1:07:48] but what you need to look at is the word
[1:07:51] that is calling to you it is the love of
[1:07:54] god
[1:07:54] it is not calling to all of the darkness
[1:07:57] all of the failures
[1:07:59] he's calling to the real person on the
[1:08:02] inside that's hidden beneath that old
[1:08:08] nature
[1:08:10] the devil allures traps the people
[1:08:14] into doing those things
[1:08:19] you know on all sorts of life that's
[1:08:21] been lived
[1:08:23] see this is why i'm talking about the
[1:08:25] touch of almighty god
[1:08:28] there's many can set in a meeting and
[1:08:30] don't feel
[1:08:31] nothing
[1:08:35] we're living in that day right now
[1:08:38] where people can come and sit in a
[1:08:41] meeting and they're not
[1:08:42] even touched why
[1:08:45] because the spirit of god is lifting
[1:08:49] from the earth
[1:08:51] the door of mercy is about closed
[1:08:57] and it shows the hardness of sin
[1:09:01] that can so separate a life
[1:09:04] and how many times when i you know talk
[1:09:06] with people different ones
[1:09:08] you know and you come to find out well i
[1:09:10] don't know how god could even love me
[1:09:12] and
[1:09:12] i don't know you know i've done this and
[1:09:14] i've done that and everything else
[1:09:15] and there's been years of things to
[1:09:17] where the devil will point out all of
[1:09:19] that but i'm telling you all it takes is
[1:09:21] a
[1:09:22] moment of surrender to the hand
[1:09:25] that is touching you
[1:09:30] you wonder what's that first two believe
[1:09:33] thou art
[1:09:34] greatly beloved of god
[1:09:38] to act upon his promise you've got to
[1:09:41] believe
[1:09:41] i'm greatly beloved of the lord
[1:09:46] this is why look
[1:09:49] here comes mary here comes mary to the
[1:09:53] well
[1:09:55] right the angel of the lord knew her
[1:09:57] pathway
[1:09:59] he knew her daily routine get up drink
[1:10:02] coffee at 7 30 in the morning
[1:10:04] then go he knew her routine and he met
[1:10:08] her
[1:10:08] right there in her daily routine
[1:10:13] listen when he spoke to her hail mary
[1:10:17] thou art highly favored of the lord she
[1:10:19] hadn't done one thing yet
[1:10:23] she hadn't even heard the message yet
[1:10:26] but that's the first words of the
[1:10:28] message thou art
[1:10:30] highly favored
[1:10:33] blessed art thou among women she had not
[1:10:37] even received the life in her womb
[1:10:39] she was already blessed why when does
[1:10:42] our blessing start
[1:10:43] our blessing it comes from that in god
[1:10:47] blessed we have been blessed with all
[1:10:50] spiritual blessings in christ jesus the
[1:10:54] blessing is not
[1:10:55] something that just starts in time or is
[1:10:58] temporal
[1:10:58] it is that which is released from the
[1:11:01] eternal
[1:11:01] and comes down upon our lives
[1:11:07] what are you saying i'm telling you
[1:11:08] esther it's not by chance
[1:11:11] that you're here
[1:11:12] [Applause]
[1:11:16] to recognize this is not something you
[1:11:18] climbed up into
[1:11:20] this is what you have been ordained to
[1:11:22] and the spirit of god
[1:11:24] has called you
[1:11:29] amen this is the kind uh to be able to
[1:11:32] stand
[1:11:33] in this measure to recognize with this
[1:11:36] perfect love
[1:11:37] pulsating in our heart we've got
[1:11:40] boldness to stand in judgment
[1:11:43] confidence because we've already
[1:11:46] passed under and through the judgment of
[1:11:49] our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:11:52] the witness of the holy ghost makes it
[1:11:54] real in our hearts
[1:11:58] and we have this because as he is so are
[1:12:01] we in this world
[1:12:04] we love him because he first loved us
[1:12:08] these things that i that that we are are
[1:12:11] mentioning here
[1:12:12] uh even of this morning this
[1:12:15] is what brings a strong hand to faith
[1:12:21] it doesn't matter how much of the word
[1:12:23] that we know
[1:12:25] we've got to believe it and believe
[1:12:28] that it is for us and to believe that
[1:12:32] god
[1:12:33] has qualified us to take that word
[1:12:36] and to move and act upon it
[1:12:40] this is where i look at the scripture
[1:12:42] and i read you one of these
[1:12:44] last week but in songs song of solomon 2
[1:12:47] 14
[1:12:48] look at how solomon speaks to that of
[1:12:51] the bride
[1:12:52] watch how he speaks to her oh my dove
[1:12:55] he calls her that three times in this in
[1:12:57] this in this uh
[1:12:58] book oh my dove thou art in the claps
[1:13:02] of the rock she's hidden
[1:13:06] who is she my dog he sees the reflection
[1:13:10] of his life in her
[1:13:13] what is that his victory
[1:13:17] in the sacred places of the stairs
[1:13:21] she's got access
[1:13:24] where a king inside of his palace
[1:13:28] a king had ways to escape
[1:13:31] that nobody else knew about they were
[1:13:34] secret passages
[1:13:38] she is standing in these passages
[1:13:43] she is here in a place of access
[1:13:48] he has given to us access ask the father
[1:13:51] anything and my name and i will do it
[1:13:54] and the bible is very clear as it moves
[1:13:58] within it
[1:13:58] let me see thy countenance let me see
[1:14:01] your face
[1:14:03] let me behold it let me hear thy voice
[1:14:06] for sweet is thy voice
[1:14:07] and thy countenance is comely and notice
[1:14:11] he he he speaks of this again in
[1:14:14] in song of solomon six verse nine my
[1:14:17] dove
[1:14:18] once again my undefiled
[1:14:21] is but one she is the only one of her
[1:14:24] mother
[1:14:25] she is the choice one of her that bear
[1:14:27] her the daughter saw her
[1:14:29] and blessed her yea the queens and the
[1:14:32] concubines they
[1:14:33] praised her who is she my delf
[1:14:37] the undefiled one
[1:14:44] oh god this
[1:14:47] is seeing ourselves as god sees us
[1:14:52] who is she that looketh forth as the
[1:14:55] morning
[1:14:58] a new day fair is the moon
[1:15:02] she's not a dark moon
[1:15:06] she's not a quarter moon it's a full
[1:15:08] moon
[1:15:10] it's fair as the moon clear
[1:15:13] as the sun and terrible as an army with
[1:15:17] banners
[1:15:18] this is the reflection of his life
[1:15:21] in her it's the reflection of his life
[1:15:24] in us
[1:15:26] see this is why this is why we have to
[1:15:29] rely
[1:15:30] upon what god has made us
[1:15:35] jesus relied upon the word said he was
[1:15:40] that's how he fought he fought because
[1:15:42] he relied on what the word said he was
[1:15:46] this is why the scripture said if our
[1:15:48] hearts condemn us
[1:15:50] then we can't have faith
[1:15:53] you see if you know you're doing things
[1:15:56] wrong
[1:15:56] automatically you put yourself out as a
[1:15:58] sinner you see automatically there's
[1:16:01] condemnation
[1:16:03] amen esther
[1:16:06] had to be able to put on the royal
[1:16:10] apparel
[1:16:14] let me just say this to you this is
[1:16:17] where a time
[1:16:18] even is that for lives who have not been
[1:16:22] quickened with the holy ghost
[1:16:23] it's a time to recognize that listen
[1:16:27] if our heart condemn us we can't have
[1:16:29] confidence
[1:16:31] i don't care if you look back and you
[1:16:33] know you're doing things wrong
[1:16:34] and you know that you still love the
[1:16:36] world those those things that you say
[1:16:38] i can't get rid of this habit let me
[1:16:40] tell you something there is
[1:16:42] power in the blood of the lamb
[1:16:45] this message never revealed to us
[1:16:48] a weak christ it's revealed a victorious
[1:16:53] christ brother that's what's been
[1:16:56] revealed
[1:16:58] hallelujah that's who took the seals off
[1:17:01] of himself
[1:17:02] is the mighty conqueror he
[1:17:05] conquered the seen world and the unseen
[1:17:08] world
[1:17:12] and for those lives
[1:17:15] i'm talking to esther even those lives
[1:17:19] where god has fully placed the crown
[1:17:23] upon your head you know that the work
[1:17:26] you know that the love of the world
[1:17:28] is no longer there in your life you know
[1:17:31] that he has become alive
[1:17:33] within your heart and the love of god is
[1:17:35] shed abroad in your heart
[1:17:36] but yet it brings us to an evaluation
[1:17:41] esther had an evaluation
[1:17:45] she just didn't haphazardly just take on
[1:17:48] you know
[1:17:49] the royal apparel and throw it on and
[1:17:51] say well yeah i've got the royal apparel
[1:17:54] she got before god and examined her life
[1:18:00] let me preach a little bit matthew
[1:18:04] 6 is where the angel of the lord
[1:18:07] spoke to the prophet when he came to
[1:18:09] talk to him
[1:18:10] about the third pull which would be the
[1:18:13] opening of the word
[1:18:14] the placing of that word into
[1:18:17] a bride body and when he came to that
[1:18:21] and said i'll meet you
[1:18:22] in there remember the people walked in
[1:18:26] with all sorts of conditions but
[1:18:28] whatever condition they went in
[1:18:31] some were on cots some were on
[1:18:32] stretchers some had you know
[1:18:34] uh uh the the uh crutches these were all
[1:18:38] things
[1:18:38] visible that we could see visible
[1:18:42] healing but it was talking about
[1:18:45] something much
[1:18:45] deeper than visible healing he was
[1:18:48] talking about
[1:18:50] spiritual healing
[1:18:53] that's the real healing revival because
[1:18:56] if a person gets healed
[1:18:57] in their body they can get sick again
[1:19:00] but when that soul
[1:19:02] has ever received the cure
[1:19:05] from sin disease brother that soul
[1:19:09] can never ever be sin sick no more
[1:19:12] that's the manifestation of the son of
[1:19:15] righteousness rising with healing in his
[1:19:19] wings
[1:19:21] and it culminates in the catching away
[1:19:25] that culminates his rising it culminates
[1:19:29] in a catching away
[1:19:32] but it brings you and i to an evaluation
[1:19:37] and this is where it really causes us as
[1:19:41] a people
[1:19:43] to evaluate are there things that we're
[1:19:46] allowing
[1:19:47] to be hindering in our life
[1:19:51] let me just say some some things to how
[1:19:53] the devil wants to look
[1:19:55] the bible says tear down every
[1:19:57] stronghold
[1:19:59] it also says give no place to satan
[1:20:03] come on paul wasn't writing that to
[1:20:05] unbelievers paul wasn't writing that to
[1:20:07] make believers
[1:20:08] that was to the ephesian age that was to
[1:20:11] the ephesian believers that was their
[1:20:13] letter
[1:20:13] don't give no place that means quarter
[1:20:16] room
[1:20:16] castle retreat what are you saying don't
[1:20:20] give no excuse
[1:20:24] you see in order for the word to operate
[1:20:27] i'm talking about to this point
[1:20:29] it causes evaluation where even
[1:20:32] indifference has got to be cast out
[1:20:36] grudge has got to be cast out but just
[1:20:38] to remember
[1:20:39] as we looked at this some thursdays ago
[1:20:42] this part
[1:20:42] is sticking but we ain't making no
[1:20:45] excuses for it
[1:20:47] that means when it's sticky we've got to
[1:20:49] have a power on the inside
[1:20:50] to get to get it unstuck
[1:20:54] there's things we have to search deep
[1:20:56] within our lives
[1:20:57] and i'm not talking about like going
[1:20:59] through mystery i'm talking about
[1:21:01] to where we recognize that there are
[1:21:03] certain things when it comes down to
[1:21:05] promises
[1:21:06] that you recognize holding on to certain
[1:21:08] things
[1:21:09] certain feelings and hurts and
[1:21:11] everything else you begin to realize
[1:21:13] what is it that causes you to recognize
[1:21:16] those things are no longer worth it the
[1:21:18] love of god
[1:21:21] that has to be the love of god that
[1:21:24] causes you to recognize
[1:21:25] this means nothing
[1:21:33] brother let me tell you god ain't going
[1:21:36] to strip him out of us
[1:21:37] that's where we've got to take our that
[1:21:39] initiative
[1:21:40] before we can put on that royal apparel
[1:21:43] and begin to go in you're taking
[1:21:44] promises
[1:21:45] it's holding that sword in your hand
[1:21:48] it's got to be clear
[1:21:51] if your conscience is not clear get it
[1:21:54] clear
[1:21:56] is that right brother branham's standing
[1:21:59] there in the message i think it's life
[1:22:01] is the healer
[1:22:02] one of those messages were healings in
[1:22:04] the title that i'm listening to
[1:22:06] and brother branson said now you come to
[1:22:08] the end of it he said now here's what i
[1:22:10] want you to do he's talking about how
[1:22:11] that that god it cannot override you've
[1:22:13] got to have love in your heart
[1:22:15] he said now look he said right now let
[1:22:18] everything be settled look how simple
[1:22:20] this
[1:22:20] is he said let it be settled he said
[1:22:22] maybe you say brother branham i've been
[1:22:24] a little skeptical of you
[1:22:25] he said but right now you just say
[1:22:27] brother branham i love you
[1:22:28] father forgive me he said let god ride
[1:22:31] right in
[1:22:32] now it isn't about oh that's that simple
[1:22:35] it's
[1:22:35] that simple to release a burden
[1:22:41] it's that simple satan's job is to try
[1:22:47] to conglomerate because if he can
[1:22:50] conglomerate
[1:22:51] the sword stays in the sheath
[1:22:55] but where to take the sword against him
[1:23:02] now let me just kind of move here over
[1:23:04] this
[1:23:07] esther invites the king
[1:23:11] and she wants haman to come with him
[1:23:15] she wants him who's the problem come
[1:23:18] with the king
[1:23:22] i want you i want you all to come she
[1:23:24] has a banquet
[1:23:25] and they come now when she comes to that
[1:23:29] remember that banquet esther herself
[1:23:31] comes
[1:23:32] and i want you to notice the approach
[1:23:34] that she makes
[1:23:35] with the king she invites that he
[1:23:38] and haman would come again right
[1:23:42] now look what's happening haman has come
[1:23:46] here
[1:23:46] and haman's like boy this plot
[1:23:50] i've got it sewed up he don't know he
[1:23:54] ain't sewed up he's being set up
[1:23:57] you see he see haman starts getting a
[1:24:00] false confidence
[1:24:03] i love it when the devil starts getting
[1:24:05] the false confidence
[1:24:07] at about that time he's in for it
[1:24:11] he had him against the red sea false
[1:24:14] confidence
[1:24:17] amen and that double devil he's stealing
[1:24:20] never learned his lesson
[1:24:21] if he fakes the devil glories and if he
[1:24:24] can get somebody pinned in
[1:24:26] to a corner that i've got him i've got
[1:24:28] him hemmed in
[1:24:29] that's exactly what he wants to do
[1:24:36] he already knows it but i go and say it
[1:24:38] you're set up
[1:24:41] this message has come to unfold the word
[1:24:45] it's god unfolding the promise to set
[1:24:47] you up
[1:24:51] what glory be to god notice our esther
[1:24:53] she says
[1:24:54] in verse 3 of esther 7. i want you to
[1:24:56] watch this approach
[1:24:58] esther says if i have found favor look
[1:25:00] how she comes to the king
[1:25:02] humility if i have found favor
[1:25:06] in thy sight o king and if it please the
[1:25:10] king notice
[1:25:11] in thy sight the king sees
[1:25:14] what nobody else sees his
[1:25:18] sight sees to our heart
[1:25:21] if our hearts condemn us his sight sees
[1:25:26] o king if it please the king notice this
[1:25:29] is about the king
[1:25:31] let my life be given at my petition and
[1:25:34] my people at my request
[1:25:36] for we are sown i my people to be
[1:25:38] destroyed to be slain
[1:25:40] and to perish but if we had been sold
[1:25:43] for bond men
[1:25:44] and bond women i had held my tongue
[1:25:46] although the enemy could not
[1:25:48] counteravail
[1:25:49] the king's damage then king of hezrus
[1:25:51] answered and said
[1:25:53] unto esther the queen who is he
[1:25:59] i want you to call him out esther
[1:26:03] i want you to name that devil
[1:26:05] [Applause]
[1:26:06] i want you to speak the word i want you
[1:26:10] to call his name out
[1:26:15] like brother eddie biscuit he talked
[1:26:17] about that man how many times
[1:26:19] we've heard that testimony brother eddie
[1:26:22] said that's the first time the biblical
[1:26:23] said he said that he said i learned that
[1:26:25] lesson on calling out a devil
[1:26:29] he wasn't brother brandon called that
[1:26:30] devil out
[1:26:32] but what happened is his life that
[1:26:36] man made a confession i'm free
[1:26:40] when the devil is uncovered brother he
[1:26:43] has
[1:26:43] no place to hide that's what real
[1:26:46] confession does
[1:26:47] and that's why the devil gets nervous in
[1:26:50] meetings
[1:26:53] that's why he gets nervous that's why
[1:26:55] the prophet said standing right here
[1:26:57] he said when the spirit of god begins to
[1:27:00] discern those things he said that's why
[1:27:01] you see
[1:27:02] changes come over people's countenance
[1:27:05] he said because he knows
[1:27:06] his scheme is about to be revealed
[1:27:10] to the person think about this the truth
[1:27:13] comes to reveal the lie
[1:27:17] and when the truth comes and the truth
[1:27:20] uncovers the enemy
[1:27:21] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[1:27:25] shall make you free
[1:27:36] i don't know how many young people last
[1:27:37] year byc working with them right up
[1:27:40] there
[1:27:40] devil possessed and working with them
[1:27:43] to get them to a place and that devil
[1:27:46] them devils are standing right there
[1:27:48] talking
[1:27:48] and right over top of it and getting
[1:27:51] them to a place
[1:27:52] to name that devil
[1:27:56] and you start praying and all of a
[1:27:58] sudden the spirit of god begins to
[1:28:00] move within that right there brother
[1:28:02] satan can't hold
[1:28:04] when hearts begin to unite with that
[1:28:06] word
[1:28:12] who is he where is he at
[1:28:16] where is he at that
[1:28:19] there's that that dirt's presumed in his
[1:28:22] heart to do so
[1:28:23] notice what the word is doing it's
[1:28:26] revealing
[1:28:31] i can't help but think of god of this
[1:28:33] evil age and the prophet just stands
[1:28:35] there and said
[1:28:36] now he said how lucifer's heart about
[1:28:38] this
[1:28:40] it reveals his plan
[1:28:44] the adversary and the enemy is this
[1:28:47] wicked haman
[1:28:49] you've got to name the troublemaker
[1:28:55] come on now you got to name him then
[1:28:58] notice the bible said
[1:28:59] haman was afraid before the king
[1:29:03] and the queen
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:07] the queen has spoken and remember
[1:29:11] he ain't afraid of my word or us
[1:29:14] but he is afraid of the one we represent
[1:29:18] and in the presence of the king the
[1:29:21] queen
[1:29:21] has been brought into his presence
[1:29:24] brother
[1:29:24] and here in his presence to announce
[1:29:27] that
[1:29:28] and to claim that and say this wicked
[1:29:30] haman
[1:29:34] not well my daddy had this problem my
[1:29:36] mama had this problem my granddaddy had
[1:29:38] to know
[1:29:39] that wicked haman
[1:29:43] brothers so and so sister so and so my
[1:29:45] wife my husband no
[1:29:47] that wicked haman
[1:29:52] she's in the presence of the king
[1:29:56] this is why you've heard these
[1:29:59] statements that brother branham
[1:30:00] he will make this is why the devil is
[1:30:02] howling
[1:30:04] that's why he's howling the way he is
[1:30:06] you know what his howling is
[1:30:08] it's the yoking up of the ecclesiastical
[1:30:11] realm
[1:30:12] that's his howl his how
[1:30:15] is bringing his ecclesiastical realm
[1:30:19] together
[1:30:21] but the bride has been brought together
[1:30:24] by the shout
[1:30:25] out we're not brought together
[1:30:28] by this by satan's how we've been
[1:30:31] brought together
[1:30:32] by the shout of the king
[1:30:35] victory by that of his voice sounding
[1:30:39] and turning our hearts around
[1:30:43] that's the reason he's he's howling his
[1:30:45] scheme has been uncovered
[1:30:47] think of this statement we've got the
[1:30:49] we've got the devil's answer
[1:30:52] not me that liveth listen to this not me
[1:30:55] that liveth but christ the word
[1:30:58] living in me it's not my idea
[1:31:02] it's his power not my idea
[1:31:06] it's his word he promised it
[1:31:09] here it is he said it would be here and
[1:31:11] here it is
[1:31:12] we got his answer
[1:31:16] standing justified in the presence of
[1:31:20] almighty god
[1:31:22] we have that witness the blood was shed
[1:31:26] the life
[1:31:27] has come amen the life has come
[1:31:31] in ministering redemption to our life
[1:31:37] but samuel how do i know that i'm fully
[1:31:39] redeemed
[1:31:40] when your sins are demolished you see it
[1:31:44] you've accepted it your sins are
[1:31:46] demolished
[1:31:47] it's separated from you the love of god
[1:31:51] is what burns in your heart
[1:31:55] that's satan's answer
[1:31:58] remember jesus conquered with the weapon
[1:32:01] of love
[1:32:05] that's the weapon that we use
[1:32:08] that weapon of love that of taking that
[1:32:11] sword
[1:32:12] of the word that's the answer to the
[1:32:14] devil's question
[1:32:16] this is why in the meeting when the
[1:32:19] spirit of god
[1:32:20] as he comes and begins to reveal his
[1:32:22] word and he's revealed to be the same
[1:32:25] yesterday today and forever that is why
[1:32:28] the prophet can announce
[1:32:30] when that is taking place doomed devils
[1:32:33] are on the run
[1:32:37] they're doomed why because the
[1:32:39] resurrected christ
[1:32:41] is making himself known that he's the
[1:32:43] same yesterday
[1:32:45] today and forever
[1:32:50] haman stood up
[1:32:54] where's he going he's going to esther
[1:32:56] making requests for his life
[1:33:01] because he knew the wrath of the king is
[1:33:04] upon him

[1:33:12] back into the house
[1:33:14] and when he comes back in he finds haman

[1:33:59] the romans
[1:34:00] he said the god of peace shall bruise
[1:34:04] satan
[1:34:05] under your feet shortly
[1:34:08] we're living in that hour where a bride
[1:34:11] is standing
[1:34:13] upon this earth it's not the feet not
[1:34:16] the thighs
[1:34:16] it's not that of the torso it's not the
[1:34:19] neck
[1:34:20] but brother that of the headship has
[1:34:22] come to the body
[1:34:24] like ezekiel's bones that life has come
[1:34:28] to the body

[1:34:37] he knows he has a short time
[1:34:43] brother samuel why does it seem like i
[1:34:45] am fighting battles
[1:34:47] like i never fought before the devil's
[1:34:49] howling
[1:34:52] come on now he's wanting to fall across
[1:34:54] there on the bed
[1:34:57] but the king comes in and the king

[1:35:44] that haman
[1:35:45] let me tell you when haman starts rising
[1:35:48] is when you start
[1:35:49] thinking that let the bible say let
[1:35:52] every man take heed
[1:35:54] thinking he stands lest he fall
[1:35:57] let every man not think more highly of
[1:36:00] himself
[1:36:00] than he ought to think
[1:36:03] what is that amen
[1:36:10] oh glory i'm talking about hindrances
[1:36:14] haman was hanged on the gallows
[1:36:20] let me just have a few moments here and
[1:36:22] i'll just bring this to a close
[1:36:25] here esther after heyman is hanged
[1:36:29] she comes to address the king again i
[1:36:32] want you this is what i want you to
[1:36:34] catch
[1:36:35] once she's went in and stood with the
[1:36:37] royal apparel on
[1:36:40] she keeps coming she keeps coming
[1:36:44] faith is growing she keeps coming
[1:36:47] she keeps requesting promise after
[1:36:50] promise
[1:36:51] after promise after promise what's
[1:36:53] happening her faith is increasing
[1:36:56] but how is her faith increasing love
[1:36:59] love is increasing she listen to me now
[1:37:04] she has already received the unmerited
[1:37:06] favor
[1:37:07] of the king he has already expressed his
[1:37:11] love
[1:37:11] to her let me just say it like this
[1:37:14] you've already been
[1:37:15] sealed with the love of god shed abroad
[1:37:18] in our hearts but for our faith to grow
[1:37:22] our love must grow as well and how what
[1:37:26] is it that our love is growing
[1:37:27] that our faith and our love would abound
[1:37:31] toward not only those within but those
[1:37:34] without
[1:37:35] come on i'm talking bible now amen
[1:37:38] you've got to if you can't love those
[1:37:40] that you see how can you love him and
[1:37:41] you haven't seen
[1:37:44] i'm talking about using the sword
[1:37:47] talking about taking promises
[1:37:50] amen we're talking about the holy works
[1:37:53] brought about by holy faith
[1:37:55] so here's esther standing again and
[1:37:57] remember esther
[1:38:00] her faith has grown into a place she
[1:38:03] listen to me now
[1:38:04] i want you to catch this what she is
[1:38:06] standing with the royal apparel on
[1:38:09] when that royal peril went on the
[1:38:11] message was calling her
[1:38:12] to live beyond herself
[1:38:16] for so many years the message has just
[1:38:18] been about her
[1:38:20] but now it calls her to live beyond
[1:38:23] herself
[1:38:24] to recognize that eternal life in your
[1:38:26] bosom is not about
[1:38:28] you it's for this
[1:38:31] calvary to be expressed through you
[1:38:35] so here she comes with the royal au pair
[1:38:36] you look from that moment on
[1:38:40] esther chapter 5 revelations
[1:38:43] chapter five come on somebody what is
[1:38:46] she doing
[1:38:47] no longer living for herself
[1:38:52] she's living even to where now sure she
[1:38:54] is making another request
[1:38:56] another request ah the king
[1:38:59] my people are still under the threat
[1:39:02] even though haman
[1:39:03] has been has been delivered but my
[1:39:06] people
[1:39:06] are not prepared against the day of
[1:39:09] judgment
[1:39:11] what is esther doing she's making a call
[1:39:14] of mercy get prepared
[1:39:18] judgment is coming
[1:39:21] she has been given there mordeca is
[1:39:24] given there
[1:39:25] the king's ring with the seal to write
[1:39:29] letters for what so the jews can
[1:39:32] arm themselves and prepare
[1:39:35] against judgment that's what the
[1:39:39] ministry
[1:39:40] through the pride of jesus christ is a
[1:39:43] ministry
[1:39:44] prepare for judgment
[1:39:49] hallelujah you're anointed to stand
[1:39:52] in this hour
[1:39:56] for a people that have looked for the
[1:39:59] promise of the rapture
[1:40:00] brother it has been announced this is an
[1:40:03] hour
[1:40:03] we're not announcing it's an hour to say
[1:40:06] we
[1:40:07] have arrived this is the time
[1:40:10] not for making promises is the time for
[1:40:13] fulfilling it
[1:40:15] rahab rahab what was rahab doing when
[1:40:19] she received that word
[1:40:20] now go get your family
[1:40:30] see the love pulsating in the heart
[1:40:33] you see what's giving her courage the
[1:40:35] love of god is so overwhelming her life
[1:40:39] this is where the love of god being so
[1:40:41] shed abroad in our hearts
[1:40:42] brother when the love of god is just so
[1:40:44] shed abroad in our hearts
[1:40:46] and remember the bible says in the book
[1:40:47] of jude keep yourselves in the love of
[1:40:50] god
[1:40:51] it shows we can get dry
[1:40:55] we can get dry we can get complacent the
[1:40:58] prophet would say
[1:40:59] like this when you fall out of love when
[1:41:01] you separate from divine love you can no
[1:41:04] longer overlook your brother's mistakes
[1:41:08] this is why the love of god
[1:41:12] dwelling in the love of god this is
[1:41:13] where esther is at brother the sword
[1:41:16] is out
[1:41:20] it's promises now that are being taken
[1:41:27] love of god is so pulsating and so
[1:41:30] moving through her heart
[1:41:33] she's dashing out there
[1:41:38] for others this don't have anything to
[1:41:40] do about her
[1:41:41] it's about others let me just say to you
[1:41:45] it's not just about those out here
[1:41:46] outside
[1:41:48] it's for those right here as well
[1:41:51] as brother brown would say let us take
[1:41:53] that weapon of love that he left us with
[1:41:56] and dash into sickness let us
[1:42:00] dash into where the devil's had holds
[1:42:04] let us dash into it
[1:42:07] and it is also for there are also others
[1:42:10] out there
[1:42:12] there are also others out there that
[1:42:15] they need to see the love of god
[1:42:19] this is why that the holy spirit would
[1:42:22] speak to us
[1:42:24] through the message of the prophet and
[1:42:27] he would let us know
[1:42:29] he said when you go to talk to that
[1:42:30] loved one
[1:42:32] you go to talk to the other one he said
[1:42:34] apply the token
[1:42:36] go with love and consideration
[1:42:40] let me just let me just give a little
[1:42:42] bit of counsel here
[1:42:45] as parents and to to parents
[1:42:48] as parents you've got the dual role
[1:42:52] you've got you've got you're looking at
[1:42:54] moses and joshua as a parent
[1:42:56] we're moses we've got laws
[1:43:00] we've got restrictions we've got things
[1:43:03] we set down by the word of god
[1:43:06] we can't do what joshua does
[1:43:10] there comes to an end of our point come
[1:43:12] on now understand what i'm saying
[1:43:14] where we are at we have to give
[1:43:16] direction we have to set boundaries
[1:43:18] we have to say nope this can't be
[1:43:20] encroached upon this is why
[1:43:22] we tan hides this is why or how whatever
[1:43:25] you do
[1:43:26] that actually gets the point across
[1:43:28] somehow another it's got to come forth
[1:43:30] like a rod
[1:43:30] but however that might be it still comes
[1:43:33] into a place
[1:43:34] joshua is the one that has to take them
[1:43:37] over
[1:43:39] so applying it with love don't mean like
[1:43:41] well it's without any restrictions or
[1:43:43] any hold
[1:43:43] that's not scriptural that's not
[1:43:46] scriptural
[1:43:47] we want to be scriptural jesus said i've
[1:43:50] not come to do away with the law i come
[1:43:52] to fulfill it
[1:43:54] is that right it takes joshua to bring
[1:43:56] us in
[1:43:58] it takes joshua to bring our children in
[1:44:01] but we have a responsibility moses
[1:44:04] brought him to that place
[1:44:06] all the lord working it's all god
[1:44:10] working are you with me
[1:44:13] this is where as we come into that place
[1:44:16] it
[1:44:17] moves us with the sword of the lord
[1:44:20] these are things of promises and i think
[1:44:24] how that god has taken it just like in
[1:44:27] the first parts of this here
[1:44:29] and it's like he's taken it and kind of
[1:44:31] moved the move back the curtain
[1:44:33] and helped us to see this has to be
[1:44:35] taken
[1:44:36] by love
[1:44:39] it comes down first of all that we abide
[1:44:42] in his love
[1:44:46] recognizing you're chosen of god
[1:44:49] you're beloved of the lord what god has
[1:44:52] done
[1:44:52] in your life look you come back to that
[1:44:54] and these are this is the ground
[1:44:56] that you stand on this is why a person
[1:44:59] you got ground to stand on
[1:45:01] when the holy spirit deals with the
[1:45:02] heart it's ground
[1:45:04] so that god god will deal with that
[1:45:06] heart and call them
[1:45:07] by divine love calls them into surrender
[1:45:10] and then even coming into a place of
[1:45:12] complete surrender
[1:45:14] and how god steps and moves to the
[1:45:16] inside you realize that's the ground
[1:45:17] that esther was standing on
[1:45:20] then the crown you know the seal
[1:45:23] in your heart and so you stand there
[1:45:26] with that seal of the living god
[1:45:30] that's how we're wielding the sword of
[1:45:32] the lord
[1:45:34] if there's any anything with
[1:45:35] condemnation anything at all
[1:45:37] anything that that in the conscience is
[1:45:39] troubled cleared out
[1:45:41] clear it out amen get it under the blood
[1:45:43] and i'm not just talking about
[1:45:45] just you know the same old thing if
[1:45:47] there's things where you look in your
[1:45:48] life
[1:45:48] lord i need to be set free i need to be
[1:45:51] delivered
[1:45:52] be honest with him call out haman
[1:45:55] amen call out haman
[1:45:59] bring it let haman come to where the
[1:46:00] blood's at
[1:46:03] hallelujah there's power in the blood
[1:46:07] amen let's pray father
[1:46:12] we love you lord this morning
[1:46:16] oh god we look lord
[1:46:20] in how we can so identify
[1:46:23] in our lives even though lord it would
[1:46:26] not
[1:46:27] perhaps record or has not said it in
[1:46:30] that manner in the book of esther but
[1:46:32] yet we realize
[1:46:34] the lord even though esther was abiding
[1:46:36] there in the palace
[1:46:38] she had the crown that was seated upon
[1:46:41] her head
[1:46:42] she already had the royal apparel
[1:46:46] this no doubt was not the first time
[1:46:49] that she had
[1:46:50] had the royal apparel on
[1:46:54] i would say as the scriptures would
[1:46:55] portray it it's the first time
[1:46:59] where this royal apparel is adorned
[1:47:05] lord she's coming to approach your
[1:47:07] throne
[1:47:10] of a situation
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:13] lord god that is upon her
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:17] upon her people she's moved lord
[1:47:24] how is she standing here how are we
[1:47:27] standing here
[1:47:29] it's by your love love that's been
[1:47:32] expressed
[1:47:33] and received into our hearts but how
[1:47:37] that
[1:47:37] how is our lives daily
[1:47:41] lived to be lived to take the promises
[1:47:44] of god
[1:47:46] recognizing lord that it's not because
[1:47:49] of our worthiness
[1:47:51] the lord jesus you have made us worthy
[1:47:56] we have been accepted in the beloved
[1:48:01] lord god is the scriptures
[1:48:04] would clearly speak to us we have been
[1:48:07] made the very righteousness of god in
[1:48:09] christ
[1:48:10] lord i ask for every everyone
[1:48:15] every one of us lord may your word
[1:48:18] be made more real to our hearts
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:21] may it be made more real to our hearts
[1:48:23] may we oh god
[1:48:26] not try to reason it out
[1:48:30] because certainly if we lord
[1:48:33] we try to reason and out we get to
[1:48:35] looking at our at ourselves we get to
[1:48:37] looking at
[1:48:38] everything lord that the enemy would
[1:48:39] want to try to point out
[1:48:41] we would never stand the lord jesus
[1:48:44] we're standing upon your word
[1:48:48] word that is not outside but the word
[1:48:50] that has been placed within us
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:54] i pray lord this morning may every one
[1:48:57] lord take courage
[1:48:59] or whatever their need is this morning
[1:49:04] maybe it's lord a load of sin that
[1:49:06] they've been carrying
[1:49:08] maybe lord in their life those that
[1:49:10] would stream it lord
[1:49:11] archive maybe there's things lord that
[1:49:15] they're just at the point to say lord
[1:49:18] i'm ready to name this haman to come
[1:49:21] into your presence
[1:49:23] to invite the king to come for a banquet
[1:49:27] of wine
[1:49:29] perhaps lord is esther standing today
[1:49:32] saying lord there's things that have
[1:49:36] allowed to remain and it's hindered
[1:49:40] the word from being operative or
[1:49:43] operating
[1:49:44] from taking promises
[1:49:49] lord i want the love of god to abound in
[1:49:51] my life
[1:49:54] this is our desire lord that your love
[1:49:57] would abound that our faith
[1:49:59] would grow lord
[1:50:02] it's a relationship as husband and wife
[1:50:06] with you lord i pray lord
[1:50:10] as we see this with esther
[1:50:13] lord it didn't fade she didn't fade back
[1:50:16] out of the picture
[1:50:18] but esther continued to make requests
[1:50:21] clear to the very last scriptures
[1:50:26] where even though haman's sons
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:30] were slain with the sword the jews armed
[1:50:34] themselves
[1:50:35] with a sword and they slew the enemy
[1:50:39] lord i think when i look at this how
[1:50:41] esther's standing in this moment
[1:50:43] i think of how your prophet would tell
[1:50:45] us that one person
[1:50:47] one person in a church on fire for god
[1:50:51] would do more for that church than
[1:50:53] multitudes of revivals
[1:50:56] one person on fire for god
[1:50:59] lord jesus i believe with all my heart
[1:51:03] lord god
[1:51:05] i believe lord as we see that with
[1:51:07] esther
[1:51:08] it caused the jews to gather themselves
[1:51:10] together they armed themselves
[1:51:13] or those that were against them they s
[1:51:15] they slew them with the sword
[1:51:17] then even of haman's sons after they had
[1:51:19] slew
[1:51:22] esther's desire was let them be hung
[1:51:24] even after they've already been slain
[1:51:26] let them be witnessed publicly hanging
[1:51:31] let it be a witness that haman's
[1:51:33] household
[1:51:35] it's past oh lord god
[1:51:40] let that be the desire lord that so
[1:51:42] moves within our hearts and our lives
[1:51:46] let it be lord god in my life let it be
[1:51:48] in my heart let that be the prayer
[1:51:50] lord god for each and every one of us
[1:51:52] lord
[1:51:54] let it be in my life let the fire of god
[1:51:57] burn
[1:51:57] so bright in my life let it burn lord
[1:52:00] god
[1:52:01] with such fervency lord that other
[1:52:04] hearts
[1:52:05] might be warned and encouraged
[1:52:08] lord let it grant it lord for each and
[1:52:10] every one i pray
[1:52:14] lord jesus like esther
[1:52:18] may we not pull back that sword
[1:52:21] keeping it keeping it out lord taking
[1:52:24] promises
[1:52:26] we ask it lord now in the name of jesus
[1:52:29] christ
[1:52:31] amen you're oh my
[1:52:35] don't you love him oh my
[1:52:38] don't put the sword back keep the sword
[1:52:41] out

[1:52:45] at promises

[1:53:43] measureless
[1:53:46] and strong
[1:53:50] it shall forever

[1:54:08] the way that he

[1:54:20] just no more to

[1:56:37] read
[1:56:38] and you come into that latter place it
[1:56:40] all had a start

[1:56:46] when it came time for her
[1:56:51] that she began to take
[1:56:54] what what hey hey hey guy the king's
[1:56:57] chamberlain
