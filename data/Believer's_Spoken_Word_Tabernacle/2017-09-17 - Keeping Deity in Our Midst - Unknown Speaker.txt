[Music] we'll be on that name never had sermon [Music] [Applause] ready [Music] you [Music] [Music] there's a toddlers will be missing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] haloo hey man what a precious promise you know I think of it many times that down through the time Paul spoke of this it was already in God's mind and Paul spoke of it and they have waited on this for the ages they have preached that we're living in the day where it's not just going to be preached that's prophecy it's coming to pass it's you know I stand I think about it many times where we're standing and you know you you pinch yourself sometimes you think Lord you know you look at how that but the venom says if I could have chosen any time to live I would have chose this time and we know this I've said this many times and perhaps you have - it certainly isn't because of the condition of the world not at all but it's because of God and what he's doing through his word I'll tell your friends if it wasn't for that we would not be able to stand in this world but it's God Himself who made a promise that when the enemy comes in like a flood I the Lord will raise the standard against amen how we thank God for His mercy don't you Amen let's stand and we want to go right into word this morning I know they gave the announcement already I want you to go to Exodus 17 if you would please they gave the announcement already this morning about the prayer meeting this coming Tuesday and we're just going to postpone that till the following Tuesday we'll get a memo out about that make sure we remind you but they're coming in tomorrow for the carpet and everything to lay all that over a couple days period of time and so finally have that arranged so let's just remember remember that the prayer meeting there will move that to the September 26th and we also need strong young men we've got a couple pews that need to get put in here after the service nobody said amen not just young men we need strong I will call no names I'd also like to meet with the brothers right after the service as well as well so also we sent out an email I think it was last week and it involves you have some upcoming dates in there and I apologize that that didn't wasn't getting out to you over the time of the summer I know many of you you've kind of make plans and preparations based on some of those things and just try to keep you abreast of things so that you're able to make plans and so forth I'm not the greatest and remembering to make announcements here these papers that I have I've had to stick them so that right on top my notes because if they don't go on top my notes we forget about it and so I have to put them right here in front of it and we try to get those out and just to make you aware of that even in October as well as in November where we have some things that are coming up as well special events if you don't happen to get the email we can get that printed off for you just see sister Rosanna see sister Michelle they can get all that printed off for you if you happen to need it to post it so let's read here in the word you hungry this morning amen Exodus 17 verse 8 then came a Mallick and fought with israel and referee and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out and fight with Emily tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand I want you to catch that you're not just gonna stand there empty-handed but he's standing with the rod of God in his hand not down in the valley he's gonna stand on the hill they're gonna fight in the valley but he's gonna be on the hill they're gonna be in a place where they're gonna be in battle but he's gonna be visible before him so Joshua did as Moses had said to him fought with Hamrlik and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that he is real prevailed and when he let down his hand Amalek prevailed you see that parallel when the hand is let down with the rod of God then Amalek prevails but when the hand with the rod of God in it is lifted amen when it's let down Israel is being defeated but when it's lift the Israel is prevailing and Moses hands were heavy that's a reality isn't it Jesus never said that the walk of a Christian would be easy he never said go take up your fruit basket and follow after me but he said take up your cross not my cross he had his cross but you take up your cross and sometimes he gets heavy but this is the next part and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on there's a place where you can rest on when it gets heavy there God has a place of rest it didn't just happen and say hey hey can y'all bring a stone up here no there was a place already provided like when Moses was having you know the time and and the Lord said here's a place beside me Moses come stand beside me so it took a stone and put it under him and he set thereon and Aaron and her stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the one on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun so there was somebody there to keep his hands up somebody was there to keep the route of God up in the air the Amen hallelujah Joshua discomforted emilich and his people with the edge of the sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the years of Joshua but I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven and Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi where he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with Emily from generation to generation amen let's just look to the Lord in the word of Prayer precious Heavenly Father Lord we want to say that we we love you more we would just ask the Lord that here father in the midst of the time as we are Lord giving ourselves Lord to the Word of God Lord we ask the Lord that your precious Holy Spirit Lord father you who are the word yourself that you will come Lord and all God guide and direct us Lord father in your word this morning that Lord it is not just something that we see but father you show us how that we might apply it Lord in our lives Oh God so we ask the Lord in all things that you'll be glorified Oh God we pray this morning Lord God that once again Lord as according to your word may Amalek be discomforted Lord God father by the edge of the sword Lord we pray as the hands are lifted up Lord and the sword going forth Lord may you have preeminence or God here in our midst Lord and fulfill and accomplish your word Lord to minister to every need we pray now in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you you may be seated let's look here just for a moment in Exodus chapter 4 if we could I I want to go and I want to look here a little bit on the rod of God now we see here in exodus chapter 4 verse 1 here's Moses he sees he's come aside the Lord has already been speaking to him concerning the promise and Moses and verse 1 answers and said Behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto Him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod Moses already knew what he had in his hand but God is now wanting to show him what he has in his hands that it is more than just what he has been carrying around so he's at when God asked the question it's not that we would instruct him God asks a question and it's it caused us to think to consider who do you say who do men say that I am NOT that they would tell him he wants them to think who do men say that I am where are we who do you say that I am well is this the time of the end sirs it's a question so what is that in that hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground now notice this take what you have in your hand cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee I I think it's beautiful in the word he says the rod became it the rod itself became from just that of a rod that Moses had walked around with and undoubtedly this was a rod that was fit for a shepherd it was a rod that was fit to herd sheep it was a fitting fitting tool but Moses was not aware of what was actually there within his hand but there's no one that can make him aware of it nor could it become to the potential as it can in the presence of God just carrying that rod around he herded sheep but now in the presence of God it becomes more than just a tool for herding of sheep now in the in in the presence of God this is made known as something that is able to come forth and it's able to swallow up it's able to transform from just a rod to become a serpent serpent representing what sin it's able to become from a rod to that of sin what is this whole the whole transition here in Exodus for this is the great condensation of God coming down and coming right among us God Himself holy righteous and now God coming that one who has led us one who has watched over Israel one who has guided one is a great Shepherd of the flock but now he comes down and he comes down to do what to take the curse of sin upon himself and in the midst of the situation we know down in Egypt God God doesn't let him know what's going to take place down in Egypt that you're gonna be confronted with Jennie's and jamberries they're gonna throw down their rods and they're gonna become a surface god doesn't let him know that but their God doesn't need to let him know that one only thing that Moses it's necessary from Moses or any of us is that we meet God face to face and that it becomes the not just a promise but it becomes a living reality to us then it becomes that which is more than a match for anything that the enemy has that's the confidence we have and here in the midst of that time the rod became and that raw they're standing in Pharaoh's Hall that rod became and when the rod became its swallow the other serpents the other serpents had no power over that rod the others had rods but they didn't have this rod it's not just to have a rod it's to have this rod there was something different about this rod it wasn't the kind of material that was made out of it was what was laying inside of it Oh glory it's what it represented what was laying inside of it and there in the midst of Pharaoh's Hall oh my how that we can see this in the life of the Lord Jesus death is swallowed up in victory this rod could lead about sheep but this rod until it come here in the place of the Prince of God there was no deliverance to the children of Israel but once it come into the presence of God this rod became a tool in the hand of Moses and what did it do it brought a deliverance to the people of Israel it was God moving sovereignly what's this how the Prophet places that in this great servant Moses 1955 he said as Moses went with the judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is Jesus Christ if those Egyptians could have ever got that little simple stick out of Moses hands they'd have had him whipped if they could have got that little simple stick out of his hands they'd have had him whipped and when the devil listen to this now and when the devil can never get the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ he's got the church whipped it's not just a rod it takes the deity of Jesus Christ in the church and that's what Satan has been after all the way down through the ages is to take the deity they meant to take the life of God from the Church of the Living God because when the deity of Jesus Christ is present in that name demons tremble there is nothing to stand before that word this is what Moses was holding that day his hands were lifted in the air the rod not the rod of Moses the rod of God Moses said I'll take the rod of God oh my I'll tell you what the hands of Moses God used him when there were plagues down in Egypt and where they rose said pray that these things be taken away Moses said I'll lift up my hands to the Lord and pray that these things will be taken away Moses went out lifted up his hands and God removed those plagues from the Egyptians hey man it wasn't just God God was using just even that of hands but it was that that which is lifted up unto the Lord that word that has now become substance hands being action hands been doing hands being divine application amen amen this is what we want to I want to look at here this morning keeping deity in our midst keeping deity in our missus a solemn charge to keep deity in our midst notice when you think of even how the charge that were given in in in Exodus in the token time where it speaks of how that the blood is to be applied and how that we are to eat that lamb and we're to eat it where our loins are girded Peter said good up the loins of your mind amen let our mind let our loins be girded about Paul said in Ephesians 6 with truth gird about with truth the Prophet takes it over and over and he says if you feel like you're getting a little slack tighten up reach down and get the buckle and tighten up the buckle amen notice and shoes on your feet which just sung that song and there's gonna be a meeting in the air shoes on your feet when you watch them and what was going on there was a readiness about their lives what brought this readiness they were under that prophecy which is unfolded into its final moments and stage it brought a readiness that prophecy being unfolded in its in its finality what does it do it brings a dressing to wear that they are dressed and ready for Exodus that's the focus of the word and they were to eat it with your staff in your hand they meant year to have what God done remember what God does in the messenger what God does through him the way that that life is lifter him is to also be live through each and every one of us amen so here a staff in your hand a staff in your hand in your home on your job in your life in your office staff in your hand as Moses stood there on the mountain that day and his advances hands grew heavy but yet there were those who were around Aaron could stand as a priest and lift up the hand Harris standing there lifting up the hand he had a place to rest and his hands could be lifted up oh you know what that speaks off this was speaking prophetically that man in himself there is a weariness and man that man can get weary but it speaks that when God would do a complete final work on the inside though you might grow weary there is one standing for you there is one standing inside of you at all time hey man it is Christ Himself who is standing in the midst of your life hey man at the end of this age we find there's one that mighty angel that descends in Revelations 10 his hands both hands are up to the air they met what is at the rod of God the deity of Jesus Christ amen not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now the person of Christ Himself setting in the midst of the church what is it the rod of God amen the judgment of God amen aren't you glad for the judgment of God hey many comes with jets in comes to deal with it he comes the answer the same question what does that the deity of Jesus Christ they're just at the name of Jesus Christ they're teaching this teaching this teaching this be a better person here be a better person there be a better person there but the deity of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ he cleans up alive it straightens out a lot it gives a lot power within it because it's a prevailing power hallelujah greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world the deity of Jesus Christ remember from Deuteronomy 25 verse 17 God he not heal God wanted Moses the otic said if we wrote it and we read it an extra - 17 but God's making sure Moses don't you forget this you get this wrote down aren't you glad God don't forget aren't you go ahead aren't you glad God didn't say I forgot I'm gonna have to bring the messenger back no I forgot I wasn't even thinking about the hour we're gonna be living and I wasn't even considering all these laws and things are going too fast God didn't leave nothing out but when the moment is needed he opens our eyes that we can see glory and there's already been a prayer of intercession that's bait Lord calm this man's fear there's more with us than there is against us what was that that's the same voice of Revelations one he said he had failed out but he put his right hand upon me one right hand it's a power authority what's in that right hand the seven stars of God that revelation of Jesus Christ he had put it upon me and said rise up John fear not what did he come to do there in Revelations one Minister loved courage and ability glory be to God by what by his power not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord this mountain shall be removed notice Deuteronomy 1217 remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when you were come forth out of Egypt how he meant me by the way and smoke behind most of the even all that were feeble behind thee when thou was faint and weary and he feared not God you see God gods kept the detail on it amulet did not come at the front he came to attack not just the back but what was weak he came to attack that which was feeble Satan is an opportunist that right he he will try to get one that singled out you understand what I'm saying you can come to set right here and he singled you out yet you're in the middle of a congregation is that right because you're singled out in your mind single out in your heart come on friends yeah you can you can me in the midst of a group of people walk down Walmart the mall Target wherever you want to go you can walk in the midst of there I've been in the midst sometimes a multitudes of people I feel so alone you miss me verse 19 therefore it shall be when the LORD thy God hath given the rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven thou shalt not forget it God remembers and he takes account of this approach you don't read this you don't read this of the other nations like this you don't read this but God lets him know when you come over in the land everything is settled you've got rest I want you to go after a Mallick I don't want nothing remaining of him I want everything removed you know what God is saying here he is prophesying of what he alone is able to do hallelujah when God speaks his word I'm telling you brother and sister if we think that we can take the word and do something about it we are mistaken but God speaks his word that you and I might come to that place to say Lord I need you Lord to accomplish this Lord I need your power your grace your spirit Lord Lord I can't do this on my own but does that purposely why because it didn't is left to you and I through our call to say Lord this is what you said Lord I'm incapable of fulfilling err but Lord Jesus you have spoken and Lord and father I'm looking to you to provide what's needed what are you asking for a deity a God to come down into the rugs amen the deities are coming to the rod Oh glory be to God in the highest hey man the deity of Almighty God not just a name but the deity as God told Israel when you go through the land he said when all nations shall see that you're a people that's called by my name yeah you see this how God presents this very thing right here - to saw in 1st Samuel 15 here is Israel's come to a place remember they they they're fulfilling prophecy what God spoke in num and Deuteronomy when you come into the land you're gonna see how all the other nations have kings and you're gonna want to start to be like them you see it's important that you remove things from your eyes they're right I won't ask you the question but I don't think anybody any of you if you do you shouldn't you don't drive we're looking backwards why what do you look forward you gotta see where you're going it's children of God we don't look back God will bring back to our remembrance but we don't look back will it forward amen listen to me now unclean spirits look back but the Spirit of God looks forward unclean spirits look to an earthly origin but the Spirit of God knows he come from God going back to God hey man were not that of unclean spirits that look for earthly origin dies it's the Spirit of God will let onward he saw he picked out head and shoulders above all of them this guy's a good guy man nice-looking church ooh head and shoulders above everybody he was the people's choice and God gave them according to their choice God will not force his way and got and got through sandal now listen this here is Samuel one whom God hath revealed himself to in Shiloh by his word they're right here as Samuel was the word of the Lord the gift not not only is Saul anointed but here is leadership after the anointing you must follow what the Prophet says do are you ask me to have the anointing and not follow what the Prophet says do is to question what is beneath the anointing come on friends him and anointing is not wrong but it's what is beneath the anointing what comes forth where does it lead to what does it lean to the right and the message rapture the Prophet says when the Holy Spirit falls upon that cell and it takes off to a denomination that is a denominational anointing it's the genuine Holy Ghost but it's what's down beneath there that's why the deception in this hour were people said I'm born of the Spirit I've got the Holy Ghost the Spirit filled but yet here's what is it on the inside isn't lining up of the word a show that punctuates every word of God with an Amen right remember the Prophet said over and over Pentecost there is where you failed he said it into earlier messages and all the way to the ladder in why it's a deeper walk than just a sanctified life the Holy Ghost produces sanctification but it's a deeper walk that's why the Prophet said how can overcome people is it good people can live above adultery live above all these other things and still not with it it's about the love of God in your heart I think God for good clean moral people but friends I'm talking about a rapture I'm that call just to make good clean moral people the deity of Jesus Christ will do that are you with me the probably tells us over and over he said if it did it there among those natives in Africa if that same Holy Ghost coming down there did it there he said it'll do the same thing in the United States why the Spirit of God is the Spirit of God glory be to God you love him Athene friends this is a remedy this is a remedy the deity of Jesus Christ but deity having that life on the inside that's the remedy look at sin look at Saul here Saul you know he goes up and he's following everything I'm gonna read all of it but he goes up and he tells that there you know the the the Kenites in verse 6 he tells them you know get out from among their malachite you know we didn't we don't we're not we're not after you guys right now we've we don't want that we unless we destroy you because why he knows he's got a charge the charge wasn't Amalekites and Kim and and Kim tights it was a malachite God is precise on his charge we'll get to the Kim tights we'll get to those fights we'll get to those things but right now it's the Amalekites you know why because Amalekites this is the representation of that which is born after the flesh are you with me now now notice how saw this man is troubled in his spirit he goes to reasoning he's got the word of the Lord but now he starts reasoning with me he starts looking at it and saying yeah let's get rid all the diseased ones let's let's get rid of all them let's keep those that are good and I'll tell you what we'll do with them well bring them back here and we'll sacrifice um unto God that sounds good but that's death to keep anything that God has said get rid of it to keep it is death Saul doesn't realize but this very decision that he's making is going to remove the kingdom from him what he's showing within he's not worthy to have it all friends let our hearts be tender let our hearts be tender let it be that if there's anything that is not like him at all say God take it out Lord Lord remove it from me oh my friends let me tell you something you don't have to wait to an end of the service you can receive power right there you can receive deliverance right there healing right there they met have there's something that's wrong reach out and take a hold of God and say God you're speaking to me Lord let Daddy fall in the rod this morning Lord but they're to come in this rod Lord God if your hands have got heavy it has gotten weak if it's gotten down say Lord lift me up Lord God David said when my heart is overwhelmed Oh lead me to the Rock lead me to the rock that is higher than I they meant David knew what it was like to get hated Devon knew what it was like to have fear and he said let me come rest under your wings Oh God let me find a place there Oh glory be to God friends let me tell you something if there was a bomb that was coming and there was news as that was going on right now there would be everyone would be seeking for shelter let me tell you something the shelter that God has provided in this hour is not a bomb shelter made out of concrete but the Bible is clear it prophesied of this hour that in this day unmad shall be as a cover a man shall be as a shelter that man is none other than Jesus Christ amen he is our refuge he is our hero when you and I resort to glory glory glory sandy took verse eight and he took a gang the king of the Amalekites alive Wow and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword I don't know what was going through Saul's mind I don't know what was going through his mind but it's got to be pretty evident that there had to been some kind of dialogue or something going on here something affected Saul's heart come on somebody but it affected it in such a way of deception to where when he returns back to Samuel he's coming to Samuel said I have done all that the Lord has spoken that means that I hear your words but I hear something in the background and what I'm hearing is is disobedience what I'm hearing is is chosen rebellion what I'm hearing is is you're doing Saul what you want to do but he destroyed all the rest of the other people all of them notice verse 9 said but Saul and the people spared a god you know it's important to look at these words this word spared means to half pity or compassion on I'll tell you this sometimes that's one of the biggest hindrances to the gospel is pity that's one of the biggest hindrances to things is human compassion yell with me the pool of siloam the place that of bethesda right House of seats of mercy seats of mercy and here the Lord Jesus comes walking down there in the midst of all of those who are sick the Prophet tells us Jesus stepped over water had babies he stepped over some to a cancer ridden you know the Prophet dramas I say God allowed us to have eyes to see into the word in this hour so what so that it would direct this innermost being because if it would us with oh oh and not that we don't have compassion listen friends I'm not talking about hardness but this compassion the Prophet said that when Jesus walked down through there it wasn't human compassion it was compassion according to the will of God that's a big difference human compassion wouldn't have done nothing there remember Jesus was a man so we can't say he don't know how I feel no he knows how we feel he knows when we're tempted in compassion right he understands those things but notice brother Graham said this man about 30 he said now the scriptures of 38 years old he said the man for I had a prostrate prior I always say wrong prostate condition nothing big they put it like this this guy maybe let's say let's say he had a problem with his leg couldn't walk right you and I would say this guy or this one was the cancer this was a leg hey let's go after this row here the cancer this guy can live he can get around on that leg this shows God don't look at things the way we look at it you understand clotting wasting time friends but Saul and the people spared a gag and the best of not just sheath the best of dispirited and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs in all that was good who said it was good come on somebody who said it was good what's he what's he comparing this to well it's a better sheep compared to that no no no no no no no no no it's compare these sheep with the word are you with me compare this sheep with the word let me tell you friends this is how serious this is it removes Saul and took the kingdom from him to allow things to reside and remain in your life can remove you from the rapture you say remove me from the rapture yeah you can be right on track but perfect love perfect love is to reign within your life how the Prophet came back from beyond the curtain of time he said I can never long longer be the same william branham that i was he didn't get born again again but that became even more real more precious more valued let me tell you something friends yes I would love to look beyond the curtain of time I would love to be able to you know looking and see my dad but you know I don't need to do that to have a faith because this faith that God brought and delivered right through the message in this hour that revelation it has brought heaven down so real it is me Christ so real that is made Christ tangible it has brought him down to where he's now standing in Bride form to I can shake hands with my brother with my sister and I can see Christ being unveiled amen to get a foretaste of heaven to get afar taste of glory as his presence sweeps in among us strengthens us and charges us by his deity of his life so he kept certain things I want you to the heart has taken to this quote the Lord just directed me here upon this and that's what I begin to deal with me very familiar place for many of you that following the message but it's a word of admonition to the church in Christ as the mystery and the Prophet says it like this he said brother Neville goes through many strains and heartaches that he doesn't show it here at the Tabernacle but being that the Lord lets me have a little sight into people's live I know what he goes through a whole lot of it see and he certainly goes under a lot of labour and strings and things and you people here hold him up like Joshua and Caleb held at the hands of Moses as he's bringing the word so I ask you how do you hold up my hands if I'm your pastor how do you hold up my hands do you are you there you know at my house you know you guys take turns and we're gonna rotate people in I'm just trying to make it simple as God will bring it to me how are my hands held up here is the are my are my hands held up because what brother Sam you know he's a he's a funny guy I like being around brother Sam you know you kind of lightens things up that's not that's not holding up my hands you you may not our personalities may not mesh real well but yet you can still be holding up my hands you understand friends I mean it's just the truth I mean maybe not all of our personalities but God God brought us together you know why because we need that from one another we need that from one another God knows I got greenness in my life and that greenness has got to get baked out I'll save for amen for you too well has it got to do it it's got to be light shining through and hold somebody who's got to be light so where is it Jesus said ye are the light of the world Amen it takes that where that word being preached in the world bringing maturity that's why real truth fellowship with one another is so vital and important that fellowship around the word is so important I fellowship that fellowship with ministers and honor on a thing here and I'll tell you what things it just challenges my heart very good as we look at many different things challenges me I love that it challenges me when I sit down talking with different ones here within this assembly how not friends it's not about what you can quote what you can say I don't care what you can quote that one that is that I want like to see that word being lived that's what beats in my heart is that word that's being expressed and that word that's being lived the matter if you can quote an exact quote with the Prophet said or quote this scripture put that down that don't impress me I'm not looking for that I can quote the quotes I can quote the scripture but it's about that life that's being lived it's a testimony that's held up what is it it's deity of Christ inside of the rod that says here's alive here's a trophy here's a victory here's a testimony here's one I don't hold up the hands of my pastor I tell you just told you letting the deity of God reign in your life letting the word have preeminence in your life the word that's being ministered the word that's being preached let it have three minutes in your life until your friends just being associated with this church is not letting the word have preeminence in your life yes sir then associated with this message is not letting the word have preeminence in your life it's got to become one with you you've got to become one with it but Johnny in heaven a shotgun wedding in this time Johnny has no shotgun ready God ain't bringing no body appearance and you're gonna get married to me right now he's got old and new the whole Bible's a brand new book but he ain't having a shotgun wedding he ain't gonna pull push rod he calls the Bible says that in this hour Ephesians 1:11 he will gather all things unto himself and the gathering of the people shall be unto him how do I hold up the hands of my pastor look at Ephesians look at the book and look at the book of Ephesians here Paul comes among them now yet Paul is standing there we know a messenger they oppose also tending there among the people and Paul here he is looking and he deals with something that they could look at and it don't seem as deep as the first few chapters but it's home life Paul I thought she was going to talk about the seventh seal this morning I am I'm bringing the seals from just a writer I'm bringing it down to your life what is it it's a message of application what's he doing he's bringing the deity into the word the deity into the rod he there's a home life they they needed admonition on how to operate a husband and wife or one maybe they were bad it's just they needed a little bit of admonition who could maybe we'd have to pick this one up next week as well there's a whole lot tucked in here too but he dealt with those things why was it because he recognized if this isn't dealt with God made him aware of it if it's not dealt with and everything else that he has ministered on in a chapter one chosen and God and Christ before the foundation well if these little things what is called little things are they're not dealt with then that expression cannot come forth correctly so everything is important remember remember if the Egyptians could have just got that simple little stick hmm but to you who know it's not a simple little stick this is the rod of God so it's how we're looking at it how we're gonna value it gives it a simple little stick or is it the rod of God your view will determine how you handle it your hand if your knee wrecking that you're valuing it as the rod of God because the deity of Christ is there within it you value your life Val your actions value behavior value what you think I'm talking about holding up the hands of the pastor hoping to say I pay my time I'm talking about holding up the hands of the pastor come on friends I talk about holding up the hands the pastor there's a lot of churches all the way down through here all the way over they've got good taxpayers in them they benefit from that principle in the world that ain't a message principle that's a scriptural principle the message being a scriptural message picks it up and says this still applies the right the people benefit from it because they applied the money principle whoo glory be to God but I'm talking about holding up the hands of the pastor holding up the hands the bastard telling what a great guy he is if you don't got my number I'll give it to you so you could text me nothing what I'm looking for were friends then they need at all you know I've had people that have come here and said I'll tell you what man it's the best thing in the world my goodness those kind of people scare me cuz I know it's only a time it's only a period of time you said brother Sam you are not think that I'm friends listen I'm just looking at what patterns have been if God leads somebody to come here they better be led to come here because they're gonna see a lot of they're gonna see humanity they're gonna see a lot of thing but they gotta recognize it was not coming here because of a personality have come here be closed off the ladder and Christ has led me here what would come now change this little bit change that change this I would change that change that someone would come I don't buy a car and say you know I'm by this car but no paint just here and paint that there I don't like this here why you buy you're gonna pay into paying more money it'll cost you more it'll cost you a lot friends if you're just looking for a trench to change this here change that there change that there why cuz you're looking at changing so many other things that's you ain't looking at the most important thing and that's where the word to change you name em what we talking about Badia t in the name of Jesus Christ men are Samuel you're human I'm reminded of that every day every day I'm reminded of that and brother Doug especially after I preached a while I'm reminded of it the next day but also in the book of Ephesians he also told her put away bitterness is that right he didn't say well you know you're just praying you know he said you put it away what you need to look back and recognize where you come from there is authority in recognizing who you are recognize who you are what's he doing is calling their attention to things that would seem so simple and little but can hinder the handling of the rod or just situation my hands are getting heavy sit down on the stove I've got some ministering of the work that'll lift your hands up the right The ministers wired is sent to encourage us that our hands be lifted up what are your hands you're doing your life what is in the hands when God speaks of it visitation down the egypt and delivering by mighty hand what is it it's God personifying his dissension down in humanity how do I hold up the hands of my pastor hmm what is a good one who maybe way to preach 50 parts on this one you understand what I'm saying here you recognize this ain't about me what I'm saying is if you look at and say well what no Sam you're trying to do you know what brother Bram talking about here you know holding up the hands of my pastor what one brother brems are talking about so much as far as the man what brother Ram is dealing with is so that the word that God desires to deliver doesn't become hindered are you with me God's interested in keeping channels clog-free God set Drano before they ever invented it yes sir God since then by his Spirit to do I clean up clogs cause clogs cause things to back up the water ain't meant to do back up in the sink and back up in the signal the water his men as you're washing that the water is running down and it's taken the contaminants with it that's what a real life doesn't submit it to God that has a heart that says Lord train me Lord God if there's anything in me at all transit holla me Lord God let the deity of Almighty God move down and cleansing out in my life if there's something in my landlord let it be cleaned out why I don't want to keep washing my hands in the same stuff over and over I want it to be washed away with the washing of water by the word what does that the rod of God handle I hold up the hands of my pastor in Galatians Paul Cheema mother Paul he's seen where there were those who came among them and Paul you know Paul had a way of putting things you know what I mean Paul didn't just call everybody brother am I wrong am i right well said men false brethren in Jude chapter 1 certain men not brethren certain men crept in unawares God identifies that friends listen Paul wasn't saying nothing that wasn't identified you understand me this wasn't slander slaying put down he's simply identifying when God identifies things it's to put the church at rest why because it lets them know I've already known this they're right here comes in men this is the thing that you look at these things these guys came into Galatia they didn't care about the people they didn't care they came right among the people and started telling them you gotta go back you got to do this you got to do that you got to keep this you got to keep that your righteousness is and this your holy what are they doing removing them from the revelation that PAH has delivered to them that's your righteousness he's in Jesus Christ by the righteousness of God dwelling in you and you in him by the love of God that's what Paul could bring it around in Chapter five faith worketh by love and Paul deals in Galatians and lets him know you're not gonna conquer Amalek with your strength is that right the flesh lusteth against the spirit the spirit against the flesh he's letting them know a Mallick the flesh cannot be conquered by your strength and your might and you say well Paul I'm baptized in the Holy Ghost Paul said then if you live in the spirit you also should walk in the spirit see notice what he's telling he's applying those things not just living in it but walking walking means your life is conducted under the leadership of the Holy Spirit what you're doing he's taking what they have come in and they have made light of the rod as a simple little stick buzzer oh no no no no no this gospel this revelation that I delivered to you it is a simple little stick it is the revelation of Jesus Christ hey that's prevailing power within it Amen is that right I don't hold the hands of my pastor up Paul even dealt with it in the book of Corinthians you know we could spend many times in many of these places Paul dealt with it in the book of Corinthians they were elevating men why they had such a concept of man that you know as we said done before in it's it's it's time to be thankful for the vessels I'm thankful for every gift of God translucent I'm not just on my ministry I'm thankful for every believers life and I really mean that with all my heart but to see how that there were things that were moving among that was removing the deity away from the rod of God to wear that even it's reported Paul said it's reported among you that you're going in there and you're getting drunk it's made Facebook friends I don't say that to be funny but I'm telling you that's how Facebook was there that's how it would have been the community knew and Paul was letting them know you're bringing a reproach on the name of Jesus Christ that's what he was letting them know see what it is they're there they're failing to recognize now here here he comes right back around to do what he's bringing them back to the real truth of what communion is how the reference of their life Paul deals with how they're to keep their temple how do the Reverend said how they're to look at and notice he even takes a time the Spirit of God Christ first Corinthians and second Corinthians he causes them to reflect and consider that you are not your own you're bought with a price what's he saying that you don't have no right if you've been redeemed you forfeit your choice are you with me now he's letting them know he would be done he's bringing they're faking and consider that new you not your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost has let them know your life is to be filled with that deity glorify God therefore in your spirit and your body which belong to the Lord is that right he dealt with them on the gifts how they were miss handling the gifts they were just looking at these things and taking them lightly they had him in their midst but Paul said I sold unto thee a more excellent way oh I love that he didn't say I tell unto thee I show why because what Paul was getting ready to speak I was a witness it was an image living reality of this I shown to you a more excellent way what's what's he doing he's admonishing them my hands are coming down keep my hands up what what God has delivered keep it up what's he telling your life your lives the way you're living it's important the way your lives or what you're going about you can either hinder or you can lift up you love him Paul dealt with him that was 11 that was among them as well is that right Levin that was among that back church and they were glory and Paul said your glorying is not good is that right he told him he said there's a situation in the church and you haven't even addressed it come on somebody he's Lila he tells them you've not even taken a can of this and you're going on in glorying and groaning blood what she said he said what happened is the deity is gonna be removed from your midst God is a gentleman he will give mercy and he will give grace but his mercy and His grace is not for continuance it's that things might be resolved are you with me God spoke of those things telling men 1st Corinthians 5 let's just go on over there 1st Corinthians chapter 5 just just stay right we'll just stay right at right where I'm at over there but let's go right into the I'll just want to go right into the scripture here 1st Corinthians chapter 5 now what's what Paul is saying here in verse one now first Corinthians 5 verse 1 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you oh no Paul where's your compassionate no it's there I said it's here for verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when you are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ delivers such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus is just a word notice what Paul is saying I'm not there but I've already I've judged it what's he judged it by he says it's verse four in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's a the character the life of Jesus Christ the deity of Jesus Christ so he's letting me know you're not just getting together but in the name it's according to the word your glorying is not good no you're not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are on unleavened for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us what's out what's how what's how he goes with this purging out therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth what's the unleavened bread Christ the word what's that great feast it's the Feast of the atonement the feast of Christ the feast of that word now notice what he's dealing with verse 7 and verse 8 Paul just does not leave it to that situation that's there but Paul lets them know hey you've got a purge out you've gotta get rid of and remove miss leaven out of your mints and he goes down into the depth of it the leaven of malice your malice is injurious thinking thinking that is injurious to another you as me this is where in Ephesians were posed to let all bitterness be put away from you let all with all malice with all malice see bitterness and malice come together they're right but bitterness just does not start as just like a big blob of bitterness that's dropped it don't start that way it starts with just something that can be a stop where you think somebody's wrong are you with me I know nobody nobody probably did that this is just for the people archiving but the Prophet said when you go to think this is the same prophet of God used by the Spirit of God that said there's not a scratch on Joseph except what he said there to Pharaoh or to his dad and said hey just just you know just tell him that you are herdsmen but that I went down into the prison he went down into prison and Paul prisoner brother Ram child takes us down there it says there was pride in Joseph's life what God had showed he was true and genuine but God sought a cat half pride handling that what was it it's gonna be the rod of God in the hand of God well thanks be to God aren't you glad for the hands of God the eyes of the Holy Spirit still here among us him searching us out and minute string around to the depths of our life as I search me Oh God I'll tell you friends in this hour we need that spiritual MRI where it's moving all around in our lives passing under the word coming back passing under the word coming back let me tell you something just like any of you ever went into heaven in our MRI they tell you got your little claustrophobic some people say I'm claustrophobic what do they tell you to do hey get some music and put some earbuds on and we'll play some music for you let me tell you something there's a new song being sung you can go through this MRI it's a MRI with the song of redemption that is crying out a song of redemption that says I have overcome and you shall overcome hey man hallelujah amen look at it you see hearing that in that place he goes on he says I wrote in verse 9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then you needs go out of of the world but now I've written unto you not to keep company you know what company is fellowship that's the definition intimate discourse that which would cause continuance as though all things are ok this is what this is what the word says in Matthew chapter 18 Matthew chapter 18 the prophet in this quote I'm reading out of Christ as the mystery the Rev says you have tapes on discipline in the church Matthew 18 if there is something he said you go to your brother if your brother hath aught against you you go to your brother right a your brother will not hear you here means neglects hears that a miss doesn't take the value of it then what does it say go and take witnesses with you y'all believe this don't you we're talking about keeping deity in our midst any if they neglect to hear brother Brent says take the Deacons or you say I'm going to get my pastor and we're going to sit down and if they neglect to hear them then tell it before the church and if they neglect to hear the church let them be unto thee as or what heathen and a publican I don't got my eyes on right now I'm talking about these things so I can't see your faces I'm talking about the deity of Jesus Christ that's what I'm talking about notice it said let them be as job said thou speakest as are you with me he separated them as sheep from goats there wasn't she there it was as she from goats the ass as was very important as as the heathen in public what's the publican Republican was one who was a Jew tax collector and they were mixing around with the Romans and they weren't living up to the standard of which they were born to that's the definition they weren't living to the standard they weren't living that out and said let him be under be as a heathen and a publican the prophet takes that with this right here and the Prophet brings it right down to this place right here when we just read is in verse 5 to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus the prophet brings those two together this is Paul applying the word he's not playing and out of malice he's not playing and out of hate this is love you see love and compassion there is a love that enlarges the gates of hell there's a love that enlarges the gates of hell and there's a love that can deliver you from her steps the Bible says in the book of Proverbs they said many mighty men have went into her chamber and down her steps and they have been overcome but hearing the words of wisdom delivers you there right well what is Paul dealing Paul's let them know the deity is not where it needs to be in your midst this must be addressed let me just pause right here okay let me read you a quote sister don't don't try to find it I've got it here later in latter part in Hebrews chapter seven part one each member of the church is supposed to do that he's talking about all wars are fought for principles if you have a little war in church it must be the right principle you must be fighting for the right thing and each member of the church is supposed to do that this teaching is for the church these are these tapes he's talking about for discipline he lays this out and why we're not a denomination as well that's what I'm standing here for that's what God's Word is for it is for the church listen now listen don't never let nothing hinder this church if it does you're guilty each one of you this has got to be personal for every one person for every one if something comes into my home I take it personal if there's a need that's going on in my home I take it personal it's personal it may not be something I'm feeling or directly me but it's in the home and you and your different churches listen now if something is going wrong in your church you're guilty because you're the overseer of that church in ain't up to the pastor and ain't up to the Deacon board talking about holding up the hands of the pastor y'all still with me I'll still ready to hold up them hands in the pastor so we're all this isn't that Paul was letting them know when you all are gathered together this is body this is what Paul Ciolino here that same spirit right here when the Prophet is delivering this he says he goes in to say that that we're all responsible so when Paul is dealing with this he says in verse 11 I have written unto you not to keep company if any men that's called a brother be a fornicator covetous idolaters that's one of causing all sorts of stuff a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one what's it say what's it say with such a one do what not to eat that's mean are we looking at the word or not or are we looking at our feelings remember compassion that's just human compassion is the biggest hindrance earthly human pity is the biggest hindrance you with me it's got to come in line with God's will when it comes in line with God's will then God will move now let's just let's just clear the air on verse 11 a little bit can we do that that's okay I'll just left that hopefully the Lord let me let me go on and have some time the prophetic eyes that on earth take this in verse 11 and takes us in the message while we're not a denomination to the pastor by the name of brother Rasmussen and brother Rasmussen had a boy by the name of Wesley Wesley what an fornicator covenants idolaters maybe would have failing there but I want the drunkard or an extortioner but you know what he did he called his daddy's church a bunch of holy rollers and his daddy told him he said listen I love you and you're my daddy brother Brandon goes right through in the message he said I love you I'm your daddy he said but I will not compromise and allow you to talk about God's people that way so he said you making me choose between that and God's people and God's Word I'll stand with God's Word no he said it hurts me though it breaks my heart he said but I'll stand with God's Word Wesley he gave him a period of time he didn't get right now either said bunch of holy rollers go down there aren't you glad the Spirit of God showed us how to bring the application so he wouldn't come brother Rasmussen delivered and said this is it the brem said it wasn't until weeks months later Wesley took sick he got real sick at the point of death why because he had been released from under the protection of the blood the Prophet said as long as people are under the protection of the blood God can't deal with them listen to me the first part if you know your brother has a nought you go to him what is that that's the word God in flesh going you with me that's the mercy of God the mercy of God is the God to come down into flesh is that right God to operate in that way it won't hear you take more of God in flesh and go neglects to hear that bring the Assembly God moving through flesh there and for an agreed let's to hear that and God said because they will not take it from the veil then I take over when Wesley stood up before the church he apologized to the whole church he repented for his behavior he repented he said I shamed my daddy as a pastor I shamed Escarra Gatien I shamed the Lord Jesus Christ he's I'm asking you all to forgive me you see there had been a call to go in he was at the point of death he was at the point of death what was it God was dealing with his life now one of his daddy what if everybody from the church was a whole Wesley Wesley we want to have you back here so back if they wanted to have him back here so bad then they need to follow the letter of the word have no fellowship is this the word or not half don't don't eat now this situation here Paul dealt with it also not the same extremity of it but in 1st Thessalonians 5 there was one Paul said it was walking disorderly among the people paul said anybody that walks disorderly in other words they're a busybody we're such a 1 don't eat that's me no we're not talking about secular understanding now we're talking about the Word of God we're talking about what Paul is pointing them to as a desire if you're desiring to see as he's letting them know they're you're desiring to see this situation resolved you gotta come according to the word and your feelings and all of your compassion and pity has got to be brought under the word do you think those people didn't feel sorry for this young man and feel sorry for the situation sure they did sure they did or what's been down through the time and the ages sure they did it wasn't that they didn't but Paul is letting them know the deity of God you're at risk of it being removed from your mitts this is where the Prophet tells us he said we are trying to do it on our own so much and what he was pointing to is how there were people in that brother Brown was pointing this out he said we're not like the denominations he's the denominations get to looking at somebody saying you know what you'd be better over so and so's Church you'll be better over so and so's Church you make he says like this you make a good better Lutheran you make a better Baptists you make a better this that's what the Prophet is saying he's a but see the Scriptures looks at a situation to where God's able to move in and when the protection of the blood is removed then he said God can go to work couldn't God go to work before sure he has there's like you and me coming one to another even right here by the words coming forth to work God Himself coming right down here in flesh and speak into our lives and us one to another maybe I'll fellowship me you say brother I don't know about that or sister I don't know about sister you may you know coming to side sister I don't know maybe about this and you know how this is dress and how this is what is that that's the mercy of God moving down in reverence not just a simple little stick but it's looking at the rod of God there's a lot more depth through this here but I don't we can week week we can hit some of the other parts I'm holding up the pastor's hands but these are things that I want you to understand very clearly I want you to see it in leadership and know how to direct know how to walk know how to handle know how to move within something does heart itself as Paul is bringing this out here at that heart notice as he goes on verse 12 let me finish the chapter for what have I to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within but them that are without God judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person that sounds like Paul wicked person remember remember he's discerning the spirit from the individual that's where it takes the discernment is this all is being done - for what what did Paul say the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved looks like I was sharing with some if my boys went you know my dad boy I tell you he'd tan my hide good many times not many times a lot and the thing that I didn't I what I didn't like more what I didn't like was the nap he made me take after it hated wasting daylight I hated that worse than I did the whippin was the remove one having to go lay down in the bed and go to sleep that's gonna miss playtime now give anything for them weapons right now but I know one thing that just like even with my boys my dad sometimes he would be over the house he told my wife he said you know how to take fall or bend take him holding room I come out you know because I don't just I never just spanked him we talked told him how important this is where this is where the standards that got thrown this even before and after of course I didn't do all of a lot of that when they were really young because they probably would fall asleep but by the time I come out the room my dad be gone I didn't even get to drink the rest the coffee with him dad tell my wife you said huh I can't stand around here for this what changed what changed times he'd be over there you know when we were training the boys with certain things you know and and there's a certain time of life you know and they're getting out of certain pants and into other pants you were mom and dads I had an accident he said Pat just wash this stuff up the youth meeting still gonna be going on wash it up don't and don't you say nothing to Sammy but I say all of that within this I know that sometimes not sometimes many times dad would do that looking the other way I know it got him but I know one thing deep down he knew that after this correction is over one thing about it I'll be able to enjoy him in my house I'll be able to take him out when Kim and them let him stay here with us I'll be able to take him out and if I go to snap my finger like I did for Samuel dad had a snap about him it was different by the dominating anybody snapped it was like a certain sound I knew what that snap meant that snap meant whatever you're doing it's wrong just stop and I also knew when we get in the car from where we're visiting you will be getting talked to and the possibility brother Joey was gonna be we'll talk about this we get home further I like fellowship but I never liked that fellowship that created a lot of anxiousness I say that with this when you look at this employers dealing with these things here like this Paul realizes he's letting the church know within it he's telling them how to direct their Compassion's within it so that their Compassion's don't hinder the working of the Lord he's not saying things to be mean things to being different this will never fit with dr. Spock this doesn't fit with New Age parenting but with the deity of Jesus Christ in it it still is all powerful the Word of God still prevails the life of Jesus Christ is going on the character of Jesus Christ is going on now what if these brothers and sisters maybe they had they were working with this individual what if they ran into this individual down in the marketplace they could look and say brother or they could say sister it's your heart right with God get your life turned around with Misha get your life turned around with God raptures upon us the coming of the Lord is upon us serious about these things not rather we're having steak tonight would you like to come over sister we're having chicken tonight would you like to come over hey we're all going to be getting together for a big fellowship dinner would you no no they were applying the word keep not company eat not with one why it was the love of God but to the minds of the world that's cruel that's indifferent but there's a purpose there's a war that's being fought with real principles with a real objective what is it Abram going after lot is that right and the Prophet says when you deliver and turn that over and loose from under the protection of the blood then God can go to work you said it can be a day two days week two weeks months however long let me tell you something friends let me listen to me clearly God did not give this to the church so that they would look at it and beat debilitated by what's happened you understand me the greatest thing Paul's letting them know this is committed into the hands of God God has worked through your flesh got his work through all of your encouragement God has worked through your words of admonition now it's completely in the hands of God and there's no better hand than the hands of God that's where Paul is letting them rest that's what gives them strength within it because they know it's resting in the deity of Almighty God it's resting there residing there you love him oh my praise the name of the Lord you pray for me these things right here that God has brought out with I didn't even get very far within that quote but maybe read it you most of you we know this quote by heart but there's things that just was standing out to me so great I couldn't get away from every little bit I had yesterday sneaking around looking at things putting over here looking at things we're here reading over here because these are the holding up of the hands of the pastor what's holding up the hands of the pastor is letting Christ have pre a minute letting the word have its effect your loving brother Bannerman that quote he didn't say hold up my hands but holding up at the hands of the pastor the pastor but the never was bringing that same bill around say he's preaching the same message so what is it it's holding up that hands and as that word is going forth hey that word is going to produce the word is going to produce the word transforms hallelujah in that the truth the word transforms can't you see that's why Satan wants to hinder not working and that's why we always have such a clarity and discerning from Satan your discerning not my brother it's not my sister it's the enemy if we can have that kind of a sharpener sharpening of discernment then it doesn't allow any place within us for there to be a seed to reside you see what I mean because we keep our ground of a certain asset level to where bitterness can't reside oh my I know I've really taken some time there this morning I love you I've truly delivered my soul my heart's delivered I still have more but these things listen friends you know I'm not here to take your time I'm not here to waste time I don't even intend to go these long in these services I have oh I have a timer up here I don't intend to take your time I'm not here to waste time and here to feel time I'm not here to just say things my heart's desire is God I want to say there's a lot of things I could say so a lot of things I can Minister I'd say that by His grace there's a lot of things I can look at but God what is it that we need I tell you what right now these are precious things that God that spoke to us that rod it's not a simple little stick no sure this is the rod of God the deity in the name of Jesus Christ but you love him I love him I love him because he first loved me [Music] [Applause] [Music] honk [Music] Stream love hi love him because he first loved me [Music] jazz mine [Music] [Music] maybe in your heart your life feel like Moses you feel like those hands are a little heavy but remember this God takes us this morning and he would ask Moses this what is this what is that in thine hand examine what's in your hand the Holy Spirit has directed us this morning to examine what's in our hand to look at it if it's just a rod let the deity of God come down say Lord take my life as a surrendered vessel or team take the words that are then caring and holding Lord in my heart the promise Colet the deity of God come down coming to the name of Jesus Christ for need in your life maybe sickness in your body maybe in your spirit maybe in your mind you trouble maybe a test or trial that you're in the midst of right now and it seems so great remember Moses was up against the Reds but he was up against that red sea speak to that water speak that the children before he raised his hand here the judgment rod of golf there was a time and a need where the serpents came among the people when they begin to moan and complain God had him reason down of a brazen serpent on that judgement rod recognizing sin already judge all that the people were commanded to do by faith is to look at to know that right here this morning that if your hands are heavy know that God can give you the strength and grace that you and me need of if you need help you say Lord ah I really want to live an overcoming life let let him let him take hold of all of your doings and let him exalt his word in your life let him move with that great simpleness yet sovereignty and power of his spirit if you look hands are heavy tests to trial under burden but yet yet let God say Lord I cast all my cares upon your Lord before you care for me rest upon that stone let the very presence of God raising giving you strength to rise up maybe you've been living beneath your privileges allowing things to collect in your life allowing things to hold over in your life and hinder you the right now you recognize that what is in your hand that rod in that rod the deity consum life greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world through I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me you don't have to remain weary this morning well I'm not talking about where you will necessarily feel like jumping out of here and running out of here but I'm talking about even where you make a step it may not be a physical step it can be a step right in your mind a step with your heart to say Lord I can't dwell in this cave any longer and you hear the voice of God speaking to you what does thou hear Oh father I wonder this morning how many'd want to be remembered in prayer for any of those things and he needs it's upon your heart whatever you have need of I want you to believe believe that that same God who would come and stir your heart to where you would lift up your hand in defiance to gravity and lift it up before Almighty God where you would go beyond even that of reasoning and you would surrender your will to his will and say Lord Jesus for this need in my life nor that request let the deity come Lord God your presence Lord your spirit move down Lord God for this need let's believe Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we raise our hands Lord I had both of my hands up the Prophet instructing Lord a group of people in one message he spoke to them Lord that they were to lift their hands if they had need of healing in their body asked him Lord if they could lift their hands Lord and he likened that that Lord to Moses when Moses lifted up his hands Lord father we're raising Lord God more than our hands were raising a hearts Lord raising everything or God father Lord at your attention Lord God father Lord Jesus we recognize Lord a greater than Solomon is an arm it's Lord God are greater than all is here Lord it's you Lord God our high priest Lord Father come Lord to

receive that is it [Music] there's like a [Music] [Music] because for us [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] we're being dismissed I want to just just pass a little few things up to you along to you it would be something that would be very fitting even during a prayer meeting to mention but there was a report that where a meteorologist was looking at that hurricane that had come up through there and the meteorologists giving the report I've got her here on one of my on one of my apps but the Jason shared it with me the meteorologist made a statement they said this went from the greatest category of storm to the lowest category of storm this is a meteorologist on air he said there's no way to describe this happening other than the people of God were praying [Applause] it's true there's a lot of it was a lot of destruction a lot of people that there's been lives that were lost and we were saddened by that and there's a lot of things that probably some of you have relatives that were touched maybe you know in greater ways than maybe for others and I I know that you know even they had one that was coming and Jose but Jose is turned up and and it's always interesting these names we were talking about that last week but you know there's another one that that is out there forming but let's remember let's remember each and every one in prayer sometimes we're not feeling the effects maybe of something like that but we've got there's brothers and sisters there's loved ones there's people and listen friends whether they're you know you don't want to see lives lost we don't want to see people if we have the attitude even though we know we know that these things coming out spiraling like it is the earthquake that took place last week in Mexico on the LA Times I was following it where they are troubled they're waiting at any moment for what they term the big winner but what they don't know is is that you're not gonna escape the big one the Prophet told us in thinking man's filter I showed a so there your men on this on on on Friday night waves will splash clear back to Kentucky Phoenix will be a seat board thank God for the way of escape that's been made it's not just about the destruction when we're not interested it's done about discrete remember God God didn't come down the age of talking about destruction and the destruction was impending but he was let him know come that's worship see it was a call to worship amen we're going home because we love him we love his appearing he has appeared to us we love him and that's why we want to be with him our heart longs to be with him though across a span of time and others can look at your life like they did the young man going to school in Rome and say what's different about you I noticed the other people they they say they're Christians but they go out and drink and they want to do this want to do that what's different about you what did that young man say he said you see what it is he said across the sea I promised a young lady that I'll return I'm gonna marry her she said in a certain state in a certain city in a certain house is a little girl that I promised and he said so I don't do those things because I love her and the Prophet said for us standing on this side we abstain from all those things why because we have to because we love him we've heard a sound that's far greater a music that's far greater like the captain you don't have to plug my ears or tie me to the post anymore I've heard something that's greener something that's more precious she loved him let's remember them must remember the saints of God in prayer amen throughout remember of sister Crescent prayer as well she they had to take her in for I think it was on on Tuesday right after brother kress to give a testimony hear her hip had popped out so they had to take her in she was in brother Cresswell had been out doing some shopping and for groceries and then he came home and she was had not fallen thank God we were able to get her by ambulance get her to the hospital the doctor went in and and placed it back in there and I believe they put a brace on a disc that's what your dad told me a brace on him let's remember her in prayer God is still faithful the testimony still holds high Jehovah Nissi the Lord is our banner amen glory be to God so let's remember sister Chris and prayer amen let's just bury it's in a word of Prayer I have any father Lord is we would depart Lord from this place father departing Lord from the presence of one another Lord Lord what a comfort it is Lord to know that we are are never never are we asked or never to depart from your presence father may we Lord God just but just even thinking of the simplicity of the words that you have spoken to us today and what how true in your word when we are weak you are strong or you are our strength as David said speaking of us Lord you're the strength of our life I pray father that you would just guide and direct watch over your children Lord Lord as they travel Lord upon the roadways go throughout the week Lord the children in school different ones Lord the college's Lord and their jobs Lord and father those in need of a job Lord we pray God as you Lord are not only Jehovah Nissi or Jehovah Jireh o God grant and Lord for every every need Lord may you just Lord continue to provide for each of your children father we ask it in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen remember brothers I let the rest of you be dismissed brothers I'd like you to remain if you were just a few moments they that way [Music] with wings as [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we shall now [Music] we [Music] [Music] it's been Smith [Music]
