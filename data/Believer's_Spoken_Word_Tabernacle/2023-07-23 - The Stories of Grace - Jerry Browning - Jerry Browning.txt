seeing just how your spirit Works Lord and we we don't have to as ministers and song leaders and pastors and so forth to to sit down and say let's get this program all together but Lord all we've got to do is yield to you the programs in your hands dear God lord what a confirmation that is to us Lord I pray father that you will bless your people now father with the word may you know in each and every need Lord may you speak to those needs this morning dear God we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and to the glory of God well I understand if you return me in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 1. and what I would title this this morning is stories of Grace stories of Grace Matthew chapter one begin reading at verse 1. the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac beget Jacob and Jacob Judas and his brother and Judas beget Ferris and Zara of Tamar and Ferris baguette SRAM and estrom baguette amram and amram baguette salmon and Samoan beget Boaz of Rahab and Boaz beget Obed of Ruth and Obed beget Jesse and Jesse beget David the king and David the king beget Solomon of her who had been the wife of your eyes now just drop down to verse 16 and Jacob beget Joseph the husband of Mary whom was born Jesus who is called Christ you may be seated now there's many verses we just kind of passed over because it's it we wanted to focus on these particular verses but out of this being the genealogy of Jesus Christ in that genealogy there's only mentioned five women and we know there was more women involved than that everywhere you see somebody begets somebody it was through somebody and uh but uh you know Sarah wasn't mentioned you know and she was the mother of Isaac and uh uh then Rebecca wasn't mentioned and she was the mother of Jacob and these different ones that were would have seemed to have been uh very pure people very pure women they weren't mentioned but there were only five women's names that were mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ and four of those women that were mentioned were Gentiles they weren't even Jews and of these of four of the five that were mentioned were very far less than virtuous they were there was there was something about each of their backgrounds that actually when you consider their stories you can say nothing but the grace of God and when we look at the first one where it says Judas beget Ferris of Tamar uh Tamar was actually the daughter-in-law of Judas and she had been married to judah's uh oldest son who was ER and the Bible says the Earth did evil in the eyes of the Lord and and the Lord took his life he killed him and so then according to how things were to be in the law then Judah was then in turn to give Tamar because ER had there were no uh children and so it was to give her to his next uh son uh the brother of UR who was Onan and he was to braise up seed to his brother and so Judah did this and Onan knowing that it was going to raise up seed to his brother spilled his seed on the ground and that was evil in the eyes of the Lord and so he killed Onan and so here there was one son laughed named Sheila and he was too young to take uh uh Tamar to be his wife and to have children so Judah told Tamar said go back to your father's house and wait till Sheila comes of age and when he comes of age then I'll give you to Sheila and he'll raise up seed to his brother and so Tamar did as she was told went back to her father's house and and while she was abiding there well then Sheila came of age but after Sheila came of age Judah for whatever reason didn't didn't uh keep his promise perhaps Judah thought I've already lost two sons to this woman something must be wrong with her I don't want to lose my only son I got left and so he refused to keep his promise and so then time passed and judah's wife had died and the Bible says and Judah then went to sheer sheep and while he was going to share sheep why uh Tamar was told behold your father-in-law goes to share the sheep in teneth and so she goes and she disguised herself and covers her face and sets by the way and and and actually Judah thinks she's a harlot so Judah goes in unto her and lays with her and then uh he he says while I she's a wife got to pay you and so he says I'll send you a kid from my flock and she says but uh uh you know you've got to give me some kind of a a token or something that you until you send the kid he said well what can I give you and she said well give me your Signet what your Signet was like a ring that would they would Mark and that was as good as their name and she said give me your Signet give me your bracelets and give me your staff and all these things were peculiar to each man and she says give me those things and then when you send the kid off give them back and so he gives them to her and then when he returns home he sends his sermon his servant to uh back down with the the little kid to the from his flock to give to her when he gets there he can't find her anywhere and you know she had went back and took the veil off and put back on her garments of widowhood and they couldn't find this supposed Harlot anywhere and so his servant returns to him and and tells Judah says she can't be found and Judah says why you know that's going to be a bad Mark against me he said uh uh I've got to make sure she gets his skin and I've got to get my my possessions back and so they can't find her and then as time passes you know and and perhaps Tamar becomes uh in her uh pregnancy to where you know there's telltale signs something's going on here and so uh word gets back to Judah and says your daughter-in-laws played the Harlot and she's with child from her Hortons and so Judah says well you bring her here said she's going to die for this and so they bring uh Tamar up to Judah and when she gets there she presents him with his own Signet his own bracelets and his own staff and says the whoever the man is that these belong to that's who I'm with child with and Judah recognized them of course to be his own and he says she was more righteous than I am he said because I refuse to give her to Sheila my son and so uh she puts off her garments of widowhood and the Bible says Judah never knew her again and uh but uh that then she has this child and you realize that it was God she didn't go to have this affair with Judah because of some fleshly desire but there was something inside of of Tamar that was driving her and you know what it was it was God because he couldn't let the lion of Judah fall off and so he had to something had to take place so that the line from Judah because remember friends that was where the Christ was supposed to come from remember he was supposed to be the lion of the tribe of Judah and so it was God that had moved on Tamar to do what she did and also remember Tamar was a Canaanite and the Canaanites were cursed people because of the the the the the the son of Noah that ham who had went in and saw his father's nakedness and come back and told his brothers and his brothers uh turned with the uh cloth and walked backwards into the cave where their father was and covered him up and the Bible says they saw not his nakedness but when Noah came back to himself he realized what his son Hammond did and he cursed not ham but he cursed Ham's son Canaan and he said curse will be Canaan for what you've done and so Tamar came from a cursed people right ma the grace of God why would God allow someone to have been from a cursed people to be part of the lineage of of the Messiah but he did why because he's a God full of Mercy and Tamar being a Canaanite she was a gentile and so when Tamar uh she was pregnant with twins and when the boys went to be born why one of them stuck forth its hand and when it did the the the Midwife that was there took and tied a Scarlet thread around his hand and but then he pulls the hand back and his brother comes out and so the Midwife says this breach be upon you and therefore his name was called Ferris which means the breach and so you realize something here something was going on within the womb of Tamar that Ferris it was supposed to be through Ferris where Judah as offspring would come where that would be in the lineage of Christ and so there's a struggle that happened within her womb who was going to be born first because everything went to the firstborn so we see even the hand of God working there in this birth then the next woman we find that's mentioned in the genealogy of Christ is Rahab now Rahab was a harlot in Jericho brother Branham said there was some Misfortune in life that had then she was a pagan there was some Misfortune in life that had forced her into that way of life but she didn't have to stay there she chose not to stay into what life had seemingly forced upon her and she uh when the Joshua had sent out the spies to come and spy out uh the the city of Jericho where there was two young men that came and when they came then the king of Jericho heard about it and so he wanted despise to be brought before him no doubt to kill them so they couldn't take any word back from of the city back to their leader and so she Rahab the Harlot took the two spies and she hid them on a roof under Flats and when they came to inquire said someone saw these two men come into your house and she said they've left and they've left the city and so when the men that were seeking him left she told the young men she says now you you need to leave she says but look she said I've saved your life and she says and I hope that you will in kindness then look upon me and my family and when you come to take over the city that you'll save us she said because we have heard of Israel and we have heard of all of the Conquering of Israel and we have heard that truly there is a God that is alive in Israel and she said and I want to I want to me and my family to be saved and so she let them down from her window because her her dwelling was actually on the wall of Jericho and she let them down by a car a scarlet cord and they said are your Our Lives for yours you've saved us so said you put this card hang it from your window and when you do when it's Saul anyone sees it then they'll spare you and all that are under this scarlet cord and so Rahab takes and she publicly displays this scarlet cord from her window a public display not something done in secret but it was out to the public I have a token here [Music] and that's the same way with the believer today friends you've come under the blood of Jesus Christ and the blood is your token the blood of Jesus Christ then is on public display Hallelujah then you and your life are on public display and it shall see the scarlet cord showed that something had happened on the inside of that house and you with your token displayed the Holy Spirit it shows that something has happened on the inside of your house all right the Bible says by faith the Harley Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace brother Adam said talking about rehab and why little Bethlehem said when she got the first message from two preachers that went over there quickly she accepted with all her heart and there was a scarlet cord bound to her window for a protection of her house because she had received the message he said she was the type of the Gentile Church she was a gentile and when we heard the message we were all out in spiritual prostitution committing spiritual fornications against the god of Heaven in all kinds of stuff and all kinds of denominations and religions but when we heard that there was a God that still lived that could perform Miracles quickly we received the message [Music] Hallelujah and you know the the walls of Jericho were very thick and Jericho depended on their walls that were built around them to to protect them against any Siege or any uh hostile takeover and so they came and remembered you remember the story I won't take a lot of time on it how they came and according to the words of of the angel for the Lord they marched around the city for seven days and each day they marched around it once and on the seventh day they marched around it seven times and after they had marched around at seven times they let out a a a a holler and a screaming and a rejoicing and the sounds of the trumpets and so forth and when they did the walls came down and I want you to know something friends Rahab lived her house was in the walls of Jericho and when God's power shook the walls of Jericho every part of the Wall came down except the part that Rahab lived in because she had come under the message of the hour and accepted the message of the hour and by accepting it it's saved her [Applause] that wasn't the end of her story there was a captain a prince from the house of Judah that was in Israel and his name was Salman and Solomon you know brother Adam said there started a great romance between Rahab and salmon and then salmon took Rahab to be his wife now think about this friends a prince of Judah taking a woman who had been a harlot to be his wife it shows the grace of God because friends shall moan was a representation of Christ and Rahab being a gentile was a representation of the Bride [Applause] there was nothing clean about us but God took us and cleaned us up Hallelujah and then you know when they begin to just settle the estate uh once they had come into the land and begin to settle the Estates of of Israel why uh salmon was given a land that was very fertile and the lamb was so fertile that It produced wheat uh abundance of wheat and salmon founded a city there in this uh land that was so fertile and called the city Bethlehem and Bethlehem meaning the house of God's bread and then it's so fitting that Christ himself would be born then in Bethlehem what a great romance they had and a great Obedience of faith that Rahab did in Boaz was born then we come to the story of Ruth now Ruth was a mobite and she was the daughter-in-law of Naomi and uh you know Naomi and her husband of course were Israelites but their sons took wives of the moabites now you've got to go way back in time back to the destruction of Sodom to find where the moabites came from and where the mobots came from you remember when the Angels come down to take lot out of Sodom and they took lot and his and his wife and his two daughters remember Lot's wife looked back and she turned to a pillar of salt and so then there was just lot and his two daughters and his two daughters got to talking and said our father's seed line is going to fail right here because remember friends they had been married but were still virgins and and and if you follow the story through the destruction of Sodom and so on you can see why they were still virgins being married because the city was plumbed full of homosexuality right I know that's not a popular thing to say today in this climate in this world but it's the word of God and God still feels the same way about it as he did back then and so these Daughters of block they may they devised a plan each of them would take a turn and go in and lay with their father and would have a child by their father and so the oldest daughter goes in and she has a child a son is born to her by her father and his name was Moe and that's where the mobites came from the mobites came from incest and Ruth was a mobite why would God want somebody of roots caliber to be in his genealogy it's because brother Branham said a person can be born from the two worst parents in the in the city but that has nothing to do with their predestination and soul Bruce lineage coming from the moabites had nothing to do with her selection by God God chose her friends because there was something inside her it was a CG of God good time notice the faith of Ruth she's told by mother-in-law you know their husbands died the two girls the the Ruth and her and her sister-in-law their husbands died and her mother said I'm too old to have any more uh Sons for you and said even if I did and had him today you know you know would you wait around for him until they become of age she said just go back home to your fathers go back to your father's house go back to the denomination of moabites you came from and the the sister-in-law did she turned and went back but Ruth said I'll not go back she said wherever thou goest I will go God people shall be my people and thy God shall be my God [Music] now that's not just wrote in this scripture because it was a beautiful phrase it was wrote in the scripture to show you the faith of this woman she had faith and she knew who was the real God and she said thy God shall be my God foreign so then Naomi says there is a Kinsman a near Kinsman of my husband that might redeem you and so she sends her to go glean in in the field of uh Boaz and Boaz coming along sees this young mobitis woman uh I'll glean you know what gleaning in the fields meant they would send out the young men and they would actually harvest the grain and then whatever got fell on the ground and got left uh there why women would come out into the field and they would pick up what had fallen They Were Gleaming and so and and and they were allowed to glean because of under the law they could glean that and that was to be taken to be theirs so that they can make bread and eat and so Boaz saw her so he instructed the young men let a little bit more of the grain fall touch not this young woman thank you and so Ruth returns and tells her mother-in-law about what had happened about this man Boaz that owned this this this land where she was gleaning and she said he's in near Kinsman to my husband and so she gave Ruth instruction how to go and says and when he lays down at night and you lay down at his feet and take his skirt and pull it over you and she did as she was instructed and when she did then Boaz awoke and realized there was a woman there at his feet he asked her who are you and she tells him I I need you know and so she says I need a Kinsman and she tells about Naomi's property needing to be redeemed that was owned by Naomi's husband and about herself you know and and and that and so Boaz says well there is one Kinsman that's nearer than I but I'll inquire of him and see if he's willing to redeem you if not I'll stand him redeem you ah and so Boaz comes down and makes a public display before the Gate of the city and takes off his shoe and throws his shoe down and declares that he is redeeming all that it had belonged to Naomi and Naomi's husband and thereby friends look he redeemed the land in order to get to this ride Hallelujah and so Christ was our near Kinsmen we had to have someone that was a near kin to us and God was our nearest kin because we came from God but it couldn't stop there to become a near Kinsman to us God had to come down and take upon himself the same flesh that man blood that we walk around in so that he can become us and being near Kinsmen to us and to redeem us and he not only redeemed us he redeemed the whole world he redeemed the Earth he redeemed heaven he redeemed all the names that had been and all the names that would be all the names that were written on the Lamb's Book of Life Ruth was a perfect type of the Gentile bride Hallelujah then we come down to the story of Bathsheba now David being King there was a time that David sent his armies of Israel down to destroy the children of Ammon and they were also to besiege the city of rabba and then he sent them down there and while they were down there David went up and he walked on the roof you know like he always did in the evenings and while he was walking on the roof he looked over down on another roof and he sees a beautiful woman coming out to bathe and David looks on her friends and David lusted after her and so David sins for her to come to the Palace you know and you obey what the king says so she comes and you know I don't know the Bible doesn't tell you exactly what took place you know but uh uh how it came to be but anyway David ended up laying with Bathsheba another man's wife that was adultery and adultery was an adulterer or an adulterous words to be killed they were to be stoned if they were found according to the law and so then he sends her back to her house and then word comes back to him from her I'm with child what's David going to do somehow he's got to cover up his sin he's human well humans are like that we're all like that we always tried to cover up our sin so David tries to cover it up and what he does is he says um boy uh you need to send for Uriah and make him come back from the battle and come back here to to Jerusalem and so Uriah who was a hittite he comes back and when he comes back David says you know go in and see your wife and so but then word comes to David that Uriah refuse to go home but instead he'd laid down in in the door with the servants and so he brings Uriah in and he feeds him and gives him something to drink and says go home and be with your wife and Uriah walks out and lays down to give the search and refuses to go home to be with his wife he said I'll not do it while the men of Israel are out in battle I'll not go into my wife so David says well my plan didn't work so he has to devise another plan to try to cover this up and so quickly now he has to do this quickly you know because it it don't take very many months before a pregnancy begins to show so he's got to do something quickly you know people can get to counting up on their calendar and so he's he sends word out to his captain and says send Uriah up to the front of the battle where they're besieging this city send him up to the front where the arrows are the thickest and so he sends Uriah up there and Uriah of course dies he gets killed in this Siege of the city and David's Captain you know says uh send a servant back uh to him a messenger to tell David that Uriah has died he says now if the King asks you why did we send him up there to the front where the arrows was the thickest you were mine the king that we did it on his order and so he goes back and he tells King David he says uh Uriah is dead so David wipes his brown and says hey you all sin for Bathsheba I'm bringing her up here to be my wife that way nobody can count on the calendar and figure out my sin and so he brings her up there to be his wife and nobody in Israel is the wiser but there's an All-Seeing Eye that's always watching and knows everything we might think we've got our sin here but there's always one that knows all about it and so the prophet Nathan is sent by the Lord up to talk to David and he comes up to David and he says I've got a story to tell you he said there was a traveler that come through and said there was a rich man who had many flocks and much cattle and there was a poor man that only had one lamb and he said the rich man was going to entertain this traveler and so he goes down and takes the one lamb from the poor man and slays that one lamb to feed him and the Bible says David's anger was kindled against this man and he said you bring that man up here surely he's going to die and he's going to pay back what he did Nathan looks at him and says you're the man he said God gave you the kingdom and God give you wives and said and here you went down and you took one man's wife and lay with her he said you have done evil in the eyes of the Lord now friends David didn't say wait a minute now Bathsheba knows I walked there up there on the roof she knew I was going to be up there it's her fault nope David didn't say that David took the blame he said I have sinned he didn't say we have sinned he said I have sinned and he repented and Nathan gets the word from the Lord and he says the Lord hath removed your sin oh Hallelujah and he said surely you will not die he said but the child that was conceived in this act that child will die and so David goes before the Lord and He pleads for the child you know and though he stays and they tried to get him to eat they tried to get him to drink but David won't get up he's prospered himself on his face and he won't get up and then word comes to him says the child has died and so David gets up and he goes and turns and says well now I'll eat and they said while the child was living said you stayed there praying but now that he's gone you get up and you eat like you're rejoicing David says there's nothing I can do for him now and he says I can't bring him back where I am but I can go to where he is Hallelujah why because of the grace of God now I want to tell you a little bit more about David David was the youngest of eight Sons but God chose David remember he brings he he sends Samuel God sends Samuel up there to the house of Jesse and says from the house because remember what happened was Saul was supposed to go and kill the all of the malachites and kill their King agag and Saul doesn't kill the king he brings him back he was supposed to kill all the animals he doesn't he brings back the best and Samuel comes up there and Saul says I have kept all the word of the Lord he said if you have what's that loading of the ox I hear and he says oh well the people you know they saved the best to sacrifice see saw a man he could never take responsibility for his own actions and his own sin it sounds a whole lot like a lot of people out there today they can't people today don't want to take responsibility for their actions it's always somebody else's fault and then because of what he'd done the Lord speaks through Samuel and says this day hap the Lord rent The Kingdom from thy hands and is given to Thy Neighbor and it says the Lord has sought him a man after his own heart to be captained over his people now the Bible in the book of Acts where is speaking it says uh that David that he raised up David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the young the son of Jesse a man after my own heart would shoutful fill all my will in other words he's going to do everything I tell him to do of this man's seed hath the Lord according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus now a man after God's Own Heart friends when God chooses a man and places that man he will not accept another there's there's no one that can take that man's place there is no one that can take your place we were born in thin and shaped in iniquity we may have committed all kinds of sin but but we were always children of God we just had to come to the realization that that's who we belong to we might have been born naturally in this life to some other seed to some other lineage but spiritually where of the lineage of Christ [Applause] admitting our sin and asking for forgiveness is only half the equation the other is to repent and there's and and there's two parts to that asking for forgiveness and then turning from your sin turns me to Psalms 51. I'd like to read this together this is David's repentance after Nathan the prophet it came to him after he had been with Bathsheba and he says this in Psalms 51 have mercy upon me o God according to thy loving kindness according to that multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions watch me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me going down to verse 7. Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear the joy and gladness that the bones which thou Hast broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all of my iniquities created me a clean heart o God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thine Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and behold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from blood guiltiness oh God thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud thy righteousness O Lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shoot forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it thou delightest snot and burn offerings the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise now there are eight wives of David that are named in the Bible and uh I I won't go through all their names but you can find six of them in second Samuel chapter 3 and then of course there's the two Michelle who was his first the daughter of Saul and then there was Bathsheba now of eight wives why would God choose from this woman to be for carrying on the genealogy coming to Christ she was a gentile she obeyed the king and Friends evidently she repented as well the Bible names 19 sons of David there was two others that died in infancy that are not named but 19 of Sons of David are named why didn't God choose one of these others once but remember this child that was to be born from this act of adultery died and then the Bible says David went into Comfort Bathsheba and then she bore a son and he called his name Solomon and the Bible says and the Lord loved him why didn't he pick any of the other sons of David why did he have to pick this one only God knows why did God have to pick me why did God have to pick you because you belonged to him Hallelujah Hallelujah when Nathan the prophet came up to dedicate Solomon he called his name Jedediah which means beloved of Jehovah the ram says Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign one a Sovereign Grace from a sovereign One Sovereign what can it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants to Sovereign Grace can can only be given from the one that's Sovereign and God is sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore be in Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful it don't have it don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do this or can I must I will I it doesn't do it it does itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the viles he can save the worst he can save the imperest he can save the immortalist he can heal the sickest Hallelujah he can save a Wretch like Me and he did what is it Grace William Branham a drunkard son that don't make any difference the grace of God save me you say me a woman's daughter that was no good that don't make no difference the grace of God saved you it's sovereign doesn't have to ask anybody nothing I'm so glad of that can take the violent Sinner and make him white as snow don't have to ask anybody about it it can do it because it's sovereign well I'm so glad that Grace didn't have to come down and ask somebody is it be okay if I saved Jerry Browning you know if it did there would have been some people no doubt they would have said no he ain't no good he ain't no count say well his daddy was a preacher it don't mean nothing he wasn't no good he was one that took advantage of people knowing his dad was a preacher he took advantage of it to gain people's trust and then did what he wanted to do that's the truth the grace saved me brother Branham said talking about these different ones he said no matter what they'd done it didn't matter they were predestinated now we come down to the last woman that's mentioned in the genealogy of Christ and seemingly you wonder then why if we mentioned four Gentiles that were vile people from cursed races and and so on why then would they mention this Israelite woman who seemed to be virtuous why would she then be mentioned other than the fact that she's mentioned as the mother of Jesus well there's more reason that she's mentioned to that it could have just said Joseph beget Jesus but friends Joseph didn't beget Jesus he was conceived of the Holy Ghost and God needed an incubator somewhere to bring this seed forth but not only that friends but Mary had a horrible reputation because she was pregnant about with child and had not been with her husband yet and so it sent out a rumor perhaps she had been with some Soldier perhaps she had been with someone before she came to Joseph or perhaps her and Joseph indeed had this son and had him out of wedlock only Joseph and Mary did the angel come to only Joseph and Mary had been pointed by the angel back to the scriptures that a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child and his name shall be Emmanuel only Joseph and Mary knew this the people didn't know it and so Mary had to Bear a great reproach for Christ remember when Jesus was talking to to the to the priest he says he said they said we have Abraham as our Father and Jesus said if ye were Abraham's children you'd do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the Deeds of your father back then yeah Joseph fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which he conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost we bear the reproach of Christ brother Branham said I'll gladly bear called a whole roller I'll gladly bear the reproach of being called crazy a fanatic I say I'll gladly bear the reproach of saying that I follow a man of saying that I'm in a cult scornful fingers were pointed at Mary same thing today scornful fingers are pointing at you scornful fingers were pointed at Jesus he was despised and rejected of men people hated him why because he did right people hate you because you do right people hate you because God blesses you remember Saul when God had rejected Saul and turned to David Saul was troubled by an evil spirit and Saul said they sent for a Minstrel to come and play for him that it would soothe him during these times and they brought up David who was skilled on the harp and David would play now looks friends Saul was actually angry at God because God had took the Kingdom from him right but he couldn't hurl a javelin at God so what does he do he finds somebody that God's blessing and hurls to Javelin at them David that's the same way those Spirits are today these evil spirits Jesus said blessed are they when which are persecuted for righteous and sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you persecute you and shall see all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets were which were before you the reproach you bear for Christ just proves who you are amen amen that's what Jesus is saying he said because so persecuted they the prophets Jesus says in another place he says rejoicing that day leap for joy what have a Hallelujah breakdown [Applause] start shouting when you're persecuted it shows Who You Are gladly bear his reproach gladly be made fun of gladly be laughed at they ridiculed Jesus they laughed at him they did it publicly they beat him they spit on him uh gladly bear my cross Hallelujah y'all gladly take up my cry my cross and bear it Hallelujah Paul says for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially those that believe in Hebrews it says by faith Moses when he had come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to Rejoice enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward Jesus the Bible says suffered without the gate they took him without the Gate of the city and he suffered and he bore his cross up Calvary up the hill of Golgotha Hallelujah he went beyond the camp brother Brown said raise your hands and say I want to go without the camp no matter what it cost me I'll take my cross and bear it I'll go beyond the camp no matter what people says about me I want to follow him outside the camp I'm ready to go in Access Jesus says it says after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you then ye shall be Witnesses of me in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the Earth a holy ghost baptism was the last until Jesus returns again a little while in the world sees me no more but ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you into the end of the world doing the things that I do you do also through his Spirit working through the church he said you'll be made fun of they called me the Master of the House Bells above the chief of fortune tellers how much more will they call them of his household now blessed are ye when men shall say all manner of things about you rejoice amuse seed and glad because great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you that scripture see there it is so you see you just got to have it friend now you've got to make your choice so Mary it's mentioned because of the great reproach that she bore which is again so fitting of the Gentile Church that bears his reproach let's stand Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this morning Lord for coming down and speaking to us Lord Our Lives are stories of your grace Lord Mercy is a song We were singing before we
