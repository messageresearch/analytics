[36:24] Romans 13
[36:27] we want to start at verse 11 the
[36:30] scripture reads and that knowing the
[36:33] time that now it is high time to awake
[36:35] out of sleep for now is our Salvation
[36:38] nearer than when we believed the night
[36:41] is far spent the day is at hand let us
[36:45] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[36:47] and let us put on the armor of light let
[36:50] us walk honestly as in the day not in
[36:54] ranting and drunkenness not in clamoring
[36:57] and wanness not in strife and envying
[37:01] but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[37:05] make not provision for the flesh to
[37:07] fulfill the lust thereof can we bow our
[37:09] heads for a
[37:10] prayer most gracious kind Heavenly
[37:13] Father we just thank you Lord Jesus for
[37:14] your grace and your mercy Lord we're so
[37:16] thankful For Your Love To Us oh God as
[37:19] the Bible says here in his love not that
[37:21] we loved God but God loved us and gave
[37:25] himself to be the appropriation for our
[37:27] sin sins and Lord to know that kind of
[37:30] love that while we were yet sinners you
[37:33] die for us and that was you commending
[37:36] your love to us oh God I pray we don't
[37:40] doubt that love in our lives anymore but
[37:42] to know that it's of assurity and it's a
[37:45] and it's a steadfast hope that we can
[37:47] hold on into our
[37:49] hearts that it wasn't God didn't love us
[37:52] based on us but he loved us based on him
[37:56] that he wanted to do it and he said he
[37:59] would love us and so that's why we
[38:01] gather together Lord that's why we're
[38:04] all here Lord just to hear from you God
[38:07] we believe you're already working in the
[38:08] midst of this service Lord we believe
[38:10] with all of our hearts Lord and we just
[38:12] ask you Lord whatever you have for us oh
[38:14] God we're just going to lift our hands
[38:16] and accept it from you Lord say God
[38:18] speak to
[38:19] me God use your word and just Minister
[38:22] unto me Lord what I have need of oh God
[38:25] we yield this service and we surrender
[38:27] into your hands now in the name of thy
[38:29] son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the
[38:32] bride set together amen God bless you
[38:34] you may be
[38:36] seated excuse me just pray for me this
[38:40] morning my throat just feels Just a
[38:41] Touch weak
[38:44] um like I said I'm going to preach a
[38:46] message called it's high time to get
[38:50] saved again it's high time to get saved
[38:54] again now that might sound a little
[38:56] strange as I say it may sound kind of
[38:59] confusing but you know brother Bram said
[39:02] one time that sometimes we have to say
[39:03] things in a little bit of a different
[39:04] way to to present it in a different
[39:06] light so it more clinches with us it
[39:09] becomes a little bit more real to us
[39:11] sometimes we have to go outside of the
[39:13] box to see what's in the box and uh you
[39:16] know brother brand would preach a
[39:17] message called a thinky man's filter he
[39:19] got it from a cigarette box right you
[39:21] know you always got to pay attention
[39:23] because God's always uh God's always
[39:26] speaking you remember something the The
[39:27] Whole World's made by God the whole
[39:29] world declares God's glory yeah man made
[39:32] it up man messes it up but listen they
[39:35] can only pervert what God's already
[39:37] created you even look in Hollywood and I
[39:39] don't mean to mention Hollywood or
[39:40] nothing but but you look at anything
[39:42] that's even remotely successful in one
[39:44] sense a lot of times those storylines
[39:46] and things are like are based around
[39:48] self-sacrifice or sacrificing for
[39:50] somebody else or forgiveness and things
[39:53] like that why there's a movie uh again I
[39:55] don't bring up movie there is a chrisan
[39:57] movie from the 70s about the life of
[39:59] Jesus called The Greatest Story Ever
[40:02] Told and why is it called the greatest
[40:05] story because it literally is The
[40:06] Greatest Story Ever Told remember
[40:09] brother B did teach us that the gospel
[40:10] is a drama amen It's a drama of God
[40:14] expressing his attributes towards us and
[40:17] what was one of those attributes how
[40:20] much he loved you see see oh we just I
[40:23] said in my prayer so we're going to go
[40:24] down it amen when the Bible says he
[40:26] commended his love love towards us okay
[40:29] in that while we were yet sinners Christ
[40:31] died for us okay what is God trying to
[40:34] express to us he is not necessarily
[40:37] trying to express that he does love you
[40:40] though he does he's trying to show you
[40:43] just how much he loves
[40:46] you amen why because it says in Romans 5
[40:49] he said for a good man somebody might
[40:51] die for a good man and even for a
[40:53] righteous man some would even dare to
[40:54] die but God is going to show you how
[40:58] much he loved you in that why are you
[41:02] were yet a sinner Glory why you weren't
[41:05] even looking for it even him knowing all
[41:08] the mistakes and failures you were going
[41:11] to make he still died for your
[41:15] sins you can't write it any better than
[41:19] that
[41:21] amen you see this is a drama amen God is
[41:24] trying to express these things to us and
[41:27] so sometimes we have to say things in a
[41:30] little bit of a different way for us to
[41:32] approach something that we all do deal
[41:34] with and that's what I want to kind of
[41:37] do so like I said this title may seem
[41:40] strange because you might sit there and
[41:41] go brother Stephen you're saying it's
[41:43] high time to get saved again do you mean
[41:46] I need to get saved again I mean what
[41:48] are you trying to say and I think that's
[41:50] a fair question so what I'm first going
[41:53] to talk to you about is what I'm not
[41:56] talking about
[41:59] what I first want to express to you is
[42:00] when I say it's high time to get us
[42:02] saved again I want to First tell you
[42:04] what I'm not talking about if you do
[42:07] have that first quote in 61 in questions
[42:10] and answers brother Braham says
[42:11] something pretty interesting
[42:13] here he said he said well he said I want
[42:16] to say something this is somebody
[42:17] talking to brother brandom he said you
[42:20] I've heard you say that if a man was
[42:22] once saved that he could never be
[42:25] lost okay and what did Brother Ram say
[42:27] to that he said I said that's exactly
[42:31] what the scripture said and listen I
[42:34] know this can be hard for us to graas
[42:36] sometimes because we do look at this
[42:38] through human eyes you have to
[42:40] understand something if God ever saves
[42:43] somebody they can't lose that you hear
[42:46] me that's right now listen you need to
[42:48] throw your flesh out the door you need
[42:51] to throw your opinions out the door okay
[42:54] if God ever saved anybody that that
[42:57] means they can never lose that can I can
[42:59] I say it like this for a second do you
[43:01] think God Wast his time no I don't think
[43:04] God Wast his time amen so if God came
[43:07] down and saved somebody guess what
[43:10] they're
[43:12] saved and they can't lose
[43:14] that and your Prophet said that's
[43:17] exactly what the scripture
[43:19] says he has eternal life and shall never
[43:22] come into condemnation or judgment but
[43:24] has already passed from Death on life I
[43:26] said that's what that wasn't me said
[43:28] that that's what Jesus Christ said now
[43:32] isn't that something yeah see and I'm
[43:34] going to tell you something it's so hard
[43:36] for us to grasp our minds around this
[43:38] sometimes it can be hard for us to
[43:41] understand this fully because we'll look
[43:42] at it and go but look how they're acting
[43:45] look what they're doing okay but I want
[43:47] to present it like this just real quick
[43:49] just so you can understand it a little
[43:50] bit it is not so much that when somebody
[43:54] is acting wrong that ever they were
[43:56] saved or not
[43:57] the issue was or that they that they are
[44:01] God saved and lost their salvation the
[44:03] issue is were they ever saved to begin
[44:05] with that's good you see so what is
[44:08] fruits what is manifestation it's
[44:10] evidence of salvation but you do
[44:13] remember something about this real quick
[44:14] and now we're going a little bit
[44:15] different okay you remember repentance
[44:18] is a work of the Holy
[44:19] Ghost you hear me repentance is a work
[44:22] of the Holy Ghost so just because
[44:25] somebody has failed God and got caught
[44:27] up in a sin or something like that or
[44:29] did something terrible does not mean
[44:31] that they're out of the will of God
[44:33] still now if they don't repent and
[44:35] justifying themselves ah something's
[44:38] wrong but listen if somebody does mess
[44:41] up and they come and say I'm wrong I
[44:43] Repent how many times should you forgive
[44:46] them how many times should you forgive
[44:48] them how many times he going to do that
[44:50] I know you know where I'm going cuz
[44:51] Jesus was asked the same question wasn't
[44:53] he that's right how many times should I
[44:55] forgive my brother till seven times said
[44:58] nope till 70 time 7 amen I guess there's
[45:02] not a limit then you see we have to stop
[45:05] looking at Mercy and this salvation
[45:07] through our
[45:09] eyes because we're not doing the saving
[45:11] preach at brother
[45:13] Stephen that was so good we're not doing
[45:15] the saving it's not my salvation that
[45:17] makes you let you get in it's his
[45:22] amen so if God Saves somebody who are we
[45:26] to say he can't
[45:28] that was so good amen who are we to
[45:31] decide who gets a make it or
[45:34] not we're here to build God's
[45:37] kingdom not our
[45:43] kingdom oh well I feel it we're not here
[45:46] to preach we're not here to build a
[45:47] message Kingdom either right all right
[45:50] come on did you know brother bam didn't
[45:52] actually build a kingdom himself right
[45:54] the kingdom was already here did you see
[45:56] it it was already here
[45:58] amen it's Jesus Christ Kingdom you
[46:01] remember Jesus Christ never left the
[46:03] church he may have let the church World
[46:06] they may have put him out but God never
[46:08] let the left those who believed in
[46:10] him in the Book of Revelations the Bible
[46:13] says the son of man walked in the midst
[46:15] of the golden candlesticks what is the
[46:17] golden candlesticks brother B taught us
[46:19] what it types it's the seven Church ages
[46:22] he never left the church
[46:25] ages he never left the the
[46:28] church the church left
[46:31] him to the point of he's outside the
[46:33] door knocking isn't
[46:35] he but do you know he's still
[46:38] knocking think about they put him out
[46:40] what did Jesus do glory to God you ought
[46:42] to thank God for the mercy and Grace of
[46:44] almighty
[46:46] God I feel like if we had the
[46:48] opportunity to do it we would have put
[46:49] him out
[46:51] too you know brother bam said we would
[46:53] acted the same way like Eve but this eve
[46:55] and the last day is pre predestinated
[46:57] not to fall that's good that's good amen
[47:01] not that we couldn't fall we're
[47:03] predestinated not to do it is because of
[47:06] God's grace and mercy Hallelujah and
[47:09] when Jesus Christ was put out of the
[47:10] church ages what did he do he didn't
[47:12] keep walking did he Glory he turned
[47:15] around and started knocking he still
[47:18] wanted us to come
[47:19] in oh you see what I'm saying it's uh
[47:22] the the the the mercy of God is far past
[47:25] trying to figure it out
[47:27] right so then why do we spend time doing
[47:31] it listen now I'm going to talk about
[47:33] you for a second why do you spend so
[47:36] much time trying to figure out the
[47:37] salvation of God in your
[47:40] life am I really saved or not am I
[47:43] really going to make it or not why do
[47:44] you spend so much time doing that when
[47:47] the Bible says whom the son of man has
[47:49] set free is free
[47:51] indeed so what he said you know what
[47:53] blood brother said in the church age
[47:54] book he said do you know how you know
[47:56] know God loves
[47:57] you he said because he said
[48:01] so that's what he said because he said
[48:03] so cuz he said he
[48:06] did so why isn't that
[48:09] enough you see what I'm saying amen we
[48:13] always question these things we always
[48:15] get nervous about it am I going to make
[48:16] it or not if God ever saved you once you
[48:18] are still saved tonight right or today
[48:21] you're still you were saved last night
[48:23] and you're still saved now still thank
[48:26] you
[48:28] amen so I'm talking about what I'm not
[48:30] talking about that's good when I say
[48:33] high time to get saved again we're not
[48:35] talking about getting more salvation
[48:38] somehow when God saved he's better at it
[48:41] than us when God does something it
[48:44] happens amen do you know how powerful
[48:47] this salvation
[48:48] is let's put in a little bit of context
[48:51] amen we're going to we're going to talk
[48:53] about a little bit about Saul and
[48:54] David's relationship
[48:56] okay because you look at Saul Saul was
[48:59] called of God to be king of
[49:01] Israel okay but listen Saul did some
[49:05] pretty bad
[49:07] things he did some pretty rough
[49:10] things first off he disobeyed God and
[49:12] try to justify why he disobeyed God yeah
[49:15] saying you know remember Samuel came the
[49:17] prophet came and said I hear the
[49:18] bleeding of sheep he said oh the people
[49:20] made me do it see excuses right blamed
[49:23] everything else by
[49:25] him he he was the king you know what I
[49:27] mean he wasn't some beggar he was the
[49:29] King right he was the king of the nation
[49:31] he could have told the nation we're not
[49:32] going to do it right but he said oh the
[49:35] people maybe do it this maybe do it oh
[49:37] we could use the money all these things
[49:40] right so he was openly disobeying God
[49:43] true amen not only did he you know how
[49:46] much he disobeyed God do you know how
[49:49] much he did you find out later uh Samuel
[49:52] will call him the enemy of
[49:54] God Amen he couldn't even hear from God
[49:57] anymore the spirit of God was departed
[49:59] from
[50:00] him I wonder what the church World
[50:02] thought of him would have Saul would
[50:04] have walked in the back doors here
[50:07] today the Bible says that the spirit of
[50:09] God departed from
[50:12] him and it was so departed from him he
[50:16] had to get a help from a witch yeah
[50:18] that's good a witch of Endor that's how
[50:21] far down he went that's good that's good
[50:25] amen remember and remember that witch
[50:27] got nervous cuz she remember he
[50:29] disguised himself so she didn't know it
[50:31] was the king at the time and said well
[50:33] hey you're going to get me in trouble
[50:34] here don't you know the king said there
[50:36] should be no Wizards and witches right
[50:38] and that's the very guy who made the
[50:41] rule to make her scared was calling for
[50:43] a witch to help her so look at this he's
[50:46] disobeying God he's such a
[50:48] hypocrite I needan such a one I mean a
[50:51] big
[50:52] one this isn't just like lie on your IRS
[50:55] form listen
[50:58] okay you know what I mean who knows you
[51:01] know whenever you do your taxes you
[51:02] don't even know if you did them right
[51:03] you don't know what's going to happen
[51:05] right IRS calls you and says hey you owe
[51:07] $110,000 what are you going to say about
[51:09] it you know what I mean so but this is
[51:12] more of this is way bigger than just a
[51:15] little hypocrite
[51:17] amen and we know what's going to happen
[51:19] to Saul later Saul's going to turn into
[51:20] a
[51:21] murderer remember he may not succeed but
[51:23] he did try to kill David not once not
[51:27] twice three times he tried to kill this
[51:30] guy because of
[51:33] Envy did you know Saul even tried to
[51:36] kill his own son yeah isn't that
[51:39] something I mean this is terrible and
[51:41] the spirit of God left him amen he
[51:44] couldn't even hear from God anymore
[51:47] getting a witch to come and bring up
[51:50] Samuel now remember this Samuel was
[51:53] somewhere cuz Samuel does come up
[51:56] remember that amen there is life after
[51:59] this amen just cuz you die don't mean
[52:01] it's the end of it remember B taught us
[52:03] that amen death is just changing where
[52:06] you're your real changing where you're
[52:08] at amen doesn't change who you are you
[52:11] remember that right if you're saved now
[52:13] you'll be saved then if you ain't saved
[52:15] now you won't be saved then he doesn't
[52:17] get better after death only for those
[52:19] who accepted him
[52:21] amen so Samuel was somewhere and that
[52:25] witch brought it up amen and guess what
[52:27] brother Ram taught us Samuel was still a
[52:30] prophet he was still a
[52:33] prophet and what did he say listen what
[52:36] would the church have said about this
[52:38] man
[52:39] Saul what would the church
[52:42] said oh they've been a little nervous to
[52:45] church I'm preaching now I hope you're
[52:47] with
[52:48] me listen I've Been Around Church people
[52:51] quite a bit you can't hide from
[52:53] me I know how this stuff works that's
[52:56] true one little thing happened and boom
[52:58] get them out the door they shouldn't be
[53:01] sitting in here don't you know what they
[53:03] did don't you know what they did sure
[53:06] they probably did sure they probably
[53:09] deserve it too remember you will reap
[53:11] what you sow we're not talking about
[53:13] that amen I've said it like this before
[53:16] amen you can be saved but you eat moldy
[53:18] bread you might get sick from it didn't
[53:21] make you any less saved that day you
[53:23] just shouldn't have ate the moldy bread
[53:25] it's the same thing amen you do bad
[53:27] things you reap bad things
[53:30] yeah okay when you do bad things you'll
[53:33] reap them amen Saul reaped Saul did
[53:37] everything wrong ends up dying a
[53:39] horrible
[53:40] death loses in battle and so forth loses
[53:45] his family loses it all but when Samuel
[53:48] came up Amen brother bam taught us this
[53:51] this is the scripture brother bam uses
[53:54] to teach the lesson of once saved always
[53:57] saved that's good this is the story he
[53:59] uses when Samuel came up he said you and
[54:02] your sons are going to be with
[54:06] me just one little sentence there I even
[54:10] had I reread it up in my office just to
[54:12] make sure I had it fresh in my mind I
[54:15] had to read the passage three times cuz
[54:16] I missed it just one little line yes you
[54:20] will be with me that's so wherever
[54:24] Samuel's at that's where where Saul
[54:28] is amen don't you see once you get saved
[54:32] when God Saves you you're not even
[54:35] strong enough to get you out of
[54:37] it amen think about it how saved was
[54:43] Saul how saved was
[54:45] he he was he was so saved as a murderer
[54:49] a liar disobedient to
[54:52] God and he still made it
[54:56] that's right think about it how I hope
[54:59] you understand what brother Stephen's
[55:00] trying to say what am I not talking
[55:03] about okay when I say get saved
[55:06] again I'm not talking about you need
[55:08] more
[55:09] salvation okay when God Saves somebody
[55:13] he saves him for
[55:14] good when God saved listen you listen
[55:18] you are not a
[55:22] mistake you are not a failure in God
[55:27] remember salvation is of the Lord he's
[55:30] the author and finisher of our faith
[55:33] don't you don't you say he started it
[55:35] you didn't even start faith God
[55:38] did the Bible says you're even saved by
[55:40] faith and that Faith was a gift of
[55:42] God so God gave you the faith to believe
[55:46] and then now he say he started he said
[55:48] he's going to finish it and you're going
[55:50] to sit there keep trying to pull your
[55:51] hair out all the
[55:54] time oh it's so hard to be a Christian
[55:57] oh I'm not saying it's not listen when
[55:59] you start thinking with this with your
[56:01] flesh of course it's difficult that's
[56:04] right when you take your Works your body
[56:06] of works and everything you've
[56:09] done uh you know I've always wanted this
[56:11] you remember when brother BR went beyond
[56:12] the current time and he was you know
[56:15] well how over old he was probably 4550 I
[56:17] can't remember exactly but you think
[56:19] about it you know he s in the bed you
[56:20] know he's fraying about he said Lord I
[56:22] haven't done enough for you right if I
[56:26] he said if I'm going to do anything for
[56:27] you Lord I better start now and you
[56:29] think to yourself what do you mean yeah
[56:33] look at all you've done look what this
[56:36] man done and look what his effects of
[56:38] his ministry do
[56:41] today it still affects us is it that's
[56:45] why this message is so amazing can you
[56:46] say Amen those quotes were spoken 60
[56:49] years ago and somehow when God takes a
[56:53] quote and you can feel the anointing hit
[56:56] amen amen and you go what it still works
[57:01] today still
[57:04] somehow that's why you know why it's
[57:07] because that was God's message it wasn't
[57:08] brother bams it was God's
[57:11] message it was the word may flesh for
[57:14] our day
[57:15] amen glory to God and
[57:19] Hallelujah but you do know even brother
[57:21] Bram dealt with this
[57:22] idea
[57:24] amen and he was and they're going I
[57:27] haven't done enough for God yet look at
[57:29] that he was looking at everything he's
[57:30] done at things like that and he realized
[57:33] H still not good
[57:34] enough you know I wonder if we do that
[57:37] sometimes too when you think with this
[57:40] of course you're going to fail oh yeah
[57:43] of course it seems impossible but I'm
[57:46] going to tell you something you need to
[57:47] quit this and just look at
[57:50] this just look at this this has the
[57:54] power to change you
[57:57] it sure does this has the power to do it
[58:00] I I've told people that all the time oh
[58:02] you know it's been so hard to serve the
[58:04] Lord I asked him did you read your Bible
[58:05] today there you go well no well yeah I
[58:08] guess it is there you go is that so
[58:11] surprising brother BR was asked right
[58:13] how do you get closer to God read your
[58:15] Bible and pray every day what do we
[58:17] always seem to
[58:20] forget listen just so you know I'm
[58:22] throwing myself in with you I have
[58:24] failed God in this too
[58:26] amen I've seen how different my days was
[58:28] when I opened this versus not I've seen
[58:31] how my days were different amen and then
[58:35] you sit there and go oh man it was so
[58:36] hard it was so hard to be a Christian
[58:39] today oh boy and you didn't even didn't
[58:42] even go to the source of
[58:43] Christianity you're not even supposed to
[58:45] do it by yourself why you keep doing it
[58:47] by yourself then that's good PR you know
[58:50] they even you know you you see those
[58:51] things at Walmart they have the pictures
[58:53] now right if something too big hey you
[58:55] need somebody to help pick it
[58:57] up amen right you got to get you know
[58:59] double team whatever those pictures are
[59:01] you ever see them and you're supposed to
[59:03] get two people for heavy lifting and
[59:05] you're sitting there trying to pick it
[59:07] up by
[59:08] yourself and God is just a phone call
[59:13] away
[59:15] amen call them up call them up tell them
[59:19] what you want Jesus is on the main line
[59:24] now you know where that song comes from
[59:26] right it's the idea of when they had to
[59:27] used to do the old phones right it's not
[59:29] it's hard to relate now because we don't
[59:31] do the operator anymore but back in the
[59:34] day you had an operator and they're the
[59:35] ones that connect phones well if
[59:37] somebody was already calling that person
[59:39] they couldn't push you in it was already
[59:41] in there right and the song is telling
[59:44] you that there's nobody in the way
[59:47] there's nothing in the way for you to
[59:48] call Jesus that's Jesus is on the
[59:50] mainline there's nobody in the way you
[59:52] can get right there as soon as you want
[59:53] to call him bam he's there
[59:57] he's ready to
[59:59] listen he's ready to hear what you
[1:00:01] need amen he's on the main line there's
[1:00:04] nothing in the way for you to talk to
[1:00:06] God
[1:00:07] Amen nothing in the way for you to do it
[1:00:10] amen you love the
[1:00:14] lordo God is good can you say Amen
[1:00:18] am so I hope we understand I got some
[1:00:20] scriptures to say this but we're going
[1:00:21] to just keep going because I feel good
[1:00:24] amen so I hope you understand what
[1:00:26] brother Stephen is saying what I'm not
[1:00:29] saying now when I say it's high time to
[1:00:31] get saved again I'm not asking you to
[1:00:33] find more salvation right not asking you
[1:00:37] to uh you need another salvation because
[1:00:39] when you messed up you lost the first
[1:00:41] one God didn't waste his time on you you
[1:00:44] are not a mistake to God God don't mess
[1:00:48] up you know what I mean God don't mess
[1:00:50] up amen he can take your messy life and
[1:00:53] make it the will of God isn't that so
[1:00:55] amazing amen I think I shared this with
[1:00:57] you last time about Jonah you remember
[1:00:59] the story about Jonah amen Jonah messed
[1:01:02] up everything yeah he was supposed to go
[1:01:04] to tarus he went or neeva and he went to
[1:01:06] Tarsus he walked the opposite
[1:01:09] direction amen but God took his mistake
[1:01:13] and made it the will of
[1:01:14] God isn't that something God took away
[1:01:17] he didn't do what God told him to
[1:01:20] do and yet Jesus will take that story
[1:01:25] and say as Jonah was in the whale's
[1:01:27] belly for three days and three nights
[1:01:29] shows how the son of man be in the heart
[1:01:31] of the earth did you know Jonah's the
[1:01:33] only type of the
[1:01:35] Resurrection do you know Jonah was
[1:01:37] representing that so you remember what a
[1:01:39] type is type is more than just
[1:01:40] connecting scripture it's a prophecy
[1:01:43] types and shadows in the Old Testament
[1:01:44] were Prophecies of the New Testament so
[1:01:47] Jonah was expressing a prophecy of what
[1:01:50] was going to happen to Jesus later and
[1:01:52] it was such a prophecy Jesus quotes it
[1:01:54] as one
[1:01:56] as a reflection of his own Ministry now
[1:01:59] think about this for a second how did
[1:02:01] Jonah end up in that whale's belly
[1:02:03] that's right by doing what God told him
[1:02:06] not to do did you know why Jonah was in
[1:02:10] that whale did you know why he didn't go
[1:02:11] Anya first he tells you later in Jonah 4
[1:02:14] why he did it he said because he
[1:02:17] understood God was a merciful god yeah
[1:02:20] and he knew if he went there and and
[1:02:22] presented the word he knew they get
[1:02:24] saved and he didn't want them
[1:02:28] saved that's pretty hard to
[1:02:31] hear amen it almost sounds like Jonah's
[1:02:34] the villain of the story a little
[1:02:37] bit he did not want to save them but God
[1:02:41] wanted them save so much he said too bad
[1:02:46] Jonah not even Jonah a prophet could
[1:02:49] stop God trying to express mercy and
[1:02:51] salvation to somebody that's what God
[1:02:55] does to people who try to stop salvation
[1:02:59] throws them in a whale's
[1:03:01] belly you need to go down there and
[1:03:03] think for a
[1:03:05] second you need to go down there and
[1:03:07] think for a
[1:03:09] second and what did go and God took that
[1:03:11] attitude of that Prophet yeah God took
[1:03:14] that mistake that mess up I mean he he
[1:03:17] was not acting according to how God
[1:03:18] wanted to do it that's right amen his
[1:03:22] attitude his personal opinion if you
[1:03:23] will what he thought was no I don't want
[1:03:25] them saved right and God said you're
[1:03:29] going there because I want them
[1:03:31] saved it was completely
[1:03:35] opposite and yet God took that attitude
[1:03:37] in that story and transformed it into a
[1:03:40] type of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:03:43] amazing that's amazing God is so amazing
[1:03:48] ain't
[1:03:51] he don't ever downplay the grace and
[1:03:54] mercy of almighty God that's
[1:03:57] right God is good at it God can take
[1:04:01] mess ups and I'm talking about major
[1:04:03] mess ups I'm talking about bad things he
[1:04:05] can take horrible things and transform
[1:04:08] them into the will of God that you'll
[1:04:10] look back and you won't even be able to
[1:04:12] find the mistakes anymore of just how
[1:04:15] great God was amen God
[1:04:19] Amen so that's I hope you understand
[1:04:22] what I'm saying it's the time to get
[1:04:24] saved again I'm not talking talking
[1:04:25] about what God did in your life I'm not
[1:04:29] talking about that I'm not talking about
[1:04:31] salvation so then you would say well
[1:04:33] then brother Stephen if that's not what
[1:04:35] you're talking about then what in the
[1:04:38] world are you talking
[1:04:40] about and I think that's a fair
[1:04:43] question I think that's
[1:04:45] good remember as I said we looked at
[1:04:47] Saul and we looked at everything Saul
[1:04:49] did and the mistakes he
[1:04:51] made and we know that David become Kings
[1:04:54] after you know so amazing about the
[1:04:56] Bible it's even amazing the Bible
[1:04:58] records these stories of these mistakes
[1:05:01] these mans have just so you know people
[1:05:03] always want to question whether the
[1:05:04] Bible's true or not this is one of the
[1:05:06] vindications of the Bible just so you
[1:05:08] know is that it's not just a historical
[1:05:10] account of
[1:05:11] Israelites you know how we know that
[1:05:14] because Israel wrote about all the bad
[1:05:16] things they did then there's no nation
[1:05:19] that when they get their own history
[1:05:20] books write about all the bad stuff
[1:05:22] that's right you know when I was in
[1:05:23] public school amen and we learned about
[1:05:25] American history we didn't read about
[1:05:27] all the Native Americans we killed come
[1:05:30] on now you know brother B said there's
[1:05:32] blood on the flag you know brother said
[1:05:34] that right absolutely because of what we
[1:05:36] did to the
[1:05:36] Indians but did you know I never learned
[1:05:39] that in American
[1:05:40] classroom I didn't learn that in an
[1:05:42] American history book you had to you had
[1:05:45] to kind of dig a little bit and you find
[1:05:46] out oh boy we weren't the best people
[1:05:48] were
[1:05:49] we amen all I read about was Pocahontas
[1:05:53] and John Smith you know what I mean
[1:05:54] right oh yeah they love for us to come
[1:05:56] and take over their lands and put
[1:05:58] buildings all over the place they really
[1:05:59] wanted us to do that yeah right you know
[1:06:02] what I
[1:06:03] mean you see what I'm saying a country
[1:06:05] doesn't write about their own mistakes
[1:06:07] and their own history
[1:06:08] books amen and yet you look at the Bible
[1:06:12] they're writing about all these things
[1:06:14] why it's not a histor it's not just a
[1:06:16] history book of the Israelite people
[1:06:19] it's God's word being spoken to
[1:06:22] us and God is showing us a comparison
[1:06:25] here between Saul and David here yeah
[1:06:27] showing you something about salvation
[1:06:29] showing you something about what's going
[1:06:31] on just how powerful salvation can be
[1:06:34] yeah but like I said this is what I'm
[1:06:36] trying I'm getting to what I'm talking
[1:06:37] about amen is that when you looked at
[1:06:40] Saul despite what Saul could do he could
[1:06:44] never lose his
[1:06:45] salvation amen now he did lose the
[1:06:48] benefits of
[1:06:49] it sure amen he lost the presence of God
[1:06:52] didn't he and remember this David saw
[1:06:56] that David saw what happened to Saul and
[1:07:00] Saul and David still respected Saul
[1:07:02] isn't that so amazing what a great
[1:07:04] attitude David had you know what I mean
[1:07:06] towards somebody listen might be a
[1:07:08] lesson for oh now oh that felt good
[1:07:11] that's a lesson for us can you say Amen
[1:07:13] you go that look how David treated
[1:07:18] Saul that even though this man tried to
[1:07:20] kill him three times he wouldn't touch
[1:07:21] the Lord's
[1:07:22] anointed wouldn't even touch him matter
[1:07:26] of fact when that man came and said he
[1:07:28] cut off the head of Saul well that guy
[1:07:31] thought he was going to get a pretty
[1:07:32] good penny from David hey you know David
[1:07:34] I took out your enemy right when the
[1:07:37] world looked at David and Saul they
[1:07:39] thought they were enemies true but
[1:07:41] that's not how David felt about it Oh
[1:07:43] Glory to God isn't that so
[1:07:46] wonderful but I you want to become an
[1:07:49] invincible Army it's not about just how
[1:07:51] big and tough we are in faith and things
[1:07:53] like that Saul and David were an
[1:07:55] invincible
[1:07:57] Army so much that Satan couldn't even
[1:08:01] separate him Hallelujah David never
[1:08:03] looked at Saul any different David was a
[1:08:06] part of an invincible
[1:08:08] Army I'm going to take that home and
[1:08:10] study it
[1:08:12] later that's good that is so profound to
[1:08:15] me because that man have thought they
[1:08:17] were enemies so much that he cut Saul's
[1:08:21] head off and said hey David look what I
[1:08:22] did for you he said how could you raise
[1:08:24] up the hand against the Lord's anointed
[1:08:27] and he had that man slew that man who
[1:08:30] slew Saul thought he was doing David a
[1:08:32] service found out he was actually
[1:08:34] cursing David David never looked at all
[1:08:37] like that
[1:08:39] once help me Lord can you say Amen am
[1:08:44] towards one another towards each other
[1:08:47] towards them out there how do you look
[1:08:50] at them how do you act towards
[1:08:52] them hallelujah boy I I've been
[1:08:55] preaching a lot about this lately so you
[1:08:57] forgive me about this amen don't ever
[1:09:00] condemn the world for the things they do
[1:09:02] that's all they got that's right of
[1:09:04] course that's all they got you go oh
[1:09:05] you're surprised they're a sinner it's
[1:09:07] like it's like somebody jumps in a pool
[1:09:08] and you're trying to wonder why they're
[1:09:10] wet well of course they're wet they fell
[1:09:13] in the
[1:09:14] pool that's right oh look at all these
[1:09:17] Sinners out there of course they're
[1:09:18] Sinners that's all they
[1:09:21] got the only they they'll make it is for
[1:09:24] salvation what you have
[1:09:26] and don't forget that I say we be like
[1:09:28] David amen let's be like David in this
[1:09:30] regard anyways because there's some
[1:09:32] other regards we're going to find out
[1:09:34] here in a little
[1:09:35] bit
[1:09:37] amen because David ends up getting
[1:09:39] caught up and he starts doing some bad
[1:09:41] things that even Saul
[1:09:44] did and did you know David was actually
[1:09:46] half more successful than
[1:09:48] Saul remember Saul tried to kill David
[1:09:51] right he tried to but he
[1:09:53] failed right but then and all of a
[1:09:55] sudden David one time caught a gliss of
[1:09:57] a
[1:09:58] woman amen and he wanted that woman
[1:10:00] you'll find out later when Nathan
[1:10:02] approaches David later about it Nathan
[1:10:05] said if you would have asked I would
[1:10:06] have gave it to you that's what Nathan
[1:10:08] says he Nathan tells him if you would
[1:10:11] have just sought the Lord and got it you
[1:10:13] could have had anything you wanted yeah
[1:10:16] and that's why brother Ram said if he
[1:10:17] would have asked for basba he would have
[1:10:19] gave it to
[1:10:20] her wow but he decided to go a different
[1:10:23] route didn't he and just took her that
[1:10:26] night and all of a sudden guess what
[1:10:29] she's with child David Goes
[1:10:33] uh-oh remember he's King though remember
[1:10:36] that yeah this ain't just some joeo

[1:10:43] Israel amen remember we're all human you
[1:10:45] remember that we're all human that's
[1:10:49] from the pulpit to the
[1:10:51] back now you got to reap what you s

[1:10:55] get about mercy and
[1:10:56] Grace David was the
[1:10:59] king and he also sudden impregnates this
[1:11:02] lady and so what he just tried to do oh

[1:11:06] would just came out and
[1:11:08] apologized wouldn't it just been
[1:11:10] different no he didn't do that did he

[1:11:42] secretly God's going to punish you
[1:11:45] openly so we know that's why David is
[1:11:47] doing this he's trying to hide it
[1:11:49] secretly and what does he do what does
[1:11:51] he do he's going to send a riah to
[1:11:53] battle oh no wait I'm sorry I skipped a

[1:13:41] as bad way anything salt did yeah same
[1:13:44] boat same
[1:13:46] issue and all of a sudden one day I hope
[1:13:49] you can put yourself in the story a
[1:13:50] little bit there's a reason why God put
[1:13:52] this in the
[1:13:53] Bible there's a reason why right nowed
[1:13:56] cuz I have no doubt we've all been a
[1:13:58] David like
[1:13:59] this no doubt whatsoever that we've all
[1:14:02] had David
[1:14:03] moments amen but listen if you're a Son
[1:14:06] of God it won't say
[1:14:07] hidden it won't St hidden if you're a
[1:14:10] child of God he's going to fix you and
[1:14:13] sure enough Nathan shows up amen Nathan
[1:14:16] the prophet shows up says you know what
[1:14:19] I kind of want to read it now amen it's
[1:14:22] first it's uh it's either 1 or 2 Samuel
[1:14:24] 12
[1:14:26] wow you know why uh I was actually just
[1:14:28] rereading it and then somehow I
[1:14:30] memorized the location
[1:14:33] so I want you to read this with me if
[1:14:35] you don't
[1:14:38] mind 2 Samuel 12 verse
[1:14:42] one 2 Samuel 12 and verse one the
[1:14:47] scripture reads and the Lord sent Nathan
[1:14:49] unto David and he came unto him and said
[1:14:52] unto him there were two men in one city
[1:14:54] the one rich and the the other poor the
[1:14:56] rich men had exceedingly many flocks and
[1:14:58] herds but the poor men had nothing save
[1:15:01] one little amb which he had brought and
[1:15:04] nourished up and he grew up together
[1:15:06] with him and with his children and did
[1:15:07] eat of his own meat and drink of his own
[1:15:10] cup and lay in his bosom and was unto
[1:15:12] him as a daughter boy God laying on
[1:15:14] thick yeah he is sure is isn't he laying
[1:15:18] on thick look how much important this
[1:15:22] was to this man yeah
[1:15:25] verse four and there came a traveler
[1:15:27] unto the rich
[1:15:29] man and he spared to take of his own and
[1:15:32] he spared to take of his own flock and
[1:15:34] of his own herd to oh I'm sorry and
[1:15:36] there came a traveler unto the rich man
[1:15:38] I wonder who this traveler
[1:15:40] was who is this traveler cuz watch what
[1:15:43] this rich man's going to do for this
[1:15:44] traveler and he spared to take of his
[1:15:47] own flock and of his own herd to dressed
[1:15:49] for the wayfaring man that was come unto
[1:15:51] him but he took the poor man's lamb and
[1:15:54] dressed it for the the man that was come
[1:15:55] to him wonder who that traveler was I
[1:15:58] wonder if that mind battle comes in your
[1:16:00] mind sometimes it wasn't him was it it
[1:16:04] wasn't the rich man it was the traveler
[1:16:06] that came by and he wanted to take care
[1:16:08] of the traveler not so much take care of
[1:16:12] himself so who actually want who
[1:16:15] actually wanted that
[1:16:16] lamb the wayfaring traveler The Traveler
[1:16:20] he's dressing it for the traveler you
[1:16:22] see what happens to us sometimes you'll
[1:16:24] get a a traveler in your mind a waying
[1:16:27] person in your mind a thought in your
[1:16:28] mind and what happened you started
[1:16:30] entertaining
[1:16:31] it you started giving a life with your
[1:16:33] thoughts and your actions and what
[1:16:36] happened all of a sudden you're killing
[1:16:39] your best
[1:16:40] friend see it wasn't actually David
[1:16:43] though you see you see that in that
[1:16:46] scripture there I hope you can see that
[1:16:48] there came a traveler unto the rich man
[1:16:51] it's not the rich man just wanted
[1:16:52] another sheep a traveler showed up and
[1:16:56] wanted that lamb but then the traveler
[1:16:58] the the man didn't
[1:17:01] want he when the rich man went to give a
[1:17:04] lamb he took the lamb from the other
[1:17:06] person entertaining that wa that
[1:17:10] traveler that's what happens to us we
[1:17:12] entertain things contrary to the word
[1:17:15] that's how you get caught up in this
[1:17:16] stuff that's how David got caught up in
[1:17:19] it amen and so then he asked him and
[1:17:23] dressed a man and then vers five watch
[1:17:25] and David's
[1:17:27] anger was greatly kindled against the
[1:17:29] man and he said to Nathan as the Lord
[1:17:32] liveth the man that had done this thing
[1:17:34] shall surely die now who's the one that
[1:17:36] actually took the lamb though was it the
[1:17:39] traveler it was the rich
[1:17:42] man and so David was upset boy David was
[1:17:46] mad I think you should be mad did you
[1:17:49] see though he thought he'd done this
[1:17:51] secretly so who could know what he
[1:17:53] actually did look when David judged the
[1:17:56] situation that Nathan just presented he
[1:17:59] condemned
[1:18:00] himself he knew what was going on was
[1:18:03] wrong David knew the rich man knew this
[1:18:05] was wrong amen anybody looking at the
[1:18:08] story knew that the rich man is the bad
[1:18:11] guy in the
[1:18:12] story you can tell yeah the traveler may
[1:18:15] have tricked him maybe or something amen
[1:18:18] he might have get caught up in something
[1:18:19] but who did
[1:18:21] it so no wonder David was upset David
[1:18:24] was mad presented this story and go
[1:18:26] there's no way that man should die to
[1:18:29] death verse six and he shall restore the
[1:18:32] lamb 44 because he did this thing and
[1:18:35] because he had no
[1:18:38] pity wow boy yeah yeah he laid it on
[1:18:41] thick didn't he oh he's righteous look
[1:18:43] how great I am d already forgot what he
[1:18:48] did verse 7even and Nathan said to David
[1:18:52] Thou Art the man
[1:18:55] Thou Art the man thus sayith the Lord
[1:18:57] God is I know the king and deliver thee
[1:18:59] out of the hand of Saul so forth we're
[1:19:01] just going to stop there Thou Art the
[1:19:04] man so see not only what David did was
[1:19:07] so
[1:19:08] horrible amen it was so terrible what he
[1:19:12] did not only was it that terrible when
[1:19:15] David judged the
[1:19:17] situation he judged himself wrong to Die
[1:19:20] the death he should restore he should be
[1:19:23] taken cuz he had no pity
[1:19:25] that came out of David's
[1:19:28] mouth so not only does David know this
[1:19:32] he knows what was wrong he know he did
[1:19:34] it secretly he know he was
[1:19:37] wrong and like I said he wasn't much
[1:19:40] better than Saul at this
[1:19:42] point
[1:19:44] amen but I'm going to show you his
[1:19:46] reaction to it if you don't mind turn to
[1:19:48] Psalms
[1:19:50] 51 that's good Psalms 51 that's a good
[1:19:56] Psalms 51 I want you to read this with
[1:19:58] me again I'm trying to present this in
[1:20:01] such a way I'm trying to tell you what
[1:20:02] do I mean when I say it's high time to
[1:20:04] get saved
[1:20:07] again what does it mean what do I talk
[1:20:10] about because look David's got a lot of
[1:20:13] problems right now don't he and remember
[1:20:15] he's going to reap a lot from this he's
[1:20:18] going to reap aot he's going to lose
[1:20:19] that
[1:20:20] child he's going to lose that child even
[1:20:23] when he tried to fasten save the child's
[1:20:25] life still wasn't
[1:20:28] enough so he's going to reap what he got
[1:20:30] from this but I want to show you how he
[1:20:32] reacted to something he did like this
[1:20:35] it's in Psalms 51 and just so you know
[1:20:37] in case you ever wondered I don't know
[1:20:40] if you ever read the little things in
[1:20:41] the beginning part before verse one but
[1:20:44] it says to the chief musician a Psalm of
[1:20:46] David when Nathan the prophet came unto
[1:20:47] him after you are gone in to basba so
[1:20:51] this Psalm is a direct re reaction to
[1:20:54] what what Nathan told
[1:20:55] him amen and when he was finally faced
[1:20:58] with his
[1:21:00] sin amen and remember he actually was
[1:21:03] going to say I I should die the death
[1:21:05] and I'm
[1:21:06] done what did God say I departed your
[1:21:09] iniquity from
[1:21:12] me amen oh isn't that amazing how saved
[1:21:16] are
[1:21:18] we that we get so nervous you know what
[1:21:20] I mean and why am I preaching this
[1:21:22] you're going to see in a little bit amen
[1:21:24] we use these sometimes in the excuse to
[1:21:26] stay in
[1:21:27] depression to St nervous and anxiety
[1:21:30] that's good and situations will happen
[1:21:32] all a sudden you're shaking getting
[1:21:33] nervous I think it's time for you to get
[1:21:35] saved again amen get back to what saved
[1:21:39] you that's good amen it wasn't these
[1:21:41] situations these bad times that got you
[1:21:43] saved Jesus Christ was the one that
[1:21:45] saved you you go yes sir cuz this is
[1:21:48] what happens to David here and remember
[1:21:50] he saw what happened to Saul he saw that
[1:21:53] when Saul left a of God an evil spirit
[1:21:56] came on him and all of a sudden David
[1:21:59] finds himself in the same situation he
[1:22:02] finds himself a murderer an adulterer a
[1:22:06] thief he was coveting his neighbor's
[1:22:09] things he was against the word of God
[1:22:11] he's finding himself in the same
[1:22:13] situation and so he's going is the Lord
[1:22:15] going to depart from
[1:22:17] me is an evil spirit going to come upon
[1:22:20] me then that's good and watch what he
[1:22:23] says verse one
[1:22:25] have mercy upon me oh God according to
[1:22:27] thy loving kindness according to the
[1:22:28] multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out
[1:22:31] my
[1:22:33] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[1:22:35] my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[1:22:37] did you know he is saying it's his sin
[1:22:40] oh that's a big deal right there there
[1:22:42] you go yes it it wasn't anybody else's
[1:22:44] fault it wasn't the Traveler's fault it
[1:22:47] wasn't the soldiers fault he threw away
[1:22:50] the excuses yeah that's good blot out my
[1:22:54] iniquity there you go my transgressions
[1:22:58] sir amen verse three for I acknowledge
[1:23:01] my transgressions and my sin is ever
[1:23:04] before
[1:23:06] me listen this is difference between
[1:23:08] Saul and David
[1:23:10] here what is David trying to do he's
[1:23:12] trying to get saved
[1:23:15] again he's trying to get saved again but
[1:23:17] it's not getting more salvation he's
[1:23:20] trying to get back to what he already
[1:23:22] had the traveler came and threw him off
[1:23:25] maybe and what does he has to do he has
[1:23:28] to get back to where God saved him then
[1:23:31] there you go I hope I'm preaching amen
[1:23:33] it see you never lost your salvation you
[1:23:36] never lost it but sometimes Satan will
[1:23:39] come and try to throw you off course try
[1:23:43] to throw you try to focus on people
[1:23:45] focus on situations focus on
[1:23:48] disheartening and and and just shakeups
[1:23:50] and so forth you got to get back to what
[1:23:53] saved you
[1:23:55] that's you got to say to yourself it's
[1:23:57] high time to get saved again there you
[1:24:02] go I'm going to skip
[1:24:04] down to verse
[1:24:06] 10 Psalms 51:10 create in me a clean
[1:24:10] heart we know this song Don't We and
[1:24:14] renew a right Spirit within me watch
[1:24:17] what he says in verse
[1:24:18] 11 cast me not away from thy presence
[1:24:23] and take not thy hope Holy Spirit from
[1:24:25] me why is he praying this cuz he knew
[1:24:28] what happened to
[1:24:29] Saul he knew what happened and he found
[1:24:33] himself in the same
[1:24:35] situation I wonder if that happens to us
[1:24:38] sometimes oh you're acting good around
[1:24:40] Saul during the beginning of your life
[1:24:42] listen I'm going to preach that just for
[1:24:43] a second okay I'm going to bring it real
[1:24:44] real okay when you get first Saved it's
[1:24:47] the greatest time in your life yes I
[1:24:49] know it was for me when I was first
[1:24:51] Saved I was a house on fire in a windy
[1:24:53] day yeah amen I there was nobody I
[1:24:56] wouldn't witness to I'd bring it up
[1:24:59] right even if they didn't ask I'd bring
[1:25:01] it
[1:25:02] up I got everybody mad at me though I
[1:25:05] found out real quick people don't like
[1:25:07] serpent seed people just don't like
[1:25:09] it now see when I first found out Ser
[1:25:12] seed I loved it I was said this is the
[1:25:13] greatest thing I ever heard and I was so
[1:25:16] on fire I told
[1:25:19] everybody but what happens when you
[1:25:21] start living a little bit yeah there you
[1:25:23] go
[1:25:25] what happens when we start living a
[1:25:26] little bit and start walking some of
[1:25:27] these trials yeah what happens shoulders
[1:25:30] start slumping a little
[1:25:32] bit what happens your knees start
[1:25:34] getting feeble a little
[1:25:37] bit and and in one sense I'm not
[1:25:39] necessarily blaming you for it it's life
[1:25:42] life can be tough sometime we got to go
[1:25:45] through trials and things like that and
[1:25:46] disc discouragements to build us up God
[1:25:48] knows what he's doing amen he knows what
[1:25:50] he's doing with David here it's not like
[1:25:52] David surprised him with this
[1:25:55] but remember maybe God sent David
[1:25:57] through this to teach us a
[1:25:59] lesson of his attitude towards what he
[1:26:02] did compared to Saul and that's what's
[1:26:04] going to dri and and David is looking at
[1:26:06] this and going yeah I'm messed up but I
[1:26:09] know there's one thing I can't miss and
[1:26:11] that's the spirit of God God don't
[1:26:14] depart from
[1:26:16] me take not thy Holy Spirit from me that
[1:26:20] was the difference between Saul and
[1:26:21] David when David finally met his sin and
[1:26:24] condemned himself he ran to the sight of
[1:26:27] God and went back to when he was saved
[1:26:30] amen hallelujah that's so good yes sir
[1:26:35] verse 12 restore unto me the joy of my
[1:26:41] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[1:26:46] spirit David still admitted he was
[1:26:51] saved he still admitted he had salvation
[1:26:54] but what did he lose the joy of it the
[1:26:59] feeling of it the thing about salvation
[1:27:02] that stir you up a little bit sometimes
[1:27:04] I know you ain't saved by feelings amen
[1:27:07] but don't throw the baby out with the
[1:27:08] bath
[1:27:10] water I like feeling good in God don't
[1:27:12] you I don't want to come to church and
[1:27:14] be all sad and depressed every time I
[1:27:16] show up I want to feel God I don't want
[1:27:20] to lose the joy of my salvation when God
[1:27:23] saved me I want to still shout about
[1:27:26] it the Bible says in Job 38 when the
[1:27:29] morning Stars sitting together and the
[1:27:31] sons of God shouted for Joy what was the
[1:27:34] Joy about the joy of thy
[1:27:38] salvation Hallelujah that's a good
[1:27:41] connection that was pretty good wasn't
[1:27:42] it praise the Lord Jesus amen when they
[1:27:45] were shouting for Joy what were they so
[1:27:47] happy about it wasn't all the nice cars
[1:27:49] they were going to have or the big
[1:27:51] houses but that God was going to them
[1:27:59] amen Lord they were shouting for Joy
[1:28:02] amen they were happy for that
[1:28:05] salvation what did David lose he didn't
[1:28:08] lose his salvation he lost the joy of
[1:28:12] it and he recognized that and he ran to
[1:28:17] the side of God to get it
[1:28:20] back can I say something to you if
[1:28:23] you're getting a little too depressed
[1:28:25] you forget what it means to be happy as
[1:28:27] a Christian yeah you need to get fall
[1:28:30] flat on your
[1:28:31] face and get right with God get back to
[1:28:35] God none of this stuff none of what
[1:28:38] you're going through is worth Lo worth
[1:28:41] losing the joy of the Lord that's right
[1:28:44] right there is nothing hear me are you
[1:28:46] hearing me there is nothing worth losing
[1:28:51] the joy of the Lord hallelujah yes sir
[1:28:54] there's nothing worth it
[1:28:58] right your bitterness has never been
[1:29:00] worth it that's
[1:29:04] good
[1:29:05] well I thought we were supposed to be
[1:29:07] all happy and
[1:29:10] everything here I am though
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:15] man you being right is not worth losing
[1:29:18] your joy uhhuh true that's good you hear
[1:29:21] me yeah you cuz you know I know how that
[1:29:24] bitterness Spirit works the first step
[1:29:27] to bitterness is justifying it yeah you
[1:29:30] got to justify it Satan knows if it
[1:29:32] doesn't make any sense why be bitter
[1:29:34] about it but when he can start making it
[1:29:36] make sense oh they did hurt you didn't
[1:29:39] they
[1:29:40] yeah oh look what they did to me see
[1:29:44] what is the first step to bitterness oh
[1:29:45] this is all free I hope you understand
[1:29:47] God's talking amen what's the first step
[1:29:50] to any bitterness he's got to justify
[1:29:52] it convince you of it makes sense don't
[1:29:56] it that's what he did to Eve makes sense
[1:29:58] reasoned with it makes sense don't it
[1:30:01] you ought to feel bad about this kind of
[1:30:03] makes sense don't it you being right is
[1:30:06] it worth losing your joy of your
[1:30:09] salvation bitterness has never been
[1:30:12] worth
[1:30:14] it why what is bitterness it's an
[1:30:17] unforgiving Spirit there you go that's
[1:30:20] what bitterness is it's an unforgiving
[1:30:23] spirit yes sir and if you can't forgive
[1:30:27] did you know you can't
[1:30:28] believe that's right I'll give you some
[1:30:31] homework it's in perfect Faith go right
[1:30:33] after the scripture reading brother Bon
[1:30:35] makes one sentence that a part of me
[1:30:37] wishes he would have preached the whole
[1:30:38] message on but he makes one sentence he
[1:30:41] said faith is based on forgiveness yes
[1:30:46] he did faith is based on forgiveness so
[1:30:51] if you can't forgive
[1:30:54] you can't
[1:30:58] believe and do you see why David's
[1:31:01] praying this restoring to me the joy of
[1:31:03] my
[1:31:05] salvation I don't need why because
[1:31:07] because if he doesn't have the joy
[1:31:09] something's replacing that Joy then it
[1:31:12] could be shame condemnation remember
[1:31:14] you're not supposed to be under a
[1:31:15] condemnation spirit either God forgave
[1:31:17] the sins of the whole world you ain't
[1:31:18] that bad your mistakes weren't that bad
[1:31:22] God's grace is still stronger than you
[1:31:25] your sins ain't stronger than God's
[1:31:27] grace amen so you don't SP so you see
[1:31:31] what I'm saying if there's no joy then
[1:31:34] it's being replaced by another
[1:31:36] spirit amen it's re being replaced by
[1:31:39] condemnation it could be replaced by
[1:31:42] bitterness and none of that stuff is
[1:31:44] worth what it's supposed to be
[1:31:46] there the joy of the
[1:31:50] Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength
[1:31:55] thank you Lord I just remembered it
[1:31:57] amen so if you got no joy that's why
[1:32:01] your knees are feble it's why you
[1:32:03] getting scared about everything that
[1:32:05] nervousness spirit is coming in yes it
[1:32:08] is why do we get depressed you know what
[1:32:10] I mean I want you to think about it from
[1:32:12] the outside perspective okay just for a
[1:32:15] second okay you know if somebody promise
[1:32:18] you're going to live forever and
[1:32:19] everything going to be hunky dory and
[1:32:20] you get sick he's going to heal you he's
[1:32:22] going to take care of you and everything
[1:32:23] like that
[1:32:25] amen you'd be like well then if he
[1:32:27] covered all my bases what's there to be
[1:32:28] nervous
[1:32:30] about you know what I mean and so then
[1:32:33] if you do start to become nervous though
[1:32:35] don't you feel that be a little weird
[1:32:37] from look at it from the outside for a
[1:32:38] second wait a minute that guy owns
[1:32:41] everything and he just told you he's
[1:32:42] going to take care of
[1:32:44] everything so then somebody would look
[1:32:46] at you go why are you getting so nervous
[1:32:48] true and think about it why don't you
[1:32:50] look at yourself for a second why do you
[1:32:52] get so nervous that's good right why do
[1:32:55] you get so
[1:32:57] scared it can't be because God has
[1:32:59] failed you because God don't fail
[1:33:03] anybody has God ever failed you I can
[1:33:05] tell you something God's never failed me
[1:33:07] that's right oh I have failed God oh
[1:33:11] yeah plenty of times yes sir but God has
[1:33:15] never failed me
[1:33:17] once and so I want to make sure you
[1:33:21] understand what I mean when I say it's
[1:33:22] high time to get saved again
[1:33:25] I am not talking about whether you're
[1:33:26] saved or not but look what David lost
[1:33:30] when he forgot about his salvation when
[1:33:33] he got on the Wayward side if you will
[1:33:35] and did what he did amen what did he
[1:33:38] have to get back to not salvation no but
[1:33:41] he had to get back to the Joy the
[1:33:42] feeling of being
[1:33:44] saved I have so many quotes on this but
[1:33:47] I if you guys don't mind let me just
[1:33:49] read one quote for you and we'll call it
[1:33:52] amen watch what brother said it's in
[1:33:54] letting off the
[1:33:55] pressure in uh 62 watch what brother
[1:33:58] Bram says
[1:33:59] here 62 it's towards the bottom of the
[1:34:02] sermon just so you know it's the second
[1:34:04] to last quote brother said letting off
[1:34:06] the pressure I want you to read this
[1:34:07] with me he said now we you must continue
[1:34:11] with the faith that you have when you
[1:34:13] feel the presence of the Lord is with
[1:34:16] you you know what I mean listen like I
[1:34:19] said you're not saved by feelings I get
[1:34:21] it there's going to be times when you
[1:34:22] don't feel nothing you're going have to
[1:34:23] stand on the word that's going to happen
[1:34:26] Okay but surely when you feel him you
[1:34:29] ought to be standing
[1:34:31] too you know what I mean it's okay hear
[1:34:35] me church it's okay to feel
[1:34:38] [Applause]
[1:34:40] godall it's okay to be happy to be a
[1:34:45] Christian
[1:34:47] amen I really like how he says that I'm
[1:34:50] G to say it again I think now you must
[1:34:53] continue with the faith that you have
[1:34:55] when you feel the presence of the Lord
[1:34:57] is with you now many people wonder what
[1:35:00] happens they seem like they're healed
[1:35:02] and then after a while they don't feel
[1:35:04] that way but it's because that when
[1:35:06] prayer is made and the presence of is
[1:35:09] with you Faith mounts up and then when
[1:35:12] Faith leaves well then something
[1:35:14] happened to you you must remain with
[1:35:18] that Faith right what is he describing
[1:35:20] when the faith mounted up okay it's not
[1:35:23] like you got more faith but Faith was
[1:35:25] put up to a place where you're like all
[1:35:27] things are
[1:35:29] possible right you're going all things
[1:35:31] are possible and you're in the presence
[1:35:32] of God then when you start to leave it
[1:35:34] what happens oh Faith kind of like I
[1:35:36] said you didn't it's not lowering the
[1:35:38] amount of faith faith moved it's not
[1:35:41] mounted up there anymore and you're
[1:35:43] going oh wait a minute since it's not
[1:35:44] mounted up anymore uh something wrong no
[1:35:47] brother man said something happened he
[1:35:49] said and what does he say to do he says
[1:35:52] You must remain with that Faith don't
[1:35:55] never let that feeling leave
[1:35:59] you don't never let that feeling leave
[1:36:03] you what was David doing he wasn't
[1:36:07] trying to get more salvation he was
[1:36:09] trying to get back to the joy of his
[1:36:12] salvation the feeling of it you know
[1:36:16] what I mean when you feel saved I'm not
[1:36:18] just talking about when you have to say
[1:36:20] you're saved amen and that can work
[1:36:22] don't get me wrong
[1:36:24] you're supposed to do that you're not
[1:36:26] saved because of feeling but listen it's
[1:36:28] okay to have a god with skin on
[1:36:30] sometimes too you know what I mean as as
[1:36:33] that you know that boy said one time
[1:36:35] with that Mama coming up in the
[1:36:38] attic and and that mama said well son
[1:36:40] don't you know we believe in God don't
[1:36:41] worry about the thunder we're Christians
[1:36:42] we believe in God he said yeah but it's
[1:36:44] nice to have god with skin on sometimes
[1:36:46] that's why yeah you believe in healing
[1:36:48] don't you but sometimes it's okay to
[1:36:50] come up for prayer cuz sometimes you
[1:36:52] need a god with skin on see both are
[1:36:55] just as true it's okay amen and listen
[1:36:59] sometimes you're going to have to stand
[1:37:00] there I'm saved do you feel like it nope
[1:37:03] but I know it's the
[1:37:04] word but you can't do that
[1:37:07] forever and sometimes you're going to
[1:37:09] need God on your side and sometimes
[1:37:12] you're going to be by yourself and your
[1:37:14] faith mounted up when you were first
[1:37:15] Saved right and you're going to be
[1:37:17] sitting there going man Lord this has
[1:37:19] been rough I'm I'm going to testify to
[1:37:22] you right now there's a reason why I'm
[1:37:23] preaching this this morning may not be
[1:37:25] for you but it's for
[1:37:27] me cuz we go through rough things don't
[1:37:29] we we go through tough situations and
[1:37:32] you're sitting there trying to figure it
[1:37:33] out and you keep focusing on the
[1:37:35] situation so much you kind of forget
[1:37:37] that God's in it all the
[1:37:39] time and you kind of forget sometimes
[1:37:42] wait a minute we're still we still win
[1:37:44] you know what I mean I'm still saved
[1:37:46] even if I mess up this situation a 100
[1:37:48] more times I'm still going to make it
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:54] and sometimes when you're in the
[1:37:55] trenches you kind of forget about this
[1:37:58] sometimes and that's why I'm saying it
[1:38:00] might be high time for you to get saved
[1:38:03] again get back to what it meant when you
[1:38:06] were first Saved brother B said that one
[1:38:08] time oh the times when I was first Saved
[1:38:11] that's you know what I mean and I know I
[1:38:14] can testify like that I kind of wish I
[1:38:16] can go back to that guy amen I think
[1:38:19] I've testified this to you before I you
[1:38:21] know I I one of my gifts is I got to
[1:38:23] huge memory I just remember a lot and so
[1:38:26] when I read the Bible I can almost tell
[1:38:28] you what it's going to say before it
[1:38:29] even says it and it's just what God gave
[1:38:32] me right but what can happen to me
[1:38:34] sometimes is I'm easily bored then it
[1:38:36] could be hard for me to read this and I
[1:38:38] know that sounds tough for a preacher to
[1:38:39] say but I'm just being honest with you
[1:38:43] if there's a fault I have it's being too
[1:38:44] honest sometimes to be honest with
[1:38:47] you but the reason why I say that is
[1:38:49] that one time I prayed I got down on my
[1:38:52] knees and said God
[1:38:53] I wish I could forget the
[1:38:55] Bible I've said God I wish I could
[1:38:57] forget everything so I can go back and
[1:38:59] read it
[1:39:00] again so I could go back and read it
[1:39:03] again yeah and listen sometimes you need
[1:39:05] to go back to when you were first Saved
[1:39:08] go back to that moment get back in that
[1:39:11] feeling you know what I mean when you
[1:39:13] were first reading it when you were
[1:39:15] first seeing it amen get back to that
[1:39:18] point amen yeah we go through tough
[1:39:21] times don't we Church
[1:39:24] amen we go through the ringer sometimes
[1:39:26] and sometimes it's the only thing you
[1:39:27] can think
[1:39:29] about and it's so clogs your mind you
[1:39:32] ever been there sleepless nights you
[1:39:35] keep thinking about it over and over and
[1:39:36] over again amen if you're not thinking
[1:39:40] about it you're just sitting there like
[1:39:41] a
[1:39:42] vegetable you know just trying to figure
[1:39:44] it all
[1:39:45] out amen we've been I know I've been
[1:39:49] there y so I'm trying to tell you what
[1:39:52] you should do in this
[1:39:54] situations when you find yourself there
[1:39:57] why don't you just get saved again go
[1:40:00] back to that certain scripture that
[1:40:02] spoke to you you know I got one you know
[1:40:05] what it is it's job 38:7 it's what I
[1:40:07] just quoted to you earlier it's the
[1:40:09] first scripture I ever read in my life
[1:40:11] that I read it and I finally saw myself
[1:40:13] in the Bible when the sons of God
[1:40:15] shouted for joy that was the first time
[1:40:18] I looked and said that's
[1:40:19] me that's me see go back to the those
[1:40:23] scriptures that spoke to you go back to
[1:40:25] that message you what message I go back
[1:40:27] to oh listen you're going to have to
[1:40:29] forgive me church I'm betting a little
[1:40:31] bit now
[1:40:32] okay I just feel so at Homer sometimes I
[1:40:35] get in trouble because of that you know
[1:40:36] what I mean letting off the pressure 62
[1:40:39] in June oh no it's not letting on PR
[1:40:42] it's super sign super sign and I go back
[1:40:45] to that quote sometimes you just have to
[1:40:46] listen to it again because it takes me
[1:40:48] back to an experience I had when I was
[1:40:50] first saved that was one of the first
[1:40:51] sermons I heard and brand was actually
[1:40:54] remember when he raised that baby in
[1:40:55] Mexico um and so the next day the the
[1:40:58] papers interviewed him and he's talking
[1:41:00] about that and a Catholic Catholic
[1:41:02] journalist interviewed him says you
[1:41:04] believe our Saints could raise the dead
[1:41:05] too brother B said well that' be hard
[1:41:08] because they're dead right how can a
[1:41:11] saint raise the dead when you can't be a
[1:41:12] saint until you're dead right right so
[1:41:15] he said what's your opinion of the
[1:41:17] Catholic Church brother REM said I'm
[1:41:19] sorry you asked me that
[1:41:24] and he said and he said uh do I got to
[1:41:26] answer it he said i' like to hear you
[1:41:28] brother said it's the highest form of
[1:41:29] spiritualism there is there you go and
[1:41:32] he said what do you mean he said well
[1:41:34] all these gods and goddesses that you
[1:41:36] pray to he said they're dead yeah Mary
[1:41:39] and all these people they're dead so
[1:41:40] you're just praying to dead people yeah
[1:41:42] and the reporter said well Mr brandham
[1:41:45] Christ Jesus Christ died and you worship
[1:41:48] Him He said but he raised again on the
[1:41:50] third day and he's alive now he said
[1:41:53] [Applause]
[1:41:55] amen now I tell you that story to tell
[1:41:59] you what happened to me when I first
[1:42:01] heard that CU I was driving to work DMP
[1:42:04] going on 66 North in a green Focus yeah
[1:42:08] I still remember
[1:42:09] everything and when I heard that come up
[1:42:12] on my thing I just had a jubilee in my
[1:42:14] car I was in both lanes ditches having
[1:42:17] the time of my
[1:42:21] life I I'm saying that because God is
[1:42:24] taking me back there for my sake right
[1:42:27] now and I'm so thankful for what the
[1:42:29] Lord did for me and I have no doubt you
[1:42:32] got testimonies in your life that
[1:42:35] sometimes you're going to need to go
[1:42:36] back to go back to when you were first
[1:42:39] Saved what it felt like get back to that
[1:42:42] feeling
[1:42:45] again cuz I'm want to tell you something
[1:42:47] church and I'm going to close with this
[1:42:48] I'm going to invite the musicians up oh
[1:42:50] you forgive me church I went way long
[1:42:52] didn't I you forgive for
[1:42:54] that let me tell you something though
[1:42:58] this is just brother Steven a little bit
[1:43:00] life don't get
[1:43:02] easier no sir the more you go through
[1:43:06] life the more you're got to find out
[1:43:07] it's just going to get harder and hard
[1:43:09] and can I say something as
[1:43:11] Christians it's kind of expected to
[1:43:13] happen remember brother Ram said you did
[1:43:15] not got you did not get saved to be on a
[1:43:18] picnic right you got saved to be a
[1:43:21] soldier amen
[1:43:24] so I'm going to tell you something life
[1:43:25] don't get
[1:43:27] easier so but instead of trying to
[1:43:30] figure out how to make it easier for
[1:43:32] yourself you need to spend more
[1:43:35] time trying to say okay Lord how do I
[1:43:37] deal with it yeah that's
[1:43:40] good that's real good you start praying
[1:43:43] God I'm not praying for the burdens to
[1:43:46] disappear but I'm praying for the
[1:43:48] shoulders to Bear them yes amen yes sir
[1:43:52] I'm not praying for everything to just
[1:43:53] disappear but Lord I'm praying for the
[1:43:55] strength to hold up
[1:43:58] still Lord the Bible says when a
[1:44:00] righteous man falls he falls seven times
[1:44:03] but Lord I need the strength to get up
[1:44:06] again yes sir cuz you supposed to keep
[1:44:09] getting up like I said life ain't going
[1:44:11] to get any
[1:44:13] easier remember Isaiah remember Isaiah
[1:44:16] in the Bible he's he he he had a brother
[1:44:19] one time he thought was going to be
[1:44:20] great Hezekiah he thought he was a great
[1:44:22] king and this King did do some great
[1:44:25] things the Bible says that Hezekiah did
[1:44:27] that which was right in the sight of the
[1:44:30] Lord but that one time he walked into
[1:44:32] the temple try to take the priest's
[1:44:33] office leprosy was found out on his
[1:44:35] forehead and he died a leopard brother
[1:44:38] bam tells us in letting off the pressure
[1:44:40] or I'm sorry identification that he said
[1:44:42] that uh Isaiah looked up to Hezekiah and
[1:44:46] all a sudden he got confused yeah said
[1:44:48] wait a minute how could this great king
[1:44:50] do something like this
[1:44:53] how could this great man do something
[1:44:55] like this see Isaiah was looking too
[1:44:57] much at the
[1:44:59] man depending on men depending on man to
[1:45:03] fulfill
[1:45:05] everything and when that man
[1:45:08] failed seemed like all of Isaiah's World
[1:45:12] failed that brother Ram said he was
[1:45:13] trying to figure it out all of a sudden
[1:45:15] one day he's praying and guess who

[1:45:20] up the train filled the Temple what's
[1:45:23] that train is that smoke the incense

[1:45:32] there seeing the Lord high and lifted up
[1:45:36] and the angels had their faces covered

[1:45:45] nowhere to be
[1:45:46] found it was the Lord high and lifted up
[1:45:50] oh yeah and when Isaiah saw this as he
[1:45:54] was struggling about some other man
[1:45:56] guess what happened to him all of a
[1:45:58] sudden Isaiah forgot about Isaiah oh I'm
[1:46:01] sorry Isaiah forgot about
[1:46:03] Hezekiah all of a sudden Isaiah forgot
[1:46:06] about him and guess what he was in need
[1:46:08] of prayer all of a
[1:46:10] sudden what' he say as soon as he saw
[1:46:12] that what did he say Lord I'm a man of
[1:46:15] unclean lips glory and I dwell in the
[1:46:19] house of unclean lips what did he found
[1:46:22] out none of us can do it Hallelujah none
[1:46:26] of us all of us have been failures all
[1:46:28] of us fail when he looked at Hezekiah
[1:46:31] when the Lord showed up he forgot about
[1:46:33] him he said Lord I'm I'm that man
[1:46:36] now I'm the one that needs God's help I
[1:46:40] stand in the knee of
[1:46:44] prayer and aren't you glad the vision
[1:46:46] didn't
[1:46:47] stop amen cuz what happened one of the
[1:46:50] Angels took a live coal from the altar
[1:46:53] Glory took a live Co and touched his lip
[1:46:55] and what did he say he said thou are
[1:46:59] clean glory to God you're not going to
[1:47:02] be clean by a man's testimony you're not
[1:47:05] going to be cleaned by somebody else's

[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:05] right did you feel that for a second
[1:59:08] there did you feel that a song like
[1:59:10] David singing that could you imagine
[1:59:12] being David singing that why did he need
[1:59:15] such a renewing of his spirit it's
[1:59:18] because he was missing the
[1:59:20] joy so when you're missing and the
[1:59:23] joy and you know what I'm talking about
[1:59:25] you all know what it means to be happy
[1:59:27] oh yeah you don't need a seven part

[1:59:40] and that's what David is saying here why
[1:59:42] do I need my spirit renewed I need that

[2:07:53] amen the feeling in our heart did you
[2:07:55] feel even a little bit it this
[2:07:58] morning I hope my testimonies and listen
[2:08:01] I had to go back for myself this morning
[2:08:03] too I had to get back to when I was
[2:08:05] saved again I didn't realize how much I
[2:08:08] needed it just from a personal
[2:08:09] standpoint and I hope you did the same
[2:08:12] thing this morning you went back to some
[2:08:14] of those old testimonies that you can't
[2:08:17] explain right you can't understand you
[2:08:20] may not even you go how that possibly
[2:08:22] have happened but it did didn't it and
[2:08:25] here you are proof that it did
[2:08:28] happen and you can go back and say Lord
[2:08:30] if you did it
[2:08:33] then you did it then Lord then you still

[2:09:35] a little bit just so you know I feel
[2:09:38] great this
[2:09:39] morning I appreciate you all let me be a
[2:09:41] little bit me this morning because I've
[2:09:44] been saying how preachers are humans I
[2:09:46] was a little human to you this morning I
[2:09:47] needed it myself to get back to get
[2:09:50] saved again a little bit amen so I just
[2:09:54] feel like praising the Lord for what he
[2:09:56] did in my life saving me if you would
[2:09:59] have seen me 15 years ago you would have
[2:10:01] said there ain't no chance for that
[2:10:03] man but God looked at me and said I'm
[2:10:05] going to make a miracle out of
[2:10:09] [Applause]
[2:10:11] him can I say something to your mommy
[2:10:14] and daddies real quick just so you know
[2:10:15] this
[2:10:17] okay sometimes it can be hard those what
[2:10:20] those kids do
[2:10:22] they're going to mess up but did you
[2:10:23] know I was that
[2:10:24] kid and did you know I had a daddy
[2:10:27] praying for meise the Lord and did you
[2:10:29] know my dad had nothing to do with it
[2:10:31] when I finally got saved there you go
[2:10:34] and yet he was still praying on me
[2:10:35] there's one thing I'm I I'm going down
[2:10:37] this road for a
[2:10:39] reason one thing you got to make sure
[2:10:41] you do don't ever doubt God don't ever
[2:10:45] bring a condemnation Spirit ever
[2:10:48] Hallelujah there's one thing my dad
[2:10:50] never did to me me he never condemned me
[2:10:52] once for anything I did and I mean I did
[2:10:54] some pretty bad
[2:10:55] stuff but my dad never condemned me and
[2:10:59] God was able to fulfill that promise in
[2:11:02] my life you wonder if God can say
[2:11:05] because of a daddy's prayer he just
