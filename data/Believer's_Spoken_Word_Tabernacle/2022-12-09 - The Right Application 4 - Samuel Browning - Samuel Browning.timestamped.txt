[37:10] he's been moved to the I see you Lord
[37:13] and even how that they found things that
[37:15] did not show up the Lord previously but
[37:18] how we thank you God for moving for
[37:20] brother day O Lord in a special way and
[37:23] we ask that God Lord you just continue
[37:25] to keep your hand upon him in the
[37:27] congregation there Lord in Arizona Lord
[37:29] we ask o God that Lord you would just
[37:33] have your way now father
[37:35] you know our needs Lord we just give
[37:38] ourselves to you Lord along with every
[37:40] other request in Jesus name
[37:43] amen
[37:45] God bless you
[37:46] this evening
[37:48] if you'll turn with me to Job chapter 19
[37:50] there
[37:52] I'd like to say it's good to be back
[37:54] home
[37:56] um just so enjoyed the service I was
[37:59] able to
[38:00] listen to the service and just so
[38:04] enjoyed that
[38:05] and uh
[38:07] we just um just looking to the Lord amen
[38:11] and what God has in store for us here
[38:15] and uh
[38:17] I want to look I want to break in here
[38:19] in Job chapter 19 I want to just
[38:24] move into verse 8 and start right there
[38:28] um in this thought here in the going
[38:31] about this tonight and here's job he's
[38:34] he's ex he's expressing
[38:37] that when he speaks of he he's speaking
[38:40] of God in verse 8 he hath fenced up my
[38:45] way
[38:46] that I cannot pass
[38:49] and he hath set darkness in my paths you
[38:53] know
[38:54] there is truth to what job is saying
[38:57] because a trial itself is an ordained
[39:01] meeting place with God
[39:04] and the Bible says that there's no
[39:07] temptation that has taken us but such as
[39:10] what's common to man
[39:12] and there's no exit doors in those
[39:14] trials we look for them
[39:16] our flesh looks for him it's just true
[39:18] we look for them if there's one time we
[39:20] would like to have a trap door I'd like
[39:22] to be that time
[39:23] so there's a truth I want you to see
[39:27] this here as we look at it tonight you
[39:29] can see there are things that job he
[39:31] understands about God's nature but where
[39:34] Joe blacks is the understanding of
[39:37] what's taking place with me
[39:40] true and that's the that's a part of it
[39:42] that remember this is where he says he
[39:45] hath fenced up my way in other words
[39:46] there's no escaping out of this right
[39:48] here that I cannot pass and he hath set
[39:51] Darkness or removed understanding in my
[39:54] paths
[39:56] but it just goes to show in the midst of
[39:58] it all that we're not walking by
[40:00] understanding we do walk by
[40:02] understanding but we don't walk by
[40:04] understanding we walk by faith because
[40:06] faith is real understanding it's
[40:09] understanding to know that God is
[40:11] present I belong to him and he's guiding
[40:14] me that's the understanding we have need
[40:17] of right that's the understanding that
[40:19] where a change has come into our life
[40:21] that's real understanding not not this
[40:23] up here that I have all of this figured
[40:26] out but I've got an understanding that
[40:28] God is with me now in verse 9 he hath
[40:31] stripped me of my glory and taken the
[40:34] crown from my head he hath destroyed me
[40:38] on every side and I am gone and my hope
[40:42] hath he removed like a tree
[40:46] he all he hath also kindled his wrath
[40:49] against me and he counted me unto him as
[40:52] one of his enemies his troops come
[40:55] together and raise up their way against
[40:57] me and in Camp round about my Tabernacle
[41:00] he hath put my brethren far from me and
[41:04] mine and mine acquaintance are very
[41:07] estranged from me amen may God bless you
[41:11] and bless the reading of the word as
[41:13] you're being seated there this evening
[41:16] just want to by the help of the Lord
[41:19] just continue to look at that thought
[41:22] of a right application
[41:26] in the midst of that of a trial in the
[41:29] midst of situations and we know that
[41:30] there is a real we need the help of the
[41:33] Lord in applying the word correctly and
[41:36] looking at things correctly and the
[41:38] thing that we find within it all that
[41:41] which is so prevalent to misinterpret
[41:44] what's taking place is the enemy and
[41:47] there's a part of us that's that's kin
[41:50] to that of the enemy a part of us that's
[41:53] receptive to listen to that that's that
[41:57] that part even though we've been
[41:58] delivered of that first birth but that
[42:00] flesh and that Spirit can be moved and
[42:04] Satan can come and Whisper to that
[42:06] brother Brown talked about how that when
[42:08] Satan came there when his wife had
[42:10] passed and when his little girl and he's
[42:13] standing right there and brother Brahm
[42:14] said he came right up and stood right
[42:16] beside there and if you can you catch
[42:18] what brother Brown was saying is it's
[42:20] more than Satan standing right there by
[42:23] the side of that bed where little Sharon
[42:25] Rose was was at
[42:27] Satan had been standing there right next
[42:30] to his reasoning and was beginning to
[42:33] declare many different things to him he
[42:36] was rehearsing a lot of things to him
[42:38] and remember the very thing that brother
[42:40] Brown told us in that time this the
[42:42] testimony that he said Satan could not
[42:46] he could not tell me there was no God
[42:50] I already knew him
[42:53] but what he came in that moment was to
[42:57] try to convince him he doesn't love you
[43:01] he doesn't care about you
[43:03] and he's the same devil he doesn't have
[43:06] any new tactics he works the same way
[43:09] and the one thing about it is is God
[43:12] doesn't have to have any new tactics
[43:14] either God's given his word in the
[43:15] beginning and his word when we as
[43:18] Believers will take that word and stand
[43:19] on it it'll defeat the Devil any time
[43:23] any place and anywhere
[43:25] and that's the truth we're standing as
[43:27] Witnesses these aren't these aren't just
[43:29] things that we're quoting we're
[43:31] Witnesses of this
[43:33] we're expressing expressing of these of
[43:36] these things by an experience and this
[43:38] is where when we look at this thinking
[43:40] as brother Brandon would bring it and
[43:42] and you know speak to us that as long as
[43:46] Satan could make job believe that his
[43:50] sickness was his God doing it he had job
[43:53] whip in other words job did not
[43:56] understand that what is taking place God
[44:01] is Desiring to make something more out
[44:05] of you
[44:06] God is Desiring to bring forth something
[44:09] more out of you now once you think about
[44:12] this
[44:13] we could maybe accept this if we looked
[44:16] at it and said well job's a young man
[44:18] he's a middle-aged man the prophet tells
[44:20] us clearly job was he was an older man
[44:24] he was just a little a few few if we
[44:26] could say a few years from the grave
[44:29] but yet in the midst of it all it just
[44:32] goes to show you and I that we never
[44:34] come to a place on our own to where it's
[44:38] just I've reached a climax I've reached
[44:41] the summit I've read God has always
[44:44] there's always more that God has in
[44:46] store
[44:47] I can't say I fully understand all that
[44:50] I I there's no way because if you try to
[44:53] explain how is it that an individual can
[44:56] walk with God and maybe be 85 years old
[44:59] and they're taken home to be with the
[45:00] Lord and while they're here their
[45:02] character is being molded the whole time
[45:04] and then you take another life then here
[45:06] is changed and transformed and it's not
[45:09] here for that duration of time and yet
[45:11] it's on home to be with the Lord
[45:13] explain that you can't
[45:15] I can't explain that you can't explain
[45:18] the infinite wisdom of almighty God
[45:22] this is where we trust him this is trust
[45:26] comes from that reality that that love
[45:30] affair and it's not just that I'm in
[45:32] love or you're in love with an idea of
[45:34] God because that's the human spirit and
[45:37] that'll fail
[45:38] because when he begins to permit things
[45:42] that don't match our concept or that
[45:45] that depth of love that just resides in
[45:47] our spirit
[45:48] then it shakes a person to a place of
[45:51] departure but when the love of God has
[45:53] come into the soul
[45:56] then there's nothing can separate us
[46:06] of divine love
[46:08] because Divine love is is there and it
[46:11] stands that even when I don't understand
[46:14] what's taking place like job said I'm
[46:18] going to worship
[46:21] I'm going to worship
[46:23] and we're brought to those different
[46:25] places in our life sometimes they come
[46:28] in very precarious ways
[46:31] ways that were tried that we didn't even
[46:33] expect and it just can almost take the
[46:36] breath out of us and it isn't always
[46:38] something that we put in saying think
[46:40] something to be so devastating or maybe
[46:42] a sickness perhaps tonight if I'm if God
[46:46] permits me to refer to one I refer to
[46:49] one that even where the Prophet
[46:50] designates as an ash Heath that perhaps
[46:53] you or I would not have even thought of
[46:55] being an ass sheep but it lets us know
[46:58] all of these ways that you and I that
[47:01] God allows things to move and come about
[47:05] that it might draw us closer to him
[47:08] that we might be more of a yielded
[47:12] vessel to him
[47:14] because this whole life
[47:17] our whole life here it's not about
[47:19] ourselves
[47:21] the Bible says we are not our own we are
[47:23] bought with the price it's not about us
[47:25] and yet the greatest battle and the and
[47:28] where where the battle lays it's with us
[47:32] it's with us
[47:34] now he'll try to do the same thing as he
[47:37] did with job as long as he can make job
[47:39] believe it that way he had job whipped
[47:42] now not only were his friends and all
[47:46] those around him
[47:48] they were aligning themselves against
[47:51] him but it was Satan
[47:53] it was Satan moving that but job even in
[47:56] himself
[47:58] if you would even have expoke to job
[48:00] even in the midst of this time job would
[48:04] not have been a refreshing person to be
[48:08] around
[48:10] are you hearing me now he would not have
[48:12] been a refreshing person he would have
[48:15] been one that would have if we can say
[48:18] it in this way that could have almost
[48:19] taken your breath away
[48:21] by the things because as we find chapter
[48:25] after chapter after chapter job at
[48:28] different times would say my complaint
[48:30] I'm in the bitterness of soul and what
[48:31] I'm going through and all of that he had
[48:33] a right to all that
[48:35] he felt all of that bitterness are you
[48:37] hearing me he felt all of that Jesus
[48:40] said let this bitter cup pass for me no
[48:42] trial is Pleasant
[48:44] no test is Pleasant it's bitter
[48:47] right it's better it's not pleasant
[48:50] but it's where in the midst of it that
[48:54] we can receive a refreshing from the
[48:57] Lord in the midst of it is where we need
[49:00] the grace of God to help us Lord that my
[49:03] thoughts would be yielded to you Lord
[49:07] and looking to you
[49:13] I don't know sometimes that I have
[49:17] times when I've
[49:18] you know you try to encourage someone or
[49:20] this or that and sometimes it seems like
[49:22] in times that even you can express
[49:24] something and it's almost like it's like
[49:26] a black hole
[49:28] it goes in and there's there's nothing
[49:30] that even just comes out on the positive
[49:32] end
[49:33] so many can be going through something
[49:34] and you just give it to them yeah I know
[49:36] that but you know this is a real
[49:38] depressing situation and I'm not
[49:40] doubting that person or Downing that
[49:42] individual
[49:43] we all come into those moments where you
[49:46] feel down
[49:48] you feel a little discouraged you feel
[49:50] like what's going on I've just come
[49:51] through some of the what's going on here
[49:53] looking at certain things and what
[49:56] brings us through and our thoughts were
[49:58] the Battleground is the battle in our
[50:00] mind
[50:02] you can't discount our your thinking at
[50:05] all or make it as though it's not
[50:07] anything at all it is something and God
[50:09] wants us to have our thoughts so to
[50:13] lined up with him God let my thinking be
[50:15] under your influence Lord
[50:18] we need that Lord if my thoughts not
[50:21] right here tonight Lord may your
[50:23] presence come down lord and
[50:25] supernaturally Lead me as my shepherd
[50:28] Lord
[50:29] I need that
[50:32] our thinking matters because you if you
[50:35] are defeated or I am defeated in my
[50:39] thinking
[50:40] it'll affect your perception and it'll
[50:43] affect your confession
[50:44] your outlook on everything will be
[50:47] negative
[50:48] and your confession will be negative
[50:53] and we can all maybe some more than
[50:55] others but this we can be prone to these
[50:58] things but this is where to understand
[51:01] that is Satan's objective
[51:05] is to get us defeated in our thinking
[51:09] that's what he wanted to do to job
[51:12] because if he could get job's thinking
[51:14] off no matter how much Revelation was
[51:17] packed inside of his soul
[51:20] no matter how sealed and a son of God
[51:22] with authority that he was but if his
[51:25] thinking
[51:28] Satan caused him to believe it was God
[51:30] doing it to him he's got him whipped
[51:32] think about it power that resided within
[51:36] this life think about in your own life
[51:38] my life power that resides there Divine
[51:41] Authority
[51:43] but if Satan can affect our thinking
[51:46] he's got us
[51:48] Satan can affect the thinking in the
[51:51] service affect your thinking or my
[51:53] thinking even a service or even walking
[51:55] up here in any way if he can do that
[51:59] he can affect you
[52:02] he can affect me how much more in a
[52:05] trial
[52:07] this is why just think of this scripture
[52:09] I you know I've read from this scripture
[52:11] here many times
[52:13] it just struck me here today
[52:15] as I'm just just pouring over you know
[52:17] just been pouring over the Book of Job
[52:19] even as I've been out and on trips that
[52:21] just I just keep going over and just
[52:23] keep listening keep meditating keep
[52:25] going through these these things and
[52:27] there's just been some wonderful things
[52:28] of God by his grace will allow us to
[52:31] speak and move into But First Peter
[52:34] chapter 4 verse 12 don't you love the
[52:36] Lord
[52:37] look at this very first verse we know
[52:40] the scripture by Heart Right beloved
[52:43] think it not strange concerning
[52:45] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[52:46] try you as though some strange thing
[52:48] happened to you but what's important is
[52:50] beloved
[52:53] the very first word beloved
[52:57] who is that
[53:00] is that of the Beloved the esteemed the
[53:03] dear the favorite the worthy of love
[53:07] who is the Beloved you are the Beloved
[53:11] I am of the Beloved we have been
[53:13] accepted into beloved he who was lovable
[53:16] made us who was unlovable lovable
[53:22] we have been accepted in the Beloved and
[53:25] now by his life operating through that
[53:29] seed of himself in our life he says
[53:33] beloved
[53:37] this is why brother Brandon would say it
[53:39] like this thinking of and I want you to
[53:41] think about hear our thoughts and
[53:43] regarding tests and trials
[53:45] but the brand will say I like this the
[53:48] more loyal you are
[53:49] the more testings come
[53:52] this is out of the Messi's Victory down
[53:54] let me just pull a few statements on
[53:56] here more loyal more testing
[54:00] now I want to qualify testing and trials
[54:02] here in just a little bit more loyal
[54:04] more testing
[54:06] God think of these statements I want you
[54:09] to understand this
[54:10] when I'm reading this here in the
[54:12] message of the hour let me tell you
[54:13] where I believe we're standing we're
[54:15] standing in the same place where God
[54:18] spoke to job out of the Whirlwind
[54:22] because Allahu has stood up and he has
[54:24] taken the book The Lamb has prevailed
[54:27] and God is speaking here in job 42 what
[54:32] all of this has all been about it's been
[54:34] God trying and proving his church down
[54:37] Through the Ages and God working in your
[54:39] lives
[54:43] God think of this word this is at now an
[54:46] understanding that comes to you and I
[54:48] and I'm just going to say it like this
[54:50] not that they did not have understanding
[54:53] down through the seven Church ages there
[54:56] are many men that had understanding
[54:58] those Messengers had understanding
[55:00] regarding testings and trials because
[55:03] let me say this every Overcomer when it
[55:06] said he that half an ear and an every
[55:09] age to every Overcomer there was a test
[55:15] yeah and that test was the word
[55:20] they were tested upon that word that
[55:23] they had received and believed
[55:27] and you know what it was that did the
[55:28] Sorting that sorted everything
[55:31] is the word
[55:33] it's the word that brings the sorting
[55:35] out
[55:37] the sorting out because
[55:39] many can come around it but it's the
[55:42] word that does the sorting out
[55:44] because remember the word is a seed and
[55:47] it was thrown on four types of ground
[55:49] right but it's only the good ground
[55:52] which is the pre prepared ground that's
[55:56] ordained to receive that seed and it's
[55:59] not you or me or anyone that has done
[56:03] that it's God has placed and reserved
[56:06] that womb that expression that
[56:09] Candlestick God has reserved that place
[56:12] for himself that we might receive him in
[56:15] this hour so all glory goes to him
[56:19] because if not for God's grace this
[56:23] message would go right over our head
[56:26] we would view this message as no other
[56:28] thing than just another move of God we
[56:31] would view this message as oh it's just
[56:33] another view of Calvary that's how we
[56:36] would view it but when we can really
[56:37] recognize that this message it is Jesus
[56:41] Christ being revealed to me personally
[56:44] it's deeper than a religious affiliation
[56:49] hallelujah it's through this message
[56:52] that God is fulfilling in time
[56:56] prophecies where a people are united and
[56:59] take upon his name
[57:03] glory be to God no longer saying this
[57:06] shall be this shall be but we are able
[57:08] to say this now is
[57:14] and I say that
[57:16] with this understanding that God would
[57:19] issue out regarding test
[57:23] and trials
[57:25] what an understanding
[57:27] job didn't have this
[57:30] job didn't have this let me say this
[57:32] other ages didn't have this
[57:35] but God has reserved it
[57:38] because it's needed for right now
[57:41] that's why the lamb took the book it's
[57:43] needed for right now
[57:45] it's to invoke full Authority in the
[57:49] Church of the Living God
[57:50] think of this statement
[57:52] to me
[57:53] these statements here these statements
[57:55] this message is not from the mind of
[57:57] William Branham
[57:58] this meant these thoughts are from the
[58:00] very heart of Elohim
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:03] amen it's God standing before our tent
[58:06] door
[58:07] think of this think of this think of
[58:10] this being breathed into our life God
[58:12] has counted you Worthy
[58:15] when you have a test
[58:18] I want to know if I've had God's head I
[58:21] love you I've given you a test
[58:26] wow
[58:28] totally contrary to our thinking huh
[58:32] right I think he is if God really loves
[58:34] us then it ought to be smooth
[58:38] you know it's got to be putting without
[58:39] any bits of the mixture and I mean it's
[58:42] got to be Blended smooth
[58:45] all right
[58:48] one more statement in here it shows the
[58:51] grace of God has found you and you found
[58:53] favor with God
[58:55] and God believes that you'll stand the
[58:58] test
[58:59] he did the same thing by Joe brother
[59:01] Brown said this is what God said about
[59:03] job he's my pride and my joy
[59:08] who is he he beloved
[59:11] you see if you got around God God was
[59:14] going to talk about his children
[59:16] you think you got pictures of your
[59:18] grandchildren or pictures of your
[59:20] children nobody has God beat
[59:24] nobody has got to be God loves to show
[59:27] off his children
[59:31] he loves to show and display and that's
[59:35] what he was doing with Joe job let's
[59:37] beloved
[59:39] he's my pride and joy
[59:42] God had confidence in job the prophet
[59:44] said and when it looks like this is so
[59:46] important when it looks like everything
[59:48] has gone wrong
[59:50] how many know what I'm talking about I
[59:52] mean it looks like everything has gone
[59:55] wrong
[59:57] God has given you a trial he's got
[1:00:01] come after baby you around now you can
[1:00:04] understand
[1:00:06] God could have come right away
[1:00:09] in chapter three when job started after
[1:00:12] job worshiped in chapter one he turned
[1:00:14] and worshiped in chapter two and then
[1:00:16] the beginning of chapter three you think
[1:00:18] where'd this guy go he ain't singing
[1:00:20] specials no more
[1:00:22] where did he go now he wasn't he wasn't
[1:00:25] accused he wasn't coming out and cursing
[1:00:27] God
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:29] but he got after in the worship then you
[1:00:32] have a little bit of time in chapter
[1:00:34] three he says oh I would to God that the
[1:00:37] day had never come that I had been born
[1:00:41] let me tell you what all that's about
[1:00:44] job
[1:00:47] and God said that's why this trial is
[1:00:49] here
[1:00:51] because I got to get some selfishness
[1:00:52] out of you
[1:00:54] isn't it amazing isn't it amazing you or
[1:00:57] I we can look at it and think my what
[1:01:00] selfishness mine the most unselfish
[1:01:02] person in the world I don't know and
[1:01:04] then God allows something to come and
[1:01:06] what does it do it does not highlight
[1:01:08] the real quality of a Believer or expose
[1:01:11] that at first what it exposes is this
[1:01:15] flesh
[1:01:17] now job remember God said remember Satan
[1:01:19] said you let me touch his kids and I'll
[1:01:21] cause him to curse you let me take
[1:01:22] everything from him I'll cause him the
[1:01:24] curse you couldn't do it then he came
[1:01:26] around and said let me touch his flesh a
[1:01:28] man will give everything for his health
[1:01:29] he'll do everything in the world God
[1:01:31] said go ahead and do it but you can't
[1:01:32] take his life but notice here that shows
[1:01:35] there's still an element of
[1:01:37] self-preservation
[1:01:40] about us
[1:01:42] and you know what that will be there
[1:01:45] until the change of our bodies
[1:01:49] it is nothing that you'll ever come to a
[1:01:51] place or I will come to a place and will
[1:01:53] hang it up and saying man I'll never be
[1:01:56] bothered with that no but it's glory
[1:01:59] unto Glory
[1:02:01] God is dissolving it little
[1:02:04] by little
[1:02:05] by little
[1:02:08] and he knows just how to do it oh oh
[1:02:10] brother the same now you know there's
[1:02:11] got to be some real hard preaching no
[1:02:13] remember heart preaching only brings
[1:02:16] conviction
[1:02:17] right yeah but around lots of snow any
[1:02:19] adoption seriously said preaching itself
[1:02:21] is what brings conviction leading people
[1:02:23] to the altar to get right with God he
[1:02:25] said but it takes the teaching of the
[1:02:27] word to positionally place us now I
[1:02:30] believe the holy spirit is in both
[1:02:32] Realms don't you and I believe it's
[1:02:34] absolutely necessary we need the
[1:02:37] teaching of the word we need the
[1:02:38] preaching the word I believe God can
[1:02:40] bring it right together but notice this
[1:02:42] he doesn't have to baby you around
[1:02:44] you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid
[1:02:47] you're a real Christian God is giving
[1:02:50] you a test to see what you'll do about
[1:02:52] it then he quotes that of Peter and he
[1:02:55] says many times we him and Hall
[1:02:57] I don't we probably don't do that
[1:03:00] that's something God give you notice
[1:03:03] this that something God give you
[1:03:05] to overcome
[1:03:09] put his trust in you
[1:03:13] brother the rhyme goes on to say we fret
[1:03:15] about this but I want you to remember
[1:03:17] these trials come upon us and are only
[1:03:19] done because God loves us he give it to
[1:03:22] us because he's got confidence in us he
[1:03:24] believes that we have faith and love for
[1:03:26] him that will be able to overcome he'll
[1:03:29] see to it I love that
[1:03:31] he believes will overcome he'll seat to
[1:03:34] it
[1:03:34] you know what that means that when a
[1:03:36] test or trial comes along the way God
[1:03:39] does not abandon me
[1:03:42] he's right there with me though the
[1:03:46] paths seem dark and I cannot understand
[1:03:48] what's going on but that's the time when
[1:03:51] faith will really declare itself
[1:03:55] faith is not when I know everything
[1:03:57] that's going on when I got everything
[1:03:59] that's figured out do you realize that
[1:04:02] God the greatest thing that God is
[1:04:04] working with in our life is to get
[1:04:06] self-dissolved
[1:04:08] the biggest problem we've got is self oh
[1:04:11] no brother Sammy you got that wrong the
[1:04:13] biggest problem I've got is with so and
[1:04:15] so no it's with you it's not so and so
[1:04:18] you see what it is God allows that to
[1:04:21] come up to let you and I see there's
[1:04:24] still that part about you and I that has
[1:04:28] to die and be submitted to him
[1:04:31] and God will see to it that we overcome
[1:04:34] that you might be sitting here and it
[1:04:36] might be 30 some years later and say I
[1:04:38] still ain't got to be on this but God is
[1:04:41] very long-suffering he's patient he'll
[1:04:44] send test after a test trial after trial
[1:04:47] because God never gives up on himself
[1:04:52] glory be to God
[1:04:54] and sometimes what we cannot see then
[1:04:57] God comes along and he's giving us Grace
[1:05:03] well I love that statement he'll see us
[1:05:05] through
[1:05:05] and may we not fret and stew about it
[1:05:09] it's a powerful statement I don't know
[1:05:10] if I'll get to this tonight but may we
[1:05:12] just walk up there and speak the word
[1:05:15] and walk forward
[1:05:21] and they go on from there
[1:05:25] this is why the Bible would say for
[1:05:27] whatsoever is born of God
[1:05:30] overcometh the world
[1:05:33] and this is the victory
[1:05:35] that overcometh the world even our faith
[1:05:39] there have been times you feel like you
[1:05:40] got stuck
[1:05:42] sure
[1:05:43] you ever been in the midst of a test or
[1:05:45] trial and you feel like you got stuck
[1:05:46] there's a testing going on
[1:05:49] and you're battling there's thoughts and
[1:05:50] everything coming into your mind and
[1:05:52] everything else I know I'm speaking to
[1:05:54] humanity tonight Sons and Daughters of
[1:05:56] God that are veiled in humanity and in
[1:05:58] the midst of your battling and bringing
[1:06:00] that thought subject and bringing this
[1:06:01] thumbnail I'm bringing that how are you
[1:06:03] able to bring it subject because you're
[1:06:06] acquainted with the nature of Christ
[1:06:08] that's in you
[1:06:09] and you realize if I entertain that in
[1:06:12] that way it will move and it will
[1:06:15] absolutely defeat me
[1:06:19] My Confession will become negative
[1:06:22] my perception on things will become
[1:06:25] negative over the Samuel that's positive
[1:06:27] thinking well if you call that positive
[1:06:29] thinking you've got a lot of scriptures
[1:06:30] to take out of your Bible
[1:06:33] I call it the mind of Christ I don't
[1:06:35] find anywhere in the scripture you can
[1:06:37] find me if you want to text me tomorrow
[1:06:39] email to me tomorrow go ahead and do it
[1:06:41] find me one place where God ever
[1:06:43] instructed any of his children to walk
[1:06:46] around negative he said let the weak say
[1:06:49] I'm strong
[1:06:52] let the redeemed of the Lord say so
[1:06:57] right on and on we could go with
[1:06:59] scriptures
[1:07:01] so it's powerful that in our Faking It
[1:07:04] Matters our perception and then our
[1:07:06] confession because if Satan has us
[1:07:08] defeated in our thinking then might as
[1:07:10] well not even walk up there and speak
[1:07:12] the word because well I don't know I
[1:07:15] don't know if we should have came out of
[1:07:17] Egypt I tell you there's such big
[1:07:18] chariots and all that back no he didn't
[1:07:20] say go up there and reason with it
[1:07:22] speak the word
[1:07:27] for this is the victory that overcometh
[1:07:29] the world even our faith and sometimes
[1:07:31] we get stuck but thanks be to God
[1:07:34] faith
[1:07:36] is that motor
[1:07:38] that power in our life that like a boat
[1:07:41] when a boat gets stuck in in some weeds
[1:07:44] or over there you know it's it's fishing
[1:07:46] there's a power in that boat
[1:07:49] it's more than paddle power
[1:07:51] there's an engine behind it that's able
[1:07:53] to get it unstuck
[1:07:55] I'm glad that this engine is not able
[1:07:57] just to take us out into the deep but
[1:07:59] I'm glad it's able to get us unstuck
[1:08:02] when we get stuck because sometimes we
[1:08:04] get stuck in our own thinking and you
[1:08:06] know what that's overcoming
[1:08:09] don't make overcoming well I haven't
[1:08:11] walked on the water today find me the
[1:08:13] person who has
[1:08:15] because he walked on the water to let
[1:08:17] you and I know that there is Authority
[1:08:19] where we can walk above our first birth
[1:08:21] we can walk above and with authority and
[1:08:25] in Dominion in our life
[1:08:28] right but for the same I feel like I'm
[1:08:31] drowning reach up like Peter and say
[1:08:33] help me Lord lest I perish
[1:08:38] remember it's not the trial of my mind
[1:08:41] my spirit or my body it's the trial of
[1:08:44] my faith and they overcame him the Bible
[1:08:46] said by the blood of the lamb and the
[1:08:49] word of their testimony
[1:08:53] oh my is carrying off
[1:08:56] the victory that's what overcoming means
[1:08:58] it means to maintain the cause carry off
[1:09:01] the victory
[1:09:03] I believe that with all my heart that's
[1:09:04] what a Christian life is to be it's a
[1:09:06] Victorious Life
[1:09:08] it doesn't mean that we don't we don't
[1:09:10] experience letdown sometimes we do it
[1:09:13] doesn't mean that we win every single
[1:09:15] battle no we don't but the war's already
[1:09:17] been won
[1:09:18] you see the greatest the rule and the
[1:09:20] battle that matters the most that's
[1:09:22] already been won is that battle already
[1:09:24] down in the soul and reality that battle
[1:09:27] was already won it's just us receiving
[1:09:29] the Liberty that he already has
[1:09:31] purchased for us
[1:09:33] and then when that battle is said it'll
[1:09:35] settled on the inside then we've got
[1:09:37] God's soldier on the inside and then we
[1:09:40] have strength to move and navigate
[1:09:42] through all these other channels where
[1:09:45] the enemy would like to come right back
[1:09:46] in but those are all opportunities to
[1:09:49] overcome
[1:09:50] now think of this through all of these
[1:09:52] things God will allow
[1:09:55] strange things
[1:09:56] he says it
[1:09:58] just to happen that we do not understand
[1:10:01] and we can't understand it but by faith
[1:10:04] because we do not walk by understanding
[1:10:06] we walk by faith
[1:10:09] is that right and so everything that God
[1:10:13] does in the midst of a time after after
[1:10:16] that our lives have been given become
[1:10:18] his property our confession our baptism
[1:10:21] and our promise to walk in life for him
[1:10:22] then every child that comes is to
[1:10:24] perfect us for his glory to bring us to
[1:10:27] a place to where God can make himself
[1:10:30] more real to us
[1:10:34] brother Branham ends that part with this
[1:10:36] statement and remember he says in all
[1:10:40] these things
[1:10:41] Satan tries to make us nervous
[1:10:47] oh
[1:10:48] so in a time of not understanding Satan
[1:10:51] comes to make us nervous
[1:10:53] you ought to back that Old Devil up
[1:10:55] tonight because that nervousness doesn't
[1:10:57] speak anything about you as a son or
[1:10:59] daughter of God are you hearing me no
[1:11:02] all that means is you're still trapped
[1:11:04] in this flesh something has come up and
[1:11:07] there can be a thought or a thought and
[1:11:09] we can entertain that thought and we
[1:11:11] take that and we become nervous oh
[1:11:13] brother Samuel if people only had the
[1:11:15] faith to keep it away just sit tight
[1:11:16] you'll have to deal with it sometime and
[1:11:18] when you deal with it then it's an
[1:11:20] opportunity to overcome
[1:11:22] because it can come but thanks be to God
[1:11:25] there is a tower down on the inside
[1:11:29] that's able to hear from God and when
[1:11:32] there's another thought that is
[1:11:34] transmitted and we can benefit from that
[1:11:37] what does it do perfect love cast out
[1:11:39] all fear
[1:11:43] Oh Glory Satan tries to make us nervous
[1:11:46] and upset us
[1:11:48] probably not any of us but to get us to
[1:11:52] to get us to think why did this happen
[1:11:57] why couldn't I
[1:11:59] have been like this
[1:12:03] now what brother Brown's talking about
[1:12:04] right here is an ash Heap in this
[1:12:08] message it's a short message I know if
[1:12:09] you get a chance to listen to it 59
[1:12:11] minutes I've probably listened to it I
[1:12:12] don't know how many times a year in the
[1:12:14] past few months wonderful what a
[1:12:16] blessing
[1:12:17] but brother Ram talks about an ash Heap
[1:12:19] now I'll be honest with you when I first
[1:12:20] listened to it
[1:12:21] you know I'm rejoicing but it blew me
[1:12:24] away I thought I would have never have
[1:12:26] regarded this as an ash Heap you know
[1:12:28] what it was he was invited to tour Oral
[1:12:32] Roberts facility
[1:12:34] he walks into that facility and he tells
[1:12:37] us he had just finished coming out of
[1:12:38] Tommy Osmond's remember both of them got
[1:12:41] their start out from underneath brother
[1:12:43] Branham
[1:12:45] are you with me what they saw was the
[1:12:47] god of reality remember what Tommy
[1:12:48] Osborne if you you read what Tommy
[1:12:49] Osborne I've got it at home in a in a
[1:12:51] testament or more of the Tommy Osborne
[1:12:53] speaks of it in this manner he said we
[1:12:55] had forgot what Jesus Christ was like
[1:12:57] and God came in this generation and now
[1:12:59] we know exactly what he was like one
[1:13:02] making brother random Jesus Christ but
[1:13:04] it was Christ reproduced in the ministry
[1:13:07] of Malachi 4. that is Luke 17 and 30.
[1:13:11] but I'm glad it didn't stop there it's
[1:13:12] that same Ministry reproduced in The
[1:13:14] Bride of Jesus Christ for the works that
[1:13:16] I do shall you do also and greater than
[1:13:18] these right
[1:13:21] but notice this ashy we wouldn't have
[1:13:23] thought of that I wouldn't have but
[1:13:25] brother Brown tells us he went out of
[1:13:27] there and when he left out of that
[1:13:29] building what brother Brown himself he
[1:13:31] said I looked around and he said I
[1:13:34] thought when I came out of there and I
[1:13:35] seen them great pillars and all that was
[1:13:38] in the building all those things that
[1:13:39] was going on what a beautiful structure
[1:13:41] brother Brown says I looked at all that
[1:13:43] right there and he says what I thought
[1:13:46] was God surely I have become a hypocrite
[1:13:51] surely I have become an outcast
[1:13:53] somewhere for these men's Ministries
[1:13:56] come off of mine
[1:13:59] I ask you was this the right application
[1:14:02] no
[1:14:04] let me just read on and I thought
[1:14:07] what maybe I am so untrusted Lord that
[1:14:13] you couldn't trust me with anything like
[1:14:14] that even the little few dollars that
[1:14:17] you let me pay for the campaigns and
[1:14:18] things now they're trying to send me to
[1:14:21] the penitentiary for it remember he's in
[1:14:22] the tax case and why am I such a
[1:14:24] hypocrite or why am I such an untrusted
[1:14:28] person brother said I was on the ash
[1:14:31] Heap as job was
[1:14:34] oh so sometimes the ash heaps look
[1:14:37] entirely different
[1:14:39] but you know what it is it's all
[1:14:41] personal God knows what's needed
[1:14:44] to dissolve
[1:14:46] these things in US
[1:14:48] now think about this because we look at
[1:14:50] a test or trial well I don't have no I
[1:14:52] don't have no choice a test or trial
[1:14:53] just comes brother Bram had a choice
[1:14:55] whether he wanted to visit this place or
[1:14:57] not
[1:14:58] come on coming home he had a choice
[1:15:00] whether he wanted to visit that place or
[1:15:02] not God wasn't telling that you're going
[1:15:04] to go to oral Robert's place and you're
[1:15:06] going to go see Tommy no this was just
[1:15:09] like
[1:15:10] passing through and seeing something and
[1:15:13] here he is passing through and seeing it
[1:15:15] and right in the midst of it
[1:15:19] his thoughts
[1:15:21] on the ash sheep his thoughts
[1:15:23] I must be a hypocrite
[1:15:25] I must be an untrusted person
[1:15:29] but then
[1:15:31] God speaks to him
[1:15:34] he says I want you to look up
[1:15:36] I am your portion
[1:15:41] did you see his thoughts his thoughts
[1:15:44] were affecting his confession it was
[1:15:47] affecting his perception but he was able
[1:15:51] to receive from God oh friends
[1:15:54] God's not going to stop the tests and
[1:15:56] trials and the hardships and things that
[1:15:58] come around our life but what is
[1:16:00] important is is that we can remain
[1:16:03] available
[1:16:04] to receive from God
[1:16:07] oh brother Samuel I'm just going to wait
[1:16:09] and close it all down I I just need to
[1:16:12] talk to you in person I need to talk why
[1:16:13] close this out
[1:16:15] God is mindful of our needs
[1:16:18] many times we forsake our mercies
[1:16:21] because we're looking for some answer to
[1:16:24] come in some way and God is ministering
[1:16:26] service after service and time and time
[1:16:29] again but we're sitting there and
[1:16:31] because it's not agreeing
[1:16:34] with us
[1:16:36] we wait for a different answer well let
[1:16:38] me tell you something God don't change
[1:16:40] his mind
[1:16:42] God don't change his mind and I am a
[1:16:44] firm believer I am a famous of it that
[1:16:47] if you pray I'm praying I believe that
[1:16:49] God directs and I know God directs God
[1:16:52] will change thoughts God will change
[1:16:54] things right here at the local church
[1:16:56] just as at times when I've been out why
[1:16:58] it's for the needs of his people because
[1:17:01] Ministry is not about me speaking the
[1:17:05] things that God maybe has revealed or
[1:17:07] made known to my heart it's about what
[1:17:10] are the needs of the people
[1:17:13] there's been many times where things
[1:17:15] have dropped in such a way and I'm
[1:17:17] studying and going through and Gathering
[1:17:19] as fast as I can gather it and God don't
[1:17:21] even have me to preach that for that
[1:17:22] time I don't know when it will be
[1:17:25] and oh I'm rejoicing of that and I
[1:17:28] realize I want to look at it Lord do I
[1:17:30] bring that to to this group do I bring
[1:17:31] that in
[1:17:33] I can't feel that Liberty
[1:17:35] you see that's why Ministry it's not
[1:17:38] about preaching what I'm seeing
[1:17:41] it's God ministering to our needs
[1:17:45] and God will lead God will lead right
[1:17:47] through the local Pastor God will direct
[1:17:49] all that and you watch watch how God
[1:17:50] will direct everything right through the
[1:17:52] local pastor and watch how God God is
[1:17:55] working throughout the body of Jesus
[1:17:57] Christ around the world and there are
[1:17:59] things that God will continue and
[1:18:01] everything will be lining up and
[1:18:02] bringing that same angle that same
[1:18:04] direction why because we are under one
[1:18:07] Pillar of Fire
[1:18:09] right might be a few different quotes
[1:18:11] might be but notice there are certain
[1:18:13] things and you know how it is you look
[1:18:15] around you turn around like oh my
[1:18:16] goodness what is that that's God letting
[1:18:19] you know hey I'm leading this bride this
[1:18:22] bride is not a man-made organism this
[1:18:26] Bride is a living a living vassal of
[1:18:30] almighty God as a matter of fact the
[1:18:32] prophet called it an oracle of God in
[1:18:34] this hour
[1:18:35] think of it I am your portion and then
[1:18:39] brother Branham began to worship and
[1:18:40] begin to thank God
[1:18:43] well I've Got Confidence I know I know
[1:18:45] how God's changed my thoughts many times
[1:18:46] how about you
[1:18:47] I know when God you know what that's the
[1:18:49] expectation I have I have need of that
[1:18:51] when my thoughts and maybe my thoughts
[1:18:53] on battling and bringing this sense of
[1:18:54] objection bringing this but I look at
[1:18:56] and say God I have a need from you Lord
[1:18:59] I have a need from you I need to hear
[1:19:01] from you Lord
[1:19:03] so jobs thinking regarding
[1:19:06] the whole thing his thinking was wrong
[1:19:09] it was actually God that was permitting
[1:19:11] him but notice
[1:19:13] job's thinking though his thinking was
[1:19:15] wrong and I want you to catch this his
[1:19:17] thinking was wrong
[1:19:19] but it's very incredible
[1:19:21] how he had such understanding
[1:19:23] that God was the one in control
[1:19:26] I could show you scripture after
[1:19:28] scripture and hear job 19 that's what
[1:19:31] he's saying he hath
[1:19:33] he knew this couldn't happen unless God
[1:19:35] permitted it
[1:19:37] I could not be turned over into the
[1:19:39] hands of the wicked unless God permitted
[1:19:41] it he knew that but he had the wrong
[1:19:43] application
[1:19:46] a man that can know what is truth
[1:19:48] knowing what is right he had met God he
[1:19:50] knew God's requirement but yet he did
[1:19:52] not have under he did not have
[1:19:54] understanding as what was going on that
[1:19:57] God was making something out of his life
[1:19:59] yet his thinking his thinking was being
[1:20:02] affected by the enemy
[1:20:07] because
[1:20:08] are you with me you're thinking and my
[1:20:11] thinking is not sealed
[1:20:13] your spirit and my spirit is not sealed
[1:20:17] the soul is what gets sealed
[1:20:20] brother Branham Will Tell Us in greatest
[1:20:21] by ever thought he said Satan he said
[1:20:23] once he's been put out the soldier has
[1:20:26] stepped in he said if he can get down
[1:20:28] one of those senses reason imagination
[1:20:30] conscience memory he said if he can get
[1:20:32] down in there he's got you routed
[1:20:36] now he cannot change and undo the new
[1:20:38] birth he can't
[1:20:40] because there's nothing to go back to
[1:20:42] but what he would like to do is get him
[1:20:44] routed and get our perceptions and such
[1:20:47] a certain way
[1:20:49] oh brother Samuel that can't happen
[1:20:51] really brother man just takes one
[1:20:52] example and they're an imagination he
[1:20:54] said you get somebody he said that maybe
[1:20:55] in the church he said you get the
[1:20:57] thinking that they've walked by you and
[1:20:58] not shook your hand he said and you
[1:20:59] watch you start acting funny
[1:21:02] towards that individual he said what is
[1:21:04] it you've just imagined it
[1:21:07] however you know you might talk to
[1:21:09] somebody I could call Brother Joshua but
[1:21:10] the Joshua he said no Sarah I'm willing
[1:21:13] to stand on it they ignored me so what
[1:21:15] are you going to do about it
[1:21:16] what are you gonna do about it you're
[1:21:17] gonna pout about it you're gonna get on
[1:21:19] Facebook about it tell everybody else
[1:21:20] about it you're going to let it ruin
[1:21:21] your testimony oh but it ain't mine it's
[1:21:23] showing Souls really what's
[1:21:26] what's I think you think rounded Satan
[1:21:30] has got the arousing that he wanted
[1:21:34] oh but sometimes those Ash heaps don't
[1:21:37] look like ash heaps
[1:21:39] but the ash heaps are places to die
[1:21:44] you ever heard there's a place you know
[1:21:46] when I taught school we had a phrase I
[1:21:48] don't know it's not just for school but
[1:21:49] you pick your battles
[1:21:51] pick your battles you can make
[1:21:53] everything in the world a battle but let
[1:21:55] me tell you something there's a place to
[1:21:56] live and die there's a hill to live and
[1:21:58] die on and not every Hill was meant to
[1:22:00] live and die on
[1:22:02] are you hearing me
[1:22:04] now Lord I don't feel like I've gone
[1:22:05] even anywhere tonight
[1:22:07] let me just let me just try to close up
[1:22:09] here on this part
[1:22:11] but I said here it was when he's talking
[1:22:13] about Israel coming out
[1:22:16] to Jordan
[1:22:17] I want you to listen this very carefully
[1:22:19] he said here it was
[1:22:21] that the Red Sea is before him
[1:22:24] he said now you think about it it's only
[1:22:27] a few years later when the Trials come
[1:22:30] and the church got All Shook Up
[1:22:32] as it's so easy for a Congregation of
[1:22:35] people to do when something just don't
[1:22:37] seem to happen the way that it's
[1:22:39] supposed to be
[1:22:41] now you catch that it's easy for a
[1:22:44] congregation to be so shaken up when
[1:22:46] things don't happen
[1:22:49] the way
[1:22:50] that it's supposed to be or don't seem
[1:22:55] we got quiet
[1:22:57] you ready for this next statement
[1:22:59] God makes it that way
[1:23:04] you mean God in one calling around and
[1:23:06] saying Hey do you understand this Hey
[1:23:08] Brother change sisterly can I come over
[1:23:09] I want to make sure you understand
[1:23:10] everything hey Mr Brenda hey Paul
[1:23:12] remember no
[1:23:14] God does it that way
[1:23:16] you know why
[1:23:18] because it shows
[1:23:20] believers
[1:23:22] it shows God allows things to happen
[1:23:26] God allows that
[1:23:30] God allows it
[1:23:33] matter of fact here's what he said I
[1:23:35] just read it God makes it that way so
[1:23:37] it's not like God fumbling around like
[1:23:39] oh
[1:23:41] my goodness I didn't mean for that to
[1:23:43] happen no God makes it happen that way
[1:23:49] remember he's a god of purpose
[1:23:53] listen to this next statement God brings
[1:23:56] tensions into the church
[1:24:00] God brings tensions into the church
[1:24:06] now Lord you know my heart I'm not
[1:24:08] asking for this
[1:24:10] I'm just preaching as you're servant
[1:24:12] what's you you're laying on my heart I'm
[1:24:14] not asking for it because I don't like
[1:24:16] tensions
[1:24:18] I don't like them
[1:24:20] I mean I don't got too much more hair to
[1:24:22] go
[1:24:24] notice he let sickness strike you he
[1:24:28] lets diseases come on you
[1:24:31] to test you and to prove you to show the
[1:24:35] world
[1:24:36] that you're truly
[1:24:38] the Seed of Abraham
[1:24:41] he permits it by his own will
[1:24:46] he permits disasters
[1:24:48] he permits the friends to turn against
[1:24:50] you
[1:24:53] he permits all these things and turns
[1:24:55] the devil loose to tempt you
[1:25:00] and he'll do all but take your life
[1:25:03] he could throw you on a bed of
[1:25:05] affliction
[1:25:06] he could turn your neighbors against you
[1:25:09] he could turn the church against you
[1:25:12] he can do most anything
[1:25:15] and it's God's will
[1:25:17] for him to do it
[1:25:23] he really brings the perspective because
[1:25:25] what happens in these times for every
[1:25:27] one of us including this old boy right
[1:25:30] here
[1:25:31] self
[1:25:33] Rises up
[1:25:35] self
[1:25:37] so and so shouldn't have said that this
[1:25:40] shouldn't have happened oh if they
[1:25:43] really have the love of God
[1:25:48] let me guess that they would act like
[1:25:51] you just did
[1:25:52] or you mean they would throw a fit like
[1:25:54] you did
[1:25:55] oh no I get it I see when the enemy came
[1:25:58] with that thought they would have threw
[1:25:59] a fit at the Devil said
[1:26:01] that's what you're acting out right
[1:26:08] you see what it does
[1:26:10] it shows self
[1:26:14] as much as we can walk around and say
[1:26:16] I'm nothing we still believe we're
[1:26:19] something
[1:26:21] you just want to know how it shows when
[1:26:23] a test or trial comes
[1:26:25] certain words come our way there's quote
[1:26:27] after quote and I don't know and you
[1:26:29] know I just know there's certain things
[1:26:31] that I've read and I maybe have read
[1:26:32] this no doubt I've read this quote
[1:26:34] before I've read many of these quotes
[1:26:35] but you know how it is the spirit of God
[1:26:36] can just cause things to stand out to
[1:26:38] you before like it never stood out
[1:26:40] and as I read through the Book of Job
[1:26:41] how many chapters and that we've been
[1:26:43] through so far here in chapter 19 and I
[1:26:46] still didn't even get to where we were
[1:26:47] going
[1:26:48] but how many times even with this
[1:26:50] opening text that he writes about his
[1:26:52] friends being removed from him
[1:26:54] his close acquaintances
[1:26:57] even those that should have he should
[1:27:00] have received impression and
[1:27:02] encouragement from instead they accused
[1:27:04] him
[1:27:05] and remember in the one chapter they
[1:27:06] said by the way
[1:27:08] all of everything that happened to you
[1:27:10] it didn't even measure what you deserved
[1:27:13] you know I read that to you
[1:27:16] wow what encouraging words from a buddy
[1:27:19] right
[1:27:23] dear friend
[1:27:27] but you know it shows there's so much
[1:27:31] of self
[1:27:32] but this is what I'm thankful for
[1:27:34] I'm grateful that God not only included
[1:27:36] these examples but I'm glad he's working
[1:27:39] on me
[1:27:42] I'm glad he's working on me
[1:27:43] because you know what God allows Samuel
[1:27:46] to come in situations that brings to
[1:27:48] light one thing too much of you boy
[1:27:51] too much of you
[1:27:52] and you know what the fun thing of it is
[1:27:54] you can be aware of it write what's
[1:27:56] going on man you know in the midst of it
[1:27:57] you're saying Lord help me
[1:28:01] help me Lord help me what are you doing
[1:28:04] bringing your thoughts those thoughts in
[1:28:08] subjection remember with your thoughts
[1:28:12] you can be defeated
[1:28:14] brother Branham stood outside of those
[1:28:17] great things of Oral Roberts and in his
[1:28:20] thinking he was defeated
[1:28:22] but he was available
[1:28:25] for God to speak to him
[1:28:29] to me it's what a paradox what a mystery
[1:28:32] in our lives but you know what it causes
[1:28:34] me to do it causes me that when I come
[1:28:36] here to the house of God when I look in
[1:28:38] the word of God I'm expecting for God to
[1:28:40] speak to me
[1:28:42] I know that he knows what I got need of
[1:28:44] yeah and I'm expecting him to speak to
[1:28:47] me that's what my thoughts are
[1:28:49] regardless of what my feelings are my
[1:28:51] thoughts of the of the day I'm expecting
[1:28:54] God
[1:28:55] to speak to us
[1:28:58] to us oh I love him don't you
[1:29:02] Lord let my thinking
[1:29:04] be influenced Lord by you
[1:29:08] let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:29:13] Lord Jesus
[1:29:19] Here We Stand Lord
[1:29:22] and what job Lord himself
[1:29:26] is going through is dealing with
[1:29:30] each and every one of us Lord had to are
[1:29:33] or will
[1:29:35] and Lord how I'm so thankful that
[1:29:38] we can be reminded
[1:29:40] and refreshed
[1:29:43] in these things Lord
[1:29:46] words of encouragement
[1:29:49] we'll never get to a place
[1:29:51] to where Lord it comes just like as
[1:29:54] though we pull into a certain gear and
[1:29:57] oh
[1:29:58] oh I know this now and this trial this
[1:30:01] is wow this trial is nothing no no no
[1:30:03] because the trial itself
[1:30:06] it comes
[1:30:08] to make something out of us
[1:30:10] your Prophet tells us that over and over
[1:30:12] and over it comes that we might be
[1:30:15] further strengthened than you than Lord
[1:30:18] I'm a know of it and I know the people
[1:30:19] sitting here know it as well in order
[1:30:21] for there to be more of your strength
[1:30:22] and there's got to be less of Samuel
[1:30:24] there's got to be less of me Lord they
[1:30:27] can put their name right in it
[1:30:29] and Lord Jesus you know that we need
[1:30:31] that Divine assistance Lord
[1:30:34] we need it
[1:30:35] Lord
[1:30:36] the part about us would pick the easy
[1:30:38] road that not the soul not the soul
[1:30:41] but that flesh part of us oh my
[1:30:44] God would pick the easy way we don't
[1:30:46] want Lord to have uncomfortable
[1:30:49] situations
[1:30:51] we don't want to have Lord
[1:30:54] misunderstandings we do not want to have
[1:30:57] things said about us nobody does part
[1:31:01] but God I pray that you would help us
[1:31:03] take these Lord thoughts Lord that
[1:31:06] you've placed on My Heart Lord
[1:31:08] and would speak to us in such a way to
[1:31:11] encourage us and help us to see that
[1:31:13] Lord that the trial itself help us Lord
[1:31:16] even as we take from this service and we
[1:31:18] pray over it Lord to realize Lord
[1:31:21] sometimes the things that can happen and
[1:31:23] are going around
[1:31:25] Lord It's All About Us dying to self
[1:31:31] help me Lord
[1:31:33] help me Lord is my prayer
[1:31:36] Lord God there's been a lot of things
[1:31:38] the Lord that
[1:31:39] you've showed me and I know by that
[1:31:41] there's a lot more other things Lord
[1:31:44] I need your grace Lord
[1:31:47] this congregation we need your grace
[1:31:49] Lord Jesus
[1:31:50] Lord God for in times we do not know
[1:31:53] sometimes Lord when an ash we might be
[1:31:56] on an ash Heap and it will come unawares
[1:31:59] to us because that's how the ash Heap
[1:32:01] does but it's on that ashy Lord where
[1:32:05] you choose to make yourself so real to
[1:32:09] us Lord more real to us Lord God
[1:32:12] help us Lord I pray help every one of us
[1:32:15] Lord
[1:32:16] help us the Lord I pray God may be here
[1:32:19] tonight Lord in one's thinking Lord and
[1:32:22] thoughts that the Lord has just went on
[1:32:24] and on Lord in their mind maybe looking
[1:32:26] at scenarios and situations and looking
[1:32:28] at things Lord maybe it seems like Lord
[1:32:31] that the Lord people are against him I
[1:32:33] thank Lord hear Lord God some Lord past
[1:32:36] meetings ago I had a little sister that
[1:32:39] came up Lord at the end of the service
[1:32:41] in meetings elsewhere and she came up
[1:32:44] Lord after and prayed for many different
[1:32:46] people and here she stood and what a
[1:32:48] Godly looking little sister and she
[1:32:50] stood right there and she said
[1:32:52] brother Samuel she said I need a touch
[1:32:55] in my body and she said I've been in
[1:32:57] this church for years and years and
[1:33:01] years
[1:33:02] but Satan wants to make me think nobody
[1:33:04] loves me
[1:33:06] Lord God you know Lord as I entered
[1:33:10] there in prayer it was the Lord Satan
[1:33:12] Lord there had worked through many many
[1:33:15] many
[1:33:16] situations though she set with the
[1:33:19] congregation
[1:33:20] but by entertaining those thoughts
[1:33:23] Lord God even though she did not go out
[1:33:26] in the world there I believe God a real
[1:33:28] experience in her life but it is so
[1:33:29] isolated her from the joy
[1:33:32] of the body
[1:33:34] but Lord You Came
[1:33:36] you came Lord
[1:33:39] and Lord God how we're so thankful Lord
[1:33:43] that in these moments Lord that you come
[1:33:46] to us we're not ignorant of Satan's
[1:33:48] devices because of your grace Lord
[1:33:52] help us Lord sometimes we don't always
[1:33:54] recognize it right away
[1:33:56] brother Branham did not recognize
[1:33:58] walking out of Oral Roberts would be an
[1:34:01] ash Heap
[1:34:02] he did not recognize it for that no
[1:34:04] doubt he may be gone up that morning
[1:34:06] there was plans coming out of that
[1:34:07] meeting to go visit that place who would
[1:34:10] have thought
[1:34:13] Lord I know when I've listened to that
[1:34:15] message and then Lord it was some time
[1:34:17] ago Lord I remember stopping at that day
[1:34:19] and thinking what and I went back and
[1:34:22] Lord I just begin my heart just began to
[1:34:24] open and say thank you Lord
[1:34:27] you show us
[1:34:29] that Lord the ash Heap is not our
[1:34:31] conception of things
[1:34:33] but the ash Heap is a place
[1:34:36] of death
[1:34:38] where we are LED as a lamb to the
[1:34:43] slaughter
[1:34:44] help us Lord
[1:34:47] because the Real Enemy that we have
[1:34:50] is our own selves
[1:34:52] it's us that gets in the way Lord
[1:34:55] but Lord I know you're here to help us
[1:34:57] and remind us and encourage us tonight
[1:34:59] and Lord
[1:35:00] thank you for dropping thoughts down
[1:35:03] Lord God your thoughts tonight and Lord
[1:35:06] in every service Lord should you tarry
[1:35:08] in Sunday's service Thursday service go
[1:35:10] Lord we need you Lord
[1:35:13] we need you Lord there's many lives the
[1:35:15] Lord is coming here Lord some not only
[1:35:18] attest your trials but some Lord God
[1:35:20] trapped in sin may need a thought to
[1:35:22] drop the Lord

[1:35:27] your children we need you Lord

[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:45] oh praise the Lord
[1:35:49] oh my don't you love him
[1:35:53] aren't you thankful he just comes in at
[1:35:55] all control reminds us and speaks to us
[1:35:57] of these things it encourages us it
[1:35:59] encourages me
[1:36:01] you know what I told you and I know I
[1:36:02] thought there as I sat there and I'm
[1:36:03] looking been looking over things I
[1:36:04] thought Lord I know the people are
[1:36:06] praying
[1:36:08] as a matter of fact when I got there in
[1:36:10] different times
[1:36:12] the brothers were sitting around there
[1:36:13] in Mexico he said brother Samuel speak
[1:36:16] about these things
[1:36:18] that God's been dealing Ministry
[1:36:22] on job in those services
[1:36:27] kind of feel a little odd you're sitting
[1:36:28] around in a circle and they're wanting
[1:36:29] you to express and go through these
[1:36:31] things but you know what it is
[1:36:34] it's encouragement to our lives
[1:36:39] encouragement
[1:36:41] God knows for just what we need
[1:36:45] I think when I was there the time before
[1:36:47] last didn't know what I was going to
[1:36:48] speak
[1:36:49] and God began to lay certain things on
[1:36:51] my life on my heart
[1:36:53] little did I know some of the things
[1:36:54] that I'd be speaking about in that time
[1:36:56] well
[1:36:57] the church at that time was going
[1:37:00] through many different things
[1:37:02] but then
[1:37:04] less
[1:37:05] than a week later or just a week later
[1:37:09] we would have this situation that we had
[1:37:11] where
[1:37:12] Ryan Walker went on home to be with the
[1:37:14] Lord
[1:37:16] trial
[1:37:17] test
[1:37:18] right
[1:37:20] that God knows
[1:37:22] I'm just so thankful that we can draw
[1:37:25] strength from him
[1:37:27] oh he is El Shady eye
[1:37:30] we can draw strength from him I may not
[1:37:32] know what is going on I may not have the
[1:37:34] understanding but in the midst of it I
[1:37:36] can take this that God has given to us
[1:37:39] but I do understand this
[1:37:42] I found favor with God
[1:37:44] when a trial has come you found favor
[1:37:47] with God
[1:37:48] as a matter of fact brother Brandon
[1:37:49] would word it like this and how can I
[1:37:50] overcome he said the test is the
[1:37:53] greatest thing
[1:37:54] to ever happen to you
[1:37:57] wow
[1:38:00] I don't know about you but I say wow
[1:38:02] right
[1:38:04] can I give you one more
[1:38:06] brother Graham said we ask God for peace
[1:38:08] and comfort and he gives us the best
[1:38:11] that he could give us
[1:38:13] tests trials and tribulation wait wait
[1:38:17] wait wait wait wait wait wait I asked
[1:38:18] him for peace and comfort
[1:38:20] but he gave me the best
[1:38:23] test trials and tribulation now this
[1:38:27] same message yeah he said because our
[1:38:30] peace comes
[1:38:32] on the other side
[1:38:35] but you see what that's all about
[1:38:37] right here
[1:38:39] don't you like it when things are going
[1:38:40] good
[1:38:41] hey I do I'll just be honest I love when
[1:38:43] things are going good I love when things
[1:38:45] are running real smooth don't you
[1:38:46] sisters love it when you're preparing
[1:38:48] that meal everything's going just right
[1:38:49] man everything it's real good isn't it
[1:38:53] well it's hard when everything's not
[1:38:54] lining up right the biscuits are getting
[1:38:56] burnt and the dogs wanting outside oh
[1:38:59] what's going on right
[1:39:03] you see it's not how we think
[1:39:06] that's not how we think brother Shane
[1:39:08] [Music]
[1:39:10] but God brother bear says puts bits
[1:39:13] in the mouth of that test or trial
[1:39:16] and he directs it for his glory
[1:39:19] because this whole part of our journey
[1:39:21] right here
[1:39:22] it's a Proving Grounds
[1:39:25] it's the molding grounds
[1:39:28] that's what this whole journey
[1:39:30] is about
[1:39:33] but yes do we like peace do we like
[1:39:36] Comfort I do I do
[1:39:39] right the Bible said follow peace with
[1:39:41] all Man Without such no one shall see
[1:39:42] God
[1:39:43] right
[1:39:44] live peaceably with each man as much as
[1:39:46] pot and that lies within you
[1:39:49] I believe in that I love peace
[1:39:51] I love peace I don't I don't love to
[1:39:53] argue I don't love the fuss I don't like
[1:39:55] to debate I I'm I don't like that
[1:39:58] I'm not the kind of guy well let me
[1:39:59] prove you on that's just not me that
[1:40:01] ain't Lord that's just not me
[1:40:03] I don't I love peace
[1:40:08] I believe God's children
[1:40:10] we love peace
[1:40:11] right I love peace
[1:40:15] God help us
