[37:33] go to the book of
[37:34] [Music]
[37:37] Romans. How many are grateful that he
[37:39] knows your name? He knows our name. And
[37:41] and that's the the the beauty of the
[37:45] gospel when when we know that we know
[37:48] that he know we know that he knows us.
[37:51] Amen.
[37:53] So book of Romans chapter 9 verse 21.
[38:02] Amen. If you if you have your Bibles and
[38:04] if you if you if you have it, you can
[38:05] say amen. If not, I think it's here on
[38:07] the screen. But it says, "Had not the
[38:10] potter uh the p power over the clay of
[38:15] the same lump to make one vessel of unto
[38:18] honor and another unto dishonor." What
[38:21] if God willing to
[38:26] show his wrath and to make his power
[38:29] known and there with much long suffering
[38:32] the vessels of wrath uh fitted to
[38:35] destruction and that he might make known
[38:37] the riches of his glory on the vessels
[38:40] of mercy which he had afford prepared
[38:43] unto glory even us whom he had called
[38:47] not of the Jews only but also of the
[38:50] Gentiles It's a question.
[38:52] As he had said also in Oayas, I will
[38:55] call them my people which were not my
[38:58] people and her beloved which was not and
[39:02] I will call I will call I will call her
[39:05] beloved which was not beloved. And it
[39:08] shall come to pass that in the place
[39:10] where it was said unto them, Ye are not
[39:12] my people. There there shall they be
[39:16] called the children of the living God. I
[39:19] think we can close our Bibles and we can
[39:20] we can leave this morning. Amen. Is also
[39:24] crith concerning Israel uh though the
[39:27] number of the children of Israel be as
[39:29] the sand of the sea as a remnant shall
[39:31] be saved for he will finish the work and
[39:35] cut it short in righteousness because a
[39:38] short work will the Lord make upon the
[39:40] earth. Amen. You can you may have your
[39:42] seats and then if we go to the book of
[39:44] Psalms chapter 20
[39:50] 23:5 the book of Psalms 23 verse 5 and
[39:54] it says thou preparest a table before me
[39:58] in the presence of my enemies. Thou
[40:00] anointest my head with oil and my cup
[40:04] runth
[40:05] over. Amen. So, uh, as I was saying,
[40:08] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[40:10] and we may read another scripture here,
[40:12] but like, let's let's kind of do the
[40:14] introduction here. So, um, you know,
[40:17] your pastor text me and, uh, it's like,
[40:19] would you like to come and speak for us?
[40:21] And I was like, yeah. I didn't hesitate
[40:23] to say yes or not. You say, yeah, I'll
[40:24] be there. So, um, it's always good to be
[40:27] here. And, uh, good, you know, old
[40:29] friends. I was seeing uh Zach. I
[40:33] remember when I started coming here, it
[40:34] was so almost 13 years ago. So I saw him
[40:38] today. He's like, "How old are you?" I
[40:39] was like, "He's like 16." I was like,
[40:41] "Whoa." When I met him, he was just
[40:43] three years old. That little guy that
[40:45] was always with Sister Pat and brother
[40:46] James, always following them everywhere
[40:48] they went. And I remember coming to
[40:50] visit and I will always stay at the
[40:52] Browning's house and and he was there
[40:55] with grandpa and grandma always. Amen.
[40:57] So, but it's good to be here and and and
[40:59] it seems that you know the more we uh
[41:02] we're getting old. Amen. But we're
[41:06] closer and closer to uh to our
[41:08] theophony. Amen. And uh it's it's just
[41:11] to be good in in the fellowship uh you
[41:14] know with the believers. Amen. Is uh
[41:17] it's always a privilege. And uh this
[41:19] morning uh by God's grace um I would
[41:22] like to uh speak a little uh something
[41:24] that I spoke that at our church there
[41:26] and uh uh but I I was praying and I was
[41:30] asking the Lord Lord wh which direction
[41:33] you want me to go or like uh
[41:35] what do you want me to tell your
[41:38] children and
[41:40] um I I think the Lord just like say stay
[41:43] on that channel. So I I'll stay there
[41:45] and uh we'll see what the Lord has for
[41:47] us this morning. Amen. So this morning
[41:50] uh if if we can give a title to
[41:52] something that we will speak this
[41:53] morning, I will call it a seat at the
[41:56] king's table. So we'll we'll call this a
[41:59] seat at the king's table. Amen. So we
[42:02] just read in the scripture in the in in
[42:04] the book of Psalms 23, thou preparest a
[42:06] a a table in the presence of my enemies.
[42:10] Amen. So that's David. David is speaking
[42:13] about, you know, you prepare a table.
[42:15] Psalms 23, the Lord is my shepherd and
[42:17] and all of that. You you read that
[42:19] psalm, but now it is going here. I I
[42:21] would like to go here a little bit more
[42:24] and then we're we're let's see what the
[42:26] Lord has for us. Now, let's if we can
[42:28] read another scripture here in the book
[42:29] of Zechariah chapter 4 verse 8 uh in and
[42:33] uh verse 8 through verse 10. Um again
[42:37] you know when you read the scriptures it
[42:39] is always uh talking about I I I will
[42:41] finish a work uh I will have to shorten
[42:44] the work because if I wouldn't shorten
[42:47] the work then a lot of people will
[42:49] perish. Amen. Or the love of many will
[42:51] will watch would get will get cold.
[42:55] Amen. But we're grateful that the God
[42:57] that is rich in mercy he's still dealing
[43:00] with us and I'm grateful for that this
[43:03] morning. Like even this morning, I I was
[43:04] a little bit trouble in my heart about
[43:06] certain things, but I I know and and I
[43:09] was there back in the office. I was
[43:11] like, "Lord, I'm grateful because you
[43:13] are still dealing with my heart. I'm
[43:15] grateful because you're still coming and
[43:18] speaking. You're still coming and and
[43:19] and and and bringing that conviction to
[43:22] my heart. Amen. That I know that you are
[43:25] going to finish the work, Lord. I know
[43:28] that if you began the good work as a
[43:30] scripture, that's one of my favorite
[43:32] scriptures. Philippians 1:6 if if if um
[43:35] the the the that I am
[43:38] confident. How many are confident this
[43:40] morning? It said the scripture says that
[43:42] I'm confident of this very thing that he
[43:45] who began the good work will be able to
[43:48] complete it until the day of the Lord.
[43:51] So he's faithful to complete the work
[43:53] that he had started in our lives. So I
[43:56] was I was thanking the Lord this
[43:57] morning. And I was like, Lord, I'm so
[43:59] grateful because I can be in that
[44:01] channel that even though sometimes the
[44:03] enemy comes like like a like a flood,
[44:05] it's coming to attacking your family,
[44:08] your your uh thought life, your your
[44:11] finances, whatever the attack of the
[44:13] enemy may come, but you have a
[44:15] confidence. You you you have you have an
[44:18] anchor. You have something where you can
[44:20] get a hold of, you can grasp and you can
[44:22] say that's my Lord. That's my God. that
[44:25] no matter and as brother Ben uh brother
[44:28] Paul choose that very good song like no
[44:31] matter what tomorrow will bring but I
[44:33] know one thing that he knows my name
[44:36] and we're going to speak a little bit
[44:38] about it this morning. Amen. So I'm
[44:40] grateful for that brother uh Paul. Thank
[44:42] you so much. So the book of Zechariah
[44:44] chapter 4 uh verse 8 to verse 8 and it
[44:48] says moreover the word of the Lord came
[44:49] unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel
[44:52] have laid the foundation of this house
[44:55] his hands shall also finish it and thou
[44:58] shalt know that the Lord of hosts has
[45:00] sent me unto you. And then it says verse
[45:03] 10 for who had despised the day of small
[45:07] things. Right? Amen.
[45:10] So just don't forget that word small
[45:12] things. Amen. For they shall rejoice and
[45:16] shall see the plumth of in the hand of
[45:18] Zerubbabel with those seven. They are
[45:20] this the eyes of the Lord which drawn to
[45:22] and fro uh through the the whole earth.
[45:25] The whole earth. Amen. So who had
[45:28] despised the day of the small things?
[45:30] And uh now uh if we go here uh in in um
[45:35] in u in in in in the in the Old
[45:38] Testament there is one um one character
[45:42] that you know we don't hear a lot about
[45:44] him but maybe this morning we're going
[45:45] to take a we're going to let's think
[45:47] about him. You know we see in the Old
[45:49] Testament uh at the beginning Israel was
[45:51] without a king. We remember that they
[45:53] always were led by first by Moses and
[45:56] then it became the priest and then after
[45:58] that then they they wanted a king. Amen.
[46:01] They wanted to be like the rest of the
[46:03] other nations. So there was a transition
[46:05] in the old testament uh that they they
[46:08] were they were ruled by the judges and
[46:09] then the prophets and now Samuel is
[46:12] doing the transition from the last
[46:13] prophet to what the people wanted. And
[46:16] what did the people wanted? They wanted
[46:17] a king. Amen. Amen. And the people ch
[46:21] and the people they choose Saul from the
[46:23] tribe of Benjamin. And then when you
[46:25] think about the tribe of Benjamin and
[46:28] and you study the tribe of Benjamin, it
[46:30] it is also called the tribe of the
[46:33] little things. The tribe of the small
[46:36] things.
[46:38] And that's what he's saying. Don't
[46:39] despise the day of the small things.
[46:43] Okay? Just just just we're building and
[46:45] we're we're going to get to something.
[46:47] But if you're taking notes, just say
[46:48] small things.
[46:50] Amen. The little things, the small
[46:53] things, you know. Uh uh Saul was the
[46:55] people's election. How many know that
[46:57] Paul I mean Saul was like he didn't even
[47:00] wanted to be the king. But the people
[47:02] they wanted to be like like the rest of
[47:05] the other nations. Amen. But uh it was
[47:08] the people's choice. Amen. If that was
[47:12] democracy because that was what the
[47:13] people wanted. But it wasn't God's
[47:16] election. is is not what God wanted for
[47:18] the people. It's not what God wanted for
[47:20] them to have as a king. Amen. So God had
[47:23] another man coming. But there is
[47:26] something here that that we we we can
[47:28] learn from this morning. How many times
[47:30] if you think about it, we make our
[47:32] choices without waiting or trusting in
[47:35] what the Lord wants for us.
[47:38] Because that's that's what the people of
[47:40] the children of Israel what they were
[47:42] thinking. You know, if we are like the
[47:44] other nations, then we're going to be
[47:46] we're going to be fine.
[47:50] Amen. When you you com when we compare
[47:52] ourselves with the rest of the world,
[47:54] then we get in a lot of trouble. How
[47:56] many how many can say that? Amen to
[47:58] that. You know, when when when the
[48:00] sister in in or like the family in the
[48:02] church, they have a nicer car, then you
[48:05] are like, well, I I need to get a nicer
[48:07] than what they have. Oh, then then they
[48:10] build a house. Then I need to build a
[48:12] beer house.
[48:16] I'm just saying it, but I I know it is
[48:17] not happening here. Amen. You start
[48:20] comparing yourself to what what other
[48:22] people have. Amen. A and and uh there is
[48:26] one I think was a former president of
[48:28] the United States. He said always
[48:30] something. He's like the the thief of
[48:32] joy. Wow. Is comparison.
[48:36] That's good. So, and not only what is
[48:39] outside or the outer things, but when
[48:41] you start comparing your spiritual walk
[48:44] or your spiritual walk with the Lord
[48:47] with others. Oh, because that brother is
[48:49] is is so loud in church, I have to do
[48:51] the same.
[48:53] No,
[48:54] there's God is a God of variety that he
[48:57] he however he wants to move in your
[49:01] heart, just give praise to him. Don't
[49:04] put God in a box that if you don't
[49:07] shout, if you don't jump or if you don't
[49:09] cry, if you don't raise up your hands,
[49:11] then God is not dealing with your heart.
[49:14] Because that's what the prophet of God
[49:16] says that God had a v variety of
[49:18] flowers. He has black, brown, yellow,
[49:21] white. He has all those. And what is
[49:23] that for? So because God wanted to have
[49:25] the flowers like that and that is the
[49:28] same thing with your walk with the Lord.
[49:30] If he wants you to shout, you shout.
[49:33] Right. But the the one that is shouting
[49:36] shouldn't be
[49:37] criticizing the one that is not
[49:39] shouting. That's right.
[49:42] Because what God sees is, you know, when
[49:45] be when uh Samuel was looking for the
[49:48] for the next king, I'm I'm going ahead
[49:50] here a little bit of the notes. Well,
[49:52] but when Samuel was looking for for the
[49:54] next king, he still have the same
[49:56] mentality. I had to choose someone like
[49:58] Saul.
[50:00] But what happened when he when he got to
[50:02] Jesse's house, then he started seeing
[50:04] all of those men and he was like, "Oh,
[50:06] this is the next one. This is the next
[50:08] one." He was comparing to Saul, always
[50:10] comparing to Saul, always referring back
[50:12] to his to what he could see. But then
[50:14] the Lord was like, "No, none of them is
[50:16] is the chosen one." And then and then he
[50:18] asked Jesse like, "Do you have any other
[50:20] one?" And and Jesse was like, "Yeah, the
[50:21] one that is tending to the sheep." He's
[50:23] like, "Okay, bring him here." Right? And
[50:25] then when he brings David and then David
[50:27] and then God, the spirit of God tells
[50:29] Samuel, "That's the one." All right.
[50:32] What happened? Because now God was
[50:34] telling Samuel, "It's not what you see,
[50:37] but is what I see." So that's the
[50:40] confidence that we can have this
[50:42] morning, Lord, in my walk with you is
[50:45] perhaps sometimes like I am so quiet or
[50:48] I'm so loud, Lord, but you look at my
[50:50] heart. Look at the desires and the
[50:52] intents of my heart and may they be
[50:55] according to your word and I'm going to
[50:57] be on a safer spot.
[51:00] Amen. Good preacher. So don't compare
[51:02] yourself. Young people, don't compare
[51:04] yourself. Oh, because that one is a
[51:05] little bit bigger. It's a little more
[51:07] muscles there. Now I have to have to
[51:09] take the extra mile. I'm have to train
[51:11] harder because I want to be like my
[51:13] brother. Don't compare yourself. I'm
[51:15] telling you from experience.
[51:24] Brother Brandham says he's like it's
[51:26] it's time of matching. It's matching
[51:28] time is uh that that we have to compare
[51:31] to something and he said but the the one
[51:33] thing that you have to to compare to is
[51:35] the word of God. Amen. Amen.
[51:39] So you know Saul was
[51:42] chosen. I don't know how much time we
[51:45] have but we're going to be mindful of
[51:46] the time. Amen. So Saul was chosen and
[51:49] uh you know he was the first one that uh
[51:52] he established the kingdom of Israel and
[51:55] it went great. Everything went great
[51:58] under on their soul because despite of
[52:01] him being the cho the the choice of the
[52:03] people he was still anointed by God.
[52:07] Don't forget that. No because he felt no
[52:08] no he was still anointed by God. Yeah.
[52:11] Amen.
[52:13] So everything went well until he
[52:17] disobeyed
[52:19] God's
[52:20] prophet. But why? Because of his own
[52:24] pride.
[52:25] And as the Bible says, you know, pride
[52:28] goes before the what? The fall. So if
[52:32] you read it there in the book of 1st
[52:33] Samuel chapter 15:12 and and verse 13
[52:36] and and you know he's coming he there
[52:39] was amalachites and and then uh he was
[52:42] told destroy destroy everything. You
[52:45] have to destroy everything and and and I
[52:47] want you to notice a type and this is
[52:49] something that I was when I was studying
[52:50] this I was like whoa just notice
[52:53] something. We're talking about the tribe
[52:55] of Benjamin. Saul comes excuse me Saul
[52:57] comes from the tribe of Benjamin. Amen.
[53:00] Then the Amalachites is a tribe or is a
[53:02] group of people that were kind of the
[53:05] enemies of Israel. And then verse 15 uh
[53:08] verse 12 and 13 here in 1 Samuel it says
[53:12] and when Samuel arose early to meet Saul
[53:14] in the morning he was told Saul came to
[53:17] Carmel and behold he set up for himself.
[53:20] There you go. He set up for himself for
[53:24] his own pride. He set up for himself a
[53:26] monument for trophy of his victory.
[53:30] and passed on and went down to Jugo. So
[53:32] in other words, Saul was in a position
[53:35] now everybody see that I was able to
[53:38] kill the Amalachites
[53:41] and he was proudful about it, right? But
[53:44] you know as the Bible talks to us and is
[53:48] in in in another passage in the
[53:50] scriptures when he speaks about
[53:51] Jehoshaphat and and and the prophet
[53:53] comes to him and say you know the battle
[53:55] is not yours the battle is the Lord's.
[53:58] Right? So here Saul was not like you
[54:00] know what I am the one that is that that
[54:02] that is killing the Amalachites. I am
[54:05] the one that is establishing the
[54:07] kingdom. So he was proudful. Right.
[54:10] Right. So he built a monument. So and
[54:13] when you think about a monument or a
[54:15] memorial is a big thing so that whenever
[54:18] people is passing by they can see right
[54:20] right who who who is receiving you know
[54:24] the honors or or or somehow the glory
[54:27] about it so built it in a way like that
[54:30] whenever everybody come or will see that
[54:32] monument they will see that I am the one
[54:36] that instead of giving God's glory he
[54:39] was trying to take God's glory Yeah. So
[54:43] because of his
[54:45] pride came the fall.
[54:49] And Samuel came And Samuel came to Saul
[54:51] and Saul said to him, "Blessed are you
[54:53] of the Lord. I have performed what the
[54:56] Lord have ordered."
[54:59] Are have you
[55:02] question Saul? There was a question.
[55:04] There was an instruction for you. There
[55:06] was something that you specifically
[55:08] needed to do and you didn't do it
[55:11] because of your pride.
[55:14] But I want you to think about something.
[55:15] Remember Saul was coming from the tribe
[55:18] of
[55:19] Benjamin and then there were the
[55:21] Malachites. And think about one thing,
[55:24] you know, because what Saul didn't do,
[55:29] there was someone in the scriptures that
[55:31] later on she did
[55:34] it. And who was this? This was
[55:37] Esther. Why am I bringing Esther? When I
[55:40] was studying about this and I was
[55:42] looking at Esther's life, guess which
[55:45] tribe was Esther coming from? Esther was
[55:48] coming from the tribe of Benjamin.
[55:51] Right? So when when the people of Israel
[55:54] were in in you know in in in trouble
[55:57] when Esther was there uh and she was
[56:00] told if you don't even if you don't do
[56:01] something there that the salvation will
[56:03] come somehow for the Jews. That was a
[56:05] promise from God. They had like uh like
[56:08] time- tested memorials that they can say
[56:10] you know what if you don't intercede for
[56:12] us somebody will come and save us anyway
[56:14] because we are the royal seat of God.
[56:17] But and let me tell you who the the guy
[56:20] that was a kind of that had that anger
[56:23] against the Israelites it it was uh Hmon
[56:27] right and guess who who's Hmon's uh
[56:31] tribe we he was coming from he was an
[56:34] Amalachite
[56:37] so you see what Saul couldn't
[56:39] do there was a descendant of Saul
[56:44] but I that she was able to fulfill God's
[56:48] word to come and expose her enemy in
[56:51] front of whom of whom? In front of the
[56:54] king. In other words, I can tell you if
[56:57] your lineage is not the the most perfect
[57:01] because you may come from the drunkards
[57:03] or drug addicts or porn addicts or
[57:07] whatever, that doesn't have nothing to
[57:10] do what with what God's seed has for
[57:12] you. Amen. Amen. Because when the the
[57:15] the new birth come to a people to a
[57:18] person the brother Brandham says that
[57:20] the new birth pretty much erases all
[57:22] your past. The new birth come and
[57:25] changes what's going to be your future.
[57:28] Amen. So when we can see a soul that was
[57:31] a disobedience now we can see an Esther
[57:34] that she didn't do what her form like
[57:36] her great great great grandpa did but
[57:38] she did something something different.
[57:40] and she exposed her enemy and she was
[57:42] able to kill her enemy.
[57:45] So what can you do this morning knowing
[57:48] Lord I I am part of those little things
[57:50] but help me to make the right decisions.
[57:54] Amen.
[57:56] Now let's go back here. So he was sold
[57:58] to
[57:59] kill Saul was told to kill the
[58:01] Amalachites and and like he was not
[58:03] supposed to bring any of the spo from
[58:05] the battle but he did that. Right? He
[58:09] was thinking that the Lord was needing
[58:11] those sacrifices he was bringing. You
[58:14] know, that's what when the Lord gives an
[58:16] instruction, if you go and read the
[58:18] scriptures, when he gives you an
[58:19] instruction, if he doesn't say
[58:21] something, don't do it. Right? You know,
[58:24] when he was when Noah was building the
[58:26] ark and he was given specific
[58:29] instructions on how to build the ark, he
[58:33] didn't have to come with anything, but
[58:35] he had all the instructions already
[58:36] given. And that's the same thing for us.
[58:38] That's why you don't you don't you're
[58:40] not supposed to add or you're not
[58:42] supposed to remove from the scriptures
[58:44] because the scriptures are perfect.
[58:47] That's why if the Lord tells you to do
[58:49] something, just do it.
[58:53] So, so was like Samuel. Oh, and it
[58:56] sounded very good. You know, if you
[58:57] think about it, oh, you know, he's
[58:59] bringing a lot of tiding to the church.
[59:01] Praise the Lord for that. He is bringing
[59:03] a lot of offerings to offer to our God
[59:06] Jehovah. But what was the instruction?
[59:10] You go there, kill and destroy.
[59:13] So that's why when God tells you you
[59:15] have to kill and destroy. The prophet of
[59:17] God says who is your worst enemy? You
[59:19] are your worst enemy. And he also said
[59:22] destroy your enemy before your enemy
[59:26] destroys you. So that's a clear
[59:29] instruction from the prophet of God and
[59:30] from the scriptures. What should we do?
[59:32] Go back and destroy your enemy. Right?
[59:34] But Saul, he was not he was not kind of
[59:37] he he he he had an idea. He had an
[59:39] agenda. He had he had he said he may
[59:42] have thought you know what if I'm
[59:43] bringing this sacrifice the people is
[59:45] going to be pleased. The people is going
[59:46] to see oh you know how great thou are
[59:48] Saul.
[59:51] But God doesn't want to share his glory
[59:53] with anyone.
[59:55] Amen.
[59:57] Now 1st Samuel chap chap 15 22 and 26 it
[1:00:02] through 26 and it says Samuel said has
[1:00:05] the Lord as a a great a delight in burnt
[1:00:08] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[1:00:11] the voice of the Lord. Behold to obey is
[1:00:15] better than sacrifice and to hearken
[1:00:18] than the fat of rams. for
[1:00:21] rebellion. Listen to this.
[1:00:24] When you are a when you have a
[1:00:26] rebellious spirit
[1:00:29] against your parents, against the
[1:00:32] ministry,
[1:00:33] listen what it is. For rebellion is as
[1:00:36] the sin of witchcraft
[1:00:39] and stubbornness is as idolatry and
[1:00:42] theaphim. And what is theaphim? Here it
[1:00:45] is talking about household uh uh of good
[1:00:48] luck images. Amen. because you have
[1:00:51] rejected the word of the Lord. He also
[1:00:54] has rejected you from being the king.
[1:00:57] Right? So now there is a message
[1:01:00] straight from the prophet of God to
[1:01:03] Saul. You were given clear instructions
[1:01:06] you didn't follow. Now these are the
[1:01:08] consequences.
[1:01:10] All right? But let me tell you one thing
[1:01:12] because it seems like oh oh you know
[1:01:14] what I'm all out. I've made so many
[1:01:18] mistakes so I'm out. But let me tell you
[1:01:20] this was before Calvary.
[1:01:22] Right? So that now if you make a mistake
[1:01:27] now I if you disobey the Lord
[1:01:30] somehow there is still grace. There is
[1:01:34] still the the blood of of the lamb that
[1:01:37] is interceding for you that whenever he
[1:01:40] sees the earth what is he seeing now?
[1:01:43] He's seeing the blood. But you have to
[1:01:47] have that's why the the scripture speaks
[1:01:49] about it a contrite heart I will not
[1:01:53] despise. So in other words if you see
[1:01:55] here Saul he was not repentant. He was
[1:01:57] like yeah you know what yeah this is
[1:01:58] what I did give it or take it. Right.
[1:02:02] That's your problem Samuel.
[1:02:05] But in our in our case I I don't want to
[1:02:07] have that attitude. I just want to say
[1:02:09] Lord if I have failed you forgive me. If
[1:02:12] I have done something that is not
[1:02:14] according to what you want, forgive me.
[1:02:17] And he's more than willing to forgive
[1:02:19] you more than you. Not that you when
[1:02:22] more than you when you ask for
[1:02:23] forgiveness, he's like there, I can
[1:02:25] forgive you. Forgiveness, forgiveness,
[1:02:27] forgiveness, just come come and ask for
[1:02:29] forgiveness. But many times we hide.
[1:02:33] But in this case, you know, Saul didn't
[1:02:35] hide. He was like, you know what? This
[1:02:37] is it.
[1:02:39] But now look, verse 24. And Saul said to
[1:02:41] Samuel, "I have sinned." Now he's
[1:02:44] repenting, but too
[1:02:46] late. For I have transgressed the
[1:02:48] commandment of the Lord and your words
[1:02:50] because I fear the people and obey their
[1:02:53] voice. Now I pray you, pardon my sin,
[1:02:56] and go back with me that I may worship
[1:02:58] the Lord." And Saul said to and Samuel
[1:03:02] said to Saul, "I will not return with
[1:03:04] you, for you have rejected the word of
[1:03:08] the Lord." and the Lord has rejected you
[1:03:11] from being king over Israel.
[1:03:16] The price of his disobedience was his
[1:03:18] kingdom.
[1:03:20] It was given to somebody else. And we
[1:03:22] know by the scriptures that it was for
[1:03:24] God's elected man who was coming. Now
[1:03:27] the next in line was
[1:03:29] David. That could be the same for us
[1:03:32] today. You know, many times because our
[1:03:33] pride gets in between God and us, we
[1:03:36] make choices that are good in our eyes,
[1:03:40] but the results are not what he wants
[1:03:43] for us. But it's because, you know, I I
[1:03:46] I am better than
[1:03:49] God. That's what we say
[1:03:52] sometimes. Listen to his voice and you
[1:03:55] will never be ashamed. Amen. I get to
[1:03:58] think of Saul's life. He didn't want to
[1:04:00] be a king. If you if you think even
[1:04:02] before he became a king, he didn't even
[1:04:04] want to be a king. He he was sending to
[1:04:06] his father's uh donkeys, you know, he
[1:04:08] was happy there and he was a very shy
[1:04:10] man. But then when he comes into the
[1:04:12] kingdom now, he starts kind of puffing
[1:04:14] up, you know, and now I'm this great I'm
[1:04:17] I'm this great king of Israel. I'm I'm
[1:04:19] building. I'm I'm I'm doing all these
[1:04:21] great things. And God is like he was
[1:04:23] just looking at him and he was still
[1:04:25] accepted, you know, before the Lord. But
[1:04:27] when he disobeyed, then God was like,
[1:04:29] "Yeah, that's it. you are rejected.
[1:04:31] That's right. Because I have a purpose
[1:04:33] for somebody else. Amen. So now I if uh
[1:04:36] if you if you if you read you keep
[1:04:38] reading in the scriptures then there
[1:04:40] comes the time when uh there is a
[1:04:42] prophecy given for the the days of of
[1:04:44] Saul and in his kingdom how everything
[1:04:47] was going to end. And if you read in the
[1:04:49] scriptures what's going to happen is
[1:04:51] they go to battle and then Saul is
[1:04:53] suffering there and then he's not able
[1:04:55] to die yet. So he asked his arm bearer,
[1:04:58] he's like, "Hey, you you know what? Just
[1:04:59] kill me." But the the the guy the the
[1:05:02] his bearer, he's like, "No, I'm not. How
[1:05:04] can I am I going to kill the anointed of
[1:05:06] God?" You know what Saul ended up doing?
[1:05:09] He killed himself.
[1:05:11] You know, one bad choice will bring you
[1:05:14] to another bad bad choice and another
[1:05:16] bad choice and another bad choice.
[1:05:18] Right.
[1:05:20] How many souls still we have in our
[1:05:22] lives that brings brings our pride,
[1:05:25] brings our you know like I'm I'm better
[1:05:27] than thou a lot of big eyes and little
[1:05:30] use. That was Saul. But God didn't lift
[1:05:34] didn't leave it there. Amen. So now
[1:05:38] where we want to focus this morning when
[1:05:39] we're invited at the a seat at the
[1:05:42] king's table, let's think a little bit
[1:05:44] about uh
[1:05:46] Mephibos. If you have heard his name or
[1:05:49] not, but let's let's think a little bit
[1:05:50] about him. Uh
[1:05:56] now David, now let's let's fast forward
[1:05:59] this to David becoming the king. So now
[1:06:01] David is the king. Now he's the the man
[1:06:04] after God's own heart. And now he's
[1:06:07] like, "Now I'm the king. Now I I can
[1:06:10] rule over Israel and everything." But
[1:06:12] then u there comes a cry. There comes a
[1:06:16] question. 2 Samuel chapter 4 uh verse
[1:06:19] four is and Jonathan Saul's son had had
[1:06:22] a son that was lame of his feet. He was
[1:06:26] five years old when he when the tidings
[1:06:28] came of Saul and Jonathan's uh in and
[1:06:30] Jonathan out of Jezrael. and his nurse,
[1:06:33] you know, the the nurse was taking care
[1:06:35] of of this meibos and then she kind of
[1:06:38] everybody was in a rush. So she took him
[1:06:41] and they fled and it came to pass and
[1:06:43] she she was kind of in a rush that he
[1:06:46] fell and he became lame
[1:06:50] and his name was Mephiboset. And if if
[1:06:52] you study this the the meanings in the
[1:06:55] names on in the scripture meos it is an
[1:06:59] an exterminator of shame.
[1:07:02] So that's meshed. He he is an
[1:07:04] exterminator of shame. So what does the
[1:07:08] Bible why does the Bible if you think
[1:07:10] about the scriptures why do the
[1:07:11] scriptures are so detailed that now it
[1:07:14] comes to say this guy was lame.
[1:07:18] He's talking about his condition. But if
[1:07:21] if you think about it he wasn't born
[1:07:24] that way. Meibos wasn't born that way.
[1:07:29] It was an accident that he ended up
[1:07:31] crippled. How many Mibos can be here
[1:07:34] today full of pain, full of anger, full
[1:07:39] of depression, full of anxiety, mistakes
[1:07:43] that you didn't want to do, yet you
[1:07:45] still
[1:07:46] did. You're carrying your past. You're
[1:07:50] carrying your upbringing. As I was
[1:07:51] saying earlier,
[1:07:53] this but you you were not born that way.
[1:07:59] Amen. And we can say that when somebody
[1:08:02] somebody is spiritually lame, it's like
[1:08:04] it's like a mute person as well because
[1:08:06] they can they they can see and they can
[1:08:09] hear the truth. They can even confess it
[1:08:12] but they are paralyzed from acting on
[1:08:15] the word of God
[1:08:18] because Mephibushed was paralyzed. He
[1:08:20] couldn't walk. Right? How many times in
[1:08:23] your life you you want to go forward
[1:08:25] with Christ, but you can't. Why you
[1:08:28] can't? Because you're carrying your
[1:08:30] past.
[1:08:32] You're carrying your complexes. You're
[1:08:35] you're carrying everything that the Lord
[1:08:37] is like, you know what? Why don't you
[1:08:39] come and confess it to me? Why don't you
[1:08:41] come and leave that yoke there and I
[1:08:44] will give you a lighter yoke because it
[1:08:47] said the Bible says that my yoke is
[1:08:49] light and it is an easy one. Yes. But we
[1:08:53] are still like
[1:08:56] still carrying that still carrying our
[1:08:59] past still carrying those pains you know
[1:09:02] that happened years ago or yesterday or
[1:09:04] whenever but now he's giving us that God
[1:09:08] is giving us that option to say you know
[1:09:09] what you don't have to carry that pain
[1:09:12] anymore you don't have to live depressed
[1:09:14] all for the rest of your days you don't
[1:09:16] have to live anxious for the rest of
[1:09:18] your days
[1:09:20] there is a way of escape
[1:09:25] Amen.
[1:09:27] The only thing I can think of is our
[1:09:29] issues didn't come at birth. But as we
[1:09:32] interacted, listen to this. As we
[1:09:35] interacted with people, with our
[1:09:37] parents, with our with our with our
[1:09:39] siblings, with our friends, with
[1:09:43] family, that hurt us. when you had an
[1:09:46] abusive parent that was like a military
[1:09:49] at home and that those those traits
[1:09:52] you're still bringing them into your
[1:09:54] marriage. You're still can kind of
[1:09:56] carrying all those things to your
[1:09:58] children.
[1:10:00] But God can set you free from that.
[1:10:04] He can do that.
[1:10:06] Why am I always depressed?
[1:10:09] Why am I always anxious? You know, we
[1:10:12] always think about depression. What is
[1:10:13] depression? Oh, you know, you get just
[1:10:15] get the Holy Spirit and and that's going
[1:10:17] to be fixed. Well, many people have
[1:10:19] gotten the Holy Spirit and still leaving
[1:10:21] the press.
[1:10:24] Why is that? Because you have to get to
[1:10:26] the core issue. That's right. That's
[1:10:29] good. You know, when brother Brandon
[1:10:31] will always talk to the people and you
[1:10:32] know that there's one is one one
[1:10:35] specific case is called about sister
[1:10:37] little young uh young sister Margaret
[1:10:39] when he goes and talk to her and he's
[1:10:41] like, you know what, she was all gone.
[1:10:44] She like she was in the insane
[1:10:46] institution and she was gone.
[1:10:49] But brother Brandham, he's like I was
[1:10:51] trying to get to her spirit and I was
[1:10:53] trying to to you know do you know who I
[1:10:55] am? And you know she was not responding
[1:10:57] and then at some point you know when the
[1:10:59] spirit of God came and he was like oh
[1:11:00] you know what you wanted to be the a
[1:11:03] wife a preacher's wife right? Right. And
[1:11:06] then he's like, and at that moment that
[1:11:09] sister, that young sister completely
[1:11:12] changed her countenance. Why? Because
[1:11:14] she was able to get That's right. to the
[1:11:17] root cause, to the core issue that she
[1:11:19] was dealing with. And then in the next
[1:11:22] minute, she was set free from that. All
[1:11:24] right.
[1:11:26] Don't you believe that if you are
[1:11:28] dealing with something today that if you
[1:11:31] pray to God that he can show you the the
[1:11:34] the moment or the hour or when a
[1:11:37] specific situation happened in your life
[1:11:40] and and he can show you and set you free
[1:11:42] from that. That's right. I believe that
[1:11:46] the Lord had done it with me many times.
[1:11:48] I sometimes you know you're angry and I
[1:11:50] I was like I I I I am at home and my
[1:11:53] wife you know she's a sweetheart she
[1:11:56] knows how to deal with me. Amen.
[1:11:59] So you know some she now knows me very
[1:12:02] well and like she's like I know what
[1:12:03] happened at at work right and I was like
[1:12:05] yes so she knows
[1:12:08] but if you think about it once you know
[1:12:12] where the enemy can attack you then
[1:12:15] you're able to respond now you're able
[1:12:17] to to uh to uh to to build a plan to
[1:12:21] respond back. You know when you're going
[1:12:22] to war you know somebody that is going
[1:12:24] to war they are not just going to just
[1:12:26] going to go and try to fight. No, they
[1:12:27] have to devise a plan. They have to
[1:12:30] develop a plan so then that how they're
[1:12:32] going to respond against the enemy. And
[1:12:34] that's the same thing we have to do when
[1:12:36] you know that you're dealing with
[1:12:38] anxiety that you know that you're
[1:12:39] dealing with depression. You can ask
[1:12:41] Lord, Lord, why am I feeling this way?
[1:12:44] And the Lord can show you. Yes, he can.
[1:12:46] He saw it in my life. So that that the
[1:12:48] next time I if he shows me where that
[1:12:51] thing is coming from, then I just bring
[1:12:53] it back to the Lord and say, "Lord, I
[1:12:55] don't want to take this anymore."
[1:12:58] So then the next time when when the
[1:13:00] enemy tried to come with the same
[1:13:02] triggers against me, then I know how to
[1:13:04] respond. That's right. Then I'm not
[1:13:06] going to be all grunchy getting home and
[1:13:08] my wife is like, "Oh, I'm not going to
[1:13:09] talk to him because if I talk to him,
[1:13:11] then he's going to be kind of aggressive
[1:13:12] or something." No, not that I am
[1:13:14] aggressive,
[1:13:15] mostly. But just just thinking about it
[1:13:18] when you know you know the enemy has
[1:13:21] been studying you for the past 6,000
[1:13:23] years.
[1:13:25] Why wouldn't we able to respond back
[1:13:27] with the word of God and just asking the
[1:13:30] Lord, Lord, now I know that I got the
[1:13:32] Holy Spirit. I know that I am still in
[1:13:34] my soul, but what about my spirit?
[1:13:38] What about my emotions? What about about
[1:13:41] those five senses in my life? They they
[1:13:44] need repair many times. They need fixing
[1:13:47] all the time. Yes, that's good
[1:13:49] preaching. Amen. So if you feel
[1:13:52] depressed, ask Lord, Lord, why am I
[1:13:54] feeling depressed? Or if you feel
[1:13:55] anxious, what is depression? Is thinking
[1:13:57] about the things of the past, right? And
[1:14:00] that's why you're like, oh, I did this,
[1:14:01] I did that. It is already in the past.
[1:14:06] Yes, sir. Amen. And then what about when
[1:14:08] you're feeling anxious?
[1:14:11] I think I was reading a statistics.
[1:14:13] 98% of our anxiety or the things that we
[1:14:17] think they're going to happen, they most
[1:14:19] likely will never happen.
[1:14:23] So
[1:14:24] somehow you rob or you steal from your
[1:14:27] day,
[1:14:29] a day with Christ because you're
[1:14:31] thinking ahead
[1:14:34] too much. It's not it's not a bad thing
[1:14:36] to plan or it's not a bad thing to to do
[1:14:38] those things. But when you are kind of
[1:14:40] just so focused on those things, then
[1:14:42] you're you become anxious and then you
[1:14:45] start responding to that anxiety in the
[1:14:48] wrong way. Going to the wrong websites,
[1:14:50] going to to drink or drugs or whatever.
[1:14:55] It's more how you're responding against
[1:14:58] the attacks of the enemy
[1:15:00] because the prophet of God said and and
[1:15:02] it's good to say what the prophet of God
[1:15:04] said. He said that the enemy has a right
[1:15:08] to one final punch.
[1:15:11] He said that and then he said and as he
[1:15:14] has a right what do you have to do? You
[1:15:17] have to be prayed for. In other words,
[1:15:19] if I'm deal I I'm going to be honest. If
[1:15:22] I deal with a complex of rejection, what
[1:15:24] do I have to do? I have to be pray and
[1:15:26] say, Lord, the brother or sister didn't
[1:15:28] mean it that way. I bring it back to
[1:15:30] you. That's right. But you have to pray
[1:15:32] about it. And you have to have a shield
[1:15:35] or you have to have you have to have a
[1:15:37] mechanism of defense against what the
[1:15:39] enemy can come against you. Yes, sir.
[1:15:42] But if you think here and that's where
[1:15:45] talking about meos, he he was not born
[1:15:49] that way. That's right. He was not born
[1:15:52] a man.
[1:15:54] Boas was not born a defeated person. You
[1:15:57] were not born a a an anxious person, a
[1:16:00] depressed person.
[1:16:02] But it's the things in life. That's
[1:16:05] right. Relationships, interaction with
[1:16:08] people that somehow had brought all
[1:16:10] those things to our lives that we now
[1:16:13] have to carry. Right? But there is a
[1:16:17] chance that you don't have to carry
[1:16:18] those things anymore.
[1:16:20] How? Because you confess him. You bring
[1:16:23] him to Christ and you say, "Lord, I
[1:16:25] don't want to carry any of these
[1:16:26] things."
[1:16:29] Amen. But now we know that God, he has
[1:16:33] come to heal all these
[1:16:36] things. You know, now let's read in the
[1:16:39] book of sec 2 Samuel chapter uh ver uh
[1:16:42] chapter 9:9. And David said, "Is there
[1:16:45] still anyone left of the house of Saul
[1:16:48] to whom I may show kindness for
[1:16:49] Jonathan's sake?" Now look, the king
[1:16:53] wanted to show kindness towards the
[1:16:55] family of Jonathan. The price was paid
[1:16:58] for the love that David had for
[1:17:01] Jonathan. David perhaps was reminded of
[1:17:03] the covenant that he had made with his
[1:17:05] friend. And now we can say this. There
[1:17:09] is an eternal covenant for the many
[1:17:11] lames that can be here today.
[1:17:14] I was lame. But now I'm walking with
[1:17:18] Christ. Amen. And he made a covenant. He
[1:17:20] paid the
[1:17:21] price. We can see this in our day. The
[1:17:24] Lord wanted to show kindness to us. He
[1:17:27] called us and we answered. Have you
[1:17:29] answered this morning? We He called us
[1:17:32] and we answer. And that's why now we can
[1:17:34] be seated in heavenly places in Christ
[1:17:37] Jesus. And the prophet of God says that
[1:17:39] those heavenly places are the position
[1:17:41] of the believer. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:44] Because is this something that you you
[1:17:46] wanted? You wanted to be in church. You
[1:17:49] wanted to be in this fellowship. No, it
[1:17:52] was his election.
[1:17:54] And you cannot go against election. You
[1:17:57] cannot go against predestination.
[1:18:00] And I can tell you election looks beyond
[1:18:03] our faults. Election looks beyond our
[1:18:06] mistakes. It looks beyond our
[1:18:08] shortcomings.
[1:18:10] Why? Because now election is looking at
[1:18:13] the promise.
[1:18:16] Election now is looking at the promise.
[1:18:20] How many believe that this morning?
[1:18:22] Amen. If you're looking at your mistake,
[1:18:24] I can tell you you are wrong. Because
[1:18:26] now you have to look at the promise that
[1:18:28] those that he loved, he justified, he
[1:18:30] redeemed, he glorified, and now he has
[1:18:32] given them the the the honor, the
[1:18:34] position to be called the children of
[1:18:36] God. That's your promise this morning.
[1:18:44] Election looks at the promise. And I can
[1:18:47] tell you, a mistake doesn't define who
[1:18:50] you are.
[1:18:52] A mistake doesn't define your future.
[1:18:54] Right? A mistake doesn't doesn't defy
[1:18:57] what define what you're going to be
[1:18:59] doing tomorrow. No. If you dwell in that
[1:19:01] mistake, yeah, it is going to be
[1:19:03] defining all your choices. All all the
[1:19:05] decisions you had to make. But but when
[1:19:07] you're trusting in God, that's going to
[1:19:09] change the picture because now you say,
[1:19:11] "Lord, I made a mistake. I bring it
[1:19:13] under the blood, but now help me. Now I
[1:19:15] want to go forward with you." That's a
[1:19:17] different outcome.
[1:19:19] Thank you, Lord. Yes, sir. If you have
[1:19:22] confessed it and you have brought it
[1:19:23] under the blood, what your mistake?
[1:19:25] There is nothing that can be against
[1:19:27] you. You know that's when the accuser of
[1:19:30] the brethren comes against you. When he
[1:19:32] comes and brings your mistake before
[1:19:34] God, what what what is the Lord telling
[1:19:36] him? Like I don't see anything. The only
[1:19:38] thing I'm seeing is I'm seeing perfect
[1:19:40] children of God.
[1:19:43] Why? Because they I'm just seeing them
[1:19:45] through the blood. I'm not seeing them
[1:19:47] through anything else. I'm not seeing
[1:19:48] them through even the law. Right?
[1:19:51] Because if I will see them through the
[1:19:52] blood, I wouldn't be here. You wouldn't
[1:19:55] be here. But now he's seeing you to the
[1:19:58] perfect through the perfect sacrifice
[1:20:00] that was sh the blood that was shed at
[1:20:02] the cross of Calvary. And now when the
[1:20:05] enemy comes and accuses you, what can
[1:20:07] you say? I don't say anything. I rest.
[1:20:11] How many can rest this morning and say,
[1:20:13] Lord, I can rest this morning knowing
[1:20:16] that you know my past. You know my
[1:20:19] present. You know my future.
[1:20:22] Hallelujah.
[1:20:25] Election is looking at the sacrifice at
[1:20:27] Calvary because that is what what
[1:20:30] defines who I am. That's what had
[1:20:32] defined my destiny. The sacrifice at
[1:20:35] Calvary. The prophet of God says in the
[1:20:37] message adoption number one it says
[1:20:39] elections look election looks back to
[1:20:42] forknowledge and predestination looks to
[1:20:45] your destiny. Right?
[1:20:48] Election looks back. It's like I was I
[1:20:50] was elected before the foundation of the
[1:20:52] world. And predestination is like
[1:20:53] predestination know where you're going
[1:20:55] to be brought to. Amen.
[1:20:59] Amen. You believe that this morning?
[1:21:04] So
[1:21:05] now and of the house of Saul there was a
[1:21:09] servant whose name was
[1:21:10] Ceba. When they had called him to David,
[1:21:13] he said to him, "Are you Ceba?" He
[1:21:15] said,"I your servant am he." The king
[1:21:18] said,"Is there not still someone of the
[1:21:20] house of Saul to whom I may show uh the
[1:21:22] mercy and kindness of God?" And SA
[1:21:25] replied, Jonathan has yet a son of uh
[1:21:27] who is laying his feet. And if you see
[1:21:30] here, somehow Jonathan had given his
[1:21:34] life for his son, right? And if if you
[1:21:37] again look at the meanings in the
[1:21:39] scriptures, Jonathan means the gift of
[1:21:41] God.
[1:21:43] So somehow Jonathan has given his life
[1:21:45] for his son so that when he came in
[1:21:47] front of
[1:21:48] David was David able to kill Jonath I
[1:21:52] mean Miboset he couldn't because
[1:21:55] somebody had paid the price amen
[1:21:59] and uh verse four I think is 2 Samuel
[1:22:03] chapter uh I I I missed that sorry and
[1:22:07] the king said where is where is he? Zeba
[1:22:09] replied, "He's in the house of Makir and
[1:22:12] son of Amiel in Loar." Now think about
[1:22:15] this word Loar. That's a city where
[1:22:19] Mephibos was sent to.
[1:22:24] And this place called
[1:22:26] Loar means a place where there is no
[1:22:30] pasture and a place where is no word.
[1:22:35] Meibos was sent to that place. a a
[1:22:39] desert a desertic like a
[1:22:42] a wilderness place.
[1:22:46] Now think about it. The prince because
[1:22:49] now meosed was a prince. He was living
[1:22:52] in a place where no fruit was being
[1:22:54] produced. No word was being produced
[1:22:58] either. Why? Why was he there? Because
[1:23:00] he was broken. He was depressed. He was
[1:23:04] lonely. He was angry. And also you know
[1:23:07] if you think about loar it was called
[1:23:09] considered a ghetto place in in the in
[1:23:11] the biblical time. So it was not the
[1:23:13] best place for them to live.
[1:23:16] How many times I'll bring it back to
[1:23:19] you. How many times you have you you f
[1:23:22] we found ourselves in lobar
[1:23:26] where we are not able to hear the word
[1:23:28] of God because we are looking at our
[1:23:31] condition because we're sitting in our
[1:23:35] complexes of superiority of inferiority
[1:23:39] of race of color of this that and the
[1:23:43] other. You're you're you're in love.
[1:23:44] You're not producing anything.
[1:23:48] You're living in a victim mentality.
[1:23:53] That's good preaching. But think about
[1:23:55] it. Meet he was part of the royal
[1:23:58] family.
[1:24:01] That's right. If you're part of the
[1:24:03] royal family, how should you leave? How
[1:24:06] should you act? Right.
[1:24:09] But you think if you know at five years
[1:24:11] old like he was not going to be able you
[1:24:13] know to to to be a a royal perhaps and
[1:24:17] and then at five years old maybe he was
[1:24:19] always looked down because of her
[1:24:21] condition or he was always told you're
[1:24:23] not good
[1:24:24] enough. How many how many of you
[1:24:28] fathers, you older fathers, maybe when
[1:24:32] you were growing up, you never had a
[1:24:35] word of affirmation from your earthly
[1:24:38] father. That's so true.
[1:24:40] That you were never good enough. That
[1:24:43] you were never measuring up to to your
[1:24:45] father's standards. That's right. And
[1:24:48] what happened? Now you have your
[1:24:49] children and now you're measuring your
[1:24:51] children the same way.
[1:24:56] But why why am I talking about
[1:24:58] affirmation? If you if you're reading in
[1:24:59] in uh in in the New Testament when Jesus
[1:25:03] is going to be uh baptized by John the
[1:25:07] Baptist, what what what is happening
[1:25:09] there? This is my beloved son
[1:25:13] to whom I am well pleased to dwell. That
[1:25:17] was the first time the father is
[1:25:20] affirming his son.
[1:25:24] Yes sir. So why why are we why are we
[1:25:27] talking about all of these? Because
[1:25:29] there are many parents, many fathers in
[1:25:32] that loar condition that they can bring
[1:25:35] their children, their daughters, their
[1:25:37] their sons, they can bring them in a way
[1:25:40] that what can happen there? Oh, you're
[1:25:43] never good enough.
[1:25:45] Oh, you're not performing the way I used
[1:25:47] to do it or you're not doing it the way
[1:25:49] I used to. I I was better than you.
[1:25:53] And you're bringing your children to
[1:25:55] that love of our condition that your
[1:25:57] children are like, "Well, I'm not good
[1:25:58] enough. Then why would why do I go to
[1:26:00] church?" Or, "Why do I do what you asked
[1:26:02] me to do if I'm never good enough?"
[1:26:06] The father was affirming Jesus the first
[1:26:08] time when he went to when he went to be
[1:26:11] baptized. I am well pleased to dwell in
[1:26:13] my beloved son. But then the next time
[1:26:16] when he's with uh Peter uh John and
[1:26:19] James he's they are in the in the mount
[1:26:23] of
[1:26:23] transfiguration when he they are there
[1:26:26] and mo Moses and Elijah is coming then
[1:26:29] the voice comes and a voice of
[1:26:32] affirmation is coming there and it says
[1:26:35] this is my beloved son in whom I'm d I'm
[1:26:39] well ple I'm I'm well pleased and then
[1:26:42] it changes something else hear ye him
[1:26:48] now from an affirmation of this is my
[1:26:50] son to an affirmation of this is my son
[1:26:54] and now he's receiving all the authority
[1:26:59] of the kingdom
[1:27:02] will it be that some
[1:27:05] parents never heard those affirmations
[1:27:08] from their from their some fathers never
[1:27:10] heard those affirmations from their
[1:27:12] fathers And that's why sometimes the
[1:27:15] decisions you have made they have not
[1:27:17] been made the best decision because
[1:27:19] you're always thinking oh what is my
[1:27:21] father what would have what would my
[1:27:22] father have thought if I would have said
[1:27:24] this or if I would have said that but
[1:27:26] wouldn't you be open this morning to say
[1:27:30] Lord I know my father never affirm me I
[1:27:33] know my father never told me that he's
[1:27:36] proud of me or that he was proud of me
[1:27:38] because of what I was doing but I know
[1:27:40] that you are That's right. Will you this
[1:27:44] morning h
[1:27:46] father affirm who I am in you?
[1:27:51] You can ask him that. You can ask that
[1:27:54] to the father. And the same thing for
[1:27:56] our sisters. Your you are a mother and
[1:27:58] and then your mother never you have that
[1:28:00] connection with your with your mother
[1:28:02] and it was always you know that fight
[1:28:04] that fight fight fight. Why was that?
[1:28:06] Because you know your how your mom was
[1:28:09] raised, he she was carrying a lot. She
[1:28:12] was trying to raise you and then how you
[1:28:14] were raised. Now you're trying to raise
[1:28:16] your daughters or your sons and it has
[1:28:19] been
[1:28:21] hard. But the father is pleased with you
[1:28:23] this morning and he's hearing your pain
[1:28:26] and he knows your pain. He knows your
[1:28:29] name. He knows your need. And the father
[1:28:32] is this morning saying, "I want affirm
[1:28:35] you." Right.
[1:28:37] I want to tell you that you are my son.
[1:28:41] I want to tell you that you are my
[1:28:43] daughter. I want to tell you that
[1:28:46] despite all your mistakes, all the bad
[1:28:48] decisions that you have made,
[1:28:52] I'm still here. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:28:54] Lord. Amen. That's the father. That's
[1:28:57] the real love of the father.
[1:29:01] That is telling us this morning, I'm
[1:29:03] proud of you. Amen. I'm proud of you
[1:29:05] because you wake up this morning. You
[1:29:07] woke up this morning and you were you
[1:29:09] were able to make it to church, right?
[1:29:12] And I know your battles. I know your
[1:29:15] struggles. I know your pain, but you're
[1:29:18] still fighting. You're still standing.
[1:29:21] You're still struggling. But I know that
[1:29:24] your time of deliverance will come
[1:29:26] sometime.
[1:29:29] That's the love of the father. That's
[1:29:31] right. Amen. I don't I don't I don't
[1:29:34] want to leave here this
[1:29:36] morning without telling you this that
[1:29:39] the love of our
[1:29:41] condition is a a is a bare condition. I
[1:29:46] is is a condition where no fruit can be
[1:29:49] produced. But there was something
[1:29:52] happening here with Nephiette. Now he
[1:29:55] was being said, you know what? The king
[1:29:57] is calling your name.
[1:30:00] Aren't you grateful this morning? Now
[1:30:02] the king is calling your name. Now the
[1:30:04] king is asking for, "Hey, where is my
[1:30:07] son Boaz? Where's my son Shane? Where's
[1:30:10] my son Paul? Where is my son Ben? I am
[1:30:13] right here, Lord. I'm full of pain.
[1:30:16] Certainly, Lord, but I am right here
[1:30:18] this morning. You're calling my name.
[1:30:22] You're bringing me out of that love of
[1:30:24] our condition, Lord." Yes. Amen. That's
[1:30:27] what I want. And from my own experience,
[1:30:30] you know, at some point you come to a
[1:30:32] time that you cannot meet the standards
[1:30:33] of the message.
[1:30:35] You cannot be perfect.
[1:30:38] You're going to church and it seems that
[1:30:40] nothing is happening.
[1:30:44] But what a beautiful day when I heard of
[1:30:46] a king that was looking for me,
[1:30:49] that wanted to give me a position of
[1:30:51] honor.
[1:30:53] Was I deserving? I wasn't. I was not
[1:30:57] deserving what the king did for me.
[1:31:01] What can you say for you this morning?
[1:31:03] Amen. Or I didn't deserve that you call
[1:31:06] my name. Hallelujah. I didn't deserve
[1:31:08] that you get me out of that love
[1:31:10] condition, Lord.
[1:31:13] But it was it wasn't me, Lord. But it
[1:31:15] pleased you to make me a partaker of who
[1:31:19] you are.
[1:31:21] Amen. I didn't have victory. I was full
[1:31:25] of trials. I'm talking from experience.
[1:31:29] I was full of
[1:31:31] trials and I was always
[1:31:34] defeated. But now I am more than a
[1:31:37] conqueror.
[1:31:39] Why is that? Is because of my my my own
[1:31:42] ability. No, it's because of the king's
[1:31:45] That's right. Amen. The king's shout and
[1:31:49] the and the shout of the king is in the
[1:31:52] camp. Amen. The king is calling you. The
[1:31:55] king is calling you out of your lovear
[1:31:58] condition and say that's not your that's
[1:32:00] not who you are. You are not a defeated
[1:32:03] person. You are not you're not a you
[1:32:05] cannot be living there for the rest of
[1:32:07] your days. Now you're more than a
[1:32:09] conqueror.
[1:32:11] Will you come? Hallelujah.
[1:32:14] And now the king look at this. the the
[1:32:16] kings the king David sent and brought
[1:32:18] him from the house of Mahir son of Aniad
[1:32:21] out of Lavar and Mephibosed son of
[1:32:23] Jonathan the son of Saul came to David
[1:32:25] and fell on his face and did obeisance.
[1:32:27] So he was still there you know bowing
[1:32:29] before the king and David said and he
[1:32:32] answered behold your servant.
[1:32:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:32:37] Now the king knew his
[1:32:41] name. The king was able to call him by
[1:32:44] his name.
[1:32:47] There was no doubt. There was not a
[1:32:50] doubt in Meibos's heart that he had
[1:32:52] found grace in the eyes of the king.
[1:32:55] Amen.
[1:32:58] And now I was I was studying. I was
[1:33:00] like, what does it mean when the king
[1:33:01] calls you by your
[1:33:03] name? That means a level of
[1:33:06] informality and also potentially a
[1:33:09] closer relationship
[1:33:11] than with the rest of his subjects.
[1:33:15] Now you have been called by your name.
[1:33:18] And it's like my earthly name. No, by
[1:33:20] the name that is above all names. The
[1:33:23] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Who had
[1:33:27] despised the day of the small things. I
[1:33:30] was I am a small thing in the kingdom of
[1:33:32] God in the economy of God. And he has
[1:33:35] brought me from that love of our
[1:33:37] condition.
[1:33:40] There is much to say, but I just want to
[1:33:42] finish with this perhaps.
[1:33:46] When we talk about relationships,
[1:33:48] whether it is about
[1:33:50] authenticity, safety, and grace, it can
[1:33:54] happen in a group setting or or
[1:33:56] oneonone, but there is a common thread.
[1:33:58] And and I I want you to hear this. We
[1:34:01] were wounded in relationships, right?
[1:34:05] But we also heal
[1:34:08] in relationships. That's right. God
[1:34:11] provides forgiveness, but he uses
[1:34:14] relationships to provide confessions
[1:34:18] healing power.
[1:34:20] Why? There is power in your confession.
[1:34:23] That's right. There is power when you
[1:34:25] recognize where you are in your walk
[1:34:28] with Christ and you say, "Lord, I am not
[1:34:31] what I want to be and I am not what I
[1:34:33] you what I must be. But one thing I know
[1:34:36] that I am not what I used to be."
[1:34:39] Can you said that this morning? Lord, I
[1:34:41] am not what I used to be. Lord,
[1:34:46] amen. Lord, we can say this one more
[1:34:49] thing. Shame is only combed in the
[1:34:51] context of relationship. And this is a
[1:34:53] Christian counselor that is talking
[1:34:55] about it. He says, "When I am able to be
[1:34:57] honest, I show you who I am, who I
[1:35:01] really am. And instead of
[1:35:03] rejecting, instead of rejecting me or
[1:35:06] judging me or criticizing me, you love
[1:35:08] me, you embrace me, you walk with me,
[1:35:11] you become an ally and a
[1:35:15] friend. What is the body of Christ
[1:35:18] supposed to be
[1:35:19] doing? When somebody that was coming to
[1:35:22] church and that person leaves the
[1:35:25] church, then the person comes
[1:35:28] again, what is the body of Christ
[1:35:30] supposed to be doing?
[1:35:32] Oh, I don't know what you're doing here
[1:35:34] in church. You're a sinner. But what is
[1:35:37] the body of Christ supposed to be doing?
[1:35:39] It's supposed to bring in that supposed
[1:35:41] to bring that healing to that person.
[1:35:44] Hey, sister. Hey, brother. We haven't
[1:35:45] seen you in a long time, but we're happy
[1:35:47] to see you here. You know, those words
[1:35:50] can change the eternal destination of a
[1:35:53] person.
[1:35:55] Instead of telling that person, oh,
[1:35:56] you're a sinner because you have been
[1:35:58] missing church.
[1:35:59] Oh you sister you have done this to your
[1:36:02] hair or because we again we come back to
[1:36:05] the beginning. We men we look at the
[1:36:08] outer appearance but God is looking at
[1:36:11] the heart. Amen. What if that person
[1:36:13] that is coming is it may be their last
[1:36:16] chance. Right? What if that person is
[1:36:19] there in the service and is is is about
[1:36:22] to make a final decision whether or not
[1:36:25] they want to keep serving the Lord or
[1:36:27] they go in the
[1:36:29] world? What are we going to say to them?
[1:36:34] Are we going to judge them or are we
[1:36:37] going to embrace them?
[1:36:40] Are we going to criticize them or are we
[1:36:42] going to praise them?
[1:36:47] It makes all the difference in the world
[1:36:50] when someone becomes a friend. And again
[1:36:54] talking about a personal or in intimate
[1:36:56] relationship with Christ that when he
[1:36:59] becomes a friend, you can just go to
[1:37:01] your friend and I I can I can tell you
[1:37:04] from experience. I can go to him as my
[1:37:06] friend. I say, "Lord, I'm not feeling
[1:37:08] good today." That's good. And I ask him,
[1:37:10] "So, will you show me what's going on?"
[1:37:13] And he shows me. Yeah. Then you go to
[1:37:15] bed and then in the middle of the night
[1:37:17] that that's what David said. Even in in
[1:37:19] in my in my dreams, in my sleep, you're
[1:37:21] still there still there
[1:37:27] now shame dissipates and I'm able just
[1:37:31] to just know I am loved by others and I
[1:37:34] am loved by God and I can love others
[1:37:38] and I can also love
[1:37:40] myself because that's what Jesus said.
[1:37:43] And now when you love someone, what is
[1:37:46] that person going to be doing? Now that
[1:37:48] person, that person can make different
[1:37:51] choices
[1:37:53] because now it's like, oh, there is
[1:37:54] someone that loves me. This there is
[1:37:57] someone that cares for me. What am I
[1:37:59] supposed to be
[1:38:02] doing? Oh, we're going to bring them to
[1:38:04] church and we're going to scrape. There
[1:38:06] was a situation at a church when there a
[1:38:08] sister make a mist made a big mistake
[1:38:10] and they brought her in front of the
[1:38:12] congregation and everybody was screaming
[1:38:15] at her uh you're a sinner sinner
[1:38:18] sinner is that the love of Christ
[1:38:26] what I like here when comes to David
[1:38:29] says fear not
[1:38:33] isn't that something he comes to him And
[1:38:36] because you know he was part of David's
[1:38:39] enemies.
[1:38:40] So he now comes to David and David says
[1:38:43] fear not.
[1:38:45] And that's what your David is telling
[1:38:47] you this morning. Fear not.
[1:38:50] Fear not.
[1:38:52] I believe that that is a man after God's
[1:38:55] own heart. A man like God's heart. That
[1:38:59] is like you know I know you were part of
[1:39:01] my enemies. I know you were you you are
[1:39:03] coming from from from the tribe of uh of
[1:39:06] Benjamin but I know one thing that my
[1:39:09] heart is like the father's heart and the
[1:39:12] father hearts the father's heart is a
[1:39:15] heart of compassion
[1:39:18] but a a father that he also will bring
[1:39:21] correction but he's more willing to give
[1:39:24] love more than he's willing to bring the
[1:39:27] correction because do you think that the
[1:39:30] father's heart is to to to to bring pain
[1:39:33] to his children? Certainly not. But he
[1:39:37] wants to bring that peace that in that
[1:39:39] atmosphere of love, you can be healed.
[1:39:43] And that because of that love that you
[1:39:45] have received, now you can make the
[1:39:47] right choices. Now you can say, "Lord,
[1:39:50] because I love you so much, now I'm not
[1:39:53] going to go to the wrong website. Now
[1:39:55] I'm not going to go and drink a a have a
[1:39:58] a a social drink. Now Lord, I'm going to
[1:40:01] I'm going I'm going to be in church. Now
[1:40:04] Lord, I'm going to love my brother. I'm
[1:40:06] going to love my
[1:40:08] sister. Because everything we make,
[1:40:11] everything you do, excuse me, we do it
[1:40:13] out of
[1:40:16] love. Meos had a place at the
[1:40:19] table. We can finish here. We have more
[1:40:22] here. But I think it's is good. How many
[1:40:25] meosets in Loar can be found this
[1:40:27] morning? But the Lord is saying, you
[1:40:29] know what? He's wooing you to say, you
[1:40:31] know what? I don't want you to stay in
[1:40:33] Labar. I don't want you to stay in that
[1:40:36] sad condition in that I don't want you
[1:40:39] to stay in those complexes. I don't want
[1:40:41] you to be to be dwelling in your
[1:40:43] mistakes.
[1:40:47] Why wouldn't you come out of that place?
[1:40:50] Why wouldn't you come out of that
[1:40:52] condition and come to the king's table?
[1:40:57] Would you like to have a seat at the
[1:40:58] king's table this morning?
[1:41:01] Would you bow your head this morning if
[1:41:03] the musicians can come?
[1:41:07] And there in your
[1:41:08] heart, even if you haven't received
[1:41:11] salvation to your heart, will you say,
[1:41:14] "Lord, will you give salvation to me
[1:41:17] this
[1:41:18] morning? Will you save my
[1:41:21] life? Will you fill me with the Holy
[1:41:24] Ghost?
[1:41:25] Will you bring me out of that condition
[1:41:28] Lord? Where I am told I am not good
[1:41:31] enough. Where I am told I was never
[1:41:34] affirmed what my father I was never
[1:41:37] affirmed by my mother.
[1:41:40] Lord, will you be my father? Will you be
[1:41:43] my mother? Amen.
[1:41:46] Will you be my friend this morning?
[1:41:50] Will you build an altar this morning
[1:41:51] there at at your at your seat and say,
[1:41:55] "Lord, I want more of you this
[1:41:59] morning. You know me by my
[1:42:02] name. You know my trials. You know my
[1:42:06] tribulations. You know my temptations.
[1:42:09] Father, you know
[1:42:11] me. You know when I wake up. You know
[1:42:14] when when I lay down. You know the words
[1:42:17] that I say to my wife. You know the
[1:42:19] words that I say to my children.
[1:42:22] Father, if there is something that is
[1:42:24] not pleasing before you,
[1:42:26] Lord, will you bring out of will you
[1:42:28] bring me out of those complexes, Lord,
[1:42:31] out of those mistakes that I can bring
[1:42:33] them under your blood, Father, that you
[1:42:36] can bring that restor full restoration
[1:42:39] to my
[1:42:40] life? that you can bring that full
[1:42:43] joy that is unspeakable and full of
[1:42:46] glory.
[1:42:48] Father, here your children are this
[1:42:50] morning.
[1:42:51] Lord, some maybe with uh broken hearts,
[1:42:56] Father. Maybe with spirits that have
[1:42:59] been damaged by ministries, Lord, or or
[1:43:02] by relationships,
[1:43:04] Father. But this morning, we're coming
[1:43:07] to the right place. This morning we're
[1:43:10] coming to the to to to the to to to to
[1:43:12] the to the right uh table, Father. And
[1:43:16] that is at your table, Father.
[1:43:20] You have extended that invitation to us
[1:43:23] this morning, Lord. And you say, "Come
[1:43:26] unto me all that are weary and heavy
[1:43:30] laden, and I will give you
[1:43:33] rest." Father, will you give Will you do
[1:43:36] that for your children this morning,
[1:43:37] Lord?
[1:43:40] Lord, if there is a mother this morning
[1:43:43] suffering because of the children not
[1:43:45] serving you or the husband not serving,
[1:43:48] not serving you, Lord, may you bring
[1:43:51] that peace knowing that everything is
[1:43:53] under your control. Father, there is
[1:43:57] nothing that is catching you by
[1:43:59] surprise.
[1:44:01] Father, we thank you, Jesus. We bless
[1:44:05] your name this morning. Hallelujah. We
[1:44:08] just going to be at your table.
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:12] We love you,
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:19] Father. So I run to the Father again and
[1:44:25] again.
[1:44:28] Oh Lord, I've carried a
[1:44:34] burden too long on my
[1:44:39] own. Lord, I wasn't
[1:44:46] created to bear it all.
[1:44:51] Amen. Lord, I your
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:58] invitation to let it all go. Lord, I see
[1:45:03] it now. I lay it there. And I know that
[1:45:10] I need you. I run to the father. I fall
[1:45:17] into grace. I'm done with the hiding. No
[1:45:23] reason to wait. Oh, my heart needs a
[1:45:27] surgeon. My soul needs a friend. The
[1:45:31] sorrow to the father again and again and
[1:45:37] again and again.
[1:45:42] Oh,
[1:45:45] wo

[1:45:49] again, Lord, I've carried a
[1:45:56] burden for too long on my own.
[1:46:03] Lord, I wasn't
[1:46:08] created to bear it
[1:46:13] along. I hear your
[1:46:19] invitation to let it all go. But I see
[1:46:24] it now. I'm laying it down. And I know
[1:46:30] that I need you. I run to the father. I
[1:46:38] fall into grace. I'm done with the
[1:46:43] hiding. No reason to wait. Oh, my heart
[1:46:47] needs a searching. My soul needs a
[1:46:51] friend. So I run to the father again and
[1:46:56] again and again and
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:06] again.
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:11] Oh Lord, you saw my
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:17] condition. You had a plan from the
[1:47:20] start.
[1:47:23] Lord your son for
[1:47:28] redemption the price for my all. Yes.
[1:47:35] And I don't have a
[1:47:40] contest for that kind of love. I don't
[1:47:45] understand. But Lord, I can't
[1:47:48] comprehend.
[1:47:49] All I know is
[1:47:52] I need you. I run to the father. I fall
[1:47:59] into grace. I'm done with the hiding, a
[1:48:04] reason to wait. Oh, my heart needs a
[1:48:08] searching. My soul needs a friend. So I
[1:48:12] run to the father again and again. I
[1:48:17] run. I run to the father. I fall into
[1:48:22] grace. Lord, I am done with the hiding.
[1:48:26] No reason to wait. Oh, my heart needs a
[1:48:31] searching. My soul needs a friend. So I
[1:48:35] run to the father again and again and
[1:48:40] again and again.
[1:48:45] [Music]
