[23:00] your
[23:04] yes Lord Jesus amen I believe there's no
[23:10] greater honor that we could we could
[23:12] give him tonight that we would provide
[23:14] him and let him have his own way amen
[23:19] you know you think many times in the
[23:21] scripture when we look at the Simon had
[23:25] invited him to his house and Simon
[23:28] invited him there with the wrong purpose
[23:31] but yet Jesus had an appointment Simon
[23:35] wasn't even aware that there was a
[23:37] person coming that he would not have
[23:39] even allowed to darken his door if he
[23:43] had known beforehand but you know there
[23:46] was a woman that believed him to be the
[23:50] Messiah and that's the reason Jesus took
[23:54] that appointment to come to Simon's
[23:56] house because he knew she would be there
[23:59] the one that invited him did not welcome
[24:03] him but the one who was not invited
[24:06] welcomed him and that's exactly that
[24:10] where it is with our lives here as
[24:12] Gentiles we were not invited amen it was
[24:17] to the Jews but the hidden mystery was
[24:20] in there that God would bring about he
[24:23] would have a special meeting with every
[24:25] one of our lives and those who were
[24:27] uninvited by the covenants yet God knew
[24:30] each and every one of us that there
[24:33] would be a welcoming in our hearts of
[24:36] his life oh my it's more that Minds can
[24:40] comprehend it's a reality amen so we
[24:43] just we thank God for His mercy this
[24:45] evening and brother bill already
[24:48] mentioned it but I want to say welcome
[24:50] back sister Caroline's sister need it

[24:56] we are revoking your visa passport
[25:00] whatever that you need for Costa Rica
[25:02] its revoked with tonight we want to just
[25:07] in just a few moments we're going to
[25:09] turn our attention to the word and
[25:10] invite brother Sampson Shetty here from
[25:13] India we're so glad to have brother
[25:14] Sampson with us he's been coming by here
[25:17] for I believe brother Sampson mentioned
[25:19] to me today for seven years since since
[25:21] 2012 so we just certainly just counted
[25:24] an honor is a great friend
[25:26] amen of the congregation of ours here
[25:29] and so in a labor in the gospel so we
[25:31] just so appreciate what the Lord has
[25:33] done and is doing amen in the ministry
[25:35] there in India also want to make a also
[25:39] very important announcement I want to
[25:41] just tell my wife happy anniversary and
[25:50] then 21 years and the Lord has been so
[25:53] good to me
[25:53] I hope she can say the same thing but
[25:58] the Lord knew just exactly what I needed
[26:00] and I'm so glad that God he he watches
[26:04] over our lives to direct us and the
[26:06] decisions that we make men I really just
[26:08] appreciate her and truly you know
[26:10] without the help of the Lord we couldn't
[26:12] do what we do but I really could not do
[26:14] and stand as God has called me to stand
[26:18] without her and that's a truth she's
[26:20] there to she's right as a support she's
[26:22] right behind the vision and the work no
[26:24] matter what it is something comes on my
[26:26] heart she's ready to move right in it
[26:28] whether it's for the church here or it's
[26:30] you know elsewhere she's right in there
[26:32] with the vision and you know I know that
[26:35] that's not something that I have to
[26:36] persuade but that's what God has put in
[26:38] her heart it's a reality brother Ram
[26:40] said when God calls the man he calls the
[26:42] wife also Amen so we just thank God for
[26:45] all of his works and and tonight we I
[26:49] wanted brother Carlos had just requested
[26:51] before he comes but we would just have
[26:53] prayer with our brother tomorrow he is
[26:55] going to be going into surgery there in
[26:58] the morning and so we just want to just
[27:01] ask prayer and you might wonder
[27:02] we doing it at this time of the service
[27:04] well brother Carlos had requested it
[27:06] because tonight brother Trevor brother
[27:09] Trevor raise your hand now if you
[27:11] haven't seen brother Trevor just take a
[27:12] look at him he don't mind you staring at
[27:14] him but the Lord has really touched
[27:18] brother brother Trevor's heart and I
[27:21] don't even know brother Trevor when it
[27:22] was that that he'd given your heart to

[27:30] of July and when the presence of the
[27:32] Lord just come right there in that
[27:34] hospital room and you know I believe it
[27:36] was a divine appointment I believe that
[27:38] and you just see even in his life the
[27:41] things we were even just the other day
[27:43] just testifying as what God is doing in
[27:46] his life just things just fleeing and we
[27:48] just thank God for his working amen God
[27:51] is a living God in him amen so the
[27:54] reason I said that is because brother
[27:56] Trevor's gonna be baptized tonight in
[27:58] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so
[28:04] brother Carlos is gonna be a part of
[28:06] that so we want to just we want to

[40:38] Zambia burner Emmanuel challi was with
[40:42] us and we had a special meetings
[40:46] ministers meeting in the morning and and
[40:48] evening regular service and many people
[40:52] attended hundreds and hundreds of people
[40:54] were there our church building was
[40:56] packed up and there was no more room
[40:59] inside of church so we put out tents
[41:03] outside and the people were sitting
[41:05] outside and before the people came to
[41:08] the altar when they when he was spraying
[41:11] for the sick people while they're
[41:14] walking towards him the presence of God
[41:17] was so powerful so rich and the people
[41:20] were like falling down you know and you
[41:24] know nobody you know done anything but
[41:26] the the presence of God was so powerful
[41:28] the people fell down and you know many
[41:31] people got healed you know so this is in
[41:35] our church so we are working on our
[41:38] chair in the church we are putting the
[41:41] ceiling especially in the summertime
[41:44] this year we had almost close to 120
[41:48] degrees Farenheit summer which is 48 49
[41:53] degrees Celsius so very hot so we try to
[41:57] do some sealing work so we have started
[42:02] but due to some financial situation so
[42:06] it was stopped right there so pre please
[42:10] pray for us pray for our you know
[42:12] sealing in the church
[42:17] and here some of the baptisms we believe
[42:22] in baptisms right we believe in water
[42:24] baptisms I don't know some of the
[42:26] churches in the message you know they
[42:29] banned baptisms and communion and feet
[42:31] washing and they said they're coming
[42:33] coming of the Lord is already done you
[42:36] know he already came I don't know all
[42:39] these strange doctrines but we believe
[42:41] in water baptism three divine ordinances
[42:45] water baptism Communion and feet washing
[42:48] amen so these people came out from
[42:51] Church of Christ you know the young boy
[42:54] young man nickel and supriya they
[42:58] accepted this message and got rebaptised
[43:01] praise the Lord so here you see in our
[43:10] church so we we had a special
[43:13] conventions in the month of January we
[43:17] had our church anniversary services
[43:21] here you see my family my lovely wife
[43:24] sister Swarna and also my eldest
[43:28] daughter sailor faith Suzanne Elizabeth
[43:30] and my son Samuel Larry
[43:34] and here you see in our church you know
[43:37] backside a brother from Ghana brother
[43:41] Thomas we had meeting with him in in the
[43:46] month of March so and here are some of
[43:52] the baptisms these people came from I
[43:56] mean they're there they are Indians but
[43:58] they are there they're living in Saudi
[44:00] Arabia and they are related to one of
[44:04] the family in our church so they came
[44:07] visiting us and they heard this message
[44:10] and the brothers introduced the message
[44:12] to them and they you know they accepted
[44:15] this truth and I think they are
[44:17] Presbyterians something like that
[44:18] denomination and they came out from that
[44:21] and they accepted this message and got
[44:23] rebaptised yeah and here is a problem
[44:29] you know that house you see in the other
[44:33] screen it's it is our Hindu neighbors
[44:38] located right beside of our church they
[44:42] are causing many problems and
[44:44] interrupting our services and they're
[44:47] like a big stumbling block right in the
[44:50] middle of the property so they were
[44:54] there since almost 35 40 years so before
[44:59] we started this church and you know had
[45:01] you know we built the building you know
[45:04] so these people we have paid for almost
[45:10] for their hundred square yards of land
[45:12] and that house we paid it's a you know
[45:16] we made an agreement they demanded more
[45:20] like 25,000 30,000 something like that
[45:23] but when we talk to them and motivated
[45:27] and convinced so it came to fifteen
[45:31] thousand US dollars so we paid $7,500 on
[45:36] that property and you know we made an
[45:40] agreement so we have to pay another 7500
[45:44] and they said you know we will wait for
[45:48] for a while and they said you can pay in
[45:52] three three payments like three
[45:54] installments 2500 2500 and 2500 so
[45:58] please pray for this problem when
[46:01] brother Gary Walker was with us in 2017

[53:42] the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak
[53:45] unto the children of Israel and take off
[53:49] every one of them a rod according to the
[53:52] house of their fathers of all their
[53:56] princes according to the house of their
[53:58] fathers 12 rods write down every man's
[54:02] name upon his rod and thou shalt write
[54:05] Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi for
[54:11] one rod shall be for the head of the
[54:15] house of their fathers and thou shalt
[54:18] lay them up in the tabernacle of the
[54:21] congregation before the testimony where
[54:25] I will meet with you and it shall come
[54:28] to pass that the man's roared whom I
[54:31] shall choose shall blossom and I will
[54:35] make to cease from me the murmuring
[54:38] murmurings of the children of Israel
[54:40] whereby the
[54:42] murmur again sto and Moses speak unto
[54:46] the children of Israel and every one of
[54:48] their princes give him a rod apiece for
[54:53] each Prince one according to their
[54:56] fathers houses even 12 rods and the rod
[55:00] of Aaron was among their rods and Moses
[55:04] laid up the roars before the Lord in the
[55:09] tabernacle of witness and it came to
[55:12] pass that on the morrow Moses went into
[55:15] the tabernacle of witness and behold the
[55:18] roar of Aaron for the house of Levi was
[55:24] budded and brought forth birds and
[55:28] bloomed blossoms and yielded ailments

[56:59] brothers and sisters Shekinah glory we
[57:05] are here in that wonderful name the name

[58:46] was idol worshiper he was with his
[58:51] father he was in his land but God had
[58:56] chosen him when God chooses you and me
[59:00] when God had chosen you and me he has a
[59:05] process or a procedure a plan that he
[59:09] will separate you from it's not mingle
[59:14] with or mixed waita unbelief and belief
[59:19] and darkness and light and and and and

[1:04:24] running and kneeled down it is in the
[1:04:26] presence of God and said good master
[1:04:28] what shall I do for to inherit the
[1:04:31] eternal ah

[1:04:36] there is only good Jesus that is God Hey
[1:04:40] and he said jesus said go and just you
[1:04:43] know do all the 10 commandments obey or
[1:04:46] practice or follow what what the law

[1:04:52] since my young going to Sunday school
[1:04:55] youth meetings and everything and he was
[1:05:00] growing but when he came to the revealed

[1:05:33] are doing everything what the prophet
[1:05:35] said and we know the same thing that
[1:05:38] young man he was a message believer he
[1:05:43] was a message believer he believed in
[1:05:45] profit that profit is Moses and his
[1:05:49] reading course he's reading his
[1:05:50] scriptures is reading praying and doing
[1:05:52] everything good but he has to come into
[1:05:58] the order of a divine order which God
[1:06:02] provided for that day a men are men

[1:07:22] Testament even this man he couldn't
[1:07:26] write his own name like an educator a
[1:07:33] Fisher man by the revelation of Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ he's writing the same Scripture
[1:07:41] hallelujah and is saying that you is
[1:07:47] pointing this scripture to the people
[1:07:51] those who are Gentiles hallelujah he
[1:07:58] said ye are a chosen generation the same
[1:08:01] scripture was mentioned it was said to
[1:08:05] Israel and now the same scripture it is
[1:08:09] mentioned here he wrote in the New
[1:08:13] Testament here you don't see this is for
[1:08:20] Jews only now this is not for Israel
[1:08:25] this is not for Jews only in Deuteronomy
[1:08:29] it was for Jews and the Jewish people or
[1:08:34] Israel people and natural Abraham seed
[1:08:37] they thought that this is the scripture
[1:08:41] only belongs to us only this brick this
[1:08:45] scripture belongs to only for us not for
[1:08:48] any other nation only only for Israel
[1:08:52] not for India not for America not for
[1:08:57] Africa they are not chosen generation in
[1:09:01] the Old Testament God had chosen them
[1:09:05] but God chosen ever hand from Chaldean
[1:09:09] land and God brought him from Gentile
[1:09:12] and he made them he made him a nation
[1:09:16] out of Abraham God made you know at
[1:09:20] twelve tribes in the twelve tribes you
[1:09:23] see you know my precious brothers and
[1:09:27] sister please bear with me tonight
[1:09:29] I don't want to take much time I know
[1:09:31] this is a midweek service so God had
[1:09:36] chosen Abraham and from him 12 tribes
[1:09:40] and God chosen Levi a tribe of Levi for
[1:09:48] priesthood to do ministry in the
[1:09:51] tabernacle he heeded appointed or
[1:09:56] elected or choosing any other tribe to
[1:10:00] come into the presence or into the
[1:10:04] tabernacle to do the ministry in the
[1:10:07] church or in the mean in the in the
[1:10:09] tabernacle in the temple just only Levi
[1:10:12] we all want that one time was ayah he
[1:10:16] thought I'm doing good I'm rolling nice
[1:10:19] and my kingdom is good the Lord blessed
[1:10:23] me and blessed and he thought I can take
[1:10:29] some offerings into the temple I can do
[1:10:34] this I am eligible to this to do this
[1:10:38] and worthy to do this but you know what
[1:10:41] brothers and sisters that is not God's
[1:10:44] that wasn't God's divine order God has
[1:10:48] never called him for that purpose but
[1:10:51] never whatever you know whatever calling
[1:10:54] you have in your life whatever whatever
[1:10:57] ministry God that God placed in your in
[1:11:00] your life if God called you as a lay
[1:11:04] member if God called you as a song
[1:11:06] leader if God called you as a minister
[1:11:08] if God called you as a deacon trustee if
[1:11:13] God called you first for certain thing
[1:11:16] Bella Branham said you got to stay in
[1:11:19] your position you have to stay in your
[1:11:22] position and and rest of the priest said
[1:11:27] to Isaiah sir King we respect you we
[1:11:31] honor you but this is not your duty this
[1:11:35] is not your duty to come into the to the
[1:11:38] tabernacle or to the temple and take up
[1:11:41] this all the offering
[1:11:42] going into into the presence of God this
[1:11:44] is not you to do this you're not called
[1:11:49] to do to do this praise the Lord
[1:11:51] hallelujah but he didn't care and he
[1:11:54] said oh no I can do this but when he
[1:11:58] went into the temple the Lord cursed him
[1:12:02] with the leprosy so that means we came
[1:12:06] to understand that only the levi's are
[1:12:11] appointed are called to do the ministry
[1:12:17] in the presence of Almighty God one time
[1:12:21] David was trying to bring that that arc
[1:12:24] from Philistines and he put that arc in
[1:12:28] the on the new ox cart it shouldn't be
[1:12:34] that way it has to be in another way
[1:12:38] which God provided way it has to be laid
[1:12:41] or or you know carried on the Levi's
[1:12:45] shoulders but Darrell thought that I'm a
[1:12:50] king God can understand me you know but
[1:12:54] that's not God's order it's not God's
[1:12:58] divine order it has to come on the
[1:13:02] Levi's shoulders so hope you're catching
[1:13:06] my thought so what about us tonight what
[1:13:12] about us tonight see we are like the or
[1:13:18] not belongs to Abraham's you know
[1:13:20] naturally speaking we are not belong to
[1:13:22] any Abraham family we are Gentiles
[1:13:35] Jewish people they eat different kind
[1:13:37] they eat certain certain things but we
[1:13:40] eat all all things some of the Indian
[1:13:43] people they don't eat pork most of the
[1:13:44] Indian people they don't eat pork they
[1:13:47] don't eat beef they have their you know
[1:13:51] traditions cultures customs and way of
[1:13:56] doing things everything is different but
[1:14:00] see my brothers and sisters when you
[1:14:03] read this scripture first Peter 2:9 how
[1:14:08] come that we are chosen generation a
[1:14:14] royal priesthood kings and priests are
[1:14:20] an holy nation a peculiar people praise
[1:14:25] the Lord
[1:14:26] so my brothers and sisters in the Old
[1:14:30] Testament God chosen Kings and brought
[1:14:34] Kings
[1:14:34] raised up Kings from Judah tribe and God
[1:14:41] raised a ministers or high priests
[1:14:46] priests and high priests from Levi's
[1:14:50] tribe or Levi's community god has men
[1:14:55] our different ways and he put that
[1:15:00] everything in order he instructed God
[1:15:04] instructed to Moses to do this do that
[1:15:06] do this do that and you need to put
[1:15:09] everything see I would like to read in
[1:15:12] Hebrews chapter 7
[1:15:13] I mean Hebrews chapter 9 let's read here
[1:15:17] he said you know chapter 9 and verse 1
[1:15:21] to 4 then really the first covenant had
[1:15:26] also ordinances of divine service and a
[1:15:30] worldly sanctuary for there was a
[1:15:34] tabernacle made the first variant was
[1:15:37] the candlestick and the table and the
[1:15:40] sherbert which is called the sanctuary
[1:15:43] and after the second whale the
[1:15:46] tabernacle which is called the holiest
[1:15:48] of all which had the golden censer and
[1:15:51] the Ark of the Covenant overlaid and
[1:15:54] round a boat with gold and varen was the
[1:15:58] golden pot that had manna and Aaron's
[1:16:02] rod that budded and the tables of the
[1:16:06] Covenant so here st. Paul is explaining
[1:16:12] or writing about the old tabernacle
[1:16:15] which has three cords like outer public
[1:16:18] and and holiest of Holies and holiest of
[1:16:22] Holies you know so whatever God told
[1:16:26] Moses to keep in order everything was in
[1:16:31] order and in the especially in the
[1:16:35] holiest of Holies you see we read here
[1:16:40] there was a candle you know the golden
[1:16:44] part with manna
[1:16:46] and Aaron's roared and also tables of
[1:16:50] the Covenant the 10 commandments that's
[1:16:53] the natural so brother branham's said
[1:16:58] about the three rooms house natural
[1:17:04] types spiritual three rooms house every
[1:17:09] house has three rooms God works in three
[1:17:15] in three comings three sons names and
[1:17:20] three offices
[1:17:22] everything is three three three you know
[1:17:25] so here you see the tabernacle in them
[1:17:29] in the wilderness it was you know Hara I
[1:17:34] don't know how to put in English it's a
[1:17:36] in the three parts right yeah one two
[1:17:40] three you know so everyone can come into
[1:17:44] the you know first you know first what
[1:17:47] you call first room or first court and
[1:17:51] some people can come into the holiest of
[1:17:54] you know the holy place you know where
[1:17:56] the candlestick and through bread but
[1:17:59] when you you know if you read here to
[1:18:03] the down you know if you read further
[1:18:05] you see that the high priest only high
[1:18:11] priest once a year he's entering into
[1:18:15] the holiest of Holies and when he was
[1:18:19] going there they put a robe to him or a
[1:18:22] big what you call that thing wrong if he
[1:18:27] has done anything wrong a mistake or
[1:18:29] sinned when he went into into the
[1:18:32] holiest of Holies if he dies
[1:18:35] nobody is going to run into that you
[1:18:37] know sacred place where the Shekinah
[1:18:39] glory in the presence of Shekinah glory
[1:18:43] God said I am going to come and meet you
[1:18:47] there
[1:18:49] aha
[1:18:51] it's not for everyone your guests may
[1:18:55] come to your kitchen and they eat there
[1:18:58] they go to the living room and
[1:19:01] fellowship and talk but the bedroom is
[1:19:04] not for everyone
[1:19:06] hope you're catching my word so we help
[1:19:12] to realize who we are now how we came
[1:19:16] how we become a royal priesthood even
[1:19:21] our Lord Jesus Christ wasn't
[1:19:26] he was not came from Levi stripe
[1:19:32] he wasn't if you if you if you read the
[1:19:37] scripture he was he was not he was not a
[1:19:41] priest community he wasn't belongs to a
[1:19:43] priest community but here one I preached
[1:19:49] this message in in my church and by the
[1:19:53] help of the Lord and the I asked the
[1:19:56] people in my church I asked them how we
[1:19:59] become a royal priesthood how we become
[1:20:03] a king kings and priests
[1:20:05] how come and our people you know some of
[1:20:09] the ministers and the believers in the
[1:20:11] church they said by Jesus Christ I said
[1:20:14] even Jesus Christ is not belongs to
[1:20:17] priesthood community
[1:20:21] naturally speaking but how God made us
[1:20:26] if you read in revelations chapter five
[1:20:30] let's go to that little relation chapter
[1:20:32] five the seven sealed book amen chapter
[1:20:37] five and verse nine and ten and they
[1:20:40] sung a new song saying thou art worthy
[1:20:43] to take the book and to open the seals
[1:20:46] thereof for thou was slain and hast
[1:20:51] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:20:57] every kindred not only from Jews not
[1:21:03] only from you know Abraham natural seed
[1:21:06] but every kindred and tongue Telugu
[1:21:10] Hindi Marathi Spanish British English
[1:21:15] everything every tongue and people and
[1:21:19] nation and has made us
[1:21:24] has made us unto our God kings and
[1:21:31] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:21:36] the same holy spirit-inspired
[1:21:43] the same holy spirit which was in Moses
[1:21:48] after the dispensational change it came
[1:21:52] into the
[1:21:55] disciples Peter here is writing the same
[1:22:00] scripture which was written Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] was same yesterday today and forever so
[1:22:11] in the Old Testament the same scripture
[1:22:14] was written for natural seed of Abraham
[1:22:18] and in the New Testament it will it is
[1:22:21] written for a spiritual seed of Abraham
[1:22:28] which is we today amen
[1:22:32] so how we become a spiritual seed like a
[1:22:39] kings and priests in India we have cast
[1:22:43] a system we have a communities different
[1:22:45] caste different communities different
[1:22:47] tribes different things you know and we
[1:22:50] have our kings community also when they
[1:22:55] have a you know big celebration the
[1:22:57] Kings are like a big and everything is
[1:23:00] and we have a priest community also
[1:23:03] audience when they tested their DNA the
[1:23:08] blur and all these they found that their
[1:23:12] fathers came from Jews I mean Israel
[1:23:17] from Aaronic you know family from Lima
[1:23:23] so when this Israel or Abraham C natural
[1:23:29] seed was scattered all over the world
[1:23:31] they went to they came to India also so
[1:23:36] I'm not talking about the natural thing
[1:23:38] but here tonight my precious brothers
[1:23:41] and sisters we are a spiritual kings and
[1:23:46] priests and Jesus Christ made us unto
[1:23:53] God a kings and priests to reign forever
[1:23:59] praise the name of the Lord but my
[1:24:02] question I asked in my church I said how
[1:24:05] we become a
[1:24:07] it's not a Christian thing how we become
[1:24:10] priests how we become pings
[1:24:12] they said Jesus Christ okay
[1:24:16] when you search the Scriptures Jesus
[1:24:20] came from Abraham you know family but
[1:24:26] not from Levi's tribe he came from Judah
[1:24:31] praise the Lord
[1:24:33] of course you know my precious brothers
[1:24:35] and sisters but tonight this evening and
[1:24:37] just whatever the Lord puts on my heart
[1:24:39] I'm just sharing with you hope you are
[1:24:41] catching my thought this evening so but
[1:24:46] here we read well brother branham said
[1:24:48] if we have a bible question there is a
[1:24:52] Bible answer
[1:24:53] a man so it is not that we came or Jesus
[1:25:02] Christ our Lord Jesus came through
[1:25:05] Aaronic priesthood divine order but
[1:25:09] there is another greater than Aaronic
[1:25:13] priesthood order a divine order which is
[1:25:17] Melchizedek a man and we read here
[1:25:21] hebrews chapter 7 and it says chapter 1
[1:25:27] i'm in chapter 7 and verse 1 for this
[1:25:29] Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the
[1:25:33] Most High God he was king and he was
[1:25:38] priest oh my two tribes to communities
[1:25:45] or two categories or two things or in
[1:25:49] one person
[1:25:50] praise the Lord who is this Melchizedek
[1:25:54] you know all these brother branham
[1:25:56] preach that message
[1:25:57] who is this Melchizedek mm-hm and here
[1:26:00] we read here for this Melchizedek king
[1:26:03] of Salem priest of the Most High God who
[1:26:06] made Abraham returning from the
[1:26:08] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[1:26:12] to whom also Abraham Abraham gave a
[1:26:15] tenth part of all force being by in
[1:26:18] interpretation King all
[1:26:20] righteousness and after that also king
[1:26:23] of Salem which is king of peace Abraham
[1:26:29] had our divine revelation after ever had
[1:26:35] won the war won the battle after that
[1:26:43] not before after returning back home
[1:26:48] hallelujah
[1:26:50] after returning back home now he was so
[1:26:53] tired of war he was so tired physically
[1:26:58] maybe in everything you know you were so
[1:27:00] tired coming back home and now he met a
[1:27:03] king king of Salem king of righteousness
[1:27:07] king of peace and whenever had met him
[1:27:13] ever ever ham I told in my church even
[1:27:17] the tenth part the tights before the law
[1:27:21] was given to us it's a divine revelation
[1:27:23] of a Christian believer it's not just it
[1:27:27] says the world Testament says that no
[1:27:30] before the law was given by Moses the
[1:27:34] tenth part was given by Abraham to you
[1:27:38] know to Melchizedek it's a divine
[1:27:41] revelation Abraham he didn't get only
[1:27:44] money but also his time he didn't give
[1:27:48] his only his time
[1:27:49] also his talent talents not only tells
[1:27:52] his efforts not only that but he
[1:27:55] worshiped God he knew that is not only
[1:28:01] the king is also the priest he's not
[1:28:05] only the priest is also king he is
[1:28:08] worthy to be praised and he's worthy to
[1:28:11] take my offering hoo-wah praise the name
[1:28:15] of the Lord before the law was given by
[1:28:20] Moses it's not he didn't went to school
[1:28:25] he didn't went to a church Indian went
[1:28:27] to a service he went he didn't sit under
[1:28:30] the pastor are listening all these you
[1:28:32] have to do
[1:28:33] this you have to do that no no but he's
[1:28:35] got the revelation the personal
[1:28:39] revelation Homa
[1:28:41] that personal revelation brings you into
[1:28:46] the presence of God that pulls you
[1:28:49] hallelujah that pulls you that draws you
[1:28:53] into the presence of God hallelujah and
[1:28:56] he met Melchizedek and the Melchizedek
[1:28:59] y-you know the scripture says here here
[1:29:03] without father without mother without
[1:29:05] descent having neither beginning of days
[1:29:08] nor end of life but made unto the Son of
[1:29:11] God abideth a priest continually amen
[1:29:16] and here the scripture says in the you
[1:29:20] know Book of Psalms chapter 110 and
[1:29:23] verse 4 the Lord had sworn and will not
[1:29:27] repent thou art a priest forever after
[1:29:31] the order of Melchizedek this was a
[1:29:36] prophecy this was a prophecy was you
[1:29:41] know said in the Book of Psalms from
[1:29:45] whom for witness is talking about this
[1:29:50] this was a prophecy given in the Book of
[1:29:55] Psalms is talking about our Lord Jesus
[1:29:58] Christ amen so even though he wasn't
[1:30:03] came from Levi tribe hallelujah but he
[1:30:10] had he came
[1:30:13] in a divine order of melchizedek
[1:30:17] so by Jesus Christ by him not by law not
[1:30:25] by Moses law but by the grace of God so
[1:30:29] that's the reason Paul said here the
[1:30:34] scriptures also said we were not a
[1:30:36] people unto God but by faith in the Son
[1:30:41] of God this afternoon hallelujah praise
[1:30:44] the Lord
[1:30:45] I enjoyed we had a wonderful
[1:30:47] conversation wonderful fellowship this

[1:31:23] she will go in the rapture and there are
[1:31:27] some you know people has to come in like
[1:31:31] the prophet of God said in the seven

[1:33:05] anything but our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:33:09] the new birth and by the new birth new
[1:33:13] burst is a divine revelation a personal
[1:33:17] revelation to each believer it is
[1:33:19] impossible to explain but you know
[1:33:22] sometimes we people think that you know
[1:33:25] we will you know sometimes we will judge
[1:33:27] the people or it's not born again she is
[1:33:30] not born again it will do that but you
[1:33:33] know what when when my son was born when
[1:33:35] my daughter's was born they were not
[1:33:38] perfect naturally speaking they're
[1:33:41] trying to walk they weren't trying to
[1:33:44] say man mom mommy you know their daddy
[1:33:48] you know their if you say something to
[1:33:51] them no you're not speaking right you
[1:33:53] got to speak right no that's not the
[1:33:57] thing
[1:33:57] hope you're catching my so when when
[1:34:00] they were born still the new birth has a
[1:34:04] process going through the process
[1:34:08] walking walking talking we did some
[1:34:12] mistakes see like like disciples Jesus
[1:34:16] called come Simon I will make you a
[1:34:19] fisherman and your name will be Simon
[1:34:21] not assignment now now Peter come and
[1:34:24] follow me come Matthew come Levi come
[1:34:27] Philip come you all come and follow me
[1:34:29] and they all came and they were with
[1:34:31] Jesus Christ for three and a half years
[1:34:32] and their fellowshipping and eating
[1:34:34] together sitting together and and then
[1:34:36] going in the board together and
[1:34:38] and still they have their problems all
[1:34:43] kinds of problems but I don't think I
[1:34:46] don't said that they were not born again
[1:34:48] they are already born again hallelujah
[1:34:53] but they are going through the process
[1:34:57] the new birth and also God's prophet
[1:35:00] said there's a difference between the
[1:35:03] baptism of the Holy Spirit and the new
[1:35:04] birth baptism of the Holy Spirit puts
[1:35:08] you in the position in the body of Jesus
[1:35:10] Christ but the new birth when you fully
[1:35:13] I'm in perfect faith then you believe
[1:35:17] him when you have faith in Him
[1:35:19] it's not like I believe Jesus Christ oh
[1:35:22] I believe it all no no no not saying
[1:35:24] like that but from bottom of your heart
[1:35:27] no shut off doubt when you have faith
[1:35:31] that's faith creates the new birth in
[1:35:35] you that's what the prophets there and
[1:35:38] see and there were new they were born
[1:35:42] again but they're having some issues
[1:35:44] they have some they had some problems
[1:35:47] who's who is greater than me Peter said
[1:35:50] I'm greater than you gaiter than me a
[1:35:52] greater than me you know everybody's
[1:35:54] having a problem but my brother's sister
[1:35:57] tonight
[1:35:58] there we're waiting for the promise of
[1:36:03] God
[1:36:05] and they waited in the upper room for 10
[1:36:08] days for what god is blessing them in
[1:36:14] the body of Christ their positionally
[1:36:17] they're going to be established they're
[1:36:22] waiting for the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:24] Ghost coming in hallelujah
[1:36:27] hope you're catching mine so it is not a
[1:36:30] natural thing but also when you search
[1:36:34] the Scriptures so God is not you know I
[1:36:40] mean I'm trying to you know catch
[1:36:42] translate the things in my mind and you
[1:36:44] know Paul it is not that like how God
[1:36:50] never changes his pattern never changes
[1:36:54] his plan he never changes his divine
[1:36:56] orders but he a brother/sister what
[1:37:00] happens we all thought maybe the Israel
[1:37:03] people may thought that Oh God is not
[1:37:06] God for everyone these God only for for
[1:37:09] us but Paul said now we are going to
[1:37:11] Gentiles I'm leaving you Jews or Israel
[1:37:18] and living I'm going to Gentiles now
[1:37:21] praise the Lord
[1:37:23] God turned to Gentile and this Gentile
[1:37:28] dispensing dispensation is going to
[1:37:32] finish complete and now God is turning
[1:37:36] back to juice again from natural to
[1:37:41] spiritual and to spiritual to the
[1:37:43] natural again this gospel came from east
[1:37:46] and going back to east again so precious
[1:37:49] brothers and sisters here there's a
[1:37:52] greater priesthood than Aaronic and it
[1:37:56] says here in your ninth verse chapter 7
[1:38:00] and verse 9 and as I may so say Levi
[1:38:04] also who receiveth ties paid tithes in
[1:38:08] Abraham for he was yet in the loins of
[1:38:11] his father when Melchizedek met him so
[1:38:17] fourth-generation huh Levi wasn't born
[1:38:22] yet but he was in Abraham's loins but
[1:38:26] met Abraham met milk acidic Leroy also
[1:38:31] paid tithes with his great-grandfather
[1:38:35] to Melchizedek even though he is going
[1:38:40] to be in the future is going to be a
[1:38:42] priest Liva
[1:38:46] even though he was is going to be a
[1:38:48] priest but the priest a natural priest
[1:38:53] was in now Abraham and paid tied to
[1:38:58] Melchizedek that means it's a greater
[1:39:05] priesthood than Aaron priesthood or Levi
[1:39:10] praise the Lord
[1:39:11] so we came from that lineage we didn't
[1:39:16] came from Abraham's natural-like Isaac
[1:39:19] and Jacob and twelve tribes and Lyra and
[1:39:21] our Judah no no but we came to Christ
[1:39:25] but this is the scriptural proof
[1:39:29] evidence to every Christian message
[1:39:33] believer hallelujah that is our rights
[1:39:40] claiming our rights now we have right to
[1:39:44] say by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:39:48] I am the priest and the King what King
[1:39:54] does
[1:39:55] he has Authority so that's why Jesus
[1:39:59] said speak to this mountain Lazar come
[1:40:05] out it's proving that how an authority
[1:40:10] by my word like how brother Branham
[1:40:13] described he said you know traffic
[1:40:15] policy say he stands in the row I mean
[1:40:18] in the center of the you know that what
[1:40:20] you call that
[1:40:21] you know Inter's an intersection and he
[1:40:25] he he just say like the hurt and big
[1:40:29] truck will stop there he don't have a
[1:40:30] strength or power or ability to stop the
[1:40:34] track no no no but the power no
[1:40:38] authority the same thing the Kings Jesus
[1:40:42] Christ is the king of kings so that's
[1:40:45] why he stood up why are you bothered
[1:40:48] what are you what for what your what
[1:40:51] what's happening here how long I will be
[1:40:54] with you
[1:40:55] Oh master o Lord we are going to sink in
[1:40:58] this scene Galilee or we are going to
[1:41:00] die Oh master he just stood up and said
[1:41:04] become Alleluia just and they said who
[1:41:11] who is this man is not a man something
[1:41:15] inside of him the king is the ruler of
[1:41:19] this universe and he made you and me to
[1:41:23] be a ruler a ruler
[1:41:26] he gave us an authority on cancer he
[1:41:29] gave us an authority on and and our
[1:41:31] heart disease he gave us an authority on
[1:41:34] blood pressure
[1:41:35] he gave us an authority on all sickness
[1:41:37] and disease and afflictions he gave us
[1:41:40] an authority because he became he-man us
[1:41:44] a prince and priests please to come into
[1:41:50] the presence of God praise the Lord
[1:41:53] hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah my
[1:41:57] brothers and sisters in the number 17
[1:41:59] chapter
[1:42:01] so every rod was written the name was
[1:42:08] written on on the rods but when it came
[1:42:11] to Aaron's rod Levi's rod I I said it
[1:42:16] says Bible says Levi's rod when it
[1:42:18] brought into the presence the Levi's rod
[1:42:21] God said right Aaron's name on that rod
[1:42:25] not bone food Lima just put Aaron
[1:42:30] hallelujah even though we were not
[1:42:36] belongs to him I mean naturally we were
[1:42:43] messed up we bypassed our t off when he
[1:42:45] came into this world speaking lies and
[1:42:48] you know born in sin and you know and
[1:42:50] came to this this this life in in in a
[1:42:54] in a you know ya worldly way but God had
[1:43:00] chosen you and me before the foundation
[1:43:03] of the world the lamb was slain before
[1:43:06] the foundation of the world before you
[1:43:08] were born before I was born before we
[1:43:10] were born he already paid a price in
[1:43:13] advance powerful he paid a price before
[1:43:20] the foundation of the world and he put a
[1:43:22] name
[1:43:24] no even the Hebrew scholars could never
[1:43:28] pronounce that name a name above all
[1:43:33] names it's not a name of Aaron it's not
[1:43:37] name of the fathers of their household
[1:43:39] is not the name of their princess it's
[1:43:43] not the name of the denomination it's
[1:43:45] not the name of their country it's not
[1:43:47] the name of their genealogy the big
[1:43:49] patriarch law it's the name of God
[1:43:54] hallelujah
[1:43:57] specifically God put the name of Aaron's
[1:44:00] on Levites rod hallelujah he didn't put
[1:44:05] the Levi's the same way we came out from
[1:44:10] that Tree of Life
[1:44:16] when the Tree of Life was you know the
[1:44:19] branch was cut off so that's why Jesus
[1:44:22] said I am the wine and ye are the
[1:44:25] branches so that means the wine is that
[1:44:30] wine the tree is the Tree of Life their
[1:44:33] Lord Jesus Christ and when we were
[1:44:35] separated how we were separated by sin
[1:44:38] unbelief the sin and he belief separated
[1:44:43] from God separated you and me separated
[1:44:46] us from God and we will cut off and
[1:44:50] separated from God and we become you

[1:47:22] birthright he got from his your father
[1:47:24] and that never satisfied him but inside
[1:47:28] of the inside God is dealing with his

[1:50:41] father your all this but you're not but
[1:50:44] he was a dry stick and God Himself came
[1:50:48] down and he asked the name and when he
[1:50:51] confessed then he rubbed or scratched or
[1:50:55] delete or erased that name which is
[1:50:59] Jacob and in the presence of Shekinah
[1:51:06] glory he's writing the name now you will
[1:51:10] be no more called Jacob now you will be
[1:51:13] called
[1:51:15] Prince Prince what is Prince King in the
[1:51:22] presence of Shekinah glory in the
[1:51:26] presence of Shekinah glory he brought us
[1:51:28] out from the darkness brother
[1:51:31] he brought us we never dreamed we're
[1:51:37] never expected we never thought about
[1:51:39] that we never asked for that
[1:51:42] helpless we don't know what time you
[1:51:45] born here we don't know what time we are
[1:51:47] going to die I mean passed away we don't
[1:51:50] know what next hour is going to happen
[1:51:52] helpless but God knows he took out he
[1:51:59] erased or deleted or rubbed or scratched
[1:52:02] that old name varam said the old nature
[1:52:07] old character all life scratched and put
[1:52:15] his name he said Prince now you will be
[1:52:21] called Israel which means Prince Prince
[1:52:25] means son of the king the drive stick
[1:52:36] bloomed blossom got loose and when he
[1:52:45] was went to to the to that place and he
[1:52:49] was walking like fancy you know like a
[1:52:51] model like a movie actor or some kind of
[1:52:53] some kind of stylish you know but when
[1:52:56] he met God
[1:52:57] something happened became humble becomes
[1:53:05] simple hey yesterday you were lying
[1:53:09] right but today
[1:53:12] something happened brother branham said
[1:53:15] when you meet God it changes everything
[1:53:19] changes everything changes the nature
[1:53:22] changes the character changes the
[1:53:24] attitude changes the behavior changes to
[1:53:26] your heart changes your life everything
[1:53:28] because the transformation power is in
[1:53:31] the Lord Jesus Christ when he comes not
[1:53:35] only going you know just coming in the
[1:53:38] church like sitting in like a kitchen no
[1:53:41] just like her in a sanctuary in a living
[1:53:44] room fellowship no just entering into
[1:53:47] the fellowship enter into the fellowship
[1:53:50] enter which means it's not like coming
[1:53:53] to the altar coming in on to the pulpit
[1:53:55] but spiritually speaking let him come to
[1:53:58] you and let us go into him say so that's
[1:54:05] the reason prophet of God said you are
[1:54:08] not only engaged to Christ you are
[1:54:10] married to Christ and bringing forth the
[1:54:13] children bringing forth the fruit fruit
[1:54:18] and the fruit the life is not in the
[1:54:21] church it's in the man the husband the
[1:54:26] husband gives you the life then how come
[1:54:30] if you are as been there and if you here
[1:54:33] you are naturally you all know that we
[1:54:35] can't do any good no children nothing
[1:54:37] but when they go into the bedroom I mean
[1:54:40] spiritually speaking but you know
[1:54:43] something happens hallelujah
[1:54:47] router quote justification
[1:54:50] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:54:53] holy spirit inside of the inside body no
[1:55:01] in chronicles seventh chapter verse 14
[1:55:05] it says I will put my name there forever
[1:55:09] his name forever if he would have if he
[1:55:13] put his name on this flesh on the brains
[1:55:17] it won't be forever maybe if you put
[1:55:20] here it will be for 70 or 80 or 100
[1:55:24] years then his closest is gone but is
[1:55:28] going from body spirit and the soul
[1:55:33] inside of the heart is putting his name
[1:55:37] there forever
[1:55:39] missus Jesus Christ I hope you're
[1:55:43] catching mine so I don't want to you
[1:55:46] know go more theory it is almost 5 to 9
[1:55:49] so my precious brothers and sisters I
[1:55:52] have a quotes here but you know can I
[1:55:58] read one quote yeah so so here brother
[1:56:04] branham in the message called the
[1:56:07] greater than Solomon is here 1963 he
[1:56:10] preached he said when Solomon prayed he
[1:56:13] prayed Lord if thy people anywhere be in
[1:56:16] trouble and look towards his holy
[1:56:18] mountain or this holy place and pray
[1:56:21] then hear from heaven and Jonah had
[1:56:24] confidence that God heard the prayer of
[1:56:27] Solomon because he was a servant of God
[1:56:29] and if we could have that much faith
[1:56:32] upon the prayer of a man that was
[1:56:35] dedicating an earthly temple and a man
[1:56:39] praying the prayer that family in his
[1:56:42] life back slate and under them
[1:56:45] circumstances with them kind of symptoms
[1:56:47] could have that much confidence that God
[1:56:50] would hear his prayer how much more out
[1:56:54] we today was sitting in the presence of
[1:56:57] the resurrected Jesus Christ look away
[1:57:01] from our symptoms to the heaven itself
[1:57:05] where Jesus sits at the right hand of
[1:57:07] God with his own blood to make
[1:57:10] intercessors upon our confession upon
[1:57:15] our confession Jacob Israel
[1:57:18] I believe that is presence here now to
[1:57:22] set me free from any bondage that Satan
[1:57:26] put upon me and I look to where he sits
[1:57:30] at the right hand of God ever living to
[1:57:32] make intercession to me with his own
[1:57:35] blood as a high priest he sits there and
[1:57:41] how much more out.we to look to the holy
[1:57:45] place of God with Jesus himself our
[1:57:49] mediator the only one between God and
[1:57:52] man stands with his own blood to make
[1:57:55] intercession on other confessions a man
[1:57:58] a man me so be it
[1:58:00] I believe it it with all my heart
[1:58:03] praise His Holy Name saints of God in
[1:58:07] the presence of Shekinah glory we are
[1:58:11] plumed we are presumed prophet said is
[1:58:17] not the wine bringeth forth fruit but
[1:58:21] the branches so he said I am the wine he
[1:58:26] are the branches
[1:58:28] The Tree of Life we came from him and
[1:58:31] again we are going back to him so that's
[1:58:36] why he said I leave so ye shall be also
[1:58:39] and also he said now you are coming into
[1:58:44] that union and also the prophet of God
[1:58:47] said in this crisis the mystery of God
[1:58:50] revealed I read many times their
[1:58:51] scriptures st. John 14 20 but brother
[1:58:54] Branham how the revelation came he said
[1:58:57] it that day he shall know that I am in
[1:59:00] my father oneness is speaking about the
[1:59:02] unity or the oneness I am in my father
[1:59:06] and father in me and I he said now
[1:59:09] brother Branham said now it's I in you
[1:59:13] you in me he shall know ha wonderful
[1:59:20] praise the name of the Lord don't you
[1:59:23] love him for that don't you love him for
[1:59:26] what he has done for us don't you love
[1:59:29] him for what he's doing right now in the
[1:59:31] present-day don't you love him for what
[1:59:33] is going to do for us in the future we
[1:59:36] love him with all our heart thank you
[1:59:38] Lord Jesus praise His Holy Name
[1:59:41] praise the Lord I turned the service to
[1:59:44] the man of God praise His Holy Name
[1:59:47] hallelujah
[2:00:09] amen
[2:00:11] I mean enjoyed the word of the Lord
[2:00:13] tonight amen what what grace what grace
[2:00:19] is given to us amen and how God will how
[2:00:23] God works within a life and it's truly
[2:00:26] it's truly a process and whatever God
[2:00:29] starts he will finish it he will finish
[2:00:33] it and you know it's just the reality is
[2:00:36] let him finish let him do what what he
[2:00:40] began amen just that we were just
[2:00:42] talking the other night and we were just
[2:00:44] you know the the the illustration that
[2:00:47] brother branham used so many times when
[2:00:49] he would deal with that of God taking a
[2:00:53] hold of a life and he would liken that
[2:00:55] to a cup that the Lord would pick up
[2:00:58] that cup that would be maybe in a
[2:01:00] chicken yard or somewhere and the cup is
[2:01:02] so filthy
[2:01:04] when he picks it up when you pick it up
[2:01:07] you still has all the filth as soon as
[2:01:09] all the desires about it that's the
[2:01:11] Brotherhood that's what the Lord was
[2:01:13] bringing out tonight
[2:01:14] that's justification amen a person
[2:01:17] believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God's
[2:01:20] dealing their heart it's the same Holy
[2:01:22] Spirit dealing with the life but it's
[2:01:26] the call is not just to be a dirty cop
[2:01:30] but it's that now the one who picked it
[2:01:33] up is the one who will clean it up and
[2:01:37] he cleans that cup up the cup doesn't
[2:01:40] clean itself he cleans it sanctification
[2:01:44] is the process of the person of Jesus
[2:01:49] Christ him working in our life for the
[2:01:52] ultimate purpose why did he pick me up
[2:01:55] in the beginning because he wanted to
[2:01:57] use me he wanted to fill me up with his
[2:02:02] own life and there's not one of us in
[2:02:04] here that would drink out of a dirty cup
[2:02:06] nobody would I don't believe anybody
[2:02:08] would you drink only out of a clean cup
[2:02:12] you know how it is sometimes you get out
[2:02:14] of the you get out of the cabinet you
[2:02:16] can take a cup out of there and you can
[2:02:19] look at it sometimes you might see
[2:02:21] something in oh the dishwasher didn't
[2:02:23] get this one so you put it in the sink
[2:02:25] and maybe you'll scrub it a little bit
[2:02:28] because the dishwasher didn't get it
[2:02:29] you'd get it clean why do you do it cuz
[2:02:32] you're not gonna drink out of it and God
[2:02:35] Himself when he reaches down and picks
[2:02:38] up that life by his presence he then
[2:02:42] cleanses it he cleans it of every habit
[2:02:46] everything of the world he cleans it and
[2:02:49] then he comes inside of it to dwell
[2:02:53] that's why the scripture says we are his
[2:02:56] workmanship amen we were not our own
[2:03:00] work we are his signature addition a man
[2:03:06] or work of the master himself amen so
[2:03:09] here tonight we're gonna witness in you
[2:03:12] know of a baptism here tonight where God
[2:03:14] has taken a hold of a heart that is
[2:03:16] surrendered to him brother Trevor as
[2:03:17] they go ahead and make their way he he
[2:03:20] surrendered his heart to the Lord and
[2:03:22] God just working in his life God has a
[2:03:24] full purpose just like he has within
[2:03:26] every every one of our lives amen
[2:03:29] so we're just thankful to God for that
[2:03:31] we are walking in as our brother walks
[2:03:34] into the water of baptism tonight he is
[2:03:36] identifying a man with the death
[2:03:40] in the burial and the resurrection of
[2:03:43] the Lord Jesus Christ amen with the
[2:03:45] promise that if we repent and be
[2:03:48] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[2:03:50] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:54] anybody ever worked for a birthday gift
[2:03:57] if you did it wasn't a gift somebody
[2:04:00] tricked you but if it's a birthday gift
[2:04:03] it's got your name on it and it's a gift
[2:04:06] you didn't earn it you didn't merit it
[2:04:08] and that's the way that the Holy Ghost
[2:04:10] is you can't earn it
[2:04:12] you can't merit it you can't be good
[2:04:14] enough it is sovereignly given with our
[2:04:18] name on it
[2:04:19] amen so we just are so thankful to the
[2:04:23] Lord tonight for for brother Trevor and
[2:04:25] the stand that that he's taken here
[2:04:29] god bless Chevy each and every one of
[2:04:31] you this my son-in-law Trevor Warren and
[2:04:36] which is so thankful for the Lord that
[2:04:39] God is doing in his life I could say one
[2:04:42] thing that I had nothing to do with it
[2:04:45] this is a hole of one could call this
[2:04:49] way the scripture says over in the book
[2:04:51] of Acts talks about that everyone the
[2:04:56] God is the ordained to eternal life
[2:04:59] those are the people added to the church
[2:05:03] I'm so thankful that it's not a work of
[2:05:05] man because if it was the work of man
[2:05:08] would probably have all the pews all
[2:05:10] fall over the year but there's a little
[2:05:13] thankful that God is the one doing the
[2:05:14] work and he gets the glory he gets all
[2:05:18] the honor and all the credit belongs to
[2:05:21] him we're just just instruments of God
