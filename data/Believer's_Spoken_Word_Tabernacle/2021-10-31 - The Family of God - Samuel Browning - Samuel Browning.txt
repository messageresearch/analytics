kim also to come up here with brother samuel we've got to present a gift to them everyone knows october is pastor appreciation month and we just want to present something to them i'd like to read a little scripture here first if that's okay in luke 10 30 it says jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead by chance they there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise at levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed on by the other side but a certain samaritan his journey came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and he went down and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own breast beast and brought him in into the inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave him to the host and he said unto him take care of him and whatsoever whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee and many times i read over that that parable and i always just noticed the samaritan and we know the samaritan is jesus our savior you know he's the one that picked us up but i'm just grateful to know that he didn't just pick me up dust me off and just give me his holy spirit and his wine his revelation of who he was he didn't just leave me on the road and just leave me there he was jehovah gyra and he took him to a caregiver took the man to a caregiver to take care of him until he was strong enough until he was strong enough to go on his way to on his journey and brother branham said you know jesus found a man at one time in a parable on the road to jericho from jerusalem it showed that he was backsliding he was going from up on high going down low he was backsliding he he met him on the road an enemy had beaten him robbed him and left him dead and physically alive spiritually dead so on the priests and the levites and so forth passed by him but the good samaritan as jesus taught him taught it came picked him up poured oil and wine and take him to the end now there now there's the place i want to get to you he taken him to the end and said to the caretaker take care of him give him he gave him a couple pennies or whatever it was to pay his way and said now if he needs any more just go ahead and take care of him i'll make it right when i come now you shepherds god gave you the spirit and the word to take care of these wounded ones that's been brought in if you need any more he'll take care of when he comes just so feed my sheep and i believe god has given me a caretaker like brother samuel [Applause] and i just look back at my life you know just um when i first gave my heart to the lord i was just thinking and um you know brother samuel didn't really know me but he knew i loved to play basketball you know he knew i played in college and when i first came to the youth meetings uh he he took it upon himself to read about basketball in the newspaper just so he would be able to converse with me have that relationship with me first he's he's done many things i've had many phone calls with him many times i remember sister kim i could hear bringing him uh and food because he missed dinner that night you know with his family he's made countless sacrifice uh sacrifices for me and i'm sure he's made many sacrifices for you all and i just want to thank god for our pastor and his um godly wife that supports him you know she does many things behind the scenes she's prayed for me i'm sure countless times and all of us youth and we just want to say thank you brother samuel and we gave you um one night stay at a um in amish country and uh and a gift card to a restaurant that ate last night so it's pretty good and uh and a gift card to starbucks where i emailed you all the directions that you guys need and we just want to say we love you and we appreciate you and thank you and god bless you [Applause] thank you i'm not on yet okay well i just want to say thank you and i i to me it's just a it just was when the lord got a hold of my life it was the greatest thing that he ever did for me i didn't ask for anything more i was happy with just setting setting and just worshiping i most of you knew that when god first got a hold of my life i just enjoyed i just enjoyed serving the lord and uh but god god had other other plans for other things to be done and to me it's whatever he asked me to do it's an honor i i owe him my whole life and it's just a real honor to i tell you i'm just being honest with you i love pastoring and i love you i love you and there you know there's times that we as a we're we're a family and i think about that many times in in our in my own family there's a lot of it that i can really understand even more when brother banham as he goes into the scriptures and we see many of the qualifications that are set forth for a pastor and one of those things is also with a family and to see that it's very that that in itself becomes very evident because there's a lot of things and i can tell you it hasn't stopped learning you see it more and more and more and the one thing i just asked god for is lord help me to be more of a servant i want to be more of a servant because the desire within every of all my heart is i want to see every one of you on the other side that's i want to spend eternity with you because it's it's just it's wonderful walking here in this life together it's just awesome to see the word of god just coming there's no greater joy in my heart than to see the people of god just just electrified by the word of god and their lives just just just taking on that word and just becoming that word just to see christ himself being revealed in your life there's no greater joy that i have than to see that that right there and i'm just so thankful that god's brought us together i'm glad for the grace of god and god knows how our paths are to cross and and you know this very well as as well as i do as you know within it we sometimes there's things that we can look sometimes at one another we don't understand things altogether but we trust we trust the lord and sometimes we disappoint one another but that's because but within all of that we still come to that place to say lord i am trusting in you lord jesus and i'm so grateful for that aren't you amen i'm grateful for the grace of god that right here among us and i just want to say thank you for brother brian for those kind words and i know that that's you know on behalf of the whole congregation and i just asked you to continue to pray for me and may god continue to help me to be a faithful innkeeper amen i we have a presentation here brother shane will go ahead and come and that's where i thought brother brian i thought wow some brother brian already knows that there's brother shane's got a presentation here as a trustees to present this i thought wow this is he's already told me brother samuel i'm going to get you out a few minutes early but uh we brother shane's going to just give a presentation here in just a moment it's just some work that lord willing a project that we're wanting to move into here um on behalf the trustees and with the for the congregation i believe it's something you really um you really look uh really be thankful for so you've got you're ready to go okay hello all right god bless you church tough to follow that wow um but yeah uh brother richie brother aaron and myself have uh some exciting news a project to share with you uh i've simplified it with pictures and dimensions so you can understand it best if you do have any questions you can see me or the other trustees at the fellowship or call us email us whatever works best so so the project is going to consist of five phases uh phase one will be the northwest side including the playground walkway which will start this year that is actually where brother samuel parks so maybe we can consider that a part of the pastor a new appreciation pad but uh phase two will be the front walkway that'll consist of all the way down from this point all the way down to where he parks which will start lord willing in spring of 2022 phase three will be the entrance ramp which is now wood which i'll explain that uh which will start in spring summer of 2020 phase four will be a new front porch uh again you know probably more summer 2022 phase five will be a metal roof extension covering the front porch and also the entrance ram so phase one where brother samuel parks right now is an existing 16 by 29 foot concrete pad if you've ever gone back there you can kind of see here it's it's kind of a hazard right now for the children it's all broken up i know i think there were some questions insurance had about it but anyway so right now will be a new pad and again these steps consist of taking all this out it's not just like oh you can dump concrete done deal so there's you know a lot of steps to this but uh and also where this kind of wood guide path will be a four foot wide concrete 36 feet long coming to the playground so that will take place this year phase two will be uh right now i think this is ten foot this will be reduced because later i'll get on to the front porch being extended but it will be a five foot concrete walkway and like i said it will go from this corner of the church all the way down to the corner five feet wide and then uh with the concrete the uh handicap ramp um and again these these steps consist of breaking all this up cutting it all out removing it so it's a it's a pretty in-depth process phase three will be the new concrete ramp which i'll just show you the pictures of this these are the styles that we're we're thinking of here this is not a concrete example but so this type of railing with this this be pretty close to this as far as the concrete ramp so it will be four feet wide where the wood is now and it'll be 27 feet long and i'll show you this picture again and there will be this is just a close-up of the style of the railing that will go down the ramp here so phase three will be the new front porch uh this will come out 10 feet and it'll be 14 foot long and there will be steps on the left and the right side the reason why we couldn't do it in the front is probably because a car will park here so you know can't nobody will be able to get in but so we steps here to the left and to the right picture of that this is kind of an example but again you have to ignore the front steps these will be on this side so on the left and right side would be the walkway this is another example this is a small version again this art will not be this small but just so you can kind of picture it just get the image and these will be the steps that will come up from the left and the right side of the ramp so phase four will be the overhang to cover the new concrete ramp it's a 12 inch overhang the style will match as close as we can to the style of the roof the metal roof that is on it this is kind of a if you ever go to fast food they kind of have these overhangs obviously it'll be much it'll be 12 inches and it'll match the current as close as we can to the to move and this is uh so the so you can see kind of here the steps on the left and the right side and then the roof will come all the way out you know so there won't be you know we won't get rained on once you hit the front porch and they're snowing on and also the ramp here so so yeah that's the slides uh let me go back here to the timeline we do plan on taking special offerings the second sunday of every month starting in november and again you know if there's any questions uh feel free to see me brother richard brother aaron and we'd love to to chat and yeah this is exciting you know to refresh the church and just like we do our homes you know and to make it look beautiful so god bless you [Applause] i guess i think that's a problem can agree that that's something that is very important you know one thing that that's made this that's me i didn't want to be over there clearing my throat and brother shane was talking but you know i just always i i just i believe we look at things like this i i look at the house of god and i look at it as a reflection of what we even think about the lord jesus and i that's why you know i i look at things and i'd rather do something i wanted to you want it to look nice you want it to look presentable because nothing that we could ever do could ever compare to him but i believe that everything that we can do it speaks a lot of what we think of the lord jesus amen and i just believe in doing that and so we the brothers brother richie's one of the drawings there you've seen and brother richie put together so many drawings brother richie can i tell you the drawings that he came up with he handed me a handed all of us a whole folder back in june and the drawings that brother richie has done it it might seem a little hard to see but you know out there on that pad i never really even thought about it until one time i think brother carlos brought it to my attention and that because brother carlos and i won't call the brother's name that he lost off of the top of the porch out there in the wheelchair because there's no turn there's no place to turn around when they come out with a wheelchair or something and you know how it is out there right now you have to watch and be careful who's understanding out there so um just as the lord has provided that we were able to have a four year where you know we can come out and you know be able to greet one another and i think that's exactly how that'll be there so you won't have to worry about with room and being able to turn around and having a roof over that as well as the the ramp because we've needed we've needed the ramp and some of the things out there and i'll just say it this way some of the things that we've had out there has just been temporary fixes and sometimes temporary turns in one year to a year three year and you know everyone's there's a lot of a busyness and a lot of things that goes on and we're just like anybody else all of us are we have to really try to get things honed in and plan things out and talk about it but i think the brothers have done just a wonderful job and brother shane when we were looking at that the other night on across a group meeting a call across the internet with the brothers and my i just told him i said well i know i'm going to have to make my powerpoints from now on but he just did just just a wonderful job with that i know brother aaron sister man that they weren't able to be here today just some circumstances there and uh i just asked that uh you know there's a lot that even with the brother aaron that has some of that background and some of the things with the concrete so there's a lot that will the brothers will continue to keep you up to date on all of those things that are taking place and throughout so we love the lord and i want to just remind you if you want to change positions and just stand with me here just for a few moments and we'll just read the word of the lord and we'll go to prayer durian remind you this after the service here we have the fellowship dinner the the at the presbyterian church the address is on the board uh in the announcements in the restroom also uh next next sunday uh brother alexander mcgoulas will be here next sunday the lord willing i have to i'll be in washington d.c not the white house but i'll be in washington d.c with brother mike walls and so just ask you just just keep us in prayer for that also brother brother wayne lawson will be here on november 13th and 14th that's a saturday and a sunday and you've we've known about that since i don't know i think i started putting that on the announcements back in july so you could prepare for because i know i know different ones that you have to try to everybody has to try to organize the schedules and and as much as we don't like schedules but we got to schedule things in i mean it's just just no way around it i find myself at home myself a note uh check in on insurance and just put a note pop up on this certain time because if not out of sight out of mind amen god bless you sister lily's mom good to have you here with us amen god bless you amen amen if there's somebody else i've missed uh i forgive me but let's look here into the word of the lord this morning uh deuteronomy chapter 16. deuteronomy 16 and verse 1. maybe as you hold your place there let's just let's go to him in a word of prayer i just like to approach him before we read this heavenly father lord jesus what up what a beautiful day you've given us lord what a lord lord of wonderful time oh god and a privilege to be able to come into your presence this morning lord father we're standing here lord we need you lord jesus and father for every need for every situation and or perhaps there's things that lord that we would not even maybe be aware of or it's there in our conscience mind right now but you know the need lord and we just ask that father that you would just speak very personally to our hearts help me to step aside lord because as a man lord i i can do nothing lord but father just as i heard your prophet say and you know that just resonated in my heart this morning just a few words from him and lord that's all we need is just a few words from you lord so may you come lord you're the author you're the quickener you're the life of the word may you come lord i pray and just breathe upon us this morning oh god take your word lord and just speak to us in a personal way drive back doubt and darkness lord complexes unbelief sin o god may you just move lord i pray that god any whole lord whether it be sickness whether it be sin whatever lord it might be it is all met in you lord may you just come lord very personally here this morning lord and just speak to our hearts we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen deuteronomy 16 and verse 1 observe the month of abel and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there thou shalt eat no leavened bread with him seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest observe mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days neither shall there anything of the flesh which thou sacrifices the first day of even remain all night unto the morning thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover and even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt and thou shalt roast it and eat it in the place which the lord thy god shall choose thou shalt turn in the morning and go on to thy tents six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the lord thy god thou shalt do no work therein amen i'd like to just speak to you or at least start into it on the family of god may god bless you bless the reading of the words you're being seated when we we draw from the scriptures here we we can clearly see there's only one place that god will recognize and receive worship and that's in his chosen place so it's god's choosing and where god makes known his choice and i want you to remember in the scriptures we've you've seen the parallel down through the scriptures because it is within mankind to worship is driven to worship remember brother branham would talk about even how things certain things were and he went and he was talking about in places where he had been in africa and certain things they were worshiping and you you find that that worship itself there's always been that of a parallel and there's been uh you know a person that even can say well i'm not religious but they're still a worshiper you know you can worship your job you could worship your husband you could worship your you you could just worship your career yes and yet what it is is that's a there's a there's a desire to worship and there's there's only god placed that desire within you to worship that desire is there and there there is a place where you are able to really worship and worship the living god and so when we see it's like cane when you look at cain think of how that cain when he when he brought his his his sacrifice here abel brings his cain brings his the difference between them is that we find that cain is bringing fruit of the field and he wasn't slack he wasn't you know he wasn't just lazy about he brought the best fruits but abel what he brought was what god had revealed to him and abel was walking by that revelation and they come into that place of worship and so what abel had had received from god as a revelation god himself came and vindicated that revelation that that came from him you see god will always confirm his word god does not leave it up to a church or a person to confirm the word as a matter of fact even for your life or my life god does not leave it in our hands to confirm or to prove that we are christians but it is god himself who comes down in the life of a believer and it's god's own life moving through us that declares us to be a christian so this is why it's more than anything that we could ever say out of our mouth it's what comes out of our life that actually is a declaration because as we look for months you have a voice it's god's voice when the holy ghost has come it's a voice of god that sounds out through our life to others that i'm a christian i'm a believer and it's in everything that we do and we say so we come back to here and we look at cain and we look at we see abel and remember paul would pick this up because when cain came to worship when god you know god dealt with cain about uh you know when cain's countenance was fallen and and he asked cain why why is your countenance falling now it may not have been anything out here but it was a countenance within to where here it was just fallen within but you see the word is a discerner and he knew his countenance was fallen and he finally begins to point cain to a place he says if thou if thou doest well shalt thou also be accepted and he says if thou doest not then send life at the door so its unbelief so cain himself god god even came down and god pointed out what cain already knew this was the perfect will of god it was vindicated by god himself and cain knew that but cain was not able to come to that depth of humility to surrender his life to them and that's all god asked for us to do is the surrendering of our life and that's the continuum of even our walk as a believer is a continual surrender of our life as paul said i die daily paul picks this up here i believe it's in the book of colossians and he speaks of how you have people then you have individuals that now after the holy ghost has come you have different ones that are you know they're intruding into worship of angels and it's all they're going into this and going into that and and and paul begins to express then he identifies that the things that they're doing is a satisfying of the flesh in other words they are feeling appeased by the things that they're doing even what they would a lot to of this is a supernatural but paul identifies it by the spirit of god he calls it will worship it's not the will of god it's man's will wherein man is willing to worship but not coming according to god's will of worship you see this is where when we come into it cain he offered and he went according to his own understanding and yet after even after what god had revealed and confirmed and this is where jesus would speak to the pharisees or to the religious in that day a scripture you're very familiar with when they themselves were standing there you couldn't put a finger on their life but jesus is identifying and he says in vain you do worship me now i want you to think of this they were worshiping him but in vain they weren't they were not partakers of the effect that god would even release in that hour let me just let me just allow the holy spirit to just take this for a moment you realize you could say we could look and say well the holy ghost had not been given yet that is true as far as an indwelling by the new birth but the holy ghost was already here all the way that's what had been dealing with abraham that's what had been dealing with on the same holy spirit this is the same holy ghost that that david could write take not thy holy spirit from me it's the same spirit of god that all of them through the old testament have relied upon it was the same unction that they received that made a difference when they offered the lamb they weren't just offering in ritual like well we got to go do this and and moses you know yeah moses said we got to offer yeah we got to go up to the feast at this time and and sometimes it wasn't even let me just say it sometimes it wasn't even so much the drudgery of like oh yeah i got to go to the feast and yeah we have to offer this up but sometimes it was simply that it what happened is there was no connection no conviction with the worshiper no sincerity with the offering of their sacrifice and this is why god would say in the book of isaiah who has called you who has caused you to tread my courts and offer up these sacrifices he says and he calls them not his feasts he said your feasts because there was no connection there was no conviction in their life it was no more than ceremonialism it was things they were just going through a routine let me just say this satan does not care how much that a person you could come to church how much a person could know about the message have saint doesn't care about that if you just stay in a ceremonial place that doesn't bother him one bit matter of fact you'll stand right beside you and say let's go let's take on this ceremony let's go to this feast but it's when your life when there you release yourself to the hunger that's on the inside then i want god i want to know more of god i need more of god in my life every one of us have a desire and should have for more of god and we want to see more of himself being revealed and revealed in our own life it's a desire that pulsates in our heart because we don't want to live lives of vanity when we come to the house of god then we walk away empty let me just say this let's just take the heart off the devil right now because satan's desire within it is that we would live vain lives that are empty but god's desire is that we would live lives that are filled with the fullness of god we would live it to the full potential and that's why god speaks to us in a service whether he's calling a heart and a life and surrender to him or he's dealing with others that those of us that are dwelling there behind the veil god is still reminding us that your life the whole of your life don't allow the enemy to encroach on it but give and surrender your all to me let me be the fullness of your life let me be your satisfaction in everything let me be your resource let me be your tower your culvert let me be your rock let me be your shield and god would speak to us in this moment because our lives are to produce i fruit produce this fruit much as i can i can try it i can't do it but he can and see the greatest enemy that we have is our own selves if we can get ourselves out of the way this is where the battle the battle really lays and this is why when jesus said in vain you do worship me teaching for doctrine the commandments of men so they couldn't let me just say this here was the religious people in that hour reading the prophecies they were there going up to the feast in jerusalem but yet they weren't worshiping in the name or in the place where god had revealed his name what you think of that they're going to jerusalem for the feast and when we look at the scripture well god said to go where he placed his name but that's got to be a personal revelation to you you see when it's when it's revealed it brings conviction in your life it brings things that you consider your footsteps you consider your life because why you recognize that the god that we're speaking about isn't a mysticism it's a god who is present he's right here and not out here but a god who's living right here inside behind this veil and you watch your steps you order your steps and you take from the spirit of god that if you start getting out of out of step the spirit of god can speak to your life and call you back in step because you're in tune with his voice and your desire is to please him you see simeon here's simeon here's anna uh you know even simon's father they they were moved upon by the spirit of god i want you to think simeon right down in the temple what was the difference between simeon and the rest of them the holy spirit the bible says the spirit of god revealed to him amen that he should not die until he would see the lord's christ simeon was in such you see this wasn't something if i could say it in this way something of a fly by night but simeon himself was already moved by the spirit of god but it came for a junction there and notice simeon's life was not a vain life i'm just going to follow him right now when the enemy let me just say this for each and every one of us in here there are times that you can look at and just focus in right now on what he's saying there's times that you can look in your life and things seem so overwhelming to your life and you begin to look and say well it seems like things are in vain it seems like my prayers aren't being answered it seems like this is taking place let me say this to you just because god hasn't answered the prayer the way you wanted it does not mean that he has an answer and because he hasn't come through and turned the situation around doesn't mean that he doesn't love you doesn't mean that he doesn't care doesn't mean that your life is in vain you stand as a believer on the word because part of the fruit of the believer is patience and patience possess ye your souls and patience says god has said it i'm gonna stand right here ain't the devil gonna move me off of this promise this is my promise no matter what comes i'm gonna stand there you say what's taking place it's manifesting that's not a vain life that's a lie where the fruit of almighty god is issuing out of your life in situations like that hey it's not hard and hard to have patience when you don't need them i mean when you're the next guy up in line and man everything's going just right you know mcdonald's is really following the fast food mar you know man it's not hard but see patience is where when we're tried sometimes is that right we're situations sometimes where it seemed like the doctor didn't get this or this or that and things aren't going and what do i do stand still in that time just stand still and say god down god alone you're above every situation you know what's taking place i might seem like my world is upside down but on the inside there's an anchor there's a hole on the inside it's not a vain life rebuke that devil in the name of jesus christ and just put him under your foot that's where he's at already just put him under your foot oh my because a vain life is a life where remember the pharisees there was nothing but ceremonialism but for a real life of a believer oh it's not a ceremony we love him amen oh brother samuel do we fail yeah we fail but but his grace is sufficient he gives us strength even to rise back up and even when we're a struggle there that's moving on and our feelings are this way or our feelings are this way but down on the inside there is something greater than a feeling it is the word of the living god that's down on the inside our lives are not lived in vain hallelujah this is where jesus you know remember he would speak when he's speaking about where when he come to the woman of the well we were looking at that a little bit last week how you had a person that had such a a thirst and a desire and satan likes to try to pervert true desires that's good right that's what he tries to do because just as you know when brother braham covers that in 65 and the message stirs to me friends listen this message that god has sent this isn't building up a man this is god [Music] i mean if you can really take it and take that word and feed on it it loosens it dismisses and dismantles the whole of the enemy because we're not reading listen to me we're not reading or preaching this bible through a school of theology i know we get accused of following a man but let's just bring this to the table right now we get accused of following a man but where is it at where all of a sudden you can go to them and say well a woman shouldn't cut her hair or god still sends prophets and you start going in the scriptures with them and they'll say well you know what you know that the council said god that no longer applies so who's following a man you're following the word of a man and the bible said whosoever added or taken away his part will be taken out of the book of life we're not following a man we're following the pillar of fire brother this is not the interpretation of a man this is the interpretation of almighty god and god has stamped himself on this message hallelujah god himself has come down night after night after night and said amen [Applause] and your life is a testimony that this message is not the message of a man because a man can't produce that in your life a man can give you orders a man can give you creeds a man can give you doctrine but a man can never reproduce that life of jesus christ but god himself [Applause] she had a real desire and this is why brother brown would talk about different you know desires this right a desire you know for said young people you know and so forth to be married you know he said to be to have love to be loved he said it's natural for a woman to want to look beautiful right see that god put that there satan didn't i'd love to preach that sometimes god had given me and dealing with that how we look at godly beauty versus satan's beauty [Music] satan does it in a manner to take away from what's real when brother branham points that out under the inspiration it says satan is her designer he's not talking about a real true woman of god he's speaking about how that they have been he has been yielded to the enemy and through perversion things and whether it's been stripped off or other things that's been used and now that's not god's desire but god's design is for a lady to be a real lady as a matter of fact let me tell you something sisters god has chosen you to display the bride of jesus christ he god has chosen even in your life even in your lives to be such a display of his choosing of his pride spiritually that we are all a part of but god has chosen that amen praise god oh blessed be his name amen remember jesus said he said the hour's coming and it now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him this is why the word the lord jesus was standing there at that well of samaria because the father was seeking true worship seems like maybe he would have went down to the temple but he's seeking true worship he ain't looking at what her life is right now amen he's looking beneath what is all the darkness and the mass of confusion all it takes is one moment in his presence and he will dismiss every darkness every doubt every every hole that's been upon her life that has tried to hold her down satan is trying to ruin her life but let's just put the devil on notice you can't destroy a seed of god you can't destroy the word of god there'll not be one word that'll fail i'm talking about you yeah i'm talking about me hallelujah this is why then in our lives think about the little woman that 90 years old was led to the lord and was pointed out in that vision she was 90 years old when you let her to the lord i don't care what kind of diseases came her way i don't care what kind of car accidents i don't care what came her way she might have we don't know her whole background we don't know all the heartaches but we know being 90 years old she made quite a journey we don't know how many times that the devil might have wanted to try to take her life but he couldn't get to her until that uniting had taken place within her life maybe she got hardened with things of life but you see no matter the hardening of things of life in the presence of almighty god and god begins to move on that heart you're not experiencing an angry god you're experiencing the tenderness and the mercy of a loving god that's there to set you free my my my mind god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and that woman when she said i know that messiah cometh and when he has come he'll tell us all these things i that speak to thee and he so this manifestation and i want to speak about that because this where i chose to place my name hallelujah now think of that god had many titles god would reveal himself and men under many different titles and and you know even how solomon would write by inspiration those were titles of how god had manifested himself to solomon this wasn't solomon just saying let me see let me get some good words here let me see if i can just write a song now and rhyme this to rhyme that no no no no this was inspiration this was personal he's the lily of the valley amen we're talking about personal these are experiences of who he has become to them aren't you glad that you can say he is redeemer he is my deliverer he is my savior those are all titles but those are titles attributes that he has manifested himself to you different titles jehovah jireh we see there in genesis 22 jehovah jehovah shalom there with gideon and i wanted to say it in this way because here in his name when he says i will choose to place my name there then it will be a manifestation of his name and that manifestation of his name is the revealing of his word by his presence in other words let me just say the very spirit of god every time that he comes he comes with a purpose for every visitation through the scripture to fulfill the promise that he the spirit of god has made for a certain time for a certain group of people the holy spirit does not come in a service just to make us feel good the holy ghost in this hour has not come in a manner just to you know to boy i tell you what what a blessing it's it's a there's a purpose that god has come because remember without the holy ghost this is the mechanics without the dynamics of the holy ghost it'll stay right there but it takes the dynamics the breath of god to come upon that word and begin to breathe upon that word and as god is breathing on that word that's the same god that through that word being spoken under divine inspiration it is god declaring this is the hour this is the season and there is word in every life and the breath of god is the one that breathes upon our life to draw us from the world to inspire that word to our lives god comes for a visitation many have missed his visitation down through the time you know ben you know how to well you know i i i felt the holy spirit but god come for our purpose just like when he came to visit before before uh abraham's tent door it was for a purpose when god came to abram and spoke to him when he was there in the in the earth calde he came because there's a purpose yes that purpose wasn't all fulfilled nor was it all unfolded at that moment but it was the holy spirit that came to bring about and move us into the purpose of almighty god see this is where when jesus would say it like this in luke 21 verse 8 he said take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go you not therefore after them now he's announcing right there because remember be even before uh god became flesh remember there were those who rose up beforehand and leading people off in the desert right the scriptures did show us that and that's satan all while the reason satan's doing that is to try to dilute and take away from the promise of the word because he knows he can't defeat that word he knows he can't stop that word so what he tries to do is build unbelief in that word amen let me just let's just bring it on down home i don't care how close it could have been let's bring it back to the days of the lord jesus before he ever walked here on earth there might have been some that their families went on out in the desert and they drank that kool-aid are you with me they might have had your mom and dad had the kool-aid stains all over their mouth and everything else if i'm the christ and following all this and so forth but there was there might have been young people that was sitting there and saying man alive i can't believe this i don't want nothing to do with this i don't want anything to do with that but yet down on the inside even though this could be said here you can't get away from what the word that god has already placed there within that life and though the darkness though the hardness though the complexes could be built up it will never stop god from getting one of his children he might have to soften him he might have to break it down but he'll never you'll never stop god from getting one of his children you say brother samuel why would that be said in that way well i believe he just said that to let you know that there's no circumstance greater than the word himself so if you were looking at a child or a loved one or whatever you say my goodness that's a big circumstance but it's not bigger than god [Applause] you can't wall it up high enough you can't make the walls thick enough come on now i'm not talking about your strength i'm talking about the mighty god [Applause] mom so notice he said many will come in my name and they'll say i'm christ and he said the time's drawing near so it was drawing near to where it would be the outpouring of the holy ghost that was going to come now in first john chapter 4 here john would write beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are god notice what is to try the spirits i got dryness there don't want anybody to get you can't sneeze nowadays he's coughing believe it or not they're still sinus infections and i don't have one but i'll tell you what you you tell you i'll tell you a thing i mean how the enemy is so working nowadays with things but you know you've been in stores and other things right now and you hear people sneezing one or more in restaurants and i'm just so glad that you don't see people looking around like and we're saying friends we're not saying that things aren't real right but we're trusting in the lord right because never before when we would come to the house of god or anywhere else did were we concerned or somebody sneezes right well i don't know how we're on this or coffin i don't know how many times i've had i've just cough drops i have a lot of times with culture how many times i've had cough drops just to try to do what just to try so nothing is unsettled with people and so there's nothing let it coat my throat because my wife said since she said since the time i met you you had a cough who beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god now notice these words every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come not did come right right are you hearing me now is present tense come in the flesh is a god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world so satan is his uh approach is in deception and if not for the abiding of the word i'm talking about before the holy ghost even come if not for the abiding of the word we would be swallowed right up in all of those things as well so we can't take any cred boy i studied this and i did this and i did that and i well why didn't you i mean why i mean why why did he have to go to calvary why did he have to send back the holy ghost it ain't what we did let me just tell you something before my dad ever came across this message god the holy spirit began to deal with his heart about things in the scriptures that he was seeing right there in the church of god things that he was seeing that he started to see on water baptism but there wasn't nothing there to confirm that but you see there was things already a hunger that was being stirred up where did that hunger come from to lead him into the scriptures to begin to say my i'm seeing this and tracing this over here and tracing this over here but you know how my dad i i didn't know about this for some time but dad standing there in west virginia he said the spirit of god spoke to him and said at the end of that train track that runs behind your house it'll direct you to the place where the truth is dad didn't know it till he was baptized down in jeffersonville that very train track goes right into jeffersonville i'm telling you god's in control [Applause] you might be looking at your children wondering about your children wondering about your loved ones but don't hang your head down you've got a great thing god he sought you out he came after you he did a work in your life have confidence that the same god who sucks you out and did a work in your life that same god will do it for them as well hereby know me the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that even jesus is come in the flesh is of god it's speaking of the word made flesh the real true baptism of the holy ghost where the word becomes flesh are you hearing me you see i wasn't just talking about when we talk about antichrist you realize it wasn't just those who were just passing away and saying well we don't believe in the spirit but now it comes down what does what is the purpose the purpose of the coming of the holy spirit is to confirm that place of worship so that the believers in that hour might recognize the place of acceptance that they might be drawn and come into that place where there's no condemnation god has reserved that responsibility to himself to confirm his word to his children and god calls us into this place that's why our lives it the the real baptism of the holy ghost is the quickening of that word that makes that word live in our life where our heart beats for god you see this coming of the antichrist spirit in that even there of the holy ghost remember here it came brother brown would bring this out the dove and the crow there in in in the raven in noah's ark you had the two run to parallel and moses and balaam right yeah right i mean balaam come under anointing is that right yes he came under anointing even things that were spoken through balaam they were true yeah right i'm talking about prophecies a star shall arise up out of jacob that took discernment of the spirit of god to be able to know that even within that because you remember while the wise men came and found the lord jesus it's because there had been a prophet down in babylon by the name of daniel that had taken them back in the scriptures and showed them that this is god's word and god will always keep his word and so those wise men were coming there on the word of a prophet that had been issued in in prophecy and here they were in position so the antichrist and the holy spirit running side by side brother ramsay just about the time i don't have this on the board just about the time that the holy spirit fell the antichrist spirit fell and he says notice he says it's just about in the last days when the antichrist is showing his colors inside the sixth seal coming up through these politics and things just about the time the antichrist moves himself fully on the scene god moves himself fully on to redeem his own it just runs right together all the time cain and abel judas and jesus and so forth so here we come into a play remember the bible has spoken to us in the scriptures regarding this name and notice here in the scripture let me just try to lay this part in here when jesus had said in john 15 26 when the comforter has come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me see what the holy spirit does it comes to confirm the word it becomes a testimony of a witness of the lord jesus christ and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning john 16 13 when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth amen i'm dealing with evidence right now of the holy ghost he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself in other words he doesn't draw attention to the vessel his attention is strictly in revealing himself through that life so it becomes a son or a daughter of god on display by the life of god but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so here not only they're present to guide us he's not only there present that it opens and opens our ears to hear what he is saying and he is a spokesman through our life but he also shows us things to come yes amen now i wish i could really preach on that one right now is this coming think about that you see not only do we need leadership into the truth right but god also and when we talk about show us things to come we're not just talking about prophecy right you realize everything that's taking place in the world right now is driven by prophecy all right not the president it's not the vatican it's not it's prophecy that's what's driving everything amen is that right but even on our own individual lives we need him to show us things to come in other words when there's times we're getting ready to make decisions we need him to uncover if you go this way amen amen but it's your decision we need him because he's the one he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart i'm so glad that in our lives god help us to stay in that place to even when we feel like i've made in my mind i feel pretty sure about this but let us always remain sensitive to say lord amen you got the last word on this [Music] that's right i might have good vibes about this or good feelings about this or i might feel all about this or whatever more come on i'm preaching right down to where the rubber hits the road right now this is one of the purposes of the coming of the holy ghost it ain't there so oh my we're walking on the clouds and everything else and i think of how brother browning used to put it you're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good come on now the bible says thy will be done but then that that will as he said in prayer he said thy will that is in heaven that it would be done in earth in earth that heaven would be reflected in earth [Applause] leave my life let it be influenced that divine connection there where the holy spirit has come and standing there there's no more chasm but he has filled the breach and we are tied back in to our theophany our representation before the throne of god just as much as a delegate of this area we would think would represent us down in washington dc and you vote for him and it's one person standing on your behalf let me tell you what the holy ghost it's one who's always stood for you and now the holy spirit himself he comes back to find you and bring you back to yourself and connect you back into your true representation we are seated in heavenly places delegates delegates of that heavenly jerusalem of the throne of god i feel like i'm all over the place here i hope that cake comes out good he'll lean and guide us into all truth we need all of that amen amen aren't you glad for that how he guides us in our lives and says more unfolds for us and we walk in it every one of us can every one of us can testify to this point there's things that god has dealt with our lives and we look back on and said god oh my i see it in a way now that my that that that's kind of been all along and yet god comes now and he deals with our heart in such a place and such a measure why it's a honing time it's honing in on things on our life the greatest thing compliment we can do is to just look to the lord and say lord wash me cleanse me lord and let that part of the word so live through me lord as i die to myself let him guide us into all truth i'm not talking about sinless perfection in the flesh i'm talking about guiding us into all truth amen john 5 43 well i'm trying to get somewhere here a little bit john 5 43 i am come in my father's name and you receive me not here he is standing before the pharisees now they knew all the titles they they knew about i mean they could take you to a place with they could probably take you on a tour of mount sinai and say well he he stood about right here they could go through all those things they knew brother graham tells us in spoken words original seed they knew the history of the god of moses but they didn't know the god of moses and here he stands before them i am come in my father's name now let's just let's just let me just have just a few moments and i'm just going to parachute out of here that name so to think of it the name of the father is jesus i'm just reading quotes here i don't have it there but i'm just going to refer to it the name of the father is jesus because jesus said so i carry my father's name you see even though even how the prophets would call him jesus you know even before his birth the prophets call him his name will be called emmanuel god with us his name's is not emmanuel but it would be called emmanuel god with us it was god who was manifested in the flesh now to think about this god placed his name in a man is that right not a church not a denomination not a creed but a man he chose to place his name in jesus christ he became the place of god's worship where you worship him think about how jesus said in john 17 6 i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world now there are many parts to that name remember moses was hidden in the rock and god caused his glory to pass by and there he proclaimed the name of the lord and the name of the lord it was not just not saying out jesus jesus but the name that was being proclaimed was god's own life all of the different attributes and characteristics of that name so the name itself when we say the name is jesus the name of the father is jesus god condescended he had to take on a human name in redemption but it was god's own life that is the name that's why in a service when the presence of god and the spirit of god is moving right here among his children we can say jesus is here it's not the corporal body but it's the same jesus that lived in that corporal body it's the same jesus that's vindicating that this is my place of worship not talking about a building but he's talking about the word that he has given for this hour he confirms it he manifests his name so his name reveals the place of acceptance his name reveals the place of his choosing his name being manifest reveals the place that he intends every worshiper to dwell amen notice brother graham said there's so many infallible proofs that jesus is the place he is the gate he is the name and the only provided way that god has for man to meet in worship i'm reading this one to you i've got that on the screen he is the way the truth the life the gate the door the alpha omega the beginning and the ending rosa sharon the lily of the valley the morning star the alpha omega he is all the whole thing put together amen he is both root and offspring of david the bride and morning star in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily where we in there are sons and daughters to god in god's godhead where we in there are sons and daughters of god praise the lord in god's godhead so when the fullness of the godhead bollywood that is the word itself god himself this is where our identity lays is in him amen oh glory be to god notice this and his sons and daughters were in the family if you're in there now think about this brother rabbit goes on he says now this this great place he said how do we get into this place if jesus is the place he is the name of god he's the place of god's worship he's the only door to the sheepfold and we want to find out how we get into him now think about this when you come into him you become family when you become family you begin to manifest that family name i mean you know it doesn't matter what family you know you you look back in the surname the family name and just like for my own self there's certain things that i can see certain characteristics of you know from my parents and in in the children and see certain things that have come out why because the name you need to name browning just having the last name browning just having the last name browning will not do it are you hearing me it it has to it's more that last name browning that's why somebody could look and say hey you look like a brownie because they're thick don't mean they're browning but you see somebody can look at something and they're looking say hey are you are you so and soar are you a sanchez or are you in this or are you a gomez and they'll start looking are you a keener and they'll start looking at certain things around there and pointing out why there's certain characteristics there are certain things that are carried on through that family that sometimes it's from way back if that's how it is in the natural how much greater is it in the spiritual amen we were always sons and daughters of god but it took the quickening power of the holy ghost the living god coming in his word to bring a real experience in our life that moves us from death unto life and we become family praise the lord amen have mercy ephesians 3 14 for this cause i bound my name my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named christ tell me what are you saying i'm saying if peter were to come down here this morning he wouldn't be ashamed all right brother branham could walk around not just into this church but we could fellowship together because we're in the same family but you don't get we don't get in a family buy you know my dad never asked me one day and said hey hey bud would you like to be a brownie i never joined it i know these are simple simple little things that's been all the way through the message we never joined it we never came to a spot to where eventually you know what this makes sense good theology just makes sense you know what i think i'll do that i think i'll i think that's what i'll do it's not we didn't join it it's not a joining it's a birth and a birth is a transformation yes amen amen a birth is a death of the old man because before there can ever be a birth there's got to be a death to where that even though we in our lives might be part of that natural tree like here i am i'm still a brownie but you see there's a greater tree that we are a part of that the spirit of god has come upon our lives to bring to life that seed that was on the inside there was a desire to serve god but there was obstacles in the way but he came when he came let me just tell you something when he come he don't just start ripping obstacles out of the way he makes himself known to you and i it's such a love affair that there ain't a wall big enough to hold you back are you hearing me it wasn't a wall big enough to hold you back because the love of god is there to tear it down god won't rip things out of our hands he won't rip sin out of our life but he comes with a manifestation of his name and when he does it draws us to see i want you jesus [Music] goodbye and you recognize lose of these things that are holding you back oh my let me let me finish on this part here how do we get in here the bible said by one spirit we're all baptized into one body that's first corinthians 12. now we can baptize people in here right and somebody has to completely just we have to tell them you know the cross and you know the hands and here we'll let you down and we'll bring you back up that's all our strength but we're fulfilling the word right but there's not a man that can baptize you into jesus christ you know sometimes you know i had a deacon or i had the deacons you know because sometimes that helped me out i'm weak after a service and things like that and that helps me out when they come up here and they baptize because i sometimes don't have hardly the strength and i'm concerned about maybe dropping somebody but to think about it jesus don't ever have somebody baptized for him he is the baptizer he's always present when it comes to being inducted into the body he's the one that baptizes us into the spirit this is the house of god this is the word of god this because a person can be baptized in water here and thank god that they would recognize repent of their sins but that's acknowledging an acceptance that's an asking for pardon are you hearing me but you see they can be baptized here and never go on to really receive the real overcoming life they can go right out you know in the world and everything else and maybe not go in the world but just sit on a church view are you hearing me but you see whenever that life becomes baptized into the holy ghost then it's no longer that person who's doing the living there is a reality that has struck that life on the inside they're no longer the same person their life is lived for the lord jesus christ it's just like let me just try to wrap this part of it up in this manner it's just like if you come to my house there's certain things we do in my house eating's one of them we do that pretty good but there's certain things the way things operate in our house you're welcome to come but this is how it's going to operate in our house there's an order in our family and there's an order in the family of god amen right right is that right like brother brahms said he said bran he said in our home we live like branhams right i mean who do you live like in your home hopefully you live like yourself right right hopefully you live like yourself there's an order in your home that you live by then so we're not shook in we're not joined in we're baptized in now watch this in paragraph 96 how long does it last when you get in there until you misbehave yourself ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption amen there's a possibility of grieving but inside inside the house of god the desire has been changed are you hearing me amen and there's things that we do have to say forgive me lord you know why because our desire even when we stood there and god brought conviction into our heart you know what i repent you know what real repentance is about is for recognizing not just that i'm a son and daughter of god but i've allowed that old nature to rule over my life and there's a greater one who's calling to me and i can yield to him how long does it last till you get in there until you misbehave yourself we're talking about real security by life of his presence brother said argue with him not me he said he said you're sealed until the day of your redemption until the day that jesus comes for you so you're not yourself let me just let me here wrap it up i know you keep hearing me say it but i really mean it you're not then yourself you're a new creature for the greek there means a new creation you've been re-created again all right the power of god comes upon you and you become created a new creature which brings the whole physical being spiritual being in everything in subject to the word of god amen not no other way amen you know for you and i when we stand here in our natural families it was a man and a woman who come together whether it's through hell holy wedlock or but and then needless to say there's a law of god right that when that of that life and that egg that that seed that comes together it's going there's going to be an offspring yeah so there had to be male and female is that right you have to think about it in our lives that seed of god was always there hallelujah was always there that representation of the word amen representation a part of the godhead lay within our life is that right remember when jesus came and said who do men say i am some say thou art jeremiah some say thou art some say they are this sometimes what is it each one of them were representing parts of the godhead right right to where when the the fullness of the godhead bodily was made manifest all of those colors that had been emitted down through those ages was now summed up in the person of jesus christ as he stood there in the fullness of his body is that right so now when we look at it this coming down in our lives the hour and the time that you and i are living in here within our life always a seed of god even of the things oh my i we we do we have no glory in that it's nothing but shame for things of the past of the where our lives were at but down beneath there was a seed down the whole time there was things that you can never satisfy we tried to try to satisfy that thirst but you couldn't quench it in any of the things of the world but it was that part that laid there but it needed the quickening power of god to come down this is why brother branham moved by the spirit of god would tell that eagle story over and over and especially in the last year of 1965 he almost used it every single service you know what that shows the eagle himself knew there was something different about me wanted to fit in something different he didn't know but mama eagle knew there was one of her children that was out there amen and she came and found him how did she find him not by earthly walkings she was flying into heaven amen hallelujah her eyesight from the heavens caught him that was on the ground and it was not an earthly scream from a seminary that caught his attention it was a heavenly voice it was a voice that was so inclined with heaven that heaven itself echoed back that message hallelujah a heavenly voice that reached down to you and i what did it do it causes our eyes not to look around right here not to look around at the dirt but to look up that's what the real true manifestation of jesus christ the name of god does it causes you to look away to jesus look beyond your circumstances look beyond the things of this earth because you are not a creature of time you are a creature of eternity you are never here just as a mere mortal upon this earth you are always a son and daughter of god amen and truly god has orchestrated many things to get you and i to where we are even right now this is why god would not even allow certain relationships to go on are you hearing me certain people you thought this or i'll go this way or i'll marry this one or i'll do this or i'll do that and how god himself has had everything in control even the best plans that we have we had certain plans of our future but god had different plans all along we didn't know it but his plans were out of this world i'm grateful for that if we can look back and see the hand of god upon our lives like that what about right now you can recognize the same god who came and sought us out brought us to himself that same god who would make himself known in the promise of his word for this day amen joy we're not just here gathered in a church just to be a church amen we've not gathered around this message because we're a bunch of rebels no that's a god calling to us as his children we've seen not just in the past but we see him making himself known not just here but in our own life and you know what that vindicates that life his life within us as it vindicates that we're in that place of worship we're in that place of worship we just stop this in clothing it's very very simple i know that very simple you if you won't have different examples you pray say god give him better examples but you know i like garlic and i know some of the rest of you do too but here's what my dad he came in my house and when my wife and i we really started cooking with garlic my dad would come in there and he said he'd pick up one of the boys he picked them up he said yeah you smell like your house your mom's been cooking with garlic again you see there was even some there was when i say that that seemed like a very carnal thing but you see that he knew that was an aroma in our home right now i went all the time because i you know you mostly nobody say i like candles that smell like cinnamon rolls and apple pies my wife sends me to pick out the candles richie he knew there was something about it this is from your house there's a certain smell or something but see it's even it's greater than that in the house of god your life my life declares where we're dwelling in the house of god by the way that we conduct our lives by even the things and the priorities and the life and the thing that we live you see friends it's one thing for us to say well i love the lord but realizing in saying we love the lord we realize it can't just be something that's up here and have just a thought of it but love the lord is something that should come out of our life that's what declares that we're in the house of god it's our life being lived according to the word because once we've been recreated it took that of god coming to his word and recreating we're a new creation it's no longer you or me trying to oh i'm going to try to live a christian life it's not that it's a supernatural god coming in a supernatural way doing a supernatural act in our life and you know the only thing that i had to do is just surrender that's all i had to do was surrender it's just yield to him and he come and done it how many witnesses that that's the truth you're just surrendered he just surrendered and matter of fact even when things are taking place you're not even aware of what's going on it's just my goodness things are just happening and how how things are just moving things are being turned around and you look back and you look back over your walk in your life and you say my goodness how god has been moving even up to this place at this point it's supernatural how god moves us the family of god we were always sons and daughters of god i we can't get to where i wanted to get to but as we've been recreated in him then our lives declare where we are dwelling in the house of god the way our life is lived just as much as the manifestation of his name can declare this is where my worship is at that's the same way his name is life dwelling in our lives and we in him it declares we are in him and he is in us so it's not it's not about what we say it's what he says he comes and vindicates it in our actions in our talkings and our doings vindicates it in our repentance the house of god asparagus lord jesus lord i always the greatest desire lord of my heart in my life as i stand here and i know for the the people lord that i stand before the desire lord is that you come on the scene and to the lord that you would speak lord regardless of how that i i might feel about things lord or i seem like i'm here and i'm there but lord

something lord sure we could read about it i read about it in the first part of january 2020 but i had no idea didn't the lord didn't didn't really look lord look at anything at that time none of us

believer how that you're with us lord every part through our life you guide us lord through the red sea you take us to the waters of mara then you take us to the lord the palms of elim for refreshment

branham would call it lord of that simple bush that would represent faith hyssop and speak of how that was cut down and thrown into the water and it was through you lord that the water became sweet lord jesus man can't know that the father even through this testing times and trials sure lord god there's been a lot of things around us fear has tried to come paul himself said i have fears within
