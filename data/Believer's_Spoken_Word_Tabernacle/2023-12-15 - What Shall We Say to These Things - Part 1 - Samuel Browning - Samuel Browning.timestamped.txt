[41:52] musicians I want to read from Romans
[41:55] chapter 8
[42:00] we're just going
[42:03] to just pause there just
[42:07] for a
[42:09] moment uh I actually had some things we
[42:11] were going to go into but I just
[42:13] couldn't get settled and the Lord just
[42:16] kept bringing back to my heart as we
[42:19] were in prayer so we just here want to
[42:21] look at
[42:22] this
[42:25] tonight I certainly believe as you we've
[42:27] heard the different requests that's been
[42:31] given and uh had been made and I was out
[42:34] to seen sister Anna there earlier my
[42:37] mother and I went out to see her earlier
[42:40] this afternoon she's doing well the Lord
[42:42] had uh completely uh restored her
[42:46] talking before she ever got to the
[42:49] hospital uh as well as I I didn't see
[42:52] any drooping on the right side at all
[42:55] when I was there uh she was just talking
[42:57] just as normal just as I would know
[42:59] sister Anna you would know sister Anna
[43:01] so uh certainly God is is is always
[43:07] present God is mindful of every one of
[43:09] his children so we just we thank the
[43:11] Lord for that we want to continue to
[43:13] keep in prayer they also when they did
[43:15] all of the um scans and things like that
[43:18] no blockages nothing that was there so
[43:23] um and there her blood pressure had been
[43:25] a little bit elevated and you know I we
[43:29] know understand anybody that's been
[43:31] through anything even a cal and cold or
[43:33] something like that sometimes your blood
[43:34] pressure can be elevated but
[43:36] irregardless we accept nothing but for
[43:39] it to come down that's right and so we
[43:42] just asked that You' just continue to
[43:44] keep her in prayer uh you you also heard
[43:47] the request there for uh sister Ruth
[43:50] Hoyer brother Ed and and sister Ruth and
[43:54] um I just want to say the doctors can
[43:57] look at what they can see and they look
[43:59] at a report but we've got a we've got a
[44:02] greater report that's right amen and I
[44:06] and I I'm not just saying that I mean
[44:09] that we've we've got news and I've just
[44:12] I've just come through even looking at
[44:14] different things the Holy Spirit from
[44:16] prayer later this evening just taking me
[44:18] back through so many different cases
[44:21] where uh even what we've seen here in
[44:23] the assembly let alone brother BMA go
[44:25] through it where they've said it
[44:27] couldn't get well brother BR I think as
[44:30] he talks about he calls out brother Bill
[44:31] da he said the doctor who said Bill da
[44:34] couldn't get well now that doctor's dead
[44:35] and here sets Bill Dow that's right
[44:38] that's right so you you understand it's
[44:40] important of what word we can hear those
[44:43] words but but what matters is is that we
[44:46] know we have a greater
[44:48] report and I think with sister Ruth her
[44:51] uh as it was come to me of her her
[44:54] response and her attitude was it is is
[44:56] I'm not going anywhere until God has
[44:58] finished with me and so that's that's
[45:01] that's that's the truth we're not going
[45:03] we're not going anywhere before that um
[45:06] also sister Michelle I don't think this
[45:09] was given as a prayer request but for
[45:11] sister Michelle you know we've been
[45:12] praying sister Michelle Carper we've
[45:14] been praying because there was a toe
[45:15] that was there that was very infected
[45:18] and she's uh you know uh been taking
[45:21] different medications for it and so
[45:23] forth and then it had been uh probably
[45:26] about a couple months now well here just
[45:28] the other day matter of fact it was just
[45:30] yesterday when all of this here
[45:32] yesterday was coming in is um she uh the
[45:36] pain in that toe that toe was red and
[45:38] there was a red line going up the leg
[45:41] which is um it's it's not good but we
[45:44] want to remember her in prayer they put
[45:47] her on a two antibiotics they've she's
[45:49] at home and if that doesn't turn around
[45:52] then she will have to go to the hospital
[45:53] there on um uh Friday or Saturday here
[45:57] one so we just want to hold our sister
[46:00] up in prayer and then um and then with
[46:03] Brother Bill that they gave their prayer
[46:04] request but did they go into anything
[46:06] with this so with Brother Bill they did
[46:08] the biopsy and uh they they did find
[46:11] that it was a form of cancer that's
[46:14] there but they've caught it at an early
[46:15] early stage and so what they're saying
[46:18] is is that they they either laser
[46:20] surgery or radiation but they want to
[46:22] give they want him to go into radiation
[46:24] he's got to go for a pet hand coming up
[46:27] and so with the radiation the doctor is
[46:29] really confident that he'll make a full
[46:31] recovery with that and plus not lose his
[46:33] voice and so uh that's where we're we're
[46:37] standing that's right we're
[46:39] standing and uh you know so I I just
[46:43] feel impressed of the Lord just here
[46:45] just as the Lord just directed my
[46:47] thoughts a little bit before service and
[46:48] we're just going to take this and preach
[46:50] it tonight Romans
[46:52] 8:31 and I want to just begin with that
[46:54] scripture what shall we then say to
[46:58] these
[46:59] things and that's what I want to speak
[47:01] on tonight what shall we then say to
[47:05] these things if God be for us who can be
[47:09] against
[47:11] us he that spared not his own son but
[47:14] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[47:18] not with him also freely give us all
[47:21] things who shall lay anything to the
[47:24] charge of God's elect it is God that
[47:27] justifieth who is he that condemneth it
[47:30] is Christ that died ye rather that is
[47:32] risen again who is even at the right
[47:35] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[47:38] for us who shall separate us from the
[47:41] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[47:45] distress or persecution or famine or
[47:50] nakedness or Pearl or sword as it is
[47:54] written for thy sake we are killed all
[47:57] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[48:00] for the slaughter we're not goats we're
[48:04] sheep that's right yes sir we're sheep
[48:07] right because we can be led and we know
[48:10] that he's leading us he never abandoned
[48:13] us like we looked at here just the past
[48:16] couple Thursday night lo I am with thee
[48:19] always nay in all these things we are
[48:23] more than conquerors through him that
[48:27] loved us and I love that phrase there I
[48:30] don't have this in front of me but you
[48:31] realiz more than conquerors that means
[48:34] gaining a surpassing victory that's
[48:37] right we're we're we're not just
[48:39] Victorious we're more than
[48:43] Victorious for I am persuaded that
[48:46] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[48:49] principalities nor powers nor things
[48:52] present nor things to come nor height
[48:55] nor dep depth nor any other creature
[48:57] shall be able to separate us from the
[49:00] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[49:03] lord amen may God bless you and bless
[49:05] the reading of the word as we're being
[49:08] seated we just see where we get to here
[49:11] tonight but I
[49:13] just um it's
[49:15] always a great comfort especially when
[49:18] things are I know when God even when
[49:21] he'll change something there at the last
[49:22] moment I'm confident in him to trust us
[49:25] to trust him to know that he knows what
[49:28] he wants to say and he knows what we
[49:29] have need of then as I sat back there
[49:32] and I'm hearing the comments that's
[49:34] being made I'm listening to the songs
[49:37] I'm hearing what's being prayed and
[49:39] things that you know are just making you
[49:40] aware of it I just say Lord I know I
[49:43] know I knew I was in the right channel
[49:45] but it's just how God brings a little
[49:48] confirmation and I know that no matter
[49:50] how many years that I've been
[49:52] ministering and speaking but I still
[49:54] enjoy those conf
[49:56] confirmations amen but I want to just
[49:59] say it in this way and I want to take
[50:01] that part what shall we say to these
[50:04] things because it it matters what we say
[50:09] and we realize that what we say comes
[50:12] from our thoughts and so it matters what
[50:14] we think upon and a lot of things that
[50:17] we cannot help what thoughts come in we
[50:21] cannot even help the things that we hear
[50:24] reports that we receive but we do have a
[50:28] place that we can take them to and we do
[50:31] have a confession that is greater than
[50:34] anything that the doctors or anyone else
[50:38] that can say and that is the Lord is my
[50:41] healer yes the Lord is my provider yes
[50:45] sir amen God God God is faithful to his
[50:51] word I tell you if there's one of the
[50:53] things that we could say in the the
[50:55] midst of this time and I would say God
[50:57] help us it's one of the things that I
[50:59] have learned within my walk with the
[51:02] Lord and uh and I certainly believe that
[51:05] I'm speaking to others as well and that
[51:07] is this I don't want any time at any
[51:10] moment to know the devil for the devil
[51:12] to know when I'm discouraged that's
[51:15] right right that's so true this is why
[51:17] brother BR said he said if I don't say
[51:19] it out Satan can't get to
[51:22] it is that right out of the seven series
[51:25] said if I don't say it out he can't get
[51:26] to it but you know this is where that
[51:28] even in times that we come into the
[51:31] realities of a sacrifice of praise
[51:33] because there sometimes it's not uh a
[51:36] sacrifice in order for us to praise the
[51:38] Lord sometimes it's very easy for us to
[51:41] praise the Lord there's times it's very
[51:42] easy to come to the house of the Lord
[51:45] there's times it's very easy and you can
[51:47] put whatever after that but then there
[51:49] are times and moments of sacrifice and
[51:52] when sacrifice comes it comes from us
[51:55] overcoming to be able to press Beyond
[51:58] circumstances that are not favorable
[52:01] conditions but yet God gives us Grace
[52:04] when we can think and to remember the
[52:07] goodness of the Lord that's right when
[52:09] we can think that God himself has never
[52:12] failed nor can he fail and this is where
[52:16] that no matter what we have before us it
[52:18] matters what we
[52:21] say concerning these things there's a
[52:24] woman in the scripture that we're very
[52:26] familiar with as the Holy Spirit would
[52:28] take me there and I think of this woman
[52:31] we know her we don't even know her name
[52:32] we just know that she's a woman of sh
[52:36] the shunamite woman and what we know is
[52:39] is that that in her life and in her walk
[52:42] with god brother br will take us in the
[52:44] message respects and brother BR said
[52:46] there's a little story he said no I
[52:48] don't know whether this story is true he
[52:50] said it would seem very fitting he said
[52:52] but remember she's a shunamite she's
[52:55] Gentile but yet here she and herself he
[52:58] says the story recounts when she was a a
[53:01] little girl that she saw or a younger
[53:04] lady she saw a little girl that was
[53:06] surrounded by dogs and and these dogs
[53:09] were going to attack this little girl
[53:11] but here was a man that came out of the
[53:13] Wilderness and those little dogs those
[53:15] dogs that were going to come at that
[53:17] little girl he took the staff that he
[53:20] have and he he he he he removed those
[53:22] dogs uh from harming that little girl
[53:25] and that always had an effect on her
[53:27] life because she knew there was
[53:29] something that was different about that
[53:31] man and brother B said now I don't know
[53:32] whether that's true or not he said but
[53:34] it seems like he said that it could be
[53:36] but
[53:37] irregardless here you find this woman
[53:40] that in a situation where here she comes
[53:44] and she receives a child and the Bible
[53:47] says in first second Kings
[53:50] 4:8 when the child was grown it fell on
[53:53] a day that he went out to his father to
[53:56] the Reapers and he said unto his father
[53:59] my head my head and he said to the lab
[54:02] carry him to his mother and when he had
[54:04] taken him and brought him to his mother
[54:06] he sat on her knees till noon and then
[54:08] died and she went up and laid him on the
[54:11] bed of the man of God and shut the door
[54:14] upon him and went out and she called
[54:17] unto her husband and said send me I pray
[54:19] thee one of the young men and one of the
[54:21] asses that I may run to the man of God
[54:24] and come again and he said wherefore
[54:27] wilt thou go today it is neither New
[54:30] Moon nor Sabbath and she said it shall
[54:34] be well that's
[54:36] right this was her
[54:39] testimony here is an event that I would
[54:42] say the day itself the way it started
[54:46] when they would have left maybe The
[54:47] Breakfast Table the way the course of
[54:50] events had went on this was not even in
[54:54] their mind mind for this event to have
[54:58] transpired it was not even in her
[55:01] thought I think of it what what if you
[55:04] know there are certain things that if we
[55:06] had known I I said this you know before
[55:08] when it came to when when the Lord had
[55:11] taken my dad when the purpose here was
[55:13] fulfilled I thought what if God had let
[55:16] us know that he was going to go in that
[55:18] moment we would have probably hounded
[55:21] him we would have you know kept him in
[55:23] such a place he would have never got any
[55:25] sleep cuz just another day just another
[55:27] moment just another time but you know
[55:29] what God had everything just perfect
[55:32] right I think about it as it was that
[55:35] you know where my brother he had not
[55:37] been here the year before it had been a
[55:38] couple years my brother hadn't even
[55:40] wasn't even here but how that God had
[55:43] things so arranged in a way my brother
[55:45] was here during that time the day before
[55:48] he would leave it certainly was not any
[55:50] event I'll just tell you that was not
[55:52] any event that I look forward to in my
[55:54] life
[55:55] never wanted to see that event come to
[55:57] pass but you know that within it all I
[56:00] know that all those things that times
[56:02] itself that all those times and must
[56:05] they they will come if we T and it isn't
[56:07] it doesn't even have to do with age
[56:10] there's they can be very youthful and
[56:12] where where the time and so forth has
[56:14] come so when none of us have the promise
[56:17] of tomorrow that's why David would say
[56:20] multiple times teach us to number our
[56:23] days teach us to count the moments and
[56:26] to Value every moment that we have and
[56:29] not so much I don't believe that David
[56:31] was talking just about valuing the
[56:33] moments with natural which we do value
[56:36] the moments that we have with family we
[56:38] cherish that when a loved one passes off
[56:40] the scene God's given us Grace in The
[56:43] Vault of our memory there in our spirit
[56:45] to go in and we extract and pull certain
[56:48] memories and we think upon those things
[56:50] from time to time but I I'm grateful
[56:53] that within in the midst of all these
[56:56] things that it's not it's not a finality
[56:58] to us as a Believer neither is it
[57:01] something that we and ourselves have the
[57:05] final say about because there's so many
[57:07] situations within the scripture that
[57:10] we're individuals have said this is it
[57:12] this is the finality but it isn't what
[57:15] man says it's What God
[57:18] Says amen
[57:22] right I still thinking I hope brother
[57:24] you're okay with me using this but as
[57:26] I've mentioned this and given this
[57:28] example in many situations where I've
[57:30] been in Ministry when Brother Ray his
[57:32] finger was only hanging by a thread and
[57:34] here I was um you know falling over the
[57:36] bed from shock from sin and I didn't
[57:38] know what was going on with me but they
[57:40] will me out there and the doctors are
[57:43] the doctor is trying to get him let's
[57:45] just take it off and I mean it was
[57:46] literally on by just a thread of Flesh
[57:50] everything's gone and I remember I went
[57:52] sat out there in the nurses station and
[57:55] I'm there they give me a cup of ice cuz
[57:57] I everything is just blurry to me like
[57:58] blacked out and this then everything
[58:01] starts as coming back and he comes over
[58:03] to me the doctor says hey he says listen
[58:05] he he's your parishioner uh you're
[58:07] you're you know you're his Minister his
[58:09] Pastor right I said yes sir he said look
[58:11] he said these are things right now he
[58:13] says he he's not wanting to accept this
[58:15] he said you look he said I believe
[58:17] there's things he said that God's
[58:19] already said there's things that where
[58:20] it's at the end and about that time it
[58:23] wasn't my thought but about that time it
[58:25] rose up within my heart and I said wait
[58:27] a minute what about
[58:31] Lazarus what about Lazarus it wasn't my
[58:34] thought but what about
[58:37] Lazarus right then and there I just I
[58:39] stood up and I said let's go I'm going
[58:41] to go pray and we prayed well you know
[58:43] the the the results testify for
[58:45] themselves of how God in his sovereignty
[58:48] moves on the
[58:49] scene what I'm saying is is that there's
[58:53] things that can look so leak things that
[58:55] look so dark but listen to me don't
[58:58] begin to speak the
[59:00] darkness speak the word speak the
[59:04] truth yes sir hallelujah it's an
[59:08] atmosphere you you are a Creator you are
[59:11] an amateur Creator you in looking at
[59:14] this and let me just say it like this I
[59:16] I've had individuals that have been
[59:18] around me in situations at times and
[59:20] individuals say well you just haven't
[59:22] been through this you haven't been
[59:23] through that some times people are
[59:25] pretty quick on the trigger to say that
[59:28] and yet here it is there's individuals
[59:30] that have been through that right and
[59:33] little did they know that just like in
[59:35] our situation we had been through that
[59:39] so we're not just saying something even
[59:41] as Believers in things to where well we
[59:43] haven't been through this we're saying
[59:45] it based on the word of almighty God and
[59:48] that's where we're standing when the
[59:50] prophet himself did not could could not
[59:53] see anything in in his body where
[59:55] everything wanted to continue to come up
[59:58] but yet he stood right there and he says
[1:00:00] by his stripes I am healed he walked
[1:00:03] away from the kitchen table and it was
[1:00:05] coming up and he had to swallow it back
[1:00:07] down by his stripes I am
[1:00:10] healed that's why the prophet said never
[1:00:13] if you can help it ever let a negative
[1:00:16] thought pass through he said but you
[1:00:18] can't help from them passing through but
[1:00:20] don't let them
[1:00:22] [Applause]
[1:00:23] Roost
[1:00:25] your testimony always let it be positive
[1:00:29] amen God is my healer amen hallelujah
[1:00:33] amen the work is finished
[1:00:36] amen you might look and say well brother
[1:00:39] Samuel how can you say that when you're
[1:00:41] praying for the sick how can you say
[1:00:43] that with different needs because as the
[1:00:45] Church of the Living God Mark 16 are the
[1:00:48] general orders that's right and we've
[1:00:51] never received any other
[1:00:59] orders yes sir Lord general orders stand
[1:01:03] then when they're specific orders those
[1:01:05] of you in the military know what I'm
[1:01:07] talking about when they're specific
[1:01:09] specific then is what is what overrides
[1:01:12] or moves beyond the general and we stand
[1:01:14] upon God's word and we don't have to see
[1:01:17] a vision we do not have to hear a word
[1:01:20] from God to know I'm the Lord that
[1:01:22] Health all th diseases
[1:01:25] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:01:27] they shall
[1:01:29] recover that's what this message came to
[1:01:33] bring to you and I Hallelujah the
[1:01:35] prophet said in perfect faith I can have
[1:01:37] a vision he said but do you realize this
[1:01:40] is greater than the vision so good so
[1:01:44] good is that what he said yes it is this
[1:01:47] is greater than the vision so what was
[1:01:49] the purpose of the Visions is to make us
[1:01:52] aware that the God that was is
[1:01:55] still he's the god of his
[1:01:59] work I'm want to say this that there is
[1:02:01] no doubt we don't have here in this
[1:02:03] scripture setting as I think about it we
[1:02:07] don't have recorded here all the
[1:02:11] emotions that no doubt she felt we don't
[1:02:14] have recorded the emotions that the
[1:02:17] father felt right we don't have all the
[1:02:20] battles of the mind that they fought so
[1:02:24] when we're reading this we're not
[1:02:28] ignorant of how that there was battles
[1:02:31] that they had to press through but
[1:02:33] through it all through all of their
[1:02:35] battles because there's nothing uh that
[1:02:38] has taken us by surprise or any strange
[1:02:42] thing or any temptation but such is
[1:02:44] common to man but notice within the
[1:02:47] midst of it of how that she responded
[1:02:50] within it it shall be
[1:02:53] well
[1:02:55] right then she saddled an asked and said
[1:02:57] to her servant drive and go forward and
[1:03:00] slack not thy writing for me except I
[1:03:03] bid thee I'm asking you where did she
[1:03:06] get the strength that's right that's I'm
[1:03:09] asking you where did she get the
[1:03:11] strength to say saddle the
[1:03:14] ass and I don't want to stop I we're
[1:03:17] going to go until we get
[1:03:18] there in other words no turning aside I
[1:03:22] don't care what obstacle comes up
[1:03:24] I don't care what other report comes up
[1:03:27] I don't care what other scan comes up
[1:03:29] we're not
[1:03:30] stopping hallu that's so good that's
[1:03:33] what we're saying to these things right
[1:03:36] hallelujah it's not new moon it's not a
[1:03:38] special day it doesn't have to be a
[1:03:40] special day because I'm a special person
[1:03:43] by a special God that's been made ready
[1:03:47] and Redeemed by a special
[1:03:51] blood
[1:03:52] Hallelujah aren't you glad we don't have
[1:03:54] to have a special time or a special
[1:03:57] thing that God is ever present and we
[1:03:59] can go to him at any time with any
[1:04:02] situation with any
[1:04:04] need I'm glad for
[1:04:07] that she went up the Bible says in verse
[1:04:09] 25 and she came into the man of God to
[1:04:12] Mount Carmel and it came to pass when
[1:04:14] the man of God saw her a far off that he
[1:04:17] said to Gesa his servant behold Yonder
[1:04:20] is that shunamite run now I pray thee to
[1:04:23] meet her
[1:04:24] and say unto her is it well with thee is
[1:04:28] it well with thy husband is it well with
[1:04:31] thy child and she
[1:04:34] answered what did she say it is well
[1:04:38] Hallelujah woman of shiman what shall we
[1:04:41] say to these things Hallelujah it is
[1:04:47] well are you hearing me that's so good
[1:04:50] you think she didn't feel like saying do
[1:04:52] you got a couple hours right you got a
[1:04:55] little bit of
[1:04:57] time but she said in her response all is
[1:05:03] well this was not mind over matter she
[1:05:06] knew where she had to get to and she had
[1:05:09] arrived there and for her all is
[1:05:12] well because this child was a product of
[1:05:15] the spoken
[1:05:18] word the same God who gave it is the
[1:05:21] same God who can raise it back up
[1:05:24] she didn't understand why did these
[1:05:27] events happen how did these events
[1:05:29] happen but where she was standing is a
[1:05:31] place of Wellness It is Well amen she
[1:05:36] had come to the place she needed to get
[1:05:42] to sometimes it takes a lot of Grace and
[1:05:47] pressing these aren't things I want you
[1:05:49] to think when we're reading these
[1:05:50] scriptures these are not
[1:05:53] things that it was
[1:05:55] just fingers being
[1:05:58] snapped and saying well you shouldn't
[1:06:00] think that way that I want you to
[1:06:01] understand this tonight if you have you
[1:06:04] have any understanding at all you
[1:06:06] understand that's not how I'm preaching
[1:06:08] this I am not preaching this neither and
[1:06:10] you know me neither as a pastor have I
[1:06:13] ever come to anyone who's been in a
[1:06:15] situation to say snap out of it I don't
[1:06:18] believe that that shows no that what
[1:06:20] that does not show faith it shows
[1:06:21] ignorance go
[1:06:24] the Bible didn't say we didn't mourn and
[1:06:26] sorrow it said we don't sorrow as
[1:06:31] others it didn't say that we don't
[1:06:34] experience fears but we have a resource
[1:06:39] that's able to push the fears
[1:06:41] out it did not say that things would not
[1:06:45] come around but we have an advocate with
[1:06:48] the father we have a resource we have a
[1:06:52] strength that God gives gives us to be
[1:06:55] able to stand there thank you
[1:06:57] Jesus I I'm just going to tell you this
[1:07:00] part even to this right to this moment
[1:07:02] is a miracle to
[1:07:04] me I don't know if I don't know if
[1:07:06] you've ever felt that way but there's
[1:07:08] times when I'm right in the midst of
[1:07:09] something and I just say Lord I'm just
[1:07:12] thankful right now I don't know the
[1:07:14] answer I don't know how this is going to
[1:07:15] work out I I don't but one thing I'm
[1:07:17] just thankful for is the peace you've
[1:07:20] given me for this situation I would
[1:07:22] rather have that than have all the
[1:07:25] knowledge this will happen that'll
[1:07:26] happen this I would rather have
[1:07:29] that because that's what'll hold me and
[1:07:32] guide me through it all because there
[1:07:33] might be something that will come up in
[1:07:36] the midst of all that time but when God
[1:07:39] has spoken and that
[1:07:41] peace is something that we didn't create
[1:07:45] this woman of schum didn't create she
[1:07:47] didn't work herself up into this
[1:07:52] am Hallelujah
[1:07:54] but let me just tell you it matters the
[1:07:56] resource that you have sure do in your
[1:08:00] life this is a mystery what when we read
[1:08:04] this and others can read this here's the
[1:08:07] secret of
[1:08:08] this she knows she's a daughter of God
[1:08:13] Amen she has the scripture in an earlier
[1:08:16] verse of this she saw the man of God and
[1:08:19] perceived he was a man of
[1:08:22] God and when she perceived he was a man
[1:08:25] of God this was before the child come
[1:08:27] that had been passing by their way and
[1:08:30] here here he comes by and she says to
[1:08:32] her husband let's make a room in the
[1:08:34] house so when he comes here he's got a
[1:08:38] place to stay in other words I want the
[1:08:42] word in my
[1:08:44] home she wasn't waiting for a rainy day
[1:08:49] she wasn't looking for when things get
[1:08:51] tight I know him I've seen him he goes
[1:08:53] by this way we'll just run him down
[1:08:55] that's not how a Believer approaches God
[1:08:58] a Believer walks in preparation before
[1:09:02] adversity
[1:09:04] strikes are you hearing me she had
[1:09:07] already made way for
[1:09:09] Elisha a place that he could come as a
[1:09:12] prophet of God one who had the word of
[1:09:15] God she made room she had respects
[1:09:18] Hallelujah am I tell you what if there's
[1:09:21] anything we need to make room for in our
[1:09:23] lives it's for the word amen if there's
[1:09:26] anything that we need to make room for
[1:09:28] it's the word in our homes because let
[1:09:30] me just tell you something adversity
[1:09:32] will
[1:09:34] strike Jesus said in Matthew 7 he said
[1:09:37] look it's going to strike But be sure
[1:09:39] where your house is builing if it's
[1:09:41] built on a rock or built on a sand the
[1:09:43] same storms the same winds the same hail
[1:09:46] everything is going to come but it
[1:09:48] matters what is in your
[1:09:52] dwelling amen
[1:09:54] just be honest with you friends I don't
[1:09:56] know how people face it without knowing
[1:09:59] where they're standing with God I don't
[1:10:01] know how they do that right because let
[1:10:04] me tell you something when the Bible
[1:10:06] said remember thy Creator in the days of
[1:10:08] thy youth I I don't just look at that
[1:10:10] scripture when it says lest the evil
[1:10:12] days come not I just do not look at that
[1:10:14] scripture and think oh that's just for
[1:10:16] teenagers I it's for all youthfulness
[1:10:19] while you've got your right mind right
[1:10:22] while you're in your right mind why
[1:10:23] you've got your health now is the day of
[1:10:26] salvation now is the time to let him be
[1:10:29] the Lord of your life because there's
[1:10:31] going to be adversity strike and you're
[1:10:33] going to need an anchor an absolute
[1:10:36] something that is greater than your
[1:10:39] abilities to pull you through anchor you
[1:10:41] and stabilize you through it all
[1:10:46] glory brother Samuel I've got the church
[1:10:48] you need more than just the church you
[1:10:50] need a personal Jesus having a church
[1:10:52] body to pray for you love you and care
[1:10:55] for you is wonderful but you've got to
[1:10:57] know this Jesus
[1:11:01] yourself there's got to be an
[1:11:03] opportunity where you made preparation
[1:11:06] in your
[1:11:07] life yes sir I just passing on by I
[1:11:10] don't need it right now I know I'm not
[1:11:12] just speaking here uh to the to the
[1:11:13] audience right here but this is going
[1:11:15] out streamers and those are archived for
[1:11:17] everyone it's very important amen and
[1:11:20] when I say making room for the word I'm
[1:11:22] not talking about mentally agreeing with
[1:11:25] it I'm talking about where you've made
[1:11:27] room in your life for the person of
[1:11:30] Jesus Christ to move in there's a space
[1:11:32] in your life that says this is reserved
[1:11:35] for him there might have been other
[1:11:38] guests that wanted to come by and said
[1:11:40] can I stay in that room nope that room
[1:11:42] is reserved for the man of
[1:11:45] God there might have been other things
[1:11:47] that want to come by and say can I have
[1:11:49] your testimony nope you can't have my
[1:11:52] testimony
[1:11:54] GL it's reserved for him my life is
[1:11:57] reserved for
[1:11:59] him my emotions are reserved for
[1:12:04] himall it
[1:12:06] matters it
[1:12:08] matters because
[1:12:10] adversity
[1:12:12] comes and I'm just going to stay very
[1:12:14] very be very clear with this L sometimes
[1:12:18] when adversity strikes people can become
[1:12:22] religious
[1:12:24] it now and you know what God knows all
[1:12:27] about that let me just tell you this
[1:12:28] right now God will heal lives and hearts
[1:12:33] that he knows won't even continue to
[1:12:35] serve
[1:12:37] him he's done it many times he'll do it
[1:12:42] you know why because God's love for
[1:12:45] Humanity right yes sir very true glad it
[1:12:50] ain't limited to you and
[1:12:52] I but I was would say this right here I
[1:12:54] would rather have the healing of my
[1:12:56] soul than to have the healing of my
[1:13:00] body because this body it can get sick
[1:13:04] again but you know what was important is
[1:13:08] she had made room for the word in their
[1:13:13] life Satan you know had come in there
[1:13:15] and like how brother Bram dramatized
[1:13:17] that Satan said when he saw this child
[1:13:20] 12 years old this child had just come to
[1:13:22] the age of
[1:13:24] accountability and Satan said I'm going
[1:13:26] to get rid of it now I want you to think
[1:13:29] about something for a
[1:13:31] moment how are you going to
[1:13:34] destroy a word from the
[1:13:37] Lord are you hearing me I'm not talking
[1:13:41] about the flesh body but the flesh body
[1:13:43] was a visible form that the word that
[1:13:45] was spoken that entered into her mind
[1:13:48] received in her heart came forth in her
[1:13:50] womb was standing there before her she
[1:13:53] had cared for thus saith the Lord for 12
[1:13:56] years that's so true Hallelujah come on
[1:13:59] now think about in your life what is it
[1:14:02] that's brought the birth in your life
[1:14:04] what is it that's brought forth Christ
[1:14:06] in your life it took a word from the
[1:14:09] Lord in this
[1:14:12] generation we were baren
[1:14:15] people are you hearing me baren people
[1:14:18] might have had charismatic Spirit
[1:14:20] everything else around but we were baren
[1:14:23] people right but God came by our way
[1:14:26] amen and since that time listen since
[1:14:30] that time for 12 years she had been
[1:14:33] caring for that boy any mama knows what
[1:14:35] I'm talking
[1:14:38] about I know what I'm talking about not
[1:14:41] only do I have my mama sitting here that
[1:14:43] constantly will check on me even right
[1:14:45] now 48- year old
[1:14:50] boy Samuel you need to be doing this and
[1:14:53] that's she ain't tell me what to do but
[1:14:54] you need to be resting you need should
[1:14:55] be doing this honey Sam you should be
[1:14:57] how's everything I'm praying for you
[1:14:59] always getting text I'm praying for you
[1:15:01] but I know I also see the boys I see
[1:15:03] their
[1:15:05] mama there you go there you go like the
[1:15:09] other day we were sitting the
[1:15:10] Chick-fil-A and she looked over Paul he
[1:15:11] came over to the table she said she said
[1:15:13] Paul Paul Paul Paul have you ate now
[1:15:16] he's working he's
[1:15:18] working I said what were you going to do
[1:15:20] if he said he hadn't
[1:15:22] ate
[1:15:24] what were you going to do that's good go
[1:15:26] back and look up the managers and say
[1:15:27] hey wait a
[1:15:30] minute I know she's a little old thing
[1:15:32] but don't you touch her boys that's
[1:15:34] right that's right let me just tell you
[1:15:37] something right now you and I that are
[1:15:40] born of the spirit of God that New
[1:15:42] Jerusalem Hallelujah is mother of us all
[1:15:48] Hallelujah and God said our names are
[1:15:50] written in the palm of his hands
[1:15:54] thank you Lord no man can plck them out
[1:15:57] Hall nothing can take you
[1:16:01] out God has watched over it same thing
[1:16:04] in your life my life what has what has
[1:16:06] our life once that word has become flesh
[1:16:09] in our life where it's not just a seed
[1:16:12] word but now it's a visible Christ
[1:16:14] moving in our life we see our life being
[1:16:17] changed we know it Desires in our life
[1:16:19] what has happened to our life the same
[1:16:22] way like a mother does to a child it
[1:16:24] begins to cater to around that child to
[1:16:26] minister to those needs that's the same
[1:16:28] way your life and my life as a Believer
[1:16:30] it has catered around the word that has
[1:16:32] come to pass in our
[1:16:36] life sir decisions we
[1:16:39] make right right and think after after
[1:16:43] 12 years Satan says I'm going to get rid
[1:16:45] of this
[1:16:47] child you know he thought he was going
[1:16:49] to discourage
[1:16:50] her that's why brother BR when he
[1:16:53] responds in in this in the message he
[1:16:55] said did it discourage
[1:16:58] her now let's just look at it for a
[1:17:00] moment there ain't no doubt that her
[1:17:03] flesh felt
[1:17:05] discouragement there ain't no doubt in
[1:17:07] her mind when she's sitting there you
[1:17:11] think Satan wasn't right there right up
[1:17:13] next when she had the babe or the child
[1:17:15] on her knee Satan was all around
[1:17:19] there and here you have given the word
[1:17:22] place in your life your whole life has
[1:17:25] revolved around it look at your son now
[1:17:29] same thing he came near the
[1:17:32] prophet same same way he'll come to
[1:17:35] either of us any of us when things
[1:17:37] aren't going just exactly that's right
[1:17:41] the right direction that's good preach
[1:17:43] yes sir yes come on now I know what I'm
[1:17:47] talking about oh yeah but here that
[1:17:50] didn't discourage
[1:17:52] her there was a respect that she
[1:17:55] had and when she came there to Elijah
[1:17:57] Elijah didn't know what to tell her
[1:18:00] right I don't know he said I don't know
[1:18:02] what's wrong God's hid it from me right
[1:18:05] but when they went and asked the
[1:18:07] question her response is all is
[1:18:11] well it it matters you know that's
[1:18:13] overcoming it matters what we say
[1:18:15] concerning these
[1:18:17] things it's like when brother brandom
[1:18:19] says and how can I overcome he says you
[1:18:21] know he said the doctor says
[1:18:23] this a direct quote the doctor says you
[1:18:26] got cancer and you sayoh no I don't got
[1:18:28] cancer he said oh no you got cancer but
[1:18:32] remember the god in you is greater and
[1:18:36] has already overcome it this is what the
[1:18:39] doctor has said so we're not walking by
[1:18:41] our imagination we're saying okay this
[1:18:44] is what the doctor has said but
[1:18:47] hallelujah it's like if this is the
[1:18:49] doctor's report right here I'm not going
[1:18:51] to let that be the top
[1:18:53] report there's another report
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:58] Hall Satan wants to try to move this
[1:19:01] around no there's another
[1:19:04] report God is higher he's
[1:19:15] greater BR says what if she would have
[1:19:17] come up and said you said you was a
[1:19:19] servant of God right you hypocrite m I
[1:19:23] do believe you ain't nothing but a Holy
[1:19:24] Roller it had never have happened that's
[1:19:27] right God tries us sometimes to see what
[1:19:31] we'll
[1:19:32] do but she run you know the scripture
[1:19:35] she run up to his feet and she worshiped
[1:19:37] like she was to God she recognized God
[1:19:40] was represented in that Prophet she
[1:19:44] wasn't worshiping the prophet because
[1:19:46] listen the prophet would have had derer
[1:19:48] and stood her up like he did John on the
[1:19:50] ale of patas right amen but what she
[1:19:53] recognized is it was God in that Prophet
[1:19:56] she was not worshiping that Prophet
[1:19:58] that's why they look at you and say man
[1:20:00] worshipper I'm not worshiping a man but
[1:20:03] I recognize that what I have received is
[1:20:05] not the thoughts of a man it's the
[1:20:07] thoughts of God so I am worshiping God
[1:20:10] in the way you call crazy in the way you
[1:20:13] call heresy this is God's thoughts
[1:20:16] concerning his
[1:20:17] word and I am worshiping the Living
[1:20:21] God
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:32] and here he was he walked up and down
[1:20:33] the floor but she I want you to catch
[1:20:35] what brother Bram says here I I didn't
[1:20:37] post these but I just want you to listen
[1:20:39] as I refer to it she was a reverent
[1:20:41] woman praise God a woman that respected
[1:20:44] him a man that respected him and
[1:20:46] believed him to be a man of God yeah and
[1:20:49] he walked back and forth up and down the
[1:20:50] floor until God answered praise God
[1:20:54] that's so good you know Brother Carlos
[1:20:55] think about that here she goes to there
[1:20:58] and he says go take the staff to
[1:21:01] Gesa she's not moving I'm not leaving
[1:21:04] until you
[1:21:06] come I'm not leaving here until you come
[1:21:09] and when the prophet gets back there the
[1:21:11] prophet does not walk into the courtyard
[1:21:13] of her house nor up there to the room
[1:21:16] with a direct word from God that's right
[1:21:19] he doesn't know what to
[1:21:21] do that's so good Hallelujah he doesn't
[1:21:25] know what to do you've walked in and
[1:21:28] we'll walk in and so have I and will I
[1:21:31] walk into situations that I don't know
[1:21:34] what to do I don't even know what do I
[1:21:38] begin to even
[1:21:40] say but if you just obey the
[1:21:44] Lord Lord I I'm here just to be a
[1:21:47] servant I'm here just to be a channel if
[1:21:50] I can be a help in any way Lord if if
[1:21:53] you can use these hands if you can use
[1:21:56] these lips Lord You're the vine I'm the
[1:21:59] branch if there's anything Lord that I
[1:22:01] can do amen hallelujah you know what
[1:22:04] that kind of an attitude brother Bram
[1:22:06] relates that to you and
[1:22:08] I of how he says God took over
[1:22:12] Elisha he said just like God will take
[1:22:15] over your life he said it'll start
[1:22:18] little by little he said if you just let
[1:22:19] him he'll just take it all over he'll
[1:22:21] crowd everything else out he'll crowd
[1:22:23] out all malice he'll crowd out all
[1:22:24] bitterness he'll crowd everything out if
[1:22:26] you'll just let him he said
[1:22:29] Elisha let everything be put out and it
[1:22:32] was nothing left but
[1:22:35] God I said Lord grant that Lord I I want
[1:22:39] more of
[1:22:40] him there's more room for
[1:22:43] him when when I if I'm still here that
[1:22:46] means there's still growth
[1:22:48] am there's more I want him to take over
[1:22:52] completely that's why brother Brown
[1:22:54] described when he laid himself on that
[1:22:56] man that had been run over I think it
[1:22:57] was on them railroad tracks the man was
[1:22:59] dead and brother Brown said I laid on
[1:23:01] that man and he said before long here
[1:23:04] the warmth came back in that body and
[1:23:06] eventually he said the man was speaking
[1:23:07] to me what happened God took
[1:23:11] over hallelujah what happens in your
[1:23:14] life God takes
[1:23:16] over prise name Jesus Hallelujah this
[1:23:19] isn't something we're working ourselves
[1:23:21] up into this is something that God is
[1:23:26] doing that's why it pays to have good
[1:23:29] friends
[1:23:30] yeah sure does yes there was a guy on a
[1:23:34] cop one time he had four
[1:23:37] friends pay to have good friends those
[1:23:41] were some mighty good friends cuz those
[1:23:42] friends did not just look at his
[1:23:44] condition and say just make sure I'm in
[1:23:46] your
[1:23:48] will just make sure things are all right
[1:23:50] with me no those guys were good friends
[1:23:53] oh yeah you know why they knew what he
[1:23:55] needs is to get in the presence of Jesus
[1:23:58] Amen so they packed together ain't that
[1:24:02] amazing you got four people
[1:24:05] together there were four corners like it
[1:24:08] were like carrying the Ark of the
[1:24:10] Covenant they were in agreeance like the
[1:24:13] for
[1:24:13] anointing isin't it amazing you get
[1:24:16] people in agreeance and Harmony you know
[1:24:18] all it takes is just get Jesus on your
[1:24:20] mindall when you get the Lord on your
[1:24:23] mind it'll bring
[1:24:24] Unity because when you go to think about
[1:24:27] him you cannot be disunified right
[1:24:33] Hallelujah and needless to say you know
[1:24:35] the end of the story the Bible said the
[1:24:37] Lord was present there to heal him and
[1:24:39] they got him where he was at important
[1:24:42] to have good
[1:24:44] friends right this is why the scripture
[1:24:47] when it when said whosoever receiveth a
[1:24:49] prophet in the name of a prophet
[1:24:50] receives a prophet's reward
[1:24:53] brother Braham said that's to be a
[1:24:54] friend of a prophet he said if they want
[1:24:57] to know what a prophet's reward is it's
[1:24:59] to be a friend to the prophet that's a
[1:25:01] reward he's your
[1:25:03] friend why you've received him in the
[1:25:06] name or the
[1:25:08] characteristic of a prophet you've
[1:25:11] recognized this is God's spokesman for
[1:25:14] the hour you've given the word place in
[1:25:18] your life you've given it place in your
[1:25:21] home and not just place I I believe with
[1:25:24] all my heart that as Believers it's not
[1:25:26] us just giving the word a little place
[1:25:28] and saying you can only stay right here
[1:25:30] but when we have made place in our life
[1:25:33] it's to say you're welcome amen
[1:25:35] throughout the entire house not just on
[1:25:38] the welcome mat but you're welcome in
[1:25:40] every door of my house you're welcome in
[1:25:42] the door of pride in the door of faith
[1:25:44] in the door of selfish you're welcome
[1:25:46] throughout the house if you want a
[1:25:48] sandwich the refrigerator is yours hallu
[1:25:52] be careful who you invite with that
[1:25:57] invitation brother BR said it's like the
[1:25:58] shunamite
[1:26:00] woman it might come in handy
[1:26:03] sometime being a friend of the
[1:26:06] Prophet
[1:26:09] Hallelujah it come in handy for me how
[1:26:11] about
[1:26:13] you amen
[1:26:16] hallelujah glory be to God oh Lord have
[1:26:20] mercy I getting ready to give another
[1:26:21] test want to he but I I want to just
[1:26:23] make this next statement here out of
[1:26:26] John 11 verse
[1:26:30] 21 the Bible said then said Martha unto
[1:26:35] Jesus here they
[1:26:37] come man everything
[1:26:40] this the tragedy that had taken place
[1:26:44] and Martha I want you to remember this
[1:26:47] see God has situations sometimes that
[1:26:49] knows how to get us out of our comfort
[1:26:51] zone Martha was the one he spoke to
[1:26:53] before and said you're so
[1:26:56] cumbered so Laden with so many other
[1:27:00] things you've you you left off the
[1:27:03] important things M remember Mary Martha
[1:27:05] was in here you know and this and that
[1:27:07] and doing this and that and this and and
[1:27:09] Mary just dropped it all when Jesus came
[1:27:13] yes and that's where Jesus told Martha
[1:27:16] you're so cumbered with so many
[1:27:18] things see God God knows how
[1:27:22] situations to aay things and rising and
[1:27:25] it it opens up in so many different ways
[1:27:30] and she said if thou Hast been here my
[1:27:31] brother had not died but I know that
[1:27:35] even now I love those
[1:27:38] words I know even
[1:27:42] now amen I think how brother brandham
[1:27:44] over and over he talks about sister
[1:27:47] Weaver who he
[1:27:49] baptized where they didn't even give her
[1:27:52] to the next day to live because she was
[1:27:54] ridden with
[1:27:57] cancer but she walked into the Waters of
[1:28:01] baptism they wheed her down in a
[1:28:03] wheelchair and took her in and baptized
[1:28:05] her in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:09] Christ she was healed
[1:28:14] completely what am I saying even
[1:28:18] now that's good even now oh yes
[1:28:23] amen that's no matter what situation no
[1:28:26] matter what you have before you what we
[1:28:29] have before us as a church as a family
[1:28:32] even now
[1:28:34] Lord even
[1:28:37] now whatsoever thou will ask of God God
[1:28:41] will give it Thee I want to remind you
[1:28:45] when you have been born of the spirit of
[1:28:47] God and you pray according to the word
[1:28:49] he said ask the father anything in my
[1:28:51] name and I'll do it he said it's the
[1:28:53] spirit of Jesus Christ praying through
[1:28:58] you so it's not you just asking
[1:29:01] something it's him praying through
[1:29:04] you Hallelujah there's a need that you
[1:29:07] have and there's a request that is being
[1:29:10] made known ask the father anything in my
[1:29:12] name and I will do it even
[1:29:16] nowall so good think about it when he
[1:29:21] stands there you know you you know the
[1:29:23] scripture how it goes yes Lord
[1:29:26] truly truly you know he he wouldn't have
[1:29:30] died but I and I know I know he'll raise
[1:29:33] you know in the resurrection well that's
[1:29:34] true but Jesus had to help her to
[1:29:38] understand I am the resurrection and
[1:29:41] life even for those that are going to be
[1:29:43] raised I am that resurrection and life I
[1:29:46] am the
[1:29:48] Fulfillment of the needed atonement
[1:29:51] atonement my life will
[1:29:54] atone it will raise up all that have
[1:29:57] been tied to that scarlet cord I am the
[1:30:01] resurrection and
[1:30:03] life he was announcing that I'm not in
[1:30:07] the future nor am I in the past I
[1:30:11] am even now I think I think if they
[1:30:15] could say anything right now regarding
[1:30:18] no matter the situation the reports and
[1:30:20] things that we every listen even
[1:30:23] now yes brother Samuel I know there's
[1:30:27] not good statistics on
[1:30:29] this but there's greater
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:35] statistics yes let me tell you something
[1:30:39] friends if when we hear the word cancer
[1:30:43] if we never had ever heard or witnessed
[1:30:47] one person be healed of cancer we might
[1:30:50] have a right to doubt
[1:30:54] out and yet we wouldn't because he said
[1:30:59] I'm the Lord that Health all thy
[1:31:03] diseases Hallelujah but because we have
[1:31:08] witnessed it even in our local assembly
[1:31:11] yes amen I thank God for testimonies
[1:31:14] throughout but we've witnessed that here
[1:31:17] so when we are praying for the needs of
[1:31:19] others here and other places we are
[1:31:21] praying with also a direct witness to
[1:31:24] know that God still heals
[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:30] cancer well brother Samuel we don't know
[1:31:33] the outcome of this we didn't know the
[1:31:34] outcome for Sister Rita we didn't know
[1:31:37] the outcome for others but we know this
[1:31:39] that God is faithful to his word and
[1:31:42] we're going to stand with general
[1:31:44] orders on the word of they shall
[1:31:49] recover that's what he said amen and
[1:31:52] there's no higher
[1:31:54] word than his
[1:31:58] word and the prophet says it like this
[1:32:00] he says if we receive it in the spirit
[1:32:03] by his stripes I'm Healed there is no
[1:32:06] higher court of
[1:32:11] appeal I say oh God let it just let it
[1:32:14] resonate Let It Drop in there let me say
[1:32:16] this to you right now we could go on and
[1:32:18] on with this but this is very important
[1:32:21] and what shall we say to these things
[1:32:23] this is why the prophet could take even
[1:32:25] John Ryan and take others and say say it
[1:32:29] and say it over and say it over and say
[1:32:32] it over and say it
[1:32:34] over oh brother brandom I don't know if
[1:32:37] I believe it he said say it till you do
[1:32:39] believe
[1:32:42] it
[1:32:43] Hallelujah that's good
[1:32:46] hallelujah
[1:32:50] hallelujah
[1:32:54] and here's where here's where it was at
[1:32:56] take away the
[1:32:58] stone I mean brother Brian here they are
[1:33:00] they're going through a grieving moment

[1:33:45] need them who were going through a
[1:33:48] moment when they had lost their brother
[1:33:51] and the Jews think about it they had
[1:33:52] made a stand for this word they had made
[1:33:54] room for the word in their house that's
[1:33:57] right and a situation of Crisis a dark
[1:34:00] hour

[1:35:02] they he said to Martha but the Bible
[1:35:05] says then they rolled away the stone
[1:35:08] they had to come some
[1:35:10] Unity that's good that's why we need one
[1:35:14] another that's why when we go through
[1:35:16] things even as a church we need to stand
[1:35:19] there to encourage one another am amen
[1:35:22] listen friends Satan even through this
[1:35:25] where Co hit us a few years ago wanted
[1:35:27] to so divide people so separate things
[1:35:30] to where now listen we've got to press
[1:35:33] Beyond those
[1:35:35] divisions what do you mean by that I
[1:35:37] what I'm talking about pressing on
[1:35:39] divisions is that even being that much
[1:35:41] more intentional of saying when somebody
[1:35:44] comes on your heart call them send them
[1:35:46] a
[1:35:48] text I'll just wait and see them at
[1:35:50] church shame on you

[1:36:21] Satan wanted to so bring barriers and
[1:36:23] division if there's ever a time we need
[1:36:26] one another it's right
[1:36:28] now to encourage one
[1:36:32] another Hallelujah say brother I'm

[1:38:14] these things so what do we do we take
[1:38:16] away the
[1:38:17] stone Glory let me end with this one
[1:38:25] the Bible says Paul mentioned this when
[1:38:27] he
[1:38:28] was leading song service so I said well
[1:38:32] I'm going to have I'll go have to go
[1:38:34] ahead and I have to mention it was
[1:38:35] already in my notes from but I said I'm
[1:38:37] going have to mention it when Jesus was
[1:38:39] in the ship and he told him get in the
[1:38:42] boat we're going to the other
[1:38:45] side they got in the boat that day I
[1:38:47] wonder if they might have thought they
[1:38:48] were going to have a nice outing
[1:38:51] right maybe they had a nice picnic lunch
[1:38:53] and they was going to go out there and
[1:38:55] enjoy
[1:38:56] themselves but a storm
[1:39:00] arose an
[1:39:02] unexpected
[1:39:04] event don't you just love those things
[1:39:07] that are unexpected that put a kink in
[1:39:10] your
[1:39:11] plans no we
[1:39:13] don't I answer for all of you no we
[1:39:17] don't we become like rabbit on wiy the
[1:39:19] pool what do I do
[1:39:21] there had been a there had been you know
[1:39:24] it was so orderly on things this has to
[1:39:26] be done this has to be done this has to
[1:39:27] be done oh my goodness what do we
[1:39:32] do but we're going to go to the other
[1:39:34] side and I'm just going to say this
[1:39:36] we're going in the Rapture
[1:39:39] amen we're going in the Rapture amen and
[1:39:43] we're going to overcome all along the
[1:39:47] way I don't know what the storms are I
[1:39:49] don't know there's storms that we have
[1:39:51] just heard about that we have had
[1:39:53] requests for right
[1:39:56] here I think as I I stood here
[1:40:00] yesterday early afternoon and in prayer
[1:40:04] I'd received one text then I received
[1:40:06] another even of another situation where
[1:40:09] a sister was taken to the emergency
[1:40:13] room I just I already made at that point
[1:40:16] I just had sat down and started to
[1:40:17] listen to another message and I just I
[1:40:19] text the brother back I said look I said
[1:40:21] I'm going to pray right now I just got
[1:40:22] up out of the office came right over
[1:40:24] here I said Lord here we have reports
[1:40:27] all around us and I hadn't even heard
[1:40:29] about sister Ruth I didn't hear about
[1:40:30] that till I got home last
[1:40:32] night there's reports all around
[1:40:37] us but you're
[1:40:40] faithful you Lord you permitted you knew
[1:40:43] all these things sure that's right
[1:40:45] you're the god to see us through it all
[1:40:47] that's
[1:40:48] right yes sir and there's there's more
[1:40:51] than just that right there there's other
[1:40:53] needs that may not be something of
[1:40:55] physical or that may have terminal
[1:40:56] attached next to it but there's other
[1:40:58] needs that's here
[1:41:02] present but I want you to
[1:41:04] think brother Bram just takes it like
[1:41:07] this and he says it in the manner when
[1:41:09] he talks of that
[1:41:10] account they were on the sea and this is
[1:41:14] what's very
[1:41:15] important he was already in their
[1:41:19] ship
[1:41:21] that's good if he's not in your ship you
[1:41:23] want to get him in your
[1:41:25] ship that that's that's very important
[1:41:27] you don't want to start off without him
[1:41:30] you don't want to start off without him
[1:41:31] cuz there's two accounts right one
[1:41:34] account they started off without him the
[1:41:37] other account which is the one I'm
[1:41:38] referring to right
[1:41:40] now is they had to go wake him
[1:41:43] up he was present that's good but they
[1:41:46] had to wake him
[1:41:47] up you know brother brand says that in
[1:41:50] the he says it in the the message he
[1:41:52] says when you've went to the doctor and
[1:41:55] he says the doctor has says there's
[1:41:57] nothing else that can be done he said
[1:42:00] for your cancer for your arthritis for
[1:42:02] your nervous trouble he goes through a
[1:42:05] whole list of
[1:42:06] things right he says when the doctor has
[1:42:09] said all of that he said but you've got
[1:42:11] to
[1:42:12] remember who is it that has healed
[1:42:16] leukemia who is it that has healed you
[1:42:19] in the past
[1:42:21] who is it that has delivered you
[1:42:24] before see look back and remember he's
[1:42:29] still the same
[1:42:32] God he's still in the
[1:42:35] ship what must we do wake
[1:42:39] Jesus gowake
[1:42:41] Jesus Hallelujah because all it takes is
[1:42:45] for him to step forward and to speak to
[1:42:49] the storm amen yes
[1:42:54] amen amen I think I just just want to
[1:42:57] close them that point of
[1:42:59] it I think of the things here
[1:43:02] just I'd seen one of the services that
[1:43:04] brother Donnie had ministered right
[1:43:06] after sister
[1:43:08] Erica good and
[1:43:11] uh one thing that I look at is within
[1:43:15] it his sister Erica passed but cancer
[1:43:19] didn't take her amen
[1:43:24] same thing with those some one some one
[1:43:27] one brother that maybe some some of you
[1:43:28] know he was very dear friend to us here
[1:43:30] at the church and other places with
[1:43:32] Brother Steve
[1:43:34] Johnson cancer didn't take
[1:43:37] him it was it was brother Steve's time
[1:43:39] to go right that's right the same thing
[1:43:42] with sister Erica now that don't make
[1:43:44] sense to
[1:43:47] us are you hearing me it doesn't make
[1:43:50] sense right but yet what I say within
[1:43:54] all of that I really appreciate it well
[1:43:57] to me to me the
[1:43:58] testimony that when as brother Donnie
[1:44:01] came with that right there he says I'm
[1:44:03] still going to pray for everyone with
[1:44:07] cancer that comes to be prayed for and
[1:44:10] I'm going to believe God even more
[1:44:16] nowall because God's word Can't Fail
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:21] I tell you friends we're we're we're not
[1:44:24] defeated we're not
[1:44:28] defeated we're more than
[1:44:31] conquerors and it matters what we say to
[1:44:35] these things
[1:44:36] amen I say oh God let it be the
[1:44:39] testimony out of our
[1:44:42] life all is well
[1:44:44] Amen Let It Be the testimony even now
[1:44:49] even now Hallelujah
[1:44:51] whatever whatever it is even
[1:44:54] now all is well how can you say all is
[1:44:58] well because I've met the God who
[1:45:01] changed my life I know I'm in his
[1:45:04] presence how shall he not freely give us
[1:45:06] all things he knows what we have need of
[1:45:10] what shall we say to these things I say
[1:45:14] by his stripes I'm
[1:45:16] Healed Hallelujah I don't just say that
[1:45:19] for you brother Bill I say that for
[1:45:21] sister Ruth Hoyer prise God I'm telling
[1:45:24] you right now we received that report
[1:45:26] yesterday I'm not thinking about funeral
[1:45:29] prise
[1:45:31] godall I know those are words sometimes
[1:45:33] that can literally sometimes when it
[1:45:35] comes it can literally just shake
[1:45:40] you but there's a
[1:45:42] God on the
[1:45:45] inside there's a God who provides us
[1:45:48] with sufficient strength in that
[1:45:51] moment to be able to say all is
[1:45:58] well guarantee if we could do a FaceTime
[1:46:00] call with sister Ruth here today and put
[1:46:03] her on the screen right now we could ask
[1:46:05] her and say is all well with your family
[1:46:07] she'd say all is well if we ask sister
[1:46:10] Ruth is all well with you and brother Ed

[1:47:24] is and that who is the
[1:47:27] devil but who can be against us if God

[1:48:04] these
[1:48:06] things oh but they're they're going so
[1:48:08] far away everything they're doing is so
[1:48:11] contrary to the word let me remind you
[1:48:15] the two boys who were in the corner
[1:48:16] sister Hatty Wright Sons were laughing
[1:48:19] at what the Prophet was
[1:48:21] Sav brother Bram brings out the details
[1:48:24] of it and high I've heard but now I
[1:48:26] see oh brother Samuel They're laughing
[1:48:29] at me h brother BR said God can take the
[1:48:32] critic out of a service right here today
[1:48:36] and change that person's life he said
[1:48:37] and they'll be testifying tomorrow
[1:48:39] night that's the God yes sir he's a god
[1:48:43] of paradoxes hallelujah what shall we
[1:48:46] say to these things what shall we say I
[1:48:50] said say don't let our testimony be
[1:48:52] negative that's
[1:48:54] right Hallelujah that's right hallu
[1:48:57] let's look to him these needs that we
[1:49:00] have Among Us right here in our own

[1:49:20] assembly that we would pray for one
[1:49:22] another individuals as I said before
[1:49:25] where we I say God if there's one thing
[1:49:27] that we can even look at this Lord help
[1:49:30] us to break Beyond even bar barriers

[1:49:35] encourage one another I know some there
[1:49:39] might be something that seems a little
[1:49:40] natural but listen let's break beyond
[1:49:44] that because Jesus said to Martha take
[1:49:46] away the stone but both of them rolled
[1:49:49] away the the
[1:49:51] stone somebody might just need a little
[1:49:53] bit

[1:50:03] sends
[1:50:04] it send a little sometimes just a little
[1:50:07] text a little little something that'll
[1:50:09] come along the way God knows he knows
[1:50:11] what we have need of yes and let me I
[1:50:14] said that tonight as I told on myself
[1:50:16] don't allow the enemy to tell you you're
[1:50:18] going to be a bother to something

[1:50:51] everything because certainly we know
[1:50:54] things come just as they are now but God
