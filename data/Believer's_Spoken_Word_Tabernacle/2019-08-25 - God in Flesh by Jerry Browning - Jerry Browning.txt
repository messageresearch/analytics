Sheehan you can have your seats here for a moment amen I'm just so glad to be in the house of the Lord amen it's just it's such a Liberty and a joy to serve the Lord isn't it they met he really he really is our life you know it's something that our desire is we're not just you know we were in devotion the other night there at the house and a statement was made and it just you know how it is sometimes a statement is made and it just jumps out to you and you know we're not just we're not just believing on him we're serving him there's a great difference you can believe whatever a doctor says and a doctor can say this and that you could say that that's true you know and they tell you you need to stop doing this and stop doing that you say I believe that and then you go out and you know you get your value mill and everything else you're not serving it there's a difference between believing and serving but when you really believe it you serve amen and I'm so thankful that that service it's not left just to our strengths but he gives us power for service amen aren't you glad for that amen he ignites and gives faith to us so we're just thankful to the Lord I want to I just want to say on behalf of my wife and Paul and the family we certainly appreciate each of you that were able to to make it yesterday to the graduation party and the other thing I want to say that we're just thankful for each and every one that you didn't have to but you you helped out those getting there early and setting up and the different ones that that pitched in with different things to do and we we just so appreciate that I guess the one good thing about it is thank the Lord well I've got two years before the next one you are gonna graduate lay hands suddenly on no man but give you a little time to save up again for it too so we just just thankful to the Lord for that I want to say even for all the graduates that's here we've got a lot of graduates from college in and others from high school this year and just it's just a wonderful achievement I want you to understand that I've mentioned that before a few times but it's just a wonderful achievement amen that that has been done amen in your life and we want to say we're proud of you very proud of you because there's a lot of work [Applause] and I also want to mention there's a couple things here there's two things out there on the prayer request table and one of it is is there's a card for brother John la Fontaine and brother John la Fontaine I mentioned it during the prayer meeting here on Tuesday night and some of you probably have seen it posted on the internet but for brother John lefante they've diagnosed him with stage 4 cancer but we're believing the promise and that's what brother that's what brother John is standing up on that and you know brother John when you see the video so it's nothing that he would get anything new for me but brother John said I just want you understand I don't need the words of sympathy he said I don't need homemade remedies or feeling sorry for me he said I've got a promise got a promise so you know and you all know brother John he can he can say that in that way and you know because sometimes when you look at something like that you you know we're looking at a promise we're not looking at trying to make arrangements well I'm gonna go pick out my casket or anything like that no we've got a promise we've got a promise and we've got multiple promises where God had declared his healing power over and over and over so we have a card out here if you would if you wouldn't mind just signing the card if you have a testimony please write it on the paper there's paper that's out there or if you don't feel like there's enough room to write all the chapters you can type out an email send it into the library sister Will's aunt could get that printed off and then we can get all that sent we want to be able to send the car just of an encouragement to brother John and just just a note of what of what his ministry has meant to you over the years is that Alright amen and so you know it was a brother here in the church said yeah a scripture here a little while back and you know I've preached from that scripture and looked about it and I think it was a brother ray I think it was you sent me this text it was dealing with sacrifice and it talked about forgetting out of the book of Hebrews I believe to communicate for with such sacrifices God is well pleased and sometimes it is a sacrifice to communicate can you say Amen I'm gonna talk about when we need something I'm talking about to be able just to communicate with somebody else just to encourage them so we want to remember that also the there's a wedding invitation out there for brother Brian and sister Mariah's wedding and there is a sign-up sheet that is out there the invitation has the address for the reception as well as where the wedding will take place and that's on November 9th on the paper if you'll put down your name if you're planning on attending the name the name of the family and then the number of persons that would be coming in the family so if you that'll be out there for a little little right both of those things on the prayer request table the other thing is is Lord willing here at the end of the service I know that many of you is any kids went back to school yet okay okay yeah can we have some had some other teachers okay so at the end of a threat at the end of the after the ministering of the word this morning we want to have prayer over those that are going back to school colleges and different things the teachers as well as I know we have teachers and I appreciate all that as well there's a lot of work there and we just I believe with all of my heart that God is watching over us I don't say those words loosely I say them because it is the truth when when the Hebrew children went into the fiery furnace they went into the midst of that fire that fire was set to destroy him but they went in there and God met him there and when they came out of there there wasn't a smell the Bible says not one fray of their clothing was planted they didn't even smell like the pollution of smoke and the Bible says in Revelations 9 that those demonic powers have been released and it's smoke that has come out demonic demonic forces have been released Satan has been released here upon this earth but if he's been released guess who's also come down the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is here in the fullness of his word and of his spirit and he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world amen so don't fear Esther you're placed here for such a time as this and God is faithful amen who watches over so we're gonna have prayer here at the end of the service over those that would be going I want to say we appreciate brother Jerry I appreciate him being here this morning we just want God to come and just anoint that chip of a diamond of a gift that God has placed in our brother's life the Holy Spirit have come down put that up on the record of God's Word and the Holy Spirit will bring out of that record of God's Word and bring it present right before us and discerns the very thoughts and intents of the heart and ministers to us what we have need of amen I'm expecting that this morning once you a man could we stand are you gonna sing you all have had to exercise this morning some y'all didn't even stand you god bless you this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your presence Lord that's here with us Lord for how you've blessed in the worship Father bless your people now we ask Lord for you to come and anoint us Lord God open the pages of the word Lord and make them live to us Lord we ask for your guidance you know and the needs of the people asked your God that you will anoint us the world with a bill to be able to help and encouragement strengthen to the people in Jesus name Amen turn your Bibles to John chapter 1 verse 14 now we know in John chapter 1 and verse 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now we want to read from John 1:14 and it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glorious the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth Amen you may be seated what I'd like to speak on today is God in flesh now you know how could it be the blood of God God has no blood but yet there was a sacrifice that needed to be made in order for us to be redeemed so God created the blood brother Brennan says he created the blood cells you know the blood cells comes from the male and you take a chicken if the if the hen has never been with the rooster why she can lay her eggs but they'll rot she can set on him and set on him and set on him and and put him in the right atmosphere but those eggs will never hatch because there's there's no life in them they've never been Germanized LeBron said that's what's wrong a lot of times in the church we got a bunch of eggs sitting there there's never been germanized and so he said we need to clean out the nest and start over but God created the blood cells and formed this flesh cells in Mary he had God had to to come in order to be tempted like we are to be tested like we are and he couldn't do that in the spirit he in order to be able to do that he had to come down in flesh and so he created this the blood cells and the body the flesh cells and Mary and then a child was born and it had to come as a child because it had to come the same way we came just not by sex and so but it had to be born in flesh like our flesh it had to be born in flesh that would rolled it had to be born in flesh that could feel tiredness that could feel hunger that could feel temptations brother Branham said he even had to be tempted in sexual things then he had in he had to be in flesh like we are in order to be tested in tempted and tried and in these ways because otherwise he couldn't have been the author of our faith he couldn't he couldn't do this in spirit so he had to come down in flesh so we know that God came down in the flesh of Jesus Christ and he suffered all these things but at the same the same time that it was God in flesh it had to be man in order to be kinsmen to us it had to be flesh man that's a beautiful type in the book of ruth of how that and they only you know went into the country of mold and there her sons married and she had two daughter-in-laws her sons died her husband died and and she had her two daughter-in-laws and she told him said go back to your people i've got nothing left for you and of course root says that she wouldn't return back she says your people will be my people your God will be my god wherever you Lodge our lodge wherever you sleep that's where I'll sleep wherever you're buried I'll be buried there and so then we see the beautiful type of Boaz as the kinsman redeemer as he comes out and takes off his shoe and and makes a public Proclamation before all the people that he was redeeming what they only had laws redeeming back her estate and he had to rein in redeeming the woman he gained a bride and so Jesus Christ came and he made a public display of being beaten of being whipped of being locked of being crucified a public display of shedding his blood that he could redeem the church in order to get a bride when he died on Calvary and he cried my God my God why hast thou forsaken me that was a man that was a man that had felt that part of God lift from him because God couldn't die but Jesus had to die as man would die he had to give his life so he was man when he said that but then on Easter morning when he rose and he had the keys of death and of Hell that was more than a man that was my god that was God in flesh when he walked here on earth and he felt virtue go from him when the woman touched His garment he felt virtue leave him that was a man when I often told my wife when I preached I said it doesn't take as much out of me to preach as it does to pray for people it takes more it did it really as a drain on my body praying for people and it's Jesus as a man had to fill that drain of that virtue but that it healed that woman and stopped her blood flow that was God gyrus remember gyrus came to Jesus said his daughter was definitely sick and while he was talking one of the servants came and said she's died don't bother don't trouble the master any longer and gyrus is heart how much says the father his heart must have sank but jesus said fear not but only believe and see the glory of God and so he goes to gyrus house and there lays the girl and he said she's not dead she just sleeps and the Bible said those that were present there and laughed him to scorn and you know what he did with all those unbelievers he put him out he wasn't there to put on a show before them God don't put on a show or act for anybody so he put him out and once he put him out well then he been that he could he could touch into another realm and in another realm could tap into another language and could speak and say Tibbett da which means daughter arrives taking her by the hand and there she was in that spirit land she lays she was dead she had done patched into the spirit lamp but his voice spoke and reached into that spirit land and pulled her back and brought her to life that was God in flesh that was my god he was a man when he came down off the mountain he felt hunger when he had preached to the people and he felt tired but when he took five loaves and two fish and fed 5,000 people that was more than a man and I often remember my dad preaching on that and he would say he didn't just multiply the fish in the loaves he said but it was baked bread it was cooked fish that was more than a man a man couldn't do that and I just wonder you know he went and he taught in the temple He healed the sick the lame walk the Deaf heard the dumb spoke the blind received her sight the dead was raised how could people around him not see that that was God in flesh but yet even the priest out of the temple could not recognize that this was the Messiah they had this wasn't like that it should have been unheard of with them they they were looking for a messiah to come but they had took down through the years and through their ministry had riche made an image of what they thought he would come like and when he came it didn't match the imagery that they had in their mind because he came as a child because he came in a way to where evil could be spoke of him to wear that they said that his mother Mary had been with the soldiers or something and that he was born illegitimate he coming away dead to them was not prestigious they weren't expecting a child but he had to come as a child because he had to redeem our bodies and to redeem our bodies he had to come in these bodies and why couldn't they recognize him for in him dwelleth all Nisour the Godhead bodily you wonder why they couldn't why they couldn't look and see these things jesus said if you don't believe me believe the works he came from heaven he was going back to heaven Judith came from Hell he was going back to hell Jesus it was deity in flesh Jesus would be returning back to take the born-again with him friends I'm gonna tell you something Satan's waiting for his - he's waiting for his children - remember when Jesus hung on the cross was dying as I said as a man there was a thief on either side of him the one says if thou be the son of God and save yourself and save us - there was that question if if you me you know if you be a divine healer than heal this person then do this to prove it I don't have to prove anything to unbelievers God proves himself to his own children but that's because they're believers and they will accept that they will believe it but the world can see it happen and witness it with their own eyes and still not believing that's why they couldn't recognise God in flesh when Jesus walked here on the sea shores of Galilee they seen the things he done they ought to know and that man couldn't have done those things but their eyes was blind you wonder would you being able to tell that it was God in flesh if you would have been there brother man says how are you now because how you are now is how you would have been then if you're believer now you would have been a believer then if you can see God in flesh today you would have seen God in flesh then Jesus says in John chapter 10 verse 25 I told you you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you're not of my sheep as I told you my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me can you say praise the Lord I'm so glad that I know his voice I'm so glad that I can recognize the voice of God among all the voices that are in the world today among all the voices there that are surrounding this this entire message that we claim to believe all the voices that do all of that we can recognize the true voice of God and the voice of God wasn't silenced when brother Branham left the scene we still have the voice with us today and my sheep know my voice and a stranger will not follow he said I give unto them eternal life do you know what that means that means OE God's own life I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no one is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and I and my father are one there he was proclaiming it with his own voice I'm God in flesh and you know what it caused among them instead of them recognizing and looking at the works and seeing the things you know what he calls to them they picked up stones to stone him and he said for what good work do you stone me what good works I'll show you my father of which of these do you stone me now I want to move a little closer look with me if you would in Luke chapter 17 Luke chapter 17 verse 26 through 30 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed I know these things I'm going to speak at this point if you've been around this message in any time at all you know them but I look around and I see a lot of faces I don't recognize of course I'm not here all the time so I'm not going to recognize everybody but I don't know who all where you're at in this and so I felt led to bring some of these things out as it was in the days of lot in the days of lot when Sodom was going to be burned there was three that came and visited Abraham in the plains of Mamre and when they came remember just about four or five days before this Abraham's name had been Abram and it had been Sarai just about four or five days before that these three men came to visit Abraham but there was one that stayed with Abraham while the other two went down to Sodom to get lot out of Sodom and that one that was standing there he didn't say he didn't call him Abram he said Abraham he didn't say Sarah he said Sarah where is Sarah your wife surely that the one who had changed Abraham's name was the one that was standing before it because his name had just been changed about five days prior to that and he stood there and then with his back to the door of the tent you know he said I'm going to visit Sarah about the time of life and she's going to have a son that's going to be born to you and the Bible said that Sarah laughed within her heart stirred me an old woman have pleasure with my Lord in him an old man and there was just back to the quarter tent and look that wasn't a myth it was a man because he had sat there and eat meat and bread with Abraham and had drank milk it was a man but it was God in flesh floor it wasn't it theophany if the apne doesn't need to eat the God had come down Edel him had come down in flesh stood there with his back to the door of the tent and said why did Sarah laugh and that was the last sign that was given before the promised son would arrive it was the last sign given before Sodom was destroyed and that was promised to happen again as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the days when the Son of Man is revealed we were to receive a sign and it's the last sign that was to be given to the bride before the coming of the promised son I want to read some things some excerpts out of some different messages and I know that you that here you listen to the messages of brother Branham that you no doubt you hear these things but just for for everyone just to hear them I feel red LED to read them but here where the Branham says this little lady sitting here little white thing on like that if you got a prayer card are you sick are we strangers to one another God knows us both there's a light over that woman if you can see it's circling right above her she's praying is that right you know you have not a chance to come up here but you are praying because I can just see just below that there's a dark shadow it's death the woman's shadow of death yes cancer you believe God can heal you it's cancer of the breast I see a doctor looking at it and he tells you that he's going to try to operate in Europe for an operation and I see you walk up from the platform or something you're a preacher you're a woman preacher that's thus saith the Lord is that right lady what he said was that right stand to your feet if that's right do you believe can you discern the facts the same Jesus that touch the woman touched His garment it's not me it's him I don't know the woman she don't know me but God knows us both now you tell me how a man could stand there and tell this woman what was wrong with her and then say I see a doctor talking to you and it's breast cancer and he's going to he wants to perform surgery on you and he not only sees all that and says she's healed but then he says I see you going up to a platform how could a man see these things unless you'd be God [Applause] says here again he says I see a lady in a vision she's praying she's a young woman she said right here it's something about a baby see oh it's a miscarriage that's what it was a dead baby she's from Kentucky her name is Martin why are you miss Martin yeah with yellow dress that is that true is that it ladies stand on your feet of soul I don't know the one but God knows here and there she is blessed be the name of the Lord right behind her sits a lady she's got him noise she's got trouble in her right side kind of a heavyset woman with a black looking dress on I just want to stop here a moment and just and just say something about how much God cares I don't know if you know if you're a ready age at some point or other you may have had hemorrhoids and they're not fun there ain't nothing fun about them ain't nothing Pleasant about I mean nothing good about it and it's embarrassing but here God cared enough about this woman that had hemorrhoids hemorrhoids ain't nothing you're going to die from but I'll tell you what you'll feel like you're dying but God cared enough to say you've got hemorrhoids and now she's healed I'll tell you the worst thing about hemorrhoids is recovering from the surgery this woman didn't have to have surgery it's just gone removed by the power of God he said she's got trouble on the right side kind of a heavyset woman with the black dress on you got a prayer card lady you don't have you don't need it do you believe you have faith to touching something you never touched me you touched him all right then raise up your hand with your handkerchief and accept your healing go home and be well in the name of Jesus looky here there sits a little lady back here with a checkered looking dress on she's got her head bow she's praying for her father she's got liver trouble you believe the Lord will heal you sister you believe it then you have it lady you were awful kind to tell her that it was her the reason you said that was because the Holy Spirit was moving right over you - that's right you have a prayer card you don't you don't need one you're praying for a mother you're thinking I'm bringing her to church tomorrow night you don't have to do it lay hands on her and call on the name of the Lord Jesus she'll get well if you believe that what he was saying you don't have to bring her to me just lay hands on him believe she'll be healed he's showing something there see we can see God in the Prophet but he's telling her you go lay hands on her [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah I challenge your

feet god bless you go home be well your faith has saved you that's the same Jesus that's the same angel have you got discernment to discern delay at the Lord's body do you believe I'm telling you the truth you believe that Christ is giving witness of it if you believe that raise your hands and how many believers are in here that will shake their hands like this then you believe me as God's prophet don't doubt me a bit take those hands that you're waving towards God and lay on somebody next to you and you'll see the glory of God that's all he can do then you discern the Lord's body can you discern that his spirit is here these signs shall follow them that believe that they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover Lord God creator of heavens and earth author of everlasting life makes Satan turn loose every believer in here they've got their hands laid on one another and they are believers they are having faith in God that they believe that you'll do it Oh Lord your words cannot fail no more than your promises and your promises was if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover now Satan you foul demon of oppression that's beating these people down in the dust I buried in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God that you turn them loose and come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] says now lay your hands on one another and pray the prayer of faith and when you feel the Spirit of God discern that it is God's promise to you every one that can feel that God's power is moving in you so it wasn't just God's goal wasn't just to be God in the prophet but here he's showing him it's God in the people he lay hands on one another it's God when you feel his power moving through you [Music] the Bible said that in the last days right at this time before the coming of the Lord there to be a spirit come on the earth in veiled and human flesh man like it was at Sodom and would be able to discern the thoughts of the mind like that angel did there as he was in the days of Sodom how many understands that just raise your hands Alleluia do you believe that pardon me turn with me to first John chapter 4 first John chapter 4 begin reading at verse 2 everybody know you the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus is coming the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of the Antichrist where of you've heard it shout should come even now already is in the world year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world [Applause] how many believes the word is eternal so how the how the word was wrote when the Holy Spirit moves on his men to ride it it was wrote in a certain way for a reason and when John wrote this down he didn't say every spirit that confesses not that Jesus has come in the flesh but is present tense come in the flesh this was after Jesus had died this is after he rose this is after he had ascended he was gone off the scene and now what it was it was his believers his followers and John saying every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God where the brandon said when he turned his back to the audience and called people out he said it's LOM in flesh again just like he was at the days in the days of Abraham it's L of him back in the bride human flesh again in the last days doing the same thing notice he didn't he didn't say it's Elohim in me he said it's L o him in the bride because that didn't change when brother Branham left to see I think there's a lot of people today that think that once the brother ray left the scene that ended it but it's not that wasn't God's total purpose if it had it been then he wouldn't have took brother Branham off the scene like he did but he took brother Branham off the scene because he wanted you to be able to see God in you in yourself [Applause] [Music] who says here in the spoken words original seed notice what harmony Jesus never did anything until seen of the father where the father showed him first harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for it the seed be planted the water will rise it up again amen then I got a great big hallelujah here's the secret the word is in the bra and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word the word is in the Bott it wasn't just that it was going to be in the Prophet and it wasn't just the Prophet knows what God wanted done with the word but he said it's in the bride and the bride knows what he was done with or people that only believe in playing tapes they're missing out they don't believe in the fivefold ministry they're missing out that same God that spoke through the Prophet is the same table that's here today he's the same God that speaks through the fivefold ministry today preparing this ride to go on the rapture brother Branham said say what I said not play what I said he said say what I said giving authority to the new to the ministry tell the people what I said Jesus told Peter he says when you converted strengthen the brother the word is in the bride the mine of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she doesn't in his name she has thus saith the Lord then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit waters it until he grows and serves his purpose they do his will a man I believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord or they'll keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet God wasn't just here to heal through brother branham i-i've you know sometimes people think all mine I've got this sickness I didn't look like it just been back there in that time and got into prayer honor had him call me out that was a sign that was a sign that's what it was meant for and brother branham continuously turned around and said you lay hands on one another you pray for him you take this prayer cloth you lay it on them these signs shall follow them to believe hallelujah it was a sign but the same God that healed the people there is the same God today that heals people today and it's it's not any power that I possess as far as a man but you know God uses men let me say this yesterday I was talking over at the graduation gathering that they had for Paul and I was standing there talking to sister Betsy and she was saying how God healed her when I was here the last time hildreth from depression I suffer from depression when she came up here to be prayed for I knew how to get ahold of God to be to understand what she was feeling what she was going through God allows those things sometimes God healed her I told my wife I said I've suffered from anxiety I said I had people come up to be prayed for that were suffering from anxiety and God healed them that wasn't me but that's the same God that was here when brother Branham was here the same God that was in flesh then is in flesh today but there's people that will look at you it's not just God in the flesh the ministry it's not in the bride it's God in you and there'll be people that are around you every day and they won't be able to recognize that it's God in flesh in front of them again but they'll have no excuse on the day of judgement because God will have a manifested himself in the by why do you think these people come to us when they've got a means they have your church pray for me they've witnessed that God answers the prayers here I had someone come a few years ago to the church and they had got married to a young man that used to come to our church that our back slid and him and her came back and she was dying of cancer and she come up to be prayed for and I prayed for her then I went down to the hospital with them that that week and I prayed with her before the doctors went back to they were going to take some more imagery of where the cancer was and I prayed with her again they took her back there and the doctors came out after the story said we can't find it I said I understand it was there but now it's gone now you would think would something like that happened that that individual would realize that that was God and this God healed them like that that they would do everything they could to surrender their life to God but they didn't they left right back out of the church and turned around and said some very foul things concerning me why couldn't they recognize that it was God in flesh but there's people that won't recognize that you are God in flesh today it's Jesus working through you it's his wife you know I had people say oh I can't live it like sister so-and-so well that's because you need to get saved my sister Sola so you need to get filled with the Holy Ghost because I said she couldn't leave any live it either if it wasn't for having dogs life in her [Applause] brother Brennan said talking about the bride tree he said the same life that was in the bridegroom is in the bride tree and it can't bear fruits without her so it had to be the same life in the bride tree the same lie that sin God is the same light that's in you you can't no more die than God can die this body can die but you'll never die I told my mom I said the other day I don't know I just got to thinking about my dad and I got to wondering what he looked like and you know I can go to pictures of him when he was a young man but yet I still wonder what is he exactly look like there now but I knew one thing he didn't look like he did when he left here when I was growing up there was a time specially as a teenager you know how teenagers go through those those stages you know and it used to really irritate me because people would say are you brother brownies son and I would say I got a name and you know I kind of wanted to be known for me I wanted people to know me for me not just know me as brother browning son let's be honest sometimes when people would find out as brother in law your brother browning son my kids couldn't testify to that but friends back in 1982 when we were starting this work and I watched my dad how that God was in him and how God led him and I saw him when he had just when people thought he were wrong he was wrong and he had this felt like he had to stand alone I remember different ministers when he was first starting out he would invite different ministers you know he wanted to come and they would they were kind of standoffish and wouldn't come but God has proven this way but as I watched him friends I saw a real man and after that when somebody was asking me who I was I didn't say well I'm Jerry Brown and I said I'm brother brownies boy you know James Brown and I'm his son I wanted to be identified with you and that's the way it is with the Bride of Christ we're not looking for our own identity we want to be identified with him brother Branham says when a woman marries a man disagreeing with him it'll just be some kind of a fuss continuously but when a man and his wife is girlfriend has a spouse when they are in perfect harmony like one soul in one mind because they're going to be one flesh then when the church can get in such a harmony with God until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they're going to be why the message of Christ and mystery of God revealed values now you can see now the endtime message why it's rejected can you now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery see no denomination the revelation God is not known by denomination he's known by revelation look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh my god made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing out bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed no sir but she's coming back with the pure unadulterated Word of God being manifested I hope every man that hears this tape every woman will understand that see she is a second Eve but she's not breaking and spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband she'll stay with this word regardless of what anybody says you can have all the XQ mean to compose you want and all the affiliations she stays with the word where the word manifests today I think of that little story that brother Bentham tells about that little boy that was afraid of the storm you know and his mom was trying to assure him not to be afraid of the storm and said you know God's watching out over you and he's protecting from the storm but he didn't want his mommy to leave him and he said I want to God with some flesh on him you look around you you're seeing God with some flesh on there God's manifested in this bride in the same time and Friends he's getting us ready to leave this earth we've got we've already got our ticket I don't know what time the departure is yet but I know where we're going and I also know how long the flights gonna take brother damn Daisley used to say we're not taking an airplane ride we're taking a plane air ride I'm ready to leave out of here are you I'm looking for the coming of the Lord and you know I want to treat my brother and sister like that it is God in flesh I want to be careful how I treat them how I talk to them how I react I don't want my you know you if you'll let it your first your flesh will reactance over certain things I don't want that I don't want to react out of my emotions I've seen people take stands on certain things based on their emotions I'm not basing it on my emotions I believe in emotions I like liveliness I don't like things to be dead I always appreciate preaching here at this church less than for the Sam definitely father we thank you Lord for your words today Lord herdsmen Lord that we can see you and one another today Lord did you said by this job all men know that you're my servants that you have loved one for another and the Bible says how can you say you love God if you don't love your brother who how can you say you love God who you can't see if you don't love your brother who you can't see Lord the probably said there will come a time when the only love that will be left will be in the bride and we're seeing that Lord the perverse perversion in the world today Lord were seeing it in a sodomite condition Lord to where they are now Lord passing laws in different states Lord where it would prevent us Lord from even be able to hardly preach on Sodom preach on the cansada might condition Lord to say anything against homosexuality lord it would be against the law what they're wanting Lord is they want to come and try to infiltrate our churches the Lord I know before Lord that you allow that to happen you'll take us off this face of this earth but it's just showing the side of my condition that this world is him and it has to be in that condition dear God before you come but we know Lord dent there wasn't one drop of water that hit land until Noah and his family were safe in the ark Lord the Prophet said there wasn't one bit of fire that hit Sodom until lada been took until Abraham Lee said Abraham wasn't even down there he'd come out twenty-five years ago Lord there won't be one bond strike here there won't be one thing of destruction happened before the bride's touch I pray you bless your people today dear God I pray you'll bless the word to them in Jesus Christ's name Amen [Applause] you know I think it's just so much that was that was said but you know those of you listening to the message and if you're not gone into the message you seem to get interesting and remember this right here a person can set down and do Bible study after Bible study and even when we come here to hear the word as what was spoke this morning in the scripture just kept ringing through my heart flesh and blood have not revealed this unto you it takes the Holy Ghost it takes the Lord God to reveal his worth I want you to understand God desires to reveal himself to you that's what God desires to do there's a lot of people who carry a lot of big names in this world that don't know you they don't know me they could care less about us then what's your vote but they don't care about to get their vote to do what they want to do but very God who created this earth that we're standing there Saint God who made man in his own image in every star to hang in his position I'd say he is greater he's bigger then then whoever the most important person is seem to be in this world that same God would make himself so little to come down and speak to our hearts and move in our lives that's real greatness right there and to change us live inside of us I think God for that word it's a sign God gave a sign in this hour how we thank God for the sign knowing amen but to recognize what the sign was declaring to us in this hour that what God it was doing there and that same God is doing now he's the same yesterday and today and forever amen don't you love him amen

here on earth I said Sodom is here on earth there's a lot of things that are going on there's a lot of things coming into schools and there's a lot of things you read on the news but I'm gonna say it like this now Lord Jesus said to me and he said to you fear not he said it like this in the book of Matthew lo I with thee whether so ever thought Louis as he said to Joshua whether so ever about
