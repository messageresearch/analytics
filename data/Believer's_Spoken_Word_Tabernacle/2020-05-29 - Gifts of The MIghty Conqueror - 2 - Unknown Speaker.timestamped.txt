[30:39] don't you just love you that's so good
[30:43] to be in the house of the Lord so good
[30:46] to see each and every one of you and
[30:48] it's been certainly been nice over the
[30:50] over the time just being able to see you
[30:53] and it's not the same some of you have
[30:55] seen over video conference calls that
[30:58] we've had and you've had to look at my
[31:01] ugly face and you know but I've got to
[31:04] least see you then and but it's so nice
[31:07] to be able to see you in person and just
[31:10] we certainly love you and just really
[31:13] just appreciate you I can say by far but
[31:15] that wasn't indeed the hardest thing
[31:17] that for me that that I had during this
[31:19] time was not being able to see you all
[31:22] and so we're just we're here we're here
[31:24] tonight and those that are streaming is
[31:28] still at home we're gathered together
[31:31] around the word and we're just expecting
[31:33] just to receive something from the Lord
[31:35] that God would just speak to us in a
[31:38] personal way if you would let's open up
[31:40] in our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4 and
[31:43] we want to just begin there and read
[31:47] some verses of Scripture some things
[31:50] that we just kind of begin to look at
[31:54] again or begin to look at here last
[31:58] Thursday and starting into this in verse
[32:01] 4 of Ephesians 4 Paul would write by
[32:08] inspiration there is one body and one
[32:11] spirit even as you're called in one hope
[32:15] of your calling one Lord one faith one
[32:21] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[32:26] above all and through all and in you all
[32:29] but unto every one of us is given grace
[32:33] according to the measure of the gift of
[32:37] Christ
[32:38] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[32:41] on high he led captivity captive and
[32:45] gave gifts unto men
[32:47] I remember the scripture we looked at
[32:49] last week if Psalm 68 in in in in the
[32:53] prophecy that was spoken through David
[32:56] the scripture said he received against
[32:59] now here is in the mighty Conqueror as
[33:04] he's ascending back up now coming into
[33:07] position
[33:08] he is dispersing those gifts that he has
[33:11] received and he gave gifts unto men now
[33:16] that he ascended what is it but that he
[33:19] also descended first into the lower
[33:21] parts of the earth he that descended is
[33:24] the same also that ascended far above
[33:26] all heavens that he might fill all
[33:30] things and he gave some apostles and
[33:34] some prophets and some evangelists and
[33:36] some pastors and teachers amen may God
[33:40] bless you bless the reading of the word
[33:42] as you're being seated so I want to as
[33:48] we look here in the scripture and just
[33:50] continuing to take that part on gifts of
[33:54] the mighty Conqueror I want to just
[33:57] continue our our scripture here of
[33:59] Ephesians and looking at verse 12
[34:02] because what we've just read it
[34:05] expresses that of the gifts that he
[34:08] himself has given and remember these
[34:12] gifts the whole way that this would be
[34:14] portrayed is that when one had conquered
[34:18] another nation they would take that of
[34:21] the spoils they would take the riches
[34:23] and as they themselves were making their
[34:25] procession back into their homeland
[34:29] they were dispersing of gifts and
[34:32] valuable things and things that were
[34:34] that were spoils of the victory the
[34:38] things that they would release it was
[34:40] all declaring the victory that was
[34:43] already brought to those people and to
[34:47] think of it that the gifts that God has
[34:49] placed we
[34:50] in the church as well as every every
[34:55] member of the bride of Jesus Christ it
[34:58] is to display his victory now just let
[35:02] me just say it like this your life as we
[35:06] looking at that you may not have one of
[35:09] the five ministerial gifts that we just
[35:11] read and would focus upon here but to
[35:14] remember that in your life your life
[35:17] when you have received the Holy Ghost
[35:21] and God has done that work by the new
[35:24] birth your life is a trophy and a
[35:28] testament of his victory and he and this
[35:32] is where in your life it is now the life
[35:36] of the overcomer living through you and
[35:39] you are an overcomer he because it is
[35:43] his life that's living through you you
[35:45] see your life will preach many sermons
[35:48] that the these right here that I've read
[35:51] up that will never that will never reach
[35:53] or reach to different ones but a life
[35:56] that will preach a victory where a
[35:58] person can say you know maybe to a
[36:01] sister how was it that you how is it
[36:04] that you dress like this or how is it
[36:05] that you've let your hair grow and we
[36:07] know it's it's much deeper than that
[36:09] that reflects an inward work that has
[36:11] taken place but how is it and there is a
[36:14] life that can truly and genuinely be
[36:17] reflective of victory and the victory is
[36:20] the overcoming of our own will to wear
[36:23] that the will of God has set down upon
[36:26] the throne and he's reigning this is why
[36:29] the scripture would say that behold all
[36:31] things all things are passed away and
[36:33] behold all things have become new
[36:35] because it becomes a life that's under a
[36:38] new administration and it now is his
[36:41] victory that is being made manifest
[36:42] through our lives that's why Paul said
[36:45] no man that that that can call Jesus
[36:48] accursed no man can call him lord but by
[36:52] the holy ghost and see the Holy Ghost it
[36:55] gives an authority because you are a
[36:57] received of that victory in your life
[37:01] that you know that you have passed
[37:03] death unto life and it is his victory
[37:06] that has come and not just been
[37:08] announced but now his manifest through
[37:11] your life so every one of these the
[37:14] gifts they are gifts from the mighty
[37:16] Conqueror they are not gifts that have
[37:18] with any compromise at all these these
[37:22] gifts that we look at here in verse 12
[37:24] it goes into the purpose of this
[37:27] ministry because there's a purpose for
[37:29] it and that purpose is for the
[37:31] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[37:34] the ministry for the edifying of the
[37:36] body of Christ till we all come in the
[37:39] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[37:41] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[37:45] unto the measure of the stature of the
[37:48] fullness of Christ that we be that we
[37:51] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[37:55] and fro and carried about with every
[37:57] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[38:00] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[38:03] in wait to deceive but speaking the
[38:06] truth in love may grow up into him in
[38:09] all things which is the head even Christ
[38:12] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[38:14] together and compacted by that which
[38:17] every joint supplieth according to the
[38:20] effectual working in the measure of
[38:23] every part maketh increase of the body
[38:25] unto the edifying of itself in love let
[38:28] me just just for tonight let me just
[38:31] take all of those scriptures and
[38:33] summarize it in this way that every it
[38:36] is the objective and should be the goal
[38:38] for every individual that hears the
[38:42] gospel that they themselves desire to
[38:45] receive of that Liberty from which they
[38:48] are being called to and when receiving
[38:51] that Liberty that life also that they
[38:54] would grow and mature as I looked
[38:57] throughout this a building and you can
[38:59] even you know looking at one another we
[39:03] we grow and we change and this is kind
[39:06] of something whether we want to or not
[39:08] you grow and change you either lose hair
[39:10] you got to dye your hair you got to do
[39:13] something here things
[39:14] change about your life you grow right
[39:18] but this is the this is the objective of
[39:21] what God would set forth even the
[39:24] ministry so that he himself is the tutor
[39:27] of his church and it's him working
[39:30] through these five ministerial offices
[39:33] so that the church might come into that
[39:36] expression and grow and mature this is
[39:41] all he is working that day I'll be
[39:43] honest with you right now if they're
[39:45] read these scriptures and this was left
[39:47] up to my flesh or your flesh or any
[39:50] other flesh to fulfill we would be in
[39:52] trouble but it is not up to any man to
[39:55] fulfill these scriptures it's only as
[39:58] God has vessels that are able to be
[40:00] yielded to him and it's God
[40:03] accomplishing and achieving his own
[40:05] world so then the Scriptures bring it in
[40:09] here ah as we look at here in the
[40:12] scriptures that it says in first
[40:14] Corinthians 12 27 now ye are the body of
[40:18] Christ and members in particular and God
[40:22] hath set some in the church first
[40:24] apostles secondarily prophets thirdly
[40:26] teachers after that miracles then gifts
[40:29] of healings helps government's
[40:30] diversities of tongues you got to think
[40:33] when we look at this here we find in the
[40:37] scripture you find in in in in here
[40:42] within the scripture that here when the
[40:44] Ministry of the Son of Man has been
[40:46] opened up noticed the charge and
[40:49] commissioned in mark 16 is go you
[40:52] therefore into all the world you do not
[40:55] read in mark 16 the word pastor you do
[40:58] not worry read the word teacher you do
[41:02] not read the word evangelist but he says
[41:04] go you there forth which would be
[41:06] apostles are you with me because you see
[41:10] God does not give something unless
[41:13] there's a need for it if there wasn't
[41:16] churches that had already been
[41:17] established if there's not churches
[41:19] established there's no need for a pastor
[41:21] but once the church has been established
[41:23] then there's a need for a pastor
[41:27] and there's needs see all of these
[41:29] minister of gifts are based on the needs
[41:32] have God ministers to the needs of his
[41:35] body he is the husband of his church his
[41:39] church is his wife so he is the one to
[41:43] minister and to care for our needs and
[41:46] he has a way of doing that through each
[41:49] one of these offices now to think how
[41:52] that Paul would write and encourage um
[41:56] Timothy in this time he would write and
[41:59] speak to Timothy in first Timothy 4:14
[42:02] neglect not the gift that is in thee it
[42:06] means do not be careless with it or to
[42:09] as go to put it aside if God gave a gift
[42:13] he intends for that gift to be used
[42:17] God does not decorate his house with
[42:20] things like they do it some restaurants
[42:23] and they put rakes on the wall and
[42:25] they're just rakes on the wall and
[42:26] nobody use them that's not how God puts
[42:28] gifts in the church they're not to be
[42:30] looked at and then looked at and says oh
[42:32] my in that a wonderful gift no the gift
[42:34] is there for God to use to minister to
[42:37] our needs so this is how God he's a God
[42:41] of purpose and here how Paul would write
[42:44] neglect not the gift that is in thee and
[42:47] I can say it like this I would you know
[42:50] I could preach on this one here tonight
[42:52] for a long time but to realize that
[42:55] within it every one of us has a part
[42:58] within this body every one of us just as
[43:03] I heard the prophets say here just the
[43:05] other day he said someone could say he
[43:08] said like you know a kid at a house and
[43:10] say well you know it ain't my job to
[43:12] bring in the wood that suze job she
[43:14] always brings in the wood he said but if
[43:15] you see there's wood needed to be
[43:17] brought in
[43:17] then you're a part of that then you go
[43:19] and gather the wood and bring it in you
[43:22] see it's it's all a part of that it's
[43:24] how everything working together in
[43:27] coordination for one objective and that
[43:29] is Jesus Christ that he might be
[43:32] glorified we're not interested who gets
[43:34] the glory
[43:35] it should not be glory going to any man
[43:37] the glory should go back to the Lord
[43:40] Jesus Christ if any gift takes away from
[43:44] that
[43:45] then that gift is not right it's not in
[43:48] line it's not in order
[43:49] there should be no gift that draws
[43:52] people to itself the gift if it's
[43:57] properly placed and comes into its
[43:59] position around Christ as he's revealed
[44:03] in that hour that gift yielded is like
[44:06] the gold the frankincense and the myrrh
[44:08] it testifies of his presence on earth
[44:11] being revealed in that hour and it
[44:14] declares him for who he is
[44:17] so he said neglect not the gift that is
[44:20] in thee so you know those that seem
[44:23] special don't hang your harp on a willow
[44:25] tree
[44:27] now the same I think we're talking about
[44:29] ministering gift it is a gift come on
[44:31] now I mean you ain't been captured and
[44:34] taken into Babylon which was given thee
[44:38] by prophecy
[44:39] now remember given thee by prophecy it
[44:42] was not prophecy that placed it in
[44:44] Timothy's life prophecy itself only
[44:47] brought forth what God had already sown
[44:50] there with the laying on of the hands of
[44:53] the presbytery the hands of the
[44:56] presbytery that of their of the ministry
[44:58] the elders lay hands on timothy did not
[45:01] impart the gift into Timothy the laying
[45:04] on of hands were simply to recognize
[45:06] what had already come to fruition in
[45:10] Timothy's life and they are saying we
[45:13] agree that this gift lays here in this
[45:15] life hallelujah is not in parting gifts
[45:20] so here brother Branham you know he goes
[45:24] into this and he says now when we look
[45:28] at it he says I'm nothing I'm just your
[45:30] brother there's nothing to me but the
[45:32] Holy Spirit in predestination for then
[45:36] gives God has set in the church not what
[45:40] some elder laid his hands on God said in
[45:43] the church first apostles then prophets
[45:45] and so forth God set them in their their
[45:48] divine gifts for ordained of God God for
[45:55] our dinner
[45:56] God knew that they would be there just
[45:59] like he told with Jeremiah I ordained
[46:01] you to be a prophet in the foyer in your
[46:05] mother's room
[46:06] that gift was already laying there
[46:08] remember the scripture said gifts and
[46:10] callings are without repentance there
[46:13] can be lives that have gifts but is that
[46:15] gift intended to operate in the body of
[46:19] Jesus Christ
[46:19] let me just speak very plainly just
[46:21] because somebody was a preacher in a
[46:23] denomination do not mean that they are
[46:25] to preach to the bride of Jesus Christ
[46:29] now you with me just because somebody
[46:32] was a deacon here or a trustee there it
[46:35] doesn't mean that automatically when
[46:36] they're gonna be a deacon in the body of
[46:38] Jesus Christ or that no it doesn't mean
[46:40] that
[46:40] it's not just simply as something that's
[46:42] carried around it does does this come
[46:45] together to reflect the vision of Christ
[46:48] in this hour oh my I'll tell you great
[46:52] is the humility for one who is able to
[46:55] come and the word the manifestation of
[46:59] Jesus Christ means more to them than any
[47:01] gift in their life brother Ram goes on
[47:05] to say here in faith cometh by hearing
[47:07] look what he says here God set some in
[47:10] the church to dramatize okay let me just
[47:18] take you back it was a cool October
[47:21] evening and blind Bartimaeus sat next to
[47:24] the wall when brother Branham goes
[47:26] through that I don't know about you
[47:27] whether I'm in October or not
[47:29] I can feel that breeze it's gifted to be
[47:33] able to do that in a place to where you
[47:36] and I can come into that place right
[47:38] there some are set in order to dramatize
[47:42] think one brother band doing faith faith
[47:44] as a substance remember I asked for
[47:46] different people play the sound and they
[47:48] got their back turned this way did you
[47:50] smell it no did did you see it no but
[47:53] what was it well I heard it ah you heard
[47:55] it see he dramatized trying to bring
[47:57] those things up why would God even
[48:00] direct a man to do that because his love
[48:03] desires that his children would be
[48:06] edified God will go to great lengths to
[48:10] see that his word is godly
[48:13] oh I love that don't you he said notice
[48:17] he set some in the church to dramatize
[48:20] some to preach fiery sermons others to
[48:24] pray for the sick but all these gifted
[48:26] brothers there in the church for one
[48:29] purpose that's to unite the kingdom of
[48:32] God here on earth the Brotherhood
[48:35] so this ministry now the Lord Jesus
[48:39] Christ it's a call to true ones it's a
[48:43] call to the real grounds of true
[48:45] fellowship with God that's oneness with
[48:48] him his life in us and we in him that's
[48:51] what the ministry calls true in the
[48:54] ministry is a declaring that Liberty has
[48:59] come amen it declares Liberty has come
[49:04] now think about how that God has so
[49:07] coordinated that the body is one unit
[49:11] yet every part is needful and
[49:13] instrumental that we the example God
[49:17] gave us last week of how that the cells
[49:19] of my body need food but my cells can't
[49:22] go to the pantry and open it up and get
[49:24] it right my hands can't open up the
[49:27] pantry unless my feet get me there but
[49:31] even after I get the food I've got to
[49:34] have some teeth and I've got to be able
[49:35] to chew it then I've got to be able to
[49:39] swallow it there's got to be some
[49:40] digestive juices down there to bring it
[49:43] along and then there's got to be that of
[49:45] blood that's able to transport it into
[49:48] the cells and finally what the cells are
[49:50] calling for that ah but you see it's all
[49:55] part of the body it's one coordinated
[49:58] effort that's why brother Branham would
[50:00] take and he would speak in the two parts
[50:02] and humble thyself and he spoke of the
[50:04] third pool the operating of that word he
[50:07] said he will take all parts coordinating
[50:10] one with another and you know what that
[50:13] takes that takes a lot of sacrifice it
[50:16] takes down laying down ideas laying down
[50:18] opinions laying down thoughts it takes
[50:20] to where everybody's willing to lay down
[50:21] for one objective that's Jesus Christ
[50:24] and I'm glad that he's present to bring
[50:26] us into that place to where we get our
[50:29] eyes off of ourselves and our eyes are
[50:31] focused just on him we want to see him
[50:33] glorified oh I believe that's it well
[50:37] that's the work of the Holy Spirit
[50:38] working in our midst even now God has
[50:41] set has chosen and set this church in
[50:44] such a way that that that it could
[50:47] ever be just one office or one gift but
[50:50] rather it would be the Holy Ghost
[50:52] working through a mini membered body
[50:54] where the Spirit of God works through a
[50:56] great diversity to accomplish his work
[51:00] don't misunderstand me
[51:02] but this church cannot survive alone on
[51:03] my ministry let's say you're the pastor
[51:08] of this church that's true but it's just
[51:10] like with that not to get off on that
[51:12] part tonight but it's just to understand
[51:14] that you know what there's times when my
[51:17] children have needed braces or they need
[51:19] to go to the doctor guess what I'm not
[51:21] I'm not I'm not the guy whatever you
[51:22] call it that puts on the braces on the
[51:24] mouth or I'm not the guy that says here
[51:26] here's the blood pressure cuff let me
[51:28] check your blood pressure stick out your
[51:29] tongue now let me see if you got a sore
[51:31] throat no I take them to somebody who's
[51:34] able to address that God has specialist
[51:39] in the body
[51:43] he has specialist let me tell you
[51:45] something when one of my children has
[51:47] been helped and somebody says hey we
[51:50] need to put this device on it'll help
[51:52] with their bite or we need to put these
[51:54] for these things on or they need to take
[51:55] this medicine or they need to avoid
[51:57] eating at this time in my I'm thankful
[52:00] for that wisdom that they have that's
[52:07] how God has made us God has placed it
[52:11] you say why would it have to be somebody
[52:14] else to come in and it's got to be
[52:16] called to minister to that need that's
[52:18] how God orchestrated it so we don't come
[52:21] to rest on a man our rest is in the Lord
[52:25] Jesus Christ
[52:28] this is his ministry it's the work of
[52:32] the ministry and I tell you God's love
[52:37] is so great that He desires to see that
[52:41] the message has gotten to his children
[52:42] he'll use every divine avenue that he's
[52:45] placed in the church
[52:49] now I told you these things I found this
[52:51] this burden upon my heart because I see
[52:54] a great need in the church for these
[52:57] things right now it's one of those
[53:00] things that I think that you know and
[53:02] God has to give the inspiration and the
[53:04] unction for the moment but it's that we
[53:06] would have an understanding and of what
[53:09] God has placed at our disposal it's like
[53:14] if you went into your kitchen and your
[53:16] husband got you a bunch of certain pots
[53:18] and certain things and you looked at and
[53:20] said man them things are kind of nice
[53:22] what do they do or you never even asked
[53:25] you just assumed you know maybe here you
[53:27] are working with one pot and you're
[53:29] using this pot for something and you
[53:30] don't need to be using that pot for that
[53:32] this pots designed for it so it needs it
[53:36] that helps to understand you know like
[53:39] certain things like hey don't use that
[53:40] skillet to cook pegs use this skillet
[53:42] over here oh it cooks eggs better they
[53:45] don't stick in it oh thank you for that
[53:47] you see God has placed the gifts in the
[53:50] body for the edifying of the body Oh
[53:55] glory this is why that every when God
[54:00] wrote his word brother Brandon would
[54:03] play it place that he said God gave His
[54:05] Word and that should be sufficient if it
[54:09] was my word he said are your word people
[54:11] wouldn't take it could be it but not God
[54:15] God's not willing that any would perish
[54:18] so God has placed in the church five
[54:20] ministerial gifts and if it still is not
[54:23] got through those five ministerial gifts
[54:26] God has placed nine spiritual gifts
[54:29] listen to me now that every single
[54:32] member of the body of Jesus Christ is
[54:35] subject to one of those nine spiritual
[54:37] gifts at any moment that's why you want
[54:42] to be a bit over the center I don't know
[54:43] if I could do that no be available it's
[54:45] not what you could do
[54:46] it's him coming down and using you
[54:49] hallelujah so to draw all of this is not
[54:53] was not to scatter the church but it's
[54:55] true
[54:56] draw the church together it's to make
[55:00] ready for the coming of the Lord now
[55:02] when brother branham you know would
[55:04] place it like this
[55:05] how that God he would say it like this
[55:07] in the message Jesus Christ the same and
[55:10] he speaks of how he says now in the
[55:12] second paragraph that I have there if
[55:14] you couldn't take my word for it that'd
[55:16] be enough but not God
[55:18] no he moves every stone that can be
[55:21] moved to see if he can get you to
[55:24] believe then he sends his spirit into us
[55:27] sometimes it works in different ways he
[55:29] sends it into us to reveal himself it's
[55:36] very important it works in different
[55:37] ways even among the five ministerial
[55:42] gifts every evangelist is not the same
[55:44] every pastor is not the same every
[55:47] teacher is not the same every apostle is
[55:51] not to say now you might have certain
[55:54] preferences but remember your
[55:56] preferences is all pertaining to you God
[56:01] takes five ministerial gifts and he
[56:05] lifts the devil he exposes him remember
[56:10] these gifts aren't outside the body
[56:11] they're in the body in the message
[56:15] looking at the unseen he said if I
[56:17] didn't mean if I didn't believe your
[56:19] word you'd say let him go I might say
[56:21] the same thing about you but not God not
[56:24] God he he's long-suffering he sends
[56:27] gifts and so forth
[56:30] his love and his long-suffering
[56:33] so when God has set a gift before us
[56:36] this is God being long-suffering it's
[56:40] God's love to us how many times we
[56:44] you've been in a service and you think
[56:46] oh my goodness it's like he's been
[56:50] sitting in our home church it's like
[56:52] this being said here it is this look
[56:54] goodness
[56:55] every time you have any contact with
[56:56] this brother no and it's like where did
[56:59] my goodness how all this is lining up
[57:01] who's doing it it's gone
[57:04] denominations had a good idea but they
[57:07] failed to recognize it's God who
[57:10] oversees his body that's why we don't
[57:13] have an earthly headquarters that we
[57:16] contact to say hey are we on the right
[57:18] page hey are we doing just right hey am
[57:20] i listening to the right tape hey am i
[57:22] listen oh we don't have an earthly
[57:23] headquarters we have a heavenly
[57:25] headquarters that we have been brought
[57:28] in contact with by the Holy Ghost it is
[57:30] called the New Jerusalem it is the
[57:33] mother of the three children of God amen
[57:38] were under his leadership his unction I
[57:41] don't have to call you up and say listen
[57:43] to this message
[57:44] hey brother in unison this message hey
[57:46] you listen brother Adam you listen this
[57:47] message hey you look I don't have to do
[57:49] that I'm so glad that it's not based on
[57:52] me I'm glad that there's one in our myth
[57:55] that he confirms himself by confirming
[57:58] his word that it's him leading us that
[58:06] ought to just lift every big iron little
[58:08] you hallelujah
[58:13] he's long-suffering this is why brother
[58:17] Randall would write it like this as well
[58:19] I'm just laying upon these things these
[58:22] five ministerial offices now when
[58:24] brother Branham was standing here
[58:27] these are things that in the church at
[58:29] that time they were claiming all the
[58:32] rest of the four ministerial gifts but
[58:36] they weren't claiming profits what's
[58:40] what he writes here this or speaks then
[58:43] there's five ministry officers how many
[58:45] believes that sure that's first apostles
[58:48] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[58:50] how many knows that now how can you say
[58:53] there's a pastor or evangelist without
[58:55] saying there's a prophet how can you say
[58:58] there's a prophet when there isn't an
[58:59] apostle some people like to say oh
[59:02] there's pastors evangelists and teachers
[59:04] but they don't want to say prophet
[59:06] that's changed come on now people around
[59:12] the message wanna sale there's a prophet
[59:14] but they don't want to say there's
[59:16] pastors teachers apostles evangelists
[59:21] whoa look how that's changed the same
[59:27] God said teachers and evangelists said
[59:30] prophets he keeps his word
[59:32] we don't pin knife it we just preach it
[59:35] it's up to God to take care of his own
[59:38] work you see God has set this in the
[59:40] church God has sent us I don't have time
[59:42] to labor on this tonight
[59:44] but this is what I'm preaching to you
[59:45] God has sent to us the message in this
[59:49] hour and we have no other message to
[59:52] preach let me just say it clearly as
[59:57] brother Perry green and it's so blessed
[59:59] brother Branham in what house will you
[1:00:01] build me brother brother brother Perry
[1:00:03] says I am only here to back up what God
[1:00:06] has already given to this generation the
[1:00:10] same angel of the Lord that met the
[1:00:13] prophet and delivered that message and
[1:00:15] stood there night after night after
[1:00:18] night he's still right here with his
[1:00:21] children he's never left us we've been
[1:00:25] made aware
[1:00:27] laughter said God open his eyes that he
[1:00:30] might see we've been stabilized with the
[1:00:33] reality the mighty Conqueror is in our
[1:00:37] midst
[1:00:38] [Applause]
[1:00:43] Jesus and Luke 22 and many he had to he
[1:00:48] had to deal with this a number of times
[1:00:49] not just in the different Gospels but
[1:00:51] even in the Gospel of Luke this came up
[1:00:53] a couple times where there got to be
[1:00:56] this
[1:00:56] you know strife among them the Bible
[1:00:59] says among the disciples which of them
[1:01:01] should be accounted the greatest he said
[1:01:05] unto them the kings of the Gentiles
[1:01:07] exercise lordship over them and they
[1:01:11] that exercise authority upon them are
[1:01:12] called benefactors but ye shall not be
[1:01:16] so that's confidence in it this ain't
[1:01:21] gonna be the way it's going to be with
[1:01:23] you all how can that be because his life
[1:01:28] was going to come into them
[1:01:30] he was the example son of God he was the
[1:01:36] example ministry he was the example
[1:01:39] because the bride is to be a reflection
[1:01:42] of the groom is that right so then to
[1:01:47] see that this is not going to be so
[1:01:49] because he though not in physical
[1:01:52] corporal form but he would come back
[1:01:55] into his church to lead his church Oh
[1:01:58] glory be to God but he that is greatest
[1:02:02] among you let him be as the younger
[1:02:06] and he that is chief as he that doth
[1:02:09] serve for whether is greater he that
[1:02:14] sitteth at meat or he that serveth is
[1:02:18] not he that sitteth at meat but I am
[1:02:20] among you as he that serveth see a real
[1:02:24] true gift is not about you serve me a
[1:02:28] real true gift with a real true
[1:02:31] objective and motive has nothing to do
[1:02:34] with a man images bring it down so it is
[1:02:38] even more clear it has nothing to do
[1:02:40] with the fact of a man saying well you
[1:02:43] know I could go work but it's easier I
[1:02:45] would rather do this that man did don't
[1:02:48] don't even think about it because then
[1:02:50] it's not at all what you think it is
[1:02:54] totally the wrong motive and wrong
[1:02:56] objective are you with me I know it's
[1:03:01] getting down kind of a little tight but
[1:03:03] the reality of it is it's not even let
[1:03:06] me bring it down to this it's not even
[1:03:08] about what that man wants to preach
[1:03:11] there's many things and I say I
[1:03:14] mentioned these things to you so that
[1:03:16] you understand that there's been times
[1:03:18] were here things are studied out and you
[1:03:20] know you might think well it's all easy
[1:03:22] but here I am I'm right there at the
[1:03:24] desk and all of a sudden I sense a
[1:03:26] change car like no Lord no Lord no no no
[1:03:28] no I know what that's gonna Intel and
[1:03:30] I'm talking about only maybe a 45-minute
[1:03:34] window
[1:03:36] sometimes you only all you have is just
[1:03:38] a few words on a piece of paper god
[1:03:41] knows what he's doing god knows what
[1:03:45] he's doing
[1:03:46] you know him in my earlier time brother
[1:03:49] Brian made out could've thought oh my
[1:03:50] lord lord did I not give myself more to
[1:03:52] you maybe I should have been praying
[1:03:53] more maybe I should have been doing this
[1:03:54] more maybe I should have been doing this
[1:03:56] more maybe I said no God is just letting
[1:03:57] God lets me know I've got this you might
[1:04:04] be on a your nerves might be on a ball
[1:04:07] of pins and needles but get up there and
[1:04:09] act like it don't act like it act like
[1:04:11] you know what you're doing you know
[1:04:16] realize sometimes preachers are good
[1:04:18] actors but when he comes and takes over
[1:04:21] and he just starts unfolding that then I
[1:04:25] mean we're swimming in good water then
[1:04:28] brother but you see it's not all
[1:04:31] together the things that even that a
[1:04:34] minister wants to preach it's not about
[1:04:36] seeing this and seeing that there's a
[1:04:38] lot of things of of outlines that I
[1:04:40] haven't separate things
[1:04:41] I haven't even come close not even to
[1:04:43] preach it and even upon these things of
[1:04:46] waiting for a time when when is the
[1:04:49] right time not begging God but seeing
[1:04:51] the need but even in seeing the need
[1:04:53] it's just like it is with your own
[1:04:55] family
[1:04:56] you wait till appropriate times yeah you
[1:05:03] don't know so I'm saying you don't tell
[1:05:04] your wife maybe you ought to look to do
[1:05:06] the chicken like this when you're eating
[1:05:08] the chicken right there wait till a day
[1:05:10] later maybe kind of make a suggestion a
[1:05:12] week later come on brothers I can get a
[1:05:14] witness on that there's some experienced
[1:05:16] ones here so now look how brother
[1:05:20] Brandon would put it like this and I
[1:05:22] have heard but now I see he talks about
[1:05:24] Jove and he said Joel had a channel of
[1:05:26] communication to God that he got by
[1:05:29] inspiration he had a way of moving
[1:05:32] himself out and letting God move in he
[1:05:36] knowed he was justified it was a gift it
[1:05:39] was a gift for the people not for Joel
[1:05:42] but for the people think about it Joe
[1:05:46] didn't know what was going on
[1:05:49] blood bombs even tells us over and over
[1:05:52] he said many times he said you might
[1:05:54] take blood I mean you're a prophet you
[1:05:55] know what's going on here you know it's
[1:05:56] a he said no he said he keeps things
[1:05:58] from me as well things he said that I
[1:06:01] don't even know about he does and brings
[1:06:03] the past and I find out after it's
[1:06:05] already happened so it's not God is he's
[1:06:09] obligated in a way God is training even
[1:06:12] as he trained Joe he trains every
[1:06:14] Minister office he trains you and me he
[1:06:17] trains us to wait on him it's when we
[1:06:22] can get ourselves out of the way then he
[1:06:25] steps in that's why brother Branson when
[1:06:28] you talk to that level and take the
[1:06:30] token with you well become a channel
[1:06:35] that's look what he says here it was a
[1:06:37] gift it was a gift for the people not
[1:06:39] for job but for the people know and
[1:06:41] brother ban him here he is Minh in a car
[1:06:44] accident here he's laying in a room on
[1:06:47] the way back to Jeffersonville he said
[1:06:50] put my hand on your mom Billy sister me
[1:06:54] he prayed for it but the gift as he told
[1:06:58] us over and over it's not for me hmm
[1:07:05] that means a lot to me there's a lot of
[1:07:09] things when I'm listening to the message
[1:07:10] it means a lot more than just doctrine
[1:07:12] I'm seeing a life that's been left I'm
[1:07:16] seeing a life that has come to maturity
[1:07:18] and been molded and been changed by the
[1:07:21] Living God Alleluia that's what all
[1:07:26] divine gifts are to serve God's people
[1:07:29] with it's like a song leader a song
[1:07:32] leader might have songs picked out to
[1:07:33] get up here and sing
[1:07:35] God may not want him to sing those songs
[1:07:37] they might even been the songs that he
[1:07:41] likes to sing God may not want him to
[1:07:43] sing those songs somebody might have
[1:07:47] requested hey were you singing this song
[1:07:49] he gets up here he's under the anointing
[1:07:51] and the Spirit of God takes him down
[1:07:53] this pathway right here you see he's
[1:07:54] following the Lord not a list and you
[1:07:59] would see all of the supplies we're
[1:08:01] following him this is why we're all
[1:08:07] divine you it's not about it's just
[1:08:08] serve God's people or mine let me get
[1:08:10] going everybody's not ordered to be a
[1:08:12] prophet not ordered to be praying for
[1:08:14] the sick all of them is not ordered to
[1:08:16] be pastors and so forth but it's a
[1:08:18] channel that God has opened to them a
[1:08:22] channel now I want you to look here let
[1:08:26] me just let them to me let me let me
[1:08:27] skip over and go to John 17 here is the
[1:08:30] Lord Jesus in his prayer and he says
[1:08:33] neither pray I for these alone but for
[1:08:36] them also which shall believe on me
[1:08:39] through their word through that word you
[1:08:44] said well it's gotta be his word but
[1:08:46] remember once he has committed that word
[1:08:49] and given that word it belongs to me we
[1:08:53] become one with it
[1:08:54] then it is no longer I that speaketh
[1:08:57] it's Christ in me Laure Peter God
[1:09:02] that they all may be one notice the
[1:09:06] purpose of this word going forth that
[1:09:08] they all may be one as thou father art
[1:09:11] in me and I envy that they also may be
[1:09:14] one in us that the world may believe
[1:09:18] that thou has sent me see the union with
[1:09:22] him
[1:09:23] Calvary made way for a union where you
[1:09:26] and I could be united with a Living God
[1:09:30] so then it's not us carrying the message
[1:09:33] its Christ in us carrying his message
[1:09:37] its Christ in you the hope of glory its
[1:09:42] Christ in your preaching his gospel it's
[1:09:46] not your words oh if I just you know
[1:09:48] sometimes and all of us have been there
[1:09:50] well if I could just you know the right
[1:09:52] words I had this brothers man at work
[1:09:53] hard this lady at work her or this one
[1:09:55] at work remember jesus said take no
[1:09:59] thought
[1:10:01] you're not that whole phrase deal don't
[1:10:03] become anxious about it take no thought
[1:10:08] what should I do
[1:10:10] you'll be available be available and God
[1:10:14] shut down and use you how many times God
[1:10:18] step down and use the Prophet and he
[1:10:19] didn't even use one scripture a man was
[1:10:24] converted by a by preaching about an
[1:10:26] apple tree help me now brother Han you
[1:10:30] ought to be shouting on this one he
[1:10:31] there was a man converted and a deer
[1:10:34] walked out there he saw God in nature
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:44] you'll be chewing on that one a while
[1:10:48] you see what it is it is not about what
[1:10:51] this scripture of that scripture your
[1:10:53] the Word made flesh I said you're the
[1:10:57] Word made flesh
[1:11:00] no Ramin a God in the highest
[1:11:03] may God help us through their word
[1:11:12] through your word that they would
[1:11:14] believe you see it's not our words that
[1:11:16] brings the conviction
[1:11:18] it's his presence coming behind that
[1:11:21] word it's not our word alone that moves
[1:11:24] the mountain it's his presence behind
[1:11:26] that word that pulse is that mountain to
[1:11:29] be removed my brother branham made this
[1:11:34] day I'm just gonna refer to this quote
[1:11:36] bin so don't get to it this brother I
[1:11:39] made a statement may not be seemingly
[1:11:43] the most popular but it's still truth he
[1:11:45] said the most important thing of the day
[1:11:47] is a good god sent preacher
[1:11:50] I admire their gift and their gift is
[1:11:54] before anything that else could be done
[1:11:56] as a preeminent preacher is a man who
[1:11:58] knows how to rightfully divide the Word
[1:12:00] of God to bring to her what to bring the
[1:12:02] faith of the people that's what the
[1:12:06] Ministry of the word is all about that
[1:12:08] our faith would raise so with that in
[1:12:12] mind let me just say this to you God's a
[1:12:16] preacher
[1:12:20] yo with me I said God's a preacher
[1:12:23] because it has to be him preach but this
[1:12:25] ain't the first time God's preached and
[1:12:28] you know what brother Brian he ain't
[1:12:29] changed his message Galatians 3 8 and
[1:12:33] the scripture foreseeing that God would
[1:12:35] justify the heathen through faith
[1:12:38] preached who preached God preached
[1:12:43] before the gospel unto Abraham saying in
[1:12:48] thee shall all nations be blessed God's
[1:12:52] a preacher he may not be one of the five
[1:12:56] ministerial gifts in your life but he
[1:12:58] still preaches he preaches salmon's
[1:13:04] sometimes among your family he preaches
[1:13:07] series little waves that go you there
[1:13:15] for teaching all nations and baptizing
[1:13:18] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:20] Christ the Ministry of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:23] Christ is to announce the acceptable
[1:13:27] year of the Lord as the jubilee you know
[1:13:32] that speaks up come back to your
[1:13:34] inheritance come back to what rightfully
[1:13:38] belongs to you we're Satan is trying to
[1:13:42] rob you of your inheritance but remember
[1:13:45] there is not one part of that
[1:13:48] inheritance that belongs to this tribe
[1:13:50] can pass to another tribe when AI did
[1:13:54] what he did through as Jezebel's cunning
[1:13:57] way to Naples vineyard but yet no matter
[1:14:00] all of that cunning ways to try to take
[1:14:02] away that inheritance you can't remove
[1:14:05] that inheritance to whom it belongs true
[1:14:08] that lays in the third nation of
[1:14:11] Almighty God and no matter what the
[1:14:14] enemy could have tried to rob you and
[1:14:16] keep you back from your rightful
[1:14:18] inheritance of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:21] but God has seen fit that belongs to you
[1:14:33] no repeated God in the highest this is
[1:14:37] what Paul would say in 2nd Corinthians 3
[1:14:40] for such trust we have through God
[1:14:42] through Christ to God word not that we
[1:14:44] are sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:14:46] anything of ourselves but our
[1:14:48] sufficiency is of God who also hath made
[1:14:52] us able ministers of the New Testament
[1:14:58] Abel what makes you able the sacred
[1:15:02] sands of God's grace meeting that pillar
[1:15:05] of fire what makes you an able believer
[1:15:08] meeting God face-to-face it makes you
[1:15:12] able it equips you not of the letter but
[1:15:16] of the spirit for the letter kills but
[1:15:17] the spirit giveth life notice Paul and I
[1:15:20] want you to take take notice of this
[1:15:23] this is the working of a true apostolic
[1:15:28] ministry it's a ministry that works
[1:15:33] within the body listen to me carefully
[1:15:37] it recognizes the body of which it is a
[1:15:42] part of and it recognizes that God works
[1:15:46] in every part of his body
[1:15:51] this is not a Ministry of song this is
[1:15:54] the ministry of David
[1:15:59] here's me Saul took daughters and sons
[1:16:03] and everything for himself but David
[1:16:07] equipped them to fight but second
[1:16:16] Corinthians five what's what's watch
[1:16:18] this you'll find the same thing in the
[1:16:20] ministry of Malachi for all things are
[1:16:24] of God who has reconciled us to himself
[1:16:27] by Jesus Christ and have given to us the
[1:16:32] Ministry of reconciliation house but I'm
[1:16:36] not a preacher but you're a witness come
[1:16:40] on now you're a witness to wit that God
[1:16:44] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:16:47] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:16:49] unto them and have committed unto us the
[1:16:51] word of reconciliation a word but the
[1:16:56] same that will bring people in to a true
[1:16:59] relationship with Jesus Christ dude
[1:17:02] right not a word that creates trench
[1:17:04] members but a word that actually will
[1:17:08] bring people to a place of
[1:17:09] reconciliation to whether that in
[1:17:12] harmony was God hey man where is the
[1:17:16] ministry of the true atonement coming
[1:17:20] through the church to where Christ is
[1:17:22] reconciled with his people where people
[1:17:26] are not united with a gift they're not
[1:17:28] united with a personality they're not
[1:17:31] united with a man they are united is the
[1:17:34] victory of Jesus Christ hallelujah God
[1:17:43] is not resting his church upon the
[1:17:46] shoulders of man he said upon this rock
[1:17:48] I'll build my church then we are
[1:17:53] ambassadors for Christ it's kind of like
[1:17:58] the same when you went to Texas you were
[1:18:00] an ambassador
[1:18:05] and you brought back some Goods and
[1:18:11] goods kept you going back there as an
[1:18:12] ambassador god bless you sister the same
[1:18:18] thing for you to smile like a possum
[1:18:20] it's the same thing your ambassadors
[1:18:24] knew you were ambassador you are
[1:18:27] represent them adjust down let me bring
[1:18:29] it on down now you are an ambassador you
[1:18:32] are a representative of what this church
[1:18:35] stands for if this church don't believe
[1:18:39] in wearing pants you shouldn't be
[1:18:40] wearing pants this church believes in a
[1:18:44] real genuine baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:46] you want to be a partaker of it come on
[1:18:50] now you're an ambassador your life is an
[1:18:54] ambassador of billboard preach medicine
[1:18:58] I will we are ambassadors of Christ as
[1:19:05] though God did beseech you by us we pray
[1:19:11] you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled
[1:19:13] to God for he hath made him to be sin
[1:19:16] for us who knew no sin that we might be
[1:19:18] made the righteousness of God in him
[1:19:21] 2nd Corinthians 6:1 we've in as workers
[1:19:28] together with him better day workers
[1:19:34] together with him
[1:19:38] God does not work outside of his word he
[1:19:44] doesn't work outside of his body he
[1:19:47] works through his body when the eunuch
[1:19:51] was reading Isaiah 53 listen
[1:19:54] Isaiah was the prophet he had it open in
[1:19:59] the scroll of Isaiah 53 and God took
[1:20:04] Philip from Samaria and caught him away
[1:20:09] for one person did you hear me
[1:20:12] one person God will cause a man to be
[1:20:16] the dead into a meeting that might have
[1:20:19] hundreds for one person that ought to
[1:20:23] make you rejoice because you know what
[1:20:25] God don't have favorites what he's done
[1:20:30] for others he'll do for you
[1:20:34] hallelujah hey man who goes after you
[1:20:37] leave the man a man go after the one he
[1:20:40] went after the one who was there at
[1:20:42] Samaria I'm glad he'll come and minister
[1:20:44] to my knee workers together with him
[1:20:54] here came Philip down to the eunuch you
[1:20:59] understand what you read how can i
[1:21:01] except some man teach me but not the man
[1:21:08] but recognize God works through man let
[1:21:11] me just move on from that God works
[1:21:13] through the office of man so we find we
[1:21:19] know what took place there with that of
[1:21:20] the eunuch now notice beseech you also
[1:21:23] that you receive not the grace of God in
[1:21:25] vain so we want to be workers don't we
[1:21:28] that's why when God has done something
[1:21:31] for your life listen when God has really
[1:21:33] touched a life it ought to be the call
[1:21:35] out of our hearts like Paul what would
[1:21:38] you have me do Lord what can I do for
[1:21:41] your body what can I do Lord God to help
[1:21:44] the work on Lourdes what can I do don't
[1:21:47] receive the grace of God in vain for he
[1:21:49] saith I have heard thee in a time
[1:21:51] accepted into the day of salvation have
[1:21:53] ice occurred thee behold now is the
[1:21:56] acceptable time that hold now is the day
[1:21:59] of salvation
[1:22:02] now to think how's that God replace
[1:22:07] these in here of ministering spirits and
[1:22:11] I'm just going to move on here and skip
[1:22:14] over a few things and go keep on going
[1:22:17] here we have Paul he's setting forth the
[1:22:23] work of the Ministry of the Son of Man
[1:22:25] in the diversity of the offices you
[1:22:29] don't find Peter speaking these things
[1:22:34] about pastors prophets teachers
[1:22:37] evangelists you don't find Peter but yet
[1:22:41] Peter picks up on this and Peter will
[1:22:44] then use the term elders bishop are you
[1:22:49] with me
[1:22:50] these are things that notice within mark
[1:22:53] 16 these words were not there but yet
[1:22:56] the Lord Jesus being the fullness the
[1:22:59] great diamond he had within him every
[1:23:02] one of these gifts are you with me he
[1:23:07] was prophet its teacher pastor
[1:23:11] evangelist apostle right they wanted him
[1:23:15] to stay in this town and he said no no I
[1:23:16] must need to go to the other town that
[1:23:18] preached to is that right now watch out
[1:23:21] that Paul is going through this once
[1:23:23] again he's inclusive therefore seeing we
[1:23:27] have this ministry singular as we have
[1:23:32] received mercy
[1:23:33] we think not but have renounced the
[1:23:37] hidden things of dishonesty not walking
[1:23:39] in craftiness nor handling the Word of
[1:23:42] God deceitfully but by manifestation of
[1:23:45] the truth commending ourselves to every
[1:23:47] man's conscience in the sight of God if
[1:23:50] our gospel be hid it is hid to them that
[1:23:53] are lost in whom the god of this world
[1:23:57] has blinded the minds of them which
[1:24:00] believe not lest the light of the
[1:24:04] glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:24:08] of God should shine unto them for
[1:24:14] we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:24:22] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[1:24:29] Jesus sake your servants not your Lords
[1:24:38] not sure
[1:24:40] dictators your servants servants is to
[1:24:46] serve his body
[1:24:48] it's him ministering to the needs of his
[1:24:54] wife his care is so precise his care is
[1:25:02] so delicate his care is so intentional
[1:25:05] his care is so perfect and in all of it
[1:25:11] its edifying
[1:25:16] we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:25:20] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[1:25:23] Jesus sake for God who commanded the
[1:25:26] light to shine out of Darkness hath
[1:25:29] shined in our hearts notice the same
[1:25:32] what happened in Genesis 1 the same God
[1:25:35] where there was darkness he spoke and
[1:25:40] light let there be light so the spoken
[1:25:45] word and light that light is the life of
[1:25:50] men
[1:25:51] well what is fear look what he's saying
[1:25:53] for God who commanded the light to shine
[1:25:56] out of Darkness hath shined in our
[1:25:59] hearts to give the light of the
[1:26:02] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:26:05] face of Jesus Christ in the face in the
[1:26:07] presence of Jesus Christ
[1:26:10] you know Paul is saying here we have no
[1:26:12] light of our own we have no light of our
[1:26:16] own the light is that which is reflected
[1:26:19] it's a reflected light a light that he
[1:26:24] himself has shined into us but notice
[1:26:27] it's his right not our life his life and
[1:26:30] where does it do it shows forth Jesus
[1:26:33] Christ to be the same yesterday today
[1:26:37] and forever
[1:26:41] that's why brother Graham said the
[1:26:43] message of the hour in one house will
[1:26:46] you build me it's not just to be the
[1:26:49] flame of the other it's to be the flame
[1:26:51] of our hearts because he said and we
[1:26:54] know this would be the truth if it's not
[1:26:56] the flame of our hearts we can't rightly
[1:26:58] present it to others
[1:27:02] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:27:05] vessels that the excellency of the power
[1:27:08] may be of God
[1:27:16] earthen vessels
[1:27:20] probably everybody in here knows what a
[1:27:23] clay flowerpot is there's an earthen
[1:27:28] clay a vessel now it's not like some of
[1:27:33] these make-believe pots that I've seen
[1:27:34] it lowers they look they look that way
[1:27:40] my lord I thought one one come on for
[1:27:42] shelter oh here goes a million pieces
[1:27:44] it just looked that way it wasn't
[1:27:48] breakable
[1:27:49] it was just fiberglass but you take one
[1:27:53] of those clay pots you might only have
[1:27:55] drop it this far get a break you know
[1:27:59] why it's made out of fragile frail weak
[1:28:03] material and God has chosen frail weak
[1:28:08] material that he might step inside and
[1:28:17] display his strength I'm talking about
[1:28:21] you tonight I'm talking about every one
[1:28:24] of us tonight not just the ministerial
[1:28:26] gift I'm talking about every one of us
[1:28:28] it's greater is He that is in us
[1:28:32] hallelujah many times we could have went
[1:28:35] to pieces but there's one on the inside
[1:28:37] brother
[1:28:38] we're not held together by Elmer's glue
[1:28:41] were held together by the supernatural
[1:28:44] power of God amen that's guiding us
[1:28:48] through the excellencies of the power of
[1:28:51] God and not of us brother Branham would
[1:28:57] stand in the message birth pains he said
[1:28:58] don't you look at the messenger you look
[1:29:01] at his message
[1:29:04] focus on that message you see this
[1:29:08] diamond that we we looked at let me just
[1:29:11] close
[1:29:16] this diamond we talked about last
[1:29:18] weekend we'll pick this up here maybe
[1:29:23] next week you know a diamond let me
[1:29:27] leave you with this you know a diamond
[1:29:28] that's it's important some of the
[1:29:34] brothers writing everything inside sighs
[1:29:36] sighs sighs no in reality the most
[1:29:44] important thing about a diamond is the
[1:29:47] cut
[1:29:53] because those who are cutting it that's
[1:29:58] what they do for a living I even know
[1:30:00] they use lasers now but the cuts what's
[1:30:03] most important the weight is also
[1:30:07] important so they have a trying to get
[1:30:11] this balanced out with weight and cut
[1:30:14] because if they get the cut a little off
[1:30:19] to where it doesn't really show the fire
[1:30:22] on the inside of that diamond they can
[1:30:26] still charge if they make it bigger they
[1:30:29] can still charge a pretty good price for
[1:30:32] it
[1:30:33] but in order to get that fire to show
[1:30:36] that's in it it takes the right kind of
[1:30:39] cut because when they put that cut in
[1:30:42] there one who makes it must understand
[1:30:47] the lights and the angles many times you
[1:30:52] know they ask you some sister gets the
[1:30:56] keys let me see the ring
[1:31:07] better saying you get a ring yeah all
[1:31:10] right man all right yeah
[1:31:17] but how it's cut determines its
[1:31:20] brilliance there's a couple qualities
[1:31:22] and I'm just going close brilliance and
[1:31:24] dispersion brilliance is how much light
[1:31:28] it returns the run the cut itself will
[1:31:33] determine how much light it returns the
[1:31:38] dispersion will actually be how much
[1:31:43] internal fire it displays so it's got to
[1:31:48] be cut just right he was wounded for our
[1:31:54] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:31:59] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:32:02] was upon him
[1:32:04] Norah Peter God the cut was made by the
[1:32:11] master cutter he knew exactly where to
[1:32:16] cut it so that the brilliance of that
[1:32:19] light might return so that the
[1:32:23] dispersion of the eternal internal fire
[1:32:26] might come forth and just to think a
[1:32:30] little bride he gave you the wedding
[1:32:34] band and it's got that diamond right
[1:32:37] there on it
[1:32:41] in that awesome
[1:32:45] he's given his gifts to the church and
[1:32:50] every one of those gifts pastor prophet
[1:32:53] teacher evangelist apostle all the nine
[1:32:55] spiritual give you that which lays in
[1:32:59] your life is for the body of Jesus
[1:33:03] Christ
[1:33:07] how glorious is the body of Jesus Christ
[1:33:12] because of him oh you know you almost
[1:33:18] stand there to see the Queen of Sheba
[1:33:19] remember when she came to Solomon and
[1:33:21] she stood and she came and watched her
[1:33:24] she had proved him with hard sayings the
[1:33:26] Bible says she stood in his house
[1:33:28] and she watched his servants put meat
[1:33:35] she watched him how they went up the
[1:33:37] stairs and she said there was no spirit
[1:33:44] well she said happy what gift is it that
[1:33:52] God has placed in our midst that's what
[1:33:57] the Ministry of Malachi 4 came to bring
[1:34:00] the church where the church had got off
[1:34:02] target come on now they got off target
[1:34:06] he came to bring it back around the real
[1:34:09] true genuine gift that we ought to be
[1:34:12] rallying around and that is the Lord
[1:34:14] Jesus Christ the ghost
[1:34:18] thank God for the eyes in this hour to
[1:34:22] catch that and bring the church you know
[1:34:23] what that is that's an apse that's the
[1:34:25] absolute of the church this is the
[1:34:27] anchor of the church this is the place
[1:34:30] of safety of the Church of the Living
[1:34:32] God this is the place of stabilizing
[1:34:37] that's just Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:34:45] thank you tonight for your mercy Oh God

[1:35:14] to move into this Lord take us through
[1:35:19] this with them the gifts the officers
[1:35:21] are placed in the church I believe
[1:35:24] within every one of these I believe
[1:35:28] there's things that Lord that you're
[1:35:29] speaking as you as you do in each
[1:35:33] service you have a personal conference
[1:35:35] with every life
[1:35:39] Lord Jesus I pray
[1:35:43] that here tonight as your word has gone
[1:35:46] forth
[1:35:47] I asked Lord Jesus that you would Lord
[1:35:54] you come to encourage that harder that
[1:35:57] life
[1:35:58] that they may rise take their
[1:36:01] inheritance

[1:36:05] little bit tonight Lord if it hasn't
[1:36:08] raised quite to that place I pray that
[1:36:10] God it's it's moved even if it's moved
[1:36:13] just an answer
[1:36:14] I pray that it's moved an inch Lord
[1:36:16] that's closer to you than it was when it
[1:36:18] first came in here I pray that God for
[1:36:21] any heart it might be looking in their
[1:36:25] life there's a question that they would
[1:36:28] have what would you have me do I pray
[1:36:30] Lord that you'll let them and let them
[1:36:34] see what your desire is of how that you

[1:36:41] parts every one of these things norden's
[1:36:45] for your glory
[1:36:47] it's amazing Lord I I said in my office
[1:36:51] many times and I listen and listen to
[1:36:53] the songs that are sung listen to the
[1:36:55] specials listen many times Lord to the
[1:36:58] prayers it's being prayed over the
[1:36:59] prayer requests and hearing the Lord how
[1:37:03] that you're just bringing a service

[1:37:09] they don't they don't know what I'm

[1:37:14] angled the direction I don't know the
[1:37:16] songs they're gonna see God how that you

[1:37:22] just help us Lord to see your love may
[1:37:25] we see it it's your long-suffering nor
[1:37:28] their every gift you've placed in the
[1:37:29] body it's your love being reflected back
[1:37:33] into the church

[1:37:38] I pray you and help each and every each
[1:37:41] and every one of your children tonight
[1:37:43] may there be more may every one of us
[1:37:47] being more consecrated to be available
[1:37:52] to be available to you lord
[1:37:57] I think of the woman Lord with a little
[1:38:01] alabaster box she knew you were gonna be
[1:38:04] there she was moved to do you a service
[1:38:09] Lord God may we be moved Lord to do you
[1:38:14] a service but you said as you've done it
[1:38:17] unto the least of these you've done it
[1:38:18] unto me
[1:38:19] Oh God how we are so thankful for the
[1:38:24] Holy Ghost we're so thankful for the
[1:38:28] word God you've sin Anissa Weier
[1:38:31] thankful for the body of Jesus Christ
[1:38:33] Lord I'm thankful for each and every
[1:38:35] gift I'm thankful for each and every
[1:38:39] every gift you placed in the body oh god

[1:38:55] thank you lord I thank you for every
[1:38:58] life that you're working on right now I

[1:39:11] in every talent Lord in the body thank
[1:39:15] you Lord God for every burden Lord God
[1:39:18] that you placed upon our hearts Oh God
[1:39:25] I think of sister Bruce Lord I've looked
[1:39:29] at that statement many many times your
[1:39:32] prophet she thought she was gonna
[1:39:34] perhaps pass away she was in that
[1:39:38] interview with you with the Prophet and
[1:39:43] when the Prophet began to pray mother
[1:39:45] Branham would use these words he said
[1:39:48] she's like Dorcas of old father and she
[1:39:51] said value to this church Lord we meet
[1:39:55] her Lord what many people did not know
[1:39:59] is how sister Bruce would get a burden
[1:40:02] on her heart to pray for somebody she
[1:40:06] couldn't stop until she prayed for him
[1:40:09] she'd go to the hospitals and pray for
[1:40:11] him many miracles many things took place
[1:40:17] that yet Lord God is not a lot than knew
[1:40:21] about it but yet Lord she saw her part
[1:40:25] what you asked her to do and she was
[1:40:28] willing she said yes
[1:40:30] Lord God may you find the same in us may
[1:40:35] you find it Lord God among us Lourdes
[1:40:37] ministers may you find it Lord God among
[1:40:42] our lives Lord Jesus
[1:40:44] it's not about crowds not about the size
[1:40:47] of the crowd not about the size of the
[1:40:49] church not about how many people that we
[1:40:51] can have around us Lord this is for
[1:40:54] every one of us it's about serving your
[1:40:58] body and help us Lord to be available
[1:41:04] help us to be available help us Lord
[1:41:07] that we can remember that as you came
[1:41:10] down the god of glory you took on the
[1:41:12] form of a servant to minister to our
[1:41:18] needs
[1:41:20] Gordan I want to say it I believe
[1:41:24] there's others tonight they will join me
[1:41:25] I'm available I'm available papa
[1:41:30] Lord God if you want to use me Lord not
[1:41:34] just his reach the word I think of how
[1:41:37] your prophet would say it like this when
[1:41:39] he challenged himself and brother
[1:41:40] Neville he said that this is what God
[1:41:42] has called me to do but what about
[1:41:43] beyond this can I do for the kingdom of
[1:41:45] God Oh Lord Jesus help us lord help us
[1:41:51] father I pray may we not try to live
[1:41:54] maybe the psalm leaders or not try to
[1:41:56] limit you and just say well I lead songs
[1:41:59] but Lord God may it be Lord from the
[1:42:01] heart Lord what else would you have me
[1:42:02] do Lord Jesus for each and every one of
[1:42:07] us Lord it's a vital part in your body
[1:42:15] we never see the cells taking in the
[1:42:19] nourishment that's been broke down and
[1:42:22] carried in the bloodstream invented but
[1:42:25] we see the effects of it because that
[1:42:29] life has strength the body has strength
[1:42:32] because the food was able to get to the
[1:42:37] right place
[1:42:38] help us Lord we might be the feet we
[1:42:41] might be the hands the ears the eyes the
[1:42:43] nose but what a blessing it is to be a
[1:42:46] part of the body of Jesus Christ maybe
[1:42:49] we do our part Lord I pray
[1:42:51] being yielded being every gift it's to
[1:42:54] get ourselves out of the way
[1:42:55] help us Lord I pray tonight in the name
[1:43:00] of Jesus Christ I'm in like to be
