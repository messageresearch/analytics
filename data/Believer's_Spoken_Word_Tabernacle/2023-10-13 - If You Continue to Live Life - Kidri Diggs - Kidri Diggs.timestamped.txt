[30:29] [Applause]
[30:31] Jesus we're certainly living in a great
[30:33] hour amen you know when we look around
[30:37] us and we see the things that are taking
[30:40] place continually and the pray requests
[30:43] that went up we're always in line when
[30:46] we pray for the Peace of
[30:48] Jerusalem we realize that there'll never
[30:51] be peace on the earth in the system that
[30:54] it is but we know what we're praying
[30:56] about
[30:57] because there is a promise that God
[31:00] himself will bring everything centered
[31:04] right there we know that where we're
[31:07] standing in this hour by God's grace
[31:10] we've received a rapturing
[31:12] message rapturing Grace than you Lord we
[31:16] know the very next thing that is to come
[31:19] amen is the re is the rapture and we
[31:21] step into the wedding supper then from
[31:24] there into the
[31:26] millennium my what changes will take
[31:28] place even in Israel at that time when
[31:31] the bride's off the scene the 144,000
[31:34] gets her
[31:35] call you know when that when the news
[31:38] struck and I didn't comment too much on
[31:39] it on Sunday but when the news struck on
[31:41] Saturday the first thing that struck my
[31:43] heart because you know that Israel is
[31:46] always on top of things if if there's
[31:49] anybody you want to know where that
[31:51] person is ask
[31:55] Israel but I couldn't help but something
[31:57] and I I didn't I didn't read up on it
[31:59] but something just struck my heart and I
[32:00] was with some other ministers on
[32:02] Saturday morning and I I said you know
[32:05] what I can't help but resonate in my
[32:07] heart is they know that evil was all
[32:10] around them
[32:12] somehow I wonder I said if there was
[32:14] just a little bit of
[32:16] laxness that got in there that's because
[32:20] Israel wouldn't have permitted that you
[32:22] wouldn't permit that I I wouldn't permit
[32:24] we wouldn't permit the enemy to come
[32:25] into our home wouldn't permit the enemy
[32:28] but you see even now you're finding out
[32:31] reports Egypt told them right Egypt let
[32:34] him know certain
[32:35] things and I I just say it in this way
[32:38] it it shows that Israel's All Surrounded
[32:41] and one thing about it you know God is
[32:44] with
[32:45] Israel amen God is with God is with his
[32:48] people you know why because there's
[32:51] 144,000 yes sir that are to be sealed
[32:53] that's right that's why Hallelujah you
[32:56] know why the Merc mercy of God is still
[32:58] here because they're still elect to be
[33:00] brought in the blood's still on The
[33:03] Mercy Seat the lamb is still speaking
[33:05] with full Authority and in this hour
[33:08] that we're we're living and I think man
[33:10] is the Bride of Jesus Christ David spoke
[33:13] of it in Psalms 27 we're
[33:15] surrounded we're surrounded yeah but
[33:18] ain't it wonderful that as psalms 27
[33:21] goes on to read that our focus is not
[33:25] about on everything that's around us
[33:28] right that doesn't mean that we're
[33:29] ignoring it that don't mean we're
[33:30] becoming laxed it's quite the opposite
[33:33] when we have a desire to dwell only in
[33:36] the house of the
[33:38] Lord that's the secret to Victory right
[33:40] there that's the secret to preparedness
[33:43] that I don't have to try to scope out
[33:45] every way the enemy is trying to get me
[33:46] all I have to do is keep my eyes on him
[33:48] and keep that desire and keep everything
[33:50] clear and God himself will unfold every
[33:53] tactic of the enemy
[33:55] Hallelujah I got confidence in
[33:58] him don't
[34:00] you amen it's it's a it's I tell you
[34:04] it's a horrible atrocities that the
[34:07] things that um you know no wonder my
[34:10] wife I I didn't realize about it but my
[34:12] wife just said you know they're really I
[34:14] guess in the states here they're telling
[34:15] the people as far as the young people
[34:17] and everybody else stay off the social
[34:19] media and stuff because of things
[34:20] that'll be posted and everything else
[34:22] and you you can't even grasp how that
[34:25] people could be that heartless but I
[34:28] want to tell you what it is it isn't man
[34:31] it's Spirits that's
[34:33] right and those Nations themselves let
[34:36] me just tell you like this those nations
[34:38] are actually benefiting from things that
[34:41] Israel has found out that's good that's
[34:44] from their medical Technologies to on
[34:46] and on and on that's right and they
[34:49] don't even know why they hate them right
[34:51] right but it's a
[34:53] spirit because you see within the midst
[34:55] of it God's made a promise promise that
[34:57] he's going to bring Israel
[34:59] back you and I are that hidden part
[35:02] inside of there the mystery that's of
[35:04] God that's being worked out but God made
[35:07] a promise and I'll tell you what God
[35:09] ain't never had to repent you don't ever
[35:12] have to back up and say I made a mistake
[35:14] I didn't realize it going to be this
[35:15] hard God is right on
[35:18] time he's right on time God is going to
[35:22] gather his people
[35:24] home I tell you I'm thank God there's a
[35:27] place of safety there's a place of
[35:29] hiding we want to pray for them we want
[35:31] to pray for them and I know you have
[35:33] been continued there within Israel and
[35:37] uh that God will just continue to be
[35:39] merciful there I I just I I know it in
[35:42] this way and I I don't say it in
[35:43] overconfidence I just said there's a
[35:45] rest in it God just the littlest place
[35:48] but God's watching over
[35:50] it you know you might feel so small
[35:53] God's Watching Over You amen an't it
[35:56] powerful
[35:57] littlest place and yet it's a place
[35:59] that's most hated it's Spirits it's
[36:04] Spirits it it's it's spirits but aren't
[36:07] you glad that the holy spirit is present
[36:10] yes he has brought peace in your heart
[36:11] peace in your life and that's what he

[37:11] that we have on our hearts he knows the
[37:14] directions that we're praying about God
[37:16] knows those things and he cares and God
[37:19] has such a way that he can say it word
[37:22] by word and then there's times where God
[37:24] will say things that it's like in code
[37:28] nobody else will catch it but you catch
[37:30] it that's good pre and it's so clear as
[37:33] though everything was said and wrote out
[37:35] right here true and the God will say it
[37:38] because it's so personal to you and you
[37:39] get that message and if you tried to say
[37:41] something to somebody else about say
[37:43] well I didn't hear him say that that's
[37:44] right but you see the spirit of the Lord
[37:47] the spirit of Truth he comes and reveals
[37:50] to us what we have need of I'm glad I'm

[42:34] Genesis Chapter
[42:37] 18
[42:39] amen praise
[42:43] God Genesis
[42:46] Chapter
[42:53] 18 and we're just going to read um
[42:56] one verse out of here and then we're
[42:58] going to go to habaka the second
[43:00] chapter Genesis 18 and verse
[43:10] 14 the Bible says is anything too hard
[43:14] for the Lord at the time appointed I
[43:18] will return unto thee according to the
[43:20] time of life and Sarah shall have a son
[43:26] amen let's go to
[43:27] habaka chapter
[43:36] 2 habaka chapter
[43:38] [Music]
[43:42] 2 verse one the Bible says I will stand
[43:45] upon my watch and set me upon the towels
[43:48] and will watch to see what he will say
[43:51] unto me and what I shall answer when I
[43:55] am reproved
[43:56] and the Lord answered me and said write
[44:00] the vision and make it plain upon tables
[44:03] that he may run that readeth it for the
[44:07] vision is yet for an appointed
[44:10] time but at the end it shall speak and
[44:15] not lie though it t wait for it because
[44:19] it will surely come it will not t amen
[44:24] may the Lord at a blessing to the
[44:26] reading of his word you can have your
[44:35] seats by God's grace tonight I want to
[44:38] use for a subject The Mystery of
[44:41] Life The Mystery of Life amen you know
[44:46] when we speak of
[44:48] Life uh you can't talk about life good
[44:51] life without talking about God because
[44:55] outside of him we're not really
[44:58] living we're not really living life and
[45:02] and and and and life God say he he's
[45:05] come to give us life and life more
[45:07] abundantly amen so not just any your
[45:11] regular life but an abundant life and
[45:14] this Abundant Life should speak of
[45:16] Christ amen but what I want tonight by
[45:19] the grace of God is as a people of god
[45:22] let's have an attitude adjustment
[45:24] Hallelujah on cuz when we look at life
[45:27] we can be very stubborn and we we and me
[45:31] I we all would say I want my life to go
[45:35] this way but I'm here to say that your
[45:37] life is hidden and revealed in the
[45:40] mystery of God that's right Hallelujah
[45:43] so what you may look at concerning life
[45:46] is not what God is looking at and what
[45:48] you might want to come out of life is
[45:51] not what God may want to come out of
[45:53] life so our attitudes should just to
[45:56] should adjust to the way God is
[45:59] revealing the mystery of our life
[46:02] Hallelujah and you know church when you
[46:04] when you speak of a mystery I don't want
[46:07] to say of something that's that hasn't
[46:09] been revealed Hallelujah because we're
[46:12] in a day we're in a time where the
[46:14] mystery of Christ who is life has been
[46:17] revealed Hallelujah so what I'm saying
[46:20] tonight is who you are Hallelujah your
[46:23] life should be standing in looking at
[46:26] you in the mirror Hallelujah the things
[46:29] that happen to us the things that take
[46:31] place it shouldn't Hallelujah we
[46:34] shouldn't be shocked Hallelujah but we
[46:36] should look at these things and say hey
[46:38] God is in control Hallelujah and you
[46:40] know God God God has a way of doing
[46:43] things to bring out the best of Life
[46:46] Hallelujah that's right and that's what
[46:48] it's all about Hallelujah God wants to
[46:50] bring out the best in you Hallelujah he
[46:52] wants to bring out the best of your life
[46:54] Hallelujah the best best of your
[46:56] strength the best of your abilities
[46:59] Hallelujah the best of who you are
[47:02] concerning life but it looks like a
[47:05] mystery because to get the best of us
[47:08] you got to receive some
[47:12] strength Ain get too many amens on that
[47:14] one brother sers Hallelujah to get the
[47:18] best out of her she got to go through
[47:19] some pain Hallelujah to get the best out
[47:22] of us you may have to go down a road
[47:24] Hallelujah that's still a mystery
[47:27] Hallelujah and you know church when we
[47:29] look and we read the Bible right here
[47:32] where God told Abraham Hallelujah he
[47:34] told Abraham look look look before I go
[47:37] into this just let me peek it back off
[47:39] what brother Samuel was saying about
[47:40] Israel Hallelujah as we look at Israel
[47:43] and we see all these things taking place
[47:46] it has to be this
[47:49] way
[47:50] Hallelujah Israel has to fight
[47:53] Hallelujah the world has to turn again
[47:56] Israel why because God said so in his
[48:00] word hallelujah so the mystery of Israel
[48:04] Hallelujah Israel's life has been
[48:06] revealed to the bride of Christ Hall so
[48:09] we should see these things and we should
[48:11] Hallelujah say this is a joyous occasion
[48:15] hallelujah hallelujah this for us oh my
[48:19] if I can say it like this for us this is
[48:21] not a time of
[48:23] pain but for Israel it is
[48:26] see Israel is receiving the pain and we
[48:29] are receiving the joy of Life Hallelujah
[48:32] because in their pain we're being
[48:34] revealed Hallelujah in their pain we're
[48:37] getting ready to step out of here
[48:39] hallelujah so when we look at life and
[48:42] everybody else is saying oh it's a war
[48:44] it's a war it's a war all the pain all
[48:46] the agony all the lies we're standing
[48:49] back saying thank you
[48:54] Jesus because the miss history of this
[48:56] time that's been appointed is unfolding
[48:59] right before our eyes so a lot of times
[49:02] when things happen in a stressful and
[49:05] painful mode we have to take an attitude
[49:08] to judgment and ask ourselves is this
[49:12] God
[49:14] hallelujah because when you look at
[49:16] things through a natural lens of Life
[49:19] you'll miss God hallelujah because God
[49:22] is hidden and revealed in Simplicity and
[49:24] he also so Hallelujah he reveals himself
[49:27] Hallelujah not to the wise amen right
[49:31] but to the simple-hearted the
[49:34] simple-minded and you would think of God
[49:36] who's Hallelujah who doesn't have to be
[49:38] taught wisdom who who who needs no more
[49:41] strength who needs no more help anything
[49:43] about him Hallelujah it would seem very
[49:46] mysterious but God came down and he put
[49:49] the mystery of life right in our
[49:52] hands Hallelujah right in our face
[49:56] Hallelujah therefore church when we look
[49:58] at life and the different things that
[50:00] happen to us we ought to look through a
[50:02] different lens to say Lord I appreciate
[50:06] what you're doing Hallelujah because
[50:08] you're getting me ready for something
[50:09] amen you know just brings me Hallelujah
[50:12] hold on for a
[50:19] second it brings me uh to the scripture
[50:23] or to the message the prophet preached
[50:26] called birth pains Hallelujah and when
[50:29] he talked about birth he included pain
[50:32] with it Hallelujah birth pain and for
[50:34] you mothers who have had a child the
[50:37] Bible says when that mother is in
[50:39] travail she remembers pain and stress
[50:42] and all these things until the baby is
[50:44] born when the baby is born Hallelujah
[50:48] that life Hallelujah takes away all the
[50:51] pain the revealing Hallelujah of what
[50:54] was inside the revealing of the mystery
[50:57] Hallelujah brings joy to that mother
[51:00] Hallelujah although she had contractions
[51:03] and although she had Mourning sickness
[51:05] and although her walk had to change her
[51:08] wardrobe had to change she experienced
[51:10] pain at the pain but when that baby is
[51:13] born she remembers the pain no more W
[51:17] Hallelujah so church it's the mystery of
[51:20] what's inside of you being revealed
[51:22] through pain that has us rejoicing
[51:25] [Applause]
[51:29] Hallelujah now we know how this
[51:33] work you pull I
[51:36] preach and right now some of you in
[51:39] relaxed mode on you're just
[51:43] chilling but I want you to understand
[51:45] Hallelujah there's a mystery being
[51:49] revealed it it's being revealed right
[51:52] now about you and your life you say
[51:56] brother my life is all jacked up that's
[51:58] because there's something about you God
[52:00] is trying to
[52:02] unfold God is trying to
[52:04] unveil Hallelujah and God will never get
[52:07] the real you without any stress and
[52:15] pain and there are things in us that we
[52:18] didn't even know was in us hallelujah
[52:21] until we get on that
[52:22] path amen amen
[52:26] hallelujah look God God loves a
[52:30] challenge Hallelujah and you know what
[52:32] the Lord's been doing with me brother
[52:35] Samuel most places I've
[52:37] gone you know the services have been a
[52:40] little different huj more than just a
[52:43] regular service you know I was in if you
[52:47] don't mind me testifying for a second I
[52:50] was in Canada about two weeks ago and we
[52:53] were having some Youth Services and and
[52:56] you know I was in my hotel room and just
[52:58] like any other minister you just trying
[53:00] to catch the mind of God you know you
[53:02] cuz you when you speak you want to speak
[53:04] life Hallelujah preaching to me is not
[53:09] about me showing you my
[53:11] Revelation preaching is about me getting
[53:13] out of the way so God can have a one
[53:15] onone with you that's so God can ask
[53:19] your prayers so God can hear your
[53:21] thoughts and desires so God can confirm
[53:24] the Ministries that you sit up under
[53:26] Hallelujah so God can show you that he's
[53:29] with you Hallelujah that's what Ministry
[53:31] is to me Ministry Hallelujah per se for
[53:34] me is not coming down showing you
[53:36] Hallelujah everything I know in the
[53:41] Bible they can do that in the Baptist
[53:43] Church
[53:46] Hallelujah but when we come together and
[53:50] we sit under the umbrella of the word
[53:52] hallelujah we should walk out of here
[53:54] knowing that we made a
[53:56] connection Hallelujah but I think
[53:59] sometimes Hallelujah can I step on this
[54:02] yes sir
[54:03] Hallelujah I want to make sure I ain't
[54:05] out of order Hallelujah cuz I'm very
[54:08] unconventional Hallelujah Church
[54:10] Hallelujah whether we realize it or not
[54:12] Hallelujah God does things Hallelujah to
[54:16] make us question if he's still
[54:18] God that's good Hallelujah come on now
[54:22] you say brother what do you mean in the
[54:24] proud of your life life paying tithes
[54:26] and serving God filled with the Holy
[54:29] Ghost you'll go through a trial that you
[54:31] have no answer
[54:34] for what is he doing he's bringing out a
[54:37] mystery that was there all
[54:41] along and the only way it's going to
[54:43] come out is if you continue to this is
[54:46] my this is my subject H if you continue
[54:48] to live
[54:51] life Hallelujah because a lot of times
[54:54] people get saved and they stop living
[54:56] because they want to make sure
[54:58] everything is in
[54:59] order they worried about this one
[55:01] watching and that one watching the dos
[55:03] and the don'ts and and the laws and the
[55:05] bylaws and all these things and they
[55:07] can't even enjoy life hallelujah what do
[55:11] you mean the life of redemption
[55:13] Hallelujah God has saved me I'm not on
[55:16] my way to hell I'm on my way to
[55:20] heaven so when we come to church there
[55:23] should be an atmosphere of joy amen yes
[55:27] sir because life is meant to be
[55:31] lived yes sir the scripture says if you
[55:33] try to save your life you'll lose it h
[55:36] if you give your life you'll get it back
[55:38] again H so which one are you
[55:41] doing hu that's good when we come to
[55:46] church we should be making a contact
[55:49] amen but what do you mean a contact H
[55:52] contact it applies two things
[55:56] a giving and a
[55:58] receiving H and most of the time we
[56:02] always want to be on the receiving end
[56:05] Hallelujah but no to make a contact
[56:08] Hallelujah you got to give out something
[56:10] also yes sir Hall and right now I'm on
[56:13] the giving end of the contact Hallelujah
[56:16] and you may be on the receiving end
[56:18] Hallelujah but then again if I'm looking
[56:20] through your eyes you may be on the
[56:22] giving end of it pulling Hallelujah on
[56:25] Amen so where are you in this
[56:27] relationship tonight Hallelujah are you
[56:29] making a contact H cuz we have to give
[56:32] and receive and receive and give to have
[56:35] a contact with Christ up in here if
[56:37] there's a true Spirit of the Lord in you
[56:40] you got to give me something
[56:42] [Applause]
[56:44] tonight
[56:46] Hallelujah because that's how God works
[56:50] God gives he receives God gives he SS
[56:52] and he reaps Hallelujah and when we have
[56:54] have a service when we come to church it
[56:57] should be two things going on that
[56:58] should be a contact being made from
[57:01] sewing and reaping Hallelujah giving and
[57:03] receiving Hallelujah and if you're not
[57:05] giving or receiving you're just
[57:09] here come on now and if you are just
[57:12] here you're not an expression of life
[57:15] because this wood is here these
[57:18] are here this carpet is here these lamps
[57:22] are here hallelujah and every else that
[57:25] has no life is
[57:28] here so that should be something
[57:30] different about us when we come together
[57:34] Under the Umbrella of the word of
[57:38] God but the turn of Life The Mystery of
[57:41] Life he told Abraham Hallelujah you pull
[57:44] I preach
[57:46] Hallelujah yes sir church he told
[57:49] Abraham he said at the appointed time
[57:53] what appointed time the appointed time
[57:54] time of life see God will speak a word
[57:58] and walk off and want you to
[58:03] live that's good PR
[58:07] on he'll speak a word and don't fulfill
[58:11] it that day don't fulfill it that week
[58:13] or that month or maybe that year but he
[58:16] still wants you to keep
[58:18] living because the only way you're going
[58:21] to get up to that promise is for you to
[58:23] keep living and believing what God has
[58:26] said Hallelujah the only way we're going
[58:28] to see God is if we keep walking
[58:31] hallelujah what did he tell Abraham he
[58:33] gave Abraham a promise of a seed of a
[58:36] child at the age of a hundred or
[58:38] whatever he was and then he told Abraham
[58:41] walk before me and be thou
[58:45] perfect
[58:53] good he said said walk before me sir and
[58:56] be thy perfect Hallelujah so if you want
[58:59] anything from God you got to make steps
[59:02] Hallelujah if you want anything from God
[59:05] hallelujah you have to Hallelujah become
[59:07] one with what he said to you amen we
[59:10] can't just sit back and expect God
[59:13] Hallelujah to do it all on his own
[59:15] without you being on one of those ends
[59:17] of the
[59:19] connection Hallelujah you like Brother D
[59:21] what are you talking about amen I'm
[59:23] trying to create an atmosphere in here
[59:24] tonight so right now I'm binding some
[59:26] Spirits Hallelujah Church the prophet of
[59:30] God will say what good is it for the
[59:32] minister the study Hallelujah lay with
[59:34] God and prepare and do all these things
[59:37] and get anointed and for the church not
[59:39] to be
[59:41] anointed so I need you just as much as
[59:43] you need me Hallelujah if we want to see
[59:46] God it has to be a group at
[59:50] fight Hallelujah he said you get out
[59:53] there you you label and you pray and you
[59:55] study and do all these things and you
[59:57] get out there and start preaching and
[59:59] you feel
[1:00:00] resentment
[1:00:03] ohy because there's things going on in
[1:00:05] your life and I'm trying to Hallelujah
[1:00:08] set your life free Hallelujah but
[1:00:10] resentment is in the
[1:00:13] way or you come in and you trying to
[1:00:15] preach a Word of Deliverance Hallelujah
[1:00:18] but you feel the spirit of
[1:00:21] bondage because people got things in
[1:00:23] their lives they haven't been delivered
[1:00:28] from let me say I was in
[1:00:32] Canada
[1:00:34] and about 15 minutes before service
[1:00:38] service started at 7:00 and we got to
[1:00:41] church church was packed all the power
[1:00:44] went
[1:00:45] out all the power went out no air
[1:00:48] condition no nothing this is in the
[1:00:49] middle of the summer and you know I was
[1:00:52] in a hotel room the Lord was dealing
[1:00:53] with me
[1:00:55] I kept hearing a voice you know within
[1:00:57] my spirit saying prophetic
[1:01:00] anointing prophetic anointing and I'm
[1:01:02] thinking yeah I know see it's it's a
[1:01:04] mystery to me now cuz I'm I never heard
[1:01:07] those two words together you know I've
[1:01:09] heard prophetic word hallelujah you know
[1:01:11] a prophetic word he's gave a prophetic
[1:01:13] word you know and now I'm hearing
[1:01:16] prophetic anointing and you know church
[1:01:18] I was sitting there and I thinking
[1:01:19] prophetic anointing and then I get to
[1:01:21] church all the power goes out and I had
[1:01:24] this all the stuff that I wanted to
[1:01:26] preach and I wanted to lay out and I
[1:01:28] couldn't use none of it Hallelujah cuz
[1:01:30] the lights was out so now I got the I
[1:01:33] got the
[1:01:36] freestyle that's good
[1:01:38] Hallelujah see sometimes life will make
[1:01:42] you
[1:01:44] freestyle brother you might have this
[1:01:46] laid out and that laid out and God will
[1:01:48] let you go down a path Hallelujah where
[1:01:51] it looks like there is no Direction but
[1:01:54] let me tell you something God is still
[1:01:56] in control when the lights go out God is
[1:01:59] still in control when you have no more
[1:02:02] power God is still in
[1:02:04] control so it's all right for the lights
[1:02:07] to go out sometimes that's just God
[1:02:09] showing you that he's with
[1:02:12] you adjust your
[1:02:15] attitude so you know we was in there and
[1:02:18] and and if if we sit still long enough
[1:02:21] when we get in those situations where
[1:02:23] Hallelujah
[1:02:25] God is producing patience Hallelujah you
[1:02:28] get in those situations where you want
[1:02:30] to react so fast if you sit still long
[1:02:32] enough you'll see God is in the midst
[1:02:35] and you know Church the lights didn't
[1:02:36] went out we got no power no nothing and
[1:02:39] the pastor he was like oh my what we
[1:02:40] going to do you know and I'm thinking
[1:02:43] you know I wanted to put this quote up I
[1:02:44] wanted to say this I wanted to say that
[1:02:46] and I'm like man now I can't do none of
[1:02:48] that and it forced me to go sit down and
[1:02:51] lean even more on God
[1:02:55] [Applause]
[1:02:58] and sometimes God will cut your lights
[1:03:00] out yes sir cuz he want you to lean a
[1:03:03] little bit more Hallelujah I'm not
[1:03:05] saying that you're not leaning but he
[1:03:07] want you to lean a little bit more
[1:03:09] Hallelujah and you know if you lean
[1:03:11] Hallelujah completely on him that mean
[1:03:14] he is your support
[1:03:17] system and now the lights go out Church
[1:03:20] what are the chances what are the
[1:03:23] chances the light go house and there's a
[1:03:25] brother in that church who works on
[1:03:32] generators the lights go out and he has
[1:03:35] both of his generators at
[1:03:37] church Hallelujah both of his trucks are
[1:03:41] are are mobile generators so what they
[1:03:44] did they took cars and plugged up into
[1:03:46] his church trucks just to get the lights
[1:03:48] back on Hallelujah but they got the
[1:03:51] lights back on but there was no AC no
[1:03:53] nothing in the middle of the summer so
[1:03:55] we started preaching we started having
[1:03:57] church church you can tell when God is
[1:03:59] in the building yes because when God is
[1:04:03] in the building your flesh goes out the
[1:04:10] window Hallelujah and I challenge you
[1:04:13] tonight if God is in the building you
[1:04:15] won't feel tired you won't feel lazy you
[1:04:19] won't feel disinterested but you'll get
[1:04:21] a charge from somewhere because you feel
[1:04:23] it's
[1:04:30] presence so good this brother while I
[1:04:32] was preaching a brother plugged up a fan
[1:04:36] and I wasn't
[1:04:37] hot even the pastor he say he was
[1:04:39] sitting there when he cut the fan on he
[1:04:41] was like I ain't got cut the fan off
[1:04:45] it's making too much
[1:04:47] noise see In God's Presence the mystery
[1:04:52] of life becomes so simple
[1:04:56] the things that you think you might need
[1:04:58] you really don't need to serve him
[1:05:02] Hallelujah and we had church and the
[1:05:05] anointing of God came down and the
[1:05:08] anointing was so prophetic God was doing
[1:05:10] things in people's life that they've
[1:05:12] been waiting to see Hallelujah parents
[1:05:14] and their children at the altar praying
[1:05:17] together rejoicing together worshiping
[1:05:19] together all because the Lights Went
[1:05:23] Out
[1:05:24] [Applause]
[1:05:26] GL but those who are in the flesh they
[1:05:28] look at at they saying man we ain't got
[1:05:29] no lights yes we did Jesus is the light
[1:05:32] of the world
[1:05:36] hallu yes church do you realize when the
[1:05:40] lights go out certain parts of your body
[1:05:43] react Hallelujah for
[1:05:46] more Hallelujah GL if we cut the lights
[1:05:50] out right now your peoples will get
[1:05:52] bigger come on
[1:05:56] cuz there's something about us that's
[1:05:58] not meant to stay in the
[1:06:03] [Applause]
[1:06:06] darkness but look God tells Abraham
[1:06:10] you're going to have a son you're going
[1:06:11] to have a child we know the story
[1:06:13] Abraham and Sarah they laugh and then
[1:06:15] Sarah tries to produce this life without
[1:06:21] God the mystery to be revealed will
[1:06:24] always be revealed Under the Umbrella of
[1:06:27] God's
[1:06:28] hands that's good and then church they
[1:06:31] get to the place where they be they just
[1:06:33] begin to live now I'm going to say some
[1:06:36] things that's going to be challenging
[1:06:37] for you because when we look at
[1:06:40] ourselves we look at ourselves as let's
[1:06:42] make sure we got all our ex's cross and
[1:06:44] our te's cross and dots and all these
[1:06:47] things and I'm a Christian come on come
[1:06:51] on come on remember that quote
[1:06:55] when a prophet of God said what made it
[1:06:57] a
[1:06:58] masterpiece that's so good bring it now
[1:07:02] it was the flaw
[1:07:04] hallelujah
[1:07:07] hallelujah it was the flaw that made
[1:07:10] that statue of Moses a masterpiece H cuz
[1:07:14] even with the flaw in it everything that
[1:07:17] was in Michelangelo's mind was still in
[1:07:19] front of
[1:07:22] him whoa boy that's heavy right there
[1:07:24] boy woo even with the flaw in the hu
[1:07:28] even with the flaw in the Statue it
[1:07:30] still revealed everything that was in
[1:07:33] the sculptor's
[1:07:35] mind so even with all your flaws you'll
[1:07:38] still reveal everything that God has in
[1:07:41] his mind concerning
[1:07:45] you yeah we make mistakes praise God
[1:07:48] hallelujah see it's the fla that shows I
[1:07:52] am a child of God the prophet of God
[1:07:54] said a righteous man is not a sinless
[1:07:58] man
[1:08:02] on on yeah I know you thought it was the
[1:08:05] other way around no uhuh he said a
[1:08:09] righteous man is not a sinless man he
[1:08:11] said what makes him righteous is that
[1:08:13] he's confessing the blood of Jesus
[1:08:15] Christ hallelujah hallelujah the Bible
[1:08:19] said a righteous man does what falls
[1:08:22] seven times
[1:08:24] come
[1:08:25] on but he gets back
[1:08:28] up see that's the Mystery of
[1:08:30] Life falling down and getting back up to
[1:08:34] what complete what was started in
[1:08:37] God
[1:08:39] hallelujah but life is full of Cycles
[1:08:43] sir and you have to right now be able to
[1:08:45] catch the cycle you're
[1:08:47] in you know in the Book of Genesis when
[1:08:50] Joseph Hallelujah was when he made his
[1:08:53] way to the
[1:08:57] throne his life was a
[1:09:02] mystery a mystery of
[1:09:04] pain that's right but not reflected in
[1:09:08] his
[1:09:12] life everything he went through pain
[1:09:15] struggle pain struggle but when you saw
[1:09:18] Joseph you didn't see that that's right
[1:09:21] you saw a man that love God how could
[1:09:24] you see that cuz he kept living good
[1:09:27] preaching come on now and if you keep
[1:09:29] living your pain won't get the best of
[1:09:32] you if you keep living your struggle
[1:09:35] won't get the best of you all it can do
[1:09:37] is lead you right to your purpose and
[1:09:40] position in Christ hallelujah what
[1:09:44] started Joseph's Journey jealousy that's
[1:09:48] right you mean to tell me the mystery of
[1:09:51] his life being revealed started with
[1:09:53] hatred and
[1:09:57] jealousy you said no brother digs he had
[1:10:00] a dream that his sheep and their she and
[1:10:02] they was going to bow down no uhuh that
[1:10:05] wasn't the start of it that was just the
[1:10:07] dream the start of it was when they sold
[1:10:10] him into slavery yes sir that's right
[1:10:12] and then he had to live Hallelujah to
[1:10:15] catch up with what he dreamed
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:22] oh Hallelujah yeah and there are some
[1:10:25] things that are prophesied in this Bible
[1:10:27] there are some things that are
[1:10:28] prophesied in this message and it's time
[1:10:30] for you and I to catch up to
[1:10:34] it it's time to catch up to be that
[1:10:37] church Hallelujah without a spot blemish
[1:10:39] Oro hallelujah it's time for that church
[1:10:42] to catch up with the prophet of God was
[1:10:44] saying when she recognizes who she
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:48] is she'll be an invincible
[1:10:52] Army
[1:10:55] Hallelujah good church good preach so we
[1:10:59] got the lights back on we had service of
[1:11:01] powerful service the week after that I
[1:11:04] went to South
[1:11:05] Africa first service lights go out
[1:11:09] again but that prophetic anointing was
[1:11:11] there
[1:11:15] too so what God was doing for me was
[1:11:18] telling me don't
[1:11:21] panic this is the way I get all eyes
[1:11:23] focused on
[1:11:25] me cuz you know when you have meetings
[1:11:27] you have joint services and you have
[1:11:29] things that you've done for years and
[1:11:31] years and you get in there sometimes
[1:11:33] it's just a traditional
[1:11:35] program and you know what starting to
[1:11:37] get on my nerves we have these annual
[1:11:39] meetings and things we've been having
[1:11:40] for years and years and nobody get
[1:11:42] closer to
[1:11:44] Christ people come in church with
[1:11:47] spirits in their life walk out with
[1:11:48] spirits in their life people come in
[1:11:50] church depressed walk out depressed
[1:11:53] people come in in church struggle walk
[1:11:54] out still struggling when are we going
[1:11:57] to get over the hump to where when
[1:12:00] demons get around us they get
[1:12:06] uncomfortable Hallelujah they get
[1:12:09] uncomfortable either they say hallelujah
[1:12:11] church we had a service and the power of
[1:12:13] God started falling down in the place
[1:12:16] Hallelujah those Hallelujah who didn't
[1:12:18] know God they started running out of the
[1:12:21] church because demons started
[1:12:24] manifesting
[1:12:27] wow that and that was just the mystery
[1:12:30] of life being
[1:12:32] revealed H there's something in you
[1:12:35] tonight and let me say it like this this
[1:12:38] word I'm preaching is going to bring it
[1:12:43] out it's going to bring it out
[1:12:45] Hallelujah in a way tonight to set you
[1:12:47] free or it's going to bring it out in a
[1:12:49] way to provoke
[1:12:51] you Hallelujah to challenge what I'm
[1:12:55] saying and Abraham and Sarah hallelujah
[1:12:59] how do they know the path of life and
[1:13:02] look church as they walked and as they
[1:13:04] live Hallelujah Abraham found himself
[1:13:08] doing things that the father Faith
[1:13:10] shouldn't have been doing all right
[1:13:14] that's good first things first Abraham
[1:13:17] gets out who knew God would call the
[1:13:19] father Faith with a Lyon spirit inside
[1:13:22] of them
[1:13:25] that's good but that had to be revealed
[1:13:27] so Abraham can go to the next
[1:13:30] stage so what God will do he'll let us
[1:13:32] go through things that things that may
[1:13:34] be weighed down inside of us that's
[1:13:37] still there connected to your sticky
[1:13:39] nature that trial will bring it out so
[1:13:42] you can move
[1:13:43] [Music]
[1:13:45] on Hallelujah don't feel bad Hallelujah
[1:13:49] God is using that to uncover a mystery
[1:13:52] of life
[1:13:53] hallah and God used that Hallelujah put
[1:13:57] Abraham in a position where he
[1:14:00] lied just so God could come in and stand
[1:14:03] beside
[1:14:07] him are you reading your
[1:14:10] Bible God didn't leave him when he told
[1:14:12] a lie God God came and defended
[1:14:18] him that was a part of the mystery how
[1:14:21] could God defend a Li it wasn't the LIE
[1:14:25] he was defending it was the promise he
[1:14:27] told him he was defending
[1:14:31] Hallelujah so as you walk and you live
[1:14:33] and you believe you might make mistakes
[1:14:36] but God will always stand beside his
[1:14:40] promise God will always come and defend
[1:14:43] his promise so if you make mistakes
[1:14:46] Hallelujah don't stay there keep on
[1:14:48] stepping Keep On Walking keep on living
[1:14:51] I promise you God will do his part
[1:14:53] yes sir yes
[1:14:56] sir he he said God defeated a liar no
[1:15:00] God defeated his
[1:15:04] word and then he goes to the king he
[1:15:07] says Hey give her back to Abraham and
[1:15:11] you go to let my Lyon Prophet pray for
[1:15:16] you see God has a way of doing things
[1:15:20] that's why we have to adjust the way we
[1:15:22] look at our trials and our tribulations
[1:15:24] Hallelujah because there's always
[1:15:26] something greater coming out of it
[1:15:29] Hallelujah because life is being
[1:15:31] revealed and you know Church from that
[1:15:34] point Abraham told a boldfaced lie you
[1:15:37] know why so he'd never have to do it
[1:15:43] again that's good once God uncovered it
[1:15:47] it was sitting way down there once God
[1:15:50] uncovered it Abraham never had time to
[1:15:53] lie
[1:15:54] again because God came in and showed
[1:15:56] Abraham I'm still here with you even in
[1:16:00] your faults even in your failures even
[1:16:02] in your error I'm still here with you so
[1:16:05] you don't have to lie just
[1:16:08] believe Hallelujah and what I'm saying
[1:16:11] tonight Church you don't have to run
[1:16:13] from God just continue to live and walk
[1:16:15] God will stand by your side if you
[1:16:19] believe Hallelujah and from that point
[1:16:22] Hallelujah God always showed up
[1:16:24] Hallelujah Abraham went out to fight
[1:16:26] three kings Hallelujah with 316 or 18
[1:16:34] servants but it took him coming through
[1:16:36] a lie to get to that place where he
[1:16:38] could trust God prise God because all
[1:16:42] the way up to that place God gave oh my
[1:16:44] church listen to this God will give you
[1:16:47] a word and speak a word in your life
[1:16:50] knowing that in that moment you don't
[1:16:52] believe it

[1:17:02] heavy think about that sir
[1:17:06] church he gave promises to different
[1:17:08] ones in the scripture knowing that in
[1:17:11] that moment they were going to go
[1:17:13] through certain things that didn't make
[1:17:14] them look like believers they were going
[1:17:17] to go through things that were going to
[1:17:18] question whether they were Servants of
[1:17:20] God or not Hallelujah God his first
[1:17:24] reason for choosing David was a man at
[1:17:26] his very own heart but the cycle of Life
[1:17:29] led him to
[1:17:34] adultery that was in his
[1:17:37] path and that was something he had to
[1:17:40] overcome Hallelujah so God let him go
[1:17:43] down that path go down that way why just
[1:17:47] so he could conquer
[1:17:50] it and God lets us go down certain ways
[1:17:53] certain Avenues certain roads just so we
[1:17:56] could become
[1:17:57] conquerors amen no I'm not condoning sin
[1:18:01] Hallelujah the Bible says great is the
[1:18:04] mystery of
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:07] godliness so getting to that point of
[1:18:10] perfection is a mystery getting to that
[1:18:12] point Hallelujah where the attributes of
[1:18:15] God is coming out of you it's a mystery
[1:18:17] what is it it's life being lived
[1:18:21] amen hallelujah but we have to
[1:18:23] understand the Cycles Hallelujah don't
[1:18:25] get nervous I ain't going to be too much
[1:18:27] longer that's good brother but we have
[1:18:29] to understand the cycles and how God do
[1:18:31] things look God will speak a word or
[1:18:34] give you a position knowing you ain't
[1:18:37] ready for
[1:18:39] it I ain't talking about position in the
[1:18:41] church I'm talking position in the word
[1:18:44] he'll give you a word pronounce it in
[1:18:46] your life knowing that you don't
[1:18:48] understand it you ain't ready for it
[1:18:50] yet you said BR d what what what you
[1:18:53] talking
[1:18:54] about he walks up to the disciples and
[1:18:58] what he's doing he's testing their life
[1:19:00] he walks up to them he says who do men
[1:19:03] say that I
[1:19:04] am he want to know what do they think
[1:19:06] about life he said who do men say the
[1:19:09] some say Jeremiah some say Isaiah or one
[1:19:11] of the prophets but then he says who do
[1:19:14] you say I am and Peter says Thou Are the
[1:19:18] Christ the son of the Living God and now
[1:19:21] Jesus is feend too speaking to his life
[1:19:25] he's going to uncover a mystery about
[1:19:27] Peter that none of the other disciples
[1:19:29] had ever heard before H he said Peter
[1:19:32] Flesh and Blood have not revealed Us in
[1:19:35] you but my Father which is in heaven and
[1:19:37] he says by this Hallelujah I'm going to
[1:19:39] build my church and then Christ comes
[1:19:43] down Hallelujah to give him Authority
[1:19:46] Hallelujah that he ain't even ready for
[1:19:48] he said whatsoever you shall bound on
[1:19:50] Earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:19:52] whatsoever you shall loose on Earth
[1:19:54] shall be loose in heaven do y'all
[1:19:57] understand Peter wasn't ready for that
[1:19:59] but God gave him that Authority you know
[1:20:01] how he got there he had to walk and do
[1:20:05] it said brother what do you mean
[1:20:08] remember Jesus told Peter now after he
[1:20:10] told him that Hallelujah scripture says
[1:20:12] and he gave him the keys to the kingdom
[1:20:15] he wasn't even ready for the Keys of the
[1:20:16] Kingdom but God had gave it to
[1:20:21] him
[1:20:25] I I I I hope I hope your hands are
[1:20:26] getting real
[1:20:28] itchy cuz I'm trying to give out some
[1:20:30] things that Christ has already given to
[1:20:33] us he's gave him position he gave him a
[1:20:36] word of authority that Peter could even
[1:20:38] believe yet he wasn't even ready yet but
[1:20:41] one thing about God once he speaking it
[1:20:43] can't come
[1:20:45] back once he giv it to you he can't take
[1:20:47] it back what it comes from your heart to
[1:20:50] his heart he can't take it back
[1:20:52] Hallelujah
[1:20:56] look how does Peter get there he has to
[1:20:58] walk into that Revelation he has to walk
[1:21:01] into that mystery being revealed but
[1:21:03] look church he God gave him all that
[1:21:05] spoke all that into his life and then he
[1:21:07] says to Peter Hallelujah Peter are you
[1:21:10] going to follow me yes Lord I'mma follow
[1:21:11] you every I'm do everything I'm going be
[1:21:13] with you all the time I believe this

[1:21:17] co going to cry three times and you

[1:21:34] whatsoever you bind is going to be bound
[1:21:37] whatsoever you loose is going to be
[1:21:38] loose and then he gets there Hallelujah
[1:21:41] and afraid to be identified with
[1:21:43] Christ when he already had the power to
[1:21:46] bind

[1:23:00] right now while the word of God is being
[1:23:02] preached will be the same thing you'll
[1:23:03] be doing on the shores of Galilee with

[1:23:18] shores you can't fool life amen life has
[1:23:23] to be lived in our church he gets there
[1:23:26] and he says I I know not the
[1:23:29] man that was
[1:23:31] once I thought he had the power to bind
[1:23:34] I thought he had the power to loose I
[1:23:36] thought he had the keys to the kingdom
[1:23:38] amen come on I thought he had the
[1:23:40] revelation of Jesus Christ that the
[1:23:43] church was being built upon but now
[1:23:46] Hallelujah he's having a struggle with
[1:23:48] being identified with what God said he
[1:23:51] is
[1:23:54] what a mystery yes sir oh my sometimes
[1:23:59] Hallelujah we question our walk with God
[1:24:02] that's right Lord why am I going through
[1:24:04] this I I thought I was a servant I
[1:24:06] thought I was your son and this and that
[1:24:08] you got to keep
[1:24:10] walking
[1:24:11] Hallelujah life is full of things that

[1:24:17] it's up to God to make it clear
[1:24:20] hallelujah amen hallelujah it's not up
[1:24:23] to us to make it clear it's up to Christ
[1:24:25] to make it clear that's why we call him
[1:24:28] savior that's why we call him Lord
[1:24:31] that's why we call him healer Hallelujah
[1:24:34] if you're not healed tonight it's not up
[1:24:36] to you it's up to
[1:24:38] Christ you just have to keep walking
[1:24:41] keep living life but the key to it is
[1:24:45] you have to do it in
[1:24:50] Joy cuz m Ing and complaining or get you
[1:24:54] coming to that same spot for 40
[1:25:02] years y'all think the journey in the
[1:25:04] wilderness they were just going over
[1:25:06] hills and mountains and going all over
[1:25:08] this place they were going in
[1:25:12] circles in their attitude they kept
[1:25:14] bypassing the
[1:25:19] exit get back to the exit again and they
[1:25:21] added UD still the
[1:25:26] same they get to the exit again the
[1:25:29] attitude still the same so God kept the
[1:25:31] exit closed
[1:25:34] up why because they wouldn't let the
[1:25:37] life be lived they wouldn't let it be
[1:25:40] revealed in Christ they're stuck on what
[1:25:43] they was in
[1:25:46] Egypt that's so good oh my that's so
[1:25:49] good oh my
[1:25:51] Hallelujah but God will speak things
[1:25:53] into our lives knowing we're not ready
[1:25:55] for it just so he can come and stand
[1:25:57] beside
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:02] us oh my church that's what he did with
[1:26:05] Peter he told Peter the COO cck three
[1:26:08] times you going to deny me all that
[1:26:10] Peter said man no no Lord not me I'm
[1:26:12] with you I got the
[1:26:15] Revelation and then they start putting
[1:26:17] pressure on his life the journey started
[1:26:20] putting pressure on him h maybe some of
[1:26:23] us our family members putting pressure
[1:26:24] on us by the church we go to or what we
[1:26:27] believe and brandit and all this other
[1:26:29] foolishness and nonsense trying to put
[1:26:32] pressure on us but pressure is what lets
[1:26:35] you know that the baby is about to be
[1:26:39] delivered let's make sure we looking at
[1:26:41] it right Hallelujah I wonder how many of
[1:26:45] you sisters ever had a baby with no

[1:26:51] got some aliens in here
[1:26:55] brother we got some aliens in here you
[1:26:57] say brother why would you say that
[1:26:59] because if you can have a baby without
[1:27:01] any pressure you will break the
[1:27:05] scripture that's so good Hallelujah God
[1:27:08] say a woman got to have baby child birth
[1:27:10] in pain Hallelujah so that's a part of
[1:27:13] the mystery of life being revealed
[1:27:15] Hallelujah pain is a part of you being
[1:27:18] in God's
[1:27:19] will ohen
[1:27:25] Peter not even
[1:27:26] ready for what God pronouncing is like

[1:27:31] for what God pronounced in his life and
[1:27:34] he comes and he says I know not the man
[1:27:36] then they come back to him again and say
[1:27:38] take go one there he said I know not the
[1:27:39] man and the third time they come they
[1:27:41] say yeah that's what there Peter say
[1:27:45] you
[1:27:47] you I told
[1:27:51] y'all
[1:27:53] come on he had to let Peter go through
[1:27:56] that to get that cussing demon out of
[1:27:59] him that's a good

[1:47:42] a
[1:47:42] manifestation

[1:47:53] close but the cycle of life there's a
[1:47:57] cycle that we all benefit benefit from
[1:48:00] but if you look real good you can see
[1:48:02] the mystery of Christ being revealed in
[1:48:04] it you look you take the first stage of
[1:48:09] life which is the mineral Life water and
[1:48:13] sand and and all these things and it
[1:48:15] seems
[1:48:17] insignificant but water and sand is
[1:48:20] needed for the next stage of life which
[1:48:23] is plant
[1:48:24] life that's right you can't have plants
[1:48:27] without water and
[1:48:28] sand plants need what dirt
[1:48:33] right every seed needs
[1:48:38] dirt every promise in your life needs

[1:48:46] said before the dirt in our life is good
[1:48:49] dirt right amen hallelujah this the kind
[1:48:53] of dirt they build houses on this the
[1:48:56] kind of dirt they plant foundations on
[1:48:58] that's right Hallelujah but look
[1:49:01] Hallelujah mineral Kingdom makes room
[1:49:04] for plant life the plant kingdom
[1:49:06] Hallelujah the plant kingdom makes room
[1:49:09] for the animal kingdom Hallelujah
[1:49:11] because the animals eat the plants which
[1:49:13] the plants eat the minerals Hallelujah
[1:49:15] and then hallelujah the animal kingdoms
[1:49:17] make room for who us the human beings
[1:49:20] amen because we eat the animals and
[1:49:23] while we eat the animals we eat the
[1:49:24] plants and we drink the water Hallelujah
[1:49:27] all the kingdoms are survived in us
[1:49:30] hallelujah but then it don't stop
[1:49:32] there's another kingdom what is it the
[1:49:34] kingdom of
[1:49:35] [Applause]
[1:49:38] God W so it all Hallelujah is revealed
[1:49:42] in Christ every human every animal every
[1:49:46] plant even the water is identified in
[1:49:48] him he said said you drink of me you'll
[1:49:51] never thirst
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:54] again he called him Hallelujah he's
[1:49:57] identified in every Kingdom In The Water
[1:49:59] Kingdom Hallelujah he says I am that
[1:50:02] Living Water oh my you go to the plant
[1:50:04] kingdom he says I'm the lily of the
[1:50:06] valley the rose of Sharon you go to the
[1:50:10] Animal Kingdom he says I'm the lion of
[1:50:12] the tribe of Judah
[1:50:14] hallah he says I'm the dove I'm Jehovah
[1:50:19] eagle
[1:50:22] [Applause]
[1:50:24] you go to the human Kingdom he says when
[1:50:27] you see me you see the father
[1:50:30] [Applause]
[1:50:31] hallelujah oh
[1:50:34] my and then when you go to the Godlike
[1:50:36] Kingdom he says let us make man how in
[1:50:40] our image in our
[1:50:42] likeness everything about this world is
[1:50:45] revealed where in the mystery of
[1:50:49] life
[1:50:51] amen and you are that
[1:50:54] mystery
[1:50:56] revealed woo oh my oh my church let's
[1:51:01] not be discouraged but let's be glad
[1:51:04] about what God is doing church I want
[1:51:07] you to understand pain struggle brings
[1:51:11] out who you really
[1:51:14] are and it may happen at an unexpected
[1:51:16] time or unexpected moment where you
[1:51:18] ain't even ready for it and it just
[1:51:20] happens why because God is bringing out
[1:51:22] who you really are look Church job
[1:51:25] wasn't ready for it it was just a
[1:51:27] bet it was a bet between God and Satan
[1:51:30] Hallelujah but then once he got in it
[1:51:32] the mystery of who he was started to be
[1:51:35] revealed Hallelujah he's going through a
[1:51:38] hard trial lost his money lost his
[1:51:40] cattle lost his family his wife saying
[1:51:42] his breath don't smell good all these
[1:51:44] things he wasn't expecting none of that
[1:51:46] but then when they asked job what's
[1:51:48] going on job said blessed be the name of
[1:51:51] the
[1:51:53] Lord wo what was the church he kept
[1:51:59] living oh my and then he started
[1:52:01] pointing out his trials he started
[1:52:03] putting his trials in a good light
[1:52:05] instead of a bad light he told his wife
[1:52:07] he said hey do you expect to see all
[1:52:10] good and no evil at the hand of the
[1:52:18] Lord oh my the more the trial went on
[1:52:22] the more the mystery of his life came
[1:52:26] out sure and that's what it should be
[1:52:29] for you guys that's what it should be
[1:52:31] for us the more we test it the more we
[1:52:34] try the more we come into the image of
[1:52:37] Christ but don't be afraid to keep
[1:52:40] living I know it's probably been what
[1:52:42] about a year since I've been up here
[1:52:44] maybe about a
[1:52:46] year it's a lot didn't happen since then
[1:52:52] I have a grandson turning one next
[1:52:57] week and I'm seeing so much in
[1:53:01] him I'm seeing how at first he could
[1:53:04] only recognize his mother's
[1:53:07] voice you know he was comfortable with
[1:53:09] her voice right you know because they
[1:53:12] had such a connection when he was in the
[1:53:15] womb what was that connection love
[1:53:18] Hallelujah see the connection of
[1:53:20] conception should be based upon love not
[1:53:24] the physical touch it should be upon
[1:53:26] love Hallelujah because when that woman
[1:53:28] begins to carry that baby she's carrying
[1:53:30] a token of love so she can adjust to all
[1:53:34] the pains she can adjust to how
[1:53:36] everything Hallelujah makes her walk
[1:53:38] different and what she has to eat
[1:53:40] different all everything she does
[1:53:41] different why because she loves what's
[1:53:43] being develop inside talk to me
[1:53:47] sisters Hallelujah but then Hallelujah
[1:53:50] there Comes A Time Hallelujah where
[1:53:52] what's inside begins to inflict
[1:53:56] pain
[1:53:57] W oh my if you don't give it what it
[1:54:00] want it'll start to kick inside the womb
[1:54:05] when it's hungry it'll start to kick if
[1:54:07] you feeding the wrong thing it'll spit
[1:54:09] it all back up Hallelujah Church what
[1:54:11] are you saying brother digs that life
[1:54:13] inside of you you have to give it what
[1:54:15] it
[1:54:16] wants I'm talking about the Life of
[1:54:19] Christ now
[1:54:20] you have to give it what it wants
[1:54:21] because if you don't you're going to be
[1:54:23] sick down here living
[1:54:29] life but then it comes a time n months
[1:54:32] later where the baby is ready to be
[1:54:34] revealed and develop Hallelujah and she
[1:54:37] goes through pains labor pains and then
[1:54:39] she delivers the baby only to never
[1:54:42] remember those pains again unless she's
[1:54:44] asked about it
[1:54:47] right sisters don't be talking about
[1:54:49] about that pain unless you ask them
[1:54:50] about it they don't look at their
[1:54:52] children and say man you had me in labor
[1:54:54] for n
[1:54:56] hours they don't do that till you make
[1:54:58] them
[1:55:01] mad they don't even remember the pain
[1:55:03] when they look at you all they just see
[1:55:05] is what's been delivered am amen The Joy
[1:55:09] Hallelujah of something Hallelujah
[1:55:12] coming from
[1:55:14] you my and then church this is this is
[1:55:17] the greatest stage not about to close
[1:55:19] but as you see that child that child I
[1:55:22] see my grandson he starts to
[1:55:24] crawl but you know our expectation
[1:55:27] crawling is all right we can't wait till
[1:55:29] he can walk cuz we know that's the
[1:55:32] potential of the child Hallelujah
[1:55:34] crawling is the stage Hallelujah but
[1:55:36] what we looking for is them steps but we
[1:55:39] have to let them crawl because crawling
[1:55:42] is what builds them up to have strength
[1:55:44] enough to stand up on his own so we have
[1:55:47] to let him crawl and I'm here to let you
[1:55:49] know God has to let us crawl Hallelujah
[1:55:53] because crawl is what makes us strong
[1:55:55] enough to stand up on our
[1:55:57] own and as that child gets strong enough
[1:56:00] crawling then it'll start pulling up on
[1:56:02] his own standing up and looking at you
[1:56:07] smiling what is he saying get everything
[1:56:10] out of my reach
[1:56:11] H Church natural types are spiritual
[1:56:15] once you start to stand up on your own
[1:56:17] then you can reach out and grab what you
[1:56:20] need Hallelujah the things of God that
[1:56:23] are in your reach now you can reach out
[1:56:25] and grab it you don't need no help Satan
[1:56:28] better get out your
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:35] way Hallelujah and he go through the
[1:56:38] house and he say put everything up high
[1:56:41] not even realizing that he's growing you
[1:56:43] going to have to put it up higher and
[1:56:45] higher and higher and
[1:56:48] higher
[1:56:50] that's why we go in church Satan wants
[1:56:53] these things to be out of our reach but
[1:56:54] we're growing Higher and Higher and
[1:56:57] Higher and
[1:57:00] Higher and if I can't reach it naturally
[1:57:03] I'll stand up on
[1:57:07] something Hallelujah yes sir and if I
[1:57:11] can't do it by myself I get somebody to
[1:57:13] help
[1:57:16] meall yes sir
[1:57:18] oh but then it's going to come a day
[1:57:22] H I'm about to
[1:57:24] close when you see that
[1:57:27] child just all by
[1:57:29] himself standing
[1:57:31] up and it's become so natural to him
[1:57:35] he's not even realizing that he's
[1:57:37] standing up on his
[1:57:39] own and like some of us you look at that
[1:57:43] child and you catch him standing up and
[1:57:46] he say hey boy come here boy
[1:57:57] ain't ready yet but got all the
[1:58:00] potential to do it h so what do you do
[1:58:03] you keep encouraging him to walk
[1:58:06] hallelujah hallelujah what God does he
[1:58:09] grabs Us by the hand and he walks us out
[1:58:11] there to it Hallelujah let you know you
[1:58:13] ain't by yourself come on let's do this
[1:58:16] together Hallelujah he rocks you out
[1:58:18] Kayla walks you right out there to it
[1:58:20] Hallelujah and let you know you are more
[1:58:23] than able to do it but what happens
[1:58:26] Hallelujah when that child falls down
[1:58:28] what do you do you pick them back up and
[1:58:29] you say do it again hallelujah it's the
[1:58:32] falling down that gives that child
[1:58:35] [Applause]
[1:58:40] confidence come on musicians I'm
[1:58:42] closing it's the falling Downs in
[1:58:46] life that gives us confidence to trust
[1:58:48] God
[1:58:50] yeah the scripture we read is there
[1:58:52] anything too hard for
[1:58:56] God in my
[1:58:59] closing I get to think about the
[1:59:02] butterfly the caterpillar
[1:59:05] rather in the early stages of his life
[1:59:08] cycle it crawls everywhere it
[1:59:16] goes it even looks ridiculous
[1:59:19] you look at the calip you be
[1:59:23] like poor
[1:59:27] thing right but that's the stage of life
[1:59:30] it's in that's right it looks like such
[1:59:32] a
[1:59:33] struggle it looks like it's such a
[1:59:35] struggle but that's the stage it's in it
[1:59:39] it would much rather go around some
[1:59:40] things but it has to crawl over it it
[1:59:43] wouldn't even want to touch it but it
[1:59:44] has to touch it that's the only way it
[1:59:46] can get there and some of you are in a
[1:59:48] caterpillar stage
[1:59:52] you wish you didn't have to touch it but
[1:59:53] you got to touch it you wish you could
[1:59:55] go around it but you got to go through
[1:59:57] it because that's the stage and you're
[1:59:59] just so tired of touching it you're just
[2:00:01] so tired of coming into it but keep
[2:00:03] living Hallelujah because what you don't
[2:00:05] realize Hallelujah you know what I don't
[2:00:08] believe this just me I don't believe
[2:00:11] that that caterpillar has an expectation
[2:00:14] for a
[2:00:17] cocoon come on
[2:00:20] it just lives Hallelujah and then
[2:00:23] there's a time and a season where it
[2:00:25] comes into a change and it looks very
[2:00:28] ugly Hallelujah this change is very ugly
[2:00:31] but something is happening inside W
[2:00:34] Hallelujah something is happening inside
[2:00:37] that trial of Life something is
[2:00:39] happening Hallelujah that's going to
[2:00:41] project what
[2:00:43] Grace W Hallelujah and it lays in that
[2:00:46] cocoon for a certain amount of time what
[2:00:48] got it into that cocoon its own
[2:00:53] struggles the struggles of Life got into
[2:00:55] the Cocoon and now in the Cocoon what is
[2:00:58] it doing to that cocoon it's going
[2:01:00] through a
[2:01:01] mystery that is so good yes
[2:01:04] sir nobody can see the
[2:01:08] colors nobody can see the
[2:01:11] wings nobody can see the development in
[2:01:13] it Hallelujah everything is hidden and
[2:01:16] revealed in that ugly filthy cocoon
[2:01:22] and we looking at I don't I don't know
[2:01:24] if they bride they might they might be
[2:01:26] sery look what they did they just in
[2:01:28] something so filthy and nasty hold on
[2:01:32] hold on there's something going to come
[2:01:34] out of that hold on God is up to
[2:01:37] something hold on church then next thing
[2:01:39] you know you see a crack of a wing come
[2:01:42] out pushing out of that field H then you
[2:01:45] see another one kind of push out of the
[2:01:47] field they think know something
[2:01:49] beautiful buses out Hallelujah and it
[2:01:52] never lives life like that again
[2:01:55] Hallelujah Now everywhere it goes
[2:01:58] Hallelujah it flies everywhere it goes
[2:02:01] what is it reflecting it's reflecting
[2:02:07] Grace everywhere it goes it's reflecting
[2:02:10] Grace it's reflecting the change of
[2:02:14] life and that's what we
[2:02:17] want we want Hall
[2:02:19] the mystery of Grace to be revealed in
[2:02:21] our lives Hallelujah no we don't have
[2:02:25] all the answers but just keep living

[2:02:31] of
[2:02:31] it trust me I've lived in the world and

[2:02:51] testimony
