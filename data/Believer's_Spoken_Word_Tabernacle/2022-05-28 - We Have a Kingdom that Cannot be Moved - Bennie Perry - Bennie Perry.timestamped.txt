[49:06] 11
[49:11] and verse
[49:13] 25.
[49:15] that you refuse not him that's speaketh
[49:19] for if they escape not who refuse him
[49:21] that spake on earth
[49:23] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[49:26] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[49:30] whose voice then shook the earth
[49:33] but now he said he has promised saying
[49:36] yet once more
[49:38] i shake not the earth only
[49:40] but also the heavens
[49:42] and this
[49:43] word
[49:44] yet once more signifies the removing of
[49:48] those things that are shaken
[49:51] as of things that are made that those
[49:54] things which cannot be shaken
[49:56] may remain wherefore we have received a
[49:59] kingdom

[1:02:12] revelation
[1:02:13] importance of revelation by the spirit

[1:02:46] no matter how many people say it ain't
[1:02:47] working go ahead a true revelation to a
[1:02:50] believer can never be overemphasized if
[1:02:52] god said it then i stay with it

[1:02:58] good god said i'm healed i don't care
[1:03:00] how sick i get
[1:03:02] the bible says i'm healed

[1:03:16] glory i like that the lady got sick
[1:03:19] brother brown they took her to the
[1:03:20] doctor
[1:03:21] and they couldn't find nothing wrong
[1:03:23] with her but when they took it in front
[1:03:24] of the word
[1:03:26] and brother branham looked at her he
[1:03:27] said satan you hear it from the doctor
[1:03:30] but you can't hide from god
[1:03:32] and he cast that devil out he was in the
[1:03:34] full dimension still before he even got
[1:03:36] out he wanted to come but god sent him
[1:03:38] back the way he was and what we need
[1:03:40] today is genuine sons and daughters of
[1:03:43] god god listen listen i always say to
[1:03:45] the church people there's two sides
[1:03:48] there's a natural
[1:03:50] and there's a corner
[1:03:51] to be carnally minded
[1:03:54] is death but to be spiritual minded
[1:03:56] glory is life and peace
[1:03:59] everything can be going wrong
[1:04:01] you have peace

[1:04:05] peace why because he's a principle

[1:04:23] been man do it for a night but joy comes
[1:04:25] in the morning

[1:04:29] in revelation there they would have
[1:04:31] tribulation

[1:05:53] system that god placed in you the word

[1:06:07] fool for christ
[1:06:09] everybody was laughing looking at her
[1:06:11] but on his back of his shirt when he
[1:06:13] walked by he said who fooled you
[1:06:16] if you don't be a fool for jesus you're
[1:06:19] going to be somebody's food somebody's
[1:06:21] going to make a fool so you might want
[1:06:23] to let jesus do it
[1:06:25] we have received a kingdom that cannot
[1:06:27] be moved we haven't seen the words
[1:06:31] listen we were talking
[1:06:33] the other day
[1:06:35] brother brandon preached the authority
[1:06:36] of god's word how many never heard that
[1:06:38] message
[1:06:39] he said gloria listen i want you to say
[1:06:41] the authority of god's word
[1:06:43] is not the authority of you
[1:06:45] it's the authority of god's word amen so
[1:06:47] if you can make god you can make the
[1:06:49] word fail didn't you make god fail
[1:06:51] and it's impossible
[1:06:53] impossible for god to fail he can't lie
[1:06:57] he can't fail
[1:06:58] i don't care how many bad things go
[1:07:00] wrong in your life
[1:07:02] it don't make no difference god's word
[1:07:04] the authority of the word it would bring
[1:07:06] everything subject glory
[1:07:09] it would bring everything subject to the
[1:07:11] holy ghost
[1:07:11] [Applause]
[1:07:13] in the beginning
[1:07:15] it didn't say at the beginning it's
[1:07:17] different
[1:07:18] in the beginning
[1:07:20] was the word
[1:07:22] and the word was with god
[1:07:24] and the word was god
[1:07:26] and the word was with god and the word
[1:07:29] was made flesh
[1:07:31] peter picks it up and
[1:07:32] said first peter he says and this is the
[1:07:35] word whereby the gospel is preached to
[1:07:38] you
[1:07:38] it's not are you listening if not all
[1:07:41] pastors saw it so brother swords all he
[1:07:43] preached even no it's god's word
[1:07:46] and he who god sent will speak his word
[1:07:50] gloria listen if you sit at the america
[1:07:53] center uh representative from here over
[1:07:56] to ukraine
[1:07:58] and and uh i don't care how much
[1:08:01] he want to say what he want to say
[1:08:03] he got to say what by and tell him to
[1:08:05] say
[1:08:06] or else he's not an ambassador
[1:08:08] he his own glory you got too many people
[1:08:11] their own way
[1:08:13] god sent them to spring the word they
[1:08:14] want to say what they want to say
[1:08:16] but god said he he's saying will speak
[1:08:18] his word
[1:08:19] and if he's the true genuine ambassador
[1:08:21] for the united states the man can say
[1:08:23] well look you know it'll be easy if we
[1:08:25] just do this he said but the president
[1:08:27] said this is what it is
[1:08:29] i can show you that it's a little
[1:08:31] different let me show you the ambassador
[1:08:33] said i don't care what you say president
[1:08:35] biden said this here now if you want to
[1:08:37] go along with it if you want to agree
[1:08:38] with it fine if you don't then i'm going
[1:08:40] back and taking the proposal whatever
[1:08:42] that country offered you i'm taking it
[1:08:44] back are you listening and god said if
[1:08:46] you don't want to believe the word glory
[1:08:47] then when i do i'll take it back cause
[1:08:50] the word was sent to you to profit with
[1:08:55] the only thing he did he beat the devil
[1:08:59] he gave you he gave you the only thing
[1:09:02] you can defeat the devil with
[1:09:05] he took down muscle man
[1:09:08] took down pretty women
[1:09:10] took down big churches
[1:09:13] small churches
[1:09:15] you can say all you want to say the only
[1:09:17] thing that's going to defeat him is the
[1:09:18] word
[1:09:20] glory
[1:09:23] listen
[1:09:25] and he's not afraid
[1:09:27] he challenged jesus
[1:09:29] and you think you got something
[1:09:32] he challenged jesus and what jesus would
[1:09:35] want to make sure that he defeated satan
[1:09:38] would when he went there for 40 days and
[1:09:40] 40 nights he didn't use nothing else
[1:09:43] do you know he could have said listen
[1:09:44] satan you know who i am
[1:09:46] i created you i can destroy you
[1:09:50] but he never did that
[1:09:52] he just went right along man should not
[1:09:54] live by breton i need bread i need to
[1:09:56] eat
[1:09:57] but i'm not going to let me leave me eat
[1:09:59] me
[1:10:00] ahead of what you say amen
[1:10:02] see i want to i want to i want to be
[1:10:05] successful i want to have a lot of
[1:10:06] things in life lord but he said listen i
[1:10:08] give it all to you he said but giving it
[1:10:10] to me outside the word it's not it's not
[1:10:13] going to help you
[1:10:15] so he wanted him to realize that
[1:10:17] whatever you need whatever your battles
[1:10:20] is the word reality
[1:10:23] glory
[1:10:26] little little wild he said the world
[1:10:28] won't see me but you shall see me
[1:10:30] the world cosmos the world order won't
[1:10:32] see me but you shall see me for i will
[1:10:35] be with you even in you at that day what
[1:10:39] day this day the world don't see it no
[1:10:41] more but you shall see him why because
[1:10:44] the word is in the bride
[1:10:46] you and god have become not it's united
[1:10:49] signs and times people think they've
[1:10:51] denied it with the church to hear no
[1:10:53] it's god in you heaven and earth is
[1:10:55] really want to embrace one another
[1:10:58] are you listening
[1:11:00] abraham abraham abraham looked for a
[1:11:02] city
[1:11:03] he looked for a city
[1:11:05] whose building maker was god
[1:11:07] he was looking for that city
[1:11:09] brother branstad was right above his
[1:11:11] head
[1:11:12] he knew that there was something greater
[1:11:14] he could feel it he looked for it glory
[1:11:17] and he was searching for it all his life
[1:11:19] where you going abraham and listen i
[1:11:21] just want to dramatize just for a minute
[1:11:23] abraham where you going i don't know
[1:11:24] what you mean when you don't know where
[1:11:26] you're going it's a city somewhere
[1:11:28] i'm looking for it
[1:11:30] it's not in canaan
[1:11:32] it's not in canaan it's not not not not
[1:11:35] in mesopotamia but abraham lot said well
[1:11:37] let me tell you something abraham you
[1:11:39] said there's a message to believe it i
[1:11:41] ain't gonna hang with that no more good
[1:11:43] you got a bunch of lots that's been
[1:11:44] shaken off
[1:11:46] glory
[1:11:47] in other words abraham could not get his
[1:11:49] full blessing until god got rid of a lot
[1:11:52] and a lot of people can't get their full
[1:11:54] blessing because they hold it on to
[1:11:56] about lots of lots in their life
[1:11:58] sometimes god's word calls for a total
[1:12:01] separation from all unbelief
[1:12:04] don't forget who it is
[1:12:07] it could be anybody your mama daddy
[1:12:09] whatever
[1:12:10] god's word calls for a total separation
[1:12:14] and abraham
[1:12:16] glory
[1:12:17] see we have received the kingdom our
[1:12:18] kingdom is not up this world
[1:12:20] jesus said if his kingdom was of this
[1:12:22] world you know we'll be fighting all
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:25] we'll be trying to uphold it try to
[1:12:26] fight but it's not let them fight for
[1:12:28] ukraine
[1:12:30] let them fight for russia let them fight
[1:12:32] for the united states do you realize
[1:12:34] what's happening now all the prophecies
[1:12:36] that brother branham said you are living
[1:12:38] in that
[1:12:40] you are living in what was smoking
[1:12:43] but in 1933 those visions only thing you
[1:12:46] waiting on is the bomb to drop
[1:12:50] now let me let me just say this here
[1:12:51] good and the reason why i didn't drop
[1:12:54] because brother branham says before one
[1:12:57] bomb dropped
[1:12:59] the bride
[1:13:00] will be
[1:13:02] gone hallelujah and
[1:13:05] we
[1:13:06] we are resting on that
[1:13:10] we are resting on that
[1:13:13] listen
[1:13:16] i had a friend out in fetus arizona
[1:13:19] he got in that car
[1:13:21] they sent the car to his house no nobody
[1:13:24] was in it
[1:13:26] come pick him up
[1:13:27] call his name
[1:13:29] know where he lived at
[1:13:31] he got in the car and it took him where
[1:13:32] he wanted to go
[1:13:34] and he could have played games he said
[1:13:36] if he wants to
[1:13:38] search is this the time
[1:13:41] lord
[1:13:42] he realized that the vision that the
[1:13:45] prophecy we just look at because we're
[1:13:47] in the technology
[1:13:49] you know we get this computer this car
[1:13:51] here but listen brother branham went
[1:13:53] down
[1:13:55] he had to come all the way up here
[1:13:58] to see what was going on
[1:14:00] he was not he was not are you listening
[1:14:03] lord he didn't know about going all the
[1:14:04] chains of events that's unfolding
[1:14:07] glory
[1:14:08] and we thought about the car
[1:14:11] a few years ago we were excited about
[1:14:13] riding down the street watching our what
[1:14:15] you call it the monitor video with the
[1:14:17] tv
[1:14:19] riding down the street having tv monitor
[1:14:21] yeah dvd
[1:14:22] watching tv praise god
[1:14:24] but that's not what he said
[1:14:26] he said they'll be going down the road
[1:14:28] playing games with no sterny wheels no
[1:14:31] nothing
[1:14:32] it's this day
[1:14:33] that scripture
[1:14:35] that prophecy has been fulfilled in your
[1:14:39] ears
[1:14:40] what what made the people really know
[1:14:43] what made them really know glory when
[1:14:45] jesus read that scripture this day the
[1:14:47] scriptures were filled he went back
[1:14:50] when he went back and saw what the
[1:14:52] prophet said said
[1:14:53] and then after he said he looked around
[1:14:55] he said wait a minute this is not just
[1:14:57] something just happened
[1:14:59] somebody has spoken this before gloria
[1:15:02] are you listening
[1:15:03] and he says
[1:15:05] he talked quote in isaiah the blinded
[1:15:07] eyes was open the deaf ears are and all
[1:15:09] these things and jesus
[1:15:10] he realized he fulfilling it i'm the one
[1:15:13] doing this here
[1:15:14] i'm the one fulfilling it sometimes
[1:15:17] people sit in message churches all day
[1:15:19] like and don't realize they are the ones
[1:15:21] that fulfilling the words
[1:15:23] the word is in the bride

[1:15:27] message this is your time this is the
[1:15:30] time going

[1:15:33] to sit home and hope it all that's going
[1:15:36] wrong i don't know if i'm gonna go to
[1:15:37] church all the coronavirus just happened
[1:15:40] to go
[1:15:41] let everything come like it was but one
[1:15:43] thing lord we have received a kingdom
[1:15:46] which can not be moved
[1:15:49] i don't care what they do what goes on
[1:15:52] in the earth it's not going to trade god
[1:15:56] god never changes mind about his word
[1:16:00] glory
[1:16:01] can't do it
[1:16:03] and they looked
[1:16:05] and jesus
[1:16:07] he said this day
[1:16:09] isaiah
[1:16:11] 61 i used to know it in my head it's
[1:16:13] being fulfilled in your ears
[1:16:15] hey listen
[1:16:17] we should be able to look back
[1:16:20] and look at what's going on
[1:16:22] and all the prophecies was taking place
[1:16:26] you know brother bradley mentioned if
[1:16:27] you've read it in church you could take
[1:16:29] a a sale out of a cow let's say if you
[1:16:32] take it out a kidney after a cow you put
[1:16:35] it in a human being
[1:16:37] guess what
[1:16:38] it's gonna go right where the kidneys
[1:16:40] supposed to be
[1:16:41] it may not work in you but it's got
[1:16:43] enough sense to know listen i come from
[1:16:46] a kidney
[1:16:47] glory if you take a brain cell and take
[1:16:50] it and inject it in your leg it's going
[1:16:52] to go to the brain
[1:16:54] you know why because there's a law
[1:16:56] going that god had no cells there and
[1:16:59] brother branham realized that he wasn't

[1:49:21] my flesh and drink my blood

[1:49:38] to
[1:49:40] the national
[1:49:41] who is he
[1:49:43] but see they were failing to see that
[1:49:45] his ministry was moving into the channel
[1:49:48] in which god was getting ready he now
[1:49:50] was a messiah he was a manifested word
[1:49:53] of that day

[1:54:45] i was preaching the other night
[1:54:48] the other night

[1:54:52] we always put on balaam
[1:54:55] you know with balaam donkey
[1:54:57] you know
[1:54:59] preacher we always put on women preach
[1:55:00] because they said god can use anybody
[1:55:04] so if you want to lay yourself to that
[1:55:06] that's fine
[1:55:09] but
[1:55:10] but see even that's awful amen
[1:55:12] because the duck is spoke with a not a
[1:55:14] woman's voice
[1:55:17] he spoke with a man
[1:55:19] so that means
[1:55:20] it was a male donkey
[1:55:23] so that cuts her out again
[1:55:28] [Applause]
[1:55:29] but what but what i want to bring
[1:55:34] god
[1:55:36] balaam he said he did that the full bear
[1:55:38] the madness of the prophet
[1:55:40] so when balaam got sold you know
[1:55:42] he got so in the money
[1:55:44] balance ain't gonna make him big make it
[1:55:46] so god could deal with it
[1:55:49] so god come down and he had balaam's own
[1:55:52] donkey
[1:55:55] and he took that dunk and god said
[1:55:57] you know he won't listen
[1:55:59] and the dunk could ride and the only
[1:56:01] thing he had in his mind i'll let church
[1:56:02] say amen i'm gonna get home sometimes
[1:56:04] people have something in their mind so
[1:56:06] bad that they want to do they overlook
[1:56:08] god's word they overlook what's right
[1:56:10] they just look at it they don't care
[1:56:12] what it is and sometimes
[1:56:14] god has to come down and do something to
[1:56:16] stop them
[1:56:17] [Applause]
[1:56:23] and balaam
[1:56:25] he got there
[1:56:27] got on that donkey only thing he was
[1:56:29] thinking about hey i'm gonna be
[1:56:31] you know they made me the board of
[1:56:32] bishops now
[1:56:33] i'm the greatest man i'm going you know
[1:56:35] that's what he think in his mind
[1:56:36] whatever he was thinking he got on the
[1:56:38] dunk and he started riding god said i
[1:56:40] can't speak to him he won't listen to me
[1:56:44] praise the lord
[1:56:45] i'd have tried everything to stop him
[1:56:49] well listen so as he was driving down he
[1:56:51] had a good donkey
[1:56:53] when he needed him to plow the ducky
[1:56:55] plow he needed to do this the donkey
[1:56:56] just was so kind
[1:56:58] wouldn't argue with us
[1:57:01] and when he got on the start riding
[1:57:02] going down the bay league
[1:57:04] god anointed the donkey
[1:57:07] and as he was getting ready to go
[1:57:09] the dunkin seen the supernatural baleam
[1:57:11] got there it was two walls on this side
[1:57:13] two mountains in the in the dunking
[1:57:15] baylor he had to go through that little
[1:57:17] thing
[1:57:18] walk walk way through that mountain
[1:57:21] and the donkey saw that angel had to
[1:57:22] swore drawed
[1:57:24] and the dog said look you may be crazy
[1:57:26] enough to go this way
[1:57:28] but uh uh i ain't going that way
[1:57:31] and that angel had that sword drawn
[1:57:34] and he got it and said
[1:57:36] oh god and the doctor would have brushed
[1:57:38] his head foot against him against the um
[1:57:40] the mountain and he got come on don't go
[1:57:43] bust your foot on that side and then all
[1:57:46] of a sudden babe said what's wrong with
[1:57:48] this meal he took him in obviously he
[1:57:49] had a cane took his cane and whipped him
[1:57:52] whipped it
[1:57:53] hit the doctor with her and the doctor
[1:57:55] started speaking in tongues
[1:57:58] [Applause]
[1:58:00] he says have i ever disobeyed you
[1:58:04] have i ever acted like this never have i
[1:58:07] ever done anything wrong to you
[1:58:09] man i'm saying no no but you keeping me
[1:58:12] for my money
[1:58:14] no no and all of a sudden when the
[1:58:16] donkey starts speaking in tongues the
[1:58:18] bible says smoke with a man's voice
[1:58:21] and that was the only thing that brought
[1:58:23] balaam to his senses
[1:58:25] sometimes people get so spiritual poor
[1:58:27] blind rich and naked and don't even know
[1:58:29] it and it's hard for god to speak to him
[1:58:32] repent oh age here the series of the
