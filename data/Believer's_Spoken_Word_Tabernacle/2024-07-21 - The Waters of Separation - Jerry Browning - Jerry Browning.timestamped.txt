[31:32] you're a good group of people to preach
[31:33] to and you you uh uh you really help the
[31:37] preacher out uh I've
[31:41] uh uh back years ago when I actually was
[31:44] doing some traveling I had actually been
[31:47] in some places where uh I had to preach
[31:49] an amen myself and uh I remember one
[31:54] particular church I went to a group that
[31:57] that particular morning we had two
[31:59] services but on Sunday morning uh I was
[32:02] about maybe 10 minutes into preaching
[32:04] and I started praying to myself Lord
[32:06] help me get through this and uh I I felt
[32:10] like I was like just plowing uphill the
[32:13] whole way and uh so uh we went with the
[32:19] the pastor that day and then I came back
[32:22] that night to preach and and I was
[32:24] saying Lord what what would you have me
[32:25] preach and so the Lord laid on my heart
[32:28] just a little very simple
[32:30] Evangelistic uh type message about when
[32:33] David was anointed king all the hosts of
[32:36] the Philistines came against him and so
[32:38] I just preached that little message and
[32:40] and dealt with just personal kind of
[32:42] testimony type things of how the devil
[32:44] fights you and that and that and that
[32:46] place came alive it was like a different
[32:49] group you know but uh but I always enjoy
[32:51] preaching here you know I and it's very
[32:55] easy and uh so
[32:58] uh it's always a treat and I just uh I'd
[33:01] start mentioning you all by name but it
[33:03] would take up so much time and I
[33:05] wouldn't want to leave anybody out but
[33:07] uh you know there's I was thinking this
[33:09] morning there's some of you here that uh
[33:12] that I feel like I I've knowing some of

[34:44] Chapter 19 and uh this is actually a
[34:47] subject I preached on recently at home

[34:53] from what I had preached on and and just
[34:55] felt to to

[35:01] separation and uh so I I pray that uh
[35:06] the Lord will just lead us and we'll
[35:08] just be able to reach everybody with it
[35:11] amen Numbers Chapter 19 uh we'll read
[35:14] from verses one down to verse
[35:17] 10 and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[35:19] unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance
[35:22] of the law which the Lord hath commanded
[35:24] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[35:27] that they bring thee a red heer without
[35:29] spot wherein is no blemish and upon
[35:32] which never came a yoke and ye sht give
[35:35] her unto Eleazar the priest and that he
[35:39] may bring her forth without the camp and
[35:41] one shall slay her before his face and
[35:44] elazar the priest shall take her blood
[35:47] with his finger and sprinkle of her
[35:49] blood directly before the Tabernacle of
[35:51] the congregation seven times and one
[35:54] shall burn the heer in his sight her
[35:56] skin and her fles flesh and her blood
[35:58] with her dung shall he burn and the
[36:01] priest shall take cedar wood and hisp
[36:04] and Scarlet and cast it in the midst of
[36:06] the burning of the hepher then the
[36:08] priest shall wash his clothes and he
[36:10] shall bathe his flesh in water and
[36:12] afterward he shall come into the camp
[36:14] and the priest shall be unclean until
[36:16] even and he that burneth her shall wash
[36:19] his clothes in the water and bathe this
[36:21] flesh in the water and shall be unclean
[36:24] until the evening and a man that is
[36:27] clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the
[36:29] heph and lay them up without the camp in
[36:32] a clean place and it shall be kept for
[36:34] the congregation of the children of
[36:35] Israel for a water of Separation it is a
[36:38] purification for sin and he that
[36:40] gathereth the ashes of the heer shall
[36:42] wash his clothes and be clean and
[36:45] unclean until the evening and shall be
[36:47] unto the children of Israel uh and unto
[36:50] the stranger that sojourn with them for
[36:52] a statue forever amen you may be seated
[36:58] we know that sin entered in to God's
[37:01] creation in the garden uh when uh man
[37:06] disobeyed God's word and uh and he
[37:10] disobeyed God's word because of
[37:13] unbelief and so there was then a a a
[37:19] necessity because uh the Bible tells us
[37:22] man uh there had to they had to be drove
[37:25] from the garden and there was an angel
[37:28] that was placed there to keep the way to
[37:31] the Tree of Life uh to so that man could
[37:34] not come back and partake of the tree of
[37:37] life because he had sinned and because
[37:40] of the sin H uh you know death entered
[37:44] in and so uh then uh there so then God
[37:51] comes and he he gives a promise so that
[37:56] man can have a way to actually be free
[37:59] from the sin and be able to at one day
[38:03] be able to return back to the tree of
[38:05] life and This Promise he made was that
[38:09] he said I'll put enity but to the woman
[38:11] he said I'll put enity but uh to the
[38:14] serpent he said I'll put enity between
[38:16] thy seed and the seed of the woman and
[38:19] he said and he shall uh you shall bruise
[38:22] his heel but he shall bruise your head
[38:25] so it was a promise actually of
[38:27] Redemption that God made there in the
[38:30] garden and so then uh there had to be uh
[38:34] a death uh that and so God slayed a lamb
[38:39] and he took the the the skins from the
[38:42] lamb and clothed his children and so
[38:45] then there so then there was a there had
[38:48] to be something for man uh brother
[38:51] brandham says that God gave him
[38:53] temporarily until that promise could be
[38:57] ful fulfi and so he uh brought a
[39:01] temporary perpetuation for their sin and
[39:06] until that the woman's seed could bruise
[39:10] the head of the serpent and pay the full
[39:13] penalty of sin and and so here we find
[39:19] that uh that God then here in the time
[39:23] of Moses he brings them this uh it's a
[39:26] purific for sin it was a temporary uh
[39:30] thing that was a shadow of the coming of
[39:33] the promise which was a promise of a
[39:36] messiah a a redeemer to come and redeem
[39:40] man and and and so they they would take
[39:43] this hepher and and they would slay the
[39:46] heer and they would burn every bit of
[39:50] the heer and and that and then once it
[39:53] was burned and reduced to Ash they would
[39:56] take the ash from this and they would
[39:59] mix it with water and then that was
[40:02] called then the water of separation and
[40:05] you you see here in the scripture that
[40:07] it's talking about the the priests
[40:10] washing themselves and washing their
[40:12] clothes in this water of Separation you
[40:15] know and you wonder what uh how could
[40:17] this this symbology of this be with
[40:20] being Ash in water well if you look back
[40:23] you find out that's what man first made
[40:25] soap out of was was Ash and so here God
[40:30] says wash yourself in this and so but
[40:34] not only were the priests to wash
[40:35] themselves and wash their clothes but
[40:37] the people were to come and be washed in
[40:40] this water of separation and and and
[40:43] this heer was offered uh once a year for
[40:47] the sins of the people and the people
[40:50] would come then and if they had sinned
[40:52] then they would be washed in this water
[40:55] and it was called a water of Separation
[40:57] it's separated them from the guilt of
[41:00] their sins Hallelujah and and actually
[41:04] would bring them back into a uh to a
[41:08] being holy before Jehovah to where they
[41:12] could come into the Tabernacle and come
[41:15] into fellowship with God and so but this
[41:19] was actually just uh as brother R said a
[41:22] temporary thing that God established
[41:26] until the promise could be fulfilled and
[41:29] so then you you know it was it was
[41:31] called the things in the old test called
[41:33] shadows and types this so this was the
[41:37] the the slaying of this red heer and the
[41:39] making of this water of Separation was
[41:42] actually a shadow of what God was
[41:44] actually pointing to what what was going
[41:46] to be when that promise was fulfilled
[41:49] when Christ was born and and so then you
[41:53] think about your Shadow uh you know if
[41:56] you're standing in light is casting
[41:59] across you and it and it cast and and
[42:01] you see a shadow as you walk toward uh
[42:05] that the light then eventually the
[42:08] shadow disappears and the Shadow's gone
[42:11] and what's there is actually the reality
[42:15] and that's the way it was with the
[42:16] promise of God there was a shadow of
[42:20] what God was going to do that what they
[42:22] were keeping here with the slay of the
[42:24] red heer but when Christ was born this
[42:27] the the the the reality of the promise
[42:30] came into view and the shadow was no
[42:34] more and that's why that Jesus said I
[42:36] didn't come to do away with the law but
[42:38] I came to fulfill the law see the law
[42:42] was actually uh pointing to what was
[42:45] going to come when the ultimate
[42:47] sacrifice Christ came and actually then
[42:51] law uh at at Calvary law metant Grace
[42:57] Hallelujah and then the law was
[43:00] fulfilled and we had
[43:04] Grace that's why we don't keep the law
[43:07] now we don't slay a red heer
[43:09] because Christ fulfilled that that was
[43:14] just a shadow pointing to his coming
[43:16] when he came and died that brought a
[43:18] fulfillment of what the law was a shadow
[43:23] of so it did away with the shadow now
[43:26] the now they had reality see when they
[43:30] would slay the red he the thing about it
[43:32] was it didn't remove the desire of Sin
[43:35] from
[43:36] man so that's why there was uh uh they
[43:40] had to constantly every year bring and
[43:43] make this
[43:45] sacrifice the Bible tells us that that
[43:48] once Christ came as a sacrifice it was a
[43:51] sacrifice once and for all and there's
[43:53] no more need of another sacrifice
[43:59] Hallelujah but it but here in the Old
[44:02] Testament it separated man from his
[44:05] guilt right and and so turn with me in
[44:09] Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll read
[44:11] verses 25 through 27
[44:15] there
[44:17] the when Christ came then his blood he
[44:20] shed his blood his blood dropped on the
[44:23] ground and it was for the blood was for
[44:26] a PF
[44:27] ification and it and it and it it was
[44:30] for a purification of the world we know
[44:33] that the world we're living in still is
[44:35] not in that purified state but the price
[44:39] for that has already been
[44:43] paid that's how we know that that when
[44:46] the scripture talks about there's going
[44:48] to be a Rapture when the scripture
[44:50] speaks of uh you know of course the
[44:52] scripture doesn't use the word rapture
[44:54] it uses you know we'll be caught up
[44:56] together and and things but uh when it
[44:58] when it speaks of the coming of a A New
[45:01] Earth the time of the Millennium and
[45:03] then the coming of a new Earth and a new
[45:04] Heaven and these things we know that all
[45:07] that is is going to happen because we
[45:09] see the price for it the penalty of sin
[45:13] has been met and
[45:16] paid so now look here in verse 25 of
[45:19] Ephesians 5 husbands love your wives
[45:22] even as Christ also loved the church and
[45:24] gave himself for it that he might sink
[45:27] ify and cleanse it with the washing of
[45:29] Water by the word that he might present
[45:31] it to himself a glorious church not
[45:34] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[45:37] but it should be holy and without
[45:40] blemish now what we've covered so far uh
[45:45] you know it uh it has a a lot of
[45:49] significance for someone coming to be
[45:52] forgiven of their sin and accept Jesus
[45:54] Christ as their savior
[46:00] but it but this the the application of
[46:04] it doesn't stop with the believer
[46:07] there we constantly apply it to our
[46:12] lives and uh you know the thing that I
[46:17] find with with many Believers is you
[46:20] know we we realize every day we live
[46:24] with the accuser of the brethren Satan
[46:27] the accuser of the brother and he's
[46:30] there he's always coming against you
[46:33] yeah and as brother random said in the
[46:35] greatest battle ever fought said he
[46:36] chose his Battleground he chose the mind
[46:39] so Satan is constantly attacking you and
[46:42] he attacks the believer you know and and
[46:45] and and I know there at one time I had
[46:47] heard from different people thought well
[46:49] when I get the Holy Ghost or when this
[46:50] happens and I won't have that anymore I
[46:52] won't have that that's that's not what
[46:54] it is because brother brandom said look
[46:57] he said uh the the promise in in in the
[47:00] Bible is to the Overcomer and he say so
[47:04] God's not going to take you he says and
[47:06] pull you up through a pipe and bring you
[47:09] out the other end and say blessed is the
[47:11] Overcomer he you give you've not
[47:13] overcome anything he say so you're going
[47:15] to have to have things to overcome and
[47:18] one of the things we got to overcome is
[47:20] in this battle of the mind that Satan
[47:23] continuously wages against the believer
[47:26] and there Ison he brings this is to try
[47:28] to bring doubt to you and and friends
[47:31] look you you you say well I never have a
[47:33] doubt about about this message being the
[47:36] truth I don't have a doubt about God I
[47:38] don't have a but you know what he brings
[47:39] the doubt on the doubt is about
[47:42] you he tries to get you to doubt your
[47:45] righteousness doubt whether you're holy
[47:48] doubt whether you're going to make the
[47:50] Rapture you know how many could raise
[47:51] their hand and say at some time the
[47:53] devil said you're not going to make this
[47:55] Rapture oh yeah oh yeah
[48:00] right I remember several several years
[48:03] ago uh before we ever had this building
[48:06] brother Dan daisley had come up and he
[48:09] was giving a testimony and he said he
[48:10] was out one time traveling with his
[48:13] brother Henry green was his Pastor back
[48:15] then he said we were out going somewhere
[48:17] together he says and we we stopped at a
[48:19] gas station and he said uh I I I went to
[48:21] go use the restroom he said I come out
[48:23] and I couldn't find brother Henry
[48:25] anywhere he said and I was looking for
[48:27] him he said and and all of a sudden he
[48:29] said a thought ran through my head the
[48:31] raptures took place and you missed it
[48:33] that's why you can't find brother Henry
[48:36] and he said at first that thought just
[48:38] kind of like brought a fear he said then
[48:40] he said devil you're a liar because if
[48:43] the Rapture took place I wouldn't be
[48:45] here either you know now he didn't say
[48:49] that because of some fleshly works or
[48:52] his uh uh his confidence in his own self
[48:56] but because of his confidence in the
[48:58] power of Jesus Christ in his
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:02] life so we've all had that where the
[49:06] devil will say you know you're going to
[49:08] miss it you know you're not going to
[49:10] make it and he constantly points out
[49:12] anytime you make a mistake I'll tell you
[49:14] something the devil's going to be right
[49:16] there to point out your mistake to you
[49:18] and and the thing you realize is you
[49:20] know and and he'll try to make you think
[49:22] you're thinking of this or God's making
[49:24] you feel this way and that but I'm going
[49:25] to tell you something for friends God
[49:28] never makes his Believers feel
[49:31] condemned but Satan does that Satan
[49:35] brings
[49:36] condemnation Satan's the one that makes
[49:39] you feel like I'm not I'm not good
[49:42] enough I I'm not righteous look what
[49:44] I've done I've made this mistake I I've
[49:46] messed up I've sinned I've done this and
[49:48] now I'm not worthy it's Satan that does
[49:51] that amen when when God deals with us
[49:53] when we're s God actually deals with us
[49:56] to move to get right make it
[50:01] right
[50:04] Hallelujah so the washing of Water by
[50:08] the word so it's the word that washes us
[50:14] now because Jesus Christ we find the
[50:18] Bible says in the beginning was the word
[50:21] and the Word was made flesh and came
[50:23] Among Us and dwelt among us and so the
[50:27] word made flesh in Christ and then
[50:29] Christ died that sacrifice and then the
[50:33] the water of separation for us is
[50:36] actually the word of
[50:39] God hallelujah and so we brother Bram
[50:42] then he points talking uh when brother
[50:45] brandham was preaching about the Waters
[50:46] of Separation he brings it back to
[50:48] Ephesians 5 here and he says that
[50:51] washing of Water by the word that is the
[50:54] water of Separation to the believer
[50:56] today
[50:57] and he says what is that he says it's
[50:59] the preaching of the word that when the
[51:02] word is preached he says it actually
[51:06] identifies for us our condition it will
[51:10] the word will point out if if there's
[51:13] anywhere that we need to make a
[51:16] correction the word will Point friends
[51:19] look there are times that you can do
[51:21] something that make a mistake sin and
[51:25] and you don't even realize done
[51:29] it I'll show it right remember brother
[51:33] brandom when the IRS was just really
[51:36] hounding
[51:37] him and brother bam later gives a
[51:40] testimony how they he was under such
[51:42] pressure with it that when the IRS man
[51:45] the one day called to the house he was
[51:47] under such pressure he told his wife
[51:49] sister Min he said he went to step out
[51:50] the door and says tell them I'm not
[51:53] here and and so he went on out then
[51:55] brother brand
[51:57] went on about his life like everything
[51:58] was fine and then he gets a call some
[52:02] child is sick and needs prayer and
[52:04] brother brandom goes to go pray for the
[52:06] child and then the Lord speaks to him
[52:10] and says points him back to that lie he
[52:13] told brother Brandon wasn't even he
[52:15] didn't even think anything about it but
[52:17] God brought it to his
[52:19] attention and then brother Brenham then
[52:22] he goes then and he calls up the IRS man
[52:25] he confesses what he he did you know and
[52:27] he and he and he clears that up and
[52:29] makes it right then goes and prays for
[52:31] the child and the child is
[52:33] healed so there's times we can do it but
[52:36] then the there's times we're sitting in
[52:38] in in church and the Lord through the
[52:41] preaching will bring something out and
[52:43] point something out and say oh my
[52:44] goodness I didn't even realize I did
[52:46] that but he's not bringing it to your
[52:48] attention to bring condemnation to you
[52:51] but he's bringing it to your attention
[52:52] because he is the perpetuation for your
[52:55] sin is a sacrifice for your sin and he
[52:59] not only provided a perpetuation but he
[53:02] provided a way of access to you to that
[53:05] perpetuation by saying if any man say
[53:08] they haven't sinned he he's a liar and
[53:11] the truth's not in him so John said
[53:14] we've all sinned you know but it says
[53:17] but if we confess our sin he is faithful
[53:20] and just to forgive us and cleanse us
[53:24] from all unrighteousness amen amen
[53:28] hallelujah praise
[53:31] God and so there there is and it says
[53:34] he's a perpetuation for our sin he is
[53:37] our Advocate with the father
[53:43] right so brother bam says if if he he
[53:46] says in the message of water of
[53:47] Separation he says you know look that he
[53:50] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[53:52] washing of Water by the word he says if
[53:54] you've got a sin apply by the word it's
[53:58] the water of separation and it'll
[54:00] separate you from your
[54:03] guilt Hallelujah and it brings you it
[54:06] was a way to bring you back into
[54:09] [Music]
[54:11] Fellowship I've uh at times I've had
[54:15] people you know you're counseling with
[54:17] and and and you know maybe some things
[54:19] happen in in their life and and some
[54:22] things that are uh actually uh uh you
[54:25] know making C requirements out of them
[54:27] in this life and and maybe they'll miss
[54:31] a couple of services or
[54:33] so and and at first they think it's fine
[54:37] but then after they're out of church for
[54:39] a couple of services you know then all
[54:41] of a sudden they start feeling like I'm
[54:42] so far from
[54:45] God of course Satan's there to attack
[54:47] and say well then you might as well just
[54:48] quit and give up see but what that
[54:51] actually means friends look it is
[54:53] important to stay in fellowship with God
[54:55] that's right it's important to to have a
[54:58] prayer life it's important to listen to
[55:00] the message it's important to read your
[55:03] Bible and it is important to forsake not
[55:06] this semon of yourselves together even
[55:08] so much more as you see the day
[55:10] approaching that's right you know we we
[55:13] draw from fellowship from one another
[55:15] when we come and we assemble here we
[55:17] draw strength from one another maybe
[55:19] it's not from somebody directly saying
[55:22] something uh to you and that but when
[55:24] the all the Believers come together
[55:26] begin to worship maybe you're really
[55:28] going through something maybe that in
[55:30] your human feelings and that you think I
[55:32] don't really feel like singing But you
[55:34] get in there and then you get surrounded
[55:36] by your other brothers and sisters that
[55:38] maybe at that time they're up and so
[55:41] then that encouragement comes and then
[55:43] you're together you draw strength from
[55:45] one another and then there's the
[55:47] preaching of the
[55:48] word that God has provided away Faith
[55:53] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[55:55] word but how can we hear the Bible says
[55:59] andless there be a
[56:01] preacher so God works through the fful
[56:04] ministry to minister to his people to
[56:08] bring the word to free you from your
[56:14] [Music]
[56:15] guilt because Satan attacks us to try to
[56:18] discourage
[56:23] us but then the word comes and says
[56:26] brother B says look he says one of the
[56:28] things that's our problem is is you
[56:30] don't know who you
[56:33] are you don't know who you are he said I
[56:36] dealt with so many people he says I
[56:37] realize it's the truth he said they you
[56:40] don't realize who you are you are the
[56:42] Bride of Jesus
[56:45] Christ look we're not depending on our
[56:48] works we're not depending on have I been
[56:51] good for 30 days we're not dependent on
[56:54] have I you know when was the last time I
[56:56] met made a mistake or when was the last
[56:58] time I Sinn that that's not what our
[57:00] righteousness is depending on our
[57:02] righteousness is not depending on
[57:03] something that God needs to do for us
[57:06] our righteousness is depending on it's
[57:09] already been done the price has already
[57:12] been paid the ultimate sacrifice has
[57:15] been made
[57:17] Hallelujah you don't have to come and
[57:19] get saved again all you got to do is
[57:22] confess your sin and he forgives you
[57:25] amen
[57:27] hallelujah
[57:29] hallelujah
[57:33] hallelujah
[57:35] hallelujah so the the word comes and the
[57:39] word's preached how many times have you
[57:41] sat in service you know and heard uh uh
[57:44] your pastor or a visiting minister or
[57:47] some someone preaching and and you and
[57:50] you think my goodness the things they're
[57:52] saying me and my wife or or something we
[57:55] just talked about this we just had this
[57:58] conversation how did they know about it
[58:00] they didn't but there is one that knows
[58:04] all and this is the very the most
[58:07] important thing you know a lot of people
[58:08] say you know there's allseeing eye you
[58:11] know God knows everything God knows what
[58:13] you do or whatever but look from friends
[58:15] I'm going to tell you something God's
[58:16] not Santa Claus you know that old saying
[58:19] about you know about Santa you know he
[58:21] knows whether you're sleeping he knows
[58:22] when you're awake he knows whether
[58:24] you've been bad or good for so Be Good
[58:26] For Heaven's Sake and if you're not good
[58:28] you don't get a gift you get a piece of
[58:31] coal that's not God no Christ paid the
[58:37] price and God God made the promise back
[58:41] in the in the garden in the days of Adam
[58:44] and Eve that he was going to provide a
[58:46] way back for
[58:49] mankind and it wasn't based on whatever
[58:53] man could do because God knew man
[58:56] couldn't keep the Covenant that's right
[58:59] so God made an unconditional Covenant
[59:02] it's not if you do this I'll do that but
[59:05] I have already done it all you need to
[59:08] do is just accept
[59:10] it Hallelujah so just as the water of
[59:14] Separation separates the sinner from his
[59:18] sin the water of Separation it separates
[59:22] the Born Again Believer from the guilt
[59:25] that Satan tries to bring on them and
[59:28] condemn them and make you doubt
[59:33] yourself
[59:35] that's realize Satan when he does that
[59:38] he's always pointing at
[59:41] you want you to look at yourself this is
[59:44] the thing we're not to look at ourselves
[59:46] we're to look at our
[59:49] sacrifice
[59:52] Hallelujah and then the the preaching of
[59:54] the word god comes and friends look I've
[59:58] had people you know come out of services
[1:00:00] and and brother brandham gives I think
[1:00:03] actually Billy Paul gives a testimony
[1:00:04] one time and hearing somebody come two
[1:00:07] people coming out of brother brandom
[1:00:08] service and and one said tell you what
[1:00:10] when I was there he called me a buzzard
[1:00:13] and and and and the other man said
[1:00:14] that's funny he called me an eagle so
[1:00:17] you know what are you you know what are
[1:00:19] you getting out of it and I've had
[1:00:21] people you know that come to church and
[1:00:23] maybe God will bring a message that
[1:00:25] that's actually a message of Correction
[1:00:27] but you realize if God's bringing a
[1:00:28] message of Correction to you it's
[1:00:30] because you're his
[1:00:35] child why isn't God correcting the world
[1:00:38] out there because they don't belong to
[1:00:40] him that's right if there's anyone out
[1:00:42] there in the world that belongs to him
[1:00:44] he will bring correction and he'll bring
[1:00:46] them in under the word to be washed by
[1:00:48] the word
[1:00:56] David said you know he he he looked and
[1:00:59] said consider the blessings of the
[1:01:01] wicked but the Lord said to him consider
[1:01:03] their
[1:01:06] end well let's just take and flip that
[1:01:09] consider your
[1:01:11] end what is your end I don't have an
[1:01:16] endall you know what we've got facing us
[1:01:18] as Believers we've got a new
[1:01:21] beginning we have we we we have a new
[1:01:24] life and one day that new life that's
[1:01:27] came on the inside of us by the
[1:01:29] separation from the things of the word
[1:01:32] uh World by the word of Christ one day
[1:01:35] what's happened on the inside this
[1:01:37] outside will eventually come and it'll
[1:01:40] match that
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:43] hallelujah
[1:01:47] hallelujah why do we continuously need
[1:01:49] this washing of the Water by the word
[1:01:51] after we've come and give our lives to
[1:01:53] Christ accepting as a savior been born
[1:01:55] again filled with the Holy
[1:01:59] Ghost remember when Paul speaks in in
[1:02:02] Ephesians 4 and Paul talks about that
[1:02:04] after you've been sealed by the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost he says put off from you all envy
[1:02:09] and all malice and and all these things
[1:02:11] so Paul says look you're still going to
[1:02:13] be contending with this flesh after
[1:02:15] you're sealed by the Holy Ghost because
[1:02:18] it's not this flesh that's sealed by the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost it's your soul it's that real
[1:02:23] you that is that that new life
[1:02:26] you know look friends it was there all
[1:02:28] along some people try to say well the
[1:02:31] preacher put that there or the prophet
[1:02:33] put that there no they didn't you came
[1:02:35] here that way brother renom said in in
[1:02:38] in the the one message he says somewhere
[1:02:40] in the back part of God's mind you were
[1:02:43] a thought of God before the world was
[1:02:46] even
[1:02:47] formed so God had you in his thoughts
[1:02:51] you were you came into this world I
[1:02:53] don't care what you were born in I don't
[1:02:55] care whether you were religious or or a
[1:02:57] a non-religious person you were born
[1:03:00] with that seed of God in you and that
[1:03:03] seed of God friends what that was that
[1:03:06] was the real you hallah but until that
[1:03:10] was quickened by the word and came to
[1:03:12] life you were dealing with this old
[1:03:14] worldly nature that you were born into
[1:03:16] his brother and him said because of of
[1:03:19] the sin in the garden he said you
[1:03:22] bypassed your theophany when you came
[1:03:24] into this life
[1:03:28] oh but when you heard the word of
[1:03:31] God said and you you recognized it to be
[1:03:34] truth he said then you heard from that
[1:03:37] theop hallu
[1:03:39] hallelujah praise God realizing who you
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:46] are hallelujah amen
[1:03:49] hallelujah I'm I'm you know the devil
[1:03:52] continuously he comes and tries to
[1:03:54] remind you remember remember this thing
[1:03:56] You' done in your past remember that
[1:03:58] thing You' done in your past and you
[1:03:59] think well I've got beyond all that but
[1:04:01] then maybe you're washing dishes or or
[1:04:04] washing the car or mowing the lawn or or
[1:04:06] on the job or whatever you're doing and
[1:04:09] all of a sudden a thought will go
[1:04:10] through your head and it'll be a
[1:04:12] remembrance of of some sin or something
[1:04:15] you did before you gave your life to the
[1:04:17] Lord and then before you know it your
[1:04:19] mind gets to dwelling on that and then
[1:04:21] you start feeling so bad about it even
[1:04:24] though you you know you've already been
[1:04:27] asked asked forgiveness from that and
[1:04:29] God's already came and cleanse you from
[1:04:31] it but you begin to feel so tore up
[1:04:33] about
[1:04:35] it have you ever woke up from a dream
[1:04:37] where you were dreaming about things
[1:04:39] that you had done before you gave your
[1:04:40] life to the Lord and you wake up and you
[1:04:42] feel
[1:04:45] terrified right that's because we still
[1:04:48] got this human memory and those things
[1:04:50] are are there and and some of the things
[1:04:53] are like scars in our memory
[1:04:56] and Satan comes to continuously remind
[1:04:59] you of those
[1:05:04] things but friends look one
[1:05:07] day that memory is going to be
[1:05:11] changed and we're not going to have a
[1:05:14] memory of those things anymore because
[1:05:16] we're going to be in a theophany in a
[1:05:19] glorified body that matches this this
[1:05:22] change that's happened down in our heart
[1:05:24] amen and then we're going to be there a
[1:05:27] Triune being in in in in in in in a
[1:05:31] being that never did those
[1:05:34] things so how could you have any memory
[1:05:37] of it you didn't do it brother said
[1:05:39] we're Justified we never did it in the
[1:05:42] first
[1:05:43] place but see sometimes we have trouble
[1:05:46] accepting that right now because we are
[1:05:50] in this
[1:05:52] flesh this flesh still feels Temptation
[1:05:55] This flesh still makes
[1:05:57] mistakes brother Ram said my worst enemy
[1:06:00] he said is William
[1:06:02] Bram talking about his flesh that's our
[1:06:05] worst enemy he said it's our
[1:06:08] flesh
[1:06:11] Hallelujah but look Friends when the
[1:06:14] word is applied to your life then
[1:06:18] everything that Christ died for every
[1:06:21] promise is yours brother Ram says as
[1:06:23] freely as the water flow
[1:06:26] am
[1:06:28] hallelujah praise
[1:06:32] God brother an preached a message a
[1:06:34] handwriting on the wall I'm sure you're
[1:06:35] familiar with that message brother R was
[1:06:37] talking
[1:06:38] about how there in in that Kingdom uh
[1:06:42] they were having a big party and all of
[1:06:44] a sudden a hand appears and and writes
[1:06:47] on on the wall uh I think it's something
[1:06:50] like meanie Meenie tickle The Parson or
[1:06:52] something like that and uh uh and so
[1:06:54] then they didn't what it said everybody
[1:06:56] was here they brought Daniel in Daniel
[1:06:58] interprets for him you know you're
[1:07:00] weighed in the balances and found
[1:07:02] wanting and brother ad is preaching this
[1:07:05] message and you realize that he's he's
[1:07:07] trying to reach out to the people and to
[1:07:09] the to the actual re religious people
[1:07:12] and churches and denominations that day
[1:07:15] and saying look it's your righteousness
[1:07:18] is in Christ but you because of your
[1:07:21] approach you're being weighed in the
[1:07:23] balances and you're being found wanting
[1:07:25] and brothers really bringing a message
[1:07:27] to actually bring a conviction and bring
[1:07:29] a correction to the people and then at
[1:07:32] the at the close of that message brother
[1:07:34] Ram said how many loves him with all
[1:07:36] your heart you're ready if he should
[1:07:38] come oh how thankful don't you feel just
[1:07:41] like you're scoured out now
[1:07:44] inside the gospel we are Washed by the
[1:07:48] Water of the word hallelujah don't you
[1:07:52] feel real good now am so see when when
[1:07:57] the words coming forth It's not the Brin
[1:07:59] condemnation for us people i' I've seen
[1:08:02] people come out of church and like man I
[1:08:03] really got whooped
[1:08:06] today and and there's been times as a
[1:08:08] pastor that I was like wow that wasn't
[1:08:11] that wasn't the way I took it when I got
[1:08:13] this thought on my mind at all you know
[1:08:16] and and and I thought it was going to be
[1:08:21] encouraging but you know look friends
[1:08:23] it's all in how you got got to look at
[1:08:26] it through God's eyes not Man's
[1:08:30] eyes we we look at it through Man's eyes
[1:08:32] and we're being uh persecuted our names
[1:08:35] being cast out as evil we lies told on
[1:08:38] us we're being abused and and all these
[1:08:40] things and we look at woe is me brother
[1:08:44] juel for would say wowy wowy
[1:08:47] wo but then you look at it Through The
[1:08:49] Eyes of Christ and he says rejoice in
[1:08:53] that day amen when they are doing that
[1:08:57] to you he said Rejoice he actually say
[1:08:59] leap for Joy he said because so did
[1:09:03] their fathers of the prophets amen so
[1:09:07] when you look at it through God's eyes
[1:09:08] you realize that it's actually showing
[1:09:12] identification right look you're not the
[1:09:15] one that's casting people's names out as
[1:09:17] evil you're not the one that's lying on
[1:09:19] somebody you're not the one that's
[1:09:20] abusing somebody you're the one that's
[1:09:22] being lied on abused so you see it shows
[1:09:25] your identification by the scripture
[1:09:27] right right right amen somebody's got to
[1:09:31] fulfill the scripture I'm thankful I'm
[1:09:33] fulfilling the part where I got to go
[1:09:35] through trials I'm thankful that I'm
[1:09:37] fulfilling the part where my name is
[1:09:39] cast out as evil I'm thankful that I'm
[1:09:41] fulfilling a part where people lie on me
[1:09:45] I don't want to fulfill that other
[1:09:49] side
[1:09:51] Hallelujah that's why looking through
[1:09:54] Jesus's eyes he can say when this
[1:09:56] happens to you rejoice leap for
[1:10:01] Joy when you look look friends Satan
[1:10:05] continuously tries to get you to look at
[1:10:07] yourself through your eyes so
[1:10:11] good we've got to look at oursel through
[1:10:14] God's eyes that's right that's friends
[1:10:17] when God looks at you he doesn't see
[1:10:21] your
[1:10:22] mistakes he doesn't see your failures
[1:10:25] he doesn't see your fault because
[1:10:28] brother Adam said look he says here you
[1:10:30] stand as a red sinner he said but the
[1:10:33] red blood of the red sacrifice God looks
[1:10:37] through red and to red and sees white as
[1:10:42] snow the red of the blood washes the red
[1:10:46] sinner white as snow so God looks
[1:10:49] through the blood and he sees you
[1:10:51] through the blood sacrifice of his own
[1:10:54] son huj he sees you holy he sees you
[1:10:59] righteous
[1:11:01] Hall so then really all you've got to
[1:11:03] contend with and deal with is your own
[1:11:10] condemnation how do you do that look at
[1:11:13] what the word says about you amen that's
[1:11:18] that's what this particular message
[1:11:19] that's on my heart is all about the
[1:11:22] washing of Water by the word is actually
[1:11:24] how am I saying you to be washed by the
[1:11:26] word today instead of looking at what
[1:11:28] Satan tells you instead of looking at
[1:11:30] what you see out of your own eyes look
[1:11:32] through the word of Jesus Christ and see
[1:11:35] what God says about
[1:11:40] you I I I've talked to people over the
[1:11:43] years at times and they' say brother
[1:11:45] Jerry I'm just having a real hard time
[1:11:46] you know seemed like I was doing so good
[1:11:49] for a while there and and I felt so good
[1:11:51] and I really felt like a Christian and
[1:11:53] all of a sudden I you know this or are
[1:11:55] that happening now look at
[1:11:57] me well look friends go back to what I
[1:12:01] read to you out of Ephesians 5 it says
[1:12:04] uh let me just go back to it instead of
[1:12:06] just trying to quote it off top of my
[1:12:07] head he said that he might present it to
[1:12:10] himself a glorious church so he washes
[1:12:14] you by the water of the word that he
[1:12:16] might present you to himself a glorious
[1:12:20] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:12:22] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:12:24] and without
[1:12:26] blemish it's not what you do you don't
[1:12:29] got to present yourself holy to God
[1:12:33] that's on Jesus
[1:12:34] Christ and he said he would do that he
[1:12:39] would present
[1:12:40] you look the Bible says this good work
[1:12:43] that he's starting in you he's faithful
[1:12:45] to finish it until the
[1:12:50] end Hallelujah you Lord look friends
[1:12:55] God it doesn't matter what you do God
[1:12:57] never gives up on his
[1:13:01] children he never reaches a place and
[1:13:03] say well now my child has went too
[1:13:08] far now not that I want to expand a lot
[1:13:12] on this but look his the the the the the
[1:13:16] the forgiveness of sin is actually the
[1:13:17] Bible says for the whole world but
[1:13:20] they've got to confess their sin and
[1:13:21] accept Christ
[1:13:25] that's good
[1:13:30] Hallelujah and God being just look
[1:13:34] friends he even had to offer Cain a way
[1:13:37] to be
[1:13:39] accepted everyone must be
[1:13:42] offered that's right the
[1:13:45] way and then you know it's on free moral
[1:13:49] agency it's their
[1:13:53] choice and then you realize friends that
[1:13:55] there are people that when they reject
[1:13:58] God's word then there is a place where
[1:14:00] brother R says they cross over the line
[1:14:03] between grace and he says then all
[1:14:06] that's left is
[1:14:09] Judgment but look friends it's
[1:14:12] impossible for the elect child of God to
[1:14:15] be
[1:14:19] lost I remember times even myself when I
[1:14:22] was a lot younger you know and I made a
[1:14:25] lot of mistakes and the devil would come
[1:14:27] and he'd say hey I want to quote to you
[1:14:28] out of
[1:14:30] Hebrews once you've been enlightened and
[1:14:32] come to the knowledge and that to to sin
[1:14:35] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:14:37] your sin there's no way back for
[1:14:39] you you knew this message was right you
[1:14:42] knew about the prophet and look what you
[1:14:44] went
[1:14:46] did and and the devil like Hebrews 6 I
[1:14:49] think in Hebrews 10 he like used them as
[1:14:51] clubs to beat on you
[1:14:55] but go listen to the message brother R
[1:14:57] preached on
[1:14:58] that and then you find out wait a minute
[1:15:01] I'm a Child of God I don't fit
[1:15:03] that
[1:15:05] amen hallu hallelujah hallu praise the
[1:15:09] Lord hallelujah friends look here's the
[1:15:13] thing with
[1:15:15] repentance it there has to be a Godly
[1:15:19] sorrow and then there's another part of
[1:15:21] repentance more than just saying I'm
[1:15:24] sorry it's actually turning from the
[1:15:30] sin so you realize for the believer for
[1:15:33] the child of God they want to turn from
[1:15:37] it but then you find so many that really
[1:15:39] what it is they just don't want to be
[1:15:41] accountable for
[1:15:43] it they don't really want to turn from
[1:15:47] it they just don't want to be held
[1:15:49] accountable look that you can see that
[1:15:52] all over this world today
[1:15:55] that's right if you you know if you'd
[1:15:58] ever take some time one time and just go
[1:16:00] sit in in in a courtroom somewhere for a
[1:16:03] day and hear the different cases that
[1:16:04] comes up and things like that you'll
[1:16:06] find out nobody wants to take be
[1:16:08] accountable for what they
[1:16:12] do would you just overlook this oh but
[1:16:17] that's not what God comes to do he
[1:16:19] didn't come to overlook anything right
[1:16:22] friends but we're we are accountability
[1:16:26] for for whatever it was God met that
[1:16:30] through Christ
[1:16:33] am you know people say Well it when
[1:16:37] Christ was crucified it was uh him being
[1:16:40] on the cross and the nails through his
[1:16:42] hand or blood he lost or the spear in
[1:16:44] his side that killed
[1:16:46] him brother said no he said it was the
[1:16:50] weight of the sins of the world that God
[1:16:54] put on
[1:16:56] him that actually broke him and took his
[1:17:03] life if you ever study about a
[1:17:06] crucifixion friends they a crucifixion
[1:17:08] was a very slow uh painful way to
[1:17:13] die a man would uh be up there on the
[1:17:18] cross and slowly he would suffocate
[1:17:20] because he would uh he would lose
[1:17:23] strength to try to push himself up so
[1:17:25] his diaphrag begin to crush and so
[1:17:28] slowly they actually
[1:17:30] suffocated it was a long and
[1:17:34] painful capital
[1:17:38] punishment but look in the scripture
[1:17:40] Christ it would last friends if you
[1:17:42] study this you find crucifixions would
[1:17:44] last for days
[1:17:46] sometimes with Jesus Christ it did not
[1:17:51] hallu he died he died within a manner of
[1:17:56] ours why it wasn't the cross it wasn't
[1:18:00] the crucifixion it wasn't the spear it
[1:18:03] wasn't the nails it was none of those
[1:18:05] things it was my sin that was put on him
[1:18:10] that killed
[1:18:11] him what what what am I saying he paid
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:16] price Hallelujah that's what I was
[1:18:18] worthy
[1:18:20] of that's what you were Worthy ofall
[1:18:25] he was he was without
[1:18:28] blemish he was a sacrifice without
[1:18:31] blemish he was a sacrifice that never
[1:18:33] had a yoke on him
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:37] Hallelujah even pilate you realized they
[1:18:41] had to in the Old Testament they had to
[1:18:43] inspect the sacrifice before they
[1:18:45] offered it and the sacrifice couldn't
[1:18:47] have any blemishes on it right it had to
[1:18:50] be a perfect uh uh animal sacrifice
[1:18:55] yes and here stands
[1:18:57] pilate of Roman and he says I find no
[1:19:04] fault hallelujah what was that that was
[1:19:07] a proclamation this sacrifice is
[1:19:10] worthy we've got a wor we had a worthy
[1:19:14] sacrifice Hallelujah he was
[1:19:18] sinless the Bible said yes he was tested
[1:19:22] and tried in every way such as knowing
[1:19:24] to man yet without
[1:19:28] sin but there's no way for us to face
[1:19:31] this life without sin the Bible said if
[1:19:34] we say we have no sin then the truth's
[1:19:37] not even in
[1:19:40] us
[1:19:42] hallelujah
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:45] hallelujah
[1:19:48] hallelujah turn with me to Hebrews
[1:19:50] chapter 10 and I'm I'm going to kind of
[1:19:53] just skip through some vers verses here
[1:19:55] I'll start with verse
[1:19:57] two and uh I'll tell you each verse that
[1:19:59] I want to read to get this point
[1:20:08] across Hebrews chapter 10
[1:20:11] verse2 for then would they not have
[1:20:14] ceased to be offered now this is Paul
[1:20:16] talking about the the the sacrifices
[1:20:18] that were offered in the Old Testament
[1:20:21] for the sin of the
[1:20:23] people and that sacrifice Paul said had
[1:20:25] to be offered every year but now he's
[1:20:28] talking about the coming of Christ as
[1:20:29] the sacrifice says and then Paul goes on
[1:20:31] to say he said that there's no more need
[1:20:34] for another sacrifice let's read here uh
[1:20:37] for then would they not have ceased to
[1:20:39] be offered because that the worshipper
[1:20:41] once purged should have no more
[1:20:44] conscience of
[1:20:46] sins now look down to verse 12 but this
[1:20:49] man after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:20:52] for sin forever
[1:20:54] sat down at the right hand of God verse
[1:20:57] 14 for by one offering he hath perfected
[1:21:02] forever them that are Sanctified
[1:21:06] Hallelujah and verse 17 and their sins
[1:21:10] and iniquities will I remember no
[1:21:13] more Verse 18 now where remission of
[1:21:16] these is there is no more offering for
[1:21:21] sin brother bam says this in the message
[1:21:23] of Jubilee 1954 he said he quotes that
[1:21:27] scripture once for by one sacrifice has
[1:21:30] he perfected forever those who are
[1:21:31] Sanctified in Christ Jesus once for all
[1:21:35] he says oh you'll backslide you'll do
[1:21:39] things that's wrong but one time Christ
[1:21:43] sanctifies a human soul by filling him
[1:21:46] with the holy spirit it's perfected
[1:21:49] forever there you are no more desire to
[1:21:53] do the wrong
[1:21:55] hallah for the worshipper once purged
[1:21:57] has no more conscience he said that
[1:21:59] means
[1:22:02] desire has no more desire of the sin
[1:22:06] nowhere for he has perfected by one
[1:22:09] sacrifice forever those that are in
[1:22:12] Christ Jesus that is so good am yes sir
[1:22:16] Hallelujah
[1:22:25] when the Fulfillment of the promise of
[1:22:27] the Messiah was was when God began to
[1:22:30] move and he moved on Mary to bring to
[1:22:35] pass this fulfillment through this
[1:22:37] vessel and brother Ram says God created
[1:22:41] a blood cell in Mary he says and that
[1:22:45] blood cell he said it didn't come from a
[1:22:47] man or a woman it was the creation of
[1:22:50] God righten it was he said a blood cell
[1:22:54] God created he says and that blood cell
[1:22:58] began to
[1:23:00] multiply and he says until it became a
[1:23:03] infant in the womb of
[1:23:05] Mary he says then it was the baby was
[1:23:10] born and he says and it was the creation
[1:23:14] of God it didn't come through fleshly
[1:23:19] desire and he says then he says then
[1:23:23] Christ comes then
[1:23:25] as he reaches that age and it comes the
[1:23:27] time for him to be that to to come and
[1:23:31] and and fulfill be in that sacrifice he
[1:23:34] says that blood cell he said what you
[1:23:37] know the blood cell has the that's where
[1:23:40] the life is is in the blood cell he says
[1:23:43] then that blood cell Christ shed his
[1:23:46] blood he said that blood cell was burst
[1:23:49] he says and from there then becomes the
[1:23:51] life of God to come back on the Believer
[1:23:55] by the blood of Jesus
[1:23:59] Christ yes sir and when that has
[1:24:02] happened to the believer friends look

[1:24:19] laws or or keeping good works or or
[1:24:22] doing good things friends look it

[1:27:25] but my love to him he lets me live for
[1:27:28] him he said and if I found out I do
[1:27:31] something then I'm chastened of the Lord
[1:27:34] why does God do this that we wouldn't be
[1:27:37] condemned with the
[1:27:41] world what is that word condemn there
[1:27:44] you know you it comes from what what uh
[1:27:46] in the scripture uh where where it talks
[1:27:50] about not being condemned with the world
[1:27:52] what it's talking about being dead damed
[1:27:55] right right
[1:27:58] hallelujah hallelujah brother R says
[1:28:01] this in in the deity of Jesus Christ he
[1:28:03] says he said this is where I got that
[1:28:05] from where he says people don't realize
[1:28:07] who you don't realize who you are he
[1:28:09] said he said every person in here can
[1:28:11] live above sin can live without sin
[1:28:13] Living God you'll make mistakes right
[1:28:17] but the blood of Jesus Christ will
[1:28:19] forgive you
[1:28:22] hallelujah thank you Lord I'm sure
[1:28:24] you're so familiar with it so many times
[1:28:26] it's been referred to I think I actually
[1:28:28] preached a message some years ago here
[1:28:30] and and used uh the the entire interview
[1:28:33] of sister Bruce where brother bam
[1:28:35] interviewed this sister prior to
[1:28:36] preaching the message of the Masterpiece
[1:28:39] and but I just want to point to a little
[1:28:41] section that's in this interview and you
[1:28:43] know she came to brother brandom because
[1:28:46] she said she wasn't feeling worthy she
[1:28:48] didn't she didn't feel like she had the
[1:28:50] Holy Ghost she didn't feel right and and
[1:28:52] that and so brother r says look he says
[1:28:56] uh uh when God looks at us he says I'm
[1:28:59] not a sinner and neither are you we got
[1:29:01] the blood sacrifice laying there God
[1:29:03] don't even see us he hears our voice but
[1:29:06] he sees the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:29:08] said he sees the blood of his own son
[1:29:11] it's our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:29:13] Christ that's talking through us to God
[1:29:16] so therefore we're not Sinners no more
[1:29:18] we're Christians he says and I believe
[1:29:20] you are a genuine Christian woman and
[1:29:23] and and she says uh but I make so many
[1:29:27] mistakes and I fail so many times and
[1:29:30] brother and said that's why Christ had
[1:29:33] to die so that you with your mistakes
[1:29:36] wouldn't be lotted to
[1:29:38] you he took your mistakes he says look
[1:29:42] the desire of your heart is to serve him
[1:29:44] now I go back to the worshipper once
[1:29:47] Purge has no more conscience or brother
[1:29:50] says desire of sin you'll make mistakes
[1:29:53] but it's not not because you have that
[1:29:56] desire and because that desire is not
[1:29:59] there when God brings a correction or or
[1:30:02] points out this area where you need to
[1:30:04] make a a repentance of friends the
[1:30:07] desire in your heart is to be right
[1:30:09] before God so you nobody's got to Prime
[1:30:12] you or pump you you're willingly as soon
[1:30:14] as it comes to the believer's conscience
[1:30:17] he oh Lord forgive me I'm sorry I didn't
[1:30:19] mean to do
[1:30:22] that cleanse me Lord cleanse me
[1:30:26] Lord hall
[1:30:30] hallelujah
[1:30:33] hallelujah and he says your desire in
[1:30:35] your heart to serve him she said that's
[1:30:37] right he said that's what he died for so
[1:30:40] you could serve him your mistakes are
[1:30:41] not looked at not lotted to you he's
[1:30:44] your perpetuation he's your sin offering
[1:30:47] your sins are not knowing you're not a
[1:30:48] sinner before God Christ took your sins
[1:30:51] and became you because your desire is to
[1:30:54] serve
[1:30:56] him
[1:30:59] Hallelujah the Bible says as a man
[1:31:02] thinketh in his
[1:31:05] heart brother Adam says in the message
[1:31:07] of Fellowship he says you know he said
[1:31:10] science come out and said God was wrong
[1:31:12] about that his word's wrong about that
[1:31:14] man doesn't think with his
[1:31:17] heart brother man said they say he
[1:31:19] thinks with his mind his head he said
[1:31:21] well yes that's your intellect right and
[1:31:24] he said that's actually says a lot of
[1:31:26] people's problems when they come up for
[1:31:27] prayer is they say they got faith he
[1:31:29] said but it's all intellect it's all
[1:31:32] intellectual
[1:31:35] Faith he said but let that let that
[1:31:38] Faith drop he here here from the
[1:31:40] intellect and come down here and hit in
[1:31:43] the
[1:31:46] heart then every sickness every disease
[1:31:49] everything that Satan com is defeated
[1:31:52] Hallelujah
[1:31:57] Hallelujah as a man think in his heart
[1:31:59] Brother s but they have found out in
[1:32:00] medical science that there actually is a
[1:32:03] chamber in a person's heart that there's
[1:32:05] not even a blood cell there and he said
[1:32:08] that is where the soul is that now they
[1:32:11] can't find that on an X-ray your soul
[1:32:14] they can't pick it up on an MRI they
[1:32:17] can't pick it up on some kind of a
[1:32:21] scan hallu amen but it's
[1:32:25] there and that's what God sees
[1:32:29] Hallelujah so let the washing of the
[1:32:31] water of the word let the word come and

[1:32:49] that Hallelujah Lord Brother R said look
[1:32:52] Satan can't read your mind he can give
[1:32:54] you a thought but he he can't read your
[1:32:57] mind he says he'll give you a thought
[1:33:00] and then he stands back and watches see
[1:33:02] what is your reaction going to be to
[1:33:03] that
[1:33:04] the that's right I was talking to
[1:33:07] brother Dan daisley was many years ago I
[1:33:11] went and I was my wife and I were there
[1:33:13] we visited him in his
[1:33:15] home and we were sitting there talking
[1:33:17] to him in that and he G he gave me some
[1:33:19] personal testimonies about himself and I
[1:33:22] was like amazed brother Dan was saying
[1:33:25] you know one of the things he struggled
[1:33:26] with he says I get to feel like nobody
[1:33:28] cares about me nobody loves
[1:33:30] me and I thought man brother Dan you are
[1:33:34] loved all over the place everybody loves
[1:33:37] you and loves your ministry and I
[1:33:39] thought about the church up here you
[1:33:40] know that had been helped so many
[1:33:42] different times over the years by his
[1:33:44] ministry back then and that and I
[1:33:45] thought everybody loves you they love to
[1:33:47] hear you preach and all that but he said
[1:33:49] look it was the devil it was in his mind
[1:33:51] it was a thought the devil's going
[1:33:52] nobody cares about
[1:33:54] nobody loves you it shows that was the
[1:33:57] human man there that was the
[1:34:00] Flesh and then he shared with me he says
[1:34:03] he was talking to brother Perry green
[1:34:04] one time and he said and brother Perry
[1:34:07] gave him a testimony that he was he
[1:34:09] brother Perry was with brother brandham
[1:34:11] and he was feeling so condemned and he
[1:34:13] was feeling so bad and finally he told
[1:34:15] Brother BR said I know you can just tell
[1:34:17] what's wrong with me because you're a
[1:34:19] prophet he says but he says I have the
[1:34:21] most awfulest I've been having the most
[1:34:23] a awless evil thoughts he
[1:34:27] said and brother brandom told Brother
[1:34:30] Perry he said look he said that's just
[1:34:32] the devil they're not your thoughts he
[1:34:36] said but these thoughts from the devil
[1:34:37] he says they're just like birds he says
[1:34:41] you can't stop them from flying over he
[1:34:44] said but you don't got to let them Nest
[1:34:45] there right that's what brother brandom
[1:34:48] told Brother Perry and he shared this
[1:34:50] testimony with me said don't let him
[1:34:53] Nest there that's our problem a lot of
[1:34:55] times the devil brings the thought and
[1:34:57] we get the dwelling on it that's what he
[1:34:58] meant by letting it Nest
[1:35:02] there yeah that's not
[1:35:05] me I don't know where that thought come
[1:35:08] from listen to this there was a a a
[1:35:11] preacher one time brother Brandon was
[1:35:13] having a prayer line and he asked the
[1:35:15] preachers that were up on the pull pit
[1:35:17] come and stand with me lay hands on
[1:35:18] these people and help me pray for these
[1:35:20] people and there was one particular
[1:35:22] preacher that he wouldn't step up there
[1:35:24] he he stayed back and brother brandham
[1:35:27] then after said brother why didn't you
[1:35:28] come up why why did you stay back he
[1:35:30] said brother brandom he said by the time
[1:35:32] he said I had the most filthiest thought
[1:35:34] he said went through my mind and I
[1:35:36] thought oh I'm not worth I'm not going
[1:35:38] to go up there and lay hands on brother
[1:35:39] Bram said I apologize to you brother I'm
[1:35:42] so sorry he said that thought was meant
[1:35:44] for me he said and you stepped in the
[1:35:48] way of it wow wow

[1:35:56] you know he makes this statement I'm not
[1:36:01] perfect he says and I never will be in

[1:36:20] what do you think here not what you
[1:36:21] think in here right this is where Satan
[1:36:24] attacks you at but friends he can't
[1:36:26] attack you in
[1:36:28] here hallelujah so what do you think
[1:36:30] about yourself in here I'll tell you
[1:36:33] what your thought is in here your
[1:36:34] thought in here comes from look you are
[1:36:37] as much apart as God as Christ
[1:36:42] himself and as Christ was the word is
[1:36:46] the word you are the word you're part of
[1:36:49] the
[1:36:50] word you and Christ are one

[1:36:57] can no more die than God can die
[1:37:01] Hall yes this body might die and go by
[1:37:04] the way of the grave but you can't
[1:37:09] die there'll be No Grave that can hold
[1:37:12] this body
[1:37:15] downall there is no condemnation of the
[1:37:18] devil that can prevent me from having a
[1:37:21] body change when that time comes
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:28] my change is not dependent on how good a
[1:37:31] person I
[1:37:33] am it's dependent on there's already
[1:37:36] been a change happening
[1:37:38] here brother said before you can have
[1:37:40] that change in and be resurrected or
[1:37:43] have that change in the time of the
[1:37:45] Resurrection he said there first must
[1:37:46] have been a change or Resurrection
[1:37:49] Happening Here
[1:37:54] Paul speaks of it as that being the the
[1:37:57] proof that we've got a deed to
[1:38:01] this it's the
[1:38:05] proof
[1:38:07] Hallelujah hallu that is our inheritance
[1:38:10] and our proof is it's already happened
[1:38:13] in
[1:38:16] here
[1:38:18] hallelujah and that's how that I know
[1:38:21] that on the day when the rapture takes
[1:38:23] place when the dead in Christ rise I
[1:38:26] know that the word by the promise of the
[1:38:30] word I'll be changed if I'm still
[1:38:33] alive I'll be changed from this vile
[1:38:37] body
[1:38:38] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:38:41] praise
[1:38:42] God let me let me just drop this to you
[1:38:44] you know how the Bible tells us and
[1:38:46] brother brand emphasizes on it that
[1:38:48] during the time of the Millennium that
[1:38:51] he said Satan will be bound for a
[1:38:53] Thousand Years brother Ram says he's not
[1:38:56] it's not bound by like a physical chain
[1:38:59] brother ram calls a logging chain to try
[1:39:01] to give you a description of what he's
[1:39:03] saying it's not something of a physical
[1:39:05] chain he said but it's a chain of
[1:39:09] circumstance what is that
[1:39:11] circumstance the circumstance is look
[1:39:13] friends now he's he can attack you
[1:39:16] because of the mind he can attack you
[1:39:18] because of this flesh he can attack you
[1:39:20] because of your memory and your spirit
[1:39:22] and these things
[1:39:26] but in the in that time what he's Bound
[1:39:29] by is you're not going to be in this
[1:39:30] flesh you're going to be in a changed
[1:39:32] body you know a glorified body that's
[1:39:35] wrapped around a theophany not a human
[1:39:39] Spirit the Lord a memory that's been
[1:39:44] wiped remember brother random referring
[1:39:46] to he says you know when the Rapture
[1:39:48] takes place we go into the marriage
[1:39:50] supper of the Lamb he says you'll be
[1:39:51] sitting there at the table he says
[1:39:53] people begin to look around and say and
[1:39:55] they'll begin to miss certain ones that
[1:39:58] are not there they didn't make it right
[1:40:00] and he said and when that happens he
[1:40:02] says Jesus will come around and he'll
[1:40:04] wipe that from your memory Hallelujah he
[1:40:07] said he has to wipe that from your
[1:40:08] memory hallu so it can be heaven for you
[1:40:12] right so you won't you won't be
[1:40:15] remembering all these ones that didn't
[1:40:18] make it you won't be
[1:40:20] remembering uh you know I did this or i'
[1:40:22] done that matter whatever friends oh my
[1:40:25] goodness look you don't got to wait till
[1:40:28] the marriage supp of the Lamb to fill
[1:40:29] that Liberty and freedom you can feel
[1:40:32] that Liberty and freedom today by
[1:40:34] allowing the word to wash
[1:40:38] you look at what the word says about you
[1:40:41] who you
[1:40:42] are
[1:40:43] Hallelujah as a man thinketh in his
[1:40:46] heart hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:53] B says it's not how good you can be it's
[1:40:56] accepting what Christ has done
[1:40:59] amen hallelujah all right let me bring
[1:41:02] this to a
[1:41:04] close you know people that uh have maybe
[1:41:11] done things in their
[1:41:13] past i' I've actually even dealt with
[1:41:16] relatives that they they really struggle
[1:41:18] sometimes in their mind because of of
[1:41:21] things they did in their past and
[1:41:23] and they feel so bad about it maybe they
[1:41:25] can go on for a while they feel okay but
[1:41:27] then these things come back to their
[1:41:29] mind and and they think oh I did this
[1:41:31] you know remember I did this oh I was a
[1:41:33] bad mother or I was a bad father or I
[1:41:35] was this or whatever you know the thing
[1:41:38] is they say the problem people have is
[1:41:41] is forgiving
[1:41:43] themselves they can't let go they keep
[1:41:46] living in the past no because they have
[1:41:49] trouble forgiving themselves right amen
[1:41:52] and and you know in Psychology today
[1:41:54] they say you know a person has to
[1:41:55] forgive themselves and quit punishing
[1:41:58] themselves for those
[1:41:59] things but then brother branam gives the
[1:42:02] illustration about the man during the
[1:42:05] time of the Civil War that was actually
[1:42:08] uh brought up on charges because he said
[1:42:10] he had abandoned his post and and and so
[1:42:14] it said uh you know uh here he was going
[1:42:18] to be uh executed for that face a firing
[1:42:21] squad and so the mother of this boy
[1:42:25] writes President
[1:42:27] Lincoln and so this came comes before
[1:42:30] President Lincoln so President Lincoln
[1:42:32] he writes and signs a pardon for the
[1:42:35] young man and they take the pardon down
[1:42:38] there and when they get down they tell
[1:42:40] him the president of the United States
[1:42:42] we've got a pardon right in our hand for
[1:42:44] you uh that he's pardoned you you can go
[1:42:47] free and he and the man said I don't
[1:42:49] believe
[1:42:50] it and so the the story go the young man
[1:42:54] end up being executed for it and what
[1:42:56] the decision they made was that a pardon
[1:42:59] is only a pardon if it's accepted as a
[1:43:03] pardon so look your pardon there you've
[1:43:06] got Christ paid the price he is your
[1:43:10] pardon he's issued God has issued a
[1:43:13] pardon for
[1:43:15] you but you got to accept
[1:43:20] it accept his forgiveness
[1:43:26] you say how do I forgive
[1:43:27] myself you didn't you weren't the one
[1:43:30] who did
[1:43:32] it that was that old man that was that
[1:43:34] old nature youve buried them
[1:43:37] amen it's been cleansed and Washed by
[1:43:40] the blood of Jesus Christ that new life
[1:43:42] that's come in you that life never did
[1:43:44] those things that's
[1:43:46] right yeah maybe this body but one day
[1:43:49] you're going to have a body that matches
[1:43:50] what's inside amen hallelujah
[1:43:53] praise the Lord hallelujah brother Ram
[1:43:57] is speaking here in the message of
[1:43:59] Victory Day He
[1:44:01] says um he said heavenly father I'm so
[1:44:07] in debt to you there's no way I could
[1:44:08] ever pay the debt of my sin I was in a
[1:44:12] Cell one day cuz I was born in that
[1:44:15] cell and he said I knew I I I know what

[1:44:22] great and I couldn't pay it but I'm so
[1:44:25] glad that the day you visited my C he's
[1:44:27] feeling his cell like it's being in jail
[1:44:30] in prison he said I recognized it that
[1:44:33] you were the only one uh that could
[1:44:36] pardon the only way I could ever be free
[1:44:38] was to have a victory a complete victory
