for His mercy and for these services the Lord has given to us and so much that God has spoke to our hearts amen you just say Lord just just help me to be captured and to capture all of it you know God knows what we have need of just you know in its season but you know there's things that we look at in our lives and we say lord help us to so capture this by by revelation to where in our lives it's it's lived out through our lives you take for example the service on Sunday and even Thursday but regarding the grace of God you know it's a wonderful wonderful reality that God has brought to our hearts it's wonderful to revisit amen those grounds it meant sacred sands of God's grace to see the working of God's grace in our lives and even in the midst of the trial it still His grace even in the midst of the times where it's tough it still is grace and it's that same grace not a different grace that same grace that is more precious and more precious and more precious through every journey what we recognize and see is that it is God His infinite grace that has a hold upon our lives that's why that's why we love him so amen so we just would certainly just appreciate what the Lord has done what he's doing and we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord tonight and just get right into the word and just ask the Lord to speak to our hearts once again and this is the service here tonight so if you'd like to stand with me I'd like to go right to First Samuel chapter 14 and I just want to read some verses of Scripture there tonight let's just begin at verse 1 of 4 Samuel 14 says now it came to pass upon a day that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bear his armor come and let us go over to the Philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told not his father we go down to verse 4 let's just go straight to verse 4 and between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the unto the Philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was Moses and the name of the other seen the forefront of the one was situate northward over against mcNeish and the other southward over against Gibeon Jonathan said to the young man that bear his armor come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the law to save by many or by few and his armor-bearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turned thee behold I am with thee according to that heart let's just bow our heads an order prayer love is if you want to get it I sent it in the file back there Lord Jesus we are Lord just so thankful for your mercy and your grace once again today Lord we have come here tonight Lord not to be seen but we've come here to hear from you Lord you know our needs tonight Lord you know every every heart Lord that would be gathered here tonight you know each one of us Lord and father we just Lord invite you that you would come Lord for what you've laid Lord on my heart that you would take it and deliver it Lord to the hearts of your children tonight Lord that father you would Lord just come Lord and let the word go on just search our hearts let it come Lord to direct us Lord and guide us Lord may you just take control of speaker and hear together Lord and father just lord have your way Lord in this service tonight we pray Lord we commit our hearts ourselves to you and Lord for every request that was read here Lord in the Lord and the service Lord some that are not here because of sickness Lord Lord are there other reasons Lord but God you know father and we just pray that God that you would just reach out Lord to every heart in every life Oh God we pray O God that Lord that you would just speaks so personally to us tonight we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then God blesses your being seated I want to keep on reading there if we could verse seven and his armor-bearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turned thee behold I am with thee according to thy heart then said Johnathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines and the Philistine said behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves and the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said come up to us and we will show you a thing and Jonathan said unto his armor-bearer come up after me for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armor-bearer after him and they fell before Jonathan and his armor-bearer slew after him and that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made was about twenty men within as it were in half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling I want to just just speak tonight here just just pressing from verse just really drawing from verse six and verse 7 I was actually drawn to some other things and this dis is what just it just stood out to my heart in verse 6 and verse 7 and I'd like to just if we could just to speak on tonight there's no restraint with the Lord and if we could a subtitle in there onward Christian soldiers and when we look here at verse 6 and 7 just to draw our attention here here is Jonathan here with his armor-bearer they are away from the camp Saul and them do not know that they're away but remember Jonathan and his armor-bearer are mindful that the Philistines are the enemy and one thing that you see in verse 6 is that the the children of God the believer when we are walking in tune with God then we're not seeing things just to our own eyesight but we're looking at how that the enemy is expose before us you think about when when God used David and David looks upon Goliath David that the thing that David is drawn to is not his size neither what it is that Goliath is wearing but he's drawn to the fact that this is an uncircumcised Philistine he has no backing there is no covenant he is vulnerable and so David is not looking at all of the armor he's looking at he's vulnerable and this is where Jonathan and his armor bearer as Jonathan said let us go over in verse 6 unto the garrison the garrison there would be many as it said there were twenty it was like you a place that the where they're gathered together there in a stronghold that's another term for garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us for there is no restraint there's no hindrance to the Lord to save by many or by few and I really enjoy where is what his armor-bearer says in this time do all that is in thine heart the armor bearer recognizes this is in Jonathan's heart Jonathan is speaking according to the word of the Lord and so the armor bearer says do all that's in your heart behold I am with thee according to thy heart so there's a pound where if we look at this very clearly you find so much that was spoken here with Jonathan recognizing the conditions that are around them there's a power I've said tonight there's a power in confession it is it is always for every person when God gets ahold of a person's life they've turned their heart over to the Lord right then and there it ought to be that they make a declaration and let it be known I have been saved and when you make that big you are you are confessing what God has done in your life and every one of us remember that moment when we surrendered a heart and It was as though the load it was a load that was lifted but below that we felt lifted is the load of sin that our Savior already born and we are identifying with him our heart is uniting with his heart that he is my sin bearer he is my Savior and we are making a confession based on what he has done and who he is in our life and you that the Bible tells us in Revelations 12 that they overcame they overcame Satan by the the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony you know even when God as God takes ahold of the life and that life might have all kinds of habits 5 I was lost but now I've been found and you find that as you begin to speak according to the heart of God remember the heart of God is Christ being revealed and as you speak according to what the word is saying and made known in your life then it is God coming to back of the word that you are expressing because you are not speaking your own thoughts I am saved he meant been doing God moves you know a greater work as we heard here on Sunday then you keep confessing what he has done and if you look in your life and you can say well I see this I see that but confess who he is he has made in 1st Corinthians 1:30 he hath made him to be our perfection our sanctification our wisdom our righteousness you see he is the high priest of our confession and this is if there's a power in confession you know this is why brother Graham would say you take for example a person that could go out and say I'm no longer safe he said you watch that life go right down but when a person will testify God has saved me and you watch that workers righteousness because let me tell you something God backs up his works it's a power of confession you know it's like this listen now Jonathan is not just out here grabbing loose straws you see what Jonathan what's coming back to his mind is in Jonathan knows that if God ever moved before that same God will move again when the same conditions present themselves when faith is present God will act the same way that's what Jonathan is standing upon you see he's got a word you know faith rest in the Word of God faith doesn't rest in our feelings it rests in the word of God that's why we don't go by our feelings whether we're saved or not we we go by the Word of God of what God has said if I confess my sins he is faithful and just to forgive me and cleanse me from all unrighteousness to meet the conditions to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you might say I don't feel but it's not what we feel it's what the word has said he men Jonathan could rest in the word of the Lord I want to just hear it just pull this in John just over 23 Joshua telling the children of Israel here he's giving them counsel before his departure and I remember this is the promised land of the believer what we read in our text is where Jonathan and his armor-bearer the children of Israel are dwelling in the promised land and here is a promise that job Jonathan will no doubt going back upon his heart that you see here he says in verse 8 cleave unto the Lord your God as ye have done unto this day for the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong now remember Israel was not that of a mighty nation within themselves the armies of the land the other nations that were in the land were as far as army they were superior but what made the difference was God was on their side and you you just you lookin in your life in my life as a believer though all hail has held me yet I shall not be moved Israel a little itty-bitty country in the world and when you pull up just pull up some time on the Six Day War and look at all the flags of all the other countries that were against one little flag and not one of them could overthrow why because it is God's chosen you say what are you saying well I might be kind of getting ahead of myself but size has nothing to do with it you might feel very small in stature in your life tonight and say I can't quote this I don't know this chapter I don't know this scripture but if you can just say Lord have your way in my lives then the author of the book can move and brother he can fulfill words that are wrote in here in your life and then direct you back to it and you say that was fulfilled in my life sometimes the more we know here the less we yield here the more we know here the more the enemy our can try to use that against us but it's not that we don't read we ought to give ourselves to the Word of God but it's to realize that God Himself is not working by numbers so let me just finish this but has for you no man has been able to stand before you unto this day one man of you shall chase a thousand and no right now you look at and say dear Lord one against a thousand but you gotta remember who's back in the one that's what you got to remember who's back in the one one man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God he it is that fight is for you as he hath promised now you find how God works in such a great proportion in Deuteronomy 30 to 30 he says one shot chase a thousand and two will put Tim thousand to flight what we read in our text you do not hear Jonathan quoting this but yet the principle that he's standing on is based on the Word of God he Jonathan no doubt had so lived in that word till it wasn't about him remembered chapters and verse he had become so one with the character of the god of the word til when situations arose he spoke like God would speak when the situation arose taurah be to god somebody say lord help me be that kind of a man help me be that kind of a woman amen you know God specializes this is all the way through the scripture he specializes in taking people who seemingly are unfit for the task and would be outmatched outnumbered and God says that's what I need God doesn't need numbers when God got ready to go down and to deliver his people in Exodus 3 according to the promise remember he had to get one man first God has done the same thing down through the ages God would get man first and then that one man would be an instrument used by God just like it was in this generation that would make God real to you and I and what does it do it brings us to the awareness that he is still the same God amen and here God either let it be known I've come down to deliver Israel and I'm gonna send you now think about this Egypt is the mightiest nation in the world there might be something you're facing in your life that's pretty mighty and it might be the one that you're facing in your life or whatever the opposition is God has called you to be the vessel that he will manifest his glory through your life he meant a mighty it was a a mighty God coming down and here he takes one to be his spokesman who can't even talk right all of the weaknesses that Moses had becomes exposed in the presence of God aren't you glad God does that now your flesh will say no but the inside man says yes none of us like to be exposed and all of the you know our weaknesses but you see God knows that there is a part of you that's really him and the part of you that's really him is the part that God deals with because the part of you that's really him then that part it brings in subjection the other part pora be to God you see this is why brother Brennan would tell us God can do more with 15 in his hand than he could with 1500 out of his hand remember what the hand of God is it is the power of God it is the very person of God revealed this we think of a hand it's symbol as you find it in the Old Testament you find it over in the New Testament the hand of God it is God connecting with man and you find how he says God can do more with 15 in his hand than he could with 1500 out of his hand he said we appreciate 1500 in his hand instead of 15 in his hand if they'll stay in his hand that's the main thing being influenced not by what Britain numbers we are but what a great God that were representing and the kind of life that is in us by him that will influence others you see every time things get big man begins to think of himself you you know victories go on in our life and after you know victory after victory then we get to thinking as though it was us to done it now you might sit here and you you would disagree with me but let me just let me just show how this could be without dwelling on it tonight you see when victory after victory comes then you pull back on prayer then you pull back on reading and at the very moment it's you're letting your guard down and you're getting ready to get socked that's a separate that was free tonight but it was separate brother Bram said in spirit of truth I would rather have a church with fifty people in it in the will of God than to go have five thousand out of the will of God God can do more with a man in his will in one hour than he could with a man out of his will in 50 years notice in each one of these quotes God can God can do more not with about numbers but with surrendered hearts Jonathan and his armor-bearer were united in heart in purpose in motive and objective God can do more he says now notice he talked about that 50 years he is stumbling and staggering like shooting in the dark but when a man is really in the will of God and knows his calling he should abide there amen one man surrendered into his hands fully that's all God needs now look at this example in the book of Judges here God is in judges 6 16 he speaks to Gideon and he says surely I will be with thee and thou shalt smack the Midianites as one man now how God speaks to Gideon then notice how that God working with Gideon you know he first has got to get Gideon to have confidence in what the word is declaring about him you isn't then once now Gideon that confidence is within his life then God could speak to Gideon in judges 7 2 and he tells him the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands now let me remind you without reading about it the Midianites that were there out there that had come up to eat and to take of the wheat that where they had come the Bible that it speaks them and they were just like as grasshopper they were JIT they just like covered the landscape and here God tells Gideon the amount of people you've got with you is too much now let me just tell you right now he was already short-handed when it changed number two numbers all right he was already short hunters short-handed but then God lets him know there's too many for me to give the Midianites ooh their hands in this something God did not tell gideon this at the beginning i mean getting it was already afraid but now as god in his long-suffering and patience he reveals to Gideon who he is then God can let him know that's too many then are with you for me to give the Midianites into their hands lest Israel thought themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me so god goes on in tells him in verse three I want you to go tell in the ears of the people whoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead and there went from the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand now maybe get in fact who listen to it okay there's ten thousand left and God speaks to him again the people are yet too many my god is narrowing it down he's weeding it down bring them down unto the water and I will try them Ford V there in and amazing the final step is the water the final place of separation is the water they met in the final moment for Rebecca which he came to the water they met water being a type of the Holy Ghost bring them down to the water and God let him know those who get down on both knees and lap like a dog set him aside now you let him get to the water I hope you understand I don't want to read it because I got some other things I just want to drop here tonight he God let him know when he got him down to the water God didn't tell Gideon ahead of time he wanted get in to watch the people how the people would respond to the water whether they were going to try to make an idol out of the water or allow the water to move through them you understand to just make an idol out of it or allow the water to move through them yes I hope you understand what I'm saying here tonight we enjoy the presence of Almighty God but brother let me tell you something if this presence if it's only here that you sense that then you might want to look at how that you're you know you're drinking the water it's not just something where I come to church my when I come to church I'm gonna get beside myself you are to live beside yourself every day don't let the devil sell you short on that you say what do you saying don't treat it like an idle Amen the Holy Ghost ain't an idle it's the person of the Living God it's not like other idols that they have ears but they can't hear they have mouths but they can't speak but the person of Jesus Christ and the promise is that when he has come he said he'll lead and guide us into all truth he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you now I lift the always so he said set aside those who get down and they take the hand why because they're looking for him they are taking of the water of life and they're looking for the promise to be fulfilled you see their God here in verse 7 coming into this place here the Lord tells Gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will I save you oh Lord they went from thirty-two thousand to ten thousand to three hundred I don't know what kind of proportions those are but I do know what it comes out to be it comes out to be just about one percent of what they're going to be fighting and when you look at this in the natural you'd say wait a minute God should have been building him up obey God was you see with all the rest of that unbelief that was hanging around fear and afraid and those you know making an idol out of the message and other things like I got said I can't use them at all I can only use those who still left the water and the water brother and sister you can't separate the Holy Ghost and the word it's one in the same hey man listen you've got there's got to be a delight in by these 300 I will deliver Midian into that hand glory be to God let all the rest of them go back into the place I say God let us be dedicated to God in this manner it's a separation that's what was taking place here you know you think about it over the years and some of you that are you know much older than I am my how the numbers themselves seemingly have dwindled right you know and you even see that even in the midst of dwindling you see isms and everything else that's raising up you know because people want to rally around something but God sent in this hour the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about brother Branham brother Brent said I'm not God's gift to you the Holy Ghost is God's gift hey man and we're to rally around the Holy Ghost and listen friends here with you and I would have missed it but God had one of the stars in the right hand that would reflect his presence on earth in this hour that we can recognize a word that is brought to you and I then we can recognize who we are think about think about this think about it some of us have not maybe experienced that but I think about you know my dad I think about other brothers when God even as brother oil was standing here brothers from the Philippines that when the word has come to them here they are standing as pastors and ministers over great organizations of people they've got a choice do I walk with the word or do I stay with a big group of people now you might look and say wow what a choice they have but you know every one of us have their choice you have a choice what choice are you gonna make are you gonna even allow something to sidetrack you or you're gonna say lord I know how to fix everything else there might be a lot of things in your life that you say need to be fixing and this needs to come and this needs to come to remember you can't do it but if you keep your eyes and your heart United with God God will do what God does you keep your heart United with him and God will give you the desires of your heart that's a promise in this so God knows God doesn't need numbers he just needs surrendered hearts you think about this I don't have time maybe to read it but in first chronicles 12 when David was running from Saul there were many the Bible would call him helpers mighty men that were coming to David where David was gathered and they were coming to be of the help God was moving on their hearts in their lives and even when those of the tribe of Benjamin came notice in verse 16 of first chronicles twelve would just read it here are the children of Benjamin and Judah that came to the hold on Don and on to David and David went out to meet them and answered and said if you become peaceably unto me to help me thine heart shall be knit a mine heart shall be knit unto you but if you become too betrayed me to mine enemies seeing there is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it then the spirit came upon a micelle who was the chief of the captains and said thine are we David and on thy side thou son of Jesse see they recognized God was operating in David's life they were able to recognize the presence of God about David's life peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy God help us V then David received them and made them captains of the band remember said in endtime seed sign he says we need one another right now more than we ever did in all the history of the world is right now real royal believers we need each other if a thought comes and says I don't need I don't need somebody else right there that already is contrary to the word God already preached it has last Thursday sermon I am my brother's keeper and let me just be mindful if you think you're a little bit better than a brother or sister your prayers are not even being heard for the brothers sister that you're praying for they've been the only way you have access to the throne of grace you must come with Grace in your heart hello women real royal believers Laura meter God we need each other hey ma'am the armor bearer said go on up Jonathan I'm with thee all that's in your heart I'm right there with you well that armor bear had to be in touch with God too it couldn't just be Jonathan Dharma bear had to be in touch with God for the armor bearer all of a sudden to recognize Jonathan didn't have a Bible study with him nothing wrong with a Bible study but it didn't have to give him all the scriptures of what I'm quoting from tonight it's that moment that they knew God and God was moving through their lives they had discernment for the moment that's what we must have that's what we need is discernment of the Holy Spirit you realize you're blessed to be able to sit in the services and be able to hear God speaking to you you're blessed friends because many people that has as a day gone by the only time they can hear God is when they put on a tape I'm telling you that is backslidden you don't know god you've got to know him in the power of his resurrection his voice is still the same today as it was yesterday I'm glad God didn't leave us to our own devices are you with me we're not just gathered here has a group of people just to make sure that we're finishing this right and you got this scripture right we're not here for that you can go to school for that amen were here to hear from God and then believing that God knows what I have need of [Applause] and that will tell you God speaks to me when I listen to the message God speaks to me when I read the Bible as a matter of fact I fell more in love with my Bible you with me Oh God would be to God you see it depends on how you're approaching the water yeah you're with me amen now notice this you see God I want you to think of this if I can just kind of uh drop this in God he he desires unity because where there is no unity he can't move but remember all he needs is one that's surrendered that one that surrendered then God can work through that heart to call others into that same place of surrender right before the Holy Ghost ever came on the day of Pentecost they were in one mind and one Accord is that right you see it had brought them into that place of the unity now I'll say it like this it's not a unity of man a unity of man looks at it and it looks across like on a night like tonight and then let's say you know here I don't know how many many we have here let's say you know maybe we have 35 or 40 people here tonight and then you can look at it and then you think my we've got 40 people here tonight but you know Sunday Sunday we mind you know a half double that amount God is not interested neither does he need numbers to move all God needs is hearts that are surrendered in his pen now the enemy will do all he can to try to break unity everything that's why Paul would open in Ephesians four and tell us endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit which is the bond of peace amen it's war to keep that unity so we see that it's not just unity we're among a group of people but it is hearts that are united with Christ then Christ he is the strength of the church then the strength of the church in hearts that are united with him and United together what is it it allows God to make his word manifest you see a person might say well you know I I want to see my family I want to see this but if you just let your heart be make sure your heart your life is united to God you might say well I haven't seen nothing in this one's attacked won't put a time limit on it but you need listen to me now you need to stand like Jonathan stood and you need to claim what God has given you when it came time for Israel to cross over into the land remember there was some who were given inheritance on this side and God spoke through Joshua and he says remember Moses said were to go fight together so when we come here you Passover with us fight the enemies in the land then you can go back to your inheritance oh now we could just really preach on that you see God is called that this would be a victory that would be a victory by the body now I want you to watch this here in Psalms 44 verse 1 we have heard with our ears Oh God our fathers have told us what work Val dentist in their days in the times of all how thou did drive out the heathen with the hand and plant them and how thou did us the flick and cast them out who did it God for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them you mean they weren't swinging the sword that's not what he said it was not their marksmanship that won the battle it was because the Lord was on their side neither did their own arms save them but my right hand notice that right hand and 9 arm and the light of thy countenance because thou had us favor unto them thou art mighty no God here's the king of Israel saying thou art my king you see God had come back in position with David's life coming back into a place of authority thou art my king Oh God command deliverances for Jacob through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name we will tread them under that rise up against us for I will not trust in my bow that we're both it actually deals with the strength neither shall my sword save me but thou have saved us from our enemies and has put them to shame that hated us in God we boast all the day long and praise thy name forever amen somebody say help me to talk that kind of talk let me make my boast in God all the day long amen let's draw here to a place in the scripture here tonight in second Corinthians second chronicles chapter 14 verse 9 another place I want you to look here in the scripture here we find a say so the king they're in Judah I want to just move to verse nine here just skip a little bit you find that amongst within Israel they never come to a place where they could just sit around and just relax but they had to be on guard they had to be building themselves up they had to make ready during times of rest because one thing was sure battle was coming it's kind of like women you know the nighttime the mesquita start up by the time you know the morning when you walk around in your plants you're not battling with mosquitoes but if you stick around they'll be here in the evening again y'all know what I'm saying that's the same way it is with the devil that's how it is when you find it when you look in the scriptures about the Philistines about the malachite if you read in the scripture many times it seems like my they smote all the malachite and you think my they're wiped off and then you think here they are a few chapters later they dealt with all the malachite that was press and then just like God calls us in our life to deal with things in our life right then and there then you find here comes a battle a chapter or two later but what's this how it comes out there came against them it came against I came against here against Judah there came on against them Zahra the Ethiopian with a host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came to Marissa then ASA went out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zefa at the Marissa and ASA cried unto the Lord his God and said Lord it is nothing with thee to help weather with many or with them that have no power amen he knew about this come on somebody you see these are these what we're reading here these are lives that are in touch with God then they know that he given power to the faint amen to glows Isaiah 40 that have no strength he increases their strength you see they're standing on the promises of God oh I hope we catch you tonight as it's coming amen you think about that the prophets of old brother man fills in some spiritual food and be seasoned he said those those profits so lived in the presence of God he said till they spoke as God I'm telling you he spoke that in spiritual food a new season and he did not type Elijah in that message as the messenger he typed Elijah as the Church of the Living God in the last days that has a place that they can hide away and eat that stored up food him and God's got Ravens he's got servants to deliver it hallelujah Amen here you see it's not about you and I hope you're with me tonight it's not about you and I remember eysan in memorizing this and memorizing that it's just lay in the word and let our character and I ride so become him to where when we speak we speak as God hallelujah don't glory be to God Lord it's nothing with me to help with whether with many or with them that have no power help us O Lord our God for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude Oh Lord thou art our God let not man prevail against thee hasten ooh there's no restraint with God he can save by many he can say by few it doesn't matter but it has to be him to do the saving if he has many they got to be yielded to him if he has for you all they have to me as yielded to him it's him that does the saving they're right I want you just to think of this here you know when you we look at numbers there's another place in the scripture second chronicles chapter 25 there's a man by the name of Marcia he's a king of Judah he gathers Judah together in verse five and he prepares them for war there to go and there to fight against against these people of Seir which is Edom they're gonna be fighting against Eden but I want you to notice he gathers all of Judah together here is Judah coming in order in verse six he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver remember the kingdoms are split here's Judah here's Israel and here this shows the humanity and about us he's got something that needs to be done and what he's looking at his numbers but he's forgetting God never brought victory to Israel because of how many people they were God don't work that way it's about lives that are surrendered so here you find he purchases some mighty men of valor from that of Israel hmm but you see notice there came a man of God in verse 7 and a king o king let not the army of Israel go with thee for the Lord is not with Israel to wit with all the children of Ephraim you see even though this was of Israel but they were given to idols and here a man of God was able to say don't don't bring them in to fight with you because the Lord is not with them I believe God's making a statement here he's letting us know what's important is it must be the Lord that is with us I don't care how good a person can preach sing and how good they might look on the outside come on somebody I don't care if they fit the checklist of what you say this is a checklist message believer but you gotta look beyond the outside let's look to the inside it doesn't matter friends you understand it's about what is the substance that's on the inside is it a substance that God is with them I'd rather be standing there shoulder to shoulder with a brother he may not know his ABCs he may not maybe be verse and maybe have a deal with a demon but he stands there with faith in his heart and he knows that God his steel God and God still is he speaks through his vessels I'd rather stand shoulder-to-shoulder with somebody like that than somebody that can quote all the quotes I quote all the scriptures but can't hear God speak or glow to be to God God can do more with a few than he can with many but if that will go go do it be strong for the battle God shall make thee fall before the enemy for God hath power to help and to cast down you see what God lets him know it's your choice you want to take these hired mercenaries go ahead but I was want you to know it's in my power to either cast down your enemy or for you to fall it's in my power how glory God is calling their attention here and a mazda said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i've given to the army of Israel I'm thinking about his money now what shall I do with all of this that I've given and the man of God answered the Lord is able to give thee much more than this whoa I mean he's already out a hundred talents among those men but you see obedience is better than sacrifice but he would not only reap and to gain because look that money that he spent on them guys they wasn't going to perform but here God said look we don't need your money I just need your heart to believe that I can still move Oh glory and the Bible says you know when he told him verse 10 go home they were angered they were angered oh they were anger against Judah in verse 11 Amasya strengthened himself and he led forth the people went to the valley of salt and they smote the children of Seir ten thousand another ten thousand left there live in the children of Judah they carried him away captive and then they they smote them I don't want to just I just want to go to this place now you come down here let's come down to is Ezra chapter 8 verse 21 here is Ezra with much Treasury he's got a lot that they've been given from the king but take back in Jerusalem remember they've been exiled exiled into Babylon now the captivity the release here is as you are coming forth the foundation of the has already been laid the temple all of that is in place now it's to come and bring back the Treasury of the temple and Ezra he comes to a place after leaving from the Kings house and he proclaims a fast there at the river of hover that we might afflict ourselves before our God to seek Him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance in other words what do I do in this situation for I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek Him what a promise the hand of God remember he was at the hand of God that he quipped them to get the land it's the hand of God upon our lives his strength his power the hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him so we fast and besought our God for this and he was entreated of us still doubt in our lives you come we come to place and we need to know what's the will of God what's the will of God but you come to this point here Ezra he was tempted to go back and say hey can we have an escort all of the Treasury that we have can we have horsemen can we have protection but he says after what I testified I can't go back on what was spoken I can't go back so he stands there and God comes and makes known to him take the Treasury divided among the priests and have them go to Jerusalem and it all come back together at Jerusalem the Bible says they did not lose one bit of the Treasury it all came to Jerusalem it was with one heart one motive one purpose one objective amen and they arrived at the right place if you look in your Bible let's just look here just at the end of this chapter we read in 1st samuel 14 verse 23 here's the end result of what we were looking at so the Lord saved Israel that day and the battle passed over unto Beth Haven God saved him that day because of one man surrendered in the hand of God by the name of Jonathan and his armor-bearer that said I'm with you do all that's in your heart they went up together and God moved on their behalf and they smoked 20 men against let me tell you as a son and daughter of God the Spirit of God inside of your life and as a son and daughter of God it's no match you're more than a match for the enemy because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world amen our heart United with God's heart let your confession always be positive amen you find that as you lay in the word you lay in God's presence you talk black God talks Haven and this is where if God be for us who can be against us if God be for us who can be against us Amen you love him tonight there's no restraint with the Lord Amen let's pray Lord Jesus or how we just want to say that we love you
