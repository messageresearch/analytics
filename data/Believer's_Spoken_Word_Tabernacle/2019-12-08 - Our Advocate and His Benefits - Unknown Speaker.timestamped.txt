[21:03] things bounce today his sister Chrissy
[21:19] Carper's birthday okay so years ago my
[21:37] my son was diagnosed with cherub ism
[21:40] which is a very rare condition where
[21:43] tumors grow within his face the Lord
[21:46] healed him of that five years ago but
[21:48] The Devil's trying to work with me again
[21:51] they found tumors underneath his eyes
[21:54] and they're actually causing his Ida to
[21:57] protrude and to look upward and a few
[22:00] months ago they found out and he's got
[22:03] to go through another procedure to have
[22:04] the tumors removed so they're planning
[22:07] three surgeries on one day just before
[22:11] Christmas and I made me concerned of
[22:15] course fear sets in and he almost died
[22:18] the first time he had surgery so of
[22:20] course I have a lot of fears for him
[22:23] going into surgery again so I asked for
[22:27] prayer he had an appointment on Monday
[22:30] and I didn't know what to ask I just
[22:32] knew that the Lord knew whatever I was
[22:35] afraid of that he would solve so the the
[22:40] doctor said that the first surgery is
[22:42] going to be easy and it was my biggest
[22:44] concern removing the tumors out of his
[22:46] eyes but they said that they're
[22:47] estimating about an hour and the second
[22:51] surgery they're they're preparing him
[22:52] for braces and they said that's going to
[22:55] be a more complicated surgery but it's
[22:56] still an easy surgery they said and the
[22:59] third one is very simple they said his
[23:01] recovery time is only one week they said
[23:04] in a week that he'll be able to eat
[23:06] regular food and enjoy Christmas with

[38:01] amen
[38:02] oh how wonderful it is to serve the Lord
[38:04] amen it's a wonderful it's such a
[38:07] wonderful reality and a privilege if you
[38:09] don't know that this morning may your
[38:11] heart just yielded to God to know him in
[38:14] the power of his resurrection amen
[38:18] aren't you glad to be a Christian amen
[38:21] I'm so thankful for God's mercy this
[38:23] morning I want to remind you as we get
[38:26] ready to go into the word I think we
[38:28] have the mission offering this morning
[38:30] if the brothers will come to take that
[38:32] up we also have a couple requests that I
[38:36] want to pray over here this morning one
[38:39] where sister Linda my Aunt Linda had
[38:42] asked requested for a prayer cloth
[38:44] you've heard the prayer request that's
[38:46] been offered up there and as you've been
[38:48] been praying over that and even this
[38:50] morning we just were just looking to the
[38:53] Lord that God will move on the scene to
[38:56] know that God's already working and
[38:58] whatever Avenue that God chooses this is
[39:02] not this is not what we determine it's
[39:05] whatever Avenue God chooses even how
[39:08] brother branham would tell us by the
[39:10] Spirit of God he said God performs
[39:12] miracles through doctors surgeries and
[39:15] medicine and we know that even through
[39:18] the Scriptures there were things within
[39:19] that and yet there's times to how that
[39:22] God it just it all all healing comes
[39:25] from the Lord God can perform a miracle
[39:28] so it's all in the hands of God no
[39:31] matter what way what we're standing on
[39:33] is the Word of God that says by my
[39:37] stripes who you are healed that's where
[39:40] we're standing our prayer is not with
[39:43] the formation of this as how it has to
[39:45] be our prayer is this is what he said we
[39:48] stand here that settles it right there
[39:51] amen so we want to just remember her in
[39:53] prayer as we pray over the the prayer
[39:56] cloth here also had a request come in
[39:58] from a couple that's here this morning
[40:01] they had a special request that we did
[40:04] not get in the to bring as the when we
[40:08] were reading prayer requests this
[40:09] morning but this request it deals with
[40:12] remembering that one on one of their
[40:14] family members in prayer that their sins
[40:17] would be forgiven the reality is their
[40:20] sins are already forgiven they have to
[40:23] acknowledge what Jesus Christ already
[40:25] did for them Amen so that's what we want
[40:29] to pray is that God would bring that
[40:31] reality to them then they move within
[40:33] repentance to accept what he's already
[40:36] done so we want to pray for that for
[40:39] that situation as well and even as we we
[40:42] lift the the mission offering here this
[40:44] morning could we all just go together in
[40:46] prayer let's join together as a body of
[40:49] believers here this morning Heavenly
[40:51] Father Lord as we come here Lord and we
[40:55] have Lord assembled Lord under the
[40:58] unction of the Holy Ghost Lord to know
[41:00] that it is your word that draws us that
[41:04] we would assemble ourselves together we
[41:07] Lord our desiring Lord to see you Lord
[41:12] come through your word and speak to our
[41:14] hearts Lord you see the needs that are
[41:17] here before us Lord
[41:19] you see those requests that's went up
[41:21] Lord God here this morning the spoken
[41:24] and the unspoken alike Lord there are
[41:27] many needs Lord God throughout this
[41:30] assembly alone Lord if it was even just
[41:33] one need there that is more than what
[41:36] anybody can ever take care of but
[41:38] nothing is too hard for you Lord and so
[41:42] father every one of these requests Lord
[41:44] is we have Lord continued to lift Lord
[41:47] Lilliana before the throne of God and
[41:50] Lord we know that it is Lord your will
[41:54] Lord as we prayed your God that father
[41:57] you are the Lord that he loved all our
[42:00] diseases and Lord we stand upon that
[42:02] word it's your desire Lord Lord that we
[42:05] would be whole and so father as we take
[42:09] this prayer cloth Lord I have it in my
[42:11] hand the brothers and sisters Lord
[42:14] throughout this congregation Lord our
[42:16] hearts are united together Lord under
[42:19] the shed blood by the Holy Ghost and
[42:21] Lord God our faith Lord God is set forth
[42:24] that when this prayer cloth Lord would
[42:27] be placed Lord upon our sister Linda
[42:29] Lord I ask your God that the same
[42:31] creative power of Almighty God that move
[42:34] Lord God to bring about a change in a
[42:37] life Lord God that lifts a life Lord
[42:39] from the muck of sin and despair and
[42:42] brings about a daughter of God a son of
[42:45] God I ask Lord God right now father that
[42:48] that same creative power of God would
[42:50] move Lord God as it moved in Genesis 1
[42:53] Lord that father for the needs in her
[42:55] body
[42:56] Lord we by faith Lord like David
[42:59] swinging Lord that slingshot Lord it was
[43:03] not David's accuracy it was his faith in
[43:06] the Living God that took the stone Lord
[43:09] to the forehead of the giant his
[43:11] accuracy was standing upon the saith the
[43:14] Lord and father were standing here Lord
[43:17] this morning as you're believing
[43:19] children Lord and dear God were asking
[43:22] for every one of these requests Lord not
[43:24] just for sister Linda but Lord for the
[43:27] request of that family member of the
[43:29] young couple that's here this morning
[43:31] Lord that that family member would come
[43:34] to the realization Lord God that their
[43:37] sin that has already been paid for Lord
[43:40] that you've already borne their sins
[43:43] away Lord I ask God that that reality
[43:46] would break upon their heart and they
[43:48] themselves would come to repentance Lord
[43:51] and to accept what you have already done
[43:54] Lord and that you will do a full work in
[43:56] that life Oh God
[43:58] Lord you can take the Lord what is
[44:00] covered in darkness and when light comes
[44:04] Lord the darkness must flee and so
[44:07] father we ask these things now even as

[44:12] God we ask that you and anoint our eyes
[44:15] Lord our hearts Lord anoint our ears

[44:31] pray that you'll take it Lord with your
[44:33] hands and multiply for in your hands

[47:16] keep that in mind as well let's just
[47:19] we'll start reading here and then I
[47:21] won't keep you standing I'll read the
[47:23] rest of it when you get seated but verse
[47:25] one a psalm of David Psalm 103 sorry
[47:29] Psalms 103 psalm of David bless the Lord
[47:33] O my soul and all that is within me
[47:39] bless His Holy Name every one of these
[47:43] scriptures we could just preach for a
[47:46] long time all that is within me not just
[47:53] a part of me but all that is within me
[47:56] bless the Lord all my soul and forget
[48:00] not all his benefits who forgiveth all
[48:06] thine iniquities who healeth all thy
[48:10] diseases look at somebody and say all
[48:16] tell-tell the other neighbor all well
[48:20] your awakened that's good who redeemeth
[48:23] who redeemeth well anything gets
[48:28] redeemed because it belongs to that
[48:30] person who redeemeth thy life from
[48:34] destruction
[48:36] he don't just do that one time he keeps
[48:39] on doing it are you with me he redeems
[48:43] our soul and then time and time again as
[48:47] we come through tests and through trials
[48:50] he redeems us how many times were Paul
[48:53] said we had the sentence of death he
[48:55] said he delivered us and he will deliver
[48:58] us amen who redeemeth thy life from
[49:02] destruction who crowns thee with
[49:05] lovingkindness and tender mercies who
[49:10] satisfies thy mouth with good things so
[49:18] that value--the is renewed like the
[49:21] Eagles how many know sometimes here is
[49:25] this is not just where the Lord Jesus
[49:27] just dropping things here and there but
[49:30] an eagle when it gets down then other
[49:34] Eagles come to it and they take the meat
[49:36] and put the meat the meat in their beak
[49:39] he satisfied thy mouth with good things
[49:44] amen this is personal he comes
[49:47] personally to us and delivers to us his
[49:50] word to our hearts so that thy youth oh
[49:54] this is the power of the word so that
[49:56] thy youth is renewed like the Eagles
[49:59] amen god bless you as you're being
[50:02] seated bless his word let's just keep on
[50:04] reading the Bible says in verse 6 the
[50:08] Lord executed righteousness and judgment
[50:13] for all that are oppressed
[50:16] he made known his ways unto Moses his
[50:20] acts unto the children of Israel the
[50:23] Lord
[50:24] is merciful and gracious slow to anger
[50:31] and plenteous in mercy he will not
[50:36] always chide neither will he keep his
[50:40] anger forever he hath not dealt with us
[50:44] after our sins nor rewarded US according
[50:49] to our iniquities aren't you glad for as
[50:53] the heaven is high above the earth so
[50:57] great is the mercy of his mercy toward
[51:01] them that fear him as far as the east is
[51:05] from the west so far hath he removed our
[51:09] transgressions from us like as a father
[51:14] pitieth his children that word pitty
[51:18] affero means to be compassion we
[51:21] compassionate have tender affection like
[51:24] as a father pity of his children so the
[51:27] Lord pities of them that fear him for he
[51:31] knoweth verse 14 for he knoweth our
[51:34] frame he remembereth that we are dust
[51:40] now we know he doesn't withhold
[51:43] admonition and correction but rather
[51:47] with his understanding he approaches us
[51:51] he doesn't I want you to catch this he
[51:54] doesn't discourage us when he corrects
[51:58] us to the place as though we are nothing
[52:01] he knows the measure that is needed so
[52:06] that we are able to continue I want you
[52:10] to think of this year as for man his
[52:13] days are as grass as a flower of the
[52:17] field so he flourishes for the wind
[52:20] passes over it and is gone and the place
[52:23] thereof shall know it no more but the
[52:26] mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to
[52:29] everlasting upon them that fear him now
[52:33] we understand that this fear is not a
[52:36] slavish
[52:38] fear that's the wrong kind of fear but
[52:42] fear the fear of the Lord the Bible says
[52:45] that's the beginning of wisdom is the
[52:50] fear of the Lord and the fear of the
[52:52] Lord is the reverence of the Lord
[52:56] it's the reverence of his word the
[52:59] reverence of his presence it's
[53:01] referencing him upon them that fear him
[53:05] and his righteousness unto children's
[53:08] children to such as keep his covenant
[53:11] and to those that remember his
[53:14] Commandments to do them now I want to
[53:17] just read another part of scripture just
[53:19] laying some things in here as a
[53:20] background going right back into a
[53:22] scripture we've been looking at in 1st
[53:25] John chapter 2 verse 1 now here John
[53:28] writes my little children these things
[53:30] write I unto you that ye sin not and if
[53:35] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[53:39] father Jesus Christ the righteous and he
[53:44] is the propitiation for our sins and not
[53:48] for ours only but also for the sins of
[53:52] the whole world now to think of that
[53:57] when we go back if I just take you just
[54:00] for a moment and take you back that it
[54:02] is always been the place where
[54:07] fellowship is between God and his family
[54:12] is under the blood when the fall
[54:16] happened in in in in Eden remember God
[54:21] Himself they came out with the fig
[54:23] leaves on and as they hadn't they made
[54:26] themselves aprons and they covered
[54:30] themselves and yet within the presence
[54:33] of God not to think of this they did not
[54:37] even have confidence in what they were
[54:39] wearing to even come out in God's
[54:42] presence and yet God knowing that that
[54:46] their confidence here it doesn't matter
[54:48] what they were
[54:49] what it was that they had clothed
[54:51] themselves because a religion is a
[54:54] covering it did not allow them to come
[54:56] out into the presence of God and yet
[54:59] that is what they were made to live in
[55:03] God's presence I mean what parent would
[55:07] want his children when he speaks that
[55:09] they would run and hide there is no
[55:12] parent that would think that to be
[55:14] glorious but the glory of that of the
[55:17] parent is that when the parent would
[55:19] speak that the children themselves they
[55:22] would want to be in the presence of
[55:24] their parent or parents they would want
[55:28] to be in the presence as we look at his
[55:30] sons and daughters of God we would want
[55:32] to be in the presence of Almighty God
[55:35] David would write of this of how that
[55:37] you know it would be the desire of his
[55:40] life to let me then I would dwell in the
[55:44] house of the Lord forever then this is
[55:47] where I would abide in the presence of
[55:50] God now when we think of this how God
[55:53] then he he he the Bible says he slave he
[55:57] took the clothing of an innocent one and
[56:00] he throw that clothing in there to Adam
[56:02] and Eve because what they had on they
[56:05] were not fit to stand in his sight but
[56:08] God took that of an innocent one that
[56:11] clothing of animal life and he gave them
[56:14] the garments that they needed in order
[56:17] for them to be able to stand in his
[56:19] sight because God is determined to have
[56:22] fellowship with his family so there's
[56:26] only one that can provide the right
[56:28] necessary condition for that of
[56:31] fellowship to be or fellowship to be
[56:34] restored and that is by God himself
[56:37] making the provision that you and I can
[56:41] stand in his presence and so when we
[56:43] think of this it's always been the blood
[56:46] all the way through the scriptures
[56:49] there's many of the types we see in the
[56:51] Old Testament but one of the types that
[56:53] we pull up is that of we're in in Exodus
[56:57] 12 remember when God sends
[57:00] an exodus message down there by the way
[57:03] of Moses and and to think of it Moses
[57:06] you know well let's just go on Moses he
[57:09] went down there with an exodus message
[57:11] there and he would begin to minister to
[57:13] the children of Israel that the God who
[57:16] made the promise I've met that God and
[57:19] that God is alive and well and listen to
[57:23] me
[57:23] he didn't leave that presence back at
[57:25] the burning bush the God who made
[57:27] himself known in that burning bush he
[57:30] came inside of Moses he was not left
[57:33] back there in the desert
[57:34] he got companied his prophet with a
[57:37] message because the message is not words
[57:40] the message is Christ it is a living
[57:43] promise of God that's become a reality
[57:46] and God takes upon flesh and God goes
[57:49] down there begins to speak because a
[57:51] man's word cannot create there's only
[57:54] one that can create and that is Almighty
[57:57] God when God speaks there are there is
[58:01] creation that comes forth it was not
[58:04] Moses ingenuity nor was it Moses the man
[58:08] that created the Flies and all those
[58:10] things but it was yielding there to the
[58:13] Living God who had told Moses here than
[58:16] that meant to live there under that shed
[58:18] blood of those offerings and to think of
[58:20] how that Moses had confidence in what
[58:23] God had gave to him in the shed blood
[58:26] that Moses could stand there under the
[58:28] shed blood and what God would ask of him
[58:31] to do he did not flinch nor pull back
[58:33] what was it
[58:34] it shows that there is power in that
[58:38] blood to bring a confidence of who we
[58:40] are as sons and daughters of God brother
[58:43] sister we don't got to take a backseat
[58:45] to no devil to no condition no sir
[58:49] we are ordained as sons and daughters of
[58:51] God I just say it personally like this
[58:53] you have not been called or made to be
[58:56] the tail you have been called to be the
[58:58] head
[58:59] given by God's grace to be a master over
[59:02] every circumstance you say brother
[59:04] sender that sounds way out into the
[59:07] carnal mind in ears to our minds
[59:09] naturally it does not seem possible here
[59:13] but something down there says I know
[59:15] what is possible what is it it's God
[59:19] working through a direct conduit with
[59:22] his children to where your act and stand
[59:24] with authority under the Word of God
[59:27] brother there is nothing that gives you
[59:29] an hour authority lack the revelation of
[59:33] Jesus Christ that comes through the
[59:35] works nothing gives us authority like
[59:38] that
[59:39] no mother here they come under in that
[59:43] Exodus message mind and then within that
[59:47] in order for them to come out of Egypt
[59:50] they've got to come out with blood and
[59:54] God makes known in exodus 12 take the
[59:58] lamb take the lamb for every household
[1:00:01] you took heal that lamb inspect it
[1:00:04] you're to kill it you'd apply the blood
[1:00:06] and to know when they walked out they
[1:00:08] were to stay there under the blood until
[1:00:12] mark to eat that and we're with the
[1:00:15] atonement was made that we're in that
[1:00:19] they could walk out of Egypt so they
[1:00:21] were now walking out remember the blood
[1:00:24] was applied as we as we said some weeks
[1:00:27] ago it was applied here above the door
[1:00:30] it wasn't it it's departed you can't you
[1:00:34] can't despise the blood and then think
[1:00:36] you're going to get by but notice you to
[1:00:39] come under that blood it was blood that
[1:00:42] was on the side blood that was over
[1:00:44] showing it was a type of showing that
[1:00:47] what God would do through him by the
[1:00:50] Holy Ghost coming up on the believer but
[1:00:54] repented one and Ana here God would so
[1:00:57] move by a divine work and bring them
[1:01:00] under that blood so much so that God
[1:01:03] would say when I pass through
[1:01:06] the land of Egypt to smite and execute
[1:01:09] judgment it said I will not look upon
[1:01:11] you why he can't see when the blood has
[1:01:14] been applied all he sees is the blood
[1:01:17] you see the blood has been applied by
[1:01:20] faith so they are under the blood now
[1:01:24] think of this in their journey when they
[1:01:26] came out they they they they they got
[1:01:29] hungry he fed on it they got thirsty
[1:01:33] he gave them drink they ran into even in
[1:01:38] times of their failures and notice even
[1:01:41] when it came to where in the scriptures
[1:01:44] where Balak would want to persuade
[1:01:47] Balaam that you can curse these people
[1:01:51] and he began to show them the honda
[1:01:53] parts of that of israel he began to show
[1:01:56] him all of their shortcomings in all
[1:01:59] those places like that but you know no
[1:02:02] matter what that that Balak could show
[1:02:04] Balaam
[1:02:05] Balaam himself remember how God how the
[1:02:08] Lord comes there upon Balaam and the
[1:02:11] prophecy that comes forth that that God
[1:02:13] has not found no such thing within Jacob
[1:02:17] how can that be how can it be when there
[1:02:21] was a group of people they were filled
[1:02:23] with faults and failures how can that be
[1:02:27] because they were under the blood I want
[1:02:32] you just to follow me here as we apply
[1:02:34] that God would not honor them and
[1:02:36] brother Brown would say like this he
[1:02:38] says God didn't have honor for them but
[1:02:42] he had honor for his atonement he was
[1:02:46] looking at his atonement rather if he'd
[1:02:50] have been looking at Israel he'd have
[1:02:52] killed every one of them but there had
[1:02:55] to be a blood that would stand for them
[1:02:58] and he would look at
[1:03:00] blood amen hallelujah this is why under
[1:03:07] the blood blue room says under the blood
[1:03:10] it all looks sons and daughters to give
[1:03:13] it all looks sons and daughters to him
[1:03:16] as long as they're confessed under the
[1:03:18] blood so if you've done wrong get under
[1:03:20] the blood today and confess your sins
[1:03:23] for if we fall from grace we have an
[1:03:25] advocate to the Father
[1:03:27] through our Lord Jesus Christ oh if it
[1:03:30] wasn't for that advocate we'd all be
[1:03:33] gone but in there notice in there were
[1:03:38] brought under the rich royal blood of
[1:03:43] the Son of God and before God we are
[1:03:47] pure and holy brought in under the rich
[1:03:53] royal blood of the Son of God and in
[1:03:57] there not outside of there in there we
[1:04:01] are pure and holy now think of this
[1:04:06] there you know when we think of thee or
[1:04:12] even around this earth right now because
[1:04:15] the Bible says what we read here that
[1:04:18] that he is the propitiation for our sins
[1:04:19] and not for ours only but also for the
[1:04:23] sins of the whole world to know that
[1:04:25] there is the bumper of blood that is
[1:04:29] there around this whole earth while God
[1:04:32] himself if the Holy Spirit is still
[1:04:35] mooing and drawing hearts to that place
[1:04:39] of repentance and redemption he is
[1:04:42] working within that time that notice if
[1:04:45] it was not for the bumper of blood that
[1:04:48] is their brother Brad would say it like
[1:04:49] this he said when I do wrong it does not
[1:04:52] go to God he said what happens is it
[1:04:55] goes to that bumper of blood of the Lord
[1:04:59] Jesus he said God does not see my wrong
[1:05:02] now think of it listen to me now
[1:05:05] even when you and I were yet sinners
[1:05:08] and we were there within the world we
[1:05:11] needed listen we needed to know that we
[1:05:14] have been redeemed because in reality is
[1:05:18] somebody could have told us you're
[1:05:19] redeemed we could have said I'm redeemed
[1:05:21] and there is a power when it is believed
[1:05:24] and it's confessed
[1:05:25] however for someone just to say I'm
[1:05:27] redeemed and they continue to live the
[1:05:30] same life it shows that redemption of
[1:05:32] what was done for them it's really not
[1:05:35] become personal they're only saying
[1:05:38] something they know by acknowledge
[1:05:39] instead of knowing it by personal
[1:05:42] experience there is no substitute for a
[1:05:46] trip to Calvary no substitute at all
[1:05:49] every every individual must make a
[1:05:53] personal trip to Calvary where that the
[1:05:57] debt was settled the payment was made
[1:06:00] and must have within it but same
[1:06:04] resurrection power that came to confirm
[1:06:08] that I have accepted that sacrifice and
[1:06:11] you are accepted in it then you've got
[1:06:15] pardoning power brother pardoning power
[1:06:18] brings faith for you to walk right in
[1:06:21] the face of the devil and say you're not
[1:06:23] afraid of me but you're afraid of who I
[1:06:26] represent
[1:06:27] because you know where you're standing
[1:06:29] you're standing under the blood he
[1:06:36] doesn't I think this is very he doesn't
[1:06:39] see us as sinners he sees us as sons and
[1:06:44] daughters of God now you know brother
[1:06:47] Branham he he placed it like this I read
[1:06:50] to you the interview of sister Bruce
[1:06:52] that took place right before brother
[1:06:56] Branham preaches the masterpiece he's
[1:06:58] meeting with her in the back room right
[1:07:00] before he preaches that message and
[1:07:02] brother Branham right in the middle of
[1:07:04] preaching the message the masterpiece he
[1:07:06] goes into talking about how God is
[1:07:09] building that masterpiece and he says
[1:07:11] you know he said the only way he said
[1:07:15] that it it could be for you and I is
[1:07:17] that God the great sculptor he's seen
[1:07:20] that man
[1:07:21] not keep a covenant he just can't do it
[1:07:24] there is no way at all
[1:07:26] no man can not keep the Covenant man can
[1:07:29] not keep the word but it takes a word
[1:07:32] himself inside of you and me to keep his
[1:07:35] own word hallelujah OMA on an interview
[1:07:41] brother brems said I was talking to a a
[1:07:43] person that's present now and said
[1:07:44] brother Branham I have so many thing I
[1:07:46] know that's wrong a godly little woman
[1:07:48] but I said look sister you don't look at
[1:07:51] yourself it's just what your desire is
[1:07:55] and what you try to do and if you really
[1:07:59] love the Lord
[1:08:00] I can't shout that one loud enough if
[1:08:03] you really love the Lord
[1:08:06] you tried to serve him with all your
[1:08:11] heart and then all your mistakes is hid
[1:08:16] in the blood of the Lord Jesus see he
[1:08:19] made a way what's he looking at the
[1:08:24] desire of your heart he knew that in our
[1:08:29] lives the seed that he had sown he knew
[1:08:32] the desire was we wanted to serve Him
[1:08:35] but you and I could not make that
[1:08:38] possible that's why there had to be the
[1:08:41] quickening power of God only inside let
[1:08:44] me just preach for a few moments is that
[1:08:46] Alright well brother manna makes a
[1:08:48] statement in power transformation and he
[1:08:50] says the seed he said within that seed
[1:08:53] is the power for what he's spoken to
[1:08:57] become what he said it would be but you
[1:08:59] see that power it must work in unity
[1:09:03] with the quickening power of God so what
[1:09:06] is that power that's within the sea that
[1:09:09] is the power of submission and yielding
[1:09:12] to the quickening power that it's God's
[1:09:15] quickening power the life of the vine
[1:09:18] coming to produce what is in the
[1:09:21] branches is that Alright
[1:09:23] if we need the quickening power of God
[1:09:26] to release what is in the
[1:09:29] so to think of that he makes away he
[1:09:33] made away by the quickening power but
[1:09:36] what was there I want to serve him that
[1:09:38] it becomes a reality and you know what
[1:09:40] it's no longer you trying to do it its
[1:09:45] Christ in you doing it to a person
[1:09:49] outside the veil they look at that and
[1:09:51] say but I've gave this up I tried to
[1:09:53] stop this I tried to do that let me just
[1:09:56] tell you the whole problem you you and I
[1:10:00] that's the problem and they are not
[1:10:02] being me by being you
[1:10:04] it's your efforts I'm not in listen
[1:10:08] we're not I'm not against you I'm
[1:10:10] telling you you can't do it he has to do
[1:10:13] it but in him doing it it takes your
[1:10:16] heart lining up with the word and saying
[1:10:19] amen to the water because what happens
[1:10:22] is so many times that people come to a
[1:10:24] place and say well I'll do this and
[1:10:26] they're going up on their own strength
[1:10:28] but they never receive the strength of
[1:10:31] the Lord in their life and so after a
[1:10:34] period of time they turn loose when I'm
[1:10:36] talking to you this morning it's not
[1:10:38] where you've got a handle on it but
[1:10:40] where he's got a handle on you that's
[1:10:42] what I'm preaching about that's the real
[1:10:45] message that's the real gospel is where
[1:10:47] Christ has preeminence in your life if
[1:10:53] you really love the Lord
[1:10:54] now many people many people say they
[1:10:57] love God right but you tell you can see
[1:11:02] you can see actions if you really love
[1:11:06] the Lord you try to serve him with all
[1:11:09] your heart then all your mistakes is hid
[1:11:11] in the blood of the Lord Jesus he made a
[1:11:13] way now the Bible says in Hebrews 10
[1:11:16] verse 1 and verse 2 for the law having a
[1:11:20] shadow of good things to come and not
[1:11:21] the very image of the things can never
[1:11:23] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:11:26] year by year continually make the comers
[1:11:28] thereunto perfect for then would they
[1:11:32] not have ceased to be offered because
[1:11:34] that the worshipers once purged should
[1:11:38] have no more conscience this word
[1:11:40] desire of sin not to think of this here
[1:11:45] now when we look at remember what David
[1:11:48] would write David would write back in
[1:11:50] the Psalms and then Paul would pick it
[1:11:53] up in Romans 4 blessed is the man in
[1:11:57] whom the lord imputeth no sin is that
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:01] blessed is that man and notice this
[1:12:05] blessedness David was speaking about
[1:12:08] even though David himself could only
[1:12:10] know it in part under the sacrificial
[1:12:14] offering of that innocent animal life
[1:12:17] which was only spoken of perfect
[1:12:21] sacrifice that was to come and David
[1:12:24] would say blessed is the man and whom
[1:12:26] the Lord would not impute sin not to
[1:12:28] think of it brother Ram would pick that
[1:12:30] up and say not even sin is imputed to a
[1:12:33] genuine believer and he pulls the
[1:12:36] scripture I believe it's first John 5:7
[1:12:37] he that is born of God does not commit
[1:12:41] sin the word commit means practice are
[1:12:44] you with me he does not practice sin he
[1:12:48] cannot sin it's not even imputed blessed
[1:12:52] is the man in whom God will not impute
[1:12:53] sin when you're in Christ you have no
[1:12:58] desire to sin the worshiper once purged
[1:13:03] has no more conscious of sin you don't
[1:13:06] desire it now to the world you might be
[1:13:10] a sinner but to God you're not because
[1:13:13] you're in Christ how can you be it be in
[1:13:19] a sinner when you're in a sinless one
[1:13:24] that's the real key you can't be a
[1:13:27] sinner and be in Christ no sir
[1:13:33] can in better person make mistakes when
[1:13:36] they're in Christ yes but they are not
[1:13:38] as bandage in Christ because the blood
[1:13:41] of Jesus Christ does not bring about
[1:13:44] bondage
[1:13:48] mmm now think of this right here how he
[1:13:52] says you don't desire it now to the
[1:13:55] world you might be a sinner but to God
[1:13:59] you're not because you're in Christ how
[1:14:03] can you be a sinner when you're in the
[1:14:05] send us one and God only sees him who
[1:14:09] you are in this is the power of
[1:14:15] imputation this is where the very nature
[1:14:19] of God comes into our life and here that
[1:14:22] life I listen to me now that life being
[1:14:25] inside of us it ties us there into that
[1:14:28] sacrifice where this this old temple
[1:14:32] this temple in which that old man
[1:14:34] resided that old nature he is dead is no
[1:14:40] such thing as hanging him up he's dead
[1:14:43] that's why there's got to be a new man
[1:14:46] come on the inside that's why the Church
[1:14:49] of the Living God is not based on
[1:14:51] programs and self-help we can't do it on
[1:14:55] our own
[1:14:56] amen we need the power of the blood of
[1:15:00] the Lamb I believe in just as strong a
[1:15:05] man meets God face to face brother
[1:15:08] that man is sealed all the way to
[1:15:11] eternity you don't have to worry about
[1:15:14] it God they are in the hands of God God
[1:15:17] has controlled their life yes sir and
[1:15:25] notice this
[1:15:32] pardon me something something came up
[1:15:33] honey going there called it something
[1:15:36] just came up here about the security at
[1:15:37] home sorry I gotta get that off my mind
[1:15:41] is that Alright
[1:15:45] hebrews 10:14 now don't you all worry
[1:15:48] about it I got a big bad dog at home you
[1:15:54] look everybody to death I want you to
[1:16:02] look at this for by one offering he hath
[1:16:06] perfected forever them that are
[1:16:10] sanctified now watch what watch how this
[1:16:16] verse starts about one offering where's
[1:16:19] our focus on the offering the effects of
[1:16:22] that offering comes back upon the
[1:16:25] believer it's not our perfection it's
[1:16:29] God's perfection coming inside of us
[1:16:33] bringing us in under the blood
[1:16:38] are you with me this is live brother
[1:16:41] branham with telus he said don't ever in
[1:16:43] the hebrew series don't ever get focused
[1:16:45] on that this being the glorified body in
[1:16:48] this earth right now now watch where of
[1:16:53] the Holy Ghost also he is a witness to
[1:16:55] us for after that he had said before
[1:16:59] this is the Covenant that I will make
[1:17:02] with them after those days saith the
[1:17:05] Lord who's going to make this covenant
[1:17:07] god is that right this isn't well that's
[1:17:11] not God no God said I'll make this
[1:17:14] covenant I will put my laws into their
[1:17:18] hearts and in their minds will I write
[1:17:23] them glory well if he writes he's an
[1:17:30] author
[1:17:32] is that right and there's no greater
[1:17:35] privilege then when you get the author's
[1:17:37] book and they're at the book signing
[1:17:40] you're at the book signing there's no
[1:17:43] greater privilege than they had to have
[1:17:44] the person who wrote the book and it is
[1:17:47] a part of it for them to sign it let me
[1:17:49] tell you something you and I were always
[1:17:51] a part of the book the Bible says that
[1:17:54] our members in Psalms 139 our members
[1:17:57] were written in him yet being unperfect
[1:18:00] yet he saw then were we were always
[1:18:02] there in the Lamb's Book of Life but to
[1:18:05] notice the Spirit of God moves down upon
[1:18:08] our heart and what does he write upon
[1:18:10] our lives he's not writing thou shalt
[1:18:12] not do this now shalt not do this what
[1:18:15] does he write he writes by revealing his
[1:18:18] name by revealing his person because he
[1:18:24] himself is the lawgiver it is the very
[1:18:27] spirit of life and truth that makes us
[1:18:31] free from the law of sin and death or
[1:18:37] glory be to God no to think of this here
[1:18:40] and their sins and iniquities will I
[1:18:44] remember no more which I could preach on
[1:18:49] that aloud I will remember no more now
[1:18:52] where remission of these is there is no
[1:18:55] more offering for sin glory be to God
[1:19:04] but the banner would put it like this he
[1:19:06] says I myself I will come down speaking
[1:19:10] of the Lord Jesus into the world and
[1:19:12] take on human flesh I'll pay the penalty
[1:19:14] that's required here and I'll take the
[1:19:16] place I'll make them perfect because
[1:19:19] I'll bring them in me and I imperfect
[1:19:22] jesus said be you therefore perfect even
[1:19:25] as your father which is in heaven is
[1:19:27] perfect
[1:19:28] he said then here is that mangled body
[1:19:31] that was beaten and bruised for sin and
[1:19:33] every sin that the world ever had
[1:19:35] forever would had was laid upon him and
[1:19:38] he is the body of that jehovah raised up
[1:19:41] on the last day there on the third day
[1:19:43] after his death and if
[1:19:44] we are in that body we're just as
[1:19:48] perfect as the body is whoo this and a
[1:19:55] half I'm talking about your soul and
[1:19:58] remember that when if that spirit that
[1:20:02] raised up Christ from the dead it dwell
[1:20:05] in you it shall also quicken your mortal
[1:20:08] body equipment it to the word of promise
[1:20:13] in this hour that's what the quickening
[1:20:15] power did old man the quickening power
[1:20:18] when it came upon that dead lifeless
[1:20:21] body of the Lord Jesus what did that
[1:20:24] quickening power do it raised it up
[1:20:26] according to the promise
[1:20:28] so when he came forward it was the
[1:20:31] manifestation of the promise that was
[1:20:34] made concerning him and that's what the
[1:20:37] quickening power when it makes its way
[1:20:39] to the place in the life of the believer
[1:20:42] you're not trying to be a Christian but
[1:20:44] brother your life now steps out of the
[1:20:47] pages of the scripture and it reveals
[1:20:50] Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday
[1:20:53] today and forever that's what the
[1:20:56] quickening power does Oh hallelujah
[1:21:01] well he says they don't care what the
[1:21:05] world says or what anybody else says
[1:21:07] even what their family says they walk in
[1:21:11] the Spirit of God in perfect divine love
[1:21:16] now I don't mean their flip it I don't
[1:21:20] care what you say it's recognizing you
[1:21:22] let no other word but the Word of God
[1:21:25] have three minutes in your life are you
[1:21:29] with me but say no I had a lot of
[1:21:32] feeling about brother so-and-so that's
[1:21:34] aware be preeminent the Bible said cast
[1:21:37] down imaginations come on friends retain
[1:21:41] many times where people let stuff go
[1:21:43] because they don't check it with a word
[1:21:46] come on somebody I don't care how many
[1:21:49] feelings or how many bags are how many
[1:21:50] dish or how many back it's gotta be
[1:21:52] checked with the word
[1:21:54] and sometimes listen to me brother bran
[1:21:57] will tell us over and over he said you
[1:21:59] test every motive and an objective and
[1:22:02] brother when you test something you
[1:22:04] don't just run it through the lab you
[1:22:06] test it in prayer you test it you test
[1:22:10] it you test it because why it is
[1:22:13] necessary you don't want to have the
[1:22:15] wrong motive and objective
[1:22:20] Noorie how did you get into it well you
[1:22:28] get into it by believin brother Bram is
[1:22:31] a prophet know that you need to do that
[1:22:35] yep but but but but that didn't bring
[1:22:39] you in you got to be brought in by the
[1:22:41] same Holy Ghost is that right he meant
[1:22:46] by you well how do we get in the body
[1:22:48] well I believe it by you know coming to
[1:22:50] believer spoken words have enough no you
[1:22:51] can come right here and still be a devil
[1:22:53] oh jesus where am I going home for the
[1:22:58] same you know I'm friends listen the
[1:23:00] reality is there's only one place of
[1:23:03] safety and that's under the blood of the
[1:23:06] Lamb
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:11] but one spirit it's good to come to the
[1:23:14] house of God
[1:23:15] but we need to be under the blood by one
[1:23:18] spirit he says notice then he says it's
[1:23:20] not what I've done what I am who I was
[1:23:23] or nothing about it it's what God has
[1:23:25] done for me in Christ and we are
[1:23:28] perfected with our sacrifice he says he
[1:23:32] makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you
[1:23:35] in if he wasn't worthy I'm sure nobody
[1:23:40] in here feels worthy if you do you need
[1:23:43] prayer that pride Devils got a hold on
[1:23:46] you
[1:23:48] he knows your heart aren't you glad
[1:23:52] somebody knows your heart he knows what
[1:23:57] you are he knows your motives he knows
[1:24:00] what you are there are traps all along
[1:24:03] the road sure the devil will cause you
[1:24:07] to stumble and you say I didn't mean to
[1:24:10] do that
[1:24:11] God you know it he said you're still
[1:24:14] perfect because there's a perfect blood
[1:24:16] offered for you every day and a bleeding
[1:24:20] sacrificed hanging before the throne of
[1:24:23] Almighty God
[1:24:24] 1st Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye
[1:24:28] in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto
[1:24:31] us wisdom and righteousness and
[1:24:34] sanctification and redemption that
[1:24:37] according as it is written he that
[1:24:39] glorieth let him glory in the Lord in
[1:24:43] 2nd Corinthians 5:21 for he hath made
[1:24:46] him to be sin for us who knew no sin
[1:24:49] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:24:52] of God in him
[1:24:55] 1st John 4:17 herein is our love made
[1:24:58] perfect that we may have boldness
[1:25:01] confidence in the day of judgment
[1:25:03] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:25:09] we are reflection in this world of what
[1:25:14] he is seated on the throne he ascended
[1:25:18] above every power principality and
[1:25:21] authority there is a reflection that
[1:25:24] comes from heaven down into earth has
[1:25:28] posted there I believe is in 1st
[1:25:30] Corinthians 15 as we bore hath borne the
[1:25:33] image of the earthly it is time that we
[1:25:36] bear the image of the heavenly as poet
[1:25:39] said again in the book of Philippians he
[1:25:42] said that hear our conversation our
[1:25:45] conduct our character our constitution
[1:25:48] is from heaven and he says we are
[1:25:50] looking to him who shall change
[1:25:53] this vile body our Constitution and
[1:26:01] where there's the Constitution there's
[1:26:04] some representatives there come on now
[1:26:10] they're not corrupt the Bible says that
[1:26:14] these bodies are under fire
[1:26:18] it's reserved in the heavens I'm talking
[1:26:21] about that feed off anybody's there to
[1:26:24] where that we stand we are tied back in
[1:26:27] by the Holy Ghost
[1:26:29] we are tied and identified without
[1:26:31] theophany which is representation there
[1:26:34] before the throne of Almighty God
[1:26:36] brother it is that life that is there
[1:26:39] that's reflecting out in our lives right
[1:26:41] here her because as he is so are we in
[1:26:50] this world that's a mouthful but we want
[1:26:56] it to be a heart for that scripture
[1:27:00] right there it speaks of that that slave
[1:27:03] where they came to by him is he for sale
[1:27:08] no I want to buy him nope not for sale I
[1:27:12] want to buy him he wasn't for sale and
[1:27:17] one time you and I had been sold we were
[1:27:22] sold to then sold to that sold in this
[1:27:25] sold to that but one day we heard our
[1:27:29] father calling
[1:27:32] amen and he called us to come back home
[1:27:38] we were wondering we thought this world
[1:27:40] was her home but then when he calls to
[1:27:43] us and draws us unto himself we begin we
[1:27:46] were come to the realization this world
[1:27:49] is not my home I'm just passing through
[1:27:51] I am a pilgrim and a stranger this is
[1:27:55] not level I've met that same God the
[1:27:58] living cloth the perfection I have met
[1:28:02] him and I am looking for that perfect
[1:28:04] place that matches the perfection of my
[1:28:08] soul and soon and very soon a man
[1:28:17] because we have met Melchizedek on our
[1:28:19] way back home come on somebody
[1:28:22] a man has not just been a part that's
[1:28:24] been unfolded it's not just been
[1:28:26] justification or sanctification or the
[1:28:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost but now that
[1:28:32] has all come together and made way for
[1:28:34] the very Holy Ghost himself the very
[1:28:37] person of Christ to step into his body
[1:28:40] brother we have already met our milk
[1:28:44] hesitant and the same thing he did to
[1:28:46] Abraham blessed be Abram of the Most
[1:28:50] High God a man has revealed to you and I
[1:28:53] who we are where we come from and where
[1:28:56] we are going because as he is so are we
[1:29:02] in this world there is no fear in love
[1:29:08] but perfect love casts out fear aren't
[1:29:14] you glad for that and you know what it
[1:29:18] keeps doing casting it out things try to
[1:29:22] come cast it out you know what cast it
[1:29:24] out means you know what this word cast
[1:29:26] out means right here it means to
[1:29:28] actually to take something and for it to
[1:29:31] be removed and you don't care where it
[1:29:33] falls
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:38] simple that I think you got it you say
[1:29:41] what do you mean by that I'm not focused
[1:29:43] on that I'm focused on the one who is
[1:29:46] able to lift that hey man perfect love
[1:29:51] casts out all fear don't worry I got
[1:29:54] another one up here because fear hath
[1:29:59] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:30:02] perfect in love we left him because he
[1:30:06] first loved us
[1:30:12] I'm gonna have to skip something here I
[1:30:15] think for just a moment
[1:30:21] [Music]
[1:30:25] my momma
[1:30:31] huh
[1:30:33] hey what you're doing well I'm just
[1:30:35] waiting
[1:30:43] I want you to think about this for a
[1:30:47] moment and we talked about the advocate
[1:30:52] our advocate and his benefits when you
[1:30:59] look at Abraham and Sarah think about
[1:31:03] their lives think about the journey that
[1:31:06] they were on and they were in God
[1:31:11] Himself couldn't get to Sarah because of
[1:31:16] Abraham what I mean is is that when they
[1:31:19] came down there
[1:31:20] here we see through the whole process of
[1:31:23] their life their ups and their downs but
[1:31:27] God could not get to Sarah because Sarah
[1:31:32] was United with Abraham said alright now
[1:31:39] to recognize that within that how God
[1:31:43] would would see that in in in in that
[1:31:46] light of how that they were united
[1:31:48] together let me just move ahead and
[1:31:51] leave that point here this morning and
[1:31:53] move into the scripture where it says in
[1:31:56] colossians 3:22 obey your parents in all
[1:32:02] things for this is well pleasing unto
[1:32:06] the Lord father's provoke not your
[1:32:11] children to anger lest they be
[1:32:15] discouraged now when we we think of this
[1:32:19] in here in light of the scripture
[1:32:21] remember how that we have looking at
[1:32:24] this with the advocate that we have he
[1:32:27] makes intercession upon our ignorance
[1:32:30] he's there pleading on our behalf as a
[1:32:32] matter of fact brother Branham as I read
[1:32:34] it to you last week he says when we walk
[1:32:37] into anything I walk like a little kid
[1:32:40] and he says there's he said like a
[1:32:43] little fellow he said there's there's
[1:32:44] things where there's a dark world that's
[1:32:46] full of enemies full of sin full of
[1:32:48] traps full of everything and I wish I
[1:32:51] could just preach this morning on traps
[1:32:53] because in your mind don't just get into
[1:32:55] traps oh well praise God you know I
[1:32:57] haven't had no traps of sin there's a
[1:32:58] lot of traps that would try that the
[1:33:00] Satan sets to try and what his objective
[1:33:03] is is to stifle the working of the
[1:33:07] Spirit of God in your life
[1:33:09] a trap is a trap is a trap anything that
[1:33:14] comes between you and the Lord is a trap
[1:33:19] it might have a family name tacked on it
[1:33:21] but it's a trap whoo preach brother
[1:33:24] sender traps are everywhere and remember
[1:33:28] a trap don't look like a trap it's setup
[1:33:30] and disguised and Satan knows his
[1:33:35] brother hidden let me tell you something
[1:33:37] he knows us real well he knows what's
[1:33:45] real well but don't be afraid of that
[1:33:47] you need to keep your eyes on the Lord
[1:33:49] Jesus amen
[1:33:52] he's constantly the the Holy Spirit is
[1:33:55] constantly making an advocate for us
[1:33:58] all the time even in a row he's there
[1:34:04] advocating on our behalf you understand
[1:34:07] the nature his life it's his life inside
[1:34:11] of us tied in their throat these are not
[1:34:13] two different natures it's the same it's
[1:34:16] the same what is here is what's that OMA
[1:34:23] Philippians 1:6
[1:34:26] being confident of this very thing that
[1:34:31] he which hath begun a good work in you
[1:34:36] will perform it unto the day of Jesus
[1:34:41] Christ who began the good work in you he
[1:34:47] did who will perform it he is and he
[1:34:54] will unto the day of Jesus Christ
[1:34:58] now in numbers 14 11 because we realize
[1:35:05] when we look upon these things I want to
[1:35:08] look into something here a little part
[1:35:10] within the word on our advocate and his
[1:35:13] benefits the Bible says and the Lord
[1:35:20] said unto Moses now the setting for this
[1:35:22] is where you've just had him to go and
[1:35:24] spy out the land 12 of 10 of them come
[1:35:29] back with a bad report about the land
[1:35:34] two of them come back and said here is
[1:35:38] the gear as the great all that what God
[1:35:42] has said he will do that's what they
[1:35:49] were standing on did they know there are
[1:35:51] obstacles they did but that was not the
[1:35:53] focus faith is what conquers and here we
[1:36:03] find what has taken place another
[1:36:07] interruption in the journey I'm the Lord
[1:36:12] said unto Moses know watch how long will
[1:36:16] this people provoke me how long will it
[1:36:20] be err they believe me for all the signs
[1:36:23] which I have showed among them I will
[1:36:28] smite them with the pestilence and
[1:36:30] disinherit them and will make a V a
[1:36:33] greater nation and mightier than they
[1:36:37] the Lord would have consumed he would
[1:36:43] have consumed them he's looking notice
[1:36:46] he's looking upon their sin he's looking
[1:36:50] on what is taking place now remember
[1:36:52] listen to me now God ain't separating
[1:36:55] things out God has let it be known I'll
[1:36:57] wipe every one of them out doc didn't
[1:37:02] say I'll wipe everyone except for this
[1:37:04] one
[1:37:04] no sir he's looking at our life every
[1:37:08] single one out and then I'll
[1:37:11] up from you imagination but verse 13
[1:37:18] Moses said unto the Lord then the
[1:37:23] Egyptians shall hear it for thou
[1:37:26] broughtest up this people in thy might
[1:37:28] from among them and they will tell it to
[1:37:31] the inhabitants of the land you see just
[1:37:35] like faith can travel unbelief can
[1:37:37] travel and they will tell it to the
[1:37:40] inhabitants of this land for they have
[1:37:44] heard that thou Lord art among this
[1:37:48] people that thou Lord art seen
[1:37:51] face-to-face and that by cloud standeth
[1:37:54] over them and that thou goest before
[1:37:56] them by daytime in a pillar of cloud and
[1:37:59] in a pillar fire by night now if thou
[1:38:03] shalt kill all this people as one man
[1:38:06] then the nations which have heard the
[1:38:09] fame of Eve will speak saying because
[1:38:12] the Lord was not able to bring this
[1:38:15] people into the land which he sware unto
[1:38:17] them therefore he has slain them in the
[1:38:20] wilderness
[1:38:24] dusty scriptures alone it has the red it
[1:38:27] has the prayer a true identity of the
[1:38:28] true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:30] there were many signs and wonders that
[1:38:33] were done the Red Sea was opened
[1:38:36] everything that was done in Egypt there
[1:38:39] were many things nature was disturbed
[1:38:42] darkness came upon the scene but we're
[1:38:45] healing all of these things along the
[1:38:47] way but it showed that was not God's
[1:38:51] purpose for sending the message was to
[1:38:55] produce signs and miracles but the
[1:38:58] purpose is to get man in position in the
[1:39:02] promised
[1:39:05] that's where Pentecost failed they
[1:39:11] failed to recognize what are the signs
[1:39:14] and wonders about that's the same way
[1:39:17] with the message that God has sent to
[1:39:20] you and I
[1:39:20] that's why brother Brennan would step
[1:39:22] back here in 1960 as I was with Moses so
[1:39:25] long I'll be with thee and brother
[1:39:27] Branham would drug back because he said
[1:39:29] if you can't believe by now to believe
[1:39:34] all the sands and the wonders that God
[1:39:37] has done he said if you can't believe by
[1:39:40] now nothing will help you so to
[1:39:43] understand what are the signs and
[1:39:45] wonders about you know as well as I do
[1:39:47] there's people that come and they're
[1:39:49] healed signs and wonders and they go
[1:39:51] right back out in the world when they
[1:39:54] fall on hard times pray for me but when
[1:39:57] they're going in when the hard times are
[1:39:59] over they go on live in Andrew forget
[1:40:01] about they've asked for God to move on
[1:40:04] their need God wants to do more than
[1:40:06] just heal your body he wants to heal
[1:40:09] yourself because your body if it's
[1:40:13] healed today it can be sick by next
[1:40:16] weekend but once that soul has been
[1:40:21] healed brother they can never be since
[1:40:25] it again God's desire when blood sins a
[1:40:31] word is to bring his people into
[1:40:35] position in the promise he makes his
[1:40:38] promise known I come down to call him
[1:40:41] out and to bring him into a land that
[1:40:43] floweth with milk and honey it was to
[1:40:45] bring them into position listen to me
[1:40:48] now God revealed that to Moses he told
[1:40:52] Moses that let me say this that word
[1:40:54] took such a hold in Moses life - even in
[1:40:57] this situation it was not Moses thinking
[1:41:00] by a cure of pure carnal thinking it was
[1:41:03] God it was Christ inside of Moses that
[1:41:07] was crying out on behalf of a promise
[1:41:11] what happened when Moses spoke it was
[1:41:15] Christ he and Moses that did what it
[1:41:17] took the attention from off the people's
[1:41:20] rebellion and put it on cries
[1:41:23] back on the blood let me preach a little
[1:41:29] bit here there's got to be an atonement
[1:41:33] there's got to be a perpetuation there's
[1:41:37] got to be that to where you and I that
[1:41:40] even in the midst of Rome there's got to
[1:41:42] be a way back hey hey man oh my to think
[1:41:50] of it then they in other words what ha
[1:41:52] ha the Spirit of Christ is speaking
[1:41:54] through Moses in other words he said
[1:41:57] when they hear this think of this can
[1:41:59] you imagine
[1:42:00] they will say you know yeah he was able
[1:42:03] to bring you out of Egypt yeah he's a
[1:42:05] murdering in my vision
[1:42:06] he opened the Red Sea yeah yeah yeah I
[1:42:08] heard this he and Burt brought water the
[1:42:09] rock yo he did he brought water on the
[1:42:11] wrong he fed them with manna yep he sure
[1:42:12] did that I understand that they're
[1:42:14] closed in well nope they're closed don't
[1:42:15] wear now my goodness
[1:42:17] how powerful and yet he couldn't bring
[1:42:19] him in the land you know what they were
[1:42:22] saying he can't keep his promise that's
[1:42:26] what the Spirit of Christ is speaking in
[1:42:28] Moses is to let us know God keeps his
[1:42:32] promise being confident of this one
[1:42:36] thing that he that hath become the good
[1:42:39] work in you will perform it until the
[1:42:42] day of Jesus Christ who listen inside of
[1:42:46] you
[1:42:46] it's Christ in you the hope of glory God
[1:42:53] don't amend his word God don't say what
[1:42:56] we're living up here you knowing
[1:42:57] generation pqi X Y Z we're living up
[1:43:03] here you know in generation silver spoon
[1:43:05] God don't amend his word for that the
[1:43:09] same requirements
[1:43:11] amen hallelujah in both areas the power
[1:43:16] and the advocacy of the Spirit of Christ
[1:43:19] working with the promise of the world
[1:43:23] Amen is the very heart of God himself
[1:43:26] and how Moses cries out here the Spirit
[1:43:30] of God verse 17 and now I beseech thee
[1:43:35] now I beseech thee let the power of my
[1:43:41] Lord be great according as thou has
[1:43:44] spoken saying the Lord is long-suffering
[1:43:47] in a great mercy forgiving iniquity and
[1:43:50] transgression and by no means clearing
[1:43:52] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[1:43:54] father's upon the children under the
[1:43:56] third and fourth generation pardon I
[1:43:59] beseech thee the iniquity of this people
[1:44:02] according unto the greatness of that
[1:44:06] mercy as thou hast forgiven this people
[1:44:10] from Egypt even until now to pardon is
[1:44:15] to forgive now there's been a breach in
[1:44:20] fellowship
[1:44:23] there's been a break in fellowship God
[1:44:26] cannot have fellowship with unbelief but
[1:44:33] there's gotta be one who's able to stand
[1:44:37] in the gap there's gotta be one who's
[1:44:42] able to stand in the breach the Bible
[1:44:48] tells I believe it Psalms 106 he said
[1:44:50] how that God found a man by the name of
[1:44:51] Moses to stand in the breach it was not
[1:44:54] the flesh it was the Spirit of Christ
[1:44:56] the promise word in that hour what was
[1:44:59] it doing it was stand-in there old
[1:45:01] brother and sister let me tell you
[1:45:03] something as we are taking in of that
[1:45:06] word living under that word living under
[1:45:09] the blood let me tell you what that is
[1:45:10] as you're heating the word it is drawing
[1:45:13] God's attention to the word and in that
[1:45:15] word is prevailing power he meant to
[1:45:19] move down in your life and this you and
[1:45:23] do for you what God said he would do oh
[1:45:30] my there's only one way how can
[1:45:33] fellowship be restored there's got to be
[1:45:37] a go-between to go between these two
[1:45:40] parties come on somebody
[1:45:42] amen there's got to be something to to
[1:45:45] bring it back together God don't like
[1:45:52] disunity that's why he gave a writing
[1:45:57] for the bill of divorcement back in the
[1:46:00] Old Testament God said I don't want
[1:46:02] people pretending I give him a writing
[1:46:06] for a bill of divorcement
[1:46:08] y'all got quiet on me now God wants you
[1:46:14] to be heart and soul all the way sold
[1:46:17] out to him hallelujah there's got to be
[1:46:23] one that can stand in the presence of
[1:46:25] the Lord on our behalf and be able to
[1:46:28] perpetuate on our behalf that through
[1:46:32] the repentance of the wrong
[1:46:34] the
[1:46:34] fellowship is restored I need a little
[1:46:38] bit more time I can't break this here
[1:46:41] and the Lord said I have pardoned
[1:46:46] according to thy word
[1:46:52] Moses word was God's Word Moses is not
[1:46:59] speak listen to me now this is not human
[1:47:01] compassion no sir this is not human
[1:47:06] compassion this is the compassion of
[1:47:09] Almighty God because we saw glimpses of
[1:47:17] Moses compassion it's like your
[1:47:20] compassion and mine
[1:47:21] he has limits brother Brown would say
[1:47:27] like this so we understand it he said
[1:47:30] then people aggravated him come on now
[1:47:35] you've got people that aggravate you
[1:47:36] don't look next door you got people
[1:47:42] differences it's not the compassion of
[1:47:47] Moses this is the compassion of God
[1:47:51] listen to me you cannot separate the
[1:47:54] messenger and his message to God here it
[1:48:01] is the Spirit of Christ within that
[1:48:03] think of how Moses would have felt let's
[1:48:05] look at Moses if it's just as a man he'd
[1:48:07] feel just like you and I do goodness'
[1:48:09] man what's going on
[1:48:11] what in the world's happening here but
[1:48:16] God's got it all in control
[1:48:19] amen in verse 21 but as truly as I live
[1:48:24] all the earth shall be filled with the
[1:48:27] glory of the Lord that's coming to pass
[1:48:30] I said that's coming to pass this is a
[1:48:33] millennial promise right here right here
[1:48:37] I have pardoned according to that word
[1:48:38] and then the very next scripture it ties
[1:48:41] into a millennial promise there's a
[1:48:44] the work that takes place between these
[1:48:46] two verses of Scripture come home
[1:48:50] somebody may remember there's a great
[1:48:52] big God who is there and has been
[1:48:54] lessened between these two scriptures to
[1:48:57] bring it to pass and that same great big
[1:48:59] God has made himself so small and so
[1:49:01] simple to come into your life and my
[1:49:04] life and brother what is needed from
[1:49:06] beginning to end there's a great big God
[1:49:08] moving and working to bring it to pass
[1:49:11] what is it our advocate and his benefits
[1:49:19] hallelujah
[1:49:20] oh my that's why when brother Branham
[1:49:25] would remember he would remind sister
[1:49:28] Bruce he said before God I'm not a
[1:49:31] sinner and neither are you
[1:49:34] we got a blood sacrifice laying there
[1:49:36] God don't even see us he hears our voice
[1:49:42] but he sees the blood of Christ you hear
[1:49:47] me he hears our voice but he sees the
[1:49:50] blood of Christ will that say there is a
[1:49:53] union that has taken place amen this
[1:49:56] blood speaker
[1:49:59] this token life speaketh hey man he
[1:50:06] hears our voice but he sees the blood of
[1:50:09] Christ he sees the blood of his own son
[1:50:12] it's our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:50:16] Christ that's talking through us to God
[1:50:20] so therefore were not sinners no more as
[1:50:27] Moses said pardon happy seeks thee
[1:50:31] according to that word it was the Spirit
[1:50:33] of Christ in Moses brunet said what God
[1:50:36] saw when he look there he saw across in
[1:50:40] Moses what is the atonement has been
[1:50:43] made it has been accepted and you are
[1:50:46] included in it it is the voice of Christ
[1:50:49] the voice of the blood the Holy Ghost
[1:50:51] inside of you and me our advocate his
[1:50:56] benefits
[1:51:08] my momma
[1:51:15] fellowship is broken it's got to be
[1:51:18] restored is that right
[1:51:26] when we have grieved the spirit of God
[1:51:32] fellowships got to be restored
[1:51:34] I tell you this right now
[1:51:38] as a believer it troubles you when
[1:51:43] you're not having fellowship with him it
[1:51:49] bothers you it bothered me if I was in
[1:51:53] my house and my wife wouldn't talk to me
[1:51:57] they'll get quiet now it'd bother me I
[1:52:01] would definitely think something's wrong
[1:52:04] you know what I want to know what's
[1:52:08] wrong why so it can get made right have
[1:52:16] I done something dumb
[1:52:17] which prone to do have I not been
[1:52:21] thoughtful in this or this come up or
[1:52:23] this or that
[1:52:25] well we this is good preaching right now
[1:52:33] why because the love of God and the love
[1:52:37] within my heart is I don't want nothing
[1:52:41] between us and that's how I feel in the
[1:52:46] natural you and you and I on the
[1:52:49] spiritual level as sons and daughters of
[1:52:50] God you know when there's something that
[1:52:53] displeases him sometimes it's not even
[1:52:56] the action sometimes it's the attitude
[1:52:58] behind it you see it listen to me now if
[1:53:03] the Spirit of God through the word
[1:53:04] bringing us to that sensitivity as
[1:53:08] brother Ram would say to recognize the
[1:53:10] devil at every one of his tricks and
[1:53:13] then don't just stop with that first
[1:53:16] statement and then recognize that the
[1:53:20] God in you has already overcome that and
[1:53:23] greater is He that is in you well
[1:53:31] there's got to be a restoring of that
[1:53:34] fellowship so how can fellowship be
[1:53:36] restored when you have here when
[1:53:39] something has taken place there's got to
[1:53:41] come repentance is that right and
[1:53:45] repentance let me just say it to you
[1:53:47] like this maybe I'll just drop back and
[1:53:49] teach for a few moments repentance is
[1:53:51] more than an acknowledgment of an
[1:53:54] offense it's more than an acknowledging
[1:53:58] of an offense that is only the very memo
[1:54:03] Nisei taught that's the not even
[1:54:06] elementary but the preschool part of
[1:54:08] repentance
[1:54:10] but the goal of repentence what true
[1:54:13] repentance is is to remove the
[1:54:15] underlying condition in the heart you
[1:54:21] with me
[1:54:23] what is that the Bible says that the rod
[1:54:26] when the rod as it amongst it and for in
[1:54:29] Proverbs you take the rod the rod is a
[1:54:31] rod of Correction now when does
[1:54:34] correction come correction doesn't come
[1:54:36] from frustration or from us of how they
[1:54:40] did something I didn't want know if
[1:54:41] there's been teaching that's went on and
[1:54:43] they went beyond that
[1:54:44] then the correction comes and God is
[1:54:47] faithful to correct us he says that rod
[1:54:51] and thy staff they comfort me hey man he
[1:54:55] doesn't have it's not a rod and then a
[1:54:57] separate thing there's one end it
[1:54:58] depends on what's going on at what end
[1:55:00] he's using it but it all comes out to be
[1:55:03] the same because it's there to lead us
[1:55:06] are you with me so now that that
[1:55:09] correction comes to do what to do what
[1:55:11] the Bible says to drive out the
[1:55:14] foolishness that is bound up in the
[1:55:16] heart is to drive that out no longer in
[1:55:20] the heart is the purpose that has
[1:55:23] committed the offense
[1:55:25] oh my verse 22 because all those men
[1:55:30] have watch this watch watch how God
[1:55:31] comes down he goes because all those men
[1:55:34] which have seen my glory had my miracles
[1:55:37] which I did in Egypt and in the
[1:55:38] wilderness and have tempted me now these
[1:55:40] ten times and have not hearkened to my
[1:55:42] voice surely they shall not see the land
[1:55:45] which I swear unto their fathers neither
[1:55:48] shall any of them that provoked me see
[1:55:51] it but my servant Caleb listen to me now
[1:55:56] this is why there had to be that on the
[1:55:59] inside of Moses that called out pardon
[1:56:02] according to that word come on now
[1:56:06] because what there was a camp in that
[1:56:09] bunch I said there was a cane up in that
[1:56:13] bunch come on somebody but my servant
[1:56:17] Caleb see God now notice what does the
[1:56:21] blood do indirect my servant Caleb
[1:56:23] because he had another spirit with him
[1:56:27] and have followed me fully him I will I
[1:56:32] bring into the land where until he went
[1:56:34] and his seed shall possess it so you can
[1:56:37] see how the Lord deals with is because
[1:56:40] of another spirit wherein he has
[1:56:41] followed me fooling him will I bring
[1:56:45] into the land now the Bible says in
[1:56:47] Psalm 78 it talks about the condition of
[1:56:51] the heart the Bible says concerning them
[1:56:54] when they were coming out of out of
[1:56:55] Egypt and through the wilderness their
[1:56:58] heart was not right with him neither
[1:57:01] were they steadfast in his covenant what
[1:57:05] was not right their heart you see
[1:57:09] repentance itself is to restore
[1:57:12] fellowship
[1:57:16] amen we need leadership to repentance
[1:57:22] are you with me we need leadership to
[1:57:25] repentance
[1:57:26] to be able to hear his voice again can I
[1:57:31] have just a few more moments the Bible
[1:57:35] says the goodness of God leadeth to
[1:57:40] repentance what does this the goodness
[1:57:44] of God in order for God for fellowship
[1:57:48] to be restored
[1:57:49] there's got to come then repentance
[1:57:52] which is full acknowledgement and
[1:57:55] acceptance of the wrong are you with me
[1:58:00] first John 1:8 if we say that we have no
[1:58:05] sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
[1:58:07] is not in us if we confess our sins he
[1:58:12] is faithful and just to forgive us our
[1:58:17] sins do you hear that he's faithful and
[1:58:20] just if we do what confess the confess
[1:58:25] isn't just I'm sorry it's from here I
[1:58:28] said it's from here confess if we
[1:58:33] confess not just with our mouth but
[1:58:35] confess with our heart confess with our
[1:58:38] mind confess in action confess means to
[1:58:43] say the same thing this is what he does
[1:58:47] he's faithful to faithful and just to
[1:58:52] forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[1:58:56] from all unrighteousness amen
[1:59:01] this is where the benefits come in oh my
[1:59:07] notice in second corinthians 7:8 paul is
[1:59:11] writing to the church here I'm coming
[1:59:15] down here let me just have just a little
[1:59:16] bit more
[1:59:20] for though I made you sorry with a
[1:59:23] letter I do not repent though I did
[1:59:26] repent for I perceive that the same
[1:59:30] epistle hath made you sorry though it
[1:59:33] were but for a season now notice what is
[1:59:38] repent repent enforce season you see
[1:59:42] them were than working true repentance
[1:59:44] is got to be a working out there right
[1:59:47] now I rejoice not that you were made
[1:59:50] sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance
[1:59:56] for ye were made sorry after a godly
[1:59:59] manner that you might receive damage by
[2:00:02] us in nothing for godly sorrow worketh
[2:00:06] repentance to salvation not to be
[2:00:11] repented of but the sorrow of the world
[2:00:14] worketh death
[2:00:18] now what's this they received the
[2:00:21] correction from the Lord therefore they
[2:00:25] sorrowed after a godly sort did you hear
[2:00:27] me there's a sorrow there's a lot of
[2:00:30] times where people are sorry just
[2:00:32] because of the condition just because of
[2:00:35] the situation it's not a godly sorrow in
[2:00:38] order for to be godly sorrow you've got
[2:00:41] to receive it the word of the Lord the
[2:00:44] word brings godly sorrow and godly
[2:00:49] sorrow worketh to repentance
[2:00:53] aren't you glad it never worked just lip
[2:00:56] service in your life well Lord I said
[2:01:00] this but you know you know that any me I
[2:01:01] I just can't help it Lord you know no
[2:01:03] sir
[2:01:04] he godly sorrow worketh repentance it
[2:01:08] brings about a desired achievement you
[2:01:13] say that's impossible with our flesh I
[2:01:15] agree
[2:01:16] but with God all things are possible
[2:01:20] [Applause]
[2:01:24] so here is this group of people they
[2:01:28] receive the word of the Lord and they
[2:01:31] have confessed from within that same
[2:01:35] thing what are they doing addressing the
[2:01:38] root of the problem if you don't address
[2:01:41] the root that same plant keeps coming
[2:01:43] back up come on somebody the same plant
[2:01:48] keeps coming back up and you can't blame
[2:01:51] other people for the root in your life
[2:01:54] preach brother Sanders come on now there
[2:01:58] is a grabbing hold of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:00] that's able to take care of that root
[2:02:03] sometimes you got to grab it out with
[2:02:06] what godly sorrow where we side with the
[2:02:09] letter and say Lord I hate that which
[2:02:12] you hate I'm siding with the word what
[2:02:16] is it it's the Spirit of Christ in you
[2:02:18] the advocacy of the Holy Ghost that
[2:02:21] desires to be restored in fellowship
[2:02:28] repentance is much deeper than the
[2:02:30] acknowledgment of the offense it's true
[2:02:34] abhorrent from the heart this is worth
[2:02:37] taking the word of the Lord his
[2:02:39] correction and applying it by submitting
[2:02:42] to it will drive out what has ever bound
[2:02:45] up in the heart I'm not going to ask you
[2:02:47] to raise your hands because I don't want
[2:02:49] nobody to be embarrassed and I don't
[2:02:51] think you would you shouldn't because
[2:02:53] there's one here to help let me tell you
[2:02:55] something what the thought the power of
[2:02:57] godly sorrow will do when you side with
[2:02:59] the word it actually has the power to
[2:03:01] drive out complexes come on now it might
[2:03:09] be a wrong feeling it has the power to
[2:03:11] drive that out come on somebody new
[2:03:14] Branson when you begin to think you've
[2:03:16] got a right to get even with somebody
[2:03:18] the Holy Ghost takes its flight not even
[2:03:21] something you said but what you thought
[2:03:24] so what do you have to do you've got to
[2:03:27] come back into the world huh you don't
[2:03:30] know what they did to me you don't know
[2:03:31] what they said you know what they want
[2:03:32] you still up there on the perch well how
[2:03:34] do I get fellowship restored you've got
[2:03:38] to come back and fellowship from your
[2:03:40] heart it's gotta be a desire from your
[2:03:44] heart to come back into fellowship and
[2:03:46] here is the powerful thing remember as
[2:03:49] the Prophet said that advocate it has
[2:03:51] mercy
[2:03:52] it stands for us it does for us what we
[2:03:55] cannot do ourselves it's where we stand
[2:03:59] with that word and said Lord this is
[2:04:02] your word I making an excuse for this no
[2:04:05] more come on somebody it's talking about
[2:04:10] receiving the Word of God hallelujah and
[2:04:15] submitting to it hallelujah let the Lord
[2:04:20] through his goodness lead us to
[2:04:22] repentance the sorrow of the world many
[2:04:28] times people are sorry but it's worldly
[2:04:32] sorrow I wish this wasn't I wish this
[2:04:39] wasn't there's many people to come I'm
[2:04:41] sorry for doing this and I'm sorry in it
[2:04:43] and it entity it ain't from the heart
[2:04:45] this is how do you know well I'm gonna
[2:04:47] read you a scripture I'm gonna read you
[2:04:50] a scripture right here that shows it
[2:04:51] repentance is not just acknowledgment of
[2:04:54] what's wrong but the Bible remember
[2:04:57] listen to me now by the word of the Lord
[2:04:59] when Moses came down from the mountain
[2:05:02] after who and he had first made that
[2:05:04] that the time before this year when
[2:05:07] Israel had made the golden calf Moses
[2:05:09] came down notice it was a Spirit of
[2:05:11] Christ interceding on that behalf when
[2:05:13] Moses came down from the mountain
[2:05:14] remember here it was you know there was
[2:05:16] a consuming of that golden calf and then
[2:05:18] there came to that time where Moses here
[2:05:21] it rose up who was on the Lord's side
[2:05:23] and let him come and stand by me is that
[2:05:27] right brother there was judgment coming
[2:05:31] there's gotta come judgment and thanks
[2:05:34] be to God there is judgment that moves
[2:05:37] judgment must begin at the house of God
[2:05:40] thank God there is judgment that is lose
[2:05:43] to be able to do what bring about the
[2:05:46] removal of what the hindrance is so that
[2:05:48] we can be restored back in fellowship
[2:05:51] thank God for the sword of the word
[2:06:01] verse 11 for behold this self thing that
[2:06:05] ye sorrowed after a godly sort what
[2:06:10] carefulness it wrought in you yeh what
[2:06:19] clearing of yourselves how in the world
[2:06:24] could they clear themselves by receiving
[2:06:27] the pardoning grace of god's word and
[2:06:31] siding with that word it moves within
[2:06:35] the life yet what indignation
[2:06:39] what fear what the hemming that desire
[2:06:42] yeh what zeal yeh what revenge uh-oh
[2:06:47] the guy who had been pulling the wool
[2:06:49] over the eyes had been exposed now that
[2:06:53] devil that cost me to believe mr. doctor
[2:06:56] whatever month what is it it's turning
[2:06:58] now on the very one who's had the wool
[2:07:01] pulled over the eyes come on somebody in
[2:07:04] all things ye have approved yourselves
[2:07:07] to be clear in this manner let me show
[2:07:11] you one more place in the scripture you
[2:07:13] wish to take what is given when God
[2:07:16] comes there's not that we our flesh does
[2:07:19] not like correction but we need to be
[2:07:22] corrected we need to be admonished we
[2:07:24] need to be trained
[2:07:26] a man has we've been born in his spirit
[2:07:29] now we are trained to be conformed to
[2:07:31] his image we need those times just
[2:07:34] within
[2:07:34] child training there has to be
[2:07:36] correction that
[2:07:38] that's necessary is that right so it's
[2:07:42] it's it's what's important is its to
[2:07:45] take what is given let it go beyond the
[2:07:48] flesh and because the reality when our
[2:07:50] heart our heart has a believer it craves
[2:07:54] fellowship with God it craves fellowship
[2:08:01] with God I look at this with Esther
[2:08:07] she's brought in if here she comes in it
[2:08:12] comes her time to come before the king
[2:08:14] and remember Paul wrote you were made
[2:08:18] sorry for a season why godly sorrow
[2:08:24] worketh repentance now just stay with me
[2:08:29] now the Bible says in Esther 2:12 when
[2:08:33] every maids turn was come to go in to
[2:08:36] King has arose after that she had been
[2:08:39] 12 months according to the manner woman
[2:08:41] for so were the days of her purification
[2:08:43] accomplished to win six months with oil
[2:08:47] of myrrh and six months with sweet
[2:08:50] odours and with other things for the
[2:08:51] purifying of the women but 7 what are
[2:08:56] you saying I'm not saying you've got to
[2:08:58] wait 12 months I'm not saying that
[2:09:03] you've got to wait even five minutes for
[2:09:07] fellowship to be restored what I am
[2:09:10] Telling You is that godly sorrow worketh
[2:09:13] repentance and for it to work that
[2:09:18] working depends on do we want fellowship
[2:09:23] with him here come the little lady in
[2:09:26] the prayer line how many how many times
[2:09:29] here brother Branham here he is standing
[2:09:31] step off for a moment talk talk with the
[2:09:34] person and come right back into the
[2:09:36] microphone
[2:09:37] how many times you've heard me tell the
[2:09:39] story over and over and over of the one
[2:09:41] particular here here come here come a
[2:09:43] little a little little little young lady
[2:09:47] smoking cigarettes a lot that she was
[2:09:50] living she come up here on the platform
[2:09:53] and she prayed in her heart she didn't
[2:09:59] want her mama to find out about her
[2:10:00] smoking but what she prayed she said
[2:10:03] Lord take this smoking away from me nor
[2:10:07] Jesus forgive me she walked right up in
[2:10:10] the presence of the Lord that was
[2:10:14] accompanying his prophet and the Prophet
[2:10:19] could not even find smoking in her you
[2:10:25] know why her heart had yielded to the
[2:10:30] word of the Lord that's the power of the
[2:10:35] word as it works in advocacy this is
[2:10:39] part of the benefits of our life as a
[2:10:42] believer and I'll stop on that this
[2:10:48] morning it's the power of the word God
[2:10:53] wants and longs and delights for your
[2:10:57] fellowship and I think that one thing
[2:11:01] that we could really be honest and be
[2:11:04] able to look at that and say Lord I
[2:11:07] don't want anything I don't want none of
[2:11:09] my feelings my thoughts I want
[2:11:13] fellowship with you I'll tell you
[2:11:16] friends people that make excuses for
[2:11:19] things they stay in their conditions you
[2:11:23] stay in your condition I don't say that
[2:11:26] to be harsh I say that because there is
[2:11:29] no excuse to stay in your condition
[2:11:32] there is one who is actually able to
[2:11:35] restore fellowship and he wants to
[2:11:39] that's why he would even lay this and
[2:11:41] bring this on my heart
[2:11:43] for this service right here this morning
[2:11:46] if you're out of fellowship you don't
[2:11:49] got to do penance you need to confess it
[2:11:53] and get under the blood if you don't
[2:11:58] know the Lord Jesus Christ in the powers
[2:12:00] resurrection you need to get under the
[2:12:02] blood you need to say this is what you
[2:12:05] need to say you need to say lord give me
[2:12:07] a heart that'll seek after you that's
[2:12:12] what you need to say first let me seek
[2:12:14] after you I want to seek after you it's
[2:12:20] not a church it's not an idea it's the
[2:12:22] person I want to seek after you the Lord
[2:12:25] Ascott be honest with him
[2:12:27] listen God don't look at it say oh your
[2:12:30] heart's not seeking after me
[2:12:31] no David said thou has said unto me seek
[2:12:35] after me and my heart said after thee
[2:12:37] will I seek Oh God
[2:12:39] align with the word and say nah it's you
[2:12:43] that I need that's that's the same thing
[2:12:47] with every heart in every life that is
[2:12:50] gathered here this morning you don't
[2:12:52] have to walk out of here
[2:12:53] even under condemnation you can walk out
[2:12:56] of here free you can walk out of here
[2:12:59] where Fellowship is restored you believe
[2:13:05] that they men there's up working power
[2:13:08] that is present not just to bring
[2:13:12] acknowledgement but to go to work to
[2:13:16] remove anything that's bound up there
[2:13:20] aren't you glad bless the Lord O my soul
[2:13:25] and all that is within me bless His Holy
[2:13:31] Name
[2:13:32] you know David saying every part of me
[2:13:34] buses the Lord and if there's a chamber
[2:13:38] of your life that in blessing it oxy you
[2:13:40] gotta go I want to bless the Lord with
[2:13:44] my whole heart

[2:14:02] all his benefits who healeth me of all
[2:14:09] thy diseases who forgiveth me of all
[2:14:14] thine iniquities who redeemeth thy life
[2:14:18] from destruction who satisfies thy mouth
[2:14:23] with good things so that your strength
[2:14:27] is renewed like an eagle you might be
[2:14:31] sitting here this morning and it may not
[2:14:33] be that you're out of fellowship because
[2:14:36] of something that there's been an
[2:14:38] interruption as far as sin you might be
[2:14:41] sitting here this morning because you've
[2:14:43] just not been given time to him you've
[2:14:47] not been putting him first in your life
[2:14:52] but all it takes is a little talk with
[2:14:56] Jesus
[2:14:59] Lord I'm sorry that I've put everything
[2:15:03] else before you and I've given you the
[2:15:06] leftovers you deserve you deserve
[2:15:10] everything he's here if you've lost the
[2:15:21] joy of his salvation he's here to
[2:15:24] restore it he's here to restore it let
[2:15:30] me just taste something to restore that
[2:15:31] joy you know the Bible tells us and
[2:15:39] they've been looking at that joy in the
[2:15:40] book of Joel you know what took away
[2:15:42] that joy there was some bug's that came
[2:15:45] in and start eating on the tree and bugs
[2:15:48] came in and they removed the crop
[2:15:50] whereby the mill offering was offered in
[2:15:53] the mill offering as Christ those bugs
[2:15:56] came and they began to destroy the vines
[2:15:59] from which the grapes are taken that
[2:16:01] makes the wine and their joy was taken
[2:16:04] because they said we have no meat or
[2:16:06] drink offering to bring to the house of
[2:16:09] the Lord but why had it been taken
[2:16:12] because they got their eyes off of him
[2:16:15] who is the creator that provides all
[2:16:19] things and there's no greater delight
[2:16:22] and greater joy for a believer than to
[2:16:24] be able to take and to say Lord what
[2:16:27] you've given me look what your life has
[2:16:30] brought forth look Lord what your life
[2:16:34] look what what you have done or look at
[2:16:37] the working in your life my lord I thank
[2:16:39] you for your working what is it it's
[2:16:41] offering up the meal offering and the
[2:16:45] wine and that's joy you might walk out
[2:16:50] of here you can walk out of here with
[2:16:52] the joy restored but you might walk out
[2:16:55] of here and you might be a little down
[2:16:58] but if you've prayed and you've made
[2:17:01] that restitution with God you have
[2:17:05] brought everything under the blood let
[2:17:07] me just tell you something right now it
[2:17:09] already starts working this starts
[2:17:13] working it starts working on our behalf
[2:17:18] that there would be the meat offering
[2:17:21] and the drink offering restoring to me
[2:17:24] the joy of that salvation I'm telling
[2:17:27] you this morning I'm not speaking down
[2:17:29] to you there's been times I've been down
[2:17:31] in my life but I think you can agree
[2:17:33] with me as sons and daughters of God
[2:17:34] when we consider what God has done for
[2:17:38] us what he has done for us
[2:17:41] what he's doing in us and where that we
[2:17:44] are going to when we get to looking at
[2:17:46] that I said Lord how can I be down
[2:17:50] looking at circumstances but lord let me
[2:17:53] look to You Lord Jesus I'm glad that he
[2:18:00] restores fellowship and it's the Spirit
[2:18:04] of Christ in us by the baptism of the
[2:18:07] Holy Ghost he's constantly making an
[2:18:10] advocate for us I say this morning if
[2:18:14] you don't have that in your heart why
[2:18:17] don't you receive it receive you have
[2:18:21] that blessedness in your heart why don't
[2:18:24] you just love him just love him tell him
[2:18:27] how much you love him how much you
[2:18:29] appreciate his care for your life you
[2:18:31] know thank you for watching over me you
[2:18:34] know you're my joy but same you don't
[2:18:36] know how down I feel but the Bible said
[2:18:38] let the redeemed of the Lord say so Amen
[2:18:42] I let the weak say that I am strong hey
[2:18:45] man let the poor say I am rich hey man
[2:18:50] we've got a promise here that God has
[2:18:53] made and God is faithful to his word to
[2:18:55] back up his promise
[2:18:57] hallelujah are you glad for that this
[2:19:00] morning let's pray Lord Jesus
[2:19:06] I don't know the Lord the knees that
[2:19:12] would be around this assembly I know of
[2:19:15] some needs I know of needs that we
[2:19:17] prayed for but father when we look into
[2:19:21] your word we know Lord God that you're
[2:19:25] mindful the Lord you minister to our
[2:19:28] hearts your God very directly
[2:19:33] Lord I ask this morning that has your
[2:19:37] word has come forth Lord we want to be
[2:19:42] under that word fully we want our hearts
[2:19:45] to be so in line with that word you know
[2:19:49] when correction would come and as it
[2:19:53] does come we want to say thank you for
[2:19:55] it thank you for correcting us in order
[2:19:59] for you to forgive one of the benefits
[2:20:02] is you correct in order to forgive
[2:20:06] you've already lord forgive it you
[2:20:09] forgiving all our iniquities but Lord to
[2:20:13] think how could there be any forgiveness
[2:20:17] if there wasn't repentance but you
[2:20:20] already Lord it's not something that you
[2:20:23] are going back to Calvary to have to
[2:20:26] offer up again you paid for past present
[2:20:30] and future sins you paid for it all Lord
[2:20:35] we thank you this morning Lord how that
[2:20:39] you move upon our hearts to restore that
[2:20:43] fellowship maybe there's one that's here
[2:20:47] it's Lord that they're out of fellowship
[2:20:50] what is a believer they're walking under
[2:20:53] the blood they're our soul they're under
[2:20:56] the blood but maybe they're out of
[2:20:59] fellowship with you and the Lord as your
[2:21:03] spirit would move forth this morning it
[2:21:05] would woo to them
[2:21:07] don't let anything
[2:21:09] stand between let it all be really put
[2:21:13] under the blood let let him remedy
[2:21:17] everything in the heart to really get to
[2:21:23] the heart of the matter
[2:21:26] Lord
[2:21:30] we need strength and you give a strip
[2:21:36] more there's not a person as a believer
[2:21:41] the Lord they are aware when there's
[2:21:46] wrong they're aware Lord even to that
[2:21:49] point that we spoke about even an
[2:21:51] attitude or thought they realized Holy
[2:21:55] Spirit within us they're drawn to that
[2:22:01] Lord I asked right now that God that
[2:22:08] they would just allow allow you very
[2:22:11] simply Lord by your word to come and to
[2:22:17] restore
[2:22:19] in a broken fellowship from their heart
[2:22:23] siding with that word Lord I say what
[2:22:26] you say
[2:22:29] i side with you I I take my part on the
[2:22:33] Lord's side I'm standing here with this
[2:22:37] word Lord ask this morning God for this
[2:22:43] congregation Lord in this portion of the
[2:22:50] word that we've looked at if it wasn't
[2:22:53] for the advocate if it wasn't Lord for
[2:22:57] that perfection of Christ within us
[2:22:59] where would we be where would we be
[2:23:02] without the Advocate of the father Jesus
[2:23:06] Christ the righteous Lord it's not our
[2:23:08] desire to do wrong
[2:23:10] that's not our desire our desire from
[2:23:17] our heart is to please you Lord once
[2:23:20] again I ask if there's one that does not
[2:23:22] have that Lord seated in their heart may
[2:23:25] they in humility just ask you this
[2:23:30] morning
[2:23:30] say Lord
[2:23:32] calls me to seek after you I know that I
[2:23:36] need more than a church I need more than
[2:23:39] just a knowledge I need you the Lord
[2:23:43] calls me to seek after you then my heart
[2:23:47] be drawn let it chase after you Lord
[2:23:50] your presence that keeps knocking at my
[2:23:54] heart keeps knocking and dealing with my
[2:23:56] life Lord may this be a moment Lord
[2:24:09] where Fellowship is restored may it be
[2:24:13] an application Lord in our lives in our
[2:24:16] hearts may we take Lord from this and to
[2:24:21] see it Lord o God of Europe as David
[2:24:28] recorded at the Lord
[2:24:30] like as a father pitieth his children so
[2:24:35] the Lord
[2:24:36] pity them that keep his commandments
[2:24:39] aetherium Lord we asked this Lord in the
[2:24:46] name of Jesus Christ for your glory amen
[2:24:54] amen you love him because he first loved
[2:24:59] you aren't you glad for that the brand
[2:25:06] would say it like this it's to be united
[2:25:10] with him his life to be separated from
[2:25:14] him is dead
[2:25:16] now we know we make mistakes but you
[2:25:19] mustn't look at that it's not your
[2:25:22] mistakes because you're always going to
[2:25:24] happen it's following his rules
[2:25:27] following what he said do but my servant
[2:25:34] Caleb he had another spirit in him
[2:25:38] because he had followed me fully
[2:25:43] followed from that inner man it's
[2:25:46] following his rules following what he
[2:25:49] said stumbling and falling doesn't have
[2:25:52] one thing to do with it a real true
[2:25:55] servant are you a real true servant if
[2:25:58] he'll stumble he'll get up again if he
[2:26:01] wobbles God pulls him right back in the
[2:26:04] path as long as he's in the path of duty
[2:26:08] but if he's off the path of duty God's
[2:26:11] not obligated to him but as long as he's
[2:26:13] in the path of duty God's obligated to
[2:26:15] him knowing that he's just a man or
[2:26:17] woman he's obligated to that person as
[2:26:20] long as they're in the path of duty
[2:26:24] obligated obligated yes because we are
[2:26:29] in him he is in us he's obligated to his
[2:26:34] word
[2:26:37] what's he obligated to do he's obligated
[2:26:40] by his goodness to lead me to repentance
[2:26:43] when I need to repent he's obligated to
[2:26:48] correct me when I need correction he's
[2:26:51] obligated to his word when I can stand
[2:26:55] on his word he's obligated to his word
[2:26:59] that's why it's so powerful when you
[2:27:03] when repentance is what is it it's there
[2:27:06] it's God coming now to honor his word Oh
[2:27:12] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
