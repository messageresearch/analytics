[37:11] his mercy and uh so glad to be able to
[37:14] be gathered together here once again and
[37:17] we certainly want to remember different
[37:20] ones in prayer I know that uh I had
[37:24] received a text here earlier today from
[37:26] Brother Rocco he wasn't feeling too well
[37:28] and I know that uh there's been some
[37:31] others and just the sickness and I heard
[37:33] that
[37:34] request um for Sophia there and I know
[37:38] there's it's just been kind of making
[37:40] its way around uh you know so we just
[37:43] want to just continue to hold up one
[37:46] another in prayer um also to I think you
[37:50] I think you may have mentioned it too
[37:52] there's um those that are on their way
[37:54] back from the winter youth retreat there
[37:55] in Tennessee and I know just scattered
[37:58] around just driving from there and uh um
[38:01] my wife uh also she's she had been a
[38:05] little bit under the weather and uh the
[38:07] Lord has been giving her strength but
[38:08] she had to go pick up Paul tonight so at
[38:12] about that time he was traveling back
[38:13] with brother Jesse and uh because Ben
[38:17] has other reasons to stay in Tennessee a
[38:19] little
[38:19] bit
[38:21] so so you
[38:23] know just the wonderful things too too
[38:26] bad we just can't take a car and just
[38:27] drive drop it to
[38:28] them you know how it is and so um but um
[38:33] so we just want to remember one another
[38:35] in prayer and um so glad to have uh my
[38:38] mom and brother Bill here back with us
[38:40] from
[38:41] Tennessee and
[38:45] uh amen we we sure miss them and you
[38:48] know we we we miss each of you we just
[38:51] don't say that you know sometimes you
[38:53] know I can't put my finger on who's
[38:54] missing because once everybody gets s
[38:57] seated in the back I I don't know I
[38:59] think if we ever replace the pews we'll
[39:01] just have 10 chairs sitting in the back
[39:03] let's have three back rows with 10
[39:06] chairs but you know different ones of
[39:09] you set in different places and I can
[39:10] pick it out but then there's other times
[39:11] I'm looking and I'm thinking uh man was
[39:15] so and so there was so and so there and
[39:17] and this and I begin to think about that
[39:19] but we certainly want I mean that we
[39:20] miss you when you're not here amen and
[39:23] uh you know we're we're a family we're a
[39:25] body of believers amen so let's just we
[39:29] want to turn right into the the word of
[39:31] the Lord tonight and want to say thank
[39:34] you musicians God bless you um I want to
[39:38] the Lord would help us and I ask you to
[39:41] forgive me on Sunday uh my wife
[39:44] mentioned to me afterwards I got in the
[39:46] car and she said honey I was trying to
[39:48] get your attention she said but um
[39:51] you're um she said the slides and so I
[39:55] had everything here but I was preaching
[39:57] as though you were seeing them and so
[39:59] there's certain words that that emphasis
[40:02] you know that I would like to place on
[40:03] certain things that I just F on my heart
[40:05] as we come into it so I I sent we sent
[40:08] that email out with the slides and uh if
[40:11] any of you ever want the slides after
[40:13] we've done with it I'm it's just a
[40:15] simple click for me to get them and PDF
[40:17] them to you um but I know a different
[40:20] one saying hey we were trying to write
[40:21] things down we didn't know where you
[40:22] were referring to so so I certainly
[40:25] apologize for that um but um Lord may
[40:29] the Lord help us I think I caught it
[40:31] Midway through the service and I thought
[40:32] as though that Brianna had taken off the
[40:34] screen or something happened what
[40:35] happened here and so but anyhow I think
[40:38] we've got it straightened out amen don't
[40:40] you love
[40:42] technology when you can keep up with it
[40:44] and when it works it's
[40:46] wonderful so let's look here in the in
[40:48] the scriptures here tonight and we'd
[40:50] like to look at if the Lord would help
[40:52] us on this thought again on a savior and
[40:55] in the scriptures here tonight we want
[40:57] to read from Job chapter 26 and and
[41:01] verse verse 1 through verse
[41:04] 4
[41:06] and job job speaking
[41:10] here he says how hast thou helped him
[41:14] that is without power how savest thou
[41:18] the arm that hath no strength and how
[41:22] hast thou counseled him that hath no
[41:24] wisdom and how hast thou pleni declared
[41:28] the thing as it is and to whom hast thou
[41:31] uttered words and whose Spirit came from
[41:36] thee if you read throughout that chapter
[41:38] you recognize job is is really putting
[41:41] before them the great oversight of God
[41:45] that is beyond the understanding of just
[41:47] man but he's bringing a point to them
[41:49] just how the Lord's been just pressing
[41:51] on our hearts to when we look at things
[41:54] is we we want to be a channel that God
[41:57] could use and it just to put it as maybe
[42:00] as a simple illustration I can this
[42:03] microphone that I put on each time
[42:05] before I come out the microphone does
[42:07] not come out here with a thought of what
[42:09] it's going to say the microphone has not
[42:12] studied it has not it a matter of fact
[42:14] it has nothing to say but the microphone
[42:16] itself is only a channel that whereby
[42:20] that a voice can come behind it and then
[42:22] that can be carried out to you and I and
[42:24] that's just exactly where we want to be
[42:26] as Lord I want to be that kind of a
[42:29] vessel and that kind of a channel we I
[42:32] tell you it takes the grace of God so
[42:34] that our our human Spirit isn't mixed in
[42:36] at all and that's just that's a that
[42:38] takes the real touch of the Holy Spirit
[42:40] Lord help us to just be so delivered
[42:43] into your hands and God knows how God
[42:46] knows just how to work and condition and
[42:48] move in our lives so let's just look at
[42:50] him look to him in a word of prayer
[42:52] tonight Heavenly Father Lord we are just
[42:57] so thankful Lord that you've made a way
[42:59] that we are able to be here and be
[43:01] gathered tonight Lord I know in in
[43:04] different parts lord of the state with
[43:05] certain things Lord with flurries and
[43:08] some snow Lord I just ask God for your
[43:11] hand of mercy and protection we ask God
[43:14] that Lord that you would just be over it
[43:16] all Lord we pray that Lord as we have
[43:19] gathered here tonight may you come in a
[43:22] special way Lord and just God give Grace
[43:26] that the man part could just get out of
[43:28] the way and that you could come Lord and
[43:30] just speak to our hearts Lord according
[43:33] to the needs Lord that we have Lord
[43:36] there's inspiration that comes that I
[43:39] Lord have Lord laying here before me but
[43:42] Lord ultimately it always comes down to
[43:45] Lord that that inspiration and you
[43:48] leading us Lord that we might Minister
[43:50] Lord to what the needs are that's Among
[43:53] Us Lord so we just want to commit
[43:56] ourselves Lord speaker and hearer
[43:58] together that father you would be
[44:00] glorified in our midst tonight Lord may
[44:03] you minister to each life in a very
[44:05] personal way and give us Grace to step
[44:07] aside Lord we pray Lord be with those
[44:10] Lord as the request have been lifted up
[44:12] Lord for those that are suffering in
[44:15] their body Lord with sickness Lord I
[44:18] pray that God that you'll just touch
[44:20] Lord each one in a special way may the
[44:23] angel of the Lord visit each of them
[44:25] Lord right where they are oh God God may
[44:27] you watch over those that's on the road
[44:29] and traveling we pray father we just
[44:32] Commit This service Lord and all that
[44:33] would be said and done into your hands
[44:35] For Your Glory in the name of Jesus
[44:37] Christ amen amen God bless you as you're
[44:40] being seated I want to uh very quickly
[44:44] we I want to just come back into this
[44:47] place on on a savior and I'm going to go
[44:50] through uh some scriptures uh before I
[44:53] just try to Spring Forward here just a
[44:55] little bit but it's very clear that when
[44:59] job was expressing here uh to to the
[45:03] Brethren uh that were gathered there and
[45:06] you know they as we've said over and
[45:08] over I believe they had really good
[45:10] intentions but they lacked discernment
[45:13] and so there's sometimes you know the
[45:15] Bible says let us be uh Swift to hear
[45:18] and slow to speak that's usually a
[45:21] favorite scripture of brother
[45:23] Gomez's uh almost multiple times you
[45:26] know he'll repeat that to me and so uh
[45:29] you know it's something that is
[45:32] sometimes you know we can feel pressed
[45:34] as though uh we must say something or we
[45:36] must do something and we always want to
[45:39] be sure that it's God leading us and not
[45:42] us feeling under the pressure of uh
[45:45] somehow condemnation if we don't say
[45:48] something God knows exactly what he's
[45:51] doing he knows exactly whether it's to
[45:53] someone who does not know the Lord at
[45:55] all whether it's someone who's walking
[45:57] maybe in a little lesser light or maybe
[46:00] it's another brother or sister that's
[46:01] right here gathered Among Us or in
[46:04] another assembly God knows just exactly
[46:06] what you and I have need of sometimes
[46:09] it's a word sometimes it's just an ear
[46:12] sometimes it's just a heart sometimes it
[46:14] is just it's just enough just being
[46:17] present will say so many things how many
[46:20] of you probably have come to maybe a
[46:22] funeral or you've went to visit someone
[46:25] in the hospital and without even saying
[46:27] a word when you got there it was just
[46:29] your presence said enough and it was
[46:31] just an encouragement and so we know
[46:35] within this of looking at a savior we
[46:38] understand that it's not in our it's not
[46:41] in our power of for one human to save
[46:44] another human but there's only one
[46:47] Savior and that's God God is our savior
[46:50] and I want to just quickly go back
[46:52] through a couple scriptures and move
[46:54] forward from there as we look at this
[46:56] that it's God he he is our savior we're
[47:00] not we're not looking at you know by the
[47:02] grace of God through the opening of the
[47:04] word in this hour where the real true
[47:07] mystery of the godhead has been restored
[47:10] to the Church of the Living God that
[47:12] we're not you know we're not looking and
[47:14] seeing three persons three personalities
[47:17] but we recognize it is God who is above
[47:21] us God With Us it's God in us and that's
[47:24] a glorious Revelation that you find that
[47:26] it just it it never ceases it continues
[47:29] to be repeated all the way through
[47:31] because it is the truth from almighty
[47:35] God himself even when the prophet would
[47:38] stand there in uh in the first seal and
[47:40] declare that and and say you know is the
[47:43] Lamb has the book in his hand he said
[47:45] and here he is revealing these things he
[47:46] said and to understand that it is God
[47:49] himself that is actually revealing this
[47:51] and our Revelation is that it's not two
[47:54] or three separate persons but it's one
[47:56] one God and that's powerful because
[47:59] remember brother brandham said in his
[48:01] earlier days he said he always thought
[48:03] God was angry at him and Jesus loved him
[48:07] he said but then I come to find out it
[48:09] was the self-same
[48:10] person amen so notice in the scripture
[48:14] God has has designed this that that the
[48:18] strength and virtue of his own life
[48:20] would flow through the body and so when
[48:24] we look here in the scriptures Jonah
[48:26] says by inspiration salvation is of the
[48:29] Lord in Isaiah 43:11 I even I am the
[48:34] Lord and beside me there is no Savior
[48:39] and Isaiah 45 and if we just skip down
[48:42] there a little bit and it says and there
[48:45] is no God else beside me a just God and
[48:49] a savior and there is none beside me
[48:53] look unto me and be ye saved all the
[48:56] ends of the Earth Earth for I am God and
[48:59] there is none else in 1 Timothy 2:3 for
[49:03] this is good and acceptable in the sight
[49:06] of God our savior who will have all men
[49:10] to be saved and to come unto the
[49:12] knowledge of the truth so it's it's
[49:15] God's desire that all would be saved
[49:18] that there would not be one that would
[49:20] be lost but God has a complete and
[49:23] perfect will knowing those who will will
[49:26] be saved and those who will be lost so
[49:30] his choosing is not something that he's
[49:32] doing in time but his choosing was
[49:35] already from before the foundation of
[49:37] the world and it was not choosing
[49:39] something that was not a part of him but
[49:42] God chose that which was always a part
[49:46] of him of in the loins of his mind of
[49:50] his children and so to think that when
[49:52] God coming he's coming to save what
[49:56] already belonged to him to redeem and so
[50:00] to think that attribute itself of Savior
[50:03] you know it was there within God but in
[50:06] order for that attribute to be released
[50:09] the prophet takes us in the church ages
[50:11] and he says it was then God could not
[50:14] God could not make the man to fall he
[50:17] said but God created and placed that man
[50:20] on the agency a free moral agency gave
[50:23] him a choice and when the man made noise
[50:26] says God knowing all knowing that man
[50:29] would make the decision that he would
[50:31] make then he said it would release that
[50:34] attribute of Savior and this is a
[50:36] powerful statement it would give him
[50:38] then reason and purpose of being that to
[50:42] me is a powerful statement in there it
[50:44] it sets it it sets it to the reality
[50:46] that God God is interested in revealing
[50:50] and manifesting his attributes not as
[50:53] though it's something that's like we
[50:54] would look at artwork on a wall and my
[50:57] isn't that marvelous but God manifest
[51:00] his attributes by taking upon his word
[51:04] and making that word to come to pass and
[51:06] as that word is coming to pass there are
[51:09] lives that are tied into that word from
[51:12] before the foundation of the world and
[51:15] experience the effect of the of God
[51:18] God's own life moving through that word
[51:21] touching their lives it's a it's a
[51:23] channel it's like I was talking about
[51:25] before of that extension cord that's
[51:27] plugged into this source and it reaches
[51:29] somewhere else it's not the extension
[51:31] cord that has the electricity it only
[51:34] carries it it's like the wires and and
[51:37] the outlets in the wall they only they
[51:39] only carry it they're not the
[51:40] electricity and that's the same thing
[51:42] for you and I it's that we're not God
[51:45] but here we are together in the body of
[51:48] Jesus Christ and it's God working
[51:50] through our
[51:52] lives so when we see this as he said God
[51:55] our savior Paul would write of this over
[51:58] and over in that specific phrase God our
[52:01] savior and he would say who will have
[52:03] all men to be saved and come unto the
[52:05] knowledge of the truth that indwelling
[52:07] of God's life for there is one God and
[52:11] one mediator between God and Men the man
[52:14] Christ Jesus and and you know remember
[52:17] uh brother BR says where Satan I want
[52:20] you just let me just pause here for a
[52:21] minute remember when brother Brandon
[52:23] would tell us in Christ The Mystery of
[52:25] of Christ The Mystery of God and he
[52:27] would get on that part of Trinity and
[52:29] he'd said Satan has told you those lies
[52:32] to make an idolator out of you you
[52:35] recognize Spirits travel with words this
[52:39] is why the spirit of God this is why
[52:41] where the word is preached the spirit
[52:43] will travel with it this is why when
[52:46] songs about the blood are sung the
[52:48] spirit travels with it so so the spirit
[52:52] this is why in the beginning when God
[52:53] said let there be light the spirit
[52:55] traveled with the word and this is why
[52:58] that the preaching of the word of God
[53:01] that Revelation as God would drop that
[53:03] Revelation for what you and I have need
[53:06] of taking from the open book and
[53:09] ministering in season what we have need
[53:11] of it's God's unction and God's Life
[53:14] coming to meet the challenge and to
[53:17] minister to you and I for what you and I
[53:19] have need of in this hour there's no
[53:21] doubt setting in this congregation that
[53:24] either tonight or we have testified of
[53:26] it or will if God carries where we've
[53:28] come and sat here as the word is coming
[53:31] forth and maybe overwhelmed in our minds
[53:33] overwhelmed with cares of Life
[53:35] overwhelmed with different situations
[53:37] and we've been saved for years filled
[53:40] with the spirit of God and yet God comes
[53:43] down and saves us not the saving of our
[53:46] soul but he delivers us from the grip of
[53:49] anxiety of depression of of gloominess
[53:53] of Mind battles he comes because he is
[53:56] Our
[53:58] Savior and I'm so grateful for that
[54:00] because if if I could help myself I
[54:03] wouldn't need him and that's why the
[54:05] prophet said the most godd dishonoring
[54:07] proverb is that God helps those who
[54:10] helps themselves he said that's the most
[54:12] God dishonoring he helps those who
[54:15] cannot help
[54:17] themselves I don't I'm just here tonight
[54:19] to say it I need him I need him not only
[54:22] as I stand here but I need him every day
[54:24] of my life I need the grace of God the
[54:27] quickening power to bring this word to
[54:30] pass and to express and live this
[54:34] word hallelujah who do you think it was
[54:37] that came to the prophet when he stood
[54:38] there beside uh the bedside when his
[54:42] little girl was being taken his wife was
[54:44] being taken and everything that Satan
[54:46] was saying and at that time he said I
[54:48] was about ready to say if that's how
[54:50] he's going to be but something he said
[54:52] rose up from within me who was that God
[54:55] our
[54:57] savior it was down on the inside when
[55:00] all reasonings had broke away reasonings
[55:03] was already going along with where the
[55:06] serpent was hissing but that genuine
[55:08] birth on the inside that typos it cannot
[55:12] Unite with unbelief it is Faith In God's
[55:15] word and what is it it's God our
[55:20] savior thank you
[55:22] Jesus Hallelujah so it's not this is why
[55:25] when the anointing of the the word has
[55:26] come it does not it does not uh when the
[55:30] word is being ministered and the opening
[55:32] of the word we don't see C we don't see
[55:34] we don't see three persons we see God
[55:37] being revealed from from there from
[55:40] Spirit to flesh and now once again
[55:43] return back into a body of Believers we
[55:46] see the same God all
[55:49] along hallelujah thank Father and
[55:52] sometimes I I I just just as I fell on
[55:54] my heart just to just de pressing just
[55:57] to mention that as it would come to me
[55:59] because sometimes these things we I
[56:01] don't want to say we willfully but we
[56:03] can take for granted and sometimes with
[56:05] young people and others and new ones
[56:07] that we have coming in and things like
[56:09] that it it is is absolutely essential to
[56:12] recognize that the same Holy Ghost is
[56:16] God himself that came down and took upon
[56:19] the form of humanity that he might
[56:22] redeem you and I back to himself amen
[56:25] none of
[56:26] so notice he says who gave himself a
[56:30] ransom for all to be testified in due
[56:33] time God took a man took the agency of
[56:37] man and God operated through that agency
[56:41] of man in order to be a savior look at
[56:44] what happened there in the Garden of
[56:46] Eden God would have slew would have
[56:48] wiped Eve
[56:50] off but Adam stood there in the Gap in
[56:55] that moment when when God would have
[56:57] destroyed her and he stood there and he
[56:59] could stand there and he took her unto
[57:02] himself he became a savior for
[57:07] her how did that happen by his own life
[57:11] being in
[57:13] her how does how does this reality of
[57:17] Savior become to the highest and the
[57:19] greatest depth is when his life is
[57:22] dwelling inside of you and I to
[57:26] understand say yes he came to save us
[57:27] but he also the blood goes deeper for a
[57:30] deeper work of sanctifying power he goes
[57:33] to a deeper work to the very seal of the
[57:36] spirit of God and it keeps working to
[57:38] bring children of God to full maturity
[57:41] it's God working all along amen I'm glad
[57:45] about that aren't you he gave himself a
[57:47] ransom for all to be testified in due
[57:49] time in 1 Timothy 4:10 for therefore we
[57:53] both labor and suffer reproach because
[57:55] we trust in the Living God who is the
[57:58] savior of all men especially of those
[58:02] that
[58:04] believe acts 5:30 the god of our fathers
[58:07] raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged
[58:10] on a tree him hath God exalted with his
[58:14] right hand to be a prince and a savior
[58:18] for to give repentance to Israel and
[58:21] forgiveness of sins it was the complete
[58:25] sacrifice
[58:27] God come down and took upon flesh God
[58:31] came down he showed it all in typed down
[58:34] through the Old Testaments as he would
[58:36] come through the prophets but this is
[58:39] Jesus was not just a prophet he is the
[58:43] god
[58:45] Prophet God come down and tabernacled
[58:48] for Redemption and the prophet would say
[58:51] it like this an unveiling of God he has
[58:53] come this time with the Redeemer
[58:56] anointing upon his life it was
[59:00] reconciling reconciling drawing uh all
[59:03] men God through that work was
[59:05] reconciling all men unto himself and
[59:08] remember if Paul said he has committed
[59:10] unto us the word of
[59:12] reconciliation we are ambassadors of of
[59:15] Christ we are ambassadors now notice
[59:18] Paul goes on to write here in Titus 3:3
[59:21] for we ourselves also were sometimes
[59:24] foolish disobedient Ian deceived serving
[59:28] divers lust and Pleasures living in
[59:31] Malice and envy hateful and hating one
[59:34] another that that's where we were living
[59:37] that was our address right
[59:40] there but notice but after that the
[59:43] kindness and love of God our savior
[59:47] toward man
[59:50] appeared the appearing God coming down
[59:54] and notice this this appearing not only
[59:57] God come down and he tabernacled within
[1:00:00] within the body that he himself had
[1:00:03] built by his own word but now this same
[1:00:07] God is tabernacling and appearing before
[1:00:11] the Church of the Living God in redeemed
[1:00:15] vessels it's appearing is God appearing
[1:00:18] in life have noticed how Paul says by
[1:00:21] through the kindness and love of God our
[1:00:22] savior toward man appeared not by works
[1:00:26] of righteousness which we have done but
[1:00:29] according to his Mercy he saved
[1:00:32] us I'm glad for that aren't you it
[1:00:36] wasn't about that we were worthy you
[1:00:37] could read that in the opening verse the
[1:00:39] scripture said that he died for the
[1:00:42] ungodly while we were yet sinners right
[1:00:45] so it was not something so notice notice
[1:00:48] within all of this a savior is not one
[1:00:52] who is coming and and somehow measuring
[1:00:55] who who is meat to be saved but rather
[1:00:59] it's coming with a heart and that desire
[1:01:02] and it's leaving it into the hands of
[1:01:04] almighty God God himself when he came
[1:01:07] down here among you and I he already
[1:01:10] knew who would reject him he knew who
[1:01:12] would accept him he even knew who would
[1:01:14] walk all the way up to John 666 he knew
[1:01:18] all of that but he even knew that Judas
[1:01:21] at the end would turn around and betray
[1:01:23] but it did not hinder the showing of
[1:01:27] love and kindness because that love and
[1:01:30] kindness being projected the Lord he
[1:01:32] knew there were those it was intended
[1:01:35] for and they would be
[1:01:38] accepted God already knew when he sent
[1:01:41] this message in this
[1:01:44] generation he already knew who would
[1:01:46] accept it who would embrace it that's
[1:01:49] why we're not working as though to try
[1:01:51] to make converts into Christianity by
[1:01:55] the message of the hour We're simply
[1:01:58] just ministering the word letting our
[1:02:00] light shine and let God do the work if
[1:02:03] there is a seed on the inside of there
[1:02:05] and I believe there is if there is then
[1:02:08] God will Quicken
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:11] it you understand what I'm saying right
[1:02:14] we're not trying to you know another
[1:02:16] movement to where we're getting people
[1:02:18] with everybody's got to dress this way
[1:02:20] and do this listen when we speak of
[1:02:22] dress that's according to the word of
[1:02:23] God that's been restored to us the
[1:02:25] message of the hour did not all of a
[1:02:27] sudden it wasn't a it wasn't introducing
[1:02:30] of things that were new but the message
[1:02:32] of the hour is God himself the very
[1:02:36] intelligence of God come down in a
[1:02:39] prophetic Ministry to show you and I the
[1:02:42] Lin the ends that were laid loose down
[1:02:44] through the scriptures and it restores
[1:02:46] it it's not something new it's the
[1:02:48] loosening of the word and the veil upon
[1:02:52] the eyes of the people and you know what
[1:02:54] that does it has an anointing oting with
[1:02:56] it it has an anointing that brings
[1:02:58] confidence it brings strength because
[1:03:00] you're looking at an open book which is
[1:03:03] a mirror and you see yourself as God
[1:03:06] always saw
[1:03:07] yourself nothing brings strength like
[1:03:12] that my we could say amen and that'd be
[1:03:16] good but notice notice what he did by
[1:03:19] the washing of regeneration and renewing
[1:03:22] of the Holy Ghost let me go on not
[1:03:25] notice how R says this and I I ended
[1:03:27] with this the last time brother Ram says
[1:03:29] in God's gifts always find their place
[1:03:31] he said he come to redeem the whole
[1:03:34] creation and nothing could do it but God
[1:03:37] himself so God came to redeem the whole
[1:03:41] creation so that Redemption is not just
[1:03:44] of humanity but remember this Earth it's
[1:03:47] a redeemable attribute of God it's come
[1:03:50] through its water baptism it's come
[1:03:52] through that of the beginning of
[1:03:54] sanctification where the blood was
[1:03:56] spilled upon it it'll come it'll be a
[1:03:58] finishing of that sanctification as it
[1:04:00] goes all the way through the time of the
[1:04:02] Millennium and then here it will they'll
[1:04:05] come that it'll get its baptism of fire
[1:04:07] in the future home it's already it's a
[1:04:10] testimony but you see notice what God
[1:04:12] does God prepares the
[1:04:15] subjects he makes subjects ready for the
[1:04:18] place that he's
[1:04:22] preparing notice he come to redeem the
[1:04:25] whole creation and nothing could do it
[1:04:27] but God himself that's the reason that
[1:04:31] God does nothing outside of man he
[1:04:34] always works through a man because he
[1:04:37] had to use a man I want you to just lock
[1:04:39] on to that he always works through a man
[1:04:42] because he had to use a man God doesn't
[1:04:45] stop working through
[1:04:47] man is God's working he's still working
[1:04:51] in the agency even after a message has
[1:04:54] gone forth now that light has come and
[1:04:57] that light now moves through the body
[1:05:00] and it's the light of God it's God
[1:05:02] working through the agency of man that
[1:05:05] word because because without that we
[1:05:08] would be running with a message of
[1:05:10] somebody else but God sees fit that the
[1:05:13] message that we're to carry is not a
[1:05:15] message where our minds have been
[1:05:17] reprogrammed that's what denominations
[1:05:19] do they program a man to a certain way
[1:05:23] but that's not God's way God don't
[1:05:24] program man by their mind God his
[1:05:27] program is that his Spirit would dwell
[1:05:30] inside of you and I and it would be the
[1:05:32] holy ghost that would carry this word
[1:05:34] that's why though when the New Birth has
[1:05:36] come you are a witness you are a
[1:05:38] messenger of the same
[1:05:42] Covenant Hallelujah I think what greater
[1:05:45] of a witness that could be placed out
[1:05:47] there than a life that's been snatched
[1:05:49] out of the fire a life that God has
[1:05:52] totally cleaned that life up and God
[1:05:54] himself moved mes through that life and
[1:05:56] that vessel and it's
[1:05:58] undeniable it's
[1:06:01] God he always works through a man
[1:06:04] because he had to use a man a man is
[1:06:06] what he had to use to display look at
[1:06:09] this his attribute of savior he had to
[1:06:13] use a man in order to display that
[1:06:16] attribute of savior he couldn't use it
[1:06:18] he couldn't use a son couldn't use the
[1:06:20] Stars couldn't use the moon in order to
[1:06:22] display this attribute he took a man
[1:06:27] brother BR goes on to say he had to make
[1:06:29] him in his image make him something like
[1:06:31] him put him on free moral agency let him
[1:06:33] act any way he wanted to he could take
[1:06:36] his choice and he knew that that man by
[1:06:38] giving him his choice would fall so
[1:06:40] being that he had to do that he turns
[1:06:42] back around and makes the man a partner
[1:06:45] to him and does nothing except he does
[1:06:49] it through a
[1:06:51] man oh my the whole work of Redemption
[1:06:55] come
[1:06:56] by a
[1:06:57] man right but same I thought we were
[1:07:00] just reading God is our savior it is God
[1:07:03] he is our savior but he had to display
[1:07:06] that attribute through a man and that
[1:07:08] man is the man Christ
[1:07:11] Jesus and that didn't stop there the
[1:07:14] Bible said in Acts 1 verse one all great
[1:07:18] theopus all that Jesus began to do and
[1:07:22] the prophet picks it up in the token and
[1:07:24] says and continue continued to
[1:07:26] do and he says his death didn't stop him
[1:07:31] it was only the
[1:07:33] loosening now it's coming into the body
[1:07:36] and it's that same life that's
[1:07:38] working oh my the whole work of
[1:07:41] Redemption come by man death come by the
[1:07:43] first man life come by the second Adam
[1:07:45] there you are he does nothing because he
[1:07:48] had to use man for that then he uses a
[1:07:50] man to redeem back again so deity became
[1:07:55] become Jehovah he says or become a child
[1:07:59] he become in the form of sin that he
[1:08:02] might redeem The Sinner there's the
[1:08:03] whole thing I'll tell you you talking
[1:08:05] about humility right there almighty God
[1:08:09] the great deity he became a
[1:08:11] child God was able to seow condens sin
[1:08:16] in order to create a blood cell and wrap
[1:08:18] himself in it and then come forth God
[1:08:21] works through man so this is what I want
[1:08:25] to begin to just I want to just take
[1:08:27] from where we were at there and let just
[1:08:29] let's just move back into scripture here
[1:08:30] just a little bit as we're looking at
[1:08:33] this because when job was saying how
[1:08:35] save how savest thou him that hath no
[1:08:38] strength so how how can this be done
[1:08:41] unless it God be present to work through
[1:08:45] the
[1:08:46] man so it's God working through man
[1:08:49] notice in the Book of Judges chapter 2
[1:08:51] it says nevertheless the Lord raised up
[1:08:54] judges which delivered them out of the
[1:08:56] hand of those that spoiled them and when
[1:08:59] the Lord raised them up judges then the
[1:09:01] Lord was with the judge and delivered
[1:09:04] them out of the hand of their enemies
[1:09:07] all the days of the judge for it
[1:09:09] repented the Lord because of their
[1:09:11] groanings by reason of them that oppress
[1:09:14] them and Vex them now remember within
[1:09:17] this of the Book of Judges this was a
[1:09:20] you know a time that God would raise up
[1:09:22] as the scripture said judges and you'll
[1:09:25] see here in a moment in the scriptures
[1:09:27] where it is declared that God operated
[1:09:30] he worked through those vessels as
[1:09:33] saviors because Israel was in a
[1:09:37] situation of here they were you know
[1:09:39] where they were being oppressed and uh
[1:09:42] you know things were what belonged to
[1:09:44] them was not taken from them the things
[1:09:46] that that belonged to them uh the enemy
[1:09:49] just come in and take it you know and
[1:09:51] and they were just a a trodden people
[1:09:53] but they weren't always that way the
[1:09:55] only way that Israel came into this kind
[1:09:57] of a condition is when they got away
[1:10:00] from the word right right you know I
[1:10:03] I've mentioned this before but it's very
[1:10:06] very very key because in this book it's
[1:10:09] mentioned twice in the Book of Judges
[1:10:11] that every man did what was right in his
[1:10:14] own
[1:10:15] sight and when we look at that it's very
[1:10:18] clear because these are men that when
[1:10:21] you look in the Book of Judges the the
[1:10:24] word Moses is only only mentioned four
[1:10:26] times and you would think well why why
[1:10:28] do they have to mention Moses why why
[1:10:30] would they have because God when he gave
[1:10:32] the word to Moses he said I'll bring
[1:10:35] them out and take them in it's a full
[1:10:38] message when God restores to Israel when
[1:10:42] he restores them back it will be a
[1:10:44] fulfillment of Prophecy that even God
[1:10:47] spoke when they crossed the Red Sea and
[1:10:50] Moses spoke under prophecy of how God
[1:10:53] would plant them in the land it would be
[1:10:55] a planting by God with the spirit of God
[1:10:58] moving in them to seal 144,000 that then
[1:11:02] when it returns back in that time of the
[1:11:05] of the future home there will not be any
[1:11:08] tearing down it will not be any removing
[1:11:10] God's word is still in fulfillment
[1:11:13] tonight he's not forgotten One
[1:11:17] Promise Israel there was types where
[1:11:19] they were planted but then here Israel
[1:11:21] would go astray but God himself knows
[1:11:24] how to plant in the time and in the
[1:11:26] season of when his life is come into the
[1:11:29] body so notice God would operate through
[1:11:32] these judges and sometimes Within These
[1:11:34] judges you find how God would operate
[1:11:37] through the different ones but here's
[1:11:39] one thing that was always key within
[1:11:42] this God would raise up saviors by his
[1:11:46] word according to his word and it would
[1:11:48] be God working through them to prove his
[1:11:51] word and what he thought of his word
[1:11:56] toward
[1:11:57] Israel remember Israel was in the shape
[1:12:00] because they got away from the word
[1:12:02] little by little by little this is our
[1:12:05] Authority is staying with the word even
[1:12:08] when our even when we we we don't have
[1:12:10] any feelings about it but staying with
[1:12:12] the word of
[1:12:13] God come on can we Fellowship on that
[1:12:16] there's sometimes when we don't feel
[1:12:18] very spiritual sometimes in keeping
[1:12:20] parts of the word we don't feel
[1:12:22] spiritual and we've got to press Beyond
[1:12:25] the flesh we've got to press beyond the
[1:12:27] pressures press Beyond ourself
[1:12:30] Lord but his word if if was stand with
[1:12:34] that word then listen as we're standing
[1:12:36] with the word this is not the word of a
[1:12:38] man that will crumble and fail this word
[1:12:41] is thus saith the Lord and when we walk
[1:12:44] with thus sayith the Lord walls come
[1:12:47] down ahead of us God is a way maker when
[1:12:50] we stay with thus sayith the Lord cuz
[1:12:52] it's not about us it's god making a way
[1:12:55] for
[1:12:56] himself so notice in in in here even
[1:12:59] when God remember when he raised up
[1:13:00] Gideon this was a this was very much a
[1:13:03] great key when God would raise up Gideon
[1:13:06] remember Gideon didn't feel that he was
[1:13:07] worthy as a matter of fact Gideon was in
[1:13:09] his own self he was afraid right uh you
[1:13:13] know he had experienced that you know
[1:13:15] like you know shamgar had experienced
[1:13:17] many times the enemy coming in and
[1:13:20] taking what they had sown and and you
[1:13:23] know they had they had planted and
[1:13:25] watered it and about the time of harvest
[1:13:27] here the enemy would come in and brother
[1:13:30] BR begins to talk about how that Satan
[1:13:32] sometimes will do a family he said Satan
[1:13:34] will do a church sometimes he said but
[1:13:36] you know when shamgar had come into that
[1:13:39] place and he he remembered what he
[1:13:41] remembered was he remembered what he
[1:13:45] already
[1:13:47] was he did not become a son of Abraham
[1:13:50] with a covenant he already was a son of
[1:13:53] Abraham he already had a
[1:13:56] covenant sometimes friends that this is
[1:13:59] what the listen this is what the gospel
[1:14:01] is all about it's not bringing something
[1:14:04] new to you it's to reveal to you who you
[1:14:08] are what belongs to you the rights as a
[1:14:11] child of almighty God you've got a
[1:14:14] covenant as a son and daughter of
[1:14:16] almighty God you're not some trotting
[1:14:18] down nothing but you are a son and
[1:14:21] daughter of God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:25] this is what the word came to do is to
[1:14:28] minister a Salvation the word had
[1:14:31] already come through the prophet but the
[1:14:34] angel of the Lord that accompanied The
[1:14:35] Prophet's Ministry stayed after the
[1:14:38] prophet went off the scene and he found
[1:14:41] Gideon and when he found Gideon Gideon
[1:14:44] did not think he was anything different
[1:14:46] than just a
[1:14:47] man but when he began to deal with him
[1:14:50] he come to a place to finally Gideon had
[1:14:53] got to this place here when he makes a
[1:14:55] statement and you know here he is he's
[1:14:57] looking at himself wherewith shall I
[1:14:59] save
[1:15:01] Israel that's right you're looking at
[1:15:03] himself how can I how can I do this
[1:15:06] behold my family is poor in Manasseh and
[1:15:09] I'm the least in my father's house God's
[1:15:11] got to break the complex around his life
[1:15:14] because it's one thing to have humility
[1:15:16] and then it's another thing for a
[1:15:18] complex to get in the way of humility
[1:15:20] that will lower itself under the word of
[1:15:23] God and say be it unto me according to
[1:15:25] Thy word so God is a tremendous you get
[1:15:29] in the presence of God and God just his
[1:15:31] presence just opens up and what it's
[1:15:32] doing is it's taking everything away
[1:15:35] from our life is is's dismantled because
[1:15:38] we didn't understand it these are things
[1:15:41] sometimes I hope I can say this that
[1:15:43] sometimes my family is poor Manassa I'm
[1:15:45] the least in my father's house that
[1:15:47] almost comes back like lonus blanket
[1:15:49] with Charlie Brown it's become something
[1:15:51] like a bottle or Pacifier that we feel
[1:15:54] safe with but God wants to let us know
[1:15:57] no that was meant to hinder and injure
[1:15:59] you I am your savior you don't have to
[1:16:03] resort back to a hurt or a complex or
[1:16:05] something else I am your savior I'm
[1:16:08] greater than your family straight you're
[1:16:10] a part of me Gideon hallelujah
[1:16:15] hallelujah and the Lord said unto him
[1:16:18] surely I will be I will be with thee and
[1:16:22] thou shalt Smite the midianites as one
[1:16:26] man this was the key of God taking
[1:16:30] raising up to his word by his word
[1:16:34] saviors is it would be lives that would
[1:16:37] be one with his
[1:16:40] word and so God would operate with that
[1:16:43] Oneness through the man now watch this
[1:16:47] in the book of Nehemiah chapter n
[1:16:51] Nehemiah picks this up I love this
[1:16:53] nevertheless
[1:16:55] Nehemiah rehearsing this time we're
[1:16:56] talking of they were disobedient
[1:16:59] rebelled against thee talking about
[1:17:01] Israel cast thy law behind their backs
[1:17:03] slew thy prophets which testified
[1:17:05] against them to turn them to thee and
[1:17:07] they wrought great provocation they done
[1:17:10] enough to be
[1:17:13] defriended ohoo y'all this bring it down
[1:17:15] to present tense language is it they got
[1:17:18] enough to be drawn out of the
[1:17:21] circle is that right so they got a
[1:17:24] enough they got enough to receive you
[1:17:26] know silent treatment and it isn't that
[1:17:29] God himself when I want to say he was
[1:17:31] not silent in the way that we are silent
[1:17:34] but God was silent when they walked away
[1:17:37] from his word he is his word and there
[1:17:40] is no other voice but the
[1:17:42] word my sheep know my voice and a
[1:17:47] stranger they will not
[1:17:49] follow is that right so notice here
[1:17:53] therefore thou delivers them into the
[1:17:56] hand of their enemies who Vex them so
[1:17:58] God he delivered them he turned them
[1:18:00] over into the hand of their enemies but
[1:18:02] he never lost one
[1:18:05] right right and in the time of their
[1:18:08] trouble when they Cried unto thee thou
[1:18:11] Hest them from heaven and according to
[1:18:14] thy manifold mercies thou gavest them
[1:18:19] saviors who saved them out of the hand
[1:18:23] of their enemies who gave him saviors
[1:18:26] God gave him saviors because it's an
[1:18:28] attribute of
[1:18:30] himself that when lives would get in
[1:18:33] trouble when distress would come and
[1:18:35] when they would repent of their ways
[1:18:38] then God delivered a
[1:18:40] savior listen friends the same way with
[1:18:43] you and I when our lives and our heart
[1:18:45] got to a place to where God ministering
[1:18:48] to our lives to where it would bring us
[1:18:50] to a place to where of surrender and
[1:18:53] recognize we're nothing you watch the
[1:18:56] Savior manifest himself at that time
[1:18:59] he's not standing there to condemn but
[1:19:02] he's standing there after conviction has
[1:19:04] struck the heart of an individual that
[1:19:07] he stands there to minister to you and I
[1:19:09] I am your
[1:19:12] savior and God will take he'll always
[1:19:15] come in the form of his word he'll
[1:19:17] always save by his word so God will take
[1:19:20] whatever whatever he choose to take
[1:19:22] whatever text because there's not one
[1:19:24] more word God and another word not God
[1:19:26] the Bible said in the beginning was the
[1:19:29] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:19:31] Word was God so it's always God
[1:19:34] manifesting himself by his word now
[1:19:37] notice when Israel coming into this that
[1:19:39] like the scripture said they could they
[1:19:41] could fail they would they would fall
[1:19:43] back they would fall but all this was
[1:19:44] types that was laid all the way through
[1:19:46] there wish I could go through and just
[1:19:48] just begin to preach on some of them
[1:19:50] Esther and different ones but notice
[1:19:52] there was coming the promise of what God
[1:19:54] had promised for he said in Luke Chapter
[1:19:56] 2 for unto you is Born This Day in the
[1:20:00] city of David a savior which is Christ
[1:20:04] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[1:20:07] you you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[1:20:10] swaddling clothes laying in a Manger in
[1:20:14] Matthew 1:21 she shall bring forth a son
[1:20:17] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[1:20:22] he shall save his people from their sins
[1:20:27] you see what's he doing he's coming for
[1:20:29] his people with his mind on his
[1:20:32] Covenant this is why even when he
[1:20:35] descends in Revelations 10 with a little
[1:20:37] book open the rainbow about his head his
[1:20:40] mind is on his Covenant his word that's
[1:20:44] why that that that that this message and
[1:20:47] and and the coming of the Savior notice
[1:20:49] within it he shall save not his people
[1:20:53] in their sins but save them from their
[1:20:56] sins not in but from he's a
[1:21:00] deliverer this is the only one that not
[1:21:03] only can take all of the all of the
[1:21:06] condition away but he himself is able to
[1:21:09] minister the full strength of Salvation
[1:21:12] that deals with the very nature that
[1:21:14] caus man to do it in the first place he
[1:21:17] shall save his people from their sins oh
[1:21:22] elections all the way through the
[1:21:23] scriptures predestination all the way
[1:21:26] through the scriptures he came with a
[1:21:29] purpose oh my that's why this message
[1:21:32] it's a message of purpose it's not
[1:21:35] aimless wondering it's a message with a
[1:21:37] purpose we're looking at the coming of
[1:21:39] the Lord we're face to face with the
[1:21:42] Rapture it is a purpose the church is
[1:21:44] not aimlessly wandering with soup
[1:21:47] suppers and everything else we are
[1:21:49] purposeful for the coming of the Lord
[1:21:51] looking for that last one that's why we
[1:21:54] do what we do that's why we reach out
[1:21:57] that's why we encourage one another we
[1:21:59] are people with a vision and a purpose
[1:22:02] with the coming of the
[1:22:04] Lord and like Mori told Esther if you
[1:22:08] don't do it God will raise up
[1:22:11] deliverance from another
[1:22:14] area we have been
[1:22:17] mandated by the mighty
[1:22:21] Angel God help us amen
[1:22:26] now unto him look at the strength of
[1:22:27] this unto him that is able to keep you
[1:22:31] from falling and to present you
[1:22:33] faultless before the presence of his
[1:22:36] glory with exceeding Joy to the only
[1:22:39] wise God our savior be glory and majesty
[1:22:44] and dominion and power both now and ever
[1:22:47] amen now I want you to think of
[1:22:50] this here we just
[1:22:53] read of how God came down to display
[1:22:56] that attribute of savior he had to use a
[1:23:01] man to display that through now for that
[1:23:05] for God remember remember he's got to
[1:23:08] undo what was done in
[1:23:12] Eden remember what took place to fall in
[1:23:15] Eden this is why that even when you when
[1:23:17] you go to speak with others and you know
[1:23:20] sometimes you know it's always been been
[1:23:22] a struggle with people with serpent seed
[1:23:23] and it's really it's not among even
[1:23:25] amongst of the ancient rabbis but you
[1:23:27] find different ones and it comes down to
[1:23:30] this question why did it have to be a
[1:23:32] virgin
[1:23:33] birth that's just a question just you
[1:23:35] can drop that question and walk away why
[1:23:37] did it have to be a virgin why was that
[1:23:38] the
[1:23:40] specification why was it a virgin birth
[1:23:43] because it had to be separate from the
[1:23:47] sexual blood that was already
[1:23:51] polluted right this is why Peter calls
[1:23:54] it the blood of Christ right is that
[1:23:56] right this is why in The Book of
[1:23:58] Revelation it tells us that we have been
[1:24:00] loosed with a perfect uh perfect
[1:24:02] loosening through his
[1:24:04] blood and that it says in Hebrews 13
[1:24:08] that not like Abel's blood Abel's blood
[1:24:11] called out against Cain and said he's
[1:24:13] guilty he's guilty he did it he he's
[1:24:16] guilty but this
[1:24:18] Blood speaketh better things and the
[1:24:22] prophet picks it up in the token he said
[1:24:24] this blood does what Abel's blood
[1:24:27] couldn't do he said this Blood says you
[1:24:30] old Cain you've been a b make believer
[1:24:33] but why don't you come on over under the
[1:24:35] blood and I'll Transform you once and
[1:24:38] for
[1:24:39] all oh don't look at me funny you brush
[1:24:42] can's teeth you comb Cane's hair but on
[1:24:44] the inside there's an able that's
[1:24:48] able is that all right here we have this
[1:24:51] cane we got this Ishmael out here but on
[1:24:53] the inside is the child of the
[1:24:56] promis and it's the child of the promise
[1:24:58] that sometimes we've got to put this guy
[1:25:01] out and say you know what you're not
[1:25:02] going to sit here and torment me this
[1:25:04] way you're not just going to take in
[1:25:06] every little thing but we're I'm putting
[1:25:08] what are you doing I'm silencing your
[1:25:11] voice oh my you realize that was an
[1:25:14] authority that Sarah came to Sarah came
[1:25:17] to that place of an authority not not
[1:25:19] disregarding her husband she wasn't she
[1:25:22] wasn't a dominating female that was
[1:25:24] under sari but once the word had come
[1:25:26] and God had breathed upon her life and
[1:25:29] changed her life when the word came
[1:25:31] forth through her life then Sarah came
[1:25:33] to a place and she realized when she saw
[1:25:36] ishmail taunting Isaac she's the one
[1:25:39] that told Abraham Abraham break away
[1:25:42] from just your human compassion and
[1:25:44] remember be tied to the word he cannot
[1:25:47] go on with the son of the promise said
[1:25:50] brother Samy you you're paraphrasing
[1:25:52] adding words I I'm I am but I'm not you
[1:25:55] you get what I'm actually saying she
[1:25:57] spoke with authority that was speaking
[1:25:59] to when the bride you and I as the Bride
[1:26:02] of Jesus Christ begin to recognize the
[1:26:04] things that are around my life that's
[1:26:06] hindering that's tormenting that's
[1:26:08] dragging down the child of the promise I
[1:26:11] put it out of the
[1:26:13] camp it can't be in my camp in my life
[1:26:16] any longer it's hindering it's hindering
[1:26:21] Isaac thank Hallelujah
[1:26:26] oh my now think of this God used a
[1:26:29] channel by the name of Mary brother Bram
[1:26:32] says it like this and God's gifts always
[1:26:34] find their places same message he said
[1:26:36] Mary the mother of Jesus in the city of
[1:26:38] Nazareth the meanest City there was in
[1:26:40] the land but out of there God chose a
[1:26:42] little lady to give birth to his son an
[1:26:45] incubator a womb a baby had to be born
[1:26:48] by he took such a pro person to do it
[1:26:51] God works through human beings to redeem
[1:26:56] human
[1:26:58] beings he can take you work through you
[1:27:02] to redeem Humanity if you'll completely
[1:27:05] dedicate everything you
[1:27:07] are God works through human beings in
[1:27:10] order to redeem human beings remember
[1:27:13] like the extension CT we don't pack it's
[1:27:15] not us it's the it's not us that that
[1:27:18] causes the electricity but we just want
[1:27:20] to be hooked up to the source because if
[1:27:22] you're not hooked up to the source you
[1:27:24] cannot impart
[1:27:26] electricity right if you get a little
[1:27:28] short along the way something comes up
[1:27:30] unconfessed sin or get a grievance or
[1:27:32] Grudge or what more it'll Kink it right
[1:27:35] but this is where there's got to be that
[1:27:36] repair why so the channel can
[1:27:39] flow now watch brother BR says if you're
[1:27:42] a young woman dedicate your morals if
[1:27:45] you're a young man dedicate your morals
[1:27:47] dedicate your mind dedicate your
[1:27:49] thinking dedicate your heart dedicate
[1:27:52] your soul dedicate all you are and let
[1:27:55] Christ work through that what a glorious
[1:27:59] thing yes amen
[1:28:03] listen well I I I'll go down another
[1:28:06] pathway it'll be another be another
[1:28:07] service but we want to we want to
[1:28:10] dedicate dedicate all that we are giving
[1:28:12] ourselves to him daily Moment by moment
[1:28:16] even in our
[1:28:17] mind sometimes you wonder why the things
[1:28:20] sometimes in our mind and we can search
[1:28:21] back but if we just look and say God let
[1:28:23] my mind be filled with the things of God
[1:28:26] I know we have our jobs we have other
[1:28:27] things but you know sometimes If we're
[1:28:29] honest sometimes we we can allow things
[1:28:31] either of the job or happenings of the
[1:28:34] family and other things we can allow it
[1:28:35] to dwell instead of taking all of that
[1:28:38] and committing it to him is that right
[1:28:41] then sometimes there can be things on
[1:28:43] our mind of of this to take our mind and
[1:28:46] you know it can be pleasure and other
[1:28:48] things else but remember if we'll
[1:28:50] dedicate our mind I tell you if we can
[1:28:52] just take that part of it dedicating our
[1:28:54] mind you'll watch the we'll watch the
[1:28:55] effect of it through every other area of
[1:28:57] our life because the word it enters in
[1:29:01] through the Mind first and it's not
[1:29:04] positive thoughts it's the positive word
[1:29:06] coming in the channel of our mind and
[1:29:08] it's the word that has life in
[1:29:10] it so the Greater Works this is what
[1:29:13] we're we're talking about the Greater
[1:29:14] Works this is what was promised to the
[1:29:17] Church of the Living God remember Jesus
[1:29:19] said verily verily I say unto you he
[1:29:21] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:29:23] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:29:26] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:29:29] father brother Braham comes into that
[1:29:31] day on Calvary he said the Greater Works
[1:29:34] was to have the power in the church not
[1:29:36] only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out
[1:29:40] Devils by prayer but to impart eternal
[1:29:43] life to Believers the Holy Ghost was
[1:29:46] coming and giv into the hands of the
[1:29:48] church to impart life that's what
[1:29:51] Calvary meant
[1:29:54] he says watch this this is powerful he
[1:29:56] took stoop degraded men and women and
[1:30:00] lifted them into a place to be Sons and
[1:30:02] Daughters of God to heal the sick to
[1:30:05] impart eternal life by giving the Holy
[1:30:08] Ghost to obedient Believers men who were
[1:30:10] once unbelievers be made Believers and
[1:30:13] impart spiritual eternal
[1:30:16] life now when brother R speaks of this
[1:30:19] this isn't me or you going up to
[1:30:21] somebody else and say I give you eternal
[1:30:24] life there's a
[1:30:26] prescription brother B goes into this
[1:30:28] same message and he said this is where
[1:30:30] the Catholic Church got off where where
[1:30:33] they themselves begin to take whosoever
[1:30:35] sins you remit to them are remitted
[1:30:37] whosoever sin you retain to them that
[1:30:39] are retained he said that's the truth
[1:30:41] but where the Catholics got off is they
[1:30:44] said I forgive your sins right a church
[1:30:48] can't forgive
[1:30:49] sins God is the savior it's God who
[1:30:53] pardons it's God who
[1:30:56] forgives the church is only an agency
[1:31:00] that points to a finished work and that
[1:31:03] heart recognizes that there has already
[1:31:06] come a sin
[1:31:08] Bearer for me he was
[1:31:11] crucified for me he suffered for me he
[1:31:14] bled and died for me he raised up on
[1:31:17] that Easter morning for me he ascended
[1:31:20] on high and for me he sent back the Holy
[1:31:23] Ghost
[1:31:25] and so that imparting of Life comes
[1:31:28] through the word how is that repent and
[1:31:32] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:36] for the remission of your sins Our
[1:31:39] Savior that's the Greater Works because
[1:31:42] brother BR points it out he says you
[1:31:44] could pray for the sick and the sick be
[1:31:46] healed but he said that's not the that's
[1:31:47] not what the scripture was promised of
[1:31:49] the Greater Works the Greater Works was
[1:31:52] that life
[1:31:54] that eternal life that would pass
[1:31:56] through the
[1:31:57] body this is this it was God's own life
[1:32:00] this is why friends that that life
[1:32:02] itself that the Holy Ghost Jesus said
[1:32:05] that the Holy Ghost he said the father
[1:32:07] would give it in my name it comes
[1:32:11] through the ministering of the word
[1:32:14] listen when I say even the ministering
[1:32:16] word a person can be setting and can be
[1:32:18] you know reading can be listening even
[1:32:20] into the message and reading and here
[1:32:22] they are they're they're in tuneing and
[1:32:23] uity with God I got many examples I
[1:32:25] could go into that the prophet pulls
[1:32:27] from but what it is is they've made
[1:32:29] contact with God in a personal
[1:32:32] way and this is why it can't be another
[1:32:35] Jesus because God God doesn't want us to
[1:32:37] take a name of a fallen condition right
[1:32:41] he don't want us to take the name
[1:32:42] Baptist that's a fallen woman he don't
[1:32:44] want us to take the name Pentecostal
[1:32:46] that's a fallen because when Eve she got
[1:32:49] the name Eve is when she had already
[1:32:51] fallen but God was God's desire is that
[1:32:53] we would bear His Image his likeness and
[1:32:57] it's him operating through his body it's
[1:33:01] him that was even telling as this life
[1:33:03] was moving it was him that even told
[1:33:06] Phillip when here in Samaria think about
[1:33:09] this Philip has ministered here in
[1:33:11] Samaria demons have been cast out the
[1:33:14] sick had been
[1:33:16] healed these people they were in a place
[1:33:20] they were ripe for the Holy Ghost to
[1:33:22] fall and God picks Phillip up and takes
[1:33:25] him down there to Samaria takes him down
[1:33:28] there to join to this unic right I
[1:33:31] believe Samar I believe I got that right
[1:33:33] I may but you you understand what I'm
[1:33:34] saying he takes him to join him down
[1:33:36] there but notice God brings Peter and
[1:33:39] them down from Jerusalem and Peter and
[1:33:42] them lay hands on them and they received
[1:33:44] the Holy Ghost it wasn't that Peter was
[1:33:48] the only extension cord he was a part
[1:33:51] and tapped into the body but God was
[1:33:54] showing in that it's not a Onan
[1:33:58] Ministry any longer it is a body it is a
[1:34:03] oneman Ministry in terms of there is one
[1:34:06] man by this man Christ Jesus it's a
[1:34:09] oneman Ministry in that God sends a
[1:34:13] message to an age and the people of that
[1:34:15] age are birthed under the light of that
[1:34:18] word and it's Christ that is flowing
[1:34:21] through the body Hallelujah
[1:34:24] absolutely listen the word has an
[1:34:28] effect the word won't return
[1:34:31] void this is aware that within
[1:34:34] it I want you to think of this here with
[1:34:37] Rahab I'm going to I'm going to close on
[1:34:40] this I want you to think with Rahab here
[1:34:42] for a
[1:34:44] moment I want you to think what she
[1:34:47] did the prophet
[1:34:50] said she made her house a place to
[1:34:54] receive the
[1:34:55] message now brother Brandon wasn't just
[1:34:57] speaking there if we read the full quote
[1:35:00] brother Brandon was not speaking there
[1:35:02] that she just became somebody who would
[1:35:04] just playing tapes in her house but he's
[1:35:06] he's bringing it down she made her house
[1:35:10] a dwelling place to receive the message
[1:35:13] because it's got to go more than just
[1:35:15] around you remember the prophet said
[1:35:18] just to be around it is not enough
[1:35:21] you've got to come under it it's got to
[1:35:24] come in you is that right now then then
[1:35:28] we become Witnesses of that same
[1:35:29] Covenant and I want you to think it was
[1:35:31] revealed I want you to watch this this
[1:35:33] scarlet cord Remember When when when
[1:35:36] when the spies came in she was
[1:35:38] testifying to them her faith had already
[1:35:41] been built right by what hearing the
[1:35:44] word of God just hearing the word what
[1:35:47] God was doing hey you think it ain't
[1:35:50] powerful sometimes listen sometimes
[1:35:52] friends we can miss
[1:35:54] the very channels that God wants to do
[1:35:56] sometimes and please understand me we
[1:35:59] want to get people we want to get to
[1:36:00] that place of Acts 238 but remember but
[1:36:03] sometimes before you can get to acts 238
[1:36:06] you you've got to take what Jesus said
[1:36:08] when John was there and his eyes was all
[1:36:10] skimmed over and he said go tell John
[1:36:12] what you see being
[1:36:14] done sometimes it's just the testimony
[1:36:16] what is it that would build the faith in
[1:36:18] the meetings where many would be
[1:36:20] testifying of things you know and how
[1:36:23] God was working and they were seeing
[1:36:24] things and meeting and then the word was
[1:36:26] coming the same word now as the word
[1:36:28] would be ministering it was the word
[1:36:31] that was bringing the people off the Cs
[1:36:33] as they received it it was the word that
[1:36:35] was dissolving cancer and as that word
[1:36:37] was going forth RAB received that word
[1:36:41] and she said I know that the Lord had
[1:36:42] given you the land in other words here
[1:36:45] we are I I'm living in the walls of
[1:36:47] judgment and I can't get
[1:36:50] out this is a walled City
[1:36:53] and I've heard the sound of the trumpet
[1:36:56] but I need to get out of here I've only
[1:36:58] got so much time that I can get out of
[1:37:00] this walled City see I I've heard the
[1:37:03] Jubilee she said but I can't get out of
[1:37:05] it on my own but see she heard a word
[1:37:08] that brought faith that irregardless of
[1:37:11] her situation and the conditions of life
[1:37:15] I want you to understand what these
[1:37:17] Brethren with a revelation they went
[1:37:21] into her home
[1:37:24] something that was there in her
[1:37:28] possession all
[1:37:30] along but she hadn't realized it and it
[1:37:34] hadn't been put in its proper
[1:37:37] place that's what the message of the
[1:37:39] Hour come to do it's not a new Bible but
[1:37:43] it brings to the realization of what has
[1:37:46] always laid here and guides it to be
[1:37:50] placed properly that judgment that fear
[1:37:53] is passed away from our hearts and when
[1:37:56] the word the realization because what
[1:37:58] brings realization the holy ghost coming
[1:38:02] the Life coming upon that word brings a
[1:38:05] realization and begins to break back the
[1:38:08] veils and scales upon the life and then
[1:38:11] we can
[1:38:12] see it's him I was always a part of him
[1:38:17] and then here we take of that word and
[1:38:20] now we see how to apply that word that
[1:38:22] it's more than just healing the sick
[1:38:24] it's more than just the dead being
[1:38:25] raised but now Has Come For Life that'll
[1:38:28] seal us into the
[1:38:31] body
[1:38:34] amen oh my listen friends I'm not
[1:38:37] against signs and wonders but the bride
[1:38:39] of Christ is not following that signs
[1:38:41] and wonders is not a sign of of the
[1:38:44] Bride of Jesus Christ signs and wonders
[1:38:47] follow them that believe and there's
[1:38:50] always been a part of it that sometimes
[1:38:51] with Even in our Humanity of human
[1:38:53] nature we've seen it through the years
[1:38:55] those of you that are much older than me
[1:38:57] you would have somebody that would you
[1:38:58] know raise up and somebody you know they
[1:39:01] would say something and do something and
[1:39:03] you know and uh you know wanting to say
[1:39:05] something about somebody or whatever and
[1:39:07] all of a sudden then you'd have people
[1:39:08] running after them and running after
[1:39:11] this one and running it's why because
[1:39:13] there's a part within that of sometimes
[1:39:15] of that Humanity that's drawn to the
[1:39:18] supernatural but God brings us see in
[1:39:20] this hour we're living in we realize
[1:39:22] beloved believe not every
[1:39:25] Spirit but try it whether it be of God
[1:39:29] is will it stay with the word of God
[1:39:32] will it stay because this is what this
[1:39:33] is our safety is to stay with the word
[1:39:37] of God that's our safety is that right
[1:39:41] that's why Paul Paul even said he said
[1:39:43] I'm not your safety the Revelation is if
[1:39:46] I or an angel am come from heaven and
[1:39:50] say anything different than what's
[1:39:53] already been said let him be a
[1:39:55] cursed this is why Paul could go on to
[1:39:58] say with such Authority If any man think
[1:40:01] himself to be a prophet preacher or
[1:40:03] spiritual spirit filled let him
[1:40:06] acknowledge that the things that I have
[1:40:08] Wroten unto you are the Commandments of
[1:40:10] the
[1:40:11] Lord
[1:40:13] amen this is why back in the days of
[1:40:15] Paul any man that would want to try to
[1:40:17] say well you know this is Paul's opinion
[1:40:20] it was just tuned out tuned out that's
[1:40:23] that's why when the the Ephesian
[1:40:24] believers they tried them as false
[1:40:26] Apostles and the prophet said how did
[1:40:27] they try them by being false Apostles
[1:40:29] they tried them by the word and they
[1:40:30] said you're not saying what Paul said
[1:40:34] right right glory be to God oh my so
[1:40:37] notice Let me just let me just close on
[1:40:40] this one Statue of a perfect man
[1:40:43] remember that virtue look how brother
[1:40:45] brand says this if I'm going to be like
[1:40:47] Jesus I've got to have virtue and a pass
[1:40:53] that it can pass forward from me to the
[1:40:58] people I've got to have a pass I've got
[1:41:01] to have that token I've got to have that
[1:41:03] life I've got to have that because that
[1:41:06] is all the virtue and allows it to pass
[1:41:09] to
[1:41:10] others and you know sometimes you you
[1:41:13] might look and you might think well what
[1:41:16] what can I do but brother Brown says he
[1:41:19] goes on to say it like this he says what
[1:41:21] if someone tried to draw virtue out of
[1:41:23] us and the check would return
[1:41:26] insufficient funds not there to draw
[1:41:29] from the check bounced somebody looking
[1:41:31] at you as a Christian and tomorrow see
[1:41:33] you out here carrying on like a sinner
[1:41:35] he said there's not much virtue can be
[1:41:37] drawn from that so sometimes the virtue
[1:41:40] that's being drawn is not altogether
[1:41:42] what we're
[1:41:43] saying it's our
[1:41:46] life that's virtue that constant
[1:41:49] steadiness look sometimes you you you
[1:41:52] might look and think about with with
[1:41:53] your children your family your loved
[1:41:55] ones your co-workers and it might seem
[1:41:58] like nothing's getting
[1:42:00] through it might seem like nothing's
[1:42:02] making a
[1:42:05] difference let me give you two
[1:42:08] examples brother brandham takes that
[1:42:11] little
[1:42:12] woman and he gives this story in many
[1:42:15] places in the
[1:42:17] message she God had done a work in her
[1:42:19] life but her husband was a drunk
[1:42:23] and they got down at the
[1:42:24] bar and these guys that were down there
[1:42:27] at the bar said there ain't no such
[1:42:28] thing as a real Christian
[1:42:32] right and he said at about that time
[1:42:34] that man raised up and said oh yes there
[1:42:37] is I know one ah there ain't no such
[1:42:40] thing as that he said yes I know one my
[1:42:43] wife brother brand pauses there he said
[1:42:45] see he said here she was at home
[1:42:50] thinking it wasn't getting through right
[1:42:54] brother Bram goes into that house
[1:42:55] shooting because what what what happens
[1:42:57] if we feel like something's not getting
[1:42:58] over you get
[1:43:00] discouraged you almost feel like just
[1:43:02] you know let's let's fold in the you
[1:43:04] know nobody's passing by in the flea
[1:43:05] market to buy anything let's just fold
[1:43:06] up the tables and go eat hot dogs or
[1:43:08] something you know let's just fold it up
[1:43:10] but brother Bram said see he says
[1:43:12] brother Bram applies that to zakus and
[1:43:17] Elizabeth he said when zakus got to be
[1:43:19] the most irritable he said that was the
[1:43:21] sign that God was dealing with with
[1:43:25] him and then brother Bram you know you
[1:43:27] know what happens with that story then
[1:43:28] brother Bram himself comes to that place
[1:43:30] in his own life where he felt like the
[1:43:33] message it's not getting acrossed it's
[1:43:35] not being received and brother R will
[1:43:37] take that same example and say he was
[1:43:40] contacted by Brother Williams out of
[1:43:42] after a full gospel businessman's
[1:43:44] meeting where a man had got up and begin
[1:43:47] to dispute things that brother brandham
[1:43:49] was ministering and he said the people
[1:43:52] and at that moment he said they just
[1:43:55] they froze and he said brother Williams
[1:43:58] came up behind that man and he
[1:44:00] said this is not how we heard brother
[1:44:04] brandham teach it and he said how many
[1:44:07] brother William said when he me made
[1:44:08] that statement after that man had left
[1:44:11] and or the man had walked off the stage
[1:44:12] he said how many of you'd like brother
[1:44:13] brand to come back out here in Arizona
[1:44:15] and to minister and lay these things
[1:44:17] back out he said brother brandom he said
[1:44:19] I had $100 bills I had $20 bills being
[1:44:22] laid in my hand right there to get your
[1:44:24] ticket to bring you back out here and
[1:44:26] brother Braham said think of it when it
[1:44:28] when I thought nobody's listening to me
[1:44:31] nobody's hearing it but God was working
[1:44:34] on the time so sometimes even in this
[1:44:36] here as a savior God help us to be
[1:44:39] faithful help us to be faithful when it
[1:44:41] seems like we're seems like we're up
[1:44:43] against a brick wall but remember it's
[1:44:46] not you that liveth it's Christ and
[1:44:49] sometimes in those times that God has it
[1:44:51] it's just us being tempered it's us just
[1:44:53] being molded into a place for God to
[1:44:56] further use and work through our lives I
[1:44:59] tell you we want to be that kind of a
[1:45:01] channel that the virtue of the Holy
[1:45:04] Spirit can flow through don't you we've
[1:45:07] got we got one example we got one one
[1:45:10] one uh purpose and that is Lord you know
[1:45:13] let's find that last one and as we're
[1:45:16] working to find that last one say God
[1:45:20] help me let me just be as a channel that
[1:45:23] you know to help somebody else along the
[1:45:26] way to encourage somebody else along
[1:45:28] Give me the give me the wisdom Lord
[1:45:30] whether it's something I need to say or
[1:45:32] it's a time to listen maybe even in your
[1:45:34] family is it a time to listen is it a
[1:45:36] time to speak God let give me the wisdom
[1:45:39] on what's needed right now and that's
[1:45:42] something that if Bill that if job's
[1:45:44] friends would have leaned on God for
[1:45:47] discernment within that instead of their
[1:45:49] knowledge of of the word if they would
[1:45:51] have leaned on God then God God himself
[1:45:55] I believe God can give the discernment
[1:45:57] and give us the strength I don't I'm not
[1:45:59] going to say that they would have come
[1:46:00] and give job the answers because God was
[1:46:03] building job's faith and his trust was
[1:46:07] solid within God because at the end of
[1:46:10] it all God lets job know I've been
[1:46:14] working the whole
[1:46:15] time but Lord I want to be a faithful
[1:46:17] Channel don't
[1:46:19] you if there's anything about me Lord
[1:46:21] any complex or things that Lord would be
[1:46:24] Lord just just dissolve it Lord dissolve
[1:46:26] anything out of my life that Lord would
[1:46:28] would be Hance guide me and show me and
[1:46:30] brother BR says as you are one with that
[1:46:32] word and you apply it the simple
[1:46:35] applying of the word you know our our
[1:46:37] simple daily walk with God you know the
[1:46:39] applying when we talk about applying the
[1:46:41] blood it it's simply taking the word
[1:46:44] daily in our lives it's through things
[1:46:47] even as we think about we embark on this
[1:46:50] new year that we have before us it's a
[1:46:53] time that to look and say Lord I want to
[1:46:56] be closer to you this year than what I
[1:46:58] was last year I want I want more of you
[1:47:01] Lord I want more of your life less of me
[1:47:04] in this year I want to be closer Lord
[1:47:06] and just the applying of the word
[1:47:09] through prayer through just even just
[1:47:13] taking the word just even on a daily a
[1:47:16] daily basis friends just getting into
[1:47:18] the scriptures on a daily basis you
[1:47:20] don't have to become a scholar
[1:47:23] but just get into the word of God it's
[1:47:26] just even if it's just just reading a
[1:47:29] chapter a day it's just getting into the
[1:47:31] word of God just even even when it comes
[1:47:33] to the message just it's it's not about
[1:47:35] you know don't don't set you know
[1:47:37] sometimes we can set such goals that are
[1:47:39] unattainable but just just a little bit
[1:47:41] just even if you do a little bit and you
[1:47:43] find what'll happen it'll just continue
[1:47:44] to build and build and build and build
[1:47:47] and build all of us have different time
[1:47:49] schedules is that right so we can't look
[1:47:52] at it all all through the same lens but
[1:47:54] the main thing of it is is that Lord I
[1:47:56] want to apply that word to my life I
[1:48:00] want that word applied in my life
[1:48:01] because that word it has power within it
[1:48:04] it has power to change that same word
[1:48:07] has the authority that brought Rahab to
[1:48:09] the place to realize what was in her
[1:48:13] possession don't you love him showed her
[1:48:16] how to apply it he's the same God
[1:48:19] tonight amen let's just bow our heads in
[1:48:21] a word of Prayer heavly
[1:48:24] father Lord You're mindful of our needs
[1:48:27] Lord father even to deliver of your word
[1:48:31] in this generation Lord God to minister
[1:48:35] Lord salvation to our souls
[1:48:39] Lord oh God how we we thank you Lord for
[1:48:44] every every prayer for every sick that
[1:48:48] has been
[1:48:49] answered we thank you for that Lord we
[1:48:51] thank you for every every Mir Miracle
[1:48:54] God for the dead that's been raised Lord
[1:48:56] for cancers Lord that's been removed how
[1:48:59] we lord I I just rejoice in that Lord I
[1:49:04] rejoice in that Lord if it was a lord it
[1:49:06] it happened to Lord upon some and they
[1:49:09] never even went on maybe to serve you I
[1:49:11] know that that's a dangerous thing
[1:49:14] because Lord is you said in your word go
[1:49:16] and sin no more un L A worst thing come
[1:49:19] on you but father even how that you
[1:49:22] would would so provide with the desire
[1:49:25] to see Humanity be well that you know
[1:49:27] some Lord would never believe in Divine
[1:49:30] Healing and you'd provide that God you
[1:49:33] would allow doctors to be able to tap
[1:49:36] into a portion and tap into that Lord
[1:49:39] God and Father be able Lord through
[1:49:41] different things of medicines and
[1:49:43] ointments and surgeries and no wonder
[1:49:46] your Prophet Lord would tell us that
[1:49:48] dear God you perform Miracles through
[1:49:51] surgery Lord You Lord It's You Lord that
[1:49:56] is our healer Lord father no more than
[1:49:59] one man can save another man father
[1:50:01] there's no man that can heal another man
[1:50:04] Lord you are that you are and you alone
[1:50:08] are our healer Lord and so father we
[1:50:11] thank you for all of these things Lord
[1:50:14] just your goodness Lord to Lord to
[1:50:16] suffering Humanity but Lord I'm thankful
[1:50:20] that there's a there's a greater work
[1:50:23] there's a greater Lord a greater uh
[1:50:26] reality that comes into the heart of the
[1:50:28] believer of what Calvary made a way for
[1:50:31] Lord that father that
[1:50:33] we who were once separated alienated in
[1:50:38] our minds by Wicked Works Lord father
[1:50:41] Heaven our nature was contrary but
[1:50:44] father through and by like we read that
[1:50:46] scripture for when the love and kindness
[1:50:49] of God our savior toward man appeared
[1:50:52] not of works of righteousness which we
[1:50:54] have done but according to his Mercy he
[1:50:57] has saved us and washed us with the
[1:51:00] washing of regeneration and renewing of
[1:51:04] the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus we are your
[1:51:08] workmanship Lord there's nothing Lord I
[1:51:12] I'm so glad every time Lord that myself
[1:51:14] or someone else Lord that's been sick
[1:51:17] I'm so glad when you have touched them
[1:51:19] Lord I'm glad Lord the times when I've
[1:51:22] been sick Lord I'm so glad oh God for
[1:51:24] your healing
[1:51:26] touch but Lord I've experienced it and
[1:51:29] so of each one of us of what it means to
[1:51:32] be healed in one area and then we find
[1:51:36] Lord here we are battling maybe in
[1:51:38] another area Lord we're healed of a
[1:51:40] sinus infection and then here we are
[1:51:43] battling with a cold but father it just
[1:51:46] shows that this this life in this life
[1:51:50] we have no continuing City this life is
[1:51:54] really not about this
[1:51:56] life this life is the
[1:52:00] opportunity to make ready for that
[1:52:04] life which is beyond this life Lord and
[1:52:08] that's why David under inspiration could
[1:52:10] write thy loving kindness is better than
[1:52:15] life Lord thy loving kindness is your
[1:52:18] mercy is your
[1:52:20] life that God that you would come and
[1:52:23] you would do a work in our lives in our
[1:52:27] hearts God you would bring us to a
[1:52:30] place melt down our
[1:52:33] will oh
[1:52:36] God to a place of
[1:52:40] surrender your love your kindness and
[1:52:42] then you step in in that moment Lord of
[1:52:46] surrender and you completely change our
[1:52:50] lives you bring Lord the healing to that
[1:52:54] soul that can never ever be
[1:52:58] reversed there's a healing that comes
[1:53:01] into that soul that changes us Lord we
[1:53:04] pass from Death unto
[1:53:05] life like we're looking on Sunday we
[1:53:08] become a living miracle in our lives
[1:53:12] that's the greatest Miracle there is
[1:53:14] Lord for once that soul that was sinick
[1:53:19] has been healed it can never never ever
[1:53:23] be sick
[1:53:24] again but Lord sometimes Lord how the
[1:53:28] enemy will come in these bodies and like
[1:53:31] your Prophet said that he said Satan
[1:53:33] would look at these bodies and say well
[1:53:36] I I can't get to them seemingly in their
[1:53:38] soul but I'm going to afflict their body
[1:53:41] and we know he has to get permission he
[1:53:43] can't do anything unless he gets
[1:53:45] permission he had to get permission from
[1:53:48] you in order to touch job so Lord when
[1:53:50] we can look at the circumstances that
[1:53:52] are are present that we are standing
[1:53:54] in Satan has had to get
[1:53:57] permission we're under your
[1:54:01] care that's why even as you stood here
[1:54:05] in the body of your
[1:54:07] son you spoke there to Pontius pilot and
[1:54:11] said you could have no power over me
[1:54:15] except it be given unto you for my
[1:54:17] Father which is above Lord then there's
[1:54:20] nothing that can happen to us nothing
[1:54:22] can take place unless Satan has first
[1:54:27] got
[1:54:28] permission and then Lord when that
[1:54:31] permission is granted like he
[1:54:34] told him concerning job you can touch
[1:54:38] everything else but you can't touch his
[1:54:41] life and father I'm so thankful Lord
[1:54:45] that there is a life on the
[1:54:49] inside oh God A Life That's not like
[1:54:52] Paul could say it's not I that liveth
[1:54:54] but Christ that liveth in me I pray that
[1:54:56] God throughout this congregation tonight
[1:54:59] Lord those that would be streaming or
[1:55:01] those that would hear it Lord oh God may
[1:55:04] that be the testimony may that be the
[1:55:06] raise of the S so that would soak Lord
[1:55:09] into every heart and every life that
[1:55:12] Lord if if they never experienced to
[1:55:13] that depth Lord may they just Lord Just
[1:55:16] Surrender their hearts and say Lord I I
[1:55:18] want that depth in my life Lord I I want
