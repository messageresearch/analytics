say I know on behalf of uh brother joshu and sister Sharon they wish to uh say thank you uh for yesterday and that uh the baby shower that was was put on and for all that were able to be there they certainly want to extend their thanks uh to you for that and um so it's just a few weeks away right brother joshu so my my just so thankful to the Lord for his mercy and um you know uh Every Time I Think of uh see brother joshu and now the testimony that uh he he shared here with us and um that some months ago and my just you just see The Sovereign hand of God you know and that's really you know all of us come you know in all different circumstances and things but if not if it had not been for the mercy of God for each of our lives and I'm so thankful that God watches over his seed aren't you I'm so thankful for that amen so we want to just go right into the word and this morning and I want to say it's good to have brother Ivon and sister Linda here with us amen again and I was so tempted to have brother Ivon to speak but he said he was on vacation I I understand that I understand that I so I I value those times as well but we so appreciate having them here with us and if there's any other visitors here God bless you and God bless you sir amen good to have you amen let's go here in the word thank you musicians I want to read here just um just a few places just a couple scriptures here in Ruth chapter 2 and I want to move forward into some places here in Ruth's life here this morning just some things the Lord just really has uh just pressed on our hearts as well in Ruth uh chapter 2 verse 15 and 16 we'll just read those two verses and let you be seated and the scripture said and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean among the sheaves and reproach her not and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated and I I want to just speak here this morning on just that of the handfuls of purpose and I want to read a scripture here uh in Leviticus chapter 19 uh we have it there on the board and this was a law that God had given when they would go in and begin to reap in the the land or to harvest and to gather in the Harvest from the crops that they uh had sowed and I want you to notice as it's read uh read read here or wrote when ye reap the Harvest of your land this is instruction to those who are harvesting it Thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy Harvest and thou shalt not glean thy Vineyard neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy Vineyard Thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger I am the Lord your God God would even ask Israel uh this is really a whole separate thought but God would ask even he wants even what he has done for Israel God wanted Israel to even be a display of an extension of his Mercy to others and so I think that's the same thing that when we have received of the grace of God it's something that burns in our heart that we it just we want to that same grace extended to someone else we want to see that what God has done for us to be able to express that to someone else and say hey he did it for me he can do it for you and so when we look at that God's God always he wants to reflect himself through his people and that's truly the only the only ones that he can really reflect himself through we don't want to just he don't want to just reflect a portion but he wants to to reflect himself fully and Jo this would just be one of the attributes but I read that in regards to when Boaz in our text when Boaz had mentioned to the young men at that time and he told told them let her glean among the Sheep she being that of a stranger she would not have been allowed to glean among the sheep and then not only within that remember he said don't reproach her don't rebuke her for that I want you to I want you to allow her to do that and so so Ruth was not going to be confined to just the edges and what was you know just leftovers but I want her in the middle of the field I want her where the Harvest is going on sheaves that are being uh are are are there I want her to gather among those sheep and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her now there's a lot of other maidens that are in the field but notice Boaz as we have read from the beginning of this scripture or chapter Boaz has already taken notice of her and now she is not aware of this conversation but here he himself is saying let handfuls of purpose fall for her and leave them that she glean them and rebuke her not now I tell you that's quite something because you know with the handfuls of purpose bohas could have just packed everything up and said Ruth just go ahead and just you don't need to labor you don't need to do anything you know I'll just send it all to your house and you just go and wait and but you know remember everything that we do remember if our faith the Bible says is without works it's dead so Faith itself there is an expression when we acting upon God's word God wants to see that we would act upon his word that faith in his word and I would say even here this morning that we could look at it and say Lord I I I just want my faith to be to rise into that place that there would be an action in my life that when I leave out of this service there's an action also that's taking place in my life and I'm walking in that of what you've made known and I'm walking to take to my life and see my life just completely uh transformed to match that word that I'm beholding so what a blessing that Ruth has been uh permitted to come and gather in the midst of the field and you know to think of it when we look at it here I want to read just a few places so we can get the perspective on the handfuls of purpose because it wasn't as though that Ruth would have a whole line of handfuls but there was she had to glean and she had to keep gleaning and going through these handfuls and brother Bram says it like this in Redeemer and Redemption he says you know he said to the Reaper you see the young lady that's behind you yes let the gleaning be heavy and said every once in a while now I want you to catch these phrases these are things brother Ram will say over and over with this handful of purpose every once in a while drop a handful of purp on purpose oh he says I love those handfuls don't you drop a handful on purpose that she could get it in other words Don't Put It Out Of Reach but put it to where it's in her reach you see that's the reality the word is not meant to be out of reach the word has come in our Reach This is why John in first John chapter 1 he said the word of God which we have seen which we have handled with our own hands this same word of life we declare unto you so this gospel is not Out Of Reach it comes to where you and I are at to lift us from our condition into what God has called us to be so I me just say it like this the gospel is never meant to be where it's zooming over top of the people's heads never because this is where that Paul even would write how that Satan had corrupted the Simplicity that is in Christ and so if you think about this even as like our brother rap was speaking last week was so good it's it's Christ that's who we're to focus on it's him it's him that's speaking to us it's him that we're looking to and God God never wants to make anything out of reach now let me balance that and put that in perspective that doesn't mean that we don't have anything to do with it remember in the message desperation the prophet tells us he said you know those he said if you're like born with a silver spoon in your mouth he said it's like you know it it it means nothing to you but the things that you have that mean something to you and you have to labor you have to give yourself to like it was with Hannah Hannah desired a child right is that right she desired one but notice even as she's faced this persecution she's faced it from the other woman that is there and the other you know there in in the home but notice her desperation before God brought out such a deep commitment out of her life that Lord that one that you would give to me Lord I will dedicate it to you I will dedicate it to the house of the Lord let me just say it to you like this when we can see that in the right way it's more than just our natural children we can apply it that way but to realize there's something deeper than just our flesh and our spirit it's that inner man where the Holy Spirit comes in to bring forth new life and have that and say Lord the commitment my desire Lord is I want to walk and dwell in the house of the Lord like David said all the days of my life I want to walk in your word Lord I just don't want a blessing I just don't want an anointing I Want You [Applause] Lord when Hannah was in that way remember God said he blessed her with a special blessing he blessed her with the prophet let me remind you the prophet itself is an interpreter of the word and the prophet even in this hour is the spirit of truth that has come to lead and guide you and I into all truth the same one who sent the message the same one who was there and anointed the messenger and delivered that message is the spirit of truth that's right here Among Us same Holy Spirit same Angel of the Lord that's drop a handful on purpose that she could get it oh he said how Ruth felt when she grabbed a whole handful the reaper would turn around and say it's all right it's all right when God gives us an oldfashioned pouring out of the Holy Spirit a handful do it on purpose I'm glad God still does things on purpose let me tell you the Holy Ghost doesn't come in our meetings just by accident the Bible said where two or three are gathered together in my name I will be in their midst it said he dwells in the Praises of his people David wrote it and said praise Waits For You in Zion oh God there's a people that know their God there's a people that are thankful for his mercy and Lord just one little whisp of you praise Waits For You in Zion I'm thankful for your mercies Lord this week I'm thankful for your grace of keeping me Lord thank you for the strength thank you for revealing yourself Lord praise waiteth for thee in Zion Oh God so do it on purpose so there's a purpose in everything there's a in other words there's a reason behind it God just don't do things just to be doing it he don't clown no he don't show show around you know even when you think look at it even when it came to the resurrection there he did not go go back and look at Herod and say what did I tell you he didn't go back to Pilot and said hey hey remember he didn't the Bible tells us in the book of Acts he made himself known to witnesses that were chosen beforehand you were ordained for God to reveal his resurrection his word this message in this hour and remember the word has not come in are you hearing me now when God sends his word his word will achieve Isaiah 55 the purpose that it was sent to for it'll achieve it in the hearts and lives of God's people so there's a reason for everything God has a reason for the things that he does and even the way he does it right now so cuz he's not God's not an author of frustration and confusion now I want to read a quote here out of why Christ speak I I love this how brother Brandon would bring this uh in this message there's a lot more things to apply within this and it's dealing with even where brother brandham was talking about standing before that Obstacle of the Red Sea right and you know remembering that where God has brought you to and he said Moses had forgot that commissioning and brother b stands right here in 63 and says oh my here I am standing once God has committ commissioned you but you you have to be commissioned first is that right there's got to be a commissioning think about what we spoke a few weeks ago there's no commissioning No Authority without confession confession Isaiah 6 there's got to be confession first there's got to be a cleansing out of all sin and all unbelief then the Bible said after confession comes forth a sarant with a life coal to bring cleansing is that right then after the cleansing comes commissioning is that right so now once we've been commissioned there are obstacles there are things that we can stand or come before but God brings us back or to remember that God has never left us hallelujah are you hearing me now God has never left us you know because listen I I understand that we when we talk about feelings and emotions we are PE people who are made up of feelings we are people who are made up of emotion can you imagine how boring it would be without your feelings are you hearing me really but you see this is why that feelings you don't want to try to take take feelings and throw feelings out you want the Holy Spirit to govern your feelings Lord I want you to be the Lord Of My Life govern every desire and that it all point and reflect Jesus Christ so now brother R says it like this he says Lord Thy word lays up open on the pull pit and re realizing that someday it'll be closed for its last time then the word will be flesh we are we're grateful this time this morning and open to us watch these words by thy Holy Spirit the contents of this word that we shall read May the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know and may we then in return listen closely to every word weigh it deeply and then may those who are listening by the way of tape may they listen close also now notice that may we listen close and weigh it deeply Hallelujah friends if there's any area that we in our lives that sometimes even with the busyness of life and the pressures and we're not going to escape as far as the pressures and and you know that that's one of the tricks of the lady oan Age The Prophet said one of the burdens for this age is sof soft Easy Living where where the expending of our time to where there's no longer a pressure no listen we're on there's a pressure that's all around but the secret to surviving and not want to say surviving overcoming is put God first in all things amen there's always going to be test there's always going to be trial there's always going to be pressure so let's not chase after a time of wow where there'll be no troubles there'll be nothing going on no that's coming that's in the Millennium God promised peace but peace will never have peace on Earth here but you can have peace in your life to know that him who is the Prince of Peace will bring you into that place of Peace So we want to have our eyes set on the right thing is that right we want to have our eyes set on the right thing so within this this is where we want within it Lord I want to evaluate and so getting back to my point is we we it's a time of reflection it should be when the word is coming forth we don't want to just let the word pass through us we want reflect on the word of God we want to weigh it deeply weigh it deeply way you mean weigh my bre no not weigh your brother not weigh your sister our own life let our own lives be weighed in the balance not the kind of Weights that you and I choose but a just weight is that right a just weight to where it's it's it's lined up and we can examining our lives and our hearts before God cuz we only passed this way once we we we don't we don't get another shot at this we only pass this way once even in this service it's that's where it's very vital and important we can take for granted well I'll be here another service you don't know that we don't know that let me tell you friends just as much as Faith Can Build unbelief can build we're being built one way or the other notice may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us I say God help us for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain prise God it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and our understanding be open Lord so the anointing that is that comes when God comes to anoint us it is for a purpose remember brother Ram labored on this so much and he you know he had men on this side that we're making such criticism about you know the the the Pentecostals and things but yet brother BR said they're the closest to he didn't say they were he said they were the closest to that that real thing because you can't get any closer to the seed than the shuck is that right so he's identifying you oh well you know all I see him is run around and and jump and and and you know speak in tongues and this and that and brother BR said that's true but brother and then brother BR you know sometimes he'll stick up he said I'd rather have he said a little bit of wildfire than no fire but over and over brother Brandon was noticed as a prophet of God directing and looking at these things he said what it is he said they're blowing out all the steam out of the stack instead of putting it in the engine to make the wheels go on down the track so to say that what God is doing God does not come in a service that there would be one big boom of steam that would go out the Smoke Stack but God's desire when he comes with a handful of purpose is that it comes down on the inside and it puts us in motion it puts us in motion and it'll never the word when we receive the word it'll never ever put you backwards it'll never let you stay the same you realize even when we weigh it deeply take it into our lives and reflect and there's things that God deals with us and we say oh Lord Lord God I Surrender Lord mold my character Lord mold my life Lord God I confess my sins do you realize even in that you're not going backward you're going forward [Applause] Hall y sure thing now this understanding the Bible tells us I want to refer to a few places in Psalms 106 David says our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him even at the Red Sea uh even at the sea even at the Red Sea nevertheless he saved them for his Nam sake that he might make known his mighty power he might make his mighty power to be known now that's a powerful scripture there in verse in verse 7 they understood not thy wonders it was God working out these wonders now listen friends this wasn't just you know some healing Revival that was going on remember there was a message that came with this and that message was come out right any real message with God is never going to leave us in the same condition or Minister as though everything's all right it's going to call us out this is why that even as the message continues to come forth and be ministered to you and I it does not leave us in a place of complacency it's always calling us up higher because the quickening power of God Among Us it's a quickening that keeps on quickening us up from justification to Satan ification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the adoption it's more of the same Holy Spirit that's working all along it quickens as the prophet said until the moment we're changed Hallelujah it never it never is to stop lord that quickening that drawing closer to him but they not they didn't understand it because when another situation came up they looked at it and the Wonders the mighty wonders I mean the the the what was taking place in Egypt and yeah when they came to the Red Sea they you brought us out here to kill us we're just dead did you not see what God did back there amen did you not realize that that that the mightiest Nation upon the Earth and God went down and smoked the Tabernacles of ham let me bring it down to you and I personally the same God that took a care of your first birth amen hallelujah and if you've not fully seen that yet keep laying in his presence keep yielding to him because the same God that has spoke to your heart he'll take all unbelief out of your life as you'll Surrender Your Life to him your heart to him surrendering your will to him he'll take you all the way he comes to deal and to eradicate that first birth that first nature that's what God comes to do he can raise up what he said in Egypt let my son go that he may serve me so there's a purpose in this Psalms 1 11:6 he hath showed his people the power of His works that he may give them the heritage of the Heathen now God wasn't going to go in there and just clear it all out take a big old spiritual bulldozer and bulldoze out every problem in their life nope NOP every even when they crossed into the Land There was was a surrendering every battle that they faced there was a different battle plan but it was still Jehovah leading them are you with me sometimes we we have to get out there like Joshua Lord remember Joshua notice Joshua a type even not only of the last day messenger last day Ministry but brother BR would also call every believer a spiritual Joshua who's going to put the word first and to realize I'm don't want to put my ideas about this but Lord what do you want to do about this what do you say about this and God the way that God delivers it will be completely known that it had to be God to take care of it just like in the molding the shaping in our life the Deliverance the casting out of unbelief even to that of the new birth listen friends we have to stand and it's a realizing it's not what I have done but it's what God has done through a yielded vessel my so you know some of them didn't believe when they got there it was a mixed multitude you know yet God remained faithful to his word because there were some Believers in there am there was some Believers that them wonders and miracles were not falling just falling upon ground but there was some Believers in there that they were receiving these handfuls of purpose yeah it was moving in their hearts because the Bible would tell us even with Caleb and Joshua they were able to stand there steadfast even when what they said the congregation around them they were outnumbered it didn't matter how outnumbered they were they stood on God's word brother and sister that's not the DNA of Joshua and Caleb what was that it was because they had caught a hold of God and God had moved into their lives and even when the congregation pick up stones and was ready to Stone them it could not take take what was in their heart out of their heart but instead they tried to tell the people hey look what God has done look where God has brought us from hey look at the clothes you're wearing they're not threadborne hey look at the Mana that's Fallen hey the water that's that's come from the rock is trying to get us to look at the Supernatural That's right here Among Us God is not making accidents by sending his Spirit he's sending his Spirit his word on purpose when God makes a promise in his word that's God committing himself to his word is that right amen so now when we see this this is why even when you know Gideon would come to his place you know in here uh the angel of the Lord that followed the messengers message came and found him and said hey th Mighty Man of Valor Gideon you know looking around and who else is here but he asked the question if God's with us where's all of his miracles because why is all this befalling Us in other words why are we in this condition you see Gideon are you hearing me now Gideon was recognizing this was not just a test or a trial I hope you're hearing me now sometimes we have we need God's grace to bring the discernment between what's correction and what's a test and a trial that's right get it said if God be with us where be all the Miracles why is all this befalling us you know why because he knew when God the presence of God is with his people there is the blessing of God it doesn't matter how outnumbered you are if God's on your side you're more than enough for the match hallu Hallelujah you can take every opinion by a doctor that's against you but if God is on your side the Bible said if God be for us who can be against us Hall come on friends I'll take those odds any day you'll never find in the scripture where God had to have a multitude God never had to have well I got to have a mass so I can live a mass of people so I can live a Victorious life you don't need a mass of people to live a Victorious Life you just need to know Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection and thou shalt Smite him as one man [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah that's so good Oh Glory we don't need a crowd we need his presence amen is that right go in this thy might what was thy might Gideon because he's looking that if we need the God who performs Miracles and let me tell you you can have in Miracles and miracles all around I my wife just shared with me here uh just of a of of a gentleman uh and it just made me cry when she shared it with me there later on Friday night of a man that as a pastor had lost his voice he had lost it and when he lost that voice he lost his voice he lost his livelihood he could not get hired anywhere and now years and years later and he was at the point he actually tried to take his life but it was restrained from taking it and and the church itself said hey we want you to come up and do a devotion and we want you to do a devotion on healing he said I can't talk they bought a special microphone for him and he you could hear his voice and as he begin to talk about healing all of a sudden there was something that opened up and you just hear him stop it they got the recording and it stopped and it opened up and he's talking he's referring to I'm the Lord that Health all my diseases it begins to weep on there he says something just happened in the congregation his wife different ones so let me just tell you something Miracles are not confined just to the Bride of Jesus Christ are you hearing me so the Miracles that we're talking about sure we believe in all that sure we witness that and we need the healing we need God in moving on the scene but friends let me tell you the greatest miracle that can ever take place is when God changes a person's life from Death unto life because if this body fails and gets sick it gets well it'll fail again but once that Soul has ever been healed it can never no more be sick that's the greatest Miracle so what Gideon is asking for God Among Us God in my [Applause] life Hallelujah I want the god that opened the Red Sea I've got some things that need parted in my life I've got some areas that I need to see the grace of God break back these things so I can walk forward that is so good Hallelujah and the kinsman redeemer once again brother Bram says how's she's gleaning for life he says oh how those angels He said those angels you Reapers every once in a while drop a handful on purpose now watch this don't let it all be so tiresome for her I think that's pretty powerful because you know sometimes as we're laboring it gets tiresome the Bible says be not weary and well doing for in due season you shall reap right that means that we're we're taking we're drawing our strength from the Lord because you know this is why that every time in our life every day is not a red letter day there's a lot of black letters in here right but if you want red letter days you got to follow the black letters the black letters Make Way for red letter days but a lot of times we don't like the black letter days don't sit that that's not spiritual no no remember before the fire fell God gave a word to elah but just because he gave that word did not mean the fire was going to come Elijah had to do and act upon what the word said do and that was wait till the evening time patience then it had to be assemble and rebuild the altar that's another thing then lay the wood in order another thing then lay the sacrifice in order and I want 12 barrels of water to be poured over it to show that it's not some hidden little trick I want you to water log it because I'm going to show that even when things are impossible that there's nothing impossible for the consuming fire of almighty God to come down and transform that life Hallelujah don't you love him don't let it be tiresome for us and watch this every once in a while let her hear a good message let a good power of the Holy Spirit cover her over once in a while to let her know that I'm still there so wait a minute does that mean that when I don't feel it and there's not a handful of purpose does that mean he's on vacation does that mean I need to go find where's he where'd he go where'd he go where where'd he go where'd he go hey so and so is he over there hey no he does it to let us know he's been the one watching over our lives the whole time amen because when he drops a handful of purpose it's for a specific reason and need in our lives am that's why he does it but sometimes this is where we can get under the the part and oh my you know uh but remember this is where we want to rest just like this field across the street which I know has been taken over but there's one down the road and you know what they had to sew that wheat the first thing they had to do or that the soybeans they had to disc up that ground right right right right they had to disc it up if you want a crop you got to break it up this is why the Bible even talks about you want to see more of God in your life break up the F ground right keep your life just be a be a channel that's clean and clear keep everything confessed and under the blood are you hearing me Church you see and then notice then there's got to be seed that's sewn and then that there's got to be watering and you know the Harvest comes in its time and when the Harvest comes you want to be faithful all the way through through amen not just showing up where there's a harvest you understand me you don't want to just run from this field oh there's a harvest here I'll go to this field there's a heart you want to stay and be faithful to what God has called you to do amen is that all right notice he said do some kind of a healing amongst her that realize that only God can do is that right show some kind of a sign or a wonder that she'll know that I'm in her midst oh brother Braham said don't you find like to find them handfuls notice what it's all about brother BR keeps saying it show that I'm in her midst show her that I care show her eye it's about him it's about him amen don't you like to find them handfuls so you mean that the handfuls it didn't just like hey hey come over here here's a handful no you have to seek and you shall [Music] find knock and it shall be open unto you ask that shows our faith that's why there's things remember the gospel is not going over our head but there's things that God deals with our life that we take out of here and we start beginning we go into prayer and Lord I it moves us into that place of seeking for that word to become flesh in our lives that's God does that purposely he does it purposely a handful of fresh barley Lord do something that he used to do something that he know we know he does he's the lord of the Harvest he's the only one can drop the handful oh brother B said I've commanded the angels to go down to that meeting this morning I want them to do a certain certain thing I've commanded them and they'll do it now remember the Bible tells us that they the Lord was with them in Mark 16 confirming working with the and confirming the word with signs following prise Lord when you look through the book of Acts now the book of Acts 26 chapters is that right 26 chapters but the book of Acts being sorry 28 chapters that's why you didn't say right but it didn't take place in 28 days see sometimes our our thinking of you had another book of Acts behind it we're thinking every single day 32 years was the book of Acts there was laboring in the book of Acts there was persecutions hate to say it misunderstandings yeah see God listen God didn't pull his hands back and say oh no Satan you can't test him he allowed he allowed it to be tested just like the mixed multitude that came out God permitted all those things but remember the signs and wonders were done there were there were no there were many I I don't know how many but how many that would have maybe seen the signs and wonders that were done through Paul but yet not all of them were converted not all of them came along and walked on into the light of the Gospel but there were those who were ordained to life that even when there were some that were blocked away from hearing the word but God would move in such a supernatural way to get their attention the Bible says concerning Paul remember in the work of an apostle the Bible said there were special Miracles done by the hand of Paul is that right for what purpose what reason was it to draw attention to Paul not at all but God allowed that and gave that so what that there would be those who would recognize hey who is among us this is more than a man that's Among Us here it's the Living God that's Among Us no wonder Paul could stand there on Mars Hill when they had all of their altars and he found one that said to the unknown God Paul stood right there and he introduced him not only introduced him but he unfolded his name to them he revealed Christ to them Hallelujah you see the purpose of God coming and delivering the word is so that the people might come into a relationship with almighty God this is why you had a church started in Corin Corinthians this is why you had the galatian church and eventually there were multitudes of churches as even it says in Philippians 1 and to the churches that are throughout there were churches even as Peter would write even to the strangers elects that are in caposa Bethania all of those around the word of God notice god listen even in their comfort zone God knew if he didn't let persecution come they would have been one communal complex are you hearing me now God never intended for his word to be communal it should be the holy spirit in us that is called brings about a Brotherhood one with another is that right let Brotherly Love continue it ought to be the love of God unites us together around the word of God and it will if it's a love of God it'll unite us around the word of God not around our feelings not around our favorite this or favorite that we'll be United around the word of God we might have our favorite we might have this but never should our favorites or anything about us be placed above God's word are you hearing me we've seen that example I could give examples through the prophet's life but notice there's a reason why God would send his word it's it's turning the hearts and moving lives into a union with him this is why Paul would even write of it in in Hebrews chapter 2 and he would say in verse three how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salv ation and the prophet would pick that phrase up and said once the word he said said like you've been prayed for the word has been delivered he said if you get away from the word you get away from your healing you get away from your strength but we want to stay with the word which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that H him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with d Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will for what purpose was to bring the people to the realization of Hebrews 13:8 he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now think about this anytime there's a reality where God moves like when they saw in John 6 motto they seen the same God who had moved through Elisha when there was a feeding of the multitude in Elisha's day they seen that same God right here on display when those Loaves and Fishes were taken and multiplied and and and here there were baskets to be taken up now the disciples they were witnessing all this as well I mean everybody else too listen let me tell you something everybody that day was a partaker of a miracle right are you hearing me everybody was was a partaker of a miracle that day but it didn't have the same effect on everybody for some people it just got their bellies full now let me bring it on down when Jesus came remember he's had them following him they were they were coming after him and Jesus said you're not coming after me because of of who I am you're coming after me because you ate and you were full brother Samuel what are you saying that is there is some in your heart that looks at on the handfuls of purpose and says that is good but there is more in Christ for me there's more it's about him it's not just about being satisfied my goodness I was in a good service and praise God glory to God I got up and I did this or I did that and then that's it oh my that's it that's the same thing the message came to correct the Pentecostals on are you hearing me because they argued they argued their experience against the word well I've spoken tongues I've done this brother brand will sit there and tell us he said you try to tell a woman that's wearing shorts and the Holy Spirit has allowed her to speak in tongues you try to tell her she's wrong why she's going on experience rather than the word the holy spirit is not an unclean Spirit the Holy Spirit and the word are one we can't have the Holy Ghost and disagree with one part of God's word we might have it in our spirit but we don't have it in the soul that'll bring a change to where there's a match piece that's made that's why this word came are you hearing me not against dancing not against shouting I mean obviously I can preach on this I'm not against that but I tell you one thing we're not reaching for that that's not your goal are you hearing me that's not the goal that doesn't even mean wow that's a good service that is not what's a good service is when our lives have received a handful of purpose and it works out of our life if it becomes just about the CH coming to the house of God and all that happens here we become denominational Christians Traditions come on friends this word is not about a tradition this word was for Christ to live in flesh you might cry you might run you might shout it may not even be the service for that that's right good but I'll tell you one thing when there comes a handful of purpose however God has made me I like to feel it amen I I might cry a little bit I might [Music] say sometimes it gets a hold of me I want to say it out here but I just can't say it I just bring it in here and and Lord you know this is sure good Lord but then there's other times my goodness when it begins to strike and my feet go to tapping oh my a handful of [Applause] purpose so everywhere you know God moves the prophet said in the message expectation wherever God moves loves anytime Through the Bible you'll see healing miracles signs and wonders he leaves a behind him a track of the supernatural Hallelujah now you see you see when God sends a Revival you know this is where the Prophet is he would talk about that handful of purpose oh every once in a while and he'll talk about a Revival but you know a Revival itself a true God called Revival it calls us back to the word is that right it calls us back to the word now now listen friends this is where I I'm not asking you I'm not trying to upset where you're at but I'm just saying in this way sometimes we can become so complacent because well I know who the messenger is and I know this and I said here in the message church and I can quote this and we become so leaning upon that in instead of realizing who's in our midst this message never came to make us Idol worshippers are you hearing me this is why the prophet could preach in the message all things he said you Pentecostals have taken the genuine articles of God speaking in tongues all those other things he said you have made a tradition out of it why because it had to happen every single service they be dependent upon emotion instead of the word of God if there's anything that ought to bring emotion it ought to be the word we don't need the music I appreciate music but there's one thing it ought to be the word that puts us into action it ought to be the spirit of God moving in our life that calls us Beyond [Applause] unbelief Hallelujah it gets us away from the reasonings of man this is where Calvin failed the prophet will spend time with this on the seals and Calvin had got to such a place on eternal security to he looked at it talking about predestination eternal security we don't need revivals no more and he got off because let me tell you something with a predestinated seed it's going to take the quickening power of almighty God to come down on that seed it's going to take the inspiration of the the Holy Spirit of his word being poured out in that season for that hour that's why a Luther's message won't take effect on you Wesley's message Pentecostal listen this is why a Pentecostal message won't take effect on you it has to be a brid time message it had to be a message of the son of man as a matter of fact the prophet says it in 1958 the call out he said the son of man is even being revealed now 1958 even being revealed now he said this is what you should do run to the middle of the field of God's grace and ask for his Mercy what are you saying Ruth you don't got to go to the corners run to the middle of the field of God's grace but that predestinated seed has got to be quickened it's got to have this is why every generation has to have their opportunity a fresh chance at the world of God there's got to be a new birth that's why listen friends that's why with the seed of almighty god listen when we talk about sons of God do you realize if the reason that that is called like that in 1 John 3:1 beloved no what considering a what love that is bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God you know what it is it's letting you know who you are it's letting us know who we are but remember we have to come through the same process we have to come into that place to become a Vindicated manifested Son of God is that right the prophet taught us in the opening of the seals and then on he said not only must these seals be by by divine revelation but by Divine Vindication and the prophet will work those two the rest of the way through the message because whatever has been revealed now we're looking to that Lord it would become Vindicated in my life there was a man John 5 he was down there by the the pool of Bethesda you know the story probably most of us do he was laying down there impotent not a it want a disease or something was going to you know take him out of here he'd been there for 38 years but the Bible would tell us why was he laying there because there'd be a visitation there every season yes now I want you to think about this the Bible said verse four for an angel went down at a certain season right into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had you know what it was that kept him there Faith because when you read on down the scriptures he had every reason in the world to get up or to however he would go roll or whatever more because he said when I go to get in there before I go to get in somebody steps in ahead of me you know how much discouragement that how many times he had been discouraged you know matter how many times the devil had told him you might as well pack it up you know oh yeah you know he's coming but look somebody always gets it ahead of you but there was a faith that held him there you know why he said I've seen handfuls of purpose come in here and there is mine is going to come one of these days hallelujah are you hearing me now him staying right there was a confession of his faith in God's [Applause] word his works exhibited his faith brother let me tell you the one that sent all the messengers the one that sent all of them here he came down and he came he stepped over this one stepped over that one stepped over this one and he said will thou be made whole and he began to explain to him I can't get down there when I go to get down there somebody steps in front of me he said rise up and take up thy bed and walk he couldn't get to the water but the one who sent the Angels Came to where he was a handful of purpose Hall and he became a testimony he did this is why the prophet said every once in a while out of the message job every once in a while drop just a little handful on purpose just a little handful on purpose a little oldfashioned Revival that stirs up the water a little bit drop a little on purpose oh he said don't you like those little handfuls along the road I do Lord I love them I love them I love them Lord wow it's encouragement to me oh brother sammon you're just a sign follower no no signs follow me but I when I recognize him it just lets me know he's been here the whole time can I tell you a little Story I Heard brother Daryl Ward tell he probably told it here but it just blessed me so much he said here when they have they take them them Scouts those e those Indians out and when the man when he's going to become a man his daddy takes him out to a secret place that only his daddy knows and he puts him there on a rock and he binds up his hands binds up his feet but he binds it in a way so he can get out of it but then the last thing is is he puts this around his eyes and then he has to stay there all night don't get scared when not going to do it to you but he so at night you could hear the cricking maybe the crack is that a bear oh is that there ain't no light switch there ain't no light switch oh what is that and finally in the morning when the sun raay as soon as that Sun at the rising of the sun it begins to hit his his face he then can take it down and when he takes it down then he's taking this off and he takes it off and about that time he looks and his daddy has been sitting behind him the whole time so let me tell you God bringing Sons into sunship bringing you and I in maturity he's right there the whole time when there's a handful of purpose that he comes and you think man that's just what was going in in school he's letting you know he's walking with you down those School Halls he's letting you know that I'm right there on the job with you God doesn't stop at the church door you are his church Hallelujah you are his Tabernacle you are his dwelling place and he lives in you and worships [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah all them little handfuls along the road the promises of God that just kind of jerks you up a little bit gives a little bit of that life that come out of the field of God I'm so glad for that encouragement and refreshing aren't you glad for that aren't you glad he renews our our youth Like an Eagle brother BR said sometimes we get all kind of down and stale and you know and all that once the Holy Spirit comes renews us again oh thank God with a renewing experience of our youth thank you Lord sometimes I mean we can get so well forgive me we can get so old and grouchy and contener and we forget about the grace of God now I'm not just talking about old and age sometimes we you know what happens when you get away from the presence of God the prophet said you get prickly in the message 1965 of Shame you get out from the presence of God he's talking about coming to the house of God gathering around with other believers he said when you get out from under the presence of God where the spirit of God is coming out you begin to get sticky and Pokey and pricky and everything oh everything bothers me you know what you need a good dose of a handful of purpose did just be honest say Lord drop a handful right here I need a handful of purpose so I can get right back to the purpose that I'm to be I'm to be a son and daughter of God God never made me to frown and worry and be sad and contener us the Bible said happy is the people whose God is the Lord hallelujah oh my hallu amen let's just close here every now and then the prophet would say he would use those phrases every once in a while Lord every now and then let it fall you know what happened we would become so common among us you know I listen friends I every service is really unique it is I I don't know how else to explain that you know there's certain things maybe certain things that I can look at that I've got to preach I'm like wow man this is and then there's other times I look at oh lord lord is there another you could send in dear Lord so there's but that's how it is even in our Christian walk when it comes to living there's parts of the word hey it's no problem love everybody but it's when you really have to do that to die to ourselves that's that that's when it really comes down to living and we got to died to our own will so we we all face that in one form or another but if if it came in such a way every single time it would become so common to us but God knows just how to tailor each service every part that we're at because God wants to drop those handfuls of purpose where we can take that purpose up and say thank you Lord amen thank you Lord now let me close close with this I'm closing but I want to leave you with this right here if you look on down in your scriptures there in Ro Ruth 2:1 17 and I try to be as quick as I can here but I want to leave you with this here's these handfuls of purpose in verse 17 it says she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and what is about an Ean of barley so not only did she have to pick it up she had to beat it out had to winnow it you know she had to do she had to and it the Chuck and all those other things would just kind of go with the wind because what she was going to take home was seed Hallelujah that's so good are you hearing me this is why there's things that even as we're listening to the preaching of the word what you want to take home it's not brother Samuel you want to take home Christ are you here are you hearing me that's what you want to take home you want to take home Christ so here how that here you're gathering in that word and here it is she's beating it out my she just have to labor to bring it in but she's got to beat it out now Wi on it and gather that seed the Bible says she has an epha of barley barley resurrection power brother Aaron it's five and a half gallons in our terms now that may not seem like a lot to you and I CU we go to Costco and buy a big old sack of flour you know or Sam's Club and Harley put it into the cart you know but but for this when she comes back around in verse 18 the Bible says she took it up went into the City and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her she had reserved after she was suffice so notice she actually brought back from boaz's table there that meal what she haded it was like them little bear cubs that got in brother bram's molasses brother Bram said that mother one going to come over there but them youngans they got over there man they looked at all around and you know how the Bears get in there I don't know how it look look I my imagination just goes on me you know I'm thinking about him knocking over the tent and man just getting in that molasses bucket brother BR said they had it all over he said that one's little eyes was stuck I said oh God let the Molasses of the Holy Spirit to where if our eyes are seeing nothing but wrong let the anointing of the Holy Spirit come over our eyes that we can see nothing but God's grace God's mercy God's love for us got over there to the mama the mama wouldn't come but oh they got where mama was at she was cleaning them off that time boy but it wasn't to cleaning off chore like a mama washing Cubs she was draw away from what they had received they were shopping with molasses good and Ruth gives to Naomi notice this it's passing from a gentile to a Jew see the same holy ghost that we have receiv received will be passed to the Jews those two witnesses will preach the same baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll preach this same message of the hour it's Christ so here she sufficed now here's where I'm going to come to verse 19 and her mother-in-law said to her now watch this even Naomi Naomi didn't say man this is good this this barley cake man this is good wow this is good my Ruth look at that epha that that 5 and2 gallon my goodness man thank God oh my a this wonderful but Naomi being spiritual see Ruth is not aware of what's going on right but Naomi says in verse 19 where hast thou gleaned today because Naomi realizes you wouldn't have had this much if you would have been on the outer parts you wouldn't have had this much Where have you been you see what it was Naomi couldn't see it but what was done in secret amen was actually being showed openly her gleaning in secret this is why in Matthew 6 it says oh that you would hide away and pray oh sometimes it's friends it's taking the word it's praying over the word that's the purpose this is why the handful is a purpose to encourage us in our walk with God where R Us thou Blessed Be he that did take knowledge of thee somebody has taken knowledge of your Ruth you may not realize it but what you're carrying right now where have you been what message have you been sitting under and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought she said the man's name with whom I wrought today Hallelujah is Boaz that means nothing to Ruth right now but as soon as that name is mentioned remember Naomi comes out and Naomi says verse 20 Blessed Be he of the Lord W her tune has changed right in Ruth chapter 1 she said don't call me Naomi call me Mara but you see when you begin to see that handful of purpose you begin to see the presence of God moving down you begin to see God working in our midst there is a purpose for what God's doing now she says Blessed Be he of the Lord who hath left not his kindness to the living and to the dead and Naomi said to her the man is near kin unto us one of our next Kinsmen prise the Lord and Ruth said he said also to me Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my Harvest and Naomi said unto Ruth or Donald remember this is the Old Testament this is the laws of the Kinsmen it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean until the end of barley Harvest and of wheat Harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law Naomi realizes this this is more than just about handfuls of purpose see right now there's a there there is a reality coming that's going to se that separates the seed from the Shu that it's not just about blessings it's not just about feelings but it's about Boaz all of this that has been received it's about Boaz and this with Boaz it's about you Ruth see the word is revealed feeling that per there's a purpose in what's being done this just hasn't happened let me just say it to you like this this word has not just come across your pathway but we are responsible for what we'll do with it we've got a choice friends we can take it and we can live and let this word transform our lives or we can just sit we can enjoy it go back out back to our homes back outside and we continue the same way we are or we can say Lord I want to take that purpose I want to give I want to surrender of my all Lord there's a reason why you've sent your word there's a reason why God sends an evangelist a teacher there's a reason why God sends his word it's so that that word might live might transform inside in our lives there's a purpose for it amen so I say thank God for every every good service but I'll say this if we're not being changed then what good is it doing us you've got to be able to ask that question what's the message doing in my life what am I am I giving myself I'm not talking about being able to quote quotes and and look and look the part friends I'm not I I think thank God for for Holiness and thing but I'm talking about a Holiness that comes from the inside cuz whatever is on the inside will come to the outside are you hearing me this is where we want to it's about Boaz it's about him he's the one who's in our midst he's the one that can do the work of the Kinsman he's the one that can bring us into our inheritance that's why the handfuls of purpose this is why God speaks to us in a personal way this is why God comes and he'll bring in another brother that maybe we've never met and God will bring that brother in and he'll Minister the word of God to us it was not just to make us feel good amen it's for reflection in our lives Lord I want to move on with you I want to surrender my all with you Lord God if there's things I need to confess and laying my life on the altar I want to do that Lord amen you see that's the difference that comes from the bride it's something that is realizing there's a purpose to this why am I here why did God put me here why did God send this message down my path I wasn't looking for for him he came looking for me there was a hunger for something beyond what what what you had in your life but you couldn't even explain it there it was it was a it was a drawing that was going on in your life but God had a purpose this message didn't come to you by accident that's right there was a purpose and God's desire is to achieve his purpose fully in your life amen let's pray Heavenly Father oh dear God how thankful we are Lord for the handfuls Lord of purpose Lord Lord to realize the encouragement the refreshing the renewing that comes our way Lord that father in everything that you do you do it with a purpose when Ruth Lord would get back to Naomi it was what Naomi could see that she returned with to know there's something somebody that's taking knowledge of you amen Lord right here I believe God is the same way you speaking Lord so personally to our lives calling to our hearts Lord wooing us Lord by your presence things that Lord that nobody would know things that Lord that has been on our hearts sometimes Lord things that we've prayed about other times Lord that handful of purpose will sweep right by in a healing of our body but Lord nonetheless in all these things it's you taking knowledge of us but Lord Jesus we just don't want to rejoice in the handfuls of purpose we don't want to be as it like the prophet said just blowing it out the Smoke Stack Lord we want it to be put to use in our lives it's an encouragement it's a strength it's it's kind of like Lord once in a while when a boss or somebody that will come by and I know that sometimes these are things are so rare but sometimes Lord you can have somebody come by and say hey I appreciate the job you're doing thank you for the those those details thank you for the things you're doing Lord it's something about that when just that little bit of an appreciation is showed it it just it helps us Lord I remember remember those things Lord how it helps us it encourages us Lord I think about it Lord even as a minister at times Lord I know brother Ivon others Lord that could say the same thing sometimes Lord when we're looking Lord at what we're ministering sometimes Lord it feels like it's been scrambled eggs but yet then Lord God how that father you it's been you that through it has touched the heart of somebody somebody's life has been touched has been affected Lord has been encouraged Lord Jesus this is what Lord God that you come to do is to encourage us in the word Lord you you don't come with your presence you don't sweep Lord among us Lord God that Lord that where we would become comfortable in just feeling the anointing just feeling the presence of God how thankful I Am Lord I I want to say this I am so thankful for your presence Among Us Lord I'm so thankful Lord God for the word of God moving Among Us Lord Lord I believe your desire Lord even as you would bring this about to our hearts like it was to Ruth you would help us to understand to make it Lord God where we reflect and realize you want to do more Lord you want to do more your presence has come to change us Lord to move Upon Our Lives to transform us Lord may we lord I pray God as your children like Ruth she had to reach down when she saw that handful of purpose and she had to pick it up she had to pick up every sheath sometimes the Lord he would go from one service and then it might be weeks or a month and then be another handful of purpose but she was gleaning she was gleaning the whole time like your Prophet said every once in a while you know Lord when and just to what measure you know just how to do it among us this is where our faith comes in Lord oh how I love to feel you Lord I love to feel your presence Lord when you come in in the times of prayer Lord God As you move Among Us oh I I just love to feel your presence but Lord as you teach us that even Lord when we don't feel your presence you're right there with us Lord It's Not Us imagining it it's not us just Lord God off the top of our head but we we have that Assurance for you said Lo I'm with thee always and we know Lord God that once we have been as we've been United with you we're not we're not separate these two shall be one we know Lord that even as the spirit of God would create a hunger and a thirst for righteousness the Bible said blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled your Prophet would take that scripture and tell us that's a sign that the Holy Ghost is upon you not that you have it but it's upon you the holy spirit is creating and stirring up that hunger in your life he wants to be the satisfier of your life he wants to be your satisfying portion why don't you st why don't you come away from the edges of the fields you don't got to glean like a beggar you don't got the presence of the Lord is here to is here to woo you you don't have to remain a stranger come to the middle of God's field of Grace say Lord I take your mercy Lord I pour out Lord of my life my heart Lord God an open confession Lord oh Lord Jesus we weren't meant to walk around the corners we were meant to dwell with you [Music] Lord I want to say Lord as well thank you for your grace in this hour Lord Lord God I everybody else we'd all been like Lord been like anyone else we might have been looking at Lord certain things things Lord and gleanings in the field and events just like it's written in the scriptures like it was written of them when they came out of Egypt Lord but I'm so thankful for the understanding that God that you have breathed Upon Our Hearts to understand what the Miracles is all about that the Miracles that you've done is Lord you manifesting yourself that you're still here you're still the same God I think how your Prophet said when you would take Lord that of Divine Healing and it would be displayed before the people and shown that the same God that can take a case that is hopeless that same God can take a case spiritually that seems hopeless and transform that life so completely Lord God this is your purpose of coming Lord It's a purpose Lord of every handful you drop our way that even Lord as we would walk through the day we could be more even aware Even in our prayer life Lord guide me on the job today Lord Lord God I want to be available I want to be a witness Lord I want to be a real testimony I want to display be a display of the glory of God in my home Wherever I Go Lord I want them to see you my Boaz My Kinsman this is why the handfuls of purpose and the Sheep Lord because you have taken knowledge of us Lord as you've come by your presence to make us known make known to us you've taken knowledge of us now I ask you as every head is bowed he's taken knowledge of you will you take knowledge and receive that that he's taken knowledge of you say Lord thank you I I receive it Lord I I take it in to weigh it deeply in my life Lord whatever the need might be it it might be for the Holy Ghost might be for healing might be a besetting sin might be a weight but Lord I take it in I I want to reflect you I don't want these this hindrance in my life will you take knowledge of him God bless you listen friends he's here to give you strength he's here to bring Deliverance to your life you don't need to stay in the corners you can come right out to the middle of the field Hallelujah Heavenly [Music] Father you're so mindful Lord amen the Lord behind those needs Lord God I know Lord that there's things that you can do right now I know there's things Lord that even while the words going forth that you can do but I also realize Lord there's times like when Ruth she had to take the handfuls of purpose and the sheaves and she had to beat it out thrash it out now Lord we want to take hold on this word like Paul said I seek to apprehend that which I've been apprehended of I want to see it Lord in my life Lord anybody

[Applause] [Music] ever I tell you the way the Lord Jesus could say to the disciples blessed are your eyes that see amen and your ears that hear for many righteous men and Prophets have desired to hear the things that you have heard it was a time and an age of fulfillment and I tell you what a blessing it is to be able to see and recognize what God is doing in this hour yes sir that's right and to be able to see yourself in it that's right and see him in you absolutely yes sir this this message message come that Christ would live in flesh brother BR gives that simple example and mighty God unveiled before us remember the little boy the storm going on Mama I'm scared she said well we're Christians you know we're Christians God is with us he said but mama when it's storming like this yes I want god with skin on it and in these storms of lady oia when there's such an outpouring of demonic power all around us the lid has been taken off of hell and the prophet said streams of demon power yes I look at those words that he uses streaming yes streaming out of Hollywood streaming throughout all those things but just as much as all of hell has emptied out all of Heaven has come [Applause] down remember it's it's not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord the whole key is US surrendering us getting out of the way that's what the word as it comes to do even when Naomi spoke to Ruth she's just letting Ruth know even in that moment hey this hasn't been by chance that you found these handfuls of purpose this isn't by chance that you found these sheep but Naomi let's her know somebody's taking knowledge of you Ruth said I don't know if it's some some guy by the name of Boaz it was a man that that's who that's what he said his name was but Naomi would have all of the concealed within there all the Redemptive names of Jehovah and all that it would mean amen aren't you grateful for God's grace friends God has he has everything that we have need of it's us taking it down into our own lives even as we leave out of here sometimes you don't see things right away in your life but sometimes that's where it's beating it out sometimes that's where it's beating it out our will and surrendering but you know what every word of God will come to pass in its season but we want to be found faithful is like that man who was at the pool of Bethesda I'm looking for God to fulfill his word amen you believe that amen uh Brother Ray has just a a quick testimony here before we're dismissed gray the gray go ahead hello okay yeah yeah um this happened a long time ago but I felt to just share it with you there was a young man I used to pick up from Cleveland bring them to the church services um it the Lord was dealing with him very much and um so there was uh things that he would see that was God showing them spiritually seeing things and and uh I started sharing with him about how God is still the same and he does Miracles so I started sharing with him about miracles well he one day he invited us my wife and I and my daughter um to to a picnic and uh and then he says I want to show you something Ray Brother Ray he says this this ball and it was so sentimental to him and everything that somebody gave to him and uh and he says you know I can throw this ball and he was showing me how high he could throw and he was showing it throwing it real high and um all of a sudden it went over the white at the Lighthouse and we went around the lighthouse and it wasn't there in the long on it was in the water and he says oh no you know he was real heartbroken he said that meant so much to me you know and just then I just felt to say you know in the Bible there was a man that borrowed an Axe and when he was using it the axe went into the water and he cried out to the prophet and says oh no you know I said just like you David and he says I said remember I told you all these Miracles and he said yeah I said that happened that was one of them and you know God can give you your ball back and he said you think so I said sure I says but you have to go get a stick because I explained to him about the stick and he got he went running by the pier looking up and down for it for a stick and he brought it I said remember it has to be a long one because we're way up here and it has to go all the way there there's a railing so he brought the stick and the ball was going way out way out way out and I said will put the stick in the water and the ball will come to it and kept on going out and out you know like trials you know but then the ball came right to the stick and it stayed with the stick and he says how we going to get it and I didn't know that there was a group of people way down there that was listening because because of my voice was carrying and it was going from North to the South and they were down there and they says we got a net we got a net you can borrow this net and take it and use it they were listening the whole time I didn't know it and and they were pretty far uh that's a miracle within itself and he scooped up the ball I just wanted to share that with you there's there's a lot of details that he left out yeah but it was very good there's things that I'm glad that God God brings things back to us sometimes there might be things you feel like that has escaped you even sometimes your joy but there's a way for that joy to return yes you know when putting the stick in the water that's representing bringing Christ into your situation right it's bringing our life submitting our life our heart our all and God knows how to bring things back around don't you love him amen just appreciate him Amen brother Brian Hannah will you come and dismiss us in a word of prayer amen so good to be here this morning isn't it amen amen
