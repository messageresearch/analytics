Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. [Applause] Let's try that chorus, Ben, that take me deeper. This was a a chorus we sang down at the man's meeting. It was such a blessing to me, I really wanted to bring it back, but I only got the chorus so far. We'll get the rest of the song later, but it's a beautiful song. Amen. And it's my prayer.

I believe God's got something special for us tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. If our expectation is there, God God can do anything tonight. Amen. Amazing grace shall always be my song of praise. For it was grace that bought my liberty. I do not know just why he came to love me. So there's a lot of faults. Hallelujah. A lot of faults beyond my fault. and he saw my need. And I shall forever [Music] my eyes to Calary. [Music] and view the cross where Jesus died for me. Oh yes Lord, how marvelous [Applause] the grace had fallen [Music] soul. He looked beyond my fault and all. Let's all stand as our pastor comes. Let's sing it again now. Amazing grace. It's amazing. Oh, amazing grace [Music] shall always be my song of praise. Oh yes. For it was grace that brought my liberty. Lord, I do not know just why he came and loved me so. Thank God he looked beyond my Hallelujah. And he saw my knees. Oh, I shall never to change. Oh, let me [Music] Jesus for me. How [Music] grace that caught my fallen soul. He looks beyond all my faults and saw my need. &gt;&gt; One more time. I shall forever lift my eyes together. Oh yes. Oh to see God's love expressed. [Music] &gt;&gt; All the finished work done for me. for me. How marvelous. Oh, the grace that calls my fully soul. He looks beyond all my faults and he's all my need. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. He's worthy. He's the worthy one. Amen. I'm so glad for that. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. He There was a lot of faults he had to look beyond the condition that we were in. And not just that, but I think how brother Bram says, I don't know who the brother Mike is, but I've always quote that quote has always stood out to me in questions and answers. He said, "To think of it, brother Mike, he chose us even knowing all of our mistakes." But see, his choosing was before any mistakes. &gt;&gt; His so his choosing is greater than any of your mistakes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because his choosing was not in time. &gt;&gt; He had knowledge of that. He had knowledge of it. But his choosing was before there was one even one spirit wrong spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the devil was ever the devil, as a matter of fact, before he was ever created, &gt;&gt; you are in God's mind. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And that's where we're going back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not going back per se to his mind, but we're going back to what God thought of. &gt;&gt; But this time, those thoughts have already started to become &gt;&gt; material. And once God's word starts to unfold, there's no stopping it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It just keeps on unfolding just like in your life all the way through until the complete achievement. And to think of it, how God will stand there even in that time, even after everything is all said and done, that that great declaration, it's good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's good. &gt;&gt; It's good. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; So appreciate his goodness to us. Amen. God is so good. So good to be gathered here tonight. So appreciate seeing each and every one of you and the sacrifice that you've made to be here tonight. And we just want to hear from God. &gt;&gt; We want to give ourselves to the Lord. I want to leave out of here changed. &gt;&gt; And I realize that when we leave out of here changed, there's sometimes where God will bring an absolute change right there. And then there's other things in our life that God will do and he begins to initiate the change by causing our hearts to be inclined to him. &gt;&gt; And it won't be something that we can just have hands laid on us and it's achieved. But character is not a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a victory. &gt;&gt; All everything that we have that's needed, prayer lines are needed, the altar's needed, every one of these parts. But as we come through, that character is a gift. Not a gift, I'm sorry. It's a victory. And if it's a victory, it means there's a battle. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll be honest with you. I'll be honest with you, man. How many times I would have loved to just God just hand it to me. &gt;&gt; But God doesn't do it that way. &gt;&gt; But you know what? He's got confidence in his word &gt;&gt; and he'll work with our lives, deal with us, and bring us to a place to say, "Yes, Lord." Like the song was sung tonight. Take me deeper, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take me deeper. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer before we read the word of the Lord here tonight. Heavenly Father, we love you, Lord Jesus, and we so appreciate your mercy and your goodness. Lord God, right among us and in our lives, Lord. And Lord, as we move into this further part of the service, we've come to fellowship around your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord God, just stepping away from the the cares of this life. And I pray Lord that you would give each of us the grace that we need just to be able Lord to move from just the dwelling upon this realm and all the pressures and all the the burdens of life. God may you just come Lord and lift us in your presence. May you come, Lord, and minister to our lives tonight. That Lord, when we would walk out of this place, should you, Terry, there's become a refreshment and a strengthening in our lives. that Lord, not that the trials and the troubles are taken away necessarily, but that Father, we've got a renewed confidence to be able to face the cares of this life, but to be able to do it, Lord, with the Lord Jesus, a renewed joy and strength in our lives. Lord, we love you, Father. We so appreciate your mercy. &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask that you would come here tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, come take the pull pit tonight, Lord. Come be the speaker tonight. That could be no greater honor than you would come tonight, Lord, and speak to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you just guide and direct us, Lord. The things, Lord, that you've laid on our hearts, but even within all that, you know how to bring it and to deliver it. We just Lord submit ourselves and may the same inspiration Lord may it move in our hearts and our lives Lord even in this moment continue to change us and transform us reach every heart and every life for your glory we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. We want to just open our Bibles if we could to First John chapter 5. And I want to read a few verses of scripture before we're seated here tonight. And uh want to mention to you I there's actually some things that developed between the time I sent out the calendar um and then uh last night or this morning rather. And so next Thursday night, Lord willing, brother Marcus Becker from Germany will be here with us. And um if you've never met Brother Marcus and or um just got a wonderful he got a wonderful spirit first of all. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's one thing I look for. &gt;&gt; is he has a wonderful spirit and um and uh he was able to put up with all my teasing at men's meetings some years ago and I would do the goostep and all of that. So, you know, but he's he's able to dish it right back. So, you kind of feel that out. You got to know your surroundings and what you can, you know, do because and but um he's got a real good spirit though and and just a real just so have enjoyed the different times I've been able to hear him and so I believe it'll be a great blessing to us as an assembly. And um so let's read here in the word in 1 John chapter 5 and verse one. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. Now, you'll watch how John will continue to tie this together because we know that there's a depth to that even in the first part of verse one. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. And yet we re we recognize is that it's more than just what a person could actually say, well I believe. But yet believing you must believe and there is a beginning to believing. But yet believing itself is not being born again. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The Bible says man believeth with the heart and confession and believeth unto salvation. So there is it all starts with faith and believing. But then there's the evidence and one of the things how John will continue to write this. Everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. So it's absolutely impossible to be born of God and not love the brethren. &gt;&gt; But first of all, you've got to be part of the brethren. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; By this, watch this. By this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandments. I think that's to me is really striking how John would write that. By this we know that we love the children of God. when when h how do I know that I'm actually in that right state of even where I'm to be is when we love God. Well, how do we declare that we love God? Well, the life that we live, but it's even in just the simple daily expressions in our life of prayer, &gt;&gt; devotion, Lord, I love you. Right? &gt;&gt; Just being in the house of God. Just simple little things. That's just it just expressions. I mean, imagine if if a home there was no expressions of love. This it's not just something that's reserved for a certain time, but it's throughout the time. And that's how that it is between Christ and a believer. By this we know we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not grievious. In other words, they're not borome. &gt;&gt; They're not ah I guess I have to do this or I they're not grievious. &gt;&gt; You see what what makes the difference? It's not that the word changes. It's when our nature changes. And when our nature changes, even how God will bring things to attention to our lives, it might be things that are would still be lingering here or there. And then God's rubbing that out of our life and then quickly that spirit of God on the inside will always agree with the word. And that includes even in character as God works on our character. Because when the Holy Spirit has come into our life by way of the new birth, we understand that the new birth is not the adoption, &gt;&gt; but the new birth itself is the beginning as we grow into full adoption. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So then with with all of that, there's many times within character and things that God will work out in our lives over time. And sometimes God just knows how to get us into a place that certain character trait can go for a long, long time &gt;&gt; and keep the same things keep on being repeated over and over. And finally, God gets it to a place, trust me, I've watched this and I've seen it not just by experience, but I've watched it also as a pastor. And finally, God will bring it to a place to where a person is actually able to see, I need to overcome this. &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful for God's grace for that. &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you something, you can be healed and physically in your body and if God carries, you'll get sick again. &gt;&gt; You might even be privileged to walk on the water, but if you come to that place, even in your character, little by little, that's lasting. Because when this when the rapture take place or if you go by the way of the grave, you don't take any of the water you walked on. &gt;&gt; But what you take with you is character. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. And that whole word precious is the actual taking the precious minerals &gt;&gt; that would be within the earth. &gt;&gt; You don't take all the dirt. People don't go to the museums and say, "Wow, look at the dirt that that was around that piece of gold. Look at that stream." No, it's the gold. &gt;&gt; You don't pay a lot of money for the dirt, yet we put gold on dirt. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But it's the gold. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Love you tonight and the Lord and pray that the Lord will just come by our way in a special way and speak to our hearts. I want to open here with that quote that we were looking at in that of becoming love and just dealing even thinking of that first phrase whosoever believeth that Jesus that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Watch how brother Brandham would place this. He says now we know drinking and carrying on is sin but the whole thing is because of unbelief. Because if you believe God and Jesus Christ to be his son, you are absolutely not going to do those things. He said, "You believe that he that's born of God does not commit sin." He says, "You must believe. The whole thing lays in faith." Jesus said, "He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but already passed from death into life." He said, ' Do you believe that's the truth? There it lays. There isn't nothing else that you can do. Only believe. And if you believe, then them little immoral things will just drop off like that. That's why brother Ram would say over and over, "Well, I quit this." Brother Ram says, "Well, if you quit it," he said, "you could, but when when God comes and begins to deal with your life, God himself will bring the quitting within your life. So notice he says, "Then them little immoral things will just drop off like that." It's like, remember how you see different trees, some trees, I think it's beach trees and things like that. Some of them will hold on their leaves for a long time. They'll even hold on them. Sometimes some of the beach trees, they'll hold on through the winter, but you just let new life come up. You don't have to go out to the woods out here because there's beach trees, those things grow so fast, you know, and you really don't want to be around them because they'll fall over, too. But the beach trees, if you just give it time in the spring, when the life comes up, those dead leaves, you don't have to pluck them off. They'll fall off because the life coming up will actually cause them to fall off. That's really the same way it is within the life of a believer. It's just taking in and just believing and taking in that word and applying it to our lives. And notice he says those little immoral things will drop off. And as you believe, you become love and love is God. and you begin to wind yourself into Christ. And then these other things, you don't have to quit doing them. They just quit themselves. There's just no desire to do it. And the worshipper once purged has no more conscience or desire of sin. And there in the orange, when the worshipper is purged is when he's born again. When his old nature dies and a new nature sets in. And you become an offspring of God in the green. And God can't hurt you without hurting himself. I want you to notice brother Bram never said we become loving or lovely. Yet that is an expression or what can come forth but it's actually to become a part of God to become love. The Bible says God is love. Now, there's no way that that can actually take place without the real true experience of the Holy Ghost within our lives coming down there to the soul, which will actually be the word of God himself, the spirit of God coming in the form of the word that will actually begin to take residence within our life. So, there's no way that a person can actually be born again and say, "Well, I I love the brethren." and and indeed they would have maybe a love, but yet if the love within what they're proclaiming is the love that God has set forth for the brethren, but yet they're not walking in the word, they're not living within that word, there's not there's not that of the spirit of truth really abiding in their life, then they've not reached that degree. They can have a file love, but remember, felio love is a friendship love, and it'll only hold out as long as the conditions allow it to hold out. But when those conditions break away, it's gone as well, too. But this is why there's got to be something greater in our lives. God never stripped away feeling of love because there's still that feeling of love that you have for your your children, you have towards your wife, even that which would be expressed to that of our brothers and sisters. But it cannot be limited to just fileio. It must be under the influence of agape love. And this is why we need the Holy Spirit in our lives. Not just to be able to get along with one another, but actually to get along with ourselves. We need the spirit of God working on our lives. He's dealing with our hearts. And then when the Holy Spirit has come into our life, as the prophet tells us, you become love. You become a part of God. You become a part of the word. You become love. So within that and of the substance that would be present in our life. I want to just uh deal here uh tonight and just continue to speak on that thought on becoming love. Now when you look at this within the scriptures to understand of how that God himself would come down, how that love God is love and God would come down to become one of us. What what does the Holy Spirit then when it comes into our life, what does it actually produce? Well, look at how that God himself clear back in the beginning, God before there was atom, time, molecule, before the devil was ever even created. But God in his mind, he dwelt alone with his thoughts. Now, within that of his thoughts, I don't want you to think that thoughts were just as though there was just like a collection of thoughts, but yet to understand that that perfect and complete thought was of God himself becoming tangible. As a matter of fact, brother Ram tells us in future home that when God thought of becoming tangible or flesh, he thought of me and you. And then the prophet would tell us there was a Moses, there was a Jeremiah. All of them in their own time would be expressed. But yet here came the Lord Jesus, which would be God made flesh, who was the perfect and complete thought of God. And so every one of us chosen in him before the foundation of the world, we were there in him. So within that thought of himself becoming tangible and I want you to see it like this. Brother Ram tells us in the message adoption he says that Jehovah himself think of it. He says existing with his family. Now I want you to look at it like this. It's not just Jehovah here and his family there but Jehovah is a family. &gt;&gt; It's God becoming it's God in every one of our lives. So it's not God here and then us there, but it's actually God himself dwelling in the very midst of his the hearts of his people. Remember God said there to Israel, let him make me make me a tabernacle that I may dwell in the midst of them. So it's God dwelling with his family. God has longed as the prophet, I believe, says it like this in Christ the mystery, he loved fatherhood. And so God's desire was to so be able to have fellowship with his his children. There were those alonging within him. But in order for that to be fulfilled, there had to be the right bedding ground. And we know sin came along and it it was hindering it was blocking that from the expression. But then how that God came down and became one of us in order to pay the price and make a way back. I love how the prophet says it in wings of a dove. He talks about that dove falling in the camp and he said, "Oh," he said, "It wasn't a dove that fell in our camp, but it was one who came from home and he came down from home." You see what it was? It's that how God himself having those of his children that would be here in this earth and we were trapped in the conditions and the lives and where we were at. that God came down and become one of us that he might release us and bring us back into fellowship with him. I I want you to see this of even this expression through the scriptures on how that God himself coming down and the love that is expressed among that of and between and in the lives of his children. In Isaiah 14:13 it says for thou hast said in thine heart this is Lucifer here his expressions of his heart I will ascend into heaven and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God or this phrase means Messiah's brothers. So then we see how that when God would become one of us, think about even in just one of the places of the resurrection, Jesus after he had raised, remember it had went from being servants to friends, the relationship now after the resurrection, go tell my brethren &gt;&gt; the the the price has been satisfied and I ascend unto my God and your God. Touch me not unto my father, your father. And we know that then as it goes into Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this conforming to the image was not that we would be the same stature as the body or the flesh of God that we would know that had took upon where God was able to descend and take upon the form or the human name of Jesus. It was not to make us like the prophet said to where in our physical we would bear a reflection of the physical image. He said, "But from our souls, we actually would bear the divine characteristic of his own nature." So he might be the firstborn among among many brother. In other words, he was the forerunner as Paul would say it. He was the witness of what is coming. And so what would that be? It would be now to where deity itself would not just come and move upon men like the prophets, but deity would absolutely tab tabernacle once again inside of flesh just as they knew it in the garden of Eden. What made Adam and Eve one in the garden of Eden? What was it that made them one with God? The prophet said, "What made them one with one another is because they were one with God." and being one with God, then they were one with another and there was a fellowship. And that's why the prophet said if there's something in a family or something in a home that is actually driving or breaking it apart, it shows that something is not right. So God's desire was is that that image would be there within our lives and that's how we're really united. Do you realize that even within that of a marriage, listen to me now because I'm not going to go here tonight on this, but do you realize in a marriage what actually is to hold you together? It's not something about that they're pleasing to you as though that everything is going around. Conditions are just right. Conditions will change. Not just physically, but even things hormonally, even things will change in our body. But this is one thing that must be there and that is the revelation that this is my mate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So within that revelation that's what the prophet said in marriage and divorce when that revelation whatsoever God hath joined together let man put us under. Let me just tell you something. If the devil God's not let me just tell you something. God's not going to put in your mind and bring confusion to you and run you in the ground with the word divorce. God hates divorce. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Now, I'm not talking about somebody staying around in an abusive situation or whatever more, but I'm talking about that God is not the one that facilitates that. He doesn't even drive people away from his presence. It is people themselves that make that kind of a decision. You say, "What do you work off of?" I'll tell you what you got to work off of. You've got to work off of that revelation that God placed in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And shut out all other voices. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we are real believers in this hour. I do not need secular advice from secular Christianity. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They will lead to everything itself. They will try to propagate so much. You go to listen to that, fear will set into your life. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you've got to come. This is where you have to resolve and reside on something deeper in your life. And what are you talking about? I'm talking about the love of God that God is watching over my life. And even within that within our homes, it should be even that of a of a revelation in our heart. Well, they're not a believer. Let me just tell you something. Let me just let me just give you a news flash. They might never be a believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't mean to shatter anybody's confidence, but let's just say it like that. What if they never are? Will that change your love? &gt;&gt; No. No sir. No sir. &gt;&gt; God listen God loves he he came. The Bible said for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. God's expression of love. But what matters is only those of the elect will be able to receive the depth that he expresses it for that of a mate. &gt;&gt; Yet there'll be many others that can capture that and they experience salvation. They can experience it even to that depth and actually benefit from many of the attributes of love that they're able and able to capture from just a certain depth of salvation. What a marvelous thing. &gt;&gt; I mean, what a marvelous thing that even that God would provide hospitals, doctors, and surgeries. You know why? His desire is to see people well. &gt;&gt; He wants to see the atheists well. &gt;&gt; See, God's not conditional. Well, they don't believe me. So, I'm telling you, they're in the last in the line. &gt;&gt; That's not God. &gt;&gt; You see, that's our conditional. &gt;&gt; God's not conditional. I'm glad for that because how many times you and I have we before God really got a hold of our life, how many times did we push it out? How many times did we push it off? How many times even since we have been serving God, he's been long-suffering with us as a faithful husband? &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. He didn't kick us to the curb. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz if he did that, he'd hurt himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's put up with you and me. You know why? Cuz we're a part of him. And God didn't going around gathering the angels and saying, "Hey, let me tell y'all something. I I'm telling you, Paul, you would not believe this. God don't go around and complain about you. &gt;&gt; How in the world did I get here? God does not go around. That creates an atmosphere. You know what the prophet said? He said in uniting time and sign. When you complain, you weaken faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're wanting, oh, I want I want Brother Samuel to lay hands on me, man. This is going to go away. You have work to do in your own life. Say, God, let my tongue, let my mouth be so guarded by the love of God. I don't want to complain. Yeah, there's a lot of things to complain about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Let us have a powerful and positive confession. He is the apostle and high priest of our profession." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many know it's true? &gt;&gt; You confess negative things, words carry spirits. &gt;&gt; Right? You go to talking critical there on your job. Watch. There'll be not a lot of other buzzards come around too because there's a lot of other people that'll join right in with that spirit. What does that was? There a memo set out. Hey, hey, over this cute cubicle right here. We're getting ready to grill the boss. We're getting ready to fry him, blister him, butter him up. We're Hey, why don't y'all join over here for a good barbecue on the boss? What does that how does all that get over here and all of a sudden there is just a gathering standing there? What does that spirits? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, I'm a child of God. Do you mean that I can get under the influence of a spirit? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely sir. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said when he was getting into a place when different ones were coming off a plane talking about a Allen talking about different ones in India word made flesh he said I begin to realize forming up in me was a critical spirit. At the end of that message he said I want you to pray for me. God will deliver me of this selfish spirit that's come around my life. It's a critical spirit. Everybody said &gt;&gt; I got a lot more quotes like that, but I'm not that's not for tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't even have it in any of the upcoming outlines. But I'm just I'm saying these things are placed within there so that you and I you know why those things are placed in there? It doesn't give the believer a loophole. You know what it does to a real child of God? It gives you and I strength because you recognize by the word, wait a minute here, that on the inside is who I am. It's repelling. It's resisting that even when you have fallen in that kind of a of a stuper right there, you can't remain there. Why? That's why the prophet said that being in God's mind gives you an eternal quality that you cannot get away from. &gt;&gt; That's why a backslider cannot remain content out there. This is why that even in your life you cannot take even joy and satisfaction with worldly things because you were not meant to be employed or service to worldly things. You were meant to serve the will of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God for his grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; We're sheep, aren't we? &gt;&gt; And we sure need the shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. firstborn among many brethren. My my. Hebrews chapter 2 verse1 17. Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like his brethren that he might be merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of his people. So why did he become one of us? It was him. &gt;&gt; His love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's who he is. That's what brought him down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was his love for what? For his children. &gt;&gt; And yet, how many people are benefiting because of his love for his elect? &gt;&gt; I'll just be honest with you, that don't bother me a bit. &gt;&gt; It don't bother me a bit that somebody experiences salvation of that degree. I thank God for that. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Right. It's like I've said before, if we're swimming in the pool and my daddy I'm drowning and somebody else is drowning and my daddy pulls me out of the pool, I'm his son. pulling me out of the pool didn't change me. But if he pulls my friend out of the pool that's drowning, he's he didn't become a son, but at least he's not drowning no more. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? This is something I could rejoice in. I don't say, "Why did you do No, no. We can rejoice in that part of God's saving grace. &gt;&gt; My his brethren." So, this is where he's coming. It's it's kinship. It's kin folks. It's God himself becoming one of us. Notice when we look at this here how the prophet I love how he says it here in God's provided place of worship in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily where we in there are sons and daughters to God in God's godhead as sons and daughters were in the family if you're in there &gt;&gt; now coming in there does not put us in the family but it brings us into the relationship ship through and by the blood that was shed. And the spirit of God has made it real to us as the Bible says by one spirit we are all baptized into one body. And then in there well you say what what happens in there? Well then coming in there see the love that would reach out to us. Think about this as young people or different ones that coming around you know believers. What's being expressed even as everybody there can there's such you know at times look every in every church there's you know all there's three kinds of believers. But as I said, I'm I'm I'm not focused on who's what, who's this. I'm preaching and I'm standing on that everyone is a believer. Cuz you know what? I have no other information and I don't want any. And I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Because God knows even what you and I would be able to handle. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But see, God would would express God would express his life. And here when a person is actually comes to that place to where the love of God has so taken a hold of their life, it's led them into repentance, they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, their life has been cleaned up and sanctified and set aside from from all of the evil. And the spirit of God now comes to bring them into the body. Then here they are. They are dwelling in the very divine love itself. And within their life, within your life is the same love in your life that brought him down to you and brought him to deal with your life. That same love is now working and you become a part of the conduit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It's like a hose that's out here. You run from one end to the other. And if it's not long enough, you put another hose to it. &gt;&gt; The water don't change. Now that hose gets joined together. And what happens when God moves down there in our lives? We've been baptized in to the body of Christ. Remember, as a seed, you are a channel for the Holy Spirit now to operate through as a son and daughter of God. What does that make you then? It's God's love now being expressed through and in your life. You become a channel or a conduit for the love of God. &gt;&gt; So, we're in the family if you're in there. Now, watch how Peter would bring this about. He says in 1 Peter chapter 1:22, "Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit." So, the spirit is dealing and leading in lives and bringing us to that place in obedience. No. So obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren. Now watch how watch how he says this. See that you love one another with a pure heart fervently. So there's an aspect to it that even after that's come there's a stewardship that must be kept in our lives. Being born again. So how is this made possible? being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. So it's absolutely as the scripture has said you have obeyed the truth through the spirit unto what unfeign love of the brethren. So, not only have you come fully into obedience into the truth, the spirit has brought you there, but also with that arriving in this place, you have now come to the place of unfeigned love. In other words, it's not something that you have to pretend put on. Unfeign means it's not hypocritical. Now, I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands, but there's times for every one of us in here, even even as you're filled with the spirit of God, that sometimes you have felt like a hypocrite &gt;&gt; because you didn't have the certain feeling &gt;&gt; and yet you were doing what was absolutely required of you to do. And it was something that you were looking at the word and say God my feelings and things just aren't there right now but I am standing on your word and I will not allow this feeling to reside in my life. You know what that's called? Overcoming. &gt;&gt; This scripture here is not about light switches on the wall that all of a sudden where somebody does something that you don't agree with or somebody steps on your toes and automatically boom there's a switch that goes on. Oh but brother Samuel that switch is on all the time. You still have feelings and those feelings are not in your soul. Thank God you've got feelings. Brother Ram tells us, could you imagine what life would be like without feelings? &gt;&gt; But you see your feelings, listen to me, that's why we do not rest or reside upon our feelings because there's times you feel like a Christian and there's other times you don't feel like a Christian. So let's just use that example. So the times that you don't feel like a Christian, what do you do? Do you just do you just, you know, lay around and run back out in the world? You don't because you know why? You have no connection with the world when the Holy Spirit has come into your life. And you'll find yourself doing what? Pressing and getting down to pray. Pressing and reading your Bible. Putting on a tape. And you don't feel no more spiritual than a man in the moon. &gt;&gt; Anybody know what I'm talking about? But why are you doing that that's called a sacrifice? What is that that's causing you to do that? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It's what is down on the inside. You know, I'm not going to let my feelings keep me away. You may not have felt like coming to church, but you're not going to let your feelings dictate who and what you are. Your feelings are not you as a son and daughter of God. But the son and daughter of God is that expressed attribute &gt;&gt; on the inside. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Brother says in prodal, he said, I know a friend who will stick by you if you haven't got a penny. Jesus Christ, the son of God. I've been to a place where I had not sent. He loved me. He loved me just as much. If I wouldn't have had a penny as if he we' had a million dollars. He loves you just the same. Look at this. That pure, holy, unadulterated love comes from God alone down into his people. &gt;&gt; So, this isn't a love that we've mustered up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the obedience of the truth through the spirit unto unfeign love of the brethren. How does that become? Because now you are fully baptized into the body of Jesus Christ, the brotherhood. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory. Because he took part of flesh and blood like his brethren. &gt;&gt; You were always a son and daughter of God. We were always his brethren. But that relationship could not even be spoken of or requested until after the resurrection. And when he raised, he never said, "Go tell my friends." &gt;&gt; John 15, he called them friends. &gt;&gt; Right? Transition from servants. But after the resurrection, he said, "I ain't going to call you church. I'm going to call you bride." It was a change in relationship. &gt;&gt; Who was that that initiated that change? and would be able to actually bring about what was needed for that change to become an expression. It was God himself. Who is it that has brought about and initiated this change that you and I could be called sons and daughters of God in this hour? That Christ, the mighty angel, descended with an open book in his hand and begin to proclaim the rights of sons and daughters of God to rise in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he provided what was needed &gt;&gt; for us to become what the word was speaking over our lives. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. That pure, holy, unadulterated love comes from God alone down into his people. That's the way we should love one another with that godly love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This are you saying that sometimes feeling will never come? No, I'm telling you it'll come. It'll come. And you know what it'll come? It'll come from us submitting to the God who lives in us. &gt;&gt; It'll come. You know what it'll do within those times like that that get hard? Those are the times. You know what God permits that to do? What? He's getting more of the greenness out of our life. And God is also, it's driving us into the presence where we need to be. You know, God knows just how to actually mold and shape our lives. You know, let me tell you that many of the things that are birthed and born in our life, it can't be birthed or born without there being a death. You can never be born again unless you die to yourself. There's no way in the world that it can actually come forth of more of God in our life without us coming into situations that will lead us as a lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is led before her sheerers dumb. &gt;&gt; So that's good. &gt;&gt; Well, y'all think we can go on? Father God, we are so happy tonight to know that this group of people love us and we love them and all together we love you. And it's because of your love &gt;&gt; that we love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's because of his love. &gt;&gt; Now remember, loving one another doesn't mean that we see eye to eye. &gt;&gt; God's not even interested in us trying to persuade one another. &gt;&gt; God's not interested in that. that that's where the battle gets lost. It gets lost not only in church, it'll get lost in home life as well. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're all of a sudden going to make a transition into dinner and now bringing up what happened last night or this or that or a week ago and all of a sudden you might as well have put spoiled meat on the plate. You might as well just put a bunch of garbage on the plate and sit here. &gt;&gt; Why? You're bringing things up. Well, that that's got to be salt. No, what it is is that let God remedy it in your heart. &gt;&gt; Those things are test in your life. Let me tell you something, friends. Your marriage and all these other things, Lord have mercy, these are not things that you look at, well, if I can just get this out of the way, if I can just get this out of the way, if I can just get this out of the way. Do you realize God allows things for you and I to go through in order to bring things out in our lives? &gt;&gt; If we're looking for some sort of a picnic, God knows what will bring things out of our lives. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said in the message Exodus, he said, "Think of Moses and Zapora." He said Moses himself, meakest man in all the earth, but yet he had a temper. And he said his wife had a temper, too. He said, "No doubt sometimes there were things hot on the backside of the desert." &gt;&gt; Let me finish the quote. He said, "How do you know that God didn't give you that woman? That's your cross to bear." And also for the women, "How do you know that God didn't give you that man? That's your cross to bear." It may not be temper. It may be you having to pick up their dirty socks, pick up everything and everything else around them, and do everything else and use. Oh my, if I didn't have to sit around and pick this up, I might actually be able to get something done during the day. But God would allow that cross to be born for what purpose? To bring more of himself out of you and I. &gt;&gt; But it's when we fight against it, &gt;&gt; trying to pray it away &gt;&gt; instead of saying, "God, give me the grace &gt;&gt; to become what you want me and would have me to become." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's so good. &gt;&gt; Notice he says, "Even though you may be an unbeliever or skeptic, that don't keep me from loving you. I do it anyhow cuz it's not me that does the loving. It's the Lord Jesus in my heart &gt;&gt; that makes me love you." &gt;&gt; See, I love words like this. I should have I should have put that make in big gigantic letters. You know why? Because when God gave you and brought you in the will of God and he changed your nature, he never stripped away your self-will. &gt;&gt; Let me prove it to you. In the Garden of Eden, here after the Lord Jesus God come down into such a way in in among us, here he was in the Garden of Eden. Nevertheless, not my way. If it's possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will, thine will be done. You know what the prophet said? He said he was contending with himself. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, who do you contend with? &gt;&gt; Oh, brother say my wife. No, it ain't your wife. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother. It ain't your brother. &gt;&gt; It's how it bothers you. &gt;&gt; It's how it affects you. &gt;&gt; You're not contending with somebody else. This is why we need to call the devil's hand to it instead of pointing out like this is the enemy. This is not the enemy. The enemy is right here. &gt;&gt; This is our biggest enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you know what? If you didn't have feelings, it wouldn't bother you. &gt;&gt; But you have feelings. And thank God you've got feelings. &gt;&gt; But make sure you submit those feelings to God each and every moment of your life. My my my &gt;&gt; it's not me that does the loving. It's the Lord Jesus in my heart that makes me love you. I know some of you already read the quote ahead of me, but you're going to have to wait on me. And me as a man, I wouldn't do it. I I'd want to know why, when, and how. But the Christ in my heart says this is me. &gt;&gt; I died for that person. &gt;&gt; So it's all right. No matter what you do, I still love you anyhow. Not from my lips, from my heart. &gt;&gt; And every Christian does the same thing as long as Jesus abides in the heart. Right? &gt;&gt; Just as much as the spirit of God, the love of God in the heart of the prophet would not allow that critical spirit to remain there. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in another place, negative. He had become negative. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God would not allow that to remain in his life. &gt;&gt; To think about how that this will not allow those things remain. Remember when that rain came up there, &gt;&gt; right? Brother Bram sized him up. &gt;&gt; What was happening? The same kind of a reaction of when he walked through that pasture where that bull was. &gt;&gt; He was looking for his gun. &gt;&gt; It wasn't there. God seen to it. The prophet said he left it on the truck. &gt;&gt; Cuz if he'd had that gun, that have been one dead boy. See, God allowed him to be put in a situation where it was flesh and blood could not deal with it. &gt;&gt; You know why God did that? He didn't do that to lift up William Brandom. God was doing that to lift up himself before his children and say there are things even in your own life that will be difficult for flesh and blood. But that is where you will need to rely on me and I will step in. and I will take the battle. The battle is not yours, &gt;&gt; but the battle is mine, sayaeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; God did that for you and I. He allowed that to be recorded for you and I. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And every Christian does the same thing as long as Jesus abides in the heart. He said, "If you can just love those who love you while the sinners do the same thing." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, first part of this quote, I'll get to it in a minute. The first quot part of this quote, Brother Brham's rebuking the people for Pentecostal cussing. Pentecostal cussing. He's Yeah. This is what Brother Bram called Pentecostal cussing. Somebody's driving at you with their bright lights and you put your bright lights, you're going to drive right at them. Brother said that's Pentecostal cursing. &gt;&gt; Listen, listen, listen. Brother and sister, you understand? The word's calling us to a higher standard. &gt;&gt; That's why it's calling us to come up higher. &gt;&gt; And we're not coming, we're not hitting the ceiling. There's a door that's open. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? John heard a voice say, "Come up." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a door that's open. &gt;&gt; And rapture, let me just tell you, rapture is not something that's going to take place on a day. It's happening right now in your life. When the spirit of God begin to lead you through justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's God catching you away. What's he doing? He's catching you away from all of your senses unto himself. It's God continuing. And the rapture itself, rapture morning, will be a culmination of a life that's been lived daily and being caught away. Brother Samuel, what about my faults? What about my failures? What about my mistakes? Rapturing grace has come to catch you away because rapturing grace will not allow you to remain where he has never saw you to be. &gt;&gt; You were chosen before him in love. &gt;&gt; And so the way that he deals with you and speaks to your life, speaks to my life is based on that right there. He's never had a new thought of you. He's never had a new picture of you. That's exactly how he's working and dealing with your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know it's overwhelming, isn't it? It's overwhelming because we look at the person in the mirror the whole time. But I want you to understand the person you see in the mirror with all of his mistakes and failures. It's not the person that's there on that family album. The person that's on that family album is the real you that has a desire to please God more than anything else. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know it's y'all's fault if I don't get nowhere. If we can just love those who love you while the sinners do the same thing. But we are different when Christ has come into our heart. We love those who do not love us. Love the unlovable. And we were unlovable one time too, you know. And Christ loved us until we came to him. &gt;&gt; Now, just think about that for a moment. He loved us through everything until we come to him. He didn't stop. His love is unending. He's eternal. &gt;&gt; Through it all, he didn't say, "Walked out of a service again or they went away." He keeps on wooing. &gt;&gt; He keeps on working. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. And then if we be of Christ and Christ is in us, we have that same spirit of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And cooperation &gt;&gt; and helping oursel. Wait a minute. helping to try to move the great load and make life a little easier for ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; No, that must have been the self-living translation. And make life a little easier for our fellow man. That that's what the spirit of God does. &gt;&gt; Look how he comes to work in your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look what what's he done. He's come to lead us into fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He works in our life to bring about what? Cooperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. He works to do what? Make life a little easier. You know what? God comes down in services and there might be things that he, you know, and I'm not going to say that God puts things on the side, but God knows just what you and I have need of. And sometimes we have, oh Lord, this is my need. And yet God is looking at it really what the real need is. is not that first priority, but there's another need in your life to get you lifted up in your heart, in your spirit to where you can actually look by faith to receive what he already has done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; So, here there comes a real brotherhood. Let me just let me have just a few more moments because I know I'm not even going to get in going to get finished with this, but there comes a brotherhood. And a brotherhood is that of of a family of a kinship that it would be between a body of believers. Now, does God want us to would God does God want us to express love toward all? Well, yeah. I mean, there's not like a switch where you express a different kind of a love as say, you know, to where well, I'm not going to, you know, to to those that are that are that are out there in the world. No, we're we're to express love. But there should be among the family of God. Even even those that would proclaim and working their way into that place to be to come into that place with God and God is working on their lives. You know what? You know what? Even sometimes the things that we are looking at and where maybe you can look at a person and say, "Well, I ain't seen why they moved or I ain't seen this or I ain't seen this." You know what? God allows those things for you and I to pray. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; And for us to express love and encouragement. You want to encourage somebody, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You don't want to go and tear down, you know, somebody's trying to do something with art. You don't want to tear down what they're doing. You want to try to encourage them along. I'm not talking about building a false hope. But I'm talking about to be an encourager. Because after it all, the new birth is not a work of flesh and blood. It's not something we're chided into, not something we're rebuked into. But the divine love of God by the new birth is where the spirit of God draws out of a life a surrender to God. &gt;&gt; You never were born again because of condemnation. You were never born again because of malign treatment. You were born again when you finally could see the expression of God's love to you personally. And so sometimes God will allow things among a body and everywhere else to see. Do you have the patience you need? &gt;&gt; Do you have the love that you need? Oh, I tell you, we're right there at Capstone. We're right up there. Really? &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm just preaching to me. Maybe I'll just go look in a mirror, but I'll look at y'all behind me. John 13:34-35. This is familiar scripture. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another &gt;&gt; as I have loved you. Notice as I have &gt;&gt; the same degree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How is that possible? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because of his love. &gt;&gt; Because of the Holy Ghost. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; As I have loved you, that ye also love one another. And by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you mean we're not known to be disciples of God because we can explain the mysteries? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Because remember Paul said, "You can understand all mysteries and have not charity means nothing." &gt;&gt; What you saying, brother Samuel? I'm saying there's got to be something deeper than what's just up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can know all the mysteries, tie everything together, and this and that. Paul talked about it with gifts, but there's got to be a greater substance on the inside, and that of divine love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what means everything. &gt;&gt; The word of God by the spirit of God dwelling in our life by this. Because think about it. Think about it. Usually, it's very rare. You take times where people get offended at work. out here. Pink slip gone. &gt;&gt; See you. You didn't you didn't you didn't treat me right or this or that. We understand those pressures. All of us understand those pressures. &gt;&gt; There's times when I worked within teaching and and some of the places I've been some of the days, boy, I'll tell you what, some things get hard. They get you know what you you go to just thinking about something one time as though that oh that ain't that bad and that pressure that brother or sister. Go ahead and start thinking like that. God will make sure you understand that. Uh-huh. That's right. &gt;&gt; God will make sure you understand it. He's not trying to rub our nose in it, but he wants you to understand that this pressure, you may not be built in a certain way. Maybe there's certain complexes that you don't have. Although we all have complexes, but there might be certain things that you're not dealing with that will have to be worked out in that person and that individual's life just as much as there's things in our lives. But it still comes down to the place to where when we're looking at all of this and to be able to just submit our hearts and our lives to God and for God to work out his perfection, his his his will within our lives. And we we look at this and think my as I have loved you to that same degree &gt;&gt; and by this shall all men know you're my disciples. Remember among the early church when the strangers and different ones were around them the testament was behold brother tells about in a church age book behold how they love one another because you know what let me just tell you something it takes work when there's differences &gt;&gt; and you know what it's easier just to say, "See you. &gt;&gt; I'll go to another church. &gt;&gt; I'll go to another job." &gt;&gt; Don't worry, problems will find you there as well. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what? Every church is made up of multiple dispositions of people. &gt;&gt; But there's one nature or disposition that's to be the predominating factor, &gt;&gt; and that's to be the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Trust me, I've been in multiple churches, rub shoulders in certain churches with more and many of the people and they are as different as night is today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They have people in there that you know that don't I mean it's just like hey I mean hey you know it's just their personality their makeup it don't matter. Then you have other people that everything has got to be down to a certain line all within the same church. So it isn't that God puts together, oh this group of people, they're all natured alike. No, &gt;&gt; what kind of a victory would that show? &gt;&gt; Really, that's what the Holy Ghost come to do is make us all alike. Come on. I've been preaching on this for a while now. &gt;&gt; That's not victory. But victory is where we can be as different as night today in our makeup, but have the love of God in our hearts. It's the love of God that joins us together, not how much we see alike. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. It wasn't until after my wife and I got married that I realized how different we were. &gt;&gt; I don't say that in a bad way. So, I hope that didn't come out that way. &gt;&gt; But you know what? God has to teach had to teach this guy. How in the world tonight I'm not even planning on this, but God had to teach this guy how to be a servant. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; God had to teach me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. Boy, I thought I had it all when I went into marriage. I thought I knew it all. What a knucklehead. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about me. I'm talking me. me me. How foolish I was. That's why you want to run to people and talk about they're going to talk about how they're going to raise their kids in Americ [Laughter] &gt;&gt; because you're not even there yet to experience it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; Maybe we can just stand and sing When the Saints Go Marching In. This is not coming out like I thought it would. &gt;&gt; By this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another. These things I command you that you love one another. &gt;&gt; And notice how this phrase, you'll find this same phrase in that verse, this verse, and all the way through the book of John. &gt;&gt; Love one another. So it's not just something that's to beep &gt;&gt; like sonarep love one another. You see there has to be something that's there of a corresponding part &gt;&gt; that is able to actually catch that love and be able to reciprocate it. Let me leave you with this scripture. We love him because he first loved us. &gt;&gt; So, so what happened as we begin to believe, we become love. &gt;&gt; So, as the spirit of God being projected in our life and it brings us to that place till now, we're not loving God with our spirit &gt;&gt; because the affection gate is a gate in the spirit. But we're loving God with his own love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is why that Paul would write, "Who shall separate us &gt;&gt; from the love of God?" See, when that when that has when that has come into that place within the heart of a believer, what can separate you? Paul said pearls would come, distresses, all sorts of things will take place, but nothing can take the place of the love of God. Oh, yeah. You might get down. That's right. Sometimes you might talk negative like man alive. I mean it seems like it's raining cats and dogs are running more. That's just this outer realm. &gt;&gt; But you see the greatness of the love of God on the inside. You know what? You might even get and say get so down and weary you're not even here on Thursday night. You don't show up to a Sunday morning service. But let me tell you something. If the love of God is in your heart, you can't stay that way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't stay that way. &gt;&gt; It'll it'll bring you right back to the fold because what is it? It's not about this building. It's about the brotherhood. It's about getting together with the body. And that's why the prophet said in the message shalom, he said, when more of the believers get together, it's more of the godhead bodily right among us. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, what gives you that strength to force or propel beyond differences, beyond your feelings? It's the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; What was it when Noah did what he did? What was it that allowed the Lord Jesus even after the fall in Eden? What was it that brought him down? His love for his fallen creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Noah died a drunk, &gt;&gt; the love of God did not stop there. I love how the brother Ram says in the message, Masterpiece, he said God was not about to let his creation lay there in ruins. He said he went to work to build a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; And when God built this great masterpiece of the Lord Jesus Christ, what would he be? He would be the word expressed. How does the word come through and by the prophets? It would be word on top of word on top of word on top of word. It would not just be some say thou Jeremiah. Some say you're Elijah. Some say this. He was the complete thought of God expressed the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he had to have the right pedestal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God put that pedestal in such a way. Abraham, the election of God, Isaac, the love of God. &gt;&gt; Then it would come to that of Jacob. And I love how Brother Bram calls it Jacob. You know what I love, brother Carlos? I love how God even on Mount Carmel, I don't know these little things like this, brother Aaron mean a lot to me. How that God within that he just he did not neglect Jacob and just say Israel. &gt;&gt; But God when he was assembling all that together &gt;&gt; on Mount Carmel, you know why? He was recognizing there's still Jacob, but the Israel is what's inside of Jacob. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And what is it that will bring deliverance? The fire of God. What is it that brings deliverance in your life? The fire of God, the Holy Spirit. What is it even today, right as you're sitting right here under the midst of maybe a hard trial? What is it that's giving you strength today? It's the fire of almighty God igniting that Israel inside of this Jacob [Music] &gt;&gt; drives you on, encourages you, encourages you. You don't feel like coming my here you are. You find yourself putting your towel on if you were on one or whatever it was and you find yourself here you are sitting in the pew and you're thinking how in the world did I get here? What was it? I'm asking you what is it that moved you beyond your feelings. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what that is. That's a love of God. &gt;&gt; It's that same love if you can see it is the same love of God that would not allow him to stop with Noah. He kept on going and brother Brandon when he says Jacob he said everybody knows Jacob means grace. You just have to read a little bit of Jacob's life. It ain't nothing but the grace of God. Then he goes on he says now that fourth one on there was that of Joseph perfection. God notice it was the four pedestals. Four being that of life and how that he set his word upon what? Election, love, grace and perfection. Let me tell you, you are positioned in Christ in the elective love of almighty God. And it is grace that is swept down in your life. And it's grace that continues to work and give you strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leading from that perfection of his own life &gt;&gt; that leads you to perfection. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us, your children, your children disappointed you sometimes. Maybe your children or somebody, maybe a spouse or whatever. Well, there ain't no angels here, &gt;&gt; but we've disappointed one another. &gt;&gt; I won't ask you to raise your hands, &gt;&gt; but how many of you said things you had to go back and repent for? Lord, it's amazing we don't see hands flying up in the feet and flying up in the air. &gt;&gt; You know why? It's not an excuse. &gt;&gt; But what is it that would even drive you to that? What is it that would not even allow you for that to remain? &gt;&gt; Disagreements will come. &gt;&gt; What is it that won't allow you? &gt;&gt; It wasn't because you were taught good in kindergarten. &gt;&gt; Many times a lot of kids in school, tell them you're sorry. Sorry. It's &gt;&gt; going to work real good on the plat on the playground next time, huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. Better keep one of them in. &gt;&gt; Either that or you better be out there on duty cuz it that that ain't nothing genuine about that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. It's reciprocal. that love working within the body. It's the love of God. It's the love of God from your heart that it would make you I I know listen friends things that God even as I've prayed I you know when I pray and I minister on this say God help me to understand it how you're revealing it right now &gt;&gt; because I'm not these things. I'm not I'm gonna preach I'm not preaching by memory. The Holy Spirit will bring things back, quotes and things like that that I don't even have up here and and the way he'll bring things together. It's not by memory. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, there's even things the way God will pull pull things back by layers and I can look at it and I can honestly say, I never seen it like this before. &gt;&gt; And that's true. &gt;&gt; But it's God because you know why? The same God that is working in your life is the same God working in my life. So, it's not like, you know, in school where you got a teacher who's up here teaching and they're 35 years old and they're teaching nine year olds to, you know, do whatever they're supposed to do. Trying to remember now, algebra and different some beginning things. This person's already been through it. Right? &gt;&gt; But to think about it, no wonder said no wonder Paul said through the foolishness of preaching, God would take men that are imperfect and God works in their lives and as he's bringing things even down into their lives and working in their hearts, there's things that God is opening and showing us and it's for the benefit. &gt;&gt; And it's not just about well me, but it's God working within each of our lives. And that's why I can come to the end or not really to the end but come to a stopping point here and say Lord bring me to that degree help me Lord Jesus because you know what there's things over time in our lives when Paul would write there's many other lot more scriptures I wanted to get into here tonight when Paul would say of how that we're to love one another charity out of a pure heart and yet The heart itself is grounds that must be kept because the heart itself remember Jesus would say if you don't from your heart forgive. It's kind of like taking a hose and you know I bought one of these hose I think it was last year if I'm right honey. You know I got tired of them big old rubber hoses. I had a good rubber hose there. But man, that thing pulling that out in the yard to water my trees. It was you just want to leave leave it there. But then you have dead marks in your grass if you leave it there. So I had the bright idea of one of these fabric ones, you know, that start out about this small and swell out. Let me tell you something. That thing didn't even last a year. &gt;&gt; And it end up with pin holes in it and everything else. I'd set out there at the end and you know how you do with a hose because you don't want to you're like I'm done walked out here already. I ain't going back up there and but you know what you why why why are you doing this even with your rubber hose? Why are you doing that? Cuz you know there's water. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've already turned on the water and I know there's water. So what you know between me and the water source that's where the problem's at. All right. &gt;&gt; And so sometimes when we look in our lives, it's constant, constant, constant, and say, "Lord, let my heart stay free as a channel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's something that's, you know, it's just like a little trickle that's coming out. Listen, God wants to express his love through your life. So, he won't keep it from you, but he'll help you see. And God don't sit there and let me take him around this bin. Let me take him around. let me try to get the kink out. But you know what God will do? He'll walk right down in our life. &gt;&gt; And he'll say, "This is where it's kinkedked." &gt;&gt; But when he does that, you know what the whole thing is? It loosens us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Say amen to the word of God. And you know how it is when that when that hose that kink gets leaned out all of a sudden go the water starts coming out like that. And that's how after you set in the service like this and say, "Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." He begins to go down in your life and tomorrow it will be like maybe the next day and here's water coming out and then all of a sudden you be like a gush and then it goes what is it? There's it's getting that air out of the line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't mean that. It doesn't mean that oh nothing must have happened. No, no, things did happen. &gt;&gt; What it is he's pushing out &gt;&gt; all of that &gt;&gt; got between. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Oh, let's pray. Lord Jesus, I just know Lord that Father, you are mindful of our needs, Lord, even to so speak to our hearts and help us. And I pray that God, Lord, if there's something that I've missed in some way tonight, maybe something that Lord that maybe an example here or there that may have helped someone, I I've got confidence, Lord, in you cuz I didn't even have any of these examples or nothing even wrote here in the few pages I've got through. But may you come, Lord. That's where my hands are up to you and this congregation, Lord Jesus. Make me more like you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord God, we want our hearts to be clear, free channels, Lord, that are open, surrendered, submitted. Help us, Lord. May God by your spirit, Lord, just come down, Lord, and continue to deal and work in our lives, Lord. The sacrifices that's made tonight, my brothers and sisters, each one of us, Lord, we didn't come here to be seen. They've come, Lord, from working, their jobs, laboring, and coming into an evening service like this. They love you, Lord. They want to serve you, want to serve you better. I pray that Lord God help us Lord &gt;&gt; Lord give us the wisdom give us the strength Lord the grace even Lord in every area of our life help us Lord dear God as different places you took us tonight and bringing out things with marriage and other things Lord God help us Lord Jesus we're an imperfect people Lord We need you, Father. &gt;&gt; We need you. We need your grace and your strength, Lord. Help us, Lord. Lord God, like your prophet would describe that little boy trying to put on that coat. Many times, Lord, that's how we feel. [Music] &gt;&gt; Getting one arm in and then we're struggling to get our other arm in. But oh God, may we just take that hand and put it in your hand and say, "Father, you guide me into the sleeve." That's our heart's desire, Lord. You We don't want to It's not us to try to figure it out. We want to submit, Lord. We want to surrender. Help us, God. I pray if there's one here tonight that has not maybe even by under the sound of my voice going through streaming or archive Lord and they not come into that place Lord into the body to where that oh they they're around it they experience the love among the body and the saints reaching out to him Lord God and how that when they come around the greeting and so forth but yet Lord God to really know the love of God that loosens the grip of unbelief within their heart Lord God to wear Lord Jesus the attributes of sin just flee out of their life. Lord God, grant it. Lord, tonight I pray that you would lead them. May they Lord God have that of the courage to Lord Jesus under the presence of divine love to say, Lord God, take me there. Lead me there, Lord God. That's what I want in my life, Lord God. I just don't want to come into the house of God and sense the love of God. But I, Lord God, I want to be, Lord, a very product. I want to become love &gt;&gt; to where the love of God It's on display in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once I was a sinner, but now I'm an express son of God. Beneath that darkness, I was always a son, but the darkness has broke. The day has dawned, the sun has rose, and sons and daughters of God are rising. Lord Jesus, thank you for your word. Thank you for your mercy, Lord. Father, I pray tonight, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for making it real plain to us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We're thankful for the love of God in our hearts. As the prophet told us in many examples, the love of God would stand right up in our hearts and say, "Wait a minute. That's a person. That's one that I died for." Lord Jesus, how we're so thankful for the love of God. [Music] I'm not just thankful that you changed my nature, but I'm so thankful that you rise from within me and you won't let me get by with nothing. Correction comes to our lives. Lord God, I want to say thank you. Anybody else want to join me tonight and say thank you, Lord? &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for the Holy Spirit that convicts me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So thankful for the spirit of God that'll correct me. &gt;&gt; Because Lord, like your prophet told us, when you discipline us, you do it with a vision in mind. You're bringing us back home. One of these days, one of these moments, cuz we're living in the harvest time, character &gt;&gt; will be harvested from this earth and rapture. The great combines of God sweeping by to draw us up into his presence. Help us, Lord. Like your prophet said in another place, he said, "Lord, continue to work in our lives. Bake all the greenness out of us, Lord. Bring us, Lord, to the place until we become the bread on your table." Glory be to God. Not only Lord when we set that day at the marriage supper of the lamb and then as the fulfillment of you said I will not drink fruit of the vine until then and as we sat down there at the marriage supper of the lamb think about it even in memorial as we'll be partaking of the bread and of the wine and yet what will be setting there at the marriage supper of The lamb is the very bread of life himself that was given in order to bring life to us. &gt;&gt; No wonder Paul could liken us as a body. We are one bread, one bread, one body. Lord Jesus, help us, Lord. Help us, Lord God. Lord God, from marriages, Lord, every one of us, we need, Lord, your strength. Help us, oh God, brethren, Lord, ministries all the way through, Lord, help us not to make differences the focal point. Grant it, Lord. Grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not even to give that a point of conversation. Because to talk about differences among brethren is not edification to the body. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. I pray God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a victory, Lord, that divine love is producing and will achieve in our lives. A people that can be as different as night is from day. But our nature has been changed and we're united by the love of God from our soul. walking in the brotherhood of believers. It's not a click. It's not a clan, but it's the body of Jesus Christ. Help us, Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Fill my way every day with love as I walk with the head. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with a hug. Let me walk blessed Lord in the way thou has gone leading straight to the land above. Oh, giving cheer everywhere to the sand. Fill my way every day with love. Fill my way every day with love. Oh, as I walk, [Music] &gt;&gt; oh, let me go &gt;&gt; with a song. &gt;&gt; Fill my way. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. She me close to the sun. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the key, Father. &gt;&gt; In darkness ro [Music] my free from wrath and my soul satisfied. Oh, fill my everyday with love. Oh, fill my way every day. &gt;&gt; With love as I walk with the hat. Let me down. Just let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Yes, Lord. Soon the race will be over and I'll travel no more but abide in my home above. Oh let me sing blessed king all the way to that shore. Fill my way every day with love. Oh, fill my way every day with love. Oh, as I walk with the head, turn me down. Oh, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with one more time. Fill my way, Lord. Fill my way every day with your love. Hallelujah. Oh, as I walk with a heading down. Help me, Lord. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Yes. Fill my way every day with love. [Music] Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. Falling love. Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. Oh, I'm in his arms tonight. Oh, in his arms I feel protected. In his arms, never disconnected. [Music] In his arms. Oh, I feel Yes, sir. There's no place I'd rather be. Oh, falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. [Applause] Falling in love with Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. Oh yes, it was the best thing I've ever done. Testify one last time. It was the best thing I've ever done. [Music] Just this one little chorus where we go. I love you, my Lord, with all of my heart. You are my everything. You're the reason I sing and I love you. I love you, my Lord. Sing it again. I love you, my Lord. Yes, I love you, my Lord, with all of my heart. You are my griefing.
