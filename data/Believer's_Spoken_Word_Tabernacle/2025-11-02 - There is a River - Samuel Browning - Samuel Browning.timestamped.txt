[41:14] always good to see your faces and and um
[41:18] it's kind of hard to do that online, but

[41:22] it that way, but it's always good to be
[41:25] together.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and uh we certainly need we
[41:30] need him.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; We need to hear from him. We we each
[41:34] have needs, but just if we can have just

[41:40] &gt;&gt; And then just to let our needs just just
[41:44] be presented [music] before him and can

[41:51] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Even of things that [music] God would

[41:59] &gt;&gt; To be able to go forward and do that.

[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to say it is so good
[42:04] to be together and um
[42:08] we just want to go to the Lord in a word
[42:09] of prayer.
[42:14] Amen. I wonder as our heads are bowed.
[42:18] No doubt there's I know there's many
[42:20] requests, but maybe individually it
[42:22] would say, "Lord, you know, you know my
[42:25] need, Lord." And just with an uplifted
[42:28] hand, Lord, [music]
[42:29] just speak to my heart this morning,
[42:31] Lord. I I need to hear from you. I
[42:34] didn't come to hear a man. I come to
[42:36] hear from you, Lord.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. My hand is up with
[42:41] you,
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[42:44] Without
[42:47] you, we can do nothing.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; When you brought Zachchariah
[42:54] to that place, Lord, and he looked upon
[42:56] that
[42:57] candlesticks, oh God,
[43:00] and you spoke to him and he said it was
[43:04] as a man who was awakened out of sleep.
[43:09] He wasn't asleep, but yet you brought
[43:11] him Lord into
[43:14] a place, oh God, even by vision to speak
[43:17] to him.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And you asked [music] Lord of Him, what
[43:22] what do you see? And oh God, as a real
[43:25] servant of God,
[43:28] he said, "Thou knowest."
[43:30] And Lord, when you spoke to him, when he
[43:33] looked upon that, you said, "Not by
[43:36] might, nor by power,
[43:39] &gt;&gt; but by my spirit, saith the Lord."
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Oh God, this mountain shall be removed.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Now Lord, I'm asking for your grace just
[43:52] to continue to move, Lord, in among us
[43:55] this morning.
[43:57] May we too, Lord, as your servants, oh
[44:00] God, be as it were, may be awakened,
[44:03] Lord. May our eyes be so anointed, Lord.
[44:07] Not as though that we don't see, but we
[44:09] want to see you more clearly, Lord.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; There's needs upon hearts. There's
[44:14] desires. And we need to hear from you.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we need you to speak to us.
[44:22] So, we're asking, oh God,
[44:25] Lord, we have nothing to say to you or
[44:29] to tell you as to instruct you, but we
[44:32] do want you to know we love you. We
[44:35] appreciate you. And Lord, we're asking
[44:38] that you would come and speak to our
[44:40] hearts this morning. Minister to our
[44:43] lives, Lord. Help us, Lord, as we have
[44:47] praying, Lord, for one another. May you
[44:50] come, Lord God, specially to every need,
[44:53] Lord. You're no respector of persons,
[44:56] Lord.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; We could never merit
[45:00] &gt;&gt; your righteousness. We could never earn
[45:03] it, Lord. We could never even merit,
[45:06] Lord, you even coming and speaking to
[45:09] our hearts.
[45:11] So we stand here, Lord, this morning
[45:13] just to look to you in your sovereign
[45:16] grace and say, "Oh God, move upon my
[45:19] heart, Lord. Let my will, let all that
[45:23] is within me, Lord, let it just be so
[45:25] melted, Lord, in your presence, oh God,
[45:28] that you might, Lord Jesus, do and bring
[45:31] forth from us of your own life, Lord. We
[45:35] pray.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you this morning.
[45:42] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[45:51] Amen. If we could here this morning,
[45:55] I want to go to a passage of scripture
[45:58] in Psalms.
[46:03] And uh I want to say I heard that I got
[46:07] to see Josh as I was walking by back
[46:10] there. So it's good to have him here
[46:13] with us. And um [clears throat]
[46:21] I want to
[46:25] just uh read here this this portion of
[46:28] scripture and then we'll let you have
[46:30] your seats.
[46:34] The scripture says, "God is our refuge
[46:37] and strength,
[46:40] a very present help in trouble.
[46:44] Therefore
[46:46] will not we fear, though the earth be
[46:50] removed, and though the mountains be
[46:53] carried into the midst of the sea,
[46:56] though the waters thereof roar and be
[46:59] troubled, and though the mountains shake
[47:03] with the swelling thereof, sailor,
[47:07] why won't we fear? Because God is our
[47:10] refuge
[47:11] &gt;&gt; and strength, a very present help in the
[47:14] time of trouble. Verse four,
[47:18] there is a river,
[47:20] the streams whereof shall make glad the
[47:25] city of God, the most holy
[47:29] of the tabernacles
[47:31] of the most high.
[47:33] God is in the midst of her. She shall
[47:36] not be moved. God shall help her. And
[47:40] that right early.
[47:45] One more scripture before we're seated.
[47:47] And you don't have to turn here. We'll
[47:49] just read it from the screen.
[47:52] And here is John seeing this future
[47:55] home, the new city. And he showed me a
[47:59] pure river of water of life clear as
[48:04] crystal.
[48:05] proceeding out of the throne of God and
[48:08] of the Lamb.
[48:10] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[48:13] reading of the word as you're being
[48:14] seated.
[48:21] I want to speak on this thought here
[48:23] this morning. There is a river.
[48:31] You know, Brother Brandham when he
[48:34] would go to
[48:37] dedicate the tabernacle there in
[48:40] Jeffersonville
[48:41] in the message, God hiding and revealing
[48:44] himself in simplicity. And it was the
[48:48] dedication where they had added on to
[48:52] the tabernacle. And then they it was the
[48:56] preparation then and uh how everything
[48:58] had went to make that reconstruction.
[49:01] And so they came to rededicate that that
[49:05] temple.
[49:07] And you know, brother Brandham makes
[49:09] some statements within there that he
[49:13] looks back on that of how that God had
[49:17] led him to that place to build that
[49:21] tabernacle. As a matter of fact, he said
[49:22] of how that many of the people it was
[49:26] during the time of the depression and
[49:28] what a that in itself you could speak
[49:30] that's a paradox how that during the
[49:33] time of such a an economic downturn but
[49:36] yet a tabernacle was built. Brother
[49:40] Brandham even told us of the sacrifices
[49:42] that went into that where he said even
[49:45] there were mothers that allowanced their
[49:49] children at the table in order to be
[49:52] able to support that work. And so what
[49:56] you find is I would not say that that in
[49:59] itself is anything that's easy, but I
[50:02] think what we draw from there is where
[50:04] you find that there were hearts that God
[50:08] had placed a burden in their heart to
[50:11] have a place where God could come and
[50:14] visit with his people and where that
[50:18] they could come and to bring their
[50:20] families. God had called them out from
[50:23] many different walks of life and places
[50:25] where they had been and brother Brandham
[50:28] lays that remember he lays the
[50:30] cornerstone and when you uh hear how
[50:32] brother Brandham tells of it of how that
[50:35] that particular place was it's kind of
[50:37] hard to visualize it when you're
[50:39] standing there I've stood there each
[50:41] time mostly every time I go to
[50:43] Jeffersonville I always go into those
[50:45] areas for me a lot of times um when
[50:47] we're there I get out early of a morning
[50:49] and I go find somewhere to pray. I do
[50:52] that where I'm mostly anywhere I'm
[50:53] ministering. I get out early and I'll go
[50:55] pray somewhere, but there there's many
[50:58] places and like I told I told others
[51:00] there, I said, I don't care what you say
[51:02] about me. I said, but these these are
[51:04] special places to me. And so, I'll get
[51:07] out there and I'll go up to the mill
[51:08] where I can see that will where I don't
[51:10] know somewhere over there brother
[51:12] Brandham's cave is. And then I'll go and
[51:14] sometimes sit down right in front of
[51:16] Spring Street where the angel of the
[51:17] Lord came down and and just talk to the
[51:20] Lord and then we'll always as a family
[51:22] go by um where brother Brandham was
[51:25] buried and it's just you know you're
[51:27] thankful. Um I think of how that brother
[51:30] Ray was the one who showed me where
[51:32] Finny uh and then from there I've taken
[51:35] other brothers by there and you know you
[51:37] go by those places even where Finny out
[51:39] in um uh Oberlin and you know you'll
[51:42] pray and thank God for for men of God
[51:44] like that.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would do that. As a
[51:47] matter of fact, Brother Brandham even
[51:48] stood out stood in front of um Amy
[51:51] Simple McFersonson's tombstone and thank
[51:54] God for her life. So you know I look at
[51:58] this within here how the prophet would
[52:00] you can see that there were many things
[52:03] that was said regarding this tabernacle.
[52:06] Many said brother Bam will pick it up in
[52:08] a another message where many had said it
[52:10] would be turned into a garage in just a
[52:13] little bit of time. And you see when
[52:17] you're looking at it, you know, that's
[52:19] all men could see. Here you're taking
[52:21] I'm going to raise up a tabernacle in a
[52:23] place that is not fit to even build
[52:25] because it was a pond. It was a it was a
[52:27] place that what what what could come out
[52:29] of here? I mean, why would you choose
[52:31] this place? And yet then the prophet
[52:33] will go on to tell us of how that even
[52:36] when there was a fire that they were
[52:38] really unaware that but it was because
[52:40] of the way the stove and the pipe going
[52:42] up in there and when they were doing the
[52:44] uh renovations in the tabernacle there
[52:47] they were able to look into the rafters
[52:49] and um able to see how the the burn
[52:52] marks and brother Brandham you know how
[52:54] he says it on tape he says why it didn't
[52:57] burn down he said only God knows
[53:00] &gt;&gt; then he speaks about how the flood came
[53:03] and how that you know the the podium
[53:05] that they had there and that flood
[53:07] itself and where it came you know and
[53:10] then the podium it sat back down after
[53:13] the flood you know had had you know
[53:15] receded back to its banks and the Bible
[53:18] was still open to the same place
[53:21] &gt;&gt; to me when we look at little things and
[53:24] you can see and hear in brother
[53:25] Brandham's voice because not only does
[53:28] it it's it's means something when he can
[53:31] witness witness and others can witness
[53:34] that what God has put within the heart
[53:38] that no man can take that out.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; And what God has given in his word, God
[53:46] will watch over his word.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And there's many things that try to
[53:50] completely destroy that little
[53:53] tabernacle. And you know, I want to just
[53:55] say this to you. Don't just leave that
[53:58] as a brickandmortar building. But I want
[54:01] you to see that in your life and my life
[54:04] of how that the enemy would like nothing
[54:07] more and has made attempt after attempt
[54:10] to try to destroy a tabernacle of God.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; And remember, I didn't say thee, but I
[54:15] said a tabernacle of God because you are
[54:18] a tabernacle
[54:19] &gt;&gt; of the living God. Paul said that know
[54:22] you not your bodies are a temple of the
[54:26] Holy Ghost. And you know when we
[54:29] consider this and look at the tabernacle
[54:31] itself and how that when brother Bana
[54:35] would go through this dedication and he
[54:37] would speak of how that he said, you
[54:39] know, in reference to that of
[54:42] Revelations 21 where John saw that of
[54:45] the new city coming down and and he saw
[54:48] John saw all of the all the glorious
[54:50] attributes all that's being described
[54:53] and even of the temple and how that you
[54:55] know there is not of building that's
[54:58] made of of hands. But you know, it is
[55:01] that where it's described of the Lord
[55:03] God and the Lamb as the temple. And so,
[55:06] Brother Brandon will pick this up and
[55:07] he'll say it in this way. He said,
[55:09] "These little places like David, he had
[55:13] David could not build the true
[55:15] tabernacle of God because he wasn't
[55:17] prepared to do it. There was nothing he
[55:20] could do. He was mortal and had shed
[55:23] blood. And so it is today to us. We are
[55:26] not prepared to build the true
[55:29] tabernacle of God. There's only one can
[55:31] do that and it's being in construction
[55:34] now. He says, "But this little
[55:36] tabernacle." Now he brings the attention
[55:38] to the dwelling place there on 8th and
[55:40] Penn Street along with the temple that
[55:43] Solomon built and along with the others
[55:46] such as this right here are only
[55:49] temporary places of worship until the
[55:53] time comes when the real tabernacle will
[55:55] be set up on the earth
[55:57] &gt;&gt; and righteousness shall reign from sky
[55:59] to sky. There'll be no more sorrow. He
[56:01] refers to the scripture. There'll be no
[56:03] funerals preached in that tabernacle.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; There will be no more weddings for the
[56:09] wedding will be one great wedding for
[56:11] eternity. What a time
[56:13] &gt;&gt; that will be.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; But let us purpose in our heart today.
[56:16] He said that in commemoration and
[56:19] waiting for that tabernacle to come that
[56:22] we will so characterize ourself by his
[56:27] spirit that we will worship in this
[56:30] place as if we were in that other place
[56:34] waiting for that place to come.
[56:36] Hallelujah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; So that we will so characterize ourself
[56:42] by his spirit and that's what God has
[56:44] given what God promised and he's given
[56:47] is the Holy Spirit to lead the church of
[56:50] the living God. So I want to come into
[56:53] this into this thought on there is a
[56:57] river because here we are we are in uh
[57:00] what the prophet called a temporary
[57:02] place and I want you to also see very
[57:05] clearly that the that the body that you
[57:08] are dwelling in is also a temporary
[57:11] dwelling
[57:12] &gt;&gt; but in that temporary dwelling is to be
[57:14] a memorial of how God has brought you
[57:18] out what he's done in your life and it's
[57:21] also will witness that he's got he has a
[57:24] place prepared for you. Not just this
[57:26] city, but you have a body reserved in
[57:30] the heavens.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; One that's not made with hands, but here
[57:34] these are just temporary
[57:37] &gt;&gt; dwellings.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And so in these temporary dwellings, let
[57:41] us so characterize our lives even here
[57:44] in our lives and how we are here. Even
[57:48] not only in here but how we in in our
[57:51] life and in our walk. Let it be so
[57:52] characterized by his spirit. Notice not
[57:55] by our our uh efforts or our strivings
[58:00] but by his spirit as he will lead us and
[58:04] guide us and shape us and mold us to
[58:07] where our lives reflect that oncoming
[58:11] city. Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Because remember when John saw it, it is
[58:14] as a bride that is prepared
[58:17] &gt;&gt; and adorned for her husband. Let me just
[58:19] read just a few other scriptures because
[58:22] when we take from this here there is a
[58:26] river and I want you just to look at a
[58:28] few scriptures here within in in the
[58:31] Bible. many scriptures we could read
[58:33] from. But look, let's just fellowship
[58:35] around these around these principles.
[58:37] For it says, "Blessed is the man that
[58:39] walketh not in the counsel of the
[58:41] ungodly, nor standeth in the way of
[58:44] sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the
[58:47] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[58:51] of the Lord, and in his law does he
[58:53] meditate day and night. And he shall be
[58:56] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[59:00] water, singular, that bringeth forth his
[59:04] fruit in his season. His leaf also shall
[59:08] not wither, and whatsoever he doeth
[59:11] shall prosper. And so looking at this
[59:15] here, rivers of one water in Psalm
[59:20] 78:16,
[59:21] speaking of God's faithfulness there
[59:24] when they were in journey out of Egypt
[59:26] to the promised land, he brought streams
[59:29] also out of the rock and caused waters
[59:33] to run down like rivers.
[59:37] I want to remind you here this
[59:38] scripture, this rock, you and I would
[59:41] not choose a rock or think of a rock as
[59:45] a likely place to find water
[59:47] &gt;&gt; because a rock is the driest thing there
[59:50] would be.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; But yet God making himself known that he
[59:55] is the supply of all we have need of. He
[59:58] alone as David said is my rock.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He alone is my rock. And out of that
[1:00:04] rock, speaking of Christ himself, would
[1:00:07] come forth the waters that would be
[1:00:10] needed to sustain you and I in our
[1:00:12] earthly journey. How sweet and how
[1:00:15] precious is the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That God himself and that what
[1:00:20] would be looked upon to be maybe the
[1:00:22] most unlikely source, but it is the very
[1:00:24] source of our strength, the source of
[1:00:27] our life. And God has revealed himself.
[1:00:30] He has brought streams also out of that
[1:00:32] rock. Not just one little trickle, but
[1:00:34] there are streams out of that rock and
[1:00:37] cause waters to run down like rivers. In
[1:00:41] Isaiah 32, behold, a king shall reign in
[1:00:44] righteousness. Princes shall rule in
[1:00:46] judgment, and a man shall be as a hiding
[1:00:49] place from the wind, and a covert from
[1:00:51] the tempest, as rivers of water in a dry
[1:00:55] place, as the shadow of a great rock in
[1:00:59] a weary land. Notice rivers of water in
[1:01:02] a dry place. Jesus said in John 7:37,
[1:01:07] "In the last day, that great day of the
[1:01:09] feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if
[1:01:13] any man thirst, let him come unto me and
[1:01:16] drink, he that believeth on me, as the
[1:01:19] scripture hath said, out of his belly
[1:01:23] shall flow rivers of living water." All
[1:01:28] right. Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Isaiah 12 and verse two,
[1:01:33] behold, God is my salvation. I will
[1:01:36] trust and not be afraid. For the Lord
[1:01:40] Jehovah is my strength and my song. He
[1:01:43] also is become my salvation.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water
[1:01:51] out of the wells of salvation. In
[1:01:54] Jeremiah 2:13, for my people have
[1:01:57] committed two evils. They have forsaken
[1:01:59] me, the fountain of living waters, and
[1:02:02] hewed them outnists
[1:02:06] that can hold no water. Notice the
[1:02:08] fountain of living waters. In Zechariah
[1:02:12] 13:1, in that day there shall be a
[1:02:15] fountain opened to the house of David
[1:02:18] and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for
[1:02:20] sin and for uncleanliness. So over and
[1:02:24] over just within these little portions
[1:02:27] of scripture as as as was in our text,
[1:02:30] you find that there is one river with
[1:02:34] many streams. There is one fountain with
[1:02:38] with many streams or avenues that it
[1:02:41] flows. And I want to just say it as
[1:02:43] Jesus said in John 17 or John 7 where we
[1:02:47] read from that scripture there when he
[1:02:49] when he said in in the word if that
[1:02:51] great day of the feast that's the feast
[1:02:53] of tabernacles temporary dwelling places
[1:02:57] that if any man thirst let him come unto
[1:02:59] me and drink and he that believeth on me
[1:03:02] as the scripture has said out of his
[1:03:04] belly shall flow rivers of living water.
[1:03:10] So understanding that within all of this
[1:03:13] as we're looking at here that it is one
[1:03:17] river with many streams and when you
[1:03:20] bring that on down the prophet would
[1:03:22] bring it down in this manner and talk
[1:03:24] about even with Kadesh Barnea and how
[1:03:27] Kadesh Barnea being that place of many
[1:03:30] springs and brother Brandham types that
[1:03:32] has that there is one main water source
[1:03:35] and that is that water source that comes
[1:03:37] from the presence of God. But God has
[1:03:40] many local springs where they are fed
[1:03:44] from that water source. That that's why
[1:03:47] we we don't want any other water source.
[1:03:49] We just want the water source that comes
[1:03:51] from him.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Because the water source that comes from
[1:03:54] him is a living water.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; It's a flowing water. It is fit to take
[1:03:59] care of whatever the need might be. it
[1:04:02] it's able to direct us and to expose the
[1:04:06] enemy at all his attempted discrediting
[1:04:08] and trying to destroy and break
[1:04:10] confidence in God's word in the presence
[1:04:13] of this great fountain. Not only is sin
[1:04:16] and uncleanliness dismissed and lives
[1:04:18] are changed, but how Satan is brought
[1:04:21] from undercover. He's exposed and God
[1:04:24] brings forth a real liberty and there is
[1:04:27] a real joy that is to be present within
[1:04:32] the tabernacles of the Lord.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, I want to pull
[1:04:37] upon a quote that I used last week and
[1:04:41] um here I want to begin to read from
[1:04:43] this and draw a little bit more. And
[1:04:45] brother Bram says, "A communion with the
[1:04:48] Lord is like an oasis in a desert. It's
[1:04:52] like the spring underneath the pond.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; You see, it's got to have a a source
[1:05:00] that's providing it.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; You all have drove and been around
[1:05:04] places that do not have a feeding
[1:05:08] source, a supply source, and they have
[1:05:11] to continue to keep that going. They'll
[1:05:14] have um uh those water fountains, you
[1:05:16] know, it's bubbling up. that's trying to
[1:05:18] in their treatments and everything. But
[1:05:20] if it's got a living supply source, you
[1:05:24] don't have to worry about stagnation
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; because that living source sees to it
[1:05:30] that it's a moving water. And where
[1:05:32] there's moving water, wiggle tails can't
[1:05:35] exist. Where there's moving water, uh
[1:05:38] critters aren't welcome. They they can't
[1:05:40] survive there because the cleanliness
[1:05:43] WILL KILL IT.
[1:05:45] BACTERIA CANNOT survive where there is
[1:05:48] cleanliness. And and that's why that in
[1:05:51] all of those scriptures that I read, HE
[1:05:53] IS THAT FOUNTAIN that's open to us.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; He is that river. He is that source. He
[1:05:59] is our life. HE IS THE FOUNTAIN of
[1:06:02] living water.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is what is supplying.
[1:06:08] IT'S NOT US SUPPLYING. HE IS our supply.
[1:06:11] Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; So it's like the spring underneath the
[1:06:14] pond where the traveler comes by, stops,
[1:06:17] drinks the water till he quenches his
[1:06:19] thirst. That's remembering the Lord,
[1:06:21] coming by the order of his table where
[1:06:24] the passing pilgrim that's sojouring
[1:06:26] here on earth with us together. that we
[1:06:28] can come by his table and there drink of
[1:06:32] his blessings and of his grace and of
[1:06:35] his word in fellowship around his word
[1:06:38] until our thirsty souls are satisfied.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Bam is only bringing
[1:06:44] the type when we take communion here of
[1:06:47] what it is to come to the house of God
[1:06:50] that here we gather together and drink
[1:06:53] of his blessings, of his grace, of his
[1:06:56] word in fellowship AROUND HIS WORD. LET
[1:06:59] ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT IS NOT
[1:07:01] ABOUT WHO IS WORTHY and who is unworthy.
[1:07:04] AS YOU DRINK ON THE WORD AND FROM THE
[1:07:07] FOUNTAIN, IT IS THE FOUNTAIN THAT HAS
[1:07:09] MADE YOU WORTHY. AND AS YOU TAKE OF THE
[1:07:13] FOUNTAIN, IT WILL CONTINUE [screaming]
[1:07:14] TO MAKE YOU WORTHY. AND THIS FOUNTAIN
[1:07:17] WILL TAKE AWAY SIN AND UNBELIEF FROM
[1:07:21] YOUR LIFE. THAT'S [screaming] THE POWER
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; OF THIS FOUNTAIN. [applause]
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Can I just share SOMETHING WITH YOU?
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RANDOM TALKS ABOUT HOW HE SAW A
[1:07:32] MAN. He said there was, he said, here he
[1:07:34] was. He said, "I knew this man real
[1:07:36] well." And he said, "But you know, he
[1:07:37] had a problem with smoking cigarettes."
[1:07:39] And he said, 'I WENT DOWN TO TALK TO HIM
[1:07:40] ABOUT, YOU KNOW, GIVING HIS LIFE TO THE
[1:07:43] LORD. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE BROTHER BRAM had
[1:07:44] a relationship with him. And he said,
[1:07:46] 'Well, brother Brandham, and you know,
[1:07:47] God was dealing with the man's life. HE
[1:07:49] SAID, "BUT BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE I GOT
[1:07:51] THESE CIGARETTES." BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:07:52] SAID, "QUIT LOOKING at them cigarettes."
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; And he SAID, "BROTHER BRANDON, DO YOU
[1:07:58] REALLY mean that IF I IF I'LL JUST
[1:08:00] ACCEPT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, YOU MEAN
[1:08:03] THAT THAT GOD GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF IT?"
[1:08:06] HE SAID, "YES." HE SAID, "BUT BROTHER
[1:08:07] BHAM, THESE CIGARETTES." AND BROTHER BAM
[1:08:09] SAYS, "THERE YOU GO AGAIN WITH THEM
[1:08:11] CIGARETTES."
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; NOW, let me TELL YOU, YOU CAN PUT
[1:08:15] WHATEVER IT is in your life. I DON'T
[1:08:18] CARE IF YOU'RE COMING TO THE PROMISED
[1:08:20] LAND OR YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE PROMISED
[1:08:22] LAND. The the the the the CURE TO IT ALL
[1:08:26] IS THE SAME. HE THE PROPHET SPOKE TO HIM
[1:08:28] AND SAID, "IF YOU'LL JUST COME AND TAKE
[1:08:31] OF THIS FOUNTAIN, IT WILL TAKE CARE OF
[1:08:34] THAT IN YOUR LIFE." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:08:36] BAPTIZED HIM IN THE NAME OF the Lord
[1:08:39] Jesus Christ.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; STILL SMOKING AND EVERYTHING. BROTHER
[1:08:43] BRANDHAM SAID, "I KNOW." HE SAID, "I GOT
[1:08:44] A LOT OF THE FAMILY THAT WAS A LITTLE
[1:08:46] BIT upset with me. Thought I was doing
[1:08:47] wrong." But brother said, "I knew what I
[1:08:50] WAS DOING. WHAT WAS IT?" YOU KNOW, YOU
[1:08:52] IF YOU GET IT BACKWARDS IF YOU TRY TO
[1:08:53] CLEAN YOURSELF UP FIRST. YOU CAN'T CLEAN
[1:08:56] YOURSELF UP OUTSIDE OF THIS FOUNTAIN.
[1:08:59] THIS FOUNTAIN WAS OPEN FOR YOU. AS A
[1:09:02] MATTER OF FACT, [screaming] THIS
[1:09:03] FOUNTAIN CAME DOWN FOR YOU.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD CLEANSE
[1:09:08] SIN. OH, THE THE BLOOD COULD, YOU KNOW,
[1:09:11] THAT GOD GAVE THROUGH SHADOWS AND TYPES.
[1:09:13] IT COULD COVER, BUT HE CAN NEVER REALLY
[1:09:15] DEAL WITH THE UNBELIEF. BUT THIS
[1:09:17] FOUNTAIN,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE VERY PERSON OF LIFE HIMSELF
[1:09:23] CAME [screaming] DOWN AND BECOME ONE OF
[1:09:25] US. HE WENT THROUGH LIFE. HE EXPERIENCED
[1:09:29] IT AS A TEENAGER. HE EXPERIENCED EVERY
[1:09:31] PART OF LIFE SO THAT HE MIGHT BE A
[1:09:34] FAITHFUL AND MERCIFUL HIGH PRIEST
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; for you and for me.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And he became the fountain open
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; for you and I.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Drink until our thirsty souls are
[1:09:54] satisfied. And then when we leave the
[1:09:57] place of worship, refreshed,
[1:10:00] satisfied,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; going out to meet the desert's problems
[1:10:04] again, the problems of life's desert,
[1:10:07] that's life
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; is a desert,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; there's a lot of dry places. You see,
[1:10:13] when when as God begins to deal and move
[1:10:16] within a person's heart, things change
[1:10:18] within their lives. Just as we were
[1:10:20] working with the young people there on
[1:10:22] Friday night, associations begin to
[1:10:24] change in your life because there is a
[1:10:26] call that has come upon your life from
[1:10:29] God and their faith is building in your
[1:10:32] life. And it's not something that you're
[1:10:33] quitting. THERE'S THINGS. IT'S HIM AND
[1:10:36] THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM THAT'S even
[1:10:39] affecting your choices in life.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; WHO'S DOING THAT? HE IS. YES.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL WOULD LIKE YOU TO MAKE MAKE
[1:10:48] YOU THINK IT'S YOU THAT'S STOPPING IT.
[1:10:51] [applause]
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT YOU. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE
[1:10:54] DECISION YOU'RE MAKING IS NOT
[1:10:56] [screaming] IS ABOUT WHAT GOD is moving
[1:10:59] AND DOING IN YOUR LIFE. SO WHEN WE WE
[1:11:01] COME TO THIS PLACE HOW GOD IS EVEN
[1:11:04] drawing upon our lives AND DRAWING UPON
[1:11:07] OUR HEARTS, YOU COME TO A PLACE THAT I
[1:11:09] YOU KNOW EVEN AS GOD IS DEALING WITH THE
[1:11:10] LIFE, HE BEGINS TO REMOVE ANY
[1:11:12] SATISFACTION THAT YOU FIND OUT THERE.
[1:11:15] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT'S
[1:11:16] REMOVING THAT IS THE FOUNTAIN.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT REMOVED IT FROM THAT MAN
[1:11:21] WHO WAS SMOKING CIGARETTES? THE
[1:11:23] FOUNTAIN.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; HE JUST KEPT DRINKING FROM THE FOUNTAIN.
[1:11:26] LET ME TELL YOU, THE FOUNTAIN WILL TAKE
[1:11:28] CARE OF IT. AMEN.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU YOU HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE
[1:11:33] PROBLEMS IF THERE'S ANYTHING ANY PLACE
[1:11:35] AND WE HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.
[1:11:37] BUT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE FOUNTAIN.
[1:11:40] [cheering]
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL HANGING OVER YOUR
[1:11:43] HEAD OR WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS. LISTEN, WE
[1:11:45] ARE STILL MORTALS, BUT [screaming] WE
[1:11:47] HAVE ACCESS TO THE FOUNTAIN.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] IF NOT FOR
[1:11:53] GRACE, WHERE WOULD I be?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND TO COME BECAUSE OUT
[1:11:59] THERE IT'S DESERT. YOU START FINDING
[1:12:01] WHAT MAYBE AT TIMES WAS YOUR REFRESHMENT
[1:12:03] AND YOUR JOY AND WHAT YEAR WAS YOUR
[1:12:06] GO-TO for when you got down and and go
[1:12:08] to here and go to this and and maybe AND
[1:12:11] AND THEN THINGS CHANGE AND WHAT'S
[1:12:13] HAPPENING? THOSE THINGS NO LONGER HOLD
[1:12:16] THAT SATISFACTION AND THAT JOY AND THAT
[1:12:19] REFRESHING TO [screaming] YOUR LIFE. AND
[1:12:21] GOD WILL EVEN ALLOW YOU TO TEST THOSE
[1:12:23] WATERS. AND WHAT YOU FIND THOSE ARE
[1:12:26] [screaming] NOT ANY ANY OASIS. Those are
[1:12:29] mirages.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD BEGINS TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN
[1:12:35] THAT I AM YOUR ALL SUFFICIENCY.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I am your oasis.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And he gives us the strength we need
[1:12:44] here to face life's desert [snorts]
[1:12:47] problems.
[1:12:49] So he is
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; our oasis.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture that we read from our
[1:12:57] text, it said there is a river
[1:13:02] where the streams whereof
[1:13:05] shall make glad the city of God, the
[1:13:09] holy place of the tabernacles of the
[1:13:13] most high. God is in the midst of her.
[1:13:16] She shall not be moved. God shall help
[1:13:19] her. And that right early I I didn't
[1:13:22] forget a slide. I just don't I'm not
[1:13:23] going to put no more up after this. I
[1:13:25] just want to go.
[1:13:27] There is a river
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; where the streams thereof do what? Make
[1:13:32] the city make glad the city of God. Now
[1:13:36] this glad it's coming from a true
[1:13:38] resource. So it ma it brings true
[1:13:43] gladness.
[1:13:44] Now remember I want you to think about
[1:13:46] this. You know, you could find this in
[1:13:48] the scripture and many times, you know,
[1:13:50] we quote it and we quote it in different
[1:13:52] in different ways, but you know, the
[1:13:54] Bible tells us that that happy is that
[1:13:57] people whose God is the Lord,
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham would go over
[1:14:02] and and and and work through many places
[1:14:04] and speak of how that God intended and
[1:14:08] wants us to be happy. And he says,"I
[1:14:10] believe he wants us to be happy. And I
[1:14:12] believe we could also, he said, run it
[1:14:15] to extremes and just get insincere about
[1:14:18] it. But I believe that God wants his
[1:14:20] people to be real happy and sociable,
[1:14:23] friendly from our hearts, loving each
[1:14:25] other as God for Christ's sake or Christ
[1:14:28] loved us." I THINK THAT'S WHY we ought
[1:14:32] to be happy Christians
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; IS BECAUSE WHY? NOT it really it don't
[1:14:38] have anything to do with everything of
[1:14:41] life that's going on around us because
[1:14:43] let me just say it to you like this
[1:14:44] there are seasons Peter describes that
[1:14:48] we are in heaviness
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; right BUT BEFORE HE STARTS THAT
[1:14:53] SCRIPTURE THERE'S THREE words that he
[1:14:55] says before that scripture he says and
[1:14:58] he's referring to that lively hope we've
[1:15:01] been begotten unto a great expectation
[1:15:04] there is a body reserved in the heavens
[1:15:06] And our faith IS IN GOD. BY him who hath
[1:15:10] raised from the dead. HE'S RAISED US UP.
[1:15:12] BY HIM DO WE REJOICE GREATLY. BUT IF
[1:15:15] NEED be
[1:15:17] are in heaviness
[1:15:20] for a season.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Now the heaviness for the season, the
[1:15:25] pressure it comes around. that weighs
[1:15:27] upon, you know, uh, whether the body or
[1:15:30] the spirit because anytime there's
[1:15:33] things that are going on within a trial,
[1:15:35] I I want to just say this to you that
[1:15:37] the joy of the Lord that has been
[1:15:40] deposited in our soul, THE WORLD DIDN'T
[1:15:42] give it and the world can't take it
[1:15:44] away.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Uh, the NASDAQ didn't give it and the
[1:15:47] NASDAQ can't take it away. Are you WITH
[1:15:50] ME? THE JOB DIDN'T GIVE IT AND THE JOB
[1:15:51] CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY. THIS IS A JOY
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; AND THAT JOY HAS BEEN DEPOSITED IN THIS
[1:15:59] temporary dwelling place.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN NEHEMIAH SPOKE TO THEM AND
[1:16:06] THEY THE THE THE BOOK became open and
[1:16:08] they were standing the Bible says on the
[1:16:10] pullpit and he be to read AND AND AND
[1:16:13] CAUSE understanding to come to the
[1:16:16] people. THE PEOPLE BE TO HEAR what was
[1:16:18] being read and they begin to weep. AND
[1:16:20] THERE WAS A PART OF THAT THAT WAS
[1:16:22] EXACTLY SO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DESERVING
[1:16:25] OF THE grace that has come to us. BUT TO
[1:16:28] BE FOCUSED ON THE VOICE THAT THEN STEPS
[1:16:31] FORWARD and says, "WAIT A MINUTE. THIS
[1:16:34] IS NOT THE RIGHT SEASON. You're in a
[1:16:36] season you you are weeping but you've
[1:16:38] got the wrong reaction or you've got the
[1:16:41] right reaction but in the wrong season."
[1:16:44] AND HE LET THEM KNOW YOU THIS IS IN this
[1:16:46] is in the SEASON OF THE FEAST OF
[1:16:49] TABERNACLES.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S A TIME OF MEMORIAL. IT'S A TIME AND
[1:16:53] THIS IS WHERE THE SCRIPTURE THAT WE TALK
[1:16:55] ABOUT QUITE OFTEN. THE JOY OF THE LORD
[1:16:57] IS MY STRENGTH. THAT'S WHERE THAT
[1:16:59] SCRIPTURE COMES FROM. BECAUSE THE RIGHT
[1:17:02] RESPONSE IN THAT FEAST WAS TO BE JOYFUL,
[1:17:06] WAS [screaming] TO WORSHIP, WAS TO GIVE
[1:17:08] HONOR TO GOD FROM WHERE HE HAS BROUGHT
[1:17:10] YOU FROM. SURE, WE [screaming] DON'T
[1:17:11] DESERVE IT. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S HIS GRACE
[1:17:14] THAT HAS GIVEN IT TO US. BUT WE ARE TO
[1:17:16] REJOICE. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A MESSAGE
[1:17:18] OF CONDEMNATION.
[1:17:21] [cheering]
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE WAS SENT TO LIBERATE SONS
[1:17:25] AND [screaming] DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:17:27] THIS MESSAGE WAS SENT TO DRIVE BACK THE
[1:17:30] DARKNESS. [cheering]
[1:17:32] THIS MESSAGE WAS SENT TO LOOSEN
[1:17:34] PRISONERS.
[1:17:37] AS A MATTER OF FACT, AS IT SAYS IN
[1:17:38] ISAIAH, HE SHALL SAY UNTO UNTO HIS
[1:17:42] PRISONERS, "BE FREE."
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD THAT IS BRINGING A
[1:17:47] LOOSENING.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; One of these moments, it'll be the final
[1:17:53] loosening.
[1:17:55] [sighs]
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; That's why we ought to be happy
[1:18:00] Christians.
[1:18:04] And yet we find that when you look at an
[1:18:07] oasis like this
[1:18:10] and water supply,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; A river.
[1:18:15] I have videos that have come in even now
[1:18:18] from brother Keith Reed and others from
[1:18:20] there in Jamaica, other brothers and
[1:18:22] their churches, their buildings,
[1:18:24] [clears throat] some of the homes are
[1:18:25] completely gone and so forth. I mean,
[1:18:27] you you've seen no doubt the
[1:18:28] devastation, but the point is is that
[1:18:32] you can find a source of source of water
[1:18:35] and a supply like this in my out in the
[1:18:37] middle of a desert. Man, that's a
[1:18:40] refreshing place. All you can think
[1:18:41] about, if I could just get there, if I
[1:18:44] can just get there, I'll be refreshed,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Same way with that of the river is
[1:18:50] looking at that. If I can just get to
[1:18:52] that river, you begin to hear the sounds
[1:18:55] of that river. But you know the one
[1:18:57] thing that is so uh very crucial within
[1:19:01] it is that you know uh I for I think a
[1:19:05] brother a brother was sharing this when
[1:19:07] we
[1:19:09] were there together at the the men's
[1:19:10] meeting and I had no idea none of this
[1:19:12] was before me at that time whatsoever
[1:19:15] and really this all didn't drop until
[1:19:17] early Monday morning but the brother was
[1:19:21] talking about how that on one of their
[1:19:23] pieces of property he was out with the
[1:19:25] brother on his piece the property and
[1:19:26] they had a they had a spring that was
[1:19:29] fed from it was it was fed or or a a
[1:19:33] source of water, a pond that was
[1:19:35] actually fed by a real source. But what
[1:19:38] had happened is there had been a lot of
[1:19:40] things that had started to just build
[1:19:42] up. You know, it starts to old tires,
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; 2x4s,
[1:19:48] things just start building up and
[1:19:50] building up and building up until
[1:19:52] eventually you look at that source as he
[1:19:55] described it. Nobody would want to drink
[1:19:58] from it. Yet, IT IT IT HAS WITHIN IT
[1:20:01] THAT SUPPLY SOURCE to where it's ABLE TO
[1:20:04] CLEAR OUT ALL THOSE THINGS. YOU SEE,
[1:20:05] WHAT WAS ALLOWING EVEN things to build
[1:20:07] up was because the things that was PUT
[1:20:09] IN IT. NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE WATER
[1:20:12] SUPPLY.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; THE WATER SUPPLY WAS STILL PUTTING OUT
[1:20:15] WATER, BUT IT'S WHAT HAD BE TO
[1:20:17] ACCUMULATE. WE COULD CALL IT DEBRIS
[1:20:20] BUILDUP over time. WHAT BECAME JUST, YOU
[1:20:22] KNOW, JUST A, YOU KNOW, A LAWNMOWER
[1:20:24] TIRE. WELL, eventually led to tractor
[1:20:26] tires, eventually led to, you know, to
[1:20:28] wood beams, eventually led TO OTHER
[1:20:29] THINGS TO WHERE LOOKING UPON IT, IT'S
[1:20:32] NOT APPEALING. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT IT
[1:20:34] THAT YOU WANT TO DRINK FROM BECAUSE WHAT
[1:20:37] YOU'RE SEEING AROUND THERE, BUT IT HAD
[1:20:39] NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SOURCE THAT WAS
[1:20:42] ACTUALLY BENEATH.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE BRETHREN HAD to
[1:20:45] do? The brother talked about it. He said
[1:20:47] WHAT THEY DID? THEY GOT TOGETHER, you
[1:20:48] know, A TRACTOR AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
[1:20:49] THEY GOT ALL OF THE [screaming] STUFF
[1:20:51] THAT WAS IN THERE AND PULLED IT OUT.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; G. AND WITHIN JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF
[1:20:58] TIME,
[1:21:00] A COUPLE HOURS, THEY COULD TAKE THEIR A
[1:21:03] CUP AND GO DOWN IN THERE AND DRINK THAT
[1:21:05] WATER. WHY? BECAUSE THE SOURCE WAS STILL
[1:21:09] [screaming] GOOD.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; THEY JUST HAD TO GET THE THINGS OUT OF
[1:21:12] IT. AMEN.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU AND I HERE
[1:21:19] THIS MORNING THAT THERE IS A RIVER
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE STREAMS THEREOF MAKE GLAD THE
[1:21:24] CITY of God. BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE
[1:21:28] ALWAYS WE THERE HAS TO BE A MAINTAINING
[1:21:31] OF THAT OASIS. YOU GOT TO WATCH OVER
[1:21:33] WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE'RE
[1:21:34] TALKING ABOUT THE STREAMS AND SO FORTH.
[1:21:36] ANYBODY THAT HAS PROPERTY WITH A STREAM
[1:21:39] GOING THROUGH IT OR WHATEVER, you know,
[1:21:40] I've I love water. To me, I love hearing
[1:21:43] water. There's nothing to me. There's
[1:21:44] not I like pictures of water. I like to
[1:21:47] relax listening water. But, you know, I
[1:21:49] ALSO KNOW THAT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
[1:21:51] LIKE THAT, EVEN UPON YOUR PROPERTY, you
[1:21:53] are obligated to maintain that.
[1:21:57] EVEN IF IT JUST FLOWS AND YOUR PROPERTY
[1:21:59] IS no more than this building and it
[1:22:01] flows from THIS CORNER TO THAT CORNER,
[1:22:03] you are responsible for that flow.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT FLOW OF WATER IS NOT
[1:22:10] SOMETHING that is licensed or owned by
[1:22:13] you.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; It's on that land, but you've got to
[1:22:17] maintain it.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO JUST SAY THIS RIGHT HERE.
[1:22:20] WE DON'T OWN THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; NO MAN HAS A COPYRIGHT ON THE HOLY
[1:22:25] GHOST. AMEN. THAT IS GOD. AND IT'S NOT
[1:22:28] UP TO ANY MAN TO DETERMINE WHO RECEIVES
[1:22:31] THE HOLY GHOST. IT IS GOD HIMSELF WHO IS
[1:22:34] THE FOUNTAIN, THE HOLY SPIRIT HIMSELF
[1:22:36] THAT gives of his own life.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And I want to say that we look at it in
[1:22:43] many times that the source of supply,
[1:22:46] it's still operating, still good, but at
[1:22:49] times it becomes unappealable and
[1:22:51] undrinkable. Not the Lord,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; but sometimes the place where it's
[1:22:56] supposed to be refreshing
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; place we're supposed to come to the
[1:22:59] house of God.
[1:23:01] If we're not careful, it can lose its
[1:23:03] appeal.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO RESTORE that
[1:23:08] cleaning out the debris?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; All right. SO, NOT JUST PUSH the debris
[1:23:14] on in it. No, IT'S GOT TO BE IT'S GOT TO
[1:23:16] BE PULLED OUT OF THERE. IT'S GOT TO BE
[1:23:17] CLEANED OUT THERE THERE BECAUSE THERE IS
[1:23:19] A POWER of restoration to bring
[1:23:23] refreshments
[1:23:24] from wounds,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; weariness and misunderstandings.
[1:23:31] Because when brother Brandham, remember
[1:23:33] these three words THAT I POINTED OUT
[1:23:35] LAST WEEK, THESE ARE THE three words
[1:23:37] that the prophet took when he spoke OF
[1:23:39] THIS OASIS BOTH TIMES THAT HE preached
[1:23:41] remembering the Lord and he spoke about
[1:23:44] coming together to worship that what it
[1:23:46] meant for the oasis TO BE PRESENT AND
[1:23:50] HOW THAT WITHIN THAT OASIS THAT SPRING
[1:23:52] COMING UP WAS A SPRING TO MINISTER to
[1:23:55] the wounded.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:59] and the wounded as we looked at that
[1:24:01] that wounds itself my wounds can be deep
[1:24:04] and Jesus said I've been wounded in the
[1:24:07] house of my friends
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; but I want you to notice this right here
[1:24:11] Jesus himself remember he's going to be
[1:24:13] what we read the fountain open in the
[1:24:16] house of David
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; to them to the house of David in
[1:24:19] Jerusalem he's the very one is saying
[1:24:21] WHEN THEY'LL ASK HIM WHERE DID YOU GET
[1:24:23] THOSE WOUNDS IN THE HOUSE OF MY FRIENDS
[1:24:25] BUT NOTICE WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED and What
[1:24:28] has TAKEN PLACE IS THERE is a healing
[1:24:31] and a healing that will come to Israel.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, there's nobody
[1:24:36] that can heal wounds like Jesus.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; NOBODY CAN HEAL WOUNDS LIKE JESUS. And
[1:24:41] and YOU KNOW WHAT? WOUNDS ARE ALL
[1:24:44] AROUND. BUT THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO
[1:24:45] SAY, GOD, I'VE NOT COME TO FELLOWSHIP
[1:24:48] ABOUT MY WOUNDS. NEITHER HAVE I COME TO
[1:24:50] IGNORE THEM. BUT I'VE COME TO SUBMIT IN
[1:24:53] THE HOUSE OF GOD THAT THE WOUND MIGHT BE
[1:24:56] CLEARED OUT.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; THE WOUND MIGHT BE CLEARED OUT AND THAT
[1:25:00] HE MIGHT MINISTER TO THE WOUNDS IN OUR
[1:25:03] LIFE AND BRING REFRESHMENT in our lives.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Misunderstanding. That's
[1:25:08] another one the prophet said that would
[1:25:10] would be present, you know,
[1:25:12] misunderstandings that were there. And
[1:25:14] he brought up Hagar and everything. How
[1:25:17] there's weariness for the weary
[1:25:18] traveler. And as I said, there's many
[1:25:20] times we get weary. We get weary as like
[1:25:23] the Bible said in welloing,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:29] And I forget one time that you know the
[1:25:31] doctors they uh I was just I think 13 or
[1:25:34] 14 years old. It comes to my mind and
[1:25:38] when my parents they took me there and
[1:25:40] there's an old country doctor down there
[1:25:41] in Rockford and they took took me in
[1:25:44] there and I just couldn't figure out
[1:25:45] because it seemed like that well I mean
[1:25:48] really can't pinpoint exactly what's
[1:25:50] what what's going on and it just was a
[1:25:52] sickness but they really couldn't
[1:25:54] pinpoint it you know and you said well
[1:25:55] brother Sammy that was the enemy. That's
[1:25:56] true. But let me let me also deal let me
[1:25:58] deal with something here that that the
[1:26:00] man he he pointed out doc the doctor did
[1:26:02] and he told my parents he pulled him
[1:26:03] aside. He said what it is he said it's
[1:26:05] the stress of just daytoday
[1:26:09] life
[1:26:11] of keeping you know and every one of us
[1:26:13] are made different but it's the routines
[1:26:14] and you know getting this done for
[1:26:16] school and this has to be done and this
[1:26:18] it was just the the buildup of the
[1:26:19] stress of life. Now as far as I know I
[1:26:22] never experienced that anymore. I can't
[1:26:24] say I hadn't experienced rest,
[1:26:25] [laughter] but I will say it like this
[1:26:27] and never left me because I thought, my
[1:26:29] goodness, what a what a thing to say,
[1:26:30] you know, because you're thinking, YOU
[1:26:32] KNOW, HOW do I GET HOW DO I get free of
[1:26:33] this or how do I get rid of this? And
[1:26:35] and you know, the doctors are wanting to
[1:26:36] to help out. And I want to say it like
[1:26:38] this that they're we we CAN BECOME
[1:26:40] WEARY, NOT JUST FROM TRIALS, NOT JUST
[1:26:43] FROM SICKNESS, BUT SOMETIMES JUST WEARY
[1:26:46] WITH DOING THE things of life. SURE.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S A WEARINESS OF BATTLING
[1:26:52] AND FIGHTING AND WAGING. SOMETIMES, YOU
[1:26:55] KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN GET WEARY even in
[1:26:58] what you're PRAYING ABOUT.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JESUS SAID, "I WOULD MAN PRAY
[1:27:03] AND THINK NOT."
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORST THING THE ENEMY CAN DO
[1:27:07] IS TRY TO DISCOURAGE YOU AS THOUGH
[1:27:10] [screaming] YOUR PRAYERS ARE NOT HAVING
[1:27:12] any effect.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO REMEMBER HOW SATAN IS. HE
[1:27:16] CANNOT HE CANNOT INTERPRET THE WORD BUT
[1:27:19] HE ALWAYS WANTS TO TRY TO DISCREDIT OR
[1:27:22] BRING DISCOURAGEMENT.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T BE FAINT. CONTINUE PRAYING.
[1:27:28] CONTINUE LOOKING TO GOD. BE LIKE THAT OF
[1:27:30] THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT WIDOW WOMAN
[1:27:33] THAT KEPT ON KNOCKING AND AND KEPT ON
[1:27:35] LOOKING THERE and that judge rose and
[1:27:37] gave to her what it is that she was
[1:27:40] asking for. You see, WHEN WE THINK OF
[1:27:43] THIS CLEANING OUT debris and and SO
[1:27:45] FORTH, BROTHER RAM T TALK TALKED TO US
[1:27:47] IN A MESSAGE FUNDAMENTAL foundation of
[1:27:49] faith and he'll go through that whole
[1:27:51] message and and pointing US THAT THE THE
[1:27:54] POWERS OF GOD ARE STILL UNLIMITED. THEY
[1:27:57] ARE STILL the same. And he said many
[1:28:00] times we become too clogged up and we
[1:28:02] can't understand and we thank God or we
[1:28:05] think the doctor said I CAN'T GET WELL.
[1:28:07] AS LONG AS YOU THINK THAT, YOU'RE NOT
[1:28:10] thinking God's thoughts.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, I'M GOING TO DIE. THE
[1:28:14] DOCTOR SAID I WAS GOING TO DIE." ALL
[1:28:16] REGARDS TO THE DOCTOR. THAT'S THE BEST
[1:28:18] of his knowledge. If he said you WAS
[1:28:20] GOING TO DIE, [screaming] HUMANLY
[1:28:22] SPEAKING, I WOULD believe the SAME
[1:28:24] THING. BUT BY THE WORD, I DON'T BELIEVE
[1:28:27] IT. That's right. BECAUSE HE PROMISED ME
[1:28:30] THAT WHATSOEVER I ASK THE father in his
[1:28:32] name would be granted. And I believe
[1:28:34] that's true. Now, you understand WHAT'S
[1:28:36] HAPPENING HERE? HUMANLY SPEAKING,
[1:28:38] ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE DOCTOR CAN
[1:28:40] SEE, I COULD AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE
[1:28:43] WORD SAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; SEE, that's where we've got to be ABLE
[1:28:47] TO STAND AS THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
[1:28:49] [screaming] HUMANLY SPEAKING, I CAN SEE
[1:28:51] THIS. I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS. BUT THE
[1:28:54] WORD SAYS THIS.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU BRING THE WORD TO ANY
[1:28:59] SITUATION, THAT'S WHERE DEBRIS STARTS TO
[1:29:02] BE CLEANED OUT. THE WORD STARTS TO POINT
[1:29:04] OUT, REMOVE THAT. REMOVE THAT. GET THAT
[1:29:07] OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE THE WORD IS ALL
[1:29:09] POWERFUL.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WHEN ELI WHEN DEESA WAS ALL
[1:29:13] SHAKEN UP, OH, WE'RE SURROUNDED. OH. OH,
[1:29:16] we're surrounded. THEY'RE ALL AROUND US.
[1:29:18] HE WAS RIGHT [screaming] HUMANLY
[1:29:19] SPEAKING.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; BUT ELISHA SAID, GOD,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; OPEN HIS EYES
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; THAT HE CAN SEE THERE'S MORE WITH US
[1:29:29] THAN THERE IS AGAINST US.
[1:29:31] AND THE PROPHET OPENS UNVEILING OF GOD
[1:29:34] WITH THAT AND SAYS, "SEE, THE
[1:29:36] [screaming] GOD THAT ALWAYS WAS HAS
[1:29:38] ALWAYS BEEN HERE. HE'S JUST CHANGED THE
[1:29:42] SEEING OF HIS SERVANT."
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IS, "OH GOD,
[1:29:47] [screaming] LET ME SEE IT IN THE RIGHT
[1:29:49] WAY."
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF ALL I CAN DO IS LOOK AT
[1:29:53] EVERYTHING THAT'S AROUND ME, MY THAT'S
[1:29:55] TROUBLING. BUT GOD, [screaming] OPEN MY
[1:29:57] SEEING
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; THAT I CAN see you. Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then we can get that channel the
[1:30:07] prophet said cleared out. Then the
[1:30:08] energy it begins to run. It begins to
[1:30:10] move. It begins to flow. And that's why
[1:30:12] he said just as sure. He said as it
[1:30:15] takes every member of my body to operate
[1:30:17] and give me life. It takes every member
[1:30:20] uh of the body of Christ to operate to
[1:30:23] give it life.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Now let me just run over a few things
[1:30:26] here. Just very briefly. And I'm going
[1:30:28] to cover a couple a couple things here
[1:30:30] this morning. Here we find when you go
[1:30:33] through the letters in the New Testament
[1:30:37] truly the fountain of God has been
[1:30:39] opened, the river of God and the streams
[1:30:42] thereof that make the city of God glad.
[1:30:44] And God has been building his body down
[1:30:47] through time. We remember God made a
[1:30:50] promise that I will restore. And so
[1:30:52] there's only one thing that can actually
[1:30:54] really make glad the city of God and
[1:30:57] that's the spirit of God moving down and
[1:31:00] to really deal with our lives. Now I'm
[1:31:02] just going to say it like this. The
[1:31:04] making glad of our lives. I I've had
[1:31:06] times where oh my just a shouting and a
[1:31:09] jumping and and things like that. I've
[1:31:11] had I've had those KIND OF MOMENTS. BUT
[1:31:13] I'VE ALSO HAD THE KIND OF MOMENTS AND
[1:31:15] AND for me the moments that I so even
[1:31:17] appreciate. I I love THEM ALL. BUT I
[1:31:19] APPRECIATE HOW THE WORD GETS DOWN AND
[1:31:22] SOMETIMES IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A JUMP IN
[1:31:24] time and there may not be a shouting
[1:31:25] TIME AND AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING THE WAY
[1:31:27] THE WORD GETS DOWN AND IT'S JUST LIKE
[1:31:30] THE WORD IT'S JUST LIKE A PERSONAL
[1:31:32] INTERVIEW AND IT'S JUST TAKING IT'S
[1:31:35] TAKING COVERS OFF. IT'S JUST IT'S TAKING
[1:31:38] DISPUTES AND ARGUMENTS THAT THE ENEMY
[1:31:41] HAS PLACED THERE AND GOD'S JUST TAKING
[1:31:43] THEM ONE BY ONE AND JUST TABLEABLING
[1:31:46] EVERY ARGUMENT. SO IN OTHER WORDS, YOU
[1:31:48] SEE, GOD JUST DOESN'T WANT TO JUST WIPE
[1:31:50] IT AWAY. HE WANTS TO DISMANTLE SATAN'S
[1:31:54] HOLD. SO WHATEVER HAS A HOLD WILL NEVER
[1:31:59] BE ABLE TO HAVE A HOLD ON YOU AGAIN
[1:32:02] BECAUSE YOU WILL SEE SATAN'S ACCUSATIONS
[1:32:05] AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORD IN YOU IS
[1:32:09] GREATER THAN ANY ACCUSATION. AND YOU'RE
[1:32:11] ABLE TO STAND THERE ON THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:32:14] GOD takes and dismantles Satan's
[1:32:19] arguments.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Remember what Satan's trying to do is
[1:32:24] put debris is load things up cuz he
[1:32:27] can't stop the water supply.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; SO HERE PAUL comes in and in the
[1:32:33] Corinthian church he finds among the
[1:32:36] Corinthian church where there are
[1:32:40] disputes and divisions AND HE COMES
[1:32:43] AMONG THEM. AND I WANT YOU TO THINK
[1:32:44] ABOUT THIS. THE FIRST PART PAUL OPENS in
[1:32:47] one of the first few scriptures in 1
[1:32:49] Corinthians chapter 1, he commends them.
[1:32:52] HE LETS THEM KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN PLACED.
[1:32:55] He actually says that YOU HAVE BEEN PUT
[1:32:57] IN POSITION. THEY COME BEHIND IN NO
[1:32:59] GIFT. HE COMMENDS THEM AS A FATHER EVEN
[1:33:02] THOUGH HE KNOWS THERE IS WRONG.
[1:33:06] RIGHT?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; But remember,
[1:33:08] it's trying to bring them into that
[1:33:10] place and to deal with that debris
[1:33:13] because there's nothing wrong with the
[1:33:14] water.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Right? And Paul begins to deal with this
[1:33:20] where you have those there that are, you
[1:33:23] know, I'm of Apollos,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; I'm a Cphus.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you friends,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; you know, Brother Brham tells us over
[1:33:33] and over in the message, I can't
[1:33:35] remember exactly the number of quotes,
[1:33:37] four, five quotes, where he says,
[1:33:39] "You've got a punch coming. Satan's got
[1:33:41] a punch coming to you.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; You didn't find it. You can even look at
[1:33:44] the one cler in Christ revealed in his
[1:33:46] own words 64 he said what would you
[1:33:49] rather and he talks about sometimes it
[1:33:51] can be on the physical level or
[1:33:53] emotional level he said would you rather
[1:33:56] not know about it or would you rather
[1:33:59] know about it but keep it covered with
[1:34:01] the blood see God you say well brother
[1:34:03] Sam I thought God just there's I mean
[1:34:06] it's just everything but you realize is
[1:34:08] that there's certain things of
[1:34:10] weaknesses
[1:34:12] that's still within our flesh let me
[1:34:13] just Say this, if we if your thought
[1:34:15] line on the maturing of sons and
[1:34:18] daughters of God is where I'm no longer
[1:34:20] going to have problems as a son and
[1:34:22] daughter of God,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; maturing is recognizing and
[1:34:26] understanding your weaknesses
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and understanding who is your source of
[1:34:31] strength
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and reigning as a son of God over it.
[1:34:34] Now, see that that that that takes a
[1:34:36] real SON OF GOD BECAUSE LISTEN, we're
[1:34:38] prone we're prone in our humanity to
[1:34:41] sometimes blame other people.
[1:34:44] right? For for for things to go on. I
[1:34:46] I'm saying we
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't say you. I say we.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; So, God has to bring us TO THAT. AND GOD
[1:34:52] HAS A WAY OF BRINGING you and I to that
[1:34:54] place to where we begin to see and
[1:34:57] realize and recognizing more and more
[1:35:00] our dependency upon him. And so within
[1:35:03] this of the weaknesses that lay there,
[1:35:06] it's continually to keep it covered by
[1:35:08] the blood. Simply put, what that means
[1:35:10] is is continuing to stay in fellowship
[1:35:14] with him.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "WELL, YOU MEAN GOD WOULD DO
[1:35:17] THAT?" LET ME JUST TELL you something.
[1:35:19] Even when I'm sealed with the spirit of
[1:35:21] God, ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE THERE'S STILL
[1:35:23] THIS HUMAN PART ABOUT us
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; and it's THERE WE ARE MADE TO RELY upon
[1:35:30] God. And God brings us to that
[1:35:32] realization as we're to rest upon him.
[1:35:35] So now with that being said, THAT HUMAN
[1:35:37] PART THAT COULD RE THAT COULD RESIDE
[1:35:39] THERE WHERE PAUL EVEN TOLD HIM, I WANT
[1:35:42] TO SPEAK TO YOU. THERE'S THINGS I WANT
[1:35:44] TO SAY.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; He said, but I can't say them. He said,
[1:35:47] I can't speak to you AS SPIRITUAL. HE
[1:35:49] SAID, I HAVE TO SPEAK ON TO AS CARNAL.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; He said because when right NOW WHERE YOU
[1:35:54] SHOULD BE, YOU'RE NOT UP TO THAT POINT.
[1:35:56] YOU SEE WHAT THE WORD IS LETTING THEM
[1:35:58] KNOW THIS IS THE SEASON OF MATURITY.
[1:36:01] UH-HUH.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; NOW, THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GOING TO COME
[1:36:05] ABOUT IN THEIR LIFE IS GOD HIMSELF WHO
[1:36:08] IS A FAITHFUL FATHER IS THERE TO POINT
[1:36:11] THOSE THINGS OUT IN OUR LIFE.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; GOD DOES NOT GIVE YOU AN EYE THE HOLY
[1:36:15] GHOST AND SAY, "OKAY, JUST, YOU KNOW,
[1:36:17] AUTOMATIC EVERYTHING JUST AUTOMATIC."
[1:36:19] IT'S NOT ALL AUTOMATIC.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A LOVE FOR THE THINGS OF GOD.
[1:36:24] BUT YOU LEARN, you grow, and you
[1:36:26] RECOGNIZE IN YOUR LIFE OF EVEN THINGS of
[1:36:29] your weakness as things you can give
[1:36:31] yourself to and things you can't.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And it don't have nothing to do with the
[1:36:35] other person sitting beside you. It's
[1:36:36] you.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; And it affects decisions you make.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; That's part of your personal walk.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; But here is the Corinthian church and
[1:36:46] here they are sitting here in this
[1:36:48] moment and I'm of Paulus. I'm of Cphus.
[1:36:50] I'M OF THERE WAS SUCH DIVISION. NOW, I
[1:36:53] DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE, you know, NO
[1:36:55] DOUBT MAYBE getting out debating. I I I
[1:36:57] don't know if they were all what THEY
[1:36:58] WERE DOING, BUT WHAT IT IS, IT DIDN'T
[1:37:00] MATTER IF THEY WERE SAYING it all out
[1:37:02] here OR IF THEY WERE SAYING IT JUST IN
[1:37:04] POCKETS AND THEY HAD POCKETS IN THIS
[1:37:06] HOUSE THAT THIS WAS THE POCKET IN THE
[1:37:08] Corinthian church for Cphus. THIS WAS
[1:37:10] THE POCKET FOR APOLLOS. THIS WAS THE
[1:37:13] POCKET FOR PAUL AND this was the pocket
[1:37:15] for Christ.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they had that. Yeah,
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; BUT YET THEY ALL CAME TOGETHER
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; UNDER THE SAME ASSEMBLY
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SEEING WAIT A MINUTE THE OASIS
[1:37:32] THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US BUT WHAT IS TAKING
[1:37:35] WHAT'S HINDERING IS DIVISIONS AMONG US.
[1:37:37] NOW, LET ME JUST say this to you. The
[1:37:40] question, I want you to listen
[1:37:41] carefully. The question,
[1:37:45] there was not really so much one right
[1:37:49] answer
[1:37:51] what the dispute was all about.
[1:37:54] Are you hearing me now?
[1:37:57] As I said last week, a misunderstanding
[1:38:00] is not about somebody's right and
[1:38:02] somebody's wrong. Right?
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Not going to go all there, but that's
[1:38:06] that's not what that's about.
[1:38:08] Misunderstanding is about when there's
[1:38:11] been a misunderstanding.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Someone doesn't know what they've done
[1:38:15] and this other person's been offended or
[1:38:17] vice versa or what back and forth and
[1:38:18] everything that's led to all this. But
[1:38:20] you see within those things, how Paul is
[1:38:23] bringing it to this place, Paul steps
[1:38:26] down and as a father, HE LETS THEM KNOW,
[1:38:28] WAIT A MINUTE HERE.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I planted, APOLLOS WATERED, BUT GOD GAVE
[1:38:35] THEIR INCREASE.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S HE DOING? PAUL'S BRINGING THE
[1:38:38] FOCUS BACK [screaming] TO
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; THE RIGHT, THE WATER SUPPLY AND THE
[1:38:42] OASIS. HEY, GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY.
[1:38:45] [screaming]
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS I'M
[1:38:49] RIGHT. YOU'RE WRONG. LISTEN, THAT THAT
[1:38:51] THAT'S NOT REMOVING DEBRIS. THAT'S ONLY
[1:38:54] PUSHING THE DEBRIS IN THE WATER. THERE'S
[1:38:57] ONLY ONE WHO'S RIGHT AMONG US, AND
[1:38:59] THAT'S THE WORD.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONE. THAT'S THE ONE. AND
[1:39:03] LISTEN, WHEN WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT
[1:39:04] RIGHT AND WRONG, THE WORD is
[1:39:06] reconciliation. And reconciliation, WHEN
[1:39:09] IT'S TRUE, RECONCILIATION DOES NOT GLORY
[1:39:12] IN CORRECTION. RECONCILIATION IS ABOUT
[1:39:16] TO SEE A LIFE RESTORED BACK INTO
[1:39:19] FELLOWSHIP.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; ANYTHING ELSE IS A WRONG SPIRIT.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; NOW, IT'S A QUESTION, but you know, even
[1:39:28] within all of these things, we have to
[1:39:30] really really look at it and deal with
[1:39:32] IT AND SEE GOD BRINGS US TO things in
[1:39:35] our life. He brings us to things in our
[1:39:38] life. Like when you consider Israel come
[1:39:40] out of the Red Sea,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:43] Just watch this. They come out of the
[1:39:45] Red Sea. My goodness. Miriam had the
[1:39:47] tambourine. Man, she was coming ACROSS
[1:39:49] AND DANCING.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; MY, SHE WAS REJOICING. WHO WOULDN'T BE
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; TO SEE THE TASK? I MEAN, THINK ABOUT THE
[1:39:56] SUPERNATURAL HAPPENED. AND then to be
[1:39:58] able TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THE HORSE
[1:39:59] RIDER AND HIS HORSE
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; TO SEE POWERS DESTROYED BEHIND YOU.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; TO SEE TASK MASTERS THAT SAID, "I'M
[1:40:07] GOING TO BRING YOU BACK."
[1:40:09] [applause and cheering]
[1:40:10] WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPY
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; TO SEE GOD MADE A WAY? AND BROTHER, THEY
[1:40:14] WEREN'T WALKING ACROSS ON SQUISHY
[1:40:16] GROUND. IT WAS DRY GROUND.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN EXCITED? WHO
[1:40:21] WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPY? WHAT
[1:40:22] [screaming] HAPPENED IN THAT MOMENT?
[1:40:24] YES, IT WAS A NATURAL WATER SOURCE. IT
[1:40:27] WAS OPENED UP. BUT WHO MADE A WAY
[1:40:29] THROUGH THAT NATURAL WATER SOURCE? I
[1:40:31] TELL YOU WHO DID IT. THE RIVER OF
[1:40:33] [screaming] LIFE. OUR OASIS. WHEN THEY
[1:40:37] WERE IN THE MIDDLE AND THEIR BACKS WERE
[1:40:39] UP AGAINST THE WALL, [screaming] GOD
[1:40:40] HIMSELF STEPPED ON THE SEA AND SAYS, "I
[1:40:44] AM YOUR WAY."
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; They come right out of that meeting.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; And are led right to the waters of Mara.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; How many it would seem like, Lord, I've
[1:40:59] just come from camp meeting. There ought
[1:41:01] to be a camp meeting service, camp
[1:41:02] meeting service, camp meeting service,
[1:41:03] camp meeting service. And if it's not,
[1:41:06] let's create it.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; We don't want to do that. That becomes a
[1:41:10] sister.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; It's that that that's why you have it's
[1:41:16] why you have when you find different
[1:41:18] ones I've heard. I'm not talking about
[1:41:19] the message, but I'm heard of different
[1:41:20] ones. And what they refer to as
[1:41:22] Pentecost is worship and live worship on
[1:41:25] the stage and and the pounding of
[1:41:27] tambourines and and emotion and all that
[1:41:29] right there. That's not Pentecost.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you a definition. the
[1:41:34] prophet did in spoken word's original
[1:41:35] seed. Simply put, three word sentence,
[1:41:39] Pentecost is God.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; PENTECOST IS THE JUBILEE of the re of
[1:41:45] the revelation OF THE ATONEMENT SOUNDING
[1:41:48] IN YOUR LIFE THAT THE SIN DEBT HAS BEEN
[1:41:51] PAID AND YOU WERE INCLUDED IN CALVARY
[1:41:54] AND THE RESURRECTION. YOUR NAME IS
[1:41:56] WRITTEN ON THE BOOK AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:41:59] COMES TO SEAL YOUR LIFE. IT MAKES GLAD
[1:42:02] THE CITY OF GOD.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; IT PUTS A JOY THAT DON'T WITH THE ORGAN
[1:42:07] DON'T HAVE TO BE GOING.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; The piano don't have to BE GOING.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SINGING A CERTAIN
[1:42:13] SONG. IT MAKES GLAD THE CITY OF
[1:42:14] [screaming] GOD. YOU CAN BE WALKING
[1:42:16] RIGHT THROUGH
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; TAR
[1:42:19] GOING RIGHT THROUGH THERE, WALMART OR
[1:42:21] WHATEVER MORE. AND MY GOODNESS, YOU
[1:42:23] BEGIN TO MEDITATE ON THE LORD. YOU CAN
[1:42:25] HAVE WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BROTHER? WHAT
[1:42:27] YOU'LL FIND IS THE STREAMS. THEY'RE NOT
[1:42:30] LIMITED TO NOT GOING IN THOSE PLACES,
[1:42:32] BUT IT'S WHERE YOU ARE. [screaming] YOU
[1:42:34] ARE A PART OF THE CITY OF GOD.
[1:42:37] [cheering] YOU'RE A PART OF THE BODY OF
[1:42:39] JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE A PART OF THIS WORD
[1:42:42] [screaming] AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE
[1:42:44] STREAM OF LIFE. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO
[1:42:46] MEDITATE ON THE things of God, it comes.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Pentecost equipped us to live right
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; here. They are in Mara. Man, a bitter
[1:42:58] place. Bitter. They could have started
[1:43:01] complaining. But God let Moses see here.
[1:43:07] Here's a little tree. Cut it down and
[1:43:10] put it in the water. Now, you would look
[1:43:12] and say, "I thought we were taking
[1:43:14] debris out of the water." Yeah, we're
[1:43:15] taking what don't belong in there,
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; but we want But in order to do that, we
[1:43:20] want to put Christ in it.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; That means bring Christ in every
[1:43:23] situation. Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you don't have to try to figure it
[1:43:26] out. Just bring him into the situation.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have to chemically figure out
[1:43:30] the how do I turn this water from bitter
[1:43:33] no to sweet. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
[1:43:35] JUST BRING HIM INTO IT. YOUR TEST, YOUR
[1:43:37] TRIAL, A SITUATION AFTER COMING OUT OF A
[1:43:40] GLORIOUS SERVICE, A GLORIOUS MEETING.
[1:43:42] DON'T TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. JUST BRING
[1:43:43] HIM INTO YOUR LIFE. THAT'S WHY HE MADE
[1:43:45] HIMSELF KNOWN IN THE PARTING OF THE RED
[1:43:48] SEA. AND THEN THROUGH THIS AMARA, he
[1:43:50] laid it as an ordinance. I'm the Lord
[1:43:53] that health thee.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; You're going to have times of bitter
[1:43:56] sickness,
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; sometimes bitter trials, cuz life,
[1:44:01] listen to me, life itself is bitter.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; But the challenge is don't become bitter
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; from life,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; That that's the challenge.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And the only way to to to fight that is
[1:44:18] to bring Christ into it,
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; right? is to let the Lord come into it
[1:44:22] IN EVERY SITUATION. LORD, DRAW ME CLOSER
[1:44:25] TO YOU. LORD, SHOW ME HOW HOW I'M TO BE
[1:44:28] IN THIS SITUATION. LORD, DO THROUGH MY
[1:44:31] LIFE AS A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. YOU
[1:44:33] KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO ARISE. IT MIGHT
[1:44:35] HAVE TAKEN ME BY SURPRISE, BUT YOU KNEW
[1:44:36] THIS WAS GOING TO ARISE. EVERYTHING
[1:44:38] SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING RIGHT. IT'S GOING
[1:44:40] GREAT ON MY JOURNEY. WHAT DO I DO? DON'T
[1:44:42] TURN BACK. DON'T PULL AWAY, BUT JUST
[1:44:45] LOOK AND SAY, "GOD, LET ME SEE YOU RIGHT
[1:44:47] NOW."
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU CAN JUST SEE HIM AND BRING
[1:44:51] HIM TO INTO your situation, that'll
[1:44:54] change things.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; And then God will bring you from Mara to
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Elim.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Where there's 12 wells of water, where
[1:45:01] there's some worship.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you've brought me through. Lord,
[1:45:07] you gave me strength. And not only did
[1:45:08] he bring me through, but God, you gave
[1:45:11] me a word to let me know there's going
[1:45:14] to be more maras. But as there's more
[1:45:17] maras, you're still the same God.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; No matter if it's a mara here or a mara
[1:45:22] here, you're still the same God.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's where the enemy, he
[1:45:27] likes to get us discouraged. But I want
[1:45:28] you to remember that it's God's
[1:45:30] business, the prophet said, to take care
[1:45:32] of what he himself has took to himself.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; God is watching over you.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; There's where discouragement will want
[1:45:42] to want to come in. It's always in those
[1:45:44] times where the enemy really likes to
[1:45:46] try to pour it on you when you get
[1:45:47] discouraged. I won't ask you to raise
[1:45:48] your hand
[1:45:50] because we've all been discouraged. You
[1:45:53] might be sitting here this morning and
[1:45:54] are discouraged. And it can be for such
[1:45:56] A VARIETY OF REASONS, BUT THAT'S THE
[1:45:58] VERY TIME THAT THE ENEMY LIKES TO POUR
[1:46:00] IT ON.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, YOU SAY, "HOW COULD HE
[1:46:03] POUR IT ON IN HERE?" HE'D LIKE TO POUR
[1:46:05] IT ON IN HERE AS THOUGH THAT THE WORD IS
[1:46:07] AGAINST YOU. RIGHT. RIGHT.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; HE'D LIKE TO POUR IT ON HERE AND TRY TO
[1:46:12] INTERPRET AND TRY TO MAKE YOU OUT TO BE
[1:46:14] JUDAS.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; HE'D LIKE TO POUR IT ON AND TRY TO MAKE
[1:46:18] YOU OUT TO BE CAIN.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, FRIENDS.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO TRY
[1:46:25] TO DISCOURAGE. YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
[1:46:26] DO IT. YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.
[1:46:28] YOU AND GOING ON AND ON AND ON. BUT
[1:46:30] LISTEN LISTEN. THIS IS WHERE THAT WITHIN
[1:46:32] THE MIDDLE OF IT. IT'S THAT WE MUST GOD
[1:46:34] GIVE US THE STRENGTH TO CAST THAT ASIDE.
[1:46:37] I'LL JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU, FRIENDS.
[1:46:39] IF WE CAN JUST BE HONEST WITH THE
[1:46:40] FOUNTAIN OF LIFE AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT
[1:46:42] TO CAST THAT THOUGHT ASIDE." CUZ I CAN'T
[1:46:44] GET ANYWHERE WITH THAT THINKING, BUT I
[1:46:46] NEED STRENGTH.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I NEED THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE TO GET
[1:46:50] BETWEEN ME AND THAT THOUGHT.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; I NEED THE HOLY SPIRIT TO GET BETWEEN ME
[1:46:55] AND THAT THOUGHT. LORD, I'M INVITING YOU
[1:46:57] RIGHT WHERE I'M AT, LORD GOD, TO GET
[1:47:00] BETWEEN me
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and that discouragement. Hallelujah.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Hagar was at a point of death.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; She had a the prophet called it. She had
[1:47:14] a sister with her and her sister ran
[1:47:17] out. I want you to watch how God is so
[1:47:20] mindful.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; You got to look at this in the
[1:47:23] scripture. Here she is by a fountain
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; and she doesn't even realize what's
[1:47:30] there.
[1:47:32] She's at a point of dying,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And she's expecting. She's expecting
[1:47:38] with child. SHE'S BEEN PUT OUT OF THE
[1:47:40] CAMP,
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Sarah Sarah ran her out of the camp.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Sarah did before Sarah ran her
[1:47:50] out of the camp. You know, she wanted to
[1:47:54] just completely, you know, get rid You
[1:47:55] know what?
[1:47:57] Well, I'm not going to go there. I'll
[1:47:59] just let me just stay here with this cuz
[1:48:00] that that'll get me on a it'll get me on
[1:48:02] another another string and it'll take me
[1:48:03] a while to get into that point. But the
[1:48:06] point coming to is she's been
[1:48:08] misunderstood. She don't have no idea
[1:48:09] why in the world am I out here?
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Why in the world have I been run off?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes, let me tell you
[1:48:16] something. The Bible tells us that
[1:48:21] whatever seed we sow, we'll reap it.
[1:48:24] And sometimes the way, let me just
[1:48:27] preach now. Sometimes the way that the
[1:48:30] enemy will want to dis
[1:48:34] uh disorient
[1:48:35] the word is as is as though any wrong
[1:48:40] seeds that I've sown, I don't have to
[1:48:44] deal with them.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; That somehow the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:48:50] it takes care of all that. I don't have
[1:48:51] to deal with them.
[1:48:54] Wow,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; I got your attention now.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, he takes care
[1:49:01] of unbelief.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; But if there are actions and behaviors
[1:49:08] that have been done, those seeds, the
[1:49:12] only way you're going to ever be able to
[1:49:14] really, really move on, you've got to
[1:49:17] deal with them.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the hardest thing is
[1:49:21] dealing with a bitter harvest.
[1:49:24] Nobody likes to harvest bitter seed.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; So, we can't say and come to a prayer
[1:49:30] line and SAY, "I WANT THIS BITTER SEED
[1:49:32] TAKEN AWAY." Who wouldn't? And then the
[1:49:35] enemy will work on that. And he gets
[1:49:37] somebody to wear their they're down.
[1:49:39] Now, I'm not talking about listen. I'm
[1:49:41] not talking about your nose or my nose
[1:49:43] or any nose being rubbed in the dirt.
[1:49:44] That's not what I'm talking about.
[1:49:45] There's sometimes there's actions and
[1:49:48] there's seeds that have consequences,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:52] And sometimes within that we have to
[1:49:54] bear out that bitterness. BUT LET ME
[1:49:57] JUST TELL YOU THAT HARVEST OF BITTERNESS
[1:50:00] IS NOT GOING TO BE GRAIN THAT YOU'RE
[1:50:02] GOING TO TAKE AND RECYCLE IT. BUT you've
[1:50:06] got to stay faithful.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; This is where being weary in welloing
[1:50:12] can be hard.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now?
[1:50:16] It's where it takes us really coming to
[1:50:19] terms with what's taking place in our
[1:50:22] life,
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; what's going on and really identifying
[1:50:25] that sea. And you know what? It's only
[1:50:27] let me just I want to say only, but it's
[1:50:29] a season. Are you hearing me?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; It's a season. It's not the rest of your
[1:50:34] life.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; And we can't WE CAN'T WELL THAT THAT
[1:50:37] SEASON DON'T EXIST THEN. NO. GOD WILL
[1:50:39] GIVE YOU THE GRACE TO GO THROUGH THAT
[1:50:41] SEASON. BUT LET ME REMIND YOU WITHIN
[1:50:44] THAT SEASON YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
[1:50:47] SEW the right seed.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Now let me just let me pull one more
[1:50:55] example here.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Here stands the Galatian church. This is
[1:51:02] another
[1:51:04] body of believers. And Paul comes to
[1:51:07] them and he's remember he's notice
[1:51:08] there's something different. Who has
[1:51:10] bewitched you?
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Who who has done this? Now I want you to
[1:51:14] remember God knows our humanity
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; and that among the Gauls when you study
[1:51:22] the the people in their makeup they were
[1:51:25] very fickle people
[1:51:27] that was in their natural makeup. So
[1:51:30] here they were you know and could be
[1:51:33] it's it's evident as Paul said even here
[1:51:35] you find that he said where did this
[1:51:37] persuasion come from?
[1:51:40] you you WERE MADE YOU'RE NOW MADE
[1:51:42] perfect by the law.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHAT PAUL WAS SAYING? WAIT, PAUL
[1:51:48] WAS DRAWING THEIR ATTENTION to and Paul
[1:51:50] SAYS THIS AND BROTHER BROWN PICKS IT UP
[1:51:52] over and over and he says, "You started
[1:51:54] out and with with him, THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:51:58] AND BY FAITH WHO WAS WORKING MIRACLES
[1:52:00] AMONG YOU. LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE IN YOUR
[1:52:02] LIFE. LOOK WHERE HE IT'S HIM THAT HAS
[1:52:03] CALLED YOU UNTO HIMSELF." AND NOW
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; AND NOW GOING BACK to holy days AND AND
[1:52:10] HOLY FEASTS and this and and and it
[1:52:12] WASN'T LIKE THEY HAD BEEN CALLED OUT OF
[1:52:15] THAT. THEY HAD NEVER BEEN A PART OF
[1:52:16] THAT.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WERE MEN WHO IN THEIR OWN
[1:52:21] SELVES WERE unsettled
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; and they WERE UNSETTLED AND THEY came
[1:52:28] into Galatia AND THEY WANTED TO TRY TO
[1:52:31] TAKE THEM BACK TO A PREVIOUS SEASON OF
[1:52:34] THE WORD. That's right.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; SEE, WITH NOT STAYING IN THE SEASON OF
[1:52:38] THE WORD WHERE PAUL TOLD TIMOTHY, "BE IN
[1:52:40] SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON."
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT TO KNOW HOW TO BALANCE IT ALL
[1:52:45] TOGETHER.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T TAKE ISOLATED QUOTES AND
[1:52:49] ISOLATED SCRIPTURES. IT ALL HAS TO COME
[1:52:52] TO SHOW JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME
[1:52:54] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS A CONTINUAL [screaming]
[1:53:00] UNFOLDING OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:53:04] HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET HIMSELF WAS GROWING IN
[1:53:07] REVELATION.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; GROWING IN UNDERSTANDING.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? THINGS THAT YOU KNOW
[1:53:13] HIS UNDERSTANDING BACK THERE WITH EVEN
[1:53:15] HOW THINGS WERE AND HOW IT CAME TO THEM
[1:53:17] NOW. IT NEVER CHANGED MANY OF CERTAIN
[1:53:20] ATTRIBUTES THAT WERE SPOKEN. BUT
[1:53:22] SOMETIMES THE PRINCIPLE OF HOW THINGS
[1:53:24] ARE, HOW THINGS WERE SAID. WHO WAS THAT
[1:53:27] THAT BROUGHT THAT TO LIGHT? IT WAS THE
[1:53:29] LIGHT HIMSELF.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; I trust that makes sense. It's operating
[1:53:40] in the right season. It'd be like you or
[1:53:43] me try if I to try to take my boys and
[1:53:47] treat my boys as though they're five
[1:53:49] years old.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; It's the wrong season.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen in the wrong
[1:53:54] season is is their spirit's going to get
[1:53:56] broke.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Right?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; It's a wrong season. I'm one to tell
[1:54:02] them, "Don't do this. Hey, you do this.
[1:54:03] You do that. You don't do this. You do
[1:54:04] this or you don't do that. You do this."
[1:54:07] Then not only is their spirit broke, but
[1:54:09] when their spirit is broke, there's no
[1:54:12] longer any growth.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; They become dependent upon what dad will
[1:54:17] tell them. WHEN WHEN AS YOUNG MEN
[1:54:20] THEY'RE TO BE NURTURED INTO MANHOOD,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; apply that to the church now. Apply it
[1:54:25] to your life. See, God's not interested
[1:54:27] IN BREAKING OUR SPIRIT. HE'S INTERESTED
[1:54:30] IF WE GET OFF COURSE IS THAT it would be
[1:54:32] lined back up.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; So operating in the right SEASON AND
[1:54:37] THAT'S WHY IT takes the wisdom OF THE
[1:54:40] HOLY SPIRIT. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID
[1:54:42] WE'RE NOT BUILDING A WALL.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; It's a tabernacle of the living God.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; MANY CAN GET ON THAT WALL AND RUN THAT
[1:54:51] WALL AND KEEP RUNNING THAT WALL AND KEEP
[1:54:53] RUNNING THAT RAW. BUT YET GOD, IT TAKES
[1:54:55] GOD, NOT A MAN, BUT GOD. AND THE PROPHET
[1:54:58] SAID, "ONE COMING DOWN FROM ABOVE TO
[1:55:02] TURN THAT CORNER."
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOD HIMSELF THAT HAS TURNED THE
[1:55:09] CORNERS IN EVERY GENERATION.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; PREACH WITH ME NOW. IT'S GOD WHO HAS
[1:55:15] DONE THAT FOR THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:55:17] GOD. AND IN YOUR LIFE, [screaming]
[1:55:19] THERE'S MANY CORNERSTONES, A CHIEF
[1:55:21] CORNERSTONE. THERE'LL BE MANY CORNERS
[1:55:23] YOU'LL HAVE TO TURN. RELATIONSHIPS AND
[1:55:26] ON AND ON. JOB AND SO FORTH. BUT HE
[1:55:28] HIMSELF IS THE ONE WHO IS PRESENT AND
[1:55:31] WILL COME DOWN AND GIVE YOU GRACE TO
[1:55:33] TURN EVERY CORNER.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; EVEN IN THE RAISING OF YOUR CHILDREN, IN
[1:55:38] ALL THOSE THINGS, HE IS THE EVERPRESENT
[1:55:40] HELP IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF LIKE HAGAR. I
[1:55:45] DON'T know about you, but as a parent, I
[1:55:47] found myself like Hagar. Lord, I don't
[1:55:49] know how to approach this.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know how I don't
[1:55:53] know. I don't know how to Oh, I mean, I
[1:55:55] could Yeah, sure. I could step out and
[1:55:58] act like I do. I don't want to act cuz
[1:56:00] you know what? That don't do nothing.
[1:56:03] [snorts]
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; But God, help me.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, God, the answer, it'll come
[1:56:08] in unexpected ways.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Don't ever close yourself off.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Don't be like the
[1:56:15] Corinthian church where you close
[1:56:17] yourself off. I can only receive help
[1:56:18] through this part right here. Don't ever
[1:56:20] do that
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; because when you do that it starts to
[1:56:23] stagnate.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; DON'T CLOSE YOURSELF OUT. GOD HAS MANY
[1:56:28] CHANNELS AND VESSELS HE CAN USE AND THEY
[1:56:30] ARE A DIVERSITY.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; SOME THINGS LISTEN SOMETIMES IT IS NOT
[1:56:37] OUR ANSWERS DO NOT COME THROUGH THE
[1:56:40] CHANNELS that we would choose. That's
[1:56:42] true.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS you need AND YOU
[1:56:47] MUST RECOGNIZE GOD speaking through the
[1:56:49] channel.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Because you see, IF WE DON'T RECOGNIZE
[1:56:54] THAT, we can already become divided.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, so and so's preaching.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, so and so's preaching. You don't
[1:57:01] realize that's a divisive spirit.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't get as much from them. And
[1:57:07] listen, we all have, listen, let me tell
[1:57:09] you, friends, we we every every person
[1:57:11] can have their preferences, but
[1:57:12] remember, don't let your preferences
[1:57:15] dictate
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; your pull.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, God wears many
[1:57:23] complexions.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; God is veiled in a many membered body.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? See, see you have to
[1:57:34] when you deal with that properly in that
[1:57:35] way, then as you deal with that and say,
[1:57:38] "No, that's not right. I'm not going to
[1:57:39] let that resolve right here. I'm not
[1:57:40] going to let because God is able to
[1:57:42] speak right through his channels." Then
[1:57:44] you know what'll happen? You'll find
[1:57:45] even in your own life where you also
[1:57:47] receive confidence because of obeying
[1:57:50] the character of the word to even be a
[1:57:52] help to somebody else.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:58:00] here in Galatian. What had happened?
[1:58:04] How just, you know, let me just let me
[1:58:08] just have just a moment here. Finish
[1:58:09] this. This part, this is only one little
[1:58:12] part of it.
[1:58:14] Here was a church that was going so
[1:58:16] well.
[1:58:18] My goodness, God had I mean, they had
[1:58:21] received Paul
[1:58:23] as an angel,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; a messenger, even as in thestead of
[1:58:28] Christ. They had received they had
[1:58:30] received that word.
[1:58:32] But then things came among them.
[1:58:36] And I want you to notice what happened
[1:58:38] with that seed that was being sown.
[1:58:41] Not only did you have brothers that was
[1:58:43] came down and started to sew the wrong
[1:58:46] seed,
[1:58:48] but Paul watched Peter
[1:58:52] under the pressure
[1:58:54] of other brethren.
[1:58:57] other brethren that did not say anything
[1:58:59] to Peter. But here they are coming down.
[1:59:01] And here is Peter
[1:59:03] with a pork rib in his hand,
[1:59:07] bacon on his saucer.
[1:59:11] He said, "Dear Lord, thank God for the
[1:59:12] blood of Jesus.
[1:59:14] This stuff is good."
[1:59:19] [laughter]
[1:59:24] But because of pressure, God allowed the
[1:59:27] humanity of Peter to be shown.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Soon as Peter saw him coming over the
[1:59:33] hill, [snorts] he changed clothes quick.
[1:59:36] I don't even want them to smell pork on
[1:59:38] me.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; He might have had a shot of Listerine. I
[1:59:42] don't even want them to when I speak to
[1:59:44] him.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You know why that was? Because Peter was
[1:59:52] also unsettled.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Now Peter, I want you to think about
[1:59:57] this. Peter, unlike those other brethren
[1:59:59] that came down, Peter was settled in
[2:00:01] that remember God had given him the
[2:00:03] keys.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; He was the one who preached in the house
[2:00:07] of Cornelius,
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Where the where where it was where it
[2:00:11] was loosed among the Gentiles,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND GOD EVEN LET PETER KNOW BY
[2:00:16] DREAM when Peter when it was SPOKE BY
[2:00:19] DREAM, RISE, KILL, AND EAT. OH LORD,
[2:00:21] IT'S UNCLEAN. AND GOD SPOKE TO HIM BY A
[2:00:24] DREAM. AND PETER DIDN'T EVEN FULLY
[2:00:26] understand it. And even WHEN PETER SPAKE
[2:00:28] THE WORDS, THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME AND FELL
[2:00:32] UPON THEM so that they could not even
[2:00:34] dispute or discredit.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; There's nothing you could do.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And yet Peter
[2:00:43] got caught up in this moment
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; and it it had a ripple effect. That's
[2:00:49] what it says in Galatians. There was
[2:00:50] others, even Barnabas, disassembled.
[2:00:54] Peter's going that way, so am I. If so
[2:00:58] and so's going that way, so am I.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; This is where it becomes dangerous of
[2:01:05] wanting to fit in with certain groups.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in fitting in with
[2:01:12] anybody's group.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in fitting in with
[2:01:15] anybody's mode. I'm not interested if I
[2:01:17] preach here. Oh, they might I I don't
[2:01:19] care. I really don't care because that
[2:01:24] spirit is not the spirit of God.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not anybody tell me that, but
[2:01:29] that's exactly what I would say. It's
[2:01:31] not the spirit of God because then it
[2:01:32] becomes organizational.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And it becomes a well, I'm not going to
[2:01:37] friend that brother. I'm not going to do
[2:01:39] that with that brother. I'm not going to
[2:01:40] do that because that was wrong. Haven't
[2:01:42] we been wrong sometimes?
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; You see, but what happens? It's debris.
[2:01:47] It's debris. And that debris, debris has
[2:01:50] a welcome pathway. Wherever there's
[2:01:52] pride, it brings pride. And then look in
[2:01:54] Galatian here. They were they become
[2:01:57] they become critical.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; They were CRITICAL OF ONE ANOTHER. YOU
[2:02:01] KNOW WHY? Because the wrong word out of
[2:02:04] season entered into their life.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And what it did is it started to cause
[2:02:09] them to compare their own life by how
[2:02:12] good they were with how good they were
[2:02:14] doing. And Paul brings them right back
[2:02:16] little by little by little by little
[2:02:18] showing them the just shall live by
[2:02:23] faith.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; I just went through the whole book of
[2:02:28] Galatians right there. But Paul brings
[2:02:30] them back to that place
[2:02:33] and he's asked them that question.
[2:02:37] Why? Why? What's happened?
[2:02:40] And as you know what's what's incredible
[2:02:42] is that as that rippling effect the word
[2:02:46] and the flow of the spirit of God always
[2:02:48] should be moving us forward
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; It should never is take us backwards but
[2:02:57] move us forwards. You can be tested even
[2:03:00] to come even to try to be drawn back
[2:03:02] into things that God has brought you out
[2:03:04] of.
[2:03:07] Maybe maybe you were a part of a family
[2:03:10] where it was just common place at a
[2:03:12] dinner table to talk about other people.
[2:03:17] And if you're not careful, that very
[2:03:20] same thing can come right back around.
[2:03:24] Things can come right back around to
[2:03:25] start comparing one another. When you
[2:03:29] start comparing yourself to one another,
[2:03:31] that's a sign of backsliding.
[2:03:34] you've fallen away from the grace of
[2:03:36] God.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; We're never to compare ourselves among
[2:03:40] ourselves.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; That's a very unsettling behavior
[2:03:43] because sometimes, listen, let me just
[2:03:44] tell you something. If a person can hear
[2:03:46] and hear that kind of a talk, even
[2:03:48] sometimes as a person getting caught up
[2:03:49] in it, and let me just tell you
[2:03:50] something. Don't blame anybody else if
[2:03:52] you got caught up in the conversation.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; You're guilty, too.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Take ownership of it and say, "You know
[2:03:58] what? I got caught up in it, too.
[2:04:04] I'm talking about cleaning out some
[2:04:05] debris.
[2:04:07] Come on, friends.
[2:04:09] Cleaning out debris and moving those
[2:04:11] things away from our lives because it
[2:04:13] can become very unsettling. It becomes
[2:04:15] very unappealing and a person can think,
[2:04:18] "Does everybody else in there? Is
[2:04:20] everybody else a critic?"
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Is that what this whole message is?
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; We want to be a right representation
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[2:04:32] And I'll tell you, if there's any
[2:04:33] critical spirit, it needs a fresh trip
[2:04:35] to Calvary.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; And needs to remember the grace of God
[2:04:39] that touched its life.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; And if it's never went deep enough yet,
[2:04:44] he's here to take us deeper.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Remember, brother Brandham himself, he
[2:04:50] had to deal with the critical spirit
[2:04:52] things that he was seeing that he kept
[2:04:53] on seeing build up. Listen, let me tell
[2:04:55] you something. I'm closing. Brother
[2:04:57] Brandham even even brings it in this
[2:04:58] place. When you read, just read Word
[2:05:01] Made Flesh India trip. Pull it up on
[2:05:02] your phone. Go into Word Made Flesh
[2:05:04] India trip, click on the tab that says
[2:05:06] current sermon and punch in critical.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Just do that and read that succession of
[2:05:12] quotes. And when you read the incident
[2:05:15] of what took place in India of WHAT A
[2:05:19] FEMALE EVANGELIST went over there and
[2:05:21] did and bered those people, I won't even
[2:05:24] GO INTO IT. YOU WOULD ALMOST LOOK AT IT
[2:05:26] AND SAY, "WELL, HOW COULD YOU NOT BE
[2:05:28] CRITICAL?" But see, what Brother
[2:05:30] Brandham was realizing is not only was
[2:05:33] he being critical of that, he was being
[2:05:36] critical of other ministries.
[2:05:38] He was critical of this. And you know
[2:05:40] what brother Ram said? He said, "I've
[2:05:42] developed
[2:05:44] a critical spirit.
[2:05:46] I've developed," he said, he called a
[2:05:49] critical spirit a selfish spirit
[2:05:52] where it's about me. say, "Oh God, may
[2:05:56] God hear as he directs them with the
[2:05:59] Galatian church, they were to remove the
[2:06:02] debris." I realize that, you know, when
[2:06:04] we look at this, we we just want to
[2:06:06] apply some of these points going forward
[2:06:08] because the fountain of God is still
[2:06:12] just
[2:06:13] as real as it ever was.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:19] And Satan always wants to try to
[2:06:21] minimize the supernatural among us. This
[2:06:25] is why he'll try to get eyes over here
[2:06:27] or eyes over there because he wants to
[2:06:30] minimize the supernatural. The prophet
[2:06:31] said it like this. He said you take
[2:06:33] after he said a meeting. He said, "And
[2:06:36] where where there's been such a
[2:06:37] marvelous meeting where the message has
[2:06:39] went forth, the church has rose to such
[2:06:42] a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit
[2:06:44] until the power of God has thrilled
[2:06:46] every person in there and the glory of
[2:06:48] God falls all around. Signs and wonders
[2:06:50] takes place less than a week, Satan is
[2:06:54] permitted to come into that
[2:06:55] congregation."
[2:06:58] Why does he do it? He said, "God permits
[2:07:01] it." And then the church begins to
[2:07:03] murmur and fall back. Maybe it wasn't
[2:07:06] so. And he said, "That's where we
[2:07:08] failed."
[2:07:10] Brother Brham goes into that quote
[2:07:11] because he said, "You'll Satan will
[2:07:14] point out, well, this person was, man,
[2:07:16] they were shouting the glories of God
[2:07:17] right next to you. Look where they're
[2:07:19] at."
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; He'll point Who's doing that? Satan.
[2:07:23] Brother says that in that quote, Satan.
[2:07:26] Satan points out weakness.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; God ministers to weakness.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Two different things.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Bailac took Balam up to a high place
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; where he was looking down on the people
[2:07:44] of God.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; But when you are in that position, you
[2:07:48] can't see the pillar of fire like you
[2:07:50] need to. Because the only way to see the
[2:07:52] pillar of fire and the atonement is get
[2:07:54] under it and look up
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; and to recognize his grace is above you.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; His grace has brought you SAFE THIS FAR
[2:08:01] AND HIS GRACE WILL LEAD YOU HOME.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Everyone when Paul
[2:08:07] brought that to the Galatian church,
[2:08:10] everyone
[2:08:12] anyone who had maybe been affected, can
[2:08:14] you imagine what their homes was like?
[2:08:15] It wasn't just the church. Can you
[2:08:17] imagine what home life was like? Cuz you
[2:08:19] see, criticalness doesn't stop with just
[2:08:24] you and your family.
[2:08:26] Eventually, you'll start questioning one
[2:08:29] another.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; It It doesn't stop. It keeps going. It
[2:08:33] keeps going. It keeps eating. It keeps
[2:08:35] eating. Why? It's a bacteria.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; It's a wiggle tail.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; It's something that was not meant to
[2:08:41] live or thrive.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, what should I do?
[2:08:45] Well,
[2:08:47] you take it to the Lord in prayer.
[2:08:51] And if there's something that you see
[2:08:54] that's wrong, and I'm going to stop
[2:08:56] right here. Brother Bram says, "You go
[2:09:00] to that brother.
[2:09:04] You go to that sister.
[2:09:08] But don't go." But I've got a word for
[2:09:10] you.
[2:09:14] You got to get it out of your own eye
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; before you can get it out of theirs.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; What we talking about? Getting rid of
[2:09:22] the debris.
[2:09:24] Removing the debris. I know. Listen. I I
[2:09:29] know it's not all together. Maybe it's
[2:09:32] not the most comfortable thing, but yet
[2:09:35] I believe as the people of God,
[2:09:38] we're interested
[2:09:41] in the things of God. We're interested
[2:09:44] in life.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; We're not we're not interested in just
[2:09:49] going through the motions.
[2:09:52] And I'm not saying we have,
[2:09:54] but I believe with things that God
[2:09:56] brings to our hearts, he wants to take
[2:09:58] us deeper.
[2:10:01] And there's certain things right now
[2:10:02] that look
[2:10:04] there's a there there is there is a
[2:10:07] place for prayer lines.
[2:10:10] There is a place for all of those
[2:10:11] things. You you know very clearly I was
[2:10:14] supported all that. What I'm saying is
[2:10:15] is that I've also seen where that how
[2:10:19] Satan it's not with it's not with oh
[2:10:22] brother Sam you conduct prayer lines and
[2:10:24] you're bring confusion. That's not what
[2:10:25] I'm saying. What I'm saying is is that
[2:10:27] the enemy if he can go undetected
[2:10:32] and really what's the root of the
[2:10:33] problem? Because brother Bam says it
[2:10:34] over and over. He says
[2:10:36] we know the cure, but what's the cause?
[2:10:42] Brother B focuses on that over and over.
[2:10:44] So it wasn't just something we just
[2:10:46] sweep people through. Some there's a
[2:10:48] place for that. Sometimes there's things
[2:10:50] where we have to look at and say, "Wait
[2:10:51] a minute, God, I remedy out any debris,
[2:10:54] anything in in me. Maybe there's
[2:10:56] something that is still God's bringing
[2:10:58] us to a place to get hung up." And
[2:10:59] friends, I'm not saying that, "Oh,
[2:11:01] there's debris laying everywhere." I'm
[2:11:02] just saying that within our life, if God
[2:11:05] would lay these things and stop me right
[2:11:08] in the middle of certain things that I'm
[2:11:11] getting ready to minister and to bring
[2:11:12] and God would bring us into a place last
[2:11:15] week and then into this early Monday
[2:11:18] morning
[2:11:20] and early yesterday morning
[2:11:23] looking over and things are just moving
[2:11:26] through my heart. Oh God, help me. Help
[2:11:28] me to get it all down. I reach over and
[2:11:30] grab one of my iPads and start typing in
[2:11:33] more.
[2:11:36] We have need of him.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; And if it's not so much as to clean
[2:11:42] debris, it's to keep it out.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:11:49] It's to keep it out. We are
[2:11:53] part of that city of God. There is a
[2:11:56] river where the streams thereof make
[2:11:59] glad. The city of God.
[2:12:03] God is in the midst of her.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; I believe God is dwelling in the midst
[2:12:07] of us.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; I want him to be fully I want him to be
[2:12:10] I want God to be be free. We want him to
[2:12:14] be free in our lives. Want the Holy
[2:12:18] Spirit. Lord
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; just search me Lord. Look when I say
[2:12:22] friends search me. I like brother
[2:12:23] Brandon when he preaches invisible
[2:12:24] union. He said, "God, don't leave my
[2:12:26] heart out."
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram just didn't take things that
[2:12:29] wouldn't for granted. But God searches.
[2:12:30] And neither is it mean where, "Oh my
[2:12:33] goodness, I'm repenting. I don't know
[2:12:34] what I'm repenting for." You're missing
[2:12:36] it.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; That's that's not that's not that's not
[2:12:38] at all.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; It's just simply God, search me.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Direct me. Sometimes these things, beams
[2:12:50] and tires or whatever more are things
[2:12:53] that we can't get on on our own,
[2:12:57] we have to go to one another
[2:13:00] in order to get these out.
[2:13:04] But God is merciful.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; God is merciful.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[2:13:20] Lord Jesus,
[2:13:23] we raised our hands, Lord, even in the
[2:13:25] beginning of service.
[2:13:28] And Lord, we've asked for your mercy.
[2:13:30] Lord,
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; there was so many different Lord, so
[2:13:34] many different needs among us, Lord. And
[2:13:36] we know that, God, that you're the
[2:13:38] supplier, you're the satisfier,
[2:13:43] Lord Jesus.
[2:13:48] We're so thankful
[2:13:50] there is a river.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; So thankful that you are Lord our oasis.
[2:14:01] Lord we we see Lord our responsibility.
[2:14:07] That's our heart's desire, Lord. [music]
[2:14:09] that not only in her own life and her
[2:14:12] own walk, but Father, each one that
[2:14:14] would come in here,
[2:14:18] God, they would really have an
[2:14:20] experience
[2:14:23] with you and really become their oasis
[2:14:30] at that river of life, oh God, they
[2:14:32] would have that same experience, Lord,
[2:14:35] where then out of their life would flow
[2:14:39] rivers of living water.
[2:14:43] Lord, I no doubt Lord as many of us Lord
[2:14:46] have come to that place
[2:14:51] and Father throughout Lord
[2:14:54] we're a place Lord
[2:14:57] that God where the sick and where the
[2:14:59] needy
[2:15:01] gathers.
[2:15:03] Not a not a gathering of perfect people,
[2:15:08] but Lord God, a gathering of hearts and
[2:15:10] lives that believe and are resting in a
[2:15:14] perfect sacrifice,
[2:15:16] a perfect word that's been delivered by
[2:15:18] a perfect God
[2:15:20] and a perfect Holy Spirit among us,
[2:15:24] a perfect fountain
[2:15:26] that's able
[2:15:30] to satisfy the thirst.
[2:15:35] Lord Jesus,
[2:15:37] we ask here this morning, Lord.
[2:15:43] Lord God, even as the word's searching
[2:15:46] our lives, even
[2:15:48] Lord, even as we will come to a place
[2:15:51] and we'll be dismissed from one
[2:15:52] another's presence.
[2:15:55] But Lord, we're asking may the word just
[2:15:58] continue to move in our lives.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Giving discernment, Lord, alerting us,
[2:16:06] knowing that when Paul would write to
[2:16:08] the Galatian church and say, "Stand fast
[2:16:10] in the liberty wherewith Christ have
[2:16:12] made you free and be not entangled again
[2:16:15] in the yoke of bondage." Lord,
[2:16:19] it was letting them know, reminding
[2:16:22] them, stand fast in this liberty.
[2:16:25] Father,
[2:16:27] we see as your prophet many places he
[2:16:30] said it, how that the enemy
[2:16:33] wants to come and will come right among
[2:16:35] us. He's permitted to.
[2:16:40] But Lord,
[2:16:42] as I hear your prophet say over and over
[2:16:44] and over again,
[2:16:46] it's not my brother,
[2:16:49] it's the enemy that's got between us.
[2:16:55] Lord Jesus,
[2:16:59] if any feelings would be any other way
[2:17:01] contrary,
[2:17:03] would you just open eyes this morning?
[2:17:06] Open our eyes like you did, Gahesus,
[2:17:10] that we can see it in the right light,
[2:17:13] Lord.
[2:17:15] That we might go with a
[2:17:20] Lord, a [music] real
[2:17:22] discernment in our heart.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Bless your name,
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Lord. I pray
[2:17:30] maybe Lord that as we come through this
[2:17:32] Lord and look at it.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Will you just give us strength Lord give
[2:17:38] courage to every heart Lord in every
[2:17:40] life.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:17:43] Lord Jesus.
[2:17:47] Whatever it might be, a tractor tire, a
[2:17:50] beam,
[2:17:53] maybe it's something, Lord,
[2:17:56] God to be settled, a misunderstanding.
[2:18:01] But I pray, heavenly father,
[2:18:05] Lord God, for not only the sake
[2:18:09] of our assembly,
[2:18:11] but for the sake of every home.
[2:18:15] Yes, Lord.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. I pray, Father.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord Jesus.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful, God, for your mercies
[2:18:25] among us, Lord.
[2:18:27] It just does our heart, Lord. Just it
[2:18:30] makes us glad.
[2:18:33] There's a gladness about it, Lord. Even
[2:18:35] when there's,
[2:18:37] oh God, when there's things that can be,
[2:18:40] Lord, reconciled,
[2:18:42] or hearts are mended, Lord, it makes
[2:18:45] glad even as you uncover and you
[2:18:50] minister to our weaknesses
[2:18:53] and you help us.
[2:18:57] Strength is ministered to us,
[2:18:58] encouragement, refreshing.
[2:19:02] Oh God, grant it here this morning.
[2:19:04] Lord, we're looking to you, Lord. The
[2:19:07] perfect sacrifice, the perfect blood. Oh
[2:19:10] God, continue to lead and guide us,
[2:19:13] Lord.
[2:19:15] Like your prophet, Lord say over and
[2:19:17] over.
[2:19:20] Oh God,
[2:19:22] we have no creed but Christ,
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; no law but love, and no book but the
[2:19:27] Bible.
[2:19:29] Grant it, Lord Jesus. I pray father
[2:19:33] may you always lord Jesus be before us
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; oh God
[2:19:39] our live the living source of water Lord
[2:19:42] the refreshment our joy our peace Lord
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; you're the restorer of life Lord God
[2:19:50] where the enemy Lord has wanted to steal
[2:19:52] and to take away but you're a restorer
[2:19:54] Lord
[2:19:55] oh God
[2:19:57] may the streams
[2:20:00] from that river
[2:20:02] may it reach
[2:20:04] every heart and every life. I pray
[2:20:08] grant it Lord
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:20:14] a river
[2:20:19] that flows [singing]
[2:20:23] from deep
