[29:21] [Music]
[29:34] [Applause]
[29:47] [Music]
[29:48] [Applause]
[29:49] allelujah so thankful to be in the house
[29:52] of the Lord this morning and you know it
[29:55] wouldn't be even though we've set it
[29:57] aside this is a place that the Lord has
[29:59] given us to come together but it would
[30:01] be no more than just a building if it
[30:04] wasn't his presence but it's his
[30:07] presence that takes a building that
[30:10] would be just made of these bricks could
[30:12] have went and made any building that
[30:13] could have been anything that's been
[30:14] here but it's his presence you know
[30:17] there was a place at one time of a
[30:19] particular church that we knew of and
[30:21] things like that actually we had been
[30:23] there and things and you know after a
[30:26] time where the the ministry did not walk
[30:28] on in with with the Lord and it came to
[30:31] a time that I you know I what I've heard
[30:35] where the individual after I know my dad
[30:39] had spoken and there was some things
[30:41] that that the Lord had letting my dad to
[30:43] deal with and speak on and after after
[30:45] leaving there there was an old Saint and
[30:47] I remember he's only gone to the glory
[30:49] and he said you know because of some
[30:51] things that had to wear that were
[30:53] addressed he said he looked at his he
[30:55] looked at his wife he said mama he said
[30:57] tonight
[30:58] he said Inka bonds been wrote on this
[31:00] door and I'll tell you what happened
[31:02] there and it wasn't because of my dad it
[31:04] was just simply because that you walk on
[31:06] him with the word and what happened
[31:08] there that that place of worship became
[31:11] a dance hall the Prince of the Lord is a
[31:16] very precious thing
[31:17] we always want to reverence it always
[31:20] want to reverence it there might be
[31:21] things and how that the Lord will take
[31:23] the servant of God here this morning and
[31:25] through incoming services and if we just
[31:28] look to the Lord there might be things
[31:30] and how God is moving within that
[31:31] service and sometimes we know it may not
[31:33] seem like it's moving right down our
[31:34] channel but you know what God knows what
[31:37] our need is and you know I wonder when
[31:39] the Lord Jesus was walking down as them
[31:42] among their to the Pool of Bethesda
[31:44] I wonder even maybe that that man that
[31:47] was there that was sitting there there
[31:48] was there was impotent I wonder if he
[31:50] just didn't see the Lord Jesus coming
[31:52] but he didn't know what it was really
[31:54] all about until the Lord Jesus started
[31:56] talking to him you know that's something
[31:58] to how God will come right down through
[32:00] his word and God will take something's
[32:02] it's familiar to us it might be a
[32:03] familiar text it can be something you've
[32:05] heard just in the message this week
[32:06] something the Lord is laid on your heart
[32:08] you've been meditating on but then you
[32:10] find as he draws near he speaks and
[32:13] ministers right to your need he knows
[32:15] right where you're at this morning knows
[32:16] right your need he's mindful of it and
[32:18] we believe we believe he cares how great
[32:22] is his care how great is his love what
[32:24] we want to do is just surrender we want
[32:26] to enter on into it
[32:27] amen is such a wonderful privilege to be
[32:30] in the presence of the Lord amen just
[32:33] thank God for His mercy thing God for by
[32:35] the Jerian sister Mina and Lydia and the
[32:38] grandchildren they brought with them
[32:40] they brought a few with them but we're
[32:42] grateful to have a book Jerry go ahead
[32:44] and come on and we're just we're glad
[32:46] glad to have them here with us and I
[32:48] know that I know there's some that's
[32:50] even probably even more glad than the
[32:51] rest but for the bill sister Mary and
[32:54] her mom and dad but we're just we're
[32:57] thankful amen let's just let's pull on
[33:00] the gift of God now I've asked the Lord
[33:03] when he came here I prayed with him
[33:04] yesterday I asked that God would just
[33:06] really refreshing why they're here but I
[33:08] also want to get everything that God has
[33:11] for me
[33:12] amen and I know what God has for me and
[33:14] has for you it doesn't lay particularly
[33:16] in the individual but it lays in the
[33:18] Lord is that right so that's who we're
[33:20] going to be pulling on we'll be pulling
[33:22] on the Lord Jesus Christ and there many
[33:25] times how God will use you know God will
[33:26] use experiences right through a person's
[33:28] life and God will have certain store
[33:30] sometimes that said in a manner and
[33:33] it'll help open things for you and I we
[33:35] see that all the way through the
[33:36] scripture God will allow things where he
[33:38] comes down and he'll speak in our
[33:40] language things that we can relate to he
[33:43] don't have to but he conned in sins I'm
[33:46] so glad he does that aren't you
[33:47] Amen that's what we want him to do we
[33:49] want him to move right up and down these
[33:51] aisles moving our hearts and our lives
[33:52] and just really speak to us in a
[33:54] personal way

[41:39] crazy praise the Lord it's good to be
[41:47] back here with you again it's been some
[41:50] quite some time since we were here and
[41:52] we've had a fought a lot of battles
[41:56] since then and went to a lot of trials
[41:59] and have learned a lot of things and
[42:02] have growing and God has blessed my
[42:07] family and I'm thankful for that it's
[42:12] always wonderful when you come through
[42:14] some hard trials to come out on the
[42:15] other side you see that God actually had
[42:19] a blessing in store and that's just
[42:23] always wonderful if you stand with me
[42:27] let's just bow our heads in prayer
[42:29] before we go to the scripture this
[42:30] morning Heavenly Father Lord as we come
[42:34] before you lord as we stand behind the
[42:36] sacred desk Lord we approach it with all
[42:40] the reverence in our hearts that we have
[42:42] Lord asking God that you Lord Father
[42:46] would come and anoint us that we may be
[42:48] able to yield you to wear it be a help
[42:51] to the people would be uplifting to them
[42:53] dear God encouraging I pray we ask this
[42:56] Lord in your name and to give all the
[43:00] glory to you amen while you're standing
[43:04] you could terms me in your Bibles to
[43:05] mark chapter 2
[43:30] mark chapter two and I want to begin
[43:33] reading in verse one and again he
[43:36] entered in to compare him after some
[43:37] days and it was noised that he was in
[43:41] the house and straightway many were
[43:44] gathered together and so much that there
[43:46] was no room to receive them no not so
[43:49] much as about the door and he preached
[43:52] the word unto them and they come unto
[43:55] Him bringing one sick of palsy which was
[43:57] borne of four and when they could not
[44:01] come nigh unto him for the press they
[44:03] uncovered the roof where he was and when
[44:06] they had broken it up they let down the
[44:09] bed wherein the sick of palsy lay when
[44:12] Jesus saw their faith he said unto the
[44:14] sick of palsy son thy sins be forgiven
[44:17] thee but there were certain of the
[44:19] scribes sitting there and reasoning in
[44:22] their hearts why does this man speak
[44:23] such blasphemy who can forgive sin but
[44:28] God only and immediately when Jesus
[44:30] perceived in his spirit that they so
[44:32] reasoned within themselves he said unto
[44:34] them why reason you these things in your
[44:37] hearts whether is it easier to say to
[44:39] the sick of palsy thy sins be forgiven
[44:41] thee or to say arise take up thy bed and
[44:44] walk but that you may know that the Son
[44:47] of man hath power on earth to forgive
[44:48] sins he say it to the sick of palsy I
[44:51] say unto thee arise and take up thy bed
[44:54] and go thy way into thine house and
[44:56] immediately he rose and took up the bed
[44:59] and went forth before them all in so
[45:02] much that they all were amazed and
[45:04] glorified God saying we never saw it on
[45:07] this fashion you may be seated I want to
[45:12] just direct your attention back to the
[45:13] third verse and it says and they came
[45:16] unto Him bringing one sick of palsy
[45:19] which was borne of four and if I give
[45:22] this a title this morning I would say
[45:24] born of four I want to look at five
[45:32] words this morning first one has
[45:34] agreement there was four men that had to
[45:38] carry this one that was sick of palsy
[45:41] lay on his bed
[45:43] in order for these four men to be able
[45:45] to carry them they had to first come
[45:46] into agreement one with the other they
[45:49] had to come into agreement that they
[45:51] believed that there that they had a
[45:53] purpose in which to carry this man there
[45:55] they had to come into agreement that
[45:58] they were going to work together to do
[46:01] it and the Lord today if we agree here
[46:09] on earth the Bible says if we agree on
[46:12] earth as touching any one thing that
[46:15] whatever they ask it shall be done unto
[46:17] them of my father so it's important to
[46:23] agree you can't accomplish anything
[46:28] unless you have some agreement
[46:31] I've watched I see that you've got
[46:34] remodeling going on in your church we've
[46:36] had some work done on our church and
[46:38] still have some need of work and and you
[46:42] had to reach an agreement otherwise
[46:45] you'd never get anywhere and you
[46:47] wouldn't accomplish anything first thing
[46:50] you had to agree upon was that there was
[46:52] a need for it then you had to agree upon
[46:56] nervous if there was a reason for it
[46:59] that there was a ability to do it and
[47:03] it's with these four men there had to be
[47:05] a reason for them to carry will course
[47:07] he was sick of sick with palsy but they
[47:11] had to have faith that they weren't just
[47:14] carrying him there to carry him back
[47:16] home they had to have faith that once
[47:20] they got him there that Jesus was going
[47:23] to heal him that was their whole purpose
[47:26] of carrying him there was for Jesus to
[47:29] heal him I like how the Bible says and
[47:32] Jesus was in the house I believe he's in
[47:35] the house this morning
[47:37] a man where the Brenham said in the
[47:42] message of Elijah and the meal offerings
[47:43] said Heavenly Father humbly quietly
[47:45] reverently we come into the light great
[47:48] August before one thing happened you are
[47:52] here because you promised to be we know
[47:56] he's here because he promised to be here
[47:59] and he said before you're going away
[48:02] said whatsoever
[48:05] whatever that two or three gathered in
[48:07] my name there I'll be in there miss so
[48:11] we know it's his promise word and if
[48:14] they shall agree upon any single thing
[48:16] as touching one thing asked they shall
[48:19] receive it that's his word and he's
[48:25] obligated to stand behind his word and
[48:28] here these four had come into agreement
[48:31] that this man was going to receive his
[48:33] healing and so they picked him up to
[48:38] carrying their next word is assignment
[48:44] they had to who was going to who was
[48:48] going to be at what point there's four
[48:50] of them there were four points on the
[48:52] bed to be so who was going to be on one
[48:55] point or the other
[48:57] what if they decided well all four of
[48:59] them said no we want to be in the front
[49:01] we want to be first what if all four
[49:06] them said no I want you to go first I
[49:08] want out full up the rear I'll go last
[49:10] they had to come into an assignment
[49:13] brother Branham says I'm praying and
[49:16] fasting waiting on God I want to do my
[49:18] part while I'm here in California you do
[49:21] your part and get out and get the people
[49:24] in the song leader he's got an
[49:27] assignment to do and he comes and he
[49:30] does his part but if he's the only one
[49:34] saying then you're not doing your part
[49:39] it is in special songs is its leading
[49:43] and singing I remember one time brother
[49:48] feel some years ago was going to teach
[49:50] the group a new song and nobody sang
[49:52] with him and after the service one
[49:55] brother Clem Kenan said I really enjoyed
[49:57] that special brother my brother Phil
[50:00] said it wasn't meant to be a special but
[50:04] we've each got a part to do and I want
[50:06] you to know something
[50:08] there's not one part that's lesser than
[50:10] another you say well I'm not the
[50:13] preacher I'm not the song leader I'm not
[50:15] the musician but you know what you are
[50:19] the congregation what what good would we
[50:22] be to have musicians preachers and song
[50:27] leaders if there wasn't nobody to preach
[50:29] to nobody to help sing nobody to sing to
[50:33] the music what would it be so it's
[50:36] important you play an important part in
[50:39] bringing the presence of God into this
[50:42] house you've got an assignment you know
[50:49] we need to be prayed up when we come we
[50:53] need to come praying and expecting to
[50:56] hear from God not depending on the
[50:59] preacher to bring them to bring the
[51:02] service in his briefcase but we need to
[51:05] you know I'm not going to ask for hands
[51:08] but think of yourself when was the last
[51:10] time you prayed for a service before
[51:12] before you came when's the last time you
[51:16] prayed for the pastor or whoever was
[51:19] speaking before you came took some time
[51:21] not I know you've got time when you come
[51:24] here to set and break but I'm talking
[51:26] about before you get here I'm talking
[51:28] about during the week while the services
[51:30] you're waiting for the service to come
[51:32] up I'm talking about your daily prayers
[51:38] we've all got a part to do and we can't
[51:43] get out of place
[51:45] in the days of of Israel when David was
[51:50] King why the Levites had a part to play
[51:53] but David got out of his place one time
[51:57] got into the place of the Levite and
[51:59] took him on himself on how he was going
[52:02] to bring the ark back and David stepped
[52:05] out of his place and it cost a man his
[52:08] life and he might say well why wasn't
[52:13] David held accountable why was it that
[52:16] user was his life giving well God
[52:20] counted that he had made a choice
[52:23] himself to go along with what they were
[52:26] doing there was one nation that David
[52:33] should have consulted but David didn't
[52:36] consult Nathan the Prophet that was
[52:39] Nathan's assignment but instead David
[52:43] went to the captains and the hosts of
[52:45] thousands and consulted the people
[52:47] whether this would be a good idea to
[52:49] bring the ark down or not and brother
[52:53] branham said he thought he had a real
[52:55] revelation but that wasn't David's
[53:00] assignment David's assignment was to be
[53:02] king and we thought he had something you
[53:09] say what would the wood god reveal
[53:15] something to somebody in the
[53:16] congregation before the pastor he just
[53:20] might just to see what you're going to
[53:22] do with this
[53:25] the pastor he's human
[53:28] he's got to deal with his flesh just
[53:31] like you do he's got to deal with his
[53:33] human spirit just like you do he's got
[53:36] conscious memory reasoning imagination
[53:39] and and that he has to deal with he's
[53:42] got his own personal battles he has to
[53:44] fight his life just ain't all about
[53:48] pastoring
[53:50] he's got a personal walk but God if
[53:57] David would have waited then it would
[54:02] have come the one who was assigned to
[54:04] bring that revelation was Nathan and it
[54:07] would have came to pass it was God's
[54:09] will to bring the ark back and when they
[54:14] deserve that when they done it God's
[54:16] provided way and put it on the shoulders
[54:20] and Levites brother Graham said over the
[54:22] heart of the ministry and brought it
[54:25] back then the ark came back and there
[54:28] was worshiping and there was singing and
[54:30] there was dancing and much joy for lunch
[54:34] God's will for it to come back but it's
[54:39] important for us to stay in ours with
[54:41] our assignment pardon me
[55:03] next word I want to look at his
[55:05] assessment baba said they were gathered
[55:10] around so much within the house that
[55:13] then no one else could get in not even
[55:15] so much as by the door I was in Honduras
[55:22] one time the first time I ever went and
[55:24] I was in I went to a place Porte de
[55:28] cortes up in the north and they had a
[55:31] small church there and had they didn't
[55:34] have glass windows they just had wind
[55:37] their windows was a hole in the adobe
[55:39] wall and had wood shutters they can shut
[55:42] over him and they had all the shutters
[55:44] open and had the door open and had to
[55:46] and the light you know the lanterns and
[55:48] lights they had there why as far as the
[55:51] light would shine out the windows and
[55:53] doors you can see nothing but people the
[55:55] place was packed where there was not
[55:58] even standing room left so the people
[56:00] were standing outside so that they could
[56:03] hear I wonder if we would be that if we
[56:08] would be that way if this place got
[56:10] packed out and there wasn't no more
[56:11] standing room would we say well we're
[56:13] just going to stand where we can hear
[56:15] what's going on are we that hungry so
[56:22] they had to come to an assessment that
[56:25] they wasn't going to make it in by the
[56:26] door we have to come to assessment first
[56:31] to see if what we're doing is God's will
[56:37] see if it's the will of God if it's not
[56:42] the will of God then no matter how good
[56:44] it sounds it's no good so they couldn't
[56:52] get in by the door this assessment means
[56:55] to evaluate to estimate the nature
[56:57] quality ability of someone or something
[56:59] synonyms our evaluation or judgment you
[57:04] know we come to this place to take an
[57:08] assessment of ourselves
[57:10] this is the house of God's judgment this
[57:12] is where judgment begins and when we
[57:15] come in we ought to be saying what
[57:18] portion of this is being spoke is meant
[57:21] for me what is it being said for me to
[57:24] get something out of this what is God
[57:28] trying to tell me today not worried
[57:31] about what God is trying to tell brother
[57:33] so-and-so across the aisle or sister
[57:35] trolling slowly but concerned with what
[57:39] is God speaking to you and are a man's
[57:43] ought to not be throwing say a man has
[57:47] been for him but a man have meant for me
[57:53] I'm in agreement
[57:57] amen amen means so be it
[57:59] and we need to take account evaluation
[58:05] of ourselves and be honest about it and
[58:13] when we see that you know don't be
[58:17] looking for the shortcomings and
[58:18] somebody else looked we see where our
[58:21] own is and I can guarantee you that if
[58:29] that your shortcomings are going to be
[58:31] brought up across the pulpit because
[58:35] they're supposed to and the pastor
[58:38] doesn't always know what's going on in
[58:40] your individual lines he isn't there
[58:43] during the week to watch over everything
[58:45] you're saying or everything you're doing
[58:47] but there is somebody there's an
[58:50] all-seeing eye that's watching you all
[58:52] the time and so when you hear it come
[58:57] across the pulpit you know somebody's
[59:00] been watching
[59:02] but I also believe I also believe
[59:06] there's a scripture way that Paul told
[59:08] us about and that was when Chloe
[59:11] he said I've heard from the house of
[59:13] Chloe sometimes somebody would you know
[59:18] I believe in that too I hear something I
[59:24] don't just jump on it right away I wait
[59:27] till God says move on it sometimes
[59:31] people will see a situation or something
[59:33] going on in the church and they think
[59:36] well my goodness wanting something about
[59:38] this well you don't know is there is
[59:43] something being done and that is the
[59:45] first and most important thing that
[59:47] should be done and that's prayer we
[59:52] should pray about everything in our
[59:54] lives
[1:00:04] assessment they realize they wasn't
[1:00:06] going to get him in by the door so they
[1:00:12] had to come up with another way to get
[1:00:14] him in so they had in signing out how
[1:00:17] how are we going to get him in there and
[1:00:20] the Bible tells us they went up on the
[1:00:22] roof you say how did get up on the roof
[1:00:24] I'm glad you asked me that way their
[1:00:32] buildings were constructed then they had
[1:00:34] flat roofs buildings was constructed of
[1:00:37] mud and stone to make mud and straw and
[1:00:41] stone make bricks and they built up
[1:00:46] their houses and they had a flat roof
[1:00:50] and there was narrow stairway that went
[1:00:55] up the side of the house to the roof
[1:01:00] that's the way it was built and that
[1:01:05] brings us to the next word alignment
[1:01:09] these four men that bore this man sick
[1:01:13] and false you had to get in alignment
[1:01:14] one
[1:01:15] the other in order the deck how they
[1:01:17] were going to take him up that narrow
[1:01:19] staircase say how they do it I don't
[1:01:25] know but the Bible told us that they did
[1:01:27] it to somehow another they found out you
[1:01:31] know you say how what are we aligned
[1:01:33] with we align ourselves with the word
[1:01:35] let's see what the words got to say
[1:01:38] about it maybe they get there to save
[1:01:43] linking him in by the door were you sure
[1:01:45] we're supposed to come said yes I'm sure
[1:01:48] we supposed to come he's sick any where
[1:01:51] do you believe God is going to heal him
[1:01:53] well he said your holy said he's the
[1:01:55] Lord our God that healeth all of our
[1:01:58] diseases well what if what do we have
[1:02:06] disputes this morning we were able to
[1:02:10] get in by the door and by looking out
[1:02:14] there there's still room left on the
[1:02:16] pews so he's in the house then he's here
[1:02:25] to bring healing that's who he is that's
[1:02:29] one of his attributes friends look I'm
[1:02:33] looking forward to the time of the
[1:02:35] resurrection I'm looking forward to the
[1:02:37] time of the body change but I want you
[1:02:39] to know something you won't need divine
[1:02:40] healing then we need divine healing now
[1:02:43] now is the time that he is here to bring
[1:02:47] healing so he had to get an alignment
[1:02:55] one with another in order to decide how
[1:02:58] they were going to get him up that
[1:02:59] staircase also the house was made to
[1:03:05] where there was a hole in the roof it
[1:03:09] was it was small access for one person
[1:03:12] to come in and out at a time there was
[1:03:16] many of the people when Jesus came there
[1:03:19] were people that were worshiping the Sun
[1:03:21] the SU in but they didn't they wouldn't
[1:03:26] nobody up on the roof that day because
[1:03:28] the Esso end
[1:03:29] in the house and they got up on the roof
[1:03:34] and you say well why if they had that
[1:03:38] access hole why didn't they just let
[1:03:39] that man down through that hole they
[1:03:43] couldn't do it that way they had that
[1:03:46] bed had to be down there with him
[1:03:51] because the bed was going to have a
[1:03:54] purpose than it was going to serve and
[1:03:57] you know here the Bible tells us there
[1:04:01] was the scribes critics why did they
[1:04:04] come there in the first place why did
[1:04:06] they even come to deservers to criticize
[1:04:11] if there are so many people packed in
[1:04:14] there that no one else could get in then
[1:04:17] those scribes must have got there first
[1:04:25] sometimes you never think about it but
[1:04:28] let me tell you something that there's
[1:04:30] demons has show up for church sometimes
[1:04:36] they show up carried in in flesh where
[1:04:41] the devil's thereon ever hand and I'm
[1:04:43] like what is Satan saying then you drive
[1:04:47] back thousand demons there's ways they
[1:04:50] praise God you drive back thousand
[1:04:52] little that way because why the angels
[1:04:56] of God dwell in the praises of God's
[1:04:58] people where people are praising God
[1:05:01] there's angels of God there
[1:05:07] but brother branham said never getting
[1:05:10] there's three kinds of believers and
[1:05:13] here we found one of them they come
[1:05:15] there to criticize they come there to
[1:05:17] find fault and Jesus you think it have
[1:05:24] been enough when he told them what they
[1:05:27] were thinking the very thoughts of their
[1:05:29] heart but they were they were so set on
[1:05:43] finding fault that they they weren't
[1:05:47] there at all to to find whether it was
[1:05:51] true or not
[1:05:52] they already didn't believe it but there
[1:05:59] was a reason they had to be there that
[1:06:04] is because God wanted some witnesses
[1:06:07] that day among the unbelievers he wanted
[1:06:15] them to witness the power of God on
[1:06:19] earth and that's why testing him - he
[1:06:25] said my sins are forgiven the last word
[1:06:35] I want to look at his amazing grace
[1:06:39] amazing grace they begin to break up the
[1:06:47] roof in order to have it big enough to
[1:06:51] lower that bed down through there where
[1:06:57] the RAM said one day he was sitting in a
[1:06:59] house teaching the first thing you know
[1:07:01] stuff begin to fall around the floor I
[1:07:04] can't imagine him lookin sudden wonder
[1:07:07] who's climbing up there in a few minutes
[1:07:09] something else began to fall and they
[1:07:14] were taking the roof off the house
[1:07:17] they had some fella there they was going
[1:07:21] to bring him over to get him before the
[1:07:24] Lord and now this fella might not have
[1:07:27] had very much faith so they was going to
[1:07:31] let him down Jesus looking at the man
[1:07:34] know that he had sinned and done wrong
[1:07:36] but perceiving their faith whose faith
[1:07:39] the faith of the for he perceived the
[1:07:47] faith of the for they had faith he said
[1:07:51] maybe this man didn't have much faith
[1:07:53] but the far that got him there had faith
[1:07:56] that God was going to heal him and God
[1:07:59] look after Jesus look after faith and he
[1:08:03] recognized that faith now they weren't
[1:08:09] just saying they believe they took
[1:08:12] action upon it that's why they were
[1:08:15] tearing up the rough because they had
[1:08:19] faith if they can just hit this man
[1:08:22] before Jesus and then we're willing to
[1:08:26] do whatever it took to getting there so
[1:08:30] they were willing to start to tear up
[1:08:33] the roof maybe you know it could have
[1:08:37] been one concern said what were the
[1:08:40] owner of the house thing because I am
[1:08:41] worried about what the owner of the
[1:08:42] house thinks they can build a new roof
[1:08:44] we got to get this man down before Jesus
[1:08:46] this is the only way to get him in there
[1:08:49] so we got to do this so they before them
[1:08:54] begin to break that roof up and they
[1:08:57] broke up a hole big enough the Bible
[1:09:00] said that they lowered the bed down
[1:09:03] through the hole in the roof and lowered
[1:09:06] the bed down to the floor of the house
[1:09:08] right before Jesus now isn't that
[1:09:13] something that Jesus was just standing
[1:09:15] in the right location
[1:09:17] [Applause]
[1:09:25] he's always there he's always in the
[1:09:30] right location he's always on the right
[1:09:32] spot we just got to get to where he's at
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:41] and the Lord this bed down there and
[1:09:44] here was he scribes the ones that was
[1:09:47] going to question him and they would saw
[1:09:51] this man lowered down through the roof
[1:09:53] imagine them being there to criticize
[1:09:55] they said I look at this now we never
[1:10:00] seen none of this in our synagogues
[1:10:07] crazy people
[1:10:13] hallelujah and then jesus said that sins
[1:10:20] be forgiven thee but I'm said he knows
[1:10:25] that the man
[1:10:26] knowing the thoughts of his heart he
[1:10:28] said your sins are forgiven you and said
[1:10:33] get up and go on how to leave ask the
[1:10:37] thing that we need everywhere else today
[1:10:40] a revelation of the power of the
[1:10:42] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:44] through the speaking of his word and it
[1:10:47] has life so here this man Laden jesus
[1:10:52] said thy sins be forgiven you imagine
[1:10:55] this man what his thoughts were he's
[1:11:00] still laying there on the bed but all of
[1:11:03] a sudden there's a freedom his sins have
[1:11:08] been forgiven what about the day that
[1:11:10] you found out he had forgiven all your
[1:11:13] sin
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] [Applause]
[1:11:21] because maybe in your past there might
[1:11:25] have been some awful things things you
[1:11:28] wouldn't want known here this morning a
[1:11:30] man but they're all forgiven too and God
[1:11:37] put him in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:11:40] that means God don't remember him no
[1:11:43] more brother Vance said if you done
[1:11:48] wrong and I knew about it he said I can
[1:11:50] forgive you but I couldn't forget it but
[1:11:53] God has the power to forget it say how
[1:11:56] can he do that it's because it goes back
[1:11:59] on the original owner of the sin
[1:12:06] who's going to give account for all that
[1:12:09] there's an old fella is going to give
[1:12:11] account for all that with the old man
[1:12:18] that was involved in doing that he's
[1:12:19] dead
[1:12:23] hallelujah on that day we won't stand in
[1:12:26] judgment to stand before the judgment
[1:12:29] seat why because we set in judgment here
[1:12:32] and let him change our lives
[1:12:35] [Applause]
[1:12:40] I've heard they say some people don't
[1:12:43] like change and I say well it depends on
[1:12:48] maybe what the change is but if you've
[1:12:51] once been bound and now you're free you
[1:12:55] can enjoy that change I don't know you
[1:13:00] there's been a change in me that old man
[1:13:05] is dead I'm not the man I used to be
[1:13:18] they said who is this man to forgive
[1:13:21] sins only God can forgive sin and Jesus
[1:13:26] said he perceived said why reason you in
[1:13:30] your hearts and he said is it easier to
[1:13:34] say thy sins be forgiven thee or take up
[1:13:37] thy bed and walk and then he said why
[1:13:40] that he said it that way jesus knew they
[1:13:42] were there to criticize he identified
[1:13:45] them the moment they walked through the
[1:13:47] door
[1:13:50] but he also identified everyone that was
[1:13:53] going to believe that walked through
[1:13:55] that door and so jesus said I said it
[1:14:03] that way that you may know that the Son
[1:14:06] of man has power on earth to forgive sin
[1:14:09] I want you to know he's got power on
[1:14:12] earth to forgive sins and smartie I'm
[1:14:16] not the priest that you got to come and
[1:14:19] confess your sin to me you confess it to
[1:14:21] Almighty God but he's here this morning
[1:14:25] if there's anybody here that needs
[1:14:27] forgiveness he's here in the house this
[1:14:30] morning to give forgiveness
[1:14:38] amazing grace so then he said to the man
[1:14:44] said take up your bed arise and go forth
[1:14:53] and the Bible says immediately
[1:14:59] immediately the man who have been sick
[1:15:02] of palsy he didn't wait on his bed and
[1:15:05] say I wonder if this is true I wonder
[1:15:09] friends he had done been through it
[1:15:13] people had done tore up a roof on the
[1:15:15] house to get him down there before Jesus
[1:15:18] and notice this he got his mind so on
[1:15:25] Jesus he wouldn't pay no attention to
[1:15:26] them scribes
[1:15:28] they didn't discourage him when Jesus
[1:15:32] said I'll forgive your sin his faith
[1:15:34] soared he might have just had a little
[1:15:38] bit of faith when they let him down but
[1:15:40] when Jesus said law life sins are
[1:15:42] forgiven you he had great faith if he
[1:15:46] can forgive my sins he can heal me of
[1:15:49] any disease and so the Bible says he
[1:16:00] merely he rose and took up the bed and
[1:16:04] went forth before them all now I want
[1:16:09] you to know something the reason that he
[1:16:12] had to be lowered on the bed was so that
[1:16:15] in front of witnesses he could get off
[1:16:17] the bed and pick up the bed because he
[1:16:24] wouldn't he needed he was carried in by
[1:16:26] the bed but it was God's will for him to
[1:16:29] carry the bed out and he couldn't go
[1:16:36] back up by the roof but the people were
[1:16:40] so amazed can you imagine the people as
[1:16:43] he got up and began to walk toward him
[1:16:44] carrying his bed and then just making a
[1:16:47] path for it well hallelujah he might
[1:16:53] have been let down through the ceiling
[1:16:55] but he left by the door
[1:16:57] [Applause]
[1:17:11] Amazing Grace his sins were forgiven he
[1:17:18] was healed of his disease he was able to
[1:17:22] walk you imagine when he got outside and
[1:17:26] got reunited with the four that he
[1:17:28] carried him there hallelujah there they
[1:17:37] were up on the roof looking down and
[1:17:38] witness all this I imagine they got down
[1:17:41] off that roof as quick as they could so
[1:17:43] they could go meet him when he came out
[1:17:44] the door
[1:17:46] hallelujah I believe he's here don't you
[1:17:56] I believe that he can forgive sin I
[1:18:01] believe that he can heal us there may be
[1:18:07] some things that we have to go through
[1:18:12] there may be some sicknesses that we
[1:18:15] have to battle and the Lord of lettuce
[1:18:20] but he's there to heal what a reunion
[1:18:30] they had praise God I imagined the five
[1:18:34] of them just jumping up and down just
[1:18:36] praising God outside shaking one
[1:18:42] another's hands hugging one of those
[1:18:43] necks matching him telling them for
[1:18:46] thank you for carrying me here
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:18:52] brother branham said when he went on to
[1:18:55] see the other side said they were saying
[1:18:58] my precious brother
[1:19:01] my precious brother said there was one
[1:19:05] young lady that come up calling my
[1:19:08] precious brother and put her arms around
[1:19:10] his neck and the angel s and said do you
[1:19:13] know who that is
[1:19:15] he said no brother I said she was
[1:19:18] beautiful said you know that said you
[1:19:21] let her to the Lord when she was 90
[1:19:23] years old
[1:19:27] it ain't going to be just the Prophet on
[1:19:30] that day it ain't going to be you some
[1:19:32] preachers but those of you that have
[1:19:35] went and testified about Jesus Christ
[1:19:39] just like Philip did to Nathanael come
[1:19:43] and see come and see that the Lord is
[1:19:48] God come and see that he's still alive
[1:19:53] I know there's many of you sitting here
[1:19:59] to say yeah I come because this one or
[1:20:01] that one witness to me
[1:20:11] years ago when I was just young boy I
[1:20:13] felt out my heart to go out and visit
[1:20:16] people around here and I went out and
[1:20:18] visited all I could why to give people
[1:20:26] to come hallelujah and on that day
[1:20:31] there's going to be a shout and fire
[1:20:35] they'll say because of you cause your
[1:20:39] faith thank you for that
[1:20:44] there's prayers you pray for people and
[1:20:49] I'll tell you what I've lived long
[1:20:52] enough in this life to know different
[1:20:55] ones who prayed for me that I've had
[1:20:56] opportunity to say thank you for praying
[1:20:58] for me I can remember a time my life and
[1:21:03] I was running from God and I tell people
[1:21:06] don't pray for me I didn't think I
[1:21:13] wanted to pray for me but they prayed
[1:21:14] for me anyhow and you know what that's
[1:21:18] why I'm here today you love the Lord
[1:21:26] this morning I know it's just a simple
[1:21:30] message is on my heart but I wanted to
[1:21:33] share it with you and I hope it's helped
[1:21:37] you Amen god bless you as a company
[1:21:40] a man
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:36] and it becomes when he gets a hold of it
[1:22:39] becomes so applicable
[1:22:45] this is the result of a token life it
[1:22:50] brings it down to an application
[1:22:54] what a responsibility the Lord has
[1:22:57] charged every one of us with I'd say in
[1:23:01] my heart I speak for myself Lord I want
[1:23:05] to renew where I've been slacking I want
[1:23:11] to pick it up
[1:23:13] pick it up
[1:23:16] thankful to God for Amazing Grace but I
[1:23:19] think of how that the Lord let it right
[1:23:21] down through that message today all
[1:23:23] those other parts are so important that
[1:23:27] allows Amazing Grace to step in you know
[1:23:31] as many things in the scriptures where
[1:23:32] God admonishes us to do this to do this
[1:23:35] to do this to do that and then he steps
[1:23:38] in and he does what we cannot do and
[1:23:41] even in what he asked us to do it's him
[1:23:44] that equips us to have the faith to even
[1:23:47] do that and then it's all Amazing Grace
[1:23:51] but in every and everything when we look
[1:23:54] at it I thought about it just as the
[1:23:56] jury was speaking there and you know one
[1:23:58] of the things you can always tell when
[1:24:00] the Spirit of God is writing a service
[1:24:02] because not just to what you feel but
[1:24:06] it's how that the sod will take you
[1:24:08] right down through the word and there'll
[1:24:09] be things that start starting to connect
[1:24:11] and come together all the way across
[1:24:14] things you've been reading you've been
[1:24:15] hearing it all comes across and you'll
[1:24:18] find yourself here while what's being
[1:24:19] spoken but yet the Holy Spirit is doing
[1:24:22] just what he said he would do he said
[1:24:24] I'll bring every those things to your
[1:24:25] remembrance whatsoever I've said so you
[1:24:28] see sometimes that when you're listening
[1:24:30] to the word you're reading the word
[1:24:31] sometimes it seems like it don't seem
[1:24:34] like both semia I'm getting anything but
[1:24:36] remember before you have a fire you've
[1:24:38] got to get wood
[1:24:40] is that right in many times it's the
[1:24:43] mechanics of the word don't ever display
[1:24:46] that the mechanics are important because
[1:24:48] without mechanics dynamics cannot come
[1:24:51] and light it up even when Elijah when he
[1:24:54] was putting all those things in order it
[1:24:55] was all with a purpose that the fire was
[1:24:58] going to fall God knows exactly what
[1:25:00] he's doing
[1:25:00] think of the message and humble thyself
[1:25:02] a small little message but brother
[1:25:04] Brennan reiterates within that message
[1:25:06] in the first part of it
[1:25:07] then brother Vail speaks in the middle
[1:25:09] of it and brother Branham comes right
[1:25:10] back along and brother Graham comes
[1:25:12] right back to that place he said we all
[1:25:14] want to see that third Pole work among
[1:25:16] us he said but it will take every one of
[1:25:18] us in position so it's like a great
[1:25:21] watch every little thing timing together
[1:25:24] perfectly and the Lord knows that I tell
[1:25:26] you just I'm not trying to add anything
[1:25:28] to it it just is so wonderful how God
[1:25:31] has made known to us this morning not
[1:25:34] only our responsibility but his grace
[1:25:36] stepping in in our lives amen and I
[1:25:39] believe that I believe that I love that
[1:25:42] part where Lent
[1:25:43] where the lowering right down through
[1:25:44] the roof they didn't they didn't have to
[1:25:45] open up a roof and say oh he's over here
[1:25:47] let's go over here God knew how to
[1:25:49] direct a ride to the right spot I'll
[1:25:54] tell you friends over and over desert an
[1:25:55] overwhelming to recognize Lord you've
[1:25:58] got all things orchestrating it calls
