for what God has done sister Betsy and he'll continue to do a man and we are just we are very very privileged people in this hour that our eyes have been open I I don't sometimes I don't feel like I have enough words to say it sometimes I just be honest with you I don't feel like thank you is enough but you know what we could say thank you from here all all day long but this is where he wants to say thank you life that lives out thank you lord thank you Lord to where when he deals with our hearts our hearts said yes Lord forgive me Lord we turn to that Thank You Lord let's thank you lord thank you lord oh my what Grace has swept over our lives hallelujah don't you love him this morning amen so good to be in the house of the Lord with brothers and sisters of like precious faith amen we certainly appreciate the liberty of the Holy Ghost amen we want to hear we want to go right into the word and as you're standing I just want to remind you there was an email sent out at the beginning of the week just with some details and points of the upcoming meetings in Memorial Day and if you didn't get a chance to read that or for some reason you don't have that please see you can even see my sister Michelle she can get that printed off for you so that you would have that or someone else can can maybe print it off for you it just has just details on there that would be good as well as the menu for the the dinner is is out there and if you'd like to sign up that would be good to do that those things have already are placed out there so let's get into the word you're hungry this morning mark 16 verse 1 we're just going to read a few verses of Scripture and verse 1 of mark 16 I'm just gonna read just just two verses of Scripture and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salman had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun may God bless His Word and bless you as you're being seated I want to just if the Lord will help us here and we'll just see where we are able to get to but I want to speak on a thought here we were dealing with some things last week and some things when you leave away sometimes you know it's never sometimes as a minister you feel well you feel you've made a complete mess of everything and you think the Lord the inspiration that you gave I you know it's almost I'm sorry you know and yet some of those times when it's been in that manner you know those are the times when you get the text and the emails and yeah God does that you know to let us know it's not us not that we ever think that it's us but sometimes there's things that when we're looking at we want the desire that that we have within it is there would be such a clarity of the word that is given and not just not just a letter but then you see when you understand your position and you understand what belongs to you and what you have then you know the rights that you have to request from God so we we don't want it just to be of where it is something that's just spoken but we want to be active upon the word when God has spoken we want to recognize that's God letting us know what belongs to us and sometimes it's things that is very good for things to be rehearsed and refreshed and I'll say it like this there are things as we go through the word you come into it and I just said you know just like in this hour there's things that I am seeing that I never saw before and yet I go back and look at some of my books looking notes and whatever more and in my Bible where I wrote notes and I said well sure I seen it but you know you've never seen it in the light that it's in and right now God does everything in a season and you know that's the thing that to me it just gives you such joy because the word itself the word when the life giver of the word Himself is present the word never becomes stagnant it's not a broken sister and it becomes a living fountain of water and then we recognize it is that fountain for us right now that's open in the house of David it's that which is bringing cleansing and healing and and and and and moving in our lives so we want to look at this here a little bit more this morning and I want to just kind of take take a little bit of time and going through some of these things on when when we look at these scriptures here in regards to this of the resurrection you know many people around this time of the year it is something that is no more than just a historical event but we as the people of God and I want you just to you know you might set here this morning and let me go ahead and and put this out here you might set here this morning and all of these parts and these different things you might walk out and say I just don't seem like I understand all the parts what is important that you would gather and recognize is who is in our midst who's speaking to your hearts and to recognize that he's not a historical God many can read this book fall in love with this book and yet still not recognize it to be a prophetic book the Pharisees and the Sadducees all of them remember they knew they knew they knew the law they knew the writings of the prophets they could finish quotes you understand now they knew this but all they knew is that of the latter they did not even when they were reading the word listen to me now they when they were reading the word and poring over it it was not something that where it was in a manner of saying Lord what I've read I seem to understand but Lord will you give the understanding that is trap that is hidden within here sealed within it you see if it would have just proach tit with humility its in faith because see faith remember the Bible says that the righteousness of God is revealed from faith unto faith and the Scriptures tell us that when he came they themselves did not obtain the righteousness of God this righteousness of God had nothing to do with all the ceremonialism that they could put on on the outside where brother Bram says you could not put a finger on their life I wonder if we were looking at them and this is what we think makes a fine church and we say well this is the I mean you can't put a finger here you can't put a finger here that's not what God's after he's after humble hearts the world and everything else might be able to put fingers but God's after humble hearts that are able to submit themselves think of the scripture that he said in that day he said father I think that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent did you catch what he said there he didn't say from those who are ignorant from those who were dumb from those no it's from those who are wise and prudent even of lives that you could esteemed but yet he hid himself from all of that and here is the part brother branham will continue by the unction of the Spirit of God to put that forth but revealed it unto babes such as would learn we want to grow in the grace of God but we never want to grow beyond simplicity never the word itself the revelation when revelation breaks forth on our lives it is something that makes you and I aware of it is not me it's not my efforts it's not my doings not it isn't that we don't give ourselves to prayer it isn't that we don't give ourselves to the Lord but we recognize it's simply God himself as he would move and we give ourselves to him it's it's just like you know when a song is being played you have got to be able to give yourself to enter it you may not understand the words you may when a new song is introduced you may not even understand the flow of the melody but you give yourself to try to learn it and as you're learning it some of the things are off some of the things are on your Paul's to the next bar the next phrase the next you know and but yet within it what it is you're giving yourself that's what the Holy Spirit comes to do is that he would draw us that we would give ourselves not withhold ourselves because down through the ages he has put churches away in divorce good people put him away in divorce because they failed to receive further multiplication of the word of life that's why it's very important in this hour that we there is that life that is pulsating and moving within us so when we look at this as we come back into this the scripture that's laying here we has believers and I would say not just now in this hour but every hour when that Easter time would approach there was something about the believers that was special in the hour that they were living because you see Easter to a believer is not just a memorial it is a living reality every day of our life it's not just a new outfit we wear on Easter but we have been changed and a new garment we have adorned by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what Easter is really about and Satan's mockery is a new hat and a new this but you see who has as that of the wife of Almighty God we are adorned by being in subjection to the word hallelujah he is our bonnet of power hallelujah amen as the Bible said that the women it says in the scripture ought to have long hair is that right the nature itself teaches us these things Paul laid this out in the word but what does it say she ought to have power on her head because of the angels what angels are we talking about the messengers to the Church of the Living God you see God provides the clothing and attire that's needed for us as the ester in this hour to walk in before him he provides it by his own life by his own substance so it's not something we put on on Easter morning and come to church but it is a life you see this is why I think brother random said they talked about putting a new coat on the man Levin said you don't need a new coat on the man you need to put a new man in the coat and that's what God does he takes and he puts a new man on the inside of the same old temple glory be to God somebody can say I remember this and I remember that you got the wrong address there used to be somebody lived here that sounds like what you're talking about but I want to let you know he don't live here no more and not only that new owner has arrived [Music] glory be to God whoo hallelujah it's a living reality of what the resurrection means to us especially on the sin especially in the hour that you and I are living in of what was there fulfilled in the life of the Lord Jesus here's a came in the Ministry of the son of man and then as he gave his life he gave his life because there had to be a price that was paid right if something's in the pawnshop and you let your phone go back you can't just walk into the pawnshop and say give me my phone back they are going to ask you and say what do you have the money for this you can't just walk in and take it there's got to be the price rendered to purchase what is in that pawnshop and when that price is rendered then you have authority to say release it let it go it belongs to me release it what because the price has been paid and that's what you and I have the right this morning as sons and daughters of God we're not waiting on a price to be paid we're not waiting on another promise we're not waiting on something else we recognize here that the living Lord Jesus makes you and I wear that every redemptive blessing belongs to you as the sons and daughters of God hallelujah that's what this resurrection means for you and I it is something that is wrote there that I think of where that people down through here covering the time of even last week and everything that has taken place and it was little more than just an Easter Sunday y'all got rich with me it was no more than just an Easter Sunday but you see it's something that is beyond that that we recognize not only did he get up but you see this is where the question has to be asked and answered what does that have to do with me why did he get up why did he die and then why did he get up what does that have to do with me you see that same life that brought the Lord Jesus out of the grave that raised him up triumphantly he stood there triumphant over grass over the grave death and hail he stood triumphant you realize men had went to the grave and the grave had held him there had been men that were waiting in paradise there had been those who were there in Hell come on cuz hell is just a holding place come on there's no such thing as an eternal hell right God he must give you a fair trial before sending them to the lake of fire hell is no more than just like the local jail and when I say no more it's a lot worse but you understand it's worse even than the one that they talk about in the other County some of y'all get that don't you it's all over our local or local headlines and stuff but I'm Johnny it's a holding place it's a place that you don't want to go to it was a place that the Prophet when he was there in Hale he saw women with paint on their face you know what pain is assemble up there hiding something come on somebody you ever seen them when their face is washed come on now I work for somebody one time I've been even recognize them when they came in they had all that eyeliner and everything else washed off their face and I stood there and looked at you no I don't wanna be standing nobody so I turn around that cat is that her but aren't you glad listen now I'm not gonna dwell on this this morning but aren't you glad you see God don't want you to put nothing on I hope you understand what I'm talking about it's even much deeper than paint God don't want you to put on religion religion is a covering he rejected in Eden when they made themselves skins and got rejected that's called religion God does not desire that he said I will be your covering when Ruth was laying in humility at his feet he said take my covering and put it on you hallelujah you're cold cover up with my covering he takes away coldness lukewarmness indifference you see the power of the covering of the life of this bad it removes all of those things we are warmed in the presence of the Living God hallelujah he rolls on that Easter morning and you see he arose and I wanted to say like this he arose in resurrection power it was power they didn't go down there and dig up the graves are you with me nobody had to go down there he didn't need help rolling away the stone you know what it shows no matter how bad that and how much the Satan would think he has a life him then hedged in and sealed up but when Jesus comes by when resurrection power comes by brother bearing enough seals bearing enough town bearing enough unbelief bearing enough anything to keep him back from his word and you are his word he comes to fulfill his word and you are his word hallelujah [Applause] when he rose it brought forth the word that had been sown in their hearts the Bible says in 2nd Corinthians 13:4 for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God you see this is the secret of the new birth you got to become weak you got to be willing to die to yourself well I try to be up no don't try to be nothing die for we also are weak oh my we are also weaken him but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you how are you living this morning by the power of God how am i living this morning by the power of God let's just be honest right now there are certain days you don't feel like putting one foot in front of the other but it's the power of God moving in your life I'm not talking about your feelings many days there's days that we can go by and we do not feel like Christians we don't feel like we got power but remember it's not a power that resides in this or in our spirit it is the power of God that resides in our whole so we don't have to try to do right we don't have to try to live right that is part of who we are that the power of God has released oh what a resurrection this is we are weak in him you see this is why it's good you get around one another and you fellowship the young people sometimes you know they get to see us there huh well they don't they you know they don't eat donuts with the Angels I'm in day you know bill Sam you don't get up and drink and you know coffee with the angel but the joy only comes they recognize the understand them say they recognize it's not us that's living hallelujah oh my verse 5 examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobates see it's not enough to believe on him you must be in him and the question would be how do I get in here there's one way there's one way and there ain't nobody no preacher can take you there but he himself is the only one that can bring you there because he is the shepherd he is the door of the sheepfold come on somebody he is the gate and he himself is the quicken ER that lifts you by His resurrection power [Music] I appreciate good morality but I'm talking things deeper than just good clean living I'm talking about a power that raises you up that which puts in our hearts the simplicity and the humility and the faith to simply believe because he said so hallelujah glory be to God I'll tell you what I feel like another language here verse 10 of Romans 8 and if Christ be in you in you the body is dead because of sin you see the body becomes as dead it's like this code is I can take this coat I can throw it around this coat I can do with it what I will to do with it I can put it on and I can take it off right that's that's what the body becomes because this body was brought forth under that first nature it has all that stickiness and carnality and everything about it that's why there's got to come a greater power on the inside then you have power over this and the body becomes dead the body says hold this and the inner man says shut up come on somebody you know this is why the Bible says in Romans 6 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies thoughts of doubt and unbelief and criticism and everything else cast that out that is not the Holy Ghost [Applause] if you dwell on and it'll wilt power over your life it'll take you from the presence of God even while you're setting under the presence of God it will become a blockade in an isolation between you and the power of God but let me tell you something you've got to write this morning and there is one present to equip you as the son and daughter of God to discern that devil and cast him down [Applause] sometimes people dwell on things think on things talk on things that the hell got no business doing the Bible's clear you don't think on anything that ain't got virtue in it it don't have praise in it come on somebody you don't you cast it out but say no I believe in casting out Devils there you go cast him out come on somebody cast him out he comes to you and present something cast him out the bible says casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the Lord Jesus Christ every high thing sometimes there's high things that shows you certain points he took Jesus up to a high mountain come on he took him up to the pinnacle he took him up to height and he showed him the heights of this nation the heights of Germany the heights of this he showed him all the high points but he didn't show him Skid Row he didn't show him everything else of the debauchery that is brought from that he only showed him the heights Satan took all that and spliced it all together and presented this this will I give you let me tell you something anything that Satan gives you and it's a lure with your eyes it is full of death behind it he's a liar and everything he presents is a lie glory be to God wouldn't recognize that spirit and withstand it no it would be to God the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you here's the here's the hokey if the spirit that raised up Jesus guerrillas here was that body laying in the ground but it took the Spirit of God to come down and raise that body up don't let this stuff you the Spirit of God that was the Lord Jesus he had to come and raise up his own body you see this is where the mystery of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost it comes and makes real to you and I that it is an equipping of that life that he already sold in you and I in the beginning and when the quickening power is come upon that word that has been so there it raises in power and then you have authority by resurrection power over your body your body can say I don't feel like it I don't this and I don't that and sometimes we succumb to it it's amen sometimes things we talk about and say about and shadow Grizzles doing it hello this forgive me Lord but you see quickening power resurrection power will not allow you to stay or remain in that state why because you have true light shining in you [Applause] and you can't stay in that condition even when gloom and darkness tries to swirl around but there's light in Goshen [Music] hallelujah there's right on the inside there's light that says I will make it I will get through this glory be to God but at the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you glory be to God it brings in subjection now I want to look here in the scripture here just a moment in Leviticus 23 verse 19 your God is letting the people know when you come into the land this is what I want you to do in verse nine the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the Lord spoke unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and sand to them when ye be come into the land which I give unto you we could preach on that this land belongs to you you have to have faith that it belongs to you he said I've already given it to you for there's Devils we gotta fight on this land but you by faith can say get off my land get off my land and you're not gonna go I've got brothers and sisters with me you might be thousands but we're coming for your head come on somebody we're coming we're coming after what belongs to us glory be to God this is where brother Brent says once you get into the land your prayer life changes you see how does it change you're no longer praying as though you're the tail you pray and recognize and the head not pray for me I'll be able to hang on pray for me no you pray in a man and say this is my promise this belongs to me as a believer you say in that being a little boat he wants you to call him on the scene that he will come and then the capias word to you in you and through you when you be coming to the land that I give you they hadn't even set a foot on it but God said it's yours hallelujah and let me tell you something there is a report and it's a good report Amen a report that has been brought by the Lord Himself hey man he was the life giver of that land hallelujah when you become into the land you see when the resurrection took place Jesus lived in a land when he was here he lived in the land of the Holy Ghost he walked in the world a perfect faith he was living in that land right I'm in the world but I'm not of the world he said the son of man here he is on earth yet he's in heaven he was walking in two worlds at one time he was walking in this land while living from that land when he came into that land how did he come into that land when he walked to the River Jordan as the sacrifice here came the Holy Ghost the pillar fire descending in the form of a dove and what did it do it took the word that was already there and made it fresh in quickened the promise to him and revealed who God was in that hour and when that revelation came in him it was reflected through him and God was letting it be known I will pour on my spirits my spirit and it will abide not just pouring out the spirit and it just fluttering away but the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true new birth is where the Holy Ghost comes to abide not just somebody who shows up to the house every once in a while but somebody who says this is my house this is my house and Jesus was living in that land it was a good report who hath believed our report Isaiah 53 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed God extending his life his promise he was living in that land and walking in this land who no repeat of God whooo I just mean many need to have a praise break here myself [Laughter] [Applause] glory glory when you come into the land you see coming into that land now you see he was announcing to them by the coming of the Messiah his life listen to me now his life was an announcement that life is here and life is going to come to you right my life remember as he continued to pour out and he spoke himself over and over because I live you live also right the works that I do shall you do also greater than this because I go to my father right he continually pointed and he said I'm come that you might have life it wasn't Matthew that they weren't already breathing they were walking around eating but that ain't life that's just one form of life walking around and eating and sleeping and working but he said I come that you might have life and might have been more abundantly you see he just did not want to himself come and be a blessing he did not just want to come and be a blessing but he came to share the blessing that blessing of Abraham the pouring out of the Holy Ghost on the royal seed of Abraham hallelujah he came to pour that blessing out when you come into the land you see he had to bring him into the land when the resurrection took place hoggle fishing things ain't happen the way I thought it was gonna happen and things aren't going the way it should go and I don't think and you know what they begin to go about their own way why they were sheep just like you and I we fail the moment we try to depend on ourselves we're brother saying I know the Word of God I know the message you can still fail a sheep is to be led and we're led by the unction of the Holy Ghost come on church we're not led by letters I don't see this what the Spirit of God is leading you to do it ought to be demonstrated it ought to be this word being vindicated in your life and if you're telling me you're led to do something that's not vindicated here I'm telling you it's a devil it's a lying spirit but we want to raise its head against the word God ain't interested in our feelings our opinions our thought he's only come to vindicate his words when you come into this land he had to bring them to this land did he do it sure he did he began to appear and make himself known to him there right like some of that we've been through last week but then as he began to he gathered him together and when he got him together the Bible says he believed on him and he said receive ye the Holy Ghost you know what he was letting them know that you were going to be born of the breath of God and what is the breath of God that's the divine inspiration that would move their that same Holy Ghost that moved upon the prophets and now the Bible says that they were moved by by the Holy Ghost is that right they did not speak what they wanted to speak they were so caught up and lived in that word till they spoke in line with that word Oh glory be to God when all persecution of Salem yet they had food and do Caesar they were strengthened they were nourished they had joy they had what they had need of to endure and reflect Christ in that time and he came and he made known the land to him how is he going to come amen he had to get him standing on their feet they had that flesh put on and dry bones had to be come to come together come on somebody and flesh begin to come on sinew all of those things coming in order let me tell you something your life in my life was out of order but I don't care how hard you try or how hard you're trying right now this morning you can never put your life together but there's only one that can put you together and that's the one who made you who knows all about you a church can't put you together mom and daddy can't put you together but the Holy Ghost is able to put you together and put you back in the place in Christ in its taking where you were all along what a resurrection this is when you become into this land I said when you become into this land but I have given you I'll see you in the name of Jesus Christ if you don't have the Holy Ghost you can claim right now that promise and say Lord deliverance is mine you can claim that promise right now the Holy Ghost belongs to me let me tell you something that in two words of a man that's warming your soul daddy is the presence of the angel of the Lord it is Christ Himself the angel of the Lord that's warming your soul and your life what's he doing he's warming you up maybe you've been a church member a church life but he's here to warm you up [Applause] and he's breathing on you when I come to this church for a long time I know the message you ever get this win then Satan's can never put that out though this is one birthday [Music] this is one birthday it brings us back to the original very no blowing out this light it's not a man-made light but it is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself that same pillar fire that comes down and he lives the children of God with his presence with this person when you become into this land you see you've got to be brought in contact with this land can you imagine if you never came in contact with this land you wouldn't know anything about it but it's more than just hearing about it you got us know that this land is real it's not enough to know about this land it's like I told a person I said you know when brother Ella and then would come over here they told me brother Joey I've seen pictures on my dad with the Philippines i watch pictures and when brother Roel and sister Cindy over in the Philippines he showed me and you both he showed us their own pictures of being in the Philippines that's all I had was a picture but when I got off the plane that morning in October it wasn't a picture no more I had all of the smells all the sounds everything around me that was buzzing you know what I had experienced it in reality it was no longer a picture let me tell you something too pillar 5 and just to be a picture come on somebody the pillar fire is the living person of the Lord Jesus Christ it's representative of this person and of his presence and he comes to set lives on fire [Applause] he don't need to pour gasoline on you there's already gasoline that's trapped there in that seat and when the pillar fire comes upon it it manifests it's not water it's gas high-octane combustible gas and in this hour it's not horse and buggy power it's not automobile power it's not airplane power this is astronaut power that's why the life that we live now it reflects the power of the world that has been released to you and I thank God for what Luther has thank God for what Wesley had thank God for what pinnacle said but remember we have received power that is an overcoming power that it lives above all of the sand flesh world in the devil and brings us into alignment with God's desire for this hour when you become into the land Lord I don't know if I'm gonna get off this verse or not when you become into the land this is why we want our children brought where the lands apt we want our children we want our grandchildren we want our homes our families to be brought where that land is preached come on friends we don't want to stand there and say well I'll tell you what it out there ain't no way they can live it a very no way you can live it I don't care how long you been around I don't care how much you know if that's what you're resting on you better check up you better make sure that Christ is in you because it's not you that's living that's got to be a living reality but it's Christ in you not Christ in your pastor not Christ in the prophet not Christ in mom and dad er her brother and sister so and so but Christ in you when you become into this land now remember there were some folks that got brought up to this land they came up to it and they rejected it is that right the Bible says in the book of Corinthians he appeared to 500 120 went in hello somebody 120 went in is that right here he came over into this place right here they come up to the land and when they come up to the land there was those of 10 spies that said this is too much for us it's too big for us there ain't no way in the world we can take these giants but Joshua and Caleb were not looking at the Giants what they were looking at if the Lord be with us let me tell you something that's what's the most important thing is if God be for us who can be against us if the Lord be with us then they will be bread for us that's the most comforting words that he can give us I am with me I am with thee let me tell you something even when you didn't know he was with you he was with you the first time he talked to Gideon he said that mighty man of Valor the Lord is with thee if we can put it like this he wasn't even born again yet but you see it was the Lord that had been with him the Lord had watched over his life and the Lord is the one who had even stirred up that desire if God be for us where be all his miracles and a person can say in this hour well we don't need miracles we've got the word how in the world do you separate the two if you can separate the two then you've got a taint that we don't know if it's gas or what it is but I'll give you this statement here out of junction of time brother man said one Noah he said was himself preparing a miracle he was preparing for a miracle and he said you give me a church that is exercised to believe in miracles and the supernatural he said I'll show you a church that the rapture will not be a hard thing for because not only are we miracles we are preparing for a miracle [Applause] we don't need miracles you speak for yourself but when I see a miracle being done I see him it's something I need this to be vindicated it's just that I love him I'm gonna say me we don't need all those things anymore I'm afraid that's that same organizational spirit that put him out the revelation of this message it never went it's truly revealed it does not put out any of his gifts this message by the angel of the Lord it puts all those gifts in order and in its place and every gift when it's positionally place it declares him to be the same what were the ministerial gifts given for they were given in that procession as though an one who was a mighty Conqueror would scatter those gifts out what were the scattering of those gifts those gifts were the scattering because he had rose triumphant over death hell and the grave and I don't care what gift it is that it would be using that gift itself it must stand there and declare that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's not a gift that makes a pact with the devil come on somebody you need to stop sending ambassadors to try to make a peace plan you need to recognize that whole land belongs to you I'm givin the West Bank I ain't givin the east bank I want my boundaries hello you when you become into the land and shall reap the harvest thereof so I want you to catch this when you come into the land you shall reap the harvest thereof when they came over into the land there the Bible says when they got in the land in the Book of Joshua the manna ceased on the morrow and they ate of the old corn of the land what were they eating up if it was old corn that they were eating it showed that there had been corn that went in the ground it had come through the full maturity and now it was ready to be eaten it was ready for them when they got there when you become into the land and reap the harvest there up so as you're coming into the land here was the Lord Jesus receive ye the Holy Ghost he was announcing there it's time for you to come into the land that I have given to you no wonder they could return and go up there to the Upper Room of joy the Bible said they had joy before they got the Holy Ghost that's why when you see people without joy huh they went up there with joy before they ever got the holy ghost but you see when they come in the land you see what was it there had been a harvest his life the Son of Man his life that ministry had come to full fruition and now it was time to take that wave sheaf up I'm gonna borrow this this is a poor thing for a wave see but it'll do sorry sister Michelle you can fix this later but when they came into the land I'm talking my wheat now you're alright y'all with me come on now y'all can imagine this right you as me Braden you got to use your imagination man as a young young boy you got you with me we come into the land and when they came into the land when they got there this harvest was waiting on them when they got in the land you won the shoot it wasn't a tassel you with me it wasn't green it had come up and it wasn't it didn't just have seeds with him the shuck there and it was still green but when they came in the land it was golden golden what pillar deity power it was golden and when you become in the land and you reap the harvest they're up you see they knew what belonged to them and said this harvest belongs to me and when you take that harvest and it's waived as accepted unto the Lord you know what that meant it meant that the field that this came out of there's more in the field that are gonna look just like this and come to this same power this same image this same glory go Robina God in the highest and as this wave she you know what it was it was life think about this brother Drake think about it for a moment before this ever came up like this remember a wheat plant starts from a seat is that right it starts from a seed but then that seed grows to maturity and when it comes up it's a testimony of life that the same life the same maturity the rest of this field will actually be the same kind same power same image same glory but here it is the Ministry of the Son of Man Christ in his fullness right he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily not just horse-and-buggy power not just car power not just airplane power astronaut power not just justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost but the person of Christ himself be Son of Man V word Luther was a part of the word Wesley was a part of the word Pentecost was a part of the word when you get all the parts together when you get all the loose parts together when all the loose ends come together it is the word now standing in our midst who is the son of man and the son of man he was not waved over Caiaphas's he was not waived there upon the rest of him but brother branham makes it clear in the rising of the Sun he said he was waved to them so he comes and he waves himself over his children he waves his life over his children that's what this resurrection means for you and I as the son of man was waved over them on the day of Pentecost and it came out a pure undefiled bride in a bride age that was reflecting the ministry of the son of man and the devil tried to sniff that life for health but remember that life cannot be defeated hell already tried to conquer it Rome lost one time and Rome lost again positrons and power it rose in a little green suit where the just shall live by faith when that first angel went to preach the everlasting gospel it rose up you say there's only a little green thing let me tell you something don't you ever despise the day of small things in your life it might be a little shoot coming out in your life right now but don't despise the day of small things know that the same God that brings the shoot will bring it to full maturity and there's not enough Devils can stop it there's not enough demons that can stop it hallelujah because I live ye shall live also hallelujah he was waved over the people that same ministry in this hour has come and is waved back over the people remember God remembers we looked at it last week I just had this Moodle removed ahead remember as we looked at it last week that little ego who was in that barnyard he could not he could not respond to just let her preaching about an eagle you know why because even though it was just you know you're an eagle you're a neighbor just let her there wasn't no behind it Jesus everyone know behind it I know some people don't want that that's emotion you just misplace in quotes now we don't need intellectual Giants we need the power of God I said we need a resurrection power right here not only standing before you but sending these pews our lives that intellectualism could have never brought forth this reality it took the power of a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ to raise you out of darkness that you were in to raise you out of the trap of sin and unbelief and doubt and break the holds on your life it took Jesus Christ himself to be waved over your life and when he when he is waved over your life then you see a living image God had an eagle in this hour come on so body he had a promise in his word in the evening time there shall be light amen there was an eagle there were eyes upon the air that can catch the light that was shining they can catch that line that it was shining and what did it do it has LED light into the party what is it that has brought light into you your eyes have been anointed by the Holy Spirit and then life has come in you no longer I who live but Christ liveth in me reign over the people and like little Eagles we look up and say we're not seeing the mechanics we're seeing the dynamic power or you see brother Graham no no I'm seeing I'm seeing the eagle that that's right inside there now I'm not just saying run round I'm not an idolaters I'm not an image worshipper I'm an eagle you're not going to trap me in that cage I'm not going in that cage Artie came out of that hateful an unclean foul cage I am NOT going back into that cage we are not worshipers a man we are worshipers of the Living God hallelujah it is him that is called our attention when we see this message we're not seeing a man we recognize it's the son of man that is rose in power and the dynamics have come upon the mechanics and to remember the eyes your eyes are outside your body if they were you'd look funny but your eyes are in your body is that right and your eyes that are on your body they're part of your body right the eyes that God has had in this hour is in the body that's why it's the son of man manifested in the body of the bride that same life is manifested in bride form not just a shoot not just a tassel not just a shot but the fullness of the wave she the fullness of the life and the power and the glory has returned no wonder the glory of the ladder house is greater hallelujah let's stand our feet hell alone [Applause] hallelujah give him glory all your people by his plan has washed away every stream hallelujah girl repeated God glory be to God we know who we are we know what we've been raised before the same life of the son of man living his life again that's the real kernel of the message is the life I'm not interested in debating kernels I just take the life that's in it you can argue about the kernel but it's about the life when that quickening power has passed upon your life the world is dead brother Graham said when that quickening power he said you're walking along you said in something just it strikes and you recognize it's a word it strikes he said immediately no more shorts no more this no more that no more why there is a ceasing because the Sun has aroused it's a new a new day no wonder Moses said in Exodus 12 today shall be unto you as the beginning of months that's what the new birth is it's a new beginning without ending brother Chris but the joy without ending because you were always saved you are always eternal but you just now recognized it and the power that had you caged in held in but there was a greater one that come that said that my people go that's more than coming to church in that's more than a church life that's Resurrection Life Church life will leave you in the same dead condition but when that resurrection comes it ain't a good feeling it raises you a newness of life you want witness and observe that life working in you and you can you stand in all yourself at the transformation because you know what is you yield to it the power just keeps spreading remember it says when you become in the land and when you get in the land occupied take over that land go take all that belongs to you if it seems too high for you pray pray until you ascend to that place believe it is for you amen this gift of the Holy Ghost this quickening power right here this morning it is unto you and to your children you got children it's not here right now you ought to say that belongs to me come on somebody hey listen what wasn't even Abraham's son he was just as nephew but Abraham said God gave me the land Lots part of this land I'm going to get it you got a link of a son and daughter you can claim this land I'm going after them by what sending the Holy Ghost the enforcer of the word hallelujah they might come back here and there's a half a tank of gas but that half a thinker guess is just a reminder of where God brought them from hallelujah you might have come back with a half tank of gas scars on your life but let me tell you something don't you let the devil try to put his finger and put them down you let that be a reminder of just how far he brought you from His grace is sufficient you cannot scape him and you can out running surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever this is for you this morning if you don't have it hallelujah I wonder this morning let's just have prayer amen we got eagles right here I'm talking to Eagles hey man why don't we just get together maybe brother to brother Sister 2 Sister or our husband and wife

the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that promise is hers most gracious Heavenly Father Lord we bring sister Betsy here and we always know that you already are with her and and we believe father that your promises are for us Lord and today as she comes walking in faith in an obedience to your word and as Peter said repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the
