[17:02] uh almost two about two weeks ago I was
[17:06] at the Bow
[17:08] Shoot and riding home with a brother to
[17:13] his house to stay that night I received
[17:16] a call from uh brother Jesus from per uh
[17:20] from New Jersey and he said brother I've
[17:24] been
[17:25] sharing all the testimonies with a
[17:28] brother brother
[17:30] that uh
[17:32] and
[17:33] uh he he he said if I if you could call
[17:37] him it was late at night so I called
[17:40] him and he was uh telling me that he had
[17:45] cancer and the prostate so bad that it
[17:48] had
[17:49] spread and he they gave him up and uh
[17:55] you know and so he while we're talking
[18:00] took about 2 hours um he says uh well if
[18:05] the Lord wants to take me he can take me
[18:08] if he doesn't want to take me he wants
[18:11] me to leave be here I'll be here
[18:14] whatever the Lord
[18:15] will
[18:17] and uh I'm not a person to
[18:21] pray that way you know you have to be
[18:26] determined am and
[18:29] make a decision whether you're going to
[18:31] believe or not so I just waited and
[18:35] waited
[18:36] and getting to the end I said Lord you
[18:39] know I'm over at the brother's house and
[18:42] they're ready to go to bed and but I
[18:45] don't want to rush things you know may
[18:48] your will be done but then all of a
[18:52] sudden on the
[18:55] phone he screams
[18:57] out pray for
[19:00] me I'm like shocked you know and he says
[19:06] will you please pray for me and I said
[19:10] Do you
[19:11] believe he said just
[19:13] now I believe he said I know God would
[19:17] do it I said well now we can pray you
[19:21] know I thought to myself now we can pray
[19:24] you know
[19:26] so prayed
[19:29] and
[19:31] uh uh this past
[19:34] Saturday while going to a
[19:38] meeting uh I receive a call and it's him
[19:42] and he says I just want to call you he

[19:49] says he went we went and took test on my
[19:53] PSI or I forget how what's it called PSA

[19:59] BSA and uh he
[20:03] says it's down to
[20:07] four and there's nothing that they can
[20:16] find and and and then he started crying
[20:20] and he says
[20:22] please tell everybody tell everybody
[20:25] that you
[20:26] know it's a miracle
[20:29] this is a miracle and I said I will I
[20:31] will share that so I just wanted to
[20:35] share that with you also want to share
[20:37] that a sister called
[20:40] me and she was really broken up
[20:44] crying and
[20:46] nervous she said Brother Ray will you
[20:49] please pray for me she says I've been
[20:52] going through a lot and I said sure
[20:54] we'll pray right now so we prayed
[20:59] by the end of the prayer you can hear
[21:01] her
[21:02] rejoicing you know because God God
[21:05] reached down and touched
[21:07] her and a minister brother called me and
[21:13] yesterday and asked me to
[21:15] pray because he didn't know what
[21:19] happened he he was on the writing lawn
[21:23] more and he went to go park it and he
[21:26] got up off of it
[21:29] and the next thing he found himself
[21:31] laying over the riding
[21:35] lawnmower
[21:36] and his wife was wondering where he's at
[21:41] and she went out and found him and he
[21:43] was laying across and she couldn't help
[21:45] him he's heavy and
[21:48] big uh but he says Brother Ray would you
[21:52] you
[21:53] know pray I said sure will so he called

[27:20] line cleared up everything's you know
[27:23] good to go so I leave work there's a lot
[27:26] of construction going on where my job
[27:28] was located actually the road is closed
[27:30] literally right at my job um so a lot of
[27:34] people don't think traffic is coming
[27:37] from that way and there's also many
[27:39] signs on that
[27:41] road so
[27:43] um I'm traveling on 13 going about 60 M
[27:47] an hour get to Mason Road the
[27:49] intersection
[27:50] there um I see the the woman she
[27:54] stopped and literally at the last second
[27:57] she start start pulling out and all I
[28:00] could think was like this is not
[28:01] happening um Lord help me and I just
[28:05] brace myself because there's no stopping
[28:07] going 60 miles an hour last minute and I
[28:10] didn't have my seat belt on um but thank
[28:14] the
[28:15] Lord seat belt or not airbags are not
[28:18] those didn't even deploy either he was
[28:20] with me through the whole accident um it
[28:24] was weird um just watching it happen
[28:28] like I I seen it all
[28:30] happen people a lot of people say oh you
[28:32] probably don't remember but I I do um
[28:35] maybe it's a good thing because I can be
[28:37] more grateful um but when it after it
[28:41] happened I was able to pull off the road
[28:44] and I remember just sitting there and
[28:45] all of a sudden fear just started
[28:48] speaking um everything like your car is
[28:51] total you just paid it off your car is
[28:52] total now you're going to have a car
[28:53] payment what are you going to do you're
[28:55] a single mom all kinds of um
[28:59] everything you can think of just started
[29:00] coming to my mind
[29:01] um what have you done to the Lord like
[29:04] you must have really ticked him off for
[29:05] all this to be happening to you it's
[29:06] been it's been a a week for you huh and
[29:09] then other things people said to me like
[29:12] um for instance I'm not going to call
[29:14] the names but you sure this is the right
[29:16] way you're going because all this bad
[29:18] happening to you you know maybe you need
[29:20] to give it up and try something else so
[29:22] I mean everything everything just
[29:24] started to come and but I'm like no
[29:28] get out the car so I get out the
[29:31] car um start walking around I look over
[29:33] I see all these buzzers on the tower and
[29:34] I've heard enough messages brother the
[29:36] Brandon preach ain't got nothing to say
[29:37] good about them buzzards so I'm like
[29:39] where you at Satan like I'm ready to
[29:41] fight Satan on the side of 13 you know
[29:43] for everything he's been putting me
[29:44] through um so tow truck comes gets my
[29:49] car out of there my neighbor comes she
[29:51] picks me up my adrenaline's high so I
[29:53] didn't take an ambulance but later on I
[29:55] I was feeling some sort of way so I went
[29:56] to the ER was a little sore you know
[29:59] obviously I got whiplash um they did
[30:01] scans on my uh my head my abdomen um my
[30:07] chest took x-rays on my arm everything
[30:09] came back
[30:10] fine um I did suffer a
[30:14] concussion um that got a little bit
[30:16] rough on Friday night but you know the
[30:17] Lord I was like Lord brought me through
[30:19] this accident alive he's going to get me
[30:20] through this concussion too so
[30:23] it's in the moment it was terrible but
[30:27] praise the Lord anyway through
[30:28] everything even through my trials right
[30:32] um so concussion what else happened
[30:36] thinking I don't have my brain freeze
[30:37] brain fog is still there a little bit um
[30:40] so I was off of work for a week so that
[30:42] was nice I got to just kind of stay home
[30:44] and relax and also um just meditate like
[30:47] I was telling brother Samuel the other
[30:49] day like I feel so exhausted um I
[30:52] couldn't you find myself to really like
[30:54] pray like how I thought you know I
[30:56] should be praying like speaking I just
[30:58] just sat outside and just you know just
[31:02] focused on the Lord and just had a time
[31:04] with him really stayed in the word and
[31:06] listen to messages
[31:08] um um then I had to go back to work
[31:12] yesterday
[31:14] um and it was a decent
[31:17] day everyone you know most people were
[31:20] concerned anyway so I got to give my
[31:22] testimony to a huge Factory I got to
[31:26] glorify my Lord
[31:28] and I'm not ashamed I don't care like I
[31:30] will tell like you're going to sit there
[31:32] if you're going to ask me how I am what
[31:33] happened you're going to hear about my
[31:35] Jesus okay you're going to know it was
[31:37] him and him alone and I'm so grateful
[31:41] and everyone will know that but then
[31:43] today came and I get pulled into the
[31:46] office more
[31:48] chatter so um just the devil trying to
[31:52] get at me again you know I'm like you're
[31:53] too late dude like you know too late so
[31:57] but yeah people still trying to destroy
[32:00] me but I'm still listening to that
[32:01] series down in Destroy so you know God
[32:05] God's got me covered he's got me covered
[32:07] and everything's going to be all right I
[32:09] don't care like like I said
[32:11] Satan okay I was out for a very long
[32:14] time I'm done with that he done had his
[32:18] chance it's over I'm the Lord's full of
[32:21] the Holy Ghost and there's nothing he
[32:23] can do to shake my
[32:25] faith I'm right here I know where I
[32:27] stand the Lord and I no but I do want to
[32:30] read a few
[32:32] scriptures that I came
[32:36] across want to read
[32:39] them
[32:44] sorry I want you to listen up too Satan
[32:48] so we are pressured in every way hedged
[32:51] in but not crushed perplexed unsure of
[32:53] finding a way out but not driven to
[32:56] despair hunted down Anderson persecuted
[32:58] but not deserted to stand alone struck
[33:01] down but never
[33:06] destroyed and we know with great
[33:09] confidence that God who is deeply
[33:10] concerned about us causes all things to
[33:12] work together as a plan for good for
[33:14] those who love God to those who are
[33:16] called according to his plan and and
[33:20] purpose so who shall ever separate us
[33:23] from the love of Christ will tribulation
[33:25] or distress or persecution or famine or
[33:27] nakedness or danger or sword just as it
[33:30] is written and forever remains written
[33:31] for your sake we are put to death all
[33:33] day long we are regarded as sheep for
[33:35] the slaughter yet in all these things we
[33:37] are more than conquerors and gain an
[33:39] overwhelming Victory through him who
[33:40] loved us so much that he died for us I
[33:42] am convinced and continue to be
[33:44] convinced Beyond any doubt that neither
[33:46] death nor life nor angels nor
[33:47] principalities nor things present and
[33:49] threatening nor things to come nor
[33:51] powers nor height nor depth nor any
[33:52] other created thing will be able to
[33:54] separate us from the unlimited love of
[33:56] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[33:58] So What then shall we say to these
[33:59] things if God be for us who can be
[34:02] against us God bless you
[34:07] all
[34:10] than give God glory hallelujah amen how

[40:35] Rock they would write in the scriptures
[40:37] David would speak of
[40:40] it there is no Rock like our
[40:44] Rock I think about
[40:47] the gentleman that went on the field
[40:50] there after the battle was over they had
[40:52] put mustard gas everywhere and killed
[40:55] everything and he said he was drawn to
[40:58] go over and
[40:59] look underneath a rock and he lifted up
[41:02] that rock and there was growing a little
[41:06] flower
[41:10] hallelu you know to me those aren't just
[41:12] stories that are included in the
[41:16] message CU there's times where we have
[41:18] felt like in our lives where mustard gas
[41:21] has been all over
[41:23] us
[41:24] yes oh yes but aren't you glad that our
[41:28] lives are hidden with God in
[41:33] Christ there's a place that place of
[41:36] safety that place that we can let off
[41:38] the pressure that place in the midst
[41:41] of the age in the time that we're living
[41:44] in listen even the the chaos that we see
[41:47] out there listen this is where brother
[41:50] Bram said he said I believe I've come to
[41:52] this
[41:53] place just as the Lord Jesus was on the
[41:56] cross and said father forgive them for
[41:58] they know not what they do he said
[42:01] that's what's taking place it's Spirits
[42:04] that's driving the people they don't
[42:06] know what they're
[42:08] doing and how thankful we ought to be
[42:11] for God's grace cuz at one time we we
[42:14] were driven that's right by those
[42:16] Spirits we were under those influence we
[42:18] were under one influence of one Spirit
[42:20] or another it's but God in his Mercy
[42:24] that that's what it was May God help us
[42:26] let that never Escape our hearts it was
[42:28] the mercy of God that reached down for
[42:31] our lives amen I'm so thankful for that
[42:35] I'm glad that as the song we just sung
[42:37] he hideth my soul in the Clift of the
[42:41] rock that's what's so important we want
[42:44] to just um go to the Lord in prayer
[42:46] right before we turn to the word tonight
[42:49] I want to say thank you for the uh the
[42:52] testimonies that were given and U so we
[42:56] so have appreciate that and I was able
[42:58] to hear them in the office there and
[43:02] just always appreciate that David said I
[43:04] will talk of thy doings amen and
[43:07] so we appreciate that very much and
[43:15] uh the gentleman was 102 years
[43:19] old you know every time when there's
[43:22] been many times when I've as I've prayed
[43:24] for others and I read in Isa Isaiah 53 I
[43:28] don't find any
[43:31] notation with a superscript letter that
[43:35] says this only applies to below the age
[43:38] of
[43:39] 65 that's right there you go you know
[43:43] brother Bram told us that brother
[43:45] Bosworth and this was the own own
[43:47] testimony and then you can read it among
[43:49] others brother Bosworth didn't die from
[43:51] any
[43:52] illness he just was ready to go home
[43:56] right he didn't die from any illness you
[44:00] know and even if there is an illness or
[44:03] something as I've said before we we
[44:05] stand on this cancer has never ever
[44:09] taken anybody that's right remember
[44:12] death is only a
[44:14] servant it's a master now because of
[44:17] Calvary death now to the believer only
[44:21] becomes a servant to pull us into the
[44:24] presence of God brother Bram called it
[44:26] like this brother Bram said in one in
[44:28] the one place and Beyond the curtain of
[44:30] time he said that death he said it's
[44:32] just like that just a small little shock
[44:34] and then we're there he said just like
[44:36] when you come from the womb and they
[44:38] spank that baby and it comes in he says
[44:40] just a little shock and we're then on
[44:41] the other
[44:43] side aren't you glad that he made a
[44:46] way
[44:48] amen I'm so thankful for that I have two
[44:51] prayer requests that or two prayer
[44:54] cloths I'm holding in my hand tonight
[44:56] and
[44:57] we just ask the Lord just join with me
[45:00] in prayer that God will
[45:02] just just be merciful to these
[45:05] needs also continue to remember the
[45:07] needs of uh the different ones there in
[45:11] the South uh from my understanding right
[45:14] now everything that I have received and
[45:17] uh with the contact from the brothers
[45:18] there's not been any believers that were
[45:22] hurt within that but many of the uh
[45:26] there's churches you know brother
[45:28] Donnie's church and then brother Barry's
[45:30] Church in those two places has really
[45:32] been working together and brother darl
[45:34] Ward sent a request this morning and
[45:37] text and said just please pray for us
[45:39] because you know there's nothing going
[45:41] on with the government and so you have
[45:43] people going in there and they're just
[45:44] going in and clearing things back and
[45:46] getting to the people but you're getting
[45:49] in among people and he says there's
[45:50] things that you're seeing where there's
[45:52] just
[45:53] anger and he said just pray for us that
[45:55] God will keep keep the brother are safe
[45:57] as they go in there and just trying to
[45:59] move things away and also trying to take
[46:02] supplies in there as well so um just
[46:05] let's just pray I I tell you when you
[46:08] some of you no doubt everybody's seen
[46:10] pictures you've seen Drone footage of
[46:11] those it's amazing those very areas um
[46:15] you know I know Ben drove down in those
[46:16] areas very much there was areas for the
[46:18] men's meetings some of those places we
[46:20] kind of drove there's no more
[46:22] roadway no more and it's not back roads
[46:25] it's Interstate inter State and so
[46:28] there's certain towns that are just
[46:30] wiped off the map brother the Barry sent
[46:31] a couple pictures where just 48 hours
[46:34] before you see all these shops all along
[46:36] the road and then 48 hours later it's
[46:40] nothing and it's just dirt and rock and
[46:43] the roads all
[46:44] gone I tell you if there's one thing
[46:47] about
[46:49] it that is really just a scratch
[46:51] compared to what's coming in the
[46:54] tribulation and I don't say I don't say
[46:56] that light I say that because I tell you
[47:00] these are thing that's why brother BR
[47:01] says he said cut me open fill me full of
[47:03] sulfur but God don't let me be found
[47:06] here in that tribulation
[47:09] period we want to be ready to go don't
[47:11] we amen and in these times like this
[47:14] let's just go to the Lord in
[47:16] prayer Heavenly
[47:18] Father Lord how we thank you for your
[47:21] mercies once again
[47:24] tonight your heavenly father thank you
[47:26] Lord Lord for the testimonies of your

[48:18] the same anointing tonight oh God the
[48:22] same quickening power Lord that has
[48:24] brought us from death unto life and
[48:26] father that we would Lord yield

[50:43] Chronicles chapter 29
[51:04] I just have just a few verses of
[51:06] scripture that I want
[51:10] to draw from here in 1 Chronicles 29 and
[51:16] I would like to read verses 10 through
[51:17] verses 19 I know you've been standing
[51:20] here just for for a little bit David
[51:23] says in verse 10
[51:27] wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[51:29] all the
[51:31] congregation and said blessed be thou
[51:35] Lord God of Israel Our Father forever
[51:38] and ever thine O Lord is the greatness
[51:42] and the power and the glory and the
[51:45] Victory and the Majesty for all that is
[51:48] in the heaven and in the earth is thine
[51:53] thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art
[51:56] exalted Ed has had above all both riches
[52:01] and honor come of thee and thou reignest
[52:04] over all and in thine hand is power and
[52:08] might and in thine hand is to make great
[52:11] and to give strength unto all now
[52:15] therefore Our God we thank thee and
[52:18] praise thy glorious name but who am I
[52:22] and what is my people that we should be
[52:24] able to offer so willingly after this
[52:28] sort for all things come of thee and of
[52:32] thine own have we given thee for we are
[52:37] strangers before thee and sojourners as
[52:40] were all our fathers our days on the
[52:43] Earth are as a shadow and there is none
[52:46] abiding oh Lord Our God all this store
[52:51] that we have prepared to build thee in
[52:53] house for thine Holy Name cometh of
[52:56] thine hand and is all thine Lord I know
[53:00] also my God that thou triest the heart
[53:04] and has pleasure in uprightness as for
[53:07] me in the uprightness of my heart I have
[53:10] willingly offered all these things and
[53:14] now have I seen with joy thy people
[53:17] which are present here to offer
[53:19] willingly unto thee Oh Lord God of
[53:23] Abraham Isaac and of Israel our fathers
[53:27] keep this forever in the imagination
[53:32] Hallelujah of the thoughts of the hearts
[53:34] of thy people and prepare their heart
[53:38] unto thee and give unto Solomon my son a
[53:42] perfect heart to keep thy Commandments
[53:46] thy testimonies and thy statutes and to
[53:49] do all these things and to build the
[53:51] palace for the which I have made
[53:55] provision amen may God bless you and
[53:57] bless the reading of the word as you're
[53:59] being
[54:02] seated
[54:05] um May if we can go ahead and Brianna
[54:07] you can switch it on over I'd like to
[54:09] just speak to you tonight once again
[54:12] and uh try to come into this place of
[54:15] the framing of reality and try to tie
[54:18] this together and um this right when we
[54:23] look here in the scriptures we were
[54:25] looking at last last week of the
[54:27] approach and and the building there of
[54:30] the temple and I want to just draw your
[54:32] attention to that verse that we read in
[54:36] 1 Chronicles 29:18 where David in the
[54:40] midst of his prayer he's asked God keep
[54:43] this forever in the imagination of the
[54:46] thoughts of the hearts of thy people and
[54:49] prepare their heart unto thee you know
[54:52] brother Bram Will Tell Us in the message
[54:55] greatest batt thought that the Mind
[54:57] itself is the Battleground it's the no
[55:01] man's land and so God chose the heart
[55:05] Satan chose the head but that mind being
[55:08] No Man's Land that's where the Prophet
[55:11] said where the powers meet and they test
[55:15] their their powers they they test their
[55:17] capabilities and when you think about it
[55:20] that if my mind your mind it's a no
[55:23] man's land then you know we have a
[55:25] choice on what what we're going to fill
[55:27] it with and it's always you know in one
[55:29] of those things where my desire is is
[55:31] Lord I know he's the one that has to
[55:34] make the word live but I want to just
[55:36] let the word be laid into my spirit I
[55:39] want to let it be laid into my mind I
[55:41] just want to I just want to lay in it
[55:43] because then then God will take and draw
[55:46] from that and you know it's not just him
[55:48] drawing from it but there there is an
[55:50] effect Upon Our Lives from really laying
[55:53] in the presence of God is an effect from
[55:56] being from being in prayer and and
[55:59] praying over the things you know just
[56:01] like when you're listening to a message
[56:02] or you come out of a service there's
[56:04] things that you will take and maybe
[56:06] it'll be tomorrow morning it'll strike
[56:08] your heart and and you'll take it and
[56:10] you'll just begin to pray over maybe
[56:12] it's something that just seemed like
[56:13] it's just turned you around and it's
[56:15] just such a joy in your heart something
[56:17] you've heard and it spoke so deeply
[56:20] maybe it's something that has caused you
[56:22] to go down in your life and you realize
[56:25] this is a loosening to something that's
[56:28] had a hold that's hindered me that I
[56:31] didn't know why this was this way or why
[56:34] this this would come in this way and you
[56:36] know even in that there's a rejoicing as
[56:39] the light of God comes to expose every
[56:44] bit of hold in our life and I'll tell
[56:46] you if we will walk in the light as he's
[56:49] in the light then we have Fellowship
[56:51] that Fellowship there's a growing in our
[56:53] lives of his influence and so you know
[56:57] that to me is just it's a blessed thing
[57:00] that to be able to fill our lives with
[57:03] with the presence of God with the word
[57:05] of God I I've said this to you many
[57:07] times that when I prepare and get ready
[57:09] to minister and you know sometimes it
[57:11] can be where there's just thoughts and
[57:13] things that's just you know things that
[57:15] just been laying there we've been
[57:16] building to it but I just I I my heart's
[57:19] desire is with looking at quote after
[57:21] quote and scripture after scripture
[57:23] which would not even be within the
[57:25] outline I just want my spirit to be so
[57:29] saturated because if there's anything
[57:31] cuz there have been many times I've been
[57:32] standing right here and there's been
[57:35] quotes or scriptures that I didn't put
[57:36] in the outline and I thought man that's
[57:38] a powerful thought but you know that
[57:40] there you know it's just one that was
[57:42] wonderful but then the holy spirit will
[57:44] come right around and all of a sudden
[57:46] that'll come out or maybe something that
[57:48] I've read back there and and maybe
[57:49] something I looked at and thought it
[57:51] didn't fit but I'm glad that God is so
[57:53] mindful to be able to pull on those
[57:56] things just as we have need of it you
[57:58] know that's his promise when the spirit
[58:00] of Truth has come he said I will bring
[58:04] these things to your
[58:07] remembrance he also said when you get in
[58:09] the heat of the battle take no thought
[58:11] what you shall say it shall be given to
[58:14] you in that moment that's right you see
[58:17] all of this when we stand there with the
[58:19] word and looking at it in that way it
[58:21] really brings us into a place of a real
[58:23] rest and you know thinking of how the
[58:26] that Solomon and David would pray this
[58:28] prayer and that aspect of it keep this
[58:31] what what is it that David was asking
[58:35] that God would keep this in the
[58:37] imagination of their hearts in the
[58:39] framework of all their thoughts is this
[58:42] very portion back in verse 17 of to know
[58:46] that these things come from you what we
[58:50] have to surrender to you you have given
[58:54] to us what it is that you're requiring
[58:57] so it's just like when it came to build
[59:00] the Tabernacle in the wilderness as
[59:02] we've looked at many of those pictures
[59:04] then when it came to rebuild the
[59:07] Tabernacle Solomon's Tabernacle to
[59:09] rebuild that after they came back from
[59:11] babyon you know there the needs what was
[59:14] needed God supplied the needs and the
[59:17] people didn't have to go beg for
[59:19] something it was God revealing to them
[59:21] what was already in their possession
[59:24] that's the scripture when when God came
[59:26] to Moses he didn't he didn't ask Moses
[59:29] go find a good rod and this is how the
[59:32] rod has to be but he said what is that
[59:35] in thine hand and that's the same thing
[59:38] when the Holy Spirit you get in his
[59:40] presence he asked what is that in your
[59:43] life what is that longing where you've
[59:45] always had a longing where you couldn't
[59:47] fit in here there was something calling
[59:49] you to more truth what is that in thine
[59:51] hand what is that in your life amen and
[59:55] in the Shina glor Glory it reveals this
[59:57] is why that you could never fit in
[1:00:00] anywhere else this is why you were
[1:00:02] different as far as this were like any
[1:00:04] other flesh but what was it that within
[1:00:07] us that we just couldn't yoke up with
[1:00:09] anything else I'll tell you why it was
[1:00:11] that part of himself that's right that's
[1:00:14] exactly why and let us always remember
[1:00:17] that let that always be in our mind that
[1:00:19] that you know I'm not my own I I'm not
[1:00:22] it's not about me it's about him he's my
[1:00:27] Redeemer I want you to think of how the
[1:00:29] keeping this reality that what God has
[1:00:32] given to us I want you to watch how
[1:00:34] brother Bram says this in the message
[1:00:36] dedication he says if this church he's
[1:00:38] talking about the one he's dedicating if
[1:00:40] it only had 12 he's referring back to
[1:00:43] the the the Church of Ephesus which only
[1:00:45] had 12 people in it I like that church
[1:00:48] and completely surrendered to God he can
[1:00:50] do more with that 12 than he could with
[1:00:54] the rest of the world it's the surrender
[1:00:57] that we have where the truth of the
[1:01:00] Gospel not only goes from the platform
[1:01:03] but Finds Its bed in the hearts of the
[1:01:06] people and reacts
[1:01:09] back that's the key it's the surrender
[1:01:13] we have you know we don't want the word
[1:01:16] to roll off of us we want to absorb it
[1:01:20] God I I want my life to be a in a in a
[1:01:24] place to absorb I you know know even
[1:01:26] that it isn't that I have to remember
[1:01:28] every single detail when I come out of
[1:01:30] service because it isn't about so much
[1:01:33] my mind but Lord let me stay here like
[1:01:36] like that of a negative in the oldtime
[1:01:38] cameras that you could open them up in a
[1:01:40] night field and they would collect the
[1:01:42] light as it was coming upon the negative
[1:01:45] let my life oh God let me absorb what it
[1:01:49] is of your presence right here tonight
[1:01:52] Lord let me absorb that Lord yes your
[1:01:56] desire yes sir you know you're built to
[1:01:58] absorb that as a son and daughter of God
[1:02:00] absolutely is that right you're built to
[1:02:03] absorb that when the word of God is
[1:02:05] being preached the word of God is a
[1:02:07] place listen God did not send this
[1:02:09] message that it would just somewhere
[1:02:11] fall somewhere else you were the
[1:02:14] intended target you are the intended
[1:02:16] betting ground you are the one that he
[1:02:18] had in mind you are the one the wound
[1:02:21] that he chose to bring forth His Image
[1:02:23] through you are his
[1:02:26] desire and his desire is to see himself
[1:02:30] reflected in you and I thank you Lord
[1:02:33] It's the surrender we have that's that's
[1:02:34] the whole that's the key to all the
[1:02:36] victory in our life is the surrender and
[1:02:39] let as as David said let him keep this
[1:02:42] in the imagination of their thoughts and
[1:02:44] I I'll say it like this that's a battle
[1:02:47] but always let us remember we belong to
[1:02:50] him let me read you a few scriptures
[1:02:52] here in Psalms 103 know ye that the Lord
[1:02:56] he is God it is he that hath made us and
[1:02:59] not we
[1:03:01] ourselves you did not make yourselves
[1:03:04] listen even in the natural it was not
[1:03:06] you going up to a value menu and saying
[1:03:09] I want this eye color this no shape you
[1:03:12] did not choose that you had no choosing
[1:03:14] even in your coming here to this Earth
[1:03:17] but God in his grace his presence moves
[1:03:20] over your life and it moves upon
[1:03:23] something of himself in our life and
[1:03:26] then as that surrender it brings us to a
[1:03:28] place of not what I can do but God the
[1:03:31] revelation of his very mind begins to
[1:03:34] break upon our life and his love coming
[1:03:37] forth it brings forth the surrender and
[1:03:39] then it is him that has made us and not
[1:03:43] ourselves we are his
[1:03:45] workmanship we never we never became
[1:03:48] Christians on a certain day we were
[1:03:50] always
[1:03:51] Christians the prophet said in future
[1:03:54] home he said we were always saved you
[1:03:56] have just come now to recognize it amen
[1:04:01] is that right so then we are his people
[1:04:06] and the Sheep of his pasture once I have
[1:04:08] been redeemed I may have I here I am in
[1:04:12] the Shell of a Browning I've got I've
[1:04:15] got traits of a Browning Browns all the
[1:04:17] all the southers all the names we could
[1:04:19] go on down I've got all of that but when
[1:04:21] once that Soul has been redeemed that's
[1:04:25] my identity is a Son of God is a
[1:04:28] daughter of God I I don't want that
[1:04:30] identity of a fallen Identity or to take
[1:04:34] the way that the brownings have taken
[1:04:36] the southers have taken and all the rest
[1:04:38] of you can put your last name in it cuz
[1:04:39] there ain't nobody above nobody
[1:04:41] else it's got to be something on the
[1:04:44] inside of
[1:04:46] us that's that's what's different that's
[1:04:49] the real gold of almighty God Titus 2:14
[1:04:54] who gave himself aren't you glad for
[1:04:56] that that he might redeem us that we
[1:04:59] belong to him always from all iniquity
[1:05:04] and purify unto himself a peculiar
[1:05:07] people zelous of good works you know
[1:05:10] when God's desire it moves begins to
[1:05:13] move on your heart and he moves in your
[1:05:15] life you know what it pulsates in your
[1:05:17] life is a desire to walk pleasing to him
[1:05:21] it's not you listen it's not you
[1:05:23] performing The Works it's your faith in
[1:05:26] a finished work that causes you to walk
[1:05:30] contrary to your own thinking that
[1:05:32] causes you to walk contrary to the way
[1:05:35] you used to walk that is Works being
[1:05:38] manifest of the faith that's in your
[1:05:40] life remember they thought Abraham was
[1:05:43] crazy because Abraham had a vision
[1:05:46] Abraham had a vision he had heard what
[1:05:48] God had said but one day the evidence
[1:05:51] was there one day everybody else could
[1:05:55] see
[1:05:56] what Abraham
[1:05:57] heard are you hearing me he walked by
[1:06:00] that Vision what caused him to act this
[1:06:02] way make these payments on the baby Bill
[1:06:05] what caused him to navigate through all
[1:06:08] unbelief what caused him to repent when
[1:06:11] the word came to correct him because he
[1:06:13] had heard from God and anytime there was
[1:06:16] something in his life that didn't meet
[1:06:18] up with what God had called and God
[1:06:21] revealed he quickly stepped back in line
[1:06:23] by the grace of God and then why is that
[1:06:26] what he had heard one day you saw amen
[1:06:32] amen zelus of good
[1:06:36] works the scripture we read from last
[1:06:38] week know you not that your body is the
[1:06:42] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:06:45] which you have of God and you are not
[1:06:48] your own I this a question for ye are
[1:06:51] bought with a price therefore glorify
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:56] in your body and in your spirit which
[1:06:59] are Gods now think of this what God has
[1:07:02] come to redeem is that soul and from the
[1:07:06] Redemption of the Soul it ties you in
[1:07:10] you have a reservation for the Rapture
[1:07:13] you have the token for the Rapture you
[1:07:15] have the already received the earnest
[1:07:18] down payment that will lead you to the
[1:07:21] very change of the body it it will be
[1:07:25] your Soul uh kind lining up then with
[1:07:28] the theophany and a glorified
[1:07:31] body that's so good yes sir but in the
[1:07:35] meantime this is
[1:07:37] where we have to walk with that
[1:07:41] realization he's redeemed me I'm not a
[1:07:46] slave I'm I'm I'm a I'm a prisoner of
[1:07:49] Jesus Christ yes amen yeah I could do I
[1:07:52] could do I can do what I want to do but
[1:07:54] as Paul said in multiple places in
[1:07:56] Corinthians there's things that I don't
[1:07:58] want to if anything takes away from the
[1:08:00] counsel of God in my life everything
[1:08:02] itself is not it it does not work to the
[1:08:05] advantage in my life I I only want to do
[1:08:07] that which is pleasing to him right
[1:08:10] think of this in our body and our spirit
[1:08:12] now you might look and say well once
[1:08:14] he's redeemed you know because brother
[1:08:15] Braham said it like this he said you
[1:08:17] know he said if I never preach another
[1:08:19] sermon he said I'm saved
[1:08:21] right right I'm saved but you see here's
[1:08:25] the pairs the powerful thing is that
[1:08:27] there's another place in the scripture
[1:08:29] to show you how much of a responsibility
[1:08:32] that God has usted you and I with it
[1:08:35] says that every one of us must appear
[1:08:38] before the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:08:40] that's not the white Throne judgment but
[1:08:42] appear before the Judgment seat of
[1:08:44] Christ to give an answer for the Deeds
[1:08:48] that were done in the
[1:08:50] body I tell you I don't want to stand
[1:08:52] there that day and God said you know you
[1:08:55] are mine but you you were a troublemaker
[1:09:00] buddy I don't want to stand there on
[1:09:02] that day I don't want to stand there I
[1:09:04] don't believe anybody wants to stand
[1:09:06] there in that time you know to stand
[1:09:09] there in where he would say there listen
[1:09:10] friend this is not the white Throne
[1:09:11] judgment this is that which belongeth to
[1:09:14] the
[1:09:14] Believers I don't want to stand there
[1:09:16] and say you know what you could have
[1:09:18] been so much more of an asset to your
[1:09:20] church but instead you cause
[1:09:23] trouble you you you are you could have
[1:09:26] been so much more I don't want I don't
[1:09:27] want to stand there on a day listen let
[1:09:29] me just be very clear this is the time
[1:09:31] when rewards are handed out I'm not
[1:09:34] interested in rewards I Don't Got My
[1:09:36] Mind Set On A Certain reward there's one
[1:09:39] thing that I have my desire set on and
[1:09:42] that's the change of the body the
[1:09:45] Rapture means everything to me I don't
[1:09:48] want to stay here and the Rapture even
[1:09:51] on a daily basis I don't want to stay in
[1:09:53] the condition of this
[1:09:56] realm that's what means
[1:10:01] everything remember the prophet said
[1:10:03] it'll take perfect love to get there
[1:10:05] that's right right it's good to that
[1:10:07] that's what it'll take I say oh God you
[1:10:10] know listen friends let the love of God
[1:10:12] so move in your heart and Lord bring out
[1:10:14] a real completion in my life a full
[1:10:17] maturing Lord I'm moving right into the
[1:10:19] adoption because remember the prophet
[1:10:22] over and over we're living in the time
[1:10:24] of the adoption this is the adoption
[1:10:26] message this is the message that leads
[1:10:29] to Sons and Daughters of God coming into
[1:10:32] adoption there's no other word that can
[1:10:35] bring that it's an end time Revelation
[1:10:38] where Christ himself has revealed
[1:10:40] himself as the mighty conqueror why to
[1:10:43] call Sons and Daughters into full
[1:10:45] adoption no other age had a mount
[1:10:48] Transfiguration experience this is the
[1:10:50] age of Mount Transfiguration
[1:10:53] Hallelujah and the Prophet would tell us
[1:10:56] over and over what's holding up the
[1:10:59] adoption is our
[1:11:03] Behavior he would speak of those things
[1:11:05] you know of how that listen these are
[1:11:08] things always Satan is always listen his
[1:11:11] objective let me just say this his
[1:11:13] objective is always to try to thwart and
[1:11:16] hinder the expression of Christ through
[1:11:19] your
[1:11:21] life you could be offended today and
[1:11:24] dwell up in that and dwell in that and
[1:11:26] let it overtake you to where you're no
[1:11:29] longer an effective witness and there
[1:11:30] might be somebody tomorrow that needed
[1:11:33] you to be a
[1:11:34] witness and isn't necessarily what we
[1:11:37] say it's the expression of our
[1:11:39] life is that
[1:11:41] right now watch this Paul goes on to say
[1:11:45] this let me just just trying to drop
[1:11:46] this in very quickly Paul goes on to say
[1:11:48] we're not we are not debtors Brethren to
[1:11:51] the flesh I don't owe the flesh nothing
[1:11:54] that's right well you you know my
[1:11:56] feelings been hurt that's my flesh I'm
[1:11:59] not making light of that everybody
[1:12:00] understand that I'm not making light of
[1:12:02] that that's not what I'm saying because
[1:12:03] you know what I got feelings too and the
[1:12:06] Holy Ghost don't strip out your
[1:12:08] feelings the new birth comes it don't do
[1:12:10] away with that but now you've received a
[1:12:13] strength and a power to be able not just
[1:12:16] to withstand it but to bring it in line
[1:12:19] right that's what the Holy Spirit it
[1:12:21] comes to bring us into a place of a real
[1:12:24] expression and a
[1:12:26] with Jesus
[1:12:27] Christ you know what there's a growing
[1:12:30] there's a growing if you look in your
[1:12:31] life tonight and say I'm falling a
[1:12:33] little short hey it's a time to grow say
[1:12:36] thank you Lord for your grace that's how
[1:12:38] you grow you grow by first taking
[1:12:40] account in your life and saying Lord I
[1:12:42] need to grow up a little bit more
[1:12:44] there's some things I need to get a
[1:12:45] little higher you will always find in
[1:12:48] the message of the hour you will find
[1:12:50] the prophet always in humility asking
[1:12:53] God for more grace in his life
[1:12:57] always if we if we live after the flesh
[1:13:00] we'll die but if we through the spirit
[1:13:02] do mortify keep dead the Deeds of the
[1:13:05] body you shall live nothing lay down
[1:13:07] there you're
[1:13:08] dead for as many as are led by the
[1:13:12] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:13:14] that's a key are LED we're not made to
[1:13:16] do something oh I have to do this and oh
[1:13:19] I better do this yeah I I better no
[1:13:21] that's they're still under the law but
[1:13:24] when we are
[1:13:25] LED is the desire to do what is pleasing
[1:13:29] to him though I feel the Warfare the
[1:13:33] contrary that's pulled but is to be led
[1:13:36] by the spirit of God it's not the well I
[1:13:38] tell you if I wasn't a Christian this is
[1:13:40] what I would do no no no it's to be led
[1:13:44] right amen this is where Peter said
[1:13:47] you're a chosen generation a royal
[1:13:49] priesthood a holy nation A peculiar
[1:13:52] people you belong to somebody and you
[1:13:54] should show forth the Praises of him
[1:13:57] that hath called you out of Darkness
[1:14:00] Into His Marvelous Light very very
[1:14:04] important here you have not just been
[1:14:06] called to the seven lampstands amen it
[1:14:09] is the seventh lampstand that has
[1:14:12] revealed the pathway into the Shak Glory
[1:14:17] Hallelujah that's right are you hearing
[1:14:18] me it's the it's a it's a revelation the
[1:14:21] Seven Stars in his hand it is God's
[1:14:24] illumination of his word that shows you
[1:14:26] and I the pathway well who is that
[1:14:29] that's Christ he said I am the way the
[1:14:31] truth and the life it shows us the way
[1:14:34] back into Fellowship it shows us back
[1:14:37] into relationship Into His Marvelous
[1:14:40] Light and that Marvelous Light can never
[1:14:43] be blown out sir that's right that's
[1:14:46] shakina light that's the first light
[1:14:48] that struck the
[1:14:49] Earth amen so with that in mind Christ
[1:14:53] is our absolute yes he is yes he's our
[1:14:57] absolute he's the one who's our absolute
[1:14:59] this is why you remember even we looked
[1:15:01] at the scripture last week let the peace
[1:15:04] of God rule be the Umpire in our
[1:15:07] life
[1:15:10] right I know sometimes this
[1:15:12] happens uh where you know maybe somebody
[1:15:14] in a little little game or whatever more
[1:15:17] and there they can have a hard time
[1:15:19] filling in spots and they'll ask Daddy
[1:15:21] to be the Umpire for his little boy
[1:15:26] I don't care how much Daddy says and
[1:15:28] could say I'm going to be as honest I'm
[1:15:31] not going to I'm not going to I'm going
[1:15:33] to call a strike when it's a strike and
[1:15:35] I'm going to call a foul you know if
[1:15:36] it's in basketball I'm going to call
[1:15:38] this and listen there is an
[1:15:41] affinity that Daddy has to where even in
[1:15:44] Daddy's mind you can get well I don't
[1:15:46] want to crush them you know they've
[1:15:47] struck out they've you know their their
[1:15:49] nickname is strikeout king queen I don't
[1:15:51] want to you know I don't want to offend
[1:15:52] them you see what'll happen it'll start
[1:15:54] a play
[1:15:55] in the gates of their spirit and then
[1:15:58] the Umpire is not really being a true
[1:16:02] umpire but an Umpire is one who is
[1:16:06] neutral amen it is one who stands there
[1:16:09] that no matter what it is it might only
[1:16:12] be a millimeter over the plate is that
[1:16:14] right brother Shane it's a
[1:16:16] strike you might you could argue I don't
[1:16:19] care how you want to argue but the
[1:16:20] Umpire is looking at it and saying this
[1:16:22] you know what you can fuss all you want
[1:16:25] but once the ninth inning is over I'm
[1:16:27] going home and I'm going to have me a
[1:16:29] nice Coca-Cola and you can argue all you
[1:16:32] want right an Umpire is there cuz could
[1:16:36] you imagine if you didn't have an Umpire
[1:16:38] you'd have people just you know I mean
[1:16:40] we have the kind of that chaos right now
[1:16:41] sometimes you have people you know
[1:16:43] that's arguing and bickering and you
[1:16:45] probably wouldn't get past the first
[1:16:47] inning or second inning right
[1:16:50] right it'd be like well never mind I
[1:16:52] won't say that you know it just it's
[1:16:55] that within it you know that's why there
[1:16:57] the Umpire has got to be Christ in our
[1:17:02] soul that's the peace of God if we want
[1:17:05] the peace of God let him rule in our
[1:17:07] hearts in other words he's there saying
[1:17:10] uh-uh that's not it uh-uh that's not it
[1:17:14] I want that voice to be more prevalent
[1:17:17] than my
[1:17:19] feelings yes sir is that right I want to
[1:17:22] feed that white dog that's the Umpire
[1:17:24] Christ is our absolute and what I mean
[1:17:26] by an absolute it is not just when we
[1:17:29] say the written word but remember it is
[1:17:31] word and spirit so it's the character of
[1:17:35] Jesus Christ we're talking
[1:17:37] about right that's why the prophet could
[1:17:39] say in that last quote I read to you
[1:17:41] last week and he said oh God let me hold
[1:17:43] my hands up tie his Commandments on the
[1:17:46] tie poost of my mind let my meditation
[1:17:48] be him when somebody comes to make me
[1:17:50] angry let me see Jesus when Temptation
[1:17:53] arises let let me see
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:17:58] Jesus Hallelujah sir let the word of let
[1:18:02] the word of Christ dwell in you richly
[1:18:06] let it be the source that's what dwell
[1:18:08] means let it be the source of influence
[1:18:11] in our lives let it dwell in you richly
[1:18:14] in all wisdom teaching admonishing one
[1:18:16] another in Psalms hymns and spiritual
[1:18:18] songs singing with Grace in your hearts
[1:18:20] to the Lord I want to just you know
[1:18:22] think of this where David has prayed God
[1:18:26] keep this in the imagination of their
[1:18:30] thoughts that everything comes of you
[1:18:34] anything that they have to offer lord
[1:18:37] it's what you have given them you know
[1:18:39] any talent you have every one of us
[1:18:41] listen let me just say this to you
[1:18:43] everybody in here has a
[1:18:45] gift I can't preach this out tonight but
[1:18:48] everybody in here had listen when you
[1:18:50] and then when you come into the body of
[1:18:52] Jesus Christ when you're into the body
[1:18:54] of Christ then Christ himself will
[1:18:56] position you that's why the prophet
[1:18:58] could say even one of the positionings
[1:19:01] even in the body of Christ as a
[1:19:03] housewife factory worker come on now it
[1:19:07] ain't just preachers it isn't just
[1:19:08] looking at something of a of a spiritual
[1:19:10] office but it is Christ himself being
[1:19:14] reflected in the position that he has
[1:19:16] for you in the
[1:19:18] body so with that in mind God let him
[1:19:21] keep this in mind what is it that
[1:19:23] there's a willingness to to re yield a
[1:19:27] willingness to surrender what God has
[1:19:30] given that's what your desire is Lord I
[1:19:33] want to be willing I want my heart to be
[1:19:35] willing if what whatever Lord if the
[1:19:37] willingness that you ask of me Lord a
[1:19:39] willingness if a willingness to let this
[1:19:41] go a willingness to let this go I want I
[1:19:43] want that kind of a willingness don't
[1:19:46] you so it's always that yielding it'll
[1:19:49] always be a really a a real
[1:19:52] self-sacrifice and so as we look at this
[1:19:54] I want to just take this thought is
[1:19:57] Imagination versus
[1:19:59] reality because when imagination you
[1:20:02] know you can imagine things to be ever
[1:20:05] so real and they're not you can actually
[1:20:09] imagine things that you think has
[1:20:11] happened and it didn't happen that's
[1:20:14] right that's right yes sir now it
[1:20:17] depends on how honest we're going to
[1:20:19] be right we we we you say Lord I'm not
[1:20:22] going to spiritualize things it's it's
[1:20:24] just I'm going to be honest with the
[1:20:26] word I want you to think about this
[1:20:29] we've all seen this picture probably
[1:20:31] most of us have this was taken in
[1:20:33] Houston right right and the Holy Spirit
[1:20:38] how the pillar of fire came down and he
[1:20:41] had his picture brother BR said taken
[1:20:43] with
[1:20:45] us and he came down and you know to me I
[1:20:50] when I look at the picture I'm not I'm
[1:20:52] not caught up with the man I thank God
[1:20:54] for brother br I thank God for the
[1:20:55] prophet of God but I realize that's
[1:20:58] that's that's where the Prophet was
[1:20:59] getting his instructions
[1:21:01] from is the pillar of fire he wasn't
[1:21:04] just pulling stuff out of thin air he
[1:21:06] wasn't making it up you see he had an
[1:21:11] absolute is that right it has an
[1:21:13] absolute that's why listen that's why
[1:21:15] the New Birth when the new birth is com
[1:21:17] in your life you've got an
[1:21:19] absolute and the prophet said when the
[1:21:21] New Birth has come to you then you
[1:21:23] become the absolute of that
[1:21:25] scripture woo it's powerful isn't it
[1:21:28] because why it's Christ not you it's
[1:21:31] Christ interpreting the absolute of his
[1:21:34] thought through your
[1:21:36] life that's yes sir
[1:21:39] that's I want you to think of this here
[1:21:41] I'm going to I'm going to read some
[1:21:42] portions out of a quote and then I'll
[1:21:44] get to some of the latter Parts here
[1:21:47] brother brand says now if you stood
[1:21:48] tonight and you looked at that angel
[1:21:51] circling there's many of you in here
[1:21:53] perhaps has never never seen it that
[1:21:55] light of Pillar of Fire that led the
[1:21:57] children of Israel that come into the
[1:21:59] prison cells with Peter and delivered
[1:22:01] him from the prison this same Angel of
[1:22:05] the Lord and here it is after all those
[1:22:09] hundreds yes thousands of years is still
[1:22:12] here with us now it's had his picture
[1:22:15] taken standing where I was standing no
[1:22:19] not for me but for the church the body
[1:22:23] of Believers see it's to
[1:22:26] everyone I believe that it was actually
[1:22:28] a pillar of fire that led the children
[1:22:30] of
[1:22:31] Israel just a pillar of fire he said I
[1:22:35] actually believe that that light come
[1:22:36] into the prison where Peter was at he
[1:22:39] said don't you believe that testimony he
[1:22:41] said I believe it with all my heart just
[1:22:43] more than I believe my name is William
[1:22:45] brandom I believe that story but we have
[1:22:48] a more stricter fundamental proof of it
[1:22:53] than that we have a more stricter
[1:22:57] fundamental proof now I I believe that
[1:22:59] by faith What Now watch how he's going
[1:23:01] here what if the angel of the Lord was
[1:23:04] standing here now circling and every one
[1:23:09] of your eyes would be visualized to see
[1:23:12] it so it's circling and every one of our
[1:23:15] eyes be visualized to see
[1:23:18] it some of you remember we were here in
[1:23:20] one of that first opening nights it's
[1:23:21] been multiple times I've had it reported
[1:23:23] to me but I I remember that one night in
[1:23:25] here it was when we did the first
[1:23:27] streaming in in the covid time and that
[1:23:29] I I thought I didn't know there was only
[1:23:30] 10 of us here I didn't know what took
[1:23:32] place but you know what there was a
[1:23:34] great flash that that came that came
[1:23:37] through and in other reports but that
[1:23:40] just goes to show listen it's God still
[1:23:43] with his people because the angel of the
[1:23:47] Lord accompanies his
[1:23:50] message wherever the message is preached
[1:23:53] not man's ideas but wherever the message
[1:23:56] is preached the pillar of fire is still
[1:23:59] there to make it
[1:24:01] [Applause]
[1:24:03] real he said now what if it was here and
[1:24:06] in your eyes would become visualized to
[1:24:08] see
[1:24:09] it that would be pretty good watch this
[1:24:13] but to look at the picture of it is far
[1:24:16] more proof than what it was if you were
[1:24:19] looking at it with your eyes I want you
[1:24:22] to catch this he said this is is far
[1:24:24] more proof looking at the picture than
[1:24:27] if you were looking at it with your
[1:24:30] eyes he said because you could have an
[1:24:33] optical
[1:24:34] illusion th this right here I could
[1:24:36] preach a Month of Sundays on this
[1:24:38] quote that's camera a camera won't take
[1:24:41] an optical
[1:24:45] illusion can I just preach just a moment
[1:24:49] this is why our experience is not based
[1:24:51] upon Sensations our experience is based
[1:24:55] on the word of God Sensations will lie
[1:24:58] to you but the word of God is more sure
[1:25:02] than every
[1:25:03] sensation heavens and earth will pass
[1:25:06] away but my word shall never
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:13] fail Hallelujah cameras won't take
[1:25:16] optical
[1:25:17] illusions it will take the actual
[1:25:20] picture it has to be there to strike the
[1:25:27] lens you can have optical illusions so
[1:25:30] in other words if I'm taking a picture
[1:25:33] and I say oh it was there it was there
[1:25:35] it was there but if you take the picture
[1:25:36] and it's not
[1:25:38] there then that's your
[1:25:41] imagination remember brother br's
[1:25:43] talking about this all the way through
[1:25:44] the message because many including the
[1:25:47] man who was impressed to take the
[1:25:50] picture and mind you it was the seventh
[1:25:53] negative that was
[1:25:57] developed the man that even took the
[1:26:01] picture had thought it was just things
[1:26:04] that people were
[1:26:07] imagining is that
[1:26:09] right you can have optical illusions and
[1:26:12] things that looks like it is when it's
[1:26:15] not and it could be psychology you see
[1:26:18] you you could say you see it there you
[1:26:20] see it there you ever had people you're
[1:26:22] looking at a picture and you say you see
[1:26:23] it you see you see and then all say you
[1:26:26] don't want to be like dummy yeah yeah I
[1:26:30] don't want to be left out of this yeah
[1:26:33] yeah but then everybody knows those
[1:26:35] pictures that we sometimes you see and
[1:26:38] there's hidden messages in those
[1:26:40] pictures right is that right yeah the
[1:26:43] prophet will take that example about
[1:26:44] hidden messages hidden in the hidden in
[1:26:46] the pictures like you take the FedEx
[1:26:47] truck it's an arrow in there right and
[1:26:51] the prophet will refer to that in trying
[1:26:52] to do God a service he said see that's
[1:26:54] how the message is whenever you see one
[1:26:57] of those pictures like that he said
[1:26:59] that's how it is when you see this
[1:27:01] message you can't unsee it once you've
[1:27:04] seen it you've seen
[1:27:06] it calling out every time that's the
[1:27:10] message that's the message that's the
[1:27:12] message that's the message that's Christ
[1:27:14] that's
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:21] Christ he said it could be psychology
[1:27:23] you know and you could say you see that
[1:27:26] and you just keep saying it yes I
[1:27:28] believe it and believe it so much until
[1:27:32] you actually think you see it when you
[1:27:36] don't that's
[1:27:38] psychology it's just got you so mentally
[1:27:42] pressed towards it till you just imagine
[1:27:45] it so imagine it so much till it becomes
[1:27:49] a reality isn't that incredible imagine
[1:27:53] it so so much till it becomes a
[1:27:59] reality some of you wondering wondering
[1:28:01] where am I going well I'm going to I'm
[1:28:03] staying in this quote I just read you
[1:28:04] the first little bit I'm staying right
[1:28:06] here I want you to just to think of that
[1:28:09] you could be so mentally pressed towards
[1:28:11] it till you just imagine it until it
[1:28:14] would become a reality brother Brown
[1:28:17] says it like this next paragraph you
[1:28:20] just imagine somebody hates you once and
[1:28:23] they don't hate you but you imagine they
[1:28:26] do and you just keep thinking that's the
[1:28:30] error right
[1:28:32] there keep thinking the Bible said come
[1:28:35] on cast down every imagination well they
[1:28:40] hate me but remember where word of stand
[1:28:44] is is to not allow that to take resident
[1:28:47] in our life the Bible said give no place
[1:28:49] to the devil is that right give no place
[1:28:53] that that word place means Retreat which
[1:28:56] is an
[1:28:57] excuse it tells us tear down
[1:29:01] strongholds right sometimes there's
[1:29:03] strongholds there's complexes that have
[1:29:06] been developed in our
[1:29:08] lives and certain things can be said or
[1:29:10] done and it like trigger like a
[1:29:12] flashback that's a stronghold and the
[1:29:15] enemy could even know way way way way
[1:29:18] back if I can sew this in it will always
[1:29:21] be something to we eventually that when
[1:29:23] the is coming forth they'll pull back on
[1:29:25] it but let me tell you something that's
[1:29:27] good and I'm not talking to you let me
[1:29:30] tell the devil something God is in the
[1:29:32] business of tearing down walls yes he
[1:29:35] does he had a daughter by the name of
[1:29:37] Rahab that wanted to get out of that
[1:29:39] wall City she knew the Jubilee was
[1:29:43] on she couldn't tear the walls down but
[1:29:47] God tore the walls down for
[1:29:50] her what brought those walls down her
[1:29:53] faith in in the word of
[1:29:55] God what she heard caused those walls to
[1:29:59] crumble your faith in the word of God
[1:30:02] will tear down complexes it'll tear down
[1:30:06] strongholds to where the enemy has no
[1:30:09] place to run
[1:30:11] to hallu Hallelujah That's The Power of
[1:30:15] Jesus
[1:30:18] Christ hallu they don't like me and the
[1:30:21] first thing you know watch Watch What
[1:30:23] Happens huh what's what happens the
[1:30:25] first thing you know you'll be shunning
[1:30:28] that person wait a minute my thought
[1:30:32] that they don't like me is what's
[1:30:34] causing me to act funny
[1:30:39] y I want to ask you to raise your hand
[1:30:41] we've all been
[1:30:42] there Satan will just drop a little
[1:30:45] thought so and so don't like
[1:30:47] you so and so thinks
[1:30:51] this come on friends let me just let me
[1:30:53] just let you in on a little something
[1:30:55] whether I'm preaching here or preaching
[1:30:56] other places you think the devil has not
[1:30:59] tried to come and put things and said
[1:31:01] this one's disagreeing this one's
[1:31:02] disagreeing I'm not following the
[1:31:06] devil I'm not going to follow the devil
[1:31:10] they might have a tummy ache that may be
[1:31:11] why their face looks that way I don't
[1:31:14] know I don't know I don't know what's
[1:31:16] going on maybe they got a pain in their
[1:31:18] body I don't know maybe something else
[1:31:20] is going on in their I don't know that
[1:31:22] you see you see how s would like to
[1:31:24] derail it and then take the minister off
[1:31:27] in another way and it leaves the Sheep
[1:31:30] hungry because Satan is afraid of this
[1:31:33] word getting in the batting grounds
[1:31:36] because the effect when this word comes
[1:31:39] in it has power to react back and the
[1:31:42] reaction is
[1:31:48] Christ after a while he says you're
[1:31:50] shunning that person when they haven't
[1:31:52] done nothing to you
[1:31:55] and after a while it becomes such a
[1:31:57] reality to you till you actually believe
[1:32:00] that that person doesn't like
[1:32:03] you and you might ball them out for it
[1:32:05] or say something to
[1:32:08] you brother Willie what was wrong with
[1:32:11] you the
[1:32:13] W what are you talking
[1:32:15] about what are you talking about the S
[1:32:18] my my stomach what what are you talking
[1:32:20] about oh oh I'm sorry brother I I see
[1:32:24] you're looking that way when I was
[1:32:25] making certain statements
[1:32:28] oh come on friends come on come on the
[1:32:31] devil can get right on people's shoulder
[1:32:32] he was looking right at you who do you
[1:32:34] want me to look
[1:32:36] at maybe take an arrow and divert it to
[1:32:40] hold up an
[1:32:43] arrow where do you want me to look but
[1:32:45] you see what the enemy does he's trying
[1:32:47] to divert from the real need he doesn't
[1:32:51] want the word getting to where it needs
[1:32:54] to get
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:56] to and you might ball them out or say
[1:32:59] something to you for instant I'm not
[1:33:01] going to be much longer but I this is
[1:33:03] I'm burning up for instance I forgot all
[1:33:06] about it for instance your
[1:33:09] wife or your husband oh Lord or some
[1:33:13] neighbor or something like that when
[1:33:16] that person is absolutely innocent of
[1:33:20] any ill
[1:33:22] thing I won't ask husbands that have had
[1:33:25] wrong perceptions about their wife wife
[1:33:28] that's had it's quiet I'm okay with that
[1:33:31] wife that all of a sudden has had a
[1:33:32] wrong
[1:33:34] perception you know one of the worst
[1:33:36] things you can do is get in the corner
[1:33:38] and not talk to one
[1:33:42] another come on now listen friends I'm
[1:33:45] just trying to say you know what the
[1:33:46] enemy is all about putting up
[1:33:49] divisions but in order to talk
[1:33:51] somebody's got to start out with the
[1:33:52] ears yeah unless somebody else start out
[1:33:55] with the
[1:33:56] mouth and the person who's with the ears
[1:33:58] God give me Grace not to stand here as
[1:34:01] one who is defending and I'm going to
[1:34:03] lay out my argument cuz you know that
[1:34:05] won't go very far either that that won't
[1:34:08] go very far because look the thing
[1:34:09] sometimes that we perceive it seems very
[1:34:14] real right there was a lady in a in a
[1:34:16] store the one time and these shootings
[1:34:19] were going on and things like this it
[1:34:20] wasn't happen in the store at that time
[1:34:23] but all of all of a sudden this shooting
[1:34:24] and you know she hears something and all
[1:34:26] of a sudden there's this big pop that
[1:34:28] goes off and what had actually happened
[1:34:31] is is where she had fallen and this pop
[1:34:35] goes off and she thinks oh Lord
[1:34:37] Something's Happened and she reaches
[1:34:39] back and she feels what she thinks is
[1:34:42] that her brains have come out of her
[1:34:45] head and you know what it actually was
[1:34:47] was a can of biscuits that exploded and
[1:34:51] the pop and she reached back and felt
[1:34:54] that you see sometimes we we can laugh
[1:34:56] at that but how many other things
[1:34:58] friends how many other things and look
[1:35:01] you say well I I'm tell you I'm really
[1:35:03] Discerning this this is my question if
[1:35:06] we're calling it the spirit of
[1:35:08] discernment it should look like Christ
[1:35:11] act like Christ never be any different
[1:35:13] from you say what do you mean I'll tell
[1:35:15] you what I mean when it came time for
[1:35:17] the Betrayal nobody questioned Judas
[1:35:20] there had never been any actions
[1:35:24] between Jesus and Judas that would have
[1:35:26] said you know I've seen you you you know
[1:35:28] how he's kind of passed the plate around
[1:35:30] him before you've seen how he's done
[1:35:32] that he's the guy I know it right there
[1:35:34] see there was no enmity right right
[1:35:37] there was no malice you see when you let
[1:35:39] things build in your life when a wrong
[1:35:41] has even when it's a wrong that's been
[1:35:42] done you might have the actual
[1:35:44] photograph I have the photograph but if
[1:35:48] you keep that right it only affect you
[1:35:52] it'll affect everybody right
[1:35:54] you're associated with that's scripture
[1:35:56] right don't let a root of bigger
[1:35:58] bitterness springing up well they have
[1:36:01] to pay for this that's called malice
[1:36:03] malice is a desire to injure one person
[1:36:08] they've made me suffer they must
[1:36:14] suffer but like David said oh God keep
[1:36:18] this in their imaginations
[1:36:20] Lord don't let them keep in their
[1:36:22] imaginations well this brother walked
[1:36:24] right by me or this sister walked by by
[1:36:26] me maybe they had to get somewhere
[1:36:28] quickly right right maybe something like
[1:36:31] that you know what that's called giving
[1:36:32] people the benefit of the doubt every
[1:36:34] one of us want people to give the
[1:36:36] benefit of the doubt to us is that right
[1:36:40] everybody wants a pass you know when I
[1:36:42] taught school you had teachers that
[1:36:43] would hand out homework passes they
[1:36:45] would have them things man stacked up
[1:36:47] and it said pass p a s pass if you got
[1:36:50] so many things in you got a a pass and
[1:36:53] that pass meant when you had forgotten
[1:36:56] your homework well more than likely you
[1:36:58] chose I got a pass I got four more of
[1:37:00] these I can afford to just you know
[1:37:02] slide on this assignment and when it
[1:37:05] came time to hand in that assignment
[1:37:07] instead of handing in the typew written
[1:37:09] paper or handwritten paper you handed
[1:37:11] them a sheet maybe it was on blue paper
[1:37:13] pink paper yellow paper but it had pass
[1:37:15] and it looked like a ticket and you know
[1:37:17] what there was that pass was I'm not
[1:37:20] going to hold you accountable or mark
[1:37:22] this against you let me tell you
[1:37:24] something there's no greater pass than
[1:37:27] the Passover himself there's no greater
[1:37:30] pass than the Holy Spirit and this is
[1:37:33] why friends the refilling of the Holy
[1:37:35] Ghost not just to be filled with the
[1:37:38] Holy Ghost but to have a refilling that
[1:37:41] is loading your pockets with passes
[1:37:45] because we're going to have to give out
[1:37:46] passes I'm going to need passes please
[1:37:49] load your pockets because I'm going to
[1:37:51] need passes from you you're going to
[1:37:53] need passes from
[1:37:59] me I got to I got to move on
[1:38:10] here it's either captivity or Liberty
[1:38:13] right when God God speaks to Israel
[1:38:16] right here when they're coming back into
[1:38:19] the land from Babylon and he's letting
[1:38:20] them know this is what I want you to do
[1:38:23] cuz they were asking should we fast the
[1:38:24] fifth month should we do this on the
[1:38:26] seventh month and God said he let him
[1:38:28] know Zechariah 7 Zechariah 8 all the
[1:38:31] fasting you done in Babylon wasn't
[1:38:33] nothing about me it was all about you
[1:38:38] right wow that's what God told him wow
[1:38:41] and this is what he goes on to say this
[1:38:44] is what I'm asking of you because this
[1:38:46] is what caused them to be taken away you
[1:38:48] look at it we say well they rejected the
[1:38:50] word they rejected the prophets that's
[1:38:51] right the prophets were trying to to
[1:38:53] call them back to the character that God
[1:38:58] desired of them remember Israel was
[1:38:59] called yesun right that was their
[1:39:02] character the eyed to character that God
[1:39:04] saw within them and was calling them
[1:39:06] back you're not hitting the mark and
[1:39:08] they finally they kept on no you're not
[1:39:09] getting in my business you're not doing
[1:39:11] this you're not doing that and
[1:39:12] eventually from there withholding from
[1:39:14] the word they were LED away in
[1:39:18] captivity and this is where God says
[1:39:21] speak every man the truth to his
[1:39:23] neighbor
[1:39:24] in other words speak
[1:39:27] truth speak just be be honest with them
[1:39:31] brother Bill's with me and brother bill
[1:39:32] says let me tell you something You' seen
[1:39:33] this brother this brother this Hey
[1:39:35] Brother Bill let's pray for that brother
[1:39:38] instead of running them down let's pray
[1:39:39] for him instead of talking about him
[1:39:41] let's let's pray for him now now if I go
[1:39:43] away from there and say can you believe
[1:39:45] brother
[1:39:46] Bill he should be an
[1:39:49] elder and here he was he's nothing but
[1:39:52] flesh that's not an excuse but because
[1:39:55] there's something there within him it'll
[1:39:58] respond to the word that's what we need
[1:40:00] to do speak
[1:40:02] truth speak truth that's also we could
[1:40:05] go all the way through the New Testament
[1:40:06] with that how the Lord Jesus spoke on
[1:40:08] how that we're to work with one another
[1:40:09] when we see wrong execute in other words
[1:40:12] execute the Judgment of Truth and peace
[1:40:16] in your
[1:40:18] Gates and let none of you imagine in
[1:40:21] your hearts evil against his neighbor
[1:40:25] love no false oath for all these things
[1:40:28] are things that I hate sayeth the Lord
[1:40:31] wow so we got to stay Sanctified friends
[1:40:33] we got to keep Sanctified washing of
[1:40:36] Water by the word Lord listen friends
[1:40:38] let me tell you listen this is why the
[1:40:40] prophet tells us he said if you don't
[1:40:41] stay in his presence that's where you
[1:40:43] can get
[1:40:45] sticky and prickly and things catch
[1:40:48] that's the
[1:40:50] truth true this is why the scripture
[1:40:53] said let not sin therefore rain in your
[1:40:56] mortal body don't let it exercise a
[1:40:58] kingly Domin Don't Let It Rain don't let
[1:41:00] it find its place and and and find
[1:41:02] somewhere in your life yeah yeah I've
[1:41:04] seen them do this before I've seen no
[1:41:05] don't let it rain it doesn't matter if
[1:41:07] it's even true if you entertain it it
[1:41:10] will spoil your life some things we can
[1:41:14] imagine we've all been there we can
[1:41:16] think oh brother so and so maybe he
[1:41:18] hadn't responded texting uh how did I
[1:41:20] get here texting sometimes you you know
[1:41:23] there's times I have learned as a pastor
[1:41:25] it's time to call don't
[1:41:29] text because sometimes I've been
[1:41:31] misunderstood with texting texting it
[1:41:34] because you know why you don't see me
[1:41:36] you don't hear my voice you don't see
[1:41:37] the expression listen texting can never
[1:41:40] replace that person to person and
[1:41:44] sometimes that's the wisdom we have to
[1:41:45] have wait a minute this just merits in
[1:41:48] person so that it doesn't give the enemy
[1:41:51] uh things inroads to read in
[1:41:55] to it's like somebody starting out you
[1:41:57] know with a email and they tap type all
[1:42:00] in capital letters they thought we're
[1:42:02] going to make it so everybody can read
[1:42:04] it capital letters means you're yelling
[1:42:06] at
[1:42:09] them let me tell you one on my
[1:42:11] mom when my mom started texting you know
[1:42:14] she got her phone and she started
[1:42:16] texting some years ago you know these
[1:42:18] acronyms I can't even keep up with all
[1:42:19] of them now but you know my brother was
[1:42:22] telling her serious needs or you know
[1:42:24] things to pray for within you know as
[1:42:26] far as the family so and so sick and so
[1:42:28] and so's not feeling well and this and
[1:42:29] that and my mom you know after pray
[1:42:32] after that my mom was sending back bold
[1:42:34] or capital letters LOL and these were my
[1:42:37] brother got to look and he said why when
[1:42:39] I'm mentioning events like this it just
[1:42:42] doesn't seem to fit these are serious
[1:42:44] events and she's typing LOL you know
[1:42:46] what he said he said I I think I'm
[1:42:49] wondering what it is that Mom thinks
[1:42:51] that is so he text my mom this was the
[1:42:53] right way he could have got an attitude
[1:42:56] and said how could she think that way
[1:42:58] about
[1:43:01] me she's up there with Samuel and the
[1:43:04] devil right on the shoulder yeah she's
[1:43:06] right up there with Samuel doing this
[1:43:08] for him doing that for him doing that
[1:43:10] for him and look at you boy down here in
[1:43:15] Tennessee but he instead he asked
[1:43:20] her what did you mean by LOL
[1:43:24] love you
[1:43:25] lots or she said say it again what was
[1:43:28] it Kim oh lots of love lots of love lots
[1:43:32] of love that's what she thought LOL
[1:43:34] meant lots of love instead LOL laugh out
[1:43:38] loud some of you'll be laughing from now
[1:43:40] on when you send that
[1:43:42] acronym lots of
[1:43:44] love what are you saying brother Samuel
[1:43:47] that there's times we have and we will
[1:43:49] misunderstand one another that's why we
[1:43:51] need God's grace
[1:43:54] we need to live from the grace of God oh
[1:43:56] like David said God keep this in their
[1:44:00] imagination what a willingness to
[1:44:03] forgive a willingness to let go because
[1:44:06] it will only hinder you and hinder the
[1:44:08] Christ in your
[1:44:10] life this is why the scripture said love
[1:44:13] thanketh no evil the word thanketh means
[1:44:16] it doesn't keep any account of in other
[1:44:19] words let me go to my file cabinet on
[1:44:21] you cuz I've got records on you and
[1:44:24] those records date clear back to this
[1:44:27] and this and this and this and this you
[1:44:29] better be careful because you have no
[1:44:31] business tampering in the blood of Jesus
[1:44:36] Christ oh brother Samuel I've seen
[1:44:38] something that seemed like it kind of a
[1:44:40] little Glimpse that reminded me back
[1:44:42] there when they were a teenager before
[1:44:44] God ever did something in their life
[1:44:46] that's called character but when the
[1:44:48] Holy Ghost has come in their life and
[1:44:50] align them with the word that life with
[1:44:53] in them is what will mold that character
[1:44:56] and take the rough edges out of their
[1:44:58] life because you've got rough edges I've
[1:45:01] got rough edges are you with me
[1:45:03] now just CU what ends up happening is it
[1:45:05] doesn't end up hurting nobody else you
[1:45:07] see what happens is it'll hurt you
[1:45:09] because eventually it'll go to you and
[1:45:11] your family and it's just you and your
[1:45:12] family instead of setting right here you
[1:45:15] you and your wife instead of setting
[1:45:17] among a body of Believers you've got
[1:45:19] your little portion
[1:45:21] segment it's called a block of
[1:45:24] offense we're at this block of
[1:45:27] offense let me tell you there ain't
[1:45:29] going to be no blocks like that in
[1:45:31] heaven that's why those things have to
[1:45:33] get settled down here right now well
[1:45:36] brother Samuel they never asked me to
[1:45:37] forgive them they don't have to ask you
[1:45:39] to forgive them your duty as a Believer
[1:45:42] is to forgive them the scripture says
[1:45:44] over and over it says let us forgive one
[1:45:48] another even
[1:45:50] as God has forgiven us for ch Christ
[1:45:53] sake is that scripture is that scripture
[1:45:57] sometimes we hold those things for an
[1:45:59] excuse Oh Brother Willie said sorry but
[1:46:01] I'm still going to keep him in a prison
[1:46:03] remember the man who did that he begged
[1:46:06] boy I'm picking on you
[1:46:08] tonight maybe it's that red shirt you're
[1:46:10] with but you remember the boy you
[1:46:12] remember the man that came there to the
[1:46:13] king and the King said you owe me this
[1:46:15] many talents it was a lot of money and
[1:46:18] he came there and he oh no have mercy
[1:46:19] with me oh no have mercy with me I'll
[1:46:21] pay you back he went out of the presence
[1:46:23] of the king when compassion was given to
[1:46:25] him and he went over to somebody that
[1:46:27] owned him only 5
[1:46:29] pennies and said Pay Me You servant
[1:46:32] that's scripture yeah yeah and you know
[1:46:35] what the king heard about it yes he did
[1:46:38] and the King said because of that you
[1:46:41] will be thrown into prison until you pay
[1:46:44] the uttermost farling you know what you
[1:46:45] know what payment is is surrendering
[1:46:48] it that man would have to come to a
[1:46:51] place to surrender
[1:46:53] his own
[1:46:55] will or else he would be in a prison
[1:46:58] it's like people they put on house
[1:46:59] arrest I don't care where they go
[1:47:01] there's certain things they can't do
[1:47:03] right cuz they're on house arrest if
[1:47:05] they leave the house it's monitored
[1:47:07] right why it's like of being in a prison
[1:47:09] without having bars there that's the
[1:47:12] same way friends in offense is
[1:47:13] bitterness is malice is that's the same
[1:47:15] way in imagination that's the same way
[1:47:18] that these things are it becomes an
[1:47:20] offense you might ask what does this
[1:47:23] have to do with
[1:47:24] job glad you
[1:47:27] asked because
[1:47:29] job
[1:47:31] thought that his whole
[1:47:33] suffering was his God doing it that's
[1:47:37] right that's what
[1:47:39] Satan had made him to
[1:47:42] believe he showed him so many
[1:47:48] things but job hopefully we'll get to it
[1:47:51] in sometime
[1:47:52] when job finally had a meeting with
[1:47:55] God God let him know I was with you the
[1:47:59] whole time watching over you and in the
[1:48:02] words of the Prophet I was making
[1:48:05] something out of you right the whole
[1:48:09] time so what job
[1:48:13] imagined what Satan had whispered to him
[1:48:17] was not
[1:48:19] real job had all the arguments I've read
[1:48:21] to you scriptures here now it's almost
[1:48:23] for a year I've been on this with job
[1:48:25] 23 arguments after
[1:48:29] arguments listen friends I don't want to
[1:48:32] present no arguments I don't want I
[1:48:34] don't want arguments I don't want
[1:48:36] reasons of why that oh I can't
[1:48:37] fellowship with this brother I can't F I
[1:48:39] don't want I don't want arguments amen
[1:48:42] because you know what that is when those
[1:48:44] things are held listen let me just tell
[1:48:45] you this right now the prophet said if
[1:48:47] you've got one grudge against one person
[1:48:50] you're in danger of Health
[1:48:55] fire That's How Strong this
[1:48:58] is I don't want listen I don't want to
[1:49:01] miss the Rapture for
[1:49:03] nothing every one of us I'm standing
[1:49:05] here preaching to you of things that
[1:49:07] look that I can I could look at and take
[1:49:09] of an imagination here I am in a meeting
[1:49:12] and I'm in a meeting but I'm not even on
[1:49:15] the group thread of the minister in that
[1:49:17] meeting to let me know where to go when
[1:49:20] to show up when to do that you think
[1:49:22] that the devil didn't get I'm just
[1:49:23] preaching real you think the devil
[1:49:25] didn't get on my shoulder ah you know
[1:49:28] what it is they trying to exclude you
[1:49:32] because there's certain things of way
[1:49:33] you're
[1:49:35] standing brother Samuel what did you do
[1:49:38] it could seem very real of how could
[1:49:40] have been left
[1:49:41] out I don't know when certain things are
[1:49:44] going on when to show up for certain
[1:49:46] things cuz that becomes an easy thing I
[1:49:48] could I could have taken that but you
[1:49:50] know what I look to the Lord I'm not
[1:49:53] saying this to put me up I'm saying this
[1:49:55] right here cuz it didn't mean that
[1:49:56] there's not a sting sometimes when you
[1:49:58] feel things you know how it is when you
[1:49:59] feel like you've been left out of
[1:50:02] something anybody else feel that way
[1:50:04] sometimes you felt that
[1:50:06] way but I said
[1:50:10] Lord if it was intentional then I
[1:50:13] forgive him but I don't believe it was
[1:50:16] or brother Samuel it pro no I don't know
[1:50:19] that neither am I going to use
[1:50:22] discernment
[1:50:23] to put it there because that kind of
[1:50:25] discernment listen friends I've been
[1:50:27] around that those types of things before
[1:50:29] where people oh I tell you what I know
[1:50:30] so and so what I watch is not so and so
[1:50:32] I watch the person talking to me of the
[1:50:34] so-called discernment they have and I
[1:50:37] watch how it affects in their behavior
[1:50:39] and that's how I know whether it's
[1:50:41] coming from God or
[1:50:43] not are you hearing me this is how we
[1:50:46] check it's not about somebody else it's
[1:50:48] about us examining our own lives with
[1:50:51] the word of God because let me let me
[1:50:52] just say it like this even if it would
[1:50:54] be true so what it's not worth my spirit
[1:51:00] becoming affected because the enemy
[1:51:03] knows if I can just get him affected
[1:51:05] it'll affect him when it would come time
[1:51:07] for him to
[1:51:08] minister he won't be able to be there in
[1:51:11] study and prayer it'll be upon his mind
[1:51:13] but you know what you know what that is
[1:51:15] that's not the strength of Samuel
[1:51:16] Browning that's one of those
[1:51:18] passes it's passes if there's one thing
[1:51:20] we want to have I know we don't carry
[1:51:22] change no more if there's one thing we
[1:51:23] want to have we want to have a pocket
[1:51:25] full of
[1:51:26] passes is that what your prayer is and
[1:51:29] how do we have those passes is by
[1:51:31] staying in the presence of the Holy
[1:51:32] Spirit staying Sanctified let's
[1:51:37] stand my my
[1:51:44] my watch how brother Bram says this in
[1:51:46] the message humble
[1:51:48] thyself though I understand all the
[1:51:50] mysteries of God and still though I
[1:51:52] could do it and have not charity I'm
[1:51:54] nothing I haven't gotten nowhere yet see
[1:51:57] the main thing is love God and humble
[1:51:59] yourself with it brother BR said surely
[1:52:02] after all these years on the field and
[1:52:04] around the world and seeing different
[1:52:05] people I ought to know a little
[1:52:06] different about the gate to enter in at
[1:52:09] and if you want to get somewhere with
[1:52:10] God how many want to get somewhere with
[1:52:12] God I I I want to get I want to get
[1:52:14] closer to him I I want to get somewhere
[1:52:17] never let an arrogant Spirit ever come
[1:52:21] around you to to me I these words when
[1:52:24] when this is wrote in this way and
[1:52:25] spoken this way I think what I think
[1:52:27] back to is when Nehemiah stood there and
[1:52:30] the gates were constructed again in the
[1:52:33] same place the wall was built up and
[1:52:36] sister Carmen those people of the land
[1:52:38] that had nothing to do with the Jews
[1:52:42] wanted to come in and sell fish on the
[1:52:45] Sabbath day and Nehemiah said you're not
[1:52:48] coming inside of these Gates and selling
[1:52:51] fish on the Sabbath day and furthermore
[1:52:54] I better not catch you around the walls
[1:52:56] of the city
[1:52:58] either you're not to be around here and
[1:53:02] Trouble the day of
[1:53:04] rest that's what the Holy Spirit comes
[1:53:07] to minister to our lives and as we abide
[1:53:11] within that abiding within that look
[1:53:13] don't don't let an arrogant spirit that
[1:53:15] means if if if this says don't let an
[1:53:17] arrogant Spirit ever come around you
[1:53:19] guess what it means an arrogant spirit
[1:53:21] will sure try to come
[1:53:25] around and it'd be like sitting out here
[1:53:28] on a night and trying to kill one
[1:53:31] mosquito and think you'll not get bit
[1:53:34] good luck there's enough mosquitoes that
[1:53:37] could pack you
[1:53:39] away what are you saying brother Samuel
[1:53:41] it'll keep
[1:53:44] coming this is where our strength is our
[1:53:46] strength is oh I'm not going to let no
[1:53:47] arrogant Spirit I'm not going to let
[1:53:49] that that's not how God brings his word
[1:53:51] but here's our strength strength is
[1:53:53] staying in his
[1:53:56] presence it makes us flexible to where
[1:54:00] we're able to yield and push things out
[1:54:02] not allowing it to reside in our life
[1:54:04] whether it's an imagination or whether
[1:54:07] it's
[1:54:09] true I don't want it
[1:54:12] there that's my brother that's my sister
[1:54:14] Lord this is part of the same
[1:54:18] body don't let No Malice come in
[1:54:23] I knew I knew because of what you did I
[1:54:26] knew that was going to happen I knew
[1:54:28] don't don't let No Malice come
[1:54:31] in no matter what anybody has done if
[1:54:35] they are say it with me WR
[1:54:39] wrong deface them I don't know how you
[1:54:42] do that on Facebook or
[1:54:44] whatever or insta slap or whatever you
[1:54:46] do if they are wrong don't you never
[1:54:50] build up a complex against that
[1:54:54] person because you know why that's
[1:54:58] possible you don't have to go to Manards
[1:55:00] to get the material to build a complex
[1:55:03] there's Parts within our life already we
[1:55:05] come here in these other two parts it's
[1:55:07] just like material that's on the ground
[1:55:09] ready to
[1:55:09] go right it's like when they dump them
[1:55:11] at the home sites there there they are
[1:55:13] already con the things constructed the
[1:55:15] 2x4s and materials there right
[1:55:19] right you be sweet and kind
[1:55:23] remember God loved you when you were in
[1:55:28] sin I me remember
[1:55:31] that and not just when I was out there
[1:55:33] but how many times I've been wrong and
[1:55:34] he still he loved me amen and if the
[1:55:38] spirit of God is in you you love the
[1:55:40] other person when he's in the wrong just
[1:55:43] pray for him and love one
[1:55:44] another I say if there's anything Lord

[1:56:09] them who's already opened their hearts
[1:56:12] through their self-will has denied their
[1:56:14] own will and has come to know your
[1:56:18] will remember when John was in prison
[1:56:22] when John was in
[1:56:25] prison Jesus never had to send him a
[1:56:27] book down there this is how you
[1:56:31] behave he said go tell
[1:56:34] John just stay around tell him what you

[1:56:49] ministering of the word this is why we
[1:56:51] need staying in prayer see everything

[1:58:19] his presence stay in his presence

[1:58:25] Dew that's falling of a morning how many
[1:58:29] know like the past month man that D is
[1:58:31] so thick out there the morning you walk

[1:58:39] time but you know that do you don't hear
[1:58:42] it I never heard a I heard the rain but
[1:58:44] I never heard the de but the D will just

[2:12:47] years ago it's probably been now I think
[2:12:49] maybe my mind maybe eight years ago or
[2:12:52] so 7 years ago 8 years ago I preached on
[2:12:56] a series on forgiveness went through and
[2:12:58] studied a lot of things remember brother
[2:12:59] Bram points out certain things from
[2:13:01] people whole grudges and forgiveness you
[2:13:03] realize I don't know if some of you
[2:13:05] remember this when I read it to you that
[2:13:07] before they actually go to start
[2:13:08] treating cancer patients they want to
[2:13:11] know is there any Grudge in your
[2:13:14] life Wow because they said if there's
[2:13:17] anything there the medicine won't work
[2:13:21] now if medical science is finding this
[2:13:25] out God is before Medical
[2:13:29] Science and we want that word to work
[2:13:32] cuz the word Works doesn't it the word
[2:13:34] is powerful the word works there's
[2:13:36] nothing wrong with the word it's where
[2:13:38] we say Lord just search me search me if
[2:13:41] there's anything that's hindering the
[2:13:43] word from working search it out Lord
[2:13:46] amen because that's our
[2:13:48] desire the surrender that we have
[2:13:52] amen and I'll tell you what that takes
[2:13:54] real men and women that takes real sons
[2:13:57] and daughters of
[2:13:59] God you might not think that what you
[2:14:01] could look at in your life as being a
[2:14:03] Jericho but I want you to remember
[2:14:06] Jericho taking Jericho was a life in the
[2:14:09] Holy
[2:14:11] Ghost not be not not before the Holy
[2:14:14] Ghost it was after the Holy Ghost had
[2:14:16] come AI was a journey of a life in the
[2:14:20] Holy Ghost
[2:14:22] it's the same way the Holy Spirit works
[2:14:24] with our
[2:14:26] lives we don't come into the promised
[2:14:28] land and there's just nothing to do you
[2:14:29] just sit down in the promised land no
[2:14:31] now there's cities to take there's land
[2:14:35] to take your possession to
[2:14:38] take and I don't know about you but I
[2:14:40] want to be like that that prayer you
[2:14:42] know they got all over bookstores we
[2:14:43] don't have bookstores anymore but that
[2:14:44] book stores it's everywhere plaques
[2:14:47] everywhere I'm not against the plaques
[2:14:49] and all that but you know what when when
