[31:12] jesus precious
[31:15] amen
[31:16] you love him
[31:18] let's go to the book of daniel if you
[31:20] would
[31:23] go to jan daniel chapter 6.
[31:33] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[31:41] daniel chapter 6 and i want to just
[31:43] we'll read a few verses of scripture
[31:45] then we'll let you have your seats
[31:48] daniel verse 1
[31:51] 6 and verse 1. it pleased darius to set
[31:53] over the kingdom
[31:55] 120 princes
[31:57] which should be over the whole kingdom
[32:00] and over these three presidents of whom
[32:02] daniel was first
[32:04] that the princes might give accounts
[32:07] unto them
[32:08] and the king should have no damage
[32:11] then this daniel was preferred above the
[32:14] presidents and princes
[32:16] because an excellent spirit
[32:18] was in him
[32:20] and the king thought to set him over
[32:23] the whole realm
[32:25] then the presidents and princes sought
[32:28] to find occasion
[32:30] against daniel concerning the kingdom
[32:33] that they could find no occasion nor
[32:35] fault
[32:36] for as much as he was faithful
[32:39] neither was there any error or fault
[32:42] found in him
[32:44] in verse 5 then said these men
[32:47] we shall not find any occasion against
[32:49] this daniel
[32:51] except we find it against him concerning
[32:54] the law of his god
[32:56] then these presidents and princes
[32:59] assembled together to the king and said
[33:01] thus unto him
[33:03] king darius live forever
[33:05] and the presidents of the kingdom the
[33:08] governors the princes and the
[33:10] councillors and the captains have
[33:12] consulted together to establish a royal
[33:15] statute
[33:16] and to make a firm decree
[33:19] that whosoever shall ask a petition
[33:22] of any god or man for thirty days save
[33:24] of the o king he shall be cast into the
[33:27] den of lions
[33:29] now o king establish the decree
[33:32] and sign the writing that it be not
[33:34] changed
[33:35] according to the law of the and persians
[33:38] which altereth not
[33:40] wherefore king darius signed the writing
[33:43] and the decree
[33:45] now when daniel knew that the writing
[33:48] was signed i want you just to hone in on
[33:50] this verse here
[33:51] now when daniel knew that the writing
[33:54] was signed
[33:55] he went into his house
[33:57] and his windows being open in his
[34:00] chamber toward jerusalem
[34:02] he kneeled upon his knees three times a
[34:05] day and prayed and gave thanks before
[34:08] his god
[34:10] as he did
[34:11] a four time
[34:13] it didn't matter what changed in the
[34:15] kingdom
[34:16] daniel won't change it
[34:19] it didn't matter what was going on
[34:21] daniel said
[34:22] god's word doesn't change
[34:24] i'm a part of that word i'm not changing
[34:28] so i'd like to speak to you tonight on
[34:30] just one simple word
[34:32] unaltered unaltered may god bless
[34:36] the reading of the word as you're being
[34:37] conceived
[34:40] just some
[34:41] weeks ago months ago i remember exactly
[34:44] when actually it's probably been just
[34:45] about a month
[34:47] just in devotions
[34:49] one morning just
[34:51] struck me certainly didn't know that i'd
[34:53] be preaching on it
[34:55] at this time
[34:56] but it struck me when i
[34:59] came across this last part of the
[35:01] scripture there in verse 10
[35:04] of how that when there was a writing
[35:07] that was made
[35:09] how that daniel
[35:11] he made an approach
[35:13] and when daniel
[35:15] went about everything
[35:17] he never he never
[35:19] stopped he never altered
[35:21] anything
[35:22] about his walk with god not his life
[35:25] never altered one bit
[35:28] anyway look at that word unaltered
[35:30] that's a it's a very challenging word
[35:32] because it's nothing that we could ever
[35:36] really tack onto humanity
[35:39] because with humanity
[35:41] we
[35:42] we change
[35:44] even as we grow older we change you know
[35:47] you can as much as you want to dig your
[35:49] heels in and you know i'm gonna do this
[35:51] and i'm not gonna lose my hair i'm not
[35:53] gonna we we change there's there's parts
[35:56] about it that shows in our humanity
[35:59] itself that it's it's it's a fading away
[36:02] there's a dying that takes place we we
[36:05] find ourselves with not the strength
[36:07] maybe that we had even in previous years
[36:09] and i know some of you are looking at me
[36:10] and saying you're 46 years old right now
[36:12] but you you understand that when some of
[36:15] those times of certain things that you
[36:17] know we we just find that the dying and
[36:20] that that altering apart of certain
[36:22] things that we've even had to alter were
[36:23] certain things that maybe you could do
[36:25] in the past instead now you call
[36:27] somebody else to do it
[36:29] what's happened there's a changing
[36:30] that's taking place
[36:32] but to to your life as a believer
[36:35] there's one thing that doesn't change
[36:38] and that is the word of god
[36:40] that is your experience because your
[36:42] experience
[36:44] with the holy ghost
[36:46] that can't be altered
[36:48] that cannot be changed that's solid
[36:51] that's rock solid that's that's the part
[36:54] of the new birth that can never
[36:56] be altered in our life no matter what
[36:59] comes or what goes
[37:00] it is steadfast in our life remember
[37:03] when jesus when he was expressing in
[37:06] that time
[37:07] and you know you remember when he was
[37:08] asking who do men say that i am and they
[37:11] said some say you know you're this
[37:13] you're that you know you're this one
[37:14] what it was was all parts of christ that
[37:16] they were seeing and they were
[37:18] identifying he is identified with
[37:20] jeremiah with isaiah but in reality he
[37:24] was all of them put together
[37:26] it was god who had been revealing
[37:28] himself down through time and remember
[37:30] what he spoke to peter in that time he
[37:33] said that upon this rock i will build my
[37:37] church and the gates of hell shall not
[37:40] be able to prevail against it and how
[37:42] many times we hear brother branham will
[37:44] take it in the simplicity and he says
[37:46] see it shows that the gates of hell
[37:49] would be against it it would it would
[37:52] actually the teachings and everything
[37:54] else would a challenge the word of god
[37:57] so the challenge that satan wants to try
[38:01] to present to you and i is a challenge
[38:04] against the word of god because in our
[38:06] lives we face things that people who
[38:10] don't even believe in god they face the
[38:12] same things
[38:13] there's people who lose their jobs that
[38:15] don't believe in god and there's people
[38:17] who lose their job who do believe in god
[38:20] but there comes there comes to the sort
[38:23] separates to that of a believer is that
[38:25] the test that comes to our life is
[38:28] whether that we are going to stay with
[38:31] the word you know it's easy when there's
[38:34] no pressure that comes on around us of
[38:37] where whether we're going to stand with
[38:39] the word and let me just say this satan
[38:41] knows he knows our weaknesses brother
[38:44] bran tells us in a short message at the
[38:47] end of 62 the message the contest satan
[38:50] studies to find to see where is that
[38:53] word out in our life where is the word
[38:55] is it in our flesh is it only in our
[38:57] spirit or is it down there in our soul
[39:01] because where is it that we're because
[39:03] when it comes down to that of the soul
[39:05] then it comes to a place that of as to
[39:08] the believer we realize our life we're
[39:11] not living by bread alone we're living
[39:13] by every word of god and it's not just
[39:15] what we realize it's what we must have
[39:18] in our life as a believer when tests are
[39:21] trials or things come about in our life
[39:24] not just when they come but even when
[39:26] they come in the times of opposition we
[39:29] know that our strength comes from the
[39:32] lord and there's no way that i can face
[39:35] this or face adversity i need the
[39:38] strength and the help of almighty god
[39:41] it's not just about when things are
[39:43] going good but it's when the test and
[39:45] the trial comes that's when it really
[39:48] displays a real believer and the real
[39:51] goods on the inside
[39:53] so we're talking about in the midst of
[39:55] it what a paradox that in the midst of a
[39:58] life god does a work the god who changes
[40:02] not whose word cannot be altered and
[40:04] that god comes and does a work in our
[40:07] life by the new birth that's unalterable
[40:10] and yet that life that is on the outside
[40:13] of that is a life that we spirits
[40:16] altering we experience change in our
[40:17] life just like changes in season and
[40:20] changes we go through certain tastes you
[40:22] have now colors of paint or colors of
[40:24] this all of those things changes but
[40:27] there's one thing about it in our life
[40:29] that doesn't change and it can't change
[40:31] because it's not a work of man it's a
[40:33] work of almighty god
[40:36] it's unaltered
[40:40] and i want to say it like this the holy
[40:41] ghost is unaltered in this hour
[40:45] no matter what man has tried to do tried
[40:48] to water it down bring it down to a
[40:50] handshake or just to name it and claim
[40:52] it it's unaltered
[40:54] it's undisputed he's the same almighty
[40:58] god
[40:58] he does the same things you know what
[41:00] this is this right here you say well
[41:03] that's that's the book of life and the
[41:05] lamb section within it but it's also a
[41:08] prophecy concerning that the same god
[41:11] that moved before back here in
[41:13] adversities is the same god that moves
[41:17] in our life as well it's a book of
[41:19] prophecy that we can expect and know him
[41:22] to be the same he's never diminished in
[41:25] power doesn't matter what's changed
[41:27] through the ages he is the unaltered one
[41:31] who is in our midst the word of god is
[41:34] unaltered the heavens and earth will
[41:36] pass away but my word shall never pass
[41:40] away
[41:41] as you know the gentleman said and
[41:43] brother branham will refer to it he said
[41:45] as the black brother said i would rather
[41:47] be standing he said upon the word of god
[41:50] then upon he said heaven or earth he
[41:53] said because they will pass away
[41:56] but there's one thing that can't pass
[41:58] away and that's the word of god what you
[42:01] and i are seeing all around us right now
[42:04] is a vesture that's upon the earth and
[42:08] just like a vesture whether it's my coat
[42:10] or your shirt eventually it gets holes
[42:13] in it it serves its purpose and it's
[42:15] gone there is a vesture upon this earth
[42:18] but remember the earth is a redeemable
[42:22] attribute of god that god began to deal
[42:25] with in the days of noah he called it to
[42:28] repentance baptized it in that of water
[42:31] and the blood was shed and dropped upon
[42:33] it to claim it back there at calvary and
[42:36] it is awaiting its fire baptism and you
[42:40] and i have already received it why it's
[42:43] fitting that we would receive it first
[42:45] because we are the ones that were made
[42:48] to rule upon this earth
[42:52] amen so god prepares before he repairs
[42:56] the finality of the earth
[42:58] god prepares the people that is going to
[43:01] occupy and to dwell for the meat shall
[43:04] inherit the earth
[43:06] so it's unalterable so the foundations
[43:09] of this earth are unaltered the found
[43:12] what do you say what are the foundations
[43:13] the foundations are established in
[43:16] hebrews 11 that the worlds were framed
[43:19] by the word of god so the foundations
[43:22] themselves
[43:24] are that of god's word so now what does
[43:26] god do god is going to take the earth
[43:29] right back into that place with the fire
[43:32] baptism where he'll cleanse it off there
[43:34] heading into the millennium and then
[43:36] after the millennium now comes then the
[43:39] future home the baptism of the holy
[43:41] ghost upon this earth and then you and i
[43:44] will dwell upon it in the future home to
[43:47] think how that god would bring all this
[43:49] together back to the foundation you see
[43:52] there's a foundation to come back to and
[43:54] that's the word of god that's why the
[43:56] word of god has meaning in your life
[43:59] because you are always a part of the
[44:01] word of god you might have tried to run
[44:04] from it your mind the devil might have
[44:05] gave you all kinds of excuses of why you
[44:08] can't do it or you're not a part of it
[44:10] but once you get a taste
[44:12] of the power of almighty god that moves
[44:15] upon your heart there's something that
[44:18] raises up on the inside and it presses
[44:21] beyond every lie every doubt and every
[44:24] darkness that's around what is it it's
[44:26] the unaltered god that's in our midst he
[44:29] said i'm god and i changed not i give
[44:32] the same experience the same power with
[44:35] the same deliverance i am unaltered in
[44:38] my ways i am that i am i am alpha and
[44:43] omega
[44:46] you see to be unaltered every one of us
[44:49] people
[44:50] we face pressure
[44:52] you face pressure there's always
[44:54] pressure that's around paul would write
[44:56] of that in romans 12
[44:58] be not conformed
[45:00] to this world
[45:02] right that's a pressure
[45:05] you know we think about it many times
[45:07] that
[45:08] uh
[45:09] our young people
[45:10] no matter how how
[45:12] young they are and how the ages at start
[45:14] they face pressure
[45:16] there's pressures that they face now
[45:19] i didn't face when i was their age
[45:21] this thing even because of the
[45:23] availability of different things that's
[45:24] out there
[45:25] and you realize in this hour we we can't
[45:28] if i can say it in this way put her head
[45:30] in the sand and say well i'm not going
[45:32] to have anything to do with all that no
[45:35] there's an unaltered source that's in
[45:38] our midst that can give victory over the
[45:40] internet
[45:42] there's an unaltered one that has given
[45:44] victory all the way down through time
[45:48] the holy ghost is the answer to every
[45:51] problem
[45:54] even when you stand there in your own
[45:56] life not knowing the answer but you know
[45:59] in whom you have believed and he is the
[46:01] answer
[46:03] and just as he has unfolded himself
[46:06] through his word and unfolded himself to
[46:08] you and in your life he will unfold
[46:10] himself in every situation and every
[46:13] trouble that comes your way because he's
[46:16] not the author of confusion
[46:19] he's an author with a purpose
[46:23] oh my things take us by surprise but
[46:25] never god that's right think of this
[46:28] here
[46:30] you know brother branham would talk to
[46:32] us in in the terran age of the age
[46:35] that age of that tyra there
[46:37] being that fourth age
[46:39] an age where
[46:41] you had
[46:42] here now things had moved into a place
[46:46] of that red horse rider that we read
[46:48] about in the book of revelations
[46:51] where the white horse had went forth and
[46:54] through innocency and and deception had
[46:57] moved in there to
[46:59] really work to break the power of the
[47:02] church of the living god
[47:04] and when he moved in you say how did he
[47:06] do that he substituted the real reality
[47:10] of the holy spirit in the lives of the
[47:12] people
[47:13] satan didn't care how much
[47:15] doctrine that they had he could just
[47:17] twist it a little bit then the word
[47:20] itself the word has been altered but yet
[47:24] the word remains the same
[47:26] so the word hasn't been altered it's
[47:29] man's idea
[47:31] the word hasn't changed that's where god
[47:33] would come in this generation that you
[47:35] and i are in god was not here on the
[47:38] platform each night and in the pews just
[47:40] to show off god's not just in your life
[47:43] or my life just to show off god is
[47:45] declaring through the message of the
[47:47] hour that i am the same god the word
[47:51] that i have spoken i am the same god
[47:55] there is nothing impossible with god
[48:00] god was declaring in this this hour in
[48:03] this age when superstitions and
[48:06] questions and remember when the gifts
[48:08] fell out there on azusa street
[48:10] supernatural returning back among the
[48:12] church of the living god but now
[48:15] the church begins to believe in the
[48:17] supernatural that's necessary because
[48:20] it's coming to a place of the greatest
[48:22] supernatural event that has ever struck
[48:25] the face of the earth it will take more
[48:28] than gifts but the gifts will be with it
[48:30] in this restoring and the placing of it
[48:32] in the word but the holy spirit would
[48:35] come in its fullness to do what prepare
[48:38] a bride for rapture where the church has
[48:41] put questions on the word but god has a
[48:44] royal seed upon this earth that the holy
[48:48] spirit has sought out and their heart is
[48:51] calling out for an unaltered god an
[48:54] unaltered word i don't want to wear it
[48:56] with compromise i want a god who is the
[48:59] amen of the word
[49:02] hallelujah
[49:04] unaltered
[49:06] unaltered
[49:08] pressure comes
[49:11] but the scripture said be not conformed
[49:14] to this world
[49:15] god told him in the thytaran age it was
[49:17] a dark age
[49:19] the the
[49:20] the pressure brother graham says it's
[49:22] simple like this it was either bend
[49:25] or be broken
[49:29] there was a coalition that came along in
[49:32] order
[49:33] to gain work it it'll apply for what's
[49:35] coming up on this earth in order to
[49:37] worship
[49:39] this is where everything's got to come
[49:40] about
[49:42] you see how everything is setting up
[49:43] right now
[49:45] we hear
[49:46] brethren deals with this
[49:48] and he talks about how
[49:50] communism coming in communism coming in
[49:52] remember brother adam he tells us over
[49:53] and over he says don't you watch and
[49:56] fear communism
[49:59] he said but you watch that purple
[50:00] curtain
[50:01] and brother adam comes around i you know
[50:03] probably i think was about a month ago i
[50:05] was there and listening to the message
[50:07] revelation book of symbols and and here
[50:09] i heard brother branham say of how that
[50:11] that coming in of communism it was only
[50:14] a set up for those to give themselves in
[50:18] for catholicism to take over look where
[50:20] we're at even right now
[50:23] look at even you find such the
[50:25] divisiveness it's safe and sowing hatred
[50:29] and division and everything else it's
[50:31] setting up a right place for that image
[50:35] of the beast to fully come into power
[50:38] because you're going to have people that
[50:40] they might have principles but they will
[50:42] relinquish their principles because they
[50:46] will say hey we can do better by just
[50:49] joining with catholicism
[50:53] see everything is coming it's it's all
[50:55] right in time it's all right in place
[50:57] we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[51:00] we would be if not for the grace of god
[51:04] if not for god's word that has come to
[51:06] us in this hour that's why as a believer
[51:09] god calls our lives to look beyond the
[51:12] things he says lift your head up when
[51:15] you see these things taking place
[51:18] it's bringing the people into a place to
[51:21] where even though they don't agree with
[51:23] one another remember the ram tells us in
[51:25] the message shalom he says it's darkest
[51:27] before the breaking of day and the
[51:29] darkness is causing a congeeling of that
[51:32] time he said you've got them coming
[51:34] together and they don't even agree over
[51:37] doctrines
[51:40] and brother graham takes us into that
[51:41] place of the philadelphian age i will
[51:43] keep the in the hour of temptation we
[51:45] understand the mark of the beast it's
[51:47] already setting forth in the earth that
[51:50] whenever the holy ghost is rejected they
[51:52] take the mark but it's coming to that
[51:54] time we're moving into that moment when
[51:57] the bride is gone from here when that
[52:00] pressure comes down and there will be
[52:02] decisions that have to be made even then
[52:06] we're moving into those hours to where
[52:08] will lives be altered
[52:11] will they rest in an organization or
[52:13] will they see it at that time and say i
[52:15] don't want nothing to do with this
[52:17] because there is good people in there
[52:20] is that right
[52:21] there is but they will be given an
[52:23] opportunity to make their choice but you
[52:25] see it comes down to a place
[52:28] that there is something greater
[52:30] it shows theology can be altered
[52:34] man's ideas can be altered
[52:36] because every one of them they have
[52:38] their absolute
[52:39] but you see a real absolute is an
[52:42] absolute that can stand in the face of
[52:45] other absolutes and it's unmoved
[52:49] and there's victory within it it's life
[52:51] within it it reproduces the very life of
[52:55] jesus christ
[52:56] see brother brown would say it like this
[52:58] he says in that parent age i'm just
[53:00] going to refer to some of these places
[53:02] he says each age had its pressure every
[53:05] age every gentile church age remember
[53:09] god has been calling a bride out
[53:13] throughout these seven church ages
[53:16] we're living in the time of the finish
[53:20] there's not another message there's not
[53:21] another messenger there's not another
[53:23] time coming this we have arrived to the
[53:26] end of the end time
[53:29] we're here this is the finishing up of
[53:31] the mystery of god the capping off of a
[53:34] bride that which god had in his mind is
[53:37] now coming into fruition a bride that
[53:40] reflects jesus christ himself every age
[53:44] had its pressures
[53:46] well sometimes we can look at one
[53:48] another you know
[53:49] let me just say it let me just bring it
[53:51] home here to us even as ministers among
[53:53] the five different
[53:55] gifts you know and you know evangelists
[53:57] or a pastor can look at evangel say hi
[53:58] you know you don't have to put up with
[54:00] all you know just caring and things he's
[54:02] able to move here and drop this here and
[54:04] my go on and sing results there and sing
[54:06] results there and a teacher you know my
[54:08] you know a teacher
[54:10] everything is looks at but what we fail
[54:12] to recognize is is to understand just as
[54:15] every gift and every life we all have
[54:18] pressure
[54:20] we all have burdens
[54:22] there's not one thing you know the the
[54:24] greatest trick of the enemy is to put
[54:27] something like pie in the sky grass is
[54:29] greener on the other side
[54:31] it doesn't become easier
[54:34] lot thought life would be easier it
[54:36] didn't
[54:37] all he did he didn't leave church right
[54:39] away he just turned his tent door he
[54:42] simply was facing here where abraham and
[54:45] them were at all he did was uproot his
[54:47] stint tent stakes and just turned his
[54:49] tent around and dropped it he was no
[54:52] longer in a place of receiving from the
[54:56] word of god
[54:58] and because he turned himself notice
[55:01] what happened though right there in the
[55:03] camp where the vindicated word was at
[55:06] but yet the power of solomon by him
[55:09] looking at it focusing on it taking in
[55:11] it letting it come in the doors of his
[55:14] home the influences soon little by
[55:17] little by little by little eventually he
[55:19] was inside of the boundaries of sodom
[55:22] and in the city
[55:23] and became a mayor i wonder if
[55:25] lot probably thought when he became the
[55:27] mayor of the city man this is surreal
[55:28] wow i never imagined this would happen
[55:30] of course not
[55:32] but it happened right how did it happen
[55:34] little by little by little by little by
[55:36] little by little this is why don't lift
[55:39] up your tent stakes
[55:41] keep your door of your home of your
[55:43] family of your house of your life but
[55:45] the same as sometimes it's a it's a hard
[55:47] barren grant i i see a ground out there
[55:50] it looks like the garden of eden we're
[55:52] not here for things that look like we
[55:55] are promised in this our real true
[55:58] substance
[56:00] amen not impersonations but reality
[56:04] is that right
[56:07] oh my you know i'll never forget i had a
[56:08] man we had a man to come through when we
[56:10] first had built our house where where we
[56:12] where we did live
[56:14] and this guy came through and he had
[56:15] this hatchback car and you know uh and
[56:18] and
[56:19] he he came up to the door well you know
[56:21] we needed pictures at the time
[56:24] we did
[56:25] and you know you could only have ford
[56:27] you know how it is you put one picture
[56:29] on the wall you
[56:30] do a little bit here and wait for taxes
[56:32] come in put a little bit there you
[56:34] you understand what i'm saying
[56:36] and so you know
[56:37] he pulled up and he had these i think
[56:39] it's thomas kincaid in my i got that
[56:41] right these paintings like portraits of
[56:43] light and stuff and he had these things
[56:45] out there brother richie was trying to
[56:46] tell us oh i have some portraits i said
[56:49] what are they up i was tempted i'll be
[56:51] honest with you the thomas again man
[56:53] these things are beautiful i've seen
[56:54] them at the at the christian bookstore
[56:55] but you know it is christian bookstore
[56:57] to buy those paintings you have to have
[56:58] a mortgage document and sign it up
[57:01] i thought man this is beautiful
[57:03] how much aren't they 50
[57:05] i told my wife i said
[57:07] i was tempted
[57:08] i'll be honest with you i was tempted
[57:11] i said honey these things are
[57:12] counterfeit
[57:13] i said there ain't no way in the world
[57:15] he's hauling these around like this in
[57:17] his back of his car he had quite a few
[57:18] of them i said there ain't no way in the
[57:20] world i said either they're counterfeit
[57:22] or he stole them
[57:23] i said sir i appreciate that but we're
[57:25] not going to be able to buy any at this
[57:27] time
[57:29] a counterfeit you can sell it cheaply
[57:32] but the original cost a lot
[57:35] counterfeits can be bought out for
[57:37] cheapness
[57:38] but an original oh it's priceless that's
[57:41] why the original work of the holy ghost
[57:43] in a life it's priceless it can't be
[57:45] bought out
[57:47] it's unalterable
[57:49] each age had its pressure brother them
[57:51] talks about the pressure that we face in
[57:53] this age
[57:54] think about the great burden that we
[57:56] face in this age and he words it this
[57:58] way
[57:58] it's the pressure of riches
[58:01] it's the pressure for those who have
[58:02] riches it's the pressure for those who
[58:04] don't and are striving to get it's
[58:05] pressure all around
[58:07] i mean it's just like you know
[58:08] well let me go on it just you know you
[58:11] find
[58:12] soft living he said and nervous tensions
[58:15] in a complex age that we seem unfitted
[58:17] to live in
[58:20] it would be like if i gave my jacket to
[58:21] brother brian because i know he can't
[58:22] wear my jacket
[58:24] and brother brian tried to put on my my
[58:26] jacket
[58:27] he'd probably rip it
[58:30] and you'd look at it and you'd think
[58:32] man you know or it'd be like paul paul
[58:34] having his suit coat and paul giving me
[58:35] his suit coat you already are like no
[58:38] way buddy you got
[58:40] you need about 10 sizes bigger there
[58:42] why it's unfit for me
[58:45] that's how this age is to a real
[58:47] believer
[58:50] i want you to think of this
[58:51] even when god has done a real work in
[58:54] your life we still
[58:56] battle things
[58:58] we battle pressures
[59:00] anybody like suffering
[59:02] nobody does
[59:05] right
[59:06] nobody likes suffering
[59:09] the lord jesus himself prayed three
[59:12] times
[59:13] is that right
[59:15] identifying that part of humanity
[59:18] his humanity didn't want to suffer but
[59:20] his soul wanted to please and follow the
[59:24] word more than his flesh
[59:28] what won the battle
[59:30] if that word would have only been in his
[59:32] flesh the flesh would have won
[59:35] but the word was down there on the
[59:37] inside and the wired won the battle in
[59:41] the time when the wrestling match was
[59:44] going on
[59:48] oh my my my
[59:50] hallelujah even the babies amen and me
[59:52] on that one back there
[59:56] amen that's wonderful that don't bother
[59:58] me at all
[59:59] notice this soft living and nervous
[1:00:01] tensions and a complex age that we seem
[1:00:03] unfitted to live in
[1:00:05] i don't have to ask you sometimes how
[1:00:07] how those feelings and those pressures
[1:00:09] come about but i want to just say it
[1:00:10] like this every age has had its test
[1:00:14] and it's the test of the word in this
[1:00:16] age we're not tested
[1:00:18] with with the word that god gave to
[1:00:21] luther that's not the full test
[1:00:23] that comes to us that just shall live by
[1:00:26] faith
[1:00:26] but that's not the full test in this
[1:00:28] hour for the bride
[1:00:32] neither is it sanctification neither is
[1:00:34] it the working of the gifts it's the
[1:00:37] full word that has come in our midst and
[1:00:41] it is a full test of the word
[1:00:46] oh my
[1:00:47] now you see when we look at it the the
[1:00:50] tensions we see the world is responding
[1:00:54] this is why men's hearts are failing for
[1:00:56] fear
[1:00:58] this is why
[1:00:59] you know everything that's being given
[1:01:02] to people to calm them down raise them
[1:01:04] up put them to sleep and everything else
[1:01:07] all those things that are pressure and
[1:01:10] we sense the pressures even in these
[1:01:13] bodies
[1:01:15] we sense that at different times we
[1:01:17] sense fears at times
[1:01:20] come on the word spoke to us on sunday
[1:01:22] be not afraid and we rest in that word
[1:01:26] and remember there are times that fear
[1:01:28] comes but that's where we rely upon god
[1:01:31] and say lord
[1:01:33] i'm fearful this this situation is
[1:01:35] fearful but lord jesus you are my
[1:01:38] strength david said what time i am
[1:01:41] afraid i will call on god
[1:01:45] david said i ain't too big to let him
[1:01:46] know lord i'm afraid and i need to feel
[1:01:49] your feathers
[1:01:51] i need to feel the wings of the holy
[1:01:54] ghost
[1:01:56] amen that's the kind of people we want
[1:01:58] to be
[1:01:59] amen brother samuel ain't that altering
[1:02:02] not at all because we are united with
[1:02:05] the living god to know that whatever
[1:02:07] comes about
[1:02:09] he is the unaltered one
[1:02:11] he's the one that keeps us lined up when
[1:02:14] we get out of sync out of sorts he's the
[1:02:16] unaltered one and he's the one to line
[1:02:18] us up
[1:02:20] oh my let me let me just try to get here
[1:02:22] to a little place
[1:02:24] think of this the world
[1:02:27] they're facing these things now i want
[1:02:28] to just read some of these things
[1:02:30] regarding that of daniel
[1:02:32] you find this here
[1:02:34] brother brahm is talking about this here
[1:02:36] in daniel's time and he talks about in
[1:02:39] the message how can overcome
[1:02:40] there was four overcomers that could
[1:02:43] stand the test of fire
[1:02:45] and the lion
[1:02:47] brother brandon says now
[1:02:49] we're expected to be tested
[1:02:51] that's a good lesson for my brother back
[1:02:53] there he that cometh to god must first
[1:02:56] be
[1:02:57] tested
[1:02:58] the rem says tested
[1:03:00] with what with the word
[1:03:03] that's god's test
[1:03:05] he that cometh to god
[1:03:07] must
[1:03:08] be tested
[1:03:10] that only shows a true child
[1:03:14] see he can be tested and when the test
[1:03:16] comes on you can't overcome unless
[1:03:18] there's a test to give you and when a
[1:03:20] test is given it's to see whether you
[1:03:22] can overcome or not you know it'd be
[1:03:24] like mom or dad asking how was school
[1:03:25] there got an a really wow was that a pop
[1:03:28] quiz well nobody have a quiz
[1:03:31] you have a test no i got an a
[1:03:33] in their mind they got an a
[1:03:35] but the test
[1:03:37] shows whether you've been studying
[1:03:40] whether you've been paying attention
[1:03:42] that's what the test shows have you got
[1:03:44] the material to where not only can you
[1:03:46] identify the facts but be able to apply
[1:03:50] it in situations that are presented to
[1:03:52] you
[1:03:53] that's what the test does can you oh my
[1:03:56] can you apply it when situations are are
[1:03:59] put to you
[1:04:02] most of the situations or the tests that
[1:04:04] we face as believers it's not a b c or d
[1:04:07] and we say
[1:04:08] got to be c that's usually the majority
[1:04:10] of the answers right there true or false
[1:04:13] anybody got a coin t heads for true
[1:04:16] tails for fault no it don't work that
[1:04:17] way the tests that we come to require
[1:04:20] application
[1:04:23] can we and do we apply the grace that
[1:04:26] has been given to us the word that we've
[1:04:29] been hearing
[1:04:30] how god is dealing and moving in our
[1:04:33] life you see god when we come to
[1:04:35] services when you are out there your
[1:04:38] your personal walk with god these are
[1:04:40] not things that just they're taking up
[1:04:42] time
[1:04:43] this is god in stealing and putting his
[1:04:46] word into our heart he's
[1:04:48] god is speaking to us to bring change to
[1:04:51] our life there's things that you can set
[1:04:53] right here in the service and you may
[1:04:55] not in yourself feel any different but
[1:04:58] the word is transforming you
[1:05:02] and you find yourself then when
[1:05:04] situations arise it's god as you're
[1:05:06] taking that word in you know you don't
[1:05:08] stay you know if you here you were as a
[1:05:11] five-year-old boy let's just say in the
[1:05:12] lord you don't stay that way with eating
[1:05:14] on the word of god you grow and you
[1:05:17] mature
[1:05:19] and as you grow and you mature the
[1:05:21] things that were tested and tried upon
[1:05:24] when you were five years old you don't
[1:05:26] look at those as tests anymore
[1:05:29] but the things of your age of where
[1:05:31] you're at now we're tested upon
[1:05:33] right but the word
[1:05:36] matures us for that place
[1:05:40] notice that only shows a true child
[1:05:42] jesus said to him that overcometh the
[1:05:44] test the test is the greatest thing
[1:05:47] that ever happened to you
[1:05:49] the test is the greatest thing to ever
[1:05:51] happen to you
[1:05:53] let's watch out i believe it's written
[1:05:55] in the scripture peter said our trials
[1:05:57] are worth more to us than precious gold
[1:06:00] it's a testing time
[1:06:02] it's one good evidence how many of you
[1:06:05] want a good evidence god's with you
[1:06:08] i like those evidences don't you
[1:06:10] one good evidence it's one good evidence
[1:06:13] to us that god is with us when we're
[1:06:16] tested for all children of god are
[1:06:19] tested
[1:06:20] and tried
[1:06:22] man i thought everything's going to be a
[1:06:23] nice picnic
[1:06:25] nice big chocolate chip cookies with
[1:06:27] walnuts sticking up in
[1:06:29] sandwich just right where the bread
[1:06:32] having that lice lettuce and tomato no
[1:06:34] sauce i thought everything was going to
[1:06:36] be good we just
[1:06:37] we're not in a picnic
[1:06:39] somebody finish it for me we're not on a
[1:06:41] picnic we're in a
[1:06:42] a battle
[1:06:44] we're in a battle but you know what we
[1:06:46] learn to appreciate the times between
[1:06:49] the battles
[1:06:50] and you should rest between the battles
[1:06:54] as a matter of fact god appoints agents
[1:06:57] to care for you between the battles when
[1:07:00] the test had passed for the lord jesus
[1:07:02] what did the bible say angels came and
[1:07:04] ministered unto him
[1:07:05] when elijah was tested and after he was
[1:07:08] warned what did god do god sent angels
[1:07:11] to minister to elijah and not just any
[1:07:13] he called it the one that had the
[1:07:14] softest hand and he wanted the one that
[1:07:16] can make the best case
[1:07:18] is that right
[1:07:20] and he cared for elijah after elijah had
[1:07:23] made a stand or been tested in that hour
[1:07:27] then after the test and the test was
[1:07:30] passed
[1:07:31] god ministered to him
[1:07:34] you see it goes to show that our flesh
[1:07:36] look at the weakness how the lord jesus
[1:07:38] even coming through that his flesh there
[1:07:40] was weak weakened elijah weakened
[1:07:44] is that right the flesh was weakened
[1:07:47] here here is the test that's taking
[1:07:49] place
[1:07:50] it's it's breaking out it's in a battle
[1:07:53] of other realms
[1:07:55] to stand for that word to believe for
[1:07:57] that word there's pressures that want to
[1:08:00] come and come against that whether we're
[1:08:02] going to stand on that word or whether
[1:08:04] we're going to be altered or unaltered
[1:08:07] it's within let me say this clearly it's
[1:08:09] within our human nature
[1:08:12] to take the easy way
[1:08:15] nobody wants to be misunderstood nobody
[1:08:17] wants to be uh what's wrong with this
[1:08:19] guy nobody none of us i'm talking about
[1:08:21] a human nature i'm not talking about the
[1:08:23] new birth the new birth wants to stand
[1:08:26] on the word of god but the human nature
[1:08:28] part doesn't like to be misunderstood
[1:08:32] is that right
[1:08:34] even in that right there proves greater
[1:08:37] is he that's in you
[1:08:40] even in that right there
[1:08:42] so notice daniel here he was
[1:08:44] i just want to just let me wrap this
[1:08:46] these these up here daniel a man of
[1:08:48] prophet notice brother brown calls
[1:08:50] daniel and shadrach meshach
[1:08:52] and abednego
[1:08:54] he calls them the overcomers in that day
[1:08:57] the bride
[1:08:58] he said they weren't the church they
[1:09:00] were the bride
[1:09:01] there were millions down there in
[1:09:03] babylon
[1:09:05] but only
[1:09:06] the church of the living god was made up
[1:09:09] of four
[1:09:10] four overcomers
[1:09:12] remember
[1:09:13] when the bible says when
[1:09:16] here uh you know when the lord jesus
[1:09:18] went here life the the life had passed
[1:09:21] out of his body right and then how he
[1:09:24] himself rose on that easter morning the
[1:09:27] bible said many of those who slept not
[1:09:30] all many
[1:09:32] many not all in the old testament you
[1:09:35] say they were offering the lamb but were
[1:09:37] they offering it by revelation
[1:09:40] that's the difference you see when it's
[1:09:42] by revelation it's something from your
[1:09:45] heart that means more than anything else
[1:09:49] that's how you know when it's a real
[1:09:51] revelation it means more to you than
[1:09:54] anything else in your life
[1:09:59] it's not head knowledge it's not
[1:10:01] something that you have to do it's
[1:10:02] reality to you it means more to you and
[1:10:06] there's nothing that i will do to alter
[1:10:09] that
[1:10:14] oh my i tell you you go
[1:10:16] a million ways of sunday on that thought
[1:10:17] right there
[1:10:19] think about this
[1:10:20] that was the size of the overcomers them
[1:10:23] overcomers was put to the task
[1:10:26] and every overcomer has to be put to the
[1:10:29] test
[1:10:30] when they said you take back the word
[1:10:33] what the word says or be thrown in the
[1:10:35] fiery furnace they refused anything but
[1:10:38] the word
[1:10:40] when daniel was given the test i want to
[1:10:41] get to this place here when daniel was
[1:10:44] given the test that he should take back
[1:10:45] what the word said
[1:10:47] that they should lean towards the temple
[1:10:49] as solomon prayed and he would deliver
[1:10:51] them from all things god would hear from
[1:10:53] heaven if they'd look towards the temple
[1:10:55] and pray
[1:10:57] when you catch what brother brown says
[1:10:58] that that if daniel would take back he
[1:11:01] was tested
[1:11:02] would he take back from the word god had
[1:11:04] already
[1:11:06] given his word
[1:11:08] let me tell you about spiritual
[1:11:09] discernment
[1:11:10] because the enemy could have been there
[1:11:12] to talk to daniel and say
[1:11:13] you mean you're going to stand upon
[1:11:15] solomon
[1:11:17] his word you know what happened to his
[1:11:18] end don't you
[1:11:20] you know he got tied up with women right
[1:11:23] come on now this is scripture
[1:11:25] but you see it all showed that that
[1:11:27] perfection had not come they were all
[1:11:30] types of that perfect one that was to
[1:11:32] come
[1:11:33] are you with me but you see even in the
[1:11:36] midst of all that this is where
[1:11:38] spiritual discernment looks beyond the
[1:11:40] veil and recognizes this is not the word
[1:11:44] of a man it's the word of god because a
[1:11:47] man's word can be altered but god's word
[1:11:49] cannot be altered
[1:11:52] amen daniel could stand right there and
[1:11:55] say god has said that what he spoke out
[1:11:57] of his mouth he will not change it
[1:12:02] let somebody know where they're standing
[1:12:05] at
[1:12:05] standing on the word of god when daniel
[1:12:08] was given a test that he should take
[1:12:10] back the word now notice brother graham
[1:12:12] said they set a trap for him
[1:12:15] i believe that prophet knew that now i
[1:12:16] want you to just catch this here
[1:12:18] they set a trap for him
[1:12:21] and he said i believe daniel knew it
[1:12:25] they set a trap for him
[1:12:26] he walked humbly
[1:12:28] when it come time for him to pray he
[1:12:30] knowed at the home place in jerusalem
[1:12:33] there was a burning sacrifice on the
[1:12:35] altar
[1:12:36] daniel wasn't afraid
[1:12:39] of them spies
[1:12:41] he raised up the shades and threw back
[1:12:43] the shutters and knelt down on his knees
[1:12:46] and throwed his hand up to god and
[1:12:49] prayed
[1:12:50] now let me just say this to you daniel
[1:12:52] wasn't doing this because he was under
[1:12:54] the influence of others who didn't like
[1:12:56] what was going on in the kingdom
[1:12:58] are you hearing me
[1:13:00] because the bible's already said they
[1:13:02] tried to find occasion against him in
[1:13:04] the kingdom and they couldn't do it
[1:13:06] right
[1:13:06] just like on our jobs i mean look people
[1:13:09] know how to align with other people they
[1:13:11] they know who they can go to and be
[1:13:13] critical
[1:13:15] same thing in the church and on people
[1:13:17] they know it any people it's spirits
[1:13:20] it ain't
[1:13:21] spirits that work in those manners
[1:13:24] and they couldn't find anything
[1:13:27] concerning the kingdom
[1:13:29] they couldn't say hey daniel's not doing
[1:13:31] this daniel's not doing they couldn't
[1:13:32] find nothing
[1:13:34] he had a testimony he was walking in
[1:13:37] humility to the word of god and because
[1:13:40] of being in humility to the word of god
[1:13:42] whatever was asked of him to do by this
[1:13:46] by this by this that didn't come against
[1:13:48] the word daniel said they've been placed
[1:13:49] in authority over me i will do what
[1:13:51] they've asked me to do all right
[1:13:53] okay quiet
[1:13:54] that's scripture
[1:13:56] that's bible submit yourself and to
[1:13:58] ordinance of every man
[1:14:00] is that right so so we want to stay
[1:14:02] under the influence of the word and not
[1:14:04] get under the influence of the world
[1:14:06] right is that right this is where the
[1:14:08] battle and as it comes into in before
[1:14:11] you and i then they laid a trap they
[1:14:13] laid a trap for him and daniel knew it
[1:14:15] but notice remember god will never honor
[1:14:18] the wrong motive and the wrong objective
[1:14:21] things can be absolutely the right thing
[1:14:23] to do but god won't honor it if it's the
[1:14:26] wrong motive and wrong objective
[1:14:29] is that right
[1:14:30] but in daniel was found an excellent
[1:14:33] spirit
[1:14:35] his motive and objective
[1:14:38] remained pure daniel wasn't throwing up
[1:14:40] the windows and saying i'll tell you
[1:14:42] what they're ain't do you know what
[1:14:43] they're not going to tell me when i
[1:14:44] can't pray daniel said you know what
[1:14:47] daniel do you know this law has been
[1:14:49] passed
[1:14:50] yeah i heard about that what are you
[1:14:51] going to do today i'm going to do what i
[1:14:53] do every day
[1:14:54] what is that i'm gonna pray in the
[1:14:56] morning
[1:14:57] i'm gonna pray in the noon time and i'm
[1:14:59] gonna pray in the evening time
[1:15:01] but daniel look what's coming your way
[1:15:03] but daniel said that word right there
[1:15:06] that's coming it's there's been a change
[1:15:08] come in the kingdom but i'm part of
[1:15:10] another kingdom that can't be changed
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:13] it can't be it's unaltered so daniel
[1:15:16] wasn't doing it in defiance daniel said
[1:15:18] i'm going to keep on being daniel i'm
[1:15:21] going to keep on being a believer i'm
[1:15:23] going to keep on living for god i'm
[1:15:25] going to keep on standing for his word i
[1:15:28] i didn't choose to be here in babylon
[1:15:30] but god seemed fit that i would be here
[1:15:33] i didn't bring myself in favor before
[1:15:36] the king but it was god who gave me
[1:15:39] favor with different ones to come in to
[1:15:42] certain positions it was not my doing it
[1:15:45] was god's doing
[1:15:48] he knew where he was standing unaltered
[1:15:56] the ram said why
[1:15:58] he throwed up his hands and prayed to
[1:16:00] god
[1:16:01] why
[1:16:03] live or die
[1:16:05] he had the victory
[1:16:08] and therefore i love this
[1:16:10] so much victory till the lions couldn't
[1:16:12] eat it
[1:16:15] so much victory to the lions couldn't
[1:16:16] eat it
[1:16:18] he overcame it
[1:16:21] oh my oh he said chad wrapped me shaking
[1:16:23] a vinegar had so much victory he said
[1:16:25] you know victory's a hard thing to burn
[1:16:28] out or eat up or anything
[1:16:31] victory's a hard thing to clinch
[1:16:34] amen that's why we must have the victory
[1:16:36] in our life the victory in our soul the
[1:16:40] victory day the victory of calvary the
[1:16:43] victory of the resurrection and then
[1:16:45] through that victory comes victory after
[1:16:48] victory after oh sure there's opposition
[1:16:51] sure circumstances arise mountains
[1:16:54] bigger than us rivers wider than us
[1:16:57] everything else but in the midst of that
[1:16:59] that victory gives us strength because
[1:17:02] faith is the victory that overcometh the
[1:17:05] world it gives us strength to stand in
[1:17:08] the midst of that time and say i'm gonna
[1:17:11] keep on walking with god i'm gonna keep
[1:17:14] on being believer i'm going to stand on
[1:17:16] god's word because god hasn't changed
[1:17:19] his word hasn't changed laws have
[1:17:21] changed dictates have changed but god's
[1:17:24] never changed
[1:17:25] and i'm united with him who's unaltered
[1:17:32] hallelujah
[1:17:34] oh my
[1:17:35] think about that
[1:17:38] daniel
[1:17:39] as he came into that place
[1:17:43] in his life i like how brother brahman
[1:17:44] says it like this
[1:17:48] daniel said i got a testimony he's down
[1:17:50] there in paradise i got a testimony guys
[1:17:53] ezekiel is telling us daniel
[1:17:56] yeah i'm listening to ezekiel i got i
[1:17:58] got another one i got another one i got
[1:17:59] another one i got i want to talk about
[1:18:01] that one who i seen the stone
[1:18:03] you down the mountain without have but i
[1:18:05] got more i didn't just have one
[1:18:07] visitation
[1:18:08] he
[1:18:10] visited aren't you glad he keeps
[1:18:12] visiting you
[1:18:15] every visitation it strengthens your eye
[1:18:19] for these moments
[1:18:22] to walk
[1:18:23] in an unaltered
[1:18:25] way let's just stop there tonight
[1:18:29] if i get going on this next part we'll
[1:18:31] just
[1:18:33] we'll just we'll be here
[1:18:36] unaltered
[1:18:39] i want you to notice daniel's demeanor
[1:18:41] in this time
[1:18:43] he wasn't arrogant
[1:18:46] daniel was under
[1:18:48] a greater law
[1:18:51] it was the law
[1:18:53] of almighty god
[1:18:55] he had the right motive
[1:18:56] he had the right objective
[1:19:00] and so in the midst when all that was
[1:19:01] taking place
[1:19:03] daniel could walk in there and as that
[1:19:05] scripture we read i think it was verse
[1:19:07] 10 i believe where we ended
[1:19:09] that when that that came about that day
[1:19:13] daniel said
[1:19:15] i know this statue has been
[1:19:18] that god has still said
[1:19:20] to seek him
[1:19:23] daniel said you know what i'm gonna open
[1:19:25] the windows
[1:19:26] daniel are you doing no no i always do
[1:19:28] that right
[1:19:30] i've always opened the windows i've
[1:19:32] always opened the shades right
[1:19:34] so this is just another day
[1:19:36] in the life
[1:19:38] of one with victory
[1:19:40] it's unaltered
[1:19:42] let me tell you tonight if you don't
[1:19:44] have that victory in your heart down in
[1:19:45] that place you can come to that place in
[1:19:48] god if you just invite him in brother
[1:19:51] samuel i have faith you do he's given
[1:19:53] you faith but if you just invite him
[1:19:56] he'll operate on your faith
[1:19:58] and it will no longer be just
[1:20:01] a mental faith
[1:20:02] that it will become a supernatural faith
[1:20:05] of the living god
[1:20:07] where it will no longer be just your
[1:20:09] faith
[1:20:10] because look
[1:20:11] even after the new birth has come
[1:20:14] we still have to contend
[1:20:15] with our mental faith at times
[1:20:19] but that super sense that victor on the
[1:20:21] inside that which is unalterable that's
[1:20:23] why when times when we prayed about
[1:20:25] things and we didn't get an answer or
[1:20:27] things didn't come the way we thought
[1:20:28] about it
[1:20:29] it doesn't move this down here
[1:20:32] we might be disappointed we might say
[1:20:34] what what took place but you know the
[1:20:36] victory down on the inside
[1:20:38] is what you draw from and saying
[1:20:40] i don't understand
[1:20:42] i don't know why he said no
[1:20:44] but he's in control
[1:20:47] and it's an unaltered
[1:20:50] life
[1:20:51] by the holy ghost
[1:20:54] that's the kind of lies we want to live
[1:20:57] that's a testimony we want to have like
[1:20:58] daniel
[1:20:59] unaltered
[1:21:01] that no matter what comes what test when
[1:21:04] we're tested by the word because
[1:21:05] remember
[1:21:07] everybody experiences job loss
[1:21:09] people experience fires people get sick
[1:21:12] people cancer
[1:21:14] cancer coveted on and on we can go on on
[1:21:17] we're not exempt the world we face the
[1:21:19] same things the world faces is that
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:22] but the difference
[1:21:24] the difference
[1:21:26] is the lord jesus christ
[1:21:30] when god told egypt he said that you
[1:21:32] will know how i how the lord doth make a
[1:21:35] difference
[1:21:36] how did god make a difference by the
[1:21:38] blood
[1:21:39] being on the door
[1:21:41] that's how god
[1:21:42] makes a difference it's that token life
[1:21:45] oh
[1:21:46] you know you may not be able to hold you
[1:21:48] know by the same i really can't remember
[1:21:50] i remember a few quotes or i remember a
[1:21:51] few scriptures
[1:21:52] it ain't about remembering quotes and
[1:21:54] scriptures
[1:21:56] you could remember all the quotes and
[1:21:57] scriptures i'm not against that you know
[1:21:59] that i mean before i god ever revealed
[1:22:01] that he called me to preach i love to
[1:22:03] read the word of god i listen to the
[1:22:04] word listen listen and read
[1:22:07] but it ain't about how much you can
[1:22:08] quote
[1:22:10] so don't let the devil beat you down
[1:22:12] about that
[1:22:13] it's what happens in the face of
[1:22:15] everyday life
[1:22:17] when you're faced with tests and
[1:22:19] temptations
[1:22:20] and sometimes you don't even have you
[1:22:21] might say well man i need a word to
[1:22:23] speak towards this
[1:22:25] you are that word
[1:22:27] he is the word inside of you and your
[1:22:29] reaction to that at that point is the
[1:22:32] word speaking through your life
[1:22:35] oh my god
[1:22:44] heavenly father
[1:22:46] lord jesus how we just appreciate you
[1:22:49] lord
[1:22:51] father
[1:22:53] we lord
[1:22:55] are living
[1:22:57] in a dying world among a dying
[1:22:58] generation
[1:23:00] we see
[1:23:02] that lord even things all around us
[1:23:05] things changing
[1:23:07] lord
[1:23:08] even without that things change but we
[1:23:10] see such change lord things changing
[1:23:15] but dear god like daniel when he in the
[1:23:17] midst of of babylon he and the other
[1:23:21] believers that were there a very small
[1:23:23] group
[1:23:24] your prophet called it four overcomers
[1:23:26] that was there
[1:23:29] and they were tested by the word
[1:23:32] there were there were others that
[1:23:34] evidently
[1:23:36] that lord they would give in under the
[1:23:38] pressure the pressure would come to such
[1:23:40] a place it would be so great that they
[1:23:41] would give in
[1:23:43] lord
[1:23:45] we have to bring it back to the glory of
[1:23:47] god
[1:23:48] there is no flesh that can stand against
[1:23:51] the pressures
[1:23:53] of this age or any age whether it was
[1:23:55] down in babylon wherever no no flesh
[1:23:59] none
[1:24:00] could stand against the pressures
[1:24:03] the lord
[1:24:05] it takes one
[1:24:07] to stand
[1:24:09] and i'm thankful tonight lord
[1:24:11] i believe the congregation
[1:24:14] lord
[1:24:15] testifies with me
[1:24:17] we're thankful that
[1:24:18] there's one who's standing on our behalf
[1:24:22] in this time trouble
[1:24:24] there's one who's standing
[1:24:28] lord daniel wrote of him in daniel 12 of
[1:24:31] how that you will make yourself known
[1:24:34] to israel

[1:24:46] that
[1:24:48] power of the living god that conquering
