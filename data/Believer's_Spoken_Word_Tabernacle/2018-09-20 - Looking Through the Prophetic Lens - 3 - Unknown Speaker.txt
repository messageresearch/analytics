again I want to say just from sister Kim and myself we certainly appreciated the prayers we were there we had three services that were there Ian and one that was just primarily focused to the men and with brother Eugene and the congregation there in Edmonton and the Lord was just so so good to us and I just so appreciate how the Lord just brought such a continuity you know within the services and just spoke to our hearts and and made a good way back home for us I really appreciate that I covered your prayers tonight I'm not really feeling all that well myself just you know it's something you know how it is you travel you get a little bit of a if you deal with things having sinus and so forth I've got a little bit of that and when we stepped off the plane on Friday well we went here from what 80s so all of a sudden I stepped off the plane it was in the 30s you know I love snow and snow was on the ground it snowed the whole time except for the last day and so you know you have that part which I'm having my psyche my mind is having to adjust to that because I'm used to going as we all are from the winter into the spring and then into the summer you know the work that's normal but everything now from going through that I I find myself trying to look back at events at the first year I thinking wait a minute I'm back in warm no I have to remind myself we have not went through the winter yet here and you know it was the grayness you know how it is here when it's December and times where it's like the thick grayness and yet you don't see any sunlight and they said that was a little bit uncharacteristic for them but not need needless to say it was just a wonderful time with the brothers and sisters there and brother Eugene and sister Sarah Braun just just such a wonderful time of fellowship and well so just just so thankful for your prayers and that's that's what I was counting on is your prayers when we went in there to those services that the Lord would just have his way and say what he wanted to be said I heard you had a wonderful service here Amen just so thankful to the Lord for that amen so appreciate that I want to make just a few announcements before we turn in the word and that is I want to say I appreciate brother ray getting this together about the for the brothers to come together and eat on Sunday brother ray he's always thinking about eating but I'm just gonna if I could I just like to change it to we'll just meet we'll just go to the Perkins restaurant as well because I know that for some of for the brothers and things too to be able to help their wives in some cases and also to be there for their Adam also at times you know to be there maybe to get some pictures during that time as well so we can find another place in that restaurant to get off to ourselves if that be alright and and just have that in and it's instead I'd write I wanted to make that announcement instead of just send it out to you by email because you might be looking at saying what's being said and I hope that's clear tonight I hope I haven't fussed everything up you know so for the brothers we will also go to Perkins but we will not be in the shower and I okay with that all right brother ray you'll be on point to make sure you get the table set up there like to also say we thank God I'm not going to be able to read this but we want to thank God for answering prayer you know brother mark has been giving a request for the Lord to to provide a job for him and the Lord willing a testimony follow and God has certainly answered the prayer I would say you know the details and things like that that they can certainly they're important and they can be shared with others but the market had a print out there and just for a sake of time within a service I think the most important thing is when we see God move in different prayers that request that we have and no matter what that is in this situation it's for a job and we've seen God move for that here in the assembly I all my heart and we can say lord help me together all of these things in and to just to rest upon you for the needs that are in my life amen I believe that these are testimonies the things that happen in our life when you look what Paul said Paul said in the book of Philippians the things which have befallen us have done so for the furtherance of the gospel so the the experiences and tests and trials in our life are truly the molding and shaping and the growing of the character in our life and yet at the same time that is also a testimony and a comfort to others as well so we just want to say thank God for that we so appreciate the Lord so are you ready for the word tonight amen let's look in the word and in Psalms 32 and we just ask the Lord that he would just come by our way tonight because we surely need him we surely need him Psalms 32 and we're just going to read a few verses and we'll let you be seated but beginning at verse 7 and I want you to notice here's David this is David declaring this of the Lord thou art my hiding place and thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance Salem and I will know what God respond and watch what God says directly I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go and I will guide thee with mine I ve not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouths must be held in with bit and brow and bridle lest they come near unto thee many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord mercy shall compass him about be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart so let's just ask his blessing on the word as we look into it this evening Heavenly Father Oh God we are just so thankful for this opportunity that we have to be able to come together as believers brothers and sisters of like precious faith Father we pray this evening that oh god that you would come Lord in our myths Lord through your word and that you would Lord move us out of the way speak O God to our hearts Lord and father Lord calls Lord our hearts Lord to understand Lord O God we just ask that you would now minister Lord for you know every need Lord in our midst or God and father may you settle every heart Lord Jesus and I pray that God that you'll just Lord have your way in the service Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless yous your being seated I want to just if you would look with me as well in John 5 verse 19 I want to go back into that place of Scripture noticing the the comfort that David is expressed that the Lord is his hiding place and that the Lord Himself will preserve him in that of trouble and he would surround him with songs of deliverance and God's fulfillment or God's commitment is that I will instruct thee and teach the in the way which thou shalt go and I will guide thee with mine I I look at that and I know there's so much you know and God will break as we have need of it open to what we have need of but I look at the simplicity that God would speak to us be not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle unless they come near thee God's desire is that our lives would be so harnessed to his word by his spirit that we are not in a place to where we have to be driven but where we can be led that's God's pleasure you you realize that that's his pleasure the Bible says that this that the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God leadership is a privilege it's an honor to be to be led that is God's greatest desire look how God came down and even though Israel knew the promise of what God had for them when they were in Egypt they knew about the promise they even had a reminder that they would walk by daily weekly depending on where they were at that God was gonna visit them according to the promise they could look at the bones of Joseph he said when God visits you and he will don't you leave my bones here you take him back with you so they had a constant reminder among them but within this it took God coming on the scene and we we know the background on the story we don't have time for that but God come on the scene and even though Moses would be the human vessel in which God would take and speak his word through yet Moses himself had to be completely surrendered and completely stripped of himself in order for God to do it and then God moves through that channel in God then brings the people out in the land and it's God leading them the entire time it's God's leadership it was a privilege they were not brought out as the Spirit of God would remind him in the book of Deuteronomy you were not brought out of the iron furnace of Egypt by your own doing but I brought you out as a matter of fact God let him know I have bore you unto myself on eagle's wings God was letting them know all of these things were reminders of what he had done and if we can see it and look at it then we can rest to know that what he has done he which was is the same he that is and he that is is the same he that shall come so it's Jesus Christ from beginning to end it's all that privilege of being under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and to see how that God here when this expression that is given in John 5:19 a very a very common scripture to us that we can look at an old that this this is not just a scripture to us as believers but we recognize this is the privilege that is afforded to sons and daughters of God who through the very opening of the blood cell of the Lamb of God and the imparting of that life that we have the opportunity and privilege to come into this relationship that God was in Christ and we have the privilege to come into that relationship that is God in Christ and Christ in US making us one and accepted in the beloved it is a privilege it is it is the honor that we have for this invitation because remember what Adam forfeited Christ came and redeemed when God could speak to Adam in the beginning these were not when Adam named those creatures Adam was not guessing it was not as though just words were just dropping but Adam was walking under the very mind of God in that moment to be able to speak in other words Adam was not saying giraffe and then looking to say did I say the right thing or horse did I say the right thing but you see there was such a harmony that came that Adam was operating in the mind of God and there was an authority that came with it Adam was was walking in a place to where he knew what God wanted in the season of the word that he was in Adam did not know what God or what the full understanding was on multiply and replenish we understand that right we understand he didn't know that at that time but you see what God has spoken the promise is if we will walk faithful and obedience and patiently wait by looking to him God will bring everything to pass in his season and in his time and we'll be right in line with what he is doing in that moment Satan knows that God's promise cannot fail because the promise is God you ask me he knows it cannot fail so remember the same tactic that Satan is always used is to try to push people beyond the promise or to hold them back from the promise see there's ways of doing that the same thing applies which the Prophet made these statements and they are principles that have not passed but principles that must be applied to today and that is man is always rejoicing in what has been looking to what will be but failing to catch the junction that joins the past and the future and the only one who joins that is Christ himself you see when Christ himself is revealed there's no longer a breach between the past and the future now you see him who was is and shall be you see Christ being revealed because we can look at the past rejoice in the past relish with the past and miss the present and to miss the present is to miss the future so then to correctly then to be able to see this is to recognize him then it's him back there and to recognize that he's still the same God today and what is his plan and his program and his desire for this moment and this is what the Lord Jesus is expressing here that the son can do nothing what obedience this was not one who had bitten bridle in his mouth but here was an understanding it is very important the son can do nothing is up he knew who he was he knew his position he knew his relationship see all of this it did not result result in a place of pride you see when one understands who they are and in the relationship it brings forth a real true humility to wait and to look to the Lord for all things because it's not about what man looks at what man is seeing what man wants but it's about what does my father what it's looking to please him that's the objective so this is what the Lord Jesus is making aware that what the son see it so here the opening of this of the veil here this relationship what the son seeth the father doing now I want you to catch this here here is is the Lord Jesus standing in this time here and these promises that have laid in the scripture concerning the Messiah have been quickened to him they have been made alive to him personally and so what he is expressing is who the Word says he is so he's walking in this place of authority there's a channel that is open between him and the Father in other words the readings the scrolls the prophets the Psalms all of those things are no longer just print but those things unfold to him his position of who he is and there's a channel that's open that he's able to see what God is doing in that time so it's not just listen to me it's not just walking around the scrolls and say thank God for Jeremiah thank God for Isaiah thank God for Ezekiel thank God for Joel thank God for Habakkuk know he is catching the vision of who it is that was behind the prophets and by catching that vision then he himself is standing there to fulfill the words that were spoken by the prophets moved by the Spirit of God and as he submits to that in humility the same Spirit of God who moved upon the prophets to speak that word is the same spirit of God moving through him to manifest that word so it's the same working of God all the way God with us God above us God with us God in us so here it's the Sun who holds that life remember the father of the word and that as it speaks the father the word the son the Holy Spirit these are one it's a pulsating of life think of this he who the Sun quickeneth has life this is the promise as that right and to see how that when that word was moving it brought those who were just walking in an order of life an order of cosmos of this life when that word moved upon them it quickens them and raises them from the order of cosmos to the order of true life you know we read in the scriptures so and where Andrew and Philip and all them they left and they left they were no longer tax collector they were no longer this they were no longer that that whole the whole synopsis of all of that is that what where they were at already remember they knew these prophecies they knew these writings are you with me they weren't ignorant of these things they knew about them they knew about them just as well as the Pharisees knew about them but the difference is is that when this promise of the Messiah was manifested on to them through the Lord Jesus it was something that it brought forth in them as they were identified in that promise and everything else of this life became secondary they understand when we look at this in the prints of the word it's not saying will you quit your job you do this you quit this you quit that and we go and we live in a communal environment that's not what that's not the program at all but what it is expressing that when this has truly been revealed and what is taking place everything else becomes secondary and it becomes this Paul express Christ who is our life if you think back in the days of Noah Noah once that is revealed Noah did nothing that would hinder the ark from going forward so what was it Christ in that day was the theme of Noah's message he was the theme of Noah's life he was the thinking filter of which Noah passed everything through and judged all things by that revelation that had taken preeminence in his life you see we speak of discernment but it's discerning all things because all around us and in every moment no maybe you can never let down discernment is not an option discernment is not like heated and cooled seats in your car discernment is a must for the hour hallelujah and then discernment itself when we look that the site that was present at that time were those who were polishing the tombs of those who had been moved by the Spirit of God but they kept going around those tombs and they were worshipping as it were the latter but yet they failed to see the Christ the God who was present there to even express what became letter they failed to catch that and see it and because of that they looked at the latter they looked at the Lord Jesus and they said this is what Moses said your Beelzebub they could not tie the two together but here are ignorant and unlearned men and it was not their learning that brought the two together but it was that election and foreign nation of God was there and the presence of God moving upon their life it ties those things together where that the promises were laying here that they were looking for and there was a seed and within their hearts and their life Christ himself spans the breach and gets a hold of their life and manifesting that promise so that the life itself will flow into the body of believers its Christ working it's his life so well the rest is looking at just letter and all they see his church that's all they see is Church all they see his letter all they see is tradition and remember now they weren't lazy they were zealous regarding church they were zealous regarding traditions even with things with brother so-and-so the brother so-and-so the brother so-and-so said that brother so-and-so said all of those things they were zealous with traditions they were zealous with the latter but the Lord Jesus could see the father working you with me he was working he was moving and he caught what was taking place to where now that even when the Lord Jesus was letting them know John has come he's introduced the Messiah so there was a junction introduced the Messiah now here he is coming to a place to where now the offering up and the fulfillment of that word will lead into another part another phase where it will actually be that same God now come and dwell inside of the people tabernacling in the mystical body of Jesus Christ through him by this spirit so it's a key Junction to know where we're at and even the Lord Jesus himself would speak of this in John 14 and he referred and said the Spirit of Truth and that's powerful the spirit of truth remember truth is not a doctrine truth is not a letter truth is the person of Jesus Christ the Spirit of Truth so notice the Lord Jesus says whom the world cannot receive they can't receive the Spirit of Truth because if cieth him not it's not aware of him because it sees him not neither knows him and that incredible looking at the same word but yet cannot see him I tell you if your eyes and your heart are opened you ought to be thankful to God because let me tell you something you didn't give that to yourself God has given that to you [Applause] you didn't study your way into it you are ordained to it and remember it's not these eyes it's this down here these are the eyes that he's come to open right this was closed off the profits at times the profits could see the profits could they would Express of what was going on but you realize all of those things were examples of what God's desire was to do and to be once he got himself a son again he had to get himself a son again in order that he might come down pay the price and then impart his life upon that life that was already there in order to breed back sons and daughters of God again he had to do that a great mystery of his life being expressed and notice he says because they see him not neither know him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you the Lord Jesus has just declared in the scripture that he that is walking with you though he is here in this veil in this vessel he shall be in you see see it was necessary to catch that Junction from he that is with you too he that is in you it's necessary without catching that you're still looking back he then is with us the Lord Jesus walking with us though but remember the Lord Jesus here his word of what he has said the Spirit of Truth he will come to you is the right according to his word amen so we see that that the Spirit of Truth it is that person of the Lord Jesus Christ and I take our direction and our focus here back to the scripture we were looking at there a few weeks ago out of Zechariah 4 and to look at it in this manner of Zechariah 4 verse 1 whereby that the angel Zechariah said that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and as we were just just speaking on this in the closing moments the last time I believe if we notice within the scripture here when we look at it then it waked me as a man then is wakened out of his sleep but notice what it was that woke him up the angel talked with me so the angel was not just present but there was a message there was something to be given that pertained to him and when this was apparently angel that spoke to me came again a woke me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and to realize here Zecharia has the Spirit of God is making this clear to us Zakaria is here in the midst of this time and remember this is a time right here in the rebuilding of the temple after the return of Babylon there within the stages to where wort has been has ceased for 15 years and and notice the Holy Spirit speaking here within it Zechariah is wakened his lies are wide open but now he becomes awakened you know your eyes can be open and yet you're asleep I mean there are people who can do that but I'm saying you can have your eyes open and yet you're not alert to what's taking place because it's not these eyes that see it it's the eyes down here it's because of the new birth the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Truth the guide that has come into the Church of the Living God that lets us see that the father is not dormant the father is working he is working what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise it's operating in an open channel of what God is doing within this hour so notice how the Spirit of God will take Zechariah in that time and he will show Zachariah the seven golden candlesticks then he brings Zachariah to a place which is a statement that I I believe is so so important that I trust that we can pick up here and a little bit we're God lets him know this when you're looking at those seven golden candlesticks you're seeing those two olive trees one on either side where the oil is feeding there into that lamp stand let this be known to you Zechariah that this is not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord God is letting it be known this is my working this is instrumentation but I am the energy I am the vine ye are the branches hallelujah notice how the Spirit of God would take us as Paul would direct us in Romans 13:11 and it would say and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed I want you to catch this Paul is writing this Paul is the first church age messenger and Paul here he is writing and the age itself is even opening afterwards and Paul is writing this by under the leadership and the unction of the Holy Spirit because remember God is building a church and it's not something that it waits to the end and then all of a sudden at the end he gets built but it's little by little stone on top of stone experience after experience word on top of word trial after trial it is all being built as a habitation for Almighty God and this is where Paul is calling the urgency it's high time to awake out of sleep so it's not that the people were sleeping physically this is not he's speaking spiritually they're not aware of what's going on now you can look and I can look and we recognize that this was not the hour of of the coming of the Lord and yet it was his coming this is all part of his coming the coming of the Holy Spirit in every age he's coming and he's gonna come in a corporal body for those he's come for here with me so here Paul is wakening them to the place for it for right now is our salvation nearer than when we believe you catch that the word itself coming in this moment it puts the believers in awareness to live for that moment and they are living for that time because we don't know the day nor the hour but we are living for that moment it's like you're waiting maybe you know as the testimony we have for a job you're praying for a job Lord I'm looking for you for a job Lord this is what you said in the word that I've never seen the righteous forsaken or a child of God bringing bread all of those promises are coming out in prayer and you're reciting those promises and you know what as you're praying over those promises those are your promises and as you're praying you're waiting you're watching you're believing and then when the door itself opens you're alerted this is the time this is the moment you're alerted to that which you've been alerted to wait for for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed you consider this Paul being an Alpha messenger you consider that the ministry that God has brought upon this earth in the last day was to do what I have preached what Paul has preached many of the things which Paul spoke it put the believers down through the age into that place of readiness how did it happen by the word by the word you see this was not something to say let's all go sell our houses let's all go create a little campsite and we'll all just pitch tents around this over this way no that's to make yourself odd that's to make yourself odd but the direct instructions and guidance of the Holy Spirit coming through the Prophet he said don't make yourself odd when people can look at things like that and say it's a call they've got a right to say that because there can be cultic actions how you estimate cultic behaviors but the bride of Jesus cries is not operated by Coptic behavior she is under the leadership of the Holy Spirit it is cries in our midst that we are worshiping with but we are rallying around him because without him we have no life hallelujah notice the unction the night is far spent the day is at hand Paul declared it there the day is at hand very close it is at hand at hand doesn't mean right now but it means to be alert for that which is approaching stand on guard to be ready when even when through and when when John could say the kingdom of heaven is at hand at hand here it is here it is a present approach let us look at this let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light the Lord is the light of my life let us not want to let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light moving and being clothed and dressed in the light of him let us walk notice let us walk honestly as in the day now if you turn off the lights and it's dark people could do things and nobody would see it but Paul is letting them know let us walk honestly there would be dark but light has come to us the day has already broke in our hearts let us walk honestly as in the day hallelujah not in rioting and in drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and inhibiting you not pause preaching here he's preaching the message and the Ministry of all of the character of that heavenly Jerusalem because after all the order of the city is the order of the people who live in it and this is why that the Prophet would express this when he's there in God hiding in self in simplicity and revealing himself in the same he's dedicating that of the elder of the tabernacle they're a jury at Jeffersonville but that is not the focus that is not the event that was taking wrong taking place but there was a tabernacle of the Living God the bride of Jesus Christ that by the word is being dedicated to God himself that he might step in that Tabernacle the word calling us to himself you with me he that was there in that ministry was to declare and announce that as the passing of that veil moves off it was to bring us to a place to where it is no longer a swelling with Christ but Christ dwelling in Christ in you the hope of glory and how are we dedicated by the word the way it brings us to a place of dedication and you are that Tabernacle that he purchased you are that building that he's been working on he's been building down through the ages that he himself might step in his fullness into his bride body ooh let us walk honestly as in the day let us as the Prophet said characterize our selves here as though we were already there let us live here as though we would live there if what is the quick examination if what you are doing here and the way you are standing here and you cannot fit it in over there then you need to repent and you need to allow God to move for you so that your life can reflect that over there because the rapture is not going to change that the rapture is a manifestation of a change and a molding that's already been going on the rapture is the final climax of the rapture here with me the rapture is a cycle whereby you have already caught up with Jesus Christ though here we who were dead in sin and trespasses yet now hath he quickened and we are seating seated in heavenly places with Christ Jesus we recognize we have representation we recognize and know who we are see that authority in that channel opens we are citizens of the king our citizenship is in heaven I don't care what your earthly is your that soul is a citizen of heaven you are you you are a delegate of heaven you now they send delegates from one nation to another nation and they represent this nation what this nation stands for let me tell you something when God deposited his life and raised up that life that was already predestinated within you you are a delegate of heaven you are a representative of all that heaven is and all that heaven stands for and as you stand upon that word then all of heaven is standing behind you you are delicate of that new City a delicate of that heavenly Jerusalem because the lie of that round that heavenly Jerusalem has moved inside of you we are not of Hagar we are not of a church we are not of a movement we are born of that New Jerusalem the Holy Spirit and showing forth at our site has become open we have met our milk esident and he is here with us to repeat of God and we are looking for a city whose builder and maker is God glory be to God hallelujah blessed should be the name of the Lord hallelujah you talking about riches we've got true riches do you catch that when Abraham here after the battle was over that he was tempted with the riches of Sodom he was tempted for all the labor that he had done in bringing back those souls he was tempted to take and be made rich by Sodom but he stood there has a true son of God and he refused the rich of Sodom and when he refused the riches of Sodom here came Melchizedek and the Prophet tells us Melchizedek had been put out of Jerusalem there and he was coming to Abraham as Christ was put out of the church but he come to you he came to me at sons and daughters of God where he's not exiled he's not a fugitive he is the love and desire of our lives here's my riches here's my pleasure this bread this wine but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ notice puts you on sink into sink into the Lord Jesus Christ sink into yielded being clothed with him and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof make not providential care for the flesh how do I not make providential care provision for the flesh by being focused on him as you're focused on him he is your authority for every attack that comes upon you he is our strength thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me in the time of trouble that will compass me with songs of deliverance you know what a song does I could play a melody up here right now and you'd start singing it words would come right back to you when a melody strikes there's a power within something sometimes you know you might be in a store and they're songs you used to listen to before God got ahold of your life and that little tune can go over you could finish every phrase in every stanza and everything else why those words are so packed down in there and that song begins to stimulated well let me tell you something there is a song of deliverance that is a song of the redeemed a song of the Redeemer in Revelations 5 when it was broken it said they sang a new song our life is comfortable with the music of God symphony of which we are a part of this great symphony we are encompassed about we're songs of deliverance you let it be when you're going through a test you're going through a trial and all of a sudden a portal strike and something rises up within you I am the Lord that deliver thee I am the lord that he'll see I am redeemed I am a son of God I am a daughter of God he is my way maker it's songs of deliverance Paul is it truly exhorting the believers that they would walk in faith that they may please the Lord and prevail and stifle anything that would seek to hinder attacks are always around us always but remember let us walk honestly as in the day let us walk honestly let us be focused on him let us put him on I know how do I put him on what as he is opening himself up in the word walking that the things that that God is breaking in ministering listen friends you know this just as much as I know it the things that is being ministered right here are not things that is contrived by my thinking you know as well as I do there are things that where chords are being struck of scriptures you've read there's messages you've been listening to and certain things that are coming together I'm telling you this is not the orchestration of man it's God his program and what he's doing to show you his providential care for us and if he cares for us we ought to care about what he's doing and give ourselves to it what we see the father doing that doeth the son likewise o blessed be his name the Bible says in Hebrews 11 let me come down in Hebrews 11 the Bible says that Abraham and Sarah they said they looked for a city whose builder and maker was God they knew that city would have to be upon this earth see that mystery already hidden back there that was just not a good saying to tickle people's ears it was a reality showing that the future home would be here upon this earth to know even as God would speak to Abraham and let Abraham know that that would whatsoever not that I see it from the north to south east to west over into a land that I have given thee you know God was saying this land is yours even though you've not walked on it I've already given it to you the land already belong to him let me tell you something every promise already belongs to you hallelujah is to stand up there and declare what belongs to you this promise bones to me he made a way for me and this promise is for me if there hadn't been nobody else he made that promise with me and mind glory be to God they were looking for a city whose builder and maker was God the Bible said they embrace the promises they embraced you know that word embrace it means they took them to their bosom they cherish those promises those promises it affected their life these were not these were not people who were just moving around things but these were people who the spirit of the promise that it spoke of the coming Messiah had so plucked their heartstrings that they took those promises and they were waiting they held him dear to their hearts oh sure they had ups and downs sure sure they had times of discouragement tell them somebody you know what in reality not only was God molding and making them but if the Prophet would point out to us and souls in prison now he said I often wondered how why God would let Abraham and Sarah go down there like that he said but then I come to realize if it hadn't have been for that we would not have known the grace of God hallelujah glory it's one thing to know God's grace when God picks you up by the bootstraps and he saves your soul and filled you with the Holy Ghost but oh man how grace begins to teach our heart to fear even in the times when we have failed him when we have done maybe from our best or or in the mistakes that we made of failures but yet grace itself oh how great it appears to our life not that we might get by but thank God for His grace that we might go forward they embrace those promises they moved forward by the Spirit of God waiting for him these were not people who embraced the promises that just casually went and offered a lamb no they embrace the promise they embraced it it wasn't just going to the Tabernacle to offer a lamb it wasn't just offering up turtledoves you say brother Samuel did they see everything they didn't but what God had spoken that time it was something about it that they could see that this being God's program God's Way God's will and they were directed in it so they weren't people going through motions they were people who were put in motion the scripture says in second Corinthians 5:7 familiar scripture to us for we walk by faith and not by sight that's just a declarative and we did you just needed to declare that tonight I walk by faith and not by sight but I know there's been time forget the past behind you we walk by faith and not by sight oh brother Samuel that's awful deep of grief hey I'm not the one to preach the message of grace God preached a message of grace the prophets tapped into that inspiration when Abraham did what he did come on now when he took Hagar was he walking by faith or by sight by sight but watch this God's commitment to the promise that God Himself comes on the scene and showing his promise will not and it cannot be defeated and proving that in Abraham is out that elect stock when the way would pass over his way notice what happens quickly he's able to keep moving in by faith and not allowing the past to dominate and dictate his life that's faith faith allows you to say the past is the past to forget those things which are behind me can i press forward to the mark that leads ahead of me it shows where your eye is God is not having eyes on the side of his head looking back that's an unclean spirit but God's eye is an eye that looks forward it looks forward not behind because that which is behind is behind then alive I feel good already glory we walk by faith and not by sight you know citing just your nuts rise it's feelings too it's our thoughts sometimes that's walking here in this realm but we walk not by faith now I'm gonna just just drop this little example here and we'll just move move on let me just would you bring it down here here's a man by the name of blind Bartimaeus that each and every one of us we've heard about right hallelujah and you know brother Branham over here we'll go through this brother Graham did not tell this as rehearsing a Bible story you know what I'm talking about don't you when brother bran referred to these things and he would preach blind Bartimaeus he would preach those that many times over and then he would refer to these things do you realize brother Branham wasn't preaching a story he was preaching an event that was prophecy of what was to be that evening he was preaching what was to be prophecy for you and me that's what the script this is a book of prophecy not a book of history if it remains a book of history oh we worship around oh jesus healed the sick jesus healed the sick what a mighty ministry Jesus had Jesus did all sorts of things here we are were worshipping around the outside of what was done and were polishing up what he did this is not a book of history it's a book of prophecy what has taken place listen to me these are these prophecies are promises and in this hour God ain't makin promises he's fulfilling them he's fulfilling what he has promised some promises in prophecy are not written they're expressed can I preach a few moments they're not written but they're expressed Rebecca's low-road but yet it was the expression of the prophecy in her life same with Esther same acerra same with Mary but think about those contents of expression that are wrote in the word that if God not coming to show you and I you and I would have a king down there in career lusting after an old grandma and he lusted after her he wanted her so bad come on somebody but you see God opened it up to show you and I they were not old people they had been changed they were changed to receive the coming son it didn't see this and having that written there but there's an expression of prophecy that is picked up blind Bartimaeus he's sitting by the highway with Ram you know here brother Ram drama town daring a cool October morning leaves blowing by here's blind Bartimaeus now he not ignorant of the word he heard about a God who was above them he heard that but a blind bartimaeus when the Bible says when he heard that what was taking place that he was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out he recognized and he was convinced God was in Christ no sir you weren't gonna keep him just keep on going around Jericho old Joshua Joshua fought the Battle of Jericho Jericho sir buddy he recognized that the same God who led Joshua and brought those walls down was that same God who was present in Christ what was it faith gave him sight to where he which was he recognized he is and that tied him into the future without recognizing this he would remain blind you with me many charge to me this is what they said Shh shut up quit saying that so loud you're you're disturbing everything what the Bible says he crowd all crying all the more louder Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me he had a claim on him a son of David and here God revealed his power that was there in Christ to bartimaeus in that hour let me tell you what his crying did the Bible said Jesus stood still Jesus stopped it got a hold of his attention now you and I both know there ain't no way that his voice was greater than the rest of the voice it was faith that made contact with the Lord Jesus it was two on impotents coming together come on somebody just like the Prophet said in spiritual food a new season he said this is the secret here he said to recognize he said that how that it must be that gift in my life and there must be a gift of faith in your life and he said then that gift of faith in your life is able to receive what the gift has given forth in me and that is our secret food do you recognize that is our secret food it is Christ the eye of God dwelling in his many membered body just as he was dwelling and speaking and ministry through various prophet but now what is it dwelling within his bright body and it's that secret food sustaining quickening moving us it's not we're coming to hear sermons well wonder what's gonna be said today no this is life this is secret food right you're not eating raw stalks of celery you're not eating cabbages it's been stored up but you're not eating raw cabbage we're not eating raw carrots but there's a man on the scene come on now that man who can turn on the light and he's the one that's bringing it all together he had prepared for me a table in the presence of mine enemies come on somebody he ain't giving us no this ain't a tray with a pocket of radishes a pocket of cucumbers and a pocket of this no sir he had prepared his meal for us let me tell you something when he gave us the promised messiah he didn't give us grain he gave us bread from heaven that true manna glory be to God it's his life it's him that we're feeding on he son of man not a son a man that's to keep going oh oh thank God for this but it's to recognize him who sent it and he was dwelling in the midst because for him dwelling in the midst that he comes in the midst of you that junction that ties it together notice what he did boy he had a garment on and he casts that garment away that garment spoke of his condition that garment spoke he was a beggar where he said at spoke he was a beggar everything about him it spoke he was a beggar but when he was told to come and rise be of good comfort rise he calleth vm ma oh god help me drive this old man he was calling on Jesus he recognized him and the word spoke back and called him be of comfort and arise he was awake what I needed to arise and when he arose he can't stuff that garment he weren't gonna need that garment no more he wasn't gonna need that place that was not gonna be his become his pew his Bible was sitting there it had always been there and that's not no no no he didn't need that place no more he had fine the place what his heart had been long for and he cast aside that garment ain't gonna need that garment no more just like one of these days he will call in I shall answer and you and you and I ain't gonna need this garment no more [Music] hallelujah Lord that I may receive my sight what do you want that I might receive my sight and Jesus said go thy way and what's this he didn't spit up on the ground and put it upon his eyes he said well that's because he already had eyes that's true but notice what he's letting us know that in all things it is faith that brings it to past go thy way thy faith how does faith come by hearing the word of God go thy way thy faith hath made me help do you recognize he did not say because I touched you because I laid hands on you no no he didn't say that thy faith hath made thee whole what was it he just recognized God was present in Christ and at that moment he cried out and said this is my hour this is my moment this is my time and he acted upon it and threw everything else to the side it was high time it was high time that blind bartimaeus arose out of that and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way in their wonderful he received site you know listen he offered his lamb he offered his Turtledove but remember what that lamb was you know that's a dramatization the Prophet would give us remember what that lamb was that lamb was his eyes to get back home he needed eyes to get back home to see how do I get back home and you and I needed eyes to get back home our eyes were covered over with blindness filled with spiritual crusty matter you with me but God had provided a lamb and in that lamb is the life and that life coming up on the worshiper brings us from death unto life it brings us from worshipping around to worshiping in and that wonderful we're not worshipping around the revealed word we're worshipping in the revealed word hallelujah oh my how we thank God and we we are so grateful for all that God has done but we're not looking at it as history we recognize that what God did in the profit is what God does and is doing and will do in the believer now I'm not looking for another gift new I'm not looking for another gift all brother Samuel this man got I'm not looking for another gift there's a lot of gifts that can pop up there's a lot of things that can come along and get people God has sent a gift to a generation God has gifts in the body but not one gift is made to rally around the gift that God has given his church that were to rally around is Christ is that right you go to rallying around the gift God will show that that gift is indeed a gift from him and it's in side of humanity so we recognize we don't rally around the gift that God would place in a man we rally around Christ he's the one that we rally around you love him whatsoever the son see it the father doing that doeth the son likewise what a channel I'll tell you friends listen to me in this hour for our eyes to be open we're not making ourselves anything can you imagine look what they said concerning the Lord Jesus who do you think you are he made himself equal with God they who do you think you are they got upset with him because of him expressing unity with the father but remember it wasn't the people it was the spirit that was motivating them the same spirit that was upon Cain that motivated him the same spirit think of even how that Paul would even bring that forward in the book of Philippians then for us for you and I to be able to think it not robbery for to be able to say that I'm a believer I'm the son of God I'm a daughter of God I am one with Christ that's not robbery you're not taking away from him no it's releasing what he himself is now to be in you and through you you see it's recognizing the purpose the purpose of what it's all about to fail to recognize the person of Jesus Christ working in his many membered body now is to miss it but to recognize that it's Christ in you in me the hope of glory that's the purpose of the message coming and that is the working of the message now you with me remember it this the amount of a angel did not speak out and say as John the Baptist for run the Second Coming so shall you know it didn't say that it said so shall your message the message taking effect and flesh Christ in you and me is the declaration of the bride coming of Christ declares his coming to tie together he which was he that is he that is to come aren't you glad now remember he that is he'll still do James just like he did before and what he did before he'll do it again hallelujah for that which we see now has already been and that which has already been is now you love you let's pray Lord Jesus our hearts tremble father when we look upon these things Lord it's not Oh God with a slackness Oh Lord but father was seeing the awesomeness of the responsibility in this hour and Lord as we look at it in the word it's not about us making something happen it's us getting out of the
