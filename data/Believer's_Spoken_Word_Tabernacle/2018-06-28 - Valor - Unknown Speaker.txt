resting in a finished work that can even that can bring ourselves from this point to this point but he alone is the one that brings us from this point to this point you know even in all of our efforts of what we could do we're still standing right there but he came that he might open up the way that he might bring us back to that relationship with God that we had at one time a man and then through all of that our everything it's him bringing all things working in after the counsel of his own will that's a reality isn't it I'll tell you what more and more is every day goes by and just it doesn't it's not great big things I think God for that but that's not that it's the little things that you witness how God is moving and orchestrating and putting things just in place and sometimes it's something you might have come across months ago and then the Holy Spirit will inspire it to you just when you have need of it that's so precious how God knows just exactly what we have need of and when we have need of it in it it's just every little detail within our lives I'm so grateful as he reminds us through these things I've got it all in control and I think God for that Amen aren't you glad to be reminded of that Amen I sure AM I really am I want to want to welcome here sister blend is daughter Rebecca and your husband god bless you sure is good to have you all here amen good to

that you would guide us Lord in this service tonight Lord as we approach this time Lord and stand behind the sacred desk we approach it with all the reverence that we know Lord asking father for you to move to you to bring encouragement to the people Lord strength to the people who are to increase their faith we pray we asked for you to receive all glory from this service in Jesus Christ's name Amen while you're standing if you could turn in your Bibles to judges chapter 6 judges chapter 6 verse 11 and 12 there came an angel the Lord and set under the oak which was at Ofra that pertained to joash the a Birzeit and his son getting in thresh tweet by the winepress to hide it from the midi knights an angel the Lord appeared in him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor a man you may be seated I want to preach on valor tonight for just a little bit when Gideon was there and the Lord spoke to him of course Gideon didn't feel like no mighty man of our he was hiding and he was fearful of the Midianites that they would come because every time that Israel would reap in their crops or whatever then the middie Knights would come and descend upon him and take everything and so he was trying to do this in secrecy he wasn't doing it out in the open and so when the aims of Lord spoke to him and said mighty man of Valor he didn't feel like no mighty man of Valor if he was to look at himself in his mental mirror he would he would have he said to the angel the Lord he didn't feel like no mighty man of Valor he said he told the angel Lord he said if if you be with us why is all this befallen us many times that's a frame of mind that we'll get into when we're going through things and seems like things aren't going our way and things are looking kind of grim sometimes we get into the mind of why is this happening to me well who better for it to happen to would you draw their be happening in somebody else I've I've experienced and been through things which I told my my wife I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy you know but Gideon then begin to speak to the angel and said you know why is all this and fallenness didn't God deliver our people out of the Egypt back years ago and why where is all the miracles and many times we look around and wonder where the miracles are but they're here they're here I I never thought that I'd ever have Michael it sure didn't look like it the way things were going but God performed a miracle in his daddy's life and set him free and then you know then along comes Michael and he's been a blessing in my life as well as my other grandchildren Michael I've had a first hand in helping raising but the Lord the Lord said to him surely I'll be with thee that's all we need to know it did the Lord be with us that's all that we all the assurance we need is that he's with us we shouldn't have to worry if we know he's with us we shouldn't have to - question how is he going to happen or house this one - how am I going to be delivered here he said I'm gonna deliver the people by your hand many times we feel like we're in situations where we think well there's no way I could deliver myself but God through you can bring about the deliverance Gideon had to have faith that God said he was going to be with him because all of the things that was going on that's what get he was saying it doesn't look like you're with us so he had to believe when the Lord told him I'll I'm with you then he had to just accept that believe that well we know that then the Lord began to deal with Gideon on how he was going to bring about this deliverance and you know there was thirty two thousand Israelites it seems like a lot doesn't it thirty-two thousand Israelites that went down to to go up against the Midianites and to fight against them and when they got down there thirty two thousand and in they were outnumbered and the Lord said you've got too many with you because God wasn't going to deliver them by numbers but God was going to be the deliverance God working through his people was going to be the deliverance and God knew that there was some of them their heart wasn't in it they had gathered there with the others but their heart wasn't in it they were fearful they were thinking maybe we better just leave things the way it is Gideon I mean you could just make it worse maybe we should just accept it like it is and and let it go at that they were fearful and so the Lord told him he said say to whoever is fearful and afraid let them return to their home and 20 mm 69 almost 70% of the people returned back to their tents so here they were left with about 30 31 percent of the people left and Lord said you still got too many you still have too many then he told him said go down and said those that get down and lap like a dog set them aside those that get on their knee and lap from their hands set them aside and so then he set him aside and numbered him and there was 300 of them that knelt on a neat one knee and laughed out of their hand and God said this 300 that's the ones I'm gonna deliver you buy that's 1% of what they started out with 1% of what they started out with numbers doesn't mean that God's with you there's people that have picked their church they're gonna go to buy how big the church is how many people go there they wouldn't want to go to a small group they wouldn't want to go where there was empty pews they won't go to a big church I've talked to individuals who have left a message and one of the things that I hear them say well the church 1 2 now it's a big church so what what does that mean are you any more dedicated than you was when you were here no gain in numbers he deals with man in different numbers he deals sometimes he deals with them in large great numbers but sometimes he deals with him in small numbers and it's not the number that means anything it's the attitude in the number that you have you realize how much your attitude would affect a service and I'm not saying you actually have to have a bad attitude about church in order to affect the service you can have to be having a bad attitude about something else and you come in here you say well because you have this bad attitude about something else that's going on while I don't really feel like getting into the service I don't feel like amen I've seen people sit in church and pout there's ain't no place to coming about we don't want powders and dollars we want believers event we want worshipers churches get reputations I've told my church sis they get reputations by how easy or how hard it is to preach when you go there and evangelists I've been on the field myself and evangelists will kind of pass on word one to another oh you'll enjoy that church boy you'll have a good time there it's easy to preach or I'll tell you what I had to plow all the whole service at that one church or maybe they won't even say it they'll just say you're going there well god bless you brother I'll be praying for you I tell you what I love to preach where it's easy to prove whether people want to hear the word were the people the Bible says that if we hunger and thirst after righteousness we shall be filled and if we come in here hunger and in thirsty then God is going to come and fill us he's gonna meet those needs if we take those needs and lay them out I think a lot of people don't even get prepared for church they think getting revered search is figuring out what they're gonna wear it's not about what you're wearing it's not about how good you dressed or how poor you dress prepared to come to service if you got a need be praying and keeping that mindful and keeping that before the Lord that God will move he is a God of miracles keeping the good right attitude very attitude is a very important thing your attitude toward God affects your family your attitude about church affects your family I remember when I was just a young boy and we were going to church and my mom's family was coming in to visit us and they were gonna arrive while we were at church well my mom just left a key out for him and told him we'll see you when we get home from church that was a testimony that I grew up under not all mine my family's coming in well I guess on this church are you trying to get them to church or not get them to church you need to show them how important it is in your life what does church mean to you what is coming here mean to you is it dissing social gathering or are you coming here because it means your life divided down to 300 men 1% Benny begin to the Lord began to instruct getting on what he was going to do told him now you divide these these 300 men divide him into three groups and said I want the beach to take a trumpet and each to take a picture and he began to give him the instructions and get in then came and gave the instructions to the 300 men that were with him and said now we're each gonna have a trumpet and we're each gonna have a picture and so what we're going to do is we're going to Bowl on these trumpets when I give the signal not before not on your own time not whenever you feel like it but at the appropriate appointed time you're going to blow on your drum and you're going to break this picture okay that's all fine Gideon but how no word are we going to conquer these people there's less of us than they are then how are we going to be able to physically overcome them he said no listen to what I'm telling you we're going to we're going to blow on these trumpets and we're going to break these pictures and then we're going to we're going to shout with the loud voice and say the sort of the Lord and of Gideon y'all know the story when they did this it was such a clamor around they went on three sides of the company of the many knights and it was such a amer the Midianites thought that thousands were be falling on them and the Bible said that they the hosts of them cried and fled and they they dropped their weapons they dropped everything and just fled who was it to meet him who put the fear in their heart it was God and it only took him three hundred men to do it and some pictures and some trumpets they they never had to raise a hand imagine them coming back after this and telling the ones those 22,000 that were afraid and turned back so how did y'all do it we blew on trumpets and break pitchers what you mean you didn't have to fight oh boy I should stay you know we didn't need you because there was one other ingredient we had we had to have faith that this was what the Lord said to do and that in doing that he was going to deliver us so we didn't need no faithless ones down there with us the Branham says God always sends a prophet to bring deliverance to his people and I believe there's a bit of deliverance brought to us in this day the RAM said of modern-day prophet was a preacher I believe God sends preachers to bring deliverance and what do we have to do do like those 300 did with Gideon just listen to what the Lord has instructed them what the Lord gives them to say didn't listen to it how am I going to overcome this disease listen to what the Lord's got to say how am I going to overcome this sickness listen to what the Lord's going to say the real man of God will always point you back to the word you know that real man of God he many times you don't know what all he goes through and suffers in order to to be there to be before the Lord to bring you the word of the Lord Paul I think of the Apostle Paul he suffered many things Paul said that he was thrice beaten with rods once he was stoned thrice he was shipwrecked day and a night had been in too deep he was in journey often perils of water and pearls of robbers and perils of countrymen in peril of heathens and peril in the city and perils in the wilderness perils in the sea perils in the false brother Willard weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and necklace nakedness and he said there was one place that the governor had sent out a degree to catch Paul and they had to let Paul down I'm a skewed out of the city that he get extinct and Paul said in all this when he talked to the Corinthians he says I have not been a burden on you gideon as i said didn't feel like a mighty man of Valor when he looked at himself he said he didn't look like no mighty man valor means that courage boldness bravery he didn't feel like this maybe you look tonight and say well I don't feel like no mighty person of Valor I don't feel like no mighty Christian how often do we ever feel like a mighty Christian we don't ever want to get to a place where we get lifted up and think I've got this took care of I've got this under control we always want to be dependent on him it wasn't we have not I sent the brother branham said he spoke to Gideon get him was a little surprised he said now mighty man of Valor he didn't know he was maybe you don't know you are you might be one of those mighty men of valor tonight sitting here you you say in this little church this small group yes it's not in numbers there was only two there him and his daddy and there's only has to be 2 here you in Christ that's all it takes to be a mighty man of Valor you and Christ you're not facing the world alone you got Jesus with he said I'm never leaving them forsake you even to the end of the world how do we know God's with us Gideon said if God be with us words all the miracles where the Brenham said it knows about all things he said now are we the sons of God not will be we are now and you people that's born again and you let the devil kick you around like a football how many how often we let the devil kick us around get to feeling like we're all alone well I'm the only one that's going through this particular trial oh poor you sometimes people get to thinking with their trial is worse than in each other trial anybody else is going through you just wouldn't understand you sound like a teenager grow up realize we all face things we all go through things and it's the same Lord Jesus that delivers me is the same one that delivers you same one to deliver the next person it doesn't matter what the problem is we've got the same Lord and he's Almighty there's nothing it's too big for him don't that there's nothing too small that's beyond his concern he cares about the least little bitty thing but concerns you the Lord allows us to go through things so he can prove his love to us so he can prove he's there for us he wants to be near us he wants us to have faith and courage that he's the one that's going to bring us through he wants us to have faith in Courage look you can do all you want to try to reach your family but it's not your efforts it's your testimony it'll take God to reach them but your testimony is the greatest thing that God speaks through what is your family to think about how do they consider what you think about Church like I said earlier where's all the miracles now is a time of healing now it's the time of miracles but how bad do we want the miracle I think about the Shunammite woman remember heard her husband he prayed for his son and the Prophet blessed them and they had a son and the woman told her husband said make build a room on to our house that when the man of God passes through he can tarry in this room he can pray in this room he can sleep in this room so he did and the boy grew and one day the boy was out in the field with his father I don't know the financial status of this woman and her husband but they did have servants I know that and the boy was out there and the Bible said that all of a sudden he said my head my head and fell over and the father told one of the servants says take the boy back to his mother so they took the boy back to the mom and she held him in her arms no doubt you know the way of mother would do petting his his head trying to see what is wrong and he had a fever cheating him what to do and then very little bit of time he passed according to the story in the bottle the woman did not become all shook up she didn't become all frazzled and fall apart but instead she took the little boy lady men on the bed in the room that they've prepared for the man of God then she told her husband I've got to make a journey I've got to get the man of God and this journey I don't know how long it took but it wouldn't have been a smooth journey they saddled up a little mount and begin to take her across the the road on her journey just to find the man of God and the servant of the Prophet said here comes that woman that you prayed and they had a son he said go ask her house all with her husband and house houses everything with her son you know her reply reply was all as well that's why I say she wasn't all tore up she wasn't all worried all was well why because she had faith God had spoke through this prophet and give her the son and she had faith that God would work through the Prophet and bring back her son she was in need of a miracle I don't know how long the journey took her but her son was laying there dead she had need of a miracle from God and she wasn't struggling with doubt in the story well I wonder you know whether I'll get this miracle or not no all is well he said take my staff from go lay it on the boy she said no no I ain't going to that ain't going to work you've got to come and so the Prophet wind and when he arrived there why he went on into the room where the boy laid he shut the door here was a mother and father out there waiting maybe many of you some of you have been there before waiting out in the area of the hospital why something's going on behind closed doors with your loved one you know and that God needs to work a miracle if they're going to make it and you know what's going on back there woman their husband they didn't know what the Prophet was doing back they didn't know what was going on they waited and they waited no sound was coming from the room and they waited some more maybe might have been the dad might have been pacing the floor a little bit I don't know what you're doing back there but maybe mother was like well it doesn't matter what he's doing back there he's here now they don't matter what he's doing back there he's gonna do it I just know when he walks out that door my boy it's gonna be alright cuz I prayed and I believe and he's here now God's here now see how how is it gonna work about this miracle my life it doesn't matter he's here now he prayed over the boy nothing happened then he laid down on the boy nose to nose mouth to mouth his hands on the boys hands and he breathed three times and the boy came to live imagine when he come walking back out of that room with that boy alive again she had need of a miracle and God provided a miracle he said I'm the LORD thy God that provided all of my needs you're a mighty people of valor there's been things that I know about there's a lot many things I'm sure I don't know about that you've been through as a body believers here I started out here with you I know some of the things you faced back then and I'm knowing some of the things you faced sins but look where you're at look where you're at you're here fear didn't cause you to leave you're here because you have faith and faith that this is where God put you have faith that this is where God's gonna deal with you had faith this is where God's gonna get you ready ones friends I'll tell you what we're at the end time I remember when I was a young boy we were approaching the end time but now I look around to things that happen in the government the things that happen around the world in world news and we're at the end say how many more years I don't know could be five could be ten I don't know how many more years but we're where things are starting to fall into place to utter in the time of the tribulation things are beginning to fall in place spiritually to usher in the rapture thruster in the resurrection of the Dead we don't want to follow it now we don't want to faint now amen I'm looking forward to those time I'm looking forward to the coming of the Lord I'm looking forward to when the dead in Christ will rise I believe there's peace beyond the river amen that's what I'm that's what I'm waiting for that and if the anticipation amen let's stand the only father we think you tonight did you come Lord and took time to be with us it took time to speak to us tonight

years ago I got to looking at that Scripture we're married turn there to there she said how shall these things be you know just a spear the Lord spoke to my heart and said take that word how and change them and rearrange the letters when you take the word how and you rearrange the letters you find out who the how is not important it's the who it's who that's what's important not how who because the who will take care of the house without who we wonder how but when who is in charge who is the person then who will see the how so what's important is is the who of the house that right amen that's that's so precious little things like that it just means so much to you because you see it in your life we see it in our lives Amen I'm so thankful to the Lord for that amen we're so thank
