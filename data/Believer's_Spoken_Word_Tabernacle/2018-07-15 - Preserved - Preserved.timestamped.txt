[35:11] we certainly just so grateful for His
[35:14] grace
[35:16] let's turn in our Bibles if we could to
[35:19] Romans chapter 9
[35:47] verse 25 if we could begin reading there
[35:51] I just want to read a few verses of
[35:52] scripture verse 25 Romans 9 as he saith
[36:00] also in Hosea I will call them my people
[36:05] which were not my people and her beloved
[36:10] which was not beloved it shall come to
[36:14] pass that in the place where it was said
[36:16] unto them you're not my people there
[36:20] shall they be called the children of the
[36:23] Living God
[36:25] Isaiah also cried concerning Israel
[36:29] though the number of the children of
[36:31] Israel be as the sand of the sea a
[36:35] remnant shall be saved for he will
[36:40] finish the work and cut it short in
[36:43] righteousness because a short work were
[36:47] the Lord make upon the earth as Isaiah
[36:50] said before except the Lord of Sabaoth
[36:53] had left us a seed we had been as Sodom
[36:59] and made like unto Gomorrha a man I'd
[37:05] like to speak to you on a thought
[37:08] called preserved preserved let's just
[37:14] bow our heads and word of Prayer
[37:19] Lord Jesus there's not one of us Lord
[37:25] that ever gathered here this morning
[37:29] Lord are those that would even Lord be
[37:32] at home be streaming this sort would
[37:34] archive it later there's not one of us
[37:37] that can say that we don't have need of
[37:40] you
[37:41] but father day by day the more that you
[37:47] work in our lives just the more helpless
[37:52] we realize that we are in ourselves and
[37:55] we see Lord God the greatness of what it
[38:00] is to trust you because Lord we are your
[38:04] workmanship Lord you started this work
[38:08] in our lives you will finish apart
[38:11] performing it to the day of Jesus Christ
[38:14] this is Lord our rest is in you we pray
[38:19] Heavenly Father this morning that you
[38:21] would just move among us and speak to us
[38:25] in a very personal way Lord there's no
[38:28] way that I can deliver the thoughts that
[38:31] have been so accumulated on my heart
[38:33] from the past few days Lord but father
[38:36] I'm trusting you that Lord gave the
[38:39] inspiration as it dropped Lord one
[38:42] thought after another that you would
[38:44] deliver Lord father to our hearts and
[38:47] may you find hearts that are open Lord
[38:50] and may we be so transformed Lord God
[38:53] and changed
[38:54] Lord God here this morning we pray Lord
[38:58] God for every need that's here for every
[39:00] sickness Lord for Lord whether it be of
[39:03] a sickness in the physical realm or God
[39:06] or on the spiritual realm Lord
[39:08] either that in the body or that in the
[39:10] soul order in the spirit father you are
[39:14] our healer Lord I pray that God that you
[39:18] would just move on
[39:19] the Lord God may our hearts be warmed in
[39:22] your presence Lord and drawn to you I
[39:25] pray in a great tenderness Lord father
[39:28] with a desire to be more fervent Lord in
[39:32] the name of Jesus Christ we ask you Lord
[39:34] in Jesus name Amen
[39:37] god bless you be seated
[39:48] some of you know some of you maybe
[39:50] didn't know this past week my family and
[39:55] I we had had it kind of it had it
[39:57] planned out for vacation and I think my
[40:00] wife for doing that in planning it
[40:01] because those things if it was left up
[40:04] to me to be planned out he'd never get
[40:05] done and I'm glad she did that and some
[40:12] things that I want to just kind of just
[40:14] just take a pause from some of the other
[40:16] things that we have been dealing with
[40:17] Lord willing we'll resume here on that
[40:21] but during this time you know I it was
[40:24] truly a time of a great refreshment and
[40:28] rest I probably one of the I told my
[40:30] wife I and told others I said I think
[40:32] it's the best vacation I've ever had and
[40:34] my wife said honey it's the only
[40:36] vacation that we have taken and then
[40:41] that's true most of the time you know
[40:43] the family when you know the Lord would
[40:45] lay it upon the heart to go and maybe do
[40:48] meeting somewhere I'm so focused even
[40:50] before going to those meetings that you
[40:53] know it probably is really isn't much
[40:55] fun you know I'm just focused on that
[40:58] and sometimes we may take a day here or
[41:00] there but after that you're always so
[41:02] spent and you are just it's such a
[41:04] relief and but I really do think God for
[41:07] this time that we had together and as I
[41:11] stood there we were over there in the
[41:12] state of Pennsylvania and you're
[41:14] Lancaster and we went to we went to a
[41:16] place which is probably pretty common to
[41:19] many of you as that as known as
[41:22] Gettysburg and I stood there we went on
[41:27] multiple sites and climbed multiple
[41:30] places went through the battlefield over
[41:34] three days just taking in everything
[41:37] standing in places and listening to
[41:40] Rangers and different ones described it
[41:43] listening to orators and reading things
[41:46] throughout the
[41:47] museum and those things that were there
[41:49] and I'll just be very honest with you it
[41:53] was overwhelmingly sobering it was
[41:59] places of great somber I turned to one
[42:01] man who was there at the place of really
[42:06] what was known as Pickett's Charge and I
[42:07] turned to the man I said you know four
[42:09] days I said this has been very sombering
[42:11] and the man looked at me he said I've
[42:13] been here multiple times he said there's
[42:15] not a day that I don't come here or a
[42:17] year that it's not still sombering
[42:20] because you you realize where you're
[42:23] standing that there are not just lives
[42:26] they've been given but the calls and I
[42:29] looked upon these things and there was
[42:31] much inspiration that really began to
[42:35] drop in the heart within the last day
[42:38] that we were there and things just began
[42:40] to just mount up and my wife I handed
[42:43] her my phone on the way out and I told
[42:45] her I said just start typing certain
[42:47] points that I'm giving to you just type
[42:49] and I'll I'll pick it up later a lot of
[42:52] times she does that for me and I it
[42:55] doesn't make much sense to her but it
[42:56] does to me when it's dropping and so so
[42:59] I had her to to take those things down
[43:01] there are many things that even as we
[43:03] were coming there I was journeying there
[43:06] we went to to Lancaster first and we
[43:10] were journeying there and the thought
[43:11] kept striking my heart on preserved and
[43:13] I had no idea that this is something
[43:17] what was going to evolve out of this or
[43:19] that inspiration that I would be
[43:20] speaking this I was just thinking on the
[43:22] fault merely of inspiration and this is
[43:25] the thought that I was I was just
[43:27] reflecting in my meditation was
[43:30] throughout even the time that we were
[43:32] there in Lancaster I was just I was
[43:35] thinking in this thought line over what
[43:37] is true preservation and I was thinking
[43:40] this what does it mean to be preserved
[43:42] and how is it that God preserves his
[43:46] outworking in the fulfillment of his
[43:49] message those thoughts I set there we
[43:53] were we were at a place there in
[43:56] Lancaster and those thoughts I was just
[43:58] meditating on those thoughts and and
[43:59] reflecting on that
[44:01] and I begin to think of these things and
[44:04] that the word preserved then it began to
[44:07] strike me on the way out of Gettysburg
[44:09] there the other morning and I think of
[44:12] things that were brother Branham he
[44:14] refers in this hour that we're living in
[44:18] he speaks in 1954 he'll speak in prayer
[44:23] into the Lord and he'll make a statement
[44:25] where he says I were happy to know that
[44:28] the man's blood is down through the ages
[44:31] though it costs that blood we're sorry
[44:34] that it cost it but it brought this
[44:37] Bible that it does it to us tonight as
[44:41] free literature and we can read it as
[44:43] American citizens and have a right to
[44:46] worship you according to the dictates of
[44:49] our conscience the way we read the word
[44:52] and we're thankful for our nation and
[44:56] for our people and for the freedom that
[44:59] we have you see friends these are
[45:01] something you know that it's not just
[45:03] something those of you that have known
[45:05] me you know the stand I'm not just
[45:07] looking at the doctrine that God has
[45:10] brought to us and restoring these great
[45:12] truths one thing that I look at i watch
[45:15] how brother branham's approaches on
[45:17] things those are many of the things that
[45:20] I'll study behind it's me it's more than
[45:22] words there's a stairs that there's an
[45:24] approach of things and it's a character
[45:27] and I want my character to be shaped and
[45:31] I believe it is by the same Living God
[45:33] who shaped the character of the Prophet
[45:35] that's my desire because this is to me
[45:39] what makes this the message so glorious
[45:42] is is to even see how that what we were
[45:46] what was brought to us was not just
[45:48] something that we were told to do this
[45:52] and don't do this and don't do that but
[45:54] it's it's much greater than that what
[45:57] was brought to us by the presence of the
[45:59] Living God God even brought it on
[46:02] display in the life of the Prophet he
[46:05] brought it on display and I I there's
[46:08] more than I could say within that but I
[46:10] I come to this point where brother brems
[46:12] says we're thankful for a nation
[46:14] and for our people and for the freedom
[46:17] that we have and we pray that you'll
[46:20] preserve this Lord I look at this and I
[46:26] think of statements many things begin to
[46:29] ring in my heart even as I stood there
[46:31] in the National Cemetery and then on the
[46:33] way back and things just begin to
[46:35] accumulate I thought of the freedoms we
[46:38] enjoy and the prophet of God in this
[46:41] hour he pointed out and it wasn't just
[46:43] something that was said loosely it was
[46:48] shown within the scriptures of where we
[46:52] are you understand there were men than
[46:55] all that had even during the time where
[46:58] the Prophet was here and those that had
[47:00] been before it where they had made a
[47:03] different announcements that the coming
[47:05] of the Lord is here and it's gonna
[47:07] happen in this particular state and it's
[47:09] gonna happen in this city and all of
[47:11] those things no doubt both men were
[47:14] inspired but their inspiration was not
[47:17] according to the channel of God's Word
[47:19] it's like this when you look at a map I
[47:23] think here we were we elected not to do
[47:27] there and I'm now give you my our whole
[47:29] vacation thing but I want you to
[47:30] understand this we elected not to do the
[47:33] bus tour because to do the bus tour of
[47:36] the battlefields it's two hours long I
[47:38] don't want to just mean I want to walk
[47:40] in these places some of these places
[47:43] that you might seem well this is
[47:44] important but there's other places that
[47:46] I want to just I want to get out and
[47:48] walk I want to move in some of these
[47:50] places I want to just take some of the
[47:52] sin so here we are we're listening to an
[47:54] audio dramatization and these points
[47:56] that are being made within these places
[47:58] and as I'm looking at the map the one
[48:01] time I had the map well I seen the map I
[48:03] seen the route of the audio tour on the
[48:05] map but the problem was is that where I
[48:07] was at and how the audio tour map was
[48:10] depicted here I needed to turn it the
[48:13] right way because of where I was
[48:16] positioned and and I didn't realize that
[48:19] and Here I am I'm going around and
[48:20] thinking where is the starting pot spot
[48:22] for this where where is the starting
[48:24] spot you know and I'm just looking at
[48:26] and I realized
[48:27] you know then it dawns on me and once it
[48:29] dawns on me once I turn it I said oh I
[48:32] see it now and I'm so thankful that God
[48:35] came in this hour and this map that you
[48:38] and I have this blueprint that I
[48:40] couldn't see where I was at I didn't
[48:42] know who I was but he said turn the
[48:44] picture like this and and then I can
[48:47] begin to see him and I see who who he is
[48:50] I see Christ being revealed
[48:52] I recognized God's voice in this hour I
[48:55] think God for that it took God to come
[48:58] and say turn it oh okay now I know where
[49:02] I'm at now I know where I'm at
[49:05] it's a big help to know where you're at
[49:07] because then you can know what next road
[49:08] to look for brother Brown made a
[49:11] statement and in in in admonishing us in
[49:13] Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[49:15] told us that these when we think of this
[49:18] this statement of the Lord may you
[49:21] preserve this freedom and when I think
[49:25] of that a look at how that brother told
[49:27] us in Christ the mystery that these
[49:29] gatherings that we are having now and in
[49:33] might I say oh just like this they will
[49:36] be fond memories he spoken that message
[49:42] and went through other places and let us
[49:45] know within this hour let me tell you
[49:47] something this was not the wisdom of a
[49:49] man this is the wisdom of God when he
[49:54] would take messages live like the 3rd
[49:57] Exodus and speak to us bringing all the
[49:59] way up from the scriptures and show us
[50:02] what happened in Egypt was a parallel
[50:05] and a prophecy of this hour where just
[50:08] as it was in Egypt they would raise up a
[50:11] pharaoh who knew not Joseph and he would
[50:15] begin to persecute the children of
[50:17] Israel but yet all of that was under
[50:20] God's plan because Israel had to get
[50:23] back into her homeland so all of these
[50:26] things being identified of what you and
[50:29] I are seeing taking place around us I
[50:32] really believe this with all of my heart
[50:35] that without God giving the light of
[50:38] this message in the hour we would be
[50:41] nothing but guessers and presume errs
[50:45] and assuming things and wondering and
[50:48] I'll tell you this here without an
[50:50] anchoring in the heart we would be
[50:52] filled with fear listen them but the
[50:54] Bible is clear men's hearts are failing
[50:57] for fear never before has the drugs and
[51:03] everything and I'm not talking about
[51:04] street drugs I'm talking about
[51:06] prescription drugs never has it been but
[51:12] you see it's like an undercurrent
[51:13] wherein they cannot put a hold upon it
[51:16] but remember just as nature is
[51:19] experiencing her nervous frustrations
[51:22] for the event that is upon us in the in
[51:26] the in in the coming of the Millennium
[51:28] the tribulation so is the world though
[51:31] they don't recognize what's going on
[51:33] they're aware something is soon is to
[51:36] take place and let me say this to you
[51:38] it's an old story it's been told a long
[51:42] time but there is a literal Jesus and
[51:45] there is a literal coming hallelujah and
[51:52] it's in this time this hour that Peter
[51:55] could prophetically speak by the Spirit
[51:58] of God and saying that people would look
[52:00] and say Oh things continue on as they
[52:03] always have
[52:04] with no alert to what's going on I think
[52:10] God for light in this hour I think God
[52:16] for this message that he sent to us I
[52:24] consider it how that the Prophet he I
[52:28] told Paul we were standing there in one
[52:31] place he and I were together in the
[52:32] National Cemetery we were standing there
[52:34] and I told him I said Paul I want you to
[52:37] look at this here you have and here you
[52:41] have at this place
[52:42] was the turning point of the Civil War
[52:53] this might be a matter of opinion and
[52:55] that's fine but you know when you look
[53:04] at generally in them and those those men
[53:07] that had continuously won and such
[53:12] calculating such they had all they had a
[53:15] lot of wisdom are you with me but one
[53:20] move you take Stonewall Jackson that's
[53:23] killed in the battle before then he
[53:26] falls back on to Longstreet and I'm not
[53:28] here to give you a history lesson I'm
[53:30] just trying to show you this one point I
[53:32] stood there and I told Paul so Paul do
[53:35] you realize that there's no way it could
[53:37] have been two nations I said what was it
[53:41] that stepped in sovereignly and even
[53:44] where these men would take these
[53:45] positions to where even the North the
[53:48] Union would get there first and take the
[53:50] high ground what was that that's the
[53:53] sovereignty of God because the
[53:55] Scriptures did not say to lambs it said
[53:58] there was a lamb who rose up it was not
[54:02] a North in the South it was a lamb that
[54:04] Rosa you see God he's watching over his
[54:07] word hallelujah
[54:10] it could not be it could not happen in
[54:12] that way and that's exactly as you look
[54:15] at the prophet standing in this hour and
[54:18] he's able to identify the trumpets that
[54:21] have met have been blown he's able to
[54:23] look at it and say what was it that
[54:25] caused that world were warned to stop on
[54:28] the eleventh month and the eleventh day
[54:30] at the eleventh hour at the 11th minute
[54:33] what was it nobody else knows they don't
[54:36] understand but that was the signal that
[54:39] this is the final outpouring of the Holy
[54:43] Ghost the final visitation to the
[54:46] Gentile the 11th hour worker as spoken
[54:50] of in the scriptures you see this way
[54:54] let me say this to you this is one thing
[54:57] this message it will not take you
[54:59] outside of the scripture
[55:01] it'll place you in the scripture you
[55:04] might be looking at something but all
[55:07] you got to do is follow him and he'll
[55:09] turn it and you see where to make the
[55:11] turns it places it perfectly of where
[55:16] we're at that you and I can see where
[55:19] we're at
[55:25] we're living in that day even where you
[55:28] look I don't have time to read all of
[55:30] these scriptures but in Revelation 7
[55:34] here in the latter part of verse 6 it's
[55:37] speaking of the tribulation that's
[55:40] breaking upon the earth but then it
[55:42] immediately goes in the beginning of
[55:43] Revelation 7 and it's speaks of God's
[55:47] pace of grace that where he will not
[55:50] allow all of this to be consumed and
[55:53] wiped off until he has sealed the
[55:57] servants of God speaking of the Jews you
[56:01] see the Jews were not in Palestine and
[56:04] to think of it even in this age listen
[56:08] to me now we're men from even other
[56:11] places and where that that little place
[56:15] of Israel a little country if I put it
[56:17] upon a map you could look at that map
[56:19] and you could overlook it's just a small
[56:21] little thing let me tell you something
[56:23] it's not about the size it's God who is
[56:26] with her it's not about your size it's
[56:31] the God who is behind you hallelujah
[56:33] when you're standing on his side then
[56:36] you can say if God be for us who can be
[56:40] against us one of the one little nation
[56:45] and yet God notice God's he's faithful
[56:48] to perform his word I trust that we can
[56:51] take such a hope in this this morning
[56:53] aloud the Spirit of God to minister this
[56:55] tree down to your need and don't just
[56:57] leave it up here to realize that
[56:59] everything that's needed in your life
[57:02] and in my life it's not going to be me
[57:04] and you putting ourselves in place it is
[57:07] God Himself that is placing his children
[57:11] for
[57:11] not only did he give a message to call
[57:14] us out but within this same message is
[57:17] our inheritance a man it is the Moses
[57:21] Commission and the Joshua Commission
[57:24] hallelujah
[57:25] it's what's in there and everything that
[57:28] you have need of healing in your body
[57:29] deliverance the Holy Ghost
[57:31] everything everything all of that
[57:34] positioning he is the one who brings us
[57:37] to that place doesn't force it think of
[57:44] this and I spoke on that here with the
[57:48] Jews and how that that airline how that
[57:52] they move them back to the homeland and
[57:55] they begin to make secret missions and
[57:58] rendevouz to get them back there in
[58:00] their homeland never before was she
[58:04] recognized as a nation but here she is
[58:08] she has her own flag
[58:10] she has representation I'm asking you
[58:14] who did that that's God because he said
[58:17] in his word that that the fig tree when
[58:21] you want to know what time it is look at
[58:24] the fig tree if you want to know what
[58:27] time it is whether you're early for work
[58:29] late for work or it's lunchtime or
[58:31] whatever more you've got a clock to go
[58:33] by God gave a timepiece that the
[58:36] believer could look at and you recognize
[58:39] when you're looking at Israel hey this
[58:42] is a promise and we're living here in
[58:44] this time and I'll ghosts much to say
[58:48] this right here if there's no other
[58:50] reason why that the man who was put in
[58:53] presidential power if there was no other
[58:55] reason for this nation than to declare
[58:58] that Jerusalem is the capital and move
[59:01] the embassy
[59:02] if this for no other reason let me tell
[59:04] you about this right here
[59:06] that was not the voting booth that was
[59:08] not the Electoral College
[59:10] it is the sovereignty of God for the
[59:13] Scriptures declare that God lets powers
[59:16] be that be the Bible said that he lifts
[59:19] up Athenian
[59:20] you'll take down a team so we need not
[59:25] be focused on who is king who isn't king
[59:29] who could be we need to be focused and
[59:31] make sure that Jesus Christ is our King
[59:35] [Applause]
[59:37] because of this kingdom there is no in
[59:44] [Applause]
[59:47] so when I think of this passage of
[59:51] Scripture that was so inspiring to my
[59:55] heart as were just we're leaving out of
[59:57] there I thought of how that they found a
[1:00:01] grain of wheat that was in the Garner's
[1:00:05] of Egypt from the days of Joseph you
[1:00:10] remember Joseph he's not fully aware of
[1:00:14] why he's in Egypt
[1:00:15] he's been sold into slavery has been
[1:00:17] rejected of his brothers I don't have
[1:00:19] time to go through all of these parts
[1:00:21] because I know some are not aware of
[1:00:23] these types that are sitting here but
[1:00:25] that was all the portrayal of the
[1:00:28] redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:31] he was rejected of his brethren but
[1:00:36] while he was away he took a Gentile
[1:00:39] bride when the Gentile bride has put
[1:00:42] away in the palace in rapture of and
[1:00:44] promised of the word then he reveals
[1:00:48] himself to his brethren which is the
[1:00:50] promise laying in the scripture you see
[1:00:52] these are not things that have been
[1:00:54] contrived from the intellects of man or
[1:00:57] from putting man's theology and
[1:01:00] bookstores together no no this is what
[1:01:02] God has already declared in his word and
[1:01:06] God has sent inspiration in this hour
[1:01:09] that these things are not just things
[1:01:12] that are to be but we see them as modern
[1:01:16] events that are made clear by prophecy
[1:01:19] Oh glory be to God I think of this when
[1:01:24] they planted that that kernel of wheat
[1:01:27] that they found from the days of Joseph
[1:01:29] thousands
[1:01:31] of years old but that had the germ of
[1:01:34] life in it they planted it and it
[1:01:39] brought forth the same kind of a crop
[1:01:43] it's showing that germ of life if that
[1:01:45] same life be present Jesus said the
[1:01:50] works that I do shall you do also if you
[1:01:54] planted you bought from the store and
[1:01:56] probably most in this I know there's
[1:01:58] some you know gardeners setting in here
[1:01:59] and things like that I don't want to
[1:02:01] call them professional even though they
[1:02:03] probably are but you know they could
[1:02:04] look at something and say no that's not
[1:02:06] a tomato plant so let us plan to go back
[1:02:08] to the store get we're going to plant
[1:02:09] plant just somewhere else we needed more
[1:02:11] tomato plants but you could look at the
[1:02:14] characteristics you understand if you
[1:02:16] wanted a tomato plant you're not going
[1:02:18] to be acceptable a lettuce plant but how
[1:02:21] do you know what it is plant it and when
[1:02:24] you plan it the germ of life that is
[1:02:27] already there will declare itself god is
[1:02:35] promise and I this is even for those
[1:02:38] it's a good revisiting point for all of
[1:02:42] us but even for some that would be new
[1:02:44] or coming in among us or maybe for your
[1:02:48] heart you've wondered why is this
[1:02:50] speaking of a message what is this it's
[1:02:54] a scriptural term a message it's just
[1:03:00] like when you look at a text message or
[1:03:02] whatever more it's something that's
[1:03:03] intended and it's sent a message God has
[1:03:08] already had it laying here but when the
[1:03:12] Holy Spirit comes upon it he sends it
[1:03:16] he said I've sent my word and it will
[1:03:19] not return back to me void are you with
[1:03:23] me and there is a text thread that is
[1:03:26] then open and many prophecies and things
[1:03:29] of the scriptures begin to be linked
[1:03:31] together and you no longer just have one
[1:03:34] little part but now a picture is
[1:03:37] beginning to come forth a whole thread
[1:03:39] begins to open up a scarlet
[1:03:42] all the way through the scriptures where
[1:03:45] you see the blood all the way through
[1:03:49] the plan of redemption why because this
[1:03:52] is no longer we're not just looking and
[1:03:54] saying that's the Bible we see it this
[1:03:56] is the book of redemption this is where
[1:03:59] my name is written it's in here that I
[1:04:02] find my identification it's not just
[1:04:06] history but it's a book of prophecy for
[1:04:09] me
[1:04:13] so God God will send a messenger a
[1:04:22] messenger has a message gotta send a
[1:04:28] prophet I want you to think of this how
[1:04:31] a channel of inspiration will become
[1:04:35] open because as the Prophet placed it in
[1:04:40] one place and the message the rapture
[1:04:42] you find this see this is the thing you
[1:04:45] find this all the way through the Old
[1:04:47] Testament when the Israel would get away
[1:04:50] and they would get away from their
[1:04:53] inheritance
[1:04:54] you see inheritance is more than just
[1:04:57] living on the land that belongs to you
[1:05:00] but inheritance is having everything
[1:05:04] that belongs to you let me tell you
[1:05:06] something there was something much more
[1:05:08] valuable than the dirt they were
[1:05:10] standing on and that was the presence of
[1:05:13] the Living God there's nothing more
[1:05:16] valuable than the presence of Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ this Bible and I think God for it
[1:05:26] I think God how many could carry this
[1:05:29] how many places that it's in and from
[1:05:31] what I was told you know brother Mike
[1:05:34] Seaver was sharing it with me here a
[1:05:35] couple of weeks ago they actually told
[1:05:37] him don't send Bibles in that have thin
[1:05:41] paper because when you send them into
[1:05:43] the prison they tear out the pages and
[1:05:46] roll them up for cigarettes because that
[1:05:48] paper makes good but let me tell you
[1:05:50] something that's not everybody
[1:05:52] there might be let me tell you something
[1:05:54] there might have been many that where
[1:05:57] that's what happened to it but I believe
[1:05:59] with all my heart there's some lives
[1:06:01] that have been touched by God coming
[1:06:05] down and bringing conviction and turning
[1:06:08] their hearts around and they begin to
[1:06:10] value more than paper they value the God
[1:06:14] who inspired the word and brought the
[1:06:17] mix into the heart to where they would
[1:06:19] come to know that there is someone there
[1:06:22] is someone who cares there is someone
[1:06:26] who can do something about my situation
[1:06:29] because let me tell you something
[1:06:31] there's a greater prison than any
[1:06:34] federal prison there's a greater jail
[1:06:37] than any local county jail and that is
[1:06:39] the prison cell of unbelief in your
[1:06:43] heart where you're bound in unbelief
[1:06:47] where but there has already been a price
[1:06:50] that's been paid and let me just tell
[1:06:53] you this right here the keys not a
[1:06:55] hidden key it's a simple key that will
[1:06:58] unlock the door his faith in what you
[1:07:02] are hearing that's a living God who is
[1:07:05] touching my heart that's for me that
[1:07:08] freedom that Liberty that's for me and
[1:07:11] you watch by the key of faith if thou
[1:07:14] canst believe all things are possible
[1:07:17] that key if hey we'll unlock the door
[1:07:21] that you can walk free I think God for
[1:07:27] that there's a channel of inspiration
[1:07:38] the profit
[1:07:41] directed by the holy ghost leads us into
[1:07:47] this place where David would see the
[1:07:54] need to bring the ark back to Ark of the
[1:07:56] Covenant back to Jerusalem you see where
[1:07:59] the Ark of the Covenant was here the
[1:08:01] presence of the Lord would come the Ark
[1:08:04] of the Lord the Urim all these things
[1:08:06] listen to me what's this watch the Urim
[1:08:09] in the days of Saul the Urim where they
[1:08:12] would go before and these the lights the
[1:08:15] BRIT on the breastplate of the high
[1:08:17] priests when something was to be spoken
[1:08:19] a dream something was to be said or they
[1:08:22] were needing needing to know God's will
[1:08:23] they were to bring that before that Urim
[1:08:26] and someone but the Bible says in the
[1:08:28] days of Saul
[1:08:29] they stopped consulting the Urim and the
[1:08:33] Sun watch this the Prophet picks this up
[1:08:38] here the Spirit of God points this out
[1:08:39] these are not just loose statements that
[1:08:42] are in their scriptures but he points it
[1:08:43] out that that's why David even acted the
[1:08:46] way he did and when David looking at the
[1:08:48] Ark of God needs to come back he said he
[1:08:50] had the right motive and right objective
[1:08:52] and I believe that's always something
[1:08:53] that were to check because the motive
[1:08:58] and objective is something that can be
[1:09:02] sensed behind it he said David had got
[1:09:06] this revelation he had the right motive
[1:09:09] he had the right objective listen to me
[1:09:11] it was the will of God to bring it back
[1:09:14] to Jerusalem the Prophet brings it over
[1:09:17] and he says see it is God's will for a
[1:09:21] revival in this generation
[1:09:25] but he's separating it so that you and I
[1:09:28] might see here must there is an
[1:09:30] appropriate Channel David consulted
[1:09:33] thousands and the Prophet said the
[1:09:34] reason he did that is because the Urim
[1:09:37] had been done away with in the days of
[1:09:39] salt let me just say it like this habits
[1:09:41] can become habits very quickly that's
[1:09:45] why we don't want to be habit people I'm
[1:09:49] talking about in our walk with God if
[1:09:51] you put your keys always on the coffee
[1:09:52] table on that time like that do it in
[1:09:55] otherwise you who knows you may read
[1:09:57] your bike to work I'm talking about that
[1:10:01] that serving God is not something that
[1:10:04] that we desire or should we ever we
[1:10:07] ought to be sensitive that it doesn't
[1:10:09] become a habit it ought to be a love
[1:10:15] affair and and there's all sorts of the
[1:10:17] conditions of this age that are there to
[1:10:21] try to pull you and tear you away from
[1:10:23] that all of us so we're not let's not be
[1:10:26] ignorant of that but let us be conscious
[1:10:28] of this right here to say Lord this age
[1:10:32] is truly an age unfit for humans to live
[1:10:36] but you are still God it was unfit for
[1:10:41] Daniel to live in the da lion's den but
[1:10:44] you were there with him it was not a fit
[1:10:47] place for Daniel and the rest of the be
[1:10:50] believers there in Babylon has he stood
[1:10:52] there on the cabinet but you were with
[1:10:55] him
[1:10:56] you see it's inviting God on the scene
[1:11:00] calling Jesus on the scene for your need
[1:11:04] in your life in your situation he's a
[1:11:07] personal God to every one of us
[1:11:11] that's his desire so here there has to
[1:11:15] be a channel of inspiration that's open
[1:11:18] blue Bram's talks about how he said them
[1:11:21] ecclesiastical groups in the message
[1:11:23] rapture they'd get everything all mixed
[1:11:26] up and he would send a prophet raise him
[1:11:29] up from nowhere
[1:11:32] as Bible readers you know that you try
[1:11:36] to trace back where Elijah come from
[1:11:39] it's like they step out of nowhere you
[1:11:44] know what it was listen to me very
[1:11:45] carefully
[1:11:45] they were nobodies there was nothing
[1:11:49] revered about them oh this is gonna be a
[1:11:51] great orator this man's gonna be a great
[1:11:54] speaker someday this man on the contrary
[1:11:57] God takes weaklings people who are
[1:12:01] despised why would he do that that he
[1:12:05] might manifest his glory I love that my
[1:12:13] prayer is is just as the Prophet over
[1:12:15] and over reiterated in perfect strength
[1:12:17] throughout that message God let me die
[1:12:24] the Prophet made that a prayer unto God
[1:12:27] for what he said God the revival that's
[1:12:30] coming on there's no way that I can do
[1:12:32] this but Lord it'll take your strength
[1:12:34] so let me move back that's the same way
[1:12:38] with a rapture that's the same way in
[1:12:40] everyday life that's the same way in
[1:12:41] every whatever your need in situation is
[1:12:43] it's the same way this morning all you
[1:12:45] can have to say is Lord help me to get
[1:12:47] out of the way he'd send a prophet raise
[1:12:53] him up for know where he belonged listen
[1:12:56] this this is important he belonged to
[1:12:58] none of their situations he should have
[1:13:03] said denominations no situations is
[1:13:05] appropriate because it's situations now
[1:13:08] he belonged he belonged to none of their
[1:13:10] situations and speak his word I'm
[1:13:14] standing there and some of you I know
[1:13:16] that are no doubt very versed on this
[1:13:19] and my son Paul he knows things when we
[1:13:24] goes down through different things he
[1:13:26] associates things by by dates of events
[1:13:28] in history so when I need to know what
[1:13:30] happened on a certain war in this event
[1:13:31] Paul help me
[1:13:33] he can tell me I wish I was better in
[1:13:36] that you know but I'm standing there and
[1:13:44] you know I heard this over and over I
[1:13:47] read it in a museum I heard it over and
[1:13:50] over I heard of the standing at the
[1:13:52] National Cemetery I heard it when we
[1:13:54] were there at the David wills House
[1:13:57] where President Lincoln I stood in the
[1:13:59] bedroom where he put the finishing
[1:14:02] touches on the Gettysburg Address and I
[1:14:06] just stood there and I told my wife I
[1:14:09] told the rest of them I stood there and
[1:14:10] looked the same bedspread you know they
[1:14:13] redid the wallpaper I stood right there
[1:14:15] and I said my to think of this the
[1:14:18] inspiration it fell right here you know
[1:14:24] President Lincoln they have him standing
[1:14:26] out before the people in front of that
[1:14:28] house in that evening after dinner and
[1:14:31] he tells them I don't know what I'm
[1:14:33] gonna say tomorrow you say well I
[1:14:37] thought he had some ideas down there's a
[1:14:39] lot of times I have ideas down but I
[1:14:41] don't know what I'm gonna say you don't
[1:14:43] know you don't know but the inspiration
[1:14:47] I thought I looked at that little table
[1:14:48] I seen that chair and you're just
[1:14:51] looking at all this this is going on and
[1:14:54] you're seeing inspiration things because
[1:14:56] here you find something in this the war
[1:15:00] still going on but here they're going to
[1:15:02] dedicate what has happened on that field
[1:15:04] where men have fallen and they said it
[1:15:07] would equate today of all the lives that
[1:15:09] are lost if it was by our population it
[1:15:11] would equate to six million men that's
[1:15:13] incredible
[1:15:14] that's very sombering but this is a
[1:15:17] point out this is where I was just
[1:15:19] enthralled I kept looking at this there
[1:15:21] was a man by the name of let me get his
[1:15:23] name correct Edward Everett and this man
[1:15:26] is the one whom when David wills was
[1:15:29] inviting them to come and speak and
[1:15:32] dedicate that National Cemetery and all
[1:15:34] these things he was a noted orator of
[1:15:37] the day
[1:15:38] he was well noted he was a college
[1:15:42] president he was a politician he and
[1:15:44] this is the thing the man spoke for two
[1:15:47] hours and what they wrote to Abraham
[1:15:49] Lincoln at the end we would like for you
[1:15:52] to show up but make it a few appropriate
[1:15:55] remarks but see it was expected of this
[1:15:59] Everett fellow it was nothing in those
[1:16:01] days as they said for somebody to speak
[1:16:03] two hours I'm not trying to get that
[1:16:05] back this morning but the people
[1:16:08] expected that and you know this is the
[1:16:12] first time I heard that man's name I
[1:16:15] read about his name the only thing that
[1:16:19] I I've never even read the speech yet
[1:16:21] they say a copy of the speech is out
[1:16:23] there but there's not been active
[1:16:25] guarantee there's not one of you in here
[1:16:26] if you ever had to learn anything about
[1:16:28] Gettysburg and when we would we're
[1:16:30] teaching in school and having the kids
[1:16:31] remember the Gettysburg Address and
[1:16:33] other things like that
[1:16:34] I never ever had them to try to remember
[1:16:36] it because I didn't even know Edward
[1:16:37] Everett
[1:16:39] he's plugged for two hours and the
[1:16:42] Gettysburg Address was two minutes and
[1:16:44] 34 seconds and that included pause for
[1:16:49] applause sale was not a long work that
[1:16:55] was needed it was a short quick work
[1:16:59] hallelujah it was it was the capturing
[1:17:02] of thoughts of what had taken place and
[1:17:05] even Everett itself would write to
[1:17:07] Lincoln and say what I do it took me two
[1:17:10] hours
[1:17:10] you were able to adequately conceive and
[1:17:14] bring forth within two minutes it's not
[1:17:18] the length it's not the quantity it's
[1:17:21] the quality I always thought a brother
[1:17:27] Roy shoes berry god bless her brother
[1:17:31] brother Roy was there that night and you
[1:17:34] know I think was back at it might have
[1:17:35] been back in 96 or somewhere there and
[1:17:37] sitting on the front row in those
[1:17:39] meetings and he said you know brother
[1:17:41] Roy I won't try to go in his voice but
[1:17:42] brother Roy said you know what he said
[1:17:44] the devil can't do anything he said God
[1:17:46] can take the shortest verse of scripture
[1:17:47] in this Bible and whip Satan all over
[1:17:50] this platform so truth jesus wept we can
[1:17:55] preach on God coming down and becoming
[1:17:57] man are you listening we can just take a
[1:18:01] text visa sweat and preach about
[1:18:03] redemptive work Oh Lord but here what's
[1:18:10] in this Gettysburg Address I'm not going
[1:18:13] to read it to you but there's things
[1:18:16] that are mentioned here within this
[1:18:20] where he speaks of a new nation you know
[1:18:23] that how he Abraham now watch the church
[1:18:26] says Abraham Lincoln starts this address
[1:18:29] you might say I didn't think this was a
[1:18:32] history chord this is not a history
[1:18:33] course this morning I'm going somewhere
[1:18:37] he starts by referring back to the
[1:18:43] original motive and objective and the
[1:18:47] original document four score and seven
[1:18:51] years ago
[1:18:52] our fathers brought forth on this
[1:18:55] continent a new nation conceived in
[1:18:58] Liberty and dedicated to the proposition
[1:19:00] that all men are created equal you see
[1:19:04] he was not loosely gathering things
[1:19:07] these weren't just contrived ideas here
[1:19:10] etched back to the original document and
[1:19:16] he's pulling the words that were given
[1:19:19] in the original document and he's
[1:19:21] applying it for right now he's letting
[1:19:25] it be known that our words know that
[1:19:28] they're not gonna be remembered but
[1:19:29] these words are remembered he said
[1:19:32] they're not gonna be remembered but what
[1:19:33] has happened on this field will be
[1:19:35] remembered and he goes on to make this
[1:19:37] of these last few remarks he says here
[1:19:41] he says that wery highly resolve that
[1:19:44] these dead shall not have died in vain
[1:19:54] those lives that risk their lives to
[1:19:58] bring this Bible to where you and I have
[1:20:00] a copy of it
[1:20:01] they died not in vain the profits of all
[1:20:08] that were hacked in pieces and all they
[1:20:11] died not in vain men gallant men the
[1:20:15] Prophet will use those words gallant men
[1:20:18] that it whittled before us I think of
[1:20:20] how brother Ram said the first time I
[1:20:23] stood he said I went to Los Angeles he
[1:20:25] said I remembered Aimee Semple McPherson
[1:20:27] and I wanted to go where she was buried
[1:20:30] and once you think of this listen this
[1:20:32] is a character point he was not
[1:20:35] condoning women preaching you asked me
[1:20:39] this is a character point on this this
[1:20:42] is how to handle these things but he was
[1:20:44] faithful he understood who that that
[1:20:47] light it was limited light that was
[1:20:49] there at that moment but what he
[1:20:51] appreciated was how that her call was
[1:20:56] for a real Holy Ghost life and that's
[1:21:00] what he think God for he went there to
[1:21:03] her two men brother Brent says I got
[1:21:04] many of her
[1:21:05] tapes and books in my office and he also
[1:21:09] think of standing there it might be
[1:21:11] Azusa Jubilee brother brems stands there
[1:21:20] and he talks about her I said I stood
[1:21:22] and aim is simple Macpherson's office
[1:21:25] before coming out here and I think God
[1:21:28] for such a life he goes on he speaks of
[1:21:33] gallant soldiers that have went on
[1:21:36] brother Bram stands up at a prayer
[1:21:38] breakfast and he stands there he says
[1:21:40] thank God for all of these veterans that
[1:21:43] are in here because if they hadn't went
[1:21:48] and laid the groundwork we would not be
[1:21:51] where we are today and I'm telling you
[1:21:54] this let me just put it to you like this
[1:21:56] I thought of this I'm sitting there I'm
[1:21:58] thinking here it is fifty three we're
[1:22:01] standing fifty three years later after
[1:22:03] God has taken home his prophet there's
[1:22:05] things he wanted to see but he knew
[1:22:08] would come to pass so I want to hope I'm
[1:22:11] alive to see her put on those robes of
[1:22:14] Resurrection
[1:22:15] I hope I'm alive to see that revival
[1:22:18] moving in the church we know it was
[1:22:20] starting right then he was he was
[1:22:23] desiring that even to where he would
[1:22:25] make the statements an indictment I'm
[1:22:26] praying and he said it's not hard to
[1:22:28] pray this because it's a promise in
[1:22:30] God's Word that also is a point a
[1:22:34] promise in God's Word is something there
[1:22:36] resonates in the heart of us as
[1:22:38] believers that we pray for the
[1:22:40] fulfillment of that promise I really
[1:22:44] believe if we spent more time praying on
[1:22:46] the fulfillment of God's promise instead
[1:22:49] of so much about our needs I believe the
[1:22:53] presence of God would accompany our
[1:22:55] lives more to give us grace to go
[1:22:57] through our needs I really believe that
[1:23:00] I'm a witness and I believe you are too
[1:23:02] how many times that God has ministered
[1:23:04] to your knee tore my knee and I wasn't
[1:23:06] even praying about my knee I was praying
[1:23:08] about somebody else it's a body you
[1:23:11] can't figure that out that's God God put
[1:23:14] it that way
[1:23:15] oh my men they did not die in vain my
[1:23:26] that's where I think of men that have
[1:23:29] gone on before I'm talking about that
[1:23:33] have carried this message they carried
[1:23:37] it there's no way that we could be where
[1:23:41] we are today listen it wasn't their
[1:23:42] strength but they yielded their strength
[1:23:44] to God like for the lineal under the
[1:23:48] inspiration wrote that song now that the
[1:23:52] title of it slips my mind but the voice
[1:23:55] of living waters and he catches my
[1:23:57] inspiration they forsook their houses
[1:23:59] they forsook their land
[1:24:00] they've how that God had going because
[1:24:04] you know not everybody could be a pastor
[1:24:07] and stay at home sometimes some people
[1:24:13] have to be apostles somebody has to be
[1:24:17] the complete fulfillment of go you into
[1:24:19] all the world and preach the gospel and
[1:24:21] then there's another part within there
[1:24:23] when that's when that work is
[1:24:24] established there God appoints a man to
[1:24:26] oversee that work are you with me
[1:24:29] so it's God's working it's it's not man
[1:24:31] it's God's working I thank God for all
[1:24:34] those lives you you realize this friends
[1:24:37] let me just say this to you very
[1:24:39] personally there's no way on my ministry
[1:24:42] alone or this church make it it takes
[1:24:46] the complete five full ministry for me
[1:24:53] you know where I've stood for years I
[1:24:56] don't have meetings just to have
[1:24:57] meetings I don't have people just to
[1:24:59] have people come through it's a burden
[1:25:00] on my heart when I got presses upon my
[1:25:03] heart he knows what it's all about well
[1:25:05] brother Samuel they might get up and
[1:25:07] preach the same thing that you already
[1:25:08] preached that doesn't matter what
[1:25:10] matters is that our lives are touched
[1:25:13] and helped
[1:25:14] that's what matters needs are met god
[1:25:19] knows what he's doing he knows what he's
[1:25:21] doing you all okay I'm not gonna try to
[1:25:32] preach this all in one day there's many
[1:25:33] multiple things here and I don't have
[1:25:37] them all in front of me so I wouldn't do
[1:25:40] that
[1:25:41] but here we have highly resolve that
[1:25:44] these dead shall not have died in vain
[1:25:47] that this nation under God shall have a
[1:25:51] new birth of freedom think of these
[1:25:54] words that this nation would have a new
[1:25:57] birth of freedom how can you have a new
[1:26:00] birth of freedom you remember what he's
[1:26:01] doing he's going back to the original
[1:26:03] document what was the original document
[1:26:07] why why was it that we fled other less
[1:26:10] listen to me now
[1:26:11] you see these things are not spoke of in
[1:26:14] secular world but why was this even that
[1:26:21] of the of the pilgrims there's many of
[1:26:23] those things right there people just
[1:26:24] think oh they got on a boat and they
[1:26:26] came over you know from England and it
[1:26:28] was there it was the oppressiveness you
[1:26:30] know what they were fleeing here for it
[1:26:32] wasn't for a better land they came here
[1:26:34] for religious freedom then the land they
[1:26:41] didn't know what it held as a matter of
[1:26:43] fact they knew each time the thing that
[1:26:46] history does not depict in schools is
[1:26:49] how that they themselves even would have
[1:26:52] to go into other countries and how
[1:26:54] multiple times they were caught before
[1:26:57] ever making it here but the Prophet you
[1:27:01] know 1965 invisible Union he brought our
[1:27:07] attention back to this they landed our
[1:27:09] forefathers landed on Plymouth Rock they
[1:27:14] landed for that freedom of worship you
[1:27:16] see listen
[1:27:18] spirit that Antichrist spirit has been
[1:27:21] chasing after that dragon that spoke of
[1:27:24] in the Book of Revelations joke a joke
[1:27:27] writes of it and so does David calling
[1:27:29] it xi and it writes of those things all
[1:27:31] the way down through joggle speak up and
[1:27:34] metaphorically it's the same demon
[1:27:37] spirit that even try to swallow up the
[1:27:40] very birth of Jesus Christ but God's
[1:27:48] program cannot be defeated it will not
[1:27:53] be defeated because God can't be
[1:27:58] defeated God's program is God in flesh
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:09] and we can rights this a new birth of
[1:28:13] freedom ho ho there's nothing like real
[1:28:16] freedom outside of a real new birth in
[1:28:19] Jesus Christ you can join the church and
[1:28:23] you're still not free but a real new
[1:28:27] birth how do I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:28:33] there's a document and there's
[1:28:37] inspiration that's poured out repent and
[1:28:42] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:45] for the remission of sins he who
[1:28:50] fulfilled the Old Testament releases the
[1:28:54] life of the New Testament that ties us
[1:28:57] into the book and you shall receive the
[1:29:04] gift of the Holy Ghost that's what the
[1:29:08] document says I just tryin to look at it
[1:29:14] here a real short a little two to the
[1:29:17] two and a half minute speech but where
[1:29:20] it was coming from this he was not just
[1:29:22] speaking on deriving figures from
[1:29:24] antiquity and comparing this and
[1:29:25] comparing this he let it be known what
[1:29:27] has taken place but this there's a new
[1:29:30] birth of freedom
[1:29:32] hallelujah and that government listen is
[1:29:35] now and that government of the people by
[1:29:38] the people for the people shall not
[1:29:40] perish from the earth
[1:29:42] now I find it interesting that there are
[1:29:47] five copies of the Gettysburg Address
[1:29:50] and not one of the original copies is
[1:29:53] there in Gettysburg they're in different
[1:29:59] places library Library of Congress and
[1:30:01] this is where drawing a thought on
[1:30:03] preserved is striking is that they have
[1:30:07] taken of the original document in the
[1:30:11] Library of Congress they have so studied
[1:30:15] the case the materials because this
[1:30:21] document they want it to be preserved
[1:30:24] they don't want no oxidation no
[1:30:27] discoloring they're interesting in
[1:30:30] preserving the document so much that
[1:30:33] they look at the materials the variants
[1:30:36] of gasses that are in there and so
[1:30:38] they'll they remove the oxygen and they
[1:30:42] leave this container this glass so the
[1:30:45] people can look in there and they can
[1:30:47] look at the Gettysburg Address they can
[1:30:49] see it and they say oh it's been
[1:30:51] preserved but I ask you is that how its
[1:30:56] preserved is that how it's preserved
[1:31:03] because
[1:31:08] the document itself like our Bible or we
[1:31:16] can bring it our message it can be
[1:31:19] preserved by glass oxidation and yet it
[1:31:31] yet it's not preserved because unless
[1:31:36] this is written on the heart it's not
[1:31:42] preserved do you realize when you have
[1:31:46] been born again of the Spirit of God
[1:31:48] listen to me now they could come in here
[1:31:50] and demand every one of our Bibles they
[1:31:52] could demand you turn over your phones
[1:31:54] your tablet's turn over every one of
[1:31:56] your books and your tapes but you know
[1:31:58] what the word has already been wrote on
[1:32:00] your heart don't get me wrong I don't
[1:32:06] have to have this nor do I have to read
[1:32:09] the message or listen to it to be able
[1:32:11] to live an overcoming life but I do need
[1:32:14] it because it is the light of the hour
[1:32:16] and God has inspired it just as those
[1:32:19] who did not have the Bible Abraham job
[1:32:23] the rest but they knew it by revelation
[1:32:26] and the Prophet said that's the
[1:32:28] important thing
[1:32:31] you with me I'll tell you this right
[1:32:36] here there's times when over the years
[1:32:38] you've heard me say it over the years
[1:32:39] even before it that faster I get on
[1:32:42] something in order the Lord inspires I
[1:32:44] listen to a message I don't know how a
[1:32:46] little over and over a whole ream of
[1:32:47] message I just keep listening to a
[1:32:49] listener listen to him listen to him
[1:32:50] listen to mr. it might go on for months
[1:32:52] you say why because what I know it's not
[1:32:55] by my my intellect catching everything I
[1:32:58] wait on the Holy Spirit to inspire these
[1:33:00] things and the one thing about and when
[1:33:03] I look at it I you know for me I may be
[1:33:05] simple and I know I am but I take things
[1:33:07] and I hear how the Prophet he'll say
[1:33:09] certain things in the scriptures he
[1:33:11] referred to that I know that is not the
[1:33:14] mind of a man it gives light upon this
[1:33:17] way
[1:33:18] like I referred to you last week here he
[1:33:20] is standing in the message let your
[1:33:22] light so shine before men and he says
[1:33:24] this scripture says except you become as
[1:33:27] a little child he said see what that
[1:33:29] means is is to forgive like a child
[1:33:34] there's an offense come and a child
[1:33:37] they're back playing together again I
[1:33:39] said oh god help me help us help us
[1:33:43] Jesus you see you say well specimen that
[1:33:45] word it it deals with my heart that's
[1:33:47] what you want you want a water that
[1:33:50] deals with your heart I don't know how
[1:33:54] many times I'm standing in the yard
[1:33:56] repenting driving the clock repent come
[1:34:00] on somebody because the wire is dealing
[1:34:03] and it's moving in my life but let me
[1:34:05] tell you something thank God there is
[1:34:07] something that brings you and I to a
[1:34:09] reality that we can look at us at home
[1:34:12] what is it he's breaking amnesia away
[1:34:16] from our lives who else could do that
[1:34:20] but the Living God he's got a channel
[1:34:23] and he has visited us or glory if it's
[1:34:32] not preserved in the hearts of the
[1:34:34] people that all we have is a historical
[1:34:38] document a memorial of a historical
[1:34:44] speech given at a historical event by a
[1:34:50] historical figure or president whereby
[1:34:54] we have no connection nor true
[1:34:58] understanding of its meaning to us or
[1:35:01] our lives in other words we don't know
[1:35:04] who we are
[1:35:09] never was a time think of this time
[1:35:13] right here
[1:35:14] you know Scofield refers Scofield refers
[1:35:19] the term that Scofield uses for
[1:35:21] tribulation is anarchy and then
[1:35:25] incredible think of what we're living in
[1:35:27] this time I'd venture to say that our
[1:35:35] country has probably never been more
[1:35:37] divided than any I'm not here on a
[1:35:41] political stump speech I'm bringing this
[1:35:43] into the scriptures to show you these
[1:35:45] things are identified with this you
[1:35:50] don't know who you are and this our
[1:35:51] people it's an absolute I think of it
[1:35:54] like this it would be hard for us to get
[1:35:56] people to go fight in the army to go
[1:36:00] fight for the United States of America
[1:36:02] you know why people so despise being an
[1:36:05] American now I can't speak for them out
[1:36:08] there but I can refer you to how well
[1:36:13] it's again coming back to the character
[1:36:14] the Prophet could stand and say here in
[1:36:18] many places he says she's rotten to her
[1:36:21] core she's had the word ministered to
[1:36:28] her she had a time to accept it and in
[1:36:32] 1956 she turned it down you look on your
[1:36:36] computers Google it up look at the
[1:36:39] effects of things after in 1956 look at
[1:36:41] divorce rates look at all these things
[1:36:43] you say well what does that have to do
[1:36:45] with it it has everything to do with it
[1:36:48] you cannot walk away from God and remain
[1:36:52] the same but this is the things that
[1:37:01] happen but the brown refers to where
[1:37:04] when men would come with the ministering
[1:37:07] of the word I'm going to come down here
[1:37:09] the ministering of the word and after a
[1:37:13] messenger would go forth
[1:37:17] he said he'd start seeing things where
[1:37:21] people's lives he said they would come
[1:37:24] to church to have a great emotional time
[1:37:29] but he says when they leave are they
[1:37:32] living in it and walking to walk in it
[1:37:39] means that your life
[1:37:42] our lives are regulated by it that this
[1:37:48] is an absolute in our lives it's an
[1:37:57] absolute but it says no doubt when John
[1:38:01] was writing these things in first John
[1:38:04] John seen these things and he says what
[1:38:09] happens he says he says it like like
[1:38:12] this to where but that Antichrist spirit
[1:38:14] comes in and it comes in under cover it
[1:38:21] comes in a reason and human
[1:38:24] understanding and he says he's calling
[1:38:29] the people get back to Pentecost the
[1:38:31] real true experience but as usual
[1:38:33] there's an if he's in church you know
[1:38:36] some of you familiar with this you as
[1:38:38] usual people don't heed God's warning
[1:38:42] for someone not to heed God's warning
[1:38:45] they have to have some sort of a
[1:38:47] security or at least a sense of security
[1:38:50] to not heat it I'll tell you in this
[1:38:54] ours we said moments ago we want the
[1:38:56] word to deal with the hearts there is no
[1:39:01] security outside of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:04] Christ this is our place of refuge in
[1:39:08] him and this high priest he ever liveth
[1:39:14] we ain't never going out of this city a
[1:39:17] matter of fact we're gonna be raptured
[1:39:19] in this astronaut our high priest the
[1:39:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:25] he paid the price that revival fire
[1:39:31] notice he says it's built upon the
[1:39:33] sacred word so wonderful look at this
[1:39:35] it's built upon the sacred word so
[1:39:38] wonderful and the manifestation of the
[1:39:40] spirits so blessed that a little fear
[1:39:45] creeps in and a whisper in the heart
[1:39:49] says how can we protect this truth we
[1:39:54] have what can we do to see this revival
[1:40:00] goes on but you see when God sends the
[1:40:10] messenger he sends the messenger and he
[1:40:15] sends the message and he has children on
[1:40:20] earth that he has already equipped with
[1:40:25] the ability to hear and he is the one
[1:40:28] who plants the word in our hearts he is
[1:40:32] the one who calls us to himself he is
[1:40:35] the one who fulfills the word that is
[1:40:38] spoken and brings it into manifestation
[1:40:42] in our lives it is him no flesh can
[1:40:48] glory in his presence and brother
[1:40:54] Branham laid that so clear and at dinner
[1:40:56] bed with Jesus Christ in 1964 he said
[1:40:59] people have had the wrong slant on
[1:41:01] prophets they think it is the prophets
[1:41:04] doing that he said it was not the
[1:41:06] prophets it was God in the prophets he
[1:41:10] said their flesh cannot glory no more
[1:41:13] than the flesh of Jesus Christ can glory
[1:41:16] for Jesus himself said the side can do
[1:41:20] nothing of himself but what he sees the
[1:41:26] father doing see it shows there has to
[1:41:28] be eyes a channel a vision that's all
[1:41:30] pan that you can see what the father is
[1:41:33] doing the father was doing something he
[1:41:36] was doing a mark
[1:41:38] ass work in their day and yet the
[1:41:40] Pharisees looked at it and said you're
[1:41:42] Beelzebub are we talking about the same
[1:41:47] document oh yeah
[1:41:49] we're talk about the same document
[1:41:50] really Jesus stood there before him What
[1:41:55] did he say in John 5 he said I'm not the
[1:41:58] one who's accusing you
[1:42:01] Moses is accusing you they were faithful
[1:42:06] followers of Moses listen to me now
[1:42:08] I'm not gonna dwell on this point they
[1:42:10] were so faithful that even among
[1:42:12] themselves they had their own sex SCCT
[1:42:16] divisions are you with me I'm not just
[1:42:21] Pharisees and Sadducees I'm talking
[1:42:22] about even among the Pharisees see
[1:42:26] there's nothing can unify outside of the
[1:42:28] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:42:30] and that is what our focus is to be upon
[1:42:35] I'll say it very clearly there's gonna
[1:42:38] be things until God - we're raptured out
[1:42:40] here they're gonna be little ideas
[1:42:41] things you might feel a certain way a
[1:42:43] certain brother feels a certain way or
[1:42:44] this or that or one or more you know
[1:42:45] what it's it's in God's hands just as
[1:42:48] much as I'm trusting God if there's
[1:42:50] wrinkles in me to iron them out God
[1:42:51] we're in that I'm not responsible Oh I'm
[1:42:54] responsible for is to give myself to God
[1:42:56] like you are I said it before if I have
[1:43:02] an idea that where I'm going to preach
[1:43:04] there might possibly this might disturb
[1:43:06] somebody I will wear white and I'll wear
[1:43:10] it with all humility because you know
[1:43:11] why I don't care I don't care if I've
[1:43:14] got to wear polka dots
[1:43:15] I just want to serve his people if it
[1:43:21] bothers people that I wear a suit than
[1:43:23] it has a vest although saying I wouldn't
[1:43:26] know I'm not interested in that I don't
[1:43:28] want to hinder the word from reaching
[1:43:30] its mark that's a whole separate thought
[1:43:34] that's also part of being preserved
[1:43:37] I'm thankful God's dealing with our
[1:43:39] lives aren't you
[1:43:40] I'm thankful he brings these things
[1:43:42] really to the forefront of what the
[1:43:44] focus is
[1:43:49] hmmm that little fear comes in how do we
[1:43:53] keep this how do we preserve this
[1:43:55] because back to this point that though
[1:43:59] we could preserve all of these words and
[1:44:03] I think God hey I thank God for the
[1:44:06] battles it's been fun I think God for
[1:44:10] the laboring of all the brothers where
[1:44:13] they've transcribed and so forth the
[1:44:15] message I think God for their I think
[1:44:17] God that I've got on my phone I think
[1:44:21] God for them I know it was a brother
[1:44:23] that did that and I think that brother
[1:44:25] for doing that and dedicating all those
[1:44:27] things and just doing it he didn't even
[1:44:29] ask for money he just dedicated it I
[1:44:30] think God for that I look at those
[1:44:34] little things you know what I look at
[1:44:36] these are not just it we will give an
[1:44:38] account for it but I look at it what
[1:44:41] things have been provided to us what
[1:44:43] tools what different things let me move
[1:44:46] to this I'm gonna we're close and we'll
[1:44:48] pick it up here so the font how do we
[1:44:57] preserve
[1:45:02] well it's God who sent it it's God who
[1:45:08] watches over it it's God who keep it now
[1:45:13] very clear as the Prophet would would
[1:45:18] bring this in these places of how that
[1:45:21] you would have let me just skip this
[1:45:24] come down into this place my if I can
[1:45:32] get there
[1:45:36] you are still okay I'm getting there and
[1:45:41] just to think I didn't include
[1:45:42] everything
[1:45:50] in The Book of Revelations chapter 5 it
[1:45:53] speaks that there is a lamb and it the
[1:46:00] book of Revelation is filled with
[1:46:01] symbols just give me your attention for
[1:46:05] about five more minutes these symbols
[1:46:08] are symbols that are only interpreted by
[1:46:16] an angel
[1:46:16] revelations one an angel lowercase he is
[1:46:20] sent to John notice this messenger was
[1:46:24] not even though it's to all but had come
[1:46:27] with a specific one in mind to declare
[1:46:32] to John those things which must shortly
[1:46:34] come to pass seeing God's time for you
[1:46:39] and I have 2000 years but in God's time
[1:46:44] but how do we preserve that the Bible
[1:46:48] speaks of the lamb and the lamb having
[1:46:50] seven horns and it speaks in this manner
[1:46:54] here's the lamb lamb a type that of the
[1:46:58] Lord Jesus Christ our Passover lamb that
[1:47:01] perfect sacrifice he not that is offered
[1:47:04] up now but remember the time that we're
[1:47:06] living in it points back to the true
[1:47:10] atonement the Lamb that has already been
[1:47:12] offered you with me in Leviticus 23 I
[1:47:15] know some will be some won't be but what
[1:47:17] I'm saying is that now is is not an
[1:47:20] introducing of a new gospel it is
[1:47:22] declaring the true atonement the true
[1:47:25] Passover lamb the true token that was
[1:47:28] offered back there in redemptive work
[1:47:30] and it unveils all of these things all
[1:47:32] the way on down and the Prophet picks
[1:47:38] picks this out and he says those seven
[1:47:40] horns is how the lamb protects his
[1:47:45] rights
[1:47:48] his rights he protects his rights the
[1:47:53] Prophet says it like this
[1:47:54] that's the lambs protection those horns
[1:47:58] what he protected his rights with on
[1:48:01] earth was a god-sent group of people
[1:48:03] that's protected so he's protecting his
[1:48:09] right how is he protecting his rights by
[1:48:13] a god-sent
[1:48:14] group of people not by having a document
[1:48:18] out here but by that being in here for
[1:48:25] as he said through Paul Paul said that
[1:48:28] the Gentiles which have not the law do
[1:48:33] by nature the things contained therein
[1:48:37] what a ministry that xcellent there was
[1:48:43] it written in stone on Mount Sonia but
[1:48:46] now God was letting it be known there he
[1:48:49] didn't come and write it in stone enough
[1:48:50] he wrote it in the heart of flesh he
[1:48:56] came and pressed his own image forth in
[1:48:59] our life and let me say this this
[1:49:02] preserving this preserving you realize
[1:49:05] listen to me now in closing you can come
[1:49:09] to this church you can come here under
[1:49:12] the canopy and presence of this message
[1:49:14] that is preached in this hour you can
[1:49:17] come under under all of that but
[1:49:20] remember the preserving of it it must be
[1:49:25] in your heart because if it's not in
[1:49:28] your heart there will be a trial there
[1:49:33] will be a test there will be an offense
[1:49:35] that will arrive there will be something
[1:49:39] that will arise that will take what you
[1:49:43] thought to be a new birth of freedom and
[1:49:46] it really not a new birth of freedom but
[1:49:50] a new birth of freedom is where the
[1:49:51] document oh it's not preserved in
[1:49:55] pressurised glass in Washington it's
[1:49:58] sealed in you by the
[1:50:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and people who
[1:50:05] won't even read the Bible and come and
[1:50:07] look at the document but yet the
[1:50:08] document is on display in you you are
[1:50:12] God's looking-glass
[1:50:16] Alleluia
[1:50:17] they're seeing this Liberty in your life
[1:50:24] what is this this is God's way of
[1:50:26] preserving his word because he said in
[1:50:31] the book of Jude will I find faith if it
[1:50:36] was up to me or you our strength
[1:50:39] no but it's him it is him that worketh
[1:50:46] to perform his away so he will find
[1:50:50] faith because it is not our faith it is
[1:50:54] his faith the life that I now live I now
[1:50:58] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[1:51:00] loved me and gave himself for me and he
[1:51:03] what he did he sent a messenger to me
[1:51:06] with a message specifically for me to
[1:51:09] let me know I was there included in the
[1:51:13] automa I was there in God's mind before
[1:51:17] the foundation the world where men have
[1:51:20] drifted from the document where men have
[1:51:22] despised it and they were going to bid
[1:51:25] on it for pity's but God came down in
[1:51:27] this hour and he picked up the
[1:51:29] constitution of his word and he put his
[1:51:32] hair and begins to take the ball and he
[1:51:35] began to play the symphony the divine
[1:51:43] orchestration what was looked at has
[1:51:46] just some other piece they were
[1:51:48] auctioning off pieces of it
[1:51:50] God don't move the same way y'all don't
[1:51:52] give the baptism of the Holy Ghost this
[1:51:54] is so much women dressed this way men
[1:51:56] all these are being auctioned off but
[1:51:59] God said I'll take that
[1:52:04] oh this is more than four score and
[1:52:07] seven years ago from eternity I loved
[1:52:16] you I had you in my mind my thoughts
[1:52:22] we're all about you you've always been
[1:52:26] the apple of my great songs I have even
[1:52:33] inspiration
[1:52:34] I've poured out your name has always
[1:52:37] been here and now my presence is here to
[1:52:41] remove doubt you are mine you are mine I
[1:52:47] have taken you to myself I preserved you
[1:52:53] as my workmanship and my word is sealed
[1:52:59] in your heart my rights of movement the
[1:53:03] flow of the Holy Spirit the gifts all of
[1:53:06] those things my rights I have protected
[1:53:12] in your heart I'd say Oh God Oh God
[1:53:23] my hands up to heaven in my heart let me
[1:53:28] give him her dying breath
[1:53:30] let me give everything I've got me lay
[1:53:35] aside lay aside differences give
[1:53:38] everything we've got for this final
[1:53:41] charge this lap this finish line give
[1:53:45] everything that we've got for this last
[1:53:48] moment this short quick word preserved
[1:53:53] in his presence a new birth of freedom
[1:53:57] a Liberty pardon me but I feel like
[1:54:03] general Armistead from there of Northern
[1:54:05] Virginia and he took his hat and rammed
[1:54:07] that sword up and he looked around at
[1:54:09] them boys they knew they were heading to
[1:54:12] their death but these words is what rung
[1:54:14] in my heart and I believe to be so
[1:54:16] fitting for our lives he said men think
[1:54:20] about your homes this day think about
[1:54:24] your sweethearts this day think about
[1:54:27] your children this day think about this
[1:54:30] and I say with all of my heart let us
[1:54:32] think about our families let us think
[1:54:34] about how God Himself has brought forth
[1:54:37] this word let us be focused on the
[1:54:40] rapture let us be focused on him
[1:54:49] with all my heart but the Brian would
[1:54:53] you come please sing that I pledge
[1:54:56] allegiance to the lamb if you haven't
