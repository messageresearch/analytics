[36:30] hallelujah amen that's our longing isn't
[36:34] it
[36:34] amen God has made an escape for us
[36:38] whether it be my death or by the rapture
[36:42] amen this is ours it's our escape out of
[36:46] this life but certainly we you know even
[36:48] as you see as those that is a growing
[36:52] older and we see you start sensing
[36:54] things even in your body you're thankful
[36:56] that God has made a way of escape for us
[37:01] a man that we we don't have to continue
[37:05] to tarry but we believe that all things
[37:08] that God has clearly pointed to us and
[37:11] we see in the scripture where we are
[37:12] standing we're standing in the place
[37:15] that all have looked and all the prayers
[37:26] everything all the way down through the
[37:28] ages have spoken of this time what a
[37:32] privilege and with this privilege comes
[37:36] such a great responsibility may God help
[37:39] us give us the grace to do what he's
[37:43] called us to do amen
[37:45] let's just stand we want to look right
[37:48] into the word of the Lord let's go to
[37:54] Genesis chapter 27 verse 41
[38:06] we want to read just a little bit more
[38:09] here the life of Jacob in verse 41 of
[38:18] Genesis 27 the scripture said and Esau
[38:23] hated Jacob because of the blessing
[38:27] wherewith his father blessed him and
[38:30] Esau said in his life the days of
[38:34] mourning for my father are at hand then
[38:36] will I slay my brother Jacob and these
[38:39] words of Esau her elder son were told to
[38:43] Rebekah and she sent and called Jacob
[38:46] her younger son and said unto Him behold
[38:49] thy brother Esau as touching thee doth
[38:52] comfort himself purposing to kill thee
[38:56] now therefore my son obey my voice
[39:00] arise and flee to Laban my brother to
[39:05] her honor and tarry with him a few days
[39:08] until thy brother's fury turn away until
[39:11] thy brother's anger turn away from thee
[39:14] and he will forget that which thou has
[39:17] done to him
[39:18] then I will send and fetch thee from
[39:21] thence why should I be deprived also of
[39:24] you both in one day and Rebekah said to
[39:27] Isaac I am weary of my life because of
[39:30] the daughters of Heth if Jacob take a
[39:33] wife of the daughters of Heth such as
[39:35] these which are the daughters of the
[39:38] land
[39:38] what good shall my life do me so there's
[39:45] going to be there is to be a fulfillment
[39:47] let's just look to the Lord in a word of
[39:49] Prayer our Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[39:55] are just so thankful tonight Lord to be
[39:57] able to come together Lord with brothers
[40:00] and sisters of like precious faith Lord
[40:03] seeing that you you know the need Lord
[40:05] within every heart and every life Lord
[40:08] if there be any question Lord or father
[40:11] Lord you are the answer Lord and you
[40:14] know how to speak Lord to every heart
[40:16] Lord and minister
[40:17] to every need Lord so we just Lord
[40:20] reserved ourselves and we just do it ask
[40:23] Lord that together that the Lord you
[40:25] would help us to get out of the way that
[40:27] you Lord the author Lord of the book
[40:29] Lord Father the Fox that you have sealed
[40:32] within here Lord God that you would
[40:34] comment just Minister to our hearts
[40:37] tonight in a very personal way Lord we
[40:40] pray we just commit ourselves to you
[40:42] Lord we give you praise and thanks Lord
[40:45] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[40:48] god bless you being seated if you just
[40:51] keep your Bibles open there with me if
[40:54] you would you see that how that in this
[40:58] this portion of Scripture we we've been
[41:01] dealing with the thought here for some
[41:03] time looking at how that the blessing
[41:08] itself and the blessing being that of
[41:11] the life of God that that belongs to the
[41:16] blessed and the blessed we recognize as
[41:21] that as we've seen in the Scriptures is
[41:24] God's choosing when Mary was approached
[41:28] by by the angel the angel spoke to her
[41:32] and said Mary thou art highly favoured
[41:36] thou art blessed among women it wasn't
[41:41] something that Mary we know that she had
[41:44] just done that she had obtained favor
[41:47] but her favored the favor is that favor
[41:51] which is unmerited it was given by the
[41:55] grace of God before the foundation of
[41:57] the world it was already he before
[42:00] Isaiah ever prophesied a virgin shall
[42:03] conceive this was already in God's mind
[42:05] so here she is moving into that time and
[42:08] if you think of how that the Prophet
[42:10] places it and he dramatizes it in Mary's
[42:14] belief and in the other messages to
[42:16] where that if the Spirit of God begins
[42:20] to move upon Mary's heart at that time
[42:22] pertaining to those scriptures in
[42:25] regards to a virgin shall conceive she
[42:29] begins to think of those scriptures
[42:31] to talk anuman she's talking with her
[42:34] and her and Joseph and remember how the
[42:37] Prophet would place it as though she is
[42:39] asking Joseph and Joseph says Mary
[42:41] that's a little too deep for me to
[42:43] explain how he said but this is one
[42:46] thing that we know Isaiah is God's
[42:49] prophet and we know that a prophet has
[42:52] the word of the Lord so we know that
[42:55] God's Word cannot fail and I think that
[42:59] was a very very tremendous dramatization
[43:04] and statement that is made there when we
[43:06] you can see how that within Mary already
[43:10] chosen and we would see the choosing of
[43:13] God I just want to refer it to a place
[43:15] that I referred to last week brother
[43:18] Bram says sometimes with the with the
[43:19] term predestination he said people get
[43:22] to thinking as though that it's gonna be
[43:24] God do all the pushing and God do all
[43:27] the pooling but yet the predestination
[43:30] of God does not remove and take away
[43:35] from decisions and choices that are to
[43:37] be made the thing that is true is that
[43:41] it's just like this within the
[43:43] predestination of God being chosen of
[43:45] God that God was sinful or that the
[43:48] influence of his word by his Spirit and
[43:51] will influence his children to make the
[43:55] decision in the hour that is crucial and
[43:57] needful when he is present there could
[44:01] be a lot of other decisions that they
[44:02] can make within their life that are
[44:05] decisions that you know can bring
[44:08] trouble and so forth but the ultimate
[44:11] decision that they are influenced there
[44:13] to make is that decision of life because
[44:16] they are ordained to life and it is God
[44:20] that seeks each and every one out it's
[44:22] just when we are looking at this here
[44:25] with Jacob and when you see this within
[44:27] Jacob's life here as we looked at it
[44:30] last week and I just feel pulled just in
[44:32] in some of these things just to go
[44:34] through them when you look at this
[44:36] within Jacob's life even though it is
[44:39] spoken to Rebekah the mystery of what's
[44:42] going on within her
[44:43] that the elder shall serve the younger
[44:46] this is made known to Rebecca Rebecca
[44:49] keeps this in her heart and then in the
[44:52] time when Rebecca hears that that it's
[44:56] time for the blessing to be pronounced
[44:59] she gives direction to Jacob at that
[45:02] time and you and you you look at it here
[45:06] Esau goes off but yet Jacob receives
[45:08] direction at that time and this is the
[45:11] thing that I know very simple but when
[45:13] you can see it how that even though that
[45:16] Jacob was ordained of God said that he
[45:20] would be the one to receive the
[45:22] birthright his birth was against him the
[45:27] order was against him and you can see
[45:30] that how that God Justin did not just
[45:32] leave things in a manner of a haphazard
[45:36] way and say well Jacob you know he's
[45:38] predestinated he'll get there but what
[45:41] God does when we look at just at this
[45:43] parallel we see how that God Himself
[45:46] provides what's needed for when his
[45:49] children are up on earth and God is
[45:53] there to care to shepherd to guide and
[45:56] to bring us to that place that he's
[46:00] ordained for us so we see that not only
[46:03] in the spiritual birth we see it also
[46:06] how that God has appointed those things
[46:08] around us but to recognize that even in
[46:11] that that how that God has saw deigned
[46:14] it to bring us from our spiritual birth
[46:17] into that translation of the body so
[46:20] it's God that has provided it's him even
[46:23] God that is moving through his ministry
[46:26] it's God that's doing the work
[46:29] it's God that's laying that the the
[46:31] message is upon the servants heart it's
[46:33] God that is bringing direction it's God
[46:36] that's bringing counsel and we want to
[46:38] be sensitive to hear what God has to say
[46:41] to our hearts because it's God this is
[46:45] the thing it's God caring and watching
[46:47] over his word and we believe we believe
[46:51] I'm a part of that word so it's God
[46:54] watching over it it's God that even
[46:56] though
[46:57] we know it must be that faith move
[46:59] within our hearts but it's God himself
[47:01] that moves to stimulate our faith by his
[47:06] word has his presence comes to confirm
[47:08] it it's God coming and he's the one that
[47:11] stirs it up and then here we stand and
[47:13] say yes Lord that's me and it's all him
[47:16] providing for himself there's no glory
[47:20] that we can take within any of it but
[47:24] yet that doesn't mean that then we don't
[47:25] have to do anything when it comes down
[47:27] to is him moving upon our lives and
[47:30] within us were yielding so when we're
[47:35] looking at all of this we see that even
[47:37] with Jacob all Jacob had to do was yield
[47:41] to what was being spoken even things
[47:43] that didn't make sense things that also
[47:45] that was troubling to him that would
[47:47] bring that you could see the fear what
[47:50] if my father what if he discovers it's
[47:52] me but yet Rebekah assures him she's
[47:55] she's taking full responsibility for him
[47:58] thy curse be upon me then you think of
[48:02] how that in word when Jacob stands there
[48:04] before I and Isaac says how is it my son
[48:09] that thou has found this so quickly and
[48:12] notice what Jacob he has received of
[48:15] God's grace for that moment he says the
[48:18] Lord thy God had brought it to me he's
[48:21] recognizing that it's the Lord that has
[48:24] ordered him on even what to go and get
[48:26] and then to bring that to his mother his
[48:29] mother makes preparation that he might
[48:31] take it into his father that he might
[48:33] receive the blessing pronounced over his
[48:35] life it's God providing for himself I
[48:39] know this I know that it's very simple
[48:41] and there's things that you know I
[48:43] thought man I just want to move on a
[48:45] little bit but I just also want to be
[48:47] able to be led by the Lord and that
[48:49] every little thing that we can take out
[48:51] of here that God has for us we want to
[48:54] take out of here because God knows what
[48:56] we need and so you find that with that
[48:58] in mind look at how Rebekah look at how
[49:01] that Rebecca's moved in this time she
[49:04] she hears of what he saw has said and
[49:06] she hears this
[49:08] her.she she calls jacob and she begins
[49:11] to let Jacob know that Jacob there if I
[49:14] can say it in this terms there's a
[49:15] bounty upon your head Esau is upset with
[49:19] you because the blessing that you have
[49:22] obtained and yet when you look at it
[49:24] it's not the the actuality of what the
[49:28] real blessing was that Esau wanted Esau
[49:32] only wanted if we can say the benefits
[49:35] or the overflow or those things about it
[49:38] he was not after the life because when
[49:43] he comes to to Jacob when he comes like
[49:45] Isaac he said father haven't you at
[49:47] least got one blessing left for me he's
[49:50] not after he's never had a value for the
[49:53] birthright that he had in his possession
[49:55] it was in his possession nobody took it
[49:59] from him I hope you understanding me
[50:02] nobody took it from him he was in his
[50:05] possession he had it right in front of
[50:07] him but he allowed it to pass from him
[50:12] he allowed it nobody took it from him he
[50:16] permitted it so when you see how that
[50:20] Rebekah taking this burden upon her and
[50:23] I just very very much so he can see how
[50:26] that it's God that is placed the burden
[50:29] on Rebecca's heart where for her even as
[50:31] she says here at the very end of it when
[50:34] she speaks in verse 46 there to Isaac
[50:37] and she says I'm weary of my life
[50:39] because of the daughters of health if
[50:41] Jacob take a wife of the daughters of
[50:43] Heth such as these which are the
[50:44] daughters of the land
[50:45] what good shall my life do me everything
[50:49] all that she's prayed for all of the the
[50:52] direction and everything was she was
[50:54] obedient to what God had spoke to her
[50:57] regarding those twins there within her
[51:00] womb and how that even she's moved in
[51:03] that hour to give direction unto Jacob
[51:06] at that time by the leadership of the
[51:07] Holy Spirit but yet even in this time
[51:09] she says he cannot take a daughter of
[51:12] that - wife of the daughters of Heth
[51:14] it's got to be one of kin one from the
[51:19] homeland that's a bird
[51:21] that is there that's resonating in her
[51:24] heart that it's not it's not just
[51:25] something that here he's obtained the
[51:28] pronouncement of the blessing but there
[51:29] has got to be a completion of this Jacob
[51:32] himself has there has to be a union
[51:34] there has to be a bride there has to be
[51:36] one that he takes for his very own so
[51:42] notice this in verse one of Genesis 28
[51:46] the scripture said that Isaac called
[51:49] Jacob and blessed him and charged him
[51:54] and said unto Him thou shalt not take a
[51:57] wife of the daughters of Canaan arise
[52:00] and go to and I run to the house of Beth
[52:04] you'll die mother's father and take thee
[52:06] a wife from thence of the daughters of
[52:08] Laban thy mother's brother and god
[52:11] almighty bless thee and make thee
[52:14] fruitful and multiply thee that thou
[52:17] mayst be a multitude of people and give
[52:20] the blessing of Abraham to thee and to
[52:22] thy seed with thee that thou mayst
[52:25] inherit the land wherein thou art a
[52:28] stranger which God gave unto Abraham now
[52:32] notice I'll this time together here that
[52:35] the blessing of Abraham this is God's
[52:38] covenant this is God's life and this is
[52:42] solemnly God who gives this that with
[52:45] this blessing of Abraham thou mayest
[52:47] inherit the land wherein thou art a
[52:50] stranger which God gave unto Abram and
[52:52] Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to
[52:55] panorama unto Laban son of bethuel the
[52:59] Syrian the brother of Rebekah Jacobs and
[53:02] Esau mother now let's look here just for
[53:05] a moment on this blessing of Abraham
[53:07] because as the scripture mentions here
[53:09] that God Almighty give me the blessing
[53:11] of Abraham in the book of Galatians
[53:13] chapter 3 verse 13 the scripture says
[53:16] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[53:18] of the law being made a curse for us for
[53:21] it is written cursed is every one that
[53:23] hangeth on a tree that the blessing of
[53:26] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[53:28] through Jesus Christ that we might
[53:31] receive the promise of the Spirit
[53:33] through
[53:34] brethren I speak after the manner of men
[53:36] though it be but a man's covenant yet if
[53:39] it be confirmed no man dissing Allah or
[53:41] out of there - now to Abraham and his
[53:44] seed where the promise is made and he
[53:46] saith not and to seeds as a minute but
[53:48] as of one and to thy seed which is
[53:50] Christ as watch how the Prophet takes
[53:54] this here in the revelation of Jesus
[53:56] Christ
[53:57] he says notice another glorious
[53:59] revelation in this typing of Joseph
[54:01] Joseph while in Egypt was given a
[54:03] Gentile bride and through her he
[54:05] received a family of two sons ephraim
[54:08] and manasseh joseph asked his father to
[54:10] bless the two boys he placed them in
[54:13] front of jacob so that Manasseh the
[54:15] firstborn would be on jacob's right and
[54:17] ephraim to the left as jacob was about
[54:20] to bless them he crossed his hands so
[54:22] that the right hand fell upon the
[54:24] younger and joseph cried out not so
[54:27] father this is the firstborn to your
[54:30] right
[54:30] but Jacob said God crossed my hands here
[54:34] in tight we see that the blessing which
[54:37] belonged to the firstborn the Jew was
[54:40] given over to the younger the Gentile
[54:42] through the cross crossed hands of the
[54:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[54:46] remember Apostle Paul picks this up in
[54:49] Romans 8 that unto Israel unto the Jew
[54:52] whom pertaineth the adoption who
[54:54] pertained at the covenants all of those
[54:56] things were pertaining unto them but
[54:58] because of the rejection now through
[55:01] Calvary the offering up of the sacrifice
[55:04] where it should have went to the Jew
[55:07] instead through the cross it passes on
[55:10] the younger which is the Gentile whoa
[55:14] hallelujah amen you and I you and I
[55:17] Jacob didn't know remember here's Jacob
[55:20] he crosses as he does not realize he
[55:24] doesn't see it all of what's taking
[55:26] place but God is sovereign Lee moving
[55:28] look at this this action upon earth was
[55:32] already in God's mind
[55:35] you and I were held there in that action
[55:39] when he crossed those hands that was God
[55:41] saying I already thought of you hey men
[55:46] that wasn't you and I identified there
[55:48] in that scripture we can look at that
[55:51] scripture and see the grace and the
[55:53] mercy of God to us the blessing he goes
[55:58] on to say the blessing comes through the
[56:02] cross and he reads the scriptures that I
[56:04] just read there at the very end of that
[56:07] paragraph he says the blessing of
[56:09] Abraham came through the cross to the
[56:11] Gentiles the Jews rejected the cross
[56:13] therefore Jesus got the Gentile bride so
[56:18] when we we recognize that the birthright
[56:21] is the right of the firstborn and think
[56:27] back into the scripture wind as we said
[56:30] moments ago that Jacob recognizes that
[56:33] his day of departure is close at hand so
[56:38] when Jacob realizes that his day of
[56:40] departure is close at hand he he sends
[56:44] forth Esau and he tells he sought what
[56:48] to go and get that he might come that I
[56:50] might bless thee so when we're looking
[56:53] at that blessing of the blessing that
[56:57] pertain it's there to the birthright
[56:59] here Jacob it's it's known this is the
[57:03] time this is the moment and as he guess
[57:07] he moves with within this what is taking
[57:11] place in this time is the pronouncing of
[57:14] the blessing it's not the actual
[57:18] imparting of the blessing at that time
[57:22] it is the pronouncing of that because
[57:25] Jacob here he is under the pronouncement
[57:28] you know Jacob still walks out Jacob I
[57:32] want you just to watch this here so you
[57:36] find that how it could not be this
[57:38] blessing you could not be something that
[57:40] would be pronounced after Jacob had
[57:43] passed off the scene or after ice that
[57:45] could pass off the scene and then we
[57:48] find even how Abe
[57:49] you know had passed it on to Isaac but
[57:51] it was not just something that was just
[57:52] handed down there was an appointed time
[57:55] where that that blessing of the of the
[57:59] birthright was pronounced upon that of
[58:02] the firstborn it was a very crucial time
[58:06] that's why Rebecca moved with the Ernest
[58:08] T of which she did you think of how that
[58:10] the Lord Jesus now I want you to think
[58:12] of this here how that the Lord Jesus
[58:14] himself when he made promise and we're
[58:17] thinking of this blessing of Abraham
[58:19] that his spoke there in the scripture
[58:21] this blessing of Abraham here the Lord
[58:23] Jesus declares to the Church of the
[58:25] Living God and he says these things have
[58:28] I spoken unto you being yet present with
[58:30] you but the comforter which is the Holy
[58:32] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[58:35] name he shall teach you all things and
[58:38] bring all things to your remembrance
[58:39] whatsoever I have said unto you so he
[58:43] sends the Holy Ghost is sent in his name
[58:46] note there is a purpose within this and
[58:49] remember as the Scriptures declare his
[58:52] name in the Book of Revelations is
[58:53] called the Word of God
[58:55] so his name being revealed it's his
[58:58] person being revealed it's his
[59:00] characteristics being revealed it's him
[59:02] being revealed so he sends the father's
[59:06] sins the Holy Ghost which is the
[59:09] blessing of Abraham he sends it in his
[59:12] name now what's this here Jesus when
[59:16] he's here in John 5:39 among many places
[59:19] in the scriptures but he speaks to the
[59:21] people in that hour
[59:22] search the scriptures now who's he
[59:24] speaking to those to whom the birthright
[59:27] would belong are you with me he's
[59:30] speaking to them now search the
[59:32] Scriptures for in them you think you
[59:34] have eternal life and they are they
[59:36] which testify of me and you will not
[59:39] come to me that you might have life they
[59:45] had right to the birthright but here
[59:48] stay in the midst of the time when life
[59:51] is standing before them they reject they
[59:54] despise they turn it down turn it down
[59:57] for what they don't turn it down for
[59:58] going out into the world they turn it
[1:00:00] down for
[1:00:01] creeds they turn it down for dogmas they
[1:00:04] turn it down they sell out in order to
[1:00:07] maintain where they're at and what
[1:00:09] happens the birthright passes on they're
[1:00:14] left in darkness that's why Jesus said
[1:00:16] walk in the light while you have the
[1:00:18] light what is like for that you can see
[1:00:20] where you're going is to show the
[1:00:22] pathway walk in the light while you have
[1:00:24] the light lest darkness overtake you so
[1:00:29] then here as you see that when here they
[1:00:33] they they they they crucified him and
[1:00:36] when they crucified him remember they
[1:00:39] put him out and they could go on they
[1:00:42] went on but yet God moved on and here
[1:00:45] was an electro-pop people even when he
[1:00:48] was here upon the earth it was a small
[1:00:50] little group of people that was
[1:00:52] identified and was catching the
[1:00:55] revelation of that time and they it
[1:00:57] wasn't the intellectual people of the
[1:01:00] hour but it was the very much so those
[1:01:02] that were off scour even how the Prophet
[1:01:05] could say their name can be rode on the
[1:01:07] side of a boxcar and they couldn't even
[1:01:08] read it
[1:01:09] it wasn't the purporting of ignorance
[1:01:12] but what it was showing is is that God's
[1:01:14] foreign nation and God's choosing when
[1:01:17] that word would pass across the pathway
[1:01:19] it would have some meaning and have an
[1:01:22] effect upon their life it's God moving
[1:01:27] by way of his word so has he moves for
[1:01:31] the Mint's now remember you find this
[1:01:33] even where Paul remember how it's Paul
[1:01:35] standing here I believe you know it's I
[1:01:37] believe it's acts 10 where Paul is
[1:01:39] standing it's X 10 or X 9 where Paul is
[1:01:41] standing and he's speaking there to the
[1:01:43] Jews remember how Paul who's growing
[1:01:45] there among the Jews and the Jews you
[1:01:47] know they were rising up and they were
[1:01:49] stoning Paul for speaking blasphemy
[1:01:51] Essenes they were they were charging him
[1:01:53] with those things and remember what the
[1:01:55] Spirit of God spoke through Paul and it
[1:01:58] says because you judge yourself unworthy
[1:02:00] love we turned to the Gentiles
[1:02:04] God had given even a space of grace
[1:02:07] right there that they might receive and
[1:02:10] come under
[1:02:11] that blessing of the birthright and
[1:02:13] fully obtained it but because they
[1:02:16] rejected it now the word moves on and
[1:02:19] there is nothing prescient that can
[1:02:23] bring the best thing of Abraham on their
[1:02:25] life no matter how much they can read
[1:02:27] there's nothing prescient that can bring
[1:02:30] the blessing of Abraham I'll say like
[1:02:32] this so clearly there's nothing present
[1:02:35] that can bring the real truth birth of
[1:02:38] the Holy Ghost outside of the word of
[1:02:41] Almighty God when the world is spurned
[1:02:43] when the world is rejected they're
[1:02:45] rejecting life they're turning it out
[1:02:48] it's that himself which is able to stand
[1:02:51] and pronounce the blessing and then we
[1:02:53] come under that blessing
[1:02:56] hallelujah notice how it says in the
[1:03:01] revelations behold I stand at the door
[1:03:05] and knock
[1:03:08] he's put out they don't want they don't
[1:03:13] want the life giver there they don't
[1:03:15] want the word there they don't want that
[1:03:17] at all
[1:03:18] they put it out from him who did they
[1:03:20] put out they put Christ listen this is
[1:03:22] not a doctrine he said behold I stand at
[1:03:26] the door this is not a teaching this is
[1:03:29] the person of Jesus Christ amen this is
[1:03:33] the fountain of life himself this is the
[1:03:35] blessed sir and they have put him out of
[1:03:38] the church and yet have more Bibles than
[1:03:41] anything else everything and and
[1:03:43] everything populated but they put him
[1:03:46] out of the church he is not allowed to
[1:03:48] have the right away so what are you left
[1:03:53] with
[1:03:53] you're left with a lot of pronouncing x'
[1:03:56] but it is not the true witness of the
[1:03:59] holy ghost
[1:04:00] it's pronouncing things that's to be the
[1:04:02] birthright but it never turns into a
[1:04:05] genuine birth why Jacob said the time of
[1:04:11] my departure is at hand it's a crucial
[1:04:14] time it's a crucial time there's always
[1:04:18] a measure of time God gives a space of
[1:04:21] time through every age God gives a space
[1:04:24] of time notice this how that dick of
[1:04:29] these statements here brother branham
[1:04:30] makes in modern events make clear about
[1:04:34] prophecy is that how it can tell this
[1:04:37] lady OC in church age the good thing how
[1:04:39] can I do it when the good things when
[1:04:41] God spoke against it you're naked
[1:04:43] miserable you say I'm rich
[1:04:45] I have better I have churches like the
[1:04:47] Methodists and the Baptist's and the
[1:04:48] Presbyterians I have this I have that
[1:04:50] the best this that and the other that's
[1:04:52] right but you don't know you're naked
[1:04:54] blind miserable to the real thing that
[1:04:57] God is manifesting it'll go right
[1:05:01] through you like that moving right out
[1:05:03] believe people before it's too late
[1:05:07] what's he calling the attention to the
[1:05:10] blessing the breath ride is being
[1:05:13] pronounced here's a time to be born of
[1:05:18] the Spirit of God his account can come
[1:05:20] when the word is present you understand
[1:05:25] what I'm saying people can live friends
[1:05:28] listen to me I want you to see this
[1:05:30] people can live real sanctified life but
[1:05:33] a sanctified life does not mean it's a
[1:05:35] Holy Ghost filled life the saint of that
[1:05:37] life can live our last cleaned up life
[1:05:39] there are foolish virgins but they're
[1:05:42] not filled with oil they don't have the
[1:05:47] Holy Spirit in their life but don't have
[1:05:49] the Holy Ghost they're veterans clean
[1:05:52] living people my friends listen it ain't
[1:05:55] enough just to have a sanctified life
[1:05:58] it's God has gotta be loyal in their
[1:06:00] life there's gotta be a fire that's lit
[1:06:03] that conserves that Jesus Christ is
[1:06:06] alive and well that confirms that indeed
[1:06:09] he is Lord amen
[1:06:14] her life must give that testimony that's
[1:06:21] why even in the fourth personage of him
[1:06:24] in the Book of Revelations the voice of
[1:06:26] many waters crying out the Spirit of God
[1:06:28] crying out to each age down through what
[1:06:32] is the voice crying out listen the whole
[1:06:35] ministry that has happened friends all
[1:06:37] the
[1:06:37] down through the ages it's not a
[1:06:39] different ministry it's the same spirit
[1:06:42] of God that is calling the people to the
[1:06:45] true atonement it's calling the people
[1:06:48] of God in every age who are identified
[1:06:51] there in that sacrifice who were chosen
[1:06:54] an elect of God it's the Holy Spirit
[1:06:57] seeking you and I out how does God seek
[1:07:02] us out he seeks us out by his word his
[1:07:05] word goes for us is that right him and
[1:07:09] the gospel of your salvation in which
[1:07:11] after you heard you believed you trusted
[1:07:14] and after you were sealed with the Holy
[1:07:17] Spirit of promise was God moving think
[1:07:21] of how the Prophet takes it but just
[1:07:23] read just a portion of this passage
[1:07:26] which I believe that many are familiar
[1:07:27] with out of choosing of a bride and how
[1:07:30] that the Spirit of God has the Prophet
[1:07:31] standing there in the last portion of
[1:07:34] that message think of here in Los
[1:07:35] Angeles and choosing of a bride and I
[1:07:38] want you to look at this statement here
[1:07:40] very closely and in paragraph 238 he
[1:07:43] said these people naturally Lord would
[1:07:45] give me the last penny they had to
[1:07:47] support the message they do anything
[1:07:50] that they could but all God when it
[1:07:52] comes to coping with it and coming into
[1:07:54] it I pray God that this will be the
[1:07:57] night that you reward them and pour down
[1:07:59] your holy spirit upon this convention
[1:08:05] this gets tight but the reality of it is
[1:08:09] it's not just agreeing with it it's not
[1:08:13] just well the message and we're just
[1:08:16] agreeing with it but notice what he said
[1:08:18] when it come it's got to come to that
[1:08:20] place to where from the heart that there
[1:08:23] is obedience from the heart it's
[1:08:26] wonderful to reference the presence of
[1:08:28] God and what God is doing but this
[1:08:30] message came to bring a real Union to
[1:08:33] bring a real transformation in the
[1:08:36] hearts and lives of the people it's not
[1:08:38] enough to fellowship about how glorious
[1:08:41] it is but even only way you can really
[1:08:43] describe the glory is you become part of
[1:08:45] that goal
[1:08:46] and that glory shine upon your life and
[1:08:48] the glory of God changed you if not
[1:08:53] you're only talking about an event that
[1:08:55] happened amen
[1:08:58] this is to be our life hey man is ought
[1:09:02] to be more than life to us they meant
[1:09:05] more than anything else
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:10] notice when he says and to 240 here let
[1:09:15] me just get record 240 Oh penny cost run
[1:09:20] for your life fully to the horns of the
[1:09:23] altar and crowd before it's too late
[1:09:27] for an hour will come when you cannot
[1:09:30] when you can cry and it'll do no good
[1:09:32] for Esau sought to find a place of his
[1:09:35] birthright and couldn't find it I commit
[1:09:38] you'll California Oh convention of the
[1:09:40] Full Gospel businessmen who I love who
[1:09:43] have left and Strunk you with all my
[1:09:45] heart I commit you to Jesus Christ
[1:09:47] tonight flee to him don't let the devil
[1:09:50] ever cool you off from this what is this
[1:09:55] missus ending here I'm telling you this
[1:09:57] is not a man by the name of William
[1:10:00] Branham hey man this is God himself that
[1:10:04] is crying out through that messengers
[1:10:06] voice what you're doing is crying out in
[1:10:09] intercession that this is the time this
[1:10:12] is the moment if you don't moving this
[1:10:14] time it'll pass right away amen it's
[1:10:20] time to move it's just like when that
[1:10:22] women win the the Bible everything in
[1:10:24] the Bible look everything was in seasons
[1:10:26] and we see how that the angel would come
[1:10:28] down and jump five I believe at certain
[1:10:30] seasons that it would treble the water
[1:10:32] and they would move within that water at
[1:10:35] that time what you think of this that
[1:10:38] troubling of the water whole mouth and I
[1:10:40] love it you know when you begin to look
[1:10:41] at it and how the prophetic eye begins
[1:10:43] to pick it up and brother Ram tells us
[1:10:45] like this he said if you'll notice in
[1:10:47] the troubling of that water he said as
[1:10:49] soon as the person stepped into that
[1:10:51] water he said there might have been some
[1:10:52] that thought it was a wind some might've
[1:10:54] thought it was this he said that it was
[1:10:56] the angel of the Lord that was sent
[1:10:58] there at that time because as soon as
[1:11:00] the one stepped in the water they were
[1:11:02] made whole because they believed and the
[1:11:05] water cease troubling when was the water
[1:11:08] trouble it was troubled by the presence
[1:11:11] of the angel of the Lord and it was
[1:11:13] troubled at that time for those who were
[1:11:15] need at that moment and after they
[1:11:18] received what they need the the water
[1:11:20] ceased it's time when the water is
[1:11:25] troubled to move into the water
[1:11:29] amen the water is traveled for you have
[1:11:32] been traveled from me
[1:11:33] he has come down here in this time in
[1:11:36] this hour notice they were all sitting
[1:11:38] around the pool because they knew that
[1:11:40] the angel the Lord would come there in
[1:11:42] this place and one thing we know and
[1:11:45] believe as believers is God will always
[1:11:47] come to his word it's God who comes down
[1:11:50] and he travels his word he gives us a
[1:11:53] place where we can walk into where we
[1:11:56] who were bound and stricken and
[1:11:58] afflicted and deceived and bound we can
[1:12:01] walk in there and be made whole let me
[1:12:09] tell your friends they're not an excuse
[1:12:11] there is not a reason there is nothing
[1:12:15] nothing too big and too great for God I
[1:12:19] hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:12:21] I believe in praying for one another but
[1:12:23] I don't believe in carrying around
[1:12:25] things that's just shouldn't be carrying
[1:12:27] around we've gotta have confidence in
[1:12:29] God have confidence that God is present

[1:14:12] understand I'm not talking about maybe
[1:14:14] that's where it's a instantaneous but I
[1:14:16] believe in God he can do the miraculous
[1:14:19] right now but I believe also that that
[1:14:21] same God can bring such a touch and such
[1:14:24] a witness in a heart to where you stand
[1:14:26] steadfast in the faith and you're
[1:14:28] walking into your healing walking to
[1:14:30] your deliverance and said it's mine I've
[1:14:32] already received a witness I've already
[1:14:34] received a confirmation from the Lord
[1:14:38] I'm not gonna lay here on this pallet no
[1:14:41] more amen glory be to God notice what he
[1:14:50] said stay right with it until your
[1:14:53] everyone filled with the Holy Ghost in
[1:14:56] so much that it'll make you come to this
[1:14:58] word this is the feeling he's talking
[1:15:00] about that will make you women
[1:15:02] straighten up that will make you men
[1:15:03] straighten them if you say you've got
[1:15:05] the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the
[1:15:07] word it's another spirit in God's Spirit
[1:15:10] is on his word the Messiah then the
[1:15:13] Messianic the anointed word and the
[1:15:15] bride must be a messiah the anointed
[1:15:17] word
[1:15:19] now let's look at this just for a moment
[1:15:21] here in verse 4 let me move back here to
[1:15:28] verse 3 in verse 4 Genesis 28 and here's
[1:15:33] what Jacob remember he charged jacob
[1:15:39] isaac charged jacob and blessed him he
[1:15:43] told him where to go and to find the
[1:15:45] wife and notice in verse 3 here and god
[1:15:48] almighty bless thee and make thee
[1:15:52] fruitful and multiply thee that thou may
[1:15:55] us be a multitude of people who is it
[1:15:58] god almighty and give me the blessing of
[1:16:03] abraham to thee jacob isaac can
[1:16:07] pronounce it over jacob he can preach
[1:16:11] the birthright message he can preach the
[1:16:15] blessing but only one can bring it to
[1:16:19] jacob and that's God Almighty
[1:16:23] what's God Almighty do he follows his
[1:16:27] word his word the blessing is the
[1:16:31] pronouncement comes through the word and
[1:16:33] he follows his word to confirm his word
[1:16:36] that's why the true baptism of the Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost is God's confirmation of his
[1:16:42] presence it's God's confirmation that he
[1:16:46] foreknew you it's God's confirmation of
[1:16:49] his word even where Paul himself could
[1:16:52] say ye are the seal of mine Apostleship
[1:16:56] in Christ notice this that thou mayest
[1:17:02] inherit so the inheritance of this land
[1:17:04] where you are stranger right now the way
[1:17:08] you inherit it is through the blessing
[1:17:11] if Jacob said well but having the
[1:17:14] blessing are they been pronounced over
[1:17:15] me it has the way is declared this is it
[1:17:20] belongs to you but it takes God Almighty
[1:17:23] to come and confirm it
[1:17:28] you see friends that's why it's not
[1:17:31] enough just to set under good preaching
[1:17:32] it's not enough just to set under under
[1:17:35] under word that's coming forth it's not
[1:17:37] enough yeah it takes god almighty to
[1:17:39] come and confirm that word personally if
[1:17:42] not it just becomes accumulation of
[1:17:45] facts accumulation of knowledge
[1:17:47] equipment but it takes God to come and
[1:17:49] confirm that word it takes God to come
[1:17:51] among the people and do a real work is
[1:17:54] the preaching of the word necessary
[1:17:55] absolutely absolutely because through
[1:17:59] the preaching of the word the Holy Ghost
[1:18:01] comes on the scene is that right the
[1:18:05] Bible look out that glad that God dealt
[1:18:07] with Cornelius Ghost send for one called
[1:18:11] Simon Peter you know I'm paraphrasing go
[1:18:15] send for him so here they sent for him
[1:18:18] God deals with Peter then and when they
[1:18:20] come Peter you know he presents himself
[1:18:22] to them he comes there to the house of
[1:18:25] Cornelius and and Cornelius says we are
[1:18:27] all here we are ready to hear those
[1:18:30] things which God has commanded of us to
[1:18:33] thee they were already you believe this
[1:18:37] Cornelius and they you believe they were
[1:18:38] elect of God they were to receive the
[1:18:41] blessing of Abraham they were to receive
[1:18:43] the birthright but notice God has
[1:18:46] someone on the scene that could be
[1:18:48] yielded to that of the word of that time
[1:18:51] in that hour that could preach the
[1:18:53] fulfillment out the word the atonement
[1:18:56] and the Holy Ghost fell on them the
[1:18:58] Bible said while Peter yet spake these
[1:19:01] words not just any words these words
[1:19:05] Peter was a witness
[1:19:07] he was aid up with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:11] hame anyone just Peter speaking and
[1:19:14] rehearsing the events but Peter was
[1:19:17] declaring and rehearsing those events
[1:19:19] there was a direct witness in his soul
[1:19:22] and the presence of God came down to
[1:19:26] confirm the word what was it they heard
[1:19:29] the word and the Holy Ghost came down
[1:19:31] and confirmed the word that you are whom
[1:19:36] the
[1:19:36] right patinas it takes God Almighty to
[1:19:44] come well he's not there then there's no
[1:19:50] one that can bring life it's like it's
[1:19:56] like having a maternity ward at a
[1:19:59] hospital you can have all the maternity
[1:20:02] wards you want but if you don't have
[1:20:03] somebody there who can bring birth it's
[1:20:07] nothing but painted walls it's nothing
[1:20:10] but flowery things and everything else
[1:20:12] it's nothing but a potential birthing
[1:20:15] place what has to be there there's got
[1:20:18] to be staff there's got to be one who is
[1:20:21] there that's qualified to bring birth
[1:20:24] let me tell you there's not a man upon
[1:20:26] this earth that's qualified in himself
[1:20:28] to bring birth there's no one except
[1:20:31] Christ himself
[1:20:32] and he is the one God Almighty who
[1:20:35] brings the birth amen
[1:20:39] that's why true birth follows the word
[1:20:42] he'll send the Holy Ghost in my name
[1:20:46] notice Acts chapter 2 just the
[1:20:48] rehearsing of a couple scriptures Peter
[1:20:50] said repent and be baptized every one of
[1:20:52] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:20:54] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:20:55] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:20:58] not merited notice you repent you be
[1:21:02] baptized but you can't baptize yourself
[1:21:06] into Christ right you can't even baptize
[1:21:11] yourself in this pool but you can walk
[1:21:12] in obedience to the word right it takes
[1:21:15] somebody up here to take a hold and
[1:21:17] guide you through that and you have to
[1:21:19] yield as they baptize you here that's
[1:21:22] the same way that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:21:23] it takes God moving upon the heart God
[1:21:26] moving on the life to do what fully
[1:21:28] surrender when you fully surrender he
[1:21:30] fully comes in this is where for us by
[1:21:36] the body is one and has many members and
[1:21:37] all the members of that one body being
[1:21:39] many are one body so also is Christ for
[1:21:41] by one spirit are we all baptized into
[1:21:44] one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[1:21:46] whether we be bond or free and have been
[1:21:48] all made to drink
[1:21:50] into one spirit Ephesians 2:1 and you
[1:21:54] hath he quickened who's he he's the same
[1:22:00] one behold I stand at the door he who
[1:22:05] see the Holy Ghost who's he the father
[1:22:08] right he he you have he quickened who
[1:22:12] were dead and sent in trespasses goes on
[1:22:16] here is that okay if I read these we're
[1:22:20] in times past ye walked according to the
[1:22:22] course of this world according to the
[1:22:23] Prince of the power of the air the
[1:22:25] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:22:26] of disobedience in other words you and
[1:22:29] our help
[1:22:30] Les Jacob was helped les if it hadn't
[1:22:35] been that Rebecca caught it at that time
[1:22:38] are you with me
[1:22:40] yet he was or danger received the
[1:22:43] birthright but notice how God had it at
[1:22:44] the appointed time here Rebecca caught
[1:22:46] it say hey hey it's time it's time the
[1:22:49] blessing is getting ready to be
[1:22:50] pronounced that God provides for himself
[1:22:57] among whom also we had all our
[1:23:00] conversation in times past in the lusts
[1:23:03] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:23:05] the flesh and of the mind and we're by
[1:23:06] nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:23:07] others but God this is the difference
[1:23:14] but God this is not a continuance this
[1:23:22] is a change of course many men but God
[1:23:27] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[1:23:31] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:23:33] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[1:23:35] with Christ by grace ye are saved and
[1:23:38] has raised us up together and made us
[1:23:41] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:23:43] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[1:23:45] might show the exceeding riches of His
[1:23:48] grace and his kindness toward us through
[1:23:49] Christ Jesus it's him
[1:23:52] it's his working it's him moving us
[1:23:56] yielding and grieve not the Holy Spirit
[1:24:01] of God whereby
[1:24:02] ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
[1:24:06] let me just read you a few statements
[1:24:08] here the Holy Spirit witnesses and
[1:24:11] receives you and God receives you and
[1:24:15] puts his seal upon you and he brands you
[1:24:18] and then just by accepting it won't only
[1:24:23] do God's got to vindicate back that he
[1:24:26] has accepted you you can accept him but
[1:24:29] then if he accepts you stay right there
[1:24:32] until he does accept you so it's not
[1:24:37] just the pronouncing of the blessing oh
[1:24:38] my I'm here but the blessing this is God
[1:24:42] opening his way it's God's grace that
[1:24:45] you and I would know the way there right
[1:24:49] and when he does he seals you in this
[1:24:54] kingdom by the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:55] Spirit then you have your secure into
[1:24:58] the day of redemption grieve not the
[1:25:00] Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[1:25:02] until the next revival no until the day
[1:25:05] of redemption is that right there's no
[1:25:06] ups and downs and ends and out you
[1:25:08] really get into God if you're really in
[1:25:11] him not just impersonating something but
[1:25:13] you're really in Christ you're one
[1:25:14] alternative your whole hearts sold out
[1:25:16] every bridges burnt behind you and you
[1:25:18] got your affections set on things above
[1:25:20] and you run the race with patience
[1:25:22] that's set before you amen that all
[1:25:26] right I've got two more I want to read
[1:25:29] how do we come into that body how do we
[1:25:32] get into it but one spirit were baptized
[1:25:34] into one body and when in that body free
[1:25:37] guarantee of resurrection God placed
[1:25:40] upon him the iniquity of us all not by
[1:25:42] one hand sake not by one church letter
[1:25:44] but by one Holy Spirit Jew Gentile
[1:25:47] yellow black white have all been
[1:25:49] baptized by one spirit into that one
[1:25:51] body through the blood of his own
[1:25:52] covenant and when I see the blood I'll
[1:25:54] pass over you and are free from death
[1:25:57] free from pain free from sin he that's
[1:26:00] born of God does not commit sin because
[1:26:02] the seed of God remains in him and he
[1:26:04] cannot sin be you therefore perfect even
[1:26:08] as your heavenly Father is perfect jesus
[1:26:11] said how can you be perfect you can't do
[1:26:13] it you was boy
[1:26:15] since shakin iniquity come to the world
[1:26:17] speaking lives but when you accept
[1:26:19] Christ as your sin bearer then you
[1:26:21] accept him by faith you believe that he
[1:26:24] saved you and he died in your place and
[1:26:26] took your sins then God accepts you and
[1:26:30] that tells you into the body and can't
[1:26:33] see sin no more how can I be a sinner
[1:26:38] when there's an atonement on the altar
[1:26:40] from me
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:44] the key is he the Baptizer must come and
[1:26:49] baptize you amen it takes him to do that
[1:26:55] notice that the variance is in one place
[1:26:59] to the message you know even in the
[1:27:00] earlier part of the message he said I
[1:27:01] said I don't think we ought to be saying
[1:27:03] that I received the Holy Ghost he said I
[1:27:05] think you need to say the Holy Ghost
[1:27:08] received me Amen that's the reality it's
[1:27:14] not us receiving it it's him receiving
[1:27:18] us hey man on the day he when the Lord
[1:27:23] Jesus is walking into the water to be
[1:27:26] baptized areas being baptized coming up
[1:27:28] out of the water
[1:27:29] heavens are open and hear the Holy
[1:27:32] Spirit descending in the form of a death
[1:27:34] and the voice is her coming this is my
[1:27:38] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:27:41] dwell the spirit had sought him out in
[1:27:44] obedience it had brought him to that
[1:27:46] place amen and what did it do the Holy
[1:27:50] Spirit came down and confirmed and
[1:27:53] claimed what belong to him
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:57] that's exactly what the true baptism of
[1:28:01] the Holy Ghost did it Pinnacle's
[1:28:04] it did it Corinth he did in the house of
[1:28:06] Cornelius it's the Holy Spirit it's God
[1:28:09] Himself coming down and claiming what is
[1:28:13] his a man
[1:28:17] it's him putting his seal upon it's him
[1:28:21] confirming his word to make it real and
[1:28:26] alive to you and I you are part of that
[1:28:28] word Guillory am I thinking before the
[1:28:31] foundation of the world the blessing
[1:28:34] that was pronounced you are the
[1:28:36] recipient of that blessing future home
[1:28:42] heavens and earth have met God and man
[1:28:46] is reconciled our restored Eden has
[1:28:48] begun all the curses gone notice he's
[1:28:51] comparing that future home that
[1:28:53] cleansing and he brings it down into our
[1:28:55] life that type just like all the curse
[1:28:58] of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] accepts see you don't accept it it
[1:29:06] accepts you because it's God's attribute
[1:29:09] it's God seeing himself it's God
[1:29:13] recognizing his children it's God
[1:29:16] recognizing his word amen
[1:29:20] oh he said if the Holy Ghost it means
[1:29:24] God's Spirit his attribute the thought
[1:29:25] of God has accepted you because you are
[1:29:28] Dane for that purpose yet you was born
[1:29:31] in sin but God had that attribute and
[1:29:35] here you expressed yourself here on
[1:29:37] earth and he comes down and gets you he
[1:29:44] comes down and gets you the whole story
[1:29:49] of redemption is told through the
[1:29:51] Scriptures when they took lot lot belong
[1:29:54] to Abram Abraham arms himself with
[1:29:56] trained servants and went down he didn't
[1:29:59] just go anywhere he the Bible says he
[1:30:01] went even unto Dan what was that - the
[1:30:05] lowest parts of hell he went to the last
[1:30:08] fairness place and then he brought back
[1:30:11] that which was captive when David's wife
[1:30:14] was taken captive Zig lack you remember
[1:30:18] he here is he's looking for his wife and
[1:30:22] they've taken
[1:30:23] they've taken his wife what does David
[1:30:25] do he arms himself and goes after his
[1:30:27] wife he brings them back gulfs who were
[1:30:31] taken captive what David was away
[1:30:33] they were taken captive but when David
[1:30:36] came back David went after his wife and
[1:30:38] brought his wife back wasn't it was
[1:30:40] David going after her she didn't have
[1:30:43] power to come back but he had the power
[1:30:46] and authority to go after her and bring
[1:30:49] her back Locke did not have the power to
[1:30:52] overthrow what he was under but Abraham
[1:30:55] by separated lives had authority he
[1:30:59] could go after life and bring Lord back
[1:31:02] you and I were with a low but God
[1:31:05] Himself came down he came down to get us
[1:31:09] we could not get there but hang in his
[1:31:13] power and authority he formed himself a
[1:31:16] blood cell
[1:31:17] he created a body purpose for death and
[1:31:21] redemption of blood that is a perfect
[1:31:24] blood that he might shed that blood that
[1:31:27] his life might come to you and I what is
[1:31:30] that that is his life saying you were
[1:31:32] mine the whole time I loved you I came
[1:31:36] for you the blessing is for you I've
[1:31:39] come to retrieve you you were always
[1:31:42] mine always mine there's not one of his
[1:31:52] not one that can escape he knows where
[1:31:58] each one is at
[1:32:01] and he comes after his own the holy
[1:32:04] spirit searching out what's he doing
[1:32:06] coming down to get his and like Jacob
[1:32:16] his eyes looks deeper than what we can
[1:32:21] see all of the things about our life
[1:32:24] it's not about all the things of our
[1:32:27] life it's about it's choosing it's about
[1:32:31] yielding to him it's about him coming
[1:32:34] and drawing you drawing me to a place
[1:32:39] where we come to say Lord I believe Lord
[1:32:42] as we're believing then what is God
[1:32:45] doing he's drawing us he's pulling us
[1:32:48] he's moving upon our lives
[1:32:49] he's influencing us and we keep walking
[1:32:51] Lord Jesus northern kata I love you Lord
[1:32:55] this is the sounds Lourdes this is from
[1:32:57] me Lord I believe this oh lord this this
[1:33:00] is from me Lord this is home Lord and
[1:33:02] what is he doing he's bringing us to a
[1:33:03] place of acceptance not something that
[1:33:08] you or I do it's what he has provided
[1:33:13] aster provided nothing to make her
[1:33:17] accepted before a hazers but she
[1:33:20] accepted what Grace provided you see
[1:33:26] what grace provided it actually is
[1:33:29] substance that we partake of you love
[1:33:34] him
[1:33:36] listen this is why I just like in every
[1:33:40] service every moment don't let a moment
[1:33:43] pass don't let a time pass when God is
[1:33:47] moving the Spirit of God is moving and
[1:33:49] he's dealing with your heart dealing
[1:33:51] with your life move in yield to him it's
[1:33:55] God Himself dealing and working in our

[1:34:11] himself is able to do all those things
[1:34:14] right while the word is going forth

[1:34:19] wondering he wants to get your mind
[1:34:20] looking over here get you caught up over
[1:34:22] here but remember give yourself to the

[1:44:26] and raising
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:49] think of how the Spirit of God spoke to
[1:44:52] Apostle Paul brethren seeing that we
[1:44:55] have these precious promises let us
[1:44:58] cleanse ourselves from all sin
[1:45:02] perfecting holiness in the fear of God
[1:45:07] the very first scriptures above that it
[1:45:10] says that the Lord has spoke to them and
[1:45:13] said come out from among them separate
[1:45:17] yourselves and I will receive you unto
[1:45:19] myself you shall be my sons and
[1:45:23] daughters and I will be your God this is
[1:45:29] a promise of God when God's Word as it
[1:45:32] comes that's my friends it's a very
[1:45:34] crucial hour it's a very crucial moment
[1:45:36] the presence of God here in these times
[1:45:40] because if not it passes right through
[1:45:45] as the Prophet was announcing for them
[1:45:47] there it'll pass right through what's
[1:45:52] important is it's like everything else
[1:46:01] and everything else aside the Prophet
[1:46:05] tells us improving his word he said let
[1:46:07] everything else go and let you focus
[1:46:11] entirely be linear let everything else
[1:46:15] and that your focus be entirely
[1:46:22] you know God he wants to see sometimes
[1:46:26] out of our life what are we gonna do do
[1:46:29] we value his promise do we value it we
[1:46:35] move toward it everything
[1:46:41] this is for every promise that God has
[1:46:43] given us god his feet you believe that
[1:46:49] so with everything all that's within us
[1:46:51] I just don't want to live under the
[1:46:55] pronouncing of the blessing but I want
[1:46:59] to walk in that blessed
[1:47:02] he came not only to be the blessing but
[1:47:08] to share that blessing
[1:47:13] that's his desire
