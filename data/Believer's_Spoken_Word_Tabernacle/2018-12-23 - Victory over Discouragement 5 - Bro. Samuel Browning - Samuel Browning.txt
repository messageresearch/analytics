wonderful time and I believe that's what serving the Lord is about it's not just here but it's it's every moment of our life well we got a reason to be joyful we got a reason to be happy amen and he's worthy of all worship all honor and glory I think about you know that that morning you know even though we know it's not this time of the year but you think when the Shepherd's themselves were we're told by the Lord go and they came to the place of where he was and they begin to worship they begin to worship based on what was made known to them and that in that time oh my that's why we worship that's why we worship of what God has done for our hearts what he's done and how he's made himself known to us you know when you when you worship when you're singing songs and things what do you think about I don't just think about the words but I think about how those words and what it means to me and how what he is to me because every one of these songs that we sing every one of these songs are born out of an experience real songs are born out of the experience that's why David could say that thou has encompassed me about with songs of deliverance they're not just words you know anybody can write words and rhyme words and reverence presence and things like that that anybody can do that but when it is by and experienced and I'm talking about things that people have been through it's something about it that it's it's a part of a life that's being expressed and you realize that this whole book that we know as and call the Bible as the inspired Word of God is a great redemptive song it has many parts to it many verses some verses that were you know in part where you had a lead part and then once that lead part you know how the rest would blend in but everything in itself love us for one goal and one purpose and that is for the great plan of redemption Amen that you and I might be made free set in Liberty now in this life and made ready for when God completely renovates this place here and then we come back here to dwell in this place that's that's the great hope isn't it we thank God we see the change that it brings to our life that what a true hope that it gives us to know that soon and very soon we're gonna be leaving soon in verse in one of these one of these days one of these objects say like this one of these moments Maz will say it that way whether it's a minute whether it's a second it's gonna be a moment here any moment Amen well we just certainly love you in the presence of the Lord if we could let's turn to Luke chapter 24 I'd like to say we want to welcome sister well Sam's mother it's good to have you here with us god bless you amen James brother it's not grass assembly god bless she's good to have you amen good they have each and every one of you well I'll tell you the Friends of the Lord's are so sweet isn't it I just was enjoying it back there my office man well let's look here in Luke 24 verse 13 and behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlings and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were hoping that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have to another as ye walk and are sad and one of them whose name was Clio pious answering said unto Him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known to things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto then he said unto them what thing and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre and when they found not his body they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said that him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself the Bible says they drew nine to the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with him and it came to pass as he said it meet with him he took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gather together in them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to sign them let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our hearts and our heads and your presence you know father the needs or God that are present here Lord God and those Lord that even would be streaming you know Lord every need Oh God and you are the supplier of all things that we have need of father I pray that God that you would come in such a special way Lord this morning and father just as our desire is to invite you in Lord that you would come and break the bread of life to our hearts or God and may our hearts burn within us Lord and father I pray that all God that for every every request of God upon every heart for every soul that's here oh God may father each and every one receive Lord of the redemptive blessings of the Lord Jesus Christ granit Lord according to Lord the needs Lord that we have we committed in your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and may God bless you as you're being seated I want to continue that thought on victory over discouragement we began looking at this last week with the disciples where they were at we see in this opening portion of Scripture here as we've looked with discouragement that it's something that each of us come face to face with and each of us have to deal with it maybe even this morning you're sitting here and you're somewhat discouraged but I say that maybe in your present circumstances I could say that yes that you could have every right in the world to be discouraged at present circumstances and maybe conditions or afflictions but if we can look away too we're encouragement and the real source of encouragement comes from from the Lord Jesus Christ himself I believe as a witness that he is more than able to provide for you and I just what we need and I believe that he's able to open our eyes that we'll be able to see beyond the discouragement the circumstances the letdowns the disappointments and we'll be able to really to see him because when we can look to him in that way it changes our life it changes an attitude you know because when we get discouraged we could spend you know from now to eternity in the Psalms David didn't you know try to hide it and act like well I never get discouraged as a matter of fact David himself would actually talk to himself you know David you know he didn't have an imaginary friend he had the Lord but David also would talk to himself how many times in Psalms and I find it especially when you get around the Messianic Psalms in between those times where he would say take joy in my soul why aren't they'll cast down hope thou and the Lord you see David was directing he was discouraged there was times when things came around there were times when David was misunderstood there was times when you know Saul was after him and David wasn't a threat to Saul but David as a matter of fact he did everything that he could he respected the anointing of the Lord even when you know those had had mentioned to him and said go in and take his life right now but David at the mouth of the cave you know he stood upon the word he was one that would stand upon that word and he said I hadn't let it I'm not gonna touch the Lord's anointed he is anointed of God and David you know even in that time of being misunderstood and run here and run there but yet he would take encouragement from the things of the Lord and you know sometimes when we're looking at that and taking that encouragement from the things of the Lord it isn't that all of a sudden that the discouragement and anything else goes away but there's a path that opens up to us that we UNR that we and ourselves can actually look unto the Lord as the Bible would say I love the scripture then I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the Lord and that scripture you know sometimes many times we quote it's in songs but that scripture was written in mind by an experienced when they would be in the heat of the battle and as they were in the heat of the battle there in the valley but yet there would be a messenger one who would run across the hills and would bring to them a message that of reinforcements a message of encouragement and strength and David could say I could lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the Lord I believe that every time that God has brought in encouragement in our lives I believe that even when it's been something that maybe somebody has dropped you a word maybe about Tex card what-have-you I believe that that comes from God I just don't I don't believe those things are loose like that I I know as a matter of fact there's things were text and cards that I've got that some of them are from when I even first started pastoring here of things and you say brother Samuel that that seems awful silly I don't think it all it seems silly I think it ought to be these things that we ought to be able to encourage yourself in the things of God even when David himself remember when God had revealed to him the vision about in the opening of the building the temple but then God comes around and lets David know you're not going to be the one that's going to do it but David said nevertheless I'm going to pray for what you have revealed that it will come to pass and David even in the midst of this time he would find himself in in times where discouragement but yet he would encourage himself in the things of God and to think of how that the Lord would encourage David in that time he reminded him where I brought you from and you see God has a way of reminding you and I of where he brought us from don't ever take that for granted don't ever let that get old those are places as we've seen already in the scripture God took Moses back to the mountain even to the prophet in this hour he took him right back and he showed him here his commission and he were bringing back into these precious places of sacred sands of God's grace and reminds him of where he is brought in from because the reality is when you've had that experience within your heart that's nothing that you can ever get away from because it is something that you have become one with and it'll stabilize you in the midst of everything else that might be chaos falling all around you and things that you can't figure out but yet you've got a place where you can set your feed a place that is an absolute that no matter what is taking place it's just like when things take place on your job and things unfold and you think my goodness I didn't see it going this way and maybe you get a new boss so you get to know somebody else and they've got a brand new vision and the vision is lets up heave the whole department let's just redo it over and you're thinking man everything was going just right I had everything everything just seemed to be set but you see within the midst of that time it's things sometimes that happen and we we don't realize what what it is that's going on but as a believer this is where there is ground that we can stand on and say lord I know that you have my life in your hands you have it in control it's a time where we find ourselves examining Lord that there not be any sin there not being any unbelief in my life why because there is a certainty of a place in God where a believer can stand and rest and when all circumstances are taking place and you don't know what's coming next you can rest in him who holds your life and who holds your future you can rest because those are not shifting sands a man's reasoning that is an experience that founded upon the solid rock of the Lord Jesus Christ no matter what comes you've got an anchor and that is very important you see these events that had transpired that they are making known to the Lord Jesus have you heard about the things are you a stranger here you see they're asking in regards to events these events that have Trank taken place they have transpired remember the scripture that we looked at here last week out of Matthew 26 I believe verse 37 or so where the Lord Jesus himself bringing up the prophecy from Zechariah 13:8 that that the sword awaken my sword and as and saith the Lord of Hosts and smite my fellow and strike smite that Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered you see he spoke this and each one of the Gospels you'll find how that this was addressed that there was going to be that of where the sheep themselves would be scattered and you know when you when you look at it as Jesus said you're gonna be offended in me this night now I want to deal with that a little bit more this morning you see it was Anna stumbling or an offence is an impediment it's a stumbling block it's something that gets in the way and this what was taking place was an impediment it was something that was a stumbling to them they could not understand it but you see this is what's important it's not important that we understand everything all the time at that moment but it is important that we walk in the understanding that God has opened to us the light and as we walk in that then God will bring to light those things because let me tell you something as they believer in God friends it's not our effort that catches it it's it's God's promise to his word and we're a part of that word it's just like when in Allah when Elijah the spirit of Elijah came and John the Baptist was here on earth and I want you to think of this they come right off the mountain there where the Lord Jesus has been transfigured before them and they come off of there and Jesus had told him he said don't you say nothing about this vision until the Son of Man is suffered and rise again the Bible says in mark 9 17 that they begin questioning in themselves talking among themselves what is he saying Rees rise again and you look at it they didn't need to understand it at that moment it will even of all their human ability even don't listen to me now the Lord Jesus Christ himself had spoken that word yet if the understanding was not to be loosened in that moment but yet the very next scripture there in Matthew 17 with that same event would actually record why do the scribes and Pharisees say then Elisha shall Thomas must first come and Jesus says him--not Elias has come he has come already he says and then he breaks into the second fold of that in Malachi four five and six he shall truly come and restore all things then the Bible says they're in the verse then they understood that he spake unto them concerning John the Baptist Jesus never mentioned John's name one time in that whole thing he never mentions John's name but what was it was it just the Lord Jesus himself actually him the physical the body wasn't that that he was speaking it it was the Spirit of God that was dwelling there behind that veil of fish and it was time for them to understand these things in that hour I'm glad that God has that reserve and it could bring a rest to you and I but you and I do not have to be frustrated don't try to pry into anything when people try to pry into anything listen friends prying into anything is where you begin to get into your own self self efforts drawing out this chart putting out this putting out that I'm not saying that certain things are wrong but I'm saying that we need to be careful that we're not trying to bring self effort and trying to bring understanding that way but we need to say lord help me Lord God that you would open your word and make yourself known to me because self effort is always something that will produce pride and pride itself is where a person can become so lifted up to where that they're not able to really see the unfolding even though things are seeing speaks of the unfolding but they're not able to see what it is that actually they believe is before him it's a state of discouragement that these disciples were in they were going the opposite way of where they needed you know their their hopes were crushed their hopes were crushed they said we helped we trusted it had been he that should redeem Israel they didn't know but Redemption was already taking place what they did know is redemption itself you know this coming from the mind of God to even where the very birth of the Lord Jesus Christ of how that God had provided now a blood cell that was free from the blood that was already here and polluted and then that day on the River Jordan of where the or Jesus comes walking down there at the River Jordan and the Spirit of God steps down to claim that part of the word that Tabernacle that he himself had built that he had pitched and he was going to come and dwell in that body and through him by the shed blood deliver you and I redemption itself was unfolding right there there had to be one on earth that God Himself could unite with that God Himself who is the Redeemer be able to become one of us become flesh run the redemption was already going on but yet their understanding to it was not opened but it was not needed in this moment that the understanding would be opened in that time but you can see what happens when you know things themselves do not go according to one's thinking and that's all of us you get in a state of discouragement you know friends if we can really really take it in this way you know there are things that even when brother Branham was standing there and he would see the church coming in preview brother Brown never ever if you watch this right here but the Branham takes the thing you thin this here and he never looks at it and says well then preachers what they did he never did it he said is this the best that we could do for you you see he's looking at I'm not going to put blame of the problem on other people I'm gonna stand right here because you see where it was the confidence is God has already revealed the word there is coming a bride this word is going to bring forth a bride the Lord Jesus Christ will indeed have a bride here in the end time that will reflect that one that was born straight from the hand of God on the day of Pentecost he was able to stand there within that and take courage let me tell you something brother Branham oh my he would have dreamed to a preach in a congregation like this with people who are believers and and holding fast to the word but you know what it wasn't his a lot to be here to minister but the word itself that was to come into fruition and be manifested that was delivered and the same one who delivered at the same age of the Lord who opened it to the Prophet is the same one who opens it to you and I it wasn't enough that God left us tapes and books that enough it ain't enough that we have a Bible that's not enough it more than reading more the comparing word to word by steady it takes an operation of the Holy Ghost you with me anybody here you know my probably every one of you on your phones and tablets you've got that message search anybody can punch in a word anybody can search anything now it's not about having the words all laid out it's about having the revelation of who it is that has visited and with us in this hour it's the Lord Jesus Christ we were not introduced to Elijah we were introduced by Elijah to the Lord Jesus Christ we were brought together in a union I'm afraid many times many people have fallen in love with Elijah and not the Lord Jesus Christ what and where we're going here but we'll just go I'm afraid that it's turned to that where they're in love with him and it's idolatry instead of being in love with the Lord Jesus Christ there's one infallible one in our midst and that's the Lord Jesus Christ he's the worm that the prophet exalted in this hour he is the mighty angel that has come down in this time in this hour to take four seals off of himself he is the one working in our midst and in our lives though it could be misunderstood miscued but you know you know and whom you have believed a man in the midst of a time of discouragement and what seemed to be where all hope was gone but yet the word was being fulfilled I'm glad I'm a witness to that verse things that have been fulfilled I wasn't even aware of it hey there's times when healing has struck my body I wasn't even aware of it same thing for you as well are you with me even when a woman how many times brother Branham gives the example Oh sister you didn't think you had enough faith to be healed he said that you were healed moments ago but it was something that passed by the observation of the natural mind because faith is not something of an intellect faith is a conscious something it takes a whole there's a divine communication going on and then things will take place and be fulfilled and then after a while you realize oh my goodness this is gone it's just like with something that you can be dealing with battling with in your life there's something you're desiring Lord God give me that overcoming Grace and strength the Lord God help me Lord God in the midst of this temptation and you'll find yourself in a time that all of a sudden here it comes about and you realize God will allow that temptation to come by your way again and you realize there is an authority that has moved in in that area of your life and what is that God allowed the temptation to come around to testify of his power and authority gaining preeminence in our life what does it do it drives away discouragement so here this temporary and I'll say like that temporary impediment of a stumbling block in the disciples it was just something that was temporary I say it like this the events that had transpired they couldn't understand it but they were not unbelievers they were not make believers it was it was pressure of the time and of the hour and they didn't understand what was going on now you look at many there were many who walked away and I'll get to that in a moment but you see they were believers the events that had taken place it just hasn't been revealed to him now you know that brings us to this place as we said last week that God will reveal to you and I what we have need of it what we have need of when we need it you know what that brings that don't bring laziness that brings a rest don't confuse laziness with rest it's not the same thing rest is where you're in tune with God and you're just walking step by step with him it's not you trying to work something up and I've got to do this and I've got to do so much this I've got to do so much that you're causing yourself to be in such a tight place God can't even speak to you these ain't my words questions and answers 54 the Prophet tells us with yielding he said some times we forget how you yield it and come right down the aisle when the Spirit of God had spoke to your life and you just simply yield it he said we need to get out of this so much pressing and studying and trying to press in he said you need to fall back in love with the Lord Jesus Christ that's what it is a love affair it's falling in love with him and allowing just to speak to you allowing just to talk to you let me tell you something friends you've heard me say this over and over I had God it ain't when all of a sudden I sit down in a computer and God starts speaking to me a matter of fact there's many notes and things that wrote out throughout the time things dropping and things you'll just inspire when maybe I'm riding in the car or going here and there because let me tell you something the computer don't put a message together you can have a computer you can do all the searches you want that don't put a message together a message itself ain't about a search where you just do a group of words and search things out well I'm gonna preach sometimes there's been the things that's been put out there books that's full and they type in one word and print all these quotes and say look at all these quotes but there's got to be a dividing of those things there needs to be a discerning of what said sometimes you have situations and things within there it's not enough just printing out a whole section and a whole document about this that's not ministering of the word that's not leading of the Lord that's just simply knowing how to spell a word hoping the computer corrects it and then you have a whole tag of quotes but there's only one who can really reveal it and that is the Holy Spirit he ministers to you and I just what we have need of it and I'll tell you what's the truth he's the one I want to follow I'm not interested in what anybody else thinks I'll to preach I think you ought to do this I think you ought to do this I'll just follow him the one I've been following because he knows what we have need of I'm glad about that what's this the Lord Jesus now remember they've testified now it's the Christ the Messiah now watch this in John 17 here at the Lord Jesus in an intercessory prayer look I looked the declaration that he has been able to identify about the Lord Jesus I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave us me out of the world then they were thou gave us their me and they have kept that word now they have no look at this they have known that all things whatsoever thou have given me are of V you know this was an important part the Bible says in Hebrews 11 it says he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek you you see that's why it cannot be a church it cannot be an idea it cannot be doctrines friends it's got to be the Lord Jesus Christ that's set before the people I am persuaded that many times it's just been the message by doctrines that's been put before people and people have ascribed to doctrines they can put doctors together but remember Judas had and shared understanding in all the mysteries but what Judas lacked was the divine revelation of who Jesus really was Hey look Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost either the rest of them didn't have the Holy Ghost either but Jesus when he said all of you are gonna be offended me in this night Judas was no longer in the company because what he said I'll smite the Shepherd and the Sheep these were sheep he was talking to the sheep were going to be scattered one goats these were sheep that was going to be scattered not to think of this how this revelation would so strike within the hearts of the believers of here as Jesus himself is praying in verse eight he goes on to say for I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did a send me are you asleep they believed you say well Peter denied him three times but he believed he knew surely but you see where it's at right now where was it that Peter believed right here there was a seed on the inside that was identifying now at the Christ now at the Son of the Living God you see it had been revealed and open to them that indeed he was the Christ this was the very son of but yet as far as by a personal experience and a typos it could not be revealed at that time because the sacrifice had not been offered up and then moved into the mediatorial place it could not be revealed in that time within Peters life but yet to see within it it shows that intellectual faith is not enough Peter himself noticed the Bible says in the book of Mark that even when Peter it records these times when he said I'll never be offended in you and the Bible says he pressed on the Lord Jesus vehemently as did the rest of the disciples in their best efforts they said I'm gonna do this I'm gonna stay with you there is nobody gonna get me away from you they meant that friends they really meant it but you know what it was they did not have sufficient power to be able to laugh it up to back it up you see this is where a real absolute comes into play a real experience comes into play brother Branham takes that example with Peter he said you see he said if it's really not an acre within your life the first little discouragement that comes up in the church out you go a first sermon rent is like this again the first little trial not big trial little trial little discouragement comes up out you go out I tell you this has happened and this has taken place and whatever more but don't get caught up on all the distractions you're gonna always see all types of distractions here we are gathered together as a body and a group of believers and let me tell you something God has a divine promise that there is an elect of God that comes into the revelation of the word that will submit to that word and walk in that light and you see when we see this right here with Peter and with the rest of them they had an ability they could actually look and say thou art the Christ then indeed art the Son of man they could look at that and see it but they didn't have authority to be able to stand there within that hour that's what's important not that you know all the doctrines they believed you see this is why the disciples could preach the way they preached and knew that you first had to believe but they also preached it that believing is not you being born again they knew it by experience they didn't go to seminary come on somebody they didn't go to seminary it wasn't some guy out there teaching them out here's what you do to people you teach them like this this was not it was God Himself teaching them and they could come right back to this they knew they believed and they knew the power of belief the power of belief actually drew them away from fishing nets tax-collecting it drew them away but yet believing itself did not make them one with the Lord Jesus Christ they even had disunity disagreements among themselves they were not unified with Jesus yet Jesus himself was unified with them but after Pentecost different story brother and sister like this he said it was no longer Peter in the front leading it was Christ in the front Peter in the back don't you love that think of this these people of how these disciples were in this hour they you know brother man tells us like this and a message to Lohmann maybe I just you know we refer to instead of reading it but he said of how that they themselves they knew who he was they understood that part of it like we read and the Lord Jesus acknowledged that here and they said we're sure of that you see they had bad ground that they could stand on we're sure of that but there were other things as far as the trial the affliction the suffering and the third day but they didn't understand that but there was things that they did understand you see it wasn't important that they understood the suffering the trials and all that it wasn't that they were we Christians brother let me tell you something it wasn't that they didn't know Scripture they knew Scripture but it took the lawn who the scripture spoke of to actually come in the midst of their heart to where that there was no longer something they were quoting but it was a redemptive experience in their life that they themselves were a part of that prophecy by divine experience and you see they didn't understand it but they did have an understanding to know who he is you know there's a lot of things of times in our life where you don't understand this that or this or that and know how certain things are gonna unfold and if you say you do I'm gonna call you liar you don't understand how things are gonna unfold you only understand as God opens it to your understanding and unfolds your understanding to it you see the only thing we can do is walk in obedience as the light itself is open to you and I the Bible says that the light itself is a path to the jeff's it also says that it in the book of Proverbs it continues to open and become more brighter and clearer under that perfect day you know don't worry about the things that you don't understand it's like sometimes you can have people that come right in here and some of you may you come and maybe you've been here for a month maybe two maybe a few years and you look at things and I'd say like this people that's been around even the message because I don't understand everything you know what me start quoting what the prophetess said to you he said I don't understand how Jesus and the Father he said can be worn and to lean not to your own understanding I don't understand it but I believe it I know it to be true I believe it so you see it's not about understanding because remember anything that we can understand here and perfectly explained it's no longer faith it's no longer faith that doesn't mean that we're walking around stumbling in the dark that's not what faith is faith is a divine revelation sovereignly given by God but remember whatever has been revealed the Prophet himself will mention this in the first seal picks it out of the Scofield Bible by the way that when a mystery has been revealed even though it's been revealed that remains a supernatural element to it why because it's not something that can be explained it's something that still remains there as a supernatural element I'm glad about that aren't you it's something that just you realize it's supernatural it's not been man given so to think how here they are they're walking in obedience to the word then that's what Jesus testified up the Bible tells us in this text right here in Luke 2 for that when they could identify have you not heard of him he was a prophet mighty in word and deed you see they recognized that he indeed he was a prophet mighty in word indeed but they didn't recognize him to be the Redeemer prophet they didn't see it in that life although they were in hope and for that they were trusting in that so you see the veil of their understanding as far as to know that indeed that this indeed was the Son of God that veil itself had began to lift from their life but yet it had not fully come open to them and this is why they're in a state of discouragement and disappointment and let down the brother let me tell you when the rail itself is lifted that's when discouragement that's when disheartened man that's when sadness is broken that's when gloom you know why because when this and when he was there laying in that tomb there those three days and nights but when he got up on that Easter morning there was a rising of the Sun brother it was not just the sunrise there there was a Sun rising from the grave it was a testimony there a price has been paid debt has been defeated grave has been defeated hail has been defeated it was a testimony there's more sons that's going to be rising hey man bro repeater God so to think of this how that the work yet the veil of the work of the Redeemer in Redemption was veiled because the Redeemer had to fulfill it remember it wasn't their cup to drink Peter tried to stop the Lord Jesus don't even not only taking off the year of that of that regard that came but remember how many times the Lord Jesus or Peter himself rebuked him and the Lord Jesus said get behind me Satan thou savourest not the things that be of God but rather the things that be of man they did not understand the suffering that was come they did not understand that but to see that this veil it would eventually be lifted for them that they could Missy it manifested and later in them manifested and through their lives manifest remember the Lord Jesus said in Matthew 26 verse 32 he promised him well after he had spoken about the offence he said but after that I'm risen again I will go before you into Galilee you see the sheep were scattered but the Shepherd's going to rise the same shepherd who spoke in John 10 and said my sheep know my voice and I'm known of them he identified himself as the door the place of entry the way and he says that I'm that I lay the shepherd lay my life down for the Sheep and here he is as the shepherd a scattered sheep sheep that are all scattered they had been all brought together around the promise there in the Messiah but because things were not happening as they thought and prophecy had to be fulfilled they had to be scattered at that time but as he promised after I'm risen I will go before you home ha I love this word go before it means to lead forward lead forth one from a place in which he has lain hidden from view will now go before he was there with him the whole time but yet this part of the journey was hidden from him it was hidden but now he Rises and he's going to go before now think of this how did he lead them before did he lead him by Suns and miracles signs and miracles accompanied him and it also was that of God saying I've approved him but it wasn't just signs and miracles it was word he led them by the word you see you can't separate the word from the Spirit if you can separate the word from the Spirit then you no longer have true worshipers but a true worshiper who's one who worships in spirit and in truth that the word itself is not a letter but the word itself is the living person of the Lord Jesus Christ that actually speaks to our hearts and our lives and discerns the varying things that you and I have need of it's actually the word itself when the Spirit of God gets ahold of that word he can open that as it's been laying there and then what you begin to see is the program of God that lays beneath that capstone or that part of the word that has now been brought out and as he opens it up the program of God begins to unfold you see you can just quote like many look the rabbis even they that were singing the Psalms they sung the Psalms but underneath that Psalm there was something to be unfolded when in my God my God why has thou forsaken me and yet here they were singing that down in the temple but yet there was a real fulfillment that was going on out there at Calvary what was not what was here as a mercy seat that was only a type out here at Calvary the real mercy seat was actually coming into view out there at Calvary they were singing words and all these things that pertain to it they were quoting of what Moses had said and what David had said but you see the program of God is what laid beneath that word to wear when that word was opened up to them it would pour out the blessing and the virtue and the strength of all that was contained in it let me just say this morning the Word of God is not a letter but the Word of God is a living person and when that word is revealed it packs within it sufficient virtue sufficient power my brother and sister it's the same Spirit of God that takes ahold of that word and begins to manifest that word in power in our lives hallelujah he executes his divine authority as he takes his word and by his word becoming flesh then he himself he asserts himself over the very authority and kingdom of darkness Oh mom's so glad that that word itself it is the Lord Jesus Christ it dispels down it dispels these things no Sam you're not what a compliment John 1336 here Peter said unto Him Lord whether goes them here's another account of where the Lord Jesus talking about the offense jesus answered him and said whether I go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards why because I've got to be able to bring you from where you are to where you need to be a man he was the Keystone the breach they men that would hear about a holy God he could put his hand on a sinful man than a holy God he indeed is that mediator among man by the man Christ Jesus you can't follow me now you can't do this kinsman walk Ruth but I'm gonna do it for you afterwards you'll follow me now you can't but afterwards you will Peter said unto Him Lord why Kent cannot I follow thee now boy and Moz will be honest were a lot like Peter I'll go to Samuel I've been born again get that self-righteous thing down you still ask the question why sometimes I know you may not say it out here but sometimes you wonder I don't have to go through examples in the scripture do I and go in through the prophets life himself when something did not happen the way he wanted and that woman who ended up passing away from uremic poisoning and what did he do counted on God and gone here's what the prophet this is testimony it's his testimony you know what he said he said God let me pout that way and sit there because I've told him you owe me an answer God don't owe us nothing I don't care who we are God don't owe us nothing I'm glad those examples are included in there because you know what it seemed like is she should have been here why did why did all this take place and she's not made well that would have been discouraging that was disappointing but you see it didn't cause the proper to say I don't believe in God no more that's not what it was it was he did not understand but see in the wrong humor you owe me an explanation God don't know him an explanation but God allowed it to be an lesson that we don't question the ways of the Lord there's a lot of things that's taken place there's people that's been taken home we would say prematurely young of age and it's not explainable why did they pass such a young person why did they pass maybe they were 50 years old still a young person and you say why in the world sells so much ahead of them why did that God knows God knows he has it all in his hand do we grief we do grief do we sorrow yes we do do we miss I'm sure we do but yet within it all as a believer we come back to say Lord you do all things well and I rest within that well that's a great help I'll tell you what in the time of trouble is to be able to just say Lord you do all things well amen so here the Lord Jesus he's let him know you'll fall you can't follow me now but you shall follow me so here the question of love why but you notice I want to just deal with this thought on the offended because you see it's quite a contrast as you look in the scriptures the same word which is our English word scandalized which is what that word offended means it's mentioned throughout the scriptures and you'll find it aware that the Pharisees and others were offended in the Lord Jesus they were offended at John the Baptist they were offended at many others and it was a stumbling block it was an impediment it was something that where they themselves were not able and did not see and recognize even the part that had been opened at that time they did not recognize John the Baptist they did not recognize the Lord Jesus as a matter of fact Peter would pick up this same thought picking it back from the Book of Psalms and pulling it forward on about that headstone that that which was the chief of the corner he has also made the head and this is this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in our own eye in our eyes or his eyes and to see how that reader would take this up and he would talk about this stumbling stone a rock of offence and Peter would speak of it that those who stumble are those who are disobedient and the disobedient are those who will not submit to that word and submit to that Authority now we could go on into that rock and go on into there all of those things are Daniel but we're just going to stay right here within this that there is a disobedience which these disciples were not disobedient to the word they were walking in all that had been open to them now let me just pause and preach for a little bit let me preach one preacher when you look at this here for a moment you'll see what's very important friends is that you walk in all that God has revealed but you need to have a heart and it must be a hunger that Lord I want to know you more that ought to be something within your heart that you're longing to know him more listen don't don't feel bad but there's certain things that you look at and say I can't explain this or I can't put this together I'll tell you what you just pray about that and you watch God not bring it right across here God might open it up as you're listening to a message you'll find yourself maybe reading through the scriptures you let it be a personal witness because what however it comes whatever Avenue it's going to be called that gets the glory it'll be him that open your understanding it would just be a personal experience between you and him so revelation is always important let me tell you something it's not enough just to come and sit in this church and just to know that God sent a prophet you can know that and go straight to hell I'm being flattening that's being straight but they've got to be honest you can know that and you still be full of the love of the world in your life yet ain't enough it's turn recognize and recognize the Lord Jesus Christ because a message itself and never took us away from the whole thrust of the gospel and that is Redemption it's redemption of the soul that leads to redemption of the body the gospel mess it has never changed you say well this hour this message that we've received hold on a moment this message points you and I to the real true experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way that the Apostles believed it the way they believed predestination this message is not something new that dropped out of the sky it is an assembly of truth that already laid here Elad you never patent those stones up to Mount Carmel you with me he didn't tap those stones up there their stones were already there there are fragments of truth that had been scattered down through the ages and Elijah wasn't saying I think this rock looks good I think this rock look to it and you know what now check this one out let's get that one there were stones that were already there that when they would be assembled under the word of the Lord it would be that which would usher in the very presence of God and would make himself known to Israel that I'm the same God that the same one that brought out of Egypt the same one that rescued you the same one the new your father Abraham I'm the same God I'm the God of Israel he would make himself know by assembling truth and coming down on it hi Gloria and I'm a person of truth how about you quite the contrast of the offense well we could really deal with this there were those disciples in that time in John eight they believed on him they believed many believed or what did Jesus say if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed it's a continuing on in the word I believe that's what the Holy Spirit was expressing to us it's a continuing on in the word you can't live off of something in the past you can't live listen to me so we're both Sam you talked about a sacred Sandt sacred sands friends is a place where you have met God face to face and there's been a change in your life that is something you always carry with you but you cannot just live listen what good would it do for you to talk about a fire that you only experienced 10 years ago five years ago and you don't have that same fire tonight what's wrong where did the fire fall did it fall just on your flesh did it fall just in your spirit or did it fall in your soul because of it falls in your soul it cannot be contaminated the manna that fell on the flesh contaminated the manner the fellow the spirit contaminated but the manner that fell in the cell whether they know maggots got to that that experience was the same as it was on the first day that it failed can you get down and discourage you can but you need to recognize and realize if there's a hunger in your heart you can be like David and say restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit in me so those people think the same you're trying to get her back sign it I'm trying to get nobody excited I want you to have joy in your life if you kind of if you'd go by some people you'd look at it others good looks at men I don't want what you got I might make you a good moral person but it don't seem legal no joy joy and fictitious the joy of the Lord is our strength he paid the price he prayed in the prayer of intercessory that they might have this joy fulfilled in themselves that's what Jesus said I've come that you might have life and have it more abundantly he did not come to give a bunch of regulations and a bunch of rules he came to write backward down in the depths of our heart to where it's not a regulation just out here but it's an inward dwelling that shows itself from the inside to the outside that's why when he became flesh they didn't think they needed a baby but God gave them what they needed they needed to be a birth come in order that you and I could come to a real birth to be to God who others throughout the ministry walked away from him I would understand this is that right these disciples didn't understand a lot of things they do understand but you find many of the disciples they've many different ones that were walking with him they said this is too hard to understand man who can understand this this is way too much you know that even happened with Paul Peter even said that at the end of 2nd Peter that there were many who already unlearned who rest soul with those scriptures to their own destruction you know what Peter had to say Peter had to say about the inspiration that Paul was given by God that wasn't even wrote in the scriptures your honor he had to say about it he called it Scripture Paul called it the commandments of God and the elect said amen glory be to God you see whom the disciples they weren't rejecting him but they were indeed disciples indeed now let's just try to you know bring this on down here so we're about altitude we hadn't even started to dip yet but your little glass of water get ready to finish that finish off your packet of pretzels we'll be coming into a landing the Bible picks this up you know in the book of Acts chapter 1 he talks about how if let me just kind of read over not reading it word for word but he stayed with them for 40 days this is the Shepherd leading the Sheep did they already have the word concerning what was going to happen yes but it wasn't unfolded to them you see they were rejoicing in the resurrection now which is a wonderful thing but and they had to see what does this mean to me and that's something how that the Prophet himself would take that in the rising of the Sun he said but what has that got to do with me you see that's a question that must be asked and there must be an answer to it for what he did he did it for a reason so to think of this the Bible says that after he through the Holy Ghost had given them Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen this he was speaking to those whom he had chosen the Bible said he showed himself in verse 3 of x1 he showed himself alive after his suffering his passion by many infallible proofs what were the infallible proofs that he did the same thing that he did before if he ever healed the sick before he's the same God if he ever delivered before he's the same God he made himself known that he's the same he didn't change in essence didn't change the nature he didn't change in power as a matter of fact he gained in power because he said all power in heaven and it's given unto me oh my one time were the heavens it's shut off but now the heavens were opened hey man every demon power not only death hell and the grave but every demon power everyone that had contaminated the atmospheres he now had ascended up how did he ascends up that obedience to the Word of God in a submissive heart they weren't enough Devils to keep him there you see the power of obedience friends obedience sets you free your the words going forth and you and your heart can just submit in your heart and say that's nothing but the truth a man Lord you know what it'll turn his attention you may not need a room this morning but you need the manifestation of the RAM of Almighty God maybe it's healing in your body maybe it's deliverance maybe it's the Holy Ghost maybe it's some other need but your hearts cry can turn the attention and bring the RAM right to your heart amen we're not living in Genesis 18 we're not living in Genesis 19 we're living in Genesis 22 we're living in the time where the RAM has come forth we're living in the time of the rapture but in our we showed him infallible proofs but he spoke things to them concerning the kingdom of God you see it had the company of there's a voice that had to accompany this resurrection it spoke things concerning the kingdom of God remember they were looking they were looking for the kingdom of heaven right they were looking for the kingdom of God the partner they were looking for the kingdom of God and to recognize that that that in itself will actually then be set up here as we look even into that of the Millennium but yet the kingdom of God if first is entering in through him by the new birth but here in this life what they're looking for they're looking for what they were waiting on remember the Jews this is why the Pharisees themselves they put so much attention and so much detail on the outside they did this they did that they did this they did that but when you begin to look at it there is one great thing that they had a problem with self-righteousness and the thing that the Lord Jesus did what he did that they couldn't understand Jesus never denounced oh no you don't need to do good you don't need to do this you don't need to be considered to the fore you don't need to pay tithes and you don't even that's Jesus never said those things are not good what Jesus went to is the root of the problem is the inside the motives the root and he they didn't realize that first there's got to be the kingdom of God that will move in here and bring back a necessary change do you realize that many of these people they stood right in the face of the Lord Jesus and they said we ain't never been in bondage to sin well yeah for been in bondage to any man jesus said the servant abideth not in the house not a building but here does not abide forever but the son abideth forever because the house belongeth to the sons in my father's house are many mansions there's not oops I we forgot to build enough room oops we forgot I didn't make enough bodies oops I made too minute no it's just exactly what's been needed you love him we're getting closer but he assembled together with them now watch this he's assembled together with them he lets them know wait don't you will depart out of Jerusalem but you wait for the promise of the father which he saith you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence so here the Lord Jesus himself he's unfolding to them the very plan and the work of redemption now remember what they said here in Luke chapter 24 they said we trusted that it had been he which should have read Israel but remember with Redemption there's three parts to Redemption there is actually two where you and I were sold into slavery Romans picks it up Romans seven for that you and I were sold 7:14 sold into sin so you and I were were slaves unto sin but yet we were always sons and daughters of God now I'm talking about Redemption now so you and I actually had to be bought and then as we bought part of redemption is not just that we are bought but in being bought the purchase that is made you are actually removed from the market Redemption itself removes you from the market to where you can no longer be sold again glory be to God this is why the real redemption of the Holy Spirit it is that which makes known to you the purchase was made and you were included and you have been bought with a price you have been brought out of the market and you can never be sold again this is why Paul would so speak in Romans 6 that you and I ought to have such a jurisdiction from within our hearts by bringing our bodies in subjection to the Spirit of God that dwells on the inside and do not yield your members of instruments to unrighteousness but rather to righteousness as those which are alive from the dead this is redemption remember Redemption itself is for the predestinated for the elect now notice within this here how that he is making known to them of Redemption he's got to make this known because the word that they are using here in that we trusted it had been he that would redeem is where one who had actually be as the word goes Lutra one who is actually loosed but you see in order to be loosed there's got to be a kinsman redeemer in order to be loosed there's got to be a price paid somebody has to pay that price and so he now takes them by the scriptures they don't know who he is and yet they've walked with him all these years they don't seem their eyes are holding and you look at it why would it be because they needed to see him in the word he had led them by the word and they needed to see of how the his life and went right through the word and fulfilling the prophecies that had been spoken of him because there was a prophecy and prophecies in the word that had to be fulfilled in their life they would have to have confidence in that word and submit themselves to his work without a shepherd there's no way that it got to the upper room no way they would have got there over the same know their their elect but you're missing a key point God does not make the elect independent but rather they elect quite the contrary we're regarded as sheep and sheep are the most helpless animals there are I don't know about you but I can testify to that I need his help every moment oh brother send me your weak oh no no weak I'm strong when I'm weak I'm strong I testify to my helplessness I need him just like the Prophet would pick it up in the message the God poured that one many times he said I can't even he talks about the trophies he's God and everything he said I can't even should shoot a trophy deer I can't even shoot and catch a trophy but fish I can't even do all these things I need him in every moment of my life he said he is my god he said every trophy I've got everything that's taking place the healing of the sick all these things he is my guide oh I'll tell you friends he's not this being our kind in our life it's not something we put on on Sunday mornings and hanging up on Sunday afternoon it's not something we pick up on Thursday and then hang back up but the reality he is our God he is our life he is our joy he is our strength glory be to God now look at this here they had to know the price had been paid there had been one who was able to pay this price now think of this of how that the debt had been paid he had already been identified as the Lamb of God watch how Peter now picks this up here huh I'm coming I'm coming down I'm coming down we're getting ready here at chapter 1 verse 25 now our verse 15 the Bible says Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and the number of names together were about 120 and men and brethren scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost spoke by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was God to them that took Jesus home on how brother man will pick that up he said this is what's important it wasn't David speaking it was the Holy Ghost that used David's mouth to speak and this was not David's words this was the Holy Ghost do you realize that Peter him in this time notice these very things when Peter said when the Lord Jesus said I've got to suffer I've got to be rejected and all these things does Peter rebuked him but look at this this is entirely different Peter and picks up the scripture from the Psalms of he who was my friend have lifted his hand against me he picks this up and says it is necessary that this scripture has been fulfilled glory be to God it's different you see things that he didn't understand now it's breaking why it's time it's time now I want you to remember the end of Luke 24 tells us they came to this Upper Room not was sad and gloom the Bible says after his departure they've returned back to Jerusalem with great joy remember said they returned with great joy because the promise was sure he made the promise and they could go ahead and have joy you see joy while you were too rich you get the problem no joy is assured joy because the promise is sure I can have joy right now while I am waiting on the very change of the body I've already experienced the change of the soul there can be some setting right here this morning that's already experienced that of a part in a degree of the change of the Holy Spirit where he's called you out of sin there might be all sorts of things still in your life right now and you recognize that but there's joy that you have to know that he's called me out of the world and you can have joy to know that the same one that called you out of the world is the same God that can clean you up and those that are cleaned up can have joy to know that he made the promise he would fill you up and those that are filled up to know you can have the promise he'll grow you up and to those that are wrote up he will actually take us over that dividing line we have joy tell me when a believer cannot have joy little Sammy you don't want a bunch of fanaticism I ain't seen fanaticism I've been able to go to a lot of places here recently within the past few years I ain't seen none but I have seen people that have joy and anytime you have joy there's always wet blankets around but I don't want to be a wet blanket can't put strings of quotes on me buddy I'm not gonna be over there's not gonna be a wet blanket we have a right to have joy in the Lord David himself danced when he saw the word coming back come on friends it was something about the world that produced joy in his life this is what makes me question and Wonder have people really experienced God do they really know what the experience and presence of the Lord is or is it just quotes is it just scriptures is it just words is it something where it's just I wonder what's going on but there is people oh my yeah you can experience and to experience God answering questions the Holy Spirit discerning hearts and breaking that word to our life you know what it is the wild side' world and others can classify fanatics they did the same thing through every time you're off in fanatics you're often fanaticism but brother we're not fanatics we know in whom we have believed we recognize the presence of Almighty God this world is rejoiced into our hearts hallelujah I don't see painted face women dancing around I don't see that who glory hats to one coming down when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place that was a miracle I said that was a miracle they were in harmony with one another that's a miracle the holy ghost ain't even come yet but watch the atmosphere of the word was already bringing them together in order for the fulfillment to move in you see what the word itself will do the atmosphere of the Word of God it brings like it did in Genesis 1 it brings things in condition that the word itself might be fulfilled God was not going to step into a bunch of disunity he was not going to do that but what was it that brought him together it was not programs but it was the very promised word of that hour of which they were identified with it brought them together to wait for that part to be fulfilled in them it wasn't enough that they knew John's ministry it wasn't enough that they knew the second fold and knew Jesus ministry that wasn't enough they needed to have the coming of the Lord in them they needed to have the third pull in their life are you with me it had to come in there it wasn't enough remember there were those that were in acts 19 they were believed in John's baptism the Bible calls them disciples of John and when Paul got there Paul began to talk to him and he realized hey have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe not when you believe have you received it since your beliefs he he realized part of Redemption you first got to believe but he went there and here they were they were walking in the first in the second pool but he goes to them there and here what they didn't recognize that the atonement there's already been an offering up because remember a policy was preaching that Jesus and indeed was the Christ this guy was shown by the scriptures he's indeed the Christ let me just put it to you like this he was shown that the message was absolutely the truth but that's where they were remaining it's the truth this is the true Word of God well the message has come today that's all they were but Paul said wait a minute here have you received the token have you received the Holy Ghost while we have not even heard whether there be any Holy Ghost that's the message brother the messaging tapes and books the message is about the Living God Amen him coming on the inside and then he manifests his glory through our lives glory be to God oh ma this is a day of Pentecost fully coming because remember what a kinsman can do a kinsman redeemed persons and inheritance their inheritance had been lost and he was redeeming his persons Oh glory be to God and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it's sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance they came out of that room they were aware that there had been a Jubilee they were aware indeed this was a day of Pentecost they were aware when they came out of this room here I want you to notice it wasn't just falling everywhere else it came there to where they were assembled by the word I hope you don't misunderstand me I'm not going to go in and preach this but you know listen friends the Bible speaks of this as Peter goes into it here that his spirit is poured out upon all flesh that's why you have inspiration people can write songs they have down through the ages and not even believers as far as walking in the light but what remember who wears that inspiration it's come from you got to check everything by the word but you see it's even to understand that is where did that come from come on now that song brother Brian just something right here I was there when the Spirit came brother Brian told that choir director in the beginning of the insan there in Arizona then he went to sing another song brother brems said sing one a little snappier you know why because Spirit of God had already fell a previous couple of nights ago when that song was being sung let me tell you some the Holy Ghost likes music surely he likes music I'm gonna tell you something it's very very important it did not the angel of the Lord liked the song only belief there are songs that sin they only believe song book they denounced in those early years come on now now how long I'm going here they denounced those things and those are in or early times but yet you know what brother damn could stand there and sing it one of them one of them you know to sing that song you're identified Pentecostal Methodist wouldn't identified you're identified Pentecostal come on friends you know what it was inspiration that's poured out within that time glory man we could really roll on that thing but I want you I wonder what I'm trying to get you to see is that here the Holy Spirit it's coming to the chosen vessels here to bring you and I into that real release remember Jesus here in John 16 had said I've got many things to say to you but you can't bear them now I thought that to me is such a precious scripture because Jesus could have just unloaded but what good would have done well good they want understood it at that time right but he said I got many things to send to you but then you're not able to bear him right now I'm glad that God knows when were able to bear him I'm glad that he holds it in his hand I understand that Paul said we are to be when he would speak of the ministry stewards of the ministry mysteries I agree but I believe it as the Prophet spoken it's not us going in separate it's the same Spirit of God that delivered it to the Prophet and that same spirit of God that will turn around and deliver it just as we have meat of it it's not us prying in it's not us being self-reliant it's us depending on him and he gives just as we have need of it his promise was that when the Spirit of Truth has come he would lead and guide you into all to truth not just bring you up to it but into it totally for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear shally speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you now let's let's break in here and we're closing we started our descent can you see the lights of the city I can all no see the lights of that city verse 14 but Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of Judea and all you that dwell in Jerusalem be this known didn t you and hearken to my words hearken to your words who do you think you are woo but you see he had a word of authority come on friends this was not his words but yet it was his words you see it was words that had been prophesied before but now it's been revealed to him the secret things belong to the Lord but those things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children Peter standing up there being known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third out of the day but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel he's identifying it this is what was prophesied this is what's come and it shall come to pass in the last day save god I will pour my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants notice here's the verse 18 and on my servants and on my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy so to realize there's many that the Spirit of God can fall upon they can experience many things listen remember justification is a work of the Holy Ghost sanctification is a work of the Holy Ghost but remember it's all part of the process of God himself bringing you and I back to himself in full Redemption to where that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's steps in to occupy that cavern Akal that he has called and that he has cleaned up and then he sets to hell in the throne of our heart and we become a habitation a dwelling place where the Lord Himself is dwelling and his presence is there from going forth from our life this is why let me just say it drop this little bit you might work with somebody they can say you know the Holy Spirit spoke to me and told me to you know ask that you'd pray for me well you know the Holy Spirit spoke to me this morning on this don't knock that the bride of Jesus Christ is that the only one that the Holy Spirit can speak to he speaks to us as in a specific way has his servants and his hand mates but he also has there's others that's out there though they're not included in redemption but yet they have enough to be able to ask for salvation to believe the price has been paid and they can have enough have faith to be able to believe God would give them faith to be able to believe they may never see what you and I see that's not given to us or to anybody else that's already determined by God but salvation itself there's people that can actually have faith and believe in the purchase aren't you glad for that man I am I'm real glad for that verse 19 he goes on down let me just skip to verse 22 we just dropped a couple thousand feet real quick verse 22 gay men of Israel hear these words Wow Wow hears these words what an assurance these are not that you can't run him from this try to tell me how are you one of them you're a Galilean I know don't think you were there in the garden you can't run him from this now brother because at that time here the very life that's inside of him was in that corporal body of the Lord Jesus but the sacrifice has already been offered up he's already unfolded the plan of redemption to him he told him wait on the Holy Ghost for when the Holy Ghost has come he'll then know that you are included in Redemption and thus in question will be settled this is something that Peter is standing here by Authority now there's an absolute now it's been unfolded I've not only been purchased purchased out of the market but I've been loosed I have been neutral recovered by a ransom I have been recovered brought back you love him ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know Omaha look how Peter placing that in there him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God isn't incredible on the way to the road to Emmaus they said we trusted it had been him who had redeemed Israel but here our rulers and so forth have taken him and delivered him Peter realizes now this was part of the plan of God he was delivered by the determinate counsel and knowledge foreknowledge of God ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it forgave it speak of concerning him oh my goodness look at all these things coming together right now now in the loonie of the Holy Spirit leading them into all truth things that were they had questions here it is the Spirit of God is just assembling these things and ma they're just illuminated for David spoke concerning him I foresaw the lie foresaw the Lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved you think they just read this they didn't just read this they already knew this but now they know it they don't just know it by what David said but now the Spirit God has brought to remembrance what he has said remember when he was with them they showed up at the tomb and the angel said remember what he said when he was with you brother Graham said them angels were there the whole time that he was preaching and the Angels brought back to them what they had forgotten and aren't you glad that the presence of God and the angels of God are right here encamped among those who fear God and are able to bring back to you and I attention certain things that have been said it's God keeping his word who horribie to God the same way that angel the Lord visited that neighborhood when that's when that little sister was pronounced hold that's the same way the angel of the Lord visits our homes you believe that your witness to that you come that back around and he'll visit and bring things back to our attention it slipped her mind you might be a scripture I quote it might have been something was set here by by some by some individual but it's still God you'll bring a right back you know what it is because there's virtue in that word there is no virtue in our thoughts there's no virtue in our words but there is virtue in the living word of Almighty God there is virtue and healing to save and to deliver when Peter got done with this sermon on the day of Pentecost the people themselves had come to such a place to say what must we do to be saved what was it virtue was falling from the word it brought conviction in their life it raised their faith to be able to recognize this is for me this is done for me what do I have to do to be saved I believe that's what the word does in opens for us it opens entrance for us yet puts before us a vision it puts before so that you and I can walk if you're defeated you get a place to get that vision before you have a perfect victory come on now what's that I do with Jesus called Christ he said here you are he said you're sitting with an affliction in your body he said if you can just get a vision of a person that is right before you that is perfectly whole he said you walk step by step by step until you become that person I'm telling you brother the world is an open vision there is no negative within that word by his stops you and I were healed there is positive within the blood of Jesus Christ because it's through the blood of Jesus Christ that all the negative and sin and everything was absolutely defeated and where that he absolutely trialed over all authority of death hell and the grave that same word is brought to you and I right here this morning that same word were brought right back to John said I saw a lamb I turned to see a lion but I saw a lamb bloody he was there for me was there for you he was there for all of the seed down through the ages he's been there on the mediatorial seat and in this hour how the Spirit of God makes known to us what he has done in this hour and in this hour he reaches back and now it's opening up all of the whole folds of redemption Ruth and bow has Abraham and Sarah the earth it opens it all wide it's time it's time this is the season this is the hour for understanding for a people who by God's grace are ordained to take the rapture it's not by accident that you heard God's voice I'm not talking about the voice of a Kentuckian I'm talking about God's voice the voice within the voice you understand what I'm saying many at Pearl Harbor the Prophet tells us in sudden secret going away he said they heard a voice screaming out he said but they never gave heed to that voice he said but what it was they failed to hear the voice that was within that voice you see that's important to hear that voice that's within that voice it's the very Lamb of God speaking to our hearts brother it's God Himself making himself known personally to our lives this is where that Peter could go on and stay and say let me freely speak concerning the patriarch David he goes on to let it be known that he's both dead and buried his Sepulchre is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God has sworn note to him that are the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we are all witnesses this is not what they read and knew this is what they know by experience this is what's been revealed to them and made known to him I hope you don't misunderstand me you may not be able to put everything together that's maybe not what you're called to do to me as a matter of fact even to have a gift to minister it's not even about you being able to put everything together I understand how things are teachers and how all those things and gifts and so forth would look but remember a gift is not for a man to lay his hands on and use it a gift is for God to use rent held us over and over he said a gift is not like a knife where you take it and cut your way into something but a gift is used for his people it's God using the gift and remember what the gifts are given for in Ephesians 4 it's part of the victorious parade that where it is dispersed out there to proclaim that Redemption has come and is coming fully that's the whole purpose of the ministering gifts is to point to the finished work of Calvary of what he already has done for you and I and that that life that was within him is for you and that life moving on the inside of you and I taking claim it settles the sin question ask me ask your neighbor where these people said anymore not at this point did they experience discouragement after that they did were there times things didn't happen the way that they thought then maybe it should have happened sure sometimes Paul was able to walk out of the city other times they had to sneak him down in a basket then seemed very spiritual but it was God leading you isn't he he's God leading I mean the Spirit of God could speak straight to Paul and let Paul know Paul ducked this way go out this way go up that way but instead God had it to her a little boy would hear and a little boy would come until this guard hear hey they're plotting to kill Paul and so forth then the guard would hear in the Roman guard okay we got to take him out this way and take him under cover and so forth see God has it in such a way it's in such humility it never removed when this came in their life and it comes in our life it doesn't remove humility sometimes we don't know how things are going to work out there's things there's ways that we would like things to happen in a certain way and it doesn't always happen that way but there's one thing about it if we look to him everything's happening just according to his plan you might look in your life this morning you think but Sammy there's mistakes and things that I've made how in the world romans 8 all things work together for the good you didn't say all things were good are you with me all things work together for the good there's things that we have had to learn things that we've had to go through and you have to go through in order to know it personally man I'll tell you this keeps going but I hope you're with me on this when that sin question is settled on the inside the desire of sin is gone and you know I was included in that purchase and the love of the world is gone you might look at your life and say I'm perfect that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about his perfection you and I have been made free from the law of sin and death by the spirit of life it's set you and I free are you with me it's set us free it loosens us by that nature to where we don't desire the things of the world we desire to please him we desire Lord I want to grow to being more like you I want to grow to be more like you Lord I want to walk patiently if there's things you know there's things I don't understand but I know that just as he has revealed just what I need he'll reveal it in due time he's faithful he's faithful and you know what that moment comes from me to step and you to step from this body into that other one it'll be there it'll be there amen that revelation it'll be there at that moment that final fold will break upon our lives it'll be there in that moment this is sure it's a sure word of prophecy and what an assurance I'll tell you this morning if you don't have that assurance like Peter spoke of you can have that you first have got to believe that's part of it and you secondly you've got in part of believing you've got to repent thus I mean that seems Elementary Oh God don't ever let us and let us leave the elementary things but when you repent then being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is what separates us from the world not because we believe God sent a message that's don't separate us that'll separate us it's the Holy Spirit that separates us that is his seal his seal that says we are yes we belong to him we have been bought with a price we are redeemed by the blood of the Lamb all the spare hands or Jesus Lord you're so faithful Lord as we look here more than your word see Lord God how that what do we had testified at that same reality Oh God we're Peter Lord to stand there on that day how different it was he stood Lord with a full assurance it wasn't just an assurance that you were the Messiah that you were the son of God but it had been revealed to him Lord in a very personal way in him and what is you or the son of God you're the ransom our kinsman you became my sword Peter would go on to say as Stephen and the rest of you who were with them in the Tabernacle in the wilderness this that was spoken by the hands of the prophets the mouths of the prophets down through the time this is that what they were able to identify this experience that they had in their life it was a word experience he didn't take them out of the word it brought him into the word to where Lord God the prophecies Lord God they've seen him in fulfillment realizing more God but the word have been spoken it was spoken with them in mind the Spirit of God moving back as you entered in to the mediatorial were entering into your glory you sent back the Holy Ghost Oh God as a witness you were included in Redemption you were the ones that I thought of and I become flesh you're the one that I shed my blood for you're the one that I came for to redeem the son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost or God we find this with redemption or I pray this morning there's a son and daughter here this morning Lord God they don't know they're a son and daughter of God that hasn't been made personal Lord and real in their hearts Lord this morning would you make that real Lord god they're gone from their hearts Lord God that would Lord just thought be submissive Lord God in this place this morning Lord God before your presence Lord you meet him right there or god I pray Heavenly Father Lord God may this be a moment Lord God that they would come to that recognition Lord may it be Lord God the time the Lord for others that Lord could really be honest with you and say Lord I need that
