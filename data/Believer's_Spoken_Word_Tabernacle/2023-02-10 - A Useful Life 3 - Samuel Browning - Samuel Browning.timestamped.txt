[37:55] so grateful for his grace aren't we amen

[38:07] God we have come with an expectation
[38:09] how many times you've seen it that you
[38:11] know I I just there's been some times
[38:14] where there's been well I don't want to
[38:15] just say sometimes is a few times but
[38:17] there's been times where you just come
[38:20] here and sometimes it isn't even when
[38:21] I'm ministering and I it just seems like
[38:23] everything else around you is going on
[38:26] and I just say I just want to get to the
[38:29] house of God I know God's got something
[38:31] tonight or something here this morning
[38:34] you know and it comes on a Sunday and
[38:35] you know that's been the truth because
[38:37] he comes we have an expectation and he
[38:40] he ministers to us
[38:42] the same way that he saved our soul he
[38:45] comes down and he once again and that's
[38:47] what Paul's speaking of in the Book of
[38:49] Romans chapter 8 there's an expectation
[38:51] that we hold we have we have a hope in
[38:54] him and I'm glad about that aren't you
[38:56] amen I don't know how I if you ask me to
[38:58] explain how he does it I don't know but
[39:00] I just know he doesn't and that's what
[39:03] I'm grateful for amen and so we just
[39:06] thank the Lord for that before we go
[39:08] into
[39:09] um prayer tonight and open the word of

[40:11] Wednesday and he and I I told him I said
[40:14] let me know in advance before you go and
[40:17] he texts me the night before he left
[40:18] because I just wanted to even be in
[40:20] prayer and whatever we could do you know
[40:22] and and so uh he's there in India and
[40:25] it's going um really well and so we just
[40:28] he's there till the end of the month and
[40:30] so we just want to keep him in prayer
[40:33] so just that the Lord will just use
[40:36] brother Randy there brother Jeff
[40:37] Snodgrass as well asked you to keep him
[40:39] in prayer yesterday he just went uh to
[40:42] Africa and I think for a good part of
[40:44] the time in Malawi so brother Jeff's
[40:46] going to be gone there for a few weeks
[40:48] so I just uh just appreciate amen those
[40:51] Brothers going and I certainly I
[40:54] certainly rely on that quote if you
[40:55] can't go send somebody
[40:58] so we just I just appreciate that burden
[41:02] and I just appreciate the diversity in
[41:04] the body of Jesus Christ and it's needed
[41:07] and you know and so God knows exactly
[41:09] what what he's doing and so
[41:11] just to keep that in prayer so as we
[41:13] turn to the prepare to turn our hearts
[41:15] to look into the word of the Lord and
[41:17] tonight and
[41:19] um maybe we can just go to the Lord in
[41:21] prayer and just ask him just to just
[41:23] pass fire away in a special way
[41:25] you know I've studied and gone through
[41:28] and what God's placed on my heart but he
[41:30] knows he knows what needs to be said and
[41:32] he knows how to say it and and guide and
[41:34] that's that's every time I stand here
[41:36] I'm just reserved to him if he however
[41:38] he wants to take it and break it we want
[41:41] him to do that so we just invite him
[41:43] let's let's just talk to our father now
[41:46] Heavenly Father Lord as we just are so

[43:59] Christ amen and amen
[44:02] let's go to job 22 and
[44:06] I just um
[44:08] just more coming from this part of it
[44:10] and actually more what it is somewhere
[44:12] not
[44:13] to look more at this thought a little
[44:15] more here this evening
[44:17] on a useful life and I always think it's
[44:20] really tremendous on things of how that
[44:24] God always has something
[44:27] and how that there's things that when
[44:30] God just takes a hold of it I mean the
[44:32] Lord can bring multiple Parts out of it
[44:34] he can just bring one part and you go on
[44:36] and it just it's really it's what's up
[44:38] what God sees that we and I have need of
[44:41] and I was talking to my wife here the
[44:43] other day and I said you know for me
[44:45] back in November I said I'm sitting in a
[44:47] hotel room in Canada preparing to
[44:49] minister meetings and I'm just going
[44:51] through this on the Book of Job and I
[44:53] said I'm just thought I was going to be
[44:55] transported to job 42 you know from a
[44:58] certain part of it but
[44:59] God knows what we have need of and I
[45:03] just I just to me I I appreciate all the
[45:06] little stops that he makes
[45:09] we may not go chapter by chapter I don't
[45:11] know whatever he has in store because
[45:13] we've already seen that where I already
[45:15] had just a little blurb to refer to and
[45:18] then he said look at this and I oh okay
[45:21] and so we just we just are so thankful
[45:24] for that and I want to say I appreciate
[45:27] Silas here he's I he's been used been
[45:29] bringing his violin and he plays the
[45:31] violin and so we're trying to get him
[45:33] used to that right there and so uh he
[45:36] may not be playing real loud but I
[45:38] appreciate him just yielding his talents
[45:40] to the Lord
[45:41] and uh I teased his father one time real
[45:44] good you know brother Brian got into he
[45:46] said he's going to get into playing the
[45:48] violin he said here brother Simon let me
[45:49] play the song Amazing Grace for you and
[45:51] it's just my brother-in-law you know
[45:53] it's just us just teasing one another
[45:54] and I said yes that's true but isn't it
[45:56] supposed to be How Sweet the Sound
[45:58] [Laughter]
[46:00] amen but uh I just I tell you I
[46:03] encourage I encourage uh what what a you
[46:06] know any Talent we have let's just use
[46:08] it for the kingdom of God
[46:10] amen I believe that's I believe that's
[46:12] the thought of even what we're looking
[46:13] at tonight in coming Services you know
[46:15] job 22 verse 1 then he life as the team
[46:19] and I'd answered and said
[46:21] can a man be profitable unto God as he
[46:25] that is wise may be profitable unto
[46:29] himself
[46:30] and may God bless you and bless the
[46:31] reading of the word as you're being
[46:32] seated I want to keep you standing
[46:36] but as we look here at this thought of
[46:39] being profitable unto God and we've
[46:42] looked at this for a few Services now
[46:44] and
[46:45] and looking out that how that job was a
[46:49] very he was a useful man
[46:52] and this is exactly what God
[46:56] intense for every one of us to be
[46:59] and he desires that that we would be
[47:01] useful if you think clear back to when
[47:04] God placed man in the beginning before
[47:07] he ever put him in a flesh body
[47:10] but God gave direction to that to that
[47:13] Spirit man to
[47:14] multiply replenish to have dominion and
[47:18] to exercise of that dominion and that
[47:21] Dominion was not a Dominion that would
[47:23] be ruled out of fear or a Dominion that
[47:25] would be to inflict fear but that
[47:28] Dominion would simply be under the
[47:30] anointing of God's holy image leading
[47:34] and directing all of the other forms of
[47:36] life and then God put that man into a
[47:40] flesh body
[47:41] breathe the breath of life into him and
[47:43] he gave and he spoke to Adam and he gave
[47:47] him to multiply or to uh till the soil
[47:51] to contact the Earth and so it was an
[47:54] objective that God had is that that man
[47:56] and then we know even when God opened up
[47:59] the side of Adam and he brought forth
[48:02] Eve it never ceased to be useful Because
[48:06] the actual word woman means the womb of
[48:10] man
[48:11] so it was God's intended desire is that
[48:14] how that Adam himself how there would be
[48:16] a reproducing of this image it would
[48:20] come through and by that of the woman it
[48:23] would be by the spoken word and we know
[48:25] that that is what was that was uh the
[48:29] fall came not because of the word but it
[48:31] came because man got away from the word
[48:33] and I just stopped us as this is he
[48:36] brings it to me now if the word itself
[48:38] can bring creation and that's what
[48:41] really has taken place when we've been
[48:43] born again because remember when Jesus
[48:45] gathered the disciples at the end of The
[48:47] Book of John he breathed upon them and
[48:50] said receive ye the Holy Ghost showing
[48:53] that man himself that real sons and
[48:56] daughters of God would be born of the
[48:58] spirit of God by the breath of almighty
[49:01] God and remember the Breath of God is
[49:04] the inspiration of God it sets a Man on
[49:08] Fire it puts a man into service and so
[49:12] to think of how that when we look at
[49:14] being of a useful life we come back to
[49:18] this simple thought that it's a life
[49:21] that is really surrendered and
[49:23] consecrated to God I I want to be more
[49:27] surrendered I want to be more
[49:29] consecrated brother Samuel are you there
[49:31] yet well I look at where Paul himself
[49:34] would write I'm always challenged by it
[49:36] when Paul would speak of how that he
[49:38] would bring his body into subjection
[49:40] when Paul would also write that Brethren
[49:44] I count myself not as perfect but I'm
[49:48] striving after that Perfection then I
[49:51] look at that and I see that Paul Paul
[49:53] seen something that was really moving
[49:56] upon his life and remember he said I
[49:58] seek to apprehend lay hold of what's
[50:01] laid hold on me so when God has stirred
[50:05] up our heart God does that so that you
[50:08] and I might have a direction to yield
[50:10] ourselves elves too otherwise we're just
[50:13] wandering around and aimlessly and Lord
[50:15] what what do you want me to do and what
[50:17] would you have me to do but you know God
[50:19] has a way of the word speaking to our
[50:21] hearts and we can look in our lives and
[50:23] say Lord I need that area built up I
[50:27] need that and and here we are agreeing
[50:29] with the word and what does that do it
[50:31] allows that which is laying hold upon
[50:34] our life and US reaching back out to him
[50:37] and saying Lord be it unto me Lord
[50:40] and so we don't as as people of God we
[50:43] don't count ourselves to be perfect as
[50:45] far as my experience and your experience
[50:47] if we've been born again of the spirit
[50:49] of God then it's a fulfillment of the
[50:52] scripture be you therefore perfect even
[50:54] as your father in Heaven is perfect it's
[50:56] also the same fulfillment where John
[50:58] would write by inspiration of the love
[51:00] of God and says that as he is there so
[51:04] are we here we are a reflection of a
[51:08] triumphant Mighty God who came down and
[51:11] became one of us and that same life is
[51:13] being reflected here on Earth for you
[51:16] and I we are his victory
[51:18] so job was job was useful and I've read
[51:21] this quote and I just I want I'm going
[51:24] to read it again to start out with here
[51:25] tonight that out of the message then
[51:28] Jesus came and called and brother Brown
[51:30] said job node he had been
[51:34] he had been this he had influenced
[51:37] people and I I think that's a powerful
[51:39] thing because whether we whether we like
[51:41] it or not or whether we choose you know
[51:43] sometimes a person could say well I
[51:46] don't want nobody looking at me that's
[51:48] tough we don't get to choose who looks
[51:50] at us and who doesn't we don't even get
[51:51] to choose the times they look at us and
[51:53] The Times They don't we don't get to say
[51:55] hey blank screen right here you know
[51:57] like if if there's something I want to
[51:58] talk to you as a church and I tell them
[52:00] back there hey put up put out this
[52:02] signal on over the Internet because I
[52:03] got to speak personally here they can do
[52:05] that and nobody gets that out there but
[52:07] that's not something you and I have a
[52:09] choice of oh but I'm grateful for the
[52:12] grace of God that if we the spirit of
[52:14] God can direct our hearts and say wait a
[52:16] minute here forgive me because the wrong
[52:18] influence was projected why because
[52:20] we're under his influence and if we're
[52:22] under his influence it's a desire in our
[52:24] life to remain as a channel
[52:26] so he knowed he had influenced people
[52:28] his life had been useful God never give
[52:32] us our lives just to hang around this
[52:35] that he give it to be useful for him to
[52:40] do something to tell somebody else you
[52:43] can't talk whistle him or something see
[52:46] brother Brandon is opening this up that
[52:48] there is something every one of us have
[52:51] a part in the economy of God
[52:55] you might look or I might look and say
[52:57] well but what part do I have but don't
[53:00] measure your part according to somebody
[53:01] else's part your part and my part is
[53:05] just as essential in the economy of God
[53:08] and we can just recognizing that no one
[53:12] of us we're not we're not complete
[53:13] without Christ in one another so notice
[53:17] give some impression somewhere an
[53:20] impression we want is that impression of
[53:22] Christ and job was the type of man that
[53:25] was useful now I want to come into this
[53:27] definition here once again because it
[53:30] perhaps we'll pick it up here and to be
[53:32] useful is to be used for a practical
[53:34] purpose or in several ways so we don't
[53:37] get to choose the way that we're going
[53:39] to be used but there's one thing that's
[53:42] a common denominator in every child of
[53:45] God that God will be the one doing it
[53:48] and God will be the one getting the
[53:51] glory
[53:52] the ways that he chooses to use or I
[53:56] don't get to choose that we we might say
[53:57] well Lord I'll do this but see once
[53:59] again that's us putting ourselves into
[54:02] it and he can't use us but he can only
[54:04] use this when we're surrendered and see
[54:07] the value of being in his will not
[54:11] looking at something else and say oh if
[54:13] I could just do this
[54:15] remember brother Branham standing
[54:17] outside and we've preached on that stood
[54:19] outside of oral Robert's place and uh
[54:22] and and until Osborne's place and what
[54:24] did he say Lord I guess you really
[54:26] couldn't use me he looked at their
[54:28] buildings that they had marble
[54:30] structures and here he had a little
[54:33] trailer
[54:34] something that would be you know you
[54:36] would look at and say must not be too
[54:39] much to that Ministry I want you to
[54:40] think of this right here it just goes to
[54:42] show God's Not About Numbers God's not
[54:46] about buildings God's about hearts that
[54:49] are surrendered
[54:51] you could take 500 people but it ain't
[54:54] numbers it's life surrendered to God
[54:58] that's why brother Graham said you can
[54:59] take just one person it gets on fire for
[55:02] God and it'll send a Revival through
[55:04] that whole church
[55:06] yeah oh God let it be me
[55:10] let it be me because remember all the
[55:12] way through the scriptures God showed
[55:14] over and over again I don't need numbers
[55:17] I just need hearts that are surrendered
[55:20] because when a heart gets surrendered I
[55:23] mean we can go through countless
[55:24] examples shamgar get in Jonathan when
[55:27] they went up there to pursue the
[55:29] Philistines God said I don't need
[55:31] numbers I just need hearts that
[55:34] surrender
[55:35] praise God if it's 500 praise God if
[55:38] it's 300 but it's got to be surrendered
[55:40] Hearts to him
[55:45] practical purposes
[55:48] and so when we ask the question how do I
[55:51] become useful
[55:53] it's the same way job did
[55:56] job could have never been useful without
[55:59] the revelation
[56:01] of almighty God
[56:03] coming into his heart
[56:06] and being reflected in the sacrifice
[56:09] that was offered up
[56:12] is that right
[56:15] that's why brother Rams says in the
[56:16] Harvest Time when he saw Abel coming to
[56:19] offer the offering he saw the word
[56:21] reflected in Abel
[56:24] but he didn't see the word reflected and
[56:27] came
[56:28] is that right so the author of the
[56:30] offering it already speaks of what's
[56:33] been offered up here you understand what
[56:35] I'm saying the offering that was made
[56:38] before Calvary when we look at Calvary
[56:40] and say that's the all-sufficient
[56:42] sacrifice and indeed it is but remember
[56:46] before Calvary there was a Gethsemane
[56:49] Calvary was only the manifestation of
[56:52] Gethsemane
[56:54] is that right think about when the
[56:56] prophet would preach the message breach
[56:58] he'll take us back to Gethsemane and
[57:01] he's talking about a battle and a
[57:03] wrestling and out and he's tying it into
[57:05] Revelations 5. why because in order for
[57:09] Christ to become preeminent in the life
[57:12] of the believer it takes a wrestling of
[57:15] it out and getting our will out of the
[57:18] way
[57:19] because that his will might be performed
[57:23] and let me just say this we've covered
[57:25] it in a few Services I think on Sunday
[57:26] but when we speak of the will of God we
[57:30] are not just we are we are not speaking
[57:32] about a job we are not speaking about a
[57:35] house we are not speaking about a church
[57:37] the will of God is the baptism of the
[57:41] Holy Ghost in the life of the believer
[57:44] and then through that will of God that's
[57:47] the perfect will of God and then from
[57:49] the perfect will of God we seek his will
[57:54] so that's a perfect will of God so how
[57:57] do I become useful same way job did and
[58:00] that's why that when Jesus spoke to
[58:02] Nicodemus he said you must be
[58:06] born again
[58:07] because without the life of the
[58:09] sacrifice working in US it only becomes
[58:13] our efforts
[58:14] and we've all been there even after you
[58:17] have been born again there's times we
[58:19] can thrust ourselves forward and listen
[58:21] this is all part of God maturing Even in
[58:24] our own life because sometimes seeing
[58:26] the need we can force ourselves out
[58:28] there and remember it doesn't remove you
[58:31] and I from being a Christian or believer
[58:34] but what it does if we can really look
[58:36] and look at the situation and say Lord
[58:38] teach me to wait
[58:41] is that right because we grow and we
[58:43] mature as we go on so we it's we know
[58:47] that God has a provided way and we think
[58:49] about in the book of Zechariah where
[58:52] when Zechariah is looking at the
[58:54] candlesticks and he's he's presented
[58:57] with a question what is this and
[58:58] Zechariah says you tell me what it is I
[59:01] don't know what it is and so he's
[59:03] looking at this Candlestick and God's
[59:05] wanting to say something to him now
[59:08] Zachariah is not uh uh ignorant of the
[59:11] candlesticks and the operation thereof
[59:13] he's not ignorant of it he's an
[59:15] Israelite he's a Jew so it's not like oh
[59:18] what am I seeing no he knows what he's
[59:20] saying he can say but that's the
[59:21] Candelabra and this and it's in the Holy
[59:23] place and but notice he's aware that the
[59:26] Holy Spirit has come and it's Awakening
[59:29] him as a man that was sleeping and says
[59:31] what do you see and hear one of the
[59:34] greatest things that Zechariah could do
[59:36] that even you and I could do is when God
[59:39] is speaking to our hearts instead of us
[59:42] saying I know that quote I know that
[59:44] scripture but we can just step back here
[59:46] tonight and say God what are you saying
[59:49] to me Lord
[59:50] because there's a lot of things if you
[59:52] listen to the message you're reading in
[59:54] the scriptures I'm not preaching to
[59:56] ignorant people I'm preaching to people
[59:58] that are feeding on the body word of the
[1:00:02] son of man
[1:00:03] I'm not preaching to people that are
[1:00:05] ignorant of things I'm preaching where
[1:00:07] you have read and you're in and getting
[1:00:09] in the word I Trust You Are
[1:00:12] we couldn't have the Liberty that we
[1:00:14] have we're here Among Us without the
[1:00:17] Holy Spirit moving in that way but oh
[1:00:19] how we want to stand like Zechariah and
[1:00:21] say what are you saying to me Lord
[1:00:25] because you see it isn't about
[1:00:27] like brother Branham lays it out and I
[1:00:29] don't have this quote up there but I
[1:00:31] want to just refer to certain places in
[1:00:33] it where brother bam says it's not to be
[1:00:35] better
[1:00:37] that's a natural knee-jerk reaction to a
[1:00:40] person that God when he deals with their
[1:00:42] life is they try to better themselves
[1:00:44] but that's not what it's about
[1:00:47] join a church
[1:00:49] quit their meanness and do all they can
[1:00:52] do but still not have eternal life
[1:00:54] right because it's within within that
[1:00:58] first nature to want to do something
[1:01:01] right
[1:01:03] so this is why brother bam said you can
[1:01:05] join a church you can belong to a
[1:01:08] denomination you can live just as
[1:01:10] straight as a die as a die you know like
[1:01:13] a form or a pattern the Pharisees did
[1:01:16] that but Jesus turned to them and said
[1:01:18] you're of your father the devil and he
[1:01:21] said we're trying to put it on works all
[1:01:23] the time something we can do something
[1:01:25] we can build God don't need our
[1:01:28] buildings and I believe it's more than
[1:01:30] more than talking about brick and mortar
[1:01:32] and and framing up a wood he don't need
[1:01:35] our buildings he doesn't need our
[1:01:37] contrivance he doesn't need that God
[1:01:40] needs our soul
[1:01:44] that's what Calvary made a way for
[1:01:47] because you see all creation was lost
[1:01:51] I want you to think of this as all
[1:01:53] creation was lost and we've read that in
[1:01:55] in John 3 16 and all the way through the
[1:01:58] scriptures as we see there was a a
[1:02:01] creation that was in a fallen condition
[1:02:03] and he would take nothing less than God
[1:02:08] coming down and taking our place
[1:02:12] he could not it could not be anything
[1:02:14] separate it had to be God now think of
[1:02:17] it like this brother random would put it
[1:02:19] how that God does nothing outside of man
[1:02:22] now think of that you've you've heard
[1:02:24] that statement when the prophet makes it
[1:02:25] and he'll say he could have had the son
[1:02:27] preach the gospel he could have had the
[1:02:29] moon he could have had all of that but
[1:02:31] God chose man and think of it when he
[1:02:33] says there is nothing that God does
[1:02:36] outside a man he always works through a
[1:02:39] man because he had to use a man and a
[1:02:42] man is what he had to use to display his
[1:02:45] attribute of Savior
[1:02:48] the attribute of Savior that was in God
[1:02:52] could only be displayed through a man
[1:02:56] God looked all over and think of it God
[1:02:59] as we said in the beginning he had made
[1:03:01] man in his own image in his own likeness
[1:03:06] and then God takes that image that
[1:03:09] Spirit image that Spirit man and he
[1:03:12] places him inside of a flesh body so
[1:03:16] that he's able to contact his Earthly
[1:03:19] home able to till the soil and so forth
[1:03:22] but that fleshly body was never given to
[1:03:25] him as a means to try to figure out God
[1:03:28] or as a means as though uh to try to
[1:03:31] understand him or to in a way to serve
[1:03:34] him but it was meant from that image on
[1:03:36] the inside that would serve the purpose
[1:03:38] of God and bring this outer man in
[1:03:41] subjection
[1:03:42] to that purpose now think about it Adam
[1:03:44] and Eve they had no battle like you and
[1:03:47] I have before the fall they haven't they
[1:03:48] had no battle like that at all they did
[1:03:50] not know fear did not know anxiety had
[1:03:53] no depression no sickness they knew none
[1:03:55] of those things at all and you and I can
[1:03:57] look at it in a manner and say my I
[1:03:59] wonder how that would be well think
[1:04:01] about it when you've been born again of
[1:04:02] the spirit of God there's nothing can
[1:04:04] come into that Soul there might be
[1:04:06] doubts in everything else fears can
[1:04:08] arise but think about the power of God
[1:04:11] that's in your life that's able to
[1:04:13] dispel fear that's able to put out doubt
[1:04:15] it's a place that you can look at and
[1:04:18] you can stand on Solid Ground and where
[1:04:20] no devil can put his money feed on you
[1:04:23] know you have met God you know you have
[1:04:25] met him face to face I tell you that's a
[1:04:28] place right now that speaks of that how
[1:04:31] it wasn't Eden because there once that
[1:04:33] Soul has been healed by the baptism of
[1:04:36] the Holy Ghost it can no more die than
[1:04:38] God can die it can never get sick again
[1:04:40] it'll never be sick of sin and again or
[1:04:43] sin sake it has been redeemed
[1:04:48] oh I say Glory Be The God in the highest
[1:04:51] so God turned right back around because
[1:04:53] of the choice that was made in the fall
[1:04:56] and God turns back around and he uses
[1:04:59] man as a partner remember
[1:05:01] walking down to the Jordan that day and
[1:05:05] when the heavens were opened here came
[1:05:08] the Holy Spirit descending Out of Heaven
[1:05:10] in the form of a dove is that right so
[1:05:13] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:05:16] pleased to dwell
[1:05:17] right it's almighty God coming down to
[1:05:20] what his Temple his Tabernacle to that
[1:05:23] body that he prepared for himself Mary
[1:05:26] didn't prepare that
[1:05:28] no man prepared that God prepared that a
[1:05:32] body hast thou prepared for me it was a
[1:05:35] Dwelling Place God pitched that tent God
[1:05:38] set that Tabernacle and that Tabernacle
[1:05:40] was to display the attribute of Savior
[1:05:43] it was to experience everything that you
[1:05:46] and I would go through to minister to
[1:05:48] the sick to minister to all of these
[1:05:50] things and to shed that blood which was
[1:05:54] not that blood that was already here and
[1:05:57] polluted it was a blood that was God's
[1:06:00] own blood
[1:06:02] and when that blood was shed there was a
[1:06:05] voice that could ring out of there the
[1:06:07] life that was in that blood begin to
[1:06:10] speak better things
[1:06:13] tame voice you're speaking tonight
[1:06:15] there's a better way than the life
[1:06:17] you're walking there's a better way than
[1:06:19] your thoughts there's a better way what
[1:06:21] is it that life that was there in the
[1:06:24] blood cell has been released and to
[1:06:27] announce to you and I you're free if you
[1:06:29] will only accept it
[1:06:32] glory be to God in the highest so God
[1:06:35] turns back around and he makes man a
[1:06:37] partner with him and he does nothing
[1:06:39] except he does it through a man
[1:06:41] is that right he said I am the Vine
[1:06:45] right you're the branches
[1:06:47] God does it through his children
[1:06:51] well how does God work through his
[1:06:52] branches well he was the first branch
[1:06:55] Jehovah's Branch my righteous Branch my
[1:06:58] servant branch is that right
[1:07:00] so he here he was coming to be an
[1:07:02] example of what God himself would now do
[1:07:07] through the rest of the body the rest of
[1:07:09] the branches
[1:07:11] so that whole work of redemption because
[1:07:13] death came by one man life came by
[1:07:16] another is that right that's Romans 5.
[1:07:18] death entered by one life entered by
[1:07:21] another one and that's why brother Bram
[1:07:23] says he does nothing besides he had to
[1:07:26] use a man for that and he'll use a man
[1:07:27] to redeem it back again now think about
[1:07:30] Mary when Mary stood there
[1:07:33] she is
[1:07:34] 18 years old
[1:07:37] she could look remember there's things
[1:07:40] moving on her heart about the promise
[1:07:43] fellowshipping with Joseph you know how
[1:07:45] brother Brown dramatizes that
[1:07:48] and here she has a meeting
[1:07:51] amen with an Angel
[1:07:54] and the angel begins to speak and
[1:07:56] rehearse that message to her
[1:07:59] she looks at herself
[1:08:03] she said how can this be
[1:08:06] I don't know a man
[1:08:08] but God lets her know
[1:08:11] the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee
[1:08:16] you see the word when it came to Mary
[1:08:18] was not a word a question or a doubt Ma
[1:08:22] I wish I could preach right now it
[1:08:25] wasn't a word of question or doubt it
[1:08:27] was a word of divine Assurance because
[1:08:30] God it was in his mind he spoke it
[1:08:33] through the prophet Isaiah and the same
[1:08:35] God that spoke into Isaiah was there
[1:08:38] ministering through that Angel's
[1:08:40] Ministry personally to Mary
[1:08:44] if you can receive it and you understand
[1:08:46] what I'm saying there was an anointing
[1:08:49] upon Mary it was an anointing to come
[1:08:51] and to empower that life to yield and to
[1:08:56] believe beyond what her mind could even
[1:08:58] fathom
[1:09:01] you're talking about the supernatural
[1:09:04] glory be to God and she said
[1:09:07] be it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:09:11] now brother Branham and God's gifts
[1:09:13] always finds its place he says it like
[1:09:15] this God works through human beings
[1:09:19] to redeem human beings
[1:09:21] he can take you
[1:09:23] work through you to redeem Humanity
[1:09:26] he said Brother Sam I need Scripture for
[1:09:28] that well God was in Christ Reckoning
[1:09:32] siling the world unto himself
[1:09:35] and now that that that he has been as
[1:09:38] the atonement has now been offered up
[1:09:40] and he ascended there to Glory he sent
[1:09:43] back the life of the atonement which is
[1:09:46] the Holy Ghost and that same life of the
[1:09:49] atonement is in the body of Believers
[1:09:51] and what is it it's the word of
[1:09:54] reconciliation it's a word that reaches
[1:09:58] out and speaks to the life and to the
[1:10:01] heart to do what for one purpose not to
[1:10:03] unite you with the church but to unite
[1:10:05] you with Jesus Christ
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:10] he can take you work through you to
[1:10:12] redeem Humanity if you're completely
[1:10:15] dedicate everything you are I love this
[1:10:20] if you're a young woman dedicate your
[1:10:22] morals you're a young man dedicate your
[1:10:25] morals dedicate your mind dedicate your
[1:10:27] thinking dedicate your heart dedicate
[1:10:30] your soul over the same I will someday
[1:10:31] why wait someday
[1:10:34] come on now
[1:10:36] if you intend on serving God set it down
[1:10:39] right now I'm going to dedicate my
[1:10:41] thinking to God and if you dedicated to
[1:10:43] God then you've got to throw down every
[1:10:45] other negative thought and every
[1:10:47] condemning thought and everything that
[1:10:49] raises its tongue against the word of
[1:10:52] God you say what do you mean when a
[1:10:54] tongue says you're not blind you throw
[1:10:57] that down because it never came from God
[1:11:00] when it says the Holy Ghost ain't for
[1:11:02] you throw it down because it never came
[1:11:05] from God
[1:11:07] you can't entertain those thoughts and
[1:11:10] go on you've got to dedicate your
[1:11:12] thinking to the right things
[1:11:15] you're going to serve God
[1:11:18] I'm gonna give my all to God
[1:11:21] dedicate all you are and let Christ work
[1:11:23] through that
[1:11:25] now think of this
[1:11:27] how that Paul would write in Romans 6 11
[1:11:30] likewise reckon you also yourselves to
[1:11:34] be dead indeed unto sin
[1:11:36] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:11:38] Our Lord and let not sin
[1:11:41] rain in your mortal body
[1:11:45] well brother Samuel I I'm not gonna I
[1:11:48] don't I don't have no desire to commit
[1:11:50] any sin but don't let any rain
[1:11:53] you know what rain means dwell on it
[1:11:56] think on it
[1:11:58] Ponder on it
[1:12:00] bring it subject to the word
[1:12:03] Don't Let It Rain because if it rains
[1:12:05] it'll start permeating the thoughts
[1:12:08] and when the fit gets into the thoughts
[1:12:10] it'll start permeating the actions right
[1:12:13] it's like brother Brown tells us he said
[1:12:15] you imagine he said somebody just walks
[1:12:17] by you and he says you imagine that they
[1:12:21] got something against you because they
[1:12:23] didn't shake your hand and he said the
[1:12:25] thing of it is they may not have saw you
[1:12:28] right but he said if you don't watch
[1:12:31] you'll be the one shunning that person
[1:12:35] are you going to preach with me or not
[1:12:38] why is that that's because of that
[1:12:41] imagination and allowing a thought to
[1:12:44] reign yeah
[1:12:48] no place here
[1:12:50] I'm sorry when God got a hold of my life
[1:12:52] I am not a trash can I'm not a junkyard
[1:12:55] I am not a recycling bin I am called and
[1:12:59] anointed and ordained to be a vessel of
[1:13:02] the Holy Ghost and if there isn't
[1:13:04] nothing that's profitable if there isn't
[1:13:06] anything that's good sorry put it in the
[1:13:09] trash pile I don't want it
[1:13:12] is that all right
[1:13:15] that you should obey it in the lust
[1:13:17] thereof because it comes into mind first
[1:13:19] verse 13. neither yield ye your memory I
[1:13:22] want you to watch how Paul writes this
[1:13:24] here neither yield ye your members as
[1:13:26] instruments of our unrighteousness unto
[1:13:29] sin
[1:13:30] right it's kind of like it's kind of
[1:13:32] like this phone I got going right here
[1:13:34] okay
[1:13:35] that phone itself
[1:13:38] it will never look at the wrong things
[1:13:41] that depends on who's controlling it
[1:13:44] are you hearing me now
[1:13:47] that's why now I mean I'm all for it if
[1:13:49] a person says well I got this okay get
[1:13:51] rid of that but mainly you got to get it
[1:13:52] out of here
[1:13:54] because if you don't get it out of here
[1:13:55] it'll it'll pop up anywhere
[1:13:57] are you hearing me now
[1:13:59] so and we're talking about being useful
[1:14:01] instruments because it's just like these
[1:14:03] glasses these glasses don't pick up on
[1:14:05] their own a screwdriver doesn't pick up
[1:14:07] on its own a hammer don't pick up on its
[1:14:09] own but Paul is pointing it out right
[1:14:11] here that we should not yield our
[1:14:13] members as instruments of
[1:14:16] unrighteousness Unto sin but notice what
[1:14:18] he says here's the victory yield
[1:14:21] yourselves unto God well I thought he
[1:14:24] just wrote about not yielding my members
[1:14:26] he's going to get to that but yield
[1:14:28] yourselves unto God as those that are
[1:14:30] alive from the dead you are not the same
[1:14:33] person that you used to be
[1:14:35] amen it is a new creation it is a new
[1:14:39] man on the inside of an old tattered
[1:14:42] garment it is a new man by the new
[1:14:45] creation of the Holy Spirit coming down
[1:14:48] and quickening that seed and raising it
[1:14:51] up to eternal life but you must yield
[1:14:54] yourselves unto God as those that are
[1:14:57] alive from the dead I'm not who I used
[1:14:59] to be
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:02] and notice how he puts this and your
[1:15:06] members as instruments of righteousness
[1:15:09] unto God so it's from here you live from
[1:15:12] who you really are and when you're
[1:15:14] living from here of who you really are
[1:15:17] then these members will be given in the
[1:15:20] right way
[1:15:21] you understand sometimes we want to give
[1:15:23] you want to give members I want to do
[1:15:25] this and I want to do that no that's not
[1:15:27] the order the order is first yield
[1:15:29] ourselves to God and then let God do
[1:15:31] with the members what he wants to do
[1:15:35] because anything less than a full
[1:15:37] surrender
[1:15:38] of our own will becomes an offering like
[1:15:41] Cain
[1:15:43] and how many know that Cain's offering
[1:15:44] was Will
[1:15:46] worship
[1:15:47] it was his will
[1:15:50] being offered up not God's will Abel
[1:15:53] offered up God's will
[1:15:55] but Cain it was like Paul writes in
[1:15:57] Colossians it is will worship it is
[1:16:01] willing to God what they will for him to
[1:16:05] accept I will God that you accept this I
[1:16:09] will that you accept my life I will that
[1:16:11] you accept me just like this because
[1:16:13] I've done this and I've done that and
[1:16:15] one big problem with that is still your
[1:16:17] will
[1:16:19] is that right so the only way it can
[1:16:22] happen is it's going to be a
[1:16:23] surrendering of our will to his will and
[1:16:26] let him work through us that's only can
[1:16:29] come through him by the new birth to
[1:16:30] where we actually become Tools in his
[1:16:33] hand and you know a tool itself I mean
[1:16:35] when you look at something that's become
[1:16:36] completely a tool it's like the
[1:16:38] microphone there the microphone here or
[1:16:40] you know this this microphone that's
[1:16:41] right here it's a tool but it can't do
[1:16:44] anything on its own the microphone don't
[1:16:46] stand up and say hey you know what sit
[1:16:48] down tonight I got this service covered
[1:16:49] I'm going to speak tonight no it's a
[1:16:51] tool and you know what it yields or it
[1:16:54] is in the hand of one that if I look
[1:16:57] down and said you know what I need to
[1:16:59] use this microphone tonight instead of
[1:17:01] this one well what would I do I would
[1:17:03] reach down with my hand and this
[1:17:05] microphone it will not fight me it won't
[1:17:08] say no no no you don't want to use me
[1:17:09] you don't want to use me I'm no good you
[1:17:12] can't you speak no it has no will of its
[1:17:15] own it is totally in such a place of
[1:17:18] neutrality to where back when there is
[1:17:21] my will acting upon it it now becomes
[1:17:24] the reflection of my will and that's the
[1:17:27] same way it is in our lives our lives
[1:17:30] are to be lived in such a place of
[1:17:32] neutrality brother Samuel is that
[1:17:34] possible absolutely the more the closer
[1:17:37] that we can live to God the more neutral
[1:17:40] that we can be in everything around us
[1:17:43] that he can place his hands upon us
[1:17:48] remember David wanted to be useful David
[1:17:51] you know and it was inspiration dropping
[1:17:53] on he wanted to build a house for God to
[1:17:56] come and dwell in and David Saul hey the
[1:17:59] art needs to be brought home because in
[1:18:01] the days of Saul
[1:18:03] if you know what it didn't matter in the
[1:18:05] days of Saul they used the ark like a
[1:18:07] Ouija board they used it in a manner to
[1:18:09] say you know what we're in a real hot
[1:18:11] press here in the battle hey let's let's
[1:18:13] go call let's call down to the church
[1:18:14] and let's see if everybody let's have
[1:18:16] everybody praying for us we've got a
[1:18:17] real bad situation going on they only
[1:18:19] wanted to use God when it was convenient
[1:18:22] to serve their purpose
[1:18:24] see that was the that was a difference
[1:18:26] in administration because you know what
[1:18:28] Saul was Saul was a reflection of the
[1:18:30] will of the people
[1:18:33] he could only reflect the will of the
[1:18:35] people is that right but when it came
[1:18:38] time that David here has been anointed
[1:18:40] David's come back on the throne David
[1:18:42] said we I want the art back in Jerusalem
[1:18:44] I want the word back in its rightful
[1:18:46] place I am not content dwelling in the
[1:18:48] house where I am and God doesn't even
[1:18:51] have a house to dwell in what was it it
[1:18:53] was a burden that God was putting upon
[1:18:56] David now think of it David himself
[1:18:58] never lived to see that Tabernacle be
[1:19:01] dedicated or for it to even have one
[1:19:04] place put in put in order one board or
[1:19:06] one stone but what David did with his
[1:19:09] time he knew that God had said you can't
[1:19:11] do it David but I am going to raise up
[1:19:14] your son Solomon a man of rest and he
[1:19:17] shall build that Tabernacle but in the
[1:19:20] meantime you're here to serve my will in
[1:19:23] this generation so let me tell you what
[1:19:26] I'm going to use you for you're going to
[1:19:27] be useful David yes Lord there's nothing
[1:19:30] greater I would desire than I want you
[1:19:32] to prepare there I want you to gather
[1:19:34] the stones I want you to gather all the
[1:19:37] material that's needed but Lord I won't
[1:19:40] be here to see it but God said you want
[1:19:43] to be useful yes Lord I want to use you
[1:19:46] and David was so surrendered to the will
[1:19:49] of God it didn't matter if he was alive
[1:19:52] to see his loved ones I mean it didn't
[1:19:53] matter if he would be here he knew God
[1:19:56] answers every prayer
[1:20:00] hallelujah hallelujah think of it down
[1:20:03] through the Old Testament and the New
[1:20:05] Testament because see what David David
[1:20:07] had to have and come the right channel
[1:20:09] he wanted to be useful is that right but
[1:20:11] remember David you can't bring that cart
[1:20:14] back on a mechanical device
[1:20:16] it's got to be carried on the shoulders
[1:20:19] of the Levites
[1:20:20] right it's got to be carried over the
[1:20:22] hearts in order for the word to come
[1:20:24] back to a trifle place it's going to be
[1:20:26] in the hearts of the Levi it's got to be
[1:20:28] in the hearts of God's children is that
[1:20:30] right so he had to consult the proper
[1:20:32] channel so we want to be useful David
[1:20:34] said Lord I want to be useful I don't
[1:20:36] see what's happened we're in the
[1:20:37] breakdown come God said aha he said
[1:20:39] you'll have to confer with my Prophet
[1:20:41] you've conferred with all the captains
[1:20:43] of thousands but you miss the simple
[1:20:45] Channel and that channel is something
[1:20:47] that's so common to you you think he
[1:20:49] didn't know about Nathan he did Nathan
[1:20:51] was there in his courts day after day it
[1:20:53] just shows you how simple and how common
[1:20:56] we can become to one another something
[1:20:58] that you and I would say duh it ought to
[1:21:01] be the first thing to consideration but
[1:21:03] it shows you the part about Humanity
[1:21:05] that you and I sometimes in the midst of
[1:21:08] wanting to do something we go to the
[1:21:11] wrong sources and to them to the right
[1:21:13] source and anytime you go to the wrong
[1:21:15] sources notice there was a casualty a
[1:21:19] man died because of the wrong yielding
[1:21:23] to the wrong source
[1:21:25] is that right the word's always right
[1:21:28] now think of this useful Source notice
[1:21:31] how Jesus would say in John 17 4 I have
[1:21:34] given them Thy word and that the world
[1:21:36] hath hated them speaking to you and I
[1:21:38] this is the prayer he's praying because
[1:21:40] they are not of the world even as I am
[1:21:43] not of the world so here he was in the
[1:21:46] world but it wasn't of the world you and
[1:21:48] I are in the world but we're not of it
[1:21:51] right once we have been born again of
[1:21:53] the spirit of God we're pilgrims and
[1:21:55] strangers
[1:21:56] right we might live in this American
[1:21:58] body or whatever you know it is but we
[1:22:00] are pilgrims and strangers there is a
[1:22:02] life from the other land that's moved
[1:22:03] into us we might have to we have to work
[1:22:05] we have to live everything we have to do
[1:22:07] in this world but we are not of this
[1:22:09] world
[1:22:10] oh aren't you glad for that the new
[1:22:12] birth it's severed that time and we've
[1:22:14] been tied right back into the Throne of
[1:22:16] God
[1:22:17] verse 20 neither pray I for these alone
[1:22:19] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[1:22:22] me through their word
[1:22:26] so to be useful through their word so
[1:22:28] Jesus realizes this word is not going to
[1:22:32] stop when I die when I Surrender my life
[1:22:35] and offering but as a matter of matter
[1:22:36] of fact he's making a way that the word
[1:22:39] can continue and will continue the exact
[1:22:43] same way
[1:22:45] he's making a way he's making a
[1:22:48] preparation remember remember the Lord
[1:22:50] Jesus he loved the sunsets he loved the
[1:22:52] fellowship with his Brethren he wanted
[1:22:54] he wanted to stay with them he wanted to
[1:22:57] continue that Fellowship but he knew in
[1:23:00] order to establish that real
[1:23:02] relationship that was called for he
[1:23:05] would have to go away I must needs go
[1:23:08] away you're not going to understand it
[1:23:10] now but you will because if I don't go
[1:23:12] away the comforter's not going to come
[1:23:14] you see there's got to be an offering
[1:23:16] and a sacrifice in order for that life
[1:23:18] to come back down inside of you and me
[1:23:20] and then it becomes his word on display
[1:23:22] coming through our life there's nothing
[1:23:24] greater than the display of a trophy of
[1:23:27] God's grace
[1:23:28] by the time I'm not a preacher you don't
[1:23:29] need to be a preacher to preach your
[1:23:31] life preaches all the time
[1:23:34] because it's a trophy of God's grace a
[1:23:36] matter of fact it's one of the greatest
[1:23:37] testimonies the greatest testimonies of
[1:23:40] the of the word of almighty God is lives
[1:23:42] being lived think about how sad and how
[1:23:45] sorry it would be if it was only
[1:23:46] preachers
[1:23:48] right I mean you would look at my
[1:23:50] goodness I mean it's only preachers no
[1:23:52] no no no no no no the word was meant to
[1:23:54] live in the body the true Ministry is
[1:23:56] only a part in the body that's used in a
[1:24:00] way for the Holy Spirit to come through
[1:24:02] that channel to edify the body
[1:24:04] is that right in the love of God so now
[1:24:07] I want you to notice this here in Mark
[1:24:09] chapter 2 verse 16 we pulled from this a
[1:24:11] little bit last week and I want to just
[1:24:13] read some of these parts here when the
[1:24:15] scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with
[1:24:17] the publicans and sinners they said unto
[1:24:20] his disciples how is it that he eateth
[1:24:23] and drinketh with publicans and sinners
[1:24:25] now remember they did not want to have
[1:24:27] themselves defiled they realize if we
[1:24:29] get among them we're defiled you know if
[1:24:31] you touch a dead body and on and on and
[1:24:32] on they didn't want to be defiled
[1:24:34] whatsoever but remember Jesus himself
[1:24:37] was able listen to me now he was able to
[1:24:40] live in this world he was able to walk
[1:24:43] among Sinners and yet still live an
[1:24:46] undefiled life
[1:24:49] are you with me Jesus was not going with
[1:24:52] them and saying hey let's just be
[1:24:54] buddies no that's not the reason
[1:24:56] but he was going remember the whole
[1:24:59] purpose of his coming he's on a mission
[1:25:03] right he's on a mission now notice when
[1:25:06] Jesus heard it he said to them they that
[1:25:09] are whole have no need of the physician
[1:25:11] but they that are sick
[1:25:14] so you're okay and you think you're okay
[1:25:17] remember they really needed a great
[1:25:19] great Deliverance but as far as like
[1:25:21] them committing this doing this and
[1:25:23] doing that no you remember remember how
[1:25:25] brother man puts it you couldn't put a
[1:25:27] finger on their life
[1:25:29] is that right you couldn't put a finger
[1:25:31] there
[1:25:33] right
[1:25:34] but notice Here with Jesus he said I
[1:25:37] came not to call the righteous but
[1:25:39] Sinners to repentance this is a key
[1:25:42] phrase
[1:25:43] this is very crucial Even in our our
[1:25:46] witnessing our walk among our loved ones
[1:25:48] among our family among our co-workers we
[1:25:51] have not gathered to be around them as
[1:25:54] though to become buddies I I listen
[1:25:56] friends I love I love being friendly
[1:25:57] with people one of the things I look at
[1:25:59] many times I go places and I know it's
[1:26:01] just some of my makeup sometimes if I
[1:26:03] see somebody I try to lighten it up a
[1:26:05] little bit try to talk to him a little
[1:26:06] bit you know when I go there you know to
[1:26:08] the meat counter at Fligners or whatever
[1:26:09] more and many of them you know they know
[1:26:11] me and we'll talk and things but
[1:26:13] sometimes you see where people are going
[1:26:14] through so many different things and
[1:26:16] whether it's a waiter a waitress or
[1:26:17] whatever you try to express certain
[1:26:19] things that ain't build me up that's
[1:26:21] just that's just part of my makeup I
[1:26:22] don't like seeing people down but you
[1:26:24] know there's a part of it when sometimes
[1:26:26] just a kind word just some little word
[1:26:28] that can be said I I want to leave
[1:26:30] somebody's day a little bit better after
[1:26:32] I've been there than it was before I got
[1:26:34] there it doesn't mean I got to do
[1:26:36] headstands and you know spit out things
[1:26:38] out of my mouth but just to show a
[1:26:40] little bit of kindness and a little bit
[1:26:42] of compassion to somebody oh my I would
[1:26:45] give that testimony now you've already
[1:26:46] heard it what brother Daryl told but I
[1:26:48] just can't forsake a time but notice
[1:26:50] come to call the righteous I'm not come
[1:26:52] to call them but Sinners to repentance
[1:26:54] so it shows there must be a standard
[1:26:57] when Jesus went to their house Jesus was
[1:27:00] not a compromiser Jesus was not going
[1:27:03] there because of a party he was going
[1:27:05] there because some of his children are
[1:27:07] there I believe as the children of God
[1:27:10] that we are to be led by the spirit of
[1:27:13] almighty God sometimes we wonder why why
[1:27:16] this one and why this one I've witnessed
[1:27:18] to this one and I've I've talked to this
[1:27:20] one and I don't see them coming maybe it
[1:27:22] was our efforts maybe it's not for them
[1:27:25] or maybe there has to be a time to come
[1:27:28] that God will move on their heart the
[1:27:30] greatest thing we can do is if we've
[1:27:32] been an expression keep on expressing
[1:27:34] the love of God and leave everything in
[1:27:37] the hands of almighty God don't get
[1:27:40] discouraged about it you might say well
[1:27:42] there may never ever see this message of
[1:27:44] the hour they may not be ordained to see
[1:27:47] the message of the hour but maybe they
[1:27:50] are ordained to see what little bit of
[1:27:52] life that they're able to see and the
[1:27:54] light of God and you can encourage them
[1:27:56] to be all they should be for what God's
[1:27:59] called them to be
[1:28:01] is that right so it's a standard of the
[1:28:03] Living Word now that standard never
[1:28:05] compromised Jesus never stopped being
[1:28:07] the son of man when he went in Matthew's
[1:28:09] house
[1:28:11] are you hearing me if there's some place
[1:28:13] that you're going that you've got to
[1:28:14] stop being the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:16] better not be going
[1:28:20] things you're doing that well you know
[1:28:22] what let all whatever you do in word or
[1:28:24] deed if you can't do it in the name of
[1:28:25] Jesus Christ then you better not be
[1:28:27] doing it
[1:28:29] is that right so everything we do so
[1:28:31] Jesus never all of a sudden became
[1:28:34] sinful and then he came out of Matthew's
[1:28:36] house and well I'm going to repent you
[1:28:38] know I God die you know I got among all
[1:28:40] them and I just couldn't know there was
[1:28:42] a standard but remember listen to me now
[1:28:44] that standard that was being reflected
[1:28:46] through his life it was that life being
[1:28:50] useful to do what what was he calling
[1:28:52] Matthew to he was calling Matthew to
[1:28:55] that life that was within Matthew that
[1:28:58] was calling out like a deep call into a
[1:29:00] deep like those who were sitting around
[1:29:03] there what was it doing it was calling
[1:29:05] them to the person of eternal life
[1:29:08] himself and that's what the standard of
[1:29:10] the Living Word of God is in the bright
[1:29:13] body of Jesus Christ it's a standard
[1:29:15] that the world will laugh at the world
[1:29:17] will make fun at and the world will say
[1:29:19] why are you judging me we're not judging
[1:29:21] you it is the life inside of us it is
[1:29:24] the life of this word and listen we're
[1:29:27] not compromising on that word word we're
[1:29:29] not budging off of that word because
[1:29:32] that is the source of life
[1:29:36] is that right
[1:29:40] it's a standard of the Living Word
[1:29:44] I'll never forget when my
[1:29:47] when my mom you know
[1:29:48] let me just read this quote here
[1:29:51] and leave my mom wondering like dear
[1:29:53] Lord please take off his mind if it's
[1:29:54] not good
[1:29:56] if I forget it somebody said your mom
[1:29:58] your mom's job some of her bosses
[1:30:02] you got my permission to speak out it's
[1:30:05] a standard of living because you see
[1:30:06] what that you see well listen the
[1:30:08] presence of God in our life should bring
[1:30:10] conviction
[1:30:12] I know we're living in places it's just
[1:30:15] like you know sometimes you get around
[1:30:16] people and here they'll you know rip
[1:30:18] some words off we'll do something like
[1:30:19] that and sometimes you know there's
[1:30:21] nothing you can do within that moment
[1:30:23] but you know I've had them where they
[1:30:24] came in my classroom and all of a sudden
[1:30:26] they might have been a substitute
[1:30:27] teacher they didn't know me and they
[1:30:28] came in and all of a sudden here they
[1:30:30] would you know go right into a joke
[1:30:33] huh
[1:30:34] and they would look at me and say
[1:30:37] you don't you didn't like I said no I
[1:30:38] said I'm a Christian
[1:30:39] I said I don't talk like that
[1:30:42] I don't know what you are but I'm a
[1:30:44] Christian I'm not here to put you down
[1:30:45] or shame you but there's a standard
[1:30:46] somebody's got to say it
[1:30:48] right right it's just like I had a woman
[1:30:50] come by my room the one time here she
[1:30:51] was 70 some years old woman sweet sweet
[1:30:53] old lady and she came by my room one of
[1:30:55] the first years of teachers hey hey Sam
[1:30:57] guess what she said it's happy hour
[1:30:59] today
[1:31:01] I said happy hour now I knew what
[1:31:03] happened I was she said it's happy hour
[1:31:06] I said oh Betty I said I don't go to
[1:31:08] happy hour
[1:31:09] she said why not I said I'm a Christian
[1:31:12] she said well I am too
[1:31:15] I said well there's something I said
[1:31:17] that changed in me
[1:31:19] that took that out of me
[1:31:21] but I have a happy hour it's every hour
[1:31:23] of the day
[1:31:25] I got drunk one time and I'm drunk all
[1:31:27] the time
[1:31:32] Glory
[1:31:34] no brother this message just fits me
[1:31:37] notice God hates sin but he loves a
[1:31:40] sinner he loves you so much that he gave
[1:31:42] his only begotten son that he might
[1:31:44] drink the bitter cup for you he became
[1:31:48] you that you might become him he become
[1:31:51] a sinner separated from the father when
[1:31:54] he screamed my God why is Thou forsaken
[1:31:57] me he was separated from God in his
[1:32:00] death that you in your death might have
[1:32:03] God's presence he became a child of sin
[1:32:06] your sins not his own yours that you
[1:32:10] might become a child of obedience
[1:32:13] he took your place as a Time creature
[1:32:16] that you might take his as an eternal
[1:32:19] son and daughter of God don't even seem
[1:32:22] fair does it I mean to me I'm thankful
[1:32:24] for it right
[1:32:26] it'd be like if somebody you know I was
[1:32:28] able to trade in you know one of my
[1:32:30] vehicles and somebody said here here's a
[1:32:31] brand new car here's a brand new I don't
[1:32:33] know whatever you'd say and I'd look at
[1:32:35] oh my goodness my I would think man I'm
[1:32:37] getting a good deal here are you hearing
[1:32:39] me now
[1:32:40] you know it'd be like somebody taking
[1:32:42] our tricycle away and giving us a big
[1:32:43] tis 10 10 speed when we're ready to ride
[1:32:45] it man we'd look at and say I got the
[1:32:48] better end of the deal
[1:32:50] oh but think what he gained from it
[1:32:53] think what he gained he gained our
[1:32:56] fellowship
[1:32:58] through the Redemption of his blood that
[1:33:00] he can come down at any time
[1:33:02] and fellowship with your eye
[1:33:05] I know you might look at it I might look
[1:33:07] like and I say me
[1:33:09] me
[1:33:11] but you was worth it
[1:33:13] because to love somebody
[1:33:15] it's a risk how many you know what I'm
[1:33:18] talking about
[1:33:19] sometimes you might get you know let
[1:33:21] down with love but it's always a risk
[1:33:23] and Jesus said it's worth the risk
[1:33:27] to lay down my life
[1:33:30] for my sheep
[1:33:34] could I have just a minute or so
[1:33:36] let me finish on this
[1:33:38] this is where it takes remember in the
[1:33:40] standard of the word living in US
[1:33:43] were constantly brought to a moment
[1:33:47] of standing loyal you can think back
[1:33:49] through your life and even now
[1:33:51] there's decisions we come to where we've
[1:33:53] got to make a decision to stand loyal is
[1:33:55] that right
[1:33:56] it can many different ways and facets of
[1:33:58] life but brother Brandon let's just
[1:34:00] break into this a minute brother Brahm
[1:34:01] is looking at a young person in the
[1:34:03] assembly brother Brian says they're a
[1:34:04] young Christian and questions and
[1:34:05] answers that's been sitting here right
[1:34:07] before me and I know a decision
[1:34:10] that that person made and I certainly
[1:34:13] appreciate it I'm not going to say or I
[1:34:15] wouldn't say who it was but I appreciate
[1:34:18] a decision
[1:34:19] that this certain Christian regardless
[1:34:21] of
[1:34:22] even to whether it would be an associate
[1:34:25] a friend a father or mother or whatever
[1:34:28] it was they longed to stand loyal
[1:34:32] to Christ
[1:34:33] so brother brahm's not giving any
[1:34:35] specifics but he's recognizing here's a
[1:34:37] young Christian that's had to make a
[1:34:40] decision
[1:34:41] to make a stand
[1:34:43] to remain loyal to Christ whether it was
[1:34:47] father mother friend associate didn't
[1:34:50] matter who it was
[1:34:51] now I look at that if the prophet could
[1:34:53] look at that and see that I know what it
[1:34:55] I know you and I I mean what it means to
[1:34:57] one another to know that there are
[1:34:59] decisions that you and I make
[1:35:02] to stand loyal to him
[1:35:04] now you think if brother Branham saw
[1:35:06] that think about what the Lord Jesus was
[1:35:08] looking at
[1:35:10] that's myself
[1:35:13] I know it was hard on him
[1:35:15] but they made the right decision
[1:35:17] and watch
[1:35:19] how how many could say Lord I want to
[1:35:21] win loved ones
[1:35:23] right we want to see our loved ones if
[1:35:24] you don't want to see your loved ones
[1:35:25] you you need help right now watch right
[1:35:28] in this same quote
[1:35:29] that's the way you win a loved one
[1:35:34] so you mean stand loyal to what I
[1:35:36] believe even if it means not going along
[1:35:39] with them you want to win them what are
[1:35:41] you trying to draw them to well I just
[1:35:43] want to have fellowship with them I just
[1:35:45] wanna that's a selfish reason
[1:35:48] he didn't go to Calvary for himself
[1:35:51] he crucified his own will
[1:35:54] so that he might have Fellowship
[1:35:56] with you and I
[1:35:58] there would be a Divine Fellowship not a
[1:36:00] fellowship where you could have a man
[1:36:02] like Peter that all of a sudden would
[1:36:03] turn his back and run on him but a
[1:36:05] fellowship that would come inside by the
[1:36:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the way
[1:36:09] you win of loved one is by being loyal
[1:36:14] not loyal to them
[1:36:16] because that can lead you astray
[1:36:19] is that right
[1:36:21] but being loyal is the way you win loved
[1:36:24] ones so stay to your conviction
[1:36:28] be sure that you're right with God and
[1:36:32] then ever remain there
[1:36:35] wow just stay right with it nothing can
[1:36:38] ever move you from it if you'll just
[1:36:40] stay right with it
[1:36:43] now let me finish on this
[1:36:46] now we're all going to make mistakes
[1:36:48] just remember
[1:36:50] and when you're looking at one another
[1:36:52] don't look at that other person quote
[1:36:54] same quote when you don't look at that
[1:36:56] other person's mistake
[1:36:57] so you don't do that because remember
[1:36:59] you make mistakes too anybody here
[1:37:02] mistake free I know they got everything
[1:37:03] sugar-free fat-free mistake I wish we
[1:37:06] hadn't
[1:37:07] it's like them online things that is
[1:37:09] sugar-free You Spin The Box on them a
[1:37:10] little bit a lot of times when it says
[1:37:12] fat free look at what else they've added
[1:37:14] you say how do you know because I've
[1:37:16] inspected it
[1:37:19] all right there ain't nothing free
[1:37:21] my mama told me there want no free
[1:37:24] lunches boy
[1:37:26] is that right
[1:37:28] Publishers Clearing House throw it in
[1:37:30] the trash ain't no such thing
[1:37:33] you want a brand new car ain't no such
[1:37:36] thing
[1:37:38] right
[1:37:43] because remember you make mistakes too
[1:37:45] but look to Christ who is guiding this
[1:37:49] person so
[1:37:51] instead of focusing on the person
[1:37:54] look to Christ who's guiding them well
[1:37:57] what does that do well that helps me and
[1:37:59] you remain in a useful
[1:38:01] practical
[1:38:03] way to God
[1:38:06] right
[1:38:08] I won't ask you to raise your hands
[1:38:09] because sometimes that can be awful
[1:38:10] challenging right because what we see is
[1:38:12] the flesh
[1:38:14] are you hearing me
[1:38:16] now notice
[1:38:17] but look to Christ who is guiding the
[1:38:19] person and if they need some help
[1:38:23] then you pray for them
[1:38:26] not pray Lord strike them down
[1:38:32] I can't even get the scriptures on that
[1:38:33] tonight
[1:38:36] that's the way we get along
[1:38:39] pray
[1:38:41] how many want to be useful
[1:38:43] I do
[1:38:45] like I said I think it was last week we
[1:38:46] all would raise our hands if the Lord
[1:38:48] said who'd like to walk on water for me
[1:38:49] tonight
[1:38:51] Lord I will sacrifice I will do that
[1:38:53] gladly for you I will take that burden
[1:38:56] but what if he asked the question
[1:38:59] who'd like to be useful for me tonight
[1:39:01] to go through a test to go through a
[1:39:03] trial
[1:39:04] who'd like to be useful
[1:39:06] to pray for situations who'd like to be
[1:39:10] useful see sometimes the useful remember
[1:39:12] what the definition practical
[1:39:15] purposes
[1:39:16] so the revelation of God's word comes
[1:39:19] down
[1:39:20] to walk in shoe leather
[1:39:22] to walk in our lives to be used in a
[1:39:26] practical manner
[1:39:28] that's why I love when we look at the
[1:39:29] message of the hour and I look at the
[1:39:31] seals I see the seals in the family see
[1:39:33] the church ages in the family see it in
[1:39:35] our lives see it in our homes you can
[1:39:36] bring it right down it don't stay out
[1:39:38] there indoctrine of where people are
[1:39:39] looking at like whoa look at that chart
[1:39:42] I appreciate charts but if what's there
[1:39:44] don't come down here and give me Grace
[1:39:46] and help me to live then what good is
[1:39:48] the charts but I believe that
[1:39:50] application that took the cover off of
[1:39:51] Satan I believe that same Holy Ghost is
[1:39:54] here tonight I believe he's in my life
[1:39:56] he's in your life to do what take the
[1:39:59] cover of Satan
[1:40:02] foreign
[1:40:04] I want to be used that way
[1:40:10] Hallelujah
[1:40:12] I want to read the rest of that quote
[1:40:13] but I want
[1:40:16] you know
[1:40:18] maybe I can can I redirect them
[1:40:21] it's hard
[1:40:24] and remember
[1:40:26] when you are praying for somebody else
[1:40:28] in that kind of a fix in that kind of a
[1:40:31] fix
[1:40:32] God will honor and heal you
[1:40:36] when you're praying for somebody else
[1:40:39] Lord I got needs in my life but probably
[1:40:42] throughout this building there's
[1:40:43] Witnesses
[1:40:44] every one of us that when we got our
[1:40:47] sight off of our problems
[1:40:49] and started praying about
[1:40:51] others
[1:40:54] you find your burdens lifted
[1:40:57] see that don't make sense to our mind in
[1:40:59] what makes sense to our mind is I've got
[1:41:00] all this before me this is what I need
[1:41:02] to be praying about praying about
[1:41:04] praying about and what happens we stay
[1:41:06] in our own world our own world our own
[1:41:07] world our own world our own world
[1:41:10] sure but you go to praying for others
[1:41:12] what is it it's the spirit
[1:41:14] Christ
[1:41:15] the life of the sacrifice
[1:41:19] being useful
[1:41:21] through you
[1:41:23] God will honor and heal you when you're
[1:41:25] praying for somebody else that's what
[1:41:27] Christianity is based on to help one
[1:41:29] another do for one another be kind to
[1:41:31] one another understanding to one another
[1:41:33] if you see your neighbor's mistake you
[1:41:36] see where they went wrong don't go wrong
[1:41:38] with them but just pray for them just
[1:41:41] keep praying and God will understand
[1:41:44] that he'll make everything right
[1:41:49] foreign
[1:41:56] let me come back to my point because I
[1:41:58] almost forgotten nobody reminded me
[1:41:59] about my mom
[1:42:02] my mom had some different different
[1:42:04] times where there's situations where she
[1:42:05] had a a lady that she worked with
[1:42:09] and this lady my mom could never
[1:42:11] understand
[1:42:13] you know the way that the lady would
[1:42:15] react and treat her and things you know
[1:42:17] and certain things he was passed over
[1:42:19] and
[1:42:21] and my mom you know one reason I know
[1:42:23] this is because it came out later on as
[1:42:25] testimony because I tell you and it
[1:42:27] ain't to lift them up because we no
[1:42:29] doubt her and my dad they probably had
[1:42:31] their discussions over coffee when
[1:42:33] I was snoozing it no doubt had their
[1:42:37] discussions about this in maybe in the
[1:42:39] back room and I don't know but I know
[1:42:41] the testimony of it and it's been
[1:42:43] something that's never left me because
[1:42:45] you couldn't figure out why that this
[1:42:47] why the person even would respond in the
[1:42:50] way that they would and one that my mom
[1:42:52] was a perfect person but you know what
[1:42:54] it come down to
[1:42:56] this woman
[1:42:57] she had been married multiple times
[1:43:00] it wasn't her
[1:43:02] it wasn't you understand me it wasn't
[1:43:03] her
[1:43:05] but it was a spirit upon her
[1:43:08] that caused her
[1:43:10] to be jealous
[1:43:12] it caused her to come and act in ways of
[1:43:15] malice and hatred
[1:43:18] but I'll tell you
[1:43:20] God gave Grace and my mom prayed for
[1:43:23] that person
[1:43:25] I can't remember all the rest of the
[1:43:27] testimony but God turned that
[1:43:28] relationship around
[1:43:31] and she was one right at dad's funeral
[1:43:33] wasn't she mom
[1:43:35] and she's also asked Mom even when she
[1:43:37] came there let's go out to lunch
[1:43:39] sometime
[1:43:41] and you look through all that and you
[1:43:42] might think
[1:43:44] go through that
[1:43:47] but there had to be something displayed
[1:43:49] to that that woman I don't know where
[1:43:51] she's at tonight
[1:43:53] I don't know where she's at
[1:43:55] my mom could have had everything in the
[1:43:57] world to act in a certain way and no
[1:43:59] doubt she felt her feelings trampled on
[1:44:01] you'll know what I'm talking about
[1:44:03] but you know what
[1:44:04] it's what resource you turn to
[1:44:07] it's God that gives us strength it's God
[1:44:09] that gives us the grace because through
[1:44:11] all those things he's molding us my
[1:44:13] point I'm saying within this it's a
[1:44:15] standard in our life
[1:44:17] don't take it personal
[1:44:19] don't take it personal
[1:44:21] you understand don't take it personal
[1:44:23] it's a standard in our life don't
[1:44:25] compromise just stand true and stand
[1:44:28] loyal to what you believe because Jesus
[1:44:31] said
[1:44:32] if I be lifted up
[1:44:34] I will draw all men unto me
[1:44:38] don't you love him
[1:44:40] Lord I need more grace
[1:44:43] Lord help me to help me to see and help
[1:44:45] me to operate in that way I don't preach
[1:44:47] these things because I'm already there
[1:44:49] and perfect I'm not preaching to a group
[1:44:50] of perfect people as far as in ourselves
[1:44:53] but I am believe I'm preaching to others
[1:44:55] who say Lord granted Lord in my life I
[1:44:58] want to be useful Lord help me Lord let
[1:45:00] that word let it rise in my life let my
[1:45:02] will be submitted to you let's pray
[1:45:05] father
[1:45:07] thank you tonight Lord for your mercy
[1:45:10] Lord even in the testimonies and things
[1:45:12] we've given
[1:45:13] Lord if there's anything that would be
[1:45:15] any highlight
[1:45:16] it's you
[1:45:18] that calls the Lord without you we're
[1:45:20] nothing
[1:45:21] and we can do nothing we need your
[1:45:23] strength we need your grace Lord
[1:45:26] and father like the simple examples
[1:45:28] you've given me to use of that of the
[1:45:31] microphone or screwdriver
[1:45:33] Lord we want to be so neutral help us to
[1:45:36] keep ourselves
[1:45:37] so neutral
[1:45:39] your Prophet said that's one of the key
[1:45:41] things in finding the will of God is to
[1:45:43] stay neutral
[1:45:45] help us Lord
[1:45:47] because we never know when decisions
[1:45:49] will be faced with them we never know
[1:45:51] Lord in a moment that you would want to
[1:45:53] use this we might just be going into
[1:45:55] Lord a medical place to have some sort
[1:45:57] of an exam or have something done and we
[1:46:00] think well I'm just going here today
[1:46:01] I've got this appointment at this in
[1:46:03] time or I've got this appointment to do
[1:46:05] this work for this person and that's all
[1:46:07] we know but God help us
[1:46:09] because we realize that we are here upon
[1:46:12] this Earth
[1:46:13] for a greater purpose
[1:46:15] we have our jobs we have our occupations
[1:46:17] we have the things the cares of this
[1:46:19] life that we have to attend to Lord
[1:46:21] but Lord Jesus may we always
[1:46:24] be available
[1:46:26] for you Lord to use uses help us to
[1:46:30] remain neutral Lord
[1:46:32] there's many things that can come our
[1:46:34] way to try to pull us out
[1:46:36] of being neutral
[1:46:38] many things the Lord
[1:46:40] but help us Lord we know that God we can
[1:46:43] never do this in our own strength but
[1:46:45] Lord in your presence as we're feeding
[1:46:48] on the word of God lord as we're just
[1:46:50] Lord praying and talking to you and I
[1:46:53] believe you told us Lord you've spoke to
[1:46:55] us and Lord many veterans here we
[1:46:57] realize that praying Lord is not just
[1:46:59] limited to a Time Lord in our our
[1:47:02] bedroom or a closet or Upon Our Knees
[1:47:04] but it's not really even the position of
[1:47:06] our body it's the prostration of our
[1:47:08] heart Lord God to the Lord that where we
[1:47:11] can even a prayer without ceasing when
[1:47:13] we're always Lord looking to you and
[1:47:15] talking to you is different Lord just
[1:47:17] maybe needs or even an expression of
[1:47:20] Love Lord that would go back to you
[1:47:22] help us Lord we realize that within all
[1:47:25] these things
[1:47:26] as we live in this world yet not of this
[1:47:29] world we want to walk with such a
[1:47:31] neutrality about our lives
[1:47:33] that the spirit of God is able to move
[1:47:36] down
[1:47:37] at any moment Lord and uses
[1:47:40] if there's one thing that took place in
[1:47:42] Memphis that day
[1:47:44] when that plane was grounded
[1:47:47] and Lord the prophet would come out of
[1:47:48] the hotel room that morning the next
[1:47:50] morning
[1:47:52] Lord God when we look at that and we say
[1:47:54] Lord oh I want to be led like that I
[1:47:56] believe we are I believe there's things
[1:47:58] Lord that we've overlooked many times in
[1:48:00] our own life you were showing us with
[1:48:02] that example through the messenger's
[1:48:05] life of just how yield and how neutral
[1:48:07] you want us to be to where you can move
[1:48:10] upon us for the simplest of things
[1:48:14] I think of how the prophet he didn't
[1:48:16] understand what was going on he didn't
[1:48:18] know what was taking place
[1:48:19] what I come to find out as I hear other
[1:48:21] places in the message how brother Brown
[1:48:23] was even talking how he would be in a
[1:48:25] meeting and he would be getting right
[1:48:26] across the street and the spirit of God
[1:48:27] said go back over across the street
[1:48:28] right there there's a man coming down
[1:48:30] the street with this color of suit on
[1:48:31] and this and this and this and eater and
[1:48:33] go and join yourself to this bus there's
[1:48:35] a woman here with a brown dress and this
[1:48:37] and this Lord it was to be it showed
[1:48:39] that was an example
[1:48:40] that was an example Lord
[1:48:43] not that we
[1:48:45] or to take brother branham's place no he
[1:48:47] had his spot in place it was necessary
[1:48:49] for the body but Lord he can't take our
[1:48:52] place either
[1:48:54] but he yielded himself Lord that a
[1:48:56] message could be brought you loving
[1:48:58] tonight
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:01] Hallelujah that's that's our desire if
[1:49:02] you would like to stand you're more than
[1:49:04] welcome to
[1:49:05] always say that because I know sometimes
[1:49:07] that some of you it's maybe hard to
[1:49:08] stand but you don't ever have to but if
[1:49:10] you want to feel like it
[1:49:12] but a useful life and Lord willing will
[1:49:15] pick it up and continue to look at some
[1:49:17] other parts to it I know it's awful
[1:49:19] simple but
[1:49:21] godness does nothing outside of man
[1:49:24] sometimes the things that we're praying
[1:49:26] about I don't know about you but there's
[1:49:28] many times I've prayed about things and
[1:49:29] we need the Holy Spirit to move is that
[1:49:31] right
[1:49:32] and many times as we're praying about it
[1:49:35] Lord we need you to move now I know God
[1:49:37] can move and speak to somebody by dream
[1:49:39] right God can speak in many different
[1:49:41] ways to hearts that
[1:49:43] but be surrendered God God knows how to
[1:49:45] get attention God knows how to speak
[1:49:49] but remember
[1:49:50] he does nothing outside
[1:49:53] of man
[1:49:54] he can visit that life speak to that
[1:49:56] life
[1:49:57] but it might be that God would have you
[1:49:59] and I praying in such a way
[1:50:02] to where that moves down in our heart
[1:50:06] to act out
[1:50:08] Redemption
[1:50:11] I've said this many times among young
[1:50:12] people because sometimes with young
[1:50:14] people they can they don't mean to I
[1:50:16] know there's sometimes
[1:50:18] different things that come up and stuff
[1:50:20] and sometimes in the ages and we're in
[1:50:22] and things like that and I remember all
[1:50:24] those feelings I remember those feelings
[1:50:26] where you enter a room and you almost
[1:50:27] feel like everybody's looking at you and
[1:50:30] now I don't have a choice when I go in
[1:50:33] the room you know you don't have a
[1:50:35] choice but it doesn't have the same
[1:50:37] matter that was a season of life I
[1:50:39] needed God's grace to get through that
[1:50:41] season right
[1:50:42] but sometimes you just take a month like
[1:50:44] amongst young people there can be this
[1:50:46] group here and this group here and this
[1:50:48] group here and there might be somebody
[1:50:50] else that would come in
[1:50:53] somebody's got to be a redeemer to step
[1:50:55] out of that group and say hey
[1:50:57] come on over here
[1:50:59] hey come on come over here come over
[1:51:01] here oh brother Samuel that's
[1:51:04] that's
[1:51:06] spiritual let me give you the word it's
[1:51:09] called acting like God
[1:51:11] it's a redeemer
[1:51:14] if that Redeemer anointing was upon him
[1:51:16] and it acted the way it did how much
[1:51:18] more upon you and I
[1:51:19] it's a redeemer anointing
