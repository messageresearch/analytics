speak with Lord those things that Lord that we would have need of Lord that would be of a great benefit in direction to our hearts in this moment Lord we love you and we praise your Lord just commit this service and your hands now the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you'd like to stand with me if we will stand and read in Acts chapter 11 and certainly want to greet each and every one of you that as you are gathered in your different places and certainly this is not an the ideal setting sometimes myself I've had to stream from home it's not the same as being here and but we're just looking in this time right here in a special time that the Holy Spirit will just you'll come right there where each and every one of us are at he'll minister right to our hearts he knows just exactly what we have need of and so we're just looking to him in this hour we want to go to Acts chapter 11 and I want to read just a few verses of Scripture and then we will let you we'll let you be seated in Acts chapter 11 and verse 27 and in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch and there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world that dearth meaning famine and which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the Brethren which dwelt in Judea which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and saw may God bless you and as you're being seated and bless the reading of the word you know we I mentioned to as a congregation on Tuesday just just praying about this and just kind of already feeling this direction even heading into last weekend that if it came about that we were something where they narrow the time that we could actually or the number of people that could meet they haven't forced anybody to do anything like that but I I just really felt to comply with that even as people would it would be a sight for people to drive by here that are in quarantine and they drive by the church and see a field parking lot here that I feel would be very disrespectful you know that we we just want to be able to comply I want to be very clear on this as I said to the church on Tuesday this is not persecution we are not facing persecution the scripture that we are we are looking at here tonight I want to just speak a little thought and perhaps go begin into this on God's provision in trouble sometimes and to see that we in our lives we will see upon places in the scripture that God God is not we understand the author of confusion but God has everything right under control he's directing everything and so with within this when we we look at it we find that there are times there's never been anything that was laid in the scripture that that we would not experience suffering but rather we do experience suffering the scripture would say all that live godly in christ will suffer persecution we also suffer in terms of sickness at times we suffer in terms of loss many different things we could go through we're not exempt from that but God has given us a provision that when suffering does come that we are able to endure and to make it through that of the suffering so here we find a setting in the scripture where the the Church there in Judea there in Jerusalem there the Spirit of the Lord has come upon a prophet by the name of agamous but the Branham was clear to tell us that he said this was not the gift of prophecy he said AG Abbas was truly a prophet the Spirit of the Lord was there to speak and to think of God's provision you know God did not have to give this warning to the church and whatsoever God did not even have to express this but you see God is is already he gives sight to his church even though there are things that you know that we did not have anything of this nature or the name spelled out for us but yet we know that within the scriptures that there are things that are already hitting the earth have been hitting the earth there are plagues that have already begin to be poured out when but the RAM will talk about that of influence or was already poured out because of the rejection of the Holy Ghost and yet we we realized that within this in these things that God makes a provision that you and I can have a rest and have a comfort that he has everything under control and so when we we look at it it's not a time of persecution that we are in we're not facing that we want to be I want to be very clear because I believe with all my heart is to live in a time of balance and we're to take our encouragement from the Word of God there's undoubted that the scriptures that maybe that I would read tonight or even others could read in oncoming services but the difference in this hour where the Holy Spirit has anointed our eyes for the Church of the Living God we're not just looking to make it through we are anticipation of the coming of the Lord the rapture the change of our bodies that's where our expectation is at so when we look at this setting of the scripture this was a great famine that was taking place during the days of Claudius Caesar this was prior to the besieging of Jerusalem that was spoken there that would take place by Titus and AD 70 which remember there was not one elect child of God that was caught inside Jerusalem in that besiegement they had received the word of the Lord they were able to look into the prophecy and to think they were alerted in that hour in that moment that they were not caught inside of Jerusalem so the same God is the same God who moved here on behalf of this mean it's the same God that's moving on behalf of our need even here tonight and you know when we we read these scriptures in acts 11 there are some key scriptures that are are given prior to this reading that would take place in the book of Acts and and one thing that I want us to we are I believe we're mindful of it but sometimes we can get away from it and that is Peter has made it very clear in the the the very first part of this chapter that it was the leadership of the Holy Ghost that directed him to take the gospel to the house of Cornelius he's bringing it down that there was God's timing to unlock the door to the Gentiles into that of the gospel where that the Holy Ghost would fall on the Gentiles that were gathered there in the house of Cornelius through their tenderness and receptiveness to the revealed word of the hour where Christ Jesus Christ was revealed from word to flesh he revealed himself by his power through his word and he came upon the elect subjects that he had redeemed it was God who had moved I want you just to think of this this is where a part that I'll be dealing with it God moved upon Cornelius his heart and Cornelius is praying and seeking after the Lord and God is dealing with Peter's heart at the same time remember God is not going to use an angel God's agency is man so God is going to use that agency of man and it will be God because remember it would God coming down and and moving through the his own the body that he created for redemption that God would actually redeem you and I'm and now through the Holy Spirit he committed the word of reconciliation to where that Peter was just a vessel in the hands of God to deliver the word that was to be Express pokken there to the house of Cornelius so this is the thing that happened in this time Cornelius and them were looking for leadership and there was a leadership of the Holy Spirit to direct them into the word for that hour and God always knows God is the one who lines everything up and the whole thing that we'll look at just for a few moments God gets everything in position so we understand this when we look at these scriptures when I I read this part we read for a text where I I look at is the first part of it it clearly gives us to where even then leadership of the Holy Spirit on the timing of wind to go to the Gentiles when to deliver the word and I'll say that the true Church of the Living God is no different is to be no different we are under and to be under the leadership of the Holy Spirit we are not to be dominated by the thoughts and the feelings and the fears of man we are we are not had to be as you know this the the poem would say dumb driven cattle we are to be under the unction of the Holy Ghost in this hour let me just say it very personal we don't take our leadership from any news agency our leadership the pressure of what we do it is to come from the Holy Spirit he's the one to direct you and I he's the one that directs us into the comfort of the promises that he is the one that supplies all of our need and to recognize that even as you know the the disciples would be scattered here and you know there was the persecution where they were scattered of Jerusalem and you know that persecution it had to happen in order to get them out of the boundaries and get the word into the places where it had to go so God also notice he also is aware this dearth this famine is going to come upon the land so God is bringing a word to them in Antioch and in Cyrene and and Venus and all those places God's bringing a word to them there are Jews that are gathered there and a word is being delivered to them of the visitation of where they have looked for the coming of the Messiah and they have looked for the outpouring of the holy spirit now here comes the word to bring deliverance to these Jews that are gathered in these places did all the Jews receive it they did not there were many that stood against it but nonetheless there were there were ordained Jews that were elected to life that were to receive it and as they received it in Antioch remember Paul gathered there as the Bible said a year with them and as they gathered there together then came the news what we read in our text where there was a famine that struck the land and just as God had ministered to the needs in the lives of those who were in Antioch by God depositing of his life giving of his word that would lead those people into a real union and relationship with Almighty God they also would have natural necessities that when the need arose they were able to minister you see the body is under the leadership of the Holy Spirit he is still Jehovah Jireh tonight he is the Lord that provided for himself and if I could say it like this you know it is not for us to be anxious or to be worried you know in this hour I I want you to understand this we are to be a people that change should be even more prayerful than we've ever been before it ought to bring us to be more sincere than we've ever been before in all that we ought to become even more deliberate and intentional in our prayer life in everything because remember it is God that is providing for you and I in this hour the same God that's provided for us all along it has not been our reasoning that has provided for us it has not been our hands it has been God that has directed us and God provides for himself just for a pause just a moment and I won't dwell on this too much tonight but just for a little bit there is a greater this was a famine that was being spoken of here in the book of Acts that was a famine that affected all of Judea this affected there were believers gathered in Judea this was not the believers that were there in Judea when this famine came upon the earth they were not exempt from feeling the pressures of this famine they were not exist from suffering as others of this famine amid you said it personal they weren't exempt from going through the grocery store and not seeing certain cans of food are you with me we see as the bride of Jesus Christ it does not give us a pass from suffering it does not give us a pass but in the midst of this time if we can allow it God will draw us nigh he'll draw us closer to him he'll mold and shape in her lives and make us more fit for the journey this is not a time that we're just you know waiting we'll i I wait til this pass let me just say it to you very clearly do not let our hopes be upon the fact of we're just gonna get back to normal their main dis there may be a new normal let our expectation remain steadfast on the Lord amen that's our comfort amen that's what we're looking to and so there's a greater famine then than even that of a natural family that famine is going on in the land right now it's prophesied in the last day as it was in the Book of Amos of how that God would say I will send a famine in the land God said I'll sin that it will not be a famine for bread or water and truly up to this time let me just speak for our country for the most part in our country we've not had any walk for bread or water and let me just say very clearly in our country we've not had to experience the things that our brothers and sisters have already been experiencing just even a few years back when you know I'll just maybe even last year even when brother you know brother Stephen aballay had contacted me and different ones resources were being committed because the brothers and sisters that were there they didn't even have rice you see these experiences these are things that sometimes we and I've saved this very graciously we become so tunnel vision with things let me tell you they're already experiencing those even brothers and sister in years past in Russia they had to wait in line for bread and wait in line for these things these are not things that are new to them and I just you know I just speak from my heart just of these things that we are we are in in the midst of this time that we see a famine that's in the land that's far greater than in than anything of a want of food I really don't believe there's anybody even with the stores being bare here and there I don't believe there's anybody really that's in want of food but to think of it there's a greater famine and that's a famine for the hearing of the words of the Lord and the Bible talks about the condition they'll wonder from sea to sea they'll go from north to east a run and they'll seek for the word of the Lord and they shall not find it remember them remember the famine will be in the hearing well I'll tell you blessed are you who can hear and that he that hath an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches it's a time of operation it's a time to be ready it's a time like the Lord spoke to us even last Thursday be ready as brother Jerry stood here in minister be watchful and in that scripture that portion of 1st Thessalonians 5 he read if you'll notice the word sober is mentioned multiple times which means to be calm collected temperent in one's mind the wonder so this there's a greater famine that's going on you see it in people's lives they go to church but they still live in the world they're still up and down in there all let me get personal here you can hear the prophet every day of your life but if you don't have the Holy Ghost your life is still unstable you'll be wandering to and fro you've got to have the token you must have the Holy Ghost when you have the Holy Ghost he's the one that takes that word and your life is no longer life of famine but he reveals himself to you it's a must in this hour it's a time to be checking up it's a time for every heart in every life to really be checking up to be sure glory be to God the Bible would speak of this moment here in the book of Acts it would talk about Stephen you know his ministering about the dearth the famine that encompassed all the land of Egypt and Canaan and great afflictions and it says our fathers found no sustenance but when Jacob heard there was corn in Egypt he sent out our fathers first now remember when Abram left when he came into the land he left the land in the beginning of Genesis 12 he left the land because there was a famine he went down to Egypt God never told him to go there is that right God never told him to go there you remember that it was even in times where he returns and 13 that the land itself does not look so good and it's even recalled that the land is barren they're having problems with the flocks and the herdsmen of lot in that of Abraham where they're not finding the sustenance is that right there comes up a separation lot looks and sees the well-watered Plains of Sodom and he leaves the side of Abraham and he goes and pitches his tent toward Sodom eventually we find out what happened Sodom overtook his life he would it would a play it would have been a place of safety for lot to remain under the guidance and direction of Abraham but instead not separating himself not removed any protection that he had around his life but yet Abraham standing there as a believer that even when lot was taken captive Abraham looked in it as though lot lot belong to me God gave me the land he belongs to me so Abraham had power because he was separated and he went and he overtook Kings and brought him back now within this this this famine then we couldn't you know go into that of how that even where God would direct Abraham in a time where Abraham would would go out in Genesis 21 into the south country and it would be what we know as career and God would meet you know we know what Abraham did there you know once again he said Sarah you knows my sister but God after all of that had come about God met Abraham there and remember God revealed himself to Abraham right there and in wells that he dug Abraham dug wells for fellowship he dug wells for Union and God revealed himself there in the world that Abraham dug and remembered there were seven ewe lambs that were offered out there and it that well of bear Shiba which is that of the well of the Sevenfold covenant and then the Bible would tell us that even after this when in Genesis 26 when a when there became a famine in the land of Canaan and Isaac himself left and he went and journey toward arere and God told him come to a place that I will show you and I want you to abide there you see Abraham Isaac the scripture tells us he he prospered there in the Bible said he brought forth a hundredfold but it was something more than just his natural sustenance that God was wanting to do with for Isaac he was wanting to let Isaac know that I am the God of your father Abraham and the god who made the covenant with Abraham and the god who called out your father and I'm the God who will see you through he made himself personal to Isaac and when you read in the latter part of that scripture there's a change after that revelation at the well of Beersheba to where a hamlet he comes there a Babel it says hey we now see that the Lord is with you they recognized god had revealed himself there was a famine it got Isaac in position that God might reveal himself personally to Isaac and reveal his covenant and so God God has a way of taking situations and this is where as believers we have we we want to be sensitive and sure they're things that comes up that's not real comfortable for us there's things sometimes that come but we we don't want to be complainers we want we want to look and sometimes even if you're praying about something and you're praying in a certain way like as mentioned here on Tuesday night I was praying in a manner because I knew with with our boys and you know they were the oldest two are in college and they have labs that they've got to do and and in those classes they meet you know and and I just you know looking at that and I know that they they really it was more than than just college it was about being in that lab and being able to interact with that teacher and so we were praying in that manner and then you know I didn't make a big long thing of it but on Sunday night you know I I mentioned to them and I just kind of dropped in my heart I said you know we're gonna we need to pray differently because I realized how we were praying then and I'll just say like this how I wanted that for them because I knew what benefit how they were looking at that I wanted that for them but God began to move on my heart and I said Lord would now would you direct us help us through this time and we don't know what all is going to come out throughout this time but I'm asking you for your wisdom through this time and there's things that I could share with you that God has certainly made some wonderful provisions that we would have never even dreamed of or thought of and we still wish to have to apply ourselves we still have to trust the Lord but I just think that through it all sometimes which would be natural for us we want to pray and ask God to move maybe in this way but remember God he answers every prayer sometimes the way that the answer comes as maybe not the way that we're praying for it but the greatest thing we can do is say Lord here's my hand take my hand and lead me Lord through this time so God he knows what he's doing when he this word you know Joseph comes into a place of power he comes into a place of authority but remember it's it's the interpreting of the word that has now come to that of Pharaoh by that of a dream there was no other way for Joseph to come out to come forth but now think of how God would have it everything is in his time of how that you know the chief Butler you know when he was told and when Joseph interpreted both those dreams he said hey don't forget me remember me but yet you find it was a glog period of time before the chief buffer but Butler remember but you see a one time for Joseph to be remembered Belinda came a time when Pharaoh had a dream then in that time it was planned now to bring Joseph in position God allows circumstances to rise to get his people in position and this is exactly where the scripture would speak I love this very much in the scripture this did this whole allotment of Scripture is that ties in with Israel prophetically I love it very much and we find that how that the land of Egypt the Bible says in Genesis 41:55 that the land of Egypt was famine and when the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians go unto Joseph and what he says to you do we understand that scripturally no man cometh unto the father but by me in man there's a name there is only one name that is given we're bad men might be saved and that is through the name of Jesus Christ so to recognize they're in our midst of a famine there is one place that we can go to one that we can go to and this famine covered over all the earth the Bible says that all the countries in verse 57 came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all the lands now I want you to think the scripture would say of all the lands and just like our scripture where it says that there was an in our text a great dearth that covered the world the world meaning the inhabited earth at that time all of this famine had struck that of the inhabited earth and noticed all the countries and and Jacob and them they are not exempt from it God has provided for them in the land but you see God is moving behind the scenes and bringing his people into position is that right now let me just let me just say this we understand that the bride of Jesus Christ is not put in position by national force there's want to lay that very clear but the bride of Jesus Christ God puts the people in the bride by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so but yet God will lead us in position sometimes even if I could say it like this even when we are in position in Christ God God will allow situations God will allow things to arise that calls us to evaluate and reflect on our life and on our walk and this is a time I believe let me just say this to you and I I say it too even as parents this is not a time to be idle you say I'm at home but don't be idle because I dle idle leads to idolatry you then that's exactly what the scripture I can't do what's that tonight but you see all of this times I I'm looking at things all around people are trying to give the kids give the kids something to do give the kids something to do to occupy but as believers we have a scriptural pattern when it speaks when all of this was taken place in the land of Egypt the family got together it's a time to be energized in the promise of God when Jacob he heard the Bible said when Jacob heard that there was corn down in Egypt Jacob spoke to his boys he spoke to his sons and he told them go down there in verse two of Genesis 42 and buy from us fence that we may live and not die now think of this verse for Benjamin's not let go right now this is only the gathering there as they're coming back on eagle's wings but Benjamin's gonna be there at the right time come on somebody Benjamin's gonna be there too right and that notice here it's because everything's got to be in its right position when brother Branham was getting ready to go down into there to Israel remember the Holy Spirit said no this is not this is not the time that's not you that's not you see God holding in position because remember it is the revealing of himself by his power where the fountain is open in the house of David that brings us ceiling to the 144,000 making them ready for his physical visitation and unfolding to them so how God has everything lined up because everything must be in position I love this scripture Genesis 42 verse 5 says and the sons of Israel came you say who was coming to get who was coming to receive oil who was coming to receive substance who was coming to receive life it was the sons of Israel who lizard in this hour that comes for life the sons of Almighty God the sons and daughters of God the sons returning to the Living God there's a word that has come out to call us back to the original sacrifice and the sons of the Living God turning to the original sacrifice the original baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah the sons of Israel came glory be to God and Joseph looked at him and he remembered his dream he remembered his dream how God unfolded mercy in that hour they got in position you know the Bible also goes into this there was a there was a young men two sons one of the boys he had it he here he is just like the other he had an inheritance but for him he wanted to go out and live a righteous life I don't want I don't want father I don't want none to do with this just give me what belongs to me and let me go you see everything he was worried about he wasn't worried about his daddy Betty had you gonna make him fine here what about my part of the land who's gonna help see nothing about his decision was about anybody else but himself men shall be lovers of themselves you see that's the heart of the serpent nature it's a lover of self that's why he had to take one who was willing to come dance end in humility and give his life willingly for you and I that you and I might received that new birth that would deliver us from that old nature that is all about self and self will and self desires and advance within a heart a desire to please Almighty God and yet even each and every day we battle with that self even yet still that is out here even in these mortal bodies the things be to God overcoming power the word gives us strength we are not in famine the word gives us strength to bring it in subjection but there arose when this young young man was out there there owes a famine God allowed a condition to arise that would cause him to start thinking about home he begin to get hungry hallelujah you know God knows exactly he knows exactly where to get those that belong to him sometimes were playing for so many blessings that God said I'm trying to get him back home and you're wanting me to bless him treats brother Samuel there's a mighty famine in the land and notice but Bible talks about here he was he was eating he he would he would have even ate the same stuff that the pigs were eating but he didn't even have a chance to eat that look how low his diet had become his diet had become so low to where here he was willing to eat that of the pigs and yet he could not even have that portion he began the Bible said he said I perish with hunger he knew he was hungry and he knew there's only one place I can go I've gotta get back to father's house for father's house for his prayer let me tell you something whether you're here or whether you're on the internet you might be away from father's house and there is nothing in the world that will ever satisfy that longing you've gotta get the father's house and become a part of eternal life for only oh Jesus cries is their satisfaction hallelujah this is a time of preparation amen is a time to take that unleavened bread it's a time to take that bread of his life the Scriptures tell us another account in the Book of Ruth here I love this in the days of the judges the Bible said there came a famine in the land of Israel and so there was the man of Bethlehem Judah notice the famine came in the land of promise they weren't exempt that's why we realized as as a believer as a child of God there's no such thing as a painted up picture up or you'll never have no more problems you'll never have no more stress you'll never have no more tension the Prophet tells us when you become a Christian you add tension to your life but the tension you add is constantly it's a blessing am i pleasing to my lord there was a famine in the land see God is working to get them in position why he knows over here in this country of Moab is one of my daughters so God would take a whole family and move a whole family right there because of one that's the same God he'd removed Philip from the revival that was going on in Samaria and brought him down there for one Jesus in John 6 for one went by the well Jesus don't need a big old list like he's serving up some big old buffet banquet catered dinner he only needs one hungry heart brother and he'll my hungry heart he'll provide in that little room you'll come back with your ass he'll come back where you're setting up he is always when he hungry he is invited and said Lord fill me Lord you know it's a blessing to be hungry Jesus tells us that in John in Luke chapter 6 it's a blessing to be hungry because if you're hungry that means you're not full it's those that are full right now that itself is judgment because the before right now leaves Leeds 200s later when there's a need for a reality and need for a living God it's better right now to be hungry and become fool than to be fool and be hungry that's what Jesus would say it is better to mourn now and then become joyful than to be joyful and now lead to morning amen because this world the reality of it wants that one what's that other the reality of that other land moves into our heart brother it's our deliverance it brings the joy of that land into our hearts they came into that country of Moab now watch this in verse 6 the Bible says then talking about Naomi her husband died what her sons died all that she has is her and her daughter-in-laws what I want you to see is through the midst of this look at Jacobs attitude look at the slums attitude look at how that even when they come they're even Jacob's sons when they come there and begin to speak with Joseph you'll find of how that there would even be Judah that would step forward in that hour you'll find how they would lay their lives on the line where Judah said my life in behalf of this lad let Benjamin go I put my life there on that hand think of it this is what I'm looking at is even the condition of their hearts they had now they were actually being relieved of themselves I'm telling you when you see right now many of you know how it is we see all sorts of things right now even right now the spirit that has already been pervading the wall is even heightening during the midst of this time such foolishness that people take and pull a paper out of one people's part and out of somebody's hands such foolishness and nonsense but it shows the reality of a people that are so in love with themselves oh god I don't want to be here during that tribulation time hallelujah I want to be under the blood and be sealed away because I lay in rapture it ain't just about that I'm not wanting to be here I want to be what he's at and if he ain't here I don't want to be here anyway he's not welcome I'm not welcome anywhere this wired this message is my welcome I'm not welcome anywhere had the Holy Ghost is not welcome I'm not welcome hallelujah then she rolls with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread the very important spot verse seven so now she's heard that bread that the Lord notice that the Lord had given his people bread she hears about this now what's what she does where for she went forth out of the place where she was you seem to tell you something everyone whether you listening whether you here we are chargeable before God when you know there's a living reality that deals with your heart that lets you know you can be free it lets you know there is a bread that can give you strength to live an overcoming life you are obligated once you hear the word to Pumbaa word receive it and go into action in humility and reverence she went out of the place that she was in which they say something God ain't gonna drag nobody guarding dragging nobody to the altar God ain't gonna drag nobody in rapture it's all about yielding and they went on here home they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah we find how they came they came back Ruth oh or you know or fuh she went on her way she went on back she went back you know she she did not see anything in it for her at all Oh forth obviously needed was a little bit of discouragement and offer with a little bit of discouragement okay I'll go on back you see it was a discouragement but that discouragement itself it encouraged her just to go ahead and go on her way but for Ruth oh ma I think I'll build around tells us in the Holy Ghost series he said Ruth had a vision Ruth saw and Ruth was standing there steadfast she said don't you entreat me to return back to my people you see this gospel that came to the Jews and when the Jews family remember in the turning it down after every one of them were sealed and it turned unto the Gentiles there remember as it turned to the Gentiles of we who had no promises North in the covenants or the Commonwealth of Israel but all what joy that it has brought to our hearts no wonder Paul would write in the book of Romans he said lot lot eat Gentiles praise she the Lord Saint God for His mercy to you and I truly truly Amen they that would love Israel love the Lord God's not lost control this is why you know brother branham would say it like this and I'm coming down here on this he would mention to us he said in in the in the scripture that is written there to the lady you'll see an age these things saith the Amen these things saith the faithful and true witness and brother band said it like this let me just read this tree he says oftentimes we talk about the great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became a great and personable impersonal God it is as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then through the death of Christ has atone for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God just as Bay said it's just as though top folded his arms and stood back it's as if we majored in believing in a Great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation now I say this is how many people think but that is wrong thinking for God is governing in the affairs of men right now he is both creator and sustainer for by him we're all things created amen he is before all things and by him all things consist the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully execute the will of the Father his very existence and this are these are personal words to us his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them his eye is ever upon them well he said I'm so glad that my God abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he's true to the word he'll back it up he's true he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day I am glad that I'm resting in his faithfulness let me just bring it to this place as we read in our scriptures there in acts 11 those believers when that would come that there is a dearth there is a famine they didn't know how long that family was going to last they didn't know how many years it didn't speak that but according to history because they said even in the scripture in the days of Claudius Caesar it was about to force her into his reign sort of been 45 ad but they didn't know how long that this was going to last but you see there was a comfort that they were drawn from it wasn't that they didn't feel the pressures it wasn't that you know fear wouldn't have tried to come around and try to grip but you see there was a rest there was a comfort through the word of the Lord I would say it like this they were already given to the Lord but I think some things no doubt kind of even turned up and they became even more deliberate I tell you through this time right here I I don't know I really don't know what you know hasn't has in store I don't know how things oh I don't know how things are unfold I know they've said you know 15 days but I'm not not worried about that in us as I speak to our congregation that's not what I'm worried about but my my heart has always been were my concern more than 15 days my concern is that every soul be found ready under the blood I'd rather every soul be found ready to go before the Holy Ghost to take this opportunity and this time oh god if you dive you know you don't have the Holy Ghost we can tell it's made real in your life say God fill me with the Holy Ghost don't occupy and then don't occupy yourself with the things of the world but what the world's trying to do during this time maybe one day Allah will give you a marathon and movies will do this for free we'll let you have this for free we'll let you have this for free the trend to put anesthesia in the minds of the people to take the minds of a what they need to be considering these are judgments these are plagues that are being poured out and these are temporary minor things could pertaining to what's going to come it's a time to get ready it's a time to be sure there's a time to gather the family together it's a time to make sure you're under the blood it's a time to evaluate your life God have I been playing around have I taken coming to church for granite have I made little excuses here and there yeah I was preaching from my heart tonight it's a time to evaluate because as the Prophet told us in feast of the trumpets he said one of these days these will become fond memories let me just clarify this very clearly I'm looking according to how the word and how the Prophet brought it to us you say what what is that he said I don't see one more thing left to happen but they're chrome but the going of the church in the rapture every day we are living for the change but saying I'm waiting on this and I'm waiting on that you're waiting on the wrong thing it's to be looking to the coming of the Lord as the prophets asked the question and I read I mentioned it to you they're not will the church suffer persecution 1964 questions and answers locked the early church did he said knows her the bride goes in rapture sure we might there might be this or that here and there but you understand what I'm saying they're people that are waiting on events to take place waiting on this to happen waiting on that to happen those are not promises that were to be looking at we have a promise and what does a real promise do it creates expectation and we ought to be expected to meet our loved ones then to meet him in the air so this is the admonition as I believe that leave us with here tonight this is what Jesus and I believe that those saints of God I believe this is what where they stood jesus said when he was here standing in a body of flesh seeking not what you shall eat or what you shall drink neither be you of a doubtful mind doubtful means like driven on on a sea of time with ways does it say me what should I do should I should I should I take a circuit around time or maybe I ought to go to this club or maybe I ought to go through this store I'm gonna let me just tell you give me something better just pray ask God to direct you ask God to direct you say lord help me lead me to the place you know what I have need of for all these things look what this for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that she have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom I think of the example brother Branham would tell over and over because what was spoke right here in the Book of Luke Jesus spoke that in Matthew Matthew recorded the same way too it was speaking in deliverance of anxiety we're living in a time where the scripture said men's hearts would be failing for fear we're living in that hour it's been ongoing but we're seeing it more and more and we even see even how people and and I'm not you understand I feel sorry for the people I wish that I could speak to them I had a had a Mandy and just yes yesterday I think at the house replacing something in security-wise for us and the only thing I did you know he'd mentioned to me and we've had good conversations over the past years when he's taking care of things for me and I you know he told me he said yeah he said I you know he said I he said we've got he said I believe we've got plenty of food there at the house he said you know I went to eight different stores the other day and I told him I said well that you know just a little testimony I said my wife and I said when we had to go out and get what was on our list I said when we had looked it up at Walmart they didn't have it I said that what we did I said I didn't know what I was going to experience when I went out and said but I just said lord help us guide us and I said you know what God helped us to get it wasn't and never is anything extravagant but God helped us to get the very simplest of things he provided for what we had need of I'm very thankful for that because that's that's how I've always known him to be he's provided for us it has not been Sam Walton or anybody else that's provided for us hadn't been Sam's Club Costco or whatever more they weren't provided for us God has provided and I don't mean this scripture is not making light of planning its not making light of planning but what it is saying is is don't become consumed with these things like the rest of the nations do don't become consumed and you know how you know you can tell when somebody's consumed talked to them a little bit and whatever they talk about the most it tells you what they're feeding on brother Samuel I can't help it then do you know what do this one thing take your phone and put it somewhere else get off your new sites and everything else because I'm telling you there's a lot of alarmist on there anyhow I'm sure I may be pastor a few alarmists to the things be to God for his deliverance we don't need that we don't we need the leadership of the Holy Ghost we need stability and this time our children need to it's not we're not putting on a show but our children if God Terry's friends we don't know how long that will be here but our children even in midst of times like this they need to see the gospel in flesh how do we face these times of adversity how do we face it do we drift or do we say god I'm gonna just become more deliberate God just taking ahold of the Lord but the RAM tells a story you tell it in the message paradox he'll tell it in a message absolutely you're familiar with it as as message believers about the druggist during the time of the Great Depression he tells brother Branham where there was you know the lines were real long a doctor could rat out a prescription but you had to go down to the county and the county would give you the money to pay what the doctor had ordered for you he didn't have time to go to the doctor his wife was expecting here she was she was very sick she would have to be she was gonna have to be delivered you know at any time very hard time he comes straight to the pharmacy the young man who's there which is the druggist son he says to him I can't do this right now you got to go and stand in line and go like the rest time we can't do this but the villa bream says the old druggist was a god-fearing man and he overheard it and something caused him say wait wait wait wait wait wait wait son let me see the prescription see this is where I look at this how the Holy Spirit would direct me to this year as I'm just studying here and looking at things today to see that the old druggist was still set aside enough where the Holy Spirit couldn't move upon him in this time of the Great Depression where people were lined up to get he was not where he was although for Londoners I'm all stressed out I'm all tense now my mother he was still separated enough that the Holy Spirit couldn't move him like he moves Simeon the Holy Spirit could move him to say let me see the prescription he could still be moved with compassion and he filled that prescription and when he went to put that prescription in the hand of that man but the band said that drug is told him he said when I seen the hand I went to put the medicine in it was a nail scars in that hand nail scars in that hand and this was the very thing that that druggist that he made mention in that time he said brother Branham since then Christ has been more to me because of doing that for that woman he saw that that is in as much as you done unto the least of these you're done unto me we don't know that even in the midst of this town I think as brother Richard gave the prayer request even there on Tuesday night that in the midst of this time let us be sensitive even when we're in the store when we're around the family's another place you don't know the opportunity it can be a time there might be a protocol that's in a time of famine and they're longing for bread they're in a time of fear and they need deliverance amen they need help they need guidance they need leadership let us not be so occupied with where we can get the next package of chicken the next package of hamburger let us be occupied and say God let me be set aside like that druggist was because that time of depression was a whole lot worse many many many many many much more than what you and I are facing but he was set aside and I really mean this with all my heart I've told people before if you can't handle Facebook get off of it and how to say it very plainly to the whole congregation if you can't handle the stuff get off of it and let God let God just become more real to you during this time let our experience deeper you know brother branham ends and what I just read to you out of the message absolute he says I'm not gonna call for an altar call he said I'm gonna make a consecration call right now instead right after he mentioned that about the druggist he said we want to consecrate ourselves to this absolute he said I've consecrated myself and I want to consecrate myself a new to this absolute of Jesus Christ I think that's a great moment in this time where we see taking place God moving for our lives and our needs and this time God becomes will become more dear to our hearts whether you hear whether you're out on the internet if you don't know the Lord in a personal way if you if you've never accepted him as your Savior this is a good time it's a good time to settle that make peace with God we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ it's a good time to repent it's a good time if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not out of fear but because you recognize I'm not where I need to be and if you've not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a time to say God let the determination of your grace come upon me Lord God because you won't pull me through a pipe or push me through the let me Lord lead me to a place of total surrender may we take this opportunity may we allow the Holy Spirit to build his kingdom into our lives I know I'm speaking maybe to many that are just even outside of our assembly but I just just speak to all of our hearts we're not to be governed by fear amen the Holy Spirit is not he not given us a spirit of fear but a power of a science on mind amen let's just bow our heads father more tonight we have come and we've gathered here Lord under these circumstances Lord and your God out of respect and we've Lord to move upon this and we we thank you that you've given us an opportunity that we're able to be able to minister to the body of Jesus Christ we're thankful Lord and we pray tonight that God that you would forgive us Lord your God vini mind or any fault Lord or any heart or any life whether they're gathered here gathered Lord over the stream that Lord sometimes the the things that we hear and lord I you know like right now we hear certain things and this is gonna be and that's gonna be and they're looking at doing this Oh God it's not that we want to walk around and be ignorant but I believe God you've given us Lord a direction in this hour I'm just thankful I see it as your mercy and grace that we realize Lord is the people of God are AHA's have been anointed with our self God you've sent eyes into the body in this hour the eyes the Lord has moved God that revelation that message taken hold Lord for the mind of Christ setting down in the body Lord we don't want to use our mind or our thoughts we want your mind help us in this hour Lord I know I'm speaking to some that even operate they they're not working from home as a nurses they can't do that but there are out there right among patients they're out there right on the front lines lord I pray for them that you would watch over them as you watch over each and every one of us Lord we're asking God for your protection we're asking God for your leadership in the midst of this time Lord as we can see you you're working it even governing right now you're over every situation we see this Lord of these pestilence as diseases Lord we know it to be Lord demon powers at work Lord God but father you've not lost control you're in control and Lord how thankful we are there's a place of safety that we can rest in Lord from my heart I pray tonight let there not be one outside of that safety zone of Jesus Christ Father let there not be one dear God that would allow a thought Lord to isolate to him but may it be dear God from their heart say Lord this is a promise you made and I'm hungry I've been feeding on all sorts of things and I'm still empty I'm hungry and Lord you said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled that's my promise lord I pray tonight God may we each and every one Lord be in position may we be in position Lord even through the midst of this time may we draw near to you as you said drawn on to God he will draw nigh to you may we find ourselves the Lord even as we come together once again in on coming days Lord if how that you would make a way for us god I pray that father through the time and the evaluation Lord may it so strike our hearts they will not take any time for grant at any moment Lord if there's anything we're gonna invest in may we invest fully in the kingdom of God investing first of all Lord by giving of our own life completely holding nothing back Lord God being available to you father lord we just look to you now bless your people give them strength Lord in this hour encourage them Lord God may that may the Holy Spirit lure the Prince of Peace as we heard about on Sunday may you just encompass every one of their lives Lord may God there be lives and hearts I believe God there's things that you're doing even right now and we'll do even in the midst of this time Lord we pray that God may there be lives that had just just come to you that are turned over that really evaluate may there be hearts that set among us that really take a hold and say lord I need a deeper walk I need to be ready to go granite Lord we pray bless your people Lord watch over them as they go Lord they're different ways watch over Lord goddess and on the then they go to different places work and Lord some of them as I said and we have to go to the store other things watch over them God keep their hand upon them and Lord

wisdom in this hour helping lord where it's not easy decisions that they have before it's not easy decisions that they have to make and Lord we pray for him Lord as God as the Prophet well after he had talked about Lord where America had turned down the gospel of Jesus Christ in 1956 we find the Lord in the opening of the adoption Series in 1960 four years later his attention is directed to how the president looked weary under the pressure of oncoming war under the pressure and he led the congregation in prayer to pray for the president under that time god I think you this message you given us the character Lord God the spirit of this message Lord that it came in Lord it came to bring a balance Lord in our lives lord how we thank you Lord for such leadership in this hour what a peace it
