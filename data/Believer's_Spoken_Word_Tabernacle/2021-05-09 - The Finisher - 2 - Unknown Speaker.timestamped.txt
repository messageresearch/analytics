[35:02] god is so faithful so mindful
[35:06] each of our needs
[35:10] i just want to greet each and every one
[35:13] of you
[35:20] certainly certainly thankful for each
[35:22] and every one of you
[35:25] testimony stand
[35:28] thank think very much you know when we
[35:31] we look over
[35:33] proverbs 31 and
[35:36] uh i know that there's a there's a great
[35:38] spiritual application within there
[35:41] but you know it's it's just something
[35:43] about it that
[35:44] it's a beauty that god has placed within
[35:48] your heart as a mother something as a
[35:50] father and so forth
[35:51] it's an attribute that god put in there
[35:54] it's an attribute that in its own time
[35:57] in its own season
[35:59] it comes out and there's things that
[36:03] you just can never mother can never turn
[36:06] off
[36:07] nor can a father turn off it's there
[36:11] and just to see that
[36:14] that working you know and just how
[36:16] important it is you'll find
[36:18] through the scriptures and i know you're
[36:20] aware but you'll find in the scriptures
[36:22] where
[36:24] paul would speak to timothy
[36:27] he would you know admonish him
[36:29] remembering
[36:31] what was placed within his heart even
[36:34] from his grandmother
[36:35] eunice and his mother you know god has a
[36:39] way
[36:39] how god deals with hearts and lives even
[36:42] when you look at this
[36:44] you know you think of moses mother
[36:46] brother brown would say it in this way
[36:48] that how that god
[36:49] dealt with her heart that she knew that
[36:54] there's nothing could happen
[36:55] to that child brown said it like this he
[36:58] said that when
[36:59] moses was put there in that little
[37:01] basket and he said
[37:03] she was so certain god would keep his
[37:05] word to where she was standing
[37:08] waiting for pharaoh right at his steps
[37:11] to beckon knowing that god
[37:15] there's a promise that god has made
[37:19] no sometimes we look at things
[37:22] it's like when you think of mary willie
[37:26] will speak a little bit of her this
[37:27] morning
[37:28] but you know god
[37:32] would speak through his prophet to our
[37:34] hearts in this hour
[37:36] and he said and he would dramatize it
[37:38] and say
[37:39] as mary would speak back where the enemy
[37:42] was trying to come against her
[37:44] she would say my mother has planted
[37:48] the seed in my heart
[37:51] it takes god to come and quicken amen
[37:54] but the seed was planted
[37:56] [Music]
[37:58] and you know it's nothing that we
[38:01] we have done but it's all working in
[38:03] god's great economy
[38:06] so we just thank god for that this
[38:08] morning
[38:10] i also want to remember brother joshua
[38:13] spoke with him yesterday evening
[38:17] spoken on the phone he just wanted to
[38:19] say thank you for remembering him in
[38:20] prayer
[38:21] he's been dealing with a lot of
[38:25] pain and discomfort because he had the
[38:26] surgery there on his leg
[38:29] supposed to leave the hospital yesterday
[38:30] morning when the therapist and those
[38:33] had come in he was in just a lot of pain
[38:38] so they wanted to try to get all that
[38:40] under control
[38:42] and so lord willing he'll be discharged
[38:44] here on monday
[38:46] so we just had prayer and we want to
[38:48] just continue to remember our brother in
[38:49] prayer that god will just continue to
[38:51] move for him
[38:52] because the whole process is where
[38:55] he'll have a control on the outside of
[38:57] his leg to cause that leg
[39:01] to straighten out and come in line
[39:05] a lot of work one millimeter in the
[39:07] morning one millimeter midday
[39:09] one millimeter before he goes to bed he
[39:11] has to do all of that
[39:13] from the outside so that that femur bone
[39:16] the rod in there i'm just praying
[39:20] in this way god will take that body
[39:24] and cause it to receive that
[39:28] to become one to take that substance
[39:31] god will just bring that right down in
[39:33] life
[39:34] hey if god took a piece of wood and
[39:37] raised up an axe head
[39:38] yeah he's god
[39:43] he's gone amen so we just want to
[39:46] remember our brother in prayer
[39:49] let's just let's just look to him right
[39:51] now

[41:59] amen
[42:01] and god bless you this morning you'll
[42:03] turn with me
[42:05] in the scriptures to john chapter 19
[42:12] verse
[42:15] i'm 30. going to read just one verse of
[42:17] scripture and then we'll
[42:19] just let you have your seeds
[42:31] when jesus therefore had received the
[42:35] vinegar
[42:36] he said it is finished
[42:41] and he bowed his head and gave up
[42:44] the ghost it
[42:48] is finished
[42:51] all that was needed all
[42:55] that was to be fulfilled in order that
[42:59] redemption plan could go forward and
[43:02] come to completion
[43:03] he could stand at that moment and say
[43:06] it's finished
[43:09] that's the reality with everything in
[43:11] our lives in our hearts
[43:13] healing salvation deliverance
[43:17] the holy ghost it's a finished work
[43:22] it's already been for
[43:26] it's already all what has needed to be
[43:29] accomplished has been accomplished
[43:31] may god bless the word as you're being
[43:33] seated
[43:35] i just want to speak continue just for a
[43:38] few moments
[43:39] on that thought of the finisher
[43:44] and when we look here at this
[43:47] this very phrase that is uttered out
[43:50] from the very
[43:52] heart of the lord jesus here is the lamb
[43:54] of god that's
[43:55] offered up and not only was the body
[43:59] offered up that alone wouldn't bring
[44:02] redemption
[44:04] but but the soul being offered up
[44:07] he shall make his soul an offering for
[44:09] sin the body offered up so
[44:11] we not only would receive healing within
[44:15] our soul the spiritual part but we
[44:17] receive
[44:18] healing in our body it is finished and
[44:21] you know
[44:22] when that when that same
[44:25] voice that same reality rings in our
[44:28] heart
[44:29] that is where it comes into the heart of
[44:31] the art of the believer that the sin
[44:33] question then is set you're finished
[44:36] with sin
[44:38] finished with unbelief finished with the
[44:40] world
[44:41] it's finished and when we look at this
[44:44] and you think of where
[44:46] he is standing here in this moment and
[44:49] it's and
[44:50] the words it is finished
[44:53] i want you just to remember and let's
[44:55] look here just for a few moments of how
[44:57] that his life as he's as he's journeying
[45:00] on
[45:01] in the fulfillment of his word i want
[45:04] you to be very
[45:05] much aware of this this morning and much
[45:07] very
[45:08] intentional even starting here this
[45:10] morning that in each part
[45:12] of the life of the lord jesus and every
[45:17] other scriptural character
[45:20] in the bible and in your own life
[45:23] there was a purpose that was
[45:26] given by god it was not
[45:30] something that just at that moment was
[45:32] being spoken
[45:34] but it was god coming and
[45:37] god fulfilling what god thought
[45:41] and god spoke and god caught the
[45:43] prophets up into
[45:45] and they uttered or repeated what god
[45:48] spoke
[45:49] and now the word is coming into
[45:52] fulfillment
[45:53] so this this is an acting out
[45:56] of the word that has already been spoken
[46:00] and anytime god speaks it's finished
[46:05] when he said it is finished here it's
[46:08] now
[46:09] the fulfillment the manifestation of
[46:12] what was already thought and already
[46:14] spoken
[46:15] now it's been acted out but from
[46:18] the very inception right there
[46:22] when god spoke it it's finished
[46:25] there's nothing can detour nor
[46:28] change the course
[46:32] nothing jesus said in john 4 34
[46:37] my need is to do the will of him that
[46:40] sent me and to finish his
[46:43] work john 5 36
[46:47] i have a greater witness than that of
[46:49] john for the works
[46:50] which the father hath given me to finish
[46:54] the same works that i do bear witness to
[46:56] me
[46:57] that the father hath sent me
[47:01] i have glorified thee john 17 4 i have
[47:04] glorified thee on the earth
[47:06] i have finished the work which thou
[47:10] gavest me to do
[47:13] now there was a lot of other people on
[47:15] the earth and have lived on the earth
[47:18] that they've had their purpose but then
[47:21] not everybody's purpose
[47:23] is an eternal purpose some purposes
[47:26] like just raising up pharaoh pharaoh was
[47:29] raised up for a purpose
[47:32] in order that the glory of god
[47:35] might be made known because god would
[47:38] raise up a ruling power
[47:41] which knew not joseph
[47:44] in other words knew not the god of
[47:47] joseph
[47:48] whose heart would be hardened he served
[47:51] a purpose
[47:52] but pharaoh's purpose was not a purpose
[47:55] that was found on the right side of
[47:57] prophecy
[47:59] pharaoh's purpose was a purpose that
[48:01] would be
[48:02] against prophecy that would stand
[48:05] against the fulfillment of the word
[48:07] but it wasn't man fulfilling it it was
[48:10] god fulfilling the word amen
[48:14] and this is where the lord jesus is here
[48:17] he's declaring
[48:19] that the what what has been allotted for
[48:22] him to do
[48:24] him this is what he's focused on this is
[48:27] what he's given to
[48:29] this is what he even draws strength from
[48:32] in his life do you recognize that even
[48:35] in the fulfillment of the word
[48:37] he's actually as he says my meat is to
[48:40] do
[48:41] the will of him to send me the finish
[48:43] the word
[48:44] there is there is even a strengthening
[48:47] in finishing
[48:48] and serving the purpose of almighty god
[48:51] and so when we look at this we recognize
[48:54] that
[48:54] this is a very important part in this
[48:57] of what was prophesied and what was even
[49:01] there from the mind
[49:02] of god where the lamb would would suffer
[49:05] before the foundation of the world but
[49:07] if we could like a like a drama or
[49:10] let's say just like a lens that is that
[49:13] is set out before us and
[49:15] sometimes we can get so zeroed in and
[49:18] we're
[49:18] focused in and there's times for that
[49:21] and then there's times where
[49:22] the actual picture itself it's got to be
[49:25] pulled back the limbs
[49:27] in order to see everything else that's
[49:29] all around it
[49:30] and what's taking place and so when we
[49:33] would take this lens back
[49:35] here we move from from this uh very
[49:37] fulfillment
[49:38] to say it is finished we bring the
[49:41] prophetic
[49:41] lens of god's word back and we come into
[49:44] isaiah 9 and 6
[49:46] and i know this is not the first mention
[49:48] of it but we come to this part of it
[49:50] where it speaks unto us a child is born
[49:54] unto us a son is given and the
[49:56] government
[49:57] shall be upon his shoulder and his name
[50:00] shall be called wonderful counselor the
[50:03] mighty god
[50:04] the everlasting father the prince of
[50:07] peace
[50:08] of the increase of his government and
[50:10] peace
[50:11] there shall be no end upon the throne of
[50:14] david
[50:14] and upon his kingdom to order it and to
[50:16] establish it
[50:18] with judgment and with justice from
[50:20] henceforth
[50:21] even forever that's still going
[50:24] on amen let me just announce to the
[50:27] devil
[50:27] you can't stop right amen
[50:32] you can't stop it it's going on
[50:36] once the word the word's been spoken
[50:38] it's set in motion
[50:41] let every devil of hell rise up can't
[50:44] stop him
[50:46] are you hearing me notice the very last
[50:49] phrase
[50:50] the zeal of the lord of
[50:53] hosts we'll perform this
[50:57] amen does god use actors he
[51:00] does but he doesn't use their strength
[51:06] it's god performing his word
[51:10] it's the zeal of the lord of the host
[51:13] when you consider how they were looking
[51:16] and waiting for the messiah
[51:18] let me just tell you something that was
[51:20] god that put that in their heart
[51:23] that was god that already a seed was so
[51:27] there and that word was pulsating
[51:30] in their heart of waiting for the coming
[51:33] of the messiah because
[51:35] they knew when the messiah comes
[51:38] there not only would be an offering up
[51:40] but there was another promise
[51:42] that was connected to the coming of the
[51:45] messiah
[51:46] and that was the outpouring out the holy
[51:50] ghost
[51:50] [Applause]
[51:52] the zeal of the lord of hosts will
[51:55] perform this
[51:56] isaiah 7 14 therefore
[51:59] the lord himself shall give you
[52:03] a sign behold a virgin
[52:06] shall conceive and bear a son
[52:09] and shall call his name emmanuel
[52:13] very important the lord himself amen
[52:18] amen this is him amen completely
[52:21] hill if it's part even one percent
[52:26] or even nine tenths of a percent it's
[52:28] not the fulfillment of that verse
[52:32] but the fulfillment of it the lord
[52:34] himself
[52:36] without the instrumentality
[52:39] or the aiding of man god
[52:43] doesn't need your help
[52:47] he doesn't need my help
[52:50] he he's the one who spoke his word
[52:54] all he needs is for believers
[52:57] to believe it
[53:01] so as we zoom back zoom back from your
[53:04] life
[53:05] and you recognize how that god
[53:09] in this myth brother branham would say
[53:10] it like this and proving his word
[53:13] he caused the virgin to conceive
[53:17] to prove his word god caused the virgin
[53:20] to conceive in order to prove his word
[53:24] mary was already ordained but god
[53:28] calls her to conceive in order to prove
[53:32] his word
[53:33] god doesn't prove his word through
[53:35] debates
[53:37] are you hearing me that still calls the
[53:39] word into question
[53:42] god don't prove it by debates he don't
[53:45] prove it through arguments
[53:46] god proves his word through
[53:50] believers the bible says
[53:53] prove all things and hold fast
[53:56] to that which is good amen
[54:00] to prove it is to receive
[54:03] god's vindication god coming
[54:07] and god proving his word
[54:10] by making it alive by making it real
[54:13] and then in order to hold fast to that
[54:16] you have to turn loose of everything
[54:18] else
[54:19] [Music]
[54:20] god knows how to bring us to that
[54:22] because there's things that we
[54:24] have as human beings as a safety blanket
[54:27] yeah right come on now linus ain't just
[54:31] a character in charlie brown there's a
[54:33] lot of linuses they got
[54:34] safety blankets but you see all god
[54:39] all god has to do is come back one of
[54:41] his children
[54:42] and when his word is being vindicated
[54:45] there is
[54:46] a power within that word that reaches
[54:49] beyond our understanding to turn loose
[54:53] of things that we thought were absolutes
[54:56] and we release them for a true absolute
[55:00] that lays hold upon our lives
[55:04] you see as we come back even a little
[55:06] more
[55:07] i want you to think about what we just
[55:09] read with isaiah
[55:13] never never has
[55:17] this ever been done upon the earth where
[55:21] a virgin
[55:21] shall conceive amen
[55:26] never has this taken place you have to
[55:29] trace this clear on back
[55:30] even to the very first creation
[55:34] of man but god didn't use a woman then
[55:39] are you with me god didn't borrow a womb
[55:42] all right but you see in order to do
[55:45] away with
[55:46] the very curse of the serpent and that
[55:50] first
[55:51] birth that first birth is
[55:54] condemnation are you with me
[55:58] in order to undo that that's why the
[56:01] question
[56:01] should resonate in your heart why did it
[56:04] have to be a virgin birth
[56:08] why did it have to be an act that was
[56:11] separate
[56:12] from man and woman why did it have to
[56:16] be that way so that our real
[56:19] true birth would not be tied
[56:22] to a man to a woman to a system to an
[56:26] organization but there's nobody else and
[56:29] no other place
[56:30] that we can rest upon but upon god
[56:33] and to stand there and say i am a son of
[56:36] god
[56:37] i am a daughter of god i have been born
[56:40] of god i've been born again
[56:44] [Music]
[56:47] imagine isaiah the brown would say it
[56:49] like this think of this
[56:52] the embarrassment when he heard god say
[56:56] i'll give him a super sign isaiah
[56:58] embarrass me
[57:01] because a prophet he's here he is caught
[57:05] up into a realm
[57:07] and what he's going to speak god's
[57:08] already spoke
[57:10] so he's caught up into that ramp and god
[57:13] moves him beyond his senses and he
[57:16] speaks a word
[57:17] i think this is very fitting he speaks a
[57:20] word
[57:20] that is beyond sensible realms
[57:24] and what that prophet and that prophet
[57:27] himself
[57:28] says was embarrassed but he knowed
[57:31] god would keep his word he would prove
[57:33] it there was a part of him
[57:35] that was embarrassed but there was a
[57:37] part of him
[57:38] that believed it the part that was
[57:41] embarrassed
[57:42] was not a believer he could never ever
[57:45] believe but the part on the inside that
[57:48] was a believer
[57:49] that said though this is impossible
[57:53] but god has said it and god will keep
[57:56] his word
[57:57] amen
[57:58] [Applause]
[58:01] thank god for isaiah god had to have
[58:04] isaiah
[58:05] on the scene but remember isaiah
[58:08] was not a superhuman what was it
[58:12] he was in his position at that moment
[58:16] surrendered to god to sp to speak
[58:20] things that were declared to be
[58:23] impossible
[58:25] isaiah how would you look at this group
[58:28] of people
[58:29] to believe in this hour for the
[58:32] impossible
[58:33] when the very atoms and molecules
[58:36] of your body are going to be changed
[58:41] when the rapture were the sweet of the
[58:44] holy spirit
[58:45] coming over the earth let me just drop
[58:47] this here just for a moment do you
[58:50] understand
[58:51] when you look down through you see all
[58:53] these things that they're making a lot
[58:54] of
[58:55] really detailed issues about all these
[58:57] ufo sightings
[58:58] there's been more in the first part of
[59:01] this year
[59:02] throughout you know what that is that
[59:04] ain't foreign intelligence
[59:06] those are investigating angels
[59:10] those are lights in the heavens the same
[59:13] angels that went down into sodom to
[59:16] investigate it
[59:17] for judgment it's the same lights
[59:23] now there's things i know they're trying
[59:25] to talk it away oh this is sleeping
[59:27] underneath our radar oh this is doing
[59:29] this
[59:29] but let me just tell you what the
[59:30] prophet said one of these days
[59:33] one of those lights are going to drop
[59:34] down and pick you up
[59:36] [Applause]
[59:40] we're living in the hour of a
[59:44] fulfillment
[59:46] to say that to the rest of the world let
[59:48] me just say this
[59:49] even among christians and i use the term
[59:53] loosely
[59:53] you can almost consider a kook a lunatic
[59:57] and not because you believe in a
[1:00:00] transforming work
[1:00:01] of almighty god you know why you believe
[1:00:03] that because you've already
[1:00:05] experienced the change of your soul
[1:00:08] you've already experienced a
[1:00:10] supernatural spiritual
[1:00:12] resurrection and you're standing in a
[1:00:15] double portion
[1:00:16] not only for the spiritual resurrection
[1:00:19] there
[1:00:19] shall be a physical resurrection
[1:00:23] this is the hour of grace grace the hour
[1:00:26] of the
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:00:35] glory to god generations pass
[1:00:42] talk about how the families
[1:00:46] would buy the children their daughters
[1:00:50] every hebrew kind of they were looking
[1:00:52] for it
[1:00:54] you know is my daughter going to be the
[1:00:56] one
[1:00:57] is my daughter going to be the one i say
[1:01:00] what an awesome expectation
[1:01:03] i mean what what more could a you could
[1:01:05] preach a real family service on this
[1:01:07] what kind of an expectation of where
[1:01:09] this should be
[1:01:10] it's ultimate cultivating expectations
[1:01:13] in the world
[1:01:15] is it okay right if it's not i'm going
[1:01:17] to preach anyhow
[1:01:19] sometimes we we appreciate other things
[1:01:22] we want to see maybe our children to be
[1:01:24] successful this
[1:01:25] but i've said this over and over and i
[1:01:27] mean with all my heart i don't care if
[1:01:29] they were pushing
[1:01:30] i don't want to really see them that
[1:01:31] they're pushing a broom but i would
[1:01:33] rather their soul
[1:01:34] be so filled with the holy ghost god let
[1:01:38] it be that that's the expectation
[1:01:40] that i set before beyond any career
[1:01:43] beyond anything else i
[1:01:44] don't want them to depend on their own
[1:01:47] efforts i want them to know
[1:01:50] god
[1:01:57] isaiah spoke this word it circled
[1:02:00] it circled the earth it kept going
[1:02:04] hundreds of years hundreds of years till
[1:02:07] finally
[1:02:08] the time got just right and here
[1:02:12] upon the earth here was
[1:02:15] the vessel that god was going to use
[1:02:22] god was watching over mary's life
[1:02:25] for a whole time let me just say this
[1:02:28] her mother anna when she had conceived
[1:02:32] mary god was watching over that
[1:02:38] there was a part that she had to play
[1:02:41] let me just say this there wasn't enough
[1:02:43] devils in hell that could take
[1:02:45] mary out
[1:02:53] so here comes a time in her life
[1:02:57] 18 years old here she is
[1:03:01] she's espoused to joseph
[1:03:07] god has everything right in his time
[1:03:11] knowing that this must be first
[1:03:15] and here the angel gabriel
[1:03:18] he comes to a certain city see god's
[1:03:21] specific
[1:03:22] god is not a general god amen
[1:03:25] right somebody in here has a headache
[1:03:28] who
[1:03:29] it great but god when he sends a word
[1:03:34] he's got your address on it amen when
[1:03:36] god sends a word
[1:03:38] he knows your name god knows exactly the
[1:03:41] heart
[1:03:41] god's very specific he sent the angel
[1:03:45] gabriel with the word of the lord to the
[1:03:48] city
[1:03:48] of nazareth to a virgin that was
[1:03:51] espoused
[1:03:52] to a man by the name of joseph who was
[1:03:55] of the lineage of david
[1:03:57] look at all the specifics that had to be
[1:04:00] in line
[1:04:02] amen but god had it that all the
[1:04:05] specifics of where they
[1:04:06] had to be he would all be in line
[1:04:10] at the right time amen
[1:04:13] and he lets mary know thou art highly
[1:04:16] favored
[1:04:16] of the lord amen the lord is with me
[1:04:20] even when mary was a young girl the lord
[1:04:23] was with her
[1:04:26] god watched over the whole time no doubt
[1:04:29] she felt a lot of
[1:04:30] temptations and a lot of pulls and a lot
[1:04:32] of pressures
[1:04:33] and she had a lot of things come her way
[1:04:35] no doubt maybe she had
[1:04:37] different offers and other things that
[1:04:39] would come her way
[1:04:40] but there was a part about it you see
[1:04:43] god
[1:04:43] gave grace that she might be reserved
[1:04:47] to the part that god had for her to
[1:04:49] serve let me just tell you
[1:04:51] let's pan let's zoom in a little bit god
[1:04:54] has watched over
[1:04:55] your life god has made sure
[1:04:59] that nothing can take your life not even
[1:05:02] your own despair
[1:05:04] of your own life could hinder god from
[1:05:07] working
[1:05:09] when you feel like there's no use no use
[1:05:12] in going on
[1:05:13] but god because he's got an appointment
[1:05:16] for you
[1:05:17] grace is given for your life
[1:05:21] and let mary you're here because god
[1:05:25] made a promise in his word
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:34] wonder like mary america said huh
[1:05:37] now i see why there were things in my
[1:05:39] life certain roadblocks were put here
[1:05:42] and
[1:05:42] certain guidance was put here all those
[1:05:45] things god was orchestrating
[1:05:48] for this moment amen she goes let me
[1:05:51] just try to move upon this
[1:05:53] and zoom back out from this coming from
[1:05:55] it is finished on the cross
[1:05:57] and here you see her coming on a monday
[1:05:59] morning
[1:06:00] and here she is going to the well normal
[1:06:02] pattern
[1:06:04] and here the angel here the light
[1:06:06] appears
[1:06:07] and in that and in that light here the
[1:06:10] form
[1:06:10] of an angel comes forth it's gabriel and
[1:06:14] gabriel speaks to her in verse 30
[1:06:16] of luke 1. fear not mary for thou hast
[1:06:19] found
[1:06:20] favor with god amen
[1:06:24] what did she do was it because
[1:06:28] she read the scrolls and she prayed she
[1:06:31] did that
[1:06:32] but favor was given before
[1:06:35] any had done good or evil
[1:06:40] the favor of god is not something that
[1:06:43] is merited nor is it deserved
[1:06:46] the favor of god is god unfolding
[1:06:50] himself to his children in that season
[1:06:54] and that hour
[1:07:02] man i'm highly favored i'm out of the
[1:07:06] city and city nazareth hey there's a
[1:07:09] there's a lot of cities that's bad
[1:07:12] cities all around but just like in every
[1:07:14] city there's good and bad yes
[1:07:16] are you with me but nazareth didn't have
[1:07:19] a good reputation
[1:07:20] come on you don't have to look too deep
[1:07:22] in your family tree it didn't have a
[1:07:24] good reputation
[1:07:27] but god wasn't calling you based on your
[1:07:29] family tree
[1:07:30] because god don't want to see that tree
[1:07:33] blossom
[1:07:34] he wants the tree of life to blossom
[1:07:37] in your life
[1:07:41] he wants to graft you into that real
[1:07:44] reality by an experience to where you're
[1:07:46] no longer bringing forth the fruits
[1:07:49] of this earth of this world of that
[1:07:51] first birth
[1:07:52] but your life it bears the fruit of that
[1:07:55] new birth
[1:07:56] of that tree of which you really are a
[1:07:59] part of
[1:08:01] the lord i want you to listen these
[1:08:03] words
[1:08:04] i know you're familiar with them but
[1:08:06] behold
[1:08:07] thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[1:08:11] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:08:14] name jesus
[1:08:15] shall is not maybe are you hearing me
[1:08:19] shall is not maybe blessed are they
[1:08:22] who do hunger and thirst after
[1:08:25] righteousness for they
[1:08:26] shall be healed shall is not maybe
[1:08:31] shall is in his church
[1:08:36] when when it's time for the word
[1:08:40] to be fulfilled the word that it would
[1:08:43] be fulfilled
[1:08:44] in the hearts of the subjects that are
[1:08:47] intended
[1:08:48] for that word to be expressed through
[1:08:50] there's got to be
[1:08:52] a certain sound that comes through the
[1:08:55] word
[1:08:55] and the word itself gives a sound that
[1:08:58] reads in the heart
[1:08:59] of the believer a certainty that they
[1:09:02] can stand upon
[1:09:06] supernatural experience notice he shall
[1:09:09] be great
[1:09:11] and shall be called the son of the
[1:09:12] highest the lord god shall give unto him
[1:09:14] the throne of his father david he shall
[1:09:16] reign over the house of jacob
[1:09:18] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:09:20] be no end amen
[1:09:22] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[1:09:24] this be seeing that i know not a man
[1:09:28] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[1:09:32] and the power of the highest shall
[1:09:36] overshadow thee
[1:09:39] no questions it's certain
[1:09:42] amen it's a time when the word is to be
[1:09:46] fulfilled it's a time where darkness
[1:09:49] might have obscured it
[1:09:50] but question marks are over it presuming
[1:09:54] about it
[1:09:55] maybe it means this way look over to
[1:09:57] this commentary
[1:09:58] maybe it means this but there comes a
[1:10:00] time
[1:10:01] when now it's god who wrote it
[1:10:04] who supersedes commentaries little bits
[1:10:07] of inspiration that can come off of it
[1:10:10] and now it comes a time where god says
[1:10:13] this is my word amen
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:21] therefore the holy thing which shall be
[1:10:23] born of thee shall be called the son of
[1:10:25] god
[1:10:26] notice how he draws her attention to her
[1:10:29] cousin elizabeth
[1:10:31] now she's known about elizabeth
[1:10:34] elizabeth
[1:10:35] who was also called baron
[1:10:39] that wasn't a real quality term to be
[1:10:42] used in that time
[1:10:43] that's right to be known as his barren
[1:10:45] remember hannah prayed
[1:10:47] that that reproach would be taken away
[1:10:50] is that right
[1:10:51] now notice how god comes with the word
[1:10:54] already letting her know
[1:10:56] six months ago there's been an event
[1:10:58] take place
[1:11:00] and you've known about zechariah's and
[1:11:03] elizabeth
[1:11:04] but she is with child
[1:11:07] and he makes a statement to her for with
[1:11:10] god
[1:11:11] nothing shall be impossible amen
[1:11:14] amen what's he doing what is all this
[1:11:17] that's going on
[1:11:18] he's causing her to look at the word
[1:11:22] he's causing her to look away from her
[1:11:25] own self
[1:11:27] he's letting he's controlling her focus
[1:11:30] to i'm the god
[1:11:32] who keeps my word i'm the god
[1:11:35] who who specializes in the impossible
[1:11:41] you can never face nothing in life
[1:11:43] that's right if you get your eyes on
[1:11:45] anything except god
[1:11:47] you can you can't do it you get pulled
[1:11:50] right into it you trying to put it
[1:11:52] together
[1:11:52] you trying to straighten it out you
[1:11:54] trying to do this and you know what
[1:11:55] happens
[1:11:55] you only get frustrated god don't need
[1:11:58] your help
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:03] he don't need my help he is the one
[1:12:06] who comes and fulfills his word
[1:12:10] oh god help us notice what she says
[1:12:13] behold the handmaid of the lord she just
[1:12:17] presents herself
[1:12:19] behold the handmaid here is the vessel
[1:12:22] here
[1:12:22] is the lyrics what is intended in this
[1:12:25] work behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:12:27] be it unto me according to thy
[1:12:30] word notice mary is coming into a place
[1:12:34] within the drama and in in this right
[1:12:37] here
[1:12:38] it's a word position
[1:12:42] so being that it's a word position she
[1:12:45] can only be brought in position
[1:12:47] in the word by the word
[1:12:50] so then where she's standing is upon the
[1:12:53] word
[1:12:54] now you see within it brother brown
[1:12:57] would make this statement i want you
[1:12:58] just to just to catch this
[1:13:01] mary knew it was going to
[1:13:05] because god had said so look at this
[1:13:08] just for a moment
[1:13:09] think of the promises that god has made
[1:13:12] for us
[1:13:14] they shall their hands on the sick and
[1:13:15] they shall recover
[1:13:17] is that right take him at his word
[1:13:20] don't doubt anything go right on
[1:13:23] believing
[1:13:24] it'll be all right god promised it
[1:13:27] god will perform it god watches over his
[1:13:30] word
[1:13:31] to keep it and to answer prayer
[1:13:34] amen it's just you see it comes down
[1:13:38] to the same way of a real genuine
[1:13:41] experience
[1:13:42] a real genuine experience with god is
[1:13:45] not based on
[1:13:46] any works it's not based on a sensation
[1:13:50] it's not even based on lights
[1:13:54] it's based on the word of god
[1:13:57] where you know in yourself
[1:14:00] that there has been a passing from death
[1:14:04] unto life so your faith is
[1:14:07] based in the word of god
[1:14:12] it's based on the sensation you're in
[1:14:13] trouble because a lot of times you don't
[1:14:15] feel god and you don't feel like a
[1:14:16] christian
[1:14:19] but your experience is not based on
[1:14:22] sensations
[1:14:23] and feelings it's based on the word of
[1:14:26] god
[1:14:26] you might have feelings there can be
[1:14:28] sensation but you cannot faith cannot
[1:14:31] rest on those things
[1:14:38] all of this when we come back this is
[1:14:41] god's doing
[1:14:42] let me just remind you the scripture in
[1:14:44] psalms 118
[1:14:45] 23 this is the lord's doing and it is
[1:14:49] marvelous in our eyes it's speaking of
[1:14:51] the whole work
[1:14:53] coming to pass here not only of the
[1:14:56] redemptive work of the lord jesus
[1:14:58] but now the outworking of this and the
[1:15:00] phil and the finishing up of this work
[1:15:03] in our lives let's look at this just for
[1:15:05] a moment
[1:15:06] the bible says in psalms 37 23 the steps
[1:15:10] of a
[1:15:11] good man what's a good man we need to
[1:15:15] know what a good man is
[1:15:18] what's a good man it's a righteous man
[1:15:23] amen it's one who believes in god that's
[1:15:25] a good man
[1:15:27] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:15:30] the lord
[1:15:32] and he delighteth in his way now
[1:15:35] let me just try it just trying to move
[1:15:37] into these pieces here let's look at
[1:15:38] another part
[1:15:39] that was taking place so brother samuel
[1:15:43] what's going on from the cross it is
[1:15:46] finished
[1:15:47] but when you come back you recognize
[1:15:49] there's all these other parts
[1:15:52] that are having to take place that are
[1:15:55] integral parts here is zacharias
[1:16:00] let me just say it like this zacharias
[1:16:03] as the scripture said
[1:16:04] it was a certain priest that the angel
[1:16:07] gabriel the same angel
[1:16:08] that visited mary that same angel came
[1:16:11] to zacharias
[1:16:12] what you think of this here is zachariah
[1:16:15] standing here for sake of time i'm not
[1:16:17] going to read it
[1:16:18] but here he is standing here his his his
[1:16:21] wife
[1:16:22] elizabeth first cousins with mary they
[1:16:25] are
[1:16:25] old and well stricken in age
[1:16:29] they've been praying for children
[1:16:34] i wonder if every devotional time
[1:16:37] they were praying they weren't
[1:16:41] every time that when he was no doubt in
[1:16:43] the temple he's offering up the prayers
[1:16:45] of others
[1:16:45] he's no doubt offering up that prayer oh
[1:16:48] god
[1:16:48] that you would bless our home lord with
[1:16:51] a child
[1:16:52] he's been praying this for years and
[1:16:55] years and years
[1:16:57] and years
[1:17:00] you think there one time said that the
[1:17:02] devil didn't try to whisper in his ear
[1:17:04] and say
[1:17:05] god doesn't care about you
[1:17:10] sure there was surely there were times
[1:17:13] and no doubt there might have been other
[1:17:15] barren ones
[1:17:16] who were in the community but them
[1:17:19] barrenness only lasted maybe a year
[1:17:21] or two years or five years or ten years
[1:17:25] their barrenness was not in the same
[1:17:27] time frame as god
[1:17:29] are you hearing me they've got a choice
[1:17:31] they can
[1:17:32] either count on god and complain and say
[1:17:35] god
[1:17:36] you want to answer it why don't you care
[1:17:39] but there's something within them that
[1:17:41] they keep
[1:17:43] praying they keep believing
[1:17:47] these aren't superhuman people these are
[1:17:50] believers
[1:17:51] that are encompassed about with
[1:17:54] infirmities
[1:17:55] they have to battle and cut through the
[1:17:58] darkness of discouragement
[1:18:00] just like you and i do
[1:18:03] they don't only see things but they had
[1:18:05] to stand there and cut through the eyes
[1:18:08] the lies of the devil that would try to
[1:18:10] whisper
[1:18:11] in their ears come on somebody he's that
[1:18:14] devil slip right up next to the prophet
[1:18:16] and what did he want to tell him when
[1:18:18] his child was dying
[1:18:20] he never told him well you know that god
[1:18:23] god didn't do this and god didn't do
[1:18:25] that but what he
[1:18:26] wanted to let him know was is he don't
[1:18:29] care about
[1:18:30] you you see you've got to know god cares
[1:18:35] about you
[1:18:37] that he loves you and burying enough
[1:18:40] devils out of hell
[1:18:41] that is able to stand on a promise when
[1:18:43] you operate by the love of god
[1:18:45] because love produces pain
[1:18:50] but when the prophet was standing there
[1:18:53] and he said i was about ready to say
[1:18:56] if that's the way it's going to be
[1:19:01] it had already come down and almost
[1:19:04] there was almost a conception
[1:19:07] in the mind he was getting ready
[1:19:10] to come out but there was a greater
[1:19:13] revelation there was a greater power
[1:19:17] over the inside what was it god gave
[1:19:19] grace
[1:19:20] this was part of the fulfillment part of
[1:19:23] that position
[1:19:24] brother let me tell you something this
[1:19:26] is why there
[1:19:28] is nothing as great as the prevailing
[1:19:31] power of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:19:35] in your life
[1:19:36] amen hallelujah
[1:19:39] for even when you have trouble seeing
[1:19:41] yourself
[1:19:42] that doesn't alter what god thinks
[1:19:47] praise the lord
[1:19:52] god made a visit to zechariah here he is
[1:19:55] in the temple
[1:19:56] right now they were just and devout and
[1:19:59] you know they had a home that could
[1:20:01] invite god
[1:20:04] is that right but when sometimes when
[1:20:06] you read these things
[1:20:07] don't make it off as though it was their
[1:20:10] efforts
[1:20:11] that brought this to pass right it was
[1:20:14] god moving in their lives
[1:20:18] they were just in love with the lord let
[1:20:20] me tell you the secret of how
[1:20:22] that they got through all their times of
[1:20:23] discouragement because
[1:20:25] they were just giving themselves to the
[1:20:27] lord amen

[1:21:17] zacharias here the angel comes
[1:21:20] and he makes himself known to zephorize
[1:21:23] here's what he says in verse 13. i want
[1:21:25] to read this one
[1:21:26] fear not zacharias for thy prayer
[1:21:30] is heard
[1:21:37] how long they've been praying
[1:21:40] long time you got that right
[1:21:45] they wrote it so long song leader didn't
[1:21:46] even need it no more just knew
[1:21:50] are you hearing me what does this say to
[1:21:53] you and i
[1:21:53] don't ever give up on god's word
[1:21:57] if god's made a promise you stand on
[1:22:00] that
[1:22:01] promise because heaven and earth
[1:22:05] shall pass away but my word shall
[1:22:08] never fail you might feel inspired
[1:22:12] sometimes you're right and you might
[1:22:14] feel lower than dirt the other times
[1:22:16] it doesn't matter the word's not based
[1:22:19] on feelings
[1:22:29] lord tell me what i did was it that i
[1:22:31] read the right right scroll
[1:22:34] did i do it just right no it's my time
[1:22:38] amen it's my time
[1:22:42] you see the experiences of god are
[1:22:45] predestinated
[1:22:47] moments even when you receive the holy
[1:22:51] cause
[1:22:51] it wasn't just but i got to a place and
[1:22:54] it happened
[1:22:55] that was a predestinated moment
[1:22:58] from the hand of god
[1:23:02] whether he's in the church whether it's
[1:23:04] in a car whether you're at your home
[1:23:06] no matter where it's at it's a
[1:23:08] predestinated
[1:23:09] experience with god
[1:23:13] amen amen hallelujah
[1:23:17] that prayer is heard and thy wife
[1:23:20] elizabeth
[1:23:21] shall bear a son and thou
[1:23:25] shalt call his name john
[1:23:32] praise the lord boy boy
[1:23:37] i'm just trying to behave myself here
[1:23:41] zechariah asks the question whereby
[1:23:43] shall i know this
[1:23:48] i'm an old man my wife is well stricken
[1:23:51] in years
[1:23:53] let me just say this to you if we were
[1:23:56] putting zechariah and mary together
[1:23:59] zechariah probably knew more of the word
[1:24:01] as far as
[1:24:03] than mary did right zachariah he could
[1:24:06] only remember which he knew about
[1:24:08] sarah well stricken right hannah
[1:24:12] well stricken come on somebody yeah all
[1:24:15] of these
[1:24:16] conditions that were deemed impossible
[1:24:20] but there's a great difference in
[1:24:21] knowing the word
[1:24:23] amen glory and knowing the god of the
[1:24:26] word
[1:24:26] amen god used a woman
[1:24:31] who was not a priest was not trained in
[1:24:34] the temple
[1:24:35] but all it was it just took the word and
[1:24:38] for her
[1:24:38] to hear it and say how's this going to
[1:24:40] be because i don't know man
[1:24:42] and god laid out his word it'll be the
[1:24:45] holy ghost
[1:24:46] and what did she do she just presented
[1:24:49] herself
[1:24:49] behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:24:53] here's zacharias and he's asking what's
[1:24:56] going to take place
[1:24:58] i want to read this verse 19 i am
[1:25:00] gabriel that stand in the prince of god
[1:25:02] and am sent to speak unto thee and to
[1:25:04] show thee
[1:25:04] these glad tidings and behold thou
[1:25:08] shalt be dumb that means not able you
[1:25:09] know to speak or to hear and not and not
[1:25:11] be able to speak
[1:25:12] until the day that these things shall be
[1:25:15] performed
[1:25:17] because thou believeth not my words
[1:25:19] which shall
[1:25:20] be fulfilled in their season
[1:25:25] it didn't matter if zacharias he
[1:25:28] couldn't understand it
[1:25:29] it didn't even matter at that moment if
[1:25:32] he didn't believe it
[1:25:33] he had already prayed his prayer by pay
[1:25:36] has been in the presence of god and god
[1:25:39] said because you don't believe it right
[1:25:41] now
[1:25:41] you're going to be gone but i'm going to
[1:25:44] fulfill it
[1:25:45] anyhow
[1:25:48] let the world call us crazy let them say
[1:25:50] we lost your mind
[1:25:52] carries a
[1:25:56] let them say there's no real true
[1:25:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:01] there is a true holy ghost that brings a
[1:26:04] change
[1:26:07] let him say he don't heal the sick no
[1:26:09] more he's still healed for sin
[1:26:12] let him say he don't deliver he's still
[1:26:15] delivered
[1:26:16] he still casts out there he doesn't make
[1:26:19] any difference but about their own
[1:26:21] belief
[1:26:22] god rides right over the top
[1:26:36] when the devil said you'll never make it
[1:26:39] you'll never be a believer
[1:26:41] but god already saw you as a believer it
[1:26:43] didn't matter all your unbelief
[1:26:45] you didn't matter all yours excuses god
[1:26:48] made a promise
[1:26:49] to himself and god's word from that word
[1:26:53] to bring it to pass
[1:26:55] [Applause]
[1:27:01] it sounds like god's determined i'd say
[1:27:03] you're right
[1:27:08] god's determined and he's going to
[1:27:10] perform it amen
[1:27:12] when god spoke anything he performs it
[1:27:15] don't let these just statements just go
[1:27:16] by
[1:27:17] when god speaks it there's nothing can
[1:27:19] take god's word away
[1:27:20] amen when god speaks it all heaven
[1:27:23] records it
[1:27:23] it's got to happen no matter how funny
[1:27:26] it seems
[1:27:27] how unreasonable it seems it's going to
[1:27:30] happen
[1:27:31] anyhow amen
[1:27:38] so now here we have elizabeth here we
[1:27:40] have mary
[1:27:42] remember coming back from it is finished
[1:27:45] here they are boy you get two believers
[1:27:49] together got the same kind of experience
[1:27:51] [Laughter]
[1:27:53] look out man look out
[1:27:56] yes when mary here she is coming to
[1:28:00] elizabeth
[1:28:02] elizabeth sees her coming when mary
[1:28:05] greets her
[1:28:07] and expresses to her what has taken
[1:28:10] place in her life
[1:28:14] as mary rehearses that promise
[1:28:18] there's a reality in that rehearsal
[1:28:22] it's not just words it's a salutation
[1:28:26] where the very name of jesus
[1:28:30] is spoken elizabeth
[1:28:34] here she is that baby she hadn't felt no
[1:28:37] movement
[1:28:38] it's been six months
[1:28:42] and felt no movement but here when the
[1:28:45] salutation
[1:28:46] of mary comes think of this it couldn't
[1:28:49] happen in any other time
[1:28:52] god arranging things just in this very
[1:28:55] manner what was it that set mary in
[1:28:58] motion
[1:28:58] to go to elizabeth the word amen
[1:29:02] and now as she comes to this place and
[1:29:04] she expresses
[1:29:05] the working of the word in her life by
[1:29:08] the holy ghost
[1:29:09] what does it do it causes a dead baby
[1:29:12] to come to life hallelujah
[1:29:16] where there was questioning the baby is
[1:29:18] not moving
[1:29:19] now here the baby is brought to life
[1:29:23] she feels movement in the womb
[1:29:27] oh god let it be that hearts and lives
[1:29:30] feel
[1:29:31] movement in the womb amen
[1:29:36] and elizabeth makes this declaration i
[1:29:38] love this scripture and i
[1:29:39] luke 1 45 and blessed is she that
[1:29:42] believed
[1:29:43] for there shall be a performance of
[1:29:46] those things which were told her
[1:29:48] from the lord
[1:29:52] let me just say this i know these are
[1:29:55] simple statements but sometimes we get
[1:29:57] in the heat of the bible
[1:29:58] battle and we forget
[1:30:02] right i'm not condemning i'm preaching
[1:30:04] to every one of us
[1:30:06] we forget the simplicity
[1:30:09] god never is wrong
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:13] he's always right
[1:30:16] though you can't understand it believe
[1:30:19] it
[1:30:20] anyhow amen
[1:30:23] god is the one who interprets his word
[1:30:27] he interprets it by bringing it to pass
[1:30:29] to sincere
[1:30:30] and honest hearts if you're sincere and
[1:30:34] honest
[1:30:34] you got a question god god will come
[1:30:38] and he will answer that question
[1:30:43] think of this here here is joseph here's
[1:30:47] another
[1:30:48] part in this drama
[1:30:52] you see before what we read let's just
[1:30:55] move back up to our text before we could
[1:30:58] read what we read
[1:30:59] it is finished in our text each of these
[1:31:03] parts had to be fulfilled
[1:31:10] you can't go back and do somebody else's
[1:31:12] part it's the part of the word that
[1:31:15] we're called to fulfill it's the part of
[1:31:18] this hour this time this day our message
[1:31:22] where we're at right now and here is
[1:31:25] joseph a man that the scripture would
[1:31:28] speak
[1:31:29] is a just man he did not want it when he
[1:31:32] found this
[1:31:33] news from mary i like how brother
[1:31:36] branham would tell it because when you
[1:31:37] look here in the scripture
[1:31:39] you realize that joseph was also a man
[1:31:41] of integrity
[1:31:42] right she's 18 he's 45 years old
[1:31:46] quite a difference i mean that's kind of
[1:31:48] the parallel you look down through
[1:31:49] scriptures
[1:31:50] it was quite an age gap and all the way
[1:31:51] down through scriptures a lot of times
[1:31:52] between husbands and wives
[1:32:01] but here god has all this arranged
[1:32:04] at this time and here is joseph
[1:32:09] he has a question in his heart brother
[1:32:11] brown says mary would come to him
[1:32:13] and he could see in her
[1:32:17] an honesty and a sincerity
[1:32:21] he didn't see it at that moment
[1:32:25] he didn't even recognize he didn't know
[1:32:27] what was taking place
[1:32:30] he didn't even know if i can say it this
[1:32:32] way that he was
[1:32:34] part of the promise
[1:32:38] his name was not mentioned
[1:32:41] it was not said of how that would be
[1:32:45] of a husband but it would but here it
[1:32:47] was identified
[1:32:49] in that part of the world he didn't know
[1:32:52] that it was necessary that his life
[1:32:55] would be a shield for her life
[1:33:00] because if they have not been espoused
[1:33:02] already you see
[1:33:03] the timing of god is so precise
[1:33:06] if there hadn't been a spouse that had
[1:33:08] been no deliberation
[1:33:10] she'd have been taken out and stoned
[1:33:12] that's an unclean woman
[1:33:14] right man but god already had the basis
[1:33:18] covered
[1:33:20] can you imagine what joseph thought what
[1:33:23] have i
[1:33:24] got myself into
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:31] come on now there's times that you start
[1:33:33] second and question yourself
[1:33:35] amen right there's times when there's
[1:33:38] things in here
[1:33:38] you can receive and you you've got to
[1:33:40] settle peace on it you say you know
[1:33:42] i believe this is the will of god you're
[1:33:44] not inserting yourself
[1:33:45] but you really got a peace about it
[1:33:48] because the peace of god
[1:33:49] will always cut me the will of god but
[1:33:51] it's sometimes where it comes
[1:33:53] and your tribe when situations or
[1:33:56] conditions arise and you look at it and
[1:33:59] say
[1:34:00] what in the world is going on
[1:34:04] but god's perfection is not our
[1:34:07] perfection
[1:34:08] his perfection is the perfection of his
[1:34:12] life working and performing his work
[1:34:15] this was necessary
[1:34:21] and because joseph he stood there as a
[1:34:24] sincere
[1:34:25] man in an honest heart he thought about
[1:34:28] these things
[1:34:30] joseph just didn't check out after
[1:34:32] church
[1:34:34] he encrypted right he pondered
[1:34:38] he prayed about this god what is this i
[1:34:41] thought for sure
[1:34:42] i had your leading i thought for sure on
[1:34:44] this
[1:34:45] spouse i thought for sure i don't
[1:34:48] understand what's going on here
[1:34:50] right i don't know what's happening
[1:34:52] she's so sincere
[1:34:54] she's so honest let me tell you the
[1:34:55] story mary
[1:34:57] couldn't persuade i don't care how much
[1:35:01] that mary could quote the scripture and
[1:35:03] say this happened to me
[1:35:04] this happened to me this happened to me
[1:35:06] it took god
[1:35:08] to come and meet joseph
[1:35:13] amen individually why as a young person
[1:35:15] older person
[1:35:16] it takes an individual experience
[1:35:20] and meeting with god it can't be a
[1:35:24] mother's experience
[1:35:25] a dad's experience pastors experience
[1:35:28] prophet's experience you've got to have
[1:35:31] your own
[1:35:33] experience with jesus christ
[1:35:39] amen amen but the angel of the lord
[1:35:43] made a visit wasn't a prophet on the
[1:35:45] scene at the time
[1:35:47] so god visited by dream
[1:35:51] and god told him within it fear not to
[1:35:54] take
[1:35:54] unto thee mary thy wife
[1:35:58] he walks joseph all the way through the
[1:36:01] scriptures
[1:36:04] everything being done that it might be
[1:36:07] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[1:36:09] by the prophet think of this how
[1:36:12] that then joseph once he woke up out of
[1:36:15] that dream
[1:36:18] he was convinced amen he knew the angel
[1:36:21] of the lord had visited him amen
[1:36:24] he had questions when he went to sleep
[1:36:28] he woke up with answers
[1:36:31] amen oh glory be to god he did
[1:36:35] he wasn't he didn't answer them god put
[1:36:38] him to sleep
[1:36:39] and answered his questions
[1:36:42] that says a lot to you and me god
[1:36:45] doesn't need our intellect
[1:36:47] god only needs us to rest to relax
[1:36:50] to yield oh i'm gonna get the holy ghost
[1:36:53] i'm gonna get the holy ghost no you're
[1:36:55] not
[1:36:55] you need to rest and relax and say god
[1:36:59] come feel this tabernacle
[1:37:03] this is your word this is your promise
[1:37:10] it's not our efforts it's not our
[1:37:11] pressing it's not our struggling
[1:37:13] it's our yielding yeah
[1:37:17] my mind
[1:37:22] there comes time for john to be
[1:37:24] dedicated now
[1:37:26] when they come into the temple to
[1:37:28] dedicate john
[1:37:31] remember the custom is
[1:37:34] the calling after the daddy's name
[1:37:39] he can't hear and he can't speak
[1:37:42] but let me tell you something god keeps
[1:37:44] his word amen amen
[1:37:46] that boy wasn't gonna have no other name
[1:37:50] that's name was gonna be john the priest
[1:37:54] went to call his name
[1:37:55] zacharias and his mother spoke up not so
[1:37:59] right is that right then they they said
[1:38:02] well there ain't nobody in your family
[1:38:04] named john
[1:38:05] god ain't interested in continuing on
[1:38:07] our family
[1:38:08] genealogy the gospel ain't a family
[1:38:12] thing it's a god thing
[1:38:18] ain't nobody in your family name this
[1:38:19] way but god's doing a new thing
[1:38:22] amen amen
[1:38:26] so they motioned to zechariah you know
[1:38:28] the story they give zacharias a slate
[1:38:30] he begins to write on his name shall be
[1:38:33] called
[1:38:34] john and as soon as that name is called
[1:38:38] out
[1:38:38] they read it off of there god loosens
[1:38:41] his hearing
[1:38:42] god loosens his tongue and it begins to
[1:38:45] prophesy
[1:38:46] under that of the holy spirit you know
[1:38:48] what he begins to declare
[1:38:49] as soon as the holy ghost loosens his
[1:38:52] tongue
[1:38:52] oh my from a state where his ears
[1:38:55] couldn't heal
[1:38:56] and his tongue couldn't speak but as
[1:38:58] soon as the time
[1:38:59] and the moment of the word to be
[1:39:01] fulfilled his tongue is loose
[1:39:03] his ears are hearing and it comes open
[1:39:06] and it begins to identify
[1:39:07] this is the moment what the prophet says
[1:39:09] spoke up this is the time
[1:39:11] this is the hour this day the scripture
[1:39:13] is fulfilled
[1:39:14] this is a time where god has made
[1:39:16] promises promises
[1:39:18] but now is the time of god fulfilling
[1:39:21] his promise
[1:39:24] amen it was a time
[1:39:28] of fulfillment
[1:39:31] let me just say it like this when you
[1:39:34] look at this
[1:39:37] here comes that taxation these are all
[1:39:38] familiar things
[1:39:42] but now here comes time
[1:39:45] three months later for the lord jesus
[1:39:49] for his birth but it can't be born in
[1:39:52] nazareth
[1:39:54] that's right
[1:39:58] god allows he causes caesar to get an
[1:40:02] urge
[1:40:03] to tax the people
[1:40:11] sends them back and says you got to go
[1:40:13] back to your land
[1:40:15] of your nativity joseph
[1:40:18] oh it just happened to be no it wasn't
[1:40:20] it just happened to be
[1:40:22] it was ordained by god he was of the
[1:40:24] lineage of david
[1:40:26] he was from judea and it was going back
[1:40:29] to bethlehem true man are you with me
[1:40:33] i hope y'all you're with me on this
[1:40:35] sometimes there's things that happen in
[1:40:37] our life
[1:40:37] there's really two there's really almost
[1:40:39] two problems sometimes there's
[1:40:41] distractions
[1:40:43] distractions are things sometimes that
[1:40:45] we allow
[1:40:46] satan to distract us from the real
[1:40:49] purpose
[1:40:50] amen they aren't trials they're
[1:40:52] distractions
[1:40:54] and sometimes we can get caught up in
[1:40:55] those distractions
[1:40:58] are you with me and sometimes we'll call
[1:41:00] distractions oh i'm going through a
[1:41:01] trial
[1:41:02] no you're wrapped up in something that
[1:41:04] you got wrapped up in yeah
[1:41:06] it's not a trial you got distracted
[1:41:09] i'm gonna preach it anyhow then there
[1:41:12] are trials
[1:41:13] trials are predestinated appointments
[1:41:17] by god that he will take and really use
[1:41:21] to
[1:41:21] mold our character shape us and get us
[1:41:25] in position amen
[1:41:28] now distractions can be used
[1:41:31] when we learn from them all things
[1:41:34] work together for the good
[1:41:37] right not all things are good right
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:40] are you with me this is where as a
[1:41:43] believer
[1:41:44] where we're looking this is where even
[1:41:46] the monitoring the guiding
[1:41:47] and looking to the lord in our life
[1:41:50] i tell you yeah we're looking to the
[1:41:52] word brother if we're
[1:41:54] we're zeroed in on that word we don't
[1:41:57] have to be focused hard oh i don't want
[1:41:59] to be distracted i don't want to be
[1:42:00] distracted
[1:42:01] how can you be distracted when you're
[1:42:03] attracted
[1:42:05] are you hearing me now how can you be
[1:42:07] distracted when you're attracted
[1:42:09] but satan does his best to get us
[1:42:12] distracted
[1:42:14] this taxation
[1:42:19] they could have grumbled about it could
[1:42:21] have complained about it
[1:42:23] could have done all those things it'd
[1:42:24] been logical for human i mean which one
[1:42:26] of you would say hey i'll pay more taxes
[1:42:30] right not me buddy i don't want my hand
[1:42:32] up in here
[1:42:33] i'm not looking to pay more taxes it's
[1:42:36] not something you would look at
[1:42:39] but this is something that god is using
[1:42:41] to get them
[1:42:42] in position it's all in the plan of
[1:42:47] god sometimes you don't understand why
[1:42:50] certain doors
[1:42:52] have been shut it's god's ordained plan
[1:42:56] to get you in position god knows how to
[1:42:59] get his children's attention
[1:43:00] god can close things down he'll send
[1:43:03] detours
[1:43:04] he'll put everything in order to get his
[1:43:07] children
[1:43:08] in position where they need to be
[1:43:12] because his word can't fail god's made a
[1:43:15] promise and god performs
[1:43:18] the conditions had to be just right we
[1:43:21] wouldn't have looked at those conditions
[1:43:22] and said
[1:43:23] man them are they're more a premium
[1:43:25] condition no
[1:43:27] we would have said my goodness what a
[1:43:28] hardship what in the world is going on
[1:43:32] what in the world but if you'll notice
[1:43:35] every time when there's a fulfillment
[1:43:37] of the word it's when the conditions
[1:43:41] are the bleakest the darkest and the
[1:43:44] most
[1:43:46] opposite of what is called amen
[1:43:50] that's on design god designed that
[1:43:54] he can't make that happen but god allows
[1:43:57] that to happen
[1:43:57] man's choices as it comes into that
[1:44:00] place
[1:44:00] to come to that
[1:44:03] let me close with this
[1:44:07] here's a man by the name
[1:44:11] of simeon anna is there
[1:44:15] there's a handful of believers
[1:44:19] that's been waiting on the promise of
[1:44:22] god
[1:44:24] i didn't say there wasn't many jews
[1:44:25] there was many jews but jesus
[1:44:27] church when he came was a handful
[1:44:31] right that was really looking for him
[1:44:36] and the holy ghost visited simeon
[1:44:39] and he told him you're not going to die
[1:44:43] until i seen the lord's christ
[1:44:51] you know what simeon could walk he
[1:44:52] didn't want walking with arrogance
[1:44:54] but simeon knew he already has a
[1:44:57] believer he knew
[1:44:58] nothing can take me until god's
[1:45:02] finished right now
[1:45:05] right he didn't know before that time
[1:45:07] that his eyes was going to see
[1:45:08] the salvation of the lord but when that
[1:45:11] was spoken
[1:45:12] you think the devil didn't try to go to
[1:45:14] work on that
[1:45:15] you think the devil didn't try to send
[1:45:17] everything his way
[1:45:19] to try to deter let me tell you
[1:45:20] something when god speaks
[1:45:22] the devil comes against that to try to
[1:45:25] hinder that word
[1:45:27] dumb devil you've never been able to
[1:45:30] stop the word
[1:45:31] you'll never stop it you can't stop it
[1:45:34] when the word
[1:45:35] has been spoken it shall be
[1:45:38] fulfilled
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:42] there wasn't a sickness to take him
[1:45:45] off the earth until he had seen
[1:45:48] the lord's christ
[1:45:51] i don't care what they would have
[1:45:53] whispered to simeon simmons you better
[1:45:55] watch this
[1:45:55] hey you know you're an old fella now you
[1:45:58] better watch it it just takes one little
[1:46:00] sniffle buddy and you can be gone
[1:46:02] but simeon said but he said i'm not
[1:46:04] gonna die
[1:46:05] till i see the lord's christ
[1:46:10] give me a little bit of cough medicine
[1:46:12] but i shall not
[1:46:13] die can i see the lord's christ
[1:46:17] his faith was in the word and god's word
[1:46:21] can't be defeated
[1:46:29] until the purpose is served
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:34] and when the purpose is served when it's
[1:46:37] finished
[1:46:39] then god brings his children on home
[1:46:46] those that's gone on before in this age
[1:46:49] that we're living in
[1:46:52] we've got a promise there's not another
[1:46:55] message to come
[1:46:56] that's right true there's not another
[1:47:00] age
[1:47:01] there's not another messenger amen that
[1:47:04] part
[1:47:05] that part has been fulfilled amen
[1:47:09] god don't need it reenacted now it's
[1:47:13] time for the word that's been spoken
[1:47:15] by god through his servant in a
[1:47:17] certainty
[1:47:18] and put a certainty in our hearts this
[1:47:20] is our time
[1:47:24] this is your moment this is your time
[1:47:27] to where you can stand right there in
[1:47:29] the face of the devil and say
[1:47:30] you can't touch me right until god's
[1:47:33] finished amen
[1:47:44] sometimes we're so busy trying to get
[1:47:46] things you know trying to make it just
[1:47:47] so perfect
[1:47:48] well this wouldn't happen if so-and-so
[1:47:50] wouldn't have done this if so-and-so
[1:47:51] hadn't done this so and so when they've
[1:47:52] done that
[1:47:53] someone said you know what maybe you
[1:47:54] should have been on the council board in
[1:47:55] heaven
[1:47:57] man god should have hired you as the
[1:48:00] director of human resources
[1:48:02] god doesn't need our help
[1:48:06] the only needs are yielding to him
[1:48:10] there are trials along the way all the
[1:48:13] trials are molding
[1:48:14] and to get us in position
[1:48:18] nothing's out of order amen
[1:48:23] the background the setting sometimes the
[1:48:26] setting
[1:48:26] changes for us but even if you change
[1:48:29] the setting on a believer
[1:48:31] you can't change a believer put them in
[1:48:34] nazareth
[1:48:35] put them in babylon put them in satan's
[1:48:37] e you change the setting on them
[1:48:39] you don't change a believer a believer
[1:48:42] is a believer
[1:48:43] is a believer no matter where they're at
[1:48:45] they're a believer
[1:48:46] [Applause]
