i know i know the [Music] [Music] when [Music] [Music] i know [Music] [Music] aren't you glad for that this morning amen and i'm glad he's not somewhere far off amen he's right here with us he's a friend that sticks closer than a brother he said i'd be with you even in you to the end of the age amen we are we are serving an unfailing god many things that we can look back all the way down through the scriptures god would have his prophet in this hour take us back into things even the building of the masterpiece and how that could step back and you know but god was working in each one of those phases of their lives noah god was working in abraham as a matter of fact how brother branham would place it think of the wisdom of god he would speak to us in this manner and show to us that you know when you look at a like michelangelo's the sculpture of moses it has a base that it sets on the base is the foundation is what it's built upon and paul said i've laid the foundation where there no other man can lay but that foundation all the parts within it because remember four is the number of life four is a number of earthly deliveries and in that pedestal you have an abraham represented which is that of the election of god then you have isaac the love of god then you have jacob and brother graham says oh anybody that's ever read jacob's life knows about the grace of god and then you have joseph perfection that is the foundation of the faith of jesus christ that our lives are built upon that's what the new birth brings in our life it brings the reveal the election of god to our hearts amen it reveals and manifests the love of god through our lives the grace of god and the perfection of god amen and we're built up as brother braham said the body notice he said the body is built by the word the prophets amen i'm glad we're we're not made by man our experience is not a man-made experience amen we're not walking by the dictates of a man oh my our eyes have been opened our eyes have been opened i i think here you know brother branham made a statement in the message where there were some people that you know were they they were complaining of talking about the tapes and things like that and here was another man that had got a hold of the tapes brother bam just rehearsing to this people were saying ah my you know i just say with brother branham i'm just confused and this and that brother branham he recites back what someone has said regarding the tapes that person said i was confused until i started listening to the tapes i'm telling you we were confused until this message came our way you want to know how to break confusion over your life get in the message well brother samuel i'm looking at this website get off of that website oh i listen to this brother preach and not saying that you shouldn't maybe that it's not okay to listen to somebody minister but remember we have received a message in this hour avail ourselves in this message because god has sent this message to you and i and in this message is rapturing faith it gives us strength to fly in this hour we're not living in an hour think about all the other four anointings think of the four anointings that was there the lion four feet on the ground but it manifested kingly power in the earth there's a part of that in our life there has to be a manifesting of kingly power in our life that there has been a kingdom that has been overthrown and a new king has come in on the throne and it manifests itself visibly in this earth then we also have the the ox right feet on the ground a life that sacrifice labor labor of love then we have the next part the man the man anointed right the wisdom of man the the that part that god would tap in but once again it's feet on the ground all of it's necessary but in this hour god has sent the eagle anointing and the eagle anointing is not an earth-bound anointing the eagle anointing is that which came from the heavenlies down to earth not that we would become settled upon the earth but that we would be caught up caught up in him strengthened in him oh glory be to god oh don't you love him yes i know the master of the wind i know the maker amen aren't you glad this morning amen i just love him we're going to let you be seated here just a moment i'm going to ask brother shane if he'll come and i want him to present just a few slides here these they've put together so appreciate everything that the trustees here have done so i'm just going to turn it over him here in just a moment and as he's making ready here as you brothers will switch that over when he gets it up i also want to remind you the calendar that was sent out of lord willing have a fellowship dinner here coming up on the 20th which is two weeks from this coming sunday and then also was mentioned in there of the memorial day meetings that we'll have coming up and there'll be more details uh in memorial day remembers in in may that's may be before we know it i mean there's things that uh well i won't go into that because you could probably say oh brother you're mine but my mind's not too off i i i'm glad it's sharp on certain things when it comes to the word of god other things that i forget here and there oh my you know i complain but say god don't don't let that leave me you know i like when though that comes back to me but remember memorial day meetings here at the end of may and then also next uh sunday lord willing the special offering and brother shane's going to touch on some of these things here amen god bless you church brother richie brother aaron and myself has some exciting news this morning i'll try to be quick but first before i go to the next slide a couple weeks ago brother sam had offered a prayer for this project and uh to be honest we're really at least for myself we're really struggling to get a hold of these contractors because it's the end of the year they're kind of wrapping things up and i don't know who was praying or if everyone was praying but things changed and uh people who i've tried to reach out i mean i've called three four times left voicemails nothing emails nothing texts nothing and it's like all of a sudden it's like that following week after that sunday he had said that like like they answered their phone it was like whoa things changed so uh anyway so we have awarded the bid to brooks concrete they're out of lorraine they're pretty familiar in the area and we're going to start this in may if he can't get us in may it'd be first week of june for the amount beginning at the do the job is 17 thousand four hundred dollars and then upon completion seven thousand four hundred dollars per total of fourteen thousand eight and then uh instead of doing phases i quickly learned i'm not i don't know much about concrete but uh from speaking with four to five different contractors instead of grouping it and i think we had four or five phases we're going to do it all in one it's actually a lot cheaper so this will again the the north west side where brother samuel parks and then up through the playground area that will be part of it the front walkway the entrance ramp and then the front porch that will all be done through brook's concrete and then we'll get a group of brothers together to do the metal roof extension over the ramp and the porch so that we'll be doing that ourselves and then just a quick reminder of what it's going to look like you have the current wood there will be a concrete ramp four feet wide 27 four feet long 27 feet long and then a four feet wide concrete side and it'll be similar to this with the black railing and then you got your concrete pad with the two steps on the left and the right and then they'll have these same railings here around it and then here's the concrete walkway this is the same thing from the first slide just in case you forgot and then from the total collected on december 19th we had 2 191 and on january 9th we had 1 304 for total so far of 3 495 so the remaining cost of the project is 11 305 and then this next slide is just kind of looking ahead obviously we're one step at a time but i know it's talked about a lot the church parking lot is you know in need of some work but we also got this quoted for just it's a big number uh seventy thousand dollars for the whole parking lot and then the right driveway which is currently concrete right now is seventeen thousand five hundred dollars just just something to think about we're not jumping on this now just wanted to present that he said god bless [Applause] stan i appreciate that shane mentioned it was true they weren't getting any bids back and when you look at the bid that they they didn't just accept the bid that was the lowest but that is the lowest bid brother shane when he was doing the contact for different ones the ones that we had narrowed down and they could have the brothers could have probably asked a lot of other people brother shane went by things that who was recommended within the county and had good ratings because we just didn't want we don't want something just to be done to do it we want something that's done well and uh so we're so thankful that they god turned that around they got everything got back with us and they were able to look at all the bids that were there and some of the bids were much higher close to double that amount and one of the things that as shane pointed out this this the walkway that we have out here right now is real real wide it's like a driveway the sidewalk that's going in there is not going to be that wide it's going to be a sidewalk but it's going to be built up so everything's going to be raised up so then we go to do the parking lot and start to grade that and there's other things that we have to take care of brother ritchie we're talking about that the brothers that over and there so that everything can be graded off because there's some other things with the water right now and i don't mean to take time but you realize there's a lot of times we've had things where everyone said what about the parking lot the parking lot well you remember when we did the chip and seal parking lot back in the days and it shipped it broke up like like nothing and the reason one of the things is so right here is there's no channeling of that water they got water that and if we were to put concrete down at that time which yeah it was a lot less money but it would have been busted up there was new pieces out here in this driveway that was put out there and because it wasn't raised up it was just busted up in no time so um you know thank god we've had different ones to look at that and there's some ideas on how to channel that that water getting that water because some of it is actually like coming up and brother joey you know you hunt back there bobby you know back there we could we could probably stop that back there with bass and everything go fishing here in the summertime the water is so bad you back in there but it's not just there if you look at a topographic map here of sheffield there's ditches everywhere and that's how they run the water so um just you know let's just be in prayer about all those things certainly appreciate you praying and giving and may god richly bless you let's just turn turn into the word of god i'd like to read from haggai chapter one again i want to go right back into there and i'm just going to this morning i want to just resume from where we were in this thought on honest reflections and uh just pray that you'll just bear with me here this morning we'll just see how far the lord will take us in here because we certainly want to want to hear from him i'm not really interested in how much ground i can cover i just want to make sure that it's following him so in haggai chapter 1 verse 1. you can read there in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shatil governor of judah and to joshua the son of joseph the high priest saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time has not come the time that the lord's house should be built let me just you don't have to turn there but if the brothers will pull that up i think i have that in ezra chapter four if you want to you can turn there but i want to just go back into this where we stop that because i want to move from here we're finding where the people that is what's being spoken through them at that time the time has not come so then we look back here in ezra 4 we're looking back at what is the source of the problem why are are they expressing that this is not the time there was they wasn't saying it's not god's will uh to not rebuild the temple that's not what they were saying they were just pushing it out to a latter time and so when looking at the source of the problem remember brother branham would take us in the message he that is in you and brother branham would deal with situations that that are being seen whether it's through ministers or other things like that and brother brahm says now he says we must find the source of the problem and dealing with the source of the problem here we come into ezra 4 and verse 1 and it says when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of israel then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your god as you do now notice this the temple of god is being built and notice the first approach the first approach is in innocency and harmlessness that's how the enemy comes in amen see the enemy has an objective and he has a plan so this is how he approaches it at first to see will they let down on just the innocency hey yeah we'll take you to help build with us we do sacrifice unto him since the days of the sergeant king of esser which brought us up thither and in reality when you nail that down that's not really true they sacrificed all kinds of idols too it was just so verse three now zerubbabel and joshua the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us now notice they came to the they came to the leadership and the leadership put a start stop to it right away this is not coming into my home this is not coming into the camp amen are you hearing me the leadership was there to discern and say this is not going to be discussed at dinner over there's no discussion to this we know what god has said and this is not coming in to say well you think we should pray about it no this is what god has said there's no discussion there's no prayer this is an attack of the enemy amen that's why in this hour we must must must walk by spiritual discernment because sometimes the things that we can see can give us seemingly nice warm fuzzies but it's not of god amen verse 4 then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah now what same people now watch how they're coming now they weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building wow these are the same guys that were oh you guys you guys are new in the neighborhood here's a here's a chocolate cake we've baked for you and i'm not saying that's wonderful your neighbor bakes it you know let it all be received with thanksgiving pray over it and eat it maybe not all in the same night but you understand because when we're looking at this here they come now it's they're not coming with a nice big cake here they're coming this has been the mission the whole time you didn't respond to it that way now we'll move to another horse see this is the this is the ride that has taken place down through the ages from the white horse now to a red horse now we're going to come with power then the people of the land weaken the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia i tell you these people if we could say it like this they that hired counselors and they that come they had this whole work and a picture on their refrigerator and they were saying we must stop this we must stop this because you see how this work had started the people were gathered as one man to jerusalem there was a uniting that had come with a vision and a purpose and satan's desire was to break that unity break that purpose to weaken them if they won't accept my in the innocency then i'm just going to just i'm just not going to stop i'm going to keep pounding at him keep pounding at him keep i'll bring all sorts of things to eventually they let down let's pray heavenly father we thank you this morning for your mercy your god we ask you that you will just have your way in this service lord i would ask that you would just help me help the man part to step aside i'm asking that you'll come lord in a very personal way even as the hearts of your children are praying lord that god you'll just pass by our way and speak to our hearts in a personal way we give ourselves to you lord for your working lord for your glory may you just pour out of your spirit among us in a very special and personal way we pray in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you for being seated i also want to get in here into the subject here i want to welcome back sister judith and her daughter amen i also want to welcome brother constantine's wife doleen but i get that right god bless you good to have you good to have you amen so i just want to just welcome them if there's anybody else we missed for the bobby you michelle you know i you know one thing i'll tell you i know i have many faults and you could probably list them for me but i may have a longer list than you the one thing that i have as real as a fault is i get up here i can see certain things oh yes my mind i've got a one-track mind when it comes to standing here i don't say that for any i just say i i forget there's some things that i do because we miss you when you're not here and so glad to have you all here back with us and then see different ones that they met just with us recovering i also want to remember uh continue to remember sister shirley press and prayer god will just continue to strengthen our sister and her body as well and uh just brother dave's good to see you here we just um i know brother dave is been dealing with some pain as well in his body not some but we talked about that and also want to want to encourage his sister my my aunt linda i don't know if they put the prayer request in i know they did but um it's natural for the lungs to fill up with water and then they have to drain them off and then they said that's natural she's had to have that done twice already and i just just want to encourage you is when you're praying not only for sister linda but for every need don't stop praying until like peter they're knocking on the door amen you hear they're getting better oh they went out the first ward keep praying oh they're out the second word keep praying oh they're out the third lord keep praying oh they're out the city keep praying keep praying until they stand right there amen that's good amen oh we just love the lord but i want to just take just for a few moments here just to look upon these things in honest reflections in ezra chapter 4 continuing on there here you have in verse 23 these people that continue to so not only are they coming against those who have come back to jerusalem um under zerubbabel and joshua to build the temple ezra's not come yet nehemiah's not come yet you see the temple's got to be built then the teacher comes are you with me see this is all the layers of the new birth then once the new birth has come then you build up the walls god doesn't take care of the outside first he deals with the inside he works from the inside out when he gets on the inside then he'll show you how to use the gates and put the bars and everything upon them so because everything in the scripture all of it is to speak of jesus christ and that of redemption so they were coming the the the adversaries notice how the scriptures identifies them even before as they're coming in innocency that they are adversaries and this is where we can say god i i need the continual discernment of the holy spirit i want to stay close to him so that there are things that i myself would not be able to discern without his leadership as a matter of fact brother branham would say it like this when he would deal with um in in the the first seal and he would say that that antichrist that spirit he said he's a cunning fellow daniel speaks of him being a cunning fellow he's he's we see even in the garden of eden more subtle he was a very subtle person right not the the serpent was subtle but satan came in and anointed that fertility is that right he used that right and this is why even in this hour that the scripture says he is worshiped satan is worshipped as god and he's worshiped through the reasoning and the knowledge and all the theology of man but we know that there's one provided way of worship and that's through the blood there's one place that we're to come through and that's the blood but notice it's called that of an adversary and brother brahm tells us with that antichrist he said there's no one that can undo him or outsmart him but the holy ghost and that's why in this hour that that's what the message of the hour has brought to our lives is a uniting with the holy ghost not a sensation we'll take them not an emotion we take them hey come on now you can't put emotion and sensation out you're going to be emotional about something but when god has come down in the depths of your heart you've got something real to be emotional about oh jesus help us so notice adversaries the discernment coming in that manner the verse ezra chapter 4 verse 23 here is a letter that's coming from azerxes and this is read before riam and shimsha verse 23 the scribe and their companions and they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews these guys weren't messing around they were doing everything they could to try to shut them down and when they realized hey they're not shutting down they started bringing false accusations against them i know a lot of times we hear the words sticks and stones uh may break my bones but words will never hurt me but that's not really true that's not really true false accusations this is why with false accusations you can either allow them to accumulate in your life or take them before the throne of almighty god you got a choice if we allow them to accumulate in our life we find ourselves going down down down but if we'll take our lives before the throne of god then we begin to see things in a different light notice they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made them to cease by force and power then cease the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem now i want you i want you just to think of this here they are they're made to stop by force and by power but they didn't come back to jerusalem by natural power are you hearing me now they didn't come back there by natural power this was a vision of the word that god had already spoken and prophesied through jeremiah god had revealed it through daniel they did not come back there of their own natural cord listen it is not within man to find his way back they might have knew the land well we got to get back to jerusalem but the way back you must know the way back and the way back was not a natural way it was a spiritual way their heart had went away from god so their heart had to be turned back to jerusalem and that was inspiration that was sealed up in the prophecy but when that prophecy would begin to be opened in that hour remember within that prophecy lays an anointing because the true anointing upon our life is the word of almighty god that's why the person says i've been born of the holy ghost and they don't live in the word walk in the word and reflect the word of god and says amen to everything in the word of god they have not been anointed by the word and have not been born again they might have had an anointing upon their flesh upon their mind and upon their spirit but when that anointing of the word comes down where the word unites with the word inside in your soul it changes your life from a creature of time to a creature of eternity you're not an old man patched up you are a new creation oh let's look at the word correctly this morning don't look down say if it is there with air in your life and you're seeing something it's the light of god shining upon his word that allows us to look into the smear and say woe is me lord change my life lord change me completely so this foundation had been a foundation laid but it was in an unfinished state i don't know about you but there's things at times that i've even got a project right now around my around my house i've been little by little and sometimes because i'm not a builder i'm not at this that i i have to think about things a little bit longer and when you have things that's unfinished or you have things that maybe it's a hole in the wall hole in the ceiling or you've got something that maybe carpets not down whatever it is it's only a reminder that's not finished it's something that you walk by every day and man i got to get to that i got to get on that all right and see that foundation they had laid that under great pain and great stress and under great persecution but now where they were at it was an unfinished state now let me tell you something god could have come down and god could have spoke that temple into existence but that is not his way just like when god comes to deal with our life the real birth of the holy ghost is a word birth it's a word experience is that right it's by the spoken word of almighty god but god won't override our will it has to be i will surrender to his will that's called dying to south and when that is that comes to that place then the will of god breaks forth fully in our life to bring forth the new birth unfinished state god is an author and a finisher you believe that amen he's not gonna god don't do nothing halfway amen and this is the promise he said he will perform it until the day of jesus christ now i want you to to examine this as we're looking in honest reflection i want you to examine it and allow the holy spirit to examine for every aspect of our life and every no matter where you're at in your walk with god whether you haven't started or you have started and maybe here you are in journey to to that of the new birth and then others that of us that have been born again have already crossed into that land this the supplies this right here applies to every one of us right you say brother samuel what do you mean well let me just be very simple you can't listen to the message of the hour i don't care what message you pick out you cannot listen to that message and not have the reality of the new birth not being ministered amen sometimes it's said specifically are you hearing me that's good other times here it is it now stands for the light shines forth and anytime when we're listening and really listening to the message of the hour there should really be some gleaning and feeding going on don't just be a listener be a feeder a feeder sometimes you've got to stop it and say lord help me to live up to that standard of the word that's being a feeder we don't want to be a hearer we want to be doers of the word we've not been anointed just to hear we've been anointed to do there's something that moves within us oh glory be to god we're interested in getting out of here don't you appreciate i appreciate when they i'm getting ready to get on an airplane i appreciate all the checks they do i understand sometimes you know i've been late getting out of somewhere there was one time i was supposed to fly when i was supposed to fly to arkansas the one time you know and go down there and minister oh my i came over here to park early in the morning well the plane flying to detroit and then down over to jonesborough well you know when i got there but here i am and they said you know what something's wrong with this plane and you know we need to send down to atlanta get our mechanics up here and look at this plane so okay i'll just study because i don't have to preach tonight anyhow down in their meetings i'm just going to study i i'm all right i got my i got my my notebook here i'm going to study so i sat there you know what time i finally got out of there i didn't finally i didn't get out of almost four in the afternoon five six somewhere around there flew i think i had to fly to atlanta and then over into jonesboro now here's what they said though on this plane going to detroit if i wanted to take it about 10 o'clock now you all have to help me out altomonder automator altimeter whatever that tells the height that ain't working but we don't have to go that high anyhow no thank you i'll stay right here if i've got to take an early morning flight tomorrow to get down there to preach i'll do it what am i saying i'm saying this right here i want to make sure this is an hour yes amen we're in an astronaut age blast-off is upon us when they enter into that that that chamber there they're looking at all the gauges love check forgiveness oh need a little bit a little bit more there patience got a little bit low here during cove but give me some more right now no no no we can't do that you're asking for it wrong we want to check all the gauges don't we we want to check it all because it's very important that there be no leak at all [Music] now notice in daniel 9 25 this was already spoken this whole part of what would take place when they came back into the land in verse 25 this is when gabriel is making known to daniel when daniel had begun to remember the inspiration regarding that of the 70 of the 70 weeks and so forth notice he says that knowing therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score in two weeks so two separate time periods seven weeks and then the three score in two weeks then messiah prince comes but notice now it breaks back over here into those seven weeks which is that period of time the 49 years when they were going to go back into jerusalem to rebuild the temple after their deliverance from babylon the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublest times go and let them know it's going to be troubleless times but you know it's something about it that that does not become the emphasis that was not the emphasis in leaving jerusalem i mean sometimes let me just be very frank with you sometimes the really serving god we need to we we will say god help me to be a real example that it would be something that somebody says you know what i want what you got yes lord because what we have should produce real joy amen come on friends there's a power in this world to break depression this is not condemnation there's a power in this word you say what must i do say what the word says and rebuke the devourer back him up off of your land you've got to write as a child of god amen he can try to condemn you and say well look at you you're depressed or you're anxious or you're sick or you're this or that that's a that's a false accusation he's coming against the working of a real son and daughter of god what should i do i take the side of the word and regardless of what my feeling said i say what the word said and say food devil amen i can only move my pinky brother man i'm told it's clean you move the pinky next you'll be moving your hand you move your hand then you'll be moving your arm after you move your arm then you'll start moving both arms then eventually you get up off the bed little by little by little by little amen amen glory be to god say brother samuel what are you saying well i'm saying like this right here that is there any fight in you are you hearing me is there any fight in you if we could ask these these these individuals here they have been getting blasted and adversaries and everything coming at them but you know what it was it wasn't the adversaries that shut them down it's because they got away from their source of strength there wasn't any fight in them because they got away from their source of strength now hear me really closely i'm not going to preach on this this morning but a source of strength isn't just standing up here and asking god for prayer but a source of strength god can pray and bring down in our faith and if you don't have faith god has faith as faith right here provided i can place my faith right there and pray and i believe the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up i believe that there's quickening power right here in the body of jesus christ but it matters what you do after you go out of here amen your source of strength is a daily daily daily walk with god amen yes sir but brother samuel i thought everything was going to be a picnic no we know better than that troubleless times troubleless times persecution comes in many different forms but jesus said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not be able to prevail against it second timothy 3 12 78 and all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution let me just say it like this i'm not going around with a banner saying hey i'd like some persecution i'm not a fool they didn't ask for persecution persecution was coming their way anybody walk around and say you know what i ain't been sick in a while i think i'd right like be sick if you do you need prayer for something else nobody walks around like that like remember brother jewel when he was here years ago told the story of a man that said you know what i ain't had a test in a trial for a long time man i ain't had nothing i'll tell you what brother you you better better not be praying that and all of a sudden that brother got way late see god knows what you and i are able to handle amen are you hearing me there's tests and trials you go through right now as a believer let me say this to you even with the experience in your life god has so fitted it because the trial and the test is not upon you to destroy you it's to prove you it's god's not against you that's what satan that's the lie he told you all right brother brown said when job got to listening to it that's what had him whipped come on you can read the book of job and you know joe started trying to justify himself you still want moving him from his message come on friends there's times that you can get weak but that's why you need the holy ghost in your life you might get weak you might get down but when all your human reasoning breaks away there is an anchor right there in your life that'll hold you stable it'll hold you constant that'll be able to recognize the voice of god speaking to it and so our feelings might be out here but that on the inside we'll catch the voice of god and says yes lord all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution persecution comes jesus remember how jesus he wrote of this we see it all the way down through the old testament matter of fact brother brown would say the simple this persecution and trials are a natural normal part of life it's just as normal as clothing food shelter it's normal and brother brad makes it clear he says there's not one believer free from it not one church free from it see when we see this there's only one thing all that live godly in christ now the objective to live godly in christ satan if he can try to cool you off that's right they say you know what hey uh all the demons that were dispatched over there you don't need that no more that's that's that's already settled and stopped i need you over here on this one they're blazing hot we got to cool them down well wonder how we should come at them well we've got many avenues to come at them we've got many avenues to bring persecution we can come in real innocently let's try that approach first all right they had become weary these these these believers they had become weary and discouraged you've ever been discouraged anybody been weary yeah over and over in the scripture think not all right right right the discouragement can come but remember satan's on a mission he's on a mission to break the purpose of god but let me remind you devil we're on a mission too [Applause] our mission didn't come from an earthly headquarters come on now we have been commissioned yes from heaven amen we have heard a voice said come out of her my people amen you were not ordained to give yourself and your lives to all of those influences of babylon but you're ordained to be a tabernacle a place of habitation come out of her and be ye shepherd saith the lord we've received a divine commission from a mighty angel that this message itself that came amen it was echoed on earth there through the angel that god had sent the prophet in this hour and heaven this angel and his message was so inclined with heaven that heaven echoed that message what do you say it shows right now that just as much as that message as heaven was inclined that was inclined with heaven that the people of god that are moved by this revelation are inclined with the mind of god they are in tune and in harmony with the holy spirit and the purpose of almighty god hallelujah much pressure had come their way every one of us faced pressure let us be reminded here when god told joshua i've given you the land that didn't mean that they only could walk just walk in there and just take it you'll fight for every inch of it hallelujah amen god has promised healing but you'll fight for every inch of it god has promised the baptism of the holy ghost you'll fight for every inch of it you won't be fighting against god you're fighting against your own will that's why there's times there's got to be a wrestling match like jacob when jacob finally surrendered come on friends sometimes it might take agonizing come on brother told us there ain't no set pattern it can fall right here while the preaching of the word is going forth is that right yes but the main thing is is that how does the holy ghost come he comes when it is a fully surrendered repented heart amen if the holy ghost hasn't come you've got to have a full repentance a turning from a full surrender is that right mean business about things if there's things in your life and you know that the holy ghost won't come on that don't make excuses for it go to war against that thing you've got god on your side amen say i'm here i'm here for the promise that god has made to me i don't care what the devil is he might be a pornographic devil a lust devil a drinking devil you can line every one of them up they don't have a right to stand on the god-given grounds that belongs to sons and daughters of god you've got a right you are authorized by a power a heavenly power that says this land i've given you take it amen so let us be reminded i've given you the land and every time god inspires your heart to do something satan's going to be there to challenge you that's right he's going to be there to bring every kind of accusation against you but let's be wise we're not ignorant of his devices that's only to try to back you up from the promises amen what do i do maybe start out with a little food say what the word says about you hallelujah oh glory be to god oh my you know satan would be all right he's all right you know if people you know just be just become a church member well you know we go to believer spoken word tabernacle and you know we believe that god sent a prophet and he's all right when you believe in god sent a prophet he does matter of fact he knows is that right hallelujah he knows he was cast out night after night are you hearing me right now he's into no dispute listen there ain't no disputing satan he knows that's right that william branham is the prophet of god and no disputing that whatsoever he knows it just as much as he knows that jesus is the son of god and he believes it and trembles but you see he's not believing it in the right way oh my my he wants to try to cool us off all right you see we we we we should set our sights and i would say it like this god help us to set our sights i want to be an effectual believer i want my life to be effectual i'm not interested just showing up to church i want to be effectual amen i want to be a part of the vision and what's going on in the kingdom of god well brother samuel i got this and i got this and i got this going on let me remind you the scripture as it was in the days of noah so shall it also be in the coming of the son of man the bible says they ate drank and were married they busy this is the scripture they were so focused on earthly things they missed the animals going by they missed the door being closed that's the bible they missed it they had become so focused with earthly things the prophet picks it up flashing red lights or is coming nothing wrong with eating we might eat a little too much but nothing wrong with drinking right things right right everybody needs water brother and pick set up that way building none wrong building right but this is why they became occupied with self that's so good oh god you might preach food he's in convention conviction satan can't stop the purpose of god are you hearing me satan can't stop the purpose of god he can't stop the word of god from being fulfilled right you know i'm referring to the scriptures in romans let's so let's be a partaker of the unstoppable god by revelation lord yes amen because revelation that revelation of jesus christ holds within it prevailing power you see persecution and all those things it comes it comes adversity comes many different forms mary brother brown tells us about the young girl there was two young ladies one of them was a um we're twins brother um steve robson robson from mountain flagstaff was able to get in contact with one of them they're still alive and witness of what took place there we have it on tape but you know of where here you have the one young girl my brother brandon i want you to listen to me carefully brother brown said she had she had you know given her life to christ so she had had you know an initial experience but it wasn't a born-again experience she hadn't passed from death onto life she got out there in college and around a lot of these other you know in this professor this psychologist begin to try to come at her and say you ain't never kissed a boy really you must be a weirdo you know this those of you you listen to message and what happened brother brandon says that that's pressure that came upon her it sent her into a mental institution now her sister she had a full testimony it wasn't that pressure didn't come to her right as soon as you make a stand for god let me tell you something it's just like every hound of hell has been turned loose on you as a matter of fact let's put it in the words the prophet said every gun out of hell is trained upon you he said he'll try to shoot every dart at you he'll bring every vowel person around you if there's been habits in your life he'll line those devils up and anoint those people to come what you're trying to do he's trying to withstand that work that god is doing in your lives what should i do don't turn to the natural things of life turn to your source of strength the god who brought conviction in your eye for you to repent turn to your source of strength and draw from him amen sometimes people turn to so many other things for for answers in their life instead of turning to the lord in this day and age we have people walk around with a phone glued to it they turn to that for answers turn to it for a source of strength but i need some down really when i look at the statistics what i read is there's more depression because of that stuff that's right come on friends i think we need to evaluate where's our source of strength hello somebody i'm not saying oh brother simon's against smartphones that's not what i'm saying matter of fact mine's been very helpful to me when i'm sitting in doctor's offices with different ones i study on my phone i'm not going to say that i'm perfect but i'm telling you right now that i do appreciate things i'm going to files and studying there so because you know what when i'm at a doctor's appointment okay i just moved from the office and i run over here but you understand that's also a place where there's temptations placed before you now help me preach now i'm not all speaking of black dark sin i'm talking about temptation to where things in your life starts building into a place of unbelief because what you give yourself to you will become dominated by you must remember white dog and black dog when you've been born of the spirit of almighty god you must remember it's whit dog you feed the most wins so persecution is going to come but that young lady i was speaking about brother branham went there and he met with her and you know what begin to speak and the holy spirit went out and got her went on got her spirit right where she was and brought it right back around and centered it right back around jesus christ it broke that hole let me tell you something these aren't just words are you hearing me mom and dad these aren't just words right well i don't know what my kid is doing shame on you you want to know what they're doing you're called to be responsible for those things come on friends i sit there in conferences with things where where parents have spoken that their kids sitting right beside them on a couch have got into things and they didn't even know how to how to do it or the parents didn't realize it was going on it's kind of almost my mind was sitting here trying to figure out how in the world you say oh my kids shouldn't do that but we believe the message remember the token is an application yes amen the token isn't well praise god we believe the message the token is the holy ghost you can read the message and know that god sent a prophet that's not the token the token is the life of jesus christ on display and everything must have the token this is this is right now i i think we ought to say that let's say that we're now together now the people are saying oh this ain't the time i think right now we need to say right now is the time right now whatever you have need of in your life it needs to be a declaration right now well i failed back here but what about now you can't go back and change the past you can't go back and change the things that well you know i wish i would have been more fervent here you can't go change it but you can get back to and go beyond where you were how do i get back oh i got to get back here got to get back it's a condition of the heart i'm a lot in time for when brother shane was up here we took some of your time and that's all right with that i'll require that a brother shane later now that need to be done but i'm just let's look here just for a moment haggai chapter one verse three let's let's read on down could we now notice this in verse three let's go into this you see god's discerning the people are saying now is the time has not come now i want you to watch this god didn't go to mama god getting god did not go to son and daughter god reveals his word in a divine order are you with me that's why god never called the sister to leave the home that's right preach with me amen god never know well i tell you my wife is more spiritual than me shame on you you're announcing your coldness that's good can the church say amen yes sir that should not be the case now you might want to go to a quote on me and say well rebecca was more spiritual in the case of jacob and esau but let me remind you rebecca encouraged jacob to lie preach brother samuel preach brother samuel are you hearing me now she fostered that nature that was in him as a deceiver isaac wouldn't have fostered that isaac would have said a deceiver won't work and a deceiver is not worthy of the covenant that's why we are not brought into the covenant by a woman ruth never came in by a woman ruth came in by boaz ram came in by saying oh and we come into the body by the man christ jesus that's why god didn't send a church in this hour and the mighty angel came down [Applause] [Music] the groom has entered the arena first he's the initiator of the covenant then here comes the bride the groom coming is to announce the bride is coming amen say she's not coming she's here hallelujah she's here there's an order god's entrusted us listen as a leader of the home it isn't getting around and we're going to do this and we don't do that we do this we don't do that we do this we don't do that look listen friends let's just be very honest now every one of us coming up through even our initial beginnings even when i didn't have a family we all tend to start out in a very legalistic way sometimes within our natures it kind of gets stuck come on things that ought to be brother bram said god has all kinds in his kingdom dogmatic ones and this and this and this they have to we all have to understand our temperament and our makeup is that right but we want to make sure that we're not choking on nats and swallowing camels brother so-and-so's not doing this they're not doing that what is that that's a nat and then we got a big old camel going down our throat come on friends my lord have mercy who knew this was all packed in here jesus hallelujah hey friends this is good it's coming right down to where we live this is about getting out of here oh sometimes these things as god brings up it can seem awful hard but we know it's not a man it's god speaking to us it's the love of god being ministered to our hearts to get us ready and make us more effectual believers as we'll agree with the word of god in line up with it notice verse 3 then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste the house of now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways see the lord of hosts oh my the innumerable company of angels how the angels brother said let the angels take their posts throughout every one of these buildings the building next to every person brethren even told us why the words being preached and there's that nudging hey hey you need to surrender that hey hey you need to get the right that's an angel dealing with your life amen the lord of hosts oh my god's message is a message that's letting them know the lord of hosts all the angels everything is gathered right here is for this purpose but before he can be restored we need honest reflection consider that's good your ways well brother samuel if you've ever known them adversaries no no your ways well the devil may no no your ways the devil can't make us do nothing that's right oh sir brother how many times do you hear this in the message brother brown puts it very clear people say well the devil made me go under he said no the problem was you weren't sealed in all right so consider our ways i'll tell you let's just be honest whether you get on the scale and maybe you don't ever have maybe you don't have to worry about a scale or whether you stand in front of the mirror sometimes and there's certain things in front of that mirror that you see you don't like but a mirror remember as we said here some i don't know what service it was a mirror is not a picture that's right that's all right that's good i mean i can put a picture up there you know i could have a big old picture you know like they got these you know superstar or basketball sir i put it on the wall there but it's a picture of samuel when it was at my best whenever that was i had hair not see-through hair but i mean i had hair comb would get stuck in it and i looked at jenna said my goodness you see the problem of it is that's a stationary image that's an idol and an idol doesn't move an idol doesn't have ears or eyes and an idol has to be packed around but my god's not an idol hallelujah oh my get my dancing shoes on now i don't have to pack him around but at times when i've needed packing he's packed me around he's lifting me up when i need his strength he's strengthened me it ain't me packing him he's packing me but looking at that picture i could look at that picture walk out there oh goodness man that's good and i'm walking around my mind is i'm thinking i'm just like that picture right there and i can still get out there and play with the boys some of you get there don't worry but a mirror is not a picture a mirror shows presently emir don't show well i'll tell you what i'll tell you what five years ago i tell you before cloven no no no no no that's a this is a mirror we're not talking about a picture oh brother samuel i was on fabric no we're not talking about a picture a mere shows where you are now and you must have the i am who can show you this is where you was this is where you are but this is where you need to be and you need to get do you need to get this connected you need to get pains connected not just well i'll tell you what i was saying no no it ain't what you were 10 years ago what are you now oh my look at this in verse six you have sown much and bring in little i want you to listen to these verses you have sown much these were guys weren't lazy they didn't stop working on the temple of god and all of a sudden you know throughout the 401k put up their lazy boy and said we're just going to wait on the rapture no that's not what they were doing they was already in them to work let me tell you something god has built every one of us to labor it depends on what you're laboring for that's true jesus said labor not for the meat that perishes amen belabor for that meat that cometh from the son of man himself whom god the father has healed labor for that revealed word labor press in for that reality amen because we're going to labor for something is that right you have sown much see this is why god would say you shall love the lord thy god with all thine heart soul mind body and strength you've sown much and bring in little you eat but you don't have enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you clothe but there's none more and he that earneth wages earth wages to put it into a bag with holes what's god letting them know what god's trying to say hey your efforts you haven't been lazy people you've been very fervent but you're fervent in the wrong things all right that is so good oh i'm gonna check the ingredients on this bread because heaven knows i don't want no pesticide in my bread that ain't me but what about everything that you hear about everything you give your spirit to and your heart to come on friends we ought to be checking ingredient levels not just looking at saying it's bread what is that discernment of spirit amen verse seven i'm going to come down here in just a moment thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways god didn't forget that he already said this what's he doing he spoke now what do you see this is what i see what do you see consider your ways you see when the word is coming forth it exposes brings to view brings to light and the greatest thing we can do is agree with that word and say that's nothing but the truth amen so amen because there is a power in this word let me remind you that brother bannon tells us in daniel 70 weeks he said they wonder why you and i won't go along with their denominational schemes and cluck up with those hens he said because there's been a message that god has revealed and he said there's a power and a vision behind it to get the bride in order for the rapture this word holds transforming power in it amen that same transforming power his calls out to you and i if you get out of step brother carlos brother brother gomez the rest of them brothers were in the military they know if you get out of step you don't gotta run it's a half step all right you got to do that i don't know how you do that kick maybe demonstrate it for some kind of a kick you know brother stacy goodbread demonstrated it for us it was just a you know just a simple little step it ain't a big step like oh my goodness i've really went out a lot it's a half step [Applause] glory be to god amen i'm telling your friend there's a power right in this word there's a power in this word of transformers a power to lift you and i up come on friends we don't need to be told how sorry we are we know how sorry we are come on friends but when conviction needs to come to our life we need to be people that say god let conviction come let my life walk by conviction let me walk with real honest reflection amen notice consider your ways go up to the mountain now he's given them this is the way back consider your ways and go up to the mountain now in order to go up to the mountain you've got to turn from what you're focused on you get turned and focused back on the house of god see because the house of god needs to be built our lives are to be built up in the things of god go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith the lord verse 9 you looked for much and loit came to live and when you brought it home i did blow up on it why saith the lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man into his own house i'll just stop there for you i'm going to balance this out not that it needs balance but what you understand it isn't that god and i want you to listen to me very clearly it isn't that god these individuals had an eagerness towards sowing much but reaping little you say well that means god don't want me to have more no god was letting him know he has promises that he's given us but if you get the order turned around and put the priorities on other things and god said i will get your attention because my purpose will not be defeated god knows how to get our attention and bring correction back god's not against and i want you to understand hey look these guys have preached that prosperity gospel watermark you know what they preach from they take principles from the word of god yeah you think they're the only ones probably i don't know what they drive mercedes-benz or whatever more i mean i see more mercedes-benz on the roads now than i've ever seen but see these are scriptural principles right they tap into those scriptural principles you see what we're we're tapping into is not just scriptural principles but there's one objective in the life of the believer and it's jesus christ above everything else now i don't want you to get me wrong and my boys know they've heard me say this a number of times and they we have many pow wows not just at home and i don't mean powwows like wow wow come on ben you can say amen to that buddy but since these guys and all the things they come through talk about things responsibilities priorities listen how much you've got to keep on revisiting revisit them depends on which one you're talking about but all of them because when they get to be 18 years old or even 16 it isn't like checkout time my time is done no it's more time for me now than what it was before with everyone but brother samuel they're right here in the house of god but leadership is needed that's right are you hearing me i'm not going to go any further on that this morning right let me say any further from me i won't be here next sunday well if you're not here i'll have somebody else step up and preach but i've said this multiple times i would rather my boys be full of the holy ghost and be janitors not that a janitor is a negative thing you understand what i'm saying i'd rather than be on fire for god that's the number one objective in my life brother samuel how are you going to pay for their schooling he's jehovah jihad he's already proven that over and over again what are you saying don't sweat the small things we've got a great big god who's greater than all those things are you hearing me now i think i didn't like it when this state when they said hey man you know paul uh ben went in for that college credit plus and the state paid for two years two years of college and schooling his last two years of high school i think i mean i don't know if how much i dance that's a little bigger that's that's some money out of my pocket come on friends don't get quiet on me now there's some other things that i can you know in a different way i appreciate all that i mean you want to buy me dinner i appreciate that too now come on now but you wonder where am i where am i getting back to the priority and the focus is is i want them to know jesus christ i want them to be real men of god that are on fire with the holy ghost amen they've heard it from me over and over of even the things naturally in life there's going to be something you have to do in life whether you don't want to go if it's not if it's not college it's a trade that you take up we need people in the trades i've told them that we've sat down and talked but i said you've got to be real but the number one thing in your life is to be full of the holy ghost and i haven't just preached it to him i live it right i ain't bragging on me you understand but to me i want that's what my desire is so i say that to every parent that's in here the focus and the encouragement ought to be in the things of god that's true amen help me preach brother samuel in the things of god that should be the number one and if my focus is on thine house right then i receive the order from thine house for my house and we can stand like joshua and say as for me in my house we're going to serve the lord amen amen so you have to make that decision on your own if the word has shown up here this morning anything even in in your life and i'm sure the word of god as it's been spoken oh my it speaks to our lives throughout friends listen let's not walk away from here and let it just sit it'll do us no good amen you've got to act upon the word of god amen you've got to act upon what you're hearing if there's things that the mirror is showing in your life and and you're seeing it don't run from it run to it run to him who's opening and showing that pour your heart out to him no matter where you're at in your journey let it be satisfied in your heart that i am not going to be just a lukewarm right believer all right i'm not going to be just somebody that's just i'm not going to be satan's ragdoll come on friends amen this isn't put downs you understand me this isn't put down i'm letting you know you've got a source of strength that'll blow every devil out of your being there's a power here it's greater than an atomic bomb amen there's a power there's a source of strength that you and i have this morning david said the lord is the strength of my life what do i do partake of it partake of it maybe you're at repentance this morning partake of that listen if you haven't received the holy ghost don't just say well you know yeah i know i need to do that you need now not someday now is the day now is the moment now is the time amen now just put it off on some day you don't have a promise of tomorrow that's right we're in the rapture season right now now is the time well i wait well i you know when i get done with all this schooling then i i'll really get serious now is the time now is the time now is the time not later now and the mirror only shows right now if the mirror shows halfway say god i don't want to be a halfway christian amen you see what the mirror the mirror has not come to condemn are you hearing me now the mirror didn't come to condemn the mirror comes to show us our shortcomings that's what the mirror comes to do well brother samuel you know i keep looking in the mirror and that's all i i keep seeing and i i keep seeing all these these things were truly there's things wanting to pull me back well look into the mirror don't look into it and then go back to that and say but but this say god these things there's still some things in my heart let the holy ghost come down and burn it out lord look into the perfect law of liberty say god burn it out of my life i want to be an on-fire effectual fool of the holy ghost believer that's genuine amen now is the time not next week not tomorrow or the next service no now is the time now is the time over the same i i've let down you know i have you know i'm not as fervent as i need to be i've got cold in this chair cold in this area right now is the time to start putting wood on the fire everybody's saying i ain't got no wood going up to the mountain there's some cedars of lebanon that are there them cedars of lebanon have been purchased that it might build the house of god let me tell you every promise in the word of god has been purchased for you and i right what i have to do go take it amen well that's on an awful high shelf there's a ladder to get there but the way you go up this ladder you got to get down you got to get down on your knees and you can climb in prayer to wear those things that are up there on that shelf that you can have because you know what prayer is prayer is surrendering our will to god amen i'll say right now not tomorrow amen not the next day right now buddy robinson was in the field that day and said lord if you don't give me the holy ghost you're going to find a pile of bones right here when you come back what was it now amen now now well by saying that we're not to demand of god we're not demanding of god we are fronting the devil who's a bluff and we're letting him know these are our promises and god is calling me to this promise i got a call over into the promised land i got a call to that promise and that call didn't come from a man that call come from god there's a yearning in my heart for a deeper walk a closer walk a more consecrated walk that call didn't come from man that call came from god and we are the people of now [Music] we're not the part of wesley's age we're not the part of luther's age we're not the part of restoration of a gift we are all that plus now now this is bright time now this is holy ghost time now this is miracle time now this is rapture time now now now now amen anybody want to join with me [Applause] now's the day to claim back whatever the enemy stole from you right now is the time to take it back now is the time hallelujah oh glory be to god oh hallelujah oh glory be to god let's pray heavenly father you have spoken throughout this building lord you have lord god uttered your voice and it is a mighty voice father you are the god of now now is the day of salvation now is the time to receive the holy ghost now is the time for full deliverance now is the time of healing hallelujah father i pray you'd give courage if there's a heart lord god that's right here this morning that god has never went that far may they have courage to step out lord god may the lord god not be ashamed of you because you said who's ever ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of him there but we want to be identified lord with you here yes lord now lord just as much as they could look back to jerusalem it wasn't physically that they had to come back first but they had to get their heart returned back first lord the father i'm asking lord god this morning there's needs throughout this congregation and you lord god i stand as an ambassador lord of this life father we're standing here lord god challenging satan's hold challenging his hold upon lies challenging land that he would like to hold and keep on challenging him against his bluffs now father you're more than a match lord i'm identified with you there's believers right here identified with you now lord i pray that god that you'll come lord i pray this morning lord that you'll give courage that lord it might seem little like a little bit of faith but may it be like little david walking out this ain't my battle this is the lord's battle amen you've made your bluff satan you said you're going to feed me to the dogs you said i'll never be nothing i'll never be an effectual christian i've come in the name of the lord god has anointed my heart and i'm standing in under that anointing this morning to pour out my life and surrender and i'm gonna announce it your head's coming off victory is in the camp victory is here now is the time now is the day now is the moment an honest reflection where lord god as your children hearts that can stand and look in the mirror say god i need to be a little bit i need to be more fervent things that they can see that crept into their lives oh it ain't things lord god like dirty movies and things like that but the toils of life things have crept in and there's a and lord god through the pressures of life that focus has been turned on those other things but standing as a believer with the courage of my a courage that goes beyond natural courage i courage to stand out and say lord that word is truth lord god i agree with your word lord i'm not going to set complacence on the word of god i'm not going to be a hearer i'm going to be a doer of the word of god i want to see a change in my life glory i want strength i want to come back to that source of strength in my life i want to renew it hallelujah [Music] god may you give courage lord to hearts and lives this morning because every head is bowed i realize sometimes you know it's been said the longest walk that you'll make is the walk from your seat to the altar well brother samuel that altar itself it don't hold any virtue i realize that that all that this alter itself it doesn't hold any virtue but you're not coming here because of this altar i realize that the altar the prophet would say it one way in the revelation series it's in your mind where god meets you then he would come on down paragraphs below that and say it's in your heart where god meets you you see the reason even i know god can do things for you sitting right in your seat but what about courage right now this morning sometimes we set upon the things of god instead of moving i want a refreshing in my life [Music] lives and hearts that are gathered here no doubt some streaming need to be filled with the holy ghost need a full birth need a full working hallelujah maybe lives where you can look back and say oh brother samuel five years ago but it's not about five years ago amen it's not even about last month it's about where are you at right now amen where are you at right now remember his presence has not come to condemn you but he said as he said to john i am come to minister love courage ability and power that's what he's come to do hallelujah i encourage you by the holy spirit to seek him while it is amen let the spirit of god move down let him just move down in your life you're more than welcome to come up here to make a stand right up here to come and give your life but remember when you come if you come right here remember say god i'm identified in my heart i want a full consecration maybe it's a reconsecration i know you can do it right there in your seat too i'm not pulling you to an altar friends but i'm pointing you to the word the words brought conviction don't let don't walk out of here without addressing that conviction the holy spirit has brought conviction to deal with your heart you don't know this might be your last moments this might be the last sermon i'll ever preach i don't know but we want to take this opportunity now now he's a now
