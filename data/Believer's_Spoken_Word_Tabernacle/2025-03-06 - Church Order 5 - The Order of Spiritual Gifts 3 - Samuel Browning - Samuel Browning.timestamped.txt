[28:37] our
[29:00] sorry um I just I had I called uh
[29:05] brother brother Aaron and because uh I
[29:08] know even for him he at the first part
[29:10] of the week wasn't feeling too well
[29:12] either and but um I know there's some
[29:15] others that's not feeling well tonight
[29:18] and they're not here that normally would
[29:19] be here so as much as I hate to cancel
[29:23] the fellowship dinner um and uh it's not
[29:26] about the food believe it or not
[29:29] it's not about don't don't let your eyes
[29:30] tell you
[29:32] that but uh I I do love the food but
[29:35] we'll try to get it reschedule when we
[29:37] can I had been I'd had that in the back
[29:39] of my mind simply because of what we've
[29:41] kind of had going on here at the church
[29:42] and I know not we're not um just the
[29:44] only ones but uh there's different ones
[29:47] in other assemblies as well and we've
[29:50] had some where some people are just
[29:51] starting to get back and get over things
[29:53] as well so uh I think it's I really feel
[29:56] in my heart it's the best interest to to
[29:58] do that so we'll just try to reschedule
[30:00] that and uh if we can I know times and
[30:03] dates and things like that kind of get
[30:05] uh filled up so
[30:07] um if I can let me try to find somebody
[30:10] if you have a problem with it let me see
[30:12] if I can find someone that you can
[30:17] contact just uh but uh I I really hate
[30:20] to do that but I think it's in the best
[30:22] interest just to we get past this season

[32:28] people time doesn't change
[32:33] that's that only works at certain times
[32:35] right it's during the fallback that when
[32:37] it goes falls back we just don't tell
[32:39] some people we just let it just go just
[32:40] say hey time's the same you know but um
[32:44] I thought about that here today you know
[32:45] even with them the time change I was
[32:47] thinking as I was walking in the
[32:48] sanctuary and just praying and I thought
[32:50] my you know it just starts getting into
[32:52] that time of the year where we gain that
[32:54] hour here and then it'll be a little bit
[32:55] more Daylight and it keeps on going
[32:57] going as we're coming to church and I I
[32:59] really look forward to
[33:01] that if you're going to take my snow
[33:03] away give me
[33:06] daylight but this year because of the
[33:08] parking lot I'm I'm glad that the snow
[33:10] held off and I tell you I kept on
[33:13] looking out the window the other day the
[33:15] the days that I'm here I look at it is
[33:16] that snow drift out there is it getting
[33:18] smaller you know I almost wanted to just
[33:20] go out there and shovel it
[33:21] all but um anyhow I'm thankful that for
[33:25] the Lord's made a way for us amen we
[33:27] could be here tonight and so good to see
[33:29] each and every one of you and umen it's
[33:31] good to be a Christian isn't it it's
[33:33] good to be serving the lord and U so
[33:36] let's just look here in in the
[33:37] scriptures tonight I want to go right to
[33:38] 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and I'm going
[33:41] to
[33:42] just go a little bit more here in in
[33:45] this on the order of spiritual gifts
[33:47] tonight and
[33:50] um so in verse
[33:52] 27 uh Paul writes now you are the body
[33:56] of Christ
[33:58] and members in particular and God hath
[34:03] set some in the church first apostles
[34:06] secondarily prophets thirdly teachers
[34:10] after that Miracles then Gifts of
[34:12] healings helps governments diversities
[34:16] of
[34:17] tongues then he asked the question are
[34:20] all
[34:21] Apostles are all prophets and are all
[34:26] teachers are all all workers of Miracles
[34:31] have all the gifts of healing do all
[34:33] speak with tongues do all interpret but
[34:37] covet earnestly the best gifts and yet
[34:41] show I unto you a more excellent way how
[34:45] many know that more excellent way is to
[34:47] seek after The
[34:49] Giver Divine love that's that's that's
[34:52] greater that's greater than any any gift
[34:54] because that's what really gives it
[34:56] value and substance that's right amen
[34:58] that's that's where it really has the
[35:00] the density behind it and so that's even
[35:03] in in every and each of our lives so
[35:07] let's just go to the Lord in a word of
[35:08] prayer
[35:09] tonight Heavenly
[35:11] Father Lord I just know Lord that
[35:14] throughout the
[35:16] assembly as we would come
[35:19] together father there are many needs
[35:22] Lord that not only have already been
[35:23] mentioned and read and hands that have
[35:26] been uplifted and you know each one
[35:29] father you know our needs Lord and
[35:33] father you know just how to speak to our
[35:35] hearts and Lord even through these times
[35:39] moments Lord of even of teaching we have
[35:42] seen you Lord even last week how that
[35:44] you would so take things so personal
[35:47] Lord and father we lord as much as Lord
[35:51] just staying steadfast Lord in laying
[35:54] these things in but in everything father
[35:57] you you know every need if there's
[35:59] something Lord that would need to be
[36:01] mentioned or said then father may you
[36:03] give the unction for it if there's
[36:06] anything Lord that would not be pleasing
[36:07] or needful Lord may you just close my
[36:10] mouth and turn me from it Lord and I
[36:12] pray that you and all things here
[36:14] tonight Lord May our understanding be
[36:16] fruitful Lord by the spirit of God
[36:18] coming down and taking the word and
[36:21] breaking it to our hearts Lord we need

[36:44] strength and health and Lord we ask God
[36:47] for a protection Lord oh God that Lord
[36:50] for on our lives and our bodies Lord
[36:53] that even our systems might be built
[36:55] back up Lord we pray we know that
[36:57] there's nothing Lord that would be Lord
[37:01] Beyond in asking those things because
[37:03] even you said Lord through the Apostle
[37:06] John that you would that we would be in
[37:10] good health and that our health would
[37:12] Prosper even as our soul so we ask Lord
[37:15] that you'll just Lord not only touching
[37:17] Lord hearts and lives but God just
[37:20] granting Lord real Health Lord I pray
[37:22] father among your children Lord we love
[37:25] you and we thank you father in Jesus J
[37:27] name amen amen God bless you as you're
[37:30] being
[37:32] seated I want to just Journey here a
[37:35] little bit more tonight on this thought
[37:37] on the order of spiritual
[37:41] gifts and I want to as we look here in
[37:45] that opening scripture where it says God
[37:48] hath set in the
[37:50] church and uh you know you hear Brother
[37:54] Braham say it over and over in the
[37:56] message he says if God has put it in the
[37:59] church then he says no man has a right
[38:02] to take it
[38:03] out and if God placed it there there's a
[38:06] need for all of those things yes and
[38:10] it's just like as though when you
[38:11] remember a few weeks ago when I brought
[38:14] out all of those different utensils out
[38:18] of my office that I use at times stapler
[38:22] scissors knife even this that I use to
[38:27] sometimes just you know be able to you
[38:31] have that laser pointer that's up there
[38:33] you know I don't use that all the time I
[38:36] don't feel that every service I have to
[38:37] use this but if I find that there's
[38:40] something that maybe on a graph or
[38:42] something that I see that needs to be
[38:44] pointed out or maybe to try to draw
[38:46] attention on the slide to something then
[38:49] I'll do that and that's even when God
[38:51] has placed the nine spiritual gifts in
[38:54] the body it's not something that it has
[38:57] to to be or we we should have the
[38:59] feeling as though that certain things
[39:01] and this has to be uh it has to be you
[39:04] know every service or it has to be this
[39:06] way we just want to know that we're
[39:09] first of all we're in the body of Jesus
[39:12] Christ by the new birth that's what's
[39:15] important that should have been a louder
[39:17] Amen on that that's number one that's
[39:22] right if if we never had one
[39:24] manifestation of a gift Among Us that
[39:26] will not prevent the
[39:29] Rapture that's good that's good as a
[39:31] matter of fact brother Bram says and
[39:33] I'll read in another place in the
[39:34] message when he opens in 1963 church
[39:36] order he says this church he says is one
[39:40] of the most spiritual churches not
[39:42] because he said that we have the most
[39:45] speaking in tongues and gifts and they
[39:47] had it it's not because he said of all
[39:49] those things he said but it's the
[39:51] quality of the spirit that's among us
[39:54] and that quality of the spirit that's
[39:55] Among Us that's Divine love that's
[39:57] working that's why brother Bram would
[39:59] say over and over he said if I had an
[40:01] opportunity or I had the choice that God
[40:03] said would would you rather William
[40:05] brandham that I give you all of these
[40:08] nine gifts or I give you love he said I
[40:10] wouldn't even have to think about it I
[40:12] would ask him for divine love he said if
[40:15] he you know he laid out a lot of
[40:16] different criterias on things but it
[40:18] just it shows that's very much in the
[40:20] scripture how Paul was writing to the
[40:22] Corinthians and as I said here earlier
[40:24] that in some of the messages we often
[40:27] times the prophet will talk about that
[40:29] you know how that God uh through Paul
[40:32] never had to speak regarding these
[40:34] things to that of the uh Ephesians or to
[40:39] uh the Romans or the Thessalonians and
[40:41] Philippians and so forth but there's
[40:43] other things they had to be they had to
[40:45] be addressed in those churches and Paul
[40:49] actually touched a little bit there even
[40:50] in the Book of Romans but he never had
[40:53] to go into such a great uh elaborate way
[40:56] as he did here in the book of
[40:58] Corinthians but as I said before is that
[41:01] if if there are not uh circumstances or
[41:04] things that are before us that does not
[41:07] allow us to see and give us an example
[41:10] and how that God would come back around
[41:11] and bring correction you or I would be
[41:14] in a manner in this way we would have no
[41:16] writings on this at all but the spirit
[41:18] of God through through what was a
[41:22] weakness in that Corinthian Church but
[41:24] God came around and he used that and the
[41:27] spirit of God set everything in order
[41:30] and there was Victory and you say how do
[41:31] you know there was Victory how do you
[41:32] know that they grow from that just read
[41:35] second Corinthians when you read second
[41:37] Corinthians this is not mentioned see
[41:40] between first and second there's they
[41:42] grew and what what was it the word they
[41:45] had to trust the word of the Lord beyond
[41:48] their
[41:49] feelings they had to trust when Paul uh
[41:53] When Paul placed them the the
[41:54] Corinthians it's very evident they were
[41:56] taken very much with the Supernatural
[41:58] and as a Believer we we are born of the
[42:02] supernatural you love the supernatural
[42:04] but the thing of it is is that within it
[42:07] all there there is there are the right
[42:10] things that we are to be seeking after
[42:12] and that's
[42:14] him we don't ever you know one thing
[42:16] about it we don't have to push we don't
[42:18] have to Prime we don't have to try to
[42:20] figure out you know you know one thing
[42:22] within it you know sometimes you might
[42:24] have heard you might hear a minister say
[42:26] my I got better get busy I I I got to
[42:28] you know look at what I'm going to speak
[42:30] well in
[42:31] reality the things of it is is how God
[42:34] will sovereignly drop there's a lot of
[42:36] things that even as a minister that I
[42:39] can have a I have a lot of different
[42:40] studies and things that would be going
[42:43] but yet it's it's what what does the
[42:46] Holy Spirit say that is needful for
[42:51] right now that's good that's good
[42:53] there's some things that even throughout
[42:54] this week he's really turned me and then
[42:56] even to Day for Sunday that really just
[42:59] coming back around on some things that
[43:01] just just pressing from the beginning of
[43:03] the week and where we're at and we want
[43:05] to be mindful it's it's things that just
[43:07] to be um yielded to the holy spirit so
[43:11] we don't have to we don't have to the
[43:13] one thing that I want to just say to you
[43:16] and for everything within our hearts and
[43:18] our lives is we don't have we don't ever
[43:22] want to walk by
[43:25] Impressions we don't want impressions
[43:27] the prophet is very clear maybe if I
[43:29] have a service I'll take that on that
[43:30] and and we don't want to enter into
[43:33] anything with a manner of is that oh as
[43:35] I said before last week where oh I see
[43:38] this in the church and I think this
[43:39] needs to be spoken to that's carnal
[43:42] right there because even as a even as a
[43:45] minister there are things that as your
[43:48] pastor look as the pastor I see the
[43:50] things I see the things that not even
[43:52] out here but God will reveal sometimes
[43:54] the way God will reveal certain things
[43:56] to me and other times there's things
[43:58] that I have no idea about you know I
[44:00] don't I don't go asking him Lord reveal
[44:02] me everything I just know this I got
[44:04] confidence in the word the gift is there
[44:06] I got confidence in the Lord he knows
[44:08] what we need I don't have to know I
[44:09] don't have to know every situation as a
[44:11] matter of fact I like it when I don't
[44:12] know it but there's times God would
[44:14] speak to me sometimes he's done that by
[44:16] dreams sometimes he's done it with other
[44:18] things and you know as you just wait on
[44:20] the Lord you watch the word and
[44:22] sometimes I've watched God take text
[44:25] that I that I would never have guessed
[44:27] that that text is what was going to meet
[44:29] the need and sometimes the very things
[44:31] that you don't see it out there but if
[44:33] you only seen and you could see inside
[44:34] of me up here and see everything is all
[44:37] all moved around and and here I am
[44:39] standing here and yet God would take a
[44:41] service like that that you feel like
[44:43] scrambled eggs would be would be a plus
[44:45] compared to that and God will work right
[44:47] through that you know God has a sense of
[44:48] humor yes he does he has a sense of
[44:50] humor and I'm glad about that you know
[44:52] God has such a way of just letting us
[44:53] know hey it's me it's me it's not you
[44:57] it's me it's me he has a way aren't you
[45:01] glad I I love being humbled that
[45:05] way so we we just want to look at this
[45:08] and I want to say if God said it in the
[45:10] church we certainly we do not want to be
[45:13] guilty of taking it out right right uh
[45:16] and and we don't have to prop it up we
[45:18] just have to be available in the body
[45:21] filled filled with the spirit of God and
[45:23] our hearts submitted to the word of God
[45:25] and God will work I like how brother
[45:27] says this in 1954 he says there's many
[45:29] gifts over here in the Methodist Church
[45:32] there's many over in the Baptist Church
[45:34] if it was only preached so the gift
[45:38] could go to
[45:40] operating remember brother Ram was a
[45:42] Baptist pastor he had all the gifts in
[45:44] the church and he had them even to a
[45:46] place to where he wanted to get them
[45:47] back to in the Tabernacle where they
[45:49] were meeting in a little room brother
[45:51] Braham had that there and that's where
[45:52] he kind of chided the Pentecostals he
[45:54] said if God would do that for a Baptist
[45:57] pastor among Baptist people he said what
[45:59] would God do among the Pentecostal
[46:02] people so the prophet knew where where
[46:04] he was going with he's the prophet of
[46:06] the age and watch I I love how he says
[46:08] this if you put a seed in the ground and
[46:10] don't cultivate it what's going to
[46:12] happen to it it will lay there in dry
[46:14] dust and rot it'll do no good these
[46:17] gifts have been in the church all along
[46:19] but just now the waters Begin to Fall
[46:22] the Pentecostal rain to water it and
[46:24] bring forth fruit now use it in the
[46:28] right place so it wasn't the very thing
[46:32] remember you hear Brother Bram say over
[46:33] and over always said if I could just we
[46:35] could just you know teach on this and we
[46:37] could just set the tent up or all these
[46:39] things and he just he wanted to do that
[46:41] and you say well why didn't he why
[46:43] didn't he do that at the Tabernacle he
[46:44] did do it at the Tabernacle as a matter
[46:46] of fact he went through and I purposely
[46:49] in these slides throughout the times
[46:51] even have left in there where these
[46:54] messages were preached and I've done it
[46:56] for this reason is so you can see it is
[46:58] the prophet for the age and the prophet
[47:02] is a Divine interpreter of the word it's
[47:06] setting the church in order not just the
[47:08] local church it's to set the Church of
[47:11] the Living God in order and that's why
[47:13] brother brandham when he takes that
[47:14] message the church order he doesn't just
[47:17] say to brandham Tabernacle he says but
[47:18] to the Church of the Living God the body
[47:21] of Jesus Christ and so when we look and
[47:25] seeing this of how that God has placed
[47:28] it here within within the church we know
[47:32] that even within things Paul would write
[47:34] about how that it should be uh something
[47:38] that would be of a certain sound it
[47:39] should give direction it should give uh
[47:42] it should it should be very clear it
[47:44] shouldn't be something that's vague now
[47:46] Paul was writing this even in regards to
[47:49] just you know if if people just came in
[47:52] and everybody was just speaking in
[47:54] tongues and Paul said you know they'll
[47:56] come in and say you're all mad but he
[47:58] goes in to say of that the very thing
[48:01] that that should be the focus is that of
[48:04] Prophecy because and it's evident when
[48:06] Paul would say that he he didn't he's
[48:09] when he speaks of that because in the
[48:11] order of the gifts wisdom is actually
[48:14] the highest gift there
[48:15] is and that's why that Paul would write
[48:18] that wisdom and knowledge because as
[48:20] brother Bram says if you don't have
[48:21] wisdom and knowledge how you going to
[48:23] know to operate those things but see God
[48:25] has set wisdom has come down into the
[48:27] church and that wisdom that God has sent
[48:30] down into the church is the very thing
[48:32] that's spoken of in the Book of
[48:33] Revelation where it says herein is
[48:36] wisdom God has sent God has sent a
[48:39] prophet and that that even working that
[48:42] through a prophet's life it begins it
[48:44] puts the church in order and giving us
[48:47] the leadership and direction that we
[48:49] need so it must come with a it must be a
[48:52] certain sound not something that's
[48:54] that's uncertain and anything that
[48:56] doesn't ring true with the word of God
[48:58] is an uncertain
[49:00] sound everything is to be judged by the
[49:03] word of God everything every Spirit
[49:07] every feeling is to be judged by the
[49:09] word of God and when I say the word I'm
[49:12] not just even talking about the letter
[49:14] how be it we we want we go by the letter
[49:17] but it's also the character of it it's a
[49:20] spirit of it it's a things that's behind
[49:24] it so notice notice in the scripture
[49:27] here it says if the whole church become
[49:30] together into one place and all speak
[49:32] with tongues and there come in those
[49:33] that are unlearned unbelievers will they
[49:36] not say you're all mad but if all
[49:38] prophesy and there come in one that
[49:40] believeth not or one unlearned he is
[49:43] convinced of all he is judged of all and
[49:47] thus are the secrets of his heart made
[49:50] manifest and so falling down on his face
[49:53] he will worship God and report that God
[49:56] is in you of a truth and I just want to
[50:00] say it in this way we there's a lot of
[50:04] substitute but we want
[50:07] real am I I don't think anybody wants a
[50:10] substitute Holy Ghost you want the real
[50:13] Holy Ghost you don't want a substitute
[50:17] experience you you you want an
[50:19] experience that's real that goes down to
[50:21] your
[50:23] soul if I had had an opportunity and and
[50:27] here you there were fake $100 bills and
[50:32] real $100 bills don't get too excited
[50:34] real $100
[50:37] bills you know if you're not careful
[50:39] remember the substitute will look very
[50:42] will look very
[50:44] close right it's not going to be when
[50:47] you've studied the real and you know the
[50:50] real well let's say somebody from
[50:51] another country they may not know what
[50:53] the real $100 bill looks like so to them
[50:57] it could be some things it could be just
[50:58] off and they haven't studied it they
[51:00] haven't seen it so it'd be pretty easy
[51:02] to pull off the
[51:04] counterfeit but this is why that Satan
[51:07] he's a deceiver yes he's not somebody
[51:10] that we to be afraid of see we're not to
[51:12] be afraid of him we have a word that God
[51:16] has given to discern it and to judge
[51:20] it just like it comes down to our
[51:23] decisions if you just step back for a
[51:24] minute decisions that you have in your
[51:26] life Life coming in your life or on you
[51:28] don't have to be afraid even though they
[51:30] can be momentous decisions life altering
[51:33] changing so forth decisions but trust in
[51:36] the Lord and the Bible says acknowledge
[51:39] Him in all thy ways and he shall direct
[51:42] thy footsteps that pass so we we have a
[51:44] place of confidence that we can go to
[51:46] we're not
[51:48] alone and So within this of when I say
[51:52] that of real and substitute brother BR
[51:54] says in Jehovah Gyra 6 one in Long Beach
[51:57] he says we don't have to take a
[51:59] substitute the Pentecostal skies are
[52:02] full of the genuine why take something
[52:05] that's bogus when there's a real one
[52:07] make it real then there's no slip UPS
[52:11] right now he goes on to to speak of this
[52:14] here in that message and he's talking of
[52:16] how that in in this message how that
[52:20] there are are things that even when the
[52:23] message would be coming forth and I'm
[52:24] talking about in tongues interpret ation
[52:26] he says he said by discernment he says
[52:29] you can tell he said some of it is
[52:31] purely flesh and how many of you know
[52:33] brother Bram was was a real
[52:36] gentleman yes and see when I'm studying
[52:39] these things the things that I'm looking
[52:40] for purposely even as I've gone through
[52:42] some of the things that I brought to you
[52:44] last week I'm looking at where where
[52:47] where this is being said is it being
[52:49] said outside of the Tabernacle or is it
[52:51] being set inside the Tabernacle because
[52:54] brother brandham brother Bram you'll
[52:56] you'll find one thing that brother Bram
[52:57] never said and I I'll get into this in a
[52:59] later time brother Bram even cautioned
[53:01] us he said don't be calling something of
[53:04] the
[53:04] devil that's he said you reverence it he
[53:08] said too many times we as humans we
[53:11] misjudge things yeah sometimes it's by
[53:14] appearance sometimes it's by looking at
[53:17] like like brother BR says you could say
[53:19] well that that person's a hypocrite he
[53:21] says you don't judge whether it's true
[53:25] based on the person whether they're a
[53:26] hypocrite or not you judge the spirit
[53:29] right that's so good right see that's
[53:32] that that's where that's why the brother
[53:34] BR I'm when I'm saying that I'm looking
[53:36] at a character we we're trained and God
[53:39] is revisiting these things but it's
[53:40] looking at it very carefully that there
[53:43] are not things that we're just just
[53:45] simply just just you know just coming
[53:47] out say well that that that's that's of
[53:48] the devil it's of the devil when it's
[53:51] proven
[53:55] false that's when when there's an evil
[53:57] spirit that's got
[53:59] in now you might say well I can tell
[54:03] many quotes I can give you and I will at
[54:05] a later time where brother Bram says I
[54:08] can't
[54:09] tell I've got them I'm you know I'm not
[54:12] just saying things that are out there he
[54:13] says he he says I I can't I can't judge
[54:16] that now this is where you understand
[54:18] that for the Prophet The Prophet was not
[54:20] one and I want to say this in the right
[54:22] way the prophet of God was not one and I
[54:25] want to say this in a way that it's I'm
[54:27] trying to get it very clearly he did not
[54:29] have donuts with the angel of the Lord
[54:32] every morning so true and if you want to
[54:34] quote on that yes sir brother Brown
[54:36] tells us when remember when the little
[54:38] lady that she was suffering from that
[54:40] anxiousness and all those things like
[54:42] that he did not know what was her
[54:44] problem but he says when the angel of
[54:46] the Lord comes to my home I'll send mey
[54:49] to get you brother Bram says a few days
[54:52] had went by m week or whatever more and
[54:54] when the angel of the Lord he told me to
[54:55] go get and bring her
[54:58] here and even when he was Walking in
[55:00] Memphis he didn't know why the plane was
[55:03] grounded he has he has he just what are
[55:05] we going what are you going to do he
[55:07] doesn't know that and he even said as as
[55:09] I quoted that to you he walks up to the
[55:11] mailbox even when he's dropping the
[55:13] letter in and he asked in himself is
[55:16] this just an
[55:19] impression same way when he was about
[55:21] ready to step over into Israel and he
[55:24] kept being pressed kept being pressed
[55:26] and finally he pulled back into the
[55:28] little air the airport The Hanger where
[55:30] the where the the planes are at took off
[55:32] his hat and said Lord is that you that's
[55:34] talking to
[55:36] me why it's trying every Spirit we don't
[55:41] take it by
[55:42] feelings so good we don't even take it
[55:44] by just one statement when I when I'm
[55:46] looking to study in the message even
[55:49] there's things that can be dropped as a
[55:50] thought I do not take thoughts and run
[55:53] with
[55:54] it because the devil can give thoughts
[55:58] yeah it's got to be proven out through
[56:00] the word when I got see it proven we're
[56:03] working it right through the word of God
[56:05] right through the message of the hour
[56:07] right through you can see it working out
[56:10] amen amen the urum must
[56:14] speak Hallelujah is that all right yes
[56:17] it is now he says it he says if there
[56:21] wasn't a message same same message I'm
[56:23] quoting from if there wasn't a message
[56:25] directly to somebody like that it was
[56:28] flesh and we didn't accept it at all so
[56:31] if it wasn't something that was directly
[56:33] to someone he says now what if I come
[56:36] here now watch how he's opening this up
[56:38] what if I come here and I said the Lord
[56:40] tells me somebody's got kidney trouble
[56:43] he said how many's got kidney
[56:49] trouble sure it's all over the building
[56:52] I've seen that so impersonated of a gift
[56:54] of God somebody tells me the Lord tells
[56:58] me Hallelujah I feel it's nervous
[57:00] somebody in here is nervous sure the
[57:02] whole crowd
[57:04] is no that's not
[57:07] it who is notice he's directing who is
[57:11] who is nervous who who and where did
[57:15] they come from what caused it and what's
[57:19] going to be the outcome you say brother
[57:21] Samuel that would take a profit now
[57:27] that gift that operated on the platform
[57:30] was that of the prophet of God for the
[57:33] hour and a prophet is not to be judged
[57:38] right but a gift of Prophecy which will
[57:42] work in the same exact manner is to be
[57:47] judged by two or three before it's
[57:53] received I'll get into this later on
[57:55] this is where brother br says the error
[57:57] that came among the latter room the
[57:59] latter rain
[58:02] movement so how many believe God is that
[58:06] direct oh yeah and I have to I have to
[58:09] kind of clarify a few points my wife and
[58:11] I we were uh just you know
[58:13] fellowshipping you know with these
[58:14] things and she she pointed out to me and
[58:17] my memory was a little bit I guess a
[58:19] little foggy there and you know I like
[58:21] the thing I got a good memory I I I
[58:24] listen if my memory goes on other things
[58:26] as long as I can remember the message of
[58:28] the hour and God brings those things
[58:29] back to me and I'll take it but some of
[58:32] the things she said honey she said the
[58:34] other night she said God has called
[58:36] names right in this
[58:38] assembly she said and I forgot about
[58:41] this she said he actually called dad's
[58:44] name in that message I was referring to
[58:47] last week when we were in the other
[58:48] place and it called him mountain and it
[58:50] was about you're at your kades
[58:52] barnea and of course then he was at the
[58:54] altar right then wow it called out the
[58:57] name and then there's others that you
[59:00] know that that has been it's been called
[59:02] right out where the spirit of God would
[59:04] would come and now if I want you to
[59:06] catch this that's something that is so
[59:08] direct at that moment a person
[59:12] knows you understand some the person
[59:15] knows but if but what's different when
[59:18] when in judging is that if it's says and
[59:20] brother Brown we use these examples
[59:22] there is a lady that's going to be
[59:24] coming to church she's got a green scarf
[59:25] she's from Ohio she used to be a treasur
[59:28] of a church she stole some money out of
[59:29] that and in order for her to be
[59:31] delivered of that cancer she needs to
[59:33] make that
[59:34] right see what's it for it's not
[59:37] embarrassment it's to help her
[59:40] right right when we talk when brother
[59:42] bam talks about that of ananas saf
[59:45] remember even the prophet himself he
[59:47] tells us this in Christ The Mystery of
[59:49] God revealed when he's dealing with that
[59:51] of the discernment on the platform he
[59:52] said you have to watch it he said
[59:53] because it could cause penitentiary
[59:55] offens
[59:58] with things being
[1:00:01] uncovered what wisdom see see it's not
[1:00:05] just the things that are being said
[1:00:06] through the message of the hour it's a
[1:00:08] character it's a character that that's
[1:00:11] what that's what we want to make sure is
[1:00:12] is the character we can have all of the
[1:00:15] words just right we got to make sure we
[1:00:16] get the character and I'm not talking
[1:00:18] about the character of William Bram I'm
[1:00:20] when I see that within William Bram I
[1:00:23] recognize that the same Holy Spirit
[1:00:25] lives in me then I've Got Confidence
[1:00:28] that what that portion that pertains to
[1:00:31] me to you will produce the same
[1:00:34] character
[1:00:35] amen are you with me cuz he didn't have
[1:00:38] a bigger portion of the Holy Spirit and
[1:00:40] you've got a smaller portion remember
[1:00:41] God has divided and God operated through
[1:00:45] that
[1:00:47] gift is that right glory be to
[1:00:52] God so with that portion and this is a
[1:00:54] little side note with that portion of
[1:00:56] the Holy Spirit operating through that
[1:00:59] of brother brandham and stood right
[1:01:02] there and stood face to face with the
[1:01:04] Enemy over and over look he's the same
[1:01:06] God for you and for me within every
[1:01:08] situation we just got to trust him Lord
[1:01:11] You're a way maker you're the one Lord
[1:01:12] to open up the way of I I maybe not know
[1:01:15] how to turn here I don't even know how
[1:01:17] to get myself out of this or that but
[1:01:18] Lord I'm trusting in you for greater is
[1:01:22] he amen that is in me amen than he
[1:01:26] that's in the
[1:01:28] world Amen it's a confidence in God now
[1:01:31] notice he says if not he said that's
[1:01:33] just carnal impersonation it's carnal in
[1:01:36] the sight of God why accept that when
[1:01:38] there's a real one why do that when
[1:01:41] there's a genuine now let me just say it
[1:01:43] in this
[1:01:44] way there are things and I we'll get
[1:01:47] into this later that yes things there's
[1:01:49] things that at times where things can
[1:01:51] start in such a baby way and and brother
[1:01:55] around him even for himself just letting
[1:01:57] things kind of grow and letting it build
[1:01:59] and so forth there's an objective in
[1:02:01] line I I don't think any parent here
[1:02:05] still would would rather have well I
[1:02:08] don't want to say that because maybe
[1:02:09] some of the mothers would say yeah I
[1:02:10] would rather they be in pamper so I can
[1:02:13] I don't have to worry about them and you
[1:02:15] know they're 45 and I got to tuck them
[1:02:16] in their bed and you know I understand
[1:02:18] that but but but but I don't think
[1:02:21] anyone any parent here once their once
[1:02:24] their children dis they would stay just
[1:02:27] just back there the whole time but
[1:02:28] there's a there's a there's a there's a
[1:02:30] desire to see them grow and in order for
[1:02:32] them to grow they're going to make
[1:02:34] mistakes you know you you you can't put
[1:02:37] you know styrofoam over all your walls
[1:02:39] and walk around and everywhere instead
[1:02:41] of carpet we're going to take bubble
[1:02:42] wrap and put it down just in case you
[1:02:44] fall stairs no more stairs we're going
[1:02:46] to just cut the top part of the house
[1:02:48] everything's going to be
[1:02:50] downstairs no more sharp edge
[1:02:53] tables we'll just use blow up little
[1:02:55] tight
[1:02:57] tables but we understand as much as we
[1:03:00] can with parameters we know there's got
[1:03:02] to be growth and sometimes sometimes
[1:03:05] that growth it comes through learning it
[1:03:07] comes through mistakes it comes through
[1:03:09] those things just like here in the book
[1:03:11] of Corinthians where we can step up and
[1:03:13] we can teach those things
[1:03:16] however however we want to cultivate the
[1:03:20] cultivated and not just let things
[1:03:23] go because a child left himself you know
[1:03:27] any person just left in God takes a word
[1:03:30] and he cares for that word he wants to
[1:03:32] see that word come to
[1:03:34] maturity and so when we're looking at
[1:03:37] this here you would look and say well
[1:03:39] why would people be we drive be going
[1:03:43] after uh uh something that wasn't
[1:03:46] genuine sometimes it's
[1:03:50] because of a person feeling or
[1:03:52] congregation or Pastor if they have that
[1:03:55] that I tell you our church we've got it
[1:03:58] there's gifts there's speaking in
[1:04:00] tongues there's prophecy boy we got it
[1:04:03] and they're wanting now I let me just
[1:04:05] let me let me phrase a little bit here I
[1:04:07] don't say that people are wanting to be
[1:04:08] an error but sometimes it's wanting
[1:04:11] something so bad as though that that's a
[1:04:13] source of vindication tongues and
[1:04:16] interpretation and all of this is no
[1:04:19] source of vindication that's good that's
[1:04:23] so good remember the evidence of the
[1:04:25] Holy Ghost has always been the same and
[1:04:29] that is receiving the word for your
[1:04:32] dayall the prophet said you may never
[1:04:35] speak in tongues you may never shout you
[1:04:37] may never run you may never and he goes
[1:04:39] on and let your light so shine on and on
[1:04:41] and on but he says your life will be
[1:04:44] changed and see that's your resting
[1:04:47] place because there's times you don't
[1:04:49] feel like a Christian but that does not
[1:04:52] define you hallelujah hallu hallelujah
[1:04:56] that's good preaching come on
[1:05:00] now that's right that's so
[1:05:04] good I'm just going to I need to move on
[1:05:06] because there's some things I could say
[1:05:07] that I've had to deal with where
[1:05:09] individuals you know here in prayer
[1:05:11] brother Samy I want to I want you to
[1:05:12] pray the Lord will let me do this no I'm
[1:05:14] I'm not going to pray for that let's get
[1:05:16] down to what what is this what's going
[1:05:18] on CU we're not chasing after things we
[1:05:21] we we want to get settled on the word of
[1:05:24] God a might run one time and never run
[1:05:27] again or they might do this and never
[1:05:28] run again but there there is a place
[1:05:30] where we can be settled in God
[1:05:34] hallelujah hallelujah and you say how do
[1:05:36] I know that that settl is a revelation
[1:05:39] in your heart that you know I'm not the
[1:05:42] same person that I used to
[1:05:44] be and let me tell you something that
[1:05:47] when everything around you is giving way
[1:05:49] that's an anchor that holds within the
[1:05:52] Veil
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:56] [Applause]
[1:05:57] that's something that if you could not
[1:05:59] even walk your feet you could not run or
[1:06:02] you maybe wouldn't even be able to raise
[1:06:03] your hands but youve got a joy that
[1:06:06] pulsates in your soul that I know in
[1:06:09] whom I have believe and I am persuaded
[1:06:13] he is
[1:06:14] able that's my sacred
[1:06:17] sand that's my portion that's my
[1:06:21] inheritance that's the safety zone right
[1:06:24] there devil you got any question let's
[1:06:27] go to the sacred
[1:06:29] sounds right Hallelujah let's go talk to
[1:06:33] my
[1:06:39] father thank you Lord that was free
[1:06:42] that's
[1:06:44] good don't you like those free things
[1:06:46] that come I do I
[1:06:49] enj but notice I I want to just kind of
[1:06:52] work with this here a little bit and out
[1:06:55] of that direct message let me read just
[1:06:57] a few more statements the prophet makes
[1:07:00] he says God don't use vain repetitions
[1:07:02] that's from the
[1:07:03] scripture he doesn't use that quoting
[1:07:06] scripture he's already done that he
[1:07:09] asked us not to do the same it's
[1:07:11] something definite for somebody in the
[1:07:15] church for a purpose he says it's saying
[1:07:20] something directly to be interpreted for
[1:07:23] a certain person in that congregation or
[1:07:25] something to make a way now we looked at
[1:07:29] that last week that sometimes there's
[1:07:31] needs where somebody needs even choosing
[1:07:34] between a job choosing between what to
[1:07:36] do that's right right now we are not
[1:07:41] going to say that that answer is going
[1:07:43] to come through tongues prophecy or some
[1:07:47] defined Channel but it was is going to
[1:07:49] come according to the
[1:07:50] word and we just want to be sensitive
[1:07:53] for however the answer comes
[1:07:55] right I mean you you know it's like I
[1:07:57] don't have my cell phone up here but my
[1:07:59] cell phone's active I just got off the
[1:08:00] phone with brother Aaron I know it's
[1:08:02] active I still see all the bars up there
[1:08:04] I see all that you know how it is when
[1:08:05] you your cell phone you go into certain
[1:08:07] places and you realize I don't got no
[1:08:08] signal here
[1:08:10] right and and you go in there you oh my
[1:08:12] goodness I need to get out of here I
[1:08:14] don't have no signal so you get out of
[1:08:15] there the main thing is is just make
[1:08:17] sure that you're in range of the
[1:08:20] tower he's a strong and mighty tower
[1:08:23] just make sure that if there's anything
[1:08:25] that's in the way like sometimes in my
[1:08:27] home if I get if I'm down in the
[1:08:29] basement or something or whatever more
[1:08:31] all of that aluminum duck work and
[1:08:32] everything else it's send things Haywire
[1:08:34] you have to say hey hold on just a
[1:08:35] second hey I'll move this over here
[1:08:37] sometimes the airpods are they get
[1:08:39] Haywire what you know what you have to
[1:08:41] do you don't look at the phone and say
[1:08:42] well the phone's not working you realize
[1:08:45] I need to get where I can be to hear the
[1:08:48] reception and that's why you say hold
[1:08:52] on come on sometimes what it is the
[1:08:55] tower hasn't
[1:08:57] moved it's us sometimes that has moved
[1:09:01] away from the
[1:09:03] tower because God's still sending
[1:09:06] Visions FaceTime he's still sending text
[1:09:09] messages God is still in communication
[1:09:13] with his
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:16] people amen and
[1:09:19] amen Prophet said it must be a direct
[1:09:21] message to the church or or we would
[1:09:23] think it would be flesh we we see some
[1:09:25] much of that he said I believe the
[1:09:26] spirit was to speak only for the
[1:09:29] edifying of the church now let me let me
[1:09:33] I want to read here just a uh a few
[1:09:35] things I wanted to play one here for you
[1:09:37] but um you know Brian wasn't here
[1:09:40] tonight and we'll shoot him
[1:09:44] later with rubber
[1:09:46] bullets no I I just I didn't want to
[1:09:49] it's it's a longer message I was going
[1:09:51] to play for you uh as far as where at
[1:09:53] the End of the saman Age Maybe what I'll
[1:09:55] do is just send it to you and you can
[1:09:57] start and listen because it goes to the
[1:09:59] end of the message it's about seven
[1:10:01] minutes long or whatever but there's in
[1:10:03] that message there's three after brother
[1:10:05] Braham has preached the samonian church
[1:10:07] age there's three different sets of
[1:10:09] tongues interpretations tongues
[1:10:11] interpretations tongues interpretations
[1:10:13] and it it comes right back down through
[1:10:16] and it's speaking so pointedly doesn't
[1:10:18] call anybody's name but it's speaking so
[1:10:20] pointedly and the spir and and the
[1:10:22] prophet said he said now watch how
[1:10:24] orderly that is has come right after the
[1:10:26] word that's the first thing it's coming
[1:10:28] Its Right season and he said notice it
[1:10:30] was three messages he said and it was
[1:10:33] calling exactly according to the what
[1:10:35] the word had come forth and for hearts
[1:10:37] and he said here stands three Sinners
[1:10:40] wow Lord and then brother Bram goes on
[1:10:43] he said did you also hear how it said he
[1:10:47] said of how that we need to stop the
[1:10:50] foolishness and he's talking about just
[1:10:52] little things about our life and and
[1:10:54] circumcising let the spirit of God
[1:10:55] circumcised now I want you to notice it
[1:10:57] wasn't when brother brandham was
[1:10:59] referring to that this is this is in
[1:11:01] Jeffersonville this one I'm quoting from
[1:11:03] so this isn't like he's out in Long
[1:11:05] Beach or he's down in Clarksville and
[1:11:08] you say what would that make a
[1:11:09] difference because brother brandham was
[1:11:11] a gentleman when he was out even when
[1:11:14] people interrupted him that's right
[1:11:17] that's true let me tell you how much a
[1:11:19] gentlemen I'm not lifting brother bam up
[1:11:20] I'm talking about the character of even
[1:11:22] how we should approach these things yes
[1:11:26] we don't just jump in and well this is
[1:11:27] of that and this brother bam even when
[1:11:29] when it jumped in it cut in right in the
[1:11:31] middle and you hear this multiple times
[1:11:33] and there's a time where it cuts right
[1:11:35] in while he's preaching and brother B
[1:11:37] says oh he says it must be something
[1:11:39] very very urgent very important for the
[1:11:41] Holy Spirit to cut into the message like
[1:11:43] that now you know and I know we've
[1:11:45] already been through the scriptures
[1:11:46] enough the spirit of the prophets is
[1:11:48] subject to the prophets that person was
[1:11:50] out of order but you see what it was
[1:11:53] they had not been taught
[1:11:55] right right and that's what brother
[1:11:57] brandham would say even when that even
[1:12:00] when the one sister was jumping up you
[1:12:01] know each time that an alter call was
[1:12:03] being made and finally on the second
[1:12:05] night he told her to sit down and he
[1:12:07] didn't do that by just a knowledge of
[1:12:09] the word what he said when he said sit
[1:12:13] down because what was happening is is
[1:12:15] she through that was interfering with
[1:12:18] souls coming to the
[1:12:19] Altar and when brother Brandon remember
[1:12:21] he got followed out there to the car and
[1:12:23] the ministers and he says all the these
[1:12:25] women were around me oh you you messed
[1:12:27] up tonight said how do I mess up by
[1:12:30] staying with the word oh she had
[1:12:31] something fresh from heaven and and you
[1:12:34] were finished and brother Bram says I
[1:12:35] wasn't finished I was giving the altar
[1:12:38] call Hallelujah the altar call is still
[1:12:41] part of the word coming
[1:12:44] forth and he teachs what he said he said
[1:12:47] look he says I understand he said and
[1:12:49] for you preachers he spoke to them who
[1:12:51] came to the car he said the reason this
[1:12:53] is is because you have your people and
[1:12:56] he said there will be an accounting for
[1:12:58] the souls that were missed in this
[1:13:01] meeting wow you see how important it is
[1:13:05] absolutely to think about those things
[1:13:07] you say well brother Samuel with with
[1:13:09] the blood of Jesus Christ but remember
[1:13:11] every one of us must appear before the
[1:13:14] Judgment seat of Christ yes sir yes sir
[1:13:17] and give account not the white Throne
[1:13:19] the Judgment seat and give an account
[1:13:21] for the Deeds Done in the
[1:13:24] body so I want you this this is why it's
[1:13:27] so careful it's things that that lady as
[1:13:30] I said before brother Bram didn't even
[1:13:32] brother Bram didn't even say you know it
[1:13:34] was a devil and this that he never said
[1:13:35] that no as a matter of fact what brother
[1:13:38] Bram was pointing out he was just
[1:13:39] dealing with how that was coming out of
[1:13:41] order in the hindrance of what it was
[1:13:43] and so when you're looking at times of
[1:13:45] where a direct message and I you know
[1:13:48] it's things that we want to just rest
[1:13:51] upon that part to know that God indeed
[1:13:54] is direct Direct in what in what he's
[1:13:56] saying God is direct he doesn't God
[1:13:58] doesn't have to as I just read that to
[1:14:00] you out of Jer out of Jehovah Gyra God
[1:14:03] doesn't have to hem and haul and beat
[1:14:05] around the bush and you know somebody in
[1:14:07] here is nervous tonight or somebody's in
[1:14:08] here God of no no God does God doesn't
[1:14:11] work that way it's it's got to come
[1:14:13] direct there's a message that would be
[1:14:15] given like brother Brandon would say it
[1:14:17] in in this way let me let me see if I
[1:14:19] can find one here he says now let me
[1:14:21] just I I've got it listed here but I
[1:14:23] want to just read the one
[1:14:25] he says here in in time evangelism I I
[1:14:28] read this to you last week but he says
[1:14:29] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[1:14:31] not knowing Tong's interpretation just
[1:14:34] went forth that someone somewhere that
[1:14:36] you spoke to a heart somewhere and it
[1:14:38] called back again even in the closing
[1:14:40] message it said and it called them your
[1:14:43] children because you had called to them
[1:14:46] maybe they had just been fixing to walk
[1:14:48] away without receiving you and then the
[1:14:51] message comes again speaking of the
[1:14:53] tongues interpretations so we pray
[1:14:55] heavenly father that you will great a
[1:14:57] grant a great portion of your spirit
[1:14:59] upon whoever the person may be you never
[1:15:02] called their name you just spoke it and
[1:15:05] father maybe that's the way you want it
[1:15:08] and we just pray father that your your
[1:15:10] that that your will be granted to this
[1:15:12] person or these persons whoever they may
[1:15:15] be that it may be coming down to a final
[1:15:17] call those messages sometimes speak
[1:15:21] someone we don't know who they are
[1:15:24] sometimes they tell who they are but
[1:15:27] just someone in here that maybe just
[1:15:29] started to move away without
[1:15:33] it it's something that registers as
[1:15:36] brother Bram goes through there's other
[1:15:38] that I referred to and in the one I
[1:15:39] wanted to play for you out of the
[1:15:40] Sumerian age brother brandham has has
[1:15:43] called that and he said how how the
[1:15:44] response it was so it was it was not a
[1:15:47] vain repetition it was not something was
[1:15:48] vague it was so pointed how the Holy
[1:15:50] Spirit was
[1:15:51] speaking and I spoke even it was just it
[1:15:54] was incredible cuz I'm speaking you know
[1:15:55] at times you know and and it's it's one
[1:15:58] of those things even you hear you know
[1:16:00] other with other pastors and other
[1:16:01] ministers where things within that way
[1:16:03] that to me that's not strange that those
[1:16:06] things would would take place and they
[1:16:07] would happen in that way but I want us
[1:16:09] to be able to say it in this way that
[1:16:11] one thing for sure even in that we want
[1:16:14] to know that we're hitting the
[1:16:17] Marken we want to know we're hitting the
[1:16:19] mark because this notice Let me let me
[1:16:22] just move on here a little bit it comes
[1:16:23] by course and mo at most three by course
[1:16:27] and when it says by course in the
[1:16:28] scripture here it says let it be two or
[1:16:31] at the most three and that by course and
[1:16:34] let one interpret and brother BR says
[1:16:36] you you even hear him in the message
[1:16:37] when he's sometimes that tongues has
[1:16:39] come about and all of a sudden you know
[1:16:41] the the the people and brother B says
[1:16:43] just be quiet he said let's let's wait
[1:16:44] let's be in prayer let's wait for the
[1:16:46] interpretation to come because he said
[1:16:50] you can't have you can't have the
[1:16:51] speaking in tongues and then have
[1:16:53] another speaking in Tong another
[1:16:55] speaking tongues he said it by course
[1:16:57] it's tongues interpreter tongues
[1:16:59] interpreting tongues interpretation if
[1:17:01] it's going to be three he says it it it
[1:17:05] it comes forth in that way you find
[1:17:06] there was one message I was studying
[1:17:08] here or looking at here just the other
[1:17:11] the other evening and brother Bram it
[1:17:12] just comes in that way and brother Bram
[1:17:14] says when things happen like that where
[1:17:16] it was just like rapid of different ones
[1:17:18] with tongues and then all of a sudden
[1:17:20] here here interpretation was coming and
[1:17:21] brother brah is telling us he says when
[1:17:24] when things happen in that way it's
[1:17:26] confusion it's
[1:17:28] confusion now remember what we looked at
[1:17:31] last week brother brah says when the
[1:17:34] that gift of interpretation he said when
[1:17:36] that sets down it's just like that of
[1:17:38] tongues he said interpretation he said
[1:17:41] this is what he says questions and
[1:17:42] answers God being misunderstood and I
[1:17:44] recommended that message to you if you
[1:17:46] haven't listened to that message go back
[1:17:48] and listen I've just been combing
[1:17:49] through that questions and answers God
[1:17:51] being misunderstood brother BR says too
[1:17:54] often
[1:17:55] interpretation is done out of an
[1:17:57] extraordinary
[1:17:58] Expression A
[1:18:01] Feeling
[1:18:02] what the spirit wants to say and brother
[1:18:05] BR says that is
[1:18:07] wrong he takes us back as we went and
[1:18:09] looked at it in the scripture the
[1:18:12] interpretation it can be like we said
[1:18:14] last week it could be like if if little
[1:18:17] Aaron here he speaks an Africans I don't
[1:18:19] know it you know Africans don't you I
[1:18:21] don't know it but I could tell you if he
[1:18:23] speaks in it and the gift of
[1:18:24] interpretation strikes me I don't need
[1:18:26] to know Africans I will hear it in my
[1:18:29] own
[1:18:30] language sir the same God who anoints
[1:18:34] him or someone else to speak in that
[1:18:36] language is the same God that will
[1:18:38] anoint to hear it in my native
[1:18:41] tongue that is so good I don't have to
[1:18:45] know how to because this is not a
[1:18:46] fleshly thing this is the spirit of
[1:18:48] God right so now when we look at this
[1:18:53] it's by it's by cour and notice how when
[1:18:56] the scripture says let the prophet speak
[1:18:58] two or three and let the other judge and
[1:19:00] if anything be revealed to another that
[1:19:02] said it by let the first hold his peace
[1:19:06] for ye may all prophesy one by one that
[1:19:08] all may learn and may be
[1:19:11] comforted and notice when we have this
[1:19:15] brother B says if there was already
[1:19:17] three messages gone out in unknown
[1:19:19] tongues in one meeting this is a
[1:19:22] question if that's already happened
[1:19:24] brother Brown in the prayer line can
[1:19:26] there be more messages go out and still
[1:19:29] be in the spiritual order of the
[1:19:31] meeting brother Bram goes into this here
[1:19:34] just stay with me now whatever it is
[1:19:36] what Paul is speaking of is a message of
[1:19:39] uh to the congregation out there let it
[1:19:41] just be by three because the message of
[1:19:44] God is speaking a message trying to get
[1:19:45] it over to the congregation so those
[1:19:48] scriptures I just read are to the
[1:19:52] congregation but now he's asked the
[1:19:54] question what about in the prayer
[1:19:58] lines brother BR says when the man in
[1:20:01] the prayer line he's prophesying to an
[1:20:04] individual not the whole if that would
[1:20:07] be so if if in other words if three
[1:20:10] messages already gone and you couldn't
[1:20:12] do it no more I'd be out of order all
[1:20:13] along in my prayer lines when 30 or 40
[1:20:15] of them in a night if you're prophesying
[1:20:17] to an
[1:20:18] individual now let me just say it like
[1:20:21] this that's judged right away
[1:20:26] prophecy coming forth and it's coming
[1:20:29] forth somebody coming through a prayer
[1:20:30] line and these things are mentioned and
[1:20:33] if someone at that point says that's not
[1:20:36] true somebody is
[1:20:38] lying and let me just tell you to you it
[1:20:41] don't matter how much The Minister's
[1:20:43] track record could be 10 out of 10 that
[1:20:47] is no
[1:20:48] Vindication are you hearing me he's not
[1:20:50] a
[1:20:51] prophet we got quiet in here now these
[1:20:55] are things we're seeing and then what
[1:20:57] I'm saying is is that when there are
[1:20:59] things within it well I I I see you know
[1:21:01] look God works in that way and you see
[1:21:03] how Satan wants to do sometimes Satan
[1:21:05] don't want to come and try to discredit
[1:21:07] things this is why everything has to be
[1:21:11] judged and if someone comes back and
[1:21:13] says with their parents hey this wasn't
[1:21:16] right right there that should be
[1:21:19] repented of
[1:21:21] right right either either the person is
[1:21:25] they're not telling the truth or this
[1:21:27] person it should it should never be of
[1:21:30] you you do but you just don't know it
[1:21:32] that they we don't need that that's
[1:21:35] right there is
[1:21:37] genuine yes amen are you hearing me
[1:21:39] there's genu
[1:21:41] wine and we're going to take we're going
[1:21:43] to take everything that God has and
[1:21:45] we're not going to come into a place and
[1:21:47] you know go to acting as though Co is
[1:21:49] all over again and
[1:21:52] oh oh get away from me you're looking at
[1:21:54] me I don't want no J we're not going
[1:21:56] into that with the gifts we don't have
[1:21:58] to be
[1:22:00] afraid we have to reverence
[1:22:03] them and bringing according to the word
[1:22:07] is that right and nobody nobody's above
[1:22:09] the
[1:22:10] word nobody no matter name whatever
[1:22:13] nobody's above the
[1:22:15] word you with me you made a prediction
[1:22:18] and things didn't have come to pass
[1:22:20] repent and get
[1:22:23] right and say you know what I had the
[1:22:25] had the wrong feeling about this or had
[1:22:27] this get it
[1:22:33] right BR goes on he says now for ex
[1:22:35] instance the prayer Line's called and
[1:22:37] brother Neville or myself or any other
[1:22:39] minister goes down to this individual
[1:22:41] that's not to the body that's to this
[1:22:43] individual and the spirit of God comes
[1:22:46] upon him to tell this individual tell
[1:22:48] something now remember brother Neville
[1:22:51] had had had had a gift of Prophecy with
[1:22:54] works through his life as well as
[1:22:56] tongues and that of interpretation and
[1:22:58] he said cuz he's not speaking to the
[1:23:00] congregation it's to this individual and
[1:23:03] brother Brandon remember brother brand
[1:23:04] made the statement and I read it to you
[1:23:06] last week out of Gabriel Gabriel's visit
[1:23:08] to Daniel 70 weeks and brother Bram made
[1:23:12] that statement of how when he was asked
[1:23:13] is there going to be any more
[1:23:14] discernments and he says no he says
[1:23:16] brother Neville's here with that now and
[1:23:17] I got some
[1:23:19] relief you remember that from last week
[1:23:21] he said I've got some relief he said I
[1:23:23] can rest when I'm at home
[1:23:25] now but that working of gift of Prophecy
[1:23:30] was not something that could just it was
[1:23:34] not the same as what it was in brother
[1:23:36] branham's life because when brother
[1:23:38] branham's life it wasn't a gift of
[1:23:40] Prophecy it's a
[1:23:42] Prophet this is why I working that over
[1:23:45] and over and see this is where sometimes
[1:23:49] these things I want to say it in this
[1:23:52] way sometimes things we can become
[1:23:53] enamored with things sometimes we can
[1:23:56] become dependent on
[1:23:59] things this is what brother Brandon was
[1:24:02] speaking remember his burden and as I
[1:24:04] was with Moses it's not just that
[1:24:05] message in 1960 in September but you'll
[1:24:07] hear it over and over he's because what
[1:24:09] he's saying is is where the people
[1:24:11] instead of taking hold of the word of
[1:24:13] God they're waiting for Brother randam
[1:24:16] to say something right they're waiting
[1:24:19] and let's just be honest friend let's
[1:24:20] just cut to the chase if you and I were
[1:24:23] there we would have been in the same
[1:24:25] place the only reason we are where we
[1:24:27] are right now and God has to give us
[1:24:29] nudges and Grace is because of the word
[1:24:31] and the word working and we're seeing it
[1:24:33] working and moving in our life because
[1:24:35] to tell you the truth if God hadn't
[1:24:37] taken his Prophet off the scene this
[1:24:38] church wouldn't be here
[1:24:41] probably that's right we'd probably be
[1:24:43] loading up going to Jeffersonville every
[1:24:45] weekend or wherever it was at see God
[1:24:48] knows what he's doing but you see
[1:24:51] sometimes it can become a
[1:24:53] dependency we can become dependent on
[1:24:55] somebody else instead of waiting on God
[1:24:58] ourselves now God can use a multitude
[1:25:02] God God can use God can use any of the
[1:25:05] gifts God can use come right through the
[1:25:07] ministry of the word God can come right
[1:25:09] in your prayer
[1:25:10] closet we we're not putting God in a
[1:25:14] box but at the same time we we have to
[1:25:17] understand see notice the whole part of
[1:25:19] the message of the hour is bringing us
[1:25:21] to a dependency on the word of
[1:25:26] God yes sir Hallelujah to where it's
[1:25:29] like oh no cell phone service is down
[1:25:31] how am I going to get a contact with
[1:25:33] this person how am I going to do this I
[1:25:35] need to know what to do I I need to talk
[1:25:37] to this
[1:25:38] person we need to talk to
[1:25:41] God there's a relationship with God now
[1:25:45] I I get it we at times you can have
[1:25:47] confidence but this is what I'm this is
[1:25:48] what I'm pointing to the dangers of
[1:25:51] dependency it can get to such a place to
[1:25:54] where you go to pray for somebody and
[1:25:55] they're saying is God showing you
[1:25:57] anything about my life I know what I'm
[1:25:58] talking about friends that's why I'm
[1:26:00] dealing with this is God showing you
[1:26:02] anything about me is God doing this you
[1:26:04] know what's happening it's builds it can
[1:26:07] build a dependency and yet people are
[1:26:08] not intending to do that
[1:26:11] even what what's the whole point is to
[1:26:13] recognize who's Among Us are you with me
[1:26:17] I know when I'm talking about I'm not
[1:26:18] these are not shots in the dark I know
[1:26:20] what I'm talking about
[1:26:21] here another the message Paradox brother
[1:26:24] says I had to take I had a word from the
[1:26:27] Lord to take to brother Neville about
[1:26:28] prophesying over everyone that comes by
[1:26:31] this altar here God God told him and
[1:26:34] really called him down about
[1:26:36] it I think we know the result did he
[1:26:39] receive the
[1:26:40] correction he did which showed it was
[1:26:43] the real spirit of God the whole
[1:26:45] time don't do that you'll don't watch
[1:26:48] watch don't do that you'll shove him out
[1:26:52] in the flesh and then you'll have a
[1:26:54] false prophet wait a minute you mean
[1:26:56] it's not brother Neville's fault brother
[1:26:57] Neville the gift but people are wanting
[1:27:00] things what is this and they're wanting
[1:27:02] they're pulling they're pulling and here
[1:27:04] he is standing prophesying over every
[1:27:06] single one that's coming
[1:27:09] by I'm glad this transparency aren't
[1:27:12] you and you know what as a matter of
[1:27:14] fact brother bram's on the platform or
[1:27:16] brother Neville's on the platform well
[1:27:17] even then that's in Jeffersonville but
[1:27:19] he's on the platform even when he reads
[1:27:21] this next one in 1965 brother BR says
[1:27:23] let him do as the spirit leads him to do
[1:27:26] don't try to pull nothing out of God cuz
[1:27:30] you can't do it trying to do God a
[1:27:34] service without being in his will what a
[1:27:36] title how I had to catch our own little
[1:27:38] Pastor here on it out here in the woods
[1:27:40] one morning about 3:00 in the morning
[1:27:42] and he said go tell brother Neville I
[1:27:45] come to you didn't I brother Neville
[1:27:48] everybody this is what everybody was
[1:27:50] doing brother Neville prophesy over me
[1:27:52] tell me this or that
[1:27:54] he said you see what you'll have him
[1:27:56] saying things then that wouldn't even
[1:27:57] come to pass they that wait to find out
[1:28:02] what the Lord wants to do see if we're
[1:28:05] not careful then it becomes traveling
[1:28:08] all around the country to find this one
[1:28:11] particular
[1:28:12] person or two people or three people if
[1:28:14] I can just get to them why would you
[1:28:17] have to get to a person I know God uses
[1:28:19] men that is so good but Jesus said lo I
[1:28:23] am with you you
[1:28:26] always are you hearing me you hearing me
[1:28:29] God's God's not taking us backwards in
[1:28:31] time God's given us his word and
[1:28:34] building our confidence in who it is
[1:28:37] that is Among Us and who is it that's in
[1:28:41] our
[1:28:42] lives am I saying that God cannot lead
[1:28:45] somebody and and they go here and go
[1:28:47] there that's not what I'm saying at all
[1:28:49] but what I am saying is that don't put
[1:28:52] anybody as your holy ghost or anybody as
[1:28:56] your spiritual
[1:28:59] crutch God did not BR send a message to
[1:29:02] have people rally around one man or a
[1:29:05] certain Ministry we are to Rally around
[1:29:08] the gift of God and the gift of God is
[1:29:11] the Holy
[1:29:15] Ghost Hallelujah that's then brother bam
[1:29:17] says I preached the biggest name there
[1:29:19] is the Lord Jesus
[1:29:22] Christ Hallelujah that was brother
[1:29:24] Bron's problem with voice of healing he
[1:29:27] said in there he said they're getting
[1:29:29] too much about pointing to the man on
[1:29:31] the testimonies and everything else he
[1:29:33] said I hear them they're talking too
[1:29:34] much about the man and I did this and
[1:29:37] this and that he said they need to be
[1:29:38] more bragging on the Lord Jesus
[1:29:42] Christ you said did Brother brandom live
[1:29:44] that ask those that was with
[1:29:47] him brother Hoover stood right here his
[1:29:51] grandma was in the home as as the as the
[1:29:54] as the you know the one who cared for
[1:29:56] the children and the one thing that she
[1:29:58] said she said when brother randam talked
[1:30:01] about the meetings he spoke of it in
[1:30:04] third
[1:30:06] person I happened to be there when I saw
[1:30:09] him do this and this I seen him do this
[1:30:13] and this you see to me those are little
[1:30:16] details that's within that there very
[1:30:19] key because it's after all it's him that
[1:30:21] receives the glory amen amen
[1:30:24] so there's a judging and a qualification
[1:30:26] method here let me just try to I want to
[1:30:29] want to hurry but yet I want to move
[1:30:31] through this and it says let the prophet
[1:30:34] speak two or three that's that's the
[1:30:35] interpretation coming from the tongues
[1:30:37] and let the other judge brother Brown
[1:30:40] tells us in church order and many other
[1:30:42] places it just I I I selected out of all
[1:30:45] of
[1:30:46] the quotes that I'm going through
[1:30:49] brother Bram says here must be men or
[1:30:52] peoples in the building in people who
[1:30:55] are spiritually solid in gospel Doctrine
[1:30:58] who has good discernment of spirit that
[1:31:01] would raise up and say it's of the
[1:31:04] Lord now brother Brown tells us in
[1:31:06] Gabriel's same place that I was quoting
[1:31:08] about brother Neville brother Braham is
[1:31:11] he's coming back and you know he's
[1:31:12] wanting to he's been watching things
[1:31:15] moving and he's wanting to he's wanting
[1:31:18] to to to put the things into a into a
[1:31:21] better into a more in order
[1:31:24] and he keeps on dropping that that that
[1:31:27] hint all along so he makes this
[1:31:29] statement and he says regarding the
[1:31:31] messages this is just one of the ways as
[1:31:33] it's taken down these messages are
[1:31:36] proving out to be of God because they
[1:31:38] are actually not coming out of order
[1:31:40] they're just set in order now that's one
[1:31:43] thing they're coming in
[1:31:46] order now the next thing he says my
[1:31:49] neighbor Mrs Woods same message who has
[1:31:52] a microphone hooked up here and a tape
[1:31:54] back there to take the meeting just
[1:31:57] purposely to get those messages and
[1:32:00] write them down and see whether they're
[1:32:03] right or
[1:32:06] not that's how she's checking them and I
[1:32:09] know Mrs Woods to be an honest woman and
[1:32:11] she's telling me of many things that's
[1:32:13] been said are coming to
[1:32:16] pass I I'm drawn to this statement many
[1:32:20] things because brother bam in a later
[1:32:22] part of the message he said
[1:32:24] sometimes only
[1:32:26] half but he said many things very a
[1:32:30] gentleman see because eventually we're
[1:32:33] going we we bring it brother Bram knew
[1:32:35] where the the Target and the direction
[1:32:37] was to bring to bring these things to
[1:32:40] now I want you to think of this here the
[1:32:42] scripture in Joel chapter 2 it said it
[1:32:45] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[1:32:47] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh how
[1:32:49] many you thankful for the Holy Ghost
[1:32:51] amen how many you thankful for what it's
[1:32:53] done in your life life changed you amen
[1:32:56] this is this is the promise that God
[1:32:58] made that he would pour it out but we
[1:33:00] also know and understand that it's
[1:33:02] poured out upon All Flesh and your sons
[1:33:06] and your daughters shall prophesy that's
[1:33:08] that that's part of it your old men
[1:33:09] shall dream dreams and your young men
[1:33:11] shall see visions and also upon the
[1:33:14] servants and upon the handmaids in those
[1:33:16] days will I pour out my spirit what's
[1:33:20] what's the most important thing is that
[1:33:22] that spirit
[1:33:24] has made its way down to our soul that's
[1:33:27] the new birth not just on our
[1:33:31] spirit not just not just on our our
[1:33:33] intellect but down to the soul to where
[1:33:36] it has changed us and we have passed
[1:33:38] from Death unto life the love of God is
[1:33:41] what's preeminent in our lives now
[1:33:45] notice within this the judging and
[1:33:47] importance and purpose let me just try
[1:33:49] to to tie this I'm I'm coming down here
[1:33:51] everybody okay just just a few more
[1:33:54] moments
[1:33:55] here because you man look and say well
[1:33:57] judging well I see it by the scripture
[1:33:59] what's the importance and what's the
[1:34:00] purpose like even in we have these
[1:34:03] microphones hanging through here why why
[1:34:06] would that be important as I said
[1:34:09] sometimes there's things it's it's right
[1:34:10] then and there right during the service
[1:34:12] and it's known I want you to
[1:34:15] understand do you think brother bam was
[1:34:17] putting this in place to have gotcha
[1:34:20] moments do you think that's what judging
[1:34:22] was all about like I dare you to to say
[1:34:24] something
[1:34:25] wrong I tell you and brother brandham he
[1:34:30] says it in one place here in the message
[1:34:31] he says somebody came to me he says when
[1:34:34] I started instructing in that way and
[1:34:35] they said H you're putting us too much
[1:34:37] on the spot and brother Bram says where
[1:34:40] do you think I'm at every
[1:34:42] night I'm right on the spot every
[1:34:44] night every night remember it's the same
[1:34:48] God working through the prophet and a
[1:34:51] gift of Prophecy a gift to prophecy is
[1:34:54] to be
[1:34:55] judged now brother BR says now before it
[1:34:58] can be given to the church I want you to
[1:35:00] listen to this it has to be judged by
[1:35:01] two or three witnesses that is a man who
[1:35:04] has discernment of spirit because a lot
[1:35:06] of times evil Powers gets in there Paul
[1:35:09] spoke of it but God's power is in there
[1:35:11] too tell me a congregation where evil
[1:35:14] doesn't
[1:35:15] set bwt 1530 Lake Breeze Road you're
[1:35:20] lying Prophet tells us and remember Job
[1:35:23] chapter one when the sons of God came
[1:35:25] together guess who else came Satan said
[1:35:28] pardon me that's my that's my Pew right
[1:35:30] there I need to sit down that's my spot
[1:35:32] this is where I always sat when the sons
[1:35:35] of God
[1:35:36] gather so s Satan's not exempt from this
[1:35:42] meeting but I want to remind you there's
[1:35:44] more with
[1:35:47] us the angels of God are right here
[1:35:50] among us as a matter of fact they have
[1:35:52] been the ashers
[1:35:54] here
[1:35:56] tonight glory be to
[1:35:59] godo tell me a congregation where evil
[1:36:02] doesn't set tell me where the sons of
[1:36:03] God are gathered together that Satan
[1:36:05] isn't in the midst of them it's
[1:36:07] everything future home 1964 let the mind
[1:36:10] that was in Christ be in you let the
[1:36:12] mind that was in Christ be in you then
[1:36:14] it isn't your thinking it's his thinking
[1:36:17] through you and you're not expressing
[1:36:20] your own words you're expressing his
[1:36:22] words brother BR remember in the quote I
[1:36:23] read to you last week he ties that right
[1:36:25] in to tongues and interpretation what's
[1:36:28] the next statement that's how many times
[1:36:30] the Brethren gets confused on
[1:36:32] interpretation of tongues and things
[1:36:34] they say things that's not right and
[1:36:36] they don't realize that that's Satan now
[1:36:39] what was brother BR what is brother Bram
[1:36:41] talking about is when there's things
[1:36:42] that said that's totally
[1:36:45] contrary remember how many remember when
[1:36:47] when brother Bram stood there in Chicago
[1:36:49] Illinois and all them ministers they
[1:36:52] remember they were setting a trap for
[1:36:53] him by God had explained and brother B
[1:36:55] tells us how many of them had made a
[1:36:59] commitment they were weeping Reaching
[1:37:01] Across and shaking hands and said they
[1:37:04] were going to come and be
[1:37:07] baptized what got in the way tongues
[1:37:10] interpretation at a later
[1:37:12] time brother B also tells us of of of
[1:37:16] also things were individuals things
[1:37:18] would be stood up oh this tongue's an
[1:37:20] interpretation took place and it told me
[1:37:22] told this one I've got the the wrong
[1:37:23] wife and I'm supposed to have this
[1:37:25] brother's wife and this brother Ram goes
[1:37:26] into that yes he does as a matter of
[1:37:29] fact you might think that is something
[1:37:30] that's so forign I talked to a man on
[1:37:32] the phone that called
[1:37:35] me just two years
[1:37:37] ago he's just come out of one of the
[1:37:40] sect the sect you know that's down there
[1:37:42] beard and things like that came out and
[1:37:44] he began he called me and he said he
[1:37:45] said I got your number he said and told
[1:37:47] me of a situation that had happened very
[1:37:50] much like that because why they are
[1:37:52] enamored with the gifts
[1:37:55] right
[1:37:58] enamored I said and the situation that
[1:38:01] he told me it broke my heart you say
[1:38:04] what did you do took him right to
[1:38:05] Matthew 24 you got your Bible open up to
[1:38:07] Matthew 24 I'm not breaking any
[1:38:09] confidence because you don't know who in
[1:38:10] the world it is you've never even seen
[1:38:11] the man don't worry he's never been here
[1:38:14] you don't even know him but I'm just
[1:38:16] trying to tell you of these certain
[1:38:18] things like this that would take place
[1:38:20] where this is said regarding this and
[1:38:22] this and that it's confusion and that is
[1:38:24] against the word of
[1:38:27] God are you with me that's the obvious
[1:38:29] that that's the obvious those are things
[1:38:31] that right here among us as a people of
[1:38:33] God it it should not and would not be
[1:38:37] that that is so obvious but notice what
[1:38:39] the brother Ram says here and you say in
[1:38:42] the garden of
[1:38:44] God this could take place in the garden
[1:38:47] of God remember our protection is the
[1:38:51] word of God right
[1:38:54] that's our walls 1964 brother Bram can
[1:38:57] Satan use the gift of tongues or
[1:38:58] prophecy in a person who has the Holy
[1:39:01] Ghost brother BR said that's a good one
[1:39:04] it must
[1:39:06] be watched very very
[1:39:14] close he goes on and says in 1
[1:39:16] Corinthians 1429 we find out that any
[1:39:20] gift in the church has got to be judged
[1:39:22] first now that's an incredible any
[1:39:26] gift now does that mean we're walking
[1:39:28] around with
[1:39:29] clipboards let me see here that's not
[1:39:31] what it is at all God has not put this
[1:39:34] for things to be tightened up where our
[1:39:37] toes are tightened up in our shoes but
[1:39:39] it is also for our protection as much as
[1:39:41] the gifts are such can be such a
[1:39:44] blessing as God sees fit to use them
[1:39:48] these can also be some of the things
[1:39:50] that can cause some of the greatest
[1:39:52] confusion and
[1:39:56] hurt I say Lord I just want you to be in
[1:40:00] control I just just want to just want to
[1:40:02] be work with that to watch watch very
[1:40:05] closely
[1:40:07] watch any gift in the church is got to
[1:40:09] be judged first you have to watch cause
[1:40:11] evil spirits slip in remember the rain
[1:40:14] falls on the just and unjust and the
[1:40:16] rain that was sent to ripen the weed
[1:40:17] also ripens the weed the same water God
[1:40:20] has a law and in this law is the spirit
[1:40:23] Spirit of life you have to watch because
[1:40:26] Satan slips
[1:40:28] in
[1:40:31] now every time and every spirit is to be
[1:40:36] judged brother Bram says it like this he
[1:40:39] says this is where the little breakup
[1:40:40] that come amongst the Pentecostal people
[1:40:42] here recently called the latter rain
[1:40:45] that's where they got off the line right
[1:40:47] there for when a gift of Prophecy come
[1:40:49] to a man they declared him to be a
[1:40:52] prophet that's wrong there's quite a
[1:40:55] difference between a gift of
[1:40:57] Prophecy and a
[1:41:01] prophet brother BR works with that over
[1:41:03] and over if you look right into
[1:41:06] that once again it doesn't matter
[1:41:10] judging is not based on track
[1:41:14] records judging is not based on well I
[1:41:17] don't I tell you I I know I I know that
[1:41:19] I know that I'm right on because of this
[1:41:20] this and this and it's all past no we're
[1:41:22] judging not the past that's the past
[1:41:25] right now present it's present it's not
[1:41:29] based on track record see a prophet a
[1:41:33] prophet it's thus sayeth the Lord a
[1:41:35] prophet is not judged right the word of
[1:41:38] God is what lays that out but a spirit a
[1:41:41] gift of Prophecy is to be judged every
[1:41:44] other spirit is to be judged so in other
[1:41:46] words it's not something that even our
[1:41:49] our faith where our faith is to be built
[1:41:52] is in God God and even with things as it
[1:41:55] comes like I said to be judged it's not
[1:41:57] based on track record I don't care if
[1:41:59] it's been 10 out of 10 times before this
[1:42:01] is a new
[1:42:04] time everybody with
[1:42:07] me this is this is the word of God is
[1:42:10] our
[1:42:11] protection it's things that we look at
[1:42:14] do we yes do we believe in it yes these
[1:42:16] things where I'm speaking is to
[1:42:17] cultivate it is to look at it but at the
[1:42:19] same time we're not here to run after
[1:42:22] any of these things
[1:42:24] these are many of these things as I told
[1:42:25] as I told shared with you before I've
[1:42:27] been on my heart for some time with
[1:42:29] things sometimes I see and and just
[1:42:31] looking at and and just my heart just
[1:42:33] being moved and and you see things that
[1:42:36] that that can be taking place and um but
[1:42:39] you know what I'm I'm speaking for here
[1:42:43] of how that we operate
[1:42:45] here through that of the word God would
[1:42:49] give us Grace so that there's a place
[1:42:50] that even as a people we can even refer
[1:42:53] back
[1:42:54] to messages taken it right out of the
[1:42:57] right out of the message and coming
[1:42:59] through those things and you know what
[1:43:00] there's more than just tongues and
[1:43:03] interpretation there's more there's more
[1:43:06] gifts than that and you know what we
[1:43:08] want we want all that God has for us we
[1:43:10] don't have to put him we don't have to
[1:43:11] put anything in the cause it that's not
[1:43:13] what judging does let me just tell you
[1:43:14] friends brother Bram and if somebody
[1:43:16] feels a little nervous don't worry
[1:43:17] brother Braham talked about one time
[1:43:19] when interpretation came to him and he
[1:43:20] didn't interpret he said it came back
[1:43:23] back around he said I didn't
[1:43:24] interpret and he said I didn't interpret
[1:43:27] and what was coming to me was to tell
[1:43:29] the pastor to pray for the sick and he
[1:43:31] said I didn't interpret it the second
[1:43:33] time he said and all of a sudden I look
[1:43:34] around I hear a p that Pastor stands up
[1:43:36] and begins to go praise it thank you
[1:43:39] Lord because of the seriousness and the
[1:43:42] reverence this is why that with
[1:43:45] everything within our lives and our
[1:43:48] hearts within all of us because the
[1:43:49] prophet said it can move he said it can
[1:43:51] move throughout the body we're in the
[1:43:54] body any one of these gifts can move
[1:43:56] throughout the body it may have
[1:43:57] frequency at times with others but it
[1:43:59] can move throughout the body and this is
[1:44:01] why it's always in a place as I
[1:44:03] mentioned I mentioned this to you some
[1:44:04] Services ago when I talk to the
[1:44:07] Musicians when I talked to talk to song
[1:44:09] leaders and so forth one thing I'm
[1:44:11] always very clear on is make sure your
[1:44:14] spirit everything is
[1:44:16] clean don't bring anything in if you
[1:44:19] listen it should it's not just about
[1:44:21] playing it's not just about leading
[1:44:22] songs listen you don't want anything in
[1:44:24] your heart period because you don't know
[1:44:25] when your your cards
[1:44:28] up matter of fact you don't even want to
[1:44:29] walk into the Church of God with
[1:44:31] something in your heart against somebody
[1:44:32] else because you can hinder the Holy
[1:44:35] Spirit you want to be a
[1:44:37] vessel that is also that's always
[1:44:40] available a life that's available for
[1:44:43] God to move and a
[1:44:46] character that wouldn't cause someone to
[1:44:50] question are you hearing me not question
[1:44:53] question see that's that's a stewardship
[1:44:54] that every one of us have over our own
[1:44:58] lives it's a responsibility that we have
[1:45:01] of our own lives I say oh God help us
[1:45:04] you love him
[1:45:06] tonight I hope
[1:45:08] through I'm off here and there but I I
[1:45:11] hope it's I hope it's
[1:45:13] clear and you don't have to say it is if
[1:45:15] it isn't just but you have a time that
[1:45:17] don't worry there's things that if you
[1:45:19] as I told you when I get some uh come to
[1:45:22] a certain in place that you have
[1:45:24] questions write them down who knows the
[1:45:26] answer might come before we we have a
[1:45:28] questions and answers on this but uh but
[1:45:30] I want you to uh I want to be able to
[1:45:33] have that time as I told you last week
[1:45:34] to do that so let's just let's stand if
[1:45:37] we could and
[1:45:49] uh and I trust I trust that
[1:45:54] there things that no matter because God
[1:45:57] God has gifts in the body we see things
[1:45:59] and God has all of that God has placed
[1:46:03] to help and it has been a
[1:46:06] help but the ultimate with every
[1:46:08] confidence and with everything it always
[1:46:10] comes back to the word of
[1:46:13] God and that's something that you know I
[1:46:16] tell you what I thank God if God seen to
[1:46:19] it and there was a need and I needed a
[1:46:21] word I needed a direct word that way
[1:46:23] maybe it was to come through a
[1:46:25] certain certain manner a certain way I
[1:46:28] would thank go I thank God for that that
[1:46:30] God would deliver that word to my heart
[1:46:32] so I'm not Li we're not limiting God
[1:46:35] we're not limiting
[1:46:36] God but neither neither do we just want
[1:46:40] to just just leave anything just open
[1:46:43] and just as it go we know that God's
[1:46:45] given us a word if we operate within
[1:46:47] that of the
[1:46:49] word God will lead us right God will
[1:46:52] Direct us I got confidence in that don't
[1:46:55] you God will direct us he'll lead us
[1:46:58] within it that's what that's what's
[1:47:00] important because listen friends we
[1:47:02] could have all
[1:47:04] across this whole church tongues
[1:47:07] interpretations tongues interpretations
[1:47:10] and if it doesn't meet that right there
[1:47:12] then it's been nothing but
[1:47:17] carnality it's been nothing but things
[1:47:19] that is just where it it there's no
[1:47:21] there's no profit to it
[1:47:23] there's no there's no profit to it these
[1:47:26] are the things that within it that all
[1:47:28] of this Lord we we just want to be
[1:47:32] available and you know what I believe
[1:47:35] when brother brandham was dealing with
[1:47:36] some of these things there was such a
[1:47:38] place that brother Bram could see you
[1:47:40] know what there's things that sometimes
[1:47:42] people would go after or chase after or
[1:47:44] you know why they want to move of
[1:47:46] God but you know what David wanted a
[1:47:49] move of God
[1:47:50] too but go he had to seek it after the
[1:47:53] due
[1:47:54] order and you know what it had to be you
[1:47:57] couldn't bring the word back in a
[1:47:59] different way the word was meant to be
[1:48:02] carried over the hearts of the Levites
[1:48:04] so God's got an order there's a there's
[1:48:06] a there's a channel for Revival thank
[1:48:09] God because I just when I stand and I
[1:48:11] look at the things the prophet says look
[1:48:13] there I don't I don't believe any person
[1:48:14] in anyone I don't believe anyone
[1:48:16] standing here tonight would want
[1:48:18] anything would chase after everything
[1:48:20] just to be doing something I believe
[1:48:22] there's geness in our lives and even our
[1:48:24] brother Bram could compliment the
[1:48:26] congregation there I could say the same
[1:48:28] thing here I I appreciate the reverence
[1:48:30] I appreciate how God has worked in our
[1:48:32] midst I thankful for all that God has
[1:48:35] done and all that he will do as he sees
[1:48:38] fit and we have need don't you love him
