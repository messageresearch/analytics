[36:02] they receive from the rain
[36:04] and the light
[36:06] [Music]
[36:08] that's
[36:08] that's only an expression

[36:13] our nourishment our strength from the
[36:15] lord
[36:16] oh he's our strength
[36:18] and then all that is he shines upon us

[42:16] that again
[42:17] and certainly
[42:19] you know just how the lord is dealing
[42:21] with her heart
[42:22] so we always encourage that if there's
[42:24] any how god's dealing with your heart
[42:25] don't let anything stand in your way
[42:28] so we just we thank god for that so and
[42:30] right after the the ministering of the
[42:32] word on sunday morning we'll have that
[42:34] baptismal service
[42:36] and then we also have the communion
[42:38] service we will announce that time
[42:41] following the morning service i don't
[42:43] anticipate that being too far apart
[42:45] there
[42:46] because i have to get brother carmen
[42:48] over to
[42:50] the airport to fly out on sunday at a
[42:52] good time anyhow so
[42:55] we just be in prayer for that let's be
[42:57] in prayer for the service that god will

[43:00] just move among us in a special way
[43:04] just know that as i said before you
[43:06] really enjoy brother carmen
[43:08] his ministry
[43:10] i know uh i think paul was the one who
[43:13] was there in youth camp for four days
[43:15] and where the carmen just said brother
[43:17] bill you interpreted for him didn't you
[43:20] yeah i think you did he and brother ivan
[43:22] is in costa rica
[43:24] yes brother ivan carr
[43:26] so that's his father-in-law yeah so he
[43:29] was there
[43:30] that's called some timers
[43:36] yeah i tell you i'm only 46 and i get
[43:38] some timers
[43:40] it's it's not a good thing at all but
[43:43] so he always asks about you but it does
[43:48] so second kings chapter three we want to
[43:50] just read a few verses of scripture and
[43:52] then we'll let you have your seats
[43:55] verse six
[43:56] second kings three
[43:58] and king
[44:00] joram
[44:01] went out of samaria the same time and
[44:05] numbered all israel
[44:06] and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the
[44:09] king of judah saying
[44:11] the king of moab hath rebelled against
[44:13] me
[44:14] will thou go with me against moab to
[44:17] battle
[44:18] and he said
[44:20] i will go up
[44:22] i am as thou art
[44:24] my people as thy people
[44:27] and my horses
[44:28] as thy horses
[44:30] and he said which way shall we go up and
[44:32] he answered the way through the
[44:34] wilderness of edom so the king of israel
[44:37] went and the king of judah
[44:40] and the king of edom and they fetched a
[44:42] compass of seven days journey
[44:44] there was no water for the host and for
[44:46] the cattle that followed them
[44:49] and the king of israel said alas
[44:51] that the lord hath called these three
[44:53] kings together to deliver them into the
[44:56] hand
[44:57] of moab
[44:59] but joshua jehoshaphat said is there not
[45:02] here a prophet of the lord that we may
[45:04] inquire of the lord by him
[45:07] one of the king of israel's servants
[45:10] answered and said here is elisha the son
[45:13] of shafat which poured water on the
[45:15] hands of elijah and jehoshaphat said the
[45:19] word of the lord is with him so the king
[45:21] of israel and jehoshaphat and the king
[45:23] of edom went down to him and elisha said
[45:27] unto the king of israel what have i to
[45:29] do with thee
[45:30] get thee to the prophets of thy father
[45:32] and to the prophets of thy mother
[45:35] the king of israel said unto him nay
[45:38] for the lord hath called these three
[45:39] kings together to deliver them into the
[45:41] hand of moab
[45:43] elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth
[45:46] before whom i stand
[45:48] surely were it not that i regard the
[45:50] presence of jehoshaphat the king of
[45:53] judah i would not look toward thee nor
[45:56] see thee
[45:58] but now bring me a minstrel
[46:00] and it came to pass when the minstrel
[46:02] played that the hand of the lord came
[46:06] upon him i'd just like to speak just for
[46:08] a few moments on inquiring of the lord
[46:12] may god bless the reading of the word as
[46:14] you're being seated
[46:18] they'd say that there's not
[46:20] one of us when we
[46:22] among us
[46:23] that maybe you have things on your heart
[46:26] tonight no doubt things that
[46:29] you're considering
[46:31] things that maybe you're in the midst of
[46:35] and even at times we can reflect back
[46:37] that there's always
[46:39] something that we are seeking the will
[46:41] of the lord about
[46:44] and i always think of how the scripture
[46:46] has told us
[46:48] sometimes when we look at things and how
[46:50] god spoke in isaiah 55 and it's very
[46:54] clear to draw our attention to it that
[46:55] there's a difference in god's thoughts
[46:58] in our thoughts there's a great
[47:00] difference in the way that we think
[47:02] about things and the way god thinks
[47:04] about things
[47:05] and this is why that there is an
[47:08] absolute need for the mind of christ
[47:11] which is the new birth the holy ghost in
[47:14] the life of the believer
[47:16] so that it becomes a
[47:18] an anchor it becomes the influence of
[47:20] our life remember the scripture says
[47:22] regarding our heart that the heart is
[47:25] deceitful above all things
[47:27] and i the lord do search it
[47:30] but after that life has been filled with
[47:33] the spirit of god then that heart
[47:35] becomes under the influence of the holy
[47:39] ghost
[47:40] doesn't mean that our emotions and our
[47:42] feelings and things that we have
[47:44] sometimes
[47:45] can't be drawn in a certain way because
[47:48] remember
[47:49] the lord jesus was a man subject
[47:52] to like passions he was tempted in every
[47:54] way even when they came to him regarding
[47:58] lazarus remember how the test came it
[48:01] came to touch him in his human emotions
[48:04] and say lazarus the one whom thou lovest
[48:08] he's dead
[48:10] see trying to pull him to operate first
[48:14] in that realm
[48:15] now we need every realm god has made it
[48:19] so that the five senses we have that's
[48:21] given to contact our earthly home
[48:24] the five spiritual senses all of those
[48:26] are necessary we see how the spirit of
[48:28] god will use them like for reasoning for
[48:31] example brother branham will always tell
[48:33] us that reasoning as long as it's with
[48:36] the word of god then it's of god
[48:40] but if it's against the word he says
[48:42] then that's your enemy and you'll be
[48:45] against that
[48:46] then he would also see how that god
[48:49] would take the prophet in this hour
[48:51] and tap into that realm of our
[48:53] imagination he would have us in talking
[48:56] about blind bartimaeus we would be in
[48:58] that cool october morning right before
[49:02] the walls of jericho
[49:04] so all of those gates and how all of
[49:07] that would be used and but yet god never
[49:10] intended that man would operate by his
[49:13] natural senses or those five spiritual
[49:16] senses but that man would operate by
[49:20] faith in god alone
[49:23] and so that's god's desire and notice
[49:26] that within that of seeking the will of
[49:28] god it comes down to two two things as
[49:32] we look at it in our lives faith and
[49:35] patience these are two necessary
[49:37] elements and they go hand in hand
[49:39] because you really can't have patience
[49:41] unless you have faith
[49:43] remember as god has brought when god
[49:46] brings a life and into expression if you
[49:49] think about even the statue of a perfect
[49:51] man one of the virtues within there is
[49:54] patience and it's a patience to know
[49:56] that what god has said god will perform
[50:00] i don't know how i don't know when but
[50:02] god will do it that doesn't become less
[50:05] with our walk with god but think how
[50:07] brother branham puts it in is your life
[50:09] worthy of the gospel and i don't know i
[50:11] wasn't there and didn't see him how he
[50:13] put it but let me just play up on words
[50:15] for a minute he says your patience
[50:17] starts up about like this but then he
[50:19] says you find that it grows to this out
[50:21] here
[50:22] and so we find that in our lives and
[50:24] perhaps tonight you can say lord uh
[50:27] i need my patience to grow awful i need
[50:29] it to grow more and we all need growth
[50:32] in our life and we find that none of
[50:34] these things
[50:35] patients it is not something that we're
[50:38] handed growth as though
[50:40] here take this and you grow you know
[50:42] five inches in patience no
[50:45] every one of those virtues in our life
[50:47] they grow through the tests and trials
[50:49] because tests and trials are things that
[50:52] come to help us
[50:55] uh a release ourself of this humanity
[50:58] that we're trapped in
[50:59] even paul himself could acknowledge that
[51:02] god gave him divine assistance because
[51:04] without divine assistance paul could say
[51:07] my pride could get beside itself of
[51:09] concerning the things that god has let
[51:11] me see but god in his infinite wisdom
[51:13] and mercy he will allow things to come
[51:16] up paul's eyesight would come and go
[51:19] because that so paul's pride would not
[51:21] rise into a place to where god couldn't
[51:24] use him i think that's something that we
[51:26] can say lord i need divine assistance i
[51:30] need your strength lord even sometimes
[51:32] when things come our way and we feel
[51:34] like we're blindsided and why did this
[51:36] come about this way and sometimes we're
[51:38] looking because we're prone maybe in our
[51:41] makeup some of us more than others we're
[51:43] prone to try to put things in place to
[51:46] avoid problems because nobody likes
[51:48] dealing with problems and we're prone to
[51:51] try to do that depending on our makeup
[51:53] but you see we cannot we're not meant to
[51:56] live to where that our lives are going
[51:58] to be problem free as a matter of fact
[52:00] in our lives we understand that as
[52:01] believers we're either in a test trial
[52:04] we're coming to one or we're coming out
[52:06] of one it's a continual process but
[52:09] that's all part of character molding and
[52:12] what melds the character is not the
[52:14] tester trial it's the life on the inside
[52:18] that molds the character as we surrender
[52:21] to him and say lord not my mind but your
[52:24] mind in this lord i don't understand i
[52:27] don't know what's going on but like
[52:28] brother brahms said just give me the
[52:30] grace to go through it lord give me
[52:32] strength to go through it let me conduct
[52:34] myself with joy drawing from that
[52:37] strength of that life on the inside with
[52:40] you so faith and patience are absolutely
[52:43] the necessary parts when we're seeking
[52:46] the will of god because it requires
[52:49] complete reliance upon the lord
[52:52] faith is is that whatever he says that's
[52:55] what i'm going to do
[52:57] i i'm not going to i'm not going to
[52:59] count it to my reasoning i'm just
[53:00] looking to you lord just help me to be
[53:03] sensitive and patience because god
[53:06] doesn't always speak when we're down on
[53:08] our knees or laying prostrate or the
[53:10] moment we're in prayer or we come out of
[53:12] prayer or the next day or the next hour
[53:15] sometimes what we're praying about we
[53:17] don't get an immediate answer
[53:20] we have to wait and god answers in his
[53:23] own time
[53:24] and in his own way
[53:28] jehoshaphat when we look at this
[53:30] inquiring of the lord
[53:32] jehoshaphat let me just refer to it in
[53:35] looking in this manner
[53:37] you you can look at with with him and
[53:39] this is very similar to an occurrence
[53:42] that jehoshaphat had with ahab which is
[53:47] joram's dad
[53:49] ahab
[53:50] jehoshaphat did the same thing there
[53:52] they have presented a situation hey
[53:54] ramos gilead belongs to us we're
[53:56] brothers you know we're oh we're all
[53:58] israelites and and jehoshaphat does the
[54:01] same thing there
[54:03] that he does right here
[54:05] let's go on up and let's go on up and
[54:06] take it
[54:08] and yet when you look at jehoshaphat i
[54:09] want us to look at this very closely
[54:11] because with jehoshaphat brother adam
[54:14] when you look at how brother branham
[54:15] will describe jehoshaphat these are the
[54:17] things that brother brown will say about
[54:19] him he's a righteous man who loved the
[54:21] lord
[54:22] a wonderful man
[54:24] a god-fearing man a believer a man of
[54:27] god a spiritual man a mighty man god was
[54:31] with him
[54:32] these are all of the descriptions or
[54:35] accolades that that that the spirit of
[54:38] god even through the prophet would would
[54:41] express and what he's seeing is here
[54:43] within jehoshaphat's life it wasn't that
[54:46] jehoshaphat was a perfect man
[54:48] but he was the jehoshaphat if you
[54:50] consider elisha in the midst of the
[54:53] company of people who are there elisha
[54:56] said i wouldn't even stand here and look
[54:59] at the rest of you if it wasn't
[55:01] jehoshaphat was here
[55:03] jehoshaphat there was a respect but you
[55:05] know what the respect was it was the
[55:07] same mutual respect that jehoshaphat had
[55:11] for elisha that's when they asked hey
[55:14] when the situation arose it was no one
[55:16] else there that said hey is there not
[55:19] one here that we can consult the lord
[55:21] and ask him what to do but you see when
[55:24] they said elisha's here jehoshaphat said
[55:27] i know him i know that the word of the
[55:29] lord is with him because i know he has
[55:32] the same acquaintance the same god of
[55:34] elijah is there with elisha so i know
[55:37] the word of the lord is with him and so
[55:40] there was an acquaintance that was there
[55:42] there was a respect that was there about
[55:44] jehoshaphat's life and so when i when we
[55:47] look at all of this you know sometimes
[55:50] when we we see this of those things i
[55:52] read to you that brother branham would
[55:53] say concerning jehoshaphat who'd say my
[55:57] what a great man but i want you to catch
[55:59] this because when all of those accolades
[56:02] and those things that are true about our
[56:04] life a god-fearing person a believer one
[56:08] whom god is with a righteous man who
[56:10] loved the lord these are all displayed
[56:13] through his life but through all of that
[56:16] display there's still a target on him as
[56:20] there is on every believer
[56:22] that satan himself is out just he's got
[56:25] traps he has everything else set out
[56:28] around our life so there's no need to
[56:30] step back and say well you know the
[56:32] prophet said i'm a righteous man i love
[56:34] the lord a mighty man and all these
[56:36] other accolades but it's even it's a
[56:38] sign to be even more so in prayer
[56:44] if there ever was a people that should
[56:45] be more in prayer brother brahman said
[56:47] it like this let your prayer life be
[56:50] be be second to nothing
[56:54] this is a living so close to almighty
[56:57] god
[56:58] because as brother branham put it in
[57:00] this way he's asked the question is it
[57:02] possible for a believer to be driven to
[57:05] do minor things or influence to do minor
[57:08] things and brother brahms says
[57:10] absolutely he said because before god
[57:12] got a hold of your life he said you were
[57:15] just slouching around going anywhere
[57:17] doing what you pleased but now you're in
[57:19] the army of the lord
[57:21] god's dealt with your life there's come
[57:23] a surrender in your life there's coming
[57:25] experience in your life there is a
[57:28] target there that the enemy is trying to
[57:31] come against now don't focus on the
[57:32] target because the real answer to all of
[57:35] that is not looking around saying well
[57:37] where's the target where it's like
[57:38] you're studying for landmines if you
[57:41] just focus on the lord every landmine
[57:44] will be uncovered
[57:46] the targets are what the enemy has even
[57:49] things that he's come to shoot at you it
[57:52] doesn't mean the target will be removed
[57:54] but like he told the prophet there's a
[57:56] test coming for you and brother branham
[57:58] didn't know what that test was then god
[58:00] didn't tell him this is how it's going
[58:01] to be in this and that but you see let
[58:03] him know there's going to be a test come
[58:05] and right there in that service here
[58:08] come a test around in that moment and
[58:10] right there the prophet stood there here
[58:13] he was in contact with god and notice
[58:16] when that young couple was making out on
[58:18] the front row notice it was given in his
[58:21] hand speak death it'll be death or speak
[58:24] life showing the presence of almighty
[58:26] god and he says i forgive you for that
[58:29] but don't stay in this meeting and
[58:30] continue to do that you go ahead and
[58:32] leave if you're going to do those things
[58:35] it gave him life it gave forgiveness it
[58:37] was a test that come we don't know the
[58:40] tests or traps as brother branham says
[58:42] we don't know that but we're not to be
[58:44] occupied as though we're walking around
[58:47] oh not in fear but we ought to be
[58:50] careful with every step but being
[58:53] careful that we're directed by god
[58:58] the closer we get to the end of the way
[59:01] that becomes more precious to us
[59:03] to be directed
[59:05] by the things of god
[59:07] and so
[59:09] it comes to that place that we we need
[59:13] in everything to really seek the
[59:14] leadership of the lord in all things
[59:17] no matter how they appear
[59:20] or feel
[59:22] no matter how they appear
[59:24] or they feel i can't really deal with a
[59:26] lot of that tonight but just to think
[59:28] about no matter how they appear or they
[59:31] feel think of how god spoke here in amos
[59:34] chapter 3. it's concerning the children
[59:37] of israel
[59:38] hear this word that the lord has spoken
[59:40] against you old children of israel
[59:42] against the whole family which i brought
[59:44] up from the land of egypt saying you
[59:47] only have i known of all the families of
[59:49] the earth therefore i will punish you
[59:52] for all your iniquities
[59:54] can two walk together except they be
[59:57] agreed now remember god sent prophets
[1:00:01] early in other words that was god's
[1:00:03] first priority was to call israel back
[1:00:06] to
[1:00:07] the the word by the word of the lord
[1:00:09] back to the word they had the word but
[1:00:12] they didn't have the word of the lord
[1:00:14] you see a people can have the bible and
[1:00:17] not have the word of the lord because
[1:00:19] when you have the word of the lord it
[1:00:21] produces the life of the lord
[1:00:24] are you hearing me it's not reasoning
[1:00:26] you now have the very author and the
[1:00:29] person because it's not to know his word
[1:00:31] is life
[1:00:33] it's to know him
[1:00:35] is that right it's to know him his life
[1:00:38] and so think of this god brought them
[1:00:40] out of egypt think of this he
[1:00:43] he brought them on eagle's wings
[1:00:45] everything of god such grace that he
[1:00:47] provided for them but when israel began
[1:00:50] to go astray and they push back on the
[1:00:53] word then god let him know you and i are
[1:00:56] not agreed
[1:00:58] we can't walk together
[1:01:00] we're not we don't have the same focus
[1:01:02] we don't have the same desire and so god
[1:01:05] himself pulled back from his people
[1:01:09] and this is a principle are you hearing
[1:01:11] me now see we're looking at we're seeing
[1:01:14] the very nature that's the thing that
[1:01:17] even is missing when you look at within
[1:01:19] the christian world and that's the very
[1:01:22] thing that sometimes that people are
[1:01:24] overlooking even right around the
[1:01:25] message it's the character the message
[1:01:28] itself reveals the character and the
[1:01:32] nature of jesus christ that's why we can
[1:01:35] have an examination and say i'm in or
[1:01:38] i'm not in and i need to get in because
[1:01:40] it's his nature the life in the blood
[1:01:44] being revealed that exposes where we're
[1:01:46] at and at the same time can say if
[1:01:49] you're not here come in
[1:01:53] it's his nature that's why brother brown
[1:01:55] could say in the message all things 62
[1:01:58] leading up to the opening of the seals
[1:02:00] he says when the seals are open it will
[1:02:03] reveal his nature well how can it reveal
[1:02:06] its nature because the seals themselves
[1:02:09] is christ coming to the church and being
[1:02:12] revealed that's why brother brown could
[1:02:14] say he is those seals he took the seals
[1:02:19] off of himself
[1:02:20] he is that seventh seal first second
[1:02:23] third fourth fifth sixth it's the
[1:02:26] seventh seal christ himself who was
[1:02:28] there present revealing and taking the
[1:02:32] cover off the enemy who is it right here
[1:02:34] right here tonight that takes the cover
[1:02:36] off the enemy who is it in our life it's
[1:02:39] christ himself in bright form that
[1:02:43] exposes the enemy
[1:02:46] hallelujah oh glory be to god
[1:02:50] can two walk together except they be
[1:02:53] agreed notice
[1:02:55] ii corinthians 6 paul picks this up
[1:02:58] be you not unequally yoked together with
[1:03:02] unbelievers
[1:03:04] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:03:06] with unrighteousness
[1:03:08] and what communion hath light but
[1:03:10] darkness
[1:03:11] what concord what agreement hath christ
[1:03:14] with biliary or what part have he that
[1:03:17] believeth with an infidel
[1:03:20] now you you and i all of us
[1:03:22] have to work around individuals
[1:03:26] come on even in our families
[1:03:29] is that right
[1:03:30] and we realize that in our families that
[1:03:33] you're not to draw yourself off
[1:03:35] but neither should you be or we be under
[1:03:38] the influence of those who are not
[1:03:41] converted
[1:03:43] are you hearing me now i'm going to win
[1:03:45] them to the lord who's winning who
[1:03:47] i said who's winning who
[1:03:49] because with the the moment that you
[1:03:51] start lacking back on things of god it
[1:03:54] shows there's influence coming and
[1:03:57] pulling you away from the right source
[1:04:00] how can you win somebody to christ when
[1:04:02] you're being pulled away from him
[1:04:05] oh i'm just you know i'm going to love
[1:04:07] them in i'm going to go visit them on
[1:04:08] sunday and amen what you are showing
[1:04:10] them when you do that is i think more of
[1:04:12] you than i do jesus
[1:04:16] plain and simple brother bram said how
[1:04:18] do we win our loved ones by being loyal
[1:04:22] to what you believe
[1:04:24] so if you believe
[1:04:26] that that's okay then you have a problem
[1:04:28] with your belief because that belief is
[1:04:31] not scripture the bible said forsake not
[1:04:35] to assemble yourselves together boy i
[1:04:37] don't know how we're getting here
[1:04:39] for satan not to assemble ourselves as
[1:04:42] the manner of some
[1:04:44] is
[1:04:45] brother brandon said when those church
[1:04:47] doors are open if you've got the love of
[1:04:49] god in your heart you can't wait for
[1:04:53] them to open
[1:04:56] plain and simple
[1:04:58] so here when we're looking at it
[1:05:00] associates matters
[1:05:03] i think of young people think of others
[1:05:06] all of us associates matter who we
[1:05:08] associate with you know god can speak
[1:05:11] right to your life and you get around
[1:05:13] the wrong people your healing can leave
[1:05:18] deliverance can leave because why it's
[1:05:20] spirits this is spiritual warfare
[1:05:24] brother branham put it very simply like
[1:05:26] this with jehoshaphat brother brahma
[1:05:28] said it in this manner he says when you
[1:05:30] go to join yourself up with an
[1:05:32] unbeliever he says you start taking on
[1:05:35] his ways
[1:05:38] if you don't watch
[1:05:42] that can happen very easily
[1:05:44] because there's people at work
[1:05:46] that know how
[1:05:48] to cut down the people who are doing the
[1:05:50] job because
[1:05:52] they can do it better you know they
[1:05:53] could tell them how to do it they just
[1:05:54] come and ask them they could tell me
[1:05:56] they didn't go to schooling for it but
[1:05:57] they could tell them
[1:06:00] and so they spend their time
[1:06:02] oh you know just
[1:06:09] right
[1:06:10] and if you're not careful you can get
[1:06:12] caught in that now every one of us don't
[1:06:14] raise your hands
[1:06:15] every one of us we've got why there's
[1:06:17] still a part about us we're still in our
[1:06:20] humanity but they speak to god there's
[1:06:23] something that rises up there on the
[1:06:24] inside that says uh-uh
[1:06:26] you shouldn't have been going along with
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:29] it might be true what's being said but
[1:06:32] don't get in on it
[1:06:35] is that right
[1:06:37] there was nothing they could say
[1:06:39] regarding daniel
[1:06:40] in the kingdom
[1:06:43] is that right nothing
[1:06:45] now i want you to look at that this that
[1:06:47] just shows us when we see those things
[1:06:49] that's not to put us down that's to show
[1:06:52] the living god who's right here among us
[1:06:54] there is a quickening power here that
[1:06:56] daniel own daniel knew as it would come
[1:07:00] to him but he didn't know it by the
[1:07:02] indwelling power of the holy ghost you
[1:07:04] or i that's been privileged to enter
[1:07:06] behind the veil that quickening power is
[1:07:08] resting in your life
[1:07:11] the same one that came to daniel gave
[1:07:14] him strength that brother bram says he
[1:07:16] began to feel coming up his arm when
[1:07:18] them lines were coming near that same
[1:07:19] quickening power rest within a child of
[1:07:22] god but he says if you don't watch you
[1:07:25] start taking up
[1:07:27] their ways
[1:07:28] and you go off what was one of the ways
[1:07:31] they didn't even consult the lord
[1:07:35] jehoshaphat could have asked did you
[1:07:37] pray about it
[1:07:40] and frankly within it
[1:07:43] jehoshaphat
[1:07:45] could have just looked at it and not
[1:07:46] even having to ask did you pray about it
[1:07:49] jehoshaphat if he would have looked
[1:07:52] beyond
[1:07:54] what appeared and his feelings
[1:07:57] because sometimes we can get stuck in
[1:07:59] that gate of
[1:08:00] compassion
[1:08:03] oh
[1:08:04] we just want to express love we just
[1:08:07] there was a curse on the house of ahab
[1:08:11] are you hearing me they were rebellious
[1:08:14] against the word of the lord
[1:08:16] i don't know about you but do you want
[1:08:18] to associate with somebody or one that's
[1:08:20] cursed
[1:08:22] come on friends i mean this is why even
[1:08:25] in the early even in the early church i
[1:08:28] think it's cyrenthius or whatever they
[1:08:29] went in the bath house and john and
[1:08:31] these guys that were you know that were
[1:08:32] coming right against the message in that
[1:08:34] time in the early days you know right
[1:08:37] after pentecost and one or more the one
[1:08:39] of them ran out of the bath house said i
[1:08:40] don't even want to be in there this
[1:08:41] guy's in there because it's sure to fall
[1:08:43] in
[1:08:44] just heard brother brandon say it the
[1:08:45] other day on the tape he said regarding
[1:08:47] people who stood up against the word he
[1:08:49] said i don't wouldn't even want to be in
[1:08:51] the same building just you know the
[1:08:52] building might come in on them
[1:08:55] listen what are you saying that i'm
[1:08:57] saying that sometimes these feelings and
[1:08:59] things that can be had but it needs to
[1:09:02] come back to that the word is the
[1:09:04] ultimate it is the headship the final
[1:09:07] authority the amen in our life
[1:09:12] because jehoshaphat didn't even have to
[1:09:14] pray about is it is it god's will for me
[1:09:17] to go and get myself yoked together with
[1:09:20] with your ram on this
[1:09:23] are you hearing me
[1:09:27] but see
[1:09:28] what if eve think about this jehoshaphat
[1:09:31] could have said yeah yeah okay okay it's
[1:09:33] all right but if jehoshaphat would have
[1:09:35] went back and even prayed about it after
[1:09:38] that moment said you know what
[1:09:40] i need i need to pray about this i you
[1:09:42] know i went ahead and committed myself
[1:09:43] to doing this and doing that we've all
[1:09:45] been there we committed we promised that
[1:09:47] oh yeah i'll do that i'll do that i'll
[1:09:49] but
[1:09:51] if the lord wills
[1:09:53] sometimes we've committed ourselves
[1:09:55] without consulting the lord
[1:09:58] is that right all of us all of us have
[1:10:00] been there but what if jehoshaphat would
[1:10:02] have did something that
[1:10:04] eve should have done
[1:10:06] you know you weren't going to stop the
[1:10:07] enemy from coming through the vessel of
[1:10:10] the serpent and trying to reason and my
[1:10:13] everything's appearing just right
[1:10:15] sounding just right but all eve would
[1:10:18] have had to do is say you know what this
[1:10:20] all sounds really good i mean i'm moved
[1:10:22] emotionally man it just it it even seems
[1:10:25] right but you know what
[1:10:27] i want to talk to papa
[1:10:32] see she didn't sin now brother brahma
[1:10:34] says when she stopped to listen to
[1:10:37] entertain it
[1:10:39] you can hear it but when she if she
[1:10:41] would have just taken what she heard and
[1:10:43] not begin to open herself to it and just
[1:10:46] took it back and said papa this is
[1:10:49] what's been said i'll tell you first
[1:10:51] thing when cheetah got away from that
[1:10:53] anointing of unbelief that atmosphere
[1:10:57] that comes through that associates
[1:10:59] already it would have been different she
[1:11:02] would have been started beginning to
[1:11:03] approach papa what do you say about this
[1:11:06] i'll tell you as soon as the way from
[1:11:08] that atmosphere those things would have
[1:11:10] started to wake up a little bit
[1:11:13] is that right
[1:11:14] that happens to us we can get away and
[1:11:16] you have my why did i commit to that
[1:11:19] what in the world did i what in the
[1:11:20] world did i do
[1:11:24] so it sounds reasonable
[1:11:27] sounds reasonable or has people and the
[1:11:29] person could say that's just common
[1:11:31] sense
[1:11:36] like we looked at on sunday
[1:11:39] god don't make sense
[1:11:40] to the natural mind
[1:11:42] he does things and ask us to do things
[1:11:45] because even the new birth does not make
[1:11:48] sense to the natural mind
[1:11:51] is that right
[1:11:52] it's a mystery
[1:11:54] but it's not something vague out there
[1:11:56] you know when it's happened because your
[1:11:58] life has been changed
[1:12:01] and there's an amen on the inside of
[1:12:03] your life
[1:12:04] it's not what you're trying to do but
[1:12:07] there's a love affair there's a fountain
[1:12:09] there's a life that's behind you that's
[1:12:12] pulsating that's desiring for the will
[1:12:15] of god
[1:12:16] so it sounds reasonable many things
[1:12:18] sound reasonable
[1:12:20] this is why we must have discernment
[1:12:23] i want you to listen to a few things
[1:12:24] that brother abraham said regarding this
[1:12:26] with jehoshaphat
[1:12:28] when he speaks about jehoshaphat coming
[1:12:30] together
[1:12:33] with jorah
[1:12:34] i don't have these up there because i'm
[1:12:35] just going to refer to a couple places
[1:12:37] he said they had dinner the two of them
[1:12:39] together and that's what they'd done
[1:12:42] then under the spell
[1:12:45] of showing what great things they had as
[1:12:47] a nation
[1:12:48] he fell a victim to hooking himself up
[1:12:51] with an unbeliever do you know paul when
[1:12:54] i dress in the book of galatians when
[1:12:57] paul could get among him and he saw that
[1:12:59] here the people were not resting but
[1:13:01] they you know oh am i keeping this and
[1:13:03] am i doing this and paul immediately
[1:13:05] could tell there's unrest here in their
[1:13:08] spirit
[1:13:09] and that's why paul could say who
[1:13:12] hath bewitched you
[1:13:16] that you should not trust and believe in
[1:13:19] the full counsel of god that's why he
[1:13:21] could say who who did the working of
[1:13:23] miracles among you by the law or by or
[1:13:26] by the spirit of faith
[1:13:29] you see spirits they come we're not we
[1:13:33] are in a warfare
[1:13:35] and it's not you can't fight the
[1:13:37] supernatural with natural
[1:13:40] you can't fight the enemy with reason
[1:13:42] he's a pro
[1:13:44] he'll smoke us all the way from wherever
[1:13:47] ever he's he's greater than us in
[1:13:49] reasoning
[1:13:52] he's greater any of those other senses
[1:13:55] but there's one thing that is not
[1:13:56] greater than and that's
[1:13:58] faith
[1:14:00] faith defeats him every time
[1:14:04] faith isn't about that we understand
[1:14:06] everything but faith says i just trust
[1:14:10] the lord
[1:14:12] you ain't moving me off of my ground
[1:14:16] this is my promise that god has given me
[1:14:20] but jehoshaphat a believer a righteous
[1:14:23] man who loved the lord god fearing man
[1:14:25] mighty man god was with him on and on
[1:14:27] and on and on but yet when he came to
[1:14:30] dinner
[1:14:33] the joram he came under a spell
[1:14:40] that's why
[1:14:41] when you leave out of work you leave
[1:14:43] around different places
[1:14:45] that's why you have to pray and say god
[1:14:48] wash me
[1:14:50] watch me it's spirits
[1:14:52] it's spirits
[1:14:54] and you have to look and say god wash me
[1:14:56] because if not those spirits will want
[1:14:58] to they want to follow you
[1:15:00] they want to follow you torment you
[1:15:03] all and then come right among the family
[1:15:05] but we have to be mindful as priest of
[1:15:07] god before a priest could come in god
[1:15:10] told moses you put a laver at right
[1:15:12] there when they come in the door and
[1:15:14] that labor is to have a spigot because
[1:15:16] it's got to be running water and when
[1:15:17] they come in they've got to wash their
[1:15:19] hands
[1:15:20] and they have to wash their feet
[1:15:22] why
[1:15:23] you have to be cleansed to worship
[1:15:26] our hands
[1:15:27] are the doings the feet is the goings
[1:15:30] that's why jesus could say that once a
[1:15:33] man has been washed talking about his
[1:15:35] soul he need not save wash but his feet
[1:15:39] only
[1:15:41] right
[1:15:41] we rub shoulders with the world
[1:15:45] we see things hear things we don't ask
[1:15:47] to see don't ask to hear
[1:15:50] but
[1:15:51] we have a lutron or a labor we have a
[1:15:54] washing of water by the word
[1:15:57] we have an access that we can go to god
[1:16:00] and there can be a cleansing
[1:16:03] it's spirits
[1:16:06] jehoshaphat all of these remember don't
[1:16:08] let that drift from you all the
[1:16:09] accolades of really what he is
[1:16:12] but he comes under a spell
[1:16:14] by starting to associate that's why the
[1:16:16] greatest thing that you or i can do if
[1:16:18] there's something that's coming up and
[1:16:19] you might be something you set down but
[1:16:22] you realize wait a minute here this
[1:16:24] ain't going to go no further
[1:16:26] we're not going no further with this
[1:16:28] because it can come right under
[1:16:31] a spell
[1:16:32] i don't get no who
[1:16:34] understand a spirit
[1:16:36] right
[1:16:37] you get around somebody that's critical
[1:16:39] look brother ram says very clearly this
[1:16:41] old it's a hillbilly saying but it's
[1:16:42] true you can't lay down with a dog
[1:16:44] that's got fleas and get up and not
[1:16:46] expect to have
[1:16:47] he's scratching you'll be
[1:16:50] why you've been laying with him
[1:16:53] right
[1:16:54] just simple things that we can
[1:16:56] understand
[1:16:57] notice brother bram in another place
[1:16:59] notice how easy i want you to catch this
[1:17:01] it is sometimes
[1:17:03] on a little persuasion
[1:17:05] for a christian to get in the wrong
[1:17:07] company
[1:17:09] trying to be
[1:17:10] pity
[1:17:12] oh
[1:17:12] how do you all say in spanish with poor
[1:17:14] business
[1:17:27] oh they're so pitiful
[1:17:29] in the south they say oh bless your
[1:17:31] heart that means you're pitiful
[1:17:38] just feel sorry for him listen to me
[1:17:41] that's a trap of the enemy
[1:17:44] we're not to be hardened that we don't
[1:17:47] feel
[1:17:48] sympathy
[1:17:49] but we're to balance it with the word
[1:17:52] if our pity is leading us outside the
[1:17:55] word that's where it stops and wait wait
[1:17:57] wait wait wait wait it's got to come
[1:17:59] back into the word that's why it matters
[1:18:02] who our associates are let me tell you
[1:18:04] very clearly as soon as god and every
[1:18:07] one of us in here when god starts
[1:18:08] dealing with your life and the people
[1:18:10] that i had contacting me oh my when god
[1:18:14] began to deal with my life and my life i
[1:18:17] made a surrender to the lord oh my the
[1:18:20] people wanting the pressure and all this
[1:18:22] and that and one more i'm gonna tell you
[1:18:25] i didn't want to be around them
[1:18:29] i had no desire to be around them i knew
[1:18:31] what they talked like i knew what they
[1:18:33] were i knew those kind of atmospheres
[1:18:35] and i also know the trick about when
[1:18:37] they could say well you can come on out
[1:18:39] here and be with us you know you don't
[1:18:40] have to do this and that you know you
[1:18:42] can just drink coke or pepsi or whatever
[1:18:44] more but something rolls up within me
[1:18:46] and says but how can two walk together
[1:18:49] unless they be agreed
[1:18:51] it matters who you are linked to on
[1:18:53] facebook it matters who you're linked to
[1:18:55] on instagram it matters who you
[1:18:57] fellowship with
[1:19:00] it matters
[1:19:03] our life we should see if you are
[1:19:05] seeking to be a better artist you might
[1:19:07] say i'm not interested in art but let's
[1:19:09] just say you were
[1:19:11] you wouldn't associate with me who has
[1:19:13] problems drawing a stick figure
[1:19:16] you'd want somebody who's good at art
[1:19:17] like brianna you'd want to associate
[1:19:19] with fam that they they're good in art
[1:19:22] or somebody who's more trained in it you
[1:19:24] find out who they are don't you realize
[1:19:26] because there's things you'll pick up
[1:19:28] and you'll learn from there it matters
[1:19:30] who you associate with
[1:19:38] who man
[1:19:41] another statement brother brennan may
[1:19:42] jehoshaphat made that wrong move
[1:19:46] which is most likely to come to every
[1:19:48] one of us
[1:19:49] we make the wrong move it's so
[1:19:52] easy
[1:19:54] that sounds like an experience talking
[1:19:56] there
[1:19:58] it's so easy to make the wrong move
[1:20:05] pity
[1:20:06] under the spell of
[1:20:08] let me just say it in this way
[1:20:11] satan
[1:20:13] uses reasoning
[1:20:15] and will use sources
[1:20:17] that can pull
[1:20:19] upon your heart strings
[1:20:22] you'll do things that are pulled
[1:20:24] upon your heartstring because he knows
[1:20:26] if i can get them out there into an
[1:20:28] emotional realm
[1:20:30] you'll do things that pool
[1:20:32] upon your heart springs
[1:20:35] you use those things
[1:20:37] but if it reasons against the word of
[1:20:39] god
[1:20:41] it is the enemy
[1:20:43] behind
[1:20:44] that source
[1:20:46] are you hearing me
[1:20:47] it's not the source is the enemy
[1:20:51] the serpent wasn't the enemy it was the
[1:20:53] serpent behind it
[1:20:56] job discerned and said thou speakest
[1:20:58] like
[1:21:00] a foolish woman
[1:21:02] he was discerning
[1:21:04] what was
[1:21:06] coming behind the source
[1:21:08] that's why we can't go by how things
[1:21:10] appear
[1:21:12] or how they feel
[1:21:14] or this just feels right
[1:21:17] it just looks right
[1:21:22] for the same you you that's confusing me
[1:21:24] it shouldn't
[1:21:26] it shouldn't that's satan's objective
[1:21:30] satan dwells in beauty now listen to me
[1:21:33] not god-given beauty
[1:21:36] not god-given beauty satan dwells in a
[1:21:39] beauty that works to try to do things
[1:21:43] and enhance things and cause things to
[1:21:45] arouse out of people that should not be
[1:21:50] are you with me that's why brother brahm
[1:21:52] could say
[1:21:53] for our sisters he says it's a god
[1:21:56] given
[1:21:57] a privilege it's a god-given it's a
[1:21:59] characteristic to want to be beautiful
[1:22:03] but satan wants to take that and try to
[1:22:06] anoint it cut the hair just you know
[1:22:09] you're a little pale put a little makeup
[1:22:11] on or if you just put a little blush on
[1:22:13] you just do a little bit of this and
[1:22:15] what's he trying to do you know what
[1:22:16] he's doing he's speaking against who god
[1:22:19] has made
[1:22:20] right there you ought to draw the line
[1:22:22] and say wait a minute i am fearfully and
[1:22:25] wonderfully made
[1:22:27] right there you should draw the line say
[1:22:29] wait a minute i'm going to consult my
[1:22:30] maker because you're not the creator
[1:22:32] you're the perverter
[1:22:34] see how the word in fellowship with the
[1:22:37] word you start discerning those things
[1:22:39] as they want to come in that way
[1:22:43] satan uses those things to try to pull
[1:22:45] up on our heartstrings he'll use family
[1:22:47] to try to pull up on our heartstrings
[1:22:51] oh mom and dad why don't you just come
[1:22:53] down for a a cookout we're going to have
[1:22:55] a wonderful time on sunday oh
[1:22:57] it's going to be lovely all the family's
[1:22:59] going to be here we're just going to sit
[1:23:01] around the campfire and we're just going
[1:23:03] to
[1:23:05] what you're doing trying to pull on your
[1:23:06] heartstrings
[1:23:07] but see when you can stand on the word
[1:23:09] and say
[1:23:10] for saying not to assemble yourselves
[1:23:12] together
[1:23:15] this isn't by chance well that's the
[1:23:16] only day they have off but you see if it
[1:23:19] was really valuable to them they'd take
[1:23:22] friday off or saturday off and say you
[1:23:24] know what we respect you and the gods
[1:23:27] you serve we'll have it on saturday
[1:23:29] instead
[1:23:32] well the fire's just flowing we're just
[1:23:33] right in it
[1:23:36] didn't know all this was in here but
[1:23:37] we'll just preach it
[1:23:42] now let's let me let's just read a
[1:23:43] little something here
[1:23:45] at the prophet and i actually gave this
[1:23:46] quote i think it's in the prophet elisha
[1:23:49] brother braham says they went off in
[1:23:50] such a hurry
[1:23:52] without even considering god
[1:23:55] and when they found out the seven days
[1:23:56] was up well
[1:23:58] their water supply was
[1:24:00] cut off they didn't have any water to
[1:24:02] drink
[1:24:03] there they was out there with their
[1:24:04] cattle with their animals with their
[1:24:06] water supply was cut off and it looks
[1:24:08] like that it was just about the end for
[1:24:10] them
[1:24:12] now that's what
[1:24:14] we do
[1:24:16] sometimes we go off on a tantrum that
[1:24:18] means
[1:24:19] frustration we just act hastily
[1:24:22] somewhere and not think about god
[1:24:25] not pray over it
[1:24:27] ask the lord whether we should do it or
[1:24:29] not why well it just makes sense
[1:24:34] it just this sounds reasonable
[1:24:36] and we find out that our supply
[1:24:40] of blessings is cut off then we wonder
[1:24:43] sometime well i wonder why i can't have
[1:24:45] no more blessings
[1:24:47] you don't watch now remember remember
[1:24:49] all those spiritual accolades that
[1:24:52] jehoshaphat a righteous man who loved
[1:24:53] the lord and all those things but
[1:24:55] there's a target
[1:24:56] the enemy's after
[1:24:59] he says you don't watch
[1:25:02] and you let down
[1:25:04] in your prayer life
[1:25:06] you say well i'm a christian
[1:25:08] let's just bring that up a little bit
[1:25:11] because a real message believer you're a
[1:25:13] you're a christian because christian
[1:25:14] means to be christ-like
[1:25:16] but somehow we you can get our thoughts
[1:25:18] like i'm in a message
[1:25:21] praise god i mean there's nothing can
[1:25:24] get me man
[1:25:26] i'm the epitome
[1:25:28] of discernment
[1:25:29] i'm like a walking mri i can see it all
[1:25:39] right there shows uh oh
[1:25:42] you're not living where you need to be
[1:25:44] because when you're living when you need
[1:25:45] to be you realize you're looking up to
[1:25:46] him
[1:25:49] right
[1:25:50] so remember it's not when we see this
[1:25:54] it's not well i'm a christian
[1:25:56] that just means there's a target
[1:25:59] well that's the more sign you should
[1:26:02] pray
[1:26:03] more than ever
[1:26:07] more than ever that's more of a sign
[1:26:11] now notice notice this next statement
[1:26:12] here my goodness you could preach a
[1:26:14] month or sundays out of this quote
[1:26:16] read the bible
[1:26:17] every day
[1:26:19] pray every day you know there's
[1:26:21] absolutely no excuse we've got it on our
[1:26:23] phones
[1:26:25] tablets
[1:26:26] everywhere everywhere
[1:26:28] reading plan and whatever more well you
[1:26:30] know brother simon i just don't feel
[1:26:32] inspired
[1:26:33] there's many times i don't feel inspired
[1:26:35] when i sit down with devotions
[1:26:39] brother samuel you mean you don't have
[1:26:41] donuts with angels no
[1:26:44] not even if the krispy kreme they don't
[1:26:46] come
[1:26:50] but it shows sometimes this is where
[1:26:52] we've got to set this thing down and say
[1:26:55] you know what this is what you need
[1:26:57] you may not you might feel like donuts
[1:27:00] but you need greens today boy
[1:27:03] are you hearing me
[1:27:04] sometimes we we we look at this friends
[1:27:07] i'm talking about we every one of us in
[1:27:08] here we look at it bill that oh he just
[1:27:11] ought to flow this is a warfare
[1:27:14] these outer senses the five spiritual
[1:27:16] senses isn't it amazing they don't have
[1:27:18] to tell us
[1:27:20] how your sweat oh i got to pick up my
[1:27:21] phone you mean i've got to watch a
[1:27:23] documentary on youtube oh i just don't i
[1:27:26] just don't feel like i've got the
[1:27:28] inspiration for it hello
[1:27:33] but you see reading getting into the
[1:27:35] word why reading the bible praying that
[1:27:39] that feeds a life i never forget brother
[1:27:41] uh when i was out there in flagstaff i
[1:27:43] was in brother jim dalton's office there
[1:27:46] and i was looking at this uh
[1:27:48] rock that he had right there
[1:27:50] and the many different memories you know
[1:27:52] from with brother branham and brother
[1:27:54] jim told me this this was wrote and it
[1:27:56] had in quotations the edge he said
[1:27:58] myself and other ministers asked brother
[1:28:00] brown because we wanted to have the edge
[1:28:02] on things you know the ed the cutting
[1:28:04] edge we wanted to have the edge and he
[1:28:06] asked for the brain he says you know we
[1:28:07] want and that's why we as believers we
[1:28:09] want to be have the edge we want to be
[1:28:10] ready and he said brother brown what
[1:28:13] what is it that we can be on the edge
[1:28:14] brother braham says
[1:28:16] read
[1:28:17] read
[1:28:18] read your bible every day and pray
[1:28:22] and so brother jim just says that very
[1:28:24] simple right there read your bible and
[1:28:26] pray that's the edge on the devil
[1:28:29] because as we're reading the word oh
[1:28:32] whether you feel spiritual or not within
[1:28:34] it praying whether you feel that whole
[1:28:37] night that moment is your prank remember
[1:28:39] what's happening you are becoming
[1:28:42] acquainted
[1:28:43] with him
[1:28:45] with his character with his nature
[1:28:48] because it never changes
[1:28:50] and there's things that as we're reading
[1:28:52] in the word of god you're listening to
[1:28:53] the word of god you'll catch things and
[1:28:55] say wow
[1:28:57] that's something what it is you're
[1:28:59] catching the ways that he moves the way
[1:29:02] he works his nature his character it's
[1:29:05] him
[1:29:06] that you're beholding
[1:29:08] notice don't make any decisions
[1:29:11] too harshly or too quickly without first
[1:29:16] considering god about it
[1:29:18] ask him
[1:29:20] shall i do this father
[1:29:22] ask him is it your will for me to do
[1:29:25] this
[1:29:26] then see what the holy spirit
[1:29:30] will speak to you
[1:29:32] he might not give you a vision because
[1:29:34] that maybe is not how he deals with you
[1:29:37] maybe he deals with you with dreams i
[1:29:38] don't know
[1:29:39] there's ways he deals with me but i
[1:29:41] can't say that every time he's going to
[1:29:42] deal with me in that particular way
[1:29:45] but notice he may he might not give you
[1:29:47] a vision but he will speak in some way
[1:29:50] to you to let you know
[1:29:52] if you'll be sincere and ask him this is
[1:29:56] really what's key
[1:29:59] not just following an order well i know
[1:30:02] i should ask him
[1:30:03] i know i should pray and ask the lord
[1:30:05] and other things come up and maybe need
[1:30:07] to sit down with brother samuel just ask
[1:30:09] him to help me pray and i just
[1:30:11] but if you're not but if we're not
[1:30:12] sincere about it
[1:30:14] then even when god does answer
[1:30:17] we're not going to catch it
[1:30:20] but it's to really be sincere what is
[1:30:22] that faith
[1:30:24] and patience
[1:30:26] well samuel i'm talking to so and so my
[1:30:28] mama said and my daddy said mom and dad
[1:30:30] are wonderful people
[1:30:33] i love my mom and dad
[1:30:34] but i never took their word as the
[1:30:37] absolute above the leading of the holy
[1:30:39] spirit
[1:30:40] are you hearing me
[1:30:42] wonderful now my dad he was my pastor i
[1:30:45] could go to him on things as well i
[1:30:47] never looked at oh that's my daddy i
[1:30:49] would look at that and we would pray
[1:30:50] there's things that i had to pray about
[1:30:52] do i make this move do i go for this
[1:30:54] master's degree do i put in for this job
[1:30:56] do i do this and they're just saying
[1:30:57] certain things and i would just go and
[1:30:59] say would you help me to pray about this
[1:31:00] because i don't know what the mind of
[1:31:02] the lord is in this situation my heart
[1:31:04] might be pulled this way but i don't
[1:31:06] know what papa wants i don't know what
[1:31:09] he would say because i only want to do
[1:31:12] what he wants me to
[1:31:14] do never forget a year after i resigned
[1:31:18] and stepped away from teaching
[1:31:20] oh my i mean you you know i mean as much
[1:31:23] as i i love you know with pastors from
[1:31:25] the lord i loved what i did with the
[1:31:27] kids i could get to see something from
[1:31:28] start to finish you know each year and
[1:31:31] everything was going on and i never
[1:31:32] forget that here you know i talked to my
[1:31:34] principal a little bit at a certain time
[1:31:36] called her getting ready to go into that
[1:31:38] 2015 year
[1:31:40] beginning of summertime and she had told
[1:31:42] me at that time she said since you left
[1:31:44] she said our math scores have went down
[1:31:47] i said oh
[1:31:49] and she said look she said we've got a
[1:31:50] position here you just name your hours
[1:31:52] that you want
[1:31:53] and she said we need these math scores
[1:31:55] to come up she said all you'll be doing
[1:31:57] is is coming in and working with math
[1:31:59] she said you'll have full benefits and
[1:32:00] everything all that sounded really good
[1:32:05] now god had been very gracious to me
[1:32:07] in those last years
[1:32:09] even that i had taught
[1:32:11] with test scores and things like that
[1:32:13] very gracious
[1:32:14] i began to pray about it because i'll be
[1:32:16] honest i was pulled i respected my
[1:32:18] principle why was i pulled because
[1:32:22] probably like some of you i'm a person
[1:32:24] that likes helping people
[1:32:26] and sometimes i've over committed myself
[1:32:29] thank god for my lovely little wife
[1:32:30] that's been able to tell me
[1:32:32] you're over committing
[1:32:35] i thank god for my help mate
[1:32:38] remember she don't do it that way but
[1:32:40] you know what i think about it wait a
[1:32:42] minute here it's hard to say no you want
[1:32:44] to help people
[1:32:46] but i never forget when i began to pray
[1:32:48] about it and i asked her to pray about
[1:32:49] it with me
[1:32:50] and i just could not feel peace about it
[1:32:52] whatsoever
[1:32:54] and then when i called up that principal
[1:32:55] i told her i said donna i said look
[1:32:58] as much as i want to come back and help
[1:33:00] you
[1:33:00] i said i just don't feel i said that i
[1:33:03] believe that i can do that
[1:33:05] i said because when i was there
[1:33:08] i said everything else that i had going
[1:33:10] on
[1:33:11] i was in the perfect will of god at that
[1:33:14] time
[1:33:15] i said though i could come back and look
[1:33:17] at things and we could break this down
[1:33:18] and do that i said but if it's not the
[1:33:20] will of god it'll be a bigger mess than
[1:33:23] what you've got there right now
[1:33:25] because i said it ain't about me it
[1:33:27] ain't my ingenuity of looking at this
[1:33:29] curriculum and doing this and doing that
[1:33:31] and doing anything about that it's about
[1:33:33] being in the will of god
[1:33:35] and she said i can respect that she said
[1:33:37] i understand
[1:33:40] so there's things that pull at our
[1:33:42] heartstrings and let me try to just wrap
[1:33:44] this up here
[1:33:46] proverbs 3 5 trust in the lord with
[1:33:49] all thine heart
[1:33:50] and lean not
[1:33:52] unto thine own
[1:33:54] understanding
[1:33:56] if this is a scripture for the
[1:33:57] refrigerator right here
[1:33:59] this is one we need to put on the rear
[1:34:01] view mirror or your backup camera
[1:34:02] whichever one you use put it there
[1:34:06] in all thy ways acknowledge him
[1:34:09] somebody say oh
[1:34:11] all
[1:34:13] even those things that seem like i got
[1:34:15] this
[1:34:16] no in all thy ways
[1:34:19] acknowledge him
[1:34:21] he would be like brother carlos he works
[1:34:23] with the driver
[1:34:24] he would be like me going and sitting
[1:34:26] down and talking with brother drake i
[1:34:27] know he don't work with drywall
[1:34:29] and i'm asking brother drake all these
[1:34:31] questions about drywall and brother
[1:34:33] carlos is sitting right there
[1:34:35] and i don't even look at him or ask him
[1:34:38] i talk right over him
[1:34:42] that'd be really disrespectful
[1:34:46] but you see how is it when it comes to
[1:34:47] things
[1:34:48] in every aspect of our life because
[1:34:51] god's just not a drywall man
[1:34:54] he's a plumber he's a cider he
[1:34:56] you understand me he is jehovah jireh
[1:34:59] jehovah shama jehovah he's all things
[1:35:03] to all needs
[1:35:07] brother branham makes this statement you
[1:35:08] know when we look at that and he shall
[1:35:10] direct our paths
[1:35:11] ram deals with this part about us seeing
[1:35:14] the value between natural and
[1:35:16] supernatural
[1:35:18] iran likens it when they came here to
[1:35:20] this place
[1:35:22] what we read in our text
[1:35:23] he said you know they came and they
[1:35:25] approached things in a very natural way
[1:35:28] instead of in the supernatural
[1:35:32] and he said sometimes he said that's
[1:35:34] what's wrong with our services
[1:35:36] he said we come to service approaching
[1:35:39] god in a very natural way
[1:35:41] we haven't prayed about the meeting
[1:35:43] haven't prayed about it
[1:35:45] he said even meetings that's coming on
[1:35:48] you haven't prayed about it
[1:35:49] you haven't invited anybody to the
[1:35:51] meeting
[1:35:52] see it's not when we get here that we
[1:35:54] get in the spirit are you hearing me
[1:35:56] i understand thursday nights different
[1:35:58] times but listen we there there is a
[1:36:00] preparation we're coming to meet the
[1:36:03] living god
[1:36:05] and sometimes look things can become
[1:36:07] common to us that humanity can come
[1:36:09] around to where we're just you know it's
[1:36:10] just like man i'm gonna show up and hit
[1:36:12] the switch it doesn't work that way
[1:36:16] it's things that where we need we need
[1:36:18] to hear from god
[1:36:20] we need the supernatural to move among
[1:36:22] us we don't want just a natural service
[1:36:25] we want god to speak we want god to move
[1:36:28] we want the holy ghost to have the right
[1:36:30] of way we want deliverance feelings and
[1:36:33] healings we want the supernatural notice
[1:36:36] they were in the natural and jehoshaphat
[1:36:39] was in the natural with them righteous
[1:36:42] man who loved the lord god fearing man
[1:36:44] believer on and on and on and on and on
[1:36:47] he started getting under the wrong
[1:36:48] influence
[1:36:52] all of a sudden jehoshaphat nobody else
[1:36:54] he's the one that pipes up whoa
[1:36:58] we need to consult the lord
[1:37:01] we messed up we shouldn't even we
[1:37:03] shouldn't even be here in this situation
[1:37:05] but we need to consult the lord is there
[1:37:08] somebody that we can get to consult the
[1:37:10] lord
[1:37:12] and when they brought elisha
[1:37:15] the atmosphere still wasn't right
[1:37:18] so they had to change
[1:37:21] the atmosphere
[1:37:23] and sometimes in our life
[1:37:25] here we are under those spell
[1:37:28] pity all those things
[1:37:30] now i'm just going to flip the switch
[1:37:32] and grant the prayer no you've got to
[1:37:34] change the atmosphere
[1:37:36] that's why even when brother branham
[1:37:38] would speak to us about coming into the
[1:37:39] house of god
[1:37:41] early
[1:37:44] getting out get ourselves in an
[1:37:46] atmosphere that's why we don't want no
[1:37:48] moving around any if it's not necessary
[1:37:51] it's like i've told the sound guys the
[1:37:52] song leaders don't be moving around in
[1:37:54] here if it's not necessary if it's stuff
[1:37:57] if it's a broken microphone we'll preach
[1:37:59] with another one
[1:38:01] unless i need batteries then we'll stop
[1:38:03] everything
[1:38:04] understand what i'm saying we're not
[1:38:05] talking i'm not talking about being
[1:38:06] dogmatic friends but i'm talking about
[1:38:08] to recognize an atmosphere that there is
[1:38:11] an atmosphere about our lives when i
[1:38:14] come to the house of god i don't want to
[1:38:15] have to be saying man i hope brother
[1:38:17] william's in a good atmosphere because i
[1:38:18] need some of that atmosphere to rub off
[1:38:20] on me no i want to be in the right
[1:38:23] atmosphere
[1:38:25] because i don't want to be well 1 minus
[1:38:28] 1 equals zero no i want to unite my
[1:38:31] pillar fire with that pillar of fire we
[1:38:34] want an atmosphere set in this place of
[1:38:36] the supernatural because when we come
[1:38:39] here we are consoling the lord there are
[1:38:43] things we've prayed about things we've
[1:38:45] been asking god for and seeking god for
[1:38:48] and god comes here and he answers this
[1:38:50] is one of the avenues
[1:38:53] that he uses
[1:38:56] to answer
[1:39:01] can i read these scriptures as we close
[1:39:05] paul said pray always
[1:39:07] with all prayer and supplication in the
[1:39:08] spirit
[1:39:10] watching there unto with all
[1:39:12] perseverance
[1:39:13] and supplication for all saints
[1:39:17] continue in prayer and watch in the same
[1:39:19] with thanksgiving
[1:39:21] first peter 4 7
[1:39:23] the end of all things is at hand be you
[1:39:24] therefore sober that means
[1:39:26] your right mind is focused
[1:39:29] and watch
[1:39:30] unto prayer
[1:39:33] you see all this right here
[1:39:35] as we look at it
[1:39:38] but it all comes down to
[1:39:40] when we see this consoling
[1:39:43] the will of the lord
[1:39:46] because like jehoshaphat
[1:39:48] we must have the reality
[1:39:50] that our biggest enemy
[1:39:53] is ourselves
[1:39:56] brother never said my biggest enemy is
[1:39:58] so-and-so
[1:39:59] he said william branham
[1:40:01] is my greatest enemy
[1:40:03] he said he's the one that gets lazy
[1:40:06] he's the one that gets in the way
[1:40:08] you can put your name in it as well your
[1:40:10] family is no different mine is no
[1:40:12] different either
[1:40:13] he said when
[1:40:14] it's something i feel like i can do
[1:40:16] about it and when i feel like i can do
[1:40:17] something about it it just shoves god
[1:40:19] right out of the picture
[1:40:21] but when i can get that guy out of the
[1:40:22] way
[1:40:25] what's one of the ways we get
[1:40:27] samuel out of the way what's one of the
[1:40:29] ways you get drake out of the way dave
[1:40:31] david shane
[1:40:33] paul
[1:40:34] brian go ahead and call anybody's name
[1:40:39] what's one of the ways we get
[1:40:41] this guy out of the way
[1:40:44] is when we
[1:40:45] submit ourselves
[1:40:47] to the word
[1:40:49] and allowing the word to wash us
[1:40:52] taking in of the word listening to the
[1:40:55] message
[1:40:56] of the hour
[1:40:58] reading our bible
[1:41:00] praying
[1:41:02] asking god to reveal himself to us it's
[1:41:06] becoming acquainted more with him
[1:41:10] my wife
[1:41:12] i know her more now
[1:41:14] she can read me like a book i can read
[1:41:16] her like a book i know she knows
[1:41:20] it's a wonderful thing
[1:41:23] we know one another
[1:41:25] that's a oneness that didn't come at the
[1:41:27] altar
[1:41:29] what happened at the altar
[1:41:31] only allow for that fellowship to move
[1:41:34] in a deeper manner and continue to
[1:41:37] blossom
[1:41:38] through all the tests
[1:41:40] and trials of life
[1:41:42] where we learn one another
[1:41:44] we know one another that's
[1:41:47] that's in a very small way
[1:41:50] of how it is in a great way
[1:41:52] with christ
[1:41:53] and his bride
[1:41:55] we become acquainted with him
[1:41:58] to where we recognize certain things no
[1:42:00] no like my wife could tell you
[1:42:04] sam don't even don't even bake it he
[1:42:07] won't like it
[1:42:11] so some of you think i'm picky
[1:42:15] pray for me
[1:42:16] [Laughter]
[1:42:19] i'm not picky i'm just picky about some
[1:42:21] things
[1:42:22] but my wife could tell you on certain
[1:42:23] things
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:26] i'm not a big olive guy it might be good
[1:42:28] to flavor stuff i'm not a big olive guy
[1:42:30] i pick it out of the rice
[1:42:32] move them grenades to the side
[1:42:35] and give them to my wife
[1:42:37] but she can tell you if you're gonna
[1:42:38] make give me oh
[1:42:40] for pastor appreciation oh we're going
[1:42:42] to give brother samuel a jar of olives
[1:42:45] she could tell you
[1:42:46] don't
[1:42:47] that would not be appreciation that
[1:42:49] would be an insult
[1:42:50] [Laughter]
[1:42:53] but think about that with the lord jesus
[1:42:55] you see the more closer you are as
[1:42:58] you're feeding on the message
[1:43:00] listening to taking it in
[1:43:02] praying seeking after him
[1:43:06] you start you recognize him more quickly
[1:43:10] you start picking up on certain things
[1:43:11] the discernment our discernment moves
[1:43:14] deeper
[1:43:15] and deeper
[1:43:17] because we're warring against
[1:43:19] this great enemy
[1:43:21] let's pray
[1:43:24] heavenly father
[1:43:27] inquiring
[1:43:29] of the lord
[1:43:32] father
[1:43:35] there's no doubt lord
[1:43:37] every one of us right here
[1:43:39] things that
[1:43:41] we would have upon our hearts
[1:43:44] seeking your will about
[1:43:48] and lord help us
[1:43:51] to lord
[1:43:52] draw and to glean from these things
[1:43:55] tonight
[1:43:56] realizing that lord
[1:43:58] the things that even you spoke to us
[1:44:00] tonight is not something that's just as
[1:44:02] due to just quickly like the snap of a
[1:44:05] finger to change us as far as
[1:44:08] how things will go but lord it opens to
[1:44:10] us that reality that
[1:44:12] lord we just
[1:44:14] we need and we want to live so close to
[1:44:17] you
[1:44:18] we don't want to take anything for
[1:44:20] granted we see that like your prophet
[1:44:22] put it with jehoshaphat
[1:44:24] every one of us
[1:44:25] have been identified right here
[1:44:29] lord we thank you for your grace and how
[1:44:32] that you have moved even to correct us
[1:44:35] maybe lord even here tonight with things
[1:44:37] that you've moved lord with your
[1:44:39] sovereign grace to bring correction in
[1:44:41] our life and give us direction to let us
[1:44:43] know lord it's a care
[1:44:46] it's a care it's a nurturing that's
[1:44:49] taking place
[1:44:51] may we just lord just continue to yield
[1:44:54] of our lives to you
[1:44:56] if there's a life lord i think how
[1:44:58] brother branham would place it lord in
[1:45:00] this in this very service lord where he
[1:45:03] would talk about consulting you
[1:45:06] and he would speak about if there's a
[1:45:08] need that arises in your life
[1:45:10] let's see what the lord will say about
[1:45:12] it
[1:45:14] if there's an affliction a time of
[1:45:16] trouble a cancer
[1:45:18] let's let's see what the lord will say
[1:45:20] about it
[1:45:22] we hear what the doctors we know these
[1:45:24] things but let's see what papa says
[1:45:26] about it
[1:45:28] for the round and lord as he tells us he
[1:45:30] said i'm a drunkard i'm a harlot i've
[1:45:32] cursed all my life don't give up let's
[1:45:33] consult the lord about it right now
[1:45:36] let's see what he's saying about it
[1:45:39] brother branham i've tried for six years
[1:45:41] to be born again of the spirit of god to
[1:45:43] receive the holy spirit he's never come
[1:45:45] to me yet well let's try again tonight
[1:45:47] and see what the lord will say
[1:45:49] because he's always willing
[1:45:52] if we'll just get everything out of the
[1:45:53] way
[1:45:57] lord jesus
[1:46:00] help us
[1:46:04] lord we realize this
[1:46:07] if we lord can say this and really
[1:46:10] realize
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:12] we can say this lord that our own self
[1:46:15] is our biggest enemy
[1:46:18] but lord sometimes i really don't think
[1:46:19] we believe it
[1:46:21] and i include myself in that boy me me
[1:46:23] too
[1:46:25] [Music]
[1:46:27] help us lord
[1:46:29] because lord as we can live close to you
[1:46:32] our lives there's a maturing and we
[1:46:35] become lord even more acquainted
[1:46:38] with your nature your character your
[1:46:41] work
[1:46:43] through that intimate fellowship
[1:46:46] then lord god
[1:46:48] we find in our lives we see
[1:46:50] our weaknesses
[1:46:53] when moses was in your presence
[1:46:56] before that time oh he knew about things
[1:46:59] in his life
[1:47:01] but lord in that time
[1:47:03] his weaknesses
[1:47:05] was
[1:47:06] exposed lord i believe that god that as
[1:47:10] we as believers live in the presence of
[1:47:12] god
[1:47:14] or feasting feeding on the word of god
[1:47:18] help us lord all throughout this
[1:47:19] assembly those are streaming those are
[1:47:21] archived
[1:47:23] or god
[1:47:24] if they've not been giving themselves to
[1:47:26] feed on the word
[1:47:28] and to pray
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:30] lord jesus
[1:47:32] may they see the value in
[1:47:35] may they see the value
[1:47:37] of the atmosphere when we come in here
[1:47:39] to the house of god
[1:47:42] the atmosphere lord that it's
[1:47:44] with a supernatural lord god where we
[1:47:46] are looking and we are praying
[1:47:48] it don't matter if we're on our way from
[1:47:50] work on thursday night if we can just
[1:47:52] pray in the car and say lord jesus
[1:47:55] come down tonight lord come speak lord
[1:47:57] to our hearts
[1:47:58] lord god forgive me in my thoughts or
[1:48:00] cleanse me lord from the day lord god
[1:48:02] i'm going to the house of god i want to
[1:48:04] join my lick of fire with the rest lord
[1:48:06] i want their lord to be
[1:48:09] a real moving of the supernatural i've
[1:48:11] got needs i've got things the lord that
[1:48:13] need to be spoken to in my life things
[1:48:15] that i've prayed about things lord
[1:48:17] that's on my heart lord
[1:48:19] father i know not only me but every one
[1:48:21] of your children
[1:48:23] but god how do we know
[1:48:26] that just that atmosphere as it's joined
[1:48:28] together it creates such a bank of faith
[1:48:31] that there might be a life that's in
[1:48:33] here that is being tormented
[1:48:36] to where the enemy has been wanting to
[1:48:38] assail and come against him
[1:48:40] as though that there's no hope for him
[1:48:42] there's no chance for him you don't
[1:48:44] understand this but there can be an
[1:48:45] atmosphere of the supernatural that can
[1:48:48] be charged oh god that'll push back that
[1:48:51] enemy lord god
[1:48:53] it'll push it back lord and give
[1:48:55] strength
[1:48:56] to that life lord to reach out
[1:48:59] and who knows
[1:49:00] that might be the very
[1:49:03] day
[1:49:05] that they're born again
[1:49:07] help us lord
[1:49:09] help us father
[1:49:12] may we consult you lord in every matter
[1:49:14] may we not just come to the house of god
[1:49:16] and just say well i made it
[1:49:18] and show up but may we come lord with
[1:49:20] the real
[1:49:21] supernatural expectation
[1:49:24] even when we don't feel like it but may
[1:49:26] we pray may we lord god just say lord
[1:49:29] let there be an atmosphere created
[1:49:31] around my life lord to where my brother
[1:49:34] my sister lord maybe that they're going
[1:49:35] through a hard trial a hard test or
[1:49:37] something's going on i i want it to be
[1:49:39] an atmosphere
[1:49:41] that we don't have to wait and the
[1:49:42] preacher don't have to preach for 45
[1:49:44] minutes to have 15 minutes that when the
[1:49:46] anointing finally comes
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:49:49] i wanted to be an atmosphere that right
[1:49:51] there
[1:49:52] when they sat down behind the piano the
[1:49:54] organ there's an atmosphere already
[1:49:58] in place in the house of god
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:03] i wonder if our heads are bowed how many
[1:50:05] would want to be remembered in prayer
[1:50:06] maybe there's something up on your heart
[1:50:07] something you're praying about if it's
