[45:03] amen God bless you well I feel pretty
[45:06] free today amen praise the Lord if you
[45:09] have your Bibles this morning we're
[45:10] going to look into a couple places here
[45:11] we're going to look into Jeremiah the
[45:14] 32nd
[45:15] chapter and then we'll also be looking
[45:17] in 2 Corinthians the 4th
[45:21] chapter and uh just want to greet you
[45:24] once again in the name of the Lord amen
[45:26] God is good to us and uh what more can
[45:30] we say to these things God be for us who
[45:34] can be against us yes sir Jeremiah the
[45:37] 32nd
[45:39] chapter and uh for context the Prophet
[45:43] Jeremiah and these people Israel they're
[45:45] getting ready to go into the Captivity
[45:47] they're going to be in captivity for 70
[45:49] years here in Babylon and the word of
[45:52] the Lord comes to Jeremiah here in the
[45:53] sixth verse it says and Jeremiah said
[45:56] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[45:57] behold Hanam the son of shalum thine
[46:01] Uncle shall come unto thee saying bu
[46:04] thee my field that is in anathoth for
[46:06] the right of redemption is thine to buy
[46:10] it so Hanam my uncle's son came to me in
[46:13] the court of the prison according to the
[46:15] word of the Lord and said unto me by my
[46:17] field I pray thee that is in anoth which
[46:20] is in the country of Benjamin for the
[46:22] right of inheritance is thine and the
[46:24] Redemption is thine by for
[46:27] thyself then I knew that this was the
[46:30] word of the Lord and I bought the field
[46:32] of Hanan uncle's son that was an anoth
[46:36] and weighed him the money even 17
[46:39] shekels of silver and I subscribed the
[46:42] evidence and sealed it and took
[46:43] Witnesses and weighed him the money in
[46:46] the
[46:47] balances notice here so I took the
[46:49] evidence of the purchase both that which
[46:51] was sealed according to the law and
[46:54] custom and that which was open I gave
[46:57] the evidence of the purchase unto baroo
[46:59] the son of narah the son of mas in the
[47:02] sight of hanil my uncle's son in the
[47:05] presence of the witnesses that
[47:06] subscribed the book of the purchase
[47:08] before all the Jews that sat in the
[47:10] court of the prison and I charged baroo
[47:12] before them saying thus sayith the Lord
[47:15] of hosts the god of Israel take these
[47:18] evidences this evidence of the purchase
[47:21] both that which is sealed and this
[47:23] evidence which is
[47:24] open this is curious and put them in an
[47:27] earth and vessel that they may continue
[47:31] many days for thus sayith the Lord of
[47:33] hosts the god of Israel houses and
[47:35] Fields and Vineyards shall be possessed
[47:38] again in this
[47:40] land 2 Corinthians the 4th
[47:45] chapter let's read verses 5 to8 the
[47:48] Apostle Paul here speaking by the spirit
[47:50] of God and he says this for we preach
[47:53] not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord
[47:56] a lot of preachers would do really well
[47:57] if they did that amen Lord help us not
[47:59] to preach ourselves this morning but
[48:00] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[48:03] servants for Jesus s notice for God who
[48:07] commanded the light to shine out of
[48:08] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[48:11] give the light of the knowledge of the
[48:13] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[48:17] but we have this treasure this light of
[48:19] this knowledge we have this treasure in
[48:21] Earth and vessels and now notice the
[48:23] reason why that the Excellency of the
[48:26] power may be of God and not us may the
[48:31] Lord bless the ring his word you may be
[48:32] seated
[48:35] today I'd like to speak on a thought
[48:37] today you know I'm I'm not I asked my
[48:40] kids I had a title for this I thought it
[48:42] was really cool and it sounds like I'm a
[48:44] boomer or something so now now I got
[48:47] cold feet I'm not going to do
[48:49] it um I'm G preach on uh just evidences
[48:53] of redemption evidences of redemption I
[48:55] like this in Jeremiah 32 because there's
[48:58] there's two evidences of course we know
[48:59] according to the scripture that that in
[49:01] the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[49:02] every testimonies to be established amen
[49:05] and so we talk about the evidence of
[49:06] redemption and actually just had a
[49:08] brother talk to me about it yesterday a
[49:09] little bit you know uh people throughout
[49:11] the church changes they've looked for
[49:14] evidence of redemption amen the
[49:15] Methodist used to say when you shouted
[49:17] you had it amen and the Pentecost used
[49:19] to say well if you spoke in tongues you
[49:21] had it or if you did this you put your
[49:22] name on a book you shake hands with the
[49:24] preacher they're looking for an Evidence
[49:26] of Redemption amen but but God is The
[49:29] Interpreter of his own word amen God is
[49:32] The Interpreter of his own word and uh
[49:34] we recognize and this is the point I was
[49:36] trying to get at if you could look at a
[49:38] natural physical evidence say well this
[49:39] person did that so they're saved and
[49:41] this person does that so they're saved
[49:43] your confidence would be in the physical
[49:45] manifestation of it and not the one that
[49:47] made the promise amen if you could look
[49:50] at speaking in Tong and say well I spoke
[49:51] in Tong now nothing against speaking in
[49:52] tongues amen we believe that right I get
[49:55] a couple more amens that amen that's not
[49:58] Pentecost it's just the word amen we
[50:00] believe in that amen but if you take
[50:03] that and you make that the evidence say
[50:05] well listen I spoke in tongues I've got
[50:07] the Holy Ghost your confidence is in the
[50:08] fact you spoke in tongues not in the one
[50:11] who gives it amen because John said I've
[50:14] baptized you listen lots of people got
[50:16] baptized by John said I indeed baptized
[50:18] you with water but the one that comes
[50:20] after me he's mightier than I he shall
[50:23] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[50:27] fire so I can't baptize you with the
[50:30] Holy Ghost no man can do Christ gives
[50:32] the Holy Ghost he's the one that made
[50:35] the promise and he's the one that
[50:36] fulfills it he's The Interpreter of his
[50:38] own word amen now let me just say this
[50:41] we know according to the message only
[50:42] the predestinated are considered in
[50:44] Redemption so we're talking about
[50:46] Redemption today we're talking about the
[50:48] predestinated we're talking about the
[50:49] Sons and Daughters of God that were forn
[50:51] of God before the foundation of the
[50:54] world
[50:55] Amen so God this this is what I'm
[50:56] getting at God did not predestinate a
[50:58] church like a Methodist Church or a
[51:01] Baptist Church or a Catholic Church he
[51:03] didn't even PR predestinate a bride like
[51:05] a church he predestines
[51:08] individuals they have his attributes and
[51:11] those attributes gathered together they
[51:13] make up the body of Christ so it's not
[51:16] it's not a carnal Association it's not
[51:18] about where we go it's about our
[51:20] position in Christ amen amen so this
[51:24] idea of redemption it's it's a great
[51:26] subject to undertake it's probably one
[51:27] of the penultimate things we could talk
[51:29] about amen and we talk we think about
[51:31] this when brother R preaches the opening
[51:33] of the seals in
[51:34] 1963 what is being open to the people
[51:37] the book of redemption the book of
[51:40] redemption is the thing that Adam lost
[51:43] the book of redemption is the thing that
[51:45] according to a prophet according to
[51:47] Malachi 4 has been restored a mighty
[51:51] angel came down Hallelujah somebody a
[51:53] mighty angel came down with an open book
[51:56] and he gave this book to John he gave
[51:59] the book To Us amen everything that Adam
[52:02] lost it has been restored today to the
[52:05] Bride of Jesus Christ they as
[52:07] individuals there's one here there's one
[52:10] there they come together they've got
[52:12] their liif fire today they're the
[52:14] redeemed they're the possessors they're
[52:17] the ones with the book
[52:19] amen so we look at this brother B when
[52:22] he's preaching the seals and he's
[52:23] preaching the breach between the seven
[52:25] Church chases and the Seven Seals he
[52:26] actually references this book of
[52:28] Jeremiah the 32nd chapter so uh and he
[52:31] makes the point list in the book that
[52:33] Jeremiah had it's not a four cornered
[52:35] book like we use nowadays where it's got
[52:37] It's a scroll it's rolled up amen so as
[52:40] you unfurl this scroll as you unravel
[52:42] these seals consecutively one after
[52:45] another they're breaking it's it's it's
[52:46] all one piece of paper can I say it that
[52:49] way it's it's not a bunch of different
[52:50] pieces it's it's one word it's one
[52:52] scroll it's one Lord One Faith it's one
[52:56] baptism Amen brother B said the scroll
[52:58] is here we know it was there we know
[53:01] that it was Redemption we believed it
[53:02] was Redemption jeremi said this scroll
[53:05] must be kept he says as you read it
[53:07] there he'll say it must be kept in an
[53:09] Earthly
[53:10] vessel he says oh my what a beautiful
[53:13] thing I could talk about a while well
[53:14] I'm fixing too since he didn't talk
[53:16] about that much there but there you go
[53:18] he says the scroll was kept in an
[53:20] Earthly vessel a vessel that once became
[53:23] flesh he says Glory
[53:26] he got a little excited about that one
[53:28] amen a vessel that once became flesh
[53:30] died and rose again and kept in an
[53:33] Earthly vessel until the time of
[53:35] purchase brother B says in the first
[53:37] seal that's the way the whole Bible was
[53:38] wrote in Scrolls he says and so to break
[53:41] these seals it opens the mystery of the
[53:44] book and then he says did you get to
[53:45] study Jeremiah man that's a good teacher
[53:47] did you look that up
[53:50] yet this is a whole another side story
[53:52] but uh to make my point you know I
[53:54] worked with a woman years ago and she
[53:56] was raised Catholic she wasn't even a
[53:57] practicing Catholic and and she uh she
[54:00] come up to me one day she's like well
[54:01] you just think you're better than
[54:01] everybody else I'm like well no not
[54:03] really don't know what I did to offend
[54:04] her
[54:05] but you just think because you read the
[54:07] Bible and you do all this stuff it makes
[54:08] you special no I'm God made me special
[54:11] that's why I do all that stuff I didn't
[54:13] quite say it that way but well she's
[54:15] like I want you to know I believe just
[54:17] the same way as you do you know and so I
[54:18] said well um I I reference the scripture
[54:21] in the book of Acts where the Bible said
[54:23] they're the disciples were first called
[54:25] Christians in Antioch and make I was
[54:26] making the point that Christians they're
[54:28] disciples they're discipline they apply
[54:31] themselves to it I said I want you to go
[54:32] look this scripture up when you get home
[54:34] and then tell me what you think about it
[54:35] and I would come back for weeks every
[54:37] week i' be like hey did you look that up
[54:38] yet no I didn't look it up yet do you
[54:39] look it up yet no I didn't look it up I
[54:41] finally let it go she one day like
[54:43] listen it's still it's sitting right
[54:44] there on my table I'm like and that's
[54:45] all the further it's going to go wow
[54:48] amen so I like this brother's like I
[54:50] want you to catch in other words did you
[54:52] get to look up Jeremiah so if you get a
[54:53] chance go home look it up
[54:58] but he said did you get to study
[54:59] Jeremiah how he wrote that many of you
[55:01] taken it down last night how them seals
[55:03] were wrote and placed away for keeping
[55:05] until he returned after 70 years of the
[55:09] Captivity so I like this it's one scroll
[55:11] it's one piece that's why brother B says
[55:13] that any true Revelation that comes from
[55:16] God it'll run from Genesis to revelation
[55:19] God has a continuity he doesn't need an
[55:21] Editor to make sure that the lore and
[55:23] his story lines up he is the word and
[55:25] his continuity is perfect no scripture
[55:28] can be broken there's no variance
[55:30] there's no disagreement people think
[55:32] there are but there's not this word is
[55:36] perfect in itself it doesn't need an
[55:38] interpreter it doesn't need a an
[55:40] addendum it doesn't need rewrote or
[55:42] updated it's perfect amen so we're
[55:44] talking about this evidences of
[55:46] redemption it's plural it's two amen and
[55:49] so it's like I said you know in the
[55:50] mouth of two or three Witnesses every
[55:52] word's established and I want you to
[55:54] think about your confession this morning
[55:56] amen
[55:57] cuz you want to look at at at at
[55:59] evidences of of the life that you have
[56:02] what what did you used to be and what
[56:04] are you now what made the change amen
[56:07] because when God comes to live inside a
[56:09] man or woman it changes the way they
[56:12] speak amen their circumstances are no
[56:14] longer just circumstances they're
[56:16] they're they they're opportunities for
[56:18] the glory of God Amen you look at trials
[56:20] different you look at situations
[56:22] different you look at outcomes different
[56:24] and you recognize that God is working in
[56:26] your life amen so we would to have the
[56:28] right kind of a confession the Bible
[56:30] says if you believe in the heart and you
[56:31] confess with the mouth you'll be saved
[56:34] amen Paul said that that and he's
[56:36] quoting David David said I've believed
[56:39] therefore I have spoken and Paul says we
[56:41] believe therefore we also speak amen so
[56:45] I want you to think this morning about
[56:47] what you speak over your lives there's
[56:49] power in your words death and life are
[56:52] in the power of your tongue today amen
[56:54] if you're a redeemed individual idual it
[56:57] does you no good unless you speak like a
[56:59] redeemed individual amen you've got to
[57:01] speak life over your home Speak Life
[57:03] over your situation amen we're so used
[57:06] to speaking negativity because it's all
[57:08] around us it's what the media puts out
[57:11] because it sells papers it sells
[57:12] subscriptions it sells podcast
[57:15] everything's negative but we've got the
[57:17] positive we've got something that's
[57:19] greater than the economy we've got
[57:21] something that's greater than the
[57:23] government we've got something that's
[57:24] greater than Co today amen
[57:27] Hallelujah Galatians 4:6 the Bible says
[57:30] this because you are Sons I love that he
[57:33] didn't say if you do this you'll be Sons
[57:35] but because you're already Sons because
[57:37] God fornew you because you were part of
[57:39] God's thing because you are Sons God has
[57:42] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[57:44] your hearts crying ABA
[57:47] father that's what is he doing he's
[57:50] saying what you're saying he's he's ling
[57:53] a witness to your confession amen the
[57:55] book of Romans 8 says the spirit itself
[57:58] it Bears witness with our spirit that we
[58:01] are the children we are the sons of God
[58:04] listen anybody can walk into a church
[58:07] and call themselves The Son of God right
[58:10] but when God says you're a Son of God
[58:13] that's what makes the difference listen
[58:15] the Jews they accuse Jesus of blasphemy
[58:18] well you're making yourself God he said
[58:20] my witness isn't of myself my father
[58:23] Bears witness The Works bear Witness
[58:26] I don't have to stick up for just me
[58:28] today and hope you believe it God has
[58:30] given us a witness that's what the
[58:32] message is
[58:34] about that shows sunship it shows your
[58:37] predestination amen I love it because
[58:40] brother talks about that China man you
[58:42] know that story talks about the China
[58:43] man with the laundry he said he's got a
[58:44] better system than we do today and it's
[58:46] still better than what we got even now
[58:48] today amen because you can make up
[58:50] numbers you can fabricate sheets but
[58:51] that China man he couldn't read numbers
[58:53] or read English or anything you'd go
[58:56] take your garment to the to the dry
[58:57] cleaner and say I want this China man I
[58:59] want him to clean my laundry and he take
[59:01] a piece of paper and he tear it a
[59:03] certain way and give you half of
[59:05] it now you've got a piece and I've got a
[59:08] piece and if you want your suit back you
[59:11] want your favorite dress back amen it
[59:14] doesn't matter how much money you put
[59:15] down it doesn't matter what date you
[59:17] come in or what numbers you write on it
[59:18] does the piece that you got that's the
[59:21] pieace that he's
[59:22] got cuz everyone is T different
[59:25] everyone's and only one piece in the
[59:28] world will fit that
[59:30] piece there's only one because it come
[59:32] from the same piece it come from the
[59:34] same fabric there's only one that's
[59:36] going to match and we've had churches
[59:38] churches we've had Brides brides but
[59:41] there's only one that will line up with
[59:44] every word that will punctuate every
[59:46] word of God with an
[59:49] amen that so she's made of a different
[59:51] kind of material that's bride material
[59:54] there
[59:57] oh my my
[59:59] Hallelujah brother br's in uh believe it
[1:00:02] was Clifton's Cafeteria one day and he's
[1:00:03] preaching he gets
[1:00:04] done and the uh I think it was Danny
[1:00:07] Henry comes that could have been the
[1:00:08] 23rd Book of Revelation he said well I
[1:00:10] appreciate that but God can't add to his
[1:00:12] word can't take away from it and he gets
[1:00:15] to there and I believe he hugs brother
[1:00:16] BR he begins to speak in tongues and
[1:00:18] there's three different interpreters
[1:00:19] there there's one from the UN there's
[1:00:21] another they all speak
[1:00:22] French and so they begin to take the
[1:00:25] interpretation one writes it down one
[1:00:26] speaks it they've all got the brother B
[1:00:28] said they all had the exact same
[1:00:31] interpretation even to the punctuation
[1:00:33] why cuz they heard the same thing three
[1:00:36] different people had the same thing they
[1:00:38] said cuz they heard the same original
[1:00:40] amen so even though there was three
[1:00:42] different people they all had one
[1:00:44] interpretation it was the correct
[1:00:46] interpretation cuz they knew
[1:00:49] French now I don't know French but I
[1:00:51] know the Lord amen sometimes I pretend I
[1:00:54] know French but I don't know French
[1:00:58] amen they all have it's they don't have
[1:01:01] three different interpretations they
[1:01:03] actually have the same interpretation
[1:01:05] it's just in the mouth of two or three
[1:01:07] Witnesses
[1:01:09] Amen brother B says this in the Paradox
[1:01:11] message we'll cross Jordan the
[1:01:13] separation now he's talking about this
[1:01:14] in 1961 he said God break to us the
[1:01:17] seals on the back of the book let let us
[1:01:20] enter into this great place now for
[1:01:22] Joshua divided to the people their
[1:01:26] inheritance that God had left for them
[1:01:29] so what is the evidence speaking of the
[1:01:31] same thing it's spoke of for Jeremiah
[1:01:33] it's your inheritance it speaks about
[1:01:35] what family you're from it speaks about
[1:01:38] what belongs to you it speaks about your
[1:01:40] privileges and your rights to that
[1:01:41] property amen so the opening of the
[1:01:44] seals is not just identifying what is
[1:01:46] yours but who you
[1:01:48] are amen the scripture says in Romans
[1:01:51] the 5th chapter for if when we were
[1:01:53] enemies we were reconciled to God by the
[1:01:56] death of his son much more being
[1:01:59] reconciled we shall be saved by his
[1:02:03] life in other words if God already done
[1:02:06] saved you how much more can he do for
[1:02:08] you today amen how much more is he going
[1:02:11] to redeem you today amen he did not save
[1:02:14] you to lose you he did not find you to
[1:02:17] forget you amen but if he's interested
[1:02:20] in you if he's got evidence of you that
[1:02:22] you belong it shows his interest in
[1:02:25] Redemption
[1:02:26] he could have left it in the piggy bank
[1:02:28] he could have left it in the Security
[1:02:30] Vault amen but he's presented evidence
[1:02:33] through the message of this day and say
[1:02:34] I'm interested in redeeming this bride
[1:02:37] unto myself this is the time this is the
[1:02:40] hour this is the season Jeremiah knew
[1:02:43] when 70 years had ended when the
[1:02:45] Captivity was over when it was time to
[1:02:47] go to the Homeland there would be
[1:02:49] somebody to pick that scroll up to dig
[1:02:52] up that Earth and vessel and say this
[1:02:54] belongs to me it's it's mine it was paid
[1:02:57] for and I've got my
[1:03:01] receipt something I learned to do a long
[1:03:03] time ago I keep all my
[1:03:05] receipts both figuratively and literally
[1:03:07] I keep them all I stick them in a paper

[1:03:13] out I learned to do this years ago I I
[1:03:16] read a I I mentioned a quote one time in
[1:03:18] a service and this this is years ago I

[1:03:27] little dicey so I went and I looked it
[1:03:30] up I found it like five different places
[1:03:31] in the message I printed it all out I
[1:03:33] brought it back to church the next night
[1:03:35] he didn't even show
[1:03:37] up I see how you
[1:03:40] are so I keep my receipts know when I

[1:03:50] it's easier when you got a search
[1:03:53] engine Heen it's not just one listen
[1:03:55] it's one thing to know what the Bible or
[1:03:57] the message says it's another thing when
[1:03:59] you get into it yourself and you say
[1:04:01] listen I can take you to the very spot
[1:04:04] where I purchase this redemp where God
[1:04:05] purchased this Redemption for me I can

[1:04:51] ago or 20 years ago or even 40 years ago

[1:05:15] the issue today right listen purchasing
[1:05:17] power listen it's already paid for if he
[1:05:20] had to he would bankrupt heaven to keep
[1:05:23] his promises
[1:05:25] the solvy of God's ability to purchase
[1:05:28] your Redemption is no longer in question

[1:06:04] Reformation we have
[1:06:06] restoration it's been put back you hear
[1:06:09] me son put back to the way it was in the
[1:06:12] beginning brother talks about this in
[1:06:14] the rising of the sun he says you can
[1:06:15] get a title yeah you can get a title to
[1:06:18] a place think about I tell you what
[1:06:20] don't get me started on property rights

[1:06:24] always get here
[1:06:27] you can buy a place oh here I am you can
[1:06:30] buy a place and you can own it for 30
[1:06:32] years and you can pay taxes on it and
[1:06:35] guess what happens when you don't pay
[1:06:36] taxes one time they start coming after
[1:06:39] you I thought I owned it how could you
[1:06:42] take well praise the Lord
[1:06:45] somebody you can get a title to a place
[1:06:48] listen there's a bowling alley there in
[1:06:49] in vanward Ohio where I live and it's
[1:06:51] got It's got a it's got a thing on the
[1:06:53] title if somebody buys this property
[1:06:56] they can't make it another bowling alley
[1:06:57] you know who bought it the other bowling
[1:06:58] alley in town cuz they didn't want any
[1:07:00] competition so they put a little claws
[1:07:02] in there listen if you buy this other
[1:07:03] alley you can't be our competitor nobody
[1:07:06] wants to buy it now the property's fine
[1:07:10] the machine's fine but nobody wants it
[1:07:12] because there's a little sentence on
[1:07:13] there that little thing is held against
[1:07:16] whoever would buy that nobody wants it
[1:07:18] for a bowling alley nobody wants it for
[1:07:20] anything it's been sitting there and
[1:07:21] sitting there I think finally somebody
[1:07:22] bought it and made a restaurant or
[1:07:23] something I it I don't know but is that
[1:07:25] right right my wife I'm glad I brought
[1:07:27] see my
[1:07:29] receipt she's usually the
[1:07:32] receipt but nobody would buy it for
[1:07:34] years because of that amen one little
[1:07:36] thing see you can buy the title and
[1:07:38] that's fine he says you can get a title
[1:07:39] place but that don't say it's yours no
[1:07:42] sir somebody way back Yonder could come
[1:07:44] in and put a claim on it but when you
[1:07:47] get an
[1:07:48] abstract when you get the original it
[1:07:50] shows that everything that's ever
[1:07:52] against it is struck off PL back from
[1:07:56] the foundation is that right he says
[1:07:58] when a man has said that he believes the
[1:08:00] word then when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:08:03] it's the abstract to the title it gives
[1:08:06] you permission somebody say I got
[1:08:08] permission it gives you
[1:08:11] permission you don't have to ask anybody
[1:08:13] you've got permission it gives you
[1:08:15] permission when you have the abstract
[1:08:17] every bit of that belongs to you
[1:08:20] everything that's on it belongs to
[1:08:22] you he says that gives us the abstract
[1:08:25] with the Holy Ghost comes upon this
[1:08:27] title deed that God saw but back Yonder
[1:08:30] before the foundation of the world put
[1:08:32] it in a book of life it was but it was
[1:08:34] born through a man or a woman it was
[1:08:37] subject to sin guilty of sin when I
[1:08:41] believed on it I received the deed but
[1:08:43] when the Holy Ghost
[1:08:45] come it was the abstract that everything
[1:08:48] against me whether my mother done it my
[1:08:50] father done it it's gone
[1:08:53] amen we've got a token to it's an
[1:08:55] abstract I want you to recognize in
[1:08:57] Luther's day Luther had the word for his
[1:09:00] day he had Reformation but he didn't
[1:09:02] have the original word can I say it this
[1:09:04] way there was a lean there's some things
[1:09:06] against Luther you could look at Luther
[1:09:07] and say but I yet I have something
[1:09:09] against you it's not the full word amen
[1:09:12] it wasn't ready for Redemption it wasn't
[1:09:14] ready for a Rapture there was little
[1:09:16] things left off there things about
[1:09:18] sanctification things about Mysteries
[1:09:20] that were left off Wesley comes along he
[1:09:22] preaches sanctification and
[1:09:24] sanctification is good we believe in
[1:09:26] sanctification we believe in living holy
[1:09:28] amen but yet there was things there that
[1:09:30] were left off it wasn't ready yet but
[1:09:32] when this message come not just a
[1:09:34] Reformation the original abstract word
[1:09:37] what did Malachi do He
[1:09:40] restored that means it's restored
[1:09:42] completely amen it restored the word
[1:09:45] amen not just a faith the faith the
[1:09:50] abstract the word that was once
[1:09:53] delivered to the Saints it's in
[1:09:55] possession today amen there's nothing
[1:09:58] there amen there's nothing in your
[1:10:01] life now it depends on what kind of an
[1:10:04] order do you ask see this is why your
[1:10:06] confession is important well I've made
[1:10:07] this mistake and I failed here and I
[1:10:09] listen if you let Satan order your
[1:10:11] property he'll find all kinds of things
[1:10:13] well listen you're not good enough
[1:10:15] you're not smart enough you can't go in
[1:10:17] the Rapture you come from this family
[1:10:18] you've got this situation but when you
[1:10:20] look at the abstract none of that's
[1:10:22] there amen cuz the abstract was wrot
[1:10:25] before any of that was ever
[1:10:27] done God never put that in the original
[1:10:31] God never put that in the abstract amen
[1:10:33] so your confession is going to determine
[1:10:36] where you live you can live on borrowed
[1:10:39] property or you can live free it's all
[1:10:42] going to depend on what you speak over
[1:10:44] your situation it's all going to depend
[1:10:47] on what your confession is amen you can
[1:10:49] take the words of a Shyer and a squatter
[1:10:52] or you can say I've got the abstract and
[1:10:54] his spirit
[1:10:55] hallelujah it's Bor witness with my
[1:10:58] spirit that I am an overcomer that I am
[1:11:01] more than a conqueror that I can do all
[1:11:03] things through Christ who loves me
[1:11:05] through Christ who strengthens me it's
[1:11:08] not you today it's him today we
[1:11:11] preaching Christ it's Christ in you he's
[1:11:14] the hope of
[1:11:15] glory you didn't start this and you're
[1:11:18] not going to end it but he's going to
[1:11:20] settle it for some of us he's going to
[1:11:22] settle it right here today things you've
[1:11:24] dealt with things you've lived with for
[1:11:26] years he's ready to set her up
[1:11:29] amise the Lord
[1:11:35] hallelujah in this age Christ has struck
[1:11:37] off every claim can I say this say it
[1:11:39] this way every excuse of the enemy for
[1:11:43] why you can't overcome listen they can't
[1:11:46] be a Son of God because of this they
[1:11:48] can't every excuse that he's fabricated
[1:11:50] or invented it's
[1:11:52] nullified in this hour there's nothing
[1:11:56] left amen that's why this bride she is
[1:11:59] predestinated not to fall because the
[1:12:02] one that had the original abstract has
[1:12:04] presented it to the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:06] Christ through the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:12:09] and we are looking at it it's no longer
[1:12:11] glass Darkly it's no longer a closed
[1:12:13] book we're looking at it face to face
[1:12:15] we're seeing what it says and we
[1:12:17] recognize there's not one spot amen
[1:12:20] there's not one blemish because he's the
[1:12:23] one that said I will have a church with
[1:12:26] no spot no blemish or any such
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:12:33] thing so to have this Redemption to have
[1:12:35] this purchasing there must be an
[1:12:38] unsealing of an evidence that was
[1:12:41] formerly
[1:12:42] sealed amen that is so good John says
[1:12:45] this in first John he says if we receive
[1:12:46] the witness of men the witness of God is
[1:12:49] greater if you take nothing else home
[1:12:51] today I hope you remember no matter what
[1:12:54] witness you've heard the witness of God
[1:12:56] is
[1:12:57] greater there's no one to overrule the
[1:12:59] witness of God when you have the
[1:13:01] abstract there's no other document well
[1:13:03] I've got this document you know how
[1:13:04] lawyers are they come up and they've got
[1:13:06] 400 pages and they throw it up there
[1:13:08] like you got to read through this and
[1:13:10] you got to this and get a lawyer listen
[1:13:12] I got the abstract I don't care what
[1:13:14] this says it's in my
[1:13:18] hand it doesn't matter what mommy and
[1:13:20] daddy say it doesn't matter what the
[1:13:22] church says what God has said amen if we
[1:13:25] receive the W it doesn't matter what you
[1:13:26] think about
[1:13:28] it listen you're your own biggest enemy
[1:13:32] that's right and many times you're the
[1:13:33] one holding you back God is not here
[1:13:36] today to hold us
[1:13:37] back God is not here today to put us in
[1:13:40] bondage the thief comes to steal and to
[1:13:43] kill and destroy said I've come right
[1:13:46] amen that you might have life it
[1:13:49] abundantly
[1:13:51] amen the witness of God is greater for
[1:13:54] this is the witness of God
[1:13:55] which is testified of his son he that
[1:13:57] believeth on the Son of God hath the
[1:13:59] witness can I say this way has the
[1:14:01] evidence in himself he has the witness
[1:14:04] in himself he that believes not God hath
[1:14:06] made him a liar because he believed not
[1:14:08] the record that God gave of his son and
[1:14:12] this is the record that God has given us
[1:14:13] eternal life and this life is in his
[1:14:18] son
[1:14:20] amen now if you just leave that all back
[1:14:23] there say well that was good back there
[1:14:25] that's listen the enemy can do that well
[1:14:27] yeah we used to have an abstract in the
[1:14:28] church we used to have an absolute but
[1:14:31] listen we're in a modern era we've got
[1:14:33] new things we've got new challenges and
[1:14:35] new situations and it's the same devil
[1:14:39] and it's the same God and the same devil
[1:14:42] that was defeated back there he's
[1:14:43] defeated today and the same God that was
[1:14:46] Victorious back there he's Victorious
[1:14:48] today listen he didn't just defeat the
[1:14:51] Devil he spoiled him he made us show
[1:14:54] them openly he gloated over him he
[1:14:57] showboated over him he marched him
[1:14:59] through the streets naked showing the
[1:15:01] devil has no power over the believer
[1:15:05] other than what you give him
[1:15:07] right that's good other than what you
[1:15:11] give him you can speak his language and
[1:15:14] you can live in that place or you can
[1:15:16] speak what the word says and you can
[1:15:18] live far above every principality every
[1:15:22] Power but I'm going through things I'm
[1:15:24] dealing with things that's not the point
[1:15:26] the point is the abstract says it's
[1:15:30] defeated if it takes 5 minutes or 500
[1:15:33] years he's still defeated
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:38] today see the nominal Church they
[1:15:40] believe that Jesus Christ died and rose
[1:15:42] again
[1:15:43] amen but that's not the same as having
[1:15:45] the abstract in
[1:15:47] you amen a historical document is not
[1:15:51] what the Bible is talking about we have
[1:15:53] a living w we Are Witnesses with it
[1:15:55] amen the Bible says beloved believe not
[1:15:57] every Spirit but try the spirits whether
[1:15:59] they are of God because many false
[1:16:01] prophets are going out into the world
[1:16:02] hereby know you the spirit of God every
[1:16:04] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[1:16:06] is come right not just did come is come
[1:16:10] in the flesh is of God Amen every spirit
[1:16:15] that confesses not that Jesus Christ is
[1:16:16] come in the flesh is not of God and this
[1:16:18] is that Spirit of antichrist amen so if
[1:16:21] the enemy has you believe that this The
[1:16:22] Life of Christ the record of eternal
[1:16:24] life life which is the evidence of your
[1:16:27] Redemption if he just puts that in an
[1:16:29] earn vessel back there somewhere and you
[1:16:31] leave it in the ground you can't
[1:16:34] purchase Redemption with that amen you
[1:16:36] don't actually have a claim till you go
[1:16:39] get it and get it up to date amen till
[1:16:42] you have it in your possession so a lot
[1:16:44] of people that it's like we just
[1:16:45] celebrated Easter a lot of people
[1:16:47] believe you can go to the tomb where
[1:16:48] Jesus is that well listen he's not using
[1:16:50] it today right it's no longer in use
[1:16:54] it's vacant right I don't suggest you
[1:16:56] pick it up amen he's not there amen it's
[1:17:00] not there today praise the Lord but the
[1:17:03] treasure is in Earth and vessels today
[1:17:06] the same treasure that was in an earth
[1:17:08] and vessel back there it died and rose
[1:17:10] again it proved it was Messiah it proved
[1:17:13] it was the Savior it proved it was the
[1:17:15] Christ and it ascended into Heavenly
[1:17:17] places but the life that was in that
[1:17:19] Earth and vessel came back on the day of
[1:17:22] Pentecost as cling tongues of fire and
[1:17:24] it sat over the people and it testified
[1:17:27] that even the even the enemies of God
[1:17:29] could look at these disciples and they
[1:17:30] could perceive they've been with Jesus
[1:17:33] there's something different about them
[1:17:35] it's little Messiah at running around
[1:17:37] the world today having the same life the
[1:17:39] same power the same Authority preaching
[1:17:42] the same
[1:17:45] word now we have this treasure Paul
[1:17:48] speaking afterwards there in the book of
[1:17:50] second Corinthians we have this treasure
[1:17:53] and Earth in right
[1:17:56] vessels brother B says when Jeremiah
[1:17:58] wrote this book it was sealed he say
[1:17:59] here's a good thing I want you to notice
[1:18:01] all you that read it then that sealed
[1:18:03] book he say now remember it was going to
[1:18:04] be gone he had prophesied now he didn't
[1:18:07] know only through prophecy he says are
[1:18:09] you following me through prophecy he
[1:18:12] knew through the revelation of God that
[1:18:14] they was going to be away from that
[1:18:15] country for 70 years you remember him
[1:18:18] prophesying that he would be 70 years
[1:18:21] they'd be in captivity so he wanted to
[1:18:23] be sure I like that I want to make sure
[1:18:27] I ain't got no trouble when I get back I
[1:18:29] don't want no trouble at the river I
[1:18:30] don't want no trouble for my kids amen
[1:18:32] he wanted to be sure that this seal that
[1:18:36] his inheritance would be kept because he
[1:18:38] inherited his cousin's inheritance so he
[1:18:40] had it all wrote up legally and what did
[1:18:43] he do with it so it wouldn't rot or rust
[1:18:45] he put it in an Earthly vessel right and
[1:18:49] put it away so it won't rot or rust
[1:18:51] until them 70 years was expired he says
[1:18:53] glory to God I hope you would catch it
[1:18:57] did you see what God did he never
[1:18:59] revealed it to the high's and prudent so
[1:19:01] they could fuss about it all the time he
[1:19:03] put it in an Earthly vessel created
[1:19:06] himself his own son Christ Jesus you say
[1:19:08] well that's good and he says and in this
[1:19:11] last day now amen I want you to bring
[1:19:14] this up to speed here you are in this
[1:19:17] last day now he's opening the seals and
[1:19:20] showing it to his church kept it in an
[1:19:22] Earthly vessel so it w r or r he says
[1:19:25] hallelujah I know you think I'm a Holy
[1:19:27] Roller maybe I am you see but there it
[1:19:30] is it's been kept wrapped up in the
[1:19:32] vessel of the earth that was redeemed
[1:19:34] out of the Earth come up on Easter
[1:19:36] morning where death's seals couldn't
[1:19:39] hold him any longer but he broke the
[1:19:41] seals and arose up and proved himself in
[1:19:44] this last days he is alive he is in his
[1:19:48] church he is the same yesterday today
[1:19:52] and forever
[1:19:55] Hallelujah pise the Lord now this is the
[1:19:57] part where I you know I study this and I
[1:19:59] think about it you know I'm not maybe
[1:20:03] the smartest person in the world but you
[1:20:06] know if you uh if you give me an
[1:20:08] abstract title said you'll inherit the
[1:20:10] whole
[1:20:11] earth I would probably put it somewhere
[1:20:17] else amen you said this entitles you to
[1:20:20] everything I would probably get a lawyer
[1:20:22] and I'd probably hire some guards I get
[1:20:24] a big old Vault a big old Vault and I
[1:20:27] put this combination lock on this retina
[1:20:29] scanner and some robots and some guard
[1:20:31] dogs and I dig a mo around this thing I
[1:20:34] put some alligators in there and some
[1:20:36] sharks and I have some fighter jets
[1:20:38] flying overhead and they're just ready
[1:20:39] to you come within 100 fet Bo boom you
[1:20:41] know like I would
[1:20:43] really really I mean this is not you're
[1:20:46] getting your your dad's bottle cap
[1:20:48] collection and man this is like a big
[1:20:51] deal I would put it somewhere really
[1:20:53] safe you know what God said I'm going to
[1:20:55] put it in a
[1:20:57] pot I'm going to STI in a clay pot like
[1:20:59] you get at the Pottery
[1:21:01] Barn and I'm just like hold up here you
[1:21:05] know I don't I I would never question
[1:21:07] the wisdom of God but you know I put in
[1:21:09] a fortress or a bank or a strong box but
[1:21:11] God said I'll hide it in you right and
[1:21:14] you're sitting here today and God says
[1:21:16] yeah I'm going to stick in you it's safe
[1:21:18] there how is it safe there man I'm not
[1:21:21] even safe for me I stum my toe I tell
[1:21:24] you what praise
[1:21:25] Lord I don't know why I'm doing this but
[1:21:27] here we are you know I had I had two STS
[1:21:29] put in here a few years ago and so I I'm
[1:21:31] on these blood thinners and you know I
[1:21:33] decided one day to play with a knife
[1:21:35] with a 6in blade I'm just sitting there
[1:21:38] my parents and I drop it on my leg and I
[1:21:39] thought well that's
[1:21:41] curious that's very interesting it began
[1:21:43] to bleed I thought well I'll put a
[1:21:45] Band-Aid on it well you know what it
[1:21:46] continued to bleed six it didn't go in
[1:21:48] six Ines but I mean you know so I
[1:21:50] continued to bleed and 3:00 in the
[1:21:52] morning I finally decided
[1:21:55] hey maybe I should go to the
[1:21:58] hospital and they had to glue it up and
[1:22:00] everything else doesn't seem very safe
[1:22:03] when this guy's handling it the vessel
[1:22:05] doesn't seem like it's a very good place
[1:22:07] to put the treasures of everything
[1:22:11] doesn't seem like a great idea does it
[1:22:13] but God said no that's where I want it
[1:22:14] it's very safe there and I got to be
[1:22:16] thinking about you know I've I've I've
[1:22:17] gone different places in the world and
[1:22:19] you know you're walking along the
[1:22:21] streets you can go to you can go to
[1:22:22] Africa you can go to India you can go to
[1:22:24] downtown Sheffield amen you can go to
[1:22:26] Chicago or whatever and you can walk
[1:22:28] down the street you can walk down the
[1:22:29] dirt and listen the dirt on the north
[1:22:32] side of town it's the same dirt on the
[1:22:34] south side of town but some of it's not
[1:22:36] as safe as the others it has nothing to
[1:22:38] do with the Earth itself it's the
[1:22:40] situation around it
[1:22:42] amen I you know it's like a back here a
[1:22:45] few years here we are you know back here
[1:22:47] a few years ago they they Declassified
[1:22:49] all this stuff about Area 51 I don't
[1:22:51] know how many conspiracy theorists we
[1:22:53] got here but you know some people think
[1:22:54] there's like aliens and extraterrestrial
[1:22:56] they they Declassified all this stuff
[1:22:58] about Area 51 and some of these keyboard
[1:23:01] Warriors they got this idea said we're
[1:23:03] going to go there we're going to walk in
[1:23:06] we're going to see what's there good
[1:23:09] luck and so they're all like they got
[1:23:12] this big petition they get on the
[1:23:13] whatever they got on and they're all
[1:23:15] like listen we're all going to show up
[1:23:16] on a certain day I guess it was too
[1:23:17] early in the morning for most of them
[1:23:18] but we're going to show up on a certain
[1:23:20] day and we're going to get together and
[1:23:22] there's going to be 50,000 of us and
[1:23:23] they can't stop us
[1:23:25] all I'm thinking listen I don't know
[1:23:28] what you think you're going to do with
[1:23:30] your keyboard and your soy latte and
[1:23:32] your man bun but you ain't making it
[1:23:35] in I don't care if there's 100,000 of
[1:23:37] you they've got guns that fire tens of
[1:23:40] thousands of rounds a minute they'll
[1:23:42] shoot you from a mile away you lived in
[1:23:44] your parents basement till you were 45
[1:23:46] you ain't breaking it
[1:23:49] anywhere now listen this base it's in
[1:23:52] the middle Nevada no one wants to live
[1:23:54] this it's the desert it's like the Deep
[1:23:57] desert there's nothing there nobody
[1:23:59] wants to live there and you can walk in
[1:24:01] the Nevada desert and go knock yourself
[1:24:04] out and listen it's just dirt it's it's
[1:24:07] not even desirable dirt nobody wants to
[1:24:10] be there but as soon as you go to that
[1:24:12] fence you're a dead
[1:24:14] man the dirt on that side of the fence
[1:24:17] is the same dirt as that side the fence
[1:24:19] the difference is who ownes
[1:24:21] it this dirt this Earth it's just like
[1:24:25] every Your Vessel it's just like
[1:24:27] everybody else's your flesh is not
[1:24:29] special your upbringing is not special
[1:24:31] your Earthly vessel is not special
[1:24:33] you're know better than anybody else the
[1:24:35] difference is you cross this line you
[1:24:38] cross this bloodline somebody's
[1:24:40] protecting that
[1:24:42] property there's something different
[1:24:44] about you than the president of the
[1:24:45] United States there's something
[1:24:47] different about you than the prime
[1:24:48] minister of Russia amen Your Vessel is
[1:24:51] owned by God almighty
[1:24:56] and you might not have a bunch of fire
[1:24:57] jets and you might not have a million
[1:24:59] man army but you've got the angel of the
[1:25:02] Lord the angel of the Lord encampeth
[1:25:04] round about them that fear Him and
[1:25:07] delivers
[1:25:08] them one angel of God can wipe out an
[1:25:13] army listen Your Vessel is feeble Your
[1:25:17] Vessel is inadequate but the one that
[1:25:19] owns it says not one step further
[1:25:24] listen Satan had ackn knowledge when he
[1:25:27] went to temp job I can't even touch him
[1:25:29] you won't let
[1:25:31] me and God said you know what I'll give
[1:25:34] you permission don't going to touch his
[1:25:36] flesh I'll give you permission but you
[1:25:38] can't take his life how that must have
[1:25:39] burned the devil just let me kill my at
[1:25:43] no you can only go as far as I say and
[1:25:45] no further and no matter where you're at
[1:25:47] today or what you're going through your
[1:25:50] vessel is God's personal
[1:25:53] property he owns it he protects it he
[1:25:56] Hedges it he's built on promises he's
[1:25:59] secured it by his angels he's filled it
[1:26:01] with his
[1:26:03] spirit and Satan can't do one thing to
[1:26:06] you before the enemy can even come
[1:26:08] against you he has to go and get
[1:26:10] permission from
[1:26:11] God and God has already spoken you shall
[1:26:14] not die you shall live to declare the
[1:26:17] works of the Lord you are not the tail
[1:26:20] you are the head
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:28] praise the Lord your dirt's special cuz
[1:26:31] who owns it not because you made it
[1:26:33] special
[1:26:37] Amen brother B talks about it we we we
[1:26:40] see it in the message in in the
[1:26:42] scripture you know people they could go
[1:26:46] into slavery they could sell themselves
[1:26:49] in the Old Testament under a bondage
[1:26:51] under slavery they had no rights
[1:26:54] but every
[1:26:56] Jubilee when that trumpet sounded the
[1:26:59] amount of debt you were in didn't matter
[1:27:02] if you'd been in a slave for 49 years or
[1:27:05] 49 seconds it didn't matter when that
[1:27:09] trumpet sounds you're free to go back to
[1:27:12] your listen he's not just sitting you
[1:27:14] free and you wall around what am I going
[1:27:15] to do you're free to go back to your
[1:27:17] inheritance you could not lose your
[1:27:20] inheritance as a Hebrew it was always
[1:27:23] secure
[1:27:24] that's why Jeremiah's cousin he couldn't
[1:27:26] he couldn't sell up to the trumps or the
[1:27:28] bidens or whatever it had to stay in the
[1:27:31] family and the promises of God are made
[1:27:33] to stay in the family amen God has
[1:27:36] spoken things for his family we're his
[1:27:38] inheritance amen we're his offspring
[1:27:44] amen praise the Lord now you can stay
[1:27:48] bound if you like the slave life but as
[1:27:52] for me it's like I was talking about
[1:27:53] Patrick Henry Give me liberty or give me
[1:27:56] death I'd rather die a Freeman than live
[1:27:58] a slave right I don't know if that's the
[1:28:00] American imy or what amen listen we were
[1:28:03] born to be
[1:28:06] free we were born to be that way and
[1:28:09] we've heard the Jubilee at the end of
[1:28:11] seven Church ages at the end of seven
[1:28:13] messages we've heard a trumpet sound
[1:28:15] amen it's declared war it's a scriptural
[1:28:18] sound it's declared war on the enemy but
[1:28:20] it's also declared Liberty to the
[1:28:22] captives it's declared the the
[1:28:24] acceptable year of Lord It's declare the
[1:28:26] day of Vengeance this is the end of all
[1:28:30] things this is the time for it amen
[1:28:32] we've heard our Jubilee and we can go
[1:28:35] free amen
[1:28:39] hallelujah this message has your Liberty
[1:28:41] in it amen amen because it's the
[1:28:43] interpretation of this word listen I
[1:28:45] don't I'm not against reading other
[1:28:47] things or this that but listen what you
[1:28:48] need for your Earthly Journey where's it
[1:28:50] it's in you how do you get there you
[1:28:53] heard the word you believe the word
[1:28:54] you've got what you need you don't have
[1:28:55] to go look for something else amen when
[1:28:58] when Ruth takes Naomi back to her
[1:29:00] inheritance back to the land she came

[1:29:59] amen you know I I told testimony years
[1:30:01] ago I don't know if I've told it here
[1:30:02] but I I told this this is years ago my
[1:30:05] first mission trip I ever went to I was
[1:30:06] in Uganda and we had meetings and we'd
[1:30:08] seen the Lord move and do certain things
[1:30:11] and there was a there was a gentleman
[1:30:13] there he'd been a Pentecostal Bishop had
[1:30:15] a church of 900 people and he heard the
[1:30:18] message and he believed the message and
[1:30:20] he left that church he left a lot of
[1:30:22] money left a nice Church Church lost 2/3
[1:30:25] of his church he went from 900 to 300
[1:30:27] which is still a lot but I mean he had
[1:30:30] 900 people loses 600 people and we go
[1:30:34] and we have church from him in a brush
[1:30:36] Arbor brother talks about brush Arbor
[1:30:37] we've got like six wooden poles and a
[1:30:40] bunch of brush and that's what it was
[1:30:42] amen listen this is out in the middle of
[1:30:44] the Jungle there's there's no
[1:30:46] electricity out there they had a
[1:30:47] generator there and they had the
[1:30:49] microphone two speakers and one light
[1:30:52] bulb wow I hope you don't take this the
[1:30:54] wrong way but it was night time in
[1:30:56] Africa and people are sitting there I
[1:30:58] couldn't even see the people preaching
[1:31:00] like it was that dark amen couldn't see
[1:31:02] a thing so I'm preaching these people
[1:31:04] and there's a woman near the front she's
[1:31:06] been she's laying on so you have to know
[1:31:07] how Africa is I mean if they say they
[1:31:09] start church at 3: it means 6
[1:31:11] o00 right like they never start anything
[1:31:14] on time at least not where I was at so
[1:31:17] um so there's like people laying down
[1:31:19] sleeping I'm thinking well they probably
[1:31:20] been there all day there's this woman
[1:31:21] she's laying there I get done preaching
[1:31:25] and she's laying there and the The
[1:31:28] Interpreter comes up says we want you to
[1:31:29] pray for the sick I said okay and uh and
[1:31:32] to make my point this this bishop he'
[1:31:35] come out of Pentecost some of his
[1:31:37] associates they come they wanted to see
[1:31:38] what was going on they actually come to
[1:31:40] make fun of him like oh yeah we heard
[1:31:41] about he lost his church and all stuff
[1:31:42] so they're sitting in the meeting they
[1:31:43] heard the message preach they just kind
[1:31:45] of they're looking at each other kind of
[1:31:46] laughing the whole time and stuff well
[1:31:48] we go to pray for this woman she's
[1:31:49] laying there and I'm like what's wrong
[1:31:50] with her and The Interpreter says she's
[1:31:52] paralyzed one side of her body I said
[1:31:55] really I said so we we prayed for her I
[1:31:58] looked at him said tell her to stand up
[1:31:59] in the name of Jesus Christ he kind of
[1:32:01] looked at me f said tell her to stand up
[1:32:03] in the name of Jesus Christ so I took
[1:32:05] one hand and he took the other and she
[1:32:06] stood up and she began to walk through
[1:32:08] the
[1:32:09] meeting and so of course all the other
[1:32:11] sick people like hey I you know the
[1:32:13] water was stirring and so like there's
[1:32:15] there's a guy come up there he's
[1:32:16] blinding one eye and I'm praying for him
[1:32:18] I hadn't even finished praying for him
[1:32:19] and God opens his eyes I can see the
[1:32:22] trees out in the jungle in the night I'm
[1:32:23] thinking I can't see the trees in the
[1:32:25] jungle at night and and God begins to do
[1:32:27] one miracle and God does another miracle
[1:32:29] and these guys all of a sudden they're
[1:32:31] interested in the service they're
[1:32:32] interested in what's going on this and
[1:32:34] they they want to taught me afterwards
[1:32:35] and said well you know what's the secret
[1:32:37] of this and this and that I said listen
[1:32:38] if you preach this message that's what
[1:32:41] I'm coming to you today if you preach
[1:32:42] this message that your brother preaches
[1:32:45] if you'll take it the way God said it
[1:32:46] and you'll preach it in the spirit that
[1:32:47] God gave it and you preach it with the
[1:32:49] power that God preached it with and then
[1:32:50] he delivered it through a prophet it
[1:32:52] will do the same thing for anyone amen
[1:32:54] it's not a respector of persons it's not
[1:32:57] a onean show if you'll take the word
