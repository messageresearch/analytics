you would forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings Lord may your presence just have the complete right away this morning in Jesus name amen amen God bless you thank you musician song leader um I want to go to Ruth chapter 2 uh once again and um as you're turning there in Ruth chapter 2 I I I want to continue to speak on this thought on the value of obedience and throughout this book of Ruth as we look at it you know when the reality if when you read the the Bible if you if you don't see Jesus Christ in every verse then you need to go back and read it again and when you look in the Book of Ruth very small book but it's a book that actually it speaks of so beautifully of the redeeming work of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not a doesn't have a lot of chapters in it but it has the significance of what Christ himself God becoming one of us in order to fully redeem us and when we look in upon this thought that ask the Lord would just grace us this morning once again on that value of obedience I believe I believe I'm a witness and I believe you could testify there is Great Value in obedience to the things of God there is Great Value in Ruth chapter 2 and verse one and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of IMC and his name was Boaz I want you to notice how that chapter opens this is the focus then verse two the Moab then Ruth the moabit said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him and whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz who was of the Kindred of ELC Lord now as Believers we don't believe that anything's by chance the Bible says that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord Jacob came to bethl and he didn't see any significance to it but God had a significance and God met Jacob there at bethl and what just became a a stopping place to get some rest it became a place for God to make himself known to Jacob so there's we're we're not here by chance it's it's by Design even as we're gathered here this morning were here by the design of almighty God verse four and Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the Reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was set over the Reapers answered and said it is the moabi is damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the sheath so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she carried a little in the house then said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have not I charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art of thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated you you can look in your even in your Bible and look at the headings above every chapter there in the Book of Ruth four chapters and you can see that there are four parts the prophet would lay that out over and over again and showing us those four stages where of the decision that Ruth had made and then she comes into the land and begins to labor then it moves into chapter three you can see there where it's to enter into rest and then there is the full reward that would come with it and we recognize that in the time in the hour that we are living in and that we we recognize that we are we're not just in a place of deciding although everyone has to make a decision we're not just in a time of of laboring although we do have to labor the Bible says to enter into his rest there has to be a desire that we are just yielding to his leading remember the prophet tells us that when you have need of healing he said if you'll just let the Holy Spirit he will take you to your healing he said you need the Holy Ghost he said let him take you to the Holy Spirit see God knows the way we you and I don't know the way but it's the whole the whole part of it if there's one word that we can even say once again to put before us it's yielding to his voice it's yielding to him it's Allowing God to have the right away and that and that's part of obedience and I want you to notice that as we look at this here that Ruth she starts out and she's you know she's come over into to make her decision and she's now entered into the fields and she enters into these fields and she begins to glean because there's a need for food but there is fruit the the Bible tells us that they returned because they heard that there was bread in the land of Israel it was the time of The Barley Harvest and to understand that time of The Barley Harvest that is a type of that of Pentecost it's a type of the grain that went in the ground and is raised up again it's come to maturity and now that grain is to give life and to see that how that you and I by the grace of God not because of any of our merits we as Gentiles Paul goes through this all the way through the book of Romans that if it had not been for the blinding of the Jews and that's only for a period of time God had already in his mind to take a a people among the Gentiles for his name's sake like Joseph going down into Egypt this mystery remember Paul would write of it through the book of Ephesians he would write of it in Colossians and how that God had given him that mystery and that mystery was of how that God was going to bring in Gentile bride that part that was hidden yet there were scriptures that was laid all the way through the Old Testament of how that God would speak of this through the book of Isaiah and Hosea habac on and on these these promises laid there in the scriptures and let me just say this if there's a promise that God has made he made it with someone in mind and he knew that there would be somebody that that promise when his presence would go over that that promise would stand hand out to them and they would reach down and they would take that promise into themselves now when we think of this of gleaning and and coming into the field here she is she's gleaning for food and you know she's gleaning in the promises of which uh we can say it in this way that the the the Jewish church when they the Jews when they themselves when they were blinded and we recognize that there were promises that were left in that of redemption and God now opening and bringing in the Gentiles remember Paul when he was uh a commissioned and called by God that God said I had chosen thee to be a vessel and to Bear my name before the Gentiles to to turn them away from darkness and unto the light so God would use a vessel here Paul would would stand there and begin to rehearse the promises of God remember as Gentiles we were not even included uh as far as written out in that of the adoption and everything that was written in the the promises that pertain to to to to Redemption and and that of a redeemer but you know listen as far as among the Jews they were uh looking for this there they they were they knew these words they knew these promises but yet in reality there were only a handful that was actually looking looking for them in the right way when the Lord Jesus came his church was about eight people you had Simeon in the temple you had you had uh H Anna the blind prophetess just a few because the religious of that day who knew the promises yet when he stood there they called him [Applause] beela they didn't want anything to do with him and to know that here then how we enter in and this is what I want to come into this morning as as Ruth begins to enter in she's following under her decision and she's laboring and she's made a decision to go with Naomi just like a life can make a decision to begin to serve the Lord and listen if God doesn't deal with your heart then you know there's nothing that we can do uh you know God's not let me just tell you like this God is not in the business of making any afraid to where you you you walk around and you're afraid of him that that's not the fear of the Lord uh that's not the objective but God's desire is that you would come to trust him that you would love him he he wants to make himself known to you all along the way so you can have confidence in every promise not only that you are standing in but he will build your faith for the promise that you are to lay hold upon on next she was gleaning promises maybe in this field she was gleaning Promises at this time when she came in there was Promises of healing there was Promises of Grace there was Promises of Deliverance now listen there are many that can glean in the field for healing for grace and for deliverance and never come to glean the promises of redemption that's right when I'm talking about the promises of redemption I'm talking about where it becomes that we become United with him our Kinsman and to recognize something deeper than just the field we're in but to recognize whose field it is and to recognize what he is able to do for me and move in my life that will give me a Grace that'll move from just me laboring and trying to work everything out to I can come to a place of rest so we want to see that this chapter opens with the announcement it opens with the announcement of she has a a Kinsman that is a mighty man of wealth which that word means of Valor he's a mighty man of Valor he's a near Kinsman and as he as this is made known notice that's becomes the focus you know when God wants anything to uh to be known for us and what he wants our attention to be on God's very clear about it God will set the direction of what he wants us to be focused on you know this is why you can't run a race if you're looking here if you're looking there or you're looking behind you you've got the Bible says looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith yes sir because there's a lot of distractions that can try to take our eyes and our attention away and let me just tell you it only takes one moment of distraction and the enemy will use any tactic you can't listen he knows how we're made up he knows the things and listen I I'm talking even deeper than when it comes to that of even just sin he knows of certain things of how that we're made up of things that can even pull on our heart strings but let me tell you it ought to be such a resolve within your heart that I'm going to serve God I'm going to esteem like job said esteem his word above my necessary food that's right I want to serve God I I don't want to just know parts and bits and but I want to I want to have an assurance and everything that I'm doing I I want his word to be fully preeminent in my life and my heart I want it to rain supremely in my life now let me just I I read a little bit of this last week and I want to just start in here where the Prophet picks this up and he'll he'll refer to this in many places in the message in regards to this what n what what um uh that Boaz has said to Ruth about abiding here in this field by my maidens and let your eyes be on the field and reap after them and there's refreshment for you when you get weary there's refreshment amen yes that's good let me just say this to you there there is refreshment in the house of God Amen there is refreshment that's already been provided for you and I amen when you feel like you're getting weary it's a time of refreshment it's a moment oh God I need refreshment but listen don't wait till you get parched don't wait till you're almost completely dehydrated stay let me just tell you the words of the Prophet strive to live continually in the life of God strive to stay in the spirit of Revival that's overcoming life now brother B says it like this he said he went over there to her and he said now look don't leave this field out of redeeming Redemption he said don't you leave this field that's the way it is stay put look stay where you are every man that's born of the spirit of God when he's set in Christ his eyes is on Calvary right in the middle of the road if he's just now watch how he goes now if he's just a little bit emotional first thing you know he'll work out here to over this side he'll become a fanatic if he don't watch if he's just a little starchy educated he'll work over on this side becoming cold stiff starchy and take all the spirit out of him if the devil can't keep you from seeing the truth he'll push you off of the deep end with it yeah amen how many know in the scripture Isaiah 35 said that there is a way or a highway and in the middle of that Highway there's a way if we're not walking the Highway of Holiness that ain't the word the word said there's a highway and there would be a way in the middle of that Highway any good road the middle of that road is what's raised up true a road does not cave in like this you know I'm talking about I'm talking about a road out here that road is made so that the water will wash off of the road it'll go to this ditch or it'll go to that ditch and this is why it's important of staying in the middle in the center of the road and let me say this to you there's a lot of truth but remember he is the truth he must be the absolute of your life it must become to to where he's the focus not anybody else not anybody else's feelings not anybody let me just tell you something I don't even care how long the longest time that you've got somebody that you know that's serving God your eyes should never be upon somebody else that's good because you get the following somebody else that can lead you right away you keep your eyes on Christ am I don't care if it's father mother grandmother grandfather you keep your eyes on Christ remember if you respect man above God God will hold you accountable but the Bible said let every man's word action deed be a lie and let God's word be the truth are you hearing me I believe there ought to be examples right examples in the house of God I believe that everybody that attends here and you call this your home church we ought to live like it not just in the house of God we ought to live like it outside come on now we're not here just to show up we're here that God would mold and shape and make and mold Our Lives to be real images of Christ I want you to notice what what the prophet's just saying right here and he'll say it over and over you realize this if the man's a little bit emotional or he'll say if he's a little bit starchy you know what that is it's still a lot of self and let me just tell you something we can have listen to me now we can have our own preferences about things but you nor me has the right or we we could have a right but you don't want me preaching my opinions right that's right you don't want me preaching my opinions you might have your thoughts I might have my thoughts but that's not what we're to preach we are to preach the word of God the message of the hour amen right amen amen and that's why when someone says well I think I think this well okay let's look at it in the word of God Amen let's look at it well I heard no I'm not interested in so and so I'm asking you do you got a quote for me that's right amen do you got a scripture I don't want somebody else's idea listen if God seeing it's so important for you and I he has not left us Here Helpless without one thing lacking God has supplied it all that we have need of who am I talking about I'm talking about our Kinsmen God has not delivered us a word that would leave us up and down and in and out and sin and and lives filled and bound that's not how God has left us God has left us with a sure word am my my my notice he says stay put he talked about how the Pentecostals got off go to the next paragraph it says Don't Run Away way stay in Christ don't go after gifts and everything stay with a giver God will take care of the gifts stay there yes stay in the field oh I need to go talk to this brother I need to see if God's got a word from me let me tell you something God sent a prophet already Hallelujah are you hearing me God's already sent his word and that when God came and he moved through the ministry of Malachi 4 it was to bring the reality to you and I that what we have need of is the word of God and God himself is standing here with a full absolute Hallelujah you say why because people will start running after this and running after this and I got to have this man to pray for me and this man's got to say a word over me this let me tell you something there's one gift to a [Applause] generation come on friends every one of those nine spiritual gifts us to be judged are you hearing me that's the word of God no dream should be spoken unless it's been judged Hallelujah that's God's word hallelujah I don't care who it is it's got to come in line with God's word and if there's anything that says well that's too tight the prophet said what about me when I stand on the platform and have to give thus sayith the Lord afterwards brother Samuel you what are you saying I'm saying keep your eyes on Christ right that's what Boaz has was reminding her stay put don't be pulled here pulled here and sometimes those things are are in a way people have good intentions people can have they have good intentions of wanting to see a move of God but listen you don't have to create a move of God are you hearing me a move of God is not something that's created we got to travel to some locality here and no no the the move that God has is is a move inside of your life stay in the field just look at it stay in the field stay there you know God will take care of it remember remember how many people would say when they'd come to the Lord and brother Bram should we start seeking gifts brother Ram said don't do that he said you end up a stuffed shirt he wasn't speaking against the gifts he's letting the people know don't go seeking for something just stay right in Christ love him I'm just going to tell you from my heart I didn't seek to be a minister of the Gospel I didn't want to be a minister of the Gospel Lord knows I sure didn't want to be a pastor I didn't ask for that but what I my heart's desire I was just happy serving God in the capacity that he called me if he had never asked me to preach the gospel I would have been just as happy but you see what whatever God has for you to do that's why it's to stay put in the field and God will bring everything out in its time we don't have to go seeking searching pressing reaching oh my notice he said stay here now until night till the sun's gone down and when Christ baptizes you with the Holy Spirit stay put right in Christ that first love is in your heart never let it get cold just keep loving him and move on now this principle of staying put it's always been in God's program God will give his word and it's a testing time it's whether or not that the people are going to be obedient to his word now in the beginning clear clear back in heaven remember when God created all the Angels Lucifer was part of that but remember he was an awful good guy in the beginning he was God's right-hand man that's the Book of Ezekiel is that right he was I mean he was he was right there tight with God as a matter of fact the scripture calls it in Ezekiel Thou Art the anointed chuban that coverthe was God's right-and man to Fellowship but Lucifer begin to desire something more than was present he wanted a more beautiful program he wanted something that he thought was better remember the Bible said thou was perfect until the day iniquity was found in thine heart what was iniquity to know what's right and not do it the greatest thing he could have done at that time was to abandon that but he couldn't stay put with the program and the Bible says he led Angels astray the Bible said there were Angels who kept not their first estate that's now let me just bring it down to what we call those angels demons they're Spirits right are you hearing me absolutely they fail they keep their same order and their hierarchy even in the fall we could read of that in the Book of Daniel but Lucifer led a rebellion because he wasn't content or to stay put in the garden when God gave his word to that of his children in the beginning here Satan makes his approach he takes a a a vessel that we know as the serpent which was the Beast it says the Beast more subtle than any beast of the field they wanting a snake crawling on the ground but to recognize that how he used this instrumentality and he comes to Eve and what's he trying to do he's trying to pull her away from the word let me tell you something if you can be talked into it you can be talked out of it if you can be shouted into it you can be shouted out of it it's got to be more than a shout it's got to be more than an emotion it's got to be Jesus J Christ well I don't shout like so and so maybe you're not a shouter but if you're not a shouter don't condemn somebody else who is just stay in the middle of the roadl and don't try to be a referee for everybody else come on Friends God's big enough to take care of his church he don't need a dozen Cooks in the kitchen and let me just tell you something I ain't the one who's the cook anyhow I just serve what he prepares is that all right now notice how that Eve herself she would told they were told just stay with the word God will bring it to pass in his season right how many times through the message now this may not have struck you but it strikes me when I to go all the way through the message there things that really perk up to me throughout even the message and I hear now one of the reason I believe even as a pastor is that God will alert me to these things where we're reminded over and over through the message that when the word has come be patient don't try when you see something needs to be done the prophet will say don't try to reach out in your senses and do it now that's not only as a pastor that can come to you as a father and a mother it can come to you as a another brother or sister that sometimes in the midst of a situation we see we can become frustrated and we're wanting to correct it right but it's through our own senses we must be patient the Bible said wait on the Lord and He Shall renew thy strength wait I say on the Lord and be of a good courage and he will strengthen thine heart we're never wrong for waiting but I want you to think of it in this way how that here she was pulled away from God's presence because of one word it just started with one word when Satan came to her and said yay hath God said right God had already revealed himself as Lord God now you might think well what's one word got to do with it let me tell you the Bible says clear at the end of the book whosoever adds one word is that right or taketh away his part will be removed from The Book of Life and what will be added to him is the plagues of this book so that's why it matters of who it is and whose field you're in are you hearing me it matters whose field that you're in Hallelujah the field that goes on with the world right now oh they love the gleanings of Grace but it ain't Grace it's disgrace it lets people live any way they want want now churches that were at one time I tell you John Wesley would rebuke every one of them Methodist Luther would disown them having homosexual people standing in the platform but you know what listen it didn't start that way it started by deviating from by one word sin doesn't all of a sudden it starts with one word amen hallelujah and sometimes then people are left to wonder how did it get this way one word one word one word one word not one be not a sentence one word that's why it's important man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god notice King in Genesis 4:16 he went out from the presence of the Lord right after here you have Abel and Cain that come forth both are coming to worship but Abel's coming by Revelation Cain is simply coming because he knows well it's time to worship I got to go worship and I'm going to I'm going to offer God all the best that I can do he's trying to work his way in to the economy of God but Abel who didn't ask but a who was of God he received a revelation from God and God spoke to Abel's heart and notice God come and confirmed what he spoke to Abel and when Cain saw it notice what God told Cain Cain knew what was right he saw what was right he saw the right field that's good but Cain stood right there in the presence of God and spit it right back in his face yes right and God told him if you worship like your brother if thou doest well shall won't thou also be accepted it didn't mean that Cain would have been anything different than what he was but if he would have just humbled himself to say I don't understand this but I know it's true I see what it's done for others I see it's changed this life I see it's changed this I know that no man can do these things but it was an Inc to Humble himself so the Bible said he went out from the presence of the Lord and He dwelt In the Land of wandering not I want you to listen what the prophet says right here in power of transformation he says Cain where he made his mistake first thing he did he made his mistake and there is where you will make a mistake and there is where I'll make the mistake the very minute we walk out of the presence of God go God's presence is his word being revealed God even think about it even how God will speak to your heart speak to my heart it matters in those moments what we do well Lord I've got a right and I've got this is the age of people's rights this the anointing upon this age we're going to be anointed one way or another I don't want to be Anointed with that I want to be Anointed with the spirit of God where I'm laying hold on my rights as a son of God has a daughter of God not I don't want I'm not interested in the rights out here because all those things that are out there it's Leading the People down this road to hell it's sad it's sad to see how that everything itself would move this is why the prophet would say it like this he would say you must always stay where the kingdom of God is and where the glory of God is pouring out stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night that's so you've got to stay there it's a battle notice notice the battle but God made provision he said I'll give you companions maidens I'll give you people that'll pray with you I give you people that'll encourage you along the way and I've spoken protection over your life the young men they might be able to chde you with their words but they can't touch you amen and I'll give you refreshment uhh that's great what more could you ask for through this journey he's provided what we need this is why even when the Lord Jesus John 665 here it was he said he said no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father and from that time notice John 666 from that time many of his disciples followers went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus well where did they go they didn't go back out to the bar right they went back to their churches they went back to the comfortable way because to walk with him was going to require a reproach it was going to require a change in their life amen come on friends just putting our name on a book don't require no change but when you meet him and he begins to deal with your life it doesn't become something of a mandate it becomes a love affair amen hallelujah here's what Jesus said verse 67 please don't go away from me please don't leave me I'll make you a charter member of my church I'll I'll do it what what position do you want what plaque you want your name on a brick outside no that ain't what the word made flesh God Almighty said he said will you go also to the 12 Jesus listen friends if flesh and blood cannot hang on it's got to be the word on the inside oh yes and let me just stop here for a minute if there's something inside of you that despite all your failures despite all your shortcomings despite all the times that you've fallen short but there's something inside of you that says Lord you are all that I have need of I tell you you're blessed you're blessed why brother Samuel look at me you're not to look at yourself you're to look at him that's why he makes himself real in our midst because our righteousness the Bible says it clear is nothing but filthy rags in the sight of God we needed a lamb we needed a king hman we needed a blood that could go to work for us we needed one that could go to battle and deal with the sin question in our life thank you Lord here Peter where are we going to go Peter didn't know everything right now but he knew this where are we going to go you alone have the words of eternal life what was he saying I know what field I'm men I may not understand everything I may not be gleaning everything right now but I ain't leaving this fil it ain't about how much you understand it's do you believe it Jesus never asked do you understand it he said Do you believe [Applause] it Hallelujah hallah and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God who spoke that that representation down on the inside of Peter it spoke out and said this is my field I'm staying right here in this field I'm not leaving I'm I'm not going nowhere else this might be a hard saying it might be a hard say something I need a lot to swallow but I know this is the [Applause] field that takes something de that takes something deeper it'd be like you going to somebody's house and they have your coat at the door and saying you ready to leave I know some of y'all been done that way probably feel like doing me that way sometimes when I come over but but let me tell you if you give somebody their coat they ain't going to feel like well my I really feel welcome about staying around Jesus look you want to go you want to go you see the word listen the word does not come to beg you and I that's right he don't beg us to be Believers he don't beg us to do right that ain't his way his program is he already knew you before the foundation of the world and he knows when this light comes across your pathway just like a seed that you take a seed you can lay concrete over that seed but if there's a seed on the inside that light will go to work that water will go to work on that seed and you can't feel comfortable underneath that concrete I wish I was twice my size this [Laughter] way yes sir this is why Jesus said he said John 8:31 if you continue in my word this is word abide remain keep walking in my word then you're my disciples in deed that means without any you're not just somebody who's followed me but now you have become my disciples indeed notice here here here he prophesies and you shall know the truth now he was the truth didn't he say that I am the truth the life the way but he's talking about a deeper relationship than just knowing him in the flesh but that that is going to be offered up the sacrifice and the truth the holy spirit is going to bring the truth present in your life that you're not the Son and Daughter of so and so you are always a son and daughter of God hallelujah the Lord Jesus stood in Pilot's Hall and he said I have come to Bear witness to the truth what was the truth deity tabernacled in flesh God dwelling in his people that's the truth so staying put don't mean just being complacent right well thank you Lord for saving my soul wow thank you Jesus it don't mean be complacent that's not what he said right he said keep your eyes on the field and where the reapers are at you stay close to my maidens and you follow the Reapers in the field and when you get a little bit you feel like a little bit of parched there's refreshment for you what is he saying to her what is he saying if you and I can draw from this God is more interested in you making it than you are hallu hallah come on now that's right because we're not it's not our desire it's God's desire that we're reflecting God has provided every provision along the way for you and I is that right this is why that even when they came there on the day of Pentecost they asked Peter what must we do to be saved see they realized something's going on here so Peter stands up as a spokesman Anointed with the spirit of God and announces to them this is the promise that God spoke in Joel 2 it's a promise that has laid in the field of God's word you see it's finding him of where he is remember when he arose the Bible said they went to the tomb and found him not right they were finding where he was but you got to know more than just where he was it's where is he and wherever he was where he is he'll still be the same cuz he which was which is and which is to come it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he won't be a different Jesus now than what he was before he'll be the same almighty God doing the same thing is that right in other words when Peter said repent and you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which we're going to do for a little add of here in just a little bit that was a prescription right be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and listen he knew exactly what he was saying and not titles titles will never save you I got titles but I got a name daddy is not a name son is not a name husband is not a name he said the name of the father of the son and of the Holy Ghost and the name is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's the truth that's letting you and I know the evening lights have come this is the field let me just drop this being in the right field is a wonderful thing it's important but the goal is more than just to be in the right field it's to be in him but you first got to recognize his field his word where he's placed his name you got to recognize where he is and when you recognize where he is you can say this is the field I don't understand at all but this is the field I'm not going nowhere I don't care what my friends do I don't care what so and so says I don't care who run who runs this way I don't care what somebody says I'm going to keep my eyes on the Lord Jesus what are you saying Brother Sam I'm not going to be moved and saying hey you need to come over here you need to come over here you need to come over here first of all let me just tell you something you know right away when people go to start pulling on you like that it's wrong God don't pull you he promised he'd lead you because if you follow somebody else is pulling guess what they become your absolute and let me tell you you something you get to lifting up a Man Too High God will let that man make a mistake to shake your confidence back where it needs to be because let me tell you God won't share his glory with no man is that right God won't share with no man so it's recognizing it's selling out to everything else and taking hold of that word let me just drop this scripture in 1 Samuel 15:22 notice here is Samuel speaking to to Saul and Saul remember he had went on and offered up offerings and sacrifice which was not in his authority to do it but I don't want to get caught on that story I want to get focused just and a reread this portion of the scripture of what God is saying about obedience hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams in other words of all of the works and everything that could be done but to fail to obey his voice is failure God will always lead us not only to obey the written word but when he speaks to us he will never speak to us to lead us outside of his word that's why when it's all said and done he had Comm committed all judgment unto his son talking about the word God is committed to lead you personally you believe that am look how important it is you might look in yourself and think I haven't done nothing for God what can I do let me tell you friends you may not you there may not be what you can see a gift in your life everybody has something to offer to God you don't have to try to find it just just stay in the presence of God God will bring it out in its time that's true but the greatest compliment is to obey his voice I wonder how many listen the Bible goes on to say for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and adultery I wonder when the prophet stood there and the godhead explained standing in that hotel room in Chicago and the spirit of God had already told him the room that they've tried to get they will not be able to get it'll be in a room that is this color and this will be the seating arrangement in that room standing right there because they wanted to trap him they wanted to trap him and try to trap that somehow that that that the teaching of the godhead was absolutely wrong but think about how God came in that room and the angel of the Lord stood right there and and the prophet said if I'm wrong you bring your Bible and come stand right here and disprove it quietest bunch of men you saw you know why thank God they had enough smarts than to not try to challenge it because you can't challenge the word are you hearing me now but think about it they many of them even when brother Deus got up now and told him said hey look look look look brother random told us yesterday where every one of you'd be sitting and you'd be wearing and we wouldn't get the original room and it'd be this room and this would be the color of it those men saw that witness they heard it and the presence of God came in there and they began to weep and every many of them I don't know the exact number promised we see it to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're going to come and be baptized not one of them showed up you want to know why here was a woman that raised up in spoken tongues in a different meeting and told them it's not necessary to be re-baptized what did they follow went off one side of the road they follow they put more on the gift oh well you know that's the spirit of God the spirit of God will never lead you outside of the word any spirit that wants to lead you out of the way is a spirit of error amen because the spirit of Truth is come to lead and guide us into all truth amen that's why the Bible said beloved 1 John chapter 4 beloved believe not every Spirit but try it see whether it be of God or not or what's your last name that ain't how you try it do they preach here that ain't how you try it you try it by the word and any gift that will not submit to be Tried by the word does not deserve to be heard that's right that's right ministerial n spiritual does not deserve to be heard because every gift is to be subject to the word of almighty God because if you can't be lead LED you can't lead that's right is that the word let's keep it in the right field listen we've got a promise in this field job was moved he knew there was a promise of Resurrection Abraham knew there was a promise of Resurrection there in the land of Israel he sold he bought that cave of mpil he buried Sarah there he was buried there is that right Jacob was buried there Joseph was buried there you know what that cave of MPA was a type of it was a type of being buried in Christ it meant something what does this field mean to you it means Rapture it means Deliverance it means the change of my body H it means my Liberty it means my justification can I have just a few more minutes let's read these scriptures here Ruth chap 2:10 she fell on her face now this is after he spoke to her biding in the field walk with the maidens take picking up gleaning of the promises she's taking the promise of healing promise of Grace as we were saying hey look if somebody's taken up the promise of Salvation I'll shout with them y'all didn't hear me on that did you I said if somebody's gleaning the promise of Salvation I'll shout with them because I was once there I know there's more I know there's more to be glean but I can Rejoice with somebody that can glean salvation I can Rejoice that we can glean healing in this field oh brother Samuel healing is a minor thing except when you're sick there you go yes sir but that's a promise in this field deliverance and let me just tell you something salvation and deliverance is not just something we experience in our soul but through every trial through every test when things when encroachments of the enemy would want to come around our life he still lets us know I'm your savior I'm your deliverer listen the Hebrew children were not in sin but they were in a fiery furnace and he showed up and made it known I'm still your deliverer you know what they were doing they were gleaning that promise of Deliverance let me tell you what what we have need of God knows how to direct us to what we need to glean and what you might need to glean this service and so and so needs to glean this service might be entirely different but it all comes from him he's the source of all things of all that we have need of Noti she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou should us take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger remember she had no promises in the land of Israel as a matter of fact the last part of her name moabitas was not a very very good Heritage her whole nation was the product of incest right right are you hearing me she wore that over it was that Ruth the moabitas you say why would God still include that in the scripture the same reason he would include in the New Testament Rahab the Harlot not because he regarded her as a harlot but to remind you and I that there's no situation too deep too Bleak too dark that a God ever writes off his Redeeming Grace is greater than your sin it's greater than your doubt God can take a man that's a drug and clean him up God can take a man or a woman that's bound with sin and loose them by the power of the Holy Ghost he included that for you he included that for me not to shame them but to encourage you and I verse 11 Boaz answered and said unto her it hath been fully showed me all that thou Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity look this is part of repentance repentance is just not acknowledging our wrong it's to turn from our ways that's part of repentance repentance is now you're going the de the opposite direction he's calling it out it's been fully revealed to me in other words your repentance I see it it's it's manifest through your life how thou Hast left thy father thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not hitherto you realize she had to leave behind all of her moabit dressings all of her clothes that were moabit fashions right she had to take upon the Fashions of what God regarded in his word as F oh brother Samuel that that's not important that's a promise in God's word to glean now listen friends God will never sweep down over somebody and fill them with the Holy Ghost if they've got a resentful Spirit towards any promise oh I feel the anointing of the spirit of God it will never be a complete feeling because you know why the vessels got to be Sanctified first the spirit of God comes to work to loosen the holds upon our life oh I I need delivered from this I I need from this I really need the Holy Ghost now remember that what we need before the Holy Ghost is the sanctifying work of the blood are you hearing me that's why lives can receive a baptism of the Holy Ghost and it only lasts so long why flesh Spirit never gets down to the right reality right aren't you grateful that God in his Mercy helps us to see the right way you see what Satan would want to do he'd want to bring confusion to you you might have come into that place and my you felt the presence of God you felt oh oh brother Samuel nothing happened to me don't say that there is something that happened to you it's only God drawing upon your heart that you would go deeper it is boas speaking to you hearest thou not my daughter Hallelujah but so many times we pout on God because it don't go my way don't go the way we think it ought to go that's so good remember God is Not mindful to cater to us he said my ways are not your ways is that what he said my ways are higher than your ways but if you allow him remember he's not a dictator he Woos us into a place of submission with him is that right now watch this the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel on under whose wings Thou Art come to trust notice he sees her working she's laboring in the fields she's working it out now remember how many knows the scripture says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling Ruth had come into the land but that's all the further she had done right but thank God she's in the land thank God she's in the land thank God she's in the right field now the prophet said she begins to labor she becomes a legalist through sanctification oh don't don't look at me funny every one of us you pass through that stage and let me just say it to you right now when the Holy Ghost has come does not make you a Loosey Goosey either Hallelujah are you hearing me you still come into a place if then the difference is you've got a rest in your heart and your desire is to please him Above All Things yeah that is what has become overwhelming in our life let let me just try to get somewhere and stop here notice then he says unto her watch this in verse 13 this is so important then he says unto her she says Let Me Find favor or Grace in thy sight my lord for thou Hast comforted me thou H has spoken friendly which means to my inner man thou H has spoken friendly unto thine handmade though I be not like unto one of thine enies how could he speak to her inner man he said my daughter this was not his daughter Ruth of moabitas but that on the inside just like you and I there is nothing out here flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God is that right it takes the spirit of God and God moving over her life and he calls you son he calls you daughter amen is that right he's speaking to the inner man I'm glad it's a mighty voice aren't you I'm glad it's a triumphant voice I'm glad it's a voice of authority that gives you and I the strength to override our own thoughts our own ideas our own feelings about oursel and to believe what he's saying about us amen am that's good Romans 6 16 know you not watch how Paul says to whom ye AB you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be thaned that you were the Servants of sin notice you were the Servants of sin Ruth has come in to the land she's readjusting herself adjusting from all of what she's known the the gity the pentin of food and all that was there and now she's having to glean for food but when Boaz spoke to her it doesn't sound like somebody who's disgruntled that's so good it doesn't sound like somebody who says I got to go out here and labor I got to go out here and pick this up oh we got to do this oh I got to wear this oh that that church up there says you're you're missing the point you can do everything to the letter and still not be obedient and let me just tell you it ain't what the church is saying the church ought to be saying the word but it ought to be according to the word let me tell you friends I've been around long enough where I've heard people say well and people want to ask them why do you wear long skirts why do why do why you why do your women not cut their hair well because our church teaches it shame on you you ought to know that in the scripture and if you don't maybe you're new look there's some things we can we can show you and point it right out in the word of God this ain't something that the message of the hour made up the message of the hour is not a bunch of Creeds and Tenants come on friends it's the word of God it's Christ being revealed it's our protection God ain't trying to take something from you he's trying to give to you what the enemy had wanted to steal from you Satan wants to take your virtue Satan wants to rob you but God is interested in restoring and raising up your virtue it's got to be more than because of mom and daddy says so it's got to be something more than because the church says so it's got to be something deeper than just because well I read it you know and I thank God it's got to be from your heart amen right it's got to come from the heart if you can take that here this morning to recognize what it's all about it's about from your heart obeying god listen friends I've watched God straighten problems up I've watched God straighten lives out I've watched God straighten homes out right but let me tell you something if you don't serve God the Bible said if you're healed it says you go your way and sin no more lest a worse sin come upon you God is not a Ouija board God is not somebody we run to when just we got a little problem and I need a little fix you need more than a fix you need a trip to Calvary and a trip to Calvary will fix your nature it'll fix your problems once and for all where it won't be the same old weeds cropping up it will be the blood that will be transfused into your soul that'll lift you from a life of sin and unbelief I'm talking about promises we're able to glean let me try to close here on this verse 17 but God bethink ye were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered to you that's being then made free from sin ye became the Servants of righteousness over and over God would say it in his word he would say in Exodus 19 in verse in verse three thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel just just stay with me ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for the Earth is mine ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words you should speak to them Exodus 23:20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring thee into the place which I've prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries the Lord Jesus said in John 14:15 if you love me now he's speaking to his disciples this is prior to Calvary if you love me keep my Commandments if you Delight in this field glean glean take of the word take of the word absolutely take of the word yes this is why when many times remember brother Bram over and over ask brother Bram when you going to start teaching how to receive gifts when you going to start teach and what did he say over and over how can I teach them algebra when they won't even learn their ABCs ABCs are things that you can do like brother Bram said to stop cutting your hair that's good to wearing to dressing decently for the men straightening up those are ABCs that you can do and listen by decisions you show your faith in God now I I just would say it like this in this manner if I would find myself here this morning and for some reason that there is something in my heart that seems to resist and kick against the things of God God already knows but I would ask God Lord take that out of me take it out of me yes sir anything that resists any little bit of resistance take it out of me Lord because I don't think anybody in here wants to go through the motions nobody wants to go through the most we didn't come here this morning because of that and he said I will pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive now let me just go to Hebrews 58 I'm coming down I'm coming I want you to see this here I'm turning this I'm turning this corner here though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all that obey him 2 Corinthians 7:1 I love this having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God that's beautiful yeah that's good so not only where lth Ruth and I can remember I can remember that of laboring in the fields before God finishing and completing the work in my life but you know it's never stopped the laboring it's the laboring itself now is the desires and all things I just always want to please him it's not because I have to do this or because that well this is the right thing to do or it's not just something in my mind because sanctification is setting the mind in order for Holiness is that right it's necessary the things that even when God deals with your heart going through Avenues in your life it's important hearts that are seeking for real real work from God where you realize it's not enough for me just to be in the right field that's not the goal I need to meet him amen then God has provided a way and a channel to meet him Ruth could not go from chapter 1 into chapter 3 nor she could she go from chapter 1 into chapter 4 there's a way is that right the Bible said there's the way of Holiness there's a path of righteousness there's a path that opens up God made a way through the Red Sea God makes a way this is why that to a real desire in a heart of a Believer we're not interested in dodging any promise of God we want to obtain every promise that's right yes and I believe this ought to be the the part of it in 1 John chapter 3 pull that up with you Brianna please I thinking this is where I was thinking of when we sang that song Keep Me Sanctified maybe as the musicians will make their way up because we in our journey even along the way there's things that God continues to work out of our life and throughout our journey through places we go through everything we need a continual sanctifying and there's the promise of Ephesians 5 he will wash us with the water of the word that's good yes sir so even when you take the scripture work out your own salvation with fear and trembling that can refer to sanctification but it also refers to on and on as God deals with our heart across the word that no matter where we're standing it's that time time that where we take account of our own soul and say Yes Lord yes Lord God deals with our life you know sometimes on the things with sanctification God sanctifying in our life now I'm talking about even I I wanted to bring this to this place that even for lives that you've already experienced that of the rest of the Kinsman work sin question is settled but there's there's a work that goes on in our life that where there's things that God's called us to take a stand upon his word God's called us to stand upon that word without compromising remember with those that said to brother brandham and brother Bram answers it like this well brother Bram I really don't have to go to church on Sunday brother Bram said you need to be legal on some things they said oh I'm not a legalist he said you need to be legal on some things you need to be legal on that right there so there's many things that through the word see when the spirit of God has come it don't make us loose right the more mature the more that Christ was moving in your heart the greater the desire is to please him it goes from you and I making decisions about things that's right and wrong to where you can looking at look at things that could be right and right and you're looking at it in a manner to say Lord what is the right one that will further your will in my life are you hearing me where where it's no longer that it just keeps on climbing and it and this is why that even within Paul would say all things are lawful unto me but not all things are expedient notice the scripture right here leaves us to think now we are the sons of God and it does not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that ha this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure that's so beautiful yes sir aren't you glad there's a source oh yes there's a source there's a fountain that's open in the House of David not only to cleanse from the vness of sin but there's a fountain that's open that as God deals with our lives and there's things sometimes it's a test or trial that'll come our way that'll begin to show certain things about our character and that's a moment of dying right there that's a moment of purifying and say yep I my expectation is I'm going to see him and this whatever this is right here it's not worth holding on to that's right he's my everything and God has permitted a test or trial to bring a purifying in our life true I I want to be that way don't you I want to be that way I want the word to continue to wash me to wash me I'm not laboring in a sense of of to be found favor yet you might be this morning laboring to enter into rest and I'm telling you your labor is it's not against God but your labor is against your own will if you'll just let your own will go to him if you'll just surrender to him the the real key is is Lord let me fall in love with you let me fall in love with you I believe right here this morning that his grace is sufficient to say Lord let a great big bundle of love just re refreshing just drop down in My Heart Lord maybe you found dryness or maybe there's parchedness Maybe hearing this from just the cares of life not because of sin but just the cares of life and you say Lord I need some refreshment Lord I need refreshment Lord just that refreshment you know how it is you can get so weak and you get that refreshment and you're like I'm ready to go again I'm ready to get back in there and begin to glean God knows just how to bring that refreshment to us let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this is truly Lord a burden in our hearts thank you Lord for these little moments that you've given us to be able to look upon your word and where you would draw our attention on the value of obedience sometimes Lord the things that you've asked us to do sometimes Lord we in our own selves we don't altogether see the value or the full value of it Ruth where she was at in gleaning she was gleaning for Life gleaning for food it wasn't even until later in this chapter that when she comes back and Naomi sees what she has in her possession that Naomi would begin to worship that God being mindful of his word God has taken notice of us our Kinsman has made himself known our boas Naomi would follow in the concluding parts of this same chapter make sure Ruth that he does not find you in another field his maidens don't let anybody find you in a different field stay in this field it's the kindness of the lord it's the mercy of God he is our near Kinsman Ruth's gleanings would go from gleaning salvation Grace forgiveness Deliverance now now at that utterance she would now begin to glean the promises of redemption in that of a Kinsman she had gleaned in that first part of the field she had gleaned a new heart a new spirit but your promise is that you would give your spirit and cause us to keep your ways Lord Jesus as you've told us in your word no man can come to you except that we're given by the father except to be drawn Lord Jesus just like a part that would be like probably for all of us to understand right [Music] now kind of like a cell phone in the sense that if that cell phone doesn't have a SIM card in it you could try to call it and call it and call it it might even be turned on but if it don't have anything to receive that call and it's not been activated to the network it will not be able to receive anything it will not be able to receive the call but Lord God if there's a drawing there's a yearning even Lord Upon A Heart here this morning morning Lord God whether it's visitor or whether Lord It's one Lord God that stands right here in the gates Lord Lord there's a drawing upon the heart then father that's you speaking friendly to that life you're speaking to their heart that their heart Lord would be turned would be open to you frankly Lord you never stop stop speaking to our hearts that's what you speak to Lord you continue to speak to our lives Lord I pray this morning if there's one that does not know you in that way maybe Lord God that they've just come into the field but they find themselves Lord God and maybe they've come into the field but they find themselves resisting certain things may they Lord God realize they need some refreshment and Lord I Ask of You Lord Change My Heart Lord Turn My Heart Lord God soften it Lord I don't want to do things because it's just simply the right things to do I believe there's honor in that but Lord I want a heart behind it I don't just live true to my wife because I know it's the right thing to do I love her I love her and I know she loves me I wouldn't want to do anything Lord to hurt [Music] her I don't I don't do what I do because I'm afraid she'd leave me I love her she's the queen of our [Music] home Lord God she loves me in that way oh Lord we have our shortcomings we have to ask one another forgive me I shouldn't have said that that way forgive me I I should have let you know about this or I should have mentioned this was going to take [Music] place Lord that's part of staying in this field Even in our marriage but how much more in our walk with you Lord Lord I pray through this building this morning I've not Lord just stood here to speak a word that would just speak Lord to a heart that would be in a moment of laboring but to realize Lord that song that when I came to the platform this morning may it be the desire of our heart Lord keep me Sanctified Lord God I want to stay Lord in that place Paul himself he said I'm pressing toward the mark of the High Calling of Christ Jesus my Lord he admonished us lay aside every weight anything that's slowing you down lay it aside and every sin that does so easily beset you Lord God as he would put the hand of the believer in the hand of God and said dearly beloved seeing we have these precious promises let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the spirit and of the flesh perfecting Holiness in the fear of God lord Jesus I'm thankful I'm thankful that not only Lord God my hand to be put in your hand but my life to be put in to your hands you know what I have need of Lord you know what each of us have need of you know the working in each of Our Lives Lord God more than anything if Paul could stand there and say lest I be a cast away when I have preached to others we're not taking these things for granted Lord but I want to see more of you Lord Lord and less of me keep me Sanctified Lord God let me stay under that washing of Water by the word Lord God that sanctifying and cleansing flow Lord God that privilege that we have as Believers as Sons and Daughters of God that our lives could be purged Lord and clean Lord God oh Father when the stench of the world Lord when we get around the world we don't ask to see certain things we don't ask to hear certain things but Lord sometimes we can get caught in the things Lord God that we're hearing and that we're seeing and Lord God it can affect us in our spirit help us Lord help us Lord may we never be too big Lord to present ourselves before you Lord oh God that this word that you provided in this hour to wash us and cleanse us Lord there's a work to be done Lord God and how I thank you for this field I'm so grateful to be here Lord I'm Grateful to know you in the power of your Resurrection in The Fellowship of your suffering thank you Father Lord we love [Music] you we commit this service
