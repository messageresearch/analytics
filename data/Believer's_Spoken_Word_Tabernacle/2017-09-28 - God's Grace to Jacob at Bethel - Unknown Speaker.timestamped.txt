[42:57] John here with us amen verse 10 of
[43:01] Genesis 28 Jacob went out of there Sheba
[43:05] and went toward Iran and he lighted upon
[43:09] a certain place and tarried there all
[43:11] night because the son was sent and he
[43:14] took of the stones of that place and put
[43:16] them for his pillows and laid down in
[43:18] that place to sleep and he dreamed and
[43:21] behold a ladder set up upon the earth
[43:24] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[43:26] behold the angels of God ascending and
[43:28] descending on it and behold the Lord
[43:31] stood above it and said I am the Lord
[43:33] God of Abraham thy father and the god of
[43:36] Isaac the land were on thou liest to
[43:39] thee will I give it and to thy seed and
[43:41] thy seed shall be as the dust of the

[44:17] bless the reading of the word I'd like
[44:20] just to speak to you just open up a
[44:24] little bit on a little thought God's
[44:26] grace to Jacob at Bethel and I want to
[44:31] just look over some things here that
[44:33] just was really just inspiring to my
[44:36] heart you find that how that that Jacob
[44:42] here when he
[44:44] is directed and sent forth by by his dad
[44:50] in that in the beginning part of Genesis
[44:53] 28 find that how that in the midst of it
[44:57] that you know there are things that that
[45:01] are set forth that's pretty clear when
[45:03] you you look at that in in Genesis 28
[45:06] and verse 2 and how that Isaac tells
[45:09] Jacob where to go arise and go to
[45:12] Madonna rom to the house of Bethel thy
[45:15] mother's father and take the ax wife
[45:17] from thence of the daughters of Laban
[45:19] thy mother's brother there are things
[45:22] that God has written in his word he's
[45:25] already laid out a pattern and God is
[45:28] one he doesn't change patterns his
[45:32] pattern ever remains the same we we know
[45:34] there are things that God will will
[45:36] change and it becomes magnified from the
[45:39] old into the new but when you look at
[45:42] how that Isaac is is aware of this and
[45:45] we know that his mother has heard about
[45:47] Esau 'ls intention to to take his life
[45:51] but yet how that Rebekah you know has
[45:54] spoke to him go go to the land where my
[45:57] brother is out and Iran and take the
[45:59] wife she speaks to Jacob and Jacob gives
[46:02] him a charge and a commission these are
[46:04] not just words but it's God that is
[46:07] watching over Jacobs life and so when we
[46:12] look at it Isaac you know see Isaac is
[46:14] not just telling something that he's
[46:17] just read about but Isaac himself is
[46:20] giving of the experience of his own life
[46:23] because for him his bride his wife Jacob
[46:27] and Esau his mother Rebecca did not come
[46:30] from the land around there but she came
[46:32] from the land of of the kindred of the
[46:36] the kinfolk and so we find that this
[46:39] pattern you know you find that many
[46:40] times in God's Word sometimes we are we
[46:43] look for answers sometimes and we look
[46:45] right over the very things that God has
[46:47] right within his word because we find
[46:50] that that God has had a pattern and
[46:52] Isaac is letting this pattern Isaac's
[46:55] taking the word and he's guiding and his
[46:57] correcting Jacob on where to go and
[46:59] where to take a wife from and we find
[47:02] that when here Isaac the scripture lets
[47:05] us know of how that Isaac he sent Jacob
[47:07] away and you think of it how that here
[47:10] Jacob is sent away by Isaac and he goes
[47:13] away from the land where where he's been
[47:17] raised their land where he's been born
[47:19] and everything but now he's to journey
[47:21] back to the land of Haran and no doubt
[47:24] when you would think about that for a
[47:26] moment that was a great sacrifice that
[47:29] was a great price that was being asked
[47:32] of him to leave where he had always
[47:35] known but you know that's the same
[47:37] pattern that's been all the way down
[47:40] through the scriptures that God will
[47:42] require a separation and the separation
[47:46] that God will require is that everything
[47:49] that we hold dear to ourselves there
[47:52] can't be anything that can be placed
[47:55] before the Lord if the Lord Jesus said
[47:57] it very clear he said if a man is not
[48:00] willing to forsake father mother houses
[48:03] lands and other things he's not even
[48:05] worthy to be called my disciple so the
[48:08] Word of God demands a complete
[48:10] separation but when it demands or calls
[48:14] for that complete separation God is
[48:16] doing that to bring really the
[48:18] separation isn't so much from all of the
[48:21] people as it is for that self part that
[48:24] self-denial that we you and I are able
[48:27] to walk away and there's nothing else in
[48:30] our life that we desire more than what
[48:32] God is speaking to us and I believe that
[48:35] with all my heart that God in every age
[48:37] God has always any expects us to
[48:40] separate from everything that we hold
[48:43] dear in our life and if there's anything
[48:45] at all that we love more than him then
[48:47] we're not worthy to be his disciples
[48:49] we're tested on that you know friends
[48:51] that don't just stop we're testing on
[48:54] that if we will love our feeling if we
[48:56] will love our thoughts more than the
[48:58] Word of God but we've got to cast down
[49:00] all reasoning it requires us to make a
[49:04] stand many times against our own
[49:06] feelings about things and stand for the
[49:09] word of God but you
[49:10] with in at all the reward itself far
[49:12] exceeds the request bury the reward and
[49:16] the requester there's not even anything
[49:18] that's comparable the reward Farley far
[49:21] LC exceeds it find that how that
[49:24] remember Peter you know Peter and them
[49:27] were asking you know seeing that we have
[49:29] forsaken all we have left all and
[49:32] followed be in mark 10:28 I like how it
[49:34] reads it like this jesus answered and
[49:37] said verily I say unto you there is no
[49:39] man that hath left house or brethren or
[49:42] sisters or father or mother or wife or
[49:46] children or lands from my sake and the
[49:49] gospel's but he shall receive an
[49:52] hundredfold now in this time houses and
[49:55] brethren and sisters and mothers and
[49:58] children and lands with persecutions my
[50:08] everything was going good until that
[50:11] latter part he shall receive with
[50:15] persecutions and in the world to come
[50:19] eternal life amen
[50:22] now look how the Prophet lays this out
[50:25] here when we we think of it Abraham he
[50:28] says in the message reproached for calls
[50:30] of the word Abraham the very word Abram
[50:33] means father of many and make him a
[50:35] father of Nations and Abraham heard the
[50:38] word of God
[50:39] Abram was a prophet and he heard the
[50:41] word of God and we admire Abraham for
[50:43] his holding to God's Word how that he
[50:46] separated himself from his kin folks how
[50:48] hard it was for Abraham he was brought
[50:51] up there now what's for the rain I'm
[50:54] dealing with the soul realm no he's
[50:56] talking about the spirit realm how hard
[51:00] it was for Abraham he was brought up
[51:03] there he come down from Babel was down
[51:06] there in the land of Shinar the
[51:08] Chaldeans in the city of Ur where all of
[51:10] his associates people and those he went
[51:12] to church with and everything but God
[51:14] said separate yourself what a horrible
[51:17] thing that was to leave all that he held
[51:21] dear everything that was
[51:22] real to him that he held dear and God
[51:25] told him separates yourself so it wasn't
[51:30] something that was it wasn't easy but
[51:32] everything that was real to him
[51:35] everything that was precious to Abraham
[51:37] God is calling him out of his comfort
[51:40] zone oh my oh my god is moving to Koli
[51:47] you know when you remember in the
[51:48] scriptures where it speaks in thee and
[51:51] the scriptures where God has has now
[51:54] come among the church and he's poured
[51:56] out of his spirit and the Bible says of
[51:59] how that they they sold what they had
[52:02] and and they brought it and laid it at
[52:03] the Apostles feet and the Bible says
[52:05] they had all things in common you know
[52:08] God's desire within I remember how many
[52:10] would look at that and say oh they made
[52:12] such a great mistake they had nowhere
[52:14] else to go but he wasn't a mistake God
[52:17] did not want you to become a communal
[52:20] thing where it becomes something of us
[52:23] for and no more where it becomes to
[52:26] where that it's just a focus about us
[52:28] and the focus isn't upon the Word of God
[52:30] and the gospel being spread God knows
[52:33] exactly what he's doing
[52:35] with the places that he places you and I
[52:37] you and I sometimes don't understand the
[52:40] ways that God would call in direct
[52:42] across no pathways and I don't want to
[52:44] say just sometimes we don't understand
[52:46] we don't know the fullness it's not
[52:48] things that you and I can't even figure
[52:51] out and make sense I've been many times
[52:53] it's later on down the Ray that you and
[52:55] I can look back and say Lord I see now
[52:58] why that you led me this way why you
[53:01] guided me this direction but in the time
[53:03] it just doesn't make sense but that is
[53:06] where faith comes in please can't
[53:11] explain faith in us and the faith
[53:13] understands faith simply trusts this is
[53:17] what he has said now notice how the
[53:19] Prophet will lay this out in power
[53:21] transformation he said see whatever it
[53:23] is that's what we want I believe it was
[53:26] David that said I'd rather be a doorman
[53:28] at the house of the Lord than to dwell
[53:30] in the tents with the wicked you see no
[53:32] matter what it is take my place
[53:34] sometimes you have to
[53:36] separate from everything that's dear on
[53:39] earth to you to take your position that
[53:42] God has called you to
[53:43] he says I'm sure you can read between
[53:45] the lines when I'm saying sometimes the
[53:47] very dearest person on earth you have to
[53:50] shake hands with them and just take your
[53:52] position in Christ to where God has
[53:54] called you but what is God doing
[53:57] transforming you from what you are
