[41:14] amen amen God bless you tonight amen we
[41:18] want to go straight to the word of the
[41:19] Lord and want to go to First Corinthians
[41:21] chapter 12 here
[41:23] tonight and uh
[41:33] I want to if the Lord would just to to
[41:35] help us I'd like to finish out here
[41:38] tonight at least on that of the faith
[41:41] and then transition over here very
[41:43] quickly into that of gifts of healing
[41:47] and uh start into
[41:50] that here in verse 4 of 1 Corinthians 12
[41:54] it says now there are diversities of
[41:56] gifts
[41:57] but the same spirit and there are
[42:00] differences of administration but the
[42:03] same lord and there are diversities of
[42:06] operations but it is the same God which
[42:09] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[42:13] of the spirit is given to every man to
[42:16] profit with all or rather to profit all
[42:20] for to one is given by the spirit the
[42:23] word of wisdom and to another the word
[42:27] of knowledge by The Same Spirit and to
[42:30] another Faith by the same spirit amen
[42:34] may God bless you and bless the reading
[42:36] of the word as you're being seated I'd
[42:38] like
[42:39] to continue to speak there tonight on
[42:43] those the other spiritual gifts
[42:47] we often times where we deal with uh so
[42:51] readily upon the three that would seem
[42:53] to be the most notable or as Paul would
[42:57] spend uh much of the time under the
[43:00] leading of the holy spirit in the
[43:02] direction of those three gifts and to
[43:04] realize that every gift and brother
[43:07] Brown would say it over and over through
[43:09] the message that if in each of these
[43:12] gifts if we can just have them
[43:14] completely under the control of the Holy
[43:17] Spirit and his leading brother brm says
[43:20] then you will watch what Pentecost would
[43:22] rise to and he would speak of of of that
[43:27] uh Glory of when the gifts themselves
[43:29] would be positioned and we realize over
[43:33] and over as we've said is that the gifts
[43:35] being put in their place does not mean
[43:38] that they've been put in
[43:40] storage nor have they been given away as
[43:43] though that they're no longer useful God
[43:46] put it in the body it will be here in
[43:48] the body until we are changed and it is
[43:52] a necessary part of the body however
[43:56] within that of
[43:57] gifts uh the nine spiritual gifts we
[44:00] recognize that within it um as we've
[44:04] looked at it that the operation of any
[44:06] of those is no sign or evidence of a
[44:10] Spirit-filled individual but it is as
[44:13] the prophet tells us the manifestation
[44:15] or the evidence that it is the spirit
[44:18] doing that work through the individual
[44:21] and this is where that the spirit of God
[44:23] that after the gifts have been uh
[44:25] restored then then God sends the message
[44:29] after isua Street has come along in 1906
[44:32] then God sends the message of the hour
[44:36] and within that promise of the ministry
[44:38] of the son of man it puts everything
[44:41] within its place of where that it would
[44:44] should rightfully be and to know that
[44:47] every member uh one that would be
[44:50] baptized into the body of Jesus Christ
[44:53] the prophet said is subject to any one
[44:55] of these nine spiritual gifts
[44:57] at any time and so when we look at this
[45:01] we know that it's it's all about the
[45:03] unction and the leading of the Holy
[45:05] Spirit as we've been seeing this and
[45:08] what a what a glorious what a glorious
[45:11] uh way it is of god to display his
[45:14] attitude towards the church we know that
[45:16] his word is the ultimate and brother bam
[45:19] tells us that when these gifts even as
[45:21] they themselves would be manifest it's
[45:23] God's attitude towards the people it's
[45:27] God's attitude he said towards healing
[45:29] and most of these within different
[45:31] things within our lives much of it that
[45:33] we look at would a lot of times center
[45:36] around healing but I'm glad that God uh
[45:39] just does not have uh a word or even
[45:43] that of the gifts just to center around
[45:45] healing but God knows all of those
[45:48] things that we could even be faced with
[45:50] in life and even to where that the Holy
[45:53] Spirit can give us uh the word of wisdom
[45:55] and direction for our lives when things
[45:58] are set before us like he did for
[45:59] Solomon God can also give us that of of
[46:03] knowledge and just like brother Brown
[46:05] would give that example sometimes that
[46:06] would actually come together and you can
[46:09] see it reflected within prophecy and
[46:11] brother Brown would tell us about you
[46:13] know tell those in this community move
[46:15] out of the way right now because there's
[46:17] going to be a flood or so forth that's
[46:19] coming through there and you know see
[46:21] that's the mercy of God because every
[46:23] single time it doesn't happen that way
[46:26] there's been others that's experienced
[46:28] sometimes destruction to experience
[46:30] different things I think of I think of
[46:32] uh brother Doug Baker out there and uh
[46:35] Tucson Arizona and my wife and I were
[46:36] out there in the first part of November
[46:39] here he was in the midst of having a
[46:40] meeting and the meeting getting ready to
[46:42] start and a fire comes and burns down
[46:45] the church and they don't burn it all
[46:47] the way down but you know it just they
[46:49] weren't able to have the meetings as far
[46:50] as in that church and no doubt I mean
[46:53] what that would have meant or how that
[46:55] would have you know felt for them at the
[46:56] time but I'll tell you I was out there
[46:59] and to see that the work and things that
[47:01] was done and how beautiful it is it's
[47:03] gotten very much like a wood ceiling
[47:05] like this is set up and it's kind of
[47:06] almost like a an octagonal shape and
[47:09] things but you know sometimes we wonder
[47:11] and you know you can look at that and
[47:13] say well why didn't God warn them or why
[47:15] didn't God warn them or this one or that
[47:17] one but you know what God never promised
[47:19] that he would warn us every step of the
[47:21] way there might have been things nobody
[47:23] was there in the church there might have
[47:25] been things when we look at that flood
[47:27] that brother bam gives an example
[47:29] whether it's a flood move out of this
[47:30] neighborhood or whatever we understand
[47:32] this one thing that there's nothing can
[47:35] take our life until God's purpose has
[47:38] been fulfilled and so I'm thankful to
[47:41] the Lord to know that when we can rest
[47:43] within that to know that God does have
[47:45] everything in control it's in his it's
[47:47] in his hands it's in his season and so
[47:50] when we look at this here I want to just
[47:53] uh deal with this just a little bit more
[47:55] here on another fa by The Same Spirit
[47:58] and brother BR in dealing with this on
[48:00] that gift of faith he says it like this
[48:03] he says now I'll give you a little story
[48:05] of someone who came so you can see what
[48:07] faith is Faith is a gift itself you may
[48:12] have a portion of it but there is a gift
[48:15] of faith he said like some you some of
[48:17] you people anoint the sick and pray for
[48:20] them and you have a result now brother
[48:22] Bram goes on through that and I I read
[48:24] from that uh within the message because
[48:26] it's a common theme where even different
[48:29] ones remember they were asking brother
[48:30] Branham Tommy Osborne was one of them uh
[48:33] others that would ask brother Bram said
[48:34] when he would get ready to leave town
[48:36] they would ask brother Bram would you
[48:37] lay hands on me that God will give me
[48:40] that gift of healing and brother Bram
[48:41] says there's only one direct gift of
[48:44] healing only one direct gift of faith
[48:48] and he goes through all of those
[48:49] different gifts and to recognize that
[48:51] it's not something that lays within a
[48:54] man but it is that which comes from the
[48:56] the Fountain of almighty God and how
[48:59] that when we like the Bible tells us in
[49:01] Psalms 1 verse 1-3 the prophet will pull
[49:05] that out in restoration of the Bride
[49:06] tree and deal with of how that those
[49:08] streams that would be flowing out are
[49:10] the nine spiritual gifts and so to
[49:13] recognize that it's not something that
[49:15] is particular to one person can there be
[49:18] a person that God would seem to use uh
[49:21] very often yes this is why that brother
[49:23] Brandon would say even in different
[49:25] times when tongues would go forth he
[49:27] said now just be patient be quiet he
[49:28] says there's those here that have a gift
[49:31] of interpretation and recognizing that
[49:34] it seems to be within this individual
[49:36] like you'd say brother higab Botham is
[49:38] he here tonight because there would be a
[49:40] tendency or frequency within their lives
[49:43] you know I'm not I'm not in any way to
[49:45] try to figure that out I I just know
[49:48] that you know it's subject to anyone who
[49:50] is in the body and this is why brother
[49:52] Bram says you want to be setting
[49:54] reverent and sensitive because that
[49:56] interpretation might fall upon you so
[49:59] it's it's something to where that you
[50:02] sometimes we can see even in those
[50:04] Tendencies but yet it is God sovereignly
[50:07] moving and moving down in a special way
[50:09] with this gift of faith and brother B
[50:11] says a gift of faith is not something
[50:14] you take and do something with but a
[50:17] gift of faith is you just get yourself
[50:20] out of the way the gift is getting your
[50:23] own self out of the way so then when we
[50:28] recognize that it's something that is is
[50:30] is there that is appropriated by the
[50:33] word of God and God would you know as we
[50:35] looked at that last week that it's not
[50:37] the faith of the individual of the of
[50:40] the whoever is praying for us that heals
[50:42] us remember over and over in the
[50:44] scriptures we looked at it that Jesus
[50:46] would say according to your faith thy
[50:49] faith so so what it does it's putting it
[50:52] that Faith itself brother Ram will say
[50:54] this over and over in the message and
[50:56] I'll and I'll refer to one place here in
[50:57] a little bit where brother says I'm
[50:59] hearing so much of this about super
[51:01] duper faith and he said you know he said
[51:03] it's nonsense because he's dealing with
[51:06] that Faith itself is something that is
[51:08] Within Reach of every individual
[51:11] remember when they plied the blood down
[51:13] in Egypt they applied it with hup and
[51:15] brother B said hisop is a common weed he
[51:18] said that's what faith is Faith is
[51:20] common so it's not that we don't have
[51:23] faith but sometimes maybe our faith has
[51:25] gotten a little weak can God comes by to
[51:28] inspire our faith that's where with
[51:30] these gifts as they will come in many
[51:32] times within this of G gift of faith and
[51:35] Gifts of healing and and Gifts of
[51:37] Miracles and and these things it will
[51:39] come by to inspire our faith and that's
[51:42] why brother Brown would say oh the
[51:43] devil's getting nervous because he knows
[51:46] just a little bit more and just a little
[51:48] bit of Faith added and the devil's
[51:51] whipped so God is moving in such a way
[51:54] you know it's aware that you know Faith
[51:56] moving together like brother Ram says
[51:58] I'm going to put my faith with your
[52:00] faith and and our prayer joined together
[52:03] and and we're going to reach there and
[52:05] get the promise of God so you know God
[52:07] is not worried uh and looking at us and
[52:10] saying well you don't have the faith
[52:12] that's needed but God has confidence in
[52:14] his word that when Faith would move down
[52:16] in a sovereign way within a meeting God
[52:19] has confidence that that's what you and
[52:21] I have need of to be able to step right
[52:23] out and and if it's something just to
[52:25] move right on to our healing whatever it
[52:27] is that we can keep walking on with God
[52:31] and you know what there's times from
[52:32] here times here and there that we need
[52:35] these times the where that the spirit of
[52:37] God will just move down and and you know
[52:40] minister to us in such a such a special
[52:43] way to me I don't want to limit God in
[52:45] any way neither do I want to you know
[52:47] some way just you know as though that
[52:49] sometimes say well you know if if I
[52:51] really had Faith because you know the
[52:53] devil has such a way of being able to
[52:55] take quotes and actually isolate people
[52:58] from the blessings that they have need
[53:00] of brother B will say this in perfect
[53:02] Faith oh brother Bram I got all perfect
[53:04] Faith he said well if you had perfect
[53:05] Faith what are you doing up here in the
[53:07] prayer line you see how Satan will take
[53:09] a quote like that and he'll absolutely
[53:12] so run down and minimize the people of
[53:15] God as though that oh they're weak in
[53:17] faith let me just tell you something the
[53:19] promises also they shall lay hands on
[53:21] the sick and they shall recover so it's
[53:24] no weakness of Faith cuz an action in
[53:26] order to even receive healing through
[53:29] hands being laid on it actually requires
[53:33] faith in the word of God so it's no it's
[53:36] no no less of Faith but you know what
[53:39] God can drop Faith right there within
[53:41] our hearts while we're hearing the word
[53:43] of God go forth things can be cleared
[53:45] out of our life hindrances and God can
[53:48] move right down in and just the word of
[53:50] God would just do for us what we have
[53:53] need of and when you look here at a gift
[53:55] of faith I I'm not going to read it here
[53:58] but you know in referring to when Israel
[54:00] came to the Red Sea the prophet tells us
[54:03] this gift of faith that Moses had in his
[54:05] life and how that when they came here to
[54:08] the Red Sea Moses prophesies in Exodus
[54:11] 14 and he tells them fear you not stand
[54:15] still and you'll see the salvation of
[54:17] the Lord which he'll show you today the
[54:19] Egyptians you see today you're not going
[54:21] to see him again no more the Lord's
[54:23] going to fight for you hold your peace
[54:25] and then when when he turns to the Lord
[54:29] God speaks to him and says very familiar
[54:32] to us why criest thou unto me speak unto
[54:35] the children of Israel that they go
[54:37] forward so this gift of faith that was
[54:40] moved at the time and Moses prophesies I
[54:44] mean there is no question that this is
[54:47] faith that has rose up at that time as a
[54:50] matter fact brother Bram says it just
[54:52] like this uh in why Christ speak that
[54:54] this was not Moses's thought this was
[54:58] God moving down in a sovereign way even
[55:02] before that he prophesied and then after
[55:05] he prophesied God allowed us to see the
[55:08] humanity that would still be there and
[55:09] brother BR would say this over and over
[55:11] in why Christ speak he says isn't that
[55:14] just like us like humans he said isn't
[55:17] that just like me and he goes into place
[55:20] himself there but you see God inspires
[55:23] and and ministers to Moses to where then
[55:26] Moses Moses then would step forward and
[55:28] he and he encourages the people of God
[55:31] but he's speaking that they would go
[55:33] forward a faith to move forward and he
[55:36] takes that of the rod that God has given
[55:39] to him and he holds that out over the
[55:41] waters and the waters part and we know
[55:43] that Israel walked on over on dry land
[55:46] there's times where there's situations
[55:49] in our lives that are not always uh with
[55:51] that of physical healing it might be
[55:53] emotional healing it might be uh needs
[55:56] maybe on a job it might be situations
[55:59] that's come up with housing finances
[56:01] whatever it is sometimes God can use
[56:04] that of a gift of faith to operate right
[56:07] through that way to encourage you and I
[56:09] sometimes it'll come right while the
[56:11] preaching of the word is going forth
[56:13] because that's God's Ultimate Way is
[56:15] because when everything in order for it
[56:17] to hold out it's got to be based upon
[56:19] the word of God so there's times that
[56:22] God will work in that way and Inspire in
[56:25] that manner then again God can move down
[56:27] with that and a gift of faith in such a
[56:29] sovereign way uh operating it in a
[56:32] different way or in that manner notice
[56:34] how Paul here he is and you're familiar
[56:37] with this point in the scripture where
[56:39] Paul here he is he's he's ministering
[56:42] and the Bible says there was a certain
[56:43] man at Lyra impotent in his feet being a
[56:47] from his mother's womb who never
[56:49] had walked the same heard Paul speak now
[56:53] this is what's key he heard Paul PA
[56:56] speak Faith cometh by hearing and
[57:00] hearing by the word of God and notice
[57:03] who steadfastly beholding him and
[57:06] perceiving that he had Faith to be
[57:10] healed now what was that that caused
[57:13] that Faith to arise it was the preaching
[57:17] of the word of God it became so clear to
[57:20] this man it became so tangible to where
[57:24] that God would direct Paul to actually
[57:26] see that this man had Faith to be healed
[57:30] and he tells him with a loud voice stand
[57:33] upright on thy feet and he leaped and
[57:35] walked and so now brother brandham will
[57:38] will give different examples of those
[57:41] within even the body at that time that
[57:44] God was using and he says you know I've
[57:46] seen Oral Roberts praying for a little
[57:48] sick baby up in Canada had a bad eye I
[57:51] believe the parents was Catholic and
[57:53] brother Roberts in his real way of of
[57:56] Faith he slammed his hand down on the
[57:59] little baby and prayed for it and the
[58:01] little baby was healed and brother BR
[58:04] said now that's a real gift of faith
[58:07] that brother Roberts has and we know
[58:10] that brother Jack Cole he used to have a
[58:12] little Anvil laying by the side of his
[58:14] desk now remember anytime people came up
[58:17] and glasses and you know crutches snap
[58:20] he he would smash them right on the
[58:22] Anvil snap them and and everything else
[58:24] now that was Jack Cole remember his
[58:27] faith brother ram calls this a bulldog
[58:30] faith and you know these men were so
[58:32] built within that part of Faith within
[58:35] the promises of God's word remember what
[58:37] brother Ram says and we'll get to this a
[58:39] little bit later on down the line in
[58:41] Gifts of healing he said if I could
[58:43] preach like AA Allen I wouldn't have to
[58:46] have the prayer lines because he spoke
[58:48] of how AA Allen was gifted to be able to
[58:52] build the faith of the People by the
[58:55] word of God
[58:56] now you know to
[58:58] me then you know when I'm listening to
[59:00] the message of the hour I I don't have
[59:02] to wait to a prayer line in order for my
[59:05] faith to be built you know what's being
[59:07] built is the is the word as God the
[59:09] presence of God remember it's the word
[59:11] of God that brings the presence of God
[59:14] in the beginning when there was darkness
[59:16] and void upon the Earth the Bible says
[59:19] that God said let there be light so it
[59:22] was the word brother B said that spoke
[59:24] to the darkness give way that the light
[59:27] can shine through so that's exactly when
[59:30] the word comes within that way it's to
[59:32] scatter the darkness and build our faith
[59:35] within the promise of God's word now
[59:38] brother br will go on and he'll talk
[59:39] about you know with brother Roberts and
[59:41] and and them and he says now brother
[59:43] Roberts is the gift of healing he prays
[59:46] and lays hands on the sick like that and
[59:49] got a real dominating hard as we'd call
[59:52] it Bulldog faith it just stands up there
[59:55] with his eyes closed and he believes
[59:57] that God will do it if he ask it and
[59:59] just lays his hands on the people as
[1:00:01] they pass by and that's what the Bible
[1:00:03] said lay hands on the sick and they
[1:00:05] shall recover so here's a here's a gift
[1:00:10] a gift of faith and brother BR would
[1:00:12] pick out two individuals you know
[1:00:14] there's others that that would be there
[1:00:15] you could have picked out AA Allen all
[1:00:17] the rest of them and you you can look
[1:00:19] and say with some of some that you
[1:00:21] mentioned brother Samuel along with
[1:00:23] different ones Richard Hall on and on
[1:00:25] all these different ones you could pull
[1:00:27] out and say but but what about there's
[1:00:29] certain things I heard about their lives
[1:00:30] remember the non-spiritual gifts how
[1:00:34] that these very things can work through
[1:00:36] a life and yet the life itself not be
[1:00:40] genuine is that right this is why that
[1:00:43] we don't follow
[1:00:45] gifts we follow the word because if you
[1:00:48] follow a gift it could lead you right
[1:00:50] out of the
[1:00:51] word is that right balam himself the
[1:00:54] prophet said had a gift of faith oh he
[1:00:56] said it could have been a blessing if he
[1:00:58] would have used it with the perfect word
[1:01:00] of God but you know what it was balam
[1:01:03] was not willing to surrender I know he
[1:01:05] was a prophet all that worked in his
[1:01:07] life but he wasn't willing to actually
[1:01:09] come under the subjection of the word
[1:01:12] because even when God told him the first
[1:01:14] time not to go down there with BAC or
[1:01:17] bik's men and then you know he said nope
[1:01:19] I can't go I God I I just can't go with
[1:01:22] you then here came back others with
[1:01:24] different treasure and remember when
[1:01:26] they came back balam at that moment
[1:01:28] could have said God don't change his
[1:01:30] mind I I don't care how much money you
[1:01:33] have to offer me God don't change his
[1:01:35] mind but because this is what the
[1:01:37] prophet says it was still in his
[1:01:41] heart that's why he went and
[1:01:45] asked is that right that's why brother B
[1:01:48] says oh be careful for the what the
[1:01:50] desires of your heart is he said because
[1:01:52] God will give you the desires of your
[1:01:54] heart and that's why he'll refer him
[1:01:56] back in in uh in uh choosing of a bride
[1:01:59] and you know brother B will say you say
[1:02:02] oh like that of a sister oh God called
[1:02:05] me to preach God told me to preach
[1:02:07] brother Ram said I don't say that he
[1:02:09] didn't he said but have you heard my
[1:02:11] message on balum balum got the clear-cut
[1:02:15] answer from God but he still wanted to
[1:02:18] do what he wanted to do so good so
[1:02:22] sometimes this is why when somebody said
[1:02:23] God told me to do something I don't
[1:02:25] doubt that I'm not down and say well God
[1:02:28] didn't tell you to do it because of this
[1:02:29] no you ought to understand is that
[1:02:31] sometimes God just says go ahead and do
[1:02:34] what you're going to
[1:02:36] do oh
[1:02:39] my I want to do what he wants me to do I
[1:02:43] I want to do according to the word I
[1:02:44] want everything I want I want my whole
[1:02:46] life not just not just a gift and as a
[1:02:49] minister and as a pastor but as a
[1:02:50] husband as a father as a brother I want
[1:02:53] it all under the word of God that that's
[1:02:55] my heart's desire I want it all there
[1:02:57] now notice with this gift of faith under
[1:03:00] the wisdom of God I want you just to
[1:03:02] catch this just for a moment of God's
[1:03:04] wisdom remember wisdom being uh the best
[1:03:08] gift of all and the wisdom of God in
[1:03:11] this hour coming down through the
[1:03:13] ministry of Malachi 4 to put these in
[1:03:15] perspective or into their place brother
[1:03:18] bram's going to pick up on this Bulldog
[1:03:20] faith that he just spoke about because
[1:03:22] remember when you talk about that
[1:03:23] Bulldog faith that or Roberts had uh
[1:03:26] Jack Cole and and you know and how that
[1:03:28] those men were so gifted within that way
[1:03:31] you know what they would be ministering
[1:03:33] and preaching you were not going to go
[1:03:34] to their services and hear Doctrine so
[1:03:38] much being ministered but what you were
[1:03:39] going to hear is is ministering on
[1:03:42] Divine Healing those that that's where a
[1:03:45] Allen all the rest of them that that's
[1:03:48] where they were focused around even
[1:03:50] within that time so they would be
[1:03:52] preaching the principles and the
[1:03:54] promises of God listen friends let me
[1:03:57] just say it to you like this the the
[1:03:59] principles and Promises of God are not
[1:04:02] exclusive to the
[1:04:04] bride that of the Rapture of the token
[1:04:08] of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:10] the seal that's bride
[1:04:13] exclusive are you hearing me that that's
[1:04:15] not that's not to all that's bride
[1:04:18] exclusive it's a word that gets down and
[1:04:20] discerns and leads us into full
[1:04:24] relationship right
[1:04:26] so then with this this we understand
[1:04:29] with this wisdom of God that God would
[1:04:31] would send down brother BR says this now
[1:04:34] watch he says Oral Roberts has the gift
[1:04:36] of healing I do I do have a gift of
[1:04:39] healing like you ministers to bring the
[1:04:41] people up there and pray for them but
[1:04:43] that's just a faith that just Bulldog
[1:04:45] faith that takes a hold and things like
[1:04:47] that but sometimes you let things go by
[1:04:51] but this way it's prophetic gift that
[1:04:54] searches that soul
[1:04:56] now what brother R is dealing with
[1:04:58] sometimes you let things go by because
[1:05:00] he said that with a Faith remember
[1:05:02] brother R say it over and over he said
[1:05:05] gifts themselves people can get
[1:05:07] themselves in trouble with
[1:05:09] gifts this is why that with that of
[1:05:12] faith that you say brother Samuel could
[1:05:14] a person's Faith be built to a place and
[1:05:17] there be things even wrong in their life
[1:05:20] it could be by the atmosphere they're
[1:05:22] around the prophet tells us that what
[1:05:25] place in New York where when you had
[1:05:28] those that were coming around and coming
[1:05:30] through the prayer line blind eyes were
[1:05:32] healed ears were ears were open and they
[1:05:34] walked off the platform and within a day
[1:05:36] or two they were blind again deaf again
[1:05:38] and the prophet said what happened was
[1:05:40] in the presence of the Angel of the Lord
[1:05:43] it took it off but because they weren't
[1:05:45] sincere down in the bottom of their
[1:05:47] heart having hiding things and
[1:05:49] unconfessed sin it came right back why
[1:05:52] it was an invitation for that Spirit to
[1:05:55] return right this is why the prophet
[1:05:57] said the Lord the angel of the Lord
[1:05:59] instructed him you make those people
[1:06:02] repent before they come up there you see
[1:06:05] friends let me just tell you something
[1:06:07] it the greatest thing uh in our lives
[1:06:10] that is the greatest blessing in our
[1:06:12] lives yes we're going to be times we
[1:06:14] need healing but you know what a
[1:06:15] blessing it is to be able to live free
[1:06:18] and clear where there's nothing you've
[1:06:20] got to try to bury in the backyard or
[1:06:22] hide or keep away you know it don't do
[1:06:24] no good you might hide from me you might
[1:06:27] hide from anybody else but let me just
[1:06:29] tell you something there's an all C and
[1:06:31] I that's watching you and the word
[1:06:33] itself is alive it's a discerner of the
[1:06:36] thoughts and intents of the heart and
[1:06:38] when the word comes to deal with our
[1:06:40] lives he's not here to shame us that
[1:06:42] pullback sometimes is because the enemy
[1:06:44] is getting exposed because of the hold
[1:06:47] that he might have in our life but God
[1:06:50] is wanting to cut us free because we are
[1:06:53] people real true son of Liberty we are
[1:06:57] those that were ordained by the blood of
[1:07:00] Jesus Christ because the purchase has
[1:07:02] already been made we we should not be
[1:07:04] held down and subject to anything and
[1:07:06] this is why the wings of Jehovah Eagle
[1:07:10] sweeps over the congregation and
[1:07:12] ministers to our life to let us know
[1:07:15] you're free amen you're free all it
[1:07:18] simply takes is a confession and that'll
[1:07:22] back the devil right up
[1:07:24] amen Hallelujah this is what brother B
[1:07:27] is talking about he said what if they
[1:07:29] came up there and I through prayer and
[1:07:32] Faith take that sickness off of them or
[1:07:34] that disease that God allowed to be put
[1:07:38] on them for
[1:07:39] correction that I'm in trouble he said
[1:07:42] I'm in trouble you see what wisdom did
[1:07:45] with the gift of faith it brought the
[1:07:47] intelligence of God down it brings the
[1:07:51] wisdom of God about these things not
[1:07:53] just walking out and saying well I'm
[1:07:54] going to do this and I'll do this and no
[1:07:56] no remember Faith fa gift of faith is
[1:07:59] get yourself out of the way it's not
[1:08:01] about what we want to do so then you
[1:08:04] know brother Bram said you know there's
[1:08:06] all these things you know he talking
[1:08:08] about that super duper faith and he says
[1:08:10] you know remember I talked to you about
[1:08:11] the angel of the Lord taking things off
[1:08:13] of people and brother B says you know
[1:08:15] these men he said sometimes he's talking
[1:08:18] about men with gift of faith and things
[1:08:20] he said God doesn't have no such things
[1:08:22] as that no super duper healing super
[1:08:24] duper faith super you know what that is
[1:08:26] that's billboard
[1:08:28] attraction God has never been inter I'll
[1:08:30] tell you what God won't share his glory
[1:08:32] with no
[1:08:33] man a man starts to get lifted up a
[1:08:36] little bit that's it it's on the way out
[1:08:38] the door God will move on it doesn't
[1:08:39] mean that that man or that individual is
[1:08:41] lost but you know what God can only use
[1:08:43] us as we are available to be
[1:08:47] used and so he said God don't have no
[1:08:49] such things as that they bring people to
[1:08:51] the platforms many times and gifted men
[1:08:54] no doubt but with a misunderstanding of
[1:08:56] the Gospel they'll P oil on them pray
[1:08:59] stand there shake them until something
[1:09:01] happens and they get healed and maybe
[1:09:03] that person living in sin and go right
[1:09:05] back out and find it comes right back on
[1:09:07] them again and maybe they was under an
[1:09:09] excitement at that time you hear what he
[1:09:11] said maybe they was under an excitement
[1:09:13] at that time and and with which the
[1:09:16] faith of God that they accumulated did
[1:09:19] heal them but when they get off among
[1:09:21] unbelievers it comes right back
[1:09:23] again so you see this why you know
[1:09:26] because you see how Satan's trick with
[1:09:29] this if he can keep things hidden and
[1:09:31] that things aren't really clear wherein
[1:09:33] that the blessings of God will be
[1:09:35] retained in our life by real clear Faith
[1:09:39] then Satan will turn around to an
[1:09:40] individual and say see there ain't
[1:09:42] nothing to you you must not be a
[1:09:44] believer look at you oh by the way you
[1:09:48] know brother Brandon says this an
[1:09:49] adoption part too if you've got
[1:09:51] something in your life you can't rest
[1:09:53] until you make it right right away and
[1:09:54] what is this two weeks month down the
[1:09:57] road and you're still hanging on you got
[1:09:59] to watch Satan is working to try to run
[1:10:02] things down and run you right in the
[1:10:05] ground but this is where faith on the
[1:10:08] inside will not take no for an answer
[1:10:10] because what you cannot deny you cannot
[1:10:13] deny what God has done in your
[1:10:17] life and let me tell you something no
[1:10:19] more than a Roman seal could keep him
[1:10:21] locked in a tomb no more than any form
[1:10:24] of UN believe or anything is going to
[1:10:27] take the holy spirit away from your life
[1:10:29] you can grieve it but remember very
[1:10:32] simple for it to return become a lamb
[1:10:34] again amen become a
[1:10:36] lamb amen so when we look at this Gifts
[1:10:40] of healing and brother bam said it's not
[1:10:43] gift of healing it's gifts plural he
[1:10:46] said because it's God working in a many
[1:10:50] many many many uh not a Min membered but
[1:10:53] a many faceted way a different ways he
[1:10:56] said God will work through the preacher
[1:10:58] to build your faith he said God might
[1:11:00] just move upon your neighbor sitting
[1:11:02] next to you God can move upon this one
[1:11:04] he said this is why it's Gifts of
[1:11:07] healing it's not just something that's
[1:11:09] confined it's God operating through the
[1:11:11] body in many different
[1:11:15] ways so here the scripture said to
[1:11:18] another Gifts of healing by The Same
[1:11:22] Spirit brother BR says a gift of healing
[1:11:26] it's not a gift of Miracles though many
[1:11:28] miracles are performed right along with
[1:11:30] it but it's a gift of healing the people
[1:11:34] get well they go out prayed for they
[1:11:37] come back and they're healed wait till I
[1:11:39] leave the city friends after I'm gone a
[1:11:41] long time you'll hear the people coming
[1:11:43] to your churches saying Cancer's gone my
[1:11:47] deafness I had I hear now my Affliction
[1:11:50] it just left me and he goes on he says
[1:11:52] the gift of healing which is not a gift
[1:11:56] of Miracles it's a gift of healing now
[1:12:00] can God move down and miraculously right
[1:12:03] then and there absolutely brother BR
[1:12:05] said I've prayed for him and seen the
[1:12:07] cancers right there turn red black and
[1:12:09] fall off right on the platform but he
[1:12:12] said then you have that where it it can
[1:12:14] come and it'll speak directly to the
[1:12:16] life and it speaks to the life to curse
[1:12:19] the life remember what Jesus did when he
[1:12:21] saw that tree with leaves and he cursed
[1:12:24] he cursed that tree no man eat fruit
[1:12:26] from thee any longer he spoke to the
[1:12:28] life and the Bible said it dried from
[1:12:31] The Roots up and this is why there's the
[1:12:35] difference within that of Miracles and
[1:12:38] Divine Healing is there miracles in
[1:12:40] Divine Healing yes but Miracles are
[1:12:43] things listen it's all miraculous but I
[1:12:45] think you understand when we talk about
[1:12:47] miracles talking about things taking
[1:12:50] place right then and there but Divine
[1:12:52] Healing is where the Cure itself has
[1:12:56] come down into our life and it begins to
[1:12:58] move in our life just exactly like that
[1:13:01] one who returned back to the you know
[1:13:03] turned back there in home uh there in
[1:13:06] Canaan and his servants met him and he
[1:13:08] said hey hey hey hey you're you're the
[1:13:10] one that you the one that was sick he
[1:13:13] he's well and he asked him what hour did
[1:13:16] he begin to
[1:13:22] amend healing
[1:13:26] healing is a wonderful
[1:13:29] thing and let me just say this in this
[1:13:33] way it's not it's not it's all God's
[1:13:37] sovereignty as to how it all takes
[1:13:40] place that that in itself is one thing
[1:13:43] that should really you know just just
[1:13:46] put everything there at rest because
[1:13:47] it's just simply the faith in God that
[1:13:50] has been built and however it's going to
[1:13:53] take place when it drops in our heart
[1:13:55] hands are laid on or you know whatever
[1:13:58] it's going to take place whether it's a
[1:14:00] miracle right then or a miracle down the
[1:14:03] line it's all going to be of God is that
[1:14:07] right now notice brother BR says when
[1:14:09] these sick people pass by remember
[1:14:12] they'll get well you just go believe and
[1:14:14] if you come by your faith notice your
[1:14:17] faith will reach in and take a hold of
[1:14:20] that gift of healing and you'll be
[1:14:22] healed now notice when he says it'll
[1:14:24] reach in and take a hold of that gift of
[1:14:27] healing what is it it will take a hold
[1:14:29] of that faith in the finished work of
[1:14:33] God and bring it right down personal
[1:14:36] that it was he bore those stripes for me
[1:14:40] amen it's where it becomes
[1:14:43] personal oh my hallelujah oh man I just
[1:14:47] I can't wait till I get on down some of
[1:14:48] the other
[1:14:49] slides brother BR says a gift of healing
[1:14:52] doesn't mean that man heals somebody
[1:14:55] right it means a man that's got faith in
[1:14:58] Divine Healing that can point them to
[1:15:02] the finished work of Jesus Christ at
[1:15:05] Calvary so it isn't the man oh this this
[1:15:08] man's A Healer no that's that's not true
[1:15:10] it's not true at all it's not the man
[1:15:12] himself it's not anything of that of the
[1:15:15] man it means a man that has faith in
[1:15:19] Divine Healing now brother BR would talk
[1:15:22] about that you know even you know as he
[1:15:24] would uh deal with this and he would
[1:15:26] speak about how that you remember Tommy
[1:15:28] Osborne came running up to brother
[1:15:30] brandham after he saw that Maniac you
[1:15:32] know pin you know brother bram's feet
[1:15:35] into the ground and you know he he Tommy
[1:15:38] Osborne came running to brother Bram you
[1:15:40] know he came down there to his house and
[1:15:43] and he came down to and he said you know
[1:15:46] I I you know I want you to pray you know
[1:15:47] do you thinkk God that I'll have a gift
[1:15:49] of healing and and and so forth do you
[1:15:52] do you think I'll do that brother Bram
[1:15:53] tells him he said now Tommy he said you
[1:15:55] got to get started off on the right
[1:15:57] right foot because you can make a lot of
[1:15:59] noise and anything and people will
[1:16:00] follow you but remember your ministry
[1:16:03] said you're going to answer for it
[1:16:05] someday now he says he said you see that
[1:16:07] old oak tree sitting up there on the
[1:16:10] porch he said brother Bosworth I was
[1:16:12] standing right there on in front of that
[1:16:14] house down there where brother Bosworth
[1:16:16] sat and brother Bram had that little
[1:16:17] shotgun house and brother brother
[1:16:19] Bosworth you know he says you you go
[1:16:21] crawl up under that oak tree who knows
[1:16:24] about Divine Healing crawl up under that
[1:16:26] oak tree and talk to him a while he said
[1:16:29] now if you've been called with a gift
[1:16:31] you'd have known about it way back
[1:16:32] Yonder he said now he said now look Tomy
[1:16:35] he said every preacher general orders
[1:16:37] are to pray for the sick and he says it
[1:16:39] like this every Christian in here has
[1:16:42] just as much right to pray for the sick
[1:16:44] as I do he said now the only thing to do
[1:16:48] is preach the word so clear that you'd
[1:16:51] see it and accept it and there's nothing
[1:16:53] in the man that would he nothing in his
[1:16:55] prayer that would heal it's your faith
[1:16:58] brother Brown says now he said Tommy
[1:17:01] went up there and got with brother
[1:17:02] Bosworth I want you this will be
[1:17:04] important as I'm coming down he got with
[1:17:06] brother Bosworth and stayed with him
[1:17:08] about a year or so he said and and until
[1:17:10] he found all the techniques of how to
[1:17:13] use the
[1:17:14] scriptures if you ever read the book uh
[1:17:17] brother Bram the one he talked about
[1:17:19] remember he said said he was in that
[1:17:20] self-pity complex of that and he said
[1:17:23] until I heard the eagle scream when I
[1:17:24] read a book by FF Bosworth called
[1:17:27] healing thoughts you can buy it on
[1:17:28] Amazon for5 or $6 healing thoughts
[1:17:31] because when you go to reading it you'll
[1:17:32] be like I heard brother Ram say this I
[1:17:34] heard brother Ram say this and I heard
[1:17:35] brother Ram say this I heard you you'll
[1:17:37] be hearing quotes and things about
[1:17:38] confession because what one thing that
[1:17:40] brother Bosworth stood upon is is he
[1:17:43] said once we have been prayed for then
[1:17:45] begin to fill your life with every
[1:17:48] promise of God when you've been prayed
[1:17:50] for healing feel your life continually
[1:17:53] day by day sat at it with the promises
[1:17:56] of God confessing it meditating on it
[1:17:59] sounds like a multitude of quotes don't
[1:18:01] it it's true it's true yeah Thou shalt
[1:18:05] make thy way good and prosperous but you
[1:18:07] see building faith by the word of God
[1:18:09] now notice this gifts the gifts of faith
[1:18:13] and and we when we're looking at it here
[1:18:15] and noticing it that you know it's it's
[1:18:18] seeing in the word where brother Bram
[1:18:20] says if if you want to know how to get
[1:18:22] healed now you know when brother Bram
[1:18:24] speak in this KN and wanting how to get
[1:18:26] healed if someone would say there's
[1:18:27] somebody in town that's got a gift of
[1:18:30] healing now that doesn't mean that that
[1:18:32] person by this gift of healing can heal
[1:18:34] you it only means if you have faith in
[1:18:37] healing and from knowing it by the word
[1:18:40] of God because healing has already been
[1:18:45] appropriated amen he was already his
[1:18:48] stripes he already bore them I don't
[1:18:50] care what virus whatever more comes out
[1:18:53] of whatever lab or whatever anything I
[1:18:55] don't care the Bible said I'm the Lord
[1:18:58] that Health
[1:19:00] all Hallelujah and when fear wants to
[1:19:03] come around stick it right back in the
[1:19:05] devil's face I'm the Lord that Health
[1:19:07] all thine diseases hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:11] all the way through the scriptures God
[1:19:13] has laid out his pring provision for
[1:19:16] healing in our lives I think that's so
[1:19:18] powerful because what brother bandam is
[1:19:20] is talking about in this quote is how
[1:19:23] that he says of that healing healing
[1:19:25] itself it's got to be based from the
[1:19:27] Bible and and it shows God's attitude is
[1:19:30] the same about healing it's the same all
[1:19:33] along now listen there's been vultures
[1:19:35] that wanted to come down in the evening
[1:19:37] time vultures that Abraham when that
[1:19:41] sacrifice was laid there those vultures
[1:19:44] wanted to come and pick away at the
[1:19:47] sacrifice but the prophet said Abraham
[1:19:49] stood up you know what I'm talking about
[1:19:51] Genesis 15 he shed away those vultures
[1:19:54] vultures that was wanting to take away
[1:19:57] Divine Healing was wanting to take away
[1:19:59] the reality of God out of the Church of
[1:20:02] the Living God I'm glad that there's
[1:20:04] Eagles of God that can run back the
[1:20:06] vultures and say you can't have one part
[1:20:09] of the body It All Belongs to
[1:20:13] Me amen amen and amen hallelujah he said
[1:20:17] I want to show you I want to show you
[1:20:20] how how that you know the appropriate
[1:20:22] praying and how you can get healed
[1:20:25] now this here it's all it's it's by
[1:20:29] divine
[1:20:30] inspiration it's by divine inspiration
[1:20:33] of how God would so work and to bring
[1:20:37] that our eyes would become open to the
[1:20:40] promise of God for what God has for us
[1:20:42] remember when Jesus sent the 12
[1:20:45] disciples Judas was among them he gave
[1:20:48] them power and authority over all Devils
[1:20:50] this is for they ever had the Holy Ghost
[1:20:52] and to cure diseases now they themselves
[1:20:55] could not cure the diseases but they
[1:20:57] were under an administration of
[1:21:00] authority that had been granted to them
[1:21:03] even though the atonement had not come
[1:21:05] yet because healing has always been
[1:21:09] remember Judas was right in the midst of
[1:21:11] all this is that right remember brother
[1:21:13] Bram said Judas had a Ministry that was
[1:21:15] second to
[1:21:16] nine he sent now he sent and told them
[1:21:19] to preach the kingdom and to heal the
[1:21:20] sick and they departed and went through
[1:21:23] the towns preaching the go El and
[1:21:25] healing everywhere now you see all of
[1:21:28] that just like what I mentioned about
[1:21:29] Judas Satan likes to take things and try
[1:21:32] to throw off on it well I'll tell you
[1:21:34] what you know I've seen a lot of
[1:21:36] false you've heard this over and over
[1:21:38] you've heard preacher after preacher say
[1:21:39] it the reality of it is I I don't think
[1:21:42] anybody in here if you're offered a $100
[1:21:44] bill are going to say nope i' I've got
[1:21:46] too many I've had too many phony if
[1:21:49] you've had even phony ones you've been
[1:21:52] blessed you understand
[1:21:55] but you see how the devil would he wants
[1:21:57] to try to minimize things and and
[1:21:59] through that of well I know Judas and I
[1:22:01] know this let me tell you something
[1:22:03] God's got true
[1:22:06] gifts because God's word is true amen
[1:22:09] and you be like that old groundhog that
[1:22:11] when he looked up there and brother BR
[1:22:13] said he saw that old sorry thing that I
[1:22:15] made for a scarecrow he looked at that
[1:22:17] and went right around behind and kept on
[1:22:19] eating butter
[1:22:20] beans sometimes you've got to walk past
[1:22:23] scarecrows amen and recognize how do I
[1:22:26] know it's a scarecrow if it's anything
[1:22:29] that tries to rise up and keep you from
[1:22:32] anything that God has promised it's a
[1:22:37] scarecrow now brother B says this in
[1:22:40] looking for Jesus you know what he's
[1:22:43] talking about how that within this of
[1:22:46] how that the the minister will begin to
[1:22:49] speak by inspiration and brother BR says
[1:22:51] he goes in he says now the minister he
[1:22:53] he gets ins spiration he's got a gift of
[1:22:56] healing gift of healing course is Faith
[1:22:59] in healing you can kind of see how faith
[1:23:01] and that Gifts of healing work he
[1:23:03] believes it with all his heart he stands
[1:23:06] up and he preaches it with great
[1:23:08] forceful words that goes out to the
[1:23:11] people and they just have to believe it
[1:23:13] it just presents it in such a way till
[1:23:16] you just have to believe it how many of
[1:23:19] you said in meetings like that sometimes
[1:23:22] some of our regular Services how God
[1:23:24] will take something but we've sat right
[1:23:25] here even when God will bring in
[1:23:27] evangelists or maybe it's another Pastor
[1:23:29] or you've been in another meeting and
[1:23:31] all of a sudden it just takes and takes
[1:23:33] a place in such a place like that that
[1:23:35] you're in a part to say you know what
[1:23:37] I'm not walking out of here with this in
[1:23:39] my life what's happened your faith is
[1:23:43] being built by the inspiration of God
[1:23:46] that has inspired that man and it's
[1:23:49] causing you to see beyond your condition
[1:23:52] and see it's already finished that's
[1:23:54] good that's good brother BR says now
[1:23:57] brother Roberts he's very good at that a
[1:24:00] brother brother Osborne a man who can
[1:24:02] tie Satan in so many places in the
[1:24:04] scripture till he hasn't even got a
[1:24:06] place to move he's just tied up he does
[1:24:09] that not by knowledge they do it by
[1:24:12] inspiration and the Holy Spirit give
[1:24:15] them a gift of Divine Healing which
[1:24:19] gives inspiration to the people when
[1:24:23] they see the word of God is claiming
[1:24:26] what they're talking about so it opens
[1:24:30] our eyes of understanding it begins to
[1:24:33] open within that moment what is that it
[1:24:36] is a gift one a gift of healing that can
[1:24:39] move right down remember Gifts of
[1:24:42] healing it can be in many manner brother
[1:24:44] BR says it'll come many times through
[1:24:46] maybe a master teacher though he said
[1:24:48] they're Master explainers of the word
[1:24:51] And he as I just read to you right here
[1:24:53] they can tie they can tie Satan in so
[1:24:55] many places and he wants to escape there
[1:24:57] and they tie him up right there brother
[1:24:59] R says in another place that man begins
[1:25:01] to let loose he says he Corners the
[1:25:04] devil all over the place what is that a
[1:25:07] gift of healing coming through the
[1:25:10] ministering of the word and then after
[1:25:13] that hands will be laid on committal how
[1:25:17] they feel led to do it sometimes it's
[1:25:19] with hands right sometimes it stand up
[1:25:22] hands laid on one another sometimes it
[1:25:24] stand it's just stand up it's over you
[1:25:27] just you just sense it it's over it's
[1:25:29] it's dropped now it may not have dropped
[1:25:31] for everybody maybe someone who needs
[1:25:33] help but you know what if I if I just
[1:25:35] need a little bit of reassurance I'm not
[1:25:38] ashamed brother Samuel you've been
[1:25:40] you've been serving the lord for how
[1:25:42] many years well I don't know that you
[1:25:44] got a badge to where you don't ever have
[1:25:45] to come forward for
[1:25:47] prayer I do know a badge called Pride I
[1:25:50] don't want
[1:25:51] that that you know well I just speak the
[1:25:53] word and just you know this is once
[1:25:55] again we don't want to allow the things
[1:25:58] to where the enemy puts us in a corner
[1:26:00] and we don't got to pretend to be
[1:26:02] nothing we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:05] we've got a right to every promise of
[1:26:07] God how dare the vultures of the enemy
[1:26:10] minimize any promise of God we still
[1:26:13] believe in laying hands on the sick and
[1:26:15] they shall recover we believe there is
[1:26:18] the prayer of faith that'll back the
[1:26:20] devil up we believe that that the Holy
[1:26:23] Ghost is just is real you can receive it
[1:26:26] while the word's going forth they can
[1:26:27] lay hands on you and you receive it God
[1:26:30] is still the god of his
[1:26:33] word every word is just as
[1:26:37] inspired glory be to God that
[1:26:40] inspiration strikes let me tell you
[1:26:42] what's happening there when inspiration
[1:26:44] strikes you like that brother BR says
[1:26:46] confess he says when the inspiration of
[1:26:49] the holy spirit is there to inspire you
[1:26:53] you confess what he's saying you know
[1:26:56] what's happening it's like a temporary
[1:27:00] Rapture that's what happened to the
[1:27:02] prophets when they would get caught up
[1:27:05] and they would see things so
[1:27:07] clear this is what happens to you when
[1:27:10] the inspiration the channel of
[1:27:13] inspiration begins to build whether it's
[1:27:15] for healing it doesn't matter stepping
[1:27:17] into that channel of inspiration you
[1:27:19] begin to see things oh brother Braham
[1:27:22] said oh he said I've seen he said people
[1:27:25] sit there glum and everything else he
[1:27:27] said all of a sudden something he said
[1:27:30] will cut loose way up here and it'll
[1:27:32] start rolling down rolling down rolling
[1:27:34] down and he said it rolls down and it
[1:27:36] strikes that individual he said where
[1:27:38] they sat with a frown all of a sudden it
[1:27:40] becomes a smile he said they they just
[1:27:42] receive you know just like a strength
[1:27:44] and and ready to move on he said what is
[1:27:45] that that's Revelation dropping from The
[1:27:49] Unseen realm glory be to God do you
[1:27:52] realize the prophet said in Revelation
[1:27:54] book of symbols when you have been
[1:27:57] baptized with the Holy Ghost and become
[1:27:59] born again you have now become a
[1:28:03] candidate to have an association with
[1:28:05] the angels the supernatural almighty God
[1:28:09] hallah because remember bringing you and
[1:28:12] I
[1:28:14] messages those who are The Heirs of
[1:28:17] Salvation glory be to
[1:28:19] God
[1:28:21] hallelujah oh I'm glad GL I not only
[1:28:24] have a passport where we've got the Visa
[1:28:27] cuz you can have a passport and not get
[1:28:28] into a country that almost happened to
[1:28:30] me in Ghana the one time first time I
[1:28:32] went it was about a week and a half
[1:28:34] before I had to go and realized I had to
[1:28:36] have a right before I flew to Australia
[1:28:38] it wasn't some Visa it was some you know
[1:28:40] some some sort of thing I had to have I
[1:28:42] didn't realize it all of a sudden I
[1:28:44] realized I text brother Nathan text
[1:28:45] Brother Ronnie said Hey cuz they had
[1:28:47] went there the year ahead of me I said
[1:28:48] hey do I got to get to have anything
[1:28:50] else now it reminds you I'm only a few
[1:28:52] days from step on an
[1:28:55] airplane I thought dear
[1:28:57] Lord here I've done it again I mean who
[1:28:59] would have thought you know I didn't
[1:29:01] need a visa to go into the Philippines
[1:29:03] but you see what happened is is that I
[1:29:05] needed to have that Visa along with the
[1:29:07] passport because you know what the Visa
[1:29:09] is it's your
[1:29:11] token the passport is believing on him
[1:29:15] but the Visa comes from being in
[1:29:19] him that's not my words that's the
[1:29:21] prophet's words you've got to have that
[1:29:23] Visa which is the
[1:29:25] token God helped me to always be
[1:29:27] sensitive to that cuz the Lord knows I
[1:29:31] could have showed up over there and they
[1:29:32] could have just been interrogating me
[1:29:34] for a long time but you see the gifts of
[1:29:37] healing what it is its faith is Rising
[1:29:41] by seeing it through the word of God and
[1:29:44] brother B is talking about how that he
[1:29:46] says you know a man can preach the word
[1:29:48] of God so simple that a child could
[1:29:51] understand it and the people say well
[1:29:53] that's right then he's cornering the
[1:29:56] devil and the first thing you know the
[1:29:59] person says oh I believe it oh I believe
[1:30:01] it's from me and they accept it that
[1:30:03] settles it they go on testifying of it
[1:30:06] and they get
[1:30:08] well brother B say now some people has
[1:30:11] gifts like a real good preacher he can
[1:30:13] take that word of God lay it out there
[1:30:14] like some good Theologian that's the
[1:30:16] gift of healing they can make you see it
[1:30:20] through the word but it isn't the man
[1:30:23] cuz we can say here and talk all the
[1:30:25] time it isn't the man oh he has such an
[1:30:27] ability to be able to explain everything
[1:30:29] what did he say I don't know but I know
[1:30:31] it was deep right that's not what we're
[1:30:34] talking
[1:30:35] about that that's not what listen even
[1:30:38] with all the doctrines what's been
[1:30:39] restored to us was not to make us ooh
[1:30:42] and a and oh that's so deep did you see
[1:30:46] how that chart was laid out I'm not
[1:30:48] against charts I'm not against things
[1:30:49] being drawn out but you know what it's
[1:30:51] got to come down to where it'll walk in
[1:30:53] shoe leather we can't just look at the
[1:30:55] horse riders out here and say oh that's
[1:30:57] an antichrist Spirit oh I see the next
[1:30:59] one coming in and want to take power and
[1:31:01] then I see the next one coming in death
[1:31:03] then I see that next one just a mixture
[1:31:05] of everything just letting all down it's
[1:31:07] not just staying out there in Doctrine
[1:31:09] it's got to come down to discern it how
[1:31:11] it wants to make a ride in our own lives
[1:31:15] how he wants to ride right through the
[1:31:16] Bride of Jesus Christ he would love to
[1:31:19] come in such a simple way and when he
[1:31:21] gets in through a simple way then it
[1:31:24] begins to take
[1:31:26] power then death sets in we become
[1:31:30] deadened and the result of deadening is
[1:31:33] where we become
[1:31:36] mixture becomes pale
[1:31:39] grizzled oh my this is why we need the
[1:31:42] Discerning of the Holy Spirit notice the
[1:31:45] scripture would tell us here I'm I'm
[1:31:46] trying to get down brother Bram you know
[1:31:48] he would take that in the scripture of
[1:31:52] how that where it says it came to pass
[1:31:54] on a certain day as he was teaching the
[1:31:57] Lord Jesus there the Pharisees and
[1:31:59] doctors of the law were sitting by which
[1:32:02] were come out of every town of Galilee
[1:32:03] and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of
[1:32:06] the Lord was present to heal
[1:32:11] them now let me just try to bring this
[1:32:14] down here tonight we'll just kind of
[1:32:16] pause here brother brandham he steps
[1:32:20] forward and he is going to preach on
[1:32:23] he's been dealing with the Hebrew series
[1:32:25] and he wants to he's going to preach
[1:32:27] that morning on mzc great king and and
[1:32:30] priest Prince and he comes he's ready to
[1:32:33] go brother Bram tells us he's ready to
[1:32:35] go in the back office and he starts
[1:32:37] Hearing in the back office all these
[1:32:40] requests this one's sick this one's sick
[1:32:43] this one's sick oh there's one here with
[1:32:46] a baby that's sick brother BR said I
[1:32:48] just begin to hear all of these requests
[1:32:50] for different ones for healing and he
[1:32:53] said says after hearing these and
[1:32:55] requests for prayer I thought I'd just
[1:32:58] change it now where did he get the
[1:33:00] prompt to change it because at the end
[1:33:03] of this quote I'm referring to he said
[1:33:05] see I just had to be submissive to the
[1:33:08] Holy Spirit has he changed it for the
[1:33:11] purpose of what the needs that were
[1:33:14] present for healing and the spirit of
[1:33:18] God would so take the prophet of God and
[1:33:21] begin to minister on that of Divine
[1:33:24] Healing the promises of God aren't you
[1:33:26] glad that God ministers right to what we
[1:33:29] have need of he ministers to WR where we
[1:33:32] have need of as a matter of fact brother
[1:33:34] bam goes on to tell us within things of
[1:33:36] how that even when it would come like he
[1:33:38] would talk about with brother Bosworth
[1:33:40] you know brother Bosworth when you you
[1:33:42] ever listen to brother Bosworth you know
[1:33:44] because you would think you know like
[1:33:46] when you when you hear uh brother Oral
[1:33:48] Roberts brother Jack Cole if you ever
[1:33:51] hear them there's YouTube videos on them
[1:33:53] and uh and ministering and you'd hear
[1:33:55] them like brother Ram said they're
[1:33:56] forceful guys but when you would with
[1:33:59] brother FF Bosworth brother Bram would
[1:34:02] talk about how he said he was a teacher
[1:34:05] he said he you know he may not be able
[1:34:07] to preach like Paul but his his Focus
[1:34:10] was to try to catch the heart of the
[1:34:13] people and so brother brother Bosworth
[1:34:16] he says now maybe while somebody else
[1:34:18] he's comparing he said now maybe while
[1:34:19] somebody else is given a forceful
[1:34:21] message setting way
[1:34:24] back in the room and someone's enjoying
[1:34:26] that but there's a poor man dying with
[1:34:29] cancer and he don't care about a
[1:34:31] forceful message he wants to know some
[1:34:34] way out of the trouble that's good he's
[1:34:37] in that's good but's not knocking a
[1:34:40] forceful message he's just if one thing
[1:34:43] of all if we can draw out of this it's
[1:34:45] not about how much the minister sweats
[1:34:48] it's not how much they move it isn't
[1:34:51] even how much if they stand cuz most of
[1:34:54] Jesus preaching he was sitting that's
[1:34:56] right so this is why brother Bram says
[1:34:59] it shows us he said I really don't think
[1:35:01] we know what anointing is he said
[1:35:03] anointing is knowing how and
[1:35:07] when so good that's what a real
[1:35:09] anointing is so what what is that of
[1:35:12] real anointing is to wear that it would
[1:35:14] come upon the word and our eyes begin to
[1:35:17] see that finished work for whatever it
[1:35:20] is we have need of whether it's healing
[1:35:22] Deliverance whether whe it's the Holy
[1:35:24] Ghost whatever it is that you have need
[1:35:26] of it's that God would so appropriate
[1:35:29] what is needed the Lord anoint my eyes
[1:35:32] anoint my eyes of faith that I can see
[1:35:35] it's
[1:35:36] finished it's finished whether I receive
[1:35:39] the results right now or not just a word
[1:35:43] from you and when I've received that
[1:35:45] word from you that's a revelation and
[1:35:48] the gates of hell can Prevail against
[1:35:50] him do you love him amen amen I just so
[1:35:55] appreciate the Lord now let me just let
[1:35:57] me just give you this one little one
[1:35:59] little thing right
[1:36:01] here let me just give you one one little
[1:36:03] one little token before you leave I told
[1:36:06] you I was going to quit and I am I just
[1:36:08] want to give you one little token
[1:36:12] here brother Bram is talking about this
[1:36:14] with Divine Healing and he says you know
[1:36:17] what you don't have to wait till a
[1:36:19] Divine Healing program comes to be
[1:36:23] healed
[1:36:24] as a matter of fact he said they ought
[1:36:25] to be a Divine Healing campaign in every
[1:36:30] church and he said God will move through
[1:36:33] any member of the body he said it's not
[1:36:35] restricted to ministers God can move
[1:36:38] right through a lay member brother B
[1:36:40] gives an example I'll read it to you
[1:36:41] next week of where his daughter three
[1:36:44] years old little Rebecca three years old
[1:36:48] she got a burden on her heart in seeing
[1:36:50] a certain need and she prayed for that
[1:36:54] need and God moved down and honored the
[1:36:58] faith and that individual was
[1:37:00] healed you see three-year-old
[1:37:03] individual it didn't take somebody who
[1:37:05] was great enough it just takes simple
[1:37:08] childlike Faith amen you love the Lord
[1:37:12] that's so good this is why sitting right
[1:37:14] here

[1:37:23] your prayers is just as good is that
[1:37:26] right they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:37:28] and they shall recover maybe you a't got
[1:37:30] nobody else around maybe you you'll call
[1:37:32] somebody else on the phone maybe there's
[1:37:34] been times where you just have to lay
[1:37:36] hands on yourself
[1:37:39] that's that's good you and many others
[1:37:42] that's done
[1:37:44] that they said and it says they shall
[1:37:46] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:37:48] recover these might be a part of this
[1:37:51] body but right now when I'm laying them
[1:37:53] on they are in commandment and authority
[1:37:56] to the general orders of the Church of
