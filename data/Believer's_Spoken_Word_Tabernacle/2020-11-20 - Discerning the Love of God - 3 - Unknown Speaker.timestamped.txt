[26:39] verse of scripture let you seat 1
[26:42] Corinthians
[26:44] 14 verse one
[27:04] just one verse of
[27:07] scripture Paul says
[27:10] follow after
[27:14] charity and desire spiritual gifts but
[27:19] rather that you may
[27:23] Pro notice the order once again follow
[27:27] after
[27:29] charot that word follow means pursue it
[27:35] seek after eagerly earnestly
[27:39] Endeavor require follow after charity
[27:43] and desire spiritual gifts rather
[27:49] that may God bless you
[27:53] BL I want to just kind of speak to you
[27:55] here just a moment before I get into
[27:57] preaching
[28:03] time um you know where
[28:06] everything most of
[28:09] you get any updates you know where
[28:11] things
[28:13] are virus out
[28:16] there um we thank God Mercy can't think
[28:24] enough
[28:26] God watched over us and no different
[28:28] ones in this assembly as
[28:31] had I just also appreciate touch of the
[28:35] Lord and how God has moved for the
[28:39] assembly because you
[28:40] know everything
[28:43] itself uh sometimes things can be
[28:46] thought to be a myth until it comes to
[28:48] your
[28:49] door and the thing of it is is what we
[28:52] we I think where we've we've had to be
[28:55] at and I'm just saying we as far as
[28:57] those are
[28:58] gathered here in this assembly whether
[29:00] over the Internet or here there's so
[29:02] many things that we you want to
[29:05] know certain grounds to stand upon you
[29:08] want to know certain approaches it's
[29:10] like when you go to the doctor you you
[29:12] don't want a doctor to really to mess
[29:14] around you want them to be
[29:15] straightforward you want them to tell
[29:16] you say hey we're going to start you on
[29:18] this medicine this medicine it may not
[29:20] work you come back they're able to be
[29:23] honest and say well you know um we
[29:25] should have maybe taken this course or
[29:27] that course
[29:28] and the unfortunate thing that we find
[29:32] ourselves even chartering through here
[29:35] um we do not find any any help
[29:39] whatsoever from even those that are
[29:42] around it you hear this hear that and we
[29:45] a lot of the things has been political
[29:48] dump actually had to kind of
[29:51] sort that's not anything you don't even
[29:53] have to be old you can be even even the
[29:56] the kids see it's just just things that
[29:59] if in this time if you didn't hate
[30:01] politics Will after this uh but it's
[30:04] just because the thing that should be is
[30:07] that it's said it's a real thing we're
[30:10] not fearful of it we know that God God
[30:13] knew this was going to be here God
[30:15] provided faith that was not just to
[30:17] address that but most importantly
[30:19] rapturing Faith this just happens to be
[30:22] one of the one of the one of the parts
[30:25] along the way and we have to kind of
[30:27] navigate through I want to just
[30:29] encourage you within it as a
[30:33] congregation we're going to get through
[30:35] this we're going to get
[30:37] through um anything else otherwise you
[30:40] keep it to yourself because I'm really
[30:42] not
[30:43] interested because you know and I'll
[30:45] just say it I don't mean to be I'm not
[30:49] saying things to be arrogant or
[30:50] sarcastic but I don't uh I look at
[30:53] things in the positive way that's way we
[30:55] should look I'm not looking looking at
[30:58] it with a pie in the sky I believe that
[31:00] we're going to get through this we're
[31:02] going to get back to the place to where
[31:04] and I long for it to where that we're
[31:06] able to hug
[31:08] one shake one another's hand to be able
[31:12] to have fellowships things like that not
[31:15] not to worry about that we listen in all
[31:18] of that right here this is where we also
[31:20] have to keep our Focus because a lot of
[31:22] these things come you know sometimes you
[31:25] get to thinking about it it can just
[31:28] because if you think about it in terms
[31:29] say will we ever get back to this will
[31:32] this ever happen you go to thinking on
[31:34] that right there that can really get you
[31:36] down that can get you down but you've
[31:39] got you have to look at it in the manner
[31:41] that look even God knew this would be
[31:45] here and God is seeing us through I tell
[31:48] you if if anything else at all it's one
[31:51] of those things that just don't be
[31:53] looking at updates and a lot of things
[31:56] but look but being in
[31:58] prayer be in prayer that God would this
[32:02] is a
[32:03] devil it's a demon that God would send
[32:06] this right back to
[32:09] Hell uh you know these are things that
[32:12] when we're when we're we're looking at
[32:14] it and that's what I'm praying for I
[32:17] believe that I'm I'm I know I know I'm
[32:19] standing on the word of God and brother
[32:21] brandom would even tell us he would say
[32:23] regarding cancer he said they would have
[32:25] already found a cure for cancer if we
[32:27] would have been more sincere in our
[32:31] prayers so it really challenges our
[32:33] heart you've seen how brother banam
[32:35] rejoiced when they came out with the
[32:36] polio vaccine I'm telling you these are
[32:39] things that I'm just saying from my
[32:40] heart I have thanked God for what he's
[32:42] done and keeping his hand upon us as an
[32:45] assembly and I will say this I thank you
[32:47] for that and I thank you I've said that
[32:49] many times I thank you that you haven't
[32:52] disregarded things when it's been out
[32:53] here and been in one another's face
[32:56] everything else it's hard on us that
[32:58] goes completely against the principle of
[33:01] the word of God of how that you know
[33:04] where to love one another and to you you
[33:06] it's just something about that that you
[33:08] just you love to be able to express that
[33:11] that love and that kinship it means
[33:13] something to be able to reach out and
[33:15] shake hands with somebody or to be able
[33:17] to hug them around the neck and say
[33:19] brother I love you or a sister to a
[33:21] sister God bless you Sister I just
[33:23] really appreciate you and these are
[33:26] things that you know that we will we
[33:30] will God will see us he's seeing us
[33:32] through this and he will see us through
[33:34] this our Focus within it our strength is
[33:37] looking to him through all of this and
[33:40] just just leaning and just trusting just
[33:42] trusting in Him things that I've really
[33:45] myself I've really looked at as as as a
[33:48] pastor and just trying to take a lot of
[33:51] inventory over things uh over the course
[33:55] of uh this whole thing
[33:58] and um the one thing that seems to be so
[34:02] prevalent that where things sometimes
[34:04] will spread out is when there are uh
[34:07] informal moments and yet that's not
[34:09] always a guarantee but what I mean
[34:11] informal moments where here we are here
[34:14] and we're we're pretty much we're
[34:16] separated you know and so forth and we
[34:18] we have been able by the grace of God
[34:21] within this building that we have here
[34:23] to be able to social distance and yet in
[34:26] many other cases you know a lot of times
[34:28] in Social
[34:29] Gatherings people just and it's just
[34:32] common and normal where people would go
[34:34] up to one another and you know they
[34:36] forget about everything and they're you
[34:38] know just the six foot is completely
[34:40] eliminated and everything else is going
[34:43] on you know and and the precautions
[34:45] still aren't taken and uh I'll just say
[34:48] it like this you know germs are
[34:51] everywhere germs everywhere so Samuel
[34:54] what are you saying I'm saying that
[34:55] every time I get a shopping cart I go
[34:57] grab one of them
[34:59] wipes am I afraid no I just don't want
[35:02] somebody's germes on that
[35:05] handle why why have them on there I mean
[35:08] it doesn't I'm I don't want to get sick
[35:10] I don't like I don't like stuff I don't
[35:13] and uh I've been sick you've been sick
[35:15] our trust is in the Lord don't you I
[35:18] trust you to be mature in this things
[35:20] that our trust is in the Lord is that
[35:23] right it's just like if if there's a a
[35:26] den of snakes I trust Lord but I ain't
[35:28] going to walk in a dent of snake right I
[35:31] mean you know these are things that God
[35:34] has showed us and even through the
[35:36] messages that even as we started in
[35:38] March and April God brought many things
[35:40] to us to show this uh in these things
[35:44] and you know I want to say this that
[35:46] we've we had some times here where
[35:48] there's been some kind of a sometimes
[35:50] here and it's not intentional I do not
[35:53] believe it's intentional where we've had
[35:54] some times where maybe things people
[35:56] have seated a little little closer or
[35:58] they' set a little closer and I don't
[35:59] believe that's been intentional at all
[36:02] sometimes you sit down and somebody's
[36:03] been at the bathroom and you don't even
[36:05] realize it but really for the most part
[36:07] when I look out across it I really I see
[36:10] that where we've been spaced and the
[36:12] distance and all that has been there and
[36:14] we're just trying to do everything that
[36:16] we can do there's been many churches
[36:19] that have had breakouts and different
[36:21] things in some instances where some of
[36:23] them they have no idea how in the world
[36:25] that that it even happened I'm grateful
[36:27] to God and what we've worked for is is I
[36:31] I want to stay
[36:33] open I want to stay open and I want to
[36:36] do all that we can and it's going to
[36:38] take it'll take a little bit more for us
[36:40] maybe during this time we're looking at
[36:42] through I think the middle of uh even
[36:45] December but I think you know as I told
[36:47] you before that means if if I had to
[36:50] come here to the house of God and wear a
[36:51] brown paper bag I want to be in the
[36:53] house of God I want to be here I I want
[36:57] to be gathered together with with the
[37:00] saints of God and and look whether I'm
[37:02] preaching or I'm not preaching preaching
[37:04] it's just something about being together
[37:06] with the children of God so if that's
[37:08] what we have to do we you know we have
[37:10] to do that so I want to encourage you uh
[37:13] to to wear to wear the mask I know
[37:15] sometimes that gets hard but I want to
[37:17] encourage you to do that I know some of
[37:19] you may not even be prepared you know
[37:22] and you've been coming in with and I I
[37:24] I've sat back there and I've watched it
[37:25] in Services you've came in with them and
[37:28] you've done exactly what's been done
[37:29] even at restaurants come in with them
[37:31] you've left and gone to the bathroom
[37:33] with them come back with them on and all
[37:35] that and I know there's some that can't
[37:37] it's Exempted from for health reasons
[37:39] and and please
[37:42] I I'm not even into the scientific part
[37:45] on this you understand I I'm not this or
[37:47] that I'm not even trying to sort that
[37:49] out I don't even want the the data on
[37:52] that I don't I'm not trying to sort that
[37:53] all the way out one thing that I that I
[37:56] that I do know is is when I have we've
[37:58] looked at different brothers that has
[38:00] worked face to face with some people uh
[38:04] they themselves I know it's been the
[38:05] hand of God watched over them and it has
[38:07] been God's hand some of them have worked
[38:09] theyve worked 12 straight hours in a CO
[38:11] unit right here in this assembly and yet
[38:15] they but you don't see them when they
[38:16] when they've been in the midst of that
[38:18] that's why you hadn't seen them for
[38:19] weeks because they're right in the
[38:21] midst I know their masks are a little
[38:24] different than our masks but uh I just
[38:27] we we need to work together in this time
[38:30] everybody okay am so uh don't let don't
[38:34] let that you know hinder you we want to
[38:36] do what we what we can we want to be
[38:39] able to come together the other thing is
[38:41] if something happens let's say you know
[38:43] that maybe you're seated something
[38:46] happens in your seated a little closely
[38:49] please don't be offended at the deacons
[38:51] I've asked them I watched them here back
[38:53] in July when we when they they were just
[38:55] they did such a tremendous job God just
[38:58] on the Fly seeding people I sat right
[39:00] back there and watched it I told him
[39:02] after service I thought I said my
[39:04] goodness how you all operated and they
[39:06] just such a team so please don't be
[39:08] offended if they tap you on the shoulder
[39:11] and that might be your favorite seat but
[39:13] maybe God wants you to take your
[39:14] anointing and go to a different seat
[39:16] that
[39:16] day so don't be offended just let's just
[39:19] try to work together through this here
[39:21] and um we're going to get through it
[39:25] we're going to get through it amen and I
[39:27] like I told you I'm not saying that as a
[39:28] pie in the sky I believe that I believe
[39:31] that and we are going to get through
[39:32] this we're going to have where we'll be
[39:34] able to have the fellowships and I'll be
[39:36] able to you know hug your hug your neck
[39:38] brothers that is and uh you know shake
[39:41] your hands things like that and U so you
[39:44] it's such a habit you know uh that I
[39:47] think brother Bill standing out there
[39:49] one time and I don't know when it was
[39:50] brother Bill maybe it was in U oh my
[39:54] maybe it was in uh May or or something
[39:57] time in June and and I just just walked
[39:59] out of here right off the platform and
[40:01] brother Bill stand out there I said God
[40:03] bless you brother Bill I rest up my hand
[40:04] he said brother Samuel
[40:07] remember and you know it's just
[40:09] something about it this is this and and
[40:11] I feel like this attack has been an
[40:13] attack to try to in many ways try to dis
[40:17] unify the body of Jesus Christ it's
[40:20] tried to come against a lot of the
[40:22] principles that are set forth but this
[40:24] is where we we we we want to just have a
[40:28] real our faith we're looking as we've
[40:30] been preaching on Sundays here we're
[40:32] looking unto Jesus the author and
[40:34] finisher of our faith that's where we
[40:35] get strength you focus on all this and
[40:38] I'm just going to be honest with you
[40:39] brother Samuel do you read everything
[40:42] no no do you keep up on everything
[40:46] no no I really don't I read little bits
[40:49] here and there but because a lot of the
[40:51] things anymore you know it and if you
[40:53] don't know it you can't see it
[40:55] already a lot of those things out there
[40:57] I don't know how else to say it I don't
[41:00] have I don't have
[41:01] confidence that the news and everything
[41:03] else I don't have confidence it's sad
[41:05] that we have to say that but it's true
[41:08] because you we trying to even of the
[41:11] months leading into us getting back
[41:13] together we'll preach in a minute don't
[41:15] worry in the months of us getting back
[41:17] together I I'm trying to go through all
[41:18] kinds of information trying to sort
[41:20] through information and then being on
[41:22] the phones with different people trying
[41:24] to sort all that through and uh
[41:27] it just is it's that in itself is an
[41:30] adventure trying to sort through it all
[41:33] but I'm thankful to God for his mercy
[41:36] and I just want to encourage each and
[41:37] every one of you let's keep pressing
[41:40] forward let's keep pressing forward and
[41:42] let's keep let's keep our Focus here on
[41:45] the end because soon and very soon we're
[41:47] going to see that amen so when we come
[41:52] here into the into the scripture tonight
[41:55] and we begin to look at this a few weeks
[41:58] ago and it struck my heart when we're
[42:00] looking at that which is of the
[42:03] spiritual part and and and I want to
[42:05] look at that Discerning the love of God
[42:07] once again how that Paul would write
[42:10] here to follow after charity Paul is
[42:13] giving given that this is to be the
[42:18] object if there's one thing that you're
[42:20] to be looking at and to be pursuing
[42:23] after and to giving yourself to it's
[42:27] charot which is the love of God which is
[42:31] the spirit of God which is the Holy
[42:34] Ghost because the Bible would would
[42:37] speak very clearly to us let no man love
[42:40] the world nor the things that are in the
[42:41] world if any man love the world the love
[42:44] of the father is not in it the Bible
[42:47] tells us God is love is that right over
[42:52] in the book of Timothy he has not given
[42:54] unto us spirit of fear but that of Power
[42:58] of Love of a sound mind so we recognize
[43:03] that that when we're speaking of this
[43:05] charity this is not a love that is based
[43:10] or is derived from Human love human Love
[43:14] Is fial Love and then it goes on down
[43:16] into that rotten love that becomes
[43:20] everything else but here charity is that
[43:23] which is of god and it is that where God
[43:26] himself self where the Bible says God so
[43:29] loved the world that he gave his only
[43:33] begotten son the Bible would tell us
[43:35] that God commended his love toward us in
[43:38] first John it would say here we see his
[43:41] love manifested to us this was a love
[43:45] that man as the Believers down through
[43:47] the Old Testament there would be
[43:49] glimpses of the love of God how that it
[43:52] would be demonstrated it would actually
[43:55] be expressed in the light
[43:57] of the prophets when God would come and
[44:00] Israel would go astray the love of God
[44:03] would move down to project himself his
[44:07] love his character and his nature in
[44:10] that message that was calling Israel
[44:14] back to the character and the desire
[44:16] that God had for their life that was the
[44:19] love of God and and many times we find
[44:22] that when we speak of Discerning the
[44:24] love of God that many times love itself
[44:28] within the view and light of the world
[44:31] it's everything is just Ooey and gooey
[44:34] and you feel good and nobody says
[44:36] anything like this and everybody is just
[44:39] you know every is just going along
[44:41] that's not that's not real love because
[44:44] remember the Bible says a true friend a
[44:47] true friend will also tell you where
[44:49] you're
[44:50] wrong is that right and the Bible says
[44:53] they that are wise are able to take
[44:55] rebuke and profit from it
[44:57] so we understand even at the very
[44:59] closing age uh in that age we're living
[45:02] in the that last closing Gentile age as
[45:05] many as I
[45:07] love I chasen and
[45:10] rebuke is that right be zealous
[45:12] therefore and repent it's love that lets
[45:15] us see our error love that lets us see
[45:18] our wrong but you see the love of God
[45:20] just does not point out the error and
[45:22] the wrong but he projects this is where
[45:25] you are to be and this is where you are
[45:29] and so his love has a way that it does
[45:31] not come to just Place us and cut us off
[45:34] here it corrects Us by letting us see
[45:37] this is where you need to be but you're
[45:39] living well Beneath Your Privilege and
[45:41] he comes to correct me we say God help
[45:43] me Lord let me climb into that place
[45:46] Lord Jesus that's the love of God you
[45:48] see the love of God would also be as it
[45:51] would Paul would write by inspiration in
[45:54] Ephesians 5 and he would write it with
[45:57] the mystery of of of Christ and his
[45:59] bride and say that that love that is
[46:01] projected it is a cleansing and
[46:04] sanctifying love I'm glad for that
[46:06] tonight because it cleanses from me even
[46:10] thoughts that that can arise that I
[46:12] would have about myself and God would
[46:14] say that is not my thoughts concerning
[46:16] you and his love is a sanctifying love
[46:19] it just comes in it it cleanses it it
[46:21] moves and it brings it actually brings
[46:24] about and draws out of us what God knows
[46:27] is within us this is the power of the
[46:31] love of God and so when we look at this
[46:34] this is why that in our lives when we
[46:37] think of it of how the song would be
[46:40] wrote redeeming love has been my theme
[46:44] and it shall be till I die love is to
[46:47] govern and this is where Paul as he's
[46:50] wrote here to to to the Corinthian
[46:53] Church uh remember this was a group of
[46:56] people when Paul in this group of
[46:59] scriptures here when he's writing to
[47:00] them and giving them the direction for
[47:03] their life and their order remember the
[47:06] they were showing up and one had a
[47:07] revelation one had a Psalm and one had a
[47:10] song and one had this and Paul said hey
[47:13] you know you appreciate seeing uh the
[47:16] gifts and things in the body but Paul
[47:18] let he draws them back to a place let
[47:21] everything be done unto edification and
[47:25] edification it's self is not blowing
[47:28] somebody up with a lot of hot air that's
[47:31] falsehood but edification is the holy
[47:34] spirit coming in the word and taking the
[47:37] word and ministering to you and I what
[47:39] is real strength real courage not just
[47:41] somebody coming under an anointing and
[47:43] then you get out there and you meet the
[47:45] devil and you backtrack but real real
[47:48] edification is it edifies it builds up
[47:51] and there's only one that can build up
[47:53] and that's the Holy Ghost because we are
[47:55] not the workmanship ship of any man or
[47:58] any church we are the workmanship of the
[48:01] Holy Ghost it is God edifying remember
[48:04] these works that come out of our life
[48:06] they were already within us like the
[48:08] Apple like the leaf that is within the
[48:10] apple seed what happens his life comes
[48:14] his word comes to draw out and manifest
[48:17] these works we were already ordained
[48:21] to so this is we are his workmanship we
[48:25] can take no glory or no credit for her
[48:28] own I think of how brother Brandon would
[48:30] say even when it came uh to the examples
[48:33] of the maniac you know in in Oregon
[48:36] where brother B said I I didn't despise
[48:38] the man when he came across the platform
[48:40] when he's there with the bees you know
[48:42] out in the yard and you know brother
[48:44] Bram said if IID have known they were
[48:45] there before I'd have had a can and
[48:46] sprayed them and things like that but
[48:48] you see even with that from the bees and
[48:50] also the bull and other situations even
[48:53] in his home brother Ram spoke of how
[48:55] that love itself came on the scene and
[48:58] took over and brother B said how you
[49:01] know within that it was Sovereign how
[49:03] God moved down but it had to be a heart
[49:06] and a life that was yielded to the love
[49:08] of God you see you got to be tapped into
[49:11] the source you cannot get electricity
[49:13] unless you are wired to the source and
[49:16] that's the same way it is with the love
[49:17] of God and even if you're Li wired to
[49:20] the source you got to make sure there is
[49:21] not a ground that comes in it sometimes
[49:25] you can have you know everything wired
[49:27] properly in your house but if maybe a
[49:29] light fixture that's around the shower
[49:31] or something like that it gets a little
[49:33] loose gets a little down moisture gets
[49:35] in there sometimes you get a short and
[49:36] you're wondering why is this fuse going
[49:38] out why is this happening because there
[49:40] is some elements that are affecting that
[49:43] circuitry and the flow of that
[49:44] electricity this is why that Jude would
[49:47] write to us and say keeping yourselves
[49:51] in the love of God it would admonish us
[49:54] that this is something where there is uh
[49:57] continual struggles uh in in that that
[50:01] we would stay within the love of God
[50:04] keeping our hearts in that so when we
[50:07] when we we see this uh here I think how
[50:10] Paul would write in 1 Corinthians 1613
[50:13] he says watch ye Stand Fast in the faith
[50:17] quit you like men be strong notice the
[50:20] next verse let all your things be done
[50:24] with charity
[50:28] the Bible says and all you do in word or
[50:30] deed do it all in the name of the Lord
[50:32] Jesus Christ and remember he came to
[50:36] manifest the name of the
[50:38] father Jesus was a human name he took
[50:42] for Redemptive purposes right but the
[50:45] name itself was more than just the name
[50:48] Jesus the power behind that is the life
[50:50] that same name was proclaimed when Moses
[50:54] was hidden in the Rock and he pass by
[50:57] and proclaim the name of the Lord and
[50:59] Jesus could say I have manifested thy
[51:03] name unto those thou Hast given me his
[51:07] name is who he is who he is he is the
[51:11] word it is his life it is him this is
[51:14] who he is your name is your character
[51:17] right so let all things be done with
[51:21] Charity in 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul
[51:25] admonishing after writing of all the
[51:28] gifts and placing order covet earnestly
[51:31] the best gifts and yet show I unto you a
[51:36] more excellent
[51:39] way Paul has admonished them to desire
[51:42] carefully the best meaning that which is
[51:47] the most useful and serviceable to the
[51:50] body Paul writes very clearly there are
[51:53] some things that if done such as he says
[51:58] if there's tongues and no
[52:00] interpretations who's
[52:02] edified you're edified but nobody else
[52:05] is right and Paul he sums it all up that
[52:09] let everything be done unto the
[52:14] edification of the body I want you to
[52:17] notice this the focus of
[52:21] edification is for the body you see the
[52:25] body is what God himself had in his mind
[52:30] his body his bride that that Temple that
[52:33] Dwelling Place those who were the genes
[52:37] of his body chosen in Christ that would
[52:40] be born of his spirit and they would
[52:43] make up his body his bride his wife you
[52:48] and I are standing in an hour where the
[52:51] marriage Revelations 19 the marriage of
[52:54] the Lamb has come this is a time we're
[52:57] down through 2,000 years here the
[52:59] building of the Bride body we know
[53:02] restoring back to that place it's a time
[53:05] where we see that the body that all the
[53:09] focus is to be in edifying the body of
[53:12] Jesus Christ in other words that
[53:15] everything is the things are not about
[53:17] you or it's not about me it's about my
[53:20] brother it's about my sister it's about
[53:23] the body
[53:28] so that means the focus here's it deals
[53:31] with Paul is dealing with that the focus
[53:33] of their life and walk with the Lord
[53:36] would have a true substance and a
[53:39] meaning that's not self-seeking or
[53:43] self-reliant but rather self-sacrificial
[53:46] with love governing the life behind
[53:49] every person whether gifted or
[53:54] not with the desire to to please the
[53:57] Lord walking in his word and harmony
[54:00] with my brothers and
[54:02] sisters you see Paul is putting he comes
[54:06] into a place now that we're going to
[54:08] read in 1 Corinthians 13 and he's
[54:11] putting he's taking the focus of the
[54:14] Corinthian Church they're seeing the
[54:16] supernatural
[54:18] done they're seeing
[54:20] gifts but yet what Paul is saying is is
[54:24] that we need to have first things
[54:27] first and that is Charity should be
[54:31] first the love of God should be first
[54:35] the Holy Ghost should have the oversight
[54:38] within it that's what Paul is bringing
[54:41] them back to he's letting going to let
[54:43] him know here as we read in a few
[54:44] moments without that everything you
[54:47] could do no matter how great it is it's
[54:52] nothing so it doesn't matter how gifted
[54:55] or whether person's gifted or not there
[54:58] might be a person that can sit right
[54:59] here in this
[55:01] assembly and they don't seem like
[55:03] seemingly say a peep at
[55:06] all but they are
[55:09] steadfast they are faithful they are
[55:12] live their life is a living
[55:15] witness their mouth it's not their mouth
[55:17] that testifies so much their life
[55:20] testifies brother Brandon tells us
[55:22] something like this he says you ought to
[55:23] be such a Christian I believe this
[55:26] that you don't have to your neighbor
[55:28] doesn't have to ask if you're a
[55:30] Christian your neighbor just Knows by
[55:32] watching
[55:34] you I'm talking about the Life of Christ
[55:37] This is not something that is put on
[55:40] that like a coat you take it off and and
[55:43] and you know when you leave church and
[55:45] then you put it back
[55:47] on so many times you run into people
[55:49] sometimes on the job one morning and
[55:51] they say well you know uh you know uh oh
[55:53] my religion I got to lay my religion
[55:55] down if you can lay it down it's not
[55:57] very
[55:59] powerful because when the love of God
[56:02] has come it's it's power brother it's
[56:05] not something you even want to lay down
[56:07] it's who you are it's what directs your
[56:11] life it's what causes you to turn your
[56:13] head it's what sets your life In Motion
[56:16] what is it the love of God not a law the
[56:19] love of God 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I
[56:24] speak with the tongues of men and of of
[56:26] angels and have not charity I'm become a
[56:30] sounding brass or a tingling
[56:33] symbol and though I have the gift of
[56:36] Prophecy and understand all Ministries
[56:38] that's
[56:39] preaching understand all Mysteries and
[56:42] all knowledge and though I have all
[56:44] Faith so that I could remove Mountain I
[56:47] tell you that's some that's some Faith
[56:49] are you with me remember Jesus said if
[56:52] you have faith the size of a grain of
[56:54] mustard seed you say to this mountain be
[56:58] thou removed plucked up and cast into
[57:01] Yonder sea and here Paul writing under
[57:05] divine inspiration he's bringing it back
[57:08] and he says though you have faith to
[57:10] move mountains without charity it's
[57:13] nothing it's not that mountains weren't
[57:17] being moved
[57:19] right but he's trying to bring it back
[57:22] to a place there is got there the focus
[57:25] and the achievement is by the love of
[57:29] God in the word of God in the body of
[57:32] Jesus
[57:36] Christ God helps me to make that clear
[57:39] and have not charity I'm nothing and
[57:42] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[57:45] poor and though I give my body to be
[57:49] burned have not charity it proth me
[57:51] nothing you know what Paul said you can
[57:55] give you you can give you can hand out
[57:57] to people and hand out to people but if
[57:59] you haven't turned your life over to God
[58:04] fully it's
[58:07] nothing you said can that be possible
[58:09] can a could a person actually preach or
[58:13] speak in tongues and and their life
[58:15] they've never surrendered their life
[58:18] you've seen it right in the word look at
[58:20] balum balum
[58:22] prophesied balum said a star shall arise
[58:24] out of Jacob that wasn't and balum but
[58:27] notice here how the spirit It Came Upon
[58:30] him but balum down on the inside was
[58:36] false because he stood against the work
[58:40] of God what God was doing that right in
[58:44] Israel there was a there was a Brazen
[58:47] serpent in the camp sure were those
[58:50] people did those people have mistakes
[58:52] and everything else sure they did even
[58:54] to where bao would take him around in a
[58:57] place and say come over here let me show
[58:59] you the hinder parts of Israel but
[59:01] remember even though listen to me the
[59:04] prophecies themselves were right on the
[59:07] dot but bam was a false
[59:11] prophet why he spake against the work of
[59:16] God he lent himself he he lent himself
[59:20] to that let me just rephrase that for a
[59:23] moment here the prophecies that were
[59:25] given was in indeed here the spirit of
[59:27] God but yet he's a false prophet cuz
[59:30] he's he's coming against and he works to
[59:33] mingle the coming against it is to
[59:35] mingle and to try to join it together
[59:38] and notice notice balum he begins to
[59:41] preach a love
[59:43] message bring them all up there the
[59:46] moabites women started
[59:48] dancing and here lust rose up that's
[59:51] what the Bible says lust rose up you
[59:54] know Israel shouldn't even went to that
[59:56] Feast the Bible says not we are not to
[1:00:00] be yolked with the
[1:00:02] world when you recognize that there's
[1:00:05] people in the world you see their
[1:00:07] objectives you see their motives sure
[1:00:09] there's things that we try with the
[1:00:11] objective to try to win other lives and
[1:00:14] every life you look at I trust you do
[1:00:16] this is how I look at it God is this a
[1:00:18] potential seed you put across my path
[1:00:21] and if it's not a seed maybe it's one
[1:00:24] that they're just to be stirred in in
[1:00:26] that category that they belong in but
[1:00:28] let my life and testimony of you Lord
[1:00:31] let it be something that sets them in
[1:00:35] motion that's a desire that's how I feel
[1:00:38] when I'm talking with people we don't
[1:00:39] know that but see here he he begin to
[1:00:42] preach but you see that was a message of
[1:00:44] Baum was preaching of love but it lacked
[1:00:47] the Center focus and that was the real
[1:00:51] love of God which is the word of God
[1:00:54] keeping the word of God
[1:00:56] what did it bring sin immorality
[1:01:00] uncleanliness and that brought the
[1:01:02] Judgment of God is that right it brought
[1:01:06] the Judgment of God upon Israel because
[1:01:09] God won't play with
[1:01:10] sin so here even to see this Jesus said
[1:01:16] here he said many will come to me in
[1:01:20] that day they're going to say unto me
[1:01:22] Lord Lord have not I prophesied in thy
[1:01:24] name done many wonderful works and he
[1:01:28] will say depart from me I never knew you
[1:01:32] never had a
[1:01:34] relationship with
[1:01:37] you you knew me you used my anointing
[1:01:40] but you never allowed my life to become
[1:01:44] the center of your
[1:01:45] life you profited from my anointing come
[1:01:49] on now you you know you preached and the
[1:01:52] gift I plac your you recognize the Bible
[1:01:55] says gifts and callings are without
[1:01:58] repentance Elvis Presley will give an
[1:02:01] account for how he used that gift yeah
[1:02:05] even the men that and people who write
[1:02:07] songs if that's what you call them
[1:02:09] nowadays and other and everything else
[1:02:11] uh and I'm talking about even some of
[1:02:12] the Christian artists and whatever more
[1:02:14] you see you give an account you give an
[1:02:16] account with the gift of how you use a
[1:02:19] gift you must be a steward of the gift
[1:02:22] in your
[1:02:23] life you have to be a steward Steward is
[1:02:26] keeping that gift here coming into this
[1:02:29] place uh Jesus you know would would
[1:02:32] would express it that many many can come
[1:02:36] will come to me and say have not I done
[1:02:38] all these things but where did Jesus say
[1:02:40] he takes them back to a place to
[1:02:42] recognize that a wise man will hear my
[1:02:45] sayings and do them and he is like a man
[1:02:48] who builds his house upon a rock then he
[1:02:51] takes another man who will not do the
[1:02:53] will of God because it's going to cost
[1:02:55] him
[1:02:57] and so then what then what transpires he
[1:03:00] builds his house upon the
[1:03:04] sand storms are going to
[1:03:08] come same storms are going to come are
[1:03:11] you hearing me the same storms are going
[1:03:13] to come we're not exempt in here from
[1:03:15] whether it be cancer or whatever more
[1:03:17] we're not exempt from that we're not
[1:03:20] exempt from other things it's just like
[1:03:23] when all this virus and whatever broke
[1:03:25] out we're not exempt from
[1:03:27] that are you with me we're not exempt
[1:03:31] from from these things and and whatever
[1:03:33] more but you recognize that within it
[1:03:36] the rains and and the floods we're not
[1:03:38] exempt from you know where people here
[1:03:40] walking and then all of a sudden they
[1:03:42] depart and they want to speak evil of
[1:03:45] the way of God we're not we're not
[1:03:47] exempt from that rains com Storms Come
[1:03:50] floods come all those things come but
[1:03:53] what makes the difference where your
[1:03:55] life is
[1:03:57] founded if it's on Sand it'll give way
[1:04:01] it cannot stand the rain it can't stand
[1:04:04] the storm or the wind but if it's
[1:04:06] founded on the Rock brother let the
[1:04:09] storms come let the rain come let the
[1:04:12] wind blow we've got a place of safety
[1:04:15] it's a refuge it's an anchor that when
[1:04:18] it's howling outside there is an anchor
[1:04:20] in my soul that I know that I know that
[1:04:23] I know I have been
[1:04:26] redeemed I have been Bor of his Spirit
[1:04:30] and the love of God abiding in my soul
[1:04:33] says he's got it in
[1:04:37] control this is
[1:04:39] why I'm just going to refer to some of
[1:04:42] these places this is why when brother
[1:04:45] Brandon would he in preaching the
[1:04:46] message a token he would talk about just
[1:04:50] let me paraphrase it don't try to find
[1:04:51] me in it he just would talk about when
[1:04:53] it came to applying the blood in Exodus
[1:04:56] 12 and he said there could have been one
[1:04:59] who was a priest or whoever he
[1:05:02] was and he looks at and says uhuh I'm
[1:05:06] not going to do that I'm not going to
[1:05:08] ply that blood I don't want to be
[1:05:09] identified with
[1:05:11] that it didn't
[1:05:13] matter how much of a priest that man was
[1:05:17] I don't care who he was are you with me
[1:05:20] Jesus stood right in the face of
[1:05:22] Nicodemus right come on now that's a
[1:05:26] good
[1:05:27] man man you couldn't put your finger on
[1:05:29] his life but Jesus didn't look at him in
[1:05:32] his you know his attire and they had
[1:05:34] that you know their blue tassels and
[1:05:35] everything like that Jesus didn't say oh
[1:05:37] this guy's a Pharisee he's a religious
[1:05:39] he said you must be born
[1:05:45] again you know some of the toughest
[1:05:47] roughest nastiest meanest devils are
[1:05:50] religious
[1:05:52] Devils that's a
[1:05:54] truth so no matter how much that a man
[1:05:58] you know where where he's at how much he
[1:06:00] give to the poor think about it right
[1:06:03] somebody giv to the poor sacrificing
[1:06:05] their body but if it's not the love of
[1:06:09] God in their
[1:06:13] heart it's not even reckoned to
[1:06:24] Europe like I had a lady one time at
[1:06:26] work you know they always want to ask
[1:06:27] the spir spiritual question hey hey Sam
[1:06:30] come here for a minute you know I got
[1:06:33] this big check and you know my
[1:06:34] ex-husband he had a hard time and you
[1:06:37] know so what I thought I would do is I
[1:06:39] thought I would take my ties out of
[1:06:41] there and he had a hard time and I
[1:06:42] thought I would give my ti to him what
[1:06:44] do you think I said you did
[1:06:47] wrong but he needed help I said that
[1:06:50] tithe is God's money you want to help
[1:06:53] him get in your other pocket and get
[1:06:55] give him some money out of
[1:06:57] that come on now the Bible said why will
[1:06:59] a man rob
[1:07:02] God how did we get
[1:07:04] there notice you see this is why brother
[1:07:08] B would narrow it right down he said I'm
[1:07:10] nothing he takes that whole scriptures
[1:07:12] we read I'm nothing until the token's
[1:07:14] been applied until this
[1:07:17] token this
[1:07:18] light brother Andrew was preaching about
[1:07:21] this last week we've been we've been
[1:07:23] ministering about this that's been the
[1:07:25] theme how can how can I not preach and
[1:07:27] this be the theme no matter what angle
[1:07:29] what service it's an experience with
[1:07:33] God there has to be something what is
[1:07:35] that experience to where inside of here
[1:07:37] you pass from Death unto
[1:07:42] life times you
[1:07:44] see people can have many experiences and
[1:07:47] then you see no transformation in their
[1:07:49] life and you would wonder and say well
[1:07:53] they know they they felt that God was
[1:07:55] real but that experience was to let them
[1:07:57] know I am real why do you think when God
[1:08:00] would come in the meetings and discern
[1:08:02] the thoughts and intense of the heart
[1:08:04] and declare that I'm the same Lord Jesus
[1:08:07] that that rose up on that Easter morning
[1:08:09] and ascended back he's doing the same
[1:08:11] works that he said he would do he's the
[1:08:14] same one that stood there in flesh
[1:08:16] before Abraham's tent door why was he
[1:08:18] doing that to build the faith of his
[1:08:20] elect children in the word to receive
[1:08:23] and ask for what belonged to him
[1:08:27] Hallelujah he makes known to you and I
[1:08:29] in this generation what belongs to us by
[1:08:32] manifesting his
[1:08:36] word this token this life where there's
[1:08:39] been a change on the inside of your
[1:08:44] life that's why Paul would say think
[1:08:47] about the deception Paul would talk
[1:08:50] about they receive not the love of the
[1:08:53] truth is that right
[1:08:56] so when we think of this of even that of
[1:09:01] the love of God and
[1:09:04] remember when Jesus remember they they
[1:09:07] always wanted to ask him questions and
[1:09:08] try to trap him and they would ask him
[1:09:11] what's the greatest
[1:09:12] commandment Jesus
[1:09:14] said the Lord thy God is
[1:09:17] one is that right he would say the Lord
[1:09:20] our God is one Lord and thou shalt love
[1:09:24] the Lord thy God with all by heart soul
[1:09:27] mind body strength in other words all of
[1:09:31] you God don't want part of you he didn't
[1:09:35] bring a partial Redemption right he
[1:09:39] don't bring partial
[1:09:42] Deliverance when he comes he brings
[1:09:47] hope he his works are
[1:09:51] complete are you with me amen he there
[1:09:55] is a complete work and notice here even
[1:09:58] when Jesus would would respond in this
[1:10:01] here in the scriptures here the Pharisee
[1:10:05] The Scribe the lawyer would
[1:10:08] respond after Jesus would say and you
[1:10:11] know the other is like is like so Thou
[1:10:14] shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:10:19] thyself because how can you love God
[1:10:23] whom you've not seen and not love your
[1:10:27] brother it's working contrary to God's
[1:10:30] desired
[1:10:32] goal and even an enemy how can you not
[1:10:36] love your
[1:10:38] enemies I'm talking about something
[1:10:40] that's much deeper than our feeling of
[1:10:43] love I'm not talking about something
[1:10:45] that just is walking up and ooey gooey
[1:10:48] and oh I love you I love that's not what
[1:10:51] I'm talking about I'm talking about a
[1:10:53] love that really praise
[1:10:56] a love that Jesus said pray for your
[1:10:59] enemies how can you love your enemy well
[1:11:02] I just be honest with you if let's say
[1:11:04] Brother Carlos you're not my enemy buddy
[1:11:07] but if Brother Carlos did something one
[1:11:08] more I don't love what he
[1:11:11] did but as far as that man on the inside
[1:11:15] I love that
[1:11:17] man but I don't love what he
[1:11:19] did but to love that man on the
[1:11:23] inside that's what brought God on the
[1:11:26] scene in Portland
[1:11:29] Oregon to be so in contact with God and
[1:11:33] to have the love of God in such a place
[1:11:35] think of it brother brandham himself he
[1:11:37] was not standing there to be seen look
[1:11:39] at when he's there in deep C to De you
[1:11:41] can watch that you can see that right
[1:11:43] here the discernment taking place think
[1:11:46] about it this is not a a Benny hen or a
[1:11:48] smiley Texon or somebody trying to get
[1:11:51] money but it stand there and say steps
[1:11:53] up to the platform say is I'm not here
[1:11:56] to be seen I'm not here for your money
[1:11:59] it is not a
[1:12:01] show the gift of God is not a show it's
[1:12:04] for the body of Jesus Christ that the
[1:12:08] body might be edified that the body
[1:12:11] might be built up in the work of
[1:12:15] God not furthering an organization God
[1:12:18] doesn't want to further no work of man
[1:12:22] is interested in his his work
[1:12:25] this is why that scribe Pharisee lawyer
[1:12:29] he said that is true Lord that is true
[1:12:33] and it's greater than all the whole
[1:12:35] burnt offerings that can be given to
[1:12:37] fulfill that but love the Lord thy God
[1:12:40] with all thy heart and love thy neighbor
[1:12:41] as thyself is greater than every
[1:12:43] sacrifice that can be given you see it's
[1:12:45] to be the underlying theme of our life
[1:12:48] the love of God is you realize
[1:12:51] love love will push Faith to do things
[1:12:56] Faith does not push love love pushes
[1:13:02] Faith so it's looking at the motive and
[1:13:06] the objective the love of God is Not
[1:13:10] erratic it operates according to the
[1:13:14] program of of God according to the will
[1:13:17] of see when anything is done no matter
[1:13:20] how good or how righteous it may
[1:13:23] seem without the the love of God
[1:13:25] motivating and directing it and backing
[1:13:28] it up it's about
[1:13:30] self just no other way to cut this cake
[1:13:34] it's about
[1:13:35] self the love of God will always direct
[1:13:38] us in humility according to the word of
[1:13:41] God according to the will of
[1:13:44] God sometimes we've got to
[1:13:47] wait but the love of God remember the
[1:13:50] Bible says the love of God constrain us
[1:13:56] sometimes it's just like it's it's
[1:13:58] bubbling right there on my
[1:14:00] lips what should I do Jesus help me to
[1:14:03] keep my mouth
[1:14:06] shut and it isn't necessarily you ain't
[1:14:08] going to speak truth but there's
[1:14:10] sometimes listen this is why the Bible
[1:14:12] says a word spoken in
[1:14:16] season you need words that are spoken in
[1:14:21] season you say God what help me to be in
[1:14:24] contact with the season with your loved
[1:14:27] ones wife home husband on and on and on
[1:14:30] and on and on co-workers help me to be
[1:14:33] in
[1:14:34] season you see it's self sacrifice this
[1:14:37] is Charity charity has nothing to do
[1:14:40] with self look what look at the
[1:14:42] operation of Charity I sanctify myself
[1:14:45] for their
[1:14:47] sakes he came
[1:14:50] down he came down and took upon a robe
[1:14:53] of Flesh he did not go to to a
[1:14:55] palace he said the foxes have a
[1:14:59] den holes places to lay their head but
[1:15:02] the son of man has no
[1:15:05] place the one who could have made
[1:15:08] himself a reputation was the very one
[1:15:12] when healing took place he said keep it
[1:15:14] down go go go go go go to the temple and
[1:15:17] do what Moses said to be offer he was
[1:15:20] not drawing attention to some who was it
[1:15:22] the focus notice this is what
[1:15:25] the very Ministry of Jesus Christ when
[1:15:27] he was here in a human body I love how
[1:15:29] brother Ram puts it it was the god of
[1:15:32] Glory come down to reveal the glory of
[1:15:35] God it was God showing himself God had a
[1:15:40] vest or we could say it like this Jesus
[1:15:43] Christ was the canvas that God was able
[1:15:47] to portray the great portrait of his
[1:15:50] life and of his
[1:15:53] nature it was a port
[1:15:55] that
[1:15:59] is it's breath it's depth it's
[1:16:05] height it's
[1:16:09] overtake self
[1:16:12] sacrifice you see it's self-sacrifice
[1:16:14] that brought the love of God into our
[1:16:16] hearts it was him that led us to
[1:16:22] die look every one of us that are
[1:16:24] married married in here
[1:16:26] tonight in order to really be married
[1:16:28] and United you had to die had to be a
[1:16:31] part of you to die and after you get
[1:16:33] married you got to keep on
[1:16:36] dying certain little things that you
[1:16:38] recognize that might be pet peeves you
[1:16:41] recognize after a while uhuh I'm not
[1:16:43] those are not going to be pet peeves no
[1:16:45] longer they're still pet peeves but we
[1:16:47] just don't feed them doggy
[1:16:49] treats you get what I'm saying we do no
[1:16:52] longer put them up there and value what
[1:16:54] this is a step well you learn right you
[1:16:57] let go of
[1:17:00] things I then what do they say the
[1:17:02] phrase somebody a gentleman the other
[1:17:04] day in the parking lot you know stopped
[1:17:05] me and I helped him load something in
[1:17:07] his truck I seen you out there was a
[1:17:09] little difficulty I have him open load
[1:17:11] some cabinets he said I'm doing all this
[1:17:13] for my wife he said you know how they
[1:17:14] say happy wife happy life he he sounded
[1:17:18] happy about it too you know but but the
[1:17:20] reality is is that you know in the
[1:17:23] things that we do you know Peter said
[1:17:25] let the husband honor the wife as as
[1:17:28] unto the weaker vessel is that right
[1:17:31] that doesn't mean that she's controlling
[1:17:33] you that doesn't mean she's leading you
[1:17:35] around but what it simply means is that
[1:17:37] you're bestowing that honor she's the
[1:17:39] queen of the
[1:17:42] home how do we get
[1:17:44] here follow after charity that's how we
[1:17:47] got here it's
[1:17:49] care it's ministering there into
[1:17:52] different needs now let me just
[1:17:55] let me just let me just try to TI this
[1:17:58] up
[1:18:00] here brother Brandon would would talk
[1:18:02] about here throughout the message and he
[1:18:05] would say this this over and
[1:18:09] over he said as far as when it comes to
[1:18:14] gifts he said we've tried said a lot of
[1:18:16] times there's been gifts that and a a
[1:18:18] lot of times he said people try to judge
[1:18:20] people by gifts think about gifts is
[1:18:23] it's a supernatural work
[1:18:25] oh that's a supernatural work but
[1:18:28] friends let me tell you something a gift
[1:18:30] itself that doesn't tie you closer to
[1:18:33] Jesus Christ you better get away
[1:18:35] from if it's a gift that's working to
[1:18:38] draw you closer
[1:18:39] to itself the flesh you better
[1:18:44] run every gift that is operating by the
[1:18:48] love of God is for one achievement it's
[1:18:51] for the body of Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:53] glory of God
[1:18:55] and it's that our faith would be tied
[1:18:57] into Jesus
[1:18:59] Christ not to where we're running back
[1:19:02] to this person or running back to that
[1:19:04] person no no no the gift the gift itself
[1:19:07] this is why think of it when when when
[1:19:10] when brother Bram would tell us judge he
[1:19:13] says many people judge people by gifts
[1:19:16] but he says if we don't use them in the
[1:19:17] right way that we're intended for them
[1:19:19] to be used they can do more harm than
[1:19:22] good how many churches have been split
[1:19:26] up with people's
[1:19:28] feelings I got a vision about this or I
[1:19:31] got a tongue about this and I got but
[1:19:33] they don't have
[1:19:36] wisdom listen knowledge is being able to
[1:19:39] see certain things and what did the
[1:19:41] prophet tell us in Christ the
[1:19:44] mystery he said there's a lot of things
[1:19:46] that are not called out right here
[1:19:48] because if it was called out it would
[1:19:50] cause Penitentiary offenses
[1:19:54] see that's
[1:19:56] wisdom that's the number one gift right
[1:19:58] there
[1:19:59] wisdom you with me that's the first one
[1:20:02] to
[1:20:03] mentioned that's the gift that's
[1:20:05] mentioned and that's it though all of
[1:20:07] out of the nine spiritual the eight can
[1:20:10] operate tongues itself the other eight
[1:20:12] can be operating and are operating right
[1:20:15] in a body and you may not even know
[1:20:20] it unless somebody wants to broadcast it
[1:20:25] God used me to do this and do this do
[1:20:27] that that's a
[1:20:28] bragger woo I ain't even there
[1:20:31] yet you see there are a lot of things
[1:20:34] that God God don't want you spreading
[1:20:37] around that's between you and him hello
[1:20:41] somebody you see this is where brother
[1:20:44] Bron think of this statement let me read
[1:20:46] a few of these he said I would rather
[1:20:47] see Brotherly Love existing among the
[1:20:51] church if we didn't have one case of
[1:20:53] healing or anything else
[1:20:56] you see the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:20:59] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:21:01] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:21:03] against such there's no
[1:21:07] love oh
[1:21:09] my brother BR said I'm just going to I'm
[1:21:11] going to keep moving through this he
[1:21:13] said I would rather have the Life of
[1:21:15] Christ in me to live sweet and
[1:21:17] Victorious that I would all the gifts of
[1:21:20] healing the gifts of prophecies and all
[1:21:22] them other gifts just give me
[1:21:25] Jesus let me live the life the life is
[1:21:28] what I want to live I want to live so
[1:21:30] others will know you know what I'm
[1:21:32] talking about there is people who are
[1:21:35] gospel
[1:21:37] hardened they are burnt on religion and
[1:21:41] the gospel they've seen enough fake
[1:21:44] preachers come on preach with me they've
[1:21:46] seen enough fake Christians yeah preach
[1:21:49] brother Samuel they've seen them live
[1:21:52] one way in church and in the PO
[1:21:55] and live like Hypocrites at home preach
[1:21:58] brother Samuel you see when this is why
[1:22:01] we desire not it's not gifts we desire
[1:22:05] that life let me live such a sweet and
[1:22:09] Victorious Life in Jesus
[1:22:12] Christ is that right I'd rather have
[1:22:16] that than all the gifts brother said if
[1:22:19] here he said if I came to the Lord Jesus
[1:22:22] he said as a sinner and he he said boy
[1:22:26] I'll give you the gift to preach I'll
[1:22:28] give you the gift of tongues I'll give
[1:22:30] you the gift of Prophecy I'll give you
[1:22:32] every one of these gifts or I'll give
[1:22:34] you real Divine love in your heart he
[1:22:37] said I would tell him give me real
[1:22:40] Divine
[1:22:43] love because charity never
[1:22:49] fail where all these other things are
[1:22:52] they will cease but the love of God in
[1:22:55] your heart one day glory be to God I'll
[1:22:58] preach my last
[1:23:01] sermon one of these days you'll sing
[1:23:04] your last song on this side cuz you'll
[1:23:06] be singing over
[1:23:08] there understand one of these days but
[1:23:11] let me tell you something one of these
[1:23:12] days will be your last test will be your
[1:23:15] last trial one of these days will be the
[1:23:17] last day it'll be the last time you
[1:23:19] touch the alarm clock it'll be the last
[1:23:21] time but brother let me tell you
[1:23:22] something the love of God that's come
[1:23:24] into your life that pulsates in your
[1:23:27] heart that makes you love God you love
[1:23:30] his word you give yourself to him you
[1:23:32] live in this word that same Holy Ghost
[1:23:35] the love of God will pack you into the
[1:23:39] love of
[1:23:42] God what will take us there in rapturing
[1:23:45] faith the love of
[1:23:48] God it says why we don't judge our life
[1:23:52] brother BR would say it in a prisoner he
[1:23:53] said don't judge judge your life by how
[1:23:55] how much power you had to perform
[1:23:57] Miracles don't judge yourself by how
[1:24:00] much knowledge you have of the word but
[1:24:02] always judge yourself look back and take
[1:24:05] inventory of what kind of a fruit that
[1:24:08] the life you presently live now is
[1:24:15] bearing apple trees bear apples orange
[1:24:18] trees bear
[1:24:21] oranges here in Galatians 56
[1:24:25] the Bible lays very clearly faith it
[1:24:30] works by
[1:24:32] love love is the power of God the
[1:24:37] creative power of God that works or
[1:24:40] operates in the heart of the
[1:24:42] believer again Faith remember it Faith
[1:24:46] itself is sight to be able to look
[1:24:49] Beyond it gives sight to look Beyond and
[1:24:53] and to look
[1:24:55] to look
[1:24:58] up when brother Brandon would take
[1:25:01] this and he would preach the
[1:25:03] token September of 63 then that night he
[1:25:07] would tell them in the message token he
[1:25:09] said tonight I'm going to preach on love
[1:25:11] and he preaches the message
[1:25:16] desperation and he lays it out clearly
[1:25:18] he says what we find he said among
[1:25:21] people is a lack of the love of God
[1:25:25] and he said when there's a lack of the
[1:25:26] love of
[1:25:28] God it declares itself in lack of
[1:25:33] desperation people just kind of just
[1:25:36] going
[1:25:37] through kind of going through motions
[1:25:39] you see listen if we can try to take
[1:25:41] this and sum it all into one
[1:25:44] place it's to know the ground that
[1:25:47] you're
[1:25:48] standing is the love of
[1:25:51] God my wife is not afraid
[1:25:55] if she Burns a cake she burns my
[1:25:58] shirt or if something happens during the
[1:26:01] day and she doesn't get dinner
[1:26:05] on I'm not going to throw her out of the
[1:26:09] house no
[1:26:12] better she's not afraid of
[1:26:15] me you with me she's not afraid of me
[1:26:18] she's not doing that boy I better have
[1:26:20] this if I don't have this going to be I
[1:26:23] tell you what's the truth oh my S she's
[1:26:25] not this is not how it's
[1:26:27] up could I be disappointed yeah may be
[1:26:31] disappointed but you see it's not
[1:26:34] operated on a
[1:26:36] law neither does that mean that she
[1:26:39] takes
[1:26:41] advantage there's things sometimes that
[1:26:43] comes up there's things sometimes that
[1:26:45] maybe she gets a little her energy is
[1:26:47] just dep
[1:26:49] pleas maybe not able to do this not I'm
[1:26:52] just using examples I'm not trying to
[1:26:53] use an
[1:26:55] he understand so don't Oh Sister Kim
[1:26:57] just do an example to say the point of
[1:27:00] it's not by
[1:27:02] law what do you mean whether I sing or
[1:27:06] whether I
[1:27:08] preach I am
[1:27:10] Christ the love of God is settled in my
[1:27:15] heart I know that I've been redeemed
[1:27:18] whether I'm whether whether whether I do
[1:27:21] anything I don't have to do one more
[1:27:23] thing
[1:27:28] and that's settled like that that it's
[1:27:31] the love of God the love of God it's
[1:27:33] operating a man doesn't care if he's the
[1:27:35] one preaching or
[1:27:37] not person doesn't care if they're the
[1:27:39] one singing a special or not they would
[1:27:41] it wouldn't even maybe someone say hey
[1:27:43] you you we got too many specials W you
[1:27:45] sing on Thursday
[1:27:47] Thursday but I'm a Sunday
[1:27:50] singer Thursday
[1:27:55] though we could
[1:27:57] sing that choirs would ask that Angels
[1:28:00] would say could we join that
[1:28:02] off I'll
[1:28:06] Cherry so a man can have all knowledge
[1:28:09] and put it all together without
[1:28:14] charity everything that could be done
[1:28:17] without charity is nothing this is why
[1:28:22] the scripture admonition of every
[1:28:24] everything that's done in the church
[1:28:27] everything that's done in our life
[1:28:29] follow after charity and when listen
[1:28:33] this is where the spirit of God comes by
[1:28:35] his word to deal with our lives when
[1:28:38] he's drawing a light you realize as he
[1:28:40] draws our life into a real a real Born
[1:28:44] Again experience you realize what that
[1:28:46] is drawing the love of God Jesus said If
[1:28:50] any man love me he will keep my
[1:28:56] he says and the father and I they one we
[1:28:59] will come and make our Abode in
[1:29:06] him why will he come and Unite with
[1:29:08] someone who doesn't love it's falling in
[1:29:10] love with
[1:29:12] you and the love of God see this is
[1:29:14] where the pursuing after the love of God
[1:29:16] let the love of God be the theme of
[1:29:19] church I'd rather that be I'd rather
[1:29:22] that be know
[1:29:24] I think how brother BR would say in
[1:29:25] church order he
[1:29:26] said he said the Tabernacle here he said
[1:29:29] is not
[1:29:30] known he said out there and among other
[1:29:33] places because we have more gifts than
[1:29:36] anybody we don't have more gifts he go
[1:29:40] lays out all that he said but what it is
[1:29:42] a
[1:29:46] quality you I want you to catch this
[1:29:48] that quality of spirit same thing in
[1:29:50] Humble thyself brother Bram it takes us
[1:29:52] back into the days when the church was
[1:29:54] started and he said there would be
[1:29:56] people that would come up and they would
[1:29:58] see the congregation of
[1:30:01] people say how do you get people
[1:30:05] together what they were watching is they
[1:30:07] said them people love
[1:30:11] one Jesus said if you have loved one for
[1:30:14] another then will all men know you are
[1:30:18] my
[1:30:22] disciples thank God that's been the
[1:30:24] testimony but we don't we don't want
[1:30:27] that to become the
[1:30:30] tradition you know what that comes from
[1:30:32] hearts that are dedicated full of the
[1:30:35] Holy
[1:30:37] Ghost it's
[1:30:39] true I'm going over my
[1:30:42] time and you know what sometimes you
[1:30:44] have to bear with people who are not
[1:30:47] Believers not been born again and never
[1:30:50] will be born again
[1:30:54] they're anointed for trouble preach
[1:30:57] brother Samuel but it's the test the
[1:31:00] love of God will you allow that to bring
[1:31:03] division or the admonition in Christ the
[1:31:06] mystery cling that much
[1:31:09] closer stay with your
[1:31:12] pastor stay with that word the word
[1:31:14] what's the word doing binding you to
[1:31:16] Christ who is the strength and resource
[1:31:18] of our
[1:31:21] Liv follow after charity
[1:31:25] follow after it pursue it
[1:31:28] eagerly if the love of God is abiding in
[1:31:31] your heart then you know that and yet
[1:31:34] still it's following after charity what
[1:31:36] you getting ready to do let the love of
[1:31:38] God what how should I look at the
[1:31:40] situation put the love of God and look

[1:38:03] Heart Lord God like your Prophet talked
[1:38:05] about that mother deer when that call
[1:38:08] was made like that little Fawn was in
[1:38:11] distress and that Mama charged right out
[1:38:14] of the thicket she looked around she
[1:38:16] knew that Hunter was
[1:38:18] there but it drew something in her that
[1:38:21] attribute of mother
[1:38:25] God there's a greater call that's going
[1:38:29] out it's not a distress call but it's a
[1:38:33] call to the soul that is
[1:38:36] distressed that says come unto me all ye
[1:38:40] that are heavy laden and I will give you
[1:38:44] rest oh God I ask in the name of Jesus

[1:39:03] you meet them there may the love of God
[1:39:05] so sweep down lord may it overtake them
[1:39:08] Lord God that they can realize there's
[1:39:11] one who cares for me there's one who

[1:40:05] chase after the
[1:40:07] supernatural the supernatural gifts you
[1:40:09] see
[1:40:11] working but those gifts are
[1:40:14] manifested for God to convey his love
