========================================

the hand of God that was upon the nation and how that God had established that they they were completely focused upon that when the whole Proclamation was signed and put in place by George Washington but I look at this scripture here and and I my you know my heart just drawn to it and we many times will refer to it of how that there was only one who turned to give things but within the Scriptures it speaks of how that they as lepers they were standing afar off they were not even worthy to be in the place of where Jesus was they couldn't even come into that village because Leppert leprosy itself was a spiritual condition or it was actually it's a physical condition when it's in it and it deals with a lack of a proper diet but we understand that leprosy when we also look at it it's a spiritual condition there is nothing and nothing that could actually turn that around when leprosy hit in that was that was the curse there was nothing turning that around except God and so here they are standing out that was just like you and I there is no way that we could ever bring ourselves into the economy of God but God took notice of us and there was that part of himself that moved within our hearts to recognize him think of this when he walks in they say Jesus have mercy on us they didn't ask for his justice they asked for his mercy because anything that has come our way it's because of the mercy of God every healing every deliverance every prayer the baptism of the Holy Ghost there are eyes being open it is the mercy of God that has come our way and so when we we look at it when Jesus he says to them he says go show yourselves under the priest I want you to look at this he never he never even said or laid his hands on them and said you're well but he said go show yourselves to the priest now that was an act in that cleansing ceremony that where they were to go and and and and let the priest pronounce them clean you see what had happened though word had already been spoken and the word itself packs the power to bring the cleansing to that life it held the authority to take where cells themselves were in such a rotten in of vile condition but the word would bring order to that life the war the word would actually reverse the course of death and leprosy in that life and turn it around he never he never even said you be thou whole he said go show yourselves to the priests because the word itself as the Bible said God sent His Word to heal his people so it is the Word of God that is just like you know when brother Branham would tell us in power transformation and I believe it's very much a key even for the hour we're living in brother Graham would talk about he said sometimes even the person or the vessel he said maybe that has preached that word or delivered that word he said it was never that vessel that transforms you it is the word he said see it even shows even in that situation it is the word that does the transformation it's not the man who does the preaching it is the word that does the transformation so we know it all brings our confidence back in the word and I'm grateful for that aren't you he says go show yourselves under the priest and it shall come to pass it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed they had they had to obey the word their hearts just immediately when it was spoken by the way they went and in their obedience the simple obedience just to accept what was already said it's finished they were cleansed has they obeyed from their heart they were cleansed as they went on their way and the Bible says that man one of them verse 15 and one of them when he saw that he was healed he took not he just didn't know the rest of them knew they were cleansed but he took knowledge of the healing in his body and it was something about it that was more than the rest or the other nine the other nine it wasn't that you know they weren't glad about it but for him he took knowledge of the and the greatness of what it take place in his life you know how it is sometimes you know and maybe a person can just come and they you know when things start going bad in their life oh they want Jesus but but after things start going good then they forget about Jesus they they um they you know they'll come to church when things are going bad or having a but we're having a hard time where it's a good place to come but it ain't only the time you come when you're having a hard time you you come here in the times when you're on top of the mountain you come here in the times when you're in the valley in the lowest Valley but in it all we recognize in our life it is Jesus Christ that has brought healing to our lives if it wasn't for him we would still be without the camp but because of the blood of Jesus Christ it has already been shed for us and the Holy Spirit went to us and said you can come in now you are brought in there is a cleansing that is went for you to change the course of what was leprosy in your soul now we are pronounced clean by the blood of the Lamb oh I'm so glad about that I told you I'm just gonna just just pick just a few moments but I don't want to get too wound up here on this but it's so hard on any part of the Word of God not to get wound up you know in the good the Lord the word of the Lord is so good it's so rich because this is this is about me this about you a man if not for the grace of God we were only looking into the village we didn't even as Gentiles we didn't even have the promises of the covenants and of the adoption we were on the outside looking in but here he said here when we came when he came there's something about it in us like the woman who had the issue of blood it was just like than when they if I can just touch the hem of His garment I shall be made whole it was just like the one that you know could could look at there and say that son of David you know have mercy on me blind bartimaeus caught who he was and it released to him the reality of who he was and the effect upon his life his eyes were healed and to think about the woman who you know had the daughter at home she you know here she approached she was agreed she said thou son of David and Jesus said to her he said it is not meet to take the the bread and give it unto dogs see at present remember when Jesus came as the Messiah it was not unto the Gentiles at that time it was coming the Bible says he came to confirm the promises that were made unto the circumcision but when he came they rejected him but think of this woman does not even meet for him to take the bread intact cast it to dogs but what did she do she said but Lord does not the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table Jesus put it out here and dogs and she even got Lord she submitted herself to the word and you know brother Ram was taken he said now how many of you in here tonight he said you you would you take a crumb he said or do you have to have a slice he said but if you can take a crumb ease and Jesus is after crumb seekers because you can take a crumb he said you've got everything that's in the whole loaf and you know brother promise will come to pass amen oh my to humble ourselves to the word you know to think of this Jesus he never when he looked at their condition they were in leprosy but Jesus was able to who had Mabel to move and call them into where they needed to be look at this he says when they and one fell down the one of them when he saw that he was healed he turned back and with a loud voice glorified God he didn't send Jesus a text he didn't send Jesus a tweet he didn't even send Jesus a thumbs up I like it on Facebook he let it be known with the loud voice he glorified God because he knew there is no one that could do this but Almighty God he was confident that God was in Christ that's how it is in this generation it's confident that God has made himself real through his word of promise in this generation like brother Paul was singing I wanna thank you for letting me see this last day mystery and to know that my name is on the book they meant the seals they have been revealed and and my name is found there it's to reveal you are always with me your name your life was always secure you know it behooves us to look at that and to consider look he looked at his healing and he realized hey this is tremendous what God has done and he returned back to glorify God oh my I believe I'm talking to people tonight that do that I believe I'm talking to people and I flew like me and like this were lepers but the grace of God were spoke to our hearts and we can see in our life I once was a leper but I've been healed amen I watched what's without the camp but now through him by the blood of Jesus I've been brought nigh amen and when he saw that he was healed he turned back and and with a loud voice glorified God and fell down on his face at his feet giving him things I think that's tremendous he just didn't he gave him things it was you know and a giving of things there's times we say thank you there stand and sometimes I I think we all can agree thank you so many times when we when it comes to speaking expressing it to the Lord you don't even feel like that that's that's enough words sometimes I said Lord forgive me but all I can say it only thing I got vocabulary is thank you but from my heart you you you know what my heart is saying I'm so grateful for your grace Lord and for your mercy Lord for what you've done he fell on his face at his feet giving him things and I like this and he was in verse 16 a Samaritan you see sometimes it's necessary to know the background we know not everybody the people don't have to know our background but it's important this would be included that this was a Samaritan this is one who was looked down on then was looked as an outcast it was everything but Jesus let it be known he was a Samaritan he returned and gave things he wasn't somebody born with a silver spoon in his mouth as Gentiles we were not born with a silver spoon in our mouth we did not know anything about the covenants but God knew about us mm-hmm and Jesus said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto Him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole there's just so many so many wonderful things within the Word of God that it deals with in our lives of giving things and so many things that was we find in God's Word and I'm not going to I'm not going to read it but it's just so many things that are even right here before me of where God admonishes us through Apostle Paul and and and different ones to give things David would write about even his expression and giving thanks unto the Lord because in every part of our life even in being able to wake up in your right mind we ought to say thank you Lord you you here and you've walked through another day in Satan's Eden thank you lord his grace has kept you he's given you strength when when when you felt that you were at the lowest yet he come and encouraged you thank you Lord he's provided when we didn't know which way to turn thank you Lord in all of these things of how that God's still moving word and transforming lives thank your Lord how that God has come in the midst of the test and of the trial it not to remove the tester trial but just to let us know hey what I said in the beginning then I'll never leave you no forsake you I am with you even to the end of the age I'm in it I'm here I've always been here whether you felt it or not I'm here with you thank you Lord amen growl repeat Oh God thank you Lord Jesus I'm glad that he's with me aren't you glad he's with you even when I don't feel him even when the circumstances are not circumstances then I feel like shouting but he's still with me over and over I tell you I got a little beside myself when I we were over there and right before administered it brother Jim Shumate sit on that net that's Sunday night and the Lord just began to turn my direction back in the office on that Sunday evening and I started to preach on on Joseph in and dealing with some of the some of those parts within Joseph and tests and trials and and you know how God just put all that together and I begin to look at things in the scripture and you find over and over in the scripture the Bible says the Lord when he went into prison the Bible says the Lord was with him when he went into the lowest dungeon the Bible says the Lord was with him I don't believe those things are just mentioned neither does God want us just to well you know you just you just you just know that just that's a given God had that wrote in the book of Genesis chapter 39 for Samuel Browning for 2019 he had it wrote there so that I could look at it that even no matter what situation is to know that he said in his word I'll never leave you nor forsake you when you're even in a situation that doesn't look pleasant it doesn't look good you don't feel like shopping but I am with you you let us know I'm with you aren't you glad about that thank you lord thank you lord all we got so much to thank God for and like the the the you know the lepers that returned back the one that came back oh my we've got so much to thank God for thank God for his if he tarries here's another year that the Lord would will have brought us through and many tests many trials that he has he has is once again proven his faithfulness his mercy once again amen so much how Paul you know what say but I'm not going to take any more time because I want to give a time for for testimonies and I know there may be some songs to be sung and then I want to read the prayer requests we may do them just a little different but I want to to also do that as well tonight amen then won't you go ahead and come on to the piano here I want to remember last time we had prayer meeting here and I'll just give this testimony my aunt Marcellus she was really suffering with a lot of pain they had taken her into that's my mom's oldest I think our oldest sister maybe not the oldest but anyhow they are taking her in for for back pain in and one of her legs was actually from all the pain being drawn up and then they had to straighten and pull that leg out and she was in such pain and but it was just really bad but the testimony is that comes and my mom wanted to make sure that I gave this today and that was is that she she's completely she's improved there's no pain she just been doing well and had she's just been getting rest and been been sleeping and and you know just getting rest and things like that and she's she's a real active my aunt Marcela but you know that right there was just so thankful to the Lord because it was very serious when they called us because that like that that pain from her back she she told her daughter's she said if they can't do anything she said I just want the Lord at me I can't take this pain and she said it's just just so painful you know and in her back so I'd like to we have a we have some prayer requests and what we'll do we'll just take these all

it was the last prayer meeting that we had I brought it before the church just to keep me in prayer it was about two weeks before the wedding that I started having these dizzy spells and any fast kind of head movement I'd get dizzy I bend down to pick something up and I'll get dizzy I mean just even going down the stairs at work I'm looking where I'm going and then the minute I pick up I head to open the door it kind of gets black in front of me and I grab ahold of something but the worst part of it is when I go to bed at night and I turn from one side to the next that's when it feels like I'm gonna on a rollercoaster ride like I get real real dizzy and it just disturbed my sleep and I was really uncomfortable and I mentioned that at work people at work say that yeah it's vertigo and they know people that go through the similar thing and they have to get a checked out and I just got really scared and I and I knew that I was praying and I claimed my healing but I I was I was so fearful at the same time and I know that faith moves mountains but fear brings that mountain back and I knew that I needed help from the believers I needed someone to stand with me and believe with me and I came and I I mentioned it before the church we prayed and that night I went home and there was no disease spells then I went to bed and I moved from one side to the next it didn't feel like I was on a roller coaster ride no more and I got up the next morning and I praise God and I worshiped him and I sang at work and I was so happy and then just like you know what the enemy would come around didn't someone asks our house that pretty gogo key and and I was I was taken because I almost like I forgot that I even told them and like what Bertie going didn't you just a couple of weeks told us about this pretty girl you have I did oh yeah yeah yeah well I I actually asked the church to pray for me and I believe the Lord gave me such a of course they look at you like you're talking a foreign language I they said oh no no but vertigo works in intervals it comes and it goes sometimes for a week sometimes it stays away for a month even yours I know someone that had it and it been gone for years and then it came back and it's it's like all of a sudden it feels like someone just hit your wind you know like your your breath gets taken away and I'm like oh God and again I got so
