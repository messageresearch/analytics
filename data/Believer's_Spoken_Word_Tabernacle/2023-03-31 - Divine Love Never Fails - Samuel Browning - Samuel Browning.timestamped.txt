[32:29] just to staying in your presence Lord
[32:34] there's just Lord there's nothing like
[32:37] your presence Lord
[32:40] because it's when we get into your
[32:42] presence
[32:44] that we really lose sight of ourselves
[32:46] Lord
[32:48] we see Lord like Moses as he stood there
[32:51] that day in the presence
[32:54] of that burning bush it was your
[32:57] presence Lord
[32:59] that where the bush itself was on fire
[33:02] but yet it was not consumed
[33:07] that everything every reason all of his
[33:10] human weaknesses
[33:13] were Lord exposed in that moment
[33:19] Lord
[33:20] it's in your presence like there with
[33:22] Moses
[33:25] that God had calls us to surrender it's
[33:27] causes us to see
[33:30] our littleness and the greatness of the
[33:33] need that we have Lord in you
[33:36] now Lord It's in recognizing your
[33:39] presence that the desires that are upon
[33:41] our hearts Lord that's what your
[33:43] presence sweeping by Lord it begins to
[33:46] stir up those desires Lord that has been
[33:49] placed on the inside and oh God when we
[33:52] can just recognize your presence and
[33:55] just let go Lord to what you are
[33:58] declaring oh God and how that you are
[34:00] moving Lord then whatever that we have
[34:02] need of and the desire that is in our
[34:05] life Lord you will take us to it Lord
[34:08] and father right here tonight Lord
[34:11] we invite you Lord
[34:14] Lord this
[34:16] this gathering tonight would be no more
[34:18] than that
[34:20] without your presence Lord
[34:23] we invite you tonight Lord that you
[34:26] would be so personal Lord that you would
[34:29] come Lord and minister in such a
[34:31] personal way to our lives Lord
[34:34] help us together to step out of the way
[34:37] that you can have the right of way that
[34:39] hearts and lives Lord would Lord just be
[34:41] moved deeper in you Lord there'd be a
[34:44] deeper surrender and consecration Lord
[34:46] from our hearts the Lord I pray
[34:49] may you come Lord and do only what you
[34:53] can do Lord no man can do this Lord no
[34:56] man can take us Lord across that line
[34:59] Lord between Time and Eternity no one
[35:02] Lord can do for us Lord what you can do
[35:04] Lord now father we ask that you would
[35:07] help us and give us the grace Lord
[35:09] that's needed in this moment to be able
[35:12] to step aside that you might be exalted
[35:15] Lord and that you might come on the
[35:17] scene Lord and that our faith would rise
[35:19] in you Lord God for lord it's in you
[35:22] that did his unlimited it is impossible
[35:26] Lord
[35:27] and you've only asked us if thou canst
[35:30] believe
[35:32] granted Lord tonight
[35:35] [Music]
[35:36] we love you and we thank you Father

[37:35] to the Lord in prayer and um
[37:37] so let's just read here in job 22 and um
[37:43] we'll read just the two scriptures we've
[37:46] been reading from this here quite some
[37:47] time and then we'll go right into some
[37:49] other scriptures but in job 22 and verse
[37:52] 2 remember this is one of the friends of
[37:56] of job that is asking a question and you
[37:59] know his the question is deals with the
[38:02] limited understanding and of the
[38:04] relationship that he would have with God
[38:08] and verse 2 he says can a man be
[38:10] profitable unto God as he that is wise
[38:14] may be profitable
[38:17] unto himself
[38:19] and I would say as we have been saying
[38:22] yes and no
[38:23] that God's desire is to use man
[38:27] not for man to use God
[38:32] and I I believe that that's God's desire
[38:34] is God God's whole purpose is to get a
[38:37] hold of us and work through us
[38:41] and not for us to take a hold and try to
[38:44] do it but let him do what he wants to do
[38:48] and that in itself is a paradox that's a
[38:51] paradox so may God bless the reading of
[38:53] the word as you're being seated I want
[38:55] to just make an announcement here that
[38:57] Lord willing this coming Sunday
[39:00] afternoon at 4 pm Now we move that back
[39:03] and the reason I had it at five before
[39:06] is because
[39:07] when my wife and they have to leave out
[39:11] of here real quick and to go make that
[39:13] communion bread so I mean and they were
[39:15] running it right to the wire when we had
[39:17] it at five
[39:18] so communion and foot washing and um
[39:24] if everything goes as is on Sunday
[39:26] morning I have some things on my heart
[39:27] that would kind of share around that
[39:30] and I want to just say we had I know my
[39:35] wife had posted it on Facebook or with
[39:38] regarding to Sister Connie Jenkins and
[39:41] her passing some of you may not
[39:44] know Sister Connie or remember Sister
[39:46] Connie Jenkins but sister Connie Jenkins
[39:48] was very much a part of this assembly
[39:51] here for many many years as a matter of
[39:54] fact she and the three granddaughters
[39:57] that she was Raising of her own they
[40:00] actually begin coming to the church when
[40:02] I was actually away
[40:04] playing ball there in college and before
[40:06] the Lord had got to hold my life and so
[40:09] there was a many that had known her from
[40:12] you know even in the past and uh and she
[40:15] was here sister Connie was one who was
[40:17] very very very faithful Among Us she was
[40:20] here like clockwork on midweek service
[40:23] and the and Sunday service she was one
[40:25] that if you didn't see her you knew
[40:27] something's wrong
[40:29] you know and that's kind of Christian
[40:30] you want to be you know you don't want
[40:32] to be where somebody where you're not
[40:34] missed and you would say well why would
[40:36] somebody not miss me well you know I
[40:37] know we can say well I stream but I
[40:39] don't see you streaming nobody else sees
[40:42] you streaming and I'm not saying that to
[40:43] probe any I'm just saying the realities
[40:45] of it is that sometimes you know if when
[40:48] when you're not here then you know we do
[40:50] miss you but if it's something you know
[40:52] like I said with sister Connie and I I
[40:54] think let me just go back and pull from
[40:57] the one I remember brother Cadre Diggs
[40:59] when he was here you know about seven
[41:01] years ago and he made a statement he
[41:03] said if if you're not here and people
[41:05] don't miss you he said then something's
[41:07] wrong with your experience
[41:10] is that right and it's true
[41:12] amen forgive me brother Cadre for using
[41:15] you but uh it's very true you know and I
[41:17] think about that my you know we we want
[41:20] to be very much a viable part you know
[41:21] and so sister Connie was that and so the
[41:24] Lord
[41:25] was gracious to us and we was there on
[41:28] Monday and Tuesday and just spoke the
[41:32] funeral there on Tuesday afternoon and
[41:35] just took a little thought on what is
[41:37] cherished the most and so you don't know
[41:41] what what all the Lord has done and um
[41:44] you know I spoke very plainly in the in
[41:47] the service as I believe we at the times
[41:49] of God gives Grace but I I told him I
[41:51] said hey I'm speaking plain but I know
[41:54] that's how she is Sister Connie spoke
[41:56] plain and I said but most of all I know
[41:59] he's happy about it uh because you know
[42:01] I believe there's a time that you know
[42:04] we have to have a reflection on our soul
[42:07] and uh and I believe that's a good thing
[42:09] to have that reflection and really see
[42:11] what do we really cherish the most you
[42:13] can you can cherish your job cherish
[42:15] your family but if you don't Cherish The
[42:18] Old Rugged Cross then you've missed the
[42:21] wrong thing
[42:22] and so that was her favorite song and
[42:24] the Lord just gave that inspiration
[42:25] there early in the morning on chair on
[42:28] that from that that refrain of that that
[42:30] that uh song on the word cherish and so
[42:33] we just spoke on that for a few moments
[42:35] and uh I I just um you know I just just
[42:39] asked that you just continue to pray for
[42:41] the family and different ones because
[42:43] they've been here at different times
[42:45] there was also a young lady that came up
[42:47] to us
[42:49] um afterwards that found me or
[42:50] afterwards wanted to know she said I'm
[42:52] new into the area and she said I'm
[42:54] looking for a church and she said I need
[42:56] to know where the church is at so you
[42:58] don't know what you don't know the only
[43:00] thing we know is we cast The Bread upon
[43:02] the water and if there's a seed that is
[43:04] there then you know it'll respond you
[43:06] know into that in into that life so we
[43:09] don't know and um but I also want to
[43:12] make an announcement here I don't want
[43:13] to prolong the time but there there is a
[43:17] need and I know that you no doubt you
[43:19] really don't know this couple or family
[43:21] but they do stream and they are located
[43:24] in in Cleveland in a in a place the
[43:27] sister was here one service and it's
[43:30] been at least has it been a year ago
[43:32] brother Richard
[43:35] a little bit less than a year and so she
[43:38] was here and she's from Congo as well
[43:41] and so she has um
[43:44] she's her and her and um
[43:48] brother chance they're over there and
[43:51] when Brother Richard and sister Maria
[43:52] just trying to reach out to her because
[43:54] they're not able to get here and
[43:58] um it just the circumstances that I
[44:00] can't go into Brother Richard could go
[44:01] into even more but they have it's very
[44:04] difficult she I don't know if she can
[44:06] drive or not I don't remember all the
[44:07] details but this is what it comes down
[44:09] to Brother Richard and sister Maria have
[44:11] still you know just going out because
[44:14] his sister Angeline just
[44:17] really to you know streaming into the
[44:19] services and them listening in so it
[44:22] reached out and just just wanting to
[44:24] just make contact with her and I really
[44:26] appreciate that and so uh they went and
[44:30] and they saw where they were living and
[44:32] they saw the need and and brother
[44:34] Richard you know he he he called me and
[44:37] I was actually in getting ready to go
[44:38] into a meeting there in Alabama and he
[44:40] had forgot all about it and I said hey
[44:42] that's no problem but I just assure you
[44:43] when Brother Richard called me he was
[44:45] just his heart and uh with seeing the
[44:49] situation where they absolutely had
[44:51] nothing
[44:52] um the only thing that they're covered
[44:54] up with is curtains that they had from
[44:56] the previous house and um it's a very
[44:59] very hard situation and they didn't ask
[45:02] for anything but when Brother Richard
[45:04] came away from there these are some of
[45:07] the needs and I know there's been things
[45:08] taken there already
[45:10] but it's just needs for some things this
[45:12] furniture and I I've made a copy of this
[45:14] that Brother Richard wrote down you can
[45:17] see him you can see sister Maria it's
[45:19] posted in each of the bathrooms now what
[45:22] has been wrote down in there's certain
[45:23] things a full or queen-sized bed dresser
[45:27] sofa couch small kitchen table with four
[45:30] chairs and this is it whether you know
[45:32] or you know someone because a lot of
[45:34] times we spread out and and I know
[45:36] sometimes you find things Facebook
[45:37] Marketplace or probably you have
[45:39] neighbors you know that do some things
[45:41] like that as well you know diapers and
[45:45] things like that see see um also for um
[45:48] some of the um for the children there's
[45:50] a one-year-old a two-year-old and
[45:52] there's one on the way is that correct
[45:53] so you see sister Maria for the sizes
[45:56] and you know if there's a crib or a
[45:58] mattress so you don't have to remember
[45:59] all this it's it's there on the bulletin
[46:02] board but
[46:03] um this is something right now that if
[46:06] we if if you know of someone because
[46:08] sometimes we always have family members
[46:10] or somebody that you know at work or
[46:11] whatever you know sometimes people ask
[46:12] and say hey I've got this is uh is there
[46:15] anything anybody want this or to get rid
[46:17] of it and and so just so you know and
[46:20] you can always say hey yeah well there's
[46:22] can you hold on to that and then we can
[46:24] get to it and get it over to them so is
[46:26] that okay
[46:28] so with just uh Brother Richard and
[46:30] sister Maria and you can you can see
[46:32] them and like I said it's posted there
[46:33] in the um in the restrooms and I really
[46:36] appreciate them looking in on that
[46:39] and um I want to just take a little
[46:41] thought here tonight and um I'm not
[46:44] really I know I won't get probably
[46:47] finished with it but I want to just
[46:49] continuing on that thought of a useful
[46:51] life but to be more punctual and more
[46:53] direct I want to just uh focus on this
[46:56] and that is divine Love Never Fails
[47:00] because we want to be useful a useful
[47:04] life and I want to just take that on how
[47:06] Divine love never fails in second
[47:08] Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 14 Paul
[47:12] says For the Love of Christ
[47:14] constraineth us because we thus judged
[47:18] that if one died for all then we're all
[47:22] dead and that he died for all that they
[47:25] which live should not henceforth live
[47:28] unto themselves but unto him which died
[47:33] for them and rose again and I want to
[47:36] just draw upon that out of the um in
[47:39] verse 14 and I want to just read it out
[47:41] of the Amplified version so I don't have
[47:43] to just completely define it but for the
[47:45] love of Christ constrainteth us and that
[47:48] it could constrain it means to control
[47:51] uh controls and urges and impels us so
[47:55] we are not being moved by our own love
[47:59] because that love will fail we can love
[48:03] God in our mind in our spirit and that
[48:06] only lasts so long
[48:08] but when the love of God has come down
[48:11] to that of the soul and it brings a real
[48:15] transformation
[48:17] then our lives are not regulated or
[48:21] lived out by reasoning but it becomes
[48:24] like a spring that's bubbling up and
[48:27] when that spring bubbles up that the
[48:30] spring itself like when brother Branham
[48:32] asked it what makes you Bubble Up is it
[48:35] the deer and all these other things is
[48:37] it because I come to drink from you it
[48:39] said no there is a force that's behind
[48:42] me that's pushing me and that's what the
[48:46] love of Christ moves within a life it
[48:49] controls us it urges us and it impels us
[48:53] so it moves us and I'm grateful that
[48:56] there is a force behind you and I and
[49:00] it's really it's the same force behind
[49:02] you and I if we can think about it the
[49:06] same love of God which is the Holy Ghost
[49:08] ghost which is the deity of almighty God
[49:11] inside of your eye that is the same one
[49:14] who stepped back in the beginning and
[49:16] said let there be so there is the
[49:20] creative power that resides in the heart
[49:24] of the believer and it is the love of
[49:26] God I need some more in these monitors
[49:28] please it's the love of God that resides
[49:31] within our heart that controls and urges
[49:34] and impels us now in Philippians chapter
[49:36] 2 verse 1 and I'm just moving to get to
[49:39] a place if there be any consolation now
[49:42] Paul is speaking to the body of
[49:45] Believers if there be any consolation in
[49:48] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[49:52] Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels
[49:55] and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you
[49:59] be like-minded having the same love
[50:03] being of one Accord and of one mind so
[50:06] Paul in verse 1 is saying if any of this
[50:09] is going to be this is the requirements
[50:13] oh that there would be a fulfillment of
[50:15] my joy now what Joy is Paul talking
[50:18] about Paul's not talking about his own
[50:21] Joy but he is talking about the joy of
[50:23] the Lord that has become a part of his
[50:26] life and the joy of the Lord is the
[50:28] strength of my life and that to be
[50:30] like-minded to be where we are in equal
[50:34] and so where our lives have been
[50:36] transformed and to have the same love
[50:39] being of one according to one mind
[50:41] that's the only way that these other
[50:43] parts in verse 1 can actually Operate
[50:46] Now notice in verse 3 let nothing be
[50:49] done through Strife or vain Glory that
[50:53] actually deals with not putting oneself
[50:56] first but in loneliness of Mind Let each
[50:59] esteem other better than themselves look
[51:04] not every man on his own things but
[51:07] every man also on the things of others
[51:11] and let this mind be in you which was
[51:15] also in Christ Jesus now brother Brandon
[51:18] I've been reading from this quote and I
[51:20] I because it's been a few weeks since we
[51:22] had dealt with this and I want to go
[51:24] back in to read this to lay a course
[51:26] here this evening brother Rambo says
[51:29] Jesus never lived for himself and I
[51:32] think that that speaks for itself in
[51:34] scripture he never had a Bentley his
[51:36] head on he said you know the foxes have
[51:39] dens but the son of man doesn't even
[51:42] have a place to lay his head to think
[51:44] about of everything he had many rights
[51:47] but he forsook all of those rights for
[51:50] you and I in order to redeem you and I
[51:53] now the reason and I want you let me
[51:56] just go ahead and read the rest of it
[51:58] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[52:01] was spent for others and that's
[52:04] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[52:07] go to church and you do good things
[52:09] that's fine but when you live your life
[52:12] to yourself you haven't good you have an
[52:14] eternal life now you might think well
[52:16] that's that's um uh a contradictory you
[52:19] do good things and how could I be living
[52:21] my life to myself it depends on what's
[52:23] the motive that you're doing it for
[52:26] that's why Paul could say no I could
[52:29] speak in tongues though I could prophesy
[52:31] though I can know all the Mysteries
[52:32] though I give my good Goods to the poor
[52:35] though I sacrifice of my body if it is
[52:38] not there with Charity in my life it
[52:42] profiteth nothing
[52:45] right in other words it would be like
[52:47] you going and putting seemingly money in
[52:49] the account and the bank says there's
[52:51] not been any deposit
[52:54] are you hearing me so what is it that is
[52:57] to motivate govern and direct the Church
[53:00] of the Living God is the love of God
[53:03] because without God's love if you take
[53:06] God's love out of the equation we
[53:08] wouldn't even be here tonight
[53:10] it's the love of God that reached down
[53:13] for you and I that produce a savior for
[53:16] you and I It produced a blood cell that
[53:19] could pay the debt for our sins
[53:22] there's not enough Good Deeds that you
[53:25] and I could do we could never be good
[53:27] enough to ever pay the price
[53:30] God produced a blood cell
[53:34] amen that it might be a remitting of sin
[53:37] that that life in that blood cell God's
[53:39] own life could come back upon the
[53:42] worshiper could draw us back into a real
[53:45] Union with him
[53:48] eternal life
[53:49] is living for others
[53:52] it proved that when he come the Lamb of
[53:54] in the Lamb of God he lived and had
[53:57] eternal life because he did not live for
[54:00] himself
[54:01] he lived for others and you receive
[54:04] eternal life by receiving that day and
[54:07] you don't live for yourself no more you
[54:10] live for others and someone said now
[54:12] here's one of the ways we live for
[54:14] others someone said how can you stand
[54:16] and let anybody call you such bad names
[54:18] because you don't live for yourself
[54:21] you live for others that you might
[54:24] redeem that man
[54:26] so the man the person that's calling you
[54:28] the names you could live for yourself
[54:31] you could sock his lights out
[54:35] in the name of Jesus I I you know I fled
[54:37] you to death
[54:39] but that's not living for that's you
[54:41] that's me right that's about me
[54:45] right because you can remember the Bible
[54:47] saying and all you do in word or deed do
[54:49] it all in the name of Jesus Christ if
[54:52] you can't in the name of Jesus then
[54:54] don't pout
[54:56] preach brother Samuel
[54:58] if you can't give somebody the silent
[55:01] treatment in the name of Jesus then
[55:02] don't give them a silent treatment
[55:07] come on now you know all you do in word
[55:09] or deed
[55:11] now unless your Bible
[55:13] has your translation to it
[55:16] you know the new living beneath and
[55:19] below my privileges version
[55:21] you know how they got the nltv zv and
[55:24] whatever but I don't want them but I
[55:25] don't want to be a part of the new
[55:27] living beneath my privileges I want to
[55:29] live in the grace of God I I've Got
[55:31] Confidence that God's grace produces in
[55:34] our life what's needed what I can't do
[55:36] and what is absolutely against my human
[55:39] nature there is a divine nature to give
[55:43] me strength to subdue that
[55:47] you live for others that you might
[55:49] redeem that man how you become Sons
[55:53] and the trouble of it is the church has
[55:56] forgot they were Sons
[56:00] you're a son now the greatest way that
[56:02] you remember you're a son is not so much
[56:04] it's all together teaching it's it's him
[56:07] expressing what you and I are to be
[56:11] I'm telling you God has done that in
[56:13] this generation
[56:14] God is still continuing to do that
[56:16] listen this right here there's no
[56:19] greater expression of this even in our
[56:21] homes
[56:23] preach with me now
[56:24] there's no bread where do children learn
[56:27] to forgive not at school
[56:30] where did children
[56:33] will not at work
[56:37] and not Mom and Daddy going and hunting
[56:39] them down there I'm going to find out
[56:41] who the principal is in them and who
[56:43] this is because I am going to give them
[56:45] a piece of my mind be careful you might
[56:48] give away all your mind
[56:51] that's a direct quote from Brother John
[56:53] LaFontaine
[56:54] is that right though sometimes we you
[56:58] know that this is where things are
[57:00] expressed that's why it's example in God
[57:02] in this hour he didn't give us a picture
[57:04] of an eagle an eagle came flying over
[57:08] almighty God came over where you and I
[57:10] were at that's what got our attention
[57:12] not a good teaching of an eagle
[57:16] but it was the eagle himself Jehovah God
[57:20] yeah
[57:21] and the trouble of it is the church has
[57:24] forgotten they were Sons you're a son
[57:26] you're taking Christ's place you're a
[57:28] son so don't live for yourself live for
[57:30] others what brother Branham I can live
[57:33] for this brother because he sure is a
[57:35] nice man
[57:36] we all can do that
[57:38] right sometimes what contributes let me
[57:41] ask you something what contributes
[57:43] sometimes to a nice man or a nice woman
[57:45] what is it
[57:47] oh well they never said anything bad to
[57:49] me never said no what it comes down to
[57:51] is is there's certain personalities I
[57:54] don't care how full of the Holy Ghost
[57:55] you are there are certain personalities
[57:57] you click with and there's other
[57:59] personalities you don't
[58:02] so what do I do don't try to change
[58:04] nobody's personality because God didn't
[58:09] hello somebody
[58:12] it ain't personality God ain't
[58:14] interested in changing people's
[58:15] personalities he made you the way he
[58:17] made you it only takes the Holy Ghost to
[58:20] come down on the inside that'll order
[58:22] that personality bring that life in
[58:24] subjection and will mold that character
[58:26] but God's got a purpose in it
[58:31] what should I do find you another good
[58:34] close buddy friend
[58:35] hello somebody
[58:39] man I know this is real simple but it's
[58:41] true
[58:43] right
[58:45] I mean it's just the truth live for that
[58:48] man who hates you live for that person
[58:50] who would kill you if they could
[58:53] but we probably need water bottles to
[58:55] swallow this one down tonight
[58:57] that's what they've done to him they
[59:00] killed him and he died that he might
[59:02] save them
[59:04] that's eternal life when that's in your
[59:07] bosom you're facing heaven then
[59:10] but you sacrifice your own things you
[59:12] give them up like sheep gives the wool
[59:16] now let me just
[59:18] say it in this way as we look at second
[59:20] II Thessalonians chapter 3.
[59:23] it's it is us becoming one with the
[59:26] sacrifice through the sacrificing of our
[59:29] will there's no other way
[59:31] for the Holy Ghost to come they're not
[59:34] sacrificing our will
[59:37] when the lamb said nevertheless not my
[59:40] will thine will be done there's no other
[59:43] way it has to be a sacrificing a
[59:46] surrendering to the will of God
[59:50] that's what Jacob that's what the
[59:52] wrestling was all about Jacob
[59:54] surrendering to the will of God
[59:57] that's what it was all about that's why
[59:59] God as he deals with the life it's God
[1:00:01] wanting to bring that life in surrender
[1:00:03] God will never and he never does
[1:00:06] overpower anybody
[1:00:08] God doesn't do that
[1:00:10] the Holy Spirit can overwhelm you
[1:00:13] the grace of God comes to you but it is
[1:00:16] not there to overpower you because in
[1:00:19] order for the new birth to take place
[1:00:21] there has to be a surrendering of our
[1:00:26] will
[1:00:29] sometimes that may take a long time with
[1:00:32] the wrestling out and it's not because
[1:00:34] somebody's more but you know in God's
[1:00:36] weaker sometimes we're just more
[1:00:38] hard-headed and stubborn than maybe
[1:00:40] something else and God let me tell you
[1:00:42] something you can't outrun God
[1:00:46] that's Hallelujah he said your names is
[1:00:48] written in the palm of my hand you can't
[1:00:50] outrun God God knows how to bring us to
[1:00:53] a place to where will is broken
[1:00:58] and we're willing to surrender
[1:01:02] hmm
[1:01:03] so it leads us once that has taken place
[1:01:06] it leads us to a sacrificial life which
[1:01:09] that's really what the whole Christian
[1:01:10] life is about is sacrifice
[1:01:14] and you know in order to think about it
[1:01:16] now we are called to be as Paul would
[1:01:18] write a Living Sacrifice
[1:01:22] and ongoing sacrifice
[1:01:29] that's where we need a lot of help in
[1:01:30] Jesus
[1:01:32] because there's times where we got to
[1:01:34] sacrifice our own will like who
[1:01:37] this needs to be said like that and oh
[1:01:40] man and then oh they said this to me or
[1:01:43] this but you've got to sacrifice your
[1:01:45] own will
[1:01:48] are you hearing me that's an ongoing
[1:01:50] thing
[1:01:51] to sacrifice our will to the will of
[1:01:54] almighty God now let me tell you
[1:01:56] something it isn't all together right
[1:01:57] here because you might keep everything
[1:01:59] locked in right here and it's bottled up
[1:02:02] right here and if it stays right here
[1:02:03] it'll send you to hell
[1:02:06] you can't have art and Grudge in your
[1:02:09] heart against nobody
[1:02:12] from the same year they wiped their feet
[1:02:14] on me you have no right
[1:02:17] are you hearing me preaching out
[1:02:19] I'm all the way through the Bible the
[1:02:22] Lord Jesus stood right there and when
[1:02:24] they had come at him they had beat him
[1:02:26] they had put the crown of thorns on his
[1:02:29] head and he stood there and said father
[1:02:31] forgive them they don't know what
[1:02:34] they're doing
[1:02:36] brother I believe that's a testimony of
[1:02:39] every son and daughter of God that's
[1:02:41] what the Holy Ghost produces in a life I
[1:02:44] tell you tonight if you never got to
[1:02:46] that place where you can forgive
[1:02:47] somebody and really get down in your
[1:02:50] heart and pray for it you need the love
[1:02:52] of God in your heart
[1:02:54] oh I know the message I ain't talking
[1:02:56] about the message I'm talking about the
[1:02:58] Holy Ghost
[1:02:59] you can know the message back and forth
[1:03:02] but if you don't got the love of God in
[1:03:04] your heart to get down when somebody has
[1:03:06] wronged you and prayed for them with a
[1:03:09] real sincerity you need the baptism of
[1:03:12] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:14] whoo
[1:03:16] my my a lot of freebies huh
[1:03:20] it's like getting in the Cracker Jack
[1:03:21] box and you've realized there's more
[1:03:22] than just two of those water soaked
[1:03:24] tattoos
[1:03:28] you got to be willing to sacrifice our
[1:03:30] will now watch this second Thessalonians
[1:03:33] chapter 3 verse 4. and Paul said we have
[1:03:36] confidence in the Lord touching you that
[1:03:40] ye both do and will do the things which
[1:03:44] we command you now watch and the Lord
[1:03:47] direct your hearts into the love of God
[1:03:52] and into the patient waiting for Christ
[1:03:56] now notice the Lord direct your hearts
[1:03:59] into
[1:04:00] the love of God and into the patient
[1:04:03] waiting for Christ so who is going to
[1:04:05] direct our hearts
[1:04:06] the Lord
[1:04:09] is that right now God has many Avenues
[1:04:12] God has his word right we can be reading
[1:04:15] here we are listening to the message
[1:04:18] right here is God comes right through
[1:04:20] his servants and the word can be spoken
[1:04:23] but it is God directing you and I
[1:04:26] leading you and I now watch this word
[1:04:28] direct I love this this word direct
[1:04:31] means to make straight to guide or
[1:04:34] direct and it deals with of the removal
[1:04:37] of the hindrances to coming to one
[1:04:41] so it's God removing
[1:04:45] leading us now notice it's not God
[1:04:47] removing the hindrances but it's God
[1:04:50] coming alongside of us and saying let's
[1:04:54] deal with this
[1:04:56] I love in the Song of Solomon song with
[1:04:58] Solomon Chapter 2 where he would talk
[1:05:00] about when it says let us take take us
[1:05:03] the foxes notice not take you but take
[1:05:06] us the foxes it's God coming
[1:05:10] exposing the little foxes and that's the
[1:05:13] time that God said come on let's take
[1:05:15] them on
[1:05:17] see it's not God just leaving you or not
[1:05:20] it's not us going out with our own will
[1:05:22] about trying to do something it's when
[1:05:25] God deals with our heart it's like a
[1:05:27] stream it's like a flow of the Holy
[1:05:29] Ghost when God is dealing with your
[1:05:31] heart get in the channel and move with
[1:05:34] it don't worry about if I can do this or
[1:05:37] I don't know if I'll be able to do this
[1:05:39] no get in the Stream Eagles themselves
[1:05:43] are patterned to find the source of that
[1:05:47] stream and that gust of air
[1:05:50] just just coming down Route Six on the
[1:05:52] way to church here and watch an eagle
[1:05:54] fly right right above you know our car
[1:05:56] and my goodness I just was trusting
[1:05:58] everyone a lot of traffic because I
[1:06:00] wanted to watch that fella
[1:06:02] but you see it you know they find they
[1:06:04] find that that they'll find those
[1:06:06] streams and I've watched them sometimes
[1:06:07] right over the house of where they'll
[1:06:09] come and you know and and they'll get
[1:06:11] right up then they'll start doing the
[1:06:13] circling and you find them where they
[1:06:14] find those streams and that's what you
[1:06:16] and I are meant to do we're meant to
[1:06:19] find those streams of God's grace
[1:06:22] that's where you and I were and you know
[1:06:24] an eagle don't have they're not up there
[1:06:26] when I watch them and then see them I've
[1:06:28] seen sometimes seen two of them and
[1:06:30] they're circling right around they're
[1:06:32] not flapping their wings at all they're
[1:06:35] simply sorry
[1:06:37] you see it's getting up there it's it's
[1:06:40] let taking the wings that God has given
[1:06:43] you and get away from the chatter of the
[1:06:45] devil chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:06:47] chatter chatter get on up into the
[1:06:49] heavenlies where there is streams of
[1:06:52] Grace that can do for you and move you
[1:06:55] from place to place
[1:06:57] now notice this
[1:06:59] in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse
[1:07:02] 31.
[1:07:06] Paul said but covet earnestly
[1:07:09] the best gifts
[1:07:11] and yet I show unto you
[1:07:15] a more excellent way
[1:07:20] now you realize you know the gifts
[1:07:23] themselves gifts and callings are
[1:07:24] without repentance
[1:07:27] they're there
[1:07:29] right it's just like every song leader a
[1:07:31] songwriter you know John Lennon and all
[1:07:35] them guys they'll give an account of the
[1:07:36] gift that late in their life of how they
[1:07:38] surrendered it
[1:07:40] how they surrender the gift in their
[1:07:42] life to influence others
[1:07:45] right now to think of this Paul was
[1:07:49] letting him know don't be Covetous of
[1:07:51] the gifts I want to show you something
[1:07:53] that is greater than all the gifts now
[1:07:56] Paul was not saying do away with the
[1:07:58] gifts
[1:07:59] it's like when brother Brown says that I
[1:08:01] believe in the Revelation series brother
[1:08:03] Brown tells us that the gifts themselves
[1:08:05] he had they been delivered to the church
[1:08:07] he said they have been put on the mantle
[1:08:09] like of the fireplace now he's not
[1:08:11] talking about decorations but it's like
[1:08:13] you know when my wife got the pots and
[1:08:15] pans you know from that a bridal shower
[1:08:18] she had to unpack them pots and pans
[1:08:21] they sat in a box for a few months you
[1:08:22] know uh in my bedroom there and waiting
[1:08:25] you know to for us to get married and
[1:08:27] and finally when we got into our place
[1:08:29] she unpacked them she put this pot here
[1:08:32] this pot here this pot here they were in
[1:08:35] the cabinet and when we needed the pot
[1:08:38] for spaghetti she didn't get out the
[1:08:39] saucer pan she got out what was needed
[1:08:42] to cook spaghetti when it was time for
[1:08:44] her and maybe boil some tea she didn't
[1:08:47] get out the big pot she got out the
[1:08:49] saucer pan or what was needed for gravy
[1:08:51] you say what are you saying I'm saying
[1:08:53] that when the gifts are in their place
[1:08:55] then God can use the spaghetti pot or
[1:08:57] prophecy or tongues into
[1:09:00] when he has need of it
[1:09:03] so in putting them on the mantle does
[1:09:05] not mean that they have been put away
[1:09:08] it's there and to be used as it's
[1:09:11] necessary so the use or non-use of the
[1:09:15] gift at a moment in a service does not
[1:09:18] dictate my victory in love divine
[1:09:23] right no more than I have to use a
[1:09:26] screwdriver every single day to feel
[1:09:27] Victorious I don't
[1:09:30] I'd appreciate if I don't have to use
[1:09:32] them much at all don't mind tools lock
[1:09:34] them in the toolbox
[1:09:36] notice yet Sean
[1:09:39] shots on it wait now notice I'm the show
[1:09:41] you so there is a a way that's being
[1:09:43] displayed now I'm
[1:09:45] Amplified I could read out of King James
[1:09:47] but like I said it'll just save me
[1:09:49] defining the words and allow me to move
[1:09:51] through this in First Corinthians 13 4
[1:09:53] out of the amplifier love this is what
[1:09:57] charity does now this is not human love
[1:10:00] this is agape love
[1:10:03] right feel your love is what we would
[1:10:05] have for that of our wife
[1:10:08] right family but this agape love the
[1:10:11] Bible tells us God is love
[1:10:15] so when it talks about love right here
[1:10:17] this is it's talking about God
[1:10:20] in us love endures long
[1:10:24] and is patient and kind
[1:10:27] in other words love don't have a short
[1:10:29] fuse
[1:10:31] you don't like the firecrackers you get
[1:10:34] before you hardly throw them out of your
[1:10:35] hand boom they're gone no no
[1:10:38] love got a long fuse on it
[1:10:45] and I don't want to necessarily love God
[1:10:47] of fuse but you understand what I'm
[1:10:48] saying love constraineth less it
[1:10:52] controls us it urges us it impels us
[1:10:57] Hallelujah
[1:10:59] it keeps you from blowing potatoes over
[1:11:01] everybody like a pressure cooker love
[1:11:04] endures long
[1:11:06] and this patient and kind
[1:11:10] now that's that's some that's that's
[1:11:11] marvelous because you can suffer long
[1:11:17] right
[1:11:18] you can be like a dog that's ready to
[1:11:20] bite the next thing it comes along that
[1:11:22] ain't suffering long
[1:11:24] no no no no no that's saying don't get
[1:11:27] in my way because I might bite you even
[1:11:29] though I'm mad at so and so but the next
[1:11:31] person that crosses my pathway it's like
[1:11:34] they say in the woods when you're
[1:11:35] hunting deer if it's brown it's down
[1:11:39] laughs
[1:11:41] come on friends I know this is where the
[1:11:43] rubber meets a rope but it's true
[1:11:45] love endures long and is patient and
[1:11:48] kind
[1:11:49] love never is envious nor boils over
[1:11:53] with jealousy ooh that green-eyed
[1:11:57] monster of jealousy
[1:12:02] over the same I don't never get jealous
[1:12:04] you're lying
[1:12:05] you do sometimes you can get jealous
[1:12:07] even among family
[1:12:11] you can get jealous among church now
[1:12:12] what I'm trying to say is is that listen
[1:12:15] when God really doesn't work in your
[1:12:18] soul he don't change your flesh or
[1:12:20] parent
[1:12:22] but the God has come to direct us into
[1:12:26] the love of God
[1:12:28] right now there's a there's a key to all
[1:12:31] this here of living within that of
[1:12:33] Victory so notice it's not boastful or
[1:12:36] vainglorious
[1:12:38] you know it's it's not all about me
[1:12:42] right now I know you see these are
[1:12:45] things that's even character molding
[1:12:46] because sometimes what is called
[1:12:48] Fellowship ain't Fellowship
[1:12:51] is talk about me and you listenship
[1:12:56] right talk about my kids who cares about
[1:12:59] yours
[1:13:02] oh boy we're right down on the road now
[1:13:06] see that ain't that ain't that ain't
[1:13:08] what the love of God the love of God
[1:13:09] it's not about me
[1:13:11] look not every man on his own things
[1:13:17] you know life think about it
[1:13:19] our first birth and all of life is set
[1:13:22] up in that way our first birth is
[1:13:25] because of selfishness and pride is that
[1:13:28] right and we battle that you you battle
[1:13:31] that to the day that we are set free
[1:13:32] from here
[1:13:34] that thing of self we battle that and
[1:13:37] then to think even with the way that
[1:13:39] life itself and I'm talking about the
[1:13:41] way that things around us is so desired
[1:13:44] that even where a person that can see
[1:13:46] him and say well I don't want to be
[1:13:48] selfish but just sometimes with the
[1:13:50] cares of Life instead of us controlling
[1:13:54] the cares of life we allow them to
[1:13:56] control us you say I can't help it yes
[1:13:59] you can don't allow the devil to tell
[1:14:01] you that
[1:14:02] you can control it
[1:14:05] and not allow the situations to control
[1:14:08] you you're not living for this world
[1:14:10] you're living for God
[1:14:13] and victory comes by putting him first
[1:14:16] in everything
[1:14:18] my my mind
[1:14:20] it does not display itself heartily
[1:14:25] who
[1:14:26] my my
[1:14:28] you know like I'm somebody
[1:14:31] if you only had it like I had it
[1:14:33] if you only had the Revelation like we
[1:14:35] had it if that's the Revelation I don't
[1:14:38] want your revelation
[1:14:44] verse 5 it is not conceited
[1:14:49] which means to be arrogant and inflated
[1:14:52] with pride I'm sure we probably have
[1:14:54] never dealt with that or don't know
[1:14:56] anybody like that
[1:14:58] but this talk about us this is what love
[1:15:00] is not it is not rude
[1:15:03] unmannerly and does not act unbecomingly
[1:15:08] now I won't ask you to raise your hand
[1:15:10] but how many have had to repent don't
[1:15:11] don't raise your hands because
[1:15:14] but we've had to repent for our actions
[1:15:16] sometimes acting unbecomingly I'm gonna
[1:15:19] ask you who was that what was that that
[1:15:22] directed you and said Lord forgive me
[1:15:24] for the way I acted
[1:15:26] what was it it was the Lord directing
[1:15:29] your hearts into the love of God
[1:15:32] the love of God constrains us now notice
[1:15:34] love God's love in US does not insist on
[1:15:39] its own rights or its own way
[1:15:43] this right here the only thing I can
[1:15:44] think of is is like a picture of a
[1:15:46] temper tantrum in the floor
[1:15:48] except you know what that temper tantrum
[1:15:50] in the floor when it's young it changes
[1:15:53] when it gets older it just cuts
[1:15:55] everybody off
[1:15:59] you know why that's not been dealt with
[1:16:03] sometimes people's past let me let me
[1:16:05] say this to you now friends sometimes a
[1:16:07] past that's why it's very important for
[1:16:09] the Holy Spirit us to allow the Holy
[1:16:11] Spirit I'm talking about even his
[1:16:12] parents to allow him to comb through our
[1:16:15] lives in every way because we don't want
[1:16:18] to pass on hurts
[1:16:22] because the way that we've responded is
[1:16:24] from previous hurts we want to say Lord
[1:16:26] give me the grace that it stops right
[1:16:29] here
[1:16:30] that might have been how my family
[1:16:32] reacted but the character of Jesus
[1:16:35] Christ has displayed right now and I
[1:16:37] want to sacrifice my own will because I
[1:16:40] see the result of that
[1:16:45] oh my it's not about its own way
[1:16:49] you either do things my way or I'm
[1:16:51] quitting
[1:16:53] you do what I want or I I tell you what
[1:16:55] I ain't coming to church that is not the
[1:16:58] love of God
[1:17:00] and I'll tell you what you found one on
[1:17:01] boys standing right here I ain't bending
[1:17:03] to none of that
[1:17:07] that ain't just Samuel Browning but I am
[1:17:09] not because look this is important that
[1:17:12] love does not insist on its own rights
[1:17:15] its own way
[1:17:17] it's got to be the way of the word
[1:17:19] because the word has a true outcome
[1:17:24] is that right for it is not self-seeking
[1:17:29] oh
[1:17:30] it's not touchy
[1:17:32] we know what that means don't we
[1:17:35] or fretful
[1:17:37] or resentful
[1:17:39] or what's resentful
[1:17:42] what would be fretful or touchy
[1:17:45] resentful I mean you become resentful
[1:17:48] towards somebody
[1:17:50] that's not the love of God oh I've got
[1:17:52] the love of God that's a love no the
[1:17:54] love of God does not produce resent
[1:17:57] are you hearing me let me tell you how
[1:17:59] powerful resent is brother Brown would
[1:18:01] say it just like this he said when there
[1:18:02] is one in the congregation that is
[1:18:05] resenting the holy spirit will not
[1:18:07] reveal himself
[1:18:12] now you know you can just take it from
[1:18:14] me I know how that feels when maybe not
[1:18:16] just standing in front of a congregation
[1:18:18] but I know how it feels and sometimes I
[1:18:20] question myself sitting sometimes in
[1:18:22] counseling and I felt all alone
[1:18:26] they're one one scripture one quote
[1:18:28] coming to me
[1:18:30] and I felt all alone I really didn't
[1:18:32] know what it was at first that you know
[1:18:33] you think man why didn't you know you
[1:18:35] you later on this come this coming this
[1:18:37] but what it is it is even God's
[1:18:39] protection in that moment because if
[1:18:41] there's a resenting Spirit brother REM
[1:18:43] says he won't reveal himself
[1:18:46] and it's gone it's actually God's grace
[1:18:48] and mercy even on a person or persons
[1:18:51] that's God's mercy friends and I thank
[1:18:53] God for it right I'd rather it be
[1:18:56] withheld instead of something just come
[1:18:57] and be sad and it takes it the wrong way
[1:18:59] now notice it takes no account of the
[1:19:02] evil done to it
[1:19:05] it pays no attention to a suffered wrong
[1:19:07] what's that mean it means get it right
[1:19:09] rid of your file cabinet of everybody's
[1:19:10] wrongs
[1:19:12] yeah
[1:19:13] come on now like we said you know some
[1:19:16] some weeks ago you know and it was
[1:19:19] actually brother John Andy's at some
[1:19:20] point in time that I had heard him
[1:19:22] saying you know we've got to quit
[1:19:23] singing the song of somebody done
[1:19:24] somebody wrong song you know and going
[1:19:26] through it and John was just preaching I
[1:19:28] don't know if he said at a men's meeting
[1:19:29] or what but you know it's a thing to
[1:19:31] where you can become you can listen
[1:19:33] friends you can become so built up with
[1:19:35] offenses the Bible said offenses will
[1:19:38] come
[1:19:40] are you hearing me that's that's a
[1:19:42] scripture offenses are going to come but
[1:19:44] it depends on what we get built up with
[1:19:47] if you allow offenses to build up in
[1:19:49] your family if you allow fences to build
[1:19:51] up in your marriage if you allow it in
[1:19:54] the church remember it ain't the devil
[1:19:56] it ain't your brother it ain't your wife
[1:19:58] it ain't your husband nobody is there
[1:20:01] keeping records unless you choose to
[1:20:03] keep them
[1:20:05] hello all you always all I remember oh
[1:20:09] you always I've
[1:20:11] my Lord I thought I was going to get
[1:20:13] through this
[1:20:17] this is another thing love it does not
[1:20:19] rejoice at Injustice
[1:20:23] and unrighteousness but rejoices when
[1:20:26] right and Truth Prevail in other words
[1:20:28] if something's wrong
[1:20:30] I want to see
[1:20:32] the righteousness of God prevail
[1:20:35] if somebody's wrong I don't want to see
[1:20:37] well this needs to happen and that's
[1:20:39] wrong
[1:20:40] if something's wrong you want to see
[1:20:43] Lord that righteousness would Prevail
[1:20:46] truth would prevail
[1:20:49] that the lives would be helped and
[1:20:51] ministered to now notice love verse 7.
[1:20:56] Bears up under anything
[1:20:59] and everything that comes
[1:21:01] help me Lord
[1:21:04] is ever
[1:21:06] ready
[1:21:07] to believe the best of every person
[1:21:13] hello
[1:21:16] ever ready to believe the best of every
[1:21:19] person
[1:21:20] in other words
[1:21:23] I I want to believe
[1:21:27] and this is really where I stand I want
[1:21:29] to believe that you know what they
[1:21:31] didn't mean that
[1:21:33] didn't mean that
[1:21:36] no brother Sammy you don't know them you
[1:21:39] don't see even right there look at the
[1:21:41] spirit and look at the attitude
[1:21:43] are you hearing me friends I'm preaching
[1:21:46] right now
[1:21:48] I want to believe the best for every
[1:21:50] person
[1:21:53] this listen this is not quotes from a
[1:21:55] smiley face texting preaching in Texas
[1:21:58] that tells you you can name and claim a
[1:22:00] BMW after church this is the Gospel of
[1:22:03] Jesus Christ
[1:22:09] its hopes are faithless under all
[1:22:11] circumstances and it endures everything
[1:22:14] without weakening what does that love
[1:22:17] not our flesh and our spirit I'm not
[1:22:20] making excuse but I'm telling you our
[1:22:23] reasoning and in that realm it can never
[1:22:25] hold up it takes Divine love
[1:22:29] now let me just let me speak I know I've
[1:22:31] got just a few moments here left
[1:22:34] First Corinthians 13 8 charity this is
[1:22:36] where I'm drawing my my title from
[1:22:38] charity never faileth but where there be
[1:22:42] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[1:22:46] be tongues they'll cease whether there
[1:22:48] be knowledge it'll vanish away
[1:22:52] but charity will never fail
[1:22:54] now brother Branham is talking about and
[1:22:56] I want to just deal with
[1:22:58] this on
[1:22:59] of that of divine love we've read
[1:23:01] through much of the descriptive within
[1:23:04] that all of those things listen let me
[1:23:05] tell you this what we just read through
[1:23:07] here out of First Corinthians 13
[1:23:11] the bulk and majority of that right
[1:23:13] there is under adversity
[1:23:17] are you hearing me I mean it would say
[1:23:19] Lord I want to manifest all the word of
[1:23:21] God that's part of the word of God
[1:23:24] you realize even when we look at the
[1:23:27] virtues in the stature of a perfect man
[1:23:28] these are not just things that oh you've
[1:23:30] got this now oh you've got this now oh
[1:23:33] you've got this now that's not at all
[1:23:35] what is being said
[1:23:39] the adding is not actually the word
[1:23:41] adding it's mean making more room for
[1:23:45] and the only way those things come out
[1:23:47] and it grows in our life is through
[1:23:50] adversity
[1:23:52] fruit is not produced on the Mountaintop
[1:23:56] fruit is produced in the valley
[1:23:59] Hallelujah so it's not just things being
[1:24:01] added to us in that manner but it is
[1:24:04] growth that takes place
[1:24:06] by the divine nature of God working in
[1:24:08] our lives so brother Brahm is speaking
[1:24:10] remember to and just these are some very
[1:24:12] common situations but he's speaking
[1:24:14] remember to the old blind gentleman that
[1:24:16] was there and came on the platform of
[1:24:18] Mexico and brother ramsini had no shoes
[1:24:20] didn't have a coat and he was blind and
[1:24:22] brother Bram talks about how that he
[1:24:23] took that man up to his bosom
[1:24:26] and Billy Graham said without even
[1:24:27] expecting a vision or anything like that
[1:24:29] God uh brother Brahm just begin to crowd
[1:24:32] and said God be merciful to this man
[1:24:35] be merciful to him begin his the heart
[1:24:38] began to be expressed for that man
[1:24:41] brother Ram didn't know that God was
[1:24:42] going to do anything for him he didn't
[1:24:44] know that the Man's eyes would be open
[1:24:45] but he saw the need
[1:24:47] what was his need he was blind
[1:24:50] he also had physical needs his shoes
[1:24:54] you know his coat jacket
[1:24:57] and and here's what happened God came
[1:25:00] down and healed that Man's eyes
[1:25:04] and here's this is what brother Ram says
[1:25:07] what was it
[1:25:08] Divine love projected
[1:25:11] and it resulted in Sovereign Grace
[1:25:14] taking its place
[1:25:16] this is I want you to listen to this
[1:25:17] statement Divine love can only go so far
[1:25:24] but when it is held true to the end
[1:25:29] Sovereign Grace takes its place and
[1:25:31] produces that which love could not carry
[1:25:34] out now think of that when it's held
[1:25:36] true to its end
[1:25:39] and he just said Divine love can only go
[1:25:41] so far it doesn't mean that love has a
[1:25:44] limit
[1:25:45] because Divine love that is God
[1:25:49] are you hearing me but when he's saying
[1:25:51] it has its limit in that through the
[1:25:54] whole longevity or the period or that
[1:25:57] time of the situation or the need it
[1:26:00] must remain constant
[1:26:02] held true to the end
[1:26:06] in other words let me just say it like
[1:26:09] this don't abort mission
[1:26:13] because it isn't happening quick enough
[1:26:17] love is patient
[1:26:21] right so if it's not well things aren't
[1:26:24] changing I was just pray for right here
[1:26:25] tonight and bless God I didn't see no
[1:26:28] different when I got home
[1:26:30] who told you it's going to be different
[1:26:31] when you got home
[1:26:33] did God tell you that
[1:26:36] come on Friends preach with me now
[1:26:39] you see what is that
[1:26:41] it's when Divine love is projected and
[1:26:45] it holds true it holds true throughout
[1:26:48] the longevity then Sovereign Grace steps
[1:26:52] in that's what allows Grace to step in
[1:26:55] I'll tell you
[1:26:57] we need Grace to step in there are
[1:26:59] situations after situations in our lives
[1:27:03] in the church your job that friends we
[1:27:07] can try to we our fingers bleed to try
[1:27:10] to turn something around God there's
[1:27:13] only one thing that's going to do it
[1:27:14] it'll take Grace to step in and Grace
[1:27:17] will never step in without Divine love
[1:27:25] So Divine love makes the way for Grace
[1:27:29] what is it it's god making a way for
[1:27:32] himself
[1:27:33] for what's needed for the healing to
[1:27:35] resolve division marriage family matters
[1:27:38] so forth it's got to be the right order
[1:27:41] when Divine love is projected think of
[1:27:44] it John 3 16 familiar scripture for God
[1:27:48] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:27:51] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:27:53] him should not perish but have
[1:27:55] everlasting life notice God so loved the
[1:27:58] world now brother Adam said when Divine
[1:28:00] love is projected to its object
[1:28:05] God so loved the world the love was
[1:28:08] projected that way Sovereign Grace
[1:28:11] stepped in and produced what is
[1:28:14] projected
[1:28:18] I know this is really simple I pray that
[1:28:20] God
[1:28:22] allows it just to go down soul in our
[1:28:24] hearts and our lives
[1:28:26] because this is real victory
[1:28:32] this is real victory in our life
[1:28:35] when Divine love is projected to its
[1:28:39] object and let me just say this you
[1:28:41] can't project Divine love without Divine
[1:28:44] love
[1:28:48] right it has to be divine love those
[1:28:51] scriptures that I just read at First
[1:28:52] Corinthians 13. it's us giving ourselves
[1:28:57] to the will of God now I'm going to say
[1:28:59] this to you I I got more things that I
[1:29:01] could read of other quotes but I'm not
[1:29:03] around that's not where I'm going
[1:29:04] tonight
[1:29:05] but there's going to be times and there
[1:29:07] is times so let's put this in
[1:29:10] perspective that when you're looking at
[1:29:12] First Corinthians 13 you're going to
[1:29:15] have to pray and pray many times for
[1:29:19] situations God help me to have the right
[1:29:21] attitude
[1:29:23] help me to be patient I'm gonna tell you
[1:29:26] this right I just read is not autopilot
[1:29:31] it is US dying to ourselves and
[1:29:33] recognizing wait a minute here I need
[1:29:36] God to step in on the scene
[1:29:38] and it's going
[1:29:40] to be God stepping in
[1:29:43] by Divine love
[1:29:45] being projected
[1:29:47] now there's a few quotes here there's a
[1:29:50] brother and you've heard me refer to
[1:29:51] this numerous times there's a brother by
[1:29:53] the name of brother Krause now brother
[1:29:55] Krause
[1:29:56] was a good friend
[1:29:58] of brother Oral Roberts brother Branham
[1:30:00] all of them
[1:30:02] he came down with a bad
[1:30:05] kidney problem
[1:30:07] and his thought was because he loved me
[1:30:10] he supported all those Ministries and he
[1:30:12] loved them he said look he said I just
[1:30:14] you know what if I can just have a
[1:30:15] little time with brother Oral Roberts
[1:30:17] brother Oral Roberts prayed for him got
[1:30:19] a little bit better then it was right
[1:30:21] back
[1:30:22] then
[1:30:24] brother Branham he said well
[1:30:26] how do I need to go sit down with
[1:30:27] brother Brown she went and sat down with
[1:30:29] brother Brandon brother Brandon prayed
[1:30:31] brother Brown was praying for him
[1:30:33] and
[1:30:35] nothing lifted
[1:30:37] it was still there
[1:30:39] now it's a serious case and I if I can
[1:30:42] just paraphrase many of these points
[1:30:43] because it's in many messages but I like
[1:30:45] how brother the brand puts it together
[1:30:46] that this case that he was under was
[1:30:49] such a case that it was only a one in
[1:30:52] ten thousand chance survival
[1:30:54] if he went under the surgery
[1:30:59] and he believed that God you know they
[1:31:01] shall lay hands on the sick he believed
[1:31:03] that
[1:31:04] but as he was going in in every
[1:31:07] situation
[1:31:08] what it was
[1:31:10] is he had his
[1:31:12] love directed in the wrong place
[1:31:17] he had his love no it was the love of
[1:31:19] God but he had it directed toward
[1:31:22] brother Branham had it directed toward
[1:31:24] brother Roberts
[1:31:26] but when he got on that operating table
[1:31:29] his last words he said Lord
[1:31:33] I love you
[1:31:35] I love you and the testimony was
[1:31:39] is the doctors even in that moment were
[1:31:42] not even going to go ahead and perform
[1:31:43] the surgery but there was the glory of
[1:31:47] God came down in the operating room and
[1:31:50] it flooded that room to next thing he
[1:31:52] knew he wakes up and the doctors are
[1:31:55] even astounded at how the surgery went
[1:31:58] and then his recovery after that was way
[1:32:01] Beyond schedule
[1:32:05] brother Brown lets us know he said what
[1:32:08] it was he said
[1:32:09] his love had to be directed in the right
[1:32:13] way
[1:32:15] so it comes down to it that it's very
[1:32:19] key
[1:32:20] as brother Abraham says it regarding
[1:32:22] this that Divine love is projected in
[1:32:25] the right direction in other words it's
[1:32:27] going to have the right motives this is
[1:32:29] what he says in another place the
[1:32:31] alternatives are right behind it because
[1:32:34] if the motives aren't right then it's
[1:32:36] not the love of God
[1:32:39] but the Alternatives that's why brother
[1:32:41] Brandon says if you say I want God to
[1:32:43] heal me he said well why
[1:32:46] why do you want God to heal you
[1:32:49] there's none of her I've heard but now I
[1:32:50] see why do you want God to hear me so
[1:32:52] you can go on and live the same way or
[1:32:53] you've been living
[1:32:55] and he said if you want God to hear
[1:32:56] there's got to be a reason because Faith
[1:32:59] must find a true place to rest
[1:33:03] I don't want to be healed because I want
[1:33:05] to serve him better
[1:33:07] I want to serve him better
[1:33:09] I don't care if it's just a headache
[1:33:11] Lord Touch Me Lord so that my mind is
[1:33:13] free for today
[1:33:16] I believe that's I believe I believe I
[1:33:18] don't just believe I know there's the
[1:33:19] kind of God that we serve
[1:33:22] now think about it let me just say just
[1:33:25] say this here the love of God notice in
[1:33:28] the right direction so it's it's
[1:33:30] projected to the object and in the right
[1:33:32] direction it's where love is being
[1:33:34] projected to God it's where our love
[1:33:37] it's drawing us closer so in a test or a
[1:33:40] trout I'm talking about being a useful
[1:33:42] life it should be drawing us closer to
[1:33:45] God
[1:33:47] the love of God doesn't lead us further
[1:33:50] from him
[1:33:52] well brother Samuel I love him more than
[1:33:54] ever and go away from the word you can't
[1:33:58] that doesn't make sense
[1:34:00] right because it's the love of God that
[1:34:04] shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[1:34:05] ghost that holds Us in those times it's
[1:34:08] a yearning it's a Desiring for more of
[1:34:10] him notice the scripture said he that
[1:34:13] hath my Commandments and keepeth them he
[1:34:16] it is that loveth me and he that loveth
[1:34:18] me shall be loved of my father and I
[1:34:21] will love him and will manifest myself
[1:34:23] to him
[1:34:25] think about Ruth
[1:34:27] I have these scriptures but I don't have
[1:34:29] time to read them but probably perhaps
[1:34:32] no doubt many are familiar with that
[1:34:34] whole account Ruth forsook the land of
[1:34:37] her Nativity
[1:34:39] to go with her mother-in-law
[1:34:41] she loved Naomi and she said
[1:34:46] your God is going to be my God
[1:34:48] your people is going to be my people
[1:34:51] where you stay that's where I'm going to
[1:34:53] stay she made that decision then they
[1:34:55] get into the land
[1:34:57] and here she is in a field
[1:35:00] and she makes a request
[1:35:02] there among the Reapers and the chief
[1:35:06] Reaper who's in the field when the
[1:35:08] mighty Angel when Bo has descends the
[1:35:11] chief Reaper is able to tell Boaz
[1:35:14] this is who this is
[1:35:16] this is Ruth
[1:35:18] and this is what she's asked she's asked
[1:35:20] that she might be able to glean behind
[1:35:23] the handmaids not walk along next to him
[1:35:26] but
[1:35:26] if I can just walk behind them and pick
[1:35:30] up what's behind them
[1:35:32] will you let me do that
[1:35:34] and notice her humility it drew boy
[1:35:37] to where the very next verse is Boaz
[1:35:39] tells her abide in this field
[1:35:42] stay right here
[1:35:44] and I don't want you walking behind the
[1:35:46] maidens I want you to walk right with
[1:35:48] the maidens I want you to pick up
[1:35:50] what is there I want you to take and
[1:35:52] what did he say my daughter don't go to
[1:35:55] another field
[1:35:57] stay right here
[1:35:58] in this field
[1:36:00] see it's it's that place of staying
[1:36:03] right in God's presence charity never
[1:36:08] faileth
[1:36:09] Ruth never even had in her mind that she
[1:36:12] would end up in the position that she
[1:36:15] ended up in
[1:36:18] but charity never fails
[1:36:22] her conditions no it wasn't pleasurable
[1:36:24] conditions she didn't have everything
[1:36:26] delivered to her but charity never
[1:36:29] failed she continued in projecting the
[1:36:32] love of God and it held
[1:36:34] in that moment
[1:36:36] I just say it like this let me just read
[1:36:38] this
[1:36:40] in closing
[1:36:42] and I'll stop right here tonight
[1:36:44] when brother Brown talks about that bull
[1:36:46] and I want you to think about the word
[1:36:48] consecration for a moment
[1:36:56] but Brands talked about how he's seen
[1:36:58] that ball one
[1:36:59] he said here he come when he walked in
[1:37:01] the pastor you heard brother Berry
[1:37:02] describe it here on Sunday of what took
[1:37:05] place after brother Brown stepped across
[1:37:07] the fence and he broke down and just
[1:37:09] trembled and just crying
[1:37:11] because after the situation brother
[1:37:14] Brands described me and said here he
[1:37:15] come something happened
[1:37:17] I wish that would happen all the time
[1:37:21] it just don't do it
[1:37:24] but when I see a true real tremendous
[1:37:26] sick case
[1:37:28] and something happens
[1:37:30] it's not man
[1:37:33] it's when God can get a hold of man
[1:37:38] it's when it's consecrated
[1:37:40] I think that'd just be a good place to
[1:37:42] end tonight
[1:37:45] to be a useful life is to be a life that
[1:37:47] God can get a hold of
[1:37:49] at any moment
[1:37:51] brother Brown never planned on walking
[1:37:53] in front of a bull especially that bull
[1:37:55] he had heard about that bull that bull
[1:37:57] had just killed a man and they had sold
[1:38:00] it and he had forgot they put in that
[1:38:02] pasture and I'll tell you what remember
[1:38:04] what he told us he reached for his gun
[1:38:07] but he had left his gun in his truck
[1:38:09] seat and brother Brown said it very
[1:38:11] clear
[1:38:12] if he'd had the gun
[1:38:15] it had been a dead bull
[1:38:18] you with me
[1:38:20] so this isn't us walking around and you
[1:38:23] know walking around like well here's a
[1:38:25] mountain lion I'm gonna do this no
[1:38:26] brother brem didn't do that
[1:38:29] well I'm gonna let the love of God come
[1:38:31] down and I'm gonna no I'll tell you what
[1:38:32] I'm gonna do is reach for the gun if
[1:38:34] I've got one or run for a tree
[1:38:36] come on friends that was not brother
[1:38:38] Branham doing that
[1:38:40] and that's why I'm trying to end with
[1:38:42] tonight it wasn't brother Brown you know
[1:38:44] you hear it tell you know of other
[1:38:45] brothers they've been in other
[1:38:46] situations some have been in more
[1:38:48] extraneous situations and hunting and
[1:38:50] you know what they they were talking
[1:38:52] about this story and they said you know
[1:38:53] what I did and somewhere around in
[1:38:54] Africa I ran up the tree I didn't want
[1:38:57] to get you know have the horns come into
[1:38:59] me oh well brother Samuel where is the
[1:39:01] where is that of the love of God brother
[1:39:03] Branham even talked about the horns if
[1:39:05] he'd had the can of spray in his hand
[1:39:07] when they came out he just prayed him
[1:39:10] are you hearing me this isn't about man
[1:39:13] walking out let me show you love is not
[1:39:15] vainglorious
[1:39:17] brother Ram is letting us know he had no
[1:39:21] idea
[1:39:24] but what happened well brother Samuel
[1:39:25] what took place the love of God but
[1:39:27] here's the key
[1:39:29] because you and I are not going to know
[1:39:32] when situations and things arise
[1:39:34] but here's the key consecration
[1:39:39] like the song We sang before as I come
[1:39:41] out
[1:39:42] just to stay in his presence
[1:39:46] because listen in his prayer I'm not
[1:39:48] just talking about praying
[1:39:51] you and I both know I I you know
[1:39:55] thank you
[1:39:56] I don't want to go all the way into that
[1:39:57] but you know because people can pray and
[1:40:00] pray and be mean as a rattlesnake
[1:40:03] why is that they're not getting
[1:40:06] beyond the carpet that they're kneeling
[1:40:07] on
[1:40:10] did I talk about getting in his presence
[1:40:11] said listen that isn't just you know on
[1:40:14] our knees
[1:40:15] you can get in the prince of God
[1:40:17] sometimes it's just for us to just
[1:40:19] in prayer we're just meditating
[1:40:23] which sometimes are I just I just sit
[1:40:25] there as times where I've been in
[1:40:26] situations whether I've been out in a
[1:40:28] meeting sometimes it's been I just just
[1:40:31] going downstairs and one I just sat
[1:40:32] there and then
[1:40:33] his voice just starts flooding I'm not
[1:40:36] even saying a word
[1:40:38] it's just his presence is there we're
[1:40:40] just going that's prayer prayer isn't
[1:40:42] that I've got to be saying something
[1:40:44] prayer is where my heart is open for
[1:40:46] communion
[1:40:48] it's in his prayer you know what that is
[1:40:50] it's consecrating us it's tenderizing us
[1:40:52] it's making us available
[1:40:55] it's breaking down our will
[1:40:57] and prayer doesn't have to be a check-in
[1:40:59] and check out
[1:41:01] prayer without ceasing just just staying
[1:41:04] available to God just talking to him
[1:41:06] throughout the day
[1:41:07] I'm over my time here
[1:41:10] but I want to just say it's being
[1:41:12] consecrated
[1:41:13] it's not us it's not me it's not you
[1:41:15] flipping a switch and I hope that's a
[1:41:18] thing that I trust by the grace of God
[1:41:20] when we're looking at it love never
[1:41:22] fails it it is not it is not all love is
[1:41:27] patient bless God I've got to be patient
[1:41:29] and I'm going to know it's Lord I want
[1:41:32] to give myself to you
[1:41:34] and I I want to see more of you in me I
[1:41:39] don't even know what situations await me
[1:41:42] tonight I don't know what awaits me
[1:41:44] tomorrow morning I don't even know what
[1:41:45] awaits me next I don't know that
[1:41:49] but my heart's desire is this Lord mold
[1:41:51] me and make me
[1:41:53] I want his presence I want the dove not
[1:41:57] to fly away from me I want the dove to
[1:41:59] abide with me
[1:42:00] or abide with me abide in me I need him
[1:42:04] I need you every hour
[1:42:07] it may not be a bull we're walking in or
[1:42:09] Hornets or
[1:42:10] it may not be anything like that at all
[1:42:12] but I'll tell you just as much as that
[1:42:15] was unsuspecting in the prophet's life
[1:42:18] and unpredicted
[1:42:20] that's exactly how things come our way
[1:42:23] but I say Lord
[1:42:24] I'm not going to fret it what could
[1:42:26] possibly lay before me because he
[1:42:28] doesn't want us to do that
[1:42:30] but Lord let my life be so overtaken
[1:42:34] with the love of God
[1:42:36] I would just want to abide in his
[1:42:38] presence I listen to his word and put
[1:42:40] the message I just want to enjoy him
[1:42:42] just let my life be so saturated with
[1:42:45] him
[1:42:47] is that your desire because that love
[1:42:49] it'll never fail it'll never fail when
[1:42:53] it makes a way for Sovereign Grace to
[1:42:56] step in
[1:42:57] it did for our lives let's pray
[1:43:00] father
[1:43:04] Lord
[1:43:07] I just lowered it
[1:43:09] just want to say Lord how I love you
[1:43:12] we love you father
[1:43:15] oh God we are we're not making excuses
[1:43:18] but Lord we're not perfect people
[1:43:21] but Lord our Perfection is in you
[1:43:25] and it's our desire Lord oh Lord Jesus
[1:43:29] I want to be more like you Lord
[1:43:33] father when I read this there's not a
[1:43:35] time that I don't read that Lord in
[1:43:37] First Corinthians 13 over all the
[1:43:39] countless years there's not a time that
[1:43:42] I don't read it that Lord my heart and
[1:43:45] even in prayer and stopping and saying
[1:43:47] Lord grant it Lord in my life Lord
[1:43:51] I want more of you Lord we want more of
[1:43:54] you Lord
[1:43:55] Lord we certainly don't know the
[1:43:58] circumstances and things that Lord that
[1:44:01] could arise and I don't believe the love
[1:44:02] of God is just even about circumstances
[1:44:05] though
[1:44:06] those circumstances Lord
[1:44:09] require the love of God but Lord I
[1:44:13] believe that God that our lives it was
[1:44:16] intended Lord that we would walk every
[1:44:20] day
[1:44:21] by the love of God in the love of God
[1:44:24] help us Lord I pray God as a people
[1:44:27] May Lord is your presence Lord just God
[1:44:30] just sweeping down Lord among us Lord
[1:44:33] May Our Lives Lord as we give ourselves
[1:44:37] to you Lord I just
[1:44:39] and say Lord
[1:44:40] may you touch Lord every one of our
[1:44:44] hearts Lord if there's a heart that does
[1:44:47] not know that of the deepness of the
[1:44:51] love and of God lord of the sweetness
[1:44:54] Lord of your presence Lord of that love
[1:44:57] that God gives Lord a real peace and a
[1:45:01] satisfaction Lord that brings a real
[1:45:04] desire Lord and a real hunger in a
[1:45:06] reality of God in their life Lord grant
[1:45:09] it right here Lord even this evening
[1:45:11] Lord may it just Lord be a heart that is
[1:45:14] just set in motion Lord to seek after
[1:45:17] that reality Lord until Lord God that of
[1:45:21] the love of God Is So pulsates in their
[1:45:24] heart and their life and Lord It's the
[1:45:27] love of God that constrains us Lord it
[1:45:31] compels us it urges us it impels us lord
[1:45:34] it's you that's moving behind us and in
[1:45:38] US Lord and through us we just Lord want
[1:45:41] to continue to surrender ourselves to
[1:45:44] you
[1:45:45] we want to be available Lord
[1:45:47] we want to be available
[1:45:49] that God like the prophet said that
[1:45:51] where you can get a hold of a man
[1:45:54] Lord may we live in that way Lord
[1:45:58] I don't want the wrong feeling to take a
[1:46:00] hold of me I don't want the wrong
[1:46:02] attitude I don't want to be Lord where
[1:46:05] our lives are being fed on the wrong
[1:46:07] things and Lord we quickly go to the
[1:46:09] flesh no
[1:46:11] Lord we want to feed
[1:46:14] on the things of God we want to give
[1:46:17] ourselves Lord to the word that brings
[1:46:20] strength that brings the real nutrients
[1:46:22] in our life Lord
[1:46:24] granted Lord I pray we want to give
[1:46:27] ourselves to you
[1:46:28] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:37] I think of that scripture we didn't get
[1:46:39] to it tonight but very familiar in the
[1:46:42] book of Jude
[1:46:44] keeping yourselves
[1:46:48] in the love of God
[1:46:51] I think that's I think that's true I
[1:46:54] believe it's true
[1:46:56] I want to keep myself there
[1:46:59] I want to keep myself there in the love
[1:47:00] of God I want to be
[1:47:02] just keeping myself before his presence
[1:47:05] because as I'm there before his presence
[1:47:09] I'm captured by his presence but it's
[1:47:11] it's his character it's his nature that
[1:47:14] not only is being revealed to me
[1:47:17] but it'll guide my actions
[1:47:19] it'll shape me it'll mold me
[1:47:23] see it's things that even what we're not
[1:47:25] even thinking about even consciously
[1:47:27] aware of but keeping ourselves in the
[1:47:29] love of God it's transforming us
[1:47:32] it's changing us from Glory
[1:47:35] unto Glory
[1:47:39] don't you love him tonight
[1:47:42] and let's stand if you'd like to and go
[1:47:44] ahead and lead us

[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:53] I think that particular verse I think
[1:57:56] that's powerful
[1:57:57] because you know sometimes there's
[1:57:59] situations that we'd like to run from
[1:58:02] but it matters where you're running to
[1:58:06] you know sometimes there's things where
[1:58:08] you
[1:58:10] maybe on your job or whatever more
[1:58:12] sometimes you have to kind of
[1:58:15] do what you can to say you know I
[1:58:18] I need to have just a moment from this
[1:58:21] but it's who you make your Refuge that's
[1:58:24] what matters
[1:58:25] and we have a place
[1:58:27] like the Holy Spirit brought to us on
[1:58:29] Sunday night where we can let off the
[1:58:31] pressure
[1:58:32] 's are going to come
[1:58:34] all these things are going to come it
[1:58:37] comes
[1:58:38] I mean I don't know about you but I I
[1:58:41] read that and
[1:58:43] First Corinthians 13 and I realize
[1:58:46] those are not just things that manifest
[1:58:48] or come out
[1:58:50] of our lives without there being
[1:58:53] something
[1:58:55] that requires it to come out of our life
[1:58:58] remember all the Redemptive names of
[1:59:00] Jehovah
[1:59:01] that's who he is
[1:59:03] but it was situations needs that caused
[1:59:07] him to reveal himself in that way
[1:59:10] and see the way that God does is the
[1:59:12] same thing in in our moments brother
[1:59:14] Branham in each one of these situations
[1:59:16] that I referred to and I didn't get all
[1:59:18] the way through but he refers to every
[1:59:20] one of them and calls to calls them a
[1:59:23] crisis
[1:59:26] a crisis the bull the Hornets the maniac
[1:59:30] a crisis
[1:59:33] but when Divine Love Came
[1:59:36] Grace stepped in
[1:59:41] oh God that's
[1:59:42] that's what I want that's what I need I
[1:59:44] need more I need more
[1:59:47] but REM said it like this in one place
[1:59:49] he said Grace
[1:59:50] stepped in
[1:59:52] when I needed it
[1:59:54] when I needed it
[1:59:58] oh my
[2:00:00] I want to just so set myself to where my
[2:00:03] expectations
[2:00:05] is for Grace to step in
[2:00:10] that's what love
[2:00:12] that's what love will do
[2:00:14] aren't you grateful for the grace of God
[2:00:16] tonight
[2:00:17] aren't you glad he's still working on us
[2:00:20] I'm glad about that
[2:00:22] God his presence did not sweep down here
[2:00:24] tonight
[2:00:25] to condemn us he come to Lift Us higher
[2:00:29] I want to go higher Lord
[2:00:31] I want to go high remember the Lord
[2:00:33] shall direct your hearts into the love
[2:00:36] of God and the patient waiting of our
[2:00:40] Lord Jesus Christ remove all hindrances
[2:00:43] I'm glad
[2:00:45] I'm glad
[2:00:49] hallelujah amen God bless you tonight as
[2:00:51] you go
