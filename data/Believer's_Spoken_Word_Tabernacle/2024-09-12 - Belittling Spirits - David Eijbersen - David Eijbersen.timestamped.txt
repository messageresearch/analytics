[31:43] gathered together amen it's good to have
[31:46] uh Brother David Iverson here with us
[31:48] all the way from Belgium and uh comes
[31:52] from Nazareth Belgium and so those of us
[31:55] that were at the men's meeting we
[31:56] already had a little foraste and then I
[31:59] had a foraste before that men's meeting
[32:02] and uh I was so thankful that Brother
[32:05] David was able to uh see it in his
[32:07] schedule to come by here I I know you're
[32:09] going to be blessed and uh we just so
[32:12] appreciate all the all the variety of
[32:14] God's gifts because every gift that God
[32:17] has given he knows what you and I would
[32:20] have need of and it's always him but
[32:22] it's him coming through a multifaceted
[32:25] channel to minister to our lives and and
[32:28] I just so love and appreciate all the
[32:31] different approaches because when it's
[32:34] all said and done we walk away with
[32:36] seeing the Lord
[32:38] Jesus and our lives being challenged and
[32:41] being encouraged in the things of God
[32:44] and I believe tonight that even though
[32:46] that this wasn't Al together maybe
[32:49] planned out until about a month ago when
[32:51] everything brother Paul and I we had
[32:53] kind of got it together um but I believe
[32:56] it was in God's mind before the found
[32:57] foundation of the world I believe that
[33:00] cuz nothing is by chance or by accident
[33:03] with God so we just we just want to just
[33:06] come to that place and say Lord what you
[33:09] have for this moment I want to be ready
[33:13] for this moment I I don't know what
[33:15] tomorrow holds but you do and he holds
[33:18] tomorrow I want my life to be in his
[33:20] hands right now because God knows right
[33:23] now what he'll deliver is what I'll need
[33:26] for tomorrow God's always on time isn't
[33:29] he amen so I'm just going to invite
[33:34] Brother David and then you know I'm not
[33:36] going to let brother Paul Escape without
[33:39] singing so I think we'll do it like this
[33:42] it's such a wonderful atmosphere and
[33:43] brother Paul would only add to that but
[33:46] brother Paul after the service you see
[33:49] how the service goes and I want you just
[33:50] to sing in the after service how the
[33:53] Lord would lead you so aren't you
[33:55] thankful for brother Paul love brother
[33:58] Paul so
[34:00] much Brother Paul's been such a such a
[34:03] blessing and an inspiration to my life
[34:05] and and uh and so we just are so
[34:07] thankful amen for brother Paul for you
[34:09] to be here tonight and bring Brother
[34:11] David amen amen we're ready for the word
[34:13] of the Lord amen amen could we sing this
[34:16] one more time I am here Lord to present
[34:21] myself to
[34:23] [Music]

[34:31] that I can
[34:35] do will you wash me and dress me in
[34:43] [Music]
[34:58] [Music]

[35:48] the Lord Jesus Christ amen you you may
[35:51] be seated just for a minute before we
[35:53] read the word of God and uh I'm so
[35:56] thankful to be with with you here and uh
[35:59] as Brother Sam said I bring you
[36:01] greetings from Nazareth in Belgium so uh

[37:01] have you know when the Holy Spirit gets
[37:03] a hold of you and I so enjoyed Brother

[37:08] a pleasure and an honor to be part of
[37:10] the team and uh We've also had him in in
[37:14] Belgium and it was a real blessing to
[37:17] many people all of us and we're so glad

[37:41] and so uh may the Lord bless you all and
[37:44] uh we'll stand for the reading of the
[37:47] word and uh if you will forgive my
[37:51] Flemish accent but
[37:55] uh we'll we'll try to bring our Point AC

[38:01] Bible to the book of uh
[38:04] hagi hagi chapter
[38:14] 2 verse one
[38:29] we'll read a few verses and then we'll
[38:32] go into the word
[38:34] tonight in the seventh month in the 1
[38:37] and 20th day of the month came the word
[38:40] of the Lord by the prophet Hagi saying
[38:43] speak now to zerubabel the son of
[38:46] shaltiel governor of Judah and to Joshua
[38:49] the son of josec the high priest and to
[38:53] the residue of the people saying who is
[38:57] left among you that saw this house in
[39:00] her first
[39:02] glory and how do you see it now is it
[39:06] not in your eyes in
[39:08] comparison of it as
[39:11] nothing yet now be strong o zerubabel
[39:14] sayeth the Lord and be strong oh Joshua
[39:16] son of josec the high priest and be
[39:20] strong all ye people of the land sayeth
[39:22] the Lord and work for I Am with You
[39:25] sayeth the Lord of hosts according to
[39:29] the word that I covenanted with you when
[39:32] you came out of Egypt so my spirit
[39:36] remaineth among you amen fear ye not do
[39:41] you believe that tonight amen for thus
[39:44] sayeth the Lord of hosts yet once it is
[39:46] a little while and I will shake the
[39:49] heavens and the earth and the Sea and
[39:51] the dry land and I will shake the
[39:54] Nations and the desire of all Nations
[39:56] shall shall come and I will fill this
[40:00] house with Glory sayeth the Lord of
[40:03] hosts Hallelujah the silver is mine and
[40:07] the gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts
[40:10] the glory of this latter house shall be
[40:12] greater than of the former sayith the
[40:15] Lord of hosts and in this place will I
[40:18] give peace sayeth the Lord of
[40:21] hosts amen let's just take another
[40:25] scripture from the New Testament first 1
[40:27] John
[40:28] 4 verse 1 to 4 1 John
[40:35] 4 do you love the the Lord this evening
[40:39] you love the word of God amen
[40:42] amen beloved believe not every Spirit
[40:45] but try the spirits whether they are of
[40:49] God because many false prophets are gone
[40:53] out into the
[40:55] world hereby know the spirit of God
[40:59] every spirit that confesses that Jesus
[41:01] Christ is come in the flesh is of
[41:04] God and every spirit that confessed not
[41:07] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[41:09] is not of God and this is that Spirit of
[41:13] the Antichrist that Spirit of antichrist
[41:17] whereof ye have heard that it should
[41:19] come and even now already is in the
[41:22] world ye are of God little children and
[41:26] have over overcome them past T am past T
[41:31] am Hallelujah because greater is he that
[41:34] is in you than he that is in the world
[41:38] Amen let's just bow our heads before you
[41:40] sit down dear heavenly father I thank
[41:44] you Father it's I count it as a
[41:47] privilege to be standing here in the
[41:49] Pulpit of my precious friend Brother Sam
[41:52] Browning Lord and I pray that you will
[41:55] bless this service tonight tonight bless
[41:58] every hearer even the people that might
[42:00] be following on the Internet or later
[42:03] archive Lord we know your Holy Spirit
[42:06] Knows No Time father and your word is
[42:09] always fresh and new Lord I pray Lord
[42:12] that may I may be able to step aside and
[42:15] that the Holy Spirit May minister to
[42:17] what you want to tell to this church
[42:19] Lord father I don't know what is in the
[42:22] hearts of the people but you do father
[42:25] and I pray that you will direct my
[42:28] thoughts and Lord that you will anoint
[42:30] my lips to speak and father not just my
[42:33] lips but every heart here tonight Lord
[42:36] that we may become better Christians
[42:39] Lord we may live closer to you father we
[42:42] humbly pray if there's anything wrong in
[42:45] my life in our lives Lord that you will
[42:48] forgive us Lord and as we sang the songs
[42:50] Lord that we may be available to you
[42:53] Lord and cleanse us Lord in jesus' Name
[42:56] Lord and father that your Holy Spirit
[42:58] may have full Liberty tonight and that
[43:01] you may receive the honor and the glory
[43:03] in jesus' name we ask it amen and amen
[43:07] just greet your brother and sister
[43:08] before you sit down
[43:11] and God bless you tonight in the
[43:13] presence of the
[43:15] Lord well it's good to be in the church
[43:18] on on a Thursday night yes sir
[43:21] hallelujah how many are happy to be here
[43:25] amen David said I was glad when they
[43:27] said unto me let's go into the house of
[43:30] the Lord and even if you're not May the
[43:33] joy of the Lord be restored to us
[43:36] amen hallelujah well I would like to
[43:39] speak tonight uh on a subject that uh
[43:44] the Lord really put upon my heart
[43:46] strongly and uh as a title I would give
[43:49] it the title belittling Spirits
[43:52] belittling
[43:54] Spirits we've just read in the Bible
[43:56] that where John uh encourages us and he
[44:01] uh he uh instructs us not to believe any
[44:04] Spirit or every Spirit but that we have
[44:07] to try the spirits whether they are of
[44:11] God so I believe may the Lord help us
[44:14] tonight that we do that for a moment I
[44:17] believe this is not just Thursday night
[44:19] but every day of Our Lives amen and I
[44:23] believe God has given us the spirit of
[44:25] discernment
[44:27] and it it comes by knowing who Christ is
[44:30] and knowing what the word is knowing the
[44:33] message of the hour and knowing if
[44:36] anyone says anything different we can
[44:38] discern the spirits knowing if anyone
[44:41] has a different attitude we can discern
[44:44] the spirit that is behind it that's
[44:46] right Hallelujah so we see in our
[44:48] opening scripture in hay and um I'm
[44:53] trying to paraphrase and I don't want to
[44:55] keep you too long tonight
[44:57] but just speak from my heart if if you
[44:59] will allow but we see here that God is
[45:03] actually commissioning uh the Church of
[45:05] that day to rebuild the Temple and he is
[45:09] calling the high priest he's calling the
[45:12] governor and he's calling everybody and
[45:15] he's actually launching a challenge and
[45:18] he says who is left among you that saw
[45:21] this house in her first Glory we could
[45:25] say it maybe about this church who has
[45:27] seen the the humble beginnings of this
[45:29] church and all the Glorious moments
[45:32] we've had before all the revivals and
[45:34] the Holy Spirit coming down blessing the
[45:37] meetings so I think it's a question
[45:40] that's appropriate for every church and
[45:42] even for us here tonight who is left
[45:45] that saw the original
[45:48] church and and he says how do you see it
[45:52] now so the Lord is asking those
[45:54] questions who who are the old- that saw
[45:57] the
[45:58] beginning and and we see as as we look
[46:02] around on on a a global scale that uh in
[46:06] the message there is a transition coming
[46:09] that the Pioneers are just little by
[46:11] little dying out and leaving the scene
[46:14] and and if we're not careful we're
[46:17] looking back and the Lord asks us the
[46:18] question who was there when the Pioneers
[46:21] were here who was there when brother
[46:23] Bram was still here we see the last the
[46:26] last Witnesses leaving the scene and now
[46:29] he has the second question how do you
[46:32] see it now how do you look at the
[46:34] message tonight how do you look at your
[46:37] own pastor this
[46:40] church and he says is it not in your
[46:43] eyes the third question in in comparison
[46:46] as of of it as
[46:49] nothing in other words you're looking to
[46:51] all the Glorious times but you look to
[46:54] today and it looks small or Nothing in
[46:58] Your Eyes that's good that's good listen
[47:01] this is not the eyes of God this is he's
[47:03] clearly saying in your eyes that's good
[47:06] yes sir and he's saying right away and
[47:09] he's dealing with the
[47:11] discouragement uh he's dealing with
[47:13] those belittling spirits that said well
[47:16] God did the Miracles and the signs and
[47:18] God did the revivals and the Holy Spirit
[47:20] came down and we tend to speak about the
[47:23] past in in such a way with some kind of
[47:27] nostalgy as if God wasn't doing the same
[47:30] thing as if God has stopped somewhere
[47:33] along the road but he's still the same
[47:36] tonight Hallelujah so he's asking us
[47:39] tonight how do you look at this church
[47:42] how do you even look at the message how
[47:44] do you look at the prophet how do you
[47:46] look at the
[47:48] ministers is it as
[47:50] nothing but he's saying and and we see
[47:53] the Lord by asking those questions
[47:57] he's actually dealing with something
[47:59] that is in the minds of the people
[48:01] there's a spirit of
[48:05] discouragement you know what I grew up
[48:08] under leadership older brothers and my
[48:12] grandfather who founded the church and
[48:14] then later on another older brother I
[48:16] was a co-pastor I've been through many
[48:19] things and I've seen my own church where
[48:22] I grew up as a child I've seen people
[48:24] become so discouraged and and and
[48:27] sometimes look back and those were the
[48:31] days if we're not careful Brothers
[48:34] sister we we tend to look back to the
[48:37] past and God is always
[48:39] advancing you never you never saw the
[48:42] pillar of fire in the desert going in
[48:45] the opposite direction let let's let's
[48:47] go back to Egypt no it was those
[48:49] belittling spirits that said well the
[48:52] garlic putts of Egypt were better but
[48:55] let me tell you this is getting better
[48:57] and better all the time
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:02] Hallelujah the harder we have to fight
[49:04] the better the the sweeter the victory
[49:08] but the Lord is dealing with the
[49:09] discouragement those spirits in the
[49:12] hearts of the people of Israel and
[49:14] listen you can read the chapters it's
[49:16] just two or three chapters it's a and
[49:19] and they are looking at the plans that
[49:21] God has given listen the first that
[49:23] Temple of of Solomon that Mighty Temple
[49:27] with all the gold and and and you know
[49:30] the the
[49:31] carim in in the in the curtains and all
[49:34] the Splender and the
[49:36] glory you and the Thousand and the tens
[49:39] of thousands of animals that Solomon
[49:42] sacrificed and the priests couldn't even
[49:45] Minister because The Cloud of Glory was
[49:48] there and and and here is the temple
[49:51] destroyed because Israel had left the
[49:55] Lord and now the Lord is saying I'm
[49:58] going to rebuild the
[50:00] Temple and they look back to all the
[50:03] glory of Solon and they couldn't simply
[50:07] believe that God was going to do
[50:10] something greater than ever
[50:12] before and and now God is laying out the
[50:15] plans and and they see compared to the
[50:17] Temple of Solomon that the temple is
[50:20] much smaller in size that it it looks
[50:23] less
[50:24] glorious but the Lord is here I I always
[50:28] say the best weapon here is the people
[50:30] discouraged the best weapon against
[50:33] discouragement is to take
[50:36] courage so so after asking this question
[50:40] and here they're looking but this is
[50:42] maybe not not even a third of the Temple
[50:45] of Solomon we don't even have gold and
[50:47] the Lord is saying mine is the silver
[50:51] mine is the gold I will provide the
[50:55] finances how are we going to do this God
[50:57] will provide for this
[51:00] church not just spiritually but
[51:03] financially he will take care of his
[51:06] work
[51:07] hallelujah amen he's saying be strong
[51:11] verse four ohub sayeth the Lord and be
[51:15] strong oh Joshua son of josu the high
[51:18] priest and be strong all ye people of
[51:21] the land this is not just the ministry
[51:24] this is not just the leaders but it's
[51:26] for every one of us
[51:29] tonight
[51:30] Hallelujah all the people of the land
[51:33] from the youngest child in the church
[51:35] till the oldest brother and sister they
[51:37] might not even be attending church
[51:39] anymore but they're still part of the
[51:42] church and the Lord is saying be strong
[51:46] be strong little children be be strong
[51:48] young people be strong older ones
[51:52] Hallelujah for I Am With You sayith the
[51:54] Lord of host
[51:56] according to my Covenant when you came
[51:59] out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth
[52:03] among
[52:06] you
[52:09] Hallelujah I'm still here with my Holy
[52:12] Spirit I've always been here even when
[52:15] you didn't feel it or see it I've always
[52:17] been here hallelujah amen I've never
[52:21] left you even even when people left the
[52:23] church even when you got disappointed
[52:26] even in the hard times have always been
[52:28] with you Hallelujah the Holy Spirit has
[52:31] always been with you brother sister
[52:32] don't you fear Hallelujah and now God
[52:36] says I will shake the heavens I will
[52:38] shake the Earth the Sea and the dry land
[52:41] if this isn't a picture of
[52:44] today I will shake American politics I
[52:48] will shake Belgian politics European
[52:51] politics you know no country on earth is
[52:54] saved from this I will shake all the
[52:57] nations he says but I will fill this
[52:59] house
[53:01] hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to fill
[53:04] this house with
[53:06] glory amen we didn't deserve it but I'll
[53:10] tell you why it's very simple it's built
[53:13] upon the word of
[53:14] God hallelujah Heaven and Earth May will
[53:18] pass away but my word will never pass
[53:21] away this house is built on the word of
[53:24] God this house is built thus sayith the
[53:27] Lord and it cannot be
[53:30] shaken hallelujah
[53:33] hallelujah I will fill this house with
[53:36] glory Lord some people might say oh let
[53:39] the glory be back like in those days let
[53:41] me tell you he's saying the glory of
[53:43] this L house Hallelujah let me repeat it
[53:47] the glory of this L
[53:50] house this little structure that you're
[53:52] looking on and you you you think it's
[53:55] smaller in size you think it's less
[53:58] glorious this latter house this Glory
[54:01] shall be greater than the
[54:04] former Hallelujah so God is dealing
[54:06] directly with that those spirits of
[54:09] belittlement in the people's mind so
[54:12] good Hallelujah you can read it in the
[54:15] chapter he's saying you know you've
[54:17] built your nice houses you winded the
[54:19] forest you get out the wooden planks but
[54:22] my house is laying desolate
[54:27] Hallelujah God saying there's there's
[54:29] some material left to build this church
[54:33] Jesus said those words I will build my
[54:35] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[54:38] Prevail against them you're still here
[54:42] tonight every Gate of Hell is against
[54:44] you but you're the evidence tonight on a
[54:47] Thursday night that they cannot Prevail
[54:50] against
[54:52] you
[54:54] Hallelujah but some have to have come
[54:57] through deep trials some had to had to
[55:00] come and leave their family for this
[55:05] message that's right some have come
[55:07] through
[55:09] through the the deepest Trials of
[55:11] sickness and hardships but you're still
[55:16] here Paul speaks about it in the New
[55:19] Testament about our vile bodies and that
[55:22] word vile means the body of humiliation
[55:26] we have to go through those things but
[55:29] let me tell you tonight let me tell it
[55:31] against Satan and every demon Spirit you
[55:34] may try us you may make us sick you may
[55:37] prove us and all those things but one
[55:39] day we're come coming out of the Grave
[55:42] one day our bodies will be
[55:44] changed God promised us a Rapture and he
[55:46] says the glory of this latter house will
[55:50] be greater than the
[55:52] first oh you think it's something when
[55:55] the Holy Ghost struck your soul let me
[55:57] tell you the glory of this L house
[56:01] Hallelujah every cell of your body is
[56:03] going to be
[56:05] changed so don't let Satan belittle you
[56:08] my brother my sister you know that's
[56:10] what he always did if you are the Son of
[56:13] God change these stones into bread if
[56:16] you are the Son of God jump from the
[56:18] Pinnacle of the temple do something
[56:21] Supernatural and listen it was even so
[56:23] to say in the word of God
[56:32] but we have a prophet that's told us the
[56:35] Bride As thus sayith the Lord or she
[56:38] keeps
[56:40] quiet we we don't have to clown for the
[56:43] enemy that's right amen but he asked
[56:46] that question every time if you are the
[56:48] Son of God that's the question he is
[56:50] asking you day and night if you are a
[56:53] daughter of God you wouldn't have done
[56:55] this if you are a Son of God you
[56:57] wouldn't be in that place let me tell
[57:00] you that's the very evidence that God is
[57:02] inside of you
[57:04] hallelujah hallelujah if you didn't have
[57:07] God inside of you he wouldn't fight you
[57:10] the way he does
[57:13] hallelujah but you know those Spirits
[57:15] try to kill the fight in you belittling
[57:18] you saying you have no power you have no
[57:21] power against cancer you cannot do
[57:23] anything against depression and it's
[57:25] true but let me tell you my Lord my God
[57:29] hallelujah his glory it's not my glory
[57:32] His Glory Hallelujah can make every
[57:35] Cancer disappear his glory can heal
[57:39] those who are wounded in their body and
[57:41] in their
[57:43] mind Hallelujah
[57:46] Hallelujah Lord but you see God created
[57:49] men in his own image and we see what
[57:53] happened in the Garden of Eden Satan try
[57:56] to mingle animal life here is the vine
[58:01] uh theine life God made man in his own
[58:04] image but now we see Satan trying to
[58:07] belittle humanity and mixing animal life
[58:10] into the human race so his strategy from
[58:14] the beginning was to belittle the human
[58:18] race and you can I'm sorry I I if I hope
[58:22] I can just speak from my heart but you
[58:26] you have the quote where the Prophet
[58:28] says and Satan has had a marvelous
[58:32] success in in carrying out his
[58:35] threats
[58:36] right so so we are dealing with a real
[58:40] enemy don't underestimate your enemy
[58:44] right right that's
[58:46] right and we're saying that to Satan
[58:49] also don't under underestimate your
[58:52] enemy
[58:53] amen don't underestimate the sons and
[58:56] the daughters of God hallelujah GL and
[59:00] we see the way that Jesus conquered
[59:03] everyone of those three major trials in
[59:06] the desert was it is written yes amen it
[59:10] was not even a supernatural performance
[59:12] something we can show and oh he could
[59:15] have said the spirit of God is he could
[59:17] have let Fire come down from heaven but
[59:21] you know he just said it is written
[59:24] Hallelujah right yeah and finally when
[59:28] when he tempted him to jump off the
[59:29] mountain he says it is written Thou
[59:31] shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and
[59:34] Satan left him see the Bible says if you
[59:38] resist him he will flee from
[59:41] you that's right
[59:44] Hallelujah we see the same in the days
[59:46] of Moses here they are standing in front
[59:49] of the promised
[59:50] land like and and here the the 12 Spies
[59:54] come back and they are carrying those
[59:57] huge grape from the valley of escol and
[1:00:00] they're coming with the very evidence
[1:00:03] that what Moses what what the Lord spoke
[1:00:05] through Moses was the truth and here
[1:00:08] they're standing and and Caleb Still the
[1:00:12] people like they were saying yeah but
[1:00:14] the people are strong and they that
[1:00:16] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:00:18] walled it's all true true you might say
[1:00:21] well the doctor has made this diagnosis
[1:00:24] and it's all true and and and the walls
[1:00:27] are very great and we saw the children
[1:00:29] of anoch there and Caleb Still the
[1:00:32] people before Moses and he says let us
[1:00:35] go up at once and possess it for we are
[1:00:39] well able to overcome it here is a man
[1:00:42] and and the Bible says he had a
[1:00:44] different Spirit than all the
[1:00:46] rest
[1:00:48] Hallelujah Lord help us to be like Caleb
[1:00:51] even if people try to belittle what God
[1:00:53] is doing let some men stand up and say
[1:00:56] we are able to overcome we are well able
[1:01:00] to possess the
[1:01:02] land Hallelujah
[1:01:04] yes but the man that went up with him
[1:01:07] said we are not able to go up against
[1:01:10] the people do you see that Spirit of
[1:01:13] belittlement had grab taken a hold of
[1:01:17] those 10 spies so badly that they
[1:01:20] actually spoke exactly the opposite of
[1:01:24] what God spoke through
[1:01:28] Moses he had spoken every place that
[1:01:31] your
[1:01:32] foot will go on as your possession I
[1:01:36] have given to you there will there will
[1:01:38] be no man able to withstand you all the
[1:01:41] days of your life and here they're
[1:01:44] saying we cannot do it they are stronger
[1:01:46] than us we are not able to go and they
[1:01:49] brought an evil report of the land which
[1:01:53] they had searched unto the children of
[1:01:55] of Israel saying the land through which
[1:01:58] we have gone to search it listen closely
[1:02:02] and now at first they're saying it's a
[1:02:05] there is Walled cities the people are
[1:02:07] strong it sounds quite rational they're
[1:02:10] just looking at the thing but now it's
[1:02:12] getting worse the spirit is gripping
[1:02:18] them and he says we've gone through the
[1:02:20] land this is the same guys maybe the
[1:02:24] that that big big grave hanging on a
[1:02:26] staff is still on their
[1:02:29] shoulders they they still feel the
[1:02:31] weight and of the evidence that the Lord
[1:02:33] has given like brother sister God has
[1:02:36] given us so much evidence that it is a
[1:02:39] good land flowing with milk and
[1:02:43] honey God has given us so much Holy
[1:02:46] Ghost evidence that it is a good land
[1:02:50] Hallelujah but here are the people
[1:02:52] standing and and the weight of that
[1:02:54] grape on the should shoulder and and he
[1:02:57] says well the land we they say we've
[1:02:59] gone to search it and it is a land that
[1:03:02] listen closely it goes beyond the
[1:03:04] reasoning now Beyond IR rational it
[1:03:06] becomes very
[1:03:08] irrational it is a land that eateth up
[1:03:11] the inhabitants thereof where can you
[1:03:14] read it in the Bible like they're
[1:03:16] actually saying they're carnivors they
[1:03:18] eat each other but they you know they
[1:03:21] try to exaggerate and they say how bad
[1:03:24] it is and oh God help us that we never
[1:03:26] become negative let let our testimony
[1:03:29] never never be
[1:03:32] negative and they say they're not just
[1:03:34] eating the inhabitants but all the
[1:03:37] people that we saw it are men of great
[1:03:40] stature and we saw the Giants sons of
[1:03:42] anoch with come which come from the
[1:03:45] Giants and listen closely and we were in
[1:03:49] our own
[1:03:51] side this is the
[1:03:54] problem how do you look at yourself
[1:03:56] tonight how do we look at ourselves
[1:03:59] that's if we look with our own eyes it
[1:04:02] might be good it might be bad but I say
[1:04:05] Lord help us to look through your
[1:04:09] eyes and we were in our own side as
[1:04:13] grasshoppers right another exaggeration
[1:04:17] they're not just carnivors but we are
[1:04:19] like Grasshoppers and there the Giants
[1:04:22] are and so we were in their side
[1:04:26] I'm wondering did any one of those 10
[1:04:28] spies go and interview one of the sons
[1:04:31] of anoch so now they're speaking for the
[1:04:35] enemy and they haven't listen they're
[1:04:38] spies so they were not seen so they're
[1:04:40] actually lying they as if they could
[1:04:42] discern the thoughts of the
[1:04:45] enemy you can actually listen you can
[1:04:48] read the story of Rahab that it was
[1:04:50] exactly the opposite rightly right she
[1:04:54] said the fear the the Lord has gone
[1:04:56] before you here is RAB and the two spies
[1:04:59] are coming and the city was trembling
[1:05:03] already so it was a wrong discernment I
[1:05:07] say Lord help us to discern
[1:05:10] spirits and as I say oh I feel at home
[1:05:13] here
[1:05:14] tonight
[1:05:16] hallelujah praise the
[1:05:19] lord it's just like a Wednesday night at
[1:05:21] home th Thursday night here praise the
[1:05:24] Lord
[1:05:25] always tell the church back home if you
[1:05:27] want to exercise discernment start with
[1:05:30] your own
[1:05:31] mind see people want to point their
[1:05:34] fingers and to other churches and other
[1:05:36] brothers and sisters start with your own
[1:05:39] mind and I'm saying never
[1:05:41] stop don't you ever think you have
[1:05:44] arrived everyday this is the most
[1:05:47] deceiving
[1:05:49] time and that counts for all of us
[1:05:51] preachers and Lady
[1:05:54] likewise yes
[1:05:59] Hallelujah prise the Lord maybe we could
[1:06:01] call it autod
[1:06:03] discerners discern yourself a to
[1:06:06] discern you know David had David had
[1:06:09] that maturity he said Lord search me and
[1:06:12] try me try my heart and my Reigns see if
[1:06:16] there's any wicked way and bring me back
[1:06:18] on the right way help us Lord Jesus but
[1:06:22] they're saying we look in our eyes and
[1:06:24] and and in their eyes like
[1:06:27] grasshoppers sometimes we feel like this
[1:06:29] let me tell you if you feel like this
[1:06:31] it's a belittling
[1:06:34] spirit and let me tell you very
[1:06:36] straightforward it's a demon
[1:06:40] Spirit you know if Satan cannot lure you
[1:06:43] into sin like like smoking and drinking
[1:06:46] and and drugs or or sexual sin he will
[1:06:49] come another way more subtle with a
[1:06:51] belittling
[1:06:53] spirit let us say it like this
[1:06:56] well I believe the prophet said it I
[1:06:58] believe the word has said it but somehow
[1:07:01] I don't think it's for
[1:07:05] me you're speaking the mind of the
[1:07:08] enemy and it's a lie because the the
[1:07:11] reality is Satan is
[1:07:15] trembling he's
[1:07:16] trembling here is the prophet he says
[1:07:19] why did Jesus use the word in the
[1:07:21] wilderness Hallelujah so that the
[1:07:24] weakest believer among
[1:07:26] us can do the same
[1:07:28] thing maybe you cannot call fire from
[1:07:31] heaven maybe you cannot do all the grow
[1:07:34] great things but every one of us here
[1:07:36] tonight we can believe the word and say
[1:07:39] Satan it is
[1:07:42] written the weakest believer if he goes
[1:07:44] on his knees or her knees all hell is
[1:07:49] trembling Hallelujah if you start to
[1:07:53] pray all hell is trembling all of
[1:07:56] Jericho is
[1:07:58] trembling but here we see Israel going
[1:08:00] around the city walking and and they're
[1:08:03] not saying anything 6 days we know the
[1:08:06] story but there on the walls are are are
[1:08:10] the people remember God has discerned
[1:08:13] already that they're full of fear right
[1:08:17] right aren't we glad that we have a
[1:08:19] message that exposes the
[1:08:22] enemy that reveals the works of Satan
[1:08:25] amen and here they're marching and here
[1:08:28] are the soldiers and they are belittling
[1:08:31] the people they're standing on the high
[1:08:32] walls they feel so fortified but in the
[1:08:36] in inside of them their hearts are full
[1:08:39] of
[1:08:40] fear
[1:08:42] amen hallelujah and listen the people
[1:08:45] didn't do anything
[1:08:47] spectacular just walk with the
[1:08:51] word
[1:08:53] hallelujah six six days in the week it's
[1:08:57] not you not by might not by power but by
[1:09:00] my spirit it's not you who's who's going
[1:09:03] to produce the miracle it's mine the
[1:09:05] Lord says just walk with the Lord but I
[1:09:08] wish I could do signs and miracles just
[1:09:10] walk with the Lord just follow the ark
[1:09:13] just follow the word of God just do what
[1:09:16] the prophet tells you to do and let me
[1:09:19] tell you when it's time to shout the
[1:09:21] holy spirit will tell
[1:09:24] you
[1:09:25] Hallelujah listen not even Joshua not
[1:09:28] even the priest had to say it's time to
[1:09:30] shout God said now it's time to shout
[1:09:35] hallelujah good
[1:09:37] Hallelujah so don't let the enemy
[1:09:39] belittle you Satan is watching over
[1:09:42] those big walls from Hell let me tell
[1:09:45] you the smallest child in this church
[1:09:48] can conquer every enemy
[1:09:50] hallelujah hallelujah look at David
[1:09:53] versus Goliath wow and he's coming there

[1:09:59] prophet says a little Ruddy boy Ruddy
[1:10:02] old Ruddy looking boy and and here is
[1:10:06] elop and his anger was kindled and he
[1:10:09] says against David and he says why did

[1:10:19] sheep in the

[1:12:09] sister oh my it's getting a little bit
[1:12:12] more quiet
[1:12:13] [Laughter]
[1:12:18] now see Paul had to deal with that in
[1:12:21] the New Testament and he spoke to he he
[1:12:24] took time wrers in Timothy and he says
[1:12:27] let no man despise you right let no man
[1:12:31] belittle you because of your
[1:12:39] age I know what it's like to be young
[1:12:42] minister or what it's like to have been

[1:13:04] discernment he says I Know Thy Pride

[1:13:43] thumb crying going back to Daddy like
[1:13:47] Daddy you you commissioned me and they
[1:13:49] didn't believe me but daddy already sent
[1:13:52] them out because he knew he would
[1:13:54] accomplish the mission
[1:13:57] right
[1:14:04] Hallelujah you know let us preachers
[1:14:07] handle handle the thing we can handle it

[1:14:12] wants to use a simple brother that never
[1:14:14] will preach one
[1:14:16] sermon say Lord keep us humble
[1:14:26] and David said what have I now done is
[1:14:28] there not a cause and he turned from him
[1:14:30] to worth another listen closely it was
[1:14:33] not done yet this was like if democracy
[1:14:37] would be counting he would be voted
[1:14:41] out and he spake after the same matter
[1:14:44] and the people answered them again after
[1:14:46] the former matter the people said the
[1:14:49] same thing as aliab you little naughty
[1:14:52] curious boy go back back to the Sheep
[1:14:56] you know they would have voted him out
[1:14:58] completely if they would have a
[1:15:00] pastorial vote he wouldn't make it he
[1:15:03] wouldn't even have been a candidate
[1:15:05] listen this is
[1:15:07] me this is

[1:17:59] end of my spear I'll hang you up there
[1:18:02] in the tree and let the birds pick your
[1:18:05] flesh spirits of
[1:18:08] belittlement do do you fight the same

[1:19:05] world says anything else your defense is
[1:19:09] the Lord God of
[1:19:14] Israel words works is Faith expressed
[1:19:20] 65 and a little David standing there
[1:19:22] with a little piece of leather goat skin
[1:19:24] and or sheep skin with two pieces string
[1:19:27] tied to it but it was revealed to
[1:19:31] him Revelation struck him amen amen amen
[1:19:36] he said the god that took me out of the
[1:19:38] paws of the bear amen now he's looking
[1:19:41] back to his past victories you know the
[1:19:45] best way to withstand those spirits of
[1:19:47] belittlement is go back to your
[1:19:50] testimonies that's right go back to what
[1:19:53] the Lord has already done for you you
[1:19:55] that's right Hallelujah sir Hallelujah
[1:19:58] he says the same God that took me out of
[1:20:00] Paws of the lion he how much more will
[1:20:03] he deliver this
[1:20:06] uncircumcised uncircumcised Philistine
[1:20:08] in my hand amen yes his brothers way
[1:20:13] more able to do it Hallelujah there's
[1:20:16] people that are way more able to do it
[1:20:18] but God chose
[1:20:21] you head Soul Head and Shoulders above
[1:20:24] the Army but you see it wasn't revealed
[1:20:27] to
[1:20:29] them we're not any better than people
[1:20:32] out there in the denominations right
[1:20:35] we're not even better than the people
[1:20:37] out in the street and
[1:20:38] sin Hallelujah but God gave you and I a
[1:20:42] revelation
[1:20:44] am
[1:20:46] Hallelujah here it is they believed it
[1:20:49] could be done they believed that God
[1:20:51] could do it but it wasn't revealed to
[1:20:55] them
[1:20:56] amen see you can even come to the point
[1:20:59] where you know it can be done God can do
[1:21:02] it but it has to be revealed to you
[1:21:05] personally right so many people say well
[1:21:08] I believe what the prophet says but you
[1:21:10] have to you need a personal revelation I
[1:21:14] believe what Mom and Dad said but you
[1:21:15] need a personal
[1:21:17] revelation I believe what Brother Sam
[1:21:20] preaches well but you still need a
[1:21:22] personal revelation
[1:21:25] amen yeah but it's for everyone else in
[1:21:28] the church I'm not such a good believer
[1:21:30] you know what you're speaking the
[1:21:32] language of the
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:34] devil you are a good believer God only
[1:21:38] has good
[1:21:39] Believers
[1:21:42] Hallelujah Lord they believed it could
[1:21:44] be done believed that God could do it
[1:21:45] but it wasn't revealed to them it was
[1:21:48] revealed to David so here is the
[1:21:51] difference right there if it's
[1:21:53] absolutely revealed to you that God is
[1:21:56] going to heal
[1:21:58] you you're going to get it yes sir that
[1:22:02] sounds awful simple doesn't it but it is
[1:22:05] awful simple
[1:22:09] amen you're going to get it he I don't
[1:22:13] care what is wrong with you I'm still
[1:22:15] quoting what the odds it may be worse
[1:22:18] than David and Goliath Hallelujah I
[1:22:21] believe somebody needs that
[1:22:23] tonight he says notice when it's
[1:22:25] revealed David become
[1:22:30] Fearless
[1:22:32] Hallelujah Lord show it to us tonight
[1:22:35] Hallelujah reveal it to us that it's not
[1:22:38] for anyone else but it's for
[1:22:41] me he said today I'll cut your head off
[1:22:45] that's our God by grace in that crucial
[1:22:48] moment when decisions had to be made
[1:22:51] that same God that produced The Grace in
[1:22:53] that day and and dropped that seed of
[1:22:55] faith in that little Hunchback looking
[1:22:58] boy seeing his heart the same God at
[1:23:01] this in this crucial moment and he says
[1:23:05] could take the woman from the
[1:23:08] wheelchair the man he says with the
[1:23:10] heart trouble so now discernment starts
[1:23:13] I'm not a prophet I cannot discern but
[1:23:15] let me tell you the discerner is
[1:23:19] here no matter what your situation is he
[1:23:22] is he's saying to you I'm the same God
[1:23:25] that's right don't you look through
[1:23:27] those Giants tonight brother
[1:23:30] sister notice the Giant on the other
[1:23:33] side didn't believe it neither will the
[1:23:36] cancer he laughed and he said am I a dog
[1:23:39] that you sent this kid here to fight me
[1:23:42] he said I'll pick you up at the end of
[1:23:44] my Spear and let the birds eat your
[1:23:47] flesh why he had everything for his side
[1:23:51] Goliath but you see that didn't sh Shake
[1:23:54] David at
[1:23:57] all why it was revealed to him am am he
[1:24:02] had a faith in what he was doing he know
[1:24:06] he know he was going to do it and he did
[1:24:09] it it is because that it was revealed to
[1:24:11] him and he knowed where he was standing
[1:24:15] and if God would just spoke that right
[1:24:18] down in your heart
[1:24:21] tonight said you're not going to be
[1:24:23] laying in that bed you're not going to
[1:24:26] be sitting in that chair you're going to
[1:24:29] be well amen he says there couldn't be
[1:24:32] anything change your mind in it but
[1:24:34] until that's happened listen closely
[1:24:37] we're not done here yet every preacher
[1:24:40] in the world could pray I don't say it
[1:24:43] wouldn't help you it would it would
[1:24:45] encourage you right but he says see the
[1:24:48] healing power is in you
[1:24:55] Hallelujah he says it here it don't come
[1:24:59] from the
[1:25:01] preacher it comes to you by Revelation
[1:25:04] amen by faith not by might not by power
[1:25:09] but by my spirit sayeth the
[1:25:12] Lord he says here again in the greatest
[1:25:15] battle ever fought Satan following you
[1:25:18] all along that great big kingly Priestly
[1:25:21] Goliad trying to scare deliver out of
[1:25:26] you but he says you're
[1:25:29] fortified amen with the gospel the word
[1:25:32] of Truth around your Lo preacher that's
[1:25:35] what it is helmet of salvation Shield of
[1:25:38] faith and a sword waving in your hand
[1:25:41] Satan I'm coming to meet
[1:25:44] you you meet me in the name of Science
[1:25:47] and culture organization this that or
[1:25:50] the other but I meet you in the name of
[1:25:52] the Lord God of Israel
[1:25:55] I'm coming after you give way even death
[1:25:59] itself cannot stay there chop a hole
[1:26:02] right through
[1:26:04] it say Lord help us tonight to chop some
[1:26:09] holes Hallelujah through those lineages
[1:26:12] of spirits that try to belittle
[1:26:17] you
[1:26:19] yes the Lord
[1:26:22] hallelujah you see Satan is always
[1:26:25] trying to discredit the word of God he's
[1:26:29] always tried to
[1:26:31] depreciate the word of God to dishonor
[1:26:35] everyone that re and and it's not just
[1:26:37] I'm not just speaking about the word of
[1:26:39] God here the Bible but the word of God
[1:26:42] that is inside you my brother he's
[1:26:44] always there to belittle it if you are
[1:26:46] the Son of God if you are a daughter of
[1:26:49] God then you wouldn't do this
[1:26:54] that's that's his his strategy in the
[1:26:57] Garden of Eden did God really say it and
[1:27:00] he's still the same but Jesus showed it
[1:27:02] in and coming in a human flesh that it
[1:27:05] could be conquered in a very simple and
[1:27:08] Powerful way it is written that's right
[1:27:10] yes I say Lord tonight if there's
[1:27:13] somebody in a slave mentality is there
[1:27:16] some somebody in a cage mentality it is
[1:27:19] the result of listening to Satan's
[1:27:22] preaching right those spirits that try
[1:27:25] to belittle you to the ground as if
[1:27:28] you're nothing let me tell you you're
[1:27:30] created in the image of God himself in
[1:27:33] his likeness Hallelujah your body is a
[1:27:36] temple of the Holy Spirit hallelujah
[1:27:39] it's not a cage for demon spirit it's
[1:27:42] not a cage for unclean Birds your body
[1:27:45] is a temple of the holy
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:51] spirit so I'm saying
[1:27:54] let us not allow the enemy to despise
[1:27:58] what is inside of us let's not allow
[1:28:01] Satan to despise the Lord God the holy
[1:28:04] spirit that lives inside you it's not
[1:28:06] even yourself God lives inside of you
[1:28:11] Hallelujah he says here in what went you
[1:28:13] out to see he says you can be too humble
[1:28:16] you can get so humble until the devil
[1:28:19] would make a puppet out of
[1:28:22] you isn't that something
[1:28:25] you know the devil can come with false
[1:28:27] humility well it's for everybody else
[1:28:29] but I'm not there yet you know well well
[1:28:33] we I believe those things but maybe it's
[1:28:35] not for me see we can get so humble and
[1:28:38] the devil just kicks you
[1:28:40] around see he says Jesus was uh humble
[1:28:44] enough to wash the disciples the
[1:28:46] disciples
[1:28:47] feet he was forgiven enough to pray for
[1:28:51] those who drove the spikes into his
[1:28:53] hands but he was also man enough to
[1:28:56] Plate robes and run the money changers
[1:28:59] out of the
[1:29:01] house Amen Let us be like Daddy Let the
[1:29:05] sons and the daughters be like Daddy
[1:29:08] Hallelujah that lamb nature and the lion
[1:29:11] nature that we know that when to be a
[1:29:13] lamb and when to be a
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:17] lion Hallelujah you you can read it in
[1:29:20] questions and answers 54 that brother
[1:29:23] random public and the pulpit is saying
[1:29:25] he was correcting brother nville and he
[1:29:27] says I don't want to hurt his feelings
[1:29:31] there in the in the Tabernacle but he
[1:29:33] says brother naville is so so humble but
[1:29:36] sometimes he a little bit too humble he
[1:29:39] doesn't want to say it ride out directly
[1:29:41] and say Lord help us as pastors amen
[1:29:44] that we're not coming in the name of
[1:29:46] humility and that we're shering our
[1:29:49] responsibilities but that we can really
[1:29:51] lay there and say this is right this is
[1:29:54] wrong but sometimes as pastors that is
[1:29:57] instilled in our nature as pastors we
[1:29:59] don't want conflict we don't want to
[1:30:02] hurt people's
[1:30:06] feelings and and and you know he he's
[1:30:09] speaking about that there in that same
[1:30:12] message in the law having a shadow he
[1:30:14] says and and and that he could discern
[1:30:17] that brother Neville thought that this
[1:30:19] is Brother Bill's Tabernacle brother
[1:30:21] brenham's Tabernacle so he was he didn't
[1:30:24] have the freedom to move he says and
[1:30:27] brother venam says very clearly it is
[1:30:29] God's
[1:30:31] Tabernacle Hallelujah this is God's
[1:30:34] house this is God's Tabernacle and he it
[1:30:38] says he's the shepherd put in full
[1:30:40] charge so he's saying brother Neville
[1:30:42] you have to take your full Liberty right
[1:30:46] Hallelujah Lord help us to not pull any
[1:30:50] punches
[1:30:54] so it doesn't matter our age our
[1:30:56] background doesn't matter our status in
[1:30:59] society Satan will always try to
[1:31:01] belittle you he will say with this words
[1:31:04] you're
[1:31:05] too dot dot dot you're too young you're
[1:31:09] too old you're too experienced you're
[1:31:12] too inexperienced you're too nervous
[1:31:15] you're too calm you know it's using
[1:31:18] anything anything even if it's
[1:31:21] completely the opposite you're too young
[1:31:22] you're too old
[1:31:25] that's
[1:31:27] good I always wonder about those who
[1:31:30] want a job and then they get as a reason
[1:31:32] you're not experienced enough imagine
[1:31:35] you're going for a first job how can I
[1:31:37] ever get
[1:31:41] experienced
[1:31:43] right but he's telling you that you come
[1:31:46] you want to do something for the Lord
[1:31:48] You're not experienced enough well get
[1:31:50] into it jump into it it's a a good
[1:31:52] experience
[1:31:56] wonder you're too
[1:31:57] simple you're too
[1:32:00] educated you know this is not the moment
[1:32:04] wait till later and then the next time
[1:32:06] he says well you've had your moment but
[1:32:08] it's pasted you know what he's he's he's
[1:32:11] trying to belittle you it's always
[1:32:14] something behind or in front of you but
[1:32:16] what about
[1:32:19] today I'm going to tell you what about
[1:32:21] today 1 John 3:2 beloved but now are we
[1:32:25] the sons of God hallelujah now are you
[1:32:29] the daughters of God now are you
[1:32:31] Victorious everything that God was he
[1:32:34] poured into Christ everything that
[1:32:36] Christ was he poured into the
[1:32:40] church that's power
[1:32:43] powerful Hallelujah I'm skipping a whole
[1:32:46] lot of things here hallelujah
[1:32:55] he says here
[1:33:00] what he says here in questions and
[1:33:02] answers this is one of my favorites uh
[1:33:05] before we close here he says isn't that
[1:33:08] just the the way the people get today
[1:33:10] let God just bless a fellow and put a
[1:33:12] little confidence in him and he gets to
[1:33:15] be a no it all he's got to start an
[1:33:18] organization or something that's
[1:33:21] different why are thou fallen from from
[1:33:24] Heaven oh Lucifer that's strong
[1:33:27] language yes it is he says God has a
[1:33:30] hard time to cry trying to get somebody
[1:33:33] that he can deal with that will stay
[1:33:38] humble and meek and stay in the place
[1:33:40] until God calls him to do something
[1:33:43] right that we can stay there just do
[1:33:47] nothing and I'm not meaning you know
[1:33:49] being passive but just waiting on the
[1:33:51] Lord till he speaks so God God has a
[1:33:54] hard time to stay somebody can stay in
[1:33:56] that place till God calls him to do
[1:33:58] something you believe that he says a man
[1:34:01] that God can bless and he will still
[1:34:04] keep himself a
[1:34:06] man not be an angel or a God and as soon
[1:34:11] man as man gets blessed and has a little
[1:34:14] something given to him he wants to
[1:34:17] become a God he wants to become an angel
[1:34:20] he wants to become some great person
[1:34:24] he says what I do Me Mine when you hear
[1:34:28] that language he says that's the wrong
[1:34:29] attitude God is hunting for somebody who
[1:34:33] he could bless and pour out the
[1:34:34] blessings and the more He blesses the
[1:34:37] little the man will become see the
[1:34:41] belittlement of Satan has nothing to do
[1:34:43] with
[1:34:44] humility the the Bible says if you abase
[1:34:48] yourself you shall be exalted he that
[1:34:50] humbles himself shall be exalted but he
[1:34:54] that exalteth himself shall be a
[1:35:03] based he ISS you're in God's covenant
[1:35:06] with Abraham and his seed Jesus
[1:35:08] constantly said fear not fear not I am
[1:35:12] he that was dead and live alive forever
[1:35:15] more fear not fear not it's it's like we
[1:35:18] started out in the book of Hagi he's
[1:35:21] saying don't you
[1:35:22] fear Hallelujah don't you fear the glory
[1:35:25] of this L house shall be greater the
[1:35:28] power of the third pool will be so much
[1:35:30] greater than all that this publical
[1:35:33] spectacle it's but people look now and
[1:35:36] see the third pool is so secret and so
[1:35:39] intimate and so personal that if we were
[1:35:42] not
[1:35:43] careful we belittle what God is doing
[1:35:47] today we could go into the depth but
[1:35:50] listen you know the test tent Vision you
[1:35:52] know that little w wooden building and
[1:35:54] every individual went alone with God it
[1:35:57] was not it was not the whole
[1:35:59] congregation in the wooden building but
[1:36:01] just it's you and I with the Lord in
[1:36:03] that secret place and as soon as the
[1:36:06] prophet comes out of that Vision the
[1:36:08] angel came with the
[1:36:09] Scripture it is written Matthew 6 Jesus
[1:36:13] said if you want to pray go into your
[1:36:16] room in your closet close the door and
[1:36:19] the god that seeth in secret will answer
[1:36:23] public but people try to turn it
[1:36:26] around the god that see it publicly will
[1:36:29] answer you in secret that's not what he
[1:36:31] said Jesus said you go you alone talk it
[1:36:35] over with the Lord he's going to solve
[1:36:38] your problems
[1:36:39] amen he's going to answer your prayers
[1:36:42] the secrets of your heart and he's going
[1:36:44] to reward you P publicly for
[1:36:48] it so the angel was always
[1:36:51] scriptural but if we're not careful we
[1:36:53] look to it and we still want the
[1:36:55] spectacle we still want the public part
[1:36:58] and the angel said you cannot explain it
[1:37:01] it will not be a public show that's
[1:37:03] right amen help us Lord to stay
[1:37:07] humble amen help us to stay
[1:37:14] humble you will often see people with
[1:37:16] the complex will try to elevate him
[1:37:19] themselves and try to belittle others so
[1:37:23] very very like look to elab the brother
[1:37:26] of David and we are really dealing with
[1:37:29] some things here tonight it was actually
[1:37:31] because he knew on the inside he was he
[1:37:35] was so sour because he was so
[1:37:38] frustrated he didn't have the answer to
[1:37:41] the
[1:37:42] problem he was a big
[1:37:45] coward and here is a little Shepherd boy
[1:37:48] and all all of all his belittlement just
[1:37:51] expressed his complex that was bigger
[1:37:54] than
[1:37:56] Goliath right he had a huge complex Al
[1:37:59] and the old of the people of of you you
[1:38:02] can tell people with you know I'm I'm
[1:38:04] not a psychologist but I'm a pastor like
[1:38:07] people with minority complex can hurt so
[1:38:10] many other
[1:38:11] people right and and and it's it sounds
[1:38:14] so strange because people that want to
[1:38:17] elevate themselves and show how much
[1:38:20] they are and sometimes it's a complex of
[1:38:22] I didn't have Ed ucation and and and the
[1:38:25] prophet wasn't immune to
[1:38:27] it we are not immune to it I'm not
[1:38:30] immune to
[1:38:37] it but the Lord is saying don't you fear
[1:38:40] the glory of this Lea house shall be
[1:38:43] greater that's what the prophet says
[1:38:45] this this third pool if you've seen it m
[1:38:48] manifested
[1:38:50] temporarily it will not be used in a
[1:38:52] greater way until the pressure comes you
[1:38:55] wonder how much more pressure will have
[1:38:57] to come but let me tell you the third
[1:39:00] pool has never been
[1:39:02] inactive it's always active brother
[1:39:04] sister whether we see it where whether
[1:39:07] we feel it or whatever it's nothing to
[1:39:09] do with it let's not be literal let's
[1:39:12] not this is not returning back to
[1:39:15] discernment with the hands and laying on
[1:39:18] on the F no no no God is going further
[1:39:20] that's right and and the prophet is
[1:39:23] trying to show it time after time he's
[1:39:25] showing he he in in one sermon in 64 I
[1:39:29] believe he says nobody comes up to you
[1:39:31] to the Altar and then he calls the
[1:39:33] people and and then he starts to discern
[1:39:36] now they can see wow he's Discerning and
[1:39:38] the altar is full and now he's saying
[1:39:40] you're
[1:39:41] deceived see we want a sign and so many
[1:39:44] times the discernment comes but he says
[1:39:47] God is healing much more people out
[1:39:49] there so he's trying to teach us
[1:39:51] something there's nothing wrong with an
[1:39:53] altar there's nothing wrong with laying
[1:39:55] on of hands but Paul says I will show
[1:39:58] you a more excellent
[1:40:01] way so let us not allow the devil to
[1:40:04] belittle our experience amen but he says
[1:40:08] it's it's you out there you believe
[1:40:10] there not even with in perfect Faith he
[1:40:14] says it literally like this if you would
[1:40:16] believe if you would have perfect Faith
[1:40:18] you wouldn't even be in the prayer line
[1:40:20] right amen amen yes sir I always tell
[1:40:24] the people every service you can have a
[1:40:26] prayer line it's always open you can
[1:40:28] always come to the altar when the Lord
[1:40:30] calls you
[1:40:32] amen right but there is a faith a
[1:40:35] perfect faith that goes beyond that that
[1:40:37] you listen to the word of God is being
[1:40:40] revealed to you like David Hall and you
[1:40:43] receive it and it changes your
[1:40:46] life that's what we're going into but
[1:40:49] now we see people looking at it it looks
[1:40:51] too simple it looks too humble the third
[1:40:54] pool it should look simple it should
[1:40:57] look
[1:40:58] humble praise the
[1:41:02] Lord trying to find a close
[1:41:05] here God's covenant with Abraham and I
[1:41:08] see Jesus said constantly fear not fear
[1:41:11] not so that's what he said to the people
[1:41:13] in the time of haga don't you fear I've
[1:41:17] got this I've I've got everything in my
[1:41:19] hands I've got a greater glory waiting
[1:41:22] and which he's actually saying I do this
[1:41:25] on purpose so that your eyes are not on
[1:41:28] a big nice building with gold and and
[1:41:31] the and Solomon coming out in all of his
[1:41:36] glory there is a greater than Solomon
[1:41:38] here
[1:41:40] tonight
[1:41:42] hallelujah
[1:41:43] hallelujah and he's saying I'm I do this
[1:41:46] on purpose that there is a smaller
[1:41:48] Temple because it's not about the
[1:41:51] building it's it's not about how safe we
[1:41:54] feel in the building and how big the
[1:41:56] building is God is actually saying I
[1:41:58] want to show my glory and I want all the
[1:42:01] glory to come back to me not to a
[1:42:03] building or a man that's standing there
[1:42:07] and I'm saying tonight all the glory
[1:42:09] only belongs to you Jesus
[1:42:13] amen
[1:42:16] amen and he says fear not I am with you
[1:42:18] always even to the end of the world and
[1:42:21] the Christian he says keep sitting back
[1:42:23] oh I just wonder he says oh my turn
[1:42:26] loose amen get all these things away
[1:42:30] from you say Satan Mr Satan you are
[1:42:34] defeated Hallelujah Jesus Christ

[2:02:42] say this before we go I'm going to tell
[2:02:43] you what brother Bill my friend overseas
[2:02:46] all these years going all these trips
[2:02:48] I'm not a missionary but I'm going say
[2:02:51] quote him cuz when we hit hard times
[2:02:54] overseas and I get suck on the food and
[2:02:56] all these other things happen he's got
[2:02:58] one statement brother Paul we go
[2:03:01] forward we go
[2:03:05] forward I want to say it tonight we go
[2:03:08] forward there's a greater glory that he
[2:03:11] has promised us and we're holding on to
[2:03:19] that amen amen are you happy in the Lord
[2:03:24] tonight amen hallelujah I tell you this
[2:03:28] the message of the hour amen is an
[2:03:31] encouraging message yes because when
[2:03:34] when when God comes and he deals with
[2:03:37] he'll deal with sin he deal with
[2:03:38] unbelief he'll deal with things but it
[2:03:40] but it never is to get us to look at
[2:03:42] ourselves it's always to see him that
[2:03:47] the answer he's already made a way
[2:03:50] that's right that's right you remember
[2:03:52] when like brother B said when that when
[2:03:53] that Mama Eagle came over that that
[2:03:55] barnyard he said that that little Eagle
[2:03:58] had always been taught to look
[2:04:01] down but it's when that eagle begin to
[2:04:04] come is it learned you can't look down
[2:04:08] and ever go up right but here came an
[2:04:11] eagle and brother Braham said it like
[2:04:12] this in Rising in the sun he said that's
[2:04:14] why in this day it would take more than
[2:04:16] a picture or more than just a sermon on
[2:04:18] Eagles it would take a living eagle to
[2:04:21] come flying
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:24] over that's what this message is it's
[2:04:27] Christ that has passed over our lives
[2:04:30] man that's who we really are that's our
[2:04:32] real identity amen I'll tell you the
[2:04:34] word of the Lord was so rich
[2:04:37] tonight and you know when you you yeah
[2:04:40] you don't even really you don't have
[2:04:41] words to describe it because we're
[2:04:42] living in that hour where the the
[2:04:46] Declaration is who has despised the day
[2:04:49] of small things
[2:04:52] uh because there's things that when we
[2:04:54] look at that even on that of the third
[2:04:57] poll Remember When U Leo and Jean they
[2:05:00] had mentioned to brother Brown brother
[2:05:01] Bram is it going to be we're going to be
[2:05:02] going in and emptying out
[2:05:04] hospitals brother Bram said oh no no no
[2:05:07] no no no see it's looking back to a
[2:05:10] former glory but see God continues to
[2:05:13] come forward and he said he said I want
[2:05:15] you to do it like this he said I want
[2:05:17] you to write it in the journal and put
[2:05:20] it up because someday
[2:05:22] he said you can get it back out and read
[2:05:24] it and he said this is what I want you
[2:05:25] to write he said that the ministry of
[2:05:28] this third pool will not be so much a
[2:05:31] change in the ministry as it will be a
[2:05:33] change in
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:36] me that's what this word come to do it
[2:05:40] not only come to bring a real true birth
[2:05:44] in our lives but then that same word
[2:05:46] working to mold the very character of
[2:05:49] Christ in our lives amen bringing us all
[2:05:52] the way till eventually that final
[2:05:55] moment when we're Swept Away amen we are
[2:05:58] people of the change people of the open
[2:06:00] book is that right amen so oh how I
[2:06:04] thank God for his mercies tonight amen

[2:06:14] amen praise be the name of the Lord amen
[2:06:18] belittling Spirits you can't stay that's
[2:06:21] right

[2:06:26] go oh my I tell you the word of the Lord
[2:06:29] was so rich brother David God bless you
[2:06:31] amen amen God bless you
[2:06:34] tonight
[2:06:36] amen amen just so good to be able to
[2:06:39] gather around the Throne of the Lord
[2:06:40] tonight and we just want to pray for
[2:06:42] Brother David he's got the meetings
[2:06:44] there with brother Paul this weekend I
[2:06:46] think on Saturday is it Saturday or just
[2:06:49] two on Sunday
[2:06:52] Su 5:00 okay Sunday at the Tri-State
[2:06:56] youth meeting at 5:00 and U so we want
[2:07:00] to pray for them as well for Brother
[2:07:02] David Lord will just give his brother
[2:07:04] strength because he's he was there at
[2:07:05] the men's meeting last weekend and he
[2:07:07] preached at brother Barry's last night
[2:07:08] and flew up here today just got off the
[2:07:10] plane and came here so we certainly
[2:07:13] appreciate the sacrifice amen and uh I
[2:07:16] told you you're at home and you really
[2:07:18] are home you're you're you're at home
[2:07:21] amen we certainly want Brother David to
[2:07:23] come
[2:07:23] back
[2:07:26] amen you see I I don't know about you
[2:07:29] but for me this is how I feel it's just
[2:07:30] like if somebody blesses my boys and
[2:07:33] they're a help to them man I I
[2:07:36] appreciate that and to me that's what I
[2:07:38] look at with Ministry is is I want
[2:07:41] Ministry that edifies the body amen yes
[2:07:44] amen I I mean there there's there's an
[2:07:46] impact when we're gone it it's something
[2:07:48] that the word has been delivered that
[2:07:50] just hasn't taking us there but it's a
[2:07:52] word that's come into our lives and it
[2:07:54] it'll move us because what it all comes
[2:07:56] down to is after every amen has said
[2:08:00] it's now time for the word to become
[2:08:03] flesh oh yes and I can tell you was
[2:08:06] preached on tonight we feel that
[2:08:08] liberating atmosphere as we enter into
[2:08:10] the word of God and what it is the word
[2:08:12] of God was actually casting away those
[2:08:15] belittling
[2:08:16] Spirits now I'm going to say this to you
[2:08:19] and because you know it as soon as come
[2:08:21] out of here the enemy is going to be
[2:08:23] waiting but I want you to remember the
[2:08:26] same God that belittled him in the
[2:08:31] presence of God he's just as much God
[2:08:34] when that belittling Spirit wants to
[2:08:36] whisper to you amen say Lord I take what
[2:08:38] you spoke to my heart and I refuse to go
[2:08:42] back oh
[2:08:44] my aren't you glad that God sees Great
[2:08:47] Value in our lives not in this flesh
[2:08:50] when God first got a hold of me it
[2:08:52] wasn't in my flesh that he saw Great
[2:08:53] Value as a matter of fact in my flesh
[2:08:55] there was a lot that said give him just
[2:08:57] a week give him just a little bit he's
[2:08:59] been to camps before there was even
[2:09:02] things that got out got back to me oh
[2:09:04] his daddy and them just took him and
[2:09:05] brainwashed him but you see God saw the
[2:09:08] gold on the
[2:09:10] inside God saw the silver on the inside
[2:09:12] that he had placed there from before the
[2:09:15] foundation the world and God knows how
[2:09:16] to bring out what he's placed in
[2:09:19] US sometimes it is sometimes there's
[2:09:22] things that God it'll come all out all
[2:09:24] at once a change right away but then
[2:09:27] sometimes it's little by little by
[2:09:31] little to me however it is it still
[2:09:34] takes God bringing
[2:09:35] change amen that's why we do not despise
[2:09:39] the day of small
[2:09:41] things I rejoice in every inch I rejoice
[2:09:44] in that little pinky like brother Bram
[2:09:46] said just move the pinky and eventually
[2:09:47] you'll be moving the hand then the arm
[2:09:49] and then the body just just just move
[2:09:51] the pinky and and you'll get going is
[2:09:53] that right it might be in your life
[2:09:54] tonight it might just be a a pinky in
[2:09:56] obedience just keep moving that and say
[2:09:58] thank you Lord for that movement you
[2:09:59] keep going with that finally it's the
[2:10:01] hand then it's the arm then then it's
[2:10:03] the body amen don't you love him my my
[2:10:06] my amen let's just bow our heads in a
[2:10:09] word of prayer and could we just all
