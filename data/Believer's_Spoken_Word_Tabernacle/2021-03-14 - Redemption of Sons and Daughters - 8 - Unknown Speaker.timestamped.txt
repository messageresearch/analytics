[37:03] way
[37:04] you place it but i believe god's still
[37:07] god
[37:09] god is still god the scripture one of
[37:12] the greatest titles
[37:13] of all the titles that all descriptive
[37:15] of him but he said he's the lily of the
[37:17] valley
[37:19] and you know what that means to be the
[37:20] lily of the valley
[37:22] there's no opium like jesus
[37:26] there's no one that can take away the
[37:28] sting of sin there's no one that can
[37:30] take away
[37:31] pain like he can amen and we are
[37:35] witnesses of that so we just
[37:36] we want to lift our brother in prayer

[37:46] you know she's in a process of recovery
[37:48] and you know if you don't see
[37:51] sister shirley here in church because
[37:52] she's set here time and time again
[37:55] in pain and you don't see her in church
[37:58] then you know that there's
[37:59] it's something that's kind of really
[38:01] beyond within the pain and things but
[38:03] you just lift our sister up in prayer
[38:06] and i'll tell you just how i've been
[38:07] praying
[38:08] she had that hip replacement and i've
[38:10] just asked god i said god let there be a
[38:12] fusing and a united
[38:14] if you took bread and you created
[38:18] lord then you can take this right here
[38:20] god and bring
[38:21] a fusing and a creation to where that
[38:25] just becomes
[38:25] one with her body say brother samuel you
[38:28] don't believe i believe that with all my
[38:30] heart
[38:31] i believe that god can supply a hip
[38:33] where there's no heal
[38:35] amen we are living in the moment in the
[38:38] time that he is still the same
[38:41] yesterday today and forever
[38:44] amen where there was no eyes he created
[38:47] eyes
[38:50] amen he's the same god
[38:53] is he not where death was in our life
[38:57] he came and he went from death
[39:00] to life went from darkness to life
[39:04] he's still the same god
[39:06] [Music]

[42:07] lord your present here lord god
[42:10] we give you the praise honor glory in
[42:13] jesus name
[42:16] let's turn in our bibles to first john
[42:18] chapter four
[42:20] say thank the musicians
[42:30] john chapter 4 and we're just going to
[42:31] read a few verses of scripture here
[42:34] beginning at verse 7.
[42:38] beloved let us love one another
[42:43] for love is of god
[42:47] and everyone that loveth is born of god
[42:51] and knoweth god now we realize that
[42:54] when we're reading the scripture we
[42:56] don't read it like a newspaper
[42:59] but there must the author himself
[43:01] there's an inspiration the holy spirit
[43:04] must come
[43:05] upon that word and so we recognize this
[43:07] for god
[43:09] is love for love is of god
[43:12] now there's a lot that can be said or
[43:15] many can say well i love or i love or i
[43:18] love but this is speaking of
[43:20] god himself this is not a love that
[43:24] where
[43:25] we love those who love us and don't love
[43:28] those who don't love us
[43:30] it goes even deeper than that this is a
[43:32] love
[43:33] that reaches to such depth that
[43:36] they love god and
[43:40] he is the word
[43:43] notice this he that loveth not knoweth
[43:47] not
[43:47] god for god is love in this
[43:51] was manifested the love of god toward us
[43:55] because that god sent his only begotten
[43:58] son
[43:58] into the world that we might live
[44:02] through him so this is what this love is
[44:05] to do
[44:06] is to give us life
[44:09] now i'm looking around and every one of
[44:13] us you're standing here this morning
[44:15] you're a lie you you have you have life
[44:18] here this morning
[44:19] natural life he's not speaking of
[44:22] natural life
[44:23] he's speaking of spiritual life he's
[44:26] speaking of
[44:27] that which is true life
[44:32] hearing is love not that we love god
[44:36] but that he loved us and sent
[44:39] his son to be the propitiation for
[44:42] our sins beloved if god so loved us
[44:46] we ought also to love one another
[44:50] no man hath seen god at any time
[44:53] if we love one another god dwelleth in
[44:56] us
[44:57] and his love is perfected
[45:00] in us i want you to think of this phrase
[45:02] here
[45:03] and his love is perfected
[45:06] in us hereby know we
[45:10] that we dwell in him and he and us
[45:13] because
[45:14] he hath given us of his
[45:18] spirit his spirit
[45:21] is his life is his love
[45:26] oh my may god bless you bless the
[45:28] reading of the word as you're being
[45:29] seated
[45:31] i want to just continue to
[45:35] dealing with this thought on the
[45:37] redemption of sons and daughters of god
[45:39] as we've been looking at it
[45:41] and i want to just begin here this
[45:43] morning in looking
[45:45] to record as we look in the scriptures
[45:48] we started into this a little
[45:49] last week but seeing
[45:52] that the love of god that has come
[45:56] to us in order to set us free because
[45:59] the real
[46:00] walk of a believer is a walk
[46:03] of a love affair between them and god
[46:07] it's it's not a law if it if it's
[46:10] no more than just a law the heart is not
[46:13] really right
[46:14] even though a person within can do
[46:17] everything seemingly all the t's are
[46:19] crossed and the eyes are dotted but if
[46:21] it's not from the heart
[46:24] it's not even accepted it's got to be
[46:27] from the heart
[46:28] and this is what god comes to work on
[46:31] because as the scripture says here not
[46:34] that
[46:34] we loved god but god
[46:37] loved us you see god's love was so great
[46:40] to where where the scriptures could say
[46:43] in first uh on colossians it would say
[46:47] when we were we were enemies in our
[46:50] minds not speaking of this
[46:52] this is not what he's speaking of in our
[46:54] souls
[46:55] we were enemies unto god
[46:58] romans would would paul would write that
[47:00] in romans as well
[47:02] when we were enemies but yet god himself
[47:05] commended his
[47:06] love to us that he died for us
[47:10] so then we come to the place to
[47:12] recognize there's there's a whole
[47:13] purpose
[47:14] it's a whole reason there's a reason and
[47:17] a purpose
[47:18] of this of the whole sacrificial
[47:22] death burial and resurrection of the
[47:24] lord jesus christ
[47:26] as he come in order to loosen you and i
[47:30] that we might come to life and come back
[47:33] to serve the real purpose
[47:35] that he ordained for our life
[47:39] and so he come to break the hold of
[47:42] change you see
[47:44] many of these things when we look at
[47:46] this of god's love there's examples and
[47:48] i want to
[47:49] just look at this of how brother brown
[47:51] would take us through this in this
[47:53] message and i'm going to refer to this
[47:55] this quote here and and just read
[47:57] through some things within this quote
[47:59] because it's very pertaining
[48:00] to the time even that we're living in
[48:03] right now
[48:04] and brother bannon would he would speak
[48:05] of how and he's dealing with the part of
[48:07] where when god brought
[48:09] israel out of egypt by a promise
[48:13] god sent his word and remember he sent
[48:17] his word
[48:18] by his prophet when it came
[48:21] time for israel to be delivered god
[48:25] god called his ordained man
[48:28] to the side and god revealed himself
[48:32] to moses now listen to me moses
[48:35] knew the promise
[48:39] but just knowing it did not have
[48:42] power but once he met
[48:45] the god who made the promise
[48:49] it took a man who ran from things when
[48:52] it didn't go right
[48:54] it brought a courage in him because he
[48:57] knew
[48:57] now where he was standing the ground
[49:00] that he was now standing
[49:02] on was more sure than
[49:05] even the ground he was standing on are
[49:07] you with me
[49:08] because the bible said heaven and earth
[49:10] shall pass away
[49:12] but my word shall never fail
[49:16] so god comes to position moses
[49:19] in the word reveals himself
[49:23] i am the word and moses goes forth
[49:26] to proclaim that word and then we find
[49:29] israel comes out under the authority of
[49:32] that word
[49:33] and they come to this place in the
[49:35] wilderness and
[49:36] we realize here now where there's a
[49:39] failure there's a fault there's a
[49:41] falling that takes place where they make
[49:44] another god here they are they begin to
[49:47] make a molten calf like what they've
[49:48] seen in
[49:49] in in in egypt and they are making it to
[49:52] say
[49:53] well moses isn't here well let's just go
[49:55] on back let's let's go on back
[49:57] you see in the midst of that time you as
[50:00] a bible reader you're aware of what took
[50:02] place
[50:03] god himself would have wiped israel
[50:06] out because listen let me listen to me
[50:10] very clearly
[50:11] israel it wasn't that they were ignorant
[50:14] of this
[50:14] god had said in a previous chapters
[50:18] make no other gods
[50:23] but god in his mercy in his mercy
[50:27] you see listen failure to obey the word
[50:30] results in judgment this god's a just
[50:34] god as much as he suggests god for any
[50:37] other promise of his word
[50:39] he listen that's what makes him a just
[50:41] god he will
[50:42] always come according to his word if a
[50:44] life doesn't come up to the word
[50:46] and they forsake the word judgment comes
[50:49] true is that right but here you find
[50:53] moses
[50:54] he steps in the way of the wrath of god
[50:58] that word is burning in his heart
[51:02] a word of a promise that i will bring
[51:04] you out
[51:05] and bring you into the land of promise
[51:08] into
[51:09] your inheritance into the place where it
[51:12] can be
[51:12] revealed of who you really are and so
[51:15] there must be a word
[51:18] that is present a revelation you see
[51:20] this is why
[51:21] revelation is so important revelation
[51:25] has prevailing power
[51:27] revelation holds the mercy of god
[51:30] revelation holds wisdom
[51:31] and let me be very clear as i always
[51:33] have revelation
[51:35] is not knowledge of this earth
[51:39] revelation is not something you find out
[51:42] or
[51:42] figure out by probing and countless
[51:45] hours of reading
[51:46] it takes a sovereign work of
[51:49] god revelation is sovereignly
[51:53] given by god
[51:56] matter of fact brother branham in
[51:58] questions and answers 54
[52:00] he says this is what causes many mental
[52:02] breakups
[52:03] is people trying to press into things
[52:05] instead of
[52:06] yielding themselves to god he said they
[52:09] study themselves
[52:10] into breakups and it's not that we're
[52:12] not there's nothing we're not to read
[52:14] or study but it's to recognize it must
[52:17] be
[52:18] god who comes and reveals his word as
[52:21] we give ourselves to the word
[52:25] so now with this setting here moses said
[52:29] god you're going to have to step over me
[52:32] in order to get to them
[52:36] that was a type because all through the
[52:38] scriptures there are
[52:40] tights that speak of the lord jesus
[52:43] of the new birth it's all the way
[52:45] through the scripture
[52:47] it's it's one the the bible is one
[52:51] great uh book of redemption that speaks
[52:54] of the love of god
[52:55] unfolding for his children brother brown
[52:59] would say like this
[53:00] when god was going to take the life of
[53:02] the whole world
[53:03] and destroy it all were sinners
[53:06] condemned to die
[53:08] christ died for us all and god could not
[53:10] cross over christ
[53:12] being his own son and when jesus gave
[53:15] himself freely
[53:16] that he might pay the way and he says
[53:19] now
[53:20] he alludes to this place he said now
[53:22] moses couldn't do that
[53:24] because moses had no blood but human
[53:27] blood
[53:27] like we are his blood would not suffice
[53:30] so you say how did god not cross over
[53:33] moses
[53:34] because moses had the revelation
[53:37] by the spirit abiding in his life
[53:41] he was standing there as a
[53:43] representative of god
[53:45] in that hour it was that revelation
[53:48] that would break the chains of egypt
[53:51] upon the people's life and it would be
[53:54] that same revelation
[53:55] that would put him in the land so it was
[53:58] all a
[53:58] type of the prevailing revelation
[54:02] that would lay in the revealing
[54:05] of jesus christ that there was
[54:08] coming of blood that in that blood cell
[54:12] would be alive and when that revelation
[54:15] would begin to strike a heart it would
[54:17] pack a person
[54:19] from darkness into light it would pass
[54:22] from
[54:22] death unto life it would break the holds
[54:25] of sin and unbelief and the chains and
[54:28] the darkness of the world
[54:29] it would relieve a life of slavery and
[54:33] condemnation
[54:34] and bring them into divine love and
[54:37] service
[54:38] unto almighty god it was a type
[54:42] he said jesus being the blood of god
[54:44] himself the creative blood of god
[54:46] god just excused the entire human race
[54:49] then
[54:50] because it all laid upon him and he went
[54:53] to calvary
[54:54] and died out of the presence of god and
[54:57] suffered and was cast into hell you
[55:00] realize nobody has to go to hell
[55:03] if a person goes to house because they
[55:04] made a choice
[55:07] nobody has to go to hell as a matter of
[55:08] fact brother brown said you'll have to
[55:10] run
[55:11] roadblocks to get there gotta put up a
[55:14] roadblock
[55:15] go right on through it another roadblock
[55:17] go right on through it
[55:20] you see he he was cast into hell because
[55:23] he was sin
[55:24] our sins was upon him there being
[55:27] our burden bearer he took our sins to
[55:31] calvary
[55:32] and from calvary to hell and god raised
[55:35] him up on the third day
[55:36] for a perpetuation for our sins and
[55:39] today
[55:40] he is the only mediator between god
[55:44] and man him alone
[55:47] now who is he he's the word amen is that
[55:50] right
[55:51] he's the living god he is our high
[55:53] priest
[55:54] no other man is a mediator
[55:58] if anybody else is a mediator between
[56:00] you and god you're still in your
[56:02] sins are you with me
[56:05] this is why there's a there's a while
[56:07] the the church that it's religion spread
[56:10] all over the world
[56:11] they've got they've gotten what they
[56:12] thought it's mediators and
[56:14] a man who speaks upon earth and he can
[56:16] forgive sins but you see
[56:18] there's only one that can forgive sins
[56:20] and that's god
[56:21] and if the word isn't there there is no
[56:24] forgiveness of sins
[56:26] forgiveness of sins it's more than just
[56:28] a good feeling we're talking
[56:30] about a work that goes down and deals
[56:32] with the very
[56:33] root of the problem of why the sin
[56:37] is there it's got to be a word that's
[56:41] able
[56:42] to address that a word in authority
[56:44] that's able to back the devil up
[56:46] a word that's able to dismantle his hold
[56:49] of unbelief on that life a word that can
[56:52] say let my son go
[56:54] that he might serve me hallelujah a word
[56:57] that comes with authority
[57:00] glory be to god he's the only mediator
[57:02] between
[57:03] god and man and we're freely pardoned
[57:07] and forgiven god don't even know we ever
[57:09] sin
[57:10] our sins were put in the sea of
[57:12] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[57:14] more
[57:15] listen we cannot do that ourself
[57:19] we are finite he's infinite
[57:22] and our finite we can still remember
[57:25] because
[57:26] we're not big enough you see we're not
[57:29] able to
[57:30] put our sins there so it takes the work
[57:34] of an infinite god
[57:37] and when an infinite god doesn't work
[57:39] inside
[57:40] of a finite one then you have an
[57:43] infinite god
[57:44] that has that has moved to an infinite
[57:47] work
[57:47] in a finite being so then that that life
[57:51] is no longer
[57:52] just a creature of time but now is a
[57:55] creature
[57:56] of eternity or as the scriptures could
[57:58] say a new
[57:59] creation in christ jesus
[58:04] this is a work by the infinite one
[58:07] he is so great that he ever forgets we
[58:10] ever did sin now see
[58:11] even after what god has done such a such
[58:13] a depth of work
[58:14] of the creation of the infinite one in
[58:16] our lives
[58:18] we still have the memories of everything
[58:19] that was done
[58:22] while we were there in sin
[58:25] we have memories but the nature is no
[58:28] longer there
[58:31] the nature's gone the very root of it
[58:34] the very
[58:34] problem in the first place that's why
[58:37] you stand justified
[58:38] in the presence of almighty god that's
[58:41] why in his presence
[58:42] you never ever did sin why god don't
[58:45] take the old man and clean him up
[58:47] he brings him to a place kills him and a
[58:49] new man steps here it's where the seed
[58:52] and the seed of his life unite together
[58:55] and bring forth
[58:56] a new man a new creation as he said
[58:59] behold i make all things
[59:01] anew is that right
[59:05] so when we when we when we see this this
[59:08] is why
[59:09] that that we see in the scripture he
[59:11] says
[59:12] we are sons and daughters in his
[59:14] presence and all things that he was
[59:16] we are he become my sin
[59:20] that i might become his righteousness he
[59:22] become your sin
[59:23] that you might become his righteousness
[59:26] god cannot see
[59:27] sin cannot see no sin in you
[59:30] as long as your confession is in
[59:34] christ jesus notice in christ
[59:37] jesus the anointed word
[59:40] as long as your life the confession is
[59:43] your
[59:44] life not just what's spoken here but
[59:46] what is spoken out of here
[59:48] as long as our confession is in him then
[59:51] god can see no sin in your eyes
[59:56] oh my now brother brown takes this up
[59:58] and he said now
[1:00:00] someone told me he said some time ago
[1:00:02] they said man if i ever believed a thing
[1:00:04] like that i'd really turn on the steam
[1:00:07] i'd paint the town red i'd go to every
[1:00:10] dance call
[1:00:11] i'd get so drunk abraham said why
[1:00:15] you're already secured in christ what
[1:00:18] difference does it make
[1:00:20] you see what it is when this person said
[1:00:23] man if i believe such a thing like that
[1:00:25] you mean i could just go do whatever i
[1:00:27] want to do
[1:00:28] well to a real believer i do what i want
[1:00:30] to do
[1:00:32] i could drink as many beers as i want to
[1:00:34] drink don't stop the internet now
[1:00:37] i don't want to drink that
[1:00:40] the desire has been taken away
[1:00:44] i'm not doing things because it's a law
[1:00:47] he took the desire
[1:00:49] out of my life
[1:00:53] we're not bound by a law or under fear
[1:00:55] this is divine love
[1:00:57] it really sets you free
[1:01:02] that's why when this person said well if
[1:01:03] i really believe that man i'd go paint
[1:01:05] the town red
[1:01:06] they're not where they need to be they
[1:01:08] might be looking at that this of what
[1:01:11] brother brown had said
[1:01:12] but if you ever really get it to where
[1:01:14] it needs to be
[1:01:15] down on the inside it doesn't matter
[1:01:17] they can put all the cigarette joints
[1:01:19] all the stripped off all the women and
[1:01:21] everything else there's a love affair
[1:01:23] on the inside an anchor that holds you
[1:01:26] by the power of the new birth
[1:01:28] [Applause]
[1:01:29] are you with me i'm talking about a
[1:01:31] living god who brings a living reality
[1:01:34] into that life
[1:01:37] oh my he says that shows you haven't got
[1:01:39] it
[1:01:40] if the love of god ever struck your
[1:01:42] heart in the tenderness
[1:01:44] of jesus christ notice in the tenderness
[1:01:47] of jesus christ
[1:01:49] you would be so in love with him the
[1:01:52] world would be
[1:01:53] dead as your sin that's how you know you
[1:01:56] have the holy spirit
[1:01:57] not because you could scream shout speak
[1:02:00] uh speaker tongues or whatever
[1:02:01] but when sin becomes dead and you're
[1:02:04] alive in jesus
[1:02:06] christ oh love of god how rich
[1:02:09] how pure lebron will give an example and
[1:02:13] this one
[1:02:14] he gives it here and gives it over in
[1:02:16] perfect faith as well but
[1:02:17] he talks about a man down in louisville
[1:02:22] and this man had you know really lived
[1:02:25] an awful life but one day
[1:02:29] he met the lord jesus and
[1:02:33] he became as brother branham would
[1:02:34] describe it a real staunch
[1:02:37] christian in other words he's true
[1:02:41] and there was a young lady here in that
[1:02:44] same church and
[1:02:45] you know she had been a real staunch
[1:02:47] christian but she had never
[1:02:48] you know been out in the world before
[1:02:50] she had to have her own experience but
[1:02:52] she had never went out and ran like he
[1:02:55] ran and
[1:02:55] all the scars and everything that he had
[1:02:58] experienced but they fell in love with
[1:03:00] one another
[1:03:01] and they got married and brother branham
[1:03:03] relates this
[1:03:04] in this way he says you know they after
[1:03:06] they had been married about two years
[1:03:08] and things like that
[1:03:10] she she told him she said dear
[1:03:13] she said i suppose it's kind of hard for
[1:03:15] you just a new christian
[1:03:17] she said i've been a christian since i
[1:03:18] was a little girl
[1:03:20] for you a young christian to stand all
[1:03:22] the whiles and
[1:03:23] temptations that goes with it after
[1:03:25] you've sinned so long
[1:03:27] you say well it does become a battle she
[1:03:30] said
[1:03:30] i want you to remember one thing if the
[1:03:33] enemy
[1:03:34] does upset you somewhere and you fall
[1:03:37] and you go back into sin don't stay away
[1:03:39] from home
[1:03:40] i want you to come on home
[1:03:44] you're going to find at home the same
[1:03:46] wife
[1:03:47] that you married i'll help you to pray
[1:03:50] back
[1:03:50] and pray through and get back to god
[1:03:52] again
[1:03:53] i don't want you to stay away
[1:03:56] look i married you upon the basis of not
[1:04:00] what you were but i married you because
[1:04:02] i loved you
[1:04:04] and she said no matter what you do i
[1:04:06] still love you
[1:04:07] i married you because i loved you
[1:04:11] boy if that revelation we could just
[1:04:13] preach on marriage right here
[1:04:14] if that revelation can stick you don't
[1:04:17] marry somebody on the
[1:04:18] pretence and hope of what they can
[1:04:21] become
[1:04:23] you marry them for who they really are
[1:04:26] hey listen when god sought you and i out
[1:04:29] he's looking beyond all the sin
[1:04:31] and the darkness in our life
[1:04:35] he's not making excuse for it but he
[1:04:37] knows down on the inside
[1:04:39] if i can get to that inside man that's
[1:04:42] where
[1:04:42] my my power my love is released to that
[1:04:45] inside man
[1:04:46] the darkness will flee from that life
[1:04:50] it won't have to say don't do this don't
[1:04:53] do that don't do this why
[1:04:54] because the lawgiver himself has moved
[1:04:57] on the inside
[1:05:03] think of this now that watch how brother
[1:05:05] bram goes with this he said now the man
[1:05:08] that day at work he was heard repeating
[1:05:10] it where he was working
[1:05:13] how could a man do anything wrong
[1:05:16] against something like that
[1:05:17] did you hear that how could a man do
[1:05:19] anything wrong against something like
[1:05:21] that
[1:05:22] when somebody loves you that way how
[1:05:24] could you do anything wrong
[1:05:27] hallelujah when a woman loves that man
[1:05:30] so much no matter what he did was
[1:05:31] willing to come back and take him again
[1:05:33] and try it again
[1:05:34] now you multiply that by a
[1:05:38] billion
[1:05:41] or maybe we could say beyond the
[1:05:42] national debt multiply that by a billion
[1:05:46] and then you have some idea
[1:05:49] of what the love of god is
[1:05:56] what had happened is that man in the
[1:05:59] story
[1:06:00] he did not take what she said and
[1:06:03] has a license for him to sin if he would
[1:06:05] have
[1:06:06] he wouldn't have really been really in
[1:06:08] love with her
[1:06:10] or ever received the same love
[1:06:13] that she had projected you see this is
[1:06:16] why the scripture says
[1:06:17] not that we love god for love is of god
[1:06:22] god is love we needed the love of god
[1:06:25] to come to you and i and be projected
[1:06:28] into our lives because in all of our
[1:06:31] efforts
[1:06:32] we could never project back in our own
[1:06:35] earthly love
[1:06:36] filial love the love that was being
[1:06:39] projected to us
[1:06:40] we needed god to come and project
[1:06:44] that love to you and i and there had to
[1:06:46] be a part
[1:06:47] on the inside just like there's a part
[1:06:49] in your cell phone
[1:06:51] there's a chip that's in there and that
[1:06:53] chip has the ability
[1:06:55] to receive a signal that's projected to
[1:06:59] it
[1:06:59] and channel that voice from an unseen
[1:07:02] rail
[1:07:02] there is a seed of god that lays in a
[1:07:06] heart
[1:07:06] that's made there to receive the
[1:07:08] projected
[1:07:09] love of god and project it back not with
[1:07:12] a weakened strength not with a weakened
[1:07:15] signal
[1:07:15] but reflected in the same power
[1:07:18] the same glory that it was sent in
[1:07:27] hallelujah it was a love affair with
[1:07:29] them
[1:07:31] not alone not a duty
[1:07:34] are you with me it wasn't a prenuptial
[1:07:37] agreement
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:40] preach somebody when a man falls in love
[1:07:43] now watch out what's up this parallel
[1:07:45] when a man falls in love with jesus
[1:07:47] christ
[1:07:49] oh the things of the world he said when
[1:07:52] you think of what he
[1:07:53] did for you this is key
[1:07:57] in the light of the scripture
[1:08:01] in the light of the scripture
[1:08:05] not in the light of some emotion but in
[1:08:07] the light of facts
[1:08:08] what it is then there is something
[1:08:11] happens
[1:08:12] in you when the new birth comes
[1:08:15] then sin is as dead as midnight
[1:08:18] when as long as that light is in you how
[1:08:21] can darkness shine
[1:08:22] you say how could darkness shine it's a
[1:08:25] false light
[1:08:27] is that right false light false
[1:08:30] evidences
[1:08:31] darkness shine false light but it must
[1:08:34] be
[1:08:34] true light in john 1 true light
[1:08:38] now shining the bible promised in the
[1:08:41] end time there would be light in the
[1:08:44] evening time
[1:08:46] a time as the bible says in isaiah 16.
[1:08:49] gross darkness
[1:08:50] is upon the face of the earth but thy
[1:08:53] light has come
[1:08:55] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[1:08:58] you
[1:09:00] so this light is his life his person
[1:09:03] notice that's what he says as long as
[1:09:06] the light's in you
[1:09:07] how can darkness shine it can't do it
[1:09:10] that's what god did to one man who
[1:09:14] throwed himself in the gap
[1:09:15] that could take the promise
[1:09:19] she brings it right back down into moses
[1:09:21] life at this time
[1:09:23] the scripture speaks to us in ephesians
[1:09:27] chapter 2 verse 4.
[1:09:30] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:09:35] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:09:42] i want you to think of this god's mercy
[1:09:46] we did not deserve his mercy
[1:09:50] if we got what we deserve we get
[1:09:52] judgment
[1:09:56] but the mercy of god the richness of his
[1:09:59] mercy
[1:10:00] wherein his great love that he loved us
[1:10:04] now to think of this of how that god
[1:10:08] as he he paid the way he paid the price
[1:10:11] he became
[1:10:12] as we read in our scripture this morning
[1:10:14] our propitiation
[1:10:16] or it's the expiator or one who removes
[1:10:20] the sin not just distant forgiveness of
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:23] but who goes down and deals with
[1:10:26] the problem in our life he deals with
[1:10:29] what it is that you and i
[1:10:31] are no longer going to be twain where
[1:10:33] here is
[1:10:34] god and here we are but where now god
[1:10:36] and man
[1:10:37] become reconciled together in a union
[1:10:40] that's god's desire is that he would
[1:10:43] walk in us
[1:10:44] live in us talk through us he would
[1:10:46] project his very
[1:10:48] life through you and i this is the whole
[1:10:50] hold down through the scriptures
[1:10:52] of the union not where we're two
[1:10:54] separate people
[1:10:55] but where that our lives become the very
[1:10:58] reflection of jesus christ upon this
[1:11:01] earth
[1:11:02] and you and i could not make a way
[1:11:05] there's nothing that we
[1:11:07] could do to make this possible but he
[1:11:10] has made it possible he not only made it
[1:11:15] possible
[1:11:16] but god's determination and sending
[1:11:19] and coming to the gentiles which was
[1:11:22] hidden part
[1:11:23] in the word of god god himself would
[1:11:25] send his word
[1:11:27] to you and i but through him by a
[1:11:30] messenger
[1:11:31] in every age as a matter of fact that
[1:11:33] messenger
[1:11:34] would not bring his own light he will he
[1:11:38] is a star
[1:11:39] he is reflecting the light from god
[1:11:43] into that age into the church of the
[1:11:46] living god
[1:11:47] what light is he reflecting revelations
[1:11:50] 1 1
[1:11:50] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:11:53] gave
[1:11:54] unto john you see that revelation of
[1:11:57] jesus christ
[1:11:58] is what is personal between you and god
[1:12:02] a man can't teach it into you a man
[1:12:04] can't school it into you
[1:12:06] your experience is predestinated
[1:12:09] in the hand of almighty god that's why
[1:12:12] when you hear the word
[1:12:13] it has a sound to it that resonates in
[1:12:16] your heart
[1:12:17] it's a sound of freedom it's a sound of
[1:12:20] liberty
[1:12:20] it's a sound you've been longing for why
[1:12:23] there's something on the
[1:12:24] inside to receive that love that's being
[1:12:27] projected
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:31] now listen revelations 1 16
[1:12:35] and he had in his right hand his
[1:12:38] authority and power
[1:12:40] seven stars seven messengers
[1:12:43] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:12:46] two-edged sword
[1:12:47] why is to cut away the unbelief
[1:12:51] are you with me you see the sword goes
[1:12:53] forth to circumcise
[1:12:55] cut away the stoniness cut away the
[1:12:57] world from our lives
[1:13:03] and his countenance that's his person
[1:13:06] his presence his countenance was as the
[1:13:10] sun
[1:13:11] shineth in its strength see in every
[1:13:14] generation i'm saying these things very
[1:13:16] purposely
[1:13:17] in every generation god would take a man
[1:13:23] those seven stars in his right hand
[1:13:26] whom god himself he would reflect god
[1:13:29] would
[1:13:29] in that light of god would be emitted
[1:13:32] and they that light would be shine into
[1:13:35] the church
[1:13:36] what did paul say in first corinthians 4
[1:13:39] he would speak to you and i and say that
[1:13:41] same light that
[1:13:42] shined in the beginning god hath shined
[1:13:46] into our hearts
[1:13:50] he says we preach not ourselves we
[1:13:53] preach
[1:13:53] jesus christ is that right
[1:13:57] we preach him he's the he's the light is
[1:14:00] that right
[1:14:00] so they would project this vision of the
[1:14:03] love of god
[1:14:04] into the church in the light of the
[1:14:07] scripture
[1:14:08] what jesus christ did for us they would
[1:14:11] reveal
[1:14:12] who he is and the benefits that belong
[1:14:15] to us
[1:14:16] as his beneficiaries you know you've got
[1:14:18] benefits
[1:14:19] you've got rights as the son and
[1:14:21] daughter of god and there's got to be
[1:14:23] somebody tell you
[1:14:24] what your rights are if you don't know
[1:14:27] what your rights
[1:14:28] are you'll keep on living beneath your
[1:14:30] privileges
[1:14:31] but when somebody lets you know what
[1:14:33] your rights are let me tell you
[1:14:34] something
[1:14:35] when your rights are made known to you
[1:14:37] you've got a right to rise up
[1:14:40] that's god giving you authority to say i
[1:14:43] receive
[1:14:43] what belongs to me brother it's not a
[1:14:46] second-hand revelation
[1:14:48] it's the very one who wrote your name in
[1:14:51] the word
[1:14:51] where you were in the beginning that
[1:14:53] same god who came down
[1:14:55] and took upon flesh is now ministering
[1:14:59] the inheritance of the covenant
[1:15:03] hallelujah the evidence ain't out in the
[1:15:06] field somewhere
[1:15:07] he packs the evidence with him
[1:15:11] do pack the evidence with you too come
[1:15:14] on now
[1:15:16] i've got to stay out of that it's the
[1:15:19] benefits that belong
[1:15:20] to the beneficiaries of his
[1:15:29] let me say this that surrendered vessel
[1:15:32] one of those stars
[1:15:34] in his right hand they would herald
[1:15:37] the overcoming message in every age he
[1:15:40] that happened here to here
[1:15:42] notice god addresses the revelation
[1:15:45] relative to one person because why
[1:15:48] it's a trumpet what's a trumpet do when
[1:15:51] a trumpet sounds
[1:15:53] it denotes war and that trumpet sounding
[1:15:56] is declaring war on the devil
[1:16:00] where the devil has held god's children
[1:16:03] that trumpet sounds out it lets
[1:16:05] them know there's an atonement there's a
[1:16:07] blood there's a liberty
[1:16:09] that can set you free it has already
[1:16:12] done
[1:16:12] it you must receive it a trumpet sounds
[1:16:16] not with obscurity not with maybe it's a
[1:16:19] certain
[1:16:20] sound that rings out with a life that is
[1:16:24] surrendered
[1:16:24] in the right hand of god power and
[1:16:27] authority
[1:16:28] and glory
[1:16:32] that's why god sends his messengers
[1:16:35] they are from his right hand they are
[1:16:38] one god has not entrusted it
[1:16:39] to the church to emit this light amen
[1:16:44] i'm talking about in the light of the
[1:16:46] scripture
[1:16:48] they herald an overcoming message to
[1:16:51] that age
[1:16:52] and those who are ordained to overcome
[1:16:57] they hear it amen
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:01] they receive it amen are you with me
[1:17:04] and the strength of god comes in their
[1:17:07] life
[1:17:08] to fully manifest overcoming power
[1:17:13] can i preach a little here when that
[1:17:17] overcoming power has come in
[1:17:18] let sickness come there's a power behind
[1:17:21] them
[1:17:22] let the devil say you'll never make it
[1:17:24] there's a power
[1:17:25] behind them there's a power that the
[1:17:28] devil said i'll set this trap
[1:17:30] or i'll set this but there's a power
[1:17:32] behind them that lifts them
[1:17:34] above the hole of the enemy they know in
[1:17:36] their heart something
[1:17:37] something's happened something's changed
[1:17:40] i'm no longer the same
[1:17:41] i'm not bound i'm not subservient to the
[1:17:44] devil i don't have to listen to your
[1:17:46] mind battles
[1:17:46] i don't have to receive of your lies
[1:17:49] i'll stand in that liberty
[1:17:51] when sickness comes when times of
[1:17:53] trouble comes
[1:17:54] there's a power in your life that moves
[1:17:57] you through
[1:17:58] it that navigates you through it when
[1:18:00] you feel like i'll never make it but
[1:18:02] there's one on the inside
[1:18:03] that can declare to you i've already
[1:18:06] made it
[1:18:09] there's a strength that's released in
[1:18:12] that moment
[1:18:14] that's what this message does when it
[1:18:18] comes
[1:18:21] first timothy 2 5 there's one god
[1:18:25] and one mediator between god and man
[1:18:28] the man christ jesus notice the man
[1:18:31] christ
[1:18:32] jesus the anointed word
[1:18:35] there's one man who's a mediator a
[1:18:38] go-between
[1:18:39] god and man and so that same god
[1:18:43] here he stands as the go-between
[1:18:47] that man sinful man and a holy god
[1:18:51] he's a media there's only one mediator
[1:18:54] between god and man and that's the man
[1:18:56] christ jesus who gave himself
[1:18:59] a ransom for all to be testified
[1:19:03] in due time
[1:19:08] the payment's already been made
[1:19:13] but you see without that revelation in
[1:19:15] the light of the scripture
[1:19:17] shining it emits a light
[1:19:20] that doesn't show it being paid for you
[1:19:26] you say what do you mean to where
[1:19:27] everything's always trying to
[1:19:29] well i'm trying to live a better life
[1:19:30] and help me to be a
[1:19:32] let's just let we're going to try to be
[1:19:34] better people and we're gonna try to be
[1:19:36] real good and
[1:19:38] that ain't what christianity is
[1:19:40] psychology produces that stuff
[1:19:43] that ain't what i'm talking about that
[1:19:46] ain't what he went to calvary for
[1:19:48] and rose up on that easter morning
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:51] he didn't pay the price to become a
[1:19:53] psychologist
[1:19:54] he made a way that he might reveal
[1:19:57] himself
[1:19:58] i am your lord i'm your savior i'm the
[1:20:00] redeemer i'm your shepherd
[1:20:02] i'm your deliverer i'm your all in all
[1:20:05] [Applause]
[1:20:07] hallelujah so this is
[1:20:10] not just it's not a historical event
[1:20:14] alone to where we just look back to
[1:20:16] calvary but let me tell you something
[1:20:19] the same dove that led the lamb to
[1:20:21] calvary
[1:20:22] is the same one who has been revealed
[1:20:25] through the seven
[1:20:26] church age messengers that same
[1:20:29] life has been emitted into the church
[1:20:32] of the living god you say what are you
[1:20:34] saying i'm telling you
[1:20:36] that the one who paid the price the one
[1:20:39] who is the only mediator between god and
[1:20:42] man
[1:20:43] and he is the word and when that
[1:20:45] revelation
[1:20:46] of jesus christ in that age comes
[1:20:49] it is the mediator that has come on the
[1:20:52] scene
[1:20:53] in order to ratify the covenant
[1:20:56] with your heart
[1:21:09] so this vessel that god would choose but
[1:21:12] say you're laying an awful lot on that
[1:21:13] vessel
[1:21:14] you take away the seven stars and we
[1:21:16] have nothing but church darkness
[1:21:19] because it's not their light this
[1:21:22] message
[1:21:22] that god sent through his prophet
[1:21:25] brother branham this ain't another
[1:21:27] continuation
[1:21:28] like well that's dwight moody and that's
[1:21:30] all the rest one of them were great men
[1:21:32] but they were not the prophet of god
[1:21:35] god made a promise in his word before
[1:21:38] that great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:21:41] let me tell
[1:21:42] you we're here at the time of judgment
[1:21:44] being a good old boy ain't going to get
[1:21:46] you here
[1:21:47] you've got to be washed in the blood of
[1:21:49] the lamb
[1:21:50] you've got to be set free by the power
[1:21:53] of the holy ghost
[1:21:56] and god sent a word when god said lest i
[1:21:58] come
[1:21:59] and wipe out this earth and smite it
[1:22:01] with the curse
[1:22:02] but in this hour god has stepped on the
[1:22:06] scene
[1:22:07] to reveal himself as the mediator
[1:22:12] he came down with his mind on his
[1:22:15] covenant
[1:22:15] a rainbow was upon his head
[1:22:21] that's what the cloud was out there in
[1:22:24] sabino county
[1:22:25] it was god coming back with the
[1:22:27] authority of his word
[1:22:29] let a devil raise his head that devil's
[1:22:31] already been defeated
[1:22:33] there's the authority of the word the
[1:22:35] mediator is here
[1:22:36] the high priest is here
[1:22:41] let the devil stick his head up it'll
[1:22:43] get cut off
[1:22:47] boo devil
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:23:03] one that was yielded to god
[1:23:06] one that as god will continue to reveal
[1:23:09] himself
[1:23:10] what do you find in his life things that
[1:23:12] he might have just thought
[1:23:14] the brother aaron he couldn't think no
[1:23:15] more than that until god revealed it to
[1:23:17] him
[1:23:18] he's looking at the scripture but he can
[1:23:20] do no more
[1:23:21] until god reveals it to him that is the
[1:23:23] pattern of every prophet you check
[1:23:25] down through the old testament and not
[1:23:27] on a man who can go in
[1:23:29] and will his way and pry this in and out
[1:23:31] that's not a prophet
[1:23:32] a prophet doesn't say he went to the
[1:23:34] word it says the word of the lord comes
[1:23:36] to
[1:23:37] him and god will not do anything
[1:23:40] except he reveal himself to the prophet
[1:23:45] so anything god's doing in this hour it
[1:23:48] will be according to the word
[1:23:50] that he has sent or through his prophet
[1:23:53] of
[1:23:53] malachi 4 amen which is god's promised
[1:23:57] word now
[1:23:57] look at this surrendered vessel this
[1:23:59] surrendered vessel would be one that
[1:24:02] would be able
[1:24:03] to stand in gaps
[1:24:07] breaches remember when you read in the
[1:24:09] book of ezekiel where god
[1:24:10] would speak of israel here was israel
[1:24:13] you would look at them
[1:24:14] and say my goodness what a people what a
[1:24:16] people a promise
[1:24:17] well that's true there is a lot of
[1:24:19] promises that were made to them
[1:24:21] but when god would describe the
[1:24:23] spiritual condition
[1:24:24] he would look upon them when he would
[1:24:26] look upon the walls of jerusalem
[1:24:28] and god would display that as though
[1:24:31] there's no man
[1:24:32] to make up the gaps there's no man to
[1:24:34] fill the breaches
[1:24:36] meaning that which is separation in
[1:24:38] other words
[1:24:39] sin and unbelief had so separated
[1:24:42] the people of god from who god really
[1:24:45] was
[1:24:46] and who that god desired and intended
[1:24:49] for them to be
[1:24:50] you see you can't be who god really
[1:24:52] wants you to be
[1:24:53] without the gap or the breach being
[1:24:56] taken away in your life
[1:24:58] this is why god had to send the message
[1:25:01] in such simplicity
[1:25:03] of his life because there was a breach
[1:25:06] between you and i there was a chasm
[1:25:09] between
[1:25:09] us and god there was a gap that was
[1:25:12] there
[1:25:12] that old nature and god's own life but
[1:25:15] there had to be one
[1:25:17] that could come and reconcile be
[1:25:20] able to deal with that old nature and
[1:25:23] bring about a real birth
[1:25:25] in our life so who fills the gap not me
[1:25:28] not you but he himself who is the
[1:25:31] mediator
[1:25:32] the high priest the holy ghost himself
[1:25:35] comes in on the scene and he fills the
[1:25:38] gap
[1:25:38] he feels the breach and as a matter of
[1:25:40] fact there is no longer a chasm
[1:25:43] between you and god when you've been
[1:25:45] born of the spirit of god
[1:25:46] there is no longer a breach there is no
[1:25:49] longer a gap
[1:25:50] you are a fully manifested son and
[1:25:53] daughter
[1:25:54] of god
[1:25:59] hallelujah so then
[1:26:02] in your life my life that same love
[1:26:06] it moves forward now it reaches to a
[1:26:09] place
[1:26:10] where the love that now has been
[1:26:12] projected
[1:26:13] is now projecting back to him
[1:26:17] in the same strength that it has been
[1:26:20] shown here
[1:26:22] you see this is why the real true
[1:26:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:26] it's not just you living a good clean
[1:26:28] moral life well i don't smoke no more
[1:26:30] and i don't look at women no more and i
[1:26:31] don't go visit sites anymore
[1:26:33] and i don't do this anymore and i'm i'm
[1:26:35] good to my neighbor you know i give him
[1:26:36] every once around a baloney basket and i
[1:26:37] do all this no no this is not good moral
[1:26:39] living
[1:26:40] it will produce good morality but the
[1:26:42] real reality of the baptism of the holy
[1:26:45] ghost
[1:26:45] is where your life is fully in the word
[1:26:50] are you with me where it's lining up
[1:26:52] with the word because you see a lot of
[1:26:54] times there's people who can skip right
[1:26:55] by with a lot of those things
[1:26:56] even maybe everything right on the dot
[1:26:59] let me just tell you something the
[1:27:00] spirit of god does not make a difference
[1:27:02] between malice bitterness and all those
[1:27:04] other things if you still have that sort
[1:27:06] of an atmosphere about you that when
[1:27:09] somebody crosses you
[1:27:10] man they're gonna get it they've stepped
[1:27:12] on you if you still got that about that
[1:27:14] way in your heart
[1:27:15] you need to be born again you need a
[1:27:17] real baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:19] where the love of god listen i'm not
[1:27:21] trying to put false evidences i'm
[1:27:22] telling you in your heart there ought to
[1:27:24] be something that's great i know it gets
[1:27:26] on the flesh
[1:27:26] and not one of us likes to have somebody
[1:27:29] say something wrong about us
[1:27:30] and sometimes it ain't even about that
[1:27:32] sometimes it's the way we perceive
[1:27:33] things
[1:27:34] hello sometimes it's the way we perceive
[1:27:36] things and
[1:27:37] well man they did this or they did that
[1:27:39] our flesh can get
[1:27:40] even when we have been born of the
[1:27:42] spirit of god our flesh can get
[1:27:44] irritated and rough but brother when the
[1:27:46] love of god is ray residing there on the
[1:27:49] inside
[1:27:49] if you go along that route you'll come
[1:27:51] out there in life you'll come out in joy
[1:27:53] you'll watch the spirit of god resolve
[1:27:55] issues but if you go the other way and
[1:27:57] you're a child of god you're going to
[1:27:58] get corrected all right because
[1:28:00] god won't let his children get by with
[1:28:01] one thing at all
[1:28:06] is that right you say what are you
[1:28:08] saying so if your if your reputation in
[1:28:10] the church
[1:28:11] has been a problem has been a problem
[1:28:13] maker and your reputation has been a big
[1:28:15] mouth
[1:28:15] your reputation has been one that causes
[1:28:17] problems rips people down and criticize
[1:28:19] them i'm telling you there's hope for
[1:28:20] you this morning
[1:28:21] by the love of god that you can actually
[1:28:23] be delivered over the same i know the
[1:28:25] message but i'm asking do you know the
[1:28:27] love of god
[1:28:28] have you ever received the divine love
[1:28:30] of god
[1:28:31] brother it operates and it works in your
[1:28:33] life listen
[1:28:34] if it worked that way for you and i
[1:28:36] where moses stood in the gap
[1:28:38] where jesus stood in the gap if we are
[1:28:41] witnesses of him
[1:28:42] after being endued with the power of the
[1:28:45] holy ghost
[1:28:46] it will operate the same way in our life
[1:28:49] let me tell you the power
[1:28:50] of that love is that even though in your
[1:28:52] emotions you can feel
[1:28:54] so grieved and so wounded but there's a
[1:28:57] power on the inside
[1:28:59] that'll say give way
[1:29:04] but salmon why do these things happen
[1:29:05] for god to prove to you what he's
[1:29:07] already done in your life
[1:29:11] i know we never sign up for that but god
[1:29:13] says you know what i'm gonna show
[1:29:15] you're not the same person my love has
[1:29:18] changed you
[1:29:20] now in the light of that fullness we see
[1:29:23] how it
[1:29:23] increases let me just have just a little
[1:29:25] bit more
[1:29:27] it increases the fullness of this light
[1:29:28] because we're talking about in the light
[1:29:30] of the scripture and has that light
[1:29:32] is being emitted and as that light
[1:29:35] is shining forth he comes back with that
[1:29:39] same strength
[1:29:41] because see in the hour that we're
[1:29:42] living here we're living in a time
[1:29:46] where it is promised that all
[1:29:50] of the light that was down through the
[1:29:52] ages
[1:29:53] is coming together amen as well as
[1:29:57] the darkness is congealing as well it's
[1:30:00] a promise
[1:30:01] god said i'll restore not that he was
[1:30:04] going to restore us to that
[1:30:06] ephesian age or the age of ephesus but
[1:30:09] he restores us back
[1:30:11] to that of the bride that was given
[1:30:14] at pentecost where there was no man-made
[1:30:18] leaven among them
[1:30:19] it was the pure reflected light of the
[1:30:23] scripture
[1:30:24] brother they walked in power and
[1:30:25] authority brother joy they tried to shut
[1:30:28] them up
[1:30:28] they did everything they could and these
[1:30:31] people they didn't even get on facebook
[1:30:33] and complain about it
[1:30:34] they didn't get on twitter and run
[1:30:35] everybody down you know what they did
[1:30:38] they did what any holy ghost field
[1:30:40] christian would do they got on their
[1:30:41] knees and said
[1:30:42] lord thou art the almighty god
[1:30:46] [Applause]
[1:30:47] they were so moved by the spirit of god
[1:30:50] that the spirit of god could direct them
[1:30:52] in the word
[1:30:53] to what was happened and it would take
[1:30:55] them right into psalms oh
[1:30:57] how the heathen rage how they imagine a
[1:30:59] vain faith they have rose up against the
[1:31:01] lord
[1:31:02] and his christ they themselves knew
[1:31:05] where they were standing and they knew
[1:31:07] the god that they had met the same god
[1:31:09] that had forgiven their sins
[1:31:11] the same god that had brought the
[1:31:14] pardoning power
[1:31:15] of the holy ghost into their life they
[1:31:18] knew where they were standing brother
[1:31:20] there wasn't condemnation on their life
[1:31:22] they could look at that devil
[1:31:23] and the devil said i'll kill you but
[1:31:26] stephen looked up
[1:31:27] and he said i see him standing
[1:31:31] the devil couldn't close him up
[1:31:34] hallelujah
[1:31:36] it was a power of the love of god
[1:31:44] i wonder how some people that won't come
[1:31:46] to church because they got to wear a
[1:31:47] mask
[1:31:47] how are you going to stand in front of
[1:31:49] them them christians
[1:31:56] hey peter hey how's everything going
[1:32:00] going good
[1:32:03] i'll tell you peter i would have been in
[1:32:05] church in the last days but
[1:32:06] they made us wear a mess really
[1:32:10] i left out of the city and i met him
[1:32:14] and he said i'm going back in the city
[1:32:17] to be crucified again
[1:32:18] and peter caught that vision no no lord
[1:32:21] he knew
[1:32:22] it was me i must give my life
[1:32:25] are you with me you see in this hour
[1:32:28] these are things
[1:32:29] that we're not just these are not just
[1:32:31] things that's flying by there's a lot of
[1:32:32] things i'm not talking about whether

[1:32:35] you don't don't even get me on that one
[1:32:37] you understand what i'm talking about
[1:32:40] i'm talking about things that just the
[1:32:42] least little bit of inconvenience
[1:32:45] really are we going to stand there
[1:32:47] before the hebrew children
[1:32:48] where they walked in the fire and stand
[1:32:52] there and tell him
[1:32:53] i would have come to church i would have
[1:32:55] served god if it was easier
[1:32:57] that'll never make it brother and sister
[1:33:00] let me tell you how close brother banham
[1:33:01] said it
[1:33:02] if the love of god's in your heart
[1:33:05] you can't wait for those church doors to
[1:33:07] open
[1:33:09] it wouldn't matter if i had to preach
[1:33:10] with a hefty bag on
[1:33:12] i'm going to be in the house of god
[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:17] hallelujah his presence is too precious
[1:33:22] for me to allow some devil to get me
[1:33:24] vexed in my spirit
[1:33:30] lord have mercy that was free
[1:33:36] everybody listen hold on let me preach
[1:33:38] let me go
[1:33:40] we want to stand in this hour we want to
[1:33:44] stand with that real reflection of the
[1:33:45] love of god
[1:33:47] that love of god that comes right on on
[1:33:49] the battlefront
[1:33:51] and will stand right there brother aaron
[1:33:54] when they were tested
[1:33:56] the love of god pushed their faith onto
[1:33:58] the battlefront
[1:34:01] when situations arose in their life
[1:34:04] things came up the love of god pushed
[1:34:06] their faith onto the battlefront
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:16] second thessalonians chapter 2
[1:34:23] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:34:26] worked
[1:34:29] only he who now letteth
[1:34:32] will let until he be taken
[1:34:35] out of the way you see
[1:34:38] the mystery of iniquity is that
[1:34:42] working that comes in
[1:34:46] and it presents jesus christ
[1:34:50] but not in the light of the scripture
[1:34:53] it presents it as a doty
[1:34:56] fat grandpa
[1:35:00] that his children can do no wrong
[1:35:03] god just loves you so much he lets you
[1:35:05] he lets you stay in your sin that ain't
[1:35:07] love
[1:35:08] that ain't the love of god
[1:35:11] that sounds like the message of a
[1:35:14] sorcerer
[1:35:16] that's trying to seduce people and let's
[1:35:19] look at this
[1:35:20] you realize what that does it doesn't
[1:35:22] bind people to jesus christ
[1:35:23] it binds them to the church
[1:35:27] that's an evil spirit a false worker and
[1:35:29] a false light
[1:35:31] the real revelation of jesus christ
[1:35:33] don't bind you to a church
[1:35:35] it binds you to jesus christ it binds
[1:35:38] you to the word
[1:35:41] and it's not a binding it's a yoking
[1:35:43] you're losing
[1:35:45] from the hold of the enemy but you know
[1:35:47] what iniquity is
[1:35:48] lawlessness
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:51] you know why we see the lawlessness to
[1:35:53] where it is right now it's because the
[1:35:55] gospel was neglected in the pulpits
[1:36:01] and allowed other demon spirits to get
[1:36:03] in and inspire people
[1:36:07] inspire them based on who they are
[1:36:10] come on i'm going to preach a strength
[1:36:12] it's a demon spirit that will inspire
[1:36:15] anybody
[1:36:15] apart from the revelation of jesus
[1:36:17] christ
[1:36:19] we're called in this hour the scriptures
[1:36:21] are clear that we are called
[1:36:23] to lay down any any link and anything at
[1:36:26] all and be united with jesus christ
[1:36:28] as paul said there is neither jew nor
[1:36:30] gentile
[1:36:31] but christ is all in all
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:37] we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[1:36:39] i'm going to put him on notice we ain't
[1:36:41] ignorant of your lies
[1:36:43] we bound down to your spirit
[1:36:46] we are the children of the living god
[1:36:50] and god said in this hour he'll call out
[1:36:52] a bride
[1:36:53] of many nations kindreds and towns
[1:37:06] boy i feel like preaching
[1:37:09] that's why when the real revelation of
[1:37:11] jesus christ comes you're not ashamed of
[1:37:13] him
[1:37:14] you're not ashamed of who you are
[1:37:20] i'm talking about on all levels now
[1:37:24] because i'm fearfully and wonderfully
[1:37:25] made
[1:37:27] content with such as i am i am dwelling
[1:37:30] in his presence
[1:37:33] only he who now let us we'll let who
[1:37:36] who's letting this go on
[1:37:37] remember jesus came on the scene judas
[1:37:40] was on the scene
[1:37:42] abel was on the scene cain was on the
[1:37:44] scene
[1:37:45] jacob was on the scene esau was on the
[1:37:47] scene i'm talking about twins
[1:37:51] i'm talking about twins
[1:37:54] lookalike but got different nature
[1:37:59] jacob on the inside loved the birthright
[1:38:02] it absolutely was impossible
[1:38:06] according to all these laws for him to
[1:38:08] obtain it
[1:38:10] he wasn't the firstborn but there was
[1:38:13] something on the inside of him are you
[1:38:14] hearing me
[1:38:15] there was something on the inside of him
[1:38:17] that was pressing
[1:38:19] it was pressing the whole time it kept
[1:38:22] moving him the whole time
[1:38:23] that they could tell him you can't have
[1:38:24] the birthright it don't even pertain to
[1:38:26] you
[1:38:27] but there was a there was a desire on
[1:38:29] the inside
[1:38:30] that god had sowed there why my it
[1:38:33] looked like that's so impossible let me
[1:38:35] tell you something
[1:38:35] there could have been many things that
[1:38:37] come your life maybe even at some point
[1:38:39] you wanted to take your life
[1:38:40] but you can't do it because god's got
[1:38:43] his hand on you
[1:38:44] you must be sealed away in the kingdom
[1:38:46] of almighty god
[1:38:47] there wasn't anything to touch you until
[1:38:50] that birthright has come
[1:38:51] and then even in that it can't come
[1:38:53] unless god permits it
[1:38:56] what is it it's god that's drawing on
[1:38:59] that seed
[1:39:00] it was god that was pulling on your life
[1:39:06] the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:39:09] worked
[1:39:11] he who letteth will now let
[1:39:14] holy ghost was poured out in acts 2.
[1:39:19] here came the spirit of antichrist
[1:39:22] against
[1:39:24] christ
[1:39:26] oh he was talking about jesus but don't
[1:39:29] let him come in a meeting
[1:39:31] don't let him come in don't let him deal
[1:39:33] with my life that's antichrist
[1:39:36] antichrist spirit that wants to go uh
[1:39:40] it wants to go in opposition to the word
[1:39:44] is that right so you see the spirit of
[1:39:47] god
[1:39:47] listen friends he comes to break
[1:39:48] hardness you might be sitting here ever
[1:39:51] so hard this morning
[1:39:52] every one of us were there every one of
[1:39:55] us were there
[1:39:57] oh my but he comes
[1:40:00] he knows how to melt away the hardness
[1:40:02] in your life
[1:40:04] he knows how to melt away the
[1:40:05] indifference in your life
[1:40:09] my only he
[1:40:12] who now letteth will let until he be
[1:40:14] taken out of the way
[1:40:16] you see the mystery of iniquities
[1:40:18] working the mystery of god is working as
[1:40:20] well
[1:40:21] the mystery of god is the baptism of the
[1:40:24] holy ghost
[1:40:26] it's god coming into his people those
[1:40:28] mysteries have always been
[1:40:30] at battle and war with one another
[1:40:34] but you see when you read this scripture
[1:40:37] here
[1:40:37] you realize satan can only
[1:40:41] go so far
[1:40:45] god says that's enough just like with
[1:40:48] job when job was being tested god said
[1:40:51] you can touch everything but don't you
[1:40:53] touch his life
[1:40:56] the devil can only go so far
[1:41:00] and anything that's being permitted
[1:41:04] it's because god is permitting it
[1:41:07] but god being permitting it not that
[1:41:09] he's going along with it
[1:41:10] but you see there must there must be an
[1:41:13] allowance of encroachment of darkness
[1:41:15] and what does it do it it causes the
[1:41:18] light to shine even that much more
[1:41:19] brighter
[1:41:21] are you with me
[1:41:25] let me come to this let me come to this
[1:41:26] point and i'm gonna close
[1:41:29] when that wicked one when when shall
[1:41:32] that wicked be revealed
[1:41:34] whom the lord shall consume with the
[1:41:36] spirit of his mouth
[1:41:38] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[1:41:40] his coming you see what he's going to do
[1:41:43] to the enemy what he's going to do to
[1:41:45] satan
[1:41:46] what he's going to do to that that that
[1:41:48] beast and that pope what he's going to
[1:41:49] do
[1:41:50] he did the same thing in your life he
[1:41:53] destroyed it with the spirit of his
[1:41:55] mouth
[1:41:56] the spirit of his word he dismantled the
[1:41:58] hold of the enemy in your life
[1:42:00] amen amen he overthrew him with the
[1:42:03] brightness of his coming
[1:42:04] even him whose coming is after the
[1:42:06] working of satan with all power and lies
[1:42:08] and
[1:42:08] signs and lying wonders and with all
[1:42:10] deceivalness over unrighteousness in
[1:42:13] them to perish
[1:42:14] because they received not
[1:42:18] the love of the truth
[1:42:22] that they might be saying
[1:42:25] now they've had truth as far as the
[1:42:28] bible
[1:42:29] the bible is all truth is that right
[1:42:32] but it takes the love of the truth and
[1:42:35] that love which is of god that
[1:42:37] is who god is in order to project
[1:42:42] the truth in the light of the scripture
[1:42:44] because truth
[1:42:46] truth is not a doctrine you know we can
[1:42:48] hear what somebody said and say man
[1:42:49] that's true but truth
[1:42:52] is the person of jesus christ
[1:42:56] he is the truth the life the way he is
[1:42:59] the spirit of truth that
[1:43:00] leads and guides us into all
[1:43:04] the word so they receive not the love
[1:43:08] of the truth that they might be
[1:43:11] saying talking about the holy ghost
[1:43:17] for this cause god shall send them
[1:43:20] strong delusion that they should believe
[1:43:24] a lie you see you see what the the cost
[1:43:27] of rejecting light is
[1:43:30] life the love of god
[1:43:33] it's to receive strong delusion
[1:43:39] to believe a lie you know the bible says
[1:43:43] there's a way that seemeth
[1:43:44] right unto man but the end
[1:43:48] the end thereof is the way of death
[1:43:52] strong delusion to where they're
[1:43:54] overtaken they believe
[1:43:55] a lie that they might be
[1:43:59] damned who believed not the truth
[1:44:02] but had pleasure in unrighteousness
[1:44:06] did you catch that the light of god the
[1:44:09] love of god
[1:44:11] has been emitted to their life they can
[1:44:14] see
[1:44:16] there's more light
[1:44:19] there's a deeper work of the love of god
[1:44:22] like we were reading in the beginning
[1:44:24] can't get to it but his love is
[1:44:27] perfected in us perfected means
[1:44:31] it comes to its completion in our life
[1:44:35] it starts on our life and things begin
[1:44:37] to flee away from our life
[1:44:39] little by little the love of god is
[1:44:42] we're taking it in brother drake it's
[1:44:43] just
[1:44:43] things are just fleeing from our life it
[1:44:45] ain't like somebody's coming in there
[1:44:46] going
[1:44:48] it's just
[1:44:59] but when the love of the truth is
[1:45:01] emitted that light has come
[1:45:04] because they resorted and they had
[1:45:07] pleasure
[1:45:09] in unrighteousness still want it to be
[1:45:11] accounted as
[1:45:13] well i serve god still want to be
[1:45:16] regarded as a christian but remember
[1:45:18] to be a christian is not to be one in
[1:45:20] name only
[1:45:22] because if it's just name only that's a
[1:45:24] blasphemous name
[1:45:26] a blasphemous name means to be that
[1:45:28] which is empty and vain
[1:45:31] god never intended for our lives to be
[1:45:33] empty and vain
[1:45:34] but that our lives would be filled
[1:45:38] full and reflective of his name can you
[1:45:41] imagine
[1:45:42] that a person would take religion
[1:45:46] would take knowledge maybe of scripture
[1:45:49] would take program
[1:45:52] when god would be offering them his
[1:45:55] divine love
[1:45:57] of grace mercy power
[1:46:00] an overcoming life a real liberty
[1:46:04] a real freedom you see to a person in
[1:46:08] their mind they can look and think
[1:46:09] how can i ever live above this condition
[1:46:12] i've tried to lay this down
[1:46:14] i've tried to stop this but you see
[1:46:17] that's the problem
[1:46:20] you're trying remember samuel
[1:46:23] am i supposed to try exposed to yield
[1:46:28] and to yield means to obey
[1:46:32] is to believe him who speaks to you
[1:46:38] to yield to him and say be it unto me
[1:46:40] lord
[1:46:42] that's my desire you see where he begins
[1:46:44] to come by
[1:46:46] and the pleasure of unrighteousness he
[1:46:49] flees
[1:46:50] it becomes something that's set before
[1:46:52] you say
[1:46:53] i want him more than anything
[1:46:56] tell you the truth it don't stop there
[1:46:58] it's addicting
[1:47:00] glory be to god i love it when he comes
[1:47:05] it's the greatest joy the greatest
[1:47:09] privilege
[1:47:10] you're gonna wake up in the morning
[1:47:12] right there he is
[1:47:14] you walk through the day right there he
[1:47:16] is
[1:47:18] oh it's it's a love affair that takes
[1:47:21] place in our
[1:47:22] life as i heard brother brian pray right
[1:47:24] here in the opening prayer
[1:47:25] oh god that you would come among us if
[1:47:28] there's anything holding us back if
[1:47:29] there's any holds or anything about our
[1:47:31] life
[1:47:32] lord come on the scene that's the real
[1:47:34] desire of a real believer
[1:47:36] listen friends if we would feel that way
[1:47:38] in the natural if i would feel that way
[1:47:40] about my life my wife
[1:47:41] that i want to express that love to her
[1:47:44] in such a way
[1:47:45] and care for her that there is not an
[1:47:48] even ounce of a question whether i love
[1:47:51] her or not
[1:47:52] if i would work to settle that doubt not
[1:47:55] that she has any
[1:47:56] but i don't pull back from it it just
[1:47:58] keeps going of little ways that i can
[1:48:01] show it
[1:48:01] little plate little tokens of
[1:48:03] appreciation maybe just taking her hand
[1:48:06] and letting her know i love you how much
[1:48:08] more the lord jesus
[1:48:09] brother he's not pulled back in this
[1:48:12] hour if you've got called the bible says
[1:48:15] draw nigh unto god
[1:48:19] and he'll draw nine to you
[1:48:22] hallelujah he ain't far away just
[1:48:25] welcome him back
[1:48:27] just welcome him back maybe you've got
[1:48:29] too busy in your life
[1:48:30] welcome him back
[1:48:34] maybe in your life here you come to the
[1:48:36] end maybe you've went
[1:48:37] and maybe you've sown oats and other
[1:48:40] things have taken place in your life and
[1:48:41] you realize just
[1:48:42] how empty it all is you've tried
[1:48:46] to find satisfaction in all sorts of
[1:48:48] pleasures of life
[1:48:49] let me tell you something you'll never
[1:48:51] find what you're looking for in the
[1:48:52] pleasures of life
[1:48:54] you'll never find it in anything of this
[1:48:57] world
[1:48:58] there's only one place where there's a
[1:49:00] satisfying portion
[1:49:01] and that's in jesus christ he's the one
[1:49:04] that's right here
[1:49:05] this morning he's the one that is the
[1:49:07] perfecter
[1:49:08] he's the one the love of the truth he's
[1:49:10] right here
[1:49:11] this morning he's the one that's
[1:49:13] bringing the word to you and i
[1:49:15] he's the one that's the overcomer he's
[1:49:17] the satisfier
[1:49:18] he is your portion
[1:49:22] this is his love to you and i need more
[1:49:25] what could what what what would be the
[1:49:27] greatest thing brother samuel that we
[1:49:29] could do
[1:49:30] is to receive the projection of his love
[1:49:35] is to receive that and say lord be it
[1:49:37] unto me lord jesus according to your
[1:49:39] word
[1:49:41] it'd be the greatest thing if you know
[1:49:43] you don't have that abiding presence in
[1:49:44] your life well maybe you love the lord
[1:49:46] you love him as far as
[1:49:47] you know you love him as your savior but
[1:49:50] you realize that
[1:49:50] there's still the whole of the world in
[1:49:52] your life but
[1:49:54] what must happen his love must be
[1:49:55] perfected in you
[1:49:57] what should i do well remember love is
[1:49:59] not a struggle
[1:50:00] love is not a strain love itself it
[1:50:03] comes from that yielding
[1:50:04] where you're receiving what he's
[1:50:06] projected and allow it to be fully
[1:50:08] projected because we can never
[1:50:10] reflect listen to me now we can never
[1:50:13] reflect the love of god back from our
[1:50:15] mind
[1:50:16] we can never reflect it back from our
[1:50:18] spirit
[1:50:19] the only true way that we can reflect
[1:50:21] the love of god
[1:50:23] is there's got to be that part of the
[1:50:24] word on the inside
[1:50:26] it moves down to that soul that nature
[1:50:29] that's changed it becomes illuminated
[1:50:33] by the presence of god and it projects
[1:50:36] back
[1:50:37] not a weak miserable christian
[1:50:41] it does not if it does not project back
[1:50:44] excuses well
[1:50:45] i would do better if if only you know i
[1:50:47] i'm trying to do better no no
[1:50:49] the sun's shining its strength
[1:50:53] when it moves to that level that depth
[1:50:56] in our life
[1:50:57] then the love of god is perfected
[1:51:00] in us when it shines back
[1:51:04] with the same strength from the source
[1:51:08] that it comes from when it signs back in
[1:51:11] that strength
[1:51:14] then what is seen the glory of god upon
[1:51:17] our life
[1:51:18] the perfection of god the perfection of
[1:51:21] his life
[1:51:23] his light in us
[1:51:28] that's my desire with all my heart
[1:51:31] lord i don't want no darkness about my
[1:51:33] life
[1:51:35] i don't want anything to get in the way
[1:51:37] this is our desire if
[1:51:39] that has not moved into your heart why
[1:51:41] don't you why don't you let him do that
[1:51:42] this morning
[1:51:44] let him just say lord and maybe in your
[1:51:46] heart you look at your life and you
[1:51:47] think my
[1:51:48] i've got you know things in my life
[1:51:50] right now maybe there's things listen to
[1:51:51] me now
[1:51:53] that you still love maybe there's things
[1:51:56] you still love doing
[1:51:57] don't crawl in a corner on me now
[1:52:00] because the one
[1:52:01] who is here right now that can address
[1:52:03] those things
[1:52:05] don't crawl back in the corner like well
[1:52:06] i'm so ashamed i understand in his
[1:52:08] presence you would be ashamed
[1:52:10] adam and eve they hid themselves as well
[1:52:15] but if you can recognize he's the one
[1:52:18] who's walking
[1:52:19] this morning in his garden
[1:52:22] in his bride he's walking
[1:52:26] and if you could even just be this
[1:52:27] honest
[1:52:29] and say lord loosen me
[1:52:32] from the love of the world
[1:52:35] maybe there's something you really you
[1:52:38] maybe it's just the love maybe there's
[1:52:40] something still holding on your life or
[1:52:41] maybe
[1:52:41] it's just look at full-blown in your
[1:52:43] life you say i still love the world but
[1:52:45] i don't want to be here i
[1:52:47] i want to be free then why don't you
[1:52:50] just reach out to him and say lord
[1:52:53] let your love be perfected in me i'm not
[1:52:56] ashamed to admit lord
[1:52:59] in your presence lord i need help change
[1:53:02] lord the direction of my love lord
[1:53:06] let the direction of my love not be to
[1:53:08] the things of the world
[1:53:10] but let it be to you lord jesus soften
[1:53:14] my heart lord
[1:53:15] soften my heart lord god turn my heart
[1:53:20] i challenge you you do that
[1:53:23] you watch the results when you really
[1:53:25] believe it
[1:53:29] but i want to be closer
[1:53:34] maybe you can look and maybe you find
[1:53:36] yourself getting a little bit weak let
[1:53:37] me tell you something there's a
[1:53:38] refilling station
[1:53:40] you can you can get another filling of
[1:53:42] the holy ghost
[1:53:46] maybe it's not even maybe it's not so
[1:53:47] much maybe that of a feeling we would
[1:53:49] say and yet it's connected in the same
[1:53:51] way
[1:53:51] you would say lord i want my lamp shrimp
[1:53:56] i want my lamp trimmed right now because
[1:53:58] i realize after the rapture
[1:54:00] of burning flax will he not quench i
[1:54:03] want to be trimmed right now i want to
[1:54:05] burn lord god
[1:54:06] burn how with that same reflection of
[1:54:09] that love of god being projected in our
[1:54:11] life
[1:54:11] to where others could look at us we may
[1:54:14] never have an
[1:54:14] opportunity to preach to them we may
[1:54:17] never have an opportunity maybe brother
[1:54:19] william
[1:54:20] to sit down and go through the
[1:54:21] scriptures but the love of god
[1:54:23] is so projected through our life it
[1:54:26] creates an
[1:54:26] atmosphere
[1:54:31] it creates an atmosphere brother shane
[1:54:33] their lives they begin to all of a
[1:54:35] sudden here they are
[1:54:36] they're drawing near they don't even
[1:54:38] know what's taking place
[1:54:41] they're drawing they're being drawn
[1:54:43] because what they're seeing
[1:54:44] is something that's genuine
[1:54:54] i may remember that man that went
[1:54:55] hunting with brother branham i'm closing
[1:54:57] i i just
[1:55:00] i'm way off here but i'm on with him
[1:55:03] amen
[1:55:05] remember that deer and brother brown
[1:55:06] hunting was named bert
[1:55:08] brother brown was hunting with and he
[1:55:09] went deer hunting
[1:55:12] burke got out there he took that
[1:55:15] doe bleat and i think he put a fun phone
[1:55:17] call on it and
[1:55:19] words when that call went out brother
[1:55:23] brian
[1:55:24] it was a call of a fun it was meant
[1:55:28] to mimic a fawn in distress
[1:55:33] and that distress call
[1:55:39] would awaken and alert an attribute
[1:55:43] of mother in a deer
[1:55:47] that call would activate
[1:55:50] her to come out of the thicket
[1:55:55] and she would come out of hiding and she
[1:55:57] would stand there
[1:56:00] but rem said she knew we were there
[1:56:05] but she overlooked the danger
[1:56:08] she overlooked the what if i fail
[1:56:12] she overlooked all of the danger and she
[1:56:16] looked
[1:56:17] she was looking for where that sound
[1:56:21] came from it was the sound
[1:56:24] that brought her out of there and that
[1:56:27] real
[1:56:28] gallon attribute of a mother stood there
[1:56:32] and you know the end of the story bert
[1:56:35] himself
[1:56:37] this gun began to shake and he put it
[1:56:40] down
[1:56:41] he said brother branham or billy
[1:56:45] and had enough lead me to that jesus
[1:56:52] because he's seen something that was
[1:56:54] real
[1:56:55] and genuine something that would
[1:56:58] stand in the face of the enemy
[1:57:02] something that knew the enemies here but
[1:57:05] there was a courage
[1:57:07] that would stand there in that hour
[1:57:11] you said lead me to that jesus
[1:57:18] that's your request this morning
[1:57:21] leave me to that jesus he's here
[1:57:26] he's the one oh he hasn't brought a
[1:57:27] distress call your heart's in this your
[1:57:30] soul's in distress
[1:57:32] but it's the comforter that's calling to
[1:57:34] you come unto me all you that are
[1:57:37] heavy laden and i will give you rest to
[1:57:40] your souls
[1:57:42] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:57:47] it calls us out to be a real gallon
[1:57:50] soldier a real christian oh friends i'll
[1:57:53] say this morning if all this been is a
[1:57:55] knowledge of this message
[1:57:58] you need to go deeper if all it's been
[1:58:01] is well i know brother brown's a pro
[1:58:02] you need to go deeper thank god for that
[1:58:05] but if you believe him to be a prophet
[1:58:06] then

[1:58:08] pointed us to
[1:58:10] stand upon that word and receive that
[1:58:13] token receive that life

[1:58:30] where it's better morally but where the
[1:58:33] very desires of the world have flown
[1:58:35] have gone away and where christ is alive
[1:58:40] i don't say that to scold you but at the
[1:58:42] same time
[1:58:43] we're speaking and we're addressing a
[1:58:45] hole that if the enemy has a hold he's
[1:58:47] got to let go
