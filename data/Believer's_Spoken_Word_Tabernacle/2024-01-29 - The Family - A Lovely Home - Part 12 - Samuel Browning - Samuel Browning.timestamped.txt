[37:53] say to us this morning Father
[37:57] what a privilege it is Lord that you
[38:01] have given to us Lord in this hour Lord

[38:07] would say let us have Grace that we
[38:10] might serve him acceptably Lord you have
[38:14] truly given us Grace in this hour Lord
[38:17] you have shown us your way Lord you have

[40:41] God
[40:45] Amen welcome
[40:55] buddy
[41:07] amen if we could let's turn to Psalms
[41:09] 128 and just have a few verses of
[41:12] scripture here that we're going to read
[41:25] and
[41:29] amen Psalms 128 and verse
[41:34] 1 it says a song of
[41:37] degrees now these are Psalms when it
[41:40] these words when it says just song of
[41:42] degrees it's not just words that are
[41:44] just thrown in there these this is one
[41:47] of the Psalms that when Israel would
[41:50] come together to worship there were
[41:52] three times a year three different
[41:55] festivals that they were to come
[41:57] together Passover Pentecost and Feast of
[42:00] Tabernacles and the Bible says that they
[42:02] would come and present themselves before
[42:05] the Lord and so as they were journeying
[42:09] to Jerusalem and we know that even in
[42:12] Jerusalem it's higher Heights remember
[42:15] remember how brother Brandon would
[42:16] always joke around with that he'd kind
[42:18] of tease a little bit and he would talk
[42:20] about the different brothers that were
[42:22] in outside of Tucson and he says now
[42:24] down in Jericho
[42:27] you remember as he says that he said but
[42:30] up at Jerusalem Jerusalem was higher is
[42:32] a city that was that was higher and that
[42:35] was that was even speaking of the the
[42:37] heights of really that that New
[42:39] Jerusalem amen the the spirit of the
[42:41] Living God brings you and I into in
[42:44] Heavenly places but I'm grateful aren't
[42:46] you grateful in our journey with the
[42:48] Lord that our journey is not going down
[42:49] we're going up we're going up up up up
[42:52] in the preview of the Bride we're not
[42:53] going down we're going up up up up up
[42:56] doesn't matter the test or the trial
[42:58] that comes it doesn't even matter the
[42:59] hiccup in the journey we're going up
[43:01] that's right amen if if you stumble get
[43:03] up and keep let's go up let's go up amen
[43:07] so my we let's read verse one
[43:10] then blessed is everyone that feareth
[43:14] the Lord that walketh in his ways for
[43:19] Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands
[43:23] and happy shalt thou be and shall be
[43:26] well with thee thy wife shall be as a
[43:30] fruitful Vine by the sides of thine
[43:33] house and thy children like Olive plants
[43:37] round about thy table verse four behold
[43:43] that thus shall the man be blessed that
[43:46] feareth the Lord the Lord shall bless
[43:50] thee out of Zion and thou shalt see the
[43:53] good of Jerusalem all the days of thy
[43:56] life yay Thou shalt see thy children's
[44:00] children and peace upon Israel amen may
[44:05] God bless you bless the reading of the
[44:07] word as you're being
[44:09] seated I just like to continue I thought
[44:13] maybe just to get a little shot in the
[44:15] arm here we it's been um many years as
[44:18] as I used to do and I know uh family
[44:22] services and uh we spoke on the family
[44:24] last week and just filling a burden uh
[44:27] on my heart and I've been praying for
[44:29] quite some time and um I just wanted to
[44:32] kind of uh just felt to go ahead and and
[44:34] take another service here because by
[44:36] God's help I would like to do uh this
[44:39] monthly that's what really the burden is
[44:41] upon my heart uh because I I believe
[44:43] it's such a need um God himself if
[44:46] you'll notice that the lord always makes
[44:49] things very simple for us uh we're
[44:52] living in a time that where when you
[44:55] think of the the message the token uh we
[44:58] realize that the token itself is the
[45:00] Holy Ghost it's God's own life being
[45:05] living in and living out through yielded
[45:08] vessels that speak of redemption and
[45:11] then through all of that remember it's
[45:14] to apply the token to apply that that
[45:17] life that the living reality of Jesus
[45:20] Christ to our lives and then to every
[45:23] situation and everything that we come
[45:25] into we want to invite the Lord Jesus
[45:28] into it you'll never ever go wrong in
[45:31] your life we could never go wrong when
[45:33] we invite the Lord Jesus into our lives
[45:37] and into every situation every decision
[45:40] you'll never be wrong as long as you
[45:41] invite him in that's right I and I
[45:44] believe that it's something that's more
[45:45] than just a symbol I believe it to be a
[45:48] reality when this nation first started
[45:50] they left a chair open at the table and
[45:53] that chair was designated they said said
[45:56] for the Lord Jesus it was to it was to
[45:59] note that what we are doing is under the
[46:02] influence of the holy spirit because
[46:05] remember when we look at at everything I
[46:08] believe that that's where God brings us
[46:10] to is this word in itself we we hear the
[46:13] word uh the message preached uh of a
[46:16] thinking man's filter in this hour and I
[46:19] believe that with all my heart that the
[46:21] word itself is to be the filter in
[46:24] everything that we do we say and we pass
[46:27] everything through it if it won't make
[46:29] it through the word well we don't want
[46:31] it anyhow we just we just want the Lord
[46:34] Jesus we we want him we just want more
[46:36] of him I don't want to have just a
[46:38] little bit I want more of him that
[46:40] that's the only thing that satisfies
[46:42] that in my life amen once you get a
[46:46] taste of the Lord the Bible said taste
[46:48] Taste of the Lord and see that he is
[46:50] good and once you taste of him well you
[46:52] really get a good dose of him you just
[46:55] become compl completely addicted to
[46:57] Jesus you you just become a fiend you
[46:59] can't get enough of
[47:01] him amen it's all about him so we you
[47:05] know that is scripture the Bible says
[47:07] that the bereans the Bible says they
[47:09] addicted themselves to the word of God
[47:12] is that what it says in the book of Acts
[47:14] so I want to just speak here just a few
[47:17] moments on on a lovely home and um we
[47:21] were looking at last week on a Godly
[47:23] order and I want to just bring a few
[47:25] more things here uh this this morning
[47:28] and begin even in the message of of
[47:30] influence and I I want to just kind of
[47:33] preface it don't put that up there yet I
[47:35] want to kind of preface it in this way
[47:37] of that um you know when we're looking
[47:40] at the reality is that the word itself
[47:43] and I maybe I want to give this to you
[47:45] up front and let this be in the
[47:47] centermost part of your mind of the of
[47:50] really the the thought that's really
[47:52] bearing upon my heart is that the word
[47:55] itself that God meant his word to come
[47:59] into flesh and be expressed through
[48:02] flesh remember brother Bram takes it in
[48:05] souls in prison now and he says since
[48:08] Calvary he says he has made us partners
[48:12] with him in Redemption we are co-workers
[48:16] with him this is why let this mind be in
[48:19] you which is in Christ Jesus uh brother
[48:22] Bram says in one place you know in the
[48:24] message divine love in Jeffersonville he
[48:27] says you say brother brandham I pray for
[48:30] The Sinner and brother Bram says well uh
[48:32] you know it's got to be more than that
[48:34] he says do you love them enough to make
[48:37] contact with them do you love them
[48:39] enough to make contact with them and he
[48:42] says it like this do you love them
[48:44] enough to win them to Christ uh that's
[48:49] what divine love is it it goes beyond
[48:52] just praying for him but to win them and
[48:55] I look at there are so many examples
[48:57] that what I I'm trying to get to is that
[49:00] the word itself what God does what he
[49:03] has sent here in the message of the hour
[49:06] that message is no longer just it's not
[49:09] just on books it's not just on tapes
[49:12] that message is living in the hearts of
[49:15] God's people and with that message
[49:18] living in the hearts of God's people we
[49:20] now become responsible that that word
[49:24] that that message that that life would
[49:26] move forward that's so good are so are
[49:29] you hearing me oh yeah so we we don't we
[49:32] we we know there's a responsibility that
[49:35] when we have come in contact with the
[49:37] word of God and I I want to read this
[49:39] this here out of the out of the message
[49:42] influence um brother Brandon says now he
[49:45] says a home he said if we made a home
[49:48] more lovely children wouldn't want to
[49:52] run away make things more for them
[49:56] where they feel welcome and nice and
[49:59] comfortable at home now nowhere if
[50:03] you're reading into this scripture
[50:05] compromise or this quote compromise
[50:08] you're reading it wrong he's not saying
[50:11] bring sin in the home because they're
[50:13] they're unconverted no that's that's not
[50:15] it at all but it's it's there with the
[50:18] love of God in your soul when you when
[50:23] the love of God is burned a passion you
[50:26] know when somebody is passionate about
[50:28] something it is
[50:31] effectual now don't don't confuse
[50:34] passion with fanaticism right not the
[50:37] same thing at
[50:39] all passion is a living reality that
[50:43] where where life they are are so taken
[50:47] and there is there is a an atmosphere
[50:50] that's created it with the love of God
[50:52] is in our heart it it cannot help but to
[50:55] create the atmosphere of life itself is
[51:00] that
[51:01] right I pray God will help me to make
[51:04] this clear of what he's put on my heart
[51:06] brother BR says make things more for
[51:08] them where they feel welcome and nice
[51:10] and comfortable at home where home they
[51:14] can't hardly wait till they get there
[51:17] and that's the way home should be that's
[51:22] good now I want to just say just to
[51:24] start off that the presence of the Lord
[51:27] is what makes the
[51:29] home you you always want your home and
[51:32] your life to be a place that the holy
[51:34] spirit is always welcome amen he's
[51:36] welcome to come at any time which he he
[51:40] want him to be dwelling there but he's
[51:41] welcome in every room in every area and
[51:45] every part in every life he's welcome
[51:48] he's first place and I would say it just
[51:51] in this way right here that as we look
[51:54] at it and thinking about well the
[51:56] presence of the Lord because uh to
[51:58] understand maybe a little bit more where
[52:00] I'm going with this it we you want
[52:02] brother bam brings us down in choosing
[52:04] of a bride and if you catch what he's
[52:06] talking about in that in that time he
[52:08] not only talks about the choosing of a
[52:11] mate but then he also parallels that
[52:13] with choosing a church now we realize
[52:16] that that's all well that's our choice
[52:18] that's right but then brother bam tells
[52:21] us in the message the breach once you've
[52:23] been redeemed you no longer want your
[52:25] own choice so what is he meaning by that
[52:28] is he saying that we don't choose no
[52:30] what it is is Lord I want your choice
[52:34] and when I see your choice that's my
[52:35] choice yes sir that's what I choose so
[52:39] it's it's siding with that and you say
[52:41] is that scriptural well yes because when
[52:43] David was leading the children of Israel
[52:45] before he was ever King he was actually
[52:47] anointed king but it had not come into
[52:50] the place cuz Saul hadn't passed off the
[52:51] scene but when but when David came to
[52:54] that place to where at Hebron those of
[52:57] Israel gathered around David after Saul
[52:59] had passed and said thou was he who led
[53:02] us in and out to battle notice they
[53:05] recognize you are God's anointed all
[53:09] along we've recognized it throughout
[53:12] right and so what were they saying when
[53:14] they were saying we're voting on what
[53:17] God has
[53:18] Vindicated that's that that that's the
[53:21] voting that's the choice I I want to
[53:23] choose what God chooses because he's
[53:26] been my choice I I don't want anything
[53:28] else but him because I know if I choose
[53:30] him and what where God is vindicating
[53:32] and what God says and what God declares
[53:35] for my life when I've got a decision
[53:36] before my home before my life I want to
[53:39] know what does God say about it
[53:42] amen that's what I want to know because
[53:45] whatever he says about it I want his
[53:47] choice because in his choice is life in
[53:50] his choice is where he himself will
[53:53] sustain me and Preserve me he'll keep me
[53:56] he'll bless me he'll guide me he'll Lead
[53:59] Me amen that's what I want so the
[54:03] presence of the Lord is very important
[54:05] and so when we look at that we recognize
[54:09] that the presence of the Lord let me
[54:10] come back to my point that the presence
[54:12] of the Lord is very important the
[54:14] prophet says that you're you the church
[54:17] that you choose to fellowship with and
[54:20] that fellowship with is that it is the
[54:22] presence of the Living God who is there
[54:25] there the word of God is preached in its
[54:28] power and its Authority and Jesus Christ
[54:31] is still alive and
[54:34] well that's the church that's what he
[54:36] says that's what you choose many other
[54:40] things we could say but let me just say
[54:42] this that is wonderful and that is
[54:44] glorious and that is something that we
[54:47] take very seriously but our
[54:50] responsibility does not just stop there
[54:53] with coming to a place where where the
[54:55] presence of God is at where the
[54:57] atmosphere is at it now becomes That
[55:00] Glory coming down in us and now we take
[55:03] that home and we minister to our
[55:05] families so in other words it's not just
[55:08] bring the family to church my what a
[55:10] dynamic service May the presence of the
[55:12] Lord that's only part of
[55:14] it that's only a part of it that's very
[55:17] important it's very important but it's
[55:19] only a part of it so here let's go back
[55:22] to our text in Psalms 128 ver1
[55:25] blessed is everyone that feareth I want
[55:29] you to notice these two words feareth
[55:31] the Lord that walketh in his ways now
[55:33] that word to fear it means to Revere or
[55:37] reverence not not something to where oh
[55:39] I'm walking I I I'm afraid I I don't I
[55:42] think I think you know God would be I
[55:44] don't want you know I don't want God to
[55:45] be mad I don't want to go to hell that's
[55:47] that's a slavish fear that fear has
[55:50] torment but we're talking about a
[55:54] reverence you say what does reverence
[55:56] look like where you honor his word above
[55:59] your own
[56:01] ideas where you honor his word above
[56:04] your own thoughts where you deny your
[56:07] own reasoning if your reasoning is not
[56:10] with the word deny
[56:12] [Applause]
[56:16] it
[56:18] Hallelujah that fearth is to reverence
[56:21] the Lord how do we reverence him we
[56:23] reverence his word right right we're not
[56:26] just people walking around that in our
[56:28] mind we walk in the imagination of our
[56:31] hearts that well I you know I I just I'm
[56:33] fearing the Lord no there's a way to
[56:35] know that is that is my life lining up
[56:38] with his
[56:40] word right I I I want to make sure I
[56:43] haven't created my own Bible
[56:45] version you know the anatot an I don't
[56:48] know if I'm saying it right however you
[56:51] say that word annotated version you know
[56:54] it and you put your own name there you
[56:56] know I don't want the king SV I don't
[56:58] want the King Samuel version N I don't
[57:01] want that I want King
[57:05] Jesus blessed is everyone that fearth
[57:08] the Lord and that walketh in his ways
[57:11] and that word walk look at this word
[57:13] very very simple word but notice to
[57:15] reverence notice how it comes over into
[57:18] walking which is to go to walk to come
[57:21] to proceed depart move and the man of
[57:25] life and you say well which one is it
[57:27] it's all of it because I don't want to
[57:29] go where he's not at and where he leaves
[57:33] I
[57:35] leave that's the manner of life he he's
[57:39] revealing himself to you and I it's very
[57:42] incredible when you uh look in the
[57:44] message and if you just type the search
[57:46] in that we might know that I that we
[57:49] might know and you find that it's it
[57:51] begins to be stated almost every single
[57:54] C service once the seals have been
[57:56] opened and it is it is an opening part
[57:59] of the prayer Lord may you come and
[58:02] Reveal Your word that we might know how
[58:05] to live and conduct ourselves as Sons
[58:08] and Daughters of God in this
[58:10] hour we no we're not being instructed by
[58:13] by by by the thoughts of a man we are
[58:16] being instructed by our heavenly
[58:20] father when you read of the tutorship in
[58:23] the scripture the holy spirit is not the
[58:25] third person of the godhead the holy
[58:27] spirit is God himself that came down
[58:31] paid the price in the body of the Flesh
[58:34] and came to you and
[58:37] I watch this with fear Psalms 111 verse
[58:41] 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning
[58:45] of wisdom that's that's the that's the
[58:46] starting point is the fear of the Lord
[58:50] and good understanding have all they
[58:52] that do his Commandments his praise
[58:55] endureth forever Proverbs 1:7 if I go
[58:59] too quick for you and you want want
[59:00] these I'll send them to you the fear of
[59:02] the Lord is the beginning of knowledge
[59:06] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[59:09] I'm not a
[59:11] fool that's so
[59:13] good verse verse 10 of Proverbs 9 the
[59:16] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[59:20] wisdom now you know all of those parts
[59:23] when you read that scripture real true
[59:25] wisdom is what comes from above it's
[59:28] pure full of mercy so what is the real
[59:30] wisdom of God it's the Holy Spirit right
[59:34] right because remember that when you
[59:35] have the parable of the foolish and wise
[59:38] virgin the wise had what oil in their
[59:41] lamp they were filled with the wisdom of
[59:45] God for the hour they were living in so
[59:48] to have to the beginning the the fear is
[59:51] the beginning of of wisdom the fear of
[59:54] the Lord Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[59:55] so we start first of all has God even
[59:58] deals with our lives God deals with our
[1:00:00] hearts it starts first of all with being
[1:00:03] reverent to his word you realize that
[1:00:05] doesn't start after a person gets the
[1:00:07] holy ghost that begins before they ever
[1:00:10] get the Holy Ghost right many times we
[1:00:13] put too many things on well when they
[1:00:15] get the Holy Ghost the everything will
[1:00:17] just you know just straighten up and and
[1:00:18] it's true the Holy Spirit comes in but
[1:00:20] remember he equips you to begin to
[1:00:23] handle things your life but what he does
[1:00:26] as the spirit of God begins to move
[1:00:29] across the life it is what it is
[1:00:31] bringing us to a place of reverencing
[1:00:33] the word that's what leads to repentance
[1:00:36] that's what leads to sanctification and
[1:00:39] ultimately for the same Grace The Same
[1:00:41] Spirit more of it coming in that of the
[1:00:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost so notice and
[1:00:47] the knowledge of the Holy is
[1:00:50] understanding now this knowledge this
[1:00:52] word knowledge it means discernment or
[1:00:54] perception now I know in the hour we're
[1:00:56] living in as I said I think last week
[1:00:58] it'd be very you know we could simply
[1:01:00] compare ourselves to lady oia and to
[1:01:03] others out there and say I'm a pretty
[1:01:05] good guy I mean you know I don't have
[1:01:07] purple hair or pink hair or green hair
[1:01:10] or you know a nose ring or I don't have
[1:01:11] this or I don't have that and you can
[1:01:13] feel pretty good but that's not
[1:01:14] discernment discernment is not just
[1:01:16] what's right and wrong discernment is
[1:01:19] what's right and almost right right amen
[1:01:22] that's what discernment is the
[1:01:24] difference between what's right and
[1:01:26] almost
[1:01:28] right notice in verse two well this is
[1:01:31] verse 2 and three of our text these are
[1:01:33] results of the man now have you noticed
[1:01:36] it never said blessed is the woman Yet
[1:01:38] the woman is blessed is that right a
[1:01:41] woman I realize sometimes in singlehood
[1:01:43] and everything else it all applies to
[1:01:44] our life but when you think of it even
[1:01:46] as family that how that it would be a
[1:01:49] blessing and here's the result of it
[1:01:51] from a man who fears the Lord and walks
[1:01:53] in his way
[1:01:54] Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands
[1:01:59] why because he's going to be working in
[1:02:02] continuity with the will of
[1:02:04] God how can you how can you go wrong
[1:02:07] when you're working outside of God's
[1:02:10] will you can't but when you're working
[1:02:13] in harmony with God's will this is the
[1:02:16] result of it God said you don't have to
[1:02:18] worry about the natural I will take care
[1:02:21] of that as you're lined up with my will
[1:02:24] right right now that don't mean that
[1:02:26] you're going to be able to set at home
[1:02:27] and draw stimulus checks you know
[1:02:29] spiritual stimulus checks I'll just set
[1:02:31] at home you know and drink sweet tea and
[1:02:32] we'll just wait for the checks to come
[1:02:34] in and you know automatic deposit let me
[1:02:36] see if something deposited in my account
[1:02:38] no we're going to have to work we'll
[1:02:40] have to labor but our works and our
[1:02:42] labor is not in a way to try to obtain
[1:02:45] God's favor it is a direct result
[1:02:48] because we have received and been shown
[1:02:52] favor from God that's right is that
[1:02:54] right so now for Thou shalt eat the
[1:02:57] labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be
[1:03:00] and it shall be well with
[1:03:04] thee you realize in that verse right
[1:03:07] there oh my I got to go on verse three
[1:03:09] thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by
[1:03:13] the sides of thine house and thy
[1:03:16] children like Olive plants round about
[1:03:20] thy table this this is the result of the
[1:03:23] Simplicity of fearing the Lord and
[1:03:25] walking in his ways so lovely when we
[1:03:29] look at that that quote that we were
[1:03:31] referring to lovely itself is Godly
[1:03:34] that's what real lovely home it's a
[1:03:36] Godly home that's what lovely Thou Art
[1:03:39] altogether lovely his life and this is
[1:03:42] the reality is is that think about it in
[1:03:45] the reality if someone were to see you
[1:03:47] or see me would they themselves be able
[1:03:51] to see a life filled with joy that's
[1:03:55] good Oh Brother Sam but you don't know
[1:03:57] because no amen remember verse one said
[1:03:59] blessed is he that fearth the Lord and
[1:04:03] walketh in his ways that's the
[1:04:05] prescription for real
[1:04:07] Joy not somebody done somebody wrong
[1:04:10] song somebody somebody no no listen this
[1:04:13] is you understand what I'm saying here
[1:04:14] this morning is that you yourself have a
[1:04:17] liberty that you can live with real joy
[1:04:20] in your life where you're not under the
[1:04:23] control of the thoughts of this or this
[1:04:25] disappointment or what's going on at
[1:04:27] work but there is a place and a source
[1:04:30] of real joy and that place is in Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ and if you have been birthed by
[1:04:36] the spirit of God you've got the joy of
[1:04:39] the Lord in your soul you might go
[1:04:42] through times of discouragement you
[1:04:44] might go through times when things don't
[1:04:46] go your way but you've got a joy that
[1:04:49] the world didn't give and the world
[1:04:51] can't take it
[1:04:52] away this is not not a joy that's
[1:04:55] man-made this is a joy that's been
[1:04:58] deposited by God's own life living
[1:05:01] inside of you that's real
[1:05:07] Joy it's a strength and a confidence in
[1:05:09] what we believe in notice brother B goes
[1:05:13] on in here in the message influence and
[1:05:15] he says I think today we have such a
[1:05:18] juvenile crime wave Across the Nation
[1:05:20] but really he says I think it started in
[1:05:23] the home
[1:05:25] I think the parents begin to let go and
[1:05:29] if the children have been raised up in a
[1:05:31] good old-fashioned Godly home I don't
[1:05:35] watch this I don't say it would be all
[1:05:36] over certainly not but it would
[1:05:39] certainly give that child the right kind
[1:05:42] of
[1:05:43] influence brother Samuel I don't let my
[1:05:46] C I don't let my children just go
[1:05:49] everywhere
[1:05:50] really how far and where do they go on
[1:05:53] their SM
[1:05:55] smartphone see this scripture this this
[1:05:58] quote that I'm preaching right here many
[1:06:00] of these quotes right here see we can
[1:06:01] just set right here within that and man
[1:06:04] I that that don't hit me that don't hit
[1:06:05] me listen friends we're not here to pick
[1:06:07] out and pick AA pick apart faults we're
[1:06:09] here to grow in the grace of God we want
[1:06:12] the spirit of God to call out Satan's
[1:06:15] attempted destruction of God's people so
[1:06:20] to put it in perspective let go is not
[1:06:23] sharah
[1:06:24] if they're predestinated it's just let
[1:06:27] let the chips fall where they may
[1:06:30] no that's not godly at
[1:06:33] all God never I'm quoting now in many
[1:06:37] places in the message your salvation the
[1:06:39] prophet said was not a halfhazard affair
[1:06:43] amen God never treated it like that even
[1:06:45] in dealing with you you realize that's
[1:06:47] where Calvin got off Calvin got to a
[1:06:50] place you remember this in the seals
[1:06:51] brother Bram tells us that Calvin got
[1:06:53] off because he went too far on eternal
[1:06:55] security which a truth but he went too
[1:06:57] far on it where they stopped having
[1:07:00] revivals they stopped repr preaching the
[1:07:02] cross they stopped getting out and
[1:07:04] drawing the people in to where preaching
[1:07:07] by the word the Bible the word of God is
[1:07:09] meant to go forth it's meant to be
[1:07:11] sounded out but instead with Calvin and
[1:07:13] them they took it to such an extreme
[1:07:15] well who's ever going to be there is
[1:07:17] going to be there wrong absolute
[1:07:21] error is that right there's a truth but
[1:07:24] that truth would clear out on a limb now
[1:07:27] notice what brother B goes on to say to
[1:07:29] me when I'm reading these quotes I'm
[1:07:31] reading them in my own for my own life
[1:07:33] and the responsibility amen I think many
[1:07:36] times that homes that children has been
[1:07:38] brought up wrong turned loose on the
[1:07:42] street and just lived for themselves
[1:07:44] while the mother stays in a barroom and
[1:07:47] the father and so forth they don't take
[1:07:49] care of this children now you could read
[1:07:51] this in a different way maybe you say
[1:07:52] brother Samuel I don't go to a barroom
[1:07:55] but if you have your own little cubby
[1:07:57] hole and your place that I'm just going
[1:07:59] off and I'll let the rest of the family
[1:08:01] do whatever you're going off to yourself
[1:08:04] and God never meant you meant for you to
[1:08:07] have a family and then to go on
[1:08:10] autopilot is that right is he not a
[1:08:13] friend that does what sticketh closer
[1:08:16] than a
[1:08:17] brother and if if you say am man it
[1:08:19] helps the medicine it really helps it go
[1:08:21] down really helps it go down is that
[1:08:24] right well brother Samuel do you know
[1:08:26] they're they're
[1:08:28] kids you're the
[1:08:30] adult right think about what God did for
[1:08:33] you and I God never said well I'm God
[1:08:35] they need to come up where I'm at no he
[1:08:37] came down where we
[1:08:39] were and he came down to such a place
[1:08:42] the prophet tells the story of the king
[1:08:45] who came down among his subjects that he
[1:08:49] might understand us
[1:08:52] better is right oh I'm glad for that
[1:08:55] aren't you I'm glad that when I when I
[1:08:57] go to him when he se's right there he
[1:08:59] don't say whoa wow what are you talking
[1:09:01] about Samuel my no he knows because he
[1:09:04] has had a sensible experience that's
[1:09:07] what the word tempted means he's been
[1:09:09] through it aren't you glad for
[1:09:11] that Hallelujah now notice many times
[1:09:15] brother B when he has just read this
[1:09:17] part let's go to the third quote there
[1:09:19] he says another thing they don't love it
[1:09:21] and give it the affections to take it up
[1:09:25] it's young you've got to teach it to
[1:09:29] love and respect and to read the Bible
[1:09:33] read the yes sir Lord have mercy isn't
[1:09:36] there just an update through
[1:09:39] apple.com may maybe it's message the
[1:09:42] message.com I'll get an update for there
[1:09:44] I'll just take my my children I'll take
[1:09:47] my three boys and I'll just plug them in
[1:09:49] right there and all of a sudden it'll be
[1:09:50] the color will turn and sink sink sink
[1:09:53] sink sink see it don't work that way
[1:09:55] does it we are that source of connection
[1:09:59] am as parents in the life we are that
[1:10:02] Source we are that channel you say the
[1:10:04] holy spirit is he operates through the
[1:10:07] agency of man that's right is that right
[1:10:11] he operates through the agency of man
[1:10:13] now they might be ever so little they
[1:10:14] might be this size and this is where
[1:10:16] that we have to pray and say Lord teach
[1:10:19] me and show me with the word that's
[1:10:21] coming forth right now how do I approach
[1:10:23] this situation by the word amen what do
[1:10:27] I say and when do I say it right now
[1:10:31] sometimes listen friends we need we need
[1:10:33] the Lord's help we need his teaching we
[1:10:35] all come from all different types of
[1:10:37] backgrounds we come from all sorts of
[1:10:39] different ways but we want to know his
[1:10:42] ways Lord I want to know how that you
[1:10:45] approach these things Lord how should I
[1:10:47] approach this with my family notice
[1:10:51] you've got to teach it to love and
[1:10:54] respect and to read the
[1:10:58] Bible Hallelujah you know one thing it
[1:11:01] was mention I'm just going to mention I
[1:11:02] thought it was a good point I was at one
[1:11:05] point in time I was in a meeting and and
[1:11:06] a brother made a good point that I never
[1:11:08] had really never had really considered
[1:11:10] too much before but I thought about it a
[1:11:11] lot and I know we have listen we have
[1:11:13] the Bible on our phones Bible on our
[1:11:15] computer Bible on my iPad I've got the
[1:11:17] Bible around I'm thankful I've got on
[1:11:18] all those devices but you know one thing
[1:11:21] they mentioned they said what about your
[1:11:22] little kids even if you're reading the
[1:11:24] Bible but you're reading it on your
[1:11:26] phone right and they don't see you open
[1:11:28] the Bible are are they going to know the
[1:11:30] difference in saying that is having
[1:11:32] devotional time is good pre are you
[1:11:36] hearing me are they going to know the
[1:11:37] difference with that you say well
[1:11:38] brother Samuel they they ought to know
[1:11:39] it know you've got to be clear it's got
[1:11:43] to be intentionally
[1:11:45] clear is that all
[1:11:47] right woo Proverbs 22:6 is it hot in
[1:11:51] here is it just
[1:11:52] me I know it's hot in here we could
[1:11:56] probably cook some stuff in here verse
[1:11:58] six train up a child in the way he
[1:12:03] should go and when he is old he will not
[1:12:07] depart from it now notice that train up
[1:12:10] a child in the way no we don't we don't
[1:12:11] make them but we train them up we show
[1:12:14] them we direct them train them up in the
[1:12:17] way they should go and when he is old he
[1:12:20] will not depart from it right so
[1:12:24] it's a time of such molding and such
[1:12:26] Impressions look at Ephesians chap 6 and
[1:12:29] verse4 the Bible says bring them up the
[1:12:32] latter part of that verse bring them up
[1:12:34] in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:12:37] Lord and then they Amplified just so I
[1:12:39] don't have to Define every word rear
[1:12:41] them up tenderly in the training and
[1:12:44] discipline and the counsel and
[1:12:47] admonition of the Lord right well
[1:12:51] Brother Sam how do would I even begin
[1:12:53] let's just say respect how do I teach
[1:12:54] them Respect by you respecting all the
[1:12:57] rest of your brothers and sisters by you
[1:13:00] respecting Your Wife by you respecting
[1:13:03] your husband by you respecting one
[1:13:06] another right is that right now brother
[1:13:08] brandom teaches I tell you a powerful
[1:13:10] message you Ain listen to in a while the
[1:13:11] message respects but you remember the
[1:13:14] reason those little kids said what they
[1:13:16] did about Elisha and called him an old
[1:13:18] ballhead the prophet said is because
[1:13:20] their parents were talking about Ela now
[1:13:24] I'm just going to say it like this
[1:13:26] talking about other ministers other
[1:13:28] Ministries I don't care if it's wrong is
[1:13:29] wrong to me don't do it in front of your
[1:13:33] children don't do it because there might
[1:13:35] be a portion out of that that could be
[1:13:37] able to be a help you see it's teaching
[1:13:40] that respect to rever this is why the
[1:13:42] prophet could say even when he saw
[1:13:44] people that would get out of order in
[1:13:45] service and other things brother B says
[1:13:47] I'll never speak against it he said
[1:13:49] because it is the holy spirit even
[1:13:51] though it may not be in order
[1:13:54] order are you hearing me now there's
[1:13:57] what what does it did it say that
[1:13:58] brother was brother Bram saying he
[1:13:59] wasn't going to teach it bring the
[1:14:01] balance on it he no brother R was saying
[1:14:03] that at all he's saying that while while
[1:14:05] you see something that's out of order he
[1:14:06] said don't ever question ansers 59 don't
[1:14:09] ever disrespect the Holy
[1:14:12] Spirit are you hearing me oh my so we
[1:14:16] always we that that teaching of respect
[1:14:18] it's things that we in our lives how do
[1:14:21] we respect the message of the hour how
[1:14:23] do we respect the Bible how do we
[1:14:26] express love from one to another you see
[1:14:28] what I'm saying it's got to be something
[1:14:30] to where that our life should be the
[1:14:32] absolute picture or Canvas OR betrayal
[1:14:36] of what the love of God is in this hour
[1:14:39] you agree with that now notice this
[1:14:42] remember I read you this quote last week
[1:14:44] out of the message Elisha the prophet he
[1:14:46] said if a picture of a ship will impress
[1:14:48] boys to become Navy men remember them
[1:14:51] them five boys who became Navy men just
[1:14:53] just by looking they every morning every
[1:14:55] night they went to bed looking at that
[1:14:56] picture and when they woke up they saw
[1:14:58] that picture of a of a vessel on the sea
[1:15:01] all five of them went in to become Navy
[1:15:04] men and the prophet ends that story with
[1:15:07] he says if a picture of a ship will
[1:15:10] impress boys to become Navy men Sailors
[1:15:13] of the sea what ought the picture of the
[1:15:16] Lord Jesus Christ do always have the
[1:15:20] right thing before your
[1:15:24] children that's why listen when and I
[1:15:27] know when we have to give you know and
[1:15:29] different things come up listen all of
[1:15:31] that with smartphones and phones all
[1:15:33] that stuff was brand new for us I'm
[1:15:36] talking for me you got young ones right
[1:15:38] now different ones that raising families
[1:15:40] and and I mean it started a lot of times
[1:15:43] before they were born smartphones were
[1:15:44] already here the phones and the what I'm
[1:15:46] talking about is all the access and
[1:15:47] thing that's out there already and
[1:15:49] listen to me don't just look at somebody
[1:15:51] else and say well they were this age or
[1:15:53] they were this old you have to know your
[1:15:56] children you say is that Bible Jesus
[1:15:58] said he knows his Sheep by name meaning
[1:16:01] their
[1:16:04] characteristic are you hearing me it's
[1:16:06] established also with with a trust it's
[1:16:09] something that even with little things
[1:16:11] you might say brother Samuel do you
[1:16:12] really have to say this I believe I do
[1:16:14] as he's bringing it to me I think it
[1:16:16] ought to be open enough to where that
[1:16:18] it's not just something that it's off
[1:16:20] boundaries you should know what's going
[1:16:22] on on that phone
[1:16:26] one of the conferences I was at some
[1:16:28] years ago little ones that were six
[1:16:31] years
[1:16:32] old they caught things to where they
[1:16:34] were looking at things on their laptop
[1:16:37] and the mother said that's impossible
[1:16:40] the only time she has this is when she's
[1:16:43] sitting by me on the couch doing
[1:16:48] homeschooling you understand I mean you
[1:16:50] know how it was I mean you can give
[1:16:52] probably the littlest one in here give
[1:16:53] them something right man they know how
[1:16:56] to get around on things don't they they
[1:16:57] could teach us older ones something they
[1:16:59] just just sit down a minute I'll teach
[1:17:00] you how to do it they may not even be
[1:17:02] able to see Dad D yet but they can
[1:17:03] there's just something about it innate
[1:17:05] that they just kind of move right to it
[1:17:07] is that right that's why there's things
[1:17:10] at times I have to ask my boys hey hey
[1:17:12] how do how do I do this how do I clip
[1:17:13] this
[1:17:15] or but always having I I believe we
[1:17:17] ought to be that that involved and
[1:17:19] invested that's not distrust that's
[1:17:21] watching over even our
[1:17:25] home oh my man I I tell you where do you
[1:17:29] where where does time
[1:17:31] go it doesn't mean that we stand at the
[1:17:34] door like Hitler hand over your
[1:17:38] phone and they March off to the bedroom
[1:17:41] I I'm I'm saying that not not to be
[1:17:43] funny it maybe kind of helps you to
[1:17:44] break up a little bit but to understand
[1:17:46] friends that these things are not
[1:17:48] applied in a dictator way it's with a
[1:17:51] genuine love and
[1:17:56] trust a trust a trust a trust always
[1:18:01] have the right thing before your
[1:18:02] children bring up a child in the way
[1:18:04] that it should go bring it up and teach
[1:18:06] it right it certainly won't depart from
[1:18:08] it now I referred here um in the other
[1:18:14] the last week I referred and I just
[1:18:15] wanted to just show this to you here the
[1:18:18] prophet is referring go ahead and and
[1:18:21] and move me over here on this please
[1:18:23] brother brandham refers to this picture
[1:18:26] and this the Hoffman's head of Christ
[1:18:29] and you know brother brand would say
[1:18:31] many times you said I can tell a lot by
[1:18:34] a home when I go into it and what's
[1:18:36] around and what's on the walls and
[1:18:38] things and when you look at it you see
[1:18:42] how that brother Brandon would talk
[1:18:44] about in spiritual food and due season
[1:18:47] of how that the presence of the Lord and
[1:18:50] how that the coming of the Lord and in
[1:18:52] the picture he would refer to this
[1:18:53] picture right here that was taken there
[1:18:56] on Sunset mountain and he would refer to
[1:18:59] that which you realize on the in the
[1:19:01] magazine it was turned the other way
[1:19:03] because it's Christ looking down to the
[1:19:05] Earth but that event that took place and
[1:19:08] yet the prophet here would refer that
[1:19:10] and said regarding this picture right
[1:19:13] here he said you know he said I never
[1:19:15] had seen this picture till I had come
[1:19:17] into the office of Billy Sunday in his
[1:19:20] Tabernacle long time ago he said I never
[1:19:22] seen that picture of the Hoffman's head
[1:19:24] he said but when I saw it in his office
[1:19:26] he said that is exactly how he looked
[1:19:29] when he appeared to me right there in
[1:19:32] that lot where Parkview Junior High
[1:19:34] School
[1:19:35] is is that right and this is the
[1:19:37] statement that he made he says my house
[1:19:40] has never been without one of those
[1:19:41] pictures
[1:19:43] since it's pretty powerful
[1:19:47] statement now when you think of even
[1:19:50] that right there brother Randon would
[1:19:51] even take it in this time in this hour
[1:19:54] and he would talk about even even the
[1:19:56] pictures and he would talk about the
[1:19:58] picture that we recognize here this is
[1:20:00] taken in Houston Texas when the
[1:20:03] challenge was put onto the ministry of
[1:20:08] of of the Lord Jesus in this hour and
[1:20:10] how that when we look at this you know
[1:20:12] when we look at this right here let me
[1:20:14] see if I can get this off of here when I
[1:20:17] look at this picture here uh I'm not my
[1:20:20] my eyes well that's good my eyes do not
[1:20:23] just stop right there with brother
[1:20:26] brandham that right there when Brother
[1:20:28] brandham Talks of this picture he says
[1:20:30] he had his picture taken with
[1:20:34] us and what I'm talking about that
[1:20:36] Pillar of Fire that logos of God the
[1:20:40] word of God God's thoughts the same
[1:20:43] Pillar of Fire that led them out of
[1:20:46] Egypt the same Pillar of Fire that led
[1:20:49] them all along what did it do it took
[1:20:50] them out of Egypt and into the the
[1:20:52] promised
[1:20:54] land is that right now brother R will
[1:20:57] talk about this this picture right here
[1:20:59] and he speaks of how a lady and I'm just
[1:21:02] just dropping the because I made a
[1:21:03] couple statements last week and I wanted
[1:21:05] to be very clear about it brother BR
[1:21:07] says how this little lady had this
[1:21:09] picture he said most people put it in a
[1:21:10] frame and and put the story behind it
[1:21:12] and he says out of he said here he said
[1:21:15] what took place he said a little lady
[1:21:17] was in the hospital and she was dying he
[1:21:19] said the doctor had given her up with
[1:21:21] cancer he said and this is her testimony
[1:21:24] that she said the pillar of fire came
[1:21:27] out of that picture and hung over her
[1:21:30] and he said in two days she was
[1:21:32] dismissed from the hospital that was the
[1:21:35] testimony that he received he said now
[1:21:38] look he he says it like this I'm just
[1:21:40] going to read this and you listen to
[1:21:42] what he says he said she just looked at
[1:21:44] it and believed he said now we know to
[1:21:47] look at it any other way would be
[1:21:51] idolatry we wouldn't do that it's not
[1:21:54] the picture it's what it represents so
[1:21:57] you understand
[1:22:00] [Laughter]
[1:22:01] that all right you can switch me back to
[1:22:03] the notes now so when we look at this in
[1:22:06] Psalms 127 coming back to our scriptures
[1:22:10] I I tell you I really believe with all
[1:22:12] my heart you you can say whatever you
[1:22:13] want to say about me but I'll tell you
[1:22:15] those are pictures that I do have in my
[1:22:17] home because I'm not ashamed of all
[1:22:19] first of all to be identified with the
[1:22:22] message of the hour and I'm not just
[1:22:24] talking about having a picture of it but
[1:22:26] I have experienced that same Reality by
[1:22:30] the pillar of fire that brought this
[1:22:32] message I'm not ashamed of it it's not
[1:22:35] just something that hangs in my office
[1:22:37] or something that hangs in my home it's
[1:22:40] what I am a partaker of the reality of
[1:22:44] Jesus Christ in this
[1:22:46] hour Hallelujah the Lord is that all
[1:22:50] right now you say brother Samuel what
[1:22:53] what what about there a picture well
[1:22:55] I'll tell you what I've got enough
[1:22:56] confidence to believe that if it has
[1:22:59] already when even brother B said them
[1:23:01] tapes were being played there in Jamaica
[1:23:03] he said how that the pillar of fire came
[1:23:05] out came over and hovered right over
[1:23:07] that tape player as that tape was being
[1:23:09] played out I'm going tell you something
[1:23:11] I want the pillar of fire to be welcome
[1:23:13] to deal with every one of my children I
[1:23:16] want the pillar of fire to be ever so
[1:23:18] welcome when needs and situations come I
[1:23:21] need him because I need his leadership
[1:23:24] and guidance in my life Lord teach me
[1:23:28] thy
[1:23:31] ways Psalms
[1:23:33] 127:1 except the Lord build the house
[1:23:36] they labor in vain that build it except
[1:23:39] the Lord keep the city The Watchman
[1:23:41] waketh but in
[1:23:43] vain notice this in verse 49 of Acts 7
[1:23:47] this is what the Lord here as he would
[1:23:50] speak even regarding the house that was
[1:23:51] going to be built by by Solomon what
[1:23:53] house will you build me what a question
[1:23:56] what house will you build me and it goes
[1:23:59] on to express you know in that scripture
[1:24:01] of that my hands have made all these
[1:24:02] other things my hands have made this my
[1:24:05] my hand all of the materials that that
[1:24:07] are used my hands have made these things
[1:24:09] so it isn't something that we in
[1:24:11] ourselves want to do of an Earthly
[1:24:14] origin but what we realize that as we're
[1:24:17] walking here in this earth that there is
[1:24:20] a desire that I desire to reflect the
[1:24:23] Heavenly in the Earthly so in order for
[1:24:26] that there has to be an opening a
[1:24:28] channel a connection Lord I I need that
[1:24:31] Reflection from Heaven to come down and
[1:24:34] Tabernacle and reflect through this earn
[1:24:38] vessel is that right now notice this
[1:24:41] here when you think of it the Bible says
[1:24:43] in Exodus 258 when God was speaking to
[1:24:46] Moses and let them make me a
[1:24:50] sanctuary that I may dwell well among
[1:24:52] them now you know think about it
[1:24:54] couldn't God have just come down and put
[1:24:56] it all together he could have man he
[1:24:58] could have spoke it it just come
[1:25:00] together is that right it it could have
[1:25:03] happened that way but God shows that
[1:25:05] there's a part in it that every vessel
[1:25:08] every life were entrusted with certain
[1:25:10] things like you might have the black onx
[1:25:12] stones and you might have the goats hair
[1:25:14] and you might have the you know the the
[1:25:16] you know the diamonds you might have the
[1:25:18] you know the topaz and you know God
[1:25:19] never said hey you give topaz and hey
[1:25:21] you give black onyx and hey you give God
[1:25:23] never had to say one thing all he did
[1:25:25] was unfold the
[1:25:27] vision and it had an effect on people's
[1:25:30] lives to surrender the gifts that God
[1:25:33] had already put in their
[1:25:35] life ain't that powerful that you look
[1:25:37] for Lord how can I serve you he's
[1:25:39] already put it within you all you got to
[1:25:41] do is surrender when when you surrender
[1:25:43] and say Lord I just surrender to you
[1:25:45] even as it goes little by little Lord
[1:25:48] let everything let your life so overtake
[1:25:50] me I I want to be more overtaken by
[1:25:52] am notice that I may dwell among them
[1:25:56] according to all that I show thee after
[1:25:58] the pattern of the Tabernacle and the
[1:26:01] pattern of all of the instruments
[1:26:03] thereof even so shall you make it so we
[1:26:07] understand that it's the right materials
[1:26:09] placed according to the blueprint and
[1:26:11] how that God think about when God came
[1:26:13] down and inhabited that Tabernacle think
[1:26:16] about how when God came down that itself
[1:26:19] when God came and and dwelt there above
[1:26:23] that Tabernacle in the wilderness that
[1:26:25] was God saying you've done exactly what
[1:26:29] I've told you to
[1:26:32] dolu now you think there wasn't some
[1:26:34] times where there might have been
[1:26:35] thoughts of here and there well this may
[1:26:38] not you know this this a little too
[1:26:41] detailed go it's just a little too much
[1:26:44] God's presence only recognizes
[1:26:49] himself and when he comes he's
[1:26:52] recognizing his word oh God let
[1:26:56] everything Lord within me let it be set
[1:26:59] in order according to your word Lord is
[1:27:01] that your desire Lord let it be Lord
[1:27:04] notice this you know when you think
[1:27:06] about even when we were looking at you
[1:27:08] know and the consecrating and the ring
[1:27:11] around the gift of God that we were
[1:27:13] talking about with the Queen of Sheba uh
[1:27:15] the last time and looking at how that
[1:27:17] you know coming around it we we
[1:27:19] recognize that it's not just when we
[1:27:21] talk about WAP ing around the gift of
[1:27:23] God we're talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:27:25] we're not just talking about where we
[1:27:27] come and we sense his presence but we're
[1:27:29] real rallying around it is where we
[1:27:32] surrender our lives and give oursel to
[1:27:35] him and that that same presence comes
[1:27:37] into our life and changes us and gives
[1:27:41] direction to our
[1:27:42] lives that's the real rallying around
[1:27:45] the gift of God that's how we rally
[1:27:48] around his
[1:27:51] presence
[1:27:52] ah night look at this in the message
[1:27:55] taking sides with
[1:27:58] Jesus now we got to think of young
[1:28:01] people brother BRS I want you to notice
[1:28:03] what he says he's he's speaking to a
[1:28:04] group of Brethren here in this message
[1:28:07] this is a Brother's meeting actually
[1:28:09] this message right after brother Brams
[1:28:11] preached restoration of the brid tree
[1:28:14] and he says we got children and most of
[1:28:16] us people here married men has children
[1:28:20] well what about them that's coming on
[1:28:23] now he's talking to brothers who are
[1:28:25] believing and walking within the message
[1:28:27] of all that God has shown at that time
[1:28:29] but he's directing their focus we've all
[1:28:32] got children that's coming on what about
[1:28:34] them now watch how he apply app applies
[1:28:37] this here he says like I used to kick up
[1:28:40] down here and throwing about them
[1:28:42] throwing and casting Nets on the river
[1:28:44] and pulling out them perch and the
[1:28:47] drinks and drunkards and things and I've
[1:28:49] seen them piled up high as this ceiling
[1:28:51] here big fine perch laying there and the
[1:28:53] stink would be all around the river I
[1:28:56] went down as the game War to make them
[1:28:58] stop it I got a letter it said I got a
[1:29:01] letter that said leave them alone what
[1:29:03] are you going to do it belongs to
[1:29:05] Kentucky so you getting the gist of it
[1:29:07] that people were going beyond their
[1:29:10] limits they just were fishing and
[1:29:12] fishing and going Beyond and brother
[1:29:14] Bram was a great game more and went down
[1:29:16] to make him stop that you know throwing
[1:29:18] stuff in the river and everything else
[1:29:20] but he got a letter from the state and
[1:29:23] said stand down don't do
[1:29:26] nothing now Kentucky Warden can't come
[1:29:30] over here because he's out of his
[1:29:31] territory Indiana Warden has nothing to
[1:29:34] say into it because the water belongs to
[1:29:36] Kentucky there you are nothing can be
[1:29:38] done now watch as he says this he's
[1:29:39] applying this I've got a boy coming on
[1:29:42] that would like to fish why they put his
[1:29:44] paper in the P paper if he caught a chub
[1:29:47] 20 years from now let that go on like
[1:29:49] that those Nets and traps and everything
[1:29:52] else what he's saying is is if he
[1:29:55] catches something that's common right
[1:29:57] now to catch he would he would picture
[1:29:59] would be in a paper because it's
[1:30:03] rare right see it been the over fishing
[1:30:06] so now he's bringing this and applying
[1:30:08] it it's practically getting that right
[1:30:10] now what's the matter you've got to
[1:30:13] think of these that's coming on now he
[1:30:15] brings it back to as our children our
[1:30:19] families we've got to think of the other
[1:30:22] that's coming on behind us now let me
[1:30:23] just pause here for a moment you might
[1:30:26] be sitting here and say well I no longer
[1:30:28] have children here these are messages on
[1:30:30] family apply to the whole entire
[1:30:36] assembly it applies we we have a
[1:30:39] responsibility as an entire

[1:30:48] home and your household is pointed and
[1:30:51] moving in in the right direction I have
[1:30:53] a responsibility for this household to
[1:30:56] make sure it's pointed in the right
[1:31:00] direction yeah it's a big responsibility
[1:31:03] pray for me I pray for you I trust you
[1:31:07] do we've got to think of the others
[1:31:09] that's coming on behind us these young
[1:31:10] people and so forth and a place for our
[1:31:13] children our daughters we don't want
[1:31:16] them out in the world in these things
[1:31:18] like that we want them girls raised up
[1:31:21] like their mothers we've got to make
[1:31:24] arrangements for that and if there is no
[1:31:27] tomorrow we don't know that if there is
[1:31:30] no tomorrow we haven't done nothing but
[1:31:33] been at the Master's business and been
[1:31:36] found at our post of Duty when he does
[1:31:39] come we have our responsibility so now
[1:31:42] with the word that's been entrusted to
[1:31:44] us it's our responsibility making
[1:31:47] arrangements for our children coming on
[1:31:50] making arrangements
[1:31:52] for our children's children brother
[1:31:54] Samuel I I believe the Rapture is going
[1:31:55] to come any day I do too but remember
[1:31:59] plant potatoes that's right you may not
[1:32:02] Harvest them but plant
[1:32:05] them this is this is responsibility
[1:32:08] arrangements for things that's coming on
[1:32:10] of preparations making those
[1:32:13] arrangements in the life not only as
[1:32:15] brother B would deal with that that that
[1:32:17] of of what is before us with a place and
[1:32:20] a house of worship but in every
[1:32:21] everything that we're doing making an
[1:32:23] arrangement now notice this here in
[1:32:26] numbers 152 I've got one more one more
[1:32:28] area I want to deal with here in numbers
[1:32:31] 152 the Bible says the children of
[1:32:33] Israel shall pitch their tents every man
[1:32:36] by his own camp and every man by his own
[1:32:39] standard throughout their host but the
[1:32:42] Levites shall pitch round about the
[1:32:44] Tabernacle of the testimony that there
[1:32:47] be no wrath upon the congregation of the
[1:32:50] children of Israel and the the Levites
[1:32:52] shall keep the charge of the Tabernacle
[1:32:55] of Moos of of of testimony brother Brian
[1:32:58] go to those slides one more time switch
[1:33:00] over to that that area right there just
[1:33:02] reach over there and hit that for me I
[1:33:04] just want to show this the the picture
[1:33:06] here of that and you're you're familiar
[1:33:08] with this and what I I want you to think
[1:33:10] about when you're looking at this
[1:33:11] picture I wonder many of us how many
[1:33:13] seen this picture before very very
[1:33:15] familiar with this there's many other
[1:33:17] pictures out there but the visual part
[1:33:19] of it when it speaks of how that their t
[1:33:22] were to be pitched around the Tabernacle
[1:33:25] in the wilderness and what's very
[1:33:28] important with it it's not just that
[1:33:31] they would be around where the
[1:33:32] Tabernacle of the Wilderness or the
[1:33:35] Tabernacle the testimony because what
[1:33:36] this speaks of is it speaks of God's
[1:33:39] Dwelling Place in the heart of man it
[1:33:42] speaks of Jesus Christ that Tabernacle
[1:33:46] because you and I are the Tabernacle of
[1:33:49] the Living God we're also stoned in
[1:33:52] Lively stones in that in that Temple is
[1:33:54] that right now to think that every
[1:33:57] everyone underneath under their family
[1:34:00] they were to they were to pitch their
[1:34:02] tent now I want you to think of it just
[1:34:04] like this this is a simple picture but
[1:34:06] you'll realize when you look down on
[1:34:08] this Tabernacle here that how that each
[1:34:10] one of them and each one of them tribes
[1:34:13] of how it was so placed around the
[1:34:15] Tabernacle so what was at the center
[1:34:18] they were looking and beholding the
[1:34:20] Tabernacle of the Lord that's what was
[1:34:23] before him now it wasn't enough for them
[1:34:25] just to say you know what I'm going to
[1:34:27] bring my tent and I'll put it wherever I
[1:34:29] want to put it nope you have to be
[1:34:30] positionally placed that's right is that
[1:34:33] right has to abide by that standard
[1:34:37] right is that right has to abide there
[1:34:39] and the other thing of it is is that
[1:34:41] when they pitched they did not it was
[1:34:43] not just an option of you just put your
[1:34:46] door and face anywhere you want to face
[1:34:48] you know I mean just no everything was
[1:34:50] orderly their door to their tent faced
[1:34:55] the glory of
[1:34:56] God so no matter where you came from Dad
[1:35:00] facing the glory of God Mom facing the
[1:35:03] glory of God in the glory of God this
[1:35:05] home's facing the glory of God it's
[1:35:07] facing it's keeping him in view if he
[1:35:11] becomes just a peripheral don't make
[1:35:13] that decision bring it back to him and
[1:35:16] let him be the focus for everything in
[1:35:20] your life
[1:35:22] he's to be the center of our
[1:35:25] conversations the center of all of our
[1:35:29] doings is that right the center and de
[1:35:33] see what a blessing that is as we read
[1:35:35] in our text the opening of that what a
[1:35:38] blessing that is when he is the center
[1:35:41] now I want you to think how brother Bram
[1:35:43] when he brings us here in what house
[1:35:45] will you build me and I I'm coming down
[1:35:46] here I'm trying to to bring it down here
[1:35:48] to a place but when brother Bram
[1:35:51] preached is that message what house will
[1:35:52] you build me and I mentioned to you last
[1:35:54] week if you hadn't listened to that
[1:35:55] message please listen to it it's 28
[1:35:58] minutes long but it's it's a it's a
[1:36:00] powerful message it has such an
[1:36:03] Direction cuz when the title is given
[1:36:05] what house will you build me it's
[1:36:07] speaking
[1:36:09] individually what house will you build
[1:36:11] me individually it's speaking as a
[1:36:14] church what house will you build me it's
[1:36:18] speaking of the entirety what house will
[1:36:20] you build me I know whatever it is and I
[1:36:23] think we can join together on this
[1:36:25] whatever it is in my life I want him to
[1:36:27] be able to
[1:36:28] dwell I want him to be able to say I
[1:36:31] feel at home with Samuel I feel at home
[1:36:34] with his decisions I feel at home
[1:36:36] because I want to be influenced by him
[1:36:38] don't
[1:36:39] you now don't get quiet on me friends
[1:36:42] well I've made a wrong decision don't
[1:36:43] don't don't don't let the enemy beat you
[1:36:45] up you've got an opportunity right here
[1:36:47] right now don't miss the things that God
[1:36:49] has given and speaking to our Hearts
[1:36:51] right now is that right now notice this
[1:36:54] brother Brandon's whole burden when he
[1:36:56] even preaches this he's letting him know
[1:36:58] because a church has just been started
[1:37:00] right there brother Perry green has just
[1:37:02] moved up there from Texas it's been a
[1:37:04] burden brother Bram said the main thing
[1:37:06] that's burdened my heart is there was no
[1:37:08] place here in Arizona for the people to
[1:37:11] come and worship now watch as he says
[1:37:14] this he says if God has spoke to brother
[1:37:16] and sister green to come here and has
[1:37:18] opened a place where our children
[1:37:20] instead of on Sunday morning riding
[1:37:22] their bicycles on the streets and
[1:37:24] running around they have a place to come
[1:37:27] to worship instead of us sitting around
[1:37:29] and listening to something we've heard
[1:37:31] on the radio which is all right but we
[1:37:34] as this group of people we have a
[1:37:36] message for this day we believe that God
[1:37:40] has given us a message and he talking
[1:37:43] about brother Perry green left
[1:37:45] everything that was dear to him to come
[1:37:47] to the desert just to support what God
[1:37:50] is giv giving to us now he said I
[1:37:53] believe watch this it's not only should
[1:37:55] be in our hearts it should be our duty
[1:38:00] to back him up amen how many say Amen to
[1:38:02] that so it's not just say in my heart
[1:38:06] but it's Duty what what's in my heart to
[1:38:08] come
[1:38:09] out everything that we can to attend the
[1:38:13] services to come here to worship and to
[1:38:16] make this a place where God can reveal
[1:38:19] to us the things that he has for us to
[1:38:23] reveal now I certainly believe in a nice
[1:38:25] building I thank God that he's given us
[1:38:26] a nice building thank the Lord today for
[1:38:28] the oven we're
[1:38:33] in but I thank God for for for a nice
[1:38:36] place to worship but do you realize we
[1:38:38] could have all of this right here and
[1:38:41] still not have
[1:38:44] him what makes this a nice place to come
[1:38:47] and worship by consecrated hearts
[1:38:52] amen is that right a consecrated life
[1:38:55] individually daily in our walk with God
[1:38:58] our desire to please God and remember
[1:39:01] don't don't as I said comparison we
[1:39:04] don't want to compare ourselves not only
[1:39:06] do I not want to compare myself with the
[1:39:07] world God never called you and I to
[1:39:09] compare ourselves with one another
[1:39:10] that's right we're to look and let our
[1:39:13] lives be evaluated by
[1:39:16] him by the word alone Lord what do you
[1:39:19] say about my life
[1:39:22] right now notice this he says where God
[1:39:24] can reveal to us the things that he has
[1:39:26] to reveal to us and as his word said the
[1:39:29] message brother brother green said the
[1:39:31] message doesn't come to me through the
[1:39:32] giving of the inspiration as it as it
[1:39:34] does to maybe to some of us but he said
[1:39:37] I am here to back up what God has given
[1:39:40] let me just tell you that's what I'm
[1:39:42] here to do anybody else with me I'm here
[1:39:44] to back up what God has
[1:39:47] given Oh Brother Sam I got to prove it
[1:39:50] why waste your time God's already done
[1:39:52] [Applause]
[1:39:53] it God's already proved it why don't you
[1:39:56] just give yourself to him and let him
[1:39:57] prove it in
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:39:59] you that he's the same yesterday today
[1:40:02] and forever I'm here to back up what God
[1:40:05] has given what a statement and I believe
[1:40:07] if we will all cooperate together we'll
[1:40:11] put our hearts to it amen Brianna go
[1:40:15] down to the last quote in that message
[1:40:17] please where it starts out I begin
[1:40:19] brother Bram now notice he's he's he's
[1:40:21] been watching the people that's gathered
[1:40:22] out there remember he told people don't
[1:40:24] come out here where I'm at at Arizona he
[1:40:26] told him that but now he's seen people
[1:40:29] that followed him I mean listen
[1:40:32] friends think about if you or I were
[1:40:34] there think about the ministry and what
[1:40:36] you've seen will you tell me you
[1:40:38] wouldn't be tempted to go
[1:40:40] either it's
[1:40:43] true it's true look at this he sees them
[1:40:48] all as they just he says I see things we
[1:40:50] all we we need a little bit of picking
[1:40:51] up in our life as he said the previous
[1:40:53] paragraph but he says I begin to I begin
[1:40:55] to feel us all reclining and getting
[1:40:59] away from the spirit it's become too
[1:41:01] natural a thing to us we must Worship in
[1:41:05] the spirit not only our message should
[1:41:07] be the flame of the hour it should be
[1:41:10] the flame in our
[1:41:13] hearts not just the flame of the hour in
[1:41:16] our hearts it's got to be in our hearts
[1:41:21] or we can't rightly present it to the
[1:41:23] people the spirit has to pack the
[1:41:27] message itself now I just thought kind
[1:41:31] of like a little bonus here because I
[1:41:33] know how brother Bram talked about this
[1:41:34] with when he was very burdened about the
[1:41:36] those Gathering out there in Arizona in
[1:41:39] question answers 1964 he said I was
[1:41:42] called in on something like this the
[1:41:43] other day he's talking about it I don't
[1:41:44] know if I put that in there or not
[1:41:46] pardon me sometimes I shorten these
[1:41:48] things up yeah brother br's talking
[1:41:50] about how how ministers were complaining
[1:41:52] to him and saying brother brandom you
[1:41:53] know you people that come out here to
[1:41:55] follow they don't even go to
[1:41:57] church now brother BR says
[1:42:00] look you need to go to
[1:42:03] church he said but you don't accept what
[1:42:06] they are teaching you their Dogma spit
[1:42:10] that out right he's talking about being
[1:42:13] about about being an example now notice
[1:42:16] what he says regarding this he says Put
[1:42:18] them kids in Sunday school somewhere and
[1:42:21] you go to church don't set at home go
[1:42:24] fishing and hunting and things like that
[1:42:26] on Sunday you say well I'm not a
[1:42:30] legalist well you better be in that
[1:42:32] manner for a
[1:42:38] while woo
[1:42:40] Glory well you better be in that manner
[1:42:43] for a while dishonoring the resurrection
[1:42:45] of Christ you go to church
[1:42:49] somewhere another one question ansers
[1:42:51] number two I believe that I believe we
[1:42:53] should honor that Resurrection as a
[1:42:58] memorial let me just finish this trying
[1:43:00] to finish this part out
[1:43:04] here every time when the camp in numbers
[1:43:07] 2 and verse 17 the Bible says that the
[1:43:11] Tabernacle the congregation Shall Set
[1:43:13] forward with the camp of the Levites in
[1:43:16] the midst of the camp as they encamp so
[1:43:19] shall they set forward every man in his
[1:43:22] place by their
[1:43:24] standards
[1:43:26] so the only
[1:43:28] direction that we're to have is
[1:43:32] forward I'm not going
[1:43:34] backward I'm going
[1:43:37] forward it's where when God would tell
[1:43:40] them to set up the camp listen they
[1:43:43] would have to pack that up everyone had
[1:43:46] a charge to pack it up and move it to a
[1:43:50] certain to wherever the pillar of fire
[1:43:52] LED them and said let's stop right here
[1:43:55] then the Levites would go everyone that
[1:43:57] had a specific charge and responsibility
[1:44:01] would
[1:44:01] begin to unpack unfold and begin to set
[1:44:05] up that Tabernacle and then every one of
[1:44:08] them that had been marching in line they
[1:44:11] once again just like we showed on that
[1:44:13] picture they would set up around the
[1:44:16] Tabernacle according to where they
[1:44:18] belonged and in their standard
[1:44:21] and beholding the glory of God think
[1:44:24] about how crucial it would
[1:44:25] be
