[23:01] just for a few moments tonight and if
[23:04] you would turn with me to Psalms chapter
[23:07] 34 it's okay don't look for him I didn't
[23:12] send any to you in Psalms chapter 34 and
[23:17] then I thought perhaps that I'll speak
[23:20] for a few for a little bit and then we
[23:22] have a testimony and maybe some songs
[23:26] and we'll just approach the service that
[23:28] way tonight just have a thought on the
[23:31] heart that some months ago and looking
[23:34] at this whole journey of the children of
[23:37] Israel just another part of it and I
[23:40] want to look here in Psalms 34 verse 1 I
[23:44] want to say I so appreciate your prayers
[23:47] while we were gone we were there in the
[23:50] youth retreat and the just just some
[23:53] wonderful wonderful services the Lord
[23:56] had given to us and many many hearts
[24:00] were touched in many different ways and
[24:02] we've just been getting just getting
[24:05] different reports back as well there's a
[24:07] lot of things that you could see a lot
[24:08] of things that the Lord was doing right
[24:11] then and there but we just continued to
[24:13] get reports back from that and they're
[24:16] not just last last night I just got back
[24:19] here today from brother Jeff Snodgrass
[24:21] we were down there with them last night
[24:23] to speak for them as well so I had
[24:27] already planned on going down there but
[24:28] I hadn't planned on winter youth retreat
[24:31] so there's kind of added to everything
[24:35] what we've had so we had a good service
[24:37] down there last night and many hearts
[24:39] were touched so I just want to say I
[24:41] appreciate your prayers and certainly is
[24:43] good to be back here and I'm interested
[24:47] I'm anxious to get back into my schedule
[24:51] very anxious for that
[24:52] so let's look in Psalms 34 verse 1 a
[24:57] psalm of David when he changed his
[24:59] behavior before a Benwick who drove him
[25:02] away and he departed David said I will
[25:05] bless the Lord at all times his praise
[25:07] shall continually be in my mouth my soul
[25:12] shall make her boast in the Lord the
[25:15] humble shall hear thereof and be glad
[25:18] notice who will hear it the humble Oh
[25:22] magnify the Lord with me and let us
[25:24] exalt his name together I sought the
[25:28] Lord and he heard me and delivered me
[25:31] from all my fears they looked unto him
[25:35] and were lightened and their faces were
[25:37] not ashamed this poor man cried and the
[25:41] Lord heard him and saved him out of all
[25:44] of his troubles the angel of the Lord in
[25:47] Campa throned about them that fear him
[25:49] and deliver them Oh taste and see that
[25:53] the Lord is good
[25:54] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[25:57] and all fear the Lord he is Saints for
[26:01] there is no want to them that fear him
[26:04] the Young Lions do lack and suffer
[26:07] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[26:11] not want
[26:11] any good thing let's just bow our heads
[26:16] in order prayer tonight Heavenly Father
[26:20] Lord as we just come before you this
[26:23] evening we're just so thankful dear God
[26:25] for your grace and mercy Lord once again
[26:28] we find ourselves the Lord here Lord in
[26:31] the beginning and opening of another
[26:33] year and Lord were just so thankful Lord
[26:36] for your grace and mercy that Lord has
[26:39] brought us through the previous year we
[26:41] thank you Father for Lord all the tests
[26:44] and trials Lord and the grace that
[26:46] you've given Lord for us to be able
[26:48] to come through them father Lord for
[26:51] even Lord and tests that we failed we
[26:53] thank you for grace Lord that you would
[26:56] give us the strength Lord God and father
[26:58] Lord to take him again Lord we just
[27:01] thank you so much Lord God so many needs
[27:04] and so much that we can reflect and
[27:06] recount upon Lord in the previous year
[27:08] and father we would Lord be mindful Lord
[27:11] to ask that you would forgive us Lord of
[27:13] our sins and our shortcomings Lord
[27:15] Father our mistakes Lord gone and
[27:18] failures Lord from the previous year
[27:20] Lord as we look to You Father Lord in
[27:22] this year or god that father that our
[27:25] hearts might draw closer to you Lord
[27:27] father is Lord with great anticipation
[27:30] Lord God we know that Lord we are one
[27:33] year one month Lord a day Lord gone an
[27:36] hour were closer Lord God Father Lord in
[27:40] your coming Lord God than we were Lord
[27:42] before and Lord God were just looking to
[27:45] you father and we pray that you would
[27:47] help us Lord to ever remain fervent Lord
[27:49] God and looking Lord God unto you father
[27:52] the Lord Jesus we love you tonight we
[27:55] pray that you'll just take your word and
[27:57] speak to our hearts Lord in a special
[27:59] way in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[28:02] amen God blesses your being seated I
[28:09] want to just just take that thought if
[28:13] we could hear in a thought here just on
[28:18] on that of more than enough more than
[28:23] enough I look here in the in the
[28:27] scriptures and there's some scriptures
[28:28] we're going to be referring to here
[28:31] throughout but there's parts here that
[28:35] where it speaks in the text that we read
[28:38] in Psalms 34 verse 9 Oh fear the Lord he
[28:43] is Saints for there is no want to them
[28:46] that fear him you know there's nothing
[28:51] that you we can look at this we have
[28:53] needs but there is no lack but anything
[28:57] that he himself is not already provided
[29:01] and what
[29:02] we have need of versed in goes on to say
[29:06] that the Young Lions do lack and suffer
[29:08] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[29:11] not want any good thing you know it
[29:15] would be one thing if the Scriptures
[29:17] said there that the old lions but you
[29:20] know when you look many times the older
[29:22] Lions they get to a place that they can
[29:25] no longer hunt they can no longer do the
[29:29] things that they normally could do they
[29:31] don't have the strength don't have the
[29:33] stamina they don't have the ability you
[29:36] know to take down the prey but here
[29:39] David puts it in a place that you and I
[29:41] would look at that it would seem very
[29:43] advantageous and he says that the Young
[29:45] Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they
[29:49] that seek the Lord shall not want any
[29:52] good thing I'll tell you what it what a
[29:55] promise that we have within the Lord to
[29:59] think and to realize that God he is
[30:01] mindful of every situation and all that
[30:05] we would have need of in our life and
[30:07] all that we come across in life's
[30:09] journey God has already taken all of
[30:12] this in into his is ilysm view and and
[30:17] provided for us what we have need of you
[30:20] know situations themselves you know when
[30:22] we we look at it when a need would arise
[30:25] and things within our life you know
[30:28] sometimes we look for things that can
[30:30] come externally but yet in reality what
[30:33] God he's already provided for us what's
[30:36] needed in order to bring to past what it
[30:40] is that we're looking for and we have a
[30:41] need whether it's for healing in our
[30:43] body whether it it's some you know sort
[30:46] of a financial need whatever it is we
[30:49] realize that God is mindful and he knows
[30:51] all things and he knows just what we
[30:54] have need of I know that's a very simple
[30:57] very simple part but I believe that we
[31:00] can look at that and really take
[31:02] strength from that here tonight I want
[31:04] to turn in the scriptures to 2nd Kings
[31:06] chapter 4 as well and I'd like to look
[31:08] here in this portion of the word and
[31:11] here we find that Elijah
[31:14] as coming in into a place where there is
[31:18] a need that has a rose and I want you to
[31:20] notice here in second Kings chapter 4
[31:22] verse 1 it says there cried a certain
[31:26] woman of the wives of the sons of the
[31:28] prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant
[31:32] my husband is dead and thou knowest that
[31:35] thy servant did fear the Lord and the
[31:38] creditor has come to take unto him my
[31:41] two sons to be bondman you see there was
[31:44] a testimony he feared the Lord verse 2
[31:49] and Elisha said to her what shall I do
[31:51] for thee tell me what has thou in thy
[31:55] house and she said that handmaid hath
[31:58] not anything in the house save a pot of
[32:01] oil then he said go borrow the vessels
[32:06] abroad of all thy neighbours even empty
[32:09] vessels borrow not a few and when thou
[32:13] art come in thou shalt shut the door
[32:15] upon thee and upon thy sons and shall
[32:18] pour out into all those vessels and thou
[32:21] shalt set aside that which is full now I
[32:26] want you to notice in these in the
[32:28] scriptures that were given here there is
[32:31] a need that is presented here to Elisha
[32:34] and Elijah responds to the to the widow
[32:38] was what one is it that you would ask of
[32:42] me you see when we look at just this
[32:45] principle as the children of God we are
[32:50] not beggars we're not even to approach
[32:54] the throne of God in a beggarly way the
[32:58] Scriptures never ever present that to us
[33:02] in any way as a matter of fact that
[33:04] would be a disrespect to our Heavenly
[33:07] Father but rather over and over in the
[33:10] scriptures we are admonished to ask
[33:12] where the more admonish to ask in faith
[33:15] the Lord Jesus would say when he was
[33:19] here upon earth walking in a corporal
[33:21] body ask the Father anything in my name
[33:23] and I will do it there was and there is
[33:26] nothing that
[33:27] is beyond God's doing now you and I you
[33:31] know I don't know about you but there's
[33:33] many times I when I come in contact with
[33:36] different people that even those that I
[33:37] worked with and you know sometimes they
[33:40] would have you know a little snide
[33:42] remarks of things that they would make
[33:44] and it the really the reality of it is
[33:46] is that they just didn't know the Lord
[33:48] they didn't know the way that they knew
[33:50] the Lord is a manner that is not a good
[33:54] proverb at all but the RAM calls it a
[33:56] God dishonouring proverb when people say
[33:59] that God only helps them who helps
[34:01] themselves brother Ram called that a God
[34:03] dishonouring proverb because that
[34:06] doesn't that that is not he says god
[34:08] helps those who cannot help themselves
[34:10] and that's the greatest thing that we
[34:13] can recognize is that in everything we
[34:16] need his help it doesn't matter even
[34:18] when we look at even the skills and
[34:21] whatever that we have in our life those
[34:23] skills that we have there is not things
[34:25] that we've accumulated it's things that
[34:27] God already knew would would they would
[34:30] rested there he placed in our lives
[34:32] schooling and other things can refine it
[34:34] but yet it's things that we know that it
[34:36] is entrusted to God and how many times
[34:39] you know I can I can recall where there
[34:41] would be things that would be mentioned
[34:43] maybe you know in a faculty meeting some
[34:45] little snide comment you know when I
[34:47] would mention maybe of how that God you
[34:50] know it and help me in certain things
[34:51] and you know help me within you know the
[34:54] testing and how to know to approach this
[34:56] and you know you'd get this and say well
[34:58] what God can't do it for you and you
[35:00] know you come right back and I look at
[35:02] and I thought well I told the person I
[35:04] said well I never said that he came down
[35:06] and did it I said I just happened to be
[35:08] the tool that he used I said what I'm
[35:10] saying is I said it's just he helped me
[35:13] I said in my littleness I said to catch
[35:15] what I needed to catch I said because I
[35:17] seen there was a need I said in yet I
[35:20] looked at it I didn't know how to make
[35:22] those ins me I said but I was asking for
[35:24] his help I said and he came down I said
[35:27] and he helped me I said that's all I'm
[35:29] testifying to is that he helped me I was
[35:32] in need you know many of the things we
[35:35] look at things and sometimes we we look
[35:37] at things in areas of our life and we
[35:39] can look at areas of
[35:41] life as though that this is a is a
[35:44] self-sufficient sustaining area that I
[35:47] do not need God's oversight but the
[35:49] reality is in every area of our life we
[35:52] do need his oversight we need his
[35:54] leadership we need his direction in
[35:56] every area of our life and I I believe
[35:59] that with all my heart that there is
[36:01] something within our hearts as believers
[36:03] that repels pride that it's something
[36:06] about it that as we mature in the Lord
[36:08] it's something that we can quickly begin
[36:10] to recognize that pride that would hang
[36:13] around from that first birth and you
[36:15] know as we're always trying to shed that
[36:18] thing even after we've been born again
[36:20] of the Spirit of God God even gave Paul
[36:23] divine assistance because Les Paul would
[36:26] rise in Pride and God you know was
[36:28] mindful of that and I'm glad he's
[36:30] mindful of that for you and I when
[36:32] there's things that God he brings us to
[36:34] in our life that there is no other place
[36:37] for us to go we can talk with somebody
[36:40] but the reality is it's we need help
[36:43] from the Lord
[36:44] we need his guidance we need his
[36:47] direction for our lives and here stands
[36:50] this Widow woman there's a testimony in
[36:52] this household
[36:53] of how her husband has stood and now
[36:56] there's a need that's arose the creditor
[36:58] has come to take you know Sons in
[37:01] possession and she looks around her
[37:03] house and she doesn't see anything that
[37:06] would be a value that would be a value
[37:09] in a sense that would take care of the
[37:11] debt there's something you know this one
[37:13] thing that you could look at things that
[37:14] you could pawn off and say this will
[37:17] take care of a debt this would satisfy a
[37:19] debt this would take care of that you
[37:21] can look for that but she was looking in
[37:23] her house and she knew I don't have
[37:25] anything that I can pawn off that will
[37:28] actually satisfy the debt but you see
[37:31] what she did what she didn't realize is
[37:34] that she really had a gold mine there
[37:36] and when it came there was a need in her
[37:39] life that then she could ask and say
[37:41] what when Elijah said what am I to do
[37:44] for thee and then Elijah directs her in
[37:47] simplicity to what is already in her
[37:50] possession you this was not something
[37:53] she went out to buy he
[37:55] never told her go out and buy oil but
[37:57] she already had it in her possession and
[38:00] what she had in her possession is really
[38:03] all it had to be is her faith released
[38:06] in the word that would take what was in
[38:09] her possession and would multiply it and
[38:12] meet the need and the challenge of the
[38:14] hour so the need arose and you know
[38:17] sometimes when needs arise she would
[38:19] have never seen this pot of oil and the
[38:22] real value and what it was unless a need
[38:25] would arose in our life I tell you it's
[38:27] one thing for you and I to know God's
[38:29] grace and how that it touches our life
[38:31] in the beginning but to think about it
[38:33] that where we stand right now in this
[38:36] hour it is God's grace that you and I
[38:38] are standing here today it's not our
[38:41] works it's not anything that we a good
[38:43] have done if anything that we've
[38:45] received any direction any correction
[38:48] any edification it is because of the
[38:50] grace of Almighty God not what we have
[38:54] deserved but God's grace and to look at
[38:57] this woman here she is she she then she
[39:00] doesn't argue she just simply says I'll
[39:04] go and do it
[39:05] and notice the Bible says that when she
[39:08] went from him the Bible says she shut
[39:10] the door in verse 5 upon her and upon
[39:13] her sons who brought the vessels to her
[39:15] and she poured out I want you to think
[39:18] of this there had to be something here
[39:21] that within this home to where when she
[39:23] you know the effect and testimony in
[39:26] this home was such a way to where that
[39:28] when this this little woman could go and
[39:31] she could tell her sons or her children
[39:33] say go and get many vessels met within
[39:36] them the scripture never records that
[39:38] they looked at mama and said mama what
[39:41] are we gonna do with vessels what is it
[39:43] gonna be about vessels but I believe
[39:44] there was a testimony that she brought
[39:46] before Elijah where they were serving
[39:49] the Lord and when it came time for a
[39:52] situation that arose they didn't know
[39:54] how the answer was going to come all
[39:56] they knew is just go do what the word
[39:59] has told you to do right now because if
[40:02] we can go and do what God has asked us
[40:05] to do
[40:06] then it's what God comes on the scene to
[40:09] fulfill and bring forth what we cannot
[40:12] do there's one thing that they could do
[40:14] they could gather the vessels and I want
[40:17] you to notice there was never a number
[40:19] fixed on this they never had men ever
[40:22] does never a question how many vessels
[40:24] but it was fully directed don't gather a
[40:27] few but you go get there every vessel
[40:29] and make sure their empty vessels and
[40:32] when you get them you bring him inside
[40:34] your house you you know there's certain
[40:36] things that God only wants you to know
[40:39] about sometimes there's things that God
[40:42] does for us personally he don't want to
[40:43] share it with nobody else but you see
[40:46] what he does in private the Bible says
[40:48] in Matthew 6:6 that the Lord that
[40:50] heareth and cieth in private will reward
[40:52] thee openly
[40:53] you see God knows exactly what he's
[40:56] doing and how that this little woman she
[40:58] moves brings in these vessels here her
[41:01] sons are bringing these vessels together
[41:03] and the Bible says that she began to
[41:06] pour into those vessels in verse 6 and
[41:09] when the vessels were full she said to
[41:11] her son bring me yet a vessel and he
[41:14] said unto her there's not a vessel more
[41:16] and the oil stayed so the miracle itself
[41:21] was not about the vessels but the
[41:25] vessels were containing a miracle
[41:27] because it was the oil that was the
[41:31] miracle because there was just a pot of
[41:35] oil but there were many vessels that
[41:38] were gathered with the purpose for the
[41:41] oil to fill up vessels you see this is
[41:44] just exactly here we see the time of the
[41:47] Lord Jesus Christ that he is the true
[41:49] living vessel you know he is that crus
[41:51] of salt that in lies ahead he is that
[41:53] vessel that out of him that was poured
[41:56] out that life after he ascended to the
[41:59] me tutorial see he poured out his life
[42:01] into empty vessels that were gathered
[42:04] there in the upper room and then Peter
[42:06] under the unction the Holy Spirit he
[42:08] himself stands there that day and says
[42:10] that this is unto your children and to
[42:14] them that's afar off and as many as
[42:16] the Lord our God shall call you know
[42:18] what he was saying gather many vessels
[42:20] how many vessels don't gather a few
[42:23] gather many vessels you see it was not a
[42:26] limit on it it's God knows and God there
[42:30] was a number of vessels but God knew
[42:32] that number and how would be brought
[42:34] together in this hour that these vessels
[42:36] would be full and yet after being full
[42:39] the oil still stayed I tell you what a
[42:42] testimony of God's own life of the Holy
[42:45] Spirit it's still the same it's still
[42:49] all sufficient power it's still more
[42:51] than enough it's still the same God in
[42:54] this hour as he was there in the very
[42:57] beginning he still he's still pouring
[43:00] out of his spirit in vessels that will
[43:02] present themselves empty Omaha to think
[43:06] of this the oil itself it's stayed now
[43:09] watch watch this here the Bible says in
[43:11] verse 7 that when she came and she told
[43:13] the man of God now she's done what what
[43:16] was what was expected or what was spoken
[43:19] to her and she told the man of God you
[43:21] see sometimes when we look at this here
[43:23] you'll find things that where God will
[43:26] open things to us and then we walk in
[43:28] obedience and then God will open more as
[43:31] we're walking we walk a little bit then
[43:33] God opens a more you know God doesn't
[43:36] lay out the whole whole program to us
[43:39] but God unveils these things just as we
[43:42] have need oven to think of it she goes
[43:45] on he says to her go sell the oil and
[43:48] pay that debt and live thou and that
[43:51] children of the rest now think of this
[43:55] what she already had in her possession
[43:59] was more than enough are you with me she
[44:05] had more than enough there was vessels
[44:08] they gathered vessels and yet after
[44:10] filling up all these vessels the oil
[44:13] still stayed there was more than enough
[44:17] it wasn't just enough it was more than
[44:21] enough because she not only had enough
[44:23] to be able to sell and pay the debt
[44:26] think of this if he would have told her
[44:28] in the beginning this
[44:29] time you're gonna get out of this you're
[44:30] gonna get out of it by the oil but she
[44:32] would have never seen it that way but
[44:35] you see if she kept on walking
[44:36] faith is building as she's obedient to
[44:39] the word faith is being built and she
[44:41] comes into this place she sells the oil
[44:44] and pays off the debt and then the rest
[44:46] of the oil what's left live off of that
[44:49] I'm grateful that how bet the token of
[44:51] the Holy Spirit that great oil of God it
[44:54] is a signification that we were
[44:57] identified in the purchase price of
[45:00] Calvary and it is an identification that
[45:03] we were included there and that the sin
[45:07] question in our life has been settled
[45:09] you know brother Baron said it like this
[45:11] he said in a message all things he said
[45:13] you know it Calvary was not a wholesale
[45:15] affair to the believer it's not a
[45:17] wholesale affair but it is something
[45:19] that is personal were you and I can look
[45:22] at and say for my iniquities
[45:24] it was for my he bought for my healing
[45:27] it was for my sins it was for my
[45:30] transgression you see it's personal and
[45:33] we recognize that that even that oil
[45:36] she lived of that oil the rest of the
[45:39] days I tell you there was never a want
[45:41] in that house when there was a need that
[45:43] was there they lived of that oil I tell
[45:46] you the truth tonight in real reality
[45:47] for us we're not living by anything else
[45:51] other than by the oil of Almighty God
[45:54] it's God that's given us strength day in
[45:56] and day out my brother and sister he
[45:58] might be you that can sit down and we
[46:00] can open the lids of the Bible but we
[46:02] cannot give ourselves strength we can
[46:04] listen to the message of the hour but we
[46:06] cannot give ourselves strength it takes
[46:08] Almighty God to feel you and I it takes
[46:12] him to give strength and nourishment oz
[46:14] and minister to the needs it don't
[46:16] matter what comes up the oil has stayed
[46:20] she already had what she needed she
[46:26] already had it she had what was needed
[46:30] to pay off the debt a need arose but
[46:34] what it is is now she comes to that
[46:37] place and that realization and God makes
[46:39] it real
[46:40] it's more than enough now look at this
[46:44] here in the scripture just a few places
[46:47] in the scripture to think of how that
[46:49] God would place it here
[46:52] even when manna would rain down on the
[46:53] ground and I'm just going to just refer
[46:55] to this very briefly even when God would
[46:59] rain down manna for the children of
[47:01] Israel to eat thereof you know there was
[47:04] not just enough there was more than
[47:09] enough there was more than enough the
[47:13] Bible says every man was together
[47:15] according to his eating very much
[47:17] somebody that gathered a lot and other
[47:19] someone else together much less they
[47:22] weren't running and racing and like
[47:25] trying to get the last piece of pizza I
[47:27] know that's simple but we get the point
[47:30] or the last pork chop or whatever on the
[47:33] plate there was more than enough there
[47:35] wasn't racing around to get it
[47:37] it was covering the ground and you know
[47:40] a man is the type of manna is a type of
[47:42] the oil of God of the Holy Spirit there
[47:46] was plenty of manna that have fallen and
[47:49] there was there was more than enough as
[47:52] a matter of fact the Bible tell them
[47:53] don't even hang on to what you've picked
[47:56] up until the next morning but when you
[47:58] have finished eating burn that and put
[48:01] that away so there was more than enough
[48:04] when God would supply not just enough
[48:07] but there was more than enough I think
[48:09] of this here in the book you know in the
[48:11] book of Exodus chapter 12 when it speaks
[48:14] here concerning Israel when the Israel
[48:17] was coming out of the land here and as
[48:19] they were journeying you know Moses had
[48:22] told them under the direction of the
[48:23] Lord in Exodus 12 35 he told the
[48:26] children of Israel how they were to
[48:28] borrow of the Egyptians jewels of silver
[48:31] jewels of gold and raiment you see God
[48:34] knew what was needed there the Bible now
[48:37] wants you to catch this the Bible the
[48:38] word says borrow and it means ask you
[48:41] see it and when God wanted it to be
[48:43] released to them you see in reality the
[48:46] Egyptians were holding it but it really
[48:48] belonged to the Lord because the Bible
[48:50] says the earth is the
[48:51] Lord's and the fullness thereof they
[48:53] were holding it come on now it's just
[48:56] like the earth is right now but the
[48:58] precious metals in gold and everyone
[49:00] I've met it can be helped but you know
[49:02] what when when we you and I when we come
[49:04] back here upon this earth in the
[49:05] Millennium here and then in the future
[49:07] home here to see everything itself it
[49:10] belongs to the Lord and so here they ask
[49:13] and they borrow now when you know to
[49:15] think about it they're walking out of
[49:17] here and the Bible says in verse 36 that
[49:20] the Lord gave the people favor in the
[49:22] sight of the Egyptians who gave them
[49:24] favor God did who was it that they
[49:28] didn't have to fight for this they just
[49:29] had to say oh we need raiment we need
[49:32] silver we need gold think of this now
[49:34] these were people who had been in mud
[49:36] pits these were people who had been they
[49:39] they were known these are slaves and
[49:42] they're talking to the Egyptians give us
[49:45] the silver give us of gold give us of
[49:48] raiment you see it was already it was
[49:50] God who gave them favor in order to
[49:54] receive these things God knew they would
[49:55] have need of it is that right so the
[49:59] Bible says so they lent unto them such
[50:02] things as they required and they spoiled
[50:04] the Egyptians you know one thing that we
[50:07] find here that even within among the
[50:09] Israel they didn't know what all this
[50:12] meant they didn't know that there was a
[50:15] vision that was going to break forth and
[50:17] that there was going to be these
[50:18] different things that would be required
[50:20] the tabernacle of God was going to come
[50:23] forth there they didn't know that they
[50:25] did not know the things that they were
[50:27] going to encounter in the journey but
[50:29] all they knew is is go ahead and ask for
[50:32] these things because it's going to be
[50:34] needed you see God Himself splitting
[50:37] such a principle before you and I seek
[50:40] you first the kingdom of God and His
[50:42] righteousness and all these other things
[50:44] will be added unto us God already knew
[50:46] what they was going to have need of he
[50:49] already knew they didn't know but all
[50:51] they did was do what was told them to do
[50:56] oma in that a blessing that's a blessing
[50:59] just to be simple enough not to ask God
[51:02] to come down and explain it because he
[51:04] won't
[51:04] but it's just blessing to say Lord I
[51:06] take you at your word they didn't ask
[51:09] questions why do you want us to go do
[51:11] this why do you want us to ask of them
[51:13] they did not ask that but maybe they
[51:15] took that this is the word of the Lord
[51:17] not Moses suggestion this is the word of
[51:19] the Lord then to think of this the
[51:21] riches of the Egyptians here placed in
[51:24] their hand you know the Bible says it
[51:26] like this in Exodus 36 when they're
[51:28] taking an offering after after Israel
[51:31] has come back in line with God after the
[51:33] molten calf and and things and here they
[51:35] are walking with the Lord and it begins
[51:38] to break the vision now and things begin
[51:40] to transpire and the men whom God has
[51:43] skilled to bring forth that vision there
[51:45] that God has given Moses the Bible says
[51:48] that how that the people were to bring
[51:50] offerings there unto the tabernacle
[51:52] every morning is that right not to think
[51:56] of this the people themselves were
[51:58] slaves how could they bring an offering
[52:02] but you see what they were doing they
[52:05] were presenting what God had given to
[52:07] them and what God gave to them he
[52:10] entrusted to them that they in turn are
[52:13] recognizing his presence there and they
[52:16] entrust it back to the Lord and God
[52:19] turns around and God blesses them you
[52:21] know when you look at it for our lives
[52:23] when God would lay the principle in our
[52:25] life it's him that provides for you and
[52:28] I and then we turn around and honor him
[52:31] and presenting to him our tithes and
[52:33] offerings and he turns around and
[52:35] blesses us for honoring him and
[52:37] recognizing the Lord I would have
[52:39] nothing if it wasn't for you oh my and
[52:45] to think of that are we worthy we're not
[52:47] worthy of it because it's been him that
[52:49] has provided all things for us then to
[52:52] see the Bible goes on to say in Exodus
[52:54] 36 as they continued to bring every
[52:57] morning they eventually the men rose up
[52:59] and they told him in verse 5 they told
[53:01] Moses the people bring much more than
[53:05] enough for the service of the work which
[53:08] the LORD commanded to make and so the
[53:11] Bible says they calls the people there
[53:13] and restrained the people from bringing
[53:15] any more offering
[53:18] more than enough there was more not just
[53:23] enough not just barely making it you see
[53:27] the principle we're not just going to
[53:29] barely make it we're not just going to
[53:32] Oh barely make it in the rapture we're
[53:35] not just barely living from day to day
[53:38] oh I'm just barely gonna make it to next
[53:40] week no you're not you have more than
[53:44] enough it's recognizing what you already
[53:48] have that God has given you when God has
[53:52] placed his life his oil his substance
[53:56] into your life you have more than enough
[54:00] we're not just barely gonna make it it's
[54:03] not just enough they were not standing
[54:06] there at the tabernacle door and saying
[54:08] oh please please can you tell somebody
[54:10] how about you bring five and you bring
[54:12] ten how about let's just make pledges
[54:14] and helmet they didn't do none of that
[54:16] they had to tell them stop bringing
[54:19] don't bring no more we've got more than
[54:23] enough the Bible says in verse 7 for the
[54:26] stuff they had was sufficient for all
[54:29] the work to make it and to much more
[54:34] than enough God knew what was going to
[54:40] be needed you see I believe that we can
[54:42] testify here tonight he's a faithful
[54:46] provider he's a faithful provider I
[54:55] don't know how you I don't know how
[54:57] you've been but I'll just testify a
[54:58] little bit I can remember some of the
[55:01] first few years we got married and where
[55:02] you had to put things out of the
[55:03] shopping cart and put it back I can
[55:07] remember that getting up to there to the
[55:10] to the line and trusting what you had in
[55:12] the car cause you know you got house
[55:14] payment and everything else is there but
[55:16] you know what the kingdom of God is
[55:18] first that was first there was no
[55:21] compromise on that but there's things in
[55:24] when you look back on it I look back in
[55:26] those times and my wife we talked about
[55:28] it many times I look back on that I look
[55:30] back in those mom
[55:32] I think God for those times it makes you
[55:35] appreciative it lets you know that it
[55:38] was God all along that was taken care of
[55:41] you God seemed to it we weren't for what
[55:44] I mean I didn't waste away to a
[55:46] skinflint
[55:47] you with me but you see within it all
[55:50] there were things God is a faithful
[55:53] provider I look at it here for this
[55:57] building here when we came over here to
[56:00] take there to to begin to look at this
[56:02] building
[56:03] you all remember here we were we had
[56:05] bought a lot of property or a lot a
[56:07] piece of property and they wouldn't let
[56:09] us build in that area but yet then after
[56:12] this coming into this place here in July
[56:14] of 97 you remember how that at that time
[56:17] you know it was mentioned you know of
[56:20] what we could have we came over here and
[56:22] we came in and said in this place how
[56:24] many of you remember that just within a
[56:26] month's time that there was over 30
[56:28] thousand dollars that came in to go with
[56:32] what was already here it wasn't that we
[56:34] got a surplus of people it's that people
[56:37] caught the vision of what can be mine
[56:40] and it happened I'll never forget that
[56:43] I've given that testimony to many other
[56:46] Assemblies there that different ones
[56:48] that might still be written and they've
[56:50] asked me certain questions I've told
[56:52] them I said I've witnessed how God can
[56:54] take little and he'll multiply I
[56:56] remember that when we were renting the
[56:59] building and you know that's all we were
[57:00] doing is renting a building it was like
[57:02] no vision was there to go on and go as
[57:05] far as to obtain a building everything
[57:07] seemed impossible and I'm just gonna
[57:09] preach tonight a little bit you remember
[57:11] the different naysayers and things like
[57:13] that oh it's too much and we're not able
[57:15] to do it and we're not but let me tell
[57:17] you something when God's in control God
[57:20] is more than any naysayer he's bigger
[57:23] than anyone looking at we can put this
[57:25] together I can't put this together
[57:27] I'm telling you brother and sister I
[57:29] have two senses all right but we need to
[57:31] go let our two cents being the change
[57:33] aura of God's holy will because it's
[57:36] what does God say about these things if
[57:38] we looked at it naturally I could agree
[57:40] it look like that it was
[57:42] more than what we could do but to think
[57:45] of how God in His mercy here within just
[57:48] what was at less than seven years the
[57:50] building the property itself was paid
[57:52] off a hundred and eighty thousand
[57:54] dollars was already paid off say brother
[57:57] Samuel are you preaching money you're
[57:58] missing the point tonight what I'm
[58:00] trying to tell you is little is much
[58:03] when God is in it that's all it takes
[58:06] you see what would you begin to look for
[58:09] you don't need a buddy who's a
[58:10] millionaire you don't need somebody
[58:12] who's rich
[58:13] you know Abraham he realized he could
[58:15] have had whatever he wanted
[58:17] but Abraham told the king of Sodom he
[58:19] said I don't even want a shoe latch it
[58:20] from you because lest you say you made
[58:24] Abraham rich I don't want none of your
[58:26] riches he said but is he saying I'm
[58:28] depending on the Lord who is possessor
[58:31] of heaven and earth Abraham knew what he
[58:35] had right then now you might look at
[58:38] Abraham and I could look at Abraham you
[58:40] say well in that chapter brother Samuel
[58:42] Abraham was still you know he was in a
[58:44] sanctification chapter but look what he
[58:46] had in a sanctification chapter because
[58:49] abandon don't just leave that as a
[58:51] sanctification chapter we follow the
[58:53] types as it runs in certain areas but to
[58:55] think of what he had he had enough to
[58:57] know that God has brought me out here
[59:00] he opened a lamb that he said he would
[59:02] open and show to me he has provided for
[59:04] me and so I'm going to rest in him I'm
[59:07] not going to trust in flesh every time
[59:10] Israel got in trouble they started
[59:12] thinking about Egypt I'm not just
[59:13] talking about in the journey here I'm
[59:15] talking about when they got in the land
[59:16] they started thinking about Egypt
[59:18] started looking at their chariots
[59:19] started looking at Syria but you know
[59:21] what God would allow situations to arise
[59:23] they never had to look at those things
[59:25] as long as they honored the Living God
[59:28] who provided for him what they had need
[59:31] of never had to look for that this is
[59:34] where God is a faithful provider I'm
[59:37] glad about that aren't you he knows just
[59:40] what we have need of his children were
[59:44] not beggars David said it like this in
[59:48] psalms 37:25 I have been young and now
[59:50] I'm old
[59:51] yet have I not seen the righteous
[59:54] forsaken nor his seed begging bread hmm
[1:00:01] Psalms 105 37 since he brought them
[1:00:05] forth also with silver and gold and
[1:00:08] there was not one feeble person among
[1:00:10] their tribes in Deuteronomy chapter 2
[1:00:15] this is where I just just so impressed
[1:00:17] upon my heart it was not known that they
[1:00:22] were going to be 40 years in the
[1:00:23] wilderness when they left Egypt Moses
[1:00:28] didn't know they were going to be 40
[1:00:29] years in the wilderness when they left
[1:00:31] Egypt it was afterwards that God made it
[1:00:35] known when they rebelled is that right
[1:00:40] but God knew God knew he made a promise
[1:00:44] and a seed is going to come in in here
[1:00:46] at that land God knew that out of all of
[1:00:50] that multitude there's a seed that's
[1:00:52] going to come forth and inherit that
[1:00:53] land and God provided sufficient what
[1:00:57] was needed in order for them to come
[1:01:00] into that place amen the Bible says it
[1:01:03] like this in Deuteronomy chapter 2 verse
[1:01:06] 6 ye shall buy meat of them for money I
[1:01:09] want you to watch this all through this
[1:01:11] chapter here in Deuteronomy - God tells
[1:01:14] them I don't want you meddling with them
[1:01:15] you go on back Esau you gone by the rest
[1:01:19] of them they got their inheritance that
[1:01:21] I gave them in other words God said
[1:01:24] don't you act like a bully
[1:01:25] you don't gotta go take nothing you have
[1:01:29] what you need when you come through
[1:01:31] their land you tell them I'll buy the
[1:01:34] grass I'll buy the water where did they
[1:01:38] get the money God provided God knew what
[1:01:42] they'd have needeth and God wasn't up
[1:01:44] there he didn't ask them to calculate
[1:01:46] how much grass they was gonna eat he did
[1:01:49] not hash them to calculate how much meat
[1:01:51] and how much water he didn't ask them
[1:01:53] for that they didn't have to think about
[1:01:55] that are you with me now that's where
[1:01:57] the Lord Jesus could say we're in
[1:01:59] addressing the anxiousness of the
[1:02:01] humanity and say take no thought for
[1:02:03] tomorrow
[1:02:05] Morrow shot care for itself you know any
[1:02:09] friends we're not talking about that
[1:02:10] you're not a good steward that's not
[1:02:12] what I'm saying at all but sometimes I
[1:02:14] think we get so much faith in our
[1:02:16] stewardship instead of having faith in
[1:02:19] the Living God is to have faith in Him
[1:02:23] don't rest upon your retirement of your
[1:02:25] 401 K or I got so much here in the bank
[1:02:28] that I'll not be on rest I rest should
[1:02:31] be in the Lord we do under his
[1:02:35] leadership ask him to help us to guide
[1:02:37] us to show us to direct us but our rest
[1:02:40] is in him he knows what we have need of
[1:02:44] he's more than enough I'll tell you this
[1:02:50] right here tonight you realize that if
[1:02:52] you needed a loaf of bread if you've got
[1:02:55] the 50 cents or whatever the loaf of
[1:02:57] bread cost you realize you got
[1:02:59] purchasing power you may not have the
[1:03:02] bread but you're as good as got it
[1:03:04] because you got the purchasing power you
[1:03:06] see they had purchasing power God made
[1:03:09] sure they had purchasing power and
[1:03:12] you've got purchasing power tonight for
[1:03:15] what you have need of in your life you
[1:03:18] got purchasing power but something I
[1:03:20] don't feel like I have faith or I don't
[1:03:22] feel like I've got that much faith don't
[1:03:23] even testify to that but to testify to
[1:03:28] that purchasing power that God has
[1:03:30] placed within you you see God knew a
[1:03:33] need would arise he knew a situation
[1:03:35] would come up and you see God allows
[1:03:37] that need and that situation to come up
[1:03:40] in your life or in my life that God
[1:03:42] might prove himself in our lives I'm
[1:03:46] glad that I can look back on my life and
[1:03:49] I'm there's no way that I can look back
[1:03:51] and take credit for it aren't you glad
[1:03:53] there's no way that I can look back on
[1:03:55] it you say what about that bachelor's
[1:03:57] degree in masters degree and those
[1:03:58] things hanging on the wall I don't take
[1:04:00] one bit of credit for that
[1:04:01] I look to God God gave me the abilities
[1:04:05] to be able to do that I don't look back
[1:04:08] from that this is what I was able to do
[1:04:10] it's what God in His grace has been able
[1:04:12] to bring us through friends the tests
[1:04:15] the trials those things that come our
[1:04:17] way it's God's
[1:04:19] that's provided to you and I more than
[1:04:22] enough
[1:04:34] hmm
[1:04:36] you shall buy meat of them for money
[1:04:38] that you may eat and you shall also buy
[1:04:41] water of them for money that you may
[1:04:44] drink for the LORD thy God hath blessed
[1:04:46] thee and all that works of thy hand he
[1:04:48] knoweth by walking through this great
[1:04:50] wilderness look at this these forty
[1:04:53] years
[1:04:53] the LORD thy God hath been with thee
[1:04:56] thou hath lacked nothing
[1:05:02] why did you like nothing because he's
[1:05:05] been with you that's what makes the
[1:05:09] difference you could have everything and
[1:05:12] yet have nothing but if you have him
[1:05:15] you have everything amen they that fear
[1:05:21] the Lord shall not want
[1:05:23] you know David came to that realization
[1:05:25] the Lord is my shepherd David when that
[1:05:28] revelation broke on his heart it was it
[1:05:31] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:05:33] he is he knows every pasture he knows
[1:05:38] just what I have need of when I have
[1:05:41] need of it he knows the circumstances of
[1:05:43] life I tell you friends tests and trials
[1:05:47] are predestined they are predestinated
[1:05:50] appointments by God for each of our life
[1:05:53] that there might be a reducing of us
[1:05:56] that it might be an increasing of him
[1:05:59] it's all for his glory and all of those
[1:06:04] things to show Lord I need you
[1:06:12] we're not beggars
[1:06:13] can you say man no where in the
[1:06:16] scripture does it place us as beggars
[1:06:19] but were to ask ask you know God God let
[1:06:27] him walk here for forty years I want you
[1:06:29] to think of this I know there's a lot of
[1:06:32] there was a lot of testimonies there was
[1:06:33] a lot of things being built to build
[1:06:36] their faith but you know there was
[1:06:38] something right next to him that they
[1:06:42] put on every morning and it was a
[1:06:45] miracle
[1:06:46] every morning when they put on their
[1:06:49] garments
[1:06:50] and they put on their shoes they were
[1:06:53] reminded 40 years never worn out you
[1:07:02] can't tell me they had better material
[1:07:07] who kept that together God did they
[1:07:11] needed clothes and God clothe them
[1:07:13] that's why Jesus could say if he closed
[1:07:16] the grass the field would grass if he
[1:07:18] takes care of the birds and provided
[1:07:21] straw for their nests isn't he much more
[1:07:24] and even knowing the hairs of your head
[1:07:26] he already knows what you have need of
[1:07:29] you see God did not want their focus to
[1:07:33] be taken away from anything but me
[1:07:36] rather be focused on the promise and
[1:07:38] that's God's desire when when God let me
[1:07:42] tell you like this when God provides for
[1:07:44] you and I as God provides God will never
[1:07:46] place in our hands
[1:07:49] something that would trouble us or
[1:07:51] hinder us God will not do that God will
[1:07:56] not do place in our hands something that
[1:07:58] would cause us to fail because if he
[1:08:01] does that he's an author of confusion
[1:08:03] and frustration but he's the author of
[1:08:06] peace when God places something in our
[1:08:10] hands whether it's a job or whether it's
[1:08:11] this and it might seem overarching to us
[1:08:14] but it's a time to look to him and say
[1:08:18] Lord this is a door that you opened
[1:08:20] maybe I don't feel fit for it
[1:08:23] I don't feel sufficient for it but
[1:08:25] you've opened this door and I'm gonna
[1:08:27] step through this Lord and as you opened
[1:08:29] it Lord I'm trusting in your grace Lord
[1:08:31] for where I'm standing your grace there
[1:08:34] to keep me to lead me and to guide me
[1:08:37] let me tell you Keane running out of
[1:08:40] grease he ain't running out of mercy as
[1:08:42] a matter of fact even as you look even
[1:08:44] those that were removed from the journey
[1:08:46] of Israel they could look back in that
[1:08:48] time and Nehemiah
[1:08:50] under the inspiration of God and
[1:08:52] Nehemiah 9 would say thou manifold mercy
[1:08:55] so God that was made known to the
[1:08:57] children of Israel God continues to
[1:08:59] unfold himself day in and day out I'll
[1:09:01] tell you what even when
[1:09:02] you think you don't need mercy you need
[1:09:04] mercy more than than you ever did
[1:09:06] we need the mercy and grace of Almighty
[1:09:08] God mercy is not just its it's not just
[1:09:11] God you know keep him from us what we
[1:09:13] deserve but friends every one of us no
[1:09:16] matter where we stand we need the mercy
[1:09:18] of Almighty God we need his correction
[1:09:21] we need his leadership we need leered
[1:09:23] the administering of his love and His
[1:09:26] grace to our lives we need that and God
[1:09:30] is more than enough see everyday they
[1:09:38] could say where's the miracle ain't seen
[1:09:41] no mere look right up next to you you're
[1:09:48] here in your right mind you're a miracle
[1:09:50] in this age that we're living in where
[1:09:56] it is infiltrated with demonic influence
[1:09:59] that lids been ticking off of hell it's
[1:10:01] all around us you don't have to go down
[1:10:05] on Skid Row you can go down on you can
[1:10:09] go down in the highest street there is
[1:10:11] it's there it's all around but to thank
[1:10:16] God that within your heart that you've
[1:10:19] got a heart to serve God a desire a
[1:10:21] pulsation that beats within your heart
[1:10:24] to please God I'll tell you that's a
[1:10:26] greatest treasure there is in this world
[1:10:28] it's more than anything else and to have
[1:10:32] our right mind in this hour sometimes we
[1:10:41] look too hard and these are the things
[1:10:42] that God has placed right around us more
[1:10:46] than enough but Simon how did their
[1:10:49] raiment not wax old God how did their
[1:10:54] feet not swell the Lord that's it
[1:11:02] it was God providing for them he is
[1:11:07] sufficient let me bring this down here
[1:11:20] examples in the scripture remember in
[1:11:24] the Lord Jesus
[1:11:25] there's malt there's there's multiple
[1:11:28] accounts but when the Lord Jesus looked
[1:11:33] upon the multitude that was following
[1:11:36] him Matthew 14 the Bible says he was
[1:11:39] moved with compassion and he looked upon
[1:11:41] him and he seen they were hungry and he
[1:11:44] told the disciples we cannot send them
[1:11:46] away hungry he said what do we have here
[1:11:51] they brought to him what was had you see
[1:11:57] he asked what's here they gave him what
[1:12:01] was there he took what was there and he
[1:12:05] multiplied what was there to meet the
[1:12:09] need and they it wasn't just enough the
[1:12:13] Bible says in Matthew 14 20 day all did
[1:12:18] eat and were filled and they took up the
[1:12:21] fragments that remained twelve baskets
[1:12:24] full not just enough more than enough
[1:12:29] God got ahold of it it wasn't just
[1:12:32] enough it was more than enough the Bible
[1:12:38] goes on in the next account in a very
[1:12:39] next chapter it goes into the seagulls
[1:12:42] into you know here's another situation
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:46] multitudes are there
[1:12:49] Jesus has moved with compassion aren't
[1:12:52] you glad that he's moved with compassion
[1:12:54] aren't you glad that he doesn't look to
[1:12:56] you and I'd say come on come on I mean
[1:13:00] come on man throw it up you know come on
[1:13:03] aren't you glad that he looks deep
[1:13:06] aren't you glad he sees the need and
[1:13:10] don't try to spiritualize all this
[1:13:11] there's a spiritual part to it but it
[1:13:14] also Jesus was looking there and see
[1:13:16] they had a physical need to be fed they
[1:13:22] were hungry come on somebody this is
[1:13:27] where John picks up the inspiration and
[1:13:29] said let us not love just in word or
[1:13:31] deed
[1:13:33] all right he said in James tells us
[1:13:36] don't just look up on somebody and they
[1:13:38] say they got a need and you say before
[1:13:40] my brother god bless you go on your way
[1:13:42] no he said when it's with you and in
[1:13:45] your power to do do it whoo this is what
[1:13:51] he did he took consideration aren't you
[1:13:55] glad Blizzard friends he we needed
[1:13:58] what's the greatest thing that we had
[1:14:00] need of is our souls the Bible says man
[1:14:03] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:14:05] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:14:06] mouth of God but we do need natural
[1:14:08] bread and God knows we need natural
[1:14:11] bread we need spiritual bread while
[1:14:15] we're here in this life do we thank God
[1:14:17] for the revelation of his word we thank
[1:14:19] God for the unfolding of his word but
[1:14:22] you know there's still a natural man
[1:14:23] that has to be fed and has to be cared
[1:14:26] for
[1:14:27] you see Jesus was not moving so walking
[1:14:30] in the clouds that he forgot about that
[1:14:32] there were needs within the natural body
[1:14:35] come on somebody Paul even brought this
[1:14:38] up over here in breach into the church
[1:14:40] and letting the church know don't be and
[1:14:42] so out here that you don't take account
[1:14:44] of the needs that are among you Jesus
[1:14:47] the Bible says was moved with compassion
[1:14:49] when he solved they were hungry and they
[1:14:52] asked again what is here they brought in
[1:14:55] the bread brought him to fish the Bible
[1:14:58] says in Matthew 15 37 and they all did
[1:15:01] eat and were filled and they took up of
[1:15:03] the broken meat that was left seven
[1:15:06] baskets full not just enough more than
[1:15:12] enough God let this be known for our
[1:15:17] life that he is more than enough the oil
[1:15:22] that's already with those born of the
[1:15:25] Spirit of God already happened that you
[1:15:28] have what you have need of in your life
[1:15:30] you might look and say well how is that
[1:15:32] oil you're gonna pay my bill but you see
[1:15:35] what it is it's you submitting to the
[1:15:37] Lord and say Lord take control of my
[1:15:39] emotions Lord take control Lord in my
[1:15:41] faults I give my mind they give my
[1:15:43] faults I give my feelings I give it to
[1:15:45] you lord
[1:15:46] and this is what you've said in your
[1:15:47] work concerning me if there never was
[1:15:50] any other Mortal upon the face of the
[1:15:52] earth this is your word I'm your son I
[1:15:54] am your daughter Lord and I come to you
[1:15:57] in faith asking Lord God as you said in
[1:16:00] your word ask and you shall receive
[1:16:02] there's a need Lord God in my life I
[1:16:05] need in a situation and I believe that
[1:16:08] you are more than enough it wasn't just
[1:16:11] enough to take me out of the world not
[1:16:13] just enough to take the world out of me
[1:16:15] not just enough to fill me up but he's
[1:16:18] been more than enough he's been there to
[1:16:21] strengthen me when I've been in my
[1:16:22] lowest he's been there to pick me up
[1:16:24] when I fall him down
[1:16:26] he's been there to give me strength and
[1:16:28] to give me grace and to give me faith
[1:16:30] when I had need of it it's been more
[1:16:33] than enough when you and I started our
[1:16:35] journey we did not know all of the
[1:16:37] things that would come our way
[1:16:38] everything every test every trial every
[1:16:41] mistake every failure but all along the
[1:16:44] way God has proven himself that he's
[1:16:46] more than enough it's not just enough
[1:16:49] he's more than enough more than enough
[1:16:54] and God was letting Israel know I'm more
[1:16:57] than enough you haven't laughed one
[1:17:00] single thing while you've been out here
[1:17:01] 40 years you didn't plan on it you
[1:17:04] didn't see it but when I asked you to
[1:17:06] borrow from those Egyptians and that to
[1:17:08] be released I know there would be a need
[1:17:10] of it and what was given was more than
[1:17:13] enough more than enough I'm grateful to
[1:17:18] God aren't you no wonder Paul could
[1:17:21] stand up and Paul could say I know how
[1:17:23] to be you know a based I know how to be
[1:17:26] you know where I'm in walk but yet be
[1:17:28] content I know Paul said and he goes on
[1:17:31] to tell the people of God that my God
[1:17:33] shall supply according to all your needs
[1:17:36] according to his riches and glory I'm
[1:17:39] glad about that tonight these are
[1:17:42] promises that belong to you and I more
[1:17:45] than enough for us aren't you glad you
[1:17:51] know brother Graham tells us about those
[1:17:52] little trees he tells us about you know
[1:17:55] how a tree it's got every Apple and
[1:17:58] every leaf in it
[1:18:01] everyone's in it all it has to do is
[1:18:04] drink and actually drink more than its
[1:18:08] portion and then it pushes out limbs
[1:18:12] pushes out you know leaves pushes out
[1:18:15] apples and brother Brown was it just
[1:18:17] says it like this you know so simple he
[1:18:20] says that's the way a Christian is we're
[1:18:23] planted together in Christ Jesus who is
[1:18:26] the inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:18:28] we're planted in Christ we just drink
[1:18:31] and drink and drink and push out
[1:18:32] everything we have nita for our earthly
[1:18:34] journey divine healing the power of God
[1:18:37] and all these other things is in every
[1:18:39] individual in here that's received a
[1:18:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost for your
[1:18:44] planet in Christ the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:18:46] yes sir what you have Nita for this
[1:18:50] life's journey even the rapture is in
[1:18:53] you right then he says don't resent that
[1:18:59] that's the truth the rapture is in us
[1:19:03] now he said I can prove it by the gospel
[1:19:08] those who he called he justified those
[1:19:11] he justified
[1:19:12] he's already glorified he says Oh
[1:19:15] hallelujah then in heaven today were a
[1:19:18] glorified in the presence of God right
[1:19:20] now I'm just pushing out to it glory
[1:19:24] God's in his word over and over you hear
[1:19:31] brother Ben we'll take that part of the
[1:19:33] inexhaustible fountain of God brother
[1:19:36] Bama will dramatize it a little fish
[1:19:38] he's taking imagine a little fish out
[1:19:40] here in the lake or in the ocean
[1:19:41] I better not drink too much water I
[1:19:43] might drink it all up Robinson can you
[1:19:47] imagine a little mouse that's there in
[1:19:49] Egypt underneath the Garner's during the
[1:19:51] time of Joseph
[1:19:52] I better ration out this green I may not
[1:19:56] be able you know there may not be enough
[1:19:58] though Graham said there was more than
[1:20:00] enough if you live thousands of years
[1:20:02] but I'm still like this he said there's
[1:20:04] more of the blessings of God he said it
[1:20:07] God will still be pouring out of his
[1:20:08] blessings you cannot exhaust
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:21] the oil is sufficient more than enough
[1:20:27] he's our stabilizer there's nothing
[1:20:30] these vessels can say well I did this
[1:20:32] the glory was not the vessel the vessel
[1:20:35] is not what paid off the debt come on
[1:20:38] somebody
[1:20:39] he said go get empty vessels and put oil
[1:20:41] in it and then go sell the oil you had
[1:20:44] to have vessels that could hold the oil
[1:20:46] so it's not about the vessels it's the
[1:20:49] oil in it it's not any value that we can
[1:20:53] glory in ourselves there's no glory in
[1:20:57] ourselves but the glory is the
[1:21:00] excellency of his power in earthen
[1:21:03] vessels it's the oil that's in these
[1:21:07] frail human vessels that's the glory of
[1:21:12] God not the vessel the glory of God the
[1:21:16] oil of God that's on the inside and a
[1:21:21] fire that's burning to show there's all
[1:21:24] hell down there in that lamp there's oil
[1:21:28] in that lamp oh there's more than enough
[1:21:30] more than enough aren't you glad there's
[1:21:34] more than enough God knows exactly what
[1:21:38] we would have need of he knows what your
[1:21:40] need is tonight
[1:21:41] he knows he's more than enough you can
[1:21:45] take that that an example in that
[1:21:47] testimony and you can just rest within
[1:21:50] that knowing you're not a beggar you're
[1:21:54] a son and daughter of God amen
[1:21:58] you have redemptive rights and he wants
[1:22:01] you to use those redemptive rights you
[1:22:03] think you think what it does to our
[1:22:05] Heavenly Father when you and I would
[1:22:08] come to him and we say Lord Jesus
[1:22:10] there's a need right here Lord and
[1:22:13] father we're looking to you if we
[1:22:15] believe it's already a finished work
[1:22:17] think what that does to Papa when he
[1:22:20] hears faith coming forth like that let
[1:22:22] me tell you something it's so turned his
[1:22:24] heart when
[1:22:25] was a Roman centurion that day that
[1:22:27] could rise in that place and say I don't
[1:22:30] need you to come to my house but you
[1:22:31] just say the word and he'll be healed he
[1:22:34] said what faith what faith is this I've
[1:22:38] not found faith like this within Israel
[1:22:40] you see what it was
[1:22:41] he recognized who was there what it does
[1:22:46] to our Heavenly Father when we can just
[1:22:49] by faith recognize and come before him
[1:22:52] and ask let our petitions be known
[1:22:56] we're not begging we're asking amen
[1:23:01] because we are his sons and daughters by
[1:23:05] His redemptive grace by the blood that's
[1:23:08] been shed and the life within that blood
[1:23:10] that's been poured out and has brought
[1:23:12] you and I back to this place to be
[1:23:15] manifested sons and daughters of God oh
[1:23:18] my we're not beggars we're sons and
[1:23:23] daughters of God whatever it is there's
[1:23:29] nothing - you could say minuscule
[1:23:32] there's nothing - little as a matter of
[1:23:35] fact brother Bentham said it like this
[1:23:38] he said God wants you to ask for big
[1:23:41] things
[1:23:43] matter of fact brother Bram goes saying
[1:23:46] that same quote he says what I'm doing
[1:23:48] right now he said I'm asking God for
[1:23:49] thousands of souls in this meeting come
[1:23:54] on friends he said God wants us to ask
[1:23:57] big things why are we asking like we're
[1:24:01] just dealing with a little saucer a
[1:24:03] little teacup he's not just a saucer or
[1:24:05] a teacup hey men that's the devil's lied
[1:24:08] that he just wants to trickle out in
[1:24:10] this out that's a lie it's not a
[1:24:12] trickling in this hour there is a
[1:24:14] fullness there is a fountain for you and
[1:24:17] I that's open in the house of David the
[1:24:20] Jews will come to that realization in
[1:24:23] their hour but you and I have the
[1:24:25] realization in this hour
[1:24:27] it's the inexhaustible fountain of
[1:24:29] Almighty God amen we're living in his
[1:24:32] presence amen that's why I believe that
[1:24:36] we can expect and
[1:24:38] living in his presence then we can
[1:24:39] expect all things hallelujah let's bow
[1:24:48] our heads Lord Jesus Lord you see in my
[1:24:57] heart lord I these things Lord of just
[1:25:01] burning but lord I I certainly didn't
[1:25:04] mean tonight Lord - Lord - perhaps -
[1:25:07] minister Lord I just wanted to share a
[1:25:09] few thoughts but lord I prayed your God
[1:25:14] that father these thoughts Lord that
[1:25:17] have been shared Lord
[1:25:18] Oh God like Lord would look like the
[1:25:24] Lord - look at it from up here it looks
[1:25:25] like Lourdes things are just scattered
[1:25:29] out Lord but father how things that you
[1:25:32] come Lord and just inspiring and
[1:25:34] bringing it together to speak to us Lord
[1:25:38] I'm glad to be reminded I'm glad to be
[1:25:44] reminded that you're more than enough
[1:25:49] Paul would testify and say our
[1:25:52] sufficiency is not of ourselves our
[1:25:55] sufficiency is of the Lord
[1:26:00] Lord God it's by your strength Lord you
[1:26:08] provide just what we have need of you
[1:26:12] place the Lord God in our hands what
[1:26:14] we're able to handle and father even
[1:26:17] what you would put within our hands
[1:26:19] whatever Lord that that it would be may
[1:26:22] we walk in our lives like Solomon did
[1:26:26] Lord when things were placed before
[1:26:29] Solomon Solomon he made a request Lord
[1:26:33] so I've been very dear to my heart where
[1:26:35] Solomon would ask of you and say Lord
[1:26:38] will you order my going in and my coming
[1:26:41] out
[1:26:43] Lord Jesus Solomon had been raised in
[1:26:47] the house of a king he saw his daddy as
[1:26:52] a king he watched these things but he
[1:26:57] wanted that same unction that David had
[1:27:03] he wanted you to mold his character is
[1:27:08] going out and his coming in he wanted
[1:27:11] you to do that Lord father this is our
[1:27:15] desire Lord that you would just continue
[1:27:20] to mold us or do you know the needs just
[1:27:26] some things Lord that came forth as a
[1:27:28] testimony tonight witnessing Lord how
[1:27:32] that you have provided
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:37] ward on and on we could go with
[1:27:39] testimonies in with that Lord Lord I
[1:27:48] believe go hard with all of our hearts
[1:27:52] or do we have a testimony
[1:27:56] or God of you're keeping power
[1:28:00] sustaining strength comfort
[1:28:06] all-father how we appreciate your order
[1:28:09] we just love your Lord Jesus
[1:28:13] well god I think of it the children of
[1:28:17] Israel they're in a natural their
[1:28:20] garment never ever tattered their feet
[1:28:26] were never swollen
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:30] I'm grateful Lord that is that spoke of
[1:28:33] that there I know that you can still do
[1:28:34] that
[1:28:35] I've just heard a testimony Lord God I
[1:28:40] can't remember the number of years but
[1:28:43] Lord I heard a testimony brother Tim
[1:28:45] humans had given brother in Africa they
[1:28:48] bought him a suit and that brother wore
[1:28:50] that suit Lord I'm looking at it now I
[1:28:53] don't know if it was 30 years or what
[1:28:54] that suit they end up burying him in
[1:28:57] that suit he wore that suit continuously
[1:29:00] it never wore out there was a testimony
[1:29:06] Lord I heard that Lord when brother Tim
[1:29:11] had shared that it just it just touched
[1:29:14] my heart
[1:29:15] because we know that Lord there's a
[1:29:17] garment of the Holy Spirit place Lord in
[1:29:20] our life that never wears out but to see
[1:29:24] how that God that you would take that
[1:29:26] Lord of a need within that brother's
[1:29:28] life or as a minister and that suit that
[1:29:31] was bought for him it wouldn't wear out
[1:29:35] as a testimony it wasn't that he kept it
[1:29:39] up Lord when I can recall as by the Tim
[1:29:42] was sharing that testimony it wasn't
[1:29:43] that he kept it up it wasn't that he
[1:29:45] sparsely wore it
[1:29:50] Lord you just do those things to do it
[1:29:56] to show your God it's not just for not
[1:30:01] but it's testimonies its witnesses Lord
[1:30:06] of your grace and I'm just simple enough
[1:30:09] to believe that Lord I'm simple enough
[1:30:13] to believe that
[1:30:15] I believe Lord Garvin I'm standing here
[1:30:19] tonight with brothers and sisters simple
[1:30:22] enough just to believe that Lord for
[1:30:24] whatever the need would be the
[1:30:27] circumstance Lord the situation that
