[29:31] the word. And so, it's good to be in

[29:35] the opportunity. It's always good to be
[29:37] with you all and and thankful to Brother
[29:40] Samuel for the confidence to have us be
[29:42] here. Amen. So God bless you as we sing

[29:47] Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; This is this is just an older song and

[30:20] the dust
[30:23] of the earth.
[30:26] My God
[30:31] with his breath
[30:37] of living soul. [music]
[30:43] And God
[30:45] so [singing and music]
[30:45] loved the world
[30:48] he gave
[30:50] his [singing] only son.
[30:54] And that
[30:56] [music] is why [singing] I love him so.
[31:04] For I was [music] made [singing]
[31:08] in his likeness,
[31:11] created [singing]
[31:13] in his image.
[31:16] For I
[31:20] was born [singing] to serve the Lord
[31:27] and I
[31:31] can't deny [singing]
[31:32] him.
[31:33] I will always
[31:36] walk beside him. [singing]
[31:39] For I
[31:42] was born [singing]
[31:44] to serve [music] the Lord.
[31:50] And my hands
[31:53] [singing and music] were made
[31:57] to help
[31:59] [singing]
[31:59] my neighbor.
[32:02] And my eyes
[32:05] were made to read God's word.
[32:12] [singing]
[32:13] Oh, and my feet
[32:16] [music]
[32:16] were made
[32:18] [singing]
[32:19] to walk
[32:22] in his footsteps.
[32:24] And my body
[32:27] [music and singing] is the temple
[32:30] of the Lord.
[32:35] For I was made
[32:39] [music and singing] in his likeness
[32:41] and created
[32:44] in his image. [singing and music]
[32:48] I
[32:50] was born [singing] to serve the Lord.
[32:57] Oh, and I
[33:00] [singing] can't [music] deny him.
[33:03] I will always
[33:06] walk beside [music and singing]
[33:08] him. There I
[33:12] was born [singing and music]
[33:14] to serve the Lord.
[33:20] For I [singing] was made
[33:24] in his likeness
[33:26] and created
[33:29] in his image.
[33:32] Oh, and I
[33:34] [screaming]
[33:35] was born to serve the Lord.
[33:43] Oh, and I
[33:45] [music] can't [singing] deny him.
[33:48] I will always
[33:51] walk beside him. [singing]
[33:54] Oh, I
[33:57] was [singing] born to [music] serve the
[34:00] Lord.
[34:05] For [singing] I
[34:08] was born
[34:10] [singing]
[34:12] to serve the Lord.
[34:16] [singing]
[34:21] &gt;&gt; [applause and music]
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your testimony tonight?
[34:30] Amen. I believe it's what we were born
[34:32] to do. Amen. To serve the Lord. [music]
[34:36] Amen. If you could stand with me tonight
[34:39] and we'll go straight into the word.
[34:41] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll
[34:43] turn to Isaiah chapter 21.
[34:47] Amen. And
[34:50] It's good to have little Spencer with us
[34:53] tonight, too. I'm sure you'll hear him
[34:55] at some point, but he's he's the joy of
[35:00] our our home. He's he's my buddy. Amen.
[35:04] Isaiah 21, just two verses here and then
[35:08] we'll read two verses out of Isaiah 60.
[35:11] Thank you, musicians.
[35:14] says the burden of the desert
[35:17] or forgive me sorry 11 verse 11 of
[35:20] chapter 21 the burden of Duma he calleth
[35:23] to me out of sire watchmen what of the
[35:26] night watchmen what of the night the
[35:28] watchman said the morning cometh and
[35:31] also the night if you will inquire
[35:33] inquire ye return come in Isaiah 60
[35:38] verse one and two very familiar passage
[35:40] arise shine for thy light has Come, and
[35:44] the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[35:46] thee. For behold, the darkness shall
[35:49] cover the earth, and gross darkness the
[35:50] people, but the Lord shall arise upon
[35:53] thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
[35:56] thee. Amen. Could we bow our heads
[35:58] tonight for a word of prayer? Heavenly
[36:00] Father, we just so appreciate this
[36:02] opportunity to come into your presence
[36:04] tonight,
[36:06] Lord. We can't think of a better way to
[36:07] bring in a new year, Father, Lord, than
[36:10] to come and ga gather together with
[36:12] saints of like precious faith, Lord, and
[36:14] fellowship around your word, Father. And
[36:17] Lord, we just pray that you come and
[36:18] make it a special gathering, Father,
[36:20] that it'd be more than just a
[36:22] protractive meeting as a prophet would
[36:24] say, but Father, may you step down into
[36:26] our midst, Lord, and take a hold of this
[36:28] word, Father, and use it for your glory,
[36:30] I pray, once more. May you set aside
[36:32] both the speaker and the hearer, Father.
[36:35] And Lord, may it be a a a fellowship
[36:37] between you and your children, Father,
[36:40] as we feed on your word together. May
[36:42] you be glorified and manifested amongst
[36:44] us. And I pray you just minister to each
[36:46] need, Lord, of your children, those that
[36:48] are here, those that might not be able
[36:50] to be here tonight. I pray you be with
[36:51] them wherever they're at, Lord, and just
[36:54] have your way amongst us. I pray in
[36:56] Jesus name. Amen. And you may be seated
[36:59] tonight.
[37:01] Amen. And if it's okay, by the grace of
[37:03] God, we want to take a few moments.
[37:06] Amen. In these passages and just if we
[37:08] could have a title, we'd like to speak
[37:10] on it. It's time to shine. It's time to
[37:13] shine. Amen. Uh, brother Brandon would
[37:15] speak to us about how the heavenlies are
[37:19] type of what's coming on earth. And he
[37:21] said God declares his doings in the
[37:23] heaven before the earth. And the first
[37:26] Bible, of course, that that God would
[37:28] write would be in the heavens. Is that
[37:30] right? Of course, we could see that in
[37:33] uh in in the the constellations how
[37:36] there would be Virgo, which would be a
[37:38] type of his first coming and then there
[37:41] would be Leo, which would be a type of
[37:43] his second coming as he would come as a
[37:45] lion and come as a virgin. And and also
[37:49] we just come through the holiday season
[37:51] and of course we know that that Jesus
[37:53] wasn't born in December, but when he was
[37:56] born, brother Brandon would tell us how
[37:58] those three stars aligned and they were
[38:00] pointing that there was something
[38:03] significant taking place on earth and it
[38:05] was the birth of an infant savior, the
[38:07] birth of an infant king and a and all
[38:10] the way back coming up into our
[38:12] generation in 1962, brother Brandham
[38:15] said, "What would just happen? Five
[38:17] stars just aligned and the earth just
[38:19] about come into an explosion. He said,
[38:22] "What's happening?" It's the birth of an
[38:24] infant bride. Amen. And before it ever
[38:26] happened on earth, it happened in the
[38:28] heavenlies. God was showing a birth
[38:31] taking place all throughout from his
[38:32] first coming to his second coming. Amen.
[38:35] God is declaring in the heavens what
[38:37] he's going to do on earth. Amen. And
[38:39] also, brother Brandon would tell us that
[38:41] every Christian is a star. We see that
[38:43] the stars are are just a type or an
[38:46] example of the lives of Christians in in
[38:49] the Bible. Way back in the beginning
[38:52] when brother Revelations talks about how
[38:54] a dragon's tail would come and gather
[38:56] twothirds of the stars of heaven, that
[38:59] was speaking uh of individuals or
[39:01] spirits that would come down and and
[39:04] inhabit vessels on earth.
[39:07] and and and even in the book of
[39:08] revelation it would say that the seven
[39:10] stars to the seven churches which we of
[39:12] course know are are individuals it's the
[39:15] seven messengers it's it's brother
[39:17] Brandham and Paul and the different
[39:18] messengers and so we see that that
[39:21] children of God are as the stars even as
[39:23] the Bible would say about the seed of
[39:26] Abraham that look now toward heaven and
[39:28] tell the stars if thou be able to number
[39:30] them and he said unto them so shall thy
[39:33] seed be is that right and then in
[39:35] Deuteron Oonomy it said the Lord your
[39:37] God hath multiplied you and behold ye
[39:39] are this day as the stars of heaven. I
[39:42] think that's I think that's wonderful.
[39:44] We can look in Genesis and it says
[39:46] behold Abraham your seed shall be like
[39:48] the stars. And a few book a few books
[39:50] later lo and behold God kept his word.
[39:52] He said your seed is now as the stars.
[39:55] And so I believe we can very boldly
[39:57] declare that every Christian is a star.
[40:00] Brother Brandham said that we are stars.
[40:02] Every born Christian is a testimony to
[40:05] the Lord Jesus Christ to reflect the
[40:07] power and holiness of the Lord Jesus. To
[40:10] reflect him in his life, perfect him in
[40:12] his speech, perfect him in his healing
[40:14] power, perfect him in his resurrection,
[40:16] to reflect him in every way that he was
[40:18] reflected to us by God the Father. We
[40:21] are stars. Amen. We are stars and we
[40:23] have one job and our job is only to
[40:26] reflect Jesus Christ on this earth.
[40:29] Amen. Just like a sheep has one job and
[40:31] that is to bear wool. He doesn't have to
[40:34] manufacture anything. So we have one job
[40:37] and that is just to reflect. Amen. Just
[40:39] to reflect Christ. Amen. We're not
[40:41] called to reflect our school. We're not
[40:43] called to reflect the news. We're not
[40:46] called to reflect. Amen. The sports or
[40:49] else we'd have a lot of dim stars this
[40:51] morning [laughter] after last night,
[40:52] wouldn't we? But thank God that that's
[40:54] not what we're here to reflect. We're
[40:56] here to reflect Jesus Christ. Amen. and
[40:58] and we have a constant source of light
[41:01] and that's the sunlight of Jesus Christ.
[41:03] And so no matter what h amen if you're
[41:05] reflecting the world or things of the
[41:07] world you'll be up one day and down the
[41:09] next and up one day and down the next
[41:10] but there's a constant source of light
[41:13] amen that the believer can come into
[41:15] contact with and if that's what you're
[41:17] reflecting amen you'll have a stability
[41:19] you'll have a steadfastness amen that's
[41:22] what brings an overcoming life amen
[41:24] that's what takes you out of the hills
[41:25] and the valleys amen [snorts] is when
[41:27] you come into a contact with a source
[41:30] that changes not amen then no matter
[41:33] matter where you're at, what you're
[41:34] going through. Amen. There is something
[41:36] that is tied to your life by an absolute
[41:40] Amen. that you will always amen reflect
[41:43] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; It's it's stars. Stars that are to guide
[41:48] others to Christ and stars that are to
[41:50] be led by the Holy Spirit. As the Bible
[41:53] said, there is therefore now no
[41:54] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[41:57] Jesus who walk not after the flesh, but
[42:00] after the spirit. And brother Brandham
[42:01] said, if we're going to be a star to
[42:03] reflect the light of Christ, to bring
[42:05] sinners to him, we've got to be guided
[42:07] by the Holy Spirit. Amen. And we want to
[42:10] be led by the Holy Spirit. We want the
[42:12] Holy Spirit to lead us to be what he's
[42:14] called us to be. Amen. Not to be what
[42:17] he's called someone else to be. Not to
[42:19] try to be. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'm not
[42:21] here to be a pastor. I'm not here Amen.
[42:24] I'm here to be an evangelist tonight
[42:26] because that's what he's called me to
[42:27] be. That's the work that I'm doing. And
[42:29] the musicians are in their part. And the
[42:31] Amen. The lay members are in their part.
[42:33] And everyone's in their part. Amen.
[42:34] Because the Bible said there's one glory
[42:36] of the sun and another glory of the moon
[42:39] and another glory of the stars. For one
[42:41] star differth from another star in
[42:44] glory. And brother Brandon said there's
[42:45] angels. There's saraphims. There's
[42:47] different. There's cherubams. Amen. And
[42:49] each one has their place. And so does
[42:51] the moon have its place and the sun has
[42:53] its place. Amen. And we're not to try to
[42:55] be like one another. Amen. But we're
[42:58] here to stand in our position as sons
[43:00] and daughters of God and reflect him in
[43:02] whatever place that he's called us to
[43:04] be. Amen. I think it's a beautiful
[43:06] thing. Amen. I think it's the economy of
[43:08] God. I think it it it's your adoption.
[43:11] It's God placing you. Amen. As a mother
[43:13] or as a deacon, as a housewife, and in
[43:16] that position, you reflect Christ in
[43:18] whatever capacity or avenue that he's
[43:21] called you to reflect him.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, Lord, let me reflect you.
[43:26] Amen. wherever you place me. And brother
[43:28] Bram said, what does the star mean to us
[43:30] today, friend? And then he said, Daniel
[43:32] gives us the answer in Daniel 12:3. They
[43:35] that be wise shall shine as the
[43:37] brightness of the firmament, and they
[43:39] that turn many to righteousness as the
[43:42] stars forever and ever. Amen. Brother
[43:45] Bram talked about how he was standing
[43:47] there and he looked out at that morning
[43:49] star and he would say, "My, it's still
[43:51] shining just as bright as it did the day
[43:54] that Jesus Christ blew it off." Amen.
[43:56] God Elohim blew it off and said, "Let
[43:59] there be light." And it went out there
[44:01] and shone. He said, "It's still shining
[44:02] just as bright." But he would say, "But
[44:04] hold on, little star." Amen. We're
[44:06] coming. Because Daniel said that they
[44:09] that are wise shall shine as the
[44:11] brightness of the firmament, and they
[44:13] that turn many to righteousness as the
[44:15] stars forever and ever. Brother Ram
[44:18] said, "Morning star, you are shining
[44:20] now, but wait till we get there."
[44:22] Hallelujah. Amen. I say the stars better
[44:25] shine while they can because there's
[44:27] some sons and daughters of God, amen,
[44:29] that are manifesting Jesus Christ on the
[44:31] earth now that when we when we get on
[44:33] the other side, we will outshine the
[44:36] stars for ever and ever. Amen. From
[44:39] glory onto glory, amen, those that are
[44:42] wise, amen, shall shine on that day. And
[44:45] so what we want to look at this night is
[44:47] is stars. But we want to focus in on on
[44:50] that morning star. That morning star
[44:53] comes out just before daybreak and all
[44:56] the other stars fade away and the moon
[44:58] is gone. He stands alone as God's
[45:00] watchman and just before the break of
[45:02] day, the sun reflects against the
[45:05] morning star and refle reflects the true
[45:07] light of that true sun. And and brother
[45:11] Brandon would get in conversation with
[45:13] somebody, you know, about how do stars
[45:15] reflect their own light or do they give
[45:17] off their own light? and he would just
[45:19] begin to talk about it how stars are a
[45:21] part of the main giver and maybe some
[45:24] stars, you know, spring off of one sun
[45:26] and spring off of another sun. But but
[45:29] we want to look at what is it from our
[45:31] perspective here on Earth because some
[45:33] stars may be way out there and bigger
[45:35] than others. But when we're standing
[45:36] here on Earth and you look out, there's
[45:38] one star. It's the sun and that's the
[45:40] biggest star. And when that sun begins
[45:43] to set off the scene for the night, then
[45:46] there comes the the the the the morning
[45:48] star would come out first and be a a
[45:51] bigger star. And then then there would
[45:53] be little stars, you know, between
[45:55] there. But then there would come another
[45:57] big star in the evening, which would be
[45:59] the evening star. And those were the the
[46:01] bigger stars. They're prominent stars.
[46:03] And they come out in the morning and the
[46:05] evening. And there might be some little
[46:07] star messengers between those two stars.
[46:10] All right? And so and so when the sun
[46:12] rises, all the other lights go out and
[46:15] and then of course there's the moon
[46:17] which which would which would be a type
[46:19] of the church. Is that right? And so and
[46:22] so some stars may you know like the sun
[46:25] gives off its own light but the morning
[46:27] star is different because the morning
[46:29] star is actually a planet. It's Venus
[46:32] and it's close to the sun and planets
[46:35] don't give off their own light but
[46:36] planets actually reflect light. Amen.
[46:39] Just like the moon, they only reflect
[46:41] the light of the sun. And so, and so
[46:43] this morning star is Venus. A a and the
[46:46] morning star and the evening star are
[46:48] actually the very same star. It's not a
[46:51] different star. It's the same exact
[46:53] star. And the beautiful the beautiful
[46:55] thing about it is it's near the sun. I
[46:58] mean, it's just two away from the sun.
[47:00] And so, this morning star is the same as
[47:03] the evening star. It just matters the
[47:05] rotation of the earth whether you're
[47:07] seeing it in the east or whether you're
[47:09] seeing it in the west. Amen. So what
[47:12] we're trying to say, brother Brandon
[47:13] brings it out. There's quotes, but amen
[47:15] just to just to quickly say it. Amen.
[47:18] Near to the sun, which would be the son
[47:20] of God. Amen. To the son of man. Amen.
[47:22] When Jesus came in the first coming of
[47:25] Christ, John the Baptist was the morning
[47:28] star. He came near the son. He
[47:30] introduced the son. Behold the lamb of
[47:33] God which comes to take away the sin of
[47:35] the world. Then there come dark ages and
[47:38] there might have been some little
[47:39] messengers through those dark ages. But
[47:41] in the evening time the same son that
[47:44] rose in the east would come to the west
[47:46] and the same star would come out again.
[47:48] Only this time it would be the evening
[47:50] star and then it would be the same
[47:53] Elijah ministry would return. Amen.
[47:55] Brother Brandon would point it to the
[47:57] scriptures. Behold, I'll send you Elijah
[47:59] before the great and dreadful day of the
[48:01] Lord. He'll turn the hearts of the
[48:03] fathers to the children. Amen. That's
[48:05] the eastern star. And the hearts of the
[48:07] children to the fathers. That's the
[48:09] western star. Amen. But it's the same
[48:11] Elijah ministry. One was in John the
[48:13] Baptist and one was in brother Brandham.
[48:16] Amen. But it's the morning star. It's
[48:18] the evening star reflecting Christ to
[48:21] the world. Amen. Brother Brandon was
[48:23] that evening star. And I think it's
[48:26] amazing. We were actually just out in
[48:27] Colorado in September. Me and and Brian
[48:31] Jr. and and and Brother Wayne, we were
[48:34] out there hunting elk. And we were out
[48:36] there camping in the woods. And there's
[48:37] a mountain there called Mount Hesperis.
[48:40] And we we went up there, drove out there
[48:42] in the evening, and and we camped and we
[48:45] built a a campfire up there in those
[48:47] mountains. I forget the name of the
[48:48] mountain range. I think I've got it in
[48:50] there. Amen. But Mount Hesperis actually
[48:52] means evening star and it was named that
[48:56] because of its western location. And
[48:59] brother Brandon would go out there and
[49:00] hunt with brother Jim Ed Dalton. And he
[49:03] would love to hunt out in Colorado and
[49:05] he would build camps out there and hunt
[49:07] right on Mount Hesperis which was the
[49:10] the very definition was evening star.
[49:13] And it was pretty awesome to be out
[49:15] there and build a campfire in the same
[49:17] spot and just think about what God has
[49:19] done in this age. Amen. He sent us an
[49:21] evening star. Amen. To introduce to us
[49:24] the return of the sun. Amen. Because
[49:27] brother Brandham, amen, in the evening
[49:29] time at Shabai, he had an evening time
[49:31] ministry. It was token time. It was it
[49:33] was evening time. But he would also
[49:35] preach to us a message. It is the rising
[49:38] of the sun. Amen. So we could look to it
[49:41] as evening time. But at the same time as
[49:44] it was evening for the world. It was the
[49:47] setting of the sun for churches and
[49:49] denominations. But for the bride, it was
[49:52] [laughter] the introducing of a new day.
[49:54] Amen. For the bride, it was daybreak was
[49:57] coming. Amen. The millennium is coming.
[49:59] Amen. Amen. Brightness. Amen. And a new
[50:02] day is coming to those that would
[50:04] receive the message of the hour. Amen.
[50:06] So, amen. I I hope that's okay to lay a
[50:09] foundation when we're looking at this
[50:10] morning's star. To me, it's the ministry
[50:13] of the prophet. Amen. But it's also the
[50:15] ministry of those that are under the
[50:17] prophets's message. Amen. Because
[50:19] brother Brandham say, "What is it?" The
[50:21] morning star, the church of the living
[50:23] God today. Amen. Who's the watchman on
[50:27] the tower warning the nations and the
[50:29] people? It stands alone. A man that
[50:31] stands for God stands alone. But what's
[50:33] he doing? Reflecting the same light of
[50:35] the sun that went down years ago and is
[50:38] rising again.
[50:40] Oh, you see, that's what a star does. It
[50:43] shines in the absence of the sun. Which
[50:46] means to us that the sun can still have
[50:49] a ministry on the earth even when you
[50:52] cannot see the sun. Amen. Even when the
[50:54] sun is not on the scene. Amen. The sun
[50:57] still has a ministry. Amen. Because
[50:59] there's a morning star church that's
[51:02] reflecting the light of the sun. Even in
[51:04] the absence of the sun, even in total
[51:07] darkness, even when Jesus Christ, Amen,
[51:10] let the scene, Amen, to go away for a
[51:12] period, Amen, he always had a ministry.
[51:15] And even now when the world can't see
[51:17] the sun, amen, because he's hid behind a
[51:20] veil. There is a church, a morning star
[51:22] church that is reflecting the light of
[51:24] the sun. Brother Brandham had a question
[51:26] one time. Will the bride have a ministry
[51:28] before the rapture? And he said, yes.
[51:30] That's what's happening right now. Amen.
[51:32] It's the ministry of the morning star.
[51:35] It's the ministry of those that have got
[51:37] under the message of the hour and are
[51:39] standing as watchmen on the tower
[51:41] reflecting the light of the sun while
[51:44] the world has gone into total darkness.
[51:46] Amen. It's a ministry. Brother Bram
[51:48] said, "What is the true church's
[51:50] ministry?" The ministry of that church
[51:52] will be the ministry of the sun because
[51:54] it's a reflection of the same sun power
[51:57] and the same sun light that the world
[51:59] will know when the sun rises what it
[52:02] will look like. Amen. It is brother Bam
[52:05] said it's now it isn't the church it
[52:07] isn't the person it's the sun that's
[52:09] reflecting on the star that reflects the
[52:11] sunlight to the earth. Amen. This
[52:14] morning star ministry is not to reflect
[52:17] a church. It's to reflect the sun. Amen.
[52:20] That's why brother Brandon would, you
[52:22] know, warn about how to be careful that
[52:25] you go all the way into the spirit of
[52:27] Christ and not just into the spirit of a
[52:30] church. Amen. Amen. That's a dangerous
[52:32] place to stop. Amen. Just to just to get
[52:35] a spirit of a church or a religious
[52:37] spirit. But when you go all the way into
[52:39] the spirit of Christ, amen, then you
[52:41] reflect more than just your church or
[52:44] more than just Amen. Amen. This or that.
[52:46] But you will reflect the very same life.
[52:49] Amen. That's shown in Jesus Christ when
[52:51] he was here on earth.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram said the same
[52:57] ministry that the sun went down in, the
[53:00] same light he went down in is coming
[53:02] again in the resurrection power in the
[53:05] morning star is reflecting that light.
[53:08] Amen. The same sun that shone in the
[53:10] east is shining in the west. Just like
[53:13] brother Brandon would say, if that tree
[53:15] ever puts forth another branch, it'll be
[53:19] another book of Acts written behind it.
[53:22] [laughter] Amen. I like how brother
[53:23] Brandon tells the story and he's telling
[53:26] it a little bit in the in the side of
[53:28] darkness about how about how uh uh I
[53:32] believe it was a a husband was reading
[53:33] the newspaper or wife, I forget which
[53:35] way it was, and the other one asked him,
[53:36] "Is there anything new in the news?" And
[53:38] they said, "No, it's just the same news,
[53:41] only different people." Amen. And that's
[53:44] true in in and that's true in the
[53:45] darkness. But I believe that's also true
[53:47] in the light. [laughter] Amen. Amen. The
[53:50] same news that was written, Amen. in the
[53:53] book of Acts is being written again.
[53:55] It's only different people. Amen. You
[53:57] can't hardly tell the difference as it
[53:59] gets closer and closer as that capstone
[54:02] has come down. Amen. It's the same news.
[54:05] The good news that was introduced when
[54:07] Jesus Christ came. Amen. What a
[54:09] resurrection that was. But what a
[54:11] resurrection this is. Amen. The same
[54:13] news is being written again. Only this
[54:15] time it's in the hearts of sons and
[54:17] daughters and of God under this evening
[54:20] light. Amen. As the Bible said in
[54:22] Hebrews 11, they without us cannot be
[54:25] made perfect. It'll take the ministry of
[54:28] Jesus Christ in a bride to come so close
[54:32] a till it would be that capstone would
[54:34] be so honed that it could set down on
[54:37] the rest of that pyramid. Amen. That's
[54:40] what the church's ministry is. It's the
[54:42] ministry of the sun has returned again
[54:46] in bride form. Amen. We have entered
[54:49] into a light age. It's the ministry of
[54:53] the morning star. Brother Brandham said
[54:55] how we've gone through justification,
[54:56] we've gone through sanctification, we've
[54:59] gone through through Pentecost and all
[55:01] those things, but brother Brandham said,
[55:03] "Now coming into that morning star,
[55:06] begin to reflect." Amen. Let me just
[55:08] read it if that's okay. He said, "Seeing
[55:10] the ministry come from just shall live
[55:13] by faith in Martin Luther,
[55:15] sanctification by John Wesley, the
[55:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost by the
[55:18] Pentecostals and the restoration of
[55:20] gifts." And now coming into that morning
[55:23] star, beginning to reflect. Amen.
[55:26] Brother Brandon would go on to use the
[55:28] phrase the fourth light. Amen. There was
[55:31] a little bit of light in Martin Luther
[55:33] and then there was a little bit more
[55:35] light in Wesley and then there was a
[55:36] little bit more light. But now we've
[55:38] come into that fourth light. And that
[55:40] fourth light would be the word itself
[55:43] returning into the bride of Jesus
[55:45] Christ. Amen. Total reflection. Amen.
[55:49] Total illumination. Amen. As the word
[55:51] has come and the seals have been ripped
[55:54] off. Amen. That word has penetrated in
[55:56] the hearts of sons and daughters of God.
[55:59] Amen. And they are a total reflection of
[56:02] Jesus Christ. Amen. that have come out
[56:04] of dark denominations and come into the
[56:07] light. Oh, what a glorious thing.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham could say
[56:12] that Isaiah wasn't wrong when he wrote
[56:15] this scripture. He said he wasn't out of
[56:17] order when he said morning cometh and
[56:20] night also because you you would think
[56:22] that it should be night cometh and
[56:24] morning also. But he said morning cometh
[56:26] and night also. And brother Bram said,
[56:29] "We've had that first little light."
[56:31] Just like if you watch, Brother Bram
[56:33] say, if you go out and the sun as it
[56:36] begins to rise, he said there's a little
[56:37] bit of light comes in and then it gets
[56:40] darker. The darkest part of the night
[56:42] comes and then comes the fullness. Then
[56:44] comes the actual sunrise. Amen. But he
[56:47] said that's that's how it is in the
[56:49] spiritual. He said, "We've had that
[56:50] first little light of these healing
[56:53] campaigns and people being raised from
[56:55] the dead and all these things." Amen.
[56:57] But then that dark period be begin to
[57:00] settle down upon the church and he said
[57:02] that is when the morning star comes out
[57:04] and begins to shine. Amen. We've had
[57:07] amen that those healing campaigns that
[57:10] mean the miraculous swept in. Amen. But
[57:12] but but then the church begin to go into
[57:14] total darkness. Amen. But that's when
[57:16] the ministry of the morning star would
[57:18] come out to shine. That's when the
[57:20] message would really come forth and
[57:22] begin to catch a hold in sons and
[57:25] daughters of God. Amen. That's when the
[57:27] word really begin to be open. Amen. As
[57:29] the world went into total darkness. Oh
[57:32] my. Something was happening on the
[57:34] earth. It was coming. Amen. A a a
[57:38] breaking of day.
[57:40] Amen. But it's in that going between
[57:42] time to shine when it's the darkest.
[57:45] Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; It's that going between
[57:48] that's when the morning star comes out
[57:50] and says shalom. Right?
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Because this bride is shining in Leo
[57:56] [clears throat] to see in darkness.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "A little while
[58:00] and the world won't see me no more." And
[58:02] then in parenthesis it says, "It'll be
[58:04] dark. The world can't see him anymore
[58:08] because it's dark." But it said, "But ye
[58:11] shall see me because I live. Ye will
[58:14] live also." Oh my. I amen. I'm thankful,
[58:18] friends, that in the darkest time the
[58:20] world has ever seen. Amen. That a
[58:22] prophet would step out as a morning star
[58:25] and say, "Shalom to the church of the
[58:28] living God." Amen. God sent us a true
[58:30] watchman. And the true watchman won't
[58:33] deny any word of God. Is that right?
[58:35] Amen. That's why we should never argue
[58:37] with the watchmen. [laughter] Amen.
[58:39] Because the watchman, Amen, is placed
[58:42] higher in the tower than anybody else is
[58:44] placed. Amen. That's why you might think
[58:47] you have a better idea than brother
[58:48] Brandham had. You might think, Amen,
[58:51] that that he was off here and he was off
[58:53] there and amen this was a little bit too
[58:55] strong or this was a little bit Amen.
[58:57] But be very careful because you are not
[59:00] seeing the same thing that he was
[59:02] seeing. Amen. We are not built as
[59:05] prophets. Amen. We have an eyesight of
[59:07] an eagle because of a prophetic
[59:09] ministry. Amen. But we were not up there
[59:12] in the tower where he was. Amen. He was
[59:14] the highest one in the tower. He could
[59:17] declare, "Emon, if this spirit gets in
[59:19] the church, it'll lead to that, and this
[59:21] one will lead to that." And because of
[59:22] that, if you'll listen to the watchman,
[59:24] you can say, "All right, if we cut this
[59:26] off here, it won't go any farther. And
[59:29] if we cut this off here, it won't go any
[59:31] farther because we have the vision of a
[59:34] watchman." Amen. We should never argue
[59:36] with our watchman. Amen. Because he was
[59:38] high in the tower. And when he was up
[59:41] there, he looked one way and he looked
[59:43] another way. And in one way there was a
[59:46] darkness coming over the earth. And when
[59:48] he could look the other way, he could
[59:50] see a mourning cometh also. That's why
[59:52] he could come and preach a message.
[59:54] Shalom. Amen. Because he'd been up in a
[59:57] tower and he said, "Oh my, darkness is
[1:00:00] coming on the earth." Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:03] I've seen visions of the world. Amen.
[1:00:05] Going to ashes. I've seen amen. All
[1:00:07] these terrible things are coming upon
[1:00:09] the earth and gross darkness is coming
[1:00:12] upon the people and religious spirits
[1:00:14] and spiritual death is settling upon the
[1:00:16] church. I mean what what was he telling
[1:00:19] us? He was saying that the the the the
[1:00:22] earth has got between or the moon has
[1:00:25] got between the earth and the sun or or
[1:00:27] or or the other way around but it
[1:00:30] eclipsed. So, so, so what he was telling
[1:00:32] us, you're all very familiar, so we'll
[1:00:34] just go through it. But, but, but, but,
[1:00:36] but, but those seven pictures of the
[1:00:37] moon phases that we can see of the seven
[1:00:40] church ages. Amen. Brother Brandon
[1:00:42] begins to tell us, Amen. that that that
[1:00:44] that the moon which represents the
[1:00:46] church begin to go into total darkness.
[1:00:50] He said there how that moon began to set
[1:00:52] into darkness through those dark ages.
[1:00:55] And then as as as God began to restore
[1:00:57] through Luther and Wesley, it would get
[1:00:59] brighter and brighter and in Leodosia,
[1:01:02] it looked like it was starting to get
[1:01:04] brighter. But all of a sudden, it went
[1:01:06] into total eclipse and total darkness
[1:01:09] settled upon the church. And he said it
[1:01:11] happened when the pope visited
[1:01:13] Jerusalem. He said it was Pope Paul V
[1:01:16] 6th, which was only a perversion. Amen.
[1:01:18] Because he said it's no coincidence that
[1:01:20] his name was Paul because our first
[1:01:22] messenger was named Paul. Amen. only six
[1:01:25] is the number of man. It was an
[1:01:27] impostor. It was a messenger earthly. It
[1:01:30] was uh it was a signpost. Amen. As that
[1:01:34] moon would go into total eclipse, amen,
[1:01:36] that the earth and the church and the
[1:01:38] natural systems were all heading into
[1:01:41] total darkness. Amen. But as that would
[1:01:44] take place, there would be a prophecy
[1:01:46] that morning cometh also. Amen. And the
[1:01:49] Bible says, "I, John, saw the holy city,
[1:01:52] New Jerusalem, coming down from God out
[1:01:55] of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned
[1:01:57] for her husband."
[1:01:59] And in Galatians 4 says, "For this Aar
[1:02:02] is Mount Si in Arabia, and answerth to
[1:02:06] Jerusalem, which now is and is in
[1:02:09] bondage with her children. But
[1:02:12] Jerusalem, which is above, is free,
[1:02:15] which is the mother of us all." Amen. So
[1:02:18] there's two Jerusalems, right? There's
[1:02:20] an earthly Jerusalem, the moon, the
[1:02:22] church, but there's a spiritual
[1:02:25] Jerusalem, which is the bride. Amen. And
[1:02:28] as Paul V 6 was visiting natural
[1:02:31] Jerusalem, the church was going into
[1:02:33] total darkness. But at the same time,
[1:02:36] Amen, there was a seventh angel
[1:02:37] messenger visiting the new Jerusalem
[1:02:41] bride. And he was saying, "Shalom unto
[1:02:44] you." Amen. You that are God's bride.
[1:02:47] You which have received this message
[1:02:49] which has come through my ministry.
[1:02:51] Amen. The world is getting darker and
[1:02:53] darker. But if you have received this
[1:02:56] word of truth, it's going to get
[1:02:58] brighter and brighter and brighter.
[1:03:00] Amen. Amen. You think it's bright now as
[1:03:03] we sit under this message. You just
[1:03:05] wait. It's just getting started. Amen.
[1:03:07] It's just morning time. Amen. Daybreak
[1:03:10] is coming. Amen. There is coming a time
[1:03:13] that mo [laughter] I MEAN EARTH AND
[1:03:15] CREATION is groaning and travailing.
[1:03:17] Amen. It's in birth pains until it's
[1:03:20] going to birth forth a millennium earth.
[1:03:22] Amen. That's the daybreak we're looking
[1:03:24] for, brother Paul. There's a millennium
[1:03:26] coming. There's a new earth coming.
[1:03:29] Amen. But if you've received this
[1:03:31] message in your heart, amen. You've
[1:03:33] already heard the announcement. Good
[1:03:35] morning unto you. Shalom unto you. Amen.
[1:03:38] You may be coming into a new year. Amen.
[1:03:41] But there is a new hope in the heart of
[1:03:44] the believer. We're closer now than
[1:03:46] we've ever been. Amen. We have crested,
[1:03:49] amen, through, amen, many dark nights.
[1:03:53] Oh, and the same message that brought us
[1:03:55] through those dark nights will carry us
[1:03:57] through the rest of the dark nights
[1:03:59] until that daybreak finally crest over
[1:04:02] and some morning between 6:00 and 9. And
[1:04:05] may we enter into that new land with
[1:04:07] those that have gone before us. Oh, what
[1:04:10] a message of shalom. We're under another
[1:04:13] sign. And the Bible says that when they
[1:04:16] shall say, "Peace and safety, then
[1:04:18] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[1:04:21] travail upon a woman with child, and
[1:04:23] they shall not escape. But ye, brethren,
[1:04:27] are not children, are [snorts] not in
[1:04:29] darkness, that that day should overtake
[1:04:31] you as a thief. Ye are all children of
[1:04:34] light, and the children of the day. Ye
[1:04:36] are not of the night or darkness. Oh my.
[1:04:41] Sometimes if you're not careful, you can
[1:04:44] read scriptures like that about sudden
[1:04:46] destruction and my it can bring a
[1:04:49] heaviness or fear. Amen. But just read
[1:04:52] the next couple verses. He said, "Ye are
[1:04:54] not of the night that that day should
[1:04:56] overtake you as a thief." He cometh as a
[1:04:59] thief in the night, but ye are not of
[1:05:01] the night. And so you won't be overtaken
[1:05:04] as a thief. Oh, praise God. But ye are
[1:05:07] children of the light. Ye are children
[1:05:09] of the day. You are of another heritage.
[1:05:12] Amen. You came from God and you're going
[1:05:14] back to God. It's a shalom message onto
[1:05:17] you. Amen. Remember what side of the
[1:05:20] promise you're on. Oh, brother Brandham
[1:05:22] saw a vision of Los Angeles going into
[1:05:25] the ocean and he comes to the message,
[1:05:27] the rapture, and he begins to tell about
[1:05:30] how Los Angeles was going to fall in the
[1:05:32] ocean. But then he says, "Before I saw
[1:05:35] that, I saw a preview of the bride." Oh
[1:05:39] my my my. Amen. What side of the
[1:05:42] prophecy are you on? Darkness is coming.
[1:05:45] Gross darkness is coming. But before he
[1:05:47] saw that, he saw me. Amen. He saw a
[1:05:51] bride that would escape tribulation.
[1:05:53] Darkness and go to be with him in glory.
[1:05:57] Oh my. We are not children of the night,
[1:05:59] but we are children of the day. We have
[1:06:02] shalom in our hearts. [snorts] And
[1:06:05] shalom is not just peace as the world
[1:06:08] calls peace. True shalom is to believe
[1:06:12] every word of God. True shalom is when
[1:06:16] you come into marriage with that word
[1:06:18] and you can say amen to every word in
[1:06:21] this Bible. That is true shalom. Amen.
[1:06:24] That is that peace that passeth all
[1:06:26] understanding when you've become united
[1:06:29] with this king of light. Amen. Brother
[1:06:32] Brandham said, "Is there one in here
[1:06:34] this morning or afternoon that doesn't
[1:06:36] have shalom, that peace, that spoke,
[1:06:38] that identified word of God, when you
[1:06:40] and the word become one?" If the Bible
[1:06:42] says one thing, you say, "No, I can't
[1:06:44] hardly believe that." That's right, then
[1:06:46] you haven't. Shalom. Amen. But when you
[1:06:48] can say amen to every word, there is a
[1:06:51] shalom in your heart because you have
[1:06:53] become united, amen, with that
[1:06:56] bridegroom, the word of God. Amen. I'm
[1:06:59] thankful for shalom.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; But what but why doesn't everyone walk
[1:07:05] in this light?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in the book of
[1:07:10] John 3,
[1:07:13] this is the condemnation
[1:07:15] that light is coming to the world and
[1:07:18] men love darkness rather than light
[1:07:20] because their deeds were evil.
[1:07:23] And brother Brandham said, "People love
[1:07:25] darkness better than they do light
[1:07:27] because darkness has a lot of pleasure."
[1:07:30] You all remember the eclipse that we
[1:07:32] just had. Was it last year or the year
[1:07:35] before on in April?
[1:07:38] And people I mean I think probably for a
[1:07:41] solid 6 months to a year before it ever
[1:07:43] happened. You'd start to see signs
[1:07:45] everywhere or people advertising their
[1:07:47] their corn fields for people to come and
[1:07:50] watch it and selling glasses. And people
[1:07:52] were traveling from all over the world
[1:07:55] to watch as that eclipse took place. And
[1:07:59] there's actually a name for those
[1:08:00] people. Amen. It's called umbrailes.
[1:08:04] And and umbraile means shadowchasers.
[1:08:08] Amen. Because the sun shines every day
[1:08:11] and the moon shines every night and they
[1:08:14] don't give it a time of day. Amen. But
[1:08:16] the minute that that that that that moon
[1:08:19] and this earth is going into shadow,
[1:08:21] they'll chase all over the world to
[1:08:23] chase a shadow. And and brother Brandham
[1:08:26] said that there's people that have
[1:08:28] receptacles to isms. Amen. That they go
[1:08:31] off in these little trails and they go
[1:08:33] into the spirit of delusion because
[1:08:36] they're following after shadows. They're
[1:08:38] following after eve lights or even
[1:08:41] brother Brandham said that Satan would
[1:08:43] come on and he would come in the form of
[1:08:45] angels of light. Amen. Amen. That's the
[1:08:48] scripture in 2 Corinthians 11. And he
[1:08:50] said, "No marvel for Satan himself is
[1:08:54] transformed into an angel of light."
[1:08:57] Satan would make himself angels of
[1:08:59] light. And he would have, Amen, those
[1:09:02] that would follow after his false light
[1:09:04] that would lead them into darkness,
[1:09:06] blind leaders of the blind. Is that
[1:09:09] right? Amen. But I'm thankful that when
[1:09:11] you can look at one thing, I I I'm a
[1:09:13] firm believer in the law of contrast
[1:09:15] that Amen. When Satan has something,
[1:09:18] it's only a perversion of the real.
[1:09:20] Amen. And I believe we're on the real
[1:09:22] side. And so there's another term called
[1:09:26] either helopiles, which is a lover of
[1:09:28] the sun, or a photoile, which is someone
[1:09:31] who loves or thrives in light.
[1:09:35] [laughter]
[1:09:35] Amen. And and
[1:09:37] uh me and Bethany, we used to live in an
[1:09:40] apartment and I there wasn't I don't
[1:09:43] think there was a single ceiling light
[1:09:44] in that whole thing. It was all just old
[1:09:47] dim lamps and this and that. And man, if
[1:09:50] there ever was a heavy spirit that would
[1:09:53] that that you'd have to fight against,
[1:09:55] it's living in a dark house all the
[1:09:57] time. And some people aren't that way.
[1:09:59] And that doesn't make you a lesser
[1:10:00] Christian, but but that's just the way
[1:10:03] we are. When we moved to our new house,
[1:10:05] there's can lights just about like this.
[1:10:07] And about every few feet there's a can
[1:10:09] light. And I I'll walk through that
[1:10:11] house and I'll just thank the Lord.
[1:10:13] Thank you, Lord, for this house. Thank
[1:10:15] you for light. [laughter] I mean, you
[1:10:17] you don't you don't know what you have
[1:10:19] until you don't have it. And I say,
[1:10:21] "Thank you for light." My brother Ray
[1:10:22] [snorts] Ericson, if you know him, he's
[1:10:25] got a saying that he says sometime. He
[1:10:26] said, "We're children of the light. Let
[1:10:28] the meter run." [laughter]
[1:10:31] Amen. Because we're children of the
[1:10:32] light. We're not meant to live in the
[1:10:34] darkness. Amen. Because we love the
[1:10:36] light. Amen. At least I do in the
[1:10:39] natural. Amen. But whether you do in the
[1:10:41] natural or not, there's something in you
[1:10:43] in the spiritual that makes you a chaser
[1:10:46] of light instead of a chaser of shadows.
[1:10:49] I mean, you're like that queen of Sheba
[1:10:51] that would go from the utmost parts of
[1:10:53] the world and to see a ministry of light
[1:10:56] that was on the earth in Solomon and
[1:10:58] behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
[1:11:01] That's why you've left houses and homes
[1:11:03] and families. That's why you've moved
[1:11:05] from other states and you've moved out
[1:11:08] of denominations because there was
[1:11:10] something in you that was chasing lie.
[1:11:12] You were like that Queen of Sheba. I
[1:11:14] mean in a greater than Solomon was here
[1:11:16] and something said, "I must get to the
[1:11:18] light. I must get out of this condition
[1:11:20] and get into the light." Oh, and I tell
[1:11:23] you something powerful, friends. It's
[1:11:26] the light that's on the inside of you
[1:11:28] that really matters. It's that seed
[1:11:30] that's on the inside of you that
[1:11:32] matters. If that inside is light, then
[1:11:34] brother or sister, I mean, there's not
[1:11:36] enough darkness that can hold you back
[1:11:38] from becoming who you are. Because
[1:11:41] brother Brandham said, Judas walked in
[1:11:43] the light. He was one of the 12
[1:11:45] disciples, but he had a dark seed. And a
[1:11:49] dark seed could walk in the light every
[1:11:51] day and never come to life. But he said
[1:11:53] that woman at the well that day, she
[1:11:56] lived in darkness, but she had a light
[1:11:59] seed on the inside of her. I say glory
[1:12:02] to God tonight. Amen. I don't care how
[1:12:04] much darkness that you are living in. If
[1:12:07] the seed inside of you is light, then
[1:12:09] that darkness can press against you as
[1:12:11] long and as hard as it wants to. But
[1:12:14] sooner or later, when the light of God's
[1:12:16] word shines across your path, that seed
[1:12:19] will flash like lightning and come to
[1:12:22] life. And it'll take you out of that
[1:12:24] darkness and plant you in the light of
[1:12:27] God's glorious word. Amen. Darkness will
[1:12:30] scatter and you will come into the
[1:12:32] message of the hour when light comes
[1:12:35] across your path and this Holy Ghost
[1:12:38] sheds light on the word.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why people don't want the
[1:12:43] Holy Ghost in their churches because
[1:12:44] it's going to shed light. And if you're
[1:12:47] following after shadows, you don't like
[1:12:49] the light. That's why you don't want the
[1:12:51] Holy Ghost to move in your church. And
[1:12:53] then because it exposes those spirits
[1:12:55] and those cockroaches that are not of
[1:12:58] the light and when that light shines on
[1:13:01] those cockroaches begin to scatter.
[1:13:04] Amen. That's why if you preach the
[1:13:06] message strong and pure and preach it
[1:13:09] anointed. Amen. It'll keep your church
[1:13:11] clean. It'll keep Amen. It'll it'll
[1:13:13] it'll press against Amen. They they
[1:13:16] Amen. They might come but they won't
[1:13:18] they won't be comfortable under that
[1:13:20] light. And sooner or later, those dark
[1:13:22] spirits will have to give way. And then
[1:13:25] sometimes it's a dark spirit. It's not a
[1:13:28] dark seed. It's just a dark cloud
[1:13:30] hanging over a light seed. That's why we
[1:13:34] preach the message because the Lord
[1:13:36] clears back the atmospheres of unbelief.
[1:13:40] That's why a son or daughter of God can
[1:13:42] come into the house of God under a cloud
[1:13:45] or under a spirit of heaviness. But the
[1:13:47] preaching of the message of the hour
[1:13:50] begins to go forth and separate the
[1:13:52] light from the darkness. And because you
[1:13:55] are of the light, amen mean you remain
[1:13:57] in the darkness has to take its leave.
[1:14:00] Amen. Because Amen. The light and
[1:14:02] darkness cannot exist together.
[1:14:05] Hallelujah. Just like in Genesis when he
[1:14:07] said, "Let there be light and there was
[1:14:08] light and then the light and darkness
[1:14:10] were divided from each other." Amen. I
[1:14:13] believe that's an example of the
[1:14:15] experience of a son or daughter of God.
[1:14:17] When this message be to cross your path,
[1:14:20] it divided the light from the darkness
[1:14:22] and separated you. Oh, brother Brandham
[1:14:25] said, "If darkness has its set time,
[1:14:27] then light must have its set time as
[1:14:29] well. And darkness may have had its time
[1:14:32] in your life, but there comes a day,
[1:14:35] amen, where the time of darkness is
[1:14:37] over. And the set time of light has come
[1:14:40] in your life. And all of a sudden, amen,
[1:14:43] something crosses your path and things
[1:14:45] are different. Oh, Gloria, I'm a
[1:14:48] witness. Amen. The woman at the well was
[1:14:51] a witness. Darkness had a set time, but
[1:14:54] when she met the master, Amen, the set
[1:14:56] time for light came in her life.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, what about Mary Magdalene? Darkness
[1:15:02] had a set time, but when she met the
[1:15:04] master,
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; light, the time for light came. Amen.
[1:15:09] We've witnessed it in our own family.
[1:15:11] I'm sure you have as well. Amen. With
[1:15:13] Bethy's testimony for about a solid
[1:15:15] year. There was some dark moments. There
[1:15:18] was some dark times. Amen. As things
[1:15:21] didn't look so good, Amen. in her in her
[1:15:23] body and the things she was fighting.
[1:15:25] Amen. But all of a sudden, God can come
[1:15:27] on the scene and turn on the light.
[1:15:30] Amen. And you'll look back and say, "We
[1:15:32] aren't where we used to be." Amen. We're
[1:15:34] walking in light. We're walking in
[1:15:36] victory. We're walking in the promise.
[1:15:39] We're walking in the fulfillment because
[1:15:42] light is manifested word. Amen. And God
[1:15:45] may have a promise, but sooner or later
[1:15:47] that promise is going to come to pass
[1:15:50] and you'll be walking in the light of
[1:15:52] his word. Amen. But ye are a chosen
[1:15:55] generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
[1:15:58] nation, a peculiar people, that ye
[1:16:00] should show forth the praises of him who
[1:16:03] hath called you out of darkness into his
[1:16:06] marvelous light. Ephesians 5:8, for ye
[1:16:10] were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
[1:16:12] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[1:16:15] light. Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time that we walk as children
[1:16:19] of light. And I say we have light to
[1:16:22] walk in. Amen. Psalm says, "Thy word is
[1:16:26] a lamp unto our feet and a light unto
[1:16:29] our path." Second Peter 1 says, "We have
[1:16:32] also a more sure word of prophecy, where
[1:16:34] unto you do well that you take heed as
[1:16:37] unto a light that shineth in a dark
[1:16:40] place until the day dawn in the day star
[1:16:43] arise in your hearts." Amen. this
[1:16:46] message as it begin to come and be
[1:16:49] manifested.
[1:16:51] It was the day star arising in our
[1:16:54] hearts. It was the rising of the sun
[1:16:57] shining light upon our past that we
[1:17:00] might walk in the light. Brother
[1:17:02] Brandham said to my precious dear
[1:17:04] brothers and sisters, to all of you as a
[1:17:06] servant of God, I never said this before
[1:17:08] in the world in this church. I never
[1:17:10] said, but as a prophet of the Lord, I
[1:17:12] say unto you, this is the light. Walk ye
[1:17:16] in it. [laughter]
[1:17:17] Oh my. This is the light. Walk ye in it.
[1:17:21] This message is the light. And he said,
[1:17:23] "Your Baptist light won't work anymore."
[1:17:26] Amen. None of those other lights, your
[1:17:28] Campbell lights, your Russell lights,
[1:17:30] none of your church lights will work
[1:17:32] anymore. He said, "This is the light.
[1:17:34] Walk ye in it." Amen. And when the word
[1:17:36] is manifested, it becomes light. And you
[1:17:39] don't have to question it anymore. As
[1:17:42] long as it lays there without
[1:17:43] fulfillment, you might question what
[1:17:46] does this mean? What's it going to be?
[1:17:47] But once it happens, it's light. Amen.
[1:17:50] Just like you might have wondered. Amen.
[1:17:52] What was that? What will that beautiful
[1:17:54] woman be? And that brother Brandham saw.
[1:17:56] Amen. But we had a woman come and she
[1:17:59] was sworn into office in royal purple.
[1:18:02] Amen. We don't have to walk in confusion
[1:18:04] anymore. We can walk in the light of
[1:18:06] fulfillment that what the prophet spoke
[1:18:08] about has come to pass. Amen. of the
[1:18:10] Catholic Church. Amen. Is in position. I
[1:18:13] mean, it's coming to pass. I mean, we
[1:18:15] don't have to walk in darkness of will
[1:18:17] the American pope, what will he be?
[1:18:20] We're walking in light now because it's
[1:18:22] come to pass. It's been manifested. And
[1:18:24] as this message has has come, Amen.
[1:18:28] since the message began, it's just been
[1:18:30] like somebody walking through the house
[1:18:31] and flipping on a switch and flipping on
[1:18:34] a switch and flipping on a switch and
[1:18:36] flipping on a switch and before you know
[1:18:38] it, the whole house is illuminated with
[1:18:41] the vindicated word of God. Amen. That's
[1:18:44] why we can say this is the light walking
[1:18:46] in it. Amen. We're not living in a dark
[1:18:48] room anymore. We are living in the
[1:18:50] vindication of the word of God that has
[1:18:53] shed light upon our past. And it's
[1:18:56] walking time. We don't have to be scared
[1:18:58] to walk in Mark 11. We don't have to be
[1:19:00] scared to walk in Mark 16. We don't have
[1:19:03] to be scared to walk in any of the
[1:19:06] promises of God. Amen. Because it has
[1:19:09] shown light upon our path to walk in it.
[1:19:13] Sometimes
[1:19:14] you might be like that man walking with
[1:19:16] that lantern. You may not know what
[1:19:18] comes after the next step, but if you
[1:19:20] just keep walking with this message, I
[1:19:22] mean, it will continue to shine light
[1:19:25] upon your path all the way until we get
[1:19:28] home. Amen. Every word in this Bible,
[1:19:31] every promise will come to light. Every
[1:19:34] son or daughter of God that has a seed
[1:19:36] inside of them will come to light. Amen.
[1:19:39] It's it's not a glare of another age. It
[1:19:43] is the light for this age. Amen. because
[1:19:47] we're not living in the light of God
[1:19:48] sent a prophet anymore.
[1:19:51] Just like when John was here, Jesus
[1:19:54] would say, "He was a burning and a
[1:19:56] shining light. [laughter] And ye were
[1:19:58] willing for a season to rejoice in his
[1:20:00] light, but I have greater witness than
[1:20:02] that of John." And John would say, "I
[1:20:05] must decrease, but he must increase." I
[1:20:08] mean, it went from the light of John
[1:20:10] until the light of the son, Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ. And now we're not just living in
[1:20:14] the light of God centered prophet. We've
[1:20:16] moved into Amen. Jesus Christ has come
[1:20:20] to manifest himself through a bride.
[1:20:23] Amen. This is the light. It's it's a
[1:20:25] continuation of Christ. Amen. [snorts]
[1:20:28] It doesn't do away with any It doesn't
[1:20:30] do away with the evening star. Amen. But
[1:20:33] the sun is here. Amen. This evening star
[1:20:36] was introducing to us. Amen. The sun is
[1:20:39] rising. Jesus Christ is here on the
[1:20:41] scene. Amen. Have you recognized his
[1:20:44] presence? Amen. The presence of the sun
[1:20:46] has returned. That's why we can say it's
[1:20:49] time to shine.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham said,
[1:20:55] "Oh, you morning stars, rise and shine."
[1:20:58] He said, "It's [clears throat] time to
[1:20:59] shine. The coming of the Lord is at
[1:21:02] hand." In the message shalom, he said,
[1:21:05] "As I feel the mortal blood pouring
[1:21:07] through my body, I feel the surge of the
[1:21:10] Holy Ghost coming behind it. Rise and
[1:21:13] shine,
[1:21:14] brother. Something said, "Billy Brandom,
[1:21:16] you're getting old. You're getting weak.
[1:21:18] Your shoulders are drooping. Your hair
[1:21:19] is turning gray and falling out." That's
[1:21:21] right. And darkness and gross darkness
[1:21:24] upon the earth. He said, "But rise and
[1:21:27] shine. I feel falling there the surge of
[1:21:30] light of the glorious gospel of Jesus
[1:21:32] Christ, which has made me a new creature
[1:21:35] in him." Amen. Brother Brand would cry
[1:21:37] out, "Rise and shine. It's time for this
[1:21:40] bride to shine." Amen. I It may be
[1:21:43] darker out in the world than it's ever
[1:21:45] been. Amen. But it's time for the bride.
[1:21:47] Amen. The morning star church to rise
[1:21:50] and shine. Amen. Noah shined in his day.
[1:21:53] Moses shined in his day. But we're not
[1:21:56] living in the light of Moses any longer.
[1:21:58] But it's time for the bride to rise and
[1:22:01] shine. Amen. It's time. Amen. For the
[1:22:03] children to come into the position where
[1:22:06] we know who we are. And it's time for
[1:22:08] the preachers to preach. It's time for
[1:22:10] the singers to sing. It's time for the
[1:22:13] young people and to be real young people
[1:22:15] and the elders to be real elders. It's
[1:22:17] time. It's adoption time. It's morning
[1:22:20] star time. It's manifesting time. It's
[1:22:24] time where we can break through every
[1:22:25] cloud. Amen. We can break through every
[1:22:28] every cloud, every confusion, every
[1:22:30] condemnation. Amen. Because and brother
[1:22:33] Brandham said he would go, I believe it
[1:22:34] was to the church in the mornings and he
[1:22:37] would hear and the bird begin to sing
[1:22:40] and that bird was a night and gale. And
[1:22:42] he said that night and gale only sings.
[1:22:45] He don't sing until he sees and mean
[1:22:47] that star appear. And that star
[1:22:49] appearing is a proof that the sun is
[1:22:52] still shining. Amen. Because as long as
[1:22:54] that night and gale can see that star
[1:22:57] and it's shining in the sky, it shows
[1:22:58] that there is still light. that the sun
[1:23:01] is still somewhere shining. And that
[1:23:03] night andale is the first one to
[1:23:05] announce that the break of day is
[1:23:07] coming. And we had a night and gale that
[1:23:09] stood in the tower. Amen. Our prophet
[1:23:12] which would announce unto us. Amen. The
[1:23:14] rising of the sun. Daybreak is coming.
[1:23:18] Morning is coming. It's time to rise and
[1:23:20] shine. Just like those slaves under that
[1:23:23] emancipation proclamation. Amen. the
[1:23:26] first one at the top of the hill could
[1:23:28] announce at Daybreak. It's time to go
[1:23:31] free. We can throw down our pitchforks.
[1:23:33] We can throw down our our tools and we
[1:23:36] can go free. You know that that
[1:23:38] Emancipation Proclamation. I just found
[1:23:40] this out last night at church. It was it
[1:23:43] was signed on January 1st in 1863.
[1:23:48] President Abraham Lincoln signed the
[1:23:49] Emancipation Proclamation. Amen. That
[1:23:52] the slaves could go free at the
[1:23:54] appointed time. Amen. And so in the
[1:23:58] spiritual as God sent us, Amen. A
[1:24:01] prophet that has announced that we can
[1:24:03] go free. Amen. [snorts] That Amen. that
[1:24:05] the surge of the Holy Ghost that has
[1:24:07] come into this last age can begin to
[1:24:10] push the clouds away from your life.
[1:24:14] Amen. And you can realize that the sun
[1:24:17] is rising and daybreak is coming. Amen.
[1:24:20] Even though you may not see the sun,
[1:24:22] sometimes you have to look with the eyes
[1:24:24] of faith because the eyes of sight might
[1:24:26] only see darkness. But this but but
[1:24:29] faith looks and sees the sun shining
[1:24:32] behind the clouds and announces, amen,
[1:24:35] that the sun is still here. Amen.
[1:24:37] Declaring we are free. We are free. We
[1:24:41] are free. It's a proclamation over the
[1:24:43] church. Amen. Amen. We are free. Amen.
[1:24:46] We are free. Amen. Just like when that
[1:24:49] when that sun rose in Genesis.
[1:24:53] Amen. As that sun begin to rise and he
[1:24:55] say, "Let there be light." And there was
[1:24:57] light, it began to draw the botany life
[1:25:00] out of the earth and bring it to life.
[1:25:02] Amen. So the rising of the sun in this
[1:25:04] age has done more than bring botney
[1:25:07] life, but it has brought life of sons
[1:25:09] and daughters out of the earth and drawn
[1:25:12] you onto itself. Amen. It's the rising
[1:25:15] of the sun. Amen. It's resurrection
[1:25:18] time. You say, "Well, it's it's the
[1:25:21] middle of winter. It's not it's not
[1:25:22] Easter." But do you know that that the
[1:25:26] that that that New Year's used to always
[1:25:28] be in April and that time of year in the
[1:25:32] the Julian calendar, Julius calendar,
[1:25:35] whatever it was, the new year was
[1:25:37] actually in April or March, that time of
[1:25:40] year. And it wasn't until the 1500s when
[1:25:43] the Gregorian calendar came in that it
[1:25:46] changed it into January. And that's
[1:25:48] actually where April Fools comes from
[1:25:50] because some people didn't know that it
[1:25:52] had switched. So they were celebrating
[1:25:54] New Year's at different times, but it
[1:25:56] had changed from April until January.
[1:25:59] Just like the Bible would talk in the
[1:26:01] first Exodus how when they were coming
[1:26:03] out, it said, "This month shall be unto
[1:26:05] you the beginning of months." When did
[1:26:07] they go in an Exodus? It was in the
[1:26:10] springtime that they went into an
[1:26:11] Exodus. It was when Amen. the Jordan was
[1:26:14] high. [laughter] It was the flooding
[1:26:15] period. It was the springtime, but it
[1:26:17] was the beginning of months. Amen.
[1:26:19] That's why we can say, amen, it's a new
[1:26:22] year's onto the believer. Amen. That has
[1:26:24] been resurrected under the light of this
[1:26:26] message. Amen. You have entered into a
[1:26:29] new year. You've entered into a new day.
[1:26:32] I mean, this word has separated you from
[1:26:34] the darkness and set you into the light
[1:26:37] of this glorious gospel. It's the
[1:26:39] dawning of a new day for every believer
[1:26:42] who has received this message of the
[1:26:44] hour. Amen. Shalom. Good morning onto
[1:26:47] you. Amen. Amen. This is the
[1:26:50] condemnation. Amen. The scripture would
[1:26:52] say how men, Amen, who were for ordained
[1:26:55] on condemnation, right? And John 3 says,
[1:26:58] "This is the condemnation that light is
[1:27:00] coming to the world and men love
[1:27:02] darkness rather than light because their
[1:27:04] deeds were evil."
[1:27:06] This is the condemnation.
[1:27:09] Condemnation to those who have refused
[1:27:11] to walk in this light. But this is not
[1:27:14] our condemnation.
[1:27:16] This is our resurrection.
[1:27:19] Because the Bible said in Genesis 13,
[1:27:21] Abraham, thy seed shall be like the
[1:27:23] dust. And then in Genesis 15, it said,
[1:27:26] Abraham, your seed shall be like the
[1:27:28] stars. Brother Brandon said, watch that.
[1:27:31] It's the resurrection from the dust to
[1:27:33] the stars. Oh my. Isn't that what God
[1:27:36] has done for you, Brother Brian? Isn't
[1:27:39] that what God has done for you? Isn't
[1:27:41] that what God has done for all of us?
[1:27:43] Resurrected us from the dust to the
[1:27:45] stars. God has called his church from
[1:27:48] the dust to the stars. Amen. Just like
[1:27:51] brother Brandham said,
[1:27:53] it's like that dew drop in the nighttime
[1:27:57] when you walk out and that sun begins to
[1:27:59] set, that dude begins to fall. He said
[1:28:03] he was once in the sky, but when the
[1:28:06] absence of that sun, he fell down to the
[1:28:09] earth. Oh, but when that sun rose again,
[1:28:12] that dew drop would begin to evaporate
[1:28:14] right back to where he came from. Oh my,
[1:28:18] you came from God.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And you're going back to God in the
[1:28:23] absence of the sun. We had to bypass our
[1:28:26] theophanes to come down into this earth
[1:28:28] and live here in this human humble
[1:28:31] vessel. But when this message began to
[1:28:33] arise upon your lives and you [snorts]
[1:28:36] recognized it as eagle's food and you
[1:28:37] heard from your theophony, it be to
[1:28:40] resurrect you right back to where you
[1:28:42] came from. Amen. It's a message. Arise,
[1:28:45] shine. Thy light has come.
[1:28:49] Amen. As we enter into this new year, I
[1:28:51] say, God, let us rise like never before.
[1:28:54] Let us stand like never before. The
[1:28:57] Bible says in Revelations 2:24 to the
[1:29:00] Thotyron church, "He that overcomemeth
[1:29:03] and keepeth my works unto the end, till
[1:29:05] him will I give power over the nations,
[1:29:08] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:29:09] iron, as the vessels of a potter shall
[1:29:11] they be broken to shivers, even as I
[1:29:13] receive to my father, and I will give
[1:29:16] him the morning star."
[1:29:19] Brother Bram said, "The brightest thing
[1:29:21] in heaven is an overcomer." That was the
[1:29:24] reward to the Thotyron church. I will
[1:29:26] give him a morning star. He said that's
[1:29:28] the brightest thing in heaven, an
[1:29:30] overcomer. Those that have overcome
[1:29:34] their thoughts, those that have overcome
[1:29:36] the world, those in the darkest hour
[1:29:37] that are overcoming. And he'll make us
[1:29:40] morning stars to shine forever and ever.
[1:29:43] Paul said, "I fought a good fight. I
[1:29:45] finished my course. I've kept the faith.
[1:29:48] Henceforth, there is laid up for me a
[1:29:49] crown of righteousness which the Lord,
[1:29:52] the righteous judge, shall give me at
[1:29:54] that day." And then [snorts] brother
[1:29:55] Brandon said, "Then he thought of the
[1:29:57] morning stars coming." And he said, "And
[1:30:01] not to me only, but unto all them also
[1:30:05] that love is appearing."
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I want to be an overcomer.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're not going to overcome in
[1:30:13] our own selves, but we'll overcome by
[1:30:15] the blood of the lamb
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; and the word of the testimony. Because
[1:30:18] brother Brandham said, "What's the
[1:30:20] matter? The latter and for rain, former
[1:30:22] reign is coming together. The morning
[1:30:25] stars are being polished by the blood of
[1:30:27] Jesus Christ.
[1:30:29] 1 John 1:7, "But if we walk in the light
[1:30:32] as he is in the light, we have
[1:30:34] fellowship one with another, and the
[1:30:37] blood of Jesus Christ, his son,
[1:30:39] cleanseth us from all sin."
[1:30:43] You know, there was a time, Brother Bram
[1:30:44] tells it in the message, turn on the
[1:30:46] light, that there was a factory and they
[1:30:49] were a paper making factory
[1:30:52] and and and I believe it was the queen
[1:30:54] walked in there and she said, "What what
[1:30:56] is this? I want to see how this process
[1:30:58] works. I want to know how you make this
[1:31:01] wonderful paper. I It's beautiful paper.
[1:31:04] It's so clear and so so perfect that you
[1:31:07] can see your reflection in it." and and
[1:31:09] and she saw in the one room she said,
[1:31:12] "What is this pile of dirty rags?" And
[1:31:15] she said, "This is yesterday's
[1:31:17] clothes that we've gathered together.
[1:31:19] These are all dirty clothes that we've
[1:31:21] gathered." He said, "I don't understand.
[1:31:23] I don't understand the process. I don't
[1:31:25] understand how it works." He said, "Just
[1:31:27] hold on. Tomorrow you'll understand."
[1:31:29] And they would take those dirty clothes
[1:31:32] old rags and they would begin to process
[1:31:35] them and process them through each
[1:31:37] stage. And when those rags came out,
[1:31:40] they held up this piece of paper before
[1:31:42] the queen and said, "Look at this." And
[1:31:44] the queen looked at that paper and she
[1:31:47] saw her reflection in the paper of what
[1:31:50] was yesterday's old dirty clothes had
[1:31:53] become a reflection of the queen. And
[1:31:57] brother Brandon would begin to tell us
[1:31:59] how, I mean, how we have come through
[1:32:02] the process of justification and
[1:32:04] sanctification. We've come through all
[1:32:06] the ages, but now God is taking us and
[1:32:09] polishing us, our dirty rags, until he
[1:32:12] can see his reflection in his own bride.
[1:32:16] Amen. Those who have ate the book and
[1:32:18] digested it, you have become a reflector
[1:32:22] for Jesus Christ.
[1:32:25] You might have been dismal for a few
[1:32:27] days.
[1:32:28] Brother [snorts] Brandhamstead,
[1:32:30] may these morning stars that may have
[1:32:32] been dismal for a few days. They think
[1:32:34] the revival is dying out, that's just
[1:32:36] exactly what you said would take place,
[1:32:37] gross darkness, but the morning star
[1:32:40] would reflect the light. He that
[1:32:41] overcomemeth, I'll give him a morning
[1:32:44] star.
[1:32:46] Amen. As the musicians come tonight,
[1:32:49] Amen. That's what we're looking for
[1:32:51] tonight.
[1:32:53] I'm looking for that morning star.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm looking for morning stars this
[1:33:00] this evening. I'm I'm looking for those
[1:33:03] Brother Bram said, "You devils that's
[1:33:05] trying to hold these morning stars,
[1:33:08] trying to smoke up their life, they're
[1:33:11] rising and filling their lamps and
[1:33:13] trimming them, setting them a fire with
[1:33:16] new faith." In another place, he says,
[1:33:18] "You once seemed like you were called
[1:33:21] for a morning star, but you've been down
[1:33:24] in the smoke and it's got your lights
[1:33:27] all smoked out. The Holy Spirit can
[1:33:29] shine against you and yet you're so
[1:33:31] dull. You sit and say, "I'm too tired.
[1:33:34] I've been in meetings before. I don't
[1:33:36] know." He said, "Oh, what a miserable
[1:33:38] person you are."
[1:33:39] Let the blood of Jesus Christ wash your
[1:33:42] soul, friend, that you might reflect the
[1:33:44] light of the son of God.
[1:33:49] Amen. How many wants to be a morning
[1:33:50] star tonight? And as you stand to your
[1:33:53] feet with me, I'm thankful for a blood
[1:33:56] that can polish a morning star because I
[1:33:59] believe that's what this message has
[1:34:01] come was to call the morning stars out
[1:34:04] and show them, I mean, that you can
[1:34:07] reflect me. And but sometimes you it may
[1:34:10] look like you're not a morning star
[1:34:13] because you've got so you've got so just
[1:34:17] covered in the dust of the world and
[1:34:19] covered in the smoke of the world and
[1:34:22] you say, "I'm not a morning star. I'm so
[1:34:24] dim." But that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:34:27] Christ was here to do. You begin to wash
[1:34:30] yourself in that blood and it begins to
[1:34:32] polish
[1:34:33] morning stars to reflect his presence.
[1:34:36] Amen. Can we bow our heads tonight?
[1:34:40] I mean, I'm looking for morning stars
[1:34:42] tonight.
[1:34:43] You say, "Well, Brother Samuel, he's a
[1:34:46] morning star." Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's easy
[1:34:49] to see.
[1:34:51] It's easy to see the bright stars. It's
[1:34:54] easy to see their morning stars.
[1:34:57] But I'm looking for that dismal one.
[1:35:00] I'm looking for that one that is walking
[1:35:03] in that dimness and condemnation and
[1:35:06] complexes.
[1:35:07] I'm looking for that one that's been
[1:35:09] walking in sin and says, "I just don't
[1:35:12] know if I can take another year. I just
[1:35:15] don't know if I can go any farther. I
[1:35:18] just don't know if I can ever live this
[1:35:19] message."
[1:35:21] That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking
[1:35:23] for those morning stars to let you know
[1:35:26] that there is a blood powerful enough to
[1:35:28] polish you and let you reflect Jesus
[1:35:32] Christ today. You know, Brother Brandham
[1:35:33] went into that insane asylum one time
[1:35:37] and there was people butting their heads
[1:35:39] against walls and there was people doing
[1:35:41] every kind of thing and moaning and
[1:35:43] groaning and there was a a a beautiful
[1:35:46] little girl sitting there and he said,
[1:35:49] you know, he he's just walking around
[1:35:51] and the the lady asked him, "Can I help
[1:35:53] you, sir?" And he said, "Well, I just
[1:35:55] don't know what to do. I don't know
[1:35:56] where to start." And he said, "Well,
[1:35:59] perhaps, sir, you could start with me."
[1:36:02] And he said, "My surely you're not a
[1:36:04] patient here. Surely you're not uh here
[1:36:07] because of some condition." And she
[1:36:09] said, "Yeah,
[1:36:11] she had had a rough life. She had gotten
[1:36:12] into some serious trouble." And I
[1:36:15] believe it was a boy had slipped some
[1:36:17] pills into her drink and something like
[1:36:19] that and had ruined her life and she had
[1:36:23] slipped into a life of darkness.
[1:36:26] But she said, "Brother Brandham, start
[1:36:28] with me." And he g he he began to deal
[1:36:30] with her life and deal with her and say,
[1:36:34] "It's the devil making you do those
[1:36:36] things.
[1:36:37] It was the devil that that would cause
[1:36:39] you to do those things. Don't you want
[1:36:41] to be a mother? Don't you want to be a
[1:36:43] wife?" And she say, "Sure, I do." But
[1:36:45] she couldn't maybe see how it's possible
[1:36:47] at the time. But brother Brandham began
[1:36:49] to deal with her. She began to recognize
[1:36:52] that there was a a place where she could
[1:36:55] give her life to Jesus. And brother
[1:36:57] Brandham said that he can take you back
[1:37:00] to the time when you was a virgin
[1:37:01] innocent girl. The blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:04] is sufficient and powerful to transform
[1:37:07] the violent sinner to a bloodwashed
[1:37:10] saint, guiltless before God. And she
[1:37:13] began to pray and pray and she said she
[1:37:15] felt like she was turning a new leaf.
[1:37:17] And brother Bram said, "No, not yet.
[1:37:19] Hold on a while." And just a little
[1:37:21] while longer, something slipped into
[1:37:23] that room that changed her life forever.
[1:37:27] And she said, "Now she's married and
[1:37:28] she's got a family because she didn't
[1:37:31] just turn a new leaf to go back to the
[1:37:34] same life, but she met a living God and
[1:37:37] got under a blood that polished her and
[1:37:40] took her back to the time when she was a
[1:37:42] virgin, innocent girl." Amen. And then
[1:37:44] you may not be in that condition
[1:37:45] tonight, but come into into this new
[1:37:48] year, you may feel like you're not
[1:37:50] shining the way that you should be. And
[1:37:51] you say, you say, "Lord Jesus, I want
[1:37:54] you to start with me tonight. Lord, if
[1:37:56] there's only one onre revival in my
[1:37:58] family, start with me. If there's only
[1:38:01] one on revival in this church, set me a
[1:38:03] fire, Lord, and start with me." Amen.
[1:38:06] Says, Amen. If that's your desire
[1:38:07] tonight,
[1:38:09] start with me, Lord Jesus.
[1:38:12] Polish me Lord by your blood. I want to
[1:38:14] shine for you. Amen. Heavenly Father, we
[1:38:18] thank you for your mercy and your grace.
[1:38:20] We thank you for the message. Shalom,
[1:38:23] Father, that Lord, we're coming to a
[1:38:25] year 2026. We don't know what today
[1:38:28] holds. We don't know what tomorrow
[1:38:29] holds, but we know who holds tomorrow.
[1:38:32] That's why, like the prophet said, as
[1:38:33] we're coming to a new year, we're just
[1:38:36] going to put our hand in yours and trust
[1:38:38] you, Lord, that you know what the future
[1:38:40] holds. and you hold our future. And so
[1:38:43] we believe, Lord, that our future is
[1:38:45] bright, Father. No matter how many dark
[1:38:48] days we go through, Lord, we believe
[1:38:50] that there's a light that's been lit on
[1:38:53] the inside of our hearts that'll carry
[1:38:56] us through the darkest of days. And
[1:38:58] Father, I pray that your blood would
[1:38:59] begin to polish every morning star this
[1:39:02] evening. Maybe there's even one on the
[1:39:04] phone hookup or the live stream. Father,
[1:39:07] Lord, who's under those clouds of
[1:39:09] condemnation and fear and complexes,
[1:39:13] Father, I pray you begin to polish them
[1:39:15] under your blood and let them know that
[1:39:17] they can be a morning star. Father, that
[1:39:20] they can shine brighter than they ever
[1:39:22] have before. Lord, we commit this year
[1:39:25] into your hands. We commit this life,
[1:39:27] this next year, all of our lives, all
[1:39:29] that we are into your hands. [music]
[1:39:31] have your way. I pray in Jesus name.
[1:39:34] Amen. And amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead, brother. God bless you
[1:39:38] saints. We love you.
