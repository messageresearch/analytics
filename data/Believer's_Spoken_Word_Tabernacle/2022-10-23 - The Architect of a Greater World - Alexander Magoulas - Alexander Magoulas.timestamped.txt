[39:07] we'll look into the word of God this
[39:09] this morning and this afternoon as well
[39:11] our gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[39:13] thankful that as the eagle stirs The
[39:16] Nest so you're stirring up this bride
[39:18] Lord You've not made us for this world
[39:21] but for a greater World which is to come
[39:24] Lord the greatness of that world to come
[39:26] it eclipses and it exceeds anything that
[39:29] this world could offer us Lord
[39:31] we look at the times and the conditions
[39:34] of the world today and Lord I'm let our
[39:37] meditation not be upon the things that
[39:39] are but the things which are to be
[39:42] knowing that you've gone to prepare a
[39:44] place that you've made plans for us
[39:46] you've got plans for this bride today
[39:48] you've not ordained us unto wrath into a
[39:51] tribulation but you've ordained us unto
[39:53] life to obtain salvation through Jesus
[39:56] Christ
[39:57] and Lord we're so thankful today as We
[39:59] Gather here may our thoughts turn
[40:01] towards things which are Heavenly today
[40:03] things which are true things which are
[40:05] pure pure which are of good report let
[40:07] us meditate upon things above today as
[40:09] we look into the word of God may you
[40:11] open the scripture to us and break the
[40:13] bread of life to us once again even as
[40:16] you did the disciples there on the road
[40:17] to Emmaus and father in this service
[40:20] there's many needs in the people today
[40:22] father needs that I is a man I'm unaware
[40:25] of and perhaps we ourselves are even
[40:27] unaware at times of what we need in our
[40:30] own lives but we're so mindful that and
[40:31] we're so thankful that the Creator is
[40:33] mindful of us
[40:35] you know the creation you're the Potter
[40:38] and we're just the clay today Lord have
[40:40] your way in this place and shape us and
[40:42] mold us as vessels of Honor unto you
[40:45] unto your great glory and praise and we
[40:47] thank you now may there not be a one
[40:49] walk out of here needing today but may
[40:51] they receive the that what you have need
[40:52] of is Boaz left for roots so may you
[40:55] drop something for each one today I mean
[40:58] we go to this place rejoicing in the
[41:00] full Assurance of our Salvation if we
[41:03] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[41:04] name amen and God bless you if you have
[41:07] your Bibles today
[41:09] we'll be looking at the book of Nehemiah
[41:11] the second chapter I just spoke here a
[41:13] few weeks ago and I was talking about uh
[41:15] the hero of a greater world and
[41:18] contrasting the idea that
[41:20] that it's a greater world than this one
[41:22] you know there are certain things that
[41:24] Christ is doing and he fulfills in our
[41:27] life now that he you know there'll be no
[41:29] need for a Healer in a greater world
[41:31] Amen he's the Healer now but in that
[41:33] world there won't be need for real he
[41:34] will all be whole amen there'll be no
[41:36] sickness there'll be no mind battles
[41:39] there'll be no crying or weeping for the
[41:41] former things they're all passed away
[41:43] amen so we want to really meditate upon
[41:45] this greater world because the beginning
[41:47] Christ is the first fruits of the new
[41:50] creation
[41:51] and we are the same we're the children
[41:53] we're the Church of the firstborn and so
[41:55] creation the new creation is already in
[41:57] The Believer today and so we want to
[41:59] look here in the book of Nehemiah the
[42:00] second chapter
[42:02] and uh we'll start in verse 10. uh just
[42:05] to preface this for those that aren't
[42:07] familiar with it of course Nehemiah has
[42:08] the King has has uh has approached him
[42:12] about his concern about Jerusalem and he
[42:14] spoke he prayed and he spoke to the king
[42:16] and the Kings give him leave to go back
[42:18] to Jerusalem and he's also given him
[42:20] leave to procure whatever he needs for
[42:22] his journey and so that he's found great
[42:24] favor in the sight of the king and this
[42:25] is a pretty tremendous thing of itself
[42:27] and so he's fixing to go back to
[42:30] Jerusalem because he's heard about the
[42:31] condition of it being destroyed and run
[42:33] down and I I I was going to start in
[42:36] verse 11 but I want to start in verse 10
[42:38] because I want to talk about the
[42:39] opposition for just a moment that he
[42:41] encountered and the Bible says here when
[42:43] Samba the horror night and tobiah the
[42:45] servant the ammonite heard it it grieved
[42:48] them exceedingly that there was come a
[42:50] man to seek the welfare of the children
[42:53] of Israel it really bothered somebody
[42:55] cared about God's people
[42:57] and grieve them exceedly there's a man
[42:59] that's come to turn on the light
[43:02] there's a man that's come to help God's
[43:03] people I'm already moving around I
[43:04] haven't finished my text
[43:06] it really bothered them yeah they were
[43:08] really disappointed somebody wants to
[43:10] help out God's people I say let them be
[43:12] disappointed
[43:14] us and human just get as mad as he wants
[43:16] because there's a man here that can turn
[43:18] on light God has come down to help this
[43:20] people today in this generation amen God
[43:22] sent a man back then and God has sent us
[43:25] a message today
[43:29] I'm so mad as much frustration as much
[43:32] trouble as I've had in my life I hope to
[43:34] revisit that upon him just a little bit
[43:38] praise the Lord and grieve them here
[43:41] comes somebody to help God's people the
[43:44] children of Israel
[43:45] so Nehemiah shows up verse 11 so I came
[43:48] to Jerusalem and was there three days
[43:50] and I arose in the night I and some few
[43:53] men with me neither told I any man what
[43:56] my God had put in my heart to do it
[43:59] Jerusalem
[44:01] neither was there any peace with me save
[44:03] the Beast that I wrote upon
[44:07] this all day amen there's one Beast
[44:09] carrying him and I went out by night
[44:11] by the gate of the valley even before
[44:14] the dragon well into the dung port and
[44:16] viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were
[44:18] broken down and the gates thereof were
[44:21] consumed with fire then I went on to the
[44:23] gate of the fountain and to the king's
[44:26] pool but there was no place for the
[44:28] Beast that was under me to pass pretty
[44:30] bad situation
[44:31] then I went up to the night but in the
[44:34] Night by the Brook and viewed the wall
[44:36] and turned back and entered by the gate
[44:38] of the valley and so returned and the
[44:40] rulers knew not whether I went or what I
[44:43] did neither had I as yet told it to the
[44:46] Jews nor to the priests nor to the
[44:48] Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest
[44:50] that did the work
[44:52] then said I unto them ye see the
[44:55] distress
[44:56] that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste
[45:00] and the gates thereof are burned with
[45:02] fire come and let us build up the wall
[45:05] of Jerusalem that we be no more a
[45:09] reproach then I told them of the hand of
[45:13] my God which was good upon me as also
[45:16] the king's words that he had spoken unto
[45:18] me and then he said let us rise up
[45:21] and build so they strengthened their
[45:24] hands for this good work may the Lord
[45:27] bless the reading of his word you may be
[45:29] seated today
[45:35] so if I could continue kind of with the
[45:37] thought I had from last time talking
[45:38] about the hero of a greater World I'd
[45:40] like to speak today and I think it's I
[45:42] just love how the songs come together
[45:43] and everything I'd like to speak today
[45:45] about the architect of a greater world
[45:48] the architect of a greater world and you
[45:51] know as I was meditating on this and
[45:53] looking at this one of the things that I
[45:54] was thinking about is you know many
[45:56] times the carnally minded people they
[45:58] often ask the question they look at the
[46:00] world and the condition it's in today
[46:02] and they look at it and say well if God
[46:04] is good and he made everything why is
[46:07] the world so bad you know why is there
[46:09] homelessness and and sickness and
[46:11] starvation and depression and every evil
[46:14] work if he's a righteous God why does it
[46:17] permit so much evil if he's a loving God
[46:19] why does he send people to hell but I
[46:22] want you to remember that they are there
[46:24] the Bible says they're willingly
[46:25] ignorant amen they look at these things
[46:28] and they want to criticize but they're
[46:29] ignorant of the whole purpose and plan
[46:31] of God we're living in the end times we
[46:33] just talked about the whole world's
[46:35] falling apart it's falling into a place
[46:37] of judgment just exactly according to
[46:39] the scripture it's not that God didn't
[46:41] foresee it it's all part of God's plan
[46:43] it was it was ordained to do this he's
[46:46] foretold it we see clearly you think
[46:48] about it as Believers we can look at the
[46:50] world condition we clearly identify it
[46:52] they scratched their head they mock God
[46:54] they make fun of it and you and I we
[46:56] read this Bible and we literally see
[46:58] scripture coming to pass day after day
[47:00] we see the things that Prophet spoke
[47:02] about being fulfilled and the world
[47:04] doesn't even see it it's right there in
[47:06] black and white it's right there on tape
[47:10] and the World At Large they walk in
[47:12] their own lusts and the Bible says they
[47:13] scoff and say where is the promise of
[47:15] his coming for since the fathers all
[47:18] things continue as they had before but
[47:20] the Bible says for this they're
[47:21] willingly ignorant
[47:23] amen they're willingly injured that by
[47:25] the word of God the heavens were of old
[47:28] and the Earth standing out of the water
[47:30] and in the water whereby the worlds that
[47:32] were then they were overflowed and they
[47:33] perished amen but the heavens and earth
[47:36] which are now by the same word they are
[47:39] kept in store reserved unto fire
[47:43] against the day of judgment and the
[47:45] Perdition of ungodly men so in other
[47:48] words the world's in the condition is in
[47:49] today because the very same word that
[47:51] upholds it is the very same word that is
[47:53] reserved it for judgment
[47:56] so they can look at these things coming
[47:58] to pass and they scoff but you and I are
[48:00] not ignorant that the answer why is the
[48:02] world in the condition it's in today why
[48:04] are things so evil and bad in the world
[48:06] today it's not because of the design of
[48:08] God
[48:09] do they want to blame God but God's with
[48:11] the architect of this Eden amen his
[48:14] eating was a different design it had a
[48:16] different Foundation it had a different
[48:17] purpose amen but this this Eden we're in
[48:20] now it's Satan's Eden it is the
[48:22] perversion of the design of God
[48:25] because I want to remind you that Satan
[48:27] is not a Creator he cannot create
[48:29] there's nothing original from Satan but
[48:32] he's a perverter and a distorter of
[48:34] whatever God has done so this Cosmos
[48:36] that we are in today is by the design of
[48:39] Satan and by the kingdom of darkness and
[48:42] that's why it's in the condition it's in
[48:43] today amen it's been transformed from
[48:47] the original design into Satan's now you
[48:49] talk about the original creation and I
[48:50] love brother Brandon how he just he
[48:52] breaks into these things and he
[48:53] dramatizes it and he he goes to some
[48:55] length he's talking about the original
[48:56] creation because you know he looks in
[48:58] there he talks about the six days being
[49:00] a six thousand years each days is a
[49:02] thousand years and I love because the
[49:04] problem would talk about how you know
[49:06] God took these six thousand years to
[49:08] carefully craft this place for his
[49:11] children to dwell he took these great
[49:13] volcanoes and magma maybe that the war
[49:15] was like before and he began to bring up
[49:17] mountains and land masses and God
[49:19] planted Seas seasoning and he caused
[49:22] life to team forth from those places and
[49:24] the lion in the lamb they laid down
[49:26] together and the Stars he hung
[49:28] everything in a perfect place and
[49:30] brother Brown uses uh he uses this term
[49:32] it was perfect it was perfect peace
[49:34] Perfect Harmony
[49:36] and so God creates everything with a
[49:37] certain kind of a Harmony where
[49:38] everything works together and I want to
[49:41] remind you today the reason I'm saying
[49:42] all this and I'm bringing this up is I
[49:44] want to remind you that God painted this
[49:46] great picture if I could say it this way
[49:48] God took this great work of art in this
[49:50] picture and his canvas and his easel was
[49:53] not a blank slate it wasn't blank but he
[49:55] took a chaos and a disorder because the
[49:57] Bible says that the Earth was without
[50:00] form and it was void
[50:02] so in the midst of disorder and Chaos
[50:05] God looks into it and he sees Aiden and
[50:07] he sees a masterpiece and he begins to
[50:10] work on his own creation and he begins
[50:12] to work on this the the different things
[50:14] and he forms this Eden out of a time of
[50:17] chaos amen and we see this time and time
[50:20] again in the Bible because it would be
[50:21] one thing amen it's one thing for God to
[50:24] take a blank canvas or a blank Slade and
[50:27] make something and do that that would be
[50:28] great but God in this chaos he comes in
[50:31] here maybe it was volcanic or whatever
[50:32] like the prophet said and he begins to
[50:34] do this and brother Brown says God's a
[50:36] great contractor
[50:38] because he lays all the stuff out at the
[50:40] beginning he doesn't have to go buy
[50:41] parts he's not like me when I work on a
[50:43] Home Project
[50:45] I lose a tool so I gotta go to the store
[50:46] to buy a tool that I lost I've got five
[50:48] at home
[50:49] when I go enough I realize I got the
[50:51] wrong board and you know you should
[50:52] measure twice and cut once because if
[50:54] not you're going back to buy another two
[50:55] by four by the time you're done you've
[50:57] spent more on gas and your house alone
[50:59] was worse
[51:01] but God's not that kind of a contractor
[51:02] he does exactly what he needs and he
[51:04] places all the material there and
[51:06] everything he needed for Eden everything
[51:09] he needed in the creation all those
[51:11] seeds and that light it was all laying
[51:13] there at the beginning and he simply is
[51:15] taking the material that is already
[51:18] there and he's bringing it into order
[51:20] he's bringing into form amen and I want
[51:23] you to remember that because it's just
[51:24] like the it's like here in the book of
[51:26] Nehemiah it'd be one thing for a man to
[51:28] come in and he starts a successful
[51:30] business he starts a successful church
[51:32] he makes a successful work of art but
[51:34] it's an entirely another thing when a
[51:36] man or a woman they can come into a
[51:37] situation which is in disorder which is
[51:40] in chaos which is falling apart and he
[51:43] can come and bring order that chaos and
[51:46] bring a restoration
[51:48] it's one thing if he just builds it
[51:49] right the first time but they're coming
[51:51] when somebody else has messed it up yeah
[51:53] when there's been this horror and to
[51:54] come and make that greater than it was
[51:57] before only God can do that
[52:00] amen praise the Lord you think about
[52:02] Nehemiah he comes to Jerusalem he
[52:04] doesn't have a draft rolled up and
[52:06] they're taped off where they're gonna
[52:07] build and everything's laid out for him
[52:09] there's a bunch of boards there he comes
[52:11] to a disaster he comes to wreckage and a
[52:14] rubble and chaos and he doesn't tell
[52:16] anybody what he's doing and he sets out
[52:18] in the middle of the night he begins to
[52:19] survey this is what's going on here I
[52:21] can't even get to this spot this is
[52:23] really bad
[52:24] yeah he gets there and he's coming into
[52:27] this situation he can't even take his
[52:29] Mount certain places but that's what
[52:31] makes him such a great example to us
[52:33] because he is handed a bunch of disorder
[52:36] he's handed chaos and he looks at these
[52:39] men he speaks to the Nobles he speaks to
[52:41] the rulers he says you see how great a
[52:43] distress we're in
[52:45] right this is a bad situation it don't
[52:48] look good you see how great the distress
[52:50] is Jerusalem lies in a ways the gates
[52:53] are burned with fire and you know what
[52:55] praise God
[52:56] he could have thrown in the towel
[52:59] I didn't know what I was getting into
[53:00] when I prayed about this
[53:02] when I was here in Babylon and I heard
[53:04] about this I didn't know how bad it was
[53:05] I heard it was bad but it's worse than I
[53:07] heard you know what I'm gonna throw in
[53:09] the towel it's a lost cause I shouldn't
[53:11] have asked the king you know God doesn't
[53:13] allow me to have favor with the King God
[53:15] has given me provision and he brought me
[53:17] here with the works too great I'm just
[53:19] gonna forget the whole thing
[53:21] but he didn't do this did you see how
[53:22] great it is you see how everything Lies
[53:25] when it's come let us build up the walls
[53:28] of Jerusalem let's do something about it
[53:32] if God is with us who can be against us
[53:35] if God has given us the material
[53:38] God has provided us a plan it doesn't
[53:41] matter how Bleak the situation looks it
[53:43] doesn't matter how much chaos we see in
[53:45] front of us God is not looking at that
[53:47] the way the men looked at it Nehemiah
[53:49] look at that rubble and see a lost cause
[53:50] he had a vision this will be restored
[53:55] you're looking at a bunch of walls
[53:56] broken down but this man's seeing a
[53:58] restoration let's build and he begins to
[54:02] speak to them and they they come
[54:03] together oh my God
[54:05] because he's seeing something that
[54:07] nobody else can see and I love it
[54:08] because he begins to testify hey man you
[54:11] get a testimony this morning this man
[54:13] begins to testify listen God is the one
[54:15] that brought me here today I'm walking
[54:17] around the city tonight because God
[54:19] dealt with this King God can be favored
[54:22] with his King God laid it on his heart
[54:25] to bring me here God brought me here
[54:27] today I'm not here by my own power God
[54:30] brought me to Jerusalem and the same God
[54:32] that brought me here he brought me here
[54:34] for a purpose that purpose is not to run
[54:37] away the purpose was not to give up the
[54:40] purpose was to build this wall again
[54:43] hey
[54:45] and he begins to testify to the Nobles
[54:48] and the rulers about the hand of God on
[54:50] his life and the favor of the king and
[54:52] they become stirred up they get inspired
[54:54] with his vision and they join together
[54:57] and the scripture says they said let us
[54:59] rise up and build
[55:03] oh my
[55:05] because it was a dire situation didn't
[55:07] mean it had to stay that way I don't
[55:09] know what each your situations are today
[55:11] and your situation might be a lot worse
[55:13] than my situation but I want to remind
[55:15] you let us rise up
[55:17] let us build because God has brought you
[55:19] here for a purpose no matter how bad it
[55:22] looks maybe because of how bad it looks
[55:24] God has brought you here God has brought
[55:26] you to this place in your life because
[55:28] he wants to bring about a design he's an
[55:31] architect of a greater world and what it
[55:33] is now is not what it's going to be and
[55:36] what it is in your life it's not what
[55:38] it's going to be one day
[55:40] you don't have to walk out of here with
[55:42] a bunch of broken down walls you don't
[55:44] have to walk out of here with a home
[55:45] that's in a bunch of chaos God can bring
[55:48] order
[55:49] God brings restoration I want to remind
[55:51] you today if you remember nothing else
[55:53] God excels at bringing order out of
[55:56] Chaos
[55:58] sells it going into creation that's
[56:00] fallen and destroyed and he brings
[56:02] orders of the diarist of situations
[56:07] this people Jerusalem they were a byword
[56:09] and a hissing all the nations and his
[56:12] God is telling you uh Jeremiah Nehemiah
[56:15] it's my son
[56:17] Nehemiah he's telling him I'm going to
[56:20] take away your approach I'm going to
[56:22] make this a testimony that even your
[56:25] enemies will recognize the hand of God
[56:28] in your life
[56:29] [Applause]
[56:31] wonderful
[56:33] God excels
[56:35] at bringing chaos out of order God
[56:38] Specializes in things thought impossible
[56:43] he doesn't just do it it's his specialty
[56:46] he's really good at it he's he's kind of
[56:48] showing it off look what I can do you
[56:51] might not be able to fix this but God
[56:53] can fix anything
[56:55] that's the problem we try to do a bunch
[56:57] of renovation let God come in your life
[56:59] once all the material is laying there he
[57:01] knows what he's doing if he can take the
[57:03] primordial chaos of the old world
[57:07] he can take that and bring forth and
[57:09] Eden and listen like I said he didn't
[57:11] just fix it up he made it perfect
[57:15] it wasn't just now I taped it together
[57:17] to be good for a few years till he saw
[57:19] the thing
[57:21] like I do
[57:23] hey man no it was perfect
[57:27] this is God we're talking about we're
[57:28] talking about God and brother man talks
[57:30] about it in the scripture talks about
[57:31] his seven Redemptive names God is a
[57:34] redeemer wanting to show off his
[57:36] Redemptive nature because it was in him
[57:39] to be a redeemer he cannot be a redeemer
[57:43] unless there's something to redeem so
[57:45] God is show off his power as a redeemer
[57:48] he allows man he allows circumstances he
[57:51] allows things to come into a condition
[57:54] of disorder and chaos to show he's still
[57:57] a redeemer
[58:00] he's a Creator and he's a redeemer and
[58:03] in the worst situations the most dire of
[58:06] circumstances he can weave and shape in
[58:09] to a masterpiece
[58:11] praise God
[58:13] program says this and Satan's Eden he
[58:15] says God's Eden was established in
[58:18] righteousness
[58:19] Satan's Eden is established in sin
[58:22] because Satan is sin God is righteous
[58:24] and God's kingdom was established in our
[58:27] righteousness and peace and life and
[58:30] Satan's establishment is in sin and
[58:33] religious sin
[58:35] now it makes sense that his chaos that
[58:37] that Satan's Eden is established in sin
[58:40] because it was founded and predicated on
[58:42] a lie the whole thing's built on a
[58:43] single lie as one lie on top of the
[58:46] other and has become a Web of Lies and
[58:47] the whole thing's just lies all the time
[58:49] it's all the deception because he's
[58:51] distorted the Commandment of God that's
[58:53] what he did in the beginning
[58:54] he didn't deny the Commandment he just
[58:56] distorted well you know you have God did
[58:58] he really say it because listen you're
[58:59] not going to die I mean I mean you might
[59:01] get in trouble but it's not as bad as it
[59:03] looks
[59:04] he only had to change one word and based
[59:07] on the change of one word he has built
[59:08] his own Eden after six thousand years
[59:13] the penalty thereof he's a pervertor of
[59:15] the truth he distorts the penalty he
[59:16] distorts the idea behind it because
[59:18] again he cannot create his own order
[59:21] he cannot design his own thing he must
[59:23] pervert the design of God and I I think
[59:26] to myself how incredibly frustrating it
[59:29] must be for a being which is obsessed
[59:31] with his own Beauty and his own Pride to
[59:34] know that no matter how hard he tries no
[59:36] matter what he does he can never be a
[59:38] creator
[59:39] he can lie he can Bluff the whole world
[59:42] he can trick everybody but yeah it must
[59:44] be so frustrating for all he's done and
[59:46] for all of his achievement in the
[59:48] world's condition today for all that God
[59:51] has placed what that being wanted what
[59:53] Satan won he's placed it in his children
[59:56] creative power it's in your tongue death
[59:59] and life are in the power of your tongue
[1:00:02] in our tongues we use him a lot for
[1:00:04] death and the world uses them a lot for
[1:00:06] death but there's life in your tongue as
[1:00:08] well your tongue has the power to speak
[1:00:12] worlds into existence
[1:00:14] your your tongue if it's yielded to God
[1:00:17] has the power to impart a life he can't
[1:00:20] do that if he wants to
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:22] he's done all kinds of things he can
[1:00:25] impersonate almost every gift and
[1:00:27] everything else he's like I said he's
[1:00:28] got the whole world the whole world the
[1:00:30] Bible says whose names are not in the
[1:00:32] Lamb's Book of Life they're deceived
[1:00:34] they're Spellbound by what Satan has
[1:00:36] done in this day and yet for all that he
[1:00:38] has achieved he can't speak of squirrel
[1:00:40] in existence
[1:00:41] they can't give a little vicious life
[1:00:43] back
[1:00:44] he can't restore the eyes of the bond he
[1:00:48] can't redeem he can't say he's nothing
[1:00:50] but a bluff
[1:00:51] he wants people to think it's great but
[1:00:53] it's not great compared to this first
[1:00:55] Eden it doesn't even compare and it does
[1:00:59] not compare to that which is to be that
[1:01:02] which is to come
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:08] I want you to remember this
[1:01:10] the fruit of chaos is confusion
[1:01:14] I mean that's the fruit of cats when you
[1:01:15] have confusion and you have all these
[1:01:17] things and that's what he's done he's
[1:01:18] he's cast confusion in the world he's
[1:01:20] cast chaos in the world he's the author
[1:01:22] of confusion that's why it's in a
[1:01:24] chaotic condition today he's the one
[1:01:27] that did that
[1:01:28] hey man he did that you put the little
[1:01:30] sticker on the gas pumps like that yeah
[1:01:32] I did that Satan did that you wonder why
[1:01:35] it looks bad day Satan did that he built
[1:01:37] it well praise the Lord but the fruit of
[1:01:40] order
[1:01:42] is harmony
[1:01:43] amen God is not the author of confusion
[1:01:46] the original creation had Harmony the
[1:01:48] harmony was within itself and with God
[1:01:51] and that Harmony is now gone because
[1:01:53] chaos has been introduced by the LIE of
[1:01:55] Satan
[1:01:57] and that's why the world's falling apart
[1:01:58] and all creation the Bible says all
[1:02:00] creation is now groaning because
[1:02:02] creation itself is a witness this isn't
[1:02:05] how it's supposed to be
[1:02:08] and in the cycles of life and the things
[1:02:10] we see in nature it testifies the lion
[1:02:12] doesn't lay down with the lamb anymore
[1:02:13] things are not as it was once it used to
[1:02:16] be but they will be that way again
[1:02:19] amen but the disorder of this world
[1:02:22] today that's why I'm saying this this is
[1:02:23] the it's a it's a testament or an
[1:02:25] earmark of Satan's brand of
[1:02:27] craftsmanship
[1:02:28] you know I love that you get these
[1:02:30] professional you know uh the art dealers
[1:02:32] or art critics or whatever and they can
[1:02:34] spot a fake you know we look at it and
[1:02:36] scratch my head what looks like the Mona
[1:02:37] Lisa and I don't realize she's got a
[1:02:38] beard or something you know what I mean
[1:02:41] there's a little thing on a place here a
[1:02:43] different color yeah I have no idea but
[1:02:45] somebody that really knows what they're
[1:02:46] looking at that can identify the artist
[1:02:48] if it's a genuine or fake because
[1:02:50] there's certain things about the way the
[1:02:51] artist did it there's certain things
[1:02:53] about the material that they use or
[1:02:54] whatever they can spot a fake from the
[1:02:57] real and listen and let me say this as a
[1:02:59] Critic of Satan's work I can identify
[1:03:01] his work according to the scripture when
[1:03:03] you see chaos and you see this order you
[1:03:05] see sickness and death that's the work
[1:03:07] of Satan we know who designed that
[1:03:11] we know who put that there we're not
[1:03:13] confused about it we can identify it
[1:03:15] amen because Satan's entire Eden is
[1:03:18] marked with death and chaos and that's
[1:03:21] how he notes his work the Bible says
[1:03:22] that the wisdom that is from beneath
[1:03:24] it's Earthly it's sensual it's devilish
[1:03:28] where everything in Strife is there's
[1:03:30] confusion
[1:03:32] and every evil work
[1:03:34] so you know who the designer of it is
[1:03:36] because of how it turned out it's always
[1:03:39] death it's always confusion it's always
[1:03:42] evil
[1:03:44] so like an architect or an artist he
[1:03:46] leaves something behind and what he does
[1:03:49] that he can always identify who did it
[1:03:52] you can authenticate his work by this
[1:03:54] identifier but I want to remind you
[1:03:56] again no matter how bad it looks God
[1:03:58] excels at bringing chaos out of order
[1:04:00] amen because he's not the author of
[1:04:02] confusion but of Peace it's his
[1:04:04] identification his identification is
[1:04:07] peace his identification is harmony his
[1:04:11] identification is the reconciliation of
[1:04:13] things by creation into Redemption amen
[1:04:17] and this is Believers we already know
[1:04:19] that the heavens and the Earth they will
[1:04:21] be renovated
[1:04:23] the Bible said that old things are going
[1:04:24] to pass away and all things are going to
[1:04:26] be made new and God being a good
[1:04:28] contractor all the materials already
[1:04:29] laying here right now
[1:04:32] and then when God renovates this Earth
[1:04:34] and he brings about a new heavens and a
[1:04:36] new Earth he's not getting a new lump of
[1:04:38] clay he's not going to new generation of
[1:04:40] people he's going to take what's lame
[1:04:42] here today in Sheffield Ohio he's going
[1:04:45] to take what's laying on the Earth today
[1:04:46] and he's going to fasten it out of the
[1:04:48] material that's already laying here
[1:04:51] everything he needs to do it is in this
[1:04:55] building today it's in you today to do
[1:04:58] it amen you don't have to go buy more or
[1:05:00] fabricate more or furnish more he's got
[1:05:03] it
[1:05:04] in you he's got it it's already there
[1:05:08] amen praise the Lord
[1:05:11] all the material the Bible says all
[1:05:13] things we've talked about it earlier all
[1:05:15] things are upheld by the word of his
[1:05:17] power
[1:05:18] hey man everything around us the things
[1:05:20] what you're seeing they're made of
[1:05:21] things which are unseen this is because
[1:05:23] you don't see it doesn't mean it's not
[1:05:25] there the very power that reserves the
[1:05:27] world that formed the world is going to
[1:05:29] redeem the world it's going to change
[1:05:31] the world Amen and we believe that we
[1:05:33] believe it was his spirit in the
[1:05:34] beginning
[1:05:35] in the in the disorder of the original
[1:05:38] creation when the Earth was without form
[1:05:40] and void it was his Spirit his Spirit
[1:05:43] began to brood over the Earth it began
[1:05:45] to brood and bring life where there was
[1:05:47] death but there was life laying there in
[1:05:48] a seed form it was laying in the
[1:05:50] original creation there amen
[1:05:52] Hallelujah
[1:05:54] you know it's interesting because
[1:05:55] brother Ram talks about the Earth
[1:05:56] because the Earth has an attribute of
[1:05:58] God and we're attributes of God and
[1:06:00] we're part of the Earth We're each part
[1:06:02] of the earth and the way he redeems
[1:06:04] Mance the way he redeems the world the
[1:06:05] world's had his baptism
[1:06:07] and then the flood brother Ram says it
[1:06:09] has baptism it had it was washed off the
[1:06:11] blood of Jesus Christ when he was
[1:06:12] crucified it fell from the cross and it
[1:06:15] paid the price it fell to the Earth as
[1:06:17] the price of sanctification to redeem
[1:06:20] the Earth but he's fixing to burn the
[1:06:22] Earth all the elements will be melted
[1:06:24] with a ferving heat it's going to
[1:06:26] receive its baptism of fire because it's
[1:06:28] got to be cleansed in order for a new
[1:06:30] creation amen
[1:06:33] and that's when everything comes into
[1:06:34] Divine Harmony once again the lion lays
[1:06:37] down with the lamb and all things are
[1:06:39] are new they're at that point and the
[1:06:40] Bible says that the scripture talks
[1:06:42] about it in that place there'll be no
[1:06:44] more death Hallelujah
[1:06:47] that's all we've known since we were
[1:06:49] born as death we see it all around us
[1:06:51] from the time we're a little kid we see
[1:06:53] death and sorrow and pain
[1:06:56] my little boy Moses he got hurt last
[1:06:58] night he whacked his head in another kid
[1:06:59] and got this big old goose egg and this
[1:07:02] and that and I was like man I you know
[1:07:04] as a parent you don't want to have to
[1:07:05] hurt ever but you know that's kind of
[1:07:07] how they learn that's that's how we
[1:07:09] learn this Earth we go through things
[1:07:10] but in this place you won't have to
[1:07:12] learn nothing the hard way
[1:07:14] be no more death there'll be no sorrow
[1:07:17] the former things are passed away and he
[1:07:19] that son on the throne said behold I
[1:07:22] make all things new
[1:07:25] Hallelujah
[1:07:26] oh it's it's so Sublime it's it's
[1:07:28] Transcendent how can a man know that now
[1:07:31] we've read the scripture about how can
[1:07:33] you know because he's done the same
[1:07:34] thing in you
[1:07:36] he's done the same thing in you amen
[1:07:39] I've received the earnest of it in my
[1:07:41] heart already
[1:07:42] you've received the earnest of it
[1:07:44] already he's taken lives
[1:07:47] that were like that okay that old
[1:07:49] creation you were in darkness you were
[1:07:51] abound in sin you didn't know nothing
[1:07:53] about God you were as far away from God
[1:07:55] as possible but the spirit of God began
[1:07:58] to brood over your life the spirit of
[1:08:01] God began to move in your life because
[1:08:02] there was a predestinated seat laying
[1:08:05] there you didn't know nothing about it
[1:08:06] but the contractor knew all about it he
[1:08:09] laid it out and he began to take lives
[1:08:11] that were in disorder lives that were in
[1:08:13] sin lives that were far away from God
[1:08:15] and he brought them into an image this
[1:08:17] is what a son this is what a daughter of
[1:08:20] God looks like
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:24] he brought you into harmony
[1:08:27] with his will amen and he looks and the
[1:08:30] Bible talks about second Corinthians If
[1:08:32] any man is in Christ he is a new
[1:08:35] creature he's a new creation old things
[1:08:37] are passed away behold I love how the
[1:08:40] wording's the same and everything behold
[1:08:42] all things are new and all things are of
[1:08:47] God talking about you now
[1:08:51] praise the Lord amen people love to talk
[1:08:53] about themselves you might as well say
[1:08:54] something nice about yourself all things
[1:08:57] in you are new and they're all of God
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:01] behold he's wanting you to take notice
[1:09:03] because he's showing you the level of
[1:09:06] craftsmanship he's brought in you the
[1:09:09] amount of work in you he didn't just Pat
[1:09:10] you up or throw a Band-Aid on you the
[1:09:12] work he did in you it's marvelous it's
[1:09:15] marvelous in his sight it's marvelous in
[1:09:17] our eyes
[1:09:19] amen now you might not always see it in
[1:09:22] your own life
[1:09:23] hey man you might not always seen that
[1:09:24] person that you're praying for but God
[1:09:27] is Not Looking Through The Eyes of human
[1:09:29] understanding but like Nehemiah he is
[1:09:31] looking at what it will be
[1:09:34] Nehemiah was not looking at what it was
[1:09:36] then if he looked at that he would have
[1:09:38] walked away but he was looking at what
[1:09:40] it would be and God is looking in your
[1:09:42] life and saying I know what it's going
[1:09:44] to be like I know the potentials that
[1:09:47] lay there even when you don't know
[1:09:49] what's there he knows that everything's
[1:09:50] going to work out
[1:09:53] that's why the Bible says he's giving
[1:09:54] you all things that pertain to life and
[1:09:56] godliness he's identified his works and
[1:09:59] Satan's works
[1:10:01] Jesus did that in Saint John the 10th
[1:10:02] chapter he says the thief comes to steal
[1:10:05] and to kill and destroy
[1:10:08] in other words that's not why I came
[1:10:09] though I came that you would have a life
[1:10:12] and it more abundantly
[1:10:14] so God has wanted you to be able to
[1:10:16] distinguish between the works of Satan
[1:10:18] and his Works which you are his works
[1:10:20] you are his workmanship created in
[1:10:23] Christ Jesus under good works
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:27] to bring you into harmony because God
[1:10:29] has a way and an order of things
[1:10:32] and this is what I want you to catch
[1:10:33] with this he has a way of doing things
[1:10:36] in an order and if you Adventure outside
[1:10:38] of that it's the same designer as
[1:10:40] Satan's Eden
[1:10:41] Adventure outside of his design it's the
[1:10:44] it's the same thing you think about what
[1:10:46] makes you and I different from the rest
[1:10:48] of the world
[1:10:49] amen all right
[1:10:50] you look at Lucifer versus Iron brother
[1:10:52] bam talks about this his desire was to
[1:10:54] have Glory like God he wanted to have a
[1:10:57] kingdom like Gods amen he saw the things
[1:10:59] of God he saw the sons of God and Satan
[1:11:02] desire to have power he desired to have
[1:11:04] a position he desired to have a kingdom
[1:11:07] but he did not aspire to be like God in
[1:11:11] his character
[1:11:14] amen he wanted to have his power and his
[1:11:16] position but he didn't want the
[1:11:17] character or the humility of God
[1:11:20] amen that's the difference between you
[1:11:23] and I and the powers of Darkness that's
[1:11:25] the difference between the children of
[1:11:27] God and the children of Disobedience we
[1:11:29] have been invited the prophet said to be
[1:11:31] shaped into his character
[1:11:34] we're going to be in his likeness in his
[1:11:36] character
[1:11:38] the same designer from the beginning
[1:11:40] amen
[1:11:42] now when God creates something he can
[1:11:44] never deviate from his own order
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:47] whatever God intended see this is the
[1:11:50] thing this is why I talk about God being
[1:11:51] a Creator when God designed a plant he
[1:11:53] designed it with a purpose it was going
[1:11:56] to make oxygen it was going to do this
[1:11:57] it was going to give fruit to the Earth
[1:11:58] everything God did God doesn't make
[1:12:00] things willy-nilly God doesn't do things
[1:12:03] just on a whim everything has a purpose
[1:12:05] and a design behind it it has a very
[1:12:07] specific purpose and anytime you pervert
[1:12:10] that purpose it's Satan's Eden
[1:12:13] hey man so that means if you had a
[1:12:15] purpose there was there's always an
[1:12:16] intent I I like this word intent or
[1:12:18] intention God always has an intent
[1:12:21] behind everything he does
[1:12:22] when God did these things in the
[1:12:24] original creation he had an intention in
[1:12:26] mind behind it so to deviate from the
[1:12:28] intention or the purpose is to deviate
[1:12:30] from the character of God
[1:12:33] because God doesn't mince words or
[1:12:35] engage in vanity
[1:12:37] we look here in the scripture you don't
[1:12:38] have to turn there but the Bible talks
[1:12:40] about this in Ezekiel 48 during the time
[1:12:43] of the restoration of the new Temple
[1:12:45] this is the I believe it's in the
[1:12:46] Millennium it's not during the new
[1:12:47] heavens and new earth because in Ezekiel
[1:12:49] 48 when it talks about the restoration
[1:12:51] of Jerusalem here they go and they
[1:12:53] restore the temple worship and we
[1:12:55] believe that's going to happen amen
[1:12:57] praise the Lord there's going to be
[1:12:58] restoration throughout the Millennium
[1:13:00] they'll keep the feasts and the sabbaths
[1:13:02] and different things but in the new
[1:13:03] heavens and new earth there is no Temple
[1:13:06] because the Lord God Almighty and the
[1:13:08] lamb is the Temple of that place
[1:13:10] that's where you and I are going
[1:13:12] but I I the reason I love the scripture
[1:13:15] he's talking about the restoration of
[1:13:17] the the Jerusalem during the Millennium
[1:13:18] and it says this in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:13:20] 48 the very last verse of Ezekiel they
[1:13:24] talk about the city and it says it's the
[1:13:26] name of the city from that day shall be
[1:13:29] the Lord is there
[1:13:31] the name of the Cities the Lord is there
[1:13:33] it's Jehovah shama it's one of the
[1:13:35] Redemptive names of Jehovah in the
[1:13:37] scripture in the Hebrew the city will be
[1:13:39] called Jehovah shama the Lord is there
[1:13:42] and I begin to think about this because
[1:13:44] Ezekiel is writing this during the time
[1:13:46] of captivity his people and he they're
[1:13:49] they're in This Strange Land they're in
[1:13:51] this foreign place and they remember
[1:13:52] what God had done back in the day they
[1:13:54] knew the stories about Moses and they
[1:13:56] knew about the Tabernacle they knew
[1:13:58] about David and they knew about Solomon
[1:14:00] but here they're in a captive condition
[1:14:03] their lives are chaos they're not where
[1:14:05] they need to be
[1:14:06] but he sees this and he knows that one
[1:14:09] day they're going to go back there and
[1:14:12] when they go back there and God performs
[1:14:13] these things people will look at the
[1:14:16] city they'll look at the city and say
[1:14:18] jehovah-shama the Lord is there
[1:14:22] oh look at what God has done and they'll
[1:14:23] be able to identify we know where God's
[1:14:25] at because of what he did we see his
[1:14:29] craftsmanship in the restoration of the
[1:14:31] city we see these things and we know the
[1:14:34] Lord is there glory and so it is in the
[1:14:37] new heavens we go there the Lord God
[1:14:39] Almighty is the temple
[1:14:41] amen the Lambs the light of that City
[1:14:43] because why the Lord is there we'll be
[1:14:46] able to say when we're there the Lord is
[1:14:48] here
[1:14:49] then on the outside to say the Lord said
[1:14:51] the world no he's here he's right here
[1:14:54] we know he's here because we see his
[1:14:57] workmanship he's the architect of a
[1:14:59] greater world and when you see what God
[1:15:01] has done when you see restoration you
[1:15:04] can say I know where he's at I'm not
[1:15:07] guessing I'm not wondering the Lord is
[1:15:09] there
[1:15:10] in your life today you can say you know
[1:15:12] what the Lord is here I know what he did
[1:15:14] in my life I know what I was I know
[1:15:17] where I was headed but something made a
[1:15:19] change
[1:15:20] something changed the course of your
[1:15:21] life
[1:15:22] something changed circumstances in your
[1:15:24] life that you couldn't change and you
[1:15:26] can look and say you know what the Lord
[1:15:28] is here
[1:15:29] God made the difference in my life
[1:15:31] that's why I'm where I'm at today amen
[1:15:34] hallelujah
[1:15:36] amen Jehovah shama that's his
[1:15:38] architecture amen he's he's the Divine
[1:15:41] architect brother Brown said
[1:15:43] Jesus the wise master builder himself he
[1:15:45] he told his disciples what do you tell
[1:15:47] the disciples I'm gonna go and prepare a
[1:15:50] place for you
[1:15:52] hey man now you think about this because
[1:15:55] brother Brown says he's been working out
[1:15:57] for 2000 years he's just been preparing
[1:16:00] a place for us amen and on top of that
[1:16:02] he's already got a place prepared for
[1:16:05] you the Bible says if this Earthly
[1:16:07] Tabernacle be dissolved you've got one
[1:16:09] waiting
[1:16:11] why because he's already prepared he's
[1:16:12] got the material in there he don't have
[1:16:14] to furnish a theophany for you he don't
[1:16:16] have to work it up or whatever it's
[1:16:18] laying there it's already prepared and
[1:16:20] you've heard from it that's why you're
[1:16:22] here today that's why you're saying amen
[1:16:25] that's why you believe the word because
[1:16:26] you've heard from your theophany he's
[1:16:29] already prepared it and he's gone to
[1:16:31] prepare a place a New Jerusalem
[1:16:35] and let me just say this it's like
[1:16:37] brother Brown said we're not going to go
[1:16:38] Float On A Cloud
[1:16:39] and have a harp we're just floating
[1:16:41] around with some wispy no we're gonna
[1:16:42] have a body and we're going to come back
[1:16:44] and have a body and that body will eat
[1:16:46] and drink and we'll have houses amen God
[1:16:49] has prepared it and he's preparing it
[1:16:51] now amen
[1:16:53] because you get some people and I'll
[1:16:54] just throw this in this I guess this is
[1:16:56] free or whatever
[1:16:58] it's like when you go it's like when you
[1:17:00] go to the hotel and they say well you
[1:17:02] got complimentary breakfast well you did
[1:17:03] pay for it but I mean it's like nice
[1:17:05] that they give it to you're like yeah I
[1:17:06] got a bagel glory to God
[1:17:09] you're like wow they come with the room
[1:17:13] not in the room hopefully that'd be
[1:17:14] really good depends on how well they
[1:17:16] clean it
[1:17:18] hey man let me just say this God made a
[1:17:20] physical Earth in the beginning with
[1:17:21] physical people Jesus was physically
[1:17:23] resurrected because you have people in
[1:17:25] the message even they they try to
[1:17:27] spiritualize other something and that's
[1:17:28] not what the prophet preached that's
[1:17:30] what he thought it was until God
[1:17:31] straighten them out when he was a kid or
[1:17:33] whatever he thought well I'm gonna go be
[1:17:34] a cloud no you're gonna have a body
[1:17:36] and then you're gonna come back and have
[1:17:38] a glorified body and you're going to
[1:17:39] dwell on that body it's a physical body
[1:17:41] Christ was physically resurrected if God
[1:17:43] made a physical Earth with physical
[1:17:45] people in the beginning he never
[1:17:46] deviates from his design so Redemption
[1:17:49] has to look like look you can't restore
[1:17:51] it back if it wasn't like that in the
[1:17:52] first place it's for it to be restored
[1:17:54] it's got to be a physical body a
[1:17:56] physical Earth
[1:17:58] Amen brother man says Christianity is
[1:18:00] not based on replacement it's based on
[1:18:03] Resurrection
[1:18:05] amen he cannot deviate from the original
[1:18:07] pattern let me read this to you here
[1:18:09] it's in the future home 1964.
[1:18:12] but the RAM says this is the Divine
[1:18:14] architect
[1:18:15] amen has designed this for his beloved
[1:18:18] oh what a place it must be when divine
[1:18:22] nature a Divine architect has designed
[1:18:25] it for a Divine attribute that's been
[1:18:27] divinely predestined by Divine God who
[1:18:30] is the author of Divine Life
[1:18:33] what will that City look like think of
[1:18:36] it remember it's not in heaven John said
[1:18:38] I saw it coming down out of Heaven it's
[1:18:42] to be on the earth see now this Earth is
[1:18:45] going to pass away it's a redeemed Earth
[1:18:47] God didn't say he's going to raise up a
[1:18:48] new generation he's going to redeem the
[1:18:50] one that's already here
[1:18:53] ain't gonna raise up a new generation he
[1:18:55] redeems the one that's already here he's
[1:18:57] going to make no new world it's this one
[1:19:00] right here he's just going to burn it
[1:19:02] off cleanse it like he did you
[1:19:07] and then he says this I love this his
[1:19:09] plans must forever remain
[1:19:14] you remember that whatever God has said
[1:19:16] or done or willed once he spoke it once
[1:19:19] he's done it once he's desired it it's
[1:19:20] gonna happen
[1:19:21] it doesn't matter what calm you can get
[1:19:24] every devil out of hell and try to Reign
[1:19:26] against the will of God God will fulfill
[1:19:29] his plan because his plans must forever
[1:19:32] remain
[1:19:34] got to ordain that man would have
[1:19:36] dominion over the Earth in the beginning
[1:19:37] and guess what the fault can't stop that
[1:19:40] sin can't stop that your Hang-Ups can't
[1:19:42] stop that your first birth can't stop
[1:19:44] that his plans will forever remain
[1:19:48] he's going to have a people to Reign and
[1:19:50] rule on the earth I believe I'm looking
[1:19:52] at some of them right now amen it
[1:19:54] doesn't matter what you're going through
[1:19:55] in your job or your family his plans
[1:19:58] will forever remain
[1:20:01] he is going to bring it to pass because
[1:20:03] he's the designer of it and he's the
[1:20:05] Builder of it
[1:20:09] my mind he says remember it's going to
[1:20:11] not be to uh it's going not to be Heaven
[1:20:14] it comes down from heaven it's a
[1:20:16] Dwelling Place a place to dwell in to
[1:20:18] take up his Abode is it like John on the
[1:20:20] Isle of Patmos here in Revelation 21 he
[1:20:23] saw it descending John saw the city
[1:20:25] descending from heaven like a dove I was
[1:20:29] reading I was saying that's the same
[1:20:30] thing John the Baptist saw when Christ
[1:20:32] which is God's attribute in the earth
[1:20:34] that that piece of the earth that was
[1:20:36] his body his attribute when he come to
[1:20:38] John John saw the spirit of God
[1:20:40] descending like a dove on Christ
[1:20:44] Brother Bear makes the point that's when
[1:20:46] heavens and earth kiss
[1:20:47] there was a Reconciliation see Harmony
[1:20:49] come back in
[1:20:50] Harmony was restored the chaos there's
[1:20:53] no chaos now there's Harmony and what he
[1:20:55] did in Christ what he's going to do the
[1:20:57] new creation he's done and you and I
[1:21:02] so I sell this to make this point we're
[1:21:04] talking about Jehovah shalom
[1:21:06] amen how how is the Lord the Lord is
[1:21:08] there how do you know because of the the
[1:21:10] harmony has been restored I mean so in
[1:21:13] order to understand that you have to
[1:21:14] know what the plan of God was amen God
[1:21:17] showed Moses a design one time
[1:21:19] when he went up in the mountain he
[1:21:21] sought the Lord
[1:21:22] and God began to speak to him after 40
[1:21:24] days God showed Moses the design of that
[1:21:27] first Tabernacle Moses was not up in the
[1:21:30] mountain with a piece of paper trying to
[1:21:32] figure out how he's going to put it
[1:21:33] together well listen God wants it this
[1:21:35] way well let me guess okay he says he
[1:21:37] wants three Tabernacle or three rooms
[1:21:39] should I do it this way should I do that
[1:21:40] no God showed him the design by
[1:21:43] inspiration and when he showed him the
[1:21:45] design he knew exactly how God wanted it
[1:21:48] put together this this pomegranate here
[1:21:50] this is gold this is Badger skin ever
[1:21:53] there was no detail
[1:21:55] there was no detail left up to Moses to
[1:21:59] figure out God showed him every part of
[1:22:01] the plan
[1:22:03] amen God is an architect he has a
[1:22:05] pattern and he always follows that same
[1:22:07] pattern brother bam says this this is in
[1:22:09] 1953 speak to the Rock brother man says
[1:22:11] how many of her read a line from your
[1:22:13] wife he says when I was in Africa my
[1:22:15] wife would write me a letter she would
[1:22:17] say dear husband I am sitting here
[1:22:19] tonight thinking of you he said I love
[1:22:21] her when I left home I didn't have to
[1:22:23] say no look no don't you have nobody
[1:22:25] else I'm your husband don't you get out
[1:22:27] here and don't you do that I don't have
[1:22:29] to do that
[1:22:30] she loves me and I love her and I say
[1:22:34] goodbye honey pray for me and I go on
[1:22:37] she just knows that's what she she just
[1:22:39] doesn't I do the same thing because I
[1:22:41] love her she loves me so it's just a
[1:22:43] love of hair
[1:22:45] that's the same way it is with God I
[1:22:47] just take his word and he just that's
[1:22:49] all there is to it no matter what you
[1:22:51] see
[1:22:52] he said but when she writes me a letter
[1:22:54] she might kind of hold back a little bat
[1:22:56] hold a little back refrain she'll say
[1:22:58] certain certain things but now what I'm
[1:23:01] talking it's just in the letter I'm
[1:23:02] reading that letter but I read between
[1:23:04] the lines too I know what she's talking
[1:23:07] about I can read between the lines he
[1:23:10] said now there's a whole lot of that so
[1:23:12] in this great love story of the Bible
[1:23:14] read between the lines there's the
[1:23:16] structure work
[1:23:17] we're talking about architecture today
[1:23:19] we're talking about building the design
[1:23:20] here's the structure work he says
[1:23:23] there's a structure the Bible is
[1:23:24] structured but the holy spirit's
[1:23:25] building the building now certainly it's
[1:23:28] got to frame together and look like this
[1:23:31] and like that and like that but the holy
[1:23:34] spirit's putting it together
[1:23:37] once you remember you didn't start it
[1:23:38] and you're not going to finish it
[1:23:40] listen Paul he rebukes the Galatians
[1:23:42] probably worsely remakes any other
[1:23:44] churches he started he rebukes the
[1:23:46] Galatians and listen having begun in the
[1:23:48] spirit are you not going to be made
[1:23:50] perfect in the flesh
[1:23:52] a lot of times as Christians as best as
[1:23:54] we get older we we begin to we're going
[1:23:56] to lean our own testimony our own
[1:23:58] understanding we begin to lean on our
[1:24:00] our reputation or these different things
[1:24:01] but listen you need to depend on God
[1:24:04] just as much today as the very first
[1:24:06] time you needed him
[1:24:08] your dependence today is not less but
[1:24:10] greater than it ever was before because
[1:24:12] the building's a little further up than
[1:24:14] it was and you're depending on him to
[1:24:16] finish the work you're not going to
[1:24:18] finish it on your own ability
[1:24:19] your flesh your human ability will not
[1:24:22] finish the work of God but the same one
[1:24:25] that started it he'll finish it
[1:24:27] the holy spirit's putting it together
[1:24:30] guess what he says he says just like
[1:24:31] Solomon's Temple oh my I love this this
[1:24:34] is good just like Solomon's Temple was
[1:24:36] cut out all over the world one block was
[1:24:39] cut from this way and one cup that way
[1:24:41] and when they come together every block
[1:24:44] went right to its place without a buzz
[1:24:47] or a saw or a sound of a hammer the
[1:24:50] great Church of the Living God is Born
[1:24:52] Again Stones cut out
[1:24:55] that's remarkable to me you go read the
[1:24:57] story it's in uh First Kings the sixth
[1:25:00] chapter
[1:25:00] then when they begin to build this
[1:25:02] Temple the scripture talks about there's
[1:25:03] no sound of a saw or a hammer or any
[1:25:05] kills of iron in the entire Temple
[1:25:07] everything that they fabricated for this
[1:25:09] Temple they brought in they cut it
[1:25:11] wherever it was at it could be over here
[1:25:12] in one place in Syria or Lebanon or
[1:25:15] wherever they would cut this plant or
[1:25:17] cut this board or shake this brunt and
[1:25:19] when they brought together it had to fit
[1:25:22] they weren't going to take it back they
[1:25:23] weren't going to okay well listen we've
[1:25:25] got it where we need bus let's just
[1:25:26] finish it up a little bit more it
[1:25:28] doesn't quite fit right when it got
[1:25:29] there it was perfect
[1:25:31] foreign
[1:25:34] think about that you know it's that's
[1:25:36] astounding from an engineering point no
[1:25:38] I'm not an engineer but just just in my
[1:25:40] mind as an amateur student of
[1:25:43] engineering that's astounding yes it is
[1:25:45] hey man because first of all that means
[1:25:48] the blueprint was so perfect they didn't
[1:25:50] have to make adjustments well we didn't
[1:25:52] know it was going to fit this way or
[1:25:53] this and that we'll make an adjustment
[1:25:54] here the plan was perfect from the
[1:25:57] get-go
[1:25:58] and Not only was it perfect there was
[1:26:00] how many different laborers think about
[1:26:02] the number of Craftsmen involved in
[1:26:05] making this Temple that took seven years
[1:26:07] I believe it was to build seven years of
[1:26:09] a guy over here with a saw and a guy
[1:26:11] over here with a hammer and every one of
[1:26:13] them
[1:26:14] we're so inspired by Solomon's Vision by
[1:26:18] the pattern that God had laid out listen
[1:26:19] it doesn't matter how good of a
[1:26:21] Craftsman you are they can't perform
[1:26:22] that in themselves God inspired the
[1:26:25] workers so much under that plan that
[1:26:29] when every piece come together it was
[1:26:30] perfect that's astounding yeah
[1:26:33] you can do that today with the best
[1:26:34] tools the best engineering you can't do
[1:26:37] it there's got to be an adjustment
[1:26:38] there's got to be a part that's rejected
[1:26:39] there's something somewhere but this
[1:26:42] plan was so perfect and the people were
[1:26:44] so inspired behind it everything fit
[1:26:46] perfect the first time
[1:26:50] astounding
[1:26:51] hey man
[1:26:55] we should think about that and they
[1:26:57] weren't just coming from a factory one
[1:26:58] place from all around the world hey man
[1:27:02] you know sometimes we we wonder how's
[1:27:04] God going to do it how's God gonna have
[1:27:06] a bride without spotter blemish you know
[1:27:08] we hear a lot about the churches or
[1:27:09] dividers today and churches are divided
[1:27:11] and people are divided denominations and
[1:27:13] groups and we've been hearing the masses
[1:27:14] the message is so divided I want to
[1:27:16] remind you today that the church is not
[1:27:18] divided
[1:27:20] impulsive Christ is not divided amen you
[1:27:23] say what about all the division listen
[1:27:24] men are divided but Christ isn't divided
[1:27:28] Christ's plan remains that's why but the
[1:27:31] brain was against the denominational
[1:27:32] spirit it's outside of the design of God
[1:27:34] we were called to be one people one
[1:27:37] Faith one Lord one baptism and
[1:27:40] and divine and men like going to camp
[1:27:42] but the body of Christ is not divided
[1:27:45] Christ is one body it's one it's one
[1:27:48] body of Christ
[1:27:49] we might be many members but it's one
[1:27:51] body amen
[1:27:53] it might not look how we think it should
[1:27:55] look but let me assure you he knows
[1:27:57] exactly how to put it together if he can
[1:27:59] take stones and logs for Solomon's
[1:28:02] Temple and bring together perfectly he
[1:28:04] can bring a body of Christ out of a
[1:28:07] rekindred and tongue and nation and
[1:28:10] tribe in people
[1:28:11] and he's not bringing together a bunch
[1:28:13] of scraps they're holy they're blameless
[1:28:15] they're accepting the Beloved they're
[1:28:18] perfect and inside they are exactly the
[1:28:21] way he designed them
[1:28:24] yes that Temple is going to come
[1:28:26] together so well you don't even there's
[1:28:28] no there's no light shining the through
[1:28:30] there's no there's not some Stone that's
[1:28:31] a little lopsided well we gotta take it
[1:28:32] bro you know brother Bill's gotta go
[1:28:34] back and we gotta reshape him a little
[1:28:35] bit no it's exactly how he wants it now
[1:28:37] you might not think that I know I'm not
[1:28:40] in the shape I want to be
[1:28:42] we could sit here and dwell on this a
[1:28:43] long time
[1:28:45] hey man but he's not looking at what
[1:28:48] you're seeing he's not looking at the
[1:28:49] chaos
[1:28:50] side man it's shaped exactly how he
[1:28:53] wants it
[1:28:55] it fits together perfectly because he's
[1:28:58] not just the architect of Solomon's
[1:28:59] Temple he's not just the architect of
[1:29:01] the Tabernacle he's the architect of a
[1:29:03] greater world the whole world he's going
[1:29:06] to come together under the headship of
[1:29:08] Jesus Christ and the Bride of Jesus
[1:29:10] Christ and there's going to be Harmony
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:13] divine order is restored
[1:29:17] the Bible says this David was talking to
[1:29:19] Solomon about this Temple
[1:29:21] it's in first Chronicles 28. and he
[1:29:24] begins to tell his son Solomon listen
[1:29:26] I've I've already made Provisions for
[1:29:27] the material right I've got a plan here
[1:29:29] all you have to do is follow this you
[1:29:32] follow this and you use what I've given
[1:29:34] you and the temple will turn out perfect
[1:29:37] salmon you don't have to make an
[1:29:38] adjustment
[1:29:40] you don't have to go find something else
[1:29:41] I it's all laid out here I've made it as
[1:29:43] easy as can be all you have to do is
[1:29:46] follow this do what I said God will take
[1:29:50] care of the rest
[1:29:52] all this said David the Lord made me to
[1:29:54] understand in writing by his hand upon
[1:29:57] me even all the works of this pattern
[1:30:00] that David shows him this he lays out
[1:30:02] and I love this next verse and David
[1:30:04] said to Solomon and his son be strong
[1:30:06] and of good courage
[1:30:08] to come out of place let's put this
[1:30:10] board here do this here by the way
[1:30:12] be strong of good courage
[1:30:15] and do it
[1:30:17] fear not nor be dismayed for the Lord
[1:30:21] God even my God will be with thee he
[1:30:25] will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:30:28] until thou has finished all the work for
[1:30:31] the service of the house of the Lord not
[1:30:34] really beginning to think about that
[1:30:35] David laid all this out for his son he's
[1:30:38] made all these provisions and he must
[1:30:40] have realized someone was getting kind
[1:30:41] of concerned
[1:30:43] amen Psalm is probably looking the same
[1:30:45] how's it going to be this is a huge
[1:30:48] undertaking this undertaking gets
[1:30:50] greater than I can bear the undertaking
[1:30:52] is greater than what I could put
[1:30:54] together I don't have the ability I
[1:30:55] don't have this skill I'm concerned and
[1:30:57] David said listen don't be afraid listen
[1:31:00] I understand why you would be afraid but
[1:31:03] don't be there's a reason you don't have
[1:31:04] to be the Lord my God will be with thee
[1:31:08] amen the Lord is there
[1:31:11] because the Lord is there no matter how
[1:31:14] great the word looks no matter how hard
[1:31:16] it seems don't be afraid you'll never
[1:31:18] fail me he'll never forsake me
[1:31:22] my my God said I'm gonna finish this
[1:31:25] work this is gonna be my foot still this
[1:31:27] is the place I'm gonna put my name and
[1:31:30] if he would do that with that natural
[1:31:32] Temple which was to be destroyed how
[1:31:35] much more the Bride of Jesus Christ who
[1:31:37] will not be destroyed who will not enter
[1:31:40] into wrath but she shall endure forever
[1:31:43] yeah
[1:31:46] I'm saying this for a reason I want to
[1:31:47] remind you that the same architect he
[1:31:50] designed the worlds with meticulous care
[1:31:53] he designed this Temple he designed all
[1:31:56] these things he laid out the foundation
[1:31:57] of the world
[1:31:59] everyone's going to prepare a place for
[1:32:01] you
[1:32:02] he designed all these Tabernacles he's
[1:32:03] the one who called you
[1:32:05] hey man
[1:32:06] listen you're not fashioned after this
[1:32:08] world that's why you don't fit in you
[1:32:10] weren't shaped to fit in this Temple you
[1:32:12] were shaped to fit in a greater one
[1:32:16] Your Design is not flawed
[1:32:19] your first birth is flawed that's
[1:32:21] Satan's designed but your second birth
[1:32:23] it's not flawed it's shaped exactly how
[1:32:25] God wants it listen he's the one working
[1:32:27] on it
[1:32:30] and you try to make it fit into this
[1:32:31] world it's never going to fit because
[1:32:32] it's not designed for it
[1:32:34] see when God designed you he designed
[1:32:36] you with an intention
[1:32:39] wanted to fit in one to be popular one
[1:32:42] to have an easy time it was to be a part
[1:32:44] of his habitation
[1:32:46] to be a dwelling place for the most high
[1:32:49] God Amen and sometimes we get like
[1:32:51] Solomon we get All Shook Up well God I
[1:32:53] just know how you're gonna do in my life
[1:32:54] I don't know how you're gonna help my
[1:32:55] family I don't know how I don't know how
[1:32:57] to overcome this addiction I don't know
[1:32:59] how many overcome this complex listen
[1:33:01] don't be afraid
[1:33:03] fear not he's the one that's with you he
[1:33:06] knows exactly how to get it into the
[1:33:08] right condition
[1:33:10] from the building amen
[1:33:12] we get shook up we listen we get shook
[1:33:14] up sometimes people get shook up I don't
[1:33:16] know I'm gonna make in the Rapture I
[1:33:18] don't even know I'm gonna make it
[1:33:18] through the day God knows how he's gonna
[1:33:20] do it
[1:33:21] God's not shook up about it God's not
[1:33:24] ringing his hands God's not worried I
[1:33:25] don't know how I'm gonna get you in
[1:33:26] you've just done make too many mistakes
[1:33:28] God knows exactly what to do to get you
[1:33:30] in the condition and sometimes it might
[1:33:32] not be real comfortable sometimes you
[1:33:35] might not like it but guess what God
[1:33:36] knows what he's doing
[1:33:38] no one can design a piece of
[1:33:40] architecture like God no one can design
[1:33:43] like God and if he's made you a part of
[1:33:46] the plan you've got every reason never
[1:33:48] to be afraid
[1:33:50] oh but I've got circumstances I've made
[1:33:52] mistakes God knows what he's doing when
[1:33:54] you're done
[1:33:56] your life and your times have not been
[1:34:00] left up to circumstance
[1:34:02] it has not been left up to chance when
[1:34:04] God oh my when God looked at you
[1:34:08] through eternity down the quarters of
[1:34:09] time he looked at you with a purpose
[1:34:11] that's my daughter that's my son that's
[1:34:14] not canon fodder that's not the leftover
[1:34:17] that's not the the foolish version
[1:34:19] there's a son there's a daughter I've
[1:34:22] got a place on the earth they're going
[1:34:24] to rule I've got a purpose reserve for
[1:34:26] them he knows exactly what it's going to
[1:34:28] be and where it's at
[1:34:31] listen your substance when it was hit of
[1:34:33] the earth and all the molecules that
[1:34:34] make up your body today were scattered
[1:34:36] throughout the the food that your
[1:34:37] ancestors and everything God knew every
[1:34:39] molecule where it would go
[1:34:43] we make a mistake like I just don't want
[1:34:45] me to make it
[1:34:47] I just done messed up too bad oh I just
[1:34:50] I don't have you know
[1:34:52] I did this wrong I did that wrong right
[1:34:54] I don't see it this way or I'm not this
[1:34:56] way I wish I was like this one or that
[1:34:57] one God knows what he's doing when he
[1:35:00] designed you foreign
[1:35:01] don't look at God's architecture say
[1:35:03] well I wish God had done it different
[1:35:04] God he could have done this with my life
[1:35:06] God made you the way he wanted for a
[1:35:08] reason
[1:35:09] because I can't take the board's place
[1:35:11] and the board can't take my place
[1:35:13] hey man we get all worried about we get
[1:35:16] all concerned but there's no virtue and
[1:35:18] worry
[1:35:22] but brother my life's a complete mess
[1:35:24] I've got all kinds of issues I've got so
[1:35:27] much trouble and issues I there's
[1:35:29] nowhere to begin listen that's what DMI
[1:35:31] came in across hey man it was it wasn't
[1:35:34] just a board falling over the whole
[1:35:36] thing was a wreck but let me remind you
[1:35:39] once where God excels at bringing order
[1:35:42] out of Chaos
[1:35:43] God excels at bringing children into
[1:35:46] harmony with his will
[1:35:49] yeah God can take dry bones
[1:35:53] pull them together
[1:35:54] put skin on him and put sin on him and
[1:35:57] raise him up and breathe life into dead
[1:35:59] dry bones that are scattered everywhere
[1:36:01] and make an exceeding great Army
[1:36:05] God can take something out of nothing
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:10] your life is not so far removed from the
[1:36:13] will of God that he can't make a change
[1:36:16] but the trick is that the solutions let
[1:36:18] him do the work we try too much to do
[1:36:21] ourselves because we don't like how it
[1:36:23] looks but the problem is we're looking
[1:36:24] at the rubble we're not looking at the
[1:36:25] finished product because only God sees
[1:36:27] the finished product
[1:36:29] amen I don't see your finished product I
[1:36:31] don't even see my own you don't see mine
[1:36:33] you don't see your own but God does see
[1:36:35] it every time God looks at you and he's
[1:36:38] always looking at you every time God
[1:36:40] looks at you he doesn't see the mistake
[1:36:42] he doesn't see the human weakness he
[1:36:44] sees a finished product
[1:36:47] he says the process that I've put you in
[1:36:49] will make you turn out exactly how I
[1:36:51] want you to be
[1:36:53] you said so perfectly that when the time
[1:36:56] comes there won't be one thing that
[1:36:58] needs changed
[1:37:00] my
[1:37:04] God knows what he's doing
[1:37:06] how many times in our own lives maybe
[1:37:07] you maybe you feel this way I don't know
[1:37:09] but
[1:37:10] how many times your own lives can you
[1:37:11] look back
[1:37:12] you seem like you were never going to be
[1:37:14] able to get through another day
[1:37:16] I don't know how to overcome this
[1:37:18] problem
[1:37:19] I don't know how I'm ever going to
[1:37:20] survive this I don't know how I'm gonna
[1:37:21] be able to endure this
[1:37:23] Lord I have no idea how I'm gonna draw
[1:37:26] my next breath but you know what you're
[1:37:27] here
[1:37:30] amen because God Can Make A Way when
[1:37:32] there is no way
[1:37:34] listen there's no way for me to get
[1:37:36] through this at this alley this is so
[1:37:38] dilapidated God can make a way where
[1:37:40] there is no way
[1:37:42] what are you worried about we don't have
[1:37:44] to worry about what it looks like
[1:37:45] there's only one thing we need to know
[1:37:47] he's there if he's there if jehoma
[1:37:50] Shalom is there then he can fix it
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:56] people take this message and you know
[1:37:57] I've heard it for years well people took
[1:37:59] this message and they've made it into a
[1:38:01] mass and this and that you ever heard
[1:38:02] that before well listen that's not my
[1:38:04] testimony my testimonies God came in the
[1:38:06] mess of my life and he turned into a
[1:38:08] message
[1:38:10] I believe the message but I have a
[1:38:12] message
[1:38:13] your message when life was a mess God
[1:38:16] took your mess and he turned into a
[1:38:17] message he's still a redeemer
[1:38:20] he's still a Healer
[1:38:22] he's still a savior he's still a
[1:38:25] restorer broken homes
[1:38:27] he's still a person that can change the
[1:38:29] circumstances my life's not a mess amen
[1:38:32] it's a message your life's not a mess
[1:38:34] that might look like it to everybody
[1:38:36] else but God is writing a story in your
[1:38:39] life your life is a message to A Dying
[1:38:42] World to a defeated world that there's
[1:38:44] something's going to believe this word
[1:38:46] this someone's gonna take God at their
[1:38:48] word when nobody else wants to believe
[1:38:50] God somebody's gonna believe God
[1:38:52] somebody's gonna get a testimony
[1:38:54] somebody's gonna rise up and build when
[1:38:56] no one else wants to build they've heard
[1:38:58] the testimony of God they've heard the
[1:39:00] message of the hour and they've come
[1:39:02] together like the people under Nehemiah
[1:39:04] and they said let us rise up
[1:39:07] don't sit there and wallow and sell pity
[1:39:09] don't sit there and cry rallies up and
[1:39:12] build
[1:39:13] rise up against the powers of Darkness
[1:39:15] rise up against circumstances they're
[1:39:17] trying to put defeat in your life you've
[1:39:19] got the strength you've got the ability
[1:39:22] through Christ to rise up
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:28] Jehovah shalom
[1:39:29] Jehovah Jehovah's signature he knows
[1:39:33] what he's doing in your life he's a
[1:39:36] redeemer and listen he's here he's not
[1:39:38] just there he's here today is a witness
[1:39:42] the divine plan of God in your life
[1:39:46] listen God is not a sloppy businessman
[1:39:50] he knows what he's doing he's not like
[1:39:52] some people brother Ram said when he
[1:39:54] makes an investment he knows exactly why
[1:39:56] he made it the intent and the purpose is
[1:39:58] already laying there
[1:40:00] hey man
[1:40:05] you know in our own lives
[1:40:08] I say I sell this for a reason our own
[1:40:10] lives
[1:40:11] the question is not usually
[1:40:13] what we're going through we all know
[1:40:15] what we're going through
[1:40:17] you take job's friends and they show up
[1:40:19] and job's going through this
[1:40:21] well job you're doing this and job you
[1:40:23] did that and this and that listen job
[1:40:25] did not need to hold the that's going
[1:40:28] through trouble
[1:40:30] well I just didn't know
[1:40:33] I have no idea I thought everything was
[1:40:35] going great I mean everybody died
[1:40:36] everything blew up
[1:40:38] the question was not what he was going
[1:40:40] he knew exactly what he was going
[1:40:41] through
[1:40:42] you know better than anybody what you're
[1:40:44] going through you don't need me to tell
[1:40:46] you your question John's question my
[1:40:49] question why
[1:40:53] why are we going through it
[1:40:56] Joe looks I don't know what I did wrong
[1:40:58] he didn't do anything wrong
[1:41:01] the designer knew what he was doing
[1:41:04] right you can have a time test Memorial
[1:41:06] he said you know what I'm gonna take
[1:41:07] this piece this part my temple and I'm
[1:41:10] gonna prove it I'm gonna let Satan work
[1:41:11] on him and do everything but take his
[1:41:13] life to prove that he can stand the test
[1:41:15] of time
[1:41:17] he didn't do anything wrong he was being
[1:41:19] proven
[1:41:21] my mind
[1:41:24] why in other words what's the intention
[1:41:27] that's why we it's not so much what you
[1:41:29] and I do we can do all the right things
[1:41:31] for all the wrong reasons and it's
[1:41:33] extension God's sight suspension is
[1:41:35] nostrils
[1:41:37] it's not what we do it's why our motive
[1:41:40] our objective our purpose Our intention
[1:41:44] when God does something we look and say
[1:41:46] but why
[1:41:47] why did God design it this way why did
[1:41:50] God let me go through this why is God
[1:41:52] allowed the life that I've been in to be
[1:41:54] so chaotic at times why is he allowed
[1:41:56] pain and hurt and rejection and just
[1:41:59] Devastation we know why because all
[1:42:01] things
[1:42:04] all things work together
[1:42:06] for good
[1:42:09] for them that love God
[1:42:11] for them who are the called according to
[1:42:12] his purpose
[1:42:14] his intent his design
[1:42:18] his design is why amen we're looking at
[1:42:21] the problem we're not looking at the
[1:42:22] design behind it
[1:42:24] listen this problem's not a problem it's
[1:42:26] an opportunity
[1:42:28] God's going to use it to get glory for
[1:42:31] himself in your life
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:36] you know
[1:42:37] people are funny
[1:42:39] People Are People
[1:42:41] you know people they're just these
[1:42:43] there's just these clusters of drama and
[1:42:45] activity you look at the World At Large
[1:42:47] like I said at the beginning you know
[1:42:48] they blame the system they blame the
[1:42:51] government or half of the government or
[1:42:52] whichever part of the government they
[1:42:53] want they blame their employer they
[1:42:55] blame the pastor they blame the church
[1:42:57] they blame family they blame everybody
[1:42:59] for everything negative that ever
[1:43:00] happens in their life
[1:43:01] you and I would ask the question why
[1:43:04] because with Christians
[1:43:06] many times we tend to get frustrated
[1:43:08] with ourselves because we possess this
[1:43:11] strange capacity to repent
[1:43:14] the world doesn't have amen for us it's
[1:43:17] no longer a foregone conclusion that
[1:43:18] we're always right about everything
[1:43:20] the world's like I'm not wrong everybody
[1:43:22] else is wrong not me we actually can be
[1:43:24] like you know what
[1:43:26] Maybe I'm Wrong
[1:43:30] we laugh because not everybody can do
[1:43:32] that
[1:43:33] you go work a job for a week you'll find
[1:43:35] out real quick not everybody can be
[1:43:36] wrong not everybody can be sorry not
[1:43:39] everybody can own updated I mean you see
[1:43:40] in politics all the time it's literally
[1:43:42] always somebody else's I've never heard
[1:43:43] a politician what's my fault never heard
[1:43:45] it you know why because people are dumb
[1:43:47] enough to believe it's somebody else's
[1:43:49] fault
[1:43:52] amen I thought I thought you'd be
[1:43:55] rolling on that one
[1:43:57] it's true they don't take response but
[1:43:59] you and I we know we can be wrong we
[1:44:02] know we have to repent they can't do
[1:44:05] that but the issue is sometimes we begin
[1:44:07] to sit there and we look and say well I
[1:44:09] must have done something wrong
[1:44:10] I must have found God somewhere I'm not
[1:44:13] good enough I'm not I'm not whatever I
[1:44:15] need to be
[1:44:18] it's like the disciples
[1:44:19] the Last Supper they're all sitting
[1:44:21] there with Lord is it eyes at me is it
[1:44:23] my fault something to miss
[1:44:26] when something's wrong we blame
[1:44:28] ourselves listen it's not always your
[1:44:29] fault
[1:44:31] hey man it's not always your fault
[1:44:34] why am I going through this sometimes
[1:44:35] it's just for the glory of God
[1:44:37] it's not your fault always
[1:44:39] amen
[1:44:41] see we're looking at our own ability not
[1:44:43] the architect's ability well I must have
[1:44:46] did something wrong that's not in the
[1:44:47] equation
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:51] he's the one that's doing it
[1:44:53] and sometimes when things are not worry
[1:44:55] sometimes in your life's in chaos I want
[1:44:57] to encourage you
[1:44:59] not everything's your fault
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:04] sometimes you just have to have patience
[1:45:08] amen I want to encourage you today to
[1:45:11] have patience with God
[1:45:15] all right because he's the one that's
[1:45:16] bringing everything into divine order no
[1:45:18] matter what you're dealing with today
[1:45:20] whatever the problem the Lord is there
[1:45:23] in your problem
[1:45:25] the Lord is there in your situation the
[1:45:28] Lord is there in your sickness the Lord
[1:45:30] is there in your mind battle because he
[1:45:32] wants to change the situation he wants
[1:45:35] to bring about his purpose and his
[1:45:37] intention so be patient with God he's
[1:45:41] still Jehovah shama he'll never leave
[1:45:43] you or forsake you let patience have her
[1:45:46] perfect work the Bible says amen through
[1:45:48] faith and patience we inherit the
[1:45:50] promises the Bible says you have need of
[1:45:53] patience and after you've done the will
[1:45:54] of God
[1:45:56] you might receive the promise
[1:45:59] see we endure many things as Christians
[1:46:02] amen we endure many things but the Bible
[1:46:04] says to endure them patiently
[1:46:07] because many times we're very quick I'm
[1:46:09] bringing this to a close but I just want
[1:46:11] you to remember this many times we lose
[1:46:12] patience
[1:46:13] amen the Bible says he's the husband of
[1:46:15] the earth he's got long patience he's
[1:46:19] not sweating how it's going to turn out
[1:46:20] he's taking his time for a reason he's
[1:46:24] got long patience
[1:46:27] you know in the original creation he
[1:46:28] took six thousand years Bill Bram talks
[1:46:30] about and I really this is
[1:46:31] why I was
[1:46:33] this whole sermon how I'm talking about
[1:46:35] this why
[1:46:39] why in the creation he's God
[1:46:41] he can do it as fast listen God can do
[1:46:43] anything anytime he wants is it's not
[1:46:45] like he had to build up the ability to
[1:46:46] make things why did God take his time in
[1:46:49] creation
[1:46:51] because some things are worth taking
[1:46:52] their time for
[1:46:54] amen
[1:46:55] some things get better with time
[1:46:58] amen without time passing listen if time
[1:47:02] doesn't go past there's no such thing as
[1:47:04] transformation without time passing
[1:47:07] there's no such thing as growth without
[1:47:09] the passage of time so some things take
[1:47:11] time because they're worth taking time
[1:47:13] for
[1:47:14] and God allowed himself to have six
[1:47:18] thousand years pass in creation as a
[1:47:21] testament that it was worth taking time
[1:47:23] to do
[1:47:25] why because you're worth taking time
[1:47:28] amen God's not impatient with you God's
[1:47:32] not upset and trying to ring his hands
[1:47:34] and figure out how he's going to do plan
[1:47:35] B in your life God's very patient with
[1:47:37] you God is more patient with you than
[1:47:39] you are yourself
[1:47:41] and that's what I want to remind you
[1:47:43] today many times we're quick to lose
[1:47:44] patience with God or someone else many
[1:47:47] times we're not patient with ourselves
[1:47:50] that's why we live defeated and that's
[1:47:52] why we get upset and that's why we get
[1:47:54] frustrated we say I I it shouldn't be
[1:47:56] this way listen be patient with yourself
[1:47:58] God's patient with you you're worth
[1:48:00] being patient with
[1:48:02] all right if God says you're worth
[1:48:03] taking time
[1:48:04] God says you're worth taking time to
[1:48:06] shape and to fashion and to grow listen
[1:48:08] if he thinks that about you you ought to
[1:48:11] think that about you
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:15] like I said
[1:48:16] many times as a Christian especially
[1:48:18] we're the person that can't have
[1:48:20] patience with us the pastor and the
[1:48:22] Deacon and everyone we can have patience
[1:48:23] with everybody else but ourselves
[1:48:26] but if you're gonna be patient about the
[1:48:28] work of God be patient about God's work
[1:48:30] in your own life
[1:48:32] allow God to take his time listen him
[1:48:36] taking his time is an Evidence of his
[1:48:38] care for you
[1:48:41] because he likes you
[1:48:44] the way he designed you
[1:48:46] he doesn't necessarily like the way the
[1:48:47] world tried to shape you but he likes
[1:48:49] the way he designed you
[1:48:51] he likes the way you sing at church
[1:48:54] he likes the way you think about that
[1:48:56] person nobody else thinks about
[1:48:58] he likes the way you smile he likes the
[1:49:00] way you pray he loves it when you pray
[1:49:02] he likes these things about you he's
[1:49:04] paid
[1:49:07] we're all frustrated with ourselves why
[1:49:10] can't I be more like this why can't I be
[1:49:12] this way listen
[1:49:14] be patient
[1:49:15] your worth being patient with
[1:49:21] we've all got problems but don't get
[1:49:23] discouraged don't give up on yourself we
[1:49:25] are quicker to give up on ourselves than
[1:49:28] God is to give up on us God doesn't give
[1:49:30] up on us we do that
[1:49:33] right bring It full circle you look at
[1:49:34] the at the book of Nehemiah at the
[1:49:36] beginning Nehemiah knew listen this
[1:49:37] wasn't going to happen overnight it was
[1:49:39] going to take years
[1:49:41] but it was worth it
[1:49:43] so the the time element doesn't matter
[1:49:45] it's worth it
[1:49:47] hey man
[1:49:48] what my my
[1:49:50] wasn't worried about criticism listen
[1:49:52] the reason I read this at the beginning
[1:49:53] the the Bible tells us not just there
[1:49:55] but other places you look at Tobias and
[1:49:57] Samba man they they just raked Nehemiah
[1:50:00] over the coals they looked at the wall
[1:50:02] they were building and at one point they
[1:50:04] looked and said you know what if a fox
[1:50:05] would run up that wall the wall would
[1:50:08] fall over
[1:50:09] that wall that can't even hold him a fox
[1:50:11] a stiff window knocked that thing over
[1:50:15] but you know what it didn't look
[1:50:16] impressive to them but Nehemiah he
[1:50:19] called on the name of the Lord
[1:50:21] Lord you take away our approach Lord you
[1:50:24] be our help and the bottles of the
[1:50:26] people joined together they had a mind
[1:50:28] to work and they built that wall and you
[1:50:31] know what happened they get to where
[1:50:32] they're finished up the wall the critics
[1:50:34] they suddenly get a little worried
[1:50:37] yes I'm no other way ah that was nothing
[1:50:40] they don't know what they're doing now
[1:50:41] the sudden they're oh boy
[1:50:46] our Mean Tweets haven't stopped them
[1:50:48] from building
[1:50:49] are hurtful words haven't stopped the
[1:50:51] work
[1:50:52] we've tried to we've tried to instigate
[1:50:54] problems we've tried to cause trouble
[1:50:56] we've made fun of them called every kind
[1:50:58] of name in the book called them holy
[1:51:00] rollers and they still build it and now
[1:51:01] it's about done what are we gonna do you
[1:51:04] ain't gonna do nothing you can do
[1:51:06] nothing you were unable to do nothing
[1:51:08] and you still can't do anything that's
[1:51:10] why the work of God remains Satan and
[1:51:13] the powers of Darkness he cannot stop
[1:51:15] you because you come from God and you're
[1:51:18] going back to God
[1:51:22] the critics their mouths get shot when
[1:51:25] God begins to do the work
[1:51:27] and now they're sitting there I love
[1:51:29] this because the Bible says all the
[1:51:31] Heathen that were around about Jerusalem
[1:51:33] they begin to look down on the enemies
[1:51:35] of Nehemiah because they saw the work
[1:51:37] that God was with them
[1:51:41] listen God will humiliate your enemies
[1:51:44] hey man when even the unbeliever can
[1:51:47] look at your life and say God did
[1:51:48] something there no man could do that
[1:51:50] amen
[1:51:51] why am I
[1:51:54] just a matter of time
[1:51:57] it's just just be patient it's just a
[1:51:59] matter of time to your enemy realizes it
[1:52:02] doesn't matter he can't stop it he can't
[1:52:04] do anything to you amen there's nothing
[1:52:06] he can do to stop God
[1:52:09] there's nothing he can do to stop you
[1:52:14] start the work
[1:52:15] God started he's gonna finish it
[1:52:18] hey man
[1:52:19] just stand to your feet
[1:52:27] just bow your heads for a moment
[1:52:29] I want you to
[1:52:32] maybe look in your own life and you can
[1:52:34] think of the different times that you
[1:52:36] lost patience
[1:52:38] God or yourself
[1:52:39] maybe you're in that situation today
[1:52:42] you're getting ready to go to church or
[1:52:44] whatever it is
[1:52:46] think about all the times you've failed
[1:52:48] God
[1:52:49] think about all the things that you
[1:52:50] haven't done think about how how
[1:52:52] inadequate you are thinking about how
[1:52:53] unworthy you are
[1:52:56] but that's not what he said about you
[1:52:58] he testified that you're worthy through
[1:53:01] the blood of Christ
[1:53:03] he testified of your Valley when he
[1:53:05] purchased you with the blood of Jesus
[1:53:06] Christ
[1:53:07] he testifies today of your worth with
[1:53:10] his patience
[1:53:12] that he's shown toward you
[1:53:15] God likes you
[1:53:16] God designed you with an intent God
[1:53:19] designed you with a purpose you're
[1:53:21] valuable in God's sight
[1:53:23] take all your misgivings
[1:53:25] take all your insecurity and
[1:53:28] just throw it back on the enemy say you
[1:53:30] know what
[1:53:31] Nehemiah
[1:53:32] he was sent Letters by the enemy he said
[1:53:34] listen I don't have time for that
[1:53:36] I don't have time to talk to the enemy
[1:53:37] the work is too great
[1:53:40] you don't have time today to negotiate
[1:53:42] and talk with the Enemy you let them
[1:53:44] know you know what the work of God which
[1:53:46] I am a work of God I'm a part of the
[1:53:48] work of God it's too important to
[1:53:50] entertain your criticisms it's too
[1:53:53] important to entertain misgivings it's
[1:53:55] too important God
[1:53:57] has designed me with a purpose God
[1:54:01] has given me a vision
[1:54:03] my desire your desire today let it be
[1:54:05] let us rise up
[1:54:07] above criticism let's rise up above
[1:54:09] misgivings let's rise up above the hurt
[1:54:12] that we've gone through let's rise up
[1:54:14] above our our tragedies and let us build
[1:54:19] we're going to set ourselves to build
[1:54:21] this good work it's worth it it's worth
[1:54:23] it Saints it's worth everything we could
[1:54:25] give to him He's Worthy
[1:54:27] he's worthy let's pray oh Lord you're
[1:54:30] worthy today
[1:54:33] Lord I don't regret one mile I walked
[1:54:35] for you
[1:54:37] Lord there's no no prayer that I pray
[1:54:40] that I regret
[1:54:43] Lord there's no
[1:54:45] there's no time
[1:54:47] nothing I've given to you that I look
[1:54:49] back and wish I could take back
[1:54:50] Lord my my only regret in life is I
[1:54:53] haven't given you more
[1:54:55] on the desires I want to give you more
[1:54:56] Lord that's our desire today
[1:54:58] I believe for every sincere Christian
[1:55:00] here today Lord we just want to devote
[1:55:03] ourselves more to the work
[1:55:06] but we want to we want to be patient
[1:55:08] with you
[1:55:10] we want to be patient with ourselves
[1:55:12] with our brother our sister sitting next
[1:55:14] to us
[1:55:17] Lord there's a there's a purpose in that
[1:55:19] life
[1:55:21] there were when you made that life there
[1:55:23] was an intention in your mind
[1:55:26] something that each one of us would
[1:55:28] fulfill
[1:55:31] and Lord if we could just come into a
[1:55:33] Unity of that purpose or that intention
[1:55:36] I believe there'd be divine Harmony in
[1:55:38] the world
[1:55:39] the very Redemption of the earth is
[1:55:41] resting upon the manifestation of the
[1:55:45] sons of God
