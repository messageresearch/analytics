some of you look at me strange you all passed through that didn't you you were awake enough to realize it was cold outside today my we had this change in weather for some things i'm happy in the change of weather but other things you know this time of the year we we enjoy it but my goodness it seems like it just comes with such a quickness when it gets cold and but we have such a we know this is a season and a cycle you go through after you know the flowers that we've enjoyed and everything they've if they've served their purpose they'll come back in the spring if it's if it that flower you know just because it's a flower doesn't mean it's going to come back that flower's got to be germatized if that flower has been germatized then the spring itself only vindicates the secret work that was done in the summer buried in the winter and the summer itself its presence only makes manifest the work that was already done and that's the same way it does with the resurrection of jesus christ the presence of god it only vindicates is the working placing of his word and of our lives amen just to get into his presence when we get into his presence we begin to recognize that sounds like home that sounds like home there's something about it that resonates out that's that's what i'm longing for is home amen oh it's just good it's just good to be in the house of the lord good to serve the lord jesus i want to just uh first of all want to make mention of a few things i want to just welcome the vivian's sister and we want to let your sister correct you and we um to extend our condolences the loss um sister here she had lost her her husband here and we you remember the prayer request a few weeks back and so we want to continue we've been praying for you and we want to continue to pray for them and god would just continue to comfort them and to strengthen them in this time amen god bless you so good to have you here i want to also make mention of um next next sunday the lord willing will have a fellowship dinner there at the presbyterian church right on right off 58 the address and things are posted there on the announcements that went out for the october events it's on the bulletin board in the restrooms as well as in your email maybe we can also get that on facebook as well also please keep in mind uh the meetings coming up in the second weekend of november there we'll have with brother wayne lawson on november 13th and 14th and we just have been planning on that and just that the lord wills and we just want to keep that in prayer as well i think that's it this morning if we could if we just turn in the scriptures to deuteronomy chapter 16. and so good to be in the presence of the lord amen so good i want to just we're going to just read a few verses of scripture here this morning and maybe before we read let's just ask let's just invite the author that even as we're reading god would just begin to just quicken these things to our hearts and just set our our minds and our spirit in the right direction amen to receive from him heavenly father lord we just want to say we we love you lord jesus how we so appreciate you lord thank you for your mercy and your grace lord to our lives oh god i i thank the lord in this time in the moment that we're living in lord what a privileged lord what a privileged people we are lord certainly not because of anything that we've done not because of how good we are or how good we could ever be lord our righteousness is as described oh god by the prophet lord in the old testament is but filthy rags in your sight lord but we're thankful god that we're not coming today or approaching on the merits of our righteousness but we're coming on the righteousness of almighty god that's been revealed through jesus christ and lord we just look to you father and you just move among us in a special way lord those things that you've laid on my heart god just quickened lord to me i'm asking that lord that you'll come you're the difference maker lord lord in a service oh god you're the one who makes the difference lord and we just invite you if if we could hear this morning lord one that would read something and they would want to know and say god i want to know lord you're the one you're the author of your word we just want to invite you oh god to where we're sitting we want to invite you lord to our heart invite you o god this moment lord the very god lord who is alone able to interpret and reveal his word and lord with that revealing dissolve every doubt oh god may you just come this morning in a very special and personal way oh god and may our hearts just be set lord and implying god to you for lord you said if we would draw nine to you you will draw nine to us o god we ask the lord that you'll just move among us in a very special way o god and we ask it for the glory of god now in jesus name amen amen deuteronomy 16 verse 1 observe the month of abeth which would be the month of april and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there i want to just really emphasize that thou shalt offer the sacrifice but only in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there amen you can offer it many other places but god will only accept it in the place where he's chose to place his name just give you an example it would be like if you you know we have mailboxes that are set up i'm talking about those blue um places where you put your mail so you see them sometimes you see them by a school you see them sometimes they don't have to go to a post office right now you can you can look and you could see one of those blue things set up but if there is no u.s postal service seal on the outside of that you could say i mailed my taxes i sent them in but the only way that those taxes actually make it or whatever document is you've got to put it in a place that is recognized by the post office that'll come pick it up and get it there you see what that seal does upon there when you see that seal it separates that blue receptacle from every other blue receptacle the seal is what gives you confidence and god seals himself his word by his presence [Music] thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou came us forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest observe mayest remember the day when thou came us forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee and all thy coast seven days neither shall there anything of the flesh which thou sacrificeth the first day of even remain all night unto the morning there's many parts within there but i don't want to get off on those today thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee so god has given them these gates but god has said there's only one gate where i'll receive the worship and you won't have to guess you won't have to wonder i will place my name in that gate but at the name but at the place verse 6 which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou came us forth out of egypt and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the lord thy god shall choose and thou shalt turn in the morning and go into thy tents six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the lord thy god thou shalt do no work therein amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to say that i mentioned to the church here on thursday that we just so appreciated the prayers that even as we were gone and we were praying for you here and for the services and just so thankful to god's mercy to bring us back together i want to speak this morning we've been dealing with a thought here as god has been leading us on the testimony of our lives but i want to just hone in on this this part of it this morning satisfied thirst and hunger satisfied thirst and hunger and when we think of the scriptures that we've read here god also mentioned this very thing in deuteronomy 12. god let it be known that we're where he places his name this should be the place that the people would seek to that place now this message of deuteronomy 16 deuteronomy 12 it wasn't for everybody this was to israel the rest of the nations and the gentile nations at that time it had no meaning to them as a matter of fact god did not it was not uh a message that went out to them but god in grace showed glimpses that even in times when things were taking place in israel there would be intervals where gentiles would be brought in which was a type of the interval of time from when israel was blinded and they rejected that of the messiah there would be an interval of time that god would take a gentile bride the same thing you look like as you look in the book of ruth ruth chapter one is naomi ruth chapter four naomi in between is the bride so there is an interval in the time that god was showing even when the occupation of coming into the promised land here god sends out a word israel is coming in to possess what belongs to him but god sends out a word and there is a gentile there by the name of rahab that is desiring has heard about the living god and hearing about the living god has started to raise something within her that god placed within her before the foundation of the world and so in the midst of this time of coming into the land there was a small interval where god does a short quick work and takes to himself rahab a gentile so knowing the wise i say that with this in mind these things that are wrote in the old testament were tights and shadows that was speaking of a positive that was to come there was a place where god remember when they came over into the land the god placed his name in shiloh or had them to set up their the tabernacle in shiloh and god's place of rest was right there in shiloh shiloh meaning rest then the second place that he would now god would remove his name from there and he would place his name in jerusalem jerusalem being that of peace and and to recognize that it first must come a rest in our soul now which leads us to the peace of god which will lead us into that place of the millennium and the future home so all of us we must follow god in every step of the way and where god is at presently that's the desire of the believer that's the desire of a child of god is to know god and i want to just say as this was types there was an antitype or that which was pointing to what the true representation was and that true representation is the lord jesus christ himself it's just like you know when you see a shadow on a wall and there's a shadow on the wall well the shadow if you see put your hand up and there's a shadow cast on that wall the shadow is not your hand but the shadow is only a reflection that of what is actually real and true and that's the hand you see all through the old testament there was the shadows and tights of the lord jesus as well as the bride and once it moves from the shadow to where it's no longer obscure but now it becomes the real true reality amen see here brother brown says it like this and i want you to just to just to take this in i don't i just some of these i'm just going to preach from brother braham says now if god chose a place it behooves us to find out what he said about it where is it i want to find out because truly i want to worship him amen amen you know i don't think there's anybody who would be sitting here or for that matter i'm just going to go on go out maybe on a limb i don't believe that anybody just wants to just just uh you know do something just of just to do it i believe we're here to seek out truth we want to know it's something in our heart that wants to know we want to know the ground that we're standing on is solid ground because storms are going to count is that right like he said here you eat the bread of affliction testing trials will come right but jesus said what matters where were resting whether we're resting on a rock or sand storms are going to come it's if the storm itself only proves that a believer is a believer and only shows that for a life that maybe hasn't went deep enough are you with me because we can't blame storms on a lack of victory we're all here and look notice what jesus said the the profound statements when he was here knowing that there were people desiring to know the truth he stood before pilate and pilate asked the question what is truth you see a question was asked in that time for even a man to ask a question like that and to recognize the very truth was staring him right in the face it was right in the face jesus did not have to go and go through a whole lecture series it isn't words that break god down it is in words that reveal god but god comes on the scene and reveals himself in his word through his word by his word amen because you see remember what jesus said he said here i am come in my father's name the very life the very promise that was wrote in the scriptures is being made manifest through my life and you call me an evil spirit he was manifesting that word but he says if another will come in his own name his own interpretation his own arrangement of scriptures you will receive him and whatever is received will be reflected this is why the baptists reflect baptists this is why pentecost reflect pentecostal this is why methodists reflect mad methodists and with me they take on that identity they identify with that doctrine identify with that creed and they move no further and yet the pillar of fire was there at one point revealing himself in a station of the word but the pillar of firm moves on god is working to bring a full restoration amen is that right so jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free somebody say the truth the truth shall make you free the truth is not a doctrine the truth is the person of jesus christ he said i am the way the truth and the lies not one of them not a value menu where you choose whatever value meal you want or how you want to arrange it i'm not a value menu jesus said i am the way the truth and the life [Applause] what does that do it puts it back in our lap do you want the way do you want the truth do you want the life yes you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now you see before you can do anything brother brahman says it's simple like this before he says you can do anything you you don't know what to do until you know how to do it i want you just let's let the holy spirit uncover just unfold these things to us this morning you don't know what to do until you know how to do it you must know what you're doing and how to do it it's just like let me just drop this and move on it's just like in receiving the baptism of the holy ghost you've got to know how and you can't you must anointed until you must first know what to do and then how to do it jesus said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now that seems very simple it is very simple but what you realize is the holy ghost will never come into a sinful life amen right right a lot of times with kings it's like i'm going over we're preaching some things on on friday night with the young people there we wonder about why don't i have the holy ghost you have to first come to a complete confession and a repentance you can't say god i got all this stuff in my life i need the holy ghost but god has made a way that if you really want the holy ghost you can invite the very cleanser himself to come in your life and say god clean my life up lord i want to be sanctified that i can be filled with you lord god that's consecrating to god [Music] you can worship god in your gates but god ain't going to receive worship unless it's in the gate he places his name so you must know what you're doing and how to do and this is where the enemy likes to try to mess with people and try to mess with the young people try to mess with them because they'll come to an altar and look i believe in altar calls i believe in all that my point is within this is that they're coming god i need the holy ghost but it's like coming with all this stuff that's in my arms and i've got all this right here and i'm saying jesus i need the holy ghost jesus i need the holy ghost and i got all this stuff right you've got to let him take it you've got to confess you've got to confess and repent and allow him to come and cleanse those things out of your life you see many times we've looked at things like the holy ghost and just said well you know god i mean i'm so sorry and i can't do nothing and i i just need the holy ghost and if i had the holy ghost in the lord i could do all this but god wants remember consecration god looks at you and i and says how bad do you want it are you willing to cut things off in your life you might say i can't get rid of this but there you're in the presence of a god that you can invite in your life he'll cut every time he'll sanctify your life he'll make you a fit place for himself to come and dwell in amen well i didn't just drop that we preached it a little bit but i just got to do it as it comes god notice god has a meeting place for his worshipers in one certain place and in that place only god meets his worshipers so where god has chose to place his name now what is his name well you say his name is jesus that's god coming down and taking on a human name so he could relate to us that's how he's our high priest are you with me after the rapture we will not need that form of relationship right now that's why that god became man god became us to an extent to where that he can relate to us as a brother he can relate to us as a friend god became that not a separate person but god himself unfolded himself to that place that he might know and understand you and i as a merciful and faithful high priest that's why great is the mystery of godliness notice his name is his very life the very person of himself because when i call a name you think of a person right i mean you know sometimes you might call out somebody's name i know how it was when i was in teaching you know you called out a certain name and they call who who i'm not gonna call their names here but i said wait a minute are you talking about so-and-so and i'd identify their last name yep one of the same oh boy good luck this year you got them in your class good luck i'll be praying for you because there's a lot of people that can have that first name hello somebody but the last name is the surname which is the family name that right there puts an identity right there and that's how it is with the family of god it's the last name that matters where god puts that last name there and it is his own life see you so it's on his name it's who it is you see he would confirm this chosen place he was vindicated by his presence this is why you hear the prophet when he's standing there and he's getting ready in the opening of the seals and he makes this statement he says in this time he said not only must it come by revelation but by divine vindication also you see why because there's been much revelation loose ends that were scattered are you with me this is why when the old brother branham pulled here but brother man didn't pull there that was god assembling what god had revealed and god laid all of that there for this moment and this hour so now it's coming by divine revelation and vindication of his very person what is that that's the seal of the living god where god is putting his seal upon his own message that's why this message is not the message of william branham it isn't that the sense that god used that vessel but this is the message of the living god from the crown of almighty god the message of god that is sent to call sons and daughters of god into the family of almighty god hallelujah oh my it's a gathering that's going on in this hour and god is a great unchanging god and he can't change i like that don't you amen that's the only place we can have confidence in this hour we're living in it ought to be more real that's right brother brown picks it up in the message uncertain sound and through that whole time you know even when kennedy was elected brother brown picks that up and part starts preaching those messages on uncertain sound he points out there's uncertainty in everything that's around us but you see god has it that way are you hearing me don't get caught up in that don't get trying to look out there is no certain ground out there i don't care how a man's persona is how much a man could raise his hand and say i swear i will do this and i promise to do this and i promise you that you don't see the back room deals come on friends even in the hour that we're living in sure the previous president many good things that were done but there was catholics that was put on that supreme court as well are you hearing me it's filled with catholics now roman catholics [Music] [Applause] it shows within these things that even don't ever put your hopes in any man never you put your hope and your trust in almighty god that's where we're to draw our strength from there's no other place of confidence that's how we're to live our lives even as families fathers husbands mothers brothers sisters we should be a confidence that when we address things in our home it ought to be addressed by the word of god it ought to be a life that's lived by the word of god you say what's that doing that is producing a confidence in the word of god you say they don't even got the holy ghost yet but brother branham tells us you are to be their holy ghost until they get old enough to receive it it would bring a confidence in the word amen my lord i don't know if we're going to get to where we're going to get to today or not the only thing i can have confidence in is in the bible because whenever god acted one time you see it all the way through the scriptures however god acted one time right he ever he ever you know accepted a man that come to him for salvation and the basis he accepted him on god will do the same thing again and again and again and again he said i'm god and i changed not all right amen man one man changes how does man change because when man doesn't meet god then man will come in and they approach the word by their intellects reasonings and feelings boy we're living in a time that don't hurt nobody's feelings we're living in a time that everything's so hyped up emotionally listen that is a sign of the time is that right that's a sign of the time that's taking place even in this hour but to recognize that when a man really meets god that man meets god because there's a confidence he that cometh to god must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so that way must be opened up the living god must be set before us so we can actually come to a place to really seek after who it is that our heart is longing for aren't you glad that god makes a way you and i can never have found it i'll tell you what this is how our lives were it'd be just like you trying to go to some city in some state you take away your phone your gps my goodness all the tools we've got now you'd have to be dumb not to find somewhere they got stuff turned here turn there turn here turn there approaching the light stop here go through this slide do this i mean they've got things so far you can actually go back and go to sleep in your car and pretty soon you know how the auto pilots but i don't want one of them no that's a little carnal but i don't want one of those things right there but to think all these things that are before us roadmaps i remember when my daddy would get out the big rand mcnally atlas and we would go through and plan the trip and it had the little boxes you know on the interstate and that little white box with the number next to it 152 it was an exit now you could go and start planning on that there were certain things about you know what well i think we're going to do go drive halfway we're going to stop about this exit right here it was a pathway or a road map that you knew where you were going and you knew glory be to god there were junctions or stopping places along the way and that's exactly what god himself does he don't leave you and out of wonder he opens and reveals the way and lets you and i know there are junctions there are places so you're not wondering lord am i very editor lord and you know i i wanna i really wanna serve you but you can actually begin to look in your life and say praise god i might still have the things in my life but i know that i have seen him and i want to be sanctified and then you come to the next place and knowing on the pathway that god you're the god that cleans me up lord i want to surrender all of my life and hear you move into that place and then you come to the next part and say god lord take me in lord baptize me into the body what is it you've got a clear road map sometimes on that road map you got to stick to it yeah because you get off on that road map you know how it is we've all had relatives that want to tell us i'll take a shortcut yeah right [Laughter] well we're going to take the scenic route they meant it all right you're going to be seeing scenery for days but see god ain't interested in taking us on shortcuts because there's no shortcuts into the body of jesus christ [Music] man might offer shortcuts handshake sign this that's shortcuts that's not god's way amen god has made a basis now let's look here in the scripture let's look here in john chapter 4 verse 7. here in john chapter 4 verse 7 hear the lord jesus he reserves he holds himself back when the rest of the disciples they need to go get food right why do they need food hungry anybody still get hungry don't raise your hand if you're hungry right now because i am too but that ain't even on my thoughts right now but i know right but natural natural hunger nothing wrong with going to get something to eat is that right they needed to go do that that was a natural thirst in their life even the lord jesus himself remember he got hungry even in the temptations and so forth now here is it comes into here the lord jesus there's an appointment that has been arranged this is an appointment that god himself has made in his great appointment book before the foundation of the world before the devil was ever the devil before there was adam stardust molecule for there was angels or anything else this appointment book brother vivian was already set it's like you know when you you get into things sometimes there was just you know some months ago a brother had called me and i was out in other meetings asked me and said hey brother samuel could you come and do this particular meeting for us and i said brother i'll pray about it i i think right now i'd be all right to do that and i began to look at and i had already done it one time already this this year already and had to call a brother and say you know what i can't come because that's my son's graduation so i'm sorry brother i had committed to coming but fortunately i was only a couple days later you know i could you know you get out of that but i i looked at it and i thought well i thought you know i i think i can do it you know inspiration i begin to feel inspiration and i always wait for that too you know my in my sense is there inspiration that god has given me towards that and so when i begin to look at it i begin to talk with my wife and but something would not allow me to commit to it and i finally i pulled up my you know your google calendar and i pulled it up and i realized because i have to put everything in there i know i'm only 46 years old but i got to put everything in there even when one of you all asked me hey brother samuel can you call me on a certain date that's why many times that it might seem like i'm going blank but i'm putting it there on the calendar so i don't forget i got to looking brother joey and i thought something don't sound right and i got to looking in there and i realized oh i've got a youth meeting already scheduled at my house for that date so i called the brother up i said no i said the young people i said i already have a meeting with my young people it's been planned i said a month out in advance i said so brother i said i'm sorry i said but i'm sure you can get somebody else i'll be praying for the meeting and so forth but i want i'm right here so when you begin to look at that i'll give you that little example as it would come to me of how that god himself hear the appointment book that was made in the mind of god from before the foundation of the world and here the lord jesus himself is now god manifested on earth to keep every appointment now i can tell you right now with the person that he's getting ready to interact with there were many people that had appointments with her but they didn't have good appointments are you with me there were many people that would not have even had an appointment not even given her the time of day you were telling me we don't even know this we don't even know this little woman's name but if you were to mention her name in town no doubt many would know oh no no no no not her not her no no not her they would not want to give her the time of day but you see now there's an appointment that's taking place because now here god's word is on the scene now what's needed this word being on the scene meaning the living god himself in the fulfillment of his word is now coming and here is one of his words that is laying in seed form in her life and now he's coming into a place to bring the living reality of the living god to her you know why because she's got a thirst and a hunger amen notice in verse seven there cometh for woman of samaria to draw water jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy me then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew asketh drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans there's nobody can cross can conquer racial divides like jesus are you with me right amen john 4 10 jesus answered and said unto her if thou newest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water now right here i'm sure she's not aware of what's going on but if we could actually go back and pull her up right now she could tell you that there was something that was different at that moment there was a presence about that man that this man that what she saw was just a man but there was a respect and a love that was emanating glory be to god from this man that she had never since before but yet it's what she craved oh glory be to god and here she is standing there and he's trying to alert her to the place if thou knewest the gift of god god's gift it's god himself the holy ghost and the holy ghost operating in his word you see it wasn't so much that that she would recognize or you know many times people think well if i could only see jesus and they're looking for a corporal body will only see the corporal body if you've been united with him in the form of his word by the baptism of the holy ghost because the holy spirit is what that's who god is that's who the lord jesus is are you with me he says i go away and then i will come again and i will receive you unto myself so the holy ghost is the same person of jesus christ that's now being revealed in his word just as he was in luke chapter 24 remember their eyes were withholding that they shouldn't know him and yet he's the very one that they fished with slept around and everything else they didn't know him their eyes were withholding but he took them into the word and he began to reveal himself in his promised word and confirmed that to them why because they must as believers recognize him in the fulfillment of his word and because they recognized him in the fulfillment of his word what did the word tell him he told him go up to jerusalem wait until you be endued with power from on high amen you see the vindicated word the living word will always call you and i to a living word experience it's not enough just to know the living word but to understand the purpose of the living word coming that you might have a living word experience let me tell you something many people can know brother branham was a prophet the devil knows that the bible says that the devil believes that jesus is god the christ and he trembles come on the devil ain't no make-believer that guy's a believer he believes but there's one thing in different between the devil and that of a believer the devil can never ever become a full-fledged holy ghost born believer he can never get where you are when you've been baptized with the holy ghost why he'd have to repent he'd have to be baptized he'd have to come the same way and if he does that he would mar his inheritance are you with me he would marry who he is notice give me to drink he's you would say give me notice you would ask give me to drink and thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given the living water is this simple if you knew who it was it's talking you would ask give me drink yes give me drink give me this living water so verse 11 notice sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water see he's getting her to open up he's getting her to open art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the will and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle and jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water speaking out of that well shall thirst again what's he dealing with natural desire natural thirst now think about this whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst well this is a different kind of thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman said unto him sir give me this water that i first not neither come hether to draw amen now remember she's still looking at it in a natural way but what is taking place by being there as an attribute of god she doesn't realize this she does not know exactly who it is she really is her true identity but the word knows who she is and the word is moving in her life and though her understanding is not complete in this moment but her understanding at that time she knows i need a living water i need something that's real i'm tired of doing the same thing again and again and again and again i want that living water i'm thirsty you know what thirst is it's a painful desire this young woman she had a painful desire now she had natural thirst water food all those things are in our life that we have natural desires for let me tell you brother brad would bring this down he said it's a natural desire for a woman to want to look pretty so natural god has put that in that's not sinful but what makes it sinful is when satan starts interpreting what pretty is right and anything satan gets a hold of it's a perversion because what everything that satan does when he he takes the women maybe he don't strip them off he just skins it down in them tight winter weener dresses where every form and figure and everything else is all around and then they wonder why why do i get the kind of looks i get why do i get the man i get or this or that because the man is not attracted to the character he's attracted to what's on display i'm going to preach and how is it coming you see what it is that love that beauty that desire it's nothing wrong with wanting to look beautiful but you remember while you adorn yourself on the end on the outside should match the character that's on the inside the outside is only a reflection of the true character on the inside the character that is in submission and subjection to the word of god that's why a real woman cannot say well yes i'm in subjection to god and they still wear all sorts of things of the world painting their face and doing everything else why because the inner person is still not in subjection to the word of god but when the inside one gets in subjection to the word of god it'll show on the outside i don't want to come here no more but now she's probably going to have to go back to that well to get natural water but what jesus here is tapping into is to bring a deliverance to her life because another natural desire that she has is to be loved brother brown picks that up in the message thirst he said for a young person it's a natural desire to be loved natural desire he said to avoid a woman to want a husband vice versa young man natural desires but you see upon those natural desires how satan would love to come and come at those natural desires so much so that this this little lady that we're reading about she wouldn't been regarded as a lady at this time by the people of the city but you look at how what jesus is going to start dealing with now he's moving into this place to where this spiritual thirst he's dealing with a spiritual thirst and now he's going to deal with where the root of the problem i'm so glad that jesus helps you and i to know amen oh lord i want to know the way well you can't know what to do until you know how to do it notice what he does jesus said unto her go call your husband and come hither and the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband you see what's happened the word is dealing with those things that satan has perverted to try to quench that holy thirst she's been with man after man after man look you can flip it around and talk about man being with woman after a woman or looking upon things and every trying to satisfy a holy thirst that god put there some will turn to looking at things on the internet some will turn to you know the bottle or drugs or anything else what is it they're trying to satisfy that thirst that god put in there let me tell you something a church didn't put that thirst in you your mom and daddy didn't put that thirst in you the prophet didn't put that thirst in you that thirst was in you all the time in your life and that's why you searched here you searched there you saw glory be to god as a young person you tried this friend you tried that friend you tried this and you try that but there's nothing could satisfy that why it's not a natural desire it's a spiritual desire that only god himself can satisfy [Music] let me read the next verse here for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou asked is not thy husband in that in that said is thou true see what he's the words identifying it's identifying the attributes of unbelief that's been in her life what are those attributes and remember all the attributes smoking drinking all those things those are only attributes of one sin unbelief amen it's unbelief so now that undoubt that unbelief it's being addressed did you see what one is down there notice notice the approach here remember he said if you would have asked me if you ask i will give you this living water now what's he dealing with it's kind of like i stepped out here with all them bottles in my arms right right but he identifies go call your husband now she had a choice at that time she could have took her water pot and said you know what you ain't getting in my private life all right i'm going to worship god but you ain't touching my private life but here she is in the presence of god hallelujah and she confesses what the word has spoken she doesn't try to get away from it she doesn't try to run around it it's a sacred moment there between her and god i tell you friends that is such a blessing to a believer that when god can come down and the heart and the life and the believer can say yes lord that's true that's my life lord god that's exactly where i'm at that is a blessing if she would not have done that in the story she could have continued to come to jacob's well and she remained thirsty spiritually what would the end of being well it kind of seems like that where the pattern is going that after a period of time that we could if we had a sheet of stopped right here and walked away she might eventually been on her 13th husband hello somebody i mean we know marriage and divorce is still wrong is that right it's the word of god god is coming to deal with these situations that's right here present in the word of god and we don't believe marriage and divorce the way that the bad that the way the world wants to interpret it that when you get tired of somebody you divorce them and get somebody else that is not god's order amen it gets down pretty pretty sticky and pretty tight as well because i know a lot of times a man wants to feel like well you know my wife ran out on me so i got a right to remarry but what about if you in your life were not living a real godly life in your home i'm not talking about just warming a church pew i'm not talking about just associating around the message but you weren't sorry enough to live a real godly life then you are guilty yes sir there is an answer for these things there is a remedy i pray for god's grace friends but this woman right here if this thirst if she walked away and said you're not dealing with that area of my life she would have continued on and it would have been worse for her that's right she might have found a millionaire of her dreams she might have the rich young ruler built more barns after he turned jesus down his stocks went up he became so profitable yeah as i said with the young people there on thursday night here was a young man that could stand in the face of the lord jesus and not a finger laid on his life he knew the message he knew the prophet moses but he had it maybe on his head as an ornament of grace had it has chains about his neck he had it all written upon you know upon his heart he had all these things i've hid it in my heart but what he didn't have it because he couldn't get there yet was down into the innermost part of his heart in his soul to wear to the word it was not something out here as a natural adornment but it became a living reality on the inside of his life and eventually that rich young ruler he took the crumbs remember thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself he took the crumbs gave it to dogs over top of lazarus victory you would wonder why how man he's been raised in a message how could he get away from it because where the message was at in his life was not where it should the be was here it was in spirit in his spirit oh he knew it but satan will come to test where is it in your life where is it at in your life is it really the anchor and the absolute of your life but saying you know that's pretty straight we're interested in getting to the other side we're not interested in pats on the back i just heard the prophet of god say it last night when that woman was dying there and here she was she had lived every way she wanted to live sunday school teacher played the music on instruments in church she was patted on the back and everything else but when it came time for her to die and eventually when that soul caught up with her she realized go get the pastor she said i'm lost and the pastor what did he come in and do he said give her another shot of hypo she said get out of here you deceiver you've lied to me her soul was exposed the soul that sinneth shall die oh god be merciful oh jesus notice where the word is doing she's receiving leadership because the word is dealing with her life to lead her into a place to where she's agreeing with the word you know you first have to come into agreeance with the word that's the grace of god even a new heart and a new spirit is a new way of thinking amen is that right so god's leading he's trying what's he doing he's getting that old nature to agree with him then here she begins to side with the word that's true lord right see she's starting at the right place she's believing it the next thing is a complete and thorough repentance i want you to think about it that infidel that brother branham was out there hunting look how brother branham was blood squirrel all over him probably looked like we do sometimes coming out of the wood blood on our fingernails and stuff and dirt and every it wouldn't have been you as a man that's a respectable man of god brother brown here he has beard on his face right he stands there and begins to talk to that man who's known as an infidel i want you to watch this approach brother branham never ever condemns that man you know why he's going to point him by the grace of god to the source that'll help him all right that's good he's going to point him to the source that's going to help him right now you're wrong but you're wrong you're this i don't do nothing right matter of fact he wouldn't have been a hunt there right well that fellow wasn't knowing something from kentucky he might have got scanned right there but instead he begins to speak to this man but using god's one of god's first bibles nature and god begins to unfold himself because this man don't know chapters he don't know scriptures he don't even if he didn't know that he still needs to know the living god and it begins to unfold right there in that time what happens that man as he begins to agree brother brother man begins to talk to him you know how it goes on brother man starts talking to him and said well he says now he said you know you put water on that post and well why don't the water go down he said i never thought that before see what's he doing getting him to think is that right then he starts talking you know but first the first thing about it before brother brown went into that i hope it's all right because if not we're still going here anyhow but brother branham began remembering the man said you know what there is a preacher one time i'd like to ask him a few questions because he goes into a testimony of what happened on the hill over there and what did brother bram say you don't believe that do you man said i know one thing that woman was bedfast was bedridden and i know one thing she ate that way no more brother said really you believe that brother that said see what's happening he said he's starting to decide what's he doing he's opening up why there was a thirst down there in that man's life hallelujah and brother branham began to stand there as an instrument and begin to preach that of god revealing himself hiding himself in nature right there in that apple tree until eventually brother branham said when you can tell me the the one that causes the sack to go in the roots and stay there until the winters pass then i will tell you how that was done up there he said you're not that preacher he said i am would you recognize his name if i told you he said sure he said my name is william brattle he said that's it right there right there that man was led to the lord it wasn't in a church building but the lord jesus was on the grounds right there at sportsman's hollow [Music] this woman let me try to finish this sir i perceive that you're a prophet oh my things are being uncovered in our life there's a presence about it the presence of the lord our fathers notice now questions our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in this jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto here woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is notice its transition time when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him notice it's not just spirit it's not just truth either a person could have a law have all truth and no god present right they can have spirit and no truth at all now friends listen don't tell me they're getting under their own i know sometimes there's evil spirits but sometimes even with different things where they can they get under the anointing of the holy spirit who do you think it is that when they go pray for people and people are made are made whole it ain't the person who's laid hands on them no more it is your hands it's the person's faith in god amen is that right but if it's just in spirit are you hearing me now there's no life to back it up yet it can claim spirit spirit but yet the life is contrary to the word and remember what it'll fall back on is well praise god i've got gifts in my life praise god i shout praise god i do this and praise god i do that but no spirit and truth it's resting on the anointing of the spirit upon the flesh upon the spirit upon their mind is that right jesus said many will come to me in that day and they will give a whole list and i not done this i did this i did that i did this i did that i did this and jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity for i never knew you relationship but then again a person could have truth form of godliness but deny the power thereof god have truth oh we have all the mysteries we understand all this we are we have all the truth but no dynamics and no life same shape i said same shape [Music] jesus said true worshipers are those who will worship me in spirit and in truth between some the pharisees had truth as far as scriptures they had words down they knew all of this they you go man you could just push the button and they'd rehearse the psalm they had their lives were such a rehearsed life right and the sad thing about it is that's all it was was no more than a rehearsed lifestyle they knew the tenants knew what to do here knew what to do here but they couldn't recognize the god of the word oh friends i'm telling you what a privileged people that you and i are is to recognize god for who he really is when you recognize that the message and you see what god has done for us in this hour that the message is not a bank of doctrine but the message is god himself come down to the church of the living god to reveal himself in his word and to make himself known to the believers that you can too have a living word experience what does what does his presence do it raises the certainty of his promise this young woman she wants to worship everybody agree with that she wants to worship she wants to worship the living god there's a desire that she has within her life now let me just let me read a little something here before i before i move on here sometimes you wonder and you look sometimes in situations that sometimes a person or people can come into you can look at it and say oh this person or this or that but sometimes not that it makes exceptions or we compromise but sometimes when you know some of the background on it you can step back and say wow how great is our god brother brown goes into her life and he says this little woman ill-famed we call her sometimes a prostitute notice this sometimes maybe the child had been turned out on the street sometimes like now it ain't altogether juvenile delinquents it's parent delinquents let the little lady get out and act like that you know what that says to me it's a responsibility as parents brother brown says you keep this is direct words from the prophet brother adam what should we allow our kids what kind of activities should we allow our teenagers to participate in direct quote he said you make sure you keep them in christian company as long as you can amen that's direct words i believe that you understand i believe that brother brown says you wonder why this one gets out and becomes a thief who they're hanging around are you with me this puts such a responsibility to recognize that has they just they just turned around brother saying i ain't turning them out but it's to lead them also in the right way oh brother samuel i believe the message what do your footsteps say what do our footsteps say remember the little boy coming home behind his dad little boy was doing this falling in the snow and that man looked back he kind of sobered up a little bit what are you doing just following you daddy right in your footsteps see children only know the value of what you say is valuable are you hearing me rocco you know what i'm you know i'm getting ready to say sister maria different ones that's been in school you could sit there and i could you could tell sometimes when you had maybe a parent or somebody come in they had a bad experience in school yeah right when they had a bad experience in school they already started with with things within teachers and so because maybe they had a bad experience then there was not a value that they held within that of education and then you try to start talking about education or other things like that they don't have no value to it but why is that you can't say well you're wrong you should have no no no but what about the background that's right maybe they had something in school maybe there was a teacher that abused them maybe there was a teacher that said something about them that you're dumb you'll never make anything come on brother graham talked about a young lady who had her glasses glasses smashed on the desk and as a older woman was still dealing with nervousness from that moment tell me that things back in life don't have an effect but i'm so glad that there's a great physician who's able to go down and deal with wounds in our life all glory be to god not only can he deal with things in the flesh but he can go down in the spirit where we've been wounded so deep and the great ointment of the holy spirit gives applaud and there comes healing to that wound and then it becomes a scar and a scar is i once was wounded but i've been healed on my womb i'm no longer wounded [Music] i read that i thought about this over and over brother braham tells the same story regarding rahab too rehab was turned out as a young girl natural desire to want to be loved natural desires but satan begin to slip right in and perversion doesn't come right out like that perversion slips in subtly you look at where the church is at right now i'm talking about the church world it did not get that way overnight that's right it came in suddenly innocently right in the end here is this young lady can i have just a few more moments i know i ask you for that a lot but i i don't want to just leave this part hanging i have to stop here but notice what he says god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth not an option but they must and here's what she said the woman said unto him i know look at this you talking about a believer believer brother samuel that woman is a prostitute no no i ain't talking about what you see out here i'm talking about what's down there i know who's the i know that seed down on the inside not yet quicken but it's speaking out i know that messiah's cometh which is called christ and when he is come he will tell us all things and jesus said to her i'm to speak unto thee that's all it took i'm here amen the one that you've been looking for the one to satisfy the thirst i'm he she was always always a believer she was always a daughter of god but she could never be recognized as a believer or a daughter of god and she knew it condemnation was over her life but there was a thirst hallelujah for the living god she had tried to satisfy that thirst with so many things it was a shame it never satisfied amen she went to this let's bring it on down she went to this sport to this sport she took up this activity she took up and nothing wrong nothing wrong with things that you could look at like that that pleasurable that are not sin but it'll never ever satisfy right amen let me just say this to you woman for a man will never satisfy the godly desire that's right and for a woman a man will never satisfy the godly desire on the inside amen but there's one who can satisfy it and that one who's satisfied he'll lead you to the right one like brother brown talked to that one woman and when brother batmaster and she was down there doing certain things and brother brown said sister have you received the holy ghost yet and she said well i'm you know i'm i'm seeking after it but the brahman says you get the holy ghost first and then he will tell you who to marry amen oh friends i love that kind of confidence don't you i got confidence in that there might and there can be things sure within a person's life what about this and what about that but we are not resting ultimately on any of our feelings our thoughts any of our plans it all comes back to the absolute of the holy ghost in a believer's life that's our rock that we rest on sure we might be disappointed sometimes sure we go through tests and trials but we have an anchor a stabilizer that in every situation there's a god who has made himself known to us and we are held even when we feel like we're coming to pieces why because we are in the chosen place eating unleavened bread bread wonderful bread of the word but remember unleavened bread it's not soft bread it's like we need communion it has a roughness to it the word of god that we partake of is wonderful it's precious but with this word comes tests and trials same unleavened bread is also known as the bread of affliction it's the same bread that they were put out of egypt go in the middle of the night before their bread ever rose it was unleavened bread you go to eating on the word of god you find things that's in your life or you find this you remember you go to green with the word go to eating on the word of god i'll tell you what the word of god will do it'll start cleansing desires it'll start cleansing things right out in your life if you'll give yourself to him that's true i'm closing here i don't know where time goes if you all would see how many pages up here that i have up here you'd die probably and i don't ever expect we're going to get to all these pages at all i just brother joe i'm going to try to end right here [Laughter] the mighty god hey friends really what's what's what's what's greater not me not me it's not my message what's greater than the word of god what is it that stabilizes us i understand our bodies my goodness we'll come to a time sometime that we won't ever have to say goodbye we'll never have to lay down and sleep we'll never have to tell somebody you know what i love fellowship but i can go to bed see you if you want a mirror i'll put them here you can talk to the mirror but i got to go i am tired but don't do that to me right now mighty god unveiled before us look at the priest when they seen him express his self exactly with the word and what he was they said it's beelzebub that showed where their nature was it was in the modern thought of the day you catch what brother brahma is saying when he the living word for that day was made known it showed where their nature was you see brother brother brahma is actually unfolding these things what the lord jesus said ye are of your father the devil and he's the father of lies he was actually telling them your birth is a product of a lie without coming into the truth it's a lie but when the little prostitute oh i like this that he met at the gate and told her expressed his messiah sign by telling her what she'd done why she said sir i perceive you're a prophet we know the messiah when he comes he will tell us all these things she was recognizing him as the messiah the anointed one because he met the scriptural qualifications but then says you see those two pieces that were coming together we know that when messiah's coming now god might have had to interbreed this one and that one to get this certain king of the bell like but the motor but when jesus turned and said i'm he that speaks with you there was no such expression as beelzebub she left her water pot you see what happened confession was first thou sent us truly lord and now once he's made himself known to her she just leaves her water pot she leaves all of the burden of sin that she's been carrying leaves it leaves it right and she ran into the city she said come see a man who told me the things that i've done isn't this the very messiah now what did this putting the old scripture with the experience that jesus was giving to her what did it do it made the messiah quickly her sins were forgiven amen because at the beginning now he's telling where her nature is right she was redeemable because she was in god's thinking at the beginning her nature was not in the modern thought of the day her nature that germ that seed that thought that was there she had a thirst she had a thirst she tried to satisfy with a lot of other things but there's only one that can satisfy that first she was redeemable it'd be like this handkerchief if i gave you this handkerchief this is mine is that right if i gave you this these pair of glasses i gave them to you and i said i need to borrow ten dollars you gave me 10 so i can maybe go get a hamburger maybe and then i come back to you later i'll say i need i want my glasses back you said a required price they're your glasses but it's going to require a price and so then the price that's laid is ten dollars you get your glasses you see what had to be it was life that they got away from so it would require life to come back and be offered up by the lord jesus christ and that makes a way so you and i can surrender our life to him and receive that true life redeemable at the beginning he redeemed her brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifested of jehovah what he was and what he is she was seeking for satisfaction a lot of she had a lot of many many thirsts in her life and she was seeking for each one of those satan had perverted a lot but she was unsatisfied now i want you to notice this she knew she knew i know messiah's coming can i just put it this way this young woman though a prostitute she knew about the prophet's message she knew those things and you think she knew those things but she was a prostitute remember the message out here will never do any good right it'll help it'll keep it'll lengthen days i mean it'll keep you from a lot of things keep you from a lot of things it's just heating to it out here but if you ever get it inside of here you ever get it down on the inside of here where it becomes the flame in your heart oh that's different that's different it's not you keeping it it's it keeping you it's god keeping his own word through your life oh sure there will be temptations that comes but the desire seated on the inside is to please him the desire is to serve him he is your life amen he's become now where you could say my thirst is satisfied my hunger is satisfied as david could say master the parents the heart pantheth after the water brooks so my soul pantheth after thee oh god amen david as he would speak of that thirst that was a thirst that was going on in david's soul brother brown tells us david had the word all around him but he wasn't able to live it he knew there was a place if i can just get to that place where i can live it oh my god to think about it that place is right here this morning it ain't just this building it's right here in jesus christ right here in the presence of god that come right up next to your heart and let you know i'm here to lead you i'm here to guide you what do i do yes lord even in our lives where god has brought us into a place of fellowship and union with him he's the only one that can satisfy our lives friends if you try if you try to satisfy you listen to me you might be on you might be alive and here you are you're dwelling there you could say brother samuel i know i love the lord and i i know i love the lord but maybe there's things within your life that you've allowed to accumulate and you've gotten cold there's a place what can i do say what he says say lord jesus all this has been accumulated in my life that's caused me to cool off you don't want to be a cold christian because you weren't made to be a cold christian you were meant to be on fire that'll mean to be walking around like you're an oddball and every time you walk in walmart you're quoting a scripture here and you walk in the target and you i didn't want to talk about it it's you are the scriptures you're living a life that when somebody runs into you you might be in the hardest trial and right here there might be a somberness on your face but there's a joy down in your soul that even though you don't know what's going to take place or how this is going to come out but i know that god is in control i know there's an anchor in my life that i pass from death unto life he is my satisfying portion amen oh glory let's pray father lord you know every need lord that's been gathered here this morning even those lord that on the internet those that would eventually stream this message lord but god my desire lord is the lord jesus knowing that what you've placed on our hearts this morning to speak that you would have a desire the lord i believe with all my heart that there's heart setting right here this morning the lord down within they know i need this thirst satisfied in my life maybe they've been around the message they they know what's true maybe they've lord been in and out of church lord i'm not condemning them for being in and out or living an up and down life i'm only trying to point them to a place this morning that there's a place that they can get to in you where it's no more in and out and up and down it's no more one day i've got victory and one day i don't there's a place in you lord may they lord i pray be that honest in your presence [Music] that as that that woman when you begin to speak to her there was a thirst that she had it didn't matter there wasn't it wasn't men that could satisfy that thirst she was trying to find love but god no doubt as a young lady it was natural she wanted to be loved [Music] she wanted somebody that would love her but lord as she was turned down in the streets i think about it if i could go out on this lord and say it like this she never had a daddy that could take her out one-on-one and show her how a real man would conduct himself on a date with a young lady daddy was maybe too busy daddy had a lot of other things to take place in his life lord may i say this [Music] we are all very busy there's things sometimes lord that i know i can speak on behalf of the congregation here there's times lord we feel like there's just not enough hours in the day we feel like my lord the pressures of work the pressures of life sometimes lord the things lord that even i know in myself if it's lord with me i know the same way with the people sometimes our best intentions of things that we have laid out for the week i'm going to do this and i'm going to do this and get to this and sometimes the schedule that we have laid out we don't even get to those things lord but there's sacrifices there's things that we have to make help us lord would anybody want to be honest before god and say lord i don't want to just make sacrifices but help me to make the right sacrifices because the only sacrifices that you'll receive is the sacrifices that's in the place where you've chose to place your name lord god as much as i want to spend time in the rest of lord my brothers and sisters maybe their children grandchildren so forth but never never should coming to the house of god be an option and say lord i'm spending time with them i'm doing this lord but oh god we realize lord jesus that even though you've commissioned us to do that but it'll never be received and become profitable if i was to do that lord i'm sure my boys they would grow up and they would come to this place going to the house of god is important but if there's something that comes up with family or something else that's more important than going to the house of god lord i and everyone else that's here we realize it's more we're not talking about just church attendance we're talking about really coming lord god and really being on fire really seeing the value not just the lord when we're here but seeing the value in our daily life oh god i'm so thankful how you bring these things down and apply them in such a real real tangible way [Music] maybe if this young woman maybe her daddy would have would have showed her how a young man is to conduct himself he would have showed that love that part that was needed at that time so she would understand to walk in discretion not to give her heart away not to all these things lord might i say likewise we sometimes joke around and say mama's boy but how else is a young man to really know how a young lady ought to conduct themselves without having that time with mama [Music] oh god thank you lord thank you lord help us father help us help us lord i realize lord jesus there's things that as i said right here [Music] we can go back down through lives and say i never had that or i never had this but god you're not here to point out failures this morning no you're here to call us you're here to admonish us those of us that have children those of us that have teenagers those of us that have that even with grandchildren as a grandfather can take that granddaughter out on a date show how a real father how a real man acts glory be to god thank you lord jesus help us lord i pray help us o god lord with the responsibilities that we've been entrusted with lord we need your help father but lord even in these things [Music] if we could have read differently regarding this young lady if she didn't have upon her life the tag ill faint [Music] or what we would know in this term prostitute and she did not even have that tag maybe in this scripture maybe we could read it like this she was the ideal message girl she had long hair she had the dress code down perfectly she knew exactly when to say amen she knew who the messenger was for the age she knew the promises that pertain to that age she could even explain serpent seed and many other doctrines knew of the seals but yet she was still thirsty because knowledge will never quench that thirst knowing truth will never quench that thirst is to know the person of eternal life lord your prophet tells us like this with the pharisees that they had lived such a life you could put no finger finger on their life [Music] but here was a woman that somebody could have put all kinds of fingers but yet down beneath all of that darkness there was a a thirst that man didn't put there [Music] you put that thirst there oh god she had long to be loved she had long to be accepted that i tried lord to be satisfied in many times in many ways but lord god it had never been satisfied until that moment you came lord what she had been longing for that desire let me tell you something young person [Music] middle-aged person older person anyone sitting here streaming or archive this service let me say to you you might have things in your life like here she was she was living with now her sixth man she had things right there that was in her life there were things desires that she had natural desires but the lord jesus came to deal with that desire that was down on the inside if he could only get that desire lined up and beginning to agree with the word of god hallelujah he'll release the transforming power of god and give her strength to lay aside those other things and be united with him [Music] say brother samuel i want that life lord jesus i want that let me tell you what the scripture said blessed are they blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled [Music] what a privilege right now you've been given that desire that desire come from god why don't you quit trying to satisfy it with so many other things well brother samuel i i read my bible every day but are you satisfied [Music] they're saying i come to church every once but are you satisfied have you met the lord jesus the say i know the message but i'm asking you have you met jesus he's the only one that can satisfy you he's the only one that can satisfy this thirst that's what the message come to do is reveal that jehovah of the old is jesus he is our righteousness our peace our provider our banner he's our everything why don't you let him be your everything this morning if you've not made that all sufficient stand brother sam you understand what i've got my life she had a lot of things in her life but don't you want to worship him don't you want to be able to worship him to live a life of worship to where you're free really free [Music]

your hands off of that life [Music] lord jesus may your presence lord god that's right here father not just on this platform lord but through this building right now dear god you're the satisfying portion lord of our lives lord i ask right now god that behind every hand that was lifted up lord god that father you would move lord slipping past o god the outer court the inner and into the most holy place lord god may right here right where they're at lord in their life that god they will allow lord god their heart to become an altar lord god where confession lord god is made lord in your presence to say yes lord that is the truth lord god i have a thirst lord i've tried to satisfy with many other things and i've allowed that all nature or these old desires to rule over my life but i want to be united lord with you father there's a true confession lord now lord i'm asking dear god the lord made the same holy ghost the lord god that has inspired lord god and led lord with this service lord and the word to be spoken i'm asking lord the same one dear god that is dealt with the hearts lord god you're the same god that would lead him to that place lord in a real confession lord that you might move into the innermost chamber of their life oh god ready lord may this be the moment in their life lord whether it's right now at this moment or whether it's the next moment or the next hour but may there be such a resolve in their hearts to say god is my satisfying portion lord they will look to you o god and expect you lord god to meet them granted lord [Music] may you feel them lord not only in this service but i prayed dear god that even as they would walk out of here may they not go to looking for a lord of sensation we're not against sensations but we want to be satisfied we want to be satisfied not just an emotion we believe in emotion but we want to be satisfied lord god may there be such a confidence that's placed in the word of god that what you have said is true and that that promise you've made it real to them lord that the living word desires to give them a living word experience now lord i also want to pray right here as well with the conditions and things of life that comes in you know lord that we are but flesh that's not a compromise but lord god we stand here before you in your presence what perhaps the lord won this morning but say lord

your dear god that right now there'd be a rekindling lord in your presence right here where that decision is made oh glory [Music] the lord they can walk even from this moment not looking back maybe

some of you but i'm gonna just as there would be a question it would rise in your heart i want that thirst quenched if you've never repented and that's what we were doing that's what god was leading you to do right now is an open confession to him to turn and say lord i lay it all down the next part of that that goes with that is to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins that's that's taking care of the past it's you identifying yourself lord i choose to be identified with you i'm going to be identified in your burial your death burial and resurrection you are declaring i choose to be identified with the same god who would come down [Music] and not ashamed to identify himself to speak to my heart if you've not made that stand yet that's part of the pathway that's part of it i encourage you i encourage you i admonish you [Music] to go all the way in the word of god go all the way we don't want to just take that for granted you could see one of the deacons you could see myself let's go all the way [Music] could we just stand how many say lord as we'd stand to our feet if you're able to stand lord i just want to go all the way i want to go all the way every step of the way that god is leading i want to keep on walking with him i want to please him every step of the way every step of the way [Music] oh my glory be to god it's just it is just such a wonderful presence such a wonderful presence [Music] how wonderful how sweet is the presence of the lord glory be to god glory be to god [Music] a woman tried so many physicians yet grew saw to jesus maybe go lower she came start out lower help me help me you know you know we're at a woman tried many positions [Music] [Music] tried to restrain her oh she whispered these words [Music] jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be the same there's only one way to touch [Music] just believe touching jesus that really matters and your life will never be there's only only one way to touch it you know i think about this little woman the situation that she was in the grace of god came to deal with the root of the problem [Music] now i don't know what transpired after that part i i don't know we don't know brother joy lord willing we get there on the other side we'll know her name we'll get a chance we'll get a chance to meet her i don't know what transpired but i have a good i have a good indication that how when the prophet himself remember when brother branham would remember when brother brown was even one at the time and people kept pressing him about marriage and divorce how many remember reading that but they kept asking brother branham questions and questions and from 59 and asking him in 64 and brother brahma said i could give you the answer he said but i don't want to right now never forget many of you know brother hankins went on home to be with the lord brother hankins would tell the story of how it was at those meetings at parkview junior high school i was able to drive around that school there that place was trying to get a visual of it a couple of years ago or a year ago brother hankins said when people came into that meeting brother joe he said they came with suitcases packed husbands and wives brother dave i know you've heard this they came with suitcases packed ready to part ways if that's what would have been said [Music] but the truth remember here's god's grace he said the problem has been of wrong teaching and when you go down and pick it up and all the way down through the message and things that brother brown deals with with marriage and divorce you realize that brother brown even of things that brother brown said back there in 1959 brother bram never changed that at all never changed it never changed what came a greater understanding when you listen to the marriage message marriage and divorce it's more spiritual than it is natural it deals with the reality of how there had to come a death in our life not just a divorce but a death of that old nature in order for there to be that new nature the quickening power of god because god cannot marry anybody who still has a living husband that's invisible union the bride of christ right but god's grace would come down in that service remember the pillar of fire had come down on that on figure rock right out there in arizona right up and down that rock they dismissed the school children and said wow something's taken place up there right brother brown comes down from there and he stands there in marriage and divorce and at the end of that he says but god has given grace he said because you never knew this before but god has given grace and then he goes on to say but make sure you teach your children never to do these things that's a responsibility but what grace that came down friends what grace that come down for you and i we were united with the wrong nature that old nature nobody had to tell us how to how to start lying nobody things were pulled when all of a sudden we came to a certain age the music just started it drew it why that nature was aligned with that but there had to come not just a divorce but there had to come a death amen then when death comes then here comes the quickening power raises up in a new union with that seed on the inside that's the baptism of the holy ghost then you're a new creation what grace is given without the grace of god you or i wouldn't even have a chance i'm so glad for god's grace this might have been some things sometimes the first time that some had heard certain things said but i'm just here to tell you god's grace is sufficient said can i i'm almost i'm going to say this it come to me i said across the table from an individual they're not here they went on home to be with the lord time ago sit across the table at one time per person and they held that book trembling in their hands looked across the table and said i've been wrong i've been wrong i said i never i never seen this here before they were already married but you see that heart that so wanted to be right with god i said i i don't know how i passed this up how did i bypass that how did i get around that but samuel what happened in that moment the grace of god came on the scene god didn't care that we were in a restaurant the grace of god came on the scene the desire to be right with god was permeating through that life you talking about grace that person walked away from that table that's morning they were so thankful for god's grace so thankful because why the desire within their heart was to please him to please him don't you love him hey he put that desire in you he put it in me brother greg he put it in you he's the same god brother vivian that makes that brings that to a reality in our life aren't you glad for that brother drake amen aren't you glad for that [Music] oh my i just love you don't you yes [Music] glory be to god [Music] oh hallelujah glory be to god thank you jesus thank you jesus think about rehab for a moment [Music] when the walls came down and they sent someone in to get rahab they brought her out she didn't even know where she was going she just know she wanted to serve that living god so she asked i want a true token she came out and she began to court one of the generals in the army by the name of salmon think about this brother richie when the time because through samoan and rahab came boaz [Music] when them walls came down and here would have come time for them to stand there at the altar remember the great declaration does anyone have anything to say regarding that would hinder this union all voices of condemnation had been removed there was not a voice that could stand up and say no no she's not worthy he's not worthy every voice had been silenced [Music] there was nobody to speak up because the walls that held her in all the walls she had a desire back there but the walls came down and when the walls came down every accusation came down with the walls so she could stand there and be united with salmon that's our life as a believer let me tell you something this morning you might be walled in with all sorts of things but there's a god here this morning that can take down every wall that's been around your life i don't care how thick the walls are there's a god that can take those walls down and every accusation and everything that will hinder you and keep you back there's a living god here this morning that you can be united with and you'll never be the same again oh hallelujah amen i'm not going to keep you here but if anybody wants prayer i'm here to pray with you god has god his presence is so wonderful oh you're just so wonderful heavenly father as we bow our hearts lord thank you for your mercy in this service lord amen you've arranged this moment this has been a special moment lord in your presence [Music] father may you go with your children as they go their separate ways [Music] fathers were dismissed from the presence of one another but never from your presence may you have your way father i pray in jesus precious name amen amen god bless you as you go oh in your life and your life will never be [Music] the same [Music] just [Music] oh touching jesus is all that really matters [Music] and your life will never be the same thank you lord thank you lord oh and there's only [Music] one way to touch it just believe when you oh i was bound when i knelt oh he's still the same yesterday and then forever [Music] when every wall came down amen praise god i'm free indeed [Music] really matter oh yes it is yes it is lord and your light will never be oh the same [Music] just oh i was bound when but they said they said jesus amen and the amen of god was there to say so and when this prisoner set me free that's all that really matters and your eyes will never be the same and there is only one way to touch it [Applause] and now that i've surrendered my own [Music] lord jesus has come fully in my life my desire is to please him each and every day cause he set me free i'm free at last i'm free indeed [Music] [Music] hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah his name and now i walk as a free man [Music] or daughter of god that's been revealed oh there were seals upon my life that held me back oh but that verse with me i met the living god who broke the seals from my life and satisfied me touching jesus [Music] [Music] for there is only one way to touch in glory just touching jesus one more time touching jesus for there is only [Music] just [Music] [Music]
