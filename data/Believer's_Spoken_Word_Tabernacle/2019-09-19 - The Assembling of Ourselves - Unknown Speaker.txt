[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you believe that tonight hey man he's bigger he's greater amen he's above every situation amen so good to be together in the house of the Lord and so thankful to God for His mercy made a way for us that would be able to be here we just want to look into the word of the Lord here tonight could you want to open your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 10 just want to just continue to speak there we've been looking at the purpose of our gathering but I would like to tonight just deal with the thought the assembling of ourselves together verse 23 is where we like to start let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise let us consider one another I want you to notice how this is placed here and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works I'm not the only one he's coming after he's coming after his body and you're not the only one he's coming after but if you were the only one in this area he'd come for you so because of that let us consider one another to provoke which means to incite or stimulate unto love and to good works amen I can't think of any other way to provoke one another then just be an example I think that's the greatest way we could do it because the gospel is made to be lived in flesh amen not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another so much more so much the more as you see the Day approaching I appreciate the exhortation don't you I appreciate the word that comes forth it may not be these exact words but it comes forth every service keep pressing keep pressing keep pressing keep pressing and we're comforted by those amen let's read that again verse 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching you might have a need you'd like to be remembered tonight let's just pray together hands up all over the building tonight we all stand in need Lord Jesus we Lord aren't just so thankful the Lord that you have given us your name Lord you said and you bid to us ask the Father anything in my name how do it Lord Jesus we're coming to you tonight Lord we believe your God that for every need Lord that is gathered here Lord together tonight that you're present more to minister to that need Lord whether it's for that Lord life that was Lord behind the uplift at hand or whether they're standing in Lord for someone else Lord you know tonight Lord and we just pray Heavenly Father that you were just Lord come among us in a special way tonight every time you come in special it's special and we just ask God that just be another special time tonight Lord as we Lord step away from the cares of life for just a few moments Lord and to hear from you O God Lord Jesus we pray that you'll just come speak through these lips of clay Lord here Oh God father through the ears of clay Oh God may you just take control now Lord in the further part of the service Lord come and speak to our hearts in a personal way we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you as you're being seated I think it's very very fitting in that you know we look here in the scripture and Paul would speak to us that not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together there's some things that God does for us and there's other things he expects us to do and this is one of the things that he expects us to do he manifests himself one of the many he manifests himself to us and his love and his care you know there's things that not one of us can heal our body when we're sick no matter how much medicine we take or whatever that only aids the process but there and we see that there's so many things that God he does for us but yet this is something that God will not do for us God will not assemble for us but he puts this now into into our responsibility that we're not to forsake to assemble ourselves together and if that if this admonition in the word when I look at things in the word when it would speak in express of this it lets me know that there are things that can arise and things that can come about that would seek to pay of our responsibility sometimes in the measure of these things right here is simply as brother Branham lays out throughout the message it's a lack of the love of God we're in that that in within the life they they have not received the love of God down in their soul then there's other times where it becomes the cares of life can actually get in the way and I understand sometimes and you do as well that sometimes there's things to where you are mandated to do certain things and they tell you you're gonna work over and there's no ands ifs or buts about it but then there's other times about it that when we come together and I know there's times that I'll be honest with you just as much as it would be easy for you to come at certain times it's easier sometimes for me to preach than it is at other times there's some times I feel like preaching and other times I don't feel like preaching and you know I know that might sound like a marvel but the only thing that I can do is present myself and let gain knowing that God's going to take control and do what he has purposed to do and so within that I believe that that's where the sacrifice comes into play within our lives because we know that we are not this is not a protracted social gathering but we are assembled and I want you to catch this now we are to assemble according to his assembling of his body this is not like Sunday School where we get stars on the chart for how many times that you come in attendance or whether you know I remember the other church so nothing was a that Gary Avenue that we rented there for a while I remember for a period of time I always looked at that as a boy and I thought it's strange that they had a little placard on the wall where you could slide in numbers and they would always have numbers in attendance how many were in attendance and you know I think it's wonderful for the people of God to come together but we understand that it's not just it's not about numbers well we're not coming here out of numbers we are we are coming here to meet with God so this is not a social gathering we could have that outside at some other place but this is a time that we are to assemble our assembling together is to be an example of the very assembling that God Himself is assembling his body together that he has bought brought his body from all different walks of right life the Bible says when it looks upon it in Revelations 5 that it's out of many Kindred's nations and tongues and when I look at this it must be under the unction of the Holy Spirit that has brought us in to the body of Jesus Christ so I say it like this every time that I go to the house of God I am in the will of God every time I go to the house of God I am in the will of God no question I don't have to pray Lord is it your will for me to go to your house see there are some things that are laid out in the word that even Paul would talk about in 1st Thessalonians 5 then every man ought to know how to possess his vessel on the SATA fication and honor for this is the will of God there are things that times we pray for the will of God and then there are things that the will of God is staring us right in the face and this is one of those things that is the will of God how many knows every time you're in the will of God you don't always fill it [Laughter] jewelry so you know when we look back in this time you know gatherings themselves when you read through the New Testament you'll find many times where they would write and Paul would write about the church in churches in Corinth and then in Ephesus and this you know the the churches of the Gentiles and he would write to different ones salute you and he would write about them that are gathered in the house and he would write about them because they didn't have church buildings like what you and I have done that didn't happen too many hundreds of years later but what they had was public houses and houses that they would come together and they would come out of their houses but they would come together to worship the Lord Jesus Christ they would come together to hear his word and to be exhorted not to think about this when you're running a race there's some times where when you could get a little faint you could get a little discouraged you could get a little doubt cuz after all when God gave you the Holy Ghost he never took away your human body as a matter of fact he never did away with your human spirit you steal five times of being down you steal five times of sickness you Fite plans of discouragement you know sometimes when you get on the mountaintop you think my lord I never coming down from here I'm gonna make sure I do everything so I don't come down from here that's but it is a process within a Christians life think about a song if a song had only high notes how boring that song would be it would be like this apana me you know upon a piano and forgive me because I'm not any pianos but it would be simply if we were playing all low notes now realize there's some people all they talk about is their problems and then you have other people you know that maybe they're only talking on the high end but both of these scales have to go together to make a song and that's why there are high points in a Christian life and no points within a Christian life and that's why when we come to the house of God the Holy Spirit is present to exhort us and point to us that our labor is not in vain that the toils of this road will see nothing when we get to the end of the way it encourages you it it doesn't take away the problem you've got to face tomorrow but it just gives you a little a little charge and encouragement and exhortation of what you to be looking at and I appreciate that of the Lord so as we look at this you know Paul would say in Ephesus one one he would say Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ how many of you realize that when we have come together prayed up they meant lives full of the Spirit of God that we're going to set in heavenly places that is our promise but God will not you know send down the latest drone and coming to the house and and pick us up and then just drop us off he won't do that he wants us to make a declaration verse 4 of Ephesians 2 but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved what you notice what Paul is bringing the focus to we were dead but he quickened us verse 6 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you see what this quickening does the quickening power of God upon the seat of God just not isolated it brings it into the body because this is the purpose it's God assembling himself together Oh glory be to draw that that is why that brother Branham could say many times it's a lack of the love of God why because when that has taken place within the heart it is a longing to be in the house of God not this building so much but it is to come together with believers of like precious faith because it's here we get strength from the Lord and by the help of the Lord we want to look at that a little bit tonight and seeing this purpose that's in here because brother Branham would go on and I've read this quote to you before but there's a part of it here a few weeks ago just stood out to me in and I want to read it again out it's out of the message a position of a believer in Christ he said you're inside of Christ walking and then all the things of the world passes away and all the great Creed's that you had of this thing or that thing is all vanished away and your heart and mind becomes singular on Christ Jesus that's a great paradox in it amen that shows you have died to yourself and born again see there's one of the things it's not just a cleaned-up life but it's where that the heartbeat of that life beats for cries he's the object team man that's the seal of the Holy Ghost then look at this just as sure as church time comes you can't keep from coming to church now we can all be honest on those times when you II could have made more of a little sacrifice than we didn't refill it you know it's kind of like you know brother Joey if you and I were lifting this piano which you wouldn't want me you'd want one these other guys but if you and I were lifting this piano I'll tell you one thing brother Joey after a period of time to be able to look across and say hey brother Samuel you need to lift you need to lift we you need to help me here you need to lift you see it's a part about it that we in ourselves you say well you know I know God don't change this mind toward me no God listen even in the slothfulness you cannot change God's mind can't change God's mind but there's a point within us that it feels the let down why because it's that part of God that he put on the inside of you that longs to be together with God to come together and it's not satisfied streaming we can hear the word and you know will the word itself it's it's edifying its encouragement and we and we need to give heed to the word but but brother and sister you understand that it's not just about well I'll get this off the internet or I'll do this or I'll do that you're you're under estimating here what God has placed within your heart and the value that God sees in it that when you and I come together we need one another mmm say God help me to put that extra effort you know brother Branham says you show me a person he said a man or woman then I'll put God first in everything he said I'll show you a man or woman that'll come out on top no matter what the devil puts on amen a sacrifice you know it's a sacrifice many times that when we come here there's times you don't feel like lifting your head idiot that you don't love God even when it comes to coming to a date that you don't love God but there's a part about it that has to be brought in line because there's a law of V Thresh that's got to be brought subject and sometimes you've got to talk to this guy and say remember you are the house you're not the owner over the sámi you know I'm the only note brother Branham said for himself he said when his throat got the feeling a little bit you know Scratchy he said God tell brother never let him take the service but brother Graham said then something rose up and said no I promised him I would do it oh my you just can't keep from coming to church amen you know those times were we don't put forth the effort and we get that little sting in that correction thank God for it aren't you glad that that they can sting you and he comes we feel that correction within your heart and then it's a blessing Amen it's there on our partner noticed this he says you're just going to go if you have to hobble that's all you're going to church and wants you to look at this statement because the spirit itself bears record of gathering together in Christ Jesus it's not a natural thing it is a spiritual thing the spirit itself bears record of gathering together in Christ Jesus it is according to the Word of God I want you to think of this in Matthew 18:20 the Lord Jesus said for where two or three then in a crowd he ain't looking for a crowd for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them he ain't sitting on the side with dirty feet he's in the midst he's the center of that service he's the theme of every part of that service like a story that you would write or you read a story when you get to the end of that story you know what the theme the main idea the summary what is it that all things were the supporting calf the special was about him the message about him the testimony about him he puts it all together every service he puts it together not me he does all glory be to God it's not numbers that attracts the presence of the Lord it's hearts I want you to listen I know the simple it's hearts that are gathered together in his name believers if I can say it like this we're believers our Jesus says I can take my shoes off I can make myself at home I'm at home now notice this in a very familiar scripture where the Lord Jesus remember he's asked who do men say that I am Simon Peter you know responds thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus responds in this manner says blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and those very simple but Jesus wasn't talking about a church building he wasn't talking about mortar he was talking about his place of dwelling the place of worship where he will meet together and worship with his family under the shed blood that is his church it can be a lot of buildings that got that has his name on it but it's not a building that he's building it's the assembling of his body Oh a bulldozer could come in here some of these crazy people that run through stores and everything else could run in through a wall right here but rather the Church of the Living God the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it there could be a storm of fire whatever more that could wipe this building out but there is no storm there is no fire there is no demon that can upset or overthrow the Church of the Living God [Applause] are you in that church amen than greater is he that is in you glory be to God notice in John 17 verse 20 neither pray I for these alone there is the Lord Jesus in an intercessory prayer but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they may all be one as thou father notice as now it's not left open to interpretation as thou father art in me and I envy that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one let me tell you something O Lord oh my I'm telling you the glory of God is a guarantee to the seed of God this glory I have given them at Pentecost and not even come yet I'm telling you heavens and earth to pass away but not one word can pass away well I feel like preaching right now it wouldn't matter what kind of muck and gumming everything that the devil would try to put over your life and shame you and condemn you but yet God said there's not enough condemnation there's nothing great enough that the blood of Jesus can take ill because before there ever was a devil he was a low him and we were in him hmm take that one devil I and them now and me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me as thou has loved as thou has loved me you've seen it I've seen it people that could be all together in one room and yet they're not one people all together in the same house or whatever and they're not one I'll tell you what for unity and to have oneness it takes a lot of sacrifice takes a lot of patience somebody gonna help me preach it out it takes a lot of overlooking it takes a lot of just what do you think about that what you say too bad we find the key it takes sacrifice for unity now there's no way as much as as much as we would try there's no way in the world that we could get the group of people that's here tonight and get everybody together if it was not for the Lord we're different and that's what God got in mind that but it shows there's a point within us that goes beyond our differences peculiarities and that part is God that's the part of you that's really you so there had to come the release of the true unifying power he's going to build a church by the joy but he wasn't going to build it out of mordor brother Carlos he had the right thing to bring those stones together that had been hewed out in their different ways hallelujah the unifying power of the Holy Ghost acts 2:1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place verse 1 God did not do that for them they had to do that but it was more than just coming in a room that's still one in unity they were in one Accord and that phrase one Accord is throughout the New Testament in places especially in the book of Acts and it means that of notes that are brought together that lend themselves to form a harmony this note might say no I don't play that scale I played this scale right here I don't play that scale I play right here right but this note says no no no no no no no I was meant to be a high note I am a high note in the Symphony of God if that would have been there or would have remained they wouldn't have been in the upper room but those who were in the upper room awaiting on the fulfillment of the promise we're all in one place one mind and one of course what did that their love and expectation for the fulfillment of the promise of the coming of the Holy Ghost and what is it that brings the believers together it is the promise of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that unites us together Oh glory be to God so I don't know about you but hey I just wanna I'm glad to be part of the music sheet I don't care if I'm on the cliff I don't care if I'm on the lines or I'm below the lines as long as I'm on the paper wherever he wants to use me and because of that suddenly there came a sound from heaven know what you think you think that sound from heaven would have come if they weren't in one Accord in one place see sometimes we go to blaming things on God that ain't God's fault God said this is your responsibility it's your responsibility to get in one mind in one Accord vs. I mean you don't know sometimes I come to church I'm in an awful mess that's why we see that's why we've gotten musicians that are anointed with the Holy Ghost and a song leader to sing well let me correct that not sing but lead you but because of this suddenly I love suddenly don't you suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting notice before I went to them it filled the house so they're coming together in one Accord one place at the right appointed time Amen their hearts were knitted together it invited him to come in their midst and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost filled with it and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance he it wasn't just something that was on him and left him when they left it filled them the doubt said this is my place this is my place this is where our by look at this and the message the Godhead explained you see brother Brad says well we couldn't touch him there here we felt him with our hand now what did he do through the offering of that body he becomes Jehovah in us we are parts of him on the day of Pentecost the pillar fire bursted itself up and tongues of fire set upon each one showing that God was separating himself amongst his church then brethren we can only get together and bring that together then we got Jehovah in the fullness when we come together but how can we when this one speaking in tongues and got the baptism and this one and then keeping this lick of fire over here and this one let's put it together Yara put one there puzzles together with somebody you know the one on a table you know how it starts getting down to the end you've been around people that all of a sudden they and magically have a few pieces better laughs no with me don't keep that piece back from the puzzle that piece makes part of the picture and if they don't have that piece what do you look at you don't look at the puzzle and say we did it but there's a part of it that's incomplete you look around and say where is that piece at hey move your feet can I see here you sitting on it hey did you put it in your paper plate and throw it away what happened to it where's that piece you see what happens it moves us in desperation because the picture is not complete without that one little piece so don't keep back your little fire bring it together with the rest of the body oh this is my liquor fact but save grace that gave you the liquor fire gave me the liquify we did not earn it we did not matter we do not have ruled over it we are to surrender I just keep my lick back ain't gonna sing with you cuz you sing too loud every time and he knows I'm picking with it and singing with you seem through loud every time and they can't hear me sing but you say that aleko see here you take the mic and I'll sing with you hello somebody you see it ain't about the song or about air all this out here is about the little fire coming together the liquor fire in me desires to be united with a lick of fire in you this part of you and me it's tickle who this part about you part about me sometimes you say but that's the great mystery so many times we miss what the real love of God is the real love of God is not a feeling it is submission and Dominion by the word of part in our lives us submitting when brother Branham faced that bull and he faced those bees he did say in the name of Jesus I rebuke you know he submitted himself didn't take it out on the bees then take it out on the cow he submitted himself into the hand of God see the lick of fire in me and the liquor firing you you know what it desires to see him glorified one liquor fire gets together with one and another look like you know another look about bit another little pocket pretty soon it's just a Russian woman so it isn't about us it's about him oh god help us to keep that sticky part brought in subjection it's serving one another sometimes I don't feel like preaching certain things that God wants me to preach I just come to me to say it right now there are certain things that are more glorious to preach than other parts but I have to be obedient to the Lord because he knows what we have need of same thing within each of our lives so I'll just say it to you like this don't underestimate the part of Christ in you that it's necessary to the whole body quit holding out the puzzle piece when God on the day of Pentecost come down and the Bible said tongues of fire set up on each other and tongues like fire licks it was that pillar of fire separating itself and dividing itself amongst the people that we would be brethren that day you'll note that I'm in the father the father in me high in you and you in me and well were one we are one not divided not like a family we are a family God didn't want to have a family he is a family he meant what he thought of you and me he thought of himself becoming tangible hallelujah and just like a father and a mother would come together and a stream of life would come forth and from that stream of life there were the two coming together and it would bring forth a family it would bring forth progeny it would bring forth fruit of that union so has the outpouring of the Holy Ghost God's only eye that was sealed in that blood stream now poured out upon the believer it quickens that seed and it assembles us together and you realize this is my family these are my brothers these are my sisters and like any family you go through growing pains all stages toddler teenager can't pass it by nope you got to go through all stages this is why many times even in the church the church sometimes here is in the mid not sometimes but it's carrying children in the womb that have not been born careful not to injure them lest it abort you with me it's careful because the church is a womb a womb that must be brought forth now I don't know about you but you know there could have been some more probably hmm well you know all of our boys were at convenient time so I can't say it but maybe some of you who were born and I don't know me more time I was born but maybe you know a birth is sometimes it don't always come you can't plant it and say hey what this coming Saturday brother Brian you're gonna be born sure the world you're gonna be boring you can't plan that if you try to make that happen you could have end up killing me it is sovereign by God but what brings birth the word the preaching of the word the Holy Ghost coming down brings birth sometimes when the Holy Ghost as it comes like that it's like the IV drip that starts the dilating process but we're just gonna go with this it starts that whole process it's getting it ready man everything starts happening and then before you know it the waters breaking you're like oh my when that water breaks you're like it's time to go for delivery yet delivery hasn't come but yet you're looking at it all deliveries are out here hey mom dad deliveries about here you're calling people talking to them like it's 12:00 noon and it's 2:00 in the morning you're so excited about one that is coming to birth [Applause] what is a lot I could reach on that right now but I'm going to keep on with this I believe the love of God in our hearts if it's represented in the right way it can be the right kind of a drip that'll move on that heart you look at it you might say it's working let's turn it up hey hey hey hey it's not doing what I want to do no but it's dripping just as it ought to be dripping my my we gotta go war this is the fulfillment of prayer of John 17 make them war bring into unity and to oneness into that of a family and you know you recognize the family name when it's expressed to you my brother and I have different first names we got the same last name we're part of the same body that right we are part of the same family amen there's one the great big family of God Universal the body of Jesus Christ but then there are local bodies oh ma you recognize when that family name you see the expression of that family name will not take effect upon everybody but it takes effect upon those who are a part of that family when that name is expressed that life is expressed in unfolds a mystery in their life things begin to start to unfold of who their father is who they are you with me what a time we're living in where people want to know who their daddy is and you know to think about it with the internet and all these things before I don't know what it would have been tailed before for somebody they'd have to find that out but now they're able to get a few little clicks and they're clear across the world it's something within them to what to know mmm I believe that there's a greater going on among the bride of Jesus Christ it's a desire to know him even as I am know amen and when that reveals it reveals the Son of God that glorified the atonement been accepted and full pardoning grace has come to me it's the coming of the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ oh my I think of this in Ephesians 5 where it speaks the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word he loved the church his body he knew you before the foundation of the world and therefore he gave himself to redeem us amen he left the church so he gave himself amen the church was not even in existence at the time when he gave himself but he gave what was necessary to bring into manifestation his church his body just like Adam was put into a deep sleep on Calvary our Savior entered into a deep sleep is that right his side was open and out of his side went water and blood and spirits is that right out of the side of haddem he took his bride and out of the side of Christ he took his bride and he's been assembling his bride together down through the ages to himself it's not a man-made work it's God at work aren't you glad before the foundation of the world he looked beyond all of our mistakes all of our faults all of our shortcomings hold my little attitudes he left me on all of that lord help us he looked beyond that in order to become one with us so the church itself it is the called out body of believers that are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost of which that revelation is Jesus Christ made manifest in and through our lives it is not an idea or a building but a gathering of believers by the Holy Ghost in him in Acts chapter 8 verse 1 i'ma try to get us to a place here in Acts chapter 8 verse 1 and Saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the Apostles and devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him that just stands out to me right now devout men who glory that just jumps off the page right now these were men but enjoyed that after here he was left he was found these were devout men the men said you know what we better stop being Freddie cats because they weren't the first one after to the women were and the men were this ones that said nah what you're sayin ain't right come on now I'm talking Bible see Jesus given position where it belongs you understand me now so now here's some devout men that are standing there now I don't know if they waited till everybody left no doubt they did it might have been nightfall it doesn't matter when it was but they what gonna leave their brother under a rock pile [Applause] this is one they broke bread with this is one they fell a shift with devout men rose up had to pull away the stones Stephen was a man full of the Holy Ghost full of wisdom he was the first deacon in the church they were moving that away or what a loss to the Church of Jerusalem but devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him you think it was sorrow that hid their hearts it was one of them had gone this was one who's good on the front lines if I could just have a little bit of license to preach a little bit this is one who was right in the midst of everything that God was doing he wasn't in the forefront but he was just to be a part of it he was as you would say all-in never had to worry about Stephen Stephen is he on fire for God this man had a testimony he had a testimony even though that may be the rest of them could weep and cry and say what are we going to do or God what Stephen Lord he's he's been such a faithful part of the church he's been one Lord that know now he called me how many other people has he called how many other people has he checked on how many other people has he done this for cuz he was a deacon you know hello somebody he was a deacon and the deacons were to care for the people I better leave that alone tonight they were to care for the people so that the ministry could be given to study and pray somebody say help me Lord did you see if we can really look at it as a body don't just wait for the Deacons don't just wait for somebody else you do your part that lit a fire that's moving in your heart that brings somebody to your attention do something about it amen Carl reach out to them was just literal me well you're under estimating the lick of fire in verse 3 I'm not gonna keep you here I'd love to we've got to work in that school in the morning verse three asks for Saul he made havoc of the church entering him to every house and hailing men and women committed them to prison so the check this was not a building it was the people who made up that gathering the body of believers I wonder how many houses they came to I seen you I seen you hanging around with James no not me yeah you know I've always thought James a little strange little off bless his heart I mean I just those are the kind of no doubt they probably thrust through out of way cuz they were as green as green and yellow as Leola could be when the time of persecution came it shows who's who so I wonder how many dollars they said you got the wrong door I thought I've seen you going down there with that group no not me I I just went along sometimes because you know sometimes they well you know they had fellowship afterwards and kind of like their chicken and rice and things like Adam one of these days you might get caught there's Samuel don't that bother you that somebody would come for chicken and rice no it don't bother me but neither do I go out invite the community either this is not a spaghetti supper in a chicken dinner that's not why we have it we have it to come together and to have a meal with one another and have fellowship and after all I happen believe the gospel is more than just in the four walls of a church if the gospel ain't walking in human flesh then you might want to check what's on the inside of you cuz the liquor v brings the word to life and it makes you it makes us call partners in Redemption brother Samuel I can't believe it you would have fellowship and let somebody come through a fellowship dinner that's not even believer okay let's use your prophets quotes on you brother Branham would hunt both a man called Burt and all his rotten things that he would do he won the only one but Brendan random wasn't with them because they were rotten he was with them because he lacked the hunt the man was a guide and the Prophet was praying for that man's soul I tell you there's not enough soul travail if there was more travail of soul than this of the mouth or my we'd be a lot further down the road Oh help me Lord here's Paul here's Paul's recount his testimony you know Paul he recounts us three times about the road to Damascus and each one of the times two of the three times as he records that he says that that light appeared to him and said on Jesus whom thou persecuted sometimes the audience you're in just merits a few more extra words in verse seven I fell into the ground and heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul why persecutest on me and I answered who art thou Lord and he said unto me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecute us it was necessary in this audience for it to be identified the one you crucified and buried rose again and that saved Jesus is now dwelling in a minute members bodies where they mean that where they meeting where believers get together well what are they doing when they get together they're feasting on the unfailing body Word of the Son of Man well why do they do when they get together all one might sing one might testify want to preach really yeah because you see this is not the orchestration a man this is the assembling of God and His people of God I think of how brother Bram says in mighty God unveiled before us I love their quote he said this convention is a lot different than a lot of other conventions he said we just come together and we just present ourselves not knowing what God's gonna do but he comes among us and does what God does and so we can expect when this look of ours together this look of fires together God's gonna be a month let's just pause there tonight Lord Jesus let me live but surrender heart and life now let me keep back that liquor far from you brother Joey you say brothers say no I don't need you yeah I know you may not need this guy but yet in one way if this guy rubs you you need me you need me you need me because you need me to show what greenness lays in your life just as much as I need you to rub me but that ain't the part that ain't the part about it it's the lick of fire on the inside that gives Dominion to says shut up this ain't this service ain't about you I know you may not like that song but you're here and you're gonna worship they may not be your favorite text but it's mine you gettin burnt but I'll be enraptured let's stand this thing the assembling of ourselves together all the Redeem body of Jesus Christ his church we need one another we need one another every part is so vital let me read you this but the RAM says in the message absolutely we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God we must come together and then the pillar fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it it's kind of like puzzle pieces if there's a hundred puzzle pieces and there's only five pieces on the table you look at and you say it's not complete gotta have all the pieces together we must come together and then the pillar fire is manifested in the wholeness and the fullness of it when his church y'all believe this when his church sets together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in the church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again I want to give how about you I want to give I want to surrender not-not-not oh I gotta give my no no to give my part means for me to die that he might step forth I want to surrender that lick of fire he did he did he did that we might all be together oh I don't want to I don't know about you I believe your heart beats the same way too we don't want we didn't just come here just to be seen we did not just come here just just to come to a building we've come to surrender because you don't know that you're liq a fire anointing with another lick a fire anointing with another liquor fire whether Bram says there's more amongst than and that very chain of faith getting started no telling what can happen we're brother Samuel what about what about my need let us consider one another so you mean the coming together is not about my needs no not primarily it's about him and the rest of your brothers and sisters but the joy I've said this many times for the herb I've said this many times now every time I come to the house of God I believe that what God is going to say God's got something in it for me brother Brian I believe that I don't have to pick and choose I know the Holy Spirit's gonna but sometimes I've prayed it just like this I said Lord I've got needs but I would rather you meet the needs of my brothers and sisters I don't tell you that to make myself anything that's my desire I thank God if we all come together that way lord have mercy what's going to happen [Music] what will happen [Music] let's pray dear Lord Jesus you're the you're the unction Lord in our lives or the power that has come to our lives to put us into service Lord here tonight your children redeemed by your blood Lord I've gathered or the sacrifices but I know that that's not what they're putting before you I see it Lord I see it to me it encourages me it encourages me Lord God I thank you for that Lord there's hearts that love you so much Lord that they would sacrifice and go beyond the easy and they would make the effort but there's something greater Lord there because they just didn't come we've not just come to church just to come to a building the assembling of ourselves together you did not do it for us but you call us together and you admonish us don't forsake to do it don't neglect don't count it a light thing don't don't make it an optional thing the lick of fire in your heart it's necessary to come together with the other licks of fire to make more of that pillar of fire in our midst truly Lord it's not about numbers as we can see for whether two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in their midst the Lord when that liquor fire the love of God the Holy Ghost is burning in the bosom of her heart we'd all to get together with others of like precious faith going not just to a home but to the house of God to fellowship around the Word of God to receive instruction correction perfecting in our lives by the Holy Ghost lord help us forgive us lord when we've been slothful forgive us lord when we didn't put forth that extra effort and we just kind of gave in and just kind of reasoned why that it may not be so important forgive us for that Lord and help us Lord God to realize that this coming together it's not about us it's about my brothers and sisters or God if there's one that's not in the fold tonight would you just Lord God just whisper to their heart and let them know [Music] your desire is to bring them in not by name on a book not by just coming to a building but your desire to baptize them into the body by that same spirit or jesus may be that harder hearts maybe they're streaming maybe they're standing right here tonight but from their heart they can just say Lord that's my desire that's what I want would grant it Lord tonight make us more of a servant help
