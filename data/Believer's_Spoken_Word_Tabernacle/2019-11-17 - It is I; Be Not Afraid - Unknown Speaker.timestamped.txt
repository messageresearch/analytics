[37:38] blessing
[37:39] to me and you're each just your real
[37:41] special people and I've been different
[37:43] places throughout the world not trying
[37:45] to sound well-traveled because I'm not
[37:47] some guru or something but it's just
[37:50] always a real pleasure real godly spirit
[37:52] here and we just love you thank you for
[37:54] the opportunity to be here with you
[37:56] again this morning
[37:57] appreciate your pastor as well who's out
[37:59] and about and pray the Lord watch over
[38:00] him as he's traveling and there's a if
[38:03] you have your Bibles here Matthew
[38:04] chapter 14 I'll try not to wax poetic
[38:07] but we'll get straight into the
[38:08] scripture here and we're gonna look in
[38:10] the 22nd verse this morning Matthew
[38:14] chapter 14 verse 22 and the scripture
[38:18] says this is straightway Jesus
[38:19] constrained his disciples to get into a
[38:23] ship and to go before him unto the other
[38:25] side while he sent the multitudes away
[38:28] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[38:30] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[38:33] and when the evening was come he was
[38:35] there alone but the ship was now in the
[38:37] midst of the sea tossed with waves for
[38:40] the wind was contrary and then the
[38:42] fourth watch of the night Jesus went
[38:43] unto them walking on the sea and when
[38:46] the disciples saw him walking on the sea
[38:49] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[38:51] and they cried out for fear but
[38:53] straightway Jesus spake unto them saying
[38:55] be of good cheer it is I be not afraid
[38:59] verse 28 and Peter answered him and said
[39:02] lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[39:06] on the water I like that got a little
[39:09] backbone there said hey that's Jesus
[39:11] let's do something about it if he's here
[39:14] hey man we're gonna drown anyway but if
[39:16] he's here I might as well walk on the
[39:18] water I like that and he said come and
[39:22] when Peter was come out come down out of
[39:25] the ship he walked on the water to go to
[39:28] Jesus praise the Lord verse 27 I want to
[39:30] read this once more but straightway
[39:32] Jesus spake unto them saying be of good
[39:34] cheer it is I be not afraid and I like
[39:37] to take that as a thought this morning
[39:38] it as I be not afraid and believing that
[39:41] he is here with us just as well why
[39:43] don't we just bow our heads for a word
[39:44] of Prayer this morning our gracious
[39:46] father we are so thankful today Lord to
[39:49] be able to read your word Lord what
[39:51] lesson is to just live in a country
[39:53] where we are able to have a Bible and to
[39:56] read it and to be literate and Lord just
[39:59] having travel different places I know
[40:01] what that means it's just a real
[40:02] blessing to even be able to to read the
[40:04] scripture known that the the Catholic
[40:06] Church throughout history has tried to
[40:08] stop the people and even put it in the
[40:10] language they couldn't read it
[40:11] and so Lord it's just such a great thing
[40:13] to even be able to read the pages of
[40:15] this Bible this morning but what a
[40:16] greater thing it is to us Lord to be
[40:19] aware that the very author of this word
[40:21] the scripture the same one is here with
[40:23] us present lor we're not reading about a
[40:26] historical God but you were the present
[40:28] help in the time of trouble you are the
[40:30] great I am NOT I was not I will be but
[40:34] you are right now here with us in your
[40:36] present Lord I don't believe that this
[40:38] words of this prayers our hearts have
[40:40] joined together then they would fall to
[40:42] the ground but Lord that you would hear
[40:44] our cries and attending to our prayer
[40:46] Lord Father for me this morning I for my
[40:49] own sake Lord as I was saying to the
[40:51] people I I just even the sickness in my
[40:53] body and the weariness Lord I'm a
[40:55] witness in times past it's you were able
[40:57] to to move that completely silence it
[40:59] doesn't have to be a hindrance to the
[41:01] service and Lord whatever condition
[41:03] whatever situation whatever difficulty
[41:05] that we have entered into this place
[41:07] with his a body of believers this
[41:09] morning I believe that you could just
[41:10] take all doubt and dissolve it Lord you
[41:13] could take all sickness and make it well
[41:15] father you could take darkness and give
[41:17] us a light for darkness look if there be
[41:20] a spirit of heaviness I pray you give us
[41:22] a garment of praise for the spirit of
[41:24] heaviness can you break every chain and
[41:27] every yoke all oppression all darkness
[41:29] Lord you did not ordained for us to be a
[41:32] people bound by the things of this world
[41:34] but she'd given us a great Liberty to
[41:36] stand fast and low we take our positions
[41:39] this morning as believers we lift our
[41:41] voice and we confess our great power and
[41:44] Liberty in Jesus Christ then we are free
[41:47] to worship you we are free to magnifier
[41:50] we are free to live out his sons and
[41:52] daughters of God Lord I pray you just
[41:55] come in a mighty way speak to the people
[41:58] Lord may you magnify and get great glory
[42:00] unto your name and unto yourself in this
[42:03] place father for I believe you have
[42:05] ordained us to worship you in spirit and
[42:09] in truth father have your way we pray we
[42:11] commit all these things our lives our
[42:14] hearts our souls into your faithful
[42:17] hands as a loving and a faithful creator
[42:19] and we ask all these things when you
[42:22] bless the word now in the name of Jesus
[42:24] Christ amen
[42:25] and I mean god bless these are seated it
[42:28] is I be not afraid brother branham
[42:30] preaches a sermon attest to me on the
[42:32] sea preaches the same thought be not
[42:34] afraid
[42:34] different titles I think at least that I
[42:37] could count at least 16 different times
[42:39] maybe more in the message and so I just
[42:41] take a quote from one of these this
[42:42] morning brother ran when he preaches
[42:44] about this usually takes a great length
[42:46] to talk about the testimonies that they
[42:48] were sharing and we are familiar with
[42:49] many of these testimonies but I thought
[42:51] well they seen somebody come walking on
[42:54] the water walking up amen he ever been
[42:56] in that place before it looks like all
[42:57] hope was gone amen
[42:59] listen you can feel that way there they
[43:01] were in darkness in despair and they
[43:02] thought their lives were forfeit but
[43:04] they seen somebody walking up and
[43:06] brother Adam says something quite
[43:07] remarkable here this isn't the thing the
[43:09] sad part he says listen close the only
[43:12] thing that could help them they was
[43:14] afraid of it they said look spirit II it
[43:17] might be you know a spirit if that
[43:19] hasn't happened again they're afraid of
[43:22] it they're afraid of fortune telling
[43:24] they're afraid of some kind of a devil
[43:26] power when Jesus said it would happen in
[43:28] this day amen I want you understand this
[43:31] message and what God has done this age
[43:33] it wasn't some sort of a plan B for God
[43:36] this wasn't something that God just kind
[43:38] of threw it at the end you know like
[43:40] when you go buy a car they will throw in
[43:41] an air freshener with it or something
[43:43] like that this isn't something I just
[43:44] kind of threw in there but this is that
[43:46] was prophesied by the Prophet Malachi
[43:49] this is that which was spoken of Luke
[43:51] 1730 revelations 10 7 this was foretold
[43:54] by the men of old but they were moogly
[43:57] Speight
[43:57] the Holy Ghost this was supposed to
[43:59] happen the way happen and yet the people
[44:03] don't recognize and they're afraid of
[44:05] the very thing God told would come to
[44:08] pass amen
[44:10] the Prophet says this they're afraid is
[44:12] some kind of a devil power jesus said it
[44:15] would happen in this day the only thing
[44:18] that can help them is Jesus Christ not
[44:21] another denomination not all of them
[44:24] joining together that's just going to
[44:26] make it worse than ever the only thing
[44:28] that can help you is Jesus Christ when
[44:31] they promised to return the last days in
[44:32] this form to do this promising just like
[44:37] before the promised son returned to
[44:38] Abraham the first seed the royal seed of
[44:40] Abraham Jesus he said you would see the
[44:43] same thing amen get this off here now
[44:47] before the promised son God will
[44:49] manifest himself in flesh and do exactly
[44:52] like Jesus did like he said he would do
[44:55] just like would be done the last days
[44:57] and here all those promises we could
[44:59] just lay them out by dozens right here
[45:02] before you that is supposed to take
[45:05] place amen I want you just think about
[45:08] even for yourself the promises you like
[45:09] God promised that he would provide for
[45:11] you God promised to be a healer for you
[45:13] he promised all these things I don't
[45:15] want you to think that's strange
[45:16] we get to a place sometimes believers
[45:19] God does something like wow I can't live
[45:21] God did that and I'm thinking you're the
[45:23] believer you're supposed to believe that
[45:26] but why do we make it like these things
[45:29] were done in the corner we've got tape
[45:30] after tape of God doing something
[45:33] supernatural names and places and times
[45:36] and miracles things a man can't do
[45:38] things you can't do and we sit there
[45:40] like we're shocked
[45:42] he said it was supposed to take place we
[45:45] shouldn't you know it's against the the
[45:47] people they marvel is somebody coming in
[45:49] one time here a while back and I was
[45:51] preaching about something I mentioned
[45:52] certain testimony said brother I just
[45:53] marvel that that took place and I said
[45:55] I'm marvel that's you marvel and then
[45:58] it's not me say we're supposed to
[46:01] believe these things it's supposed to be
[46:03] in our life every day I'm not saying
[46:07] that as a rebuke I'm not coming down
[46:09] when I'm saying we can believe for more
[46:11] we can believe for something greater
[46:13] because it was foretold for this day
[46:15] that's people amen not just his prophet
[46:19] his people would do exploits who's he
[46:22] talking about his talk by you when you
[46:25] recognize him not you're the one you're
[46:28] the one that's called to it amen
[46:30] well you should feel good about her I
[46:32] feel good about it I'm happy amen
[46:34] it's like predestination some people
[46:36] don't like predestination I like
[46:37] predestination cuz I'm predestinated I'm
[46:40] okay with it if you're not I understand
[46:43] why you get upset but look I'm the
[46:44] predestinated and then well I feel good
[46:48] about any man where's the Lord he says
[46:51] this he says the churches which ought to
[46:54] be with arms out to receive it well I'm
[46:56] a little afraid of that it doesn't
[46:58] belong to our group see and they're a
[47:01] scared of it that's the Kentucky English
[47:03] they're for you they're a scared of it
[47:05] the only thing that can bring them to
[47:07] Christ is Christ himself and unless I
[47:11] can't do it free you can't never he can
[47:13] do it he's the only one and they're
[47:16] afraid of that it's scary oh I don't
[47:18] know that might be spirited you seen I
[47:21] don't know about the scared of the only
[47:23] thing that can help them and watch what
[47:26] he says but in that
[47:27] our that lifted Church that group
[47:30] sitting out there scared the elected
[47:33] were scared of it
[47:34] scared that a lobby sweet they didn't
[47:36] want to have nothing to go ahead listen
[47:39] they weren't looking for him to come he
[47:41] come to them they didn't want nothing to
[47:44] do with it then come that sweet voice be
[47:47] not afraid in his eyes again brother Ram
[47:51] says in 1963 says Jesus come walking to
[47:54] them on the water they got scared said
[47:55] it's spooky we'd better not know that
[47:57] meeting anymore it's funny they seen him
[48:00] return again in his power just as he
[48:03] promised through the pages of these
[48:04] Bible of these pages of this Bible
[48:06] rather that he would do this in the last
[48:08] days and that walked in a minute that
[48:10] people say oh that's just mental
[48:11] telepathy
[48:12] that's spiritualism that's some kind of
[48:14] a see that's the same thing and the only
[48:18] thing that will save I'll just sort of
[48:19] really lay this in this one because
[48:20] sometimes I think we we think a program
[48:22] or an idea or our own all I listen to
[48:26] tapes I do that that's all good that's
[48:27] fine but that don't save you listen I
[48:29] know a guy and he lists the tapes every
[48:31] day and he's in jail for four I don't
[48:34] want to tell you what he's in jail for
[48:35] amen
[48:35] listen there's got to be a connection
[48:37] somewhere with the one that's speaking
[48:40] and many times as I was preaching about
[48:43] just last and many times we try to
[48:44] substitute it with our own idea or all
[48:46] works well I did this and I didn't do
[48:48] this and I stopped this
[48:49] that's good that's fine but there's got
[48:51] to be something great and behind it it's
[48:54] gotta be who's doing it who's saying it
[48:57] who's speaking it's not you listen if I
[49:00] come to you on the water first why would
[49:01] i'd be paddling this hey man I'm not
[49:04] even a great swimmer I mean you'd be
[49:05] like what sit down hey man listen the
[49:08] reason to not be afraid is not because
[49:09] of me or a deacon or a passion it's
[49:12] because it's Jesus Christ that's the
[49:15] reason amen
[49:16] here's a little listen you've got you
[49:18] might have listen Oh hallelujah well
[49:21] praise the Lord I got four kids some of
[49:24] y'all got kids some of you may be
[49:26] getting ready to have kids over and I go
[49:27] too far with that
[49:28] Amen you know how does your lady to see
[49:31] him people say you know what I don't
[49:32] even know why somebody want to raise
[49:33] kids in this day and age it's so dark
[49:35] it's oh my god people say that to me why
[49:37] you having all them kids
[49:39] oh I love it the people that have more
[49:41] kids than me tell me why do you have
[49:42] four kids it's easily people with like
[49:44] six or seven well you got so many kids
[49:46] don't you know how bad it is
[49:48] I understand how bad it is I'm not
[49:50] allowed into it I can look at a
[49:51] newspaper I can look out the window but
[49:54] I am also convinced that we have
[49:56] received the greatest message that's
[49:58] ever struck the face of the earth and
[50:00] where sin abounds grace knows much more
[50:03] about
[50:03] I believe the guns preacher token
[50:06] message to us to the mouth of a prophet
[50:08] for this day it wasn't for another
[50:10] region with the token is for the end
[50:12] time there's a reason for it so you can
[50:15] take your children take your family and
[50:17] not have to live in fear well you can
[50:20] say I believe others are keeping power
[50:21] and the literal lack of Jesus Christ for
[50:24] me for my wife for my family for my
[50:28] loved ones you can look at a thousand
[50:32] circumstances and be afraid but you've
[50:33] got one good reason this morning not to
[50:35] be afraid he's here
[50:39] and that one reason is greater than the
[50:41] thousand reasons to be afraid you can
[50:43] look at sickness you can look at on
[50:45] paint mills if you look at church issues
[50:47] if you look at all kinds of confusion
[50:49] and you can look the devil straight in
[50:51] the eye and say I don't have to be
[50:52] afraid because he is here Jesus is here
[50:59] in gravy's he wears the Aggies lapis in
[51:02] the mornings a new boat song to me
[51:09] that's what I'm just a good saying he's
[51:12] here made the difference he's done
[51:18] things in my life I could not do I know
[51:22] it wasn't me I couldn't I couldn't
[51:25] overcome addiction I couldn't overcome a
[51:26] temper like a bust I couldn't overcome
[51:28] these things it was Jesus Jesus on the
[51:33] inside looking toward the outside well
[51:38] Holly and I appreciate that by the way
[51:41] hey there all of them were scared they
[51:45] meant all of us caring the credit what
[51:47] is this we don't know it looks scary
[51:49] look spooky what happened right in that
[51:52] crucial moment there come a voice fear
[51:55] not it is I be not afraid
[52:00] Amen now I want you to understand
[52:03] they're not afraid of the idea of Jesus
[52:07] actually they were talking about the
[52:09] head multiplied the loaves they've seen
[52:12] the sick healed they seen the dead
[52:14] raised by eyes on the idea of a
[52:16] historical Jesus did not frighten them
[52:17] now they have a historical Jesus doesn't
[52:20] frighten most people and then because
[52:22] you can make a historical Jesus whatever
[52:23] you want you got your progressive
[52:24] liberal hippie Jesus you got your
[52:26] staunch conservative Jesus and he always
[52:28] votes Republican and you've got your
[52:30] your Jesus set that wants you to not pay
[52:32] taxes and your yeah people can invent a
[52:35] Jesus for what out you don't saying look
[52:37] we're going to Christmas and they've got
[52:39] Jesus in a manger as a little baby well
[52:42] that's not where he's at today
[52:44] and then that was where he was it's not
[52:46] where he is but he's in this Ranger he's
[52:49] in this dwelling place today and that's
[52:51] not where he's not he's not on the cross
[52:53] anymore like in the good old Catholic
[52:55] Church they got him hanging on the lawn
[52:56] across he don't need the cross today
[52:58] he's done with the cross the cross is
[53:00] finished the cross is for you and I he
[53:03] suited the right-handed lorry far about
[53:06] all principality and all power and all
[53:09] might know Dominion amen
[53:14] they loved the idea of a of a historical
[53:18] Jesus and we can we can we can puppet
[53:20] him and say what we want
[53:21] nobody's afraid of that kinda Jesus but
[53:24] when he comes in a different form and
[53:26] listen he's not doing something
[53:28] different he's doing exactly what he's
[53:31] always done he's speaking exactly what
[53:33] he's always spoken nothing has changed
[53:35] except the form of him but because it
[53:37] doesn't line up with our idea because
[53:39] they can't control that kind of Jesus we
[53:43] can't make that Jesus say what we want
[53:45] we can't make an excuse whatever kind of
[53:47] thing we've got in our life that we want
[53:48] to get away with and then they're afraid
[53:51] of it
[53:51] and yeah that's the only listen to the
[53:54] church kids listen the church can't save
[53:55] you and then I would love to say I can
[53:58] save you but I can't do it amen but I
[54:00] believe the one who can he's here the
[54:02] same one that saved you
[54:04] the same one that filled with the Holy
[54:05] Ghost he's the same one here today then
[54:07] be whatever your need is here comes
[54:14] Jesus the same God the same part of the
[54:16] same life here by his Spirit it offends
[54:19] people that's that's the big world I'm a
[54:21] friend and I'm like why do I care
[54:23] well I'm offended and this offends me
[54:26] and this person over here is offended by
[54:28] my bye-bye Jesus and I'm thinking whoa
[54:30] unto them that are that offend one of
[54:32] his little one's amen
[54:33] well worried about offending the wrong
[54:34] people we get so even as believers well
[54:37] I don't want to offend my coworker and I
[54:38] don't want to offend this person I don't
[54:40] want to offend Jesus that's the one I
[54:43] want to make sure I don't offend him I'm
[54:44] not talking about getting everybody's
[54:45] face and trying to tear them down that's
[54:47] not what I'm getting
[54:47] please don't misinterpret that I'm
[54:50] saying she go punch somebody in the face
[54:51] because they don't believe what you
[54:52] believe
[54:52] I know some people like that that ain't
[54:54] no better amen
[54:55] but what I'm saying is who we've got to
[54:58] be mindful is the one that's on the
[54:59] water because he's the one that's gonna
[55:01] save you when your boats getting tossed
[55:03] to and fro by the storms of life we're
[55:05] all hell's moving through your life and
[55:07] sickness strikes and darkness comes and
[55:09] you can't find a way out and you as a
[55:10] believer an elected believer find that
[55:13] you're losing hope don't get quiet on me
[55:16] listen
[55:17] some of y'all always got the victory I
[55:19] love preach these sermons and some
[55:20] people like I've always praise God I
[55:23] wish that was you but I ain't always got
[55:27] a bit well I do I just don't think I do
[55:29] hey man we've all got victory that's our
[55:31] victories all right thanks but sometimes
[55:34] they don't seem like we got the victory
[55:35] I mean you discouraged don't act like
[55:37] get all a bunch of robots here we never
[55:39] have discouragement this night I get
[55:41] discouraged and that's not ten years ago
[55:45] that's probably before I come out here
[55:46] so you start singing I'd be discouraged
[55:50] I look at things
[55:52] I leave the circumstances and then we
[55:54] all do listen what we're taught to do
[55:56] that I'm gonna help myself here a little
[55:58] bit we're taught to do that firmly only
[56:00] time of life hey man we look at these
[56:04] things were saying well I can't can it
[56:05] be amen
[56:06] but I'm so thankful because Jesus when
[56:09] he come in this there he comes just like
[56:10] he did that in a man when God comes when
[56:13] Jesus comes praise God he's not silent
[56:16] he not have been one thing they saw him
[56:18] coming I said what's that he didn't say
[56:20] nothing but he speaks when he comes and
[56:23] when there's a voice of God in this age
[56:25] and spoken to us many people look at a
[56:27] prophets ministry they look at the
[56:29] message they question is this a man's
[56:31] idea is it a cult is it some sort of a
[56:33] fanaticism but we've heard a voice
[56:36] it was the same watch let's pump in the
[56:38] middle that see that night it was Jesus
[56:41] Christ and don't be afraid it's I
[56:44] this message is more than trip doctrine
[56:47] it's more than just entertainment it's
[56:49] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[56:52] well and when you recognize who it is
[56:55] let us come to you you have no reason to
[56:58] be afraid they can calm every storm he
[57:01] can dissolve every that he can overcome
[57:03] every adversary there's nothing greater
[57:06] oh my thank God hey man this left your
[57:14] own devices we wouldn't know hey man we
[57:17] think we've got it all figured out
[57:18] you don't know nothing except what he's
[57:20] done told you and then what isn't what
[57:23] you know about God is what he's declared
[57:25] in his word he didn't have to do that
[57:27] but he chose to do that he revealed him
[57:29] somewhere in simplicity why cuz he wants
[57:33] you to get it hope you catch that now
[57:36] he's not trying to hide it from you
[57:38] here's a believer he's trying to come
[57:40] here he wants you to know he know what
[57:43] you look at him on the stand so I don't
[57:44] know what this is and it's a bunch of
[57:46] finale when is it now he's spoken to you
[57:48] cuz he doesn't want you to be afraid he
[57:57] give him one reason out of a thousand
[58:00] reasons to be afraid to give me one
[58:01] reason not to me and that one reason is
[58:03] it greater than every reason to
[58:04] disbelieve it's greater than every
[58:06] reason to be fearful it's everything
[58:07] it's greater than every reason to want
[58:09] to turn back and say what should we do
[58:10] and and all these other things amen he
[58:14] comes and he comes and he's not silent
[58:17] amen but he speaks to take fear away
[58:20] from you a man and that's why I'm
[58:21] concerned I preached this out of this
[58:23] thought and this is this is why I feel
[58:25] so strongly about this my concern is a
[58:27] minister and as a dad as I get older as
[58:29] our young people they're taught to be
[58:31] afraid of the moving of the Holy Ghost
[58:34] say men are old people they're taught to
[58:36] be afraid of the moving of the Holy
[58:38] Ghost we've seen these things they're on
[58:40] tape you can listen to it and yet you
[58:42] get around some people and they're just
[58:43] so afraid well I'm afraid that God might
[58:46] might give some people a little excited
[58:47] we don't want to say Amen - uh-huh we go
[58:50] on the stage Allah I say praise God
[58:53] I like it listen I don't know whether
[58:56] you realize this or not this is the
[58:57] quietest place you're ever gonna live
[59:01] this you don't like it loud here you're
[59:03] not gonna like it up there well
[59:08] hallelujah praise the Lord people that
[59:14] are being taught to be afraid I want to
[59:15] read this quote from the questions and
[59:17] answers I want you to think about this
[59:19] and it's really meditating on a moment
[59:21] what the prophets saying here he says oh
[59:23] if that great holy church maybe you're
[59:25] familiar with this this is if that great
[59:26] holy church only realized its power to
[59:30] do these things and I not talking about
[59:32] something out there it's all about
[59:34] something here you know we say these
[59:37] things like speaking of world in
[59:38] existence and missing limbs being
[59:40] restored he's not talking about
[59:41] something out there on the other side of
[59:43] the Sea of Galilee you come out where
[59:45] you're at in your storm of life right
[59:46] here today well you're both being tossed
[59:49] that's where he's at
[59:50] if you only realize the power in the
[59:53] church to do these things but there's so
[59:57] much doubt and fear and trembling
[59:59] wondering if it will could it happen as
[1:00:03] long as that exists the church can never
[1:00:06] stand upright amen
[1:00:09] he says this when every talk of fear is
[1:00:12] vanished hey man now this isn't quite a
[1:00:16] thing because we talk about fear or
[1:00:18] every talk of fear vanishing we we do it
[1:00:21] subconsciously so often amen we're like
[1:00:24] I said we were trained almost to talk in
[1:00:26] a way of fearfulness from an early age
[1:00:28] and what I want you to understand is
[1:00:29] when every talk of that disappears
[1:00:32] amen because out of the abundance of the
[1:00:33] heart the mouth speaks when fear is gone
[1:00:35] he says this whenever talk of fears
[1:00:38] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[1:00:40] completely in control of the church then
[1:00:43] all fears are gone and the church has
[1:00:46] power so notice if you are lying fear to
[1:00:50] have preeminence or make decisions for
[1:00:52] you then you're not letting the Holy
[1:00:53] Spirit do it because God has not given
[1:00:56] us the spirit of fear but of power of
[1:00:58] Dunamis ability of power love and a
[1:01:01] sound mind amen
[1:01:02] so it's either one or the
[1:01:04] oh praise the Lord he's a see why they
[1:01:08] have everything that heaven owns behind
[1:01:11] them who's that you can raise your hand
[1:01:14] this is participation now you get points
[1:01:16] with their have everything that heaven
[1:01:20] heaven has behind them that's you why is
[1:01:24] there ambassadors of the throne
[1:01:26] absolutely an ambassador Christ has the
[1:01:30] authority and everything that Christ
[1:01:32] owns belongs to that ambassador and he
[1:01:35] said go you into all the world ye are my
[1:01:38] witnesses after that the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:41] come on you what is a witness he says
[1:01:44] it's an ambassador to come and to
[1:01:46] witness something the whole powers of
[1:01:49] heaven is right in your hands let me ask
[1:01:52] the question why do we set and the
[1:01:54] church is burned and we sit Dorna it's
[1:01:56] because we don't recognize these things
[1:01:59] amen I want you to saying we're called
[1:02:02] to be a witness of it amen now I'm not
[1:02:04] gonna get into the recent events of the
[1:02:06] week in the politics and things but you
[1:02:08] get these guys on the stand and they say
[1:02:10] well I heard a guy say that he heard a
[1:02:11] guy say this guy did that's not a
[1:02:13] witness that's hearsay amen and my
[1:02:17] concern is a lot of people in church and
[1:02:19] a lot of preachers they preach here say
[1:02:21] what about what God has done I heard
[1:02:24] about the Holy Ghost I've heard about
[1:02:26] these things somebody told me one time
[1:02:27] about a certain guy that just shook the
[1:02:29] guy's hand that knew brother Branham but
[1:02:32] do you know Jesus have you met the same
[1:02:34] one listen you can't get one by painted
[1:02:36] fire have you met the same raucous man
[1:02:42] now you're a witness you've seen it
[1:02:45] firsthand
[1:02:46] you're a witness of it amen well I
[1:02:49] didn't put this on my notes but I was
[1:02:50] talked about this years ago I said
[1:02:51] you're in the witness protection program
[1:02:53] God's got a witness protection program
[1:02:56] hey man we've been really putting this
[1:02:59] witness protection program they change
[1:03:01] your name they change your identity they
[1:03:03] change where you live and then all the
[1:03:06] protector testimonies eliteness listen
[1:03:08] God change who you are he changed your
[1:03:10] name they caught the bride he's chained
[1:03:12] where you live they're not the same
[1:03:14] person you speak your identity has been
[1:03:16] changed you're a witness like I said we
[1:03:25] learn in our lives to make decisions
[1:03:27] based on fear we teach art shop of it
[1:03:29] there's a natural side of that a man I
[1:03:31] don't encourage my children to play in
[1:03:33] the street with the ball by face and I'm
[1:03:38] not saying to be funny but some people
[1:03:40] go the other way with it amen I'm not
[1:03:41] encouraging recklessness for the sake of
[1:03:43] being reckless hey man listen there it
[1:03:46] makes sense a man there's a natural side
[1:03:48] of things you teach your children not to
[1:03:49] play with fire don't don't play in
[1:03:50] traffic amen we teach them from an early
[1:03:53] age to be afraid of the consequences
[1:03:56] thing but the problem is is we get older
[1:03:57] we we experience disappointment so we go
[1:04:00] through difficulties and we it kind of
[1:04:02] rejection and we we learn fear hey man
[1:04:05] we learn the fear of death and the fear
[1:04:07] of pain the fear of loneliness the fear
[1:04:09] of rejection we avoid danger we observe
[1:04:11] the law and alley
[1:04:12] now we go to church and we put on an act
[1:04:14] in front of everybody because we fear
[1:04:17] the consequences of being ostracized
[1:04:20] amen and some people that's how they
[1:04:22] live their life and I want you
[1:04:23] understand if that's all the farther
[1:04:25] you've come you're living in fear you're
[1:04:28] missing what the kingdoms about many
[1:04:31] Christians live in fear those other
[1:04:33] Christians are not I'm not D
[1:04:34] Christianizing people even many
[1:04:35] Christians they live daily with fear
[1:04:37] they make decisions based on fear they
[1:04:40] operate in fear and you're missing what
[1:04:41] the kingdom is really about because
[1:04:43] that's not what the kingdoms about if
[1:04:44] the kingdom is here Jesus is here you
[1:04:47] don't have to be afraid
[1:04:49] hey man well praise the Lord Paul Paul
[1:04:53] quotes a Greek poet so I'm gonna quote
[1:04:55] Shakespeare here son intelligent I'm not
[1:05:00] but years ago I was in school we read
[1:05:02] Julius Caesar had to read was required
[1:05:04] reading but I was reading Julius Caesar
[1:05:06] and I do actually like to play Julius
[1:05:08] Caesar I
[1:05:09] and Julius Caesar when he finds out he's
[1:05:10] gonna be killed on the Ides of March he
[1:05:12] said something remarkable it's always
[1:05:13] stuck with me my life throughout my life
[1:05:15] and maybe you're familiar of this but
[1:05:17] Caesar says this he says cowards die
[1:05:19] many times before their deaths but a
[1:05:22] hero only tastes of death but once and
[1:05:25] then and I think that's a I was a
[1:05:27] remarkable it's a powerful statement to
[1:05:29] think about the gravity of it cowards
[1:05:32] die many times before their deaths and
[1:05:35] then when you live in fear and you're
[1:05:37] constantly living in the state of fear
[1:05:38] you're you're not really living you
[1:05:41] actually experience things the
[1:05:43] consequences of death dead you're afraid
[1:05:45] of dying yeah that's what you're doing
[1:05:47] but you're not dying in the South you're
[1:05:49] dying after the things of God you're
[1:05:50] missing what the kingdoms about but a
[1:05:53] man with courage a man that's bold a man
[1:05:55] with such a man mr. Newman in the upper
[1:05:58] room they were missing out on the
[1:05:59] kingdom but when the Holy Ghost come on
[1:06:01] their fear was gone
[1:06:02] let's have boldness they come out
[1:06:04] they're staggered like drunkards and
[1:06:06] then they got a little backbone in them
[1:06:08] praise the Lord listen the wicked flees
[1:06:10] with no man pursues but the righteous
[1:06:13] are as bold as a lion why do you have
[1:06:16] bonus because you know who's with you
[1:06:19] [Applause]
[1:06:22] you know I've often heard preachers they
[1:06:25] preached about the you know I was a
[1:06:26] younger brother and I had a big brother
[1:06:27] well I was the big brother I'm the
[1:06:30] oldest of my siblings so I was the
[1:06:32] brother if somebody picked on my little
[1:06:34] brother I'll go get him hey man I was
[1:06:37] that guy so I can't I can't preach from
[1:06:39] that perspective too much but I do know
[1:06:41] somebody picked on my little brother I'd
[1:06:42] be mad I'm gonna stick out phone cuz
[1:06:45] that's what you do right you're any big
[1:06:46] brother your kid is that right how much
[1:06:48] more you are Jesus amen listen if he's
[1:06:51] with you you don't have to be afraid not
[1:06:53] because you're so big and tougher
[1:06:55] because you're so smart it's who's with
[1:06:56] you you know he's with you because he's
[1:06:59] declared that's what the message is
[1:07:01] about so you don't have to guess was he
[1:07:04] with me is anyone maybe as many as you
[1:07:07] know he's here because he said it I said
[1:07:10] how do you know he's in the church
[1:07:11] building this morning not because that
[1:07:13] the building is special not because you
[1:07:16] painted a certain way put a cross in the
[1:07:18] wall you know he's here
[1:07:20] that's how you know he's here and if you
[1:07:23] know that he's here you know that all
[1:07:25] things are possible
[1:07:28] amen praise the Lord you look at the
[1:07:32] borderline believer you look in the days
[1:07:33] of the Exodus
[1:07:35] they come up through the wilderness
[1:07:37] Israel come through the wilderness and
[1:07:38] they didn't pass over and why do they
[1:07:40] fail to take the land they were afraid
[1:07:42] of Giants I mean they had ten back sling
[1:07:45] preachers they come in there preaching
[1:07:46] their false doctrine
[1:07:48] well there's Giants and there's this and
[1:07:50] that what were they preaching fear amen
[1:07:54] now listen every blessing was right
[1:07:55] across the way it wasn't far away every
[1:07:59] blessing was there but they were being
[1:08:00] preached fear
[1:08:01] well you don't love God you don't you
[1:08:03] know you want all this stuff in our
[1:08:04] church we don't want all this moving of
[1:08:06] the Holy Ghost and there's all this
[1:08:08] fanaticism people that preaching we got
[1:08:09] to be worried about fanaticism hey man
[1:08:11] and they get to a place where they're
[1:08:13] afraid we're the parents they're afraid
[1:08:16] to teach your children about the message
[1:08:18] listen you look at the laws of some of
[1:08:20] these countries nowadays the parents our
[1:08:22] friends our children but shouldn't have
[1:08:24] more power than the parents they're
[1:08:25] afraid of the consequences of raising a
[1:08:28] child the right way see they live in
[1:08:31] fear it's all based on fear is that
[1:08:33] right now parents are afraid to take
[1:08:35] their children teach them the truth amen
[1:08:37] well I'll have somebody else do it maybe
[1:08:38] the government or maybe the teacher I
[1:08:40] want the pastor to raise my children for
[1:08:42] me if you're a parent your job to raise
[1:08:43] your own children and then a job to tell
[1:08:46] them the truth
[1:08:48] then it's your job to teach them it's
[1:08:52] not somebody else's job we want
[1:08:54] everybody else to do all the work well I
[1:08:55] might mess up well I got this and I'm
[1:08:58] not capable amen well praise the Lord
[1:09:03] you know I think about society no I
[1:09:07] think about all the dumb things I did
[1:09:08] this young man because somebody dared me
[1:09:10] or egged me on you know how young men
[1:09:13] are while they're testosterones law more
[1:09:15] elevated than when you're in your 30s
[1:09:16] man they're trying to impress a girl to
[1:09:18] try and do something w every kind of
[1:09:20] crazy stuff every kind of stupid thing I
[1:09:22] did things like that hey man you've got
[1:09:25] young men this message they'll do all
[1:09:27] kinds of stupid stuff but no run with
[1:09:28] the crowd but they're afraid to take a
[1:09:29] stand for the Lord
[1:09:31] and then what is greater is that right
[1:09:33] we ought not to be afraid
[1:09:35] well praise the Lord brother Branham
[1:09:37] says this he said God hates a coward
[1:09:40] didn't someone he didn't have got hating
[1:09:42] anybody

[1:09:45] out fear it says if you've got love you
[1:09:47] don't have any fear I'll let that one
[1:09:51] sink in there for a second if you've got
[1:09:53] love you don't have any fear
[1:09:55] there's nothing fear all this is
[1:09:58] powerful fear doesn't have one bit of
[1:10:01] value about it

[1:13:04] God has saved and he's ashamed to tell

[1:13:08] Holy Ghost I haven't got much confidence
[1:13:11] in his salvation shoot but when you

[1:13:29] know I was a 23 year old man at the time
[1:13:31] when I first got the Holy Ghost I went
[1:13:33] to work I was working in the restaurant
[1:13:34] and I went to work I started testifying
[1:13:36] my buddy at work and this is not about
[1:13:38] the Holy Ghost of the Paragon and the
[1:13:40] boss he comes up and he says uh you can
[1:13:43] go home early today

[1:13:50] it would be like shoot praise God he
[1:13:53] said know what you go home early and I
[1:13:55] realized what it was about and I go home
[1:13:57] and I was kind of scared so I go back to
[1:13:58] my roommate and he was a believer he is
[1:14:01] a believer but I was talking to him I
[1:14:02] said yeah I got sent home from work
[1:14:04] early today

[1:14:27] what I do I'm gonna tell somebody this
[1:14:29] Holy Ghost that filling them people in
[1:14:31] the book of Acts that Holy Ghost are
[1:14:33] coming the promise meetings I know as a
[1:14:35] witness he did the same thing for me
[1:14:39] what heard voices around this message
[1:14:43] tell me it's not so it's not expected
[1:14:47] nomination I expect that from the girl
[1:14:49] Catholic Church but my concern is our
[1:14:51] people our children God's children are
[1:14:54] being taught well it's not so we just
[1:14:57] have a cream read a Dogma you just
[1:14:58] believe God sent a prophet the devil
[1:15:00] believes that God sent a prophet who
[1:15:02] wouldn't shake the fine power of the
[1:15:04] Holy Ghost strikes your heart when it
[1:15:07] comes and takes all that bitterness he
[1:15:09] takes that darkness he changes your life
[1:15:12] listen there's no words on a page that
[1:15:14] can substitute that there's no shaking a
[1:15:16] hand or a name on the book that can
[1:15:19] substitute that the real genuine
[1:15:21] Barragan I just believe it if you
[1:15:24] disagree you're free to disagree but for
[1:15:26] me in my house I just believed he's the
[1:15:28] same today
[1:15:30] My gods at 9 1965 the whole enuf thing
[1:15:34] go off the scene he's still here he's
[1:15:37] still powerful there man
[1:15:45] the Braun says you just can't keep still
[1:15:48] what the church needs is some more Holy
[1:15:50] Spirit and fire in it that moves it that
[1:15:53] moves the church takes fire to move the
[1:15:56] church listen it wasn't just good old
[1:15:59] gospel singing that moves the church
[1:16:00] it's not programs and in potlucks that's
[1:16:03] how that moves some people I tell you
[1:16:05] what the unit you won't see them for a
[1:16:07] year but you have free food and they
[1:16:08] show up it's not free food that moves
[1:16:11] the church and that promises of fame or
[1:16:14] money or programs or bigger building
[1:16:16] fire moves the Church of the Living God
[1:16:19] that's what moves me that's what moves
[1:16:21] use a believer not fear fire very
[1:16:26] brother gonna talk about that Mossback
[1:16:27] turtle he was a kid he had that turtle
[1:16:29] he got that thing out and that's thing
[1:16:30] he wouldn't move that turtle he said I
[1:16:32] know what I'll do you know what some
[1:16:34] preachers did I'll get a stick and be
[1:16:36] them look you don't know because Brian a
[1:16:39] man you drive cattle you lead sheep and
[1:16:42] then I don't have to make you serve God
[1:16:43] if you're a believer you'll serve God
[1:16:44] amen he went he beat that thing and he
[1:16:47] tried to rip that thing cause he was
[1:16:49] pulled back in his shell said I know
[1:16:51] what I'm doing baptize him I'll stick
[1:16:53] him in the water and he stuck that
[1:16:54] turtle down in the water he said he made
[1:16:56] a few bubbles that was about it who
[1:16:59] finally said I know what I'll do a lot
[1:17:02] of fire under him he said that sick
[1:17:05] stick that mean really lit a fire that
[1:17:08] surely ain't beginning to murder a man
[1:17:09] and listen when the Holy Ghost lots of
[1:17:12] fire in a church who can't stop it you
[1:17:15] can't put
[1:17:16] quench it what we need is the Holy Ghost
[1:17:20] and fire to move us that's what moves me
[1:17:24] that's what stirs my heart the meaning
[1:17:26] of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:28] sometimes he leads me to shout and
[1:17:31] sometimes it leads me to dances
[1:17:32] sometimes it leads me to praise God and
[1:17:34] I say praise God
[1:17:35] sometimes he leads me in a week
[1:17:37] sometimes we get real quiet hey man
[1:17:40] whatever it is I just want to know it's
[1:17:42] God that's all I hey man that's my
[1:17:45] concern I just want to be God I'm not
[1:17:47] trying to follow a program I'm not
[1:17:48] trying to make it happen there's a fire
[1:17:50] it's like shut up in my bones there's
[1:17:53] something on the inside walking toward
[1:17:55] the outside I can't keep it shut up I
[1:17:57] cannot forbear it's a fire well praise
[1:18:05] the Lord
[1:18:06] no brother branham this is the popular
[1:18:09] quote well the Rebbe said I'd rather
[1:18:12] have wild fire there's no fire at all
[1:18:17] and then I'll not promote wild fire but
[1:18:20] he said if I had kept that one I'd
[1:18:22] rather have wild fire and no fire at all
[1:18:25] which is remarkable to me because most
[1:18:28] message churches seem to feel the
[1:18:29] opposite we'd rather just have no fire
[1:18:35] in a while what we going to think we're
[1:18:36] for an axe you don't think we're out of
[1:18:37] control you go these churches well
[1:18:40] praise the Lord you go some of these
[1:18:42] churches they're preaching it's
[1:18:43] fanaticism we don't want any fanaticism
[1:18:44] in this church we don't we don't wanna
[1:18:45] bunch a wild fire like this is a big
[1:18:50] problem around the message well I'm just
[1:18:54] gonna be wrong astray see a man I could
[1:18:56] if I was inclined to do so and I'm not
[1:19:00] because I'm trying to be trying to be
[1:19:02] the bigger person I could make a list of
[1:19:06] churches that are formal in their worst
[1:19:09] messy searches that we just gotta dot
[1:19:11] every I of the right way gloss over to
[1:19:13] you you got it but I don't know and this
[1:19:18] is just me maybe maybe you know more
[1:19:19] people than I do I could probably count
[1:19:21] on one hand the number of message
[1:19:23] churches I know that they're just over
[1:19:25] my fanaticism and then we act like it's
[1:19:27] this big ol elf in the room
[1:19:29] and all the while people what do they do
[1:19:31] to lettuce in their lukewarm the Luke
[1:19:34] one condition is the conveyancing
[1:19:36] condition and we're afraid alarm fire
[1:19:38] like it's this big problem is just
[1:19:40] running around the message oh there's
[1:19:42] just too much sound there's just too
[1:19:43] much gifts and just too much of these
[1:19:45] movements all yo yeah then I see the
[1:19:49] whole room might as well get started
[1:19:53] here I'm still calm right now you
[1:19:56] thought that was great I'll leave a
[1:19:58] movie based on my own site
[1:19:59] I don't wanna praise got less than I
[1:20:01] praise them before I wanna praise him
[1:20:03] off I'm not looking to cry this thing
[1:20:06] down and and stick in the corner how
[1:20:08] would all people know people think we
[1:20:10] praise God too much hair and I praise
[1:20:12] God ah I'm already jumping on the
[1:20:15] chandeliers right now I mean I don't
[1:20:16] thinking homie oh I'm not worried about
[1:20:20] the fanaticism that's not what's killing
[1:20:22] the people today but they're freezing we
[1:20:24] preaching the frozen Chosin they say
[1:20:26] we've got all these people and they're
[1:20:28] freezing to death from the church and
[1:20:29] they're worried they've got their
[1:20:30] they've got their helmets on and they've
[1:20:32] got their body armor bless God there's
[1:20:34] no fanaticism coming my way
[1:20:38] freezing to death ain't got no fire
[1:20:41] ain't got no revile ain't got no
[1:20:43] testimony talk about things God didn't
[1:20:45] fifty years ago never seen God moving
[1:20:47] their own life but praise not they ain't
[1:20:49] got no fanaticism nearby what are we
[1:20:53] worried about
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:20:58] if you had to have one and again I'm not
[1:21:01] not trying to make you all Pentecost 2.0
[1:21:04] but if I had to have one I'd rather have
[1:21:07] the Wildfire then though fire well
[1:21:11] hallelujah huh and it's just like you
[1:21:14] know like this big rampant problem in
[1:21:17] the message churches are just obvious
[1:21:20] well phrase a little horde you know what
[1:21:23] happened is got company one time I
[1:21:25] believe the church order well brother we
[1:21:28] believe in church order in this church I
[1:21:30] believe in church order to probably
[1:21:32] you're going to put an order they have
[1:21:38] nothing to put in order we're gonna make
[1:21:40] sure the gifts in our and this and that
[1:21:41] and then they try to put something or
[1:21:49] there's nothing there to put an order
[1:21:51] they gotta have it to put in art well
[1:21:53] hallelujah listen it's church order not
[1:21:57] Church seat law carries with it the
[1:22:00] implication of fear it's fair well the
[1:22:05] friend of me out I'm afraid of this
[1:22:06] that's a law that's not the purpose of
[1:22:09] church think about this now the purpose
[1:22:11] of church are is not to hinder the move
[1:22:12] of the Holy Spirit it's actually to help
[1:22:14] the move of the Holy Spirit by having in
[1:22:17] an order it promotes though use and the
[1:22:19] moving of the Holy Ghost so if your
[1:22:22] vision for church orders nobody should
[1:22:24] move or say anything wherever you get in
[1:22:26] the spirit
[1:22:26] you're under a law and that field that
[1:22:29] consequences that law you're not caught
[1:22:31] a limit of that fear this church order
[1:22:34] it's supposed to out live you ain't got
[1:22:36] nothing to put an order what are you
[1:22:38] trying to put an order for people preach
[1:22:41] this stuff like oh yeah we just got it
[1:22:43] all figured out me and what they've done
[1:22:45] the back she hindered the movie you've
[1:22:46] got that's why they can't have her
[1:22:48] that's why they can't have joy that's
[1:22:50] why they can't move because they're
[1:22:51] afraid of what the Deacon or what
[1:22:53] somebody next one's gonna say well
[1:22:56] brother I've talked about a woman like
[1:22:57] that short I think is one of his
[1:22:58] meetings a man she come back to it to
[1:23:00] church after a while and she was in
[1:23:02] church one day and they were preach and
[1:23:03] she said a man and the deacon come up of
[1:23:06] all the people the Deacon come up
[1:23:09] problem here pinky come outside hey you
[1:23:11] gotta you gotta keep it down now come
[1:23:13] back after a while he preaches us I'm
[1:23:15] Ashley hallelujah he's coming in and you
[1:23:17] keep that down the third time she
[1:23:18] doesn't praise God
[1:23:20] he's his sister why he didn't get so
[1:23:21] loud why did he do that and she said
[1:23:24] because I got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:25] he said well you didn't get it here well
[1:23:31] hope she wasn't sitting one of these
[1:23:32] message churches shame on us if it is
[1:23:34] Amen we ought to have such a place
[1:23:37] Amen if somebody get the hug us sure
[1:23:39] they can get it here hopefully man and
[1:23:42] man I believe this is that kind of
[1:23:43] church I believe with that kind
[1:23:45] believers amen surely if something needs
[1:23:48] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is here
[1:23:51] let's see he's not an inn or something
[1:23:53] or adopted he's a person and he's here
[1:23:55] he's here to meet you need to come
[1:23:59] walking on the water to you that makes a
[1:24:06] statements in the sermon pride 55 I like
[1:24:09] this quote so much I have a whole sermon
[1:24:11] on it this one brother has this this is
[1:24:15] God I'm not against order but watch what
[1:24:17] he says here God helps to get out of
[1:24:20] order once in a while the trouble of is
[1:24:23] you've got too much order ceases you've
[1:24:25] got too much not God does you've got too
[1:24:29] much order get out of order I hope the
[1:24:33] church gets out of order long enough to
[1:24:35] get saved
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:42] take that devil hmm see we got too much
[1:24:49] horror and they were well we don't look
[1:24:51] that happy there we would be ashamed my
[1:24:53] mother and said they'd be ashamed they
[1:24:55] come up here snarling crying whooping
[1:24:56] and hollering tongue speaking axe to
[1:24:58] City they're ashamed but that's the only
[1:25:02] kind of the word brings fathers you know
[1:25:10] I realized something God's children are
[1:25:11] kind of like the kind like other
[1:25:13] children say what do you mean listen
[1:25:19] right in that when Billy was talking
[1:25:21] about that why doesn't she want to have
[1:25:22] a child it would embarrass her
[1:25:25] oh well certainly they caught up on your
[1:25:27] outfit they get stains and they break
[1:25:28] things they spell and then they make
[1:25:30] scene we don't want any children that
[1:25:32] would look unseemly that's why people
[1:25:34] don't laugh children it's it's a burden
[1:25:36] and it's it embarrasses us you're
[1:25:38] looking at the wrong way that's a
[1:25:41] blessing from the Lord listen I'm glad
[1:25:43] somebody put up with me when I was a
[1:25:45] little kid didn't know no better
[1:25:47] amen listen we shouldn't be ashamed of
[1:25:50] it amen but that's how our society
[1:25:52] that's how people are and it's the same
[1:25:53] way in church well if somebody come here
[1:25:55] and they're crying we we don't get tears
[1:25:57] on the carpet now well we don't have to
[1:25:59] get out the altar we don't wanna get
[1:26:01] down there and humble ourselves well I
[1:26:05] hope they get out order just long enough
[1:26:07] just long enough to get saved
[1:26:12] listen some people they're so worried
[1:26:15] some people some Christians they're so
[1:26:18] worried about making a mistake like that
[1:26:19] like I talked about that that woman play
[1:26:21] pray for the blue baby last time they're
[1:26:23] so worried about messing up and making a
[1:26:26] mistake they never actually try to do
[1:26:29] anything and that's worse
[1:26:34] they go to service after service and
[1:26:36] they walk out bound by fear if they
[1:26:38] don't overcome it they walk up bomb my
[1:26:40] fierce service I and God can move and
[1:26:42] God can bless and they can have a good
[1:26:44] test when they can have a Christian life
[1:26:45] yet somewhere inside there's something
[1:26:47] calling them to do something in order to
[1:26:49] live somewhere greater but they're
[1:26:51] afraid of the failure and they're afraid
[1:26:53] of the call that would come with it amen
[1:26:57] so the devil he peddles like these 12
[1:26:59] like these 10 spies he tells his
[1:27:01] doctrines and these ideas of fear and
[1:27:04] unbelief and they people will they go
[1:27:05] out bound because of fear and they live
[1:27:08] below the privileges brother Rama says
[1:27:10] that we live a million miles below our
[1:27:11] privilege why do we live there because
[1:27:15] of fear we're afraid of everything but
[1:27:21] the Lord which is the only one to be
[1:27:22] afraid of we're afraid of failure we're
[1:27:24] afraid of rejection we're free why I'll
[1:27:29] talk about this person in my life is a
[1:27:30] young man I was afraid of rejection
[1:27:31] you've heard my testimony I was afraid
[1:27:34] of rejection but listen the one who
[1:27:36] counts accepted me so why do I need to
[1:27:39] be afraid of rejection well you're
[1:27:41] afraid of somebody else you're afraid of
[1:27:44] people rise up against you they were
[1:27:46] hosting camp against me I won't fear cuz
[1:27:49] he's with me
[1:27:50] hey man when you rise the one behind you
[1:27:53] the one that's in you is greater than
[1:27:54] everything you're afraid of there's no
[1:27:56] reason to be afraid
[1:27:58] praise the Lord
[1:28:00] you know brother one talks about
[1:28:02] scarecrows everybody brother been
[1:28:04] talking about scarecrow hey man y'all
[1:28:06] know what scarecrow is right I was
[1:28:09] talking about this over in India I said
[1:28:10] I got out there the plane in India I
[1:28:12] said I walked out through the airport I
[1:28:14] went to the car and the brothers met me
[1:28:15] and I said you know what I noticed there
[1:28:17] wasn't one scarecrow in the airport like
[1:28:21] well yeah why would there be a scarecrow
[1:28:22] there exactly
[1:28:23] you don't put a scarecrow just anywhere
[1:28:26] where do you put a scarecrow out right
[1:28:29] in the middle of the field and then
[1:28:32] where the farmer doesn't want you to go
[1:28:33] that's where you put the scarecrow and
[1:28:36] then so the devil puts the scarecrow
[1:28:38] around the moving of the Holy Ghost why
[1:28:40] cuz that's where he doesn't want you to
[1:28:42] go
[1:28:43] well that's where the devil doesn't want
[1:28:45] you to go then guess where you should
[1:28:46] probably go and then you're afraid of
[1:28:49] the very thing God wants you to move
[1:28:51] towards it and the devil said oh you
[1:28:53] don't want to be identified with them
[1:28:54] you don't people call you Pentecostal
[1:28:57] they're gonna say oh well you're just a
[1:29:00] bunch of a fanatical Baptist I don't
[1:29:02] know what kind of Baptist they think
[1:29:04] well we're yeah I'm gonna get in trouble
[1:29:06] this one years ago I'm safer if I do
[1:29:10] that way years ago I was talking to
[1:29:12] somebody they were talking somebody come
[1:29:14] up to him because we were going to a
[1:29:15] certain church and somebody was saying
[1:29:16] well we go to we go to a message message
[1:29:20] church you go to a Pentecostal Church I
[1:29:23] said that's interesting I I've never
[1:29:25] read that quote I don't know where that
[1:29:27] distinction
[1:29:29] apparently they study the message more
[1:29:31] than I do I'm like oh this is the this
[1:29:33] is the Methodist kind of message Church
[1:29:35] and over here's the Pentecostal mass
[1:29:37] desertion where the message message
[1:29:39] Church I'm thinking I thought there was
[1:29:40] one message one faith one more woman but
[1:29:43] I'm not making these the phrase the Lord
[1:29:45] I'm not trying to make these distinction
[1:29:47] what I'm saying is people do this well
[1:29:48] well that's just this and that's just
[1:29:50] that what is that
[1:29:51] that's nothing what the Bible says it's
[1:29:52] not what the word says not saying
[1:29:56] everybody has to worship the same way
[1:29:58] please don't think I'm here to preach a
[1:30:00] cookie cutter religion because I'm not
[1:30:01] about that either nothin y'all don't
[1:30:04] worship the same way you'd be like this
[1:30:05] church for what I'm saying is why do we
[1:30:07] look at this and we test these names
[1:30:10] like it's some sort of a thing to insult
[1:30:13] or deride or make fun of them thing and
[1:30:15] praise the Lord
[1:30:15] well I am Pentecostal by birth and then
[1:30:19] that's that's not my denomination that's
[1:30:21] my experience
[1:30:22] so by New Birth I am Pentecostal that's
[1:30:25] true hey man but I'm not part of an
[1:30:26] organization I'm part of an organism the
[1:30:29] body of Christ and then and you're a
[1:30:32] member and Eiling them and the member
[1:30:34] together edifies itself in their love
[1:30:35] amen that's why we come together it's
[1:30:37] the same body so here comes a scarecrow
[1:30:43] he's up in the middle of blessing listen
[1:30:45] if he's in the middle of this blessing
[1:30:47] then that's what I want
[1:30:48] and then the Scarecrow is an indicator
[1:30:51] where you should actually go because
[1:30:52] they only put the Scarecrow up so that's
[1:30:54] where you need to go amen whatever
[1:30:56] you're afraid of in your life that's
[1:30:57] exactly what God wants for you don't let
[1:31:01] the devil scare you from it no don't let
[1:31:03] the devil scare you from a greater
[1:31:04] testimony from a greater sanctification
[1:31:06] from a greater walk a greater prayer
[1:31:08] life why would you be afraid of those
[1:31:09] things well I don't want to testify
[1:31:11] somebody might think of a fanatic or
[1:31:17] maybe someone get saves so we always
[1:31:19] look at the negative the kingdom of God
[1:31:22] is not negative it's positive
[1:31:23] well it might fail but it might succeed
[1:31:25] what might not work but it might see
[1:31:28] this was that quarterly well could it
[1:31:30] happen not only can it happen it will
[1:31:32] happen because he said it amen
[1:31:34] it's not my promise I don't have to back
[1:31:37] it up I don't have to vindicate it he's
[1:31:39] the one that said it it's not on me to
[1:31:42] perform
[1:31:43] it's not on you it's just for it's for
[1:31:45] us to believe Amen that's how God works
[1:31:50] raise little heart that's what the
[1:31:54] happen was Israel they put a scarecrow
[1:31:55] up there in the land oh we can't take
[1:31:57] those giants there's walled cities
[1:32:00] colleagues and kings and what's greater
[1:32:04] amen
[1:32:05] see they preached fear to the people and
[1:32:07] the people receive it they didn't cross
[1:32:09] over because of fear uncertainty and
[1:32:11] fear was the only thing it wasn't
[1:32:13] distance wasn't the lack of a promise
[1:32:16] and wasn't the lack of anything the only
[1:32:18] thing that held the Mac was fear and
[1:32:19] uncertainty amen
[1:32:21] the praise God for a Joshua in a Caleb
[1:32:23] they had a different spirit they said we
[1:32:26] are more than able to take the land
[1:32:29] and brothers and sisters let me testify
[1:32:31] to you this afternoon I don't care what
[1:32:33] some of the preacher is sad or what some
[1:32:36] person is said if God said it in this
[1:32:38] Bible or he said in this message you can
[1:32:40] believe for it you don't have to be
[1:32:42] ashamed you don't have to back up on it
[1:32:44] you're up explaining you have to
[1:32:46] compromise you don't have to sell out
[1:32:48] you can believe it as the Lord said it
[1:32:50] this bride she has left saith the Lord
[1:32:53] and she knows what he was that was it
[1:32:56] but see then give us at the Lord to sit
[1:32:59] on it or stick it in the ground or just
[1:33:02] a war appeal taking you thus saith the
[1:33:04] Lord to be an overcomer he wants you to
[1:33:08] take the line and just possess every
[1:33:10] evil spirit and everything happening
[1:33:12] that's contrary to him in your home and
[1:33:15] in your life every evil thing in every
[1:33:18] dark power you have the ability to
[1:33:20] Christ nothing to see most of it got to
[1:33:24] the feast holder to defeat every enemy
[1:33:27] any place anywhere anytime I'm not
[1:33:34] satisfied with with a partial victory
[1:33:40] this this is my competitive side coming
[1:33:43] out but you know what they say about
[1:33:44] second place second place is just the
[1:33:46] first loser
[1:33:46] I don't want to be second place in the
[1:33:53] key McGraw listen we've had the boat on
[1:33:55] pass to us
[1:33:56] that's not me racing against you that's
[1:33:59] not what it is but we run the race with
[1:34:00] patience together and then we're not
[1:34:04] here to overcome almost everything we've
[1:34:07] heard overcome every power of the enemy
[1:34:10] I've been with this bride is leaving
[1:34:12] this world in a defeated condition
[1:34:14] maliciously losing condition I wish is
[1:34:18] going out like they left that prom it
[1:34:20] was like they left Egypt for the
[1:34:21] promised land will not leave a hook
[1:34:23] behind we'll take all the riches we'll
[1:34:25] take a little spoil we'll take our loved
[1:34:27] ones will take their young we'll take my
[1:34:29] old and any enemy that tries to follow
[1:34:33] us will be utterly destroyed I'm going
[1:34:36] to a place well I won't see those
[1:34:38] enemies anymore now listen that's not
[1:34:41] just heaven the promises the Holy Ghost
[1:34:44] that means in this life there are things
[1:34:48] there are fears in your life maybe this
[1:34:50] morning this afternoon things in your
[1:34:52] life that maybe you rested with your
[1:34:53] whole life maybe you want to fear or
[1:34:55] whatever it is you don't have to see it
[1:34:57] ever again God is able to make away
[1:35:00] where there is no way and I want to
[1:35:03] overthrow that enemy you don't have to
[1:35:06] live with insecurity you'd have to live
[1:35:09] with self-loathing and doubt and
[1:35:10] wondering am I good enough am i this of
[1:35:12] that you can watch that and leave me
[1:35:14] over overthrown in this life I don't
[1:35:18] want you to put that out there somewhere
[1:35:19] else your eyes today you can have
[1:35:22] victory
[1:35:26] remember the bread says this he says
[1:35:29] Joshua and all this knowing that the
[1:35:31] command was great but having the
[1:35:33] assurance he could be fearless I like
[1:35:37] how he says this he could be as we
[1:35:39] caught reckless woo a man as long as he
[1:35:44] was putting the right way and I'm a
[1:35:46] comma the recklessness of youth or
[1:35:48] inexperience I'm talking about the
[1:35:50] recklessness that comes when you're
[1:35:51] doing your point of the right way what
[1:35:53] didn't know it's God that Senate he's
[1:35:55] pointing the right way you can be
[1:35:57] reckless
[1:35:59] listen Elijah oh my when he went up and
[1:36:02] fix them promised the bail he did just
[1:36:04] rebuild altars they got cups of water on
[1:36:06] it
[1:36:06] I've dumped some more you don't dig a
[1:36:08] trench I do whatever you want
[1:36:10] he's got pretty bold because he had the
[1:36:13] word of the Lord he could be rolled he
[1:36:16] knew that God given a commandment that
[1:36:18] he would call fire down from heaven
[1:36:20] we've got a commander and said there's
[1:36:22] nothing that could stop that there
[1:36:24] wasn't a whole water and the Sea of
[1:36:25] Galilee to stop it and then there wasn't
[1:36:28] a prophet the battle on the back and
[1:36:32] when you realize God has called you and
[1:36:33] commissioned you and you realized that
[1:36:35] cause you can be reckless as long as
[1:36:37] your point of the right way he might
[1:36:40] break up against the hill that would
[1:36:41] knock him backwards but he was carried
[1:36:43] the right way soaked in the charge of
[1:36:45] the Living God be reckless in fearless
[1:36:47] in faith if we're pointed the right way
[1:36:49] for he said as I was with Moses I'll be
[1:36:52] with you I'll not fail you I'll not
[1:36:54] forsake you he never forsaken Moses he
[1:36:59] never found Moses he will not fail
[1:37:02] Joshua he will not fail us he'll be with
[1:37:05] us why am I saying all this I want you
[1:37:09] to come up higher amen if you're living
[1:37:11] in fear don't live there another day
[1:37:13] don't don't choose to live the hairy man
[1:37:16] you said what I've got this and I'm got
[1:37:18] that I understand you can't overcome by
[1:37:21] yourself that's why you didn't leave you
[1:37:22] alone that's why he's here a man listen
[1:37:28] I understand my nature especially not
[1:37:31] I'm as I get older I'm a cautious person
[1:37:34] I was I try to teach the children don't
[1:37:36] take unnecessary risks like climbing a
[1:37:38] tree right before church this morning
[1:37:42] look if I looked at me there's there's
[1:37:48] six other days in the week to do that
[1:37:49] why would you there right before church
[1:37:50] and I get cautioned there's nothing
[1:37:54] wrong with caution actually is a good
[1:37:55] thing
[1:37:55] amen because and shouldn't you shouldn't
[1:37:58] you shouldn't be reckless for the sake
[1:37:59] of being reckless you know I know some
[1:38:01] people well this is this that and I'm
[1:38:03] gonna be this and the Lord told me that
[1:38:05] well is it the word though amen
[1:38:07] but listen when Peter and then we've
[1:38:09] talked we wear this in our scripture
[1:38:11] when Peter saw the Lord coming he said
[1:38:13] you know what that's really God he's
[1:38:16] really the same that's the same Jesus if
[1:38:19] he's walking in the water then that
[1:38:20] means I can walk on the water
[1:38:23] think about this Jesus didn't come to
[1:38:25] show you or do anything that you can't
[1:38:28] do by the spirit the same and then when
[1:38:31] He healed the sick he healed the sick so
[1:38:32] his disciples would realize you can do
[1:38:34] the same thing and then when he overcome
[1:38:38] darkness when he multiplied the loaves
[1:38:40] when he walked on water
[1:38:41] it was so his disciples to realize if
[1:38:44] you believe you can do the same thing
[1:38:47] the works I do shall you do also and
[1:38:51] greater than these so you do because I
[1:38:53] know the father he wasn't showing you
[1:38:55] something just impress you but he's
[1:38:57] showing you this is what they're capable
[1:38:58] of if you believe I'm I feel good if he
[1:39:08] did it amen I think about the things
[1:39:11] that he did to show you that you are
[1:39:13] capable if you've seen in this mountain
[1:39:15] amen
[1:39:16] not if he says if you say to this
[1:39:18] mountain be thou removed and cast in the
[1:39:20] sea and don't doubt your heart you shall
[1:39:22] have what you ask
[1:39:24] he's trying should have confidence not
[1:39:27] in your flesh but in what he's put in
[1:39:28] your life see when you have fear you
[1:39:31] don't really have faith in a man some of
[1:39:36] us are our own biggest critic but I want
[1:39:38] you understand his maybe you're your own
[1:39:40] biggest critic you may be you have a lot
[1:39:41] of critics but you've got one that's
[1:39:43] giving you a seal of approval
[1:39:46] he's approved your faith he's approved
[1:39:48] you for the kingdom he's sealed through
[1:39:50] the day your Redemption hey doesn't
[1:39:52] matter how much how much incurred or
[1:39:54] discouragement you go through how
[1:39:56] disappoint you get he's already sealed
[1:39:58] you get him Hannah here comes Peter says
[1:40:01] I want to walk on the water Lord if
[1:40:02] that's you you did me come you know what
[1:40:06] he said come he doesn't have to play a
[1:40:10] four-hour tape for him hey man like the
[1:40:13] woman well she only had to hear once and
[1:40:15] then he said come now listen I can
[1:40:18] prevent brother Brent talks about this
[1:40:19] Peter didn't have to get down pray about
[1:40:21] it first didn't have to fast 40 days
[1:40:23] you've got to study it out when he knew
[1:40:25] was the Lord and the Lord said calm you
[1:40:27] know what he did well I don't know of
[1:40:29] the other disciples what they'll think
[1:40:31] about me if I can get out of the water
[1:40:32] they're gonna they're gonna think I'm a
[1:40:33] fanatic he didn't care about any of that
[1:40:35] hear the Lord say come guess what he did
[1:40:37] he come out of the boat he's walking on
[1:40:40] the water here here's a man this is my
[1:40:46] my optimistic side you know we often
[1:40:49] focused about how you know eventually
[1:40:51] Peter sink yeah when he got afraid see
[1:40:54] fear didn't do him one good it actually
[1:40:55] hindered him we talked about Peter all
[1:40:58] if he don't believe you want to sunk but
[1:40:59] I want you to realize he did walk on
[1:41:00] water a man while he believes he did the
[1:41:04] same thing Jesus did he walk on the
[1:41:06] water amen
[1:41:07] and listen we funny how people criticize
[1:41:10] no Peter I have a fight a bit me well at
[1:41:15] least he walked on the water first
[1:41:18] well coming walking on water in Ohio's
[1:41:21] was 32 degrees or colder this man walked
[1:41:25] on not just water but a water in a
[1:41:27] stormy sea and what I love about this
[1:41:32] then he was afraid listen I'm not saying
[1:41:34] they're good hey man I'm not saying
[1:41:36] never be tempted to be afraid as a
[1:41:37] Christian I hope you understand that
[1:41:39] what I'm saying is there's one greater
[1:41:41] than the fear and when he become afraid
[1:41:43] and when he'd be into sick Jesus didn't
[1:41:45] say well that's what you get you know
[1:41:46] good unbeliever well if you had faith I
[1:41:50] wouldn't have to even be here like some
[1:41:54] people well come on Peter we need you
[1:41:57] step it up man he didn't say well get in
[1:42:02] the water you you know he did he took
[1:42:07] his hand he lifted him up the ramp said
[1:42:10] we as believers have the same lives if
[1:42:13] we find that we are sinking we have the
[1:42:15] same right to call him to pick us up so
[1:42:20] don't be worried about failing just even
[1:42:22] if you falter he'll still pick you up
[1:42:25] I want that encourages somebody we're so
[1:42:32] afraid of failing we look at we look at
[1:42:34] his failure what we forget is success we
[1:42:37] look at families in life we forget about
[1:42:39] all that God's done for us well but I
[1:42:41] made a mistake here and I messed this up
[1:42:42] what about all the things God did do in
[1:42:44] your life look at what he's done that's
[1:42:48] why it's so important to testify what
[1:42:49] he's done amen praise the Lord
[1:42:54] I'm so grateful no he's got
[1:42:57] he's got your hand maybe sit here today
[1:43:02] you hear this a lot just I wish that was
[1:43:03] for me
[1:43:04] he's got your hand that's what makes the
[1:43:07] difference not me saying it it's who's
[1:43:10] saying it it's who's doing it the same
[1:43:12] one is holding your hand I can't hold
[1:43:15] your hand everywhere in laughs your past
[1:43:17] you can't hold your hand everywhere but
[1:43:18] Jesus is here he'll take you by the hand
[1:43:20] he has able to lift you the Bible says
[1:43:23] he's able to keep you from falling this
[1:43:29] is how you're able to keep you he is
[1:43:32] able to keep you so even if you touch
[1:43:35] your own even if you begin to falter
[1:43:37] he'll stop you from going underwire
[1:43:40] [Applause]
[1:43:41] listen he didn't walk all the way out
[1:43:43] there in the middle of a storm to let
[1:43:45] you drown because you followed his word
[1:43:48] amen he's not gonna cook he's like a
[1:43:51] little mountain pray and do all this and
[1:43:53] come down and come to you and say don't
[1:43:56] be a friends that wasn't you I didn't
[1:44:00] know you'd mess up that bad I wanted to
[1:44:02] come out here the first place amen
[1:44:06] he's not like that amen that's not his
[1:44:11] nature he's giving you every reason not
[1:44:13] to be afraid even if he would but even
[1:44:17] if you would you would you would make a
[1:44:18] mistake or fault to a man he's greater
[1:44:21] than the mistake listen that's what it's
[1:44:24] not that you don't have fear it's that
[1:44:26] perfect love casts it out I mean he's
[1:44:29] greater than the fear he's greater than
[1:44:32] the circumstance it's not that there is
[1:44:34] no trial it's not that there is no fear
[1:44:37] don't get this up it's not this mind
[1:44:39] over matter saying Amen brother time
[1:44:40] talks about healing that way it's not
[1:44:42] that you're not sick we're just trying
[1:44:43] to convince you it's not Christian
[1:44:44] science
[1:44:45] you are sick but the healer is greater
[1:44:48] than the sickness greater is He that's
[1:44:51] next missing the boat with you then the
[1:44:54] storm is all around you you believe that
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] he that fears the Bible says is not made
[1:45:04] perfect in life
[1:45:05] you understand it's perfect over there
[1:45:09] this is perfect laughs hey man listen
[1:45:12] the rapture the rapture is not made for
[1:45:16] the fearful hey man I'm just gonna bring
[1:45:19] it down here for a second the Bible
[1:45:20] tells you where the fearful lot there
[1:45:21] outside the city amen
[1:45:23] but you're not made perfect in fear
[1:45:26] where you made perfect in love
[1:45:30] amen that's where you're made perfect
[1:45:32] listen God does not desire for you to
[1:45:35] live in fear you believe that this
[1:45:40] message is more than just doctrine it's
[1:45:42] more than information it's him
[1:45:45] his voice his assurance I'm not going to
[1:45:48] let you sink you might feel like you're
[1:45:52] going to but I'm not going to listen if
[1:45:55] our hearts condemn us he's greater than
[1:45:58] your heart they realized that I could
[1:46:03] testify his Paul I am persuaded there's
[1:46:06] nothing that can separate us if he's got
[1:46:09] you in his hand even when you are
[1:46:11] tempted to fear and disbelieve maybe
[1:46:14] you're in that situation this afternoon
[1:46:16] maybe you're sitting there going through
[1:46:18] the worst try your life I don't know
[1:46:19] what y'all going through but maybe he
[1:46:21] rose in the storm of your lives and it
[1:46:23] feels like God's a million miles away I
[1:46:24] want you to know he's here and he's got
[1:46:26] your hand you don't have to walk out of
[1:46:29] those doors carrying the burden of fear
[1:46:31] and worry laying awake at night will he
[1:46:34] accept me will he help me he's been
[1:46:36] accepted in the beloved if he's got you
[1:46:39] in his hand there's nothing that can
[1:46:40] separate you
[1:46:42] if the storm can't pull him under they
[1:46:46] can't stop him from pulling you up hey
[1:46:49] man my my he's an ever-present help in
[1:46:54] the times of trouble no don't be afraid
[1:46:56] of for NASA fanaticism and all this if
[1:46:58] you ever get a chance maybe you probably
[1:47:00] hopefully listen to it but brother Ram
[1:47:02] preachers got a hidden simplicity after
[1:47:03] the seals
[1:47:04] an Albuquerque New Mexico in 1964 he's
[1:47:06] doing altar call people are getting the
[1:47:08] Holy Ghost and he says see he's talking
[1:47:10] about certain minister he said they
[1:47:11] begin to move on him and said because he
[1:47:13] couldn't surrender he was afraid of it
[1:47:15] they said if he had just surrendered
[1:47:18] to it and then if he just we're on
[1:47:21] through with it God would have less time
[1:47:22] a man and brother babies don't be afraid
[1:47:24] of fanaticism if there's finessin we
[1:47:27] would know it
[1:47:28] listen the devil don't want to come in
[1:47:30] here and help you out he's not here to
[1:47:34] bless you but all of the people to
[1:47:37] praise God louder want the people to
[1:47:39] shout I want the people to do that
[1:47:42] that's God amen
[1:47:44] you don't want you to be afraid listen
[1:47:47] if there's a you can stand your feet
[1:47:48] listen if there's anywhere there's
[1:47:51] anything all rise
[1:47:53] if there's anywhere if there's any way
[1:47:57] you ought to feel comfortable worshiping
[1:47:59] the Lord it should be here is that right
[1:48:02] we're believers we believe I know I know
[1:48:04] you like to worship the Lord I heard you
[1:48:06] all this morning but what I want you to
[1:48:09] understand is when you go out of this
[1:48:11] building nothing changes about who you
[1:48:13] are amen
[1:48:14] he doesn't stay in here he goes with you
[1:48:18] if he's with you there's no reason to be
[1:48:20] afraid it's what I encourage you don't
[1:48:24] live a life of fear don't don't live a
[1:48:26] life spent and worried some people
[1:48:28] they're there long tighter than a yo-yo
[1:48:30] I tell you huh just everything's a big
[1:48:32] deal we're always afraid God doesn't God
[1:48:35] didn't create the human heart to worry
[1:48:36] brother Ram Singh I think you said 80%
[1:48:39] of sickness is caused by nervousness and
[1:48:41] worry God don't want that for you amen
[1:48:44] you believe that see I wanna hear you
[1:48:47] testify God don't want that for me
[1:48:50] sometimes we sometimes we think God
[1:48:52] doesn't want it for your neighbor for
[1:48:54] the preacher but he does for me no God
[1:48:58] doesn't want you to live in worry in
[1:48:59] fear he wants you to have Liberty he
[1:49:02] wants you to have boldness you should be
[1:49:05] able to look the devil right in the eye
[1:49:06] and tell him get out of my house
[1:49:08] get out of my life you're not taking my
[1:49:10] paralyzed you're not taking my children
[1:49:12] you're not welcome to anything I'm not
[1:49:13] going to sink I'm not gonna be pulled
[1:49:16] under there's a power greater than me
[1:49:18] that's holding me up
[1:49:19] I can't sink even if I want to let's bow
[1:49:29] our heads Father we're just so thankful
[1:49:31] Lord ah maybe a simple thought but a
[1:49:35] thing many people many of your children
[1:49:38] they wrestle with father weren't an age
[1:49:40] of fearfulness lower the scripture tells
[1:49:42] us that men's hearts in this age would
[1:49:45] fail for fear well it's a more
[1:49:48] treacherous and more wicked a more evil
[1:49:50] time than other believers in the past
[1:49:54] have had to face the darkness it's a
[1:49:59] gross darkness all but I'm so thankful
[1:50:02] for a life that shines light was able to
[1:50:08] illuminate our understanding to guide us
[1:50:11] to drive out every feeder to push back
[1:50:15] all the darkness Lord I believe today
[1:50:19] for your children that are here Lord I
[1:50:23] believe there's some I've seen people
[1:50:25] that are just a they're afraid to even
[1:50:27] serve God because they're so afraid
[1:50:29] they'll fail Lord what a what a
[1:50:32] condition to live in Lord ah I don't
[1:50:37] believe you want us to live in fear I
[1:50:39] know you don't want us to live in fear
[1:50:40] you you made a way you took out the
[1:50:42] sting of death Lord we're not the
[1:50:46] fearful but we're the believing today
[1:50:48] we're the bold the righteous we can
[1:50:50] declare with certainty Lord that we are
[1:50:53] your chosen people God has filled us
[1:50:56] with his spirit he's strengthened us in
[1:50:58] our body he's given us a voice to praise
[1:51:00] Him
[1:51:02] what I pray you bless each one father if
[1:51:05] there be one here today but if there be
[1:51:07] one here today in the son of my voice
[1:51:09] that's carried a burden of fear maybe
[1:51:12] something from the time they were a
[1:51:13] child
[1:51:14] maybe something recent whatever it is
[1:51:15] maybe they throw that burden down at
[1:51:18] your feet today better than a walkout
[1:51:19] free of it I ask father may be glorified
[1:51:22] their midst he's thinking Jesus Christ
