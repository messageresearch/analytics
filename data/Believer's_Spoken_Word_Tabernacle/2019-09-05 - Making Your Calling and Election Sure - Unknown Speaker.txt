Heavenly Father we come approaching you now at this point of the service Lord Father we've heard the worship of the people growing up felt the presence of God here in our Miss now Lord as youth the way is repaired we asked for you to come open the Word of Life to a story I pray you'll anoint me father as I stand in this place to bring glory to You Lord to be a help to your people we asked these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to the glory of God amen why are standing turn with me in your Bibles to 2nd Peter chapter 1 what I want to speak on tonight is here--he him verse 10 second Peter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather brother give diligence to make your calling and election sure means steadfast for if you do these things you shall never fall down to verse 16 for we have not followed cunning devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased amen you may be seated how do we know that God is with us it's not by our numbers God has met with sometimes he meets with great numbers sometimes meets with small numbers one time he met with 500 another time with 70 another time with 12 times with three and he's met with one so it's not it's not the number that determines it but it's the attitude of the people you take an egg from some foul chicken or a duck or whatever and if you put it in an incubator it it'll hatch that egg because it's the atmosphere and if he can get us into one Accord that's what he's looking forward to get us into one Accord in one line then it'll create an atmosphere to where if there were any lost in ability they get saved before they left if there was any sick they get healed before they left all we got to do is have the right atmosphere created and we could have another Pentecost in Matthew 17:5 is the scripture that Peter is referring to this account that Matthew gives in 1705 he says while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace were upon him and by His stripes we were healed it's past tense it's already done we're not waiting for God to do something more he's already done it it's the finished work and this the the message that God sent by this endtime messenger was a finished work - we're not we're not looking for that he needs to come back to finish anything because that would be against the scripture for the scripture said when he began to sound the mystery of God would be finished yes so it's done paid for it's finished it's all complete he died at Calvary for every sin that would ever be committed wherever was committed it was forgiven on the basis of his blood he knows all things he knew every he knew every word you would ever speak he knew every step you would ever take he knew every path you would ever follow he knew what time that he would call you he knew when you would recognize the call he knew when the father would draw you here you him it won't do you any good though until you accept it it's got to become your personal property your it's got to be based on your personal faith Christ has already done it for you here um the RAM said no man ever sought God at anytime it was always God seeking after man he said it wasn't Adam in the garden saying Father who art where are you but it was God going through the garden saying Adam who art thou and this brother branham said are to settle it that if there's a question your mind he said this ought to settle it Jesus said no man could come to me except the father draws him first you want to know whether you're called did the father draw you what what drew you here what drew you to him what drew you to this endtime message it was the father every time the devil comes and tries to say well you know what you're not one of them you're not going to make it you're gonna be one of ones that's left behind you're gonna be one of the ones that's calling around all panic because you can't get ahold of nobody you can say no the father drawled me he brought me to this I didn't bring myself to this [Music] because the nature of man is always to go the other way the nature of man is to run the nature of man is darkness but he is liked and brother branham said when you get saved he said there's a little light inside you by the size of a button amen and he said then that as you begin to mature that begins to grow but he says that's a little light then that's shining out of the darkness the wonder jesus said you are a lot you are the light of the world God by his foreknowledge he's omnipresent means he's everywhere fills all space he's omnipotent which means he knows everything he's omnipotent which means he's able to do anything so he's everywhere he's able to do anything and he knows everything and it's because of that that he could say before Jacob marisol was even born that I hate Esau and love Jacob because he knew already what kind of a man that Esau would be he already knew what would be in Esau's art he already knew what would be Esau stinking he already knew what would be Esau choices he knew everything he knew every word that he saw whatever speak he knew every thought that he saw would ever think and he knew every he knew what would be on Jacobs heart he knew what Jacob would see captor he knew what Jacobs choices would be God knowing all he knew you he knew everything you would ever do everything ever be he knew every he not only knew all the good things you would ever do but he knew all the bad things you would ever do I like on that song when he was on the cross I was on his mind said he knew me yet he loved me he knew everything I would ever be know every mistake I'd ever make every fault I ever had he knew all of that he knew all the wrongs that I would ever do yet he loved me why did he love me because I belong to you all I needed to be was I needed to be born again he is the inexhaustible fountain of life I've heard people say well look at all the blessings God has blessed me with look at what all God has given me let me tell you something material things is not a sign of God's blessings it's not a sign that God is with you David said that had he considered the wicked he spread forth like a great bay tree God said have you considered his end have you considered his in there are there are people that possess a lot of material things in this life and yet they still haven't found what they're searching for I would rather be making my investments over there than making my investments here it's like that story brother Branham talks about where he went and saw that that one rancher and he said took him out and he showed him his great stretch of Valley in their leases everywhere as far as you can see said I owned it he took him to the town he said everything in this town you see the bait there I own it brother Branham says how much do you own up there the closest that's that's where we want our treasure to be because the Bible says where your treasure is there will your heart be also I don't I don't look for these I don't want to own one thing I can't leave behind the song says amen some people think maybe that God couldn't want them that is but it's not based upon your works it's based upon the grace of God by grace ye are saved brother Branham talks about when he went into a little Museum in Tennessee and he says he saw there an analysis of the human body you remember and it said that that this body when it was all down to what it was made of was worth about 84 cents and he says and people are go out and they'll put $100 fur coat which would be more than $100 today on an 80 on 84 cents a $50 hat on 84 cents and he said why he was standing there thinking on that things there was two men standing there and the one man said the other said well you know what we're not worth very much are we brother Branham said no you're not he spoke to him said no you're not worth very much but your soul is worth 10 million well this body ain't worth much but this body is not what's going to inherit the kingdom it's not it's not flesh and blood you know to believe the Bible you have to believe in election throughout the Bible it talks about the elect lady and it speaks about election and God you know he elected us by foreknowledge and I'm thankful for the election of God I'm thankful that it's not based upon the good I could do and friends I don't want to stand in the judgment where the basis is the good you've done versus the evil you've done I don't want justice brother Adam said he lives you represented justice they sent army out after Elijah and he said if I be a man of God let the fire come down out of heaven and consume you and fire fell down and consumed them the King thought well maybe that was just a fluke so he sent out another army to go get Elijah and Elisha said if I be a man of God let fire come down out of heaven and consumed in fire consumed that was God's justice I don't want I don't plead for God's justice because what I deserve by his justice what we deserve we deserve hell but the lamb was worthy it's not we don't look at her selves one man told brother Branham he said I don't feel like I'm worthy he said I don't feel like I've been trying he said to get the Holy Ghost but I don't feel like I'm worthy he said I look at myself and I'm not worthy brother Adam said it's not yourself you need to look at because if you're looking at yourself you're not worthy but what we look on is our sacrifice which is worthy and if the sacrifice is worthy then you're worthy think about what Christ as a man Jesus had a decision to make would he you know Jesus a man would have loved to have stayed with his disciples but he had a decision to make and friends he went to the cross for you see I already knew that but how do you really know it he went for you in other words he felt you were worth it you were worth dying for God does the calling he does the choosing he does the elect me Jiri him you know people a lot of times the first come to the Lord one of the things that that devil fights them over is whether they're going to make it or not and you know I've seen people come to the Lord and then the whole time the devil tell them you're just gonna disappoint everybody because there's nothing nothing's happened to you you ain't changed a bit but I'll tell you something friends it isn't the drastic that we look for it's two little things the drastic will come but God changed this one little thing at a time he first changes your heart changes your desire God didn't come down and say look stop wearing this and stop doing that and stop doing this and throw this away and throw that away know what he does is he comes down and changes your desire and you stop doing those things and you throw away the wrong things why it's not because it's a law but it's because you love him because something in you has come alive and something is following you something keeps calling you and it's not you it's Christ in you that does the things dogs got it all in control you realize in your life nothing can go wrong you say well I've had a lot of things go wrong in my life but look at the whole scope of the big picture where are you at today you're not going to go wrong amen when he's got it in control then you can't go wrong and and this word says that all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord that are the called according to his purpose we are called according to his purpose therefore everything is going to work together for your good because the friends why are you here tonight you're not here because of some law or some fear that you'll go to heaven so you're not here you come here because you love the Lord you want to worship Him and you want to hear from him that's why you come you come to hear him that ought of resolve doubts closed look when God was getting ready to take Elijah off the scene the other band said there might have been some of the the profits down in the school of profits they might have been some of them thinking I'll take a largest place God's getting ready to take him out take his place I'll wear his robe when he's done with it but God didn't choose out of the school of the prophets and said he went out and chose a young man that was plowing in the field to take care of his mother and father and he chose God already knew before the world began that it was going to be either Elijah was ill he was going to call to take up in Elijah's stand and God knew that look we have had so many dear loved ones and Christians and soldiers fellow soldiers that have went on to be with the Lord and there's been many that maybe you never and I never even personally know but they knew this endtime message they've lived their life and they've lived their time and now they've went on but God knew who would follow up in their footsteps he knew it would be you because you were the ones he chose and you know what when he chose you you come in the season that he is four ordained for you to come Ian he phone ain't you for this age I don't know if I can make it look he's followed age you for this age you can go make it because why because there has to be overcomers from this age any or date you to be an overcomer earlier there were over comers in every age we go through things because brother Brennan said gob couldn't save you today pull you through a pipe and bring you out on the other end and say to the overcomer because he said you wouldn't have overcome anything you're not in a bubble once you receive the Holy Ghost that's that that's the teacher that's your instructor but you're not in a bubble we're actually in a flesh that's still in contact through the five senses to this world unfortunately but God knew you before the world was ever formed lebreton said you're not saved by your works it's by grace you're saved it's a gift of God Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him first all that come to me then they are God's love gifts to Christ you're not yours but you belong to Christ the father has draws you out of your life of sin and giving you to Christ and Christ sent the Holy Spirit to tutor you or to raise you to believe him and brought down his schoolbooks amen notice that I'm so glad he said the law can't save you here you him he's the only one that has the salvation he's the only one that can give you life he's the only one that can give you healing he's the only one that can take away my burden he's the only one who can raised me up at the last day that's the reason hear ye him hallelujah what did Jesus we said Elijah stood for justice what did Jesus stand for the love of God grace was brought by Christ amen this look in John chapter 1 verse 11 through 13 he came unto his own and his own received or not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor the will of man but of God what is this word power mean here it means the ability the authority that authority to become sons of God you had the ability to become sons of God now I look at this scripture and we're says he gave you the power to become sons of God and yet at the same time I know you always were a son or daughter of God and so what is this scripture meaning it's meaning he gave you the ability to be born again you were in your father before you ever came into this world the germ comes from the man the woman has the egg or the end of bedding ground but the germ comes from the man so you were in your father but you hadn't been expressed yet and that's the way it is with us in God we were in God from the beginning if we're eternal now we always were so we never had a beginning we were always in Him who is eternal and never had a beginning think about that if we were always in him and he never had a beginning but you're you're an attribute you you came at a certain time and season that godhood ordained for you you were born into this world but then there come a time for you to be born again so that he could have fellowship with you you in a natural way in your father but he couldn't have fellowship with you brother Adam said until you came through the bedding ground and then was manifest in this life then he could have fellowship with you that's what brother branham said about the power to become sons he said what the purpose of God was and that was to have fellowship so he gave you the ability to be born again remember when Nicodemus come to him says how can a man be born again can he again enter into his mother's womb how can a man be born again see he liked the revelation of what Jesus was saying but Jesus was talking about this birth that takes place on the inside of man and he gave us the ability to be born again and he told them to go and tarry in Jerusalem until they were in dude with power from on high power that word power there means it's the Greek word Dunamis which you've heard many times it means the power or might the force to be but he gave you the ability to be born again he gave them ability to go to the upper room to receive that new birth your life Jesus came it says he came to his own and his own received him not but you know who did receiving the common folks received him readily the real it the religious soand souls of the day and they didn't receive him but the common people received him gladly and as many as came to him he gave the ability to be born again Oh hallelujah sealed away until the day of redemption you know I look forward to the day of complete redemption meaning when we received a body change I look forward to seeing my loved ones again look forward to seeing my dad again I look forward to seeing my grandfather again I look forward to seeing many of the fellow soldiers that have went on to be with the Lord see them again but you know who I want to see the most I want to see Jesus I look forward to meeting brother Branham but I want to see Jesus hallelujah because he's the one that gave me the power to become son of God hallelujah I wouldn't be anything without Jesus you wouldn't be nothing without Jesus all the accomplishments you could ever make in this life you know when I was years ago when I was in the army I made a lot of accomplishments I was good at being a soldier I learnt the army way and I was good at it and I received a lot of awards for it and I made a lot of accomplishments you know when it come down to it none of that meant anything and I was offered a lot more if I'd have stayed in but I felt this pull from God and though my mind told me the best thing for you to do is stay in and go ahead and take the promotion they're gonna give you but my heart told me something different I was willing to lay all those things down lay all those things aside you have had a point in your life where you had to make it just look Moses Moses / sook everything for Christ that's what the Prophet said he gave up all the treasures of Egypt to become God's man some years ago I was down in Sarasota Florida and I was with brother Danny steaming and we went out fishing we were on the bay out there and he started pointing out to me different houses that were along the coast there and in mansions they were actually not houses and he was pointing out these mansions to me and this one belong to so-and-so and this one belong to this famous person and this belonged to that famous person and I thought about what brother branham said he said they're having their millennium now we're looking forward to Armellini [Applause] turned me to Hebrews chapter 12 we read verse 5 through 17 Hebrews chapter 12 this is the chapter it starts off with with seeing that we're comes to Bob was such a great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us and let us run this race with patience that's how it begins but then in verse five it said you have forgotten the exhortation which speaking unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasing it and scourges every son whom he receiveth if he endure chastening then God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasing it not but if he be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you are bastards and not sons furthermore we've had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection to the father of spirits and live for verily for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening is for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceful fruit of righteousness under them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees make straight paths for your feet less that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow people peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord look diligently lest any man fail the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau or for one morsel of meat sold his birthright for we know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears there was no way for Esau to get the blessing after the blessing had already been given remember he saw says to to his father Isaac says blessed me also my father he says I can't I've gave the blessing to your brother I've made you his servant he cried but it was already done nothing could reverse it that's why he says he could find no place of repentance brother etem says and follow him he says job had not sinned he knew he hadn't sinned he had not sinned so he would not confess it because he absolutely hadn't sin but God was really trying him putting him to the test and I believe that every Christian that's born again has to go through those tests every son that cometh to God must first be chasing purge is that right if you cannot be stand chastisement of the Lord then you become a bastard or an illegitimate child you claim God to be your father and you know nothing of it a real true born-again child of God stands firm we are sold with an incorruptible seed of God it cannot perish see what I mean now if you got your ups and downs I would advise you to go to Dada and stay there until you really get born again when trials and troubles and heartaches and disappointments set in something holds it's not you holding there's something holding you see it isn't a question whether I hold on or not it's a question whether he held on or not it isn't looking at me it's looking at him he's the one something keeps holding me [Applause] hallelujah Jacob Jacob running from his brother feared for his life flees into another country then when he meets with God wrestles with an angel of God and he says bless me I'll not let you go do you bless me he was determined to get blessed by the angel you know what he got blessed with the power to become a prince the ability to become a prince that's what brother Branham said Paul lost all of his education all his theology God made him a missionary to the Gentiles Moses lost his ability become weak God made him powerful and sent him back to Egypt with a stick in his hand 80 years old not an army behind he were growing up there but in the power of the Spirit when you're weak then you're strong it's not in our strength or our power but it's his strength when works what does it mean when we are weak we are strong when we're trying to do it we're not we're not going to be able to we're not going to make it when we're trying to do it on our own of our own efforts but when we lead on him then we're strong then we overcome then we'll succeed Bentham says in a super sign he said this will be a sign God will be dwelling in flesh that was to attract the people for as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God and it's supposed to attract the evening light people when the light shows what attracted you to this message the evening light to think of how many are not attracted by it when you were in the world you may have had friends you may have thought they were good friends dear friends but when something began to pull on you on that inside and you were attracted that evening light then look what happened to them and I'm so thankful we come to the Lord and then we realized we got such a great big family amen hallelujah I just I enjoy seeing the love for one another when I was at Paul's graduation gathering and I was watching the different people I enjoyed the love that I saw coming from each one love for each other as just so wonderful you're the evening light people yeah that ought to that ought to give you something see when it said make your calling and election sure it didn't mean just prop it up but it mean make it steadfast another word give it a foundation an anchor something you can look back to he drew you look you young people you think well I'm here because mom and dad are here know you that God has been dealing with God is that that evening light is attracting you [Music] I think there were times in my ministry over the years that I kind of forgot I was so busy on saying what the prophets said I forgot to tell a new generation coming up that God sent a prophet I thought they would just get it God began to deal with me and I had to go back and bring in some teachings and things and show the scripturally God sent a prophet show how that John the Baptist was to fulfill to melikhaya 3 he was the fulfillment of turning the hearts of the father's back to the children as the scripture says remember the a the angel of the Lord came to Zacharias and he said he'll turn the hearts of the father's back to the children he stopped there but the rest of the scripture says that that spirit of Elijah was to turn the hearts of the children back to the father's that was fulfilled in the ministry of brother Branham I had to go back and bring teach these things just short scripturally I was talking to one of my daughters one time and I just thinking on these things in here she was in her late 20s and I said I asked her I said I know you believed that brother Branham was God's prophet but you know why we say that do you know it's scripturally she says no so I said oh then I'm gonna have to teach it because this generation needs to know and it's it's not bringing it emphases on the profit but you've got to realize God sent a profit so that you can hear what the Prophet had to say know that we need to hear it why because and it's not look the voice was not brother Branham for the random said I'm just the the mouthpiece that God uses but the voice was the voice of God hear ye him he can't live in yesterday's light you know I remember rolling up for a while down in another part of whoa hi oh and seeing the farmers raise their crops seeing the seasons as they changed you know they would plant wheat in the fall after harvest and everything they'd plant the wheat then it would come up it would look like green grass and then it would lay there all winter and the snow would come and be as an insulator over it in the freezing temperatures to have a good crop of wheat they needed to have snow for an insulation of the on the wheat and but the sun that shined in January though it was the same Sun that science shined in June but in June it was stronger and so brother Brahim said is the same son it's the same son but it's gotten closer it stronger the Sun is coming closer the in it's closer to its coming and it's crunch then the light is gotten is getting stronger and stronger you look at what we you they were following this message back in the 70s looking what you knew then now look at what the revelation you have today it has got stronger you understand more you look back at those times as a boy I didn't really understand anything and I thought I did what is it the sun's getting close to we're in it we're in a new light it's the same Sun but it's a greater light what happened to the ages of Lutheran Leslie they the people took and organized and they organized around the light of that day but as the light began to become greater they didn't move on with it I'm afraid there's a lot of people that are doing that today they're still living in a light of yesterday I'm gonna tell you something friends the light is stronger today than it was when brother Branham was here it's closer to the coming of the Sun it's greater think about it what good would the revelation do just stayed in one man one what God's purpose wasn't for one man to be the only one to hold the revelation that he was Sentinel in this endtime but he sent it through that man that you might have the revelation he said to his bride to the alert you're gonna be there because you say why because he knew you were gonna be there God knew it you know what he knew every prayer that would ever be prayed by his children don't worry about was not going to answer my prayer he's already answered it he knew your prayer before you prayed it just be patient everything comes in the right season everything comes at the right time God doesn't rush God never feels like I'm running out of time now I know there there is a supernatural being that does feel like they're running out of time that's the devil I'm running out of time I'm under a lot of pressure I got to bring more pressure but you know what is the pressure comes on you know what it does it just squeezes that little bride right on out of here how to look at you in the church age book bill around says hold this carefully in mind redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood Brooke bought back his own he bought back the spoken-word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog and turned into a sheep that's impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in specie as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice and hearing that voice would be aware of our Father calling and recognized that we are the sons of God we heard his voice hear ye him hallelujah he says hidden thinking man's filter but when you were born of the Spirit of God then you you are son of God when you always were a son of God and you always will be a son of God no weight is separated you have eternal life and eternal never did begin neither will it ever end speaking about Moses and why Christ speak he said now then see that he was born with the great gifts and quality within him and then it only taken something to flash across that to bring that thing to life see the seat of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world and when the light first strikes that seed it brings it to life but the light first has to come upon the seed I've taught many times of the little woman at the well in her in that condition though she be a ill-famed person though her life was degraded and she was in that condition because those traditions never touched her but when the light first trucker quickly she recognized because there was something in there to respond to it when the deep called to the deep there must be a deed somewhere to respond to it hallelujah are we doing tonight making our calling and election sure Alleluia the debate on tongues or the rim said I certainly don't want to be wrong and I'd better be right cause it's too late when I get there as the old brother said I don't want no trouble at the river so that's right it's going to be foggy morning then an awful time and I'm sure want my ticket in my hand it correctly signed because it's too late then you see for the random quoting this older brother saying I don't want no trouble at the river friends we're not going to have any trouble at the crossing I passed from this life I just go into the dimension to wait on everybody else I literally and if I'm alive and remain at the coming of the Lord then I'll see the dead in Christ rise first then I'll be changed in a moment in tweekly than I I believe that the prophets said we'd be here about a month or so after the resurrection but I don't believe the world will be able to see the dead in Christ I don't believe they'll be able to necessarily see you when you were changed I think about it often and I think well I'm not gonna have to worry about paying Dixon power you know The Electric Company I'm not gonna have to worry about the electric company or the water bill all those things will be passed from my mind I don't loo you I'm not gonna need my truck I'll be able to travel like I thought that was a question I had when I heard there were people that were believing in the return of brother Branham in some years and years back there was a brother that had a airplane waiting on him he was gonna fly him around from place to place I thought it'd be come back what in the world would he need an airplane for we don't need no airplane hallelujah Oh Stan Heavenly Father it's been good to been in your house tonight Lord I trust it what you laid on my heart I trust that I have tried to give it my best dear God Lord to where to deliver to the people of where they might be blessed and uplifted by it
