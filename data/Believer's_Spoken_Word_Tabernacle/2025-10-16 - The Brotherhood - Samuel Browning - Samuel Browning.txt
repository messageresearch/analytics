Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's a press, then there's an opposition, &gt;&gt; right? But greater is he that's in you &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram came to himself after the vision of going beyond the curtain of time. And he came to himself putting his fist in the air. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

I think that's such a to me I want to say God bless you. Amen. I know there's different ones that would have been here and sickness. Sometimes there's jobs and things like that, but God bless you. Amen. And just pressing your way out here tonight. And I believe God, amen, has something for us. He never calls us together without having something for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we just want to enter right in. Amen. What a wonderful atmosphere. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer. And Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, how we're so thankful, &gt;&gt; Lord, for what a wonderful presence, &gt;&gt; wonderful atmosphere, Lord God, as your children. Lord, we come Lord from all of the not only the walks of life but all of the different daily tasks and things that we've had before us but Father we've just stepped aside Lord your God to come and to worship you and Father to just Lord bask in your presence and to know that God that we Jesus can receive receive such strength from your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, such Lord such encouragement. Lord Jesus, we don't ask you Lord that you would take away the trials, the problems, but we ask you for the grace and wisdom and Lord for your leadership. Lord, that God that you would give us the grace to go through them. Lord, help us, Lord, just sometimes, Lord, in moments like this is just a moment that helps us, Lord, to &gt;&gt; Amen. just get right back on track maybe to look at things Lord in a Lord in the way that we should. Lord, we're not here because we're Lord a big I or big you. We're here Lord because of the grace of God. And Lord Jesus, unlike the spirit of this age, we're dependent on you, Father. &gt;&gt; You're our husband. Lord God, when you have taken us unto yourself, you've put that veil over your shoulder. &gt;&gt; That expresses that you would take care of all of our needs. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know the vastness of the needs that's here. It may not be, Lord God, very many of us, but it's still, Lord, if it's only just a couple, it's still, Father, we'll take you. And Lord, you won't withhold your presence. It's not about numbers with you, Father. It's about hearts that Lord would just welcome you and we're here tonight because we have need Lord of you. May you just come Lord and just cause the words of my mouth Lord to be formed that would be according to your will. Lord what is to be expressed here tonight and just minister to our hearts. Lord be with each and every one the different needs. Those that are not able to be here Lord may you minister to them as well. Lord, I pray and and make a way, Lord. If it's something that God, that we'd be hindering, Lord, may you make a way, Father, that they also, Lord, would be able to gather and and to assemble here as well, Father. Lord, what a privilege it is to be able to come together, Lord. We love you and we thank you, Father, in Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. Let's look here in the scriptures. Amen. John chapter 13. I'm going to read just a couple places and we'll allow you to have your seats tonight. Amen. Amen. So thankful for the just the Amen. the wonderful just the song service, the atmosphere. Amen. Just so precious. Amen. John 13 and 34. Amen. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another. Now, I don't believe these were just good words that were spoken. I don't believe this was something that was limited to Sunday school class, but he's speaking to his disciples, those that will be vessels that will actually pack the message. And if they miss this, they can have all the doctrine right, &gt;&gt; but if they miss this, &gt;&gt; then their identity is lost. &gt;&gt; Because we're not identified by how right we are in doctrine. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Doctrine is important. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Doctrine is important. The truth, the spirit of truth. That's very important. But notice what Jesus said. By this shall all men know or perceive that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another. Now, obviously, we're we wouldn't be outside of the word, but to be dwelling in the word is also to have the life of the word within us. And that is exactly what the perception where others would see. They wouldn't even it wouldn't even be about my did you see how they put that together. Did you see how they tied that scripture and tied that quote? My good. That's not it at all. But by this by the love not that we would even have toward them, but the love that we would have toward one another. Because after all this love when Jesus writes this speaks this a new commandment this could never have been attained to without the coming of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Impossible because this love that he's speaking of is who he is. &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Bram says the word is coming across our pathway and we're surrendering it to him. He said you are becoming love for God is love. So by this so I I to me I appreciate it because you realize it doesn't matter how smart we are. I believe in studying. I believe in giving ourselves to God. I believe in all of that. The Bible admonish uses in that. But when it all comes down to it what what is the distinguishing factor is the love of God within our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if you have love one to another. John 15:17, these things I command you that ye love one another. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I want to speak here tonight on this thought. The brotherhood. the brotherhood. And when you see the scriptures that we've read from here tonight, you recognize as Jesus many times you'll chase this down in the scriptures where it will say one of another, one to another. So it would speak of there would be a reciprocal part. In other words, for that love that would actually pass through of a reserved conduit and then it would actually be able to be received and passed on if like electricity flowing through this building. We we originally my wife and I at home I think of it as it comes to mind now. We've had a coffee pot. Many of you many different ones even when we lived at the other place many of you remember when we some 10 years ago and we were talking about how long we had had that bun coffee maker and you know when I drink coffee I like it boiling hot when I drink it I don't like it lukewarm and that's why I always tease the brothers from overseas when they say no ice and I quote the scripture I would thou hot or cold and then give it to them you know and I've got good friends uh buddies that I tell them I'll say you know what I'll go ahead and make your coffee and have it setting out so when you come here a couple months down the road, it'll be ready for you." And of course, they have their things they like to say about me drinking it scalding hot. But my point is is we we just got done talking about, "Yeah, we've had this coffee maker for 11 years." And you know, it's about the time you get ready to say something like that and something goes out. And so that very night when we made that statement, you know, we my wife and I where it's plugged in at cuz it always it stays warm, stays hot in that reservoir there. And she she actually that night it it got to a place kept kicking off that GFI switch. Well, I thought, my goodness, what in the world's going on? What's going on? And we kept on working with it. We went took it and plugged it in on another uh outlet so we could it would actually uh operate in a different part of our kitchen. And then so the next morning when I got up, I took that thing and I plugged it back in. Plugged it back in and it kept on popping that GFI. Popping that GFI. I would put that thing back in and reset it. And eventually I'd have to go downstairs. I I thought for a moment I thought, man, I'm going to have to call Brother Sean and and ask him to take a look at this here cuz I don't know what's going on, you know, and and I'm thinking, man, what am I going to do? I mean, how do you start a day without Jesus and coffee? I don't know how you do that, you know. But um at at any rate, we look at this and I found out when we got to looking at it online that actually what it was, it was showing that there had actually come a fault in that heating element. It had shorted. there was something that was wrong. I mean, you would say, "Duh, Brother Samuel, the GFI is kicking out." But sometimes you don't know. Is it the GFI switch that's wrong or is it the was it the coffee maker? Surely, I didn't think it was a coffee maker, but you know what it caused us to do? I took that thing and I then started plugging it in and plugging different things even into that outlet. And sure enough, we singled it down to that's what that is. And that's how it is within our lives. There's sometimes we we can't maybe figure out how is the current why is the current not flowing through my life the way that it ought to be because you know there's nothing wrong with with the love of God. There's nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost. You you're standing in that place to know that you've passed from death unto life. But maybe there's through the the the the circumstances of life through tests and through trials and and things have come up that sometimes there might have come a little bit of a short in your life and you realize that this is where you have to look at first because our lives was meant to be a channel. Jesus called us branches and a branch doesn't bear bear fruit of itself but it bears fruit of the vine. And so it's actually to be a channel that God would actually work through. And you know, God takes channels. God doesn't take channels like you and I or individuals that you and I would maybe so much look at. You know, we would have chose instead of Abraham and Sarah, while you know, if we were looking at bringing forth a promised son, we would have surely chose people who were actually able to accomplish that task. Surely, we wouldn't have chosen those that would have been barren and so forth. But God uses channels and he'll take the weaknesses and things that would be in our lives, even throughout of of the accumulation of things that's happened throughout our lives sometimes because there's not one of us that has come here through a perfect situation. We all have baggage. Baggage the prophet called it the grabag of life of things that we we have within that. And God in his grace knew all about that. And God would so pour in his life into our lives. And then we come into these moments. We come to these times where it absolutely takes us being able to surrender and to submit every one of our weaknesses in his presence. But you know, it's not just something and I want to just say it just maybe as easy as we would just say it as far as a switch. But it takes the right atmosphere in order to actually release fear from our life and be able to break it down to where that we actually feel at peace in his presence and to know that he already knows our weaknesses. He knows all of these things as the Bible tells us in Hebrews 4 that all things stand open or naked before him. He knows it already, but he's waiting on us to actually be be able to present whatever it might be. Whatever the weakness is, whatever the situation, God wants us to present it to him. And then he'll step right in and work right through our lives. That's exactly what he did when he took the disciples and asked them to look upon the field. Said they're white for harvest. He already knew what was needed as far as that there was needed laborers in the field. But he said, "Pray ye the Lord of harvest that he will send laborers into the vineyard." You see, many times this is where sometimes when we can look, there can be a disconnect. We hear the word being preached. My, how we're just so thankful to God. And and many times you begin to realize this and even as you grow in your walk with God that it's more than just a good service. Because a good service does not mean that it's the right kind of songs being played or my favorite songs or my favorite melody or my favorite preacher. It's not about that. when we can actually grow beyond those types of things and say, "Lord, I'm not here to come come to see a man. I might have my preferences just like you have your preferences, but I I don't want to I don't want to limit God to my preferences, but I want God to work in such a way. As a matter of fact, that's part of our growing. That's part of overcoming in our life to be able to actually overcome and go beyond our own human preferences and say, "Lord, you know what I need tonight?" And God can can take a gift that he's placed within a man's life, a person's life, and so speak through that that gift to you and I to where what we see is Jesus Christ. And the whole thing that we need to be able to see is what do we do after the service is over? What do we do after it's over? You know, after the after the the prayer of benediction and the song of take the name of Jesus is sung, that's not the time that actually the service ends. It's actually where God in a service has commissioned each and every one of us of the things that we would need to pray about in our own life. It always amazes me how God can take a service and we could all get together after the service and there's certain things you would get, certain things you would get, certain things you would get. How can that possibly be that that one man? Well, it's not one man. It's God himself. And as the word is being preached, you begin to find yourself garnering in to the spirit of God. And you begin to see things in a way that you have never saw things before. And just because we see it doesn't mean that it's going to come to pass in our life. It all begins with agreeing with the word, submitting to the word. But God also places it in our charge for us to actually pray about it. Many of the times there's things to where that there's things that maybe we don't pray like like we should. and ask God upon the things that he's speaking to our lives. Because every service, friends, should be a personally tailor fitted service that God has so fitted it for our needs. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we serve. &gt;&gt; So we don't show up to a service and say, "Man, I didn't need that service. I could have just stayed home tonight." But if we're really looking to see Jesus and we want to see him, that's what we want. We want to not only see him, I want to be more like him. So you don't want the ideas of Samuel Browning. You don't want the image of Samuel Browning because God don't want none of us to be like one another. He wants us to be like Christ. And so it should actually be Christ in one another that we long to see. Cuz after all as being the real attributes of God who we're actually fellowshipping with. It's not so much the flesh and blood, but it's the attributes of his spirit that are attribute sons and daughters of God. And that's why our fellowship is in the spirit. Because in the flesh, my we will let one another down. We'll disappoint one another. And God will allow that to be tested as he brings a body together. Why would God do that? He would allow that would be done in order to bring out more of himself in that of the perfection of his own life working through us. So this is the brotherhood. This scripture love one another. This is a it's a reciprocal word. In other words, what's being expressed, it should actually flow as a great conduit that like just like that electricity that I that I that I I spoke about when we got that new coffee pot. My got right on the way, ordered that new coffee pot, had it set up then the next day of the same same kind. And you know what? Everything working fine. Everything flowing. The current was flowing. Everything was just right. And you know what? God has to work. And he'll work in our lives because he knows there must be that reciprocal flow. His his love, in other words, when his love so comes into our life and flows into our life, it should not look any differently out of our lives as it did from his life. You might say, "Well, brother Samuel, he was God." But remember, he came down not only to be the blessing, but to share the blessing. And if he made a statement in the word and he would say that we are to love as I have loved you, then there's no way that we humanly can actually be able to attain to that outside of divine intervention. And it will take the divine love of God coming through and by the new birth. And it will actually take that word working in our life, the love of God. And let me just say it to you where you are tonight in your walk with God and even with the love of God in your life, you've not reached the climax. You've not reached the pinnacle because when that when that climax has been reached, the rapture goes. But all along through there is a growing. So don't allow the enemy to shame you, make you feel bad. When you're looking at the word and you say, "My, I need to pick it up right here. My I need to pick it up right there." That's a good sign as a sheep is following the shepherd and is absolutely recognizing that in this atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, he's not come to shame me, not come to condemn me, not come to put me down, but he's come here to encourage me that in the walk and to do what? That the his own life might come forth through our life. So this reciprocal, it's it's to be that same love that is to actually be working through the body of Christ. Now you might ask and say, "Well, brother Samuel, aren't we to express this love even to others that are not even apart and apart within that of the body?" Yes, but yet at the main same time, this is where the challenge is going to come. This is where the rubber will meet the road is when it actually comes down among your siblings, our family. Because you know, when you get among family, family has a way that everything sometimes can become common. We can see one another's shortcomings so well. We know one another's shortcomings. But this is why that God would even allow even and bring together a body of believers. Because you know why? There's not one body that is perfect. And there's not one person in that body that is perfect. But God has so assembled it in such a way that the love of God might triumph in each of our lives to so subdue our own humanity to the love of God dwelling on the inside. So to think of this how that even where it would be written you know beloved what manner of love is this that we should be called the sons of God. So God never called us sinners. He never called us pigs. He never called us goats. This message does not go around calling us that. But what the message tells us, you were always a son and daughter of God, but it calls us to recognize, don't allow that goaty nature to reign over your life no longer. Don't allow that pig nature to reign over your life no longer. You were called to a higher walk. And that higher walk is in Christ. And so this is where the love see God God's not in the business of shaming you because if he shames you to get you here, he'll have to shame you to keep you there. See, God doesn't bind his people to him by fear. False teachers do that. But God comes through his word and he will actually unite you with love and divine love. And that's what creates such a peace and an atmosphere that actually growth can take place within our life. Now when you think of it, it's it's like that as we said of of a family that where the family itself even within a father or a husband, you know, within the initiating to set the groundwork of what will actually be the home, how will the home actually be controlled, how will it be run, how will all of these things be done. And so God did not leave this up to anyone else to figure out, but he came himself. He was the example as I have loved you. And he was letting it be known that as I have loved you. Think about this. There was not a reciprocal that was going around because they could not actually be able to receive that of the agape love and turn around and project it right back to the Lord Jesus. Even when Peter was asked, "Do you love me?" He said, "Do you agape me?" He said, "I feel thee. Do you agape me? I feel thee." See, he was not able to express what God was calling for because he had not come to that place of complete death to himself, which that on the day of Pentecost would bring that part to where you had reached something entirely different about Peter. No longer do you find this about Peter. You don't find him living the same kind of life. What took place? The love of God moved in and took complete control over his life. Same thing about John. John who was ready to call fire down from out of heaven. What happened to John? John got in the presence of God and John was changed from death unto life. He received the impartation of God's own life and here it was the love of God that was moving through John's life. Now think about this that when we look at this within that of a family and how that God would so set the groundwork that truly the groundwork itself would be that of his spirit dwelling on the inside which is his love which also is his word. Now notice how Peter would write this. He said, "Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit." Now notice, obeying the truth through the spirit. So, so simply taking in of the truth actually brings purification. It will bring cleansing. Now, this is how far that that cleansing is to go. And notice how Peter when he even put this measure in his own as one an experience of his own life unto unfeigned love of the brethren. My so to come to that degree that you would say well brother Samuel the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost is to be able to receive the word for your day. I agree the prophet said genuine faith in the word of God. But remember you can't have faith without love. Perfect faith. Love produces faith. &gt;&gt; And faith is based on forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So notice how this would be wrote that you have taken the word of God in. And notice Peter would give this by the spirit of God. Here's a little bit of a measuring stick that you know cuz sometimes what it is, it's hard for us to see and measure our own selves. And sometimes depending on how you're made up, you can ever you can seem so so beneath and so below. And neither should we ever get up here as though we're we're something, you know, and my we've arrived. But yet at the same time, God doesn't want you to walk around, you know, with a frown and beat down either. He wants you to understand that your new birth is not your adoption, but your new birth only puts you in position to begin growing. God does not expect you to be perfect when the Holy Ghost has come. He expects the perfection of his life to work in you and bring forth perfection in your life. That's his achievement in our lives. So notice this. In obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeign love of the brethren, see that you love one another with a per a pure heart fervently. Notice that next part in there. See to it that you love one another with a pure heart fervently. So now this is a responsibility. It isn't just well you know here it is I I I've come to that place of un unfeign sincere sincere a real love for the brethren in my heart not just for the brothers that I like know that we want to get out of that filio realm we've have to reside down on the inside of that real true love for the brethren recognizing them as brethren part of the same family of God and to notice that we would have that responsibility to love see that you love one another with a pure your heart fervently. So, this is not something, this next part of the verse, I'm not going to dwell on this tonight, but that next part of the verse is not something that the Holy Ghost is just going to do for us. It will take him doing it, but it'll take us submitting to him and allowing him to come to the forefront, but the responsibility comes on us. It's kind of like in the tabernacle in the wilderness where God had different porters. Some were over that that of the meal. Some had to make that of the the the the oil of the apocryphe and all those things like that. they they themselves were responsible in order to see that the work of the tabernacle would go forward. What was needed would always be there. And that's the same way that God entrusts you and I. That's why he wrote in Jude, keep yourselves in the love of God. &gt;&gt; So what's entrusted? It's not just, well, I'm just here automatically. No, no. It It's something that we must keep guard and blinging oursel because constantly with this life and this world, it's constantly wanting to try to pull us out of the presence of God. &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about keeping you out of church. I'm talking about wanting to keep you out from God's presence. If he can do that even on, you know, on a daily, my here you are going along just a wonderful time during the day and all of a sudden if he can in any way just like in a service try to somehow get gloom over you or try to bring up your past or try to bring up something where you're a failure and you entertain that for a moment. I don't have to tell you. You know what happens because that's not just a thought. That's a spirit that's trying to anoint you with doubt. You say, "Well, I don't doubt God's word." But when you're entertaining that against the word that said, "My little children, sin, let's sin not." But if we sin, we have an advocate with Jesus Christ, the righteous. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us. I am not going to doubt his word. I've stood on that word and when I've confessed that sin from my heart, whatever it is, shortcoming, it has dropped in the blood of Jesus Christ and God don't remember it no more. But you see, why would Satan want to do that and try to anoint you with that unbelief? Why would he want to do it in that way? Because as soon as you begin to entertain that, then immediately it's like breaking of the channel when you entertain that and you are called to be a channel. You're not called to produce the word. You're not called to produce works. You're not called to make things happen. We are called to be channels that are available for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my my. So notice in the scripture where it says if that same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you, it shall also quicken your mortal body. So however this life it worked in him, it will make our mortal body come to the same expression. &gt;&gt; I want to remind you when you got the Holy Ghost, it wasn't your spirit that died. It wasn't your body that died. &gt;&gt; It was your soul. &gt;&gt; It was a nature. &gt;&gt; And God, when the Holy Spirit has come into your life, then what? Then here you have out of three parts of your life, body, spirit, and soul, onethird of you is redeemed and twothirds are not. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And this is why that we can never treat the other twothirds as though they're redeemed. their possessions. &gt;&gt; You bring it in subjection by the authority of the Christ of God in your hearts. &gt;&gt; Now notice within this, as it would state within the scripture, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Now watch how John would write this in 1 John chapter 3. We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love &gt;&gt; the brethren. &gt;&gt; I want to be very specific here. He didn't say because we love everybody. &gt;&gt; This is a love just like within your home. You love your children. Now, I'm just going to tell you, if you love everybody else's children better than your own children, you got a problem. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have problems in your own home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it should be that God has so channeled and given you those children, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, well, this one over here, I I don't have a problem with taking them and showing them how to do things on the lawnmower and this and that. Right. God didn't give you that other person to do that, too. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Maybe as your children pass on through, but God entrusted and gave you those children to you and that love is to be poured out upon them. Now, I know we spoil them and everything else, but the reality is is love also has a lot of correction in it, too. And correction doesn't always mean the belt or the rod or all that of chasing. But correction can actually be the expression of showing what's the right thing to do and living the what is what is the right way to live. So even within this when we consider this this standard that would be set forth of how that we know we've passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. I wonder I wonder how many John when John would write this right here. Remember this is the same one that was ready to call fire down from Samaria. Now he had quotes on this. &gt;&gt; You see before the Holy Ghost came, he loved quote wars. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Samuel. &gt;&gt; You see, that was a clear sign that even when Jesus, cuz the Holy Ghost couldn't have come yet, but Jesus even told him, you don't even know what spirit you're of. If you're wanting to destroy somebody, whether it's online or whatever more, that's a wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; And listen, friends, we already have enough against us. &gt;&gt; I don't care how wrong a man is, we are never anointed by the spirit of God to tear down one another. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you what that is. That's called a selfish spirit. &gt;&gt; It's called a critical spirit. And the only way that a person can ever get in that place because they're not dwelling down in the camp with a pillar of fire. They're up there on the fundamental altars of Balum. &gt;&gt; Got to be careful how how fundamental you become. You want to be fundamental, but you want to be fundamental with the spirit of God in your life. Because with the spirit of God in your life, you can look and thank God for his grace and hold that same grace for somebody else and know that his grace is sufficient just as it is for you. And that's where we want to dwell is the pillar of fire. We don't want to get up here on the high places where you can look down and all you see is hind departs. If all you're seeing is hinder your parts, well, brother Sam, all I see is faults. All I see is failures. You're not dwelling in the camp of the supernatural like you ought to be. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's preachers. I don't care who it is. If you're not dwelling in the camp of the supernatural, you know, I'm preaching Bible to you. I'm preaching the message right there where the pillar of fire, right in the midst of the camp when God was right there. Sure, we've got problems. Sure, there's situations. But when we're dwelling where we ought to be, then we can recognize God's grace for one another just as it is for us. What is it? It's reciprocal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's reciprocal. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; Wow. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. &gt;&gt; Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. &gt;&gt; And ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. &gt;&gt; Remember brother would tell us over and over, you don't have to be a murderer with an actual knife &gt;&gt; to destroy somebody. &gt;&gt; You can tear down their character. &gt;&gt; So good. Well, brother Samuel, they're wrong. Listen, let me just say this to you. If they're wrong and you go and begin to knife their character, what if God uses that channel to help one of your children &gt;&gt; or would desire to do that? &gt;&gt; But what's been happened is that confidence and respect has been diminished. &gt;&gt; That's where it becomes a responsibility. I'll tell you if there's anything at all if we got any grievances. Oh, brother Sam, I got grievances. Well, the place to put grievances is not out on the internet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's actually not to call one another and give one another grievances. I'll tell you a place to go, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; is to the Lord in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what real brotherly love will do is the prophet said, you begin to put yourself in his shoes. &gt;&gt; True. I say, "Lord Jesus, help us sir." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Notice this. Hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for our buddies at work for our natural gene pool. Brother, you're saying I'm not to love my family. I'll tell you what he said right here. Lay down our lives for the brethren. But sometimes we're willing to lay down our own lives more for our flesh and blood than we are for the family of God. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes that laying down sometimes it can come through compromising. Sometimes it can come, oh, we'll go to great lengths for our natural family. I'm not saying that we shouldn't have a love and a care for our family, but neither should listen to me. Our love and our care for our family infringe upon our God-given rights. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just going to help my family out. Brother, I won't be able to be there for months on end because I'm going to help them out. &gt;&gt; You I'm not the principal. you don't have to give me a tardy slip or an exemption that you got to take that up before God. &gt;&gt; But I think there's some things we have to really evaluate. But if we're not careful, we'll lay down given things. And if we're not careful, it only begins right there. Reason on this, reason on that, reason on that, and where we at? We're living outside of our God-given ground. We're living right out here in this realm of the twothirds that's unredeemed. &gt;&gt; And we've got reasoning for it. We've got we can go right in the scriptures, you know, in James. But yet, it's it's amazing that the scripture itself, one scripture should interpret another scripture, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a word that it's a simple word. It has two letters. It's no. &gt;&gt; Over the years, sometimes in counseling where I've had to tell different ones. You know, sometimes what it is is sometimes there's individuals that I begin to realize over the years with pastoring that what it is, it isn't necessarily so much that they want to help people. It's that they have a need or an issue in their life they've never dealt with. Maybe they've been rejected or never appreciated in the right way. So, they're always reaching out to want to try to do things. And in yet, it's really not from the genuiness of really wanting to do it. It's about to try to satisfy. Listen, friends, I'm not putting anybody down. I think one of the things we want to look at is let the word examine our lives. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because if not, you see how the enemy plays upon those things in our life. He'll take things that have been complexes, the things right there. I'll never forget when going through, you know, to many times when I've talked with different things. It can be situations and all of a sudden here I am in the middle of counseling and when and the presence of God comes down and something is uncovered that happened years and years and years ago. And that person said, "Oh my goodness, this happened here, here, and here." And they begin to realize what these things is still having an effect on their life, on what they're taking on. And then they can almost feel guilty if they say, "I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I just can't do that." &gt;&gt; That's good. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that we can take things to God in prayer. &gt;&gt; I I just you you know me well enough by now right now. I've never told anybody don't do this and you do this and you do that. I'm not If you come to me for that, save your time. I'm not tell I'm not here to tell you what to do. But if God will allow me, I will ask you questions that I don't want answers to, but I want you to think about those questions. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you pray about those questions? Because these are questions that if God gives those questions, it's for us to reflect and decisions and choices must be made by us as individuals. How in the world did I get here? &gt;&gt; But who so hath this world's goods and seeth his brother have need, and shutth up his boughels of compassion from him, how dwelleth, now watch this. This is key word because John will write of the love of God not as something that comes and goes &gt;&gt; because you see the real outpouring of the Holy Ghost is not something that just falls upon our spirit and then it pulls back. That's not the coming of the Holy Ghost. Sure, the rain falls on the just and unjust, but the coming of the Holy Spirit according to the word and the word alone will lead and bring forth a new birth to every predestinated seed that receives the word of God down into their soul. And it will no longer be it will not just be something coming and something leaving, but it will actually God takes up his abode. He abides. He dwelleth in our life. And that is even when we don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; He's abiding still cuz he said, "Lo, I'm with you always." &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; And so he teaches us even in our beginnings of our walk with him as a faithful father not to depend on our feelings. Now some some of us maybe how we're made up, you know, we're maybe been made to rely upon our feelings. We've lived by our feelings so long. So it isn't just something when the Holy Ghost has come there's a light switch and we're no longer living by our feelings. As a matter of fact, we've got to continue to battle against our feelings cuz no doubt some of us did not feel like being here tonight, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Some of us didn't feel like certain things. You're not saying, "Man, I know it's truth." Cuz sometimes with the pressures and circumstances, it would have been more comfortable to have been at home. But you see, even right here, in that simple way, you have had to bring your feelings, no matter how real they were, in subjection to the word of God. That's the same way when our feelings get out of line with one another. Same way when our feelings get out of line with our husband or our wife or our children, we've got to bring them back in subjection. You know why? If you don't do that, you are not a fit channel for the Holy Spirit to move through. And he will not do that. I probably won't get to those quotes tonight. I could tell by time. But you know, look at this. Dwelleth the love of God in him. How dwelleth it? So he sees a need and shutth up his bows. You know, sometimes it isn't that we've missed the needs. Let me read the last scripture. My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. How many of you thankful that God became one of us? &gt;&gt; About five of us. How many of you thankful that he went to Calvary, &gt;&gt; shed his blood, &gt;&gt; right? Thankful he got up on that Easter morning. &gt;&gt; Thankful he sent back the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, what was that? Was that just a word? &gt;&gt; Was that just a I love you. &gt;&gt; What was that? It was him. &gt;&gt; He saw the need in our lives. &gt;&gt; Jesus was observant of others. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He even the others. This was not even anything spiritual. They're hungry. &gt;&gt; We need to provide something for them. &gt;&gt; They've come to this meeting. &gt;&gt; Now, what if Jesus would have, you know, played the spiritual route? Well, we're here for spiritual food and due season. &gt;&gt; What does it matter about the natural food that perishes anyhow? Sometimes those statements are made because of mothballs in the wallet. That's good. Sometimes those statements are made out of those things. They're not made out of a spiritual part, though we'll try to cover it up with quotes and everything else. But listen, friends, we're not fooling anybody, even our own selves within it. So notice to see to see a need. I I think in this hour, if Jesus was that observant, it was not because he had some spectacular DNA. Remember, he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. He had to go through the same things that you and I go through. He is a faithful and merciful high priest, deity of Jesus Christ. One of the many places Jesus was tempted with sexual temptation, tempted by women, tempted with drinking, tempted with all these things, but yet he remained and he was able to be able to resist temptation. He felt the pull to give in to the easier way with through the midst of temptation. But in order to be the right kind of a mediator and then the sacrifice for you and I, he withtood that temptation that then with the coming of the Holy Spirit, he might be the right kind of a mediator through you and I where we can go to him and say, "Lord, I know it's not like they're spitting on me, but I feel like spit is on me, Lord. I I Lord, how that is and they're not pulling things a beard out of out of my chin, but I feel like it, Lord. I feel like they're pulling virtue. I feel like they're pulling this, but Lord, I need strength, Lord. I need help, Lord God. And you know what's happening during that time? It is you and I being melded down and the very love of God on the inside that will allow itself to become expressed in our lives through divine opportunities that have been orchestrated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By God. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's great. Yes, sir. So sometimes this very simple thing right here, this scripture, I know probably reading this scripture right here, I probably could have just put a big dollar sign right there cuz some think that's how we help one another, but that's not limited to that. I know it's very, very simple. You know, Brother Brandham's mother, I'm just going to go with as it comes. You know, Brother Brham's mother, Brother Brandham tells us when he sits there and how when brother Neville came in to see his mother, he said, "You know what?" He said, "I've visited many sick folk and I've done that." He said, "But I never knew how much it meant until when I seen brother Neville &gt;&gt; and then I seen some of you saints &gt;&gt; come and visit." &gt;&gt; Then brother Brandon will take up in the beginning of the message indictment. Remember talking about Edith? Edith Wright's going through a great time in her life. She's actually passing through the change and the time of life. Brother Brandham takes a little bit and expounds on those changes within our life. And he says, "Look," he said, "It it'd be good for you if if different ones of you, not all at once now, &gt;&gt; but little by little, go out and visit her. &gt;&gt; And don't tell her she looks bad. Tell her she looks good." &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, I I'm in for the deep things. These are the deep things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz if we've got all the doctrine right and we don't have this part right here, we're still lacking. &gt;&gt; So how can even some of the things be expressed? Well, you know what? I've watched sometimes some things also checked seen responses and things sometimes. You know, I can remember that even some years ago and it doesn't have to rely upon just one person to be the ring leader to get meals together. Oh, this sister so and so. If you've got a burden on your heart, you do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Get it together. you allow those things to be done because listen, there's no one greater, no greater one among us here than another. And I think of it when different ones of us have been sick. I know you think, brother Samuel, you're going awful carnal on this tonight. I'm just trying to show you of a different way sometimes where things can be attended to to help out the body. And I know we might look at and say, "Well, I don't need this or or they don't need that. They're they're wealthy and they don't need this or they don't need that." It isn't that they need money. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They might be millionaires, &gt;&gt; but what they need is to see the expression of Jesus Christ through the brotherhood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so it's not always money. That's why when you think about having relationship with your children, it ain't all about money, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You don't have to have money &gt;&gt; to have relationship. Take them here, take them there. You could have all the money in the world. You could take them to Disney World. You could take them here, take them there, and still not have relationship. &gt;&gt; That's true. That's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; It's not about money. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It's with love. And God teaches us how to submit and how to do what's important and minister to that one. &gt;&gt; Everyone, as I've said before, even our boys, you know this within your family, you got multiple children. Everyone's different. You also know even in the approach to it certain times, right? You might have the greatest plans in the world. Maybe it's your wife, your husband. You got the greatest plans in the world. My, you got everything lined up and all of a sudden, where' these cats and dogs start raining from? And you know what it does? Let's just be honest. It gets under our skin. &gt;&gt; You know why? Ain't going as we had it planned. That's okay. I'll say I'll preach and say amen for you because there things is just not going as it's planned. But you know what? God God knows exactly what he's doing. And through all of these things, even as we work with one another, it isn't Let me just tell you something, friends. There's no such thing as, "Oh, this was a problem in church." Or, "Oh, I tell you, I've got this going on at home or this with my children." Listen, let me just tell you something. Those types of things like that are not, "Oh, if I could just get this out of the way." No. God uses these very circumstances. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That are pulling on our strings that we would like to just open the door and get them out. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, lay hands on me. &gt;&gt; Lay hands on me tonight. Brother Samuel, speak the word over me. Oh God. Lord, let it come tonight, Lord. And and just Lord Jesus, just turn her heart completely. Turn his heart completely. And &gt;&gt; don't we? &gt;&gt; That's right. Sometimes the way very ways that we're praying about for change and God is saying, "No, you're going to be my hands." &gt;&gt; You're going to be my feet. &gt;&gt; And in order to be my hands or my feet, you're going to have to change your thoughts about this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Remember, the feet of William Brandham became the feet of the Holy Ghost that night in Oregon. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham had to change his thoughts how he was thinking about that man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So then to see these things how God will allow sometimes friends listen it isn't just even in the preparation of foods and we get in those things and and build that all up and and you're doing that you know you know what that says when you you you you you do something like that for somebody else even right here in the body you know what that says that expresses love it expresses care that you're more than just somebody that I think I know your name I think you go to church yeah you go you're yep yep you're you're in my church yep you're on the directory it's more than at &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I'm tired. The prophet, let me just give you this words. When he showed up at his house and all that chaos was going on, &gt;&gt; here's brother Ram's exact words in one of the quotes. He said, I was tired. &gt;&gt; He had had people walking through the house all day. I've got a word from the Lord, thus sayith the Lord, if you don't listen to me and this and this and this and that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon had all that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He called it mental cases. He had that going on in the house. Then plus on top of all of the other spirits being cast out of sicknesses and whatever more. Think about what kind of a turmoil that would be in the home. &gt;&gt; Cuz after all, they didn't have a 3,000 foot home. &gt;&gt; It wasn't even they didn't even have the add-on at that time that you can drive by and see right now on the house. &gt;&gt; Didn't have that. And here all of this is actually going through. As a matter of fact, Brother George told me it was a very, very small house that they lived in originally. I mean, it was unbelievably how small it was. I think it was, you know, it might have been a little bit bigger here than the platform, but think about all of that was going on within there. Well, it made no wonder that anybody would be crazy. But brother Brandham here, he steps in. He says, "I'm tired, but Lord, what would you have me to be in this situation?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, this is how I'm going to do it. No, he said, "What would you have me be, sir, &gt;&gt; in this situation?" Because every situation's different. &gt;&gt; I'm sure every one of us, you've tried to replicate He's honest. &gt;&gt; The rest of us is honest, too. I say, "Amen." Try to replicate and you begin to realize and God brings you to certain times. I remember that even working with kids. God taught me that right there. You can't replicate those things. &gt;&gt; God will have things that just blow up your replication. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God wants us depending on his leading. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It always is. Lord, what would you have me to be in this situation? &gt;&gt; Sometimes it isn't even that of of food. But I'm I just say it to you like this tonight. When there's different ones, it should not be in this hour that we don't know. Oh, who's sick among us? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, really? Oh, really? So and so had surgery? &gt;&gt; How can that be missed? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We not only have an app, we have email, have all the other communications that are going on. Listen friends, you might think this is carnal, but it's not whatsoever. &gt;&gt; These are very things right here. He who seeth his brethren need, but you see where everything is at in this hour, this life that we're living in, it's a time, listen, the pressures are greater than they ever were. That's a sign of the oncoming Exodus. &gt;&gt; The pressures are not are not are not lessened. Many of you have more responsibilities than you ever had, right? It's like how you know you know when to be able you you walk away from your desk or whatever it is and you realize you never come into a spot of where everything is cleaned off and it's orderly. You just recognize when to walk away from work and say this is enough. It'll be here tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And for some of us that's overcoming in our own makeup. &gt;&gt; Right? And God's working through that. See, we can look at think, oh my, this this but God's working even out his will through our own lives just to trust him and knowing when to just even step back. But to think that within this Satan's desire is to so overwhelm our lives. Listen friends, he knows in this hour that what this message is called to produce is brotherly love. If it does not produce that, the capstone cannot come down. But it will produce that. That's what this will do. Remember the honey that was poured in the rock box and the prophet was was spoken it will stick. What was he saying? That the same water that has went through the rock box and has sealed each one down through the ages where their faith has become a supernatural faith. That honey being poured in by the messenger in that rock box, it will move and it will hold. What will it hold? It will hold a bride together. It will bring the very resurrection of the dead by the working of the supernatural in our life because they without us &gt;&gt; should not be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The achievement in an age, we're not just talking about hate. If we're talking about becoming love, we see in this age &gt;&gt; the personification of hatred. &gt;&gt; That's right. People shoot people they don't even know. &gt;&gt; They disagree with them. You see where we're at in this hour &gt;&gt; over the time it's already been all the way down through the age. Remember it's coming into such a place within this hour. These demon spirits people don't even know what they're doing. That's why listen I don't I don't feel bad at the person. It's what it is is that they're overtaken with spirits. &gt;&gt; Think about it. If you could go and talk to many of these people who are on death row and other things else then look they don't even realize what took hold of them. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a spirit that took hold of them. That's the same way it was in the days of Noah. The earth was filled with violence through them. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just violence out here. There was channels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Channels that absolutely accepted those thoughts, &gt;&gt; those demonic anointing and got them people in such a case of ready for destruction by getting in the spirit of destruction. And the prophet said, if there if the world as it is now getting in the spirit of destruction, then God is also here to bring his people into the spirit of rapture of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So to think of this, it's not something that when we cons when we consider what would be the perception how he laid down his life. Who did he go to Calvary for? Who did Jesus go to Calvary for? Did he need to pay for his own sins? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. He had no sin. He had nothing to repent of. &gt;&gt; When he walked into the water to be washed, he didn't have to walk in there for repentance. &gt;&gt; He was he was the lamb that was to be washed. Also, the high priest that was to be washed and later anointed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, he did none of this for himself. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said who for the joy that was set before him. What was that joy right here tonight? that he would be able to see you in your right mind, me in my right mind, to be able to be free from the hold of drugs and pornography and all these other things. He would be able to see the joy where there's such a love of God in your heart for him and for his word. He did that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That he might bring to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What he knew lay within you because it was part of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That lays within you. That's &gt;&gt; right. You were always part of this family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were like one of those long lost people. Found it. One of the men one time he's a didn't even realize who he was tied into. He loved this Navajo music playing the flutes and playing the music. Then he realized it. New Jersey. Finally one day everything gets traced down and realizes he's Navajo. the very things that he liked all of his life, it was something that was in him. I've also watched I've just studied over the years at different times when these things will come across I just put them in separate studies and categories and look at them. You look at certain things and sometimes it can be so traumatic. You find with on individuals that when they find out that where where they are at and oh this is you know really not you know maybe they like one one particular young lady she was actually stolen from the hospital by a nurse but yet actually raised as though she was her own and then when she finds out she's not it's was devastating to her. I want you to understand that real in real reality, you and I, I don't care if you were raised by natural parents or not. I'm whether it was grandparents or whatever more. Let me just tell you, you had a heavenly parent &gt;&gt; that never ever lost sight of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what you would be swn in. Knew exactly all of the complexities of life. He knew all the mistakes. So, let me just tell you something. Don't try to go back and, oh, if I could have lived, if I could have redone this, if I could have redone that. You can't redo it. But what you can do is go forward from today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is grace right here tonight to make a decision to where you're not dwelling back there. That's a trick and a trap of the enemy to get you to reminisce down memory lane. But allow God's grace to be so great and poured into your life. Allow him to express the laying down of his life. He knew how low you and I would be. And he went lower than where we were &gt;&gt; that he might lift us &gt;&gt; to where he is. &gt;&gt; The truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Man, the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just read this first little part and I'm I'm just going to close. I want you to think about this. The first thing that Pentecost produced. Many times when we think of that term of Pentecost, we think of great dynamics of power. And it is. It's God's. It's God's power. &gt;&gt; It was due, right? That which is able to blow up open the channels. What's been clogged up in our life, it's able to to free us. That's exactly right. We we needed that in our lives. We needed that joy. We needed that liberty, &gt;&gt; that that jubilee, that part that brings us back to who we are. But the very first thing that Pentecost produced after the coming of the Holy Spirit, the very first thing that the Holy Spirit produced was that of brotherhood, &gt;&gt; divine love. Let me read the first little part of this. The first thing that Pentecost produced, in other words, was a product of it was brotherly love. This is why that a person can can never be able to say, "Well, I really I tell you what, I so love this message and can't get along with anybody." &gt;&gt; You might agree with the truth. And to be able to say, "I believe it." Remember the prophet says that only shows you can read, &gt;&gt; right? But you've got to have the token, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because the token is the life of the covenant. That's what makes the word live. That's the love of God from our hearts. Not to know him, not to know the word is life, but to know him, &gt;&gt; the author. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. It tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a brotherhood. to such a way that they had everything in common in the Bible days of brotherhood. Now they were as different as night was from day. Listen friends, before the Holy Ghost came, they were here spatting, even walking behind the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Who's going to be the greatest? &gt;&gt; What was that that came among them? spirit &gt;&gt; started comparing themselves to one another. God don't want you comparing yourself to one another. &gt;&gt; That's that's the greatest downfall. We're not to compare where we compare ourselves is with the word. It's it's incredible how Satan will use this. He'll use comparison to cause people to elevate. Oh, I feel pretty good. I tell you, not like some people in the church. Not like this one. There's a scripture that says, "God, I thank you that I'm not like that publican." &gt;&gt; Better be careful. &gt;&gt; I don't care because that publican, they might only be in justification, but God might be waiting to temper you. And the love of God expressed through your life because life comes through the body, right? Hello. &gt;&gt; Seeing that there's a need maybe with a a sister or a brother. Well, I'll just wait and let let brother Samuel do it. And it's true that brother Samuel can go. But I want you to understand, I'm only one person. &gt;&gt; Understand, I'm not here tonight with a table and signing up like for the army. I'm just trying to tell you is that don't underestimate what God has done in your life. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a walking quote book. &gt;&gt; That's right. You don't even have to be a walking a walking Bible as far as as you can quote every scripture. I listen I understand study to show thyself approved. But sometimes sometimes people need somebody &gt;&gt; with God with skin on it &gt;&gt; to be a friend to help them during their journey. Think back how it was with your life. &gt;&gt; Think back how it was some of the different ones when you came to the Lord. Think about how it was I know certain sometimes our our minds need to be recalled to these things. I I know I'm closing. I'm closing. Our minds need to be recalled to remember these things because sometimes we get over here and we forgot how we got here. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, then we turn around and are looking at everybody else and saying, "Well, glory to God. What in the world's wrong with them?" Have you forgot &gt;&gt; what God did for you? &gt;&gt; That there were others who you know what took you under their wing? &gt;&gt; That's right. And they didn't run your nose in the dirt. They didn't, you know, berate you. &gt;&gt; They expressed Christ to you. &gt;&gt; My my Can we go another couple hours? Let's stand. A brotherhood. Say, "May God help us." May God help us. &gt;&gt; Am I my brother's keeper? &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Where's Abel at? How should I know? How should I know? See, sometimes it isn't just even about that. What about your wife, your husband, your son, your daughter? What? How? What about a brother? What about a sister? And sometimes I wonder I wonder. We're not asking I'm not asking you to come around and be prophetic. We're under a prophetic word. But God's not God's not asked you and I to operate as a prophet. He don't want me to be a prophet as a pastor. If he wanted that, he'd have made me that. Sure. &gt;&gt; So, as a pastor, the only way that I can operate is, oh, sure, there's things that God will show me from time to time and things that he he'll want me to see. But, you know, as a pastor, a pastor is the ox of the team. And you know what an ox, he's got, oh, it's four feet on the ground. &gt;&gt; So, whatever's been told me that's in the heavenly, I should see it on the earth. &gt;&gt; If if the heavenly what's said in the heavenly, it's not matching up on earth, something's wrong. something's wrong. And so this is where that as a pastor, God would use that and operate even within the pastor to minister within these different things. But God's not asked us to have discernment. Oh, I see so and so's getting a little cold. I see so Look, you might have that feeling on your heart. And you know what? If that comes to your heart for that person, go to them. Hello, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to him. Well, brother Sam, my life's too busy. You know what you're missing? You're missing a part of the divine expression. &gt;&gt; H how is the word going to be expressed through your life? Well, I just come to the house of God and man, I just feed on the word. But where's the expression? How is it expressed? If we're not careful, we become fat and sassy in the stalls and there's no expression in our lives. &gt;&gt; But you see, part of that expression in our life, that's part of your old growth. It's part of your overcoming. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you what, I could be I can be real brotherly with this with this brother right here. He's a good buddy. He's a good chum. But maybe that's not the one that God's showing you that's in need. Amen. I pray God forgive us. &gt;&gt; If we have to turn around and say, "What happened to so and so? What happened to brother and sister so and so? What happened to them? Well, why didn't brother Samuel make an announcement?" I wonder if even beginning here tonight, we could say, "God, help me to get out of my own world." &gt;&gt; Help me to get out of my own world. &gt;&gt; See, we're not, if we're not careful, it becomes very so easily about self. &gt;&gt; And we've got certain thoughts about self that somehow it exempts us. And that's not me. But God, he knows in our lives &gt;&gt; and he brings us into that. Lord, help me to be as observant as you were, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me not to be consumed. I know we're we're burdened. I I I told you that we're burdened. Seems like we've got things more and the pressures and of this life and certain things. I agree. Probably you're the same way. I've got reminders on my phone of things to do this particular day. Matter of fact, I've got added some reminders that I've continued to two months down the road because it goes to this week, then this week, then this week, then this week, then this week because it's not really things that's maybe altogether pressing, but it's just all of a sudden with the toils of the day and you start looking at that and you're like, that can wait till tomorrow. Soon as we put it off to tomorrow and put over here and can I also say this? I'm I'm not going to keep you. Why don't we just allow the enemy to take any excuse from our lives or ask God to take it? Well, I'm not that good with people. I'm not that good here. I I fumble with words. I Why don't you say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; I'm here. &gt;&gt; What you want me to be in this situation?" &gt;&gt; What do you want me to be? see the words to be expressed through our lives. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's the simplest of things like this here tonight. I know we didn't really get maybe so far as what I have in my notes, but I believe God spoke to our hearts to challenge our lives. You know, I would say it like this as we get ready to pray. Brother Bram comes to the end of recognizing your day in its message. I I love Brother Bram's humility. I love Brother Bram's transparency. I love how Brother Bram just does not say, "I've got it." But I love how he says it at the right end of recognizing your day in its message. When he's praying, he said, 'Oh God, let me be the revival. &gt;&gt; Create in me the revival. Create in me what's lacking, Lord. Make me to hunger. Make me to thirst. Create in me what's lacking. Make me more kinder. Make me more humbler. Make me more willing. Make me more of a servant. I say, "Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord." That's what I want more of the Holy Ghost for. &gt;&gt; I want more of the Holy Ghost. I don't want more of the Holy Ghost to make me feel good. &gt;&gt; Make me feel like a son and daughter of God. I I I'm I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; You're a son or a daughter of God. But what I want is is I want to be more like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. and being more like him is Lord I don't want my mind anointed but anoint me &gt;&gt; to express &gt;&gt; you through my life &gt;&gt; you loving tonight &gt;&gt; let's pray heavenly father &gt;&gt; you've been so gracious to us tonight Lord you know Lord each and every one of our needs Lord God every one of us not just those of us that are here Lord I've included myself right here tonight, Lord. Dear God, as we look in upon your word, we don't want to miss that part of an expression. Oh, I know where to be a a witness. That's true. To the outside world. That's true. But what would it be like, Lord, in our homes if there was no care &gt;&gt; one for another? Oh Lord, it would be an awful cold, cold place. What would it be like, Lord, for parents that don't know what their children are doing? Teenagers, whatever. I don't know. They're up in their room. I don't know what they're doing. What would What kind of home would that be? But allow things, Lord, to accumulate sometimes things to build up and and then yet in the mind is apparent. Everything's good. Everything's okay. But Lord God, how we want to so emulate you, Lord. We want to reflect you. Lord, &gt;&gt; it was in the evening time when you would come down and gather your children, ask them how their day had been. begin to express your love to them, Lord. Father, just like we heard last last week through brother Marcus, Lord, as you took your servant, &gt;&gt; that's what you've done through the message. You've showed us what real fatherhood is, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Husbands, so forth. But what would it be, Lord, if our lives, our homes were in that way? Lord, I know tonight that even if there is a home or homes that would say, "Oh, mine's mine's that way." But Lord God, may I pray tonight the grace of God is not here to condemn. But may Lord God, as they can look up to you to know that you're a restorer, that dear God, that you will take through the through the channel of their lives. It won't be, Lord God, of passing through a prayer line. We believe in them, Lord. I've stood over and over. I believe in praying, Lord God. I've stood many times, Lord, within a meeting and prayed for need after need after need after need. And we need that. But sometimes, Lord, the prayers within there, I think, as I've spoke with different ones and just been one-on-one with them, Lord God, and help them to see so they'd have the right expectation to where the enemy would just be drove back, Lord, from condemning them and beating them up, Lord, to where they could actually begin to look up like a son and daughter of God. And to know that, God, that you're going to use their hands, [Music] freeing them, Lord God, from that of guilt and other things in their life. and and you're going to use their lives. Oh God, that's the real miracle. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us, Lord. Lord God, I want to freshly &gt;&gt; surrender &gt;&gt; my life to you, Lord. Freshly these hands, these feet, these lips, this mind, this heart. Lord God, every gate of my spirit, Lord, grant it, Lord Jesus. Lord God, I pray, Father, for each and every one of us that are gathered here tonight. Lord God, help us. &gt;&gt; May you deliver us, Lord. Not just those that are gathered here, but Lord, this entire assembly. Oh God, it will take you to deliver us from our own little worlds. God, we don't want our own little worlds. [Music] &gt;&gt; This is what Pentecost produced was a brotherhood. Not a click, not a clan, not a group of human beings gathered together. They did that back down in the Nimrod's Tower of Babel. But this was not a gathering of human beings vessels. Yeah. that you would immor, display your life where the attributes of God are assembled together, baptized into one body by one spirit inside of this great brotherhood. Oh, it's not a club. It's not something where one human admits another. No. No. You're the one, Lord. You're the one bringing every one of your children back home. You're the one that deals with our hearts. You're the one that's brought us to this place of submission. You're the one who baptizes us into yourself that God, this same life might dwell within us. And then we're part of the divine circuit where the love of God where we can actually begin to see this scripture fulfilled to love one another &gt;&gt; as I have loved you. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us tonight. This is where you call us even as husbands to operate with that same love. You help us Lord. You called us Lord Jesus as a body. Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; Father I thank you Lord God for your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to see dear God how all of this would measure up. As Paul said though I can do many great things. We've been through that. and have not love, it's nothing. So Lord Jesus, it's the love of God that brings the value gives us the right understanding that's not an understanding of your word that looks down on others, &gt;&gt; picks one another apart. Lord, we're not vultures. We're eagles. We're not meant, Lord, to feed on one another. Feed on one another's failures or mistakes. Not only here in this assembly, but throughout, dear God, I pray. Father, granted, &gt;&gt; Satan's busy enough to try to tear down this message and wanting to tear down this one and tear down that one. God help us. May we hold up the standard, Lord, &gt;&gt; and to know that God, how many times that we have needed your grace and we still need it. Help us. That's the strength within the brotherhood of the love of God operating in our lives. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. May our lives be an expression that God would be that of the redeemer reaching out to others and say we're not some club that you can't join. But if you're thirsty, there's a fountain to satisfy you. If you're hungry, there's spiritual food in due season. Needs within your life, problems, why? He's the one. and he'll take care of every situation in your life. Lord God, it's redeemer anointing that reaches out through us to invite others into this great &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; body of Jesus Christ. We don't give nobody the Holy Ghost, but the life travels through the body. So Lord help us. Help us Lord. Forgive us Lord. I pray and help us to have the right balance. Teach us Lord. I ask just as even we walk away from this service tonight would you just Lord even in our times of prayer Lord God as we would just come before you. Teach us. Help us not to say, "Well, when I retire." No. No. Cuz when we retire, we'll have a greater accountability and responsibility than what we had when we were working. But with what we have right now, little is much when God is in it. I believe Lord with all my heart, dear God, the joy of the Lord even in hearts and lives, we're going to see that joy return. Then Lord God, we can ask Lord, help me. Help me to have that balance because to let that joy flow through our lives. Let me be an expression to somebody else. Grant it, Lord. And not just out there, but right here in this assembly, maybe a call, a card, or as you spoke to us tonight, get meals together for different ones when there's been needs. Oh, I know we're we're not a big group. We're a little group, but God, little as much when you're in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't about trying to satisfy Z everybody's hunger. It's about that expression, I care about you, brother. &gt;&gt; I care about you, sister. More than just, well, it's in my heart. It's in my heart. But God, how can they see what's in our heart if it's not expressed? [Music] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Help us, Father. We love you, Lord. We appreciate you. In the name of Jesus Christ. Grant it Lord. Hallelujah. Oh glory. I don't know if you feel like me but I say Lord help me. Help me. A lot of things you can walk away and and pray about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let God work within our lives. &gt;&gt; If you start to feel like an excuse come up, say no. I'm not putting any excuse cuz you know what? There's no limitations. God, what would you have me to be in this time? Great leaders. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's the way it's got to be. Oh, I need more of &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Till there's no room. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Consume us, Lord. Consume every bit of Samuel. Lord God, &gt;&gt; all those wasted hours and minutes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're yours now. From the start to the finish. I need more love. Mhm. Oh, I need more of I need more of you, Lord. [Music] Oh, that's the way. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, Lord. got to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's our prayer tonight. Lord God, I need more of you till there's no room left in me.

But, Father, we may never do those things, but we can still minister, Lord God, one to another, Lord. We can pray for one another. We can visit one another, Lord. we can call or text or all these ways of communication we have these days these phones that we've been given Lord to to be able to communicate so easily Lord God all it would take maybe something that would just encourage someone Lord Jesus and you could use us Lord to talk to them or to just send them a message say I love you brother appreciate you and praying for you Lord help us to become just as you came down you you didn't come in the in the Lord to be served you came to serve Lord and that's what we're here to do Lord help us. May we in prayer, Lord. Seek your face and say, "Lord, here am I. Send me. What can I do to help my brothers and sisters, Lord, may you grant it, Lord. May we become more like you, Lord Jesus."
