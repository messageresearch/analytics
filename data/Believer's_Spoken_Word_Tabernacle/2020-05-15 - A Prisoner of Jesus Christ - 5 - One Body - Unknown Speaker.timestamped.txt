[36:26] sometimes that things come out in a
[36:28] wedding and the only thing people really
[36:30] come out with there's a lot of debt but
[36:34] you want to come out further in love so
[36:38] we just want to remember them in prayer
[36:41] we want to look here in the word tonight
[36:45] in them in a thought and just ask God
[36:47] will just come and speak to our hearts
[36:49] I'm just going to read one verse of
[36:51] scripture and then we'll let you be
[36:52] seated in verse 27 Paul is this is even
[36:57] the opening parts remember to the church
[37:00] that is there or the churches rather in
[37:02] Philip I only let your conversation be
[37:07] as it becometh the gospel of Christ that
[37:11] whether I come and see you or else be
[37:15] absent I may hear of your affairs that
[37:19] you stand fast that means persistent and
[37:22] firm in one spirit with one mind
[37:26] striving together for the faith of the
[37:31] gospel
[37:33] now Lord this will take more than a
[37:35] man's job
[37:37] this will take God amen
[37:41] may God bless you bless the reading of
[37:43] the word as you're being seated notice
[37:47] the desire that Paul would Express here
[37:51] and I want to continue within that
[37:54] thought of a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[37:56] but I want to kind of move over into
[37:59] some things and just as the Lord is just
[38:01] really a quickened many things and just
[38:04] sort of just teach some things and look
[38:07] at it in the first of all in that of one
[38:11] body and that's really the underlying
[38:12] thought tonight I want to deal with
[38:14] here's one body and you'll notice how
[38:17] Paul put it that we would be striving
[38:20] together for the faith of the gospel and
[38:24] not striving with one another but
[38:27] striving together and we've got one
[38:30] laboring for one objective and there's
[38:33] one purpose among us and that's the
[38:35] faith of the gospel that's the same
[38:36] faith that you would write off the
[38:38] common salvation the faith that was once
[38:40] delivered to the Saints and so with it
[38:44] you know if there is a an exhortation
[38:47] that we would strive as a body of
[38:51] believers as an army then it shows
[38:54] there's going to be opposition it shows
[38:56] that it's not going to be smooth sailing
[38:58] but do we there will be opposition that
[39:01] will be against it and so Paul would
[39:04] write this and this is where I want to
[39:06] do deal with or or move from here
[39:09] tonight in back in the very first verse
[39:12] of Philippians 1 Paul noticed the
[39:15] opening of this letter Paul says Paul
[39:17] and to mo theists the servants of Jesus
[39:20] Christ to all the Saints in Christ Jesus
[39:25] which are at Philippi with the bishops
[39:29] plural and deacons plural grace be unto
[39:33] you and peace from God our Father and
[39:35] from the Lord Jesus Christ now every one
[39:39] of us you would just would maybe take
[39:44] for granted just for a moment
[39:46] here tonight in that remember the last
[39:50] Commission and it is still the general
[39:52] orders that's given to the Church of the
[39:54] Living God is that of mark 16 go you
[39:58] therefore into all the world teaching
[40:01] all nations and baptizing them in the
[40:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ they were
[40:08] charged with this commission to preach
[40:11] the gospel you see the blood had already
[40:13] been shed and the life now had come back
[40:17] to the Church of the Living God the Holy
[40:19] Ghost had returned now the preaching of
[40:23] the gospel was to be the sounding of the
[40:26] jubilee trumpet it was to announce the
[40:29] trumpet would be sounded to announce the
[40:32] blood had been shed the ought the
[40:34] atonement had been offered up and it had
[40:37] been received and so it would be there
[40:40] of the very atonement or the life of the
[40:43] atonement of Christ himself coming now
[40:46] and declaring this Liberty in and
[40:49] through how the the mystical body of
[40:53] Jesus Christ and yet when we look at
[40:55] this in mark 16 you do not find one
[40:59] mention in mark 16 of pastors you don't
[41:02] find one mention of deacons why it
[41:05] wasn't the time yet so we recognized
[41:10] that within this you know even as we we
[41:13] look at this in this time that Paul is
[41:16] writing here to local churches
[41:19] collectively that have been established
[41:22] through the region of Philip I it was
[41:25] not one just one church in Philippi many
[41:27] times you find where Paul where even
[41:30] writing the churches in that are in Asia
[41:32] salute you
[41:33] there were many churches and so where
[41:37] Paul is writing this letter is not just
[41:39] going to one church because there were
[41:43] multiple local churches even as it
[41:46] expressed their to the Saints in Christ
[41:48] Jesus to the bishops and the Deacons and
[41:53] so when we look at it there's an
[41:55] admonition here and I want to just
[41:57] really Zone in on this
[41:59] and really if so drag my feet on it just
[42:02] to lay these things in that there is
[42:05] first of all he is writing to the Saints
[42:08] that are in Christ Jesus he's not just
[42:11] writing to a group of people but it is
[42:13] to the Saints Saints meaning the
[42:15] sanctified ones those who are in Christ
[42:19] Jesus this is a personal letter think
[42:23] about it that you were among in one of
[42:25] the churches that were there in Philippi
[42:27] and this letter would be delivered
[42:29] though it is being read to all but you
[42:32] dwelling in Christ Jesus you could look
[42:34] at it and say he wrote this just to me
[42:37] God had the messenger delivered this
[42:41] message just for me it's that personal
[42:45] because it's that personal to us tonight
[42:48] when we read the scriptures we're not
[42:50] reading something of a historical
[42:52] account we are reading something of a
[42:54] love letter that is made real to our
[42:57] hearts we recognize that though the
[42:59] message win and the ascent to any
[43:02] broadcast throughout all the earth but
[43:04] yet there was a for ordained elect of
[43:08] God of who that message was intended for
[43:10] so it's not by chance that this word
[43:14] come across your pathway you did not
[43:17] find him he found you he knew exactly
[43:21] where you were at and the second thing
[43:24] that we could draw a love this that
[43:26] would be a set forth that it would be
[43:29] much like if Paul were let's just say
[43:32] Paul or let's just say brother Branham
[43:34] was writing you know and say to the
[43:36] churches in Ohio and he was writing to
[43:39] the churches in Ohio local churches in
[43:42] an area notice what is exhorting a unity
[43:45] among the body of Jesus Christ they
[43:49] would be striving together that no
[43:51] matter what assembly you go to there
[43:53] ought to be the same motive and same
[43:56] objective and that is Jesus Christ that
[44:00] should be the objective and let me just
[44:03] say very clearly that what God has sent
[44:07] to us in this hour
[44:09] this is why that we can say that this
[44:12] church this more than a building but a
[44:14] place that God has given us and how God
[44:16] has called us together it is that the
[44:19] message that God has sent to us that it
[44:22] would be declared and not just declared
[44:24] but that there would be lives come forth
[44:27] there would be lives that would match
[44:29] and reflect the vision that God showed
[44:32] to the Prophet it is God's work
[44:35] God overseeing it all and so it would be
[44:38] like that where we are striving together
[44:40] for the faith in one spirit and in one
[44:44] mind you know how the Prophet would
[44:47] admonish us in discernment of spirit he
[44:50] would talk about us having a local a
[44:52] home church and he said now don't dis
[44:55] fellowship the other guy that don't
[44:57] belong to your assembly but he said I'll
[45:00] discern we ought to a discern what are
[45:03] they trying to do for the kingdom of God
[45:06] is it the kingdom of God bet they're
[45:08] trying to advance they might have
[45:10] different ideas on certain things
[45:12] because we are all a little bit
[45:14] different but there ought to be the same
[45:16] revelation that is being proclaimed and
[45:19] that is the Lord Jesus Christ when it
[45:23] gets to where a man is put before and a
[45:26] man starts to stand out that's the wrong
[45:28] reflection it ought to be Jesus Christ
[45:31] to where that's Paul himself the
[45:33] messenger that ade he was with fear and
[45:36] trembling lest that they would get
[45:38] confidence in him he wanted their
[45:41] confidence to be in the power of God and
[45:45] so then we look at even the next thing
[45:48] because we realize that we've got one
[45:50] common enemy and that's the devil so
[45:54] thirdly there would be each local body
[45:57] that would be there if do you know a
[46:00] bishop which is a pastor of every
[46:03] assembly there would be deacons there
[46:05] with that assembly they would be united
[46:08] together under the leadership of the
[46:10] Holy Ghost pressing and striving
[46:13] together for the faith you know what it
[46:16] looks like an army
[46:19] there's brigades are very large a
[46:23] brigade would you know can make up
[46:26] almost an entire base but inside of
[46:29] there there are multiple platoons is
[46:33] that right in every platoon you know
[46:35] they can't be looking at you know the
[46:38] Brigadier General or the brigade general
[46:40] they can't just be look at em and saying
[46:41] well you know what I'm expecting you to
[46:43] come down on here and do the inspection
[46:45] no the brigade general said listen
[46:47] husband and father you're to do
[46:49] inspection in your home and then you
[46:52] bring your troops here and then the
[46:55] troops are assembled together among a
[46:58] local body and the local body is a part
[47:01] here of other local bodies which are a
[47:03] part of the universal body of Jesus
[47:08] Christ my who can do that but god oh
[47:14] thank God for His mercy so it comes down
[47:18] to really the same objective and that's
[47:20] Jesus Christ now I want you to think of
[47:23] this here as we look in the scripture in
[47:26] mark 16 because there are many churches
[47:30] but notice there is one church that
[47:34] Jesus claims as his own it's not a
[47:37] building it's not not a group or just a
[47:42] gathering of people but rather it is
[47:44] lives that are transformed and
[47:48] illuminated by his own life now notice
[47:52] in Matthew 16 15 he said unto them but
[47:56] whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[47:59] answered and said thou art the Christ
[48:01] the Son of the Living God and jesus
[48:05] answered and said unto Him blessed art
[48:08] thou simon barjona for flesh and blood
[48:10] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[48:13] father which is in heaven and I say also
[48:16] unto thee that thou art Peter and upon
[48:20] this rock I will build my church and the
[48:25] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[48:28] it I will give unto thee the keys of the
[48:30] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[48:33] shalt
[48:33] found on earth shall be bound in heaven
[48:35] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[48:37] shall be loosed in heaven so notice as
[48:41] Jesus is expressing this here he's not
[48:45] was we understand he's not talking about
[48:47] brick-and-mortar or just a group of
[48:50] people who would come under a name of a
[48:52] church but we recognize he said my
[48:55] church he claims he has his church and
[48:59] his church is that which is made up by
[49:04] the redemptive work of Calvary it is
[49:08] what he himself has called and justified
[49:11] it's what he himself has sanctified and
[49:15] it is he himself that is stepped in the
[49:17] midst of his church because his church
[49:20] is to be a reflection of him on earth
[49:23] you're aware and were aware of it it
[49:26] wasn't until you know many hundreds of
[49:28] years later before they ever had church
[49:30] buildings but there were churches and
[49:33] churches where that where there was
[49:35] gatherings of believers that were
[49:38] brought together but there is and there
[49:41] has been and there is one true Church of
[49:44] the Living God
[49:45] you can't join it you have to be born
[49:51] into it it's by elective grace you don't
[49:56] matter what your status are it didn't
[49:59] matter if somebody was a master or
[50:01] somebody was a servant didn't matter
[50:03] what matters is God dealing with the
[50:07] life that he already foreknew even the
[50:10] darkness that can be around that life
[50:12] but underneath that darkness was a
[50:14] redeemable attribute that he came to
[50:18] bring that into expression just like
[50:21] this building there were bricks that
[50:23] came together to make this building
[50:26] there was somebody had a vision
[50:28] somebody had a plan of the layout that
[50:31] he would go likewise that God has been
[50:34] assembly down through the ages a
[50:37] habitation for himself that he could
[50:40] dwell in there has been bricks there has
[50:43] been rocks there has been material that
[50:45] it
[50:45] already been here and he has been
[50:48] gathering that and forming his body down
[50:51] through the ages so the true church is
[50:56] brought forth here he was announcing it
[51:00] and it is brought forth the true church
[51:03] which is the body of Jesus Christ
[51:05] is brought forth after that of the
[51:09] Resurrection and the sending back of the
[51:11] Holy Ghost now in Leviticus 23 let's
[51:14] look at this just a moment in Leviticus
[51:16] 23 verse 15 we understand that these are
[51:19] the feasts of the Lord which speak of
[51:21] each one of them speak of the stages and
[51:24] the unfolding of that of the redemptive
[51:27] work clear to then of the regather of
[51:30] the Jews so when we look at this here
[51:34] recognizing that the wave sheaf had been
[51:36] waved that Jesus Christ himself was the
[51:39] firstfruits from among them who slept he
[51:42] was that wave sheet that that was that
[51:45] which come to maturity he was waved over
[51:48] the people how the day of Pentecost it
[51:51] was him the son of man that was being
[51:54] waved over the people remember they were
[51:56] disheartened they were scattered they
[51:58] were going right back to what they
[52:00] always had done but you see the call of
[52:03] the word upon their life they you know
[52:06] to them they didn't know what to do but
[52:08] remember God is the one that knows how
[52:11] to assemble his people together he began
[52:14] to reveal himself in his resurrection
[52:17] power it began to call them together and
[52:20] it brought them to a place to where God
[52:23] could bring them into that which he had
[52:26] promised I will build my church now
[52:30] notice this here in Leviticus 23 verse
[52:33] 15 it said you shall count unto you from
[52:36] the morrow after the Sabbath from the
[52:38] day that you brought the sheaf of the
[52:41] wave offering seven Sabbath's shall be
[52:43] complete even unto the morrow after the
[52:47] seventh Sabbath shall be a number 50
[52:49] days and ye shall offer a new meat
[52:52] offering unto the Lord
[52:54] remember when Jesus arose they work he
[52:57] was gathered together with them for
[52:59] forty days is that right and then
[53:01] remember they had a Sabbath day's
[53:03] journey to get back to Jerusalem and
[53:06] there they were they came back gathered
[53:08] back to Jerusalem and on the day of
[53:11] Pentecost not just to where it would
[53:13] fall in the calendar but what God
[53:15] Himself identified in keeping true to
[53:18] his own word he was no longer going to
[53:21] be a tight but now the an attack was
[53:23] going to come now want you to watch this
[53:25] here how that they would bring this this
[53:28] sheaf and it says in verse 26 let me
[53:31] read it again even unto the morrow after
[53:34] the seventh Sabbath shall you number
[53:36] fifty days and ye shall offer a new meat
[53:38] offering unto the Lord and ye shall
[53:40] bring out of your habitations to wave
[53:44] loads of 210th deals they shall be a
[53:48] fine flower they shall be bacon with
[53:52] leaven they are the firstfruits unto the
[53:55] Lord now notice the way sheep that was
[53:58] plucked up a type of Christ there is no
[54:01] leaven to be offered with that it was it
[54:04] was that of a of a grouping of of the
[54:10] the week that were brought together has
[54:13] sheets that were raised up and they were
[54:15] waved but here you find that what is to
[54:19] be waived is loaves of bread its grain
[54:22] that has come to maturity it is grain
[54:25] that has been ground to find flour and
[54:28] they had eleven and they bake those wave
[54:31] loads why it's showing that in Christ
[54:33] there is no leaven but in the church
[54:36] there is still eleven come on now it's
[54:40] the same way in your life there's a part
[54:42] of your life when you've really been
[54:44] born again by the Spirit of God in your
[54:46] soul there is no leaven but we still
[54:49] pack around this leaven thing is that
[54:52] right
[54:52] we still have leaven in the Church of
[54:54] the Living God it's this thing right
[54:57] here that gets on other people's nerves
[54:59] and people get on this thing's nerves is
[55:01] that right
[55:02] what who can who can bring this all
[55:04] together who could do and who would
[55:06] think to bring a bunch of people who are
[55:09] so different
[55:11] makeups our temperaments our viewpoints
[55:13] and all those things who could bring
[55:15] this together and bring it all under one
[55:18] head one uniting there's no one could do
[55:21] this but Jesus Christ himself Edie you
[55:24] say paradox let me just say like this
[55:26] not only is the universal body of Jesus
[55:30] Christ around the world of paradox not
[55:33] only is it a paradox
[55:34] within every state and city it is a
[55:37] paradox within every local assembly no
[55:44] glory be to God so now look at the
[55:47] forming of these two wave laws we are to
[55:50] be the first fruits endowed that by the
[55:52] Spirit of God now notice when we look at
[55:55] this here in the scriptures in verse 6
[55:58] of Acts chapter 1 here says in the
[56:04] scripture when they were come together
[56:06] they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou
[56:09] at this time restore again the kingdom
[56:12] to Israel and he said unto them it is
[56:15] not for you to know the times or the
[56:17] seasons which the father hath put in his
[56:19] own power but you shall receive power
[56:22] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[56:25] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[56:29] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[56:32] in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts
[56:36] of the world so it's the witness of the
[56:39] Holy Ghost through our lives it's not us
[56:44] packing the message it's the Holy Ghost
[56:46] in us packing the message amen glory be
[56:51] to God you know the reality it comes
[56:53] down to it you know you may not be able
[56:56] to preach a sermon you may not even feel
[56:58] like I don't even feel like I can put
[57:00] certain things together but that's not
[57:02] what God's are asking you to do just do
[57:04] what God's asking you to do let your
[57:07] life be a witness because your life can
[57:09] preach sermons brother it means more I
[57:12] don't care how eloquent how much that a
[57:15] man could put together it is the
[57:17] preaching of the gospel through a life
[57:20] that is surrendered unto God that
[57:22] real thunder against the devil is lives
[57:26] that are yielded to we're just a way
[57:28] that those lives conduct themselves and
[57:31] live and they express that Jesus Christ
[57:34] is the same yesterday today and forever
[57:36] that's real thunder against the devil's
[57:39] camp brother it's thousands of voices
[57:42] voices that hunger out purity voices
[57:46] that Thunder out godliness voices that
[57:48] plunder out holiness Oh glory may our
[57:54] lives be like that that was spoken of
[57:57] the house of Jason in the book of Acts
[57:59] they turned this city upside down glory
[58:04] be to God you realize it's like how
[58:08] brother Branham would put it back in
[58:09] perspective one man that gets on fire
[58:11] with the Holy Ghost will do more for a
[58:13] church than a multitude of revivals one
[58:18] man that gets on fire with God a revival
[58:21] all it takes is one that's all it takes
[58:24] and you know what you don't gotta wait
[58:27] on nobody else you can say right here
[58:29] Lord right here let me be the revival
[58:32] Lord now think of this when we look at
[58:37] it you know they they are spoken to in
[58:41] verse nine and it would mention to them
[58:44] and when they were spoken they were
[58:46] while they were beheld he was taken up
[58:49] and a cloud received him out of their
[58:51] sight and while they looked steadfastly
[58:53] toward heaven as he went up behold two
[58:56] men by them stood by them in white
[58:58] apparel which also said you men of
[59:01] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[59:04] heaven this same Jesus which is taken up
[59:07] from you into heaven shall so come in
[59:09] like manner as you have seen him go into
[59:12] heaven evidently they need a little bit
[59:15] of stimulation in the right way they
[59:19] were so an hour I mean they had walked
[59:21] with him for forty days and they're
[59:23] standing there in gazing now you know
[59:25] think of it here it would be natural for
[59:28] them to gaze and to look at this to
[59:31] where all of a sudden here the way that
[59:33] the very there was space
[59:35] that begin to come between his feet and
[59:38] the earth they were gazing into watts
[59:40] now remember it wasn't so much that they
[59:43] hadn't seen miracles they had seen
[59:44] miracle after miracle but every miracle
[59:48] that they witnessed even when he would
[59:50] appear right there in their myths when
[59:52] they were gathered in the room even when
[59:54] here he was on the bank and they were
[59:56] fishing you know everywhere he would
[59:59] come and and they would turn up and or
[1:00:01] he would turn up they would come around
[1:00:03] this way here he would be they were
[1:00:04] there as a place with it where he not
[1:00:07] only instructed them but they saw the
[1:00:09] miracles and the same resurrected Lord
[1:00:12] Jesus Christ but evidently they were
[1:00:15] looking a little bit too long so what
[1:00:19] would the angel stand they were telling
[1:00:21] them you're not just to talk about the
[1:00:24] message you've got to get under the
[1:00:26] blood they were letting them know yeah
[1:00:29] it's glorious yes it's wonderful but you
[1:00:33] need to follow the orders you've been
[1:00:35] commanded to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:00:38] glory be to God so they returned the
[1:00:41] Bible says unto Jerusalem from the mount
[1:00:44] called all of it which is from Jerusalem
[1:00:46] a Sabbath day's journey now in verse 1
[1:00:49] of Acts 2 when the day of Pentecost was
[1:00:53] fully come they were all with one Accord
[1:00:56] in one place they were not even born
[1:01:01] again yet how could they be in one chord
[1:01:08] one Accord in one place well first of
[1:01:10] all if they happen to bend the holy
[1:01:12] ghost would have never come because the
[1:01:14] holy ghost who have not come where
[1:01:15] there's dissension and that's a
[1:01:19] responsibility that comes on our lives
[1:01:21] in our homes in the churches and so
[1:01:24] forth just like even in a meeting my
[1:01:26] mama you know and sometimes you can get
[1:01:28] in meetings and and I'll tell you what
[1:01:30] there can be divisions that come right
[1:01:31] there in that meeting you get different
[1:01:33] perspective it ought not be there ought
[1:01:35] to be one objective and that is that
[1:01:38] Jesus Christ wouldn't be glorified
[1:01:41] I think that ought to be every objective
[1:01:45] even you know and coming into a meeting
[1:01:47] we're not trying to have somebody see
[1:01:49] things rise there is a liberty inside of
[1:01:52] this word is to exalt Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] we're not here to exalt the idea of any
[1:01:59] man because this message is not man's
[1:02:02] ideas these are not the thoughts of
[1:02:05] William Branham this is the thoughts of
[1:02:08] God that have been expressed to us in
[1:02:11] this hour oh god help us and suddenly
[1:02:18] there came a sound from heaven as of a
[1:02:21] rushing mighty wind he filled all the
[1:02:23] house where they were sitting and there
[1:02:25] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[1:02:28] as a fire and it's set upon each of them
[1:02:32] God knows where to find you and they
[1:02:35] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:38] began to speak with other tongues as the
[1:02:40] Spirit gave them utterance God was
[1:02:45] bringing them together the revelation
[1:02:47] was bringing them together that he
[1:02:49] himself might step in the midst of them
[1:02:53] that he himself now think of this that
[1:02:56] he might assemble the wave sheaf now
[1:03:00] assembling the graves the the grains in
[1:03:03] wave lows not separate pieces but one
[1:03:09] living organism one body you see what
[1:03:13] he's doing now the scripture goes on and
[1:03:17] think of this with the bread it speaks
[1:03:19] in first Corinthians 10 verse 15
[1:03:23] Paul said I speak as two wise men
[1:03:25] judging what I say the cup of blessing
[1:03:28] which we bless is it not the communion
[1:03:31] of the blood of Christ the bread which
[1:03:35] we break is it not the communion of the
[1:03:38] body of Christ
[1:03:40] for we being many are one bread and one
[1:03:45] body for we are all partakers of that
[1:03:49] one
[1:03:50] now remember in the scriptures here
[1:03:53] let's look at this
[1:03:54] the partaking of the Living bread
[1:03:57] because remember as Jesus would tell him
[1:04:00] here in John 632 he said Moses gave you
[1:04:03] not the bread from heaven but my father
[1:04:06] giveth you the true bread from heaven
[1:04:08] now once you remember when they came out
[1:04:11] of Egypt
[1:04:13] the purpose of coming out of Egypt was
[1:04:17] that they might go into their
[1:04:18] inheritance
[1:04:20] God knew that they only had provision
[1:04:24] for so long but this is where God would
[1:04:27] take an opportunity to make himself
[1:04:29] known among his people that I'm your
[1:04:32] provider
[1:04:35] and mana remember how that mana it will
[1:04:38] it would fall there and they would go
[1:04:40] out and gather that mana
[1:04:42] now think of this many of them Paul
[1:04:45] wrote event like this how many of them
[1:04:47] eight of the mana they ate or they drank
[1:04:51] from the spiritual rock but yet when it
[1:04:55] came time to go take the inheritance
[1:04:58] they said we can do it so though they
[1:05:01] were eating the manna and they were
[1:05:03] drinking from the spiritual rock but
[1:05:06] they weren't receiving strength from it
[1:05:08] you know if you could be in Joshua and
[1:05:10] Caleb spent and when they themselves
[1:05:13] would have had that manner that they
[1:05:15] gathered they would say praise God God
[1:05:18] provided for us right here gods provided
[1:05:21] for us all along I tell you God has sent
[1:05:23] to us just what we need Caleb what do
[1:05:26] you think it's gonna be like what I'm
[1:05:27] gonna tell you what I think it's gonna
[1:05:28] be like I'm gonna tell you just as he
[1:05:31] provided bread for today they'll be
[1:05:34] bread for the day when we get ready to
[1:05:36] close what do you mean put it in terms
[1:05:39] for right now the same quickening power
[1:05:42] that has come down and redeemed your
[1:05:45] soul it will continue to quicken you and
[1:05:48] quicken you and quicken you until you
[1:05:51] stand on the other side it's living
[1:05:55] bread of life
[1:05:58] so this bread that we're speaking of
[1:06:01] just like when we take communion here it
[1:06:04] starts out as one piece of unleavened
[1:06:08] bread to show that in the body of Jesus
[1:06:11] Christ
[1:06:11] there should be no eleven because there
[1:06:14] is no leaven in him is that right but
[1:06:18] then it is broken he meant his body it
[1:06:22] was broken for us he gave of his life
[1:06:25] that we might receive of that life that
[1:06:29] also there is within the blood now when
[1:06:32] we look at this he goes on to say but my
[1:06:35] father giveth you the true bread from
[1:06:37] heaven for the bread of God is he which
[1:06:40] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[1:06:43] unto the world so we're talking about
[1:06:45] life here we're talking about a
[1:06:48] person here this is the bread of God
[1:06:51] then said they unto Him Lord evermore
[1:06:54] give us this bread and Jesus said I am
[1:06:58] the bread of life
[1:07:01] they were looking around where is this
[1:07:04] at and he announced to him I am that
[1:07:07] bread of life he that cometh to me shall
[1:07:10] never hunger but he that believeth on me
[1:07:14] shall never thirst what is it saying
[1:07:17] this bread brother is a satisfying
[1:07:20] portion it won't just hold you over from
[1:07:25] Thursday to Sunday and then it might
[1:07:27] keep you next year when this prayer has
[1:07:31] been partaking of I'm talking about
[1:07:33] Christ I'm talking about the word
[1:07:36] brother will it moves into your life you
[1:07:39] are satisfied the devil can put
[1:07:42] everything that he wants to put in front
[1:07:44] of you you have found that which has
[1:07:48] ministered life to you hallelujah you'll
[1:07:54] never thirst again glory be to God I am
[1:07:59] that Bread of Life your father's did eat
[1:08:03] manna in the wilderness they're dead
[1:08:05] this is the bread which cometh down from
[1:08:08] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[1:08:10] not die I am that Living bread which
[1:08:14] came down from heaven If any man eat of
[1:08:17] this bread he shall live forever and the
[1:08:20] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[1:08:22] I give for the life of the world
[1:08:26] amen Oh glory I think of this here Paul
[1:08:32] in writing this here here he would write
[1:08:37] in the exhortation - even to that of
[1:08:41] Ephesians the same thought he says in
[1:08:44] verse 4 there is one body one spirit
[1:08:48] even as you are called in one hope of
[1:08:52] your calling one Lord one faith
[1:08:56] one baptism one God and Father of all
[1:08:59] who is above all and through all and in
[1:09:03] you all and once you look at this verse
[1:09:06] but unto every one of us is given grace
[1:09:09] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:09:14] Christ
[1:09:16] it's not something we earned it's not
[1:09:20] what we can merit this gift of Christ is
[1:09:24] the bread of life
[1:09:26] it's his life come on now they had been
[1:09:30] taken remember they forfeited that life
[1:09:33] there in Eden but Jesus when he came he
[1:09:36] stood and declared he said I am come to
[1:09:39] bear witness to the truth and Pilate
[1:09:42] said what is truth
[1:09:43] right truth is not a doctrine truth is
[1:09:48] not a sentence truth is a person I am
[1:09:51] the way the truth and the life
[1:09:55] amen is talking about the word this is
[1:09:58] the bread of life it becomes strength to
[1:10:00] our life we just don't come to church as
[1:10:03] people and say well I wonder if when I
[1:10:05] come here if I feel good when I leave
[1:10:07] you may not you may not feel good but
[1:10:09] there's one thing about it
[1:10:10] we've got confidence in the Living God
[1:10:13] that word that's coming forth it's
[1:10:15] changing our lives even when we don't
[1:10:18] seem like it's working brother it's
[1:10:20] having an effect you know why we're not
[1:10:23] just here but we can get with that we
[1:10:26] just we can receive we are here to be
[1:10:29] strengthened by this word in this hour
[1:10:32] we are making ready for a translation
[1:10:38] notice every one of us is under every
[1:10:42] one of us is given grace according to
[1:10:45] the measure of the gift of Christ Paul
[1:10:49] would write in picking up here in 1st
[1:10:51] Corinthians 12:1 he said now concerning
[1:10:55] spiritual gifts brethren I would not
[1:10:58] have you ignorant you know that you were
[1:11:01] Gentiles carried away with these dumb
[1:11:03] idols even as you were led wherefore I
[1:11:07] give you to understand that no man
[1:11:10] speaking by the Spirit of God calleth
[1:11:13] jesus accursed and that no man can say
[1:11:17] that jesus is the Lord but by or that
[1:11:20] word is in the Holy Ghost
[1:11:24] nobody can call him Lord but by the
[1:11:27] indwelling of his life you see what he's
[1:11:31] dealing with this is the foundation of
[1:11:35] every believer this is the foundation of
[1:11:38] all workings in the body is that Jesus
[1:11:43] Christ is the lord of that life that's
[1:11:48] the foundation that's not an option he
[1:11:52] must be the life amen it must be
[1:11:58] declared in that life he is the Lord
[1:12:00] why because about him being Lord it
[1:12:04] recalls to us to relinquish our ideas
[1:12:08] and we're going to have him it causes us
[1:12:11] to relinquish our opinions and we have
[1:12:13] them what has to be there's got to be
[1:12:16] something greater there's got to be
[1:12:19] something greater to where he is Lord
[1:12:23] then we've got the right beginning we've
[1:12:26] got the right headship then in order to
[1:12:28] be able to submit ourselves to one
[1:12:30] another in the body of Jesus Christ now
[1:12:33] notice in verse 4 Paul would were right
[1:12:36] it could go on there are diversities of
[1:12:39] gifts but the same spirit
[1:12:43] there's differences of administration's
[1:12:46] but the same Lord there are diversities
[1:12:50] of operations but it is the same God
[1:12:54] which worketh all in all but the
[1:12:58] manifestation of the Spirit is given to
[1:13:01] every man to profit withal four to one
[1:13:04] is given by the spirit the word of
[1:13:07] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[1:13:09] by the same spirit to another faith by
[1:13:13] the same spirit to another the gifts of
[1:13:16] healing by the same spirit to another
[1:13:18] the working of miracles to another
[1:13:20] prophecy to another discerning of
[1:13:23] spirits to another divers kinds of
[1:13:26] tongues to another the interpretation of
[1:13:29] tongues but all these notice how Paul
[1:13:31] brings it all together but all these
[1:13:33] workers that one and the selfsame as he
[1:13:42] will
[1:13:46] that is not anything just as nuts as the
[1:13:52] measure of the grace the grace of God
[1:13:55] the gift of Christ is ministered to us
[1:13:58] his life it is the same in how that he
[1:14:03] works through his body there is not one
[1:14:07] remember it did not say that one
[1:14:10] obtained faith or one obtained a gift of
[1:14:14] healing but it says - one is given this
[1:14:17] - one is given a gift of healing
[1:14:19] to another the working of miracles to
[1:14:22] another prophecy and it goes on but who
[1:14:25] is it it is God that is dividing this
[1:14:28] among the body it's the Spirit of God
[1:14:31] now listen we understand there's been a
[1:14:35] lot of false and yet listen in even in
[1:14:38] many instances there and there's been
[1:14:41] the real genuine Spirit of God but
[1:14:43] moving upon a false vessel but that
[1:14:48] don't do away with it it would be just
[1:14:50] like if somebody gave you a counterfeit
[1:14:53] hundred-dollar bill I'm sure you
[1:14:55] wouldn't turn down if somebody put out
[1:14:57] another hundred-dollar bill you might
[1:14:59] beat him to death to get it because you
[1:15:01] don't know you know there's real ones
[1:15:03] out there that's the same way that it is
[1:15:06] with the working of the gifts of God
[1:15:09] there's a genuine and this is where as
[1:15:14] brother Branham would put it like this
[1:15:15] he said that once he sent as you are
[1:15:18] baptized into the body of Jesus Christ
[1:15:21] he said it can fall on this one tonight
[1:15:23] and it may never fall on this one again
[1:15:26] and may fall over here and it may fall
[1:15:29] over here you see God just moves around
[1:15:31] the body with these nine spiritual gifts
[1:15:35] but what's worth it is all for the
[1:15:39] edifying of his body
[1:15:41] now notice on to every one of us let me
[1:15:44] read that again in Ephesians 4 verse 7
[1:15:46] unto every one of us is given grace
[1:15:48] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:15:52] Christ Paul would write in Romans 12
[1:15:55] verse 3 for I say through the grace
[1:15:58] given unto me to every man that is among
[1:16:00] you not to think of himself more highly
[1:16:03] than he ought to think but to think
[1:16:06] soberly sometimes we need to be sobered
[1:16:11] up and this is this is a sobering
[1:16:15] thought according as God hath dealt to
[1:16:19] every man the measure of faith
[1:16:23] we didn't deal it God dealt it to us God
[1:16:27] released it to us what's he doing he's
[1:16:29] unfolding he's releasing a part of
[1:16:32] himself to bring his people together
[1:16:36] he's unfolding is of his life and it
[1:16:40] moves too quick in that life bringing
[1:16:42] that life into him notice it goes on for
[1:16:46] as we have many members in one body and
[1:16:49] all members have not the same office so
[1:16:54] we being many are one body in Christ and
[1:16:59] every one members one of another I know
[1:17:04] it's very simple but my feet is not if
[1:17:07] my feet don't do any good if anything
[1:17:09] attached to this body it don't do any
[1:17:12] good of the body don't do no good for
[1:17:13] the feet matter of fact the Fenian
[1:17:15] attached to the body guess what happens
[1:17:16] to him it cut off from the supply so the
[1:17:21] feet are only a part of the body the
[1:17:24] feet are not the body neither is the
[1:17:25] hands the body it's all a part of the
[1:17:28] body and how Paul under the leading of
[1:17:31] the Holy Spirit would show that the body
[1:17:35] think of it that he would show that the
[1:17:37] working of Christ and how then it would
[1:17:40] be one body that it would be Christ that
[1:17:44] has brought this body together and that
[1:17:46] there are as he said differences in
[1:17:48] administration there's differences in
[1:17:51] there's diversity there's different
[1:17:54] workings even among the gifts he would
[1:17:57] talk about the differences that would be
[1:17:59] there now look at this God even wrote it
[1:18:02] in the heavens and the stars every star
[1:18:05] itself is different and yet they're
[1:18:09] similar that's where he wrote his first
[1:18:12] Bible
[1:18:14] he wrote the first Bible even the
[1:18:17] constellations one star didn't get to
[1:18:20] say you know I don't want to be and I
[1:18:21] don't want to be in Orion's church I
[1:18:22] mean I don't want to be in Orion's
[1:18:24] constellation I don't want to be over
[1:18:26] there with pleadings I don't want to be
[1:18:27] over here no it was in that whence God
[1:18:31] had ordained and you know one star ISM
[1:18:35] doesn't give off a Ryan but it's a
[1:18:38] collection of stars together but go to
[1:18:41] present Orion is that right the seven
[1:18:44] stars reflect Orion or you estimate now
[1:18:47] it's even that when we see the different
[1:18:50] ones in the constellation you know what
[1:18:52] that is when you look up there it's
[1:18:54] always been hard for me to see them you
[1:18:56] know they got the Big Dipper and a
[1:18:57] Little Dipper and I'd look at them and
[1:18:59] say see what you see it yeah yeah I see
[1:19:01] what I see yeah yeah I see it where's it
[1:19:03] at right there no it's over here okay
[1:19:05] yeah yeah I see it yeah right there now
[1:19:07] helped when I got an app on my phone I
[1:19:09] could put it up there and kind of see it
[1:19:11] you know and then there are certain
[1:19:12] nights you could see the Big Dipper and
[1:19:14] other times the Little Dipper and things
[1:19:16] like that but you understand when we
[1:19:18] look at all of that every one of those
[1:19:20] stars have a Mane we don't know them but
[1:19:23] they don't mean they don't got a name
[1:19:25] every one of them even when their
[1:19:27] position that they never put themselves
[1:19:30] there they covered even how the Prophet
[1:19:33] would describe those stars they were
[1:19:35] scattered out there just blown right off
[1:19:38] of his hand but notice he knew just
[1:19:40] exactly where to stop and position each
[1:19:44] one of them so it would tell a story
[1:19:46] every one of them would be a declaration
[1:19:50] as a part within the body so the whole
[1:19:55] of the stars is like that the
[1:19:58] representation of the body of Jesus
[1:20:01] Christ remember he told Abraham at first
[1:20:05] he said count can you count the number
[1:20:07] of the sands of the sea I can't do it he
[1:20:10] said then when he took Abraham the next
[1:20:12] time he asked him to look up to the
[1:20:14] stars he showed that he would take
[1:20:16] Abraham's seed that royal seed from the
[1:20:20] dest
[1:20:21] to the stars a man even translate us and
[1:20:26] meaning that every one of them has a
[1:20:28] significant part in the body
[1:20:34] I hope this is real clear pom would go
[1:20:42] on and write just just a few more
[1:20:44] moments here in verse twelve of first
[1:20:47] Corinthians twelve these scriptures were
[1:20:49] familiar with but I just just wanting to
[1:20:52] lay this in for as the body is one and
[1:20:55] hath many members and all the members of
[1:20:59] that one body being many are one body so
[1:21:02] also is Christ for by one spirit are we
[1:21:08] all baptized into one body whether we be
[1:21:11] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[1:21:15] free and have been all made to drink
[1:21:18] into one spirit for the body is not one
[1:21:23] member but many
[1:21:26] make how Paul and see would he would
[1:21:29] write this here it's him
[1:21:31] it's it's Jesus Christ working in and
[1:21:34] through his body
[1:21:37] he has assembled his broad body and
[1:21:40] brought it forth as he said I will build
[1:21:42] my church which would be his body which
[1:21:45] is that of his wife his bride and he
[1:21:49] would work his life would be reflected
[1:21:52] through the church he would be reflected
[1:21:54] through his body one body not not a
[1:21:58] divided bodies let me just say this very
[1:22:01] clearly when we're reading here in the
[1:22:03] scripture as you see it continues to
[1:22:05] move a move on down here whereas we've
[1:22:08] been looking at this here's one body
[1:22:10] that is around the world the body of
[1:22:13] Jesus Christ
[1:22:14] now listen let me just be very clear to
[1:22:17] be in the body of Jesus Christ as we
[1:22:19] just read it's not anything a person can
[1:22:22] join you've got to be baptized in by the
[1:22:25] Holy Ghost himself he calls you
[1:22:28] justifies you sanctifies you and then he
[1:22:31] inducts you into his body and it's one
[1:22:35] body with one objective one motive one
[1:22:39] purpose and that is Jesus Christ it's
[1:22:43] not an idea it's not it it's not
[1:22:46] somebody's thought it's him and just as
[1:22:52] the whole body that would be gathered
[1:22:54] around the world then as it keeps on
[1:22:57] moving down to where you get then to the
[1:23:00] local bodies to where that every local
[1:23:04] body is to be one as well
[1:23:09] that's right just as it would be even in
[1:23:12] cities even in states but remember Paul
[1:23:16] would write very clearly on this right
[1:23:18] here
[1:23:19] unity is to be with Jesus Christ be in
[1:23:23] the center here Paul would be very clear
[1:23:27] you do not compromise the gospel for
[1:23:30] unity the gospel is not to be
[1:23:35] compromised that's why the striving
[1:23:38] together is for V faith
[1:23:42] there should be unity in that where God
[1:23:46] would establish their of a local body
[1:23:49] let me just say it to you like this that
[1:23:52] every local body a local body is not the
[1:23:56] work of a man God will use a man God
[1:23:58] will send a man into an area but that
[1:24:00] local body it is that which God has put
[1:24:04] a burden on that man's heart the man who
[1:24:07] is standing there has the pastor may not
[1:24:10] even been the man that got used to sin
[1:24:13] in there but God don't have to use the
[1:24:15] same man he sends in there because he's
[1:24:17] got apostles that can go first come on
[1:24:21] now this is God's working in his body
[1:24:23] there's got to be a word taken and then
[1:24:26] a people a church established and then
[1:24:29] God would put a pastor there a watchman
[1:24:32] and in steel all parts of the ministry
[1:24:35] that work together for one achievement
[1:24:40] and that's the kingdom of Almighty God
[1:24:45] hello glory this is why that Paul would
[1:24:49] go on to write in Corinthians 1227 in
[1:24:55] the latter part here he says now you are
[1:24:56] the body of Christ and members in
[1:25:00] particular that particular means you've
[1:25:06] got an allotment you've been allotted
[1:25:09] and a portion there's an inheritance in
[1:25:13] Jesus Christ just like Israel when they
[1:25:17] were coming into the land remember this
[1:25:21] was the Ministry of Joshua to minister
[1:25:24] to them their inheritance to vie to them
[1:25:28] their lot their portion and we have that
[1:25:32] portion in Jesus Christ that's what the
[1:25:35] gospel comes to make known that you were
[1:25:38] always a part of him that's what takes a
[1:25:42] hold of our life it brings about where
[1:25:46] he moves her faith to rise within our
[1:25:49] hearts to believe that he included me
[1:25:54] Calvary was a manifestation to me that I
[1:25:58] was on his mind and the Holy Ghost has
[1:26:01] come to witness that I was included in
[1:26:04] that sacrifice that I have been included
[1:26:06] in Redemption that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:26:10] comes to do Joshua comes to minister to
[1:26:13] us our inheritance and he does it by and
[1:26:17] through his word
[1:26:20] and they just and they just closed in
[1:26:23] this part of it with one body seeing how
[1:26:26] God would bring a body together let me
[1:26:28] just skip to something just for a moment
[1:26:31] here and come down into another
[1:26:35] scripture here it's just frozen if you
[1:26:38] go go to Exodus 25 verse 8
[1:26:48] here is where Israel comes out of the
[1:26:50] land God brings them out of the land and
[1:26:54] remember the first thing that's
[1:26:56] mentioned to Moses are not Moses but to
[1:26:59] to to to Pharaoh
[1:27:02] let my people go let him come out into
[1:27:05] the wilderness three days journey that
[1:27:09] they may hold a feast and Pharaoh
[1:27:13] resisted that but the objective was not
[1:27:17] just run to come into the wilderness God
[1:27:20] wanted his people to come out and
[1:27:23] worship Him
[1:27:26] there was an inheritance that they were
[1:27:28] being called to they couldn't stay in
[1:27:32] Egypt and receive this inheritance they
[1:27:36] had to be called out of there who could
[1:27:39] walk into a nation that is the most
[1:27:41] powerful nation in the world who could
[1:27:44] walk in there and absolutely separate a
[1:27:48] group of people and bring them out God
[1:27:52] God Scott one man separated unto himself
[1:27:58] hallelujah he got Moses separated in his
[1:28:02] hand to her Moses was delivered of Moses
[1:28:07] Moses was not gonna look by his ideas
[1:28:10] because his ideas only produce one dead
[1:28:12] stinking Egyptian you see man's ideas
[1:28:17] only produces dead church members it
[1:28:21] does not bring about the body of Jesus
[1:28:23] Christ this is not a social gathering
[1:28:27] that's not what the Church of the Living
[1:28:29] God is it is Christ himself coming down
[1:28:35] and declaring Redemption to Haaretz that
[1:28:38] men have been so shackled that darkness
[1:28:41] but Jubilee sounds to that life and it
[1:28:45] closed it in to the Liberty the Spirit
[1:28:48] of God is present to proclaim Liberty
[1:28:52] [Applause]
[1:28:54] men's ideas leave it in bondage but
[1:28:59] plumb miracle come out of her
[1:29:03] amen there's an inheritance this message
[1:29:07] it was a message that let him know
[1:29:09] you've got an inheritance they crossed
[1:29:12] through the red sea and as soon as they
[1:29:15] got through the Red Sea here is Moses up
[1:29:18] in the vision I want you to just I want
[1:29:20] to just leave you with these words
[1:29:23] he says let them
[1:29:25] make me my sanctuary that I may dwell
[1:29:32] among them
[1:29:36] left them
[1:29:38] make me a sanctuary
[1:29:40] that I may dwell among
[1:29:44] it truly has to be his work but it'll
[1:29:48] never come forth without hearts with
[1:29:49] wood they have a willingness according
[1:29:55] to all that I show thee after the
[1:29:57] pattern of the tabernacle and the
[1:29:59] pattern of all the instruments thereof
[1:30:01] even so shall you make it think about it
[1:30:07] brother Brandon would read this text and
[1:30:10] what house will you build me a message
[1:30:15] I've listened to that one
[1:30:16] well countless number of times but even
[1:30:20] over months just listening to it going
[1:30:22] back through it he would read this part
[1:30:26] where Stephen would speak Stephen would
[1:30:29] speak about that tabernacle that house
[1:30:33] that Solomon building and he would say
[1:30:37] in verse 48 of Acts 7 howbeit the Most
[1:30:41] High dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:30:43] hands as saith the Prophet heaven is my
[1:30:46] throne and earth is my footstool what
[1:30:48] house will you build me I want you to
[1:30:52] think of these words this is where I'm
[1:30:54] ending up here tonight
[1:30:56] these words not only pertain to the
[1:30:59] universal body of Jesus Christ but if we
[1:31:02] leave it just to a universal body we
[1:31:05] miss it what house will you build me a
[1:31:11] local body of believers
[1:31:20] heaven is my throne earth is my
[1:31:22] footstool what house will you build me
[1:31:24] say at the Lord or what is the place of
[1:31:26] my rest hath not my hand made all of
[1:31:30] these things you know we can dwell we
[1:31:35] can be right here in the same building
[1:31:38] but we want to be in the building Christ
[1:31:44] Jesus that's the body that's the
[1:31:48] building of God is to be in that
[1:31:51] building is to be in that body and when
[1:31:55] the question comes forth what house will
[1:31:57] you build me it didn't just ask and said
[1:32:01] what house Paul will you building
[1:32:04] he asked Paul that question but then he
[1:32:07] comes down he says Brian what house will
[1:32:10] you build me Paul what house were you
[1:32:12] building there what house will you build
[1:32:15] me he's asking a question what house
[1:32:19] will you build me blueheart will build
[1:32:22] you this church he said but my hands I
[1:32:26] provided all this material but what
[1:32:31] God's asking for his surrendered hearts
[1:32:35] surrendered lives lives that are yielded
[1:32:39] like ones when an announcement was made
[1:32:41] and you know David there begin to be
[1:32:43] assembling a material even with Solomon
[1:32:46] that begin to me material and what was
[1:32:49] all that material coming together why
[1:32:51] are we here tonight it's because of one
[1:32:54] purpose
[1:32:56] it's not to build an earthly Kingdom
[1:33:00] it's for the work of the kingdom of God
[1:33:07] it's being one with him and the truly
[1:33:12] being one with him it'll reflect with
[1:33:15] love for one another being of one spirit
[1:33:19] in one mind as I listen to that if you
[1:33:22] haven't listened that in a while I'd
[1:33:23] encourage you to do that and some of the
[1:33:25] things that we'll be looking at here
[1:33:27] what house were you bill me very short
[1:33:30] message twenty seven minutes brother
[1:33:32] branham takes and he speaks before
[1:33:36] brother Perry preaches and he just you
[1:33:38] know they're gonna dedicate that
[1:33:39] Tabernacle there and you hear brother
[1:33:41] branham's voice
[1:33:43] you can just hear him he said I'm so
[1:33:46] happy today I'm so happy
[1:33:50] the reason brother branham was so happy
[1:33:54] there had been people that followed him
[1:33:56] out there
[1:33:57] and brother branham's seen him where
[1:34:00] their kids were just out riding bikes on
[1:34:02] Sunday people were starting to get loose
[1:34:05] and lacks a reclining of the Spirit they
[1:34:09] didn't have no place to go brother brems
[1:34:11] said there weren't even any place for my
[1:34:12] family to go to church
[1:34:15] you know what he was talking about he
[1:34:17] wasn't just talking about a place to go
[1:34:19] to church he was talking about a place
[1:34:21] that could take the full gospel that
[1:34:24] this message could be proclaimed in
[1:34:26] fully where there's no parts of it
[1:34:31] resisted come on now but where Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ is fully welcomed and to st. Cal
[1:34:40] when brother Brandon you could just hear
[1:34:42] it in his heart he declares it but
[1:34:44] you're hearing in his heart he says now
[1:34:45] he said I don't have to drive clear back
[1:34:48] to Jeffersonville to preach when God put
[1:34:50] something on my heart I can come right
[1:34:52] here to this pulpit and deliver that
[1:34:54] message
[1:34:55] I wonder tonight we've gotta let brother
[1:34:59] Branham look over the banister of time
[1:35:01] and see little outpost local churches oh
[1:35:07] my let's come up underneath this message
[1:35:11] where the message that God delivered in
[1:35:14] this generation is going forth it's
[1:35:17] producing a bride for Jesus Christ
[1:35:21] hey man it's assembling those parts that
[1:35:24] have been laid out into what one body
[1:35:28] every local body is one body like a
[1:35:34] platoon that's part of the army of the
[1:35:39] Living God
[1:35:46] glory be to God this is why as we're
[1:35:51] thankful to Almighty God for His grace
[1:35:55] and His mercy to be able to deliver the
[1:36:01] message that he's given to us in this
[1:36:03] hour
[1:36:04] and brother branham wouldn't make that
[1:36:06] statement he would say and we talking to
[1:36:09] the people right there we are a body of
[1:36:14] Christ then I could say that tonight we
[1:36:18] are not the body of Christ we are a body
[1:36:22] of Christ we are one body is to have one
[1:36:27] objective one goal oh my are there some
[1:36:32] times where there's differences of ideas
[1:36:34] and differences of opinions sure why
[1:36:37] because you still got the fine flour how
[1:36:41] do you know when it's fine flour it's
[1:36:42] sticky
[1:36:43] you put your hand in it and it sticks to
[1:36:45] you fine flour you're to make the wave
[1:36:48] loaves out of fine flour
[1:36:52] but thanks be to God there's green grain
[1:36:57] that has come up went through the
[1:36:59] process there is that of resurrection
[1:37:02] power that has brought forth bread
[1:37:06] amen that same life is now reflected in
[1:37:09] a body of believers
[1:37:11] a local body
[1:37:15] once you just to think of this tonight
[1:37:17] God just didn't call you here just to
[1:37:21] sit
[1:37:24] I wish I could preach them more here God
[1:37:29] called you because you've got a purpose
[1:37:34] me
[1:37:36] me what am I to do what can I possibly
[1:37:40] do can anybody tell me the name of the
[1:37:43] little woman who cleaned out the barn
[1:37:45] where the white moody got saved that
[1:37:47] night so you know the name of the white
[1:37:49] moody but you don't know the name of the
[1:37:52] woman who cleaned out the barn but she
[1:37:56] got a burden on her heart to clean out a
[1:37:58] barn brother Aaron to get rid of where
[1:38:01] there was horse manure and everything
[1:38:02] else she had a burden to clear that out
[1:38:05] that there would be a meeting there God
[1:38:07] put that burden on her heart she did
[1:38:10] want her part in it I was not what many
[1:38:13] would look like and say but that was a
[1:38:15] glorious part no it was it was it was a
[1:38:17] stinky part in one way there was a lot
[1:38:20] of dirt and grime and everything else
[1:38:21] was in it but you know what that wasn't
[1:38:23] on her focus what God put her on her
[1:38:25] heart to do she was willing to do it was
[1:38:30] her part butthole how vital that part
[1:38:33] was how many souls were one to the
[1:38:37] kingdom of God by the white Moody's
[1:38:40] ministry because of one one that yielded
[1:38:47] to what God put on their heart to do as
[1:38:50] a local body
[1:38:53] thank God for the body we were not
[1:38:56] isolated we are part of the body of
[1:39:00] Jesus Christ around the world we don't
[1:39:03] ever want an attitude of us for no more
[1:39:08] we need one another we need each and
[1:39:14] every member of the bride of Jesus
[1:39:18] Christ we need every gift that God has
[1:39:22] provided that's right
[1:39:26] they don't just need a pastor we need
[1:39:29] the Evangelist come on now we need the
[1:39:34] teachers they met and prophets let's a
[1:39:38] modern-day preacher we we need every
[1:39:40] part of the body of Jesus Christ we need
[1:39:43] every 9 spiritual gift we need every
[1:39:47] heart that is dedicated and looking and
[1:39:50] that word is reflected through their
[1:39:52] heart there are things that God puts
[1:39:55] upon your heart to do nobody else may
[1:39:58] never know about it
[1:40:00] but after all you're not doing it for
[1:40:02] recognition you're doing it as unto the
[1:40:04] Lord and Paul would write this as we
[1:40:08] started striving together as one body
[1:40:13] for what the faith
[1:40:17] sometimes I just gotta stop sometimes it
[1:40:22] may not look like you could drive by
[1:40:23] here and you see one of the brothers out
[1:40:26] the lawn where you say I don't look very
[1:40:27] spiritual but what happens if somebody
[1:40:29] didn't do that that's a reflection on us
[1:40:34] come on now
[1:40:36] a house it's not taken care of and
[1:40:39] abandoned you see all those little parts
[1:40:41] right there it may not seem spiritual
[1:40:43] but it's all part of the local body of
[1:40:47] Jesus Christ for one objective for the
[1:40:51] kingdom of God oh my let them make me a
[1:40:57] sanctuary let it be a place let our
[1:41:00] hearts be a place that he's welcome
[1:41:04] everytime we come together here let it
[1:41:06] be a place where he's welcome he said
[1:41:07] you know what I can't wait
[1:41:10] oh my they're coming together all mob
[1:41:12] hey they just welcomed me and they just
[1:41:14] you know they let me be myself

[1:41:54] all of his children we're not the only
[1:41:55] ones that have church on Thursday night

[1:42:01] loves to come here he's welcome how is
[1:42:08] he welcome let us make him a sanctuary
[1:42:11] let our lives be a place where the word
[1:42:15] is delivered or it might cut us in my
[1:42:17] correctness but remember as stones are
[1:42:20] no good unless they're shaped he comes
[1:42:24] to shape us mold us may our lives be
[1:42:27] found as a place that is receptive to
[1:42:30] him
[1:42:31] miss pray Heavenly Father Lord this
[1:42:39] thought tonight Lord God that you've
[1:42:45] laid on my heart of one body this is not
[1:42:48] something that would be new to our
[1:42:51] hearts Lord but I pray that tonight that
[1:42:55] Lord that for every one of us even as we
[1:42:58] revisit this part of it for Lord those
[1:43:02] that are our young among us in the faith
[1:43:08] and even those of us Lord that had been
[1:43:11] walking with you for some years these
[1:43:16] are things Lord God that how we need to
[1:43:20] be reminded Lord how we're thankful Lord
[1:43:24] God for the body of Jesus Christ we're
[1:43:29] so grateful Lord God for what you have
[1:43:32] done in our lives

[1:43:56] me do that we're just thankful Lord God
[1:44:02] of the reality in our hearts to know
[1:44:05] that we were included in Redemption Lord
[1:44:10] that the Dove has found a place in our
[1:44:13] lives to rest I pray Lord if there's one
[1:44:18] here tonight or streaming probably
[1:44:22] haven't fully committed their lives to
[1:44:25] you they might come here to this
[1:44:28] assembly they might come to another
