love you Lord Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord amen you love him he's so precious Lord is so good if you'll turn with me thank you musicians tonight turn with me to Hosea chapter 2 I want to just just pick up there tonight if the Lord will help us in verse 14 we'll read a few verses and then I'll let you be seated and we'll continue from there Hosea chapter 2 verse 14 therefore behold I will lure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her and I will give her her vineyards from thence the valley of Achor for doroth hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the days when she come up out of the land of Egypt and it shall be at that day saith the lord thou shalt call me a shine and shalt call me no more Bailey well I will take away the names of Balaam out of her mouth and they shall no more be remembered by their name amen may God bless you bless the reading of his words you being seated what a promise as we have been looking here Exodus 15 and we see God bringing Israel back into the homeland and God is going to fulfill the word that he spoke concerning her when we look at it here in the scriptures the just we could spend from now to eternity just just with scriptures that pertain to God bringing Israel home and God making himself known to Israel and we could see that but as we also look at it and as the Lord has been helping us we see that there is a great parallel that runs between that of Israel and the natural and seeing that they are are the people are the people of God or known as a nation and it runs a parallel with that of the Gentiles that being the elect that are taken out of the Gentiles for his namesake and the scripture it goes on and you find that just as it is and many of the other times of of the prophets here as it speaks it goes on to let it be known in verse 18 it breaks right into a scripture dealing with the Millennium and then that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground and I will break the bowl and the sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely and then the Lord here it comes back around and coming back into this of Israel and I want you just to notice these words that are spoken here in verses 19 and verse 20 and I will be truly speaking to Israel and I will betroth thee unto me forever yay I will be trow thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving-kindness and in mercies I will even be trophy unto me in faithfulness and Dow shall know the Lord and each one of these places here in the scriptures when we look here in these two verses this is the Lord's doing it is God that is bringing everything about for within Israel the same way that God has come and bringing things about to perform his word and calling out that of the elect of the Gentiles he goes on here in verse 21 it says and it shall come to pass in that day I will hear saith the Lord and I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear Jezreel which means the lord souls verse 23 here this is speaking of us of the gen Tiles taking a people for his namesake and i will show her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god when you look at the the whole in this scripture I don't know how that anyone could not read within these the scriptures here and really throughout the whole Bible and not see the grace of God even God's grace that he would lead us to make us to know when were wrong and would lead us you know as David said I had fainted unless I had seen the goodness of God of the Lord in the land of the living and the Bible tells us in the book of Romans that the goodness of the Lord leadeth us to repentance and to see that God's grace that if not for the grace of God that you and I would have still been in the state and the situation that we were in when he came and he found us but you see when we look at this in the scripture we find that God has already made a solling there's an election there is an elect as we've looked at it of a hundred forty-four thousand that is to come forth after the bride has been taken out of here in rapture and and and then we also see that down through here which has been hidden down through the the ages Israel did not know anything of other Church ages Israel did not know even though these little parts of like we read here in the closing part of Hosea Israel did not realize this nor see this coming about this was a hidden mystery remember how Paul would speak in Ephesians and Colossians and he would speak of that hidden mystery of the bride of Jesus Christ of how that you and I we were there with we were chosen in God's mind and how that God Himself would choose how bright unto himself and then how that he would make himself known he would give his life and then we find the great parallel of how that through that of like what took place in the Garden of Eden that out of his side he would take for it the very elements that's which would make up his bride which would be his wife the Lambs wife as we know it and we realized that we're living in a time right now when we see things all around us I think of how that when brother Anna would say you know in them different places and the message clear from the earlier times and then as it continues to move on up you know even into recognizing it's day and it's 65 and brother and wouldn't would say you know he says I ignored 64 sorry he says I don't see you know anything else left but then the coming of the Lord we're in that but the bride is taken out in rapture and then that of the two witnesses that would set up on the earth to call out the 144,000 and to see where that we are in this time remember that even brother Branham himself in the earlier times when they had sent down Bibles there to the Jews and the Jews were reading those Bibles that were synched to him and said if he is the Messiah let him come and let it and let him prove himself and to see how endure the random himself was ready he had the ticket he already went to Cairo you know and here he was standing at Cairo Egypt and he's standing there and he says you know I've already come this far I might as well go the rest of the way but to see how that God would get the attention of his servant to wear that you know the Lord would tell him this is not yet this is not your part and they even we're to think of this now to where even brother Branham would make a statement here he where he says I've always this was an earlier part before the seals were ever opened he says I've always believed that I would have a part within them but yet we recognize that even has God would continue to open the word that the Prophet himself would come around even in questions and answers and said on the seals and tell us and say God will not anoint a Gentile and send a Gentile prophet to the Jews it will be then of the Jews that God will raise up for he'll always speak to the Jews by the Jews and he speaks to the Gentiles he said he will not raise up a Jewish prophet to speak to the Gentiles the Jew God will raise up a Gentile prophet and to see that how that God has so made everything arranged everything it's such a tremendous way to think that even how the Prophet would have that of an inclination in that moment it shows you and I trust it does to where that we are truly living in the time of the coming of the Lord we are looking for that literal corporal coming of the Lord Jesus Christ we are awaiting for that because the Holy Spirit and I think of this now the Holy Spirit wearing that he has come in our lives and that's what prepares us and brings us to the watching and waiting of his literal corporal coming and that's what believers believe we're waiting for that we're looking for that and to realize that there are these things that where you and I are standing and how that the world and even when I would say world I would say that much of even Chris to them is looking for the coming of the Lord but yet they're looking for it in their way and to realize that the coming of the Lord is that which is revealed for revealed sovereignly by God to his people because God will not allow one of his children to be caught off guard the coming of the Lord Paul would say it like this he said you are children of the day he said I need not write unto you concerning this you are children of the line you know that day is approaching how because within our lives it is something to wear we're not just looking for event so I take for example the world you know when things have happened within the world like when we had 9/11 and so forth I would say I never looked it up but I would say church attendance sparked within that time there were people that started to pray that never prayed before he was like you know one time when we were on our way the one time I went to Honduras for the bill brother heard we were in the plane and we were just took off from tickle Zacapa and we were just flying to San Pedro Sula and when we were on the way that plane there was a big old crack in that plane I mean it just said bang and we thought you know and and it means that time you know all you seen beads come out people started praying because really you didn't know I mean it was loud it was a loud crack but you see within it there you know our lives when we are prepared for his coming now just listen to me now when we are prepared for his coming we are living every moment we are looking for his coming for him to come it's not something that we look at and say oh well it seems like this event is fading because even now you find that we're people themselves where they had stepped with the fervency and you know started to attend church and we know it's more than that but it just goes to show they really it is not about the coming of the Lord they're not really living for him are you with me it's just simply when something has come about and you know they they hear fear and and they move within it but my point within this is that God makes known hears his way of preparation that you and I might be ready when he himself does appear now when they think of this here Paul would would bring this up concerning Israel and in Israel and in Romans 11:25 Paul would say brethren you know I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in so there is a space of time that God is dealing with the Gentiles just like it was stated there even in the the Gospels I believe it's Luke 24 where it speaks that how that the cities shall be trodden down until the fullness of the Gentiles come in and to know that there is there is a timing that God would deal and allow blindness to come to Israel now I'll say it like this same God that allowed blindness to come to Israel we are living in an age that is naked wretched and blind and don't know it you see it is the parallel the repeating here of where there was a blindness and then their fall turned to our salvation and now you find to where the finishing up of the Gentiles here the final outpouring of the Holy Spirit the finishing of the mystery of God the completing of that of his redeemable attributes that make up his bride and wants that he himself that last name where it has been splashed with in that Clorox bleach then he himself he comes to take us home with him to the wedding supper and then the two witnesses step on the scene for Israel so all of this is in God's timing and to think of this God's got all of this arranged every bit of it arranged verse 26 and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel Paul said they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes don't you love that God never he never in many places within the Scriptures that God would make known that I cannot forget Israel now remember here bringing Israel into the place and the finishing and fulfillment of the work is the magnifying and lifting up of his name so when we look at this of how that God not want you to think of this when they were on this journey remember each time when they were on this journey even in the times when God would tell Moses step aside Moses because I will smite I will slay every one of them and I'll raise up a new nation but the Spirit of Christ within Moses it reached out for the promise and says nay Lord don't do that Lord it stands in intercession for them notice how Moses even throughout those times would say if you do that then the nations themselves will raise up and say you were not able to bring them in and though it might look like around and among the nations and it would seem like that even after the rejection of the Messiah and Israel is scattered but God has not forgotten his word the Bible tells it like this I believe it's Isaiah 26 that he has not forgotten his word he waters it day and night it is a prompt limit just saying like this this promise you think that you get a promise on your heart and you take that promise let me tell you something God has had his word always before him his word is upon his mind his word is upon his heart his mind is on his word he has not forgotten one promise hallelujah even when he the mighty angel descends there in revelations 10 it is a rainbow about his head he's got his mind on his covenant think of this here how that Paul would further go into this and bringing it together with you and I he goes into 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 and says you know concerning with Moses and verse 13 he put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for unto this day remain at the same vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which veil is done away in Christ so even though they read the Old Testament and the Old Testament holds within it the prophecies of the Messiah they read that they knew that now think of it here the Lord Jesus being the capping there of that Old Testament and now the life that was within the bridegroom is poured out and he gathers to himself a bride and the capping of that is his life himself personally identified within his bride and to think aware that this is within this time into a place to where it doesn't matter how much that they read the Old Testament and they know that but there is a veil that's upon their hearts and that veil can only be taken away by the Lord Himself it doesn't matter all of the words that they can put together steady and everything else it's not steadying that brings the word to life it takes the author himself to bring the word to life that's why when they heard the Lord Jesus they said never a man spake like this it was not that they never heard what he was saying they knew what it was never a man spake like this this man in speaking like the rest of them it was an authority you know why because that word he in that word were one and the same he was united with it and it was the presence of God that was a company that word he was not just reading something of which he himself was not a partaker of and of something that was separate from him but he and the way were one in the same and that's the same way it is with every true believer born of the Spirit of God when you ER dwelling in that word we are not saying something or doing something that is contrary to that word but it is the expression of our lives so the veil itself no matter how much a person could do they can never take that veil away what does it the grace of God but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away so it requires then it's God that will come the Lord through his word that he has promised and has his presence is moving in it will be the very Lord Himself that will actually turn the hearts of that of the elect of God you see many are reading that of the Old Testament but God himself knows there are those ordained who actually there's a veil upon their heart and there's little unis like now there is a hunger in their heart you know God begins to speak this down through the prophets you find it in Isaiah in Ezekiel in Jeremiah to where that there is a longing that stirs up even in that of the 144,000 and it's not even a knowledge of what am I longing for that don't even understand that you know even in the type that is sent when Israel was taken into captivity for 70 years yet God would reveal even there to Daniel of the captivity from even that time when the Gentile kingdom would set in there would never kanessa and how that through those times of not just 270 years but now those seventy weeks that are appointed there to the Jews of how that God would make known to Daniel there of how that he was going to deal with his people and God made these things known to Daniel and when God made it known to Daniel remember what Daniel said I then understood by the books you with me I understood by the books and the Prophet would take it up like this and said you know brother M says now we understand it by the Book of Daniel by the Book of Jeremiah by the Book of Isaiah by the book of James by the Book of Luke see it's a it's an all unfolding of the Lamb's Book of Life it all points to the goal to the achievement it points to the mystery of his coming because remember he's coming back for you and I and as he takes us away when we are there he will slip away and come back and make himself known to that of the hundred forty-four thousand and then he brings us back with him there riding upon those white horses there here we come riding down for that Battle of Armageddon before the Millennium ever sets in it is that that of how that God Himself is making himself and his word known in this hour and we realized this right here if we come back to this it takes God to take away the veil to see in our own lives you and I could read the scriptures but yet it takes God to come and remove the veil I won't ask you tonight but there's no doubt there's things that you and I can both read and there's things that we don't fully understand I'll tell you this right here I've been studying this too you know I'll call sorts of hours of the day of studying this of how he just broke but all sorts of time and I still come to a place and say where do I go when I go yeah it's something that within it there is so much of things that would break and we're looking at it and you know when we see these things it still takes God to open that you know hidden up to us to apply into it remember remember now the crowbar on the mountain was not a man using his strength to pry it off it was God giving provided timing and season for the light now to shine upon that if there's any strength to open the word it is not the strength of man because a man can pull back the lids of the book but it takes a lamb to break the seals from off of our eyes that you and I might clearly see so this is a work of the Lamb himself to actually turn the heart you know this is what God works with first he works with and he deals with our heart many times how God is dealing this is how he deals with all of us how he's brought all of us to where we are God deals with our heart you know God's field deals with our heart God will drop something on our heart and we'll take that we'll pray over it meditate over it and we realize God will give me the answer for that right there when I have need of it door you won't miss it because when you place it like that then if it's something you're reading you're hearing you're listening to the unction of the Holy Spirit will move right back around and bring whatsoever he has said back to your remembrance that is a working of the Spirit of Truth so when we look at this boy it just takes away there there shouldn't be any anxiety if there's something you don't understand put it before the Lord and watch God move on that behalf to you personally so there's a gathering we see that has been going on we have looked at that here for the past a couple times together there's a gathering that's going on remember all Israel remember the scriptures all Israel is not Israel all these rails not Israel there's an elected four to four thousand coming back into the land you know brother Brandon would even make a statement there in in Daniel seventy weeks and even even in beeban prior to that brother Graham would talk about he said surely he said there's 144,000 now and you you you know you and I would look at that statement but when you go back and look in history and when Israel themselves became a nation they're in in May and 1948 you realize that just within a short period of time Israel went from just I think it was a number you know close to 200,000 or 300,000 if we clear up into 800,000 just like that within just more just just a few years and you look at what was taking place then and look at what has been happening you know these things unless you keep up with it these things have already been taking place there's people organizations that sponsor called operation Exodus that's just one of many that actually gather in Jews and you know everything is set up so that their trip back home their one-way ticket all of that is put in place you say who is it that would give them the unction to do that friends it's the unction of the Holy Spirit for that hour now you might look at it and say I'm but you know that don't mean that everybody that takes that one-way ticket that they are part of that elect 144,000 no they may not be but they may have a child that is you see God knows what he's doing even when all the Israel came up out of the land of Egypt when glob was delivering Israel from Egypt there he was calling them out of Egypt just like you'll be calling them out of that Roman system there and those two witnesses how that God will move with him that time and to think of how that they came up out of there there was a mixed multitude when pressures came who caved the mixed multitude who was it that complained the mixed multitude I can tell you right now when you look at the amount of people who's coming back into Israel and you see them when they're getting off the planes now the flags are waving I think it's a wonderful thing you hear them singing the songs they're welcoming them but yet you realize that as they're coming back in there you look at that and you say when this word starts dropping it's going to start bringing folks in line it's going to Clark calls them in the street now they're going to have to wash their face they're going to have to change their clothes they're going to have to get right before God they're gonna have to want to line up with that word now you know it's just like this I've been in some times you know in preaching meetings for things and sometimes where there's been situations that people came and they came for the wrong reasons and then you know as as the Lord would move and they came for a wrong reason but yet after a period of time here the Lord would deal with something in a service and here they come and they stand right there you know and they'll say you know brother Samuel I did not come to this meeting for the right purpose I came you know to meet or whatever more but God has dealt with my heart in this service I want to surrender my life I want to rededicate my life to God man you know what if you're out looking at that and we knew about that young man or young lady and they were coming to that service you and I might look at it and say they ain't gonna get nothing out of it but you see this is where that God's ways are so much greater than our ways it's to trust the Living God because when you look at some of the interviews that they do with these people who are returning back some of them just say you know what there is no hope for me here in France there's no hope for me here I want my children you know to grow up in safety and there are things that they are looking at and there and there's mentioning but you know within it God knows who belongs to him he already knows that amen even when we had said the preparation for those who went before back in the land that was necessary it was necessary that the land start my mama I'm just gonna go with this tonight it's necessary that the land start being occupied it was necessary that desert places start being occupied it was necessary you know why that was necessary because there was gonna be more coming and you know this is where you and I are it was necessary that these parts of the word be occupied it ought to be where you and I can look at it now and say mine I see it like I never seen it before thank God you know what that is it's land that was occupied and now the land itself is beginning to bring forth and produce and you know what if God Terri's longer some of you as young people sitting right here and as God would Terry you'll be able to say a year from now few years from now say my goodness it's become even more clear why it's land that belongs to us this scriptural and baptism of the Holy Ghost it belongs to us there are repeater god hallelujah so to think how that when they came up out of Egypt there was a mixed multitude no doubt various a mixed multitude with the masses of people that are coming in there and we know that when we look at it we see also where Israel was drove back into that land a national force even as it is so right now many of them the reason that they're uprooting is because of national pressure that's come upon them they no longer feel at home you see it was Pharaoh that finally told them get out now you find how that pressures come in there that's exactly where we're heading to for the rapture to where the world finally says get out of here you see this is where the laws like you've spoken in the Book of Daniel he calls it laws to be passed and so forth that spirit that's behind that's motivating the governments of the world what is it all he cannot do anything unless God would first permitting there are laws that's on the books that's never been enforced all it takes for somebody to enforce them but you know what nothing can be done until every child of God has been sealed away [Applause] you already the God think about it when even there the world were one it broke out all of a sudden here the war it stops nobody knows what happened it wasn't a coincidence 11th month 11th day 11th hour that's God the world would call it coincidence but we call it God it was God signifying that before this earth can be cleaned off and prepared for the Millennium and I have got to take my bride in rapture and I must seal my servants 144,000 so no wonder in Revelation 7 is sent back to the four winds hold back the Wars and strife until I have sealed 144,000 you see God will not allow anything to happen not one word will be defeated it will not be listen to me there will not be one hide nor hoof left behind when they want and Moses to leave Egypt and leave your children behind leave your livestock behind but Moses said we're taking everyone with us I'll tell you this is the power of acclaiming revelation when you get that revelation it's an absolute in your heart it strains your life when you realize there's a power that's greater than me on the inside and that power has taken ahold of you it has released the attributes son and daughter of God on the inside and you realize that same power that there is not a prevailing power that can withstand that of the revelation of Jesus Christ and you stand there upon that word and you claim your children [Applause] if you don't claim of who will and know how you train them is by the confidence that you have within what God has done in your life all through this building right here no doubt there's many of us that we would have been wrote off friends and everything else said that God's past hold the girls past hope that's true when it came to earthly matters but nothing is impossible with God nothing you tell them mom and daddy of the prodigal son you tell them quit pray whether they had a reality it didn't matter if half the estate was gone it didn't matter they remain they held on to that that is my son you think they didn't stand there and quote the word no children are in heritage of the Lord you think they didn't quote that word come on somebody you know brother branham tells us concerning when Elijah girls angels were on the mountain you know brother Ram tells us Elijah didn't see those angels when he said there's more with us than there is with Sam he said Amy said what it was he'll I sure held the word up that they're angels of God are encamped about them that fear him he put his trust in the world of the Lord he knew God said it but here they're here God's Word it's a solid solid place to stand [Music] on the ground is sinking samba his word it's solid nations can shake the world can shake the earth can shake but he does not shake Oh glory for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead we were once dead in sin and trespasses but what happened but he quickened us he raised us not one of us were seeking for him but say me there was some longing within me that's because he put that longing in you [Applause] go her to be to God yes sir to think of this what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the first-fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches and Hosea 6:1 come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after two days he will revive us in the third day we we will raise us up and we shall live in his sight come let us return unto the Lord who is it it's God drawing Israel to return the same God that has thrown you and I the same God it pulls on our hearts even so come quickly Lord Jesus is God pooling on her heart and notice after two days after two thousand years he will revive us he he will revive us he will remove the veil he turns our hearts I will be trophy unto me I will make myself known unto thee and we shall live in his sight have eternal life oh my notice here in the Book of Ezekiel we'll just see how far we get here tonight but in the Book of Ezekiel here the scripture makes no the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of boys and caused me to pass by them roundabout and behold there were very many in the open valley hello they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live notice son of man prophet and I answered Oh Lord God thou knowest can they live again thou knowest what a sight a valley of dry bones no doubt many of us have never come into any place where we saw bones scattered around like that sometimes I know when you you know at times when we hunted out there I think one time was something with brother herb out there off Jones Road and I was out there and you know light and stuff begin to break and I looked around there and I was sitting in bones I thought what in the world is all around me here it was nothing but what must have been with them cows they took him and slaughtered him there in the edge of that woods it was setting around bones you know looking at a bunch of bones don't look real good you with me it don't look real good so when we look at this here how that blood brings him into a situation that it would look like and seemed entirely hopeless and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them all ye dry bones hear the word of the Lord so evidently these bones can hear and God knows bacon here and God knows what they can hear and will respond to is the word of the Lord coming through son of man it will it will actually in loose and that they're able to hear the word thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and I will lay sinews upon you and bring you up flesh upon you and cover you a skin and put breath in you and ye shall live you shall know that I am the Lord notice I will I will I will I will I will and you shall know that i am the lord why because it is him knowing that our lives are not the work of man our lives are the work of the Lord God every one of us is children of God we were just like these bones bones yes bones we were ordained brother Doug as parts of his body we did not know that we were ordained parts of the body of Jesus Christ but he knew where you at bones [Applause] just like he knew where the hundred forty-four thousand he knows where they're at no doubt there's a lot of dirt where the word is spoken but the word came for the bones come on somebody the dirt gets hot from the Sun the rock gets hot from the Sun but the seed on the inside says oh thank you Father thank you Father it's warming me up now notice this so I prophesied as I was commanded so let me get this straight son of man he prophesized as he's commanded and God comes behind the word and performs his own word so then who gets the glory he does the Son of Man just happens to be one who's in contact with God that God can make his word known to and speak his word through for surely the Lord will not do anything except he revealed first his word to his servants the prophets oh my so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise or he and the hold of shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone in that incredible brother a you didn't have to say hey femur bone I want you to join up with this bone hey hey you listen listen no no no no no you need to be right over here hey hey brother they no no no not right there you are in an amazing the world holds the mystery and the order and positioning of our lives in the body of Jesus Christ just as the word itself the name being revealed and going forth positionally places us in Jesus Christ that's the same way it is for Israel the word when it's spoken brother it's not the intelligence of a man it's the intelligence of Almighty God that same intelligence that operates even the very cells of our body what tells the liver cell to go to the liver what tells the kidneys sale go to the kidney what does that brother had them what tales along sell to go to a lung sale who does that it's an ordained placement even in our natural body God shows positioning and placement for a better God and when I beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy on a man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live [Applause] what's happening the world is transforming this situation that's exactly what God has done and is doing in our life it's the same thing that God Himself will do and is doing for Israel I won't ask you to raise your hand because everyone does have both hands up and our feet up to where but we're all many times we get impatient and brother dynam gives such wonderful counsel in the beginning of power transformation and he says when God says something he will bring it to pass he said now for you and I many times we get impatient we can't see growth like we like to see it we can't see certain things and we get impatient but what he said he said you stay with that word he said even if it's a word that come to you he said in the man that preached it to you that man may no longer stand for God whatsoever he said it wasn't a man's word that transforms you it was God's Word it wasn't the man it was God glory be to God you see this is the confidence that I have I have confidence within this word this message preaching this living reality that it will bring the change in hearts I know sometimes he's got a correctness he's got to skin us down by we thank God for that but let me tell you something friends it's got to take a word that's able to override and on the inside to where it brings about a change to where you and I can see and we receive strength verse 10 let me try to get through this so I prophesied has he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up on their feet and exceeding great army so notice a little bit brother bill would be prophesied and then things would take place and then here the Lord would come along and he would tell son of man this is what you need to do okay so he would do that and then here this is what you need to do and then he would do that you see everything itself is a work of the Lord it wasn't just good enough to have bones come together but he had to actually bring all the ligaments tendons sinews flesh all of those things had to actually come into its position and then life would have to enter into that body looks like a pretty hopeless situation if we're just looking at it ourselves but God specializes in taking dry bones then he said unto me verse 11 son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God behold o my people glorious joy to God I feel like getting another language right now notice what they're saying I hope is cut off what hope is there do you realize when we look at things in our own strength that's exactly how it looks to you and I but remember when I said thus saith the Lord behold my people oh that phrase is a powerful phrase behold o my people not just anybody my people I will open your graves and tells you to come up out of your graves from the nation's and bring you into the land of the Israel in amazing it's like blindnesses over the whole earth almost they don't even realize what's going on they don't know what's taking place even what has been happening and if not for the grace of God we wouldn't either verse 13 and ye shall know that I am the Lord you shall know no no question you will know that I am the Lord when I have opened your grace o my people and brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall you know that I the LORD have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord can you imagine when the Israel stands there has God deals with their life The Fountains open for him then the Lamb himself steps forward the word does not diminish it becomes more real real that it is the Lord that has done this if not for the mercies of the Lord gathering us in we would still be scattered we would still be scattered we would still be in our graves but God have a promise he would take the maturity of the word in this hour and wave it over a people there to call us out of dock denominationalism and bring us to himself when you and I were back there we didn't know how to get out I know I wasn't in maybe a stained-glass prison but I was in a prison among first nature I needed deliverance you need a deliverance I set around this message I heard it I could quote it but I knew I didn't have the reality in my soul but there was something that rose up and what it was it was designed and how God journey and God's wrong there were bars brother Carlos we couldn't get out of those bars but the word of the Lord was spoken house of Hale give way in the name of Jesus Christ behold o my people I have brought you out of grace bringing you back to myself Oh Lord throw it eater god hallelu I'm glad he's in control you don't know what to say I don't know what to say but he can say speak this say this do this it's his body that's yielded to him and then as we yield to that it's not us it's him it's him doing the work look at this as we close here we'll just stop here tonight no doubt within every one of us there's been times of things where there's been divisions that's come up divisions sometimes in a church division among families you know the realities of it is as much as we try and we work with things and you know you can't do it by the instrumentality of man just trust me okay if you've never tried it trust me it'll backfire on you now that's not putting anybody down it's you know what it all comes down to it's God's timing it's God's timing it's not ranging things together you know like you get kids out there on a playground you say tell Johnny you're sorry time you didn't mean to hit him in the head with that kickball sorry he said it but he didn't say it you with me even though we know that's the right thing to do we teach our children we worked through all those saints but you see God wants it from our heart got this and like divisions he doesn't he was spoken in the body I don't like schisms I don't like things that divide but I like he God's desire is for his people to be one but not oneness by that of man that's the one that's a man but God one loves his people to be one with him when we are one with him it'll take care it'll work being one with one another you with me it'll work that way now to think of this so we're here we are standing in this moment I really am I'm closing I'm not gonna go any further than this but to look at how that times there's not one of us not one person in here whether it's been on your job whether it's been your home church wherever more nobody likes division and we should the same that's a co-worker it still should be something in your heart that you do not sanction division this is not in my notes a reference as far as the scriptures but this is just exactly what he's given me right now division itself we know it's not of God so in order to combat that we cannot combat it with earthly measures the only way then we can come against division is with divine love that's the only way it can be done now to think of this here is to the houses of Israel remember when Solomon himself as his heart was departing from God and God had raised up and let it be known through Rio balm that the kingdom would be separated there would be better the ten tribes that would go and then you know you would have that of the tribe that would be here that are Judah and how that this division would come about but yet God himself has already made a promise he will bring that division and bring that healing among them and to realize even how God will do it even in the book of Zechariah believe it Araya 12 verse 8 or something of even how that he will save the tents of Judah first of how that God will so set everything in such a divine order so that one does not rise up against the other God still maintains my order and then when you come into this time of Israel it's not going to be 10 tribes over here and one tribe over there it is going to be recognized as the nation of Israel it will not be a separated group of tribes but how can this be done it will be done by the love of God pouring into the hearts of the elect children of God and as what is it doing it's God Himself moving down and as they're yielding they're uniting with him and as they are uniting with him his name is being reflected and manifested through them and it actually brings unity because the focus is not upon one another the focus is upon here sometimes this is where we get in trouble we focus on the division instead of focusing on the healer sometimes we try to make things come together and we're working and we get frustrated let's just be honest you get frustrated because if you have review every bit of a good intentions and what you try to do it looks like it just backfired right back on you but you know what it is it's God wanting us to trust him this church is his work and the Imams will say like this you might as well say I'm his work my family is his work because it isn't just me taking a word and saying but I almost straight in this situation out that fire you know backfire on you but instead of looking at the word and praying over it and say God let my heart be so right and prepare the heart Lord because after all in order to bring about division in order to resolve that and bring unity it's got to begin right here with a long longing I'm longing to be United and the logging to be United supersedes all of these little concerns and I say little I know sometimes I sing big but in reality when we get to looking at his presence and him we realize you know what that ain't nothing you let somebody brother Brandon tells us in the message he said you let something happen he said you might have something maybe in your heart he said that you let something happen he said maybe the brother Neville ordered this brother he said Oh mine you watched that brotherly love raise up it's something that raises up within us brother Branham told us he said he'll punch at you he'll punch at you and try to make you have different feelings but keep them and take them before the Lord Lord let my focus be on you if our focus is upon him then he will direct us or you or me and you know what it does it allows him to flow through and take what he shows in Ezekiel in these scriptures he had two sticks one stick was Ephraim 10 tribes of Israel another one Joseph represents Judah and he said that write the names upon that stick and he said you make them one stick now you tell me brother Carlos how you got two sticks and you make one stick out of two sticks I'll tell you what it you ain't gonna do with duct tape flex tape Gorilla Tape whatever more it's gonna take a union with God it'll take a union by the Holy Ghost I'll tell you God can repair things that are ripped that which is torn that which is broken our God means means the broken heart I've got heels divisions and they just let me just stop here and read this to you you love the Lord Ezekiel 37 verse 21 thus saith the Lord God this is what I want you to say into them thus saith the Lord God behold I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen whether they be gone and I will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel and one King shall be king to them all this is breaking over into the Millennium and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions but I will save them out of all their dwelling places whether they have sinned and will cleanse them so that they shall be my people and I will be their God his working we are his working he has brought us out of the greaves he has brought us unto himself it's him that heals namin words known throughout the scripture the division between the knee of the tribes of Israel but to see the Spirit of God moving down you know what it shows when this happens it's close to him making himself known to them and what does it mean for us when walls are taken down love for one another the revealing of him to you and I all it creates a love in our hearts for one another you know what it does as we get the focusing on him it brings cleansing it brings cleansing to our lives and you find look what happened with Union Union is a result of every other thing else that defiles is being removed idols taken now hey man thoughts ideas anything that's hindering he's cleansing us he's cleansing us he's cleansing us with the same water that he has sprinkle upon them when he brings him back home being washed by the water of the word glory be to God brother Dave this is his work this is his work this is what he's doing aren't you glad or Jesus or God how we thank you we look into these precious words or Jesus we find ourselves we see your grace we see your mercy to our lives or Jesus just as you brought us to yourself you brought Israel and Lord is Israel there in the land I believe it just any moment will be gone and those two witnesses the Spirit of God will come down upon them the characteristics of Moses and Elijah will be made manifest every part of this great music sheet is being sent it's already been rode out it's preparing the Lord God as you would gather is real back alone so are you gathering yet sons and daughters of God you're bringing us back

literal blood or body and that that one that one was a literal blood and he said that Luther was able to look beyond that and see Jesus Christ exalted and said the just shall live by faith how powerful words can be Luther stood up under inspiration no sir you're not reducing my Jesus to accrete you're not reducing my Jesus to a wafer and a glass of wine no sir but Luther was able to get a glimpse a glimpse a glimpse of the atonement and he said the just shall live by faith Wesleyan spot you got a glimpse there sanctifying power in the atonement nor does it kept moving into the hour
