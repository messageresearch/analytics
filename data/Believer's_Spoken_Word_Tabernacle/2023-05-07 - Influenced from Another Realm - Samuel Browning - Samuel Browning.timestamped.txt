[35:59] meetings brother Nathan Bryant will be
[36:01] here with us and you've seen the
[36:03] announcement there on the board and did
[36:05] they make the announcement there'll be a
[36:07] uh meeting after they made that
[36:09] announcement okay for the Sisters to
[36:11] meet in the back conference room
[36:14] um so that will take place uh I want to
[36:19] just have a special prayer here in a
[36:21] moment for my father-in-law
[36:23] um
[36:24] brother Bill had mentioned it and um
[36:27] you know uh where he's uh facing open
[36:31] heart surgery here on Wednesday morning
[36:33] correct
[36:34] so Wednesday morning and you know we
[36:39] when he came up here well when they
[36:42] moved up here I should say and there in
[36:44] in 2020.
[36:47] you know there's things that when he
[36:50] came up here and he was with our doctor
[36:52] and so forth there's certain things that
[36:54] the doctors begin to kind of they begin
[36:56] to pick up on certain things and that
[36:58] was first of all with kidneys
[37:00] and um and you heard him give the
[37:03] testimony before because they had said
[37:05] his his kidneys were not real good or
[37:07] where they were at as far as a stage but
[37:10] you know uh it was in September of uh
[37:13] was it September of 2020
[37:16] um I think it was brother Andrew was
[37:18] here ministering and um we were he had
[37:22] went to the doctor that week before and
[37:24] so forth they called him our doctor
[37:25] called him on a Sunday afternoon between
[37:27] services and and just told him said hey
[37:32] this is something that just doesn't
[37:34] happen his numbers either they went down
[37:37] or up whatever it was it was a good good
[37:39] thing as far as for the kidneys and so
[37:42] um you know then here just recently they
[37:45] um
[37:46] they had you know talked about some
[37:48] things they wanted to do some tests and
[37:49] so forth with his heart and and of
[37:52] course he don't mind me telling this
[37:53] you're part of the family you're going
[37:55] to get preached on but you know his
[37:57] whole thing is starting out you know
[37:58] sometimes we want to ignore things as
[38:00] though that if I ignore it it'll go away
[38:03] well
[38:04] no brother Branham even told us on how
[38:06] come overcome he says the doctor says
[38:07] you have cancer he says you don't say
[38:09] well no I don't have it no but the god
[38:11] in you is greater than the cancer
[38:14] because when we testify do we testify
[38:17] and say oh no the report was a lie the
[38:18] whole time no we testify and give glory
[38:20] to God why because we knew the report
[38:22] spoke truth
[38:24] but in US as a God who is greater than
[38:27] the circumstances
[38:29] so I was thankful when he uh relented
[38:32] and I did not have to go over and have
[38:34] any pastoral pressure or son-in-law
[38:37] Force upon him to get those tests we
[38:41] have a good relationship I love my
[38:43] in-laws
[38:44] and they tolerate me I'll say that
[38:48] but anyhow he went for that test and you
[38:51] know what the other day when they wanted
[38:53] to go in for the catheter and we had
[38:54] prayer there on Tuesday and I just you
[38:58] know I've had a piece throughout it
[38:59] throughout the time and and the peace
[39:01] you know you understand what I'm saying
[39:03] sometimes when you have peace it's not
[39:05] that I have a word from the Lord that
[39:06] this is how this is going to be it's
[39:08] just it's a piece I I don't know the
[39:09] outcome because sometimes when we have a
[39:12] piece and we we even have thoughts
[39:13] sometimes on how we want things maybe or
[39:15] men would like to hear it go this way we
[39:18] all do that right and
[39:21] um so but anyhow when the news came you
[39:24] know that it was going to have to have
[39:25] the open heart surgery
[39:27] you know you say brother Sammy where we
[39:29] at well I was just at peace because I
[39:30] know it was there was peace all along
[39:32] and I'm just thankful what I'm thankful
[39:34] for
[39:35] as I told him the other day I said I'm
[39:37] grateful how God so all how God so
[39:40] sovereignly moved everything because if
[39:42] you had been living still where you were
[39:44] there were things not being picked up
[39:46] and attended to like they needed to be
[39:49] so I thank God brother bam called
[39:51] doctors God's agents
[39:55] called him God's agent so I I know you
[39:57] know it's just like there's you know
[39:59] people want to talk about doctors and
[40:01] police officers and teachers in fact we
[40:03] could bring it all across the board
[40:05] you know waiters waitress all across
[40:07] there's there's always good and there's
[40:09] bad
[40:11] but you know I mean you don't you don't
[40:12] say I had a bad waiter I never go into
[40:14] another restaurant
[40:17] okay
[40:19] but anyhow you know and I think the
[40:21] doctor was a good doctor but you know
[40:23] I'm just God has everything in his in
[40:24] his purpose and so I just we want to
[40:27] have prayer for him and I don't mean to
[40:29] take up so much time I would do it for
[40:31] anyone because I've done that but I want
[40:33] us just to have a special prayer
[40:35] amen and just to pray over brother Tommy
[40:40] and I want you to also pray from a
[40:42] mother-in-law as well it's also a a
[40:44] great time as well
[40:46] we could understand that you know from
[40:49] that realm of a spouse where there can
[40:51] be a a lot of nervousness within it as
[40:54] you go into it but I'm just going to ask
[40:56] that we just join our hearts together
[40:59] that not only God will just be present
[41:01] there too direct the surgeon and all of
[41:05] that team and I believe he will but I'm
[41:08] asking that he'll just come in such a
[41:10] way to give them just such a
[41:12] arrest even in these next few days and
[41:15] of course I think my father-in-law gave
[41:17] you that testimony and how the Lord just
[41:19] spoke to his heart and and I tell you
[41:21] when they told me that the other night
[41:23] at the house I just started having a
[41:25] time you know I just it's just so
[41:28] wonderful you know I rejoice when you
[41:30] hear God bless his people it's just
[41:32] tremendous and so we want to just have
[41:36] special prayer amen for our brother and
[41:39] also for my mother-in-law that the God
[41:41] will just also just give her also I know
[41:45] she has a piece but you understand
[41:46] especially sisters you would understand
[41:48] that entering into this moment and I
[41:51] don't think anyone could probably enter
[41:52] into it as well as you could to enter in
[41:54] for prayer for her in this time as well
[41:56] so
[41:57] uh if we could I'd like to have a
[42:00] brother Tommy just come on and um
[42:02] musicians thank you this morning God
[42:04] bless you
[42:06] um Brothers I'd like the brothers to

[45:07] oh
[45:08] amen
[45:10] let's um if we could let's we'll stand
[45:14] and want to read the word of the Lord I
[45:16] want to say God bless you
[45:19] amen
[45:26] I want to go to Hebrews chapter 11.
[45:30] and verse 23
[45:33] is where I'd like to
[45:35] read from here
[45:42] and we were speaking about getting into
[45:45] that place last week of being anointed
[45:48] to serve the purpose of God and we
[45:51] begin to speak about Moses and I want to
[45:55] speak a little bit more if the Lord will
[45:57] help us this morning on this
[45:59] on this part of it with Moses
[46:02] but I'd like to take the thought and
[46:04] just pray the Lord will help us this
[46:06] morning that it would be a a real
[46:08] blessing and an edification or things
[46:11] that God has just spoken touched my
[46:14] heart in looking and coming into this
[46:16] here and we want to just let the Lord
[46:19] just ask that he'll have his way amen I
[46:22] want to just speak on that thought of
[46:24] influenced from another Realm
[46:28] in Hebrews 11 23 by faith Moses when he
[46:32] was born was hid three months of his
[46:35] parents because they saw he was a proper
[46:39] child and they were not afraid of the
[46:41] king's commandment
[46:43] by faith Moses when he was come to yours
[46:46] refused to be called the son of
[46:49] Pharaoh's daughter
[46:50] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[46:53] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[46:57] pleasures of sin for a season
[47:00] is steaming the reproach of Christ
[47:03] greater riches than the treasures in
[47:06] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[47:10] recompense of the reward
[47:12] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[47:16] the Wrath of the king for he endured as
[47:19] seeing him who is invisible
[47:22] through faith he kept the Passover and
[47:26] the sprinkling of blood lest he that
[47:28] destroyed the firstborn should touch
[47:31] them and by faith they passed through
[47:33] the Red Sea as by dry land which the
[47:36] Egyptians are saying to do were drowned
[47:41] and I just I want to just read this
[47:44] little quote here a portion taking out
[47:46] we referred to it last week but it's one
[47:49] of those quotes that just as one of us
[47:51] something just to really chew on
[47:55] brother Brown says this and why Christ
[47:56] speak
[47:58] and he breaks in on this with talking
[48:00] about Moses and he says God has got a
[48:02] purpose
[48:03] of you being here
[48:05] if you can only be or get to that place
[48:08] how much trouble
[48:10] you save God and yourself too
[48:15] God's got a purpose
[48:17] now God's purpose I want to just say
[48:20] this before we begin
[48:22] God's purpose being revealed is not that
[48:26] you know every step of the way
[48:28] or even every Junction but God's purpose
[48:33] is that our lives would be yielded and
[48:37] surrendered to him
[48:40] because it's God knows
[48:43] what the purpose is and God is the one
[48:47] to fulfill that and achieve it through
[48:50] our lives as we'll yield to him
[48:53] so God's got a purpose
[48:55] and we just we're called just to yield
[48:57] to that may God bless you bless the
[48:58] reading of the word as you're being
[49:00] seated
[49:01] amen
[49:03] amen will you be in prayer this morning
[49:09] in second Corinthians 4 17 as we look at
[49:12] this point of influence from another
[49:15] Realm
[49:16] Paul says it like this for our light
[49:19] affliction
[49:21] and I say God
[49:23] I that's the place I want to get to is
[49:25] where I can call the tests and trials
[49:28] and things that comes light afflictions
[49:32] you hear what I said I said that's the
[49:34] place I want to get to
[49:35] I'm aiming there
[49:37] which is but for a moment now when Paul
[49:40] writing this he's not writing it to put
[49:42] himself above the people but remember
[49:45] this is the spirit of God that's coming
[49:47] down through
[49:48] a mortal that has met God face to face
[49:52] and these words are meant to capture our
[49:56] hearts that we can then look at things
[49:59] correctly that we see before us or that
[50:02] we're experiencing that in reality even
[50:05] when things seem as though they are
[50:07] going to overwhelm you or you may feel
[50:10] overwhelmed
[50:11] David said when my heart was overwhelmed
[50:14] lead me to the Rock that's higher than I
[50:19] for thou has been a shelter for me so
[50:21] this is the holy spirit calling us to
[50:25] recognize this is a light Affliction
[50:27] which is but for
[50:30] a moment
[50:32] but it worketh for us a far more
[50:36] exceeding an eternal weight of Glory
[50:41] how many know that the tests and trials
[50:43] that we go through as a Believer is what
[50:46] actually molds and shapes your character
[50:49] even where you're at in your journey
[50:52] because the Bible tells us that that all
[50:54] the way in Proverbs and Paul picks it up
[50:56] in Hebrews that there is no one no son
[51:00] cometh unto God but he is chastened he
[51:03] is tried and God deals with our hearts
[51:06] and the Bible says if we endure
[51:10] chastening then God deals with us as
[51:13] Sons
[51:15] so there's always there's tests that are
[51:18] always placed before us but I pray that
[51:21] God would help us to have this kind of a
[51:23] sight that where we can look at the
[51:26] things that are before us and say that's
[51:28] only for a moment
[51:30] if we can just look at the test or trial
[51:33] and recognize them just just say it in
[51:35] that way this is just a moment
[51:38] but the same sometimes there's been
[51:40] things that I've went through for a
[51:42] month or a month it's just a moment
[51:44] if we can just I'm not making light of
[51:46] that you understand but if we can just
[51:48] say this is for a moment to consider and
[51:51] weigh it against eternity
[51:54] no comparison Verse 18 while we look not
[52:00] at the things which are seen they're
[52:02] here before us
[52:04] we're not looking at them though and
[52:07] look means to where we become enamored
[52:10] or taken or occupied or our Mind's Eye
[52:14] everything is channeled into it we see
[52:16] them but but he says we are not looking
[52:20] at the things that are seen But at the
[52:23] things which are not seen
[52:26] for the things which are seen are
[52:30] temporal
[52:31] but the things which are not seen
[52:34] are eternal
[52:36] and I just say it like this when we
[52:38] consider the realm of influence and
[52:41] being influenced from another realm we
[52:45] realize that we are affected by the
[52:47] realm that we're born in
[52:50] and uh you know it's just like for
[52:53] example a person that is born in a
[52:56] certain country they begin to take on
[52:58] the customs and whatever of their
[52:59] country and certain things that will be
[53:01] done you know many times you've heard
[53:02] where there's been those that left here
[53:05] uh and they went over into another
[53:07] country and then they begin to take the
[53:09] ways of that country and they begin to
[53:11] be affected by the influence they were
[53:13] in right uh I think of it I'm just going
[53:16] to use your brother Joshua brother
[53:18] Joshua how many years you've been here
[53:19] now brother justway eight years but here
[53:23] just even a few years ago when he went
[53:25] back to his homeland there of Congo and
[53:28] I'm going to tell this he called me on
[53:31] the phone he had you know when he lived
[53:34] there you don't think about the driving
[53:35] how the driving's going on and some of
[53:37] you that's been in the third world
[53:38] countries you realize you know you just
[53:40] get in the car by faith
[53:44] and it's exactly right when he called he
[53:46] says I don't know I can do this you know
[53:48] looking at it right here and I said look
[53:50] I mean just give an example when I went
[53:52] to the other places Philippines or
[53:53] whatever I just tried to get in the back
[53:55] seat behind the seat so I don't see
[53:57] anything in front of me and I said one
[53:58] thing I'd do is say Lord this is as
[54:01] natural to them as us driving on the
[54:03] streets here
[54:04] and that's and that's how that I face it
[54:07] and I deal with it as well as to know
[54:09] that God has this therefore purpose so I
[54:11] want to just say that there are things
[54:13] that even like what brother Joshua he
[54:15] begin to be affected by the influence of
[54:17] how things are done here and the way you
[54:19] drive here sidewalks are not another
[54:21] place to drive on
[54:23] right I mean you know there's certain
[54:25] things and you you begin listen you know
[54:27] what I'm talking about where you live in
[54:30] certain places and even cities in the
[54:32] states here you can look at somebody and
[54:34] say what city are you from or what place
[54:37] are you from because there's an effect
[54:39] by the influences that are around
[54:42] and I really think in this hour that
[54:45] we're living in it has been almost a
[54:47] thing to wear because of the global
[54:50] interface it has become something that
[54:52] has worked to affect no matter if
[54:54] somebody lives in a big city or they
[54:56] live in a rural place and because of
[54:59] everything no more can you look at it
[55:01] and say wow those Styles they must be
[55:03] coming from a city no you see whatever
[55:05] images are coming on from that City or
[55:07] out here sometimes in farm country right
[55:09] the worldwide web
[55:13] where people getting stuck
[55:16] that's right but we're affected your
[55:18] influence the things you take upon
[55:20] customs and whatever more and we so we
[55:22] understand there's an effect and I want
[55:25] to just say it in this way that every
[55:27] one of us as believers
[55:29] through time through our lifetime
[55:32] have been affected and influenced by
[55:35] this other world and I'm talking about
[55:37] this this world that God by his grace
[55:41] has we have been birthed into this realm
[55:44] that's more real than the realm that we
[55:47] currently walk in in other words it's
[55:49] more real than these senses there's
[55:51] something that is more real that I
[55:54] haven't worked myself up you haven't
[55:56] worked yourself up but it's something
[55:58] that's more real than my seed my taste
[56:01] my feel my smell it's more real Than My
[56:04] reasonings my imaginations because when
[56:06] all of those things can only testify of
[56:10] what we see right here and the
[56:12] information that's taken in from things
[56:15] that are visible but there is a contact
[56:18] with another world and there's a
[56:21] different information there is
[56:23] revelation that's coming from The Unseen
[56:26] realm and when it's dropping into our
[56:29] hearts it affects our lives so much that
[56:34] people can look at us and they can look
[56:36] at you look at your decisions and say
[56:38] that don't make sense that don't sound
[56:42] right but what it is decisions you're
[56:45] making right now is under the influence
[56:48] of another Realm
[56:52] let me just continue to work with this
[56:54] because when we see this being affected
[56:57] and influence we are I believe this as
[57:01] Believers God even as we're coming to
[57:03] the point and place we come to it in our
[57:06] lives where where we meet the Living God
[57:09] almighty God who reveals and brings to
[57:12] us a reality of why that we could never
[57:16] settle into this world and I thank God
[57:19] for them
[57:20] we all try to as teenagers and
[57:23] everything else you try to fit in
[57:26] truth right you're trying to keep up why
[57:29] because that is what the world presents
[57:32] as a source of comfort if I can only get
[57:35] the latest style if I can only do this
[57:37] then I'll have comfort then I'll have
[57:39] peace but that's Satan's objective and
[57:42] we never overcome the world that way but
[57:45] the world actually overcomes and
[57:47] dominates our life right and we see it
[57:51] now even on the rise even within young
[57:53] people I I think over the past years and
[57:56] it's not in the in the poor communities
[57:58] it's among the very affluent communities
[58:01] the suicide rates and everything among
[58:04] young people and you know the things
[58:06] that are being said clear out there is
[58:09] things that are coming across from the
[58:11] internet and from media and whatever
[58:13] more let me just say this to you we are
[58:16] not exempt from those things
[58:20] that's why the token must be applied
[58:25] and when I say applied it's applied to
[58:28] every situation even for our children
[58:31] that don't have the Holy Ghost we apply
[58:35] the token as a filter for everything and
[58:39] judge it by the word
[58:44] so we're affected by that an influence
[58:47] to where we've become pilgrims and
[58:49] strangers Brethren would say it like
[58:52] this I want to read these two quotes to
[58:53] you
[58:54] so it'll further maybe come clear on the
[58:57] influence from another realm brother Ram
[58:59] said just below the regions of mortal
[59:02] beings lays the realm of demon power
[59:05] just above that lays The Souls of the
[59:08] unjust
[59:09] below it lays the very domain of Satan
[59:12] in hell then just above us lays the Holy
[59:16] Spirit
[59:17] then under the altar lays The Souls of
[59:20] the just men and the next is God himself
[59:22] so brother Brandon is laying it out of
[59:24] here we understand the seven dimensions
[59:26] time light and matter is where we live
[59:29] fourth dimension television raised the
[59:32] cell phone all those other things that
[59:34] are coming through
[59:35] Fifth Dimension is that of hell
[59:38] yeah is that right we're The Souls of
[59:40] the unjust the sixth Dimension is that
[59:43] of The Souls of the just and the seventh
[59:45] Dimension is where God is dwelling
[59:47] himself
[59:49] so here we are right uh smack dab in the
[59:54] middle that's how brother Branham is
[59:55] placing him just above us lays the Holy
[59:58] Spirit then under the altar lays The
[1:00:00] Souls of the just men the next is God
[1:00:02] himself one going downward one going
[1:00:05] upward the two Spirits are here on Earth
[1:00:09] influencing the people of this Earth
[1:00:14] true he goes on in demonology and he's
[1:00:17] talking about a channel and he says he
[1:00:20] goes into here uh where I want to start
[1:00:22] there where it says there's a channel
[1:00:24] like this
[1:00:25] and that's where Mortals live in here so
[1:00:28] there's a channel where Mortals live
[1:00:30] that's where that's where we live all
[1:00:32] Mortals live in it's a conglomeration of
[1:00:36] gaiety Blackness and sin and every once
[1:00:40] in a while you'll see a little white
[1:00:42] spot or a light and Jesus said you're a
[1:00:45] light that sits on a hill don't light a
[1:00:48] candle and put it over in a bushel how
[1:00:49] many knows that Paul said we were
[1:00:52] sometimes Darkness
[1:00:54] but now are you lighting the Lord
[1:00:58] what light are we talking about we're
[1:01:00] talking about God is light we're talking
[1:01:04] about God that has come to light up our
[1:01:08] life and every once in a while you see a
[1:01:10] little flicker of Darkness it would it
[1:01:12] would be like that we'd look there you
[1:01:14] know where you have in a very dark dark
[1:01:16] room and striking up a match well no
[1:01:19] matter how small the light is the
[1:01:21] darkness cannot overtake the light
[1:01:23] the light will pierce the darkness and
[1:01:26] to see that in the time and the hour and
[1:01:28] where we're living here the light of God
[1:01:30] that shineth forth that same light that
[1:01:33] John writes of that lighteth every man
[1:01:36] that cometh into the world this same
[1:01:38] light has lit the believer and that's
[1:01:40] what is among this conglomeration listen
[1:01:43] this Darkness I remember down in Egypt
[1:01:46] the Bible said there was a darkness that
[1:01:48] covered the land that could be felt
[1:01:52] it was pressure Isaiah 61 says gross
[1:01:56] Darkness shall cover the people
[1:01:59] well what is that gross Darkness it's
[1:02:01] demon powers but how are those demon
[1:02:04] powers in a place of influence upon
[1:02:08] people's lives because listen those
[1:02:11] Spirits were released in Revelations 9
[1:02:13] the Bible said there was one that came
[1:02:16] falling this Angel didn't descend he got
[1:02:18] kicked out
[1:02:20] he was descending but he had a key to
[1:02:23] the bottomless pit and he loosened up
[1:02:25] and here we find there was a hundred
[1:02:28] thousand thousand demons that were
[1:02:31] released but when were they released
[1:02:33] against they were released against that
[1:02:34] of the Jews right there were men like
[1:02:37] Hitler and Stalin and brother Brown said
[1:02:39] they were channels that then Spirits
[1:02:42] could come through
[1:02:43] but God had to get his people back in
[1:02:46] the Homeland for the Messiah to be made
[1:02:49] manifest there is a promised visitation
[1:02:51] of a hundred and forty four thousand
[1:02:54] Hallelujah
[1:02:56] and the same thing now those Spirits you
[1:02:59] say well well you know Stalin and uh uh
[1:03:02] you know Hitler and all that you know
[1:03:04] the Bible said in Genesis 6 here's a
[1:03:06] repeat the Bible said in Genesis 6 that
[1:03:09] the Earth was filled in the days of Noah
[1:03:12] with violence through them
[1:03:15] do you realize the only way like in this
[1:03:18] building we the only way we get
[1:03:20] electricity here is because electricity
[1:03:23] has been brought to this building and
[1:03:26] it's wired up for it do you realize
[1:03:28] violence could have never got into the
[1:03:31] Earth those acts if there hadn't have
[1:03:33] been lives that were channels for that
[1:03:36] violence to come through and be made
[1:03:38] manifest
[1:03:40] I said God there was a man on Earth by
[1:03:43] the name of Noah may we be counted as
[1:03:45] channels like Noah where God said in the
[1:03:49] midst of this Darkness there is a man
[1:03:52] who found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[1:03:55] that God would reveal himself and his
[1:03:58] plans before the impending of
[1:04:00] Destruction brother Graham said that's
[1:04:02] Christians in this conglomeration of
[1:04:05] this dimension of Mortals going this way
[1:04:08] downward and the next soul is The Souls
[1:04:11] of the unjust who died not knowing god
[1:04:13] the second is demons and the third in
[1:04:16] the Trinity is Hell unless souls and
[1:04:18] unjust Souls demons and Hell there's a
[1:04:21] trinity here one of them was caught into
[1:04:23] the third heaven talking about Paul the
[1:04:26] first is a ghost too the Holy Ghost
[1:04:29] so going this way it's the Holy Ghost
[1:04:31] below it's demon power
[1:04:34] right now the first is that goes to the
[1:04:37] Holy Ghost second is Angels third heaven
[1:04:40] itself now these mortals in this
[1:04:42] Dimension here is influenced either from
[1:04:46] there or from here
[1:04:49] so that's why that when we recognize in
[1:04:54] this time in this hour and where we are
[1:04:56] living as every uh child of God that has
[1:05:00] lived upon the Earth since the Fall In
[1:05:03] the Garden of Eden where there was Eve
[1:05:06] came under the influence of deception
[1:05:09] and she surrendered and look what it
[1:05:11] brought forth it brought forth a king
[1:05:15] is that right she came under that
[1:05:18] influence when was that influence doing
[1:05:20] it it talked to her it moved upon her
[1:05:23] listen it moved her by way of unbelief
[1:05:27] let me just say this unbelief is also an
[1:05:30] anointing
[1:05:31] as faith is an anointing unbelief is an
[1:05:35] anointing doubt is an anointing I'm
[1:05:37] saying this clearly it's not just when
[1:05:40] we say oh that's just a thought it's a
[1:05:43] spirit
[1:05:44] when something comes to you and wants to
[1:05:47] make you doubt it's a devil
[1:05:51] it may not be the Devil Himself but one
[1:05:53] of his imps but the thing of it is is to
[1:05:56] recognize what it is that it's a spirit
[1:05:59] that's coming against you and he's there
[1:06:01] to try to hinder he's there to try to
[1:06:04] torment he's there to try to tear you
[1:06:06] down and he would like you to get you
[1:06:09] looking at this realm right here in your
[1:06:12] five natural senses and in your
[1:06:15] spiritual senses what do I what must I
[1:06:18] do live by the sense of Faith that'll
[1:06:21] call those things that are as though
[1:06:23] they are none brother Samuel I may not
[1:06:26] feel it it don't matter if you feel it
[1:06:28] God said it it is true it is amen
[1:06:33] my feelings don't have nothing to do
[1:06:35] with it let me tell you when you make a
[1:06:38] stand for God and a stand for God's word
[1:06:40] you say what will happen I'll tell you
[1:06:42] what will happen when Stephen they were
[1:06:45] stoning him to death let me tell you the
[1:06:47] lamb himself stood up to welcome him
[1:06:50] home you may not be able to see it here
[1:06:53] in this Dimension with these natural
[1:06:55] eyes but let me tell you there is a
[1:06:58] cloud of many witnesses that have stood
[1:07:01] faithful through tests and trials and
[1:07:04] let me tell you something there's an
[1:07:05] action of the holy spirit all Heaven is
[1:07:09] behind this revelation
[1:07:13] glory be to God
[1:07:16] all these great qualities I I don't have
[1:07:19] time to spend upon it within Moses but
[1:07:22] every one of these great qualities of
[1:07:25] Faith as we read about in the scriptures
[1:07:28] are opening texts
[1:07:30] of these the faith that was within him
[1:07:32] as far as Moses himself he had so come
[1:07:37] under the influence of this realm that
[1:07:40] was leading upward although if we can
[1:07:43] say it like this Moses had not had his
[1:07:47] personal experience with God to where
[1:07:50] his faith would become anointed but he
[1:07:53] had a mother
[1:07:55] he had some parents and if you'll notice
[1:07:58] the opening scripture uh Brianna go back
[1:08:00] up to the very first scripture I read if
[1:08:02] you'll notice that opening scripture it
[1:08:05] starts out with by faith Moses when he
[1:08:08] was born
[1:08:10] and you would think wait a minute
[1:08:12] it speaks as though he was before he was
[1:08:15] born well as a real son and daughter of
[1:08:18] God we were we existed in the thoughts
[1:08:21] of almighty God and you look and say was
[1:08:24] hit three months of his parents Moses
[1:08:26] didn't hide himself three months but his
[1:08:28] parents were abiding in the promise of
[1:08:31] God and when God met his daddy Abraham
[1:08:35] and yoshabelle that they were so
[1:08:38] influenced by the Unseen realm their
[1:08:41] faith had already been anointed Moses
[1:08:43] Faith wasn't anointed but they became
[1:08:46] such channels of divine influence to
[1:08:49] where the promises of God Moses knew
[1:08:52] about him
[1:08:54] can I say it like this that Moses's
[1:08:57] parents were not dependent upon the
[1:09:00] pastor or the Sunday school teacher or
[1:09:02] somebody else but they said God you have
[1:09:05] given us this child and our life is
[1:09:08] going to be a source of influence if
[1:09:10] there's things they're going to know
[1:09:11] they're going to know about God's word I
[1:09:13] don't want them I don't want him to be
[1:09:16] tangled up with Egypt I don't want him
[1:09:18] to know about all the ways of Egypt I do
[1:09:21] not want him to look at excelling in the
[1:09:23] ways of Egypt I want to have Christ set
[1:09:27] before him at all times
[1:09:31] think about it he lived in Pharaoh's
[1:09:33] house
[1:09:35] but think about what was in Pharaoh's
[1:09:37] house his mama was there in Pharaoh's
[1:09:40] house she was an influence she did not
[1:09:43] encourage him in the ways of Egypt did
[1:09:45] he have to have an education sure but we
[1:09:48] recognize when you look what was the
[1:09:51] main undeniable Focus that was present
[1:09:54] there his mama was a Channel of
[1:09:57] influence of the supernatural that she
[1:10:00] had met
[1:10:03] somebody say preach
[1:10:07] we have such a stewardship and a
[1:10:10] responsibility that here is in this and
[1:10:12] I'll say what a privilege
[1:10:14] what a privilege but our lives can be a
[1:10:17] source of influence
[1:10:19] but I don't want to I don't I don't want
[1:10:21] it to be an influence that'll take
[1:10:23] somebody away
[1:10:24] but they want to be an influence that it
[1:10:26] causes lives to be challenged and I'm
[1:10:29] not talking about being put down I'm
[1:10:30] talking about encourage to recognize
[1:10:32] that God the way that God would work
[1:10:35] through a life like that and what's the
[1:10:37] objective what's the motive what's the
[1:10:39] main focus in our life oh brother Samuel
[1:10:41] you you just too much you just you lived
[1:10:44] in this should we do too much you talk
[1:10:45] you act like we ought to be monsters I'm
[1:10:47] not acting like we ought to be monks but
[1:10:49] I'm saying it ought to be such a
[1:10:51] predominance in our life I'm talking by
[1:10:54] the word of God that it should not be a
[1:10:57] question of who and what is first place
[1:11:00] in our life not what we say it's what we
[1:11:04] do
[1:11:05] and the church said
[1:11:07] we're influenced by realm leading upward
[1:11:13] notice
[1:11:15] and because of this influence
[1:11:18] Moses is steamed he didn't even have the
[1:11:21] Holy Ghost yet
[1:11:23] his faith wasn't even anointed
[1:11:25] but he has stinged the reproach for
[1:11:28] Christ
[1:11:29] to be identified remember out of the
[1:11:32] same window
[1:11:34] same window
[1:11:36] Pharaoh looked and Moses looked
[1:11:40] and Moses looked out the same window
[1:11:42] faith not anointed yet could look out
[1:11:44] there and he saw the people of God who
[1:11:47] gave him eyes to see things that way his
[1:11:50] parents
[1:11:52] preach somebody
[1:11:54] his parents in the word that was setting
[1:11:56] under listen we don't want to look
[1:11:58] around we should not be walking around
[1:12:00] as defeated Christians that's not how
[1:12:02] the word is guiding us
[1:12:04] it even doesn't matter where you're
[1:12:06] sitting at right now this morning we're
[1:12:09] here right now that we would go upward
[1:12:11] we want to be under the influence of an
[1:12:14] upward pull we're being pulled upward
[1:12:16] come up hither
[1:12:21] and we all have to deserve we have to
[1:12:23] reflect friends listen one of the
[1:12:25] greatest things I know everybody's got
[1:12:26] mirrors
[1:12:29] I know that
[1:12:32] but one of the greatest things that we
[1:12:33] could do
[1:12:34] is say God help me to really reflect
[1:12:36] down in my life
[1:12:39] and I really mean that that we pray God
[1:12:41] help me to reflect where I'm at
[1:12:45] everybody heard the story about the
[1:12:46] in-person new clothes
[1:12:49] well I don't want to have to tell it
[1:12:52] but somebody came and deceived him and
[1:12:55] had him walking out there completely
[1:12:56] nude and he thought he had on a good
[1:12:58] piece of garment
[1:13:00] I'm telling you we want to be sure when
[1:13:02] we're looking in the mirror of God's
[1:13:04] word lord it's an examination for my
[1:13:07] life
[1:13:09] I mean certainly we're not all sitting
[1:13:11] here this morning because we're right on
[1:13:13] man we're on a roll a plus Christians
[1:13:15] it's not because we're honor roll or a
[1:13:18] plus Christians we have come to the
[1:13:20] house of God not for our strong points
[1:13:22] to be highlighted but our weak places to
[1:13:27] be exposed
[1:13:28] why because God doesn't want us living
[1:13:31] beneath our privileges
[1:13:34] because who knows the choices and
[1:13:37] decisions that you have before you or
[1:13:40] your children are the rest and it's
[1:13:41] going to be very very crucial that
[1:13:44] you're under the influence of the right
[1:13:46] Realm
[1:13:47] and let me just say this Satan's Duty is
[1:13:51] to always bring you into this realm
[1:13:57] he can't bring you to Hell once you pass
[1:14:00] from Death unto life but his desire is
[1:14:02] to bring you right here and get so
[1:14:04] occupied remember when the prophet was
[1:14:06] standing there on the platform and that
[1:14:08] Maniac came up and he spit there in his
[1:14:10] face it's running down and here brother
[1:14:12] Brown feels it he sees it hears the
[1:14:15] threats all those things but then
[1:14:17] brother Adam says I chose to begin to
[1:14:20] think different thoughts and the police
[1:14:22] officers came out and said should we lay
[1:14:24] hands on him he said no this is not a
[1:14:26] flesh and blood Affair he realized
[1:14:28] though flesh and blood is standing
[1:14:30] before him that this man is under the
[1:14:33] influence of another Realm and when he
[1:14:36] made the challenge he did now notice the
[1:14:39] prophet said I chose to think different
[1:14:42] thoughts and the thoughts he began to
[1:14:44] think brother I've said instead of
[1:14:45] despising that man I started looking and
[1:14:47] saying no doubt he's a good man got a
[1:14:49] good home got a good family and this and
[1:14:51] that he don't want to be that way what
[1:14:53] was he doing entering in for
[1:14:55] intercession it invited the mighty
[1:14:57] conqueror the holy spirit because that
[1:15:00] man I don't care Brethren been a good
[1:15:02] boxer that man would have whipped him
[1:15:03] all over why he was anointed and
[1:15:06] inspired with demon power
[1:15:09] is that right but here the prophet chose
[1:15:13] and in the midst of that moment and here
[1:15:16] came the influence from another realm
[1:15:19] here came the chief Captain the Mighty
[1:15:22] God who was over and greater where even
[1:15:25] those angels and demons that had fallen
[1:15:28] and was anointing this man they were
[1:15:30] under that of the mighty creator that
[1:15:34] they had been created in the beginning
[1:15:35] but they fell and here was one with the
[1:15:38] greater Authority
[1:15:42] how can that be because a Son of God was
[1:15:45] standing there and yielded himself
[1:15:51] and there came an influence
[1:15:53] from another Realm
[1:15:56] I said God help us like that
[1:15:58] because the battles are always all
[1:16:00] around us
[1:16:03] oh my sometimes we can get so busy about
[1:16:06] talking about can you believe can you
[1:16:07] believe can you believe and when missing
[1:16:09] opportunities
[1:16:11] for the influence from another Realm
[1:16:14] because this is just a moment
[1:16:17] now it depends you can make it a
[1:16:20] lifetime but keep on talking about it
[1:16:22] dwelling on it
[1:16:24] make posters of I've been hurt posters
[1:16:27] of offenses posters of a and every time
[1:16:29] you go you're Waltz I'm talking about in
[1:16:31] here your walls become decorated with
[1:16:35] offenses
[1:16:37] Nobody Knows the devil no the devil
[1:16:39] don't do that it depends on whether or
[1:16:41] not that we will take that the high I
[1:16:44] said God let us live under that
[1:16:46] influence of that realm that can really
[1:16:49] bring real healing real Deliverance
[1:16:52] real truth to our lives
[1:16:55] so he had a he had a a choice Moses made
[1:16:58] a choice he had he esteemed the reproach
[1:17:01] of Christ greater riches in the
[1:17:02] treasures in Egypt because he had
[1:17:03] recompense unto the reward and to think
[1:17:07] how that Moses himself you know
[1:17:09] different statements here that I I just
[1:17:11] you know in Reading over of how that
[1:17:13] Moses his faith this Faith he was able
[1:17:16] even in that time as a young person by
[1:17:19] the grace of God to be able to look
[1:17:22] beyond all of the glamor of the world
[1:17:25] that was around him think about
[1:17:27] everything that was around Moses at that
[1:17:29] time everything that Egypt it was right
[1:17:32] there at his fingertips but Moses didn't
[1:17:36] pay any attention to it
[1:17:40] are you with me it didn't say he didn't
[1:17:43] see it he didn't give no time to it
[1:17:47] remember that's why the prophet said in
[1:17:49] greatest Bible fought don't stop to
[1:17:52] listen
[1:17:54] keep on going
[1:17:56] don't pay any attention to it
[1:17:59] the devil tells you you never get the
[1:18:01] Holy Ghost look beyond that
[1:18:03] God made the promise a man didn't make
[1:18:06] you that promise the prophet didn't make
[1:18:08] you that promise God made the promise
[1:18:10] and he sent a prophet in this hour to
[1:18:13] let you and I know what our real
[1:18:15] god-given rights are
[1:18:18] the devil can say you're no good you'll
[1:18:22] never be able or I just heard the
[1:18:23] prophet say yesterday morning in the
[1:18:25] token message he said no matter where
[1:18:28] you're at no matter what you've been in
[1:18:30] no matter the mess there has already
[1:18:32] been a perpetuation made for you that
[1:18:36] you can go free
[1:18:40] that's worship the resurrected Lord
[1:18:43] Jesus Christ and say I Ain't Gonna
[1:18:45] Worship in my mistakes I Ain't Gonna
[1:18:47] Worship my failures I am not going to
[1:18:50] worship all of the reasons why I can't
[1:18:53] he said I could he said it's mine and
[1:18:56] I'm going to take it
[1:18:58] news
[1:19:00] he looked Plum over into tomorrow
[1:19:04] you got to hide your eyes from this
[1:19:06] present world how do I hide my eyes by
[1:19:08] looking at the right thing
[1:19:12] you got to be looking and get occupied
[1:19:15] with the right thing and looking me on
[1:19:17] till tomorrow Moses couldn't look and
[1:19:19] realize judgment is coming upon Egypt
[1:19:23] his faith wasn't anointed yet
[1:19:25] but he had Faith within him what had
[1:19:28] increased that Faith to that place you
[1:19:30] say intellectual faith it was what had
[1:19:32] brought that about even the parents
[1:19:34] laying in and how that they were laying
[1:19:36] in the promises of God and reminding
[1:19:39] listen they would remind him God spoke
[1:19:42] to us and announced that your birth was
[1:19:45] coming on they could remind him the
[1:19:48] pillar of fire came in the room and hung
[1:19:50] over where you're at they could remind
[1:19:52] him that when all the rest of the
[1:19:55] children were being delivered to the
[1:19:56] crocodiles we were moved by the spirit
[1:19:59] of God because of what God spoke to us
[1:20:01] God opened up a way when we didn't even
[1:20:03] know how we were going to get through
[1:20:05] that time we thought for when there was
[1:20:07] a thought that went through our mind
[1:20:09] this here we are holding crocodile meat
[1:20:11] but there was something that rose up
[1:20:13] that rebuked that thought that wanted to
[1:20:16] come in our mind why because God had
[1:20:18] spoken who can but prophesied God spoke
[1:20:22] to us you're a proper child and you've
[1:20:24] been hit for three months and God
[1:20:26] revealed the hiding place and the hiding
[1:20:29] place is make an ark and Pitch it with
[1:20:31] tar
[1:20:34] you see we've had the trust in Moses for
[1:20:37] every step of your life we didn't know
[1:20:40] how things were going to be when you got
[1:20:42] in middle school but we've had to trust
[1:20:43] God but there's one thing about it think
[1:20:46] about it when they sent him off they did
[1:20:48] not become less of an influence they
[1:20:50] became more of an influence upon his
[1:20:52] life I tell you if his mom and daddy had
[1:20:55] succumbed to that of Egypt and they had
[1:20:57] fostered the pleasures of Egypt there's
[1:20:59] no telling what would have happened to
[1:21:00] Moses but they went right into the house
[1:21:03] of pharaoh right into Satan's Eden and
[1:21:05] they said there is a channel of what God
[1:21:08] has done for our life this is what the
[1:21:09] token is that you have confidence that
[1:21:12] what the same God has done for you and
[1:21:15] changed your life he will also change
[1:21:18] the lives of your children
[1:21:21] hello
[1:21:23] brother Samuel we cannot control the
[1:21:25] time I know that I realize that we do
[1:21:28] not control the time of oh my you know I
[1:21:30] should have done this and I should have
[1:21:31] done that listen friends I believe in
[1:21:33] youth camps I believe in getting
[1:21:35] together if there's only one thing we
[1:21:36] ought to be supporting we ought to be
[1:21:38] supporting where the young people are
[1:21:40] getting into the presence of almighty
[1:21:41] God now y'all believe that what's on my
[1:21:43] heart that's what's very important but I
[1:21:46] believe that if we just leave it to
[1:21:48] those types of things we miss the
[1:21:51] responsibility and Duty that God has
[1:21:53] called us to what if I as a pastor left
[1:21:56] you to just a place of just special
[1:21:59] meeting after special meeting you would
[1:22:01] go from Mountaintop to Mountain Top to
[1:22:03] Mountaintop and we never know how to
[1:22:06] live a real overcoming Christian life
[1:22:08] because fruit does not grow on the
[1:22:11] mountains but what happens on the
[1:22:13] mountains inspires you for the valley
[1:22:16] times it's where fruit comes out of your
[1:22:19] life that's where the fruit of what God
[1:22:21] has done in your life that's why with
[1:22:23] the ministering the word Let It Be an
[1:22:25] influence from that other realm that's
[1:22:28] influencing you when you come in here oh
[1:22:31] you might feel so down you might be
[1:22:33] looking at circumstances that are before
[1:22:35] you but here under the presence of
[1:22:37] almighty God the very thing that was
[1:22:40] gloomed begins to be pushed back what is
[1:22:43] that that is the light of almighty God
[1:22:45] the influence coming from another Realm
[1:22:48] encouragement
[1:22:50] Hallelujah he knew that judgment was
[1:22:53] coming his parents had told him that and
[1:22:55] that's why when they offered him
[1:22:57] positions
[1:23:00] you can be this
[1:23:02] you can do this
[1:23:04] they offered him but this is what he
[1:23:05] said
[1:23:07] I ain't a son of pharaoh
[1:23:10] I'm a son of Abraham
[1:23:13] you see there have been such a
[1:23:14] cultivation there have been such a
[1:23:17] brother sister that's just not in our
[1:23:19] home that's why the word the message of
[1:23:21] the hour has come to you and I it's to
[1:23:24] cultivate the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:23:27] what is it it's God moving Upon Our Own
[1:23:30] thoughts it's God moving upon our own
[1:23:33] lives that we're not looking in a mirror
[1:23:35] of defeated and always walking in Gloom
[1:23:38] but to recognize who you are and you're
[1:23:40] not the devil's punching bag You Were
[1:23:43] Meant to torment hell
[1:23:45] the Son of God was manifested to destroy
[1:23:49] the works of the devil and let me tell
[1:23:51] you the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:23:53] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:23:56] devil the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:59] in your life is to destroy every whole
[1:24:03] Every curse every claim that's ever been
[1:24:06] on your family what's happened the
[1:24:08] abstract has come upon the sea to anoint
[1:24:12] your faith to look beyond all of the
[1:24:16] shortcomings
[1:24:18] look beyond all
[1:24:20] of the inabilities of life and say I am
[1:24:25] a super
[1:24:27] super
[1:24:28] human being
[1:24:31] come on I'm writing the word
[1:24:34] until that super sense has come
[1:24:37] we're just human beings
[1:24:39] but when faith has come there has been a
[1:24:43] super super sense that's moved in and
[1:24:46] now it is greater than every other sense
[1:24:49] and see that's the sense that's where
[1:24:52] that's where we want to live from like
[1:24:53] we're looking at on Thursday night I'm
[1:24:55] not a son of pharaoh when things come
[1:24:58] around I'm not a son of pharaoh I'm a
[1:25:00] son of Abraham well this is how our
[1:25:02] family always I'm not a son of pharaoh
[1:25:06] come on Friends
[1:25:09] oh brother Sammy you don't know brother
[1:25:11] Sammy how long my mom and dad have been
[1:25:13] in the message you don't know how how
[1:25:15] long well it don't matter how long the
[1:25:17] genes themselves are still sons of
[1:25:19] pharaoh
[1:25:22] come on we don't get where we are
[1:25:24] because of natural genes and we've said
[1:25:25] on a message Pew so long that ain't it
[1:25:27] that sin that sonship and daughter of
[1:25:30] God it come predestinated from before
[1:25:32] the foundation of the world
[1:25:35] amen and God never lost sight of you
[1:25:38] see what brother Samuel it's got to take
[1:25:40] God to bring that quickening it does it
[1:25:43] does take God to bring that quickening
[1:25:44] and sometimes let me just say it across
[1:25:46] the church sometimes even across the
[1:25:48] church it can take an eagle a long time
[1:25:50] to recognize they're an eagle it can
[1:25:53] take a long time but what's important is
[1:25:56] there's an influence from the other
[1:25:57] realm that is greater and more powerful
[1:26:00] and is able to break the yoke
[1:26:03] by the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:05] shedding down it'll break that yoke of
[1:26:09] depression it'll break that yoke that of
[1:26:11] doubt it'll break that yoke of despair
[1:26:16] [Applause]
[1:26:19] you see that Eagle Eye it lifts us above
[1:26:21] to be able to see tomorrow
[1:26:25] we all realize what what we deal with
[1:26:28] today is because of decisions from
[1:26:29] yesterday
[1:26:31] is that right
[1:26:33] lot himself did not he didn't pay
[1:26:36] attention to the decisions he was making
[1:26:39] it cost him
[1:26:41] it cost his family
[1:26:44] right I could talk about Jacob too in
[1:26:46] some of the decision but I'm going to do
[1:26:47] that today I I want to stay here but I'm
[1:26:50] just saying we realize decisions are
[1:26:51] important
[1:26:53] decisions are very important of our life
[1:26:55] now let me say something decisions
[1:26:57] themselves do not undo predestined
[1:27:00] predestination cannot be undone no more
[1:27:02] than it can be merited
[1:27:04] are you with me this is why brother bran
[1:27:07] says find the purpose that God has you
[1:27:09] here for and you'll save yourself a
[1:27:10] whole lot of trouble
[1:27:12] and God a whole lot of trouble
[1:27:14] because the predestination does not mean
[1:27:16] that it's going to keep me from every
[1:27:18] bad decision or decisions made because
[1:27:20] sometimes there's decisions that lives
[1:27:22] have to live with they've made decisions
[1:27:25] right it's like right now today here you
[1:27:28] are you can be completely full of the
[1:27:30] Holy Ghost and you make a bad financial
[1:27:31] decision guess what you got to deal with
[1:27:34] it
[1:27:35] you got to deal with it
[1:27:37] and it's a bad decision and you realize
[1:27:39] wait a minute how did this happen
[1:27:40] definitely I was not really submitting
[1:27:43] under the influence of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:46] boy it got quiet in here now
[1:27:50] glory be to God but friends it's so true
[1:27:53] in our lives why you say brother the
[1:27:55] same and where would that be in
[1:27:56] scripture okay I'll give you two places
[1:27:58] the Bible said stand you fast in the
[1:28:00] Liberty wherewith Christ and made you
[1:28:01] free and be not entangled again in the
[1:28:04] yoga bondage don't let things get you
[1:28:06] down here and bound in this world the
[1:28:09] Bible tells us Paul tells us in the book
[1:28:11] of Timothy that no man that woreeth a
[1:28:13] good Warfare a good soldier entangled
[1:28:16] himself with the Affairs of this life
[1:28:18] there are things that we have to attend
[1:28:21] to
[1:28:22] there's things in the natural I hate
[1:28:24] doing
[1:28:27] there's times I I I maybe shouldn't use
[1:28:30] the word hate but I don't know how to
[1:28:31] say it
[1:28:32] I mean I don't feel like you know I
[1:28:34] don't I don't enjoy making out certain
[1:28:36] bills or having to make you know call
[1:28:38] around and find out who's my electric
[1:28:39] supplier going to be and look I don't
[1:28:41] enjoy that
[1:28:43] right
[1:28:45] but I will tell you what I do I said God
[1:28:48] help me to make the right decision
[1:28:52] I'm asking him I want his Direction
[1:28:54] because sometimes those things of Life
[1:28:56] can get you so stressed out and that's
[1:28:59] what Satan's objective is because when
[1:29:01] you get stressed out you no longer are
[1:29:03] acting like a son and daughter of God
[1:29:05] you're acting like a son of pharaoh or a
[1:29:08] daughter of pharaoh
[1:29:10] but I'm saying how can you say that
[1:29:12] because there is one who's in control
[1:29:15] before there was ever a sin he was
[1:29:18] already a savior
[1:29:21] my father was ever a sickness he was a
[1:29:23] Healer
[1:29:25] it's like the Robin says brother Brown
[1:29:26] dramatized that from a story and he said
[1:29:28] these Robins are looking around they're
[1:29:30] humans and he said good Lord look at him
[1:29:32] high blood pressure and everything else
[1:29:33] and they're running around all stressed
[1:29:35] out he said I wonder you know when Robin
[1:29:37] looked the other said I wonder if they
[1:29:38] maybe they don't have a Heavenly Father
[1:29:40] Like We Do
[1:29:43] all right
[1:29:44] that's good now you know what I'm
[1:29:46] preaching is real
[1:29:48] these are things we have to battle
[1:29:50] against
[1:29:51] I'm trying to get somewhere we battle
[1:29:53] against this it isn't that all of a
[1:29:55] sudden we step over here and all of that
[1:29:58] battle is gone no now you're in a battle
[1:30:00] and the battle because really before you
[1:30:03] wasn't in so much of a battle you were
[1:30:05] pressing on with God but now every gun
[1:30:08] out of hell is trained on you
[1:30:10] but greater is he that's in you
[1:30:14] brother Samuel the devil's been
[1:30:16] bothering me good he don't got you
[1:30:20] he's been bothering Mike because you're
[1:30:22] tormenting hell
[1:30:25] what should you do give him some of his
[1:30:27] own medicine
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:33] that's why Paul could say in second
[1:30:36] Corinthians 5 7 we walk by for we walk
[1:30:39] by faith and not by sight
[1:30:42] because faith can look at God's worst
[1:30:45] and it'll steam it Greater
[1:30:48] Moses saw a people with the promise
[1:30:52] Pharaoh looked down and said
[1:30:55] foreign
[1:30:58] worthless people
[1:31:01] worthless promise
[1:31:05] not Moses
[1:31:07] he had respect
[1:31:09] to the reward
[1:31:11] I want you to listen this I don't have
[1:31:13] this this quote up there but I want you
[1:31:14] to listen this statement this is very
[1:31:15] very important I'm going I'm trying to
[1:31:17] get somewhere here this morning
[1:31:19] Faith doesn't look at the present time
[1:31:25] I know sometimes that's the challenge
[1:31:27] like really
[1:31:29] the present time presently what we are
[1:31:31] facing presently what we're going
[1:31:33] through or presently decisions but
[1:31:34] listen Faith does not look at the
[1:31:36] present time let me just let me deal
[1:31:37] here Faith doesn't see this here Faith
[1:31:40] looks to what God wants and it works
[1:31:43] accordingly that's what faith does it
[1:31:45] sees what God wants and what God wants
[1:31:47] done and Faith operates through that
[1:31:51] so faith is a long-ring vision it don't
[1:31:54] lower its sight it holds to the Target
[1:31:58] so you see
[1:31:59] Satan's objective is to keep things in
[1:32:02] present time
[1:32:04] but Faith looks beyond the present and
[1:32:07] sees the future
[1:32:09] if I keep going this way that's why a
[1:32:11] person you can sit here today and
[1:32:14] whatever condition you're in if you
[1:32:15] remain in that condition you know where
[1:32:17] you'll be found
[1:32:19] if you're lost and without God if God
[1:32:22] listen if there's not a change that's
[1:32:24] made within that right now tomorrow is
[1:32:27] going to give witness of the decisions
[1:32:29] that was set before you today
[1:32:32] is that right but Faith does not become
[1:32:35] occupied or entangled in just present
[1:32:38] Affairs sometimes listen friends the
[1:32:40] enemy can get so much on he said she
[1:32:43] said and this and that and you know my
[1:32:45] family this and this and all those
[1:32:48] things are nothing but traps to get you
[1:32:51] entangled in present moments
[1:32:56] let me ask you this question you say
[1:32:59] brother Samuel the president's pretty
[1:33:00] real all right let me ask you this
[1:33:01] question do you think all your hurt and
[1:33:04] your offenses and all your complaints
[1:33:05] and everything you think that's going to
[1:33:07] be on the other side
[1:33:09] as soon as you step between Mortal and
[1:33:11] immortality you think you're going to be
[1:33:13] running down to say you never believe
[1:33:14] what so-and-so did to me
[1:33:19] you think you're going to be running for
[1:33:20] somebody Hey listen let me tell you what
[1:33:21] my boss did last week you ain't gonna
[1:33:22] care about your boss
[1:33:25] but you see listen friends I'm not
[1:33:27] saying situations aren't real we're
[1:33:30] saying don't let Faith come down here if
[1:33:33] you put your sights down here you're
[1:33:36] going to crash you're going to wreck
[1:33:37] you've got to set your sights up there
[1:33:40] and when you can't see in front of you
[1:33:43] there are Divine instruments that God
[1:33:47] has placed before us that we can fly
[1:33:50] through him by Divine instruments and
[1:33:52] when we can say I'm not real good at
[1:33:54] reading the instruments we can be guided
[1:33:57] by the radar of prayer and that's how
[1:34:01] Believers praying always without ceasing
[1:34:09] good preacher
[1:34:11] every day lunch box living
[1:34:16] faith is a long-range Vision it don't
[1:34:19] lower its sights it holds to the Target
[1:34:22] and use binoculars
[1:34:25] now brother Brian if you came in here
[1:34:26] with binoculars this morning and were
[1:34:28] looking at me
[1:34:32] I'd Wonder or him or Brother Richard I
[1:34:35] would really wonder why do you have
[1:34:37] binoculars on
[1:34:38] and looking up here at me
[1:34:41] right
[1:34:42] it don't make sense the reason you would
[1:34:44] say that is is because binoculars are
[1:34:46] not used to see objects that are close
[1:34:50] binoculars are used to see things that
[1:34:53] are afar off
[1:34:55] it's like
[1:34:57] it's brown
[1:34:58] it's got fur on it oh it's a lab
[1:35:02] it's a dog but then when you see a it's
[1:35:04] a deer how many points that have you see
[1:35:07] you you can't maybe see that far off but
[1:35:09] what does the binoculars take things
[1:35:11] that are a far off and brings it close
[1:35:15] to you so you start making decisions now
[1:35:19] by the things you're seeing before off
[1:35:21] and that's what the binoculars of Old
[1:35:24] Testament and New Testament as it's
[1:35:26] lined up together it lets us see there
[1:35:29] is no certainty in this world but what I
[1:35:32] see is a Rapture what I see is every
[1:35:34] promise of God what I see is every devil
[1:35:38] under my feet what I see is every devil
[1:35:40] conquered I see that through the victory
[1:35:43] of the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:45] coming upon the word
[1:35:49] brother Samuel I don't see it right now
[1:35:51] we don't see all things
[1:35:54] but I'm looking for out and say already
[1:35:57] conquered
[1:35:59] and what do you do walk towards what
[1:36:02] you're seeing and eventually my hope my
[1:36:06] faith will become sight
[1:36:09] eventually the binoculars at the change
[1:36:12] of the body get put down
[1:36:16] glory and be the god in the highest
[1:36:19] hallelujah oh my don't let the devil get
[1:36:21] their binoculars out of your hands
[1:36:24] it's like when Zach and I are in the
[1:36:26] booth you know I Gotta Wear I have to
[1:36:27] wear the glaring booth and uh blind I
[1:36:31] have to wear glasses and I don't know
[1:36:32] maybe some of y'all can help me but I'll
[1:36:34] tell you what looking through a
[1:36:35] binoculars I hate getting my glasses all
[1:36:36] fogged up
[1:36:38] sometimes I have to take them out and
[1:36:39] you know rearrange them and like and
[1:36:41] everything else and Zach Zaxby's are the
[1:36:43] one he's the very dad he's got the
[1:36:45] binoculars on he's looking at it Dad dad
[1:36:46] here's something coming here say oh Dad
[1:36:48] it's not don't worry and he's always
[1:36:49] looking through the binocular but I say
[1:36:51] it like this listen every one of us you
[1:36:54] have an access to a set of binoculars
[1:36:57] and don't let the devil get them out of
[1:36:59] your hand because if you get them out of
[1:37:01] your hand you'll start making decisions
[1:37:03] about things that you see right here and
[1:37:06] let me tell you something there is
[1:37:07] nothing in this world that's worth
[1:37:09] living for right now the pleasures of
[1:37:12] sin are but for a season
[1:37:16] it's just for a moment the Bible said
[1:37:18] life is but a vapor it passes by so
[1:37:22] quickly so you're not living for this
[1:37:24] moment you live for that world that's to
[1:37:27] come
[1:37:28] that's why brother Banner will make a
[1:37:30] statement like this he says as soon he
[1:37:32] said if you get into a church and hear a
[1:37:34] life you know and God's not really you
[1:37:36] to come to a place where that life is so
[1:37:37] settled out they're going to start
[1:37:39] looking at another place well they let
[1:37:40] the women cut hair over there they let
[1:37:42] them do this they do that and brother
[1:37:43] Adam said that paralyzes your faith
[1:37:45] because you start looking at other
[1:37:46] things you see what it is when you can
[1:37:48] look from church to church and compare
[1:37:50] Church to church that's because you
[1:37:51] never met Jesus I can't just say it very
[1:37:54] plain because once you ever meet the
[1:37:57] Lord God you meet the Lord Jesus let me
[1:37:59] tell you something there ain't no
[1:38:01] question if this message is the truth or
[1:38:03] not it's no question if it's Jesus
[1:38:05] Christ or not it's been made real in
[1:38:08] your life and let me tell you something
[1:38:09] he is enthroned in your heart over every
[1:38:13] devil over every Demon's sin has lost
[1:38:16] its hold there ain't enough Devils out
[1:38:18] of Torment that can ever take it out of
[1:38:21] your life
[1:38:24] hour of this revelation
[1:38:26] how do you do
[1:38:31] well you know even here this morning and
[1:38:33] no matter where a life is at you know
[1:38:35] how you make decisions brother Graham
[1:38:37] said there's a spirit in you that made a
[1:38:41] choice and he said the reason that
[1:38:42] spirit in you made the choice is because
[1:38:45] there was another spirit standing by you
[1:38:47] called the spirit of God that said raise
[1:38:50] your hand
[1:38:52] now I tell you that's how we start our
[1:38:53] journey but that's how it is with every
[1:38:56] single moment of our journey where the
[1:38:58] Holy Spirit it'll speak to our life and
[1:39:00] say this is for you it's coming right
[1:39:02] down your alley how many ever have
[1:39:04] things where you're maybe praying about
[1:39:05] and looking at and all of a sudden the
[1:39:07] holy spirit will come right down in a
[1:39:08] service he'll sweep right by it may not
[1:39:10] even been the exact words that you had
[1:39:12] on your heart are praying about but when
[1:39:14] that is finished there has been a
[1:39:17] relieving of like an oppression a Gloom
[1:39:19] a darkness and a how am I going to get
[1:39:22] through this right here what has
[1:39:23] happened there the spirit of God has
[1:39:27] come with the influence from another
[1:39:28] realm and the spirit inside of you has
[1:39:32] agreed with it and as a Son of God you
[1:39:35] are led by the spirit of God it leads
[1:39:37] you out of the darkness
[1:39:40] who glory be to God in the house and the
[1:39:43] influences Upon Our Life to make
[1:39:46] decisions you see Moses endured by
[1:39:49] seeing him that is invisible
[1:39:52] that's why there's a there's another
[1:39:55] realm that's real right here that's why
[1:39:57] that's why the Rapture ain't a place far
[1:40:00] off
[1:40:00] that's why Jesus ain't far off he's
[1:40:02] right here
[1:40:04] not in a corporate body he's right here
[1:40:06] that's why brother Brown said I cannot
[1:40:07] believe there's a house way I Yonder I
[1:40:09] believe if that house that God was
[1:40:10] speaking of is right here present right
[1:40:12] now what's he talking about Matthew
[1:40:15] it's not way out there
[1:40:17] we're seated in Heavenly places in
[1:40:20] Christ Jesus
[1:40:23] the Holy Ghost has come to tie you back
[1:40:26] in to your representation
[1:40:29] what is it it has come to do away with
[1:40:32] the chasm there's one standing in the
[1:40:36] Gap there is one who filled the breach
[1:40:39] there is one who have made up the Hedge
[1:40:41] who is it it is none other than Christ
[1:40:44] himself that has put his hands upon your
[1:40:47] life and it ties you right back into the
[1:40:50] word
[1:40:52] thank you
[1:40:53] brother Branson right here pressing with
[1:40:55] us now he said that's a place where the
[1:40:58] Mortal beings when we cease from this
[1:41:00] Miller mortal realm we step into
[1:41:02] immortality Yonder into a place and I
[1:41:05] believe that's where Jesus is today the
[1:41:07] resurrected Lord Jesus not out yonder
[1:41:09] somewhere a million miles away but right
[1:41:12] here pressing with us now
[1:41:15] you might say brother Samuel what does
[1:41:17] that have to do with me right now he
[1:41:19] ain't going to come any closer than what
[1:41:21] he is right now then let me tell you he
[1:41:24] said I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:41:27] end of the age
[1:41:29] he ain't just with you when you're in
[1:41:32] church
[1:41:33] he surrounds your life to influence your
[1:41:36] life to guide your life to move upon
[1:41:38] your life brother Samuel I hadn't even
[1:41:40] received the Holy Ghost yet let him keep
[1:41:43] on influence in your life and give
[1:41:45] yourself to the holy spirit that you
[1:41:48] keep on bumping into
[1:41:50] but let you know it deals with your life
[1:41:52] it bumps into your life calls things out
[1:41:54] of your heart what is it you're bumping
[1:41:56] into that realm that's right here that's
[1:41:59] more real than all the negative and
[1:42:01] doubtful thoughts sure
[1:42:04] brother Branson and soul is the
[1:42:07] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ right here
[1:42:09] he said it just like that fourth
[1:42:10] dimension where all them rays and like
[1:42:13] even of this of this right here you're
[1:42:15] hearing me through that voice but I have
[1:42:17] no connection to the system it's all
[1:42:19] waves these things are tuned right in I
[1:42:22] have this thing tuned right in set to a
[1:42:24] certain channel it's set on that to pick
[1:42:26] it up I have to set that and I have to
[1:42:28] set this by this mic pack and then you
[1:42:30] know what it does what is coming through
[1:42:32] here gets processed it's a wireless
[1:42:34] signal from here to there you say how
[1:42:36] can that pick it up it's built to
[1:42:39] receive the signal you could hook up
[1:42:41] another wireless unit this one right
[1:42:43] here is a sure you might hook up an AKG
[1:42:45] or hook up another one it wouldn't
[1:42:47] matter it will not work because it's got
[1:42:49] to work with the same brand it's got to
[1:42:51] be kind after kind and you see only this
[1:42:54] kind can pick up this kind and that's
[1:42:57] why the Lord Jesus only those of his
[1:42:59] kind can pick up the word of God there's
[1:43:03] something that's why Jesus said he could
[1:43:05] talk to the Pharisees and say hey he
[1:43:07] said you cannot receive me you do not
[1:43:10] you are not delighting in the word may
[1:43:12] manifest as your father Abraham did
[1:43:14] because ye Rejoice to see my day and he
[1:43:18] was glad but you have not the word
[1:43:21] abiding in you good Great China and he
[1:43:25] said what you are influenced from
[1:43:27] another Realm
[1:43:29] because that's the kind that's being
[1:43:31] influenced by kind
[1:43:33] right I'll say let me tell you something
[1:43:35] this morning what a privilege it is to
[1:43:37] be able to be influenced by the spirit
[1:43:39] of God
[1:43:40] and like when real influence comes it
[1:43:42] never leaves us where it finds us but
[1:43:44] Lord I want to move with that influence
[1:43:46] no matter if it's repentance water
[1:43:48] baptism Lord clean my life up fill me
[1:43:50] with the Holy Ghost Lord make me more
[1:43:52] like you I want to move under the
[1:43:54] influence of that other Realm I don't
[1:43:56] want to live under that that realm of
[1:43:58] influence that says you're all right
[1:43:59] here but you're good uh you know
[1:44:01] everything's all right not because that
[1:44:03] ending God coming to encourage me to
[1:44:04] settle down this is not the hour of
[1:44:06] settling down this is the hour to eat
[1:44:08] the Passover with the staff in your
[1:44:10] hands shoes on your feet loins girded
[1:44:12] and it's ready to go at a moment's
[1:44:14] notice
[1:44:15] brother Brown said here is the Lord
[1:44:17] Jesus standing in this room right here
[1:44:19] but the reason you can't see it is
[1:44:20] because your heart hasn't become tuned
[1:44:23] down to it
[1:44:24] you know I've looked at that quote many
[1:44:26] times and been thinking about how
[1:44:27] brother Brown will talk about how he'll
[1:44:29] go on to say you said like television
[1:44:31] picture she explains it being tuned down
[1:44:33] he said now television pictures our
[1:44:34] bodies are not set as instruments to
[1:44:36] pick it up but when our body becomes in
[1:44:37] tune with God becomes a part of him then
[1:44:40] our soul can pick up the power of the
[1:44:42] Holy Ghost to vindicate the presence of
[1:44:44] the Lord Jesus in all his power and
[1:44:46] omnipotence
[1:44:48] powerful tune down
[1:44:51] how do you become tuned down humbling
[1:44:53] ourselves to his voice
[1:44:57] the world is going so fast so fast so
[1:45:00] fast so fast everything was and what the
[1:45:02] spirit of God comes to speak to our
[1:45:03] lives to do what tune us down
[1:45:07] bring us back in tune I
[1:45:10] there's all sorts of frequencies trying
[1:45:12] to get at us
[1:45:14] wanting us to be in tune here and in
[1:45:16] tune there and in tune there and we go
[1:45:19] through and we feel all of those
[1:45:20] different pressures let me let me move
[1:45:22] on here just just real quickly to get
[1:45:24] get into this place here you realize
[1:45:27] that the Bible says it said he endured
[1:45:30] Moses endured
[1:45:32] now anybody knows when you say to endure
[1:45:34] something what does that mean
[1:45:36] gonna be some hardships right
[1:45:39] there's going to be some things or some
[1:45:40] real obstacles Moses endured
[1:45:43] as seeing him that is invisible now his
[1:45:45] Faith's been anointed
[1:45:48] but there's going to be some opposition
[1:45:49] some things that's going to come that's
[1:45:52] going to challenge that Faith but you
[1:45:55] know what it does it only shows
[1:45:57] that Faith that's already there
[1:45:59] it shows that it's something that cannot
[1:46:02] be overthrown
[1:46:04] that's why brother Brandon would make a
[1:46:05] statement he would say when a man ever
[1:46:07] catches a vision
[1:46:09] of the invisible God
[1:46:12] it stabilizes that man
[1:46:15] it'll stabilize him to know he's always
[1:46:17] prescient looking at the Unseen it
[1:46:20] stabilizes his actions in the time of
[1:46:23] distress and trouble it'll make him look
[1:46:25] upward and above the things that are
[1:46:28] happening around him
[1:46:30] because he's looking at the Unseen yet
[1:46:34] by promise would you turn in your Bibles
[1:46:36] with me I don't have this wrote down but
[1:46:37] I want you to go in your Bibles real
[1:46:39] quick now just just skip it I think we
[1:46:42] are aware
[1:46:44] the Lord just pressing these things on
[1:46:45] my heart
[1:46:47] once you go to Exodus 5
[1:46:52] and I want you to look at verse
[1:46:54] 22 and 23 with me
[1:46:57] now here's Moses after he's come
[1:47:01] from out of the burning bush
[1:47:03] or come out and he's went back into
[1:47:06] Egypt with a message
[1:47:10] and here he is standing here veiling the
[1:47:12] pillar of Fire
[1:47:14] God has told him
[1:47:16] you're going to be a god
[1:47:19] in other words you'll be speaking with
[1:47:22] an authority that comes
[1:47:24] from another Realm
[1:47:27] they're going to look at your life and
[1:47:28] all they'll see is a mortal man
[1:47:31] Pharaoh is going to see a man who's got
[1:47:34] older but remember what he was like in
[1:47:36] his high school days he's only going to
[1:47:38] see you as a mortal
[1:47:41] but you have met
[1:47:44] the god
[1:47:45] of your fathers
[1:47:47] and there you are veiling the invisible
[1:47:50] God
[1:47:52] remember Moses right there in the
[1:47:54] presence of God at the burning bush
[1:47:55] remember hearing all his human
[1:47:57] weaknesses they are exposed in the
[1:48:00] presence of God God's not even having to
[1:48:02] call them out God's not even saying hey
[1:48:05] you can't talk real good
[1:48:06] and in that Moses everything
[1:48:09] he puts before God at that moment of why
[1:48:14] he's not going to be able to do it
[1:48:18] but you know what's happening if we
[1:48:21] could see it Moses is actually emptying
[1:48:24] up
[1:48:26] and that's all God wanted him to do
[1:48:29] he got him in the prince of God got him
[1:48:30] to a place
[1:48:32] to where he could just empty up
[1:48:36] I I just believe with all my heart God
[1:48:38] help me help us
[1:48:42] that we can turn aside
[1:48:44] when we come into services like this we
[1:48:46] come in throughout the Let It Be moments
[1:48:48] we can turn aside
[1:48:50] to where if there's been
[1:48:52] some conglomerations of the world and
[1:48:54] I'm talking about thoughts on our minds
[1:48:56] and everything else you know the the the
[1:48:58] the pressures but we can turn aside
[1:49:02] and our vision can be renewed
[1:49:06] I believe that's a place that we're at
[1:49:09] I want you to watch here here he goes
[1:49:11] down into Egypt in these two verses
[1:49:15] and Moses returned unto the Lord
[1:49:18] now this is after they stood before
[1:49:19] pharaoh
[1:49:21] and Moses has declared everything
[1:49:22] through Aaron
[1:49:25] remember what Pharaoh said to him he
[1:49:26] said hey you guys got too much time on
[1:49:28] your hands
[1:49:29] we're going to fill up your time you see
[1:49:31] who's trying to fill your time up
[1:49:34] it isn't God it's the enemy
[1:49:37] right
[1:49:38] and so to understand with that right
[1:49:40] there say God give me the wisdom
[1:49:43] that I'm not doing wtas
[1:49:46] now those you're not teachers you don't
[1:49:48] know wtas are near the end of the school
[1:49:50] year
[1:49:50] they're called waste of time activities
[1:49:59] seriously
[1:50:01] but you're trying to make things so
[1:50:02] productive like you're you know grades
[1:50:05] and everything else and I should have
[1:50:06] had young people close their ears
[1:50:08] first but uh I think it's a little
[1:50:10] different in middle school and high
[1:50:11] school I know that but you know as you
[1:50:13] get at any at any rate there's there's
[1:50:14] things that
[1:50:16] Pharaoh wants to Soul bombard and I'm
[1:50:18] telling you the spirits of this age
[1:50:20] wants to bombard Our Lives
[1:50:25] listen even with this Moses came down
[1:50:28] here Moses has been told by God
[1:50:30] everything that's going to happen and
[1:50:31] then here Pharaoh says you got too much
[1:50:33] time on your hands
[1:50:37] so we're going to try to take up some of
[1:50:39] your time you know why
[1:50:40] if we can get your mind
[1:50:43] off of victory and off of the promises
[1:50:46] of God you'll lose sight of it
[1:50:50] and the very thing when more came
[1:50:52] towards him what did they do
[1:50:53] they turned on Moses
[1:50:55] what in the world
[1:50:58] you come down here
[1:51:00] and you're a trumpet
[1:51:01] stir up all this disturbance against us
[1:51:05] right
[1:51:06] look what look what Moses said verse 22
[1:51:08] and Moses returned unto the Lord and
[1:51:11] said Lord wherefore hast thou so evil
[1:51:14] entreated this people wow
[1:51:17] why is it that thou Hast sent me
[1:51:20] for since I came to pharaoh to speak in
[1:51:23] thy name he hath done evil to this
[1:51:26] people neither has thou delivered thy
[1:51:30] people
[1:51:31] at all
[1:51:35] but here's what I want you to notice
[1:51:37] he didn't take off running to the desert
[1:51:41] he had met God
[1:51:44] and even though God told him I'm going
[1:51:46] to harden Pharaoh's heart God already
[1:51:48] told him all this right
[1:51:50] but now Moses is in a place he doesn't
[1:51:54] know what's taking place see friends it
[1:51:56] shows you and I that even when we can
[1:51:58] receive a clear word from the Lord
[1:52:01] sometimes our thoughts about how things
[1:52:04] are going to be are not how God has in
[1:52:09] mind at all
[1:52:10] and that's what's going on with Moses
[1:52:13] right now
[1:52:14] Lord how about you send me down here
[1:52:17] I thought we I thought we was gonna I
[1:52:19] thought there was going to be delivered
[1:52:21] it's going to happen where he's going to
[1:52:23] say let's take up their time
[1:52:26] but he goes to the right source
[1:52:29] and if you'll notice the very next verse
[1:52:32] Exodus 6.
[1:52:34] then the Lord said unto Moses now shalt
[1:52:36] thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for
[1:52:39] with a strong hand shall he let them go
[1:52:41] and with a strong hand shall he drive
[1:52:43] him out of this land and God spake unto
[1:52:45] Moses and sent unto him I am the Lord
[1:52:49] and I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac
[1:52:53] watch this and unto Jacob by the name of
[1:52:56] God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was
[1:53:00] I not known to them
[1:53:02] what does Jehovah mean one who is
[1:53:06] existing right here with his family
[1:53:09] Moses you feel all alone but I'm right
[1:53:12] here with you
[1:53:14] I didn't save you I didn't give you an
[1:53:17] experience and then turn you on
[1:53:19] autopilot I'm right here governing in
[1:53:23] the Affairs of men I'm right here with
[1:53:26] you I'm your comforter Moses when a
[1:53:29] problem comes you don't understand run
[1:53:32] to me Moses
[1:53:33] talk to me Moses
[1:53:36] when things don't make sense talk to me
[1:53:39] but you'll read right here these two
[1:53:41] verses of scripture that we read you'll
[1:53:44] never find in anywhere else where Moses
[1:53:46] ever went to God like that again
[1:53:50] you know why he needed that moment
[1:53:53] to stabilize him
[1:53:55] brother Aaron it don't mean the pressure
[1:53:57] didn't come because here came one
[1:53:59] miracle
[1:54:01] Pharaoh's heart was heartened another
[1:54:03] one hardened another one hardened
[1:54:06] the more listen to me I'm closing the
[1:54:09] more Moses yielded
[1:54:12] to the voice of God in obedience the
[1:54:15] Lord spake unto Moses say this the Lord
[1:54:18] spake unto Moses do this the Lord what
[1:54:20] was he doing he was saying what the
[1:54:22] spirit was saying to say
[1:54:25] can we preach this for a minute that's
[1:54:27] why it's important he's the high priest
[1:54:28] of your profession that's why it's
[1:54:30] important when the word is coming and it
[1:54:32] speaks to your heart say what the spirit
[1:54:36] is saying
[1:54:38] say exactly no matter what you feel say
[1:54:40] exactly what it says
[1:54:43] the more Moses yielded in obedience
[1:54:46] the more it hardened pharaoh
[1:54:51] you wonder why things sometimes rise up
[1:54:53] against you rise up against us or things
[1:54:54] sometimes blind said you wonder why
[1:54:56] sometimes that is
[1:54:58] because there's a vessel of Mercy you
[1:55:00] yield more to the mercy of God and it
[1:55:02] only hardens
[1:55:04] others
[1:55:06] it hardens
[1:55:08] but it brings me to this statement right
[1:55:10] here
[1:55:12] and I'm going to read this here and I
[1:55:13] know I've said I'm closing I am on this
[1:55:14] brother REM says this two different
[1:55:15] times but yes last Sunday morning early
[1:55:17] when I was praying and the Lord dropped
[1:55:19] us in for this week here and this quote
[1:55:22] you're familiar with how many of you
[1:55:23] heard the state where brother Brian says
[1:55:25] when he talks about Moses he said I'm so
[1:55:27] glad that a man can live so close to God
[1:55:29] until the devil don't know what to do
[1:55:31] with it remember that brother Brown says
[1:55:32] in by faith Moses and also why Christ
[1:55:34] speak
[1:55:35] but he says it like this he said God
[1:55:38] plagued pharaoh with the voice of Moses
[1:55:44] I'm telling you you have been anointed
[1:55:46] to speak
[1:55:49] Samson was anointed to speak Joshua was
[1:55:53] anointed to speak Abigail when she did
[1:55:57] everything that was right and her
[1:55:59] husband her first husband was still
[1:56:01] living she went and put herself down in
[1:56:05] Repentance before David and then when
[1:56:08] David said Mercy has been found she went
[1:56:11] back to her first husband and said
[1:56:13] you're as good as a dead man what did
[1:56:15] she do she spoke the word
[1:56:18] and nabel's heart
[1:56:21] dropped within him
[1:56:23] you've been anointed to speak the word
[1:56:25] of God
[1:56:27] Anointed with the voice of God in your
[1:56:30] life to plague pharaoh
[1:56:33] well brother Samuel I don't feel I know
[1:56:35] there's some real super sometimes super
[1:56:37] spiritual feeling moments where we can
[1:56:39] speak some things and there's some other
[1:56:41] times where you don't feel so super
[1:56:43] spiritually anointed but you're speaking
[1:56:46] it because it is the word of God
[1:56:50] let the redeemed of the Lord say so
[1:56:56] say what the word has said about me
[1:56:59] and devil if you want to stick around go
[1:57:02] ahead and stick around and maybe I'm
[1:57:04] going to have this praise break in front
[1:57:06] of you I am going to rejoice in the
[1:57:09] table that is prepared for me in the
[1:57:12] presence of my enemies oh brother random
[1:57:14] say when you get to rejoicing in the
[1:57:16] presence of your enemies your cut begins
[1:57:19] to run over I am going to invite the
[1:57:23] presence of almighty God
[1:57:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:28] let's stand
[1:57:31] let me finish this
[1:57:36] fleas lies frog smoke
[1:57:39] he done everything till finally favor
[1:57:41] had to say get out
[1:57:45] is that the kind of testimony you want
[1:57:47] the devil to have about you
[1:57:50] we don't want the devil to have the
[1:57:51] testimony oh you don't want to worry
[1:57:52] about them they won't bother you
[1:57:55] wow they're all right just got to hit
[1:57:56] him with a little thought here and there
[1:57:57] and he'll be all right the rest they'll
[1:57:58] just they'll comb right down they'll
[1:58:00] settle right down no we need to press
[1:58:02] through that Darkness
[1:58:04] press through it with life what do you
[1:58:06] keep doing keep pecking at it keep
[1:58:07] chopping at it keep chopping at it keep
[1:58:08] chopping at it keep chopping at it keep
[1:58:10] chopping at it
[1:58:13] I'm talking about everyday living
[1:58:15] and I'm so glad
[1:58:17] that a man can so completely serve God
[1:58:21] till the devil don't know what to do
[1:58:24] with him
[1:58:25] completely it just means what he says
[1:58:29] I say
[1:58:31] My Confession that's what his confession
[1:58:33] is
[1:58:34] what is that that's a man that the devil
[1:58:37] don't know what to do with
[1:58:39] when you rely upon what the Holy Spirit
[1:58:42] has spoke to your heart and made you you
[1:58:45] rely upon the word the word comes and it
[1:58:47] corrects your life and you say Lord
[1:58:48] forgive me Lord I'm ready to rise up
[1:58:51] what is it it's one who is surrendering
[1:58:53] into the hands of God and the devil said
[1:58:55] I thought I could keep him trapped in
[1:58:57] that I thought I could keep them bound
[1:58:58] with that right there but realizing
[1:59:00] you're Rising
[1:59:02] under the influence of another Realm
[1:59:05] he just obeyed God so completely
[1:59:08] till the devil said get away
[1:59:12] I don't want to hear it no more
[1:59:18] brother Branham said you can do it
[1:59:22] so completely
[1:59:25] how many of you know words create an
[1:59:27] atmosphere
[1:59:29] the words we speak create an atmosphere
[1:59:33] oh my let us say what the spirit is
[1:59:36] saying
[1:59:37] when the spirit says repent I want to
[1:59:39] repent
[1:59:40] when the spirit brings it says speaks of
[1:59:42] cleansing we want cleansing when the
[1:59:44] spirit speaks of the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:46] Ghost that's what to move into when the
[1:59:48] holy spirit says hey there's more for
[1:59:50] you there's more for me Lord God I want
[1:59:53] to go deeper
[1:59:55] to such a place to will Pharaoh the
[1:59:58] world finally says get out of here
[2:00:01] get out of here
[2:00:04] oh God help us
[2:00:08] let's pray
[2:00:09] father
[2:00:12] Lord I'm sure that every one of us
[2:00:16] no matter Lord where we
[2:00:18] would be at Lord right here this morning
[2:00:20] but God to be able to identify him
[2:00:23] with your word
[2:00:25] to be able or to
[2:00:27] have that objective that desire Lord and
[2:00:30] that within our lives
[2:00:32] to live so completely
[2:00:35] in your hands the Lord
[2:00:37] father in every one of these stages that
[2:00:40] we looked at like in Moses life
[2:00:42] there was Faith all along
[2:00:45] and Lord I didn't realize that sitting
[2:00:46] right here this morning
[2:00:48] and I'm certain Lord here and maybe
[2:00:50] streaming lives it's never maybe crossed
[2:00:53] all the way into that promise of the
[2:00:56] Holy Ghost where their faith has been
[2:00:57] anointed
[2:00:58] but father right here that faith
[2:01:02] that already would lay within them is
[2:01:04] being cultivated to a place to believe
[2:01:07] you for all things
[2:01:08] to realize that there's there's nothing
[2:01:11] no matter what kind of scarecrow or what
[2:01:14] the devil would want to ever try to put
[2:01:15] before him to try to hinder them
[2:01:17] but Lord God may they Lord rise
[2:01:21] with the authority in that word and to
[2:01:22] look to look Beyond present
[2:01:25] circumstances
[2:01:27] not to allow
[2:01:29] the world
[2:01:31] to take their eyes
[2:01:33] their attention their focus
[2:01:37] Lord I realize that every one of us we
[2:01:40] live in this world
[2:01:42] but we're not of it
[2:01:44] Paul would write of it that
[2:01:47] we would use this world
[2:01:49] without abusing it
[2:01:52] I pray that God that you would help
[2:01:54] every one of us
[2:01:57] maybe Lord and lives is like Moses
[2:02:01] he didn't go running back out into the
[2:02:03] desert
[2:02:04] there's times Lord were things that's
[2:02:06] been in our life
[2:02:09] that Lord God wants meeting you in that
[2:02:11] way that it stabilized us to know
[2:02:14] that you're always with us Moses didn't
[2:02:16] have to run back to the burning bush
[2:02:19] but the God that he met through that
[2:02:21] attraction
[2:02:23] was now dwelling with him and in him
[2:02:27] and all he had to do
[2:02:30] was go talk to you
[2:02:33] father
[2:02:34] it was a stabilizing in that moment
[2:02:38] and from then on when opposition arose
[2:02:41] Moses
[2:02:43] met that opposition
[2:02:46] by the standard of the word that was
[2:02:48] revealed
[2:02:49] call for fleas call for flies call for
[2:02:51] frogs
[2:02:53] he didn't even think how are fleas going
[2:02:55] to come how are flies going to come how
[2:02:56] are frogs going to come how he didn't he
[2:02:58] just he spoke it Lord
[2:03:02] now father it was you that stabilized
[2:03:05] him
[2:03:06] it's you that stabilizes your children
[2:03:08] [Music]
[2:03:10] and Lord I pray right here this morning
[2:03:13] may that be the confession from our
[2:03:14] lives Lord
[2:03:16] May our lives or be under that
[2:03:19] confession that
[2:03:20] yielded to you Lord we want to be
[2:03:23] so completely yielded to you
[2:03:26] to where the devil doesn't know what to
[2:03:28] do with us oh there's traps that's sure
[2:03:30] there's always a contest that's on
[2:03:32] always a battle that's going on the
[2:03:35] battle itself Lord does does not mean
[2:03:37] does not mean that Lord we're not
[2:03:39] yielded but the battle itself is to try
[2:03:41] to pull us
[2:03:44] out from under the influence of that
[2:03:46] Realm
[2:03:47] but may we lord God I pray this morning
[2:03:49] if there's one thing that Lord God is
[2:03:52] lives and hearts can be gathered here
[2:03:53] this morning to realize
[2:03:56] we'll never ever live Victorious with
[2:03:59] all the opposition that is in this realm
[2:04:02] if we walk and live
[2:04:04] by the visible
[2:04:07] but the way that we overcome
[2:04:09] is by faith
[2:04:11] it's the Lord God
[2:04:14] as Moses would look to you and surrender
[2:04:16] himself
[2:04:17] then his life became a channel
[2:04:20] and victory moved through
[2:04:22] each situation
[2:04:25] what I'd love to be able to stand here
[2:04:27] in in one way
[2:04:31] I'm sure all of us would to say
[2:04:33] we've never made mistakes we've never
[2:04:36] been out of the influence of that realm
[2:04:39] or but Lord
[2:04:42] there's times that we have
[2:04:46] Lord God where we've asked you to
[2:04:48] forgive us and maybe right here this
[2:04:49] morning
[2:04:50] hearts Lord that would just in this
[2:04:53] tenderness and sweetness of your
[2:04:54] presence
[2:04:55] or maybe all those wrongs have been made
[2:04:57] right but maybe it's an opportunity
[2:04:59] right here to say Lord
[2:05:01] I want to just come back under that
[2:05:03] influence Lord
[2:05:04] [Music]
[2:05:05] I want that the influence of that other
[2:05:07] Realm of the Holy Ghost to guide and
[2:05:10] direct me Lord
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:12] every decision Lord help me help me to
[2:05:15] weigh everything
[2:05:17] in the balance of the word not to look
[2:05:19] at it not to even entertain my feelings
[2:05:23] but let me weigh it
[2:05:25] with the word of God
[2:05:27] granted Lord right here this morning
[2:05:30] we Face the Lord our jobs face
[2:05:31] everything that's around us family life
[2:05:33] Lord home life Lord
[2:05:36] jobs every situation Lord marriage on
[2:05:40] and on and on
[2:05:41] oh God
[2:05:43] we look to the Unseen this morning Lord
[2:05:47] this is where Lord we receive our
[2:05:49] strength
[2:05:51] this is what stabilizes us like it did
[2:05:54] Elisha
[2:05:55] when by the word of God he had already
[2:05:58] met you
[2:06:00] and though Elisha did not see them
[2:06:02] angels
[2:06:03] but he had a confidence he knew the god
[2:06:07] that it had been placed in the word
[2:06:10] that the angels of God are encamped
[2:06:12] around about them
[2:06:14] that fear Him and love him
[2:06:16] but he could pray he knew they were
[2:06:19] there he had a confidence in the word
[2:06:21] Lord
[2:06:22] that's what your Prophet told us Lord
[2:06:24] and look into the Unseen he had a
[2:06:26] confidence in the word that he could
[2:06:28] pray
[2:06:29] and you would loosen gehaza's eyes to
[2:06:31] where gehaza could see him
[2:06:34] now Lord
[2:06:36] I'm sure standing right here this
[2:06:37] morning
[2:06:39] maybe there's a situation there's a need
[2:06:43] May eyes be loosed
[2:06:45] to see
[2:06:46] the invisible God who's present
[2:06:49] mindful
[2:06:51] of our need mindful
[2:06:53] of the condition in our life mindful of
[2:06:56] situations
[2:06:58] oh granted Lord
[2:07:00] and yield yield to the word of God
[2:07:04] granted Lord You're our stabilizer
[2:07:07] you're our stabilizer Lord You're our
[2:07:10] strength
[2:07:12] Lord God our flesh the weakness of our
[2:07:15] flesh
[2:07:16] but there is such a stability that comes
[2:07:19] Lord
[2:07:19] in our lives because of you
[2:07:23] not because of us but because of you
[2:07:26] may we stand like Moses Lord May our
[2:07:30] voice
[2:07:31] be a plague to this world
[2:07:35] may it Lord him that it's a plague to
[2:07:37] the world may it be Lord is Mercy coming
[2:07:39] through
[2:07:40] to others Lord God
[2:07:43] sons and daughters that are still caught
[2:07:45] in this conglomeration of sin and
[2:07:48] darkness may it be a voice that
[2:07:51] proclaims Jubilee Liberty overcoming
[2:07:55] granted Lord through our lives through
[2:07:57] our actions through our speech Lord
[2:08:00] granted father we pray
[2:08:02] in Jesus name
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:06] amen influenced by another Realm
[2:08:10] that's the realm I want to live by
[2:08:13] that realm been birthed by that Spirit
[2:08:16] that's where realm I want to live by
[2:08:18] on and on example is on and on Parts in
[2:08:20] the word but everyday life every day
[2:08:23] every day life
[2:08:24] we want to be influenced
[2:08:27] by that other Realm
[2:08:31] Hallelujah
[2:08:32] aren't you glad
[2:08:35] you know I'm glad God never gave up on
[2:08:37] me
[2:08:40] I'm glad God don't give up on none of
[2:08:42] his children
[2:08:43] God never gave up on Moses
[2:08:47] because Moses was a part of him
[2:08:50] and I just said you know as I've just
[2:08:53] looking and studying and moving through
[2:08:54] a lot of these things one thing that
[2:08:56] just so so oppressed upon my heart
[2:09:00] is one of the biggest lies sometimes
[2:09:03] that Satan wants to try to tell our
[2:09:06] young people middle age and I find it a
[2:09:09] lot among young people as though
[2:09:11] you don't have nothing until you get the
[2:09:13] Holy Ghost that ain't true
[2:09:16] Moses had these great qualities in him
[2:09:21] they had to be anointed by God
[2:09:25] the majority of our texts that we read
[2:09:27] out of Hebrews 11 was about a man before
[2:09:31] the holy ghost ever came
[2:09:33] he chose not to be a son of pharaoh why
[2:09:38] he was under the influence of another
[2:09:41] Realm and that's why I say that no
[2:09:44] matter where you're at in your journey
[2:09:46] let your life every one of us be
[2:09:49] influenced by the Holy Ghost what is it
[2:09:53] making a step closer
[2:09:55] until finally
[2:09:58] you stand there
[2:10:00] United
[2:10:01] with almighty God and then you know what
[2:10:03] you keep on uniting you keep on uniting
[2:10:06] you grow deeper and you grow deeper and
[2:10:07] you grow deeper you go stronger more and
[2:10:09] more and more and more and more like him
[2:10:12] because your new birth
[2:10:13] you're not born a mature son and
[2:10:16] daughter of God
[2:10:19] we're birthed
[2:10:20] and then we grow
[2:10:22] we develop
[2:10:24] we grow we develop
[2:10:27] we have stumblings but we grow and we
[2:10:30] develop and there's something that
[2:10:32] pulsates within us Amen to the word of
[2:10:34] God
[2:10:35] so be it Lord
[2:10:38] we have a witness in our life that
[2:10:40] there's something
[2:10:42] changed me I didn't change myself I
[2:10:45] wanted to change I I knew I needed him
[2:10:46] but I didn't change myself he changed me
[2:10:50] what is it that's the real sacred sins
[2:10:53] of God's grace
[2:10:57] don't you love him
[2:10:58] oh my I want to be
[2:11:01] so completely

[2:18:50] thank you
[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:04] I'd like to see
[2:19:06] [Music]
[2:19:13] world
[2:19:15] to this world
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:30] we have
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:19:53] it
[2:19:55] is
[2:19:55] [Music]
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:19] before
[2:20:22] so much
[2:20:27] [Music]
[2:20:41] [Applause]
[2:20:46] step of the way
[2:20:48] no matter where you're at in God
[2:20:50] remember it always takes faith
[2:20:54] he that cometh to God must first believe
[2:20:57] that he is
[2:20:58] Faith all along
[2:21:01] and God anoints that Faith then there's
[2:21:04] the invisible God behind that Faith
[2:21:05] motivating it
[2:21:07] and that's where we rely on
[2:21:09] like we looked at on Thursday night we
[2:21:11] don't rely on our reasonings
[2:21:13] we don't rely on our outside realm we've
[2:21:16] been in contact with another Realm
[2:21:19] and our faith is Anointed there's an
[2:21:22] anchor and that's where John could say
[2:21:24] whosoever is born of God overcometh the
[2:21:27] world
[2:21:28] and to overcome means to prevail
[2:21:31] conquer carry off the victory so there's
[2:21:35] opposition
[2:21:36] but opposition only proves what's in you
[2:21:41] and whosoever is born of God overcometh
[2:21:44] the world and this is the victory even
[2:21:47] our faith
[2:21:51] faith is such a great thing
[2:21:54] faith is such a wonderful thing
[2:21:58] I'm so grateful
[2:22:00] I'm grateful for that influence
[2:22:02] from another Realm
[2:22:05] in this hour we live in the church world
[2:22:07] had it all sold sold up but God rent the
[2:22:10] Veil
[2:22:12] he rent The Veil that we now could come
[2:22:14] under the influence
[2:22:16] of that other Realm
[2:22:18] that he's the same yesterday today and
[2:22:21] forever
[2:22:23] we're not just coming to the rapture we
[2:22:26] are the rapture
[2:22:28] we're not just coming to a translation
[2:22:31] we're in the translation
[2:22:33] we've been translated from Death unto
[2:22:36] life and we keep on walking on with God
[2:22:39] where he leads me I'm gonna fall
[2:22:42] in every situation I'm going to let go
[2:22:45] of my own will in his presence Lord not
[2:22:48] mine will thine will be done
[2:22:52] it didn't mean that Moses didn't have
[2:22:56] troubles but Moses never questioned
[2:22:59] again
[2:23:00] why did you send me here
[2:23:03] but he stood right there and you know
[2:23:05] what God told him what to say
[2:23:08] sometimes you say Lord fill my mouth
[2:23:11] fill my mouth with what needs to be said
[2:23:13] here Lord sometimes I don't know what to
[2:23:16] say fill my mouth Lord
[2:23:18] and then do what speak for flies speak
[2:23:21] for fleas speak to that condition
[2:23:24] speak to that Gloom speak to that
[2:23:26] depression speak to that Temptation
[2:23:28] speak to that anxiety speak to other
[2:23:31] what are you doing you're speaking to
[2:23:34] everything that would rise up against
[2:23:37] the promise of God
[2:23:39] what are you doing you're yielding
[2:23:41] yourself to God you could I could we
[2:23:44] could all yield ourselves to our
[2:23:45] feelings because our feelings are real
[2:23:47] right
[2:23:49] but there's something more real than my
[2:23:51] feelings
[2:23:52] if I can just yield to that and say what
[2:23:54] he says say
[2:23:55] but the same I may not feel it yet
[2:23:58] I may not really fully believe it say it
[2:24:01] till you do believe it
[2:24:03] that's the words of the prophets
[2:24:05] say it till you do believe it
[2:24:08] and keep pecking at it keep punching at
[2:24:10] it
[2:24:12] oh my
[2:24:14] God what are you well
[2:24:16] you're a plague your voice is a plague
[2:24:18] to the devil
[2:24:20] because the devil trying to pour
[2:24:21] everything he can on you to try to get
[2:24:23] you discouraged and out here in this
[2:24:25] realm or in this realm you might feel
[2:24:27] you might feel down you have those
[2:24:29] feelings but on the inside there's
[2:24:30] something that's a bubbling and you just
[2:24:32] speak right out this is mine
[2:24:36] this is mine Gloom is not an atmosphere
[2:24:38] of a believer
[2:24:39] depression not mine anxiety not mine
[2:24:43] back trouble not mine
[2:24:46] hello somebody
[2:24:48] it's a voice coming against
[2:24:51] all of those things
[2:24:55] well I'll tell you we've been made more
[2:24:56] in conquerors
[2:24:59] if you just look into the mirror of what
[2:25:02] you are what God has made you look at it
[2:25:04] it'll build faith
[2:25:07] to pierce every Darkness
[2:25:09] you love him
[2:25:11] oh praise be to God
[2:25:14] praise be to God
[2:25:16] oh friends listen when we leave out of
[2:25:18] here and leave out of his presence
[2:25:20] we don't actually leave his presence we
[2:25:22] do it with one another
[2:25:24] but let's take this
[2:25:26] this is Victory
[2:25:28] this is Victory
