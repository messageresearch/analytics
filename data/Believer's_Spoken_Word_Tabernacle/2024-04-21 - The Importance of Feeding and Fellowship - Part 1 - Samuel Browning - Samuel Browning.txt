this Lord I don't even have the words or know the right words to say but I know that you are the alls sufficient one for this need or situation or whatever it might be Lord You're All Things Lord now father again that little boy who was in a field and that older man Lord had passed by and all he heard was this little boy saying his ABCs and they asked him the question he said what were you doing he said I was praying Lord that older gentleman said well all you were doing was saying the ABCs he said yes he said I didn't know what words to say but I just figured if I send up the letters he knew what was in my heart and he could put the words together Lord we love you this morning I'm so thankful that God that as Paul could write Lord even expressing of that Lord Assurance in our growth and our walk with you that Lord the spirit helpeth our infirmities Lord that God it Mak maketh groanings and intercessions Lord with groanings that cannot be uttered Lord father to know that as we're walking Lord as Priests of the Living God and Lord lives that have been redeemed Lord when our hearts Lord like you spoke to Joshua that Lord he would not depart from the word that Lord it would always be Lord that which would be in his mouth and he would meditate on it day and night Lord Lord that oh God as we look in your word Lord many times we look Lord at the word and we can look at ourselves but Lord I take the report of the word Lord God and just want to submit myself Lord to the word and come under the word because the word Lord is what will bring forth Lord from our lives Lord and to know that God that there is a spirit of intercession Lord that moves Lord in our hearts oh God to draw upon our high priest Lord from the throne of grace oh God to draw the strength that we have need of Lord down into our lives oh God to bring about Lord the change the Deliverance oh God the growth it's needed Lord this is our confidence Lord that you listen to our hearts Lord and oh God May that always be Lord this is our desire oh God like even David could say let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh God granted Lord we pray this morning Lord Lord may you just move Among Us Lord Lord come and speak to our hearts in a very special and personal way Lord May oh God you come Lord do exceedingly abundantly Lord above all that we can think or ask Lord and God every petition Lord that we have Lord the request Lord even if there's one Lord that maybe Lord we held back from writing or maybe it would just be something that we would keep on our heart before you Lord oh god with the courage this morning Lord may we lay it Lord upon the throne and altar of almighty God and Lord invite the fire of almighty God to move down oh God and to bring answers Lord Deliverance Lord Clarity Lord God oh Father may you just move Lord in a very special way Among Us Lord once again this morning Lord bless your children Lord as they've

Lord move in upon Lord and and to open the word we know that it'll take you Lord to open it to us Lord and anoint us and Inspire us oh God may we be lifted Lord Beyond this physical address Lord of Lake Breeze Road Lord God may we lord God be lifted in the Heavenly places Lord and to behold you father Lord plainly Lord granted Lord we ask it father in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen if you'll turn with me to Ruth chapter 2 amen I want to begin with verse eight there and want to say God bless you it's so good to see each and every one of you amen and I I always mean that it's good it's always good to come together amen and to Fellowship around the word of the Lord amen I certainly always believe and I know that God always has something very very personal for us and uh just as we're standing here we we certainly desire your prayers that God would help all of us to step aside these few moments that he gives us here Amen in Ruth chapter 2 and verse 8 and I want to just read a few of these verses just for a little background and uh as we're getting into the thought this morning and notice these are the first words I pick up in verse eight these are the first words that now that Ruth has had expressed or spoken to her from baz now she doesn't know who baz is she doesn't really even know the significance of what all of this is really about but she is simply as we read in here and we have been she is just simply basking in the grace of God that she has come to experience and to know in her life so here Boaz says to Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens and let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn how many appreciate refreshment amen I I really appreciate that then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in th thine eyes that thou should us take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger she knows who she is she knows that she knows these things and she's there's no covering up on it she just recognizing this is Grace you've spoken to me and called me your daughter a term of endearment why how have I found Grace in thine eyes and Boaz says unto her it hath been fully showed me all that thou Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not hither toor the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust then she said let me find favor in thy sight my Lord if you really look at the writing of it it's it's with a confession I believe I will find more favor in thy sight for thou Hast comforted me for thou Hast spoken friendly unto thine handmade though I be not like unto one of thine handmaids and this is where I want to BR move into this morning and bohas said unto her at mil time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to read to you a quote here this morning that brother brandom specifically speaking of this particular verse in the message and you you know this whole uh expression of Ruth it's all the way through the message what a what a a book that speaks of the Redemption and Redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ among his bride body it's a little book but within that little book there is a a woman who comes into Divine favor and as we see this within Ruth and all of this conect ction that's here brother Bram says it like this in the message Redeemer and Redemption and that recording along with that last scripture he said now when it comes the midday and you get tired and come over come over and sit down under the tree and take the morsel of bread and dip right in with the rest of them oh I like that that's Fellowship you see get around get right around under the shade tree don't you love to get under there and just dip right in with the rest of them that's so I want to continue that we've been looking at the thought on the value of obedience and that's kind of the overarching part but I want to deal with a subject here and I I'm going to ask you not to allow your mind to venture out into where you think I'm going to go this morning because even though I'm going to cover familiar territory but there's a way that I want us to look at these things and I want to speak on the thought of the importance of feeding Ing and fellowship the importance of feeding and fellowship I I look at this within Ruth and I you know I how you you Ponder upon these things many times she's a moabit background that she's come from that's known that word had traveled quickly because even the Reapers were able to tell Boaz when he asked who is this damsel that's right here they were a able to describe who she was and that she indeed was a moabitas what a what a a reputation to have upon her character or her name but you see underneath that that title of moabit there was a real character as a matter of fact when you go back and study in the scriptures you recognize that even when God came up to deal with with Moab in when misra was in their Journey God would not let every one of them be extinguished or taken out because there was a seed that was going to come forth by the name of Ruth so no matter how Bleak or uh it would be there was a character and I want you to remember when I read these scriptures here to open up that her character not only as moabit was known but something much greater her character was already standing out in before the Reapers and it was standing out before Boaz Boaz was taking notice of her character and Boaz was already seeing something in her that Ruth couldn't see in herself it would be like a person that comes to know the Lord Jesus as their lord and savior what a wonderful reality what a wonderful moment to feel when we have repented and experienced the Forgiveness of our sins and that load that's lifted off for all of the past sins where they've been remitted but Ruth doesn't realize that who she's standing in the presence of is not only her savior but he's her Redeemer he's her Kinsman that's good she doesn't see this but what's important is he already sees as the prophet said he already saw the character that was in her and he already had in his mind what he was going to do and you would ask and say well why didn't Boaz just move and just do that because he has to allow all of these things to play out out and has to allow the character that he's already begin to see exhibited where she left Nativity left father and mother left her land and came with her mother-in-law he wants that character to come to a full expression because you see even in this hour we're living in God doesn't marry an infant bride but God marries a mature woman God marries one in whom the character he knew has laid there the whole time but under the presence his presence under his word he brings forth or harvests out of our life that character that has laid there the whole time that part of himself but what's important is in how God allows this to play out and and this obedience and obedience is is a is a is is the is the very Catalyst of getting God's attention and you really we we can't obey with without faith the Bible said he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he goes on to say that how that that without faith it's impossible to please God so to understand that real obedience is simply just believing what God said it isn't about that I understand it or I can't explain it it's just simply saying Lord I take you at your word and you find that as we'll receive that just simple Faith because God has said it and we receive it obedience itself will work righteousness because there is a power in the word as we'll receive it it will change our lives from Glory unto glory and what an invitation she's had to come and fellowship with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith what an opportunity she hasn't been invited by a Reaper this is one who has taken notice of her character character and has said at meal time I want you to come and I want you to come and to eat and and take nourishment with us I want you to come and be a a partaker of this and so when here she comes and we see the approach that's made what an invitation to to be to come and to dine with the king I I can't think of even a a greater reality of even when you think of how that the Lord Jesus in the resurrection he would speak to the disciples and here he was on the shore and when Peter realized who it was I mean he wasn't walking on water that time he just jumped in the water he said I'm out of the boat I'm swimming to shore I I want to get to where he's at and this is where the Lord Jesus they hauling the fish and he says come and dine and fish are provided upon the fire and I want you to notice he had it provided before they ever got the rest of the fish to the land God had already provided for them he he was showing these things and and then we we look at it when you take with Peter and and getting into this aspect of feeding and so forth and and you seen of how that the disciples remember they had become uh all scattered when they things were not going the way that they sh thought it should be but the chief Shepherd the Bible said you smite the shepherd scatter the Sheep but the shepherd himself is obligated to go and gather the Sheep Hallelujah and he goes and he begins to gather them and then he comes to Peter and he asked Peter as Peter sitting here eating and he said Peter do you love me now he's asking him do you Agape me that's unconditional and Peter says Lord thou knowest I ailo Thee and Jesus said feed my Lambs then this conversation it goes once again repeat the third time the Bible says p Peter is grieved yes that he's asked the same question again you say how could Peter be grieved because of the form of love he's still setting in you see when we come into this Earth the highest form of love that we can know and I think it's wonderful it's a it's a form of love that that should be about in our homes is FAL love but what should be the main driving force of our life is agape love and agape love is the Holy Ghost that's why Paul could say that the Holy Ghost is the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost it's God that's what the Holy Spirit coming is is making known God's love for you what he did for you the way that's been made for you and you are always a part of him and God desires that you and I would serve him not not of oural love but of his love you see you and I could never get to Agape Love But agape love came down for you and I paid the price as he says the shepherd lays down his life for his sheep he made a way so that then that agape love coming into our lives now will be the influencer over our Fingal love cuz you still have Fingal love for your family yet Paul would write in the Ephesians 5 husbands Agape your wives even as Christ the church that's impossible without God 1 Corinthians 13 love is this and goes on and on that that cannot be attained to outside of God and US yielding to that love on the inside that's why when the Holy Ghost has come it it lifts it from just a a a h I'm doing this and I I this this is the right thing to do it it lifts it to where it's not even thought of as a obligation or a requirement it it's just it's a love affair right so the things that God has laid in your life and asked you to do it's like hey this is this is different than when I first started my journey it's it's not just me keeping away from things it's just Lord I I I just I want to please you see it's moved to a different depth because FAL love will fail you and I to try to serve God by FAL love the prophet will say it over and over and you see it FAL love when hard times come when pressures come FAL love doesn't have the strength to stand but agape love it has the strength because it's not based on our strength it's not based on the conditions of somebody else if somebody else is pleasing me or if there it's not it's an unconditional love yes sir you see that's is why we must have agape love to be the sole influence of our life that's why we must be born again and when the Lord Jesus is speaking to Peter here he's asking him three times feed my sheep now notice what he said to him feed my sheep he realizes when he's speaking to Peter Peter was still a selfish man Peter was still you we could go through events and I I don't have time to deal with that but what Jesus is letting it be known in is you you in the state that you're in now you're not able to feed my sheep you're not able to feed my Lambs you're not able to operate as as a as a as an unders sheeper you're not able to operate in that manner to actually feed because you're still too much wrapped up in Peter you see that's what the new birth is it delivers us of our own selfish will and it gives us a strength and a life and A Love Affair for God and for his word and for his people absolutely yes sir Hallelujah is that right it gives us a strength on the inside listen it's a strength like a garment where Paul could say put on therefore as the elect of God holy bows of Mercy put on means sink into sink into we've got a place we can Retreat a place we can let off the pressure a place that we can reside I'm not talking about out here I'm talking about in here we have a strength where the love of God and we can ask God lord I need more we should never don't ever be ashamed to ask God for more love when pressures come your way and situations tests trials whatever don't don't ever be ashamed to ask God for more love brother Samuel is that a sign that you know that I'm a weak Christian listen I would rather be weak as far is saying Lord I need you then be strong in my own self come on now that's right I want I want to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might how Ruth must have felt to have been invited to this setting my but how that God would speak here not only with Peter on the feeding and I want you to take of take notice of these words even as if Paul would write when Paul could see his his getting ready to depart and Paul would write of this in the scriptures in the book of Acts and speak of how I'm getting ready to depart from you but he said I want you he called the elders he called them to him there and he told him he says I want you to take heed to yourselves first and to the flock of God now notice how the order is to yourselves first and then to the flock of God you see uh even for a shepherd and this applies even when it comes husband father and whatever more we we see this even as we talk about the token we can never actually be effectually and work as in the operation or the or the position or what God wants us to do if we and ourselves are not taking heed to ourselves so at first of all Paul is speaking to the elders take heed to yourselves and to the flock so to be mindful of the flock over which the Lord hath made you overseers because you see any man that just makes himself and I'm talking about a man that just feels like you know well I you know what I I just can't sit under anybody else I I need to go start my own worker I need to go do that I tell you that's a dangerous situation to be in you say why because that Foundation is already wrong it's for the wrong purpose if there's a group that is to start it should be birthed out of or grow from it should be of a burden that begins there in that heart why that's for the Sheep cuz if it's not that same motive and objective even though that word's being preached Spirits attach to the word and what it does if a group if something is started under bitterness you watch there'll be a bitterness that starts there that's every denomination it's a bitterness against God's word so it matters what the motive is behind it so when we look at this take heed to yourselves and to the flock of God over which the Lord hath made thee overseer and to feed the flock of God once again this word feed the flock of God now when you think of this to to feed the prophet would tell us like this when it comes to feeding and I'm talking about Meal Time and notice how Ruth is gathering in with all of the Reapers this isn't just Ruth coming to a little shed by herself and Ruth getting in there and there's already some meal that's provided no coming together with the rest of us at meal time now notice this testing is being done here and when you find that how the prophet would speak about of now that the ministry is to work he said God God does not send man to rule over man but remember Paul said in the book of of Hebrews chapter 3 you know 13 we always remember verse 8 but verse 7 says remember them that have the rule over you whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation so in other words when we're looking at it it should be that faith that revelation we should see Christ and it should be Christ that we're following sure God uses men but the men the way God will use that man is a gift he's placed in that man's life to be able to get himself out of the way to get his thoughts out of the way and to depend on the leading of the chief Shepherd because every Pastor is a Shepherd but he's not the chief Shepherd the pastor is an Under Shepherd there's the chief Shepherd and the chief Shepherd is over all of that he's the one who's guiding and directing the UND sheeper words so that there is a flow and we're moving in the right and the same direction and the prophet would tell us that how that we are LED he said we we are LED as we feed on the word of God that's how God leads his church as we feed on the word of God now when you consider that and look at you think about it even in the terms of when you we think of Psalms 23 David would say the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he make me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters uh he anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over you know if I don't know how you thought about it but you know there's things as you begin to look at that he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures it would almost seem as though that a sheep is being brought into a place like this and from and from wall to wall is Lush thick grass but that is not at all according to Psalms 23 in the Eastern custom as a matter of fact the shepherd himself there are there are places that the Sheep will feed in certain seasons of the year the ultimate or the desire of every Shepherd is to be able to get the Sheep up to the table land and that table land will be a summer's worth of Journey but in order for the Sheep to go on that Journey the shepherd goes ahead of the sheep he clears out debris out of the Springs he removes that and the shepherd is able to move any hindrances out of the pathway cuz it's a rugged way that rugged way up to the table land which is a wonderful place where we can just lay down and and settle down right there wonderful place but in order to get there there's a lot of lot of hard tracks along the way but as there's hard tracks there is also sufficient nutrients in Plants along the way you see the Shepherd in the East knows like this in Psalms 23 knows how the Dew Falls what side of the mountain it falls on even in the season and when that Dew will fall upon that it knows what certain plants will come out within that time and it knows how to lead those sheep it also knows the the kinds of things that the Sheep do not need to partake of they have to watch out for certain plants that are there you know Paul said don't do not get entangled in YouTube I mean in Endless genealogies don't get entangled in things like that cuz it ain't going to benefit you you know why good would it to you to do today after you get out of church and you're hungry and you go feed in a garbage can why would you want to do that I just want to stay and feed in the things of God oh brother Samuel I want to know the points I want to I don't want to argue the word was not meant to debate the word was meant to Beed as a matter of fact the prophet tells us there in the church ages he said the reason that the word did not have the effect that it should in the days of Luther he said is because men studied it for mere learning and did not give thems to the word that it might have a practical outworking in their lives I don't want to do that I want this word to be made flesh so all along the way God help us to know as the do where is the D falling because the do remember God never promised Jacob the firstborn was never promised big massive Reigns but part of the Covenant was you'll have the do from Heaven Hallelujah I appreciate rigns don't you but you get very hard r it'll just be run off but real Dew will settle in to the ground real Dew will settle in and take away you can take a plant it could be a hard rain man that plant needs water but if it's a hard rain if that ground is not in condition to receive that rain when it comes it'll run right off and that plant you know what that plant begins to do this is why they tell you when you buy plants water them deep and the way you water them deep is with slow dripping water and it causes the roots to go down down down to seek that water if you just water a tree or a shrub and you just simply and watered in like that it causes the roots to just stay on the surface because it knows there's a lot of water on the surface then when it comes hard times when it's time to draw oh my when the hot times comes it's just used where where's that surface water at but when it is guided notice what the water is to do not only is the water to provide nourishment but it's to lead the roots to the Unseen source of water that's beneath it oh don't you thank God for that so as a Shepherd a Shepherd is there to and under the leading of the Holy Spirit he's there to watch out for many things to serving the body to watch out for enemies and watch out and defend the sheep from attackers and heal the wounded and sick and M you know when you get to studying on Like a Shepherd remember David carried a little grip bag and as he would carry that if they one got sick he'd put that honey on the Rock and knowing what was in that rock is what they needed but remember a sheep ain't just going to go over and lick on a rock you got to sweeten it up a little bit and God knows exactly how to sweeten things up oh sometimes there's things that's just so hard and cutting but God knows how to sweeten it by his presence that we might lick on that and gather the nutrients minerals that we have need of in our life and all of that that has to be mindful of as well now when I think of this this character that Boaz has seen within her he's reached her the parched corn I I want you to notice on that scripture if we could just read that scripture one more time it says in verse 14 of Ruth 2 Boaz said unto her at meal time this is more grace being extended at Meal Time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers now how's she going to know when it's Meal Time Well evidently there would be something it would notify her at meal time now notice bohas never told her I'm going to come get you at Meal Time matter of fact I'm going to send out an escort you don't have to walk that way uh you don't have to walk up to the house of where it's at I'm going to make everything no he could have done that but you see if he had done that it would not have further released the character that he already saw that was there you see remember Paul saw the faith in Abraham but James said the people will see your faith by the works that's expressed on the inside oh my so whatever notice he he could have done that for Ruth but he didn't do it remember this is all part of her there will be many other tests as we'll look at in coming Services there are tests that are throughout this entirety of this chapter of where she is tested and all of these Temptations and things that are around her but remember God is Not Afraid afid to allow his children to be tested God ain't afraid of it no sir he's not afraid to let testing comes even according to the measure that we're able to withstand in this hour and even in that we don't feel like we can withstand what God brings on us but God's Got Confidence in where the word is working in our life currently that's good is that right now notice this Boaz reaches her parched corn now notice as it comes in it says right here in the scripture she sat down beside the Reapers she did not walk in there and say hey hey hey y'all just sit back over here and I'm just going to come right down watch such humility she sits down beside the Reapers notice this is receiving of real Grace it's humility that's what coming to the house of God should be it should be reverence respect humility remember when Isaiah came in the temple he saw this it brought him into these places to do what respect the word of God CU we really can't have respect for one another unless we respect God right we can't have that reverence we can't have that worship we can't have that humility in the right way it all stems from that walk with God now her humility of setting down beside the reacher the the Reapers and how he would reach her parch corn not like what you and I maybe you know when you read the scripture sometimes you might just think well it's just corn that's been roasted this is barley season it's resurrection power and what is has taken place this grain that Boaz himself planted has come to full maturity this grain itself has already been waved you know there's already been a wave sheath went over and that grain itself is grain that's come out of that field now with that grain that's come out of that field he didn't just serve her raw grain nor was it just grain that had been blanched but it was grain that had went through that of harvest been gleaned been shooked out and then it had actually been you know beat out and brought into a cake with some aromatic herbs that would then be presented to her in a in a way and you know what it was it was to let her know there is more for width of this where this is coming from remember she was not doing this on her own accord she did not have the ability she was not in that position but her at that time she was in a position to Simply receive what Boaz was providing oh God may we ever stay in that kind of a position may we never get to a place that we're telling our Boaz you do this and I need this because if we do that sure is the world we cannot be the Bride of Jesus Christ and telling our husband what to do and what not to do that's what God Esther put away is that right now notice this in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 13 Paul would write of this you know in admonishing the Thessalonians he would say uh for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when when you received the word of God which you heard of us now notice when you received the word of God which you heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that belief now notice taking taking that word you know I want to be a feeder God has not called me here this morning or he's not called you either to be a sorter you ever seen people that you know sometimes you ever watch them little videos where they're sorting the fish out and they you know this fish and that's bad you know they're sorting them out sorting them out sorting them out get rid of this one get rid of that one let that one pass let this God ain't called us to be sorters do we need discernment we do need discernment cuz I'll tell you I've never preached a perfect sermon in my life there is elements of man that's in there but God has not called you nor me nor anybody else to sit here and be a sorter you can sort all day long and it's just on your own accord and not be a feeder when I leave out of here I want sustenance within my soul I want to know that I've been in the presence of God and there is word but not just I've had a snack or an AER I want to feed on the things of almighty God I am purposed and intending and believing that God is going to speak to my needs oh God help us to receive that word to effectually work in our lives cuz that word has power within it it don't stop it don't stop when you receive the word as that word comes into your life it's like brother bam talking about those who was taking that uh uh I can't remember the name of that metal now he speaks up and spoken words Original Seed that that that one that's really toxic I don't know if it's uranium I can't remember what it was and they were you know putting it on that that you know on those watch hands before and they were you know they would lick that brush and dip it down there cuz you got to get the brush real fine and when they did that they found out all of these people that worked in that plan they died and when they died they died from that poisoning of that metal they were painting on those watch hands he said and they found out after those people died he said that steel when they would take one of their skulls take the bones they would find that ticking going off from that metal oh he said how the word of God that has been spoken and circled and circled the Earth it will move down into hearts and that same word that we receive oh God it has life within it there's a womb a ground that can receive that word it will produce just exactly what God Said now what's this effect Brethren you became followers of the churches of God which are in Judea that are in Christ Jesus now not just churches but churches that that local locality but that are in Christ Jesus they're walking in present truth it's it's the word that God has revealed in this hour because you see if I were to preach any other message it won't take effect on you if you're real bride seed it won't take effect on you but let me just go ahead and say this even if there's lives that are not bride seed that will set here all the way through the Rapture if you will determine in your heart I do not want to go to hell I want to serve God I want to reverence his word the whole time now you don't know whether you are or not but I'll tell you one thing I you don't have to go to hell if you don't want to God don't send nobody to hell is that right like God told Kain Kain you'll not be any different but if you'll do what you see and know to be the truth I will accept you but notice this is why the prophet would talk about even over and over I I've got these quotes but I I don't want to read them I I just want to refer to him and he would speak of how when when when trophies would come to the Altar and he would Min mention you know to the people find a good church home he said find a good church home and be baptized in Christian baptism and receive the Holy Ghost and live a Godly life thereafter he would say find a good Holy Ghost filled church and go to it and seek his baptism now watch this don't just go to church but seek his baptism until you found it go every day every night just keep praying why I want to know him fully so when we we're talking about this of even going to church I don't want you to think of it and look at it when you see here feeding and fell oh that that's just going to church no that that's not the correct way to look at that when we're talking about going to church reading quotes about being in the house of God there's a reason there is a feeding that is to take place where God the chief Shepherd will lead us into the places that we need to be feeding and it doesn't even stop when the preacher stops that's right Hallelujah you with me Hallelujah we need him friends remember Jude said there were some who were feeding themselves without fear in other words they were their own Shepherds they didn't need they didn't I don't need that they were their own Shepherds then we had those in the book of Corinthians that had their preferences well I like paulus I like Peter AR sephus I like this and then there were those who were just I'm of Christ I'm better than all of y'all I'm of Christ you see such the carnality that can get in there to recognize it's not man it's not man this is why friends I I I'll tell you I I I long for the day I I think we should be there but I realize we've got a way to go I long for the day to where personalities are no longer worshiped Hall I long for the day when it's no longer for this man and putting this up and putting that and people flocking in and flocking for this listen friends we ought to be coming for the right thing but let me say this to you you can meet God one onone in your own life in your own prayer closet yes sir yes sir hallu yes sir oh God help us because it's not man it's God who works through the office of a man now watch are his gifts that he has there remember God's desire even as he would say within this look in 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 1 where even when the writing of the new newborns where Paul would or Peter would write lay us IDE all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings and as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby and if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious so God gives us strength this milk that we're talking of we all have had our time of starting with milk is that right right and depending on sometimes how that we will go about things God may have to say we need to go go back and visit some milk right now sometimes God has to do that but you see God knows what plants that we have need of he knows the nutrients that we have need of in our lives and God also knows that we are and mindful that we are but flesh now within that there's a desire we need the milk of the word notice the desire that God has for our life is that we would grow think of how the prophet would stand there in the message taking sides with Jesus preaching to a group of Brethren and he's speaking to them there at home and he would speak and express his heart's desire oh how I wish that I had Outpost over there in India Africa those places he said when multitudes have come to the Lord I wish I had somewhere to send them to he said instead he said many of them he said never go on at all with God in any way he said they have old dead formal churches they have nothing that can cultivate and further than walk along with God my that was the prophet's burden that there would be Outpost places where the Sheep of God decisions he said decisions when a man has accepted Christ then by the sword of the word cut them into Sons and Daughters of God like in Michaelangelo took and removed everything that was not Moses oh God what a what a word now notice this in Hebrews 10 these are this is familiar scriptures to us in Hebrews chapter 10 notice how Paul would write this let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let us watch how he writes this consider that means being thoughtful of attentive to one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works my the next verse we're familiar with this not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching now Paul was not saying exhorting one another hey you need to be in the house of God hey no the exhorting is as we come together Paul knowing that in this walk we get discouraged there might be one that's disc courage one that might feel lower than this carpet but as they come and say God despite my discouragement I'm going to come and notice how do we meet Jesus we meet him in one another we meet him and one another remember when Paul was on the road there to Damascus and he says and here the light smites him down he said who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest what was it the Corporal body had already ascended sent back the Holy Ghost and it was Jesus meeting in a body of Believers that's why the prophet could say in why Christ speak 1963 he said Jesus goes to church Jesus he said goes to church every day he goes to church in his people and worships woo my Hallelujah why you are the real house of prayer you are a place of communion where the master can come and lay his head and disclose his desires and he's not laughed at he's not ridiculed he's not said ah we don't need that but he's embraced he's welcomed not forsaking which means to abandon leaving Straits leave helpless just to totally abandon now notice within this part of it this is why when the prophet would tell us over and over in places in the message I I referred to a few of them one of the other plac he said he says if you don't have a church you must because if you don't you'll die spiritually you'll dwindle away you know what he's talking about listen to me now listen I'm talking about if you can apply this correctly it's not it's not just to have a church home to say what I'm associated with but it's a place of feeding it's a place where you can hear the chief Shepherd speaking to you where he's leading you he's ministering to you he's speaking lip to ear to you he knows you he knows your life Jesus said I know my sheep by name he knows our character he knows all about us he don't try to change us he don't try to make Paul like Zachary Zachary like Aaron Aaron God don't want that God don't want he he wanted that he'd created it that way God don't run a serious and hard robu Harmony House are you with me I don't want to have to quote quote a bunch of quotes but I'm pulling from quotes when I'm saying that God don't God's not interested in your temperament being like my temperament God's not in that's not the change the change that God comes to do is the change on the inside and then he equips that life on the inside with Divine love that's able to submit itself and its character be molded to match the word hallelujah but just you see this is why many times I I think of it every time I encourage with young people places depending on you know sometimes I've been there and and ministered within a closing service maybe a Clos closing night service or it's been the closing morning service and I I move with some instruction and Direction and a lot of times the brothers will follow that evening with some of that and one of the things that's mentioned within there is to realize as like you remember brother bam called it he said many times people just get Campground crank camps cramps that everything on the campground but once the campground's over with hey I love those atmospheres those are important those are necessary those are needful but God never intended for you and I to live under camp meeting atmosphere all the time that's right I can't preach that to you today but but you see you say brother Samuel you talking about we're not to have joy who yes we are to have joy friends listen I have just as much joy when I'm in a meeting when I've been in a meeting or when I'm walking down and I'm cutting my hydrus back I got joy because you want to know why your roots should not be just shallow am waiting for the next Revival oh I've got to wait for the next meeting no it's get into Christ and let your roots go so deep that no matter how dry it is around you you found a hidden Source whose leaves do not wither blessed is that man hallu but you see it's just this is why the instruction would come feed your experience because I don't know no other minister knows or so and so this no they we encourage everyone no matter where you're Brad feed your experience that God has given you well brother the time you maybe it hasn't went all the way down well Feed The Experience God has touched you made you aware of and maybe you were going a million miles the other way and God turned you right around and made you aware I ain't lost sight of you you are mine I'm talking about right in here that God would deal with that don't just walk out of the service and say glory to God God hadn't forgotten about me feed that experience don't neglect to feed my Lord have mercy now watch this watch this quote out of thirsting for Life brother BR says you watch this deer I I want to read this one to you he said it gets out to itself and away from the herd and that's the one the wolf works on now watch the Sheep gets out to itself it wasn't LED that way right it wasn't LED that way but it gets off on its own you know sometimes before a sheep ever gets off on its own it's still Gathering right here but it's already gathering on its own right in here because remember it it really ain't about it's not about this this is simply something you've got to bring in obedience this is something that simply at times brother Samuel there times that you don't feel like coming to church are you kidding me there's times I don't feel like preaching there's times I don't feel like studying I don't feel feel like praying sometimes I don't feel like dealing with problems I don't feel like it but you know what when I when I don't feel like it in that I'm not going to let this flesh I'm not putting me up listen to me I'm letting you know the man that's preaching to you goes through battles that's right that's right and any man that tells you he doesn't he's a liar that's right you go through battles before you can ever listen there's things now I can go right through and listen to the message of the hour and I can tell you brother Brams went through this went through this went through this went through this and he's not even saying it but I know it because it's experiences it isn't just getting up and quoting a bunch of scriptures and a bunch of quotes it's experiences oh my when he preaches grest battle ever fought he's not just preaching something and just looking at it he is preaching to you and I experiences that he's went through when he talks about Abraham an old spooky Spirit getting around him but Abraham would take the sword and cut that thing cut that thing cut that thing cut that thing he said he would poke a little hole then he said the hole get bigger brother brandom is preaching by experience sir you know what that is that's the chief Shepherd that has allowed an UND sheeper Hallelujah to come and experience the pathway that you and I can look at this pathway and say thank you Lord I know I'm odd but I'm not that odd I'm still I am redeemed of the Lord these feelings that I have that's not who I am but I thank God for the word that's come that I can feed upon huh oh he says but that old man he says notice that W that wolf will work on you and you old man or woman when you separate yourself from Believers now notice when you separate your self from Believers not Believers separating from you when you like brother Andrew said just buckle up your seat belts a minute this is for our good friends but I want you to I this is what I want you to hear the words this is where I want you to hear the words feed my sheep feed my Lambs feed the flock it's about feeding when we're coming to the house of God there's two parts to it feeding and fellowship amen I'm just coming to feet no you're missing another key part don't forsake to assemble yourselves together remember God wasn't going to send down a taxi Uber lft whatever those things are he wasn't going to send one of those autonomous vehicles down hey Ruth don't worry don't worry don't worry you don't have to sacrifice there's no pressure you don't have to hey I I I I'll make it easy right no at Meal Time come see she's got to show she had it's a demonstrating it's not her well I got to do this noce he's he's drawing he's allowing that character to come out and even when now she gets into his presence she'll sit down humbly beside the Reapers and he reaches parch corn you know God won't get us out of bed on Sunday mornings God don't come around and smack our feet and say hey hey hey hey come on it's time to assemble that's right God won't do you know there's things in his word that God will not do for you and I he'll open the Red Sea cuz you can't do that right right God God entrusts things to you and I to do even in your giving and thing God don't do that God trust you and I notice where Paul wrote Don't forsake yourselves right assembling together lot of different reasons and factors within that can I have just a few more moments he says people can say I can stay at home and be just as good a Christian as I can at church you can't I want you to notice there's key there's key words in there I I I can now I know probably in this quote right here we'd like to have the hyphenated version and have it in small print maybe marginal print but streaming streaming has its part and listen there's different ones that even stream here but if they've got a local assembly a place that they can assemble together I I'd encourage them you've got a place to go and to [Music] feed and the second part that is just as important and goes along with it Fellowship many times we we get the feeding or sometimes the feeding and we think we got the feeding down but remember when you really feed on something it changes you it changes you when you feed on it that's how even when a sheep is they're eating it'll change them as they feed on those different grasses and different botney life throughout brother the Bram quotes that scripture not forsake ourselves assembling ourselves together that much more as we see the time coming sometimes we just simply have to tell our flesh like you heard the prophet tell tell his flesh when his flesh said just call Brother Neville tell brother Neville you're not even going to be there brother Bram said I told my flesh shut up you're not my boss I'm your boss come on friends even when we come here and sit in the house of God oh my oh you know sometimes it's a sacrifice to praise it's it's easy to worship and praise when everything is going just right if you're a Christian now watch just just friends take this and listen to this if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians not just go and see but Fellowship amen you see listen thank God for the feeding of the word but if you miss Fellowship you miss a part that God has called you to yeah to think beyond your own self that is so good oh I want to be like Jesus I want to be more like him and the prophet could say in images of Christ he said I want more of the Holy Ghost to take over more of William Bren amen he say a matter of fact he said I want another baptism of the Holy Ghost why brother brandom he said so I can be more of a servant like he was Sir so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life now there's there there's a lot to this here you can't do it because it's like I'm hungry I'll never go to a table I I I'll never eat I just ain't going to do it you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship with one another notice how he puts the two together feed and fellowship let us consider one another but the same I do my wife my family no one another even going beyond our families going Beyond I know sometimes it's family sometimes this is the first time of the week with church time comes it's first time we get to see family I realize even with schedules and things going on I I realize that but listen friends it's just like this when we have meetings coming on we have new ones coming in Oh Brother Samuel I'll tell you so you know there's such a sweetness and such listen listen Even in our lives we want to be accommodating to others let me tell you when you if you go other places say oh they're so sweet how do you think they got that way you think the preacher back that in in his briefcase no that don't happen that way that comes from fervent dedication in hearts and lives to create an atmosphere there's been testimony after testimony different ones that's come right in here I pray to God I pray to God I I realize if they they realize if they could stay around long enough they'd realize we're not the Utopia we're just like any other Church we've got problems we've got ups and downs are you with me if they just said they stay around long enough but I don't say any of that because you know what we are every Church does we need one another but we're growing onto the Rapture we're not ignorant that oh my this is the Utopia but it requires us us how many of you like to walk into a reservice and you sense the atmosphere amen you just you just love that well let me just tell you something those atmosphere and those things you might be benefiting sometimes and I thank God so because sometimes there might be times when you're down and you walk in here thank God there's other saints of God when you or I have been discouraged that they have come together to create an atmosphere that we can move into and the pressures of Life can just man W it's nice to sit down here and thank you Lord Jesus and all of a sudden here we are sitting beside Reapers and about that time here Boaz reaches us some parch corn and and we're like Elijah we're just about tuckered out and and there's a good whole cake that comes our way made of some resurrection power and we get a hold of that we little something starts moving a little bit in us and and pretty soon you know there's something that starts moving there on the inside and and you know where at one time we just felt like that Gloom is something just starts moving there on the inside and the prophet said after a while he said I watch how a point is made and then I watch Tears stream down those eyes I watch a smile break across that face he said you know what that is that's the holy spirit in you feeding on the word of God hallelujah it's that part on you that you are giving the right away hallelujah it's saying I'm going to feed Hallelujah I'm going to feed I'm going to pull on the word of God we all have needs but as we're here right now and pulling on the gift of God listen friends it is a body Ministry we are here to fellowship with one another we're here to draw strength from elhi down into our lives that will literally change our lives one of these days will be the final moment of feeding and we will step from this Dimension into that Dimension and guess guess what when we get over there we'll still be feeding and fellowshipping you're Lov [Applause] him the prophet said he'll continue to unfold and reveal through the endless ages and we'll be fellowshipping hey brother I made it we'll be saying that at the Met wedding supper then maybe we'll get out there in the front yard of our Mansion maybe we'll be walking up and down the streets you go cuz there won't be nobody there to criticize us there we'll just begin to think of the goodness of God that he's brought us this far my Lord it was not my my it was not me and myself it was God's grace and God gave me Grace to recognize his grace thank you Lord for the strength to press through every battle thank you Lord when I needed a good oldfashioned barley cake Lord you reach me some barley cake Lord to strengthen me in my journey Hall amen hallelujah love him let's just stop there this morning what will we'll pick it up but I trust here this morning that even just as we take a little glimpse of this and would look at it quotes that I could refer to and read to I don't want you to look at these quotes or these things that we've ministered this morning on just going to church or about oh letting the enemy shame you listen when God comes with his word he don't shame you he'll correct you right this is why the prophet could say miss a day's work he said you all right there he said but don't miss church he said because your day's work is your daily bread and God promised he'd provide that if you put him first now there's always there there's always a part we understand you just don't call up your boss today and say hey no more buddy don't do that that's that that's not the wisdom behind that quote it a like glory to God man and I can quit my job that's not how it's application when what the prophet is talking about in these points and if God will give us Grace sometimes we as his children being the sheep that we are can get entangled and God helps us to see our entanglements and sometimes how that hinders us but I'm grateful that he comes down and he will find his sheep there's nothing as pitiful sometimes you hear a sheep maybe it's went off on its own and it gets into what they call these little mud bogs you don't realize what it is it's just standing around and all of a sudden it starts sinking I've watched I've seen videos where horses this has happened to horses it's happened to sheep but a sheep will just well that's called a distress call as well and when there's distress calls predators are always there somebody just gets a little offended they get a little offended or they get often oh there's a distress call that starts going out isn't it amazing I I've always been amazed at this how that offended and offenses seem to somehow join leagues I've always have been amazed at that as a Shepherd I've watched it I've watched things I've watched things to even when I've stood right here and the spirit of God would reveal things to me and I would meet with an individual later on and say you was fellowshipping with this person and this person was running down your confidence in the ministry I didn't make that happen that was for the benefit of that brother that was for the benefit of that brother to help him to see I've always been amazed at that but I've also always been amazed at hearts and lives just want to be so in tune with God it'll yoke together as well that's birds of a feather flock together yes Sirah I'll tell you what sheep want to be where sheep food's at that's right I want to be where sheep food's at I want to be with somebody it don't matter they don't have to be older than me I sat around with these these brothers here the other night we had Fellowship the young sisters had their had their little meeting and we had fellowship and we fellowshipped about the things of God I I wanted to hear what was on their hearts we wanted to fellowship and talk about these things I'll tell you what there's things that has that can be expressed all of a sudden it just things just start sparking on the inside and I love to see God working in Hearts I just oh those are the things to me I don't need caffeine then I don't need caffeine you just let me hear and see how God's working in people's lives and it's like it's like a joke for me right there oh my there's things that God oh my we don't you love him we're here let me just let me just stop it right here we're here to feed and to Fellowship now friends listen I'm going to tell you I'm not smart enough to know where to take you you I know who I've met and I know what he's called me to do do I feel in myself with that ability no no as a matter of fact if God carries it' be 22 years that I've been pastoring I feel less than I did when I first started the responsibility and the burden is so much greater and I'm not just telling you that but I say it from My Heart Lord I don't I don't have just Time moments I don't want to take people's time never have but I realize every moment God help me that your sheep as I stand and feed in your place help me Lord lead me to the to the slopes where the Dew has fallen lead us Lord to those places because you see what happens after the service is over your feeding doesn't stop right your Victory doesn't stop when brother you're not in the presence of brother Samuel you're in the presence of your Chief Shepherd he's the bishop and Shepherd of your soul and your feeding goes on and on and on and on through the week sometimes he might have us feeding in a certain area on a certain Hillside there on overcoming worry he might have us feeding on another Hillside studying Ruth he knows exactly what he's doing I just Lord you know the nutrients I need right now I want to eat I I want to feed on the word of God not just hear it I want to take it in and feed on it don't you love him amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you Lord for your word thank you for the encouragement thank you Father for the admonition even where Ruth is at in her journey it never stops it never ceases as a matter of fact Lord God as it goes and it grows and it grows I just Lord reading of how your Prophet said it used to bother you to sit in church for 10 minutes he said and listen to the preaching he said but after you got the Holy Ghost he said it don't bother you a bit you just feed he said because something in you that's feeding now Lord I know my flesh gets tired sometimes i' I've been there I've been there Lord where I've sat there and I realize for the people sitting in front of me those that I minister to here no matter where I've been Lord father there's only so much that our flesh even though we're lifted in Heavenly places but there's only so much Lord that our flesh can endure oh our heart oh M I feel like David I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord father may we lord as your children as we've taking a look here in the scriptures this with Ruth help us Lord as we look at these things on feeding and fellowship help us Lord I pray how that Lord that Satan would like to just get us off to ourselves and our own little ideas and our own little things he'd like to separate because that's when the wolf can get after us that's when things can get after us Lord I pray this morning if there's one that may be sitting here in their heart this morning that's strayed from the way of the Lord maybe Lord they look in their life and say I don't know if there's any way back for me Father you're the chief Shepherd Lord I could lay my hands on them I could speak to them but I can never touch them or speak to them in a way like you can now Lord I'm asking you Lord God that you would touch that Heart Lord maybe they've grown a little cold maybe indifferent Lord maybe they've got off Lord in to themselves maybe they've become entangled with the Affairs of life unbeknown Lord like Paul would write of a trap and the reason that that would be there is because Satan knows he knows and understands the value of the people of God coming and feeding and fellowshipping because Lord I'm not only thankful for the feeding I'm so glad for the fellowship of my brothers and sisters I love Lord to be able to stand out here and Shake one another's hand I love to be able to greet one another Lord I love Lord to be able to hear and to talk with your children Lord my brothers and sisters I love that Lord you know my heart I've told them many times but you know my heart I stand before you that's one of the things that I look forward to Lord in the week is being able to see them Lord is praying for him as I walk up and down when I'm here of a day I come right in here and I'll pray I'll walk through this Sanctuary I'll lay hands on these pews times I'll go and set in certain seats and pray oh God because Lord You're the chief Shepherd we need one another I need my brother I need my sister I need Christ in them Lord God help us Lord help us Lord that we can even every one of us Lord to see that Parton that reality those two parts are feeding and fellowship help us father we need you Lord and we need you in one another Lord help us Lord I pray anybody like to raise their hand with me say Lord help help me help me Lord I want to feed Lord I want to Fellowship help me to look Beyond Myself like you called Peter to look Beyond hisself help me Lord even with the cares of this life oh I know the cares of this life are are heavy they didn't getting easier things are getting are getting more difficult hours things are more taxing I know that he knows that too but let's just say Lord help me to see help me Lord to do help me to sacrifice I want to look to you help me father because as I feed on the word then I've got something in my life I've I've got I've got an atmosphere of strength in my life that's able to go and encourage my brother encourage my sister encourage my family encourage a loved one maybe encourage my Baptist friend that's on the job maybe they'll not not even be maybe they'll not ever ever see what I would see but let me encourage them to walk in the light that they can see granted Lord help us father Lord you see our hands you see our hearts as your children as your sheep we're the Sheep of your pasture and Lord would you help us in a special way forgive us Lord when we've allowed other things to come in forgive us Lord when we've got lazy or sluggish we're sheep Lord we need to be led sometimes Lord as you lead us on the things that we need to be led in hillsides we need to feed thank you Father I want to say thank you Lord as a sheep of yours Lord I'm thankful for this Lord may we feed Lord I don't want to just come and listen to the word of God I want to feed on it help us Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ don't you love him oh my how we need we need him amen how we love him Hallelujah could we sing that song coming dine

hallelujah we're not just coming off the ground to touch back down but there is a fuel or a power Hallelujah that can put you in orbit that can cause you to look down on the thing that looks so great
