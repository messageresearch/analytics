amen how many is happy to be in the house of the lord amen it's so good to be together together once again amen and we certainly uh are just thankful for what the lord has done amen in our midst amen here this past weekend that was just a just a real glorious time and um you know god knows just exactly what you and i have need of for the journey it's just like in this service this morning god knows what our needs are and those times as i mentioned to you on thursday and i had spoke about it before very they're very special times it's always it's it's always precious to be able to come together as saints of god and you see other brothers and sisters coming and and i i just believe when we are coming together like that there are needs that are very special needs and god is present to meet those needs amen that's why when we we always will pray for the sick we believe in that that we're always in line in an order amen with laying hands on the sick we're always in line in order with baptizing and all those things but i just believe with all my heart that it's a it's a time where there's needs in meetings like that and how god will come and minister in a special way i know there's i know there's other testimonies and i want you just to think of it in this way what brother benny said is very very very true you would hear brother branham say it over and over he said you'll find out he said as you pastors that after we've left they'll be testimonies continue to come in amen because whatever god has spoken you hold on to that but god has spoken to your heart and it will it will come to pass amen i want to say i just so thankful just as seeing each and every one just coming together last weekend you know and uh for the services and i want to say i appreciate brother aaron sister amanda for taking on that with i know they got a little nervous when i had announced on saturday night but i had already some time ago already had spoke to uh brother randy and um with the congregation there they had the same itinerary that i gave to you and so i i just think that was a wonderful time i didn't know it but brother randy was talking to me about it he was so pulled and he was actually at the gonna they were actually looking at just coming here on sunday cancelling their service and just coming here but had a few people some that streamed that just felt you know kind of committed to so we didn't all that wasn't arranged because they could have streamed the service from here but it was so good to be together wasn't it amen just a wonderful time in in fellowship and i i tell you what i'll say this you know i forgot about this i've gotta i have to say this i don't know if any of you have heard it or not but you know on sunday sunday evening i i heard benjamin talking to my wife and uh of course my mind i was so tired i really didn't pay too much attention i didn't hear about it till the next morning but i heard him talking to her and he said mom this is what he started was saying he said i'm looking he said at that rice he says as that rice was being served he said and the rice he said it wasn't going down now i'm not talking about the first two first two trades there were four trays right i'm gonna talk about the first two trays now my wife did not communicate to sister amanda about that sister amanda then on monday morning or tuesday morning one of those mornings monday she says something to my wife about it i was standing there with brother brian maybe we weren't observing those things but we were we were had our eyes on the hot sauce making sure it was but i do remember when when i went through the line you remember you went right ahead of me it was as though that they put those other two trays in this tray over here it's as though there was not even a dent put in that tray he said brother samuel you're trying to make something no i'm not trying to make something out of it there's others that mentioned it as well i tell you what i told the boys on saturday on sunday morning on the way over to the place i said boys i said i said i'm being very very serious they said we may have to pray ask god to multiply the food it's because i don't know all that'll be here and i'll tell you what he's still god he's still god i mean what what what is it to testimonies you know sister patsy for god to raise a coffee stem out of a drain right what is it to god when when your oven wouldn't bake a cake and you and sister rita laid hands on it and baited bake the cake for the believers to come over because when they first come to the lord just simple the simple faith i tell you i i just to me i was just i said thank you lord i was just so thankful god knows god knows what our need is so and i know uh brother willie and sister mercy were there i think at about 12 and uh helping to really set up and there's just no way that this the meeting and things could have went on without all the efforts that are that are apart and go into it and most importantly we just thank you for being here because when we have a meeting like this anytime anytime i feel on my heart with having a meeting i don't have a meeting just to have a meeting i don't even have brothers to come in just to say well i'm gonna have a brother come in but it's where i fill it up on my heart and it's not it's not just for me it's for all of us and we just we just really want to get in there and i just so appreciate each of you just amen just just being here and just really pitching in the other part is is really making the saints of god just feel welcome i mentioned this to the church on thursday over and over the brothers and sisters from south carolina the things that they themselves continue to mention was just the love that they felt from the people and they just continued to say it over and over perhaps i'm sure they probably said it to many of you and just the liberty and the atmosphere to be able to minister the word of the lord and perfect people no we're not perfect people by far none of us are perfect but if there's one thing brother branham would say it like this he said if i could have one he said one request he said i would rather have this congregation he's speaking of branham tabernacle he says i would rather have it be known for the love of god then we have all the gifts because i can tell you the love of god will work it works it's the holy spirit the love of god would reach out into a heart and a life that might be struggling the love of god will reach out into that life and encourage it you know the church itself we we you know children come to birth and we we have we we carry children right and as children are to come to birth what do you do you supply the different needs what's needed right you see different ones you see needs and needs to need to encourage here need to encourage there just like the sister or our lady here they begin to you know eat certain things craving certain things they're doing that for that life that is within them that's the same thing as a body of believers that even as the word is coming and then even as as we're looking on to be able to minister to one another so i i just i tell you i thank god for that amen and may it always be that way may it always be that way that's as our desire [Music] i also want to just hear this morning musicians i won't keep you here i'll let you be seated i also before i ask you to stand for the reading of the word before that i'd like um sister gomez and sister naomi and sister maria my wife if you would stand this is purposely to embarrass you sister maria i want to i want to say i want to thank these sisters because they they took on the the sunday school and um they throughout all the all the years and everything from it was shortly after 2006 and uh until that time of when when covet had come in in 2020 and their their dedication and labor uh to the work because you know there's a lot that goes into that you know of with with that of sunday school it's not just you know there might be a little kids that were teaching in different ages but there's a lot of there's preparation that goes into that you know we don't want to they can we don't want them when they show up there they have a worksheet or you know just play a video or just do something like that no we want we want some things to be or some instructions some things to be mentioned there and so these sisters have from that time and and we just i want to say from the behalf of the whole congregation and some of them are going to be alternating in here um but i want to just say i really and as a congregation could we just give them a man a hand clap for everything amen god bless you thank you sisters and lord willing next sunday we'll be starting the sunday school and um sister lily derekot will be be taking that on it might just be a couple and they're very small very young children but um it's a start and so we just want we'll just see how the lord will just go from there and we just i just want to say um we are so grateful for the grace of god and that burden that the lord has placed a man upon different hearts and and so i don't think there's any other announcement that i have to do and i know this time always gets counted against me that's why i almost want somebody else to do announcements as soon as i step up here time starts going so if we could just if we just stand and we want to go before the lord once again and i know we're here you have needs and i have need each and every one of us certainly have a have a need from god we just want to invite him to come you know i have i have things that are right here before me that's been on my heart and just that god has inspired but we need him to come and inspire all of us we want him to come and speak to us i'm not interested never have been that i have to go according to all my notes because if you if sometimes if you've seen how many pages of notes that i have you would probably faint i i find myself doing more of that sometimes now because sometimes i don't all together i like to be able to read over the thought of where i'm going so don't faint you you might think some other times like oh brother samuel you must be preaching that 20 some 30 some 40 some pages of no no no usually it's only about five but i have to but all those things so if you've seen it all oh my [Laughter] you'd probably ask for different chairs in here but but god knows what we have need of and i'm just would you pray with me god will just come and just help us to get out of the way that he can convey the thought and that he's the one that'll be right here present he's here he's here right now we've come with that expectation and we just want to invite him just to take complete control this morning amen would you pray with me heavenly father lord we thank you for your mercy once again lord thank you for the opportunity that we have to be able to come and together lord together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith lord we we lord esteem and we just long for these moments lord to be able to come together and to hear from you father lord we ask that you'll just just take control lord of speaker and hearer together the things lord that you lord placed on my heart lord there's a there's a thought behind it oh god i pray that you just help me just to step out of the way and be ever so sensitive lord that if there's a lord just whatever that need is lord if it needs be lord to go off lord on a side road lord we're here to follow you lord it's lord our desire that you will come and minister to every need among us lord and father for those that are in need of healing in their body that you'll just minister to them lord those in the visible and invisible audience o god those in need of the holy ghost lord that you'll just move lord among us lord and may they receive oh god that experience this morning lord that reality that oh god it changes their life lord from time to eternity oh god may you just lord take your word and speak to our hearts we need to hear from you lord we love you and we thank you lord and ask that you would forgive us if there's anything that we have said or done or thought lord we are our people o god that are in need lord of the blood of jesus christ and we thank you o god lord that we have an advocate one who stands on our behalf lord and lord we ask that you'll just come lord have your way in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen in mark chapter 5 i'm just going to read three verses of scripture verse 21 if we could and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue gyrus by name when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd like just to continue that thought this morning we were looking a few sundays ago on the pursuit of your need you know what we read here with jairus there's much resolve in a decision anytime a person is to make a decision we should never make a decision too lightly the lord jesus even said what man goeth to war and doesn't first set down and consider all the cost or goes to build something and first does not consider all the cost what the lord jesus is speaking there he's dealing with it there's a decision and that decision is a decision that's made by faith because faith is not a short-range faith is a long-range vision faith doesn't see all the obstacles faith just knows this is the goal right here because there's a lot of obstacles there's a lot within that of the journey and you know the need arose jairus was a secret believer remember brother branham would preach that message uh regarding jairus matter of fact he would preach it many times the raising and healing of jairus's daughter the secret believer jairus and then brother branham would take and he would speak also once again under inspiration but he would tie it in prophetically and deal with jairus's daughter as a maid as one who was predestinated to life she was 12 years of age she had come to the age of accountability she was laying dead and brother brandon will take that and type that into we were dead and it had to be the lord jesus had to come and to raise us to life and this is this is reality you know you can you or i can walk in this life and you feel like i have life but david david caught caught inspiration that there is a life that's higher than this life i mean think of it this life alone holds so many disappointments and sickness and everything else but there is a greater life a life that is beyond just of this life that's here and this is why david could say thy loving kindness is better than life it's something that is more than just the things of of this earth and of this season and this and you see many times this is where uh a person can become very uh settled and just with this life and being a part of this and being a part of a church or being and they just become settled with this life but in reality it's not being a part of a church that should be your aim of your goal but our aim and our goals should be i want to be part of jesus christ i want my life to be the display of what is written in here just like a packet of seeds that has all that writing on it and it tells you uh where it will start the germination and all the process and what it will be in its maturity and you flip on the front of the seed package and you see the plant in its maturity where it has reproduced what it really is that's what that's what we desire as a people of god we just don't want to be as we're kind of looking at that on thursday night just associated around we want to be united with jesus christ that's why that's why we've that's why we've come here and being united with jesus christ then it becomes the desire within our life so overwhelmingly then all i want to do is please him all i want to do is live for him and the the the goal of our life and the desire is the coming of the lord because you are longing for the very one that you're united with spiritually in your life i mean what young lady or what young man does not look forward to that that time of the marriage ceremony if they're not really looking forward to it then something's wrong on the vowel that was made but the vowel itself is now only an entry way for other love secrets and things to be expressed and there's a there's a looking forward to that moment to be united with him and we are looking forward to the promise because we are living in a moment where the lord himself has descended with a shout according to his word what's a shout it's to gather the people not not not to a personality but he's gathering the people unto himself and then as as as we know within this this time that we're living in it it's something that we have to look forward to and i i say it within this disregards jairus had a decision that he had to make now he was already a believer but he was a secret one he was ruler of the synagogue he had a position he had a position that if he makes this decision he knows it's going to cost him isn't it incredible how god allows that that decision to hover and knowing the time see sometimes for you and i we are so we get in a hurry and let's just be honest we all do we can get in a hurry with one another get in a hurry with god about things and yet god had all of this arranged god never looked down on jairus and said ah why did it take your daughter that's not what god god had all of this arranged these the things that you and i look at sometimes and then to see how god has things so uh intricately arranged in the fulfillment of his word to where sometimes we're just looking at the fulfillment here and yet we fail to recognize all of these parts had to be in position in order for that to be fulfilled and who is it that put these pieces in position the same god who fulfilled it because these pieces are part of the fulfillment is part of it that's very very key because even when brother branham when you take the message visions of william branham and brother branham begins to go through that he was very uh excited about the uh the the the little baby being healed when graham smelling came down and picked him up and remember brother bran went right into the house he picked up the baby and prayed for it it got worse why was that was it that god's desire was not to heal that baby no it was the will of god god gave the vision and the vision cannot fail are you hearing me now god that vision can't fail this word is a vision when the holy spirit gets upon the word the word moves from print to it becomes a vision it becomes something that is open that you and i can see now what brother branham had to realize at that moment oh my goodness this baby what's going on then then he becomes aware of the vision that oh the grandmother has to be here so-and-so has to be sitting in the rocking chair with the glasses and and and you know the handkerchief here and you've heard me say these things many times and you know what even though the hat had to be here grandma had to sit there brother branham never had to tell the people put the hat here put the handkerchief here oh you put the glasses here he never had to do that when god gave the vision all of those pieces and you could say what does it matter about a hat what does it matter about a handkerchief what does it matter where who sets where because all of them are a part of the fulfillment of that vision you know what that would show to me is that we don't have to be somebody or the preacher or a deacon or a song leader we just want to be part of the vision we want to be exactly where god has us to be i want to be in and a part of what god is doing and jairus is forced to a decision but god knows how to arrange things to where this decision now that he makes he's not even worried brother grave about being ruler of the synagogue no more there's something that's greater than being the ruler of the synagogue there's something that means more than his status and that is the need that is arose for the healing of his daughter his belief he's already heard about jesus now that decision is made and here he is and he approaches the lord jesus and he says if you come to my house and you lay your hands on my daughter i know she shall be healed what is that that's faith i like how brother benny said it on saturday night you know sometimes he says people can get to such a place where we're just going to speak the word we're just going to speak the word and we're just going to speak the word we believe in that we believe in that i'm witnesses of that i witness why the word is going forth healing comes deliverance comes the holy ghost comes but i'm also aware of the word jesus never never made alterations on the word and the prophet never made alterations on the word i find brother random standing in the latter part of 1965 days before he'll be taken on home to be with the lord and he says oh i want to have a prayer line like we used to have but in building for that prayer line he preaches an absolute masterpiece of a message works as faith express and showing god's sovereignty and dropping his word so i'm just saying in this way like brother benny said brother baby said i'm a spiritual jew he said you tell you oh laying on hands that's for the jews oh i'm a spiritual jew i tell you friends listen let us never get too big you know i don't it should be when i need when we really got a need i don't care how that need has got to be met i know that jesus can meet that need [Applause] well i'm just claiming my healing i would i would look at a moment and say i want some divine assistance i want some faith to go with my faith are you hearing me now amen glory to god so when we're looking at this you know i think it begs the question that uh that we could really think upon that why are we here why are we here this morning there's got to be some reason or some purpose you got to you we've gathered here for some reason or there's it has to be that and to think before you could ever have that reason or that purpose there's already a god who already provided for that need that's why brother graham could say how many are hungering for divine healing i can ask that here this morning how many need healing in their body how many are desiring healing maybe spiritual healing and you know before before you could have that and hunger for it that shows there's already got to be a source that is present to meet your need amen before the brother graham could say before there was a creation uh there had to be a creator to create that creation he said because you believe that there's healing something has put that in your heart my mama if we could just take that right there something has put that in my heart that i i i not only do i need healing but there's a desire for healing something has put that in your heart for deliverance for the holy spirit something has put that in your heart who put that there the creator hallelujah and if there was none brother brad said if there was no healing he'd never put it in your heart are you hearing me now now you ought to really get that down and let it be personal if he didn't put it in my heart then then there wasn't then there wouldn't be anything there this is not just a whole congregation it's god coming in the midst of a people and god's speaking personally just like when we read this gyros ruler of the synagogue there were many people but you and i must step into that part of the vision like brother benny was saying about the woman there in memphis she read the bible about the of a woman but when she wrote it her need for her son's salvation she said eyes that shunammite woman now this is who i am now lord where is your elijah you see this is where you can say lord i am a believer o god now lord send the holy ghost i am a believer now lord sinned and released lord healing virtue to my life god put that there do not despise small things god put that there it's a need it's a need that has a rose in our life now i want you to think of this here for a moment that you know when you look at jairus that decision that is made it requires him to go beyond all circumstances that are surrounding him and you think of the word when we look at a need and something that's neat it's necessary it's not a want it's a need it's a need and and when you have a need of something this is when you get desperate you get desperate friends listen let's just be very plain here we are living in a world i'm not i'm not talking i'm not getting into politics we are living in a world it's been going on for years where everything is just handed right are you hearing me brother brahm talks about in the beginning of desperation he says you know he says you never appreciate anything he says like they talk about people being born with a silver spoon in their mouth you never appreciate anything the only things you appreciate is the things that you have to be desperate about and pursue is that right you don't appreciate it but you see this is where with life i tell you this the holy spirit is the gift of god how many believe that repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you can't earn it you can't merit it but being that it's the gift of the holy ghost does not mean that god is just you know sending out and just you know throwing it out there like throwing out t-shirts and hats and everything in a gathering no god gives the bible says in the book of acts god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him and where is obedience not here obedience is from the heart and that obedience is based on faith god just doesn't give it out but yet he wants to give it matter of fact he wants to give it more than you want to receive it but when your receiving of it reaches to that place like jacob when he says i will not let you go until you bless me when he gets to that place then god releases you say but say now how do i get to that place well i would just say it like this if you're aware that there's things in your life the world and and you're still loving this i still like this a little bit i still like this then i this is what i would say to you this morning don't walk away and say well i guess i'm just not ready this is what i would be doing i would be saying god remedy everything in my heart in my life that's unlike you because you'll never clean your life up you'll never straighten it out you'll never make yourself good enough you can try to quit this and quit that but if you will pray and ask god to come and take it out of your life and let him come and do that lord make me to hunger come on friends my my my so we're talking about perseverance persistence brother said that's what perseverance means it means to be persistent in trying to make a goal it's not not trying to you know you're trying to do something and you're when you're perseverant you're persistent his parents a lot of times can recall of our kids asking us over and over right unless you stop that trend now all christians listen to this statement out of perseverance i'm just reading from here all christians must be persistent they must be persevering these are some groundwork i'm even laying and the only way you're able to do this is first to have faith in what you're trying to do even those of you that are here whether you went to college trade school or you've taken on another position or job you've got to have some people that encourage you right you don't have a boss or somebody says man you can't ever do this you'll never be able to do this where a mom and dad says you'll never be able to do this or a teacher or whatever now there might be some of those uh extraneous variables and things that's out there but the reality is there is encouragement that that is along the way but in also in order to have faith in order to be perseverant in something you've got to have faith you know why because when you don't have faith you can't be perseverant and the least little trial the least little thing comes up well i guess you know there was nothing to it that's because there wasn't any faith you say brother samuel but there's got to be faith to begin with there are doves but have you continued to water and feed that faith it's like we're talking about growing tomato plants you know what them tomato plants i remember when i worked at the greenhouse and i had to you know during the january and february we'd have little and then little things were just so tiny little things about like that we'd have to take them in our hands separate them boom put them in them you know the holes and put them in those flats those things were so so small they weren't like other plants were like they were like plugs some other plants were plugs you could take them out of the plug and plug plug plug plug plug these things you had to take them out put them down and pinch the soil but you know what when you go when when i had to go back there in the greenhouse eventually in may and around the time to get them things out and and take them up front where people were buying them like hot cakes and things like that they didn't look the same way now they weren't producing tomatoes yet are you hearing me now but they were on their way they had been in a place way back there in one of them covered greenhouses we had watered them we had taken care of them but they didn't look like the plants that i planted in the beginning are you hearing me what were they receiving oh my as my bus was watering them and you know he'd be spraying that stuff on them maybe it was miracle grow that blue looking stuff i don't know if that's what it was or not but you know it was all with the preparation now i'm sure if i would have followed one of those flats it would eventually come to a place i could have went to that person's house and eventually what i within that one little plant that was about that high i'm sure eventually there would have been tomatoes we'd have been taken off of there but you see if that little thing don't make it in the ground isn't cared for isn't nourished it'll never become a plant things that god does it don't start big but it's a big god who does small things and whatever he does brother it is an awesome thing if you have no faith look what he says here if you have no faith you're just jumping at it then you cannot be perseverant but when you really know it's the truth how many know it's a truth then there's nothing going to stop you you're really perseverant then and man of all ages that's ever been able to do anything and have faith in what they're doing were perseverant there's a basis of faith we were looking at this uh a couple weeks ago there's a basis of faith you know like brother brandon talking about people talking was saying well i believe i'd go out there that fence post and you know i touched it i'd be made well no there's no basis of faith in that right i mean you find people i'm not against watching or looking at and reading all these you know books and things like that and you know eat these kind of vegetables and i'm not against all those things but sometimes there's so much faith that's placed upon those things instead of instead of coming in just simplicity not saying it's wrong to take care of our health and our body but but sometimes the things that we miss is what's important and that's the word of god the bible tells us in the book of proverbs it shall be health to thy navel come on friends i think it ought to be a time that we're we're looking for the as the word of god it's what produces a healthy life the word of god is what produces and gives you strength to resist sin hallelujah it packs within it brother i don't care what kind of microbe or not or ladybug or what kind of pest would come up there is strength in the word of god though it comes upon you he might want to try to nibble at you but there is strength within that word that's pulsating through the branches that are birthed in the vine hallelujah there's got to be a basis of faith and the bible tells us that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god listen to this statement out of perseverance i'm just quote reading from some of these quotes he said if you're a sick person in here tonight and could just have faith in god like george washington your delaware that stands before you tonight so your sickness is your delaware your unbelief or whatever that it is for your need that's your delaware yeah come on now if he says would it would have to melt away some way that you would cross it no matter what your opposition is you would still cross it now let me just pause right here as i just feel him directing me this way because when we preach on faith sometimes some listen faith is is is is what god has given to you and i for us to contact him faith is what god has a work that god does in our life to raise our faith into that place of victory in our life that then we can walk in victory but listen just because and i hope you're hearing me now i'm going to read to there's a few places in here we'll get to that just because there's something that doesn't come right away or something you're waiting on is no sign that you don't have faith well brother samuel we were praying for so and so and and you know they they died really really what i'm saying is surely there's got to be something wrong but have you considered that it could have been the timing of the lord come on friends it can be the timing of the lord and remember healing is not just something in this lifetime there's four anointings lion anointing is that right there's ox anointing there's man anointing and eagle anointing oh then those anointings have come in healing as well many times we want that of that uh you know eagle anointing just catch us away two miracle we're healed right now oh we like that when nobody wants to nobody asks for the ox anointing because that healing comes when we cross to the other side i'm glad i had one amen on that one [Laughter] but the ship but in then with him because remember all those anointings come together but the lion itself is to be able to stand there with a boldness god has spoken oh you don't feel no different but god has spoken this is god's word and if there hadn't been nobody else god wrote it for me it's something that's pulsating in my life can you explain it i don't have to explain it there's something deeper than any explanation what is that the lion roaring and then we have the man anointing surgeries doctor oh we get quiet on this one too boy you know why because we're still carrying sometimes past 11. past 11 past teachings and the prophet was very clear god performs miracles through surgery god performs miracles through medicine come on friends however god's going to do it fine with me some way one way or another then walls of jericho are coming down that's the kind of resolute don't base your faith on i don't feel this right don't feel different here no your faith is based on the word i have met god's requirements that settles it what are you going to do i'm going to wash him while i wait whoa glory be to god my my my my notice no matter what your opposition is you would still cross it you would be persistent so persistent until that cancer tumor whatever it is would never be able to stand there because you would cross over to the promise that god had given you i couldn't help but read this and time i read about different things with cancer and things like that and i think about different ones but i think about brother ron spencer you know as they've they've looked there and you know there hadn't been any any decrease in the cancer in his body the doctors told him that but you know what people around the world are wanting to know what is it that's about this man brother ron when you if you watch him minister he wears that white ribbon now why ribbon deals with for for cancer here's what the doctors have said around they've sprinted around they said if you want to see something that works watch this man he's got something that works you that people tuning in and watching it think about it i like how brother ron says stupid devil i mean to me it's like this here is a man stage four cancer he could be at home crying moping and everything else he has a right to do that but there is something greater than the circumstance faith isn't always i'm getting what i want but faith is to stand there in the midst of it all and says god is still god that's faith like the little over there stance cliff baby where brother random opens in the message messiah in 1961 and here with that statscliff baby they but they said we're going to fly you over here on a jet brother brown went and prayed about it and the holy spirit said don't touch it it's the hand of the lord i'll tell you when i hear that right there i think beyond what sister stance had just had to think i i think that took that god god was really dealing with some mature believers she didn't cop an attitude with brother branham on the phone oh so my baby ain't worth it huh you think the devil won there you think the devil the devil will oh if he would really if he really cared if he this or that but as a believer see she was a believer her and her husband and when brother branham said that that part right there god has forbidden that's the hand of the lord let me tell you something right there that requires faith trust isn't when you understand everything that ain't faith but faith is when you don't understand it i don't know how it's going to come out but that's faith the little baby went on home to be with the lord is that right and sister stansley got the feeling i must not have had faith brother brandon writes writes to her he says oh no sister sister stackliff you have great faith because he said when god made the decision to take your baby he said you stood firm so even when things don't go our way come on friends when they don't go our way this is where faith matters it's got to be a faith walk oh glory be to god men can only be persistent after they have heard from god and faith is is only based on the word of god because faith comes by hearing the word of god now you know faith the bible says this in hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance of things expected it's a substance it's the evidence of things not seen you know an evidence is something that's real substance is something that's real let me tell you something god brother branham places it this way in the message confirmation and evidence god has made man you and me in that way that we must have a confirmation for evidence god built us that way so that it would be a faith walk that what our faith is based on it's a it's an evidence in our life it's an evidence that's that's greater than any circumstance that comes up faith is a substance it's not a myth brother bram says it'd be just like if i was starving to death he said then you gave me a quarter if the loaf of bread cost a quarter boy we'd have to go back a hundred years for that one wouldn't we if it only cost a quarter right then though i don't have the loaf of bread i've got the purchasing power are you hearing me now he said i can be just as happy with the quarter as i would with the loaf of bread why because i've got already the evidence it's mine though i don't have bread in my hands though i'm not buttering up and putting jelly on it i've already got it so what is faith faith is a settled something in the heart that you just say i just know i can't explain it it's just i just know that's faith that's god working with faith within our life and god has said it in that way and that's why that the initial way the initial way of having faith is by hearing the written word of god brother adam you'll find him in the message perfect faith and then clear back here a year before in confirmation and evidence and in other places brother branham is dealing with how that in his life he's able to have a faith that anchors and he's dealing with how that that faith has been built within his life i don't want to that's that's a separate thought i know i can't continue to speak on all of that but there's a faith that he started with and it's a faith that's been built i i think it's good that we can have lives and hearts brothers and sisters around us where there ought to be a preeminent faith in other words there ought to be salt that actually causes thirst and seeing reality it's not to be like brother so-and-so or sister so and so but to say i want that faith of that faith that preeminence of christ to be so preeminent in my life just as it is in there because you realize it's not based on somebody's family tree but you have a right to partake of that same preeminent grace of god's life friends we sell ourselves too short many times if there's things that we see out before us ask god for it why do you think god's showing it god ain't showing you things to rub your nose in the dirt god's making it before you when he comes and he vindicates his word it's just like paul said my preaching and teaching was not within passing words of man's wisdom but that your faith would stand in man but that your faith might stand in the power of almighty god so many times i think we're selling ourselves too short brother brahman this message said i wonder he says he said i believe we as people don't realize the position we're in what he's talking about is there is sitting there at the tabernacle and seeing what god is doing healing taking place lives being changed the holy spirit coming and changing life the word coming forth and discerning i tell you what a position may god help us to recognize the position we're in i'm talking about right now because the past is the past you could go back oh i remember back in 93 that's history oh i remember back in 2019 that's history where are you at today with god this message is not a camp i'm preaching now this message is not a station are you hearing me and why little bethlehem brother bradham takes and he stops in that message and he's dealing with why wasn't it that he wasn't born in shiloh why was he not born here why was it little bethlehem and then brother branham will type the ministry of restoration where god said i will restore the ministry of luther the ministry of wesley and the ministry of pentecost and he says we in this hour are not called to another station you know what that means it's like on a flight sometimes we have connecting flights and you know what you don't walk off the wing of one airplane in midair to another you got to stop at a station or an airport hopefully enough time to grab a coffee hopefully they get you in there in time so you're not running to your next flight come on now we are not stopping at another station are you hearing me this message is the final unfolding of the mystery of god it's the final impartation of life and it's not just a portion but it's christ himself come down in veiled in bright form we are not stopping and that's where you have to look in your life i look in my life we are not promised a station we're promised the change of our bodies so i'm going to keep pressing on when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time he never came back and said relax relax keep relaxing keep relaxing keep relaxing people know when it came beyond from beyond the curtain of time think about it this was a man who had visitation after visitation after visitation but when he went beyond the curtain of time it affected him in such a way there were decisions that he was already resolute he became even more resolute hello he said this one experience has changed me i can never be the same william branham that i was oh wow brother sammy you mean brother brown got born again no he was already born again see one thing that brother branham could recognize and it's to speak to you and i this message is not a station it's not a praise god we made it no it goes higher and higher and higher that's where every organization failed and became an organization are you hearing me now is your life worthy of the gospel brother braham says if we fail to walk with him daily then we take on an organizational life now i would say this because i know this i would say this for every one of us in my heart included not one of us would hold our hands up and say i want an organizational life we don't want an organizational life an organizational life is not god's life is that right you can be members of churches i just had just had something here that had you know well there's there's things you know i i just had read an article this is even by a somebody that's not even walking in the in the light that we're in and here's the headline why are the churches getting so dark inside to where it's only the lights on the stage this ain't a show are you hearing me now this ain't a show but that's all churches have become it's shows run by business leaders that have never met god they've never met the pillar of fire that's why they're twisted up in their marriages that's why they can allow homosexuality that's why they can live in adultery that's why they can't preach on sin because they're still bound with sin and you can't proclaim liberty unless you're free but god has provided a liberating power in this hour it didn't have to be a new blood but the reality of that voice where satan had tried to show it up and silence it but the veil has been broken and god is no longer silent but he's speaking the opening of the seventh seal breaks the silence god is no longer silent but god is speaking openly and clearly and the blood speaks better things better things than what wesley had better things than what pentecost had it speaks better things what is it grace grace it's time for rapture [Applause] and there's a little woman on earth she's in position and she's learning in silence hello somebody she's under the headship of the word oh my and she's hearing the lovely voice of her bridegroom speaking unto her she's maturing in the time of silence not silence to us the silence to the world the initial way of having faith is by hearing the word i want you to think about brother branham would say this here i've got to find this this place in here you know when god when he says a certain thing it wouldn't matter brother branham could say it like this he says when it says a certain way it says he said this is how faith is talking about that quarter faith is something that you have and you know you got it and when you receive faith that god is then that god is going to give you this listen your healing might not be there yet what's he talking about the manifestation of it but something has anchored within you that tells you it's going to be all right now let me just try to just move beyond these these points right here let me get to where i wanted to get to today now let me just let me just move to this i don't want to say clothes because i don't want you closing me off right now let's get back to drivers can we a lot more we can say but we'll say that i just feel that's for the next let me can i read a couple of scriptures here in mark 5 35 i think it's quite at the end of the of the notes i gave you while he yet spake now remember jairus jesus is going with jairus right now they're on their way in the midst of going the woman with the issue of blood she receives her healing so it goes to show you that god is not just here just to take care of one need although he'll come to take care of one need but when god comes it may not even be your need as read in the text but you said i've got needs if i can touch the hem of his garment i shall be made whole that's the kind of faith because you know he's present notice this that daughter is dead somebody came and told him this that daughter's dead why trouble is thou the master any further now so far as humanly speaking this person is thinking why bother anymore i mean just just just let him alone it's the situation's over with oh my oh i could get it on the shouting right now in verse 36 but as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken he said to the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only belief so not only is jairus walking here with faith if i can get if he just come and lay his hands on my daughter she shall be whole if i can just get jesus to my house if i can just get jesus to my life if i can just get jesus to my need and then somebody comes along the way and said hey it's too late don't bother him anymore but here's a powerful thing the word heard it the word heard it the bible sent the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the earth doing what showing himself strong in behalf of his children the word has heard it glory be to god hallelujah the word has heard it and the word is there to address that need can't you see how if they would have jesus would have just let that go maybe jairus's faith it was waning at that point but the word came to do what energized his faith and strengthen it glory aren't you glad that god comes and encourages us oh come on friends we get down in the journey we get weak in the journey oh we're pressing towards the mark of the high calling but sometimes we get a little weary we get a little weak we get a little down we can get frustrated but aren't you glad that the word oh my the living word is present to address our need and say keep going come on let's go keep going come on let's go i need that i needed jesus i need that hallelujah oh my in another place in luke say means the same thing when they had told him in luke 8 50 when jesus heard it he answered and said fear not believe only and she shall be made whole you know why when news like that come fear just standing right there waiting to enter fear is the result of doubt worry right let's take it up to brother brown that had silver tipped grizzly and bud was sitting there brother brown i don't know what caliber you remember what caliber it was i'm not good with guns i just like bows remember what caliber it was i normally know 22. but it sure was a caliber that got brother bud nervous right it's like my brother brother brandon went to africa and and and and the model that he was shooting with in africa even brother sidney jackson are you sure all right we're talking about shooting cape buffalo yeah friends you say brothers you brother sam you just try to spiritualize everything really really over and over i'm told in the message and i see it in the word that the word of god can defeat satan anywhere anytime anyplace i'm also told and led to believe and i am a product of it how many ever witness of this right here that when the weakest christians get on their knees hell begins to tremble you know what getting your knees on back up right here we're riding artillery fire what are they doing we're calling in some reinforcements from above to drop some daisy cutter bombs on them and other things oh that's what prayer is it's greater than an atomic bomb we're calling in reinforcements right there why because we ain't backing up oh it's thick firing that's going on but i need some reinforcement there are angels all around i need reinforcement what is that faith being persistent that we are going through and we're going through this way peter would like to step in it's just like when god when god does anything for you fear would like to step in is that right fear is right there to try to step in but let the good man of the house faith stand right there remember from the beginning of this service you didn't create that within you god put that there and there's a witness that there is a healing fountain for me there is a fountain that washes away every guilty sting so here's jairus coming and between the time he makes a decision and until they get back to the house all in between here this is part of the journey this is where faith itself will declare itself jairus didn't know all this was going to happen he didn't know he was going to get that kind of news but god knew about it god knew about it and even though the case looked too great it wasn't too great for god brother brahm takes a situation in the message life is the healer he talks about when he was standing there in africa and there was a young a young boy he said a little black boy that was cross-eyed and they were setting in those eyes are just pointed in i remember now it comes remember little sharon rose brother branham went to look in upon her when she had all them flies and stuff remember she's dying brother brown prayed and you know the story that happened but from that moment god went ahead and god took her on home little sharon as well as hope but brother branham could stand right there and when he would ask me ask the question now there are the things what he went through with that right there he said would that was ask brother brown talking you know kind of like with himself in front of the audience would i go through it again would i go through that heartache again losing his wife losing his little daughter he said it hurt he said but i would do it all again because he said from that moment there's not been one cross-side baby that's been able to come in that prayer line and its eyes not be straightened out you see what it is oh friends this is why when god permits a tester trial to come your way we can all let i hope you don't misunderstand me testing trout yes but listen god never meant for us to become recluse in a tester trial and pity me and pity me that's not actually receiving the benefit because sometimes it's not even a tester trial it's our own decisions that's put us in the corner we're at tests and trials molds you shape you and even bad choices and decisions of where we become isolated if we will allow god all things work together for the good to them who are the called according to his purpose we all could get down we all could have a pity party and no doubt we do sometimes in front of the mirror come on friends sometimes we all get a little bit down and why me and why this and why isn't this going and why isn't this and well every one of us in here but think about this brother branham was able from that moment his test and the trial it became a catalyst a channel for god to manifest through let me tell you something your test or your trial is not just about you it's about the body it's about the body god permit you to go through something so that you're able then for me to enter into prayer with a more compassion than what we've had before are you hearing me also to be an encouragement to somebody else and say hey hey brother hey sister god's faithful i'm a witness of that he's seeing you through you may not feel like it see you're able to enter right in and to and to talk to him are you hearing me i don't know how many times i'll refer when somebody comes talk to me about something or like that if it's something you know that's not a private matter you see something that's going on like that and i can pull it out and say hey you know it's something that's you know wide open and known you know this person went through that with a job or this or that my goodness i can refer them right back to hey you want you need to talk to brother so-and-so they christ in them too it ain't just christ in the pastor come on lean a bunch of nickelodeons here's that little boy i'm closing that little boy here he is standing there and he comes up they put him in the line brother brown sees everything about his home and his you know everything where the father and mother and things raised in the christian home born in a christian place but bran said i look back at that little boy after standing in that vision looks back and he says i see his eyes are as straight as he said then i could say anybody sees you don't have to pray for him his little faith has made him made him whole pass him on through and about that time brother braham said he was a doctor that came running up on the stage and that doctor was trying to get to brother branham and brother bosworth holding him back he said hey wait a minute i've got a question i got a question and that doctor begins to talk to brother bram and said now what kind of mental telepathy and things like that that you were doing and brother brown turns around and says you're a doctor you know brother go through the whole thing and they send you to doctor school if if if mental telepathy will do that for people then why aren't you all why aren't they teaching you that in school i'm telling you a greater than solomon was standing there hallelujah and all of a sudden then that man he said you know that that doctor begins to talk to him and things like that he says look he said i'm the one who put him in the line he said but he says now notice he said he was standing there i saw his eyes i'm the one who put him in the line his eyes were crossed he said what happened between there and here what happened here's a simple answer god is standing here what happened between there and here god what happened between where you were at in need of your healing and the healing has come what happened in between god what happened here you showed up meeting the baptism of the holy ghost what happened between here here and there god amen it's a paradox i put them in cross and now they're no longer crossed who strained them out god straightened them out that doctor took the microphone he says then from this very moment he said i give my life to jesus christ and i make up my mind he said i'm going to serve the lord brother branham went on to tell how that doctor became a missionary let go of his practice and became a missionary he was affected between here and there sometimes the between here and there it's not real far it's from here to here hallelujah glory be to god so jairus what happened from between here and there god showed up hallelujah abraham what happened between here and there god showed up little woman that was in need of a meal and oil what happened between here and there god showed up some morning between six and nine what happened between here and there god shows up it's the in between we get too focused on stay focused on this right here this is what belongs to me the holy ghost belongs to me healing belongs to me god is moving in my life and in my heart it belongs to me let's pray heavenly father lord jesus between here and there lord we everyone in this building can identify with little gyrus that god from the moment that moment where the decision is made and gyrus moves from that place oh it's faith but oh god how we can see this morning that you encouraged jairus as he was in pursuit of his need lord it shows every one of us myself lord as a pastor this congregation and no matter lord where any life is at in their journey maybe they've just started on their journey lord we know that there's not a set time and nor is there really then as your prophet would say a set pattern yet there is lord the pattern of your word but we recognize lord jesus oh god it's the between here and there and how the lord we need encouragement lord we come to the house of god there's a purpose there's a reason lord if it's just something that is a carnal reason and it remains that way it's only a matter of time it's only a matter of time but lord i've stood lord not only to witness right here i've witnessed lord when i've stood in meetings i've stood lord in youth retreats youth camps i've had young people lord that's come and they were able to stand there and say brother samuel i came here for the wrong purpose but i'm standing here tonight i'm standing here tonight to openly acknowledge that but i want to meet jesus oh lord god you lord god are the one who could come and you're here to change purposes to give purpose and reason lord for our gathering give purpose and reason for that life being lived because we only pass this way once you are only obligated lord by your word to give us one opportunity how many times lord god you've given us opportunity after opportunity lord i pray this morning god may lord god hearts just being honest in your presence saying lord god i i want to take that opportunity may they also realize the lord hearts not only here that lord that never surrendered their lives and lord i i'm talking more than just repentance that's a first step you can't bypass that but i'm talking about really where they surrender their lives and they really get desperate to meet you where they get tired of of just going about and trying to live and on their own as far as to just make it where they say lord i want you to be the lord of my life instead of me trying to guide my life and figure this out and figure that out i'm tired of wasting time i want my life to be birthed from time into eternity to where the eternal god would come down and there would become a new creation on the inside remember you could never have that longing without first there being a creator to create that desire within you why don't you just let go and let him quench that thirst in your life [Music] right here this morning between here and there between here and there for your healing for deliverance between here and there [Music] i'll tell you i take this as a word of encouragement that the word knows exactly your need in your situation and the same god that has already brought you to that place where there is a decision that was made faith was moving that if i can just get to jesus it's settled [Music] let me just share a little something with you brother braham says many times that's what people think and they end up very disappointed because when we get to jesus there's also a battle right there as well not jesus but there's a battle going on the sarah phoenician woman when she came thou son of david and he turned to her and said woman it's not fit to take the bread and cast it unto dogs but that faith was so great it overcame every hindrance and it lowered itself it became humble in the presence of the word surely lord the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table your prophet told us it was when she called you lord that got you glory be to god between here and there [Music] i believe the lord is trying to he's speaking very clearly letting us know that between the here and there where fear and everything else can take all those things that want to try to work in there but let god feel that right there let god feel that right there hallelujah maybe you can just raise your head for a moment let me just let me just speak a little bit to you a little word of encouragement between here and there between here and there you know from years of studying and looking into the message when i've read when you look at how brother brandon brother brown would talk about brother bosworth he had such a fondness and the dearness of brother bosworth you know one of the things that brother bosworth would say to the people of god that when god has made the promise and god has confirmed that to you he said between the time of when that has taken place and the manifestation he said fill your life with god [Music] fill it with god oh my i could think of a dozen quotes in there that's scriptural that's bible let our life be filled with god [Music] i want to take everything i want it to be piled up don't you god's promised me healing in my life i'll tell you what i do i don't put up my phone when god has promised me that and i'd start listening to prayer lines from the message i'd start listening to perfect faith i'd start listening to super sense what are you doing between here and there what makes a difference god makes the difference and the word knows our need the word is right there to deserve our situation the promise is mine the promise is certain because there's a god who is certain that gave it and has vindicated his word i tell you right now it'll never happen it'll never ever happen if you go from this point and you never feel it with god but i say let's fill our lives come on friends there's a lot of things all around us and wants to fill our time fill our time fill our time fill our time fill our time but let's let it between here and there let's fill it with god why because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god brother samuel do you believe that i know it's i know it's the truth i've witnessed things that how god has had me listening to messages maybe i've you know heard this like that brother benny was speaking right here and sometimes you you know i just just felt just to write it down or something comes back and then all of a sudden here i am brother aaron may be studying or looking at something brother joy and all of a sudden the holy spirit begins to move right there in the office and direct me right back matter of fact this quote right here that i'm reading it directed me right back there yesterday on that quote from some month month and a half couple months ago and i just was listening to a service life is the healer just listening to the word put it on but you see sometimes the things we're not aware of what god is doing in the between it's not up for you and i have to worry about the in between just let god feel that place let him feel it put the message on pray and ask god say lord jesus thank you for my healing begin to thank him for what he's done anybody hear me this morning anybody determine right now that i'm going to feel affiliate with god i'm going to fill my life with god bless him i don't feel anything yet but this word has transforming power in it this message

doubt or something else or the enemy wants to try to whisper in my ear i want that word to speak out oh i wait till i get there on thursday why wait he'll do it on thursday too but let him speak to
