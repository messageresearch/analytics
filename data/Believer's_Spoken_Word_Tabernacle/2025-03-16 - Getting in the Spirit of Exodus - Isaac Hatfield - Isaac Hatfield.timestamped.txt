[35:49] chapter 1 and thank you musicians and we
[35:54] were able to be in defiance last night
[35:56] brother Wayne was speaking at the
[35:58] meeting there for brother Steven Carle
[36:01] and we just had a wonderful time and got
[36:04] to see brother Samuel and and uh we're
[36:07] just sad that you know they you know I
[36:10] some of the boys were saying that they
[36:12] wouldn't be able to make it back and
[36:13] they were apologizing I said no I I wish
[36:15] I could stay too in here brother Samuel
[36:17] so wish we could just all be together
[36:20] but we know he's got a duty to be there
[36:22] this morning so we're praying the Lord
[36:24] bless his meeting and uh appreciate the
[36:27] comment confidence that he would have us
[36:28] to be here this morning Exodus 1 we'll
[36:32] read first verse down to the 12th and
[36:35] then we'll turn to Second Kings for a
[36:36] couple verses it says these are the
[36:39] names of the children of Israel which
[36:41] came into Egypt every man in his
[36:44] household came with Jacob Ruben Simeon
[36:47] Levi and Judah issachar Zebulon and
[36:49] Benjamin Dan and naali Gad and Asher and
[36:53] all the souls that came out of the loins
[36:55] of Jacob were 70 souls for Joseph was in
[36:58] Egypt already and Joseph died and all
[37:00] his Brethren and all that generation and
[37:03] the children of Israel were fruitful and
[37:05] increased abundantly and multiplied and
[37:07] waxed exceeding Mighty and the land was
[37:10] filled with them now there rose up a new
[37:12] king over Egypt which knew not Joseph
[37:15] and he said unto his people behold the
[37:18] people of the children of Israel are
[37:19] more and mightier than we come on let us
[37:22] deal wisely with them lest they
[37:25] multiply and it come to pass that when
[37:27] they F th any War they join also onto
[37:30] our enemies and fight against us and so
[37:33] get them up out of the land therefore
[37:35] they did set over them task Masters to
[37:37] afflict them with their burdens and they
[37:39] built for Pharaoh treasure cities Pam
[37:42] and Ramsay but the more they Afflicted
[37:44] them the more they multiplied and grew
[37:46] and they were grieved because of the
[37:48] children of Israel amen now second Kings
[37:51] 3 just a couple verses here starting in
[37:53] verse 15 it says now bring me a minstril
[37:57] and it came to pass when the minstrel
[37:59] played that the hand of the Lord came
[38:01] upon Him speaking of Elisha here it says
[38:04] and he he said thus sayith the Lord make
[38:07] this Valley full of ditches for thus
[38:09] sayith the Lord You shall not see wind
[38:12] neither shall you see rain yet the
[38:13] valley shall be filled with water that
[38:16] ye may drink both ye and your cattle and
[38:19] your
[38:20] Beast amen if you have a need on your
[38:22] heart let's just lift it up before the
[38:24] Lord as we go to prayer before we're
[38:27] seated Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[38:30] for your mercy and your grace to come
[38:32] into your house once again Lord and we
[38:34] feel your presence Lord Lord just the
[38:37] worship father just such a good good
[38:39] atmosphere in the house of the Lord this
[38:41] morning just to sing your Praises Lord
[38:44] to to feel the joy of the Lord as we've
[38:47] maybe had a heavy week Lord and we we
[38:49] have work and we we're in the
[38:51] atmospheres of the world and sometimes
[38:54] it's difficult but we come to the house
[38:55] of God and there's an atmosphere
[38:58] of joy and worship where we can lay
[39:00] aside the weights of the week and the
[39:02] burdens and we can just begin to Worship
[39:04] You Lord and begin to just remember Lord
[39:08] how faithful you are Lord that you're
[39:10] always right on time and Lord you see
[39:13] the needs you see the burdens of the
[39:15] hearts this morning and Lord we invite
[39:18] you to come down into this meeting just
[39:20] once more Lord and I pray that you take
[39:22] take control of my voice Lord knowing
[39:24] that I I I'm not sufficient to meet the
[39:27] expectations of the people but Lord I
[39:30] believe you're a supernatural God and
[39:32] you can meet the supernatural
[39:34] expectations of the hearts this morning
[39:36] and I pray Lord that your word would
[39:38] just begin to minister Lord and we'll be
[39:40] sure to give you the glory and the honor
[39:42] as we commit this service into your
[39:43] hands in Jesus name amen and amen you
[39:46] may have your seats this
[39:48] morning I've been doing a little study
[39:50] on the book of Exodus and I I don't know
[39:53] what it'll turn into it may turn into
[39:55] multiple Services uh but just some
[39:57] things that have been speaking to my
[39:59] heart and just if we could just build a
[40:01] foundation this morning uh we'd like to
[40:04] speak out of those scriptures on getting
[40:05] in the spirit of Exodus getting in the
[40:08] spirit of Exodus and of course brother
[40:11] brandham speaks on the sermon getting in
[40:13] the spirit and uh in different sermons
[40:16] he talks about the importance of getting
[40:18] in the spirit and the first thing he you
[40:21] know we want to lay the foundation of
[40:22] the importance of getting in the spirit
[40:24] brother Brandon would tell us that you
[40:26] just can't do any good
[40:27] until first you get in the spirit and I
[40:30] believe that we know that's the truth
[40:32] this morning I I believe each and every
[40:34] one of us feel that in different areas
[40:36] of our lives and as a minister I feel
[40:38] that of course the necessity of getting
[40:40] in the spirit not just to preach but
[40:42] even to study and prepare for a sermon
[40:45] if you just do it in the flesh you know
[40:47] you can you can do it intellectually but
[40:50] it's so much different when the Lord
[40:51] begins to come down and begin to put
[40:54] scriptures together and lead you through
[40:56] those different Aven news and you feel
[40:58] the inspiration of it but but it's not
[41:00] just for us preachers but the singer and
[41:03] and the worshipper and the musician you
[41:05] know if we just do it in the flesh you
[41:08] know we felt maybe sometimes you come to
[41:10] service and it's a little difficult to
[41:12] to to break through those barriers you
[41:14] feel maybe it's just a little heavy but
[41:16] all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord
[41:17] begins to move down into the music move
[41:20] down into the preaching and all of a
[41:22] sudden it's a different atmosphere and I
[41:24] believe that's what we want to do this
[41:25] morning we want to get in the Spirit as
[41:28] John would write in the Book of
[41:29] Revelations I was in the spirit on the
[41:31] Lord's day brother brandom said I think
[41:34] we could just call those words the whole
[41:36] of the Christian Life to get in the
[41:38] spirit because as Paul would say if I'm
[41:40] going to sing I'll sing in the spirit if
[41:42] I'm going to pray I'll pray in the
[41:44] spirit and John had to get in the spirit
[41:47] amen to get the Revelation on the aisle
[41:49] of patmas and brother brandom said he
[41:50] didn't just get in his own spirit
[41:53] because if he just got in the spirit of
[41:54] John it wouldn't have brought those
[41:56] great vision visions and Revelations but
[41:58] he had to get in the spirit of the Lord
[42:01] and caught up into an atmosphere and
[42:03] caught up into the vision that he might
[42:05] see what the Lord was wanting to show
[42:07] him that he might write the Book of
[42:09] Revelations that would take the spirit
[42:11] of the Lord not just the spirit of a man
[42:14] John and so that's what we want to get
[42:16] in the spirit the spirit of the Lord
[42:18] because you can get into the wrong
[42:19] spirit and maybe sometimes you've
[42:22] witnessed that even in before you were a
[42:24] Christian you would get in the spirit of
[42:26] the world or get in the Spirit of of
[42:28] worldly dancing or worldly music and
[42:30] they get in the spirit they get in the
[42:32] spirit of ball games they get in the
[42:34] spirit but they're getting in the wrong
[42:36] spirit and sometimes even Christians and
[42:39] nominal Christians you know they they
[42:41] get in the spirit uh uh but they but
[42:44] they don't know the true spirit of God
[42:46] and they'll end up worshiping under uh
[42:48] denominational Spirit thinking that
[42:50] they're worshiping God but there is a
[42:53] true Spirit there is a spirit of the
[42:55] Lord that's been introduced to us in
[42:57] this hour that that that he's here as a
[42:59] prophet would stand and declare he is
[43:01] here my Ministry is to to introduce him
[43:04] he's here the Lord is here and there's a
[43:06] bride that can get in the true spirit of
[43:09] God and get caught up in the message of
[43:11] the hour and realize that that your
[43:13] vision will change it'll change how you
[43:15] look at things but but you must first
[43:17] get in the
[43:19] spirit and you know brother Brandon
[43:21] would say you know that they get in the
[43:22] spirit of their ball games and Ben he
[43:25] would say that if we're Holy Rollers cuz
[43:27] they look at us and they call us holy
[43:28] rollers but but he said if we're Holy
[43:31] Rollers then they must be on Holy
[43:33] Rollers because they're getting in the
[43:35] spirit just the same as you it's just
[43:36] that they're getting in the spirit of
[43:38] the of their games and their baseball
[43:41] and their basketball they're getting in
[43:42] the spirit of it but then they'll come
[43:44] to the house of God and sit like a a fly
[43:47] on the wall and make fun of the true
[43:49] Christian for getting in the spirit of
[43:51] the word and me because they don't
[43:53] understand it they don't get in the
[43:55] spirit of the word and so they criticize
[43:57] it just like if you went to a ball game
[43:59] and you sit there when your favorite
[44:01] team scores a touchdown and they look at
[44:03] you funny you know what are you even
[44:05] doing here if you're not going to enjoy
[44:06] yourself you know but but but it's it's
[44:09] the getting in the spirit of the event
[44:11] but when they come to the house of God
[44:13] brother Brandon would say how they
[44:14] criticize Us and how they hate the
[44:16] Christians for getting into the spirit
[44:18] of God's word he said they call us
[44:20] Fanatics and holy rollers there's
[44:22] nothing they won't do to show their
[44:24] hatred and disapproval but he said
[44:26] ignore that that you can expect it
[44:28] knowing where it's coming from just go
[44:30] on and get in the spirit of worship I
[44:33] think that's what we can do this morning
[44:35] is amen that little devil sit on your
[44:37] shoulder and he'll try to tell you well
[44:38] you're just you're just being emotional
[44:40] or you're just working it up amen but
[44:43] just ignore that critical spirit and
[44:45] just go on and get in the spirit of
[44:47] worship amen just go on and get in the
[44:49] spirit of the word amen just go on and
[44:51] get in the spirit of of the service
[44:54] because I believe that there's no limit
[44:56] to what the Lord can do amen if we as a
[44:58] preacher in a congregation would get
[45:00] caught up into the spirit amen then it
[45:03] would no longer be me and it would no
[45:05] longer be you but it would be the Lord
[45:07] moving in our midst because I don't
[45:09] believe the Lord's limited Amen to
[45:11] numbers I don't believe the Lord's
[45:12] limited amen only to the limits we place
[45:15] on him but I believe he said wherever
[45:17] two or three are gathered in my name
[45:20] there I will be in the midst of them and
[45:23] if he is here and if his spirit is here
[45:25] then I believe that there's nothing that
[45:27] he can't do this morning amen you may
[45:30] have walk in here brother Aaron with a
[45:32] hard week amen and you come into the
[45:34] house of God and as the scripture says
[45:37] sometimes the spirit is willing but the
[45:39] flesh is weak amen and that's why this
[45:42] morning we're not here just to get into
[45:44] the flesh because if we get in the flesh
[45:47] amen then we we'll never get anywhere
[45:49] because the flesh is up and down and the
[45:51] flesh will have you thinking one day
[45:53] you're saved and the next day you're not
[45:55] that's why you're not saved by your
[45:57] feelings and you're not saved by your
[45:58] flesh but you're saved amen by your
[46:01] faith in the word of God Amen as a
[46:03] preacher this morning I don't come here
[46:05] to preach to your flesh I didn't come
[46:07] here just to preach Amen to your
[46:09] reasoning and your affections I come
[46:11] here to preach to your soul because I
[46:13] believe amen this morning that no matter
[46:15] what situation you're going through no
[46:17] matter what it looks like with the
[46:19] natural eyes I know that there's a soul
[46:21] down there beyond the trouble beyond the
[46:24] circumstances and the word that I preach
[46:26] is the message of the hour amen by the
[46:29] help of the Lord I know that if that
[46:30] word begins to penetrate through your
[46:33] troubles and through your trials amen
[46:35] there's a soul in there that will begin
[46:36] to say Amen to the word of God am me
[46:39] because your flesh might not want to
[46:41] amen the word but your soul will say
[46:43] Amen to every word written in this Bible
[46:46] amen and that gives me a hope as a as a
[46:49] preacher of this gospel amen that no
[46:51] matter how dark it looks no matter how
[46:53] cloudy it seems if this word would just
[46:56] begin to go forth it'll begin to contact
[46:59] that spirit and that spirit will start
[47:01] to contact back and say amen amen and
[47:04] before you know it'll begin to draw you
[47:06] out of the heaviness of your weak and
[47:08] out of your burdens and your soul will
[47:10] be lifted up and caught up in the spirit
[47:13] and something will change the atmosphere
[47:16] will start to shift and you'll realize
[47:18] amen that that that that I've had a hard
[47:20] week but the spirit of the Lord is here
[47:22] Amen to turn it around he's here to heal
[47:25] he's here to deliver he's here to set
[47:27] the captive free he's here to bring you
[47:30] out of where you're at and lift you up
[47:33] oh and pour out a Revival upon your life
[47:35] I believe there's Revival available I I
[47:38] I don't I know that this nation amen
[47:40] she's passed Revival but I believe to
[47:42] the individual under the message of the
[47:45] hour there is a Revival amen and it's an
[47:47] unending Revival because it's a Revival
[47:50] that comes from the word I mean it's not
[47:53] just coming from emotion it's not a
[47:55] Revival that just comes from the music
[47:57] we don't have to beat it up this morning
[47:59] we don't have to pound it out of the
[48:00] altar but the word of the hour has been
[48:03] released and it's a message of spirit
[48:05] and truth and as it's released if you'll
[48:08] just get under it and begin to become a
[48:11] receiver amen of what the Lord is
[48:12] sending in the shower it'll bring a
[48:14] Revival in your life oh but you've got
[48:17] to get in the spirit of Revival to
[48:18] receive a Revival brother Brandon would
[48:20] say am mean that a minister can't bring
[48:22] the Revival amen ex except the people
[48:25] would get in the spirit of it to receive
[48:28] a Revival am me because I a man of God
[48:32] can only do so much amen but the Lord am
[48:34] mean I believe he's already promised us
[48:36] every blessing and every promise in this
[48:39] Bible but we've got to get in the spirit
[48:41] to receive it say Lord whatever you have
[48:43] for me today I'm willing and I'm ready
[48:45] and I'm open to receive what you have
[48:48] for me today oh Revival it means to
[48:51] bring back amen and just like that oh
[48:55] the way I come in today I was driving
[48:57] along that Lakeside and and brother
[48:59] Brandon would tell us that that Lake
[49:01] when those waves go to tossing and
[49:03] turning there's not any more water in
[49:05] that Lake amen than on a still day but
[49:08] what it is it's washing the trash out
[49:11] amen and that's what Revival means amen
[49:13] it means to wash the trash out of your
[49:14] life it doesn't just mean to add new
[49:16] members to the church it means to revive
[49:18] what's already there oh and sometimes
[49:21] amen you lose your joy sometimes you
[49:23] lose your peace and all you need is a
[49:25] good old fashioned God sent Holy Ghost
[49:28] Revival Amen to bring back what you've
[49:30] lost to bring back your joy and to begin
[49:33] to restore and wash out of your life all
[49:35] the filth of the world Amen that's what
[49:38] brother brandom showed us in the message
[49:40] getting in the spirit out of Second
[49:42] Kings there he begins to say how that
[49:44] minstral begin to play the music and
[49:47] that's what actually brought the prophet
[49:49] into the spirit anden you see it in the
[49:51] life of David how the Lord would use
[49:54] Music even to cast out Spirits amen they
[49:57] said how you know people try to take
[49:58] music out of the church amen but how
[50:01] it's it's an instrumental part of God's
[50:04] program Amen to begin to make the way
[50:06] for battle to get the people in the
[50:09] spirit that the Lord might move and here
[50:11] the spirit of the Lord begins to come
[50:13] down upon as the minstral plays and the
[50:16] the spirit of the Lord begins to come
[50:17] upon Elisha and Elisha begins to see a
[50:21] vision because Elisha was a prophet and
[50:23] God's program for dealing with a prophet
[50:26] is through VIs vision and brother brand
[50:28] said how did the Lord you know begin to
[50:29] deal with him and then brother Brandon
[50:31] begins to tell us that Elisha saw a
[50:33] vision amen and here he is and there
[50:35] they are in this situation and Elisha
[50:37] begins to have a vision and brother
[50:39] Brandon begins to say what you know what
[50:40] was the vision he didn't tell him to go
[50:43] and amen put on better uniforms he
[50:45] didn't tell him to go amen and go to
[50:47] schools of theology he didn't tell him
[50:49] to go and get better Weaponry he said
[50:52] just get to digging am mean and there is
[50:54] water and mean because the children
[50:56] children of Israel anden walked through
[50:58] that desert years ago and when they were
[51:01] in the desert there was a rock in the
[51:03] wilderness that would give them water
[51:05] and brother Bram said the water from
[51:06] that rock was still laying under that
[51:09] sand and if they would just get to
[51:10] digging and mean they would have access
[51:12] to the same water amen that Moses had
[51:15] access to and the children of Israel had
[51:18] access to oh and I believe that water is
[51:21] still laying there this morning and that
[51:23] a Believer can dig out the logs of
[51:25] excuses and condemnation amen the logs
[51:29] of it's not for me amen it was just for
[51:31] my parents but the same water amen that
[51:34] your parents got to tap into amen is
[51:36] still laying this morning that our young
[51:38] people can get to digging in the same
[51:40] Revival amen every generation gets a
[51:43] chance at Revival and that same water is
[51:45] still available this morning amen if we
[51:48] could just get to digging amen Revival
[51:50] is available for the Church of God this
[51:52] morning amen a refreshing is available
[51:55] this morning but you got to get the logs
[51:57] out and mean you got to get the logs out
[51:59] amen that mean I'm going to make a fool
[52:02] of myself or am mean my friends are are
[52:05] going to think I'm crazy aen but as you
[52:07] start to digging those logs out you'll
[52:09] realize amen that that water is still
[52:11] there and you may not see the evidence
[52:13] of it right away and mean but if you'll
[52:15] just keep digging and mean the rain may
[52:18] not fall but there's a source of water
[52:21] amen that's willing and ready to come up
[52:23] to the surface amen and feed your soul
[52:26] if you'll just get the logs out brother
[52:28] Brandon would say am me get the logs out
[52:30] he would
[52:31] say I think it's pretty you don't hear
[52:34] brother brandom talk about Tides much I
[52:37] don't feel like but here he says you hit
[52:38] an Old Log there what is this 10% of my
[52:41] wages he said we've been having soup
[52:43] sers to pay our preacher dig that old
[52:45] lock out log out there get it out there
[52:47] you oh God a tent I thought that's free
[52:51] this morning I'm just dropping that in
[52:52] there I thought that was pretty uh
[52:54] pretty funny how the prophet would talk
[52:56] about that here he's saying you know
[52:59] sometimes it's a log that lays in the
[53:00] way of a believer's life because you
[53:02] think well you know that was just under
[53:05] the law and I don't owe God my tithes
[53:07] but amen it's a log and if you ever dig
[53:09] it out it'll open up a blessing in your
[53:11] life amen because what you reap amen you
[53:14] will s and what you cast your bread upon
[53:17] the Water it will return unto you and if
[53:19] you want to open up a Channel of
[53:21] blessing in your life anden then give to
[53:23] the kingdom of God anden to watch the
[53:25] Lord begin to bless you amen I don't
[53:28] know how I'll do it but I know it's a
[53:30] law in the word of God Amen and it works
[53:33] amen but it's a log oh but if we just
[53:36] get all the logs out this morning amen
[53:39] and get into the vision amen because I
[53:42] like how brother brandom said it he said
[53:43] as long as you say bless God I'm
[53:45] Methodist I don't have to put up with
[53:47] such I'm Baptist I'm assemblies I'm
[53:48] oness all right go ahead he said you'll
[53:51] never see the
[53:53] vision but you throw that thing aside
[53:55] and get into the vision see Jesus coming
[53:58] and the church perishing here and get
[54:00] into the vision dig right down brother
[54:02] I'm telling you something will happen to
[54:04] you then you'll get in the spirit of
[54:06] Revival amen that's what we want this
[54:09] morning is to get in the spirit of it
[54:12] forgive me if I get
[54:14] comfortable amen and I like how he says
[54:17] it there because he says get into the
[54:19] vision because I don't know about you
[54:22] but the Lord may not deal with you with
[54:24] actual Visions but we've had a Prophet
[54:27] come and the word of the Lord comes to
[54:30] the prophet and so when the prophet came
[54:32] on the scene and mean the prophet would
[54:34] see a vision and the prophet would see
[54:37] the vision for this age and the vision
[54:39] for this generation and so you don't
[54:41] have to see a vision this morning you
[54:43] just have to get into the vision am me
[54:46] you don't have to see a vision of of how
[54:48] everything's going to work out but we've
[54:50] already had a vision and so go ahead and
[54:52] get into the vision I mean I like how
[54:55] brother Brandon would deal with people
[54:56] in the prayer lines and in one place
[54:58] he's talking about and I don't know if
[55:00] it was a vision but he's telling the
[55:02] person that there's a well person
[55:04] standing out just in front of you and he
[55:06] said Jesus Christ is calling you to that
[55:08] well body and what you do is you just
[55:10] keep walking he said he said now by
[55:13] faith as you close your eyes walk right
[55:15] into that well body then just keep
[55:17] walking just keep on going and that's
[55:20] how you do it this morning if you're
[55:22] sick or if you're in if you're in a
[55:24] situation you get a vision out out in
[55:26] front of you of a well body or a
[55:29] delivered body and and you start walking
[55:31] into that Vision amen without Vision the
[55:35] people perish and if a church loses its
[55:37] vision and mean it'll be turning one way
[55:39] and another way and don't know where to
[55:41] go amen but if you just get a vision
[55:44] this morning and start walking into that
[55:46] Vision all things are possible amen and
[55:49] I believe we don't need a new vision I
[55:51] believe we've already got the message of
[55:53] the hour but maybe your eagle eyes have
[55:55] got filmed over and I pray this morning
[55:57] the Lord would open up to us as
[55:59] individuals a fresh Vision amen a fresh
[56:02] vision of the coming of the Lord a fresh
[56:05] Vision to get Soul saved a fresh Vision
[56:08] Amen to see our loved ones come home
[56:10] Amen to see our sick healed to see our
[56:12] bound toiv and and if we just get a
[56:14] vision and start walking towards that
[56:16] Vision amen I believe all things are
[56:18] possible am mean you may have a crippled
[56:20] hand and mean and you get prayed for and
[56:23] that hand is just as crippled as it ever
[56:25] was but once you get a vision then it
[56:28] doesn't matter how crippled your hand is
[56:30] and mean you've got a vision and you
[56:31] just start walking and you might be able
[56:33] to move it a little bit at a time and
[56:36] the next day a little more but all of a
[56:38] sudden you'll be living in the vision
[56:40] and mean because it was a word vision
[56:43] and mean because it was a scriptural
[56:45] vision and mean we believe that God am
[56:48] mean his word is infallible and once he
[56:50] speaks it amen it's got to come to pass
[56:53] if you approach it upon the same basis
[56:56] and amen he's bound to his word amen
[56:58] it's like putting on a pair of glasses
[57:00] brother Aaron amen and before we come
[57:03] into this message our vision was blurry
[57:06] and mean our vision was cloudy it was
[57:08] just a denominational Vision but when
[57:10] you put on the glasses of this message
[57:13] oh you could see clearly am me because
[57:15] the prophet is lacking onto an eagle and
[57:17] our prophet got up in that Watchtower
[57:20] and he T us things that are to be and
[57:22] amen he taught us amen modern events
[57:25] made clear by prophet Y and when you put
[57:27] on this message and you let it become
[57:29] your vision am me it'll open up a whole
[57:32] new world unto you anden and you won't
[57:34] just be blinded by the dark Glade of
[57:36] seing condition but you'll have an Eagle
[57:39] Vision to look out and mean you'll be
[57:41] able to discern Spirits amen by the word
[57:44] of God and know where you stand who you
[57:46] are and where you came from anden where
[57:48] you're going to be amen because it
[57:51] brings Clarity to your life it brings
[57:53] Vision to your life amen that you know
[57:56] amen that you have amen a a
[58:00] destination amen Seasons may change but
[58:02] the vision doesn't change amen seasons
[58:05] are going to come and seasons are going
[58:07] to go amen transitions might come amen
[58:10] loved ones might pass away none of these
[58:13] things change the vision and mean you
[58:15] might lose your job am mean you might
[58:17] have a mistake you might fall down amen
[58:20] but the vision says get back up you've
[58:22] got somewhere to go and mean we've got
[58:25] somewhere to we've got somewhere to get
[58:27] to we we we're not just here amen just
[58:29] to be am mean Gathering service after
[58:32] service just to play church but we've
[58:34] got a vision and mean we we've got a
[58:36] goal to attain you and it can only be
[58:39] attained through the message of the
[58:42] hour if we look at the definition of it
[58:45] sometimes I like definitions it just
[58:47] opens things up to you and just a uh I I
[58:51] sometimes it's it makes it clear to me
[58:53] and and if we look at the definition of
[58:55] the phrase get in the spirit it says to
[58:58] fully embrace the enthusiasm and
[59:00] positive attitude surrounding a
[59:02] particular event or occasion Often by
[59:05] actively participating in activities
[59:08] related to it and uh adopting its theme
[59:12] and and that struck me when I begin to
[59:14] look at that because if you want to get
[59:16] in the spirit of the Season you're
[59:18] living in you adopt the theme of that
[59:20] season and right now we're coming into
[59:23] spring season so you put away the winter
[59:25] decoration
[59:26] and you begin to bring out the spring
[59:28] decorations because you're adopting the
[59:30] theme of the season and you know when we
[59:33] get into football season people amen
[59:35] very strongly be basketball whatever you
[59:38] adopt the theme of the season and
[59:40] they'll put on their jerseys and you
[59:42] know say I I'm an Ohio State fan or I'm
[59:44] this fan or I'm that fan because what
[59:46] are they doing they're adopting the
[59:48] theme amen uh of the identity that
[59:51] they're taking on the theme and mean
[59:53] when they get in the spirit of the
[59:55] season they adopt the theme of the
[59:57] season and me but Satan is is a shrew
[1:00:00] devil and what he'll try to do is try to
[1:00:02] get you to adopt the wrong theme and he
[1:00:05] try to get your confession to begin to
[1:00:07] say well I'm depressed or I'm anxious or
[1:00:11] I I I'm not going to make it and if he
[1:00:13] can just begin to sew seeds of Doubt am
[1:00:16] me into your theme then before you know
[1:00:18] it it'll become the whole theme of your
[1:00:20] life and me in your very theme and
[1:00:23] you'll begin to get in the spirit of
[1:00:25] depression and get in the spirit of
[1:00:27] anxiety until it's just like a cloud
[1:00:30] hanging over your head Amen in every day
[1:00:33] that that that becomes your theme amen
[1:00:35] but but Satan is such a liar this
[1:00:38] morning and God sent us a word amen not
[1:00:41] just to sit on the letter to put it in
[1:00:43] your mouth and begin to confess the word
[1:00:46] of God and let it become the theme of
[1:00:48] your life and mean when Satan tries to
[1:00:51] get you to take on his theme you say no
[1:00:53] devil am mean I'm a son of God I'm a
[1:00:56] daughter of God and this morning I'm
[1:00:58] free I am healed I'm delivered amen by a
[1:01:02] Stripes I'm Healed if they lay their
[1:01:04] hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:01:06] amen and that's the theme of my life
[1:01:08] because I'm a Christian am mean and when
[1:01:10] I became a Christian I adopted the theme
[1:01:13] of being a Christian and because I'm a
[1:01:15] Christian I pray I read my Bible and
[1:01:18] Christ becomes the theme of my life am
[1:01:21] me because it's just who I am amen and
[1:01:24] when you ever can get your identity
[1:01:26] settled anden by revelation God begins
[1:01:29] to show you who you are and mean then
[1:01:31] you no longer have to wonder what your
[1:01:33] theme is amen but your theme becomes
[1:01:36] settled in the word of God that I'm
[1:01:38] going to make it the Rapture is for me
[1:01:41] amen the body changes for me the
[1:01:43] marriage separates for me and mean
[1:01:45] because I know who I am and I know what
[1:01:48] my theme is that's why this morning
[1:01:50] we're speaking on getting in the spirit
[1:01:52] of Exodus because there they were down
[1:01:54] in that land amen but they had a theme
[1:01:58] they were getting in the spirit that
[1:01:59] this is not where we belong but we're
[1:02:01] going to come out of here one day
[1:02:03] because Exodus means called
[1:02:05] out and so there they were and there
[1:02:08] they were down in that land amen but God
[1:02:11] had already promised Abraham I mean in
[1:02:15] Genesis 15 that the Seed of Abraham
[1:02:18] would be a Stranger in a Strange Land
[1:02:20] that wasn't theirs and they would
[1:02:21] sojourn there for 400 years but
[1:02:24] afterward they would come out
[1:02:26] with great substance and the iniquity of
[1:02:28] the amorites wasn't yet fulfilled in the
[1:02:31] land that he had promised them and me
[1:02:33] the amorites dwell there and Giants
[1:02:35] dwell there but when their time was up
[1:02:38] they would have to give way because the
[1:02:40] children of Israel were going to come
[1:02:42] out and possess that land am mean but
[1:02:45] brother brandom says that sometimes the
[1:02:47] cogs of God's will turn slow but they
[1:02:50] turned sure and he said God makes
[1:02:52] everything work together just right just
[1:02:55] like car coming together and sometimes
[1:02:58] you'll look out and you say how's it
[1:02:59] going to be amen but those cogs of
[1:03:02] Prophecy amen they're turning amen those
[1:03:05] great grinding wheels of God's prophetic
[1:03:08] anden they're always turning sometimes
[1:03:10] slow but always sure amen and some of
[1:03:13] our elders this morning have watched
[1:03:16] them turn for a lot longer than I have
[1:03:18] amen but have they always been sure
[1:03:20] brother and me has this message always
[1:03:22] Vindicated itself amen time and time
[1:03:25] again what about sister have they always
[1:03:27] been sure and mean they've always worked
[1:03:29] together just right am me but sometimes
[1:03:32] we look through our natural senses of
[1:03:34] time and sight and brother Bram said
[1:03:36] time and sight are two of God's worst
[1:03:39] enemies because neither one declare
[1:03:41] anything about God and we want it done
[1:03:43] right away but God takes his time about
[1:03:46] things and so we realize sometimes
[1:03:48] there's a time of waiting but there's
[1:03:50] coming a time of Deliverance and me
[1:03:53] sometimes you find yourself waiting
[1:03:55] wondering how's this going to work out
[1:03:58] how's this all going to play out oh but
[1:04:00] the time of Deliverance is coming and
[1:04:02] may because God's promises are true oh
[1:04:05] my if you look at literature there's
[1:04:08] actually a word it's called the day
[1:04:09] newon and it's the word in literature
[1:04:13] where the the the final loose ends of
[1:04:15] the plot get get tied together at the
[1:04:18] very end it's the closing scenes of of
[1:04:21] the literature where the author begins
[1:04:23] to tie together all the Loose Ends of of
[1:04:25] the plot amen and sometimes that's how
[1:04:28] it is in life it looks like a lot of
[1:04:30] loose ends amen but it's just coming
[1:04:32] down to that final chapter in those last
[1:04:35] moments where the author Our Father
[1:04:38] begins to tie together all the Loose
[1:04:40] Ends isn't that what this message came
[1:04:42] to do it come to tie together the loose
[1:04:45] sins of doctrines and when were men of
[1:04:47] God had tried to tie them together but
[1:04:50] they could never get him just right but
[1:04:52] God sent a prophet to tie those loose
[1:04:54] ends together and now we have a message
[1:04:57] and it's not loose but it's tied it's
[1:05:00] perfect Gathering a bride for a Rapture
[1:05:03] oh but if he did it for the message and
[1:05:05] mean can he do it for his children and
[1:05:07] mean and you look at your children and
[1:05:09] mean and they're still out in the world
[1:05:11] and you say God how's this going to work
[1:05:13] out but God has a way in the closing
[1:05:16] scenes of the book Amen to tie those
[1:05:19] strands together he has a way in the
[1:05:22] darkest moment to step in on the scene
[1:05:25] am me and bring healing and bring
[1:05:26] prodigal home oh I I believe he's able
[1:05:30] to do it this
[1:05:31] morning amen I think of my wife she has
[1:05:34] a testimony where uh she was I think a
[1:05:38] uh maybe about 18 years old and and we
[1:05:41] had had some uh troubles and we had been
[1:05:43] together and got apart and it was it was
[1:05:45] my fault and man I just I I told it at
[1:05:49] the church the other day and I kind of
[1:05:50] made it sound a little bit like it could
[1:05:52] be her fault and I I think I had to
[1:05:55] apolog oliz because it was my fault I I
[1:05:58] I wasn't you know committing the way I
[1:06:00] should have been and so we had some
[1:06:02] trouble and anyway she got into a spot
[1:06:05] where you know she was pretty ready just
[1:06:07] to move back down to Arkansas she you
[1:06:09] know she she had lived up here but she
[1:06:11] was having some trouble and she was
[1:06:12] ready just to move away and mean but we
[1:06:15] had a New Year's Eve service and we had
[1:06:18] kind of a popcorn style meeting where
[1:06:20] all the brothers were getting up and it
[1:06:21] was the first time I ever spoke
[1:06:23] personally in the church and I got up
[1:06:25] and I began to speak and and me it was
[1:06:27] just special for me and there at the end
[1:06:29] of the service uh Brother Ray got up and
[1:06:31] he began to pray and the power of the
[1:06:33] Lord fell down in that building and it
[1:06:36] struck her where she was at in her seat
[1:06:38] and she got up you know her confession
[1:06:40] and her testimony she got up from there
[1:06:42] a different person than when she went
[1:06:44] down and even desires and things that
[1:06:46] she was struggling with were gone amen
[1:06:49] from the moment she went down to the
[1:06:50] moment she came up she was a different
[1:06:53] girl and there just a few weeks later
[1:06:55] she uh we started dating and just a few
[1:06:57] months later ien she married a preacher
[1:07:00] and now we have a son but if you looked
[1:07:02] at it in your naturalized amen it looked
[1:07:04] pretty dark as a parent of of a daughter
[1:07:08] it looked like she was about to move
[1:07:09] away and and she was about to take a
[1:07:12] wrong direction but just in a moment God
[1:07:14] could change that direction and I
[1:07:17] believe it can happen in a moment this
[1:07:19] morning and mean it looks like a mean
[1:07:21] your child or your loved ones going a
[1:07:23] certain way or maybe even you sitting in
[1:07:25] the house of God this morning in your
[1:07:27] spirit and mean you're ready to go the
[1:07:29] wrong way but the power of God begins to
[1:07:31] drop down and it begins to turn your
[1:07:34] direction and let you know that no
[1:07:36] that's not the way to go just like
[1:07:38] brother Brandon when he was there lost
[1:07:40] in the mountain trying to guide a me but
[1:07:42] God would put his hand down on his
[1:07:44] shoulder and turn him around and say no
[1:07:46] the Mountain's this way and mean and God
[1:07:49] will not lose a one of his this morning
[1:07:51] and his hand is not too short that it
[1:07:53] can't reach down and set your path on a
[1:07:56] Rapture path and on an eternal path oh I
[1:08:00] believe he still got a hand to turn down
[1:08:03] amen and when the time of waiting is
[1:08:05] over the time of Deliverance will come
[1:08:08] and God will not lose a one of his amen
[1:08:11] but youve got to keep the theme don't
[1:08:13] get discouraged and well-doing don't get
[1:08:15] weary and praying and seeking the Lord
[1:08:18] for the answer am mean because God is
[1:08:21] moving and mean there they were down in
[1:08:23] the in the lands of Egypt
[1:08:26] am mean but there was a something in
[1:08:27] Jacob's heart because Circumstances had
[1:08:30] led them to the desert and me brother
[1:08:32] Brandon's begin to say that drought had
[1:08:34] driven them down into the lands of Goan
[1:08:36] and led them into Egypt and there they
[1:08:39] were standing there but Jacob was
[1:08:41] determined although they were spending
[1:08:44] amen hundreds of years in Egypt there
[1:08:47] was something about him that they never
[1:08:48] lost the vision brother Dave of Exodus
[1:08:51] because Jacob there down in the land of
[1:08:53] Egypt he said don't you leave my my
[1:08:55] bones here when I die because we're
[1:08:57] coming out of here one day amen and
[1:09:00] Joseph said no don't bury my bones he
[1:09:03] said you can put them in a casket but
[1:09:05] don't bury them here in Egyptian land I
[1:09:07] mean because we're going to leave here
[1:09:09] one of these days you see they never
[1:09:11] lost the vision and me because job had
[1:09:14] had a revelation and mean that in my
[1:09:16] flesh I will see God Amen and it may not
[1:09:19] have been written in scripture but those
[1:09:22] Patriarchs caught the Revelation and
[1:09:24] Abraham was buried where job was buried
[1:09:27] and Sarah was buried where job was
[1:09:29] buried and Isaac was buried and Jacob
[1:09:32] and Joseph said no don't bury us here
[1:09:34] because the resurrection is not going to
[1:09:36] take place in Egypt it's going to take
[1:09:38] place in the promised land so bury my
[1:09:40] bones in the promised land oh friends
[1:09:44] and brother brandom said I caught the
[1:09:46] spiritual revelation of the coming of
[1:09:48] the Lord and he said that's why I left
[1:09:50] the Baptist Church because I knew that
[1:09:53] the resurrection wouldn't take place in
[1:09:54] the Baptist church or the Methodist
[1:09:56] Church but it would take place in Christ
[1:09:59] and so he buried himself am me in the
[1:10:01] spirit of the Lord amen that on the
[1:10:03] resurrection morning and me brother
[1:10:05] Brandon will be a part of it because he
[1:10:07] didn't bury himself in just a
[1:10:10] denomination but he buried himself in
[1:10:12] Christ Oh by one Spirit we're baptized
[1:10:15] into one body and it's the same spirit
[1:10:17] that raised up Jesus from the grave
[1:10:19] brother shame if it dwells in you it'll
[1:10:21] also Quicken your mortal body so if you
[1:10:23] want to get in the spirit of Exodus
[1:10:25] you're going to have to get in the
[1:10:27] spirit of God am me because that's where
[1:10:29] this Exodus is taking place oh it's not
[1:10:32] taking place in a church it's not taking
[1:10:34] place under a certain one man Ministry
[1:10:37] it's taking place under the spirit of
[1:10:40] the revealed word for our day that God
[1:10:43] sent through a prophet oh we're going
[1:10:45] out of here one of these days and I
[1:10:47] think it's important to remember it
[1:10:48] friends I think we ought to get in the
[1:10:51] spirit of it am mean that we're not here
[1:10:53] to stay in this world
[1:10:55] you ever go on a vacation I mean you're
[1:10:58] just gone for a couple days and so it's
[1:11:00] hard to get settled into the hotel or
[1:11:03] the condo or the Airbnb and sometimes
[1:11:06] you just live out of a suitcase and mean
[1:11:08] because you know I'm here but I'm not
[1:11:10] here to stay and that's how it is in
[1:11:13] this world friends we're here but we're
[1:11:15] not here to stay and mean we brought
[1:11:17] nothing into this world and it sure will
[1:11:20] carry nothing out amen but but but but
[1:11:23] here we have no continuing City am mean
[1:11:25] like Abraham we're pilgrims and
[1:11:27] strangers amen but we're seeking a city
[1:11:29] to come that's why we don't lay up our
[1:11:32] Treasures here on Earth but we lay up
[1:11:34] our Treasures in Heaven amen where moth
[1:11:37] and dust cannot corrupt it amen because
[1:11:40] we have a city that we're going to oh
[1:11:44] sometimes you might have to forsake
[1:11:45] houses and lands here on this side amen
[1:11:48] but just remember amen that you are not
[1:11:51] of this world Amen but you have a
[1:11:53] Heavenly Home amen where God can repay
[1:11:56] everything that you forsaken on this
[1:11:58] side oh my that's why we seek first the
[1:12:02] kingdom of God am mean because we're not
[1:12:04] in the leay of the see in spirit of am
[1:12:06] mean I'm rich and I have need of nothing
[1:12:08] amen but I'd rather be rich in spirit
[1:12:11] than rich in wealth of this world and
[1:12:13] mean because one of these days all the
[1:12:15] wealth of this world will be burnt with
[1:12:16] fire amen but there'll be a bride amen
[1:12:19] out of mar supper amen caught up in the
[1:12:21] heavenlies AM mean because she didn't
[1:12:23] just get in the spirit of this world but
[1:12:25] you got in the spirit of God oh my and
[1:12:28] we're going out of here one of these
[1:12:30] days amen we're not here to stay friends
[1:12:33] am we're not of this world we're only
[1:12:36] here for a season we're in it but we're
[1:12:38] not of it amen I'm American by natural
[1:12:42] birth but by spiritual birth I came from
[1:12:45] the back part of the mind of God and one
[1:12:47] of these days he's going to call me back
[1:12:50] oh that's home this isn't home but
[1:12:52] that's home and we're going home home
[1:12:56] and if we're going home if God's calling
[1:12:58] us out of this world as the scripture
[1:13:00] says iath Not Seen Nor Ear heard what he
[1:13:03] has in store for those that love him and
[1:13:05] if he's calling you out I believe he has
[1:13:08] somewhere better to take you I mean I
[1:13:10] don't believe God would call you and if
[1:13:12] you feel the tug of God this morning
[1:13:15] calling you higher we don't have to be
[1:13:17] scared and me say Lord I'm comfortable
[1:13:19] where I'm at but if he's calling you out
[1:13:21] he's got somewhere better to take you
[1:13:24] amen so we got to follow the leading of
[1:13:26] his
[1:13:28] spirit I think it applies to our trials
[1:13:31] I think it applies to our sickness I
[1:13:33] don't think that we should ever get
[1:13:35] complacent Amen in anything the devil
[1:13:37] throws at us but I think we should look
[1:13:39] the devil in the eye and say devil I'm
[1:13:42] here but I'm not here to
[1:13:44] stay Amen brother brandom said it he
[1:13:46] said that's what he's spreading this
[1:13:48] morning to you sick people you sick
[1:13:50] people that seems like you're going to
[1:13:51] sit there all your life if the devil can
[1:13:54] get you to believe that he's got you I
[1:13:57] mean you see that's what the devil would
[1:13:58] try to get you to believe this morning
[1:14:00] that you're just going to sit there all
[1:14:01] your life that you're always going to be
[1:14:04] sick or maybe in the spiritual that
[1:14:06] you're always going to be in that
[1:14:08] condition you're always going to go
[1:14:09] through those Cycles you're always going
[1:14:11] to remain there amen but it's just the
[1:14:13] devil amen trying to get you to put your
[1:14:15] Stakes down in Egypt but that's not
[1:14:18] where you belong this morning am me
[1:14:20] brother Brandon said about this little
[1:14:22] girl he said she had bad ankles and high
[1:14:24] blood meure and many things wrong with
[1:14:27] her and brother Bram said Satan would
[1:14:28] give her a stroke if he could he would
[1:14:31] lay her up yonder on the bed of
[1:14:33] Affliction he'll put her out of
[1:14:35] commission in he can for he don't want
[1:14:37] her testimony and me and that's the this
[1:14:40] morning when Satan Whispers in your ear
[1:14:43] that you're always going to stay there
[1:14:44] amen and you begin to wonder maybe
[1:14:46] that's really the truth amen but Satan
[1:14:48] don't wants your testimony and that's
[1:14:51] why he'll try to keep you down and mean
[1:14:53] because he don't want your testimony and
[1:14:55] mean he don't wants you to rise to the
[1:14:57] potential that God is calling you to and
[1:15:00] mean because God can bring healing to
[1:15:03] that sickness and when brother Brandon
[1:15:05] begins to tell about that little girl
[1:15:07] they said people who don't understand
[1:15:09] would ask why why is she in this
[1:15:11] condition why is she here and then he
[1:15:13] begins to tie it to that little boy who
[1:15:16] was blind in scripture and they would
[1:15:18] ask him why are you blind because your
[1:15:20] mother sin or your father sined and they
[1:15:22] said no neither but that the works of
[1:15:24] God might be made manifest that little
[1:15:27] boy was blind and it said I believe
[1:15:29] that's why this little girl has gotten
[1:15:31] this condition and me not because of sin
[1:15:34] me but that the works of God might be
[1:15:35] made manifest oh glorymen don't let the
[1:15:39] devil lie to you and mean and sometimes
[1:15:41] I know there's special cases but
[1:15:43] sometimes you find yourself in a trial
[1:15:46] and Satan will try to tell you that it's
[1:15:47] because you sin or because some
[1:15:49] generational curse amen but tell that
[1:15:52] Devil he's a liar and get determined to
[1:15:55] be a testimony for the kingdom of God
[1:15:57] and say no devil I'm determined not to
[1:15:59] stay here I'm determined to come out of
[1:16:02] this sickness I'm determined to be a
[1:16:04] testimony I'm determined to let my life
[1:16:07] and me be for the glory of God that I
[1:16:09] was not built to stay in this sickness
[1:16:12] but I'm going to come out of here oh
[1:16:14] you've got to let it be your testimony
[1:16:16] friends amen because Satan if if you're
[1:16:18] not careful Satan will try to build you
[1:16:20] up in a complex if you've been sick a
[1:16:22] long time and try to get you to get an A
[1:16:24] comp complex of self-pity and me then
[1:16:26] you want everybody to pity you because
[1:16:28] you're sick but if you're not careful
[1:16:31] self-pity becomes an enemy to healing
[1:16:34] and mean and self-pity will hold you in
[1:16:36] the cage and keep you in a complex of
[1:16:39] sickness I mean and you want everybody
[1:16:41] to pet you and me but it's a complex and
[1:16:43] and brother Brandon found himself in
[1:16:45] that complex one time he said when he
[1:16:47] was in a meeting for eight days or
[1:16:49] whatever it was he got in that complex
[1:16:51] but then he heard an eagle scream when
[1:16:54] he picked up a book by FF Bosworth
[1:16:56] called Christian confession and it said
[1:16:58] a Believer doesn't look at what you see
[1:17:00] with your eye but you look at what you
[1:17:02] see by faith oh and that'll break every
[1:17:05] self-pity complex and mean you might
[1:17:07] have been there like the woman at the uh
[1:17:10] with the blood issue with 12 years she
[1:17:12] had that blood issue but brother Brandon
[1:17:14] said she never had self-pity but when
[1:17:17] the master came by amen she said this is
[1:17:20] my chance to be made well and I believe
[1:17:23] amen this morning no matter how how many
[1:17:25] years you've been in that condition and
[1:17:27] just one sweep of the master this
[1:17:29] morning and if you don't let yourself
[1:17:31] get into self-pity but recognize the
[1:17:34] moment and say no I'm not going to sit
[1:17:36] here in a complex the Master's here and
[1:17:39] this could be the service of my healing
[1:17:42] this could be the service of my
[1:17:43] Deliverance this could be My
[1:17:46] Moment oh amen that man at the pool of
[1:17:49] Bethesda he was sick for 30 some years
[1:17:52] and but he didn't lay there in a pity
[1:17:55] but he'd recognized his moment with the
[1:17:57] master oh I think of Abraham and Sarah
[1:18:00] 25 years they waited on that promise and
[1:18:04] but what did they do did they sit there
[1:18:06] and say wowy wowy me it's been so long
[1:18:09] when's it going to happen no they went
[1:18:11] into the store and they bought booties
[1:18:13] and they bought a crib and they begin to
[1:18:16] think Sarah what will it be when Isaac
[1:18:19] comes what will it be like to hold him
[1:18:22] what will it be like to to feed him a
[1:18:24] bottle and nurse him anden but what were
[1:18:26] they doing they were adopting the theme
[1:18:28] of the oncoming
[1:18:30] promise oh friends and mean that's what
[1:18:34] if you I I'm sure you all know the
[1:18:36] testimony of Mariah puit she had that Al
[1:18:39] thecia where she was losing her hair
[1:18:41] amen but she didn't let it become the
[1:18:43] theme of her life amen but she took
[1:18:46] those bobby pins and she began to adopt
[1:18:49] another theme and she brought those
[1:18:51] bobby pins in that prayer line and she
[1:18:53] said I'm here but but I'm not here to
[1:18:55] stay I'm determined to be a testimony
[1:18:58] for the glory of God and tonight or this
[1:19:00] morning she has long hair and then
[1:19:03] because she didn't stay in that
[1:19:05] condition but she adopted the theme of
[1:19:07] her
[1:19:08] Deliverance oh and it led to it amen she
[1:19:11] got her healing amen but she had to
[1:19:14] maybe change her
[1:19:16] expectation maybe maybe the devil would
[1:19:19] try to get her just to expect just you
[1:19:21] might as well expect that one day you're
[1:19:23] going to be totally bald amen because of
[1:19:25] this sickness that's what it does you
[1:19:27] might as well expect it but maybe one
[1:19:29] morning she had to drive down a Stak no
[1:19:31] I'm not going to expect to be totally
[1:19:33] bald I'm going to expect to have a head
[1:19:36] full of hair because I serve a mighty
[1:19:38] God am me I I I know what that's like
[1:19:42] have you ever been there and mean you're
[1:19:43] going through a valley and and and I've
[1:19:45] been there where where you come to
[1:19:47] church and if you're not careful you'll
[1:19:49] actually get in a spot where you just
[1:19:51] expect to to not be able to maybe enjoy
[1:19:53] the service because maybe maybe you're
[1:19:55] going through a season where you have
[1:19:56] young children or you're going through a
[1:19:58] season of sickness and it's hard for you
[1:20:01] to enjoy the service like you used to
[1:20:03] and the devil will try to get you down
[1:20:06] into a discouragement until you start to
[1:20:09] expect to have a bad day or a bad
[1:20:12] service amen but that's when you got to
[1:20:14] change your expectation and that's when
[1:20:16] you stop expecting trouble in heartache
[1:20:19] and bad days and you start expecting the
[1:20:22] god of Miracles Amen to come on the
[1:20:24] scene and turn the situation
[1:20:27] around oh you say no devil I'm going to
[1:20:29] start expecting my healing I'm going to
[1:20:32] start expecting amen change to
[1:20:35] come amen like brother BR said you heard
[1:20:39] about the lady that prayed for the
[1:20:40] mountain to be moved and got up the next
[1:20:42] morning and looked out the window and
[1:20:44] said just as I expected still
[1:20:46] there he said that's the reason she
[1:20:49] expected it that's right am mean but
[1:20:51] what about the sir phenician woman am
[1:20:54] mean that when the Lord Lord would tell
[1:20:55] her that you know she was like a dog and
[1:20:57] she said oh yes Lord but even the dog
[1:21:00] eats the crumbs from the master's table
[1:21:02] and he said because of thy saying go thy
[1:21:04] way thy daughter shall be made well and
[1:21:07] me and she went her way and she didn't
[1:21:09] say well Lord you should do it this way
[1:21:11] or Lord you should do it that way but
[1:21:13] whatever the Lord spoke she expected to
[1:21:16] find it that way and when she went home
[1:21:18] her daughter was well in the bed because
[1:21:21] she expected what the Lord had spoken to
[1:21:23] come to pass
[1:21:25] and I believe if the Lord spoke it you
[1:21:27] have a right to expect it amen we are
[1:21:30] not amen Children of the devil we are
[1:21:32] children of the promise and I believe
[1:21:34] you have a right to let your expectation
[1:21:38] match who you are anden you're not just
[1:21:40] a denominational church member friends
[1:21:43] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ who
[1:21:46] we've been given the authority of the
[1:21:48] spoken word and when under inspiration
[1:21:51] you speak a promise you have a right to
[1:21:53] expect that word to come to pass you
[1:21:56] have a right to expect that mountain to
[1:21:58] move amen because am mean that's who you
[1:22:01] are you are adopted Sons and Daughters
[1:22:04] of God am mean you're not just Fly by
[1:22:06] Night amen amen intellectual Christians
[1:22:09] you're word born amen word filled Sons
[1:22:12] and Daughters of God Amen that have a
[1:22:15] right Amen to expect the promises of God
[1:22:18] to manifest in your life amen and maybe
[1:22:21] not the way you think they should or
[1:22:22] ought to amen but the way that God said
[1:22:25] they would amen it'll happen just the
[1:22:27] way he said it
[1:22:29] would am mean even if it don't look
[1:22:31] possible he's the god of the impossible
[1:22:34] and he always is right on time look at
[1:22:37] look at them in the book of Exodus look
[1:22:39] at what they were going through when
[1:22:41] they come up right up to the brink of
[1:22:43] Exodus and when they're raised up a
[1:22:45] pharaoh who knew not Joseph and as we
[1:22:48] read in the opening scripture and the
[1:22:50] Pharaoh and mean there it was I believe
[1:22:52] it was SEI Pharaoh had honored Joseph
[1:22:55] believed he was a prophet and respected
[1:22:57] him but when Ramsay raised up he didn't
[1:23:00] respect Joseph and he began to turn
[1:23:02] against the children of Israel I mean
[1:23:05] and he had no a mean maybe spiritual
[1:23:08] reasoning but was just a maybe just uh
[1:23:11] uh believed in the power of of you know
[1:23:14] the government and he was beginning to
[1:23:16] turn against that religious side he
[1:23:18] didn't believe in the freedom of
[1:23:19] religion but he began to persecute the
[1:23:22] children of Israel and said put task
[1:23:23] Masters over over them and put put put
[1:23:26] put them in prison and make them build
[1:23:28] bricks because and mean if they get
[1:23:30] strong they might join up with our
[1:23:32] enemies and come against us and so Satan
[1:23:35] begin to try to stop the oncoming
[1:23:38] visitation am mean but but but he would
[1:23:40] say mid wise if it's a if it's a if it's
[1:23:43] a Manchild you need to kill it at the
[1:23:45] birth or and mean eventually would tell
[1:23:47] them you need to throw it in the river
[1:23:49] but what was he doing and because
[1:23:51] brother brandham told us that there's
[1:23:53] three powers to an Exodus he said
[1:23:55] there's the power of Satan the power of
[1:23:57] faith and the power of God and he said
[1:24:00] Satan mostly knows God's program and he
[1:24:03] tries to interfere and he usually always
[1:24:05] acts first and so when God is performing
[1:24:08] in Exodus Satan mostly knows I like that
[1:24:13] mostly amen he mostly knows enough to
[1:24:16] try to interfere amen but he doesn't
[1:24:18] know enough or have enough power to stop
[1:24:21] it amen so we try to interfere by
[1:24:24] cutting off Moses life amen and he's
[1:24:27] tried to interfere by cutting off Abel's
[1:24:29] life and cutting off Christ and killing
[1:24:32] him on a cross and but no matter but no
[1:24:35] matter how much he tries to interfere he
[1:24:37] can't stop God's program and mean
[1:24:41] because God's program is going to go on
[1:24:43] friends nothing can stop the program of
[1:24:45] God and there he tried to stop it like
[1:24:49] brother Brandon would say in the message
[1:24:50] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:24:53] he said there was sat and trying to stop
[1:24:55] the oncoming visitation for Abraham and
[1:24:57] Sarah and and what he'll do is he'll try
[1:25:00] to come like on a Sunday morning he'll
[1:25:03] try to give you a hard morning and try
[1:25:05] to get you just to say well this is just
[1:25:07] going to be a bad day I guess it's just
[1:25:10] something's wrong maybe I've sinned
[1:25:12] maybe I've done something wrong and you
[1:25:13] begin to let yourself drop down into a
[1:25:16] confusion of of worry and maybe have you
[1:25:19] displeased the Lord or have you done
[1:25:20] something wrong but many times it's just
[1:25:22] Satan trying to stop and oncoming
[1:25:25] visitation and if you can just recognize
[1:25:27] it on a Thursday night or on a Sunday
[1:25:29] morning when you've begin to feel that
[1:25:31] feeling maybe you have a car accident on
[1:25:33] the way to work and you begin to think
[1:25:35] something's wrong and you get all
[1:25:37] frazzled but that's not the time to get
[1:25:39] frazzled that's the time to put down a
[1:25:41] steak and say Satan I see what you're
[1:25:43] doing the Lord must have something for
[1:25:45] me today so I'm going to go to the house
[1:25:47] of God and receive my
[1:25:49] blessing amen because Satan can't stop
[1:25:52] it oh brother br they try to put an end
[1:25:55] to this shouting they try to close the
[1:25:57] church doors and mean they try to shut
[1:25:59] this message down and me but they can't
[1:26:01] stop God's program am mean they can't
[1:26:04] stop the coming of the Lord am mean
[1:26:06] because it's God's program and there's
[1:26:09] not enough powers in hell to stop
[1:26:12] it oh he said you know they tried to
[1:26:15] burn it out they tried to feed it to
[1:26:17] Lions but every time they try to
[1:26:20] persecute the church we read it in
[1:26:22] Exodus 1 that the more they persecuted
[1:26:24] them the stronger they got and that's
[1:26:27] what Satan does to you the more he tries
[1:26:29] to persecute you and hit at you and
[1:26:31] pound at you he's trying to destroy you
[1:26:34] but because there's a seed in your life
[1:26:36] you can't be destroyed so instead you
[1:26:38] just end up getting stronger than ever
[1:26:40] before am mean he's tried to blow on the
[1:26:43] fire of God's word amen for generations
[1:26:46] and generations amen but the more he
[1:26:48] blows the bigger the Fire gets because
[1:26:51] it's not been lit by man but this fire
[1:26:53] has been lit by God and Satan tried to
[1:26:55] blow it out but it's burning this
[1:26:58] morning stronger than ever before
[1:27:00] because it's found a place and Sons and
[1:27:02] Daughters of God and Satan Winds of of
[1:27:06] confusion and Winds of Doctrine and
[1:27:09] winds amen of controversy have tried to
[1:27:11] blow against your life and get you to
[1:27:13] stop believing this message but all it
[1:27:16] does is shakes up your roots enough that
[1:27:18] they might grow deeper and you say Satan
[1:27:20] no I believe it more than ever before I
[1:27:23] trust it like never before and me
[1:27:26] because if you haven't got me yet I have
[1:27:28] confidence that you'll never get me I
[1:27:30] must be a Son of God I must have come
[1:27:34] from God oh and I must be going back to
[1:27:37] God because Satan's tried to destroy me
[1:27:39] but he
[1:27:39] can't oh he's tried to stop you brother
[1:27:42] Dave but he can't and mean he can't stop
[1:27:44] what God has started and mean he can't
[1:27:47] break what God has mended and mean he
[1:27:49] can't destroy what God has fixed I mean
[1:27:52] because it's the work of the Lord and is
[1:27:54] mighty and it's
[1:27:56] strong oh my God has sent us a message
[1:27:59] to prepare us for Exodus and me brother
[1:28:01] BR preaches a message preparation and
[1:28:04] begins to lay a foundation how before
[1:28:06] God does anything he always prepares for
[1:28:09] it and God is always prepares the people
[1:28:12] for the events that's just about to
[1:28:14] happen and we've seen it throughout all
[1:28:16] the scripture and me in the days of Noah
[1:28:19] God prepared a man to come on the scene
[1:28:21] and begin pounding away at an ark that
[1:28:24] that the people might have a way of
[1:28:25] Escape in the days of Noah that the that
[1:28:28] God will prepare an escape for his
[1:28:31] church and brother Bram said God is
[1:28:33] preparing a church today to be saved
[1:28:35] just that he as he did in the days of
[1:28:37] Noah in the ark he said I believe the
[1:28:39] people are in the preparation of the
[1:28:41] last great destruction this world will
[1:28:43] ever know and skipping down he says
[1:28:46] they're in the spirit of the last days
[1:28:48] and God cannot send destruction before
[1:28:50] the people are in the spirit for
[1:28:52] Destruction he said cannot be War until
[1:28:55] people get in the spirit of War amen and
[1:28:58] so they're getting in the spirit of the
[1:28:59] last days amen and brother Brandon
[1:29:01] begins to you know show us and we we see
[1:29:04] it all around us how you know they're
[1:29:06] they're making movies about it they're
[1:29:08] building their bomb shelters they're

[1:29:12] spirit of just a a religious spirit just
[1:29:15] and mean go to a denomination and live
[1:29:17] any sort of way and think that they're
[1:29:19] fine but brother Bram said the world's
[1:29:21] got to get in the spirit of the last
[1:29:23] days before the last days can come and
[1:29:25] we're in the spirit of the last days but
[1:29:27] here he says God in another message let
[1:29:30] us be in the spirit of Christ tonight so
[1:29:33] we can have
[1:29:34] Christ let us be in the spirit of
[1:29:37] repentance a spirit of Faith give it to
[1:29:40] us
[1:29:41] tonight amen you see how the world is
[1:29:44] getting in the spirit of destruction we
[1:29:46] see how Israel is getting in the spirit
[1:29:48] to receive her Messiah they're they're
[1:29:50] making preparations Amen to for for for
[1:29:54] they're coming they're they're getting
[1:29:55] together their their their relics and
[1:29:57] their instruments they're getting

[1:30:06] together that they might build the Third
[1:30:07] Temple and me to welcome back their
[1:30:09] Messiah and maybe they don't understand
[1:30:12] how it's going to come like we do but
[1:30:13] they're getting in the spirit of it and
[1:30:15] when we see that as a bride we know am
[1:30:18] mean there's a people getting in the
[1:30:20] spirit am me of an exodus and mean
[1:30:22] there's a bride getting in the Spirit am

[1:30:26] see the world getting in the spirit of
[1:30:28] destruction we see Israel getting in the
[1:30:31] spirit of their Messiah and as a bride
[1:30:33] am mean we've received a message that's
[1:30:35] put us in the spirit amen to get out of
[1:30:38] here amen we're not going to be here
[1:30:40] forever but there is a time where God
[1:30:42] will call us off of this Earth amen but
[1:30:45] he sent us a message to put us in the
[1:30:47] spirit of it oh my friends as it was in
[1:30:51] the days of Noah as it was in the days
[1:30:54] of lot so shall it be in the revealing
[1:30:56] of the son of man and me in the days of
[1:30:58] Noah they got in the spirit of
[1:31:00] destruction but there was some elect
[1:31:02] that got in the ark because they
[1:31:04] recognized that there was a prophet in
[1:31:06] the scene and preparations were made
[1:31:09] that they wouldn't have to go through
[1:31:10] the destruction but there would be a way
[1:31:12] of Escape oh in the days of lot they got
[1:31:15] in their Spirit they married wise they
[1:31:17] they did all these things but there was
[1:31:19] an Abraham amen that would come out of
[1:31:21] the systems amen and receive the
[1:31:24] preparations and oh friends we've been
[1:31:26] put in the spirit of preparation by the
[1:31:29] message of the hour and that said oh the
[1:31:32] plagues are coming but before that comes
[1:31:34] behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:31:37] before the coming of the great and
[1:31:39] Dreadful day of the Lord that you might
[1:31:41] be dressed in the garments of the word
[1:31:44] that you might prepare oh to leave out
[1:31:47] of here Amen in Luke 17 it said that
[1:31:50] there'd be two in the field one would be
[1:31:51] taken one would be left Amen in the
[1:31:54] message was sent in this hour anden and
[1:31:57] amen it might have left the one next to
[1:31:59] you but it picked you up anden it began
[1:32:01] to reveal the son of man to you I mean
[1:32:04] this message begin to call your name and
[1:32:06] it was separating you amen for Rapture
[1:32:09] like it separated the wheat from the
[1:32:11] tears and the Goat from the sheeps this
[1:32:13] message began to call you out and
[1:32:15] separate you for the coming of the Lord
[1:32:18] am mean it's always been am mean in the
[1:32:20] first Exodus he sent Moses accompanied
[1:32:22] by the pillar of Fire fire in the second
[1:32:25] Exodus he sent John the Baptist to
[1:32:27] prepare way for his first coming am mean
[1:32:30] and let him know and there was the
[1:32:31] pillar of fire in that day but in this
[1:32:33] Exodus he sent us to Elijah accompanied
[1:32:36] by the same Pillar of Fire calling us
[1:32:39] out of the systems and calling us into
[1:32:41] the millennial reign with him amen he's
[1:32:44] always sent a message and a messenger to
[1:32:46] prepare people for Exodus that you
[1:32:49] wouldn't be left here Amen in confusion
[1:32:51] that you wouldn't be left here but she
[1:32:53] would say come out out of her my people
[1:32:55] and come up oh how would they know how
[1:32:58] to prepare how would they know how to
[1:33:00] apply the token how would they know how
[1:33:02] to prepare the Passover and put the
[1:33:04] staff in their hands and the shoes on
[1:33:06] their feet unless there was a Moses in
[1:33:08] the land oh and how would you know how
[1:33:10] to prepare how would you know how to be
[1:33:12] dressed in the word how would you know
[1:33:14] how to apply the token unless God had
[1:33:16] sent a Moses in this hour to say friends
[1:33:20] this is what you need to do apply the
[1:33:22] token get Des put it on display get your
[1:33:25] families under it and me get them under
[1:33:28] that blood like Rahab under that scarlet
[1:33:30] cord oh prepare yourself and mean he
[1:33:33] warned us of the coming destruction but
[1:33:35] he also gave us the material to prepare
[1:33:39] oh that we might not have to stay
[1:33:41] here oh it's written in Revelations 18
[1:33:45] as we begin to draw it down it says I
[1:33:48] saw after these things I saw another
[1:33:51] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:33:53] having great power and the Earth was
[1:33:55] lightened with his glory and he cried
[1:33:57] mightily with a strong voice saying
[1:33:59] Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen
[1:34:02] and has become the habitation of devils
[1:34:04] and the hold of every foul Spirit and
[1:34:06] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:34:09] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[1:34:11] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[1:34:14] the kings of the Earth have committed
[1:34:15] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:34:17] of the Earth are waxed Rich through the
[1:34:19] abundance of her Delicacies he said I
[1:34:22] heard another voice from
[1:34:24] Heaven saying come out of her my people
[1:34:27] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:34:30] and that you receive not of her plagues
[1:34:32] anden brother BR said then God sent an
[1:34:34] angel a messenger to what call out come
[1:34:37] out the message of the hour is come out
[1:34:41] of the systems anden brother Bram said
[1:34:43] in Revelation 17 it speaks of mystery
[1:34:46] Babylon and reveals who that is and then
[1:34:49] immediately after that it began to
[1:34:51] reveal and call come out of her and mean
[1:34:54] Revelation 17 revealed what it was but
[1:34:57] Revelations 18 there come a voice saying
[1:35:00] come out of her my people and brother
[1:35:02] brandham ties the voice of Revelations
[1:35:05] 10:7 to the voice of Revelations 18:4
[1:35:08] that at the sounding forth of the
[1:35:10] message of the hour it would call a
[1:35:12] bride out of the systems at the same
[1:35:15] time that those seals were open there
[1:35:17] was a loosening amen of the word that
[1:35:20] begin to sound forth and call you come
[1:35:23] out of confusion come out of the systems
[1:35:26] he didn't say he said you don't have to
[1:35:27] leave your church oh but that spirit
[1:35:30] will begin to call come out from among
[1:35:33] the confusion you don't have to be
[1:35:35] confused any longer about what's the
[1:35:37] truth and what's not am me this message
[1:35:40] isn't just amen some from some amen
[1:35:42] hillbilly voice this came from Heaven
[1:35:45] it's a scriptural message it's the voice
[1:35:47] of God in this last day saying come out
[1:35:50] of the systems and be birth
[1:35:54] oh into the liberty of the word for your
[1:35:57] day oh I believe it's a season of it I
[1:36:00] believe I believe it's the season of
[1:36:02] coming out as the scripture says come
[1:36:04] out from among them and be separate
[1:36:07] touch not their unclean thing and I will
[1:36:08] receive you oh brother Brandon said if
[1:36:11] there ever was a coming out time it
[1:36:13] ought to be right now and mean he said
[1:36:15] in the message the way of a true Prophet
[1:36:18] I think it's a time it's just about
[1:36:20] another coming out party another Boston
[1:36:22] Tea Party has to say Oh Glory I believe
[1:36:27] it's time this morning another coming
[1:36:29] out party because what you know in that
[1:36:31] days of that Boston Tea Party in
[1:36:34] 1773 and mean there was some I mean just
[1:36:37] some common people who had left the old
[1:36:40] land and they come into the new land
[1:36:42] amen but they were trying to tax their
[1:36:44] tea and make it uh impossible amen for
[1:36:47] them to you know operate in the liberty
[1:36:49] of the new land and there was taxation
[1:36:52] without representation and they were
[1:36:54] getting tired of living in the new land
[1:36:57] under the old rulership and mean and
[1:37:00] they actually were called that group was
[1:37:02] called the Sons of Liberty amen and they
[1:37:05] got so tired of it that they begin to
[1:37:06] get in the spirit and they begin to put
[1:37:09] pain on their face and dress up like
[1:37:11] Indians and go out and throw all that
[1:37:13] tea off the boat anden and you know
[1:37:15] those actions didn't just stop there but
[1:37:17] a few short years later they led the way
[1:37:20] that they would sign the Declaration of
[1:37:21] Independence that they would know no
[1:37:23] longer be tied to that old Union but
[1:37:26] there would be a new Union of Liberty
[1:37:28] and I believe that that's what this
[1:37:30] message came to do and me it came and
[1:37:33] mean that there would be some Sons of
[1:37:34] Liberty and mean that would come out
[1:37:36] from the methodists and the Baptists and
[1:37:37] the Lutheran and mean and you didn't
[1:37:39] just come to the new land to live under
[1:37:42] the rulership of the old land and mean
[1:37:44] you didn't just leave the Creeds and me
[1:37:47] to stay under bondage but you come to
[1:37:49] the message to be married to the
[1:37:51] anointed word for your day and and this
[1:37:53] is the word now am mean this isn't a
[1:37:57] denomination this is the word and you've
[1:37:59] got to die to the old denomination to be
[1:38:02] birthed into the new and you've got to
[1:38:05] die to those Creeds to be birthed into
[1:38:07] this word and we didn't just come into
[1:38:10] this message to bring the chains of the
[1:38:12] old Union into this message but this
[1:38:15] message brought us Liberty this message
[1:38:18] brought us freedom and mean it begin to
[1:38:21] let you know and mean that if your name
[1:38:23] was on the Lamb's Book of Life then it's
[1:38:26] not whether you shout or whether you
[1:38:27] don't it's not whether you dance or
[1:38:29] whether you don't and the Pentecostals
[1:38:32] were all about it but a prophet would
[1:38:34] come and say whether you speak in
[1:38:35] tongues or whether you don't if your
[1:38:37] name is on the L's Book of Life and me
[1:38:40] then you're a Freeborn Son of God and
[1:38:42] you have a right to enjoy the Liberties
[1:38:45] of the message of the hour you have a
[1:38:47] right to feed on the word for your day
[1:38:49] and mean and you're not under a nicolan
[1:38:51] spirit and me that you've got to run and
[1:38:54] mean you know and oh we don't have to
[1:38:55] bring a measuring tape to the house of
[1:38:57] God every Sunday and measure the skirts
[1:38:59] and measure this and that anden get him
[1:39:02] in the message get him under the pillar
[1:39:04] of fire and oh give him an exodus and me
[1:39:07] that oh it'll become a liberty and not
[1:39:09] because someone said do it not because
[1:39:11] Pastor said do it but because oh there's
[1:39:14] a new life amen the Holy Spirit Will
[1:39:17] Lead You In All truth the holy spirit
[1:39:19] will take the makeup off the Holy Spirit
[1:39:21] Will Am me get you back on level ground
[1:39:23] and put modest clothes on you and me
[1:39:26] it'll take the earrings off it'll it'll
[1:39:28] take all care of all
[1:39:30] that oh you see if you just make it a
[1:39:32] land of legalism or a land of fanaticism
[1:39:35] you have a bunch of robots amen that are
[1:39:37] just listening to what some man told him
[1:39:39] to do but I'm thankful for God sent
[1:39:42] pastors and God sent men of God that'll
[1:39:44] just preach the message in its Liberty
[1:39:47] anden and in his power and let the
[1:39:49] anointing of the word amen begin to
[1:39:51] shape the people into the image that God
[1:39:54] desired to see in his bride oh this
[1:39:57] message is perfect I mean the the
[1:40:00] legalism was already shaved off the
[1:40:02] fanaticism was already shaved off when
[1:40:04] God sent us this message am mean it was
[1:40:06] a pure word amen that we could enjoy it
[1:40:09] and feast on it amen with Liberty
[1:40:13] without condemnation that we might be
[1:40:15] free amen and we might know who we are
[1:40:19] and me because it called us into our
[1:40:21] identity anden because this third X
[1:40:23] Exodus is calling a bride out of a
[1:40:25] church and there they were and there
[1:40:27] they were in the time of that Boston Tea
[1:40:29] Party brother Dave and they were
[1:40:31] gathering and what they would do is they
[1:40:33] would call themselves by the name of the
[1:40:35] state that they lived in they would say
[1:40:37] we're Virginians or or or we're North
[1:40:39] Carolinians or whatever the first
[1:40:41] colonies were there you know they say
[1:40:44] we're this and we that but as they begin
[1:40:45] to gather against this system they begin
[1:40:48] to call themel for the first times
[1:40:52] Americans can can imagine that the first
[1:40:54] time that was ever uttered forth were
[1:40:58] Americans say well well well I'm a I'm
[1:41:00] I'm a Virginia no now you're an American
[1:41:04] and can you imagine and mean as these
[1:41:07] seals begin to open for the first time a
[1:41:09] prophet begins to say so that you might
[1:41:12] understand I no longer call you church I
[1:41:14] call you bride you're no longer
[1:41:17] Methodist you're no longer Baptist
[1:41:19] you're no longer Lutheran I call you
[1:41:21] bride and that you might know know that
[1:41:23] you have been Loos from your old
[1:41:25] marriage like you never done it in the
[1:41:27] first place and you've been married to
[1:41:29] the word for your day and and you're
[1:41:32] Justified as though you never did it in
[1:41:34] the first place oh that old Taskmaster
[1:41:37] that's been beating you for years and
[1:41:39] years that thing is dead and drowned in
[1:41:41] the sea and the message is calling you
[1:41:43] to your identity saying no you're my
[1:41:46] bride amen because that's a coming out
[1:41:48] party that's the party we've had because
[1:41:51] if you look at the world and when they
[1:41:53] have coming out parties it's actually
[1:41:55] it's a perversion in the season we're
[1:41:57] living and they'll get their families
[1:41:59] together and say I'm no longer a boy or
[1:42:01] I'm no longer a girl what a sick
[1:42:03] perverted devil and but if that's true
[1:42:06] in the negative what about in the
[1:42:07] positive and when the message begins to
[1:42:09] call your name it's saying come out of
[1:42:11] her my people and you say oh for the
[1:42:14] first time your eyes get open and you
[1:42:17] say that's why I've always been
[1:42:18] different that's what made me different
[1:42:20] from my friends and from the school and
[1:42:22] from all the world it was a jean seed on
[1:42:25] the inside of your heart and that seed
[1:42:27] began to get pulled and tugged by the
[1:42:30] message of the hour saying you're my
[1:42:32] bride you were never meant to be a part
[1:42:34] of that system you were never meant to
[1:42:36] be bound in Traditions and dogmas and
[1:42:38] Creeds come out into your true identity
[1:42:41] and when the bride recognizes its its
[1:42:43] position in who she is then the Rapture
[1:42:46] will go and that message begin to sound
[1:42:49] forth and let you know brother Shane who
[1:42:51] you are and where you came from and
[1:42:53] where you're going that's true oh
[1:42:55] calling you to your identity calling you
[1:42:58] come out of the confusion and mean
[1:43:00] because we read it in Revelations
[1:43:02] 18:2 and it would say that it was a cage
[1:43:07] trapped that system was a cage to every
[1:43:09] unclean bird I mean we could read it
[1:43:11] again but we read it for the sake of
[1:43:13] time and brother brother Brandon begins
[1:43:16] to say how sure they were trapped in
[1:43:18] that cage vultures and chickens but he
[1:43:21] makes it very clear that there was no
[1:43:24] Eagles in that cage of unclean birds all
[1:43:27] that World Council of churches it
[1:43:29] trapped a lot of chickens it trapped a
[1:43:32] lot of vultures oh but the Eagles were
[1:43:35] all called out under the sounding of
[1:43:37] that message I mean you were not left
[1:43:40] behind amen and because he didn't leave
[1:43:42] you behind in the system and mean he
[1:43:44] won't leave you behind for the
[1:43:46] tribulation because that Jean seed has
[1:43:48] already been caught up into the Heavenly
[1:43:50] places and if that seed has been
[1:43:52] quickened already anden then you've
[1:43:54] already made it anden then that same
[1:43:56] spirit that raised you up from the Creed
[1:43:59] into the Living Word will also Quicken
[1:44:01] your mortal bodies oh Hallelujah there's
[1:44:05] no Eagles in this cage it's an eagle age
[1:44:08] and mean you were born for the skies you
[1:44:10] were born to be an eagle and mean we're
[1:44:12] no longer under an old age as brother
[1:44:15] Brandon would begin to tell us this is
[1:44:17] Eagle time am me that's prophesied in
[1:44:19] Revelations 10:7 and Malachi 4 that it
[1:44:22] would come an eagle age an astronaut age
[1:44:26] where a people would be lifted up above
[1:44:28] the world called out of Le DEA oh and
[1:44:31] begin to tell you that there's four
[1:44:33] beasts in Revelations 4 he said there's
[1:44:35] a there's a lion and there's a ox and
[1:44:39] there's a man and there's an eagle and
[1:44:40] he said those four beasts were sent to
[1:44:42] combat the four horse riders and he said
[1:44:45] the lion combed the Roman age and the ox
[1:44:48] combed that Dark Age of that martyrdom
[1:44:51] and that man combed that amen
[1:44:53] intellectual age those were the
[1:44:55] reformers Martin Luther and and Knox and
[1:44:57] the reformers but he said in the evening
[1:44:59] time there would come forth a flying
[1:45:02] eagle anointing that would combat the
[1:45:05] age of Darkness Le to see and Antichrist
[1:45:08] Spirits all around but there would rise
[1:45:10] a prophet under an eagle anointing and
[1:45:13] me that would combat that system and
[1:45:15] because you belong in this Eagle age
[1:45:17] you're not under an ox anointing you're
[1:45:19] not under a lion anointing you're not
[1:45:21] under a man anointing but you're under
[1:45:23] an eagle anointing and you just can't
[1:45:26] help but be the spirit of the age that
[1:45:28] you dwell in oh and God knew what age to
[1:45:31] place you and mean he didn't place you
[1:45:33] in the ox age if you were meant to be
[1:45:35] there he would have done it he placed
[1:45:37] you here because you were meant to be in
[1:45:39] this age and he knew what age you
[1:45:40] belonged in so he began to call you out
[1:45:43] and place you in the eagle age oh that's
[1:45:47] where we're at this morning it's Eagle
[1:45:49] time it's revealing time it's calling up
[1:45:52] high
[1:45:54] time oh I love it I think that's one of
[1:45:57] the greatest examples of an exodus I can
[1:45:59] think of is when that little
[1:46:02] Eagle amen because a
[1:46:05] farmer was raising chickens but he was
[1:46:07] shorten egg and so he took that eagle
[1:46:10] egg and placed it in that Nest oh and it
[1:46:13] began to it began to be built under a
[1:46:15] chicken atmosphere and it was born one
[1:46:18] day but there was something about it
[1:46:21] that didn't never fit in
[1:46:23] brother Bram said a Son of God can go a
[1:46:26] long time before he recognizes he's a
[1:46:28] son Amen brother Bram said in fact a lot
[1:46:31] of true Christians are like the story of
[1:46:32] that baby baby eagle that was hatched
[1:46:34] under a hand you can go a long time
[1:46:38] before recognizing your son am mean but
[1:46:41] there that eagle was it knew it didn't
[1:46:43] fit in it tried for a season to dwell
[1:46:45] amongst those chickens but it never fit
[1:46:47] in it never belonged and so one day when
[1:46:50] mother Eagle begins to Circle that old
[1:46:52] Barnyard and it begins to cry out that
[1:46:55] eagle scream there's something in that
[1:46:58] eagle that begins to say whoa that
[1:47:00] sounds familiar that sounds like my
[1:47:03] language that sounds like home and mean
[1:47:06] because it spoke the same language
[1:47:08] that's why when this message began to
[1:47:10] call you you understood it because it
[1:47:12] was Eagle to Eagle it spoke your
[1:47:15] language it was calling your name and
[1:47:17] mean because you may have spent years in
[1:47:19] the chicken yard not knowing you were a
[1:47:22] son but when this message begin to call
[1:47:24] your name it begin to reveal to you that
[1:47:26] you always were a son that you always
[1:47:29] were an eagle that you never belonged in
[1:47:31] the chicken yard but something was
[1:47:33] calling you higher and me because this
[1:47:35] message will call you higher friends and
[1:47:38] me sometimes you might feel like it's
[1:47:39] preaching above you and you're never
[1:47:41] going to reach it but that's because
[1:47:43] it's an eagle message and it's only
[1:47:45] calling you higher so sometimes it'll
[1:47:48] preach above you and me but don't feel
[1:47:50] condemned just say Lord I want to get up
[1:47:53] there amen where the preacher's
[1:47:54] preaching and I feel a Tug come up
[1:47:56] higher oh and that eagle started with a
[1:47:59] flap you know the sky might have looked
[1:48:01] a long ways away but he started with
[1:48:03] just a little flap and sometimes that's
[1:48:06] all you do that you just start with a
[1:48:08] little move towards God and Me Maybe all
[1:48:10] you can do is raise your hand me but
[1:48:12] it's a move towards
[1:48:14] God how did the T how did the children
[1:48:17] of Israel get out of Egypt it started
[1:48:20] with a step and me that the same step
[1:48:22] that took them amen from Egypt Into the
[1:48:25] Wilderness could take him into the
[1:48:26] promised land but it started with a step
[1:48:29] amen sometimes you just got to take a
[1:48:31] step and me sometimes you you feel like
[1:48:33] you're never going to reach it but you
[1:48:35] just take another step and before you
[1:48:37] know it you'll be a lot longer down the
[1:48:39] road than you were a few months ago or a
[1:48:41] few years ago oh and that eagle am me it
[1:48:45] jumped up on that barnyard post and mean
[1:48:48] it wasn't high enough it wasn't where he
[1:48:51] belonged but maybe it was higher than
[1:48:53] he'd ever been before and mean for the
[1:48:55] first time in his life he's beginning to
[1:48:58] realize this old chicken yard that I've
[1:49:00] been pending for my whole life it's not
[1:49:03] going to hold me forever and he began to
[1:49:05] realize that those man-made cages would
[1:49:08] not hold him oh I like what a prophet
[1:49:11] said he said you can't organize
[1:49:12] Pentecost you can't denominate Pentecost
[1:49:15] is an experience not an organization he
[1:49:18] said it's for you methodists you
[1:49:19] Baptists and Presbyterians he said they
[1:49:21] try to draw offences is around it but
[1:49:24] it's not so Eagles will fly right over
[1:49:26] it sure they do oh Friends when the
[1:49:30] prophet begin to teach us that this
[1:49:32] message can't be denominated now I
[1:49:35] understand why because it's an eagle
[1:49:37] message and every time a man-made
[1:49:40] chicken or a man-made farmer tries to a
[1:49:43] me put fences around this message it
[1:49:45] just flies right over the fence and me
[1:49:47] because the same message that brother
[1:49:49] Brandon preached 60 years ago is still
[1:49:52] alive and well amen because it just
[1:49:55] keeps flying over every man-made fence
[1:49:58] over every man-made Creed trying to say
[1:49:59] the days of Miracles are passed trying
[1:50:02] to say God don't do those things no more
[1:50:04] trying to say he don't pour out the Holy
[1:50:06] Spirit no more am me well do you have
[1:50:08] the Holy Spirit I mean why because this
[1:50:10] message can't be denominated but it flew
[1:50:13] over the fence oh and you're Eagles
[1:50:16] aren't you how many Eagles are here this
[1:50:18] morning and me and Satan's try to fence
[1:50:21] you up and try to limit you Amen to a
[1:50:24] certain experience and try to hold you
[1:50:26] down in an oppressive life a life of
[1:50:29] depression and a life of anxiety but
[1:50:31] your Eagles oh and you just fly over the
[1:50:35] fence anden Mama chicken started to tell
[1:50:37] you that and me you're never going to
[1:50:39] make it and Me Mama chick and try to say
[1:50:41] you can't you can't you can't you can't
[1:50:45] oh but I can't didn't belong in the
[1:50:47] eagle dictionary and mean I can't might
[1:50:49] have worked for those chickens but when
[1:50:51] that eagle re realized who it was it be
[1:50:54] to say I can I can I can I can I can I
[1:50:59] can I can make it I can be healed I can
[1:51:03] be delivered I can go in a Rapture I can
[1:51:05] understand the word for my day because
[1:51:07] I'm an eagle I can I can I can and me
[1:51:11] because it's who I am oh but when that
[1:51:14] mother Eagle begin to sound it begin to
[1:51:17] sound forth a voice letting that eagle
[1:51:21] know I don't belong here I don't belong
[1:51:25] here I don't belong in this chicken yard
[1:51:28] I hear something and for the first time
[1:51:30] in my life it's beginning to make sense
[1:51:32] why I've always felt this way I don't
[1:51:34] belong here you see Moses was raised up
[1:51:38] under pharaoh and he spent a season in
[1:51:40] the Palace of pharaoh but one day God
[1:51:43] called him out because he never belonged
[1:51:45] in Pharaoh's Palace and you might have
[1:51:47] been raised up under organization you
[1:51:49] might have been raised up under
[1:51:51] depression you might might have been
[1:51:52] raised up under a complex raised up
[1:51:55] under a fear amen but God there comes a
[1:51:57] calling out time in your life amen where
[1:52:00] that voice begins to say you might have
[1:52:02] been raised up there but you don't
[1:52:03] belong there I mean you might be there
[1:52:05] but you don't belong there that's not
[1:52:07] your identity and then God may have
[1:52:09] allowed you to go through it for a
[1:52:11] season and brother comes a calling out
[1:52:13] time saying come out my children come
[1:52:16] out of the fear come out of the worry
[1:52:19] and me come out of the heaviness come
[1:52:21] out of the darkness come out of lay the
[1:52:23] sea and come up into Heavenly places
[1:52:26] with Christ anden come up into the
[1:52:28] atmospheres where all things are
[1:52:30] possible God is preparing a people to
[1:52:33] believe all things you see Exodus 1:1
[1:52:36] said that the children of Israel came
[1:52:39] into Egypt oh before we start this book
[1:52:42] of Exodus and me before we bring out
[1:52:44] this whole book the very first verse is
[1:52:46] telling you amen that these were not
[1:52:48] called the children of Egypt they were
[1:52:51] called the children of Israel and they
[1:52:53] only came into Egypt but they didn't
[1:52:55] belong in Egypt oh that's letting you
[1:52:58] know that a mean you are not identified
[1:53:00] with what you're going through you may
[1:53:02] be going through Egypt but you are
[1:53:04] children of Israel oh and you may be
[1:53:07] going through depression you may be
[1:53:09] going through the symptoms of this world
[1:53:10] but you're a child of God and he's
[1:53:13] saying you don't belong there come out
[1:53:15] of her my people come out of it and come
[1:53:17] up come up higher come up into the
[1:53:20] heavenlies come up into the ATM fears
[1:53:22] where all things are possible oh lay
[1:53:25] aside every weight lay aside every sin
[1:53:28] which does so easily beset you and run
[1:53:30] this race with amen patience press
[1:53:33] towards the High Calling brother brandom
[1:53:36] said you can't look backward and move
[1:53:38] forward at the same time you've got to
[1:53:40] forget those things which are behind to
[1:53:42] press into this High Calling and if
[1:53:44] you're Looking Backward at the mistakes
[1:53:46] you've made 10 years ago it's time to
[1:53:48] forget those things which are behind and
[1:53:51] press towards a high call calling all
[1:53:53] the church has built upon High Ambitions
[1:53:56] and if there's still a deep calling in
[1:53:58] your heart for more of God there's a
[1:54:00] deep to respond this morning there's
[1:54:02] more of God to be had and mean you may
[1:54:04] be justified but you can be Sanctified
[1:54:07] you can be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:54:09] you can be
[1:54:11] adopted you see those children of Israel
[1:54:13] were going through that desert and
[1:54:16] Joshua had a command him we're going to
[1:54:19] pass by Esau's Mountain
[1:54:22] but that's not your inheritance that's
[1:54:25] he's saying we're going to pass by them
[1:54:27] and they were not ordained to go where
[1:54:30] you're going he said your inheritance
[1:54:32] lays beyond the Jordan your inheritance
[1:54:35] lays in Jacob's Mountain he said don't
[1:54:38] fuss with them don't Ste with them how
[1:54:40] can we make all the Lutheran see it how
[1:54:43] can we make them see it but oh to you to
[1:54:46] you who have a deep calling to the Deep
[1:54:49] to you where amen just to settle down
[1:54:51] and amen just raising sheep is not
[1:54:53] enough for you and mean you're here for
[1:54:55] more than to be a mechanic you're here
[1:54:57] for more am mean this to be an
[1:54:59] electrician or just to work on a
[1:55:02] computer oh you were here to manifest
[1:55:06] the word for your day to be a Son of God
[1:55:10] in the image of God you were created for
[1:55:12] more and if there's a deep calling in
[1:55:14] the deep and mean there's a deep to
[1:55:16] respond and say Lord we want to see
[1:55:18] healing today and Lord tomorrow we want
[1:55:20] to see missing limbs restored Lord and
[1:55:22] the next day we want to see our loved
[1:55:24] ones amongst us Lord I'm not going to
[1:55:26] stop I'm built upon High Ambitions
[1:55:28] because I'm an eagle oh and you begin to
[1:55:31] Fly Above the chatter chatter of the
[1:55:33] world that old voice just trying to hold
[1:55:36] you down those old voices of of complex
[1:55:39] and fears trying to hold you down oh but
[1:55:41] you realize I don't have to live with
[1:55:43] this devil's voice amen but you begin to
[1:55:46] Flap those wings and set your wings to
[1:55:49] The Winds of the word of God and those
[1:55:52] winds are not up and down you don't flop
[1:55:55] up one day and down the next but when
[1:55:57] you really learn to set your wings if
[1:55:59] you do flop it doesn't mean you're not
[1:56:01] an eagle but there's different phases
[1:56:04] that eagle begins to mature he begins to
[1:56:07] learn how to set his wings oh and all of
[1:56:10] a sudden that little flopping anden you
[1:56:12] you see them sometimes and I don't have
[1:56:15] any problem with that at all but
[1:56:17] sometimes you see him come to the altar
[1:56:18] time after time again and and I I say
[1:56:21] come come on on keep coming but oh how
[1:56:24] we love to see that stability come into
[1:56:28] a life and all a sudden oh they begin to
[1:56:32] recognize I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:56:35] daughter of God and they begin to set
[1:56:37] their
[1:56:38] wings oh and they begin to soar up into
[1:56:42] those atmospheres where all things are
[1:56:44] possible and they might fall down again
[1:56:48] oh maybe they'll come a time oh they
[1:56:50] need to get back to that Altar and
[1:56:52] rededicate and get their eyes cleaned
[1:56:54] again maybe there come a time where they
[1:56:56] need to get back down oh they get in
[1:56:58] that Valley and they begin to come
[1:57:00] through those phases but oh just a few
[1:57:02] short days and because they're an eagle
[1:57:05] they'll be back up in that Heavenly
[1:57:07] because that's where they
[1:57:09] belong and when you belong in your
[1:57:12] position as a son or daughter of God
[1:57:14] that's where you belong and if you're
[1:57:16] not there you'll never be satisfied
[1:57:18] that's right you'll never be satisfied
[1:57:20] with just a halfway life you'll never be
[1:57:22] satisfied if God's calling you to preach
[1:57:25] God's calling you to sing God's calling
[1:57:27] you to be a Son of God or daughter of
[1:57:28] God then you'll never be satisfied until
[1:57:32] you reach that calling and you begin to
[1:57:34] surrender to what he's calling you to
[1:57:37] and me you be you fighting with it
[1:57:38] you're fussing with it you're saying
[1:57:39] Lord I don't want to do it I I don't
[1:57:41] want to give up this I don't want to
[1:57:42] give up that I don't want to do that
[1:57:44] Lord oh but he begins to break that
[1:57:46] wheel and he begins to stir that
[1:57:49] Nest he says no if you're not going to
[1:57:52] go on your own I'll stir the nest
[1:57:53] because I will not leave you here you
[1:57:55] belong in the skies you belong in that
[1:57:58] position I will not let you stay here
[1:58:00] I'll stir the nest if I have to I'll
[1:58:02] kick you out and let you have a test
[1:58:04] fall if I have to oh but if you fall
[1:58:07] I'll catch you on my wings I'll bear you
[1:58:10] up again I'll not let you stay there am
[1:58:13] me because you're a heaven born bird
[1:58:15] anden and the eagle isn't just born up
[1:58:17] high but it belongs in the skies and
[1:58:20] mean you see it was heaven born and it's
[1:58:23] heavenbound because it's an eagle and so
[1:58:26] if the eagle finds itself down in the
[1:58:28] trial am mean that's not where he came
[1:58:30] from and that's not where he's going
[1:58:33] it's just the season that he's found
[1:58:35] himself in and oh you might be going
[1:58:37] through a hard week or a hard season but
[1:58:40] it's the hardest it's it's the lowest
[1:58:43] you can get friends if you're an eagle
[1:58:46] this hard season you're going through
[1:58:48] it's the lowest you can get because you
[1:58:50] came from God and you're going back back
[1:58:52] to God and this little chicken yard
[1:58:54] experience that you might be in it's
[1:58:57] just a season oh but it's the lowest you
[1:58:59] can go hallu he's calling you up and can
[1:59:04] we stand to our feet this morning yes he
[1:59:08] is I believe it's time for the church to
[1:59:11] come up
[1:59:12] higher oh come into those
[1:59:16] atmospheres all the move is on for the
[1:59:18] bride the prophet would say thus sayith
[1:59:20] the Lord to those of you who really
[1:59:22] believe this he said we're entering
[1:59:23] another age we're entering the raptured
[1:59:27] age oh because Le to seea we might be in
[1:59:30] it but we're not of it that's not where
[1:59:32] your soul
[1:59:33] belongs your soul is not meant to be in
[1:59:36] the spirit of the L to see and age be
[1:59:38] lukewarm formal and Powerless that's not
[1:59:41] the spirit you want to get into you want
[1:59:43] to get in the spirit of an eagle
[1:59:46] age oh he's not just your Exodus he's
[1:59:50] your door
[1:59:52] that open door where he's saying come up
[1:59:55] out of her my people and come up higher
[1:59:58] come into Heavenly
[2:00:00] places he's your Exodus it's more than a
[2:00:04] book friends it's a person a and that
[2:00:07] person is here this morning he's your
[2:00:08] Exodus from sickness to health he's your
[2:00:11] Exodus from bondage to
[2:00:13] Liberty he's your Exodus and if he's
[2:00:16] calling you out he's got somewhere to
[2:00:19] take
[2:00:20] you oh time to get into the vision time
[2:00:24] to let this message become your
[2:00:27] vision time to get in the vision and
[2:00:29] start
[2:00:30] walking oh start

[2:00:35] breath he said it's more than three
[2:00:36] minutes I mean less than three minutes s
[2:00:38] say less than it's three minutes for the
[2:00:40] earth to be blowed up in time less than
[2:00:41] that he said the next breath of Jehovah
[2:00:44] is come out of it my people come up

[2:00:59] purpose to prepare a people give them a
[2:01:02] Heavenly atmosphere a desire to come up

[2:01:13] been come up higher do you have that
[2:01:16] desire this
[2:01:17] morning Lord I want to come up higher

[2:01:23] chatter I'm tired of that Old Devil
[2:01:25] whispering in my ear but you know what
[2:01:28] if you just set your wings to the
[2:01:30] infallible word of
[2:01:33] God oh that chicken can't follow you

[2:01:45] that Red Sea Satan cannot follow you
[2:01:48] where you're going church oh he cannot
[2:01:50] go because if if he wanted to follow you
[2:01:53] where you're going he'd have to get
[2:01:54] under that blood and receive the Holy
[2:01:56] Ghost and then he'd be your brother amen
[2:01:58] you might feel him now and mean you
[2:02:00] might be going through your weeks and
[2:02:02] you feel that old tempter amen but he
[2:02:04] can only follow you so long oh but one
[2:02:07] of these days he'll be left here and
