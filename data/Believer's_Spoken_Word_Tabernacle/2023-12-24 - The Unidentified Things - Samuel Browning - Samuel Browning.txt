and amen be gathered together I know we had um we do have many that uh are traveling and certainly just ask the Lord just be merciful with them to them and others that maybe are not feeling well and we want to continue to remember Sister Ruth Hoyer in prayer the Lord will just continue to move for our sister in a special way and uh just like we hear we heard here with um the testimony there of sister Judith that she gave Lord um you know I remember there's been times and there's Witnesses standing in the congregation where there's things that you could look at by a report and say well you know the doctors were just guessing on that and they got that wrong right I mean you can chw you can choose that but doctors have seen things many times oh yes and they're trained to Go by sight and what you tell them that's right that's that's how their training is and so when they make that that declaration and then to see how God has moved on the scene for that to dismiss that there's any cancer there there's another situation sitting right here in this congregation sister Amanda one time went in for they had called her they G they gave a scan and you remember this where I had to I called and I went over there and met you and brother Aaron over there in in Lakewood from here we met over there now the difference here it showed on one scan this one thing it showed it right but after they did another test when we got over there nothing that's right yes sir so to me it's [Applause] God I'm a witness I've seen him do you have to You' seen him do the miraculous and in every every part of healing no matter what aspect it comes it's miraculous but I think just in times like that that even in reports we can say oh that was just maybe the mistake or no no that was just the Lord his Mercy amen that's what it was and I i' always want to be found giving him glory for that cuz he's worthy yes sir amen amen certainly we are so grateful for that so I I say that in Remembering sister Ruth hoer in prayer I I know there's others around the world that are dealing with cancer I didn't uh get a chance a few weeks back brother Paul Le Fontaine had had text me uh right after after they had got the the news with sister Sharon Van wink and she's completely cancer free wow so and uh that was that was from a few weeks back when they came out of the doctor so we we thank the Lord for his Mercy I I text Brother Paul back I said I feel a song coming I said every Psalm and every song comes from experience oh yes it does I told him I said I just can't wait to hear the one that comes out of this one y I said cuz she's already been singing it all these months amen so we just thank the Lord for thaten so glad to have uh I think is sister Michelle is it Denise am I am I right what what is your name Sierra Sierra did I got I get that nice to have you with us amen God bless you she serves there in our Armed Forces right in the Navy so we want to say thank you for your service thank you real quick couple announcements here before we jump right into the the word of the Lord this morning just remember um the email we sent out in the announcement on Thursday of the event on December 30th that brother joshu is hosting uh it's there just to kind of have a time to be able to kind of informally um you know meet and I sister Sharon I I want to say I just so appreciate as I've watched U different ones even my brother-in-law he he took a stab at it he he he came and greeted her in French now you know sometimes when you you all know how it is I'm speaking to Spanish people or they're Puerto Rican or Mexican sometimes you you get individuals that they come and greet you and you're like this is a this is an English tur trying to speak Spanish you know it's like it's like trying to give me uh generic inside of the actual Mountain Dew can but we appreciate that those things me mean so much uh I think of even when uh when John F Kennedy stood there when he greeted at the Germans when he stood on that wall his first words were in German y that's an icebreaker there something about it you I say well what what would that mean this that that's just kind of carnal well the scripture calls our name and the prophet tells us from Revelations 1 he said there's nothing more precious than someone to hear their name being called oh yeah so when it's something that it shows a little bit that you know uh to take that little bit of initiative but I want to say thank you I know for sister Sharon and and making her feel welcome what a transition she's she's had and I told her I said just hang on there's snow coming she said it's cold I said uh not yet not yet not yet but at least we're not like Canada true that's true in many ways no but really in the cold I my I I just in the cold that that part of it I it's beyond me that that part in Canada but anyhow I we just love you and I want to remember that signup sheet is out there if you planning on going the cut off day where brother joshu way has to have that in order to know how much food to order is December 30th well that's when the date is that's the time or the date December 30th sorry the cut off is December 28th this Thursday so um just please if you have any questions his number is on the page as well as the email that you've received if you didn't receive the email find somebody else here maybe they can get it to you any the information it's also on that sheet also brother on Thursday brother Alexander mulus will be standing in here for us Lord willing uh myself and Paul and Ben will be going up to the winter youth retreat uh have to minister there on Wednesday evening and Thursday evening and I certainly cover your prayers absolutely I really cover your prayers I try to give update every time that I come back because there's things that I want you to understand that you know from me that this is home I'm a home body I know some people like traveling that's not me that's not me I don't I don't I like being home and it's not just being home there's just things you want to just continue to labor in but try to bring reports back so that you see it's your prayers that's laboring right there with it right Amen in I don't know if I got a chance to mention this to you or not but as we stood there in the beginning of November up at uh brother John Andes and we were ministering there the very first service uh is it your is it your cousin Debbie Debbie your cousin so Debbie her cousin who sister Carper uh helped to raise her they were there in those meeting ings and she was there with her husband on that first night when we came out the first thing that he said was he said that was exactly what I needed now I've never met him before that's good and we stood there and we talked and I just tried to just you know just being sensitive I wasn't just just talking just to him just to talk to him and just talk with him and the Holy Spirit service after service and on that Saturday night the Lord took us and we begin to speak on the thoughts of God and I never forget I stood there and and you see both of them standing in the service with their hands up in the air yes and he took a hold of her hand at the end of the service he said will you go with me he said I want to surrender my life to the Lord hallelujah yes sir and I I just want to say that that's your prayers that's your prayers yes it is if there wasn't anything else that came out of that meeting there there was many healings and sometimes there's things that we don't see right then and there but I I just want you to know that that's the effect of your prayers you're a part of it God's God's chose there's times where God lays on heart for me to go here or there you're a part of that you're not you're not excluded you're a part of that and I want you to understand that your prayers mean a lot when I can think back to it when in the midst of those battles and sometimes it's it it's a battle in the midst of that moment Satan is fighting and battling but I think back on on it and I know there's people praying for me I got different ones of you at different times you might think well I don't want to bother brother Samuel with the text but I've had different ones at different times send me a text say I'm praying for you it means a lot it means so much to me it's like a charge that comes in and I mean that some Sunday so we'll be back here I'll be back here I've have brother Steve Carle coming in on Sunday and I thought that would be good for New Year's Eve and uh so I I thought for myself I thought you know I I just would like to sit uh and uh get a couple times to do that through the year but I just would like to sit and enjoy that with Brother Steve and I understood that he he he stopped he stopped brother Brian down there and he said why is it he says brother Samuels he not want to be there when I'm there or something no I just have I have I have confidence and he knows that I have have confidence and I so appreciate when I see the people of God being edified well that does my heart so good that just does my heart good you know so I I'm sorry I I just love talking to you you're not going to count this against me are you I'll change I'll change I'll change my timer here but I want to say sister Anna welcome back God bless you amen and I I'll do that right now change my timer could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord I I think to the scripture this is how I feel in my heart Happy is the people whose God is the Lord Lord we go on in another place and say happy is the people whose God is the god of Jacob you could have said of Israel but you chose to let us know that Lord no matter the conditions you are still the almighty God lord it was Israel that lived out through the Flesh of Jacob father we find that same reality in our own Hearts we love you Lord you intended for us to be happy yeah and Lord well you said in your word and we've experienced that you've given us a joy that the world could never give not like that of the world which can be up and down and depending on how the stocks are in the news but no it's a joy that remains consistent that even that we in times of trial and when we could become weary in our spirit there is a joy within that can never be taken away from us Lord and that's the joy that we know that we have found him and he has found us Lord no matter what comes or go goes this is our joy the joy of the Lord is our strength we love you this morning we just want you to know that Lord we appreciate you Lord I ask this morning that you would just move Lord for every need we mention Lord sister Ruth and I also want to remember brother Monaco Lord God you know the need for he and his wife Lord Lord Jesus there's distance and Miles well that's nothing to you Lord we just simply stand as Believers Lord that would offer up a sacrifice we would ask that Lord that you would go to our brother may the same holy spirit that in the beginning Lord when the word was spoken you went out and you begin to brood upon the Earth Lord and to bring forth I pray that God May that same Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord may you move Lord upon brother mono's body right now may you Lord God encourage him Lord for just a word from you lord lord just one word Lord oh God breaks every bit of weariness every bit of Despair for we know that in this body we're not beyond that but we have one who as David said is the saving strength of his anointed now Lord may you strengthen our brother Lord and his wife lordu may you move for their needs Lord right now God for sister Ruth Lord for brother Ron Spencer Lord for each one Lord that Lord dealing and facing Lord cancer I pray that God that you would continue to move on their behalf Lord how we long Lord to hear that report rung out Lord no more it's free Lord we thank you for touching sister Sharon sister Sharon Van wink Lord we thank you for that thank you for moving for sister Judith the Lord oh God how thankful we are thankful to be here Lord I Thank you Lord for moving Lord for brother Bobby and sister Michelle thank you Lord for your mercies Lord thank we just want to say Lord we love you we love you may you guide us in your word now Lord I I just give myself to you that may you take full control control in this service in Jesus name amen and amen amen I want to go to Micah um I believe it's chapter five and um Micah CH 5 and verse 2 just one verse of scripture from here and uh I actually was going to thought I was going to go to a different way is what I had projected is to go and take a different portion out of the scripture but the Holy Spirit just seemed to continue to press on just another part in it so maybe we'll get the next part next year you can preach at any time of the year that's right uh it does doesn't matter any time of the year Micah 5 verse two but thou Bethlehem ephata though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel Lord whose goings forth have been from old and from Everlasting so good amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I apologize to you that we even though I have all the slides and everything prepared but uh there was a little breakdown there with um you know how with technology it wasn't so much the technology but it's with uh when things um are to be come do and things like that and brother Brian just I was texting him today I said hey I I'm not able to shoot my notes over there and he said ah he went in and looked at it ah we got to update the the the the the credit card information so maybe that's just uh maybe that's just sparing us but um I pray that God will just help me I always pray this as Lord will help me just communicate and get out of the way the thought that he wants to say and that he'll just have Liberty to take it to our hearts just how it needs to be amen so um I just thinking of this from the portion here and I couldn't get away from that thought from the little things and I want to just speak here on a title on the unidentified things the unidentified things I want you to listen how brother Bram takes this and why little Bethlehem he says when we think of how God does things in unusual ways because he is unusual himself God is unusual he's the supernatural the finite unto we who are finite so anything he does is in its scope unusual and God is so great till he takes the unidentified things of the earth to identify himself by it so God takes the unidentified things right of the earth to identify himself by it now think about this in the scriptures in 1 Corinthians chap 1 verse 25 it says because the foolishness of God is wiser than man and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many Mighty not many noble are called now Paul didn't say there wasn't any that was mighty that he just said there were very few this is why even when Jesus would say it it's easier for the camel to go through the eye of the needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven that's good he didn't say it was impossible but he's liking it to where that eye of a needle is where one packing Goods with a camel they would have to unpack that Camel all the goods off of it and that Camel would have to get down on its knees and they would have to guide it through that little place in the wall that's good so it's very very few that will humble themselves because they're trusting in their riches now I just say it like this you you know a person might be the poorest person there could be maybe they're not poor maybe they're mediocre or whatever it would be but you know whatever it comes down to that if we can really see God for who he is and what he's done for us and when we think of this in the time of a Christmas season Paul mentioned it already we recognize he he wasn't a lamb wasn't Lambs are not born in this time but yet we take the opportunity the world does all of their things but we take the opportunity to announce what this is really all about that we who were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies but God himself knowing knowing we there was a way back we needed a way back that's right we needed saving amen we needed delivering and no man was able to save himself no man was able to deliver himself but God the only way it could come is by God himself self becoming one of us and I want you to think of this and just even in these simplest terms God came and he made himself known down through the scriptures he would come to Abraham and he would make himself known to Abraham there reveal himself as mdic the great king and priest of the most high God yeah then he would make him then he would once again come before Abraham in Genesis 18 and he would reveal himself knowing it was it was more than a man that was standing before the tent door of Abraham because then even where when Sarah would laugh in her heart the Bible said that he could stand there and say why did Sarah laugh in her heart and he would call her Sarah he didn't have to ask Abraham what's her name so here God had come down and had shown and actually in that part of it God was making known even a type of how that God himself would come in visitation in the last days as he promised before the Gentiles days are finished is that right when Jesus said Abraham saw my day Jesus here standing here Abraham saw my day and he rejoiced to see it what did Abraham saw what did he see he saw God in flesh before him that's that's God's day that's light that's this is where when we understand this of how that when we come back to a place of a question I'd like to just pose and to and to drop to you and maybe we'll pick it up here in a moment but to understand why was it so emphatic in the scripture where it says Behold a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a child bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel this being interpreted God With Us why would it have to be a virgin why would it have to be a babe that was born why couldn't God step down as he had at other times and just made himself known as he did to Abraham and on through the scriptures in many different ways the purpose of this was for Redemption hallu because there had been a fall take place in Eden but now God notied not taking anything of the woman but God created not only that of the egg but sperm also it was God who created his own body to come and dwell in true it could not be blood that was already here it had to be innocent blood yeah it had to be one who would come and live as you and I live live under all the Temptations live under all of those things in order to be able to stand there and be declared as pilot and as Herod Herod could say I find no fault in him he was the perfect Lamb of God all testified of it right the Bible said tempted in all points yet without sin and he went and he paid the price for you and I shed his blood that then through that price that Ransom being paid that then he calls to us come a liberty that you and I might come to a full reality in him to a to a real to what what an longing that would be within the heart of an individual a longing that would satisfy all that they have been searching for see God made man to thirst many times how the enemy will try to satisfy that thirst with many things even thirst of things that are are permissible but yet how Satan wants to get in and pervert them in so many different ways but God is the satisfier when when a man or woman when a person meets God and they really meet God in the in that reality of who he is what he has done for them it brings a satisfaction to their life there is a there is a satisfaction Oh I thought something was going off here I usually don't have my phone up here anymore but sometimes you know you get those weather alerts that's not what it was uh the enemy just want to distract me I'll mill on a different pathway we'll get there but the ultimate is what God desired to do for you and I and I want you to think of this in verse 27 but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God Chosen and the things which are not unidentified to bring to not those things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence you know something that's identified it it simply means it's not recognized or it's not identified it's not known very interesting even as I hear the prophet take this and then I begin to go back and just looking over this when God divided think of this for a moment when God divided the inheritance among the children of Israel remember that every one of those 12 Patriarchs when they were being born the inspiration of the Holy Spirit would move upon them and they would utter out the name of that child that was being born and within that name held the mystery of their position in the promised land now God God remember when Israel went into bondage now God came to bring them out of Egypt and to bring them back into their promised land and when they came there he lets Joshua know you are called called to divide to the children of Israel their inheritance but Joshua was going to have to come under the same inspiration let me say it like this the inspiration of the Original Seed it would have to be the original inspiration he would have to enter into that channel that moved down upon those mothers and when Joshua would speak then here you find that this tribe would receive all the villages towns cities provinces that pertain to them that's so but in Joshua chapter 15 where it speaks of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah Bethlehem is of Judah but there's not one mention of Bethlehem in that chapter that's right now you say why would God do that why would God purposely do that because at that time it was not a significant a significant place but God chooses listen to me now that's God's ways God chooses to hide himself in the things right right in the midst under the nose and right there even in his own word hallelu think about it what has been stumbled at and staggered at for years it was lost the mystery of the baptism Hallelujah of water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ men could look at it sure we had those that broke into the Trinity which is titles that's title is not a name then we had those that broke over into the Oneness and that's not correct either it's not it's not if it's not even correct just to say just Jesus because there's many many of you know that here especially from different cultures and things like that there would be many of name Jesus or Jesus right it's very common outside of a lot of times our our culture and everything else but you see this is where that Peter said he hath made the same Jesus both Lord and Christ and other words this is almighty God come down in Redemption that's so good and Jesus said I have power to may lay my life down and power to take it up again no man had ever been able to declare that before that's right but he had within him that same power that was residing in there who was it it was none other than almighty God walking right here among us Emmanuel a place this this to me just so struck me it it really just really sent me in a and just um just I I don't know I would really just went off in those trajectories with that cuz we could really preach this but I want to just stay within that confines of how if you'll notice many of us have heard this statement before you know you drive into a town or a city and uh I remember when we would when we lived in sanduski you would enter in there when you come into the city limits they would say Corporation limits and they would have a sign and that sign many times some of those different signs would say uh so and so won the State title I remember for sanduski so and so won the State title in a wrestling way back win and so forth and there was always certain things about it now you know they've got it from when and sanduski it's uh uh you know they a lot of things you know Orlando oace played here and they've got streets named after and everything else you know so what I'm just trying to say we've heard the phrase uh boy they put that place on the map now nobody listen to me nobody and I don't know who you would who draws out of Lorraine or Sheffield or what I'm sorry I haven't maybe maybe they don't have maybe there's no I know there's people that's come out out of here but you no understand what I'm saying that sometimes when there there's a part of it that you know many times when people want to know where are you at where uh the church where is Sheffield exactly at and I'll say Cleveland no I'll say Cleveland I do that's an easy checkpoint cuz if I say lorine many people don't know they don't they don't they can't relate to that if I don't say Cleveland if I say Cleveland they say well you know Cleveland I don't have to many to do that but sometimes you know I'll say Hey you know especially if young people I say you know where sanduski at you know you ever heard of Cedar Point you ever heard of Cedar Point they'll say yeah yeah I heard of that well okay so here's where we're at in proximity you see it's something that gives you a point of reference and so you've heard that phrase we've heard that phrase man that put that city on the map or that put that town on the map or that put that place on the map I want to just say it like this when we notice that within this how that Bethlehem was not even mentioned in the inheritance of Judah but it was there the whole time and here think of this think of it of even how that Micah under inspiration as a prophet of God would utter these things and announc this in that time of where the Messiah was to be born even even when they came there remember the Wise Men followed that star for a period of years we understand it's not like the nativity scenes we see with wise men here and Shepherds those are two different events you recognize when the when the wise men arrived there finally as they made their way the Bible said there was the child with his mother not baby and furthermore when they returned knowing that Herod intended evil Herod had already asked them when did you first see this star he would know the time frame this is why the Bible said after that that Herod when he seen he was mocked of the wise men sent and he gave orders Slaughter all of those from two years old and down wow see these these things in the scriptures are unidentified things but once the Holy Spirit identifies them we we see the repacement of them oh now I see that it's the same thing as we were saying with water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ once that has been revealed and we know the prophet said you really don't need a revelation for that cuz it's written in the word and we know in this age of great oh intelligence and intellect and wisdom and and wisdom and all but you know the Bible says that God he Delights in bringing the wisdom of man to not and it's what man calls great God calls foolish man at one time made a ship and they announced it's Unsinkable and no doubt it was a very well-made ship but God let us let it be known there is nothing that is certain outside of the word of God once again nothing there is no place of safety outside of Jesus Christ there's no bomb shelter there's nothing that is more safe than abiding under the shadow of the almighty God and at one time this nation Abode under it but it's rejected it true it rejected her day of visitation but I want you to think of it in this way this place here if it became founded by a man named salmone salmone marries you could look in Ruth you can look in the beginning of Matthew chapter 1 salmone marries Rahab now I want you to remember who Rahab is the Bible tells us it'll it'll even include it in Hebrews 11 Rahab the Harlot why would it also include that in there in Hebrews 11 if she had already been forgiven given been delivered of that kind of a lifestyle God would include that in there for you and I that you and I could see the depth of God's grace and to know there's no situation Beyond Redemption Hallelujah and here was Rahab in a city called Jericho in line of judgment but she heard she began to hear the acts of God right she was an unidentified daughter of God but the word of God begin to come and begin to stir up that which was unidentified hallah a word where God was identifying himself that he's the same God he's the Living God he's the god that keeps his word it begin to move in her heart to where when she Reed these two spies into her dwelling place and she received a word right of Deliverance she received a word that brought an identification to her life she was unidentified perhaps you and I can relate to that wandering about through this world bumping into this bumping into that trying to fit in here trying to satisfy there trying you see there's a longing there's a part unidentified but only God can identify the unidentified ifed part it takes qu to bring that forth something that seems so small and so insignificant but yet God himself would bring that together I'm not going to be much longer but to think of how that I like how brother Brandon place he says when Salmon moved in there he said no doubt it might have just been maybe couple houses couple places this is what I'm this is what to me it just draws upon my heart of how that Simone and Rahab come into this place of Bethlehem a place that is not even known but when there has come a uniting between salmone and Rahab then everything right in there it starts to prosper as they come into their position let me say this to you there's only one way for the word to become in power there's only one way for the word to move move and to grow and to become what God intended for it to be and that's to be United with Jesus Christ in a born again experience and come into Bethlehem Hallelujah a place that might seem so insignificant unidentified but yet it's God's ordained place for your life to flourish yes it is prise the Lord though thou be little that scripture we read in the opening though thou be little in the New Testament it says the least among the princes same meaning little the word little here means insignificant young small in other words something that can be overlooked I want to remind you when Samuel was ordained by God to go and to choose a king for the Lord now listen to my words when he was ordained by God to choose a king for the Lord you see some years prior to that the people wanted a king they wanted a king that would fit their stature and they chose a man who was Head and Shoulder Above the Rest that's good and when they first chose Saul this was Saul's response who am I I'm the least my family is the least even Among The Tribe of Benjamin not only am I the least in my family but my family's the least if he would have only kept that attitude if he only would have kept that he'd have been all right but when Saul be to feel like he had authority to to do this he could do this well if this one working right God understands I'll just offer this up for Samuel he had you see what happened he failed to respect simple obedience to the word amen and you and I will get off track shes the world when you begin to make excuses or reasoning for simple obedience to the word that's already been written that's you see that word is already written it's not unidentified there is identified scriptures right before us we know we're living in a time in an hour where there's things that have been unidentified reserved to this hour is that right in Revelations 10 when it said the mighty Angel descend he began to cry out and when he cried out seven Thunders uttered their voices seven being completion Thunders being the voice of God the authority that's what it's speaking of right and then John began to write he wanted to write what was being said but the spirit said if forbid him not to write it right why because as the prophet would direct us back it's already there now that's what caused some to go off and take the seven Thunders and put it as the Seven Virtues but that's a misunderstanding because he said write it not it would be the revelation of what is already wrote is that right so here it would be taking things that were unidentified let me give you an example when before this time do you find an identification brought for when Sarah and Abraham made their Journey after the meeting in Genesis 18 and the King takes Sarah for wife when do you find an identification being spoken because the Bible says Not only was Sarah's womb Barren but the Bible tells us that Abraham's stream of life in other words no more no more coming to any other beding ground his stream of life was dried up that's good right and God sees this this is unidentified but in this hour in an hour where requires rapturing Grace and rapturing Faith God can reach back in the things that's unidentified and show you and I in order for them to have a child there had to come a change to receive the promised son and God reached to the unidentified things and he identified them in this hour and said that's what took place there and this is your message and your day pulling the identified things and identifying them in other words making them plain making them clear because this is the day where Zachariah caught and spoke of where small things are despised ah that don't matter to God anymore let me every word matters to God every word matters to God and let me just say this exactly as the prophet said you're not any stronger than your knowledge and adherence to the pure word of God so if there's one word of God that you choose not to obey your strength is broken right you understand me that's true this is these are this this is God's desire to help you and I to minister to you and yet it's Satan's desire to try to take and disqualify and water down and pull down well God didn't mean that and this really don't matter and this let me just tell you the greatest greatest deception is the voice of reasoning right if there's anything listen your reasoning if it reasons outside of the word of God forsake it amen if there's any reason let me just give you a simple one that's wrote right here the Bible said not for not to forsake to assemble ourselves together that's in the word of God there's a lot goes with that a lot of sacrifice that goes with that to be a part of the local body it's a lot of sacrifice cuz we got to sacrifice deal with opinions of one another being rubbed by one it requires sacrifice that's why many people say I don't want to be a part of a local body I to stay at home because it requires a sacrifice a marriage requires a sacrifice is that right but see even in the things like that well you know it's not really it's not that important that really doesn't matter but it's you see it does matter the ABCs of things matter where the things that were even identified in this hour have been laid in the scripture of clothing of dress of how we're to wear it's laid in the scripture it's not a mystery it's not something that was unidentified but yet you see what happens when Satan comes along he takes things that are already laying here identified and he wants to put a veil over it to make it obscure but God comes along and shows us that he's still the same and he is the word and that every word is just as effectual and in and significant as it always have been is that right oh my see God has a way of bringing significance to things remember the little story of the violin nobody wanted to bid on it in the auction it was laying up there who give me a dollar chirp chirp chirp ch ch ch ch you know the story very simple but this is how God identifies the unidentified when he took a hold of that violin a master walked up and that auction and he took that violin and he began to play it and as he begin to play it Amazing Grace wasn't a dry eye in the place the value was immediately raised what raised the value what was once unidentified has now become identified what was once seen to be that doesn't really matter that's of no value but when God comes on the scene we begin to see the value you of these things you see friend this is where even with things that God asked of you and I to do and listen sometimes the things that God is requiring is not so much a matter of salvation but if you can see you and I can see the value that's pre God let me see the value that's good preacher the value yes because remember what you might say is only $5 somebody else can come by and say that's a Victorian piece of furniture yeah that's right that's original that's worth more than $5 absolutely remember the little boy right you see his desires I just want an ice cream cone right he found a stamp in a collection man if I can just take this stamp I can get me a probably get me an ice cream cone that's the only s thing he saw on that stamp yeah and when he took it to the dealer goes down the street takes it out there and the dealer looks at it and knows this is worth a lot of money so to a little boy little understanding I give you $5 for it the little boy sayso how many ice cream cones not at the ice cream truck cuz them rip off how many ice cream cones at a real ice cream place not the you know the what they call the jingle jip you know come to rob you little trucks that drive through the neighborhood no no man $5 I can get a lot you see somebody was there who knew what the value was but they did not reveal to him what the value was and let me say this to you this of the word of God this word oh there's been things that can be look at God's A Healer praise God God's a deliverer praise God but it took God coming to reveal the value of what you have it's more than just religion it's more than just salvation it's more than just healing it's more than just to make you a better person the Holy Spirit comes to make you a new creation and release the value that God has always saw in your life you're worth more than an ice cream cone Hallelujah you're worth more than any pleasure of the world that the enemy would want to try to snatch you up there's so much more of God Amen listen to me there's more so much more than just knowing him as your savior I think that's a wonderful place to start if you don't know him as your savior start there am right you got to start somewhere we all started there it starts with repentance to recognize the god who's speaking to your heart dealing with your life that it's not man it's God but then from that place recognize that that that God who's brought that conviction in my life that which I've been loging for I want to know him I want to meet that God who brings the real peace yes that passes all understanding that's right see God has a way of bringing value yes as he identifies the unidentified things it's like a lot of times the Precious Minerals are ore that's in the ground you know a lot of times they don't know what's there in this day and age it's not that they don't know what's there he said no we don't want to do it here let's let China send it to us I'm I'm not going to get political you can see the Insanity of things that's right but the things that have laid here you know the Bible said the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof that's it already belongs to God God has provided even in the creation of the Earth the gold was laid in all the different precious ores and minerals what was needed to eat even come together to make even those things where we look at with coal and all all those Precious Minerals and or but notice how many men how many people walked over some of those places like in Kentucky where there's oil like in Texas how many times listen even over there in Saudi Arabia they're not the ones who developed that in those Arab countries that was us that's right that was us who developed that that's right that's us who did that that's right and to understand listen this is what I'm trying to say to you let's stay in the spiritual realm here I'm just using natural examples to stay in the spiritual realm it took certain instruments and it took people trained to be catch what's beneath the surface because it's not altogether what you see that's a value it's what's beneath the surface that that's unidentified that holds the great things of value that's right it takes a special instrument a special trained eye to catch and say there's something deeper there that's why the word speaks to our life your life my life and says there's something deeper there's something deeper in you there's something deeper in your life there's a deeper walk what is it it's the eye of God he promised he would guide us with his own I and he sees the potentials that lay Within You and I the unidentified things the things that you or me are not even aware that even are laying there within us think about we could go on through the scriptures here was Noah Noah was not a builder Noah was not a builder if Noah would have had to submit his resume right job Hunter would not have accepted it Head Hunter would not have accepted these are all agencies you're a farmer he looks unqualified right but he's perfectly qualified in the eyes of God Amen right unidentified as a messenger before judgment even the ark here he receives this Revelation from God about preparing an ark before judgment I wonder how many walked by it which they did they scoffed the Bible tells us there was scoffers in that day they looked upon the ark and said there's other boats right and there were but the difference was there was only one that was god-given and God constructed oh yeah and that was what was given Noah that's right all the rest of them could not rise in the Judgment are you with me that Mark to where you even know this and and and and here Sierra setting here even maybe she know it maybe she don't know it but even how the the Navy in the in the yards when I've watched years ago in their testing years ago 2ome years ago watching even looking at a documentary they will take the specifics of that Ark and every one of our aircraft carriers every one of our ships are built as far as in those relations right why because it was made they showed it in the naval tanks over there in New Jersey it could roll over at 90° and come right back up wow that's amazing god listen science isn't against God God will take science and make it testify of his word it's when man gets in it are you hearing me it's when man gets in it but God allowed that just like he'll allow the snow to to erode a little bit to melt and they'll catch that on the top of Mount erat God don't have to do that amen how many people has that changed I don't know but I would dare to say it hasn't been maybe too many people because you see Faith cometh by hearing sometimes individuals with the day and age we're living in things can become so skeptic that's good yes that's true we're living in a day of reality that's when it's nothing but pretend so true on media pretending true and then somebody else follows this oh look what they're doing look how happy they are honey we need to go in debt so we can be as happy as them try that and see how it works for you that's right it's a day of deception that's right it's a day of falsehood I don't watch them but I know enough about it you see read a little bit here and there but I always thought H what are they talking about reality TV shows who in the world's going to have let a c camera follow them all around and they're going to act just right on the Bell that's right that's true I mean you know as the old saying goes I might not have been born today but I weren't born last night I mean but you understand listen friends those little things you know what that's all to do is to take away it's like sometimes even on the simplest innocent little things and they want to subject a little bit of a a little bit of a movie a little bit of things here of oh this guy's a mind reader what's he trying to do trying to take away from the supernatural let me tell you something no prophet of God was ever a mind reader it has to be God to reveal his secrets to His prophets that's not something and I I know I'm speak speaking to you as Believers that's not something that I'm convinced of as far as just by the word that's by an experience that's right are you hearing me that's by an experience that God confirms that to our hearts oh I thank God for that I'm glad that it goes so much deeper than reasoning reasoning if it stays within the word of God but when it goes against God's word forget it here's Noah here's Moses on on Jesus disciples I who would have chose Jesus disciples right that's true matter of fact who would have chose David's Mighty Men right David's mighty men were a bunch of routs that's that's the truth nobody wanted them very true the disciples couldn't even read their name some were Tax Collectors yeah these were not altogether men of a founding reputation neither were they of Education once again God takes unidentified things and identifies himself by why didn't he take the theologians the Pharisees the Sadducees this is why the Bible said if the princes of this world do you realize what the religious sector was Paul identifies them they're princes of this world if they had known it they would not have crucified our Lord but they couldn't recognize God was identifying himself according to the word they read they quoted they said they walked around with fringes on their garment but they couldn't recognize the identified word of almighty God that's why the prophet said God takes the simple things to identify himself through h just his word think about Hebrews 11:1 he made the world out of the things that does not appear the invisible things Romans 1:20 says the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead David goes on with this I we look when you look it's God the handiwork God has set the heavens and the Earth it's God that had done that and God takes the simple things he took Gideon I mentioned Saul a moment ago after mentioning David remember when God came to Gideon insignificant Gideon even looked at himself he says my family is the poorest in manasse and I'm the least in my own family yes in other words I'm insignificant if you're wanting someone significant Lord you got the wrong guy I was sure when you said thy Mighty Man of Valor that you were talking of a significant one who was here but see God knew what was unidentified in Gideon's life in the presence of God as Gideon would continue to yield himself to God it would become identified Samuel the prophet after Saul's rejected comes into the house opens up the flask and here he is he's ready the horn he's ready to anoint and in Samuel I love that the scripture records it that Samuel walked up to the eldest son Jesse had seven sons in the house David was the eighth son true he wasn't even there that would be be like your parents having Christmas dinner and not even calling you that's right to me that's called fighting words look look even when he's asked when Samuel says in his heart Samuel looks on the eldest the stature surely this is the Lord's anointed showing listen all of us and our Humanity there's a lot of things that we have thought is the Lord's anointed surely this job is the Lord's anointed surely this thing is God's anointed but if you just keep listening he lets you know what he wants you to bless because whatever you bless what you what you yield to and you yield in his leading God will bless you and you'll be a blessing right that's the principle of God so true is that right clear for me Abraham oh he's surely the Lord's anointing went right down the line 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 now if Samuel had been like some of us Samuel said Lord I don't see anybody else in my age group surely I have to marry that one I don't see no more available these are pressures these are pressures absolutely I know what I'm talking about but he wasn't even invited David was out there tending the Sheep you know what they you know what that signified it wasn't important he's insignificant they're going to anoint a King David won't be needed for this one that's right leave him out there tending sheep that's right Samuel said you got another one yeah he's out there in the field you mean you didn't even prepare a place at the table nah he's on the field he's Ruddy insignificant he's just youth go call him we ain't sit him down till he comes inallah we will not sit down until he comes on the scene and when David entered then quickly the Lord said anoint him right yeah he was unidentified yes sir but by the word of God Amen that God delivered to a prophet and a prophet took a message to anoint David as the king David was identified David could not see his name in the book but when there like Bethlehem it wasn't wrote in the chapter of inheritance your name my name we cannot read our name in there Brian Dave Samuel uh on Aaron we don't read our name like that but it is God manifesting his word and as he manifests the mystery of himself his own life that's what calls our name am that's good Hallelujah though they could look in the book and say well I don't see your name in there I don't see your I don't see Bethlehem in Joshua chapter 15 I I don't see but see when God reveals it you see your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah unidentified but identified in his presence H let me just close on this there's absolutely no other no other place our Lord could have been born but Bethlehem and you see how the Lord has taken us to be able to see this that it's more than just us if Satan can get us just he can get you just to look look at something that has happened oh yeah he was born in a manger oh yeah he he went went to Calvary went to the Cross but what God wants you to see is why he came the way he did why he did what he did and paid the price is so that you could be a partaker this morning of his life and the reason there wasn't any room for him in the end think how God so fit this think here he is born in Bethlehem in Bethlehem least among it all little and God chooses Bethlehem not Shiloh not Jerusalem not any of these other seemingly more important and they have their place bigger cities but God chose that that it would come out of a little place something that was unidentified something that was well if we could say it like we would understand it today you would say Sho did I pass through that place there wasn't even a traffic light sometimes we'll say oh that's a one trffic light Town meaning very very small it wasn't even that until after seon salmone had come there but even then it was very small and insignificant but God had chosen by his word Before Time what I read in m in Micah chapter 5 but think about what it took to get there think about what it took to get there think about in your life and my life what it what it what God what has taken for us to get in position that's so good think about what it's taken for you and I to get in the place and God continuing to move us into position in our own lives because it don't stop it don't stop listen once you have list this is why friends listen it's very important crucial that you are born again but once you're born again you're not a fully matured son and daughter of God you grow and you develop see what happens is remember the little boy with the stamp he only saw ice cream cones this is where as you grow in the Lord you begin to see as a greater value to his word a greater value you begin to Value even his desire you begin to Dev value see your value Rises there's things that you look back wow man I didn't realize what so- and so was saying there man this is this is really important like many of us can look back to our parents and the advice they gave that's true man it took pressure taxation but when they while they were there I love how the Bible says it while they were there she was delivered of a child and God knows how to get every one of us as he as he has and as he is doing and will do into position God knows how to do it God's not asked me to pull you or you to pull me it's his word and listen and that word is going out and it's a season for that word to be fulfilled remember every unidentified part is going to be identified by him in his ordained place in your life so true and this is why that when we look at this no room for him in the end no place no place at all I think that's something where we can just pause with that that part of it here and let's just let's just stop it brings us to that reality of the God's desire is to be identified in every one of our Lives amen and I just encourage you here this morning if you don't know him in that way first of all it starts to know him as your savior your lord and savior because that's the announcement unto us this day in the city of Bethlehem is born a savior hallu that's good it begins with that there is one to save you from your sins remember the same one who saves you is like the man who picks up the Dirty Glass he picks up the dirty glass with the intention of cleaning it up and with the ultimate purpose filling it and drinking from it God wants our lives to be an offering unto him that we no longer live our life to our own ways our own self our own objectives but we live it according to the word of God and I just say let God evaluate in your life evaluate in your heart Even In This Moment In This Day we could say many things but I'd say look at it like this sometimes there might be things that you can look in your own life and areas that you might feel like I I I don't know what's going on here I don't know what's taking place there but if you just really seek God and say God at all cost I believe there's things that God I don't just believe it I know that there's things that are unidentified right now that's right that God will identify y absolutely you know the Bible says God said prove me is that right when he came with tithes and offerings God said prove me only scripture he ever said prove me let me say something God himself is a provider yes I have seen it I have seen it time and time again and I'm not talking about just out there I'm talking about right here in my own life and in my own home of things that I would have never dreamed never thought but I can tell you this right here when you put God first this ain't bragging on me I'm talking about his word when you put him first then you've put his word before him hallu that's good then what you're doing is is making room for him that's if there's things in your life that's crowding him out make room for him right amen if things crowding you out and I just say this for those who are archiving comeing stream and everything if there's things that's crowding you out of really serving God it's time to evaluate what's really important if there's things that's crowding you out from being in the house of God it's time to evaluate what's really important listen friends we want to make room for him and God will take the things that you in your reasoning and in your mind have looked at it and it looks impossible to your reasoning and to your natural mind I know that's right been there multiple times but how God makes himself known that he's still Jehovah Gyra what I'm telling you you can't outgive God I'm talking about I'm not just talking about your finances that is important but I'm talking about your time I'm talking about your dedication to the things of God that's what I'm talking about right you can never outgive the Lord that's his word if you'll steal away in secret he said I'll reward toward you openly oh my don't you love him absolutely yes sir hallelujah oh Hallelujah let's stand my oh my thank you Jesus I think about it here this morning is as we just prepare in this moment and we we stand on a Christmas Eve Lord terries tomorrow be Christmas and then we come onto a new year I think what a fitting fitting moment and a fitting time it always is when God comes and visits it's a time to really reflect it's a time to where that if you don't know the Lord It's a time to really it's a time to take that opportunity take it's an opportunity that is so precious and what God can do for you in just a moment will have an effect on the rest of your life it's Eternal and I just say this morning if you don't know him and you want to know him just start with that right there start with repenting of your sins start right there start right with the golden rule for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that whosoever would believe in him may not perish very Simplicity and I think even in our lives where you start there you look into your life and you say I need a deeper walk with God now every one of us I trust every one of us could really say that yes sir maybe the Deep deeper walk that you need maybe it's a deeper walk where it's still the habits and sanctification and go letting God just continue to work on that work inside your temple you know what you do you feed your experience of what you've already experienced of him and watch what God will do in your life that's so good maybe you need the Holy Ghost which is a further more of the same Grace more of the same Spirit coming in the depths of your life what do I do just continue to feed your experience continue to give yourself to the Lord continue to make room for him because when you we as you're making room as the word is leading you he'll come to that place a Manger a stable a place that would not be a place that we would expect a king to be born I love how the prophet took it in 63 why little Bethlehem he said in a stinking stable that's right but he said God was showing what he would do when he would come into our lives lives that were filthy lives that surely ACC would not be born there surely there won't come a king and a priest out of that life but God says I know what's down there yes sir and I'm the one who brings out and identifies the unidentified there's things every one of us can testify now in our lives and looking at the overcoming grace of God and say my Lord you've given me strengthen this area of my life I'm overcoming amen there's there's distance being put between God you're giving me Grace Hey listen friends that's overcoming Grace We're overcoming oh I say God no matter what your need is if you don't know him today it's a wonderful time to surrender it starts with simply recognizing him as your lord and savior Lord Lord I need you if you need more of him Lord I need more of that same Grace I need to go want to go deeper I want it going deeper in my life I want to go deeper I want to say Lord that's where I am I I believe in my heart I I have the subtleness I I have the Seal of God in my life I I know I I see it working I see what he's done in my life he's CH what it is he changed my nature my desires are not the desires of the world that's true well sure Satan comes and tempts here and there but I don't my desires is not for the things of the world absolutely but I want more of him Lord help me if there's areas cuz no doubt there might be areas that stand out to you right now maybe there's areas that he spoke about maybe he didn't call it out by word but just out of the light of the word come it showed you you could be making some more room right here and you know what invite him in because he does what you think is impossible where these men could have looked at Noah and said you're crazy you're building an ark a boat not near the water but he was following God God didn't need for Noah to bring the boat to the water God was going to bring the water to the boat so if you just stay that's a principle seek you first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be at add it to you God knows what you have need of no matter how strange or how odd it seems just just do what he's asking you to do make room for him and in the areas that are unidentified you'll watch him move you'll watch grow in your life and'll be filled with God you love him he's good isn't he yes he is amen let's just pray Heavenly Father well Lord I just just stand in awe Lord and thankful God that you would take us and lead us Lord and direct us through your word there's things Lord that we know that we can study and look at and thoughts that you press Upon Our Hearts but there's nothing Lord like it is when you come and and the inspiration that was given but yet Lord there's ways that you take things that my it's just it's different but it's needful Lord and you're so mindful of every every part of our life Lord I pray here this morning I certainly lord always want to ask that if there's one that doesn't know you that God they would see the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ to know that Lord that's the reason you came you came in order Lord to redeem that your blood would be shed an innocent blood to purchase and make a way for us Lord that Lord that we could become partakers of that same divine nature Lord the reality to give us the life that was before the fall that Union with you Lord oh God that satisfaction that rest that peace that reality where you come into the control tower in the will in the middle of the will the main spring like that of a watch where every other gear turns by that's your desire Lord that's the purpose of your coming the way you did is so Lord that you might bring to us that reality that we have thirsted for Lord thank you for your mercy Lord how we ask Lord that you would just continue in these moments Lord guide us Lord as you guided Lord those wise men as they follow that star Supernatural Supernatural they're the only ones who saw it supernaturally according to your word as you said back in the Book of Numbers a star shall arise out of Jacob Lord they followed it until they come to the place and I think of it God that you provided a star in this end time lord we're so thankful for that star but we know what that star was for it was to point us and show us the word is made flesh and the desire and the call of the hour is that the word would be made flesh in our lives that we might understand Lord by the grace of God and see your desire to live in US Lord and live through us help us Lord as we are standing here in this Christmas season Lord and as we would prepare to pass into the new year Lord God should you T I want to know you more help me and the the others Lord my brothers and sisters every one of us Lord help us guide us Lord the things that we know and the things that maybe that we don't know show us where Lord God that we might be able to make room for you Lord Lord you don't need great big things all you showed us right now simple little obedience you take Lord sometimes there's things that lord it's us and our Humanity we can get to saying oh if I could if I could just do this for God if I could just do that but Lord there's no higher calling to any believer than to be obedient to the voice of God there's no greater thing no higher calling we see Saul he did not value that that the further he walked the less value he gave to the word and to those who were representatives of that word but we see David David Lord oh sure David had there was some shortcomings that David had that's true you could have chose to hide that but you didn't but you said when you anointed him the part that was unidentified you said he he a man after my own heart David was willing to repent that's what Lord how your Prophet would show us that in the message of Grace well Lord I'm thankful I'm grateful because that's what the Holy Spirit comes Lord as it directs in each of Our Lives I hope we never get away from that Lord help us to be sensitive help us not to reason things away help us not to reason away parts of the word of why we can't do this or why we can't do that Lord for we know that you'll surely Lord you'll pull back because your presence accompanies your word but help us Lord that even when we don't even understand because there's many times that we don't there's times Lord like right here Among Us there's some Lord that you've healed in a way that they're standing right here with us there's others that's been healed but they went on to Glory our understanding of it I don't understand it but I believe you and I Trust You Lord I would rather have that than to have the understanding because understanding would only get me so far but trust Lord God it'll take me it'll help me it'll guide me through times Lord of hard hardness and trials and test just like it has for my brothers and sisters help us Lord help us father may we see just the value of how you value simple obedience to the word of God help us Lord I pray we love you and we thank you Lord thank you for your mercy once again Lord how we appreciate you in this hour Lord Lord we look at you we just we're so thankful God that you've come in your mercy and Grace and open our eyes Lord as we read Lord from the scriptures we're not reading from a closed book we're reading from an open book places that we can see identified I think of how your Prophet would take it in God's chosen place of worship he would say oh how I love those secret passages yes through the word of God hallelujah oh Lord Jesus as I heard your Prophet say that I thought of that scripture in Song of Solomon 21:14 when Solomon would speak to his bride oh my Dove my lovely one thou who dwellest in The Secret of the stairs come let me see your countenance let me hear your voice oh Lord I'm so thankful for the access that we have through the blood of Jesus Christ for you would liken us to your own nature oh my Dove we love you Lord Lord God if there's one Lord who doesn't know you in that way may they realize what your desire is is to be born in the manger of their heart not as though you were to be born again but they us as individuals Lord by you coming in that's the new birth that's what it means to be born again is when our life has been changed our desires have changed and there's a desire within us to press on press to Perfection help us Lord may you just continue just sweep right Among Us right now Lord give strength Lord may this be the moment where every besetting sin l loses any grip that it would have Lord May every weight that is slowed down or hindered help us Lord that it would be laid aside Lord you know even last night just studying looking at some things Lord and come across that on the study and found it so incredible how your Prophet would say God help us to lay asound lay aside every thought [Music] that would so easily beset us help us Lord because before there can ever be any action or anything that's done it begins with a thought help us to bring every thought into captivity to The Obedience of Christ help us Lord I pray we love you Lord so appreciate you bless your children Lord some that are traveling be with them Lord Lord God as different ones maybe would gather with family or different things throughout this time maybe some already have and will Lord I don't know but I'm asking that God you would just be merciful Lord God Among Us Lord May Our Lives Lord just shining the light in humility Lord we thank you for your mercy thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen go ahead let your word be bor in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it [Music] St live inside this house of place and molded every day let you were be born in the manger of my heart there was a tiny simple stable oh beaten and warn it was hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his mesty so I know if I'll give him control he'll be born in me so let your word be born in a manger of my heart let it live in me let it [Music] St live inside this house of prise and molded every day Lord let you be born in the MJ of my heart well I really I'm nothing I'm not much to behold un likely the place for his word to unfold but I I'll just SK this vessel and let him have his way oh from Glory onto Glory he change me day by day so let word be born let it be born in the manger of my heart oh Lord let it live me oh [Music] let live inside inside this house of and every [Music] day God bless you I don't want to take too much much time here but there was something that I wanted to share and the Lord was pressing upon my heart to share it so I just want to to follow his his leading uh as I was praying here and I I shared this with Brother Carlos here before the service even started and I believe it ties right into what brother Samuel was saying here at the end and uh you know we just need to stay focused on him and get get ourselves out of the way and I was praying you know Lord just keep me zer in I just I just want to be zeroed in and absolutely he just started flooding me in with with a bunch of different thoughts and you know brother Samuel has preached that in the past no doubt be zeroed in brother brandom's talked about it and um you know the the three wise men we don't know if if they had a physical Compass but we do know that they had an internal compass compass and they had yes the star to guide them and no matter if they were going east or if they were going west they were always going True North they were always zeroed in and that true north is zero on a compass it's zero so I pulled out my phone and I'm sure most of you have a compass on your phone I pulled out my phone and when you move it it's like a regular Compass it's supposed to stay on North well mine it was locked on zero no matter which way I moved it it was locked on zero I closed it out I thought it was maybe not working right I closed it out I opened it again it was stuck on zero that's so good yes sir and I'm like you know maybe I need maybe it needs an update well I don't want an update I want it stuck on zero that's good yes sir that's where I want to be stuck is on zero in my I asked I asked Amanda I said pull yours out pull your compass out she moved it around but it was moving it was working like a regular Compass mine was stuck on zero let our all of our compasses be stuck on zero [Music] absolutely I'm glad God gives us sufficient Grace to look and to examine in our own lives and that's truly our desire when God is moved in your life the only thing the one thing that we desire to do is to stay in step with him [Music] that's that's the whole secret this one [Music] [Music] thing [Music] [Music] us [Music] Al said I press for Christ [Music] jus [Music] [Music] let true word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it stop live inside this house of pain and more me every day Lord let you word be born in the mjor of my heart and I need more of you oh lord for that's the
