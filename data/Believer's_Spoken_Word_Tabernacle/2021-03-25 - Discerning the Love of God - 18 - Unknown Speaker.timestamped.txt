[36:39] we just always want to be sensitive that
[36:41] god will come and
[36:43] that always invite him never in a place
[36:46] to where we
[36:47] would feel like as though that we have
[36:49] ever we've attained to everything or
[36:51] we've
[36:52] made it or we don't need help in
[36:54] anything anymore
[36:55] but the contrary the longer that we
[36:58] serve the lord and the closer you draw
[37:00] to the lord we begin to realize
[37:02] more and more our inabilities we realize
[37:05] more that we in ourselves were not
[37:07] self-sufficient that's that's a
[37:09] that would be a great that's a great
[37:11] detriment in our walk but what begins to
[37:13] take place as we recognize
[37:15] more and more our sufficiency is of the
[37:18] lord
[37:19] he's our strength he's the one that
[37:21] guides us he's the one that directs us
[37:23] and you know
[37:23] the very moment that we would feel in
[37:26] any way as though that we have
[37:27] everything at hand and
[37:29] it doesn't matter what part of it is in
[37:31] our life that's the very time that god
[37:33] his presence will draw back from our
[37:35] life because god can never
[37:37] dwell with and work with any time
[37:40] there's anything about our life that
[37:42] would become
[37:43] puffed up as though that this is us
[37:45] that's doing this or my abilities and
[37:47] you know
[37:48] to think of it you might you know might
[37:50] be a person that has
[37:52] a lot of abilities maybe very very smart
[37:54] maybe have
[37:55] great gifts and great talents in your
[37:57] life but yet without those gifts and
[38:00] talents really being surrendered to the
[38:02] lord and looking to god that god would
[38:04] govern those
[38:05] and guide them then they're really there
[38:08] they're really nothing and god will pull
[38:10] himself back because as the scripture
[38:12] said he will not share his glory with
[38:14] another
[38:15] this is why when we begin to look at
[38:17] this last week
[38:18] and seeing this of how that it is
[38:21] something that can come
[38:22] just so subtly in a life and how that we
[38:26] we need the holy spirit to be ever
[38:29] present and we want him to discern our
[38:31] hearts we want him to discern the
[38:33] thoughts and
[38:34] we want to be ever mindful and quick to
[38:36] align with the word
[38:38] when the word is coming forth and we've
[38:41] seen how with last week how that
[38:43] meant many of these times and situations
[38:46] to where
[38:47] that a heart itself comes to a place of
[38:50] being lifted up
[38:51] when at first that heart was was in the
[38:54] right position
[38:54] it was in a place to where it was
[38:57] looking you know
[38:58] to the lord it was in the right uh in
[39:01] position of of of
[39:03] resting in what god had done for it and
[39:05] we looked at different examples in the
[39:07] scripture and begin to
[39:09] trace of where this comes from because
[39:11] we recognize that pride itself
[39:13] there's not one ounce of pride that
[39:16] would come from
[39:16] god when there's a there is there is a
[39:19] rejoicing that comes in our life but
[39:21] that rejoicing comes with an
[39:23] understanding
[39:24] that it's not us that has made ourselves
[39:27] it's not us that has done this in truth
[39:29] be known even of things that maybe that
[39:32] whether you felt to say something to
[39:34] someone or to pray about something
[39:36] the truth of the matter is it's god
[39:38] that's given us the grace in that moment
[39:40] to just submit
[39:41] to what he's impressed upon our hearts
[39:43] and we're thankful for that and may we
[39:45] always stay
[39:46] in that place because then god is able
[39:49] to really move and to use us and
[39:51] we find in the scriptures where paul
[39:53] would admonish us as believers
[39:55] knowing that there are times that
[39:57] thoughts can come our way
[39:59] and thoughts that paul would call it a
[40:02] things
[40:02] happenings that would exalt itself
[40:04] against the knowledge of god
[40:06] sometimes it isn't when these these high
[40:08] things that would exalt
[40:10] himself against the knowledge of god we
[40:12] remember we're not
[40:13] ignorant of satan's devices we know it's
[40:15] not always something that
[40:17] where a thought would come that would
[40:19] necessarily exalt
[40:21] against the word of god in the sense
[40:23] that telling us that well this is wrong
[40:25] or this is right or
[40:26] we need to believe this but sometimes it
[40:28] can be even in the way that we would
[40:31] carry ourselves
[40:32] or a feeling or an attitude but it's to
[40:35] discern that thought and bringing it
[40:37] into the word because we know
[40:38] that the word itself it produces a
[40:41] reality in our life that
[40:44] of a right attitude and a right heart
[40:46] towards the things of god
[40:48] and so paul would speak to us and
[40:50] admonish us to always to
[40:52] to cast down imagination and every high
[40:54] thing that would exalt itself
[40:56] against the knowledge of god and to
[40:58] bring it into subjection
[41:00] to the obedience of christ we look at
[41:03] this you know
[41:04] in in the examples here in the scripture
[41:06] that we
[41:07] looked at last last week and i want to
[41:09] go
[41:10] into another place here in the scripture
[41:13] and in in the book of daniel in daniel
[41:16] chapter four is where i'd like to take
[41:18] up tonight
[41:19] and we like to look here at a man that
[41:21] many of us probably would know as a
[41:23] bible reader or you've heard the name
[41:25] of nebuchadnezzar and to know that that
[41:28] this
[41:28] this king was was raised up as a tool
[41:31] in the hand of god everything that had
[41:34] been
[41:34] given to him god had given to him
[41:38] we recognized that israel you know
[41:40] israel had gone astray
[41:42] they had disobeyed they had gotten away
[41:44] from from the things of god they still
[41:46] had the prophets still had the psalms
[41:48] still had if i can bring it down in our
[41:50] terms they were still packing around the
[41:52] bible
[41:53] but their heart had gone away from god
[41:55] they had gotten away from
[41:57] from his voice and from the leading of
[41:59] his holy spirit
[42:01] and so then when they rejected all that
[42:04] god would send to him
[42:05] then god had no other recourse but that
[42:08] they would be
[42:09] delivered in the hand of one who would
[42:12] actually bring a discipline and a
[42:15] chastening to their
[42:16] life and here was a man that god had
[42:19] raised up he was a
[42:20] tool a servant in the hand of god let me
[42:22] just say this to you
[42:23] when brother branham was was here and
[42:25] remember at the time when many were
[42:27] looking at communism and looking at a
[42:29] lot of those
[42:30] things and many times the preachers they
[42:32] were speaking about that and brother
[42:34] brown told us he said
[42:35] it's not communism that you have to
[42:37] watch out for
[42:38] but he said it is that purple curtain
[42:40] that scarlet curtain
[42:42] that of romanism the roman catholic
[42:45] church he said because
[42:46] he said communism itself and we see this
[42:49] in the scripture
[42:50] it's only a tool in the hand of god to
[42:53] bring
[42:53] judgment when mercy has been rejected
[42:57] and to see that within this here of of
[43:00] this
[43:00] man by the name of nebuchadnezzar you
[43:03] know to think of
[43:05] of this time that you know what he's
[43:07] already witnessed but i'd like to break
[43:09] in on this here a moment
[43:11] in daniel 4 chapter 28 the bible says
[43:14] all this came upon the king
[43:17] nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months
[43:21] he walked in the palace of the kingdom
[43:23] of
[43:24] babylon and the king spake and said is
[43:27] not
[43:27] this great babylon that i have built for
[43:30] the house of the kingdom
[43:32] by the might of my power and for the
[43:34] honor of my majesty
[43:36] while the word was in the king's mouth
[43:38] their fellow voice from heaven saying
[43:41] o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is
[43:43] spoken
[43:44] the kingdom is departed from thee
[43:47] now i want you to notice that god had
[43:50] visited this
[43:51] king by way of a dream he had already
[43:54] and this would not be the first dream
[43:56] that he had received
[43:57] but it was the second dream that he
[43:59] received and when he received
[44:01] this dream god had made known to him as
[44:04] though
[44:05] and and put it in a symbol that it was a
[44:07] tree
[44:08] that had grown into the height of heaven
[44:10] and its leaves and
[44:12] everything was come to lodge under the
[44:14] branches and
[44:15] how that it was made to be ruler over
[44:18] over all all things here as far as upon
[44:21] the earth
[44:22] but then within that dream remember
[44:24] nebuchadnezzar himself he was not able
[44:27] to interpret that
[44:28] none of the wise men could do it but
[44:30] here came one
[44:31] who was a dedicated channel to god
[44:34] daniel
[44:34] and daniel stood there and daniel under
[44:37] inspiration he began to interpret to the
[44:40] king
[44:41] of what had taken place and he
[44:43] identified that you
[44:45] are that tree you are that one that was
[44:48] cut down to a stump
[44:50] and it begins to identify of of who it
[44:53] was
[44:54] now what we just started reading here
[44:56] this is a year
[44:57] after the dream has come to the king
[45:00] and daniel has interpreted that dream
[45:03] you would look at it for a moment
[45:05] and you would just think just for a
[45:07] minute that my goodness
[45:08] within a trance a period of time of a
[45:11] year
[45:11] you see god gives grace for repentance
[45:15] god will give a space of time when his
[45:18] word
[45:19] goes forth he'll deal with the heart
[45:21] he'll deal with the life
[45:22] he'll let it even be known this is the
[45:24] direction that things are going
[45:26] and the mercy of god it's not god's
[45:29] mercy to cut off
[45:30] something from happening but that's god
[45:33] letting you and i know
[45:34] that hey judgment is coming this is
[45:37] coming
[45:37] and here there there is a way for you
[45:41] to be made right before that judgment
[45:43] comes
[45:45] so when we look at this notice how the
[45:47] scripture it goes on
[45:48] in here this is all taking place even
[45:51] after
[45:52] nebuchadnezzar has heard this he's
[45:54] listen
[45:55] this man he's not ignorant of the power
[45:58] of god
[45:59] you understand he's he's witnessed here
[46:02] this very man
[46:03] has witnessed that god that when all of
[46:06] the astrologers
[46:07] musicians and wise men of the kingdom
[46:10] not one of them
[46:11] could interpret the first stream but god
[46:14] didn't only interpret it
[46:15] god revealed it to daniel what was in
[46:18] the king's heart
[46:19] and none of the rest of the wise men
[46:20] knew it it was the king that was getting
[46:23] ready
[46:23] to slay everybody and daniel stepped
[46:26] forth and he said
[46:28] why is the king so hasty he said let
[46:31] us look to god who reveals the secrets
[46:35] and let us let us beseech the mercies of
[46:37] almighty god
[46:39] and here daniel stands in this time and
[46:41] it's revealed in that moment
[46:43] of exactly what that whole dream is
[46:46] which would
[46:46] it would unfold the whole gentile
[46:49] kingdom and
[46:50] how each of those parts would would play
[46:52] out and even yet in the finality
[46:55] that is taking place in the earth even
[46:58] right now
[46:58] to that even of the iron that comes out
[47:00] there and mixed with the clay
[47:02] to where it would come into that place
[47:04] but notice even right after that he's
[47:07] seen the power of god
[47:08] he's witnessed it to where even when his
[47:11] heart
[47:11] right after that dream was interpreted
[47:14] he became
[47:14] haughty in his heart and he wanted to
[47:17] force
[47:18] all of them to come and worship this
[47:20] image
[47:21] that he erected and if they'll just
[47:23] worship it then they'll be at peace
[47:26] and we can see everything even right now
[47:28] let me make us
[47:29] let me make a quantum leap to now we see
[47:31] that everything itself
[47:33] is heading up to the mark of the beast
[47:36] we see
[47:36] everything but things are coming in to
[47:39] position because
[47:40] let me remind you it is not something
[47:43] that as far as for the natural
[47:44] eye will catch it but it is the holy
[47:47] spirit
[47:48] that has come in this hour to reveal
[47:51] the word to our hearts and call us out
[47:54] of
[47:54] babylon to call us out of confusion
[47:58] as a matter of fact it's an announcement
[48:00] of god's mercy
[48:01] because the stone that smacks the image
[48:04] in the feet that stone is already on the
[48:07] way
[48:08] you see to recognize the the time that
[48:11] we're living in
[48:12] he witnessed how that the three hebrew
[48:15] children he
[48:16] threw them in the fiery furnace and god
[48:19] delivered them he's a witness so he's
[48:22] not
[48:22] absent of knowing the power of god let
[48:25] me bring it down
[48:26] he sat in services he knew the power of
[48:28] god
[48:29] he knew the working of god but yet here
[48:32] in this moment
[48:33] when the word has gone forth to discern
[48:36] his heart and to let him know this is a
[48:39] condition in your life
[48:40] that i see taking place
[48:44] and instead of repenting he doesn't
[48:47] repent of it
[48:49] notice in verse 32 they shall drive
[48:53] thee this is the word that's spoken to
[48:55] him they shall drive thee from men
[48:58] and thy dwelling shall be with the beast
[49:00] of the field
[49:01] and they shall make thee to eat grass as
[49:04] oxen
[49:05] and seven times shall pass over thee
[49:09] until thou know that the most high
[49:12] ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth
[49:15] it
[49:16] to whomsoever he will the same hour was
[49:19] the thing fulfilled
[49:20] upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven
[49:23] from men
[49:24] and did eat grass as an oxen and his
[49:26] body
[49:27] was wet with the dew of heaven till his
[49:29] hairs were grown like eagle's feathers
[49:32] and his nails like bird's claws
[49:35] he already this was known this this
[49:39] now is a result of what he was already
[49:42] he was already told that there's a
[49:45] condition
[49:46] that is set up inside your heart oh for
[49:49] the mercy of god
[49:50] that god would come by and would
[49:53] actually let him know there's a
[49:54] condition
[49:55] in your heart that's not right you see
[49:58] that's god's mercy to you and i
[50:00] what that is is the love of god you see
[50:03] the love of god was not there to tell
[50:05] him
[50:05] you're all right but the love of god was
[50:08] there to really deal
[50:09] that this condition if you let it go on
[50:12] it's going to be
[50:13] your destruction it was god's mercy you
[50:17] see
[50:18] this puffing up it's that of a blowing
[50:20] like we said last week
[50:21] lack of a balloon that's blowed up it
[50:23] gets filled with a lot of air
[50:25] that's what pride is pride is a lot of
[50:28] air substance that is nothing but when
[50:32] the winds of the holy ghost go to
[50:33] blowing brother
[50:34] the winds of the holy ghost it does not
[50:37] puff us up
[50:38] it brings change it brings comes down in
[50:41] our lives
[50:42] and it discerns our heart that's why
[50:44] it's so necessary
[50:46] we need the holy ghost to come and take
[50:48] the word
[50:49] and discern our thoughts discern our
[50:51] hearts you say
[50:52] i don't want that i want that i want my
[50:55] heart to be discerned
[50:56] i want my life to be deserved i don't
[50:58] want to know where
[50:59] all my good places are at i know that
[51:02] already but i want to know where my weak
[51:04] places are
[51:05] because i need to know that because i'm
[51:07] sure
[51:08] that what i think is not weak but god
[51:10] said
[51:11] that's weak and it needs to be
[51:14] strengthened in that area and it takes
[51:17] it takes
[51:18] god to come and do it but god will not
[51:21] do it without an invitation
[51:23] and recognition that lord i need you
[51:27] i need you lord
[51:30] think of this here here daniel the very
[51:33] last part of that
[51:35] in verse 27 when he had spoke the dream
[51:39] i want you to notice these words this is
[51:41] before
[51:42] it came to pass this was the year before
[51:45] it happened
[51:46] verse 27 he said wherefore o king
[51:50] let my counsel be acceptable unto thee
[51:55] and break off thy sins by righteousness
[51:58] and that iniquities by showing mercy
[52:01] to the poor if it may be a lengthening
[52:05] of thy tranquility see here's god
[52:08] this is god giving mercy let what is
[52:12] being spoken
[52:13] let it be acceptable unto thee
[52:16] you see when we look at this we see what
[52:19] had already taken place
[52:21] that already in his heart before it was
[52:24] anything that could ever be seen on the
[52:27] outside
[52:28] the spirit of god was dealing with the
[52:31] heart you see
[52:32] before things ever come out here it's
[52:35] it happens down here before you can
[52:38] ever disbelieve the truth you must
[52:41] believe a lie
[52:42] is that right before eve could ever fall
[52:45] and
[52:46] disbelief to the truth she had to accept
[52:48] satan's lie
[52:50] it's always what begins on the inside
[52:53] this is why
[52:54] where we need the word as the word is a
[52:57] living reality that comes and it
[52:59] discerns the very thoughts
[53:01] and intents of the heart and we want to
[53:03] be honest with god
[53:04] the bible said whosoever covereth his
[53:07] sins
[53:08] hideth them he's not blessed but
[53:10] whosoever will confess his sins
[53:13] to him is mercy oh my we want to be say
[53:16] god
[53:17] let me be tender let me tell you
[53:19] something this world
[53:20] is not tender at all the spirit of this
[53:23] world
[53:24] think of the compounding haters of god
[53:26] despisers boasters that's scripture
[53:29] that's a sign of the last days when with
[53:32] truce breakers
[53:34] without natural affection they are
[53:36] despisers of them that are good
[53:38] haters of fathers and mothers that's the
[53:41] spirit
[53:42] that's working out there in this time
[53:44] listen to me
[53:45] it's not that of the people there has
[53:48] already been a letdown
[53:50] before when god's word came and god was
[53:53] speaking to people's hearts
[53:55] god was dealing even with the ministry
[53:58] that was standing
[53:59] in the pulpit at that time and telling
[54:02] them you're letting down on the word
[54:04] and you can't let down on the word and
[54:06] expect
[54:07] word results you can't cater to the very
[54:10] nature
[54:11] of fallen nature of a person all you end
[54:14] up doing is producing there
[54:16] of hollow shells in the pew but it takes
[54:18] the holy ghost
[54:20] to go down on the inside and deal with
[54:22] that inner man
[54:23] and bring conviction to let them know
[54:26] they're a sinner
[54:27] and they need to be set free
[54:31] hallelujah that being a church member
[54:34] won't be good enough on that day but
[54:37] it's got to be one
[54:38] that has been washed in the blood of the
[54:41] lamb
[54:42] amen that's been filled with the holy
[54:44] ghost
[54:46] glory be to god and god provided a way
[54:52] let my counsel he said be acceptable
[54:55] unto thee break off thy sins
[54:59] so this this inward part the bible
[55:03] speaks many places of pride but i want
[55:06] to read just a few places here
[55:09] in proverbs 16 18. now you might sit
[55:12] here
[55:13] and you might say oh brother samuel
[55:17] you're preaching to the unbeliever and
[55:18] to make believer no no i'm preaching to
[55:20] the believer
[55:23] because this word ain't going to change
[55:25] an unbeliever
[55:27] but what it'll do it'll take a life that
[55:30] has been looking like an unbeliever
[55:31] or make-believer and it'll bring a
[55:33] transformation to a believer
[55:35] is that right and it'll take a believer
[55:37] and make him more conscious
[55:39] and more aware that always around them
[55:42] is an enemy
[55:43] that's lurking because even after being
[55:46] born again you still
[55:48] dwell in this body and let me tell you
[55:52] something
[55:52] this first birth that is around us
[55:57] this first birth was a birth that was
[56:00] based
[56:00] on not humility but based on becoming
[56:04] something
[56:05] greater so pride itself
[56:09] is always something that we will deal
[56:11] with
[56:12] and battle with and have to bring in
[56:14] subjection
[56:15] every day of our life it can come in
[56:19] many different ways
[56:21] many different forms it can come
[56:23] sometimes in the most
[56:24] subtle of ways i i've referred to your
[56:27] quote the other day or the other last
[56:28] time we preached
[56:29] and how can i overcome when brother
[56:31] brahman started talking about he said
[56:32] sisters he said you're letting your hair
[56:34] grow long and he's dealing with how he
[56:36] says
[56:37] bringing that out in the scripture he
[56:38] said but he said if you're not careful
[56:40] he said how a spirit
[56:42] he said can try to move in there and try
[56:44] to present itself to you
[56:45] oh my you didn't realize how good you
[56:47] looked in long hair
[56:48] now see having long hair is right
[56:51] according to the word of god
[56:52] but brother rahm says when that spirit
[56:54] moves right around then it begins to
[56:56] change
[56:57] in a manner he says to where you get to
[57:00] feeling a little bit lifted up
[57:01] he said we've got to overcome that
[57:06] isn't it something how the devil he'll
[57:08] take something that is
[57:10] absolutely right in line with god's word
[57:13] but he'll come right around in that and
[57:19] blow it up the bible says pride goeth
[57:23] before
[57:24] destruction in proverbs notice goeth
[57:27] before and a holy spirit before a fall
[57:31] better is it to be of a humble spirit
[57:33] with the lowly
[57:35] than to divide the spoil with the proud
[57:40] destruction the heart of man
[57:43] is haughty and before honor is humility
[57:48] you think of this there's there's been i
[57:51] i just
[57:52] just had seen a a little a little clip
[57:54] and they dealt with five they just dealt
[57:56] with five people
[57:57] of what things that they had spoken
[58:00] against god
[58:01] and one of them you're familiar with is
[58:02] that of the the owner of the titanic
[58:04] they asked him
[58:05] how safe is this ship his response was
[58:08] i'll tell you how safe it is god
[58:10] couldn't even sink this ship
[58:15] he mocked god
[58:19] then there's another one i come across
[58:21] and i i don't know i haven't researched
[58:24] all the way into it but there's a time
[58:25] that where it says
[58:26] marilyn monroe she was on a set for a
[58:28] movie and billy graham went to her
[58:31] and billy graham went to her and began
[58:32] to preach salvation and said
[58:34] you need to turn your life around and
[58:37] what she told him is
[58:38] i don't need that jesus
[58:43] over and over many things you know you
[58:46] hear that of the man who was one of the
[58:47] head and leads of the beatles and he
[58:50] rises up in 1966 and he says
[58:53] christianity will be extinguished
[58:56] how can you say that he said i'm certain
[58:59] it will be
[59:00] he said because the followers of jesus
[59:02] are just too
[59:03] simple we are more popular than him
[59:10] a few years later right in front of his
[59:12] house someone shot him in the head
[59:14] six times you can't mock god
[59:18] and expect to go on
[59:22] what a sad thing what was it what was it
[59:24] that came upon those people
[59:26] what was it it's the same one who
[59:30] inspired
[59:30] the king of tyre the same one we read
[59:33] about in isaiah
[59:34] 14 that inspired babylon they come to
[59:37] such a place
[59:38] to where the enemy had taken over to
[59:41] where
[59:41] satan himself was able to express
[59:45] through their life no man in their right
[59:48] mind would ever say
[59:50] such a thing as that
[59:54] before destruction the heart of a man is
[59:57] haughty
[59:58] and before honor is humility and a man's
[1:00:01] pride
[1:00:02] shall bring him low but honor
[1:00:05] shall uphold the humble in spirit
[1:00:09] what a contrast between pride
[1:00:12] and humility
[1:00:16] here daniel speaks to belshazzar
[1:00:20] the son of nebuchadnezzar now this is
[1:00:23] this is after nebuchadnezzar's passing
[1:00:25] but we find
[1:00:27] we find a condition that's rising with
[1:00:30] belted shazza
[1:00:31] where he himself is rising in pride in
[1:00:34] his heart
[1:00:35] and notice notice what what daniel
[1:00:38] speaks he says
[1:00:39] o thou king the most high god gave
[1:00:42] nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and
[1:00:45] majesty and glory and honor notice who
[1:00:49] gave him this
[1:00:50] god gave him this
[1:00:53] who was it that blessed america
[1:00:57] god blessed america when they started
[1:01:00] out
[1:01:00] there was a seat at the end of the table
[1:01:04] as i mentioned to you last week many of
[1:01:06] the things that were
[1:01:07] laws and things that were originally set
[1:01:09] out it was
[1:01:10] all centered around god
[1:01:15] remember this this the very land that
[1:01:17] we're sitting in
[1:01:19] it was it was that fulfillment of
[1:01:21] prophecy
[1:01:22] in revelations 12 there's compound
[1:01:24] meaning in that scripture
[1:01:25] but it was that where that had fled from
[1:01:28] the dragon
[1:01:29] it moved there remember how the light
[1:01:31] itself kept moving
[1:01:33] it jumped across the english channel it
[1:01:35] moved over into england and then here it
[1:01:37] comes right across there
[1:01:38] of the atlantic ocean and comes right
[1:01:40] into that of america this
[1:01:42] is that place that god had given that
[1:01:45] the gospel
[1:01:46] itself could go forth it was not the
[1:01:48] purpose was not that the land itself
[1:01:50] would prosper and become such great
[1:01:52] things
[1:01:53] i tell you for some of you that's never
[1:01:55] been out of the country in certain other
[1:01:56] places
[1:01:57] there are many countries that have been
[1:01:59] around hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:02:02] a whole lot longer than we have but yet
[1:02:05] when you go
[1:02:05] into them it would seem like as though
[1:02:07] they were just come into existence
[1:02:10] in the last 50 years or so things can be
[1:02:13] so antiquated now i'm not talking about
[1:02:15] a lot of people they've got the
[1:02:16] millstone got smartphones and everything
[1:02:18] else now but i'm talking about
[1:02:20] water electricity just some of the basic
[1:02:22] things
[1:02:23] that we take for life to see the
[1:02:26] advancement the scripture would call it
[1:02:28] being that of the lamb in revelations 13
[1:02:31] but yet here
[1:02:32] as over time where things begin to get
[1:02:35] away
[1:02:35] and things begin to recede to where
[1:02:37] after a period of time
[1:02:39] they begin to look at how things have
[1:02:41] been built up and we've gotten this and
[1:02:44] we've gotten this
[1:02:45] but it wasn't america that got guarded
[1:02:47] it was god's blessings
[1:02:48] why because they stayed true to the word
[1:02:52] of god
[1:02:53] there were men of god who stayed true to
[1:02:56] the word there were people that stayed
[1:02:58] true to the word do you realize
[1:02:59] brother branham picks it up there's a
[1:03:01] dinner that's held every year or when a
[1:03:03] president
[1:03:04] is getting ready to be elected i can't
[1:03:06] remember the man's name right now
[1:03:07] brother braham said that would have been
[1:03:09] the first catholic president he said but
[1:03:11] the pentecostal church
[1:03:12] they rose up and began to pray and that
[1:03:15] man who was nearly elected
[1:03:17] back in 1920 he said it was the prayers
[1:03:20] of the pentecostal church that caused
[1:03:23] that
[1:03:23] to be withstood in that hour but then he
[1:03:26] says
[1:03:27] what about now speaking when kennedy was
[1:03:29] elected
[1:03:31] see how things were just had just
[1:03:33] brought down
[1:03:34] in such a way it's very parallel you see
[1:03:36] there's a part about it listen to me
[1:03:38] friends
[1:03:39] when god would even deal with israel in
[1:03:42] deuteronomy 8 and he would let him know
[1:03:44] when you come into the land
[1:03:46] you'll build goodly houses your your
[1:03:48] flocks and
[1:03:49] your cattle everything will prosper and
[1:03:51] he says when thou art
[1:03:53] eaten and full then remember
[1:03:57] to give thanks unto god
[1:04:00] do not forget him but remember to give
[1:04:03] thanks unto god
[1:04:05] but after a period of time see god
[1:04:07] knowing that within the part of humanity
[1:04:10] it can be something to have it can so
[1:04:13] subtly go
[1:04:14] to where if you look in the first few
[1:04:16] years no doubt here they were they were
[1:04:18] faithful as can be
[1:04:19] and i'm not talking let me tell you
[1:04:20] something faithfulness it goes a lot
[1:04:22] deeper than just coming to church
[1:04:24] that's one part of it right there but
[1:04:26] let me tell you something it goes into a
[1:04:28] faithful life
[1:04:29] that even when you're not here on monday
[1:04:32] tuesday wednesday
[1:04:33] friday and saturday your life is still
[1:04:36] in the presence of god
[1:04:38] you're not identified as a christian
[1:04:40] because you come here to church
[1:04:42] you're identified as a christian because
[1:04:44] christ
[1:04:45] himself lives inside of you the devil's
[1:04:49] not afraid of anybody
[1:04:50] but just because they come to this
[1:04:52] church or any other church
[1:04:54] but what is it that backs the devil up
[1:04:56] it's the thunder and power
[1:04:58] of the holy ghost that's in our life
[1:05:01] that beats out what
[1:05:02] humility humility
[1:05:08] but to think where it would come to such
[1:05:10] a time
[1:05:12] to where brother adam would identify
[1:05:15] when they would pass that measure about
[1:05:17] taking prayer
[1:05:19] out of schools
[1:05:22] brother braham said that was an angry
[1:05:24] outburst from satan
[1:05:27] and the woman who was behind it all
[1:05:30] her statements was as long as we've got
[1:05:34] an army
[1:05:34] and a navy we don't need old jehovah
[1:05:40] and i got brother bram said it he said
[1:05:42] it's give me jehovah or nothing
[1:05:46] it's got to be god or nothing but you
[1:05:49] see there's a tendency
[1:05:50] this is why look look how brother ryan
[1:05:52] would address it he talks about even
[1:05:54] when he said
[1:05:55] a new church would be built or moving
[1:05:57] into a new building notice the
[1:05:59] council that's given he didn't say well
[1:06:01] it's only certain people that
[1:06:03] are bothered this way it's to let you
[1:06:05] and i know
[1:06:06] there is a part about our life that must
[1:06:08] be reigned over
[1:06:10] he said usually when people come into a
[1:06:12] new church or something
[1:06:14] you know or something's done maybe it's
[1:06:15] remodeling or maybe it's something else
[1:06:17] he said there usually ends up being
[1:06:19] something about them they
[1:06:20] they get a little lifted up or something
[1:06:22] but you see it's to recognize
[1:06:24] that this part right here it's still
[1:06:27] unconverted
[1:06:28] it will not come into the real
[1:06:30] conversion
[1:06:31] until the change of the body but in the
[1:06:34] meantime
[1:06:35] it must be sensitive to that and heed to
[1:06:37] the counsel of the word
[1:06:39] that's what that's my desire i don't
[1:06:41] want to look at it and say god i've got
[1:06:43] this all under control
[1:06:44] no sir i take that admonition of the
[1:06:47] lord to know
[1:06:48] that i'm still in this old pest house
[1:06:51] as a matter of fact the best this life
[1:06:53] can be compared to
[1:06:55] is a stinking rotten dump is that right
[1:06:58] but to thank the mercy of god that would
[1:07:01] speak to our hearts and warn us
[1:07:03] of these things you see it's it's odd
[1:07:05] sometimes you know you've seen it i've
[1:07:07] seen it
[1:07:07] you watch how that a person all of a
[1:07:09] sudden they'll fall on hard times
[1:07:11] maybe they're having a difficulty on
[1:07:13] their job and or something's coming up
[1:07:15] my goodness all of a sudden you start
[1:07:17] hearing all the prayer requests
[1:07:18] you start hearing all these things
[1:07:20] taking place and then they'll start
[1:07:22] coming to church
[1:07:22] for a period of time how many times had
[1:07:24] i prayed over people
[1:07:26] that god would pray bless them with a
[1:07:28] job so they could come
[1:07:29] to midweek service because that came out
[1:07:31] of their mouth they will be held
[1:07:34] accountable when god has blessed them
[1:07:36] with an opportunity to come to the house
[1:07:39] of god
[1:07:39] but instead when it gets to a place they
[1:07:42] start feeling
[1:07:43] comfortable come on friends it's this
[1:07:46] flesh
[1:07:47] it's this flesh this flesh is not yet
[1:07:50] redeemed
[1:07:52] that's not to get comfortable well you
[1:07:54] know everything's all right
[1:07:56] no it should be within that time always
[1:07:59] remember it is god that has supplied
[1:08:01] your needs
[1:08:02] it is god that has given you favor with
[1:08:05] your boss
[1:08:05] it's god that's giving you favor with
[1:08:08] those around you
[1:08:09] it's god that's blessed you with
[1:08:11] understanding
[1:08:12] it's god that's given you wisdom it's
[1:08:14] god that's given you skills
[1:08:16] always honor him by putting him
[1:08:22] first
[1:08:26] notice the most high gave him these
[1:08:28] things verse 19
[1:08:30] and for the majesty that he gave him all
[1:08:32] people's nations
[1:08:33] languages trembled and feared before him
[1:08:36] whom he would slow or slay whom he would
[1:08:40] he would he kept alive whom he would
[1:08:41] have kept alive whom he would he set up
[1:08:43] whom he would he put down so here he was
[1:08:45] giving
[1:08:46] given a dominion
[1:08:52] but when his heart was lifted up
[1:08:56] and his mind hardened in pride
[1:09:00] he was disposed from his kingly throne
[1:09:04] and they took his glory from him
[1:09:07] he was driven from the sons of men his
[1:09:10] heart was made like the beast
[1:09:13] and his dwelling was with the wild asses
[1:09:15] and they fed him with grass like
[1:09:17] oxen can you imagine that he went from
[1:09:20] eating on king's dishes
[1:09:22] to roaning around right out here eating
[1:09:24] grass
[1:09:26] he didn't know he was eating grass his
[1:09:28] heart had been changed
[1:09:33] here he was a king but he was acting
[1:09:36] like an animal
[1:09:38] that's what he thought he was pride
[1:09:41] pride
[1:09:42] led him to this behavior you want to
[1:09:44] know why people are acting the way they
[1:09:46] are
[1:09:47] you want to know why pride it's come to
[1:09:50] such a place
[1:09:51] of pride to where now the ways of
[1:09:55] behaviors
[1:09:56] i mean whatever you want to be if you
[1:09:57] want to be a dog girl boy whatever you
[1:09:59] want to be today you can be whatever you
[1:10:00] want to be
[1:10:03] are you with me pride pride
[1:10:08] and pride keeps going with sin it keeps
[1:10:11] going
[1:10:12] you see this is why even among the
[1:10:14] churches i remember years ago when
[1:10:17] brother richard was back there doing the
[1:10:18] sunday school in the back room
[1:10:20] and there was a group of young people
[1:10:21] that was back there then
[1:10:23] brother richard had me to come in at
[1:10:24] that time and he had me to you know to
[1:10:26] give my testimony
[1:10:27] i turned around and i asked some of them
[1:10:29] back then i i looked right at him i said
[1:10:31] now let me ask you which one of you
[1:10:33] which one of you would go go to a church
[1:10:34] and somebody walks out the door
[1:10:36] and the pastor and the deacons and the
[1:10:37] ministers they're out there smoking
[1:10:39] cigarettes
[1:10:41] which one of you and i called out some
[1:10:42] of you i called out some of their names
[1:10:44] i said which one of you would do that
[1:10:46] which one of you would do that where a
[1:10:48] man's out here running with another
[1:10:49] man's wife
[1:10:50] would you would you go along with that
[1:10:51] could you have confidence in that
[1:10:53] absolutely not you couldn't have
[1:10:55] confidence in it whatsoever
[1:10:57] there's got to be a life that's lived
[1:10:59] behind it
[1:11:01] it's a life that beats for almighty god
[1:11:04] there's god then that's what the holy
[1:11:07] spirit produces
[1:11:08] he does not produce just good people
[1:11:11] there's a lot
[1:11:12] of good people out there i know a lot of
[1:11:14] good people
[1:11:15] but the holy ghost it brings forth new
[1:11:18] life
[1:11:18] new birth new creation it transforms
[1:11:22] lives where it's no longer people trying
[1:11:25] to live a good life there has come a
[1:11:27] change
[1:11:28] on the inside of them but it all started
[1:11:32] where our pride had to be dealt with
[1:11:37] our pride had to be dealt with
[1:11:41] and we had to yield to a place to where
[1:11:44] our pride would be surrendered to god
[1:11:46] and say god
[1:11:48] i give completely over to you
[1:11:52] this was his he was his body was wet
[1:11:55] with the dew of heaven
[1:11:56] till he knew that the most high god
[1:11:59] ruled in the kingdom of men
[1:12:01] and that he appointed over it whosoever
[1:12:03] he will
[1:12:07] brown makes this brother brown makes a
[1:12:08] statement he says
[1:12:13] this king he said he got exalted in his
[1:12:15] heart i want you to listen this
[1:12:17] that just runs in the nature
[1:12:20] of gentiles
[1:12:24] that runs in the nature of gentiles
[1:12:28] to to be as he said get puffed up about
[1:12:32] something
[1:12:34] but if you've been regenerated if you've
[1:12:37] been born of the spirit of god
[1:12:39] there's another nature on the inside
[1:12:43] you might still deal with this corner on
[1:12:45] the outside but he who was on the throne
[1:12:47] no longer there there's a new king on
[1:12:50] the inside
[1:12:51] no longer dealing with the strains of
[1:12:53] that or subservient to that
[1:12:55] but there is strains of eternal life
[1:12:57] strains of predestination
[1:12:59] that flow out through our life oh i
[1:13:01] thank god for that don't you now to
[1:13:04] think of this
[1:13:05] brother adam would deal with this
[1:13:06] because when the scripture taught
[1:13:08] tells us that this this king
[1:13:11] nebuchadnezzar
[1:13:12] the bible said his heart was lifted up
[1:13:14] and his mind was hardened this
[1:13:15] it means that hardening it means to be
[1:13:19] arrogant to be arrogant
[1:13:23] now brother branham he says it like this
[1:13:25] in the message humble thyself he said
[1:13:27] the main thing at the bottom of that
[1:13:28] first quote the main thing is
[1:13:30] love god and humble yourself
[1:13:33] with it i want you to watch these words
[1:13:37] love god and humble
[1:13:41] yourself with it lord you humble me
[1:13:45] god says you humble yourself with it
[1:13:49] you see this this deals with
[1:13:51] relationship
[1:13:53] with him that we would keep ourselves
[1:13:57] little keep ourselves small that's a big
[1:14:00] task right there
[1:14:01] that's a big task now he said surely
[1:14:04] after all these years on the field
[1:14:06] and around the world and seeing
[1:14:08] different people i ought to know a
[1:14:09] little bit about the gate to enter in at
[1:14:11] if you want to get somewhere with god
[1:14:14] never
[1:14:14] let an arrogant spirit ever come
[1:14:18] around you it didn't mean it won't try
[1:14:22] but he said don't let it come around you
[1:14:24] it might come it can
[1:14:26] come in there to the mind present itself
[1:14:28] but remember
[1:14:29] cast it down all right cast it down
[1:14:33] the ways of brother brahma go into he
[1:14:34] says don't let no malice come in
[1:14:36] no matter what anybody does if they are
[1:14:39] wrong
[1:14:40] don't you never build a complex
[1:14:43] against that person you be sweet and
[1:14:46] kind
[1:14:47] remember god loved you when you were in
[1:14:49] sin and if the spirit of god is in you
[1:14:52] you love the other person when he's
[1:14:54] wrong see just pray for them
[1:14:56] and love one another
[1:15:00] this this whole a whole part when we
[1:15:03] deal with humility i
[1:15:05] we're talking about an n word we're
[1:15:07] talking about an inward condition
[1:15:09] as we read this about pride this is
[1:15:12] inwardly
[1:15:13] this is why it takes the spirit of god
[1:15:15] to really deal with our lives and deal
[1:15:17] with our hearts let me just say this to
[1:15:18] you
[1:15:19] i don't believe that we've got to wait
[1:15:21] till we get to the house of god for
[1:15:22] conviction
[1:15:26] you say why do you believe that because
[1:15:27] i'm a witness
[1:15:30] i i'm a witness to where when i'm
[1:15:32] listening to the message
[1:15:33] when i'm reading the scriptures even
[1:15:35] when i'm walking when i'm
[1:15:37] when i'm just going about just thinking
[1:15:39] upon things of god listen
[1:15:40] this is what the promise said in joshua
[1:15:43] 1 if we would
[1:15:44] meditate upon the things of god that
[1:15:46] shall make that way
[1:15:48] prosperous and of a good success god
[1:15:52] knows just keeping him before us
[1:15:54] god is there to guide and direct us and
[1:15:56] i believe there's conviction
[1:15:58] that can strike our heart before you
[1:16:01] even do wrong
[1:16:02] much less after wrongs been done can
[1:16:05] convict you and say god
[1:16:06] i need your mercy lord i need your
[1:16:09] strength lord forgive me lord
[1:16:11] maybe a wrong attitude or wrong thought
[1:16:13] and you catch it
[1:16:14] before it allows itself to build a
[1:16:17] stronghold
[1:16:18] in your life quickly you catch it and
[1:16:20] say and cast it down and say
[1:16:22] that's not like jesus
[1:16:28] you're a ruler you're made to be a ruler
[1:16:31] over these things you have authority
[1:16:33] to capture those thoughts and bring them
[1:16:35] in subjection
[1:16:37] but the challenge is because a lot of
[1:16:39] times it will allied align
[1:16:41] with that first carnal nature
[1:16:44] you've got a right you could see
[1:16:48] it'll align with and this is where the
[1:16:50] battle
[1:16:51] comes in the greater is he that's in us
[1:16:54] than he that's in the world
[1:16:56] this is why the scripture would go on to
[1:16:58] say
[1:17:00] in the book in the book of james i don't
[1:17:01] have time to read it but it deals with
[1:17:03] in in our lives let me just read it
[1:17:05] quickly here james 4 6
[1:17:07] it says god resisteth the proud but
[1:17:09] giveth grace
[1:17:10] unto the humble submit yourselves
[1:17:13] therefore to god
[1:17:14] and resist the devil and he will flee
[1:17:17] from
[1:17:17] you these are not a humble
[1:17:20] it's not about looking of a certain way
[1:17:24] how do i hold my mouth or how do i hold
[1:17:26] my body that ain't humility
[1:17:28] humility is a condition of the heart
[1:17:32] it's humbled unto god humbled unto his
[1:17:34] word
[1:17:36] humbled when god brings something to
[1:17:37] your attention say forgive me lord
[1:17:40] it's submitting unto god this is a
[1:17:42] promise that works
[1:17:43] it doesn't say resist the devil first it
[1:17:45] says submit yourself
[1:17:47] unto god this word deals with arranging
[1:17:50] ourselves
[1:17:51] like military troops underneath their
[1:17:54] commander
[1:17:56] then resist the devil and he'll flee
[1:17:59] as he goes on to say draw night to god
[1:18:01] he'll draw nine to you
[1:18:03] in james 4 10 humble humble yourselves
[1:18:06] in the sight
[1:18:07] of the lord and he shall lift
[1:18:10] you up notice in the sight of god
[1:18:15] that quickly that quickly a heart just
[1:18:17] coming in
[1:18:18] humility to almighty god i tell you
[1:18:22] pride is such a it's it's a horrible
[1:18:24] thing
[1:18:27] because what happened with this man
[1:18:29] nebuchadnezzar he couldn't even remember
[1:18:32] he wasn't ignorant that it was god who
[1:18:35] do put this
[1:18:36] these kingdoms in his hand it was even
[1:18:40] daniel stood there under the
[1:18:42] interpretation of the first vision
[1:18:44] and let him know thou art that king
[1:18:46] who's the head of gold
[1:18:48] god hath given this to you it is god
[1:18:51] taketh down king set of kings up
[1:18:53] change the seasons change his time he he
[1:18:56] heard this he wasn't
[1:18:57] ignorant that he hadn't heard it he had
[1:19:00] heard it
[1:19:01] but evidently over a period of time
[1:19:05] it got to a place his heart he came into
[1:19:08] a condition
[1:19:09] think about what we looked at last week
[1:19:11] with uzziah it wasn't just
[1:19:13] over time but it's when things got
[1:19:16] comfortable when he felt strong
[1:19:19] when he felt like he was in control
[1:19:23] but it was in that time his heart got
[1:19:25] lifted up
[1:19:27] i want you let me just move on here and
[1:19:29] try to bring this down here
[1:19:30] into into a close here tonight
[1:19:34] let's look at the end of this man
[1:19:37] nebuchadnezzar
[1:19:39] you see when we look at this there's a
[1:19:41] lot of ways as the lord just
[1:19:43] kind of takes it to our heart tonight we
[1:19:45] can see a lot of a lot of places a lot
[1:19:47] of types and things within this
[1:19:50] but i want you to remember what was
[1:19:52] spoke to him
[1:19:53] and what the vision declared it declared
[1:19:57] that the tree is going to be cut down
[1:19:59] but there was a commandment
[1:20:00] don't touch the stump and the roots
[1:20:05] because god was already showing within
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:09] there would be a humility a humbling
[1:20:13] of nebuchadnezzar think about it god
[1:20:16] could have just
[1:20:17] wiped him out but the mercy of god
[1:20:21] would bring him down to a place to where
[1:20:24] he could look up
[1:20:26] and god used a circumstance a situation
[1:20:30] to teach him notice at the end of days
[1:20:33] i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
[1:20:35] unto heaven
[1:20:36] and my understanding returned unto me
[1:20:39] and i blessed the most high
[1:20:41] and i praised and honored him that
[1:20:43] liveth forever whose dominion is an
[1:20:45] everlasting
[1:20:46] dominion and his kingdom is from
[1:20:48] generation to generation
[1:20:49] it sounds a whole lot different than it
[1:20:51] did at first you know the condition here
[1:20:53] where his eyes
[1:20:54] his eyes were lifted up to heaven and
[1:20:57] all the inhabitants of the earth
[1:20:59] are reputed as nothing and he doth
[1:21:02] according to his will
[1:21:03] in the army of heaven and among the
[1:21:05] inhabitants of the earth
[1:21:06] and none can stay his hand or say unto
[1:21:08] him what doest thou
[1:21:10] at the same time look at this my reason
[1:21:14] his mind returned to him
[1:21:18] he no longer thought of himself then his
[1:21:21] reasoning had returned to him the spirit
[1:21:25] that had come upon him there had been a
[1:21:28] demon
[1:21:28] a spirit bill ben brings it out a spirit
[1:21:31] that had come upon him
[1:21:32] because of this pride but now here
[1:21:35] his reason his understanding the way
[1:21:38] that he would
[1:21:39] look at things now it's coming back but
[1:21:42] in the right
[1:21:43] way my reason returned unto me and for
[1:21:48] the glory of my kingdom
[1:21:49] mine honor and brightness returned unto
[1:21:52] me
[1:21:52] aren't you glad there's things that
[1:21:55] return
[1:21:56] unto you aren't you glad when we get
[1:21:59] we get off in on the wrong thoughts
[1:22:01] about certain things
[1:22:02] aren't you glad for the grace of god
[1:22:04] that's able to cut us down
[1:22:06] and bring us to the place not snuff our
[1:22:08] lives out but bring us to a place
[1:22:10] that there's only one way we can look
[1:22:11] and that's up and we get to look at him
[1:22:13] the right way
[1:22:14] then god says okay now this can return
[1:22:17] unto you
[1:22:18] this can return unto you why it's with
[1:22:21] the full realization
[1:22:22] it comes from him mine honor and
[1:22:26] brightness returned unto me my
[1:22:27] counselors my lord sought that my lord
[1:22:29] sought unto me and i was established in
[1:22:32] my kingdom and excellent majesty was
[1:22:34] added unto me now i nebuchadnezzar
[1:22:37] praise
[1:22:38] and extol and honor the king of heaven
[1:22:41] all
[1:22:42] whose works are truth and his ways
[1:22:45] judgment
[1:22:46] and those that walk in pride he is able
[1:22:50] to abase i want you to watch how brother
[1:22:54] braham takes this here
[1:22:56] of what we just looked at
[1:22:59] it talks about how we see this king he
[1:23:01] got exalted in his heart
[1:23:04] god had to make him eat grass like an ox
[1:23:06] for several years
[1:23:07] how his hair growed out like eagle
[1:23:09] feathers his fingernails like claws of a
[1:23:12] burden
[1:23:13] till the king recognized in his heart
[1:23:17] that he was nothing
[1:23:20] it was the god of heaven who'd set up
[1:23:22] who'd
[1:23:23] set up who he wants to and take down
[1:23:25] when he wants to and many times
[1:23:28] we may not have our hair to grow out
[1:23:30] like eagles feathers
[1:23:31] our fingernails may not grow out like
[1:23:33] eagle's claws
[1:23:34] neither may we eat grass like an ox but
[1:23:37] sometimes
[1:23:38] god has to put affliction on us to let
[1:23:41] us know he's still the ruler of our life
[1:23:44] and we're only here because he permits
[1:23:47] us to be here
[1:23:48] and it's his grace that we are here and
[1:23:51] we
[1:23:52] must serve him
[1:23:56] i'm glad for that aren't you i'm glad
[1:23:59] for the chastening of the lord
[1:24:01] i'm glad for correction because there's
[1:24:04] no doubt about it that throughout this
[1:24:06] building tonight
[1:24:07] and not that we would we don't pride in
[1:24:09] that but thank god
[1:24:10] at times that when god was dealing with
[1:24:12] our life and maybe
[1:24:14] through the cares and things of the
[1:24:15] world or excuses or other matters we
[1:24:18] just kind of pushed it back and
[1:24:20] pushed it back but thank god for his
[1:24:22] mercy because he promised
[1:24:23] he said i'll not lose one of you
[1:24:27] you're my sheep you'll always be my
[1:24:30] sheep
[1:24:32] brother tells a story you're familiar
[1:24:34] with of the of the shepherd
[1:24:36] and here the shepherd was carrying back
[1:24:38] that little lamb that had a broken leg
[1:24:41] and they looked and said what's wrong
[1:24:42] with that lamb was it getting ready to
[1:24:44] jump
[1:24:45] off a cliff and it broke its leg and the
[1:24:48] shepherd said no
[1:24:49] he said i broke its leg you broke its
[1:24:52] leg
[1:24:52] wow you're a cruel shepherd but he said
[1:24:55] no
[1:24:56] he said what it is he says it got to
[1:24:59] relying on its own
[1:25:00] it wouldn't mind me no more but because
[1:25:03] i left it i had to break its leg
[1:25:05] so i could bring it up close to me and
[1:25:07] let it know
[1:25:08] that i love it i care for it that i'm
[1:25:10] the one
[1:25:11] that heals his body i'm the one that
[1:25:13] supplies this life
[1:25:14] i'm telling you friends thank god for
[1:25:17] his mercy
[1:25:18] in our life it's true that not every
[1:25:21] sickness that comes along
[1:25:22] every calamity every sickness and
[1:25:24] calamity it doesn't always deal with
[1:25:26] there being pride in a person's life are
[1:25:29] you with me
[1:25:30] but i'm so thankful that god in his
[1:25:32] mercy
[1:25:33] that when there's things that god could
[1:25:35] see then god could say
[1:25:37] ah i can see maybe getting a little bit
[1:25:39] too much
[1:25:40] you or i would not even be aware of it
[1:25:44] maybe you've been prayed for healed
[1:25:47] prayed for healed
[1:25:48] prayed for healed and then here comes a
[1:25:50] situation you've got to have a surgery
[1:25:52] oh lord what's going on lord i don't
[1:25:54] understand what's going on
[1:25:56] lord why lord jesus you've healed me
[1:25:58] before lord lord what's going on
[1:26:00] and god says i just want to love you a
[1:26:03] little bit
[1:26:05] you see god knows what you and i you and
[1:26:08] i would never consider
[1:26:10] and look in our life there's not one of
[1:26:11] us that would step right out and say
[1:26:13] you know what i've been i'm being real
[1:26:15] prideful lord i'm being prideful i need
[1:26:17] you to come down tonight and i need you
[1:26:18] to whoop me good
[1:26:19] there ain't not there's not one of us
[1:26:22] but you let the word start passing over
[1:26:24] your life
[1:26:25] i'll tell you not only under the
[1:26:26] preaching but i'll tell you when i've
[1:26:28] studied there's things that i look and
[1:26:29] say oh god
[1:26:30] there's things that'll stand right out
[1:26:32] maybe things from the past and
[1:26:34] other things you know i said god what
[1:26:35] does it become it becomes
[1:26:37] discipline guidance correction
[1:26:39] leadership
[1:26:41] for even presently and into the future
[1:26:44] to see god's mercy to our life
[1:26:48] this is god's desire to keep us in that
[1:26:51] place that we
[1:26:52] would not get puffed up is this your
[1:26:54] desire
[1:26:56] lord jesus let me just stay simple lord
[1:26:58] before the word
[1:27:00] let me just lord god i want to be an
[1:27:02] open book you evaluate my life lord
[1:27:04] jesus
[1:27:05] guide and direct me lord speak to my
[1:27:07] heart lord let the word
[1:27:09] let it be a discerner of my life if
[1:27:11] there's something lord god
[1:27:12] to be repented of lord jesus i want to
[1:27:14] repent lord i want everything in my life
[1:27:17] to be
[1:27:18] lined up with you it's a daily
[1:27:21] walk with god this is not a life that we
[1:27:24] can put on autopilot
[1:27:26] or cruise control there'll be times
[1:27:28] you'll have to hit the brakes times
[1:27:30] you're going to have to make a turn
[1:27:31] you cannot make a turn going a fast pace
[1:27:34] there's times you've got to slow down
[1:27:36] you've got to make that turn
[1:27:37] you've got to look at certain things
[1:27:39] that are before you this is where we
[1:27:41] need the grace of god
[1:27:42] in our life
[1:27:46] you see paul himself he spoke
[1:27:49] in concerning his own life he realized
[1:27:53] that that messenger of satan that was
[1:27:55] given to him
[1:27:56] to buffet him why did he say that
[1:27:59] came to him lest i
[1:28:03] be exalted
[1:28:07] here was a man who had seen more
[1:28:12] than what peter and the rest of the
[1:28:15] disciples
[1:28:16] had saw he saw that pillar of fire met
[1:28:21] him
[1:28:22] on the road to damascus
[1:28:25] i want you to think of it in this terms
[1:28:28] if he
[1:28:30] being a prophet messenger and having
[1:28:33] that message that was regarded
[1:28:38] as a minister one who would bring
[1:28:41] that light to the gentiles that same
[1:28:45] gospel that we
[1:28:46] proclaim here tonight but yet when paul
[1:28:49] had asked the lord his eyesight
[1:28:52] would come and go but them said it never
[1:28:55] was the same
[1:28:56] after you saw that pillar of fire it
[1:28:59] would come and go
[1:28:59] you know how you read in the scripture
[1:29:00] paul said you see i wrote to you in
[1:29:02] large
[1:29:03] letters he would pray and pray and ask
[1:29:07] god lord take it from me
[1:29:09] finally after three times the lord told
[1:29:11] me
[1:29:12] paul my grace is sufficient
[1:29:17] for me and paul come to the
[1:29:21] understanding let me just stop here with
[1:29:22] this tonight he came to the
[1:29:24] understanding
[1:29:26] that this is permitted and given to me
[1:29:30] lest i should get exalted
[1:29:34] above the abundance of revelation
[1:29:37] that was given to me if he
[1:29:40] needed that how much more do you and i
