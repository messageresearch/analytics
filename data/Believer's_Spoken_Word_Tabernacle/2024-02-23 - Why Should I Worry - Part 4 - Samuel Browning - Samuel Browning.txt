God father all worries Lord may we lord just here tonight have a fresh vision of you Lord may we see you father Lord a fresh tonight Lord may you Lord God just have your way Lord in this service Lord we just give ourselves Lord to you in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen let's thank you musicians let's turn in our bibles if you would to job 23 and uh you probably already know where we're going now but I I don't want to let that thought uh move by we've where we're drawing this from and then we'll just keep moving but job 23 and verse 13 the scripture said he is of one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence and when I consider I am afraid of him for God made maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face I want to read to you again where I've I've been reading out of this quote I have heard but now I see Bram said job had something wrong with him how many you ever had that something wrong with you something that's just where things just aren't exactly right or just exactly in line absolutely job had something wrong with him but he couldn't get the inspiration on him and it was worrying him and when you get in that kind of a fix that's when the enemy moves into every friend nearly you got amen may God bless you bless the reading of the words you're being seated we've been looking at this here for a few services within that thought of why should I worry and we as we've looked at this and seen this that worry itself it actually doesn't start out as worry it begins just with a concern and a concern itself is totally acceptable there'll be things that we will be concerned with or concerned about and I think there are some things that we can definitely see that are more value as far as to be concerned about than other things and Satan's always busy to try to divert our attention onto the things that really don't even hold as much or the real value not that they can't have value but he would always always is interested in diverting our attention from the things that we need to be the most concerned about and obviously what we is to be the most concerned in our life is that we are where we should be with the Lord and that each and every day that our Liv life is walking daily in step with him it should be the concern of our life and as a Believer when the spirit of God has moved into your heart that's the that the prophet talked about the tension that we have daily is am I pleasing to my Lord so there's a concern about our life so concern itself is not anything that's wrong or that's bad but there's things that I'm sure that every one of us have maybe you're getting ready to go to sleep at night or maybe here you are in the middle of something and you know it seems like it always wants to strike when you're getting down to pray or when you're getting ready to read or when you're getting ready maybe on your way to church and there'll be a concern and and sometimes those concerns are valid concerns but isn't it amazing that those things will always strike you at some of those moments and those times and then you're getting ready to go to sleep at times I'm sure every one of us have had this and you can all of a sudden they'll just be something drop up your mind and it isn't something that is delightful it's something that may be a thought and and you begin to think upon that thought and before you know it where you were tired and ready to go to sleep and you thought praise the Lord I'm getting to bed at a good time tonight it's 11:00 11:30 thank you Lord I'm I'm getting to bed early tonight and then that drops and you're just like there goes any part of going to sleep and we have all come into those moments and times you know and we of course there's ways that the Lord will help us as we can see that there situ ations we can become very worried about and at that time of the night we're not going to solve them we're not going to do anything about it a matter of fact even in 6:00 in the morning we're not going to solve them but it's when we can recognize when those things come that where we go and we take it to the Lord who is over everything in our life I'm glad we've got a place that we can go to in him that he's a strong Refuge that when things like that come when concerns would even move to that of a worry I'm glad there's a place that we can go and let off the pressure because we're not promised that pressure wouldn't come to us we're not promised that we wouldn't experience even worries and that there wouldn't be time where anxiousness and things like that can hit us but we are promised that if we will just have our place in him and let him be the place where we let off the pressure then he will help us he will guide us he will direct us through the entire situation so when we look at this in the script scripture I have been referring to these scriptures over and over out of 2 Timothy 1 and verse 7 and the Bible said for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind so this is what God has given to us anything that comes outside of that of strength of that of God's love of the love of God or that even that of a sound mind of a healthy mind of things that would be sound and temperate anything that comes outside of that did not come from God do you realize that even Paul had to address the Saints in that day that there were those who were somehow taking the word and making it as though events were happening that the coming of the Lord as far as it was on at that time and Paul said let me just assure you that you be not soon shaken in mind as though this letter has come from us so it's always God God's way if you you can understand this that it's always God's way to always bring us to a settling not a a complacency but God's desire is that we would live in a place of real rest in him that it would not be something that where we're struggling but where there is a real rest and a settl that no matter what is taking place all around us we have a place of settl and rest in him so that's something that the gospel will all always try to do in Romans 8:15 here Paul writes for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption or rather that spirit that will bring us to the full maturity of sunship whereby we cry Abba Father in the Mighty God or the mighty conqueror brother BR says he went through the great Veil Yonder of sickness the great veil of sin he he went through the great veil of worry my ain't that something that worry was actually a veil he went through the great veil of fear he tore every one of them down and ascended so high and received the name above every name that's named in the heavens above or in Earth Below or in the world to come and now with that then God has deposited that life back into the believer not the spirit of fear but the spirit of that is of a power God's residing nature that brings a change and a transformation where God's love that is burning within our heart for him to please him and there is a a a a healthiness that comes with his presence living in our life to where it's to bring us back to the place that Adam fell from you know brother B said where Adam Adam and Eve they had a perfect understanding of the love of God they walked with God there was there there was no worry there was no fear there was no sickness none of these things were around them and yet after man fell the prophet said ad man lost all consciousness of what God has put him on Earth to do but through Christ the second Adam we have been restored back to everything that was lost in the fall but the prophet tells us that the things he said that where man even in his his mind it is as it were in his mind the plumbing of his mind has been all plugged up and clogged up that he has forgot and lost all consciousness of this but I'm grateful that you know God has not brought us conscious of it by just giving us a word but God brings us conscious of Who We Are by coming and manifesting his word and making himself known to you and I letting us know of the rights that we have been redeemed back to and this is why the prophet could say God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit and he's depending on you so let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts that's good now we realize that even as it took place in the beginning of how that God has dealt with Satan even when the Rebellion took place in heaven the way that he dealt with him was he cast him out he didn't ask him to leave he cast him out so the way that God deals with Satan is to cast him out and this is exactly then how that we as Sons and Daughters of God are to deal with Satan there's no deals to be made it's to cast him out and it simply begins even with that of our thoughts and of our mind because remember the fall in the beginning Satan could not have got one place or Avenue with Eve if he hadn't been able to get in her mind and she accept what he was saying is that right and that's the same way the new birth comes to you and I it doesn't bypass the mind but it it must be the mind accepts the word because the word has life but then when it comes down and falls down on the inside that's what brings the transformation because it's the word that has life and so notice in 2 Corinthians 10:5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God anything that wants to put itself above God's word what God's thoughts is concerning you cast it down and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ brother BR said in greatest battle or fought how did Grant take Richmond just as he came to it that's how he took rich Richmond and that's how God's soldiers take sin and sickness just as they come to it that's the way they overcome their doubts and fears and things when one Rises they chop him down and say move out of the way right amen now there's things of How It's just to me is absolutely incredible of how that the spirit of God can move down and will bring such an absolute change of a new creation within a life and a heart and then God equips you and I as a son and daughter of God by the new birth and he'll begin to move down into areas of our life that there are things that you and I might still deal with fears and doubts and things and channels that can be in there but the spirit of God will equip us and he'll go right down into areas of our life and when do we go into those areas as we come to it as the spirit of God brings us into those areas and a lot of times as they stick their head up and there's things we come face to face with that's the time to deal with it sometimes there's things we're dealing with that are not present present tense things that's why the prophet over and over I Marvel at how many people were chased by dogs and here there standing 50 years old on the platform and they're dealing with a nervous condition that's beyond normal or where it should be and the spirit of God will call it out and relieve them from that oppression that's been on their life since they was a very young person what is that we deal with it as it comes to light so I'm thankful that that part of it that God has not asked me God has not asked you to go down and try to find everything out in our life we take it as we come to it and that's why it's important we want to be built up in the word of God and when the word says go forward we want to go forward don't pull back that's the time to go forward when when things arise and situations that were brought face to face with and there's things in our life that at that moment it becomes a decision of death and life it becomes a moment to say I am no longer this has surfaced it's time to deal with this area amen now I want to just deal with one of these things here tonight and sometimes we'll be able to go through some more of these things as we come through it but one of the things that we look at that is that can be sometimes the greatest thing or the hardest for anybody is change now I I would go to say that probably most of us in here do not like change in one form or another that's right I mean you know Lord forbid that somebody has your seat you know my goodness or somebody took your parking spot or or or or my goodness you know let's say if You' have come in here and we' have just had things all moved around in here tonight still been in the same Sanctuary but things had been changed around it no doubt would have caught us like well what's going on because there's a part about us that we don't like change is that right there's a trueth now we're all different in that you know there's some people that I mean you know the house could fall down around them it don't matter it don't matter at all then but there are certain things that do matter when certain things would change and you'll know because of the reaction they have regarding certain things and it might be something that you would look at and say what's the big deal I mean what's the big deal I mean there's just the car mat is not in the car I mean or the or the carpet or something's on the carpet or what what's the big deal but you see sometimes we find just even how the peculiarities and how we're made up and how that we would respond to ch and and those different things and you know sometimes change itself can be very scary change is one of those things that sometimes people will look at it and say nope not going to do it at all I know there's even been changes I I've had I've had you know where people have told me oh this change is taking place and you know things are being done different here and my things are a little different at church and this and that my different from how we we're used to it because why change is something that many times it can cause people to worry because we get into our comfort zones and yet the whole of the Christian Life is for us to rest and yet at the same time we are walking daily to be changed in his presence now when we think of this I don't know if you all ever uh had to do there some of you that with within your workplace but I never forget years and years ago there was a h a book that they had us read you know all those things sometimes they drum up to make you feel like they're doing something new it's kind of like what we always called rearranging the chairs on the deck all you've done is rearranged the same old chairs it's oh this is new improved in same chair and different location that's all it is you know a lot of hype to make you think there's change you know but you know when we look at this there was a there was a book I always thought it was kind of you know it's a little short little book they had us read and it was talking about how that change itself is inevitable and it's constant and in every person's life and there's seasons of life and change that takes place and it was about 4 little mice and the whole book was I think the book was called who moved the cheese and it was dealing with there was four little mice and in those those four little mice that were in there you had you had two of those mice that were named Sniff and scurry and you had the other two that was named him and hall now you know every time when cheese would certain things and the cheese was representing certain changes in life jobs relationship money and all those other things like that and as they would they were so used to this pile of cheese but that pile of cheese would all of a sudden as they all ate on it it would just dwindle away but you know Sniff and Scurry would go on and they they'd catch something and man we got to go find some other cheese and it would be different you know they wouldn't be able to go out this crack and find it here and and make this turn here and it's out there on that wall and but but they would go and find it but then you had the other two mice called him and Hall and that's what they did they complained because there was no more cheese right there who you know what's happened here where who changed who changed this what what happened with this cheese and you know it's very much so that when we come into change I I can't help but think about it and I wonder I I was just just meditating on this earlier in the week when I was praying I can't help but wonder if the reason that change itself is so difficult for us is because of the fall in the beginning oh yeah because Adam and Eve there everything there was a constant they were in God's presence they had no worry they had no fear they had no sickness it was a constant constant In God's Presence I cannot help but think that that the effect that we have on our life it's a longing for something that is constant something that cannot be changed let me just say this to you this world is going to continue to change it's going to continue to get worse but there is a rock that you can climb upon that no matter how much change takes place politics and everything else but it is a place that will hold steady it will hold constant and you in your own life and walk with God will not be up and down but it'll hold you steady that's what Christ does yes he does you know no doubt what a look and how that it looked in the beginning and think of how that the love of God so governed their lives but now fear entered they did not know what fear was when all of a sudden to think about it even when you consider when they could hear the Roar and the snarl teeth had been changed on the lion teeth had been changed on the tiger why they did not eat meat but everything with the change and the fall now the lion is going after the lamb now the tiger all of the everything had to be changed and to think of how this has come about what a startling thing that it must have been to see that change now I look at it in this way of how that God himself said in Genesis 3:23 the Lord God sent him forth out of the Garden of Eden to teal the ground from whence he was taken and he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life I'm glad that God has made a way back oh my there was no sickness no sin no worry now notice that within all of this how the prophet says this here and he swore by himself he said there was no sin there was no sickness nothing no worry no nothing no old age no breaking down no heartaches no broken homes no nothing it was just perfect pretty incredible you didn't have to worry about whether you had Tylenol on you didn't have to worry of whether you had Molin in the cabinet or if you've had kidney stones didn't even have to worry whether you had the pain medication in your carry-on bag come on bro so there was no worries at all but now how it enters in because of sin now all of these things come in and we battle against these things time and time again but you know the promise as it lays before us that heaven and Earth shall pass away in Matthew 24:35 but my words shall not pass away so the Earth is not going to pass away but the system that has come upon it because of sin will pass away in Hebrews 1 verse 10 it says thou Lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they shall all wax old as death a garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy years shall not fail so when the fall took place then we find of how the prophet would describe it that the heavens and the atmospheres contaminated with Devils the atmosphere we walked according to the prince and power of the air before spirits and how that remember even when the Lord Jesus was here and he was tempted that even Satan offered him the kingdoms of this world he was tempted to take it without suffering but in order for knowing that as an obedience to the word he was to fall air to that by staying obedient to the word of God and to think that when we look at it it's the system itself that one day will pass away my the Bible tells us in the Millennium that the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth land sea and sky it will fill it in that time of the Millennium then think about it in that time has the Earth itself the things that we see even taking place where the Earth is is moving in such a way of birth pains to give away to to that Civilization that must come in it's this civilization has to die and to think of how that within everything just like in our life there had to come a change on the inside of our life and when that change has taken place inside of our life then everything else that has been packed into us down through life it begins to be unpacked and the grace of God gives us Grace to overcome oh my I think of how the prophet said in the absolute he said I had to be made like this God made me the way he made me with all these no accounts no good qualities so that he could come and dig it all out of me that's great Hallelujah so to think about how the spirit of God moves into our life and as we read here earlier that there is one consonant one one thing that's constant in our life and should be and one thing that has never changed no matter how man has changed but God has never changed God has never changed now when we think of this of how that God himself has never changed and how that God came down to become one of us the the Bible tells us that how that when he gathered with the disciples and I want you to be I want you to be mindful of this of how that God himself Works in our lives with when change is about the worst thing that we could ever do when change and moments of change and transition is to be absent but God shows us how it is through our families through everything that transition itself changing from one to another is so vitally important that's the time where leadership is needed and it's a time that sometimes we can stand around and feel the most helpless but that's the time we need God Amen is that right that's the time we need God in those times of transition now the disciples were just walking around they were confused things did not happen as they thought it should happen that you know things there had been a lot of change come in their life already but yet they had not received that change on the inside yet and they were wondering what was taking place and here the Lord Jesus when he raised there on that Easter morning he goes down and he begins to gather them and begins to express to them the Fulfillment of the word and admonish them of what they are to wait for and he said you shall receive power in Acts 18 after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me and on and on and on throughout all those places he's got witnesses right here tonight in Sheffield he's got witnesses in Lorraine he's got witnesses where you are if you're filled with the spirit of God you are a witness a trophy of God's grace it's a trophy that God keeps his word do you realize what the prophet says in the message absolute that the people that are born of the spirit of God are the absolute of the promise that God has given not that I'm an absolute or you're an absolute but it shows that God's word is in infallible and what God spoke that he gives the holy ghost that he still is a deliverer that God still keeps his word and your life is a testimony of that word yes it is hallelujah now you know one thing that we find when it comes to that of change you know the prophet tells us of how that lives and people will actually pull back and try to dodge the issue of the new birth they don't want to pull back from that that's one area of change and I tell you if there's one thing that we need the most important change that'll ever happen in our life that'll lead us to the next change it'll guide us through every phase and every change in our life changes that we're not even expecting sitting right here tonight there are lives that have experienced change unexpectedly oh I know things can change in just a moment things that we're not even anticipating on but neither but when God doesn't want us to live in a state of fear I'm going to protect this so so this doesn't change no we don't walk like that as Believers that's called worry that'll cause you to go in your house lock yourself away and not come out for nothing but what we are to do is to look to the Lord and say Lord here's my hand Lord I want my hand Lord to be in your hand to guide me every step of the way to know that there's NE nothing can take me from this Earth or any loved one until Lord that time has come and the purpose has been served think of what the prophet says he said concerning if it's your time to go there's not enough doctors surgeons or medicine that can keep you here but if it's not your time to go there's not a sickness big enough there's not a devil or a demon that can take you why we are under the control of our heavenly father our lives are here governed by his grace so we look at this the Bible would speak to us regarding this of the new birth and I you know how that in many instances in many things of how that lives or hearts and people that will actually pull back from that of the new birth then come up just to a certain spot even brother BR we have references from history of Augustine of Hippo where the Holy Ghost came upon him but he resisted it and he turned away from it why because of the change that it would have brought in his life now you would think about just think about this for a minute who would not want to be changed but you see what it is is that with many of the change there are lives and people still want to Reign Over the Holy Ghost but we don't Reign Over the Holy Ghost it's where we come into submission to him and he takes us over it's not us controlling him it's not us picking it out like a value meal I'll take this and this I put N I want that I'll take this and I'll take that that is not how the new birth comes and the new birth is not about everything you can do and you cannot do you're looking at the wrong picture the new birth is about the person of Jesus Christ it's about meeting him in a one-on-one Affair and surrendering your life to him if you look at everything I got to give this up I got to give that up you're looking at the wrong thing you'll never get there like that it is about a union with Jesus Christ and if you can realize that and say oh God let that Revelation strike my heart listen friends if that Revelation is not struck your heart just don't let these Services Go On by but take that in tonight into your heart and say God give me the grace to go beyond the worry of change oh sometimes I wonder you know to get to such a part now I'm just going to speak for me when I was a real young person and I would be you know in meetings oh my the presence of God would be moving but then all of a sudden how Satan knows just how to come and want to water you down what are you going to say when you get back to school what are you going to do when this comes about are you going to quit doing this are you going to ringu are you going to give up playing this are you going to what's going to happen and you know the moment that I entertained that it was like a cooling it would just I know I probably am not the only one you see Satan knows just exactly remember remember when brother bram's uh uh daughter-in-law she says every time I'm praying for the holy ghost at about that time say such a a feeling comes over me and she said you know I I just I get up at that time brother BR said that's the time to stay on your knees that's not the time to pull back just like brother BR says in the Holy Ghost series oh my the the outpouring of the Holy Spirit taking place and there after that third service the porn the spirit of God just moving in the building and brother brand and sister said you know all them people were shouting and rejoicing and said I was getting ready to you know just and she said such a feeling came over me she said I I just you know anyone that she was rejecting the Holy Ghost she just said such a feeling came over me it just just like a coldness brother Ram said that's the time you should have press through and worshiped anyhow hallelujah oh my I'll tell you what friends this is is a moment and an hour to realize feelings we look at oh I don't walk by feelings but many times we do we go by things of feeling so much and Satan knows just how much to bring upon us to kind of settle us down because why he knows that that part is still about us you're not going to strip that part out but you've got to learn to live by the word of God what the word has said about you and bring every thought subject to the word oh my what about my friends what will my friends think what will my family think what will I listen when you can just get a glimpse of the Lord Jesus of what he has done for you the way that he's made for you he's not the second person of the godhead it is God's love expressed to you and me he came down and he paid the ultimate price he laid aside his Splendor he did not even have a place to to lay his head he was willing to be mocked beard pulled he was willing to stand right there in Pilot's judgment Hall and he was willing to take every sin that would ever be Hallelujah and bear it to the lowest parts of hell right I can hear how the prophet says there he was in The Garden of Gethsemane he said like Samson with the arena was all surrounded every demon out of Torment every devil that was all gathered around in that Arena and here they were speaking to him trying to pressure to him but here th the father speaking to him will you go my son will you go and he took that burden for you and I he paid oh my the prophet said he made the sacrifice once and for all for past sin present sin and future sinah Hallelujah he took care of it all he settled the debt right there Hallelujah and sent back the Holy Ghost amen sent it back to call you and I to a place of full surrender oh my the prophet says it like this I'm BR to mve down into that quote it's out of the message why I've got a few there but the one that says the people is just afraid of this new birth she'll find in a minute the people is just afraid of this new birth that's all they're afraid to come to it because it'll straighten them up it'll make them quit playing bingo quit playing these slot machines it'll make you quit staying home on Wednesday night from prayer meeting to watch we love Susi and all those other crazy things that Hollywood has got and them jty dirty jokes they crack over there it'll make you let your hair grow out long it'll make you act like a lady it'll make a man quit smoking cigarettes and being church as deacons it'll make the people quit lying and stealing it'll do something for you it'll clean you up and give you a Salvation that there's nothing in the world can explaining away from you cuz you know you were there when it happened only thing I can say is oh how I wish I had given my life to him sooner Hallelujah 19 years old but oh how when he touched my heart as a 13-year-old boy 10-year-old boy oh how I would have given anything to have went on with him at that time I would have avoided a lot of scars but I'm glad he changed me I'm glad he changed me like brother BR says I didn't join the brandham family I was born into it is that right I didn't join it I was born into it I I didn't get into it by handshake it was a birth I was birthed into it is that right you know and this is the thing that the Bible tells us in Revelations 21:8 but the fearful that's worrying and unbelieving and abominable and murders and Horn mongers and S Sorcerers idolators and Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death let me just say it like this that those that even know what's right but fearful to put their hand to it that's how important this is but you see the way change change his heart God begins to deal with a heart in a life and he does not God does not draw Us by threatening us that's not how he works the love of God moves down to draw and to woo us if you look back in Genesis 1 that's exactly how the spirit of God brings you and I to birth God speaks his word and the spirit of God comes out across the Earth and it begins to coup over that Earth making love to it and what's he doing he's bringing forth the conditions that's needed where that Darkness will be driven away so that the light itself can penetrate down there to that seed I'm sure that you feel the same way I do Lord I don't want to be held back from anything that you have for me let me just tell you something God's already exhibited all of his grace he's exhibited his Mercy all everything he thinks about you God has made it known oh it's a time to take hold of that promise and say Lord you are all that I need to guide me into this complete change you know the beautiful thing about it is is that when as as as we come into him it changes us sometimes you know it where where the change takes place is down on the inside our desires are changed the nature is changed and and then from that little deposit of his Spirit it begins to change us from Glory unto Glory Samuel what are you saying that you're not born fully matured we're not born fully matured but we receive the spirit of adoption that produces or leads to full sunship is that right that's that those are th that that's the scripture so we find that that that takes place in our life and to think about it even after the spirit of God will move down into the depths of our life as we are being changed from Glory unto Glory there are things that sometimes it's just hard right my I'm I guess I'm the only one in here there's some things that's just hard some things we'll look at and we'll think uh you know I Lord I'm not disagreeing but I don't know about right now and God will bring it out again sometimes it comes through tests comes through Tri comes to because listen obedience is not easy brother samel I want scripture glad you asked let me just call it to mind Hebrews 5:7 he was heard with strong tears and crying in that he feared he learned obedience by the things he suffered there listen we sat here we agree with the word but then when tests and Trials come where we have to take the word and as author of a son and daughter of God and Reign Over Our Own will reign over our own life it takes the grace of God it's not something that just all of a sudden remember character is not a gift that's right it's a victory the Holy Ghost is the gift of God the character is not a gift that's right character is a victory that has been won now I want you to think of this even when it comes to moments and times when change is taking place as we said it can be very difficult we've seen it even when the Lord Jesus would stand there before the Pharisees remember they thought they remember what they thought concerning the Lord Jesus they thought he was coming to do away or to take away from the law they they they looked at it what this man is doing he's blaspheming they thought the same thing about Paul anytime there is an advancement in the word of God it brings worrying oh yes that's why the prophet could say in the message the birth pains he could say concerning worrying anytime there's a transformation from the old to the new where the life is at that's what was worrying the people and it worries them yet today why when even as the word even the message that we are following in this hour we have not it's not an encampment that we build an encampment and there's no moving no no everything we believe we must have a comma after it we must say we believe this and all that God will continue to reveal as a matter of fact I just read and posted some of these things today of how that the prophet said a prophet is the word he is a Divine interpreter of the word and his interpretation of the word must not be mingled with that's so good oh I don't know about this you know I think you know brother random was you know I didn't have much understanding I I'm going to go to have to go out here nope nope we're not mingling with the interpretation we have receed the perfect interpretation by Divine Vindication doesn't matter who it is what their name is when you depart from the word I'm staying with this word no alterations we're staying with the word that God has revealed and Vindicated in this hour it is the sure ticket out of here because it is God's word that has been delivered and the spirit of God brings it into the lives of the people but it gets worrisome I mean you can even when you sometimes you know you can preach on Grace and sometimes you can become worrisome like oh oh oh no the the you know the the people are going to become loose hey look I I didn't put that in the scripture God put that in there and let me just tell you something if there's already something in the heart that's not right it'll find a way to do it anyhow but let me just tell you right now this guy right here you're never going to perfect him we're going to need the grace of God to the very last Nano second before we're changed we we need the grace of God daily in our life and we need that Grace to lead us so that we can reflect in our own life and see our shortcomings and die daily oh my many things remember even when Peter said there were things that was hard Paul has said some things that hard to be UND misund to be understood that right it was hard for him it was hard did Peter understand it all he did not but Peter understood what was most important Paul is the messenger of the age and Paul is the Apostle to the Gentiles just as much as Peter could recognize he was the Apostle to the Jews he didn't understand everything remember Peter got rebuked he went down there you know and you know he he got a taste of ribs and you know bacon and man that was good I mean what what he had been missing all them years but all of a sudden some brothers came over the hill Oh Lord have mercy he said quickly get this barbecue sauce away from me get this away from me you know he he want to distance himself you know why he wasn't settled but Paul was settled and the Bible says Paul withstood him to his face why because that in your actions can upset the rest of the Believers oh my changes hard isn't it sure it's hard change is hard but notice this there are certain changes let me try to bring this down into here there are changes in life and Seasons you know that we come into and I'm thankful for God's grace in our lives that he will lead us through these seasons and these times in our life there's seasons and changes that we don't have a choice to bypass but God's grace is present to see us through notice in the message indictment the brother Ram says the human being has two changes of Life they have the change from a boy to a man from a girl to a woman about 16 17 years old they get a bunch of just fly by nights and if you can just suffer with them during that age probably put it in parenthesis and not kill them if you can suffer with them why what's causing this they're going through a change right they're going through a change the sad part about it is is sometimes the adults are not settled enough to help them through the change yes sir friends I can't think of no better no better way to be settled than to be in Christ amen because I'll be the first to tell you even when it come to my own boys I didn't have all the answers oh my I remember when I first started pastoring I remember when I first got married I thought man I had to have all the answers I created so much undue stress on myself until I realized I don't have to have all the answers I just got to know him who is the answer stay in contact with him he will give me the answer just as I have need of it he'll be able to direct me and guide me brother Samuel do you worry about it I don't worry about it there's things yes that I'll pray in being concerned and looking to God In Prayer but you know what God has never failed to give the leadership that's needed so look at this if you can suffer with them during that age now remember brother Ram talks about that even with regard regard to Becky and everything else and brother Ram now you notice even in this part right here with Becky you know brother George would go into this brother Bram talks about it but even brother George would go into this of how that brother Bram when he went down the street and he asked he asked Where's Becky at well she's down at the neighbor's house down there this when they lived in Tucson she's down there well brother Bram wanted to go to dinner so here here is here is you know brother Bram Sister Sister M you know and Joseph and and Sarah there in the car and so he pulls up and he goes he's walking up to the door and as he's walking up to the door he's hearing rock and roll music wow now to me these are things when I when I hear cuz I can read it I can read it but some of these details I wouldn't know if brother George hadn't mentioned it but brother Brandon when he went up to the door he just simply knocked on the door they came to it and he said it's time to go it's time for us to eat he didn't not make a scene about it he didn't even make a scene in the car nor over dinner it's quiet in here now ain't it remember what brother Bram said concerning that he did talk to her later but brother Bram said he felt like taking his belt out but he realized that'll not do any good you've got to think 18-year-old thoughts and you know why brother B reminded sister mey you with is a moment if she was dying the next moment we've got a committer to the Lord I tell you to me I'm thankful to God for for these examples that are included in here is that right I mean think about it you think the enemy didn't try to attack attack brother Ram's mind I I I don't know but you think it didn't because I know he's human just like us you think he didn't try to attack his mind you the prophet of God and look at your daughter look at you look at this you know sometimes the sad part about it is is when parents will correct their children out of embarrassment instead of out of the heart in mind that's so good my that's that that's that's a family service thing notice he said that I've got a daughter about that age right now Rebecca pray for Billy oh every one of us we come through that little frantic age and we must suffer with them realizing it's something that they have to go through now he says now Edith remember he's talking about sister Edith right he said little Edith remember she was with that infertile paralysis 7 years she's changing of seven years every seven years your life changes so the 7even time 7 you see it makes it kind of hard and that's a complete change she was going to be 49 it bothers the women men usually get kind of funny and carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives but women are unfertile after that and we can we go through all of that and we must remember that it's things we must bear with one another and understand understand those things change remember Rockefeller didn't want to do with he didn't want to deal with that change with his wife he just left yes he did and here's the miracle understanding don't even mean you understand it just means you listen and say okay right okay okay like another dish of ice cream I mean not for my wife you like another okay it doesn't mean that I you know because sometimes as as men we've got to have everything figured out tell me all your problems I'll solve them all don't work like that oh my notice how the prophet in this time of of total Deliverance I've read this quote to you many times brother R talking about sister Neville Brandon go down in that quote of total Deliverance where he says may your spirit Lord may your spirit Lord be great upon her he's praying for sister Neville knowing that all women are ordained to walk down through this valley of darkness of this age but we pray that you'll be with her bless those little children she'll be nervous now and fretful but may the Holy Ghost be at the door of Mercy at all times for that family questions and answers 1964 he said a woman here might be in the menopause time that's when everything is wrong with her I don't know if I should read this next part and there's nothing wrong with her yet everything's wrong with her and she's not just putting on she really feels that it's just as real any person that's nervous is that way and don't never disagree right what counsel that's right you say Brother Sam you're talking about changes of Life remember the Lord Jesus did not abandon his disciples in the transition of change changing from the old to the new he does not abandon when it comes time for his children to move on in the word he's right there he's the one that stabilizes us he's the one that when questions rise remember when Jack Cole Jack Cole was sitting on the platform heard about brother R and here he is sitting there and Jack Cole had a lot of questions in his heart but Jack Cole seemed the operation of the supernatural he saw a Living God on display and even as the prophet would walk on by him and speak to him personally it changed him it changed what he was thinking it changed how Jack Cole was seeing things think of how many that even think of how when this message come listen friends this message when it come think when brother Bram stands there and he preaches very key messages on return and Jubilee in streetport 1962 then he turns around the next night the way back and he's preaching that and a and a brother you hear the brother come up to the microphone after returning Jubilee oh we've got to get back to how it was we've got to get back he's referring to Zeus stre they know they had fallen from somewhere and here God is present there in the ministry and the Fulfillment of his word to lead his children yes from that of isua Street that's right into the bride age that's right he doesn't ask us to do it on our own Hallelujah because isus is the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming upon that the baptism of the spirit but remember we are to receive the adoption which is the fullness of Christ tabernacling in a bride body where there is a Mount Transfiguration experience glory be to God that's what this message is about this is why that even through the times when the prophet could say burn that old Li with fire you can't bring he said that Pentecostalism over in here you've got to burn it with fire brother brandom was not against emotion he was not against gift he was not against shouting but he was letting the people know you can have all of that and miss the real thing and if you've got the real thing you might shout and you might not you might speak with tongues and you might not but there's one thing you will you will live a life that's worthy of the Gospel you will live a life let me tell you something you might never preach might never sing you may not even have been able to say I don't even know if I've been able to lay my hands on somebody and pray and theyd be healed but you have one of the greatest realities and that is to be able to obey the word of God from a heart on the inside that says amen Lord remember God's got people in the body for every little thing yeah amen he don't want us all we don't need to all do the same thing this is why I think it was uh um I think it was Sister Florence sharan brother BR I prayed and fasted so much and I tried to cast out Devils brother BR said that wasn't your position sister your position is to pray and fast God's got somebody else to cast them out Lord how did we get here and you husbands to your wife let's continue that next part when they're in that time of life is if she ever was your sweetheart let her be right then cuz she needs you now when I'm reading this I want you to think of the Lord Jesus concerning your life and my life when there's seasons of change that we are going through that even when we can say I don't know about this Lord I don't know about this but he's right there with us because he's the one that begins to open us to change he's the one that begins to move on our hearts to accept remember before elzar ever got to the well the angel of the Lord beat the servant there a half hour and dealt with Rebecca's heart and said go get some water it's God dealing on both ends she really needs your help she needs somebody to help her and understand her talk to her take her up in your arms like she was your sweetheart she should be understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup is changing and you must be good to her at that time I think of how brother Brandon would would say it I I've got it here but I this time I don't have time to read it but how brother Brandon would speak of it about how that many of the sisters he said look he said when you're going through that time he said don't take them hormone shots he said that's the thing that causes cancer and he said I know he said because I've caught it in the prayer lines so I thought here you know one evening and I said I'm just going to look that up because I've always seen that I've seen everything where the Prophet has said you'll see the things they're finding out sure enough American Cancer Society has all of this listed of those things but I love how the prophet just you know he makes it so clear he said just always remember he's right there to take your hand at that time lot of things of uncertainty and change and things that can come around within our life but those those shadows and darkness and things that can come about our lives he's standing right there watching us and nothing can harm us let's stand I think about this time that here we are all of them Through the Ages have looked for this the hour that you and I are living in they've waited on this moment and we know we're living in a time or at any moment you can look around and our loved ones are going to be appearing before us the move is on there's a stirring in our hearts it's God is present right now just as he was to lead them to the day of Pentecost that same God is here present in a people to lead us into a body ch change these promises have laid down Through the Ages but to think how that a prophet would stand there and tell us to me to be so clear and honest with us and say I was always afraid of dying before I had that vision of the other side he said not not afraid of that I'd be lost I was't afraid of that he said I wasn't afraid that I'd be lost he said but what it is I didn't want to be a spirit I didn't want to just be floating around and but how the Lord came to him that morning and took him beyond the curtain of time and let him see it's not Spirits they're bodies they're in a body just as like you and I can look invisible and see one another that's how they are over there they've already entered into their Theo that's right and and you know what it wasn't a long journey it was just one step one moment that Dimension as the prophet would say it he said it's just a higher sense he said as he moves down he says you just move into that higher sense into that other realm it's right here with us already so it's not something that's far off it's right here and the presence of God has come to lead us in change now I'd say tonight that's the greatest thing we can make preparation for if you haven't is to let him come tonight and change your life you know even right now with what maybe you're dealing with or looking at he'll come right into your situation and Lead You yes he will through the change that's before you will yes sir I'm sure every one of us there's things maybe you've experienced experience right now maybe things that we'll experience in coming years coming our coming days that's not planned but the presence of God will help us God will give us Grace and lead us in that moment of change that's who
