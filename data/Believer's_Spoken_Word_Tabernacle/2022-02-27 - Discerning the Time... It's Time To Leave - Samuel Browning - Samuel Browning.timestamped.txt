[40:34] maybe friday evening here for us
[40:36] and there's been there's been many but
[40:38] i'm just going to read these particular
[40:40] two
[40:40] and this is one from marapol
[40:43] there in ukraine it says shalom dear
[40:45] brothers the city is now surrounded
[40:48] today or tomorrow it seems they will be
[40:50] taking the city military operations

[40:58] atms and gas stations thank you very
[41:01] much for the support
[41:03] i want you to what listen these these
[41:04] statements this isn't our war
[41:07] but we are their target and we have thus
[41:10] saith the lord to be strong and mighty
[41:12] in the faith of the fathers also with
[41:15] his precious presence and that is
[41:17] everything for us
[41:19] we pray about innocent people and those
[41:21] in the bride who are in these
[41:23] circumstances and we pray for wisdom of
[41:26] what to do in these conditions we are
[41:27] ready to help if anyone here is in need
[41:31] right now so this was one in maripole
[41:33] this is the
[41:34] more towards the western southwestern
[41:36] part of ukraine so he's writing to the
[41:38] other brothers that are there and that's
[41:40] why he's saying if we are ready to help
[41:43] if anyone here is in need right now we
[41:46] read what they're doing right now as we
[41:48] read and discuss the messages with the
[41:50] family praying and fellowshipping which
[41:52] is essential needs in our minds
[41:55] may god be with us he's our anchor
[41:57] god keep you also we cherish you and
[41:59] love you and then brother barry had also
[42:03] forwarded this one
[42:04] this morning just trying to keep all of
[42:06] us up to date
[42:07] and that
[42:09] from some of the believers in the
[42:10] country
[42:12] brother eugene and his wife brother
[42:14] eugene's an interpreter there and he was
[42:16] he's writing kiev i hope i think i got
[42:19] that pronounced correctly
[42:21] they are surrounded by
[42:23] terrifying news but they are choosing to
[42:25] have short prayer meetings with other
[42:27] believers close by over their phones
[42:29] they're actively encouraging each other
[42:31] especially the sisters among them
[42:34] everyone's ordered off the streets until
[42:35] 8 a.m tomorrow and everything is closed
[42:37] and quiet at the moment shops are
[42:39] completely empty
[42:41] they realize this is not their battle
[42:42] but the battle is the lords and they are
[42:44] confident of his presence among them
[42:47] the economy is destroyed and even for
[42:49] february they only receive 10 of their
[42:51] pay for the whole month
[42:53] anyway and so
[42:56] uh there's um
[42:59] we've tried to get funds in there and so
[43:01] there's been testing to try to get funds
[43:04] we could get it into the believers and
[43:06] uh it's just some of the
[43:08] things right now is you know trying to
[43:10] find ways around things
[43:13] but there are
[43:15] a number of believers
[43:17] that are in there and you know the other
[43:19] day
[43:20] as i'm just thinking about these things
[43:24] i just couldn't help but think of the
[43:26] mercy of god
[43:28] of how that when you look
[43:30] of how that
[43:33] when all that broke that union of the
[43:35] soviet union in 1989
[43:38] then you many of you are aware here from
[43:40] this assembly and i think sister chrissy
[43:42] you're right there from bcf
[43:44] you're very much aware that
[43:46] god took men like brother lonnie jenkins
[43:49] and um
[43:51] brother eugene braun
[43:53] and brother jason watkins also was with
[43:55] him brother berry coffee was very
[43:57] instrumental brothers that went into
[43:59] these countries
[44:00] when everything broke
[44:02] and went in and brought the message in
[44:04] there
[44:06] and
[44:07] you know i can remember st setting in a
[44:09] family camp and i believe it was 2006
[44:13] when brother uh barry was mentioning of
[44:16] how the time remember they were trying
[44:17] to get the message hubs or a printing
[44:20] station so you can
[44:21] download the material without having to
[44:23] ship things in and the objective that
[44:26] burden at that time brother bisco had
[44:28] that burden to get that in there to
[44:30] where they could print the messages and
[44:32] this is anywhere in the world there's
[44:33] print stations all over
[44:35] but it was with that burden i remember
[44:37] brother barry making the statement he
[44:38] said we don't know how long that's going
[44:40] to stay open so they the believers we
[44:42] want to get these things in there
[44:44] so before it gets closed off
[44:46] and so
[44:48] i tell you what the message itself
[44:51] you're not going to stop the message
[44:52] from getting
[44:54] to every one of god's children
[44:56] there will not be one elect seed of god
[45:00] miss it
[45:04] because from one election is it is for
[45:06] the word to have failed
[45:08] and the word cannot fail
[45:10] the word cannot fail
[45:12] though heavens and earth pass away but
[45:14] my word shall never fail
[45:17] so we want to as we prepare to look into
[45:19] the word of the lord this morning we
[45:21] want to
[45:23] have have special prayer for the
[45:25] brothers and sisters there
[45:27] in ukraine
[45:28] and that god would just be merciful and
[45:31] just continue to give them strength and
[45:33] just to continue to
[45:35] pray for them throughout
[45:37] the time as well
[45:40] the other thing is i want you to
[45:43] keep in mind sister i want to give you
[45:45] an update here
[45:46] on
[45:47] sister linda my my aunt linda
[45:50] on thursday we
[45:52] she called me and i got a call that had
[45:54] come in and
[45:56] you remember she had went back into the
[45:57] icu she was there were some some
[46:00] difficulties some things that there was
[46:01] having
[46:02] and so she
[46:04] on thursday had had been released from
[46:06] the icu she's back into a normal room
[46:09] and uh she called me and i was a little
[46:11] shocked because i've just been trying
[46:12] just sending texts and i'll say this to
[46:15] you
[46:15] um she can't really you know it's kind
[46:18] of maybe a little difficult to respond
[46:20] to text but it means so much seeing a
[46:22] text coming from you
[46:24] in that time just an encouraging word
[46:27] you know maybe a husband and wife alike
[46:29] or just sending a text you know just say
[46:32] sister we love you we pray for you you
[46:34] know that's just ammunition against the
[46:35] devil
[46:36] and so it just means a lot so
[46:39] we just had prayer there on thursday in
[46:42] the afternoon here before service and
[46:44] the prince of the lord just came in a
[46:45] really wonderful way
[46:47] and i want to just continue to hold her
[46:49] up in prayer that god will just continue
[46:52] to strengthen her
[46:53] and
[46:54] i know there's many other there's other
[46:56] needs here that is among us as well and
[46:58] we want to be mindful of that in this
[47:00] hour
[47:01] as well that god just continue to pray
[47:04] for one another
[47:05] amen this is a this is a real moment uh
[47:08] real time that we're in and
[47:11] so if we could let's just stand before
[47:13] we read the word and if we could let's
[47:15] just join our hearts together in prayer
[47:18] amen not only over the service but let's
[47:21] pray for the brothers and sisters there
[47:22] in ukraine i know it's been mentioned
[47:24] already once here this morning

[51:45] we pray that you'll just move in a very
[51:47] special way now lord we love you and we
[51:50] thank you father in jesus name
[51:52] amen and amen
[51:54] amen let's turn to first thessalonians
[51:57] chapter 4.
[52:07] i know we were right in the middle of
[52:09] where we were at last week
[52:11] honest reflections but i just
[52:14] just
[52:15] putting it before the lord was ready to
[52:18] go move with those things but i'm just
[52:20] just feeling so pressed just to
[52:23] speak to the church here just a few
[52:25] moments and
[52:26] just to exhort us even in the time that
[52:28] we're living in not that any message
[52:30] doesn't but just to be very
[52:32] very particular here
[52:34] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13
[52:39] but i would not have you ignorant
[52:41] brethren concerning them which are
[52:44] asleep
[52:46] that you sorrow not even as others which
[52:49] have no hope
[52:50] for if we believe that jesus died and
[52:53] rose again again even so them also which
[52:56] sleep in jesus will god bring with him
[53:00] for this we say unto you by the word of
[53:02] the lord now notice what authority is
[53:04] coming here we're saying this to you by
[53:06] the word of the lord
[53:11] that we which are alive and remain unto
[53:14] the coming of the lord
[53:16] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[53:19] for the lord himself shall descend from
[53:22] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[53:24] the archangel
[53:26] and with the trump of god and the dead
[53:28] in christ shall rise first
[53:31] then we which are alive and remain
[53:34] shall be caught up
[53:36] together with them in the clouds to meet
[53:39] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[53:43] be
[53:44] with the lord
[53:46] wherefore
[53:48] comfort one another
[53:50] with these
[53:52] words
[53:54] i want to just just look at this take
[53:57] that that word comfort one another
[54:00] with these
[54:01] words
[54:02] and that word comfort means to address
[54:05] one to speak to one
[54:08] uh to exhort to entreat one
[54:11] and earn which is an earnest and humble
[54:13] request so
[54:15] it's this this comforting is also to
[54:18] me there's a request that's being made
[54:20] to console
[54:22] also to encourage and strengthen by
[54:24] consolation
[54:25] to comfort and be comforted
[54:28] and i just like to say it in this way if
[54:30] i can just say it like this
[54:33] comfort one another with these
[54:35] vindicated words
[54:38] the message of the hour
[54:41] these words the promise that we are
[54:43] partakers of his coming he is our
[54:46] strength he is the standard of our life
[54:49] which is the thunder against the enemy
[54:53] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[54:55] of the words you're being seated
[55:00] sorry to have you up and down
[55:06] but i want to just
[55:08] speak here just this morning here and
[55:10] just try to move along as much as i can
[55:15] but i would like to speak
[55:17] on discerning the time
[55:19] and then also continuing that part it's
[55:21] time to leave
[55:24] discerning the time
[55:26] and it's time to leave
[55:28] now in psalms 27 i'm going to read from
[55:31] there go right to their
[55:32] next because when brother branham would
[55:35] take the text for the message the
[55:37] rapture
[55:39] what we just read in 1st thessalonians 4
[55:43] is the rapture
[55:45] is the event
[55:47] and i want to just say it in this way
[55:50] that the rapture itself
[55:52] is not a day
[55:54] it's not a moment
[55:56] it's a cycle
[55:57] right
[55:59] it's a it is it is not something we are
[56:02] waiting on we are waiting on the climax
[56:06] and the finality of it
[56:08] because the rapture itself
[56:11] is on yes amen
[56:13] god is sent a word in this hour to
[56:18] gather the people unto himself
[56:21] to bring deliverance in lives
[56:24] where our lives that were once bound and
[56:28] subject to that of sin and that of that
[56:31] first birth but god has sent a word to
[56:34] call us in rapture to call us out of
[56:38] that into a real
[56:40] living experience
[56:51] and say we've entered into that cycle
[56:55] the seventh church age is still going on
[56:59] is that right
[57:00] but the bride is caught up into heavenly
[57:03] places
[57:04] the bride is the promise of what god has
[57:08] said to him that overcome yes so god
[57:17] psalms 27
[57:19] let's look here and when brother branham
[57:20] would read this he this is the text he
[57:22] would take for the rapture and brother
[57:25] brandon would refer to this this text
[57:27] right here
[57:28] as some as some background and i want to
[57:31] just deal with that a little bit on some
[57:33] background
[57:34] and and so when we look at this in
[57:36] psalms 27 we're going to read the
[57:38] background for the rapture
[57:41] notice a psalm of david
[57:43] the lord is my light and my salvation
[57:47] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[57:50] strength of my life of whom shall i be
[57:53] afraid
[57:54] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[57:57] foes came upon me to eat my flesh they
[58:01] stumbled and fell
[58:04] though a host shouldn't camp against me
[58:07] now notice verse three this is getting
[58:09] into personal battles
[58:11] personal attacks
[58:13] my heart shall not fear amen
[58:18] the war should arise against me in this
[58:22] will i be
[58:24] confident
[58:26] one thing have i desired of the lord and
[58:30] that will i seek after
[58:32] that i may dwell in the house of the
[58:34] lord all the days of my life to behold
[58:37] the beauty of the lord and to inquire in
[58:40] his temple
[58:42] for in the time of trouble
[58:44] he shall hide me i want you to notice
[58:46] this here in verse 5. that's good for in
[58:48] the time of trouble
[58:50] he
[58:51] shall
[58:52] hide me
[58:54] this is not me hiding myself he shall
[58:57] hide me
[59:00] in his pavilion
[59:03] in the secret of his tabernacle
[59:06] shall he
[59:08] hide me he shall set me upon a rock
[59:13] and now
[59:15] shall my head be lifted up above my
[59:17] enemies round about me therefore will i
[59:20] offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[59:23] joy i will see you i will sing praises
[59:28] unto the lord
[59:29] now i want to just just take here as a
[59:32] background when we look at that thought
[59:34] and you know
[59:36] no doubt when brother brown preached
[59:38] that message how many thought
[59:41] that maybe he should have taken the text
[59:43] from first thessalonians
[59:50] corinthians chapter 15.
[59:53] but you see
[59:54] when we know that those are glorious
[59:57] glorious events and the promise of the
[1:00:00] changing of the body
[1:00:02] but to see the background of things that
[1:00:05] would be taking place within that time
[1:00:07] and i want you to keep in your mind
[1:00:09] discerning the time
[1:00:11] the background itself
[1:00:13] you know is the area or the scenery
[1:00:15] behind a main object
[1:00:18] it usually frames it in
[1:00:21] and it's also
[1:00:23] the background is is also the part of a
[1:00:25] picture or design that serves as a
[1:00:28] setting to the main figures or object
[1:00:31] but it appears the furthest from view
[1:00:34] it's also
[1:00:35] a circumstances or a situation
[1:00:38] prevailing at a particular time or
[1:00:41] underlying a particular event
[1:00:44] so the background most of us everybody
[1:00:46] here has seen a picture
[1:00:48] and where you there might be a main
[1:00:51] main
[1:00:52] object on that picture maybe it's a
[1:00:54] horse or horses and a pasture but you
[1:00:57] see the pasture would be the setting the
[1:00:59] trees behind it is the that's the
[1:01:01] background but the horses is what the
[1:01:04] focus is
[1:01:05] but you see when we're looking at this
[1:01:07] we recognize that the background itself
[1:01:10] is not the main object of focus
[1:01:13] but it rather the background is just
[1:01:15] it's the scenery it's the setting the
[1:01:18] circumstances that are prevailing at
[1:01:21] that time are not the focus they are
[1:01:24] just part of the background of what's
[1:01:27] taking place
[1:01:29] so when we look at end time conditions
[1:01:32] that have been prophesied through the
[1:01:35] word of god
[1:01:36] and we see it all the way down that has
[1:01:38] been typed out what has been lived now
[1:01:41] and when we find ourselves very much in
[1:01:44] a time
[1:01:45] when as it was in the resurrection of
[1:01:48] the lord jesus and he would come to his
[1:01:51] disciples when they were in a state of
[1:01:53] bewilderment they did not know what was
[1:01:55] taking place they didn't know what had
[1:01:57] happened their thoughts about things had
[1:01:59] been you know
[1:02:01] it wasn't happening the way they thought
[1:02:03] it ought to happen but he came and he
[1:02:06] began to draw near unto them as he was
[1:02:09] speaking and they were talking about him
[1:02:11] and what he began to do was he listened
[1:02:14] to them and he began then to unfold to
[1:02:17] them the events to them that they could
[1:02:20] not understand that were taking place
[1:02:22] but he begin to place them that the
[1:02:24] things that are happening are not out of
[1:02:27] order it might be out of the order of
[1:02:29] your thinking but it's not out of order
[1:02:32] as a matter of fact he goes back and he
[1:02:34] starts clear with with moses and he
[1:02:37] brings it all the way up through the
[1:02:38] psalms and to the prophets because to
[1:02:41] show them that the events taking place
[1:02:44] those modern events they're made clear
[1:02:46] by prophecy and it is that god keeps and
[1:02:49] watches over and fulfills every one of
[1:02:52] his word and i i look at it within this
[1:02:55] hour when i think of that scripture of
[1:02:57] luke 24 we are in an hour in a moment in
[1:03:01] a time
[1:03:02] where there has been a resurrection out
[1:03:05] of darkness
[1:03:08] where they wanted to put him away and
[1:03:10] you know seal him away and steal away
[1:03:12] his presence and close off the holy
[1:03:15] ghost but he has resurrected he has come
[1:03:18] forth according to his promised word and
[1:03:20] he has drawn near to begin to declare
[1:03:23] the things that we see in this hour in
[1:03:26] this time we're not out of line we're
[1:03:28] not out of hand it's right in line with
[1:03:31] where we ought to be
[1:03:33] and god in this hour would come through
[1:03:35] a veil remember moses came the first
[1:03:38] time with the ten commandments he was
[1:03:40] now
[1:03:41] the second time he came down he was
[1:03:43] bailed with the veil over showing the
[1:03:45] word would return once again in the end
[1:03:50] and the bible would say in this hour of
[1:03:53] how that it is it is there to receive a
[1:03:56] prophet in the name of the prophet
[1:03:58] the characteristic god identifies
[1:04:01] himself with his prophets by bringing
[1:04:04] his word or making that word to come to
[1:04:07] pass and be visible through that life so
[1:04:10] to receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:04:12] prophet is to receive a prophet's reward
[1:04:15] but what's a prophet's reward you say to
[1:04:17] me a friend of a prophet it is to
[1:04:19] receive life amen because the prophet
[1:04:23] himself remember the church is where
[1:04:26] it'll take people from the true life but
[1:04:29] you see god sends a prophet
[1:04:31] with the word of the lord you know
[1:04:34] israel they had the law but they had not
[1:04:36] the word of the
[1:04:38] lord for god would send the prophet with
[1:04:41] that saith the lord the word of the lord
[1:04:43] and he would not be pointing them to
[1:04:45] something new but he would be calling
[1:04:47] them
[1:04:48] uh he would be calling them just give me
[1:04:51] this right here or give me go get me the
[1:04:56] please
[1:04:57] oh my cut me right in stride
[1:05:00] that's all right
[1:05:03] but god would send a prophet with the
[1:05:05] word of the lord and that prophet would
[1:05:08] come with thus saith the lord and
[1:05:10] identify
[1:05:12] right now this is the hour this is the
[1:05:15] season and would call the people back to
[1:05:19] the original call them back to where
[1:05:21] they drifted from you see this is why
[1:05:23] you need a prophet because a person can
[1:05:25] carry the bible but they can drift from
[1:05:28] the original life of the lord jesus
[1:05:31] christ god sends a prophet and god
[1:05:34] himself steps down in that gift to
[1:05:36] manifest that promise that he is still
[1:05:39] the same yesterday today and forever you
[1:05:42] say why is that necessary there are
[1:05:44] promises that pertain to you and i and
[1:05:47] we need to have a certainty when we
[1:05:50] approach the promises of god that what
[1:05:53] god has said god will make good upon
[1:05:56] every promise we're not here under a
[1:05:58] hope so maybe so we're here under the
[1:06:01] certainty and banner of the holy spirit
[1:06:08] notice what his end time conditions
[1:06:11] noah's day
[1:06:12] the conditions there were conditions
[1:06:15] background that surrounded in noah's day
[1:06:18] while the ark was being built
[1:06:21] while the entrance into the ark the
[1:06:23] place of safety
[1:06:25] these were in time these were conditions
[1:06:28] that would be repeated here
[1:06:30] at the end time
[1:06:31] beauty of women
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:36] eating and drinking now let me just
[1:06:37] pause here just a moment
[1:06:39] you know it's within a woman to want to
[1:06:41] be beautiful
[1:06:44] come on god put that in there
[1:06:48] but satan likes to take that thirst and
[1:06:52] pervert it
[1:06:55] are you with me
[1:06:56] you see look at it in type of the church
[1:06:59] the bible you know covers her in
[1:07:00] revelation 17 the church as a woman
[1:07:04] and see here she she's covered but yet
[1:07:07] she's not covered
[1:07:09] when the word comes it uncovers all of
[1:07:12] the garments and the clothing and the
[1:07:14] religious attire it uncovers and shows
[1:07:17] really she's naked
[1:07:21] and to be naked is to be out from under
[1:07:23] the blood out from under the word
[1:07:26] is that right
[1:07:28] so when we we see this the noah's
[1:07:31] conditions
[1:07:32] in this in this time that we're
[1:07:34] surrounding beauty of women
[1:07:36] eating and drinking
[1:07:42] and you see
[1:07:44] with eating and drinking there's nothing
[1:07:45] wrong with eating the right things right
[1:07:48] you might need a little too much
[1:07:50] but you understand
[1:07:54] drinking everybody's got to do those
[1:07:56] natural things right right we got to do
[1:07:58] that
[1:07:59] but they were married
[1:08:01] and given in marriage that giving and
[1:08:03] management they were just sleeping
[1:08:04] around
[1:08:06] i'm just being very frank
[1:08:08] let's just cut the chase they were
[1:08:10] married given in marriage you see
[1:08:11] everything
[1:08:13] boundaries no restrictions it was just
[1:08:15] all out
[1:08:17] now notice
[1:08:18] that was all going on that was a
[1:08:20] condition
[1:08:21] while
[1:08:22] god visited a prophet by the name of
[1:08:25] noah and his family was laboring under
[1:08:29] that absolute that he received in that
[1:08:32] hour
[1:08:34] in abraham's day
[1:08:37] you realize because these are these are
[1:08:38] promises within the word that were given
[1:08:41] to you and i in this hour
[1:08:43] that in in the coming of the son of man
[1:08:46] this is how
[1:08:47] that is going to be
[1:08:49] let me just say it to you in this manner
[1:08:51] look at this with abraham's day
[1:08:53] what was in abraham's day it was the
[1:08:55] prevailing sodomite conditions
[1:08:58] that served as the background
[1:09:01] is that right
[1:09:02] those those were the background that
[1:09:04] wasn't the focus
[1:09:07] that wasn't the focus
[1:09:08] but you see god had a word in that hour
[1:09:11] that like noah was focused abraham was
[1:09:13] focused all this this background around
[1:09:15] him was not the focus it was just
[1:09:18] happenings that was going on a setting
[1:09:20] in the background but in the midst of a
[1:09:22] sodomite condition when it had reached
[1:09:25] into that place
[1:09:26] elohim came down and took upon flesh and
[1:09:30] he went with a mission to bring that or
[1:09:34] cast the doubt out of sarah's life now
[1:09:37] remember the only way oh i hope you're
[1:09:39] hearing me now the only way to cast out
[1:09:41] doubt out of sarah it was not him
[1:09:43] wrestling and out of her it was the word
[1:09:46] coming and uncovering the doubt that
[1:09:49] laid in her heart and all she had to do
[1:09:51] at that moment remember she wanted to
[1:09:53] hide it that's the natural tendency
[1:09:55] within any life is to get away from the
[1:09:58] light but the light is not to harm you
[1:10:01] the light has come to deliver you the
[1:10:04] light has come to set you free it's a
[1:10:06] thief satan is a thief a robber he seeks
[1:10:10] to destroy he wants to remain hidden in
[1:10:13] your life but the light comes that you
[1:10:16] might walk in liberty
[1:10:19] well i don't want nobody to know about
[1:10:21] that jesus knows about it
[1:10:25] oh my you don't got to tell me or tell
[1:10:27] nobody else but you've got to be honest
[1:10:29] with jesus
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:33] so he came to dissolve doubt that was
[1:10:35] there in sarah's heart all of these
[1:10:37] background conditions that were going on
[1:10:40] that has the word would dissolve that
[1:10:42] doubt and we know it dissolved the doubt
[1:10:44] because the bible tells us
[1:10:46] that sarah herself
[1:10:48] judged him faithful
[1:10:51] and she received strength
[1:10:55] amen
[1:10:56] to conceive
[1:10:58] that strength that she received brought
[1:11:00] about a change in her body in order to
[1:11:03] meet the conditions that the promise
[1:11:05] called for
[1:11:08] is that right
[1:11:09] and then
[1:11:10] the same elohim that was there now
[1:11:13] remember he promised
[1:11:15] i will visit that room again are you
[1:11:17] hearing me now he promised in this end
[1:11:20] time i'll ride that trail again
[1:11:22] and he came but not the same flesh but
[1:11:25] he came in the flesh of his church and
[1:11:28] the lord visited sarah even as he said
[1:11:31] he would be
[1:11:33] a secret coming
[1:11:36] is that right but background conditions
[1:11:39] that were wrong within that hour
[1:11:42] but it was the dynamics that came to
[1:11:44] quicken the mechanics there
[1:11:46] in order for them to receive the
[1:11:48] promised son
[1:11:50] so to say it in this way
[1:11:52] as paul would write to timothy
[1:11:55] in the last days
[1:11:57] peerless times shall come
[1:12:01] now there's a lot more that
[1:12:02] i would just go ahead and you get a
[1:12:05] chance to read it or you're familiar
[1:12:06] with it a lot of those conditions
[1:12:10] you see
[1:12:11] it's right upon us even now
[1:12:15] there are things that you can i tell you
[1:12:17] when the reason when you read
[1:12:19] the message right now
[1:12:21] and you hear the message and it sounds
[1:12:23] as though that the prophet of god is
[1:12:26] standing here right now that ought to
[1:12:28] even be a greater clue that this was not
[1:12:30] the mind of a man
[1:12:32] this was the discernment of he which was
[1:12:35] which is and which is to come it's
[1:12:38] almighty god that was standing behind a
[1:12:41] veil of flesh it was the word that was
[1:12:43] wrapped up there that would be spoken in
[1:12:46] this hour for that word would come
[1:12:48] behind badger skins in the lives of his
[1:12:51] children
[1:12:54] hallelujah
[1:12:56] it seems like he's just right here
[1:12:58] when you're reading the message
[1:13:00] listening to the message
[1:13:02] is that right because there it is it's
[1:13:04] identifying seeds
[1:13:09] we're seeing hearts come forward amen
[1:13:12] this is harvest time
[1:13:14] this is why when you hear brother
[1:13:17] make the statements
[1:13:19] and he'll talk about how
[1:13:21] but satan
[1:13:22] had moved his seat
[1:13:25] there from paris and over into hollywood
[1:13:28] and to identify
[1:13:29] of how
[1:13:31] that out of hollywood when he would
[1:13:32] preach invasion of the united states he
[1:13:35] would tie it in to that of ahab and
[1:13:38] jezebel
[1:13:39] that would allow that to be brought at
[1:13:40] him and he would announce he said there
[1:13:42] are streams of demon powers that are
[1:13:46] streaming there out of hollywood i find
[1:13:48] that very peculiar streaming out of
[1:13:50] hollywood not only were they streaming
[1:13:53] in that hour through other forms of
[1:13:55] media and everything but right now there
[1:13:58] is streaming going on and reaching all
[1:14:01] over the place is that right this is why
[1:14:04] the bible could say in the book of
[1:14:06] genesis chapter 6 that the earth was
[1:14:08] filled with violence through them
[1:14:11] violence could not get loose in the
[1:14:13] earth unless it had channels to come
[1:14:15] through and there was channels that was
[1:14:18] reserved or available to actually be
[1:14:21] expressions of violence but oh let's
[1:14:23] look on our side now there was a man by
[1:14:26] the name of noah who was a reserved
[1:14:29] channel unto god that just as much as
[1:14:32] streams of demon power and violence
[1:14:35] would enter the earth god had a man upon
[1:14:37] the earth that would be a channel that
[1:14:39] righteousness could be dispensed in that
[1:14:42] hour that a people in that hour could be
[1:14:45] moved by the spirit of god into the
[1:14:47] place of safety prior to judgment
[1:14:51] i'll tell you it's a wonderful thing in
[1:14:52] this hour to be moved by the grace of
[1:14:55] god into the place of safety
[1:14:57] you see peerless times
[1:15:00] are right upon us
[1:15:02] brother brandon would say it over and
[1:15:03] over in different places in the message
[1:15:05] and i'll just refer to a few
[1:15:07] he talks about divorce and rape and
[1:15:09] crime
[1:15:10] he said stop it if you can but you can't
[1:15:12] stop it right he said it's god said it's
[1:15:15] going to be it's just right for judgment
[1:15:17] purpose in your heart that you'll not
[1:15:19] defile your defile yourself from the
[1:15:21] things of the world
[1:15:22] in the message 1963 he that's in you i'm
[1:15:25] just referring to these brother but
[1:15:26] that's there in the message but the
[1:15:28] bible said sin is worse than it ever was
[1:15:31] it will continue to get worse and there
[1:15:34] is no national repentance the nation is
[1:15:37] gone just you as individuals
[1:15:41] is that right sin will get worse and
[1:15:43] worse until one day the skies will catch
[1:15:46] on fire she'll fall to the earth and the
[1:15:48] earth will burn with fervent heat but
[1:15:50] the redeemed won't be here then they'll
[1:15:52] be gone
[1:15:54] it goes on to say in hebrews chapter
[1:15:56] seven great peerless times are at hand
[1:15:58] and more trouble laying in the road and
[1:16:01] we know that there'll never be better
[1:16:03] times we know that we're at the end
[1:16:05] times will continue to get worse and
[1:16:07] worse until jesus comes
[1:16:11] you see nobody can promise you better
[1:16:13] times
[1:16:15] and if somebody is you better run from
[1:16:17] them
[1:16:18] that's not according to the word of god
[1:16:20] that's a false spirit
[1:16:23] but the real spirit of god yes can
[1:16:26] announce that there the times is getting
[1:16:28] worse and worse but there's a place of
[1:16:30] safety that you can run into there's a
[1:16:33] place that in the midst of judgment you
[1:16:36] can receive mercy there is a place that
[1:16:39] while all of this distress is going on
[1:16:41] there is a place where you can have real
[1:16:44] joy and be stabilized against the
[1:16:47] pressures of this hour
[1:16:53] you know rapidly i read this quote to
[1:16:54] you on thursday night it'll rapidly get
[1:16:57] worse
[1:16:58] it's not going to gradually but rapidly
[1:17:00] get worse and it refers when russia goes
[1:17:03] down there to get that oil
[1:17:05] and that's all she needs
[1:17:07] and he says now get ready to meet christ
[1:17:10] he's sending great revivals and meetings
[1:17:13] and stirring the full gospel people
[1:17:15] signs and wonders appearing everywhere
[1:17:18] great wonders to draw his people
[1:17:20] together and one day he shall come the
[1:17:23] deliverer
[1:17:25] now in malachi chapter 4 verse 4 from
[1:17:28] your scriptures to us
[1:17:30] it should be
[1:17:32] i said it should be
[1:17:35] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[1:17:38] which i commanded unto him in horeb for
[1:17:41] all israel with the statutes and
[1:17:43] judgments behold i will send you
[1:17:46] elijah the prophet
[1:17:49] before the coming of the great and
[1:17:52] dreadful day of the lord notice before
[1:17:55] i will send him to you
[1:17:59] it'll go throughout all the world but
[1:18:01] i'm sending him purposely for you
[1:18:06] you see that ministry of a prophet is a
[1:18:09] ministry of
[1:18:10] life it's a ministry of mercy it's a
[1:18:14] ministry of grace but if it is rejected
[1:18:18] it becomes judgment
[1:18:20] but before oh
[1:18:22] thank god for his mercy and desire
[1:18:24] friends
[1:18:26] before
[1:18:28] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:18:29] of the lord somebody say before
[1:18:32] before
[1:18:35] satan would have loved to have you but
[1:18:37] before
[1:18:38] [Applause]
[1:18:41] how many were at their last moment or
[1:18:43] their wits end or wherever you're at but
[1:18:46] before the enemy can take you
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:51] god had a promise in his word
[1:18:57] hallelujah it's necessary that this word
[1:19:01] would come across your path and draw you
[1:19:04] into a place of surrender and transform
[1:19:06] your life
[1:19:09] can i say it like this
[1:19:15] even when you were in your mother's womb
[1:19:20] it was one of the safest safest
[1:19:22] pregnancies there was
[1:19:25] you know why
[1:19:27] because god was watching over his seed
[1:19:34] hallelujah the enemy could have tried to
[1:19:37] come with all sorts of upset and
[1:19:39] diseases and everything else but before
[1:19:41] god has a preparation
[1:19:45] now verse 6 here well we could preach on
[1:19:47] that but let's just try to go verse six
[1:19:50] and this is what he'll do
[1:19:54] he shall
[1:19:56] have a tv station and gather everybody
[1:19:58] to himself
[1:20:02] no amen
[1:20:05] this is what will be the evidence
[1:20:07] he will turn
[1:20:10] the heart of the fathers to the children
[1:20:12] that was the first coming
[1:20:15] that is identified in the scripture as
[1:20:17] the ministry of john the baptist
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:23] because see the ministry of elijah
[1:20:25] remember what it is it's calling them
[1:20:27] out they were all caught up under baal
[1:20:30] right truth
[1:20:32] right it's a calling out
[1:20:34] and the living god come on the scene to
[1:20:37] manifest himself john's ministry was a
[1:20:40] ministry of preparation for god himself
[1:20:45] to come on the scene
[1:20:49] is that right
[1:20:50] there's got to be a preparation that's
[1:20:52] made
[1:20:53] that's just why the coming of the holy
[1:20:54] ghost in your life there must be a
[1:20:56] preparation
[1:20:58] the holy ghost just doesn't come there
[1:21:01] is a preparation that is made and that
[1:21:04] preparation comes by the spirit of god
[1:21:07] dealing with your heart through the word
[1:21:09] and what is he doing he is preparing the
[1:21:12] pathway for himself
[1:21:15] now here's here's the promise that we're
[1:21:17] living in and the heart of the children
[1:21:19] to their fathers so the heart of the
[1:21:22] children back to the apostolic fathers
[1:21:25] lest i come and smite the earth with the
[1:21:27] curse of returning right back to the
[1:21:29] same original pentecostal blessing
[1:21:33] not pentecostal organization pentecostal
[1:21:36] blessing
[1:21:37] going back to an acts 2 and 4 experience
[1:21:41] is that right
[1:21:42] now notice in matthew 17 i i'm just
[1:21:45] reading these things to lay a little
[1:21:46] background here
[1:21:48] now here are the disciples they came to
[1:21:49] him and they said the scribes they're
[1:21:51] saying that elias elijah
[1:21:54] must first come
[1:21:56] well they were right right right elijah
[1:21:59] must first come you say wait a minute i
[1:22:00] thought you said it was john the baptist
[1:22:02] it was the spirit of christ with the
[1:22:05] same characteristic that it was in
[1:22:08] elijah is that right
[1:22:11] same characteristic that caught him back
[1:22:13] to the original sacrifice notice elias
[1:22:16] truly
[1:22:17] shall first come and restore all things
[1:22:21] he's speaking of the time we're living
[1:22:23] in
[1:22:24] shall first come now notice how he
[1:22:25] changes in verse 12 but i say unto you
[1:22:28] that elias elijah is come already
[1:22:33] he was announcing that ministry has
[1:22:36] already come
[1:22:39] and they knew it not but have done unto
[1:22:41] him whatsoever they listed
[1:22:43] likewise shall also the son of man
[1:22:46] suffer of them
[1:22:47] then the disciples understood that he
[1:22:50] spake unto them of john the baptist now
[1:22:51] look at this jesus never had to say this
[1:22:54] is john the baptist
[1:22:57] but he identifies it with the word
[1:23:01] and when he identified it with the word
[1:23:04] among believers that's where
[1:23:06] understanding comes to believers
[1:23:08] believers do not receive understanding
[1:23:11] from a textbook from a manual the
[1:23:13] believers receive understanding that
[1:23:16] comes by the ocean of the holy ghost
[1:23:18] taking a hold of the word and begin to
[1:23:20] break the seals off of it and be able to
[1:23:23] understand oh this is the hour we're
[1:23:26] living in
[1:23:27] are you hearing me
[1:23:28] this right here was a key moment for
[1:23:30] their lives
[1:23:32] because to recognize this was john the
[1:23:35] baptist what's it doing it's putting
[1:23:38] them there in line of the scripture to
[1:23:41] where we are at right now
[1:23:47] now brother adam will take it up in the
[1:23:49] message the rapture and identified in
[1:23:51] this way
[1:23:53] and he said there's too much
[1:23:54] supernatural vindication of god's
[1:23:56] written word of this hour for something
[1:23:58] not to be approaching us
[1:24:00] he said you hear these brothers standing
[1:24:02] up behind the platform and saying
[1:24:04] a message of the hour
[1:24:06] he said what they are actually getting
[1:24:08] at it's god's promise of this hour that
[1:24:11] he promised of what he would do
[1:24:13] and we see him scripturally vindicating
[1:24:15] it foretold it's perfectly each time
[1:24:19] because it's god
[1:24:21] saying it
[1:24:22] well the rhyme goes on i i've just
[1:24:24] always you know
[1:24:25] been drawn to this here in marvel how
[1:24:27] you know you understand that this
[1:24:29] message
[1:24:30] supernaturally under the orchestration
[1:24:33] of the holy spirit and let me tell you
[1:24:36] this message has not been manhandled
[1:24:39] and it will never produce itself through
[1:24:40] the handling of man
[1:24:42] but when when it is the spirit of christ
[1:24:45] remember
[1:24:46] it's the spirit of christ that must pack
[1:24:48] the message of the hour
[1:24:51] is that right
[1:24:52] it must be the spirit of christ because
[1:24:55] it takes the spirit of christ the
[1:24:57] dynamics of god to produce the mechanics
[1:25:00] and give life to him and cause it to
[1:25:02] move down the road you know we're not
[1:25:04] interested in being associated around
[1:25:06] something we're here this morning
[1:25:08] because of life there's a yearning in
[1:25:10] our heart and if you don't have that
[1:25:12] this morning let me announce why you're
[1:25:14] here you're here because there's a
[1:25:15] drawing power that's trying to draw you
[1:25:18] to the healing stone that's announcing
[1:25:21] to you right now that the fountain is
[1:25:23] open in the house of david the promised
[1:25:26] word of god in this hour it'll clean
[1:25:29] your life up it won't just bring you to
[1:25:31] an altar over and over it'll clean your
[1:25:34] life up it'll take habits out of your
[1:25:36] life it'll place a reality on the inside
[1:25:39] by the new birth that you're a new
[1:25:41] creature
[1:25:45] think of this and the message of rapture
[1:25:47] goes on i love how it says it here he
[1:25:49] says you know and we go back in the
[1:25:51] scriptures he says and it may seem
[1:25:53] foreign to us but we turn right back in
[1:25:56] the scriptures without even knowing
[1:25:58] where to look
[1:25:59] and the holy spirit brings out and just
[1:26:02] puts the whole word together makes the
[1:26:04] picture there to show us the hour we're
[1:26:06] living in we're changing
[1:26:09] dispensations
[1:26:11] you see he was announcing within that
[1:26:13] message of the rapture you know it
[1:26:16] continued to hold in
[1:26:17] all the way through the message it was
[1:26:19] honing in on one goal
[1:26:22] and that was a relationship between god
[1:26:25] and his people
[1:26:26] where a bride would be united with
[1:26:28] christ
[1:26:30] where that god himself would finish the
[1:26:33] mystery the his temple the house that he
[1:26:36] was building by revelation that he would
[1:26:39] he himself that built that house by the
[1:26:41] revelation of himself personally would
[1:26:44] come and cap it all off with himself
[1:26:48] are you hearing me now
[1:26:50] now you see this is why he can announce
[1:26:53] and say we're not building a wall we're
[1:26:55] building a house
[1:26:58] amen that's why the coming of the lord
[1:27:00] the announcement the silence is because
[1:27:02] he descended to his tabernacle
[1:27:06] come on and there's a woman up on earth
[1:27:08] who's learning in silence
[1:27:13] hallelujah
[1:27:15] oh glory be to god
[1:27:17] notice he says in end time evangelism
[1:27:20] the end time messenger and message
[1:27:22] should meet with end time conditions
[1:27:25] oh he said the message could not have
[1:27:27] been preached 40 years ago no the end
[1:27:30] time message and messenger has got to
[1:27:32] meet back there in them days they
[1:27:34] probably wouldn't have worked but it's
[1:27:36] got to cope with end time conditions be
[1:27:39] converted believe the gospel signs
[1:27:41] that's the message of today
[1:27:44] wash your souls in the blood of the lamb
[1:27:46] and believe in the gospel that the end
[1:27:48] times signs are here the seed of the
[1:27:51] gospel has been taking place
[1:27:54] oh my i love you just preach a message
[1:27:56] called that's the message
[1:27:58] you see that's in the message is the
[1:28:00] restoration
[1:28:02] back to the original pentecostal
[1:28:04] blessing
[1:28:06] oh hallelujah back to where the same one
[1:28:10] who was who was crucified who went down
[1:28:14] into the grave and descended into the
[1:28:16] lowest parts of hell and rose upon that
[1:28:18] easter morning and leading captivity
[1:28:21] captive had a meeting with his disciples
[1:28:23] and then he ascended on up on high and
[1:28:25] he was there holding the password to get
[1:28:28] in open ye up the everlasting gates and
[1:28:31] they said who is this king of glory oh
[1:28:35] my who is this it's the lord mighty in
[1:28:38] battle
[1:28:39] oh my he won the second person and
[1:28:42] overcome oh my he won the secretary that
[1:28:45] came down it was the lord himself that
[1:28:49] descended down
[1:28:53] hallelujah
[1:28:55] and the gates open you the gates of
[1:28:58] righteousness
[1:29:00] glory be to god and he sent back the
[1:29:02] holy spirit
[1:29:04] back down upon earth and that holy
[1:29:07] spirit being manifested in the lives of
[1:29:10] the believer it reflected the mighty
[1:29:13] conqueror as he was seated there on the
[1:29:15] mercy seat it reflected it back in their
[1:29:18] life giving them dominion over sin flesh
[1:29:21] the devil and the world amen
[1:29:25] glory to god i feel like speaking in
[1:29:27] tongues
[1:29:29] it's a preparation hour that we're in
[1:29:32] matthew 16 1
[1:29:34] the pharisees also with the sadducees
[1:29:37] came and tempting desired him that he
[1:29:40] would show them a sign from heaven
[1:29:43] he answered and said unto them when it
[1:29:45] is evening you say it'll be fair weather
[1:29:48] for the sky is red
[1:29:50] and in the morning it'll be foul weather
[1:29:52] today for the sky is red and lowering oh
[1:29:54] you hypocrites you can discern the face
[1:29:57] of the sky but you cannot discern the
[1:29:59] signs of the times
[1:30:02] a wicked and adulterous generation
[1:30:04] seeketh after a sign
[1:30:07] and there shall no sign be given unto it
[1:30:09] but the sign of the prophet jonas
[1:30:11] and he left them and departed
[1:30:13] that's a resurrection sign
[1:30:17] now brother brown will take this and i'm
[1:30:19] going to say this
[1:30:20] if you haven't listened to
[1:30:23] the message uniting time and sign i
[1:30:26] i've been for
[1:30:27] weeks just listening to it over and over
[1:30:32] not with the intent of ministering this
[1:30:33] but
[1:30:34] if you haven't listened to it i'll give
[1:30:36] you the date here it's a
[1:30:37] 1963 august the 18th
[1:30:40] and brother branham would take in that
[1:30:42] message and he identifies
[1:30:45] right where we're at which is throughout
[1:30:47] the message
[1:30:48] and he would speak of how that god
[1:30:51] in this hour he was rebuking that
[1:30:54] scriptures we read he was rebuking the
[1:30:56] clergy
[1:30:57] for them not knowing
[1:30:59] what was taken place
[1:31:02] and he said you know god writes it so
[1:31:03] plainly
[1:31:05] so nobody could escape it right
[1:31:08] you see god gives
[1:31:10] brother brown said it's always been
[1:31:11] god's way so they were asking him for
[1:31:12] signs he said
[1:31:14] god he he gave him natural signs
[1:31:17] so that everybody would know what time
[1:31:18] it is he would have prophets that the
[1:31:20] prophets would come and as it would say
[1:31:22] in the scripture he had understanding by
[1:31:24] visions from the lord and the word of
[1:31:26] the lord came to the prophets of old so
[1:31:28] the prophets give a sign so a prophet
[1:31:31] himself is a sign
[1:31:33] a prophet is a sign of impending
[1:31:36] judgment
[1:31:39] amen you see according to what god has
[1:31:42] promised within this hour
[1:31:45] so we find that even within this
[1:31:48] you know let me just pause here because
[1:31:50] i feel that coming to me
[1:31:52] it's just like when you look at hebrews
[1:31:53] chapter one and i know there's a lot of
[1:31:56] individuals that like to go in this and
[1:31:57] i'm not going to say that it'd be people
[1:31:59] that are around our ranks but sometimes
[1:32:01] there's things that can come around and
[1:32:03] say well you know the law and the
[1:32:04] prophets were until john
[1:32:06] but the understanding of that scripture
[1:32:08] is all that the law and the prophets
[1:32:10] spoke of concerning the messiah
[1:32:14] come on now because there was still more
[1:32:17] to be fulfilled
[1:32:19] and when the scripture said in the book
[1:32:21] of hebrews chapter one that in sundried
[1:32:24] times he spake to the fathers
[1:32:27] in the prophets
[1:32:29] but in this last days has spoken to us
[1:32:31] through his son
[1:32:32] his son is the word
[1:32:35] is that right
[1:32:37] and then remember that when the church
[1:32:39] ages started the word was lost
[1:32:43] it had been little by little by little
[1:32:46] right it had been speaking there through
[1:32:49] the sun but in this hour we're not under
[1:32:52] a partial light amen
[1:32:54] but the bible we're under the sun is
[1:32:57] shining in its strength as a matter of
[1:32:59] fact the bible says in the book of
[1:33:01] isaiah that the strength of the sun
[1:33:03] would be seven times strong we are
[1:33:06] living in the hour where the sun is
[1:33:08] shining in his trip why would it need to
[1:33:10] be in his strength because it takes a
[1:33:13] harvest time life to bring harvest time
[1:33:16] conditions and harvest time ripening
[1:33:19] there shall be light in the evening time
[1:33:23] amen he's speaking through his son
[1:33:26] through his word to you and i personally
[1:33:29] yeah
[1:33:30] oh my but you see the religious in that
[1:33:33] day
[1:33:34] the pharisees sadducees and them
[1:33:37] they thought they were living pretty
[1:33:38] peaceful
[1:33:40] so they weren't looking for no messiah
[1:33:42] they weren't watching for the sign
[1:33:45] brother brown would pick it up and say
[1:33:46] these signs
[1:33:48] are given for believers
[1:33:51] he would say it don't matter how many
[1:33:52] pillar fires could appear on the
[1:33:54] platform it'll never have an effect
[1:33:57] up only upon believers
[1:34:01] you see the word
[1:34:02] is what takes an effect that's right and
[1:34:05] i'm so glad i'm glad it ain't up to man
[1:34:07] who decides
[1:34:10] who i'm gonna preach now
[1:34:12] man we'd like to cut it off come on
[1:34:14] friends we've had isms come around our
[1:34:16] message and want to cut things off and
[1:34:18] i've got the revelation you got to come
[1:34:20] to me and you got to seek it out but let
[1:34:22] me tell you something there is not a
[1:34:24] child of god that will stay in a
[1:34:27] condition like that where they're
[1:34:28] isolated off why we are born by one
[1:34:31] spirit into the body of jesus christ
[1:34:34] it's a longing in our heart to be united
[1:34:37] with the rest of the body there is no
[1:34:39] big eyes and little use the only thing
[1:34:42] is jesus christ and that's the only
[1:34:44] thing we care about
[1:34:47] hallelujah
[1:34:48] how are we going to get down all these
[1:34:50] fences we ain't tearing the fences down
[1:34:52] just let the water the resting water of
[1:34:56] the holy spirit come forth it'll cause
[1:34:59] the water level to rise it'll bring out
[1:35:02] everything where there were barriers the
[1:35:04] water level will rise and there's no
[1:35:06] more barriers
[1:35:09] you know what the problem is some of you
[1:35:11] need to let the water rise in your own
[1:35:12] life
[1:35:15] you got too many barriers in your life
[1:35:18] you're busy building fences about this
[1:35:20] and fences about this look it's a
[1:35:22] natural thing within our life to build
[1:35:24] fences to say i don't want to be hurt
[1:35:26] nobody wants to be hurt and neither am i
[1:35:28] telling you to put yourself into a place
[1:35:30] to be hurt but it's time to invite the
[1:35:33] holy spirit on the inside it's time to
[1:35:36] open up and say god i need a refilling
[1:35:39] or if you haven't been filled i need a
[1:35:42] feeling lord i need to be delivered of
[1:35:45] the fences in my life the barriers that
[1:35:47] have wanted to hold me back oh god let
[1:35:51] the resting mighty wind
[1:35:53] come down lord
[1:35:58] hallelujah
[1:35:59] he pointed out
[1:36:01] jesus pointed out national signs
[1:36:04] heavenly signs
[1:36:06] earthly signs so there's natural signs
[1:36:09] national signs
[1:36:11] earthly signs
[1:36:13] and there's heavenly signs
[1:36:16] now remember
[1:36:18] in the scriptures where jesus would take
[1:36:22] in matthew 24
[1:36:24] and in matthew 24 he would unfold
[1:36:26] the seals in there
[1:36:29] he would unfold
[1:36:31] even the whole
[1:36:33] what brother brown called the amateur
[1:36:34] tribulation of the eichmann time it's
[1:36:37] everything was unfolded
[1:36:39] clear down into the coming of the lord
[1:36:41] and
[1:36:41] the turning the dealing with the jews
[1:36:43] and
[1:36:44] wrapping all that up
[1:36:46] but here's something that we find in the
[1:36:48] scriptures
[1:36:49] matthew 24 32 now learn a parable of the
[1:36:52] fig tree
[1:36:53] when his branch is yet tender
[1:36:55] and putteth forth leaves you know
[1:36:58] that summer is nigh
[1:37:00] so likewise ye when you shall see
[1:37:03] all these things
[1:37:04] know that it is near even at the doors
[1:37:08] now just in case you didn't know but i
[1:37:12] i'm just going to take it as though you
[1:37:13] don't know but i believe you do
[1:37:16] but abandonment identified that the same
[1:37:18] night
[1:37:19] that the angel of the lord
[1:37:21] came to him
[1:37:22] and commissioned him there
[1:37:25] in may of 1946
[1:37:28] is the same
[1:37:29] hour where israel become a nation
[1:37:32] now i know when you go look it up on the
[1:37:33] internet you don't want to point out
[1:37:35] 1947 or 1948 but if you go to dig a
[1:37:38] little deeper there it's in 1945 when
[1:37:40] the president of the united united
[1:37:42] states here that actually allowed
[1:37:43] members to go in there
[1:37:46] are you hearing me now
[1:37:50] you see
[1:37:51] god has spoke to this that this would be
[1:37:54] a parable that in this time you know if
[1:37:57] you want to know what time it is as far
[1:37:59] as is it getting close to quitting time
[1:38:01] you look at your watch
[1:38:02] if you want to know is it time to you
[1:38:04] know plant potatoes you look at your
[1:38:06] calendar
[1:38:07] right
[1:38:08] but israel is god's timepiece
[1:38:13] you can look at it and you see what's
[1:38:15] taking place and israel
[1:38:17] has been
[1:38:18] back there in her homeland now i want to
[1:38:20] i want to switch here just a little bit
[1:38:22] and i wanted to pick up another place
[1:38:24] here and let's look in the book of
[1:38:25] daniel chapter 2.
[1:38:28] in order to just deal with this here
[1:38:29] just just a few moments on this image
[1:38:33] in verse
[1:38:34] in verse 36
[1:38:37] or let me start in daniel 2 34.
[1:38:40] thou saw us till that a stone was cut
[1:38:42] out without hands now daniel is is
[1:38:45] seeing he's showing now in these verses
[1:38:47] exactly what nebuchadnezzar saw
[1:38:50] a stone was cut out without hands which
[1:38:52] smote the image upon his feet that were
[1:38:55] of iron and clay and break them to
[1:38:57] pieces then was the iron the clay the
[1:38:59] brass the silver the gold broke into
[1:39:01] pieces together and became like the
[1:39:03] chaff of the summer threshing floors and
[1:39:06] the wind carried them away that no place
[1:39:08] was found for them and the stone that
[1:39:10] smote the image became a great mountain
[1:39:13] and filled the whole earth now now in
[1:39:16] daniel 30 daniel 2 36 how daniel begins
[1:39:19] to unfold the interpretation to the king
[1:39:22] now you know when we look at this here i
[1:39:25] want you to understand this for a minute
[1:39:27] daniel remember we set a prophet
[1:39:29] to receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:39:31] prophet
[1:39:32] there comes life
[1:39:34] death was upon this kingdom
[1:39:37] nebuchadnezzar he said when them those
[1:39:40] astrologers soothsayers whatever they
[1:39:42] were they came and why don't you just
[1:39:43] tell us a dream
[1:39:45] nebuchadnezzar said i'm going to kill
[1:39:46] every one of you
[1:39:48] because i know all you'd want to do is
[1:39:49] me tell it to you and then you want to
[1:39:50] twist it around and try to bring it out
[1:39:52] like this
[1:39:56] but you see
[1:39:57] in that moment daniel speaks out
[1:40:01] and he says you tell the king
[1:40:05] don't be hasty
[1:40:11] there was somebody in the kingdom who
[1:40:14] knew there is a god
[1:40:18] who interprets
[1:40:21] what he sends he interprets it
[1:40:26] thou king are the king of kings for the
[1:40:29] god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom
[1:40:32] power and strength and glory and
[1:40:34] wheresoever the children of men dwell
[1:40:36] the beast of the field and the fowls of
[1:40:38] the heaven hath he given into thy hand
[1:40:40] and hath made thee ruler over them all
[1:40:43] thou art this head of gold
[1:40:45] and after these shall arise another
[1:40:48] kingdom and farrier to thee another
[1:40:50] kingdom of brass which shall bear rule
[1:40:52] over the earth
[1:40:54] and the fourth kingdom
[1:40:56] shall be as strong as iron
[1:40:58] for as much as iron breaketh in pieces
[1:41:01] and subdueth all things and as iron that
[1:41:03] breaketh all these shall it break in
[1:41:05] pieces and bruise
[1:41:06] and whereas thou sawest the feet and
[1:41:08] toes part of potter's clay
[1:41:11] and part of iron the kingdom shall be
[1:41:13] divided but there shall be in it of the
[1:41:16] strength of the iron for as much as thou
[1:41:18] sawest the iron mixed
[1:41:21] with my reclaim
[1:41:23] now
[1:41:24] that fourth kingdom
[1:41:26] is that roman kingdom
[1:41:30] now remember this vision right here i
[1:41:32] don't have time this morning but this
[1:41:33] vision it parallels daniel 7
[1:41:37] revelations 12 and revelations 13.
[1:41:40] remember papal remember that of pagan
[1:41:43] rome
[1:41:44] that beast it received a wound
[1:41:48] but that wound was healed
[1:41:52] right
[1:41:53] where pagan rome there went powerless
[1:41:56] but now
[1:41:57] that through papal rome there was a
[1:42:00] revival right
[1:42:02] is that right
[1:42:04] and so when the scripture here
[1:42:06] identifies i want you to catch this here
[1:42:09] satan's number has already been called
[1:42:12] out before he ever advanced
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:17] oh my
[1:42:19] notice how that the iron itself it shall
[1:42:23] it shall go forth then into the feet and
[1:42:26] the toes brother branham would say it in
[1:42:28] this manner he said you know when you
[1:42:30] think of he says revelations 13 3 i'm
[1:42:32] just going to refer to this was wounded
[1:42:34] to death the pagan roman empire but it
[1:42:36] came back to life as the holy roman
[1:42:38] empire rome as a material nation had
[1:42:41] suffered much depletion and soon would
[1:42:44] suffer it completely but it mattered not
[1:42:46] now for her religious empire would keep
[1:42:49] her on top of the world governing from
[1:42:51] the inside where she would not appear to
[1:42:54] do so from the outside
[1:42:57] are you with me
[1:43:03] she doesn't have an army
[1:43:08] but see she sweeps in and just able to
[1:43:10] take the nation
[1:43:13] see everything putting forth see all
[1:43:16] these things were adding up everything
[1:43:18] from even the seed in hollywood all
[1:43:20] these things are moving forth and if
[1:43:21] there is a weakening and a weakening and
[1:43:23] a weakening and then here when it moves
[1:43:26] into that place think about where we're
[1:43:27] at right now
[1:43:29] i know they just there's one gentleman
[1:43:31] retiring from the supreme court
[1:43:33] but do you realize the makeup of the
[1:43:34] supreme court right now
[1:43:37] seven
[1:43:38] catholics
[1:43:41] two jews
[1:43:43] and one of the jews is retiring
[1:43:46] i've studied to find out what is the
[1:43:48] lady that they're putting in there
[1:43:51] now she has professions of faith as a
[1:43:52] matter of fact when you go to look her
[1:43:54] up she's on the catholic headlines
[1:43:59] just read it last night on the big
[1:44:00] catholic report
[1:44:04] you see
[1:44:05] came in and took it without a shot
[1:44:11] i need more time to preach this
[1:44:13] to preach some of these behind the
[1:44:14] scenes parts but i just got to move on
[1:44:16] today because i'm not gonna i'm not
[1:44:18] gonna dwell within that but you see how
[1:44:20] it it's just it's setting it up and you
[1:44:22] even get the conservative parts the envy
[1:44:25] evangelicals and everybody yes yes yes
[1:44:28] yes it's a conservative appointee yes
[1:44:31] yes yes you see what it is
[1:44:33] it's rallying against something that's
[1:44:36] setting them up
[1:44:38] i'm not going to preach this this
[1:44:39] morning but
[1:44:42] notice daniel chapter 2 verse 42. let's
[1:44:44] go on and as the toes of the feet were
[1:44:48] part of iron and part of clay so the
[1:44:51] kingdom shall be partly strong and
[1:44:53] partly broken you see
[1:44:56] anything that's divided will fall
[1:44:59] are you hearing me now that's why you
[1:45:01] can't be a divided christian
[1:45:03] you can't have a divided heart you can't
[1:45:06] love the things of the world and say
[1:45:08] well i love god you've got to make up
[1:45:10] your mind and be totally sold out
[1:45:14] because to be divided in this hour is to
[1:45:17] be overthrown that's what david could
[1:45:20] say in psalms 86 unite my heart to fear
[1:45:24] thy name oh god
[1:45:29] it's an hour where things are coming to
[1:45:31] try to divide and divide and divide
[1:45:36] right satan knows if he can come and
[1:45:38] divide he can conquer
[1:45:41] is that right
[1:45:43] you see you can't live a victorious life
[1:45:45] as long as you're divided a
[1:45:47] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:45:51] ways
[1:45:53] brother samuel why do i keep on having
[1:45:55] this trouble cause you haven't surrender
[1:45:58] your life to god
[1:46:00] you need to invite god come and kill
[1:46:03] this whole worldly nature in me
[1:46:06] amen
[1:46:07] brother samuel i'm a pretty good guy i'm
[1:46:10] a pretty good girl but remember good
[1:46:12] guys and good girls go to hell too
[1:46:15] amen
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:18] come on friends the rich young ruler
[1:46:21] that guy was a good guy
[1:46:22] but he lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:46:25] because he rejected eternal life
[1:46:31] you can't serve god with the divided
[1:46:34] heart
[1:46:35] the message of the hour came to turn our
[1:46:38] hearts that's what the real word birth
[1:46:40] is that's what the real baptism of the
[1:46:43] holy ghost is it's turning your heart
[1:46:46] back to the apostolic fathers to where
[1:46:49] you're united with this word fully in
[1:46:52] your life
[1:46:54] i'm going to preach in a house it's not
[1:46:56] enough just to go along with it it's not
[1:46:58] enough just to come here to church
[1:47:00] you've got to meet jesus christ
[1:47:04] you've got to meet him yourself
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:08] that's what this message calls us back
[1:47:10] to
[1:47:13] as the toes of the feet were part of
[1:47:15] iron
[1:47:16] and part of clay
[1:47:18] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[1:47:20] and partly broken and where has thou saw
[1:47:22] its iron
[1:47:24] mixed with my reclaim
[1:47:26] they shall mingle themselves with the
[1:47:27] seed of men
[1:47:28] but they shall not cleave one to another
[1:47:31] even as iron is not mixed with clay
[1:47:42] brother and will pick this up as a
[1:47:43] prophet of god
[1:47:44] and he'll deal with verse 43
[1:47:47] and speaking about intermarrying
[1:47:52] catholics marrying protestants
[1:47:58] what does it do weakening
[1:48:00] let me tell you something
[1:48:02] brother brandon said that you take a
[1:48:04] good woman and a bad man he'll either
[1:48:06] make him a bad woman or make her a bad
[1:48:09] woman or she'll make him a good man
[1:48:13] is that right
[1:48:14] but let me just let me let me let me
[1:48:16] move on to that quarter is that all
[1:48:17] right
[1:48:18] if you really met jesus christ
[1:48:21] that's who you need to get married to
[1:48:23] first
[1:48:25] you get married to him first he'll tell
[1:48:28] you who to marry
[1:48:30] you can trust his judgment
[1:48:33] because you're not looking out here
[1:48:34] seeing if you can find christ but if
[1:48:36] you're trying to find christ you'll find
[1:48:38] your mate
[1:48:40] come on friends
[1:48:42] see everything satan works oh my satan
[1:48:46] works to try to break break things he
[1:48:49] tries to break the power and influence
[1:48:52] of this word upon your life that's why i
[1:48:54] want you to hold on to them old friends
[1:48:56] i ain't got nothing against them people
[1:48:58] i'm not saying you should either but
[1:49:00] look what they're doing to your life if
[1:49:02] you're spending more time around worldly
[1:49:04] people and worldly friends you need to
[1:49:07] check your appetite on the inside
[1:49:11] you're mixed iron and clay you're trying
[1:49:14] to mix the holy ghost with a cesspool
[1:49:17] how can two walk together unless they be
[1:49:19] agreed
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:23] hallelujah
[1:49:25] preach brother samuel thank you i think
[1:49:26] i will
[1:49:30] this is not a time to be divided all
[1:49:32] right
[1:49:35] that's the truth
[1:49:37] oh my
[1:49:38] you see in the thy tyrant age
[1:49:41] brother brown would pick this up all
[1:49:42] throughout the message but i'm going to
[1:49:44] read it from here
[1:49:45] he says i want you to recall the vision
[1:49:47] of daniel i think i have this one the
[1:49:49] last part of the image
[1:49:50] the last world power was in the feet
[1:49:54] that was iron and clay see the iron is
[1:49:56] the roman empire
[1:49:57] but now it's no longer solid iron
[1:50:00] play is mixed in it
[1:50:02] yet it's there and running world affairs
[1:50:05] in both the democratic nations
[1:50:07] and more despotic ones the roman church
[1:50:11] is in every nation
[1:50:13] it is mixed up
[1:50:14] in it all
[1:50:17] mixed up
[1:50:18] in it all
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:22] let me give you a little something on
[1:50:24] the iron and clay
[1:50:26] remember when khrushchev beat his shoe
[1:50:29] on the desk at the u.n october 1960 well
[1:50:32] there were five eastern nations there
[1:50:35] and five western
[1:50:37] cruise ships spoke for the east and
[1:50:39] president eisenhower for the west
[1:50:42] in russian khrushchev is clay
[1:50:45] and eisenhower means iron you can look
[1:50:48] it up
[1:50:49] the two main leaders of the world the
[1:50:52] two
[1:50:53] big toes of the feet of iron and clay
[1:50:56] were side by side we are in the end of
[1:51:00] it all
[1:51:03] tell me it was just by chance that the
[1:51:05] shoe
[1:51:07] was taken off i don't think so
[1:51:10] you see others look at look at friends
[1:51:13] even in this hour or you can see all
[1:51:15] sorts of youtube videos and you see
[1:51:17] different ones i i've seen a heading on
[1:51:20] a youtube video all the iron and clay is
[1:51:22] mixing together and then when i looked
[1:51:23] at it and said well they might be able
[1:51:25] to they might be able to see that part
[1:51:26] of it because you can read commentaries
[1:51:29] and commentaries will talk about that
[1:51:30] but you know what the difference is is
[1:51:32] not only to see that but to identify the
[1:51:35] scriptural sign in this hour it's one
[1:51:37] time one thing to see a natural sign
[1:51:39] it's one thing to see a national sign
[1:51:42] it's one thing to see an earthly sign
[1:51:44] but you must see the heavenly side
[1:51:46] because it's a heavenly sign that
[1:51:49] unlocks every other sign
[1:51:52] is that right and the heavenly sign is
[1:51:54] his word may manifest
[1:51:56] so notice the shoe taken off and beaten
[1:51:59] on the desk the two big toes eisenhower
[1:52:02] and khrushchev
[1:52:05] five eastern five western
[1:52:08] can i have just a little bit more time
[1:52:10] amen
[1:52:13] now the bible tells us and i'm just
[1:52:15] going to make some references here
[1:52:17] the bible tells us in romans 13
[1:52:20] daniel also
[1:52:22] records this as well that god sets kings
[1:52:24] up and takes kings down
[1:52:26] right nebuchadnezzar thought
[1:52:28] nebuchadnezzar thought he was the big
[1:52:30] cheese
[1:52:31] you know i'm the guy everybody
[1:52:33] daniel said no god takes down
[1:52:36] and god sets up
[1:52:38] whatever means it has to come by
[1:52:41] god will take down and god will set up
[1:52:45] is that right
[1:52:47] now notice
[1:52:48] there is in romans 13 1 there is no
[1:52:50] power
[1:52:51] but of god
[1:52:53] the powers that that be are ordained of
[1:52:56] god
[1:52:58] amen it doesn't listen to me you're
[1:53:00] wasting your time
[1:53:02] aaron
[1:53:03] everything
[1:53:04] about the president about everything
[1:53:06] else
[1:53:09] so true you wait because let me tell you
[1:53:11] something it couldn't be there unless
[1:53:13] god ordained it
[1:53:17] are you hearing me
[1:53:19] it couldn't be there unless god ordained
[1:53:21] it
[1:53:23] come on friends it wasn't people or
[1:53:26] ballots that put him there
[1:53:28] god ordained it
[1:53:34] now i mentioned to you the statement
[1:53:36] here
[1:53:37] on
[1:53:39] thursday night
[1:53:42] regarding
[1:53:43] the seven visions i want you to think of
[1:53:45] when
[1:53:46] brother branham speaks of this
[1:53:49] that
[1:53:50] as he is announcing
[1:53:52] that were at the end
[1:53:55] and remember what he said regarding
[1:53:57] 1977.
[1:54:01] you know even brother george smith
[1:54:03] standing here but i told you the day i
[1:54:05] you know we've heard that many of the
[1:54:06] older even older ones here that's heard
[1:54:07] this brother dave you've heard it
[1:54:09] already
[1:54:11] but when they asked for the branham why
[1:54:12] was it why was it just 1977 you were
[1:54:15] looking at
[1:54:16] you said because it was
[1:54:18] so dark i couldn't see nothing beyond
[1:54:22] 77. yes
[1:54:25] now i'm going to tell you when you go
[1:54:26] back and study brother lonnie did a
[1:54:28] tremendous study on this and breaking it
[1:54:30] down but when you go down and you just
[1:54:31] ted it yourself you look at when america
[1:54:33] rejected the gospel in 1956
[1:54:38] billy graham or roberts brother
[1:54:40] ministries sweeping across this country
[1:54:42] it was announced and declared this is a
[1:54:44] pivotal year
[1:54:47] and you look after the rejection of the
[1:54:49] gospel you say well they were carrying
[1:54:51] around the bible the gospel is not the
[1:54:54] written word the gospel is the holy
[1:54:57] ghost the manifested word of the hour
[1:55:01] and they rejected it
[1:55:07] you're with me
[1:55:09] just reading here last night
[1:55:11] think about it the earthquake that took
[1:55:13] place in alaska there
[1:55:16] some days there with that visitation on
[1:55:19] mount sunset
[1:55:21] and that earthquake there in alaska it
[1:55:24] shook buildings clear over in
[1:55:25] switzerland
[1:55:27] brother branham pulls us together and
[1:55:28] identifies he said that happened on a
[1:55:30] good friday and he said wasn't there an
[1:55:33] earthquake on another good friday when
[1:55:35] they rejected our lord jesus christ he
[1:55:38] said see that earthquake came showing
[1:55:41] jesus is put out
[1:55:45] that's why 1963 the ministry that comes
[1:55:49] forth to ident and indict this
[1:55:52] generation to indict the churches
[1:55:54] there's an indictment that's been made
[1:56:00] hallelujah and these visions brother
[1:56:02] bram said seven continuous visions that
[1:56:05] came there in june of 1933
[1:56:10] i'm not much of a math guy
[1:56:12] but i know that that is close to being
[1:56:14] 90 years
[1:56:16] 89 years ago
[1:56:18] june
[1:56:20] now
[1:56:22] let me say this
[1:56:23] brother brown goes through these seven
[1:56:26] visions
[1:56:27] and he speaks of them you mind if i read
[1:56:29] them
[1:56:30] not all word for word but just refer to
[1:56:31] it for a few of them the first vision
[1:56:34] mussolini's invasion into ethiopia
[1:56:36] incredible brother branstad when he told
[1:56:38] that in his church some people got mad
[1:56:42] he said that cost me a lot but you see
[1:56:43] all he's doing is telling the vision
[1:56:46] the next one was the rising of adolf
[1:56:48] hitler
[1:56:50] a dictator over germany the next one
[1:56:51] would be in the realm of politics and i
[1:56:53] want you to watch this third vision in
[1:56:54] the realm of politics and he would show
[1:56:56] me the three great isms fascism nazism
[1:56:59] communism and the first two
[1:57:02] fascism and nazism would be swallowed up
[1:57:04] in the third and the voice admonished
[1:57:07] watch russia watch russia keep your eye
[1:57:10] on the king of the north
[1:57:12] and that's a yeah russia this is 1933.
[1:57:16] it was not called russia
[1:57:19] it was called the ussr
[1:57:21] soviet union
[1:57:23] but the holy spirit is time was calling
[1:57:26] it out watch russia
[1:57:28] now let me just d can i i've already
[1:57:30] started this far
[1:57:38] let's see if they're the same you
[1:57:39] tricked us no but notice watch russia
[1:57:41] the voice the voice of admonish watch
[1:57:43] russia watch russia
[1:57:45] the fourth the fourth vision showed
[1:57:47] great advances in science that would
[1:57:50] come after the second world war you know
[1:57:51] the remote control car right
[1:57:54] you're going to go back and look it up
[1:57:56] ford had one of the first ones
[1:57:58] 1925 remote controlled
[1:58:01] newspapers right out on it are you with
[1:58:03] me things have been going on all the
[1:58:05] time
[1:58:07] now
[1:58:08] the the fifth one the fifth version the
[1:58:10] moral problem of our age centering
[1:58:12] mostly around women
[1:58:14] cutting her hair wearing men's clothing
[1:58:16] but you see that that women in the
[1:58:18] natural is only reflecting the church
[1:58:21] because why a cut hair listen a cut hair
[1:58:25] symbolizes rebellion
[1:58:27] when israel in the book of jeremiah
[1:58:29] walked away from god god said go ahead
[1:58:31] and cut your hair off why because
[1:58:34] inwardly they were rebelling against the
[1:58:36] word and the word is her veil and
[1:58:39] remember when she removes the word she's
[1:58:41] removed the authority and the veil of
[1:58:43] the word
[1:58:49] the fifth vision
[1:58:50] now over and over through the message
[1:58:52] and i'm just gonna take what the prophet
[1:58:54] said i see it
[1:58:56] over and over and over again he says
[1:58:58] five of the seven visions
[1:59:00] are fulfilled
[1:59:02] now you and i can say in this hour the
[1:59:05] sixth vision where there was a rose up
[1:59:07] in america most beautiful cruel woman
[1:59:12] that's twofold
[1:59:14] are you hearing me
[1:59:15] you look it up in sixfold daniel even
[1:59:17] the daniel vision how brother brown
[1:59:19] would say it how the spirit of the lord
[1:59:21] would have him say it right there in
[1:59:22] that message and identify he says there
[1:59:24] i see the woman standing in a purple
[1:59:26] dress
[1:59:28] come on friends we also know it's
[1:59:30] speaking of the roman catholic church
[1:59:34] where did that show us we're at the
[1:59:36] seventh vision is
[1:59:37] the last vision when i heard a terrible
[1:59:39] explosion and i looked and i saw nothing
[1:59:42] but debris caters and smoke all over the
[1:59:45] land of america
[1:59:48] now let me just say this you heard that
[1:59:50] watch russia we see what's going on
[1:59:52] right now within the world
[1:59:55] i want to remind you when brother band
[1:59:56] will draw you know brother brown would
[1:59:58] pick up the
[1:59:59] over and over you'll hear him in the
[2:00:00] message he'll say what in the world's
[2:00:01] wrong with these preachers crying out
[2:00:03] against communism
[2:00:05] he said well i don't agree with it he
[2:00:07] said but it shows they're looking at the
[2:00:08] wrong thing
[2:00:11] see a trap of the enemy
[2:00:14] he said they're crying out against and
[2:00:15] everything he said what's wrong with
[2:00:17] them he said what they don't recognize
[2:00:19] that it's a tool in the hand of god to
[2:00:22] bring judgment on the
[2:00:28] see satan knows how to put smoke screens
[2:00:29] to get you looking at the right thing
[2:00:31] and he'll come right in the back door
[2:00:34] if he can get you looking at the wrong
[2:00:35] thing he'll come right in the front door
[2:00:38] that's why you must look unto jesus
[2:00:42] looking unto him looking for him if
[2:00:45] you're not looking for him looking for
[2:00:47] him down into him satan can come in so
[2:00:50] easily
[2:00:51] that's why brother branham could tell us
[2:00:52] and just just this statement like this
[2:00:54] he said the reality is he said russia is
[2:00:56] only one percent communism
[2:01:00] are you with me
[2:01:01] only one percent communism he said but
[2:01:03] it's the controlling percent
[2:01:05] let me finish it now
[2:01:07] he said well look hollywood's only one
[2:01:08] place but it's controlling
[2:01:12] he said he look at our churches
[2:01:13] two-thirds of people professed
[2:01:15] christians but hollywood has influence
[2:01:18] over them
[2:01:20] one little place has influence now he
[2:01:22] says look he says how that all of this
[2:01:25] control would come out he said now you
[2:01:27] would look at that he said and you would
[2:01:29] say one percent he said 99 of russia is
[2:01:33] still on the christian side but you see
[2:01:35] say how could he say that he said it
[2:01:37] over and over in the message he said
[2:01:38] what they need is a messenger a voice of
[2:01:41] god you know what that is they needed
[2:01:44] the ministry of malachi 4 in this hour
[2:01:48] to give them courage to stand up again
[2:01:53] because communism raised up because the
[2:01:56] church failed
[2:01:58] are you hearing me brother braham said
[2:02:00] the reason communism is in russia is
[2:02:03] because the church was there and they
[2:02:05] were failing to produce what the word
[2:02:08] set it off to produce
[2:02:11] and he said don't look clear over there
[2:02:13] he said look right here at home
[2:02:16] he said it's not the worm on the outside
[2:02:19] it's a worm in the core
[2:02:23] you say he said one percent how can one
[2:02:26] percent question answer in the seals how
[2:02:28] can one percent control 99
[2:02:30] he said that ought to explain it to you
[2:02:32] right there
[2:02:34] if god didn't permit it
[2:02:36] it'd be thrown out a long time ago
[2:02:42] because russia
[2:02:43] is going to be the one
[2:02:45] that brings her doom in one hour
[2:02:48] russia is going to drop the bomb the
[2:02:50] spirit of god spoke through the
[2:02:52] messenger of this hour and said thus
[2:02:55] saith the lord they will drop the bomb
[2:02:57] on the vatican
[2:03:01] so rome's not you know rome is to rule
[2:03:04] the world not communism
[2:03:07] are you hearing me
[2:03:09] boy i'm telling you
[2:03:11] it is amazing all of this can be right
[2:03:14] here
[2:03:15] you see that's why god has sent us a
[2:03:17] word within this hour to be zeroed in on
[2:03:20] what's taking place
[2:03:24] come on friends
[2:03:25] let me tell you something all the rest
[2:03:26] of these groups that's rising up listen
[2:03:29] to me now with the communistic themes
[2:03:32] don't focus on them
[2:03:34] or we're going to rid them out of our
[2:03:35] nation you're going to be left behind
[2:03:38] you got your focus on the wrong
[2:03:40] thing there will be no national
[2:03:43] repentance
[2:03:46] come on friends all of these things are
[2:03:48] inspired in that way but there's another
[2:03:50] inspiration that has come to the
[2:03:53] believer the rest of the world won't
[2:03:55] receive this inspiration it's not an
[2:03:58] inner inspiration to stay here it's an
[2:04:01] inspiration to leave here
[2:04:06] brother samuel that makes me sad sad for
[2:04:09] for what you see the country going
[2:04:10] through but do you shouldn't be living
[2:04:12] in sadness you ought to be living in the
[2:04:14] joy of the lord get your focus on the
[2:04:17] right things
[2:04:19] just say the lord get your focus on the
[2:04:22] right things
[2:04:25] hallelujah some of you know more about
[2:04:27] politics and you know about the message
[2:04:28] that's right shame on you you're
[2:04:30] backslidden
[2:04:32] i don't care how much you know about the
[2:04:34] politics you ought to be bearing your
[2:04:36] nose in the message you ought to be
[2:04:38] getting in the message you want to know
[2:04:39] more about what's going on brother
[2:04:41] samuel i come to hear it preach you
[2:04:43] ought to be getting into it there's no
[2:04:45] excuse it's on our phones it's
[2:04:47] everywhere all around us
[2:04:50] [Applause]
[2:04:55] brother samuel that's strong strong meat
[2:04:56] belongs to them that's full age
[2:05:04] it's a tool in the hand of god
[2:05:08] brother braham says there's three
[2:05:09] curtains you heard him say this
[2:05:13] as he said you've got he said the iron
[2:05:15] curtain
[2:05:17] the bamboo curtain
[2:05:18] he said but there's another curtain it's
[2:05:20] called the purple one that's the one he
[2:05:22] said you want to watch for
[2:05:24] it's going to take over and you be very
[2:05:26] careful it's so
[2:05:27] so deceitful
[2:05:29] he said oh everybody's scared about
[2:05:31] communism
[2:05:32] you see that's all that's a setup even
[2:05:34] for this hour
[2:05:35] i'm not going to touch that today that's
[2:05:37] a setup
[2:05:38] only but he says what communism is is
[2:05:40] it'll burn the with fire because
[2:05:42] it's playing right in the hands of god
[2:05:45] but he said
[2:05:46] you know as we're looking at these
[2:05:48] things
[2:05:49] he says don't watch the iron curtain
[2:05:51] meaning
[2:05:52] meaning russia
[2:05:54] bamboo curtain china
[2:05:55] but watch the purple current
[2:05:59] that's the one that's going to get you
[2:06:01] he said now communism is nothing in the
[2:06:04] listen to this statement a tool in the
[2:06:05] hand god's hand playing right up it
[2:06:08] won't amount to nothing
[2:06:11] don't fear about that
[2:06:12] that's listen to this statement now
[2:06:15] that's something to throw you off of the
[2:06:17] track of looking
[2:06:24] we can bring it down very very simple
[2:06:26] if satan can get our focus diverted
[2:06:30] he can come right in
[2:06:32] if he can get your focus in your home
[2:06:34] diverted
[2:06:36] he can come right into your home
[2:06:39] come on now
[2:06:41] you've got to keep your eyes centered on
[2:06:43] jesus christ
[2:06:45] it's to stay lined up not just well i
[2:06:47] believe the message no he's got to be
[2:06:48] lined up
[2:06:49] because if you're not focused on the
[2:06:51] right thing he can come right in
[2:06:54] come on friends
[2:06:56] this is where he says something that'll
[2:06:58] throw them off track and what they're
[2:06:59] looking for he said but don't you never
[2:07:01] foreseel don't you never watch
[2:07:03] communism
[2:07:06] but you see there's a heavenly sign
[2:07:10] i wish i had i wish i had strength to
[2:07:12] preach this right now
[2:07:14] there's a heavenly sign
[2:07:16] brother brad said all these other signs
[2:07:18] that's taken place
[2:07:20] he said there's another uniting that's
[2:07:22] going on amen
[2:07:23] and that's what i want to point you to
[2:07:26] amen
[2:07:27] there's another uniting that's going on
[2:07:31] come on friends god is uniting with his
[2:07:34] bride amen think of this uniting taking
[2:07:37] place where
[2:07:38] god himself a heavenly sign
[2:07:41] god come down
[2:07:44] according to his word
[2:07:46] and god stands here in revelations 10
[2:07:49] how the holy spirit descending down
[2:07:52] in a heavenly sign and god would
[2:07:55] manifest himself through the ministry of
[2:07:58] malachi 4 but remember that
[2:08:00] manifestation was only to announce
[2:08:04] he is the same
[2:08:06] and it's the same experience for the
[2:08:08] bride of jesus christ
[2:08:11] it's a heavenly sign i'm just gonna have
[2:08:13] to pull up there i just don't i just
[2:08:15] feel just to pull and stop right here
[2:08:17] lord willing we'll pick it up here again
[2:08:19] but i want you to to notice this here
[2:08:23] there is a heavenly sign
[2:08:25] and while the rest of the world
[2:08:28] they can look and they can see different
[2:08:30] signs
[2:08:32] earthquakes you can hear a lot of those
[2:08:34] things even among
[2:08:36] religious people
[2:08:38] and they would say things you see this
[2:08:39] sign we see this sign but you see the
[2:08:42] difference is when the word of the lord
[2:08:44] has come
[2:08:45] it identifies
[2:08:47] this is the season right now
[2:08:49] and there's a scriptural
[2:08:51] manifestation
[2:08:54] and with that scriptural manifestation
[2:08:56] is so that we might enter in to
[2:08:59] union
[2:09:01] with him who is the
[2:09:02] word let me say this in this hour we
[2:09:05] just we'd have to stop there i'm sorry i
[2:09:07] can't just feel just to just stop there
[2:09:09] i don't want to give you too much
[2:09:12] this is an hour friends
[2:09:15] there's no more playing church
[2:09:19] really to be playing church is is not
[2:09:21] the right thing to even go along with
[2:09:22] i'm just going to tell you
[2:09:25] don't be living off of a past experience
[2:09:26] either
[2:09:30] brother samuel i've seen the message was
[2:09:32] true years ago
[2:09:33] but do you if you really see it's true
[2:09:35] do you understand what it's pointing you
[2:09:36] to
[2:09:37] it's calling you
[2:09:39] to a real
[2:09:41] life
[2:09:43] not just to be associated around
[2:09:44] something
[2:09:46] but to be united with jesus christ
[2:09:51] because
[2:09:53] remember
[2:09:54] there is a call
[2:09:56] there is a word
[2:09:57] that goes out
[2:09:59] to bring us and to unite us together
[2:10:02] with with jesus christ that's a heavenly
[2:10:05] sign
[2:10:06] that the believer
[2:10:07] is in tune with don't i say it to you
[2:10:10] like this this is not an hour
[2:10:12] to just be content with coming to church
[2:10:15] that's right let me just say this yes
[2:10:18] don't you let the devil tell you that
[2:10:20] you can't have the same experience i got
[2:10:23] it
[2:10:23] oh brother samuel brother samuel i'll
[2:10:25] never be like you god don't want you to
[2:10:27] be like me
[2:10:29] you're to be like jesus
[2:10:32] and i want because i want you to
[2:10:33] understand brother samuel's fire ain't
[2:10:35] my fire it's the fire of god
[2:10:39] so what you see you can be a partaker of
[2:10:43] what is dealing with your life you can
[2:10:45] be a partaker up
[2:10:47] you see you can come you can hear and
[2:10:50] you can walk away you can come here and
[2:10:52] walk away but there's got to come a time
[2:10:55] to where you say
[2:10:57] enough is enough i'm tired of being me
[2:11:04] come on now we walked around this
[2:11:06] mountain long enough it's time to cross

[2:11:17] first thessalonians 4 the rapture the
[2:11:20] secret coming listen friends you talking
[2:11:22] about the rest of the world wanting to
[2:11:24] know what's going on but those that have
[2:11:26] set around this message that's true
[2:11:29] and you've set and you've heard it and
[2:11:31] the word has spoken to you and said you
[2:11:34] need to repent you need to get right you
[2:11:36] need to surrender your life and you will
[2:11:38] allow reasoning to hold you back well i
[2:11:41] don't know if i can i i don't know if i
[2:11:43] could do this and i don't understand
[2:11:44] this it's not asking if you understand
[2:11:47] he's asking do you believe will you do
[2:11:50] what he that is speaking to you is
[2:11:53] asking of you
[2:11:54] is to hear his voice
[2:11:57] it ain't about what you've been what are

[2:14:38] it's happened and you missed it
[2:14:44] brother samuel that scares me it
[2:14:45] shouldn't
[2:14:47] it should
[2:14:49] it ought to bring a warming to your
[2:14:52] heart amen because we don't know the day
[2:14:55] nor the hour you don't know the moment
[2:14:57] but it's to live ready
[2:14:59] so i want you to think of it how do you
[2:15:01] want him to find you when he comes
[2:15:05] because the coming of the lord is upon
[2:15:07] us
[2:15:08] you see if you really think of it we're
[2:15:10] saying i'm looking for the coming of the
[2:15:12] lord do you realize the coming of the
[2:15:13] lord he comes in your life daily
[2:15:16] he comes service after service
[2:15:19] it's a coming of the lord what's it
[2:15:22] doing it is as the promise said in
[2:15:24] revelations chapter 1 he will send waves
[2:15:27] of glory
[2:15:28] it's coming of the lord right then
[2:15:31] moving in upon the church of the living
[2:15:34] god
[2:15:35] it's a time if your focus has been is
[2:15:37] out of line it's a time to get it
[2:15:39] refocused friends
[2:15:41] you see there's got to come a time that
[2:15:43] within a life you know we speak about
[2:15:44] rededication and we should have a
[2:15:46] rededication the word of god calls us to
[2:15:49] that but i want you to be able to
[2:15:51] discern between dedication and
[2:15:53] rededication make sure you've had an
[2:15:56] original dedication with the fire of god
[2:16:00] you see this experience that god is
[2:16:02] giving to us in this hour it's not an
[2:16:05] experience that we say i can't wait to
[2:16:07] get back to church so i can repent again
[2:16:10] but this experience is a life that comes
[2:16:12] on the inside that brings deliverance it
[2:16:16] breaks the whole and the power of sin
[2:16:19] over your life so you're not walking
[2:16:21] around beat down and repenting of the
[2:16:23] same thing over and over and over you
[2:16:26] weren't made to be the tail you're
[2:16:28] ordained to be the head you were made to
[2:16:31] be the master of that and rule over it
[2:16:33] this is the day
[2:16:39] let the let the worldly image be mixed
[2:16:43] but let us be united
[2:16:46] let the worldly image be mixed
[2:16:50] well it's got worldly strength that
[2:16:52] strength of the iron behind it
[2:16:54] but it's weak
[2:16:56] the brittleness of clay
[2:17:00] think how paul would word it
[2:17:02] in second corinthians chapter four
[2:17:05] he said we preach not ourselves
[2:17:08] but christ jesus
[2:17:10] and we have this treasure
[2:17:12] in earthen clay
[2:17:14] vessels
[2:17:16] that the power
[2:17:18] may be of god and not of us
[2:17:21] oh it's something about it when the
[2:17:23] power of god comes on the inside that's
[2:17:25] the strength the lord is the strength of
[2:17:27] my life he's the strength that projects
[2:17:30] himself through this clay this clay is
[2:17:33] weak this clay gets down this clay gets
[2:17:35] discouraged this clay experienced
[2:17:37] sicknesses this clay can feel fear this
[2:17:40] clay can experience worry but that
[2:17:42] strength on the inside oh my it's a
[2:17:45] power in this hour that's able to stand
[2:17:48] there against every flood of the enemy
[2:17:50] that he would bring your way
[2:17:54] i'm talking about a hidden power in your
[2:17:56] life let me tell you something don't
[2:17:57] leave from here if you don't have that
[2:18:00] it's an hour to receive it
[2:18:02] prepare your heart it's not something
[2:18:04] you just say well i don't know if god
[2:18:06] will give it to me you might as well
[2:18:07] stay in your seat he won't do it like
[2:18:08] that
[2:18:09] but let me just give you the scripture
[2:18:11] for this is the promise unto you
[2:18:15] you repented been baptized in the name
[2:18:17] of the lord jesus christ if you have it
[2:18:19] that's the commandment that's are the
[2:18:21] orders that's preparation and you shall
[2:18:24] not maybe not might but you shall
[2:18:27] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[2:18:29] the promise is unto you and them that
[2:18:32] are far off as many as the lord our god
[2:18:35] shall call don't you realize the call
[2:18:37] that's going on in your life is the holy
[2:18:40] spirit calling you to himself
[2:18:43] [Music]
[2:18:44] it's drawing you
[2:18:47] so you can stand
[2:18:49] with a real clarity
[2:18:50] and repent lay it all down and welcome
[2:18:53] his presence
[2:18:55] into your life
[2:18:58] let's pray
[2:19:01] father
[2:19:05] lord jesus
[2:19:10] your presence lord is so
[2:19:13] so sweet lord
[2:19:16] hear lord if we can say
[2:19:18] in the closing moments
[2:19:20] that we are living in lord
[2:19:24] lord god
[2:19:26] the things that we see going on around
[2:19:28] us even reports i read here in the
[2:19:29] beginning
[2:19:32] where you would speak lord through the
[2:19:34] prophet when he would speak of that in
[2:19:36] the third vision watch russia watch
[2:19:38] russia
[2:19:40] and yet the understanding of that
[2:19:43] is don't focus
[2:19:45] on russia
[2:19:47] see signs around us taking place
[2:19:51] lord things that
[2:19:52] come around
[2:19:55] the lord jesus
[2:19:57] how we can see
[2:20:00] lord just how subtle the enemy is
[2:20:04] we see lord god right in here
[2:20:06] in our own country
[2:20:09] started out lord as a lamb
[2:20:11] [Music]
[2:20:14] the lord god had had two horns
[2:20:16] [Music]
[2:20:17] civil
[2:20:18] and ecclesiastical
[2:20:22] we see where we're at lord right now
[2:20:25] lord god just receiving just even a
[2:20:29] a news clip lord from another minister
[2:20:31] here
[2:20:32] just the other day
[2:20:34] if we're in finland
[2:20:37] one of their government officials is
[2:20:39] going to prison
[2:20:41] even a minister
[2:20:43] because they tweeted out
[2:20:47] a scripture
[2:20:49] from the word of god
[2:20:51] out of the book of romans that speaks
[2:20:53] against
[2:20:54] sodomite condition
[2:20:55] [Music]
[2:20:57] and the man on the cast
[2:21:00] is that of a lawyer from texas
[2:21:03] and he said
[2:21:05] get ready
[2:21:07] that's what's coming here
[2:21:09] [Music]
[2:21:10] lord jesus
[2:21:13] we know one thing your prophet told us
[2:21:16] he said the bride will not be closed up
[2:21:19] shall be taken out
[2:21:21] now lord i'll leave that in your hands
[2:21:25] [Music]
[2:21:28] they might take our churches i don't
[2:21:30] know i know the prophet spoke of those
[2:21:31] things
[2:21:33] but i also know that the one thing that
[2:21:34] he told us to be focused on
[2:21:37] from 1954
[2:21:39] all the way through
[2:21:40] he said the thing that i see next for
[2:21:42] the church of the living god
[2:21:44] is the rapture
[2:21:49] lord that's where we're focused
[2:21:52] now lord jesus i pray across this
[2:21:54] congregation
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:21:56] surely lord god i do not believe that
[2:21:59] these people
[2:22:00] have come here this morning
[2:22:02] to be seen
[2:22:04] i don't believe lord god they come here
[2:22:05] lord
[2:22:06] to see me
[2:22:08] but there's a drawing lord that's going
[2:22:10] on
[2:22:12] there's a yearning lord
[2:22:15] something that's far greater than the
[2:22:16] work of man
[2:22:18] the lord i don't know what they would
[2:22:20] have need of in their life
[2:22:21] [Music]
[2:22:24] i know lord jesus if they have never met
[2:22:26] you
[2:22:27] face to face
[2:22:29] they need to meet you
[2:22:32] because this world has nothing to offer
[2:22:36] the lord god continues to get worse
[2:22:39] and worse and worse and worse there's
[2:22:42] there's no turning around
[2:22:44] for the world
[2:22:46] but for you my brother my sister
[2:22:49] this is a precious opportunity of the
[2:22:52] mercy and grace of god
[2:22:55] the bible would say
[2:22:58] to forsake your thoughts
[2:23:01] and to receive the thoughts of almighty
[2:23:03] god
[2:23:06] if i was you this morning and i was
[2:23:07] sitting here in that place in that
[2:23:08] condition this is what i would do i
[2:23:11] would cast down my reasoning
[2:23:13] i'd cast down every doubt
[2:23:16] i'd cast down every voice that is
[2:23:18] speaking
[2:23:19] contrary to the voice of god
[2:23:22] because the voice of god this morning
[2:23:24] that you have heard
[2:23:25] that's went beyond your natural hearing
[2:23:28] and that's moved down there to discern
[2:23:30] your heart that's a voice of life
[2:23:34] those other voices are voices of death
[2:23:37] voices that would want to keep you
[2:23:40] and hinder you
[2:23:42] but why don't you accept the voice of
[2:23:43] liberty
[2:23:45] the voice of freedom
[2:23:46] the voice of jubilee the voice this
[2:23:49] morning that you can be free
[2:23:53] you don't have to carry that load of sin
[2:23:55] no more
[2:23:56] you don't have to carry that lord what
[2:23:58] do i do release it unto the lord jesus
[2:24:00] christ
[2:24:02] repent
[2:24:03] let it down
[2:24:05] and say god i give my life to you
[2:24:08] i give it to you lord
[2:24:10] i surrender my life lord
[2:24:14] lord god i want the holy ghost
[2:24:17] lord jesus i want it more than anything
[2:24:19] i want every head bowed if you wouldn't
[2:24:21] mind every eye closed
[2:24:24] i wonder how many hands throughout the
[2:24:26] building hearts that would be on us say
[2:24:28] brother samuel pray for me
[2:24:31] pray for me
[2:24:33] now i'm not going to do all the praying
[2:24:35] i want you to pray with me
[2:24:37] but hearts and lives that even right now
[2:24:40] remember when you're raising your hand
[2:24:41] it's more than just your hand but a real
[2:24:44] designation
[2:24:45] because behind some of these hands
[2:24:47] there's there's the request lord i want
[2:24:49] the holy ghost
[2:24:50] i'll tell you a couple with that right
[2:24:52] there say god let my heart be prepared
[2:24:54] to receive you lord god
[2:24:56] give me the grace lord god that my heart
[2:24:58] has prepared to receive you lord
[2:25:01] i want my life o god to be on fire with
[2:25:04] you lord i want to be changed lord god
[2:25:08] oh god
[2:25:11] heavenly father
[2:25:12] [Music]
[2:25:14] lord jesus
[2:25:17] your mercy lord
[2:25:21] is right here with us
[2:25:24] lord i pray god
[2:25:27] that right there lord jesus
[2:25:30] lord upon that heart dear god may it be
[2:25:32] a real pouring out lord to you lord
[2:25:35] lord god is not just something lord
[2:25:37] jesus that we lord god or just
[2:25:40] would be just saying the lord are real
[2:25:42] pouring out of our heart lord knowing
[2:25:44] that god is your desire
[2:25:46] to fill us with the holy ghost it's your
[2:25:48] desire to change us lord it's your
[2:25:51] desire that is the heart of the message
[2:25:53] o god is to get into christ
[2:25:56] lord jesus
[2:25:58] what courage lord that your children
[2:26:00] would have to raise their hand
[2:26:02] father i know there's a blessing o god
[2:26:04] and the blessing of the holy ghost lord
[2:26:06] to move down in their life a courage
[2:26:08] lord god that would cause them to raise
[2:26:11] up and say i doubt all of my doubts i
[2:26:13] need to be born again of the spirit of
[2:26:16] god i want to be born again i want my
[2:26:18] life to be changed
[2:26:20] i've known about the message i've heard
[2:26:22] about god
[2:26:24] but i need the holy ghost
[2:26:27] oh god granny lord this morning
[2:26:31] may the lord not look for a sensation
[2:26:34] may they not look for a feeling
[2:26:36] but may lord god there not be a ceasing
[2:26:39] lord in their hearts until down on the
[2:26:42] inside there's such a satisfaction and a
[2:26:45] death to the things of the world lord
[2:26:47] god to where there's nothing of the
[2:26:49] world that's left there lord god but
[2:26:51] it's been consumed by the fire of
[2:26:54] almighty god where their life has become
[2:26:56] a sacrifice
[2:26:58] oh granted lord
[2:27:00] may they lord god just pour themselves
[2:27:02] out continue to pour themselves out
[2:27:06] or lord god as they are honest in your
[2:27:08] presence
[2:27:09] you'll move for them lord
[2:27:14] i wonder how many this morning say i've
[2:27:15] got a loved one
[2:27:17] i've got children
[2:27:18] got a wife got a husband i've got loved
[2:27:20] ones
[2:27:22] but i i desire the holy spirit to go out
[2:27:24] for
[2:27:26] to turn around they're to get their
[2:27:28] attention
[2:27:31] they'll say i mean you don't know how
[2:27:32] bad they are how bad were you
[2:27:35] you don't know how steep than sin they
[2:27:37] are but nothing's too far for jesus
[2:27:40] hallelujah
[2:27:42] he went down into that pigpen and he
[2:27:45] turned that prodigal son's heart away
[2:27:47] right around
[2:27:48] why can't we just join together right
[2:27:50] now
[2:27:51] and say holy spirit the enforcer of god
[2:27:54] god gave you those children not to be a
[2:27:56] they're they're to be a blessing to you
[2:27:59] god gave you those children they're your
[2:28:01] inheritance
[2:28:03] don't allow the enemy to tell you well
[2:28:05] then they're they're going the opposite
[2:28:06] way they'll never make it in you stand
[2:28:08] there on god's word and you claim them
[2:28:11] as part of your inheritance
[2:28:14] and let's ask the angel of the lord to
[2:28:16] deal with their heart
