[30:44] grateful to the Lord for His mercy
[30:46] aren't you and I'm so glad to be in the
[30:49] house of the Lord once again tonight man
[30:52] we just want to go right into the word
[30:54] and turn our attention there you'd like
[30:56] to stand with me let's go to first
[31:04] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12
[31:18] I just felt pressed of the Lord last
[31:21] Thursday after the service and I haven't
[31:24] been able to get through that quote at
[31:27] all and I just felt pressed to the Lord
[31:31] and praying and kept looking and putting
[31:34] things down and Friday and then Saturday
[31:36] the whole day was dealing with dealing
[31:40] with this and I want to just take of it
[31:43] we take like uh maybe an intermission on
[31:46] the loyalty of your heart and look at
[31:50] that because we know that all of that is
[31:52] the loyalty of our heart is what is
[31:55] displayed through them through the midst
[31:58] of the trial but yet in the end before
[32:02] the trial itself I want to look here at
[32:05] a thought on the truth of the trial the
[32:10] truth of the trial so first Corinthians
[32:13] chapter 10 verse 12
[32:15] look how Paul deals with with the
[32:18] believers bringing them from everything
[32:20] that God has brought Israel through
[32:23] coming out of the land and verse 12
[32:26] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[32:30] standeth take heed lest he fall there
[32:37] have no temptation taken you but such as
[32:41] is common to man but God is faithful who
[32:45] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[32:47] that you are able but will with the
[32:51] temptation also make a way of escape
[32:54] that you may be able to bear it
[32:57] notice this next verse and how that this
[33:00] is length right in here it's not
[33:02] oddly places its divinely placed
[33:04] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[33:10] idolatry wherefore my dearly beloved
[33:17] flee from idolatry
[33:22] idolatry we know is that which is not
[33:25] the truth
[33:27] it's not true it's not real there's only
[33:31] one that is true and that is real that's
[33:34] gone is that right let's just bow our
[33:38] heads in a word of Prayer our Heavenly
[33:41] Father we come before you tonight Lord
[33:46] we've the Lord opened the lids of this
[33:50] Bible and we've read Lord of your word
[33:53] but father we need more than just
[33:56] looking at Lord and reading the letters
[33:58] we need you Lord there author to come
[34:02] tonight Lord and to speak to our hearts
[34:04] Lord and now Lord God not only giving us
[34:08] understanding the Lord God within your
[34:11] word but father that your presence would
[34:14] just set down here tonight Lord in each
[34:18] and every one of our lives and our
[34:19] hearts and Lord calls us to have an
[34:22] understanding of application we pray
[34:26] that Lord that you will just speak to us
[34:29] tonight Lord and just take us Lord
[34:31] completely Lord into your your control
[34:34] in your hands Lord for the next few
[34:36] moments Lord we pray Lord we just give
[34:39] ourselves to you now and we ask Lord for
[34:42] every request and every need Lord
[34:44] I think of Lord here today I received
[34:47] Lord a text from brother David crest jr.
[34:49] Lord you know the need there in this
[34:52] body Lord with this blood pressure right
[34:53] now I pray that God that you'll just
[34:56] strengthen him Lord as he's resting
[34:58] there Lord at home under doctor's orders
[35:00] I pray that God that the Spirit of God
[35:02] would just move for him tonight Lord God
[35:05] calls those numbers Lord God to be
[35:08] lowered Lord to where they need to be
[35:10] out pray father and Lord just touching
[35:12] his body Lord of that sinus affection
[35:15] Lord that Lord has come against him Lord
[35:17] you know the needs of each and every one
[35:19] Lord and Lord perhaps there's more Lord
[35:22] but you know each and every one and we
[35:24] just asked tonight Lord that you would
[35:26] touch each and every heart and every
[35:28] life Lord ministering to every need Lord
[35:31] we pray those of us that are present
[35:33] those that are streaming those that
[35:35] we'll even have to go
[35:36] Lord and archiving Lord we ask it now in
[35:39] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[35:41] and may God blesses your being seated I
[35:46] find that that that verse of scripture
[35:49] I've always found that verse of
[35:50] scripture to be peculiar I dealt with it
[35:52] different times but when I look at how
[35:56] that when Israel remember when they come
[35:59] out of Egypt and they came out and it
[36:02] was indeed with not only with the blood
[36:06] but truly with with great power and
[36:09] there was great joy among them when they
[36:12] had come out of Egypt and with we would
[36:16] have maybe been able to ask them at
[36:19] first when they came out of Egypt it
[36:21] would have been much just like in our
[36:23] journey when God first came to our lives
[36:26] and God brought deliverance to us and no
[36:30] doubt within many of their lives you
[36:32] think of how many miracles and
[36:33] supernatural things that has taken place
[36:36] within their life but now there's gonna
[36:39] be times within the journey that they're
[36:41] gonna be brought to testing times
[36:44] there's gonna be situations that God
[36:47] will actually allow and permit and
[36:50] actually will guide them into places
[36:52] that where there's no other way for them
[36:55] to get out we know the Red Sea we know
[36:57] the the bitter waters and we see all of
[37:00] that and you know you you think of it
[37:02] many times of how that we still will
[37:06] look at it of how that God would would
[37:08] speak here in fleeing from idolatry no
[37:12] doubt about it that the people when they
[37:14] left Egypt they never ever thought they
[37:17] would have to go through or encounter
[37:19] some of the things they encountered
[37:21] never thought they would have to do that
[37:23] and then when these things came along
[37:25] their way no doubt it was it was things
[37:28] that we know they rose up and said why
[37:30] why is this happening and I don't
[37:32] understand this and and through the
[37:34] midst of the tests and trial it wasn't
[37:37] that that it weakened Israel it actually
[37:40] strengthened Israel there was weeding
[37:43] out that took place in the midst of the
[37:45] testing times there were all of those
[37:47] things that had
[37:49] taken place during those times but yet
[37:51] in the midst of it there was a reality
[37:55] that we're in that for them there was a
[37:58] need to be rafflesia and yet it's deeper
[38:02] it's so much deeper than that of the
[38:04] golden calf because idolatry itself is
[38:07] just even a thought and you know that
[38:09] you and I can get within our thoughts
[38:11] and thoughts themselves can become
[38:13] thinking they can become that of where
[38:15] an image can begin to be crafted and
[38:18] idea and all that lays right there
[38:20] within the imagination that's the very
[38:23] framework and how things can begin to
[38:26] can be contrived and brought together
[38:28] there's not one person in here tonight
[38:30] that you haven't thought wrongly about
[38:33] something and you maybe have thought
[38:35] about it and then you went ahead and
[38:36] acted upon what you thought and then it
[38:38] comes down to the to the end result of
[38:41] it you you acted wrongly and what you
[38:43] acted wrong on you acted wrong on what
[38:45] you thought or perceived and we know
[38:48] that within it that God's desire is not
[38:51] that you and I would would walk by our
[38:54] own contrived perceptions and you know
[38:57] if we get to looking at the things like
[38:59] brother Branham told us he said you are
[39:01] putting before the people as though that
[39:04] it's a flowery bed of ease and just come
[39:06] and serve the Lord and all your troubles
[39:08] are solved and you'll have no more
[39:10] tensions he said that is not the truth
[39:12] you add tension when you become a
[39:16] Christian
[39:17] you don't there's not an alleviation of
[39:19] trials as a matter of fact as the
[39:21] Prophet would put it like this he said
[39:23] you were just slopping along when you
[39:25] were out in the world but he said as
[39:27] soon as you say that I've got the Holy
[39:29] Ghost he said every gun out of hell is
[39:32] trained upon you then so there's a
[39:34] testing it's a trying it's approving and
[39:38] and God as we've looked at this here in
[39:40] some previous services God loves to
[39:42] bring the testing and the trying to is
[39:45] to his children in first John 5:20 one
[39:48] would even reiterate you know little
[39:50] children keep yourself from idols and
[39:52] when I look at this I always think of
[39:54] many different places brother ran
[39:56] would speak about them in idles and how
[39:58] easily things can be crafted but I look
[40:01] at the message the unchangeable God and
[40:03] brother Bev said it like this he said
[40:05] the thing is with people is the way God
[40:07] appears many times we want to make an
[40:10] idol out of God we ask God to do
[40:13] something and then he must do it just
[40:15] the way that we ask it or we'll say he
[40:19] never answered when we do that we weaken
[40:23] our faith in God and we weaken our
[40:26] testimony when we do not take him at his
[40:29] word God always answers in that the
[40:34] truth God always answers no one ever
[40:37] asked he said jesus said ask and you
[40:39] shall receive seek and ye shall find
[40:42] everyone that asks will receive everyone
[40:45] that seeks shall find everyone that
[40:47] knocks
[40:47] it'll be open to them now that's the
[40:49] only way that I've always found it that
[40:52] I can get anything from God he has take
[40:54] him at his word and believe it the way
[40:57] he sends it now if we do not take it
[41:00] just that way that we think it is we've
[41:03] built God as an idol he's got to answer
[41:06] just according to our ways well it's
[41:09] just no good he did answer us God
[41:11] answers in many ways he answers in
[41:14] peculiar ways times and everything is
[41:18] odd all in the moulding and the making
[41:27] and you there's a lot of things with
[41:29] that Dollar Tree as they as I said that
[41:31] even sometimes in our mind we we
[41:33] recognize that God I tell you in my own
[41:36] life right now God is more real to me
[41:39] now than he was when I first met him he
[41:42] is more real now I can tell you that the
[41:45] distances of things that happen if I can
[41:47] say miraculously where the supernatural
[41:51] it's not an everyday thing that's not
[41:55] that way with any believer that's the
[41:58] book of X the book of Acts was over men
[42:00] he wasn't over days it was over
[42:03] years but you see if if all of those
[42:07] times if those things God allows it to
[42:10] be in those proving times that you and I
[42:13] can be tested and proven and to think
[42:16] what if it what kind of an idea I want
[42:19] you to think of this what kind of an
[42:20] idea would you have of God
[42:22] if every time you were sick God healed
[42:26] you and you never had to go to a doctor
[42:28] never had to take a medicine you're what
[42:31] you would develop within that is say
[42:34] that you know what real faith is you
[42:36] don't have to go to a doctor and that's
[42:39] an idol that's not true there are many
[42:44] things in the messages that brother
[42:45] Branham says your first duty when you're
[42:47] sick is to go to your doctor multiple
[42:50] times you said it so it's not that a
[42:52] person has more faith but you see
[42:53] sometimes there's things that are idols
[42:56] where people are giving themselves too
[42:58] and I'll just say it like this we all
[43:01] need to continually be cleansed of the
[43:04] Lord and in one of these things right
[43:06] here is even looking at how that trials
[43:09] themselves and what is really the truth
[43:12] of what a trial is all about and we we
[43:15] look at that here that how that James
[43:17] would speak of and I want to just pull
[43:19] out a few words here in James chapter
[43:21] one verse two my brethren count it all
[43:24] joy when you fall into divers
[43:26] temptations now notice the word count it
[43:28] means to consider deem account or think
[43:32] of it think of it consider it this way
[43:35] this is the way that your to think of it
[43:37] when these things have come about
[43:39] knowing this that the trying of your
[43:42] faith worketh patience in first Peter
[43:46] chapter four verse twelve there's a few
[43:48] words I want to look at in here he says
[43:50] beloved think it not strange concerning
[43:53] the fiery trial which is to try you
[43:57] what's he dealing with they're thinking
[44:01] because if Satan can get him in their
[44:03] thinking you'll defeat him he'll whip
[44:07] them because of the thinking he listened
[44:09] to a real child of God born again and
[44:12] sealed by the Spirit of God
[44:13] he'll never
[44:14] move that person from God no you can't
[44:18] separate them that's impossible but what
[44:23] but within the midst of it that the
[44:26] thinking about things to understand what
[44:28] is going on and this is where Peter said
[44:31] think it not strange concerning the
[44:34] fiery trial which is to try you as
[44:36] though some strange things happened unto
[44:40] you like what's going on I know I
[44:44] understand I understand
[44:46] that even as being mature Christians and
[44:49] years on down the road that it is and
[44:51] all of a sudden when a trial shows up
[44:53] that you or I have become so mature that
[44:56] automatically we kick in gears oh it's
[44:57] just the trial v here that will happen
[45:02] that would it's something that
[45:05] immediately if it does something's wrong
[45:06] because immediately as a believer you go
[45:09] to check where you're standing with the
[45:11] Lord that's the first thing you do
[45:14] checking where you're standing we know
[45:16] that our sacrifice is perfect but you
[45:19] begin to check in your life and knowing
[45:21] that God if there's anything there God
[45:23] will bring that out but then you can
[45:25] begin to see when something will come
[45:27] out and you can begin to recognize wait
[45:29] a minute wait a minute this is a trial
[45:34] this is a test it doesn't mean that at
[45:38] that point in time we say okay mom we're
[45:40] just going continue to go about business
[45:41] and my everything is just happening and
[45:43] hunky-dory and whatever more no but
[45:45] neither doesn't mean that we are are
[45:47] down and moving down in the mullet
[45:49] groves you might get down joke got down
[45:51] but God's grace is sufficient to pick
[45:53] you up and God might have to pick you up
[45:56] today pick you up tomorrow pick you up
[45:58] the next day pick you up the next day
[45:59] you say I just seen that man going
[46:02] through a trial he was rejoicing
[46:03] yesterday he's down in the dust but you
[46:05] let all of a sudden something drop in
[46:08] his heart about the Lord you'll hear
[46:10] praise come out of there
[46:13] hmmm
[46:15] he'll give glory to God this is not
[46:17] about a show or put all I know we
[46:20] understand that but fake it not strange
[46:23] of the fiery trial and that strange that
[46:26] first word that's there the two
[46:28] strangers they're not the same think it
[46:30] not strange as there's something that's
[46:32] a surprise or astonished by the novelty
[46:36] of the thing to be surprised as tavad
[46:39] astonished at the novelty or strangeness
[46:41] of a thing that as as as a believer that
[46:44] we're going to be tested and tried
[46:46] absolutely we're going to be tested and
[46:49] tried and we are being tested and tried
[46:51] listen to me friends
[46:53] we're being in tested and tried by every
[46:55] word of God
[46:58] that's this bride is being tested by
[47:01] every word of God take it not strange
[47:06] notice the next part as something that
[47:09] is a like an alien from a person or
[47:11] thing without the knowledge or without a
[47:13] share in to be unheard of like what is
[47:16] this that's going on and you know Israel
[47:18] was like that when things come up well
[47:20] what is this what's going on why did you
[47:23] lead us to bitter waters we said we were
[47:26] thirsty don't you know where that clear
[47:29] Springs are at why we were asking for
[47:31] fares you lead us to bitter waters God
[47:35] knows what he's doing
[47:36] God is trying anything he's making
[47:39] himself known again and again how many
[47:42] of you want God to make himself known
[47:43] again and again I want God to continue
[47:46] to make himself known to me and in my
[47:48] life right here in this church and then
[47:51] in the midst of all that that were
[47:52] asking God to continue to make himself
[47:54] known he's not going to make himself
[47:56] known in a status of comfort oh my god
[48:03] we'll take things right out of the nest
[48:05] bill event says if God don't take things
[48:07] out of the nest
[48:08] he said that little baby could say oh my
[48:10] mom was so great oh my mom is so great
[48:12] hold on he said he don't know how great
[48:14] his momma is but he said when mama gets
[48:17] her things out of the nest and that
[48:19] little one gets to fly then he said when
[48:22] they gets to fallen it's not able to
[48:24] someone catch itself mama sweeps in he
[48:27] said he's never saw mama with them wings
[48:30] before like that
[48:31] he's never saw mama come out like that
[48:34] but you see what it is mama has quite
[48:37] brought about or allowed a situation
[48:40] that she might make herself known in a
[48:44] way that that little Eagles never know
[48:47] mama before so think it not strange oh
[48:51] my love this is tremendous but rejoice
[48:54] in as much as ye are partakers of
[48:56] Christ's sufferings that when his glory
[48:58] shall be revealed you may be glad also
[49:01] with exceeding joy and you look at how
[49:05] that in three kinds of believers let me
[49:08] read a little bit more here in this
[49:09] quote and come back over a few areas
[49:11] I've covered he said joke went through
[49:14] the trials and the tests his children
[49:17] taken everything else taken the church
[49:19] members come and accused him of being a
[49:21] secret center and tried to say
[49:23] everything against him but yet he
[49:25] wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed
[49:27] he had met God's requirements he know
[49:29] there's no need of Satan trying to tempt
[49:32] him he knowed it was the devil and what
[49:36] did he know was the devil trying to come
[49:39] against the sacrifice he knew that's the
[49:42] devil and as long as Satan can make him
[49:47] believe that his sickness was his God
[49:50] doing it
[49:51] he had job with what was the devil
[49:53] trying to do for a wedge put a wedge
[49:57] between job and God they're right but
[50:04] when job once struck that revelation
[50:06] that it was not God he was only going
[50:10] through his trials to make him something
[50:12] it wasn't God doing it it was Satan
[50:15] doing it and the same thing today he'll
[50:18] try to tell you these trials and things
[50:20] is your God trying to put punishment
[50:23] upon you it isn't so no sir it's Satan
[50:28] doing that and God permitting it to
[50:31] temper you to make you see if you're
[50:34] tied to this earth by the earth cares
[50:37] or whether your treasures is in heaven
[50:38] for wherever your treasure is there you
[50:41] are also your heart is where your
[50:43] treasures are now look out the brother
[50:46] branham brings us out and recognising
[50:48] your day and its message and he's
[50:50] talking about how that God comes and God
[50:53] vindicates his word he said job never
[50:57] recognized that it was God as long as
[51:01] the devil can make you believe some time
[51:03] that the little trials you go through is
[51:06] God punishing you it was God trying to
[51:10] show him something job never recognized
[51:13] it till he saw a vision and like Moses
[51:17] when Moses saw the vision the pillar
[51:19] find their bush it was vindicated so
[51:24] where where was job being whipped not on
[51:28] his sacrifice he was being whipped in
[51:32] his thinking because Satan was telling
[51:38] him it was his God that was punishing
[51:42] him ah you know I said back there you
[51:45] know sometimes I put him put a lot of
[51:47] different notes but I got to looking at
[51:48] one part in I thought why did I put this
[51:50] part in here why did I put this in here
[51:53] in the inspiration on Saturday back on
[51:55] Saturday morning why was I and I got to
[51:58] looking at I didn't include it in the
[51:59] notes there but I got to looking at that
[52:01] and and what I'm looking at is how that
[52:03] it was in God you have to remember that
[52:06] God Himself when we look at the term of
[52:09] punishment there's one there's a place
[52:11] in the scripture that speaks of
[52:12] punishment and it speaks of those who
[52:14] are set to depart into everlasting
[52:17] punishment but God brings correction
[52:21] that all right the Prophet Blaise it
[52:26] very clearly like this you just have to
[52:28] follow me on this out of the church age
[52:30] book he says he says to his own as many
[52:32] as I love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke
[52:35] is to reprove and to reprove is to
[52:39] expose with a view to correction now now
[52:42] look at that to reprove is what expose
[52:45] for what reason for correction
[52:48] not reprove that it might just leave you
[52:50] bet but it's to expose for correction
[52:56] Jason does not mean to punish what what
[53:03] in sight by the Spirit of God into the
[53:05] word Jason does not mean to punish it
[53:09] means to discipline because the subjects
[53:12] amendment is in mine so when God is
[53:17] chastening it's not God punishing it's
[53:22] correction that is coming but Faris
[53:25] there must be reproof and as reproof
[53:29] comes then God his discipline is always
[53:32] with the vision and what God is doing
[53:35] think of how that God has brought a word
[53:38] in this hour and here we are feeding on
[53:41] that word and the Holy Spirit bringing
[53:43] that word down here into our lives and
[53:46] bringing application to us instructing
[53:49] you and I by his Spirit
[53:50] leading us in this hour to think of it
[53:53] of how that the Holy Spirit has given
[53:56] and in this hour if it had not been
[53:58] given in that way we would not be where
[54:01] we are today because what the discipline
[54:05] there of the word to stay in it every
[54:08] time just like when you're disciplining
[54:10] your children it's disciplining or
[54:13] things that that are corrected it's
[54:15] because of what you can see in the
[54:18] future
[54:19] it's not about they're annoying me
[54:20] they're bothering me that's that's not
[54:23] that's not discipline but discipline we
[54:25] understand that is with the subjects
[54:28] amendment in mind looking ahead into the
[54:31] future and if this goes on now where
[54:35] will it be Zin
[54:36] is that right so here that's how God God
[54:42] is preparing he trains you and I because
[54:45] even when you look in the scriptures in
[54:48] Hebrews chapter 12 if I can just refer
[54:51] to a few places there you find of how
[54:53] that the Spirit of the Lord
[54:55] moving through Paul in rend Hebrews 12
[54:58] would bring
[54:59] there the distinction of the chastening
[55:01] and the rebuke despise not when without
[55:06] the chastening of the Lord and here when
[55:09] we look at the chastening chastening is
[55:12] not just just correction where in terms
[55:15] that there's contact that's made but
[55:19] it's as a matter of fact we we
[55:21] understand that and I'm just going to
[55:22] just preach it but it's something that
[55:24] it's called it's ongoing there is so
[55:27] many opportunities even throughout a day
[55:30] would you it with your children and even
[55:33] in the hours if they go to school and
[55:34] here they are told there's so many
[55:36] opportunities to instruct and to
[55:38] admonish them and so many different
[55:40] things to show them different things
[55:42] talk to them about different things you
[55:45] understand well they don't know how to
[55:48] change the tire on a lawnmower
[55:49] did you ever show in the same don't get
[55:54] upset with somebody when another brother
[55:56] shows them how to change the tire but
[55:59] you see it's just all of these things
[56:01] are a part of it little things that can
[56:02] be being be shared that's all chastening
[56:05] and it's things that are our our
[56:08] guidance and direction upon things right
[56:10] now to help guide and train the
[56:13] individual alone so it's even having a
[56:16] correct view of even looking of that of
[56:19] really what chastening is I'm not going
[56:21] to stay too long on that here but how
[56:24] that God Himself within it
[56:26] we understand that chastening is not to
[56:29] punish God is interested in bringing
[56:32] about maturity in our lives this is why
[56:36] that the Prophet after coming through
[56:38] that of the molding and the making there
[56:41] even within Hebrews twelve he would
[56:43] speak of how that God's desire is in
[56:46] love a family of his own a family of
[56:49] sons sons like himself he said therefore
[56:53] all all before him lies all mankind as
[56:57] one lump of clay and out of the same
[56:59] look he will now make vessels unto honor
[57:01] and under dishonor the choosing will be
[57:04] his choosing
[57:05] you know God don't make one man
[57:07] dishonorable and another honorable
[57:11] but the same that he just said right
[57:13] there that he will now make vessels unto
[57:15] honor and to dishonor
[57:16] but God don't make people dishonorable
[57:18] and other people honorable but the
[57:21] presence of his word his life only
[57:24] ripens what is there that's all I can do
[57:28] God does not mean take pigs and make
[57:31] sheep out of them come on somebody he
[57:34] reveals to the sheep that's they're
[57:36] living like a pig that you are not a pig
[57:38] you are a sheep right you never became a
[57:42] sheep on a certain day but being a sheep
[57:46] you were called and brought to God
[57:48] through the process of justification
[57:51] sanctification and the new birth that
[57:56] shows you are she then those chosen ones
[58:00] born of his spirit will be trained to
[58:03] conform to his image in their walk how
[58:08] how could I ever train these boys
[58:12] if I never had them if they hadn't been
[58:14] born how can I train them they won't
[58:18] understand they wouldn't understand my
[58:19] ways they wouldn't understand the things
[58:21] I'm saying but there had to come a birth
[58:24] first and there are things that have
[58:26] company when they were born there were
[58:29] things that fit it at that time
[58:33] just like God knows how to fit things at
[58:36] our time
[58:38] God knows just how when we are in need
[58:41] and he knows just what we're able to
[58:44] handle well I know sometimes we think we
[58:47] can really handle this and handle that
[58:48] and God I could really handle this but
[58:50] you see God knows what you and I really
[58:53] are able to handle because there ain't
[58:57] none of us and nobody is above Apostle
[59:00] Paul are you with me but Paul himself
[59:04] had to continue as God allowed that
[59:07] reoccurrence with his eyes over and over
[59:09] why did God do that why did he do it
[59:15] here's a prophet of God a servant of God
[59:19] an apostle why did God do that what does
[59:21] our Bible say less
[59:23] I should get insulted but isn't he a
[59:29] child of God shouldn't he be able to
[59:31] keep himself in subjection there is a
[59:34] measure where God himself has required
[59:37] of you and I to keep our lives in
[59:39] subjection by the indwelling of the Holy
[59:42] Spirit and yet God in His great mercy
[59:44] and grace permits trials and tests to
[59:49] come our way to do what keep us in a
[59:51] place of humility depending on him lest
[59:57] I should become exalted hey man so
[1:00:03] there's a training I mean let me just
[1:00:05] move on when you look at how these
[1:00:08] things were job in the midst in the
[1:00:11] midst of this time there's been a
[1:00:15] conversation that has taken place in
[1:00:17] heaven joke doesn't know about it his
[1:00:23] buddies don't know about it I don't care
[1:00:25] how spiritual they were they didn't know
[1:00:27] it you with me
[1:00:30] here is Joe standing as a prophet of God
[1:00:33] and God here when the sons of God have
[1:00:37] come to present themselves Satan comes
[1:00:39] with them and now aren't you looking for
[1:00:45] a time we're no longer signal no longer
[1:00:47] be around you I am
[1:00:52] notice this in job chapter 1 verse 8
[1:00:55] here the Lord said unto Satan that's not
[1:01:00] considered my servant joke have you
[1:01:02] looked at him have you thought about him
[1:01:06] who are you talking about not just Joe
[1:01:08] my servant Joe have you considered him
[1:01:13] that there is none like him in the earth
[1:01:17] a perfect and an upright man one that
[1:01:21] fears God and eschewed evil there's no
[1:01:25] doubt about it this man was full of
[1:01:27] mistakes just like you and I are but how
[1:01:30] was how was God able to stand here and
[1:01:32] say he's a perfect man because Joe
[1:01:35] had a perfect faith in a perfect
[1:01:37] revelation of a perfect sacrifice and he
[1:01:40] moved with obedience and God was looking
[1:01:43] at the sacrifice because that's where
[1:01:45] job was standing hallelujah the devil
[1:01:51] was not going to get job away from the
[1:01:53] sacrifice hallelujah
[1:01:57] it would be easier to cut him over it
[1:02:00] and take his heart out you cannot
[1:02:02] separate the uniting of God by the
[1:02:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost with it yes a
[1:02:08] seal that's been pressed there on the
[1:02:10] soul there is nothing that can come
[1:02:13] between in that soul getting in the
[1:02:19] spirit working through those things well
[1:02:22] that's where we have to stand and stand
[1:02:26] and don't allow and say Lord if there's
[1:02:29] anything Lord pearls Clin not know what
[1:02:34] I'm saying right you can get weak in
[1:02:37] your spirit you falter in your spirit
[1:02:40] you can say it man or not but I've seen
[1:02:44] every one of you enough now to know when
[1:02:46] there's times you're down in times when
[1:02:48] you're up and you can be ready just like
[1:02:50] a book that's the truth now remember
[1:03:01] don't get out of that idolatry but I
[1:03:04] mean if you went through the tenth wait
[1:03:05] wait a minute
[1:03:06] that's idolatry because everybody the
[1:03:10] tests and trials that come remember it's
[1:03:13] personal
[1:03:14] temptations I do not have to go through
[1:03:16] the exact trial that brother Joey went
[1:03:19] through brother joy does not have to go
[1:03:20] through the exact trial - adilyn through
[1:03:22] but that do have to be tried and I am
[1:03:25] being tried he has to be tried and God
[1:03:28] knows exactly what he's doing
[1:03:30] this ain't no Sears and Roebuck harmony
[1:03:33] house if God made us
[1:03:35] a variety god knows each and every one
[1:03:37] of us he knows our temperament he knows
[1:03:39] our makeup these tests and trials are
[1:03:42] not just things that scattered out like
[1:03:44] 50 to pick up these trials are designed
[1:03:48] and tailor-made for you and I it isn't
[1:03:53] just what what why would this fall my
[1:03:55] way oh no how did these bitter waters
[1:03:59] come no see before we can ever get to
[1:04:05] rejoicing in understanding the glory of
[1:04:07] all the value of what their trials about
[1:04:10] we can't have the the thinking of what
[1:04:13] what's this going on what's this
[1:04:15] happening I'll tell you how powerful
[1:04:18] this is
[1:04:18] brother man preach in the Hebrew series
[1:04:20] brother Ram said just after in Hebrews 4
[1:04:22] he said just after I got done preaching
[1:04:24] this morning about Israel complaining
[1:04:26] and asking God why and why and why and
[1:04:29] why over he said I had people come
[1:04:31] tonight in the prayer line asking me why
[1:04:37] what's he doing he's pointing to church
[1:04:39] you didn't hear what the words were
[1:04:40] saying this morning
[1:04:42] the world was trying to help you but you
[1:04:44] were so blocked off in what was going on
[1:04:47] in your life well I said instead of
[1:04:49] giving yourself in prostration to God
[1:04:51] they were prostrating to an idol whoo
[1:04:55] because there's flatline is how was this
[1:04:58] going on this can't be going on to a
[1:05:00] child of God
[1:05:01] what have I done wrong what no no it
[1:05:03] isn't that you've done anything wrong
[1:05:05] it's that God Himself has been bragging
[1:05:08] on you
[1:05:12] whoo you know friends this is this is
[1:05:19] the truth it amazes me I I don't
[1:05:21] understand how that in the midst of a
[1:05:24] time or in the midst even in the
[1:05:25] services when the word is coming forth
[1:05:27] when you're giving yourself to the word
[1:05:29] to me these are things it's not
[1:05:31] coincidental there are things that even
[1:05:33] when I look back through that he
[1:05:34] over the course of even last week coming
[1:05:37] into this we bet our messages that even
[1:05:39] I was listening to at that time that the
[1:05:41] Spirit of God was quickening statements
[1:05:44] over and over that was ministering to me
[1:05:46] during that time and causing my fate to
[1:05:50] increase what was it it was the word who
[1:05:55] on the feeling below tender and say
[1:05:59] that's exactly right Lord oh my he just
[1:06:02] since said just a sir just you know just
[1:06:04] a real peace right there
[1:06:06] thank you Lord for your word so Satan
[1:06:14] took everything around me all of his
[1:06:19] possessions children everything around
[1:06:23] him he didn't touch his wife what they
[1:06:35] were one glory he come there and notice
[1:06:42] here's job after all this is done the
[1:06:47] Bible says at the end of that chapter
[1:06:48] joke continued on in all this he sinned
[1:06:51] not foolishly in all of this he was
[1:06:59] still going on he was still standing
[1:07:03] steadfast in the word Satan said here he
[1:07:07] is the Saints sons of God come again to
[1:07:10] present themselves and Satan says he up
[1:07:13] was about time to go to the house of God
[1:07:14] I'll go so here he presents himself and
[1:07:20] notice how God says this in verse three
[1:07:22] he adds a little bit of a dragon to it
[1:07:26] how many you want gone to brag on you
[1:07:31] some people have both hands are setting
[1:07:33] out of there
[1:07:35] this is the results of God bragging on
[1:07:38] you when you're going through a test go
[1:07:41] through a trial God's been bragging on
[1:07:43] you but see our minds don't think that
[1:07:47] way see job's not thinking this way but
[1:07:50] my greatest God you know he's not
[1:07:52] thinking this way and the Lord said unto
[1:07:56] Satan verse 3 of job - hath stopp'd
[1:07:58] considered my servant job that there is
[1:08:01] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[1:08:03] an upright man one that feareth God and
[1:08:06] eschewed evil and steals look at God
[1:08:08] testified still he hold it fast his
[1:08:11] integrity although that moves me against
[1:08:14] him to destroy him without cause God's
[1:08:18] testified of who he is and testified of
[1:08:21] how he's standing in the midst of the
[1:08:24] circumstance
[1:08:25] well my but Satan wasn't done things
[1:08:29] that you letting me touch his life man
[1:08:34] will give everything for his health for
[1:08:37] his life God said go ahead but you can't
[1:08:42] take his life
[1:08:44] you can afflict him but you cannot take
[1:08:47] his life see God has the boundary set he
[1:08:49] will not suffer you to be tested tempted
[1:08:53] above what you're able to bear see this
[1:08:57] wasn't God saying oh my goodness I
[1:08:59] wonder if job's gonna be able to do this
[1:09:01] I hope so oh oh my goodness somebody can
[1:09:03] bring me more fingernails to chew I hope
[1:09:05] Jobs gonna make it know what is God what
[1:09:09] is God reason how can God stand like
[1:09:12] this is it because of the flesh of job
[1:09:14] does he have a pedigree within his flesh
[1:09:17] was as his as genetics celebrate his
[1:09:20] manda solicitude that joke can remember
[1:09:22] scripture here scripture there scripture
[1:09:24] here is that what God got faith in no
[1:09:27] but job what does God have faith in his
[1:09:31] servant is hiding and abiding in the
[1:09:34] sacrifice that has been revealed by
[1:09:37] we beat a god so here you have one of
[1:09:52] these good friends it comes by and he's
[1:10:02] got the solution these guys came I don't
[1:10:08] know how long they preached to him and
[1:10:12] they were just rattling it one right
[1:10:14] after another here is a life as in joke
[1:10:16] fine he is telling joke that you're
[1:10:21] trying the trial what's going on it's
[1:10:25] God punishing you and it's because
[1:10:27] you're a sinner you've got sin in your
[1:10:31] life now look how your life has stands
[1:10:39] and speaks this behold happy is the man
[1:10:41] whom God corrected that is true is that
[1:10:45] right hello is that the word there
[1:10:48] therefore despise not the chastening of
[1:10:50] the Almighty that's the word wrong
[1:10:52] application that's the word but a wrong
[1:10:56] application why is it a wrong
[1:10:59] application lack of understanding lack
[1:11:02] of understanding who Oberlin Samuel
[1:11:04] these people understand God but they
[1:11:05] don't understand the sacrifice to the
[1:11:07] true depth see they don't know the depth
[1:11:11] of that sacrifice so they only know God
[1:11:14] according to the depth that they know
[1:11:16] the sacrifice in for he maketh sore and
[1:11:22] Banda thug he wounded and his hands make
[1:11:25] whole we can say Amen to all of that but
[1:11:29] yet they have no understanding in what
[1:11:30] they're saying but how that these
[1:11:33] individuals continue to speak to job
[1:11:36] over and over one right after another
[1:11:39] one right after another brother Brent
[1:11:41] says after Satan got doing got done got
[1:11:43] done with what he
[1:11:45] doing he said Satan removed himself but
[1:11:47] here the friends remained you get the
[1:11:50] faith who was worse
[1:11:54] these are church folks come on somebody
[1:11:58] these are individuals that that that
[1:12:00] jump on the set
[1:12:01] brother Eli fast brother bill death move
[1:12:04] somebody these are individuals but you
[1:12:06] get to look anything my lord I mean this
[1:12:08] is where they're coming and the things
[1:12:11] that they're speaking about what they
[1:12:12] don't realize that they're coming and
[1:12:14] they're talking about his sacrifice now
[1:12:21] what's this in the message in the
[1:12:23] message fellowship brother Brett says
[1:12:25] job a righteous man a godly man
[1:12:28] everything against him one day Satan
[1:12:30] took a notion to make him deny God he
[1:12:33] said I love to read Joe many people say
[1:12:35] it's a riddle
[1:12:35] it isn't it's the Word of God Jesus
[1:12:37] referred to JoVE about have you heard
[1:12:39] the patience no matter what was going on
[1:12:42] how much he was persecuted how much he
[1:12:45] was called that he was in the wrong path
[1:12:47] job stayed packed on the world I like
[1:12:51] that he said peradventure my children
[1:12:53] have sinned I'll offer a sacrifice for
[1:12:56] them now the only thing the man knew was
[1:12:59] the burnt offering that was God's
[1:13:01] requirement and many people think
[1:13:04] sometimes because disaster happens to a
[1:13:07] Christian oh he got off the will of God
[1:13:09] they left the church they went out
[1:13:11] sometimes that's not right
[1:13:22] thinking what's he dealing with idolatry
[1:13:25] thinking and that's thinking here's the
[1:13:28] thing here's the part not only is it
[1:13:30] damaging toward the individual that
[1:13:33] would be going through the trial but who
[1:13:35] it's really damaging it's down because
[1:13:39] what happens to them when their trial
[1:13:41] comes their way then it's really gonna
[1:13:44] be the world is this you remember
[1:13:52] brother branham nd in the adoption
[1:13:55] series there is be talking about
[1:13:57] bringing the things everything coming
[1:14:00] into a maturity we understand that
[1:14:02] bringing the people into the birth into
[1:14:04] the land and then in the maturity and
[1:14:06] standing there strong with the faith in
[1:14:09] the sacrifice and then he begins to
[1:14:11] break off right in there and I think
[1:14:12] it's also in taking sides with Jesus he
[1:14:14] talks about how that people write their
[1:14:16] they'll say this right there at the
[1:14:19] Brennan Tabernacle to show you that
[1:14:21] there was not anything that was immune
[1:14:22] their brother bran was not talking to
[1:14:24] people just out here in organization
[1:14:26] this message is to us this message is to
[1:14:29] us it applies to today that's exactly
[1:14:35] right that's why even everything with
[1:14:37] organization and denomination it is it
[1:14:40] were beyond though it applies to today
[1:14:43] it's a discerning of any spirit that is
[1:14:47] contrary to the true atonement that
[1:14:53] right but many had thought brother
[1:14:56] branham's accident with the gun they
[1:15:00] thought he addresses it they've got
[1:15:04] something wrong there then he says and
[1:15:06] some of you thinking with brother
[1:15:07] Neville had the bad car accident
[1:15:09] something was wrong there you see I
[1:15:13] don't believe that the people mean to be
[1:15:15] that way it's the lack of understanding
[1:15:17] it isn't that you or me or whatever
[1:15:19] would would have to mean to be thinking
[1:15:22] in this way I don't believe that nobody
[1:15:24] wants to think this way but you can see
[1:15:26] how that a thought pattern can just
[1:15:28] start and it Kurt starts going and then
[1:15:30] before the person themselves it takes
[1:15:33] place then there in defeat what do i do
[1:15:38] what do I do
[1:15:41] God's punishing me the Lord's against me
[1:15:46] let me tell you something it seems like
[1:15:49] that I noticed this over the years and
[1:15:52] when I've dealt and talked right here
[1:15:54] and I've talked in other places as well
[1:15:55] where sometimes we're individuals
[1:15:57] they'll go in and how they'll say well
[1:15:59] that devil been bothering me all about
[1:16:01] my past and things from things you know
[1:16:03] years ago and whatever more that's as a
[1:16:06] true statement the devil is not God if
[1:16:12] you're repented of it and put it in the
[1:16:14] blood of Jesus Christ it's been put
[1:16:17] there it's not to be remembered no more
[1:16:25] but sometimes this would things in
[1:16:27] things that where the enemy will come
[1:16:28] and he'll come against people upon those
[1:16:30] things well this is why you're going
[1:16:32] through this it's because of this is
[1:16:33] because of that that God's got a case he
[1:16:35] can lay it out but know where you stand
[1:16:40] in that you've met God's requirements
[1:16:43] and when you know your standard me
[1:16:45] you've met God's requirements you can
[1:16:47] stand on that and allow God to bring
[1:16:49] delight you when you need it on the
[1:16:52] trial that you're going through you know
[1:16:56] sometimes the trials that you go through
[1:16:57] even right now you even when you come
[1:17:00] out of them you can't come out of the
[1:17:01] trial say you know what I know this
[1:17:03] trial this trial was it made me this way
[1:17:04] because five years from now five years
[1:17:06] from now I'm gonna be doing this and I'm
[1:17:08] gonna be doing that and so that's the
[1:17:09] why they come here and let's deflate you
[1:17:14] a little bit it'll happen that way
[1:17:20] God didn't do his profits and nobody
[1:17:22] else that way so he don't expect you to
[1:17:26] walk that that your victory in a trial
[1:17:28] is that you know all job could say I
[1:17:30] know when I come through this I'll come
[1:17:34] forth this pure soul that's what I know
[1:17:37] he did not know whoa this other been
[1:17:40] awaited him but I know I'm
[1:17:42] come forth purest gold knew that many
[1:17:47] people think sometimes he says because
[1:17:49] disaster happens to a Christian he got
[1:17:51] off the will of God they left the church
[1:17:52] they went out sometimes that's not right
[1:17:55] now notice I says it sometimes it's not
[1:17:56] right
[1:17:57] you know God loves people so much he
[1:18:01] loves his children then even when they
[1:18:04] themselves somebody might get so
[1:18:06] discouraged and yeah you know within
[1:18:08] their walk and maybe they they're not
[1:18:10] where they're and the enemy just poured
[1:18:12] in honestly you'll never have that
[1:18:13] you'll never live a victorious life and
[1:18:14] they just feel like you know what I'm
[1:18:16] just giving up and they hear they they
[1:18:18] backslide on God but God's love will
[1:18:21] reach out to them and if they won't heed
[1:18:24] to it God will bring correction to drive
[1:18:28] them back somebody it could be a
[1:18:32] sickness it'd be a disease and God will
[1:18:34] permit that to bring them back man I've
[1:18:41] watched it I've seen it
[1:18:43] I thank God I don't think God for the
[1:18:46] sickness or the disease no more than you
[1:18:47] do but what I thank God for is that
[1:18:49] there was one Satan you thought you had
[1:18:52] you never had him you never had her
[1:18:56] little repeater God ain't that wonderful
[1:18:59] God just reaches down it some matches in
[1:19:01] right away what Satan got he had in the
[1:19:03] goodie bag and take it home new
[1:19:07] sometimes that's not right because God
[1:19:09] chastens every son that comes to him he
[1:19:13] cleanses him purchase him tries to see
[1:19:16] if he will stand that's what he was
[1:19:19] doing in the time of job in the evening
[1:19:22] messenger he said now remember job all
[1:19:24] of his trials that wasn't God chastening
[1:19:27] job it was God approving his servant so
[1:19:33] it all worked for good you see when the
[1:19:35] book of Job was wrote for all
[1:19:37] generations for a testimony look at that
[1:19:39] now for a testimony God's working it for
[1:19:43] God
[1:19:45] in the message Victor day I'm just
[1:19:48] trying to move forward here now remember
[1:19:52] God has
[1:19:54] did you worthy when you have a test this
[1:19:58] is the truth of the trial don't fail to
[1:20:02] get this get this when you have a trial
[1:20:04] or test it shows the grace of God has
[1:20:08] found you found favor with God and God
[1:20:10] believes that you'll stand the test Wow
[1:20:19] in another part here in a victory day
[1:20:21] right on down when it looks like I love
[1:20:27] that when it looks like it ain't when it
[1:20:30] looks like everything has gone wrong God
[1:20:33] is giving you a trial hey don't just
[1:20:37] give you individually he gives the
[1:20:38] church a trial
[1:20:41] sure he does hello he'll bring everyone
[1:20:46] is trying it's proving it's showing as a
[1:20:49] matter of fact the brother Brenda makes
[1:20:50] us so clear he said the church that is
[1:20:52] not suffering is the church that don't
[1:20:54] got it dealing with idolatry there he
[1:21:01] says you know even he said he's got
[1:21:03] confidence in you he don't have to baby
[1:21:05] you around you're not a hotbed plant a
[1:21:09] hybrid you're a real Christian nah I
[1:21:13] like good strong plants don't you not
[1:21:16] like strong plants
[1:21:17] I don't like plants that are wimpy and
[1:21:20] weak and finicky and whatever more I
[1:21:22] don't I don't plant them I don't like
[1:21:25] them I like things that as we know them
[1:21:27] are Hardy now just because they're Hardy
[1:21:30] doesn't mean they don't need tender
[1:21:32] nourishing care they need care they need
[1:21:36] a lot more care even in the beginning in
[1:21:39] the initial setting of the roots but
[1:21:42] after that has the planet set here to
[1:21:45] continue to go up you don't have to be
[1:21:47] babied around you might forget to prune
[1:21:50] it this season oh well it'll be all
[1:21:52] right you're a real Christian not a
[1:21:58] hotbed plant a hybrid God has given you
[1:22:01] a test see what you'll do about it no
[1:22:03] wonder Peter said these fiery trials
[1:22:06] like
[1:22:07] and all joy it's more precious to you
[1:22:08] and gold many times we harm and haul
[1:22:11] that can't be a new song coming home oh
[1:22:14] well if I just well well that's
[1:22:16] something God give you something God
[1:22:19] give you to overcome the same if I want
[1:22:26] to be an overcomer then there's things
[1:22:28] to overcome well I believe that I have
[1:22:31] already overcome you have already
[1:22:33] overcome the world if you've been born
[1:22:35] of the Spirit of God you've already
[1:22:36] overcome the things of the world and as
[1:22:39] the overcomer is in you he manifests
[1:22:41] himself as an overcomer through you to
[1:22:46] overcome he knows you'll do it he's put
[1:22:48] trust in you and the message the
[1:22:51] approach to God he said if you ever
[1:22:53] noticed he said when disaster struck
[1:22:55] job's home the children was all killed
[1:22:58] and everything job all job had was
[1:23:01] destroyed God wasn't rebuking job he was
[1:23:05] only purging job well he said Amen I
[1:23:09] like that word purge the branch that
[1:23:12] bears fruit than God purges it that
[1:23:15] it'll bring forth more fruit the trouble
[1:23:18] of it is we think sometimes God's angry
[1:23:23] with us we think what's the trouble we
[1:23:28] think you mean the troubles not the
[1:23:30] trial no the trouble is we think through
[1:23:34] trials not to travel the trial is the
[1:23:37] instrument or the tool to bring forth
[1:23:40] the product that's why I said last week
[1:23:43] when the inspiration struck just even
[1:23:44] about this right here you don't see the
[1:23:48] Saul's the table saw everything the
[1:23:50] ruler the level the the screwdrivers the
[1:23:53] router you don't see that up here I'm
[1:23:55] not preaching behind those tools I am
[1:23:57] preaching behind a production those
[1:24:00] tools were used to make and the trial
[1:24:04] itself is tools that are given to bring
[1:24:09] forth that image out of our life it
[1:24:16] purges
[1:24:17] that purge I got the look and you know
[1:24:19] and you think of how a purge a purge
[1:24:22] itself it gets rid it's a cleansing in
[1:24:24] John 15 verse 1 he said I am The True
[1:24:27] Vine and my father is the husbandman
[1:24:30] every branch in me that beareth NOT
[1:24:33] fruit he taketh away in every branch
[1:24:35] that beareth fruit he purges it that it
[1:24:38] may bring forth more fruit some of you
[1:24:43] that have fruit trees or those of you
[1:24:44] it's worked with him you know there's
[1:24:45] got to be pruning you don't prune them
[1:24:48] there will be no producing but they've
[1:24:51] got to be pruned and it's not just
[1:24:53] snipping them off but there is a method
[1:24:56] to it
[1:24:56] I'm not professing to know it but I do
[1:24:59] know that there's a method to and I know
[1:25:00] the one thing with the fruit tree you
[1:25:02] got to open it up so the light gets in
[1:25:04] the center you have to open it your
[1:25:07] pruning that tree a man is able to look
[1:25:09] at that one who would stand there within
[1:25:11] those orchards and grow in those things
[1:25:13] he knows exactly how to prune and those
[1:25:15] things to prune off whereas for you and
[1:25:17] I we would look at and say why are you
[1:25:18] pruning this one instead of this one
[1:25:19] right here why are you taking away this
[1:25:21] part of the branch and not this one over
[1:25:23] here what but he knows what he's doing
[1:25:25] why he's after a yield of more fruit
[1:25:30] that's why he's purging that's why the
[1:25:32] cleansing that's why the movie and you
[1:25:34] realize that even in that word purge I
[1:25:36] got to looking at that word purge you
[1:25:38] realize what purge is it's even to
[1:25:40] remove an unwanted feeling to remove to
[1:25:45] purge to get rid of to cleanse God purge
[1:25:52] Paul he was purging life that God
[1:25:57] himself that that word - the humility
[1:25:59] could continue to flow forth and that
[1:26:02] word that God had given oh my and the
[1:26:08] approach to God I I'm closing he said
[1:26:11] here's a little thing I want you to
[1:26:13] notice after all the turmoil and
[1:26:17] everything was over God had taken all of
[1:26:20] his sheep his cattle his horses and
[1:26:23] things then at the end of his
[1:26:25] chastisement or purging God TT
[1:26:30] if he had 10,000 cattle he give him
[1:26:33] 20,000 pounds in their marvelous God
[1:26:37] perch Jill for the purpose to bless you
[1:26:43] the trial was to purge that yard my
[1:26:47] blessing
[1:26:50] you say brother Brennan I'm a Christian
[1:26:52] and I got a sickness now I wonder why
[1:26:56] God may be purging you give you some
[1:27:00] trials make you draw a little closer
[1:27:03] together pray awhile then you heal you
[1:27:08] pray awhile then he heal you you see
[1:27:15] this isn't just he makes a way that we
[1:27:23] might be able to bear it's not an exit
[1:27:30] door out of it nor which one of these
[1:27:33] walls are was one of these walls were
[1:27:34] halted no that's not the way that he
[1:27:38] makes out of it
[1:27:39] His grace is sufficient to guide and
[1:27:42] direct us through it make you draw a
[1:27:48] little closer to him pray awhile then
[1:27:50] heal you that you can have a testimony
[1:27:53] Christ heals you you say well I heal I
[1:27:57] heard he healed others he said but then
[1:28:00] you're the husband men is the partakers
[1:28:02] of the fruit then so it's no longer than
[1:28:05] what you've heard but now I see he is a
[1:28:10] healer I no longer heard he's a
[1:28:13] deliverer I know he's a deal
[1:28:22] he restoreth nice aren't you glad
[1:28:32] through the trial through the test oh my
[1:28:35] I'm glad that he restored my brings
[1:28:45] everything you look everything else
[1:28:47] it was doubled around it was the
[1:28:50] blessing that came after the purging but
[1:28:55] the child the purging was not God
[1:28:59] punishing Joe but it was God heard you
[1:29:05] removing it was God approving Joe yes
[1:29:11] sir this is the truth of the trial
[1:29:17] suffer a little while then after he said
[1:29:21] I establish you each and every one that
[1:29:25] cometh to God Hebrews twelve declares
[1:29:28] this and it is the truth your tests it
[1:29:31] and you try and you can even witness
[1:29:34] this as an individual that the moment
[1:29:41] how a person will turn and God has
[1:29:44] touched your life and you surrender your
[1:29:45] life to the Lord yes that God has called
[1:29:47] you may the light might steal at all
[1:29:49] sorts of all world within it but your
[1:29:53] heart has been turned to the Lord and
[1:29:57] there will be afflictions there'll be
[1:29:59] things that have come right at you see
[1:30:04] what are you gonna do you're gonna turn
[1:30:07] around or are you gonna keep pressing on
[1:30:09] to say I know that God who who spoke to
[1:30:13] my life
[1:30:14] I believe that that promise is for me
[1:30:20] so you keep you stand there and you you
[1:30:23] keep making another step chasing in
[1:30:29] comes correction comes but you stand
[1:30:33] there and say I want to be a vessel in
[1:30:38] his service sir you don't know what you
[1:30:43] have to go through in order to to come
[1:30:44] into here but I want to be in his
[1:30:47] service think of what the Queen of Sheba
[1:30:53] when she looked at Solomon's house I
[1:30:58] want you to understand this she saw the
[1:31:01] working she saw the discernment but then
[1:31:06] when she turns to behold
[1:31:08] he's beholding his house she sees the
[1:31:11] conduct the Bible says that she noticed
[1:31:14] even how the servants carried the meat
[1:31:20] and what a blessed thing she said it is
[1:31:23] to be in this house she noticed every
[1:31:26] detail or was it the effects of the
[1:31:30] Living God to believe and know that
[1:31:33] living God the supernatural God was
[1:31:37] present to train his children to conform
[1:31:41] to his image in their walk no doubt
[1:31:46] there was purged and it was cleansing
[1:31:47] but all was for the glory of God it's
[1:31:50] the truth of the trial simple but it's
[1:31:54] true say North cast down any idol cast
[1:32:00] down any slot Lord he's not against me
[1:32:04] he is for me
[1:32:06] if God be for us who can be against us
[1:32:11] senator what's the value of that so that
[1:32:13] you can count it all joy count it all
[1:32:21] joy so that you can do as the scripture
[1:32:25] said rejoice in these things
[1:32:37] Lord Jesus
[1:32:43] what do we thank you for your word
[1:32:45] tonight lord thank you Lord Jesus how
[1:32:53] the Lord that you speak to our hearts
[1:32:56] upon these things Lord God just to me
[1:33:06] Lord even in the profoundness of it it's
[1:33:08] things that it's not Lord our memory
[1:33:14] it's not our memory it's not our memory
[1:33:18] of these things Lord because Lord just
[1:33:21] just memory alone doesn't pack power the
[1:33:26] father to think back and lord when
[1:33:31] things Lord would come about I'm so
[1:33:33] thankful so thankful Lord for your
[1:33:38] presence Lord and how that you would
[1:33:40] draw near and direct us Lord in the
[1:33:43] midst of these things Lord that right
[1:33:45] here that where Lord were not walking as
[1:33:51] Lord as as believers and why why is this
[1:33:57] happening
[1:33:59] Lord God there may be Lord questions but
[1:34:03] Lord in our hearts what is the most
[1:34:06] important thing is being established in
[1:34:09] you Lord understanding that we need Lord
[1:34:14] even in that of the trial will get it
[1:34:19] Lord when we need it but in the midst of
[1:34:23] it Lord our testimony is that father in
[1:34:26] all things you are faithful Lord I'm so
[1:34:30] thankful for that but that's just not
[1:34:32] words I'm grateful Lord for that
[1:34:33] resounding reality Lord that father in
[1:34:37] the midst of it Lord or we can stand say
[1:34:41] Lord I don't know how but I know I'm
[1:34:46] gonna be stronger I know we're gonna be
[1:34:48] stronger I don't know how this is your
[1:34:51] word and your word I'm just standing on
[1:34:53] your word as you have said it would but
[1:34:57] after we've suffered then ulis been
[1:34:59] establish us Lord God I pray tonight
[1:35:08] may we take Lord from that refreshment
[1:35:10] Lord from your presence coming through
[1:35:12] the word and I pray that Lord you give
[1:35:16] strength and give comfort away now Lord
[1:35:19] tonight maybe perhaps Lord maybe perhaps
[1:35:22] it was just for one Lord I don't know
[1:35:24] but if that be so which I know that
[1:35:28] you'll do things just for one person you
[1:35:31] called Philip away from a revival for
[1:35:35] one person you kept the Lord Jesus and
[1:35:39] directed him to the well of samara for
[1:35:41] one person so I want to thank you lord
[1:35:48] it just shows how great your love and
[1:35:51] care is that's your love and care it's
[1:35:54] not based on the number that needed the
[1:35:57] Lord I find in my own heart Lord that
[1:36:00] even as these things were dropping Lord
[1:36:02] right after the service that you pressed
[1:36:04] on my heart lay this out next Thursday
[1:36:11] lord I thank yous I look through these
[1:36:14] things Lord I never you know my heart I
[1:36:16] don't study Lord based on knowledge but
[1:36:20] it's based on inspiration sometimes Lord
[1:36:23] that inspiration sometimes it comes I
[1:36:25] just it floods down then there's other
[1:36:29] times the Lord we're just waiting
[1:36:31] praying looking to you
[1:36:33] nonetheless Lord I rejoice in your word
[1:36:37] Lord and I want to say thank your father
[1:36:41] Lord for the truth of the trial
[1:36:45] it doesn't take the trial away it
[1:36:48] doesn't take the circumstances or the
[1:36:50] tests the Lord God it helps us to look
[1:36:54] at it with a right understanding Lord
[1:36:57] and then we can look up to you Lord who
[1:37:00] gives grace sufficient for what we have
[1:37:04] need of grace that is measured to meet
[1:37:09] what we need in this moment Lord God no
[1:37:14] doubt sitting here Lord some of your
[1:37:17] children Lord different trials and tests
[1:37:19] that they are are facing and they're
[1:37:21] going through right now in their own
[1:37:23] life maybe Lord it's something that
[1:37:25] would be on a job a family something
[1:37:28] Lord God long maybe it finances or you
[1:37:31] you know the need maybe its sickness
[1:37:32] Lord in their body I pray Lord God here
[1:37:38] tonight Lord just taking that word and
[1:37:40] applying it and Lord God just entering
[1:37:42] in with the worship Lord to be able to
[1:37:45] say thank you Lord I'm thankful what God
[1:37:48] for your grace or God where I have I
[1:37:51] found favor in your eyes but lord I need
[1:37:53] grace to go through this trial would I
[1:37:57] need grace Lord honor I'm not asking you
[1:38:00] to take the trial away I'm asking you
[1:38:04] just to give me the grace that I need to
[1:38:08] go through
[1:38:10] Lord Jesus I'm thankful for that
[1:38:13] the Lord God there's not one of us the
[1:38:15] Lord God
[1:38:17] Lord God when we begin to see the real
[1:38:20] value of it we don't want to dodge our
[1:38:22] trials Lord we don't want to dogs trials
[1:38:25] because we realize the Lord and these
[1:38:28] are instruments tools that have been
[1:38:34] selected to be able Lord to shape mold
[1:38:42] to temper to purge to cleanse all of
[1:38:49] those things Lord that your glory might
[1:38:53] be reflected in us not for our sake but
[1:38:57] for thy sake are we killed all the day
[1:39:01] long we love you Lord Jesus that you
[1:39:06] might be reflected in our lives what I
[1:39:10] want to ask you I'll start right here
[1:39:12] I'll ask you Lord I ask you on behalf of
[1:39:15] everyone in your Lord forgive us when we
[1:39:19] have complained
[1:39:20] forgive us Lord God that in the midst of
[1:39:23] when that trial that test arises Lord
[1:39:26] God that disturbs what we consider our
[1:39:29] tranquility our peace forgive us Lord
[1:39:33] because that's what we're really come
[1:39:35] that's what we're complaining about I
[1:39:36] ask you Lord forgive me Lord and father
[1:39:40] God with each and every one that would
[1:39:42] want to be remembered Lord in this
[1:39:43] prayer I ask you Lord God to forgive
[1:39:46] them Lord as well
[1:39:48] or do we realize this Lord but we know
[1:39:52] that God it must be more than us our
[1:39:54] knowledge it is in our knowledge that
[1:39:56] kicks in in these times Lord the father
[1:39:59] it's that understanding Lord that hole
[1:40:02] that anchor that in the midst Lord when
[1:40:05] our mind could go a certain way you know
[1:40:08] Lord thank you at that direction that
[1:40:12] rests within our heart that I know I
[1:40:15] know that God is in control Lord we love
[1:40:21] you we thank you tonight Lord I pray the
[1:40:25] Lord you'd strengthen each and every one
[1:40:26] Lord if there's one here tonight that
[1:40:29] doesn't know you Lord may I pray that
[1:40:31] God that they would surrender their
[1:40:33] heart in their life to you father for
[1:40:37] you give strength you give Lord an
[1:40:40] anchor that holds in the midst of the
[1:40:45] storm thank you Father
