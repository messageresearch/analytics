[22:45] and we trust you
[22:48] you know exactly what our needs are lord
[22:51] and father whether you calm the storm
[22:54] or you calm us lord
[22:56] we ask the lord that you would just have
[22:59] your way for every request that's upon
[23:01] the hearts of your children tonight
[23:04] may you lord help me that i could step
[23:07] out of the way
[23:08] and this congregation lord
[23:10] that father it wouldn't even be in our
[23:12] minds

[23:26] same almighty god hallelujah and so lord

[23:57] us together lord that we'd be able to
[23:59] step aside tonight and that right here
[24:02] lord in this service lord a real a
[24:05] supernatural lord reality o god where
[24:08] you are just speaking lord lip to ear to
[24:11] our hearts and our lives oh god our

[24:50] amen
[24:53] hallelujah
[24:55] amen we could just sing that on and on
[24:58] amen i love that song that's just such a
[25:00] precious song you you find yourself
[25:03] singing
[25:04] amen those songs like that in many
[25:06] different times when
[25:07] you know i think how the song we
[25:10] i don't know when we sing that song take
[25:12] the name of jesus with you did i have
[25:13] you sing it on sunday sunday my lord
[25:17] but it's true
[25:18] it's true you know there's so many
[25:20] things sometimes when when as the bible
[25:23] said when snares and temptations around
[25:25] you
[25:25] gather
[25:27] breathe that holy name in prayer
[25:29] you know there's times when it's when
[25:31] it's easy there's times when it's easy
[25:33] to
[25:34] to pray or there's times it's easy to
[25:36] praise but it's in those times when it's
[25:38] difficult times that
[25:41] when you just can press through and just
[25:42] say lord
[25:43] i need thee
[25:45] oh
[25:46] i need thee
[25:48] but samuel do you do that yeah i do that
[25:50] because this is this is a constant it's
[25:52] a constant time i need thee
[25:55] but say it must be when you fell on the
[25:56] mountain no no in the times of the
[25:58] valley lord i need thee
[26:01] and then in the times when it seems like
[26:03] that everything you know everything's
[26:04] being pointed out but i can say lord
[26:07] you're
[26:08] good you're faithful lord
[26:11] you're faithful in everything
[26:14] amen
[26:15] oh glory be to god let's just look into
[26:17] the word of the lord tonight in psalms
[26:19] 23 i'm going to start there
[26:22] i want to just move right on into this
[26:24] tonight
[26:26] and uh ask you just to be in prayer
[26:29] for us lord willing
[26:32] my
[26:33] mom and i are going to be
[26:35] traveling together i'm going to drop her
[26:36] off in west virginia and then i've got
[26:38] to keep going to north carolina i've got
[26:40] meetings there this weekend
[26:42] and so i just ask that you just just
[26:44] keep us in prayer god will just
[26:46] strengthen us
[26:48] and guide us for those services there
[26:51] and um
[26:53] also brother boaz romero it's been a
[26:55] while since brother boaz has been here
[26:57] but brother boaz is going to come and
[26:59] take the service
[27:01] i hear the lord willing on sunday
[27:04] so you just be in prayer for that and
[27:06] amen we'll just
[27:08] want to turn our attention here to the
[27:10] to the word of the lord we've been
[27:12] reading out of psalms 23 and i've got a
[27:15] just as a
[27:16] a thought out of here it's still dealing
[27:18] with what we were working with but i
[27:20] want to just really move right into that
[27:22] tonight and hopefully we can get to it
[27:24] we'll see how far we get with this
[27:26] but i'd like to speak on the peace of
[27:28] god
[27:29] the peace of god
[27:31] psalms 23 verse 1. a psalm of david the
[27:35] lord is my shepherd
[27:37] i shall not want
[27:39] he maketh me to lie down in green
[27:42] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[27:45] waters
[27:47] he restoreth my soul
[27:49] he leadeth me in the paths of
[27:51] righteousness for his name's sake
[27:54] and yea though i walk through the valley
[27:56] of the shadow of death i will fear no
[27:58] evil for thou art with me
[28:00] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[28:05] thou preparest a table before me
[28:08] in the presence of mine enemies and thou
[28:11] anoint us my head with oil
[28:13] and my cup runneth over surely goodness
[28:17] and mercy
[28:18] shall follow me all the days of my life
[28:22] and i will dwell in the house of the
[28:25] lord forever
[28:26] amen may god bless you and bless the
[28:28] reading of the word as you're being
[28:29] seated
[28:30] i'd like to draw your attention here
[28:32] into verse four and we've been looking
[28:34] at this in the home and i just would ask
[28:36] you just to invite the holy spirit to
[28:39] say lord
[28:40] just bring this real personal to my
[28:42] heart and just allow god just to break
[28:45] it down because
[28:46] you know this as a believer
[28:48] that when the scripture says that this
[28:50] when the spirit of truth has come he
[28:52] will lead and guide us into all truth
[28:55] and there are things that you and i are
[28:57] aware of as believers at times when
[28:58] we've sat in a service
[29:00] or you're listening to a message you're
[29:02] reading out the scriptures and there are
[29:05] things that are spoken to your heart
[29:07] that are not even wrote there or that
[29:09] even you're not hearing in that message
[29:12] or
[29:13] you're not even hearing it by the voice
[29:15] of the individual that god is viewing
[29:17] using but yet you're hearing god speak
[29:20] to you
[29:21] and it's a way how god takes it you know
[29:23] just that way that god takes it to you
[29:26] is the same way that god will deal with
[29:28] a minister that sometimes there's things
[29:30] that you can hear and a thought just
[29:32] starts coming in it just starts building
[29:34] and god begins to press upon something
[29:37] that you're you begin to see something
[29:39] that how god just begins to press that
[29:41] and it now becomes a thought that god's
[29:44] wanting to convey in there
[29:45] and i know i believe that god when we're
[29:47] looking here in the scriptures we just
[29:49] invite him just to come and just speak
[29:51] to our hearts help me god to apply this
[29:54] in my own life and if there's something
[29:56] that needs to be said lord just guide
[29:58] brother samuel help him just to step out
[30:00] of the way that he can say things that
[30:02] needs to be said
[30:04] in verse 4 it says yea though i walk
[30:06] through the valley of the shadow of
[30:08] death i will fear no evil
[30:11] for thou art with me i want you to catch
[30:15] this in the scripture david never said
[30:18] that there wouldn't be conditions around
[30:20] that wouldn't try to cause fear
[30:23] but what he said is is that i will
[30:26] i will fear
[30:27] no evil
[30:30] so it's around but i won't fear it but
[30:33] here's where he's drawing his strength
[30:35] to cast out fear that wants to come
[30:39] for thou
[30:40] art with me amen
[30:43] so and so this is the way the scripture
[30:44] said perfect love it cast out all
[30:47] fear
[30:48] and you see when when we look here in
[30:51] the scripture evil as we see this in the
[30:53] scripture evil is present but there is a
[30:56] light that is present to light up the
[30:59] way that's what makes it a shadow
[31:01] because there is light present and david
[31:05] he takes drawing comfort as a believer
[31:07] that though there are times of darkness
[31:09] that come
[31:11] i will not fear the evil because you are
[31:15] with me
[31:16] and all throughout this building here
[31:18] tonight
[31:19] we've all been in situations and and
[31:22] places where fear has tried to encroach
[31:26] upon our life
[31:27] and i'm talking about even as a child of
[31:29] god
[31:30] sealed with the spirit of god
[31:32] there's things to how the enemy can even
[31:34] try to come into your mind and into your
[31:37] spirit and try to trouble you
[31:40] there's things sometimes that we begin
[31:41] to recognize that there's some things
[31:43] that we've got to tune out and tune in
[31:45] too
[31:47] there's things that you know that that
[31:48] within it that i i just share this with
[31:51] you as it comes to me my wife and i i
[31:53] told you about a time i preached at a
[31:55] church there in prescott i wasn't even
[31:57] supposed to preach there at the latter
[31:59] part of that of those meetings
[32:01] and i'd come down and i was getting on
[32:02] my way to the airport and we ended up
[32:04] ministering there that night i told you
[32:06] it was so important i had no no dress
[32:08] clothes to even preacher then i preached
[32:10] in crocs and jeans and everything else
[32:12] now what i didn't what i wasn't aware of
[32:15] when we went into that church that night
[32:18] i didn't put two and two together that
[32:20] some of the prayer requests that had
[32:21] been offered up for even people that
[32:23] were dealing with covet and things like
[32:25] that was right there
[32:27] i think god because all of a sudden then
[32:30] when i begin to put some two and two
[32:32] together and you know the enemy's always
[32:33] there to give you two and two
[32:35] are you hearing me because let me just
[32:37] pause and say this we understand i don't
[32:40] even like to give it space to even deal
[32:42] with it but we understand it's real but
[32:44] it's not our master
[32:46] is that right we never let flu master us
[32:49] never let sinus never let nothing it's
[32:51] real we don't we we understand we're not
[32:53] foolish where people say oh that stuff
[32:56] ain't real we're not fools we are
[32:58] believers
[32:59] are you with me so we recognize within
[33:02] these within these things i'm just
[33:04] sharing something very personal with you
[33:06] that after we got out of that service
[33:07] that that night and begin to realize you
[33:10] know when and you start you know you
[33:12] start hearing things you're hearing
[33:13] certain people you know you're coughing
[33:14] and everything else going on and you're
[33:16] hearing different things you know we get
[33:18] back into the place you know the family
[33:20] that we are staying with and that night
[33:22] you know we didn't get very much sleep
[33:24] at all maybe about i don't know even if
[33:27] we did get sleep at all that night
[33:29] because we had to get up at 1 30 and go
[33:30] to the airport and turn the car in so
[33:33] we're laying there and i'm telling you
[33:35] that satan wanted to come and try to
[33:38] bring fear now i didn't say nothing to
[33:40] my wife but how the enemy was battling
[33:43] her that whole night she didn't get a
[33:44] moment's worth of sleep either and satan
[33:47] has come in there trying to battle
[33:49] within the mind look where you're at now
[33:51] and look where this and look where that
[33:53] i'm just exposing that devil
[33:56] and you see the thing that he was
[33:58] wanting to try to do was to try to bring
[34:01] fear
[34:02] you say brother samuel what did you do i
[34:04] looked to the lord and i began to just
[34:06] pray as i laid there on the bed i began
[34:09] to pray for my wife she was she was
[34:11] there sometimes in and out you know the
[34:13] restroom there are those couple of hours
[34:15] and we just begin to pray now i didn't
[34:18] know until the next morning here we are
[34:20] 1 30 in the morning on our way and then
[34:22] she's sitting in the car beside me and
[34:24] she starts testifying because when the
[34:27] enemy was trying to come at her she
[34:29] starts testifying about reading messages
[34:32] while she was there in the bathroom and
[34:34] back and forth looking up things that
[34:36] the prophet of god had said regarding
[34:39] things where fear and anxiety and things
[34:41] would want to try to come i tell you
[34:43] there's a way to meet the devil
[34:45] there is a place that you and i have
[34:48] we're not naive to say well no this
[34:50] ain't going to come around me as a
[34:51] believer no it'll come try to come
[34:53] around but this is where we've got to
[34:55] draw our strength from i will fear no
[34:59] evil
[35:00] i mean what's to fear when there's no
[35:02] evil around but david said thou art with
[35:05] me and that's where i'll draw my
[35:07] strength from i'll tell you what as i
[35:09] began to lay there and i began to pray
[35:11] and i said god i know you're the one
[35:13] that led me here i didn't even plan on
[35:15] this lord matter of fact when i went to
[35:17] went there to the finally went to church
[35:19] that night i wasn't planning on
[35:21] preaching i was planning on hearing that
[35:23] pastor i wanted to hear him preach you
[35:25] know i wasn't planning on that but i
[35:27] said lord you sent me here and you're
[35:30] the one to keep me you're the one to
[35:32] watch over she said what was it you were
[35:34] looking at it's trusting in the lord i
[35:36] didn't know everything and how things
[35:38] would come out but i knew god was in
[35:41] control
[35:42] are you hearing me you see there's times
[35:44] where sometimes as you're poking holes
[35:47] and it all of a sudden just doesn't go
[35:48] away what do you have to do continue to
[35:51] poke holes and what did you do i turned
[35:54] my attention by the grace of god to the
[35:56] lord i begin to worship i begin to thank
[35:59] god begin to thank him for his mercy and
[36:02] knowing in his keeping power and the
[36:04] same time that's where my wife was at
[36:06] and i'll tell you what we had a spell on
[36:08] our way back to the airport you talking
[36:10] about a time of fellowship
[36:12] she began to rehearse things she was
[36:14] reading i began to say things here we
[36:16] didn't know what was going on at that
[36:18] time but i could sense that spirit of
[36:21] anxiety and fear was wanting to come
[36:24] around but thanks be to god for the
[36:27] unspeakable gift of god to propose in
[36:31] that devil
[36:34] that's just a personal testimony
[36:37] and every one of us have been in round
[36:39] situations like that situations that
[36:42] come up you say brother samuel what is
[36:44] it that fear i think how brother ernie
[36:46] uh villanueva right or wrong he he you
[36:49] know brother ernie could come up with
[36:50] some acronyms he came up with fear i
[36:52] think i shared this with some of you
[36:53] brothers fear false evidence appearing
[36:57] real
[36:59] that's all right in it that'd be good
[37:01] for the refrigerator that'd be good for
[37:02] the mirror that'd be good for us to post
[37:05] all around
[37:07] you see when we look at it here
[37:10] because the children of god are not to
[37:12] be controlled by fear
[37:15] we're not to be controlled by fear in
[37:17] psalms 27 verse 1 that when we look at
[37:20] this david would say the lord is my
[37:22] light and my salvation whom shall i fear
[37:27] not what
[37:28] whom
[37:30] the lord is the strength of my life of
[37:33] whom shall i be afraid
[37:36] now this is here is a ruddy
[37:40] little
[37:41] man that's speaking these things
[37:44] so it's not the physical stature that he
[37:46] matches up but he's recognizing like
[37:49] paul could write in ephesians 6 that the
[37:52] light what gives him strength what does
[37:54] light do it exposes and pushes back
[37:57] darkness
[37:58] what does light do in our life it pushes
[38:00] back darkness this this is why the
[38:03] prophet would read this text for the
[38:06] rapture message because in the hour that
[38:09] we're living in darkness is so thick the
[38:11] bible said in the time of egypt it was a
[38:14] darkness that could be felt the bible
[38:16] tells us it's a gross darkness that gets
[38:18] upon the people where people will
[38:20] believe lies and spirits have so
[38:23] overtaken people's lives that they can't
[38:25] recognize truth they can't discern right
[38:28] from wrong where this is at it's a gross
[38:30] darkness the bible says in isaiah that's
[38:33] upon the people and if not for god's
[38:35] grace remember we were sometimes
[38:38] darkness not just in it we were darkness
[38:41] but now what made the difference god
[38:44] came on the scene now are ye light in
[38:47] the lord and what does that light do in
[38:50] your life it's not a man-made light this
[38:52] is not starlight this is not candlelight
[38:55] this is shekinah light that's what the
[38:58] holy ghost is and if you rest within the
[39:00] shekinah light of god and rest within
[39:03] that word it'll push out fear when it
[39:05] wants to encroach
[39:08] i don't care who you are i don't care
[39:10] how long you've been around you got to
[39:11] be real
[39:14] you don't fool nobody you ain't fooling
[39:16] god if you got to be real and that's the
[39:18] way god will come on the scene be honest
[39:20] with him if there was something i was
[39:22] fearful about i'd be honest with him
[39:24] because he already knows
[39:26] and i'd say lord give me strength lord
[39:30] is that right
[39:32] i mean different ones of you you know as
[39:33] you've been through times of surgery and
[39:35] things like that i've had things there
[39:37] in the home and things sometimes that
[39:39] you have to deal with and you know
[39:40] everything that you're going through you
[39:43] have the things that can be all all
[39:45] around
[39:46] but to think how david would liken it
[39:48] that it's light that he receives
[39:51] strength to cast out that fear it's the
[39:53] strength of the lord in his life that
[39:56] allows him to say of whom shall i be
[39:59] afraid
[40:00] now he said when the wicked even mine
[40:02] enemies
[40:03] my foes came upon me to eat my flesh
[40:06] they stumbled and
[40:08] fell though a host should encamp against
[40:12] me
[40:13] my heart shall not fear you catch what
[40:15] he's saying my heart shall not fear
[40:19] the war should arise against me in this
[40:24] will i be confident
[40:26] what are you going to be confident in
[40:28] not in what i see around me
[40:30] i'm going to be confident in the lord is
[40:33] the light of my life
[40:35] the lord is the strength of my life
[40:38] that's where i'm gonna draw my source of
[40:42] strength and comfort from is the things
[40:45] of almighty god
[40:48] and notice how david would speak of
[40:50] desiring to be in the air and he said
[40:53] i've desired of the lord that i will
[40:54] seek after that i may dwell in the house
[40:56] of the lord all the days of my life to
[40:59] behold the beauty of the lord and to
[41:00] inquire in his temple for in the time of
[41:03] trouble i want you to catch this in the
[41:05] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[41:09] pavilion
[41:10] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[41:14] hide me
[41:16] this is dealing with the innermost
[41:18] chamber the secret place it's dealing
[41:20] with god coming to reside there in the
[41:23] soul taking us where our lives are
[41:26] hidden in god through christ he will
[41:29] take me in the time of trouble in his
[41:31] pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle
[41:34] shall we hide me he shall set me upon a
[41:37] rock this ain't nothing that we do it's
[41:39] what he does
[41:41] when does he do that in the time of
[41:43] adversity in the time of trouble you see
[41:45] his closeness this is what i want you to
[41:47] catch from this even as we looked at the
[41:49] husbands and so forth his closeness his
[41:52] presence he does not distance himself
[41:55] from us but rather in times of heartache
[41:57] he draws near
[41:59] and he takes us deeper
[42:03] he takes us
[42:04] deeper
[42:06] is that right
[42:07] you see this is why in isaiah 43 1
[42:12] how the lord would write
[42:15] and say but now thus saith the lord that
[42:17] created thee o jacob and he that formed
[42:20] thee o israel
[42:21] fear not
[42:22] for i have redeemed thee i have called
[42:25] thee by name thou art mine
[42:30] this understanding alone is enough to
[42:32] cast out fear
[42:35] that i didn't seek god god sought me
[42:39] i you know you and i could have lost
[42:41] lost sight of god but god never lost
[42:43] sight of me
[42:45] it wasn't me that was looking for god
[42:47] god came looking for me
[42:49] it wasn't i that you know god wasn't
[42:51] lost and i found him i was lost and he
[42:55] came and found me
[42:57] [Applause]
[42:59] is that right and this is where then
[43:02] fear not
[43:04] fear not based on that reality that this
[43:07] is god's working
[43:10] let me just say it as it comes to me
[43:12] this is why brother branham tells us
[43:15] in marriage and divorce
[43:17] and he speaks of that scripture
[43:19] whatsoever god hath joined together let
[43:22] no man put asunder
[43:24] and brother brahman says that revelation
[43:26] he says when that revelation that this
[43:28] is your spouse that's yours the rest of
[43:31] your life
[43:33] is that right
[43:35] it's it's an anchor it's an absolute it
[43:38] passes all understanding it's an anchor
[43:41] it's something you come back to just
[43:43] like in your life hey come on am i
[43:45] preaching now it's just like in our life
[43:47] when we're dealing with tests and we're
[43:49] dealing with trials how do you make it
[43:51] through the test and trial you draw from
[43:53] that experience on the sacred sides of
[43:56] god's grace you draw strength from there
[43:59] when it seems like all chaos and
[44:01] everything is around you you've got a
[44:03] source of strength a hidden light where
[44:06] you can draw strength and in your life
[44:09] you're able to stand there even when you
[44:11] don't know what's going on you don't
[44:12] know how things are going to turn out
[44:14] but you're standing there not by your
[44:15] own strength you're standing there by
[44:17] the strength of the shady eye
[44:22] fear not
[44:24] verse 2
[44:25] oh my when
[44:28] thou passer through the waters notice
[44:30] not if
[44:31] when
[44:34] no wonder in the vows for better for
[44:35] worse
[44:39] these ain't disney world vows
[44:41] hello somebody
[44:43] they live happily ever after
[44:46] they never ever had any argument or as
[44:48] brother john lafontaine said he did
[44:50] fellowship
[44:54] but you see
[44:56] what brings happiness
[44:58] what brings joy
[44:59] it depends on the resource you draw from
[45:02] the things of this world is temporal are
[45:05] you hearing me if you try to live on the
[45:07] things of this world and bring that into
[45:09] your marriage it's temporal you you are
[45:12] meant and built to live and there's one
[45:14] place that you can actually be satisfied
[45:17] and that's not that's in the lord the
[45:19] lord is my shepherd and i shall not want
[45:22] it's there's no way let me just say this
[45:24] to you there's no way i can meet the
[45:25] need and everyone and for my little
[45:27] darling sitting right there there's no
[45:29] way she can meet the need for me of
[45:31] everything she's a great help she's a
[45:33] great comfort but you see
[45:35] that relationship that i have with the
[45:37] lord by the grace of god that's where i
[45:40] draw strength that when adversity comes
[45:42] up that when misunderstandings arise
[45:45] that when situations come that though
[45:47] she can stand there and comfort me with
[45:49] the word of the lord but i've got to
[45:51] have that comforter myself i've got to
[45:53] have that experience that i'm drawing
[45:56] strength from
[45:57] in the lord
[46:00] is that all right
[46:02] because she's not my personal walk with
[46:03] jesus
[46:05] neither am i her personal walk with
[46:06] jesus
[46:09] amen i might be her husband or pastor
[46:11] and everything but i'm not her personal
[46:13] walk with jesus she has to have her own
[46:15] personal walk i'm not her victory she
[46:18] has to have victory in jesus
[46:21] are you with me but it sure helps when i
[46:22] have victory
[46:24] [Music]
[46:26] oh let's finish this scripture when thou
[46:29] passeth through the waters
[46:31] i will be with thee
[46:33] lord you mean you just can't make the
[46:34] waters go away lord i'd like the waters
[46:36] parted
[46:37] god's letting them know i parted them
[46:39] before i'm part of them again but you
[46:42] have to walk through them
[46:45] through the rivers they shall not
[46:47] overflow thee
[46:49] all right
[46:50] look can we just go around them no
[46:53] but i'm telling you they will not
[46:55] overflow you
[46:58] when thou walk us through the fire
[47:01] wonder if them hebrew boys was
[47:03] fellowshipping on this one
[47:05] hallelujah
[47:07] when thou walkest through the fire thou
[47:09] shalt not be burned
[47:12] neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
[47:15] did it happen or not
[47:17] it happened everyone on the red sea the
[47:20] jordan there when they stood in the
[47:22] fiery furnace it shows that there's
[47:25] nothing that can overtake a believer
[47:30] oh my tester trial that god allows to
[47:34] come away but he said he is faithful
[47:37] to see us through he's right there with
[47:39] us and this is why here it would read in
[47:42] psalms 32 verse 1 behold a king
[47:45] shall reign in righteousness and princes
[47:47] shall rule in judgment and a man shall
[47:50] be as a hiding place notice a man shall
[47:53] be as a hiding place from the wind and a
[47:57] covert from the tempest as rivers of
[47:59] water in a dry place as the shadows of a
[48:03] great rock in a weary land
[48:06] see god makes this real it's like the
[48:08] little boy when his remember his mama
[48:11] told him brother brown tells his story
[48:12] in mighty gardenville before us and
[48:14] remember he that she's telling him
[48:16] junior and you know the storm is outside
[48:18] and you know junior we're christians and
[48:20] and you know we believe in the lord and
[48:22] and junior says your mommy i believe all
[48:25] that he said but in times like this
[48:27] i need a god with skin on it
[48:30] he was asking mommy to sleep by him that
[48:32] night
[48:34] you know what mommy would be the comfort
[48:36] for him that night it wasn't going to be
[48:38] the storm's getting taken away but if
[48:39] you come by me mommy
[48:42] then it don't matter what kind of
[48:43] thunder lightning and everything else
[48:45] comes around i've got a comfort that i
[48:47] can go to sleep and sleep like a baby
[48:51] oh if we would just invite jesus
[48:55] come on friends instead of trying to
[48:58] make and figure out our own problems and
[49:00] put them together you only make a bigger
[49:02] mess out of it what should i do invite
[49:05] jesus
[49:08] where do i invite him invite him to put
[49:09] this skin on
[49:13] lord you can use this skin you can use
[49:16] this vessel you can use this veil lord
[49:19] god
[49:22] oh my
[49:24] you see sometimes we're so interested
[49:26] that we're the one that well i've got to
[49:28] attend the garden but remember adam
[49:30] tended the garden under the leadership
[49:32] and the direction of god
[49:35] this was not his own doing his own
[49:37] choosing his own his own will doing that
[49:40] it was surrendered under the headship of
[49:42] god
[49:43] so as adam was walking under the
[49:45] headship of god then it would have an
[49:46] effect there even within his home and
[49:49] within there of the surroundings notice
[49:52] a man shall be as a hiding place from
[49:54] the wind a covert from the tempest as
[49:56] rivers of water in a dry place as the
[49:58] shadow of a great rock in a dreary
[50:01] land
[50:02] and david goes on to say in psalms 23 4
[50:05] thy rod and thy staff
[50:08] they comfort me
[50:10] see
[50:11] the guidance
[50:13] that comes along the way
[50:15] and there's also you know how it is with
[50:17] that shepherd's
[50:18] the hook or crook or whatever they call
[50:20] it that that little part that bends
[50:22] around
[50:23] is to reach out
[50:25] and sometimes when that lamb is looking
[50:27] the wrong way
[50:28] going the wrong way it has to reach
[50:30] right out around that and bring it back
[50:32] into the right way
[50:35] because sometimes we get to wondering
[50:37] about things or looking at things and
[50:40] sometimes the the longevity of time
[50:44] sometimes the longevity of things we're
[50:46] praying about
[50:50] let me say this abraham waited 25 years
[50:55] brother branham waited to the change of
[50:56] his body
[50:59] the healing of his stomach are you
[51:00] willing are you with me
[51:02] he kept preaching he kept pressing he
[51:03] kept pressing and kept looking to the
[51:06] lord is that right paul remember paul
[51:09] with his eyes he even said i besought
[51:12] the lord thrice take it away and god
[51:14] said my grace is sufficient you know
[51:16] paul said i'm going to quit asking for
[51:19] and looking looking in a manner that
[51:21] this is going to be completely healed
[51:23] i'm going to pray for healing and god
[51:25] healed him and then after time he would
[51:27] come back but in the midst of that time
[51:30] listen to me now
[51:31] in the midst of that time it was paul's
[51:34] attitude that invited the presence of
[51:36] god
[51:38] it's not just a given that when we're
[51:40] weak we're strong
[51:42] he said i will glory in my infirmities
[51:45] that the power of christ and that phrase
[51:48] means the tent of his dwelling
[51:50] hallelujah might rest upon my life
[51:54] that the shekinah in the midst but this
[51:56] happened you don't know sometimes how
[51:57] hard things are i think we all do and
[51:59] that that's one of the greatest tricks
[52:01] of the devil is to so isolated says oh
[52:03] nobody knows how you suffer nobody knows
[52:06] what you go through and nobody but jesus
[52:08] knows
[52:10] we may not have been through the exact
[52:11] same situation or the same thing but we
[52:14] all have tests and trials we all have
[52:16] pathways that we come through it doesn't
[52:18] help and maybe you could look at
[52:20] somebody else and say they ain't never
[52:22] been where i've been but he knows all
[52:23] about it
[52:26] and in reality he's not been in every
[52:28] path but he's conquered every gate
[52:30] because every temptation will come
[52:32] through one of three gates i
[52:35] flesh
[52:37] is that right
[52:39] thus pride of life all those things but
[52:42] he conquered the gates of the united
[52:44] states
[52:45] he conquered every gate
[52:47] because you see even as a sister sister
[52:49] could not say well jesus understands me
[52:51] jesus does not understand in that
[52:53] capacity but he understands as our high
[52:56] priest of what we go through of what it
[52:58] would feel like and we could come to him
[53:01] and he understands us he doesn't he just
[53:03] moves on our behalf he senses our
[53:06] weakness
[53:10] thyroid and by staff they comfort me no
[53:13] matter how long it is
[53:16] that comforts me
[53:19] oh my
[53:21] through that through that whole dark
[53:23] veil
[53:24] as paul would write in hebrews 13 5
[53:27] let not your conversation be let your
[53:30] conversation be without covenant and be
[53:32] content with such things as you have for
[53:35] he hath said i will never leave thee
[53:39] nor forsake thee
[53:41] and so that we might boldly say the lord
[53:44] is my helper
[53:46] my secure one who comes to my aid one
[53:49] who comes to minister to me
[53:53] and i will
[53:54] not fear
[53:57] what man
[53:59] shall do unto me
[54:01] notice psalms 23 5 thou preparest a
[54:05] table before me in the presence of mine
[54:06] enemies thou
[54:08] anointest my head with oil and my cup
[54:13] runneth over
[54:14] and when you look at every one of these
[54:16] places here in psalms 23
[54:19] even in this scripture right here the
[54:21] enemy's not removed as far as well
[54:23] there's no enemy there's no evil around
[54:25] but quite the contrary david's aware are
[54:29] you with me he's aware of the evil he's
[54:32] aware of the enemy but his focus is not
[54:36] on the enemy or the evil his focus is is
[54:40] thou has prepared a table
[54:45] for me amen in the very presence
[54:49] of mine
[54:50] enemy thou anointest
[54:53] my head with oil
[54:56] you know when they anoint them with oil
[54:58] it's to keep all the parasites and the
[55:00] bugs and things like that i'm going to
[55:02] say god i need my head anointed to keep
[55:04] out all them lying thoughts and those
[55:06] things that want to try to come in i
[55:08] need my head anointed with oil
[55:11] oh brother samuel i've got the anointing
[55:13] oil in my soul thank god for that but we
[55:15] need also the anointing of the holy
[55:18] spirit even in our minds
[55:22] that's our responsibility to keep that
[55:24] in our lives like we've been looking at
[55:26] that in the courts
[55:28] is that right
[55:29] sometimes people wonder why they don't
[55:31] have peace what kind of things are you
[55:33] listening to what are you reading
[55:36] amen we've got to filter in this hour
[55:40] oh brother samuel you're saying i should
[55:42] be i need i'm saying you should be wise
[55:45] if there's things that's troubling you
[55:47] and bringing fear into your life and i
[55:50] say that you've got authority as a son
[55:53] and daughter of god to say you're not
[55:55] coming in here
[56:00] to be able to stand there at the door
[56:02] and say you're not coming in this home
[56:07] many times before things ever get in the
[56:08] home they've already got here in the
[56:11] mind
[56:16] notice this is where a strength that
[56:18] think of how that the bride in the song
[56:20] of solomon she can draw strength
[56:23] of knowing when she said i i can set
[56:26] under the shadow under his protection
[56:28] under his headship under his leadership
[56:30] with great delight what brings a comfort
[56:33] what brings a comfort what brings a
[56:34] comfort to you and i
[56:36] in coming here to this church
[56:38] and coming into a service
[56:39] oh is it the music
[56:41] that'll
[56:42] fade right oh it's the way you know
[56:46] things this is preacher that that'll
[56:48] fade right
[56:50] what is it that's to be the comfort and
[56:53] the strength of our life
[56:55] is the holy ghost
[56:58] the word of god you see the word it's
[57:02] not a letter it can be a letter but when
[57:04] the spirit of god comes upon that word
[57:07] as he has in this hour it's no longer
[57:10] letter it's energizing it's pulsating
[57:13] it's releasing strength to our life to
[57:16] discern
[57:17] present situations
[57:20] by an unfailing and unchanging god
[57:23] that lets himself lets himself be known
[57:25] i am with you
[57:30] this is where we draw strength psalm 1 1
[57:32] blessed is the man
[57:34] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[57:36] ungodly
[57:38] nor standeth in the way
[57:41] of sinners
[57:43] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[57:45] this is a blessed man
[57:49] because you see the seed of the scornful
[57:50] is a
[57:52] critic looking at everything and
[57:55] criticizing it let me tell you something
[57:57] you go to criticizing things eventually
[57:59] that critical spirit will turn right on
[58:01] your family
[58:03] you hold everybody else in such a light
[58:05] and this and that eventually it'll turn
[58:06] right on your family it will foster
[58:09] criticism
[58:11] are you hearing me
[58:13] this is why when brother van tells us
[58:14] those little them little boys or the
[58:16] little kitties when they spoke to elisha
[58:19] and said go on up old ball head brother
[58:21] brown said what it was they were
[58:22] speaking against was the message of
[58:25] elijah
[58:27] in the message respects he said they
[58:29] spoke against the message of elijah
[58:33] where did they learn that but the band
[58:35] tells us their homes
[58:39] their homes
[58:43] now no not one of us likes to be picked
[58:45] apart anybody like to be criticized
[58:48] good i don't want to pray a line spirit
[58:49] off nobody
[58:50] nobody likes to be criticized you know
[58:52] they get this term you know they would
[58:53] throw it around we taught and some of
[58:55] you experienced in your job constructive
[58:57] criticism
[58:58] oh yeah i believe in constructive
[59:00] criticism
[59:01] but there ain't not none of us none of
[59:03] us including me right here loves
[59:05] criticism
[59:08] sometimes we we need it
[59:10] right
[59:11] sometimes we need it
[59:13] but not not we do not invite that
[59:16] neither do we want to make that a part
[59:18] of our home because within that right
[59:21] there it does not invite the presence of
[59:23] the lord there is no table prepared in
[59:26] the presence of the enemy
[59:29] there is no anointing of the head
[59:32] cups are not running over
[59:36] but rather look at this look at this
[59:38] this is important his delight
[59:42] is in
[59:43] the cleveland browns
[59:46] nope don't say that
[59:48] his delight
[59:50] is in espn
[59:54] his delight
[59:56] is in
[59:58] the law
[59:59] of the lord
[1:00:01] if the delight is in anything else it's
[1:00:04] wrong
[1:00:07] brother deals with this so clearly the
[1:00:09] love of god should be so prevailing in
[1:00:12] our hearts the holy ghost
[1:00:14] should be so prevailing in our hearts
[1:00:17] brother adam says when the church doors
[1:00:18] are open we can't wait to get in here
[1:00:21] and have fellowship
[1:00:23] with our brothers and sisters
[1:00:25] we don't only fellowship while the word
[1:00:27] is coming forth but we fellowship even
[1:00:29] as we have times afterwards to be able
[1:00:32] to you know stand and talk to one
[1:00:34] another we need that you say but samuel
[1:00:36] i don't need it well i do can you do it
[1:00:37] for me i need it right i need it how
[1:00:41] many else need it
[1:00:44] well but i'm okay with it but it's gonna
[1:00:46] be on my terms that selfishness
[1:00:49] what about when somebody else needs
[1:00:51] fellowship and encouragement
[1:00:55] it might just be extending a hand to
[1:00:57] encourage them along the way
[1:01:00] my my my i'm trying to get to the peace
[1:01:03] of god
[1:01:04] i don't know if we're going to get there
[1:01:05] tonight or not
[1:01:07] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:01:10] lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[1:01:13] in day and night you see what you feed
[1:01:15] on that's right you'll meditate on
[1:01:19] this was one of the secrets
[1:01:21] in the land in joshua 1-1
[1:01:24] but it's also one of the areas that the
[1:01:26] devil likes to trouble
[1:01:29] the devil likes to so fill
[1:01:31] our minds
[1:01:33] and get them occupied on so many things
[1:01:35] and sometimes listen to me now sometimes
[1:01:37] there's things that you have to get on
[1:01:39] you have to get on your mind sometimes
[1:01:42] there's things you have to read through
[1:01:43] like whether it's an insurance policy or
[1:01:45] whatever it is you don't understand what
[1:01:46] i'm saying there's things sometimes or
[1:01:48] whether you want to read it or not
[1:01:49] you've got to get out the magnifying
[1:01:51] glass and read it you've got to
[1:01:52] understand it
[1:01:54] is that right and really the frustrating
[1:01:56] part comes in and saying i don't want to
[1:01:57] take no time to do that but we realize
[1:01:59] we must govern the affairs of this life
[1:02:02] lest they govern us
[1:02:06] our whole objective as a believer is to
[1:02:09] see to it that our lives do not become
[1:02:12] governed by things of this world that
[1:02:14] we've allowed to go by and then blaming
[1:02:16] on an attack of the devil instead of us
[1:02:19] taking initiative
[1:02:21] hello
[1:02:23] sometimes the devil's getting blamed for
[1:02:24] everything he said where in the world is
[1:02:25] that coming from i didn't mean that that
[1:02:26] wasn't even my fault that was just their
[1:02:28] negligence
[1:02:29] well i tell you the devil let that
[1:02:31] plumbing come loose in my house and yet
[1:02:33] you know you had a drip
[1:02:37] well the devil did this and the devil
[1:02:39] did that and the devil said lord have
[1:02:40] mercy i'm getting blood i'm getting all
[1:02:42] kinds of credit for things i didn't even
[1:02:43] do that was their negligence they knew
[1:02:45] that drip hello somebody
[1:02:48] you see there's things that we in our
[1:02:50] life is to occupy our life in a sense as
[1:02:53] a believer to say god there's no way
[1:02:55] that i can rely upon myself to try to
[1:02:57] catch everything but i can say lord help
[1:02:59] me to so order my steps that there are
[1:03:02] things when they arise that it does not
[1:03:04] come between you and me
[1:03:12] sometimes like i said there's things
[1:03:14] that come about in our life that we have
[1:03:15] to attend to there's things that
[1:03:17] sometimes we have to take time but
[1:03:18] there's seasons
[1:03:20] there's seasons
[1:03:23] seasons
[1:03:25] and notice what he shall be like he
[1:03:27] shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:03:29] rivers of water
[1:03:31] that bringeth forth his fruit
[1:03:33] in his season
[1:03:36] his leaf also shall not wither
[1:03:39] and whatsoever he doeth
[1:03:41] shall prosper that's the kind of man i
[1:03:44] want to be
[1:03:45] it's kind of man i want to be it's kind
[1:03:47] of christian that we all want to be
[1:03:49] that's the kind of man i want to be
[1:03:51] to where that the roots
[1:03:53] were planted planted meaning before
[1:03:56] the foundation of the world we were
[1:03:58] already planted in god
[1:04:00] but now the reality of the holy ghost
[1:04:03] has birthed us into the body of jesus
[1:04:06] christ and our roots
[1:04:08] are tapped into a source
[1:04:10] of life rivers of water we're drawing
[1:04:14] strength well where does that strength
[1:04:16] grow it moves up through our life
[1:04:19] fruit comes forth
[1:04:20] leaves
[1:04:22] what are leaves for healings of the
[1:04:23] nations
[1:04:24] what water leaves fellowship
[1:04:26] hello somebody leaves a green speak of
[1:04:29] life fellowship
[1:04:31] leaves can blow is that right how did
[1:04:33] david know to go and to attack the army
[1:04:36] and pursue his god said when thou hear
[1:04:39] the wrestling of the wind in the
[1:04:43] mulberry tree it wasn't good enough just
[1:04:46] to have branches it had to have leaves
[1:04:49] and it was the angels
[1:04:51] that blew those leaves
[1:04:54] i believe that's how our lives are to be
[1:04:56] sensitive as paul said let brotherly
[1:04:58] love continue
[1:05:00] for some have entertained angels
[1:05:04] lives that invite the angels to come
[1:05:06] live that invite ministering spirits to
[1:05:09] come
[1:05:10] amen and to minister and to help
[1:05:13] brother samuel do i have that kind of
[1:05:14] authority you do as a son of god
[1:05:17] you have authority we have authority i
[1:05:19] have authority to live life in that
[1:05:21] place that invites the presence of god
[1:05:27] see
[1:05:28] let's go now to verse six
[1:05:33] this scripture right here is where i
[1:05:34] want to
[1:05:36] draw from here just a few moments and
[1:05:38] i'm not even going to get anywhere close
[1:05:40] but we'll start into this here
[1:05:43] surely goodness
[1:05:45] and mercy
[1:05:46] shall follow me
[1:05:48] all the days of my life
[1:05:51] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:05:53] lord
[1:05:54] forever
[1:05:57] we not only need leadership leadership
[1:05:59] is
[1:06:00] going before us showing us the way
[1:06:02] not just somebody telling us the way but
[1:06:05] leadership is an expressed image
[1:06:09] is that right
[1:06:10] it was the evidence of life that brought
[1:06:12] leadership to the infidel as brother
[1:06:15] branham stood there
[1:06:17] life he saw the expression of god's life
[1:06:20] from that of nature tied into the
[1:06:22] healing of that woman and what was it it
[1:06:25] was life the presence of god that
[1:06:28] brought leadership
[1:06:30] for that situation
[1:06:32] so just you think how brother brandon
[1:06:34] stood there brother brown didn't go down
[1:06:37] are you listening to me
[1:06:39] brother brown didn't go down through
[1:06:40] chapters
[1:06:42] he didn't quote
[1:06:44] brother branham took something
[1:06:46] under the leading of god that that man
[1:06:48] knew about all right
[1:06:52] let me just tell you put that devil on
[1:06:53] the run that devil wants to tell you
[1:06:55] well you don't know a lot of scriptures
[1:06:56] you don't know a lot of quotes there's a
[1:06:58] lot of people can know a lot of
[1:06:59] scripture and know a lot of quotes but
[1:07:01] don't know the life
[1:07:03] i'm just going to preach
[1:07:04] it ain't about that because listen kids
[1:07:07] don't need a lecture
[1:07:10] come on now
[1:07:11] there's things that man didn't need a
[1:07:13] bible study he was already an infidel
[1:07:15] try to quote scripture to it you'd have
[1:07:16] never turned him around
[1:07:19] brother brahm didn't use quotes on him
[1:07:22] but he under the inspiration of god at
[1:07:24] that moment he had a heart for that man
[1:07:26] are you hearing me he had a heart for
[1:07:28] that man and god began to give him an
[1:07:31] example of something that was right
[1:07:33] there that god's life had been a witness
[1:07:37] season after season after season after
[1:07:40] season something he had walked by all of
[1:07:43] his life
[1:07:44] but that moment that apple tree was
[1:07:47] yielded in the hands of god that he
[1:07:50] could express the very god that would
[1:07:53] take that life down in the roots and
[1:07:55] raise it back up it became a place that
[1:07:58] the prophet can point to and say there
[1:08:00] is a god the same god that did it there
[1:08:03] is the same god that raised that woman
[1:08:05] up what was it it was the life of god
[1:08:08] giving leadership
[1:08:10] in that moment
[1:08:13] that's the seventh seal
[1:08:16] seven sealing out here in doctrine it's
[1:08:18] the coming of the lord the coming of the
[1:08:20] lord in the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:08:22] and it opens and makes the people ready
[1:08:25] for the corporal coming amen
[1:08:32] we not only need leadership
[1:08:35] remember god told it and told israel
[1:08:37] i'll go before you
[1:08:39] but then he also said when you
[1:08:41] read in the scripture how many of you
[1:08:42] read that read that word re-reward
[1:08:45] it read that in the scripture
[1:08:47] re-reward
[1:08:49] it means i've got your back
[1:08:53] i'll be right behind you
[1:08:55] so i want you to think about it god's
[1:08:57] before us and god's behind us
[1:09:01] what a place to be
[1:09:04] no place but the saying i'd rather be
[1:09:06] we could really sing that song no place
[1:09:08] brother brian i'd rather be him right
[1:09:11] behind right before us and also he's our
[1:09:14] re-reward he's the one bringing up the
[1:09:16] rear
[1:09:19] why would we need that because remember
[1:09:22] we need the goodness and the mercy of
[1:09:24] the lord because even at times as we're
[1:09:27] looking we fall
[1:09:29] short
[1:09:32] and we fail
[1:09:35] and in a home we're going to disappoint
[1:09:37] one another in a church we're going to
[1:09:40] disappoint one another
[1:09:42] preach with me now
[1:09:44] we're going to do that you know why
[1:09:46] because we're still humans
[1:09:50] sons and daughters of god but are still
[1:09:52] walking in fallen humanity our soul is
[1:09:56] in and not in a fallen condition when
[1:09:58] we've been born of the spirit of god we
[1:10:00] have the strength and the light of god
[1:10:03] on the inside
[1:10:07] praise the lord
[1:10:08] but sometimes where we have trouble is
[1:10:10] with one another's humanity
[1:10:13] and this is why we need the grace of god
[1:10:14] this is why god does not want a church
[1:10:16] that well i'm going to go to church
[1:10:18] where everybody agrees with me
[1:10:22] well maybe you're the reason they came
[1:10:23] up with clones
[1:10:25] maybe we just need to put a 3d printer
[1:10:26] in print and print a bunch of you out
[1:10:29] god don't want it that way you know why
[1:10:31] there's certain things about you that
[1:10:33] shows greenness in me there's certain
[1:10:35] things about me shows greenness in you
[1:10:37] that's right
[1:10:39] is that right
[1:10:40] well it's the truth
[1:10:42] so we need the goodness and mercy of god
[1:10:45] to follow us because we fall short many
[1:10:48] times
[1:10:49] this is where our scripture comes in
[1:10:51] that we've been looking at
[1:10:53] charity does not behave itself
[1:10:56] rudely
[1:10:58] now if you notice in that verse 5 it
[1:11:01] seeketh not her own
[1:11:06] not easily provoked
[1:11:08] thinketh no evil
[1:11:10] all of those things that are dealing
[1:11:12] with right here within charity all of
[1:11:13] this that's right here it deals with
[1:11:15] inwardly
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:19] now the love of god will never do this
[1:11:23] but the love of god will have to correct
[1:11:25] that feeling of love in that spirit
[1:11:27] realm
[1:11:28] are you hearing me
[1:11:31] you see behavior matters to god
[1:11:33] this is why in our life
[1:11:35] god
[1:11:36] will not keep
[1:11:38] offenses
[1:11:39] out of our heart
[1:11:40] the bible said again no place to the
[1:11:42] devil
[1:11:44] god won't keep those offenses out that's
[1:11:46] for you and i will be lord
[1:11:48] that's where you and i just say lord
[1:11:51] cleanse
[1:11:52] those offenses
[1:11:54] is that right
[1:11:56] see this is where it becomes our
[1:11:58] responsibility as a priest i mean we
[1:12:00] could just preach this right in on a
[1:12:01] sunday and deal with it because
[1:12:04] there is a lot of working that takes
[1:12:06] place and must there's a continuum
[1:12:08] within our life so we need
[1:12:10] the grace of god
[1:12:12] within every part of our life
[1:12:15] i won't ask you to raise your hands but
[1:12:16] how many times you said things
[1:12:18] that you need to repent
[1:12:20] and you had to repent whether it's to
[1:12:22] your spouse or whether it's somebody or
[1:12:24] maybe you were just talking and you said
[1:12:25] you know what
[1:12:26] forgive me i should have never said that
[1:12:28] i just was get i was a little frustrated
[1:12:32] or i mean however you want to you know
[1:12:33] smooth the frosting on and i blew up sex
[1:12:38] however you want to call you know
[1:12:41] i like how brother brown says it in a
[1:12:43] message of grace brother brown's talking
[1:12:45] about the family of god
[1:12:48] and brother brahms talking about how
[1:12:49] that
[1:12:50] when god provided for israel everything
[1:12:52] he provided a prophet
[1:12:54] a pillar of fire
[1:12:56] he provided
[1:12:57] of his word
[1:13:01] god did all that
[1:13:03] according to his promise
[1:13:05] and when god when here when the lord
[1:13:07] came down and began to deal with israel
[1:13:09] begin to bring them out
[1:13:12] you find israel get to a place
[1:13:14] they started complaining
[1:13:20] where's the water
[1:13:21] right
[1:13:24] where's the food
[1:13:26] all right
[1:13:27] you just brought us out here to die
[1:13:29] didn't you
[1:13:31] now all israel didn't do that
[1:13:34] right remember there was a mixed
[1:13:35] multitude
[1:13:36] that's right
[1:13:37] but i want you to remember remind you
[1:13:39] and this right here
[1:13:41] god spoke about this people they wearied
[1:13:44] him you know why because they were
[1:13:47] complaining
[1:13:49] let me just tell you something there's a
[1:13:51] lot of things that you and i could
[1:13:52] complain about i'm preaching now
[1:13:54] there's a lot of things we could
[1:13:55] complain about there's a lot of things
[1:13:57] about one another we could complain
[1:13:59] about
[1:14:02] come on now
[1:14:03] but let me remind you what brother adam
[1:14:04] tells us in united time and sign
[1:14:07] he talks about he realizes that as he
[1:14:09] gets older there are certain things that
[1:14:11] maybe is going to make him nervous
[1:14:13] and maybe get under his skin a little
[1:14:15] bit but brother barham asked god he said
[1:14:17] i have asked god he said because a lot
[1:14:20] of times when you get older you get
[1:14:22] cranky and crabby
[1:14:27] that's what he said
[1:14:29] now here's what brother branham said
[1:14:30] brother bram didn't say you know what
[1:14:32] but i got the holy ghost so i don't have
[1:14:33] to worry about that he didn't say that
[1:14:36] he said what i've asked god he said i do
[1:14:39] not want my life
[1:14:41] crowned
[1:14:42] with that kind of a spirit
[1:14:45] he said i've asked god to crown my life
[1:14:48] with the fruits of the spirit
[1:14:51] he said you take a life that's
[1:14:52] complaining he said and complaining
[1:14:54] constantly about this complaining
[1:14:56] constantly like that he said that
[1:14:58] weakens
[1:15:00] faith
[1:15:03] complaining
[1:15:04] weakens
[1:15:05] faith
[1:15:07] if that weakens faith
[1:15:09] think about what complaining can do
[1:15:12] within a home
[1:15:17] y'all gonna be glad i'm gone this
[1:15:18] weekend huh
[1:15:20] think about what it could do
[1:15:23] you continue picking at things and
[1:15:24] picking at things and picking at things
[1:15:26] and picking at things
[1:15:29] what does that do
[1:15:30] it weakens
[1:15:33] weakens whoo
[1:15:35] we're getting somewhere now
[1:15:38] the brown said just like a husband
[1:15:40] he said takes a wife he's tying this in
[1:15:42] like a husband take a wife
[1:15:45] he says if you'll be a good woman you
[1:15:47] take care of the house you'll be true to
[1:15:48] me if you'll clean my clothes we have
[1:15:50] children you'll be a mother to them if
[1:15:51] you'll do those things i'll work till my
[1:15:53] hands bleed to make you living if you'll
[1:15:54] do it but then think what if that woman
[1:15:56] turns wrong lives lazy and won't work
[1:15:58] and won't do nothing
[1:16:00] right here in this quote we could also
[1:16:01] add another line right now what happens
[1:16:02] if that man turns lazy
[1:16:06] come on now
[1:16:09] because we know we've got enough and
[1:16:10] listen it ain't been oh this is the way
[1:16:12] it is listen
[1:16:13] that's the influences that's been sown
[1:16:16] seeds all the way on down
[1:16:21] notice then it takes grace to keep that
[1:16:23] family together
[1:16:26] brother branson said oh god it's taken
[1:16:28] grace the grace of jehovah
[1:16:30] to keep his family together
[1:16:35] it's taken what grace
[1:16:37] brother brown talks about that when they
[1:16:38] came out and how they complained and
[1:16:40] this and that
[1:16:42] but notice what god did
[1:16:43] he fed him
[1:16:46] he took care of him he loved them
[1:16:49] he moved him around
[1:16:52] what did that because they deserved it
[1:16:54] no
[1:16:56] all right brother brown said his grace
[1:16:57] did that amen
[1:16:59] his grace did that
[1:17:01] the bible says that their shoes did not
[1:17:03] wear out neither did their clothes
[1:17:06] wear
[1:17:07] bear
[1:17:08] what did that
[1:17:10] god
[1:17:12] his grace took care of them even in
[1:17:16] their
[1:17:17] times
[1:17:22] that really was not real lovable was not
[1:17:24] real
[1:17:26] in regarding or deserving and grace is
[1:17:28] not about what we deserve
[1:17:30] because if we got what we deserve
[1:17:34] but his grace
[1:17:37] did it because of his promise
[1:17:39] and the grace went
[1:17:41] with the promise of god i want you to
[1:17:42] think of this let me let me close here
[1:17:45] on just
[1:17:47] i have just about five more minutes can
[1:17:49] i take that
[1:17:50] and i'm gonna close
[1:17:53] i'll let you know when to start your
[1:17:54] watch
[1:17:55] but i want you to think of this here
[1:17:59] brother braham takes the dedication in
[1:18:01] god hiding in simplicity and revealing
[1:18:03] himself in the same
[1:18:05] there in jeffersonville when they're
[1:18:06] dedicating the tabernacle
[1:18:08] and brother brahm says this is not the
[1:18:10] true tabernacle
[1:18:12] but he speaks
[1:18:14] and he identifies clear over there in
[1:18:16] the future home of where when that new
[1:18:18] city as it
[1:18:19] sets down here upon this earth
[1:18:24] brother brown goes through that of what
[1:18:25] day we're looking forward to
[1:18:28] but brother braham he makes a statement
[1:18:29] and he says
[1:18:31] but let us
[1:18:33] so
[1:18:34] characterize our lives
[1:18:37] that we would worship here as if we were
[1:18:40] all ready
[1:18:44] once you think of that potential you see
[1:18:46] what this message does
[1:18:48] it lets you know of the potentials
[1:18:51] that lay
[1:18:52] within
[1:18:55] how can that be possible because you
[1:18:57] have received the spirit
[1:19:00] of that land
[1:19:03] and by having the spirit of that land
[1:19:05] remember a house is not the people who
[1:19:07] live in it it's the order
[1:19:10] of the family that lives there is what's
[1:19:13] called a house
[1:19:15] that's a direct quote
[1:19:17] it's the order think about it the spirit
[1:19:19] of god
[1:19:20] as it said how what did the spirit when
[1:19:22] it said i saw the spirit of god
[1:19:24] descending from heaven
[1:19:26] as a bride
[1:19:28] adorned for her husband amen what is it
[1:19:31] showing is showing that the spirit of
[1:19:33] god coming down it's characterized in
[1:19:35] that
[1:19:36] of a bride who is adorned
[1:19:39] for her husband
[1:19:41] so it's reflected it's a life that is
[1:19:44] reflected the adornment the order of
[1:19:46] that land is what we live by amen that's
[1:19:50] the bible philippians chapter 3 for our
[1:19:52] conversation meaning our constitution
[1:19:56] is in heaven
[1:20:00] and i've got a representative over there
[1:20:03] i've been brought in contact by the
[1:20:05] baptism of the holy ghost my theophanies
[1:20:08] right there
[1:20:12] your theophany's right there
[1:20:14] who got representation before the throne
[1:20:16] of god
[1:20:18] and god says you never did it
[1:20:21] in the first place
[1:20:24] what are you involved i've been brought
[1:20:25] back to the first place
[1:20:30] so let us so characterize our lives as
[1:20:32] if we're
[1:20:33] already
[1:20:34] there
[1:20:35] on the other side
[1:20:37] let me read this here in closing
[1:20:38] colossians 3 12.
[1:20:41] put on therefore
[1:20:43] as the elect of god holy and beloved
[1:20:47] bowels of mercy
[1:20:49] kindness humbleness of mind meekness
[1:20:52] longsuffering
[1:20:54] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[1:20:57] another
[1:20:58] if any man have a quarrel against any
[1:21:01] even as christ forgave you
[1:21:04] so also do ye
[1:21:07] i may not be real smart but i know this
[1:21:10] if it tells me to forebear that shows me
[1:21:12] there's going to be times i've got to
[1:21:13] forebear
[1:21:15] and there's times i got to forgive then
[1:21:17] that tells me there's times i've got to
[1:21:18] forgive there's going to be times arise
[1:21:21] it tells me there's also going to be
[1:21:22] times that there's going to be times
[1:21:23] arise samuel you're not an angel you're
[1:21:25] going to have a quarrel
[1:21:29] but even as christ forgave you so also
[1:21:32] do
[1:21:33] you
[1:21:35] and above all things
[1:21:37] put on
[1:21:38] charity
[1:21:40] which is the bond of perfectness
[1:21:44] and let the peace of god
[1:21:47] rule
[1:21:48] in your hearts
[1:21:50] to the which also ye are called in one
[1:21:52] body
[1:21:54] and be ye thankful amen
[1:21:58] let it rule let it be
[1:22:00] the umpire
[1:22:03] what let the peace of god be the
[1:22:05] absolute
[1:22:06] let it be the umpire
[1:22:08] let it be that which
[1:22:10] it sorts things out and not to allow
[1:22:13] anything to disturb
[1:22:16] peace
[1:22:18] you see for the life of a believer let
[1:22:20] me just leave you with this
[1:22:22] for life of a believer
[1:22:25] that has experienced
[1:22:27] and has received the peace of god the
[1:22:30] dove of god
[1:22:32] in their soul
[1:22:33] your life
[1:22:35] is a peacemaker
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:39] is
[1:22:41] the reality that you live from
[1:22:44] a person that likes turmoil
[1:22:47] likes to dig their heels in likes to do
[1:22:49] all this
[1:22:50] this is where they have to start to
[1:22:51] evaluate no matter how much knowledge
[1:22:53] they have of scriptures and everything
[1:22:55] else the bible said blessed are the
[1:22:58] peacemakers
[1:23:01] amen for they
[1:23:03] shall be called the children of god
[1:23:06] see the peace of god
[1:23:08] is something that comes
[1:23:10] to you
[1:23:11] and you and i experience and then our
[1:23:14] lives are filled with the peace of god
[1:23:16] and our lives are lived as believers to
[1:23:19] make
[1:23:20] peace
[1:23:22] making peace ain't compromise but
[1:23:24] neither is making peace stirring up
[1:23:25] trouble
[1:23:28] all right
[1:23:29] man i wish i had two more hours on this
[1:23:31] right now
[1:23:36] influence of another
[1:23:38] look what david said david said i placed
[1:23:41] the lord always before me how many
[1:23:42] remember that scripture i placed the
[1:23:44] lord always before me look what brother
[1:23:45] of them says
[1:23:46] that i shall not be moved moreover he
[1:23:48] said then when i do that
[1:23:51] my flesh shall rest in hope
[1:23:54] when i do what place the lord before me
[1:23:58] because i know he will not leave my soul
[1:24:00] in hell neither will he suffer his holy
[1:24:01] one to see corruption for the lord is
[1:24:03] always before me whenever wherever you
[1:24:06] go
[1:24:07] place god
[1:24:08] if a man gets angry and cusses you place
[1:24:11] god between you and him
[1:24:13] if a guy calls you a holy roller place
[1:24:15] god between you and him
[1:24:17] if the wife gets angry with you place
[1:24:20] god if the husband gets angry place god
[1:24:24] if the children aggravate you
[1:24:27] place god
[1:24:28] whatever you do place
[1:24:31] god
[1:24:32] papa mama gives you a little spanking
[1:24:34] and corrects you place god
[1:24:36] remember what god said about it bring up
[1:24:38] a child in the way it should go always
[1:24:39] remember
[1:24:41] place god
[1:24:42] put god before
[1:24:45] you
[1:24:46] and you'll have reverence for god
[1:24:49] and respects
[1:24:50] for him
[1:24:52] and you know what that translates to
[1:24:54] when you have respect for god and
[1:24:56] respect for him you'll have respect
[1:25:00] for everybody else
[1:25:03] place god
[1:25:06] what's been placed within our lives this
[1:25:09] this place and we just lord willing next
[1:25:11] thursday we'll get into it
[1:25:14] a little more
[1:25:15] the peace of god
[1:25:17] i believe
[1:25:19] i believe with all my heart that this
[1:25:22] it's god's desire
[1:25:24] that our lives
[1:25:25] it should be lives of peace
[1:25:27] yes our homes you know
[1:25:30] look there's times where we have to we
[1:25:32] have to fight the devil
[1:25:34] there's times we have to stand right
[1:25:36] there with the sword and and cutting
[1:25:38] down there's times we have to stand are
[1:25:39] you with me there's times we have to
[1:25:41] stand there and correct situations
[1:25:44] but it's not in our heart to love to
[1:25:46] correct situations
[1:25:49] if it's in your heart to love to tell
[1:25:51] people where they're wrong then
[1:25:52] something's wrong with your heart
[1:25:55] because the predominating part is the
[1:25:57] peace of god
[1:26:00] but see love will drive us to bring
[1:26:03] correction
[1:26:05] but
[1:26:06] when is received the bible says it
[1:26:09] yielded
[1:26:11] peaceable
[1:26:13] fruits
[1:26:14] right
[1:26:15] so the objective is is you want
[1:26:17] peaceable fruits
[1:26:19] so even in correction of children
[1:26:22] correction of things in the home
[1:26:24] it matters how things
[1:26:26] are corrected
[1:26:31] in order to yield
[1:26:33] peaceable
[1:26:35] fruits
[1:26:37] see this is the desire
[1:26:39] of our lives because once
[1:26:41] that peace of god
[1:26:43] has come to our life and there's there's
[1:26:45] been a peace
[1:26:46] that passes all understanding
[1:26:48] it's a peace between
[1:26:51] my god and i
[1:26:53] then the desire is is for peace
[1:26:55] because you see what happens when
[1:26:57] there's not peace
[1:26:59] the dove
[1:27:00] takes its flight
[1:27:04] but simon whose responsibility that's
[1:27:06] that's our responsibility
[1:27:08] when something arises place god
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:12] now i want to just i close here
[1:27:17] don't allow the enemy take what the
[1:27:19] things that's been said tonight and if
[1:27:20] you let me just tell you something
[1:27:22] as a believer as a son and daughter of
[1:27:25] god
[1:27:26] let me just say this to you you've got
[1:27:27] more authority in heaven than the angels
[1:27:36] so there's no circumstance
[1:27:38] there's no situation the devil wants to
[1:27:40] bring whispers and things that would try
[1:27:42] to trouble and bring fear and oh i gotta
[1:27:44] do this and all i got
[1:27:46] a believer is not to work by anxiousness
[1:27:53] it's to be moved with the peace of
[1:27:58] god you've got authority to stand
[1:28:02] in every situation you've got authority
[1:28:04] to stand there
[1:28:06] but let the peace of god
[1:28:08] reign and be the umpire in your heart
[1:28:11] you know what i mean by that where the
[1:28:12] peace of god says
[1:28:14] that's a foul
[1:28:16] ball
[1:28:17] get that out of here
[1:28:19] you can't you can't use that attitude
[1:28:21] with this you can't
[1:28:22] see let the peace of god rule
[1:28:25] let him be the one who governs within
[1:28:28] within your life let him be the one
[1:28:29] that's there and no matter what
[1:28:31] situation arises
[1:28:34] as far as for our flesh it's more than a
[1:28:35] match for our flesh but it's not a more
[1:28:37] than a match for god
[1:28:39] over the same i believe that but maybe
[1:28:41] god wants to borrow you to prove that
[1:28:44] through
[1:28:46] and your situation in your life becomes
[1:28:48] the platform for god to step out on
[1:28:54] how many say lord
[1:28:57] you can use this platform
[1:29:00] you can use this platform lord
[1:29:02] let me be surrender let me be governed
[1:29:04] let my life be under the control
[1:29:06] of the peace of god let that be what i
[1:29:08] invite in my home let it be what i
[1:29:10] invite in my life
[1:29:13] let's pray
[1:29:15] heavenly father
[1:29:18] lord i
[1:29:19] want to say thank you for your mercy
[1:29:21] tonight
[1:29:23] would we be without you lord
[1:29:27] father i i don't know lord maybe
[1:29:29] lord sitting here tonight or maybe lord
[1:29:32] would hear this message or stream it at
[1:29:34] a later time
[1:29:36] but god i pray if there's one
[1:29:38] that doesn't know
[1:29:40] the peace of god
[1:29:42] that has not come to that place lord of
[1:29:44] real rest in you
[1:29:46] i pray tonight lord
[1:29:49] may it not just be
[1:29:51] another
[1:29:52] moment
[1:29:54] that's taken for granted but may it be a
[1:29:56] time that
[1:29:58] they just reach out to you and invite
[1:30:00] you and say
[1:30:01] peace of god
[1:30:03] cover me
[1:30:04] peace of god
[1:30:06] come into my life lord
[1:30:10] father
[1:30:12] may you move lord i pray for needs
[1:30:16] right here tonight
[1:30:18] maybe hearts lord that are troubled with
[1:30:20] circumstances or situations or things
[1:30:23] that
[1:30:25] are around them
[1:30:27] things that lord that they're facing
[1:30:29] that they can't even describe or put
[1:30:31] into words
[1:30:33] feelings or god of gloominess
[1:30:36] seems like darkness is
[1:30:38] one wanting to encroach
[1:30:41] lord i pray in this moment
[1:30:44] i ask o god
[1:30:46] that piece of god that
[1:30:48] same
[1:30:50] god
[1:30:51] who's right there in the boat
[1:30:54] we awake jesus tonight
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:30:58] then lord jesus
[1:31:01] you would speak lord to that story
[1:31:05] that same jesus that lives within our
[1:31:07] heart that would
