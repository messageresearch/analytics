[43:55] amen amen amen amen did we get it worked
[44:05] out let's go to Job chapter
[44:17] 26 sometimes these wires that attach
[44:20] This Together goes out
[44:23] and don't let you know till you get up
[44:26] here
[44:28] I'm not one of those guys that like to I
[44:30] don't like to hold a microphone if I
[44:32] don't if I don't have to I'd rather not
[44:35] I always teasing them I say I get a
[44:36] different anointing on me when I hold
[44:41] it but uh I I
[44:44] just if we can if it'll work all right
[44:47] here then we'll do it this way but I
[44:48] want to read just a few verses of
[44:50] scripture here tonight as we would um
[44:53] look at this here in the scripture in
[44:56] job 26 6 verse 1 and remember um this is
[45:00] where that job we had went to job 27
[45:05] last week and then then picked up back
[45:07] in job 25 where job 25 is actually the
[45:11] last time that one of the comforters or
[45:14] with accusations would speak and then
[45:18] this is one of the uh times where job
[45:20] begins to speak and job speaks from here
[45:23] all the way to where elu would begin to
[45:25] speak so I want to pick this up this is
[45:29] something the Lord just began to press
[45:30] on my heart here on on Saturday and um
[45:34] let's just read job answering that and
[45:36] said answered and said how hast thou
[45:41] helped him that is without power that's
[45:45] a question now remember bildad is they
[45:48] they've continued to bring accusations
[45:52] and bildad has remember in in in job 25
[45:55] where we read he said how can a man be
[45:58] just before God and so we went through
[46:01] that last week and now here's job
[46:04] responding to him and saying how hast
[46:06] thou helped him that is without power
[46:09] how savest thou the arm that hath no
[46:13] strength how hast thou counseled him
[46:17] that hath no wisdom and how hast thou
[46:21] plentifully declared the thing as it is
[46:26] to whom hast thou uttered words and
[46:30] whose Spirit came from
[46:33] thee I'd like to speak if the Lord would
[46:36] help us tonight I'd like to speak on
[46:39] being a help to the
[46:43] body being a help to the body amen God
[46:46] bless you as you're being
[46:52] seated and if I could I want you to just
[46:56] just bear with me here tonight I just I
[46:58] feel like I have uh so much ahead of me
[47:01] and um and what I mean is is that not
[47:04] that I intend to keep you here long uh
[47:06] and you say you always say that but um
[47:10] you want to be want to I want to look at
[47:13] things within the season and time and
[47:15] what God has for this particular service
[47:18] and so I ask you just to just to pray
[47:21] and be in prayer with me on this here
[47:22] because there's so many things that
[47:24] where we uh in looking at this uh go
[47:27] ahead and switch it over Brianna if you
[47:29] don't mind on being a help to the body
[47:31] and I'd like you to think of this this
[47:34] question how are you helping the body
[47:39] that's a like a question just to just to
[47:41] ponder every one of these statements
[47:44] that we read now don't draw your toes up
[47:47] in your shoes and get on the defense
[47:49] that's that's not the whole purpose of
[47:50] this tonight but this is the thing that
[47:53] for us that you know we want the word to
[47:55] come and to examine our lives and and
[47:58] the reality of it is God as we see in
[48:01] the scriptures he's the vine we're the
[48:04] branches and he has no other hands but
[48:07] our hands he has no other feet but our
[48:11] feet and so when we consider that we
[48:14] know that uh brother brandham if I can
[48:16] just uh make mention of this here
[48:18] there's been a a quote that is so laid
[48:20] on my heart over the the past uh number
[48:24] actually the past time that we've been
[48:25] dealing with this in job and it so stood
[48:27] out to me what brother Bram said often
[48:29] times when he preaches Divine love there
[48:31] that particular message in
[48:33] Jeffersonville and he says so often he
[48:35] said we we pray for the sinner he said
[48:38] but that's not what God has ultimately
[48:41] called us to do he said God has called
[48:44] us to contact the sinner he said so many
[48:48] times we pray for him and yet so there's
[48:50] a there's an aspect to that right there
[48:52] of needs that we're praying for now
[48:55] sometimes that contact if we can look at
[48:57] it it isn't always that you know at that
[48:59] point of the contact to be able to set
[49:02] down and going through scriptures with
[49:04] them and telling them how wrong they are
[49:06] but you first got to be able to
[49:08] administer that of a care one for
[49:11] another and they be able to show someone
[49:13] that you care and those are things that
[49:15] when we look at it I know I'm speaking
[49:18] there of one who maybe is not walking in
[49:20] serving the lord right now but I believe
[49:22] that goes along with every part that we
[49:25] we would have here among us is that
[49:28] where the spirit of God would lead us in
[49:30] that place that there a care that would
[49:32] be shown and would be displayed in our
[49:35] lives and this is the questions that
[49:37] that job is asking these these Brethren
[49:40] and I want you to remember what what the
[49:42] scripture calls them job even refers to
[49:44] them as comforters that's how they came
[49:47] they came to be a comfort they they did
[49:49] not come with the intent to tear job
[49:52] down if you can really we can really
[49:54] understand it we we speak of it in terms
[49:57] of what they were accusing him but I
[49:59] want you to remember that Satan himself
[50:02] had come before God and he had told him
[50:05] and said you let me let me get at him
[50:08] let me take the things that are around
[50:10] him and and all of those things he he
[50:13] touched not only job's children he
[50:16] touched job's livestock all everything
[50:19] that job had and he also touched those
[50:22] of his friends he even touched that of
[50:25] his wife where would discern and say
[50:28] when she said enough is enough just
[50:30] Curse God and die and job was able to
[50:33] discern by the spirit of Christ within
[50:36] him and said thou speakest like a
[50:39] foolish woman I want to I want to just
[50:41] say it this way is that discernment is
[50:44] not an option in our walk with God there
[50:47] is something that we should desire each
[50:49] and every time in our life God help me
[50:52] to have the discernment that's needed
[50:54] for this particular situation
[50:57] let me let me say it like this remember
[50:59] when when sister Rebecca when she ran
[51:01] out of the house and remember brother
[51:02] bham heard her playing those rock and
[51:04] roll Tunes at the neighbor down the
[51:06] street you've heard brother George uh
[51:08] give a little elaborate on that what we
[51:10] read in question answer 64 how brother
[51:13] Bram had just walked up to the door and
[51:15] he heard that you know that sister
[51:17] Rebecca was sitting there and here the
[51:19] other little one uh little girl was
[51:21] sitting there and they were playing
[51:22] those rock and roll Tunes brother Bram
[51:23] never calls a scene at the door then
[51:26] brother just said it's time to go and
[51:28] they got in the car and they went on and
[51:30] ate dinner and everything else now I I
[51:33] would say it like this there's no
[51:35] telling that brother Bram himself within
[51:37] his own Spirit was tore
[51:41] up that's his little daughter she's 18
[51:44] years old this is what I this is what I
[51:47] want to point to friends is that
[51:49] sometimes if we we we need to say God
[51:51] give me the right perception on how that
[51:53] even when I'm looking at the things that
[51:55] I'm seeing in the message message
[51:57] because what we recognize that God has
[51:59] not called you or me to stand in that
[52:02] office of a prophet but God has given to
[52:06] us he would show us glimpses that as a
[52:08] prophet if you remember a prophet would
[52:11] be one that would display even
[52:13] conditions as they would show in Israel
[52:16] they would show certain conditions that
[52:17] would be at God would have them to act
[52:20] certain things out but this this portion
[52:22] of it that God would this this little
[52:25] insight we would have with brother Bram
[52:27] in here is God would allow you and I to
[52:30] know the quality of the holy spirit that
[52:33] we have within us if if we can just
[52:36] yield to him the same God that gave the
[52:39] prophet Grace there is the same God for
[52:42] our situations we don't have to be a
[52:46] prophet to act a certain way we we don't
[52:49] have that there a Prophet is one who is
[52:51] a Divine interpreter of the word of God
[52:54] like Daniel was like Joseph was On and
[52:56] On Through the scriptures so when we
[52:58] look at this brother Bram himself
[53:01] remember at that point in time he he was
[53:04] getting ready he said in his mind what
[53:06] he felt like doing when Rebecca walked
[53:09] out of the house and when his when her
[53:11] mother you know coming later on had
[53:13] asked her not to be playing those songs
[53:15] in the house she walked out the out the
[53:17] door slammed the door and said what do
[53:20] you want me to be some old Wallflower
[53:22] now brother Bram could have that was a
[53:24] trap this isn't Sunday service but that
[53:26] was a trap that's his Spirit Well no
[53:29] doubt it was what was Satan trying to do
[53:32] provoke him it was trying to get him to
[53:35] act out in order to bring a further
[53:38] dissension than where she's already
[53:41] dealing sister Rebecca is already
[53:43] dealing with issues of an
[53:46] 18-year-old and if God can get the
[53:48] prophet drawn out into the flesh where
[53:51] he acts out in the flesh in regards to
[53:54] it it's only going to further build a
[53:57] wedge between
[53:59] them are you with me now oh now now
[54:02] notice why brother bam approaches this
[54:04] here in the right the word for the right
[54:07] season he comes along and he says what I
[54:10] felt like doing was going out after her
[54:13] and taking my belt after her he said but
[54:15] I can't do that right now she's 18 years
[54:20] old now if your son or daughter is still
[54:23] five the belt still
[54:25] applies but everything has to be done in
[54:28] the right Spirit right is that right yes
[54:31] you see even when brother Brandon
[54:32] mentioned that right there that was out
[54:33] of frustration that was out of of that
[54:36] but notice now here the spirit of God as
[54:39] a prophet would allow the Holy Spirit to
[54:42] have the rideway he said to he said to
[54:45] Sister mey he said mey she's 18 years
[54:48] old and he said these kids need a
[54:54] buddy beautiful
[54:56] he said we have to think 18y old
[55:01] thoughts now how however how old brother
[55:04] brandham was at the time you know that
[55:07] was going to be something that he was
[55:09] going to have to be able to enter into
[55:12] but how could he enter into that to
[55:14] think 18yearold thoughts now I want you
[55:16] to think of this now here is the prophet
[55:18] of God that is bringing to you and I the
[55:21] revelation of the word g is a channel
[55:25] but all even because he was the prophet
[55:27] of God God allowed him to be ex be able
[55:30] to experience the things of where the
[55:32] children would pass through that of the
[55:35] adolescence all of their times that they
[55:37] would come through and God permitted all
[55:40] of that it wasn't an act God allowed all
[55:43] of that so when you and I might have a
[55:45] window and an Insight that it's not just
[55:48] even don't limit this to where it's just
[55:50] that of teenage children it's showing us
[55:53] sometimes the response that we need we
[55:56] need the discernment of the Holy Spirit
[55:59] to not respond based on what we feel but
[56:03] respond based on what is needed in the
[56:08] season because what is in the season
[56:11] will actually be helpful at that time
[56:15] and this is why in everything that we do
[56:19] we have to be sensitive we we want to be
[56:21] sensitive to the Holy Spirit to know God
[56:24] what is it that I need we would you
[56:26] would have me to say if there's
[56:28] something to say during this time
[56:30] because when it's all said and done I
[56:33] want to be a help to the body I want to
[56:36] be a help to somebody else and not just
[56:38] to the body I want to be a help to some
[56:41] that they may never even darken the
[56:42] doors of this church they may not even
[56:45] walk in the doors of any church I want
[56:48] to be a help to
[56:51] humanity yes sir amen is that right yeah
[56:56] I believe we feel that way as
[56:59] Believers and when God would ask a
[57:02] question you know of you and I and like
[57:06] job was asking questions there job was
[57:09] asking questions not that he wanted
[57:11] answers to but questions that bill dad
[57:15] and elas and the other they should have
[57:17] just stopped and said wait a minute here
[57:19] the I need a moment of
[57:21] reflection to actually stop and think
[57:25] how am I helping how am I strengthening
[57:29] others what kind of counsel am I giving
[57:32] so good how am I being a help now you
[57:34] know every one of us is just like when
[57:36] we go into the doctor and we can say
[57:38] well I think everything's going pretty
[57:40] good but blood work don't lie right
[57:43] scans don't lie and I say it like this
[57:46] with the Holy Spirit we want the great
[57:49] scan of the holy spirit because I
[57:51] realize those instruments they can get
[57:53] your results mixed up with somebody else
[57:56] name on
[57:57] it I realize those things can show up
[58:00] things that they they've got the wrong
[58:03] results I understand that but in this
[58:05] moment of standing in the presence of
[58:08] the word I want the word to examine not
[58:11] only my life but I believe that God
[58:13] would speak to us in this way that Lord
[58:16] perhaps there's ways that I could be
[58:18] helping that I'm not helping and I'm not
[58:21] a rare of it Lord so help me to be
[58:23] sensitive to the hour and the season
[58:27] that I'm living in in other words not to
[58:29] apply things just of the past but help
[58:32] me to be in season and out of
[58:36] season amen and I think we've seen that
[58:39] example as I was rehearsing that there
[58:42] of sister Rebecca there in the house of
[58:44] how to think 18-year-old thoughts that
[58:47] would be challenging to be able to go
[58:49] back into that place which we all have
[58:52] as children and you know what it's not
[58:54] just as children but sometimes when a
[58:56] brother or sister or something's a
[58:57] little indifferent it's a place to say
[59:00] to be able to have enough Grace to say
[59:03] Lord I don't know what's going on maybe
[59:05] something in their mind something in
[59:07] their heart I don't understand what it
[59:09] is but you know Lord that's my brother
[59:12] that's my sister don't let me just look
[59:15] at the outside and make a judgment or an
[59:19] interpretation but give me the
[59:21] discernment of the holy spirit that you
[59:24] might be a help through
[59:28] me I'm just speaking from my heart
[59:31] friends Hallelujah when the Lord begin
[59:34] to deal with me on this on Saturday
[59:36] there in the in the evening and these
[59:38] things just begin to roll and come and
[59:40] begin to look at it through the
[59:42] scripture of how hast thou helped him
[59:45] that is without power sometimes as we're
[59:47] looking around we we can look at one
[59:49] another you might even see a smiling
[59:52] face but you don't know what is down
[59:54] there and what that person might be
[59:56] going through and you can just assume
[1:00:00] everything's all right and they might be
[1:00:02] so overwhelmed and so
[1:00:07] overcome I tell you my
[1:00:10] heart few Saturdays
[1:00:13] ago we had a text and some of you no
[1:00:15] doubt probably watched the funeral there
[1:00:17] were brother uh brother Donnie Reagan
[1:00:20] and there's actually a brother that went
[1:00:21] to Brother Mike walls he had had contact
[1:00:23] there with brother Donnie and them
[1:00:26] brother Nathaniel And I as soon
[1:00:28] as my wife and I we got a text and I
[1:00:32] thought no way no way and when I got
[1:00:35] that text then sure enough then um here
[1:00:39] a sister called from in that area and
[1:00:42] called and begin to speak to my wife and
[1:00:45] I my wife and I were stepping out to get
[1:00:47] something just something real quick to
[1:00:49] eat and so I could get back in the
[1:00:50] office and I don't I just sat in the
[1:00:53] parking lot and I just wept
[1:00:56] I wept I said God help me help me make
[1:01:01] me sensitive make me more sensitive Lord
[1:01:04] to the needs that are present it just so
[1:01:07] so burdened my heart within that
[1:01:10] situation that where the brother you
[1:01:12] know he through through the situation
[1:01:14] had come to such a place and would take
[1:01:16] his life and but yet a real a real
[1:01:18] genuine believer I could read you quotes
[1:01:20] on this where brother B talks about the
[1:01:23] strength of the seal holding out and I
[1:01:25] got to looking at that and the burden
[1:01:27] that was upon my heart I said oh God
[1:01:29] help me to be sensitive and I I told her
[1:01:31] I said I don't even know if we're going
[1:01:32] to be able to go in and get something to
[1:01:34] eat I this is just it's overwhelming on
[1:01:36] my heart with this right here God
[1:01:39] there's there's so many needs and I say
[1:01:40] it to you because it's not just among
[1:01:43] older ones I don't know in a countless
[1:01:45] youth meeting after youth meeting and
[1:01:47] I've been in and seen young people that
[1:01:49] are dealing with some of these things
[1:01:51] that what might seem okay on the outside
[1:01:55] but down on the inside there's things
[1:01:58] that are going on but I'm glad that
[1:02:01] there is a
[1:02:03] God who
[1:02:06] cares he cares about your thoughts he
[1:02:09] cares about what you're going through
[1:02:11] the prophet said he's interested in what
[1:02:15] you anticipate in he's interested in all
[1:02:19] that's wrong he's interested in
[1:02:23] you hallall
[1:02:26] yeah the
[1:02:28] Lord just just as I become burning I I
[1:02:32] certainly didn't didn't know that we
[1:02:34] were even coming into this place here in
[1:02:37] job 26 as a matter of fact I had not
[1:02:39] even the intention or looking at this
[1:02:41] chapter many other chapters ahead and
[1:02:43] looking at it but the Holy Spirit begin
[1:02:45] to just pick this up and just Inspire it
[1:02:48] to my heart being a help to the body and
[1:02:51] how are you helping the body I'm I'm
[1:02:53] asking that question is not just put to
[1:02:55] you it's put to me and it's put to me in
[1:02:59] the sense that I this is how that I have
[1:03:01] prayed is God help me to be sensitive
[1:03:04] and Lord give me the discernment that I
[1:03:06] need at the time to listen and what to
[1:03:08] say and what words to say Lord Give Me
[1:03:11] Lord Jesus what the discernment that I
[1:03:14] need for this moment and this season
[1:03:17] amen cuz sometimes the discernment we
[1:03:20] need is we just need to be good
[1:03:22] listeners there you go there you go and
[1:03:25] Satan will tempt us to say something and
[1:03:28] you said Satan will tempt you to yes
[1:03:30] Satan can tempt you to say something you
[1:03:32] say how do I know that is Satan because
[1:03:34] it's always accompanied with
[1:03:38] anxiousness right the Holy Spirit we
[1:03:40] we're to speak the truth in love not
[1:03:43] anxiously that I got to force this in
[1:03:45] there that I got to get this in there
[1:03:46] that I got to correct this that's not
[1:03:48] the Holy Spirit that's Satan wanting to
[1:03:51] bring confusion and trying to put a
[1:03:54] wedge there but God is called you to be
[1:03:56] a channel you and me and he's given us
[1:03:59] the grace if you'll just wait on him
[1:04:01] he'll give you what help is needed even
[1:04:04] if it's to step back and say let's try
[1:04:07] to think 18-year-old thoughts let's be a
[1:04:11] buddy come on now sister mey didn't tell
[1:04:14] Rebecca well you know what you can play
[1:04:15] any rock and roll song you want because
[1:04:17] we're just going to be your buddy no
[1:04:19] that wasn't the right kind of buddy but
[1:04:21] she said honey she said I want you to
[1:04:24] know brother BR told her exactly what to
[1:04:26] say you know that's not welcome here in
[1:04:29] this house because the Lord has given us
[1:04:32] this house we are we are his children we
[1:04:35] are his servants now I want you to know
[1:04:38] that you might you might want to go that
[1:04:40] way but I want you to know that Mommy
[1:04:42] and Daddy are your buddies we're going
[1:04:45] to be your friends now it didn't mean
[1:04:47] that they were just taking their hands
[1:04:49] off and and where however she wanted to
[1:04:51] go but it meant that it's got to be
[1:04:53] somebody that's willing and able to
[1:04:55] stand there in the midst of that time
[1:04:58] and Minister the help that's needed in
[1:05:01] that hour oh I tell you as a
[1:05:06] parent sometimes you look back and you
[1:05:08] think there were years of three and four
[1:05:10] and five and six those were the we look
[1:05:12] at and say those were the cake years
[1:05:15] right and I don't really want to say
[1:05:17] that they were the cake years but
[1:05:19] because I know some of you are in that
[1:05:20] in those Realms I I don't mean that cuz
[1:05:22] it's every every year every year you go
[1:05:24] through it it it takes out of you so I
[1:05:26] don't don't misunderstand me but even as
[1:05:29] they as they get older I I've shared
[1:05:30] this with you that I I don't even in
[1:05:32] myself I it's not been less time I I I'm
[1:05:35] I'm I'm looking at it in things to where
[1:05:38] that if I see something a little going a
[1:05:40] little r or I feel something in my
[1:05:41] spirit my wife feels a little something
[1:05:43] her spirit I want to get right with it I
[1:05:45] I don't want to I don't want to get with
[1:05:47] it in the terms of we don't do this and
[1:05:48] we don't do that hey come on we we need
[1:05:50] to have some time to talk and I want to
[1:05:52] hear their heart right amen I want to
[1:05:55] know know what's on your heart I want to
[1:05:58] hear that and and God give me the grace
[1:06:00] and the wisdom to how to help them and
[1:06:03] guide them because you know what I was
[1:06:05] that age at one time I remember that
[1:06:08] it's like some of my boys I can look
[1:06:10] across the table and say now you're
[1:06:12] wondering how I how I know that that
[1:06:14] that's not a spiritual discernment I you
[1:06:16] and I think
[1:06:18] alike so I know how you think there you
[1:06:21] so let me just tell you what you're
[1:06:22] thinking on here and what you're
[1:06:24] thinking on there
[1:06:27] that's good yeah now I'm saying it and I
[1:06:30] just you know within these parts that
[1:06:32] you know what sometimes the things that
[1:06:34] you know the ways that we look at being
[1:06:37] a help sometimes you know I think maybe
[1:06:40] sometimes we've been like Bill dad in
[1:06:41] life has and we're looked at that this
[1:06:43] is's going to be a help but God knows
[1:06:45] what is needed to bring the help and
[1:06:48] what needs to be done at the right time
[1:06:51] I mean who would have ever thought that
[1:06:53] the minister presenting his wife with a
[1:06:55] of chocolates and talking sweet to her
[1:06:58] would have cast out a
[1:07:01] devil come
[1:07:02] on right you sisters are like chocolate
[1:07:05] you ought have been shouting on that one
[1:07:07] elbowing and ribbon or something but you
[1:07:09] see it it was the approach right yeah it
[1:07:12] was the approach so these
[1:07:15] Brethren I I don't I'm just going to say
[1:07:17] it from my heart I don't believe they
[1:07:19] had the wrong
[1:07:20] intentions I don't believe Bill Dad and
[1:07:23] life ass went there and the other went
[1:07:25] there said we're just going to strip him
[1:07:27] down I don't believe they had the wrong
[1:07:31] intentions but they had the wrong
[1:07:36] discernment and if there's one thing in
[1:07:38] this hour that we we need you know the
[1:07:41] Bible tells us within that of
[1:07:43] discernment it says that that strong
[1:07:46] meat belongeth to them that are full age
[1:07:49] to discern good from Evil let me tell
[1:07:51] you something the sharpening of our
[1:07:53] discernment in our lives is as we stay
[1:07:57] in his presence and we feed upon the
[1:07:59] word of God that's what brings
[1:08:01] discernment to what is good and what is
[1:08:04] evil and I'm talking about even in our
[1:08:07] thoughts and and the way the words that
[1:08:09] we would say we're living so close to
[1:08:12] him until we speak like he speaks think
[1:08:15] like he thinks act like he acts that's
[1:08:19] the privilege we have as the children of
[1:08:21] God to live behind the veil yes Lord
[1:08:25] Glory aren't you thankful for that
[1:08:27] friends I I'm so grateful for that and I
[1:08:31] I want to just say it in this way if we
[1:08:32] look at this being a help to the body
[1:08:35] look at this scripture here it says in
[1:08:37] all things it behooved him to be made
[1:08:40] like unto his Brethren that he might be
[1:08:43] a merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:08:46] things pertaining to God to make
[1:08:48] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:08:51] people notice the objective of our high
[1:08:55] priest right is
[1:08:57] reconciliation right it's reconciling
[1:08:59] it's bringing in Harmony in unity that's
[1:09:03] what the spirit of God it draws upon
[1:09:05] Harmony and unity for in that he himself
[1:09:08] hath suffered being tempted he is able
[1:09:12] to secur them that are tempted this word
[1:09:16] sucur when job like was asked he asked
[1:09:19] the question how hast thou helped that
[1:09:21] word that word help there is the same as
[1:09:24] this word meaning that how how hast thou
[1:09:28] supported how hast thou helped come to
[1:09:32] the aid of one who is without
[1:09:39] power now watch this here in the Hebrew
[1:09:41] series brother Ram says suur means to
[1:09:45] sympathize now there'll be some things
[1:09:47] let's just be honest some things we
[1:09:50] can't sympathize we empathize CU if I've
[1:09:54] not been through it I I can't sympathize
[1:09:56] but I can empathize y let me give you an
[1:09:58] example it's like a nurse who walks into
[1:10:01] your room and you have to have an iv put
[1:10:04] in and she walks in the
[1:10:07] room and you know sometimes you know
[1:10:09] bedside maners is everything oh yeah oh
[1:10:13] yeah they can walk in the room and treat
[1:10:14] you like a piece of Machinery maybe
[1:10:17] they've had a bad night maybe that's
[1:10:18] just how they are I I don't know I I'm
[1:10:20] not going to say that but when you
[1:10:22] understand that when they walk in you
[1:10:24] appreciate that time of where they'll
[1:10:27] not only put in the alcohol but they're
[1:10:29] talking with you and just kind of guing
[1:10:31] taking those extra moments rather than
[1:10:34] just saying hey give me the
[1:10:36] arm you
[1:10:38] appreciate that little bit of empathy
[1:10:40] now I know we might turn our heads and
[1:10:41] say you know they tell us to turn our
[1:10:43] heads so we don't Flinch you you
[1:10:45] appreciate all of that extra little what
[1:10:47] we call bedside care that that little
[1:10:51] bit of extra bedside care can be the can
[1:10:54] be the difference between them finding
[1:10:57] the right vein and not finding it it can
[1:11:00] be the difference between you walking
[1:11:01] out of there with only one spot black
[1:11:03] and blue rather than having a whole arm
[1:11:06] that's black and
[1:11:07] blue is that right but it takes a little
[1:11:10] bit for that nurse to actually
[1:11:13] understand that that her job or job
[1:11:15] description does it goes so far beyond
[1:11:19] what's written by the hospital or the
[1:11:21] doctor's office it actually has to be a
[1:11:24] Feeling that she has for that patient or
[1:11:28] that person suffering it'll change the
[1:11:31] entire atmosphere or situation that's
[1:11:34] there is that right amen so notice
[1:11:38] brother re says sakur means to
[1:11:40] sympathize that's the reason he become
[1:11:43] this he become he might be sympathetic
[1:11:46] with you you as you have your ups and
[1:11:48] downs and your little ins and outs and
[1:11:51] your Temptations get so great you can't
[1:11:53] hardly stand it he knows knows how to
[1:11:55] sympathize with you he sets there to
[1:11:58] make intercession he sets there to love
[1:12:01] you thank you Father you say well how
[1:12:04] can he understand ups and downs he never
[1:12:06] was up and down he never was in and out
[1:12:09] you say how can he experience that he
[1:12:11] listen the Bible said in that he was
[1:12:14] tempted he suffered suffered means that
[1:12:17] he actually went through a sensible
[1:12:22] experience brother man tells us in deity
[1:12:24] of Jesus Christ he was tempted with
[1:12:27] sexual Temptation he was tempted with
[1:12:30] drinking what are you saying he had to
[1:12:32] turn his head Brothers just like you do
[1:12:35] he felt the same pull a spirit that
[1:12:38] would want to pull him he felt that why
[1:12:41] he didn't have to do that but he did it
[1:12:44] so he might be the right kind of
[1:12:46] mediator in you and
[1:12:50] me and yet he was without sin because he
[1:12:54] was the pasc
[1:12:57] lamb and that imparting of his life into
[1:13:00] you and I brings us in to the sacrifice
[1:13:04] and the desire of our heart is to please
[1:13:07] him so even in our times of up and down
[1:13:12] now your up and down time may not have
[1:13:14] been where you were out of church a week
[1:13:17] right but your up and down time might
[1:13:19] have been sitting right here and you're
[1:13:20] down one week and up the next week
[1:13:25] sometimes we get down sometimes the
[1:13:28] cares of life I tell you what would be a
[1:13:30] good thing when you see someone a
[1:13:32] brother or sister says they're just not
[1:13:34] like themselves don't pour it on them
[1:13:37] but lift them up in prayer say Lord help
[1:13:40] my brother help my sister Lord I I don't
[1:13:43] know what they're going through I don't
[1:13:44] even know what kind of mind battles or
[1:13:46] what news they've received today Lord
[1:13:49] but God would you help them
[1:13:53] Lord sometimes you can look at some
[1:13:55] somebody else and say well it seems like
[1:13:56] they're up and down and up and down also
[1:13:58] remember every one of us are made up
[1:14:01] differently that's right brother Bram
[1:14:04] tells us of those of the different
[1:14:05] temperaments and makeups he himself was
[1:14:08] a Melancholy person which means High
[1:14:11] passion Melancholy could be up here and
[1:14:13] soar and everything so great but then
[1:14:15] let them get down in
[1:14:17] here that's a temperament and God listen
[1:14:21] through this listen now if God if God
[1:14:23] allowed you and me to be in such a place
[1:14:27] where we just soared the heavenlies all
[1:14:29] the times I would love that but if he
[1:14:32] didn't allow me to come down I would
[1:14:34] never be able to minister to you in the
[1:14:37] right way amen if I never came through
[1:14:41] times that I feel so alone times that I
[1:14:44] feel so discouraged times that I feel
[1:14:47] like is there anything taking place oh
[1:14:52] God if God did not allow allow me to
[1:14:55] come that way how could I minister to
[1:14:58] you and I'm not just talking about
[1:15:00] preach but I'm talking about being able
[1:15:03] to minister to you w I've realized more
[1:15:05] and more as I go on and I keep learning
[1:15:08] that God permits circumstances and
[1:15:11] situations because a minister is not one
[1:15:14] that can put a bunch of scriptures and
[1:15:16] quotes together but a minister is one
[1:15:19] who is indeed that I said God I don't
[1:15:21] want to preach sermons I want to
[1:15:23] minister to the
[1:15:26] body the devil can preach
[1:15:29] sermons J listen Judas was a man that
[1:15:33] could preach the prophet said he shared
[1:15:35] knowledge in the Mysteries Second To
[1:15:40] None Judas was a masterful preacher if
[1:15:44] we could say it like this in terminology
[1:15:46] that we've heard referred to Prince of
[1:15:51] preachers but it wasn't a minister
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:55] I don't know about you but I don't want
[1:15:56] to be a preacher I want to be a minister
[1:15:59] amen I want to be a
[1:16:03] servant I say God help me I want to be a
[1:16:06] servant there's things that Lord that
[1:16:08] you see that needs to be diverted or
[1:16:11] change this way that this is not an
[1:16:13] outline in anything that God would give
[1:16:15] me God knows what he's doing it may just
[1:16:17] be that God has these things out here
[1:16:19] that it would so resonate in my spirit
[1:16:21] and he would take it and minister to the
[1:16:24] very need of his
[1:16:28] children maybe you all are just sitting
[1:16:30] here and getting a window as I preach to
[1:16:31] myself
[1:16:37] tonight and though you go astray I love
[1:16:40] this he won't forsake you amen he will
[1:16:43] still come after you and knock at your
[1:16:46] heart there's not a backslider in the
[1:16:48] building but what know that God knocks
[1:16:50] at his heart daily and he will do it as
[1:16:53] long as you're a mortal on this Earth
[1:16:55] for he's loved you he's redeemed you
[1:16:58] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory be
[1:17:02] to God God knows how to minister help to
[1:17:04] us don't
[1:17:06] he why I want to we want to be a
[1:17:08] comforter I want to be a comforter
[1:17:10] there's times when we need God we need
[1:17:13] god with skin on
[1:17:16] it oh
[1:17:18] absolutely you know he is the comforter
[1:17:22] but you know he's he he he ministers
[1:17:24] Comfort through our lives to one another
[1:17:28] oh yeah let's just take a little bit of
[1:17:29] a journey here in the scriptures Paul
[1:17:32] and this is one of my I love this
[1:17:33] passage of scripture in 2 Corinthians
[1:17:35] chapter 1 and verse three Paul said
[1:17:37] blessed be God even the father of our
[1:17:40] Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies
[1:17:44] and the God of All Comfort who comforted
[1:17:48] Us in all our
[1:17:51] tribulation not just when I got out of
[1:17:54] it but in the midst of
[1:17:56] it he still comes to fiery
[1:18:00] furnaces he still comes to Lion's
[1:18:03] dims he ministers comfort in all our
[1:18:08] tribulations
[1:18:11] hallelu oh thank you Lord Lord why that
[1:18:15] we may be able to comfort them which are
[1:18:18] in any trouble by the Comfort wherewith
[1:18:22] we ourselves are com comforted hallah of
[1:18:27] God hallu that's so beautiful hallu to
[1:18:31] me I don't think I think it's so
[1:18:33] powerful that throughout the body right
[1:18:35] here that when there's times that
[1:18:38] sometimes I can know something that
[1:18:39] maybe one and you you all know this that
[1:18:42] that's been around here for a while if
[1:18:44] if I can find that somebody else is
[1:18:45] going through something and I'm not
[1:18:47] talking about something that shouldn't
[1:18:48] be disclosed but maybe it's something
[1:18:50] with a job maybe it's situations maybe
[1:18:52] it's something you know it's something
[1:18:54] that in other words that that would not
[1:18:56] be it's not withheld from an order
[1:18:58] somebody to give a testimony to somebody
[1:19:00] else about oh brother and sister when
[1:19:03] you have been through certain things
[1:19:04] like that why would I not recommend
[1:19:07] somebody else and say listen not only
[1:19:10] will God he's with you in this he'll
[1:19:12] bring you through it but here's a
[1:19:13] brother here's a sister why don't you
[1:19:15] talk with them because they've been
[1:19:17] right through it and right there and
[1:19:19] they themselves will know exactly how to
[1:19:22] pray with you that's God working through
[1:19:26] the
[1:19:28] body hallelujah we're not under nicadan
[1:19:31] ISM where it all has to be the pastor he
[1:19:34] is the holy spirit that works through
[1:19:37] the
[1:19:41] body
[1:19:44] Hallelujah so why were you comforted why
[1:19:47] was I comforted in my tribulation that
[1:19:50] we might be able to be a comfort to
[1:19:53] someone else
[1:19:56] I say God help me to be
[1:19:58] sensitive whether brother Aaron Brother
[1:20:00] Ray brother Samuel brother Bill somebody
[1:20:02] tells me hey brother so and so that help
[1:20:04] me to be sensitive Lord that if you deal
[1:20:06] with my heart help me to just be
[1:20:09] sensitive enough to say brother sister
[1:20:12] I'm praying for you maybe send them a
[1:20:14] text or a phone call you might say
[1:20:17] brother Samuel that's so little and
[1:20:18] insignificant let me tell you something
[1:20:21] the Lord Jesus will not even Overlook a
[1:20:24] cup of water being given to one who is
[1:20:27] in
[1:20:27] [Applause]
[1:20:30] need brother ra said sometimes we think
[1:20:33] things are so small and so little he
[1:20:35] said but God does not Overlook the
[1:20:38] little things you
[1:20:41] doen sometimes the very things that we
[1:20:43] think were so little insignificant and
[1:20:45] it isn't because we want some big name
[1:20:47] but you know sometimes we think well no
[1:20:49] maybe that's just me maybe that's just
[1:20:51] me when we should act on the pulsation
[1:20:54] of the Holy Spirit and say God as we
[1:20:56] minister to that brother or that sister
[1:20:58] maybe just sending a text for him
[1:21:00] brother you're on my heart today I want
[1:21:02] you to know I'm praying for you you're
[1:21:05] in prayer I'm lifting you up before the
[1:21:07] Throne of
[1:21:09] God I never forget I think it was at the
[1:21:12] beginning of 2015 or somewhere like that
[1:21:14] I don't remember the exact date brother
[1:21:16] Andrew Glover would probably remember it
[1:21:17] better than I would in that sense but if
[1:21:19] somewhere wrong that time and I woke up
[1:21:21] early that morning I had brother Andrew
[1:21:22] in my heart so so deeply I I just I said
[1:21:26] oh God I I don't know what it is and I
[1:21:28] just begin to pray and I got downstairs
[1:21:31] real early I begin to pray and I sent
[1:21:33] him a text and I just sent him a text
[1:21:36] and he said brother he said just keep
[1:21:38] praying I'll be with you in a little
[1:21:40] while little did I know he was there in
[1:21:42] India at that time and the authorities
[1:21:45] had been called on that meeting and they
[1:21:48] were trying to get them out of that
[1:21:50] meeting at that time and get them on a
[1:21:53] train and send them to another place oh
[1:21:56] my let me tell you something the same
[1:21:58] God knows about your need he knows about
[1:22:01] my need and what if I would have just
[1:22:03] taken it in that way I believe I don't
[1:22:05] believe that I had to send that text but
[1:22:07] I felt to send that text on I felt
[1:22:11] descended I didn't know what the
[1:22:14] severity of the situation was where the
[1:22:17] authorities were coming in to break up
[1:22:19] that religious meeting but God knew and
[1:22:22] God interceded friends don't don't you
[1:22:24] see the value God don't let me to become
[1:22:27] so
[1:22:29] Earthbound to where I'm not sensitive
[1:22:32] enough to
[1:22:34] you you see how Satan wants to get us so
[1:22:38] Earthbound to what we're thinking about
[1:22:40] is the next Earthly
[1:22:42] step listen friends we walk in this
[1:22:45] Humanity the holy spirit's not here
[1:22:47] condemning us I just say God help us to
[1:22:50] be aware of it it's Satan's desire he
[1:22:53] wants to get us into an earth bound
[1:22:55] thinking in EarthBound way because
[1:22:56] sometimes TR to be honest with you you
[1:22:58] know what I'm talking about emotionally
[1:23:00] and mentally we are exhausted at times
[1:23:04] from the day from the spiritual warfare
[1:23:07] that has been taking place and going on
[1:23:09] it don't even seem like you've got the
[1:23:11] strength sometimes to drive home the
[1:23:13] strength to move on and the strength to
[1:23:15] even do the simplest of thing sending a
[1:23:18] text making a call doing a phone doing a
[1:23:21] phone call but let me tell you something
[1:23:23] one of the greatest ways to receive
[1:23:25] strength in your life is to be a channel
[1:23:28] for the strength of God to flow through
[1:23:30] because you are anointed and ordained as
[1:23:33] part of the body of Jesus Christ you are
[1:23:36] not an impostor you are part of the body
[1:23:40] you are not some prosthetic that's been
[1:23:42] stuck on but you are a part of the body
[1:23:45] you've been born of the same holy spirit
[1:23:48] amen yes
[1:23:49] sir
[1:23:51] hallelujah oh God help us for as the
[1:23:53] sufferings
[1:23:55] of Christ abound in us so our
[1:23:57] consolation also aboundeth by Christ and
[1:24:01] whether we be afflicted it's for your
[1:24:03] consolation and salvation which is
[1:24:06] effectual in the enduring of the same
[1:24:08] sufferings we also suffer and whether we
[1:24:11] be comforted it's for your consolation
[1:24:14] and salvation and our hope of you is
[1:24:17] steadfast knowing that as you are
[1:24:20] partakers of the sufferings so shall you
[1:24:23] be also of the
[1:24:25] consolation Paul and these apostles were
[1:24:28] attacked because of the word they
[1:24:30] brought Satan tried to block it off he
[1:24:33] would try to hinder him but you know why
[1:24:36] Satan knew the power within that word
[1:24:40] and when that word would find Residence
[1:24:42] in the hearts of the Believers Satan
[1:24:45] would want to turn against that believer
[1:24:47] and turn against maybe that group of
[1:24:49] Believers but this is the strength
[1:24:52] whereby those Believers were able to
[1:24:54] live Victorious is by the comfort of the
[1:24:57] Holy Spirit as it would be ministered
[1:25:00] through Paul as a channel that is so
[1:25:04] good and others yes how many want to be
[1:25:07] a channel I I I I want to be a comforter
[1:25:10] a comforter means you remember in the
[1:25:12] scripture says I will not leave you
[1:25:16] comfortless I won't leave you
[1:25:20] alone oh my
[1:25:24] look at this living and dying buried
[1:25:27] rising and coming he Saidi so glad to
[1:25:29] know that he can be found amongst the
[1:25:31] Brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not
[1:25:34] one that would leave us he stands by us
[1:25:37] when all has failed and the last hopes
[1:25:40] of Earthly reaching has come to its end
[1:25:42] he is still God and he loves us he was
[1:25:45] the expressing of God brother brah goes
[1:25:49] on to say oh how I believe that he Longs
[1:25:51] for his people to be so anointed Ed with
[1:25:55] his spirit that he that we could go to
[1:25:58] each other in trials and troubles and
[1:26:02] give the expression of his sympathy not
[1:26:06] my sympathy his
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:10] sympathy I hope you don't misunderstand
[1:26:12] me I get texts from all over the world
[1:26:14] I'm on different threads with brothers
[1:26:15] and pastors from all over the world I'm
[1:26:17] on other threads that are Pastors in
[1:26:19] certain regions and certain things like
[1:26:21] that there's all sorts of requests that
[1:26:23] come through and you know you you you
[1:26:25] put it down and to pray for that request
[1:26:27] as well too and and sometimes it might
[1:26:29] be if God lays up on our heart like I
[1:26:31] said before like that with happen with
[1:26:33] brother Andrew that maybe that text
[1:26:35] would be but let me just tell you
[1:26:36] something God never called me to Pastor
[1:26:38] any other
[1:26:40] body I love brothers and sisters all
[1:26:42] around but let me tell you something
[1:26:44] where my focus is at it's right here
[1:26:46] right right even if I'm not standing
[1:26:50] right here and God sees fit to take the
[1:26:52] gift here and Minister there my my heart
[1:26:54] is right here my prayers are right here
[1:26:57] I'm praying and looking many times
[1:26:59] studying for needs right here in the
[1:27:02] assembly even though I'm out somewhere
[1:27:04] else but studying for what's present
[1:27:06] right here hallelujah so what are you
[1:27:08] saying brother Samuel God might use me
[1:27:11] or you or somebody else to minister he
[1:27:13] has done that to others in other
[1:27:15] assemblies but listen friends when it
[1:27:17] all comes down to it at the end of the
[1:27:19] day it's what have we done with those
[1:27:22] that God has put around us
[1:27:25] it would be like being a husband that is
[1:27:27] absolutely uh here is a man that does
[1:27:30] everything so
[1:27:32] perfect but not in his own
[1:27:35] home or a wife vice versa you would say
[1:27:38] something's wrong with that but you see
[1:27:40] God has put us together as a
[1:27:42] body that's not me looking at Lord I I
[1:27:45] I'll do this for so and so over there
[1:27:47] but no let me be so Anointed with your
[1:27:50] spirit Lord that I might be able to
[1:27:53] minister to to someone else right here
[1:27:56] that's in need notice do not to be so
[1:28:00] Anointed with his spirit that I would
[1:28:01] walk on the water that I would pray for
[1:28:03] the sick and they would get well but to
[1:28:05] be so Anointed with his spirit that we
[1:28:08] could go to each other in trials and in
[1:28:12] troubles amen and give the
[1:28:16] expression of his
[1:28:19] sympathy as it pours from our heart
[1:28:25] that's been born of his Spirit to
[1:28:28] reflect in the church the love of the
[1:28:31] Living God oh yeah
[1:28:34] Hallelujah now if you can receive it in
[1:28:36] the right
[1:28:37] way even where the enemy would want to
[1:28:39] back you up and say well you can't do
[1:28:41] this because you can't speak good you
[1:28:43] can't do this because you know you can
[1:28:46] you you're just not able don't don't
[1:28:47] don't let the enemy back you up on it no
[1:28:50] no say uhuh I'm part of this I'm part of
[1:28:52] his sympathy
[1:28:54] I'm part of the
[1:28:56] sympathy I'm part I'm a chain I don't
[1:29:00] get to choose who it is but Lord let me
[1:29:03] be part where the where the sympathy in
[1:29:05] other words can be a help to somebody
[1:29:07] else let me be a
[1:29:09] Channel friends listen if we just step
[1:29:11] back just a little bit and you know what
[1:29:13] instead of instead of just let me just
[1:29:15] say it this way so you understand it
[1:29:17] instead of it just being and looking at
[1:29:18] I know sometimes we have requests
[1:29:20] brother Samuel how's this one doing
[1:29:21] brother Samuel how this doing maybe
[1:29:23] sometimes if we step back and we
[1:29:24] ourselves actually called as
[1:29:27] well and checked on somebody else well
[1:29:31] that's the pastor's responsibility well
[1:29:33] that's a it's we're a
[1:29:35] body right if my heart is hurting every
[1:29:39] part of my body ministers to my heart
[1:29:43] right not just one part of it don't
[1:29:45] underestimate your calling and your
[1:29:47] purpose of what God has for you to do in
[1:29:50] the
[1:29:51] body God has it so fitted that we would
[1:29:54] have the same care and compassion one
[1:29:56] for
[1:30:01] another is so good friends this is the
[1:30:03] working of the third pole Among Us yes
[1:30:06] it is the third pole is not a public
[1:30:08] show this is going to take place on the
[1:30:10] platform this in a prayer line the third
[1:30:12] poll is the working that is on in the
[1:30:15] private being displayed through our
[1:30:18] lives
[1:30:19] individually it's not a public show
[1:30:22] we're not going backwards it's for this
[1:30:24] word when you listen to the prophet as
[1:30:26] he brings the message humble thyself he
[1:30:29] brings it in such a way of how that
[1:30:31] third pool would actually work Among Us
[1:30:34] and remember the real Catalyst of the
[1:30:37] third pool is that of changing the
[1:30:40] changing in my
[1:30:43] life Hallelujah on oh I rejoice in the
[1:30:47] healing of the bodies I rejoice in
[1:30:49] Deliverance that's all part of it but
[1:30:51] the real reality is where the third pull
[1:30:54] bring about a body that actually is a
[1:30:57] servant to the leadership of the Holy
[1:31:02] Spirit to where he can say go here and
[1:31:05] we say Lord I don't understand it but

[1:31:21] thought it was jokey brother Bram tells
[1:31:23] us he thought it was jokey brother Bram
[1:31:25] said the very thing he thought was jokey
[1:31:26] was the very answer to his wife's
[1:31:29] healing you see what it took to him it
[1:31:31] was jokey it only took a prophet to
[1:31:33] point it out that it wasn't jokey this
[1:31:36] is your wife's healing the
[1:31:39] Lord I said God help us sometimes the
[1:31:43] things that we we

[1:32:14] problems and trials of Tomorrow will

[1:32:18] hold thy hand and walk through with thee
[1:32:20] brother BR says truly Lord he said pre
[1:32:23] pray Lord that thou would give us a deep
[1:32:26] seated compassion one for the other
[1:32:30] knowing that whilst we're in the
[1:32:32] deepness of trial and the hardness of
[1:32:35] testing we too one of these days shall
[1:32:38] go through like
[1:32:40] circumstances God give us the spirit of
[1:32:42] Jesus in us till we feel for each other
[1:32:47] enough until there will be Unity between
[1:32:51] us until we can serve thee
[1:32:54] together
[1:32:57] hallu what a
[1:32:59] prayer what a
[1:33:01] prayer Hallelujah I want you to think of
[1:33:05] this here this
[1:33:07] scripture look how Paul would write of
[1:33:10] this now the god of patience and
[1:33:13] consolation this is Comfort but it's
[1:33:16] also
[1:33:18] understanding that's that's something
[1:33:20] that within that we're talking about
[1:33:22] with discernment Lord give me me the
[1:33:24] right understanding for this
[1:33:27] moment how to approach this particular
[1:33:32] situation Grant you to be notice Grant
[1:33:35] you to be likeminded one toward another
[1:33:38] according to Christ Jesus so he's the
[1:33:41] standard and that God would grant you
[1:33:43] that this notice this is something that
[1:33:45] even in our Liv sometimes friends from
[1:33:47] the walks of life we come and it's not
[1:33:49] sometimes even from the walks of life
[1:33:51] sometimes it's the way that we're made
[1:33:53] up that we can get to looking at as
[1:33:55] though we're the kind of people that
[1:33:57] could sit in a corner and if nobody said
[1:33:59] hi it would not bother us whatsoever but
[1:34:03] remember remember you in yourself are
[1:34:07] not the body that's
[1:34:09] right I'm not the body the finger is not
[1:34:13] the body it's just a part of it so then
[1:34:15] we have to look beyond what we look at
[1:34:17] our needs cuz sometimes the what hinders
[1:34:19] us is we look at what we are and we than
[1:34:23] everybody else El ought to be the same
[1:34:24] way but everybody else isn't the same
[1:34:26] way as a matter of fact we're all going
[1:34:28] to be in places where we have need one
[1:34:31] from another and where I I tell you you
[1:34:33] know like it is brother Ram said he said
[1:34:35] I never knew what it meant to people he
[1:34:37] said when I would walk walk into the
[1:34:39] room he said and you come and visit
[1:34:41] people he not just himself he said but
[1:34:43] to have others he said I never really
[1:34:45] knew the depths of that until my mother
[1:34:47] was suffering on her deathbed and he
[1:34:50] said the different visits that was being
[1:34:53] paid to our home he said oh how much it
[1:34:55] meant as I seen brother Neville walk
[1:34:57] through the door how much it meant to
[1:34:59] see one another walk through the door
[1:35:01] listen don't ever underestimate and
[1:35:03] don't ever think that you have got to go
[1:35:05] there with some great big word listen
[1:35:08] your presence enough shows you
[1:35:11] care your text shows enough you care you
[1:35:15] don't have to write a great big thing
[1:35:18] but just that little bit and that moment
[1:35:20] in that time can express your care
[1:35:25] that is
[1:35:26] a brother Samuel this one needs to do
[1:35:29] this and needs to do that and needs to
[1:35:30] do this get them to the end
[1:35:34] first don't leave them stranded on
[1:35:37] Jericho
[1:35:39] Road that's another
[1:35:43] service this is what God has called us
[1:35:46] to
[1:35:47] do we want to we want to be a help I
[1:35:49] don't want to be according to what I
[1:35:51] think is a help but God give me the
[1:35:53] deser determent of this
[1:35:55] moment but I read this scripture here
[1:35:57] and I read it in a manner that you know
[1:35:59] what it tells me brother Shane is God
[1:36:00] will actually gift us he'll Grant to us
[1:36:04] he he'll he'll direct us on how to be
[1:36:08] likeminded like-minded don't mean we're
[1:36:10] all going to think exactly alike but we
[1:36:13] have the same understanding and it comes
[1:36:16] around that of the word we have that we
[1:36:18] have that same feeling one for another
[1:36:20] that you're not something separate
[1:36:22] you're a part of the body
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:27] right amen why that you may be one mind
[1:36:32] and one mouth glorify God even the
[1:36:34] father of our Lord Jesus
[1:36:38] Christ look at job's life it was a
[1:36:41] living
[1:36:44] testimony it was a testimony there's
[1:36:46] many places we can pull but I'm just
[1:36:48] going to pull from this point tonight
[1:36:50] this was a testimony this wasn't what
[1:36:51] job actually had said this this is
[1:36:53] something that elipas actually said it
[1:36:56] was a Liv testimony among others Now
[1:37:00] watch how watch how they view this
[1:37:03] elifas answers and says in verse two if
[1:37:05] we assay to commune with thee wil thou
[1:37:08] be grieved but who can withhold himself
[1:37:11] from
[1:37:12] speaking that probably would have been
[1:37:14] the best thing that a lifeas could have
[1:37:17] done at that
[1:37:20] time you see friends sometimes what it
[1:37:22] is is we feel like we've got to give an
[1:37:24] answer right we feel like we've got to
[1:37:27] and put things in such a way and we've
[1:37:29] got to say this and if we don't and
[1:37:30] wonder what it is if we don't say it we
[1:37:32] feel like we're a
[1:37:34] compromiser right you have to be
[1:37:37] remember it's your life that is Thunder
[1:37:40] against the
[1:37:42] devil it's your testimony that's the
[1:37:45] calling card that grants
[1:37:50] entrance that's that's what grants
[1:37:52] entrance
[1:37:54] on things is your testimony your life
[1:37:57] that
[1:37:58] care is that right now notice the
[1:38:02] greatest thing sometimes and probably as
[1:38:03] husbands we we've all learned this as
[1:38:06] husbands Sometimes the best thing is
[1:38:08] don't don't don't try to solve
[1:38:12] it just
[1:38:14] listen right cuz as a husband we're
[1:38:17] interested get right in there let's get
[1:38:19] right in let's just get this
[1:38:21] solved because we don't think that way
[1:38:23] as
[1:38:25] Men Let me refresh our memory for we're
[1:38:28] because of the age we're living in God
[1:38:31] made them hast thou not read God made
[1:38:33] them male and female in the
[1:38:37] beginning that's right I don't think
[1:38:39] like a woman thank God she don't think
[1:38:42] like a man thank
[1:38:44] God
[1:38:46] right and so sometimes those ways of
[1:38:48] thinking about things oh y'all getting
[1:38:50] quiet on me
[1:38:51] now woo
[1:38:54] maybe part two will just dwell right
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:58] here some of y'all come on get him off
[1:39:00] the ash sheep get him off the ash come
[1:39:03] on brother s we're going to pull right
[1:39:05] now but sometimes you know it doesn't
[1:39:07] make sense it does make sense cuz we
[1:39:10] feel like we have to have we got to give
[1:39:12] an answer
[1:39:14] somehow that's true and sometimes the
[1:39:16] greatest answer we can give is the care
[1:39:20] that's exhibited to just listening
[1:39:24] and not listening
[1:39:28] by what was that you
[1:39:32] said may I have your
[1:39:35] undivided
[1:39:38] attention see little things little
[1:39:40] things can so slip in and then it just
[1:39:43] becomes something that starts to be a
[1:39:45] dividing Factor resentment begins to
[1:39:48] build over things oh yes right just
[1:39:51] little things that'll just start start
[1:39:53] happening Lord how did we get
[1:39:58] here verse three behold thou Hast
[1:40:03] instructed this is his testimony this is
[1:40:05] what they're testifying thou Hast
[1:40:07] instructed many and thou has
[1:40:10] strengthened the weak hands what a
[1:40:12] testimony yeah many that's been overcome
[1:40:16] in things in their life you've
[1:40:18] instructed them sir yes yes
[1:40:21] sir so what what are you saying job was
[1:40:24] a Hands-On type of guy he was a Hands-On
[1:40:30] believer is that right this is this is
[1:40:32] what he was now notice thy words have
[1:40:34] upholding him that was Fallen prise God
[1:40:38] and thou has strengthen the feeble
[1:40:41] knees this was his
[1:40:44] testimony job was a channel he just
[1:40:47] didn't see great visions and great
[1:40:50] Inspirations and and speak this man had
[1:40:52] a testimony what he preached he
[1:40:56] lived God huj he was a living
[1:41:00] testimony and may I say it in this way I
[1:41:03] believe his
[1:41:05] congregation they caught that example as
[1:41:09] well I believe this message that God has
[1:41:12] so exemplified the character and example
[1:41:15] through and Life by the life of the
[1:41:17] messenger I don't know about you but
[1:41:18] when I hear about that man that stood
[1:41:20] there on the platform and brother randam
[1:41:22] was standing right back there with
[1:41:23] brother Billy Paul and he stood up there
[1:41:25] and said I'm regret to inform you
[1:41:27] brother brandom has not been able to
[1:41:28] make it tonight and he and Billy Paul
[1:41:31] are standing right there and Billy Paul
[1:41:33] said expose that liar he said no Billy
[1:41:35] let's go yeah amen drove around brother
[1:41:38] George gave me a little bit more insight
[1:41:40] on that building he said I'm going to
[1:41:41] drive around the front of the building I
[1:41:43] want you to get out and I want you to
[1:41:45] walk down across fromont the front the
[1:41:47] center section and walk out he said
[1:41:49] because people are going to see another
[1:41:51] advertisement and there's need needs in
[1:41:53] that building and they came there to be
[1:41:55] prayed for I want them to know that
[1:41:58] William brandham is a man of his word
[1:42:00] notice it wasn't about the
[1:42:03] brother I want the people's confidence
[1:42:06] not to be hindered and I don't want to
[1:42:09] blow up the meeting
[1:42:12] amen that was being a help what if it
[1:42:16] have blowned up the meeting what if
[1:42:17] brother Randon would have got in himself
[1:42:19] what if he would have accepted the
[1:42:21] provocation
[1:42:23] where Billy Paul was Billy Paul speaking
[1:42:25] at that moment has a son of God or as a
[1:42:29] son of William Mariam brandham he was
[1:42:32] speaking as a son of William Mary and
[1:42:33] brandom just as Jesus had to discern how
[1:42:37] Peter was speaking in that moment there
[1:42:39] comes a discernment Lord let me not get
[1:42:41] caught in the wrong Channel amen and
[1:42:44] then that man shows up in Jeffersonville
[1:42:46] within the next week and they're getting
[1:42:48] ready to sit down for
[1:42:50] dinner calls brother brandom on the
[1:42:52] phone but the said brother you're in
[1:42:54] town come on over for dinner we're
[1:42:56] getting ready and by the way are you
[1:42:57] going to be here on Wednesday night I'd
[1:42:59] like you to preach for us oh come on wow
[1:43:03] now this is from Brother George Smith
[1:43:05] and countless sources can you imagine
[1:43:07] well you can brother George said the
[1:43:09] gasp at the dinner
[1:43:13] table he did that to my daddy he did
[1:43:17] that you're going to invite him to come
[1:43:19] sit
[1:43:20] here after he did that to you
[1:43:25] oh Lord you see what I'm saying in with
[1:43:28] this right here is this to me as an
[1:43:30] example that God has called us to amen
[1:43:33] the what I've Got Confidence is the same
[1:43:35] quality of the holy spirit in him what
[1:43:38] it did in him it'll produce the same way
[1:43:40] in The Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:43:42] called to be a prophet neither are you
[1:43:44] but I am called to be a believer I am
[1:43:47] called to be a testimony you might not
[1:43:49] be called to preach but you're called to
[1:43:50] live and preach the word of God through
[1:43:52] your life you and I are all called to be
[1:43:55] an expression of this
[1:43:58] word let me try to find somewhere
[1:44:03] here notice in verse five but now it's
[1:44:07] come upon thee and thou faintest so in
[1:44:11] other words after job's been such a a
[1:44:13] channel for strength and now what's
[1:44:15] happening to you and you're
[1:44:17] fainting let me just say this if we
[1:44:19] could say this to Bill dad in life has
[1:44:21] he's not Superman
[1:44:25] and if you can accept it in this way
[1:44:27] their lack of understanding of the
[1:44:30] goodness of God they looked at the
[1:44:32] blessings of God as though the blessings
[1:44:34] of God everything is perfect and when
[1:44:37] Cloudy Skies oh God's angry at you well
[1:44:41] brother Bram had to sort through that in
[1:44:43] the Tabernacle when his eye was almost
[1:44:45] blown out with the shotgun brother
[1:44:46] brandham got in or with that with that
[1:44:48] rifle brother Bram got in a car accident
[1:44:49] and there was that circulating around
[1:44:51] the Tabernacle oh there must be some
[1:44:53] something in brother Neville's life
[1:44:54] there must be something in brother
[1:44:55] bram's life those things were
[1:44:57] circulating around there but listen to
[1:44:58] me God would take job's
[1:45:02] life and through his life he would
[1:45:05] actually teach them the grace of God in
[1:45:11] Trials God said this is better than a
[1:45:13] book it's better than just giving you a
[1:45:16] tape how about I let my servant job live
[1:45:20] a sermon Hallelujah cuz remember the end
[1:45:23] of this trial job had to pray for his
[1:45:28] friends they had to come and present a
[1:45:31] lamb he prayed God the final conclusion
[1:45:34] of his trial is where he would be able
[1:45:37] to actually pray for them with the right
[1:45:42] feeling and the right spirit
[1:45:58] let me read this scripture can I read
[1:46:00] just a few scriptures to
[1:46:03] you this is what we want to be guilty
[1:46:07] of it's lifting up one another amen
[1:46:11] everything we do Paul says is to edify
[1:46:14] right the
[1:46:16] body even the words and the things that
[1:46:18] we would
[1:46:19] speak
[1:46:21] right but Sam what is saying you just
[1:46:23] don't want to walk away from something
[1:46:25] and say well I told the truth right I
[1:46:27] gave them the
[1:46:31] word but what's important is you could
[1:46:34] give them the word but not give them the
[1:46:37] spirit of the
[1:46:38] word if you don't give them the spirit
[1:46:40] of the word you
[1:46:44] failed that's where we that's where we
[1:46:46] need the discernment because it isn't
[1:46:48] the word the
[1:46:49] letter the letter kth it's the spirit
[1:46:53] that giveth
[1:46:54] life is that right can I have these few
[1:46:59] moments we want to be guilty of lifting
[1:47:02] up that don't mean just patent I'm not
[1:47:04] talking about patent sin on the back but
[1:47:05] I don't think I should have to say that
[1:47:08] finally be ye all of One mind having
[1:47:11] compassion one of another love as
[1:47:16] Brethren be pitiful be courteous that
[1:47:20] word pitiful means having a strong
[1:47:22] compass passion being tenderhearted as
[1:47:26] Paul said be kind to one another be
[1:47:31] tenderhearted friends I listen we're
[1:47:33] living in an age it's an age of
[1:47:38] hardness the Bible speaks of this age
[1:47:40] that it's without natural affection that
[1:47:44] is so true it's gone away truth Breakers
[1:47:47] somebody tell you one thing I'll be
[1:47:49] there it's nothing to break it no every
[1:47:51] people's words means nothing
[1:47:54] that's the spirit it's not the people
[1:47:56] it's the spirit of this
[1:47:58] age things has been sold all the way
[1:48:01] down through time it isn't just
[1:48:03] something that's come up overnight it's
[1:48:06] the crop of the hour that's been
[1:48:10] SED that is so good
[1:48:14] notice Paul would say for ye had
[1:48:18] compassion of me in my bonds
[1:48:24] this is what we want to have and I
[1:48:26] sometimes the bonds Paul writes of these
[1:48:27] bonds right here where they were
[1:48:30] giving financially they were giving of
[1:48:33] themselves there was needs that he had
[1:48:35] certain cares and Paul wrote of that but
[1:48:38] sometimes the bonds are not that
[1:48:41] simple sometimes the bonds are much
[1:48:43] deeper and I'm not saying that every one
[1:48:44] of us are qualified to go speak to
[1:48:46] somebody else and things like that some
[1:48:48] of those things right there is true God
[1:48:49] works right through and and by the
[1:48:51] ministry but let me just say this is if
[1:48:53] you'll just put in your part and say
[1:48:56] Lord here's my
[1:48:59] hands here's my feet Here I Am Lord like
[1:49:03] the sister saying tonight I want him to
[1:49:05] have all of me I I I I want to just be
[1:49:08] an instrument I want to just be a
[1:49:09] channel I want to just be a vessel Lord
[1:49:12] how you want to use
[1:49:18] me how many know he's a high priest
[1:49:21] that's touched am by the feeling of our
[1:49:25] infirmities then let me tell you you and
[1:49:27] I part of that body then let me tell you
[1:49:30] sometimes the ways and how he is touched
[1:49:32] it'll move through us and he will
[1:49:34] operate through our hands right he'll
[1:49:36] operate through our feet sure he'll
[1:49:38] operate through our
[1:49:40] lives it's not something you have to
[1:49:42] force or I have to force it isn't it
[1:49:44] isn't something that we're going out of
[1:49:46] here tonight and saying I am going to
[1:49:48] get the church registry and I'm going to
[1:49:50] text everybody on there that maybe that
[1:49:51] wouldn't be a good it maybe that
[1:49:52] wouldn't be a good it wouldn't be a bad
[1:49:54] thing forgive me it wouldn't be a bad
[1:49:57] thing but rather if we would come from
[1:50:00] way away from this here tonight in this
[1:50:01] part of it and say Lord help me to be
[1:50:04] more
[1:50:06] sensitive because who knows it might be
[1:50:09] the word that God has given you
[1:50:11] something that can actually minister to
[1:50:14] that brother or
[1:50:15] sister and you know what what it ends up
[1:50:17] being is how all of a sudden they'll get
[1:50:19] this text in the middle of the time or
[1:50:22] something or or a card or something that
[1:50:24] comes their way or just even a phone
[1:50:26] call say brother I'm praying for you
[1:50:27] Lord I I've got you on my heart Oh
[1:50:29] Brother s I'm so weary I'm so tired but
[1:50:31] if we go that extra mile if God's
[1:50:33] putting it on our
[1:50:35] heart then surely he's not leading us
[1:50:38] wrong brother I don't need to know what
[1:50:40] you're going through but I know this God
[1:50:42] knows just know you got somebody praying
[1:50:44] for you or standing right here in the
[1:50:46] corner for you that that's that's it
[1:50:49] that's the
[1:50:51] truth but but BR said it like this he
[1:50:53] says I like a good warm feeling don't
[1:50:55] you he's talking about how we shake one
[1:50:57] another's hand and embrace one another
[1:50:59] he said I hate that that old cold formal
[1:51:02] way we got people today they're so far
[1:51:04] away from one another you don't even
[1:51:05] care for one another that's what's the
[1:51:07] matter even church members get the same
[1:51:09] way they don't care for one another why
[1:51:11] if anybody does wrong trying to shove
[1:51:13] him down don't shove him down pick him
[1:51:16] up help him don't try to criticize him
[1:51:20] and tell somebody else go to him with
[1:51:22] your arms around him and today they're
[1:51:25] so afraid they don't even want to shake
[1:51:26] hands anymore just so you understand
[1:51:29] brother Brandon believed this so much
[1:51:30] that he quotes this multiple times
[1:51:33] they're going down the street and here
[1:51:35] stands a lady that says hello sister
[1:51:38] brandham hello sister brandom and
[1:51:40] brother Bram looks around and he says
[1:51:43] mey he said that woman over there she
[1:51:45] said she she said hi to you she said
[1:51:48] well I smiled he said
[1:51:51] smiled I'm just quoting and as he quoted
[1:51:53] in multiple messages he said that's not
[1:51:56] the way to do it don't just Nodge your
[1:51:58] head at her but greet that
[1:52:02] sister he wasn't just preaching to the
[1:52:05] congregation there at Jeffersonville it
[1:52:07] was an expression coming back now indeed
[1:52:10] that might have been just how sister mey
[1:52:12] was maybe there were things of life that
[1:52:16] was just kind of picked up but aren't
[1:52:19] you glad that God comes around and gives
[1:52:20] us Grace and says you know what a good
[1:52:23] old pump handle handshake is a right
[1:52:25] thing to
[1:52:27] [Applause]
[1:52:30] do yes
[1:52:32] [Applause]
[1:52:33] sir I'll stop
[1:52:36] here no matter how poor we are how we
[1:52:39] have to be run over how the world talks
[1:52:41] about you says anything about you it
[1:52:43] ought to make you keep your head up for
[1:52:44] the Morales of the rest of them we
[1:52:46] should never have words against one
[1:52:48] another we should always say the highest
[1:52:51] thing about about a brother or sister
[1:52:54] true you now it's not about them
[1:52:56] deserving it but it's always saying the
[1:52:59] highest thing about them
[1:53:02] right if one is down in the
[1:53:05] gutter don't never shove them any
[1:53:07] further down pick him up get him up out
[1:53:11] of there as quick as you
[1:53:14] can because it
[1:53:18] helps we should be an example we should
[1:53:21] live an example like we are Sons and
[1:53:23] Daughters of God the Eternal King we
[1:53:25] ought to conduct ourselves in that
[1:53:28] manner as Sons and Daughters of the king
[1:53:30] we should never do anything that would
[1:53:33] bring a
[1:53:40] disgrace let me just leave you on this
[1:53:43] slide I
[1:53:46] am My Brother's
[1:53:48] Keeper that is so good I am My Brother's
[1:53:51] Keeper
[1:53:54] what God would lay and place upon my
[1:53:56] heart what God places on your heart as
[1:53:59] you would stand and pray for that
[1:54:02] brother or that sister sometimes listen
[1:54:04] friends I understand that sometimes it's
[1:54:06] not about texting or calling but I think
[1:54:08] sometimes that we let those things go so
[1:54:10] much and we can become so occupied with
[1:54:14] the things of life that we just kind of
[1:54:15] brow that blow that off and you say well
[1:54:17] praying for him is the most important
[1:54:19] thing I agree I agree praying for him is
[1:54:22] the most most important thing but that
[1:54:24] little bit of showing
[1:54:25] compassion like job did job didn't only
[1:54:28] pray for the people he instructed many
[1:54:32] Lord he strengthened those who were
[1:54:34] feeble those who maybe were discouraged
[1:54:38] those that were down he just encouraged
[1:54:40] them maybe he didn't have to go through
[1:54:42] there and you say well job was a prophet
[1:54:43] I I don't believe that job always went
[1:54:45] and preached them a
[1:54:47] sermon maybe sometimes job just listened
[1:54:50] and would just remind him of the
[1:54:52] goodness of
[1:54:54] God sometimes just to be able to reflect
[1:54:57] on where God has brought you from what
[1:54:59] God has done in your life and how God
[1:55:02] will see you through can be of the
[1:55:05] greatest help to the rest of the body I
[1:55:09] don't know about you but this this right
[1:55:11] here tonight it strikes my heart I want
[1:55:14] to be a
[1:55:15] help I want to be more of a help I want
[1:55:18] to be more of a help if there's one
[1:55:20] thing at all I want to be more Cent
[1:55:22] sensitive I want to be more sensitive in
[1:55:25] the place friends that you might
[1:55:26] understand that even though sometimes
[1:55:28] there's things I can't get into it
[1:55:30] tonight but as we would look at it
[1:55:32] sometimes on the surface and we think
[1:55:33] this is this is what's wrong this is
[1:55:36] what's wrong and what we see on the
[1:55:37] surface is not what's
[1:55:40] wrong that's so true you can get
[1:55:43] everything corrected on the surface and
[1:55:45] everything beneath the surface be
[1:55:48] wrong remember the biggest part of the
[1:55:50] iceberg that the T sunk the Titanic was
[1:55:53] not what was on top of the water
[1:55:56] invisible it was what was beneath the
[1:56:00] water what was beneath the water cut the
[1:56:04] Hall of the ship where nobody could see
[1:56:08] the gash in there and the water pouring
[1:56:12] into the ship because it was beneath the
[1:56:15] surface I say God help
[1:56:18] us to be
[1:56:20] sensitive help us to be like the minute
[1:56:23] men were in the revolution help us to be
[1:56:26] sensitive if it's somebody comes to your
[1:56:28] heart in the middle of the night there
[1:56:30] many times like this friend sometimes it
[1:56:32] might be that where I I'll get up and
[1:56:33] I'll I'll pray sometimes it's simply was
[1:56:35] brought to me and trying to even get out
[1:56:37] of the sleep I'll say Lord remember
[1:56:39] brother so and so Lord and roll back
[1:56:42] over and go right back to sleep remember
[1:56:45] sister so and so Lord Lord remember this
[1:56:47] family Lord God
[1:56:49] Amen God knows what he's doing friends
[1:56:52] he sure does I trust tonight that as
[1:56:55] we've looked at some of this and looking
[1:56:57] at this tonight if we can just even
[1:56:59] allow the spirit of God to say Lord I'm
[1:57:02] not going to underestimate what you've
[1:57:04] called me to do I'm not going to I I
[1:57:06] help me to be a
[1:57:08] channel I may not be able to be like so
[1:57:10] and so God don't want you to be like so
[1:57:12] and so some people like brother Bram
[1:57:14] says are so gifted to testify some are
[1:57:16] in this way some are in that way but it
[1:57:18] doesn't matter I we don't have to be
[1:57:19] like nobody else just be sensitive to
[1:57:21] what God has you to
[1:57:23] because as you're an instrument and I'm
[1:57:25] an instrument then we can help one
[1:57:26] another as a body I say oh God May the
[1:57:30] Holy Spirit just continue to minister so
[1:57:33] deep in Our Lives May the word of God
[1:57:35] Lord guide us from the songs that are
[1:57:37] sung from the words that are that are
[1:57:39] mentioned from even to encourage
[1:57:41] somebody when they first come in that
[1:57:43] door you may not have seen them for
[1:57:45] months but if there's anything that
[1:57:47] should be the greatest help is to
[1:57:49] encourage him and say brother or sister
[1:57:51] it's good to see you so good to see you
[1:57:55] in the house of the
[1:57:58] Lord don't greet him and say
[1:58:01] stranger how are you
[1:58:03] doing you might as well have slapped
[1:58:05] them in the face spit in their
[1:58:10] face but you ought to be thankful that's
[1:58:13] what we've been praying
[1:58:14] about is that right that's what we've
[1:58:17] been praying about if there's anything
[1:58:18] at all we want to be an encouragement to
[1:58:20] one another because listen friends you
[1:58:22] don't know sometimes what's going down
[1:58:26] beneath the
[1:58:29] surface so I say Lord You're the answer
[1:58:33] not me just help me to be sensitive Lord
[1:58:37] is that your prayer that's what I want
[1:58:39] tonight just a real fresh consecration
[1:58:41] to
[1:58:42] him when this question is asked how hast
[1:58:45] thou helped how how did you minister to
[1:58:47] me Samuel when I was in prison did you
[1:58:50] come to me when I was thirsty did you
[1:58:53] give me
[1:58:54] drink Samuel when I was sick did you
[1:58:57] visit me when I needed ministering
[1:59:01] to did you minister to
[1:59:04] me God help
[1:59:06] us help
[1:59:09] us help us let's pray praise
[1:59:13] God
[1:59:15] hallelujah bless anybody else want to be
[1:59:18] remembered in prayer with me I'm just
[1:59:21] going to lift up for the lord lord and
[1:59:22] remember me God bless your hands I want
[1:59:26] both of my hands are up Lord help me
[1:59:30] Lord maybe as the musicians would come
[1:59:32] and play something
[1:59:35] softly heavenly
[1:59:39] father I realize Lord when I read Lord
[1:59:42] through
[1:59:43] this these things Lord that even as your
[1:59:46] Prophet would speak of it Lord that the
[1:59:49] feeling seems like it's lifting from one
[1:59:51] another
[1:59:53] now Lord it's not anything Lord that
[1:59:56] would ever be intentional Lord on our
[1:59:59] part but father sometimes through the
[2:00:02] cares of
[2:00:04] life we can Lord get
[2:00:08] away from Lord that place of really
[2:00:11] being
[2:00:12] sensitive sometimes Lord we we can
[2:00:15] become
[2:00:16] intimidated by our own
[2:00:20] weaknesses but father
[2:00:23] father May the burden that you place on
[2:00:27] our
[2:00:28] heart may that be Lord so much
[2:00:32] greater than any weakness Lord that we
[2:00:35] would
[2:00:36] have so many times Lord that that's how
[2:00:39] Satan would want to hold us
[2:00:42] back but Lord we're called to minister
[2:00:46] to one another right here in this
[2:00:49] assembly Lord yeah
[2:00:53] we're called as a body to minister to
[2:00:55] one another there's different ones Lord
[2:00:58] that father I I'm so thankful that
[2:01:01] throughout this
[2:01:02] assembly hearts Lord that would be moved
[2:01:06] by your
[2:01:08] spirit Lord that would call one
[2:01:10] another's names out in
[2:01:13] prayer they would send a text maybe a
[2:01:16] card maybe they would just greet the
[2:01:18] brother or sister and say I'm praying
[2:01:20] for you I want you to know I I love you
[2:01:23] I want you to know I love you I
[2:01:24] appreciate you Lord sometimes it isn't
[2:01:28] it isn't everything Lord of the amount
[2:01:29] of words that we would say it's
[2:01:32] sometimes Lord just the
[2:01:34] simpleness of just being yielded in
[2:01:37] Simplicity
[2:01:38] Lord I pray tonight Lord that as we lord
[2:01:42] would reflect I Lord right here in my
[2:01:44] heart you

[2:02:24] minister certain things Lord whether it
[2:02:26] be here or other places Lord sometimes
[2:02:29] it's been things on the spare of the
[2:02:31] moment
[2:02:32] Lord but father I don't only want to be
[2:02:35] sensitive to minister in that way I want
[2:02:39] to be sensitive Lord when I'm maybe Lord

[2:19:18] ft the devil said you you know you
[2:19:21] didn't do
[2:19:23] enough you know he said you didn't do
[2:19:26] enough you should have kept
[2:19:28] on and you could have said this and you
[2:19:31] could have said
[2:19:33] that but you have to have that
[2:19:36] discernment to
[2:19:38] know I I said
[2:19:40] Lord I says I did what you wanted me to
[2:19:44] do and say what you wanted me to say and
[2:19:48] I pray that you would reach out to must
[2:19:51] mother and touch her and comfort her and
[2:19:54] conso her in her time of stress and her
[2:19:59] de you know loneliness Lord touch her
[2:20:04] Lord and touch this one that I've
[2:20:06] witness to
[2:20:10] again and you
[2:20:12] know the devil said he ain't going to
[2:20:14] come to church he said he would today
[2:20:17] but he's not going to be there you know
[2:20:20] he ain't going to be there and when I
[2:20:23] came he's not here he said he was going
[2:20:26] to come you
[2:20:28] know but I did what God wanted me to do
[2:20:33] see and we can't go down through that
[2:20:35] channel and say well yeah where is he
[2:20:38] you know God know where is he
[2:20:41] at because God put it in my heart to go
[2:20:44] there just to go to Home Depot when when
[2:20:48] I left sister Iman I said to Sister Iman
[2:20:50] I
[2:20:51] says I only came here to testify and I'm
[2:20:55] turning around and leaving so God bless
[2:20:59] you I just thought that this was timely
[2:21:02] with the
[2:21:03] message you know uh being having that
[2:21:07] discernment to know what you what to say
[2:21:11] and what not to say and don't be anxious
[2:21:15] for anything but just trusting in God
[2:21:19] because God knows where they are at God
[2:21:22] knows how to comfort I just did what
[2:21:26] what he told me to do this
[2:21:28] morning and uh he said you have to go at
[2:21:32] 2:30 you have to go now you have to be
[2:21:35] there you have to go there and you know
[2:21:37] what when he was
[2:21:39] coming the young man when he was coming
[2:21:43] he was just leaving to go
[2:21:46] home if that's not Timely
[2:21:51] God bless you God bless
[2:21:57] you I say it to you like this you know
[2:22:00] that you can you can when you hear the
[2:22:03] testimonies and things just just to be
[2:22:05] mindful in this right here God speaks to
[2:22:08] us in so many different ways and he'll
[2:22:11] speak to us how he speaks to us that's
[2:22:14] right you know there's certain ways that
[2:22:16] God will speak to you or he'll speak to
[2:22:18] me that he may not speak to somebody
[2:22:19] else is as far as in that exact way but
[2:22:22] God does speak yes he does sometimes
[2:22:24] it's just it's just a a pulsation that
[2:22:27] God would just move on our heart at that
[2:22:29] moment and just to be obedient to it I
[2:22:32] remember one time I was walking I was as
[2:22:34] I go out and walk at Lake View Park and
[2:22:35] I kept making these passes and the Holy
[2:22:37] Spirit directed me back here to this
[2:22:40] young lady that was sitting there praise
[2:22:41] the Lord it was a young young black lady
[2:22:43] she was sitting there and she was
[2:22:44] reading out there in the in the reading
[2:22:46] in the middle and I I walked over and I
[2:22:48] just thought well no I'm not going to
[2:22:49] there was all people all around and I so
[2:22:51] then I begin to talk to her we just
[2:22:53] started to talk and I begin to just
[2:22:54] speak about just the things of God just
[2:22:57] to witness about the things of the Lord
[2:22:59] and and just begin to testify to her now
[2:23:02] she never ever came here but she does
[2:23:04] know where the church is at and we begin
[2:23:07] to just just begin to witness to her I'm
[2:23:08] not trying to pull nobody here but I
[2:23:10] just wanted to know that God God cares
[2:23:13] about you and I've walked by you I don't
[2:23:15] know how many times and the Lord told me
[2:23:16] about the first lap around I should have
[2:23:18] stopped but I ignored him and I went on
[2:23:20] think it was my mind sure I said so this
[2:23:23] is why I'm here right now because he
[2:23:24] told
[2:23:25] me but I doesn't want that out there I
[2:23:28] want that right here in the body right
[2:23:30] right right here in the body amen amen
[2:23:33] God bless you tonight you have a
[2:23:35] testimony okay praise God praise the
[2:23:40] Lord praise the Lord Saints I I have
[2:23:44] said
[2:23:45] I well before I left South Carolina I
[2:23:49] had told the Lord I said well God I said
[2:23:51] I I'm going to if they ask me for a
[2:23:54] testimony I'm going testify but tonight
[2:23:56] I was supposed to get here and enough
[2:23:58] time to sh share with you all the
[2:24:01] testimony of what God is doing in my
[2:24:04] life in South Carolina um I had promised
[2:24:07] him I was going to do that but I didn't
[2:24:09] get here early enough but I said at the
[2:24:11] end I had said well Lord if you want me
[2:24:14] to get the testimony let him ask for
[2:24:16] testimonies and since the brother was up
[2:24:18] here testifying
[2:24:20] I said I can't go back to South
[2:24:22] Carolina without giving this testimony
[2:24:26] because when God is doing the
[2:24:28] supernatural the more you testify God to
[2:24:31] do more and that's what I want to happen
[2:24:35] I don't have the pictures I didn't get
[2:24:37] here early enough to show to share with
[2:24:39] you all the picture the two pictures but
[2:24:42] anyways um to make a long story short my
[2:24:45] brother on August 8th um just maybe two
[2:24:49] months ago my brother um he
[2:24:53] was basically we couldn't find him
[2:24:57] nobody had heard from him for like three
[2:25:00] days they found we found him on the
[2:25:02] floor in his apartment it had been 4
[2:25:05] days he was on the floor nonresponsive B
[2:25:08] barely clinging to
[2:25:10] life and so when EMS got there and
[2:25:13] everything basically he was barely
[2:25:16] breathing and um turns out he had a
[2:25:20] stroke he had a really bad hemorrhagic
[2:25:22] stroke on the brain and by the time they
[2:25:26] got him to the hospital um the
[2:25:29] doctors I mean we entrusted in them you
[2:25:32] know you go to the hospital and you're
[2:25:34] like okay man can help me at this point
[2:25:38] so they got him there and tried to bring
[2:25:40] his blood pressure down and they messed
[2:25:42] up my sister is a medical doctor and she
[2:25:46] will tell you when you have a stroke you
[2:25:48] can't just bring the person's blood
[2:25:49] pressure down like you know immediately
[2:25:52] it has to be gradually so they messed
[2:25:55] that up and he ended up having a second
[2:25:57] stroke so here he is basically fighting
[2:26:01] for his life having two strokes he's on
[2:26:04] life support he got all of the tubes
[2:26:06] coming out
[2:26:08] everywhere and so you know I to I I was
[2:26:12] just like Lord you know the doctor said
[2:26:15] even if he survives he'll be a vegetable
[2:26:18] The Impossible
[2:26:20] and I was just like Lord you know I had
[2:26:23] told my family I always testified to
[2:26:26] them when God speaks to me and I felt
[2:26:28] like it was for them I told them maybe
[2:26:31] two week two two months before it
[2:26:33] happened I said y'all the Lord spoke to
[2:26:35] me and said the death angel was coming
[2:26:38] and for you all to get sin out of your
[2:26:40] life because the Death Angel is coming
[2:26:42] and get up under the blood I don't know
[2:26:45] why he spoke to me and told me that and
[2:26:47] then this happened with my brother so so
[2:26:51] I was like okay when I was I went to his
[2:26:54] room and I prayed for two hours straight
[2:26:57] in his ear I said Lord I said hearing is
[2:27:00] the last thing for to go before a person
[2:27:03] dies but my prayer was like God if you
[2:27:07] you know if this is the Fulfillment of
[2:27:09] what you were saying don't let my
[2:27:10] brother suffer but I was like please
[2:27:13] just take him but I don't know what the
[2:27:16] will of God is in this situation so I
[2:27:19] just prayed like I I mean I prayed for
[2:27:21] life I was like Lord I don't know what
[2:27:23] your will is but let me pray I prayed 2
[2:27:26] hours straight and I couldn't get up the
[2:27:28] next morning he just lay there he was in
[2:27:30] a coma nonresponsive there was nothing
[2:27:35] and I went home I said y'all I need a
[2:27:37] word from God I stayed after
[2:27:40] church um and we had a miracle service
[2:27:44] and I said Lord if the spirit of God you
[2:27:47] know the spirit of Miracles was there
[2:27:49] I'm I was like God I don't know if it's
[2:27:51] for you to take him but I said let me
[2:27:54] know something and the the man of God
[2:27:57] said he shall live and not die for the
[2:28:00] glory of God and I just held on to that
[2:28:03] I said God I believe you want to do a
[2:28:05] miracle prise so I stopped I said look
[2:28:09] family I said y'all just leave me alone
[2:28:11] I mean this has been going on so he
[2:28:14] stayed in the coma for a whole month
[2:28:16] Saints a whole month wow and I was
[2:28:19] wrestling with the angel I said look I
[2:28:21] got to pray and get a breakthrough I'm
[2:28:23] not talking about no pretty prayer I'm
[2:28:25] talking about agonizing before God until
[2:28:28] he answers back and one of the services
[2:28:32] God came down and it was like a miracle
[2:28:36] I said okay this is it this is it I said
[2:28:40] God I want you to go to the hospital and
[2:28:43] I want you to bring his Spirit back cuz
[2:28:45] he's
[2:28:47] gone and the Lord Vindicated that he had
[2:28:51] answered my prayer the next morning he
[2:28:55] had been in a coma for a whole month the
[2:28:57] next morning when my brother my other
[2:28:59] brother went in there said Paul was
[2:29:02] awake he was responding he was up
[2:29:06] watching
[2:29:08] television this is how God works you
[2:29:13] know the
[2:29:17] impossible so after everybody had shook
[2:29:20] their head and said nothing could be
[2:29:22] done he bought my my brother out of that
[2:29:25] coma and and just you know when you come
[2:29:28] out of a coma you know it's not like you
[2:29:31] know everybody says well okay my sister
[2:29:34] was like okay he's going to be depressed
[2:29:36] he could have problems with depression
[2:29:38] and this so he cried for a little while
[2:29:40] but then the depression left and
[2:29:43] everything and I just appreciate God
[2:29:46] because now to this day he took they
[2:29:49] took him and put him in rehab the left
[2:29:52] side of his body was still paralyzed and
[2:29:56] I told him I said look family I said I'm
[2:29:59] asking God to do another miracle for my
[2:30:01] brother if he raised him from the dead I
[2:30:05] know he can move the paralysis
[2:30:08] Hallelujah so just before I came that's
[2:30:11] why I said I'm testifying now before I
[2:30:14] came they said that they were going to
[2:30:16] have to move him to a nursing home
[2:30:18] Saints because he could he had that
[2:30:21] paralysis in the left side of his body
[2:30:23] but before I came he was
[2:30:27] walking
[2:30:32] walking and I and I just I just praise
[2:30:36] God because y'all I we before God and I
[2:30:39] praise

[2:30:43] just praising God because he is I told I
[2:30:47] told my brothers and sisters I said my
[2:30:49] brother is going to walk out of that
[2:30:51] rehab place and I said y'all trying to
[2:30:54] say he going to go to a nursing home
[2:30:56] he's walking out of there because the
[2:30:59] God that I serve is able okay and and
[2:31:04] and he is and I just said I I said when
[2:31:07] I go to Ohio I said I'm going to
[2:31:10] testify because when God is doing the
[2:31:13] supernal we got to testify and so I just
