[30:36] what a wonderful reality
[30:39] safe in the haven of rest
[30:43] so
[30:44] so precious to us
[30:47] man more and more each passing moment
[30:52] we just as we prepare to turn our hearts
[30:56] to the word of the lord tonight
[30:59] uh
[31:01] we want to continue to remember the
[31:04] walker family
[31:05] prayer
[31:07] god would just continue to minister to
[31:09] them and all the extended
[31:11] family
[31:12] all that are around
[31:14] and
[31:14] that god would just comfort them
[31:18] and
[31:21] i just say it in this way when we were
[31:26] on our way home when i
[31:27] received
[31:29] the news and we could get everything
[31:31] rounded up and on our way home there on
[31:33] monday
[31:35] i want to say thank you for your prayers
[31:37] for the services there
[31:40] the lord just
[31:42] the lord had his way
[31:44] and we just thank god for that
[31:46] and so i want to just give you the
[31:48] greetings from there and also to say
[31:51] thank you for your prayers
[31:54] because we
[31:55] came home here on
[31:58] monday and just looking upon everything
[32:01] and with the family and
[32:05] just
[32:06] knowing that
[32:08] on our way home
[32:10] benjamin
[32:11] was listening
[32:13] to the service here
[32:15] from sunday
[32:18] you know god has he's so mindful
[32:22] and one of the clips
[32:25] that benjamin had he just
[32:27] he locked onto it and he began to play
[32:30] it in the car we must have played it two
[32:32] three times
[32:34] and it was a time where the lord just
[32:36] took brother brother nathan
[32:38] really dealt with the part of because
[32:40] you know they've been through some real
[32:42] tragedies there
[32:44] that of how that
[32:46] we don't always we don't understand
[32:49] when things take place
[32:52] and
[32:53] but just to see and just to hear the
[32:56] comfort of the holy spirit
[32:58] to give us a direction to know that in
[33:00] everything
[33:01] god's got a purpose
[33:04] prophet would take us into the word and
[33:06] let us know that
[33:08] god's not the author
[33:11] of frustration
[33:13] he's the author of peace
[33:16] and so when we begin to just
[33:19] think of those things and just to
[33:20] meditate on it there's no way that
[33:23] you know
[33:25] as a
[33:27] as an individual that we have
[33:29] we have answers for these things god has
[33:31] answers
[33:33] but we we know that
[33:35] we know that god's ways
[33:38] god's ways are perfect
[33:40] it's perfect
[33:42] so i just
[33:44] just just feeling led of the lord i'm
[33:46] just gonna take some different services
[33:48] and just to
[33:50] just to minister on certain things that
[33:52] the lord just pressing on my heart with
[33:55] certain things that are present also
[33:56] things that we
[33:57] look at
[33:59] and i just want to
[34:01] just we just want to give ourselves to
[34:03] him because if there's anything
[34:05] in the midst of this moment
[34:08] and every moment of our life
[34:11] he's our strength
[34:15] it doesn't matter
[34:17] what we face
[34:20] we can't face
[34:22] one day
[34:24] without him
[34:28] i don't care how good that i may feel i
[34:31] have it together you may feel you have
[34:32] it together
[34:34] i don't want to face it on my own
[34:38] no matter when i feel like i'm on the
[34:39] mountain or i feel like i'm in the
[34:41] valley or i feel like a situation in
[34:42] front of me that seems like everything's
[34:44] covered or when i don't
[34:46] we need him at all times
[34:52] david would write there in psalms 27 i
[34:54] think it's so fitting for the
[34:56] the hour that we're living in
[34:59] brother branham would be led to take
[35:01] that as a text for the rapture
[35:03] i'm sure that probably like even most of
[35:05] us
[35:06] at first
[35:07] would wonder
[35:08] why didn't why didn't the prophet take
[35:10] first thessalonians 4 for the text
[35:14] why didn't he take first corinthians 15.
[35:17] but when brother branham reads psalms 27
[35:21] he says i'm going to give a background
[35:26] for this setting of the rapture
[35:28] i think how david opens in that first
[35:30] part the lord
[35:32] is the strength of my life
[35:35] you know that's the real height
[35:38] we we
[35:39] we speak of the capstone coming down
[35:42] and the mind of christ has set down
[35:44] upon the bride of jesus christ
[35:49] but to see that the
[35:51] the essence of that maturing in our life
[35:54] it brings
[35:55] god bringing us to the realization
[35:58] that he's the strength of our life
[36:02] that there's there's one holding me
[36:06] not me holding him
[36:10] and that's that's the that's the that's
[36:12] the that's the real
[36:14] climax of the maturity when
[36:18] we're being captured by that then god
[36:20] can work
[36:22] because he's the strength of my life
[36:27] we just want to remember the family in
[36:29] prayer
[36:34] i want to
[36:36] there'll be emails coming out i didn't
[36:37] want to send out the email the other
[36:39] night when we sent out that other one i
[36:41] just
[36:42] regarding arrangements but the
[36:44] arrangements will be on tuesday
[36:46] wednesday
[36:47] of next week
[36:49] and so we'll get those out to you
[36:52] tuesday will be the viewing wednesday

[37:01] with that we're going to put on for for
[37:04] their family
[37:05] friends there on wednesday so all those
[37:07] details will be coming out to you
[37:09] perhaps some of you already have those
[37:11] details but we'll be getting those out
[37:13] to you
[37:15] i also want to have a request have a
[37:17] request as we prepare to go into prayer
[37:20] i just heard received from brother
[37:22] alexander magoulas
[37:24] with alexander very very precious
[37:26] brother
[37:27] and you
[37:28] i called him very quickly when he was
[37:31] just coming out of prayer
[37:33] he
[37:34] had been having some he'd text me before
[37:36] he'd been having some things with that
[37:38] no with cardio or with the uh not cardio
[37:41] but with his uh
[37:43] thought might possibly be his heart and
[37:45] so forth
[37:46] and uh sure enough
[37:48] today his main artery was 99 blocked
[37:54] and they just put a stint in
[37:58] the other one they're going to do the
[37:59] other one on another day it's 70 percent
[38:04] and
[38:04] i told him i said brother brother
[38:06] alexander i said i know you know this i
[38:08] said but these are just things i'm
[38:09] pouring across right now i said the
[38:11] reality is
[38:13] god can't take you
[38:16] it can't be taken satan can't touch you
[38:20] until god's finished
[38:24] and just think of all of these things i
[38:26] you know i just we were just
[38:27] fellowshipping there on the phone of how
[38:29] that god
[38:30] helped us to be sensitive god allowed
[38:33] him to
[38:34] uh was about a year ago year and a half
[38:36] ago because brother jason watkins was
[38:38] actually in the same situation on a
[38:40] saturday evening
[38:42] he didn't want to go to the doctor and
[38:43] so forth and family pressured sure
[38:45] enough
[38:46] if brother jason hadn't win at that time
[38:48] brother jason watkins wouldn't have been
[38:50] with us
[38:51] same same thing
[38:53] brother alexander was just sharing that
[38:55] with me and so he's
[38:57] he's doing really well and he just was
[38:59] we were talking on the phone
[39:02] and uh
[39:03] so he just asked me to greet you
[39:05] and uh
[39:07] so he's doing really well and
[39:10] we just want to continue to remember him
[39:11] in prayer
[39:13] know truly it's a real comfort to know
[39:15] that our lives are in his hands
[39:18] it's in his hands
[39:20] everything god
[39:23] directing us influences even see when i
[39:25] look at that with brother jason and
[39:27] brother alexander being down there at
[39:29] that moment and being able to talk to
[39:31] brother jason
[39:32] that helped to alert
[39:34] brother alexander when he began to feel
[39:36] certain things preaching and he just
[39:38] felt like i can't i can't even get this
[39:40] thought out
[39:41] not able to mow his grass and things
[39:43] like that god allowed that and sometimes
[39:46] we
[39:46] we look at things and i'll say weak as i
[39:48] say i'm saying all of us and we don't
[39:50] realize
[39:52] the providential hand of almighty god
[39:55] that god is allowing things to be our
[39:57] paths to cross
[39:59] we're not here by accident we say that a
[40:01] lot but it's a truth
[40:03] it wasn't by accident that god allowed
[40:05] that to be heard
[40:08] by brother alexander from brother jason
[40:10] watkins because brother alexander shared
[40:12] with me says
[40:13] this as far as heart
[40:15] trouble runs on both sides of my family
[40:17] says and they've got family members that
[40:19] have died very young
[40:22] we thank god for his grace
[40:25] i just pray lord help us each and every
[40:28] one to just be more just just more
[40:30] yielded more sensitive and just
[40:32] because knowing that our lives you're
[40:34] directing our paths
[40:36] even when it's not even about our health
[40:38] it could be about a job it could be
[40:39] about god allows you to be in the
[40:41] certain places at the right time to hear
[40:43] the certain things we're we're i
[40:46] understand you we look at one another
[40:47] and we see one another as being yeah
[40:49] we're flesh but really what you see the
[40:51] flesh the flesh is only the screen
[40:55] that the attribute displays itself
[41:00] it's god moving an orchestra
[41:03] everything and i just
[41:05] gotta help us just to be that sensitive
[41:07] also sister linda cavill
[41:09] she
[41:10] she's there
[41:12] in the hospital they wanted to do some
[41:14] tests and you know she was
[41:15] they were concerned uh but yet it's what
[41:18] it is it's uh been a little bit of a
[41:20] reaction to a medication
[41:23] and that she's had and so there she's
[41:26] doing very well she's been doing well
[41:28] but with that little bit and then
[41:29] they're going to move her into uh from
[41:31] the hospital then to rehab and she's it
[41:33] just was just just
[41:35] speaking with her she's doing very well
[41:37] and so just ask that you would just
[41:39] continue remember her in prayer that god
[41:41] will just continue to give her strength
[41:43] amen and
[41:45] also brother bobby carper
[41:47] that would just continue to remember him
[41:49] in prayer forgive me if these are
[41:51] redundant if it's already been mentioned
[41:53] i didn't i just didn't hear it but
[41:55] brother bobby just remember the lord
[41:57] will just continue to give him strength
[41:59] he's
[42:00] he gets where brother bobby gets kind of
[42:03] blocked up and
[42:04] he just
[42:05] he needs he needs a touch from the lord
[42:08] it's it's this time has probably been
[42:10] the worst that's what he says he said
[42:12] it's the worst that he's ever been in
[42:14] so we just just want to ask the lord to
[42:17] continue to touch him because sister
[42:19] michelle's also you know coming through
[42:21] that of the knee surgery and she's been
[42:23] able to get around and things but we
[42:24] just want to remember them in prayer and
[42:27] i know there's many other needs in the
[42:29] body that are here in present so if we
[42:32] could let's just stand and let's go to
[42:34] the lord in a word of prayer before we
[42:35] turn to the word
[42:39] let's just pray together
[42:41] heavenly father

[45:57] amen and amen
[46:00] amen let's turn in their bibles to luke
[46:02] 24.
[46:05] i'm just going to just read here from a
[46:07] few verses of scripture we'll begin at
[46:09] verse 13.
[46:12] i know your place of reading
[46:17] say thank you musicians
[46:21] luke 24 verse 13.
[46:26] the bible says and behold two of them
[46:28] went that same day
[46:30] to a village called emmaus which was
[46:32] from jerusalem about three score
[46:34] furlings
[46:35] and they talked together of all these
[46:37] things which had happened
[46:40] and it came to pass that while they
[46:42] communed together
[46:44] and reasoned
[46:46] jesus himself drew near
[46:48] and went with him
[46:50] but their eyes were holding that they
[46:52] should not know him
[46:54] and he said unto them what manner of
[46:56] communications are these that you have
[46:58] one to another as you walk and are sad
[47:02] and the one of them whose name was
[47:04] colloquius
[47:06] answering said unto him art thou only a
[47:08] stranger in jerusalem and hast thou not
[47:11] known the things which are come to pass
[47:13] therein these days
[47:15] and he said unto them
[47:17] what things
[47:18] they said unto him concerning jesus of
[47:20] nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[47:23] indeed and word before god and all the
[47:25] people and how the chief priests and our
[47:28] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[47:30] death and have crucified him
[47:33] but we trusted that it had been he
[47:36] that should have redeemed israel
[47:39] beside all this today is the third day
[47:42] since these things were done
[47:44] yea and certain women also of our
[47:45] company made us astonished which were
[47:47] early at the sepulcher
[47:49] when they found not his body they came
[47:51] saying
[47:52] they had also seen a vision of angels
[47:55] which said that he was alive
[47:57] and certain of them which were with us
[47:59] went to the sepulchre and found it even
[48:00] so as the women had said
[48:03] they found but they saw him not then he
[48:06] said unto them o fools and soul of heart
[48:08] to believe all the prophets have spoken
[48:11] ought not christ to have suffered these
[48:13] things and to enter into his glory
[48:17] may god bless the reading of the word
[48:19] bless you as you're being seated
[48:23] i just
[48:24] i want to just speak just a few moments
[48:27] here this evening on a little
[48:31] thought on god's timing
[48:33] and purpose
[48:34] god's timing
[48:36] and purpose
[48:39] many times that we're looking at things
[48:41] that we know that in
[48:43] every promise that god has made in his
[48:45] word god an allotted time
[48:49] just like when it comes down to our own
[48:51] lives
[48:52] there's an allotted time
[48:55] and so when we
[48:57] recognize that that
[48:59] there's things that as we
[49:01] see within this passage of scripture
[49:04] that here the lord jesus is walking
[49:07] he comes and he draws near
[49:09] cleopas and the other disciple
[49:12] and they are they're communicating
[49:15] and they're sad
[49:17] regarding the situations that have just
[49:19] taken place
[49:21] they can't explain nor do they
[49:24] understand
[49:25] what has happened
[49:27] and but yet as they commune together and
[49:31] they reasoned
[49:32] within themselves now there's no doubt
[49:35] about it that what they were as they
[49:37] didn't understand that questions were
[49:39] there
[49:40] because it's evident by the scriptures
[49:42] but
[49:43] how that they could have been able to
[49:45] rehearse of just the
[49:47] the things that they had seen
[49:50] being done
[49:51] in the ministry of the lord jesus and
[49:53] they just
[49:55] trying to put all this together as we
[49:57] read in the scriptures we trusted that
[49:59] it had been he
[50:01] which should have redeemed israel
[50:03] and little did they know
[50:05] that's exactly what was taking place
[50:10] but
[50:10] when he came this is what's important
[50:14] is that
[50:15] he came and he drew near
[50:18] that's what made the difference
[50:21] when they were talking about all of this
[50:24] he came and he
[50:26] drew near that's
[50:28] that's what made all the difference in
[50:29] the world if he hadn't come to them
[50:33] there there never would have come forth
[50:37] any understanding within that present
[50:40] situation
[50:42] they would have been left brother
[50:43] branham re speaks of this we can see it
[50:46] in the scripture and how the spirit of
[50:48] god goes in to pull out the where that
[50:51] the people were at that moment they were
[50:53] in a state of bewilderment it was just
[50:56] as though that when things took place
[50:58] and how
[51:00] everything was a prophet mighty in word
[51:02] indeed they're witnessing him walking on
[51:05] the water they witnessed
[51:07] marvelous miraculous things being done
[51:09] that is not
[51:11] of of any earthly or human power but
[51:14] they knew it had to be almighty god
[51:18] and then to see
[51:20] something transpired that they
[51:22] themselves could not explain
[51:25] but yet in the midst of it and we
[51:27] understand that part with with the
[51:28] explaining and trying to understand
[51:30] because
[51:32] we as human beings we are always prone
[51:35] to seek for the why
[51:40] we're always
[51:42] sometimes we can become
[51:44] caught up with
[51:46] because our flesh always wants to escape
[51:48] at trial
[51:50] we always want to escape heartache or
[51:53] anything that would
[51:55] take away from us you know we look and
[51:56] say
[51:57] man if i would have done this i wouldn't
[51:59] have had that bill man if i'd have done
[52:01] this i we're always we're always looking
[52:03] to try to
[52:04] to escape that
[52:07] that's it doesn't matter where you you
[52:09] know in our lives of of being filled
[52:11] with the spirit of god there's still
[52:12] that flesh realm about it that the flesh
[52:14] realm does not want to
[52:16] suffer it doesn't want to do that
[52:20] and these are things that we we see
[52:22] within ourselves when we can still
[52:24] recognize in that part that this this
[52:26] this as jesus could say that the spirit
[52:29] is willing but the flesh is weak we are
[52:30] prone as human beings always to want to
[52:33] figure things out and sometimes we if we
[52:35] could have looked at things and i'm not
[52:36] saying sometimes things don't happen
[52:38] with choices and decisions but when you
[52:40] step back sometimes we look at things
[52:42] and we're trying to say well if we would
[52:44] have done this if so-and-so would have
[52:45] done this if we'd had done this and this
[52:47] wouldn't have happened and this wouldn't
[52:48] happen and listen let's just from from
[52:51] all from this back wall all the way
[52:52] clear that back wall and whatever covers
[52:55] on the internet we're all prone to that
[52:58] and we look at what could we have done
[52:59] to prevent it and sometimes there's
[53:01] there's just things that you realize
[53:04] that it wasn't something that we could
[53:06] prevent but god just gives us grace to
[53:10] go through it
[53:13] just no other way to explain that but
[53:15] there's still a part for us that we we
[53:17] seek to understand certain events this
[53:19] is what was taking place there to
[53:21] understand and we sometimes we're strive
[53:23] we perplexed to know why and yet you
[53:26] know this is something that we can all
[53:29] agree
[53:30] is that even in some situations that can
[53:33] be so
[53:34] tragic that even if we understood the
[53:37] why
[53:38] it would not remove the hurt
[53:43] you wouldn't
[53:47] i think right across here i just my mind
[53:49] begin to just i was just thinking
[53:51] throughout you know the course of um
[53:54] of the days here and just even on my way
[53:56] home and
[53:57] just looking at different things and i
[54:00] just
[54:00] you know i'm
[54:02] no doubt just like the rest of you just
[54:04] was in
[54:05] i was felt numb i was in a shock
[54:09] with everything and i'm just i'm just
[54:12] thinking and i'm reflecting
[54:14] uh upon so many different things that
[54:18] right here within of the assembly that
[54:21] sometimes we we could and i don't want
[54:23] to say that we forget but just sometimes
[54:25] when you step back and you begin to
[54:27] reflect on on this one and this tragic
[54:30] situation and this situation happened
[54:33] and this situation i mean i don't want
[54:34] to go into call events because some of
[54:37] you may not uh remember some of those
[54:39] events but where other young people have
[54:42] been other young ones that were very
[54:45] young that in a very tragic way things
[54:48] took place and things happened and i
[54:50] remember in those things because i had
[54:53] to do this i was also doing some of the
[54:55] funerals within those times
[54:57] and remembering that here in the in the
[54:59] assembly remembering working and
[55:01] ministering to different ones and i just
[55:04] you know when we look at everything the
[55:06] thing that we want in every situation
[55:08] we're looking to draw comfort
[55:11] from the lord
[55:13] because in everything
[55:16] that we can do there's a place where we
[55:18] can draw strength and we can draw
[55:20] comfort from him because
[55:23] though we would understand a situation
[55:26] and we don't it doesn't remove the hurt
[55:29] it doesn't remove the reality that we
[55:32] need his comfort
[55:34] we need his comfort when jesus when
[55:37] jesus through paul could speak and say
[55:41] that we mourn not as others mourn he
[55:44] never said that we don't mourn
[55:47] because paul said we weep with those who
[55:49] weep
[55:51] with though remembering them that are in
[55:52] bonds as you your suffering bonds
[55:54] remember them that are in adversity as
[55:57] yourself or in adversity paul is
[55:59] bringing it in that the body feels hurt
[56:02] when one hurts we all hurt
[56:04] when one rejoices we all rejoice
[56:08] we're not we've not been paralyzed
[56:11] we've not been numbed we is to be
[56:14] sensitive because god has placed it that
[56:17] way
[56:18] that there's a love and a care for one
[56:21] another
[56:24] to pray for one another and i know i
[56:26] know throughout this assembly we're in
[56:28] contact with different ones i've got on
[56:30] on on here i've got different threads
[56:31] where i'm in contact with different uh
[56:34] some some you know some pastors here and
[56:36] other mission threads here and other
[56:38] this and i've got all this and you're
[56:40] hearing the requests come in from
[56:42] nigeria you have a request come in from
[56:44] switzerland and it's all over the you
[56:47] know having different requests come in
[56:48] and you look at the requests sometimes
[56:50] and things that are coming but yet you
[56:53] don't know all those requests
[56:55] those are things that you know that
[56:56] might come to my attention but you know
[56:58] god has placed us here and it's not that
[57:01] we're not mindful of other needs we are
[57:03] and it will come to us as we lift it up
[57:06] in prayer but god has brought us
[57:08] together in a manner just like in your
[57:10] household that you're observant
[57:13] of the care and needs that's present
[57:15] sometimes there's things that are not
[57:17] even said but you're observant you just
[57:19] feel a burn you know maybe i just in
[57:21] this point right here to minister to my
[57:23] wife or to minister to my husband
[57:25] sometimes that part of ministry doesn't
[57:27] have anything to do with saying anything
[57:29] only being present and just saying lord
[57:32] just let me be an instrument
[57:37] if we understood everything and we knew
[57:40] everything
[57:41] then we wouldn't need faith
[57:44] but faith itself is the results of love
[57:48] and we trust him even when we don't
[57:49] understand
[57:52] that's difficult
[57:55] even for a believer born of the spirit
[57:57] of god let alone someone that's without
[57:59] the lord jesus
[58:01] it's not when i say difficult because
[58:03] our flesh our part is prone within that
[58:06] but there's something that rises within
[58:09] us
[58:11] that's greater than our humanity
[58:15] it's it's got to be there something
[58:17] that's greater than our humanity when
[58:19] brother banham stood there here his wife
[58:22] has been taken to the morgue now he
[58:24] stands there before his little daughter
[58:26] there had to be something brighter and
[58:28] greater than branham dna
[58:33] it's greater than that it's not it
[58:35] wasn't brand on dna that god had done it
[58:37] was the dna of almighty god that stood
[58:40] up in the meantime that when he said i
[58:42] was about ready to say but it rose up
[58:45] within him
[58:50] this is why job could say in the midst
[58:53] of his trying moment i just want you to
[58:55] these i know we we quote these words a
[58:57] lot but just just let him minister to us
[59:00] job said in job 13 15 though he slay me
[59:06] who's the part that was being slayed
[59:10] was it the attribute of god
[59:12] was it the gene of god that was being
[59:14] slayed
[59:15] no
[59:17] because if that's being slayed then you
[59:19] have god being slave
[59:22] though he slay me
[59:25] yet will i trust him so there's a me
[59:28] that is experiencing these things but
[59:31] there's an eye that rises in the midst
[59:34] of it and says i will trust him
[59:38] there's our flesh that experiences these
[59:41] things that where job had the loss and
[59:44] had the boils but there's a part that
[59:46] rises in the midst of a yay i will trust
[59:49] him because it's through that entrusting
[59:52] in him that brings
[59:54] stability and gives us to say god's got
[59:58] all of this and i'm gonna look to him
[1:00:05] what a testimony job said
[1:00:08] but i will
[1:00:10] maintain
[1:00:11] mine own ways
[1:00:13] before him
[1:00:16] psalm 62 verse 8
[1:00:19] trust in him
[1:00:21] at all times
[1:00:23] poor people poor you people pour out
[1:00:26] your heart before him god
[1:00:28] is a refuge
[1:00:30] for us
[1:00:32] trust in him at all times
[1:00:36] psalms 141 25 verse 1 just to share a
[1:00:40] few of these that just press on my heart
[1:00:42] they that trust in the lord
[1:00:45] shall be as mount zion
[1:00:47] which cannot be removed but abideth
[1:00:50] forever
[1:00:52] all of this we're speaking of it's not
[1:00:54] about oh brother
[1:00:56] you know if you if you really had it you
[1:00:58] wouldn't be weeping what
[1:01:01] what
[1:01:02] what are you talking about this is not
[1:01:04] glorified
[1:01:08] sometimes people can come with those
[1:01:10] types of things and then what happens is
[1:01:12] when they go through something
[1:01:15] well come on
[1:01:16] you see what i'm saying but we recognize
[1:01:18] this right here this flesh is weakness
[1:01:22] this is susceptible to get down when i'm
[1:01:25] talking about flesh you understand i'm
[1:01:27] talking about spirit and mind all of
[1:01:29] those things within it it's susceptible
[1:01:31] to all that that's why we have to battle
[1:01:33] through that
[1:01:35] is that right
[1:01:37] so it's not
[1:01:38] there's times we can get weary you can
[1:01:40] feel paul said when he was surrounded by
[1:01:43] things he said we had fears within
[1:01:47] and without
[1:01:51] so the part that's unmovable
[1:01:55] is that part that never you cannot
[1:01:59] change a believer from being a believer
[1:02:03] to an unbeliever
[1:02:05] because you've been made you have been
[1:02:07] ordained to believe and the spirit of
[1:02:10] god has raised you up and even though
[1:02:13] you can't i can't explain it and even
[1:02:16] though our surroundings might be
[1:02:18] shattered around us but it cannot cannot
[1:02:22] remove a believer from his god
[1:02:28] i say praise be to god for that
[1:02:32] and paul could say i'm persuaded
[1:02:35] he's able to keep that which i've
[1:02:37] committed unto him against that day
[1:02:40] hallelujah because we want to want to
[1:02:43] glory in
[1:02:44] in the lord because it's him it's not us
[1:02:47] they that trust in the lord shall be as
[1:02:49] mount zion which cannot be removed but
[1:02:50] abideth forever
[1:02:53] trust in the lord with
[1:02:55] all thine heart
[1:02:58] and lean not unto thine own
[1:03:00] understanding
[1:03:03] isaiah 26 3 i
[1:03:06] i love this scripture
[1:03:09] that will keep him in perfect peace
[1:03:12] whose mind is stayed on thee
[1:03:15] because he trusteth in thee
[1:03:17] trust ye in the lord forever for in the
[1:03:19] lord jehovah is everlasting strength let
[1:03:22] me just give you a little background
[1:03:25] this scripture
[1:03:26] ties into where we stand as the bride of
[1:03:28] jesus christ receiving
[1:03:31] the ministry here in the end time
[1:03:33] israel is to receive
[1:03:36] her visitation
[1:03:38] and these scriptures when they surround
[1:03:40] jerusalem these scriptures
[1:03:42] will be part of the manifestation that
[1:03:45] will be their strength
[1:03:47] when the armies are surrounding
[1:03:49] jerusalem and have come down there
[1:03:51] remember this is where this setting is
[1:03:53] in this scripture
[1:03:55] to see all of them that surround it now
[1:03:57] that's not the first time it's ever
[1:03:58] happened in israel that happened you
[1:04:00] remember in the time of uh cenerechev
[1:04:02] when he came down there
[1:04:04] but the point was is that god
[1:04:07] will have his word the holy spirit
[1:04:10] assembling his people and there
[1:04:12] will be those two
[1:04:14] witnesses that will stand there
[1:04:17] and those 144 will be baptized with the
[1:04:20] spirit of god brother samuel what he's
[1:04:22] saying i'm saying that it will be the
[1:04:24] thoughts of god that are present and
[1:04:27] being spoken in that hour that will
[1:04:30] override and give strength
[1:04:32] to all of the surrounding things david
[1:04:35] said though a host
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:38] which it wouldn't encompass about me
[1:04:39] it's the same setting
[1:04:42] we don't have natural army surrounding
[1:04:44] us but every demonic force is
[1:04:47] surrounding
[1:04:50] what is it that gives you an eye perfect
[1:04:52] peace
[1:04:54] what is it
[1:04:56] it's the lord jesus
[1:04:58] even as we come to the house of god and
[1:05:01] you're praying and you know our daily
[1:05:03] walk with god we are receiving strength
[1:05:05] from almighty god i'm grateful that
[1:05:08] there is help that we can receive from
[1:05:11] god from one through one another to
[1:05:14] where there are thoughts of god that are
[1:05:16] spoken
[1:05:19] that give us
[1:05:20] strength we can take a hold of that
[1:05:23] thought
[1:05:24] you know what i'll do
[1:05:25] it'll cast out other thoughts
[1:05:30] that's what's powerful because these
[1:05:32] thoughts listen paul
[1:05:34] paul wouldn't know about having an
[1:05:37] insight wherefore regarding this of the
[1:05:39] rapture wherefore
[1:05:41] comfort ye one another with these words
[1:05:47] certainly not anything else that's going
[1:05:48] on certainly not anything else
[1:05:52] we could mention a few things about this
[1:05:54] or that stock market or more no comfort
[1:05:57] are you hearing me
[1:05:59] but in the words of the lord there is
[1:06:01] comfort
[1:06:03] to the believer
[1:06:05] and may i say it like this sometimes
[1:06:08] it's not even in the part that you have
[1:06:11] to say anything
[1:06:13] because you also are the word made flesh
[1:06:17] sometimes it's the word made flesh just
[1:06:19] being present
[1:06:22] that'll stabilize and help and allow the
[1:06:25] spirit of god to come and minister
[1:06:27] in a situation
[1:06:28] so don't ever feel like oh i gotta have
[1:06:30] words to say and i gotta no sometimes
[1:06:32] it's just what needs to be is the word
[1:06:34] made flesh in you and me
[1:06:39] god help us
[1:06:41] name 1 7 the lord is good
[1:06:44] a stronghold in the day of trouble
[1:06:47] and he knoweth them that trust in him
[1:06:53] that trust in him you know what trust is
[1:06:56] it's when i don't know i don't
[1:06:58] understand and it's at all times trust
[1:07:00] in the lord at all times even when i can
[1:07:02] see things it looks like this is
[1:07:04] unfolding but when it's really important
[1:07:06] is is when i don't know what's going on
[1:07:11] even as young people when you can say i
[1:07:13] don't know what the next day hold i
[1:07:15] don't know what the next year holds but
[1:07:17] i can trust in you lord jesus
[1:07:20] i can trust in your leadership they can
[1:07:21] say what they want about or the job
[1:07:23] they're going to close this they're
[1:07:24] going to do that but you can say lord i
[1:07:26] trust in you
[1:07:29] i don't you know if i look at it i could
[1:07:31] say in my natural mind this is not
[1:07:34] possible
[1:07:36] this how could this be how could that be
[1:07:38] how can this work out oh surely this is
[1:07:40] they're going to close this or surely
[1:07:42] this is going to happen but as a
[1:07:43] believer we step back and say wait a
[1:07:45] minute i'm not going to concern myself
[1:07:48] like david said with things that are
[1:07:50] bigger than me i'm going to trust the
[1:07:54] lord david said with thoughts that are
[1:07:57] higher than me that's beyond me
[1:07:59] because you can look and say god put me
[1:08:01] here i didn't put myself here god put me
[1:08:03] here i didn't open this door god opened
[1:08:05] this door dosed for me to try to say how
[1:08:08] is this going to be it how is that going
[1:08:10] to be let's fellowship around this we're
[1:08:12] prone to that our human part is prone to
[1:08:15] that because of what does it do it kicks
[1:08:17] in for a manner of self-preservation but
[1:08:20] on the inside there's that which rises
[1:08:23] up and says lord i don't understand i
[1:08:26] don't know how but i trust you
[1:08:32] and that's greater that's greater than
[1:08:35] if we did know
[1:08:39] trust
[1:08:40] is greater than if we did know
[1:08:44] second corinthians 5 7 we walk
[1:08:48] by faith and
[1:08:50] brother branham talks about a symphony
[1:08:53] and we know that with a symphony there's
[1:08:56] there's changes
[1:08:57] somebody has composed that piece of
[1:08:59] music and
[1:09:00] there's changes in it
[1:09:02] there's a beginning part to it and
[1:09:04] probably every one of us have either
[1:09:06] been or watched
[1:09:09] viewed a symphony or a symphony brother
[1:09:11] brandon where he would relay it as a
[1:09:13] symphony tied in where there's a drama
[1:09:14] being acted out on stage and you refer
[1:09:17] to peter and the wolf and how that
[1:09:19] sometimes there's no speaking parts it's
[1:09:22] just simply
[1:09:23] what's happening you know like when the
[1:09:25] is it peter no yeah the wolf is coming
[1:09:27] up and they played that
[1:09:29] they didn't know there's certain notes
[1:09:31] that are incorporated that let you know
[1:09:33] something
[1:09:35] is at hand
[1:09:37] some sort of event where you're just
[1:09:38] like
[1:09:38] oh you know
[1:09:40] where you're looking what is it it's the
[1:09:41] music
[1:09:42] that gives you that indication
[1:09:45] and the composer when the composer who
[1:09:47] wrote that piece
[1:09:49] he so incorporated it that there would
[1:09:52] be highs
[1:09:54] and low
[1:09:56] there would be mid the mid-range notes
[1:09:58] all of those
[1:10:00] notes would harmoniously together
[1:10:02] because it's like on a piano
[1:10:04] if all we played was high notes
[1:10:07] it wouldn't the song wouldn't have the
[1:10:09] beauty
[1:10:11] if you played only low notes
[1:10:14] on a piano the song would not have the
[1:10:16] beauty
[1:10:17] but it's having the blend of all the
[1:10:19] notes
[1:10:20] high notes
[1:10:22] little low notes
[1:10:24] the mid-range
[1:10:26] all those things coming together that
[1:10:27] just where you and i sometimes can sit
[1:10:29] back and say
[1:10:31] man
[1:10:32] that is a beautiful piece of music
[1:10:36] but in order for it to be a piece of
[1:10:37] music it's got to have eyes
[1:10:40] and it's got to have lows
[1:10:42] that's how it is
[1:10:44] with our lives
[1:10:46] this is exactly how there's changes that
[1:10:49] happen brother van talks about the
[1:10:51] changes that have happened he said in
[1:10:53] the gospel of how god has had it so laid
[1:10:56] out in this great peace that he has
[1:10:59] composed
[1:11:00] that his inspiration that mood remember
[1:11:03] the bible said that the prophets were
[1:11:05] moved by the spirit of god and they came
[1:11:07] under the influence of the divine
[1:11:10] composer and they would begin to put
[1:11:12] this high note
[1:11:14] and then they would begin to go down to
[1:11:15] the bass clef and they would put this
[1:11:17] note in right here and then they would
[1:11:19] go up to this one and put this one in
[1:11:21] and this would be placed in and and
[1:11:23] there's only one that can bring about
[1:11:26] those the the the notes and that's the
[1:11:29] same one his inspiration that it would
[1:11:31] come down
[1:11:32] upon the director that's present at that
[1:11:34] time and there are hearts and lives that
[1:11:37] that are are captivated
[1:11:40] under that on by that of of of the
[1:11:42] inspiration of the hour and they're
[1:11:44] looking into that and here the director
[1:11:46] is just it's simply inspiration moving
[1:11:49] down just like it was in the days of
[1:11:51] luther when luther came under that
[1:11:53] inspiration of the just shall live by
[1:11:55] faith it was a part in the sheet music
[1:11:58] and and there were those who were locked
[1:12:00] in ordained to hear that and it wasn't
[1:12:02] them it was the grace of god that
[1:12:04] reached out and that inspiration what
[1:12:06] god had in his mind
[1:12:08] it caught hold and it reflected in her
[1:12:10] life so what the music sheet was saying
[1:12:12] the inspiration was reflecting and
[1:12:15] acting out in the lives of the people
[1:12:18] and that's the same way as it as it
[1:12:20] continued on down and on through but yet
[1:12:23] within the midst of every one of those
[1:12:25] junctions and those changes
[1:12:28] every life
[1:12:30] goes through
[1:12:32] even in its own part
[1:12:34] the ups
[1:12:36] the downs
[1:12:38] every one of our lives when
[1:12:40] david would write many are the
[1:12:42] afflictions
[1:12:44] of the righteous
[1:12:46] but the lord delivereth them
[1:12:49] out of them all
[1:12:52] and this is where when brother braham is
[1:12:54] talking about the changes of the music
[1:12:56] sheet now listen as he says this he says
[1:12:58] let us follow with the rhythm of the
[1:13:00] word whatever the music beats for that
[1:13:02] hour
[1:13:03] beat with it
[1:13:05] many people asked why
[1:13:08] they asked sometimes they asked me why
[1:13:10] why must these things happen why did
[1:13:13] this happen to me why did i start and
[1:13:15] this happened and i had this trouble
[1:13:17] here and this upset me here and i lost
[1:13:19] this here it's natural
[1:13:22] can i say this right here
[1:13:24] god doesn't get frustrated
[1:13:28] with questions
[1:13:31] are you hearing me
[1:13:32] they communed and reasoned
[1:13:36] together
[1:13:38] but you know what he drew near
[1:13:42] they couldn't understand but when they
[1:13:44] were looking at everything and there was
[1:13:46] he drew near
[1:13:49] and when you and i there's these
[1:13:50] questions that we have it's not like oh
[1:13:53] oh you've asked why you're a sinner
[1:13:55] that's nonsense
[1:13:57] there's times where we it sometimes can
[1:13:59] come out it can come out why i i don't
[1:14:02] you know and you know you know it's not
[1:14:03] you're questioning god but sometimes you
[1:14:05] you look at things you might think i
[1:14:07] don't understand this i don't understand
[1:14:08] that but see that's why there's
[1:14:10] something greater inside of our life
[1:14:13] that though we cannot explain it i can't
[1:14:16] understand it but like job said though
[1:14:18] he slayed me yet will i trust him
[1:14:23] brother look what brother braham said
[1:14:25] sometimes i've asked why
[1:14:31] sometimes i've asked why
[1:14:33] why when i was just a young minister and
[1:14:36] first started out did god take my wife
[1:14:38] right out from under me
[1:14:40] take my baby right from beneath me
[1:14:43] right beneath my heart why
[1:14:46] did he do that
[1:14:47] i don't know
[1:14:49] i do now
[1:14:52] see all the time he says i don't i
[1:14:54] didn't know
[1:14:55] but i do now
[1:14:58] now brother braham will talk about in
[1:14:59] 1951 where there's an understanding
[1:15:01] that's coming to him but i want you to
[1:15:03] see this is a powerful statement that he
[1:15:05] makes here i didn't know i do now
[1:15:09] i just held my hand in his and kept
[1:15:14] trusting
[1:15:17] i don't understand why that he took my
[1:15:20] wife why he undertook why he took my
[1:15:22] baby
[1:15:24] i mean wouldn't think of it would it
[1:15:26] make sense
[1:15:27] to you or to me i don't every time i've
[1:15:30] went through that of the life story and
[1:15:31] i read you know brother owen jurgeson's
[1:15:33] the supernatural books and i hear
[1:15:36] brother brown talk about it and grips
[1:15:38] your heart and i always remember brother
[1:15:40] herb keithley said he said anytime he
[1:15:42] said i feel like i've got a hard trial i
[1:15:43] feel like i'm going through a hard time
[1:15:45] he said brother samuel you know what i
[1:15:46] do he says i put on the life story he
[1:15:48] said i realized god forgive me for
[1:15:50] complaining i don't got no problems at
[1:15:51] all
[1:15:53] he knew how to he knew how to approach
[1:15:55] it
[1:15:56] but you know how brother graham talks
[1:15:57] about think about it billy being just so
[1:16:00] so small still having a bottle you you
[1:16:03] and i would look at it and say but god
[1:16:05] it doesn't make sense
[1:16:07] he needs a mother
[1:16:12] i'm just being real
[1:16:14] brother braham said he didn't understand
[1:16:16] it he didn't know why
[1:16:18] but this is what he said this is what
[1:16:20] brought him through i kept my hand in
[1:16:23] his hand
[1:16:25] and i just kept trusting
[1:16:28] what are we doing we're keeping our hand
[1:16:30] in his hand and we keep trusting i don't
[1:16:32] know i don't understand everything i
[1:16:34] don't have an explanation but i'm gonna
[1:16:36] keep my hand in his hand and i'm just
[1:16:39] gonna trust him
[1:16:48] when they think of the sister we were
[1:16:50] praying for out of brother mike wall's
[1:16:51] church
[1:16:52] here last monday knew that that was that
[1:16:55] was coming
[1:16:56] you know
[1:16:57] and she went on home to be with the lord
[1:16:59] when i say knew what was coming we knew
[1:17:01] there i knew i knew at the time they'd
[1:17:02] asked us to pray
[1:17:04] the text had come in across the thread
[1:17:05] the ministers asked us to pray
[1:17:09] and think that was since the first of
[1:17:11] august remember i mentioned that two
[1:17:12] years of congregation the sister just
[1:17:15] gave birth
[1:17:17] to their third child
[1:17:18] she never saw the child
[1:17:25] brothers which which should have been
[1:17:27] you had you had brothers it's it's you
[1:17:29] know you you're just encouraging you're
[1:17:31] standing in prayer brother mike we're
[1:17:33] praying we're in in the churches and all
[1:17:35] around people we're praying
[1:17:37] and you stop and look at it
[1:17:40] because it's these statements were made
[1:17:42] before
[1:17:43] everything we don't know what god's
[1:17:44] decision is even in this here our minds
[1:17:47] cannot fathom that part of it we would
[1:17:50] look and say that baby needs a mother
[1:17:52] that husband needs a wife and a mother
[1:17:55] to care for those children
[1:18:02] but i mean what explanation is it
[1:18:04] i don't have one the only thing i can
[1:18:06] say is is god is perfect in all his ways
[1:18:12] we sing a song here but i think it's
[1:18:15] more than just a song we'll understand
[1:18:18] it better by and by
[1:18:24] hallelujah i i don't know i just just
[1:18:26] you know within these things so notice
[1:18:29] there's highs and lows and all of this
[1:18:31] blends together
[1:18:32] in ecclesiastes 3 1 it says to
[1:18:35] everything
[1:18:37] there is a season
[1:18:39] and a time to every purpose under the
[1:18:41] heaven
[1:18:43] i could go through and read those down
[1:18:44] through verse 8 but i won't for sake of
[1:18:46] time
[1:18:48] david said
[1:18:49] my times are in thy hand
[1:18:55] my times there's
[1:18:57] as job could write and say
[1:18:59] in job 14 5 speaking
[1:19:02] of that the fragileness
[1:19:05] of this
[1:19:06] life
[1:19:08] it doesn't matter how where a person
[1:19:11] might be at
[1:19:13] no matter from
[1:19:15] where they're in youth middle and
[1:19:17] it doesn't matter
[1:19:19] this life
[1:19:21] is so fragile
[1:19:23] it's so fragile it's so fragile
[1:19:30] and joe could write
[1:19:32] of a man who's born of a woman is a few
[1:19:34] days old and feel full of trouble
[1:19:37] and he writes it in this way he says
[1:19:38] seeing his days
[1:19:40] are determined
[1:19:43] and the number of months are with thee
[1:19:45] and thou has appointed his bounds
[1:19:47] that he
[1:19:48] cannot pass
[1:19:51] and i just want to
[1:19:53] say it in this manner god's timing and
[1:19:55] his purpose
[1:19:56] is precise
[1:19:59] we don't understand it
[1:20:01] but it's precise
[1:20:06] there's a lot of things that we
[1:20:08] like i said we don't understand brother
[1:20:10] brown was saying in his own part let me
[1:20:12] go into a part that just was on my heart
[1:20:14] the lord just placed it on my heart here
[1:20:16] the other day
[1:20:19] brother brown's out on a meeting and he
[1:20:21] comes back in from a meeting
[1:20:24] there is a he's describing the setting
[1:20:26] of the situation where
[1:20:28] he says there was a family that had come
[1:20:30] to the tabernacle from kentucky
[1:20:33] he said they had come there for years
[1:20:35] he said they were fine people good
[1:20:37] friends of mine real friends of mine he
[1:20:39] said but he said they were just one of
[1:20:41] those kind of people that when a revival
[1:20:43] was going on
[1:20:44] they would come to church
[1:20:46] but when the revival was off and the
[1:20:48] load was pulling nobody would pull
[1:20:51] and all the children was here on the
[1:20:53] crater wall
[1:20:54] and we had our classes and things and i
[1:20:56] i said that because brother brown said
[1:20:58] it for a background for things that
[1:20:59] he'll mention within this situation
[1:21:03] and brother branham so he's he's given
[1:21:05] us that situation here
[1:21:07] and he says i come home one day from a
[1:21:09] meeting
[1:21:10] and here was a young girl he said she
[1:21:12] had been here on the cradle roll
[1:21:14] sunday school and so forth
[1:21:16] when she was eight years old and things
[1:21:19] she was married had two children
[1:21:21] she was laying out in the hospital at
[1:21:23] this at this time at the point of death
[1:21:26] and she had
[1:21:28] she had
[1:21:29] uh had a baby that was four or five
[1:21:32] months old but that baby had died it was
[1:21:34] within her it had died within her and
[1:21:36] they couldn't operate to take the baby
[1:21:39] out because she had uremic
[1:21:40] poisoning because it
[1:21:43] oh they were they couldn't operate so
[1:21:45] they were going to have to let the
[1:21:46] mother die too
[1:21:50] brother graham said i went out to see
[1:21:51] her because she sent for me
[1:21:53] he raised up the oxygen tent
[1:21:56] do you remember me sure brother bill i
[1:21:58] remember you
[1:22:00] do you understand sister how sick you
[1:22:02] are
[1:22:02] she said i do that's why i sent for you
[1:22:05] i said well how how is it with you and
[1:22:07] the lord
[1:22:09] brother bill
[1:22:10] i'm not ready to
[1:22:16] the gram said we got down in the room
[1:22:18] and her mother and her husband and them
[1:22:20] we started crying
[1:22:22] she got right with god she paid her vows
[1:22:24] come back and make god the promise if
[1:22:26] she'd be forgiven how she loved him
[1:22:28] sorry for her sins the way she had lived
[1:22:30] and
[1:22:31] she went on with her repentance and
[1:22:32] crying after a while i got up and went
[1:22:34] out of the building the next morning he
[1:22:36] said they called me and they come in
[1:22:38] that morning to do a test to see how the
[1:22:41] uremic condition had advanced
[1:22:44] and found out
[1:22:46] she didn't have a spec
[1:22:49] it was all gone
[1:22:50] every bit of the uremic poison had left
[1:22:54] and the doctors were so excited
[1:22:58] they said wow this is this is so
[1:23:01] very strange tomorrow morning we're
[1:23:03] gonna if it's still this way in the
[1:23:05] morning we're going to operate and take
[1:23:07] the dead baby out
[1:23:09] so they were given her penicillins and
[1:23:11] things like that to keep infection down
[1:23:13] and but rem said through that same day
[1:23:14] they tested her about two or three more
[1:23:16] times
[1:23:18] nothing was wrong no uremic poisoning
[1:23:20] nothing and they prepped her
[1:23:23] for that for that surgery part of the
[1:23:25] prepping was taking her out of the
[1:23:27] oxygen tent brother braham said
[1:23:28] everything was fine they were going to
[1:23:30] operate the next morning
[1:23:32] brahman said i never knew it he said the
[1:23:34] lord never told me anything
[1:23:36] brother brahm said he here here he was
[1:23:39] going into the room
[1:23:41] and her husband
[1:23:43] he being a sinner come over to me
[1:23:46] and he said brother branham i want to
[1:23:48] give my life to the lord jesus
[1:23:51] you see
[1:23:52] there's an effect
[1:23:54] that's being had
[1:23:57] her husband
[1:23:59] he's he was crying with her but now this
[1:24:02] next day he says i want to give my life
[1:24:05] to the lord jesus
[1:24:09] but rem said all right he said let's
[1:24:10] kneel down here you take your wife's
[1:24:12] hands and
[1:24:13] you walk this straight life together
[1:24:15] then the mother came back to him and
[1:24:17] brother brahma you know here's me and my
[1:24:19] children we've been in and out and in
[1:24:21] and out of the tabernacle and things and
[1:24:23] we sit and listen that you preach and
[1:24:24] we'll go up to the altar and we'd come
[1:24:26] back and said i'm backslid too brother
[1:24:28] branham said i want to come back to the
[1:24:30] lord jesus for his goodness to my child
[1:24:34] abraham said that's very nice
[1:24:36] but you don't come to the lord jesus
[1:24:37] because of that
[1:24:43] so the husband you know he really i'm a
[1:24:45] sinner i need to i want to give my life
[1:24:47] to the lord
[1:24:48] but the mother was saying
[1:24:50] i just want to i want to i want to
[1:24:52] rededicate my life because of his
[1:24:54] goodness to my daughter
[1:24:56] the brand said that's not a reason
[1:24:59] that's not a reason
[1:25:02] notice you say well brother samuel
[1:25:03] what's the reason the reason is is to
[1:25:05] recognize because that brother branham
[1:25:07] was
[1:25:08] is pointing out that ain't gonna hold
[1:25:11] that ain't gonna hold
[1:25:13] what to recognize is it's giving your
[1:25:15] life to him
[1:25:18] you know you can give your life to a
[1:25:20] church
[1:25:21] and that's all you've done
[1:25:25] but he came that we might have
[1:25:27] life
[1:25:29] is to give our life to him
[1:25:33] so about midnight that same night the
[1:25:36] the daughter she calls her and she
[1:25:38] called her mother over she said well
[1:25:40] honey what do you want she said mama
[1:25:43] what do you want honey she said you know
[1:25:45] she said i'm so happy
[1:25:48] she said i'm glad you're being happy he
[1:25:50] said mama i'm at peace with god and oh
[1:25:52] how fine it is
[1:25:55] she said mother
[1:25:56] mama said yes she said i'm going home
[1:26:00] mama said i know you are
[1:26:02] yes sweetheart the doctor is they're
[1:26:04] gonna take the baby tomorrow and about a
[1:26:06] day or two your incisions heal up and
[1:26:08] you get away from here and you get back
[1:26:09] home and you'll be happy again you and
[1:26:11] your hubby and little children be a
[1:26:12] christian live for god she said mother
[1:26:15] i mean i'm going to my heavenly home
[1:26:18] i'm going to my heavenly home
[1:26:20] she said sure honey at the end of the
[1:26:22] journey
[1:26:23] she said mama this is the end of the
[1:26:25] journey
[1:26:27] oh she said now now what what what's the
[1:26:29] matter mama said that the end of the
[1:26:31] journey he said yes mother
[1:26:33] within a few minutes
[1:26:35] i'll be gone
[1:26:37] well mama thought she had been nervous
[1:26:38] and delirious so the nurse came in and
[1:26:40] took all the you know the respiration
[1:26:42] and everything
[1:26:43] brother bran said everything was normal
[1:26:46] within five minutes of that moment
[1:26:49] she was gone
[1:26:50] she was dead
[1:26:53] brother branham was out on a meeting and
[1:26:55] so he comes back
[1:26:56] and he finds out that brother graham
[1:26:58] snelling had preached the girl's funeral
[1:27:01] brother brown got them you know he got
[1:27:03] the information from sister meaty
[1:27:05] the girl had died
[1:27:07] i want you to watch what brother brown
[1:27:09] says here
[1:27:11] he says i don't know what caused me to
[1:27:13] do it
[1:27:14] but i said lord god you owe me an
[1:27:18] understanding
[1:27:26] lord god
[1:27:27] you owe me an understanding
[1:27:29] after me now here's what he's basing it
[1:27:31] on you owe me an understanding after me
[1:27:34] going out there
[1:27:35] telling that husband and him coming to
[1:27:37] the lord after you've done these things
[1:27:39] for him and all like that and then take
[1:27:41] the girl's life like that you owe me an
[1:27:45] understanding
[1:27:48] brahma said when you tell god something
[1:27:49] like that
[1:27:51] he'll leave you sitting alone
[1:27:53] you don't owe me nothing i'm in debt to
[1:27:56] him
[1:27:57] he let me pout it out for a few days
[1:27:59] think of this
[1:28:01] three or four months later
[1:28:05] finally god answers him about this
[1:28:13] and the lord spoke to him in vision and
[1:28:15] said
[1:28:16] this is what i want you to do i want you
[1:28:18] to go to her mother
[1:28:20] and i want you to say this to her mother
[1:28:22] did not her time come the year before
[1:28:25] that
[1:28:26] when she was drowning in a creek on a
[1:28:29] picnic
[1:28:31] i'm talking about the young lady who
[1:28:33] passed with the baby on the inside did
[1:28:36] not her time come
[1:28:38] the year before that
[1:28:42] she should have went at that time
[1:28:45] this is the lord talking but i had to
[1:28:48] take her
[1:28:49] when she was ready to go
[1:28:52] i had to take her when she was ready to
[1:28:55] go
[1:28:57] and that's why all this happened and why
[1:29:01] you went out there
[1:29:04] but bram said i got down and i cried i
[1:29:05] said lord jesus forgive your poor stupid
[1:29:07] servant i should never have said that
[1:29:09] lord
[1:29:10] he went down the street and he talked to
[1:29:12] the mama he said i got to ask you a
[1:29:14] question
[1:29:15] sure brother bill is it true that this
[1:29:17] girl
[1:29:18] your daughter almost drowned
[1:29:20] she said that's right brother branham
[1:29:23] she said they had to give her artificial
[1:29:25] respiration when they finally pulled her
[1:29:26] out of the creek
[1:29:28] it was on a picnic
[1:29:30] and her dress had went up around and she
[1:29:31] couldn't get up through all of that and
[1:29:33] and they had to give her artificial
[1:29:35] respiration to even bring her back at
[1:29:38] that moment
[1:29:41] brother brown said
[1:29:43] that was her time
[1:29:45] to go
[1:29:47] and then brother branham ends it this
[1:29:49] way he says see
[1:29:51] god knows
[1:29:52] what he's doing
[1:29:58] think of it you see in our
[1:30:00] without that part
[1:30:02] brother adam was looking just as you and
[1:30:04] i would look at it
[1:30:06] here is a young mother that finally
[1:30:10] that
[1:30:11] she was in a family that was in and out
[1:30:13] of the tabernacle when things were going
[1:30:15] good and revival was there they were in
[1:30:17] church and then eventually just cool off
[1:30:19] and go away and they were in and out in
[1:30:22] and out and that's what that's all she
[1:30:24] had seen
[1:30:26] but then
[1:30:27] in this moment god
[1:30:29] allowed this situation think of it when
[1:30:31] she drowned like that she never called
[1:30:33] for brother branham
[1:30:36] i wonder brother bran don't go into this
[1:30:38] whether or not they came back to church
[1:30:39] for a period of time after she drowned
[1:30:43] he doesn't tell us that i don't know
[1:30:45] that maybe if i talk maybe if i would
[1:30:47] have known about all this i could have
[1:30:48] talked to some of the brothers i was
[1:30:50] with this past weekend and asked him a
[1:30:52] little bit of background on some of this
[1:30:55] maybe i could have called him up before
[1:30:56] tonight but anyhow god didn't it wasn't
[1:30:58] necessary
[1:31:00] the point is at this moment
[1:31:03] something changed in her life to where
[1:31:05] she was ready
[1:31:08] it wasn't just coming to church that
[1:31:10] made her ready
[1:31:11] it wasn't being around the branham
[1:31:13] tabernacle that made her ready
[1:31:16] it wasn't knowing god sent a prophet
[1:31:18] that made her ready
[1:31:20] what made her ready is to receive the
[1:31:22] preparation that the lord jesus had
[1:31:25] already made she had to receive and
[1:31:29] repent and lay down her life
[1:31:33] it took an awful long time how old that
[1:31:36] she was as a young mother with two
[1:31:38] children let alone this one that already
[1:31:40] passed within her womb
[1:31:45] and the husband
[1:31:46] you would think in this moment lord here
[1:31:48] they are they're going to serve you
[1:31:50] together as a husband and wife the
[1:31:51] husband was led to the lord
[1:31:56] but god's timing
[1:31:58] and his purpose
[1:32:00] are perfect
[1:32:06] if we could talk to that husband i don't
[1:32:08] know whatever became but let's just say
[1:32:10] we could talk to that husband no doubt
[1:32:11] probably standing on the other side by
[1:32:13] now i would assume at any rate
[1:32:16] if we could have asked that husband at
[1:32:18] that moment
[1:32:19] would you would you have desired your
[1:32:21] wife to stay here who wouldn't have
[1:32:24] you think it didn't tear him up
[1:32:26] but then once could you imagine once
[1:32:29] coming on to the other side
[1:32:32] and then recognizing
[1:32:36] god
[1:32:37] allowed that
[1:32:40] to draw and reconcile
[1:32:43] those hearts
[1:32:44] to him
[1:32:48] brother braham didn't understand
[1:32:51] it didn't make sense to him just like a
[1:32:52] lot of things don't make sense to us
[1:32:55] but in the midst of it
[1:32:57] may we keep our hand
[1:33:00] in his hands
[1:33:02] and keep
[1:33:04] trusting
[1:33:05] because we don't know all that god is
[1:33:07] doing
[1:33:09] and will do even even
[1:33:12] in this
[1:33:14] situation
[1:33:16] that has come about and there's other
[1:33:19] i said there's been others other
[1:33:20] situations before that i won't go in but
[1:33:23] out of it
[1:33:25] sometimes you have no idea we have no
[1:33:28] idea we may not know till we get to the
[1:33:30] other side
[1:33:32] of the effect
[1:33:35] but i just say god
[1:33:37] let me just keep my hand in here
[1:33:42] it's one thing as a pastor there's only
[1:33:43] one place i can point you to and take
[1:33:45] you to and point you to that great
[1:33:47] source of comfort and that's the lord
[1:33:48] jesus
[1:33:49] he's the one that
[1:33:51] he's the one that's got us through
[1:33:53] hard times tough times before he's the
[1:33:55] one that's brought us through we didn't
[1:33:57] bring ourselves through
[1:34:01] even when we didn't feel like he was
[1:34:03] near
[1:34:05] he said
[1:34:06] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:34:08] golden candlesticks
[1:34:10] i
[1:34:11] know
[1:34:13] i'll never leave you
[1:34:15] nor forsake you
[1:34:19] and it's his presence
[1:34:21] that comes comes among us it's him
[1:34:24] that has brought us safe this far
[1:34:27] and he will take us
[1:34:29] safely home
[1:34:30] the same god that has brought healing in
[1:34:32] our lives of things of questions that we
[1:34:34] could have but in the midst of it with
[1:34:36] every question we have to place it into
[1:34:39] into his hands and say god i trust
[1:34:41] you
[1:34:43] i trust
[1:34:45] you lord jesus
[1:34:49] that's who we're looking to
[1:34:52] i don't know what i don't know what all
[1:34:55] that god
[1:34:57] will do out of this i don't know i don't
[1:34:58] even try to i don't even if just like
[1:35:00] with every other situation i've always
[1:35:02] looked at in this way lord i don't know
[1:35:04] all but i know you're in control
[1:35:09] i know you're in control
[1:35:12] and i think
[1:35:13] as i just i i'm just to make this
[1:35:16] statement
[1:35:18] here was here was ryan walker
[1:35:22] just
[1:35:23] months ago
[1:35:26] things i remember seeing different
[1:35:27] pictures so forth
[1:35:30] but
[1:35:31] back in august of 2020
[1:35:33] we got done minute we were
[1:35:35] finished ministering a meeting and right
[1:35:37] here and my family and i were taking
[1:35:39] right out on that sunday right
[1:35:40] afterwards
[1:35:43] and as i
[1:35:44] pull up to our destination
[1:35:47] i look down and i have a little text i
[1:35:49] have a text now i don't know who it is
[1:35:51] but he had to he alerted me to who it
[1:35:53] was
[1:35:54] he said brother samuel
[1:35:57] this is ryan walker
[1:36:00] i need to speak
[1:36:04] he said
[1:36:06] the lord's been dealing with my life
[1:36:09] and i want to be baptized in the name of
[1:36:11] the lord jesus christ
[1:36:15] so
[1:36:16] went out away from the family and just
[1:36:18] began to talk to him and talk
[1:36:21] as we conversed
[1:36:23] and you know we couldn't baptize him
[1:36:24] right here in august because they were
[1:36:26] working on the baptistery
[1:36:29] so
[1:36:30] in between that time he said when i get
[1:36:32] i you know he really wanted before he
[1:36:33] went to college and he said when i come
[1:36:35] home on a break
[1:36:37] he says when i get home he said i want a
[1:36:38] break he said at any time you let me
[1:36:40] know
[1:36:41] well you know it was a little bit
[1:36:42] working on this
[1:36:44] we finally had it and
[1:36:46] sister rebecca his sister
[1:36:49] and zachary were baptized the first part
[1:36:51] of october
[1:36:52] long story short when he comes home for
[1:36:55] christmas break
[1:36:57] i'm just going to be real okay
[1:37:00] sometimes you you look you you know that
[1:37:02] when a person has made it repented we
[1:37:06] prayed together there on the phone and
[1:37:07] even where he was already he said
[1:37:09] brother samuel at that point in august
[1:37:11] of 2020
[1:37:12] he said
[1:37:14] god has been dealing with my heart since
[1:37:16] january
[1:37:17] of 2012.
[1:37:19] so it wasn't
[1:37:21] a coveted conviction
[1:37:23] are you hearing me now
[1:37:25] he said since january god's been dealing
[1:37:27] with my heart
[1:37:31] so then right here in december
[1:37:33] of 2020
[1:37:34] the 27th
[1:37:37] we baptized him in the name of the lord
[1:37:38] jesus christ
[1:37:42] he went to college and i told different
[1:37:44] ones of the young people i had them i

[1:38:48] guide me through college and just help
[1:38:50] me in this semester
[1:38:52] many times we you know i had the
[1:38:55] texting back and forth conversations i
[1:38:56] didn't know all the times his classes
[1:38:58] were you know just just doing that i
[1:39:00] remember what it was being there on
[1:39:01] campus and things but i just
[1:39:04] within it all when i i look at it
[1:39:09] when that news struck me that day
[1:39:13] the thing that i could look back on and
[1:39:14] said god
[1:39:16] thank you
[1:39:17] that i've got a place
[1:39:20] we've got a place that we can look at
[1:39:22] that there's a heart
[1:39:24] that you touched and responded to you
[1:39:27] i could go into more conversations of
[1:39:29] different things but his heart's desire
[1:39:32] even what god would have for him
[1:39:34] when it came as he looked at for
[1:39:37] marrying and everything else he as he
[1:39:39] would express it to you know his sister
[1:39:42] and different ones he said i want
[1:39:43] someone
[1:39:44] who's going to be right in the house of
[1:39:46] god with me
[1:39:50] that was his
[1:39:52] concern i just want to say this in this
[1:39:55] manner
[1:39:57] that's a place where we can draw
[1:40:00] comfort and strength from
[1:40:05] real comfort a real strength
[1:40:08] 20 years old
[1:40:11] we don't understand
[1:40:12] the why
[1:40:15] we don't understand that i'm sure that
[1:40:18] we probably
[1:40:20] i don't i'm not looking
[1:40:22] in this moment or in this time
[1:40:25] to understand
[1:40:28] and just put my hand in his hand
[1:40:32] i don't understand it but i know your
[1:40:34] timing
[1:40:35] in your purpose lord
[1:40:37] our hearts
[1:40:38] his parents hearts our hearts
[1:40:42] grieving
[1:40:45] the young man that in every moment that
[1:40:47] he could be within the youth meetings
[1:40:49] and right there
[1:40:51] write a part of it
[1:40:53] right there
[1:40:56] and say
[1:40:57] do god be the glory
[1:41:00] i say to god be the glory
[1:41:03] we may not understand it
[1:41:05] but god's got a purpose
[1:41:08] god's timing
[1:41:10] is perfect
[1:41:13] i pray that god gives us strength
[1:41:16] when i say first
[1:41:18] god give the family strength
[1:41:22] give them strength give them comfort
[1:41:24] let's keep them before the throne of god
[1:41:29] in these moments it's like this and if
[1:41:31] god would help us to grasp a hold of
[1:41:34] even these moments
[1:41:36] this is a
[1:41:38] it's a moment where there's like
[1:41:39] lightning striking and everything else
[1:41:43] need god with skin
[1:41:45] need god with skin
[1:41:50] we need one another
[1:41:54] we need one another
[1:41:56] let's hold them up in prayer
[1:41:58] continue i know you are i know you are
[1:42:01] let's continue to hold them up in prayer
[1:42:03] and just ask that god lord
[1:42:06] have your way
[1:42:08] move forward move for each life move for
[1:42:10] each heart i don't know because tuesday
[1:42:12] and wednesday it's hard to tell
[1:42:15] on wednesday at that funeral
[1:42:18] on how many and who all will be there
[1:42:22] god knows
[1:42:25] did you hear me
[1:42:26] i said god knows
[1:42:30] i've spoken funerals for individuals
[1:42:32] that i never knew in this lifetime
[1:42:35] but i took that opportunity
[1:42:37] because through that appointment
[1:42:39] might be a moment to reach a soul that
[1:42:42] they could see jesus
[1:42:45] i ask you let's just really be in prayer
[1:42:47] for all these things that's going to
[1:42:49] just help us and i would just say it in
[1:42:51] this manner i don't mean to keep going
[1:42:53] i want to just say if every if anything
[1:42:56] at all
[1:42:58] it's just the value that we can look at
[1:43:00] and say god
[1:43:02] let me just be
[1:43:04] with my hand in your hand
[1:43:06] and just trust him bless you
[1:43:09] heavenly father

[1:43:40] have words i don't have
[1:43:43] where i could
[1:43:44] understand
[1:43:45] the reality is is that even if you did
