nobody else like you know [Music] you are there is no one else like there is no a man well that ain't nothing but the truth you know before you look to you about a lot of things they said wow this is just something how this took place a lot of miracles but there's one miracle that once you experience that then the whole whole paradox the whole reality opens up of the Lord and that's that miracle of the new birth amen and it's a paradox how Christ how he's drawn us to himself to even think that where we would have a desire it's because he gave and placed that desire within us and so then moving him moving upon that to draw us and open up to us the way that we can come that the desire that he placed in our life might come to a fulfillment in him there's no other place that we could ever be fulfilled because there's nothing that could fulfill and match that desire outside of the place that it was ordained for and that was in Christ you know how it is with a plan you go to ask him about a plant and they'll ask you how much Sun you get you get when when's your Sun come up is it a 2 to 6 hours 2 to 4 hours they want to know how much light because if they give you a plant that needs more light it's going to die there because it doesn't get sufficient light so vice versa but I'm thankful to God we can testify from our lives we were not made for just one or two hours of light we were made for the light amen and our lives our strength everything about our life it comes from him who is the light God is light and in him is no darkness oh my just reading in Isaiah chapter 30 and we were dealing with last week in there of how that it speaks of where that be son itself and the moon would actually give the show that scientists the strength of the Sun in its time it would actually shine in a Sevenfold manner to think in this hour that we're living in it's not just one lamp it's not just one light but it is all of that light that has come together to show us in this hour make known to us no wonder the scripture could say rise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee we're not just walking in a partial light we are walking in the fullness of the light in this hour when Christ Himself has as the completion and the finishing of his body once again the Son of man living in human flesh amen that's a reality in this hour for our lives it's a very precious day to be living in for the world oh my it's a it's a terrible day but it's a wonderful hour to be a Christian and if them today if that's not settled in your heart what a more perfect time than to have that settled in your life amen God is so mindful we want to just welcome brother Don and sister Loretta you're with us and sister sherry we appreciate them being here with us this morning amen and we certainly appreciate the liberty of the Holy Spirit we really appreciate the liberty of the Holy Ghost you know that's a great precious precious reality in this hour and we thank God for that and we just want to pull on the gift of God this morning what God has for us as we're asking when asked sister sherry she's gonna come and sing for us this morning as brother John would make his way on out while she's singing but I'd like to she's making her way on up I'd like to raise the lift the mission offering this morning and brother Steven tabali we remember we had taken a special offering back in January and we sent that into Uganda there and we're also as soon as I get back to reports and things from that brother Tim Dodd who is one that has actually been overseeing that a lot of the the distribution there I've I've had probably I just had another video pop on my phone here this morning where brother Tim Dodd is is ministering there two ministers have come out of the Baptist and their wives the Pentecostal and their wives and he's ministering to them in this time and you just see so many that that as the light has touched their lives they are just rejoicing in this light and matter of fact the video that brother Steven of Bali sent me this morning there's not even room to sit down people just kept coming there's no room they ran out of chairs so people are just and we're not just talking about a little building like this we're talking of a much larger place they just don't have room and so you know I know that you know God will bless in the efforts and though we may not ever see them but yet we know the purpose that we have a desire in our heart and that's that everyone itself would come to know the Lord Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection that this message that God has sent us to it points us and brings us into that reality with the Lord Jesus Christ that's our desire for every heart every person we talked to that they would know the Lord Jesus in that way and we also want to continue to pray as we've also been channeling the funds continuously down there for the printing work in the and I don't mean to keep your brothers stand-in here over the work that's going on there printing over there in in Honduras and some things possibly I'll just speak at a at a different time because there's no more books themselves are no longer being printed by the voice of God but there's a need for books to continue to be printed and I can share that with you and we have a little bit more of a detail of time and how that that is such a need that has been expressed by pastors overseas and the Bari coffee has actually been inventoried that need and seeing that and thankfully there's some places where they've been able to contract and actually get it to where that there are books that they can have produced even in other places such as the seven church age book the seven seals which are massive books to print you can't print those off a printer like like the other books that we're dealing with right now you can print those books off of a printer but the other but some of the other ones they they just can't do that so they've contracted with a printer for other places overseas to do that and we'll just talk about that in a little bit later time when we have some more time but let's just let's just approach the Lord here in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we just thank you for this wonderful day lore that you've given us nor though it is a day when we look outside it's it's awful gloomy but father we're speaking of the day that's rose in our hearts Lord that day that is dawned in our hearts Lord God whereby father we not only express Lord from our lips but our life expresses Shalom oh God our light has come Lord father how we thank you for your mercy and your grace in this hour we pray that Lord that you'll bless Lord the offering that's being lifted here Lord bless the worshippers Lord is father they would sacrifice Lord God and I pray that Lord that you would take father what little Lord that father that we would have Lord because it wouldn't matter Lord if we had a million dollars to give it still is little comparison to the need but father it's nothing Lord for you to take what little Lord god when it's given from the heart Lord for you love a cheerful Giver and you can take that Lord like you took that little lads lunch Lord God and you multiplied Lord God and you seen to it that every need was meant so Lord we don't worry we just rest and we committed into your hands Lord God from our hearts father and just ask that you will do the same father for these needs Lord God and the other countries Lord God father we love you and we thank your Lord and ask that you'll just be with us and remaining part of this service and this day father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Amen god bless you they're collecting as they're taking that up sister sherry god bless you

harbour and the ship of hope passing your friends have no answers and peace just can't be found oh but there's a hand of Mercy the can turn it with nothing but a miracle - there's my family at the hand of God cannot bring you through well not no he's more than able and they will deliver you when nothing but a miracle will - do you believe that this morning [Music] when you've cried in the

Paul see they're shouting with the mouths of us he delivered Oh [Music] [Music] just believe he'll deliver you [Music] with nothing much [Music] [Applause] as a little girl she's three years old she was born she's had probably I don't know four or five operations in the heart or stomach just all kinds of complications and the last thing was they they found that the blood that normally goes into the heart and the heart pumps it to the rest of the body was not working properly because the blood flow was going the opposite direction and so she she was thank you she was had to go back into the hospital because they had to do they had to hook her up to all these machines this this week and and while the machine was doing all of her you know rerouting her blood so that her body would function up early they cleaned up her heart and operated and so the flow would reverse itself and go the right direction it said I'll forget how many weeks four days I forget what it was she would be in the hospital and then recovery she's just been a miracle baby ever since she was born we've played different times for her and God has been gracious to her well Tuesday when I had eye surgery Monday on my left eye and for cataract surgery and I had to stay there and go back the next day to the VA so when we get out fall and I just five minutes away was the hospital where she had been was being operated on so we we drove over there and they were in the waiting room when she was in surgery at that time and so we had prayer with my with my nephew and his wife and her parents were there and we got to meet them and talk a while and had prayer and my sister came and we prayed we prayed together as a family and just trusting God brother Paul led in prayer and we just believed you know and I kept getting these texts you know she's she's woke up she's off the machine she's breathing normally and then yesterday I get a text yesterday morning she went home today [Applause] thank you brother this is real life I got a real close to my throat so you have to keep it I'm not supposed to do anything rambunctious because of the stupid thing here you know they say don't lift five pounds for two weeks how do I get out of bed you know what are they what are they talking about so so we're just so thankful for her God's grace and His mercy mite the doctors are amazed they just don't know and everything they told her totally there's anybody like you she's just a bubbly thing like she just full of energy and was so thankful for that so her name is Evelyn if you remember her name just ask God that just continue to bless her and be with her we appreciate you doing that they're happy to be here this morning it's a black that sister Loretta could come with us today and be able to be here

morning and did not I said I'm not gonna get in get in any heavy preaching and running around and acting to my case normally dude so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna very politely speak and see what he'll because I believe he's still a miracle worker I believe we can change lives right here this morning like you to turn with me if you would this morning to second Timothy chapter 3 bring your greetings this morning from literal life assembly by the Paul and the Saints there and ask you to remember our daughter Sharon this morning she's under the weather not feeling well so she couldn't make it to service this morning's off second Timothy chapter 3 beginning at verse 1 very familiar to us know this also of in the last days perilous times shall come how many believe we're living in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such Heavenly Father we want to thank you this morning for the opportunity to be in the house of God what an honour Lord I believe your prophet said it's the greatest honor in all the world to come to the house of God we appreciate the privilege of being here this morning we ask you to bless now this little service this morning Lord remainder part of it thank you for what's been accomplished already the songs that worship Lord we have had a wonderful time now Lord we just want you to speak to us today Lord just open our hearts dropped a little nugget in you'd have to be their God and touch our hearts God make them what they what they should be Lord and may every need be met this morning I pray in Jesus name Amen the church said god bless you you may be seated so I'd like to I'd like to speak on this this morning that the hour that we're living in the Bible said that though this also in last days perilous times shall come and I in the in the Greek died gallant that word perilous there is trying trying seasons i thought lord have mercy I think every one of us have been under trials and testings from time to time so I'd like to speak on the thought though of of you know I'll just title this it's a crazy world any complaints for the title what am I doing wrong guys Kinect can I turn my little mic off yeah be alright no no okay well just watch me because if I get loud I can't get so I subtitle this okay it's a crazy world is a title but I'll subtitle this how to live sanely in an insane world that'd be alright that's your mom your wife you treat her right everything good hello hey I'm talking to you that's better I think maybe we should move this one out of the way now with that move there he'll probably alright that's thank you sir every time I come here somebody has to come up here take care of me so let me get back to my thought because I told Sam I was only gonna be about an hour long and he said that cheery sing for 45 minutes and the preachers but you know what he thinks of my preaching doesn't it but I understood that because I like everything and and I and I like to be short I really do but when all those years I didn't learned that and I should have learned it but now I'm Oh be what should have done on the years quickly the thought how to become how to live scene lien and then in same order we know that it's no floow2 us or no surprise to us that people are going insane there it used to be some kind of common sense some kind of normalcy about about life and about people and the way they think you know there used to be normal thinking people on the earth that that rational and they made proper decisions and they they had respect for others didn't matter who they were they respected each other and they you know you didn't have to lock your doors you didn't have to do all these kind of things but you better not do that now because it's a crazy world you know what's on there but but you know anymore it's just I want it as it goes by week after week and month after month and I just think Lord when is it ever gonna end and then I think of that scripture that it lays there in the scriptures has said they'll pray even so come quickly Lord Jesus and I've often pondered on that Scripture I want to help what would make us pray come quickly Lord Jesus do you know what if it gets any worse I don't know I don't think I want to be around that long I really don't I I don't think I want to stand again a crazy the house world that he it is it's getting worse all the time listen to what the other band said in a message called Christ is identified this is the first slide the same in all generations 1964 he said but the Bible said it'd be that way and even even to men it's just their their their changed see it's going to get worse in another if the world would stand another 50 years the whole world would be totally insane you know how many years ago he said that 55 years ago this day the scripture is fulfilled hey man look at this sanity he says I'm finishing the quote from 40 from 20 years ago till this time see and then another another quote here from from God provided place of worship 1965 he said look at all the televisions the things getting getting these fictitious things in order it'll-it'll come a time I predict that people will be completely totally insane the world will be and and I've got to say in my little time on earth it has evolved so far down the road I'm amazed at what I hear our leaders our politicians that are supposed to be standing for our our country and our people and insane things that are being said and adopted and forced upon us and I wonder Lord Corsa go ahead it's crazy see he said look at all the televisions and things getting getting these fictitious things in order to become a time I predict the people will be completely totally insane the world will be the Bible speaks of such hideous sights as they show in movies today and some prehistoric creatures eggs that lived in the earth so many thousands or millions of years ago hatched and come forth that that's that's just a minor thing all those horror movies and thing you see in hideous sites you see that's just a minor thing to what's coming or locusts with hair like women and teeth like lions why the world will be completely totally insane it's not just about about one degree from it now show that show that that's slide I got this off the internet it's not real good but this is kind of what he's looking at it'll have it'll have locusts are we're not showing slides that I've missed the slides on to our side you haven't seen you slides yet okay oh we don't it's under image images okay don't worry about that here we go they're like women teeth like lions face like a man tailed it stings like a scorpion I got it all she had brought just in case no I did that's not it's not about but when he talks about these things here now he's mentioning all these things here in this these these come from from the book of revelations chapter 9 if you want to turn there will go to revelations chapter 9 I just read a little bit and let me just preface this by saying this let me just say this you don't want to be here with his hands you do not want to be on planet earth when this happens all right revelations chapter 9 verse 1 and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit it's Lucifer that Satan and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as a smoke of a great furnace and the Sun in the air were darkened by the reason of the smoke of the pit and their name out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as a scorpion of the earth have power and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither the green thing neither any tree but only those men that have not the seal of God in the forth only those men they have not the Holy Ghost the seal of God in their forehead and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented 5 months and their torment was as a torment of a scorpion that he when he strike as a man and in those days shall meet a crown of gold and their faces were faces of men and they had hair like women and teeth like teeth like lions and and they had breastplates and they were and the breast plates of iron in his sound of their wings would make the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle and they they had a tail like a scorpion and they were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men for five months and he had a king in him they had a king over them the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue was Abaddon but in the Greek tongue hath a name apollon listen church listen to me one more time you don't want to be here whatever it takes you don't want to be here then you need to get serious about your walk with God you need to get serious about your life and make sure your heart is surrendered to him these things are real and they're coming and the movies are preparing the mindset of the children to see these things as they look upon them there it's pretty dark but I'm sorry you know give you the best but that's but look what they see in movies and they call them you know they're for kids pg-13 oh that one's got to be okay they're preparing their minds because they're gonna get in this fictitious world when these things are coming and they're gonna wonder is this a when they put those goggles on will they call that thing and they what do they call that yeah reality right they won't know if they're dreaming they won't know if they're if this is real is this a movie what's going on but it won't be no movie they're gonna feel the sting they tell me I've never got stung by a scorpion but I've come close they tell me that's worse than a snake bite sometimes the poison and what it does and how it hurts how it follows up like that so we got a watch now you can see by these quotes the Prophet predicted that these things would come in these last days in church we are here we're living in a world that has gone totally insane decisions that are being made you look at abortion how it started it used to be years many years ago I can remember when when a mother's life was in danger then the decision could be made they they would it would take the baby and save the mother and and then they've decided well you know in extreme cases of a woman being raped or something like that and in Roe vs. Wade came in which was the abortion law to legalized abortions and the woman's choice then whether she wanted to keep a baby or not keep a baby and then and then partial birth abortion came in and then if you saw the news back of two or three months ago the governor of Virginia they declared a law there brought a law into into reality there that if a mother had the baby then this law would permit them to keep the baby comfortable this is a baby now a life not partial not not pre this is this has evolved into this place that if this child is born they make the baby comfortable until the doctor and the the woman can the mother can have a conversation or whether or not she wants to keep I'm serious that's not abortion that's murder and it's been all the way along they just have made us see it but I want you to know that's not this isn't the age of of where this all came from you go all the way back to Exodus chapter 3 and you find where Pharaoh told the midwives of Israel to take all the mill children that were born all the men children and kill them drowned them and let the women I'll live because they were afraid Israel was going to rise up and have more people on the earth and take over the country so he already brought a form of abortion him in his day and it was full term abortion if you please but it's gotten worse I'll tell you it's just you look at it and it's insane and yet you treat an animal bad somebody see you swat your dog or keep your dog or something like that and bunny they'll put you in jail faster you animal rights will come down on you and you'll just look like you just I don't know why I did and just I know he bit three of my children but I love animals not gonna be wrong I'm not suggesting you kick any animals well I'm just suggesting this it's so the thinking and and how they're doing it it makes no sense it's insane you look at the the game gay right movie that used to be in the closet and then they one-by-one started coming out of the closet and then some of them begin to get prominent jobs news casting and whether people in and movie stars now and all of them is coming out of the closet you can tell they watch a show or anything anymore that that doesn't have some kind of a connotation toward that that way and then you better not say anything about it buddy they'll they'll block you up they'll put you away they'll have me every kind of right coming against you God has an order to things but they just thumb their nose that God we live in an insane world we don't we looked at people today you don't know if it's a he or she or in it I had to bite my tongue sometimes I just had a fella walk in front of me he had a full beard he had a dress on I forget what color his hair was now this is back a few years back I come that close but I'm saying but you know you don't dare say that you employee employers have to hire get in trouble if they don't hire in churches they've even got laws now that if you don't have any of your bylaws or something to protect you they can come right in here and end up sitting on the boards they need to be on a board all right so Ward's board they need me scrubbed out real good that's the Gospel according to brother John you look at profiling the the racial profiling that goes on you don't know what to call people I mean he used to be the black community is to be the Negroes and then they were the blacks and then they were other I guess they're still maybe african-american I just don't know what to say you you're afraid to open your mouth and say anything cuz somebody's gonna get out here yo you know he made a slur back about 50 years ago fifty years ago it wasn't a slur it's crazy you just don't know what to do the media and Hollywood have blessed you for being a Christian they'll they'll nail us to the cross for doing that again but you better not say nothing against their what they're standing for it makes no sense I mean I don't know sometimes you just don't say anything because you're afraid of offending some there's gonna be offended people let me tell you this coming seems like we're under check as believers on every side but second Timothy if you what think of a scripture second Timothy 3:12 said this 2nd Timothy 3:12 said ye and all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution shall suffer persecution it's not new when you look at the Apostle Paul and what he had to go through you read his testimony his life story 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 if you would beginning at verse 25 tells a little bit about his perils 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse 25 said thrice was i beaten with rods not compared this to your walk compare this to your life have you gone through this yet 2nd Corinthians 11:25 thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the deep that means he was in the ocean in journeyings often in perils of waters and perils of robbers and perils of my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils went to sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness and watchings often in hunger in thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches I mean he had a hard time but nobody said it was going to be easy serving serving Christ people think sometimes I had a lady just complained about everything because it wasn't we wasn't preaching what she liked and things weren't going were away and we wouldn't straighten her husband up so she was always complaining I never had any problems until I came to this message I believe that I can't believe that the problem is no you didn't want to believe you want to live your own way and do your own thing and still still keep it on here but when you when you look at puffle all the things that he went through you talk about spiritual pressure being among wolves that are in sheep's clothing gurgi bees Twilight and you don't mind being I'm taking my time and and I'm trying to talk slow because I don't want to get too excited but I am excited he was 12 26 and 27 said whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying yet once more I was shaking out the earth only but also not just out here now now we're coming home now we're coming within in the heavenly realm things are gonna be shaking up and they had been sure the Bible talks about a great falling away and I said for years and years and years I said that's not just people out here in denominations that's coming right in our ranks because you gotta have something to fall away from first and that right and we've seen it happen here over the last few years there's been a great falling away that's come we couldn't have believed it we wouldn't want to believe it see who's voice then shook it said in this world verse 27 yet once more signifying the removing of those things that that are shaken as the things are that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain and what brother branham say this little bride will not be deceived we have a firm foundation we're something that we can stand upon something they've been sure something we can depend upon we're not we're not only got got got to deal with the world and the things that are out here in the world but now we've got to deal with all this as going on around us within our own ranks those that have fallen away from the message and coming against it and and and and you're trying to get get us to walk away ourselves there there there are some who even think everybody ought to do things the way they do it you ought to preach that guy preach believe what I believe sing like I sing walk like I walk talk like I talk well that's good but what if you're wrong well I ain't wrong bless God careful that every men's would be a lion gods the truth there's an absolute and you're not it like that you know what I'll keep that one no here's an absolute in your not even thank you lord oh my I love him don't you hey hey man so so we're not going to be with all that we're looking at I like what the president said our president said here back I guess it's been a month ago or so with the State of the Union when he was talking about the country and he made this statement right right at the end of the the address that I was listening to he said we he said we will never be a socialist country he said we were born free and we're going to remain free not love America and I know the Prophet said don't pray for it I know he said it's gone and I you can see that but I'm still in America I'm still thankful that I was born in America I'm still thankful for the truth that we at one time embraced and believed in but when he said that I thought you know what that's true I'm free this message came and it set me free set me free from denominations it set me free from news I Ayala jeez and all I I don't even know if that's a word and a sudden sorry English teachers ideologies I don't know maybe I got it somewhere sometimes I'd like to be big and think I don't ok so just look I'm sorry I I feel sometimes like people just don't don't want us to be free but when you look at the Word of God and what has it done for us we got freedom to worship got no soldiers back there telling us we can't worship this one not yet nobody's saying you can't do that freedom to praise we can worship God like we feel like we want to worship God amen because we're in a free country freedom to walk this freedom way the song says freedom to sing freedom to dance I've been given a second chance I'm not going back to the enemy's Kingdom I've tasted freedom I'm free this morning Church nobody's gonna tell me what I can and can't do or believe outside the Word of God you know you if you sit here this morning and you're believing God sent a prophet and you believe what that prophet talked you're a blessed person because nobody can tell you any different nobody can take away those freedoms in those truth you're free you should be happy are you happy well notify your face that always works even in the German churches I've gone that it works John 8:36 said this if the Sun therefore to make you free you're free indeed we're free and it's manifesting time the fruits around the vine the lovely ones coming in babies we have a right to worship God and be free under no man's bondage I feel good this I feel like I I'm a somebody I wish I could sing hit little song alright so how do we live saintly in an insane world what kind of wrap this all up how do we live saintly in this insane world we can't stay home and lock the doors I guess you could try pay your bills online and get your monthly check the bank and now they got grocery store that will deliver groceries restaurants that will deliver me but what about church well I'll livestream okay what about forsake not the assembling of yourselves together well I'm gonna have prayer meeting in my house this week come on over to my little two-bedroom apartment yeah maybe we get in it more so we can't just call in a hole somewhere and say it's all over so how do we do how do we live saintly in an insane world and I hope you'll just listen carefully I want to read from Ephesians chapter 6 first year seasons chapter 6 beginning in verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that's the complete word now she may be able to withstand the evil day that's that's today and have having done all having done all to stand stand therefore what do we do well John what do we do Stan uh-huh but don't tell me what to do stand the song says stand for holiness stand for righteousness I don't know the tune and be counted among them that rain with him you stand when you stand your stand with your friends begone Stan Stan Stan I don't know Stan when you're all alone and believe he show us what do we do having done all to stand stand you don't have to perform you don't have to stand up and say that's all align you all shut up you stand because the longer you stand there the grittier testimony becomes that you're one of them that doesn't revile back when he's reviled against all right let's go to let's go to Daniel chapter 3 you with me just a few things here want a background Nebuchadnezzar who was the king of Babylon heeey he had a dream and in this dream he saw things and when he woke up the next morning he couldn't remember couldn't get it straight in his mind he's never had a dream you couldn't remember it you know it was a great dream but you could you when you have a great dream so he had the first thing you want to do is go back to sleep you don't to leave that I hate it when the alarm goes off er don't go off anymore hardly for me but I hate it when I have to get up you know and I've had a dream and it's time to get up and so he comes to all of us people is there's musicians and magicians and all the soothsayers and all the sheriff's and the princes and the governors and I've had this dream he says and whoever can tell me the dream I'm gonna make you a very rich man and he's a little king that's wonderful just tell us what you dreamed we'll tell you what it means and he said no I don't remember what I dreamed and he got frustrated with him and said unless you tell me what I dream I'm gonna take your heads off and when Daniel heard about it Daniel spoke up and said give me a chance so let me pray about it I'll come back so he goes off and he prays and he comes back to Nebuchadnezzar and he gives him the dream tells him what he dreamed even left out I mean he even told him parts that the king could rent out I told him what it meant and so in verse one here that that I had to pull up here in verse one here it said in Daniel three verses well I'm gonna read one two six but first one said he never connects with the king made a golden image in an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits and breath leer I've excused and set it up on a the plane of Dera and the province of Babel and so here he is he has a stream and and and and this is what a dream you got that you got that image of I got to do these things off the internet once I had brother Lonnie's slides on you got that one it's a it's it's the king it's the image of Daniel you got the other one how did you do that and now you can't get this one that's not it there now you got to make that thing real big real big blow that thing to pieces can you see it all right back down the back anyways this is what he dreamed so he begins to tell him he said said King what you dream in verse 2 of chapter 3 I'm sorry let me back up here first chapter 2 verse 46 chapter 2 verse 46 after Daniel did this told him all this he said he said this is your image he said the head of gold is your kingdom it's Babylon the breastplate of silver is the Medes and the Persians another kingdom to follow the thighs of brass is Greece legs of iron he told him what they represented he said it's wrong then he said the feet in the clay himr he said that's what's going to come in this end time two divided Nations which was the United States and Russia remember back in the 60s when Khrushchev and Eisenhower met remember that Khrushchev took his shoe off and pounded on the table at that meeting brother branham spoke and said that's it said that's that iron and clay they won't mix brought it right down into modern time we're at when he did that never Canasta fell on his face and worship Daniel he literally fell down and worshiped Daniel you can read it I'm gonna read it to you Daniel 246 Daniel 246 he said then king nebuchadnezzar ii fell upon his face and worship daniel and you talk about a red flag you don't do that you worship God and God only God is a jealous God nebuchadnezzar fell in his face and worship daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him and what he did he built this image he built this statute and the statute of the land says was was of daniel now this is hitting pretty close to home with this message we don't worship the prophet church it's wrong to worship the profit but we worship the one the Prophet led us to you hallelujah you get in the Prophet worshiping you got a problem I had a friend of mine one time used to go preach for him quite a bit and we were buddies I thought we were I saw her I guess she'll contact each other once more haaa but he told me one time you said brother John said we would say that's house I've gone to preach a meeting for him he's with church and he said I got to go somewhere I gotta do something cuz I want to ride along yeah so we're right along he looks at me in the car he says brother John said he said I believe brother Branham is the Holy Ghost so he told me it's right in the car not a clear blue sky and I said he took me back I just I said what did you say I thought he was joking he's not believing of the random was it is a Holy Ghost I said well why do you believe that he said well who is it in this day that has led us and guide us into all truth these are the profit so I breed the profits the holy ghost I looked at him I said well brother I said you can believe whatever you want to believe but I don't believe that so I looked at her ready I said what's that do with our meeting this coming up tonight Oh got nothing to do with that he said no that's fine you just come preaching no problem but you better be careful God is a jealous God even in Revelations when John fell to worship the angel picked him up and said no worship God the Angels lead us to the word I'm so glad for the angel but I can't worship the angel and standing in that crowd as you look at it here and you want me to continue to read it I can I can read it but you know it already Nebuchadnezzar he had gathered this is verse 2 of chapter 3 chapter 3 Daniel 3 3 and verse 2 said and then never can answer the king he gathered together all the princes and governors and captains and judges some treasures and counselors and sheriff's and all the rulers of the problems to come together to the dedication of the image which never can measure the king had set up and when they all got together then he told him at the command everyone's gonna fall down and worship and when they heard the sound of all the musical instruments everybody bounced down and worships this golden it was an image of Daniel and everybody when they heard that sound everybody bow down except for three they didn't bend they didn't bow they didn't burn but the ones this room and the furnace did they went bye-bye quick what did they do what did the heap of children do when it come time to make this tough decision they did nothing but Stan you don't have to defend this you don't have to argue this you don't have to debate this you just stand for truth everybody else around he's falling everybody else is crushing under the pressure and doing the things the world wants them to do and the devil wants to know they're just he's got them's like puppets on the string it pulls this and does this and everything but the bride is just standing we're looking for her second coming having them all the stand stand there for I love it church oh there's such a truth so what do we do we do nothing they just stood there they stood for it thou shalt have no other gods before thee there's three things I want to end with three keys to being successful as a Christian in 2019 this is for me number one I believe these things are must must be filled with the Holy Ghost we must be filled with the Holy Ghost Romans 8 verse 11 said it like this but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken that means to be make alive your mortal body that's his bodies here by the spirit that dwelleth in him Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption you see I like it but the man talks about that seal he talks about going behind the veil into the presence of the Shekinah glory you saying you let the curtain fall he says it seals the world out and it seals you in are you see over you just keep going through this land you're just standing that's all you're doing there's something different about that person something different about that guy something could differ about that woman they wonder what it is the last time for the berry took his group over there George brother George I'm sorry George Smith took his group over to Israel I've been at the last time here the time before that here a while back brother Jack Duff did he tell you the story about about the the guide did you tell you the story about the guy brother brother Jack brother Jack was on that on that tour with with with with George Smith and he'd think a lot of his church went but the guy pulled brother George off to the side and he said he said I've been a guide for I forget what he said 34 years he said I've seen a lot of groups come through they said what is it about you women but your women about your people that's different and brother George said well we're Christians no no no no no he said I've had every kind of church people go through here I've had Pentecostals I've been Baptists I've had you know Methodist I've had all there's something different you're women dressed like our women that are that are Orthodox what is it about that in brother George said well we believe God sent a prophet he looked at him and said a prophet he says you believe in prophets don't you George said he said yeah he said well I'll tell you what he said I want to give you this little tape this little I've taped Edie I don't what was one of the messages you take it and listen to it so that guy took it home that night and he came back to the next to hand couldn't hardly wait to get a hold of other Georgian he told him he said he said I listened to that tape and he said I had a dream I don't remember everything to went on in the dream I'm sorry I don't brother Jack would tell you the story and he said in this dream this man came to my house and expound two things and told me things and he going on and he said I'd never never thought about it was said that's that that man's a prophet he said there he said what he said you got any pictures towards his I got picture say pull out a picture by the random and his face got white he said that's the man that came to my house you think God's not real you just stand for what's right makes you feel religious done oh my goodness church I got two more things I got a close two more things the second thing I'd say is a must you've got to have a consistent prayer life the Bible says pray without ceasing if you don't have anything else to pray for pray for a little fun to any family pray for one another pray for your pastor pray for your family pray for your loved ones pray for this little bride James 5 and verse 16 said the fervent the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much in a message called this is on a slide number five what what does out here this was 1959 I like this other branch said this I might sing too much I might preach too much I might shout too much I might cry too much but I'll never pray too much and then in seed seed is not air but the shucks and he's 65 he said you might eat too much oh you might drink too much you might laugh too much you might walk too much I might add you might talk too much unquote but you'll never pray too much I would that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without doubt or wrath amen the third thing that I'd say is a must for living as a successful Christian life is we got to keep feeding on the word you know what happens if you go without eating too long you get weak hello you get weak what do we do - stay strong read your Bible every day and pray that's what he said in the scripture and I'm closing John 5 and verse 51 he said this I love this word I love this word I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat this bread he shall live forever the bread that I shall give him is my flesh which I give for the life of the world fixing to have communion tonight it's a symbol of partaking of the body and the blood of Jesus Christ you know what a privilege that is to be poor taker with the sacraments this do in remembrance of me not transfigured in anything but American remembrance of what Christ did for you what he gave for you verse 53 said the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily I say to you except you eat my flesh the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up the last day for my flesh is meat and read him my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I and I in him let's stand together and bow our hearts I want to pray for you you can pray for one another what do we do your heads behind your eyes closed what do we do if we get caught it's one of these spirits you know I I'm paraphrasing a quote right now to you paraphrasing it but brother branham said that the closest paraphrasing we can get to being the most spiritual we can be is just one step from insanity because we're dealing in the spirit world before I pray I want to close with this quote in demonology he said many times you can see a person may be of insanity now they may be yet a converted person filled with the Holy Ghost and yet be totally insane see that's right it has nothing to do with a soul it's a tormentor it's something that torments so you may know someone today who was going through the most hideous things and torments and yet you know they've been a good person and they love God you need to pray for you need to pray for one another everly father just closing this quietness now even though we live in this crazy world we have a whole beyond the river we have a LifeCare Lamb of God that we didn't deserve it but you shared your life with us and we're able to partake of that life and Lord we thank you for that I want to thank you today Lord for your word for your profit for brother Sam and the Saints here this little assembly god I love coming here I love the people and Lord they're good people and they see they see the insanity that's going on in Lourdes if we focused on that we'd get so discouraged but we're not focusing on that let the world go let the world do whatever they're going to do those we're living in heavenly places in Christ Jesus we walk through these doors and Lord there's something that happens to us we're transformed and we we worship and we praise you and we sing and we we hear the precious Word of God Lord were so thankful for that I'm asking today god they're gird up every heart that's in this place is small don't let a one of them Lord be deceived don't let a one of them be lost Lord I pray you'll fill everyone from the oldest to the youngest from the grandmas and grandmas the mums and dads and the teenagers and the young couples to the children filled with the Holy Ghost God let them be on fire Lord let's her prayer life be breath the Lord just bless him this morning as they prepare their hearts for communion tonight - brother Sam Lord Callan's soldier walk to Lord in his daddy's shoes bar stood faithful with him or these years and now our dear brothers gone to his reward and our brother Sam is standing here Lord with his little family his mother loved ones here Lord all around him in the church bless him lift him up Lord encourage him give me what he stands in the of God I let every heart and every life be blessed God

knees and fears [Music] Oh [Music] I [Music] a chair [Music] richest oh I [Music] Oh God [Music] just as I will receive will welcome pardon me [Music] Oh Oh God I [Music] let's see this last verse again you notice there every one of these verses it starts out just as I am there's not one of us not one can make ourselves fit fit to come to him but he provides all that we need him to come to him and he provides in order to take care of and make us fit to stand in his presence it's his work it's his work and at the latter part of every one of these verses old Lamb of God that's the focus just as I am but focused on the Lamb of God the one who is there our lamb for our sin for our atonement the one who paid the price for us the one who made a way for you and I or Lamb of God I come not a church the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ all mine let's sing this again together this verse just and [Music] this is what you do [Music] people [Music] I you'll heal me O Lord and I shall be healed me and I will be save me and I will be saying [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Applause] [Music] and I will [Music] we'll be [Music] pray [Music] let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word this morning Lord it's so true that [Music] we not only see it around us we've since the pressure sword Lord it's all around us as it's recorded in Psalms 27 enemies gathered all around Lord we feel we feel pressure not just from the world we feel pressure all around us from within our ranks and on and on Lord your God as you brought it from Lord insanity that's out there you dealt with things Lord Jesus right here that Lord our message is not exempt from it but the message never produced those things our God Lord would realized that certain things that we see and we face Lord we know it by the term of fanaticism but yet that in itself Lord God it speaks of the truth then we have been gathered to Lord if it wasn't for that Lord God it would cause us to wonder but father we know that Lord in you is our stain no wonder the scripture would speak to us say Lord in this time of trouble you would hide us in your pavilion in the secret of your tabernacle David would say now I am set up on a rock and my head is lifted up above mine enemies yeah I will sing praises of joy in the tabernacle of the Lord certainly not joy was not something that originated from what he's seen or from what he felt but from where by the rock that he was placed on that his head was lifted to see beyond all of this that is around all the pressure all the tests all the trials we see the end is here we see Lord just any moment we're going to be changed in a twinkling of an eye Lord God to look beyond Lord and with anticipation looking for your coming Lord God believing Lord God by the coming of the Holy Ghost in our soul that we are a part of that coming Lord we're looking for you this is the Blessed hope of the Church of the Living God Lord even as we would assemble around here together later this evening Lord God to partake of the Lord's Supper it is a witness Lord we are doing this in remembrance you're god of a work Lord that you've done in our life of a fellowship a communion that we have mourned with you it is a symbol or called and Lord Jesus as we would take it Lord we are worshipping you thanking you for the work not that you just have done but the work that the Holy Ghost is doing with her sword or declaring we are here looking for the second coming of the Lord for this is a promise to us as believers it's a promise that all believers believe that we will see there is a literal Jesus that we will behold and be caught up Lord God to meet him in that place that is reserved oh god how we think you Father Lord that you have alerted and illuminated our hearts and our lives Lord God to make us ready by the seal of God Lord if there be one here this morning that's not ready to meet you lord I pray that they would settle that Lord God this morning because Lord were not even guaranteed another moment Lord may they see it Lord not out of fear but see it father God out of that alive that's abled now to be lived and lived for you Lord a life that you express your life through to where that life can say it's known I that do with the works but it's Christ that dwelleth in me he's the one that doeth the works all granted Lord Jesus father bless for the John sister Loretta - sherry Lord your God we thank you Father that or Jesus for friends for brothers and sisters Lord that have stood and continue to stand Lord God Lord for this glorious gospel we pray that Lord God that you would just Lord refresh and strengthen them Lord I pray that God you watch over as Lord as we would come Lord to be gathered here at the appropriate time once again we love you Father thank you for making away Lord we ask it now Lord you would go with us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you love the Lord and Lord willing it's 1 o'clock right now let's let's aim for 4 o'clock and we'll I think that that should allow us to start probably a 4 o'clock we're going to start and move on into communion taking the Lord's Supper and then foot washing and if your your heart your life is right with God we're more than welcome to be here to be a part of that community it's a wonderful opportunity wonderful time a man to give witness and worship the Lord you know if I'll say it like this if there's something that's not going to get it right get it right don't let it linger get it right brother Brown preached the message Jubilee year in 1954 I
