[40:10] brother aaron if you'll go ahead and
[40:12] make his way forward
[40:16] and uh there's some things to just share
[40:18] with you
[40:20] also remember i told you
[40:22] on thursday here um
[40:26] sister
[40:27] sister linda
[40:30] sister linda cavillo cavillo my my aunt
[40:36] she's been going home on june 17th
[40:44] god is good
[40:46] and i think i don't know to the exact
[40:48] day but that's very close to six months
[40:51] that she's been
[40:53] from that double lung transplant in the
[40:55] hospital and then she just had went last
[40:58] last friday
[41:00] she just had went to rehab and they
[41:02] didn't know how long that was going to
[41:04] be
[41:05] but because of her strength or the
[41:07] strength that she has in doing
[41:09] everything they went ahead and announced
[41:11] to her
[41:12] you're going home on the 17th
[41:14] i tell you what that's just an effect
[41:18] of the presence of god
[41:20] amen
[41:22] that's a testimony it's a miracle
[41:24] and um i know that
[41:27] it's been truly the prayers of the
[41:28] saints
[41:29] amen it's nothing less than a miracle
[41:32] amen just hearing the testimony also
[41:35] sister miranda here on on thursday as
[41:38] well and i know there's other
[41:39] testimonies but
[41:41] these testimonies right now just so
[41:43] stand out to me even more so because
[41:46] sometimes there's things that doesn't
[41:47] always happen
[41:49] instantaneous like that
[41:52] sometimes it's
[41:53] it's a journey
[41:55] but nonetheless
[41:57] it's still faith
[41:59] it's still faith
[42:01] so we just brother aaron if you'll come
[42:10] this morning
[42:11] just want to give you a quick update on
[42:14] the the project gonna be taking place
[42:16] out here
[42:17] uh lord willing that will be starting
[42:19] tomorrow
[42:21] and uh
[42:22] it'll be a blessing to have that done
[42:25] uh that portion of the project it's
[42:27] gonna look a little bit different here
[42:31] the next time we we return
[42:33] um whether it be thursday or sunday just
[42:37] keep an eye on your
[42:38] email or facebook or whatever if there's
[42:41] some issues or whatever in the week with
[42:43] weather
[42:46] we may have to may have to cancel
[42:48] service thursday we're not real sure but
[42:51] if need be
[42:53] some extra time is needed
[42:56] i believe it's
[42:57] going to be taken three days so monday
[42:59] tuesday
[43:00] lord willing should be complete by
[43:02] wednesday but if by chance it's not then
[43:04] obviously uh
[43:06] we may need to cancel the service
[43:08] thursday and then uh we should have a
[43:10] beautiful sidewalk an entryway come
[43:13] sunday
[43:15] uh it's pretty exciting i just wanna i
[43:17] wanna thank all of you for
[43:19] uh your generosity and during this time
[43:22] and being able to make projects like
[43:24] this happen and
[43:27] not only
[43:28] for us but for visitors as well you know
[43:31] it'll make it easier for
[43:33] exiting
[43:34] out the door with those that have
[43:36] walkers wheelchairs things like that
[43:38] it'll
[43:39] definitely be more accommodating

[43:49] time we took the offering for the
[43:51] project

[43:58] that's outstanding a group this size i
[44:01] mean it's
[44:03] i think it's wonderful
[44:04] and uh i believe the lord can multiply

[44:11] at this point
[44:14] that's about really all i have for you

[48:20] i'd like to read in zechariah chapter 4
[48:22] this morning
[48:24] just a little
[48:26] further thought
[48:30] some of the things we've just been
[48:32] looking at with faith
[48:44] say it's good to have the visitors here
[48:46] with us god bless you
[48:48] let's see sister linda
[48:50] mr angie and different ones god bless
[48:52] you amen
[48:55] mr mary bell god bless you good to have
[48:57] you here with us too
[48:59] i get in trouble when i start calling
[49:00] names because if i overlook someone it's
[49:02] very easy to do that
[49:04] even here with times i have to ask the
[49:06] deacons and say did you see brother
[49:08] so-and-so or sister so-and-so because
[49:10] everything's on a level they can hide
[49:11] behind somebody
[49:13] but it's good to see each and every one
[49:14] of you amen it's good to be together in
[49:17] it
[49:18] amen zechariah chapter 4
[49:20] and verse 1
[49:23] and the angel
[49:25] that talked with me came again
[49:28] and waked me as a man that is awakened
[49:34] out of his sleep
[49:36] now he wasn't sleeping but he's letting
[49:38] us know the angel came
[49:41] and he waked
[49:42] me and he waked me as a man that is
[49:46] awakened out of his sleep
[49:48] and he said to me what seest thou
[49:51] i said i have looked and behold a
[49:53] candlestick all of gold
[49:55] with a ball upon the top of it and his
[49:58] seven lamps they're on and seven pipes
[50:00] to the seven lamps which are
[50:03] upon the top thereof
[50:05] and two olive trees buy it one upon the
[50:07] right side side of the bowl and the
[50:09] other upon the left side thereof so i
[50:12] answered and spake to the angel that
[50:14] talked with me saying
[50:16] what are these my lord
[50:17] then the angel that talked with me
[50:19] answered and said unto me
[50:22] knowest not what these be
[50:24] i said no my lord then he answered and
[50:27] spake unto me saying
[50:29] this is the word of the lord unto
[50:32] zerubbabel saying
[50:34] not by might nor by power but by my
[50:39] spirit saith
[50:41] the lord of hosts
[50:43] who art thou o great mountain
[50:46] before zerubbabel thou shalt become a
[50:50] plain
[50:51] he shall bring forth the headstone
[50:53] thereof with shoutings crying
[50:56] grace grace
[50:58] unto it amen may god bless the reading
[51:01] of the word as you're being seated
[51:04] didn't mean to have you setting standing
[51:05] up and down
[51:08] maybe you'll be able to say you got your
[51:09] exercise for the day
[51:12] but we've been looking at a thought here
[51:15] god has just been moving in our lives
[51:18] and just speaking to us here
[51:20] about the pursuit
[51:22] of your need and we all
[51:25] are gathered here
[51:26] because we do have needs
[51:29] and yet
[51:31] we've come here because there's also
[51:34] the purpose that we have in coming to
[51:37] the house of god and that's to hear from
[51:40] god
[51:41] there's a we're not just coming here to
[51:44] fulfill a duty
[51:46] we're not come here just to fulfill a
[51:48] time
[51:49] we don't come here just to say well i've
[51:52] done
[51:53] my religious duty of the week
[51:56] there's a greater there's a greater
[51:57] reason that we're coming together here
[52:00] there's lives to be touched
[52:03] delivered
[52:04] saved
[52:05] filled with the holy ghost
[52:07] and there's lives within all of that
[52:09] also
[52:10] questions to be answered directions to
[52:13] be ministered to discernment of of our
[52:16] hearts and how god would just come in in
[52:18] a very special way
[52:20] that that were steps that continued to
[52:23] be made in a forward direction
[52:26] and as we were looking at that last week
[52:28] of how that even when jairus
[52:31] started out and it was faith that drove
[52:33] him
[52:34] when hearing
[52:35] of of the lord jesus was present
[52:38] he moved to that place to
[52:41] knowing that jesus was presented bro it
[52:43] it it caused him to go beyond
[52:46] every fear or doubt or question that was
[52:50] there of what will happen you know if i
[52:53] go on and i go after the lord jesus as
[52:56] ruler of the synagogue when that need
[52:59] arose with his daughter
[53:01] that need took precedence over every
[53:05] other thought
[53:07] and he moved out and yet whom we know
[53:08] even when he moved out they came to a
[53:10] place and they told him and said
[53:13] when his daughter had passed why don't
[53:16] trouble the master any any further
[53:18] your daughter's dead
[53:20] but the lord jesus heard that
[53:23] and he spoke to jairus
[53:25] jairus didn't even turn to him but the
[53:28] lord jesus heard it and he encouraged
[53:30] him he strengthened
[53:33] the faith that was already there for
[53:34] that need letting it be known to jairus
[53:37] but i believe it's greater for you and i
[53:41] that when god has put upon our heart
[53:43] there's a need that no matter what
[53:46] circumstance or situation arises it was
[53:50] god who placed that need upon our heart
[53:52] and before we could ever have a need he
[53:56] already
[53:57] is the answer for that need
[54:00] so between here and there like we were
[54:01] looking at that that statement or that
[54:03] quote out of life is the healer between
[54:06] here and there what takes place the
[54:09] angel of the lord moving from the
[54:12] circumstance of where like that little
[54:14] blind boy who entered the prayer line
[54:16] and then standing over here his eyes are
[54:19] completely made whoa whole and it was
[54:21] between as brother ram said between the
[54:24] here and there the angel of the lord was
[54:27] present others could not understand what
[54:29] happened between here and there and
[54:31] brother braham kept working with that
[54:33] phrase in life as the healer as he's
[54:35] there in the discernment and i think
[54:37] it's very fitting for our lives and our
[54:39] walk in a walk of faith that when we
[54:41] recognize that we're we're starting and
[54:44] even as god deals with our life no
[54:46] matter where you're at in your journey
[54:48] there is a between here and there
[54:51] you might have a physical need in your
[54:52] body there's a between here and there
[54:55] you might receive news from a doctor and
[54:57] the doctor says this or whatever more
[55:00] well we we don't say well you know uh
[55:02] you know i i'm not i'm just going to
[55:05] tune that out but what we recognize is
[55:07] is that this is a presentation of the
[55:10] walls of jericho and however they're
[55:12] going to come down they're coming down
[55:15] that's how we approach because the
[55:16] promise of god is certain listen if we
[55:19] never experience sickness or we're never
[55:22] going to experience it there would be no
[55:24] need for him to bear the stripes and to
[55:27] provide healing for you and i but i want
[55:30] you to remember i want to remind us here
[55:32] this morning that satan's
[55:34] desire would be to so to try to minimize
[55:37] even divine healing in the body that
[55:40] abraham remember in the sacrifice when
[55:43] those when he made the sacrifice and god
[55:45] was confirming the covenant there was
[55:47] that of the vultures that came down
[55:49] there in the evening time but abraham
[55:53] stood there and he shooed away the
[55:55] vultures he would not let them come to
[55:58] the sacrifice and that's the way the
[56:01] children of god are in this hour there's
[56:04] nothing that we are going to permit the
[56:06] enemy to take one promise from us
[56:09] i don't care how bleak it looks how dark
[56:11] it looks or what the situation might be
[56:14] like god is still god
[56:18] it's in the darkest times where he
[56:21] unfolds and makes the greatness of his
[56:24] glory to be made known
[56:26] and so when we're looking at this
[56:28] thought i i'd say all that with this
[56:30] part of it that i want to speak here
[56:33] this morning on a thought awakening the
[56:36] sixth sense
[56:37] awakening the sixth sense i i just will
[56:40] skip over some scriptures here at the
[56:42] beginning that you realize that paul
[56:44] would speak to the people of god in that
[56:47] hour to recognize where they are at in
[56:50] time even then and i believe it's so
[56:53] much more fitting for us and he says
[56:55] it's time that we awake it's time that
[56:58] we wake up because our salvation is
[57:02] nearer now than when we first believed
[57:05] so the when we think of this here with
[57:07] this awakening just a little background
[57:10] of where we're going brother branham in
[57:12] the message faith is the sixth sense
[57:15] he's he gives many different testimonies
[57:17] and he's in prayer and i'm reading here
[57:19] from a prayer and he's he's saying our
[57:22] heavenly father the sixth sense these
[57:24] testimonies from the bible that the
[57:26] sixth sense as i call it faith and he
[57:29] begins to rehearse hebrews 11 and he
[57:32] says how that they subdued kingdoms and
[57:34] stopped lions and escaped the edge of
[57:36] the sword enoch was translated into
[57:39] heaven by the sixth sense abraham
[57:41] sojourned in a strange land and received
[57:44] a son after he was a hundred years old
[57:47] and sarah's womb was dead he considered
[57:49] not those things he staggered not at the
[57:52] promise of god through unbelief but was
[57:54] strong giving glory to god he knowed god
[57:58] made the promise and god he was fully
[58:00] persuaded would keep what he promised
[58:04] brother braham says this oh god we're
[58:06] supposed to be the children of abraham
[58:09] what a poor excuse we are oh god wake up
[58:13] the sixth sense in this church amongst
[58:16] the people tonight and because we can
[58:18] see that great sign to abraham there
[58:21] that taken place god i pray that they'll
[58:25] see the angel of the lord's presence
[58:28] tonight and will not rely upon their
[58:31] feeling or upon their sight but upon the
[58:33] word of god that made the promise now
[58:36] let me just pause here for a moment he's
[58:38] identifying the time that we are living
[58:41] in right now
[58:42] that god made a promise that he would he
[58:45] would visit he would visit here the the
[58:49] gentile church at the end of the
[58:51] dispensation and what he did back there
[58:54] in genesis 18 he did it here when he
[58:57] came and was revealed as the son of man
[59:00] and now that same son of man he came
[59:03] through a prophetic ministry and
[59:05] revealed or making himself known that's
[59:08] what the message is the unfolding of
[59:10] jesus christ now that same angel of the
[59:13] lord is present in a body of believers
[59:18] that's why brother could say i charge
[59:20] you to believe that the son of man is
[59:23] manifest in the body of the bride
[59:26] because it was there in a son of man now
[59:30] it is revealed in the body of believers
[59:34] so there is whole think of it now the
[59:36] whole coming of of the word
[59:39] of the angel of the lord of the holy
[59:41] spirit coming in that in that manner is
[59:44] to raise our faith
[59:46] in the word of god now notice when they
[59:48] would see the angel of the lord's
[59:50] presence tonight they would not rely
[59:53] upon their feeling upon their sight but
[59:56] upon the word of god that made the
[59:59] promise
[1:00:00] and every person in here would be healed
[1:00:03] and everyone that's unsaved will be
[1:00:05] saved and all without the holy ghost
[1:00:08] will receive it you see anything that we
[1:00:11] receive from god it comes
[1:00:14] because faith is present and pray faith
[1:00:18] has been awakened and activated in him
[1:00:23] who is made the promise is here to
[1:00:25] fulfill it
[1:00:27] now notice in in the in his making
[1:00:29] himself known in his appearing
[1:00:32] the the purpose that god would come as
[1:00:35] he would even come through this service
[1:00:38] and as he's come in previous services is
[1:00:41] that when we when when everything is
[1:00:43] said and done here if
[1:00:45] after this service we are not walking
[1:00:48] back out of here and like as though that
[1:00:50] we have a bag that we uh well i set my
[1:00:53] bag of my feelings out there and when i
[1:00:55] get out of service oh brothers where did
[1:00:57] you put my bag of feelings at where did
[1:01:00] you put my bag of sight my bag of
[1:01:01] hearing you know because i just i was i
[1:01:04] just laid down my bag i'm ready to take
[1:01:06] my baggage back up but the reason that
[1:01:09] we have come and the reason he comes and
[1:01:12] speaks to our hearts is that there's no
[1:01:15] more baggage that we're going to carry
[1:01:17] out of here
[1:01:19] it's to realize that god is present when
[1:01:22] god anoints a man and that man begins to
[1:01:24] speak under the inspiration and the
[1:01:27] discernment of the holy spirit we don't
[1:01:29] want to reason with it we just want to
[1:01:32] accept it and let the baggage be gone
[1:01:35] and say lord my faith is standing there
[1:01:38] upon the word of god that man don't know
[1:01:41] me or maybe the man does but it's god
[1:01:43] who speaks to your heart if we're in an
[1:01:46] atmosphere where the holy spirit is
[1:01:48] present to move upon our lives
[1:01:52] i think it's quite a paradox how that
[1:01:55] god will take within a service and guide
[1:01:57] and direct and and lead and speak to
[1:02:00] hearts and lives and discerning hearts
[1:02:02] and ministering to such uh a vast
[1:02:07] amount of needs within that service as a
[1:02:10] matter of fact he'll he's here to
[1:02:11] minister to every single heart and every
[1:02:14] single need what it depends on is
[1:02:17] whether or not that will receive it but
[1:02:20] i would say here this morning and today
[1:02:22] i would say god
[1:02:23] let me be so awakened to your presence
[1:02:26] let me be so awakened to that lord let
[1:02:29] let faith be so awakened and activated
[1:02:32] you know there's a there's a scripture
[1:02:34] in in the book of luke and uh you know
[1:02:37] just just trying to watch my my time
[1:02:40] here
[1:02:40] there was um a parable that's given and
[1:02:44] in luke 18 1
[1:02:46] the the lord jesus said men ought always
[1:02:50] to pray
[1:02:51] and not to faint
[1:02:54] that's a powerful statement
[1:02:56] to faint means to grow weak
[1:02:59] to grow
[1:03:00] weary all right let's just put it in
[1:03:03] layman's terms
[1:03:04] i don't see anything
[1:03:07] i don't see any effect from my prayers
[1:03:12] i don't see anything happening
[1:03:19] now we had a choice
[1:03:21] either we're going to go about what we
[1:03:24] don't feel well i don't feel any
[1:03:25] different
[1:03:27] or i don't see things any different now
[1:03:29] let me just say this to you
[1:03:31] jesus said either by our words will be
[1:03:34] condemned or will be justified
[1:03:39] is that right
[1:03:40] it's powerful your testimony and your
[1:03:42] confession is very important he's the
[1:03:45] high priest of our confession
[1:03:49] brother brahman said the moment you
[1:03:51] start looking around he said and then he
[1:03:54] said you even make a statement well i
[1:03:56] don't have very good faith i don't have
[1:03:58] my faith's not that strong he said the
[1:04:00] moment that you start doing that that's
[1:04:03] when it starts trickling out and he said
[1:04:05] at that moment that's when you're
[1:04:06] talking the devil's language
[1:04:10] brother graham goes on many quotes we
[1:04:12] could pull out of this one he says i
[1:04:13] don't care how strong a person is how
[1:04:16] strong and solid they are in their
[1:04:18] christian faith if something was to get
[1:04:21] a hold of you
[1:04:24] and say i'm not a christian no more
[1:04:28] he said you watch from that moment and
[1:04:31] you utter it out watch from that moment
[1:04:33] that life will start going down
[1:04:35] now we understand there's degrees
[1:04:37] there's there's where the holy spirit
[1:04:39] begins to deal with the life and
[1:04:40] justification and sanctification and my
[1:04:43] the working of the holy spirit can be
[1:04:46] it's so great within those measures and
[1:04:48] we understand that with the seal of the
[1:04:50] living god once a life has been sealed
[1:04:53] there is no going back because there's
[1:04:56] nothing to go back to
[1:04:58] are you hearing me now
[1:05:00] but it comes down if we can just apply
[1:05:02] it in this broad parent's principle you
[1:05:05] or i as the bible could say many things
[1:05:07] regarding our speech and our tongue it
[1:05:10] said power and life and death is in the
[1:05:13] power of the tongue
[1:05:16] the greatest thing we can do is when we
[1:05:18] are feeling discouraged is to take it to
[1:05:20] god in prayer but don't pick it up when
[1:05:23] you take it there
[1:05:25] are you hearing me friends
[1:05:27] don't pick it up when you take it there
[1:05:29] and this is this is the reality that the
[1:05:32] lord jesus is ministering here uh
[1:05:35] regarding this situation of how there
[1:05:37] was a judge let me just preach from the
[1:05:39] scripture here he was a judge and he's
[1:05:42] an unjust judge but there was a woman
[1:05:45] that had a need
[1:05:46] she stayed on his doorstep she kept
[1:05:50] knocking on his door in other words she
[1:05:54] was on his hands and she wasn't gonna
[1:05:57] get off his hands unless her need was
[1:06:00] met what do you call that that's called
[1:06:02] faith
[1:06:04] she was turned down
[1:06:06] turned down but she stood right there
[1:06:09] why did she stay right there because she
[1:06:12] knew he's the one that can minister to
[1:06:15] my need
[1:06:18] the trouble i've got he's the one that
[1:06:20] can take care of it that's what faith is
[1:06:26] well i'm just going to preach sometimes
[1:06:28] in this with push button age where we're
[1:06:30] in and everything is well come on you
[1:06:32] know everything's got to be instant and
[1:06:34] if it's not instant that's not faith
[1:06:39] no
[1:06:40] faith itself is a settled reality in the
[1:06:43] living god
[1:06:45] even when you're approaching god for a
[1:06:47] promise
[1:06:48] that's what brother brahma said if
[1:06:49] you're coming up here to receive the
[1:06:51] holy ghost and you say well i don't know
[1:06:53] i might receive it he said just stay in
[1:06:55] your seat because you ain't gonna get
[1:06:57] nothing
[1:06:59] you've got to approach god with the real
[1:07:01] faith
[1:07:05] every promise of god
[1:07:07] these are things that when we look
[1:07:09] around here with this widow woman and i
[1:07:12] i want to get to that place how god
[1:07:14] moves and and energizes our faith and
[1:07:17] this is why when the lord jesus could
[1:07:19] say of this setting in
[1:07:22] luke 18 7 and shall not god avenge his
[1:07:26] own elect which cried day and night unto
[1:07:28] him though he bear long with them
[1:07:32] what's he letting you and i know
[1:07:34] that there's no prayer
[1:07:37] when it's according to the will of god
[1:07:39] ever goes unanswered
[1:07:43] are you hearing me now
[1:07:45] every prayer this is why when brother
[1:07:47] branham could be baptizing people right
[1:07:49] there and he said oh god let their mama
[1:07:51] look over the banister of time
[1:07:53] let their mama see all the prayers that
[1:07:56] was prayed let her see it being answered
[1:07:59] we're living in an hour where the lamb
[1:08:01] has come and taken the book
[1:08:04] we're living in a time as revelations 8
[1:08:07] 1 would speak at the opening of the
[1:08:09] seventh seal there was given a golden
[1:08:11] censor that was full of the prayers of
[1:08:14] the saints you know what they've been
[1:08:15] praying about they've been praying about
[1:08:17] the finishing up of redemption and what
[1:08:20] was god doing god was stockpiling those
[1:08:23] prayers and saying i've heard those
[1:08:25] prayers but i can't answer them yet
[1:08:27] until that last name that is on the book
[1:08:31] has been sealed away
[1:08:35] so just because that we're not seeing
[1:08:37] anything at that moment that had nothing
[1:08:39] to do with faith
[1:08:41] but it's the objective that we would
[1:08:43] grow weary we would grow faint
[1:08:48] this is why we've got to have a greater
[1:08:50] source than our site
[1:08:52] we've got to have a greater source than
[1:08:54] any of our senses
[1:08:56] we've got to have a greater source than
[1:08:57] a twitter page or facebook or whatever
[1:09:00] you got to have a greater source
[1:09:02] amen an unseen source on the presence of
[1:09:05] the living god that will give you
[1:09:07] strength that when it doesn't your
[1:09:09] feelings will say things to you you've
[1:09:11] got to have a faith that goes beyond
[1:09:13] your feelings
[1:09:15] and i'm saying that it's not god is not
[1:09:17] saying it to condemn us it's god
[1:09:20] speaking that we would be awakened to
[1:09:23] where we are limiting god it isn't that
[1:09:26] well lord i'm just waiting on you
[1:09:27] sometimes sometimes it's god is waiting
[1:09:31] on us
[1:09:33] he wakened me as a man that was waking
[1:09:36] out of sleep what does what does thou
[1:09:37] see
[1:09:38] and he begins to describe that of the
[1:09:41] menorah which is a type all of those
[1:09:44] channels being fed by that oil and the
[1:09:48] fire on top it was a type of the life of
[1:09:51] the believer that our lives were meant
[1:09:53] to be channels
[1:09:55] it's not us doing the work but it's god
[1:09:58] doing it through us but we must be
[1:10:02] yielded to him
[1:10:04] nevertheless he said when the son of man
[1:10:07] cometh this is a very uh uh a tremendous
[1:10:10] question shall he
[1:10:12] find
[1:10:13] faith
[1:10:14] on the earth
[1:10:16] that's in this hour he didn't ask the
[1:10:18] question as you hear brother braham say
[1:10:20] it over and over will he find churches
[1:10:22] will he find schools
[1:10:24] will he find no he asked will he find
[1:10:26] faith
[1:10:27] god has promised
[1:10:29] that in this hour
[1:10:31] sending the ministry of malachi 4 was to
[1:10:36] restore the original bible faith
[1:10:42] how how can the original bible faith be
[1:10:44] restored by the original bible holy
[1:10:48] ghost
[1:10:49] not a portion but christ in his fullness
[1:10:56] so god god don't forget any prayer
[1:10:59] so you can just you can just you know
[1:11:01] put that right in the devil's face
[1:11:03] everything that's praying now sometimes
[1:11:04] we pray for things and we're not getting
[1:11:06] it and we get frustrated because we want
[1:11:08] to see it happen this way
[1:11:11] i mean if it was up to us we'd have been
[1:11:13] telling we would have been telling the
[1:11:15] the captain of the lord's hosts that
[1:11:17] ain't the way we're going to do it we
[1:11:18] ain't going around there seven times i
[1:11:19] don't even make sense uh it don't make
[1:11:21] sense to go around that way you know
[1:11:22] they're not logical when has there ever
[1:11:24] been anybody that's done that and you
[1:11:25] know we look at things sometimes and the
[1:11:27] reason we get so trapped in our senses
[1:11:31] instead of waiting on god the greatest
[1:11:34] thing we can do is what joshua did when
[1:11:36] god revealed himself joshua bowed his
[1:11:40] head upon the earth and worshiped and
[1:11:42] this is what he said powerful words what
[1:11:44] would you have thy servant do he
[1:11:48] recognized his position in the presence
[1:11:51] of the mighty angel
[1:11:53] oh may god help us this morning that we
[1:11:56] can recognize our position when god
[1:11:59] comes to minister to our need that it's
[1:12:01] not how i'm i'm looking at it in my mind
[1:12:03] you know brother branham as it comes to
[1:12:05] me now brother brahm talks about he says
[1:12:07] many times he said we'll go around and
[1:12:08] we pray and then we say that god didn't
[1:12:10] answer our prayer and he said the
[1:12:12] reality of it is he said his god didn't
[1:12:14] answer it the way that we had it figured
[1:12:16] out
[1:12:18] or that it had to come
[1:12:20] come home we're talking about talking to
[1:12:22] that of believers it doesn't always
[1:12:24] happen the way that it that that we look
[1:12:26] for things to happen but nonetheless
[1:12:29] faith is just
[1:12:30] setting its sights on the lord now god
[1:12:33] has given us census here five senses in
[1:12:36] our earthly body and those five senses
[1:12:38] are given to contact our earthly home
[1:12:41] and we thank god for them we all we want
[1:12:44] them to be dedicated to the lord see
[1:12:46] taste feel smell and hear and god has
[1:12:48] given us five spiritual senses that
[1:12:51] control the spirit our imagination
[1:12:53] conscience memory reason and affections
[1:12:55] and and we thank god for all that too
[1:12:58] because we realize friends that these
[1:13:00] things are not given to be an enemy but
[1:13:02] if you remember
[1:13:03] when nehemiah was brought back after
[1:13:05] they had after the temple had been built
[1:13:08] now the coming of the building of the
[1:13:09] walls when they returned from babylon he
[1:13:12] never changed the positions of the gate
[1:13:14] the fish gate remained in its position
[1:13:17] the sheep gate remained in its position
[1:13:19] but he repaired those gates and he put
[1:13:22] locks and bars he put what needed to be
[1:13:25] put upon them and that's the way the
[1:13:27] holy spirit does when it sets down in
[1:13:30] the midst of our life he doesn't do away
[1:13:32] with those other channels but now they
[1:13:34] are brought subject to a son and
[1:13:37] daughter of god on the inside
[1:13:40] is that right that's why brother baby
[1:13:42] could tell us he said if our reason re
[1:13:44] if our reasoning reasons with the word
[1:13:47] he said then it's of god but if it
[1:13:49] reasons against it that very moment we
[1:13:52] turn it out and we tell we stay on the
[1:13:54] word
[1:13:56] now faith itself it was given it was
[1:13:58] given to us to the human race that we
[1:14:01] could contact our heavenly father it's
[1:14:03] greater than all these other senses as a
[1:14:05] matter of fact brother branham would say
[1:14:07] it in this way
[1:14:08] that faith
[1:14:10] delivers us
[1:14:12] and rescues us from our five senses that
[1:14:15] we were put here in the beginning
[1:14:18] it delivers us and rescues us from these
[1:14:21] five senses
[1:14:22] because you know many times he says
[1:14:26] we we we we are this this census he said
[1:14:29] those six senses they become dormant
[1:14:31] and and they don't act at all he's
[1:14:33] talking about how things can become so
[1:14:35] dormant and he's identifying at that
[1:14:37] time of where the church was at he said
[1:14:40] that the church they've done the same
[1:14:42] thing to the sixth sense of god in other
[1:14:44] words binding it off and putting it way
[1:14:47] out there instead of bringing the
[1:14:49] reality that god has given that sense of
[1:14:53] faith to the church of the living god
[1:14:56] and that there's there's only one way
[1:14:58] that you and i can ever obtain any
[1:15:01] promise of god and that's by faith
[1:15:05] is that right so in in every and
[1:15:07] everything that we look at it's like you
[1:15:10] know when you take the senses of of a
[1:15:12] person and
[1:15:13] brother brown is going into it of where
[1:15:15] they say to that individual well you
[1:15:18] know
[1:15:19] i've done every doctor says i've done
[1:15:21] everything i can do
[1:15:23] uh there's nothing else that i can do
[1:15:25] i've done this treatment and you went
[1:15:26] and seen this doctor and now after
[1:15:28] seeing this doctrine they go to the doc
[1:15:30] every one of them are saying there's
[1:15:32] nothing else that can be done
[1:15:34] and but yet that's the time brother
[1:15:36] brown said that's the time to call on
[1:15:38] the sixth sense
[1:15:40] that's the time to accept god that's to
[1:15:43] rely upon the spirit of faith that god
[1:15:46] has put in you
[1:15:49] oh he says there's so many times that we
[1:15:52] we depend too much on our five senses
[1:15:56] and we can say amen throughout this
[1:15:58] building surely there's too many times
[1:16:00] that we depend upon our five senses and
[1:16:04] god with his word bringing his word is
[1:16:07] trying to bring that deliverance to our
[1:16:10] lives that we're even though things can
[1:16:12] be around us look there's things going
[1:16:14] to stand in front of us as far as sight
[1:16:16] that you can't look at them and say they
[1:16:18] ain't there
[1:16:20] josh when caleb didn't walk over in the
[1:16:22] land and say you guys are a bunch of
[1:16:24] liars there ain't giants over there
[1:16:26] joshua and caleb said there's giants all
[1:16:27] right but we got a great big god i made
[1:16:29] a great big promise
[1:16:32] are you hearing me now yeah i hear this
[1:16:34] report but i got a greater report than
[1:16:37] that doctor's report
[1:16:39] when they stood before the red sea
[1:16:41] remember them people were all looking
[1:16:44] back and they seen pharaoh's army coming
[1:16:46] after what were they looking through
[1:16:48] their natural eyes what they could hear
[1:16:50] the trembling they felt the trembling of
[1:16:52] the ground all their reasoning is is boy
[1:16:55] we're gonna get it now but notice what
[1:16:57] god given leadership in that moment how
[1:17:00] god comes down and he speaks there to
[1:17:03] moses and moses anointed by the spirit
[1:17:06] of god he speaks out and prophesies that
[1:17:10] those egyptians that you see today
[1:17:13] you will see no more stand still and see
[1:17:18] the salvation of the lord what's he
[1:17:20] doing we need to direct our natural side
[1:17:23] and get away from that and be focused on
[1:17:27] the god who made the promise he did not
[1:17:29] bring us this far to leave us but that
[1:17:32] same god that's brought us this far
[1:17:35] he'll lead us all the way that's his
[1:17:38] promised word
[1:17:42] and anything contrary to that
[1:17:44] it's a lie
[1:17:47] that's when we call anything contrary to
[1:17:50] the promise that's a lie
[1:17:53] give me a little bit more here because
[1:17:55] i'm losing it thank you everything
[1:17:57] contrary it's a lie
[1:18:00] we're not we're not denying and we're
[1:18:01] not look past it
[1:18:03] because you don't get anywhere by
[1:18:04] ignoring it
[1:18:06] we are men we are ordained to overcome
[1:18:10] if the bible did not say blessed are he
[1:18:12] that ignoreth
[1:18:14] now there's times we do need to ignore
[1:18:16] times you do need to ignore what the
[1:18:18] enemy is saying and override all that
[1:18:21] but we're not ignoring we're looking at
[1:18:23] a promise we're looking at maybe a
[1:18:25] situation whatever it is god has made a
[1:18:28] promise and that promise is to me god
[1:18:32] has confirmed his work do you realize
[1:18:34] what the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:18:36] it's a confirmation in your heart and
[1:18:38] life that god has seen and recognized
[1:18:41] your faith and you've got a right to
[1:18:43] stand there with every promise of god no
[1:18:47] matter what comes your way you have
[1:18:50] already the answer it lays inside of you
[1:18:54] where you can look at the word and you
[1:18:55] can say well i don't feel nothing i
[1:18:57] don't see any faith but there's already
[1:18:59] been the greatest confirmation and
[1:19:02] that's god revealing himself to you
[1:19:05] personally
[1:19:08] hallelujah if god's on our side
[1:19:11] tell me who
[1:19:16] who might show up in a lot of watts
[1:19:20] right
[1:19:21] devil can show up as cancer devil can
[1:19:23] show up as this a devil but but notice
[1:19:25] we're recognizing not what we see here
[1:19:29] but it's on but there is a spiritual
[1:19:31] power that's behind it and god is
[1:19:34] greater than every
[1:19:36] demon-inspired thing that would want to
[1:19:38] try to come my way
[1:19:42] oh my my
[1:19:44] oh my think of it now
[1:19:47] you know this this spiritual this this
[1:19:49] sixth sense
[1:19:51] but the man would say oh if we could
[1:19:52] just if we could just tap in we would
[1:19:55] bypass so many things
[1:19:57] and we would bypass so many things
[1:20:00] within our lives
[1:20:06] let me just stop it doesn't mean you're
[1:20:07] gonna we're gonna bypass trials
[1:20:11] it don't win because you can't trials
[1:20:13] listen trials and tests are ordained of
[1:20:17] god it is the perfecting
[1:20:20] the perfecting of our lives
[1:20:24] it is it is the tool in the in that god
[1:20:27] is permitted to protect to mold and
[1:20:30] shape our lives but you see when we're
[1:20:33] not walking by faith are you with me now
[1:20:35] when we're really not walking and in
[1:20:37] tuning in step with god there can be a
[1:20:39] lot of other things we can get entangled
[1:20:42] in and say oh i'm in a great big trout
[1:20:44] and it ain't even a trial it's just a
[1:20:46] poor decision we made
[1:20:48] somebody preach with me now
[1:20:50] the devil got blamed for a lot of stuff
[1:20:52] and he's sitting on the corner i didn't
[1:20:53] even do that
[1:20:54] i didn't even do that and here i am
[1:20:56] getting credit for all this
[1:20:59] faith is a master of every circumstance
[1:21:05] you can put anything you want on that
[1:21:06] list of circumstance and listen we're
[1:21:09] not minimizing circumstances what we're
[1:21:12] trying to say is that faith masters
[1:21:15] every circumstance faith does not do
[1:21:18] away with the circumstance but it gives
[1:21:20] you strength to go through it
[1:21:26] this is why paul and over and over in
[1:21:29] the scriptures we walk by faith and we
[1:21:31] don't walk by sight
[1:21:33] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:21:36] for it's it's real
[1:21:38] it's the evidence of things that's not
[1:21:41] seen
[1:21:42] because it was by it in verse 2 that the
[1:21:44] elders obtained a good report
[1:21:47] by faith they did this through faith we
[1:21:49] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:21:52] by the word of god so that things which
[1:21:54] were seen were not made of things which
[1:21:56] do appear
[1:21:57] in verse 6 of hebrews 11 i know these
[1:22:00] are familiar scriptures to us but
[1:22:01] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:22:05] him
[1:22:11] for he that cometh to god
[1:22:14] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:22:16] rewarder of them
[1:22:19] that diligently seek him
[1:22:22] so must believe that he is
[1:22:25] and that he is a rewarder
[1:22:29] of them that do what
[1:22:32] diligently seek him
[1:22:35] not half-heartedly
[1:22:38] not well i don't know maybe it might be
[1:22:40] or i've tried or i've known so so it got
[1:22:43] to be diligently seeking after him
[1:22:50] everything else is is laid aside let me
[1:22:52] just
[1:22:53] i just have to go as he brings does he
[1:22:55] bring in different things to me to leave
[1:22:57] the notes here for a moment brother
[1:22:58] graham talked about a man um brother
[1:23:01] sharon i believe it was and brother
[1:23:03] share it he knew brother branham real
[1:23:05] well i mean when you can go and call and
[1:23:07] have dinner with him you know him pretty
[1:23:09] well and oral roberts he knew oral
[1:23:10] roberts that way
[1:23:12] and and and and brother sherrod had had
[1:23:15] a had a need in his body
[1:23:18] and the the doctors
[1:23:21] you know it was with the kidneys and the
[1:23:22] doctors had said
[1:23:24] well you know we're going to have to do
[1:23:26] something about this
[1:23:27] and brother sharon he went and he said
[1:23:29] well i'm just going to i'll call oral
[1:23:31] and brother oral we'll have dinner
[1:23:32] together and ask him to pray for me and
[1:23:34] that'll be it
[1:23:36] so he called brother oral up they had
[1:23:38] dinner
[1:23:39] brother prayed for him
[1:23:41] it relieved a little bit
[1:23:43] and then hear it it coming back
[1:23:46] now i know what you might be thinking
[1:23:48] you might be thinking well his faith
[1:23:49] should have kept it away well let's
[1:23:50] listen to the rest of the story
[1:23:54] so here he says
[1:23:56] i need to have an appointment with
[1:23:57] brother branham we i need to have have a
[1:23:59] time with
[1:24:00] him and so brother brother sherrod sat
[1:24:03] down with brother branham brother bramy
[1:24:05] said i don't see anything to hindering
[1:24:07] it he prayed for him he got better and
[1:24:09] then here it came back again
[1:24:11] finally they had they're going to have
[1:24:12] to do the surgery
[1:24:14] on his kidney
[1:24:15] and brother sharon he come to that place
[1:24:17] he said i just you know i just have to
[1:24:18] have it done
[1:24:20] he got to laying on his back and as he
[1:24:22] was laying there
[1:24:24] he began to think about the lord and his
[1:24:26] goodness
[1:24:27] and he said lord
[1:24:29] you know
[1:24:30] i love you
[1:24:32] brother brandon said the testimony they
[1:24:34] did the surgery but the testimony he
[1:24:36] said such an atmosphere filled that room
[1:24:40] he said to even the surgeons had to
[1:24:43] testify about it
[1:24:45] he said what was it he said because his
[1:24:48] confidence is if he got with brother
[1:24:50] oral or his confidence if he had got
[1:24:52] with me he said it had to come back to
[1:24:54] that first principle i love the lord
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:01] remember faith worketh by love
[1:25:04] is that right
[1:25:06] oh my
[1:25:07] i love how god takes things sometimes
[1:25:09] and like we've got it all figured out
[1:25:10] and god said let me just scramble it up
[1:25:12] a little bit because you don't have it
[1:25:14] all figured out
[1:25:15] god loves to make himself known to you
[1:25:18] and i
[1:25:20] the bible would tell us faith coming by
[1:25:22] hearing and hearing by the word of god
[1:25:25] you see anything that our sense our
[1:25:27] senses can declare
[1:25:29] it's no more faith
[1:25:33] it's no more faith
[1:25:36] but we first must believe this is god's
[1:25:39] word
[1:25:40] and you must come to god by his word
[1:25:43] just like abraham abraham the voice of
[1:25:46] god spoke to abraham and abraham began
[1:25:49] his journey
[1:25:51] out of babylon into the land of promise
[1:25:55] you know what he had to do he had to
[1:25:56] follow the voice
[1:26:00] he didn't have he did not see that land
[1:26:04] he wasn't partaking of that land as far
[1:26:06] as eating anything of it
[1:26:09] but the voice had spoke to him
[1:26:13] and there was something
[1:26:14] it caught a hold inside of him by
[1:26:18] predestination it found a betting ground
[1:26:21] to where here abraham began to walk and
[1:26:24] follow that voice it was a faith that it
[1:26:26] began to paul say it did not that faith
[1:26:29] itself is not or the faith that we saw
[1:26:33] in genesis 22 when he takes isaac up to
[1:26:36] offer the ram it doesn't look the same
[1:26:39] as when it starts out but if it only as
[1:26:42] it will obey the voice that faith that
[1:26:45] was in there will mature to that place
[1:26:53] just say this here because i can't get
[1:26:55] in and lay all this in this morning
[1:26:58] but every person
[1:27:00] has
[1:27:02] faith within them
[1:27:07] because you couldn't even believe god he
[1:27:09] that cometh to god must first believe
[1:27:10] that he is god it's got to be already a
[1:27:12] part that god has put in to even when
[1:27:14] the word is preached
[1:27:18] something begins to stir up
[1:27:20] but you see the whole purpose is is god
[1:27:23] stirring up that faith to where then
[1:27:26] where the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:28] comes in that's god's faith and then
[1:27:31] god's faith sets down in the middle of
[1:27:34] our faith and influences our faith
[1:27:40] and i wish i could just preach on that
[1:27:41] right now
[1:27:44] that's what we are getting to but you
[1:27:46] know to understand that there are things
[1:27:49] of how
[1:27:50] when we look at things it's just you
[1:27:52] know this faith is just as real as any
[1:27:55] sense within our body
[1:27:57] actions will our actions will declare it
[1:28:01] and it comes to us this substance it
[1:28:03] comes to us by hearing the word of god
[1:28:06] and that only so that puts it back to
[1:28:09] where faith faith is not as brother
[1:28:11] brown would say in some individual it's
[1:28:14] not in a man it's not an organization
[1:28:17] it's not in a group of people it's in
[1:28:19] god because god is the word and your
[1:28:22] faith is in god
[1:28:24] then what god's word is said is true and
[1:28:27] let every other man's word be a lie
[1:28:33] oh my now i want you to look at this
[1:28:35] here
[1:28:37] and we know the parable
[1:28:39] of the four different types of ground
[1:28:41] where speaking of the sowing of the word
[1:28:45] and i just want to focus upon that of
[1:28:47] the good ground
[1:28:49] brother branham would call this
[1:28:51] the good ground
[1:28:52] you recognize as even as that would
[1:28:55] continue to as it continued to unfold
[1:28:57] always predestination lay there because
[1:29:00] predestination is a reality of the
[1:29:02] scriptures
[1:29:05] anything less than that it becomes your
[1:29:07] own perseverance
[1:29:10] brother samuel you mean to tell me that
[1:29:11] you don't have to do anything no because
[1:29:13] you are predestinated there is that
[1:29:16] already that seed laying within you
[1:29:20] brother branham called it the
[1:29:21] pre-prepared
[1:29:23] ground
[1:29:25] it was already prepared by god what was
[1:29:28] he prepared for in works as faith
[1:29:31] expressed he said god has prepared you
[1:29:34] to recognize and receive him in this
[1:29:37] generation
[1:29:38] jacob was predestinated but he still had
[1:29:42] to wrestle it out with the angel of the
[1:29:44] lord
[1:29:47] esau didn't want it
[1:29:49] esau didn't see it was necessary
[1:29:52] he saw said my daddy's a prophet i mean
[1:29:55] i've been raised around this message
[1:29:57] i've been this and that you see there
[1:29:58] was if everything there wasn't anything
[1:30:01] that was sparking within esau esau was
[1:30:04] willing to sell the birthright the
[1:30:06] privilege the opportunity for a mess of
[1:30:09] college
[1:30:10] you realize that's what the lady will
[1:30:11] see in church did they sold the
[1:30:14] birthright that was among them and they
[1:30:16] put christ on the outside of the church
[1:30:19] they esteemed their programs they
[1:30:22] esteemed all that greater than jesus
[1:30:24] christ come on now let's not leave it
[1:30:26] out there let's bring it right down here
[1:30:28] we can put him right out if we begin to
[1:30:31] esteem or i'll do this or i know this
[1:30:33] about the message or i'm a pretty good
[1:30:35] guy or we become so involved and wrapped
[1:30:38] up in the carnal things of life it's the
[1:30:41] same way with church programs but
[1:30:44] brother and sister if we ever make the
[1:30:46] grave and we make the rapture it's
[1:30:49] because of a life that is faith in god's
[1:30:52] word where he is first
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:30:58] and when he's first remember it's
[1:31:00] evidence
[1:31:03] you can say it but your actions declare
[1:31:05] your evidence
[1:31:07] are you hearing me now
[1:31:09] so if actions are contrary then what
[1:31:12] you're saying then the thing to do is
[1:31:14] say god i need to get synchronized and
[1:31:17] get lined up because what i'm saying
[1:31:19] here my life is telling a different
[1:31:22] story
[1:31:26] oh lord jesus
[1:31:28] they're talking about some good ground
[1:31:29] now
[1:31:30] now let me just lay this down here just
[1:31:32] for a few moments
[1:31:34] in mark chapter four i'm just gonna read
[1:31:36] two places where the lord jesus talks
[1:31:38] about good ground
[1:31:40] good ground
[1:31:41] he said in mark 4 20 is such as hear the
[1:31:45] word
[1:31:47] and receive it
[1:31:49] and bring forth fruit
[1:31:52] so they hear the word
[1:31:55] now remember
[1:31:57] a person can hear it
[1:31:59] and still remain the same
[1:32:02] is that right
[1:32:04] they can hear it and they was they're
[1:32:06] just as much a drunkard as they ever
[1:32:07] were
[1:32:09] maybe there's some things that get
[1:32:11] cleaned up in their life but they don't
[1:32:12] they don't understand they don't
[1:32:14] recognize our real understanding is a
[1:32:16] transformation
[1:32:18] are you with me
[1:32:20] oh there in satan's eating brother man
[1:32:22] said you know he said but a person who
[1:32:24] hears he that heareth my word and
[1:32:27] believeth on me he said to believe is to
[1:32:29] understand and when a person understands
[1:32:32] he said they're no longer the same
[1:32:35] i'm not talking about understanding that
[1:32:37] we know the doctrines of the message or
[1:32:39] i can finish this quote i can finish
[1:32:41] this chapter and i know all that that's
[1:32:43] not understanding but understanding is
[1:32:46] to recognize him and our need of him
[1:32:54] oh brother and sister you can come to
[1:32:56] this church or any church you can come
[1:32:58] to it for 50 years and 60 years 70 years
[1:33:01] however long it is but until you say god
[1:33:04] open up that channel of hearing and
[1:33:07] really receive the word to receive it is
[1:33:10] submit and surrender your lives to it
[1:33:12] and to recognize i'm no good without
[1:33:15] jesus christ i can't do it without him i
[1:33:18] need his life inside of me we're not
[1:33:22] come to church for a hypo shock to feel
[1:33:25] good and man i feel a little good we're
[1:33:27] here to be changed
[1:33:31] if there's something out of life we're
[1:33:33] here that'll be lined up and has brother
[1:33:35] branham could stand there in the message
[1:33:37] supersense and ask the congregation how
[1:33:40] many would want more of that super sense
[1:33:42] he said god i want more of it lord i
[1:33:45] want it to have more preeminence in my
[1:33:48] life
[1:33:50] [Applause]
[1:33:55] well well well
[1:33:58] luke 18 luke 8 15 the good ground
[1:34:01] are they which in an honest and good
[1:34:04] heart
[1:34:05] you know what that speaks of
[1:34:07] get everything when the word is coming
[1:34:09] forth
[1:34:10] it's a dissolver of doubts
[1:34:12] if it's an unconfessed sin let's get it
[1:34:14] out
[1:34:16] because
[1:34:17] the holy ghost faith can't work where
[1:34:19] it's unconfessed sin
[1:34:22] if there's something in the way see a
[1:34:24] good and on it what is the good and
[1:34:25] honest heart when the word is coming
[1:34:27] forth the word is being ministered
[1:34:29] friends where our lives will align with
[1:34:31] that word
[1:34:32] oh god help us
[1:34:35] having heard the word
[1:34:36] keep it
[1:34:39] and bring forth fruit with patience
[1:34:42] and i love how all of these descriptives
[1:34:45] it goes on in good
[1:34:46] good ground
[1:34:48] good ground you take it and you keep it
[1:34:51] you live it it's it's substance to you
[1:34:55] and with patience
[1:34:57] you bring forth fruit
[1:35:00] fruit doesn't come out overnight
[1:35:03] but fruit comes
[1:35:05] through many trials
[1:35:06] there are many tests
[1:35:08] it's a patience
[1:35:11] our walk with god is trusting him
[1:35:15] and waiting on him
[1:35:20] faith comes we've got to be able to
[1:35:22] receive the word of god i want you to
[1:35:24] watch this with god's grace
[1:35:28] brother brahman said you know a person
[1:35:29] can preach the word explain the word but
[1:35:31] we have to receive the word
[1:35:37] open up our lives and our channels
[1:35:41] say god i want to receive from you
[1:35:44] i believe i believe even services would
[1:35:46] be
[1:35:47] even you say brother sam you mean it can
[1:35:49] go higher oh yeah there's always we can
[1:35:50] always go higher with god and let's just
[1:35:52] be honest if we we would really come
[1:35:54] with that intention that when we're
[1:35:56] coming to the house of god we're really
[1:35:58] praying over coming
[1:36:00] are you hearing me now we're looking
[1:36:02] we're praying and we're we're staying in
[1:36:04] a tune and a fellowship god i need to
[1:36:06] hear from you lord i need you to speak
[1:36:08] to me lord this is why brother ramsey
[1:36:11] told us we are to pray for revelation
[1:36:13] more than anything
[1:36:16] it's so important to our lives
[1:36:19] that god would reveal himself god take
[1:36:22] the man of god you know the needs that's
[1:36:24] present lord i have needs but there
[1:36:26] might be something that that that you
[1:36:29] are seeing that is beyond what i'm
[1:36:30] seeing lord and father that you will
[1:36:33] come by our way and speak to us
[1:36:41] you see when we receive it brother
[1:36:43] branham here he goes in to explain this
[1:36:44] when we receive he says that word
[1:36:47] we receive it the revelation
[1:36:49] something slips out of the unseen world
[1:36:53] yonder
[1:36:54] and comes rolling down through a
[1:36:56] mystical channel somewhere into your
[1:36:59] soul that says now i see it
[1:37:07] your eyes brighten
[1:37:09] your lips that hung down straighten up
[1:37:11] and smile
[1:37:12] every muscle in your body seems to
[1:37:14] rejoice something's going to happen
[1:37:18] why
[1:37:19] that from the unseen realm moved down it
[1:37:22] came right down into the soul how did it
[1:37:24] through a yielded life
[1:37:26] a yielded vessel
[1:37:30] you can't be yielded if you put god on a
[1:37:32] time schedule
[1:37:34] god you've only got this much window to
[1:37:36] work in
[1:37:37] you might say brother samuel you're only
[1:37:39] saying that because you want more time
[1:37:40] to preach no i'm saying you can't put
[1:37:42] god on a time schedule
[1:37:45] well let's preach why we're here
[1:37:47] oh my we can we can hardly take a
[1:37:49] two-hour service and yet we'll go sit in
[1:37:51] a restaurant for an hour and waiting for
[1:37:53] a special steak to be cooked
[1:37:56] preach brother samuel i'm going to
[1:37:58] well what are we doing we're focused
[1:38:00] more on carnal things
[1:38:02] and if you wait a few hours that steak
[1:38:05] will be gone that bread will be gone
[1:38:07] them onion whatever they are will be
[1:38:09] gone
[1:38:10] and you'll have to eat again it's
[1:38:12] recognizing what are the real real
[1:38:15] things in life are the eternal things
[1:38:18] not the things that we see here
[1:38:23] they fade away
[1:38:25] but to recognize that we're having an uh
[1:38:28] an audience in an in time with god that
[1:38:31] can so affect our lives with problems or
[1:38:34] whatever that we have or what we'll face
[1:38:36] we don't know what we're going to face
[1:38:37] this week
[1:38:40] i think of brother ray and them the true
[1:38:42] word tabernacle they didn't know what
[1:38:43] they were going to face this week
[1:38:48] when that young young couple went on
[1:38:50] home to be with the lord but you know
[1:38:51] they didn't know they were going to face
[1:38:53] that
[1:38:54] but god knew it
[1:38:58] let me tell you how they were prepared
[1:39:00] to face that god knew it god sent his
[1:39:03] word and the word had been building over
[1:39:06] time in hearts and lives it isn't
[1:39:09] something that happens on a moment right
[1:39:11] there i thought as i seen brother chuck
[1:39:13] standing right there and giving you know
[1:39:16] brother chuck the daddy and seen brother
[1:39:18] garrett i looked at that and this is the
[1:39:20] very thing that echoed out of my heart
[1:39:21] that's what this message produces
[1:39:25] that's what it produces it is the faith
[1:39:27] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:39:29] that when i don't understand what's
[1:39:32] going on god is still in control he's a
[1:39:35] great big god he's bigger than my plans
[1:39:38] he's bigger than my purpose he's greater
[1:39:41] than the situation before me
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:49] hallelujah
[1:39:51] oh my
[1:39:52] i tell you look how now watch how god
[1:39:55] will do this
[1:39:57] one way
[1:39:58] see god comes to stimulate our faith
[1:40:03] now god doesn't bring it down and say
[1:40:05] you've got to receive it this way faith
[1:40:07] coming by hearing and hearing by the
[1:40:08] word but i want to remember the word's
[1:40:10] not a letter
[1:40:11] the word's a person
[1:40:14] and he's in his body
[1:40:16] come on now what zechariah saw john saw
[1:40:18] in revelations 1 he saw him walking in
[1:40:21] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:40:23] candlesticks is that right
[1:40:25] so god has many different ways to
[1:40:28] stimulate faith
[1:40:30] but it's him that has to stimulate it
[1:40:33] and it takes us to be able to receive it
[1:40:35] brett vladimire tells us one way is
[1:40:37] through the preaching of the gospel and
[1:40:38] he said you'll have lives and hearts
[1:40:41] that will receive it through the
[1:40:42] preaching of the gospel
[1:40:44] he said then god has gifts in the church
[1:40:49] tongues and prophecy and on and on he
[1:40:51] said and that's another way that god
[1:40:54] will speak
[1:40:55] then he goes in god has prophets and he
[1:40:57] goes into those see what it all comes
[1:40:59] back into
[1:41:00] is that everything no matter how god
[1:41:03] comes and he stimulates your faith it
[1:41:06] isn't that you become dependent on that
[1:41:09] channel are you hearing me now
[1:41:11] somebody hear me now it isn't that you
[1:41:13] become dependent upon that channel it's
[1:41:16] that you recognize god and he is the
[1:41:20] word so then now when a situation rises
[1:41:23] up you're not saying oh sister
[1:41:25] so-and-so's not here or brother
[1:41:26] so-and-so's not here you know sometimes
[1:41:28] god speaks to them or they speak in
[1:41:29] tongues or or brother samuel's not here
[1:41:32] but what it is when we recognize him
[1:41:34] then our faith is positioned in his word
[1:41:38] that's why brother brown could say he
[1:41:39] said it with regarding a vision in
[1:41:41] perfect faith he said every time that he
[1:41:44] spoke to me it has come to pass he said
[1:41:46] but i will say this to you this is
[1:41:48] greater than the vision
[1:41:52] he wasn't doing away with the vision but
[1:41:54] what he's bringing us to the purpose of
[1:41:57] the revealing of the son of man is that
[1:42:00] the faith of the believers would be
[1:42:02] built in the word by the word being
[1:42:05] inside of us
[1:42:07] right is to recognize him and become
[1:42:11] united with him
[1:42:13] that's the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:42:16] is that right
[1:42:17] so it's to stimulate
[1:42:19] our faith now look how brother brahman
[1:42:21] says it like this in that same quote he
[1:42:24] said a person sitting in a group of
[1:42:25] people like this where faith is gathered
[1:42:28] on every side
[1:42:30] it'll help you
[1:42:31] to get well
[1:42:34] that's powerful
[1:42:36] where faith is gathered on every side
[1:42:39] it'll help you to get well
[1:42:43] i know we always get worried about oh
[1:42:45] you're gonna do another x-ray on me well
[1:42:46] i don't i don't know i don't wanna
[1:42:48] radiation i don't wanna think about it
[1:42:50] faith
[1:42:51] faith is greater it's faith in the
[1:42:53] negative faith don't take things from
[1:42:54] you faith brings to his presence brings
[1:42:57] a reality to your life
[1:42:59] think about it as it would begin to
[1:43:01] pulsate faith within a building like
[1:43:03] this you might say brother samuel i'll
[1:43:04] just sit home and stream why not come
[1:43:06] here
[1:43:11] come on now we're not going to be on an
[1:43:12] island by ourselves on the other side
[1:43:14] well i'm just getting blessed right here
[1:43:16] at home but remember we're sitting in a
[1:43:18] group like this where faith is pulsating
[1:43:24] now listen that kickback you're not
[1:43:26] kicking back against me that's against
[1:43:28] the holy ghost
[1:43:30] because god ain't altering and changing
[1:43:32] his word in this hour
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:35] god never oh my god never said forsake
[1:43:37] not to assemble yourselves around the
[1:43:40] computer screen
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:48] hallelujah
[1:43:50] now it's different if there's a real
[1:43:52] need you're sick just like when we were
[1:43:54] sick that's a different story
[1:43:58] but i'm if i'm just doing it because
[1:43:59] it's what well that's just convenient to
[1:44:01] do there's something we need to rethink
[1:44:04] our priorities
[1:44:06] i'm talking about faith
[1:44:10] faith that purses and and presses
[1:44:12] through notice he said it'll help you to
[1:44:14] get well there'll be people who listen
[1:44:17] at the word being taught that'll never
[1:44:19] be in a prayer line yet they'll get well
[1:44:21] for something happens subconsciously
[1:44:24] now i know sometimes that you know we we
[1:44:26] like to cherry-pick quotes
[1:44:30] yes sir that's the way it's going to
[1:44:31] happen for me but you don't determine
[1:44:33] how it's going to happen for you
[1:44:36] you're not the one who determines that
[1:44:40] god has that determined
[1:44:42] but what you and i as believers we stand
[1:44:44] on the word by his stripes i'm healed
[1:44:47] however it's coming it's coming
[1:44:50] i'm a believer and healing is the
[1:44:52] children's bread and i'm one of his
[1:44:54] children
[1:44:56] however it comes it's going to be god do
[1:44:58] it
[1:45:00] thank god for the doctors but it's god
[1:45:03] all healing comes from god
[1:45:09] or something happens subconsciously
[1:45:11] maybe they don't even realize what it's
[1:45:13] all about and they get
[1:45:14] well wow so faith is not even it's not
[1:45:17] even awareness up here
[1:45:20] right because brother brian there have
[1:45:22] been people brother branham called out
[1:45:23] in the line he said oh you didn't think
[1:45:26] you had enough faith to be healed but
[1:45:28] you already healed amen
[1:45:31] faith is greater than our thoughts oh
[1:45:33] boy we ought to have a we'll have a real
[1:45:35] praise time right here right now if you
[1:45:37] can recognize god has delivered it and
[1:45:40] god's desire is to stimulate that it's
[1:45:42] greater than every thought
[1:45:50] he said somebody else can be sitting and
[1:45:51] watch one of the signs of the lord
[1:45:52] appear and they'll get well it's
[1:45:54] anything he said that can stimulate
[1:45:56] faith
[1:45:57] i remember how many remember the
[1:45:58] scripture where paul was preaching
[1:46:01] and paul and there was a man who had
[1:46:03] crippled from his mother's womb he'd
[1:46:05] never walked
[1:46:07] now think about this brother joey it's
[1:46:09] one thing
[1:46:10] you and know we can look at it and say
[1:46:12] you know he had walked at one time but
[1:46:14] that got taken from him well god
[1:46:16] restores that too
[1:46:18] but here
[1:46:19] there wasn't no memory of walking
[1:46:22] this man had grown up all his
[1:46:24] life sitting on on the side of the wall
[1:46:27] watching the rest of him play kickball
[1:46:30] let's just bring it down where it's at
[1:46:32] he recognized there was limitations
[1:46:34] where he could not get out there and do
[1:46:37] like the other children then as it
[1:46:39] continued to progress through life and
[1:46:41] everything else think about it think
[1:46:42] about times not saying that everybody
[1:46:44] that would fall into something like that
[1:46:46] there's complexes but you recognize i
[1:46:48] want you to understand this you
[1:46:49] recognize that a disease there's a
[1:46:51] tormenting spirit that comes with it
[1:46:54] somebody preach with me now i don't care
[1:46:56] if it's anxiety depression or whatever
[1:46:57] it is it's a tormenting devil
[1:47:02] not that you're you understand what i'm
[1:47:04] saying diabetes all those things it's
[1:47:06] afflictions back pain and everything
[1:47:09] else it's it wears it wears a person
[1:47:12] it's a tormenting spirit
[1:47:17] but this man paul uh paul was speaking
[1:47:21] he heard paul speak
[1:47:24] now everybody else heard paul speak too
[1:47:26] but paul was directed by the spirit of
[1:47:29] god he begins to behold this man
[1:47:32] and he perceives he has faith to be
[1:47:36] healed
[1:47:37] there's a witness that has taken place
[1:47:42] how many know what i'm talking about
[1:47:45] i've stood even on this end of
[1:47:46] ministering whether it's been here
[1:47:48] even in other other places where i've
[1:47:50] had ministers that pull me aside and
[1:47:52] it's not me it's
[1:47:53] every real a man of god that's yielded
[1:47:54] to god god will take you down certain
[1:47:56] pathways and you start going down a
[1:47:58] certain strain and what it is is
[1:48:00] recognizing there's a need and the holy
[1:48:02] spirit there's a pool to minister to
[1:48:04] that need paul recognized this just
[1:48:06] wasn't a need but this man had faith to
[1:48:09] be healed
[1:48:10] where did he get that faith from he
[1:48:12] already had faith are you hearing me he
[1:48:15] already had faith but by hearing the
[1:48:18] word and the presence of god it caused
[1:48:21] his faith to rise in god to where he was
[1:48:25] pulsating in his heart this is my night
[1:48:28] this is my moment this is my time and
[1:48:31] the words spoke to him stand up on your
[1:48:34] feet
[1:48:36] this is where brother bannon would take
[1:48:38] us in the scripture with this event and
[1:48:41] other events in the life of the lord
[1:48:43] jesus and say the word is a discerner of
[1:48:46] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:48:48] and if me abide in me and my words abide
[1:48:52] in you ask what you will and it shall be
[1:48:55] done but say what are you saying well
[1:48:57] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:48:59] the word of god if we can open our lives
[1:49:02] and really get locked in and we're
[1:49:04] taking in and say lord i'm here to
[1:49:06] worship you and i'm here to receive from
[1:49:09] you i'm telling you as the words begin
[1:49:12] to abide in our life it drives out doubt
[1:49:15] it drives out unbelief as it's abiding
[1:49:17] in our life what's happening faith is
[1:49:20] rising
[1:49:30] without reading all those scriptures
[1:49:33] yet you're aware
[1:49:35] each time
[1:49:37] the lord jesus with a woman who had an
[1:49:39] issue of blood
[1:49:42] she already had said in herself
[1:49:45] if i can touch the hem of his garment
[1:49:47] i'll be made whole
[1:49:51] she came behind all the multitude
[1:49:54] and she got to jesus
[1:49:56] the response of the word is
[1:49:59] daughter
[1:50:01] be of a good comfort
[1:50:03] thy faith
[1:50:04] not my faith your faith
[1:50:07] hath made thee whole
[1:50:09] the faith was already there it had been
[1:50:12] raised to believe and to accept what he
[1:50:16] had already made available
[1:50:20] remember when blind bartimaeus
[1:50:24] blind bartimaeus had been taught
[1:50:26] you know the the the the the the
[1:50:28] pharisees and different ones brother
[1:50:30] brown dramatized that how they were
[1:50:31] teaching well you know god used to do
[1:50:33] that and god used to do this god opened
[1:50:36] them red sea sure he did but you know
[1:50:38] god don't move like that no more and and
[1:50:40] you know what that is
[1:50:42] that's an old unbeliever standing there
[1:50:44] under the cloak of religion
[1:50:46] that's a person that don't know god
[1:50:50] are you hearing me now because anybody
[1:50:52] who knows god knows he's the same
[1:50:54] yesterday today and forever
[1:50:58] he is still the i am if he ever did it
[1:51:00] one time he was making known i'm the
[1:51:03] same god i'll do it again when the
[1:51:05] conditions are met
[1:51:08] blind bartimaeus heard
[1:51:14] and he began to cry out jesus thou son
[1:51:16] of david have mercy on me
[1:51:19] and people looking around and told him
[1:51:21] shut up
[1:51:23] hold your peace
[1:51:25] but when they told him to do that
[1:51:28] he said i'm going to turn up my praise
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:34] you didn't like that listen to this
[1:51:39] hold your peace
[1:51:40] stop carrying on that way
[1:51:43] but what it was his faith was crying out
[1:51:48] he had a need and he didn't care what
[1:51:51] every other circumstance was saying
[1:51:54] that sixth sense was taking effect it
[1:51:57] had been awakened
[1:51:59] as a man that was awakened out of sleep
[1:52:04] and here in the other part that he did
[1:52:06] jesus stood still and commanded for him
[1:52:09] to come you know what he did
[1:52:11] he had a garment
[1:52:13] on
[1:52:14] now that garment that he hit on that
[1:52:16] garment had a special signification to
[1:52:19] it it was a garment worn by blind men
[1:52:23] are you hearing me the garment that he
[1:52:25] wore just wasn't some garment it held a
[1:52:27] signification that this man of a
[1:52:30] condition it spoke of a condition but he
[1:52:33] cast off the garment
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:37] go ahead and let it go i don't need it
[1:52:39] no more
[1:52:41] i i have summoned i have asked i have
[1:52:44] heard and now the word is calling for me
[1:52:47] to come and stand
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:52] what do you want me to do for you he
[1:52:54] said lord that i've received my sight go
[1:52:56] that way thy faith hath made thee whole
[1:53:05] there was a woman
[1:53:07] bound with seven unclean spirits
[1:53:10] she lived a rough life
[1:53:13] mary magdalene
[1:53:15] if simon would have known that she was
[1:53:18] going to come barging in there they
[1:53:20] would have put everybody at the door
[1:53:22] but the reality jesus kept that
[1:53:25] appointment at simon's house because he
[1:53:27] knew she was coming
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:31] the rest of them wasn't going to receive
[1:53:33] him the rest of them didn't have one
[1:53:34] nothing to do with him but jesus keeps
[1:53:37] every appointment
[1:53:40] he had an appointment in this hour for
[1:53:42] me and you he sent this message brother
[1:53:45] constantine he sent this word for you he
[1:53:48] sent it for our lives to bring
[1:53:50] deliverance in our lives in this hour he
[1:53:53] knew we would be here in this generation
[1:53:57] it didn't matter what we were bound down
[1:53:59] with jesus
[1:54:01] keeps every appointment
[1:54:08] her faith had got stimulated
[1:54:12] she went home
[1:54:14] she got out her money box
[1:54:16] everything that she had been keeping she
[1:54:18] hadn't got it in a real good way
[1:54:20] but she realized this had come
[1:54:22] nonetheless but he deserves all my
[1:54:25] praise
[1:54:26] he deserves everything you know what she
[1:54:28] was typing to a real genuine believer
[1:54:32] when they recognize something begins to
[1:54:34] move in their heart he's all i need and
[1:54:37] you recognize what you have i'm going to
[1:54:40] surrender every day to the lord jesus
[1:54:45] that's how the holy ghost comes when you
[1:54:48] surrender everything
[1:54:56] she makes her way on down through there
[1:54:58] she begins
[1:55:00] to anoint his feet
[1:55:02] wash them with tears
[1:55:06] she didn't have to go to the beauty shop
[1:55:07] and borrow a wig
[1:55:10] preach with me now
[1:55:12] let's just bring down what the prophet
[1:55:14] said he said many of the women nowadays
[1:55:16] would have to stand on their head to dry
[1:55:18] his feet
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:21] come on long hair it's a covering given
[1:55:23] for the woman's glory
[1:55:25] is that right showing the authority and
[1:55:27] the headship that she has heard from god
[1:55:30] and she's under the headship of the word
[1:55:32] of god that ain't my words that's god's
[1:55:34] word
[1:55:36] if you can't believe that word then you
[1:55:37] can't believe any other word
[1:55:40] that's only a little part of the
[1:55:42] scripture that's one little thing that
[1:55:44] god is asking us for
[1:55:48] oh my it didn't matter there was an
[1:55:49] audience all around
[1:55:51] it didn't matter
[1:55:54] it was something moving in her
[1:55:56] i got to get to him
[1:55:58] i got to get to him
[1:56:03] all the whispering everything else that
[1:56:04] went on oh if he knew what kind of a
[1:56:06] woman was touching him if all this was
[1:56:08] going on but you know what in the midst
[1:56:10] of all
[1:56:12] of that that was taking place
[1:56:14] she was having an audience with jesus
[1:56:17] [Applause]
[1:56:19] you know what that is that's a daughter
[1:56:21] of abraham
[1:56:22] while the rest of the kings were out
[1:56:24] there in genesis 14 the king of sodom
[1:56:27] the king of genelom all these other
[1:56:29] kings abraham was having an audience
[1:56:32] with melchizedek
[1:56:36] while the rest of the world is having an
[1:56:38] audience with the kings and spiritual
[1:56:41] powers you and i are privileged to have
[1:56:43] an audience with melchizedek
[1:56:48] the same lord jesus christ
[1:56:51] and if not for his grace sending his
[1:56:54] word his presence we would still be
[1:56:58] bound in our senses but god's grace
[1:57:01] [Music]
[1:57:06] you might have said in a message church
[1:57:08] for a long time but god's grace
[1:57:11] [Applause]
[1:57:13] one day
[1:57:14] you had to have a meeting
[1:57:17] with melchizedek
[1:57:19] i'm talking about the lord jesus christ
[1:57:23] oh my
[1:57:26] what did he tell her
[1:57:28] by faith
[1:57:30] hath saved thee
[1:57:33] go
[1:57:34] in peace
[1:57:38] by faith
[1:57:40] her faith
[1:57:42] had been stimulated
[1:57:44] to that place to accept
[1:57:47] god
[1:57:56] i think that's a very powerful reality
[1:58:02] brother and we'll talk about remember
[1:58:03] you have different ones
[1:58:06] in the message
[1:58:07] brother bran will always i don't say
[1:58:09] always but
[1:58:10] when he deals with messages like faith
[1:58:12] is a sixth sense a super sense and many
[1:58:15] of the mysteries and brother brown will
[1:58:16] bring it up at different times and i
[1:58:18] just say it this way
[1:58:19] the holy spirit bringing it back because
[1:58:21] of needs
[1:58:23] that need to hear those testimonies
[1:58:27] testimonies
[1:58:29] are powerful
[1:58:32] don't you ever don't you ever let the
[1:58:33] devil down by a testimony what god has
[1:58:36] done if god has done something in your
[1:58:38] life you need to testify
[1:58:43] is that right
[1:58:44] you need to give a testimony because
[1:58:46] that right there is a sounding forth god
[1:58:50] is in the camp
[1:58:52] god is present god is present fulfilling
[1:58:54] his word
[1:59:02] those two women
[1:59:04] everybody okay
[1:59:05] it was two women one had an ulcerated
[1:59:07] condition in her stomach the other one
[1:59:09] had a growth on her neck
[1:59:11] they came
[1:59:12] that night
[1:59:14] in that service
[1:59:15] and the spirit of god
[1:59:18] uncovered and spoke to what was there
[1:59:20] and pronounced their healing
[1:59:24] they went home
[1:59:25] that little woman
[1:59:27] she goes home who had the ulcerated
[1:59:28] condition i think it's important that
[1:59:31] how god would inspire this and stop me i
[1:59:33] believe it's important to understand
[1:59:35] this
[1:59:36] she
[1:59:37] her children couldn't finish the oatmeal
[1:59:40] so she's cleaning up the table now
[1:59:41] normally that would have tore up or eat
[1:59:43] or anything
[1:59:45] brother brown goes into it and says she
[1:59:47] took a bite and here's what happened the
[1:59:49] thought in her mind said i'm probably
[1:59:51] going to get sick like i do it other
[1:59:52] times that was a thought
[1:59:54] but faith had already taken hold
[1:59:57] i can tell by some of your looks it's
[1:59:59] getting blown away right now like whoa
[2:00:01] man that's just it shows faith is
[2:00:03] greater than our thoughts
[2:00:06] it masters circumstances
[2:00:09] when you have a contrary thought that's
[2:00:11] not the time to abandon but faith just
[2:00:13] stands right there and says let that
[2:00:15] birdie pass on through but you ain't
[2:00:17] building a nest here
[2:00:20] no
[2:00:21] vacancy
[2:00:23] [Applause]
[2:00:26] amen
[2:00:28] and here they were weeks later brother
[2:00:30] branham tells us
[2:00:31] and when that situation happened with
[2:00:33] her here she took that bite of oatmeal
[2:00:35] man it was good
[2:00:37] i don't know what she had in it i could
[2:00:39] but anyhow it was good
[2:00:42] she did she hate that she eat the rest
[2:00:44] of us there then she made herself some
[2:00:46] eggs
[2:00:47] bacon and everything else
[2:00:49] then she had she was it was done so she
[2:00:51] went down the street to tell her
[2:00:53] neighbor who had that growth on her neck
[2:00:55] and she was in her house shaking the
[2:00:58] sheet because she couldn't find the
[2:00:59] growth
[2:01:05] that brother branham tells us very very
[2:01:07] clearly he said what it was is they had
[2:01:10] received the promise and the sixth sense
[2:01:13] in their life would not take no for an
[2:01:17] answer
[2:01:18] they might have got up the next day and
[2:01:20] they felt bad but they kept pressing on
[2:01:23] and said god has spoken who can but
[2:01:26] prophesy
[2:01:27] [Applause]
[2:01:29] and they got up the next day and they
[2:01:31] got up the next day what was it that
[2:01:33] sixth sense would not take no for an
[2:01:36] answer and about that time the angel of
[2:01:39] the lord came passing through the
[2:01:41] neighborhood because jesus keeps every
[2:01:45] appointment
[2:01:46] [Applause]
[2:01:52] john ryan i know it's familiar right
[2:01:56] john ryan
[2:01:58] comes in
[2:01:59] prayer line
[2:02:00] holy spirit speaks to him
[2:02:02] he goes out he comes right back around
[2:02:06] hey wait a minute i thought you said i
[2:02:08] was healed
[2:02:09] brother brown said i thought you told me
[2:02:10] you believed
[2:02:15] but i want you to watch the wisdom of
[2:02:16] the holy spirit here
[2:02:19] when john ryan got ahold of him and said
[2:02:21] look
[2:02:22] as a catholic
[2:02:23] i'm taught to believe my priest
[2:02:25] he said what he says i believe
[2:02:28] he said now what has been said right
[2:02:29] here he said i believe it brother brown
[2:02:32] said then i'm going to tell you what you
[2:02:33] do you go from right here and you start
[2:02:36] rejoicing
[2:02:41] you know you you hear little things as
[2:02:44] it comes out a little bit a little more
[2:02:46] perceptions of the story that people in
[2:02:48] the community were getting ready to have
[2:02:49] john ryan committed to a mental asylum
[2:02:52] they thought it was a nut case
[2:02:54] because he was out there months
[2:02:57] brother said months had went by
[2:02:59] and here he is out there with papers
[2:03:01] extra extra
[2:03:03] praise god for my healing
[2:03:09] you know he was he was following the
[2:03:10] word go on your way rejoicing
[2:03:15] he had faith but if that faith it had
[2:03:18] been stimulated and now what it's doing
[2:03:20] he was standing there on the promise of
[2:03:22] god it's in god's hands when it's going
[2:03:24] to come to pass but he went on his way
[2:03:26] rejoicing
[2:03:29] [Music]
[2:03:30] i know we can go into all that drop from
[2:03:32] here to there i know we can talk about
[2:03:34] all that but in reality he was the sixth
[2:03:36] sense in his life and about that time he
[2:03:39] got in the barber chair one day
[2:03:44] and the barber wanted to make fun of him
[2:03:48] he said uh i hear that you were healed
[2:03:51] i heard you over that media and got
[2:03:52] healed
[2:03:54] john said absolutely he said god has
[2:03:57] healed me about that time his sight came
[2:04:02] and he took out running
[2:04:04] his faith had been stimulated and he was
[2:04:07] standing there on the promise of god oh
[2:04:10] my he was not getting up the next day
[2:04:13] well i know better
[2:04:15] i ain't no better i don't feel no better
[2:04:16] i don't feel no better
[2:04:20] but he was standing on the promise of
[2:04:22] god
[2:04:26] and this is where
[2:04:28] in holding that
[2:04:30] sixth sense
[2:04:31] in our life
[2:04:34] awakened
[2:04:36] to that reality
[2:04:39] that it's this
[2:04:40] same sixth sense that kept paul
[2:04:44] got peter out of jail
[2:04:47] he's the same one that loosened paul and
[2:04:49] silas in their stocks it's the same one
[2:04:52] that
[2:04:54] caused the lion's mouth to be shut
[2:04:56] it's the same one
[2:04:58] that kept the hebrew children in the
[2:05:00] fiery furnace
[2:05:06] these are not stories to us
[2:05:10] these are testimonies in prophecy
[2:05:13] for the life of every believer
[2:05:16] that just as god kept the hebrew
[2:05:18] children where there was not a smell of
[2:05:21] smoke on their clothes
[2:05:24] that that same god will do the same
[2:05:26] thing for every one of his believing
[2:05:27] children
[2:05:29] and brother branham said it like this he
[2:05:31] said why don't you let that sixth sense
[2:05:33] go to work for you
[2:05:34] and he gives this testimony and i'm
[2:05:36] closing here
[2:05:38] he said you know
[2:05:39] don't rely upon those five
[2:05:41] because they're deceitful
[2:05:46] but rely upon that sixth one
[2:05:49] he said he got to talking with brother
[2:05:51] charlie cox he said i was talking to him
[2:05:53] on the sixth sense
[2:05:55] he said and he took it and believed it
[2:05:57] and played it on a tape
[2:05:59] so brother charlie took a tape and
[2:06:01] played it
[2:06:03] his wife
[2:06:05] seen that effect and she said give me
[2:06:08] that tape and i'm going to play it
[2:06:11] this is right here his wife said let me
[2:06:13] play it
[2:06:14] she run in the other room and started
[2:06:16] playing it now listen now here's the
[2:06:17] sixth sense she said lord i've got a
[2:06:21] sixth sense too and i'm gonna put it to
[2:06:23] work i want the holy ghost
[2:06:28] and hear it come what is it
[2:06:32] if you believe it
[2:06:35] however it counts but it's got to be the
[2:06:38] sixth sense that goes to work
[2:06:41] for the holy ghost for healing
[2:06:44] deliverance salvation on and on it takes
[2:06:47] faith

[2:08:30] i believe god you as your presence has
[2:08:32] already come by you've lord been able to
[2:08:35] take and you have taken things lord
[2:08:37] testimonies and situations and you have
[2:08:40] ministered lord
[2:08:42] to our hearts oh god
[2:08:45] lord we're asking
[2:08:46] that for each need lord
[2:08:49] that god made that sixth sense go to
[2:08:51] work
[2:08:54] [Music]
[2:08:55] may this be a moment lord where
[2:08:58] we don't walk out of this building
[2:09:01] the same way we came in
[2:09:03] we don't walk out and
[2:09:05] ask
[2:09:06] can i have my worry back
[2:09:08] can i have my doubt back where did you
[2:09:09] put
[2:09:10] this baggage brothers where did you put
[2:09:12] that back but lord
[2:09:14] may this be a moment
[2:09:16] that god is your children
[2:09:19] would move out lord with that sick sense
[2:09:20] for their need
[2:09:22] it doesn't mean lord that we ignore it
[2:09:27] but we recognize that the god in us is
[2:09:29] greater
[2:09:32] lord you know the needs of your children
[2:09:34] this morning
[2:09:37] you've come to encourage us
[2:09:39] you've come to strengthen us lord
[2:09:42] father if there be those lord that
[2:09:45] would come lord and desiring to be
[2:09:46] prayed for
[2:09:48] lord i i just asked god that
[2:09:50] may lord in their hearts before they
[2:09:53] would even walk up here lord
[2:09:55] may everything lord if there's anything
[2:09:57] that would be in the way that would
[2:09:58] hinder that may that be settled out and
[2:10:00] may they come lord with the faith in you
[2:10:03] not a faith in my hands
[2:10:05] not a faith in me or faith in this
[2:10:07] church that won't get anywhere
[2:10:09] your prophet talks about that lord he
[2:10:11] lays that out so clear
[2:10:13] but it's faith in recognizing that god
[2:10:15] is present
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:19] or maybe there's needs right here
[2:10:20] situations that
[2:10:22] got everything figured out but today
[2:10:25] they just realized lord
[2:10:30] that's where i'm
[2:10:31] i'm being defeated
[2:10:33] i've got everything figured out and this
[2:10:35] isn't going right and that isn't going
[2:10:36] my way or i'm but god
[2:10:39] may they recognize that that's only the
[2:10:42] enemy
[2:10:44] trying to get them to live by their
[2:10:46] senses
[2:10:49] to where when they're not seeing
[2:10:51] anything
[2:10:52] they don't feel any different
[2:10:55] i pray god this morning
[2:10:58] that you would so energize their faith
[2:11:00] that it looks beyond
[2:11:03] what they see
[2:11:05] it goes beyond what they think
[2:11:08] made that sixth sense lord be energized
[2:11:11] here this morning lord
[2:11:14] that like blind bartimaeus or like john
[2:11:17] ryan
