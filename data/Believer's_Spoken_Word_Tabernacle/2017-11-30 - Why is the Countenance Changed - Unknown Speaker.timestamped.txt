[34:41] hallelujah only matters that you
[34:44] testimony tonight God is good he is so
[34:48] good
[34:48] a man let's just look in the word of the
[34:51] Lord tonight I invite you to the
[34:53] Scriptures Genesis chapter 31
[35:05] let's just look at verse 1 verse 2
[35:15] verse 1 and he heard the words of Laban
[35:22] sons saying Jacob hath taken away all
[35:25] that was our fathers that which was our
[35:29] fathers hath he gotten all this glory
[35:33] and Jacob beheld the countenance of
[35:36] Laban and behold it was not toward him
[35:40] as before I want you to notice here in
[35:47] verse 1 and then into verse 2 there is
[35:52] an effect and there is a change that has
[35:54] taken place that Jacob notices the
[35:59] change of the countenance that's toward
[36:03] him so the countenance itself may have
[36:07] been fine with everything else and with
[36:10] everyone else but what was different is
[36:13] is the countenance of Laban toward him
[36:17] that's what was different and defined
[36:20] that how that God allowed all of this to
[36:25] come to pass to get Jacob back into
[36:30] position it's amazing sometimes the
[36:34] things that God permits and allows to
[36:39] come our way to get us back in position
[36:43] but he and his infinite wisdom knows
[36:46] exactly what he's doing
[36:49] amen let's just pray tonight Heavenly
[36:52] Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful that
[36:57] you've given us another opportunity Lord
[36:59] to be able to come together and father
[37:02] you see Lord the greatness of the needs
[37:05] Lord that are here Lord many of the
[37:08] requests Lord that have been mentioned
[37:11] here father Lord you know those needs
[37:13] Lord we think Lorna just receiving a
[37:16] text Lord concerning that of sister
[37:19] Elizabeth Collins Lord just moments Lord
[37:21] ago
[37:22] Lord how that the doctors Lord they
[37:24] they've they've just given her up more
[37:26] they want to take her off of life
[37:28] support they feel that it's you inhumane
[37:31] Lord but they're leaving the decision in
[37:34] her hands but Lord we believe dear God
[37:37] that it's in your hands so Lord Jesus
[37:40] were just asking Lord God for your
[37:43] presence Lord we're asking God for your
[37:46] Lord for your touch Lord your Healing
[37:50] Touch Lord to move down Lord for even
[37:53] now Lord even now Lord Jesus all it
[37:58] would need or God is just a nod from you
[38:01] Lord God
[38:02] just a nod father we just ask Lord God
[38:06] for our sister Lord we ask Lord that
[38:09] father that your presence Lord would
[38:12] just move there Lord father in this time
[38:15] in this moment Lord dear God we also
[38:19] want to ask Lord a special request lord
[38:21] for sister crest Lord your God I just
[38:24] pray that you'll just Lord give wisdom
[38:27] and direction Lord for those things that
[38:30] Lord they're looking Lord and
[38:32] contemplating on doing Lord father we
[38:35] just pray that God that you would move
[38:37] Lord that regardless Lord with another
[38:40] ball and socket but we're asking that
[38:43] you Lord would Lord move upon the tissue
[38:46] and the sinew the tendons ligaments Lord
[38:49] I don't know all the terms but lord I
[38:51] know just to pray and their God you know
[38:53] how to direct the stone Lord and father
[38:55] we're standing as believers together
[38:57] Lord and just asking that you'll just
[38:59] move our sister Lord and brother Dave as
[39:02] well Lord in the midst of this time Lord
[39:04] father we just commit Lord this through
[39:07] these needs in your hands and we ask
[39:09] that you would just Lord take your word
[39:11] tonight and just speak to us in a real
[39:13] personal way Lord deal with our hearts
[39:15] Lord and I pray that God you would just
[39:17] have your way Lord in the name of the
[39:20] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless
[39:23] you being seated I didn't get a chance
[39:28] to mention that to you before we pray
[39:30] but we're brother Richard and I were had
[39:34] to we took off there in the
[39:36] to noon as more towards evening
[39:39] yesterday when mr. krest we'd got the
[39:42] call and we went over to pray with our
[39:46] sister and they were brother Dave and in
[39:49] that time and it was much much more
[39:53] painful which you can imagine than what
[39:55] it had been on the the previous times
[39:59] and what they're looking at right now is
[40:01] possibly doing you know how things go
[40:06] some of you there's been with insurances
[40:07] and operations you know how things work
[40:09] when it comes to surgery you need this
[40:11] surgery here and this would be the best
[40:13] fit but because of obser days and
[40:15] insurance you got to go through this to
[40:18] get through this to get to this and so
[40:21] right now what they're looking at doing
[40:24] and we were setting in there last night
[40:26] and even when the one surgeon who
[40:28] actually just was there to put it back
[40:30] in place with just manipulating it
[40:34] they're they're looking at putting in a
[40:37] ball-and-socket that's actually
[40:38] connected so that it would it's in no it
[40:42] wouldn't be plastic it's a glass and so
[40:44] they're looking at doing that and they
[40:46] have possibly thought that it is with
[40:50] the back surgery she's had is that the
[40:53] back muscles themselves are weak and
[40:55] it's not allowing it's not keeping the
[40:58] hip in place and it's allowing it to
[41:00] slip back so it's actually moving back
[41:02] but you know I believe this with all my
[41:05] heart that God just does not put in his
[41:07] word concerning things in the spiritual
[41:11] when he spoke of those dry bones and
[41:13] sinew and flesh but he's the Living God
[41:15] and that same God still moves in our
[41:18] lives and restores what we have needed I
[41:21] believe we've got witnesses right here
[41:23] tonight
[41:24] amen I'm a witness of that so we just
[41:27] want to keep the sister-sister crescent
[41:30] prayer and also as I mentioned to you
[41:32] from a brother Chuck Collins he just had
[41:35] had sent this to me just moments ago and
[41:38] and I just read it word by word it's
[41:40] tough too long it says at this time
[41:42] doctors met with the family and and said
[41:44] that they are finished with her case and
[41:46] that they are asking her
[41:48] he wants to unplug the life-support they
[41:51] felt that it was inhumane to keep her
[41:53] alive but they left it up to her so
[41:56] let's just as we've prayed for her and
[41:58] let's just keep our even upon our hearts
[42:00] as the word of the Lord is being
[42:03] ministered when we look at this thought
[42:07] I want to just speak to you tonight here
[42:10] just take a little a little thought here
[42:12] I actually thought I was thought it was
[42:14] gonna be moving a little bit further and
[42:17] but the Lord just really directed me
[42:19] back to some things here within the
[42:21] scripture I want to speak tonight on why
[42:24] is the countenance changed why is the
[42:29] countenance changed if you look in verse
[42:32] 3 as we keep on reading here the
[42:35] scripture says and the Lord said unto
[42:37] Jacob return unto the land of thy
[42:40] father's and to that kindred and I will
[42:43] be with thee Jacob sent and called
[42:46] Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
[42:48] flock and said unto them I see your
[42:51] father's countenance that it is not
[42:54] toward me as before but the god of my
[42:56] father hath been with me so here is
[43:01] Jacob he he is very much aware that the
[43:05] countenance toward him has changed and
[43:08] to see how that God himself has
[43:11] permitted this countenance to be changed
[43:13] toward Jacob to would calls Jacob then
[43:19] to really begin to move in fulfillment
[43:24] of where the Holy Spirit was already
[43:26] dealing with his heart when Joseph was
[43:28] born to come on back to the land so when
[43:31] we look at this what I want to focus on
[43:34] is this this thought and this word where
[43:37] where that Jacob himself can see his
[43:40] father or the father's countenance being
[43:42] changed and this word countenance is a
[43:44] familiar word that we see you sometimes
[43:46] it's used as the word presents face in
[43:49] person but it's the word Pinilla and
[43:51] when you we look at it like we looked at
[43:54] it last week when Jacob had arrived in
[43:57] Iran he had arrived with much of a
[44:01] a great welcoming and a greeting when
[44:03] Laban found out who was there he was
[44:07] welcomed heartily it was just embraced
[44:09] and Laban you know makes a statement
[44:12] that you are bone of my bone you know
[44:15] your of my bone and your of my flesh
[44:17] you're my kindred and and what a what a
[44:19] wonderful thing what a term of
[44:21] endearment it was more than just a
[44:23] greeting it was to a term that would
[44:26] endear Jacob with with Laban and you
[44:30] know Jacob was aware of this countenance
[44:33] and now there is a there's a great
[44:34] contrast from where this countenance was
[44:37] to wear this countenance is now and when
[44:40] we we think of that you know the
[44:42] question that would arise within that is
[44:44] what has happened what has changed why
[44:50] is it that Jacobs or Labels countenance
[44:54] is changed toward Jacob now we can look
[44:58] at it and we understand that God is
[45:00] working and orchestrating everything
[45:03] behind the scenes but yet when we notice
[45:07] this as we go into the scripture here
[45:10] that it wasn't just something that
[45:11] changed on its own but there are things
[45:14] that actually set in motion to bring
[45:18] about this change and here we find that
[45:21] when Jacob himself the scripture said in
[45:25] verse 1 that we read when when when he
[45:28] had heard the words of Laban son so
[45:30] Jacob has heard these words these were
[45:33] not just thoughts of Laban sons but this
[45:37] was speech this was utterance that had
[45:39] been spoken by Laban sons and these were
[45:42] not just words that were just left out
[45:45] there but it shows us the power of words
[45:48] and the wind things that they have said
[45:51] are when we look at it that it says
[45:54] Jacob hath taken away all that was our
[45:56] fathers and of that which was our
[45:58] fathers has he gotten all this glory
[46:00] when we look at it they are
[46:02] communicating and saying things that
[46:05] really are not true but they within
[46:09] their words now look here Jacob the
[46:13] flocks have
[46:14] prospered not just under his care but
[46:16] the wages that have been agreed upon by
[46:19] Laban when Laban had fully recognized
[46:23] you know that I know that since you've
[46:26] come here
[46:26] that my house has been blessed they
[46:29] Laban said I've learned that by
[46:31] experience
[46:31] so here Laban is aware that really the
[46:34] blessing on this house because Lathan
[46:37] was already you know one who was a
[46:39] herdsmen a shepherd and so forth
[46:41] but it wasn't that that brought increase
[46:43] to his house it's because Jacob had come
[46:45] to his house and it wasn't so much Jacob
[46:48] as the man it was God who was there with
[46:51] Jacob for God it said I will be with
[46:55] thee
[46:56] so Laban noticed these words that are
[46:59] communicated are actually turning Laban
[47:03] s-- countenance but it's causing Laban
[47:06] to look at it in a different way than
[47:08] what it really is it's causing Laban to
[47:11] look at it like look he has taken this
[47:13] from me he has stolen this from me but
[47:15] he didn't it was firmly agreed upon so
[47:21] you see sometimes just the way that
[47:23] words can be projected and from the
[47:26] slant it's not altogether just the words
[47:29] it's the spirit that travels behind the
[47:31] words because it's that spirit that
[47:33] moves behind the words that can actually
[47:36] bring an effect when those words are
[47:39] received so there's no wonder that Paul
[47:43] you know it would speak about how that
[47:45] we are to have a speech that's not a
[47:49] corrupt communication and how that we
[47:52] can see that within this even though
[47:53] that Jacob and Laban here they are
[47:56] existing in the same plot of land or you
[47:59] know still around together but there's a
[48:02] separation there's a division and you
[48:04] know sometimes friends it's not so much
[48:06] a countenance or the person or the face
[48:08] of an individual so much sometimes
[48:10] that's very noticeable itself but
[48:13] sometimes it's deeper than that it's
[48:15] something that is deep within that
[48:17] though there may be smiles on the
[48:19] outside but the inside may be so
[48:22] troubled and full of torment
[48:25] but you see God is interested not just
[48:28] in how that we look out here but God is
[48:31] interested in how we look here because
[48:33] if God can bring it to where it's here
[48:35] then what comes out of here will affect
[48:37] here in a genuine way because of it
[48:41] smiles out of here and yet within
[48:43] there's something else we want to make
[48:45] sure that everything itself is lining up
[48:48] the right way and if we need help
[48:51] God is here to help us so when we look
[48:56] at this that words themselves and I want
[48:58] you to think of this tonight words can
[49:02] be sometimes words you know just like on
[49:05] a text and sometimes you know even on an
[49:09] email or whatever more you know
[49:11] sometimes those those forms of
[49:13] communication are okay maybe if you need
[49:16] to document stuff and everything else
[49:18] you know it's it's it's okay to
[49:20] communicate in that manner but sometimes
[49:22] things can be taken totally out of
[49:24] context and you get the one what did you
[49:28] mean what does he mean here what does
[49:30] she mean here what and sometimes you
[49:32] know you just have to put the question
[49:34] marks what do you mean now don't tell me
[49:37] I'm the only one that does that y'all do
[49:39] it too I wonder what it means because
[49:42] you don't always have I've got the right
[49:43] interpretation but you want to know what
[49:46] is it that is meant here well what is it
[49:48] that's being said and so when we look at
[49:51] it the words themselves received in the
[49:54] wrong channel and once you think of this
[49:56] sometimes into how that the countenance
[49:58] itself can be affected by wrong words
[50:01] and then there are other times that
[50:03] words themselves and they are actually
[50:06] true words but they're received in the
[50:08] wrong Channel and it can bring an effect
[50:12] on the countenance itself so just think
[50:15] of this for a moment because when we're
[50:17] looking at this here let me just to move
[50:19] in just a little bit here tonight within
[50:21] this we we recognize that here with
[50:24] Jacob the great parallel that we're
[50:26] looking at here is not only a speaking
[50:29] of how Jacob is being brought into the
[50:31] land but it's also prophecy of how that
[50:34] God would bring back Israel to the
[50:37] ordained
[50:38] place and position that he has for them
[50:40] and we understand that there are things
[50:43] that God it's not national force that
[50:46] puts the bride in glory but it is better
[50:49] the power of God but national force puts
[50:52] Israel back in its own land but how does
[50:55] it become national force when there are
[50:58] spirits that are anointing the nation's
[51:01] are you with me so when we're looking at
[51:05] this and I want you to think of this
[51:06] very much you know we understand you
[51:09] know very much maybe the term or the man
[51:11] known as as Hitler of who was but you
[51:14] know the think of it of how that had
[51:17] that the spirit itself those demon
[51:19] spirits that were released in
[51:21] Revelations 9 that Hitler and Stalin and
[51:24] many of them became channels for those
[51:27] spirits to be projected through and what
[51:32] they were projected at they were
[51:34] projected at the Jews but they're sane
[51:36] spirits and they are not just any
[51:38] spirits they are ecclesiastical devils
[51:43] they are projected at that of the true
[51:48] elect of Almighty God to think of this
[51:52] for a moment here in them in the first
[51:55] seal the Prophet says Martin Luther made
[51:58] the proclamation that all Jews ought to
[52:01] be run off and their buildings burned
[52:03] down because they were Antichrist Martin
[52:06] Luther made that statement his self not
[52:10] God Martin Luther made that statement
[52:13] there's some statements God made through
[52:16] Martin Luther and there's other states
[52:18] Martin Luther made himself same way in
[52:21] every message their statements that
[52:23] william branham made and their
[52:24] statements there that God written God
[52:27] made through the Prophet and what do we
[52:30] want Ian said that we must have listened
[52:32] friends God never intended for us to
[52:34] make everything that the Prophet said
[52:36] thus saith the Lord because the Prophet
[52:39] himself says I am NOT infallible is that
[52:42] right
[52:42] but when brother Branham in himself he
[52:45] displayed in the message his own human
[52:47] desires he displayed human desires for
[52:50] his chilled
[52:51] certain things that he desired to see
[52:52] them in and so forth human desires that
[52:55] he had there are things that even the
[52:57] Prophet would have thoughts upon
[52:59] remember even when he spoke about Martin
[53:02] Luther King and they asked him
[53:03] concerning that what did brother em say
[53:05] concerning that he said that is my
[53:07] opinion that's my thoughts are you with
[53:11] me now now I understand that when I look
[53:14] at everything that the Prophet himself
[53:15] when he says but I will take exactly
[53:18] what he has said but to see that how
[53:21] that within this this this doesn't make
[53:23] any other it doesn't break anything in
[53:25] Scripture because Elijah himself made
[53:27] statements that Elijah made and there
[53:30] are statements that Elijah made that God
[53:32] made through him
[53:33] is that right when Elijah said I'm the
[53:36] only one left who made that statement
[53:39] was that daughter was that Elijah Elijah
[53:42] so there a statement soul brother saying
[53:45] how will we know the Holy Ghost will
[53:47] bring all things back to our remembrance
[53:49] whatsoever he the Holy Ghost has said oh
[53:53] my Martin Luther made that statement his
[53:57] self in his riding now let me just
[54:00] clarify this real quickly I am not in
[54:02] any way sanctioning for a person to say
[54:04] brother bang said this here brother Evan
[54:06] did say this over here brother Brennan
[54:07] they say that listen the Holy Spirit
[54:09] declares all of those things but you
[54:12] know what brother Brennan was not afraid
[54:14] God was not afraid to show the humanity
[54:17] God's not afraid to disclose humanity
[54:21] because why it's not an infallible man
[54:23] it is an infallible God moving through a
[54:26] fallible man but it shows even within
[54:28] this right here how it's necessary to
[54:31] have the same spirit and be in tune with
[54:35] the Holy Spirit Martin Luther made that
[54:38] statement itself in his writings
[54:40] now Hitler just fulfilled what Martin
[54:44] Luther said my lord Martin Luther said
[54:50] it and Hitler fulfilled it well there
[54:53] are other people in that day that there
[54:55] were things that God spoke through
[54:56] Martin Luther and God fulfilled it
[54:59] through them there was there were things
[55:02] that God spoke through there that
[55:04] ripped ahold of the elect heart and that
[55:06] word became personified in their lives
[55:10] so to see how that within this eye this
[55:13] just meant moved me so much when I was
[55:15] thinking of this here of how that Hitler
[55:18] fulfilled words that were spoken by by
[55:21] Luther and Luther's words became a a
[55:24] catalyst catalyst by what that an evil
[55:27] spirit to come behind and an evil spirit
[55:30] to take those words and just somehow
[55:33] magnify them and raise them up to Luther
[55:36] or not - Luther sorry - Hitler and
[55:40] Hitler would go about to fulfill them
[55:42] and it would absolutely change
[55:45] Hitler's countenance think of how deep
[55:48] this is Hitler himself being turned by
[55:53] these words and it shows friends listen
[55:55] this is where it shows within this hour
[55:57] think of this in the Word of God here we
[56:00] have in the Word of God where the Lord
[56:02] Jesus is giving of the Great Commission
[56:05] and at the very end of it in the Great
[56:07] Commission when he says go you there for
[56:10] teaching all nations then baptizing them
[56:12] in the name of the Father of the Son and
[56:15] of the Holy Ghost
[56:16] those were divine perfectly spoken words
[56:20] true words is that right there is a
[56:23] great truth within it but notice when
[56:26] evil spirits come behind those words
[56:29] that's where the Prophet could identify
[56:31] it that it becomes the Trinity a
[56:34] doctrine of devils and yet there is a
[56:37] real truth in that word are you with me
[56:41] there's a real truth but it takes the
[56:44] Holy Spirit to reveal that that's why
[56:46] the Prophet could say in the cross the
[56:48] mystery of God revealed he said the
[56:50] devil has told you those things to make
[56:53] an idolaters out of you so an evil
[56:57] spirit is it possible I ask you is it
[57:00] possible for evil spirits to take things
[57:03] that have been spoken that God has
[57:06] spoken within this word is it possible
[57:09] for evil spirits to take things and so
[57:12] move behind those things and move them
[57:15] out of the right understand
[57:17] that they were spoken here absolutely
[57:20] there is that's why we need real
[57:23] spiritual discernment think about how
[57:26] that when we're looking at this we want
[57:28] to have our countenance that it would
[57:31] reflect the true understanding of the
[57:35] Lord now in Exodus chapter one verse
[57:38] eight the scripture says of how that
[57:41] there was a a new king that arose up
[57:45] there over Egypt which knew not Joseph
[57:50] and brother Brandon makes the statement
[57:53] like this and I I just have been
[57:54] meditating on this for a few weeks this
[57:58] this one who rose up knew not Joseph and
[58:01] the Prophet says that was the beginning
[58:03] of the beginning it just had to be one
[58:06] who didn't know it rose up first it
[58:09] started to set things in motion
[58:11] there are things that's why that when we
[58:14] look back there in in history and yet
[58:16] you find that winner John F Kennedy was
[58:19] elected there were things that started
[58:22] things in motion but right now we're
[58:25] seeing they were seeing the effects of
[58:28] things that got started in motion back
[58:30] there it all there was a beginning for
[58:33] it but notice where where it comes in
[58:36] now he said unto his people behold the
[58:40] people of the children of Israel are
[58:42] more and mightier than we
[58:45] he said so there are words that are
[58:48] going for it now notice what his words
[58:50] are doing his words are divisive his
[58:53] words are elevating there's nothing
[58:56] wrong with the word elevating and
[58:58] encouraging and lifting up but it should
[59:00] not bring dissension when the word is
[59:05] lifting the word is elevating there's
[59:07] only one thing that can truly elevate
[59:10] and lift which is edify and that is the
[59:13] love of God even when it is correcting
[59:16] our life his love is edifying because
[59:20] it's separating us from us
[59:23] it's him calling us to himself is that
[59:28] right because as we said before there
[59:30] can be grace
[59:31] he preached to such an extent which it
[59:33] is within the world among many of where
[59:36] things are preached to such an extent to
[59:38] where there's no more conviction at all
[59:40] and yet grace is a wonderful true
[59:43] principle it is an attribute of God but
[59:45] it's not the only attribute that's where
[59:49] Paul that the Spirit of God and Jude
[59:52] could say that there were men who
[59:54] prepped in among us who did what turned
[59:57] the grace of God into lasciviousness
[1:00:01] they couldn't say there's no grace of
[1:00:03] God but they motivated by wrong spirit
[1:00:07] turned it into lasciviousness oh my he's
[1:00:15] changing here changing the view toward
[1:00:18] Israel think of this of how that words
[1:00:21] it can change the view you know words
[1:00:24] can change the view toward somebody yes
[1:00:28] sir you can hear a little something on
[1:00:30] this or that it can turn it can turn if
[1:00:33] you allow them words to rest it can turn
[1:00:35] it can turn your countenance your person
[1:00:38] are you with me you see think of it of
[1:00:42] how that even when you look at Hagar and
[1:00:45] and and and and Sarah I remember when
[1:00:47] when Sarah I had the idea notice this is
[1:00:49] her idea
[1:00:50] this is not God's idea her idea of maybe
[1:00:54] this is what God intended to do and this
[1:00:56] is how we're going to help the promise
[1:00:58] along and we're going to do it like this
[1:01:00] her own thinking and when her own
[1:01:02] thinking comes about but Hagar conceives
[1:01:05] and when Hagar conceives immediately
[1:01:07] Hagar looks down upon Sarah she ought
[1:01:16] have been grateful but you see Sarah was
[1:01:21] despised in her eyes think of that why
[1:01:25] would she be despised in her eyes what
[1:01:27] was it did the Bible doesn't say that
[1:01:28] Hagar said anything toward Syria she
[1:01:31] really didn't have to say anything
[1:01:32] the pride within her heart such as I'm
[1:01:35] able to and you're not it has brought a
[1:01:39] change in countenance
[1:01:41] that doesn't take discernment as far as
[1:01:44] a prophet to look into the life to know
[1:01:46] something's wrong but remember what God
[1:01:50] said look at when Sarah dealt with her
[1:01:52] hardly she fled but what did God tell
[1:01:55] Hagar he said go back and submit
[1:01:58] yourself unto Sarai thy mistress think
[1:02:05] of how that here was with Pharoah let me
[1:02:08] come back to this Cairo goes on to
[1:02:11] continue to speak to the Egyptians in
[1:02:14] verse 10 and he said come on let us deal
[1:02:16] wisely with them lest they multiply and
[1:02:19] it come to pass that when their faileth
[1:02:21] out any war they join us also under our
[1:02:24] enemies and fight against us and so get
[1:02:27] them up out of the land where is this
[1:02:30] coming from
[1:02:31] fear fear so the first thing to do
[1:02:37] within that verse that we looked at
[1:02:38] before he's beginning to say they're
[1:02:40] mightier than we are he's beginning to
[1:02:43] look at them and their project he's
[1:02:45] projecting to them but here if they
[1:02:48] continue to go we don't do something
[1:02:49] they're gonna rise up and turn against
[1:02:52] us
[1:02:52] he's sowing seeds to do what turn the
[1:02:55] countenance of the Egyptians toward
[1:02:58] Israel and God is allowing it God is
[1:03:05] permitting it because God has a promise
[1:03:07] that's going to be fulfilled I think of
[1:03:10] what the Prophet said in proving his
[1:03:12] words he said Israel did not know what
[1:03:14] they were gonna have to go through in
[1:03:15] order for that promise to be fulfilled
[1:03:17] oh my aren't you glad that God doesn't
[1:03:21] let us know every step of the way
[1:03:23] oh yes sir all we have to know we walked
[1:03:27] by faith
[1:03:29] so here the Egyptians actually by these
[1:03:33] words their pride is actually being
[1:03:35] lifted but friends there's one thing
[1:03:37] that is so true about pride pride itself
[1:03:40] is the result of fear when people are
[1:03:44] fearful pride rises up it always goes
[1:03:48] hand in hand together there is just
[1:03:51] something that's there some some
[1:03:53] the fear pride will rise up so this word
[1:03:55] what is this we're doing out of fear it
[1:03:58] is causing the people to rise up and
[1:04:00] look down upon Israel hmm therefore they
[1:04:07] did set them task masters to afflict
[1:04:09] them with their burdens they built for
[1:04:11] pharaoh treasure cities plank them and
[1:04:13] RAM premises but the more they afflicted
[1:04:16] them the more they multiplied and grew
[1:04:19] Oh God
[1:04:22] let that be our testimony I don't want
[1:04:27] it to read but the more that they
[1:04:28] afflicted the more Samuel complained and
[1:04:35] they were grieved because of the
[1:04:38] children of Israel that very word grieve
[1:04:40] means to a bore through the idea of
[1:04:43] suffering oneself
[1:04:45] they were so grief so the word this
[1:04:47] propaganda all of these things that had
[1:04:50] been sown within there had literally
[1:04:52] been able to turn the countenance of the
[1:04:55] Egyptians toward the Israelites listen
[1:04:59] friends that same thing has been going
[1:05:00] on it's been going on for a long time
[1:05:04] and that same thing is still going on
[1:05:06] right now we're seeing things being
[1:05:08] spoken more vividly more clear and
[1:05:12] everything else when it comes to the
[1:05:14] very term of Christians let alone when
[1:05:18] it gets down to real message believers
[1:05:21] they already have a problem with
[1:05:24] different ones and how they stand on
[1:05:25] marriage and how they stand on different
[1:05:27] things but let alone when it comes down
[1:05:29] to a message that goes down and homes it
[1:05:32] right more clearly into the scriptures
[1:05:35] but God knows just exactly the right
[1:05:38] time everything in itself is setting the
[1:05:42] words themselves all the meaning look at
[1:05:45] this friends even in this hour that
[1:05:46] we're living in this time after the
[1:05:49] internet and everything has come forth
[1:05:50] it used to be a time you know when for
[1:05:52] myself when we lived down in the country
[1:05:54] out there from Lyman was more closer to
[1:05:57] the Indiana border there are things that
[1:05:59] you would see that certain styles maybe
[1:06:01] of sneakers and things like that
[1:06:03] that would be right here in this
[1:06:05] and I would go right back down there in
[1:06:06] that country school and I would not see
[1:06:09] those styles whatsoever there was a
[1:06:11] limitation but now with the internet
[1:06:13] it's no longer just a town township city
[1:06:16] it's a global village and imagery and
[1:06:21] all things are projected right through
[1:06:23] their words you can have things that you
[1:06:25] would look at in times past you must be
[1:06:27] in this city or be in this city and hold
[1:06:29] this city has more of a conservative
[1:06:31] stance or this city has more of a
[1:06:33] liberal listen the words themselves are
[1:06:35] turning and they are slowly and surely
[1:06:38] they have been turning the countenance
[1:06:41] of the world against the bride but how
[1:06:46] wonderful that mate that means it's just
[1:06:49] that much more closer to us come on home
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:52] the Bible was on to talk about how they
[1:06:54] were making their life rigueur they made
[1:06:57] it hard with bondage but you notice of
[1:06:59] how that when Rama seized was his
[1:07:02] countenance and there was a change of
[1:07:05] countenance and it was actually turning
[1:07:07] the countenance of the people that were
[1:07:10] there in Egypt God was getting ready to
[1:07:12] turn the countenance of Moses Moses had
[1:07:16] a countenance that was a countenance
[1:07:17] that I don't care what's going on down
[1:07:20] there
[1:07:20] I've tried I failed today it's not
[1:07:23] working
[1:07:23] but God was getting ready to change
[1:07:26] Moses caplets and through that change of
[1:07:29] countenance where God would reveal
[1:07:31] himself to Moses in the promise of his
[1:07:34] word then that weren't coming forth rat
[1:07:37] down in there in Egypt would bring a
[1:07:39] change into the countenance of the
[1:07:41] people they were groaning and sighing
[1:07:44] under that under this great burden they
[1:07:46] had come to that place but when they're
[1:07:48] leaving out of there you do not read
[1:07:50] that they were groaning inside but what
[1:07:53] you read is they were going and
[1:07:55] borrowing Jews and treasures and all of
[1:07:58] those things and they were not just
[1:08:00] being asked to leave they were being
[1:08:02] told to leave something that they
[1:08:04] desired Egypt had finally come to a
[1:08:07] place to say get out of here
[1:08:09] we don't want to hear no more that's
[1:08:12] exactly the where the world has come to
[1:08:14] right now the world is screaming out get
[1:08:17] out of here we don't want you here no
[1:08:19] more and the earth is sad sons of God
[1:08:23] yes get out of here so you can come back
[1:08:26] and I can receive my final
[1:08:29] transformation ah ha so words themselves
[1:08:34] are very powerful they can bring a
[1:08:36] change of countenance both good and evil
[1:08:41] mama notice how Paul deals with this
[1:08:45] here in Galatians 4:12 there has been
[1:08:48] some brother and that have come among
[1:08:50] the church and they have come among
[1:08:53] there but they have not come to edify or
[1:08:56] to encourage the people but they have
[1:08:59] come now listen they're not coming with
[1:09:02] stray words but they're coming with the
[1:09:05] lack of understanding and that lack of
[1:09:08] understanding is actually going to cause
[1:09:11] the people to come into a place within
[1:09:14] themselves of dissension toward the very
[1:09:17] one that they need to remain united with
[1:09:21] I'm talking about United in that
[1:09:23] revelation now notice this in Galatians
[1:09:25] 4 verse 12 brethren I beseech you be as
[1:09:30] I am for I am as ye are you have not
[1:09:33] injured me at all now you know oppose
[1:09:35] already been dealing with them on how
[1:09:38] that they've you've taken the law that
[1:09:40] they'll all make you perfect there was
[1:09:41] it the law how doubt were the miracles
[1:09:43] done where the miracles done by the law
[1:09:44] Paul is asking them questions you know
[1:09:47] what questions do cause you to think
[1:09:49] he's asking them questions how did these
[1:09:52] things how is the change come about in
[1:09:54] your life how are you transformed what
[1:09:56] was this and now Paul is letting it be
[1:09:59] known hey be as I am for I am as you are
[1:10:03] see they don't see the condition that
[1:10:06] they're in the world not only has
[1:10:08] affected their countenance towards Paul
[1:10:10] but their word has altered the way that
[1:10:13] they see themselves
[1:10:15] what's it not words that that were
[1:10:18] brought forth there were words that were
[1:10:20] brought forth but it was words without
[1:10:22] understanding notice in verse 13 he know
[1:10:26] how through infirmity of the flesh I
[1:10:29] preached the gospel unto you at the
[1:10:31] first and my temptation which was in my
[1:10:34] flesh ye despised not nor rejected but
[1:10:38] received me as an angel of God even as
[1:10:43] Christ Jesus Paul is Lenny you changed
[1:10:47] you've changed towards me what's changed
[1:10:51] you towards me come on friends the
[1:10:55] Prophet tells us in a message he that is
[1:10:57] in you he said as a man I make many
[1:10:59] mistakes he said you'll see you see my
[1:11:02] mistakes he said but don't you ever lose
[1:11:05] confidence repeater God don't you ever
[1:11:09] lose confidence so here within it
[1:11:13] notice where is them the blessedness you
[1:11:16] speak of for I bear you record that if
[1:11:20] it had been possible you would have
[1:11:21] plucked out your own eyes and have given
[1:11:24] them to me am I therefore become your
[1:11:27] enemy because I tell you the truth so
[1:11:30] there's a situation and the word is
[1:11:33] discerning the situation because I tell
[1:11:38] you the truth things are changed its
[1:11:40] changed towards Paul but notice what's
[1:11:42] happening friends listen the word itself
[1:11:44] moving here right through Paul's a
[1:11:47] ministry we'll be able to do what it
[1:11:49] will be able to turn the elect of God
[1:11:51] and remove that gloom that's about the
[1:11:54] life aren't you glad about that that
[1:11:57] there's all there's many times there's
[1:11:58] gloom
[1:11:59] there's things that can get about your
[1:12:00] life but the Word of God can cause that
[1:12:03] gloom to go away
[1:12:06] they's Elias Lee look at this in verse
[1:12:08] 17 they seriously affect you but not
[1:12:12] well yea they would exclude you that you
[1:12:16] might affect them but it is good to be
[1:12:20] zealously affected always in a good
[1:12:22] thing and not only when I'm present
[1:12:26] what Paul is saying I'm not the only one
[1:12:29] who can affect you seriously in a good
[1:12:31] thing but the word that has been
[1:12:34] delivered that revelation as it's
[1:12:36] brought forth whether it be through
[1:12:38] Timothy or Titus or the different ones
[1:12:40] that Paul would mention and count them
[1:12:41] as fellow laborers that that Revelation
[1:12:44] itself could seriously affect the people
[1:12:48] of God the word can change the
[1:12:51] countenance now once you think of this
[1:12:55] of how that the Prophet would you know
[1:12:57] he admonishes this is a very familiar
[1:13:00] passage here within the message but it
[1:13:02] is an admonition concerning our lives
[1:13:05] and how that things can can move right
[1:13:08] in that can work to change the
[1:13:10] countenance program says love one
[1:13:14] another above everything love one
[1:13:18] another no matter what the devil tries
[1:13:21] to say now you're all one big sweet
[1:13:25] group now but remember my warning Satan
[1:13:28] won't let that stay that way no sir
[1:13:30] he'll shoot everything if he has to
[1:13:32] bring somebody in to make his target
[1:13:35] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[1:13:38] and sit him down and calls him to
[1:13:40] fellowship with you under the quietness
[1:13:42] and things and then you'll shoot that
[1:13:45] guy with some kind of a poison stuff and
[1:13:47] he'll start through the church with it
[1:13:51] so what is it that would cause an
[1:13:54] individual to move in that manner words
[1:14:00] words and a word can change a
[1:14:04] countenance it can absolutely cause and
[1:14:09] altering to that countenance notice the
[1:14:12] admonition don't you take sides with it
[1:14:14] don't you have nothing to do with
[1:14:17] anything else now remember what he said
[1:14:19] before no matter what the devil tries to
[1:14:22] say yeah there you can wreak and look
[1:14:23] and say well this could be true and that
[1:14:25] can be true but how do I know if it's
[1:14:27] true how do I know that the devil is
[1:14:29] trying to say look at what the motive
[1:14:32] and the intention is and look at that
[1:14:34] and it brings a discernment to what's
[1:14:36] behind it
[1:14:38] amen listen friends there's a
[1:14:40] discernment of spirit the word can bring
[1:14:42] a discernment of spirit and heat and it
[1:14:44] still can come with such a real love of
[1:14:46] God don't you take sides with it don't
[1:14:50] you have nothing to do with anything
[1:14:52] else you stay right loving and sweet and
[1:14:54] kind to one another pray for that man
[1:14:56] that he'll be safe too or that woman or
[1:14:59] whoever it is just pray for him and
[1:15:01] stick one with another so even though
[1:15:06] the poison would be spread it's also on
[1:15:10] us to have the right attitude what a
[1:15:14] challenge well this must be dropping
[1:15:18] down home I know it is because he turned
[1:15:22] me he turned me right here the other day
[1:15:24] when I'm studying and looking at some
[1:15:26] things and dropped it right in my heart
[1:15:27] concerning this notice in proverbs 25 23
[1:15:31] the north wind drive us away rain so
[1:15:34] does an angry countenance a backbiting
[1:15:37] time Wow an angry countenance Jesus
[1:15:43] walked into the temple right his eyes
[1:15:46] were full of anger but yet he fulfilled
[1:15:49] the scripture being angry and sinning
[1:15:50] not is that right because everything was
[1:15:54] aligned just right with how it needed to
[1:15:57] be alive you know friends the quickest
[1:15:59] way when someone begins to talk and say
[1:16:01] you know what I think about this in here
[1:16:03] first of all there are things that
[1:16:05] simply do not need to be discussed among
[1:16:08] us they don't need to be things
[1:16:12] discussed about what I think this
[1:16:13] brother I think this sister we don't
[1:16:15] have a thought coming are you with me
[1:16:19] this is not things that if it's not Paul
[1:16:22] is very clear within those things it
[1:16:24] ought to be things that are edifying and
[1:16:27] if there are things that go to become a
[1:16:29] backbiting tongue the first thing that
[1:16:31] we would have to do is that of an angry
[1:16:33] countless not something or we gotta look
[1:16:35] at me you know dead in the eye you might
[1:16:37] have to do that or you can just simply
[1:16:39] stand there and say I don't want to hear
[1:16:41] any more of that well it's the gospel no
[1:16:46] you mean it's the gossip I don't want to
[1:16:49] hear no more of it I don't want to hear
[1:16:51] your thoughts on it
[1:16:53] yet your thoughts might be as far as
[1:16:55] your words be true but I know that
[1:16:57] spirits can get behind words whew notice
[1:17:02] iron sharpens iron so a man sharpen
[1:17:07] a--the the countenance of his friend Wow
[1:17:14] how do you want your countenance
[1:17:16] sharpened
[1:17:17] do you want your accountant that
[1:17:19] sharpened to where that your countenance
[1:17:21] becomes abrasive to everybody else
[1:17:24] cutting toward everybody else hang
[1:17:27] around critical people and you'll become
[1:17:29] critical all right you can't lay around
[1:17:32] with a dog and expect enough to get
[1:17:34] fleas you stick around with critical
[1:17:37] spirits they come with you listen
[1:17:39] friends when they're there at the
[1:17:41] workplace they can run the boss down run
[1:17:43] this down and run back down those very
[1:17:45] spirits will come right home with you
[1:17:48] and you'll pick at this pick at that
[1:17:50] pick at this glory be to God sharpen if
[1:17:59] the countenance of his friends that's my
[1:18:05] desire Lord help me help me through the
[1:18:09] ministering of the word that I can
[1:18:10] sharpen the countless help me that
[1:18:13] within my home I can sharpen the
[1:18:14] countless help me Lord God among my
[1:18:16] friends my brother's fellow co-workers
[1:18:19] that I can sharpen the countenance and
[1:18:20] my countenance can be sharpened but I
[1:18:25] only wanted sharpen to reflect him the
[1:18:30] Prophet says stay with your pastor he's
[1:18:32] the shepherd
[1:18:33] you give him respect he'll lead you
[1:18:34] through cause he's ordained of God to do
[1:18:36] something now watch he says the enemy
[1:18:38] will come and when he does just clean
[1:18:42] that much closer together
[1:18:47] it doesn't take much to understand that
[1:18:50] there would be things that would
[1:18:51] actually calls it possibly to be hard to
[1:18:54] clean there's a time to be clingy and
[1:18:57] there's a time not to be cleanly there's
[1:18:59] a right way to be clingy and there's a
[1:19:01] wrong way to be cleaning the Prophet
[1:19:03] goes into that here in this quote he
[1:19:05] says when he does just clean that much
[1:19:06] closer together the one that the devil
[1:19:08] is using for an enemy will either get
[1:19:10] out or come in and be one of you that's
[1:19:12] all don't never plan among or talk or
[1:19:16] make yourself clannish Wow and yet the
[1:19:21] Prophet tells us in one place of the
[1:19:23] message that we ought to be clannish
[1:19:27] clannish in what way that we are
[1:19:29] assembled unto Christ in him alone but
[1:19:33] we are not to be clannish in our spirit
[1:19:37] clannish in our heart clannish in our
[1:19:40] countenance I would imagine I'm speaking
[1:19:46] to other people here that when you went
[1:19:48] to school perhaps you didn't fit in with
[1:19:50] all of the different sections either
[1:19:52] maybe you were outcast as well and there
[1:19:56] were things you were looked down upon
[1:19:57] and left then and whatever more it
[1:19:59] doesn't make you feel good now you can
[1:20:02] sit there and say brother Samuel did all
[1:20:03] that stuff that bad that don't bother me
[1:20:05] you're lying it does bother you it
[1:20:07] affects you listen friends the very
[1:20:09] thing within itself to brother branham
[1:20:12] himself the things that he endured from
[1:20:14] a young boy and a young man there are
[1:20:16] things that he still had to endure with
[1:20:19] mother think of it to even be able to
[1:20:21] hold a balance to where now you got
[1:20:23] people that are wanting to embrace him
[1:20:25] and wanting him to come but now he's got
[1:20:28] a hold of balance and not go over my
[1:20:33] it's really something how the enemy can
[1:20:35] try to work and put scars and then try
[1:20:38] to send those things in the opposite way
[1:20:40] oh my
[1:20:42] he says notice in there in 86 there he
[1:20:44] says if the brother you think he's a
[1:20:47] little wrong or the sister say Lord
[1:20:49] don't let me never have the root of
[1:20:51] bitterness springing up cause it'll
[1:20:52] affect him and it'll take the Christ
[1:20:54] right out of my
[1:20:57] fake to just have a thought to have a
[1:21:01] thought of it that the poison assets he
[1:21:03] said that that poison acids of malice
[1:21:06] and jealousy and hatred will just take
[1:21:09] the Holy Spirit right away from you
[1:21:13] realize friends that jealousy itself can
[1:21:15] rise so simple about one person looking
[1:21:17] at another person being rejoicing are
[1:21:21] being happy or being joyful and that
[1:21:23] jealousy can rise right up but it can
[1:21:26] move it in such a manner to say well
[1:21:28] they don't have no problems like me they
[1:21:29] don't have how do you know that maybe
[1:21:33] they don't allow their mood to be their
[1:21:35] barometer listen friends we all get down
[1:21:38] every one of us myself included
[1:21:41] there are times it is a sacrifice of
[1:21:44] praise and then there's other times it's
[1:21:47] an ease to praise there's other times
[1:21:49] I've got a press feel my feelings be
[1:21:52] only everything times I have to press to
[1:21:54] study it isn't that there is an
[1:21:56] inspiration but as soon as I move beyond
[1:21:58] that press and enter right in there the
[1:22:01] inspiration itself begins to move down
[1:22:03] and God begins to deal and move right
[1:22:06] through my heart but it isn't always
[1:22:09] easy it isn't always something that it's
[1:22:11] a I want or an I fear the enemy is
[1:22:14] always around to try to beset us in our
[1:22:18] feelings and in our thoughts but
[1:22:21] remember those things are poisoned acids
[1:22:25] you understand what bursitis tendinitis
[1:22:27] and a lot of those itis azar it's where
[1:22:30] things get going where they have your
[1:22:32] uric acid and a lot of things can move
[1:22:35] within people's bodies and can actually
[1:22:37] cause pain and discomfort and things to
[1:22:40] where they can't walk or move like they
[1:22:42] ought to move what is it it's things
[1:22:44] that set in their body until your sake
[1:22:46] would love nothing more than the set
[1:22:49] poison acid in the life to where he
[1:22:51] would run the Spirit of God away from
[1:22:54] your life and run it away from this
[1:22:56] place he would love nothing more than
[1:23:00] that
[1:23:01] so where does it all begin this is
[1:23:04] simple right here with our thinking
[1:23:07] when you think discern where that fault
[1:23:10] is coming from just because a thought
[1:23:13] comes in our mind does not mean it comes
[1:23:15] from the Lord come on somebody just
[1:23:18] because you're reading the Word of God
[1:23:20] and a thought hit you does not mean that
[1:23:22] that thought came from God are you with
[1:23:25] me so if this is true on the negative
[1:23:31] and we've looked at this part on the
[1:23:33] negative then what about the positive
[1:23:35] side let me just read a few of these in
[1:23:37] numbers chapter 6 verse 22 here Aaron
[1:23:42] and the priest are this is given for the
[1:23:45] priest that would continue on the high
[1:23:47] priest and those priests that would
[1:23:49] continue on this was something that God
[1:23:51] just did not want to be something that
[1:23:53] was just stated and well this is said or
[1:23:56] this is thought upon but God wanted to
[1:23:58] make sure that the people themselves the
[1:24:00] blessing was pronounced upon him and the
[1:24:04] Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto
[1:24:06] Aaron and unto his son saying on this
[1:24:10] wise you shall bless the children of
[1:24:12] Israel saying unto them the Lord bless
[1:24:14] thee and keep thee the Lord make his
[1:24:18] face shine upon thee and be gracious
[1:24:22] unto them I got to looking at these
[1:24:25] things here notice the Lord's the Lord
[1:24:28] make his face to become light upon thee
[1:24:32] and be gracious unto thee his face is
[1:24:36] his countenance his person the Lord lift
[1:24:38] up or exalt his person upon thee and
[1:24:42] give thee peace it's salt is person upon
[1:24:47] your life and give you peace that's the
[1:24:49] only thing that can give us peace real
[1:24:51] true joy is when we're in the presence
[1:24:54] of God the Prophet tells us an
[1:24:56] unrecognised presence of God he said the
[1:24:58] real true joy that I have this when I
[1:25:01] can pray till I know that I'm in his
[1:25:03] presence I'll tell you that's when
[1:25:05] that's when things dissipate that's when
[1:25:07] things flee away friends this is the
[1:25:09] greatest time thing within our life is
[1:25:11] prayer listen we can listen to much we
[1:25:14] can read too much but you can't pray too
[1:25:16] much
[1:25:17] I believe with all my heart there's a
[1:25:18] lot less praying goes on there's more
[1:25:20] listening and there's more reading than
[1:25:22] there is praying but praying unlocks and
[1:25:25] reveals what you're reading
[1:25:27] praying reveals what you're listening to
[1:25:29] listen various never been when the
[1:25:31] Prophet tells us there he said the key
[1:25:33] to the messages that God gives me is
[1:25:36] through prayer I tell you right now
[1:25:38] there are times through prayer where the
[1:25:40] sermon itself everything will drop right
[1:25:42] out I don't have enough paper my phone
[1:25:44] my iPad to be writing everything down
[1:25:46] has this drop it doesn't happen that way
[1:25:48] every time no but many of the times I'll
[1:25:51] take things but God made the inspiration
[1:25:53] is struck and I'll begin to pray before
[1:25:55] the Lord like I was the other morning
[1:25:58] when this dropped into my heart and I
[1:26:00] was praying and all the sudden the
[1:26:01] Spirit of God began to move down and
[1:26:03] begin to say deal with this part on
[1:26:06] countenances deal with these things and
[1:26:08] the inspiration of God began to flow I
[1:26:11] tell your friends prayer is important in
[1:26:17] many times I'm not even praying on what
[1:26:20] I'm going to preach as far as when
[1:26:22] something will come sometimes it's when
[1:26:24] I'm praying for needs that are right
[1:26:25] here in the midst of praying for those
[1:26:27] needs and the inspiration will drop I'm
[1:26:32] saying that because not that the
[1:26:35] inspiration is going to drop for you to
[1:26:36] preach a message unless you're called
[1:26:39] you've got a gift in your life but I am
[1:26:41] saying this that prayer itself as the
[1:26:44] Prophet would call it a radar prayer
[1:26:47] itself unlocks things how does prayer in
[1:26:50] Locke because prayer is us submitting
[1:26:52] ourselves unto the Lord and they shall
[1:26:57] put my name upon the children of Israel
[1:26:59] and I will bless them David said in
[1:27:04] Psalms 4:6 let me just read these and
[1:27:06] leave you with some of these scriptures
[1:27:08] I'm going to read there be many that say
[1:27:10] who will show us any good you ever
[1:27:14] notice how David in the Psalms when he's
[1:27:16] riding but David's able to hear things
[1:27:20] sometimes that are being said against
[1:27:23] him
[1:27:25] you notice that over and over
[1:27:28] David doesn't say well I had my bow
[1:27:30] earphones on noise cancellation there's
[1:27:33] some times where we have to listen
[1:27:36] there's a difference between listening
[1:27:37] and hearing David could hear it but he
[1:27:42] refused to listen to it there's a lot of
[1:27:45] things that the enemy can say was you
[1:27:48] got to make a decision to say I refuse
[1:27:51] to listen to it you're not here but
[1:27:54] refuse to listen to it but when God
[1:27:56] speaking we want to listen there Ben who
[1:28:01] will show us any good Lord look what
[1:28:04] David's response is Lord lift up down
[1:28:07] Vala
[1:28:07] the light of back countenance now let's
[1:28:12] put gladness in my heart more than in
[1:28:15] the time that there corn in there one
[1:28:17] increased glory be to cotton let me go
[1:28:22] on Psalms 21 6 or thou has made him most
[1:28:27] blessed for ever speaking of David
[1:28:29] speaking of himself as a king Dallas
[1:28:31] made him exceeding glad with thy
[1:28:34] countenance David's countenance is
[1:28:38] affected by the Lord now think of all
[1:28:43] these things that David himself
[1:28:45] experienced but yet David's experience
[1:28:49] of the Lord and it cannot be held in the
[1:28:55] same comparison to abide the grace of
[1:28:57] God that what we have come in contact
[1:29:01] with Finn's Calvary and the resurrection
[1:29:04] because what David would speak of David
[1:29:09] was speaking of even in that time of how
[1:29:11] that the word was affecting his life how
[1:29:14] that the presence of God was affecting
[1:29:17] his life but to think how that when
[1:29:20] Peter is quoting in the book of axises
[1:29:22] this is right in the time there of where
[1:29:25] the holy spirit to fall upon upon the
[1:29:28] Church of the Living God and look at the
[1:29:31] word that how that the Spirit of God
[1:29:33] would have Peter to quote this in verse
[1:29:35] 28
[1:29:36] thou has made known
[1:29:37] me the paths of life this readout psalm
[1:29:40] 16 now shall make me full of joy with
[1:29:44] thy countenance I will have joy not just
[1:29:49] temporal but everlasting joy with what
[1:29:53] that person what is his person his life
[1:29:57] the Holy Spirit they meant that I shall
[1:30:02] fullness of joy now do you feel like
[1:30:06] where you're on top of a mountain all
[1:30:08] the time anybody feel like that all the
[1:30:10] time
[1:30:12] no but there's still joy in your heart
[1:30:15] because the circumstances of this world
[1:30:18] though they can get bleak and darken -
[1:30:20] all sorts of things can come around but
[1:30:22] the joy remains the same that I know
[1:30:23] that I am his and he is mine proverbs 16
[1:30:28] 15 in the light of the Kings countenance
[1:30:30] his life and his favor is as a cloud of
[1:30:33] the latter rain bless it Psalms 89 15
[1:30:39] blessed is the people that know the
[1:30:42] joyful sound they shall walk o Lord in
[1:30:45] the light of that countenance I don't
[1:30:49] have time to read in Psalms 42 you can
[1:30:51] read it when you get home or maybe in
[1:30:53] the morning or something but David
[1:30:55] speaks concerning once again things
[1:30:57] where his soul was cast down David
[1:31:00] speaks where things are gathered around
[1:31:03] me troubles he's asking God and he's
[1:31:08] talking he's talking to his soul so why
[1:31:11] are you cast down why are you cast down
[1:31:15] but notice all David will move within it
[1:31:19] talent comes back David begins to talk
[1:31:21] about in this verse what wonderful
[1:31:23] counsel he begins to go into where he
[1:31:25] begins to remember things you know
[1:31:29] friends it's reporting it's important to
[1:31:32] remember that all of the great things
[1:31:35] that God has done in your life
[1:31:38] I think of how the Prophet talks about
[1:31:41] here he is brother brems says sometimes
[1:31:43] when I get done when I get down I go set
[1:31:45] in my den and I look at the trophies
[1:31:47] that he has given me and I remember
[1:31:51] remember the hunts so God allows memory
[1:31:57] the gate of memory to be used don't
[1:31:59] remember the tools the enemy would like
[1:32:01] to stir up that gate of memory as well
[1:32:02] but you have been equipped by God
[1:32:06] Nehemiah has spoken and said put there
[1:32:10] link that the bars the lots and
[1:32:13] everything on the gate you control those
[1:32:17] gates there right so here David he comes
[1:32:21] back around I'll remember
[1:32:22] and then David you know he says in
[1:32:24] Psalms 42 5 he says how you know it says
[1:32:27] hope thou in God for I shall yet praise
[1:32:30] him for the help of his countenance
[1:32:34] aren't you glad he just don't send a
[1:32:37] word but he is his word and that word
[1:32:41] comes to our hearts to do what lift us
[1:32:43] up change us if we receive that word it
[1:32:48] can totally change our countenance yes
[1:32:53] sir I've witnessed that I've witnessed
[1:32:55] countenances be changed in services I've
[1:32:58] witnessed it for the positive and have
[1:33:00] witnessed it for the negative not just
[1:33:02] here but other places that I've
[1:33:04] ministered you can witness countless but
[1:33:06] it depends on how the word itself is
[1:33:09] received there right there's something
[1:33:13] you don't agree with you know like
[1:33:15] brother Ram says that you don't agree
[1:33:16] with that then just he says you know
[1:33:18] just a lot of to my ignorant and throw
[1:33:20] it out but he said be careful that
[1:33:23] you're not throwing out see seeds
[1:33:28] because you know what seeds are their
[1:33:30] new beginning they pack within them the
[1:33:34] germ of life could it be to God
[1:33:38] if David goes on he says says it once
[1:33:41] again in verse 11 he said for I shall
[1:33:43] yet praise Him who is the health of my
[1:33:46] countenance
[1:33:48] and my god I will praise him because he
[1:33:53] is the health the salvation the
[1:33:55] deliverance the prosperity of my
[1:33:59] countenance that's what that's what our
[1:34:02] testimony is to be that the Lord is the
[1:34:05] one that I want and the only one to
[1:34:08] affect my countenance God's not asking
[1:34:12] us to put on a show he's uh nasca neuss
[1:34:15] to pretend David is not pretending here
[1:34:18] but David is taking the circumstances
[1:34:20] that surround him and he says but yet I
[1:34:23] will praise Him who is the help and the
[1:34:27] health of my countenance aren't you glad
[1:34:31] God corrects us he corrects us because
[1:34:35] sometimes our countenance needs changed
[1:34:38] so it's his word he'll come and he'll
[1:34:41] bring correction to our life they're
[1:34:44] right you know sometimes you know when
[1:34:47] you you see another thing sometimes
[1:34:49] watching it's cool I've watched it even
[1:34:52] you know with our own children and
[1:34:54] things like that sometimes they you get
[1:34:55] around and you think you talking back to
[1:35:03] me
[1:35:05] they don't go in this house that don't
[1:35:08] work here in this house we don't conduct
[1:35:11] things that way we don't conduct things
[1:35:13] enough you know then we don't work that
[1:35:15] way y'all won't do that y'all don't have
[1:35:19] things like that at all
[1:35:22] maybe I'm the only one Lord
[1:35:27] that's what Paul was doing in the
[1:35:29] Galatian Church their countenance was
[1:35:33] not the same so the word came to bring
[1:35:37] correction
[1:35:38] that's what Paul did in the Corinthian
[1:35:40] church when there was sin that they were
[1:35:42] permitting to dwell among them
[1:35:44] correction had to come and change their
[1:35:47] countenance they were puffed up are you
[1:35:52] correction notice Omaha in Psalms 98
[1:35:57] thou has set our iniquities before thee
[1:36:00] our secret sins are in the light of that
[1:36:03] countenance some of these I've loved to
[1:36:05] read the whole passage but I think it
[1:36:07] gets to the point secret sins in the
[1:36:09] light of thy countenance are you glad
[1:36:11] for the light of his countenance are you
[1:36:14] glad his light moves upon you even when
[1:36:16] it shows out things that might just be a
[1:36:20] little bit of leaven that a little bit
[1:36:24] of leaven leaveneth the whole it changes
[1:36:32] the whole countenance sorrow
[1:36:37] Ecclesiastes 7 3 sorrow is better than
[1:36:43] laughter for by the sadness of the
[1:36:47] countenance the heart is made better
[1:36:53] now some of you feel like you've got a
[1:36:54] scripture now that you said praise the
[1:36:56] Lord
[1:36:56] I'm manifest sadness all the time that's
[1:36:59] not what the scripture is talking about
[1:37:03] that's the truth
[1:37:04] some folks face they've been happy in a
[1:37:06] long time but listen to this
[1:37:11] what the right the writer is speaking of
[1:37:14] is that we're like the condition of this
[1:37:17] age where everything is mirth nothing
[1:37:19] against laughter but these very things
[1:37:21] is against and it's taken away and
[1:37:23] ignoring what the real purpose that were
[1:37:26] here on earth for and when that sorrow
[1:37:30] when that comes to the heart the lord I
[1:37:32] need you then that sadness of the
[1:37:38] countenance itself that brokenness it
[1:37:40] makes the heart better so sometimes the
[1:37:43] countenance has to be broken in order
[1:37:47] for it to be built up the same I thought
[1:37:54] we are leaving I'm getting back to him
[1:37:55] just hold on now
[1:37:57] look at this and slobbers 15:13 a merry
[1:38:02] heart make up a cheerful countenance now
[1:38:05] these two scriptures have seemed to
[1:38:06] contradict they don't write mu-1 write
[1:38:08] beautifully fitting with another I'm
[1:38:10] Mary hot maketh a cheerful countenance
[1:38:13] but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is
[1:38:17] broken you either said it one or the
[1:38:21] other and sometimes you said it one and
[1:38:23] then God comes back around and lifts you
[1:38:26] back over here is that right yeah you
[1:38:30] can get because the enemy can pile up
[1:38:31] bring up everything before you and if
[1:38:36] you entertain that in your spirit your
[1:38:39] countenance becomes cast down
[1:38:48] I'm Mary Hart what's a Mary Hart huh how
[1:38:51] does the Prophet deal with this with
[1:38:52] Mary and he says we ought to be the
[1:38:54] happiest people in the world because why
[1:39:00] our destiny sure if God Himself how he's
[1:39:07] drawn us to himself done the work of the
[1:39:10] kinsman and performed that duty in our
[1:39:13] life and we have been sealed by his
[1:39:15] presence we are to delight ourselves in
[1:39:18] that the happiest people in the world I
[1:39:25] think God was interested in that you
[1:39:29] believe that where the Prophet would
[1:39:32] continue to be moved by the unction of
[1:39:34] the Holy Spirit
[1:39:35] throughout the message in dealing with
[1:39:37] this very point I was reading here the
[1:39:41] other day brother Branham it just really
[1:39:44] struck me brother brand was talking all
[1:39:45] things he gets to thinking on the Brent
[1:39:47] said when I get to thinking on that
[1:39:49] scripture there's one among you oh he
[1:39:52] says I just get carried away
[1:39:54] as John said there's one among you he
[1:39:57] said I think he's the Blessed Messiah
[1:39:59] that's among us
[1:40:01] he's the blessed one that is performing
[1:40:04] the sign of the Messiah he's identified
[1:40:08] himself in our midst now here's Jacob
[1:40:18] and let's let's go let's come down here
[1:40:23] Jacob notices the change of the
[1:40:27] countenance towards him words of change
[1:40:32] the countenance of labor
[1:40:36] but Jacob even though he's still Jacob
[1:40:40] Israel has not been raised up but yet
[1:40:44] Jacob does have a testimony that in the
[1:40:49] midst of it he could say in Genesis 31 6
[1:40:51] when he spoke to Rachel and Leah you
[1:40:56] know that with all my power I have
[1:40:59] served your father see Jacob now look
[1:41:05] Jacob could have taken Jacob could have
[1:41:09] went the other way but watch how this is
[1:41:12] moving in this time Laban scantiness has
[1:41:15] changed toward Jacob
[1:41:18] but Jacob recognizes God speaks to him
[1:41:23] it's time to return home it's time to
[1:41:27] get back into position now his wives
[1:41:30] could have told him and said no you're
[1:41:31] not you haven't you haven't been right
[1:41:33] towards our daddy but they knew his
[1:41:36] testimony his countenance had truly been
[1:41:40] right towards Laban so I believe that
[1:41:45] this is what the job to be in the desire
[1:41:47] of a heart Lord I want my countenance to
[1:41:51] be right towards you and if my
[1:41:53] countenance is right towards you it'll
[1:41:55] be right toward each and every one of my
[1:41:58] brothers and sisters I will not make one
[1:42:00] serve with rigor where they have to run
[1:42:02] me down and do this and do that but
[1:42:04] we're willingly how I want to be a
[1:42:08] brother to the brothers I want to be a
[1:42:10] brother to the sister to be a real
[1:42:12] pastor to be a a real minister of God to
[1:42:15] be a real servant to be a real husband
[1:42:17] to be a real daddy are you with me - let
[1:42:22] the countenance itself let that be the
[1:42:24] test among the countless because
[1:42:25] remember man can look on the outer
[1:42:28] countenance that God looketh
[1:42:33] and the Bible says God behold if the
[1:42:36] countenance within and I want you to
[1:42:39] look at this here in Song of Solomon
[1:42:41] chapter 2 verse 14 I love this scripture
[1:42:45] o my dove dowered in the clefts of the
[1:42:51] rock in the secret places of the stairs
[1:42:53] you know what he calls you you know and
[1:42:55] he calls me my dove and doves are mates
[1:43:05] he the great dove has brought forth from
[1:43:09] our life that of the Dove and so he's
[1:43:14] looking at us he says o my dove one who
[1:43:18] is undefiled one who's blameless without
[1:43:21] fault come on before him in love bow out
[1:43:26] in the class of the rock or my hidden
[1:43:29] place in the secret places of the stairs
[1:43:32] having access into my presence let me
[1:43:35] see that countenance
[1:43:38] let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy
[1:43:43] voice and I countenance it sky this is
[1:43:50] what he thinks of us just as much as
[1:43:59] Jacob was able to discern labels change
[1:44:04] of countenance toward him and it drove
[1:44:07] Jacob away so is the Lord she's seeing
[1:44:11] the reflection of his own life and
[1:44:15] countenance in his bride it's not
[1:44:18] driving him away it's bringing him to us
[1:44:23] to do what lift us in rapture a change
[1:44:30] of countenance is important the word
[1:44:34] letting the word have free course in our
[1:44:37] life this is our desire it changed this
[1:44:43] countenance on mal Transfiguration the
[1:44:45] same word to think of it in this hour
[1:44:47] it changed the countenance as we looked
[1:44:49] at it here just moments ago it changed
[1:44:50] the word that came and it changed
[1:44:54] Hitler's countenance Amen the entire
[1:45:01] message releases the Holy Ghost among
[1:45:04] the Church of the Living God
[1:45:05] what is it to change the countenance of
[1:45:09] the people of Almighty God for what so
[1:45:15] where he can say no we can't be a part
[1:45:19] no longer you're coming home with me
[1:45:21] today
[1:45:22] this is rapture day this is the moment
[1:45:25] that I have longed for Oh God
[1:45:30] granted more Jesus friend in every
[1:45:33] little thing and our life don't let in
[1:45:34] anything at all don't let one little
[1:45:36] grain of sand don't let anything at all
[1:45:38] if there's anything within your heart
[1:45:40] that would not be right just say Lord
[1:45:42] God Lord Jesus and not just in
[1:45:46] purchasing that but Lord helped me shape
[1:45:47] me mold me prepare me Lord help me Lord
[1:45:50] God to be guarded against those things
[1:45:54] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:46:00] you are so mindful Lord of every need
[1:46:04] Lord God in our lives
[1:46:06] Lord undoubtedly Lord Jesus as we stand
[1:46:10] here Lord and we've looked into your
[1:46:11] word Lord sometimes we wonder why Lord
[1:46:15] maybe our countenance Lord is changed
[1:46:18] there sometimes the Lord God where our
[1:46:20] countenance within itself Lord that may
[1:46:23] be Lord God within marriages and between
[1:46:25] homes the Lord God and things Lord can
[1:46:27] be changed may be Lord countenance even
[1:46:29] between Lord God brothers Lord and
[1:46:31] sisters Lord
[1:46:33] but father I pray Lord God it may your
[1:46:38] presence or Jesus moving Lord God among

[1:46:48] in our lives in ordinary or to see the
[1:46:52] seriousness of this Lord God help us
[1:46:58] Lord I believe God that it's so
[1:47:01] important in our lives the Lord but
[1:47:05] their Lord Jesus is truly ministering
[1:47:08] Lord God that rightfully divides the
[1:47:11] word of truth
[1:47:12] I believe that Lord with all my heart
[1:47:15] there are things Lord Jesus that we Lord
[1:47:19] sometimes Lord can see where things Lord
[1:47:22] God have been misconstrued father help
[1:47:25] us Lord

[1:47:49] sudden Lord God a wife or a husband Lord
[1:47:52] with someone Lord can be setting Lord
[1:47:54] right in the congregation and something
[1:47:56] Lord God that father they never let go
[1:47:58] of Lord

[1:48:09] made right
[1:48:11] the Lord God they can't let it go
[1:48:14] I pray Lord that you help the Lord help
[1:48:18] him to see Lord garment in the moment
[1:48:20] like this that it's one of the great
[1:48:23] acts of redemption is to be able to
[1:48:27] forgive Lord to be able to move Lord God
[1:48:30] and reconcile Lord to lay aside ideas
[1:48:35] and thinking lord help us the Lord we're
[1:48:41] tempted were tested Lord God right here
[1:48:44] Lord sitting around in the Assembly Lord
[1:48:46] God every one of us Lord God maybe some
[1:48:49] of us Lord in our makeup is more closely
[1:48:51] Lord aligned than others but Lord God
