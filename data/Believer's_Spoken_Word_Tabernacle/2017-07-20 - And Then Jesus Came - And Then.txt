as it's here now Lord Lord how wonderful it was to hear the Praises and worship and the singing their God I pray dear God that you will now just guide us into your word that we may for the next few moments Lord catch a glimpse Lord God of of Who You Are and what is meant to us we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and giving all the glory to God amen amen I want to read from Matthew chapter 8 verses 14 and 15. and when Jesus was coming to Peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid and sick of fever he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them may be seated what I'd like to speak on tonight is then Jesus came then Jesus came here late Peter's mother-in-law sick with a fever there was nothing anybody could do for her there was no nothing that uh could break that fever and Jesus came and he didn't put on any big boisterous front or anything like that he just reached out the Bible said he just reached out and touched her hand that's all we need tonight is a touch from him amen we need a touch from him I think of blind Bartimaeus he was sitting along the roadside he was begging he was blind he couldn't see where the random said he was old blind miserable shivering cold and needy said he was an outcast to the public he was Outcast socially but then Jesus came along and when Jesus came along he received his sight remember he was crying thou son of David have mercy on me and they tried to they tried to quiet him trying to get him to to quit yelling like that but the more they tried to quiet him the louder he yelled thou son of David have mercy on me thou son of David have mercy on me thy son of David had mercy on me he was determined to be heard and Jesus heard him said bring him here they said come the master you come he said what what should I do for he said that I might receive my sight thank you Jesus said thy faith have made thee whole and he received his sight I think about John Ryan blind man and brother branham's time he came and was prayed for brother random said you're healed and he went forth from there and he still couldn't see but he went around got back in the line brother Brown said you're already healed then he said he caught something he was from a Catholic background he felt there was something he had to do so brother Ram says you go confessing by his stripes I'm Healed and so John Ryan went forth and every it said he he sold papers on the corner and he would say extra extra you Read All About It by his stripes I'm Healed yeah and everywhere he went he would tell the people buy his stripes I'm Healed you know the story that one day he went into the barbershop he was in there and the barber was cutting his hair and the barber began to make a little bit of fun and said I thought you got prayed for he said yes I did he said but you still can't see Don Ryan said by his stripes I'm Healed and he jumped up out of that chair because his eyesighted came what happened there brother random talks about how that he had prayed for people and then they were waiting on their healing and he talks about two women they were waiting for their healing and they lived up in the same area the same place and said they just kept confessing that they were healed brother Brown said what were they waiting on they were waiting on the angel of the Lord to come and fulfill the word of God John Ryan was waiting on Jesus to come he had already been healed but then Jesus visited him that day when he was sitting in the barber chair and out the door he ran he said the barber was running after him there was The Barbers Abram just some flapping on John Ryan him running down the street saying I can see I can see I can see [Applause] I often think in the Bible about the man who lived in the tombs how he was possessed by devils so many Devils that they called themselves Legion the Bible never ever even tells the man's actual name because the spirits the demons had so much control over him that even when he got to Jesus he couldn't speak of himself the demons were in such control they would bind him with chains and he would break the chains asunder they would uh uh try to restrain him and no matter how many men it was they couldn't restrain him physically Jesus couldn't have restrained him either but there was more than just a man that came this was Jesus a son of God and when he came I believed there was something a part of this man that that even though he was possessed by so many Devils there was the part of him in there that wanted to be free and I believe that's what brought him to the feet of Jesus when Jesus came and landed on the shore there and the devils said why have you come to torment us they beseeched him not to torment him but Jesus said because Jesus said come out of him and remember they asked Jesus could they go could he cast could they go into the swine history says that that Guardia there where this man was that they their economy was largely based on raising pigs and when these Devils went into this wine why they ran them right off into the lake and they all choked the Bible said Jesus came and done and delivered this man and he caused him to have such a joy he wanted to follow Jesus but the other people that lived around there they had caused them fear when he came and they wanted him to depart from their coasts Jesus laughed but he told the man to stay and go tell everyone what had happened to me can you imagine him going back to his home the way Jesus instructed him and telling everyone look I'm free the people the Bible says the people could see that the man was there in his right mind yeah but they were fearful and he had destroyed their economy and so they didn't want him there they had he wouldn't fit within their Church order they didn't want the move of the spirit of God in their midst Jesus won't stay wherever he's not wanted churches say they want him but there's those that bind the service up and the people up so much the Holy Spirit couldn't even move among them but to those who want his presence to those who long for the move of the spirit and Jesus comes and he moves among us [Applause] in the mighty conqueror brother Branham said when he was here I see a picture of demons as a possessed a young man and all the military force and might and the law could do was to bind him in Chains and he was so strong with this demon power on him he could break the chains of slender there was no way to conquer him the evil spirits had drove him from among Mankind and he made his home out in the tombs and whosoever passed by this way he conquered them all but one day there was a little man down the road the Bible said there was no beauty that we would should desire him maybe a little stoop shouldered man with hair hanging down around his neck and this demon thought here's the time I'll overcome that little fella and they possessed that man and out in the road they went to meet him and when they run to conquer him when he raised his eyes they changed their tune foreign instead of trying to conquer him they said thou Holy One Of God why do you come to torment us before time they know they had met their match the Great Mighty conqueror of heaven was standing present he wasn't physically big enough to break the chains he was not physically able to hold a man who the demons had possessed but in him was the power of almighty God who the demons has to bow to and he conquered this enemy that Adams Race Hereafter who are bound with such a spirit has the privilege of taking the name of this Great Mighty conqueror and calling him out y'all have seen my son-in-law Brother David Horner come and visit among you and sing and testify but I recall a day when he came to the church and he was sitting on the back row and he was so full of devils foreign and as I was preaching that day it seemed like the Holy Spirit just kept pulling me back and directing me to him to finally I think everybody in a place realized he's not preaching to anybody but David and so I just quit looking at everybody else I just looked straight at David and preach the rest of the message and then the Holy Spirit came down anointed me and spoke through me and said you know nobody ever loved you like Jerry did and then I said I didn't say that to embarrass you he says oh brother Jerry you didn't embarrass me and then he came up the aisle but he came up I went down he said he wanted to be free I began to pray for him and the spirit moved and began to call those Devils out by what they were and then it came down to the one who was the chief devil among them it is tried to pull him from my grasp and I just grabbed tighter on him you know how you would do it just pulled him in tighter where he couldn't get away and I said you have no power to come out of him and he began to make a noise like he was throwing up and he kept making this noise and out it came and he was free and you've seen you've seen the witness of it when he's come here to visit you he's a different man now he's filled with his Spirit but it's God's spirit Hallelujah he was bound but then Jesus came and said the captain free [Music] oh I think of another person who was bound by devils the Bible said she was bound by Seven Devils her name was Mary Magdalene and the Bible said she was healed of the evil spirits set free think about it there she was living the kind of life she was living and being being influenced by these Seven Devils to live the way she was living the 10 she was set free one day and all she knows from then on was to follow Jesus one time there was a woman in the Bible that had a blood issue and the Bible says for 12 years for 12 years she had this Blood issue you imagine her 12 years how weak she would be but then Jesus came and she reached out and touched the Hem of His Garment and he said who touched me this I was told there's so many people around why would you say who touched you you're brushing up against so many people he said no I first I see virtue I feel virtue that has gone from me then when the woman the Bible said scenes she couldn't hide she came forward trembling and said it was me and Jesus said thy faith has made thee whole but the Bible said as soon as she touched the Hem of His Garment the blood flow was fast it stopped we were my family was going through dark time one of the children we had adopted about 16 at the time and he was just bringing a lot of stress on us take off and stay out till 3 A.M in the morning sneak out the house wouldn't come back wouldn't do any wouldn't do anything we told him and it was far worse than what I can describe to you here the things that was going on and it brought such a stress on my wife till her blood issue wouldn't stop she went to doctors and they were trying to figure out what was wrong with her and the doctors couldn't find what it was and she would get weak when we would go walking she could walk a little bit and then she'd have to stop and rest she said I'm weak my heart's just pounding you imagine losing so much blood the word they have to give you iron and give you blood transfusions and and so on and it just wouldn't stop and they couldn't figure out none of the doctors figure out what it was within one day a door opened up for this young boy to go back and live with his birth mother and when he left the blood issue stopped now it wasn't just him leaving it's because Jesus came on the scene he was the one that directed all that it was because Jesus brought all this about and it stopped it when we went through that I thought more and more about that woman in the Bible and what she must have been going through what she felt being so many years the doctors brother random said she went to doctors and positions couldn't figure it out but then Jesus came Hallelujah I tell you friends I don't know what I do my life if Jesus didn't come brother random said when Jesus received the Holy Ghost the devil took him out into the Wilderness 40 days to tempt him he says it in the message Victory Day preached in 60 1963 April the 21st 1963 Victory Day and he said but then the word came and said get me behind me Satan see Satan was there quoting the word wouldn't cast herself down off this Pinnacle for the Dozen the word say that he's given his angels charge over you lest you dash your foot against the stone but then the word spoke thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God brother random said it was v-day it was vide Victory Day he said he comes to every v-day anytime we have a victory in our life it's because Jesus came by [Applause] the Bible talks about a man who came to Jesus was bidding Jesus to come to his home because his daughter lays sick while he was bitten Jesus to come that's when the woman touched the hymn of Jesus garment and then after Jesus spoke to the woman then a servant from the man came and said don't trouble the master anymore your daughter's dead and Jesus said only believe only believe and he went to the house and they were well in the morning and and crying and he said she's not dead she sleeps remember the Bible said they laughed him to scorn he just put him out reminds me of brother when I'm saying that about him and brother Neville going trying to pull different people in he says we're pulling them in and God's kicking them out he ran out all the unbelievers he'll always run out all the unbelievers you don't have to worry about them they won't stay in your midst very long then he took her by the hand and said daughter arise she rose up and he said give her some meat to eat Hallelujah she there she laid but brother I've said then Jesus came there was a leper the Bible talks about they came to Jesus kneeling down and said if thou will make me clean Jesus put forth his hand and touched him Jesus said I will be thou clean and immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy in Mark the seventh chapter it talks about a young man young boy was deaf and dumb it was deaf couldn't hear and he couldn't speak and they brought him before Jesus the Bible says Jesus Took and stuck his fingers in the boy's ears and then spit on his hand and and struck it onto the boy's tongue and the boy was healed then Jesus came he couldn't hear he couldn't speak but then Jesus came and it changed his life Jesus charged them don't go away go straight away don't tell anyone but the scripture said the more he charged them the more they told him till they noised it abroad that he could even heal the death and the dumb possessing the gates of the enemy brother Brenham says the Royal Sea was born he was tempted in every manner like we are just as you have to be tempted so was he the devil quickly taken him when he received the Holy Ghost Into the Wilderness for 40 days and nights to be tempted and when he come out and at his death they drove Nails in his hands and spit in his face and he went through every sickness but when he was here on Earth he proved he could conquer sickness when Peter's wife mother lay sick of Halsey he touched her hand and the fever left her when the leper cried at the gate unclean unclean if you will you can make me call he said I will be thy whole he conquered and took the Gate of leprosy he took the Gate of fevers he made every every nature obey him he was the Seed of Abraham the Royal seed the one promised was given to through him Abraham all the seed that followed him up to the Royal seed and all the seed after him God promised is true he conquered sickness he conquered Temptation when the enemy spit in his face and smote his Jaws he turned the other side when they jerked his beard in his face and spit on him he never riled back he conquered a gate of Temptation and took it then you say my temper wouldn't let me do it you Seed of Abraham yes sir he conquered it for you when he was riled up he riled not back when he was made fun of he held his peace when he was called the devil he held his peace he had one business and that was the father's business and he went about doing that and then finally they took him to a cross death had to face him all the rest of them had conquered Seas they had conquered nature they had conquered Lions they had conquered fire they had conquered everything but death but here was one beating in his brain his veins and they had he had the Conquering power of death so they took his hands and stretched him out and nailed him to a cross they beat him they striped him till his bones stared at him but when he did and they'll they done it all that they could do that struck him so now I'll take you like I did Joshua I'll take you like I did Daniel I'll do all this because I'll make you die and he died to the son got ashamed of itself he died until nature got ashamed and failed to operate the sun went down in the middle of the day the Stars wouldn't come out he died until the elements were so black you couldn't see the hand before you in the middle of the day I imagine nature said let me die with him brother when that devil sent his precious Soul into the bottomless pit of Hell there the gates opened imagine hell there was a place and the Bible calls it in the Old Testament A Place Called Paradise but it was a prison where all those that died under the blood of bulls and goats were held captive but then Jesus came into the pits of Hell Jesus came and he set the captives free on the third day when he arose they arose with him Hallelujah hell had no power over him remember in the scripture in Revelations he said stood there and he said I have the keys of death and of hell Hallelujah he conquered death hell in the grave message of what thinking of Christ he said if I should ask little Georgie Carter laying Yonder what thinking of Christ laying there nine years and eight months without even a stick of Hope then Jesus came along and made her perfectly well what if I could call E Howard cattle candle here in Indianapolis a drunken sought laying out yondered flies blowing on him when he was laid in the bar room when he walked down into the bottom of his church where the Democratic relatives throwed his own Mother's picture on his scrap Heap down there tears rolling down his eyes what think ye of Christ Rose him up and sent him thousands of souls that drunkard what did God do for him it's amazing grace what he give Howard candle not only that but every man and woman in here wretched and blind you you've been had been maybe a prostitute on the street if it hadn't been for Jesus Christ the son of God

Jesus came and set the captive free the same Lord Jesus that did that can do tonight as he did then [Applause] pardon me uh-huh message seven compound names of Jehovah there was little drivers he believed in his heart secretly he sent for the doctor and the doctor done all he could and then his little girl had died and they laid her out the darkest time he ever seen then Jesus came along just in that crucial moment Martha and Mary The Darkest Hour that little family had ever seen after leaving and Lazarus and they believed on Jesus and Jesus walked away and left them in a crisis when the boy was sick and then the boy got sick and Jesus slept that was horrible they sent for him he wouldn't come he went further and they sent for him again and he still didn't come and that was still worse and then after all hope was gone then Lazarus died buried in the grave four days already decaying and in the darkest hour all Hope's gone everything else then Jesus comes along just at that time

the Lord was leading tonight God was declaring sovereignty it wasn't any of those that was within the scripture that was Worthy of him to come by their way their need their situation was beyond any hope I would say here tonight that even if you feel like you have your situation under control that's a sign it's out of control there is no control outside of the Holy Spirit there is no control outside of the Lord there is no Deliverance outside of him no healing outside [Music] I think of when here today has been resonating in my heart in the past the past two days the scripture that brother Jerry referred to it here tonight and I've been thinking about I couldn't get away from it tonight the whole time today this could get away was with jairus's daughter [Music] you know when he made an effort to get to where Jesus was because he heard about Jesus he knew that's the only hope but in the midst of him calling the Bible says there was one who came to him and told him he said that daughters dead why trouble us thou the master any further I'm going to tell you your need is not any trouble to the master your situation is not any trouble to him as a matter of fact your need your situation what you have need of is what has made his reputation is healer he's a deliverer he's a savior Redeemer he's a god he's a shepherd your need is what allows him to make himself known to you who he is so anything that any thought that comes around I prayer before why trouble is not reject that thought and take the words of the Lord Jesus that he spoke to Jairus and he spoke to him be Not Afraid only believe fear will paralyze it'll keep you but faith from the word of God tonight that has went forth it directs you to that overriding gracious goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ and no matter your situation is mindful now I'm not going to take you to respond I believe the Lord I don't believe that Jesus came here tonight just to come he came here to change lives he came here to set
