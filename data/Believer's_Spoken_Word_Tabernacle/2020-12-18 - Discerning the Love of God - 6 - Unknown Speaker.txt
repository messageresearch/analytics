father we ask tonight dear God for each and every need remember different ones Lord in need sister Anna Miranda God you'll just continue to minister to her body father as you promised in your word you never told us that sickness would not come but you did say when it comes I will take it away and so father this is our confidence Lord in your word you're our protector Lord You're our our strength you're our Shield our buckler oh God and Lord It's in you that God that we find ourselves bailed in these promises Lord we pray that God that you'll just continue to minister to each and every heart may you come tonight minister to us Lord say what needs to be said Lord in the way it needs to be said help me to get out of the way that you can just come and speak lip to ear Lord to our lives I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you tonight amen as you turning in your Bibles to Matthew Chapter 5 I want to uh just greet each and every one of you it's so good to see you and um I want to welcome little Isaac Rigo amen it's his first time here and so you have a little faith and a little Isaac amen amen so we just are so thankful for the mercy of God and so happy for brother Adam and sister Bo and the Lord is so has blessed them we want to look here in the scriptures tonight once again and let's look at Matthew chapter 5: 38 the Lord Jesus saying ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain and give to him that ask thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said ye shall Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and his and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same now I want you to notice what he just said here in verse 45 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on The Good The Rain he sends on the just and on the unjust so he doesn't just this section gets rain and this one doesn't get rain this one gets Sun this one doesn't get sun but even in how that the sun would come upon the earth and the rain here how that God is pulling from that example in nature of how that we ought to express the love of God or how I should say it is to be expressed through our life it's okay if you want to say help me Lord verse 46 for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be you therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect may God add his Blessing to the word as you're being seated we certainly know that this Perfection that God would call us to and bring us to it's the Perfection of his own life to where through and by the grace of God we are led to repentance and how the spirit of God would move to bring about a a change in our life to where his life coming to Quicken that seed that life that is within us so it's no longer our righteousness but it's the righteousness of God God that is working through us so it's the Perfection of God this Perfection that the Lord Jesus is speaking of when we read through all these scriptures this absolutely is impossible for a mortal man or a human being to actually do this in a way that would be acceptable unto God outside if it being God within that life that would actually Empower a life to be able to tap in to this reality of where those who would speak evil against you yet you're able to pray for them to where that you're able to salute those who have not been uh real kind or have not been good to you and to salute them is to be able to Greed them those are things that goes completely against our flesh and in the reality of it is even when you've been born again of the spirit of God sometimes more than others but we find that within it even when you've been born of the spirit of God it is not something that is to go about Loosely in our life that we just take for granted that this is just something that as though that there would be no challenges we realize even after being born again you are still veiled within this body this is why brother bradam over and over when he would preach the messages on Divine love divine love and Sovereign Grace just that whole Cannon of messages and I don't know how many times I've listened to those messages and preaching on love and different aspects of it throughout the years and yet so many times as you come into it there's things that that you look at it and it will be just so inspired to your heart and it's just a little nugget that would minister to our lives in such a way brother brand would place it in this manner you know even when he talked about the maniac in Oregon coming on the stage and you know the bull and the pasture and the bees we're many of us are familiar with those stories of of the reality of God taking a hold in those times now remember brother B will tell tell us over and over he said oh if I could just live in that something that came down upon me and he would talk about that oh if I could just dwell there within that and you know there is many of us here that no doubt perhaps to every believer you've experienced things in your life where the love of God has come down and he's taken control maybe it's a situation that you really don't want to deal with maybe it's something that you realize this could be very contentious or hostile or there could be things that would just blow up and you're praying and here you are you're going into it oh God help me Lord help me not to speak my own words because remember brother Rand would say many different places even when it came to that Maniac in Oregon brother Ram says when there were when those challenges were made toward him think of it this man walked up up here under the anointing of an evil spirit and he called him a hypocrite called him said you're nothing but but an actor in many different words and spit right in his face but yet brother Bram said instead of despising that man I said I love that man now to think about this there was an atmosphere and I want you to catch this if brother Bram himself was not in contact with God the way he ought to be there could have been a different outcome in that situation because for you and I these are things that we must keep ourselves in the love of God because you and I do not know the situations even that we're going to encounter brother Brandon when he walked into that meeting he had no idea that that Maniac was going to come when he walked into that Pastor had no idea that that bull or even in his backyard with those bees and you think of it that within knowing that brother Bram even said in those times if I had known H like with the bee if I had known I would have went out there with a spray can and taken care of them ahead of time but you see situations that come our way we do not know what's coming but God knows what's coming and everything that God permits it's not about the other person it's about the molding of our character and our life as a matter of fact that these elements that we read about these attributes of love that they might become more preeminent in our life and the only way that love itself will grow and abound and it becomes more preeminent is by the opposition or the trials or things that come our way that actually bring about and cause growth because you and I cannot do this on our own but it takes us giving ourselves to God let me just encourage you not when the situation has come but brother bam said let us live in an atmosphere he said where it's an atmosphere of compassion an atmosphere of consoling an atmosphere that is ready at that moment in other words a life that is yielded and ready for God to step down and take over in that moment because that's what we need is a God to come on the scene but Sovereign Grace and take over in these times I tell you it's been so precious when I've witnessed that in my own life of situations and things and times and I tell you when it comes like that you just feel like there's just Supreme control at that moment because you realize there's one he's got it all in control and there's no the the nerves are gone fear is gone everything else concerning the situation it's just a wonderful place because you just know that God has it right in control it's just so wonderful F and then what a privilege we have as Believers to enter into this and so indeed the scriptures that we read we know that it is indeed possible and all things are possible with God and to Believers this is also possible 1 Corinthians 134 I want to read and and upon this scripture charity suffereth long and is kind in the Amplified it says it like this love endures long and is patient and kind these are some of the things I want to just move back into here tonight and deal a little bit more if God would help us with this suffering long and then into the part there uh of that of of kind and notice as it's mentioned here it endures long and is patient and is kind now this suffering long when we look at it here in the Scripture it means to be of a long Spirit it means to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish now these scriptures that I opened up with here tonight in Matthew 5 if you look at those scriptures you would look and say well that's with people that are are without those are people that uh would not even maybe profess to be Believers or would not even symbol a symbol Among Us right here and then we read here in 1 Corinthians 13:4 it doesn't make a difference difference here the love of God doesn't make a difference in saying that you're to be this way toward just those of the household of faith but the Bible says be patient toward all men and these are all these are the attributes remember brother BR would saying like this he says when he's picking up the thought of Faith being seen and he would say and seed is not ever the Shu he said faith in your heart is what God sees but he says your actions is what others see that's why he says You must love one another and by this shall all men know that you are my disciples you see when we look at this and seeing that it's slow to punish or to avenge the wrong you know longsuffering itself is one of the fruits of the spirit it's one of the fruits and to think of it fruit itself when we look at this to be longsuffering there there would be there would be no manifestation of longsuffering needed if there wasn't conditions that merited for longsuffering to display itself a person could say oh I'm longsuffering I suffer long I have I I'm just have so much of that but yet unless that is actually what is displayed in the midst of trial or adversity or when offenses come then it's not longsuffering you see these fruits of the spirit many of them are what are born or manifest in the time of adversity it's a time you know how it is when offense come the offenses can sting offenses can hurt and you can't sit here and say Well it don't bother me you're not being honest there are things that bother us if somebody says something about us or we're misunderstood or something is perceived wrong it bothers us what does it bother it bothers this guy right here but there's a part of it there that on the inside that really can if we can reach out to God and say Lord help me Lord in the midst of this time and help my brother help my sister and see when we look at this the slowness into avenge any wrong then we can find that the fruit of the spirit there of longsuffering will come out now you see it it entails uh uh uh that of offenses and you remember the Lord Jesus himself he said offenses will come offenses come from outside offenses come from inside you see the enemy does not care he will take into account any situation and this is where we need discernment of the love of God because situations come in that we can dig our heels in and yet when we dig our heels in we're losing sight of really what the focus is all about because let me just be very honest and very plain with you everybody that even comes here to this assembly or that even would be Associated around the message of the hour is not believers woo sometimes you might say well isn't everybody that know sometimes there are situations that come where you have lives that they will never be Believers you'll have make Believers you have those who do not go on and get sealed and with the Holy Spirit and yet here we are walking among them and yet within this here this will take the baptism of the Holy Ghost a new birth whereby a son and daughter of God is actually able to manifest the love of the father that's been bestowed upon them nothing else can do this outside of a son and daughter of God and it's not the ability or that of the son and daughter of God it is that where God's love pulsating through that life to reflect this so offenses are going to come there's no way to avoid offenses coming I know that may not seem real encouraging but the reality is if you think back to what we were looking at last week you have access when you have been born of the spirit of God you've got access to the Fountain of God you're tapped into a place a resource that gives you the strength to be able to address these things remember the enemy he he don't care he'll do anything he can to take you off track in any way he'll let things come he'll try to bring in try to bring in things and disagreements and whatever more and we find that you know but charity itself as it speaks in this scripture it is slow to write the wrong in other words words it's merciful it doesn't say that what has been done is not wrong it just it expresses that charity is slow to come and write the wrong meaning as it is of a long Spirit now look at this in the scripture in Psalms 145:8 this is a quality of the Lord himself the Lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great Mercy now this here David would write of this in a few different places he would refer if I can just refer to them without reading tonight he would refer to even the Journey of how God brought Israel out of Egypt and even when God would Proclaim his name to Moses one of the very first attributes that God would display is he is the god who is longsuffering and of great mercy and it goes on to say you know uh keeping Mercy for thousands and and will by no means clear the guilty now think of this God himself if if it was not longsuffering there would not even be a chance or an opportunity for somebody to get right if the moment that you and I think about it we are born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies if there was no long suffering the very moment whatever that when the age of accountability sometimes it comes in earlier life the especially in the Agee we're living in where they begin to recognize what's right and what's wrong at the very slightest thing when you say something that's not right or a lie is told and something begins to move at that part by that nature of that first birth and it moves at that moment if there was no longsuffering you or I would have no opportunity at all but God is longsuffering as a matter of fact you might have been a skeptic you might have actually been one who said well I don't know anything about this maybe even as a young person or an older person there could have been something that remember even brother brandham had friends that would speak and even the Infidel when he went to visit him there in Indiana he said the problem I've got with you preachers is you're baring up the wrong tree but you see look at the longsuffering of God the longsuffering of God did not strick that man down he was wrong he should have never spoke that way but the longsuffering of God what did it do it created an opportunity for the mercy of God to move down and to rescue that Soul that's what longsuffering is all about it's not about you it's not about me it's about the other person and you realize sometimes suffering long is not even about that person per se it might be somebody else's watching you on the job somebody else is watching you in the assembly and they're watching the way that their life is conducted listen people will not read the Bible but they'll read your life because what it is it takes the spirit of God inside of your life to give the Bible a real reality and bring it from a letter into a manifestation and people will watch and they will look at a living reality so without longsuffering there is no opportunity for forgiveness when God remember when God had told Moses step aside and I'm going to kill him here was the anger of God but notice this mercy longsuffering and compassion was made manifest through a mortal it was manifest because it was so resided in Moses heart notice Moses gave place to God God became the preeminent one in his life Moses was so I hope you're catching this he was so in wrapped in the promise until as he was so wrapped in the promise coming out of the presence of God he did not side with God and say you know what let's kill every one of them that's right me and you've had a good time man look how good we are I mean what a wonderful time these sorry people just wipe them off but no being in the presence of God the right way come on now not just going down on your knees and praying but really breaking into the channel there to really get Before the Throne of God to where you are affected in a way when you come out of there it's the long suffering of God an atmosphere of your life where there's a consoling you cannot go into prayer where you're looking down at somebody and come back out you might say well I've done that that's because you didn't pray all you did was a ritual when you really get into prayer you begin to lose sight of yourself you lose sight of your feelings you lose sight and you begin to get a focus on him and the right focus on other people you see this is why many things exist people people pray but they don't pray they never get anywhere in prayer well help me preach you see the reality is Moses had come out of the presence of almighty God you see what a what a wonderful thing how God when instruct us and guide us within this to show us that there is an outlet there is a place that we can go in God to where God is able to turn everything our thoughts our attitude even in the situation when we've been hurt and we get to we get to praying and go in there to a place to where we come out and it's no longer about us oh god brother Samuel what would the purpose of that be if Moses had not had that there would have been no going forward you see this is where the responsibility Falls for every one of us do you want to see the assembly go forward do you want to see the work of God go forward do you want to see it in your own life do you you want to see it in your family you see you control that you have a part to play in that this is where it's very vital and very important because if we get to looking at one another you say well this one makes mistakes brother Rand would pick it up in 64 questions and answers and say you make mistakes also so it behooves us to be able to look at it and say God help me help my brother help my sister this is not where we come come along and you know become a bunch of sorry people where well nobody can over come anything that's not what we're talking about we're talking about having Grace in our heart and being full of the mercy of almighty God as God could see the cross in Moses and could not step over it I pray oh God let it be the cross you see in me because remember he cannot and he will not walk over the cross he will not walk over his word this is why as brother R said when God is moving he said you put the word before him he said God won't cross over it you see this is a place that we have Lord this is what you've called me to as a Believer Lord this is my desire Lord help me Lead Me Lord God that I can be free of these feelings these thoughts Lord Jesus help me Lord to enter in ask him for help he will guide you he will help you in these things notice this here God would remember in Psalm 78 how that the scripture would say verse 38 but he being full of of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yay many a time he turned his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again you know it's something that when you can we can go back and reflect on the longsuffering of God that has come to us Paul would write in 1 Timothy 1:15 this is a faithful saying and Worthy of all exception that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief how be it for this cause I obtained Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should after would believe on him to life Everlasting no wonder Paul could write of an experience of the kindness of Jesus Christ being expressed to his life no wonder Paul could write with his Gra love wherewith he loved us look how Paul could write and say in capturing the longsuffering of God realizing this was a man who was persecuting the Church of the Living God he said I blasphemed in ignorance Paul knew what the longsuffering of God was he could bring that to mind so when Paul was writing this by inspiration as the spirit of God would Inspire him and say admonish the Believers admonish the children of God that they would be longsuffering encourage them you know we need encouragement we need to be reminded of these things Lord let me be encouraged in these things Paul himself was one that he could look back and say God I didn't deserve how that you were of a long spirit with me if you would have Avenged me upon me speedily the wrong I was coming I H stood there and I held the coats of those who stoned Steven Lord you could have Avenged me but the longsuffering of God why why was God longsuffering because there was a vessel of Mercy that was there no wonder you know brother Ram would put it like this in spoken words original see let me just referred to it for time brother Bram said somebody came to me and they told me somebody had said something bad about me first of all that was dumb I just I forgive me I don't know how else to say it but the Bible says you're not to be a tail Bearer Oh Brother s you don't know what Brother s so said I don't care what brother so and so said hello you make sure that you're a conduit for life not trash preach brother Samuel you see they came and told brother Brandon this now evidently the person you know even with learning this right here they came to brother Bram and brother brandham mentioned you know in that time brother Bram says oh forgive it and the man looked at brother randam said how in the world can you do that they spoke against you and against your family brother Ram takes it like this and he's dealing with predestination in this quote in spoken word he said what it is he says if I looked down here all the time I would get off track but he says what you have to do you've got to look to the end and he says like this that was predestinated to give me a trial see it's to recognize in that way how could brother Rand was this because there was some great genetics in the brandom family you know better than that because you know about the genetics that was there when the teacher gave him a string to tie around his finger to help him control his temper eventually he just threw the string down he needed something greater than any mediation of man he needed a mediator he need needed the Lord Jesus to come down and bring a real salvation and a real New Birth in his life to give him power and authority now to look at this here how that he would look at it and I think that we can draw from this in this manner that it's Satan's desire to get our Focus off of the end that's his desire because wherever you get focused you'll find your affections you'll find your emotions you'll find your dinner table talk James 1 verse 19 wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak I know very simple two ears one mouth some may be bigger than others but two ears one mouth Swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God he that is slow Proverbs 14:29 he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding but he that is of hasty Spirit exalteth Folly remember this is a quality of God to be slow to anger Proverbs 15:18 a wrathful man stirreth up Strife but he that is SL W to anger appeaseth Strife this word appeases is the same word that describes the rest that came into the promised land when the land had rest notice in the scripture in Proverbs 16:32 I know I'm moving along but he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty wow better than the mighty so whoever the mightiest would be Mighty in this here in the Hebrew is strong a strong one my you know it's always showed to be great strength and strong one when we can get our point across or to avenge our wrong sometimes the avenging of our wrong is we just got to get our side out hello somebody it's the avenging of wrong but so so the slow to wrath is this possible sure it is now I realize I realize as I speak here tonight that depending on the back ground and the makeup and I'm talking to those who are born again there can even be struggles within these things of where there can actually be somewhat of a battle where different ones would fight but greater is he that is in you when you know your weakness don't let the devil beat you up about it just keep it covered by the blood of Jesus Christ just stay in that place to say Lord I need you you see God allows those things about you and I to where we don't get too puffed up and too big and to where that we get to say I got this I can handle this on my own no we don't got this he's got us so notice he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city it's one thing to take a city that's a great feat but it's another thing to be able to rule it the gates that come in in our spirit think of how Paul would write and say in in Romans 6 let not sin therefore reign in your members rain meaning to exercise a kingly influence when a wrong has been done without without getting a thing out if you begin to give it place in your spirit and in your mind you find it start building and it starts to affect everything about your life it can affect even how you respond to somebody else that has nothing to do with the person who wronged you oh God help us to rule our spirit help us to rule it help us to have like Nehemiah where they had they assembled there of the gates there in the wall where the gates were burnt down Nehemiah made sure that those Gates were restored may God help us that those Gates will stand like Nehemiah where Nehemiah could say you're not coming in on the Sabbath day and sailing inside of Jerusalem and if I catch you standing outside the gate I'm going kill you don't you come around the city in the time of the Sabbath let me tell you something the Sabbath is not a day of the week for us it is the rest of the Holy Ghost and we have authority to say I don't want none of that stuff here you're not coming into any of my inlets you're not I don't even want to see you around my city so here it's not quick to respond this is what it would mean to suffer long not quick to respond so we we must be built up in the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ you ever find how easy it is to forgive people or to allow offenses to pass if you've been in really in prayer with God when you've really been in fellowship with God it's one of those things that really I mean people could say things to you but there your heart is so filled with the love of God it's just like something it just almost like it reverberates right off of you it's something about it that you you you there's something that's so much greater y'all don't think I'm talking fantasy do you how many know what I'm talking about out where you come into a place and here maybe you come out of your prayer time or out of you know studying or looking at things and you come out of there and there's not one little thing that can poke within that you know where you've been you have not been just in your bedroom or your prayer closet you have passed from this Earth you have went Before the Throne of almighty God you have been affected like Moses was affected oh God let us make more trips there this is where we need to live now notice here so to how we look at this you know to be quick we're you know in a time and an age and you know it's been as we read in the scriptures here you know quick to avenge wrongs and things you know I got to say this or I got to say that and we find out that even uh with people that maybe they got a small mouth here but they got a big mouth on Facebook or they got a small mouth here and a big mouth on Twitter and they want they want let everybody know their opinion you know that's like this that's like me walking out in the parking lot and you chasing me down to tell me what you think about my tires I really don't care I don't want to know your opinion if I asked for it then I'd ask for it woo that's free see quick responses you find things where where where people can be it's such you know revengeful and you know saying this and man they got to get their point across here and get their point across there but Samuel I've got people like that on my Facebook what should I do by the love of God defriend them because if it's going to Rouse chaos and turmoil look these are things that we have to know as Sons and Daughters of God that I don't want that stuff coming into my home I don't want it into my mind I I don't want it into my life I have got enough challenge with this guy right here I do not need firewood from anywhere else I don't need seeds from anywhere else this is why brother Randon when he would talk about brother Veil remember in Christ the mystery and here they were in the blue barar now all of a sudden you know something opens up about the tax case again and brother Veil you know pipes up at that moment and he and he says my goodness he says brother R when people were talking about him he said how in the world can you let people talk to you like that and brother BR says brother veale he said a very smart and intellectual man he said I think he's been dealing with these intellectual people so long he just knows how to lay the word in there till they don't know where to stand he said but he's a little too quick on the trigger I and you know brother Bale he said my I said that takes an awful lot of Grace to think like that and brother Brown would tell him he said but he goes in to how remember the crippled man when David was walking out of the Kingdom being exiled and that crippled man spit on David and brother Bram would say it in that manner he said notice how David said let him alone remember somebody said shall I take his head off and David said let him alone the Lord told him to do that that was a test for David David was tested all along that was a test for David brother r said the Lord has told them to do that oh my I I I just I believe this is what I believe I believe the caliber and the quality of the Holy Ghost that was manifest in a Son of God the prophet of God in this age I believe that same thing about my Holy Ghost I believe that this is one who has come to maturity one who showed demonstrated manifest before us of what a real Son of God is oh my you know you want to be like the one remember who had asked uh remember he had a debt in Matthew 18 he had a debt he owed he owed he owed a lot of money a lot of tal talents I think it was 10,000 and his lord said pay up and what did he say have patience with me suffer long with me and the Lord was moved with compassion and He restored to him everything that he had sold from him family house so forth and he said I will repay thee but that same man turned around he had a servant that owed him a couple talents it wasn't like what he owed the Lord he owed the Lord 10,000 his his servant his servant owed him too or five and he grabbed the guy by the neck pay me what you owe me and they got around back to the Lord wait a minute this man asked for patience from you I gave you patience suffered long with you but now you want this the man was thrown into the prison right until he repented of that sometimes torment is a rod of Correction are you with me see the mercy of God will not allow one of his children to get by with misbehavior he won't allow that to happen brother Bram takes us into that real deep in the in the Hebrew Series in many places over and over how God will not lose one even if one of his will not come to correction brother Ben told us he said God will take him on home if he won't be corrected notice let me get this last part here 1 Corinthians 13:4 it suffereth long and is kind my so to suffer long this charity suffereth long we're talking about an inward work we're talking about an in power that manifests itself not slow to wrong but is also kind that's a simple word is't it it's like one of those words that you're taught when you're real little it's a word that we taught in Sunday school it's a word that we taught preschool and God is still teaching us amen notice in Proverbs 31 notice what it speaks concerning this type of the Bride she is strength and honor are her cloth and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness no man can Bridle the tongue but God can God can and I can tell you if you've got a if you've got a bad where it just seems like you're you're ready to spout and ready to say but Sam what's the remedy well if you're not born again get born again but but if but if you are that's been settled in your heart then just remember keep it covered with the blood of Jesus stay in his presence and say Lord strengthen me Lord help me Lord Jesus you see it's speaking the truth and love we would find that through the scripture because because you know it's out of the heart that the mouth would speak this is what Jesus said bless them that curse you pray for them that despitefully use you I think that's a nobody likes feeling used nobody does nobody like even somebody who is the most generous person in the world you can tell pray for them who would despitefully use you think of this in first 1 Peter chapter 3: 8 finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one of another that means it's reciprocated back and forth love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous this means be kind not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing Oh my he would have to write this to Believers yes because also remember not all there are believers and sometimes even a believer can get into the wrong influence not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but Contra blessing so instead of evil for evil do the opposite bless knowing that ye are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days anybody love life oh brother Samuel I hate life you need prayer you need prayer oh brother Samuel I just want the Rapture to come I hate this life you need prayer because you're to enjoy this life I'm not talking about the things of the world but I'm talking about this life your husband your wife your children your grandchildren you're not to wish away this life that is not what the coming of the Lord is all about it's to live and to enjoy Paul would write to enjoy in the book of Timothy to enjoy those things that God has given to us to enjoy life to have joy we ought to have joy in this life not just well Lord I have joy when you transform my body you're missing something you're to have joy right now this Joy leads into that Joy it's this joy that makes us look with a real expectation and and a real Earnest in our life it's that joy that gets a hold of somebody's attention and says my goodness what is it that's about your life doesn't mean that you're skipping down the street the joy of the Lord is our strength meaning that you know where you stand you know what he has done in your life and this is real Joy you might be in the midst of chaos you might be in the midst of the hardest trial but yet you've got joy you can conduct yourself with joy why because as a Son of God and a daughter of God you know who you are it isn't that you know the outcome of the trial it isn't that you know how things are going to come out that's not faith faith is my life is in his hands I trust him completely for he that will love life and see good days oh my let him refrain his Young from Evil and his lips that they speak no gu anybody love life you want to see good days and don't speak evil let our lives be so full of God to what we're speaking about is him and no matter the conversations of the day it always comes back to him to him what he's showing us what he's speaking to us what he's doing let him notice this es skew evil that means to go out of the way go out of the way of evil to turn oneself away from it let him escue evil and do good and let him seek peace and ensue it brother would say it just like this he would speak in this is your life worthy of the Gospel talking about us being in love to in love with your enemy somebody would call you Holy Roller and he said be careful be careful but when you really find yourself in love with them regardless of what they do you still love them then you begin to find and your patience gets from about that long till they just don't have no end how many say Lord give me more patience right now give me more patience then what what is it that brings Patience Test trials offenses this is letting patience have her perfect work so notice patience will grow it starts out as brother Bram would illustrate it maybe I can just jump in it starts out about this long but thank God it's that long and then it'll grow to this long long then to this long and then to this long what is it it's growing it's a fruit of the spirit that is growing in your life notice it'll just to ain't no end and anybody just keeps saying things about you well I don't care what they say don't get stirred up look at this if you get stirred up you better go pray first well how would I know if I'm going to get stirred up check your spirit and how you think about approaching them right now when the way you feel right now if you feel all anxious and all tensed up right now go pray first go pray first because all it's going to take is somebody to let a spark off and it's this is wisdom here slow to wrath what should I do if I'm feeling that go pray first for you talk to them again don't get into fusses let me just move on here there's a lot but let me just move on this is where even the Lord Jesus when he would speak in Luke chapter 6 once again just like what in Matthew love your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil now you might as well be honest when you've done what you've done and somebody says I don't like this this is what we're having this is all we've got this is what it is be kind to the unthankful we're living in an age right now Paul talked about these Peerless times where men would be unth thanful unthankful where it's just like everything thing is given to us well this is just how it ought to be it's unthankful it's a spirit that has moved even upon the world brother Bram even warns to the Believers of how the coldness of the spirit he said this Spirit many have not recognized it in these last days is that coldness of the love of God coldness moving in be he is kind unto those unthankful and to the evil my my my be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful brother would say it like this even though you may be an unbeliever or skeptic that don't keep me from loving you I do it anyhow CA it's not me that does the loving now let me just inject something here this love that he's getting read that he's talking about is not something that walks around and just puts its hands and says I love you if it's not down here you're a hypocrite hello do you going to have people that want to draw you out well if you really have the love of God this is what you'll do because many people only know a sensual fleshly emotional intellectual level they don't know the real love of God but notice I do it anyhow cuz it's not me that does the loving it's the Lord Jesus in my heart that makes me love you and me as a man I wouldn't do it I'd want to know why when and how why should I love him when and how as a man but he in me makes me something that overrides and moves Us in those times you know how it is when people would say you're going to let the boss talk to you that way you're going to let so and so I mean you know how it is it it goes from the middle school classroom or cafeteria it travels into the locker room then you find it in the workplace instigators hello somebody instigators what is that demonic anointing trying to instigate stir something up notice he says but Christ in my heart says this is me I died for that person no matter what you do I still love you anyhow not from my lips from my heart and every Christian does the same thing as long as Jesus abides in the heart now let me just let me just try to just wrap this part up here there really no way to do it but let me find this point right here to try to close on brother brandham had been in a meeting and uh spirit of God was moving discernment was taking place how that the Lord would come in the service as you know and do what needed to what he would come and perform his word there was a man who was there who was the a Lutheran who was the dean of a college and being the dean of a college what he said at that time what did he say he he wrote a letter to brother Bram and said I drove all this way to come and hear a soothsayer and he began to criticize brother brandham horrible in the letter I want you to think of this the impact of suffering long let me just paraphrase some of these points I didn't include it to be displayed I just want to read over it and he called him a polished up soothsayer and he be to refer I've been preaching before you were ever nursing so brother Braham said I I wrote him a letter back he said he called me brandom he wouldn't even call me brother in that letter but brother Bram said I still had respect for him I said dear precious brother no one could preach the gospel 50 years and yet disrespect Christ I wouldn't think so you see he's a man brother talking about that man he's a man he's not made out of sawdust he's a human being and I wrote him a nice letter back he had told me the very idea of you standing up there I drove 15 miles through a blinding snowstorm to hear a man of God and what that I find but a polished up soothsayer now let me just pause right there right there we could say as brother Brown would go on to quote Jesus said if you speak one word against the son of man it'll be forgiven but to speak one word against the Holy Ghost it'll never be forgiven you in this life or in the life to come now wonder brother bam writing this and he refers to that scripture but notice the long suffering that is mixed within it I forgive you for that brother he writes about what people has they seen Jesus Christ doing the same thing as he did in his day and I said you know what good has your 50 years done but he said in the letter but I know you didn't mean that from your heart this what brother Bram said to the man I know you didn't mean that from your heart I just don't think that a man could talk about Jesus for 50 years and preach for him and being a dean of a college could talk about Jesus like that you're just excited and don't understand it what's brother Bram doing love is making excuses I hope you understand me sometimes you know how it is a parent can make excuses for their for their kids this is not what we're talking about here wrong has been done sometimes parents can make excuses for their kids and you got to keep making them the rest of their life are you with me they keep coming back to you Lord mommy daddy make an excuse for me it's so and so's fault and it's this and it's oh you're right honey it's their fault they should have never you know you're just an Angel that's that's the kind of excuses we're talking about those are lies those aren't excuses you're lying to them they'll have problems in their marriage if they get married they'll have problems all through their life you know why you've painted him up to be an angel and you've made him a devil maybe we should stop long ago here notice you're just excited and just don't understand it see he's given it the benefit of the doubt this is what love does later he wrote me a letter and he said I apologize for that I hear you're coming to Minneapolis now he invited brother brandham to come to the college he said brother Bram we want to have dinner with you and I want you to come he kept saying brother Aon brother Ram kept repeating in this message he even stood up at that banquet he had dinner and he talked about he made known what he had said and he said I'm so sorry that I said that and he spoke to brother Bram he said brother Bram he said help us to see it he said we want to see a move of God here help us we want to see the Holy Ghost teach us brother BR you see his teaching is the reason he was saying what he was saying brother randam stood there in that time and just begin to talk to him you know brother Ram will tell this story in many different other places they were a college where they had to grow their own food their crops and brother Bram takes them in the process of that stock of corn growing up into that place of maturity brother R deals with it have then how the Holy Ghost would come Faith he said faith is a wonderful thing you need Faith you must have faith he that cometh to God must must first believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him it must be by faith you are justified by faith but God must come and honor that faith and right there at that banquet table you've heard brother bam tell it 400 students and the dean said we want to receive it brother random right now what do we do he said get out of your chairs turn around get on your knees he said and put your back to the table and start to pray brother br we walked around that room and we laid hands on over 400 he said every one of them got the baptism of the Holy Ghost now this is what I want to ask you what if brother brandom would not have suffered long those students would have never got what they needed that man would have never got what he needed but suffering long slow to avenge the wrong what did it do it gave an opportunity that that man beneath as brother bam says you were just excited you didn't understand I pray God help me help us I would rather be able I would rather you know this is scripture on down in through this 1 Corinthians 13 on Love It is there for us to be able to make excuse I don't understand why brother did there are places in the scripture where correction indeed has to come in the church there are things that has to be repented of but there's got to to be the heart that is there that's willing to receive that life or that heart or when the person would come to make the wrong right it has to be there so all of this as brother brandham I think of it if he if he had stood in that manner my what would have happened we' have never read about this that man might have been cut off see this is why brother Brian would tell us your attitude toward that person could affect their Eternal destination so God help me Brother Sam you need the Lord to help you every day every day every day of my life every day I need his help I told you last week I told you before when I how many times have ministered on things and in with these parts right here but I'll tell you it's not a time that I don't read over it and I don't go through it even in studying that I find myself saying Lord help me help me Lord Jesus oh it isn't that we're constantly failing it isn't that but it's seeing our need of more of him I want more of him I want to live more in that presence this is my access this is the control is when he's got more control of me more control of a situation let him have more control over you let's pray Heavenly Father dear God we love you tonight Lord we just appreciate you thank you for your mercy thank you Lord for speaking to our hearts such a simple way that Lord I pray that you would help us tonight Lord as you've spoke to us you have not you've not left us on our own but you have allowed us to see that God this indeed it is possible I know that Lord not only for myself but speaking across to my brothers and sisters here we've witnessed this Lord we witnessed the love of God the charity that of God in our life moving in these times Lord I pray that you would just continue to teach us Lord help us father Lord we even in times that we live in now sometimes Lord when situations and things arise and they come Lord there there's nothing that Lord that you would let us know well this is coming or or this offense is going to come or this is going to come because even if you did even if you did we need you help us Lord Jesus help us Lord that we might be so hidden in you help us dear God to keep these areas of our life covered with the blood of Jesus Christ Christ help us Lord I pray dear God to bear this fruit Lord Lord Jesus it'll take more than just reading the word it'll take more than just listening to tapes it'll take more than just setting under good preaching it takes time alone with you as your Prophet would tell us he said you can do a lot of things too much and Lord how we thank you for good preaching thank you Lord God for the message that we have access to it Lord God right here on our phones Lord I so thankful for that thank you Lord God that we have the Bible in our hands Lord God to be able to read it men that gave their lives like John hust and William tendale that it could be put in the hands of common men how I thank you Lord God for that burden Lord Jesus how that we must be in prayer Paul would write in the armor of the believer pray without ceasing we would be admonished to stay in prayer to pray Lord God even for our leaders to pray dear God father Lord for those who would despitefully use us to pray Lord God for one another Lord Lord Jesus help us help us Lord God we can see that's the victory that's the key right there Lord is that we're able Lord God to really get Before the Throne of God no wonder Jude Lord I know it seems like Lord I've quoted that scripture out on over and over in past months but no under Jude would write under Inspirations keeping yourselves in the love of God help us Lord help us Lord dear God behind my hands My Heart is Open Lord help me Lord Jesus help me dear God help me Lord I pray help us Lord to exhibit that kindness to manifest that Lord God I believe Lord God we know it's a witness Lord we see dear God how that
