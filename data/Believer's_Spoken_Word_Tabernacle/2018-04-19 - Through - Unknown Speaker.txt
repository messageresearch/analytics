certainly appreciated of your prayers and continual prayers for the family for this time when the passing of sister Gomez's mother and we just had just a wonderful service there this morning and then there at the at the graveside but we want to continue to remember them in prayer and just that the Lord will just continue to strengthen them in the midst of this time the Lord is so good in me it's so good so good let's look at Isaiah 43 and I'm just going to read a few verses of Scripture here in verse 1 is where we'll start but now thus saith the Lord that created the Oh Jacob and he that formed thee O Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou pass it through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walk us through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee let's let's continue reading here just for a few moments for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Savior I gave a for thy ransom Ethiopia and say before thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the Deaf that have years let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth ye are my witnesses saith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the lord and beside me there is no Savior I have declared have saved and I have showed when there was no strange God among you therefore are ye are my witnesses saith the Lord that I am God it's so precious isn't it word of God this is this is personal it's just personal i I feel like it was wonderful that the Lord would just as what he spoke to us there in the first few verses but then he goes in and just continues to break and make known to you and I over and over though what he already has done and now as we stand as his witnesses for his glory amen let's just bow our heads and order prayer for we're seated our Heavenly Father as we just turn our hearts and our attention for the the next few moment Lord God into your word and we just thank you for the time of worship Lord here tonight Lord that we have we've had in your presence Lord and as we we move on in Lord to worship now or God around your word for it is truly your word that has drawn us to you Lord and we are not people who worship in word only but we worship Lord in spirit and in truth Lord and we would ask the Lord that your precious Holy Spirit Lord you who are the word that you would come Lord and speak to our hearts and a very personal way to night Lord encourage us Lord you know where each and every one is Lord and you are able Lord only you to reach Lord to every heart and every life we want to say thank you Lord for your word tonight Lord and may your presence just in a real sweet way just come among us Lord and speak to our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless use your being seated I just have one word that I want to just speak tonight and that's the word through through not not throw like a baseball but through like through something that we read here in the scriptures you see and many times you know we can we can talk about different things but unless you've been through something you really are only talking about it as a spectator and we know in order to be through something you weren't just you're not when we think of it in terms of the Lord you're not it's not that you're a survivor you're an overcomer so in order to through something there is a there is a part there's a place where it starts and and that state place there here where we come through to an end and you know how it is it's always it's always a comfort when different ones that maybe with things that you're facing or you're going through and you're able to talk with someone that can encourage you that God is faithful you know it's one thing we all can get together and I tell you the worst thing that could be is if if I'm down I want somebody that can come and encourage me I don't want someone who will pull me down and say oh yeah brother Samuel I tell you what I am going through the biggest time of my life I need somebody's gonna encourage me I need someone who's gonna point me and say you know what I may not have been through that exact thing but I can tell you God has brought me through my test and my trials and that right there I can look and say and at that individual that person and to know what they're saying they weren't making light of the trial or the test that I'm in but what it is is that they are testifying of God's faithfulness to see us through and I believe that that's why as a body of believers I believe that that is the working of God within our lives I don't believe friends that it's just reserved to myself as a pastor to be an encourage or of the people although I do encourage but I believe that every one of us in here are to be an encouragement and an edification one to another I believe that I believe that by the working of the Lord within our life your testimony in my testimony it might be somewhat different but there's one thing that's in common with it and that's the Lord Jesus Christ the things that may be that God has brought you through it may be different from me you know sometimes you can take different ones that's been through things medically and then others that may be through things that's been financially and all of these different aspects but in all God has people that he can put his hand upon that no matter what it is that they are facing and going through that it can always be a testimony that they are standing faithful it'd be one thing if if when we stand there and hear the enemy would have some bragging grounds to say well they all have come through when it comes to things medically in their life and you've brought them through and you've healed them each time I mean each time they've not even had to go to a doctor they've never even had to go under a surgeon's knife each and every time and and you know we could we could look at that but yet God has such testimonies that in sometimes just even in our own individual life where God has come on the scene and touched us and then there's been other times where we had to go to a doctor or a surgeon but yet within it all we understand that that in itself our faith is in God our faith is not in the process it's in God to take us through and so within that that encouragement that is given to us and one another I I look here in the scripture my heart is just zeroed in on this here when I look in verse 2 and when I you see it it doesn't say if that you pass through waters you didn't say if you go through rivers if you walk through the fire but all of this is says win so it's not if that's going to be it trials are not inevitable trials trials are gonna be there God's letting them know even beforehand that I'm with you you're gonna come through waters when you do they will not overflow you when you come into rivers they're not gonna drowns you when you come into a fire it's not the fire itself you're not gonna be burned so God is letting us know then he's lettuce lettuce Ron let us know that these are times in your life that you will come through but I want you to know that I'm there with you I want you to know that I'm not off from a distance and watching but I want you to know that I am with you how that God would make that so clear in the scripture I will be with you what a time you know think of this that as we've looked at it over the course of time with the Hebrew children they didn't have an answer from God that he was going to be with them in the fire but where they made their stand was on the word God allowed that whole thing to come God allowed as we looked at it some weeks ago God allowed that silence to be there but you see even in the silence their faith was in the Living God and they stood upon his word and he was after they went through that that God made himself known so it's it's things that when we come down to it that whether we feel him whether we're getting answers right then or not we have this where we can stand on it say Lord regardless if I feel you or not I love to feel you but this is your word this is what you said that you would be with me and I believe that you are with me it's a comfort from the word and when you we look at this you know how that through the midst of it you know I look at how when this when the scripture that we read it says when you pass through the waters II it's not going to be over them but it you're gonna go through the waters you're not gonna be lifted above but you have to go through it but God lets us know through it I'm gonna be right there with you and they made they even makes this statement win that walkest through the fire when thou walkest you know when you walk you know when you're walking somewhere if you're running you can look at somebody running and you could say my they're in a hurry but walking your walk and when your person is walking they're at rest they're moving along and they're at rest it it even speaks of that within our life where God would call us through there's a lot of things that we would like to run through we'd like to run through it but God lets us know when thou walkest if God has permitted a test or trial to come our way then this is where our faith stands resolute that God has permitted sufficient grace to see us through that trial and whether whatever we we cannot going to be able to see it in the midst of it and we may not see it to way after but yet in all God Himself is bringing his purpose forth out of our life and I look here when I just just looking over these things this quote that stood out to me for some months and just pouring I think I've probably listened to this message time-tested memorials of God I don't know how many times in the past months and I just just keep cleaning and gleaning and gleaning from it but there was a phrase in here that I want to just just looking at it's just so resonated my heart brother hem says Jesus Christ came from heaven to glory came from heaven to glory from glory down here they're here to build a church and the material that he's putting in it is time-tested material he said you might come to the altar and make a confession but when he finds blowholes and everything else in to where the world's blown the maggots in you and so forth you cannot stand he just pitches you to one side you know the Bible says that whosoever cometh to God must be chastened and tried is that right there's got to be there's always the testing and try and it's after the trial that God brings the ceiling it's after the trial is over even at every trial that carries on after that it's after that trial where God will make himself known and it's where God is releasing of himself and the real releasing of himself is the real releasing of who the real you and I are see God is not an author of confusion as a great master sculptor when we come into these sacred sands we come into the hot desert sands when we come into these places that God will bring us into areas for our molding and for our perfecting brother brems says God wants a time-tested church not some money's a Christian today and a backslider tomorrow and is in and out up and down he can't place you nowhere but he's got a church that's tested went through the trials through losses through sickness through sorrow through death still standing with the testimony that's the man all of this is gone through so not just someone who came up to it and said no way I mean imagine imagine that within your marriage because serving the Lord look this is not science that's something separate it eat God would even bring that example down to you and I to imagine a link of the vows of what the vows that are made for better for worse in sickness and in health all of these things and yet when there's things that after the marriage itself has has commences then that's when everybody if we can say like this starts to let their hair down that's when you see you really really really get to see not just some faults or little things that you saw but you really begin to see all of that and that's where there has to be a real solidness of real revelation and ink or something that's there to hold you is that true because there there's going to be all sorts of things of disappointments and everything but yet it's through all of that you know just like when they they they always have at the end of those stories we were growing up and they lived happily ever after in an amazing that that phrase is right after their ceremony they lived happily ever after wait a minute here what about all the tests and trial what about all the letting down and all what about all that but you see through through it all it's through those things as we look at it in our walk with the Lord it's through these things where God proves his love and His faithfulness to you and I in even a much deeper way yes brother brems said that's the man he's looking for he says I don't care if you're a pauper I don't care if you're a beggar I don't care if you're a rack dick or whatever you are God puts the test to you he's looking for time-tested material brother Brent makes the statement and that same message of time test of material and he deals with character and he makes a statement he says your your knowing your character is known in life by your works you know it's just like if you're gonna hire someone on to do a job you want to know what kind of job they do is that right I mean if if they're doing a job you know and you know it's just like our brother Richie who does the siding if they went and looked at his houses that he did in siding and all these thing was these rippling and buckling and seeing all these nails coming out and what you think he'd have much business no no because what it is what his name is not Road on the side of that house but yet it is Road on the side of that house when they get to looking at things and many of the times than annuities were brother Richie it's just it's a word-of-mouth thing that where it goes where he has referrals from this contractor referring to this contractor you know I even know how it is when we've have a little thing with in the neighborhood and they're you know wanting to know how can we get to paint and who can we get this and I'll see these little blurbs come up there on my email and they're referring somebody and you know what you start finding a number of people within the neighborhood they own the app they started referring this one person you're like wow this person is referred like eight out of ten times their name keeps coming up and what is written about them now you know that that's just not family members some person the one day actually asked and said how are they related to you and and the person respond they said they're not you know and you had different ones throughout so their work is what is what what testifies of them and that's the same way it is within our life for them says it don't matter how much you testify it don't matter what all you said all those things that you can do your works your life itself speaks out I want to just look here in a place this is a just so gripped my heart as we look at these things with Paul and I've just pondered over these scriptures now for a few months and just looking at it and you know as we see Paul comes the second Corinthians chapter 12 and in verse 11 he says I'm become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for I ought to been commended of you for in nothing I am behind of the very chiefest apostles though I'd be nothing now what Paul is referring to is where you had those other ministers and Paul would refer to him as false brother and in different ones who were coming around and they were you know kind of building themselves up among the people and things like that and Paul he begins to speak of this and that's what he's talking about from the previous chapters which I want to go in just a moment but I want you to watch this what he says here in verse 12 this is just so struck my heart truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patients in signs wonders and mighty deeds so the signs of an apostle wants you to think look how where Paul is led to include he doesn't start out saying signs wonders mighty deeds but the very first thing is that is the testimony is in all patience that is in all endurance that is a true sign because you see in many of the things within Paul's life there were many times that there were who was we seen cities that were against him people that were against him all of these things that were there and you know what no matter what signs and what deeds could have been in Paul's life if Paul himself would've ran away and forsake it then you know what it would not have been an effectiveness but what they could see is there's something greater than this man's spirit this is just not Paul talking about something preaching about something but this man you standing with the solidness even in the midst of what he's going through remember when plow and read it last week when Paul himself was stoned right outside of of Antioch I believe it was here he was they left him for dead but Paul rose up and he went right back into the city he didn't leave that place and go somewhere else he went right back into the city and then the next day he departed for Lystra why because there are believers that were there in Antioch and they need to see not just hear a word they need to see a faithful word displayed amen that's the testimony friends listen that's a testimony even in this age you see it's not just a message that comes forth I want to just look at this just for a moment I'm not going to dwell on this but it's a great big wonderful subject when brother Branham makes a statement that the message and the messenger of one he lays that all the way down and what he's dealing with within that is that brother Branham himself cannot be speaking something different from the experience of the word in his own life and neither should you and I speak something different from the experience in her own life because it is through that experience it is true that life that's expressed you know how it is on your job in other places there is things where you may not even be able to say anything to anybody but your life that's live will grant access because that is the greatest greatest witness as here the Lord said ye are my witnesses you know God had witnesses who looked at that the witnesses of the Hebrew children he had witnesses down there of Daniel remember the King didn't want to throw Daniel in there he even came in Daniel Daniel has that God spared thee right but it was a witness that right there God allowed that situation allowed that with the Hebrew children it was working out in their life but at the same time there was those things that of that testified and they were witnesses unto the Lord my so many things that they're working out in our life notice how Paul Paul goes into this in 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 16 and in this is where Paul from the previous chapter here where we read he said I say it again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a full received me then I may boast myself a little that which I speak I speak it not after the Lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting seeing that many glory after the flesh I will glory also for you suffer fools gladly seeing you yourselves are wise for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalts you if a man smite you on the face I speak as concerning reproach as though we have been weak howbeit we're in so ever in his bold I speak foolishly I am bold also so Paul he's already declaring how I'm speaking it's foolishly because why Paul is bringing into account even everything within his life they already know this but you see Paul look what Paul is bringing out here Paul's not saying remember now that there were special miracles that were wrought from my mind their hands he's not testifying of those things in here he could testify because there were many mighty signs and wonders and you know as you read in the book of Acts that there were many places that Paul could not get entrance even in that one who was a governor he could not get entrance there was one who was preventing Paul from getting to that governor there but God moved on the scene and a mighty miracle it moved on the scene to turn that man's heart to open to hear the gospel but yet Paul is talking to believers here now he's late he's talking to them of a real proof and he's bringing them to this understanding he says are they Hebrews so am i are they Israelites Soma are they the seed of Abraham so am i are they ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more in Labour's more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths often of the Jews five times I received forty stripes save one Thrax was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of water in perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren he's not he's not writing about the signs and wonders he's writing about God's keeping power and testimony through the hardness and darkest of times that God has seen him through why that's a true sign of a believer that is a true sign of a believer the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe absolutely and this is also a truce hi it's the first one that Paul wrote about he could have said you've seen me in deeds and wonders but he laid it down first you have witnessed an apostle among you in all patience in weariness look at this in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches so Paul's not just dealing with that everything is it guns are targeted right on his life but Paul says also the burning of the churches are resting on me this burden this care too to carry on what was it that allowed Paul to go through all of this and stand and testify it was the purpose of God that it laid such a hole in his life that Paul knew who he was he knew where he belonged and he was standing there it gave him grace to face the weariness to face everything that came along in peril here and peril there and peril there it gave him grace who is weak and I am NOT weak who is offended and I burn not if I must needs glory I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities Nepal was not testifying brother Branham lays us out in a real way in the message because there was somebody going around and saying that were Paul glory din his infirmities so they had people getting up and giving a testimony praise God i've got rheumatoid arthritis thank God you know that I'm suffering brother Brent says he said the poor individual I don't know who told him that he said but that's not what Paul was talking about glory in my infirmities there was a condition within Paul's eyes we know that would come and it would go is that right it would come it would go and you know Paul he prayed three times Lord take this from me but you know what God let him know he is very familiar scripture to all of us maybe you have it on a plaque at home but he said when God spoke to him he said Paul my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness at that moment Paul himself said then I will glory in my infirmities you know what it was Paul began to realize I don't need to focus on this I know that God has permit and look Paul realized why God permitted it he was able to write it what God permitted it that this would come upon him less Paul himself should get lifted above his brethren trials tests and things have a way of humbling us they have a way of reminding us of the frailty of our humanity and that's all in everything of bringing out of our life it's also God keeping you and I in a place to where he can move and work and deal with our lives the way that he desires to let me read on as Paul says in 2nd Corinthians 6 a few chapters before that in verse 3 he says giving no offence and anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in necessities in de-stresses surely Paul got this wrong sure maybe I've got the wrong translation here it must be the wrong translation because to prove ourselves as a ministers of God it must first be miracles signs wonders and we thank God for all of that surely it must be we approve ourselves as ministers of God were able to preach the word that's not what Paul's talking about notice the first thing that he mentions be approving this word approving is the word deal commence which means a coin if it says on that coin like the coins that we have if it says that amount that's truly how much it's worth in those days they would have a coin and it had or had a weight it had something stamped upon it but the men that were doing the coin collecting would shave down that point and that coin would say something on the outside but it didn't have to match on the inside what was on the outside and Paul said approving our selves as ministers of God how Paul in much patience in afflictions in necessities in de-stresses in stripes in imprisonments intimates in Labor's in watchings in fastings who can say hey and about their thing do you want to be a minister anybody out there but you know what just as it is for the ministers of God for the word and the message that comes for the messenger of the age there's trials that go along to bring forth what is there that God is purpose with under the ministry of the under shepherds that are under the hear God has the trials that are so set and for each and every one of your lives God has the trials that are set because it's all working for one purpose one purpose not multiple purpose one purpose that Christ himself might be glorified and displayed in our lives you see there's places that your light and the glow of God the witness like we read in Isaiah it'll shine in places that somebody else is not there and you might look and say hey I'm working here why man this department or why I'm here you are the light of the world glory of God has risen upon thee and the light is shining is shining out in this age until you talk about in this age friends where people have become so Gospel hardening and then please forgive me and bear with me when I say this there's some things I can't blame them for become hardened remember what brother Brent said he said I'm glad God got ahold of me before the religions did he said because I might have been an infidel McRaven for reality they can see somebody that no matter what's going on it's easy to be a Christian when things are going out but here in the midst of this of proving yourselves in patience and afflictions and de-stresses in all of these things that in itself shows there's got to be something deeper that's holding this individual it's got to be something deeper and then and then let's hear what you have to say Paul goes on to say here two verses later by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned it's not that Paul did not you know believe in the Holy Ghost but this first part here in much patience and afflictions and necessities in distress although this wasn't a reality where the Holy Ghost had quickened that seed it was God that he met face to face it's God who held him and even as Paul said when I came along you I came not with enticing words of man's wisdom that your faith would stand in those words but I want your faith to stand in the power of God oh my we could go on but let me let me move forward here brother venom you know he tells us in three kinds of believers and talks about job and he says concerning job he said you know job was tried and said I know my Redeemer liveth at the last day so stand up on the earth though after my skin worms destroy smite after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God you cannot annihilate it though the skin worms eat it up it still will come back again whom I shall see for myself mine eyes shall behold and not another he said job why he was a believer in trials he was a believer in persecution he was a believer he was a genuine believer did joke complain yes but he was still a genuine believer did job say all the day had been when they had not said a man child was born I wish I'd have never been born sure you know you know that when you read the book of Job but God is faithful to see us through there's not one of us sitting here where there's been trials that's come that we would say oh no and it's not like we weren't we run to every trial ho ho come come but he is faithful to see us through Paul goes on I love reading Paul Paul goes on in second Timothy 3 verse 10 but thou has fully known writing here to Timothy my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and Iconium and Lystra I want to ask you this question God you Godhead wrote in his Bible what he wanted wrote is that right Paul who seen him after his resurrection veiled in the pillar of fire and Paul would find it necessary to write these things to Timothy that this would be made known to the Church of the Living God why why did God take up space in the Bible with this why did God take up space to talk about the persecutions to talk about the afflictions to talk about and call them back to remember Antioch Lystra and Iconium why because God also did that through the Old Testament you know it would be one thing if I want you to think of this you and I reading the scriptures we we we have that anchor within us God is faithful but to think how God has so laid it out in his word for you and I through where the Bible could say in I believe it's in the book of Romans Romans 15 through comfort of the Scriptures might have hope there Joel himself there wasn't even a written Bible is that well how did you have well we have he knew the Bible that God had written in the stars it was quickened to joke to be able to read that and to read it also in nature Paul told us in the book of Romans that nature itself declares the Godhead here it is all around the reading the Bible the reading God gave aware that when ministered to them and encouraged them in that time to think about in this hour that you and I are living in where brother Adam tells us in the opening of souls in prison now he said I used to wonder why it was that Abraham and Sarah after that event happening there in Genesis 18 how could they go down there tell that lie and go into those things how could they do it he said but I begin to recognize that if it was not for those things we would not know the grace of God we know God's saving grace but let me tell you his grace is not just saving grace it is keeping grace what didn't have to include those things in there God could have had this the Bible wrote in such a way to where you and I could say oh I can never I can never mount up to that I could never God didn't have it wrote that way God included the weaknesses he allowed that let me tell you something God could have omitted that he goes like nope too much taking up too much space but God's not interested in glorying our flesh he is glorified through the weakness of our flesh Paul said persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium and Lystra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me was testifying hello and yeah all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution oh cool rabito god you know brother banner makes a statement and perfect strength of pearly weakness this quote has blessed my soul over the years you know it's just something how the Holy Spirit will bring things back to your mind and brother brems says when we stand there that day he said we will stand beside some of the weakest and outcast people of the world weakest not strengthened they're all why would that be necessary to show that it's not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord hallelujah God testifies we are his witnesses of what he has said bill Vanneman message jubilee here he says if a man is ever born of the Spirit of God not make-belief but really filled with God's Spirit he sealed him in there till the day of his Redemption he will be christ-like today he'll be christ-like tomorrow he'll be christ-like the next day in the trials he's christ-like it trebles he's christ-like in hunger he's christ-like in joy he's christ-like everywhere you see him or her they're christ-like for you're sealed by the Holy Ghost see what I mean that's not your spirit who I was a head time that's not your spirit your spirit gets down my spirit gets down my flesh your flesh feels it come on somebody when the Prophet was up there working on that telephone pole and it was weary of what had taken place he took the glove off and went to reach over is that right he wanted out of that the pressure mounting God didn't have to include that in the message but God included that for you and I why because there's more mortals more just like you and I those things don't make me think less they make me think more I thank God that God included those I thank God that God and showed the humanity of the Prophet he's done it all the way through that encourages me hallelujah think about this in these christ-like nuts your spirit that's not your spirit house spirit I'll get weary I'll spit here you are you complaining I don't know why why and all of a sudden here raises up within you say lord help me Jesus Lord strengthen me Lord forgive me Lord for complaining Lord take that Lord I don't don't let anything set in my heart Lord take it away Lord what I just love you to you you find yourself in the midst of you say that sounds like a war that's going on it is it is it is brother member says when you've been born again there now is a constant war [Applause] amen praise the Lord thank God little Samuel constant war because you know I'm not what I used to be I'm in resistance against that shall we see our weaknesses sure we see the time sure you and you and I both we've come into situations I'm done and you can see some money down down you can talk to him on the phone or here and there down you know what there's not anything I don't look at somebody when they're down and say how can they be down I've been down as well but I have confidence in the Living God that lives on the inside of them lives on the inside of me that that God will also lift them up because why the Bible is very clear he restoreth my soul nay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death if it's a shadow that's gotta be light present and if light is present light is there to guide me through all the way yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow death I will fear no evil for thou art with me hallelujah I'm talking about comfort tonight through through Jesus said it like this when he was asking them who do you say I am who do men say that I am Peter here that that seed rises up and says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against him when he made that statement he already was declaring the gates of Hell are going to be against it and let me tell you something the gates of hell is every one of them powers Satan's Trinity the demonic powers religious powers and political powers that Trinity devil works all around has it moves it trying to bring pressure the gates of Hell shall not prevail they might come against you you know what gates are you know what they do a gates don't you think of in the Old Testament gates are where transactions take place is that right when Boaz what did he have to do go to the gate of the elder right when they ascended up on high he led captivity candidate open up you gates Lord Jesus how long you're going on that tonight gates of hell shall not prevail when they come against you in there try to get you and try to bring your side of disease or whatever it might be but yet God is a understand right there and with his precious blood God's got anointed ministry God's got brothers and his brothers and sisters he's got different ones and with him prayer the prayer of faith there is a transaction that is made at the gate and the devil is stripped of that power and that authority because he's already defeated the gates of Hell shall not prevail hallelujah glory be to God sin against you just like real RAM tells us he said in present stage of my ministry he said there were prophets that rose up and prophesied concerning this work he said and they bros up in prophesied concerning Branham Tabernacle they said it will be a garage in six months time brother Branham said they look at it today he said his own fire for God he said you know what it is the gates of Hell come against it but they could not take it you know why because he knew the prophets could prophesy and say look this is going to be a failure in six months and this is going to happen to one more but you know what to one who knows where he's standing he don't matter all the chatter that goes on you know where you're standing and you're garnering your strength from the Lord for a beat of God upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not be able to prevail hallelujah this is where God and let it be known in his word familiar place of Scripture first Corinthians Paul admonishes us he's lets us know that that temptation that trial that God has allowed to come our way he's gonna make him make a way of escape that we might be able to bear it bro Graham said when I heard the pastor say this morning in a second handed robe many are becoming discouraged what we need brother is to take courage what we need is to be encouraged trials may come we never was promised to be immune from them but he will give grace to go through them if the mountains too hot to go over too deep to go under now you know sometimes but the dud you're gonna have to go over the mountain if it's too high Lord I don't know if I can make it over that mountain God said come on we're gonna climb it we're gonna ascend this mountain then some months you look at it Lord it's just way too high and that's what he wants you to say and you would say it's too hot and he says look there's a way around it the Lord I'm trying to get from here to here but doesn't I need to take you around this way because there are experiences around this way that are tailored for you so if it's too high or it's too wide where is too high to go over there's too wide to go around oh he will give you grace to go through it go through it but brother Brown was talking about the black minister see don't you believe that boy I sure do he said I haven't believe what's wrote on the cover Holy Bible the man said Jones what if God told Judah goes junk through that brick wall would you do it he said sure would he said Jones how in the world there ain't no home there is that if God told me to do it by the time I got there there'd be whole [Laughter] hello well repeat 'god what's that doing that's putting God's Word first that's what Joshua did at the River Jordan he put God's Word first whoo glory he will give greats to go through it that's right just don't worry they help me Lord just don't worry but keep your eyes on Christ so that lets me know with this statement how do I deal with that and overcome even and that worries just don't worry keep your eyes on Christ so look to him in this and he will see through for he's the only one that can take us through you see these trials they're instruments of his molding remember when the Lord Jesus we referred to this here over a few weeks when he said let this cup pass from me it was personal only he this trial was only him and we see that he could have called even when he was there on the cross he could have called there were legions right there right there Dane's was all gathered around he testified of that I would have had to done think of this all he would have had their done is summons they would have come but you see he was submitted to the will of the father brother Bram takes this part up and three kinds of believers brother Branham you know when you you go back over that message three kinds of believers because you know I've been preaching out of that for me many months now on trials brother Bentham lays that out within their on the believers and what he deals with is that loyalty of the heart and he shows he shows that the believers walking within that word steadfast through the midst of all the testing all the trials you've got something to do brother BEM saying God's got something for you to do you may have some heartaches and some troubles you may have some disappointments in better ahead disappointments what are disappointments their disappointments things that you wanted to have a certain way or expected episode way and it didn't yeah disappointments but do we pray to shun them no but here's how we pray Lord take me through them whatever they is whatever it is don't let me escape that Wow trying on praying about the track the Lord don't let me escape them why because these trials are given to perfect you and I and to bring out the purpose of God to a more clear reality you say well if the purpose of God is already in me what do the trials do the trials are melding you down that Christ might come forward if they're set for me see that if they're set from me just give me grace to go through that that's all brother Branham says concerning this we all know about the the trial the tests that brother Branham went through libram says I think of my wife I think I included this yeah I did I think of my wife twenty-two years old and just merely a girl a little mother there when the papers gave a headline here a young mother Reverend just dies what think of this I was reading over this I saw and this never had dawned on me before not only did he have to endure of seeing this but then a newspaper headline come out you with me a newspaper headline you you you try to walk in a restaurant they even have the newspapers out in front of you you walk by this headline was out there you're telling me that God didn't allow Satan to put that headline out there that's part of the test as well after it's all done then you have this headline oh how my heart bled I didn't know what to do but today look at this I know it was all working for my good it was one who came through and he wasn't standing there bitter I know the life had to be ground and twisted and squeezed to get what in it was out there was too much what's that say Branum too much Branham in there had to be squeezed out before God could make himself known you can put your last name in there I can put my last name in there was too much of it and God had to squeeze that out true there was too much of you in you till God had to squeeze it out through trials and while that squeezing was coming on it's hard but after a while the skeered the skies clear back then you see the purpose of God I know my Redeemer liveth in it goes on had me squeezed out too much browning something like he's gonna call me next all of you too much too much of you in you and he had to squeeze it out you see look how the Prophet is speaking of this look I was speaking of it he receives this it was all for the purpose of God within his life God allowed him to make the decision to listen to his mother-in-law you see even within the decision but notice look how the sovereignty of God is working the sovereignty of God is working in everything to do what think of this this event that happened way back there it prepared him listen to me now that event prepared him along with others to be able to stand there in the third pool in the opening of the word and stand there and say many of my friends have left me many have deserted me all of those experiences even that in Africa remember with the amoeba all of those were experiences preparing him you know I say well if that was in his life why didn't just come out God has his way of bringing out what is in us and tests and trials reduce the flesh missus why James could say blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord had promised to them that love him look how Paul makes mention this in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 3 I'm coming down we are bound to think God always for you brethren as it is me because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith Paul didn't say we're glorying in the Churches of God because there's no other Church that has more signs and wonders and miracles Paul said we're glorying in other churches where we went we're testifying of the patience and the faith in your lives because with patience and faith hey the signs and wonders miracles they're there they're there and they'll be there when we have need of it in all for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure remember how brother branham in the message he talks about garnet peak where he preaches the message he preaches garnets funeral service and he titles I am the resurrection or life the RAM talks about there's so much within that message when you listen to the conversations that brother Branham shares between him and garnet peak brother Branham took so much from those moments his lone life brother brems own life he said my life it was just challenged by that you can take that from that message and brother Branham he makes this statement he says I can remember how that garnet you know garnet one of the things garnet you know with that with with the disease that he had you know his arms and limbs and things like that had to be kind of lifted up like that even brother Branham would talk about my mind I was I want to say it right now my mind I forgot its sister had he had he writes sister what was her name anybody remember that was the Edith Edith remember how even you see pictures of Edith and how Edith was and brother Branham was even admiring the testimony of faith in her life in the condition that she was in yet the testimony of faith and brother branham is talking about garnet peak right here in the same way now garnet you know he brother branham asked him he said garnet he said what if you could have your life and get out of it he was an 18 year old boy he said one of you could get on here and run up and down the street in a race car and up and down there and you know girls and everything else he said brother branham I wouldn't trade one place where I'm at now to be there it was a love of his life brother brems says he was an example to in that second pair he was an example to for me of his patience never to complain just the will of God be done now has placed him before Sanada has taken him out of our president I don't think about that even how garnet was there garnet was a product of receiving the message of the Lord Jesus Christ he was a product of receiving the Lord Jesus Christ think of this now Paul could say you're the seal of mine Apostleship to be able to look in to see that word has produced even in garnets life and brother Brahma as he's looking at he says for me it's an example of his patience God never healed him of that as far as in this life and yet he and brother Branham were friends think about that even the sister who was in the wheelchair for the RAM talks about it and power transformation and he commends he said how many times a prayer has been made over the sister ease of it perhaps you know it's just the place in life but you see God and God has testimonies witnesses that said it don't matter if I could walk or not he's still God he had testimonies right here with garnet it got gone it didn't have to be made well in this life to have a testimony he had a testimony that in afflictions in de-stresses and all of this he was patient I look around here tonight you know I think about this I thought about this you know for months and you see different ones and you know and you see just the testimony in each and each life in each heart I'd say sometimes you don't what you don't realize is as a pastor what an encouragement that is see sometimes people don't know everything that you've been through and it's not like I know everything that you've been through but I do know perhaps more than others know but then yet to see is standing faithful to see all of that you know one encouragement that is I mean what if we came in here it was a changeover all the time you know what if it was a turnover all the time I'm looking to say man I wonder what's happening when was the word having an effect but to see a word that's moving and building in the hearts of the people how many the things that you might think all those I mean literal me are little in just literal you but to see the testimony of Jesus Christ holding in the midst when some you've gone through some of the greatest greatest greatest trials in your life maybe of going through one right now but yet to see within at all patience in afflictions in de-stresses hey the is the kind of people I want to say come pray for me pray from me brother pray for me sister brother brems talks about in Jesus at the door I love this quote I am done but brother Graham says isn't it a grand feeling to know that God's grace has carried some of you here through twenty and thirty years of trials and persecutions it that wonderful through it's a grand what makes it a grand feeling because you know that it's not you that kept you it's God keeping you through many dangers toils and snares I have already come here's Grace has brought me safe thus far and here's grace will take me safely home God did that for you it shows that you're a real child of God and he has taken you into fellowship some day in the face of all that's criticized you you'll be glorified and made a body like unto his own glorious body at his coming and we wait for that blessed a grand feeling he had begun the good work in you in me we will perform it to the day of Jesus Christ we are his witnesses through through the waters through the rivers through the fire through the test through the trials His grace is sufficient you loved him tonight let's pray but anyone like to be remembered in prayer tonight we pray god bless your hands god bless you as we pray would you pray for me as well Heavenly Father Lord we come to this part Lord of the service Lord how that we can look upon these things in your word and we can see Lord of your grace that has truly truly in our lives proven sufficient Lord Lord Jesus how we want to say that we thank you the Lord that you have brought us through through many dangers toils and snares father tonight you know Lord the request behind every one of our hearts Lord Jesus I pray that father that you would grant to us Lord the strength grant to us that grace to go through the trials in the tests that you have laid out before us Lord strengthen Lord as you do each time and you refresh as we've come through a test and a trap you give strength to a slide we see that word we are witnesses of it Lord for every one of my brothers and sisters Lord every every request Lord we ask that God that you would just Lord be ever so personal and minister Lord to them each and every one of us Lord just what we have need for Lord it's not a question of if it's when we come through the waters when we come through the fire when the flame is kindled what a promise you are with the school father were resting this great rock of Revelation Lord in our hearts it's the very anchor of our lives Lord keeping us moored and we see Oh God you're great more and more - great master plan unfolding for our lives Oh Lord Jesus through each of these things Lord father throughout this assembly called you have been and you are faithful I think of Ruth Lord if it had not been the death of her husband Lord Sita never made it back to the Israel but she was part of the mystery of Christ so that which took place was a part that that mystery had come to a fool unveiling in her life Lord Lord Jesus that's the same for each and every one of us as your children Lord you are that rock Lord you are that resting place you are that anchor in our life Oh God that holds us Lord Oh God the testimony Lord in our life is because the testimony of Jesus Christ Oh father without you Lord there would be no testimony Lord but all God it's your life Lord displayed Lord as Paul could say we are always delivered unto death for his sake that his life might be made manifest through our mortal bodies Oh God help us Lord not to worry but to keep our eyes upon you know Oh God we don't pray Lord to dodge the trials but we ask for your grace see us through lord help us father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
