[25:34] that kind of a God tonight? Amen. A God
[25:36] who's tremendous. His strength will
[25:38] never fail and he will never let us
[25:40] down. Aren't you glad about that
[25:41] tonight? Woo! Praise the Lord. Amen.

[25:52] tonight.
[25:55] When I come into his presence,
[26:02] I humble myself.
[26:06] I lift up both my hands
[26:11] and I
[26:13] begin
[26:15] to worship
[26:18] him.
[26:22] Yes, I
[26:24] will worship
[26:26] him. Let's stay right there in that
[26:28] first verse. Oh, when I come into his
[26:34] presence,

[26:44] and I
[26:46] begin

[27:07] he's done for me,
[27:12] he has redeemed.
[27:18] Oh, hallelujah.
[27:20] And we come.
[27:24] It's just because
[27:27] I know that he is God.
[27:32] Oh, and for all
[27:36] he's done for me.
[27:41] He has redeemed.
[27:44] And
[27:46] thank you, Jesus.

[29:19] redeemed
[29:21] and said,
[29:23] "Oh, hallelujah." And because
[29:29] it's just because I know that he is God
[29:36] for all
[29:38] for all
[29:40] he's done.
[29:43] All he's done for you and for me he's

[33:28] you are awesome in this place. Mighty
[33:34] God.
[33:37] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm grateful that he's
[33:42] not just awesome here,
[33:45] &gt;&gt; but I'm grateful that he's awesome here.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can look in your life and
[33:51] sense the Lord has touched your life.
[33:53] It's been awesome.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Even through all the different degrees
[33:57] and how God has brought us along in our
[34:00] journey. And he's still he's still
[34:03] bringing us along. You know, we're
[34:06] standing here tonight. We're here seated
[34:08] tonight standing
[34:11] and we're trusting him.
[34:15] You know, in one reality, it's just some
[34:18] things that Brother Trevor and I just
[34:19] just fellowshipping about, you know,
[34:21] within today. And it's really the the
[34:24] real heart of the gospel is rest.
[34:29] and just how that it's not about what
[34:31] you can do.
[34:33] It's about accepting what he's already
[34:36] done. It's the same way in every in
[34:38] every part of our life. It's, you know,
[34:41] you've heard me give my testimony many
[34:42] times. There wasn't one thing that I
[34:44] quit. Wasn't one thing I stopped, but
[34:48] it's what he did. Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; And it was, as we heard last night when
[34:53] brother Trevor, we were with with the
[34:55] with the young people, it's one choice
[34:58] after another choice after another
[34:59] choice. And you know, one thing I'm
[35:01] grateful about God. I'm glad that God
[35:03] didn't get me and push me behind the
[35:05] back and say, "Come on, boy. You need to
[35:06] keep you need you need I'm glad that God
[35:09] he's not a pusher. It's not the three
[35:11] pushes. It's the three pulls.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Not the three shves.
[35:18] It's the three pulls. It's it's God
[35:20] pulling on our hearts. It's God dealing
[35:22] with our hearts. And I'm so grateful for
[35:25] that. Aren't you? Amen. That's what
[35:27] we're here tonight. I I just so
[35:29] appreciate each and every one of you the
[35:30] sacrifice being out here tonight on this
[35:34] nice, warm, lovely Northern Ohio
[35:37] evening.
[35:40] It is warm compared to what we're going
[35:42] to be facing on Monday. But it's good to
[35:45] be together, isn't it? And I appreciate
[35:47] it. just uh want to say thank you. I
[35:49] just so appreciate your sacrifice and I
[35:51] know there's always things you have to
[35:53] lay aside on Saturday where you in order
[35:56] to be here for the meeting and but I
[35:58] believe and I pray that God will just so
[35:59] richly bless you.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; How many say that say Lord you you've
[36:02] done it before
[36:04] &gt;&gt; and I pray that God just blesses each of
[36:06] us ju each of you so richly. Amen.
[36:09] Tonight amen for all the efforts and
[36:11] sacrifice that's been made. And we're
[36:14] just we're we're glad to have our friend
[36:16] with us tonight.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Trevor is a friend.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a real friend here to
[36:21] Believer Spoken Word Tabernacle as well
[36:23] as to uh Brother Nathaniel and and the
[36:25] saints there. And of course, Brother
[36:27] Nathaniel wasn't able to be here
[36:28] tonight. Um just some sickness. And of
[36:31] course, we know what that's about. And
[36:33] so, we want to just hold Sister Charity
[36:35] and some of the kids up in prayer. And I
[36:37] know we've got different ones that would
[36:39] have been here as well, but of sickness.
[36:41] But I'm thankful he's still Jehovah
[36:43] Rafa.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we just thank God. We want to
[36:46] remember, I don't know if on the request
[36:48] it was read about Sister Rachel Hannah.
[36:50] We sent that out to you, but please be
[36:53] in prayer for her uh tomorrow morning.
[36:56] Um that for the the surgery and also
[36:59] just want to have prayer that the Lord
[37:00] will just there's she's been able to get
[37:03] comfortable. But those of you know what
[37:05] it's like when you're in the hospital
[37:06] and there's only so much with that they
[37:09] can give you to kind of, you know, calm
[37:11] you down. So, she has to have her
[37:13] gallbladder removed tomorrow morning. U
[37:16] but we we thank God for his mercy.
[37:19] And we thank God for doctors because God
[37:21] performs miracles as the prophet taught
[37:23] us through surgery. So, we just um maybe
[37:26] as we stand and we can just have special
[37:29] prayer for sister Rachel and also
[37:30] brother brother Nathaniel's family and I
[37:32] know others and we may have already
[37:34] prayed about it but I don't believe we
[37:35] can pray too much.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so let's just pray together
[37:40] and as we pray just invite God just uh
[37:43] Lord speak to my heart. You know my
[37:44] needs and um I take take the gift in
[37:48] brother Trevor's life and just just

[37:52] Father, oh God, how we are so thankful
[37:55] for your mercy and your grace. So
[37:58] grateful, oh God, to really be a real
[38:01] partaker of what you have done on
[38:03] Calvary and through the resurrection. I
[38:06] appreciate, Lord, as I look out here
[38:08] just seeing all the sacrifice, Lord,
[38:10] where I know things have been laid aside
[38:12] in order to be here tonight. Father, if
[38:15] I could see that, how much more can you
[38:18] see, Lord? I pray that God that you
[38:21] would so pour out of your blessings Lord
[38:24] to every need tonight.
[38:26] Grant it Lord may you overrun our cups
[38:29] Lord with your presence.
[38:32] I pray that God that you'll just move
[38:34] Lord Brother Trevor aside and just speak
[38:37] to our hearts in such a personal way.
[38:40] And Lord we remember Lord Brother
[38:43] Nathaniel's family tonight. Lord they
[38:46] wanted to be here. And I know there's
[38:48] others, Lord, in the assembly here that
[38:50] wanted to be as well. Would you go,
[38:52] Lord, to Sister Charity's need and the
[38:55] children there, Lord, and and sickness,
[38:58] Lord God, like them. There's many of us,
[39:00] Lord, been through weeks of it, Lord.
[39:03] But I pray that God, you'll touch them.
[39:05] May the angel of the Lord, make a
[39:07] visitation right there tonight, Lord
[39:09] God. May you touch them, Lord, and give
[39:11] them strength, Lord. I pray in their
[39:13] bodies, Lord, through each one for every
[39:16] need. And for Sister Rachel, Lord, I
[39:19] pray, God, that you would just move
[39:21] down, Lord, in that hospital there
[39:23] tonight, Lord. I pray that God that you
[39:25] would just just sweep over her, Lord,
[39:27] tonight. I pray, Father, may there be
[39:29] such a calmness and such a peace, Lord
[39:32] God. And there'd be such a rest, Lord
[39:34] God, that she would, Lord, receive
[39:36] tonight.
[39:37] Father, we just ask that you would guide
[39:39] and direct, Lord, the hands of the
[39:41] doctors tomorrow. Lord, we know it's
[39:43] there's nothing that's impossible with
[39:45] you, Lord. So, Father, as we commit,
[39:48] Lord, all of these things into your
[39:50] hands, we want to say thank you that you
[39:52] are a faithful and merciful high priest,
[39:54] Lord. A throne of grace that Lord, we
[39:56] have been invited, Lord, to approach,
[39:58] Lord. a name, Lord God, that Father,
[40:01] when we take that name, devils, Lord,
[40:03] begin to tremble, Lord, for it's in the
[40:06] name of Jesus Christ, we ask these
[40:08] things and your blessings, Lord, upon
[40:11] the people, Lord, and for every need
[40:13] tonight, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[40:16] Amen. Amen. Brother Trevor, come on. You
[40:22] are awesome in this place, mighty God.
[40:31] Yes, you are awesome in this place
[40:36] of the father.

[40:46] To you our lives we raise.
[40:50] You are awesome in this place. My God
[40:56] mighty God.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Yes you are awesome in this place. My
[41:04] mighty God.
[41:08] You are awesome in this race.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; I'm a father.
[41:15] Father,
[41:17] &gt;&gt; you are worthy of all praise.
[41:22] To you our arms we raise.
[41:26] You are awesome in this place.
[41:30] Mighty
[41:32] God.
[41:34] Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the presence of
[41:38] the mighty God?
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; He is awesome.
[41:44] Isn't it good to be just just good to be
[41:48] a believer? Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Good to be gathered together in the name
[41:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ. I want to just
[41:54] greet you and uh thank you musicians.
[41:56] Appreciate it very much. We'll get right
[41:59] into the word. Not that don't be scared
[42:03] there. Just, you know, we got to get
[42:06] right into the word. There's a lot.
[42:08] That's not what I mean. I just, you
[42:10] know, we we we've had a wonderful song
[42:12] service and I don't think we need much
[42:14] for introduction, so we can just get
[42:16] right into it. I'm excited about this
[42:18] this topic tonight. Have you turn to 1
[42:20] Corinthians chapter 6? Um, we'll just
[42:22] look at a few verses here before we get
[42:24] into our thought. And um,
[42:32] of course, happy to be back in our
[42:35] normal January thing. Brother Samuel put
[42:38] me on the calendar before I even
[42:40] confirmed with him that I was coming. I
[42:42] said, "Okay, brother." Like, "Hey, is
[42:44] you know, how's this work?" He's like,
[42:45] "It's already on the calendar." And I
[42:46] was like, "Well, I'm just now telling
[42:49] you I will be there." So, but um happy
[42:52] to happy to be back, of course, and and
[42:54] be in fellowship together. So 1
[42:56] Corinthians chapter 6, we'll look at
[42:59] verse 12,
[43:01] and it says, "All things are lawful unto
[43:04] me, but all things are not expedient.
[43:07] All things are lawful for me, but I will
[43:10] not be brought under the power of any."
[43:15] Also look at verse 19.
[43:17] What know ye not that your body is the
[43:20] temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in
[43:22] you, which ye have of God? and ye are
[43:26] not your own. Okay, the back screen's
[43:29] just in up tonight. That's fine. I have
[43:31] it here. It's all It's all good. I just
[43:33] wanted to make sure that that's that's
[43:35] working. So, praise the Lord. So, just
[43:38] just a real quick comment on this on
[43:40] this uh verse right here before we go to
[43:43] um chapter 15 for another verse. Um, so
[43:46] what what Paul is saying is here your
[43:48] body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,
[43:51] which which tells you that your body is
[43:55] not the Holy Ghost.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; It's the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; And that's a that's a pretty important
[44:01] distinction
[44:02] &gt;&gt; because sometimes we judge our body as
[44:04] if it should be the Holy Ghost,
[44:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:12] And that's not fair because it's the
[44:14] temple of the Holy Ghost
[44:16] &gt;&gt; which is in you which ye have of God and
[44:18] ye are not your own. Um looked at verse
[44:21] or chapter 15 and verse 31.
[44:25] We look at it and Paul says here I
[44:28] protest by your rejoicing which I have
[44:31] in Christ Jesus our Lord. I die daily.
[44:37] This is the Apostle Paul speaking. Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[44:44] Heavenly Father, Lord, we look to you
[44:46] tonight for everything. Father, we look
[44:48] to you as we've sang. You are awesome in
[44:51] this place. And we know because of your
[44:53] promise that you are here with us, Lord.
[44:55] We can feel your spirit, Lord. Lord,
[44:57] we're asking for your anointing, Lord,
[44:59] to to use me and to to speak to the
[45:02] hearts. And Lord, that we would that we
[45:04] would grow in you and that we would Lord
[45:07] that we would Lord whatever happens Lord
[45:10] may you be glorified
[45:12] &gt;&gt; because Lord we see that you are truth
[45:14] and that you are good Lord and Father we
[45:17] just want to be wrapped up in your love
[45:18] and in your truth father as brother
[45:20] Samuel said it how how this is just
[45:23] about rest father so tonight Lord may we
[45:26] rest may we truly see the rest that we
[45:30] have in you Lord God and Lord even as
[45:32] maybe I feel pressured, Lord, to perform
[45:35] or to preach well. But Father, may even
[45:37] myself, may I just rest that you may
[45:40] take hold of your gift and use it, Lord,
[45:43] tonight. We ask it, Lord, and give you
[45:45] the glory and honor and praise in the
[45:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[45:50] Amen. Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[45:55] So, this
[45:57] now that we've we've read 1 Corinthians,
[45:59] our title tonight is Romans 7.
[46:02] uh that which I do I allow not. But I
[46:06] want to look at these very quickly again
[46:08] in 1 Corinthians before we get into
[46:09] Romans 7 to recognize as as I've said
[46:12] this is this is the Apostle Paul
[46:14] speaking. He says I will not be brought
[46:17] under the power of any. Why is Paul
[46:20] talking about that? What is Paul saying?
[46:23] like, you know, we we we need to make
[46:25] sure and not that we're going to, you
[46:27] know, update our Bible versions and get
[46:29] out of King James or New King James,
[46:31] whatever it is you might use, you know,
[46:32] so that we can get in to some
[46:34] contemporary weird paraphrase or
[46:36] whatever, but but to like but to
[46:38] recognize like this language has meaning
[46:40] and and and you know, and we we look at
[46:42] it as, you know, so much so many times
[46:44] we look at Paul and it's like that's
[46:46] old, that's history, that's you know,
[46:48] it's it's not like now, but it is like
[46:50] now like Paul Paul, it's not like Paul
[46:52] was different than us. It's not like
[46:54] Paul is going through different, you
[46:56] know, experiences. I mean, yes, he
[46:58] doesn't have a car. He doesn't have air
[46:59] conditioning.
[47:00] You know, we'd pray for him, but you
[47:03] know, he's well, it was historical a
[47:06] bit, but you know, BUT IT'S BUT IT'S NOT
[47:07] THAT IT'S NOT THAT HE'S living a
[47:09] different life. It's not that he's
[47:10] feeling different FEELINGS OR HAVING
[47:11] DIFFERENT THOUGHTS like not that he's
[47:14] not dealing with different things. He's
[47:15] he's dealing with things that are
[47:17] PULLING AT HIS BODY that are pulling on
[47:20] his flesh to WHERE HE HAS SO TO WHERE HE
[47:24] IN in in a moment of of writing is
[47:26] writing and saying, "Look, there are all
[47:28] kinds OF THINGS THAT MAY BE GOOD OR
[47:30] MAYBE BAD, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
[47:32] BROUGHT UNDER THE POWER OF THAT THING.
[47:35] Though I WOULD FEEL PULLED BY THOSE
[47:37] THINGS, though I would be susceptible
[47:41] to those things." Yes, even the apostle
[47:44] Paul, the first church age messenger
[47:47] would have been susceptible to be bring
[47:50] being brought under the power of of any
[47:52] kind of habit or any dare I say to use a
[47:56] 2026 now word addiction
[48:00] &gt;&gt; because if YOU'RE BROUGHT UNDER THE
[48:02] POWER of something and you're going why
[48:04] am I doing this? I I don't I shouldn't
[48:06] and but I just I can't seem TO HELP
[48:08] MYSELF. WHAT IS THAT? But that's an
[48:10] addiction. AND SO PAUL IS SAYING, I
[48:12] DON'T WANT TO BE BROUGHT INTO ANY
[48:14] ADDICTION. I DON'T WANT TO BE BROUGHT
[48:15] UNDER THE POWER OF ANYTHING. EVEN if
[48:17] it's a dis, you know, EVEN IF IT'S A
[48:19] GOOD ADDICTION,
[48:24] &gt;&gt; what's a good addiction? Brother Trevor
[48:25] was like, "Well, we have no problem with
[48:27] coffee addictions,
[48:29] you know. We just we just don't we just
[48:32] I might not be invited back anyway."
[48:35] BUT, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE
[48:36] PRO LIKE THAT'S IT'S LIKE, WELL, THAT'S
[48:37] FINE. You know, it's drugs, but it's you
[48:39] know, it's legal.
[48:41] And it's it's socially acceptable drug
[48:44] addictions. That's that's what it is.
[48:46] And you know that, you know, like don't
[48:48] just point your FINGERS AT BROTHER
[48:50] SAMUEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, you have yours,
[48:52] too.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; You know, and we'll be, you know,
[48:57] brought under the power of me. No, and
[48:59] not be invited back. And praise the
[49:01] Lord. There we go. SO, SO EVEN THE
[49:03] APOSTLE PAUL IS TALKING ABOUT I DON'T
[49:05] WANT TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE POWER OF
[49:06] THIS THING. I DON'T WANT THESE things to
[49:08] CONTROL ME BECAUSE I WANT MY FREEDOM in
[49:11] Christ though some things are lawful and
[49:13] some things wouldn't be. I DON'T WANT TO
[49:14] BE BROUGHT I DON'T WANT THESE THINGS
[49:16] CONTROLLING ME. And we we talked to the
[49:19] youth uh last night and and we talked
[49:21] about liberty and choice and how you
[49:23] know how these things go together. You
[49:25] can't have choice IF YOU DON'T HAVE
[49:26] LIBERTY. And so if you GIVE AWAY SOME OF
[49:28] YOUR LIBERTY TO SOME ADDICTION, IT NOW
[49:30] IS NARROWING CHOICE DOWN IN YOUR LIFE.
[49:33] AND SO THEN AS WE SAID, THE body is the
[49:35] TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND YOU ARE
[49:37] NOT your own. But that that does mean
[49:39] that yes, your body is not the Holy
[49:41] Ghost. Your flesh until look until we
[49:44] take until Jesus comes and we take a
[49:47] rapture and and are there with him for
[49:49] three and a half years a marriage supper
[49:51] and come back on this earth in the
[49:53] millennium WITH A GLORIFIED BODY BECAUSE
[49:55] WE'LL BE CHANGED in a moment in a
[49:57] twinkling of an eye. Your flesh will
[49:59] never be perfect until the millennium.
[50:06] That's the Bible.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Guess what?
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus died to make your flesh perfect.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; It was his atonement.
[50:21] DON'T EXPECT THAT YOUR FLESH WILL BE
[50:23] PERFECT OR SOMEHOW YOU WON'T YOU WON'T
[50:25] EVER HAVE A FAILURE OR EVER make a
[50:27] mistake.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; This is the sermon where brother Trevor
[50:30] helps you feel good about your own sins.
[50:33] No,
[50:35] no, there's a point to it here. You
[50:37] might feel that way for a while. Um, but
[50:39] we're because we we want to talk about
[50:41] righteousness and how how we become
[50:43] righteous. And so anyway, and then we we
[50:46] we into 1 Corinthians 15 again, we're
[50:49] talking about the Apostle Paul, seventh
[50:50] church age messenger, one of the stars
[50:52] and the right hand of God in the book of
[50:54] Revelation. Like what a position. But he
[50:57] HIMSELF HAS TO DIE DAILY. WHY?
[51:03] Because there's things in his life,
[51:05] there's things in his flesh that he is
[51:07] struggling over that he is that he is
[51:10] learning to overcome by the sacrificial
[51:13] death of his own will to that thing.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; How many want to be like the Apostle
[51:20] Paul?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; You know, you know, I mean, hey,
[51:26] cuz he was a man
[51:29] &gt;&gt; like we are.
[51:31] or woman, of course.
[51:34] So, we want to turn now into Romans
[51:36] chapter 7.
[51:38] If is it okay if I lower this a little
[51:40] bit because I just feel like I'm popping
[51:42] it and if it's a problem, I'll bring it
[51:44] back up. But, um, Romans chapter 7,
[51:49] we're going to start at verse 14. And so
[51:52] I, you know, I was I was talking to a
[51:54] friend of mine about this chapter and I
[51:56] was like, "Yeah, Romans 7, you know, and
[51:57] I'm just talking about as if as if he
[51:59] just knows what Romans 7 is." And, you
[52:01] know, he's like, "Trevor, I hate you so
[52:03] much because you're so smart. You know
[52:04] these things, you know?" I was like,
[52:06] "Could you tell me what you're talking
[52:07] about because you just said ROMANS 7 IS
[52:09] IF I KNEW?" AND I WAS LIKE, AND I'M
[52:11] LIKE, "OKAY." like yeah that's this you
[52:13] know it's this the which I do I allow
[52:15] not you know scripture because AND AND I
[52:17] JUST I just thought like everybody knows
[52:19] that because I just remember you know
[52:21] being 15 16 whatever teen and reading
[52:24] this scripture and going oho
[52:28] someone knows me
[52:32] &gt;&gt; like like Lord help me from help me to
[52:36] move my life from Romans 7 to Romans 8
[52:40] &gt;&gt; you know I really want to get in Roman
[52:41] Romans 8 cuz I feel like I'm STUCK IN
[52:44] ROMANS 7. AND SO I just feel like like I
[52:47] just expected that when I say Romans 7,
[52:49] you know, that everybody understood
[52:51] because everyone else has been there.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Like you read this, you went, "Yes, this
[52:56] is just it should be LIKE WE SHOULD ALL
[52:58] KNOW WHAT THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S just our
[53:01] life,"
[53:03] &gt;&gt; you know. And so anyway, maybe maybe
[53:05] you'll understand more when we read this
[53:06] if you don't yet. But um verse 14, for
[53:10] we know that the law is spiritual, but I
[53:12] am carnal sold under sin. For that which
[53:16] I do,
[53:18] I allow not. For what I would, that do
[53:21] I, that do I not. But what I hate, that
[53:24] do I. If then I do that which I would
[53:26] not, I consented to the law that is
[53:27] good. You know, and if I would just sped
[53:29] through this, you know, if I was just
[53:30] reading this at, you know, at preacher
[53:33] fast, you know, for that which I would,
[53:34] I do, I allow not. For that would I do
[53:36] not. That what I hate, that do I. If
[53:38] then I do that which I do, and
[53:40] everybody's like, wait, whoa, how what,
[53:45] Paul? What?
[53:47] you know, and and and sometimes we we go
[53:49] through this and we're like, I have
[53:53] maybe William Shakespeare understood
[53:54] what you were saying, but uh but I'm not
[53:57] William Shakespeare, so I mean so it's
[53:59] JUST LIKE LET'S SLOW DOWN LIKE LET'S
[54:01] PROCESS this like let's look at this,
[54:03] you know, and so for that which I do uh
[54:06] for that which I do I allow not. SO PAUL
[54:09] IS SAYING THE THINGS THAT I DO,
[54:12] these are the things that I don't wish I
[54:14] I don't allow myself to do. Wait, wait a
[54:16] second. If you don't allow yourself to
[54:19] do it, why are you doing it? Right?
[54:22] You know, for that
[54:25] for that which I would I don't do.
[54:31] But but here but the things that I Oh, I
[54:35] hate that thing, man. I will Oh, I hate
[54:38] that. I Yeah, we're doing this.
[54:44] How how many want to be like the Apostle
[54:46] Paul?
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Do you think he's JUST DO YOU THINK HE'S
[54:52] just writing like Yeah, mere mortals are
[54:54] like this. Uh not
[54:57] seventh church age messengers like
[54:59] myself, you know, we don't uh I'm
[55:02] writing about your experience, not mine.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; No, Paul is writing something very
[55:09] human, VERY VERY NORMAL. PAUL IS WRITING
[55:11] ABOUT HIS own life,
[55:13] &gt;&gt; he's not I do, I allow. He's talking
[55:17] about himself,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; If then I do that which I would not, I
[55:23] consent unto the law that it is good.
[55:26] Now then, it is no more I that do it,
[55:30] but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know
[55:32] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[55:35] no good thing. For to will is present
[55:37] with me, but how to perform that which
[55:39] is good I find not. So Paul is like this
[55:43] is these are the things that are good. I
[55:45] need to do this. I know I should do
[55:48] this. Everything in me says do this.
[55:57] Oh, hey.
[56:04] For the good that I would,
[56:08] I don't do the evil which I would not
[56:12] that I do.
[56:15] Now then, if I do that that I would not,
[56:19] it's no more I that do it, but it's sin
[56:23] that dwelleth in me.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I find then a law that when I would do
[56:27] good, evil is present with me. For I
[56:30] delight in the law after the inward man.
[56:34] But I see another law in my members,
[56:36] waring against the law of my mind, and
[56:39] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[56:40] sin, which is in my members.
[56:44] And I really love this next verse. I'm
[56:46] so glad Paul wrote this next verse
[56:49] because what I love about it is Paul
[56:52] Paul, you know, Paul exclaims something
[56:54] here and I'm just like, "Thank you,
[56:56] Paul, BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE FELT like
[56:58] this AND NOT KNOWN HOW DO I WHAT DO I
[57:00] SAY?" AND PAUL SAYS, "OH WRETCHED MAN
[57:04] THAT I am,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; who shall deliver me FROM THE BODY OF
[57:08] THIS DEATH?" AND I'm so like I CANNOT
[57:11] TELL YOU HOW OFTEN I HAVE QUOTED THIS
[57:15] VERSE.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe not out loud, maybe under my
[57:20] breath as I go. I hate that thing. Oh,
[57:22] wretched man.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; God, deliver me from the body of this
[57:27] death.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; I hate myself.
[57:32] Why am I doing this?
[57:36] The Apostle Paul gave us this language.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; You see, it's this sermon about you
[57:41] feeling better about your failures.
[57:43] It's all we're going to talk about.
[57:50] I thank God through Jesus Christ our
[57:52] Lord. So then with the mind I myself
[57:55] self serve the law of God, but with the
[57:57] flesh the law of sin. SO HERE WE ARE AND
[58:01] WE FIND OURSELVES JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE
[58:03] PAUL FOUND OUR HIMSELF STRUGGLING with
[58:06] things in our life. Struggling with
[58:09] powers, ADDICTIONS IS OUR IS OUR 2026
[58:13] WORD FOR IT. If there's something you
[58:14] hate that you're doing
[58:18] &gt;&gt; I mean what do we call that today?
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Like I mean it's it's an addiction. I
[58:22] hate that thing.
[58:24] Yes, SIR.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; I NEED POWER OVER THIS THING.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT do I DO? CUZ I SHOULDN'T DO THAT
[58:32] AND IT'S WRONG. AND SO TODAY WE
[58:34] STRUGGLE. THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S MANY
[58:36] THINGS OUT THERE, YOU KNOW, AND AND YOU
[58:38] KNOW, BACK IN THE YOU KNOW, BACK IN the
[58:39] days of your I said that recently and
[58:42] somebody was like, "What on earth does
[58:43] that even mean?" We're just old days,
[58:45] you know?
[58:50] How old? I older. Okay. Just just let's
[58:52] go 1800s. Okay, if there was an
[58:55] addiction in the 1800s, it was, you
[58:57] know, in somebody was ADDICTED TO
[58:59] SOMETHING, WE PROBABLY KNEW BECAUSE, YOU
[59:01] KNOW, THERE WAS USUALLY A SUBSTANCE
[59:02] THERE. There was there was smoking,
[59:04] there was drinking, there was, you know,
[59:06] there was there was something on the
[59:08] outside that could be seen that was an
[59:11] addiction. And everybody, you know, so
[59:13] there was a little bit of a social, you
[59:14] know, uh, stigma to an addiction because
[59:18] you could, you know, at least you like,
[59:19] yeah, that's the town drunk.
[59:23] What does that mean? IS THAT THAT'S THE
[59:24] GUY IN the town that's that's addicted
[59:26] to alcohol and and and maybe he even
[59:29] hates it, but he's he just he's
[59:31] screaming, "Oh, wretched man. I I
[59:33] shouldn't have done that." Anyway, you
[59:34] know, LIKE, RIGHT, HE'S GOT PROBLEMS.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; But it's 2026 now. We're so like we're
[59:44] we it's those ARE STILL THOSE ARE STILL
[59:46] PROBLEMATIC. BUT BUT THERE'S so many
[59:49] more now because science in OUR DAY HAS
[59:52] FIGURED OUT HOW ADDICTIONS even happen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'VE NOW HIJACKED AND tuned to
[1:00:00] addict you so that they can make money
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; AND MONETIZED ADDICTIONS. AND NOW
[1:00:06] THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
[1:00:08] NOW THEIR VIDEO GAMES AND PHONES AND
[1:00:10] BLAH BLAH blah blah blah. SOCIAL MEDIA,
[1:00:12] ALL THIS STUFF THAT preachers preach
[1:00:14] about is so terrible in our age and
[1:00:15] killing us all.
[1:00:19] STOP DOING IT. NO, THAT'S NOT THIS
[1:00:21] SERMON. RIGHT.
[1:00:24] But it's that but if that's if like this
[1:00:26] sermon isn't for the unconverted, this
[1:00:28] sermon isn't YOU NEED JESUS COME. NO,
[1:00:30] THIS SERMON THIS SERMON UNDERSTANDS YOU.
[1:00:32] YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN SAVED. YOU'VE
[1:00:34] ALREADY BEEN CONVERTED. AND YOU YOU ARE
[1:00:36] FINDING YOURSELF DRAWN TO THINGS JUST
[1:00:39] LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And saying, "GOD, I'M STRUGGLING WITH
[1:00:44] THIS THING. MY I FEEL THEY'RE SO
[1:00:46] WRETCHED.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S SO MANY THINGS IN 2026. I'M
[1:00:51] BEING PULLED BY AND I KNOW IT'S NOT
[1:00:53] HEALTHY. I KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; you know. And so, you know, it's like,
[1:00:59] well, hey, what what do we do about it
[1:01:01] then? What what is it that we you know
[1:01:06] what's the answer? Brother Trevor, give
[1:01:07] us the sevenstep program to getting over
[1:01:11] social media in 2026. And if we follow
[1:01:14] your new guide available on
[1:01:15] messageteer.com, you can No, it's not
[1:01:17] there. I'm just kidding.
[1:01:21] I had to mention my website for Sister
[1:01:22] Kayla. She was like, "What? You have a
[1:01:24] website?"
[1:01:27] So anyway, but you know,
[1:01:32] brother Trevor, I WANT TO BE RIGHTEOUS.
[1:01:34] I WANT TO GET OVER THIS THING. I DON'T
[1:01:36] WANT TO CONTINUE TO SCREAM, oh wretched
[1:01:38] man that I am. WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT
[1:01:41] THIS? GIVE ME THE WAY. HOW WHAT'S PAUL
[1:01:44] GOING TO TELL US TO, HEY, TO GET OVER
[1:01:47] THIS THING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, SO THAT GOD
[1:01:49] CAN JUST PUT OURSELVES IN THE CHANNEL
[1:01:51] WHERE GOD JUST GOES BOOM, YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:01:53] THAT ANYMORE AND IT'S OVER FOR YOU.
[1:01:55] Anybody
[1:02:00] ever prayed that
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Lord just
[1:02:03] just I am so wretched.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Take this thing because you know I mean
[1:02:10] we are at you know 998 Lord. Two more
[1:02:13] and we're going to have to go to four
[1:02:14] digits and counting how many times I
[1:02:16] have failed in this thing. I obviously
[1:02:19] Lord am too much of a loser to get over
[1:02:23] this thing. And so I'm just going to
[1:02:25] need you to come and take this away.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; How we doing? Everybody there?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Anybody? Right. I mean, just so you
[1:02:40] know, is just me saying what I've said,
[1:02:43] what I've dealt with and and and surely
[1:02:45] YOU'VE STRUGGLED IN THE SAME IN SOME
[1:02:47] THINGS IN THE SAME AREAS AND AND AND GOD
[1:02:50] SCREAMED OUT, "OH, WRETCHED MAN THAT I
[1:02:52] AM. WHO SHALL DELIVER ME FROM THE BODY
[1:02:54] of this death? And and so, YOU KNOW, AS
[1:02:57] I WAS STUDYING AND PUTTING THIS sermon
[1:02:59] together,
[1:03:00] um, Brother Barry had asked me to do a a
[1:03:03] youth meeting. And so, this this was on
[1:03:05] my heart and I was just putting some
[1:03:06] things together and I was looking for
[1:03:08] something. I remember on my on my phone.
[1:03:10] And I don't even remember what I was
[1:03:12] looking for, but I was I was um you
[1:03:14] know, searching through some some older
[1:03:16] texts and and I came across this this
[1:03:20] text message that I had gotten from a
[1:03:22] sister and and you know and I just AND I
[1:03:25] WAS LIKE, WOW, THIS IS Romans 7 in
[1:03:29] modern language. And I just thought, how
[1:03:32] man, I'm gonna I'm gonna use this. And
[1:03:34] so after I got done, I asked her for
[1:03:37] permission and she was good with it. I
[1:03:39] should have probably asked before, but
[1:03:42] well anyway, so we redacted the names
[1:03:44] and protected the innocent and all of
[1:03:46] that and but I thought but BUT IT YOU
[1:03:49] KNOW I JUST I SAW THIS AND I THOUGHT
[1:03:51] Lord
[1:03:53] how many how many are right here and and
[1:03:57] need and and need ENCOURAGEMENT AND NEED
[1:03:59] TO KNOW WHAT WHAT GOD IS SAYING AND HOW
[1:04:01] HE'S HOW WHAT THE PLAN THAT HE HAS FOR
[1:04:04] US. And so I thought, well, this would
[1:04:05] be I I just believe that this would this
[1:04:07] would be very meaningful for us to
[1:04:09] understand Romans chapter 7, maybe in a
[1:04:12] more modern language.
[1:04:15] Hello, brother Trevor. I'm so and I'm
[1:04:17] sorry for disturbing you. There's just
[1:04:18] something I would like to talk to you
[1:04:20] about. You see, I have been a Christian
[1:04:23] my whole life.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; This is the this is an interactive part
[1:04:28] of the sermon, just so you know. So if
[1:04:31] you can identify with this sermon when I
[1:04:33] pause awkwardly, you just go ahead and
[1:04:35] raise your hand.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; So okay, I was born in the message.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And all my life I tried to live a
[1:04:45] Christian life.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; I got baptized at 13 years old. We can
[1:04:51] act like I got baptized young in the
[1:04:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:58] Okay. And I always tried to live how I
[1:05:02] ought to
[1:05:07] not not so bad, right? Okay. Pretty good
[1:05:10] person here.
[1:05:12] However,
[1:05:15] I started to go downhill since a few
[1:05:18] weeks. There was a time I felt far from
[1:05:21] God because of sin.
[1:05:27] That's right.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; So, I would be ashamed and I would feel
[1:05:35] too bad to pray
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; and go to church.
[1:05:46] I sinned and I did something I knew I
[1:05:50] could not do but still did it.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Wait, where have I heard that before? I
[1:05:57] I I the things I could not that I do.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And I was like, I don't know if this
[1:06:04] sister knows it, but she's identifying
[1:06:06] herself with the Apostle Paul.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Sounds terrible, doesn't it? I mean, my
[1:06:12] goodness, how could you identify
[1:06:14] yourself with the Apostle Paul? I mean,
[1:06:16] out of all of the scripture that you
[1:06:18] could people in this scripture, you can
[1:06:19] identify yourself, you know, it's not
[1:06:21] Herod, right? I mean this is like you're
[1:06:23] you're SPEAKING LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL
[1:06:26] not Herod
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; and after doing it I would feel bad and
[1:06:34] ask for forgiveness
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; but then when I'm in this situation
[1:06:44] again
[1:06:45] I would fall again
[1:06:48] and sin
[1:06:50] again.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks, bro. You You were getting
[1:06:55] ahead of me there, right?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; So, what advice do you give?
[1:07:07] Put yourself in my shoes.
[1:07:11] You got a text from a young person that
[1:07:15] needs help
[1:07:17] and this is what she's saying.
[1:07:21] What's the answer? Now, you don't have
[1:07:23] to shout out the answers. This is just
[1:07:24] that part where we just sit here and
[1:07:26] think about it and we come up with all
[1:07:28] the answers that we can come up with.
[1:07:30] And then, you know, Ben knows this is
[1:07:33] the part where it's like, doesn't matter
[1:07:34] what answer I come up with, it's going
[1:07:36] to be wrong. He's going to destroy it.
[1:07:41] What's like what but like what's our
[1:07:44] standard message answers? You know, like
[1:07:46] what do what ARE WE GOING TO SAY? What
[1:07:47] are we going to do? WHAT? WHAT? WELL,
[1:07:49] SISTER, YOU KNOW, UH PROBABLY BE GOOD TO
[1:07:52] get away from these things, you know,
[1:07:54] probably be good to be getting get some
[1:07:56] good meetings, you know, come to the
[1:07:57] altar, you know, talk to your pastor a
[1:08:00] little bit, you know, maybe I know like
[1:08:03] just get, you know, find a youth camp,
[1:08:06] sign up for a youth camp. You'll be
[1:08:07] there for an entire week. You'll be
[1:08:09] completely away from that thing. you'll
[1:08:11] have time to really reflect reflect and
[1:08:14] pray and come to the altar and seek the
[1:08:15] Lord and really really get some
[1:08:17] strength.
[1:08:19] Sound like a pretty good answer.
[1:08:25] No. No. Because you already know what
[1:08:27] the next slide's going to say. I'm
[1:08:28] pretty sure, right? This is like you're
[1:08:31] leading us to an answer we all think
[1:08:32] will be right. It obviously cannot be
[1:08:35] right. So then,
[1:08:39] SO I WAS HOPING THAT I MIGHT CHANGE at
[1:08:41] the camp
[1:08:43] and stop doing what I was doing and
[1:08:47] become a better Christian and that God
[1:08:51] would forgive me. So I prayed and cried
[1:08:54] and I felt blessed.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; You've been there.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank God for
[1:09:03] deliverance. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
[1:09:06] I'M NOT FALLING AGAIN. AND I WOULD NOT
[1:09:08] PERMIT it to happen again. And I felt
[1:09:10] good again. But then getting back home,
[1:09:15] I fell in the same situation again and
[1:09:19] sinned
[1:09:21] again.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I just get angry at myself and cry. And
[1:09:33] I think I SHOULD NOT PRAY BECAUSE GOD
[1:09:35] HAS TO BE upset and I'm scared he
[1:09:38] PUNISHES ME. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
[1:09:40] DO NOW BECAUSE I FEEL SO BAD, WRETCHED
[1:09:43] THAT I was blessed, blessed at the camp
[1:09:46] and that God forgave me and now it's
[1:09:48] like I threw all away by falling and
[1:09:52] sinning again.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Now it's LIKE I TRY TO HIDE FROM GOD.
[1:09:57] THE FLESH desires are just strong.
[1:10:01] and I do
[1:10:03] what I don't want to do
[1:10:08] because when I'm in the situation, it's
[1:10:12] like I'm not myself and I don't feel bad
[1:10:16] in the moment.
[1:10:26] But when I come back to myself,
[1:10:29] I start to cry and get angry at myself.
[1:10:31] Please, could you help me? Because I'm
[1:10:33] scared I get punished by God and he
[1:10:35] won't give me his blessings because of
[1:10:38] my attitude. I really don't know what I
[1:10:42] should do now.
[1:10:44] So, life tip, if if you don't want
[1:10:47] questions like this, don't start
[1:10:50] speaking internationally at youth camps.
[1:10:52] Just throwing that out there. JUST
[1:10:57] BECAUSE NOW, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY?
[1:11:00] What are you going to do, sister? Your
[1:11:02] life sounds uh surprisingly like my own.
[1:11:05] There's really nothing you can do. We're
[1:11:06] all in this together. And we just thank
[1:11:08] God for the grace of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:15] Go forth and
[1:11:18] trust God.
[1:11:21] I have no answer for you because
[1:11:25] we are the same.
[1:11:27] Just like the Apostle Paul.
[1:11:34] Well, that's not an answer. I guess I
[1:11:36] can't use that answer.
[1:11:38] That answer doesn't give any hope. That
[1:11:40] answer doesn't deal with any of the
[1:11:41] underlying issues. What are the
[1:11:43] underlying issues? What should we what
[1:11:45] should we look at? What how we how do I
[1:11:48] tell this the sister what she's crying
[1:11:49] out for? She wants to be righteous. She
[1:11:52] wants to do the things she she knows she
[1:11:55] should do. SHE WANTS TO DO THE THINGS
[1:11:57] THAT INSIDE IN HER DESIRES IN HER HEART
[1:12:00] OF HEARTS that Holy Spirit in her in her
[1:12:03] life. SHE'S SAYING THESE ARE THE THINGS
[1:12:04] I WANT TO DO. I WANT TO DO THEM. I HATE
[1:12:06] THOSE things and that's what I'm doing
[1:12:08] and I don't want to DO THOSE THINGS
[1:12:09] ANYMORE. I I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN
[1:12:11] AVENUES ANYMORE AND WAKE UP AND COME TO
[1:12:13] MYSELF AND GO,
[1:12:16] "What am I DOING HERE?
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; GOD forgive me."
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; COMING TO AN ALTAR AND repenting
[1:12:25] again and again and again until
[1:12:30] repentance fatigue has taken hold.
[1:12:34] Anybody
[1:12:37] ever felt repentance fatigue before?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know if you've heard
[1:12:41] that as a phrase before, but it's a
[1:12:44] thing.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:12:48] you know,
[1:12:49] Lord, we can do this again. I can come.
[1:12:52] I can be at the altar. I can repent and
[1:12:56] I CAN BE SINCERE AND I CAN MEAN IT,
[1:12:58] LORD.
[1:13:00] But we all know what's going to happen.
[1:13:04] Sorry. Is this a little too real? Is
[1:13:06] this like
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Was I Everybody's like, "How does
[1:13:10] he know me?"
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; How do we WHAT IS SHE WANTS
[1:13:17] RIGHTEOUSNESS. SHE WANTS TO DO THIS. WE
[1:13:20] WANT TO STOP SAYING WE WANT TO STOP
[1:13:22] THANKING GOD FOR WHAT PAUL SAID. OH,
[1:13:24] WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM. LIKE, LORD,
[1:13:26] thank you for a I wanted THAT FOR A
[1:13:28] SEASON, BUT NOW I DON'T WANT TO THANK
[1:13:30] YOU THAT PAUL SAID THAT AGAIN. like I I
[1:13:33] want to be over that phase in my life. I
[1:13:35] want to step into a new era of my life
[1:13:39] that's not that
[1:13:42] I want to be righteous.
[1:13:45] Okay, praise the Lord. How do we become
[1:13:47] righteous?
[1:13:49] Well, I mean that's obvious. Stop
[1:13:52] sinning.
[1:13:56] Hello
[1:14:05] I be I began TO TELL HER, YOU KNOW,
[1:14:08] SISTER, it just seemed, you know, from
[1:14:09] what I could just knew of her life and
[1:14:12] what I could understand, I just felt
[1:14:13] like she is now she had now become and I
[1:14:16] misjudged her age by a few years, but I
[1:14:18] was essentially right that, you know,
[1:14:21] when you're, you know, when you're,
[1:14:24] you know, she talked about when she was
[1:14:25] younger, you know, SHE JUST LOVED GOD
[1:14:27] and just wanted to serve him and
[1:14:28] everything was just so simple and so
[1:14:30] easy and oh it was nice and YOU KNOW BUT
[1:14:32] NOW I struggle it's like hello you this
[1:14:36] is ex this is this is normal life
[1:14:39] because now you're coming you know now
[1:14:41] the hormones are happening in your life
[1:14:42] and your brain is getting bigger and you
[1:14:44] know all of these things now you've got
[1:14:46] all these chemical things going on and
[1:14:48] you know your amydala is fully formed
[1:14:50] which you can you so NOW YOU HAVE FULL
[1:14:52] RANGE OF emotions and the prefrontal
[1:14:55] cortex hasn't DEVELOPED UNTIL YOU'RE 25
[1:14:58] SO YOU'VE GOT AND I'M JUST LIKE THERE'S
[1:15:00] got to be a sermon in here. I just don't
[1:15:01] know what it is. LIKE LORD, WHY DID YOU
[1:15:03] DESIGN US LIKE THIS TO HAVE A FULL range
[1:15:04] of emotions at like 16, BUT UNTIL 25 TO
[1:15:09] HAVE THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX to like
[1:15:10] control those emotions
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; and be able to make decisions?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's like I don't know. I don't know
[1:15:19] why, but the Lord made us that way
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; and we all go through these times.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And so some of that's natural.
[1:15:28] And and so we're now we're we're we're
[1:15:30] fighting fighting against our own our
[1:15:33] own emotions and our own problems and
[1:15:34] all of these things that are going on
[1:15:35] and and things are now things are
[1:15:37] there's desires that are coming into our
[1:15:39] lives that we you know we never we never
[1:15:42] had before cuz it used to be the boys
[1:15:44] had cooties and now you looked and
[1:15:46] you're like we hi
[1:15:50] and like it used to be EASY AND NOW IT'S
[1:15:52] hard
[1:15:54] and all of these kinds of things begin
[1:15:56] to happen you know sister, some of this
[1:15:58] is that, YOU KNOW, GIVE YOURSELF a
[1:16:00] little bit of grace. You know, these
[1:16:02] these things these things are happening.
[1:16:04] You've got to, yes, there's a there's
[1:16:05] some responsibility there that we should
[1:16:08] get to a place where we control some of
[1:16:10] these things and we put up the correct
[1:16:12] safeguards and that sort of thing, but
[1:16:15] you know, BUT BUT BUT GIVE YOURSELF SOME
[1:16:17] GRACE. You know, you're the these things
[1:16:19] happen, you know, and but more than
[1:16:21] that, you know, I just wanted to discuss
[1:16:23] that as a concept because again, that's
[1:16:24] a terrible answer. It's like, "Oh,
[1:16:26] you're struggling with some sin." That's
[1:16:28] totally normal. Teenagers struggle with
[1:16:31] sin. It's okay.
[1:16:36] That's maybe not the answer.
[1:16:39] So, but we're coming to something, you
[1:16:41] know. So, I said,
[1:16:45] but what I recognized is I recognized
[1:16:48] that there wasn't hope there and there
[1:16:50] was a lot of fear there. I'm scared. SHE
[1:16:52] SAYS THAT GOD PUNISHES ME. Why are you
[1:16:57] scared that God punishes you?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Is that truth or is that a lie? And so
[1:17:05] recognizing this, I thought, "OH, I'VE
[1:17:08] GOT SOMETHING TO SEND HER." YOU'RE
[1:17:09] probably very familiar with this quote,
[1:17:11] but in the MESSAGE BLIND BARNAMEUS, "GOD
[1:17:13] WILL NEVER JUDGE YOU FOR being a sinner.
[1:17:16] He can't judge you because you He can't
[1:17:19] judge you because sin was paid for at
[1:17:22] Calvary. And you're a not a sinner,
[1:17:24] you're a rejector. See, he judges you
[1:17:27] for rejecting salvation when it's been
[1:17:28] offered to you. BUT JESUS, JOHN, WHEN HE
[1:17:31] SAW HIM, HE SAID, "BEHOLD, the lamb of
[1:17:34] God that takes away the sin of the
[1:17:38] world." And all sin question was settled
[1:17:43] at Calvary.
[1:17:47] So, so explain to So I told her, I said,
[1:17:50] "Look, sister, I want you to read this
[1:17:52] quote every day for two weeks, not
[1:17:56] because it's some kind of mantra or some
[1:17:58] kind of, you know, work yourself into
[1:18:00] THIS QUOTE." AND NO, BECAUSE I I SHE SHE
[1:18:03] IS SO SHE WAS SO FAR FROM removed from
[1:18:06] the truth of this quote that I needed
[1:18:09] HER TO TO ESTABLISH HERSELF IN THIS word
[1:18:13] in this truth because she could never
[1:18:16] move on UNTIL SHE RECOGNIZED THAT GOD
[1:18:20] WAS HE MAD AT HER FOR her sin? WELL, HE
[1:18:22] ALREADY KNEW ABOUT it before THE
[1:18:24] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD and had ALREADY
[1:18:26] PREDETERMINED THAT HE WOULD COME IN THE
[1:18:29] FORM OF JESUS CHRIST AND THAT JOHN COULD
[1:18:31] SAY, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES
[1:18:35] AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD." THAT MEANS
[1:18:39] ALL THE SIN. AND SO GOD CAN NO LONGER BE
[1:18:43] MAD AND WANT TO PUNISH YOU BECAUSE ALL
[1:18:47] PUNISHMENT FOR SIN HAS ALREADY BEEN
[1:18:50] POURED OUT on one man.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; So you CANNOT BE SCARED OF GOD PUNISHING
[1:18:58] YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NO PUNISHMENT LEFT
[1:19:01] FROM GOD TO POUR OUT. AND WE DON'T HAVE
[1:19:05] TO FEEL SORRY FOR JESUS AND SAY, "WELL,
[1:19:07] YOU TOOK YOU TOOK SO MUCH PUNISHMENT."
[1:19:10] YOU KNOW, I REALLY SHOULD TAKE SOME OF
[1:19:12] THAT BACK.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Last I checked, WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO
[1:19:21] BE CATHOLIC.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW, WE
[1:19:26] DIDN'T BELIEVE IN PENANCE. WE BELIEVED
[1:19:29] IN THE COMPLETE ATONEMENT OF THE OF THE
[1:19:32] DEATH OF JESUS CHRIST AT CALVARY.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAYS, "I I JUST GET ANGRY at
[1:19:40] myself,
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; You know what that is?
[1:19:51] It's a It's mental penance."
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; We message believers are really good at
[1:19:55] that one. You see, cuz nobody sees us,
[1:19:58] right? Nobody sees us walk on our knees
[1:20:01] with our beads up the steps to touch the
[1:20:04] feet of the statue. Nobody sees us DO
[1:20:07] THAT. OH MY. BUT oh man, does But
[1:20:11] doesn't it feel good, man? Doesn't it
[1:20:13] feel good to beat yourself up a little
[1:20:15] bit inside to atone just a little bit?
[1:20:19] Doesn't it just make you feel better?
[1:20:21] God, if I can just atone myself by just
[1:20:24] being mad at myself,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; even though you've already TAKEN ALL OF
[1:20:28] MY PUNISHMENT, BUT GOD, IT DOESN'T FEEL
[1:20:31] GOOD TO JUST, I don't know, bathe
[1:20:34] completely in the GRACE OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:20:37] AND THE COMPLETE finished atonement that
[1:20:40] you have wrought for me SO EFFECTUALLY
[1:20:42] ON CALVARY. LORD, THAT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD
[1:20:44] TO ME.
[1:20:51] OUCH. That one was
[1:20:55] wow. So,
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; so maybe we should READ THIS QUOTE ONCE
[1:21:00] A DAY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO BE
[1:21:02] GROUNDED THAT THE LAMB OF GOD HAS TAKEN
[1:21:06] AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. THE PRICE HAS
[1:21:08] BEEN PAID. THAT THE THE FATHER ISN'T
[1:21:11] SITTING THERE IN JUDGMENT ANY LONGER
[1:21:13] LOOKING DOWN ON US AND SO I I'm going to
[1:21:17] don't you dare mess up again
[1:21:21] if you do
[1:21:23] you and I are going to have
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:30] praise the Lord
[1:21:35] so I sent this to her and I told her
[1:21:37] read Romans 5 all the way to Romans 8,
[1:21:41] you know, and because what we're finding
[1:21:43] here is what we'll what we'll see is
[1:21:46] that Romans 7 is a transitional is a
[1:21:49] transitional chapter where because Paul
[1:21:52] has been speaking of grace. You know, we
[1:21:54] he started in Romans and in with with
[1:21:56] chapter 1 and talking about they they
[1:21:58] forgot God and and all of these bad
[1:22:00] things began to happen and all the way
[1:22:02] down to 2026 like problems. they men
[1:22:06] working meant with men that which is
[1:22:08] unseammly and all of these all of these
[1:22:10] issues. What? Why? Because they forgot
[1:22:12] God. AND THEN AND THEN PAUL BEGINS TO
[1:22:14] build grace in there. He begins to turn
[1:22:17] and talk ABOUT GRACE. AND YOU'LL HAVE
[1:22:19] SUCH VERSES such as, you know, the wages
[1:22:21] of sin as death, but the gift of God I
[1:22:24] is is life in in Christ Jesus our Lord,
[1:22:27] which I totally butchered that one. Did
[1:22:28] you understand like Romans 6:23 and
[1:22:30] Romans 3:23 and you know BUT BUT ROMANS
[1:22:33] 5 SHALL WE CONTINUE IN SIN THAT GRACE
[1:22:35] MAY ABOUND? GOD FORBID HOW SHALL WE who
[1:22:37] are dead TO SIN LIVE ANY LONGER THEREIN?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; So he's he's dealing with the concepts
[1:22:43] OF GRACE AND HE COMES TO CHAPTER 7 AND
[1:22:45] HE BEGINS TO WELL WE'RE under grace.
[1:22:48] We're living under grace, BUT WE'RE
[1:22:50] STILL STRUGGLING. BUT GRACE HASN'T
[1:22:52] TAKEN. BUT HAS GRACE MADE US RIGHTEOUS
[1:22:55] WHERE WE'RE STILL BEING PULLED DOWN
[1:22:57] THESE THINGS? AND SO HE'LL TRANSITION US
[1:22:59] THEN INTO THE SPIRITFILLED LIFE SO THAT
[1:23:02] we'll live and walk in the newness of
[1:23:04] the spirit.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; But the body
[1:23:10] is still the temple of that spirit.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; It is not that spirit.
[1:23:18] And so I sent her, you know, some of
[1:23:20] these kinds of thoughts. And so, so she
[1:23:23] said, "It helped me a lot. I was worried
[1:23:26] because I felt like I would throw the
[1:23:28] grace of God away by sinning again and
[1:23:30] again, but I really need God's help and
[1:23:32] the strength to resist the desires of
[1:23:34] the flesh. You are right. Looking back,
[1:23:36] things seemed easier and nicer. But
[1:23:37] growing and becoming more mature, I
[1:23:39] started seeing and realizing things are
[1:23:41] different as they used to be, or that it
[1:23:43] gets more complicated. And now I'm 19
[1:23:44] years old. I just wish I would be the
[1:23:46] same Christian girl I was about three
[1:23:48] years ago. I think that's a pretty
[1:23:51] interesting line
[1:23:53] because what I would say is sister, you
[1:23:55] still are.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; The fact that you would reach out to a
[1:23:59] brother and ask for help on this issue
[1:24:02] indicates you are the same Christian
[1:24:05] girl you always were.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; That has not changed.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I just want to be the same girl again.
[1:24:14] that was close to the Lord and so
[1:24:16] innocent. I am mad at myself and
[1:24:18] sometimes I look in the mirror and speak
[1:24:21] bad at myself. I just think the Lord has
[1:24:24] to be up so upset at me and I feel a
[1:24:27] little lost
[1:24:30] again.
[1:24:32] Speaking bad at yourself in the mirror.
[1:24:34] What scripture is that?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Your personal penance there. Any I mean
[1:24:41] how many people look in the mirror and
[1:24:42] you you
[1:24:44] stupid.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; That's not scriptural.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm not worthy of reading
[1:24:54] the Bible and praying. It's just hard to
[1:24:56] get back to God after sinning. And I
[1:24:58] really don't want to fall again. I'm
[1:25:00] also scared that God will punish me.
[1:25:02] I'll pray and I would appreciate if you
[1:25:03] could pray also pray for me. God bless.
[1:25:06] Now, before I forget, because we'll get
[1:25:08] to the end of the sermon and I won't
[1:25:09] wrap this up. Um when I reached out to
[1:25:12] her again and said, "Sister, I just want
[1:25:14] you to know like I just felt inspired to
[1:25:16] use this. I hope that was okay. I would
[1:25:18] like to be able to continue this. I
[1:25:20] think it was a blessing for so many."
[1:25:22] And uh and I wanted to know how she was.
[1:25:24] I reached out to her. How you doing?
[1:25:25] How's this particular thing going for
[1:25:28] you? And she said, "Well, Brother
[1:25:29] Trevor, you've just written me on my
[1:25:32] wedding day." And I just I just that was
[1:25:35] beautiful, you know. So she's married
[1:25:37] and she's happy and you know still still
[1:25:40] serving the Lord. And she was so happy.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; She was so happy to know that her
[1:25:47] struggle and this note could be a
[1:25:51] blessing to other people and maybe
[1:25:53] somewhere in that
[1:25:55] there was some purpose in it
[1:25:58] that God can even take her problems and
[1:26:01] turn them into blessings.
[1:26:09] Okay.
[1:26:12] So,
[1:26:14] lie number one that I found out of this.
[1:26:17] My sin is probably greater than Jesus
[1:26:20] can forgive because I've known better
[1:26:22] than to do this for years.
[1:26:27] Anybody ever think that I can't be
[1:26:30] forgiven? I knew better and I did it
[1:26:33] anyway.
[1:26:34] See, that's that that that means that
[1:26:36] this is unpardonable sin. It No,
[1:26:40] no. That means I hate this thing. I know
[1:26:43] better than to do this thing. I
[1:26:44] shouldn't do this thing. Why am I doing
[1:26:46] this thing? Oh, wretched man that I am.
[1:26:49] That just means you're the Apostle Paul
[1:26:53] or similar to him. Which last time I
[1:26:55] checked, if I would have if I would have
[1:26:57] just said, "How many really wish you
[1:26:58] were just like the Apostle Paul?" You
[1:27:00] ought to have been like, "Man, that'd be
[1:27:01] an upgrade.
[1:27:06] And now we're like, man, wish that would
[1:27:08] have been an upgrade.
[1:27:11] Even after my first sin, I repented,
[1:27:12] TOLD GOD I WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN. THEN I
[1:27:14] FELL INTO it again. I obviously don't
[1:27:16] have God in me. You know, isn't it just
[1:27:20] like the devil to do these kinds of
[1:27:21] things, to say these kinds of things to
[1:27:24] you, to try to tell you, you know, one
[1:27:26] and done or 50 and done or a hundred and
[1:27:28] done or a thousand and done or a
[1:27:31] thousand and one for sure and it's over,
[1:27:34] man. I mean, there's just there's
[1:27:35] limits, right? I mean, you can only sin
[1:27:38] so many times the same thing before it's
[1:27:41] just you're just it's over. Well, it
[1:27:43] just depends. Have you rejected God?
[1:27:46] Like, have you rejected his grace?
[1:27:49] Because that's that's the issue. Have
[1:27:51] you rejected his grace or haven't you?
[1:27:52] And because he's given it to you. He's
[1:27:56] given it to you. And if the devil want
[1:27:57] if the devil can get you to say, "Well,
[1:27:59] hey, if you you know what I want you to
[1:28:01] do, Paul, I want you to keep a chart and
[1:28:02] I want you to keep a tally." And if you
[1:28:05] happen to get to more than falling more
[1:28:08] than 365 times in any given year, I you
[1:28:11] should really what you should really you
[1:28:13] should really consider that you're just
[1:28:15] not a Christian. that it's over for you
[1:28:17] and the grace of God can't help you.
[1:28:21] And if you believed that lie and
[1:28:23] rejected God's grace, that that would be
[1:28:25] problematic, far more problematic than
[1:28:28] falling into something that was pulling
[1:28:30] you, some addiction that you were
[1:28:32] struggling with 365 times in a given
[1:28:35] year.
[1:28:38] Again, it's a sermon about feeling
[1:28:40] better about your sin.
[1:28:46] which you all know is sarcasm for those
[1:28:49] that maybe don't know me so well. SO
[1:28:51] WHAT'S THE ANSWER? BROTHER TREVOR, I
[1:28:53] FALL. I LIKE I YOU SAID, "HEY, I'M
[1:28:55] REALLY HOPING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE
[1:28:57] us some hope and not just comfort about
[1:28:59] feeling good about our sin. Seems like
[1:29:01] if you if we leave right now, we'd be
[1:29:04] sitting here going, "What in the world
[1:29:05] was he tr how? What?" I love that part
[1:29:08] about Jesus Christ and the grace, but I
[1:29:10] don't it's just I'm not better. I'm not
[1:29:14] more righteous than when I came in the
[1:29:16] doors. And so what what gives brother
[1:29:18] Samuel? I don't know if we should have
[1:29:19] him again.
[1:29:22] Brother Tor, what is the answer? HOW
[1:29:24] LIKE I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS ADDICTION
[1:29:26] TO CHOCOLATE and I just, you know, I
[1:29:28] just I've PUT IT IN A BOX AND I PUT IT
[1:29:30] UNDER A lock and key and you know and I
[1:29:33] and then I went and got a hammer.
[1:29:41] I just needed that chocolate. And that
[1:29:43] chocolate can be whatever. I don't know
[1:29:44] what it is for you. Maybe it's actual
[1:29:46] chocolate. Maybe it's I DON'T KNOW,
[1:29:49] RIGHT? WE HAVE all kinds of things and
[1:29:50] WE'VE STRUGGLED AND WE TAKE INSTAGRAM
[1:29:52] breaks and you know, I think he just
[1:29:54] did. No, I'm not talking about you, you
[1:29:56] know, but just, you know, like like and
[1:29:58] we you know, it's like we put things
[1:29:59] UNDER LOCK AND KEY, YOU KNOW, WE SMASH
[1:30:01] OUR PHONE and all you did was made a
[1:30:03] thousand dollar mistake.
[1:30:06] You know, we had we had one brother that
[1:30:08] we used to laugh about. You know what we
[1:30:10] need to do is we need to have our DVD
[1:30:11] rental service. And this was back in the
[1:30:13] days of DVDs, you know, is because the
[1:30:15] brother, you know, he would he would
[1:30:17] repent and come back to God. He'd throw
[1:30:19] away all of his DVDs. AND THEN SIX
[1:30:21] MONTHS LATER,
[1:30:22] you know, it's like, well, that would I
[1:30:24] mean, and he'd go he'd GO AND HE'D BUY
[1:30:26] ALL THE same DVDs all over again. I
[1:30:28] thought, I can monetize this.
[1:30:32] Like, bro, is just like, hey, I'll just
[1:30:34] CHARGE YOU HALF PRICE EACH TIME. AND
[1:30:36] THEN, you know,
[1:30:39] this, you know, if you're going to do
[1:30:40] this anyway, I might as well profit.
[1:30:44] Somehow that didn't seem right, so we
[1:30:46] never did that. But, you know,
[1:30:51] what's the answer, Brother Trevor? How
[1:30:53] do we get over these addictions? How do
[1:30:55] we get over these things that pull us?
[1:30:58] We're trying to die daily. We want to
[1:31:01] have this righteousness. We want to find
[1:31:03] ourselves less less and less and less
[1:31:05] and less and and not not struggling any
[1:31:08] man. So what the answer is is to law
[1:31:11] better. Of course
[1:31:14] you know you know how to law better. You
[1:31:16] know IT'S LIKE THIS TIME Lord I'm never
[1:31:18] going to do it again. This this No, but
[1:31:21] this time I am serious. This time I'm
[1:31:24] going to read my Bible every morning.
[1:31:26] I'm going to pray more. I'm going to do
[1:31:28] all the right things. I'm really I'm
[1:31:30] just gonna dig in. And this this time,
[1:31:34] not like those five or 10 or 30 other
[1:31:37] times where I said exactly THE SAME
[1:31:39] THINGS, BUT THIS TIME I'M really going
[1:31:41] to do it better because I'm Oh, I'm mad
[1:31:44] at myself.
[1:31:47] And I am I mean, what else am I going to
[1:31:51] do? I've got to do something. I can't
[1:31:53] just I can't just give up.
[1:32:03] But it's never worked.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Why has it never worked?
[1:32:08] Anyway, let's read a little bit more of
[1:32:09] Romans 7. We'll go back to to verse one.
[1:32:16] And Paul says, "Know ye not, brethren,
[1:32:18] for I speak to them that know the law,
[1:32:20] how the law hath dominion over a man as
[1:32:22] long as he liveth. For the woman which
[1:32:24] hath an husband is bound by the law to
[1:32:26] her husband so long as he liveth. But if
[1:32:29] the husband be dead, she is loosed from
[1:32:30] the law of her husband. So then, if
[1:32:33] while her husband liveth, she be married
[1:32:34] to another man, she should be called an
[1:32:36] adulteress. But if her husband be dead,
[1:32:38] she is free from that law, so that she
[1:32:40] is no adulteress, though she be married
[1:32:43] to another man. And isn't this an
[1:32:45] interesting passage on the wait, what
[1:32:50] are we? This is just suddenly we got
[1:32:52] marriage and divorce and it's it's
[1:32:54] really nice of Paul to just stop for
[1:32:56] just he's like grace and then there's
[1:32:58] this part that we just read but just
[1:33:00] sandwiched in here there's a little
[1:33:02] marriage and it's like oh yeah I forgot
[1:33:03] to tell you like hey if a woman is
[1:33:05] married she's bound you know and she
[1:33:07] can't be married and you know but if he
[1:33:09] dies she can be married to another one
[1:33:10] and okay just wanted you all to know
[1:33:12] that because in 2026 you know they're
[1:33:14] going to take these verses and some of
[1:33:15] the things that Jesus said and they're
[1:33:16] going to take the message marriage and
[1:33:17] divorce and they're going to put them in
[1:33:18] a folder and when they need to talk
[1:33:20] about marriage divorce issues. They've
[1:33:21] got everything here so we can reference
[1:33:22] it. And so that's what we do now with
[1:33:24] these verses. And it has nothing to do
[1:33:27] with the continuity of what Paul is
[1:33:29] talking about through Romans
[1:33:33] or wait that seems awkward now that I
[1:33:37] just said it doesn't seem like maybe
[1:33:39] that's right. But this is how we treat
[1:33:41] these scriptures. We think of them as
[1:33:43] marriage and divorce scriptures and we
[1:33:45] catalog them in marriage and divorce.
[1:33:46] But if we take the continuity of what
[1:33:48] Paul is talking about and going through
[1:33:50] grace, what is he talking about?
[1:33:51] Wherefore, my brethren, ye are also
[1:33:55] become dead to the law. So Paul has set
[1:33:57] up the marriage and divorce law that
[1:33:59] everyone is familiar with and now
[1:34:01] applying it spiritually. Wherefore, my
[1:34:03] brethren, you're also become dead to the
[1:34:06] law by the body of Christ, that ye
[1:34:09] should be married to another, even to
[1:34:12] him who is raised from the dead, that we
[1:34:14] should bring forth fruit unto God. For
[1:34:18] when we were in the flesh, the motions
[1:34:21] of sin, which were by the law, did work
[1:34:24] in our members to bring forth fruit unto
[1:34:28] death.
[1:34:30] But now we are delivered from the law.
[1:34:33] That being dead where we were held, we
[1:34:36] should serve in newness of spirit
[1:34:40] and not in the oldness of the letter.
[1:34:43] The answer is not to law better
[1:34:46] because BECAUSE THE LAW THE FRUIT of the
[1:34:49] law brought forth death. It never
[1:34:51] brought forth any life. When we were
[1:34:53] married to the law, the only THING IT
[1:34:55] COULD DO IS BRING FORTH DEATH. BUT JESUS
[1:34:58] PUT THAT TO DEATH BY THE CROSS AND WAS
[1:35:01] RAISED IN NEWNESS OF LIFE. AND NOW WE
[1:35:04] HAVE A NEW HUSBAND. NO LONGER BOUND TO
[1:35:06] THAT HUSBAND AND HAVE NOW COME AND ARE
[1:35:09] REM ARE NOW MARRIED TO JESUS CHRIST WHO
[1:35:12] IS RISEN IN his grace
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW MAN. AND SO
[1:35:20] OFTEN NOW LET'S REPLAY WITH THIS IDEA
[1:35:23] HERE. NOW LET'S REPLAY THE IDEA. GOD, I
[1:35:26] KNOW I HATE THIS THING. I shouldn't do
[1:35:28] this. And I'm GOING DOWN AVENUES AND
[1:35:31] BREAKING MY BOX TO GET TO MY CHOCOLATE
[1:35:33] EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I SHOULDN'T.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; And I FIND MYSELF AND I WAKE UP AND I
[1:35:39] COME BACK TO MYSELF AND I GO, "WHAT AM I
[1:35:42] DOING? I FEEL SUCH LIKE SUCH A LOSER. I
[1:35:45] SHOULD I SHOULD I'M GOING TO GO REPENT
[1:35:48] AGAIN. I'm going to, YOU KNOW, DO ALL OF
[1:35:49] THE THINGS THAT I WOULD DO, YOU KNOW,
[1:35:51] BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DO. That's
[1:35:53] that's what the law tells us to do." Of
[1:35:55] course, you know, if you've sinned, you
[1:35:57] come and repent. And so, what do we do?
[1:35:59] We come, we we maybe we wait for a
[1:36:01] service or that's really, really good.
[1:36:03] AND WE COME TO THE ALTAR and we pray.
[1:36:05] AND I'VE JUST GOT ONE question for you.
[1:36:08] With the things that you were dealing
[1:36:09] with in your life, how long do you need
[1:36:11] to be at the altar to really get
[1:36:14] forgiveness?
[1:36:16] What's that? Not that long. You haven't
[1:36:18] been really struggling lately, have you?
[1:36:21] Yeah. So, Matthew, it's Matthew, right?
[1:36:23] Matthew, the things that you've been
[1:36:24] dealing with. How long do you need to be
[1:36:26] at the altar?
[1:36:28] You know,
[1:36:31] couldn't be long enough, right? Can you
[1:36:34] do you want to maybe tally some things
[1:36:35] up that you know you're struggling with?
[1:36:38] You know, you've got a nice piece of
[1:36:39] paper here. Nobody has to see the
[1:36:41] camera's not just don't camera on the
[1:36:44] you know, you could just tally the
[1:36:45] things and then maybe just write beside
[1:36:46] it how many minutes you feel like you
[1:36:48] should pray at the altar for. Anybody
[1:36:52] ever do that? How long is long enough?
[1:36:54] Brother Matthew says, I I mean,
[1:36:56] actually, I don't think if we're going
[1:36:56] to tally minutes, I don't think there's
[1:36:58] enough minutes.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; We'll pray for him.
[1:37:05] What's I mean, but what's the what's the
[1:37:07] what's the answer? HOW LONG SHOULD WE BE
[1:37:09] AT the altar? You know, like I mean,
[1:37:10] it's like, well, this was a really bad
[1:37:12] one. And and for God to know that I was
[1:37:14] really sincere about repenting, that's a
[1:37:16] 30 minute deal.
[1:37:19] if I don't do 30 minutes, like I I mean,
[1:37:22] I don't know how God would know. I don't
[1:37:23] even know if I'm sincere at 30 minutes.
[1:37:25] So, I don't know how God would know
[1:37:27] because God doesn't know everything, you
[1:37:28] know? Wait, that wasn't true. But I
[1:37:33] think that in the moment, and I struggle
[1:37:35] with these things and now, and all
[1:37:38] you're DOING IS GOING BACK TO YOUR FIRST
[1:37:40] HUSBAND. ALL YOU'RE DOING IS GOING BACK
[1:37:42] TO SOME AND HONESTLY, IT'S NOT EVEN it's
[1:37:45] like that's not even first husband.
[1:37:46] That's like some kind of tradition that
[1:37:48] you've baked up in your mind about how
[1:37:50] long you're supposed to be at the altar
[1:37:52] to actually have adequate repentance for
[1:37:54] whatever stupid thing it is you just
[1:37:56] did.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "But brother Trevor, like what
[1:38:00] are you saying? Like are are you saying
[1:38:04] that if you fall into something you can
[1:38:07] pick you can recognize that you you you
[1:38:10] just you you are you saying brother
[1:38:11] Trevor when you you walked down that
[1:38:13] avenue that you knew you shouldn't have
[1:38:15] walked down and that you came to
[1:38:17] yourself and you thought I am such a
[1:38:19] loser that you could look up and say
[1:38:21] thank you Lord Jesus for your grace I
[1:38:24] know by what you have already done I am
[1:38:26] forgiven and you feel like you could be
[1:38:28] forgiven in that moment
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; is That would is are you are you are you
[1:38:33] for real, brother Trevor? Are you really
[1:38:35] really because that just doesn't seem
[1:38:37] right. That doesn't seem LIKE LIKE THE
[1:38:39] PRICE HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR YOU LIKE
[1:38:42] THAT THAT ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THAT
[1:38:44] YOU WOULD ACCEPT THAT THAT OLD HUSBAND
[1:38:46] IS DEAD. AND WE TRY TO BE MARRIED TO
[1:38:49] BOTH AND IT DOESN'T WORK. AND WE FIND
[1:38:51] OURSELVES PULLED BACK AND FORTH AND BACK
[1:38:54] AND FORTH AND NEVER REALLY BRINGING ANY
[1:38:56] FOR ANY FRUITS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS. BUT
[1:38:59] SITTING THERE TORN BETWEEN BOTH
[1:39:01] HUSBANDS, NEVER REALLY ACCEPTING THAT
[1:39:03] THIS OLD HUSBAND HAS BEEN PUT TO DEATH
[1:39:06] AND THAT WE CAN NOW SERVE HIM IN THE
[1:39:08] NEWNESS OF SPIRIT. AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN
[1:39:11] THAT PATH TO SIT THERE AND BEAT YOURSELF
[1:39:13] UP FOR TWO WEEKS, PUT YOURSELF IN THE
[1:39:16] DOGHOUSE, SPEAK BAD AT YOURSELF IN THE
[1:39:18] MIRROR,
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; and repent for whatever amount of time
[1:39:24] you think is legitimate.
[1:39:28] ALL YOU'VE DONE IS WASTED TIME TRYING TO
[1:39:32] DO YOUR OWN WORKS OF ATONEMENT WHEN HE
[1:39:35] HAS ALREADY ATONED FOR IT FULLY. YES,
[1:39:38] SIR.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; AND ALL IT TAKES IS TO REC RECOGNIZE
[1:39:42] GOD, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT. YES, SIR.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; HERE I AM BEING JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE
[1:39:48] PAUL AGAIN. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
[1:39:57] RIGHT. SO, brother Trevor,
[1:40:01] are you saying like what you're saying
[1:40:03] here? It just seems it seems to me what
[1:40:05] you're saying is is that it's not true
[1:40:08] that I'm a special kind of loser of a
[1:40:11] sinner
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I WAS, YOU
[1:40:16] KNOW, THAT I WAS A WORSE SINNER THAN
[1:40:17] MOST EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS CHURCH. WELL,
[1:40:20] EXCEPTING SO- AND SO. BUT I MEAN, let's
[1:40:22] all be real.
[1:40:26] But seriously, WOULDN'T THE DEVIL
[1:40:28] DOESN'T THE DEVIL WANT TO DO THAT TO
[1:40:30] YOU? ISN'T THAT WHERE YOUR MIND so often
[1:40:32] goes? No one has my problems. NO ONE'S
[1:40:35] AS MUCH OF A THEY'RE ALL BETTER than I
[1:40:37] am. I AM A SPECIAL KIND OF LOSER.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I'VE BEEN SAYING
[1:40:42] JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL. BECAUSE NOW
[1:40:46] IF THAT GETS IF THAT GETS EMBEDDED INTO
[1:40:49] YOUR MIND WHEN THE DEVIL COMES TO SAY
[1:40:51] you you're such a loser of a SINNER YOU
[1:40:53] CAN SAY YEAH ME AND PAUL
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; WHO I REMIND YOU DEVIL WAS ONE OF THE
[1:41:01] SEVEN ANGELS THAT THE ONE OF THE SEVEN
[1:41:04] STARS IN THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD. IF YOU
[1:41:06] WANT TO COMPARE ME TO THE APOSTLE PAUL
[1:41:08] GO AHEAD.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; I'M GOOD WITH THAT COMPARISON DEVIL. GO
[1:41:13] AHEAD. KEEP COMPARING ME to him
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; because IF I'M A SPECIAL KIND OF SINNER
[1:41:17] MERELY BECAUSE I DID SOMETHING THAT I
[1:41:20] KNOW BETTER AND THAT I ABSOLUTELY HATE
[1:41:23] IN MY LIFE BUT I STILL DID IT THAT JUST
[1:41:26] MEANS I'M LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; AND GOOD GOOD TRY DEVIL TRYING TO GET ME
[1:41:32] TO BEAT MYSELF UP AND ATONE FOR MY OWN
[1:41:36] SINS WHEN I KNOW SOMEONE HAS ALREADY
[1:41:39] DONE IT SOMEONE HAS BEEN BEATEN SOMEONE
[1:41:41] HAS BEEN BRUISED SOMEONE'S BEARD BEARD
[1:41:43] WAS PLUCKED OUT. SOMEONE HAD SPIT IN HIS
[1:41:46] FACE.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; SOMEONE HAD STRIPES AND BREATHED HIS
[1:41:49] LAST BREATH SAYING IT IS FINISHED.
[1:41:53] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; SO, DEVIL, JUST LIKE THE APOSTLE PAUL,
[1:42:00] WHEN I COME TO MYSELF, I SAY, "OH,
[1:42:03] WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM, BUT RIGHT AFTER
[1:42:06] THAT, I WILL RECOGNIZE
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; THAT JESUS IN THE FORM OF FLESH, for
[1:42:15] sinful flesh,
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; put sin to death
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; in the flesh,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; which is Romans 8:3. Yes sir.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; And recognize devil, you would like to
[1:42:27] attach me to my first husband, but that
[1:42:30] first husband died at Calvary.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; And so now, devil, I am not going to
[1:42:37] waste my time
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; with any kind of self-penance.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Because I, you know, I've I've preached
[1:42:46] a number of youth camps now in my life.
[1:42:48] I've had enough I mean I can't how many
[1:42:50] hundreds of youth have come forward in
[1:42:52] prayer lines prayer line after prayer
[1:42:54] line and you begin to deal with them and
[1:42:57] it's like hey man like
[1:43:01] brother Trevor I'm a dirty rotten sitter
[1:43:06] stinks to be you I mean not like me
[1:43:12] did you know I have a website
[1:43:14] messagene.com
[1:43:16] which means I I don't have problems like
[1:43:18] you have.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; NO,
[1:43:24] ME AND PAUL AND YOU. We're all together
[1:43:28] in this.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; But if we spend our if all we're DOING
[1:43:31] IS GOING TO SPEND OUR TIME BEATING
[1:43:33] OURSELVES UP AND NOT HAVING FAITH, WE'LL
[1:43:35] never get to the first base. WE'LL NEVER
[1:43:37] GET STARTED. I I I I've gone to young
[1:43:40] people I you know just literally like
[1:43:42] like I mean we're like we're like man
[1:43:44] it's like 11 p.m. Service ended TWO
[1:43:47] HOURS AGO. THIS YOUNG man is beating. I
[1:43:49] MEAN LITERALLY GOD.
[1:43:51] OH GOD.
[1:43:53] RIGHT.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; What a sincere guy. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:44:00] Yeah. What?
[1:44:05] Two more hours, bro.
[1:44:07] Two more hours. Keep it up. We'll be in
[1:44:10] the back.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Trevor, you should go lay hands
[1:44:15] on that brother and pray for Yeah, that
[1:44:16] was an hour ago.
[1:44:21] Is it works that he needs to do?
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Went to the young man. I said, "Brother,
[1:44:28] can I talk to you for a moment?"
[1:44:32] So, I think you've been here before. I
[1:44:34] think you've done all this before. I
[1:44:36] think this is the not not the first time
[1:44:37] you've been crying at an altar, beating
[1:44:39] literally beating the altar with your
[1:44:41] hand, crying out to God at what a wretch
[1:44:44] you are. This isn't the first time
[1:44:45] you've done that, is it? No, brother.
[1:44:48] No. And it's probably over the same
[1:44:49] thing in your life. Yeah, brother.
[1:44:53] Yeah. You know what? You're going to
[1:44:54] need to believe God.
[1:44:56] You're going to need to believe that he
[1:44:58] can forgive you. You're going to need to
[1:44:59] believe that he already did forgive you.
[1:45:01] You're going to need to be able to send.
[1:45:03] And I, you know, I I'm not I you know,
[1:45:05] I'm not just saying, "Hey, forget it.
[1:45:07] Stand up. Accept it. Go your way."
[1:45:08] Because, man, it's late.
[1:45:13] Sorry, that was too real.
[1:45:20] Oh, that's not what I'm talking about.
[1:45:22] But I'm talking about what you're doing
[1:45:23] right now is futile
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; and it will never change anything unless
[1:45:27] you couple that with faith in the word
[1:45:30] of God
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; to recognize that he has died for you.
[1:45:34] And until you can accept that in faith,
[1:45:37] all your beating on the altar is not
[1:45:38] doing it's we're wasting your time.
[1:45:41] Frankly, you're wasting my time. And
[1:45:44] there's pizza in the fellowship hall.
[1:45:46] Let's go.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding, you know.
[1:45:53] I'll stay late if we need to stay late.
[1:45:55] But man, like let's make it let's make
[1:45:58] it worthwhile.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; And faith to believe what God has
[1:46:03] already done is what this is about.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you'll never you'll never
[1:46:08] you'll you well you'll never go you'll
[1:46:10] never get started on your path to
[1:46:12] righteousness without faith.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans chapter 5 quickly.
[1:46:17] Just a few more scriptures before we
[1:46:19] finish up here. My timer says I'm done.
[1:46:21] But Romans chapter 4, WHAT SHALL WE SAY
[1:46:24] then that Abraham our father as
[1:46:27] pertaining to his flesh has found? For
[1:46:30] if Abraham were justified by works, he
[1:46:33] hath whereof to glory, but not before
[1:46:36] God. For what saith the scripture?
[1:46:37] Abraham believed God, and it was counted
[1:46:40] to him for
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; righteousness. Brother Trevor, I want to
[1:46:44] be righteous. I don't want to go down
[1:46:46] these things. Well, you know what?
[1:46:47] Abraham was righteous. Why? Because of
[1:46:49] faith. Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Righteousness begins in faith. And if
[1:46:55] you never start with faith, you can
[1:46:57] never start your journey to
[1:46:58] righteousness. You can ne IT DOES ALL OF
[1:47:00] THE ALL I DON'T CARE how many guard
[1:47:03] RAILS YOU PUT UP. I don't care HOW GOOD
[1:47:05] YOU ARE AT STAYING away from chocolate.
[1:47:08] YOU COULD LOCK THE CHOCOLATE UP AS AS
[1:47:11] HARD AS POSSIBLE, BUT UNTIL you have
[1:47:13] faith, all you're sitting all you're
[1:47:16] doing is you just want chocolate that's
[1:47:18] locked up.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:47:21] And you're no more RIGHTEOUS THAN YOU
[1:47:23] EVER WERE until you have faith that God
[1:47:26] forgave you in the first place.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; So Abraham ver continuing on in verse 18
[1:47:34] says it says WHO AGAINST HOPE. OH
[1:47:37] brother Trevor it seems hopeless. I am
[1:47:40] so hopelessly addicted to this
[1:47:42] chocolate. I have fallen to chocolate a
[1:47:46] h 100,000 times. There is no hope for
[1:47:49] me. Abraham who against hope
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; believed in hope.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; I read this scripture
[1:48:02] a few months ago.
[1:48:06] The sister caught hold of it.
[1:48:09] She hasn't been able to have a child
[1:48:12] and it seemed like it was hopeless for
[1:48:14] her.
[1:48:16] She's, I don't know, a few months
[1:48:17] pregnant today
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; because she recognized that she could
[1:48:22] believe in hope even though it seemed
[1:48:24] hopeless
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; that he might become the father of many
[1:48:27] nations. Hallelujah. According to that
[1:48:29] which was spoken, so shall thy seed be.
[1:48:31] Being not weak in faith, he considered
[1:48:33] not his own body now dead.
[1:48:37] when he was about a hundred years old,
[1:48:38] neither the deadness of Sarah's womb, he
[1:48:40] staggered not at promise of God through
[1:48:42] unbelief, but was strong in faith,
[1:48:43] giving glory to God, being fully
[1:48:45] persuaded that what he had promised, he
[1:48:48] was also able to perform. And therefore,
[1:48:51] it was imputed to him for righteousness.
[1:48:55] Brother, it's Trevor, I want to be
[1:48:57] righteous. You're going to need against
[1:48:59] hope, believe in hope. You think you're
[1:49:01] GOING TO GET PULLED DOWN THIS WAY AND
[1:49:03] PULLED DOWN THIS way and you've been
[1:49:05] addicted and it seems hopeless that
[1:49:06] you'll ever get away from this cycle of
[1:49:09] fall and rise and fall and rise
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; just like the Apostle Paul
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; but against hope seems hopeless but
[1:49:20] believe in hope
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; believe that God is able to perform it
[1:49:24] and let me tell you what Abraham at
[1:49:26] every brother Trevor like but brother
[1:49:28] Trevor you just don't realize like my
[1:49:30] I'm Just my flesh is
[1:49:34] my flesh is
[1:49:36] I mean my flesh is unbelievably strong
[1:49:38] in its desires as compared to anyone
[1:49:41] else in this church.
[1:49:45] My flesh is strong. You don't
[1:49:46] understand. Abraham could say, "My
[1:49:49] goodness, I'm wrinkled. I'm old. I walk
[1:49:53] around with a cane. I'm a hundred years
[1:49:56] old. My wife is 90.
[1:50:00] She's hunched over. Her hand is hands
[1:50:04] are wrinkled.
[1:50:06] She's not having a baby.
[1:50:10] As according to our flesh, this is
[1:50:13] impossible.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; And don't we feel like that some days?
[1:50:21] God,
[1:50:23] according to my flesh,
[1:50:25] to get over this problem that I struggle
[1:50:28] with in my life, it's impossible. I
[1:50:31] mean, you might as well just say I'm a
[1:50:32] hundred and I'm I mean, I feel like, you
[1:50:36] know, I mean, my knees hurt from all the
[1:50:38] times I've been kneeling at the altar.
[1:50:41] I've got hundredy old knees because I've
[1:50:43] repented so many times. Like, it just
[1:50:45] seems so awful.
[1:50:51] Did it matter to Abraham? No. Why?
[1:50:55] Because of faith. And that faith was
[1:50:57] counted to him for righteousness.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; So, I guess it depends on what do you
[1:51:01] mean by righteousness?
[1:51:03] Does righteousness mean I've stopped
[1:51:05] sinning?
[1:51:07] Or does righteousness mean? I believe
[1:51:11] that God is able to perform
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; in my life.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; What he's promised, HE CAN PERFORM NO
[1:51:21] MATTER THE WEAKNESS of the flesh.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; So go ahead and turn to Romans chapter 8
[1:51:27] and let's read the first few verses
[1:51:29] there.
[1:51:32] I don't have them on the slide.
[1:51:40] which says, "There's therefore now no
[1:51:42] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[1:51:44] Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
[1:51:48] after the spirit. For the law of the
[1:51:50] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[1:51:54] me free from the law of sin and death."
[1:51:56] Why? This is a call back to Romans 7:es
[1:51:59] 1 through3. I'M FREE FROM IT. WHY?
[1:52:02] BECAUSE HE PUT IT TO DEATH. I'M married
[1:52:04] to the spirit now. For what THE LAW
[1:52:07] COULD NOT DO in that it was weak through
[1:52:11] the flesh. GOD SENDING HIS OWN SON in
[1:52:14] the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:52:18] condemned sin in the flesh that the
[1:52:21] righteousness of the law might be
[1:52:24] fulfilled in us
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; but after the spirit.
[1:52:34] Brother Trevor, you didn't give us seven
[1:52:36] steps to be better. You didn't actually
[1:52:39] tell us how we can stop doing these
[1:52:41] things. You actually seem like you don't
[1:52:42] even It doesn't even seem like you care
[1:52:45] how bad at this thing I am.
[1:52:48] You're right.
[1:52:50] I don't.
[1:52:54] And when you can get to a spot to where
[1:52:56] you recognize the grace of God is so
[1:52:58] complete is so amazing.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Brother, BROTHER TREVOR, NO, YOU DON'T
[1:53:06] HAVE ANYTHING TO DO IN IT.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; The the lamb of God has taken away the
[1:53:10] sin of the world.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Let let's start there. LET'S BEGIN TO
[1:53:14] BELIEVE the word of GOD AND SAY, "GOD, I
[1:53:16] I FEEL LIKE SUCH A FAILURE. I I I JUST
[1:53:19] BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. IT'S
[1:53:21] ABOUT TRUTH. WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE
[1:53:24] FOR YOU. CAN you believe that tonight?
[1:53:27] CAN YOU ACCEPT THAT FOR YOURSELF? NOT
[1:53:29] NOT JUST FOR OTHERS. THAT'S GOOD for
[1:53:30] those people because they, you know,
[1:53:32] they're not the SPECIAL KIND OF BAD I
[1:53:33] AM. NO, IT'S FOR ME. IT'S FOR you as an
[1:53:37] individual TO RECOGNIZE THE GRACE OF GOD
[1:53:40] IS ALL COMPLETE FOR YOU. AND WHEN I PUT
[1:53:43] MY FAITH IN WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE,
[1:53:46] GOD DECLARES ME AS RIGHTEOUS.
[1:53:50] AND IF I AM RIGHTEOUS BECAUSE OF THAT,
[1:53:52] THE CHOCOLATE DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.
[1:53:55] AND NOW I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT. NOW
[1:53:58] MY EYES ARE FOCUSED ON CHRIST. NOW, NOW
[1:54:01] THERE'S STRENGTH COMING INTO ME BECAUSE
[1:54:03] ALL THIS WAS DOING WAS CAUSING WORRY.
[1:54:06] AND THERE WAS NO FRUIT CUZ I WAS MARRIED
[1:54:08] TO THE LAW, BUT NOW I'M MARRIED TO THE
[1:54:10] SPIRIT. AND THERE'S FRUIT AFTER FRUIT.
[1:54:13] AND THERE'S GROWTH UPON GROWTH UPON
[1:54:15] GROWTH. THERE'S LINE UPON LINE, PRECEPT
[1:54:18] UPON PRECEPT. AND AS I'M GROWING, THESE
[1:54:21] THINGS ARE FALLING AWAY.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE AGAINST HOPE, I BELIEVED IN
[1:54:28] HOPE. AND HE COUNTED MY FAITH AS
[1:54:31] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; AND I WASN'T WORRIED about it anymore.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; I didn't spend two weeks talking bad
[1:54:38] about myself in the mirror, making my
[1:54:40] knees hurt at the Look, I'm not against
[1:54:42] coming to like, if you feel the need to
[1:54:44] come to the altar and repent, you come
[1:54:45] to the altar and repent. Nothing against
[1:54:47] that.
[1:54:48] But if it's so that you can feel better
[1:54:50] about yourself, you you're wasting your
[1:54:53] time.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; But if it's coming and saying, "God, I
[1:54:56] just want to dwell in your presence so
[1:54:58] that I can just be reminded
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; that you have already done it."
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:07] Amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Because he has he has t he has taken
[1:55:11] care of it. And all you're doing all
[1:55:13] you're all you're I'm in the mirror and
[1:55:15] I'm at the altar and I'm you know
[1:55:18] kicking myself and not going to church
[1:55:20] and not reading my Bible not praying
[1:55:22] because I feel like God doesn't want to
[1:55:23] talk to me cuz you know I was just mean
[1:55:26] to him and I let him down.
[1:55:32] Well yeah he you know are you getting
[1:55:34] stronger in your two weeks of penance
[1:55:37] before you can pray again?
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; He's like brother Trevor but I really
[1:55:40] want to be righteous. Okay. By
[1:55:43] so by by not praying for two weeks, you
[1:55:47] like this is going to help you be
[1:55:48] righteous.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Like you like forgive me for just a
[1:55:52] minute here. Like like he's like, "Okay,
[1:55:54] here's brother Trevor's quintessential
[1:55:56] sarcasm coming out." Like it's for a
[1:55:58] purpose. Like I want this to seem so
[1:56:01] ridiculous to us that we're never
[1:56:03] tempted to do this again.
[1:56:05] Your two weeks of PENANCE OF NOT PRAYING
[1:56:08] DOES IT CANNOT MAKE YOU MORE RIGHTEOUS.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; BUT FAITH IN WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY DONE.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; And now we SPEND THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
[1:56:22] GOING, I'm a loser. But God, you
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; you
[1:56:36] But God, you love me.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; And God, it seems, you know, it just
[1:56:41] seems weird, Lord, because I just said I
[1:56:43] was a loser, but you love me. So now
[1:56:45] what I'm saying is is God, you love
[1:56:47] losers.
[1:56:50] And I struggle with that. So
[1:56:54] must not be true.
[1:56:56] It must mean then that I'm actually not
[1:56:59] a loser. I'm actually a bloodbought
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; spiritborn
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; son or daughter of the living God which
[1:57:07] then by definition like I you are not
[1:57:11] you are you are among a class of the
[1:57:14] most elite winners who have ever elitely
[1:57:18] won anything ever because like it just
[1:57:22] you it's like you're a child of almighty
[1:57:25] God
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; right
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; it's like I'm pretty sure like there's a
[1:57:30] podium of, you know, one, two, and
[1:57:32] three, and you're like, "Yeah,
[1:57:35] yeah, you get away people like I just
[1:57:38] you can't handle my winningness."
[1:57:45] Like the all like Jesus Christ himself
[1:57:49] wants to spend the rest of eternity
[1:57:54] in flesh with me in my flesh. He wants
[1:57:58] to be around me every single day. Like
[1:58:02] you can't like winning can't be defined
[1:58:05] any deeper than that.
[1:58:09] So though in your flesh you may feel
[1:58:12] like a loser. faith, the eyes of faith
[1:58:14] sees and recognizes that because of what
[1:58:18] God has done and that I have that that
[1:58:20] he has placed the desire in me to call
[1:58:23] out to him and say, "God, I want what
[1:58:25] you have done for me. I I am I I am
[1:58:28] defined as righteous because you have
[1:58:31] declared it. I am defined as a winner
[1:58:34] because of my relation to you."
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; It's what we spend and you musicians,
[1:58:39] you come before I talk anymore, but
[1:58:43] That's what we spent winter youth
[1:58:44] retreat this year talking about was
[1:58:47] recognizing our truly what our who our
[1:58:49] who we are because of our identity in
[1:58:51] Jesus Christ. And it starts with
[1:58:53] recognizing who he is. And then when you
[1:58:55] see your part in him,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; it's like wow. And this is part of that
[1:59:02] to recognize he desires you and did this
[1:59:06] grace all for you.
[1:59:10] And so it I guess you can just have to
[1:59:13] choose then in Romans 7 is beginning to
[1:59:15] transition us from law
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; into spiritfilled life.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; And if you're living in the spirit then
[1:59:24] just I would just say keep believing
[1:59:27] him.
[1:59:28] It seems simple but if you're walking
[1:59:31] daily with him
[1:59:34] these things are going to fall away.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Is there smart things? Is there wisdom?
[1:59:38] Is there things? Yes, there's practical
[1:59:39] things that you can do. You can put
[1:59:41] chocolate in your box and put it under
[1:59:43] lock and key. That's that's maybe
[1:59:45] helpful. Accountability partners, all
[1:59:47] the rest. Not saying anything against
[1:59:48] all that. Maybe all of that's a great
[1:59:50] idea. But if it hasn't started with
[1:59:52] faith first,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; it's not going to be righteousness when
[1:59:56] you get done.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:59] Christ. Heavenly Father, Lord, we look
[2:00:01] to you now, Lord. There's other
[2:00:04] scriptures, maybe other quotes, Lord,
[2:00:05] about Lord about how it's our duty to
[2:00:08] repent. And
[2:00:11] but it's the guide that takes us the
[2:00:13] rest of the way. Oh, Father, you as the
[2:00:15] Holy Spirit are guiding us and leading
[2:00:17] us. And Lord, your prophet declared that
[2:00:20] it was it was you who would take us on.
[2:00:23] So, Father, we just want to yield and
[2:00:25] surrender to you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we
[2:00:28] want to be washed by your grace. We want
[2:00:30] to be we want to be taken away. We want
[2:00:32] to be captivated by your love and by
[2:00:33] your grace for us, Lord God, to
[2:00:35] recognize, Lord, that Lord, not to not
[2:00:38] to give us an excuse, not to not to
[2:00:41] Lord, give us any uh that that we would
[2:00:44] sin again and again. Father, it we hate
[2:00:46] it, Lord God.
[2:00:49] But Lord, you've already made the way.
[2:00:53] Oh, how we love you, Lord Jesus. Oh
[2:00:56] Lord, maybe
[2:00:58] Lord, let your spirit, Lord, come.
[2:01:01] Speak to our hearts, Lord Jesus, about
[2:01:03] the depth of your grace.
[2:01:07] How you want to live inside of us. How
[2:01:10] you want to make us righteous, Lord. How
[2:01:12] you want to walk with us every day.
[2:01:14] Lord,
[2:01:15] come and speak to our hearts.
[2:01:18] We love you, Father, in Jesus name.
[2:01:22] Amen.
[2:01:35] I was made for more. Just a little song
[2:01:39] that says I was I was made for more. I
[2:01:42] know who I am.
[2:01:48] I know who you are.

[2:07:13] who you are.
[2:07:18] The cross of salvation
[2:07:24] was only the start.
[2:07:30] Now I am chosen.
[2:07:35] I'm free and forgive.
[2:07:41] I have a future
[2:07:46] and it's worth living
[2:07:53] cuz I wasn't made to be tempted and

[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. up again.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; I was made from home
[2:08:13] for
[2:08:16] so

[2:08:22] mountain of grace is running my way. I

[2:08:38] Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] Amen.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was made for more.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; There's a fountain of grace.
[2:08:49] Yeah.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Like if you if you desire the grace of
[2:08:54] God, you can like it is it is the title
[2:08:57] wave of all title waves. If you desire
[2:09:00] it, it it it is coming for you and there
[2:09:03] is just there is I mean it's like stand
[2:09:05] there, you know, I used to have a boss
[2:09:07] that would tell me, you know, there's so
[2:09:09] much work coming at you. You know, it's
[2:09:11] like you've got the tsunami coming and
[2:09:12] you're holding a Dixie cup. And it's
[2:09:15] like like this is like, "Hey Lord, I
[2:09:17] want some grace.
[2:09:20] Go ahead, take your Dixie cup of what
[2:09:22] you think he's going to bring to you and
[2:09:24] just let that tsunami of grace come and
[2:09:27] just
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; like just take you away because it will
[2:09:32] if you'll let if you'll let God do it,
[2:09:34] he is going to do it in your life." Like
[2:09:36] that you can just take it to the bank.
[2:09:38] He has promised it. So let it become
[2:09:40] manifest in your life. Get get out of
[2:09:42] the way of the WORD OF GOD. STOP looking
[2:09:44] at yourself in the mirror and all of
[2:09:45] these things. Like just
[2:09:49] stop tending the grave.
[2:09:52] There's a fountain of grace headed your
[2:09:54] way. Amen.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:09:59] hallelujah. Just trying to think of this
[2:10:01] song in my head. I'm amazed that you
[2:10:04] love me.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:17] Oh, I'm amazed. I'm amazed
[2:10:22] that you love that you love me.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed
[2:10:29] how you came.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Through your preious
[2:10:36] blood, I found porn.
[2:10:41] My sins,
[2:10:43] they're washed. They're all washed away.
[2:10:49] All my sins
[2:10:51] are washed away.
[2:10:57] No one knew how alone
[2:11:01] I was feeling.
[2:11:05] and the emptiness
[2:11:07] I tried so hard to hide.
[2:11:12] Oh, I laugh and said my life was fine
[2:11:16] without you.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; I was covering up the secrets.
[2:11:24] I cried.
[2:11:27] But then one day
[2:11:30] someone told me of your mercy
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; and the love you showed on a hill.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:11:40] Aren't you thankful for that day
[2:11:43] you died
[2:11:45] and purchased my redemption?
[2:11:50] It's when you roast in power and set my
[2:11:55] spirit free.
[2:11:58] I'm amazed.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed, Lord. I'm amazed
[2:12:10] how you car
[2:12:13] through your presence.
[2:12:17] I found I found
[2:12:21] and my sins are washed away. They're all
[2:12:27] washed away.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Hey, they're washed away.
[2:12:36] Lord, it's true.
[2:12:38] There have been days,
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; oh yeah, and I have failed you.
[2:12:44] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[2:12:48] astray.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; All the things that I would do that I
[2:12:51] don't do.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; But I've learned that your love is
[2:12:54] stronger than my weaknesses.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Is it just words and your ear?
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Every time I
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[2:13:07] No one else has ever cared for me like
[2:13:11] you are.
[2:13:14] No other friends could ever be as close
[2:13:19] to me.
[2:13:21] And I'm not afraid to face the problems
[2:13:26] of tomorrow.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; It's knowing you.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You are everything I'll ever need.
[2:13:38] I'm amazed. Oh, worship him now.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; I'm so amazed.
[2:13:45] I'm amazed.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed how you care.
[2:13:52] Through your preious
[2:13:55] blood, I found porn.
[2:14:00] And my sins are washed and washed.
[2:14:04] They're all washed away. All my sins
[2:14:10] are washed
[2:14:12] away.
[2:14:15] And through your precious
[2:14:18] blood, I found
[2:14:24] I still
[2:14:27] know how much you really care for me.
[2:14:30] Through your preious
[2:14:33] blood,
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; my sins are washed. They're all washed
[2:14:44] away.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; All my sins
[2:14:47] are washed
[2:14:49] away.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; All my sins, they are washed
[2:14:57] away. All washed away.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; All of my sins.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; My sins are washed
[2:15:05] away.
[2:15:08] All my sins there. I'll cleanse and wash
[2:15:15] all.
[2:15:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't God so good?
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. That was
[2:15:41] just
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; So wonderful.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Such wonderful real real instruction
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; ministering to our hearts.
[2:15:53] It really exposes the the enemy.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; You know, we I was sitting there and I
[2:15:59] was thinking about
[2:16:02] sometimes when the terminology
[2:16:05] of of addictions is me is is mentioned,
[2:16:10] it can go clear to
[2:16:13] right out to so many other things.
[2:16:16] And yet, it's not limited.
[2:16:22] My mind went right back to where when
[2:16:23] God said when they came into the land,
[2:16:27] he said, "When you get into the land,
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to tear down their posters."
[2:16:35] This is scripture.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to tear down their altars.
[2:16:41] I want you to remove all
[2:16:44] remnants of what's there.
[2:16:46] And when you think about that, that may
[2:16:49] seem kind of
[2:16:51] um how do I place that in my life?
[2:16:56] Mental fatigue
[2:16:58] or repentance fatigue.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; I got it right now. Repentance fatigue.
[2:17:04] Mental pentance.
[2:17:08] And you know what all those things are
[2:17:10] about?
[2:17:11] It's about us. It's about how we feel.
[2:17:15] It has nothing to do with Calvary.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; But yet
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; religion has wanted to attach us to that
[2:17:23] because religion is what you can do.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Salvation is what he did.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it just like this. He
[2:17:34] said, "You could lay on this altar." You
[2:17:37] know, Brother Bram wasn't against wasn't
[2:17:39] against altar calls,
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; but Brother Bram said, "You could lay on
[2:17:42] this altar." He said, 'They could bring
[2:17:44] you every meal and you lay here for
[2:17:47] days. He said, 'But it will never do you
[2:17:49] any good
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; unless you accept what he's already
[2:17:55] done.
[2:17:57] That's why when the Bible says that how
[2:18:00] beautiful are the feet of them that
[2:18:02] bring glad tidings
[2:18:04] and that is our God reignth that what
[2:18:08] what what he has already done what you
[2:18:11] look at and say I need this done in my
[2:18:13] life he's already done it
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; and there's nothing that we can do to
[2:18:18] achieve it but if we can look away to
[2:18:21] him
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; I think that was that was so powerful
[2:18:24] bringing that in within Abraham because
[2:18:26] if if that's where The devil would like
[2:18:28] to get our focus is upon your failures,
[2:18:31] on your shortcomings, upon man, I messed
[2:18:33] up again or this or that. No matter
[2:18:36] where you're at
[2:18:38] in your walk with God, you'll never get
[2:18:41] stronger or overcome where you're at if
[2:18:43] you keep looking at your failures.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; You see him more than just one who is
[2:18:50] there to forgive you. He's there to put
[2:18:52] strength in you.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; And I'll just say it to you like this.
[2:18:55] You might as well go ahead and get ready
[2:18:57] to say that the things that once used to
[2:18:59] torment and used to bother, but God is
[2:19:02] giving you grace
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; to rule over those things.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; I find it incredible how brother
[2:19:07] Brandham would take the message by
[2:19:10] faith.
[2:19:12] By faith, Moses and faith is the
[2:19:14] victory. And he would say it, he would
[2:19:15] phrase it in this way. He would say that
[2:19:18] now the things that once ruled you, you
[2:19:23] now rule them.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; And how that there are things in our
[2:19:28] life that somehow that we can be
[2:19:30] expecting God to just, well, God will
[2:19:32] just strip everything out. God's put you
[2:19:35] back in charge. And you're a son and
[2:19:37] daughter of God. And let me tell you,
[2:19:38] you're always in charge. But we have to
[2:19:41] look to our source of strength,
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; and that's the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; And you know what that be that becomes
[2:19:47] greater
[2:19:49] than anything else.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; And let God prove himself in our lives.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's a reality.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; It's a reality. And I know when brother
[2:20:02] Trevor was going into that
[2:20:06] uh I love that part about I liked all of
[2:20:10] it, but I love that part about
[2:20:13] So what does staying away from prayer
[2:20:16] for two weeks do for you?
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; I mean, you see how the devil does that
[2:20:20] where you don't you don't even feel like
[2:20:21] you're worthy. Let me tell you, on your
[2:20:23] best day, you're not worthy.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; On your best day, you're not worthy. If
[2:20:28] you had 10 days in a row, you're still
[2:20:29] not worthy.
[2:20:31] He never said it. It's a throne of grace
[2:20:34] when you're worthy. You don't need a
[2:20:36] throne of grace when you're worthy.
[2:20:38] We have a throne of grace. We have
[2:20:40] access to God
[2:20:43] by the grace of Jesus Christ.
[2:20:46] And you know what? We've got a high
[2:20:49] priest. I'm I'm not preaching. And I'm
[2:20:50] just
[2:20:52] We've got a high priest that I'm going
[2:20:54] to tell you, he's not you're not looking
[2:20:56] at him through a curtain and he's
[2:20:58] standing on the other side of the
[2:20:59] curtain going, "Lord have mercy. Wow.
[2:21:02] You mean you were tempted in THAT WAY?
[2:21:05] WOW, that was bad." We're not talking
[2:21:07] about an earthly man-made priest.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a great high priest
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; who was tempted in all manner such as we
[2:21:16] are. And I know others like to take that
[2:21:18] scripture, but without sin. He had to be
[2:21:21] to be our atonement.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; He had to be to be our atonement. But
[2:21:26] when the spirit of God has come, do you
[2:21:28] realize the prophet said, "You are more
[2:21:30] innocent than a baby."
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; That's what the power of the new birth
[2:21:35] has done.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; You know, it would just be simple
[2:21:38] tonight just to say, "God, make it real
[2:21:41] what was being said tonight." Cuz I'm
[2:21:43] going to tell you, when this gets real
[2:21:44] in your heart, look out, devil. Look
[2:21:47] out, devil. Look out, devil. You can
[2:21:51] never ever go to battle with the enemy
[2:21:56] ever feeling as though that I am worthy
[2:21:59] enough. David, when he came to Goliath,
[2:22:02] he said, "You come at me with this
[2:22:04] accusation. You come at me with sword
[2:22:07] and spear, but I want to announce to
[2:22:09] you, I'm not coming at you in the name
[2:22:11] of David. a bear killer, a lion killer,
[2:22:14] but I'm coming at you in the name of the
[2:22:16] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, we've got a name.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; I said I'm not preaching. I'm just
[2:22:32] No, you can't have my coat.
[2:22:35] But I feel good. AND YOU KNOW WHY I FEEL
[2:22:37] GOOD? IT AIN'T just about me. I'm
[2:22:39] sitting right there as a pastor and also
[2:22:42] thinking about young people and to me
[2:22:44] when I'm sitting there and it might be
[2:22:46] areas that God's already brought me
[2:22:48] through, but I rejoice that THE PEOPLE
[2:22:51] OF GOD ARE BEING BROUGHT IN LIBERTY
[2:22:54] BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS ALL
[2:22:57] ABOUT. IT BRINGS US INTO LIBERTY OF A
[2:23:01] FINISHED WORK OF CALVARY.
[2:23:04] THAT'S WHY I rejoice because he is
[2:23:07] standing as the unveiled Christ, the
[2:23:09] mighty conqueror before us.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love him.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; I just love him.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; You know, you know what you're
[2:23:16] experiencing tonight? You're
[2:23:17] experiencing that eagle anointing
[2:23:19] lifting us up.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; It It's lifting us beyond man anointing
[2:23:24] and and man, and what what what I can do
[2:23:26] and this. And that had its time, but now
[2:23:29] it's eagle time.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; This is bride time.
[2:23:34] You see this is why even when it comes
[2:23:36] to certain things where a person could
[2:23:38] say yeah back in 1970 somebody told me
[2:23:40] this and this and this happened in my
[2:23:42] life that was 1970.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; God is still God.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; But sometimes the things that worked and
[2:23:50] when I say worked back there what it
[2:23:52] really was was a sincere heart.
[2:23:55] Are you hearing me? Cuz sometimes you
[2:23:57] can hear and a person say I tell you
[2:23:59] what you really got to GET DESPERATE.
[2:24:01] WELL IT'S TRUE. YOU DO got to get
[2:24:02] desperate. You really got to pound on
[2:24:04] the altar. It wasn't because you pounded
[2:24:06] on the altar.
[2:24:08] Hello, somebody. The reason what moved
[2:24:12] God was a sincerity of heart. And if the
[2:24:15] same God could take Peter and in the
[2:24:17] house of Cornelius while he yet preached
[2:24:19] the word, the Holy Ghost fell. Why? Why?
[2:24:22] They weren't even at the altar. God saw
[2:24:24] the sincerity of their heart. And that's
[2:24:27] the whole that's the whole what God is
[2:24:29] doing even in a service.
[2:24:32] That's why walking right out of this
[2:24:33] service right here out of this service
[2:24:36] what God has done in hearts
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; to where you know what you don't have to
[2:24:41] be afraid
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; because there's you got a big brother.
[2:24:46] There's one who's greater than no matter
[2:24:49] what sin and no matter what's taking
[2:24:51] place. And God knows God knows what you
[2:24:54] need and he's got it. He's got it. Just
[2:24:57] trust him. He's got the strength. What
[2:25:00] you need, what must I do? Do what he's
[2:25:04] told Abraham to do. Abraham, I'm El
[2:25:06] Shadi. Come on up to my bosom and just
[2:25:10] draw from me more of me into more of
[2:25:13] you.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; And you get more of God in on the
[2:25:17] inside, Brother Samuel. But I It ain't
[2:25:18] about whether you're worthy. Draw from
[2:25:21] him.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Isn't the Lord good?
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, inside here. I I'm running all
[2:25:31] around inside here.
[2:25:34] And as I said, it ain't about it ain't
[2:25:35] about me. I am so so happy for the word
[2:25:39] of God
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; coming. And I you can just sense it. You
[2:25:43] can just sense things breaking and holds
[2:25:45] and
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; the devil's being put in arm bars and
[2:25:48] he's tapping out. I mean, because the
[2:25:50] spirit of God taking that word and just
[2:25:52] pinning him right in the corner. God has
[2:25:54] a there. This is a special unique gift.
[2:25:56] I'm not lifting up brother Trevor, but
[2:25:58] I'm grateful for the diversity of gifts.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Aren't you?
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; It it just goes to show you we need that
[2:26:05] diversity of gifts.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, there were some things that
[2:26:09] Brother Trevor said last night. And I'm
[2:26:10] not even going to go into it right now,
[2:26:12] but we were sitting in a living room and
[2:26:13] thought, "Dear Lord, I never even
[2:26:17] But God has the gifts the way they are."
[2:26:20] I'm so thankful.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful,
[2:26:24] man. We leave out here. We can leave out
[2:26:26] of here tonight fat and sassy. I mean,
[2:26:30] thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Ain't
[2:26:33] that right, brother Matthew? Thank you,
[2:26:35] Lord.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Thank you, Lord. You
[2:26:39] know what God doing? breaking away
[2:26:40] traditions
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; and it's freedom. Those traditions were
[2:26:45] human stressors that was created and God
[2:26:48] just breaking them away. You know why
[2:26:50] you need to enjoy, you're right, you
[2:26:51] need to enjoy the righteousness of Jesus
[2:26:54] Christ and let him take you.
[2:26:58] Let him take you where he needs to take
[2:26:59] you. Let him do like brother says the
[2:27:01] Holy Ghost. He'll take you to your
[2:27:02] healing. He'll take you and your life.
[2:27:06] What God brings you through,
[2:27:10] it's an overcoming in your life. Brother
[2:27:12] Samuel, will I ever be bothered again?
[2:27:15] You'll be bothered,
[2:27:17] but you rule over it.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; And you know how you rule over it? By
[2:27:21] the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:27:28] Don't you just love him?
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say, "Lord, I love
[2:27:32] you.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; I just love you, Lord. Just so
