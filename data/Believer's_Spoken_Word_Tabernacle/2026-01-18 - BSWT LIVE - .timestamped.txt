[29:30] morning. We haven't practiced this in a
[29:32] minute, but just pray it'll be a
[29:33] blessing. We sang it a few times, so
[29:53] there I was on death row.
[29:58] Guilty in the first degree.
[30:04] Son of God hanging on a hill.
[30:09] Hell was my destiny.
[30:15] The crowd was shouting, "Crucify
[30:20] &gt;&gt; could have come from these lips of mine.
[30:26] Dirty shame was killing me.
[30:30] It would take a miracle to wash me
[30:34] clean.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Then I read
[30:44] the red letters
[30:48] and the ground
[30:51] began to shake.
[30:55] The prison wall
[30:58] started falling
[31:02] and I became a free man
[31:06] that day.
[31:14] Felt like lightning hit my veins.
[31:19] My dead heart began to beat.
[31:24] Breath of God filled my lungs
[31:29] and the Holy Ghost awakened me.
[31:35] Yeah. The Holy Ghost awakened me.
[31:40] When I read
[31:44] the red letters
[31:48] and the ground
[31:50] began to shake,
[31:54] the prison wall
[31:58] started falling
[32:01] and I became a free man
[32:05] that day.
[32:09] For God so loved
[32:13] the whole wide world, sent his own son
[32:20] to die for me.
[32:24] Arms spread wide for the whole wide
[32:29] world. His arms spread wide where mine
[32:35] should be.
[32:38] Jesus
[32:39] changed
[32:41] my destiny.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God,
[32:49] for red letters.
[32:53] When the ground
[32:56] begins to shake,
[33:00] the grace of God
[33:04] started falling
[33:07] and I became a free man
[33:11] that day.
[33:14] The prison wall
[33:18] started falling
[33:21] and I am a free man
[33:26] today.
[33:45] Amen. Let's sing a little chorus.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. As as brother Samuel comes. Amen.
[33:49] How many appreciated that? Let's give
[33:50] him another hand of applause. Appreciate
[33:52] that. Appreciate special singers. Amen.
[33:56] Even I don't want to hear me all the
[33:57] time. It's good to have special singers.
[33:59] Amen. Nobody loves me like you love me,
[34:05] Jesus.
[34:08] I stand in all of your amazing
[34:13] ways.
[34:16] I'll worship you as long as I am
[34:21] breathing.
[34:23] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[34:28] loves me like Nobody loves me like you
[34:34] love me, Jesus.
[34:38] I stand in all of your amazing
[34:43] ways. Oh, I'll worship you as long as I
[34:49] am breathing. Oh God, you are faithful
[34:55] and true. Nobody loves me. Let's sing it
[34:59] again. Nobody loves me like you love me,
[35:05] Jesus.
[35:07] I stand in all
[35:10] your
[35:12] ways
[35:14] and I worship you as long as I am.
[35:22] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[35:27] loves me like you.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. So
[35:38] thankful. I meant to say last night we
[35:41] um uh we had all those um young brothers
[35:45] up here. Um still got a lot of the young
[35:48] ones up here and you help balance out
[35:51] their age, Dad.
[35:54] But uh I so appreciate um just you know
[35:57] in whatever the talent and gift that God
[36:00] has given you you. Amen. Use it for the
[36:02] glory of God.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God's given it for a
[36:06] purpose. And um you know and each of us
[36:08] have a talent. We each have a gift. And
[36:11] you know sometimes it can be it can be
[36:14] sometimes a little hard to find because
[36:15] if we're looking as though that we have
[36:18] to do what somebody else does in order
[36:20] to be gifted or talented. And I always
[36:23] think how brother Brandham
[36:25] when he looked back there and in the
[36:26] message it was brother Creech and he
[36:29] says you know brother Creech he said I
[36:30] believe he said that I can hear you sing
[36:33] those specials and he said if you'll
[36:35] just turn loose
[36:37] he said God will use you
[36:39] &gt;&gt; to lead singing. He said that's your
[36:41] position brother if you'll just turn
[36:44] loose. And I'll tell you, if if my only
[36:47] position is to turn the lights on at a
[36:49] certain time,
[36:51] whatever it is, I'm just glad to be a
[36:53] part of the economy of God. I'm glad to
[36:56] be here. Amen. I feel like Peter. I feel
[36:59] like them on the mountain. Lord, it's
[37:00] just good to be here
[37:02] &gt;&gt; cuz there's no big part, no little part.
[37:05] We all have a part in the body of Jesus
[37:07] Christ. Amen. And that is so true. And
[37:10] we so appreciate God's grace. And man,
[37:13] just so appreciate the word of the Lord
[37:14] last night. And um you know um that was
[37:18] not it it gets announced as a youth
[37:20] service and and yet um the the
[37:23] ministering of the word you know when
[37:25] it's a youth service it's not watered
[37:27] down.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was meat last night was meat
[37:32] for the journey
[37:33] &gt;&gt; and and brother Brian already mentioned
[37:35] it. If you weren't here, you need to go
[37:38] back and listen to that message.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; And that's one you need to keep on save.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; And you say save? Well, you can keep
[37:44] going back to it, but come back to it to
[37:46] a place to where that you stand and
[37:50] become dangerous to hell.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; When that sinks down in our heart, then
[37:56] you become dangerous to the devil.
[37:58] That's how David was. David got to that
[38:01] spot with his walk with God to where
[38:03] brother Bram said when he went to the
[38:05] battle, he danced all the way down there
[38:08] to to meet Goliath cuz he already knew.
[38:11] He didn't see a vision. He didn't see
[38:13] Goliath falling by vision. He didn't
[38:15] know what was going to happen, how it
[38:17] was going to happen. But what he knew is
[38:20] is this is an uncircumcised Philistine.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm a child of God.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; That's how Shamgar Shamgar eventually
[38:27] just one one little verse. one little
[38:29] verse. And he eventually got tired of
[38:31] seeing his family taken advantage of.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; And he just, you know what he did? The
[38:36] prophet tells us, he said, he reached
[38:38] back and he remembered, "Wait a minute.
[38:40] I'm a seed of Abraham. I've got a
[38:43] covenant."
[38:45] &gt;&gt; And when he began to remind himself on
[38:47] the words that God had already spoken to
[38:49] him and God was quickened in that
[38:51] moment,
[38:53] &gt;&gt; brother, there was a divine quickening
[38:54] power that came in there that brought a
[38:57] liberation. not only the Shamgar but to
[38:59] his family and to others. I believe that
[39:02] same God is here this morning
[39:05] &gt;&gt; and I believe God wants to move among us
[39:07] in another in another portion here this
[39:10] morning. Amen. We're just glad to have
[39:12] brother Trevor and sister Anime and uh
[39:15] and brother Zion and Sister Camille his
[39:18] his wife and they've been pretty soon
[39:21] about a year now they'll be married in
[39:23] in March. And so, uh, had a lovely
[39:25] wedding there. And, um, also Gloriana,
[39:27] it was so good to have her here. And
[39:30] &gt;&gt; of course, I'll have to give Ezariah a
[39:32] hard time. I usually do. But, um, we we
[39:35] just so appreciate the Eman family.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, appreciate Brother Trevor.
[39:44] And, um, also, I wanted to make mention,
[39:47] Brother Trevor, as you make your way on
[39:48] up, I How many appreciate the wall back
[39:52] here?
[39:54] you know, little little things, just the
[39:57] little things will get me, you know, and
[39:59] and I every time I'd look at it and I'd
[40:01] see my slides, that color don't look
[40:03] right over here. This color don't look
[40:04] right. And and and you know, of course,
[40:06] uh Brother Willie, he was sitting back
[40:08] there, you know, and there was times he
[40:09] said, "I I've had enough." And so,
[40:11] Brother Willie, he told me, he said,
[40:13] "I'm coming over here. I'm putting my st
[40:14] I'm my everything up scaffolding in
[40:17] order to do it." So, we appreciate that.
[40:19] Brother Willie just really took that on,
[40:21] man, and did that.
[40:24] Amen. I really appreciate that. And then
[40:27] out here the other day, brother, um I
[40:30] showed up and I had to do some last
[40:31] minute measurements on that sign and
[40:33] send some things down there to um Amish
[40:36] country. And so um I came over here and
[40:39] Brother Richie and Brother Shawn are out
[40:40] there and they ended up digging that
[40:43] digging that little trench over there. I
[40:45] don't want to say little, but dig it so
[40:46] we can get the electric to the sign when
[40:48] the sign's put in and have light. So, we
[40:50] appreciate all of that. Amen. Don't we?
[40:52] We so appreciate that. Amen.
[40:56] And uh may God richly God richly bless
[40:59] you. I grabbed brother Willie when he
[41:00] came in last night. I said, "Man, that
[41:01] looks so good up there, man.
[41:04] So good up there." And uh but uh we
[41:08] thank God this morning for his grace.
[41:10] And so let's let's just stand and can
[41:12] y'all play that song, Gratitude. But I
[41:14] know you all know it. I don't have to
[41:15] ask that.
[41:19] Can you sing it or I need to get Paul up
[41:21] here?
[41:24] &gt;&gt; All my words fall short.
[41:29] I got nothing new.
[41:34] How could I express
[41:40] all my gratitude?
[41:45] I could sing these songs
[41:50] as I often do.
[41:55] The song I sing
[42:00] you never do. So
[42:06] I throw up my hands and praise you again
[42:10] and again. Cuz
[42:14] all that I have is a hallelujah.
[42:26] And I know it's not much,
[42:29] nothing else fit for a king
[42:34] &gt;&gt; except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[42:51] I'm in one response.
[42:56] I've got just one
[43:01] with my arms stretch wide.
[43:06] I will worship you.
[43:12] Throw my hands and praise you again and
[43:17] again.
[43:20] All that I have is a highle.
[43:32] And I know it's not much, but I'm
[43:35] nothing else.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's yours, Lord,
[43:40] except for a heart sing hallelujah.
[43:48] Hallelujah.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; So come on my soul. Oh, don't you get
[44:01] shy on me. Lift up your song cuz you got
[44:06] a lion inside of those lungs. Get up and
[44:12] praise the Lord.
[44:15] Lord.
[44:18] So come on my soul. Don't you get shy on
[44:23] me. Lift up your song. You got a lion
[44:28] inside of those lungs. Get up and praise
[44:33] the Lord.
[44:36] Oh, one more time. Oh, come on my soul.
[44:41] Praise you again and again. Cuz
[44:46] all that I have is a hallelujah.
[44:54] Hallelujah.
[44:58] I know it's not much. I'm nothing else
[45:03] fit for a king
[45:06] except for our hearts singing
[45:09] hallelujah.
[45:14] Hallelujah.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[45:26] He's worth all our our glory, all the
[45:28] praise,
[45:30] all the gratitude
[45:32] for all that he's done for us.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:36] Christ. Have your Bibles if you would
[45:39] turn with me to Revelations.
[45:42] Very familiar passage. Revelations
[45:43] chapter 10.
[45:45] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[46:08] Revelations chapter 10. We we will be
[46:10] looking through, of course, verses 1-7.
[46:13] I know that that's probably never been
[46:15] preached on in a message church such as
[46:18] this before, but
[46:21] But I do ask that you that you not turn
[46:24] off and say, "Well, okay, it's
[46:26] Revelations 10 sermon. I guess I've
[46:28] heard this one before." So, you know,
[46:30] we'll just uh standard message sermon.
[46:32] Okay, I got it. I can sleep now. Um, but
[46:36] we'll we'll just try to look at some
[46:37] things. I want to compare and contrast a
[46:39] little bit between Revelations chapter
[46:41] 10 and Revelation 11. And we have a
[46:44] title of redemption in the book of
[46:46] Revelation and what redemption is and
[46:49] what it means. And so we want to dive
[46:51] into that a little bit. But uh verse one
[46:53] says, "I saw another mighty angel come
[46:56] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[46:59] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[47:02] face was as it were the sun and his feet
[47:05] as pillars of fire." How beautiful is
[47:08] that? He had in his hand a little book
[47:11] open, and he set his right foot upon the
[47:14] sea, and his left foot upon the earth,
[47:15] and cried with a loud voice as when a ri
[47:18] lion roarth. When he had cried, seven
[47:21] thunders uttered their voices. Let's
[47:23] just go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly
[47:24] Father, Lord, as we look to your word,
[47:26] we look at Lord, what you wrote for us
[47:30] in AD 95 and 96 when John was on the
[47:34] aisle of Patmas. Father, you put him
[47:36] there and got him in a cave so that he
[47:39] he could he could get with you and write
[47:41] what you would have for your church in
[47:43] the last days, Father. And then as
[47:45] prophesied, Lord, that you would send a
[47:47] seventh angel who would reveal all and
[47:49] and and take up all the loose ends and
[47:52] open up all the mysteries, Lord, at your
[47:54] coming. So Lord, we we're just so
[47:56] thankful, Father, that you've put all of
[47:58] this in here for us. I pray, Lord, that
[48:00] we would miss none of what you have for
[48:02] your bride in this last day. Lord, speak
[48:05] to our hearts now and open this book
[48:07] again. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[48:10] You may be seated.
[48:13] So, just a few comments. I know um
[48:18] you know this is what I think fifth
[48:21] fourth or fifth was like fourth year in
[48:23] a row in January that I've been here
[48:25] just because I keep coming to this same
[48:28] convention for work. So, Brother
[48:30] Samuel's like, "Well, if you're here,
[48:31] we're going to do it." And so, we
[48:33] appreciate that. And but just as as way
[48:35] of maybe just um some people would ask,
[48:39] you know, you see, you know, oh, Brother
[48:41] Trevor, you're getting around a lot and
[48:42] different things. So, I just thought I
[48:43] maybe I'd give it just a little personal
[48:45] report that over the last few years just
[48:47] how the Lord's been using my ministry
[48:49] and growing quite a bit. And um maybe if
[48:52] you followed me on social media, you saw
[48:53] that I found this new app a friend of
[48:56] mine had. And I was like, "Oh, that's
[48:57] neat." and it goes in and it grabs all
[49:00] of your flight schedules and such from
[49:02] your email and puts a big chart together
[49:04] and everything. So, last year it was
[49:06] over 55,000 miles in the air, which
[49:10] that's what I said. I was like, I didn't
[49:12] think it was that many, but you know,
[49:13] you go over to Europe a couple of times
[49:15] and that throws the thousands of miles
[49:16] on pretty fast. And so, um, last year
[49:19] just it was a really, really busy year.
[49:21] A wonderful year for us, hard year for
[49:23] us in some ways and and but a but a
[49:25] wonderful year in other ways. and the
[49:27] Lord just using us uh to to really be a
[49:30] blessing. and did four four youth camps
[49:32] over the last year and um in Belgium and
[49:35] winter youth retreat in Alaska and the
[49:37] normal BYC and um and uh so just just so
[49:43] many things and so I'm just really
[49:44] thankful to the Lord um for keeping me
[49:46] and um appreciate you know all of your
[49:49] prayers and um when you think of us to
[49:51] to pray for us as well in in the work of
[49:53] the ministry and you know inside I'm
[49:55] just you know the same you know I guess
[49:57] I don't feel like I'm 12 inside anymore
[49:59] but maybe I feel like I'm like 22
[50:01] inside, you know, and so you you you
[50:04] look at things like that, you know, as
[50:05] you sit there and you're you're kind of
[50:07] reflecting, okay, see, that was so not
[50:10] me.
[50:12] you're reflecting over the last year,
[50:14] you know, and and um and you're looking
[50:18] back and taking stock of, you know, as
[50:20] as maybe I don't know, as I do that, you
[50:22] know, towards the end of the year and
[50:23] just start reflecting and looking at how
[50:25] the year went and all that was done and
[50:28] everything and and um you know, I just
[50:30] look back and I just shake my head
[50:32] because the 25-year-old inside of me
[50:35] goes, "Who
[50:37] who wants me to come and preach? That's
[50:39] weird." you know, you just, you know,
[50:41] you just think like, you know, because
[50:43] when I was a young guy going to youth
[50:45] camps, this where I'm at in my life is
[50:47] nowhere near what I thought I' I'd be
[50:49] doing and and just how the Lord is using
[50:51] me. So, I'm I'm just grateful to the
[50:53] Lord and and just appreciate having
[50:55] friends like this church and and places
[50:57] that that uh that that find it a
[51:00] blessing for me to come and and be a
[51:02] part of their fellowship and everything.
[51:03] So, I appreciate your pastor, Brother
[51:05] Samuel. Um, I don't know if you know
[51:08] this, you know, it's sometimes hard to
[51:10] appreciate those closest to us. Um, but
[51:12] word on the street is that, you know, we
[51:15] would listen to brother Samuel any day
[51:16] of the week. So, you are very, very
[51:19] blessed. Not just because he probably
[51:22] has the smoothest preaching voice
[51:26] probably in the world, but just the
[51:29] balance and the tenor that he brings
[51:32] things out. It was so evident in the
[51:35] youth um little youth fellowship that we
[51:37] had Friday night. I couldn't get anybody
[51:39] hardly to say the wrong answers so that
[51:41] I could make fun of those wrong answers.
[51:43] Like it just it was just no, it's
[51:45] relationship. It's it's it's connecting
[51:47] with Christ. It's not just about right
[51:49] doctrine and doing right things and and
[51:51] it was just like my just you can you can
[51:53] tell the evident effect of the ministry.
[51:55] So, uh, if you if you haven't said thank
[51:58] you to the Lord lately or appreciated
[52:00] this church, um, I just maybe somebody
[52:03] from the outside looking in. I'm sure
[52:06] you have problems. I'm sure there are
[52:08] times when he is one of the most
[52:09] annoying pastors ever to you, but just
[52:13] recognize in those moments how blessed
[52:16] you really, really are with God has
[52:18] given you such a good pastor. And I
[52:20] don't just say that in every church that
[52:21] I go to, but a really brother Samuel is
[52:23] just really a highlight um for us and
[52:26] for our family. And you know, if if
[52:28] there's a Thursday night where we're
[52:30] where we're not doing much, you know,
[52:31] it's like, "Oh, hey, brother Samuel
[52:33] might be speaking." You know, we can and
[52:35] and so we we tune in uh at times and are
[52:38] blessed by his ministry as well. So, um,
[52:41] just just to tell you you're blessed and
[52:43] not just for your pastor, but just
[52:44] everyone around, you know, look look
[52:46] around and and just, you know, in your
[52:49] heart right now, appreciate the person
[52:51] that annoys you in this fellowship
[52:55] &gt;&gt; because you need one another.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; You need one another. So, amen. Praise
[52:59] the Lord. Let's see here. Anything else
[53:00] I can I can get myself in trouble with?
[53:03] So, um,
[53:06] praise the Lord. Okay. So redemption in
[53:09] the book of revelation and um last last
[53:12] March I think it was um just just 10
[53:15] minutes away here with brother Saias's
[53:16] fellowship brother uh Nathaniel had had
[53:19] been asking he he's like man we should
[53:21] we just got to fellowship in one day
[53:22] over text and then it was like okay this
[53:24] texting is restrictive so we just end up
[53:27] calling each other and and we were on
[53:28] the phone for like an hour just having
[53:30] really good fellowship and he's like man
[53:32] we need to man we need to do just like a
[53:34] deep teaching weekend I'm like well I'm
[53:35] in you know I And so I I said, 'Well,
[53:38] I've been doing this study on the book
[53:40] of Revelation and uh with the church in
[53:42] Dayton there at Brother Severz and I
[53:44] said, I you know, I'd love to just do
[53:46] this and you know, we'll just do it.
[53:49] we'll just do the whole book of
[53:50] Revelation in one weekend and it's
[53:52] advantageous and you know but it's you
[53:54] know but and we had a really good
[53:56] weekend and it it was a lot of fun and
[53:57] we just man we took from one to 22 and
[54:00] we went through the whole thing and I
[54:01] don't know if any of us remembered
[54:02] anything by the time we got done but man
[54:04] going through it was a lot of fun and if
[54:06] if there was five nuggets everybody got
[54:08] then well praise the Lord you know and
[54:09] so
[54:16] &gt;&gt; see what we can do here and so Um, so I
[54:19] I I put this study together and um uh
[54:23] Sister Sue was helping me out with some
[54:25] with some graphics such as, you know,
[54:27] timelines like this. I had timelines
[54:29] laid out. And over here we see the
[54:32] chapters 10 and 11 and 22 because I I
[54:34] just cut a cross-section. And so we've
[54:36] got AD 90 1906 and the Holocaust here
[54:39] and the rapture happening sometime after
[54:41] 200 AD. And we've got the millennium,
[54:44] you know, and white throne judgment. And
[54:45] so we've got these timelines and they
[54:47] correspond to the different chapters in
[54:49] the book of Revelation. And so, uh, she
[54:52] was really great in helping me put this
[54:54] out and I thought, well, man, at some
[54:55] point in time, maybe we should show her
[54:58] handiwork, you know, and so was putting
[55:00] together a booklet and at some point in
[55:01] time, if the Lord carries and continues
[55:04] to help, I'll I'll my plan is to have a
[55:07] kind of a message annotated book of
[55:09] Revelation so that you can read through
[55:10] the book of Revelation and then you
[55:11] have, you know, quotes of the prophet
[55:13] saying what each thing is and we'll have
[55:15] timelines and we'll have, you know,
[55:17] different uh, helps and things like
[55:18] that. So, if it looks good, it'll be
[55:20] because of Sue. And if you know, it will
[55:23] certainly won't be because of me, you
[55:24] know, because this is what I put
[55:25] together is things like this, which I
[55:28] thought was, you know, for me, this is
[55:30] pretty good, you know. Um,
[55:34] but anyway, so we we, you know, I just
[55:36] thought, well, and then I was thinking
[55:38] about I thought, well, okay, we we're
[55:40] going to do a youth service, so we'll
[55:42] we'll do this this one on choice, and
[55:43] then I'll do the one on parenting. And
[55:45] then I was asking which kind of is the
[55:47] next part of that. And then I was
[55:49] talking to brother Samuel. I was like,
[55:50] "Oh, I need to play this quote." During
[55:51] the service, I was like, "Hey, I need to
[55:53] I need to text Brian to make sure I can
[55:55] play this quote from my iPad." And then
[55:56] I was like then I got this feeling of
[55:58] deja vu that I had texted brother Brian
[56:01] about playing a quote for the service.
[56:04] And then I remembered I preached that
[56:05] service here already. So um, so praise
[56:09] the Lord. That was yesterday. And so
[56:11] then I was like, whoa, whoa, great. Now
[56:15] what am I going to preach on Sunday? And
[56:17] so just really looking through things
[56:19] this morning and just trying to be in
[56:20] prayer and ask the Lord to speak to me
[56:22] and just sitting there in the in the
[56:24] office just really felt Lord, if there
[56:26] was like, you know, I usually try to
[56:27] say, Lord, if there's one thing I can
[56:29] say, what is that thing that is just on
[56:32] my heart to say and to express? And and
[56:34] so this thought of redemption and this
[56:37] this this sermon is a is kind of what
[56:40] this message is really all about kind of
[56:42] sermon. And if that's one thing I can
[56:44] say then that's what I want to say
[56:46] because I think I believe this is just
[56:47] so important that God God sent us this
[56:49] message and it's it is just so
[56:51] important. Uh we we need this this
[56:54] message and I and I just wanted to to to
[56:57] re-echo this in in in a in the way that
[56:59] that God has given me to to maybe
[57:02] express it. And so I thought we could
[57:04] well we can you know bring this thought
[57:07] and this is one of my favorite I think
[57:08] one of my favorite sermons of of mine to
[57:10] to bring out one of the favorite lessons
[57:12] of that whole revelation study. Um and
[57:15] uh and so so I thought well this just
[57:17] just just felt like the leading of the
[57:19] Lord here. So um we can look at this
[57:21] timeline here. We you know we start the
[57:22] Leodysian church age in 1906 and and we
[57:25] have you know the cloud in Revelations
[57:27] 10 happening in 1963 and then of course
[57:30] we get into the rapture and then after
[57:32] that there's a tribulation period of
[57:34] three and a half years while the bride
[57:35] is in the palace you know and um and
[57:39] then we come back with the Lord for a
[57:41] thousand-year millennium and uh and then
[57:43] we have a white throne judgment there
[57:46] and then after that we will be in the
[57:49] city um the the the the New Jerusalem.
[57:53] Amen. And so how wonderful that is. And
[57:55] and so I want to compare and contrast
[57:57] what's happening in both Revelations
[58:00] chapter 10 and Revelations 11. And just
[58:02] to highlight this, Revelations 10 is to
[58:05] the Gentiles. Revelations 11 is to the
[58:07] Jews. Just want to kind of give you a an
[58:10] overview so that you can so that as I
[58:12] get into these things, you're not lost.
[58:14] So Revelations 10 we'll look at as being
[58:16] to the Gentiles. Revelation 11 we'll
[58:18] look at as being the same thing, but to
[58:20] the Jews. and Revelations 11 is
[58:22] happening in this tribulation period
[58:24] time. This is as we can see the two
[58:26] witnesses, Revelation uh 11 1-13 and the
[58:30] seventh trumpet in verses 15 to19. And
[58:32] and and we we know that the seventh
[58:35] trumpet is to the Jews as the seventh
[58:37] seal is to the bride. And so these two
[58:40] things, these two time periods kind of
[58:42] they can we can we look at them on a
[58:44] timeline in parallel, but the the net
[58:47] effect is the same that what God is
[58:48] doing to the Gentiles, he is also doing
[58:51] to the Jews when he comes back because
[58:53] God wants to take a bride out of the
[58:54] Gentiles and to take 144,000 out of the
[58:58] Jews. Are we together everybody? We we
[59:01] good to together. Okay. So this is now I
[59:03] I just want to like none of this like
[59:05] none of like we I would just say we
[59:07] understand these things be like because
[59:10] God sent us a seventh messenger
[59:14] &gt;&gt; but these things are biblical these that
[59:17] what we're doing is we're looking at
[59:18] what the Bible says in Revelation. Now
[59:21] we understand that so many like have and
[59:24] brother Brandham will say and brother
[59:25] Brandham will will tell us that he he
[59:27] read Larkin and he read um Uriah Smith
[59:31] and these different ones and and and I
[59:33] have too cuz I wanted to I hey hey what
[59:36] does brother Brandham read, you know,
[59:37] and so so we he he tells us that these
[59:40] other men probed at it but until the
[59:42] seventh angel comes he can bring and and
[59:44] wind up all of these mysteries and just
[59:46] you know if there's anybody here that's
[59:48] ever heard the the line of course that
[59:50] the defectors from the uh the message
[59:52] with their websites has ever says, "Oh,
[59:54] brother Brandham just copied Larkin said
[59:57] someone who never read Larkin."
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Okay, I just want I just want to throw
[1:00:02] that out. Like if you've ever read what
[1:00:04] Larkin said like there are some things
[1:00:07] particularly the church age estates but
[1:00:10] if you get into the seals and you think
[1:00:12] brother Brandham copied Larkin that just
[1:00:14] shows you never read Larkin
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; because it's it's VASTLY DIFFERENT. GOD
[1:00:20] GOD SHOWED random the like the truth of
[1:00:23] these things and then the the cohesion
[1:00:25] that we see in the SCRIPTURE THAT IT'S
[1:00:27] NO LONGER GUESSING at this but it is it
[1:00:29] is it is divinely revealed truth the
[1:00:33] divinely revealed truth OF ALL AGES THAT
[1:00:35] GOD HAD HELD BACK UNTIL THIS time to
[1:00:39] give and to reveal to finish up his
[1:00:41] complete plan that he had in his mind
[1:00:44] before um before the before the world
[1:00:47] began. Now, so what are what do when
[1:00:49] when we look at this revelations 22 and
[1:00:51] we get into this in the city in verse 1
[1:00:54] through uh 1-5 we understand that this
[1:00:57] is the new Jerusalem coming down and so
[1:01:00] what is the whole like why like what is
[1:01:02] this it's like well you know you know
[1:01:04] your common Christian understanding is
[1:01:06] is like do you WANT TO GO TO heaven you
[1:01:09] know it's like okay where are you going
[1:01:10] to go when you die to heaven okay what
[1:01:12] is that well I don't know like it's
[1:01:13] above the clouds and then we got
[1:01:14] airplanes and we realized that heaven
[1:01:16] wasn't above the clouds clouds,
[1:01:19] you know, there wasn't people on the
[1:01:20] clouds and angels wings and looking down
[1:01:23] over the cloud to see their families and
[1:01:25] how everybody was getting along, you
[1:01:26] know, it's like, okay, praise God for
[1:01:28] airplanes. We had more understanding of
[1:01:30] the scripture when we got airplanes and
[1:01:34] and so so you KNOW, AND SO IT'S LIKE,
[1:01:36] OKAY, WELL, so what is heaven and what
[1:01:38] do we even mean by that? Like what is
[1:01:39] the whole point? It's like and and
[1:01:41] Christianity, you know, has has, you
[1:01:43] know, do good works, go to heaven, do
[1:01:46] bad works, go to hell. Like, it's just
[1:01:48] this is very simple. It's like, is that
[1:01:50] But is THAT REALLY WHAT GOD IS LOOKING
[1:01:51] FOR?
[1:01:53] is a is I'm just some benevolent
[1:01:56] dictator
[1:01:58] that says if you you know do things
[1:02:00] right enough you get to come with me and
[1:02:02] you get to be rewarded you know with
[1:02:04] starbursts and Skittles and
[1:02:07] you know wonderful snoodles
[1:02:09] you know in in heaven this sermon
[1:02:13] sponsored by Krowskis but anyway no I'm
[1:02:16] just kidding um and so you know um it's
[1:02:20] like like this is rewards IN HEAVEN LIKE
[1:02:22] WELL WHAT IS THE REWARDS LORDS IN
[1:02:24] HEAVEN. WHAT IS IT? JUST, you know, you
[1:02:26] get wonderful things because you did
[1:02:27] enough good things. It's like, no,
[1:02:29] that's so lame.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S SO THAT IS SO like the word
[1:02:35] hedonistic. LIKE, THAT'S SO SELFISH.
[1:02:37] IT'S LIKE, I'M GOING TO DO ENOUGH GOOD
[1:02:38] WORKS SO THAT I can be rewarded
[1:02:40] eternally.
[1:02:43] All the snoodles I ever wanted in heaven
[1:02:45] and I won't gain weight.
[1:02:49] That is what this is like heaven to me.
[1:02:52] Praise God. Oh, this is like heaven to
[1:02:55] me. Like late like, okay, come on. At
[1:02:58] some point in time, you have eaten too
[1:03:00] many snoodles and it's not good anymore.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; I that's possible. I'm pretty sure it
[1:03:09] would be hard, but not but it but not
[1:03:10] imposs RIGHT. SO, LIKE WHAT IS REWARD IN
[1:03:12] HEAVEN? WHAT IS WHAT REALLY is
[1:03:14] redemption? What is it that we are being
[1:03:16] REDEEMED OR CALLED BACK TO? WHAT IS THAT
[1:03:20] city for us? Well, well, it is it is the
[1:03:23] it is the full manifestation OF THE MIND
[1:03:26] OF GOD IN IN IN ITS PHYSICAL
[1:03:28] MANIFESTATION in that IS TO SAY THAT GOD
[1:03:31] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD
[1:03:33] before he created EVERYTHING WANTED TO
[1:03:35] DWELL WITH HIS OWN ATTRIBUTES. SO HE
[1:03:39] CREATED MAN AND HE CREATED HIMSELF A MAN
[1:03:42] TO STEP INTO TO TO TO EXPRESS HIMSELF TO
[1:03:46] THOSE ATTRIBUTES IN THE SAME EQUAL WAY.
[1:03:49] AND SO THEN FINALLY IN THAT CITY, THAT
[1:03:52] CITY COMING DOWN, WE WILL DWELL WITH HIM
[1:03:55] physically forever.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; The reward of heaven IS THAT YOU DWELL
[1:04:01] WITH HIM.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; The reward for HIM IS THAT HE DWELLS
[1:04:05] WITH YOU.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT HE ALWAYS PURPOSED AND WHAT
[1:04:08] HE ALWAYS PLANNED. THIS WAS THE HARMONY
[1:04:11] AND THE BEAUTY THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR.
[1:04:13] IT'S FAR MORE THAN SNOODLES. IT IS SO
[1:04:15] MUCH MORE. IT IS TO DWELL WITH THE ONE
[1:04:18] THAT IS THE SOURCE OF EVERYTHING GOOD
[1:04:19] AND WONDERFUL.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; OH, THIS IS OUR REDEMPTION. THIS IS WHAT
[1:04:25] WE'RE BEING CALLED BACK TO IS LIKE, AM I
[1:04:26] BEING REDEEMED? WELL, WHAT IS WHAT IS
[1:04:28] REDEMPTION?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to be redeemed? Is it
[1:04:33] does it mean to be just merely sinless
[1:04:35] now? Like I like Adam and Eve, you know,
[1:04:38] they were in the Garden of Eden. They
[1:04:40] were, you know, they were sinless and
[1:04:43] then the fall happened. And so Jesus
[1:04:45] need to come and die so that we could be
[1:04:48] redeemed.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; And so then we're He died and so now
[1:04:51] we're redeemed. Well, in what way? Well,
[1:04:54] we're sinless now like Adam and Eve
[1:04:55] were. It's like, well, is that is that
[1:04:57] all that it was? Is that all that we
[1:04:58] were looking for? Is sinlessness? Is
[1:05:01] mere sinlessness
[1:05:03] all that we want? Well, I mean,
[1:05:08] that sounds pretty good. You going to
[1:05:10] make this harder? like not only do we
[1:05:12] have to be sinless, but now we've got to
[1:05:13] be somehow better than sinless.
[1:05:18] You don't redeem yourself.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; So, I would ask you this. When when
[1:05:25] Jesus died on the cross, were you
[1:05:28] redeemed?
[1:05:33] Ben, what's your rule? Don't ever answer
[1:05:36] the question or say amen in the first 30
[1:05:38] minutes of Brother Trevor's sermon.
[1:05:42] Do not nod your head. Affirmative. Stay
[1:05:45] like a statue.
[1:05:49] Were you REDEEMED WHEN JESUS DIED ON THE
[1:05:51] CROSS?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; WELL, I mean, our common CHRISTIAN
[1:05:54] UNDERSTANDING IS LIKE, YES. YEAH. He
[1:05:57] Well, he paid for our redemption on
[1:06:00] Calvary,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; but were you redeemed? Are you currently
[1:06:04] redeemed? It's like, well, yes.
[1:06:08] No.
[1:06:10] Maybe
[1:06:16] you were your redemption was paid for.
[1:06:18] But but but when YOU WOKE UP THIS
[1:06:20] MORNING AND WENT, "OH,
[1:06:28] feels so good to be redeemed."
[1:06:31] NO. NO. NOT THAT'S THERE'S MORE TO
[1:06:34] REDEMPTION THAN JUST THAT JESUS DIED FOR
[1:06:37] YOU. BUT NO, HE WANTS THERE'S THE re
[1:06:40] like full redemption is we're in the
[1:06:43] city WITH HIM AND WE DON'T EVEN SLEEP.
[1:06:45] SO WHEN WE DON'T EVEN SLEEP, WE DON'T
[1:06:46] WAKE UP GOING, "OH,
[1:06:49] I'm going to get I'm going to get up
[1:06:50] because it just hurts to stay laying
[1:06:52] down."
[1:06:59] Redeemer redemption. Brother Brennham
[1:07:00] says, "I like the word redemption."
[1:07:02] Redeemed means to be b brought back.
[1:07:04] Redeemed. As I said this morning, the
[1:07:06] Christian businessman's talking on
[1:07:08] reconciliation. Redemption means the
[1:07:10] devil put you on in the pawn shop, but
[1:07:12] Jesus come and taken you out.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Right? So, this is something that Jesus
[1:07:17] did. and and and and so he's he's put us
[1:07:20] in the pawn shop. But Jesus now he's
[1:07:22] purchased us,
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; but he's also got to come and take us
[1:07:27] out
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; and put us back to where we were always
[1:07:31] supposed to be, which is the
[1:07:33] manifestation of where we were in his
[1:07:35] mind before the beginning. So it is so
[1:07:37] much more than mere sinlessness, but it
[1:07:39] is to be in a perfect body that is able
[1:07:42] to dwell with him forever. that when
[1:07:45] when when that happens, when that new
[1:07:46] Jerusalem comes down, your full
[1:07:48] redemption will be there.
[1:07:51] So, but why why do we need this
[1:07:55] redemption? Like, what is it? What is it
[1:07:58] doing? And again, we we can say, well,
[1:08:00] it's not it's not sinlessness. It's not
[1:08:03] just that Jesus died for me and now I
[1:08:05] have I'm justified as if I've never
[1:08:08] sinned in the first place. But it's more
[1:08:10] than just that because like let's
[1:08:12] imagine you're now justified. You don't
[1:08:14] sin anymore. You you've been or at least
[1:08:16] you're washed and you're clean and you
[1:08:18] you know and and now Jesus comes and he
[1:08:21] takes you to heaven in your justified
[1:08:23] state. It hey, you're sinless now. He
[1:08:26] sees you as sinless. YOU'RE COMPLETELY
[1:08:28] WASHED AS IF YOU'VE never sinned in the
[1:08:29] first place. And he takes you and now
[1:08:31] you're dwelling with him for all of
[1:08:33] eternity.
[1:08:35] But what has changed about you other
[1:08:37] than he has washed you and cleaned you?
[1:08:42] like
[1:08:43] do you have the character
[1:08:46] that he would want to dwell with for
[1:08:48] eternity?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Oh no. So then, so then part of your
[1:08:54] redemption then is to not only s and not
[1:08:57] ONLY WASH YOU, NOT ONLY TO sanctify you,
[1:09:00] NOT ONLY TO GIVE YOU THE BAPTISM OF THE
[1:09:02] HOLY GHOST, WHICH IS TO HAVE POWER TO
[1:09:05] CAST OUT DEMONS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS
[1:09:07] TOO, BUT ALSO THE POWER TO WORK INSIDE
[1:09:10] OF YOU to grow you into the same stature
[1:09:14] and character OF JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF.
[1:09:18] So that when you're over there, THERE'S
[1:09:21] THERE'S NOT THIS HONEST AND TRULY
[1:09:23] THERE'S NOT I MEAN, HE IS GOD, BUT THERE
[1:09:25] IS NOT THIS VAST CHASM OF difference
[1:09:28] between him and you where he's just
[1:09:30] like, "Oh, sweetie, my little bride,
[1:09:33] you're so cute.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; You don't know anything and you have
[1:09:37] zero character, but it's so good to
[1:09:38] dwell with you." Really? Really?
[1:09:42] No. No. because he is his his point in
[1:09:46] giving us the word is that we might be
[1:09:49] ma we might be molded and shaped in his
[1:09:53] very image. Isn't that what WE'RE BEING
[1:09:55] TAUGHT? LIKE WHAT IS THE WORD COMING TO
[1:09:57] DO? If it's is it just coming to mere to
[1:10:00] make us merely sinless OR IS IT COMING
[1:10:03] TO REVEAL THE MIND OF GOD TO US THAT IT
[1:10:06] MAY NOT JUST STAY DORMANT IN THE MIND
[1:10:08] BUT COME DOWN INTO THE HEART AND AND AND
[1:10:11] BE be worked through and CHURNED AND AND
[1:10:14] THOUGHT ABOUT AND AND AND LET THAT WORD
[1:10:16] reveal where we're where we're LACKING
[1:10:18] SO THAT WE MIGHT GROW INTO HIS OWN
[1:10:21] STATURE, THE STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL OF THE JOY AND THE LOVE AND THE
[1:10:26] HOPE AND THE PEACE AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:10:28] AND THE HOLINESS ON DISPLAY CLOTHED NOT
[1:10:31] ON EXTERNALLY WITH THE WORD BUT CLOTHED
[1:10:34] FROM THE INSIDE OUT. WE HAVE BECOME THE
[1:10:38] VERY WORD OF THE LIVING GOD MANIFESTED
[1:10:40] IN our very lives.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; SO HOW IS GOD THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF
[1:10:46] REDEMPTION BECAUSE IF YOU WERE IN THE
[1:10:48] MIND OF GOD YOU WERE SO BEFORE THE
[1:10:50] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD YOU WERE SO MUCH
[1:10:52] MORE THAN MERE SINLESSNESS.
[1:10:56] SO REDEMPTION TO BRING US BACK TO A
[1:10:58] MANIFESTED STATE OF WHAT YOU WERE IN THE
[1:11:01] MIND OF GOD MUST MEAN TO BRING THIS BODY
[1:11:04] INTO SUBJECTION TO THE WORD OF GOD WHICH
[1:11:06] IS MORE THAN JUST SOME KIND OF HEADSHIP.
[1:11:09] BUT THERE'S A COMPLETION OF WHO I AM IN
[1:11:12] THE WORD MANIFESTING ME PHYSICALLY THAT
[1:11:16] I MIGHT BE WHO I WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE
[1:11:19] WHEN I WAS IN THE MIND OF GOD. THAT IS
[1:11:21] REDEMPTION.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AND JESUS PURCHASED THE WAY
[1:11:25] BACK ON CALVARY AND BEGAN THE PROCESS OF
[1:11:28] REDEMPTION. BUT IT DID NOT STOP THERE.
[1:11:31] BUT GOD THEN COMING DOWN IN REVELATION
[1:11:34] 10 TO LIKE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME IN
[1:11:36] THE STATURE AND IMAGE OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:11:39] HOW YOU GOING TO DO THAT IF YOU DON'T
[1:11:42] KNOW WHO he is?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE JUST,
[1:11:46] you know, CATHOLICS OR BAPTISTS OR
[1:11:48] PENTECOSTALS, YOU KNOW, AND WE WERE
[1:11:50] GOING TO COME INTO THE IMAGE OF GOD,
[1:11:52] WE'D HAVE TO DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO TWO
[1:11:53] people and one spirit,
[1:11:58] which as I heard the other day from a
[1:12:01] reliable trinitarian, that the Holy
[1:12:03] Spirit was the love between the two, the
[1:12:06] father and the son. And I just stopped
[1:12:08] the podcast because I can't take it.
[1:12:12] That's so stupid.
[1:12:15] Like you're a you're a grown man. You're
[1:12:19] supposed to be smart and you think the
[1:12:21] Holy Spirit is the love between the
[1:12:23] father and the son. I can't I just I
[1:12:26] can't do it.
[1:12:29] I don't know how I got on that. Oh yeah,
[1:12:31] cuz I was like if we're like we have to
[1:12:34] know who he is
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; to be redeemed to to his likeness. We
[1:12:38] have to know who he is. And that is not
[1:12:40] three of us. THAT MUST MEAN IT'S ONE.
[1:12:44] HALLELUJAH. Praise the Lord. Nobody has
[1:12:46] TO CUT THEMSELVES IN HALF.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; SO THEN SO THEN THE PROBLEM IS what what
[1:12:53] we need then for redemption is more than
[1:12:56] Jesus merely dying for us seems wrong.
[1:12:59] Like but but but that THAT THAT THAT IS
[1:13:01] THE START OF THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION. BUT
[1:13:04] HE WAS NOT GOING TO STAY JUST THERE, BUT
[1:13:06] HE WAS GOING TO CONTINUE to bring you to
[1:13:09] a place OF GROWTH AND STATURE, WHICH
[1:13:12] MUST MEAN AT SOME POINT HE'S GOING TO
[1:13:14] HAVE TO COME DOWN himself
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; to reveal the errors that have been
[1:13:20] happening in HIS OWN NAME TO SHOW US.
[1:13:24] NO, THIS IS WHERE IT IS. THIS IS ALWAYS
[1:13:27] WHAT THIS THAT THE CHRISTIANS OF ALL
[1:13:29] AGES HAVE BEEN STRIVING TO DO. BUT HERE
[1:13:32] I AM. IT IS NOT MERELY JUST WORD
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; LETTER FORM. BUT NOW THE LETTER FORM IS
[1:13:39] BEING SPOKEN AND MANIFESTED BEFORE YOU
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; IN THE LIFE OF A PROPHET OF GOD TO SHOW
[1:13:46] YOU THE FIRST FRUITS OF THIS IS WHAT
[1:13:48] YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And you and you can be now BECAUSE I'M
[1:13:55] SHOWING YOU CLEARLY WHO I am now. So, so
[1:13:59] that's that's a that's some meat. And
[1:14:02] you could take me wrong when I just said
[1:14:04] that and think, well, what does brother
[1:14:05] Trevor think about brother Brandham now?
[1:14:07] And was he trying to say and no, I'm
[1:14:09] trying to say that he is not God. That
[1:14:11] is not what I'm, you know,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; but that God was using him
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; to show us
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; who Christ was
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; to bring out doctrine that would be that
[1:14:26] which completed our redemption. Okay, we
[1:14:29] need to hurry through a lot of this.
[1:14:32] Okay. So, Revelations 10 1-7. Um, I saw
[1:14:36] another mighty angel come down from
[1:14:38] heaven clothed with a cloud, a rainbow
[1:14:39] was upon his head, his face as it were
[1:14:41] the sun, and his feet as pillars of
[1:14:43] fire. He had in his hand a little book
[1:14:45] open, and he set his right foot upon the
[1:14:47] sea, and his left foot on earth. And he
[1:14:48] cried with a loud voice, as when a lion
[1:14:50] roarth. And when he had cried, seven
[1:14:51] thunders uttered their voices. And when
[1:14:53] the seven thunders had uttered their
[1:14:54] voices, I was about to write, and I
[1:14:56] heard a voice from heaven, saying unto
[1:14:57] me, "Seal up those things which the
[1:14:59] seven thunders uttered, and write them
[1:15:00] not." And the angel which I saw stand
[1:15:02] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[1:15:03] his hand to heaven. Swear by him that
[1:15:05] liveth forever and ever, who created
[1:15:07] heaven, and the things that therein are,
[1:15:08] the earth and the things that there are
[1:15:10] therein are, and the sea and the things
[1:15:11] which are therein, that there should be
[1:15:13] time no longer, but in the days of the
[1:15:15] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[1:15:16] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:15:18] should be finished as he's declared to
[1:15:20] his servants, the prophets. And then 8
[1:15:22] through 11 is what the bride ends up
[1:15:24] doing with that revelation.
[1:15:26] And so let's talk about this mighty
[1:15:29] angel that has come down. Who is this
[1:15:30] mighty angel? What's going on here from
[1:15:33] the message the breach between the seven
[1:15:34] church ages and the seals? Brother
[1:15:36] Brandham says, "When the seals are
[1:15:37] broken, the mystery is revealed. Down
[1:15:39] comes the angel, the messenger Christ
[1:15:43] setting his foot upon the land and the
[1:15:44] sea with a rainbow over his head." Now
[1:15:46] remember the seventh angel is on earth
[1:15:48] at the time of the coming.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; So that means when the mighty angel
[1:15:53] comes down, that is Christ. But there is
[1:15:55] a man who is the seventh angel standing
[1:15:58] on the earth at the time of his coming.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Anointed ones at the end time. In
[1:16:05] the very day the son of man is revealed.
[1:16:06] Revelations 10 1-7.
[1:16:09] The seventh angel's message opening up
[1:16:10] the seals. What is it? Not the angel is
[1:16:12] the son of man, but the messenger is
[1:16:15] revealing the son of man. We've talked
[1:16:17] about why now.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Why did he need to be revealed? For our
[1:16:22] redemption. For us to be in his image.
[1:16:24] He's got to be fully revealed,
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; right? Can you be Can you get it
[1:16:29] separated? Now, this is where it seems
[1:16:31] to be so hard for you and it's been so
[1:16:34] hard for so many and many have walked
[1:16:35] away because they haven't been able to
[1:16:37] appropriately or properly separate
[1:16:40] Christ with the son of man or the angel
[1:16:43] on the earth at the time of his coming
[1:16:45] and to keep those and and many have
[1:16:47] walked away because people have other
[1:16:49] people have not done that appropriately.
[1:16:52] But it it's not impossible. We should be
[1:16:54] able to see it plainly. He's telling us
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; not the son of man himself, but the
[1:17:00] seventh angel, the seventh messenger is
[1:17:02] revealing to the public the son of man.
[1:17:05] Because it's left a shock, you can't
[1:17:06] organize it. The grain itself. Again,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; the seventh and last ones of these seals
[1:17:12] when they're opened, it's found in
[1:17:13] Revelation the 10th chapter. There was a
[1:17:15] mighty angel which was Christ. And we
[1:17:19] read there in verse one, I saw a mighty
[1:17:21] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:17:24] a cloud.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Seems pretty obvious.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And where was the seventh messenger?
[1:17:34] Sitting on the ground picking a
[1:17:35] cockleber off of his boot.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Right. On earth.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Right. So this like Revelations 10 HAS
[1:17:43] NOW BEEN physically manifested.
[1:17:46] This isn't prophecy anymore. THIS IS NOW
[1:17:49] PRO PROPHETIC
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; fulfilled history.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; This is the Bible.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And if you can say, well, all you
[1:17:57] people, you message people blah blah
[1:17:58] blah blah like Wolv. What do you think
[1:18:00] this is? You know, BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF
[1:18:03] THE JOHN ate bad pizza
[1:18:06] line of thinking, you know, because
[1:18:08] Christians, they honestly say these
[1:18:10] things. It's like, man, the book of
[1:18:11] Revelation is so hard to understand. And
[1:18:13] it's like John had bad pizza before he
[1:18:15] went to bed and God woke him up and he
[1:18:16] wrote all these things down. Really?
[1:18:18] Really? Because as a Christian, you also
[1:18:20] want to tell me on one hand that the
[1:18:22] Bible is the in inherent INSPIRED GOD
[1:18:26] BREATHED word of God. But somehow when
[1:18:29] we get to the book OF REVELATION, THAT
[1:18:30] SAME INHERENT INSPIRED GOD BREATHED WORD
[1:18:34] OF GOD BECOMES JOHN HAD BAD PIZZA and
[1:18:37] wrote it down.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; No. you. That doesn't MAKE ANY SENSE AT
[1:18:45] ALL.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; SO THEN WHAT IS IT? WELL, WELL, HERE WE
[1:18:48] ARE IN THIS MESSAGE. WE ARE SEEING GOD
[1:18:51] MANIFESTING HIMSELF TO THE POINT WHERE
[1:18:53] HE ALLOWED A PICTURE TO BE TAKEN OF A
[1:18:55] SUPERNATURAL cloud in 1963.
[1:18:58] Coincidentally, while a MAN WHO HAD JUST
[1:19:01] PROPHESIED TWO TWO MONTHS PRIOR IN HIS
[1:19:03] OWN CHURCH about a a constellation of
[1:19:06] angels COMING DOWN AND THERE BEING A
[1:19:08] BLAST AND KNOWING THAT HE'S GOING TO
[1:19:10] RECEIVE MYSTERIES from God
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; and then he is there and then we take a
[1:19:15] picture
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; and then HE GOES AND DOES WHAT? PREACHES
[1:19:20] THE SEVEN SEALS to reveal the opening of
[1:19:22] the word and the mysteries being
[1:19:24] revealed and to begin to and and many of
[1:19:26] the things he HAD ALREADY PREACHED, BUT
[1:19:28] THEN WE HAD THE CONFIRMATION of its
[1:19:30] truth because we knew who THE MAN WAS
[1:19:32] THAT GOD SENT.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; WOO!
[1:19:38] OKAY, so
[1:19:41] he had in his hand and verse two a
[1:19:44] little book open. Right.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Well, where is where where have we seen
[1:19:48] him before? Where have we seen this book
[1:19:51] before in the book of Revelation? And
[1:19:54] so, if we were studying the book, we
[1:19:56] would understand that we would we would
[1:19:58] see in Revelations 4 the throne room.
[1:20:01] And John would begin to describe what he
[1:20:03] was seeing and the rainbow around the
[1:20:04] throne and the four beasts and the
[1:20:05] elders and everyone around the throne
[1:20:08] showing us what this throne was. And
[1:20:10] then in five, HE WOULD BEGIN TO DESCRIBE
[1:20:12] THIS ONE SITTING ON THE THRONE WITH THE
[1:20:14] BOOK IN HIS HAND. AND JOHN WOULD
[1:20:16] RECOGNIZE THAT BOOK WAS THE BOOK OF
[1:20:18] WHAT?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; REDEMPTION.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; The book with the names on it written
[1:20:22] FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD,
[1:20:24] BUT SEALED UP BECAUSE OF THE FALL. AND
[1:20:27] SO HERE'S THE BOOK SEALED UP. AND JOHN
[1:20:29] WEEPS BECAUSE HE knows that there's
[1:20:31] nobody worthy to open this book and my
[1:20:33] name is on it. AND IF MY NAME CAN'T BE
[1:20:36] READ OFF of that book, then then I can't
[1:20:38] be redeemed.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Which is another way to say that the
[1:20:44] revelation of who HE IS IS LOCKED INSIDE
[1:20:47] OF THAT BOOK UNLESS THESE THINGS ARE RE
[1:20:49] REVEALED. AND SO THESE REVELATIONS THAT
[1:20:52] WE GOT IN THE SEVEN SEALS ARE DIRECTLY
[1:20:54] RETIED TO WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR
[1:20:57] IDENTITY IS. WHY? BECAUSE AS WE SAID,
[1:21:00] YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHO he is before you
[1:21:02] can KNOW WHO YOU ARE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; SO, SO JOHN WEEPS BECAUSE HIS NAME IS
[1:21:08] LOCKED IN THERE BECAUSE OF THE SEALS AND
[1:21:10] HE CAN'T FIND ANYBODY WHO'S WORTHY TO
[1:21:13] OPEN. BUT THE LAMB,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH HAS
[1:21:17] PREVAILED. AND HE TURNS AND HE SEES A
[1:21:19] BLOODY LAMB COMING TO TAKE THE BOOK THAT
[1:21:22] WAS CLOSED AND SEALED. BUT NOW IN
[1:21:24] REVELATION 10, WE SEE HIM COMING DOWN
[1:21:27] WITH THAT SAME BOOK AND it's open.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S
[1:21:35] NOW, NOW THIS AIN'T BAPTIST DOCTRINE.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; SO, OKAY, we just talked about this. I
[1:21:46] saw a book written within and without on
[1:21:47] the backside sealed with seven seals. I
[1:21:49] beheld, and lo, in the midst of the
[1:21:51] throne, the four beasts stood a lamb as
[1:21:53] it had been slain, having seven horns
[1:21:55] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[1:21:56] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[1:21:58] earth. And he came and took the book out
[1:22:00] of the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:22:01] throne. And as we said in verse two,
[1:22:05] he now has his hand in his hand a little
[1:22:07] book open.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; So the next thing we see, prepare
[1:22:13] yourself
[1:22:15] for heavy message doctrine.
[1:22:17] You should be scared. You should
[1:22:19] probably turn yourself off. Maybe
[1:22:20] brother Samuel should come up. And so
[1:22:22] you can see his facial reactions on
[1:22:23] whether or not he agrees with what I'm
[1:22:26] about to say because we're going to talk
[1:22:27] about donors.
[1:22:36] So, so like, well, but here it is,
[1:22:39] right? We come down. WE'RE LIKE, OKAY,
[1:22:40] CLOUD COME DOWN CLOTHED with a cloud, a
[1:22:43] book, little open in in his hand, and
[1:22:45] it's open and everybody's good with
[1:22:46] this. EVERYBODY'S LIKE, "WOW, THIS IS
[1:22:47] AMAZING. WONDERFUL." HE CRIES WITH A
[1:22:49] LOUD VOICE and seven thunders utter
[1:22:50] their voices. And we're like, like most
[1:22:53] like when I was growing up, most of the
[1:22:54] time, you know, I was like, "Okay, verse
[1:22:56] one, verse two, verse three. This is
[1:22:58] okay. Well, two. I'm good with that.
[1:23:01] Okay. Three, four,
[1:23:03] five.
[1:23:05] Standing upon the earth and time and
[1:23:07] six, time no more. Like, oh, that's
[1:23:10] way out. And then, so we like one and
[1:23:13] two, we're like his, you know, that's
[1:23:14] happened in 1963. We take the next four
[1:23:16] verses and we ship them off to the verse
[1:23:18] to the future. And then verse seven,
[1:23:19] we're like, yeah, that happened now in
[1:23:21] 63, too.
[1:23:24] And I was like, this never made sense to
[1:23:26] me. And so I'm not again just bear with
[1:23:30] me. I'm not trying to like seven
[1:23:32] thunders. This is a new revelation. No,
[1:23:34] I just but there's some things that
[1:23:35] brother Brennham says I think that we
[1:23:37] can consider and I think that it will be
[1:23:38] beautiful for us to see what's going on.
[1:23:40] Look where the voices was. Thunders not
[1:23:42] in heaven on earth. The thunders never
[1:23:45] uttered from heavens. They uttered on
[1:23:47] earth. Now if we're saying that if you
[1:23:49] look in Revelation, you're trying to if
[1:23:50] you're trying to understand a timeline
[1:23:52] of like the seven seals and and and
[1:23:54] you're trying to lay them down. the
[1:23:56] first four will lay down nice and neatly
[1:23:57] on a timeline and then you'll be like
[1:23:59] five, okay, I could probably place that
[1:24:01] but it's not really, you know, in
[1:24:03] continuity, you know, and then six
[1:24:04] you're like, uh,
[1:24:07] here that I don't know. And then seven,
[1:24:09] you're like, well, you know, the rapture
[1:24:11] is yet to come, but the shout has
[1:24:12] already happened. So, uh,
[1:24:16] now your timeline is blown to bits. And
[1:24:18] then
[1:24:20] you know you might at the either the
[1:24:22] beginning of the fifth seal or the end
[1:24:23] of the fourth seal you'll recognize
[1:24:25] brother Brennham says now we've seen
[1:24:26] what was going on on earth but now our
[1:24:28] view shifts and to see what's going on
[1:24:29] IN HEAVEN. OH, MAN. I tell you what,
[1:24:34] when I saw that, I was like, "Thank you,
[1:24:35] Lord." My brain feels so much better
[1:24:38] because time doesn't happen the same in
[1:24:41] I am space.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; In the in heaven, this is eternity. You
[1:24:44] can't like it impacts time, but it is
[1:24:47] not in time. What time is it now? Yes.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; That's what it is in heaven. Is it
[1:24:52] yesterday? Yes. Is it today? No. Yes.
[1:24:54] Yes. Tomorrow? Yes. It's just I am
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; space, right? So you can't you can't but
[1:25:00] but if he's telling us the thunders are
[1:25:02] happening on earth that must mean
[1:25:04] they're happening in time.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. And so and I was about to write I
[1:25:10] heard a voice from heaven saying seal up
[1:25:12] those things which the seven thunders
[1:25:13] uttered and write them not. It's on the
[1:25:15] backside when a book is completed. Not
[1:25:17] did he say on the front side? On the
[1:25:19] backside after it's all done completed
[1:25:22] then the seven thunders voices is the
[1:25:24] only thing that's stuck to the book
[1:25:25] that's not revealed. It's not even
[1:25:26] written in the book. Okay. Oh my. I wish
[1:25:30] I could get that that people could
[1:25:31] actually Don't fail. Don't fail. Please
[1:25:35] don't. This time I'm fixing to leave
[1:25:37] you. Don't fail. You ever listened?
[1:25:40] Listened. Okay. So, we get to this
[1:25:42] paragraph and you know we like
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon's saying this to you.
[1:25:46] He's like, "Look, don't look.
[1:25:49] Don't miss this
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; point. Please over don't fail. Don't
[1:25:54] fail to miss this. Don't fail them. And
[1:25:56] you you're like, whoa, something big is
[1:25:59] coming.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Are you ready? Okay. These seals are on
[1:26:04] the back side of the book. And at the
[1:26:06] time that the seventh angel is sounding,
[1:26:08] all the mysteries that are written in
[1:26:09] the book is completed. Immediately the
[1:26:11] book that was open and written is
[1:26:13] closed. The mysteries of God is
[1:26:14] finished. This is the mysteries of God.
[1:26:15] The going of the church and all these
[1:26:17] other things. The mysteries is over.
[1:26:18] When that seventh angel sounds, every
[1:26:20] mystery it's over. Let him be who he may
[1:26:22] be. Whatever it might be, God's word
[1:26:24] can't fail. And he said, "But in the
[1:26:25] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:26:27] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:26:28] mystery of God should be finished, as
[1:26:29] he's declared to his servants the
[1:26:31] prophets."
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Did you catch it?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; That deep spiritual mystery that you
[1:26:38] were not supposed to fail to miss. Well,
[1:26:41] remember as he's saying this, like we're
[1:26:43] like, "Wait,
[1:26:46] so don't fail to miss this
[1:26:51] message 101.
[1:26:56] Well, and it's like, well, wait, where's
[1:26:57] the thing? Where's the where's the thing
[1:27:00] I wasn't supposed to? Well, if you know,
[1:27:02] when he's preaching this in 1962, and is
[1:27:06] this the sign of the end, sir?
[1:27:09] This actually, you know, it actually
[1:27:11] hasn't been fully manifested yet.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; What he's saying to us is 101, 60 years
[1:27:17] removed. BUT TO THAT AUDIENCE, WHAT he's
[1:27:20] he's like, "LOOK, THIS IS ABOUT TO
[1:27:22] HAPPEN. Don't fail to MISS WHAT IS ABOUT
[1:27:27] to happen next year."
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And for us, it's like, "Hello." Like, I
[1:27:33] mean, man, I knew that from the time I
[1:27:35] was two. Brother Brandon revealed all
[1:27:37] the mysteries and this was what's going
[1:27:38] on, right? And so but but so it's just
[1:27:42] isn't it hilarious though that sometimes
[1:27:43] we read a paragraph like that and and
[1:27:46] we're like you know and then when we
[1:27:49] when we're like wait I knew that when I
[1:27:52] was two so what is it what is he
[1:27:54] actually saying? What is what's deep in
[1:27:57] here that I'm missing? Like stop calm
[1:28:00] down. This should be simplic this this
[1:28:03] is God hiding himself in simplicity.
[1:28:06] Right? So, if it seems like it's too
[1:28:08] hard, you probably trying too hard and
[1:28:10] you should just let the Holy Spirit
[1:28:12] guide you some more
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; and relax and stop trying to make it say
[1:28:16] something.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:21] Okay. The first seal, that's right. I
[1:28:24] believe that through these seven
[1:28:26] thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:28:29] days in order to get the bride together
[1:28:31] for rapturing faith. What's the point of
[1:28:33] the seven thunders?
[1:28:35] Get the bride together for rapturing
[1:28:36] faith. Okay, simple enough. Is that
[1:28:39] okay? Okay. Because what we got right
[1:28:42] now, we wouldn't be able to do it.
[1:28:43] There's something we've got to step
[1:28:44] farther. We can't have enough faith for
[1:28:46] divine healing hardly. We've got to have
[1:28:47] enough faith to be changed in a moment
[1:28:49] and be swept out of this earth. And
[1:28:51] we'll find that after a while, the Lord
[1:28:52] willing, we'll find where it's written.
[1:28:54] So, how many of you, now I'm I'm from
[1:28:56] the Jeffersonville area, so this is a
[1:28:57] very common thing for us. But how many
[1:28:59] of you ever heard the heard it said that
[1:29:02] brother Brandham said rapturing faith is
[1:29:04] on the tapes. Is that a familiar
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; That's a familiar You've heard that.
[1:29:08] You've heard it. You've heard people say
[1:29:09] it.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You haven't heard brother Brandham say
[1:29:12] it because it's a it's a pretty decent
[1:29:15] paraphrase of what he I I'm not
[1:29:16] contesting that the meaning is is not
[1:29:18] the same. But if you, you know, have the
[1:29:23] message hub app or the table app,
[1:29:26] amen, on your phone, so that you can
[1:29:29] connect with the word of God yourself.
[1:29:31] Because if this message is that which is
[1:29:34] showing us who Jesus Christ is so that
[1:29:36] we can be created in his very image, it
[1:29:38] would behoove us to be in that message.
[1:29:41] That seems logical to me.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, but if you were to take one of
[1:29:47] those apps and you were like, "Rapturing
[1:29:48] faith is on the tapes." You will zero
[1:29:50] results,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; you know? That's and that's annoying
[1:29:53] because you're like, "Wait a minute,
[1:29:55] everybody knows this. This is the MOST
[1:29:57] COMMON MESSAGE PHRASE OF ALL MESSAGE
[1:29:59] phrases and I can't find it." And then
[1:30:01] you're like, "Well, can I believe
[1:30:03] anything anymore?" But this is where
[1:30:05] that comes from. And I remember when he
[1:30:08] swept down there in a big light standing
[1:30:09] yonder the bottom of a river 1933 in
[1:30:11] June when he said as John the Baptist
[1:30:13] was sent to forerrun the first coming of
[1:30:15] Christ I send you with a message to the
[1:30:17] world to forrun the second coming of
[1:30:18] Christ and around the world she's went.
[1:30:21] Okay, who is she?
[1:30:24] Who are we talking about? Well, I sent
[1:30:26] you with a message to the world to forun
[1:30:28] the second coming of Christ. Around the
[1:30:31] world she's went. So the message he's
[1:30:33] he's referring to the message. This is
[1:30:36] what's gone around the world. Revival
[1:30:37] fires has been built for 15 years.
[1:30:39] Nearly every mountain. Divine healing
[1:30:41] across the nations and power and
[1:30:42] restoration. And I believe she who the
[1:30:45] message
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; is ready to strike that final climax
[1:30:48] yonder to bring forth a faith that will
[1:30:50] rapture the church into glory.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; What was the seven thunders supposed to
[1:30:54] do?
[1:30:56] Give us rapturing faith. And she is
[1:31:00] laying in the messages. So the message
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; is laying in the messages.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; We're really at the end time and
[1:31:08] everything, but the thing has moved upon
[1:31:09] us now. Yeah. Here. Yes, sir. Here is
[1:31:11] one. That's right. This you can read
[1:31:13] this quote and it's amazing to me that
[1:31:14] people don't listen to the prophet.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Because what is he saying? He is he is
[1:31:23] comparing his this this message that's
[1:31:25] gone around the world which is the what
[1:31:27] is the thing to prepare the bride to go
[1:31:29] into the rapture and that rapture those
[1:31:32] seven thunders are going to have to
[1:31:34] happen on the earth
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; which means it's going to happen in time
[1:31:38] and IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS AFTER
[1:31:40] THE revelation
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; right
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; God and and and and and begin to begin
[1:31:46] to think through this now it's like wait
[1:31:48] a second this isn't this doesn't have to
[1:31:49] be some like some amazing new thing to
[1:31:53] come. Like, guess what? Here's what we
[1:31:54] need. We need five super powerful
[1:31:56] brothers with just amazing GIFT IN THEIR
[1:32:00] LIFE TO COME AND PREACH US INTO THE
[1:32:02] RAPTURE.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Nobody likes them. I thought it sounded
[1:32:10] good if I was going to be one of those.
[1:32:13] No, I would hate that.
[1:32:16] No, God has already given it to us. Say,
[1:32:18] "Brother Brother Trevor, then why don't
[1:32:20] why don't we have it?" because it's
[1:32:21] like, "Do you have rapturing faith?"
[1:32:24] Yeah, I love that answer. This is like
[1:32:29] potentially
[1:32:30] because here's the deal. You could have
[1:32:32] it latent. You could have it dormant
[1:32:33] inside of you, but until that trumpet
[1:32:34] blows, you ain't taking a rapture.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith works according to a
[1:32:38] law. Until it's time for the rapture,
[1:32:40] you don't take a rapture. Like, go
[1:32:41] ahead. If you have rapturing faith,
[1:32:42] personally rapture yourself right now.
[1:32:44] Go. I will I will change if you leave. I
[1:32:47] will change my doctrine right now.
[1:32:50] like, you know, like, but until it's
[1:32:53] time for the rapture, WE DON'T RAPTURE.
[1:32:55] SO, BUT WHAT'S going on? And you and and
[1:32:56] and you you begin to recognize, YOU
[1:32:59] KNOW, WE CAN ALL LOOK BACK 30 years ago,
[1:33:01] those of us that are at least, you know,
[1:33:02] 30 and can, you know, and can LOOK AND
[1:33:04] SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, MAN, HOW DID I
[1:33:07] understand this message 30 YEARS AGO AND
[1:33:09] I CAN TELL YOU I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT
[1:33:11] LIKE I do today.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Right? And I can preach things like this
[1:33:15] to to to actually elders in the faith
[1:33:18] and their minds ARE BLOWN GOING, "HOLD
[1:33:20] UP. I NEVER SAW IT LIKE THAT. THIS IS
[1:33:23] AMAZING." AND THEN A RENEWED LOVE FOR
[1:33:25] THIS MESSAGE BEGINS TO TAKE HOLD IN
[1:33:28] THEIR LIFE BECAUSE THEY BEGIN TO
[1:33:29] RECOGNIZE THERE'S A THERE'S DEPTH THAT I
[1:33:32] NEVER SAW BEFORE. WHAT IS THAT? BUT THIS
[1:33:34] IS the seven thunders LAYING IN THE
[1:33:37] MESSAGES ALREADY RECORDED FOR US. BUT TO
[1:33:40] BUT TO PROGRESS US BY WHAT? LINE UPON
[1:33:43] LINE. PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT. WORD UPON
[1:33:47] WORD. I MYSELF. HEY,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; brother Samuel can CORRECT THE DOCTRINE
[1:33:52] OF SEVEN thunders later if he needs to.
[1:33:54] But but WHAT BUT WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?
[1:33:55] RAPTURING FAITH. HOW DO I FEEL LIKE I'M
[1:33:57] GOING TO GET IT? BY LAYING IN THE WORD
[1:33:59] OF GOD.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE TO BE REDEEMED, I NEED TO
[1:34:03] see who he is.
[1:34:07] It just it just it doesn't have TO BE
[1:34:10] THAT HARD. THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME
[1:34:12] super the seven thunders. New mystery
[1:34:15] coming at you at our convention this
[1:34:17] July. Come on.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; We've done that for far too long. We've
[1:34:25] been looking for SOMETHING ELSE WHEN
[1:34:27] CHRIST WAS LAYING HERE RIGHT BEFORE US
[1:34:31] IN HIS WORD FULLY REVEALED IN THE
[1:34:33] REVELATION OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN
[1:34:36] REVELATIONS 10:ES 1-7. IT IS DONE. IT IS
[1:34:40] FULFILLED AND WE are living in those
[1:34:42] pages.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. So then time no longer because
[1:34:47] then if the seven thunders you know then
[1:34:49] okay then these one foot on land one
[1:34:52] foot on sea and time is no longer and so
[1:34:54] and that's you know it's like well then
[1:34:56] and so you know the amount of message
[1:34:59] false doctrine that happens right here
[1:35:01] is pretty amazing
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; because we get into whether he's on the
[1:35:05] mercy seat or off the mercy seat if time
[1:35:07] is no longer then can my kids be saved
[1:35:10] all of these things and everybody
[1:35:12] there's a lot of people who say things
[1:35:14] all kinds of different ways and at the
[1:35:15] end result is is that your kids can
[1:35:16] still be saved.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Like no m like everybody's doctrine
[1:35:21] allows for their own children to be
[1:35:22] saved generally unless they're like
[1:35:24] super extreme and have mental issues.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We pray for them, right?
[1:35:30] Yeah. You know, like so, so there's, you
[1:35:33] know, well, anyway, I should really
[1:35:35] getting in trouble here. So, so, so, but
[1:35:40] what are we like what's going on here?
[1:35:42] because if it's connected to the seven
[1:35:43] thunders, which is this laying in this
[1:35:46] message's idea of bringing us to
[1:35:47] rapturing faith, well, what's going on?
[1:35:51] So, brother Brandon begins to to deal
[1:35:54] with some stories here, and
[1:35:56] he'll take us into Abraham and Sarah,
[1:35:59] and this is some more not Baptist
[1:36:01] doctrine here. Notice what happened.
[1:36:03] Immediately, she turned back to a lovely
[1:36:05] young woman showing in there, portraying
[1:36:06] what he's going to do to the royal seat
[1:36:08] of Abraham to receive the son that's
[1:36:10] been promised. Sounds raptury to me. She
[1:36:13] turned back into a young look. They when
[1:36:16] they went down into Ger and what
[1:36:17] happened? Aimilec the king fell in love
[1:36:19] with her. She said she's fair and
[1:36:22] beautiful. Was going to marry her. Is
[1:36:23] that right? Old grandma and all them
[1:36:25] other pretty girls down there. Granny.
[1:36:27] She's beautiful. Fair to look upon. God
[1:36:30] changed her body and turned them back.
[1:36:31] It's a mystery that's to be revealed now
[1:36:34] in this day by the son of man. See the
[1:36:37] evening message. See, turned back. I
[1:36:39] just love this. God is so amazing. He
[1:36:41] held this mystery until the evening
[1:36:44] message to the mystery THAT THAT GOD
[1:36:47] CHANGED ABRAHAM AND SARAH'S BODY THAT
[1:36:50] God sent a messenger with a promise. And
[1:36:54] at that there was a point in time though
[1:36:57] they'd have a promise for 24 years prior
[1:37:01] to this that they were going to have a
[1:37:03] son, but yet a messenger came. And at
[1:37:06] the point that messenger came, A CLOCK
[1:37:10] OF BODY CHANGE STARTED IN their lives.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And they journey into career BECAUSE SO
[1:37:19] NOW WE'VE GOT A MESSAGE THAT REVEALS
[1:37:21] THIS MYSTERY, BUT IS ALSO DOING THE
[1:37:24] EXACT same thing to the people it's
[1:37:26] revealing THIS MYSTERY TO.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S GOT TO OPEN THAT MYSTERY SO
[1:37:31] THAT THEY CAN RECOGNIZE THAT CAN HAPPEN
[1:37:33] TO THEM. BECAUSE ISN'T THAT WHAT'S GOING
[1:37:35] ON WITH THE RAPTURE? IN A MOMENT, IN A
[1:37:37] TWINKLING OF AN EYE, AT THAT LAST TRUMP,
[1:37:40] WE SHALL BE CHANGED.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; SO, they turned back. What was the LAST
[1:37:49] SIGN THEY SEEN? WAS discernment before
[1:37:52] THE CHANGE OF THE BODY. SO, BROTHER
[1:37:54] BRANDON WILL COME AND PREACH A MESSAGE.
[1:37:56] WHO IS THIS MELZDC? HE'LL GO THROUGH
[1:37:59] THIS STORY AND TURN HIS BACK AND DISCERN
[1:38:01] THE THOUGHTS OF THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE
[1:38:04] BEHIND THEM JUST LIKE MELZDC did in the
[1:38:07] days of Abraham and Sarah WHEN HE SAID,
[1:38:09] "WHY DID YOUR WIFE LAUGH?"
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; NOT TO SAY THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS
[1:38:14] MELZDC, BUT THAT THE SON OF MAN WAS
[1:38:17] REVEALING THE SON OF MAN.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO THAT WE COULD SEE THE TIME IS
[1:38:25] NOW, THE CLOCK IS STARTING, THAT THE
[1:38:27] BRIDE WOULD COME INTO THEIR BODY CHANGED
[1:38:30] JUST LIKE ABRAHAM AND SARAH DID.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; WOO! GLORY. And before we can ever
[1:38:35] receive the son, what happens? The trump
[1:38:37] of God shall sound. The dead in Christ
[1:38:38] shall rise first.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; A new body. We are alive and remain
[1:38:42] shall be changed. In a moment, the
[1:38:44] twinkling of eye, caught up together to
[1:38:45] meet the Lord in the air. The secret has
[1:38:47] been made known. The seals are open.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. The trumpet sounded for Israel.
[1:38:53] Two prophets ready to appear. What is
[1:38:55] it? The church must get off the scene
[1:38:56] right now so they can appear. He can't
[1:38:58] deal with two at the same time. So then
[1:39:00] he'll come into the sixth seal.
[1:39:03] You know, the one before the seventh.
[1:39:08] Just throwing that out there. And he'll
[1:39:11] tell us a little story. And you you
[1:39:14] probably know the story. And I'm almost
[1:39:15] done, but I'm hot. So this is not again
[1:39:19] just I'm just getting warmed up to
[1:39:20] preach now the Lord a little story if
[1:39:23] I'm not taking too much of your time now
[1:39:25] and and he'll go and he'll talk about
[1:39:27] this story and and um I feel he says I
[1:39:32] do this for a purpose till I feel the
[1:39:35] spirit just right to start this is a
[1:39:36] sacred thing see who knows them things
[1:39:39] here nobody but God and they're not
[1:39:40] supposed to be revealed and proved by
[1:39:42] the Bible that they would be revealed
[1:39:44] till this day that's exactly right? They
[1:39:46] was guested at and now we're supposed to
[1:39:48] get exactly the truth, vindicated truth.
[1:39:50] So he's talking about truth, vindicated
[1:39:51] truth, all this revelation happening.
[1:39:53] But but but but right now I just I just
[1:39:55] feel to tell you a little story
[1:39:58] in the sixth seal right before the
[1:40:00] seventh
[1:40:03] before the rapture.
[1:40:05] In this story, he begins to talk about
[1:40:07] this this this man from Chicago who's
[1:40:11] the son of of the guy that owns the
[1:40:14] factories and it's so rich and, you
[1:40:16] know, so marriageable.
[1:40:19] And so this guy, he goes out west and
[1:40:21] and they're throwing parties for him and
[1:40:23] all the girls are out getting their best
[1:40:25] on and they're going to these dances and
[1:40:26] all of these things. And then and
[1:40:28] there's this little cousin and you know,
[1:40:30] she's kind of I don't know what happened
[1:40:31] to my slides. Sorry. Has it been like
[1:40:33] this for a long time?
[1:40:35] Okay. And and and um
[1:40:42] yeah. And and and so, you know, he goes
[1:40:45] out west and and then there's this
[1:40:46] little cousin to all of these other
[1:40:47] girls that, you know, that are dressing
[1:40:49] themselves up and you know, she's kind
[1:40:50] of the servant among them and you know,
[1:40:52] she's the one washing the dishes and
[1:40:54] doing all of this stuff. And he begins
[1:40:55] to notice her. He's going to these
[1:40:57] parties and all this, but he begins to
[1:40:59] notice this one. And he begins to notice
[1:41:01] how she carries herself. And and one
[1:41:03] day, you know, he recognized that she'd,
[1:41:06] you know, she'd take the the water, the
[1:41:07] wash water, and he she'd throw it out,
[1:41:09] you know, and in her in her pan, you
[1:41:11] know, and so he wanted to meet her. And
[1:41:13] so he goes and he, you know, he just
[1:41:15] waits cuz he knows about now he she
[1:41:16] should be coming out to throw out the
[1:41:18] wash. And he puts his foot up on the,
[1:41:20] you know, up on the fence and just kind
[1:41:22] of where there waiting. She comes out,
[1:41:24] she throws the wash water, you know, and
[1:41:25] he's like, "Hello." And she's like, "Oh
[1:41:27] my goodness." you know this the guy the
[1:41:29] guy like oh boy that's
[1:41:32] it's not just a guy it's the guy this is
[1:41:34] the guy everybody's trying to catch
[1:41:36] right now and you know what's he doing
[1:41:37] standing here where I throw wash water
[1:41:40] out and he begins to talk to her and
[1:41:42] he's like I've noticed you I've seen
[1:41:43] your character I've seen how you do this
[1:41:45] and I you know it's no secret I'm trying
[1:41:47] to find a wife
[1:41:51] you know he tells the story in the sixth
[1:41:53] seal right before the seventh seal have
[1:41:54] I talked about that yet anyway and so
[1:41:57] I'm looking for a wife. And so he sees
[1:41:59] and and and he begins to tell I've seen
[1:42:01] your character. You're what I'm looking
[1:42:03] for. And and you know, would you would
[1:42:08] you marry me? She's like, I'm just, you
[1:42:10] know, lowly, despised,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; not accounted for as anything, kind of
[1:42:16] looked down on and made fun of. I'm not
[1:42:18] the fancy church. I'm not all of this.
[1:42:21] Why would you want me? Because I've seen
[1:42:22] your character.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Would you? And here I am. I've come to
[1:42:28] you to present myself before you to
[1:42:30] reveal to you that I am a bridegroom
[1:42:32] looking for a bride.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; And she agrees. So they get they up and
[1:42:38] get married. No, no, they don't just up
[1:42:40] and get married. They got all the fancy
[1:42:42] stuff there. There's parties going on.
[1:42:43] Hey, just just make it a wedding and
[1:42:45] let's go. No, no, no. I'm going to come
[1:42:48] back.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; So he reveals himself to her. And then
[1:42:51] he goes and says, "I'm going to come
[1:42:52] back according to a specific time
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; and then I will come and I will take you
[1:42:57] away."
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; That's a nice story. It's just such a
[1:43:03] beautiful It's just a beautiful message
[1:43:05] story.
[1:43:08] Time shall be no longer because there
[1:43:10] was a moment then in time when he
[1:43:12] proposes to her and she accepts and he
[1:43:15] says, "And I'm going to go away and I'm
[1:43:17] going to make a place ready to take you
[1:43:19] for." And she's sitting there and she's
[1:43:21] dressing herself in the word. She's
[1:43:23] believing the promise. They're making
[1:43:25] FUN OF HER, BUT SHE'S LIKE, "NO, HE
[1:43:27] WOULDN'T COME FOR YOU. Who do you think
[1:43:29] you are?" And she's laughed AT AND SHE'S
[1:43:31] SCOFFED. BUT THROUGH ALL OF THAT, her
[1:43:33] faith in what he said and who he
[1:43:36] presented himself as, never wavered. And
[1:43:40] that day CAME AND SHE WAS SITTING
[1:43:42] DRESSED IN THE garments showing that she
[1:43:45] believed his word. And he came AT THE
[1:43:47] TIME APPOINTED. SO THERE WAS A MOMENT IN
[1:43:50] TIME when he proposed to her and
[1:43:52] revealed to her that she was the one he
[1:43:55] was looking for. THERE WAS A MOMENT IN
[1:43:58] TIME AND THEN I WILL GO AWAY AND I WILL
[1:44:00] COME BACK. BUT A CLOCK STARTED.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; There was A POINT WHERE TIME
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A CHANGING OF TIME THAT TIME
[1:44:10] WOULD BE NO LONGER I WILL COME BACK.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE SON OF
[1:44:15] MAN COMES DOWN AND REVEALS HIMSELF AS A
[1:44:19] BRIDEGROOM.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Just a little story. So, we get into
[1:44:24] chapter 11 and and we're really coming
[1:44:26] down on time. But, you know, as we said
[1:44:28] that this was to the Jews, we can look
[1:44:30] at that in verses 1 through3. Um,
[1:44:32] measure the temple of God. That tells us
[1:44:35] now we're talking if we're measuring the
[1:44:36] temple, but and then it'll say, don't
[1:44:38] measure the courts. uh this court which
[1:44:40] is without the temple, leave out,
[1:44:42] measure it not, for it is given unto the
[1:44:44] Gentiles. So what are we talking about
[1:44:46] this chapter? We're transitioning. This
[1:44:48] is Jews. Don't talk about the Gentiles.
[1:44:50] Why? Cuz they're cuz they're going up
[1:44:55] in Revelations 10. Okay? So,
[1:44:58] and I will give power unto my two
[1:44:59] witnesses. They shall prophesy 203 score
[1:45:02] days, 1,23 score days clothed in
[1:45:05] sackcloth. And this is this is a three
[1:45:07] and a half year period. And this is the
[1:45:10] last half of the 70th week of Daniel.
[1:45:13] Wish we had tons of time to dive into
[1:45:15] that fun topic. But you know, so God,
[1:45:18] but what we understand is that we know
[1:45:20] that Jesus died in the middle of that
[1:45:22] week. There's three and a half years of
[1:45:23] ministry left to the Jews, but they were
[1:45:26] blinded for our sakes. Why?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; So that we could we could be in the
[1:45:31] palace,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; right? And so we will liken this and we
[1:45:36] understand and I hope that maybe we'll
[1:45:38] because I'm going to go through this
[1:45:39] really fast. Um so I hope that you are
[1:45:42] generally aware of of many of these
[1:45:44] things. But Pharaoh called Joseph's name
[1:45:46] Zephanfa. He gave him to wife Azeneth,
[1:45:49] the daughter of Piphapara, priest of so.
[1:45:50] So here Joseph is in Egypt. He's been
[1:45:53] rejected
[1:45:55] and and and he comes, you know, and but
[1:45:58] now he's he's risen up and and he's
[1:46:00] given a bride. And I always think it's
[1:46:02] so great because Abraham, you know, he
[1:46:05] he and Sarah wanted to find a good wife
[1:46:06] for Isaac. And then Isaac, you know, he
[1:46:09] and Rebecca, they want to find a good
[1:46:10] wife for Jacob because Esau, Esau got a
[1:46:14] wife and just they did not, they were
[1:46:15] not happy. And so it's like, no, no, no.
[1:46:17] We got to make sure that Jacob gets a
[1:46:19] good wife. And so it's like, man, get a
[1:46:20] good wife. Get a good wife. Get a good
[1:46:22] wife. Then we come to the story of
[1:46:23] Joseph and he's given
[1:46:26] a idolatr's priest's daughter.
[1:46:30] And then the Bible just goes on and it's
[1:46:31] like yeah no big deal like this is no no
[1:46:35] qualification no like and it was okay
[1:46:37] because like no it just goes on right
[1:46:41] but then we understand as the story
[1:46:43] progresses where is this wife she is in
[1:46:46] the palace as Joseph is making himself
[1:46:48] known to his brethren she's in the
[1:46:50] palace behind him
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; just like we will be in the marriage
[1:46:53] supper
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; right and so Joseph could not refrain
[1:46:56] himself we move the story along to verse
[1:46:58] chapter 45 before all them that stood by
[1:47:01] him because caused every man to go out
[1:47:02] for me. And there stood no man with him
[1:47:04] while Joseph made himself known to his
[1:47:06] brethren. And he wept aloud, and the
[1:47:07] Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
[1:47:08] heard. And Joseph said unto his
[1:47:10] brethren, I'm Joseph. Does my father yet
[1:47:12] live? And his brethren could not answer
[1:47:13] him, for they were troubled at his
[1:47:14] presence. And Joseph said unto his
[1:47:16] brethren, come near to me, I pray you.
[1:47:18] And they came near, and he said, I'm
[1:47:19] Joseph, your brother, who you sold into
[1:47:21] Egypt. Now therefore, be not grieved nor
[1:47:23] angry with yourselves that ye sold me
[1:47:25] hither, for God did send me before you
[1:47:27] to preserve life.
[1:47:30] And so, um,
[1:47:34] brother Brandon will say, "Where will
[1:47:36] the gentile church go at the rapture?"
[1:47:37] into the palace. The bride, hallelujah,
[1:47:39] the bride will be taken off the earth
[1:47:40] into the rapture. Then when he returns,
[1:47:43] his bride isn't there. when he makes
[1:47:45] himself known to his brethren, the Jews,
[1:47:47] those who pierced him, those who
[1:47:49] rejected him, but his wife and his loved
[1:47:51] one, his close friends, their his own
[1:47:53] god- sent companions had in the temple.
[1:47:56] Brother Brandon will say in the first
[1:47:57] seal, Joseph, when he looked at them, he
[1:47:58] couldn't stand it, no longer. Remember
[1:47:59] his wife, his children was in the palace
[1:48:01] at the time, the saints gone out of
[1:48:03] their of their presence. And so, we're
[1:48:06] very familiar with the story just for
[1:48:08] time. I'll just skip skip through this.
[1:48:11] And he says he makes himself known. The
[1:48:13] Bible says as we come to it, he makes
[1:48:15] himself known to that 144,000 there,
[1:48:17] that little Benjamin of today. And so
[1:48:21] some of the scriptures that are
[1:48:23] referenced here, as we just put a few of
[1:48:24] these things together quickly, I will
[1:48:26] pour out of Zechariah 12:10, I will pour
[1:48:28] out of the upon the house of David, upon
[1:48:30] the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit
[1:48:31] of grace and supplications. They shall
[1:48:33] look upon me whom they pierced, and they
[1:48:35] shall mourn for him as one that mourneth
[1:48:37] for his only son, and shall be in
[1:48:38] bitterness for him, as one that is in
[1:48:40] bitterness for his firstborn. And in
[1:48:42] Zechariah 13:6, the one shall say to
[1:48:44] him, "What are these wounds in thine
[1:48:45] hands, and he shall answer those which I
[1:48:47] was wounded in the house of my friends."
[1:48:50] So, just to bring all of this together
[1:48:52] really quickly. Um, here we have this
[1:48:54] this timeline. I need to swap it out
[1:48:56] with one of the better ones from Sister
[1:48:58] Sue. But we we we we understand that
[1:49:01] we're going to go up at the rapture and
[1:49:03] we're going to be in the palace during
[1:49:05] this tribulation period time of three
[1:49:07] and a half years. But it's a tribulation
[1:49:09] period for the Gentiles, but also yes,
[1:49:11] sort of for the Jews. But it is that
[1:49:13] those two witnesses come back. What are
[1:49:15] they those two witnesses doing? They are
[1:49:17] doing to the Jews the same thing brother
[1:49:19] Brham has come and done to the gentile
[1:49:22] church to to prepare them for the coming
[1:49:26] of their Lord.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; And isn't that what the message was
[1:49:29] supposed to do?
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; To prepare them for the coming OF THE
[1:49:35] LORD. WHAT IS IT? THIS MESSAGE ISN'T
[1:49:37] ABOUT A BUNCH OF DOCTRINES THAT YOU NEED
[1:49:39] TO DO TO BE BETTER PENTECOSTALS. NO, IT
[1:49:42] IS A MESSAGE THAT IS COMING to present
[1:49:44] to you who Jesus Christ is that you
[1:49:47] might be like him at his coming. And the
[1:49:49] Jews, the the two witnesses will begin
[1:49:52] to do this to the Jews. AND THEN JESUS
[1:49:54] WILL COME AND DO WHAT? MAKE HIMSELF
[1:49:57] KNOWN to them before the seventh trumpet
[1:50:01] and the rapture OF THE 144,000. SO IN
[1:50:04] Revelation 11, you begin to see this
[1:50:07] last three and a half year period. Jesus
[1:50:09] is going to what is he coming TO DO TO
[1:50:11] THE JEWS. JUST LIKE JOSEPH making
[1:50:14] himself known to the brethren. This is
[1:50:16] what's happening to the Jews.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is going to come at the last
[1:50:22] days for the Jews and do what? Make
[1:50:25] himself known to his brethren. And
[1:50:27] they're going to be like, "What? You
[1:50:28] have you're the Messiah. Why do you have
[1:50:30] why do you have prince in your hand? Why
[1:50:32] do you have a mark in your side? WHAT'S
[1:50:33] GOING ON BECAUSE YOU REJECTED ME. BUT
[1:50:36] WHAT is really happening? He's making
[1:50:38] himself known to them and the and when
[1:50:41] he makes himself known to them,
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; they are redeemed.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Because think about this in the story of
[1:50:49] Joseph. Joseph, you know, they come and
[1:50:52] they're like, "Hey, Jacob, we need
[1:50:53] grain." They come to Joseph. Joseph, can
[1:50:56] you give us grain? Joseph gives them
[1:50:58] grain. They were going to die because,
[1:51:00] you know, there was a famine going on.
[1:51:02] And so they get grain from Joseph and
[1:51:03] and you know, well, are they redeemed?
[1:51:07] They have grain. They won't die.
[1:51:10] But are they redeemed?
[1:51:12] No.
[1:51:14] They go and, you know, but he does this
[1:51:17] test and he keeps Simeon. And they go
[1:51:19] back and they're like, "Hey, uh, we're
[1:51:20] running out of grain, Jacob. We're going
[1:51:22] to have to bring Benjamin." And finally
[1:51:24] he relents and they go back and
[1:51:26] Benjamin's there. They have a nice
[1:51:27] supper. There they are with Joseph. Are
[1:51:29] they redeemed? No. He gives them grain.
[1:51:32] Are they redeemed? No. What if he says,
[1:51:35] "You know what? These are my brothers,
[1:51:36] but I don't I I just, you know, I'm
[1:51:39] still kind of mad at them, but I don't
[1:51:40] want them to die, and I don't want my
[1:51:41] dad to die. I don't want Benjamin to
[1:51:43] die. So, what I'm going to do is I'm
[1:51:44] going to go to Pharaoh, and I'm going to
[1:51:45] say, Pharaoh, you know, um there's these
[1:51:47] 70 people from um the land of Canaan
[1:51:50] that I would like to put in Gan. Would
[1:51:52] that be okay with you?" And Pharaoh
[1:51:53] would be like, "Yeah, I mean um
[1:51:56] okay." Like, Joseph, you've never let us
[1:51:58] down before. This doesn't make sense.
[1:52:00] why this random 70 people,
[1:52:04] you know, and like, well, yeah, but it's
[1:52:05] just, I don't know, something I feel
[1:52:07] like we should do. Okay, Joseph
[1:52:10] gonna trust you. Are they redeemed?
[1:52:11] Well, they're in goan and they're going
[1:52:13] to survive the famine.
[1:52:15] They're not redeemed yet because at any
[1:52:18] point in time, Pharaoh could be like,
[1:52:19] "Look, these random 70 people are
[1:52:20] problem. Let's just, you know, let's
[1:52:22] just move them out. Let's we'll send
[1:52:23] them back to Canaan.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; They're not redeemed. They have no They
[1:52:27] have no assurance.
[1:52:30] Boy, I just caught this one. They have
[1:52:33] no assurance.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; They're just random 70 people in Egypt
[1:52:42] surviving off of what Joseph is giving
[1:52:44] them.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; But they have no identity that gives
[1:52:49] them an assurance that they'll stay
[1:52:50] there.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; But then, but then Joseph comes and he
[1:52:57] takes off his Egyptian garments. He
[1:52:59] stops speaking in Egyptian and he starts
[1:53:01] speaking into Hebrew and he says to
[1:53:03] them,"I am Joseph your brother."
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; And at that moment they are redeemed
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; because their identity with the one
[1:53:17] revealing himself to them is known. And
[1:53:21] now they're not random 70 people in
[1:53:23] Goan. They are the ch they are the kin
[1:53:27] to Joseph himself
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; and no one will take that from them
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; and this is what's happening in
[1:53:35] revelations 11. What a beautiful story.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; So what do you think is happening in
[1:53:40] Revelations chapter 10?
[1:53:43] Is it any different?
[1:53:45] Because you know we have people leaving
[1:53:47] this message or doubting what's going
[1:53:49] on. But I would just like to say that
[1:53:51] this absolutely makes sense. When we
[1:53:53] look at these things in parallel and
[1:53:55] begin to recognize like you can like if
[1:53:57] you walk away from this message, it's
[1:53:58] like what does the book of Revelation
[1:54:00] mean? IT LIKE I WHO knows
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; who KNOWS BUT THROUGH PROPHETIC INSIGHT,
[1:54:05] we begin to see and what we begin to see
[1:54:07] that's HAPPENING IN REVELATIONS 10 IS
[1:54:09] not just some man coming to make his
[1:54:11] ministry something great that PEOPLE
[1:54:13] WOULD FOLLOW. NO. BUT WHAT WE BEGIN TO
[1:54:15] SEE IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID WOULD HAPPEN
[1:54:18] HAS HAPPENED. AND CHRIST HAS CLOTHED
[1:54:21] WITH A CLOUD, A RAINBOW AT HIS FEET, HAS
[1:54:23] COME AND PRESENTED HIMSELF TO SOMEONE TO
[1:54:27] WHAT? TO A TO A BRIDE.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT NOT JUST TO A BRIDE. BECAUSE FOR
[1:54:32] A GIRL for for a girl to be a bride,
[1:54:35] THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE THAT COMES AND
[1:54:37] SAYS, "I'm a bridegroom."
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:54:44] I would always talk about like Zion, you
[1:54:46] know, before he got married, he's, "Hey,
[1:54:48] Dad, I'm going to get married in March,
[1:54:52] you know, maybe before he was dating
[1:54:53] Camille." It's like, "I'm going to get
[1:54:54] I'm going to get married in March." Oh,
[1:54:56] really? That's that's nice. You know,
[1:55:00] does she know?
[1:55:04] You know, it's
[1:55:05] there's a like I get that you want to be
[1:55:08] married, son, but there's a process,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:55:13] I you know what's so great, son, is that
[1:55:15] you've recognized your capability to be
[1:55:17] a bridegroom, to be a husband. That's
[1:55:20] wonderful. But there's a there's
[1:55:22] something you're going to have to do
[1:55:23] before you can actually be married to a
[1:55:25] a bride.
[1:55:28] And you're going to have to you're going
[1:55:29] to HAVE TO LOOK OUT THROUGH, you know,
[1:55:31] all of messageddom
[1:55:34] because under no circumstances should a
[1:55:36] believer ever marry an unbeliever. and
[1:55:38] you know and then you're going to have
[1:55:39] to select the ones in that that are
[1:55:41] actually true believers and that's going
[1:55:43] to be a fun process. But you know anyway
[1:55:45] we'll stop with the dating advice and
[1:55:46] we'll just continue on with what we're
[1:55:48] saying and and you know and and and you
[1:55:50] know and there's going to be this one
[1:55:52] and you're going to ah maybe and you're
[1:55:54] going to get to know her and then going
[1:55:55] to come to a place where finally you're
[1:55:57] like yeah this is the one and you know
[1:55:59] but you have to tell her.
[1:56:05] So, what you have to do is you have to
[1:56:06] this I hope this is helping you guys.
[1:56:08] So, what you're going to have to do is
[1:56:09] you're going to have to reveal yourself
[1:56:11] to her as a bridegroom.
[1:56:16] And you know, typically what that looks
[1:56:19] like is this.
[1:56:24] This is what revealing yourself as a
[1:56:26] bridegroom looks like.
[1:56:29] And then she,
[1:56:32] you know, has that reaction that you got
[1:56:34] on drone and five cameras and friends in
[1:56:37] the bushes and all of that, you know,
[1:56:39] and and and and you know, and what
[1:56:42] happens in that moment? She caught a
[1:56:45] revelation
[1:56:48] of what YOU WERE TRYING TO say
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; about who you were
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; with respect to who she is.
[1:56:58] What do YOU THINK? REVELATIONS CHAPTER
[1:57:00] 10 IS
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY CHRIST coming down revealing.
[1:57:06] No one no one had. THIS ISN'T BAPTIST
[1:57:08] DOCTRINE. NO ONE TALKS ABOUT BEING THE
[1:57:11] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST THOUGH IT'S THERE
[1:57:13] IN REVELATION. NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT.
[1:57:15] BUT HERE IN THIS LAST DAY BECAUSE GOD
[1:57:18] FULFILLED HIS WORD AND MANIFESTED
[1:57:20] REVELATIONS CHAPTER 10 AND IT HAS HAS
[1:57:23] absolutely happened. Christ has come
[1:57:26] down to reveal who he is and THAT HIS
[1:57:31] POSITION AS A BRIDEGROOM LOOKING. OH,
[1:57:34] it's just a it's just a little story
[1:57:37] about this bridegroom looking for a
[1:57:38] bride. No, IT'S NOT JUST A LITTLE STORY.
[1:57:41] IT IS THE STORY. This is the story of
[1:57:45] redemption. THIS IS WHAT GOD HAD IN HIS
[1:57:48] MIND FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:57:51] WORLD. AND WE ARE LIVING IN THE DAY OF
[1:57:53] HIS COMING. NOT JUST TO DIE FOR US AND
[1:57:55] PURCHASE THAT REDEMPTION, BUT TO COME
[1:57:58] AND REDEEM US BACK TO WHO HE ALWAYS
[1:58:00] MEANT FOR US TO BE WHEN WE WERE IN HIS
[1:58:03] MIND BEFORE the foundation of the world.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAD TO COME AND REVEAL HIMSELF AS
[1:58:10] A BRIDEGROOM BEFORE WE COULD EVER BE HIS
[1:58:13] BRIDE in that city.
[1:58:21] I could go on, but then we we better
[1:58:22] not.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; So, what's going on?
[1:58:30] He's making himself known.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; What is this message?
[1:58:38] He's making himself known.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; And if we, you know, and if we say this
[1:58:45] message is Christ,
[1:58:48] A lot of people struggle with that
[1:58:50] because they think that we're trying to
[1:58:51] equate Brother Brandham with Christ or
[1:58:53] that, you know, following a prophet with
[1:58:55] Christ. No, that's not what's being
[1:58:58] said. When we say this message is
[1:59:00] Christ, what we mean is is what God,
[1:59:04] you know, I love that song. I I didn't
[1:59:07] plan it. You know, my kids, they they
[1:59:09] sang Red Letter.
[1:59:12] How we needed those red letters.
[1:59:18] You know, it wouldn't bother me one bit.
[1:59:21] Oh, I don't have my message book in
[1:59:22] here. I need to get that over here. But
[1:59:23] if I had a message book and if I told
[1:59:25] you like, hey, wouldn't bother me one
[1:59:27] bit if all of this was red letters. I
[1:59:29] know that would stumble some people, but
[1:59:31] I just want you to understand that this
[1:59:33] this me like the reason that that that
[1:59:35] brother Joseph had the original the
[1:59:37] inspiration to call it voice of God
[1:59:38] recordings
[1:59:40] is because brother Brandham said, "I am
[1:59:42] God's voice to you
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; is because brother Brandham was the
[1:59:45] seventh angel on the ground at the time
[1:59:48] of his coming. The one it's all we're
[1:59:50] saying is is God HAD TO USE SOME GUY TO
[1:59:52] SAY IT. HE HE USED THAT GUY AND
[1:59:54] VINDICATED THAT guy
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; so that he could speak his truth to us
[1:59:59] that who he was.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; And it is like how do we leave it
[2:00:05] unplayed? HOW DO WE LEAVE IT UNLISTED to
[2:00:09] when this is the THING THAT IS PREPARING
[2:00:12] US FOR RAPTURING FAITH? WHY IS IT
[2:00:14] PREPARING US? BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING
[2:00:16] THROUGH WHAT'S BEING SAID THE IDENTITY
[2:00:19] OF HIM AS A BRIDEGROOM TO US AS HIS
[2:00:23] BRIDE. AND UNTIL YOU RECOGNIZE HE'S A
[2:00:26] BRIDEGROOM AND YOU PERSONALLY ARE BRIDE,
[2:00:30] YOU WILL NEVER BEGIN to make yourself
[2:00:33] ready. You will never begin to putting
[2:00:35] THE WEDDING GARMENT ON SO THAT YOU CAN
[2:00:38] BE SITTING THERE WAITING FOR THE WHEELS
[2:00:40] OF THAT BUCKBOARD AND THE SOUND OF THE
[2:00:42] HORSE'S HOOF TO BE COMING ON THE DAY
[2:00:44] APPOINTED. YOU'LL NEVER BEGIN THAT IF
[2:00:48] YOU HAVEN'T heard if if you haven't seen
[2:00:52] him doing this TO YOU.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; AND GOD DID THAT IN THIS REVELATION 10
[2:00:57] story. AND THAT IS this message.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; The whole point.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; The whole It's a beautiful little story
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; right there in the sixth seal right
[2:01:09] before the seventh.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Just a cute little western tale.
[2:01:15] No, it is the story.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; It is the story of redemption.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; So redemption is not to bring us to mere
[2:01:24] sinlessness.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Redemption is to bring us to being the
[2:01:28] in the in the fellowship that he always
[2:01:31] had intended that we would be with him.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Shall
[2:01:38] we go to prayer? Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:01:42] how amazing,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; how mighty, how wonderful, Lord Jesus,
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; that you would, Lord, that you would
[2:01:50] condescend, that you would come and as a
[2:01:53] man, and that you would even die on a
[2:01:55] cross for us. But, Father, that that was
[2:01:58] only one step in the whole plan. It was
[2:02:01] never your purpose to to merely die on a
[2:02:03] cross, that we would just believe that
[2:02:05] you did that, that we would be sinless.
[2:02:07] But then Lord, you wrote the book of
[2:02:09] Revelation which was the works of the
[2:02:12] church in the oncoming ages and how then
[2:02:14] the culmination would be of your entire
[2:02:17] purpose Lord. And we find ourselves
[2:02:20] living,
[2:02:21] oh Lord, what all ages from
[2:02:26] from the beginning of time till now has
[2:02:28] looked for
[2:02:30] is that redemption,
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; that restoration of being with you.
[2:02:35] Father, we are now living.
[2:02:39] Father, this can't just be mere story.
[2:02:42] This can't just be mere coincidence.
[2:02:44] Lord, this must be the divinely inspired
[2:02:48] word of God.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, and as your prophet would say that
[2:02:52] we now by God's grace have the perfect
[2:02:55] interpretation of the word of God with
[2:02:58] divine vindication, Lord, you have made
[2:03:01] yourself plain before us. Forgive us,
[2:03:04] Father, where we we don't look to it,
[2:03:06] where we don't value what you've given
[2:03:08] to us, Lord. Your word of promise that
[2:03:10] that that has started a clock to say, "I
[2:03:13] am coming back for you."
[2:03:16] Oh, come quickly is all we can say. For
[2:03:19] we make ourselves ready, Lord. We clothe
[2:03:23] oursselfves in your promise, Lord God.
[2:03:25] We clothe ourselves in the word of
[2:03:27] proclamation that you desire us to be
[2:03:30] your bride. And so, Father, we say yes,
[2:03:33] I am willing, oh God.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, anoint us to hear. Anoint us, Lord
[2:03:39] Jesus, to receive.
[2:03:42] Oh, Father, may may we be transfixed
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; by the revelation of what you have done
[2:03:48] in our day and who it means you are and
[2:03:52] who it means we are.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Bless us now, Lord. We ask in the name
[2:03:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Blessed be the name of
[2:04:01] the Lord.
[2:04:04] Sing a song, brother.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Draw me close to you.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Never let me go.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Me go.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; I lay it all down again.
[2:04:34] to hear you say that I'm your friend.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; You are my desire.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; My desire.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yes you are.
[2:04:50] No one else will do.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; No one else. No one else.
[2:04:58] Cuz nothing else can take your place
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; to feel the warmth of your grace.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Help me find the way.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Bring me back to you.
[2:05:30] You're all
[2:05:32] I want.
[2:05:38] You're all
[2:05:41] worth every
[2:05:44] day.
[2:05:46] You're all
[2:05:48] I want.
[2:05:53] Help me know you are near.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:06:03] Draw me close to you.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a love story.
[2:06:11] Never let me go.
[2:06:19] I lay it all down again.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; To hear you say that I
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; I'm your friend.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; You are my desire.
[2:06:44] No one else will will do
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; nothing else can take your place
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; to feel the warmth to feel your grace.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Help me find the way. Oh, that's this
[2:07:11] message.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's what he's given to us. He wants
[2:07:16] you to come. He wants to be with you.
[2:07:20] Hey,
[2:07:23] you're all I want.
[2:07:29] Oh, you're all I
[2:07:35] needed.
[2:07:38] You're all
[2:07:40] power.
[2:07:46] Help. We know you
[2:07:49] are near.
[2:07:54] Oh, you're all
[2:07:56] I want.
[2:08:02] You're all I ever needed.
[2:08:10] You're all
[2:08:12] how
[2:08:18] me know you are near.
[2:08:25] Help me know you are near. Help
[2:08:34] me know you are.
[2:08:42] Hallelujah.
[2:08:44] Hallelujah.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; How do we know
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; he's near?
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Is it because we feel
[2:08:54] the rush of the wind, the moving of the
[2:08:57] spirit? Is it Is it because we feel that
[2:09:00] And that's wonderful. And we love those
[2:09:02] times. And he comes and he vindicates
[2:09:04] his word. And he comes and he makes this
[2:09:06] word real. But how do we know he's near?
[2:09:09] We know because he said he was. How do
[2:09:12] we know that he even wants us to want
[2:09:16] him because he said he did? Is this song
[2:09:20] merely just our expression of feeling
[2:09:22] for him that Lord, you're so good, so we
[2:09:25] want you. Or is this is is this an
[2:09:28] expression of recognizing that he's
[2:09:30] actually said this first that he that
[2:09:33] that is what the expression of this word
[2:09:35] is that that's what the expression of
[2:09:37] this message is IS TO SAY I WANT you
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; I want you in relation
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD HELP ME TO KNOW YOU'RE
[2:09:48] NEAR. Well Lord you've already told me
[2:09:51] you're near. Lord if Lord I want more
[2:09:53] than just feeling. I want anchor. I want
[2:09:56] truth. I want revelation. I want it to
[2:10:00] be so deep on the inside of me that I am
[2:10:03] yours and that you are coming for me and
[2:10:06] that we will never be separate. That
[2:10:09] when the stormy clouds come, Lord, it is
[2:10:12] no sign of your disapproval, but it is
[2:10:15] just me growing into who you are. Lord,
[2:10:17] I want this so deep. I want this
[2:10:19] revelation TO HOLD ME. HOW ARE WE GOING
[2:10:21] TO GET THAT? HE GAVE US HIS WORD. HE
[2:10:24] SPOKE IT TO US. Faith cometh by hearing
[2:10:27] and hearing of the word OF GOD. HE GAVE
[2:10:29] US RAPTURING FAITH ON THESE MESSAGES.
[2:10:32] This message laying in these messages to
[2:10:35] bring us TO RAPTURING FAITH. WHAT IS
[2:10:37] THAT DOING BUT anchoring in OUR HEARTS
[2:10:40] OUR IDENTITY AS HIS BRIDE?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SAYS YOU'RE MY BRIDE,
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's why divorce is so
[2:10:53] terrible is because it's because it
[2:10:55] breaks down the fabric of the revelation
[2:10:57] that when God says you are my bride, it
[2:11:00] can it will never be revoked. It will
[2:11:02] never be taken away. He will marry you
[2:11:03] and never leave.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:11:09] that's assurance. That's knowledge.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; When when Joseph's brothers, it was
[2:11:15] revealed to him that that we are the
[2:11:17] BROTHERS OF THIS THE GUY IN CHARGE.
[2:11:20] NOTHING CAN TAKE that away.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; You are the bride of the guy in charge.
[2:11:25] YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. He
[2:11:28] doesn't believe in divorce. He will
[2:11:30] never put you away. He will He WILL
[2:11:32] NEVER TAKE IT AWAY.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; You can you can you can sit there and be
[2:11:36] anchored in his word and the knowledge
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; seated already
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; with him in heavenly places.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; This is who I am. And the only reason I
[2:11:51] KNOW THIS IS BECAUSE THE SEVENTH ANGEL
[2:11:53] WAS HERE AT THE TIME OF HIS coming
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; and God recorded it for me.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is to us,
[2:12:00] friends.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:12:05] thank God I heard.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Thank God I heard.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; So the next time you're thinking, God, I
[2:12:12] want to know that you're near.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Put on a tape. Press play on your app.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you can SING, YOU'RE YOU'RE ALL I
[2:12:21] WANT. You're all I've ever needed.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; I just I just need to know you're here.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; You know, maybe sometimes the bride
[2:12:33] would just want to be reminded. You
[2:12:36] know, we'd look back and oh, you know,
[2:12:38] there's a reason we record our our
[2:12:40] engagements these days. You know,
[2:12:42] because we can
[2:12:44] we can video them and now you can look
[2:12:47] back on those memories and oh those
[2:12:50] times was so wonderful. We can look back
[2:12:52] in that history and remember the time
[2:12:54] that he came and got me.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:00] Every morning on my way to work
[2:13:04] for 25 minutes,
[2:13:06] I'm reviewing
[2:13:09] him coming to me and saying, "I'm a
[2:13:12] bridegroom and you're my bride."
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; I I man, I just I can't help it. I'm a
[2:13:17] hopeless romantic. I just I just I just
[2:13:20] I just I need that in the morning. I
[2:13:22] need 25 minutes of just going, you know,
[2:13:24] I really love you. You know, I'm a
[2:13:26] pretty great guy and I like you, man.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's a beautiful way to start the day.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; This is church. This is how we know.
[2:13:38] This message is what reveals him to us.
[2:13:41] The mighty God unveiled before us as a
[2:13:44] bridegroom to a bride. I find my
[2:13:47] identity in him because he fulfilled his
[2:13:50] word and he sent us this message.
[2:13:55] So now let's sing. You're all
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; You're
[2:14:03] all I want.
[2:14:06] You're

[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:15:55] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:15:57] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:16:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[2:16:06] I think that song um I can't think of
[2:16:08] the name. He say it again. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:16:12] Sing that one.
[2:16:15] I need more
[2:16:19] of
[2:16:21] you.
[2:16:26] That's the way it's got to be.
[2:16:32] fighting for
[2:16:37] you
[2:16:41] till there's no room
[2:16:45] left in me.
[2:16:50] All those wastes,
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; hours and minutes,
[2:16:56] they're yours now. From the start to the
[2:17:02] finish,
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; I need more.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, I need more
[2:17:08] of you
[2:17:11] in me.
[2:17:22] I need more.
[2:17:28] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Fill me with nothing.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Fill me with more of you, Lord.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; More of
[2:17:42] you.
[2:17:47] Till your love and the world could have
[2:17:51] the rest.
[2:17:55] I could never get
[2:17:59] enough
[2:18:02] of your grace, your peace, your warmth,
[2:18:05] and your love. I need more.
[2:18:16] I need more
[2:18:18] of you.
[2:18:22] Jesus
[2:18:30] living in me.
[2:18:37] Hallelujah.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:42] Let's just stand.
[2:18:45] Amen.
[2:18:50] It's just been so wonderful.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; To be in the house of the Lord.
[2:18:56] And you know,
[2:18:59] it's I can just say I say amen. I
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; That's it's where we stand.
[2:19:07] And you know, one thing that brother
[2:19:09] Brandham he told us and and I I wanted
[2:19:12] to say it like this. You know, you don't
[2:19:14] brother Brandham described the message.
[2:19:17] There's so many different analogies
[2:19:19] that's given and he'll he'll use the
[2:19:23] analogy where we've all seen pictures
[2:19:28] and you're looking at a picture
[2:19:31] and there's something inside of that
[2:19:33] picture and you have to look at it long
[2:19:36] enough. You know, it's like it's like
[2:19:39] when you look at the FedEx symbol. All
[2:19:41] we see is FedEx, but there's something
[2:19:44] inside of that symbol. If you ever look
[2:19:46] at it again, there's actually a symbol
[2:19:47] in there.
[2:19:49] When you look at the Dunkin Donuts sign,
[2:19:52] there's actually a symbol inside of
[2:19:54] there. A lot of times we just look at
[2:19:55] this. We just look at, oh, I I see that.
[2:19:58] But there's actually a number wrote in
[2:19:59] there.
[2:20:02] And that's the way it is with many
[2:20:03] different things. But brother Brandham
[2:20:04] will liken that in trying to do God a
[2:20:06] service. He takes us one of the last
[2:20:08] messages that he preaches. He says the
[2:20:11] message that's how it is. There is a
[2:20:15] message within here and that's Christ.
[2:20:18] That's who the message is. That's who's
[2:20:21] being revealed. And he said it like
[2:20:23] this. It's like whenever you you know
[2:20:25] what I'm talking about with those
[2:20:26] pictures. As soon as you see that in
[2:20:29] that picture like that arrow in that
[2:20:30] FedEx sign, you cannot unsee it.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's why brother Bram says
[2:20:37] when you once see this message, you
[2:20:40] can't see nothing else.
[2:20:45] So, I'd say it in this way. You know,
[2:20:48] we've all been in things. You know,
[2:20:50] sometimes
[2:20:52] people can just be talking to you and
[2:20:54] they're saying this to you and saying
[2:20:55] this to you and and you either you
[2:20:58] either got to be honest because you
[2:21:00] don't want to feel dumb
[2:21:02] and say, "No, I don't see it. you're out
[2:21:04] in seems like you're out in left field
[2:21:06] or I'm looking at this picture and you
[2:21:09] can be all be standing and the curator
[2:21:11] of the museum is pointing things out and
[2:21:13] you're sitting there and everybody's
[2:21:14] like, "Whoa,
[2:21:16] wow my." Now, there could be some of
[2:21:20] them wo and wows and my that they're
[2:21:22] just under peer pressure.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; The next PERSON IS LIKE, "WOW." AND
[2:21:29] THEY'RE DOING WOW. THEY REALLY DON'T SEE
[2:21:31] IT, BUT IT'S WOW. It's
[2:21:34] We call that fear of missing out. Now
[2:21:36] it's called peer pressure.
[2:21:39] Personal revelation
[2:21:41] is not peer pressure.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; What God was speaking today
[2:21:46] is to even if you don't see it in that
[2:21:50] way
[2:21:52] to where it's come to really affect your
[2:21:54] life,
[2:21:56] ask him. Say, "Lord,
[2:22:01] make yourself known to me.
[2:22:04] Reveal yourself, Lord." That's why the
[2:22:07] prophet said, "Let us pray and ask God
[2:22:10] for a fresh revelation,
[2:22:14] lifegiving,
[2:22:16] and then by that revelation become
[2:22:20] the living word made manifest."
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you once see it, you can't see
[2:22:25] nothing else. And when you see it, you
[2:22:28] actually see who you are and what God's
[2:22:32] ordained you to be.
[2:22:35] That's powerful, friends.
[2:22:38] It's powerful. What do we want to do? We
[2:22:39] want to embrace deity.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Embrace the God who is revealing himself
[2:22:46] of who we really are.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I just I say that in
[2:22:52] that way that I would not be too proud
[2:22:56] to say, "God,
[2:23:00] make yourself known to me in that way."
[2:23:03] Because I I'll just say it, friends, if
[2:23:05] if what if if the message is not a
[2:23:08] relationship and the message if all you
[2:23:11] can see is a code of conduct and laws,
[2:23:14] you're not seeing it.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You're not seeing it. And I
[2:23:18] don't say that to put anybody down. I'm
[2:23:20] just trying to say that's not what this
[2:23:21] message is. This message was not a code
[2:23:25] of conduct. This message is Jesus Christ
[2:23:29] being revealed. And I I think it's
[2:23:31] something that we could take home from
[2:23:32] this message right here
[2:23:35] and say, "Lord,
[2:23:38] make yourself known to me."
[2:23:40] And I think every one of us have things
[2:23:42] to pray about because when when it's
[2:23:45] revealed,
[2:23:46] that's not the summit. That's the
[2:23:49] beginning of Christ in your life.
[2:23:53] Because the stature of a perfect man,
[2:23:56] that's it begins with a new birth and
[2:23:58] then it comes all the way up.
[2:24:02] And so it's Christ
[2:24:05] being formed in our lives. I just I this
[2:24:10] is why to me friends this is why listen
[2:24:13] it's why you can't tell somebody what to
[2:24:15] do or you need to do this and you need
[2:24:18] it has to be God reveal himself
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; if God doesn't reveal himself which he
[2:24:23] wants to you know how brother you know
[2:24:25] what brother M says he wants to reveal
[2:24:28] himself
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; he wants to make himself known he wants
[2:24:35] all to see
[2:24:37] I just take hold of that here this
[2:24:38] morning and say, "God,
[2:24:41] just let me see it in that way."
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Let me see it like when I look at that
[2:24:45] FedEx sign. When I look at them that
[2:24:47] them BaskinRobin sign, that Dunkin Don,
[2:24:49] let me see it, Lord. Let me see the
[2:24:51] message within this message.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Because I don't want to just see words.
[2:24:57] I want to see you.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; So beautiful, isn't it? Hallelujah.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's why the coming of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:07] can only come through the revealing of
[2:25:09] his name.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost cannot be delivered
[2:25:13] through a Pentecostal doctrine. It can't
[2:25:15] come through Baptist doctrine. The Holy
[2:25:16] Ghost can only come as he reveals
[2:25:19] himself to be the same yesterday, today,
[2:25:22] and forever.
[2:25:25] He's God, and he changes not. Don't you
[2:25:28] love him?
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Don't you appreciate his mercy and his
[2:25:31] grace here?
[2:25:32] Amen. Here this morning. Amen. Brother
[2:25:34] Trevor, thank you. Thank you for
[2:25:36] yielding to the Lord.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just so appreciate it.
[2:25:41] So appreciate it.
[2:25:44] Amen.
[2:25:45] Amen. Amen. What a what a privilege it's
[2:25:48] been. And Amen. The whole the whole
[2:25:51] weekend's just been a just a wonderful
[2:25:53] wonderful weekend. Amen. In the word of
[2:25:56] God. Amen. We're so thankful for God's
[2:25:58] grace. Amen. Among us. Amen. And let's
[2:26:01] just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:26:03] And I think we could just all just even
[2:26:07] here just give thanks to the Lord.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe this will be a moment that you ask
[2:26:11] God, Lord, I I want to see it in that
[2:26:13] way that it affect my life and take us
[2:26:17] deeper, Lord. Heavenly Father,
[2:26:20] thank you for your grace, Lord.
[2:26:23] What a privilege it is, Lord, that
[2:26:28] in this hour that God, that you would
[2:26:31] speak
[2:26:32] and you would speak to our hearts.
[2:26:36] Lord Jesus,
[2:26:39] it isn't anything that we have done to
[2:26:41] merit
[2:26:43] nothing at all. But Father, it's your
[2:26:46] grace that's has broke forth upon our
[2:26:50] hearts,
[2:26:51] melding down our will,
[2:26:54] bringing us to surrender. Lord, it's
[2:26:57] it's all your work. Lord, we have
[2:27:00] absolutely not one thing to do with it
[2:27:05] except surrender.
[2:27:08] Oh God, what an awesome choice that's
[2:27:11] given to us, Lord, in your presence.
[2:27:15] I pray, Father, Lord, for each and every
[2:27:18] one of our hearts here this morning,
[2:27:22] God, how endearing you are with your
[2:27:25] presence among us.
[2:27:28] I pray, Father,
[2:27:30] as we would, Lord, prepare to leave from
[2:27:32] the presence of one another,
[2:27:35] dear God, from this building.
[2:27:38] But may we take, Lord, the words that
[2:27:40] have been spoken. And I pray, Father,
[2:27:45] oh God, by the revelation of God,
[2:27:49] become the living word made manifest.
[2:27:53] Lord Jesus, I believe, Lord, I'm
[2:27:56] standing, Lord, among believers, honest
[2:27:59] hearts, that Lord Jesus, we're not here
[2:28:02] to ooh or awe because somebody else ooed
[2:28:06] or a we're not trying to fit in with a
[2:28:08] group. Your prophet told us it's not a
[2:28:11] collective revelation. It's not a group
[2:28:14] revelation. It's an individual
[2:28:17] revelation.
[2:28:19] So Lord, your desire, we've heard it
[2:28:21] over and over through the message here
[2:28:24] this morning. Your desire is to make
[2:28:27] yourself known to us to bring such an
[2:28:31] assurance, such a stability in our life,
[2:28:34] a real rest in our hearts. I pray father
[2:28:38] for each and everyone
[2:28:41] Lord God let it be Lord Jesus and may
[2:28:45] Lord I pray as we continue
[2:28:48] to grow more and more and more in your
[2:28:52] likeness Lord feeding on this word the
[2:28:56] unfailing body word of the son of man
[2:29:00] this word Lord is changing us Lord
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Lord we're so thankful dear God, bless
[2:29:08] your children as we go our separate
[2:29:10] ways. I pray for brother Trevor and the
[2:29:12] Eman family, Lord, as they would travel
[2:29:15] back home. I pray that God that you
[2:29:17] would bless their trip going back home.
[2:29:20] May the angels of God just take their
[2:29:22] position, Lord, once again. Guide them
[2:29:25] home safely. And may you pour back into
[2:29:28] them, Lord God, as they have poured out,
[2:29:31] Father, this weekend for us, Lord. We
[2:29:35] thank you, Father, for Brother Trevor.
[2:29:37] Thank you for his family. Thank you,
[2:29:39] Lord, for the gift, the friendship. Oh,
[2:29:41] God. We appreciate, Lord, every one of
[2:29:44] your gifts. We love you. We thank you,
[2:29:48] Lord. We ask your blessing and that you
[2:29:50] would just go with us. And Lord, we pray
[2:29:52] God for even as was prayed here earlier
[2:29:55] as brother Shane was min me ministering
[2:29:57] Lord for sister Rachel Atkins Lord that
[2:30:00] God that you would so guide the hands of
[2:30:03] the doctors and the surgeons Lord and
[2:30:06] Father may your presence just fill that
[2:30:09] room dear God and Father just Lord Jesus
[2:30:12] bring such a strength Lord in into her
[2:30:15] body. I pray Father through recovery
[2:30:18] Lord. Father, we ask these things all in
[2:30:21] the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen
[2:30:24] and amen. Amen. Why don't you turn and
[2:30:27] shake hands with somebody as you're
[2:30:28] being dismissed? Say, "God bless you."
[2:30:32] Amen. God bless you. Go ahead.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; It's a lovely,
[2:30:37] lovely name.
[2:30:40] The name of Jesus.
[2:30:46] It's a lovely,
[2:30:48] lovely name.
[2:30:51] The name I love.
[2:30:56] It's a lovely,
[2:30:59] lovely name.
[2:31:01] The name of Jesus.
[2:31:07] It's a lovely,
[2:31:10] lovely, lovely,
[2:31:12] lovely day.
[2:31:17] It's a preious,
[2:31:20] precious name, the name of Jesus.
[2:31:28] Oh, it's a preious,
[2:31:31] precious name,
[2:31:33] the name of God.
[2:31:38] Oh, it's a preious,
[2:31:41] precious name.
[2:31:43] the name of Jesus.
[2:31:48] Oh, it's a preious,
[2:31:51] precious, precious,
[2:31:54] precious name.
[2:31:59] It's a holy,
[2:32:01] holy name.
[2:32:04] The name of Jesus.
[2:32:09] It's a holy,
[2:32:12] holy name. The name I love.
[2:32:19] Oh, it's a holy,
[2:32:22] holy name. The name of Jesus.
[2:32:29] It's a holy,
[2:32:32] holy, holy,
[2:32:34] holy.
[2:32:40] In moments
[2:32:42] like these,
[2:32:45] I sing out a song.
[2:32:51] Sing out
[2:32:54] song
[2:32:56] to Jesus.
[2:33:01] Moments
[2:33:03] like these.
[2:33:06] I lift up
[2:33:09] my hands.
[2:33:11] I lift up
[2:33:14] my hands to
[2:33:17] the Lord.
[2:33:20] Sing.
[2:33:53] I
[2:33:55] love
[2:33:58] you
[2:34:02] in moments
[2:34:05] like these.
[2:34:08] I sing out
[2:34:10] a song.
[2:34:13] I sing out
[2:34:16] a song
[2:34:18] to Jesus
[2:34:23] in moments
[2:34:25] thy knees.
[2:34:28] I lift up
[2:34:31] my hands.
[2:34:34] I lift up
[2:34:36] my hands to the Lord.
[2:34:42] Sing
[2:35:03] me.
[2:35:14] I
[2:35:17] love
[2:35:19] you.
[2:35:23] You didn't have to open my eyes.
[2:35:28] Could have easily passed me by
[2:35:33] for the age I was living in. Wretched,
[2:35:38] broken, and blind.
[2:35:42] Then I heard recognizing your day,
[2:35:46] serpent seed and perfect faith
[2:35:51] of preaching the message of grace. Lord,
[2:35:56] I thank you.
[2:36:00] And I just want to thank you, Lord,
[2:36:05] for letting me hear your word.
[2:36:10] What have I done to deserve the stories
[2:36:14] revealed in me?
[2:36:18] Thanks for that special life.
[2:36:23] When I saw your glorious life, you face
[2:36:28] to face with me tonight.
[2:36:38] Not even in my wildest dreams
[2:36:43] did I think I see such things
[2:36:47] as the coming of the Lord. Rapture
[2:36:53] mystery
[2:36:56] I have heard but now I see
[2:37:01] not in simplicity.
[2:37:05] Spoken word is the original scene. Lord,
[2:37:10] I thank you.
[2:37:14] And I just want to thank you, Lord,
[2:37:18] for letting me hear your word.
[2:37:23] What have I done to deserve such glories
[2:37:27] revealed to me?
[2:37:31] Thanks for that special life.
[2:37:36] made a song glorious
[2:37:40] face to face with eternal life. Lord, I
[2:37:45] thank you.
[2:37:48] Lord, thank you for that special night
[2:37:53] when I saw you light
[2:37:57] face to face with eternal life before I
