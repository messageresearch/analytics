[13:52] hallelujah hallelujah amen let's turn to
[13:58] Ephesians 6 this morning a man so
[14:01] thankful for God's Amazing Grace good to
[14:05] have each and every one of you here
[14:06] visitors that we have with us this
[14:08] morning may the Lord bless you may God
[14:10] bless each and every one of you
[14:26] I heard where they had where the bill
[14:29] had a birthday now you know brother bill
[14:33] was born on February 29 so every four
[14:37] years you have a leap year so if you do
[14:41] the math and you know would divide it
[14:44] out he's somewhere you know around in
[14:47] there maybe I don't know maybe he's
[14:49] close to 20 don't look a day over 17 we
[14:59] certainly love you brother bill
[15:01] appreciate you we want to have a special
[15:15] prayer here this morning
[15:17] brother Richard had given this to me and
[15:18] they it wasn't in in the prayer request
[15:24] basket back there I guess at the time
[15:27] but we want to have prayer for his son
[15:31] Joshua and Jamie that's the father and
[15:34] mother of little Ileana and and makai
[15:39] their son the Richard was riding on here
[15:43] lead they had got together with them at
[15:45] Rachel's house yesterday evening they
[15:49] were there in body but not in spirit
[15:52] they're hurting very bad which the only
[15:58] thing that probably I know some of you
[16:00] brother bill sister Mary there might be
[16:01] some others that maybe have had a loss
[16:05] too into this same connection but we all
[16:08] have experienced loss some of us in
[16:10] different degrees and we were very much
[16:13] aware of the waves that come
[16:17] at first those waves are so they're so
[16:21] there's so much and I myself and my
[16:24] heart I can't imagine what it would be
[16:26] of that of a child because with my dad
[16:29] you know my dad was my buddy but yet
[16:32] there were times believe it or not even
[16:34] though we live next door to one another
[16:36] I didn't see my dad until I got into the
[16:39] office here sometimes on a Thursday
[16:42] night and so you know it was you already
[16:45] had your own family and you're still
[16:46] going so it wasn't like you're there
[16:48] every day or someone you're caring for
[16:51] but I think of that and I'm sure you
[16:54] have too and we just want to keep them
[16:56] in prayer and really just just take it
[17:00] on our hearts because as we mentioned
[17:05] there'll be I did mention this obviously
[17:08] at the funeral service but I thought
[17:10] about this very much and for those
[17:13] that's had loved ones passed away
[17:14] there's always going to be a first
[17:16] there'll be a first birthday the first
[17:19] Thanksgiving a first Christmas there'll
[17:21] be a lot of firsts there'll be a first
[17:23] family reunion everything a lot of
[17:25] firsts that are without them and so we
[17:30] just we really need to keep them in
[17:32] prayer because we're Joshua and Jamie
[17:36] are at they do not have that hope that
[17:40] you and I have and so that they they
[17:46] need the help of the Lord and I would
[17:49] say it like this that God would minister
[17:51] to them a comfort and a protection to
[17:54] keep the enemy at bay
[18:01] I believe we've gotten the word of the
[18:03] Lord to keep the enemy at bay that the
[18:07] Lord Jesus himself would go right there
[18:10] and to deal with their hearts let him
[18:14] know he is the comforter let him know
[18:19] that he cares
[18:24] this just bow our heads Heavenly Father
[18:30] our hearts Lord as an assembly this Lord
[18:36] the need and the prayers Lord it's been
[18:39] before us continually Lord not just in
[18:44] prayer meeting Thursday nights and
[18:46] Sundays but God upon the hearts of your
[18:47] children Lord in this moment and
[18:51] throughout this time even from the time
[18:54] they're in may as a people Lord it
[18:58] became our child
[19:01] it became Lord Jesus as many times we'd
[19:04] pray our little darling Lord and dear
[19:07] God the older Lord is we're not the
[19:10] father and the mother but we carried
[19:12] this burden in prayer standing with
[19:14] brother Richard and sister Maria
[19:15] standing with the family Lord and Lord
[19:18] they're in need right now Lord there's
[19:22] no way in my heart that I could Lord say
[19:25] that that I understand to that level our
[19:29] Lord as far as sympathy but we can have
[19:32] empathy Lord some Lord that God have
[19:35] experienced it Lord are able to move
[19:38] Lord into that realm of of intercessory
[19:40] prayer Lord God Lord in a greater
[19:43] measure than then Lord many of us but I
[19:45] believe it on my heart that Lord is your
[19:48] children we're praying as a body Lord
[19:51] and God whatever vessel that you would
[19:54] use whatever prayer we believe that God
[19:56] that it's the prayers all together Lord
[19:58] that are offered up as we read in the
[20:00] Book of Revelations Lord there was not
[20:02] one prayer distinct from another but
[20:04] every one of the prayers that had been
[20:06] prayed Lord was offered up together Lord
[20:08] and father were just Lord coming to you
[20:11] Lord as
[20:12] priests that have been the Lord redeemed
[20:14] by the blood of the Lamb Lord and we
[20:17] offer Lord God unto you this morning and
[20:19] asked that you administer Lord in a
[20:22] special way to Joshua and to Jamie God
[20:26] were praying Lord that God there would
[20:28] be a shield of protection Lord that
[20:30] father that you would Lord protect them
[20:33] during this time of grieving Lord a time
[20:35] when something Lord so great as this
[20:37] Lord as your prophet would speak to us
[20:39] Lord in the message from that time to
[20:42] know that things like this GOG it
[20:44] consoled drive people Lord Lord to do
[20:48] certain things but we Lord are claiming
[20:50] O God a promise Lord and we ask God for
[20:53] your divine protection Lord over their
[20:55] lives and over their hearts Lord I pray
[20:59] God that Lord that through that under
[21:02] that protection that you would deal with
[21:04] their hearts Lord you know how to reach
[21:07] their hearts Lord that you would reveal
[21:09] yourself Lord that you are the one Lord
[21:12] Oh God who can give them a peace Lord

[21:41] one of your children Lord we pray as
[21:44] well Lord from Makai Oh God that your
[21:47] protection upon his life Oh God and I
[21:50] pray Heavenly Father that Lord you would
[21:52] deal with his heart as well Lord Lord
[21:55] we're looking to you Lord in a special
[21:57] way Lord and we believe these things
[22:00] Lord we ask it now Lord in the name of
[22:04] Jesus Christ amen amen
[22:09] praise the Lord can you say praise the
[22:13] Lord maybe for sake of time this morning
[22:18] let's just go to one verse of scripture
[22:20] in Ephesians 6
[22:23] we're speaking of the picking on the
[22:25] whole armour of God which is the full
[22:27] Word of God which is the full life of
[22:30] God amen which is to be born again is to
[22:33] have the Holy Spirit where Christ is
[22:36] seated in power in our life and so
[22:40] notice in verse 17 is where we want to
[22:42] go this morning and take the helmet of
[22:47] salvation and those and the sword of the
[22:51] Spirit which is the word of God I want
[22:55] you to notice how these are wrote in the
[22:58] scriptures you will see that all of this
[23:01] armament it comes in the complete
[23:05] package of the Holy Ghost but yet God
[23:08] would point out to us as in the manner
[23:12] that we are to take it use it let us
[23:15] know what it's about and notice he would
[23:17] say we already have the helmet of
[23:20] salvation but it would say take the
[23:22] helmet of salvation this is a great need
[23:25] for our lives take the helmet of
[23:29] salvation god bless you as you're being
[23:31] seated I want to just jump right in here
[23:34] to this scripture this morning and
[23:37] looking at this part of our armor we
[23:39] truly the-the-the-the desire that we
[23:44] would have in our hearts is that the
[23:45] lord as david would say in the
[23:48] scriptures that the Lord teaches my
[23:52] hands to war in another place David
[23:55] would say he teaches my fingers to fight
[23:59] we certainly need the leadership of the
[24:02] Lord and we need his direction and
[24:04] instruction in our life and I look at
[24:07] this thought on the helmet of salvation
[24:08] and we know that the helmet itself is
[24:12] that which would cover over it covers
[24:16] over the head it covers over the mind
[24:18] and when we look at this I want to just
[24:22] take this this direction here this
[24:24] morning as the Lord has as just-so
[24:26] pressed on my heart and to recognize in
[24:29] Isaiah 59 15
[24:32] where it speaks of how that our Lord
[24:35] Jesus himself when God came down and
[24:39] dwelt in a body of flesh he himself hell
[24:42] had with on him
[24:44] this same armour verse 15 it says yay
[24:48] truth faileth and he that departed from
[24:52] evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord
[24:55] saw it and it displeased him that there
[24:58] was no judgment and when we look at this
[25:03] within the scripture this this scripture
[25:05] you can bring this color over to
[25:06] revelations 5 and and so forth we're
[25:09] seeing truth faileth and when when truth
[25:12] when when as it says truth is faileth
[25:14] and it displeased him that there was no
[25:17] judgment because the scripture said that
[25:20] at a time has come that judgment must
[25:22] begin in the house of God is to be able
[25:25] to lift what is upon the life of of the
[25:30] people and put it back on the one the
[25:34] accuser from the beginning there's got
[25:37] to be one to do that and the law could
[25:40] not do it man could not do it but at God
[25:42] becoming flesh verse 16 and he saw look
[25:46] at this and he saw that there was no man
[25:49] and wondered that there was no
[25:51] intercessor therefore his arm brought
[25:55] salvation unto him and his righteousness
[25:57] it sustained him now would add this in
[26:00] verse 17 for he put on righteousness as
[26:04] a breastplate and an helmet of salvation
[26:09] upon his head he's talking about the
[26:12] Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ and he put
[26:15] on the garments of vengeance for
[26:18] clothing and was clad with zeal as a
[26:22] cloak verse 18 according to their deeds
[26:26] accordingly he will repay fury to his
[26:29] adversaries recompense to his enemies to
[26:32] the islands he will repay recompense so
[26:35] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[26:37] from the West and his glory from the
[26:39] rising of the Sun when the enemy shall
[26:42] come in like a flood the Spirit of the
[26:44] Lord shall lift up a stand
[26:46] against him and the Redeemer shall come
[26:49] to Zion and unto them that turned from
[26:52] transgression in Jacob saith the Lord as
[26:55] for me this is my covenant with them
[26:57] saith the Lord my spirit that is upon
[27:00] thee and my words which I have put in
[27:03] thy mouth shall not depart out of thy
[27:06] mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed
[27:08] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[27:10] saith the Lord from henceforth and
[27:13] forever now what here what we've just
[27:17] read a portion here in this of the
[27:20] scripture it has dealt with God already
[27:24] seen the need remember before the
[27:26] foundation of the world and Isaiah
[27:28] remember Isaiah being caught up and
[27:31] seeing it on Isaiah 53 he speaks under
[27:34] inspiration and everything that is
[27:36] spoken is that is rendered in a past
[27:39] tense he was wounded for our
[27:42] transgressions he was bruised for our
[27:45] iniquities because you see it was
[27:48] already settled from the mind of God
[27:50] what we are witnessing is the unfolding
[27:53] of God's mind of his heart of his word
[27:56] even in this time in this hour and when
[28:00] we look at this in the scripture here
[28:02] you find just in these allotments of
[28:04] Scripture there is a purpose and if I
[28:07] can say it like this when he came he
[28:10] comes to finish what he's already
[28:13] finished I said he comes to finish what
[28:18] he's already finished his finishing is
[28:23] bringing to pass what has already
[28:25] finished his salvation is solid it
[28:31] doesn't stop with the Gentile bride for
[28:34] out of zion shall de delivery come it
[28:37] reaches back over to the Jews in the
[28:40] revealing of his power which is the
[28:43] opening of the fountain in the house of
[28:45] David and it sets forth the Millennium
[28:47] where death is rendered conquered
[28:49] manifestly put underfoot and issues in a
[28:53] new heaven and a new earth a complete
[28:56] restoration it continues to
[28:59] unfold these scriptures I read is a
[29:01] continual unfolding he came here with
[29:05] righteousness as a breastplate and a
[29:08] helmet of salvation the message of
[29:11] Malachi for the prophet of God that was
[29:14] given in this hour is the message of the
[29:17] new birth for the elect for the Jews and
[29:21] for the earth it's the announcing birth
[29:25] pains are at hand so to think of it
[29:29] let's look here as he came with the
[29:32] helmet of salvation let's look at the
[29:35] the approach and how his life was in
[29:38] Luke 4 verse 18 he said the Spirit of
[29:41] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[29:44] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[29:48] poor he has sent me to heal the
[29:50] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[29:52] the captives and recovering of sight to
[29:55] the blind to set at liberty them that
[29:57] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[30:00] year of the Lord this was already wrote
[30:05] in Isaiah 61 remember Jesus the
[30:09] fulfillment of God's Word is God
[30:11] fulfilling through the lives through the
[30:15] life of the Lord Jesus through the lives
[30:17] of his of his people he fulfills his
[30:20] word and that's the greatest thing that
[30:22] we can ask for is God to fulfill his
[30:25] word and to think of it these were not
[30:28] just random scriptures that were being
[30:30] pulled out but when that scroll was
[30:33] delivered to him the Bible said he found
[30:35] where it was written
[30:37] he knew the scripture in Isaiah but
[30:40] we're here what it was the inspiration
[30:42] of the hour that was sealed in that part
[30:46] of the scripture that inspiration when
[30:49] that word was opened that inspiration
[30:51] came and anointed him whom the word was
[30:55] speaking of and so he could only speak
[30:58] what the word spoke matthew 1:21 and she
[31:03] shall bring forth a son and thou shalt
[31:06] call his name Jesus for he shall save he
[31:11] people from their sins not in their sins
[31:16] from their sins very important points he
[31:20] doesn't say the end he saves from he
[31:23] saves his says salvation of the Lord it
[31:26] is to take from the condition where a
[31:29] person is that saving is to take from
[31:31] where a person is and to transport them
[31:34] how does he do that he loosens us from
[31:37] the tie of that all nature through and
[31:40] by the birth of the Holy Ghost in our
[31:44] life Luke 2:14 and he said unto them how
[31:51] is it that you sought me now here he is
[31:53] young boy 12 years old father didn't
[32:00] even do well in him at the time no
[32:03] earthly wisdom of his own but notice
[32:06] what's fake what's fake out of him is
[32:09] the representation and the identity of
[32:11] who he was whis you not that I must be
[32:15] about my father's business I want you to
[32:18] catch these words I must be about my
[32:22] father's business John 5:17 jesus
[32:26] answered them and said my father worketh
[32:29] hitherto and I work he would go on to
[32:34] say in verse 19 verily verily I say unto
[32:36] you the son can do nothing of himself
[32:38] but what he seeth the father do for what
[32:41] things soever he doeth these also doeth
[32:44] the son likewise remember Jesus alive
[32:49] among the Pharisees these guys could
[32:52] quote the law they could quote the
[32:53] Psalms they could quote the prophets but
[32:55] Jesus his life was a mystery to them you
[33:00] know why they knew all of that but they
[33:02] did not know the god of Moses and even
[33:08] with those who were waiting there were
[33:11] many who were waiting that they were in
[33:13] a condition that would seem hopeless but
[33:18] it was not a condition that was hopeless
[33:22] because he was coming
[33:23] to bring deliverance as a matter of fact
[33:26] the purpose and the focus of the
[33:28] ministry was to bind up the
[33:30] brokenhearted was to set at liberty them
[33:33] that are bound wants to release captives
[33:36] that had been hold and this was the
[33:38] whole burden there that was poured out
[33:41] in the inspiration notice he says in
[33:43] John 9 for I must work the works of him
[33:48] that sent me while it's day the night
[33:52] cometh when no man can work you catch
[33:55] that I must work the works of him as
[33:58] long as I'm in the world I am the light
[34:01] of the world let me just say it like
[34:03] this
[34:03] nothing could deter him from the purpose
[34:07] even his own self are you with me even
[34:14] his own will could not deter him from
[34:19] the will of God he was crawled in a body
[34:23] of flesh you know the body of flesh was
[34:26] garments of vengeance the enemy looked
[34:30] at it and the scripture tells us there
[34:33] were no beauty that they should desire
[34:34] the enemy looked Satanist looked em said
[34:36] just like Abel you know I got Abel just
[34:39] like Ezekiel I got them what he didn't
[34:40] know this one is clothed with garments
[34:43] of vengeance but it is not how the world
[34:47] looks at vengeance he was coming with
[34:49] vengeance to take care of that sinful
[34:52] nature that had come about because of
[34:55] the fall he came and he donned himself
[34:58] with the body he made in the likeness of
[35:01] sinful flesh what was that garments of
[35:03] vengeance
[35:06] he came with business on his mind I
[35:12] can't do nothing now I got business on
[35:15] my mind
[35:23] hallelujah he was so subjected to feel
[35:27] all that we feel and deal with and he
[35:30] overcame his will
[35:33] by surrendering and subjecting himself
[35:35] to death in humility not begrudgingly
[35:41] verse 37 of John 18 you see this is what
[35:44] this this what I'm reading is the effect
[35:47] of the helmet of salvation the direction
[35:52] the leadership John 18:37 Pilate said
[35:57] unto Him are thou a king then jesus
[35:59] answered thou sayest that I'm a king to
[36:02] this end was I born and for this cause
[36:06] came I into the world that I should bear
[36:09] witness unto the truth and every one
[36:12] that is of the truth heareth my voice
[36:16] even standing in the midst of judgment
[36:19] Hall all the way through it wasn't all
[36:22] of a sudden where the purpose just
[36:23] kicked in his life it was it was a
[36:26] housed it was moved with the purpose
[36:30] when you looked at the life of the Lord
[36:32] Jesus it was a life as we just took a
[36:34] few selective scriptures here to show
[36:38] you what he was occupied with was not
[36:40] people's opinions of him people's
[36:43] thoughts of him although they wanted to
[36:45] give their opinions they said all sorts
[36:47] of things about him he was despised and
[36:49] rejected but he did not let himself get
[36:53] caught up in that did he feel that he
[36:56] felt that pressure it was a temptation
[36:59] to try to somehow prove who he was but
[37:02] he realized it was not within him that
[37:04] would have been pride because pride
[37:07] would have led him to try to assert
[37:09] himself but instead God had come down in
[37:12] such a measure that God was able to
[37:15] experience a battle that you and I face
[37:18] on a day-to-day basis where we have to
[37:21] submit ourselves getting away from our
[37:24] pride and in humility submitting
[37:27] ourselves to the word oh he went to
[37:31] Calvary with the helmet of salvation on
[37:35] he had a perfect faith in the perfect
[37:39] God of what the word had said about him
[37:41] he took the promises you see Jesus was
[37:45] not Jesus was not let me just put it to
[37:48] you like this Jesus just did not have
[37:50] him and I don't mean this to be a funny
[37:55] but Jesus did not have if I can bring it
[37:58] down to where we're at
[37:59] Jesus reading of the scripture was not
[38:02] just taken a slip off the table of our
[38:04] daily bread Jesus in the word was not
[38:08] just waiting on there to be a scripture
[38:10] text to him in the morning and he read
[38:12] well I did in my daily Duty that is not
[38:15] how Jesus lived his life he laid himself
[38:17] in the word and when it came time for
[38:20] the spirit to quicken the where he was
[38:23] directed to that word and that word it
[38:26] was there made manifest in his life what
[38:29] was it it was the helmet of salvation
[38:33] these promises were quickened to him
[38:36] when he would walk to Calvary think he
[38:39] would reach back look at the quickening
[38:41] power of God the quickening power of God
[38:43] it overrides the even the the the man or
[38:48] the vessel because here he goes and he
[38:52] stands and he says destroy this temple
[38:54] and I will raise it up again in three
[38:57] days Harry comes going to Calvary he
[39:00] reaches back and takes where David has
[39:03] said in Psalm 16 I have set the Lord
[39:05] always before me because he is at my
[39:08] right hand I shall not be moved
[39:10] therefore my heart is glad and my glory
[39:13] and my glory rejoices my flesh shall
[39:16] rest in hope now let me read it to you
[39:19] how Peter picked it up there and the
[39:21] inspiration that he that is that it
[39:23] would come there on the day of Pentecost
[39:25] and Peter would would would would pick
[39:28] up that scripture I just read and I
[39:29] think it's very important here he said
[39:31] for David in verse 25 of Acts - for
[39:34] David speakers concerning him I foresaw
[39:37] the Lord always before my face David
[39:43] when you were sick yeah I saw him always
[39:46] before my face David when you were in
[39:49] the midst of the trial yep always before
[39:53] I've been made no detours and try to
[39:56] find out where I left it
[39:57] he was always before me the only way
[40:01] baby can you testify well sure
[40:03] the only way that I made it for every
[40:05] test and every trial is when I kept my
[40:08] eyes on him
[40:09] I've put him before I put him over I
[40:14] foresaw the Lord David how were you able
[40:20] to walk and taste a life I foresaw the
[40:23] Lord how are you able to walk David in
[40:27] the face of lions in the face of the
[40:30] enemy how is it that you are able to
[40:33] muster strength to run from soul get out
[40:36] of this situation get out of that
[40:38] situation how is it that you are able to
[40:40] be able to prevail amongst a rebellion
[40:44] that came in your family I foresaw the
[40:48] Lord always before me you want to win
[40:54] the bike don't you if you want to win
[40:58] the bike don't take your eyes off the
[40:59] prize the enemy's objective is to get
[41:05] our eyes here and there but you remember
[41:07] you take your eyes off the destination
[41:09] you end up in detours may the Lord help
[41:13] us
[41:14] notice I've forced hauled the Lord
[41:16] always before my face for he is on my
[41:18] right hand in other words he is seated
[41:20] in power in my life that I should not be
[41:25] moved
[41:26] therefore this is why my heart did
[41:29] rejoice but David didn't you go through
[41:31] some more things yes but my heart was
[41:33] rejoicing rejoicing for the sickness
[41:36] rejoicing for the tests no how is
[41:38] rejoice see because I know this is not
[41:41] my end this is not my destiny I foresaw
[41:46] the Lord always before my face I'm
[41:50] talking about the helmet of salvation
[41:54] and my tongue was glad
[42:01] hallelujah how many say lord help me
[42:04] help me let my tongue be glad let my
[42:07] confession be positive but saying I
[42:11] don't feel no stop that it ain't about
[42:13] what you feel it's about the Word of God
[42:18] that every man's won't be aligned that
[42:21] includes my own you hear me that
[42:24] includes your thoughts and your feelings
[42:25] your word is alive but I take God's Word
[42:29] I'll take God's Word above what you want
[42:32] to suggest to me on thoughts and
[42:34] feelings I will take his word and with
[42:39] his word if there's anything that comes
[42:41] into my mind that's contrary I will cast
[42:44] out now I'm not going to ask her to
[42:47] leave we follow the scripture casting
[42:50] out Satan has me has gotten used to
[42:53] being cast out he was cast out kicked
[42:56] out of heaven he come down to earth come
[43:01] on friends we're not making deals with
[43:04] 'evil is to cast him out we're not
[43:08] trying to reform Devils were anointed by
[43:11] God to cast out Satan let me tell you
[43:15] even like the word is being preached
[43:17] right now gavels are being cast out
[43:20] devils of doubt and unbelief Devils of
[43:24] torment careful's of anxiety Devils of
[43:27] oppression Devils of sickness Devils of
[43:30] disease are being cast out by the power
[43:33] of the word of the Living God
[43:36] amen we have on us the helmet of
[43:40] salvation the doctor says you're going
[43:46] to die but the word says I cannot die
[43:49] I'm alive in him
[43:52] [Applause]
[43:59] kind of look at that helmet of salvation
[44:01] that's a good antiviral program you put
[44:05] that on brother it's got Norton beating
[44:06] everything else of course you just get
[44:09] some other brand you won't have to worry
[44:10] about that but you understand what I
[44:12] mean you put that all and it actually
[44:13] will be a protection the Word of God
[44:16] will filter and not allow anything to
[44:19] come in there moreover also my fresh my
[44:23] flesh did rest in hope because thou wilt
[44:27] not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt
[44:32] thou suffer thine Holy One to see
[44:34] corruption
[44:35] thou has made known to me the ways of
[44:38] life thou shalt make me full of joy with
[44:41] that countenance first Peter for one for
[44:45] as much then as Christ have suffered for
[44:49] us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise
[44:54] with the same mind that word arm means a
[44:58] military expedition not a parade for he
[45:03] that has suffered in the flesh hath
[45:05] ceased from sin but he should no longer
[45:09] live the rest of his time in the flesh
[45:12] to the lust of men but to the will of
[45:16] God let me just say it to you very
[45:21] clearly this morning God's salvation
[45:25] does not end with you just getting a
[45:30] cleaned up life
[45:32] it isn't just let me just back up a
[45:34] moment it isn't just for you to feel the
[45:37] load of sin lifted from your life but
[45:40] it's to get that which brought the sin
[45:43] about to get that in line with God and
[45:47] there is a not one person that can do
[45:50] that on your own but you can submit and
[45:55] that's what it has to come by a fool
[45:58] surrender God just didn't save you
[46:03] salvation is not just for you to come to
[46:05] a church
[46:08] I'm just going to be frank this morning
[46:10] you can come to this church and still be
[46:12] lost and go to hell because if you're
[46:15] trusting on just coming to a church
[46:17] you're lost but there's got to be a
[46:21] trust and an anchor in Jesus Christ and
[46:24] let me just tell you something very
[46:25] personally you might have been a pot
[46:27] addict you might have been a drunkard
[46:29] you might have been a fornicator and
[46:30] adulterer or a monger and thanks
[46:33] be to God that he's lifted you from that
[46:35] life but that still is not enough it's
[46:40] got to go deeper to where he becomes
[46:44] your life to where you arm yourself with
[46:48] this mind we're not here just to try to
[46:51] make better people this cost for is to
[46:54] change lives to where Jesus Christ
[46:57] becomes seated in power in this life and
[47:01] where that same life that lived in the
[47:03] body of flesh and said well I might be I
[47:06] may be I will know I must be about my
[47:09] father's business hey we can offer you a
[47:13] better living out here
[47:14] oh hi okay oh that's gonna take me away
[47:17] from the house of God sorry I must be
[47:19] about my father's business I must watch
[47:21] the works of him well it is day Romans
[47:30] 13:11 you see when we're looking at this
[47:33] is to realize that this helmet is made
[47:36] out of brass help me Jesus it's made out
[47:42] of brass it is notice the helmet of
[47:45] salvation the knowledge of knowing this
[47:49] my healing comes from the Lord my
[47:52] salvation comes from God my experience
[47:55] matches the word not the church's idea
[47:57] the word I'm covered over a protection
[48:01] the helmet of salvation deliverance
[48:04] brother Brent said you take that then
[48:06] you go marching forward in Romans 13:11
[48:11] and knowing the time that now it is high
[48:16] to awake out of sleep for now is our
[48:21] salvation nearer than when we believed
[48:27] verse 12 the night is far spent the day
[48:32] is at hand let us therefore cast off the
[48:37] works of darkness and let us put on the
[48:40] armor of light let us walk honestly as
[48:44] in the day not in rioting and
[48:47] drunkenness not in chambering and
[48:50] wantonness not in strife and ending but
[48:54] put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make
[48:58] not provision for the flesh to fulfill
[49:01] the lusts thereof don't give the devil
[49:06] an inch not even a millimeter 1st
[49:15] Thessalonians 5 6 therefore let us not
[49:19] sleep as others do but let us watch and
[49:23] be sober for they that sleep sleep in
[49:26] the night and they that be drunken are
[49:29] drunken in the night but let us who are
[49:33] of the day be sober putting on the
[49:37] breastplate of faith and love and for an
[49:41] helmet the hope of salvation I want you
[49:44] to catch this Paul in this writing here
[49:48] does not go to list every part of the
[49:51] armour but think how he ties it back in
[49:54] to that of Isaiah 59 where the Lord
[49:58] Jesus he took upon himself a breastplate
[50:01] as righteousness the helmet of salvation
[50:05] because remember the breastplate is not
[50:08] one piece it's two pieces it breastplate
[50:11] is having love and faith together Oh
[50:17] hallelujah so here you have love and
[50:21] faith together and when love and faith
[50:24] get together then you can have hope
[50:28] but without love and faith there ain't
[50:31] no hope I won't hope are you with me
[50:36] love and faith calling together because
[50:39] what think of where we're at we are
[50:41] children of the day the night is far
[50:43] spent just as much as he our bridegroom
[50:46] adorned these garments on Isaiah would
[50:49] be moved by the Spirit of God to pick
[50:51] this up and catch it happy the a very
[50:53] initiation of redemption and notice in
[50:56] this time of a climax or a finishing of
[51:00] redemption
[51:01] we are admonished to adorn the same
[51:04] garments that he was adorned with you
[51:06] know what it speaks of it is rapture
[51:09] time it is time where the body has
[51:12] growth from the feet through the two
[51:14] eyes it's all the way up the eyes have
[51:17] come now the intelligence has entered
[51:19] into the body like Ezekiel's dry bones
[51:22] they have been brought together by the
[51:25] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and put
[51:28] Inquisition and the adornment on our
[51:31] lives is righteousness as a breastplate
[51:34] it is the helmet which is the hope of
[51:38] salvation for God verse 9 for God hath
[51:44] not appointed us to wrath
[51:53] but saying I'm just waiting on this to
[51:55] come I went on there I'll tell you when
[51:57] I'm waiting on I'm waiting on what the
[51:58] word said for he hath not appointed us
[52:01] to wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[52:06] Lord Jesus Christ I thought we already
[52:08] had salvation but we are looking for the
[52:11] end of our salvation we have received
[52:13] the beginning of it where our souls have
[52:16] been delivered from the hold of darkness
[52:19] upon our life and the date start has
[52:21] arisen in our heart the day has already
[52:23] moved in our life we're only waiting for
[52:26] the ending of our salvation or the
[52:29] redemption of the body that which will
[52:32] match what God has done in our soul
[52:37] hallelujah he's not appointed us to
[52:39] wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[52:42] Lord Jesus Christ you know what I would
[52:45] do I would say I know where I'm going I
[52:48] am redeemed let the redeemed of the Lord
[52:51] think so no say so I am redeemed you
[53:01] wake up in the morning is this the day
[53:07] listen what do you mean is this the day
[53:09] I don't want to get fired I don't want
[53:11] to lose my pension I don't you're
[53:13] looking at the wrong you're looking at
[53:14] the wrong thing your hope is in the
[53:16] wrong thing your hope is in the things
[53:18] of carnality and if your hope is there
[53:21] you'll find yourself dreading you'll
[53:23] find yourself just barely moving along
[53:25] that's why you've got always foresee the
[53:28] Lord before you and we need help
[53:31] sometimes because we walk in this
[53:34] humanity but arm yourselves with that
[53:38] same mind that you will not live you are
[53:41] live your life according to the lust of
[53:42] the flesh you know in that scripture
[53:44] right there many people say well I don't
[53:45] smoke I don't drink I don't do none of
[53:47] those other things anymore praise be to
[53:48] god i've been delivered but yet they
[53:50] talk negative they gave up the dead as
[53:52] far as swearing what would be set out
[53:54] there but they still swear they talk the
[53:56] devil's language I'm no good I'm
[53:58] weakened faith and that's exactly what
[54:00] the Prophet said he said
[54:01] when you gonna talk and negative and
[54:03] saying my faith is really weak he said
[54:05] you're talking the devil's language how
[54:10] about speaking of pure language we've
[54:13] been given a pure language now come on
[54:17] friends don't freeze up on me now
[54:18] Oh blue semi you just don't know what
[54:20] I'm going through you just don't know no
[54:21] but what the Spirit of God is trying to
[54:23] do is help you not remove you from your
[54:25] trial not remove you from you know what
[54:28] you're going through but it's trying to
[54:30] give you an expectation to get your eyes
[54:32] off of the circumstance and get your
[54:35] eyes back on the deliverer he who will
[54:38] save you oh this is what he did he died
[54:44] for us that whether we wake or sleep we
[54:48] should live together with him either way
[54:52] I'm a winner I said either way we're a
[54:58] winner God has answered and will answer
[55:01] and does answer and continues to answer
[55:04] every prayer Maude let me just say how
[55:10] could get going on that prayer here if
[55:12] it is just a wherefore here's verse 11
[55:16] where for because of this comfort
[55:20] yourselves together I'm gonna send you
[55:24] you know yeah that's what I need I need
[55:25] the comfort of the Lord that's not what
[55:27] he's talking about he said you have
[55:29] access to the comforter these are words
[55:32] that are ministered for your comfort
[55:35] comfort see comfort she owes I am this
[55:39] is a word for you to take and say this
[55:42] is my consolation come on now the Bible
[55:46] speaks the breast of her consolation
[55:48] what does that do a baby does not stop
[55:51] crying because it's nursing it stops
[55:53] crying because it's next to the
[55:54] heartbeat of the mother
[55:59] Oh hallelujah wherefore comfort yourself
[56:07] together and edify one another even as
[56:12] you also do this is what that word hope
[56:19] put on notice how Paul would write here
[56:21] by inspiration put on the helmet which
[56:24] is the hope of salvation
[56:27] this word hope here it is to anticipate
[56:32] usually with pleasure I think it's safe
[56:37] to say you have a contrast to that
[56:39] nobody is anticipating tomorrow morning
[56:44] in the job with pleasure no doubt we're
[56:48] thankful we got jobs right thankful
[56:51] thankful we had jobs but I would say
[56:53] nobody well maybe not I don't know some
[56:54] people might have because you know how
[56:57] it is sometimes it's up and down there's
[56:58] certain times you're like wow and then
[56:59] there's other times and God just happens
[57:01] to go through that law of pro and Collin
[57:03] but this is one thing that we can
[57:06] anticipate with pleasure it is an
[57:09] expectation of good hope and in the
[57:12] Christian sense joyful and confident
[57:16] expectation of eternal salvation if in
[57:21] this life we only have hope we are among
[57:25] most men miserable now notice this hope
[57:30] itself hope is something that was not
[57:33] meant just to be out here loosely hope
[57:36] is something that perhaps we'll look at
[57:38] it here and another time hope is
[57:40] governed as we would see within that
[57:42] verse of scripture we were reading with
[57:44] the breastplate of love and faith Paul
[57:46] would pick it up and write and say that
[57:49] with these right here
[57:50] we have faith hope and charity Paul
[57:52] would write by inspiration and he would
[57:54] not put hope before faith but he would
[57:57] put faith and then right after faith he
[57:59] would write Hulk and with love because
[58:01] love is the predominating force that
[58:03] produces faith and remember blue Graham
[58:05] said faith is burly faith just as
[58:08] brother Brent would say like this I
[58:09] think it's fitting he said it's like
[58:11] that of where he said it's God it's a
[58:13] chest that's
[58:13] hair on it he said but hope all he said
[58:16] hope is a beautiful timid little thing
[58:21] it's got its place
[58:23] he said because if you take a man that's
[58:26] got such Ralph faith man he said like
[58:28] you'll hear some of them that said they
[58:30] got bored old faith he said what happens
[58:31] they ruined their influence among the
[58:33] people because it's not tempered with
[58:36] hope well we'll say that we'll save that
[58:40] you see this is part of our adornment
[58:42] this is part of our garment so to have
[58:45] hope hope itself is not something of
[58:47] just you know like if I come to you or
[58:49] you come to me and say well you know I'm
[58:50] here
[58:51] I'm hoping man I'm hopefully gonna get
[58:53] my dinner right today I'm hoping this is
[58:55] not what hope is hope is not something
[58:57] or you just turn up say well you know I
[58:59] don't know that's not what hope is hope
[59:01] remember faith is the substance of
[59:04] things hoped for
[59:07] I probably gonna need this now notice
[59:13] this in the scripture there must be the
[59:16] armor of the light divine revelation
[59:20] hallelujah now what's report Paul is
[59:22] writing about this here in the book of
[59:24] Acts but it's where Paul remembers being
[59:27] brought before the the the the Pharisees
[59:30] and the Sadducees the governors and his
[59:33] ten before Felix stands before Agrippa
[59:35] and Paul begins to express in these
[59:38] things you know where he would speak and
[59:41] looking at the congregation of the
[59:42] Sadducees and Pharisees Paul just
[59:45] looking at that and he thought man there
[59:46] is a lot of these guys here let me just
[59:48] split them wide open Paul said I'm a
[59:50] Pharisee I believe in the resurrection
[59:52] of the Dead immediately he had some
[59:54] Pharisees that rose up and said man you
[59:57] Sadducees you guys don't believe she's
[1:00:00] already where the word is working to
[1:00:02] divide and conquer come on it's just
[1:00:05] like you can be gathered together with
[1:00:07] Baptist Pentecostal Methodists and
[1:00:08] whatever more and you can say I believe
[1:00:10] the moment I believe that was saved and
[1:00:13] me do you have some rise up and say oh
[1:00:15] no not that at all you've already
[1:00:16] started dividing a conquer and then you
[1:00:18] go on and say and I also believe there
[1:00:21] is sanctifying power in the blood of
[1:00:23] Jesus Christ dividing and conquer
[1:00:25] you go on to say I believe in a genuine
[1:00:28] that ISM of the Holy Ghost dividing and
[1:00:30] conquering and you go on to bring it
[1:00:32] down to the place that I believe the
[1:00:34] same Holy Spirit in that is living now
[1:00:38] inside of my life inside of his body in
[1:00:41] the fulfillment of the last day promised
[1:00:43] it's dividing and conquering no repeater
[1:00:48] God now notice in I in acts 24 24 here
[1:00:52] is Paul standing before Felix he said I
[1:00:54] confess unto thee that after the way
[1:00:56] which they call heresy so worship I the
[1:01:02] God of my father's believing all things
[1:01:08] believing all things which are written
[1:01:12] in the law and in the prophets it wasn't
[1:01:16] that those guys didn't believe the
[1:01:19] writing they just didn't believe the
[1:01:21] writing because when it was fulfilled
[1:01:25] and came off the page they didn't
[1:01:28] believe it they rejected it and notice
[1:01:33] Paul says and have hope toward God which
[1:01:38] they themselves also allowed that there
[1:01:39] shall be a resurrection of the dead
[1:01:41] boast of both of the just and unjust he
[1:01:43] goes on to say here in acts 29 5 which
[1:01:46] knew me from the beginning if they would
[1:01:48] testify that after the most straightest
[1:01:51] sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee
[1:01:53] and now I stand and am judged for the
[1:01:57] hope of the promise made of God unto our
[1:02:01] fathers unto which promise our twelve
[1:02:04] tribes instantly serving God day and
[1:02:08] night you see what polls identify the
[1:02:10] real true message of God when the
[1:02:13] revelation stretched the heart of the
[1:02:14] believer it doesn't take you out of the
[1:02:17] Bible it puts you right in the
[1:02:19] scriptures that's the real true
[1:02:21] revelation of the message in every age
[1:02:24] it puts us in the scriptures so if
[1:02:28] there's something that needs to be an
[1:02:30] addendum you better get rid of that
[1:02:32] addendum
[1:02:35] Hunter which promised our 12 tribes
[1:02:38] instantly serving God day and night hope
[1:02:42] to come for which hopes sake King
[1:02:44] Agrippa I'm accused of the Jews see
[1:02:47] remember the Jews they sought not the
[1:02:50] righteousness of God by faith they
[1:02:53] sought it by works is that right you see
[1:02:57] that shows there was an absence of the
[1:03:00] light of divine revelation and with that
[1:03:03] right there it hindered their hope they
[1:03:06] were blinded for the very thing that
[1:03:08] they were hoping for you see this show
[1:03:12] their hope their hope was putting it way
[1:03:15] out there it's going to come this way
[1:03:17] it's going to come that way our
[1:03:19] expectation is of the Lord but it's I
[1:03:24] mean how you gonna know when it's
[1:03:26] fulfilled just as I know that when it's
[1:03:28] been fulfilled that he put the seal on
[1:03:29] my soul he will declare himself so I
[1:03:38] would just say like this an
[1:03:39] encouragement
[1:03:39] don't miss your answer I said don't miss
[1:03:42] your answer we are yoked to the word
[1:03:46] think of how Paul would write this in
[1:03:48] acts 28 24 this calls therefore I have
[1:03:52] called for you to see you and to speak
[1:03:55] with you because that for the hope of
[1:03:58] Israel I am bound with this chain but
[1:04:04] you and I are not bound with a man may
[1:04:08] chain
[1:04:09] Paul though his hands were bound but
[1:04:12] Paul was speaking of a greater hold in
[1:04:14] his life I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:04:20] hallelujah as they would write in the
[1:04:22] Old Testament prisoners of the hope of
[1:04:25] Israel gonna be the job we are not yet -
[1:04:29] the word under man-made bondage of fear
[1:04:32] you can do this if you do this if you
[1:04:34] don't do that I tell you let's go no
[1:04:36] we're not bound in that way that's not
[1:04:38] what the word is let me just tell you
[1:04:39] something this morning right here
[1:04:41] there's nothing's I don't want you to do
[1:04:43] something because of what I preach I
[1:04:45] preach God's Word what
[1:04:47] need to do is say lord help me to die to
[1:04:49] the world take the world out of my life
[1:04:52] not all my I can't have this one if I go
[1:04:55] there like this brother sand is gonna
[1:04:57] preach on me brother sender is gonna do
[1:04:59] this but this ham is gonna do this no
[1:05:01] ask God for something much greater say
[1:05:03] Lord take the shame from my soul take
[1:05:09] the world out of my life lord I need
[1:05:12] deliverance some 130 verse 5 i wait for
[1:05:22] the lord my soul of wait and in his word
[1:05:27] do i hope my soul waited for the Lord
[1:05:30] more than they that watch for the
[1:05:32] morning I say more than they that watch
[1:05:36] for the morning Oh David's making an
[1:05:37] emphasis here I'm telling you I'm
[1:05:39] watching more for him and I'm watching
[1:05:41] more for the morning are you are you
[1:05:48] watching more for him than the growth of
[1:05:50] your 401k preach brother Sam are you
[1:05:54] watching more for him than your next job
[1:05:56] promotion come on now are you watching
[1:06:00] more for him than being occupied with
[1:06:02] things that are you looking for him
[1:06:06] above everything else then I'll say
[1:06:12] he'll guide you through everything that
[1:06:14] is before you let Israel hope in the
[1:06:19] Lord for with the Lord there is mercy
[1:06:22] and with him is plenteous Redemption and
[1:06:26] he shall redeem Israel from all his
[1:06:30] iniquities notice how even wrote the
[1:06:33] Spirit of God breaking over and Isaiah
[1:06:35] it would write and seem as though that
[1:06:37] it would be speaking to Isaiah as his
[1:06:40] servant but yet to recognize it speaking
[1:06:42] to the Spirit of Christ that is veiled
[1:06:44] within Isaiah and he would write under
[1:06:47] the prophecy of the Spirit and he said
[1:06:49] it is a light thing that thou should us
[1:06:50] be my servant to raise up the tribes of
[1:06:53] Jacob and to restore the preserved of
[1:06:56] Israel I will also give thee for Allah
[1:06:59] to the Gentiles that pound may us be my
[1:07:02] salvation unto the earth Paul would
[1:07:07] write in this in Ephesians 1 verse 17
[1:07:10] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:07:12] father of glory who may give unto you
[1:07:15] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:07:18] the knowledge of him that the eyes of
[1:07:20] your understanding being enlightened
[1:07:22] that you may know what is the hope of
[1:07:26] his calling and what is the riches of
[1:07:28] the glory of his inheritance in the
[1:07:30] Saints what is the exceeding greatness
[1:07:33] of his power to us were who believe
[1:07:35] according to the working of his mighty
[1:07:38] power he would go on to say in Ephesians
[1:07:40] 4:4 there is one body and one spirit
[1:07:43] even as ye are called in one hope of
[1:07:47] your calling remember we were without
[1:07:51] hope he came to redeem Israel but the
[1:07:58] mystery that was hidden in there the
[1:08:00] mystery in the seventy weeks of Daniel
[1:08:02] the mystery that was there would be a
[1:08:05] calling out of a Gentile bride as Joseph
[1:08:08] was rejected of his brother and Joseph
[1:08:10] was there in Egypt he was given given
[1:08:13] given a Gentile bride a man and it was
[1:08:17] there all glory it was there within that
[1:08:19] Gentile bride there were children that
[1:08:22] came forth by the name of the NASA and
[1:08:24] Ephraim the think of it if you can have
[1:08:26] things in your life Manasseh means for
[1:08:29] God the one who has caused me to forget
[1:08:32] I tell you a real birth can cause you to
[1:08:35] forget your past a real birth can bring
[1:08:38] healing in your life if you've got hurt
[1:08:40] in your life
[1:08:41] say Lord give me a man ask the Lord give
[1:08:44] me a Manasseh one that has caused me to
[1:08:47] forget the hurt the rejection the
[1:08:50] displacement give me healing Lord give
[1:08:54] me my Manasseh Lord we didn't have no
[1:08:59] hope but the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:09:04] made us nigh
[1:09:06] Rahab didn't have a hope but Simone
[1:09:10] brought or not Ruth didn't have a hope
[1:09:13] but beau has brought her nah this is why
[1:09:21] Paul could ride in first Timothy 1:1
[1:09:23] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:09:26] commandment of God our Savior and Lord
[1:09:28] Jesus Christ which is our hope
[1:09:31] Titus 1:1 Paul a servant of God and an
[1:09:35] apostle of Jesus Christ according to the
[1:09:37] faith of God's elect and the
[1:09:39] acknowledging of the truth which is
[1:09:40] after godliness in hope of eternal life
[1:09:44] which God that cannot lie promised
[1:09:50] before the world began listen while you
[1:09:59] reading the scriptures because this is
[1:10:01] what he had me to do because if you can
[1:10:06] recognize and see that your life down
[1:10:09] here is not just something that began
[1:10:12] down here but it was there in the mind
[1:10:14] of God before the foundation of the
[1:10:17] world your life and my life Psalms 139
[1:10:20] oh how wonderful and marvelous are thy
[1:10:23] thoughts concerning me O Lord I am
[1:10:25] fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:10:28] that means marked out with a distinction
[1:10:31] there are predestinated boundaries that
[1:10:34] my name is set in not one of the tribes
[1:10:37] of Israel I was ordained in Christ
[1:10:39] before the foundation of the world and
[1:10:42] God sent aware to call me out of Egypt
[1:10:45] and bring me into the promised land of
[1:10:48] his word in hope mbuto expectation of
[1:10:58] eternal life which God that cannot lie
[1:11:01] promised before the world begin you know
[1:11:05] if that does it causes you to rise up
[1:11:07] and say hey the trouble that's before me
[1:11:10] God already knew about you
[1:11:15] the devil can say yeah but do you know
[1:11:17] this is your own choices truth but he's
[1:11:20] plenteous in Redemption what are you
[1:11:25] doing I'm talking about the helmet of
[1:11:27] salvation Oh
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:33] Jesus hallelujah verse three but hath
[1:11:37] ndu times look at this but hath in due
[1:11:40] times manifested his word through
[1:11:43] preaching which is committed unto me
[1:11:47] according to the commandment of God our
[1:11:48] Savior Paul would write in second
[1:11:51] Corinthians 3:12 regarding the
[1:11:53] revelation in his heart the ministration
[1:11:55] of the spirit of how that his heart the
[1:11:57] veil had been removed from his heart he
[1:12:00] would say seeing them that we have such
[1:12:02] hope we use great plainness of speech
[1:12:08] that means boldness confidence
[1:12:12] confidence yes because you can see
[1:12:16] everything and all that you have need of
[1:12:19] is in him and he is in you Galatians 5 5
[1:12:28] for we through the spirit wait for the
[1:12:34] hope of righteousness by faith Paul
[1:12:41] Peter would write 1st Peter 1 verse 3
[1:12:43] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:12:46] Lord Jesus Christ which according to his
[1:12:48] abundant mercy has begotten us again the
[1:12:51] word begotten again means born again
[1:12:53] unto a lively hope by the resurrection
[1:12:56] of Jesus Christ from the dead to an
[1:12:59] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[1:13:03] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[1:13:06] for you who are kept by the power of God
[1:13:09] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:13:13] revealed in the last time I've got an
[1:13:17] invitation to a wedding but not as a

[1:13:46] the highest hey man he has he has
[1:13:48] birthed us into a lively hope Paula
[1:13:53] Peter would write on who barely was for

[1:14:06] concerning you aren't you glad he
[1:14:08] manifests his thoughts aren't you glad
[1:14:11] he declares his thoughts aren't you glad
[1:14:14] that he makes love to you aren't you
[1:14:16] glad that he sweeps around with his
[1:14:18] presence and lets you know I love you
[1:14:21] I've never lost sight of you those
[1:14:23] things would want to come between us
[1:14:25] I've always loved you I sought you out
[1:14:29] you always were mine he manifests in a
[1:14:35] service like this for when we're going
[1:14:38] through things what he's already for
[1:14:41] ordained that we would stand victorious
[1:14:43] but he would come down brother Carlos
[1:14:46] and manifest himself and say keep your
[1:14:51] head up son greater is He that's in you
[1:14:57] you're more than a conqueror they they

[1:15:18] God hallelujah
[1:15:21] glory be to God in the highest Paul
[1:15:24] would go on to write about this let me
[1:15:25] just kind of move here Paul would write
[1:15:27] about this the hope that's reserved he
[1:15:29] would Paul would write of it in the
[1:15:30] first part of Colossians Paul would
[1:15:32] bring it down into the place through
[1:15:34] Colossians
[1:15:36] that place of how that God in verse 27
[1:15:38] of Colossians one to whom god would make
[1:15:40] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:15:43] this mystery among the gentiles which is

[1:16:23] didn't come to pass God always answers
[1:16:26] his prayer brother madam said if I
[1:16:31] prayed for ten thousand tonight and
[1:16:34] every one of them died I'd be standing
[1:16:36] on the platform tomorrow night ready to
[1:16:39] pray for the sick why God word can't

[1:19:56] God
[1:19:56] your sisters knowing your election
[1:19:59] noticed this knowing of our election
[1:20:01] notice for our gospel came not unto you
[1:20:06] in word only but was also in power and
[1:20:11] in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance
[1:20:16] this gospel didn't come to just run
[1:20:21] Goliath back out of your life it came to
[1:20:23] take the last head off it came to bring
[1:20:27] deliverance to Israel it came to bring

[1:20:38] as you know what men are a man we were
[1:20:41] among you for your sake no in your
[1:20:43] election it was not you it was God who
[1:20:46] got a hold of you it was God who drew
[1:20:48] you you didn't read yourself into this
[1:20:51] message it was God by His grace that has
[1:20:54] revealed himself to you it is God by His
[1:20:56] grace that has brought to you life and
[1:21:02] you realize this message did not come
[1:21:05] across your path way back Oh incidence
[1:21:09] it was not accidental when Jesus
[1:21:14] delivers a package he knows exactly
[1:21:16] where it's supposed to go you were
[1:21:23] living in one address but it was that
[1:21:25] package that would put you in your
[1:21:27] rightful position at the right address
[1:21:30] so that every other thing it is founded
[1:21:34] in Christ Jesus that is your position
[1:21:38] and as the son of God and a daughter of
[1:21:43] God we have access to the throne knowing
[1:21:48] your election brethren as brother
[1:21:50] William pray here this morning we're not
[1:21:51] coming Lord to beg that would that would
[1:21:53] be dis complimentary to him but we come
[1:21:56] and say my father our Heavenly Father
[1:22:00] what a privilege it is to know that by
[1:22:03] divine revelation give me just a little
[1:22:07] bit more time okay it's just just a
[1:22:10] little bit more and you became followers
[1:22:12] of us and of the Lord having received a
[1:22:14] word in much affliction with joy of the
[1:22:16] Holy Ghost so that you were in samples
[1:22:20] or examples to all that believe in
[1:22:21] Macedonian and Acacia for from you sound
[1:22:24] that out the word of the Lord not only a
[1:22:27] Macedonian acacia but also in every
[1:22:29] place your faith to God word is spread
[1:22:31] of it spread abroad so that we need not
[1:22:33] to speak anything for they themselves
[1:22:34] show us what manner of entering in we
[1:22:37] had unto you and how you turn to God
[1:22:39] from idols to serve the living and true
[1:22:41] God let me just say this this testimony
[1:22:45] they had in their life what
[1:22:46] somebody seen a picture in their wallet
[1:22:50] he wasn't because somebody come on now
[1:22:53] preach with me they wanted to call
[1:22:54] somebody seen a picture on their wall
[1:22:56] it's because the same God who came down
[1:23:00] and had his picture taken with us is now
[1:23:03] living in our fish they were testifying
[1:23:09] of this it wasn't so well let me bring
[1:23:11] it to my pastor you know he's a real man
[1:23:13] of God nothing wrong with that thank you
[1:23:15] for the compliment I trust that's well
[1:23:16] how you feel I trust that that's the
[1:23:18] reality not about feeling but that you
[1:23:20] realize that it's called he's the one
[1:23:22] that's feeding you but let me just tell
[1:23:23] you and drop it down real clear you need
[1:23:26] to have a testimony not a testimony
[1:23:31] that's important people to brother
[1:23:32] Samuel not a testimony that just stops
[1:23:38] and points people said well you know we
[1:23:40] just believe this and we believe God
[1:23:41] sent a prophet the testimony in your
[1:23:43] life he it ought to be a testimony that
[1:23:46] says the promise that God has made in
[1:23:49] his word he has come back and he has
[1:23:52] fulfilled that promise and that same God
[1:23:55] is living through my life without us
[1:23:58] even speaking that ought to be the
[1:24:01] testimony for from you sounded out so if
[1:24:12] the life expression in your home or
[1:24:14] anywhere else has left anybody's mind
[1:24:16] where you would think man it's kind of
[1:24:17] foggy man I don't know maybe maybe
[1:24:19] people looking at my life they wouldn't
[1:24:20] know where I stand well you know I go to
[1:24:21] brother Sanders Church that don't mean
[1:24:23] nothing where do you stand in Christ if
[1:24:27] your identity is only here in this
[1:24:29] church you got problems you need to have
[1:24:31] your identity the whole preaching of the
[1:24:33] gospel is that you would be identified
[1:24:36] in Christ Jesus there's some friends I'm
[1:24:44] not against you I'm here to minister to
[1:24:46] help you that you would have the real
[1:24:48] hope in your life where a faith loud
[1:24:52] that would got it notice verse 12 and to
[1:24:55] wait for his son from heaven whom he
[1:24:59] raised from the
[1:25:00] even Jesus which delivered us from the
[1:25:03] wrath to come 1st Thessalonians 4 I
[1:25:07] would not have you ignorant brethren
[1:25:11] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:25:15] you sorrow not even as others which have
[1:25:19] no hope for if we believe that Jesus
[1:25:23] died and rose again even so them also
[1:25:26] which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[1:25:29] him for this we say unto you by the word
[1:25:31] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:25:34] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:25:37] not prevent them which are asleep for
[1:25:39] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:25:41] heaven with a shout that's the message
[1:25:45] that's the Living bread of life that is
[1:25:47] his own life with the voice of the
[1:25:52] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[1:25:55] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[1:25:59] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:26:03] caught up together with them in the
[1:26:07] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:26:09] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:26:11] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:26:16] words
[1:26:27] Tidus would write under inspiration see
[1:26:30] ya this same what we're seeing is the
[1:26:32] same inspiration these are not new
[1:26:34] scriptures to us as Bible readers but
[1:26:37] there's a there there is that which God
[1:26:39] is making very clear to us when the Lord
[1:26:41] Jesus came he had righteousness as a
[1:26:45] breastplate he had on the helmet of
[1:26:47] salvation what when that word and the
[1:26:50] promises they were quickened to him he
[1:26:53] went about the father's business it was
[1:26:56] a life that was occupied with a
[1:26:59] fulfillment of the word not that he
[1:27:01] could bring it to pass but he said it's
[1:27:04] not me that doeth the works but the
[1:27:06] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:27:08] works and so that same life moving
[1:27:11] within you and I it has moved every age
[1:27:14] what we just read here Paul did not say
[1:27:16] of those that are lay down there in that
[1:27:18] lay do see an age those that are down
[1:27:21] there that are alive and remain Paul
[1:27:22] didn't write it that way he said though
[1:27:24] we are alive and remain we shall not
[1:27:32] hinder Paul preached it as every
[1:27:36] believer they preached it that the
[1:27:39] coming of the Lord was in their day and
[1:27:43] it could happen at any time and the
[1:27:47] faint the Spirit of God would give them
[1:27:50] that urgency but you and I we're not
[1:27:53] preaching of something looking ahead as
[1:27:56] far as out there to a promise there is a
[1:27:59] declaration by the fulfillment of the
[1:28:02] word that gives us a real hope by real
[1:28:06] faith that the rapture is not something
[1:28:09] out there but the rapture is in us now
[1:28:14] we have been brought into the rapture
[1:28:17] cycle this is the call we of her behold
[1:28:21] the bridegroom cometh
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:26] this is the call knowing the time
[1:28:29] brethren our salvation is nearer than
[1:28:33] when we first believed and all of these
[1:28:41] here they were right I want to read
[1:28:43] these okay I just have to read this in
[1:28:48] Titus what's this
[1:28:49] because in the Word of God we find
[1:28:52] strength for the grace of God Titus 2:11
[1:28:55] that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
[1:28:58] all men teaching us that denying
[1:29:01] ungodliness and worldly lusts we should
[1:29:04] live soberly righteously and godly in
[1:29:07] this present world looking for the
[1:29:09] Blessed hope and the glorious appearing
[1:29:12] of the Great God and our Savior Jesus
[1:29:14] Christ who gave himself for us that he
[1:29:17] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[1:29:20] purify unto himself a peculiar people
[1:29:23] zealous of good works Timothy Titus 3:3
[1:29:28] for we ourselves also were sometimes
[1:29:29] foolish disobedient deceived serving
[1:29:33] divers lusts and pleasures living in
[1:29:37] malice and envy and hateful and hating
[1:29:39] one another but after the kindness and
[1:29:42] love of God our Savior toward man
[1:29:44] appeared not by works of righteousness
[1:29:46] which we have done but according to His
[1:29:49] mercy he saved us by the washing of
[1:29:52] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[1:29:54] Ghost which He shed on us abundantly
[1:29:56] through Jesus Christ our Savior that
[1:29:59] being justified by His grace we should
[1:30:02] be made heirs according to the hope of
[1:30:05] eternal life when you have received the
[1:30:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost you have
[1:30:13] received the earnest the earnest of your
[1:30:21] salvation receive the earnest the
[1:30:25] downpayment that says Healing has come
[1:30:30] to my soul

[1:30:36] about this virus no I got a good
[1:30:37] anti-virus I got inoculated aren't you
[1:30:42] worried about germ warfare no I already
[1:30:44] received the antidote
[1:30:46] I've already been inoculated by the
[1:30:48] baptism of the holy ghost it's not a
[1:30:51] life of up and down in in and out it's a
[1:30:54] life where we have been inoculated by
[1:30:56] the power of Almighty God it is not me
[1:30:59] that's overcoming it is Christ in me
[1:31:01] that's already overcome and manifesting
[1:31:04] his overcoming power through my life as
[1:31:07] I surrender to him he manifests his
[1:31:10] overcoming power in my life so the test
[1:31:17] the trial whatever it is that you'll be
[1:31:21] facing

[1:31:25] to look way out there for the answer

[1:31:32] can't get to that this morning he's
[1:31:34] already put the answer in ya when he

[1:33:35] going on and around him the inspiration
[1:33:38] would strike job and job would would
[1:33:40] stand up at that time and say though the
[1:33:43] skin worms would destroy this body yet

[1:34:32] the shadow that diamon a those ain't
[1:34:34] funeral-home scriptures those are
[1:34:37] scriptures from my life
[1:34:39] they ain't scriptures I need for
[1:34:41] somebody to read over me if I told by
[1:34:43] the way of the grave that's a testimony
[1:34:45] to me right now
[1:34:47] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:34:51] I shall not want
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:34:57] hallelujah he maketh me to lie down in
[1:35:01] green pastures he leadeth me beside the
[1:35:03] still waters
[1:35:04] sometimes the troubled waters it's hard
[1:35:07] to see herself but then every once while
[1:35:08] he brings us by still waters and we can
[1:35:11] look and say yep that's me son of God
[1:35:15] who does that the Lord is my shepherd
[1:35:21] right in the presence of mine enemies he
[1:35:24] prepares the table here known as my head
[1:35:28] with oil my cup runneth over
[1:35:30] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:35:33] me chase after me
[1:35:36] all the days of my life the prodigal son
[1:35:58] couldn't outrun him you see we're
[1:36:00] talking about the helmet of salvation is
[1:36:03] to see when God in His salvation there
[1:36:07] is no weakness there's no cracks in this
[1:36:12] armor this armor is sure it's been
[1:36:18] tested so what are you saying
[1:36:23] I'm saying this right here let me back
[1:36:26] up and get it
[1:36:26] what brother David said in Psalms 138 6
[1:36:30] though the Lord be high yet he hath
[1:36:33] respect unto the lowly but the proud he
[1:36:35] knoweth afar off though I walk in the
[1:36:38] midst of trouble
[1:36:40] thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch
[1:36:43] forth thine hand against the wrath of
[1:36:46] vanya of mine enemies and thy right hand
[1:36:48] shall save me horror lament David he is
[1:36:51] testifying
[1:36:53] before the hand has ever picked him up
[1:37:03] open Sena you know I wouldn't want to
[1:37:05] bring reproach on the Lord I would want
[1:37:07] your testifying of a finished work he
[1:37:11] comes to finish what he's already
[1:37:13] finished come on somebody already in
[1:37:20] Romans 8 already in the presence of God
[1:37:22] he sees you as a finished product come
[1:37:26] on man we have predestinated them a also
[1:37:29] called then they are called he also
[1:37:31] justified those who justify he's already
[1:37:33] glorified brother Brenner picks it up in
[1:37:35] Jehovah Jireh he said see God already
[1:37:37] sees you as a finished product that's
[1:37:40] why the Spirit of God moves in your
[1:37:42] heart and in my heart that it will not
[1:37:45] allow us to be complacent if you find
[1:37:49] your life where you're complacent this

[1:38:00] member you're not keeping me from my
[1:38:02] rights as a believer there is a longing

[1:38:08] I want to have that deliverance in my
[1:38:11] heart personally no sir there's a
[1:38:13] yearning there's a deep that's calling

[1:38:19] longing you're not keeping me from my
[1:38:21] redemptive rights I am claiming my
[1:38:24] redemptive rights the Lord verse 8 will

[1:39:08] money no no it's without money or price

[1:39:13] gold that there is even in the earth
