[31:27] the one that that's brought us to
[31:29] himself amen he's the one working in our
[31:31] lives amen all that God asked of us to
[31:35] do the greatest thing is just to believe
[31:38] just like we were looking at a little
[31:40] bit this morning on that of the
[31:41] scripture where the Philippian Jailer
[31:44] was told believe on the Lord and thy and
[31:48] thy house shall be saved and the prophet
[31:51] tells us he says what it is as soon as
[31:53] you
[31:54] believe there is a faith that is
[31:56] released to you that will lift you above
[31:59] the things of the world it's a faith
[32:02] that comes from God it lifts us so it's
[32:05] not us it's not me quitting this
[32:07] quitting that no it's God's faith moves
[32:09] in and it lifts us above that and it's
[32:13] where our whole the whole point is God
[32:16] working to bring our will in line with
[32:18] his will and that's all we want to do
[32:21] tonight we just want to yield to the
[32:23] Lord and just let God have his way I
[32:25] want to say it's it's so good to see the
[32:27] young people that are here I know

[32:30] places and we've had dealt with some
[32:32] even in the assembly but it's good to be

[45:06] one and God bless you all thanks for
[45:07] inviting me you know uh there's so many
[45:10] good great young ministers now I I
[45:13] rarely get invited to youth things
[45:15] anymore and if I do I defer it to
[45:17] somebody else like brother Nathaniel
[45:19] I've heard some good things about his
[45:21] courtship teaching we want to hap him
[45:22] over brother Samuel's done youth things
[45:24] for us I'm getting too old for this
[45:27] but I like to hang around the young
[45:29] people because I can stay young I love
[45:32] young people so thanks for inviting me
[45:34] tonight the pastor in the church I
[45:35] appreciate it so much but yeah I'm I'm
[45:37] deferring to some of this you know
[45:38] brother Alex is here and these guys
[45:40] young blood coming up boy they just have
[45:42] a lot more energy and I'm just excited
[45:45] about the army that God's raising up you
[45:48] know somebody said the other day said I
[45:49] don't know what we're going to do if
[45:50] that one brother if he if he goes off
[45:52] the scene I don't know what the bride's
[45:53] going to do I say what I said the
[45:55] bride's going to be just fine that's it
[45:58] the bride will be just fine he always
[46:01] has the fful ministry to take his people
[46:04] and you know brother vman says he said
[46:06] Luther had one light and then they come
[46:08] further and advance in the word Wesley
[46:09] had one Pentecost and he said now the
[46:11] message has advanced beyond that and
[46:14] then he said if there is another
[46:15] generation they will go beyond
[46:18] us can you say praise the Lord so God's
[46:22] in charge of the Holy Ghost is in charge
[46:23] of all this and so but we do appreciate
[46:26] you so I hope I hope I can share
[46:27] something tonight out of the word of God
[46:29] would be a blessing to you an
[46:30] encouragement to you in your journey and
[46:33] uh it's a challenge these These Times is
[46:35] a challenge for young people there's
[46:37] many challenges there's many things that
[46:39] we can talk about but we love you the
[46:41] lord loves you and he knew that you
[46:43] would be here in this time in these
[46:45] challenging situations and so he he
[46:48] knows all things and he knows how to
[46:51] take care of you during these times and
[46:53] lead you to the right things just one
[46:55] verse here Isaiah and verse one in the
[46:58] year that King Uzziah died I saw also
[47:03] the Lord sitting upon a throne high and
[47:08] lifted up and his train filled the
[47:11] temple father may you bless your word
[47:14] tonight may you just be with us Lord and
[47:16] come near us and Lord through your word
[47:19] when it's lifted before the people then
[47:21] Lord the the P your the person steps in
[47:24] and you're able to give Revelation
[47:26] you're able people to come near the
[47:28] youth Lord and Lord when they meet you
[47:31] as a person something just becomes real
[47:33] in their heart and there's a foundation
[47:35] LED in laid in their life and Lord we
[47:37] just pray that you help us and you
[47:39] strengthen us Lord and give us Grace
[47:41] tonight for this service in Jesus name
[47:44] amen God bless you ask you to pray for
[47:46] our wife my wife I just dropped here at
[47:48] the motel she's having some sickness
[47:50] there and so just remember her in prayer
[47:52] she wanted to be here tonight and she's
[47:54] listening so remember her in prayer if
[47:56] you would I want to speak about Isaiah a
[47:58] little bit tonight but not just Isaiah
[48:01] and what he went through here but I
[48:03] think it would be a good uh text Brother
[48:05] Bram took this text and talked about
[48:07] young people a little bit under the
[48:09] message influence and he read this
[48:10] scripture there's much that we can learn
[48:12] out of the life here of these two young
[48:14] men and so I I want to look at this just
[48:17] a little bit tonight I trust it'll be a
[48:19] blessing to you in the year King Uzziah
[48:22] died I saw also the Lord so that
[48:25] particular year in
[48:27] uh in Isaiah's life was a a a special
[48:30] year it was uh you know I'm sure he had
[48:32] his whole life but this particular Year
[48:35] God had some changes for Isaiah and he
[48:38] came to a turning point in his life
[48:41] Isaiah came to a turning point in his
[48:43] life and God ordered certain things to
[48:46] happen that he didn't expect with his
[48:49] buddy his friend Uzziah they had grown
[48:51] up together and so he come to this year
[48:54] and that says a lot in the Scripture it
[48:56] says a a lot about what's what's going
[48:58] to happen as Isaiah said in the year
[49:01] that King Uzziah died someone a friend
[49:04] had gone on and and he had rebelled and
[49:07] he had took taken a different direction
[49:10] that even Isaiah didn't catch what was
[49:12] going to go on in his life he he took a
[49:14] different direction but it was a good
[49:17] thing because he said in the year that
[49:19] he died that would seem like a bad thing
[49:21] but the only good thing about it is that
[49:23] it ran Isaiah towards the temple and it
[49:27] ran him into the temple and he says in
[49:29] the year that that happened I saw the
[49:34] Lord in this year this tragic thing
[49:37] happened but it there was a good thing
[49:38] that come out of it because I ran
[49:40] towards the Lord and I saw the Lord and
[49:43] he caught a
[49:45] vision of the
[49:47] Lord can you say praise the Lord praise
[49:49] the Lord and sometimes we have certain
[49:52] things happen in our life that we don't
[49:55] understand or maybe it's very hard to go
[49:58] through and uh certain situations it
[50:00] might be a domestic situation or it
[50:02] might be a church uh tension situation
[50:06] and and don't be fooled all the young
[50:07] people see this thing going on in the
[50:09] church or going on in the in the message
[50:11] or whatever they're not fooled they
[50:13] watch things they see things and there's
[50:15] some good there's a lot of good that
[50:16] happens but sometimes the devil's
[50:18] working and there's negative things and
[50:20] don't think the young people don't see
[50:22] that they don't they don't see that
[50:23] going on we're not going to pretend that
[50:25] it doesn't go on but you see sometimes
[50:28] things happen in our lives that are they
[50:31] bring an end to something they they they
[50:33] they bring something that we didn't
[50:35] expect it to happen but always be
[50:37] looking for the Lord and always be
[50:40] running towards the Lord during those
[50:42] times because God may have something
[50:44] better for you down the
[50:47] road so sometimes it's a loss of a
[50:50] friend sometimes things can happen and
[50:52] we may may not even like what happens
[50:54] but often it turns out the very best
[50:57] thing that can happen to us God may have
[51:00] something better in mind let me say it
[51:02] this way God always has something better
[51:04] in mind can I get an
[51:08] amen the god that we serve always has
[51:11] something better in mind for you than
[51:14] what you have
[51:15] now the god that we serve always has
[51:19] something better down the road so now in
[51:23] our trials in our misunderstandings in
[51:25] our things in our life process it may be
[51:27] a loss of a friend it may be a loss of a
[51:30] relationship it may be breaking up I
[51:32] don't know what what could take place
[51:35] but we must always be careful that we're
[51:37] not realizing what God can do during
[51:41] those times now you know I'll just use
[51:43] an example when we had years ago when we
[51:45] had a lot of people maybe exiting and
[51:47] people going this way and that way and
[51:49] bringing seeds of Doubt Upon Our
[51:51] precious message when that happened you
[51:54] know the good thing that come out of it
[51:55] is it drove people to find out what they
[51:58] [Music]
[52:00] believed can you say it's a bad thing to
[52:02] lose people but it drove people to get
[52:05] in the word and get closer to Christ and
[52:08] find out what their Foundation is matter
[52:11] of fact my daughter that song actually
[52:12] came out of that time where things were
[52:15] uncertain and people exiting and
[52:17] different things that song came out of
[52:19] that because it drives you to realize
[52:21] what Foundation you're on and to make a
[52:23] declaration your truth is what I follow
[52:25] it'll still be true tomorrow and what I
[52:28] believe is not the works of any
[52:31] man this is anchored in God's God's
[52:34] stability and God's faithfulness to his
[52:37] people and in this generation he sent a
[52:39] message because he was faithful to God's
[52:41] people the message is exactly what we
[52:44] needed amen but sometimes out of our
[52:47] trials and sometimes out of things that
[52:48] we lose uh God always has something
[52:51] better he can remove things out of our
[52:53] life but then he can bring something
[52:55] better and we're thinking I want that I
[52:57] want that I want this but he can have a
[52:59] better life for you and you think you
[53:01] have it good but he has something better
[53:03] in store I love a god like
[53:07] that I love to serve a God that I that
[53:11] the expectations can be high because he
[53:14] has something better for
[53:15] us young people he's got something
[53:18] better for
[53:20] you young people he has great things in
[53:23] store for you I has not seen or ear have
[53:27] heard what he has prepared for them that
[53:31] love him and it's just that we love him
[53:33] you know got to go through a whole
[53:35] seminar of something it's those that
[53:37] really love him and it's the people that
[53:39] love him really love him I have not seen
[53:42] what he's prepared for them I can serve
[53:45] a god like that I can love a god like
[53:47] that the expectation is high Bible says
[53:51] every good and perfect gift comes from
[53:53] the Father scripture says Jesus said I
[53:56] come come that you might have life but
[53:58] not just life I come that you might have
[54:01] life more
[54:03] abundant I can serve a god like that I
[54:06] can fall in love with a god like that
[54:09] that he not only wants us to have life
[54:11] but he wants us to have Abundant
[54:15] Life oh blessed be his name Hebrews says
[54:19] about the Old Testament Saints and these
[54:21] all having obtained a good report
[54:23] through faith receive not the promise
[54:26] God God having provided some better
[54:29] thing can I get an amen some better
[54:33] thing for us look how those Heroes of
[54:36] the Old Testament my what they but we we
[54:39] we we we learned about them in Sunday
[54:41] school and they just my there're just
[54:43] wonderful people and what they had they
[54:45] had God but yet he says they're waiting
[54:47] on us they can't be perfect without us
[54:50] and all that was held up because why God
[54:52] had something better for us God had
[54:55] something better for you
[54:57] amen I love a god like that so there's
[55:00] good and there's
[55:01] better and uh I would rather have that
[55:03] which is better I'd rather have a life
[55:05] that's better in fact when you surrender
[55:07] to the Lord God has his very best in
[55:10] mind for you whatever you can come up
[55:13] with will never be as great as what God
[55:17] can give
[55:19] you sir if you're looking for a wife
[55:22] which a lot of you are young you
[55:24] shouldn't be looking for a wife but if
[55:26] you're looking for one you can come up
[55:28] with a lot but what God has in mind is
[55:31] better yes sir looking for a husband uh
[55:35] you can come up with a lot of things but
[55:36] what God has in mind is better that's
[55:39] right and it's the best for you that's
[55:41] right can you say praise the
[55:45] Lord breakups can be bad and I just
[55:47] looking at Isaiah's life here and so God
[55:50] takes this close friend off of the scene
[55:52] he gets lifted up in Pride he takes a
[55:54] direction and your friends will do that
[55:56] sometimes they'll take a direction
[55:57] you're going you know I I don't know why
[55:59] he's taking that direction we were
[56:00] buddies we were friends we were and we
[56:02] were honoring God and we were serving
[56:04] the lord we were on the front row
[56:06] together we went to camps together and
[56:08] then sometimes that that friend just
[56:10] starts to take a turn they get lifted up
[56:13] in Pride or they take a turn in another
[56:14] Direction and you're feeling
[56:15] uncomfortable with you what what's going
[56:17] on and and and so there has to be a a
[56:20] breakup sometimes and sometimes the
[56:22] breakup Your World falls apart it's a
[56:25] difficult thing I want remind you that
[56:27] early on in Abraham's life who is our
[56:29] Father Abraham he had to order a
[56:31] separation from family they were there
[56:34] was contention started to happen because
[56:36] lot and his wife's heart had got their
[56:38] eyes on towards the world and so they
[56:40] didn't know what the tension but God
[56:41] said God ordered a separation Abraham
[56:43] said I love you lot I love you but but
[56:45] you're going to have to choose a way
[56:47] there's going to be have to be a
[56:48] separation and we don't like that
[56:50] because we get emotionally get CH
[56:52] attached but you know what some of the
[56:54] best things that can happen is sometimes
[56:56] a separation from the wrong
[56:59] friend right from the wrong
[57:02] influence and if you're not willing to
[57:04] separate and God's leading you that way
[57:06] then you might run into more trouble but
[57:08] sometimes God is loving you to separate
[57:11] that relationship because he's got
[57:13] something better in mind for
[57:18] you Abraham and so you know breakups you
[57:22] know you have a a boyfriend break up
[57:25] with you sometime and we've dealt and
[57:27] talked to a lot of young people and we
[57:29] have some in our church and they form
[57:30] relationships and there's nothing wrong
[57:32] with that but if if it starts to have
[57:34] fruit of the wrong thing then some and
[57:36] it gets worse sometimes then you got to
[57:38] step back and look and I give them
[57:39] advice if they're asking for my advice I
[57:41] give them say listen this this this
[57:43] Union is not producing the right thing
[57:46] this is not a good thing and then
[57:47] there's a breakup and it's all terrible
[57:49] breakup especially breakups are terrible
[57:52] if you've quickly given your heart too
[57:54] much to that person
[57:56] because the way the heart works is that
[57:59] you God made us a certain way and so if
[58:01] you really quickly bond in the wrong way
[58:04] I try to teach young people there is a
[58:05] bonding that should happen first and
[58:07] that's spiritually you both have the
[58:09] Holy Ghost you can Fellowship on what
[58:11] the Lord's showing you you have a
[58:13] connection and a Oneness about the Lord
[58:15] first you connect in the soul first the
[58:19] world's got it all backwards and they
[58:22] connect physically
[58:23] first the first night they're connecting
[58:26] physically the devil has messed it all
[58:28] up but you connect spiritually first
[58:31] with that person something happens and
[58:33] then as you grow in your relationship
[58:34] and courtship then you begin to bond
[58:36] emotionally and begin to talk about
[58:38] different things and you start getting
[58:40] closer and things and so that's a real
[58:42] that can be a real good thing if you're
[58:44] going on it's the will of God but if you
[58:45] make Bonds in your emotions and your
[58:48] mind too quickly and it's not the will
[58:50] of God it's awful hard to break those
[58:53] bonds that's right and why is that
[58:55] because that's the way God's made us
[58:57] he's built us to bond with a mate
[59:00] someday spiritually emotionally and
[59:04] physically after the wedding
[59:07] day I just want to I just want to bring
[59:10] that up the bonding if we if we all
[59:13] forgot the bonding physically is after
[59:16] you said I
[59:18] do I should get better amens than that
[59:21] now now this is still the truth right
[59:23] the world has messed it all up it's
[59:25] messed with our mind but listen a couple
[59:27] should Bond spiritually first matter of
[59:30] fact brother BR says you better get a
[59:31] boy with the Holy Ghost he'll mess your
[59:33] life up it'll be hell on Earth for you
[59:36] if you have to wait until you're older
[59:38] you wait until you get that boy that's
[59:40] got the Holy Ghost until you find that
[59:43] girl that has the Holy
[59:45] Ghost that's right cuz your worst
[59:49] miserable day as a single person is
[59:53] better than a wrong marriage
[59:56] right
[1:00:00] woo take your worst day of being single
[1:00:03] and said no I don't I don't have anybody
[1:00:07] I'm a girl and I'm becoming an old maid
[1:00:10] well how old are you well I'm 20 years
[1:00:12] old and I feel like an old maid and
[1:00:15] there's nobody out there for me there's
[1:00:17] nobody I've had them tell me this in my
[1:00:18] office there's nobody out there I just
[1:00:21] feel like I'm going to get left out and
[1:00:23] all my friends are getting married and
[1:00:26] and I just I I feel I know what it is to
[1:00:29] be despised and rejected of all
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:34] men I'm feeling this right now all I can
[1:00:37] be myself right I'm already doing it
[1:00:41] so I know what it is there was one older
[1:00:44] girl she was uh about 40 years old and
[1:00:47] she wasn't married yet 35 I think and
[1:00:49] she said you know what I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:00:52] actually making a request there's going
[1:00:54] to be no men bearers at my funeral and
[1:00:58] they said why because they wouldn't take
[1:01:00] me out when I was alive and they're not
[1:01:02] going to take me out when I'm
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:11] dead oh and then there's a breakup and
[1:01:15] because you form bonds the breakup is
[1:01:18] harder you didn't give yourself no
[1:01:21] exits you didn't say let's let's just
[1:01:23] take this slow and see if it's the will
[1:01:25] of God first
[1:01:26] young people through social media they
[1:01:29] can move pretty quick in a relationship
[1:01:31] and parents don't know about it Pastor
[1:01:33] don't know about it you know we got guys
[1:01:35] saying I love you within the first two
[1:01:37] weeks or third
[1:01:38] week I'm just going to say it those are
[1:01:41] strong words that's right they're not to
[1:01:43] be cheapened that's right and I don't
[1:01:45] think that you should use that term to
[1:01:47] somebody that you don't know you're
[1:01:49] going to make a commitment
[1:01:54] to and it's it's quiet because it
[1:01:57] becomes normal to just I love you I I
[1:02:01] think I love you you
[1:02:04] think you better know and all these guys
[1:02:08] are making these commitments with girls
[1:02:09] and nobody knows what's going on and
[1:02:11] they're saying I see a future with you
[1:02:13] and all these other comments I can just
[1:02:15] see the vision of us together and he's
[1:02:17] only known her two weeks he don't have a
[1:02:19] job he barely brings his Bible to
[1:02:22] church and he's he's making what I call
[1:02:26] bonding comments with that
[1:02:29] girl and I think if you make bonding
[1:02:32] comments I think you be ought to be
[1:02:35] ready to back it up with a
[1:02:38] commitment and if you don't if you're
[1:02:40] not ready you have no business playing
[1:02:43] with that girl's heart girl you have no
[1:02:46] business playing with that guy's heart
[1:02:49] that's right because girls can do the
[1:02:51] same thing oh they get all Twitter baed
[1:02:54] and oh I think he likes well how long
[1:02:57] have you known him I just met him at
[1:02:59] church but I'm
[1:03:03] going he came through the cafeteria and
[1:03:06] I dropped my my scarf and he picked it
[1:03:08] up and he gave it to me and walked off
[1:03:12] and I think he's the
[1:03:17] one he's he's so
[1:03:21] Christlike I see that character in
[1:03:24] him what's his name I don't know but I
[1:03:27] just feel like this is the one girls are
[1:03:30] just as bad they're worse and giving
[1:03:32] their heart too quickly to
[1:03:33] somebody you know a guy just says a few
[1:03:36] things and she's ready to order the
[1:03:37] flowers for the
[1:03:42] wedding
[1:03:44] sometimes sometimes a breakup as hard as
[1:03:47] it is is the best thing that can happen
[1:03:50] to you abely because God has a blueprint
[1:03:53] for your life and if that's not the one
[1:03:56] I went with a couple girls and I I
[1:03:58] actually thought this was going to go
[1:03:59] the right direction and God just stepped
[1:04:01] in and if I hadn't been obedient and
[1:04:03] follow through with my prayer and say I
[1:04:05] got I want your will Lord I'm neutral
[1:04:06] I'm neutral you better be neutral when
[1:04:08] you say it because when God orders a
[1:04:10] separation then then and here's another
[1:04:12] thing you treated her like a sister you
[1:04:15] treated each other like a brother and
[1:04:16] sister and you have no regrets to the
[1:04:17] relationship you don't have to go and
[1:04:19] repent of a bunch of stuff you keep it
[1:04:21] General you keep it brotherly sisterly
[1:04:24] until God leads you to the next step and
[1:04:27] you can step on a firm foundation that I
[1:04:29] believe I can step into courtship and
[1:04:31] step into engagement because God has God
[1:04:34] has led me to this
[1:04:37] person this is none of this is in my
[1:04:39] notes but I'm giving it out
[1:04:43] anyway but if you give your heart too
[1:04:46] quickly uh and then there's a breakup my
[1:04:49] it's just terrible and people go through
[1:04:51] distraught depressing times you know
[1:04:53] when there was a breakup with a boy in
[1:04:55] the church breakup with a girl and the
[1:04:57] girl's going through weeks of depression
[1:04:58] she's on the couch and she's she's you
[1:05:01] know eating ice cream every night she's
[1:05:02] eating gallons of ice cream and you know
[1:05:05] and she tries to call the guy and says
[1:05:07] you you know you're the reason for the
[1:05:09] Teardrops On My Guitar right now and you
[1:05:12] know and and then he calls back and said
[1:05:15] I don't really care here's a quarter
[1:05:16] call somebody who cares he's singing
[1:05:19] that back to her and I can't believe you
[1:05:21] treat me that way we I thought this was
[1:05:23] it he said because you you you formed
[1:05:25] bonds too quickly that's right and I
[1:05:28] don't care how much you think sometimes
[1:05:29] it's the right thing let God give you
[1:05:32] time to show you that it's the right
[1:05:36] thing one of God's greatest assets to
[1:05:39] show his will is
[1:05:43] time and the more time you can give
[1:05:45] something the more he can give you green
[1:05:48] lights or red lights and if you get red
[1:05:51] lights you better
[1:05:53] stop it's a good idea
[1:05:56] it's going to be an
[1:06:00] accident
[1:06:02] Hallelujah sometimes if you're listening
[1:06:05] God is calling for a separation and it's
[1:06:07] the best thing that can happen there are
[1:06:09] other breaks up breakups in life besides
[1:06:11] a guy and girl though God orders a
[1:06:13] separation from Abraham God orders
[1:06:15] breakups breakups from influences that
[1:06:18] are not good for you Uzziah was turned
[1:06:20] out to be not a good influence for
[1:06:22] Isaiah and he was blinded by this
[1:06:24] friendship that he was getting off track
[1:06:26] and as long as he stayed friends with
[1:06:28] him he could I would just go and say it
[1:06:30] both of these men needed a vision of the
[1:06:33] Lord they were good boys but they needed
[1:06:36] to catch God's
[1:06:38] vision and i' say that until you catch
[1:06:40] God's Vision you better be leery of
[1:06:42] relationships and friendships that lead
[1:06:44] you away God may be ordering that
[1:06:46] because why when God ordered separation
[1:06:48] from Uzziah and actually took him out of
[1:06:51] Isaiah's life Isaiah and this is what
[1:06:53] the prophet said Isaiah got his eyes on
[1:06:55] off of Uzziah yes sir can I get an amen
[1:06:59] once he got his eyes off of that
[1:07:01] influence and off of Uzziah then he can
[1:07:04] run to the temple and get his eyes on
[1:07:06] the Lord and actually catch a
[1:07:08] vision young people you need to catch
[1:07:11] the
[1:07:11] vision the vision for this hour the
[1:07:14] vision of the message first you got to
[1:07:16] catch God's Vision both of these men
[1:07:19] young men needed to catch the vision
[1:07:22] right many young people in our message
[1:07:24] need to catch the vision they're good
[1:07:26] kids they're good kids God bless you for
[1:07:29] your obedience to what the message says
[1:07:32] but you if you don't catch the vision of
[1:07:35] this
[1:07:35] message then it'll never be like it
[1:07:38] really should
[1:07:40] be God actually in his grace removed
[1:07:43] Uzziah out of the eyes of Isaiah so he
[1:07:47] could catch a vision of the person of
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:50] Lord
[1:07:52] hallelujah and he can see how to
[1:07:54] approach the Lord he could see those
[1:07:56] things breakups can be other than just
[1:07:59] guys and girls God orders breakups
[1:08:01] sometimes he we break he breaks us up
[1:08:04] from emotionally connecting with the
[1:08:07] wrong things God orders breakups from
[1:08:09] what you're feeding
[1:08:12] on you're feeding on the wrong thing on
[1:08:15] your phone and it's an influence don't
[1:08:18] tell me it's not an
[1:08:19] influence don't tell me it keeps you
[1:08:21] from being closer to the Lord there's
[1:08:24] certain things on your phone that take
[1:08:25] home in private you have it in privacy
[1:08:27] but listen sometimes God through the
[1:08:30] ministry speaks to your heart and he's
[1:08:31] ordering a separation or a backing off
[1:08:34] because that thing is influencing your
[1:08:36] life that's right and if you're addicted
[1:08:39] to it which by the way they're calling
[1:08:40] that an addiction now right it's not
[1:08:43] drugs and and uh you know all these
[1:08:46] other things but they're calling these
[1:08:48] things addictions they're actually
[1:08:49] addicted to it they're addicted to their
[1:08:51] phone they're addicted to social media
[1:08:54] it's a new addiction God doesn't want us
[1:08:56] to be addicted to anything except
[1:08:59] him can I get an
[1:09:02] amen Paul said I won't be under the
[1:09:05] power some things might be expedient for
[1:09:07] me but all he says all things are lawful
[1:09:09] some things are not expedient but I will
[1:09:11] not be brought under the power of any of
[1:09:14] those
[1:09:15] things and if you're being brought under
[1:09:17] the power and influence of something
[1:09:19] that's where it becomes wrong and God
[1:09:21] orders a breakup not just from guys and
[1:09:23] girls sometimes but a breakup for you
[1:09:25] feeding on the wrong thing and break up
[1:09:27] the emotional part that goes with it and
[1:09:30] you might cry you might Rebel for a time
[1:09:32] but the ones God orders these
[1:09:34] separations it's a good thing and most
[1:09:36] of the time he has something better on
[1:09:39] the horizon for you when we grow up we
[1:09:41] start oh I love this I love this God
[1:09:44] gave me this the other night when we
[1:09:45] begin to grow up and really love the
[1:09:47] Lord more deeper we start thanking God
[1:09:51] for not only what he gives us but for
[1:09:53] what he takes away
[1:09:56] really
[1:09:59] good there's a song about it somebody
[1:10:01] wrote it and I I don't know it but I
[1:10:03] pulled it up when we start thanking God
[1:10:05] for what he took out of our Lives amen
[1:10:08] and not just thanking for what he gives
[1:10:10] us amen we're starting to grow up
[1:10:13] because he will take things out of our
[1:10:15] Lives
[1:10:16] amen he will well the first thing is
[1:10:18] take
[1:10:20] sin aren't you glad he took your
[1:10:23] sin I'm glad he took that that away from
[1:10:25] me wash it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:10:28] there's a host of things that not God
[1:10:30] doesn't give us that God takes away from
[1:10:32] us right and we cry and we hate to lose
[1:10:35] we lose a loved one we lose a friend we
[1:10:37] lose the things of the world God Cuts
[1:10:39] those things from our life and we
[1:10:41] shouldn't be crying we should be
[1:10:42] thanking God we should say Lord if this
[1:10:45] draws me closer to you then I'm glad you
[1:10:48] cut that out of my
[1:10:51] life oh I love that praise the Lord we
[1:10:54] thank God for not only what he gives us
[1:10:56] but what he he takes away because God in
[1:11:00] his Loving Grace as I was preaching to
[1:11:02] my church this morning God in his loving
[1:11:04] grace is constantly molding us and
[1:11:08] making us he won't give up on us and we
[1:11:10] Rebel sometimes and we don't want his
[1:11:12] forming in his hands to form you know my
[1:11:15] daughter Ellie is here tonight is she
[1:11:16] awake my daughter Ellie I play with her
[1:11:19] all the time Josh and Ry are building a
[1:11:21] home so they're living with us and
[1:11:22] that's a benefit because I get Ellie to
[1:11:24] wake me up every morning in my own house
[1:11:27] and it's a lot of fun but we do a lot of
[1:11:29] things together don't we Ellie and one
[1:11:30] of the things is we get into this thing
[1:11:32] of of playing with
[1:11:34] slime I don't know why slime is so
[1:11:36] important to these young kids but it's
[1:11:38] become a phenomena slime she wants to
[1:11:41] watch YouTube videos of people I don't
[1:11:43] get it but you know what I do it and I
[1:11:46] play slime with her because she she's my
[1:11:50] granddaughter and but there's this new
[1:11:52] thing and they just love to watch people
[1:11:54] I said what's what the psychological
[1:11:56] thing going on here because these V
[1:11:58] these videos are so popular people with
[1:11:59] their hands in slime just just doing
[1:12:03] things with it and I'm going what is the
[1:12:06] deal she likes it and also she likes to
[1:12:09] play SL so we've been playing quite a
[1:12:10] bit and the other day I was playing with
[1:12:12] her and so I she likes to make snakes
[1:12:14] and different things with it I lately
[1:12:16] been uh building pyramids with a little
[1:12:18] piece of slime and I you know she
[1:12:21] doesn't know what a pyramid is but Papa
[1:12:23] that looks pretty nice and so she so but
[1:12:25] when I'm finding I'm learning something
[1:12:26] through this which is a good thing
[1:12:28] because I don't see the value of slime
[1:12:29] at
[1:12:31] all but the Lord's showing me the longer
[1:12:34] I spin with that and the longer I keep
[1:12:36] forming
[1:12:38] it that
[1:12:42] pyramid if I just leave it but if I
[1:12:44] spend an hour with it and I keep gently
[1:12:47] just touching my finger on and just
[1:12:49] moving getting all that and making it
[1:12:51] smoother it gets smoother and smoother
[1:12:53] and it starts to war and I'm no artist
[1:12:54] you know can't do this stuff I don't
[1:12:56] know how to take a I don't have to draw
[1:12:57] a picture of anything but if I keep
[1:12:59] working at this slime it really starts
[1:13:01] to look really really good and it looks
[1:13:04] good because Ellie says it looks
[1:13:08] good I make pyramids don't I honey I
[1:13:11] make pyramids does it look good it it
[1:13:13] looks good and but as as you allow God
[1:13:16] to keep forming you and the more time
[1:13:19] you give even as a young person to keep
[1:13:22] doing his
[1:13:23] work it's starts to look
[1:13:26] beautiful
[1:13:28] right said w wow I I start complimenting
[1:13:31] myself this looks pretty nice this this
[1:13:34] is a nice pyramid you know I could start
[1:13:36] doing this for a
[1:13:38] living I said because I took time with
[1:13:40] it I said ell how you how do you like
[1:13:44] this and you know what she does she
[1:13:46] comes over and she
[1:13:50] goes she sure does so I got to start all
[1:13:54] over
[1:13:56] I wonder if God sometimes takes what
[1:13:58] we're forming and he just
[1:14:01] goes splurts
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:04] out so let me do this let me do this and
[1:14:07] he starts over again that's the loving
[1:14:10] God isn't it he forms us he molds us and
[1:14:13] he takes away things that are not good
[1:14:16] for us young people never underestimate
[1:14:18] what God's doing in your life to take
[1:14:20] things away from you to get you away
[1:14:22] from influence that evangelist come in
[1:14:24] and blasted these things and blasted
[1:14:26] some of these things and this worldly
[1:14:28] dress and all this don't don't look at
[1:14:30] it bad it may be God speaking to you to
[1:14:32] shed something all your life so you'll
[1:14:34] run towards God and you have a closer
[1:14:36] relationship with him through the
[1:14:39] message we have had light shed on this
[1:14:41] story of Isaiah and Uzziah I won't get
[1:14:43] into it tonight I I'll just read one
[1:14:45] quote but it's more than a story Isaiah
[1:14:47] and Uzziah is more than a story and it
[1:14:49] proved that when the prophet talked
[1:14:50] about it our life is hidden here in this
[1:14:53] mystery of Isaiah and Uzziah
[1:14:55] uh our life is hidden when we read the
[1:14:57] Old Testament when we read the New
[1:14:59] Testament when we read these types and
[1:15:01] shadows Christ and his bride Christ is
[1:15:04] the word Christ is the book and the
[1:15:07] bride is the words in the book so when
[1:15:09] we read these stories this one I'm
[1:15:11] talking about tonight our name our life
[1:15:14] our spiritual life is written in these
[1:15:17] Mysteries that's why brother BR takes
[1:15:19] this message influence so much our day
[1:15:22] is being lived out in the written
[1:15:24] stories of the Bible our days being
[1:15:26] living out and under this Min uh mystery
[1:15:29] it's real simple and that is we must
[1:15:32] catch the vision of the
[1:15:36] Lord seeing the Lord is above all things
[1:15:42] am that's right good amen is that simple
[1:15:47] tonight seeing the Lord is above all
[1:15:52] friendships it's above all entertainment
[1:15:55] it's above all things in your life that
[1:15:58] you catch a vision of the
[1:16:00] Lord changed his life forever changed
[1:16:04] his vision he knew what he was doing he
[1:16:05] knew his commission and he went about
[1:16:07] that Commission because he seen a vision
[1:16:09] of the Lord I think it's a wonderful
[1:16:11] thing two men one called to be a prophet
[1:16:14] one born a prophet and then one called
[1:16:17] to be a king and they were good guys in
[1:16:18] Fellowship they were working together
[1:16:20] they played together they grew up as
[1:16:21] boys attending church together maybe
[1:16:23] going to camps together and these two do
[1:16:26] not have a history of being in the world
[1:16:28] but in the ranks of the true people of
[1:16:30] Jehovah this is an example of many of
[1:16:32] you young people they're not worldly
[1:16:34] guys that grew up in the world they grew
[1:16:36] up in the ranks of those that believed
[1:16:38] in Jehovah God and they were friends and
[1:16:40] they were both doing it and actually
[1:16:42] Isaiah could see God honored his
[1:16:45] kingship of Uzziah because he was
[1:16:48] obedient to the Lord it was all good it
[1:16:50] was going good and God even though
[1:16:52] Uzziah didn't have a vision even though
[1:16:54] that there wasn't fur something further
[1:16:56] his life God honored what he did young
[1:16:58] people God will honor your respect for
[1:17:00] the
[1:17:02] word even until you see things God will
[1:17:05] honor that but I just want to say it's
[1:17:07] not quite enough until you catch the
[1:17:11] vision of why you do
[1:17:14] it it's not deep enough yet it's not
[1:17:17] good enough yet until we catch the
[1:17:20] vision and so these two don't have a
[1:17:23] history of being in the world but
[1:17:24] they're but they're both in a position
[1:17:27] that they would come into both being
[1:17:29] blessed and and and and then they come
[1:17:31] into their positions very rare positions
[1:17:34] only there was only 16 uh Old Testament
[1:17:37] prophets and there's 42 Kings and so now
[1:17:40] these two young men had the potential
[1:17:42] now to enter into these positions that
[1:17:44] were very rare 16 prophets and 42 Kings
[1:17:48] and they're called uh to a special
[1:17:51] calling young people tonight you have a
[1:17:55] special
[1:17:56] calling you have been chosen by
[1:18:00] God God has a deeper purpose for your
[1:18:03] life say well I'm only 13 years old I
[1:18:06] don't understand all this but listen let
[1:18:08] me tell you God has a blueprint for your
[1:18:10] life God has a purpose for your life God
[1:18:13] has something for you to do God wants
[1:18:16] you to catch the vision for this hour
[1:18:18] because I believe you're a part of that
[1:18:21] vision and you have to catch it to see
[1:18:23] what God wants you to do but there's a
[1:18:24] lot of potential when I'm in youth
[1:18:26] meetings there's so much potential and
[1:18:28] there's so much energy there's so many
[1:18:30] things that can be done for the kingdom
[1:18:32] of God can you say Amen not to waste a
[1:18:35] life going for the things of the world
[1:18:37] that's a waste everybody else is doing
[1:18:39] that everybody else is part of those
[1:18:42] statistics I don't want to be a
[1:18:43] statistic of the world I don't want to
[1:18:45] be I want to dare to be different God
[1:18:48] has a different calling of man and when
[1:18:49] you compare yourself with the kid at
[1:18:51] school or sometimes even somebody around
[1:18:53] you and say I want to be like that I
[1:18:55] want you go through those early years of
[1:18:56] the teens and you're having an identity
[1:18:58] crisis you don't know who you are yet
[1:19:00] and that's a struggling time for a team
[1:19:02] that's the best time to say Lord you
[1:19:04] show me Who I Am Lord let me look in
[1:19:06] this book of redemption which by the way
[1:19:08] this book of redemption that was that
[1:19:10] had the seals off of it it's the book of
[1:19:11] redemption but it's the book of identity
[1:19:14] yes
[1:19:15] sir that book is a book of
[1:19:18] identity you start to look in that
[1:19:20] message and that word that's been open
[1:19:22] you start to see who you really are you
[1:19:24] start to see your TR and girls will find
[1:19:26] their true identity as a Godly girl in
[1:19:29] that book of redemption guys will find
[1:19:32] what a real man is a real man of God in
[1:19:34] that book of identity because what God
[1:19:36] did as Satan took 6,000 years and
[1:19:39] destroyed the image of a woman destroyed
[1:19:42] the image of a man God said I will
[1:19:46] restore that's right look what God has
[1:19:49] blessed us with with this book of
[1:19:51] identity that we can feed on right in
[1:19:53] the middle of people not even knowing
[1:19:55] whether they're a guy or girl or
[1:19:58] not can't even figure out which bathroom
[1:20:01] to go to how Satan has Twisted the minds
[1:20:04] of young people and even young children
[1:20:07] they're teaching it in the schools I say
[1:20:09] we needed something we needed God to
[1:20:12] come and give us what a real man is what
[1:20:15] a real woman is can you say
[1:20:18] Amen oh this message is dos and don'ts
[1:20:21] this no no no you missed it you missed
[1:20:23] it our God knew what we needed in this
[1:20:25] hour I say God knew what the young
[1:20:28] people
[1:20:29] needed this is the book of identity well
[1:20:32] how do you know it was a book of
[1:20:33] identity because when it was opened
[1:20:35] they've all began to worship number one
[1:20:38] can you say Amen we've been redeemed
[1:20:39] back to God and thou Hast made us Kings
[1:20:43] and
[1:20:44] Priests it's a book of identity I'm not
[1:20:48] some something of the world God's making
[1:20:51] me into something God's molding
[1:20:55] me into
[1:20:57] rulership and that means that the world
[1:21:00] doesn't control me through the Holy
[1:21:02] Ghost I control the
[1:21:05] world come on now friends come on you
[1:21:07] know the word the title deed Adam lost
[1:21:11] it he had control of things instead of
[1:21:13] things controlling him when he lost that
[1:21:15] title deed he lost all that power to be
[1:21:18] able to control things he lost it but
[1:21:20] when the seals were open God's handing
[1:21:22] that book back to the people
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:26] again Redemption comes into the power of
[1:21:30] things not controlling
[1:21:32] us but us controlling
[1:21:37] things and you young people are blessed
[1:21:39] in this generation because this isn't
[1:21:42] just a words of a seventh grade
[1:21:44] education and just that preacher that's
[1:21:46] preaching it every Sunday you got to
[1:21:48] catch the vision because this is far
[1:21:51] deeper it's deeper than just a prophet
[1:21:54] it's about Christ the person of Christ
[1:21:56] it's deeper than just a preacher it's
[1:21:59] the vision for this hour this message is
[1:22:02] a vision it's God's Vision so I pray
[1:22:05] you'd raise your hand tonight say God
[1:22:07] help me to catch the
[1:22:09] vision that's my message to you tonight
[1:22:11] Lord let me everything is catching that
[1:22:13] Vision seeing the Lord of this message
[1:22:16] there's the message but then there's the
[1:22:17] lord of the
[1:22:19] message there's the Christ of the
[1:22:22] message and some people get all dis
[1:22:24] disappointed and the reason is is
[1:22:26] because they don't see the Christ in
[1:22:28] this message they only see the outside
[1:22:31] of it they see it as a dress code they
[1:22:34] see it as I don't know what all people
[1:22:36] see it as but God has to give you a
[1:22:38] vision of Christ the
[1:22:40] Lord he's the Lord of this
[1:22:44] message praise be to
[1:22:47] God I'm excited about what the Lord is
[1:22:50] doing I'm
[1:22:52] excited so the these two boys had a
[1:22:55] really good history to start but later
[1:22:57] things changed the prophet praised the
[1:22:59] early life of yiah Uzziah he was a hero
[1:23:02] to him but then Pride came in he become
[1:23:04] self- secured self uzai become
[1:23:07] self-willed self-centered God can't find
[1:23:09] a way to the heart when a man becomes
[1:23:11] self-centered and lifted up in Pride
[1:23:14] become know it alls I know more than
[1:23:16] everybody I know more than preacher I've
[1:23:18] had 18yar olds tell me and they know
[1:23:20] things they know more than their parents
[1:23:21] they know more than the pastor now
[1:23:23] they're going to tell everybody what to
[1:23:24] do I figured it all
[1:23:27] out you go that direction too far and
[1:23:30] you move your heart away from God
[1:23:31] dealing with
[1:23:33] you because you don't know
[1:23:36] everything what's the kid come into
[1:23:38] early teens here and he said you
[1:23:40] concluded my dad doesn't know anything
[1:23:41] he doesn't know a thing still saying it
[1:23:44] at 21 yeah it's about that whole thing I
[1:23:47] got two sons and you know I I was
[1:23:50] talking about this last week in Edmonton
[1:23:52] I thought boy it's just all the stages
[1:23:54] they all go through and God gives us
[1:23:56] Grace just to deal with all the seasons
[1:23:57] and the stages there's nothing wrong
[1:23:59] with seasons and stages Jesus went
[1:24:02] through all of
[1:24:03] them Jesus was a teenager Jesus was a
[1:24:06] baby why didn't God come just send Jesus
[1:24:09] go right to Calvary because he had to
[1:24:10] live out what we would live out Lord you
[1:24:14] ought to be glad young people when you
[1:24:16] go to pray struggling as a teenager you
[1:24:18] go to pray Jesus understands you because
[1:24:21] he's been here done that got the T-shirt
[1:24:24] yeah
[1:24:25] yeah he's been here yeah you ought to be
[1:24:29] thankful when we go to pray and wonder
[1:24:31] if God understands you he understands
[1:24:33] because he was tempted in every Point
[1:24:34] like we so when we go to pray he
[1:24:37] understands what you're going through he
[1:24:39] understands depression he understands
[1:24:40] being tempted by women he understands
[1:24:42] being temp tempted by the devil so we
[1:24:45] can go to him because he lived out every
[1:24:48] stage of life that we would go through
[1:24:50] that would be difficult he lived that
[1:24:52] out so that he can understand
[1:24:54] his people can you say amen and so so
[1:24:57] now we should be following him not
[1:25:00] become self-centered like Uzziah did and
[1:25:02] when he did it turned bad he put himself
[1:25:04] in the wrong Authority you know the
[1:25:06] story but one thing about this they both
[1:25:08] lacked the vision of the Lord they still
[1:25:11] had not caught the vision of the reality
[1:25:12] of God they both needed that in their
[1:25:15] lives you can be a great young man and a
[1:25:17] great young woman doing good things but
[1:25:20] something deeper is to catch the vision
[1:25:22] of this hour the message of of the hour
[1:25:25] the Lord of this hour and when you do it
[1:25:27] will humble you CU When Isaiah caught
[1:25:30] the vision it humbled him and you will
[1:25:33] begin serving the lord in a different
[1:25:35] way and in a deeper
[1:25:37] way praise be to God I'm going to skip
[1:25:39] some of this
[1:25:40] and skip to the end a little bit but
[1:25:43] listen I'll say just one thing we really
[1:25:46] need to make
[1:25:48] sure so many examples I can give not
[1:25:50] just in young people so many examples
[1:25:53] through the years of History this
[1:25:54] message even with preachers you better
[1:25:57] make sure that you have the vision of
[1:26:00] what this message
[1:26:02] is because even preachers can take the
[1:26:04] people off
[1:26:06] track and you look at how they go that
[1:26:08] direction point the people to themselves
[1:26:11] or all these different moves movements
[1:26:13] and sometimes you have to say does that
[1:26:15] man have the real Vision in
[1:26:18] humility of the Lord of this message
[1:26:20] amen yes
[1:26:22] sir hallah huah families unravel
[1:26:26] sometimes they're going good and then
[1:26:28] everything
[1:26:29] unravels and sometimes there just way
[1:26:32] too much religion in something and
[1:26:33] people have not caught the vision yet
[1:26:37] right there's there was a story of a
[1:26:39] girl she she grew up in this message
[1:26:41] even in our area over there she's not
[1:26:42] there now and she grew up in a real it
[1:26:46] wasn't all her fault she grew up in a
[1:26:47] real um inbalanced
[1:26:50] uh picture of the message and it just
[1:26:53] was real rough on her her but then she
[1:26:55] had the opportunity to serve the Lord
[1:26:56] and get past that she didn't she went
[1:26:58] out and I think she had two or three uh
[1:27:01] relationships and the world really
[1:27:03] messed her life up and then she just
[1:27:05] started to run away as far I don't want
[1:27:06] to hear she got bitter I don't want to
[1:27:09] hear Brother braham's name I don't want
[1:27:10] to hear about the Lord she just become
[1:27:12] real bitter about it and she ran for
[1:27:15] probably 10 years she ran from it and
[1:27:17] she said you know what I'm so sick of
[1:27:19] this she was in a certain area still had
[1:27:21] message people I want to go to the
[1:27:22] furthest place away I don't don't even
[1:27:24] want to be around people like this I
[1:27:26] don't want to ever hear it again she
[1:27:29] moves to California and she I think she
[1:27:31] gets a cleaning job at a lady's house
[1:27:35] and she starts cleaning that and then
[1:27:37] one day this lady sits down and she says
[1:27:39] have you ever heard of anybody called
[1:27:41] William
[1:27:48] brandom that's what I try to get away
[1:27:50] from she did she got angry in her heart
[1:27:55] and she goes well well yes you know and
[1:27:57] and then she begins to tell
[1:28:00] unfortunately she begins to tell all of
[1:28:01] her past history and I want to get away
[1:28:04] from that it's a cult she just goes on
[1:28:06] and on but this lady had become so
[1:28:09] positive she didn't even know hardly the
[1:28:11] message yet but she had heard such
[1:28:12] positive things it didn't affect her she
[1:28:15] said well from what I've seen and heard
[1:28:18] uh God's really doing something in my
[1:28:20] life as I keep looking at thisen
[1:28:23] remember now it's not William brandom
[1:28:26] it's she's met
[1:28:29] God and that's the distinction yes sir
[1:28:33] she was already catching the vision this
[1:28:35] is not about a man this is that I need
[1:28:38] God I need the Lord in my life this is
[1:28:40] becoming real to me and you know what
[1:28:42] happened her influence was stronger than
[1:28:44] the girl that grew up in the message
[1:28:46] that didn't have the vision of the
[1:28:49] message and so she through their
[1:28:51] testimony for the love through
[1:28:53] Fellowship she restored this
[1:28:56] girl's confidence and faith in the
[1:28:58] message amen moved back to her area got
[1:29:02] re-baptized and from what I understand
[1:29:05] serving the lord today with all of her
[1:29:09] heart why she caught the
[1:29:11] vision she was blinded by all the stuff
[1:29:14] that happens in our ranks but you can't
[1:29:16] be blinded by what goes on this is more
[1:29:19] than just a a books and tapes this is
[1:29:22] more than William brandham this is
[1:29:24] deeper than that this is the vision of
[1:29:27] this
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:31] hour God brought his vision for this day
[1:29:35] through the mouth of a prophet but now
[1:29:37] that Prophet has done his job went off
[1:29:39] the scene but you young people can still
[1:29:42] catch the
[1:29:47] vision
[1:29:50] amen one great lesson here in Isaiah and
[1:29:53] I'm trying to just you know I I really
[1:29:56] don't know what I'm trying to do I'm
[1:29:57] trying to find a place to end but I I
[1:29:59] trust this is a blessing for the young
[1:30:01] people tonight one of the great lessons
[1:30:03] taught Isaiah and you must learn it
[1:30:05] tonight watching someone else too
[1:30:08] much and depending on somebody else too
[1:30:12] much sir this is a walk with the Lord
[1:30:15] with you and
[1:30:17] God and though you go to the camps and
[1:30:20] though you have friends that's wonderful
[1:30:22] but don't you ever try to go in on the
[1:30:24] coattail or go on your friend and you're
[1:30:27] we're going in together you're not going
[1:30:28] in together unless you have the right
[1:30:30] thing
[1:30:32] yourself you're not going in on the
[1:30:34] coattail of your parents you're not
[1:30:36] going in on the coattail of your pastor
[1:30:38] you're not going in because your pastor
[1:30:40] is is the pastor your dad is the pastor
[1:30:42] you're not going in because you go to
[1:30:44] all the message camps sir that's right
[1:30:49] this is an individual thing between you
[1:30:51] and the Lord this is a vision from the
[1:30:54] Lord you have to see him oh I I remember
[1:30:57] years ago I don't have this in my notes
[1:30:58] but I know this is just may not be
[1:31:00] relevant but it is to me when I one of
[1:31:02] the grandsons of brother bisco years ago
[1:31:04] I was in a I was in a uh a Minister's
[1:31:07] meeting I think you were at one of them
[1:31:08] Brother Sam and I was in that Minister
[1:31:10] meeting and brother Bisal was talking
[1:31:12] about his grandson and all these years
[1:31:14] and he was only about 14 but he says he
[1:31:16] ran to him at the car and all these
[1:31:18] years he's heard these things he grew up
[1:31:20] in it and he says Grandpa Grandpa I see
[1:31:23] it I see see it and he couldn't say
[1:31:26] anything else but I see it Grandpa I see
[1:31:28] what you're trying to say and he was so
[1:31:30] excited well what have you seen I don't
[1:31:32] know I just see
[1:31:33] it he couldn't explain it all but he's
[1:31:36] seen the Lord of this
[1:31:38] message he's he caught something boy 14
[1:31:42] years old that's a
[1:31:44] blessing and he's gone on I could tell
[1:31:47] you his name but he's serve the Lord
[1:31:48] he's uh he's done great in the Kingdom
[1:31:50] of the Lord doing something for the Lord
[1:31:52] but at 14 he said I see
[1:31:55] itl I see everything you're preaching
[1:31:58] and it's not about Grandpa it's about
[1:32:00] the lord of the message that's right I
[1:32:03] saw also the Lord I don't know if I
[1:32:06] might be preaching some people are
[1:32:07] looking at me real funny I don't I'm not
[1:32:09] here to become your enemy I hope I'm
[1:32:11] preaching everything okay and on the
[1:32:13] word of God but listen now don't get mad
[1:32:15] at me listen it might be convicting to
[1:32:17] realize you've been in the message many
[1:32:19] years in the ranks going to all the
[1:32:22] meetings you can get excited all you
[1:32:24] want to but the question is have you
[1:32:27] caught the vision of the Lord in
[1:32:31] humility that's right that's right yes
[1:32:35] sir because then you're not worried
[1:32:37] about being accepted in the message
[1:32:40] being seen that's right yes
[1:32:44] sir not worried about being seen you're
[1:32:46] not worried about a position wash
[1:32:47] positions wash away yeah sir yes sir so
[1:32:51] what does God have me to do doesn't have
[1:32:54] to be a position when it becomes all
[1:32:56] about positions the me who's the
[1:32:57] greatest preacher and who who's the
[1:32:59] convention speaker we're we're go
[1:33:00] becoming denominational that's right yes
[1:33:03] sir that's right God help us yes sir the
[1:33:07] third poll is to lead us out
[1:33:09] of out of the things that are a public
[1:33:12] show the vision is I seen a big tent but
[1:33:15] it didn't end in that big tent it ended
[1:33:18] in that little room I'll meet you in
[1:33:19] there that's right that's right it's not
[1:33:23] end to with a big bang around the
[1:33:25] country and a Big Revival around the
[1:33:26] country it's not supposed to end that
[1:33:28] way and brother I don't understand why
[1:33:30] you say I mean why is that that because
[1:33:32] he's so used to and all the preachers
[1:33:33] are used to all these healing campaigns
[1:33:35] and everything's so visible and God did
[1:33:38] it all God can be visible but I'm just
[1:33:41] letting you know this relationship in
[1:33:43] the third pole is not that visible it's
[1:33:46] between you and God yes sir yes sir he
[1:33:51] asked the angel he said I don't
[1:33:52] understand that and so every Vision has
[1:33:55] to line up with scripture and he took
[1:33:57] that he says did not our Lord say did
[1:34:00] not our Lord say that when you pray
[1:34:03] don't pray out here go into your closet
[1:34:07] and the father that sees and
[1:34:10] secret will reward you
[1:34:18] openly now you're talking the bride's
[1:34:22] Revival part of it part of it but don't
[1:34:26] eliminate it this will be no public
[1:34:29] show but it'll be ever bit as powerful
[1:34:32] it's sacred it's a sacred place yes sir
[1:34:35] that she brings and I've been hungering
[1:34:37] lately Lord take me there take me there
[1:34:42] Lord preached about it for years but
[1:34:45] Lord if I'm lacking anything take me
[1:34:47] into wherever I'm not here trying to
[1:34:50] interpret it tonight I'm not
[1:34:52] interpreting the brides Revival I think
[1:34:53] we should do that sir we shouldn't be
[1:34:55] seeking for what God's going to do we
[1:34:57] should be seeking the type of
[1:34:58] relationship with God that he can do
[1:35:01] whatever he wants to
[1:35:03] do and I'm saying Lord take me there
[1:35:06] take me deeper take me you know that new
[1:35:08] song take me deeper take me deeper
[1:35:12] Lord take me there Lord I'm not trying
[1:35:15] to interpret what it is I'm saying Lord
[1:35:17] take me there brother Braham
[1:35:21] says you see that King that had he had
[1:35:23] made an example before Isaiah and Isaiah
[1:35:25] seen that King as soon as he got out of
[1:35:27] his calling well God smoted him with
[1:35:30] Leprosy and then Isaiah thought what
[1:35:33] must I do Uzziah was dead he had leaned
[1:35:36] heavy on his
[1:35:38] arm Isaiah lean on the arm of
[1:35:41] Uzziah and he thought he was gone what
[1:35:44] would he do life itself was gone can you
[1:35:46] imagine now Isaiah is thinking life
[1:35:48] itself is gone I've lost my buddy I've
[1:35:50] lost my friend life is gone for him
[1:35:53] nearly so what did that young Prophet do
[1:35:56] he made his way down to the temple to
[1:35:58] pray he fell down at the altar he cried
[1:36:01] out if that's if you're going to cry
[1:36:03] over that not a pity party he cried out
[1:36:06] to God that's a good
[1:36:08] crying sometimes God lets the very props
[1:36:12] be knocked out from under
[1:36:14] us sometimes he lets sickness strike us
[1:36:17] he lets disappointments heartaches
[1:36:20] strike us sometimes he does that to get
[1:36:23] you where you'd be influenced by the
[1:36:25] gospel be wise enough to catch it I'm
[1:36:28] reading brother brandom here be wise
[1:36:31] enough to catch it don't be stupid
[1:36:33] enough to walk away from it notice
[1:36:37] Isaiah know that he must find something
[1:36:39] different so what did he do he went into
[1:36:40] the temple he raised up his hands he
[1:36:42] cried out to God he fell into a vision
[1:36:45] and as he fell into the vision he saw
[1:36:49] God Amen not a throne down here but
[1:36:53] lifted up up God Amen he saw the
[1:36:57] Lord and his testimony was that in that
[1:37:00] year it was a special year to me even
[1:37:04] though I lost my
[1:37:05] friend but that year is
[1:37:08] significant because when I lost this I
[1:37:11] saw the
[1:37:13] Lord I Saw the
[1:37:19] Lord
[1:37:22] hallelujah brother
[1:37:24] bradam couple places says about the
[1:37:27] young people uncertain sound 1960 I just
[1:37:30] wish I was a young fella again 18 20
[1:37:34] years old and know what I know and maybe
[1:37:37] I could stand up a little longer and
[1:37:40] visit a few more and or something like
[1:37:43] that for the kingdom of God's
[1:37:46] sake you listen in you young people this
[1:37:49] morning that's young and got a lot of
[1:37:52] Youth in you yet and not family ties and
[1:37:55] things may God let you see the vision of
[1:38:00] the hour that we're living
[1:38:03] in yes yes Lord you don't got a lot of
[1:38:07] responsibilities you don't got a lot of
[1:38:09] things you get married you get kids your
[1:38:12] time is cut in
[1:38:14] half with every kid it gets cut even
[1:38:17] more kids got time for yourself right
[1:38:20] now you got time to serve the Lord with
[1:38:21] all your heart didn't Paul say it 1
[1:38:23] Corinthians 7 he said though those that
[1:38:25] are unmarried careth for the things of
[1:38:27] the Lord more you have more time to do
[1:38:29] that he that's carth he that's married
[1:38:32] care for the things of his wife and
[1:38:33] responsibilities and and so you got a
[1:38:36] day season coming when you get married
[1:38:37] things will change a little bit but
[1:38:39] seize the opportunity that's right to
[1:38:41] catch the vision now right the
[1:38:44] responsibil come and you know the
[1:38:46] startling thing that comes on you when
[1:38:48] you when you realize that a bill comes
[1:38:50] in and it's got your name on it
[1:38:54] on
[1:38:56] what bad people they sent me a bill
[1:38:59] utility
[1:39:00] bill I say yeah son that's right Welcome
[1:39:04] to the Real
[1:39:08] World yeah and I so I go into their
[1:39:11] homes
[1:39:12] now and you you as kids get over you
[1:39:16] gotta you got to shut up and you got to
[1:39:18] quit saying things because they know
[1:39:21] everything like the kid I know I know it
[1:39:23] and then he got 27 28 H my dad may know
[1:39:26] a little
[1:39:27] bit and then they get 40 because when
[1:39:30] they were 5 years old my dad knows
[1:39:31] everything when they're 14 he doesn't
[1:39:33] know very much when they're 21 he
[1:39:35] doesn't know anything when they're 29
[1:39:37] they're saying he might know a little
[1:39:39] bit and when they're 40 my dad knows
[1:39:44] everything I don't mean to mock young
[1:39:46] people hey be you be yourself but you
[1:39:49] know I go through their houses and I
[1:39:50] just flip lights on I just FP all the
[1:39:52] lights on
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:39:57] secretly secretly but it's a little bit
[1:39:59] of
[1:40:01] payback it's things I can't say nothing
[1:40:04] to them you know because you try when
[1:40:07] they you know when I had two
[1:40:08] bodybuilders in my house two
[1:40:10] bodybuilders they were bodybuilders
[1:40:11] young dad I you I can pin I can bench I
[1:40:15] guess this I can bench 250 I well pick

[1:40:35] to get married and so you just do things
[1:40:37] behind the scenes you can't say anything
[1:40:38] to them but I took his fiance and I felt
[1:40:41] it important I felt this was a mission
[1:40:43] of mine to show his
[1:40:47] fiance to show his room to
[1:40:51] her I know I know
[1:40:53] but it's it's things that we have to do
[1:40:57] to pay back a little
[1:40:59] bit and and seriously I mean it's I felt
[1:41:03] that she should know this this is
[1:41:06] reality this is the guy you're going to
[1:41:08] marry I know you're in love and you're
[1:41:11] Twitter ped oh this guy's the best thing
[1:41:13] but can you just come with me for a
[1:41:15] minute and look at this
[1:41:21] room it's a lot of fun
[1:41:25] raising kids teenagers I I don't regret
[1:41:28] any of it it's a lot of fun it really
[1:41:31] is but going back to what brother Bram
[1:41:34] says you get busy in life things you
[1:41:37] don't have an opportunity like you have
[1:41:41] now I'm 10 I'm eight I'm I'm 13 doesn't
[1:41:44] matter you've got an opportunity to
[1:41:46] really serve the
[1:41:48] Lord really being linked up with the
[1:41:50] Lord real close and many of you are
[1:41:53] doing doing that and I can see that
[1:41:55] saying what how can I be used in in the
[1:41:57] you know that's wonderful praise God but
[1:42:00] say Lord let me catch the vision right
[1:42:04] yes and then he goes to 65 when he's
[1:42:06] speaking to the the young people the
[1:42:08] graduates come follow me and he says
[1:42:10] Lord Jesus youth men and women for
[1:42:13] tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must
[1:42:16] train them Lord we feel the burden if
[1:42:19] anybody wants to know this is a quote
[1:42:22] that brother Barry and I have have used
[1:42:23] for 30 some years now as the basis for
[1:42:26] our retreat in training young people not
[1:42:29] only should they have the preaching of
[1:42:30] the Holy Ghost to get an experience but
[1:42:32] brother Bram says we must train
[1:42:35] them we must train them as well we must
[1:42:38] teach them the principles of God don't
[1:42:41] bash teaching it's part of the
[1:42:44] word
[1:42:47] Sir W praise the
[1:42:49] lord we must train them this is what we
[1:42:52] use to quote as our basis we must train
[1:42:54] them like there will that he said we
[1:42:57] must train them like there will be a
[1:42:59] tomorrow if there's not a tomorrow then
[1:43:01] today is the day we feel that burden to
[1:43:04] train them like there will be a tomorrow
[1:43:07] so we pray heavenly father that they'll
[1:43:10] catch the vision
[1:43:12] now and see and hear that great Eternal
[1:43:16] invitation come and follow me May each
[1:43:18] of them Lord turn aside from the things
[1:43:21] of the world and this more mortal fringy
[1:43:25] life may young men and women even
[1:43:27] tonight may they catch the vision for
[1:43:30] this
[1:43:31] hour may God remove other things out of
[1:43:33] your life so you can see the
[1:43:37] Lord I might say this to end on tonight
[1:43:40] because it's it's relevant to catching
[1:43:43] the vision and you know when he says a
[1:43:45] vision we know prophets when you look up
[1:43:48] Vision in in Websters it talks about a
[1:43:50] trance that someone can go into and
[1:43:52] that's a prophet the Lord takes him into
[1:43:55] Vision to see things he's specially
[1:43:56] built for that but the other part of the
[1:43:59] meaning says to catch a revelation or to
[1:44:01] catch a revealing so we may not be a
[1:44:04] prophet to see it like he sees it but
[1:44:06] the same vision he catches and speaks we
[1:44:09] catch it by
[1:44:10] Revelation sir okay so we can all catch
[1:44:13] the vision and what supernaturally
[1:44:15] revealed Paul told Timothy Paul was the
[1:44:18] prophet and then Timothy underneath him
[1:44:19] he caught the same vision as Paul I have
[1:44:22] no man like minded he caught the vision
[1:44:24] so he didn't have to be a prophet say
[1:44:26] Lord show me a vision like brother
[1:44:28] brandom you may not be a built for don't
[1:44:29] ask for that if you're not built for it
[1:44:31] but you can catch the vision that was
[1:44:33] sent through the prophet to live it
[1:44:36] out right I mean this respectfully
[1:44:39] what's more powerful the one who catches
[1:44:42] it and sees it and speaks it or the ones
[1:44:44] who live out the
[1:44:46] vision that's sir you're the ones called
[1:44:50] to live it out you're the ones to live
[1:44:53] about the drama for this hour you see
[1:44:55] the enemy you see everybody in the drama
[1:44:56] but I'm not the enemy I'm on the good
[1:44:58] side in the in the picture for this hour
[1:45:01] and I'm living and what's more powerful
[1:45:03] than even a prophetic Vision didn't
[1:45:05] Jesus say that John was the least in the
[1:45:08] Kingdom of John he said but he that's
[1:45:10] least is better than he Abol TR amen not
[1:45:14] belittling the prophet I'm just saying
[1:45:16] we lift up that gift so much but you
[1:45:21] don't realize the vision that he brought
[1:45:23] is to be lived out in a bride lived out
[1:45:26] in the new generation I was just
[1:45:28] preaching this morning about Israel
[1:45:30] being caught there on the mountain for
[1:45:31] 38 years they went surrounded a mountain
[1:45:34] all kinds of immaturities and Fighters
[1:45:36] and all the and God finally said it's I
[1:45:39] it's time to stop surrounding this
[1:45:41] mountain it's time to turn northward but
[1:45:43] he had already said before because some
[1:45:45] of you are Fighters because some of you
[1:45:47] have disobeyed and went up and down I
[1:45:49] won't even let that generation go in and
[1:45:52] brother says when the old Fighters die
[1:45:54] off I'll take the new
[1:45:57] generation and I'll take them northward
[1:46:00] and they'll really come into what this
[1:46:01] message is the promise of this message
[1:46:05] sir but I wanted to say something before
[1:46:08] I close
[1:46:09] about
[1:46:10] um
[1:46:15] television the the
[1:46:17] achievement naturally for every age will
[1:46:20] have a type to where the Lord's taken
[1:46:21] the bride how many knows
[1:46:24] that and so we find then that what is
[1:46:28] science has achieved in the 20th century
[1:46:31] when they developed the
[1:46:33] television it and in this that Century
[1:46:36] the natural achievements of Sci AR
[1:46:38] science are a type of what's going on
[1:46:40] spiritually in the bride so you I know
[1:46:41] you know that but did you notice as time
[1:46:43] goes on they keep coming out with
[1:46:45] screens on TVs that become more and more
[1:46:48] clear all the
[1:46:50] time what makes up the picture on a
[1:46:53] television screen is small dots called
[1:46:56] pixels and on a traditional analog TV
[1:46:59] screen there's an effective pixel
[1:47:01] resolution of 210,000 pixels that's an
[1:47:05] analog one of the first televisions to
[1:47:07] bring out the new digital screens have
[1:47:09] advanced so much they contained about
[1:47:12] two million now that was 10 years ago
[1:47:14] two million pixels so so what what's
[1:47:17] happening now in science is they keep
[1:47:19] developing developing to put more pixels
[1:47:22] in there and the more pictures you have
[1:47:25] the clearer the vision
[1:47:27] is somebody shout praise the
[1:47:30] Lord this generation this vision's got
[1:47:33] to be crystal clear to
[1:47:37] them and I looked it up last night the
[1:47:40] new 4ks and I'm not preach promoting TVs
[1:47:43] here of
[1:47:45] course but the new
[1:47:47] 4ks have gone now and they have 8
[1:47:50] million pixels in them wow and you go
[1:47:53] through those stores you see it wow is
[1:47:55] that ever Crystal Clear praise the
[1:48:00] Lord what happens in science is
[1:48:04] happening through the
[1:48:06] message in the early days maybe this
[1:48:09] message and what it was it wasn't so
[1:48:11] Crystal Clear but I can tell you it's
[1:48:13] coming clearer and clearer and clearer
[1:48:16] and
[1:48:17] clearer because God by Revelation just
[1:48:20] keeps putting more pixels in there and
[1:48:22] when I go to the message now I don't
[1:48:24] read it like I did 20 years ago I'll
[1:48:26] tell you I'm seeing it a lot more clear
[1:48:29] the Lord's becoming more real to
[1:48:32] me it's becoming Crystal Clear what his
[1:48:35] desire
[1:48:38] is hallelujah that's my heart
[1:48:42] tonight that's what the message and
[1:48:44] God's grace is making it more clear and
[1:48:47] more clear how many of that's been in
[1:48:49] the faith a little while can say it's
[1:48:50] becoming more clear
[1:48:53] yes that's a television that's a
[1:48:55] television science what they come out
[1:48:57] with but you see there's a much greater
[1:49:00] television Prophet C where there is no
[1:49:04] vision the people perish that's right
[1:49:06] when God sends a prophet he sends a
[1:49:08] vision to the people right and when they
[1:49:11] send that Vision write the vision make
[1:49:15] it
[1:49:17] plain clear write the V
[1:49:20] habac write the vision
[1:49:23] make it
[1:49:24] plain give it millions of
[1:49:28] pixels so what so the people can run

[1:49:34] this message I pray God will raise up an
[1:49:37] army friends in these young people and
[1:49:40] fill them so full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:49:42] this word becomes so pickle perfectly
[1:49:46] clear that there arises a stir on them
[1:49:48] to run with this
[1:49:51] message the young men shall faint the
[1:49:55] young men in Isaiah will fall but he
[1:49:57] says he that Waits on the Lord God shall
[1:50:00] renew the youth he'll renew their
[1:50:02] strength and they shall Mount up with

[2:18:14] you Hallelujah blessed be the name of
[2:18:17] the
[2:18:18] Lord thank you Lord Jesus
[2:18:22] amen I certainly believe that the Lord
[2:18:26] has really spoke to our hearts
[2:18:29] tonight you
[2:18:32] know I just love how the word the
[2:18:35] message of the
[2:18:37] hour it come to do away with all the
[2:18:42] veils that's why that it it we're not
[2:18:45] looking and seeing the Lord
[2:18:48] Jesus Through The Eyes or the lens of
[2:18:51] someone
[2:18:54] else when God sends a prophet it's the
[2:18:57] eyes and God has provided for
[2:19:00] himself so we're not looking
[2:19:03] at brother branham's
[2:19:05] ideas brother bram's thoughts it's not
[2:19:08] brother bram's opinions it's thus sayith
[2:19:11] the Lord that's right and so we're
[2:19:13] seeing Christ for who he really is and
[2:19:17] as we look at him we find out who we
[2:19:20] really really are that's right and then
[2:19:22] when we can catch that as the Lord was
[2:19:24] saying tonight on catching that
[2:19:27] Vision you know there's one thing about
[2:19:29] it that if you have to take your eyes
[2:19:31] off of Christ to find anything in life a
[2:19:34] mate a job or anything it's not the
[2:19:37] right thing for you that's right but
[2:19:39] everything that God has for you right it
[2:19:41] should be where you have to continue and
[2:19:43] you're looking so deep in that Vision
[2:19:46] till you see his will because every part
[2:19:50] of God's will what he has in that Vision
[2:19:53] will never take away of what he has for
[2:19:56] you and himself in your life yes it will
[2:19:59] only be a complimenting and an adding to
[2:20:02] it yes that's why in Real Marriage it
[2:20:05] doesn't take
[2:20:06] away it brings everything and all these
[2:20:09] other attributes everything begins to
[2:20:11] work in such a proper Channel with a
[2:20:14] vision of the lord it's not a
[2:20:16] struggle it brings us into a real rest
[2:20:21] and I tell you with everything the God's
[2:20:23] will just God wants to make his will so
[2:20:26] clear to you and I and I thought there's
[2:20:30] a lot of points that was so good I I
[2:20:32] love the teaching I love where it gets
[2:20:35] down to where that these are things that
[2:20:37] you can take and apply right in your
[2:20:41] life you know I I I love I love all that
[2:20:44] God has for us I love the great bouquet
[2:20:46] I love the the great EV Evangelistic
[2:20:48] Services all that has its part there's
[2:20:50] all all those parts to play but I love
[2:20:52] the teaching when it gets down because
[2:20:54] after it's all said and done and you
[2:20:56] come out of a meeting you come out of a
[2:20:58] camp you've got to know how to apply the
[2:21:00] word you've received and you've got to
[2:21:02] know how to live it and God directs Us
[2:21:05] in such a way when we've met the person
[2:21:07] of Jesus Christ my
[2:21:10] I I so enjoyed it tonight because like
[2:21:13] the prophet said he said Paul never met
[2:21:15] a book he met the person of Jesus Christ
[2:21:20] and when you met him then he becomes the
[2:21:23] absolute and the word becomes the
[2:21:25] absolute in our life and then we see the
[2:21:27] message as the absolute because it's not
[2:21:29] one taken away from the other it's all
[2:21:31] Christ being unfolded ain't that
[2:21:35] beautiful then it's not it's not about
[2:21:37] dos and don'ts it's actually seeing him
[2:21:39] for who he really is and seeing yourself
[2:21:42] for who you really are I tell you
[2:21:45] there's nobody who can tell you and I
[2:21:46] who we really are like God
[2:21:49] can
[2:21:51] the world the world cannot the world
[2:21:53] wants to pull this way and pull that way
[2:21:55] but I'm so thankful for a Clear Vision
[2:21:57] in this hour I I'm so thankful for that
[2:22:00] as you heard brother Paul go through
[2:22:01] that even when he was speaking them
[2:22:03] latter parts of the mission trips
[2:22:05] there's a lot of test there's a lot of
[2:22:07] Trials there's a lot of things that come
[2:22:09] our way and let me just tell you things
[2:22:11] are going to come your way whether you
[2:22:13] serve God or
[2:22:14] not there's people that have hardships
[2:22:16] that don't serve
[2:22:18] God but I'll tell you what when you're
[2:22:20] serving serving the lord and you've got
[2:22:21] him first I tell you God will bring you
[2:22:24] out on top every single
[2:22:26] time when you put God first God will
[2:22:29] bring you through and every test every
[2:22:31] trial all that he brings you through
[2:22:33] he's molding and making more out of your
[2:22:36] life he's bringing forth more of him and
[2:22:40] less of
[2:22:41] us my every step of the way God gives us
[2:22:44] the courage gives us the strength this
[2:22:47] is why I believe this message it comes
[2:22:49] to bring stability in our life it brings
[2:22:52] stability to where that even when you
[2:22:54] don't feel God's presence you've got to
[2:22:56] have a stability on the inside that you
[2:22:58] know that you know that you know because
[2:23:01] there's times you don't feel his
[2:23:04] presence is that right it's a lot of
[2:23:07] times it's been said it's very easy to
[2:23:08] live Victorious inside of Youth Camp but
[2:23:12] it's when you come out of that that's it
[2:23:14] it's it's it's when you come out of it
[2:23:17] that you've got to have that vision of
[2:23:19] him and that's what stabiliz
[2:23:22] and that that's the whole goal of this
[2:23:26] messag you might say well how is that
[2:23:28] different from every other church
[2:23:30] because every other Church wants you to
[2:23:32] catch the vision of some man somewhere
[2:23:36] else of what his slant and angle is on
[2:23:38] the word of God but the God sent a
[2:23:41] message to remove all the veils so
[2:23:44] you're not running to somebody else and
[2:23:46] say hey what did what what did Brother
[2:23:48] Bram say right here what did Brother
[2:23:49] Bram mean right here what what did so so
[2:23:50] me God removes all veils you've got
[2:23:53] direct access am to God right I love
[2:23:58] that I love that he's a personal God you
[2:24:02] know what he's never failed me I failed
[2:24:04] him a lot i' I've failed him a lot but
[2:24:07] he's never failed me amen God is so good
[2:24:10] and it's all the principle of yielding
[2:24:14] and just as the Lord spoke to each of
[2:24:15] your hearts and I tell you I believe God
[2:24:17] spoke to everybody's heart here tonight
[2:24:19] I know he did mind we want to go deeper
[2:24:22] Lord I want that Vision to become more
[2:24:24] clear a vision and see myself in that
[2:24:28] vision and catching that Vision in this
[2:24:30] hour amen don't you love him how me
[2:24:33] appreciate brother
[2:24:34] Paul
[2:24:36] [Music]
[2:24:36] [Applause]
[2:24:41] amen
[2:24:43] amen you know Brother Paul's he's just a
[2:24:46] wonderful singer and I and I enjoy his
[2:24:48] singing But if I had to choose between
[2:24:49] his singing and his preaching I enjoy
[2:24:51] his
[2:24:52] preaching I like his singing but that
[2:24:55] that's me I I just I enjoy when I enjoy
[2:24:58] when things get down to the Practical
[2:25:00] nuts and bolts I love I love that I love
[2:25:03] when it gets down there amen amen don't
[2:25:06] you love the Lord amen amen so good to
