it's good to be here with you tonight let's just stand let's go to the Lord in prayer before we turn to the scripture tonight or not father for my benefit Lord but for that the people may benefit from your word your lord I pray dear God that you will direct me now Lord through this sermon that you've laid on my heart your God that I would be able to yield to you that you may speak to the people and be a help encouragement to them we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ into the glory of God amen turn with me in your Bibles if you would to Genesis chapter 16 I want to read verses 1 through 5 what I'd like to title this tonight is I make so many mistakes just as 16 verse one now sarah abraham's wife bear him no children and she had a handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarah said unto Abram behold now the LORD hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah Sarah Abraham's Abraham's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after Abe Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife and he went in unto Hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes and Sarah I said unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee I have given my maid in thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised in her eyes the Lord judge between me and thee may be seated we consider Abraham to be the father of faith and that's what the Scriptures tells us that he is and the Scriptures refers to us as Abraham's children but as we look at Abraham's life I believe Abraham could stand and say I make so many mistakes here God had told him he was going to have a son and Sara begin to doubt how it could be by her and it caused Abraham to doubt and Sarah come up with this ideal this great human carnal ideal and said I know how we can get this done you go in into my handmaid she'll have a child and that'll be my child and this is the way we're going to bring to past God's promise first of all God doesn't need your help to bring about his promises he doesn't need my help to keep his promises God doesn't need my help to protect his word God doesn't need any man's help to protect his word his word will remain true there is always going to be a people that are in the middle of the road there may be those that are on the left-hand and those are on the right may be some that put too much but more focus on brother Branham than they do Jesus Christ then there's others on the other side that there's they're saying well there's nothing to it and they're leaving the message but there's always going to be a people that stays right there in the middle of the road believing the truth now as we find as time went on that God comes and tells Abraham that he's going to give a son to him by Sarah and he changes her name from Sarah into Sarah and he Abraham laughs in his heart same very thing that Sarah was guilty of a little while later Abraham laughed and said me and old man and Sarah as old as she is we're gonna have a child and then he says we had an ideal God and what we did was I had a child another child I had a child by Sarah's handmaiden he said all that Ishmael might live before thee but God wouldn't accept in that because that wasn't in line with his plan that wasn't in line with his promise it would be a substitution and God doesn't need any substitutions and so God doesn't know you and Sarah are gonna have a son then we find out sometime later that Sarah does conceive and she has a son but then Ishmael who's about 13 14 years old begins to mock the child and so Sarah says you know that idea we had Abraham scratch that you need to kick that bondwoman and her son out because her son's not going to be heir with my son now Abraham and Sarah's mistake has cost the world ever since the in the Bible the angel told Hagar that he was going to be a wild man he would never settle down and he would be against every man and every man would be against him and it's still that way today Abraham and Sarah before Isaac was born they went on it was on a journey and they came through this kingdom where Abimelech was king and Abraham had told Sarah when they first started out traveling when they left the land of the Chaldeans he said look you're my half-sister you're the sister of my father you're my father's daughter but not my mother's so you're my half-sister so anytime we come someplace and they asked who you are just telling me or my sister now Abraham did this out of his flesh he did it out of fear he did it because he was a human and had fear and as time went on they came through this Kingdom and the King looked on Sarah and saw that she was fair and he wanted her for wife Negra ham being fearful was gonna let him take her they took Sarah was getting her all prepared up to marry and then the Lord appeared to BEM elec in a dream and he said don't do it you've got a man's wife and Abimelech said did not he tell me that was his sister and did not she say that was her brother if I've done anything I've done it out of ignorance and he didn't want God to hold it against him God said don't touch her then and said not only that but restore to her husband and said I'm going to cause every woman in your land to be barren and I'm going to cause you to be sick and unless you get him to pray for you that he's my prophet and unless you get him to pray for you you're not going to get any better and that's something Abraham made so many mistakes here he was guilty of lying he's been guilty of doubting he was guilty of unbelief he was guilty at laughing at God and yet Abraham didn't do any of these things to be a bad person but it was God in His grace that Abraham through all his mistakes God was still with it and God still heard his prayer when he prayed for the King Abimelech and when God heard his prayer then he opened the wounds of the women and He healed Abimelech and told him been Electress toward the man his wife and send him on their way you'd think that the son could have learned from the father's mistake later on Isaac was guilty of the same thing I think about this when it was laid on my heart and I to be honest with you I come up with this title because I feel like I make so many mistakes and I seen in the scripture where Abraham made one mistake after another and but when Romans when Paul wrote roamed the book of Romans and I want to go to chapter 4 verse 16 through 20 Paul didn't mention any of these things romans 4 verse 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made the father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which are not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and be not weak in the faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in the faith giving glory to God this is what God thought of Abraham I'll quote three more scriptures for you Galatians three and six it says even as abraham believed god it was accounted to him for righteousness Galatians three and nine said so then they which be of the faith are blessed with faithful Abraham so in God's eyes Abraham was faithful Hebrews 2 and 16 said I don't really like this one we're barely talking about Christ for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham this is what God thought of Abraham now [Music] we'll get back to Abraham in a moment but many of you've heard of the interview with sister Bruce and how brother Branham went to pray for her she was having heart trouble and she was thinking she was going to die and brother Brandon went to pray for her and when he got there why he told her you know God hadn't showed me anything I believe you're gonna live and she says what I want most more than healing she said what I want most is an experience that I have been sealed by the Holy Ghost friends on tell you that's what anyone should want most is to know they've been sealed by the Holy Ghost we're not going to make it without it you're gonna have to have the Holy Ghost that's the Bible there was ten virgins and the only the ones that had the Holy Ghost went with the bridegroom while the other ones went to get it the bridegroom came and was gone by the time they got back so you're gonna have to have it you won't make the rapture without it you won't make the bride without Thor be having the Holy Ghost should most of all I want the experience I've been sealed by the Holy Ghost the rims I believe in your heart you are real born-again Christian and he says but you see you're a nervous type of person and he says and when you let little bitty things mount up and he says and it goes both ways with you he says when someone comes on your heart to pray for him why you can't rest until you've prayed for him it'll just keep building till you get there and pray for him he says and God works he said but then Satan works and he tries to get you believed to believe that you don't have it and then he says you let this and that begin to build up on it in your mind and he said but don't look at yourself now we've thought so much that we should be looking at ourselves we thought so much that we should look in the mirror take inventory take count and see if I got everything all right and then that's correct but you can't look at your flesh you can't look at this outward man when we're looking in the mirror we're looking in a spiritual mirror at the spiritual man we're not looking in a natural mirror at this natural man and we're not looking at a spiritual mirror at this natural man because this outside flesh is never going to get the Holy Ghost it stinks and as long as you're in this flesh you're always going to be contending with it because in your flesh you your spirit realm connects with your flesh and in your spirit you got memory and if you ever was a drinker why in your memory can connect with your flesh and you can remember what it tastes like whatever you had done you you that's in your memory the pleasures of this world that you may have taken place the part in you don't forget what they felt like and Satan works in that realm and you've got to contend with this flesh because of those things and in this flesh you're never going to feel righteous you know there are some people that they maybe go a stretch where they feel like I haven't done anything wrong maybe it's been thirty days and I haven't done one thing wrong boy I'm feeling pretty good right now that's somebody depending in their own righteousness there are people in this world that are good moral upstanding individuals but they don't have God in their life so just being good moral and upstanding isn't enough you've got to have Christ now the mystery of it all is that on the inside of this stinking rotten flesh is the real you and that's where God abides he's hid himself in flesh that's why others can look at you especially those of the world they look at you and I'll tell you what if you make a mistake in front of them they're sure lets you know about it I thought you were supposed to be a Christian but they're looking at your flesh but God sees the desire of your heart and I'm going to tell you something about the desire of your heart the desire of your heart will bring this stinking rotten flesh into subjection the desire of your heart when you realize you've made a mistake will want to get right right away kids it ain't something that you say well I'll tell you what Lord I'm going to bed tonight I'll take care of that in the morning no if the desire of your heart is to serve God then you're going to take care of it right as soon as it comes to your realization that you've done something you can't rest you got to know that you're pleasing to them you got to know that he's forgiving brother branham said if Jesus crying sister Bruce said if Jesus Christ was here he would lay his hands on you and you would be miraculously healed he said now I'm not Jesus I'm just a sinner he says but in God's eyes I'm not a sinner and neither are you she says I make so many mistakes he said we've got a blood sacrifice and he said that blood was shed for us and it covers our sins and he said and your mistakes that's what he died for so that your mistakes wouldn't be seen Oh hallelujah why because your mistakes can't come up before God because they first gotta pass through the blood of Jesus Christ and so the blood of Christ acts as a bumper and the sin never comes up before God the mistakes never show up before God that's why God could say through his prophet Paul that Abraham never doubted that's what God could say through Paul that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in the faith giving glory to God why because God never saw any of Abraham's mistakes she said but I've still never had an experience that I can put my foot on and you know we all want something we all want something to give us reassurance and there's many people that they look to things but things something they felt on their flesh and I heard somebody say one time and god bless her brother I'm sure he's got the Holy Ghost I don't say for that but he said to me he said when I got the Holy Ghost it was like something warm pour down over my body and I don't doubt that but that's not the evidence that's not how I can say I believe that brother's got the Holy Ghost I believe that brother's got the Holy Ghost because I watched his life this is a minister that many of you would know I just don't say his name cuz I don't see anything but I believe to know that he has the Holy Ghost but not because something warm core down over but I've seen the evidence in his life over the years that I've known him and I've known him many years or the brand says ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped and iniquity coming to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being he said that was your nature he told sister Bruce but it changed once but what changed it she said Christ and he said they're your sisters see that's it you know an individual can come through justification and sanctification and if they stop right there they're just in dangerous territory because sanctification means that the vessels been cleaned out and it's ready to be filled and the Bible says that when the spirits gone out of the man it walketh in dry places and searches for a home and it says when it can't find a place to rest it says I'll returning into my house and when it does it takes seven other spirits with it that's why it's so dangerous for an individual just to to move to a place to be sanctified and then not the one to have an experience with God and be filled with the Holy Ghost say what are they going to do to get filled with the Holy Ghost believe it it's a free gift it's not something you've got to earn it's not something where you've got to say well when I get righteous enough God's gonna fill me with the Holy Ghost go see then you're still looking at your flesh you know brother Branham says the problem is people come to sanctification he says and all they do is they just stop doing things because they know they shouldn't do them but that's not enough they've got to be filled with the Holy Ghost and when they are then the desire changes then what the worshiper once purged has no more desire of sin [Applause] and he says he quotes from the scripture he says he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come into the judgment but hath past tense passed from death unto life he said that's it you have eternal life we as humans have a tendency we would like to have something that we could point you well this or that happened to me or I had this or that feeling her you know and I'll tell you what when the Spirit comes on you flows over and you get these foods they're great they're wonderful I love that you can feel it surging through here that's not the evidence because that rain falls on the just and the unjust but there was something that comes into your life that doesn't only clean you up and get you ready to be filled but something comes in and changes you from the individual that you were to someone else and that old man who used to be you you look at and say that was never me and you look back and you can't understand why did I live the way I lived why did I do the things I did because you were serving a master but something changed then you don't do the things you used to do only and it's not this distance you don't do them you don't have no desire to do brother branham goes on to pray for sister bruce pardon me and while he's praying he says all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord your Bible says that and he said so there must be something that God is working out in her life that we don't know about but what she was going through he said is gonna work out for her good my brother random has this interview before he goes out and preaches the message masterpiece and when he comes out to minister this message breaches message on masterpiece he refers to the interview he just doesn't say who it was with but he says this he said only interview a few moments ago I was speaking to a person in the room and that that's present now and said but brother branham I have so many things I know that's wrong a godly little woman and I said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is what you tried to do and if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of Jesus Christ he made away see God made a covenant with man in the beginning but man couldn't keep his part he couldn't keep up his in so when God made a covenant with Abraham the only thing he required out of Abraham was a seal a sign that he had accepted the covenant between him and God and that was a sign of circumcision that was the only thing God required out of Abraham see God made an unconditional covenant and he's got an unconditional covenant with you forgive me if this offends in you one this example I'm gonna give but I read a sign one time that said a dog loves unconditionally a dog can get a love for an individual and no matter how that individual treats them the dog still loves them that's something that's unconditional it doesn't it doesn't matter how the person is it still comes and with God it doesn't matter how your flesh is the covenants not based on your flesh the Covenant is not based on you the Covenant is based on God so no matter what mistakes you make it never touches the Covenant [Music] [Applause] what God saved someone knowing he was going to lose them would God save someone not knowing how it was gonna come out and say well I'll tell you what I'm gonna give this individual a try and I'll give him a I'll give him a chance and we'll just see how it goes that's not God God knows everything he knows the beginning from the end there is nothing hid or secret to God God knew everything about your life what you would do what you wouldn't do he knew all the good you would do he knew the faith that you would have and he knew all the mistakes you would make before you were ever even born and he still loved you who was Abraham that God should call him Abraham was nobody he was an idol worshiper brother branham said they got their idol worship from Nimrod who started I he was the first one to start idol worship and he said it come on down through and then here's Abraham and his people and they were idol worshipers he said his people come from the Tower of Babel who was Abraham he was nothing there was nothing special about Abraham the man but God chose him and that's what made Abraham special because God chose him now we know that God knows what you would do what you wouldn't do he knows what you would choose and what you wouldn't choose he knows everybody but that's not why God called you that's not why he chose you he chose you because you're part of him he chose you but look I don't have it right before me right now but in the Bible I could take you through the names of the descendants in Genesis and each one of those names has a meaning behind it and we know that brother Branham said Cain married one of his sisters and then you could go through Kings lineage and look at the meanings of the names of his descendants and eventually you'll find one whose name means who is of God the question who is of God because they got so crossed up now that man had no idea who was seated garden who was it and we still don't know and he got so messed up Satan didn't know and he still don't know but God knows and that's how God chose you because he knows you're part of him he made you who you are he made you to have the temperament and personality that you had and I'm gonna tell you something the body change doesn't change that you'll still be the same person the essence of the same person just in a glorified body with a theophany and all the things that you deal with in this spirit within your spirit realm you won't be dealing with that no more that's how Satan is going to be bound you know what gets to a Tormentor someone who likes to agitate and torment people you know what gets to him when they aren't having no effect Satan is a tormentor but there's coming a day when he isn't gonna had no more effect on you then who is going to be in torment but right now he can torment you in your mind brother Branham said that's the batter brownie chose was the battleground of the mind and he fights you there in your mind and that's what he was telling sister Bruce he said he puts these Saints in your mind and then you get to thinking on him and it builds up you see this did you done wrong you see that did you done wrong you see dissing your oh and he gets build up and build up and build up to you then begin to doubt whether he'll even got it [Applause] Satan's good at his job he's been doing it a long time he's perfected [Music] god knows what he's doing he doesn't just give people a try and see what they'll do he knows what he's doing he knows who he's choosen where the Brenham says in the message of oneness he said we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have him stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with that a real true servant if he stumbles he'll get up again and if he wobbles god of pulling right back on the path as long as he's in the path of duty now he says this in the message of go tell 1960 and because the message is right because God sent the message because God sent the messenger no doubt every gun in Hell will be firing at him and he'll stumble and fall and was he talking about that messenger the seventh angel messenger he said he'll stumble and fall we can look in brother Browns life and can we see that he made mistakes yes but he stumble and fall at times yes brother branham tried to take his old life but God prevented it he was a man he was human but God even through all his mistakes he was still God's prophet he preached some things in the earlier part of his ministry that he changed after the seals were over well no wonder he said the Bible become a new Bible to him when the seals were open you'll stumble and fall and get up and shake his head and go on we got a message there's nothing gonna stop it we can apply that to ourselves we've got a message and there's nothing going to stop it all the Devils in hell can't stop it you say what's my part your part is to live this message to live this word not to just know the message not did you say you believed the message but to be the message your what it's all about you're the reason he died you're the reason we had a have a redeemer you're the reason the book had to be took out of the hand of him that sat on the throne because God wanted you sane he wanted you to have a way back to the Tree of Life redemption story is all about you hallelujah [Applause] Abraham left the land sojourned called himself a stranger in the pilgrim and look Abraham as all mortals was not an immortal man not a man that can't make mistake but constantly made mistakes but no matter how many mistakes he made his anger still held and brother Bentham says our faith within us is anchored and though many times were walking through dark shadows and many times we're stumbling along the road but our anchor still holds like that song says the ship is battered the sails are torn but the anchor holds I can identify with that song sometimes I feel battered I feel like my sails are torn I feel like that the wind has gone out of me sort of speed but I've got something that'll holds me there's something within me that keeps me going when my flesh wants to stop when my flesh wants to give up there's something in me that won't quit what is that you've got the Holy Ghost [Applause] it just won't quit it won't stop you've got the inner teachers you've got a desire that has woken up within your heart that won't let you quit no matter how hard it gets no matter how tough it gets no matter how impossible it looks hallelujah hallelujah you know Abraham when he left he took his daddy with him and he took his nephew with him and brother Brown said as long as Abraham had them along God could never bless him and he says finally God took the old man Abraham's daddy died he said God took him why cuz Abraham wouldn't leave him even though he was instructed to - to separate himself but he wouldn't so God just took him off the seat and then there come a time when brother Bram said lot maxilla and he and Abraham separated ways then God could bless Abraham the Branham says look at Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the mistakes they've made look the mistakes that Moses me we many times have said and went back to his ministers were in the book of Joshua God spoke to joseline says as I was with Moses so shall I be with you and we pointed at how Moses made so many mistakes but God was with him and he was given Joshua the insurance look I'm not with you because you're so good in the flesh I'm with you as I'll be with Moses because I chose Moses was never outside of God's plan no if God didn't mean for the Egyptian to get killed by Moses but Moses still was never out of God's plan God's plan was he was going to be the deliverer you see what I'm saying and so he never couldn't get away from that he was always he remained in God's plan of how he was going to bring this about the Bentham says look at all the mistakes they made but God was with them he said it was a shadow one of how God would be with you through all of your mistakes and why because he called you who were you that God should call you who was I that God should call me I wasn't anybody who was my dad that God should open the truth of this hour up to him and bring him out of the denomination he wasn't anybody special but we look on him as a special man it's because the God that was in the man is because of the God he yielded himself to God told Abraham I'm going to bring you to me when you're old brother what I'm sitting in other words he said I'm gonna say to you I'm gonna bring you through you're gonna live a long life and you're going to be the father of Nations hallelujah the father of Nations now through natural seed we can see where Israel is God's nation Israel is a nation that come from Abraham but it's spiritual Abraham is the father of many nations in many nations he has children spiritual children of Abraham brother branham says before Abraham done one thing to merit anything God called it God called you God elected you he's not gonna lose you I Got News for You God's never gonna give up on you God's not gonna say well I'll tell you what that was the last straw they just went too far that time know why cuz God called you you're his elect God will stop you before you even go to father because you're his elect salvation is a free gift you didn't earn it you didn't buy it it's a free gift the Holy Ghost is a free gift no man can give it to you however the path of life does lie through man brother Branham says in one place he said boss teachers will bring false birth so I fail to see how individuals could sit under a pastor who doesn't have the Holy Ghost and be able to get the whole ego because they got nothing to lead them to it because you receive the Holy Ghost by hearing the word that's how it comes to the Gentile Joe bji brother Branham says you say but brother branham I made a mistake last week or last month I don't care how many mistakes you make we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God if you're a child of Abraham you're and you're ready to recognize that as sin and come back to God again God's mercy still hangs to you brother Adam said God would have done away with Sarah when she doubted but he couldn't because of Abraham he said Sarah was part of Abraham so God couldn't touch Sarah without touching Abraham and he says the same thing with you and I were part of Christ God can't touch you without first touching his son because you and the son are one you've been joined in Union he says he can't kill the elect he can't take your life because you're part of himself you're the word the band said that's where grace comes in he couldn't take Sara without touching Abraham he said that was where grace comes in because he can't touch you without touching his son it doesn't matter how many mistakes the church makes it's still his church God correct and I think God for that I think God that he doesn't just let us go that he will correct my brother random gives the example he says like a little boy or a little girl or a little child that's learning to walk he said let's learn to walk it's gonna fall he said if he's got a good if they got a good daddy he won't spank him because they fell but he'll just stand him back up and saying walk this way he said that's the way God is with us he just picks us back up brushes us off he says now walk this way side now talk this way now think this way the Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgressions you know what a Knick watir Nick woody is doing something you know is wrong and do it anyway but God still forgives you that's his word you say how does how does that work in you make mistake it's like this give you an example you know it isn't right to lose your temper and and just go off but yet you've done it it's happening would God forgive you the RAM says and as long as you're wanting and hungry to give back to God there's a god somewhere calling to you or you wouldn't be hungry backslidings not lost I want someone to tell me where backslidings lost and prove it to the Bible backsliders not lost he's just out of fellowship Israel back slid but they never lost their covenant they lost their praises and joy David lost the joy of his salvation when he took Bathsheba your eyes wife but he never lost his salvation he never said restoring to me my salvation he said restoring to me the joy of my salvation there was a young lady named Betty doddery there was an brother branham's meeting and she was in brother Browns meetings when she was really young teenager and she came up before brother Branham and brother Branham into discernment and he says when he's giving this testimony he says he's not going to go into what was said but in the desert he told her what she had done and she God forgave her and when he's given this testimony she's setting in the service and he says she's sitting here now and has the Holy Ghost he said but as a teenager a kid she had done some things she ought not to have done but who has it who hasn't if it isn't grace we're all lost God had explained brother barristers in my life I've made many mistakes in come to you in my life I've made many mistakes I've done lots of things that's wrong I'll probably if I live much longer I'll do many more perhaps some of them will be stumbling blocks in your way I hope that you'll forgive me I was reading of Abraham how that the frustrations he had my the things he did he doubted God he lied about his wife and everything but when his Divine commentary was written in Romans 4 it never mentioned his mistakes but it said Abraham never staggered at that unbelief through God but was strong all his mistakes were all forgotten when his divine commentary of his life was written his frustrations wasn't even mentioned his mistakes wasn't mentioned brethren I hope that when my commentaries read that day he'll rub mine out too and won't think about him that hope he do too how many can say that when the God writes you divine commentary God don't make mistakes but mention how I loved you hallelujah talk about how I gave myself talk about how I surrendered talk about how I believed in an age when friends you might not think it but it's a hard age that we're living in very hard age the stand Sammy if you want to come I'm gonna break Heavenly Father lord I thank you tonight for this message you laid on my heart Lord I believe

blessed be the name of the Lord what a what a precious reality you know I think the Lord put it so well you know here tonight you know when it all comes down to it it's the life that's what it all comes down to is the desire on the inside that's the real change that's the real baptism of the Holy Ghost as you know I think you're with sister Bruce you know I was actually in one years ago was naturally ministering there in brother Tim Humes assembly and I was speaking on with referring to that right there well brother Tim got up and he gave some background on it and he said concerning sister Bruce and the reason this interview was some of you have shared this with some of you too maybe don't know this sister Bruce is not the one who requested the interview brother Branham was and the reason brother Branham requested the interview is because sister Bruce was going around to sister Humes and different ones and said I wish I had what you have that put a whole new light on reading this so brother Brandon heard this that she was going around and saying this I wish I had what you had sister sister Humes I wish I had what you had so brother Brent said he calls this interview he calls it and when you read that interview as brother jury was ministering from tonight she wanted something as she asked she said twice she asks the question I want something I want that I could put my foot on that I know I've got the Holy Ghost brother Brown never tied her to a feeling to an emotion now you can have a feeling and have an emotion you know what truly that the experience itself is where you pass from death unto life you know within yourself that you've been changed and you know you didn't do it that's the miracle that's the paradox that's the new birth that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and no matter whatever comes or goes there's not there's not enough Devils out of hell could ever talk to you out of it because you know that you know that you know something and I think you're just beautiful how the Lord brought it that even when you in yourself it seems like you've turned loose but you can't give up because you've got the one on the inside of you are you hearing me now the one on the side of inside of you and me who never gave up he never gave up when Noah Noah Noah and his failure he never gave up as was preached tonight with Abraham he don't quit so if you got the one who don't quit then how could you quit see that's a reality that desire a living God on the inside I'm telling you friends I'm so thankful for the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know what I'm thankful for I'm thankful for what the true evidence is where you can look and I can look in my own life and you know it's that desire on the inside where you know I'm not the same person what happened he changed me I'm not the person that I was amen glory be to God glory be to God don't you love the Lord I tell you many services you know that you can come back to but as I think
