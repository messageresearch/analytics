[35:35] praise the Lord
[35:37] amen is that how you feel amen sometimes
[35:41] that's not how I feel
[35:44] sometimes that's not how I feel but
[35:46] that's the resolution in my heart
[35:48] regardless of how I feel I'm going to
[35:50] praise the Lord
[35:53] you know sometimes it takes on a whole
[35:55] new meaning when it says offer to the
[35:56] Lord a sacrifice of praise
[35:59] sometimes it's not hard to
[36:02] offer up praise to the Lord
[36:05] but at some of the times when it
[36:07] it seems lean
[36:09] or it seems like nothing's happening
[36:12] or all things all around can be very
[36:14] discouraging but that's the time to
[36:16] praise him
[36:18] so many examples in the scriptures that
[36:20] we we draw from in that time
[36:23] David he encouraged himself
[36:26] in the word of the Lord
[36:28] you know it wasn't just the enemies that
[36:30] was around David and what the
[36:32] Philistines had done
[36:34] but the OWN
[36:36] the men that were around David
[36:38] had become discouraged and they were
[36:42] ready to Stone him
[36:43] it's one thing for your enemies
[36:45] but it's another thing when you have
[36:48] those that are close around you
[36:50] but David did
[36:52] what a Seed of Abraham will do
[36:55] and he reached in the script bag of
[36:58] God's word and he began to encourage
[37:01] himself in the things of God
[37:04] and I believe that's why we're here this
[37:06] morning we're here
[37:08] to receive from God that we might
[37:10] encourage ourselves in the things of God
[37:14] so what a what a privilege it is a man
[37:18] to come together what
[37:19] what what things can happen here this
[37:22] morning
[37:23] amen
[37:25] I'm going to ask you to be seated but
[37:27] before you do would you turn around and
[37:28] shake hands with someone and just
[37:30] welcome them to the house of the Lord
[37:32] say it's good to see you
[37:49] amen it's so good to
[37:52] see each and every one and
[37:54] we've um it certainly feels good I know
[37:57] for my wife and myself it feels good to
[37:59] feel good
[38:00] and um
[38:02] some of you you many are not aware of it
[38:05] but not this past week but the week
[38:07] before last
[38:08] my wife I think she loved me so much she
[38:11] decided to share some of her kidney
[38:12] stones with me
[38:14] and so not this past Monday but the
[38:16] Monday before early in the morning of
[38:18] three or whatever woke up and so
[38:21] um they took me to the emergency room
[38:24] and I guess I got to experience
[38:26] everything I've had to stand there and
[38:27] watch you know from her but uh God was
[38:30] good and I appreciate the nurses and the
[38:32] different ones that attended and the
[38:35] pain I subsided and things just
[38:38] continued to move and now it brings in
[38:41] my mind a whole new thought I think oh
[38:42] Lord when I'm traveling overseas
[38:45] so you know I've got said oh my you know
[38:48] it's uh something you know you start
[38:50] feeling a little bit of a twinge or
[38:52] something like that but um
[38:54] I thank God for his mercy and God is so
[38:58] good he's so good to us and you know
[39:00] sometimes how God will allow us to come
[39:03] through experiences and it just makes us
[39:05] even more compassionate and more
[39:07] understanding and greater sympathy amen
[39:10] for others when they are going through
[39:12] things you know how it is when you're
[39:13] dealing with pain or sickness sometimes
[39:15] it's what's so hard for me is it seems
[39:17] like I don't even remember what it feels
[39:18] like to feel good
[39:20] and it could just be even you know
[39:23] sickness we came through in this past
[39:24] weekend and it's so foreign do you think
[39:26] how does that feel to feel good and yet
[39:29] you were feeling good however many days
[39:30] out of the year but I'm grateful for the
[39:33] grace of God Amen and through it all God
[39:36] is truly our comfort so we just
[39:38] certainly are so thankful for that I
[39:41] want to just say I was so uh so so
[39:44] um thankful when I heard
[39:46] the report on sister Anna I know my wife
[39:48] had shared that with me and I know we
[39:50] had been praying about those things even
[39:52] before that test and so I was just so
[39:54] thankful the other day and that was a
[39:56] great relief to my heart and when she
[39:59] came and told me the other day and so
[40:01] we're just so thankful to the Lord amen

[41:07] times so uh also there's a card out
[41:10] there for uh for brother Tommy uh for
[41:13] those of you my father-in-law that you
[41:15] would sign that and
[41:17] everything that we've had going on even
[41:20] from this past week uh the last time I
[41:22] actually seen my father-in-law was last
[41:23] Saturday because I didn't want to get
[41:25] around him with the sickness and things
[41:26] that we've had and and so forth and um
[41:29] but um it's Jeff something I'm so glad
[41:32] that God has uh brought him home safely
[41:35] and he's doing he's doing well and you
[41:37] get a chance to call him or text him and
[41:40] that would be a great blessing amen you
[41:42] know brother Brandon said it like this
[41:44] in the message and um he said you know
[41:47] sometimes he said you don't realize how
[41:50] important that is for someone to come
[41:53] and see you or or to send something and
[41:55] he says this he said but when it when
[41:57] our mother my mother was going through
[41:59] it he said then he says when I seen the
[42:01] others coming and sending you know they
[42:04] didn't send texts but a phone call he
[42:06] said man you realize just how much that
[42:08] means to you during that and we're a
[42:11] body aren't we
[42:12] I said we're a body aren't we amen and
[42:15] soul you know it's it's it's kind of
[42:18] like you know waiting around to see well
[42:19] who's going to clean up well just glad
[42:21] let's let's grab the bloom broom and
[42:23] let's start and see if others are going
[42:24] to join us amen let's not wait for
[42:27] somebody to start it let's just be the
[42:28] the little twig that gets it going amen
[42:31] so I want to remind you that this coming
[42:34] weekend that's what I wanted to just
[42:37] take a few minutes here in this in the
[42:39] moment before we bring brother Daniel
[42:40] out this coming weekend we have our
[42:42] annual uh Memorial Day Services coming
[42:45] up and um I'm just thankful that God has
[42:49] provided for that and provided for us to
[42:51] be able to
[42:52] host that and you know the objective
[42:56] that everything that we we have even
[42:58] when we have special meetings it's for a
[43:01] special time
[43:02] it's for a special moment it's a time
[43:04] that we're able to step aside and you
[43:07] know when Moses first went with
[43:08] deliverance and with that message his
[43:10] request was is a three-day meeting in
[43:14] the wilderness
[43:15] and they said
[43:16] no we're not going to let you do that
[43:19] and remember then from that point then
[43:22] here's where all the plagues and
[43:23] everything started coming but the first
[43:25] request is let us have a three-day
[43:26] journey in the wilderness that we may go
[43:29] and worship God to separate from the
[43:32] labors from the regular routines of Life
[43:34] how many know that we get into regular
[43:36] routines
[43:38] yeah you know even in church you get
[43:39] into your regular seat you get into your
[43:41] regular parking place you your regular
[43:43] songs everything becomes regular and
[43:45] what happens is it becomes common and
[43:48] that's where the battle that we have to
[43:49] we see that weakness about us within
[43:52] humans and that we have to battle
[43:53] through that and so God gives us an
[43:55] opportunities in times like this that we
[43:57] might be refreshed in the presence of
[43:59] the Lord and I'll tell you if there ever
[44:01] was a time that the people of God need
[44:03] to be refreshed need to be strengthened
[44:05] need to be encouraged every time as the
[44:07] prophet said that we need a juniper tree
[44:09] it's right now a place to be refreshed
[44:13] Amen in his presence and I'm I'm
[44:16] thankful that God has provided that for
[44:19] us and I know with brother Nathan Bryant
[44:21] brother Nathan I have become good
[44:24] friends here over the past years and I
[44:27] know that with the ministry you will you
[44:30] will definitely we will be blessed and
[44:33] um I just am so looking forward to that
[44:36] for that time I want to just I I looked
[44:39] out there and I seen on the menu and
[44:41] I've seen where it looks like now
[44:43] there's only
[44:45] a few blanks that are left on there and
[44:47] man was I encouraged to see that
[44:50] uh because you know it takes so it takes
[44:53] a body to put everything on when you
[44:55] when you something like this and you
[44:57] have to have all the efforts and all
[44:59] hands on board to do it but there's a
[45:01] reason that it's it's worth it I know
[45:02] it's a labor but it's a labor for all
[45:05] and and we but there's a cause and
[45:07] there's a purpose and just to think that
[45:09] within it's all said and done the
[45:11] laboring that has been done within it
[45:13] what a blessing that waits in store for
[45:16] you and I
[45:17] uh what a blessing it is to be able to
[45:19] serve what a blessing it is to be able
[45:21] to give and you think back to that
[45:22] little woman who cleans she I don't
[45:25] think she had any help at all she
[45:26] cleaned that whole horse star like we
[45:28] said last Sunday she did it she did it
[45:29] all and had a service and here one man
[45:31] who came to the Lord Dwight Moody she
[45:34] got a burden on her heart I say oh God
[45:36] may may we have a burden and just
[45:38] operate in it don't just let God bring
[45:40] it and bring make the way open for you
[45:42] you know and sometimes I know we have a
[45:44] burden and it's kind of looking at Lord
[45:45] how do I fulfill this or express it and
[45:47] you know if there's something you have
[45:49] in your heart talk to me about it or
[45:50] talk to us about it we'll make sure if
[45:52] God's put a burden on your heart then we
[45:54] certainly want to work within that
[45:57] channel
[45:58] so the in the menu out there there are
[46:01] items that can be brought for the the
[46:03] picnic
[46:04] uh the only app the only thing that I
[46:06] didn't see out there on the blink was
[46:08] appetite
[46:11] some of you will get that tomorrow I
[46:14] didn't see anything out there that says
[46:15] your hunger or your appetite or you know
[46:18] but that's still we understand that
[46:21] there's things so I would like you to
[46:22] look with look at that as you even are
[46:25] dismissed here because there are some
[46:27] things that are still needed there are
[46:28] multiple blinks I that are out there I
[46:31] said a couple of blanks but I did see
[46:32] some on the other
[46:33] um a paper where there's still some
[46:35] things with drinks and other things like
[46:37] that so please make your way by there
[46:39] and and just whatever can be done uh
[46:42] sister Amanda will be having a meeting
[46:44] here right after the service today in
[46:47] the back room just to the finishing
[46:49] touches and preparation so please make
[46:51] yourself available for that for the
[46:54] Sisters to fine tune that and make sure
[46:56] that we're all on board you know that
[46:59] we're having the fellowship dinner at
[47:01] the Mill Hollow reservation shelter
[47:03] number one so
[47:06] um it kind of was the elected to do that
[47:08] and because the Presbyterian Church we
[47:11] did have that rent but at the time it
[47:13] was not known whether they were going to
[47:15] have their air conditioning fixed or not
[47:16] so they had just been able recently to
[47:19] do that but there's also the part with
[47:20] the Presbyterian Church it works nice in
[47:23] the winter time to preserve us from the
[47:25] elements but the difficult time
[47:27] difficult in these moments is when the
[47:30] kids want to go and play and there's
[47:31] such a busyness that's through there and
[47:34] as kids kids want to go and play you
[47:36] know when we had church fellowships when
[47:38] I was younger I that's all I thought
[47:39] about sometimes I didn't even eat I know
[47:41] it didn't look like it but it was true I
[47:44] went there to play football and
[47:45] volleyball and have a good time and so
[47:48] kids want to play and so we I you know
[47:51] there was there's such a business there
[47:52] sometimes and we have to watch that and
[47:54] so that was where it was elected to have
[47:56] it there at Mill Hollow at shelter
[47:59] number one so
[48:01] you might want to bring lawn chairs if
[48:04] you would like to have some other
[48:05] comfortable seating to set in and one
[48:08] other announcement that I wanted to and
[48:11] something to put before you is that
[48:13] you know last year in the fall and I had
[48:16] a burden on my heart for some time to
[48:18] begin having things here at the church
[48:20] fire pit and having things here we have
[48:22] the facilities we have the use we have
[48:24] the things and the parking is set up and
[48:27] everything is to be used as a facility
[48:29] and so and uh that's something that I
[48:33] would looking at with the weather
[48:35] permitting and it looks very promising
[48:37] is that we would be able to have a
[48:39] possible fire pit Fellowship on that
[48:41] Sunday evening and uh is everybody still
[48:44] with me
[48:46] so uh brother Shane he's done a
[48:48] fantastic job with with this in the past
[48:51] of uh from the very on start of on on
[48:54] part of it when I had conveyed just the
[48:57] burden and the vision he took it and
[48:58] went with it and to get all that set up
[49:01] um but this year he and sister Lily had
[49:04] some deliberating on a wedding that they
[49:06] had to go to and so he's not going to be
[49:09] able to to be here but we just need I'm
[49:12] asking for a volunteer of volunteers
[49:14] that would be able to set up the fire
[49:17] pit and get the firewood
[49:19] and we can help with that but we are
[49:22] definitely going to need some help to
[49:24] get that set up and I know there's some
[49:26] things with some of the dirt and we can
[49:28] kind of get that crowd off and things
[49:30] but I really want to use the facility if
[49:33] we're going to do it I want to use the
[49:34] facility here to do that with because of
[49:37] the parking and everything that we have
[49:38] and so if someone would be willing to do
[49:41] that please see me that would be a great
[49:44] blessing the reason is we've got
[49:46] families there will be families that
[49:48] will be coming in I don't even know the
[49:51] amount that's coming in I know that
[49:53] there's been a lot of response
[49:55] immediately when we everything was
[49:56] posted with the meetings and sent out
[49:58] but I think it would be a great blessing
[50:01] and opportunity for fellowship and
[50:03] testimonies and worship because God is
[50:07] doing and he's going to do great things
[50:10] if there's one thing in this comings in
[50:12] this coming week I just ask you to
[50:14] really be in prayer and just be into
[50:17] under come under a place of expectation
[50:19] because no matter what the need is God
[50:22] is more than enough
[50:24] if it's healing God Is A Healer if it's
[50:28] Deliverance God is a deliverer and so we
[50:32] just want to be under a real expectation
[50:35] and really being in prayer for the
[50:37] services for what God is going to do
[50:40] because I believe there are pointed
[50:42] moments there are pointed times for us
[50:44] and we don't know how many more times
[50:46] that we have like this but we want to
[50:48] make the most of it being in prayer for
[50:50] it how many knows that prayer the prayer
[50:53] it availeth much amen and when God's
[50:57] people begin to pray and begin to call
[50:59] on God there are needs all around us but
[51:02] I'd just say if there's one prayer that
[51:04] we could all have as a resounding prayer
[51:06] is God may you move in a very special
[51:09] way and pour out of your spirit Lord
[51:11] every single need I think it's we can
[51:15] ask for every single need and say God
[51:18] that you would meet every single need
[51:20] I think that's part of standing in this
[51:23] hour and not being ashamed of the word
[51:26] that's come
[51:27] amen when brother Brown preached that
[51:29] message of being ashamed in 1965 he
[51:32] comes to the end of it he says I find he
[51:34] says I think even in myself he said you
[51:36] find where you're almost asking the
[51:38] devil to leave and apologizing to him he
[51:41] said we should not be that way we adjure
[51:44] him to leave in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:47] as Sons and Daughters of God that's
[51:49] being unashamed of the authority of the
[51:52] word in this hour amen we have an
[51:56] authority in Jesus Christ may not look
[51:58] like much but remember it's not the size
[52:01] of the policeman that badge says all of
[52:04] City Hall is behind him and there's a
[52:07] badge of believer the token of the Holy
[52:09] Ghost that when we stand on God's word
[52:10] then all of Heaven is behind the word of
[52:13] God Amen so we just love the Lord and I
[52:18] just ask once again that if anyone would
[52:20] be willing to do that and to set up that
[52:22] with the fire pit and the firewood and
[52:25] getting those things arranged would you
[52:26] please see me whether it after service
[52:28] here today or at some point that would
[52:31] be a great great help because I know
[52:33] even with the the volleyball setup and
[52:37] and so forth for and activities to be
[52:39] done out here and we just want we want
[52:41] to be a blessing
[52:42] is that right I want to be a blessing
[52:45] when God told Abraham he said not only
[52:46] will you be blessed but you will be a
[52:48] blessing
[52:49] and so we want to be a blessing amen and
[52:52] I just I love I love the people of God
[52:54] and we're just so grateful to be
[52:56] together I ask you to forgive me for
[52:59] these few moments of time but I had to
[53:01] had to take him and uh we want to just
[53:04] invite brother Daniel to come and
[53:06] minister in my what a what a wonderful
[53:09] service on Thursday evening
[53:12] God ministered such words of comfort and
[53:14] strength to our hearts and our lives
[53:16] that the angel of the Lord is encamped
[53:20] around about those that fear Him and
[53:22] love him
[53:23] and do you realize that as brother
[53:24] Daniel makes his way forward do you
[53:27] realize that brother Ram said that
[53:28] Elisha when he prayed that way for God
[53:32] to open up the eyes of gehaza it wasn't
[53:34] that Elisha even saw the Angels brother
[53:37] brem said Elisha had seen that God had
[53:40] said it in his word and it was enough
[53:43] for Elijah
[53:45] that's where we stand as the Seed of
[53:47] Abraham once we've met God taste the
[53:51] Lord and see his good then everything
[53:53] that he said I don't need to see it I
[53:56] know that he's God and he will provide
[53:59] and he backs up everything that he's
[54:01] ever said you believe that this morning
[54:03] amen could we rise to our feet and maybe
[54:06] one more time
[54:08] I know brother Daniel's got some
[54:10] presentation here but maybe it'll kind
[54:11] of break a little bit
[54:13] um but let's just say

[56:31] then we put confusion into the camp of
[56:33] the enemy
[56:35] Avail yourself this morning let's
[56:37] worship God
[56:39] amen God bless all of us
[56:42] let's sit for
[56:45] a moment okay
[56:51] well
[56:53] I am happy to be with you again this
[56:56] morning
[56:57] and before we go into the word of the
[57:00] Lord
[57:03] the Lord I've certainly done so much
[57:06] so many things in our lives and
[57:08] sometimes we have to get time to
[57:10] testify to glorify his holy name amen I
[57:15] remember
[57:16] back home in a church there were so many
[57:20] challenges
[57:21] and I don't say the word there is
[57:26] because it goes on
[57:28] you know and uh notable one was our
[57:32] place of worship
[57:34] we've been moving from one place to
[57:36] another one school to another until now
[57:39] is not even permitted
[57:41] for you to go and get in a school to
[57:44] worship God
[57:46] and so we ended up looking for
[57:49] a property to
[57:51] kind of put up a building
[57:54] and you know it's not easy also because
[57:57] where we are in the country we are in a
[58:00] city and everything is so much High
[58:03] so I contacted my precious brother
[58:07] Samuel and I told him that brother this
[58:11] is our situation
[58:13] have already you know help out but I
[58:16] need your help
[58:19] we have to secure
[58:21] a land whether we like it or not
[58:25] and to my surprise
[58:27] but as someone did not hesitate at all
[58:30] hey zebra Daniel we are going to help
[58:32] you
[58:35] so
[58:38] swiftly
[58:40] then
[58:41] it came to our age
[58:44] and I know that it is you brethren
[58:48] who made it possible
[58:50] so I am here this morning to show my
[58:53] greatest appreciation
[58:55] to brother Samuel
[58:58] and all of you in this church
[59:02] that we so much appreciate your love
[59:06] your care your support
[59:10] and it make us feel that we are not
[59:12] alone
[59:14] because God bless you
[59:16] and uh just uh church God bless you
[59:19] oh I say God bless you
[59:22] yes when I say God bless you I expect to
[59:24] hear your response amen
[59:29] the amen is a stump
[59:33] a seal
[59:35] Let It Be
[59:37] so God bless you
[59:39] that's it
[59:41] amen you are not home
[59:45] so yes uh this is the property now the
[59:49] Lord by God's grace and the help of you
[59:52] brilliant we've been able to
[59:54] ah aqua
[59:57] everything is subtle everything is set
[1:00:01] that we are going to crack the ground
[1:00:04] and that day I don't know how I'll be
[1:00:06] jumping
[1:00:08] because almost 27 years now will be
[1:00:12] moving from one place to another one
[1:00:14] place to another one place to another
[1:00:17] um the unfortunate thing is that like I
[1:00:19] told you the city that we are in is uh
[1:00:22] more or less our industrial city so
[1:00:24] everything is very very expensive it's
[1:00:27] not easy to get land
[1:00:28] so there's a miracle that God rotted in
[1:00:31] our lives
[1:00:32] so that is it we've already hired a
[1:00:35] machine to clear the land
[1:00:38] clear the land and uh everything is
[1:00:41] prepared
[1:00:44] yeah
[1:00:46] and uh

[1:08:32] verse 8 and 9.
[1:08:37] and we'll read First Corinthians also
[1:08:40] chapter 2.
[1:08:43] Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 this book of
[1:08:46] the Lord shall not depart out of thy
[1:08:48] mouth
[1:08:49] but thou shall meditate therein day and
[1:08:52] night that thou mayest observe to do
[1:08:55] according to all that is written therein
[1:08:58] for then Thou shalt then
[1:09:01] for then thou shall make thy way
[1:09:03] prosperous
[1:09:05] and then thou shall have good sources
[1:09:08] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[1:09:11] of good courage be not afraid
[1:09:14] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:09:18] thy God is with thee with us forever
[1:09:21] thou goeth
[1:09:23] First Corinthians
[1:09:25] chapter 2
[1:09:33] .
[1:09:36] First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse
[1:09:38] 16.
[1:09:40] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[1:09:44] that he may instruct him
[1:09:46] but we have the mind of Christ
[1:09:49] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[1:09:51] of his word amen let's take our seats
[1:09:53] breathing
[1:09:57] and this morning
[1:09:59] if God will we are going to speak on
[1:10:03] a topic taking God's way
[1:10:08] so that means it's not your way
[1:10:13] the way of man is always
[1:10:17] not good
[1:10:20] by the way of the Lord
[1:10:23] is good
[1:10:26] I remember one time when
[1:10:28] Jesus Christ
[1:10:30] started
[1:10:32] to move from the second Ministry to the
[1:10:34] third Ministry
[1:10:37] which always separate the unbeliever
[1:10:40] from the believer
[1:10:43] he asked them
[1:10:46] he told them in fact
[1:10:48] time is coming
[1:10:50] you have to eat my flesh
[1:10:53] and drink my blood
[1:10:56] and the Bible says that when Jesus made
[1:10:59] that statement
[1:11:01] some of the disciples left
[1:11:06] they weren't one by one after they
[1:11:08] performed the Miracles
[1:11:11] right
[1:11:12] after they were witnesses to the
[1:11:14] Miracles that Christ performed
[1:11:17] after God Jesus blessed you know the
[1:11:20] food the bread the Tulips
[1:11:22] or Five Loaves and two fishes they
[1:11:25] enjoyed they took part of it
[1:11:29] um
[1:11:30] but when he started to preach something
[1:11:33] deeper
[1:11:34] they really know we cannot contain this
[1:11:37] so they left him
[1:11:40] and Jesus turn around
[1:11:44] and was only left with a 12.
[1:11:49] and he asked them a question
[1:11:52] will you also go
[1:11:57] will you desert
[1:11:59] me
[1:12:02] Jesus look at him
[1:12:04] and he said Lord
[1:12:06] to whom should we go
[1:12:10] where
[1:12:12] you are the only one
[1:12:14] that have the words of eternal life
[1:12:18] so in other words Peter that day
[1:12:22] was telling Jesus we cannot take our own
[1:12:25] way
[1:12:27] but we will go your way
[1:12:30] Hallelujah
[1:12:32] you take the way by inspiration
[1:12:35] and by revelation
[1:12:37] it is not anybody advice
[1:12:40] but your own choosing
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:46] you know the prophet preaches someone
[1:12:47] and he said choosing a bride
[1:12:49] it's just like that nobody to see you
[1:12:52] choose it right
[1:12:55] if you choose and you choose good praise
[1:12:57] God
[1:12:59] if you choose and you don't choose good
[1:13:01] praise God
[1:13:04] you cannot blame anyone
[1:13:06] so Peter said that day Lord to whom
[1:13:09] should we go
[1:13:12] you are the one that have eternal life
[1:13:14] the prophet said your Footprints means
[1:13:17] your possession
[1:13:19] your Footprints where you put your food
[1:13:22] is your possession
[1:13:25] but how do you take it
[1:13:27] do you go your own way
[1:13:30] or you go God's way
[1:13:33] that is the question that we are going
[1:13:34] to answer this morning beloved brothers
[1:13:36] and sisters
[1:13:39] amen how do you take it
[1:13:42] that is why God told Joshua
[1:13:45] let's go back to Joshua
[1:13:50] he knew
[1:13:52] that if you choose his way it's full of
[1:13:54] blessing
[1:13:56] but you if you go your own way it's
[1:13:58] causes
[1:13:59] so he told Joshua after the death of
[1:14:02] Moses
[1:14:03] he said now after the death of Moses the
[1:14:06] servant of the Lord
[1:14:08] it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto
[1:14:12] Joshua the son of none
[1:14:15] Moses ministers saying
[1:14:17] Moses my servant is dead
[1:14:20] now therefore arise
[1:14:23] go over this Jordan
[1:14:26] da
[1:14:27] and all these people unto the land which
[1:14:31] I do give to them
[1:14:34] even to the children of Israel
[1:14:38] every place that the soul of your food
[1:14:40] shall tread upon that have I given you
[1:14:45] as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness
[1:14:48] and this Lebanon even onto the Great
[1:14:51] River the river Euphrates or the land of
[1:14:55] the heat eyes
[1:14:56] and unto the great sea toward the going
[1:14:58] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[1:15:02] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:15:05] before thee
[1:15:06] all the days of thy life
[1:15:09] as I was with Moses
[1:15:11] so I will be with thee
[1:15:14] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:15:19] be strong and of good courage
[1:15:22] For unto these people shall thou divide
[1:15:24] for an inheritance the land which I
[1:15:28] swear unto their fathers to give them
[1:15:31] only be down strong and very courageous
[1:15:36] the thou Mayors observe to do according
[1:15:39] to all the law which Moses my servant
[1:15:42] commanded thee
[1:15:44] 10 not from it to the right hand or to
[1:15:47] the left
[1:15:48] thou mayest Prosper with a server thou
[1:15:52] do it
[1:15:54] verse 8 this book of the Lord shall not
[1:15:57] depart out of thy mouth
[1:16:02] but thou shall meditate
[1:16:05] during day and night
[1:16:10] the Thousand Years observed to do
[1:16:12] according to all not some
[1:16:16] oh
[1:16:19] that is written therein for them Thou
[1:16:22] shalt make thy way prosperous
[1:16:25] and then thou shall have good sources
[1:16:30] it's a promise direct from God
[1:16:33] how not I commanded thee
[1:16:35] be strong and of good courage
[1:16:38] be not afraid neither be thou dismayed
[1:16:42] for the Lord thy God is within without
[1:16:45] server thou goeth
[1:16:49] Hallelujah
[1:16:51] God
[1:16:53] desired
[1:16:56] that Joshua
[1:16:58] should lead his people
[1:17:00] after the death of Moses
[1:17:03] but God didn't make Joshua to go by his
[1:17:08] own choice
[1:17:11] God chose the way
[1:17:13] amen
[1:17:15] and that has been in the life of
[1:17:18] everyone
[1:17:19] God chose the way
[1:17:22] and he expects you to pass on that way
[1:17:27] by forgetting what you think is
[1:17:30] reasonable
[1:17:33] forgetting things that you think that is
[1:17:36] the good one
[1:17:37] you need to forget that
[1:17:40] and come God's way
[1:17:42] Hallelujah he said when you do that then
[1:17:46] you will be prosperous in your ways
[1:17:51] you cannot bless yourself it's God that
[1:17:53] blesses
[1:17:55] amen now let's equate this with
[1:17:58] Deuteronomy chapter 11 quickly
[1:18:03] Deuteronomy chapter 11
[1:18:13] verse 13.
[1:18:17] and it shall come to pass if yes
[1:18:20] diligently unto my commandment which I
[1:18:23] command you this day
[1:18:25] to love the Lord your God and to serve
[1:18:28] him with all your heart and with all
[1:18:30] your soul
[1:18:31] that I will give you the reign of your
[1:18:34] land
[1:18:34] in his new season
[1:18:37] the first Reign and the latter rain
[1:18:39] the Thousand Years Gather in thy come
[1:18:43] and then wine and thy oil
[1:18:47] and I will send grass in thy fields for
[1:18:51] thy cuttle now thou mayest eat and be
[1:18:54] full
[1:18:56] what a Blessed assurance
[1:18:59] take it to yourself
[1:19:01] that your heart be not deceived
[1:19:04] and yet turn aside and serve other gods
[1:19:07] and worship them
[1:19:09] and then the Lost Rod be Kendall against
[1:19:12] you
[1:19:13] and he shut up the heaven that there
[1:19:15] will be no rain and that the land yield
[1:19:18] not a fruit
[1:19:20] unless you perish quickly from of the
[1:19:23] good land which the lord giveth you
[1:19:27] therefore shall ye lay up this my words
[1:19:30] in your hearts

[1:23:06] so many people there are so many

[1:26:56] unto you
[1:26:58] behold
[1:27:00] I sat before you this day a blessing and
[1:27:04] a case
[1:27:07] a blessing if ye obey the Commandment of
[1:27:11] the Lord your God

[1:27:16] which I command you this day
[1:27:18] and a curse if ye will not obey the
[1:27:22] Commandments of the Lord your God but

[1:27:30] gods which he have not known
[1:27:35] which one are you taking
[1:27:38] or which one have you already taken
[1:27:41] the way of the Lord
[1:27:44] or the way of the world
[1:27:47] it came to a Time
[1:27:50] when Madame Naomi
[1:27:54] after he left Bethlehem
[1:27:57] because of hardship
[1:28:00] because of situation that was not
[1:28:03] favorable
[1:28:05] accepting the husband
[1:28:08] they found themselves in the land of
[1:28:10] Moab
[1:28:11] with their two sons
[1:28:13] ballon and children
[1:28:16] and the Bible says that
[1:28:18] this boy or this young man
[1:28:21] got themselves
[1:28:23] more British women
[1:28:25] and they married them
[1:28:28] but it will not play along
[1:28:32] Naomi
[1:28:34] lost the husband
[1:28:37] and the two sons who's supposed to have
[1:28:40] you know console her also died
[1:28:45] and the woman realized that no
[1:28:48] things has not gone well with me
[1:28:51] how can things go well with you when you
[1:28:54] leave the land of God
[1:28:57] you trust your own way
[1:29:01] they chose their own way
[1:29:04] so how will that be good with you
[1:29:09] man so Shake Yourself one day said no I
[1:29:12] have to go back
[1:29:15] I have to go back and serve my God
[1:29:17] no matter what
[1:29:19] because I came
[1:29:21] full and now I'm going back empty
[1:29:26] so this woman called the two
[1:29:29] daughters-in-law
[1:29:31] and told them
[1:29:33] ladies
[1:29:35] I am going back to my country
[1:29:38] because the Lord have dealt bitterly
[1:29:40] with me here
[1:29:42] allow me now
[1:29:43] go to your people
[1:29:45] and go and stay with them
[1:29:47] I release you
[1:29:49] perhaps you are no longer under any
[1:29:52] bondage
[1:29:53] go and make your life
[1:29:58] to women
[1:30:00] they had the same thing
[1:30:02] from the mouth of Naomi
[1:30:09] the Bible says
[1:30:12] oppa
[1:30:15] both of them cried of course when the
[1:30:19] woman was pouring out such a you know
[1:30:22] disheartening you know information to
[1:30:25] them because they love them they love
[1:30:27] her whatever you can take it
[1:30:29] but all of a sudden
[1:30:31] telling them that they should live there
[1:30:33] because she was going back to a place it
[1:30:35] sat in their heart and all of them cried
[1:30:39] but
[1:30:41] Ruth I'm sorry oppa the other woman with
[1:30:45] the prophet said that she represented
[1:30:46] the denomination
[1:30:50] she reached to Naomi and kiss her
[1:30:54] and went back home
[1:30:58] so what was the meaning of that kiss
[1:31:01] not there are there are pieces that are
[1:31:03] very dangerous you know that
[1:31:07] so when somebody is going to kiss you be
[1:31:09] bold and ask the person which type of
[1:31:11] Kiss is this
[1:31:14] is the kiss that is going to bring me
[1:31:17] blessing
[1:31:18] happiness or joy
[1:31:20] or a case of betrayer
[1:31:22] be bold and ask the person because
[1:31:24] somebody kissed Jesus Christ and he was
[1:31:27] killed
[1:31:30] Hallelujah so not all the kisses are
[1:31:34] only peace
[1:31:35] some are dangerous some are betrayal
[1:31:38] some are hypocrisy
[1:31:41] yes
[1:31:43] very good
[1:31:45] oppa please Naomi and she went back to
[1:31:50] worship kamash
[1:31:52] the idol
[1:31:55] but look at Ruth
[1:31:58] she said madam
[1:32:00] and treat me not to return from
[1:32:02] following thee
[1:32:04] for where you go I will go
[1:32:07] your people shall be my people
[1:32:09] your God shall be my God why you sleep
[1:32:13] there I will sleep when you die there I
[1:32:15] will die while you are buried there I'll
[1:32:17] be buried oh
[1:32:25] realize that if Naomi is going back to
[1:32:29] Bethlehem then she was going to the god
[1:32:33] of the Israelites
[1:32:35] so why don't I go with her
[1:32:38] that I may affiliate myself with the
[1:32:40] people of God
[1:32:42] I will not choose my way I will choose
[1:32:44] the way of the Lord
[1:32:48] and when nagami realized I know
[1:32:52] she couldn't compel Ruth to return she
[1:32:55] allowed her to follow her
[1:32:58] now when that went to the land
[1:33:01] and they saw Naomi and everybody was
[1:33:04] cheering her up you know that thing that
[1:33:06] he said
[1:33:07] he said don't call me Naomi call me Mara
[1:33:10] because the Lord have dealt bitterly
[1:33:12] with me
[1:33:13] God didn't deal bitterly with you it was
[1:33:16] your own choosing
[1:33:20] it was your own choosing
[1:33:22] but thank God that you have come back
[1:33:25] home
[1:33:26] hallelujah thank God that you have come
[1:33:29] back home now you are going to see the
[1:33:31] glory of God
[1:33:36] there was nothing for them to eat
[1:33:39] so one morning
[1:33:42] routul
[1:33:44] I'm sorry Naomi told Ruth
[1:33:47] Ruth
[1:33:49] why don't you go and look for a place
[1:33:52] that you can
[1:33:53] clean something and bring it home
[1:33:56] and Roots set off
[1:34:00] because rude have already taken God's
[1:34:02] way
[1:34:03] from the beginning
[1:34:05] God didn't live here
[1:34:10] God didn't leave her
[1:34:12] any step from that day God wrote to take
[1:34:15] it was God's Own Way
[1:34:18] yes
[1:34:19] there were so many fields
[1:34:22] that were that way you know Glenn they
[1:34:24] were harvesting
[1:34:26] but why didn't Root find herself in any
[1:34:29] of those lands but she found herself on
[1:34:33] the portion of the Christmas Redeemer
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:39] why
[1:34:41] why because she chose God's will
[1:34:47] let's open to rule chapter 2.

[1:35:19] no let me take it from uh

[1:35:24] and Boaz
[1:35:26] and because came from Bethlehem and said
[1:35:29] unto the Reapers
[1:35:30] the Lord be with you and they answered
[1:35:33] him the Lord blessed you
[1:35:35] then said by us unto his servant that
[1:35:38] was set over the Reapers who danced
[1:35:40] there is this
[1:35:42] when he saw Ruth
[1:35:44] my
[1:35:47] mind and a servant that was set over the
[1:35:49] Reaper's answered and said it is the
[1:35:52] more British themselves that came back
[1:35:54] with Naomi
[1:35:55] out of the country of Moab and he said I
[1:35:58] pray you let me glean and gather after
[1:36:02] the Reapers among the ships so she came
[1:36:05] and had continued even from the morning
[1:36:08] until now
[1:36:10] that she carried a little in the house
[1:36:13] then said but was unto Ruth
[1:36:17] yellow thou not my daughter
[1:36:20] go not to Glenn in another field
[1:36:25] all right yes
[1:36:27] another go from hands but abide here
[1:36:32] fast by my meetings
[1:36:35] let thy eyes be on the field
[1:36:39] that they do reap and go down after them
[1:36:43] have I not judged the young men
[1:36:46] that they shall not touch thee
[1:36:48] and when thou at a test go unto the
[1:36:52] vessel and drink of that which the young
[1:36:55] men have drawn
[1:36:58] Hallelujah
[1:37:01] then she fell on her face
[1:37:04] and bow herself to the ground
[1:37:06] and said unto him
[1:37:09] why have I found Grace in thy eyes
[1:37:15] that thou should take knowledge of me
[1:37:18] seeing I am a stranger
[1:37:22] why have thy how why have I found Grace
[1:37:26] in thy sight
[1:37:28] yes Ruth is asking all of us this
[1:37:32] question this morning
[1:37:35] why have I found Grace in thy sight
[1:37:38] can somebody give answer to Ruth this
[1:37:41] moment
[1:37:43] yes Ruth
[1:37:45] you have found favor in the face of the
[1:37:48] king's My Redeemer because you didn't go
[1:37:51] your own way but you went God's way
[1:37:55] that's why you'll find favor
[1:37:57] Hallelujah
[1:38:01] amen
[1:38:04] and Boaz answered and said unto her
[1:38:07] it had fully been showed me all that
[1:38:10] thou has done unto thy mother-in-law
[1:38:13] since the death of thy husband
[1:38:15] and how that has left thy father and thy
[1:38:19] mother and the land of thy Nativity
[1:38:22] and I come unto a people without knoweth
[1:38:25] not here to fall
[1:38:27] the Lord the Lord recompense thy Work
[1:38:31] and the full reward be given thee of the
[1:38:35] Lord God of Israel and the whose wings
[1:38:37] Thou Art come to trust
[1:38:40] amen
[1:38:42] there she said let me find favor in thy
[1:38:45] sight my lord for that thou has
[1:38:48] comforted me and for that thou has
[1:38:50] spoken friendly unto thy handmaid though
[1:38:53] I be not like unto one of thy handmaids
[1:38:57] and was said unto her
[1:39:00] at Meal Time
[1:39:02] come down hither
[1:39:04] and eat of the bread
[1:39:07] who
[1:39:09] what a favor
[1:39:11] spiritual food induces them
[1:39:14] is prepared for special people
[1:39:17] not all the people Boaz will not invite
[1:39:21] anybody to come to that barn and come
[1:39:24] and eat
[1:39:25] but look at what God did to Ruth
[1:39:28] because this woman chose the way of the
[1:39:32] Lord
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:35] and when she was risen up to glean but
[1:39:39] was commanded his young man
[1:39:41] saying let her glean even among the
[1:39:45] ships
[1:39:49] at the beginning she was just following
[1:39:51] the Reapers so that the ones that have
[1:39:53] been left are they gather but now the
[1:39:57] instruction has come from the man
[1:39:59] himself
[1:40:01] Authority this Authority note has come
[1:40:05] from himself he said let her glin even
[1:40:08] among the ships and reproach her not
[1:40:12] and not for also some of the handful of
[1:40:15] purpose for her and leave them that she
[1:40:18] may glean them and rebuke her not
[1:40:22] oh what a favor
[1:40:25] now root is not just only going to
[1:40:28] harvest or Glenn among the workers but
[1:40:32] for her sake instruction has gone forth
[1:40:36] they should deliberately leave the food
[1:40:39] behind them
[1:40:40] oh Hallelujah
[1:40:42] deliberately they should leave the food
[1:40:45] behind them so that rude can reach them
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:49] God's favor
[1:40:52] God's favor
[1:40:54] God's favor when you take God's way
[1:40:57] brothers and sisters there are abundance
[1:40:59] of blessings for you
[1:41:01] he promised Joshua he said walk in the
[1:41:04] way of my seven Moses and thou shall be
[1:41:07] prosperous
[1:41:09] and now it is up to you and I
[1:41:13] if we can walk that same way
[1:41:16] that's important of blessing awaits us
[1:41:20] let's take God's way
[1:41:22] amen
[1:41:25] and not the long story short
[1:41:28] we all know what happened when uh route
[1:41:31] went back home
[1:41:33] and broke this news to Naomi Naomi was
[1:41:37] so much excited
[1:41:39] and Naomi knew that something was fixing
[1:41:41] to happen
[1:41:42] Hallelujah if God opened one door
[1:41:46] million malls are open in that same door
[1:41:49] other lawyer if you tell God's way and
[1:41:52] the door is open onto you I say mean
[1:41:54] your mom are up in that same door
[1:41:57] so one day when uh
[1:42:00] Naomi heard that Boaz was going to you
[1:42:04] know we know his Bali or whatever they
[1:42:07] call it in those days then you call Ruth
[1:42:11] so now Naomi has become the prophetess
[1:42:13] of Ruth
[1:42:15] because she repented and went back to
[1:42:19] take her position
[1:42:20] in the house of God
[1:42:23] she remained the daughter of God
[1:42:25] no matter what what happened and she
[1:42:28] found herself in a string land she has
[1:42:30] come back
[1:42:31] so now she was instructing Ruth amen

[1:43:51] have been bid
[1:43:53] to wash ourselves
[1:43:56] we've washed ourselves from the unbelief
[1:44:00] of this world
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:02] we've washed ourselves from the doubt of
[1:44:05] this world
[1:44:07] we wash ourselves from the crookedness
[1:44:10] of this world
[1:44:11] and we have anointed ourselves with the
[1:44:14] Holy Spirit
[1:44:17] and we are set
[1:44:19] to mean the king's man

[1:44:33] drinking
[1:44:35] Hallelujah
[1:44:36] and it shall be
[1:44:38] when he lied down
[1:44:40] that thou shall make the place that's a
[1:44:43] mark the place where he shall lie and
[1:44:47] thou shall go in and uncover his feet
[1:44:50] and let me down and you will tell thee
[1:44:53] what thou shall do
[1:44:58] The Story Goes On and goes on and goes
[1:45:01] on and what happened was that after Boaz
[1:45:05] have done all this ceremony
[1:45:08] and he has got someone into his body oh
[1:45:12] brother and it is simulated him
[1:45:15] at night he went and lay
[1:45:19] but according to the instructions of
[1:45:21] Naomi he said when you see that go and
[1:45:25] uncover his skirt and lay beneath her
[1:45:28] foot
[1:45:30] and she would tell you what you will do
[1:45:36] so when Boaz went and lay Ruth did
[1:45:41] exactly the instruction from Naomi
[1:45:45] the Bible said that at midnight
[1:45:48] then was better
[1:45:50] and realize that somebody was lying you
[1:45:53] know beneath it he said who are you
[1:45:59] then Ruth will look at him

[1:46:18] she got the power to demand happiness
[1:46:21] she got the power to demand her Liberty
[1:46:24] because they needed a Kingsman Redeemer
[1:46:27] and he said the near Kingsman comfort me
[1:46:30] with your skirt
[1:46:33] and Naomi said that he will tell you
[1:46:36] what you will do
[1:46:39] and when Ruth made that statement
[1:46:42] but was understood
[1:46:44] and the one said well
[1:46:46] there is another man
[1:46:49] who is the the most nearer case man
[1:46:53] before myself
[1:46:55] so I will you know talk with him if he
[1:46:59] agreed to do the necessary thing then
[1:47:01] praise God but if he refused I oh
[1:47:06] Hallelujah
[1:47:07] I will do it
[1:47:13] and you know the story
[1:47:16] the first man refused
[1:47:18] because
[1:47:19] he said he cannot redeem Naomi and marry
[1:47:23] Ruth because Ruth was was a gentile
[1:47:28] the man didn't know his responsibility
[1:47:31] even though he was from the tribe of
[1:47:33] Judah he didn't know that the Judas they
[1:47:35] marry from the Gentile world
[1:47:38] Judah himself married a gentile
[1:47:41] salmon marry a gentile
[1:47:43] is that not it who again
[1:47:46] Boaz was going to marry a gentile
[1:47:50] David marry a gentile and Jesus Christ
[1:47:53] himself has marry a joint a woman
[1:47:57] so that man didn't have the capability
[1:48:01] to do the necessary thing
[1:48:05] was
[1:48:07] said don't worry
[1:48:09] I would do it
[1:48:12] and that same anointing
[1:48:16] That Came Upon rude that day to demand
[1:48:19] the world cover me with your scared in
[1:48:22] the same anointing that has come upon us
[1:48:26] Once Upon a Time
[1:48:29] we didn't know our left and right
[1:48:31] and that was a time when George saw the
[1:48:34] book still with Seven Seals in the right
[1:48:37] hand of he that sat upon the throne
[1:48:40] he didn't have any strength
[1:48:43] he didn't know anything about that but
[1:48:45] he realized that there was something in
[1:48:47] that book for him
[1:48:49] but what Authority
[1:48:52] did he have
[1:48:53] and started crying
[1:48:56] crying until he said he heard the voice
[1:48:59] calling him John
[1:49:01] stop crying
[1:49:04] for the lion of the tribe of Judah again
[1:49:06] Hallelujah
[1:49:09] has prevailed
[1:49:11] to unfold those seals
[1:49:16] and when he tells you look
[1:49:18] he saw a lamb
[1:49:20] full of blood
[1:49:23] um
[1:49:26] approaching the throne
[1:49:28] and he approached the throne
[1:49:31] and sees the book
[1:49:33] and open the first deal the second the
[1:49:37] third the fourth the fifth the fifth the
[1:49:40] seventh
[1:49:43] amen

[1:49:47] Boaz raised the script
[1:49:51] and he found a woman there
[1:49:53] and the woman said that cover me with
[1:49:55] the skirt

[1:50:35] even though it was hot
[1:50:37] they didn't have anything
[1:50:41] but
[1:50:42] she choices anyhow
[1:50:46] remember the ministry of the prophet
[1:50:50] when that man is it Danny Henry that
[1:50:53] spoke in the tongues in the French
[1:50:54] language
[1:50:55] right
[1:50:57] and there were so much three
[1:50:59] interpreters into the same thing
[1:51:02] and concerning the ministry of the
[1:51:03] prophet
[1:51:04] he said because
[1:51:07] that have chosen the the narrow part
[1:51:10] the other way
[1:51:13] thou have chosen
[1:51:15] on your own way
[1:51:18] and that is my way
[1:51:22] and because of momentous and precise
[1:51:26] decision you have taken

[1:51:59] and he said that
[1:52:02] in itself
[1:52:04] is that which make

[1:52:34] he said well now
[1:52:39] okay he said now we we now he said well
[1:52:43] now God just didn't go over there and
[1:52:46] take broom and swept out Canaan and all
[1:52:50] the amorites and the hitters and not
[1:52:53] them and send them out and said come on
[1:52:55] Israel this is yours
[1:52:58] they've even planted the crops for you
[1:53:00] no no sir
[1:53:03] they had to fight every inch of the way
[1:53:06] that is right
[1:53:08] but they had the promise of victory
[1:53:12] God told Joshua
[1:53:14] it wasn't easy God didn't take broom and
[1:53:17] saw the the what do we call it the
[1:53:19] enemies and the those unbelievers and
[1:53:22] asked Israel to go and take no
[1:53:24] they went to fight right
[1:53:27] all right rude people just got up and I
[1:53:31] mean Rich Bethlehem
[1:53:33] as your prospered no I know remember the
[1:53:37] prophet told us of the four stages of
[1:53:38] Ruth
[1:53:41] deciding
[1:53:45] root seven
[1:53:50] root rewarding
[1:53:53] or what no there's another one before
[1:53:55] rewarding something like that
[1:53:57] what
[1:53:58] God bless you
[1:54:01] and root rewarding
[1:54:04] four stages
[1:54:06] and every child of God if you want to
[1:54:09] choose God's way you go through that
[1:54:12] four stages
[1:54:15] Hallelujah
[1:54:18] amen he said they had to fight every
[1:54:20] inch of the way
[1:54:22] that is right but they had the promise
[1:54:25] of Victory God told Joshua wherever the
[1:54:28] soul of your food tread that I have
[1:54:31] given to you
[1:54:32] so Footprints meant possession
[1:54:36] yes amen
[1:54:40] now
[1:54:43] let's continue
[1:54:46] when Boaz
[1:54:49] realized that he has finished the
[1:54:52] connection or the agreement with the
[1:54:54] Ruth
[1:54:56] it's a Ruth
[1:54:58] before you go
[1:54:59] open your Veil
[1:55:03] and he gave her six measures of Bali
[1:55:10] six measures of Bali and when I check it
[1:55:13] it was almost 50 pounds
[1:55:16] that can take them enough days
[1:55:21] but the question is why would he give
[1:55:24] the woman six measures and not five and
[1:55:26] four
[1:55:27] come on brother the number six the
[1:55:30] number six is always a number of a man
[1:55:33] and we know who that man is
[1:55:35] and the number seven is always a mystery
[1:55:40] Hallelujah so if you want to know the
[1:55:43] seventh measure of the valley it was
[1:55:45] Boaz himself
[1:55:48] measure
[1:55:56] amen
[1:55:58] and you know what
[1:56:00] he said and she led it at his feet
[1:56:05] oh is that the place no he said and so
[1:56:08] and he said bring the veil that thou art
[1:56:11] upon thee and hold it and when she heard
[1:56:14] it he measured six measures of Bali and
[1:56:17] laid it on her and she went into the
[1:56:20] City and when she came to her
[1:56:23] mother-in-law she said who are thou my
[1:56:27] daughter
[1:56:29] and she told her all that the man had
[1:56:33] done to her
[1:56:34] and she said these six measures of Bali
[1:56:38] gave him me for he said to me go not
[1:56:41] empty unto thy mother-in-law
[1:56:44] then now one is said
[1:56:48] sit still my daughter
[1:56:51] until now know how the matter will fall
[1:56:56] there is a matter that was going to fall
[1:56:58] he says sit still and know the glory of
[1:57:02] God hallelujah for the man will not be
[1:57:07] in rest until he have finished the thing
[1:57:10] this day
[1:57:14] anything that you have learned before
[1:57:16] God
[1:57:18] when you have chosen the way of the Lord
[1:57:20] God will never rest
[1:57:25] Because of You beloved brothers and
[1:57:27] sisters God will never rest until he has
[1:57:31] finished everything that he's dealing
[1:57:32] with you
[1:57:34] again that you are put before God he
[1:57:37] says stay stand still and see the power
[1:57:40] of God
[1:57:41] Hallelujah Moses said the same thing
[1:57:45] when they came before the Red Sea and
[1:57:47] the people were murdering and were
[1:57:49] crying and he said hey people of Israel
[1:57:52] stands here and you see the glory of God
[1:57:55] this morning the Egyptian that you see
[1:57:58] you will never see them again in your
[1:58:01] life
[1:58:03] oh brother he said God will not rest
[1:58:07] until he has done everything
[1:58:10] God is Not resting in my life God is Not
[1:58:13] resting in your life God is Not resting
[1:58:15] in your life God will continue to
[1:58:17] perform what you need to perform
[1:58:20] Hallelujah
[1:58:22] there is nothing like choosing God's way
[1:58:25] that is why I love that song I want
[1:58:28] God's way to be my way

[2:06:31] meanwhile there have been one not to
[2:06:35] listen to Jesus Christ
[2:06:37] but when Christ got to that spot
[2:06:41] with millions of people surrounding him
[2:06:44] the woman said no
[2:06:47] even though they are saying Jesus is not
[2:06:49] good
[2:06:50] but I can feel something in him
[2:06:53] and there's something if only I can
[2:06:56] touch the hair of His Garment
[2:06:59] that would be not for me
[2:07:06] and the bible say that the woman crawl
[2:07:08] among the you know the tranche and was
[2:07:11] able to touch the hand of Jesus Christ
[2:07:15] then immediately
[2:07:17] Jesus said Peter somebody have touched
[2:07:19] me
[2:07:20] epita
[2:07:21] was a joke because how can you say that
[2:07:24] somebody after you master that when
[2:07:26] we're coming a lot of people were
[2:07:27] touching you here and there why do you
[2:07:30] say
[2:07:31] Jesus said Peter you don't know the kind
[2:07:34] of touch is this is
[2:07:36] right many people have touched me
[2:07:40] but that those were ordinary touches
[2:07:45] but this touch is a touch of demand
[2:07:51] a part of authority
[2:07:55] a touch of faith
[2:07:57] effect of Revelation
[2:07:59] because the woman said if I can touch
[2:08:03] who taught the woman that
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:07] who taught the woman
[2:08:09] no teases
[2:08:12] no geography
[2:08:14] compliment
[2:08:16] no historical information
[2:08:19] it was by Revelation you say if I can
[2:08:22] Touch the Hem of its garment I'll be
[2:08:24] made oh
[2:08:25] and immediately
[2:08:29] Jesus said that you have gone out of me
[2:08:32] oh Peter the touch of that woman have
[2:08:35] taken battle out of me
[2:08:38] oh brother that is still virtue in Jesus
[2:08:41] Christ this morning
[2:08:43] if you can reach him and touch him right
[2:08:45] now something will happen to your
[2:08:47] experience
[2:08:50] amen
[2:08:52] oh my God
[2:08:57] I feel good this morning
[2:09:00] Russell can I jump into the puppet right
[2:09:02] now
[2:09:04] I want my stature to be so big
[2:09:07] because I'm rejoicing in the Lord Jesus
[2:09:10] I have also entered into the variety
[2:09:12] store of Jesus Christ and are taking
[2:09:15] what belongs to me and nobody brother I
[2:09:18] said nobody can take it from me he said
[2:09:21] I have The Possession and you have your
[2:09:23] possession of everything that is in that
[2:09:26] Variety shop
[2:09:28] amen
[2:09:30] do you remember the story of the mama
[2:09:32] opposal
[2:09:34] even an animal
[2:09:36] a creature
[2:09:42] what told that creature
[2:09:44] that there was a man there that can pray
[2:09:47] for it
[2:09:49] all right that's so good sometimes I
[2:09:52] wonder about things of this nature but I
[2:09:56] cannot question God I only need to
[2:09:58] believe
[2:10:02] the creature didn't have soul
[2:10:07] to believe or not you know to disbelief
[2:10:12] but what happened
[2:10:13] that this creature with all wounds up in
[2:10:16] her body
[2:10:19] crawl the purpose that he was surprised
[2:10:22] how it was able to even claw the highway
[2:10:25] right and come and be at his door
[2:10:31] and he commanded him get out from here
[2:10:34] I can kill you
[2:10:36] he went inside and came out and the
[2:10:38] creature was still lying
[2:10:42] and then
[2:10:45] he realized I know something is at stake
[2:10:49] it took a clean look about the creature
[2:10:52] and he found out he needed help
[2:10:55] so he removed his heart
[2:10:57] and he knelt
[2:11:00] lay his hands
[2:11:02] and pray a simple prayer
[2:11:04] Lord if this is the reason why this
[2:11:07] creature is here Grant a desire
[2:11:12] and immediately
[2:11:15] all the wounds vanish
[2:11:20] even the mama opossum
[2:11:22] entered into Jesus Christ the right to
[2:11:25] store and took what he wanted
[2:11:28] how much more you

[2:13:17] out and reach to what you want in the
[2:13:19] Lord Jesus Christ

[2:13:25] where you want to take the pain from you
[2:13:27] need a ladder
[2:13:28] oh brother he said God have got a ladder
[2:13:33] in that shop

[2:13:45] belongs to you
[2:13:48] if you walk on God's way
[2:13:50] God will surely prove himself
[2:13:53] that he exists
[2:13:55] amen when God
[2:13:57] opened the way
[2:13:59] for Israel
[2:14:03] they rejected it
[2:14:06] they didn't take God's way they refused
[2:14:09] to go God's way
[2:14:11] Hallelujah
[2:14:14] and because they didn't receive John the
[2:14:16] Baptist when God's will come in the way
[2:14:19] of the Messiah they didn't see it
[2:14:22] and they crucified him
[2:14:25] I remember when Pharaoh I'm sorry a
[2:14:27] pilate asked them and what about Jesus
[2:14:31] they say crucify him
[2:14:33] they didn't want his way
[2:14:35] they trust their own way
[2:14:37] and that is why Israel have suffered
[2:14:40] till today
[2:14:41] they trust their own way you know what I
[2:14:44] love about this when they chose their
[2:14:46] own way and rejected the way of God God
[2:14:49] turned to be gentiles
[2:14:53] oh Hallelujah God tend to win let us
[2:14:57] read that scripture in closing okay
[2:14:59] I hope I'm not taking too much time
[2:15:01] amen
[2:15:03] let's read out Acts chapter 13 quickly
[2:15:08] amen
[2:15:09] Acts chapter 13
[2:15:12] we read in verse 44.
[2:15:20] Acts 13.
[2:15:22] and the next Sabbath day
[2:15:24] came almost the whole city together
[2:15:27] to hear the word of God
[2:15:29] but when the Jews saw the multitudes
[2:15:32] that they were filled with Envy
[2:15:35] see you not believe and we are believing
[2:15:37] and you are jealousy
[2:15:42] you got it
[2:15:43] and speak against those things which
[2:15:46] were spoken by poor contradicting and
[2:15:49] blasphemy
[2:15:50] then Paul and Barnabas Works bold and
[2:15:54] said it was necessary that the word of
[2:15:57] God should first have been spoken to you
[2:16:00] but seeing you put it from you
[2:16:03] and judge yourself on worthy of
[2:16:06] everlasting life law will turn to the
[2:16:09] Gentiles
[2:16:11] they rejected God's will
[2:16:14] and God brought the way to us oh man
[2:16:20] 47 for so had the Lord commanded us
[2:16:24] saying I have said thee to be a light of
[2:16:28] the Gentiles that thou should not be for
[2:16:30] salvation unto the ends of the Earth
[2:16:33] and when the Gentiles have this they
[2:16:37] were glad
[2:16:38] and they glorified the word of the Lord
[2:16:41] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[2:16:44] life believed it Hallelujah
[2:16:47] [Applause]
[2:16:50] that was the way of the Lord
[2:16:52] they rejected it and it came our way and
[2:16:55] we grabbed it praise be to the name of
[2:16:58] our god oh brother I am so glad
[2:17:02] that today you and I we are on God's way

[2:20:05] face shine upon us

[2:20:12] he said in the night in the day when we
[2:20:16] sleep when we sit we should meditate
[2:20:19] upon God's will
[2:20:21] amen God bless all of us
[2:20:23] [Applause]
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:47] stand
[2:20:52] thank you
[2:20:53] I know today is not Thanksgiving but yet
[2:20:56] it is
[2:20:58] you know to a real believer every day is
[2:21:01] a Thanksgiving for what God has
[2:21:03] has done for us
[2:21:05] and you know it's just isn't it so
[2:21:07] precious how the Holy Spirit just takes
[2:21:09] the words those things which we know
[2:21:12] which we've heard maybe it's your first
[2:21:14] time hearing it but for some of us
[2:21:16] things that we've heard but God has a
[2:21:19] way of so inspiring things afresh to us
[2:21:22] for presently right now
[2:21:26] that's the difference between man and
[2:21:28] God
[2:21:29] has given us his word it's a lamp unto
[2:21:32] our feet and it's God shows us that the
[2:21:35] word of God is just as inspired it might
[2:21:38] have been a promise that inspired you a
[2:21:40] month ago might have been a year ago but
[2:21:43] for the present need God can come right
[2:21:45] back around and Inspire that word
[2:21:47] because it's all him making himself
[2:21:49] known I am the ever-present god in your
[2:21:54] need in your situation and in your life
[2:21:56] my goodness what a what a comfort it is
[2:22:00] what a comfort to think of when we put
[2:22:03] ourselves where Ruth was because Ruth
[2:22:05] her life though she and herself never
[2:22:08] prophesied with her mouth but through
[2:22:11] her life being yielded to God it was a
[2:22:14] prophecy of the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[2:22:16] this hour
[2:22:17] and we see that that it's something that
[2:22:20] Hal Ruth she just trusted she rested and
[2:22:24] there was a tug that was in her heart
[2:22:26] but REM tells us in the Holy Ghost
[2:22:28] series he said what it was he said that
[2:22:30] Vision that caught a hold in Ruth's
[2:22:31] heart what it was is there was a purpose
[2:22:34] to be fulfilled amen and Ruth pressed on
[2:22:39] I just think you know what what what uh
[2:22:43] encouragement that in the midst of every
[2:22:46] part of the journey at times we have to
[2:22:48] push times you have to press That's all
[2:22:50] part of this Moment In the Journey
[2:22:53] amen
[2:22:55] but what is so precious is is when you
[2:22:58] have chosen God's way that God has set
[2:23:01] before us and said this is my way
[2:23:03] and when we would choose that way that
[2:23:05] God has already laid out before us this
[2:23:08] is my way then we can expect the
[2:23:11] accompaniment of God in every step of
[2:23:14] the way I'm so glad about that I tell
[2:23:17] you this morning certainly I believe
[2:23:19] that we have been encouraged
[2:23:21] amen we have been encouraged
[2:23:24] amen
[2:23:26] Hallelujah and God will see us through
[2:23:29] all the way
[2:23:31] all the way he is a God that whatever he
[2:23:34] begins he finishes
[2:23:37] amen he's not like some of us who may
[2:23:39] have a reputation of don't let that
[2:23:41] person start on your house don't let
[2:23:43] them do a project because if they start
[2:23:45] the project good luck you'll be left
[2:23:47] with an unfinished project you know I've
[2:23:50] known people like that you don't let
[2:23:51] them start you don't let them forget it
[2:23:53] you might want it but forget it I don't
[2:23:54] really want it because why you'll just
[2:23:56] see something unfinished not God
[2:23:59] and God knew exactly what he was getting
[2:24:01] into when he chose you and I
[2:24:04] he saw all of our failures he saw all of
[2:24:07] our mistakes so he certainly did not
[2:24:09] choose US based on our own stability he
[2:24:12] chose us because we were a part of him
[2:24:15] and he cannot deny himself amen we come
[2:24:18] from God and we're going back to God
[2:24:21] Amen Let us let's press with everything
[2:24:23] that's within us how many say I'm
[2:24:26] willing to press willing to push willing
[2:24:29] to obstacles that as brother Daniel
[2:24:31] Illustrated their obstacles then in a
[2:24:33] way move it out of the way
[2:24:35] don't let the obstacle determine and say
[2:24:37] ah the obstacle's too great I it must
[2:24:39] not be for me no the obstacle is there
[2:24:41] to test where is your faith
[2:24:44] our faith is in Jesus Christ and This
[2:24:47] Promise is for me so if I've got to pray
[2:24:51] that obstacle out of the way I'm going
[2:24:52] to pray it out of the way because what I
[2:24:54] have need of is in the Lord and I'm
[2:24:57] going to get there
[2:24:59] brother said if it's a promise that's up
[2:25:00] a little bit too high he said get that
[2:25:02] ladder of prayer and climb up there and
[2:25:04] get it
[2:25:05] oh my I think God for his Mercy what
[2:25:10] encouragement amen what encouragement
