[31:28] how do you why don't you turn to shake
[31:31] someone's hand as you're being seated so
[31:37] good to be in the house of the Lord I
[31:39] was glad when they said unto me let us
[31:43] go unto the house of the Lord Amen
[31:47] hallelujah
[31:49] are you happy this morning amen glory be
[31:53] to God
[31:54] oh my unless it be the name of the Lord
[31:59] I before asked brother Adam and sister
[32:04] Boulder bring a little faith forward
[32:06] here
[32:06] you know these scriptures
[32:10] we've been ministering off of so this
[32:13] inspiration here for a while and will
[32:15] you see that the Lord Jesus you know he
[32:18] never told them to bring the children
[32:21] unto Him but they began to recognize a
[32:24] presence that was in his life and they
[32:27] began to bring the little children unto
[32:29] Him if he had told them to do that then
[32:33] the disciples would never have rebuked
[32:34] those who were doing it but you see the
[32:37] disciples were looking at something and
[32:39] such a greatness of what God was doing
[32:42] in that moment in that hour and yet they
[32:46] themselves did not even have the full
[32:48] understanding of what God was really
[32:51] doing in that hour because it hadn't
[32:54] been revealed inside of them but it was
[32:57] something that was so real to where that
[33:00] it had drawn them from all of their
[33:03] walks of life it wasn't that Peter still
[33:05] wasn't a fisherman it wasn't that they
[33:08] still didn't have the skills of those
[33:10] things it's just that him walking in
[33:13] their midst took preeminence over all
[33:16] other things in their lives and then as
[33:20] the people began to witness this working
[33:24] that was taking place they began to
[33:25] bring children to him and the Bible says
[33:28] that he should touch them they just
[33:31] wanted him to touch them and and we find
[33:34] that within this the disciples looked at
[33:36] it
[33:37] and they said this why why would we do
[33:41] this
[33:41] you don't bother him don't trouble him
[33:44] but you see the Lord Jesus reminded us
[33:47] that we're never in the midst of the
[33:50] greatness of God God's greatness does
[33:53] not create a puffed up Ness but God's
[33:56] greatness brings humility that God is
[34:00] concerned about the very least aren't
[34:05] you glad this is an effect and this is
[34:08] something that keeping in mind see their
[34:10] Lord Jesus was instructing them there
[34:12] don't get so much out on your own but
[34:15] recognizing what the greatness of God
[34:17] has come to do and God took this example
[34:20] here of the children and said for such
[34:22] is the kingdom of God and there's things
[34:26] that we want to be grown up in but
[34:28] there's things we want to be simple as
[34:30] children amen and you know God knows
[34:34] just how to bring that balance in our
[34:35] life he knows how to bring the maturity
[34:37] where it's needed to be and he knows how
[34:40] to work and condition in our life to
[34:42] where it stays as simple as a little
[34:44] child
[34:45] I'm glad aren't you and if we find this
[34:48] in the scripture if you have your Bibles
[34:50] if you were read with me in Genesis 48 I
[34:53] want to take you to this place in
[34:55] Genesis 48 because when they led brought
[34:59] the children to the Lord to the Lord
[35:01] Jesus they brought him to them to him
[35:03] that he should touch them and that he
[35:05] might bless them you know blessing is
[35:08] not just something that's of emptiness
[35:10] it's something that has a meaning it's
[35:14] an effect blessing itself even there in
[35:17] the Hebrew barak which is its annealing
[35:19] it's a blessing it is a respect it is a
[35:22] commending of one to another it's an
[35:24] action that takes place aren't you glad
[35:28] that the blessing of God is in action
[35:31] the blessing of God puts us into action
[35:35] it doesn't just bring a sensation it
[35:38] puts us into action so here I want to
[35:41] just read this scripture before we ask
[35:43] for the atom of sister bow to come in
[35:46] Genesis 48 verse 8 the Bible says Israel
[35:49] beheld Joseph's sons and said who are
[35:52] these Joseph said unto his father they
[35:55] are my sons
[35:56] whom God hath given me in this place and
[36:00] he said bring them I pray thee unto me
[36:03] and I will bless them see he's asking
[36:08] who are these jenkum knew who they were
[36:10] but he's asking them do you know who
[36:13] they are these are the children that God
[36:17] hath given me God hath given me so what
[36:22] he's doing is claiming his inheritance
[36:24] do you know this is my this is my
[36:27] inheritance now the Bible says in verse
[36:30] 10 the eyes of Israel were dimmed for
[36:31] age so that he could not see and he
[36:33] brought them near unto Him and he kissed
[36:35] them and embraced them then if you if
[36:39] you turn with me over here in that same
[36:41] chapter and then the Bible says in verse
[36:44] 13 and Joseph took them both Ephraim in
[36:48] his right hand toward Israel's left hand
[36:50] and Manasseh in his left hand toward
[36:52] Israel's right hand and brought them
[36:54] near unto Him and Israel stretched out
[36:57] his right hand and laid it upon Eve
[36:59] Rome's head who was the younger and his
[37:01] left hand upon manassas head guiding his
[37:04] hands wittingly for Manasseh was the
[37:07] firstborn and he blessed Joseph and said
[37:10] God before whom my father's Abraham and
[37:13] Isaac did walk the God which fed me all
[37:16] my life long unto this day the angel
[37:21] which redeemed me from all evil blessed
[37:24] the latter Lance not just me but the
[37:28] angel which redeemed me that angel that
[37:32] I wrestled with all night that same
[37:33] angel that same one blessed these lads
[37:35] the same one who redeemed me blessed
[37:38] these lads and let my name be named on
[37:42] them and the name of my father's Abraham
[37:44] and Isaac and let
[37:46] grow into a multitude in the midst of
[37:49] the earth what a reality is we stand
[37:54] here a dedication of the children we
[37:59] know that it's not just it's not a form
[38:02] but as we stand here in each time
[38:06] together we are declaring God this is a
[38:11] child that you have given to our union
[38:15] and we are dedicating it back to you and
[38:18] that dedication is just like that of
[38:21] Hannah were Hannah herself the purpose
[38:25] her desiring a child was not just that
[38:28] she would not be barren but within it
[38:30] she said I will give it unto you Lord
[38:33] that it will dwell in your house and I
[38:36] believe with all my heart that in
[38:38] dedication of children it come this is a
[38:40] reality that we realize that it is a
[38:43] continual working and an unfolding and
[38:47] an awesome responsibility that's given
[38:50] to us by God as parents things that we
[38:54] would want to do for them and love to
[38:57] give to them but yet there are things
[39:00] that God has given to us we can instruct
[39:02] we can teach we can nurture in the
[39:04] things of God but it takes the sovereign
[39:07] grace of God to bring them in to that
[39:10] life of which our words and our conduct
[39:14] and our home is to express of that land
[39:18] beyond the river but it takes Joshua it
[39:21] takes the grace of God to take them into
[39:23] that reality to see let us dedicate let
[39:27] us dedicate just as God himself dedicate
[39:31] you know God is dedicated to it to this
[39:33] working he who has brought us out of the
[39:35] world
[39:36] he moved within our life to bring us to
[39:39] himself you know he is dedicated to
[39:42] finishing what he started
[39:44] and when it comes to that moment of
[39:48] which you and I recognize more and more
[39:50] day by day it is the very grace of God
[39:54] not what we deserve
[39:57] your best day your greatest day all that
[40:00] you can do you still are not deserving
[40:03] of God's grace or else it's not grace
[40:05] yes by works but God's grace at that
[40:10] moment the sweep right in what we have
[40:13] been dedicated to all of these times
[40:16] here His grace will sweep in and take us
[40:19] home
[40:20] oh what a parallel we are the children
[40:24] of Abraham
[40:26] amen that that same name as Jacob said
[40:29] the same that name upon me that was upon
[40:32] Abraham that was upon Isaac that be upon
[40:34] them and I believe this morning his
[40:35] brother had him sister Beau would bring
[40:37] a little faith and we just want to pray
[40:39] just a prayer of dedication and that the
[40:43] Lord Himself would just watch over her
[40:46] life and guide them as parents direct
[40:49] them amen you love him
[42:07] we're within our
[42:53] [Applause]
[42:58] and then all the sisters you'll be able
[43:01] to see it after church if we could have
[43:04] just held it up here so you could have
[43:05] seen the face so your minds not
[43:08] wandering while the words coming forth
[43:11] she's beautiful just just trust me she's
[43:14] beautiful
[43:17] don't you love the Lord oh my thank you
[43:22] Lord Jesus
[43:25] oh my who the joy of the Lord is my
[43:30] strength say brother Sammy don't you
[43:32] ever get down oh you just don't know
[43:34] sure I get down sure I get discouraged
[43:37] sure there's things I can look at but I
[43:39] choose to look to him because he can't
[43:42] fail what he has said he is able to
[43:46] perform amen
[43:49] we're just so glad to have brother
[43:51] Timothy as Sean you're with us and we
[43:54] just are just so thankful I tell you
[43:56] what if you missed

[44:00] download it stream it if you were here
[44:03] listen to it again
[44:05] tremendous tremendous you know I tell
[44:09] you I don't believe I need to tell you
[44:10] as a church that God when different ones
[44:13] are coming through and how God will
[44:14] orchestrate all of these things you know
[44:17] it's something for you and I to say well
[44:20] God you're speaking to me the Lord speak
[44:23] to me you know it's one of those things
[44:26] it's just boy I'll tell you what I know
[44:29] that God is really speaking to our lives
[44:31] in our hearts and you know what God
[44:33] don't have to do that like that let me
[44:36] tell you something
[44:36] peanut butter is peanut butter it's like
[44:40] I told him in other places where I go
[44:41] and preach I said peanut butter is
[44:43] peanut butter if I put peanut butter on
[44:44] bread and give it to you it's the same
[44:46] as your pastor putting peanut butter on
[44:48] it and giving it to you I said but God
[44:50] has a way that God will change the
[44:52] vessel and sometimes it's the
[44:53] presentation of it
[44:57] he don't have to do that but he does
[44:59] that because he loves us and he cares us
[45:02] and to her you and I can realize you
[45:04] know what this individual this brother
[45:07] doesn't know one thing about me I don't
[45:11] discuss nothing with the ministers that
[45:13] come through here I don't discuss
[45:15] anything with them at all that is up to
[45:18] God I've been places and I don't want to
[45:21] hear stuff I just be honest with you I
[45:22] don't want to hear stuff about know
[45:24] where I go I don't want to get my hair
[45:25] stuff about other places because you
[45:26] know what every place has its troubles
[45:29] you look down through the New Testament
[45:31] find one of the letters where there's a
[45:34] perfect church there's only one perfect
[45:36] Church and is the Church of the Living
[45:38] God born by the Spirit of God into that
[45:42] body that's the one he's coming back
[45:44] after and that's who our eyes are upon
[45:46] him amen because look it's a situation

[54:21] portion of the scriptures this morning
[54:23] we try to read from Genesis chapter 5
[54:25] and just remind ourselves of some few
[54:30] things that which we have been taught
[54:35] that which has been given to us and we
[54:38] always want to remind ourselves because
[54:41] we don't want those things to slip out
[54:44] of our hands praise the Lord and then
[54:49] also we try to read from Hebrews chapter
[54:51] 11 Genesis chapter 5 they start from
[55:02] verse 1 this is the book of the
[55:09] generations of Adam in the day that God
[55:14] created man in the likeness of God made
[55:21] he him male and female created he them
[55:27] and called their name Adam in the day
[55:33] when they were created
[55:37] and I don't live 113 years and begot a
[55:41] son in his own likeness and after his
[55:45] image and called his name said and the
[55:51] days of Adam after he had begotten said
[55:55] were eight hundred years and he begat
[55:59] sons and daughters
[56:02] and all the days that I done lived with
[56:05] nine hundred and thirty years and he
[56:08] died let's jump and read from verse 18
[56:15] and Jared lived an hundred sixty and two
[56:24] years and he begat Enoch and you not
[56:29] leave after he begat Enoch eight hundred
[56:32] years and begat sons and daughters
[56:36] and all the days of Jared were nine
[56:41] hundred sixty and three years and II
[56:45] died and end up live 60 and five years
[56:51] and begot Methuselah and Enoch walked
[56:56] with God after he begot Methuselah three
[57:00] hundred years and begat sons and
[57:04] daughters
[57:04] and all the days of end up with three
[57:08] hundred sixty and five years and Enoch
[57:13] walked with God and he was not for God
[57:18] took him I mean let's read from Hebrews
[57:23] pushing from a bush chata 11
[57:34] hebrews chapter 11 this route was five
[57:39] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[57:45] should not see death and was not found
[57:48] because God had translated him for
[57:53] before his translation he had this
[57:55] testimony that he pleased God but
[58:01] without faith it is impossible to please
[58:03] him for he that cometh to God must
[58:06] believe that he is and that he is a
[58:10] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[58:14] Him may the Lord bless the reading of
[58:18] his only word Amen shall please be
[58:22] seated
[58:29] praise the Lord
[58:31] so our God is good he's always good a
[58:36] girl loves us and he cares for us our

[1:00:40] whoo hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus
[1:00:45] what a privilege people we are to be
[1:00:48] addressed by the king of having to be
[1:00:54] furthered by the king of heaven that a
[1:00:58] king of heaven will open our eyes to see
[1:01:02] that a king of every will call us to
[1:01:04] come to him coming to me or in dilemma
[1:01:08] and him elated I will give you rest the
[1:01:10] king of Amin has given us rest the king

[1:01:18] feminists piranhas
[1:01:23] yes set us free and we are free forever
[1:01:28] we are free forever because the King set

[1:01:34] the price of redemption he paid it and
[1:01:37] the King said go you are free you are
[1:01:44] free he paid your price imperative we
[1:01:48] are free we are normal as opposed to say
[1:01:53] he bought us say you go we are now where
[1:01:58] to glory and nothing can bring us back
[1:02:01] we have been loosing and we are free
[1:02:06] praise the Lord let us be this morning
[1:02:10] later on breaking the cycle by faith
[1:02:18] breaking the cycle by faith when we
[1:02:23] speak of a cycle say a cycle is a series
[1:02:27] of events operations that reoccur
[1:02:34] regularly and usually leads back to the
[1:02:40] starting point a series of events that
[1:02:46] may occur regularly and usually lives
[1:02:53] back to the starting point or to the
[1:02:56] beginning again a cycle like we we see
[1:03:03] the sunrise in the ish and it travels
[1:03:09] and it just the worst and then is back
[1:03:13] again it's a cycle just the same thing
[1:03:19] we are the cycle of time and you know
[1:03:23] it's from this it does it lets go it
[1:03:25] cycle
[1:03:28] and we have day and night we have a
[1:03:31] cycle of the week and the month and the
[1:03:35] year no new moon no new month is had it
[1:03:39] no new week none it is desert sensing
[1:03:45] Brazil or so we have these cycles in our
[1:03:49] life that are cycles that I promise that
[1:03:52] every civilian there is a cycle that is
[1:03:54] the change in our lives it's a cycle we
[1:04:01] woke up in the morning afternoon evening
[1:04:03] is a cycle we have the world at the time
[1:04:07] and and we have the summer and we are
[1:04:10] default and we know winter is coming and
[1:04:12] we show it's a cycle
[1:04:18] prison oh Jesus
[1:04:20] it's a cycle of time the recycle for the
[1:04:23] month and the year and our run us our
[1:04:30] God is so good
[1:04:31] and so you know this is going to be that
[1:04:34] going to be that gonna be how great is
[1:04:38] our God and so the scripture that tells
[1:04:41] us the generation of other in the day
[1:04:44] that God created me it's a man FEMA care
[1:04:48] that he then and blessed them and called
[1:04:51] their name Adam many of him a Democrat
[1:04:56] male and male he created male and female
[1:05:01] and that is God's other and he blessed
[1:05:07] them that is what God God did that in
[1:05:11] the beginning that is God's other male
[1:05:14] and female not Mel and Mel and similar
[1:05:18] theme and math and see me anything
[1:05:27] contrary to the Word of God is seen
[1:05:30] see this unbelief of God's Word
[1:05:34] she is to miss the matter and when we
[1:05:41] inject our thoughts and our feelings
[1:05:42] into God's Word
[1:05:44] he's become perfected it's number the
[1:05:46] Word of God it is Antichrist it is death
[1:05:53] and that breath the continuity of God to
[1:05:58] inject into what God says God don't need
[1:06:03] our addition or our subtraction we
[1:06:07] cannot make it better than what God has
[1:06:09] given to us we cannot make it holier
[1:06:16] than what God has given it's not bad our
[1:06:23] works of righteousness it is where God's
[1:06:25] grace salvation is of the Lord believe
[1:06:31] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
[1:06:34] be saved and we are perfect that in
[1:06:37] Christ Jesus or the blood that was shed
[1:06:41] for us
[1:06:41] Oh hallelujah or the Prophet once said
[1:06:48] and I said I used to think the babies
[1:06:51] are innocent
[1:06:54] it'sa but I came to realize we are more
[1:06:57] innocent than the babies because of the
[1:07:00] blood of Jesus
[1:07:05] can you think about it because of the
[1:07:08] blood of Jesus we are not innocent oh
[1:07:12] the babies the power of the blood of
[1:07:16] Jesus I was talking to Russia and like
[1:07:23] to see the snow and nothing whiter than
[1:07:28] the snow but we are the only ones that
[1:07:31] are whiter than the snow what's in the
[1:07:33] blood of Jesus and we become whiter than
[1:07:36] the snow as we don't realize who we
[1:07:47] are and what he has made us or if we can
[1:07:54] really recognize it even if we can
[1:07:57] really see it or whether we'll leave so
[1:08:01] high but because we don't realize these
[1:08:05] things that has been done for us that
[1:08:08] has been made for us we live below our
[1:08:11] privileges that's why we go about with
[1:08:16] front faces and we keep worrying here
[1:08:20] and there but he told us God had to see
[1:08:23] us worried
[1:08:25] going to see you happy going to see you
[1:08:29] rejoicing going to see you pressing on
[1:08:32] going to see you progressing
[1:08:34] we must progress in our Christian life
[1:08:40] because life is progressing when babies
[1:08:49] are born they don't remember is the girl
[1:08:51] we were once babies but we have blown
[1:08:54] and the same was spiritually we must
[1:08:57] blow
[1:09:01] because if you don't glow it becomes a
[1:09:04] problem
[1:09:05] he becomes an issue he becomes a bad day
[1:09:09] but we have to grow we are happy to see
[1:09:12] our children growing and maturing and
[1:09:16] God is happy to see in student growing
[1:09:19] and maturing you can stay in one place
[1:09:26] you gotta grow the promise that when
[1:09:31] they will ask you so when will your

[1:10:02] glorious and it gets better as the day

[1:10:10] somebody must break the cycle of
[1:10:13] unbelief you gotta break the cycle of

[2:51:46] seem good enough because God knows what
[2:51:50] we have need of you knows just how to
[2:51:53] come and to speak to our hearts and such
[2:51:55] a personal Lane you know one of the
[2:51:57] greatest blessings that we can have in
[2:51:59] this hour is to be able as the brother
[2:52:02] was preaching today it's to see it's me
[2:52:05] we live in an age that takes no
[2:52:07] responsibility the Spirit of this age
[2:52:10] deflects it upon everybody else it puts
[2:52:13] it that the reason that I am the way I
[2:52:15] am the reason I can't do the way I want
[2:52:17] to do is because of this person are
[2:52:19] there but think speed of God this is a
[2:52:22] part of living in the land whenever when
[2:52:25] the failure took place in the land
[2:52:27] Joshua did not look and say okay who's
[2:52:31] at fault but the first thing he did was
[2:52:34] in himself he humbled himself and
[2:52:37] prostrating himself before God you know
[2:52:41] what that was that was his heart for
[2:52:43] God's body his heart for the work of God
[2:52:46] aren't you glad that God gave you a
[2:52:49] heart like that who gave you a heart
[2:52:51] like how could that be
[2:52:52] we couldn't be we are selfish people it
[2:52:55] takes someone greater than us to move on
[2:52:58] the inside of us then that would even
[2:52:59] stir that up in our hearts for us to lay
[2:53:02] down our will no wonder like Paul we
[2:53:06] also can say I die daily amen don't you
[2:53:10] love the Lord Amen and I'm just so
[2:53:14] thankful to God as sister Chrissy here
[2:53:16] she is she's making a step and really
[2:53:19] the step that she's made is not so much
[2:53:21] as we've looked at it before of a person
[2:53:24] themselves per group moving as far as
[2:53:26] physically forward but it's our heart
[2:53:28] being touched by God and thus
[2:53:30] surrendering to his call you know the
[2:53:33] Lord began dealing with her heart
[2:53:35] her life just some months ago and and
[2:53:37] then here just a few weeks ago in the
[2:53:39] service and the presence of the Lord are

[2:53:45] were and what was being asked in the
[2:53:47] service is there anyone here who wants
[2:53:49] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:53:52] Jesus Christ I don't believe we're ever
[2:53:54] out of order within this but I look at
[2:53:57] it that this is the great call and still
[2:53:59] the fulfillment of the Great Commission
[2:54:01] that the same God that would touch her
[2:54:04] heart of where he has brought her
[2:54:05] throughout these months even into this
[2:54:08] place to know that that same God will
[2:54:10] take her the rest of the way you know
[2:54:12] how can you and I be receptive unless
[2:54:15] God Himself continues to work on our
[2:54:18] life that we would be receptive so we're
[2:54:21] gonna I want to ask you just to join
[2:54:23] with us in prayer that the Lord will
