[33:55] and
[33:58] amen so
[34:00] thankful Amen brother Brian
[34:02] musicians amen just a wonderful
[34:05] atmosphere that's been created here and
[34:08] just a wonderful time of worship Amen to
[34:11] know that that goes collectively
[34:13] together it's certainly just a an
[34:15] instrument alone we'll never do it but
[34:17] it's everything coming in harmony
[34:20] because truly if there was no
[34:21] instruments there's still an atmosphere
[34:24] that can come amen by that a Believer
[34:27] but I'm glad that God allowed us to have
[34:30] instruments amen and I'm so thankful for
[34:32] them so thankful for each and every one
[34:35] of you and uh it's just so refreshing
[34:38] many times I sat back there and I'm
[34:40] listening to the songs that are being
[34:41] sung and it's just um just really really
[34:45] tremendous so I want to look here in
[34:48] verse 13 uh and begin to read through
[34:51] this portion again of
[34:53] scripture and job says here but he is in
[34:57] one mind and who can turn him and what
[35:01] his soul desireth even that he doeth for
[35:05] he performeth the thing that is
[35:08] appointed for me and many such things
[35:11] are with him therefore am I troubled at
[35:16] his presence when I consider that word
[35:19] consider means to think and his
[35:22] perception on things when I consider I
[35:25] am afraid
[35:27] of him that to me that that that portion
[35:30] of scripture as we've looked at
[35:32] throughout to me it is just it just it
[35:35] just takes my My Breath Away almost
[35:38] because to see of how that job himself
[35:40] would have such perfect peace with the
[35:43] by the Revelation that God has given but
[35:46] how that the enemy is trying to project
[35:50] thoughts to him that would try to
[35:52] discomfort him and yet you know to me
[35:56] it's such a Paradox how a person can
[35:58] have such a rest and a peace in their
[36:00] soul and yet can be troubled in their
[36:05] mind
[36:07] amen but I'm glad I'm glad for God's
[36:10] mercy that he came down amen he who made
[36:13] a way that we could have that real peace
[36:15] in our soul and receive from there that
[36:18] which is able to bring everything else
[36:20] in
[36:21] subjection amen for God maketh my heart
[36:24] soft and the almighty troubleth me
[36:27] because I was not cut off before the
[36:29] darkness neither hath he covered the
[36:33] darkness from my face and may God bless
[36:36] you and bless the reading of the word as
[36:37] you're being
[36:38] seated I'd just like to begin to speak
[36:41] to you here tonight and I certainly
[36:43] didn't um know or was not even looking
[36:47] at it in that way some months ago when
[36:50] this thought had struck me within
[36:53] looking at Job 23 and uh how it is many
[36:57] times you just don't know whether or not
[36:59] is it going to be something and how when
[37:02] that the Lord will place it but I want
[37:04] to just begin to speak here on the
[37:05] thought drawn from here why should I
[37:10] worry why should I
[37:14] worry and when we look at we've been
[37:17] looking at that thought on having a
[37:19] right perception and obviously we would
[37:22] know that anytime that we have the wrong
[37:25] perception
[37:27] then that in itself will actually affect
[37:30] us in certain ways and we've looked at
[37:32] that with job job himself he is not
[37:36] aware in the sense or not he doesn't
[37:39] understand what's taking place God
[37:40] hasn't let him know uh that of what had
[37:43] taken place in heaven that God was
[37:46] actually the one that was bragging on
[37:47] him and so job doesn't know this but but
[37:51] job his perception of it is that it's
[37:54] God that is doing all of this to him and
[37:57] yet to see how close that that could be
[37:59] is that the prophet would tell us that
[38:02] as long as Satan could make job think
[38:06] that it was his God that was doing this
[38:09] to him he had him whipped and then
[38:12] brother brand would go on to say he says
[38:14] and he will do the same thing to you
[38:17] today he wants to make you think that it
[38:20] is God that is doing it now you know
[38:23] many of us would look at that and think
[38:25] well we understand that you know that in
[38:27] the sense that we we have a more of an
[38:31] understanding by the word to know that
[38:33] it's not anything that God himself was
[38:36] doing it was God permitting and it was
[38:39] Satan that was doing it and when we can
[38:41] realize and look back into these things
[38:43] which job did not realize or think of
[38:47] know the conversation that was in heaven
[38:49] but think about it Satan knew there was
[38:51] a hedge around job's life he knew there
[38:54] was a protection and he even told God
[38:56] God he says I can't get to him unless
[38:59] that hedge you move a little bit and God
[39:02] would give him permissions to encroach
[39:04] and that's the same way it is with any
[39:06] test or trial that comes our way even
[39:09] sickness that Satan just cannot come and
[39:12] do what he wants to do when he feels
[39:14] like doing it no he has to first get
[39:17] permission from God and so we realize
[39:20] that within many of these things as we
[39:23] would look at it that job himself would
[39:26] not have the right perception on it and
[39:29] that would affect him we read through
[39:30] many different scriptures as we would go
[39:32] through it and job you know looking at
[39:34] his own life he knew where he was
[39:36] standing with God he knew that there was
[39:39] nothing that God had asked him to do but
[39:42] what he didn't do it job job knew that I
[39:45] think it's to me it's such a powerful
[39:47] message that the prophet would preach
[39:49] and I went through it over and over
[39:50] again I have heard but now I see and he
[39:52] spends that time upon job of how that we
[39:55] in our lives for anything that we're
[39:57] asking of God he says we must have the
[40:00] assurance that we are justified in what
[40:03] we're asking for that we're standing
[40:06] where we ought to be standing in God and
[40:10] that everything between us and God is
[40:12] just lined up perfectly then we've got a
[40:15] right to claim the promise we have a
[40:17] right to go and take our petitions
[40:19] before God and make that known we are
[40:22] justified in the thing that we're asking
[40:25] and we can look for answer I I think to
[40:27] me it's fitting in the hour that we're
[40:29] living in because of how the Book of Job
[40:32] so portrays even that of redemption
[40:35] throughout but that of perception you
[40:37] and I both know that we have had the
[40:39] wrong perceptions of things in different
[40:42] times and and uh it has affected us it
[40:45] can affect us in our actions toward
[40:47] others and just our perception or our
[40:50] thoughts of things it'd be just like if
[40:52] you let's say you were talking to
[40:53] somebody and they never seemingly made
[40:56] eye contact with you and maybe they
[40:58] didn't you know when you were talking
[41:00] they didn't smile or anything the
[41:01] thought could hit your mind that they
[41:03] really don't care about what I'm talking
[41:05] about they really don't want nothing to
[41:07] do with me and you'll find that when we
[41:10] begin to dwell on things like that it
[41:12] will actually affect our Behavior now I
[41:16] can't even go into all of this tonight
[41:18] because there's actual quotes to show
[41:20] this and portions within the scripture
[41:22] even when Abraham remember him going
[41:24] down to Egypt why did Abraham do what he
[41:27] did by calling teing telling Sarah you
[41:29] tell them that you're my sister why did
[41:32] he do that did he go up and ask anybody
[41:34] hey how should I enter this place no he
[41:36] said because I thought that the fear of
[41:41] God wasn't in this place boy was he
[41:43] wrong that's good that King actually
[41:45] feared God to the degree that he could
[41:48] know God he actually feared God remember
[41:52] it was God when the king went and God
[41:54] came to him in a dream and here the Lord
[41:56] came to him and said he said Lord you
[41:58] know I I it wasn't in my heart to do
[42:00] this he said I know the Integrity of
[42:03] your heart he was not even elect he was
[42:05] not even elect seed of God but God knew
[42:08] the Integrity of a righteous man so
[42:12] sometimes the perceptions itself can be
[42:14] so off and there is effects of those
[42:17] perceptions none of us are exempt from
[42:19] it it does not matter who you are what
[42:22] we are we're not exempt from wrong
[42:24] perceptions that's why we need the grace
[42:27] of God continually in our lives and when
[42:30] so when we look at this and you'll maybe
[42:32] see where I'm drawing this from out of
[42:34] the message I've heard but now I see
[42:36] brother BR said job had something wrong
[42:38] with him but he couldn't get the
[42:41] inspiration on him now remember he's a
[42:42] prophet and it was worrying
[42:47] him and notice when you get in that kind
[42:51] of a fix in other words when things
[42:55] aren't coming the way you're used to
[42:57] them coming and the way that they should
[43:00] be coming and then you start to worry
[43:04] you're in a fix how many's been there
[43:07] right that's when the enemy moves into
[43:11] every friend nearly you
[43:14] got now let me just say it like this it
[43:17] doesn't necessarily mean that you're
[43:19] going to have friends that maybe would
[43:20] be you know like job's friends or but
[43:23] you know notice how sometimes where the
[43:25] enemy will come in and you can find
[43:27] certain things that will rise up such
[43:30] negativity that can get around there and
[43:32] you could think can I get one quotation
[43:35] of a promise in a positive
[43:38] way right can I can somebody at least
[43:41] send me a text message can somebody at
[43:43] least text bomb me with a few positive
[43:47] messages and do you know sometimes that
[43:49] a person coming around may not intend to
[43:52] be negative maybe they're prone to that
[43:54] way in their makeup you know and things
[43:56] like that such as you have a cough oh I
[43:58] know a person that had a cough like that
[44:00] better get your coughing ready because
[44:02] they're going to be bearing you tomorrow
[44:04] you know you always you look at things
[44:06] like that and we're tested in that way
[44:08] cuz we're all made up differently you
[44:10] know that's the one thing that's
[44:11] powerful is that God just did not send
[44:14] the Holy Ghost to change necessarily our
[44:17] temperament but that he would live and
[44:19] operate through Us and how that God
[44:22] would give us the grace to actually live
[44:25] Victorious even over those things in our
[44:27] life and tendencies but notice this
[44:30] every enemy moves into every friend
[44:32] nearly you God and they begin to accuse
[44:34] him oh it must have been a miserable
[44:37] thing for him to know his friends that
[44:40] accused him Satan then goes and joins
[44:43] himself with the Enemy now remember it
[44:46] wasn't just his buddies that were around
[44:48] him his wife the Bible says how that she
[44:51] turned and said why don't you just Curse
[44:54] God and die
[44:56] even through the course of the trial job
[44:58] said our breath is strange to one
[45:01] another I don't have to preach too deep
[45:02] on that you can figure that out there
[45:04] were effects from this trial and how
[45:07] that it had upon his life even to where
[45:10] the maids that was in his house job
[45:12] would speak of it there was no such
[45:14] thing as even the maids themselves were
[45:16] turning their back on job oh my what a
[45:20] what a time what a situation he was in
[45:23] but God had confidence in his word in
[45:27] his son he had confidence in job's life
[45:30] now watch this then Satan comes in and
[45:33] Satan says let me have him I'll make him
[45:35] curse you I'll make him deny his message
[45:39] I'll make him curse you I'll make him go
[45:41] back and say it was all wrong then he
[45:44] tried with everything he could to all
[45:47] the great man and the friends that he
[45:49] used to have but job stood flat-footed
[45:52] for he knew he had heard God's voice
[45:57] now this term of worry when you think of
[45:59] it why should I worry the wor word worry
[46:02] it means to give away to anxiety or
[46:05] unease to allow one's mind to dwell on
[46:09] difficulty or troubles to cause
[46:12] annoyance to or to cause to feel anxiety
[46:16] or concern now I'm sure every one of us
[46:19] at some point in time or another and if
[46:21] God carries not only have we worried
[46:24] about things but there will be things
[46:26] come along that we will also worry about
[46:30] now I'm not saying that in a way that we
[46:32] would all you know turn the pews to a
[46:33] circle join hands and sing Kumbaya we're
[46:36] nothing but a bunch of worry wordss
[46:38] that's not what I'm saying what I'm
[46:40] saying is is that the Frailty of our
[46:42] Humanity we will never Escape worries
[46:46] from coming but there is an answer for
[46:50] every worry that comes our way yes sir
[46:53] that's what I love about the Lord that
[46:55] when you go when God gets a hold of your
[46:57] life it's not a picnic you've entered
[46:59] into a Battleground as a matter of fact
[47:01] brother R said when you say you've
[47:03] received the Holy Ghost he said then he
[47:05] said every gun out of hell is trained on
[47:09] you you've got a Target on your back but
[47:12] he says remember you've got greater is
[47:15] he that's in you than he that's in the
[47:17] world what does that do well if I would
[47:20] just leave that quote in that way it
[47:22] could almost be put you in a state of
[47:24] worry but see the word does never leave
[47:27] you in a state of worry you understand
[47:29] what I'm saying the word never puts you
[47:32] in a state of worry the word will always
[47:35] work to settle you and if you're not
[47:38] settled it will point you to a place of
[47:42] settling in your life because the whole
[47:45] goal of the Gospel is rest is peace is
[47:49] to dwell in that Perfection of
[47:52] God so why should I worry
[47:58] my what a time to be talking about this
[48:00] in this age that's
[48:03] right I'm sure every one of us have been
[48:05] like that like job where there's been
[48:08] certain things even as much as we know
[48:10] and understand and how that this would
[48:13] be laid out in the message of the hour
[48:15] the scriptures showing us how that God
[48:17] would work with us as Sons and Daughters
[48:19] of God but how many of us still within
[48:22] when things take place in our life we
[48:24] look at it sometimes in a manner of
[48:26] what's taking place what's going on but
[48:29] aren't you glad that God the holy spirit
[48:31] will come back around and remind you of
[48:34] his
[48:36] word I'm so glad about that now watch
[48:39] this in the message the way to have
[48:40] Fellowship brother BR says there's only
[48:43] two faculties that govern a human and
[48:46] one of them is Faith which brings
[48:48] results and the other is fear which has
[48:51] no value in it at all faith is of God
[48:55] fear is of the devil fear Makes You
[48:59] Weary or you could say worry fear makes
[49:02] you wonder and if I was going to die in
[49:05] the morning what good would it do to me
[49:07] to get all stewed up about it what if I
[49:10] was going to be electrocuted in the
[49:11] morning and my life had to end tomorrow
[49:14] morning what good would it do me to
[49:17] worry about
[49:20] it I know this is simple but the prophet
[49:23] he's pointing out the very principle
[49:25] love looking at things if we can look at
[49:28] him this way he's helping us to
[49:30] understand there are things that you you
[49:33] and I need to consider but it must have
[49:36] value in it and value is something that
[49:40] speaks of the real gold that's in your
[49:43] life something that will bring value you
[49:45] realize that's how you're to evaluate
[49:48] everything in your life with the Holy
[49:50] Spirit in your life that's how you
[49:52] evaluate the things you partake in
[49:55] that's how you evaluate your Associates
[49:58] you look at it in terms of value it's
[50:01] not just about you but it's about in
[50:04] this situation of is there a value or
[50:07] something mutually it would flow and
[50:09] there would be an increase in our life I
[50:11] don't want to be a part of things that
[50:13] devalue and want to take from me the
[50:16] things that God is instilling in me this
[50:19] is why brother Ram says he tells us as
[50:22] ministers he says you watch he said on
[50:24] Monday morning how that Satan will come
[50:26] against that Minister I believe it's
[50:28] every one of us you come out of a good
[50:30] service whether it's Friday morning
[50:32] Monday morning and he said watch how
[50:34] Satan will come and try to knock every
[50:36] ounce of confidence that God has
[50:39] instilled in your life and that's what
[50:42] that's what Satan that's his trick to
[50:44] try to knock that out because with that
[50:46] confidence well where did you get that
[50:48] confidence from you didn't get the
[50:50] confidence from the music You Got The
[50:52] Confidence from an unseen realm the
[50:54] supernatural begin to roll down out of
[50:57] an unseen realm the Revelation begin to
[51:00] break forth and God was speaking so
[51:02] personally to your life that it actually
[51:05] gave you confidence to face the problems
[51:08] that are before you Hallelujah two
[51:11] faculties that govern a human let me
[51:13] read that again the other is fear which
[51:15] has no value in it faith is of god fear
[51:18] is of the devil fear Makes You Weary
[51:21] fear makes you wonder if we could just
[51:24] stop right there tonight
[51:25] right there there right right within
[51:27] that portion it gives enough to discern
[51:30] the thoughts that come to
[51:32] you if a thought comes to you and wants
[51:35] to bring fear that didn't come from
[51:38] God the thoughts of God his word comes
[51:41] to bring Faith is that right oh brother
[51:45] Samuel I heard a certain quote presented
[51:47] a certain way I heard a certain
[51:48] Scripture presented a certain way well
[51:50] sure there's things sometimes that that
[51:52] can be presented in a way but remember
[51:55] remember when God presents his word his
[51:58] word does not come to belittle you put
[52:00] you down or rub your face in the dirt
[52:03] that is not of God it could have been
[52:06] quoting the Scripture it could be
[52:08] quoting a quote but it matters the
[52:11] spirit that's behind
[52:13] it is that all right yes sir so now
[52:17] notice he goes on to say in the next
[52:19] portion of that quote he said well you
[52:21] say what good would it do me to have
[52:23] faith faith can sign my
[52:25] there's value in faith don't be weary
[52:29] don't be scared don't be upset just have
[52:32] faith and believe and the only way you
[52:35] can have faith you have to have love
[52:37] first for love produces Faith
[52:42] Lord this is one thing I I love all the
[52:45] way through the message of the hour it
[52:47] just don't only tell us don't do this
[52:50] don't do that but there here's the
[52:53] remedy right I mean it's sees you don't
[52:56] do this and you're wrong and you're
[52:57] wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong
[52:58] and you're wrong and you're wrong
[52:59] anybody right besides you I mean is
[53:02] anybody right don't do don't do don't do
[53:04] don't do but see look what the message
[53:06] of the hour it comes to show you and I
[53:09] it shows us you don't have to do this
[53:12] but here here it is something you can
[53:14] just say okay well I'll just flip the
[53:15] switch off okay where's that switch of
[53:17] worry at I'll just there it is it's off
[53:19] it's off right now no the only way that
[53:22] worry is overcome is you've got a focus
[53:25] on the right
[53:28] thing Hallelujah is that right now watch
[53:30] 1 John 4:17 hear in is our love made
[53:37] perfect I love
[53:39] that herein is our love made perfect you
[53:43] know what that scripture tells me that
[53:45] there's more of the love of God
[53:48] Amen that's what that tells me that
[53:50] there is continual fillings of the Holy
[53:54] Ghost it tells me not just feelings of
[53:56] it but that more and more and more of
[53:59] God's love in our life is that right
[54:03] this is why when you evaluate you read
[54:05] down through 1 Corinthians 13 and you
[54:07] and sometimes if you read through there
[54:09] and something catches you you and the
[54:10] spirit of God deals with your heart
[54:12] listen it isn't don't don't begin to
[54:14] pray and say Lord I I I I shouldn't feel
[54:16] that way towards this one or I shouldn't
[54:18] know what you need to realize is this is
[54:20] what's happening I need more lord of the
[54:23] love of God Amen because that is the
[54:26] answer is that right we don't want to
[54:28] just put out little fires let's get to
[54:30] the source of the matter what's going to
[54:32] give us the strength amen herein is our
[54:34] love made perfect that we may have
[54:37] boldness confidence in the day of
[54:38] judgment because as he is so are we in
[54:42] this world in verse 18 there is no fear
[54:46] in love but perfect love casteth out
[54:50] fear aren't you glad about that it's
[54:53] like as I've described it before it's
[54:55] kind of like that whacka game that would
[54:57] be at the fairgrounds or whatever more
[54:59] and you taking that and it popping up
[55:00] out of this hole and you got to pow put
[55:02] it down there it pops up here you put it
[55:04] down there all around us fears and
[55:07] worries can come from many different
[55:10] events but just because fears and
[55:12] worries come and you feel it you don't
[55:15] have to occupy it and neither do you
[55:18] have to sit there under condemnation
[55:20] because you have felt that way you have
[55:23] a strength on the inside of the love of
[55:27] God to whack put it back in its place
[55:29] whack put it back in its place whack put
[55:32] it back in its
[55:33] place yes sir yeah because fear hath
[55:39] torment and he that feareth is not made
[55:43] perfect in love so the real love of God
[55:47] brings
[55:49] rest it brings a rest in the sense that
[55:52] I know in whom I have believed I am
[55:54] resting in the work that he's done in my
[55:57] life but it doesn't mean that worries
[55:59] and fears can't come around
[56:02] you you hear me now watch this you see
[56:05] God has made such a provision by his
[56:08] word to be able to work and and and and
[56:12] push back and give man Grace over scares
[56:15] and over fears and over worry brother
[56:17] brand would say like this in the way to
[56:19] have Fellowship he said I know that if
[56:21] you can get away from that scare and get
[56:24] love in its place something's going to
[56:28] happen right so you have to get away
[56:31] from the scare and once you get away
[56:33] from the scare then God God begins to
[56:36] put something in its place I want more
[56:39] of his
[56:40] love I want more whatever your worries
[56:43] is tonight whatever is on your mind it
[56:45] might not even be something that's there
[56:47] in the Forefront before you but whatever
[56:50] it is I say God I want to get away from
[56:53] anything anything thing that is unlike
[56:56] you I want to get away from all of my
[56:58] worries because I cannot solve one
[57:02] problem on my own none I've never solved
[57:07] one problem my own well brother Samuel I
[57:09] prayed and I fasted that wasn't you
[57:11] solving the problem that was God in his
[57:15] Mercy that led you to pray LED you to
[57:18] fast but it was not because of your
[57:20] efforts that did
[57:22] it will God honor prayer yes will God H
[57:25] her honor fasting yes but it's to
[57:28] understand it's all in God's
[57:31] sovereignty why do you say that because
[57:33] you might be praying and fasting and
[57:35] you're not getting the answer like you
[57:36] had normally
[57:39] got and that's where you can begin to
[57:43] worry is that right now watch in the
[57:46] message of
[57:47] Love brother BR says it like this this
[57:50] is just the Simplicity of Love here
[57:52] Peter said repent every one of you be
[57:55] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[57:57] the remission of sins and you shall
[57:59] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[58:01] promises to you and your children to
[58:03] them a far off even as many as the Lord
[58:06] Our God shall call amen Lord that means
[58:10] me that settles it
[58:13] allall there's no Mayes remember when
[58:15] Paul said when he said the gospel that
[58:17] we have preached it was not yay and nay
[58:20] and well you can have this and I don't
[58:21] know about that but it was all yay and
[58:24] amen
[58:25] in
[58:26] him is that
[58:28] right now notice brother bam goes on and
[58:31] says anything God says oh you just love
[58:35] him so much you believe it brother B
[58:38] said oh I feel religious now to think
[58:41] that perfect love cast out all fear
[58:44] you're not scared about nothing you're
[58:46] just resting you're not oh I may
[58:49] backslide tomorrow I may backslide next
[58:53] week I want worry about
[58:58] that see Satan would love for your mind
[59:02] to begin to think about that well I
[59:04] might this and I might this and I know
[59:06] so and so did this and I know so who
[59:08] cares it's about you and God it's God
[59:12] who spoke to you personally somebody
[59:15] else's experience their life their walk
[59:18] is not the definition for you it's
[59:21] between you and
[59:23] God come on friends that's why the enemy
[59:27] that's why the prophet tells us in
[59:29] greatest battle or fought he said I
[59:31] don't care if I prayed for 10,000 and
[59:34] they all fell dead I'd stand at the
[59:36] platform the next night and challenge
[59:39] the devil and pray for another
[59:42] 10,000 why because it isn't the outcome
[59:46] it is God gave his
[59:51] word God gave his word and God can not
[59:55] fail amen and perfect love it cast out
[59:59] all
[59:59] fear oh glory be to God this is why oh
[1:00:04] brother brandham he goes on to talk
[1:00:06] about that oh I know so and so had this
[1:00:09] disease I know so and so had this and I
[1:00:12] know they professed this and I know they
[1:00:15] they did this an amazing the devil knows
[1:00:18] how to quote all the
[1:00:20] negative he knows how to bring up
[1:00:23] everything along along the
[1:00:25] way and he his his objective is to get
[1:00:29] your
[1:00:31] mind oh you better be careful because
[1:00:34] I'll tell you I known of Believers and I
[1:00:37] known where's that coming
[1:00:39] from listen friends if there's anything
[1:00:42] that should dominate the house house of
[1:00:44] God anything that should dominate our
[1:00:46] lives should be the love of
[1:00:48] God this is why this is why God's grace
[1:00:51] comes to free us from slave slavish
[1:00:56] fear you know what you know what slavish
[1:00:59] fear is brought by traditions of man
[1:01:02] that elevate self
[1:01:04] self-righteousness rather than the
[1:01:06] righteousness of almighty
[1:01:09] God that's right hallu my my my I won't
[1:01:14] worry about that I'm not trying to hold
[1:01:17] on he held on for me he put a love in my
[1:01:21] heart that holds there there you go it's
[1:01:24] him holding me not me holding him if he
[1:01:29] if it was me holding him I'd probably
[1:01:31] turn loose but as long as he's holding
[1:01:34] me he will never turn loose he promised
[1:01:38] he
[1:01:39] wouldn't I'll never leave thee nor
[1:01:41] forsake thee Oh my he that heareth my
[1:01:44] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:01:46] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:01:48] into condemnation but passed from Death
[1:01:52] unto life amen now in Matthew 6:25 the
[1:01:57] Lord Jesus would take many verses of
[1:01:59] scripture and I'm just going to pull a
[1:02:01] couple from here and we look at it
[1:02:03] tonight where he would
[1:02:05] admonish the Believers not just those
[1:02:09] disciples that were with him at the time
[1:02:11] of the Jews but remember he would Remish
[1:02:14] them because you know when he says for
[1:02:16] these things the Gentiles seeks the Lord
[1:02:18] Jesus never said in Matthew for these
[1:02:20] things the Jews
[1:02:22] seek you know why because we Gentiles
[1:02:25] were unaware of the covenants and the
[1:02:28] promises even though by by a hidden
[1:02:32] Mystery we were in at the whole
[1:02:35] time yes sir but you see for the Jews it
[1:02:37] was made known if you just put me first
[1:02:40] you serve me don't worry you don't have
[1:02:42] to go out here and fret and worry about
[1:02:44] this and worry about that you just put
[1:02:46] me first you serve me I'll take care of
[1:02:49] everything else for you is that right is
[1:02:52] that the scripture Deuteronomy 28
[1:02:54] Leviticus 26 on and on God promised he
[1:02:57] would do
[1:03:00] that I know some of you thinking I don't
[1:03:03] know I'm a little bit worried about
[1:03:06] that Matthew 6:25 therefore I say unto
[1:03:10] you take no thought this word is dealing
[1:03:13] with anxious care for your life what you
[1:03:16] shall eat what you shall drink nor yet
[1:03:19] for your body what get you shall put on
[1:03:22] is not the life more than the meat and
[1:03:23] the body than rayment now the Lord Jesus
[1:03:26] is not saying don't even think about
[1:03:27] what you're going to eat don't think
[1:03:28] about what you're going to wear he's not
[1:03:30] saying that he's saying do not become
[1:03:34] worrisome in the place or tied up to
[1:03:37] where
[1:03:38] everything becomes anxious dwelling on
[1:03:43] this sir life itself life itself Beyond
[1:03:48] clothing Beyond food Beyond shelter on
[1:03:51] and on there are things that can be
[1:03:54] become
[1:03:56] worrisome is that
[1:03:59] right verse 34 jumping on down there he
[1:04:02] says take therefore no thought for the
[1:04:05] tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take
[1:04:08] thought for the things of itself
[1:04:10] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:04:12] thereof now probably everybody in here
[1:04:15] who's a bridge builder would say Amen
[1:04:17] Lord so be it Lord I'm going to send
[1:04:20] back all the bridge building material
[1:04:22] that I have ordered from Lowe's and they
[1:04:24] it in my yard cuz I've already built
[1:04:25] this bridge Lord for this situation at
[1:04:28] work I've already built this bridge and
[1:04:30] I'm going to say this and they're going
[1:04:31] to say this and they're going to do this
[1:04:32] and they're going to do this
[1:04:36] and right what is that
[1:04:40] worry is that right watch this verse 34
[1:04:44] so do not same same verse but let me
[1:04:47] read it so do not worry or be anxious
[1:04:49] about tomorrow for tomorrow will have
[1:04:52] worries and anxiety ities of its own
[1:04:56] will sufficient for each day is its own
[1:05:01] trouble oh but brother Samuel you you
[1:05:03] know the Bible says a prudent man
[1:05:05] foresee well off that's true in the
[1:05:09] context of this word we operate like our
[1:05:12] heavenly father he never brought forth
[1:05:15] day two before day
[1:05:18] one everything that God does today is
[1:05:23] making way to sustain what's coming on
[1:05:26] tomorrow do you realize even things that
[1:05:29] you are praying about maybe it's healing
[1:05:31] in your body maybe it's Deliverance do
[1:05:33] you realize God just does not give that
[1:05:36] and just say well here it is but he
[1:05:38] works to build our faith not just that
[1:05:41] it would be lifted but that there would
[1:05:43] be faith that when it has been lifted
[1:05:46] there is Faith when it wants to come
[1:05:48] back and say not welcome
[1:05:51] here is that right
[1:05:55] Oh My My My I just read that today of
[1:05:58] how brother bam talked about how one
[1:06:00] that was blind she came through the line
[1:06:02] they prayed for her oh she went
[1:06:04] rejoicing started speaking in another
[1:06:06] tongue in German and here she came right
[1:06:08] in just a moments the blindness right
[1:06:10] back on her that Spirit was on her again
[1:06:12] they cast it off again she came right
[1:06:14] right then and there the way brother Ram
[1:06:15] describes it but it came back on again
[1:06:18] you see it's got to be the faith that's
[1:06:20] there to withstand it oh I say Lord
[1:06:24] help us not to get impatient God knows
[1:06:27] what he's doing because listen God wants
[1:06:30] you and I as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:32] to stand with faith on his word that
[1:06:34] where when the Devil comes up like the
[1:06:36] big bad wolf and wants to blow his hot
[1:06:39] breath upon you and I were able to stand
[1:06:42] there without a worry and say but my
[1:06:45] father said so and I am a partaker of
[1:06:49] this word and there is a token you
[1:06:52] cannot step one one more foot on this
[1:06:55] ground that's
[1:06:58] right the message why you were made to
[1:07:03] be happy and
[1:07:06] free you were made to live like children
[1:07:10] before your father and know that he
[1:07:14] makes every day everything work right
[1:07:18] for each
[1:07:20] day so there'll be problems there'll be
[1:07:23] trouble there'll be things
[1:07:25] tomorrow but what good does it do me to
[1:07:27] sit here tonight and worry if I'm going
[1:07:30] to get caught in traffic
[1:07:33] tomorrow what good does it worry do me
[1:07:35] to sit here and say boy I hope they have
[1:07:37] that favorite cereal in
[1:07:39] stock or at least if it's at the store
[1:07:42] they put it on the shelves what good
[1:07:43] does it do oh I I hope I tell you and
[1:07:47] isin it funny how the enemy will drop
[1:07:50] certain things on you when you're
[1:07:51] getting ready to come to church to get
[1:07:53] your mind wondering you can be cleared
[1:07:56] down the block two lights
[1:07:59] down all the
[1:08:01] time that's right I wonder if the
[1:08:04] curling iron still on now you know the
[1:08:06] curling iron ain't for
[1:08:07] me I I wonder if the stove still on I
[1:08:10] want ain't it funny how those thoughts
[1:08:12] can come now come on every one of us
[1:08:15] have been guilty of that and it's not so
[1:08:17] much guilty nothing wrong because you
[1:08:19] know what there's a part of it we we
[1:08:21] already have come in a place to realize
[1:08:23] you know what I I may I may walk in late
[1:08:25] to service but I am not going to let
[1:08:27] that devil torment me on this right here
[1:08:30] so I'll go ahead and I'll go back home
[1:08:31] and I'll double check it because I'm
[1:08:33] going to the house of God and I'm not
[1:08:36] going to sit there like an empty shell
[1:08:38] and worry about things that might be
[1:08:41] here or might be there I am going to go
[1:08:44] and draw strength from
[1:08:49] elshad Ephesians 1:3 see when we're
[1:08:52] talking about getting scar out getting
[1:08:55] fear out getting worry out there's no
[1:08:58] greater antidote than the word of
[1:09:00] almighty God then to be able to
[1:09:02] recognize that you and I it is not you
[1:09:04] and I that has the control of our
[1:09:05] destiny you might say well his brother
[1:09:07] well brother brother Samuel he can't be
[1:09:09] pulling us along and pushing us through
[1:09:11] no but remember this is a drama that's
[1:09:13] already been acted out God never came
[1:09:16] down to earth hoping that if he came and
[1:09:19] shed his blood that there would be some
[1:09:21] people who might feel sorry for him you
[1:09:24] know like the movie the passion and feel
[1:09:26] sorry for just a measure of time and
[1:09:29] then take back up their old habits and
[1:09:31] going everything else no that is not
[1:09:33] what Calvary was about Calvary where was
[1:09:36] God himself came down and made provision
[1:09:40] that there could come a creative blood
[1:09:42] and by the humanity of God becoming one
[1:09:45] of us he could carry the pretu that was
[1:09:49] needed for you and I to release the Holy
[1:09:52] Ghost back into our lives that would
[1:09:55] bring an
[1:10:05] assurance now you know sometimes when
[1:10:07] we're going somewhere in the car and I
[1:10:09] we're on a trip or somewhere sometimes
[1:10:12] when we're on there and I'm looking at
[1:10:13] it and there's a destiny let's say it's
[1:10:16] a destiny maybe we're going to bluon
[1:10:18] maybe we're going down to Jeffersonville
[1:10:19] and I we've got that locked in and it
[1:10:21] tells me what time you're going to
[1:10:22] arrive well I know where my Destiny's at
[1:10:24] I know where I'm going but sometimes
[1:10:26] along the way I get a a need for an
[1:10:30] Americano I get a need for a coffee so I
[1:10:32] add a stop in there and that stop that I
[1:10:35] start evaluating Kim find out how far
[1:10:37] this is off find how far this off is off
[1:10:39] find where this is at see see where this
[1:10:41] is at and you know and you're looking
[1:10:43] now listen when I stop there to get a
[1:10:45] coffee that's not my destination it's
[1:10:48] just a stop along the way there's a lot
[1:10:50] of stops that we can have along the way
[1:10:54] sometimes when you're traveling with
[1:10:55] people there's unplanned
[1:10:57] stops is that right you stop this one
[1:11:00] you stop with this oh wait wait wait
[1:11:02] wait wait wait we passed up that rest
[1:11:03] area can we go back and stop at that I
[1:11:05] mean you keep on stopping stopping
[1:11:06] stopping stop but there's a lot of stops
[1:11:08] but still it doesn't change the destiny
[1:11:11] right so no matter how many stops you've
[1:11:13] had your destiny is
[1:11:17] unaltered I don't care how many hiccups
[1:11:19] you've had in a journey I don't care how
[1:11:20] many failures you've had your destiny is
[1:11:23] is
[1:11:24] unaltered you say how can that be cuz
[1:11:27] you cannot add or take away from the
[1:11:30] word of God and that's what real
[1:11:33] predestination brings in view that I was
[1:11:36] always a part of
[1:11:40] God oh my my my my oh brother Samuel if
[1:11:45] you're preaching like that people are
[1:11:46] going to get loose that's called
[1:11:49] worry ungodly worry and that very thing
[1:11:54] like that has caused people to go clear
[1:11:56] to the opposite way and preach in
[1:12:01] it you think good Lord can anybody make
[1:12:07] it aren't you glad for the Holy
[1:12:10] Ghost aren't you glad for the real Grace
[1:12:12] of almighty
[1:12:15] God my I'm a little head right now but
[1:12:18] Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and
[1:12:21] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[1:12:24] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:12:26] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[1:12:29] as he hath chosen Us in him before the
[1:12:33] foundation of the world that we should
[1:12:35] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:12:39] love I'm glad it's this right here this
[1:12:41] choosing I'm glad it's not like it was
[1:12:43] when I was in elementary school and they
[1:12:44] lined us up against the wall all right
[1:12:46] count off by twos you know how this
[1:12:48] you're looking that guy can't kick
[1:12:52] it
[1:12:54] you know what I'm talking
[1:12:56] about that ain't what this choosing is
[1:12:58] this choosing took place before the
[1:13:01] foundation of the world we were always
[1:13:05] his we were in the loins of God's mind
[1:13:08] transferred down into the loins of
[1:13:12] Jesus come on
[1:13:14] now woo having predestinated us unto the
[1:13:19] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:13:21] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:13:23] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:13:26] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:13:29] accepted in the Beloved brother says an
[1:13:32] angel of the Covenant one night this
[1:13:34] week the Lord willing I want to speak on
[1:13:36] God's unconditional Covenant perhaps he
[1:13:39] said tomorrow night you know it's it's
[1:13:41] nothing but just to build the faith of
[1:13:43] the people just to get them buil up to a
[1:13:46] place where it gets all the scare away
[1:13:50] from them and we're trying our best to
[1:13:52] do it
[1:13:54] now I want to ask you to raise your
[1:13:56] hands but probably there is probably
[1:13:58] still individuals here that are afraid
[1:14:00] of the
[1:14:01] dark I won't call no names either that's
[1:14:05] right but every one of us I am
[1:14:08] grateful especially when I'm in strange
[1:14:11] places I'm grateful that I know where
[1:14:13] the light switch is
[1:14:15] at because I don't want to stumble over
[1:14:17] certain things right and when that light
[1:14:19] comes on it takes all the fear away
[1:14:24] cuz you know where things are you know
[1:14:25] what to avoid you know how to walk
[1:14:27] around this you're not wondering I hope
[1:14:29] there isn't a dog toy in the floor hope
[1:14:31] there's not
[1:14:32] Legos you know some of those things that
[1:14:35] we as parents we have stepped on and
[1:14:36] still bear the marks in our
[1:14:40] body right some things that we but what
[1:14:43] does light do light helps you to avoid
[1:14:46] things it it REM what does it do it
[1:14:49] removes that of of the scare or of the
[1:14:51] worry brother BR goes on to say the
[1:14:53] Christian has not one worry in the world
[1:14:58] I know some of you are thinking we I
[1:15:00] need an update right now I I I want this
[1:15:03] right here I want I want this new update
[1:15:05] to fix that bug that's going on in my
[1:15:07] mind right now aren't you glad he's here
[1:15:09] to do that the Christian has not one
[1:15:12] worry in the world they should be the
[1:15:14] most freest happiest people in all the
[1:15:19] world because there's look at this you
[1:15:21] can't lose
[1:15:26] Lord have mercy you can't lose he has
[1:15:29] never been defeated he's never lost a
[1:15:34] battle the word has never been conquered
[1:15:37] the word has never been defeated and the
[1:15:41] same one that's never been defeated has
[1:15:43] put his right hand upon your life and
[1:15:45] said do not
[1:15:47] fear I am he who was dead and I'm alive
[1:15:50] forever more I have the keys of death
[1:15:54] Hell In The Grave a mighty conqueror
[1:15:57] letting you know you can't
[1:16:02] lose now I know this is simple I can
[1:16:04] only go by experiences God brings them
[1:16:06] to me but when I when I was in high
[1:16:08] school and and many of you know that I I
[1:16:10] played football one of the things that
[1:16:11] they would told us to
[1:16:12] do all through Friday our coach coach
[1:16:16] cookie told us he said look you got a
[1:16:18] game you got things to prepare for you
[1:16:19] need to start getting you need to get
[1:16:21] your mind right
[1:16:24] so you know being the kind of person I
[1:16:26] am that I don't like to joke around or
[1:16:30] nothing there was a lot of Temptations
[1:16:32] on them Fridays to cut up with
[1:16:36] buddies but the thing that I would have
[1:16:39] in my mind is is getting through that
[1:16:41] line and getting that
[1:16:42] quarterback right oh man catch them when
[1:16:46] their backs turned to you and there you
[1:16:48] know all those things and but that's
[1:16:50] what that what we were taught to me I'm
[1:16:52] so thankful for some of those things
[1:16:54] that just it taught me preparation
[1:16:56] within many things when we would go into
[1:16:59] pregame meal I told my boys I said as
[1:17:01] soon as you come in them doors you could
[1:17:02] hear a pin drop you weren't allowed to
[1:17:05] talk one iota you were not allowed to
[1:17:07] talk in the locker room you had to have
[1:17:09] your mind on your assignment and what
[1:17:12] you were going to be doing I think how
[1:17:14] fitting that it would be that how our
[1:17:16] mind that sometimes our mind can get on
[1:17:19] this our mind can get on that our mind
[1:17:21] can get on negative you you listen
[1:17:23] you're never going to get anywhere in
[1:17:25] Victory if you entertain the thought of
[1:17:29] defeat oh brother Samuel that's just
[1:17:31] mind over matter no it's different if
[1:17:34] we're talking about your thoughts I'm
[1:17:36] talking about the word thoughts I'm
[1:17:38] talking about the word you cannot find
[1:17:41] any defeat in the word amen and after
[1:17:45] all it's not my thoughts or your
[1:17:47] thoughts that has life in it it's the
[1:17:49] word that has life in
[1:17:52] it
[1:17:54] wo you can't lose all things work
[1:17:57] together for the good to them that love
[1:17:58] God so how can we lose there's just
[1:18:01] nothing nothing to lose is there we're
[1:18:04] just anchored away in Jesus Christ going
[1:18:06] home to glory having a good time while
[1:18:09] we're going along God providing
[1:18:11] everything for us
[1:18:13] marvelous you know I believe this so
[1:18:15] much that if I'm reading this quote
[1:18:16] right here I believe that the Holy
[1:18:18] Spirit can get a hold of a life and that
[1:18:20] life to say you know what that's what I
[1:18:21] want to I want to be a part of that
[1:18:24] Divine Assurance what is it the love of
[1:18:26] God Woos them right in yes
[1:18:28] sir oh notice he says I wish you
[1:18:32] Pentecostal people could see that and
[1:18:34] why some people can't keep Victory
[1:18:35] that's one thing you're short in that's
[1:18:37] what brings fear and trouble to you oh
[1:18:41] you say brother brandom I'm afraid
[1:18:43] you'll go off on the deep end of eternal
[1:18:46] security and all
[1:18:49] this what is that worry right
[1:18:53] this is why that even with things even
[1:18:56] that I might see things go this way
[1:18:59] extreme go this way extreme so God help
[1:19:02] me just to keep it right here in the
[1:19:03] middle of the
[1:19:05] road help me to keep it right here in
[1:19:07] the middle of the road why because it is
[1:19:09] just oh I see that going there so we're
[1:19:10] going to overcorrect you end up in the
[1:19:12] ditch over here are you hearing me you
[1:19:14] don't overcorrect because overcorrect it
[1:19:17] goes completely the wrong way just got
[1:19:19] to get it just line it up keep it right
[1:19:21] down the center keep it balanced right
[1:19:23] up that's what gives you and I stability
[1:19:25] in our
[1:19:28] lives Hallelujah watch this look how
[1:19:31] brother how look how brother answers it
[1:19:32] you don't have to worry about that if
[1:19:35] you keep your heart in the Bible it
[1:19:37] won't
[1:19:39] that's that's simple our heart staying
[1:19:42] in the word of God God has changed our
[1:19:46] desires now let me just let me just try
[1:19:48] to move here on this on just a part of
[1:19:50] this try to bring it down to a place
[1:19:52] here for us tonight in um 2 Timothy
[1:19:58] 1:7 now watch
[1:20:01] this for God hath not given us the
[1:20:06] spirit of
[1:20:08] fear so so any time that we find feel
[1:20:11] that encroachment that didn't come from
[1:20:14] God this is
[1:20:16] discernment but this is the spirit that
[1:20:18] God has given us of power of love and of
[1:20:22] a sound mind Romans 8:15 for ye have not
[1:20:26] re to come with worry you push it back
[1:20:28] away oh we found a little spot here well
[1:20:32] it might have been a fly that got on
[1:20:33] your
[1:20:35] machine I'm not making light of these
[1:20:37] things but I'm saying look look how
[1:20:39] things
[1:20:40] come and it comes to test us and we're
[1:20:43] not careful we will get in such a place
[1:20:46] of worry those feelings are normal I
[1:20:50] hope you understand me tonight I do not
[1:20:52] belittle no one from my family to
[1:20:55] anybody else here for you having
[1:20:59] worry cuz I tell you the truth a lot of
[1:21:01] times the people that want to do those
[1:21:03] things well you shouldn't have worry you
[1:21:05] should have fear if you go to looking up
[1:21:07] things that they've done in their life
[1:21:09] when they oh I got a little pain right
[1:21:11] here I got oh what about that worry now
[1:21:14] what about stopping worry where's
[1:21:16] where's that where's that big Faith at
[1:21:18] now I'm not trying to be running anybody
[1:21:21] down but I'm just trying to say listen
[1:21:23] we're all still in this Humanity some of
[1:21:25] us are geared a little bit more
[1:21:27] differently than others you take for
[1:21:29] example a lot of times maybe our sister
[1:21:32] sometimes can be more prone to that the
[1:21:33] prophet said they operate on a different
[1:21:36] emotional level than what we do as men
[1:21:40] and for all the married Brothers you
[1:21:41] don't have to say Amen but you know it's
[1:21:43] true or anybody that has daughter or
[1:21:45] daughters you know it's true so don't
[1:21:46] say amen I don't want no rocks being
[1:21:48] thrown
[1:21:49] tonight but notice we understand those
[1:21:52] things even sometimes we even as men and
[1:21:54] other things can be prone to those
[1:21:56] things but yet God gives you and I the
[1:21:59] grace that's needed to be able to press
[1:22:01] and push these things out of our life
[1:22:04] there's no way in the world that I'm
[1:22:05] going to even get close to it tonight
[1:22:06] maybe even not next Thursday but I can
[1:22:08] go through numerous moments of times in
[1:22:11] the prophet's life where there was worry
[1:22:13] that sprung up and God gave him Grace
[1:22:17] you know what that shows me God was
[1:22:19] showing me along the journey boy you're
[1:22:21] going to have times of worry there's
[1:22:23] going to be fear coming along the way
[1:22:24] but I want you to know not I've said it
[1:22:26] my grace is sufficient but I am using an
[1:22:28] example in this age so you can see it
[1:22:31] for your own
[1:22:35] life I'm glad it I'm glad it wasn't you
[1:22:38] or me because maybe for us we have man
[1:22:40] wanting to make oursel with edit that
[1:22:42] part out of that tape edit that part out
[1:22:43] we only want it to
[1:22:46] be what's that a form of
[1:22:49] worry how am I going to be perceived
[1:22:52] Lord have
[1:22:53] mercy but you know friends let me I'm
[1:22:56] trying let me just try to get to a spot
[1:22:57] where I can stop
[1:22:59] tonight their emotions that we can face
[1:23:02] from time to time but but never never
[1:23:04] never never should it become a resident
[1:23:08] in our
[1:23:09] lifeall if it becomes a resident or a
[1:23:12] squatter that's so good then we we have
[1:23:15] a right with divine grace to go before
[1:23:19] God and evict the squatter oh brother
[1:23:22] Samuel that that couldn't happen well
[1:23:24] the scripture tells us that we are to
[1:23:27] tear down
[1:23:28] strongholds the Bible tells us to give
[1:23:30] no place to the enemy I'm quoting out of
[1:23:33] Paul's letters so if he says don't do it
[1:23:36] that means you can do it if he tells us
[1:23:39] tear down strongholds that tells me
[1:23:41] strongholds can be
[1:23:43] built do you realize sometimes it is
[1:23:46] taken it took I'm my my daddy blessed
[1:23:49] his heart he's went on home to be with
[1:23:50] the Lord but you know my dad he had a
[1:23:52] situation it took place over there I
[1:23:54] think it was on West 50 55th or West
[1:23:56] 25th over there where they brought in
[1:23:58] them student dentist and things like
[1:23:59] that and my dad talked about he said
[1:24:01] here he put them things on my tooth he
[1:24:03] said to pull out my tooth he said and I
[1:24:05] was out in the floor with him having a
[1:24:06] hold on that tooth he tried it again
[1:24:10] almost sounds like three stoes or
[1:24:11] something but he said here it is he said
[1:24:13] it tried it
[1:24:14] again from that time Mom I I don't know
[1:24:17] how old dad
[1:24:18] was 20 22 maybe
[1:24:21] 23 I could prank my dad by calling our
[1:24:25] answering machine and changing my voice
[1:24:27] and saying Mr Browning this is to remind
[1:24:29] you of your dental appointment at such
[1:24:32] and such my dad would look at me and say
[1:24:35] Samuel you didn't you didn't he didn't
[1:24:37] want to go you know why he was
[1:24:40] afraid that experience brought
[1:24:45] fear but you know what God gave him
[1:24:48] Grace to overcome that fear later in his
[1:24:51] life but I'm just trying to show you
[1:24:52] little things like that that sometimes
[1:24:54] that we worry about you let somebody say
[1:24:57] something oh I tell you what don't go to
[1:24:58] this Hospital you go to this Hospital
[1:25:00] sure as the world they're going to put
[1:25:01] you in a casket what does it do spreads
[1:25:04] right through
[1:25:06] worry that's right that's so these are
[1:25:10] real life things friends oh brother
[1:25:13] Samuel I'm and listen we're talking
[1:25:15] about applying the word and letting the
[1:25:17] word as a son and daughter of God being
[1:25:20] victorious in our life over these things
[1:25:22] because listen they're going to come but
[1:25:26] God gives us Grace to stand against
[1:25:28] them now watch this in the message the
[1:25:30] True Vine and a false Vine brother BR
[1:25:33] says I see now to this woman that's
[1:25:34] standing near she has a real dismal
[1:25:38] funny spirit it's a spirit of worry
[1:25:43] fearful she's all nervous and upset and
[1:25:46] she's bothered a lot with a nervous
[1:25:49] condition so what is worry it's a spirit
[1:25:53] a spirit of worry it's about a condition
[1:25:56] of her body that she's worrying about
[1:25:59] she's planning on an examination at a
[1:26:01] clinic kind of a hospital clinic or
[1:26:03] Affair for cancer it's a cancer that
[1:26:06] you're worried about and you was praying
[1:26:08] just before coming here it was revealed
[1:26:11] to you as you were praying that if you
[1:26:12] would come here and I would pray for you
[1:26:14] that they'd find no
[1:26:16] cancer and he goes on to tell where
[1:26:18] she's come from and he says you're going
[1:26:19] to get the desire of your heart you have
[1:26:22] it right now in the name of the Lord
[1:26:24] Jesus Christ may it be received in
[1:26:27] jesus' name God bless you Sister go
[1:26:30] happy and
[1:26:33] rejoicing my my my don't you love
[1:26:42] him
[1:26:45] Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Bria going
[1:26:48] down to that quote 1956 the resurrection
[1:26:51] of Jesus let me just let me close on
[1:26:56] this Ram says if you notice it's when
[1:26:59] you are
[1:27:00] discouraged that's when the devil can
[1:27:02] really pour it on
[1:27:03] you that's when he gets you if you come
[1:27:06] to church and say well I don't know I
[1:27:07] don't know whether I'll ever get any
[1:27:09] better or not I've been prayed for twice
[1:27:12] oh my you might as well go home that's
[1:27:14] all but when you can cast that aside
[1:27:19] once again acting like your father what
[1:27:22] did he do in heaven cast him
[1:27:24] out casting him out God don't want you
[1:27:28] to be frowning God wants you to be happy
[1:27:32] the human heart was made to be happy
[1:27:35] worry will cause cancer temper will
[1:27:40] cause cancer don't never be upset just
[1:27:43] walk in his love amen well how do I walk
[1:27:48] in his love I love this next quote
[1:27:51] knowing that your you're walking in him
[1:27:54] nothing can harm you there's nothing can
[1:27:57] harm you there's neither Powers things
[1:27:59] present things future nothing can
[1:28:02] separate us from him we're in him and we
[1:28:05] never come in by our own will he by
[1:28:08] choice elected us and brought us into
[1:28:11] him so it's his business to take care of
[1:28:14] what he's took his no man can pluck them
[1:28:17] from my father's hand cuz he's the
[1:28:19] greatest of all of them
[1:28:23] it's the father who takes care of it
[1:28:25] who's got any more power than God so
[1:28:28] what kind of a power have you got over
[1:28:30] to take care of you that's a pretty
[1:28:32] simple question what kind of power do
[1:28:34] you have to take care of
[1:28:36] yourself nothing of your own accord the
[1:28:39] whole powers that created the universe
[1:28:41] that took the solar system and said blew
[1:28:44] it like that every Star went to its
[1:28:46] place and he watches over you that's the
[1:28:49] kind of father Lord that we
[1:28:54] have that's the kind of
[1:28:57] father that we
[1:28:59] have lot of things that can be presented
[1:29:03] to us the Bible tells us of how the
[1:29:06] disciples they were out on the sea they
[1:29:10] were out in the
[1:29:11] boat storm arose Jesus was asleep in
[1:29:16] it and they woke him up don't you care
[1:29:23] that we
[1:29:26] perish Jesus said oh why are you
[1:29:30] fearful oh ye of little
[1:29:34] faith and he
[1:29:37] spoke to the condition remember he is
[1:29:40] the word he spoke the
[1:29:43] word and not only did it
[1:29:47] calm the
[1:29:49] storm it calmed the waves
[1:29:53] he was there the whole
[1:29:56] time and the situation arose all they
[1:29:59] needed to do was wake him
[1:30:03] up listen the same God that created the
[1:30:07] heavens in the Earth the same God that
[1:30:10] brought you and I here that same God a
[1:30:13] part of you that have the Holy Ghost

[1:31:05] everything within me Amen Let me just
[1:31:08] step aside from all worries and Fears

[1:31:13] things that would be presented to me as
[1:31:15] the word would deal with my life I want

[1:31:38] I'll look up and and look at it and if I
[1:31:41] feel L on my heart and the Lord will
[1:31:42] press it so I just looked it up what are
[1:31:44] some of the biggest things that is
[1:31:46] worried
[1:31:48] about and these are some things and I'm
[1:31:50] just I I'll close here after this some
[1:31:53] of the top 10 fears it's on down there
[1:31:55] Brian I don't know if you've got it yet
[1:31:56] the top 10 fears that hold people back
[1:31:59] in life now I started reading these and
[1:32:02] I can tell you right now it was just
[1:32:05] quotes and scriptures for these
[1:32:08] things
[1:32:10] change a lot of us don't like
[1:32:14] change true they tell you on Friday
[1:32:17] morning there's going to be some things
[1:32:19] we're going to be doing different here
[1:32:24] loneliness
[1:32:27] failure
[1:32:29] rejection
[1:32:31] true
[1:32:33] uncertainty something bad
[1:32:36] happening getting
[1:32:39] hurt right being
[1:32:43] judged
[1:32:45] inadequate and a loss of
[1:32:50] freedom I looked at those things and I
[1:32:53] thought my Lord just as the Lord just
[1:32:55] started to deal with that but I'm not
[1:32:56] going to go there
[1:32:58] tonight but just within every one of
[1:33:00] those little things all of a sudden
[1:33:02] begin to come this begin to come this
[1:33:04] and begin to come that and look I'm glad
[1:33:06] that God looks to you and I and says he
[1:33:09] don't just say don't
[1:33:12] worry but he tells us don't worry let's
[1:33:15] go down into those things that you're
[1:33:18] worrying about let me come down in that
[1:33:20] area let me come down into that what
[1:33:23] you're uncertain about let me come into
[1:33:25] that
[1:33:26] area whatever whatever the fears are let
[1:33:29] me come in that area because wherever
[1:33:31] light is at it presses back Darkness
[1:33:35] Hallelujah so just with that little bit
[1:33:38] tonight why should I
[1:33:39] worry why should I worry what has he
[1:33:42] ever failed to
[1:33:47] deliver I'm glad for his grace because
[1:33:49] you realize a lot of times some of these
[1:33:51] things I just read right here at the end
[1:33:53] it can cause decisions to be
[1:33:57] made and they're made outside of the
[1:34:00] word of God rather than being made on
[1:34:03] God's word we'll make it based on our
[1:34:07] worry aren't you glad let me just drop
[1:34:09] one little one I'm not going to read it
[1:34:11] but just so you can see I'm not just out
[1:34:12] here in the
[1:34:14] Stars Moses knew
[1:34:17] humanity and he was there before the
[1:34:19] burning bush and he asked God time after
[1:34:23] time and he says they ain't going to
[1:34:25] believe me right they ain't going to
[1:34:27] believe me what is it he's
[1:34:30] worried cuz he knows Humanity because he
[1:34:34] knows his own self he also knows I've
[1:34:37] been rejected before for saying the same
[1:34:40] thing worry but aren't you glad that God
[1:34:44] didn't look at him and say you old worry
[1:34:46] Ward I should have got somebody else but
[1:34:48] God likes to take our weaknesses amen
[1:34:52] amen and get it to where they come all
[1:34:55] out and then he just pours himself

[1:35:38] amen oh I just just love the
[1:35:42] Lord I tell you there's nothing about it
[1:35:44] where the peace of God comes into a
[1:35:46] heart and a
[1:35:47] life it releases us from all the that
[1:35:51] worry as far as our destiny and that's
[1:35:54] that that's the main thing that that's
[1:35:56] the main thing right there for that to
[1:35:57] be released that I know and whom I have
[1:35:59] believed
[1:36:01] that's that's the main but then through
[1:36:04] that he gives us
[1:36:05] strength through every other area every
[1:36:08] other part of our life I'm glad for
[1:36:11] that I tell you I I just I not only love

[1:37:35] their worry was made known they it was
[1:37:37] uncovered in his presence he's never
