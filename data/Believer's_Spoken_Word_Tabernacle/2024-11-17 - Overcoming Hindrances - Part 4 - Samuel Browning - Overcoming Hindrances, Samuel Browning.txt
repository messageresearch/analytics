hallelujah yes he will oh yes see will let's have church hallelujah what a savior let's have church thank you Lord Jesus I've got a very very brief testimony this morning uh it's a good testimony on my son who had a car accident 13 months ago it was a near fatal accident but uh he survived with only Orthopedic injuries nothing uh life-threatening such as brain head neck spine and that sort of thing uh which we are still 13 months later thankful for uh as I was putting this together last night I was thinking um I really didn't want to have to admit this but um Ben is still suffering from PTSD he has been uh manifesting a number of Behavioral cues that uh Point firmly in this direction I've seen it all along in 13 months but I've just kind of pretended it wasn't there hoping that you know that was not the case because um you know PTSD is a very uh it's very complicated uh it's very complicated situation you know like uh my wife is suffering from PTSD also but you know in PTSD there's not just the initial trauma that that's that's injurious to to the mind but it's all the things that come after it like in my son's son's case you know the trauma starts when he wakes up at the crash site and he's in the most unimaginable pain possible well that puts the stake down for PTSD and all of the pain uh you know for much of the 13 months he's been in n91 level pain uh all of what comes after that with pain and disappointment etc etc it just kinds it kind of um continued to give life to the to the PTSD and so uh that is a cause of concern for me but um he has been seeing a counselor who's uh agreed to see him uh at a virtual visit and uh you know we're so U we're so thankful so thankful for that and uh you know also my wife uh you know there was the initial shock of hearing about the accident and then um you know when you're walking down the hall at the clinic in the trauma unit you can see him at the end of the hall and that's your son you know that's man that's some tough uh that's some tough stuff and um but uh you know for her and and I don't understand this because I'm not a mother um I wish I did maybe I could be of a more more of a of help but you know she has to watch her child be in constant pain she has to watch her child in pain through Physical Therapy uh just you know I don't you get it I mean I don't need to go on and on you get it and she's she's a witness to all that and you know even though I experience the same thing I'm not a mother and uh it's something that's that's really left its uh left its mark on her as I was thinking about this last night uh go ahead and put that quote up I I came across something that Charles uh Spurgeon said that really blessed my heart and gave me uh comfort as to uh the fact that the Lord knows everything dear Spurgeon said few will associate with the depressed but Jehovah chooses their company and stays until he has healed them with his Comfort he wants to handle and heal the brokenhearted he applies the ointment of grace and the soft bandages of love he binds the bleeding wounds of those that are convicted of sin this is Godly compassion Glory it really blesses me about this quote this not this is not some Namby pambi incubator chicken like we got today this is a man who's whose life with Christ was forged in a very in the iron furnace he had many things that he suffered but uh through all of that ironically there was joy and only a Christian can understand that that you can be ever in ever so much pain physically mentally otherwise but joy will be the con but joy will be the constant I didn't say happiness I said Joy PA Paul wrote about joy in Philippians when he was in jail Joy is our Birthright and that that just gives me tremendous tremendous Comfort today um Ben was recently signed out of physical therapy since arriving home after since arriving home after being in a nursing home uh back in August he's been doing all of his therapy homework assigned to him by the clinic and he's developed his own exercise regimen exercises that he does on his own which is which is great see that he has that motivation that takes a lot of takes a lot of motivation you know to be in that much pain and to be in the frame of mind that he is but to go ahead and push on you know and push on uh he's also U started studying for his uh computer license exams and uh that's a lot of that's a lot of tough brain work but you know praise God he has the motivation and the the mental strength to be able to do that and uh I've watched him it's uh it's a remarkable thing he can walk on crutches he can walk to and from the car as well as to and from wherever we're going with whether it's doctor's appointments or other appointments he has to go to he can walk upright upright up a flight of stairs GL that can go from the living room to the upstairs all he needs is a spotter but he is doing the rest of it on his own he's not scooting up there on his on his backside there's two rails and he's pulling himself up and it's um man it's it's it's amazing it's so cool uh let's see what else oh yes um and and also you know he's able to do whatever he needs to do that requires his privacy he needs absolutely no help with any of any of that uh last Saturday the three of us Ben My Little Queen and myself we went to Costco for pizza and uh I believe this was the first time he's been out to dinner somewhere yes it was and so you know she drops us off at the at the handicapped Lane and he walks to the he walks through the door she comes and meets us I said hey son you want to come sit with me while I read no I'm going to walk with Mom and so he and the Little Queen walked around [Music] Costco did their shopping he didn't use a motorized buggy the Lord uh he didn't fall over he didn't even complain he didn't even complain I know he was in pain hallu know he was in pain but he was he was there and so afterward the three of us sat down and we had hot dogs and pizza and I'll tell you pizza's never tasted so good it was just it was just so good to to just sit there I I don't think we would have been any more happy if we were at the finest restaurant in the world uh but to just be there as a family and just do something normal for a change something that didn't involve a hospital uh it's it's just a great thing uh let's see I said that I said that uh yeah and last night um Friday night we went to uh uh beastro De La Luna in uh Oberlin and we had a a night out for dinner to celebrate uh the little queen's birthday and again you know we sat there and had just a really delicious meal but uh you know I've had delicious food before trust me but um you know this this was special you know you just thank God for the little things you just thank God for the little things and so you know as I I close this up I just want to you know thank you um 3 weeks after the accident uh I came back to church from spending time in the hospital uh with my wife and my son and U this is going to be hard everybody was so kind to come up and I mean everybody to express very sincere concern God and promises that they would pray for my son and I knew when I heard I will pray for your son I knew I could count on those prayers and I'll tell you why in months after that as even as recent as recently people are still coming up and telling me I'm still praying for your son how's he doing he's still on my [Music] mind that's what Christians are about that's right that's what Christians are about so thank you thank you today and my son every time somebody asks about him I tell my son and he just looks at me he says tell him thank you Dad tell him thank you Dad amen but my wife it's made a profound profound impact on her um she's just I I don't know it's it's changed her and uh she's had she has history with this church especially with a couple of sisters here and uh they've been very mindful to ask about her and I relay that to her and uh you know I've known her for over 40 years I know I could tell by the littlest facial expression what she's thinking and it just has made an impact on her just made a real it's just really really really touched her and uh you know that's how this wasn't in to say this when we talk about the power of God and the grace of God and the love of God and all those great attributes of God but God uses his church his bride to mediate that power he could just plunk it down like a lightning bolt but he takes individuals he takes their personality he takes their experiences he takes all of what they've been through to develop strength that power goes through that power goes through them with all of what they've been through Into the Heart of who he wants ministered to and it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing friends you never know when you shake hands with somebody in that vestibule and you give you hug their neck you have no idea what they might be going through right so be available or as I like to say live your life redemptively live your life as a redeemer one that's there to mediate God's compassion his concern his encouragement uh whatever he he chooses to be be a redeemer because after all like brother brandom said we are Messiahs ready all [Music] right who tells the sun to rise every morning wakes up with Mercy all of his love Jesus Does [Music] who holds his bin Comforts The Widow cries for Injustice and feels every sorrow carries the pain of his children Jesus [Music] does so we sing praise to the Father for giving his son praise PR to the spirit who's living in us when

things are possible [Music] isn't that a wonderful privilege to be able to believe amen that certainly is a it's a gift that comes from God and um you know it's something that that's really every that's what it's all based on is to believe amen with every part of every growth and every part of our life it's all based on faith just when God deals with our hearts sometimes just from the New Birth it begins with faith God takes a hold of your life it begins by faith to recognize that what he's already done for me that's faith brother Bram says As We Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ said there's a he said he described it like a gust of wind he said it's it's a lift that comes into your life that begins to lift you above the things of this world then then this faith it continues to build into a place to where then it brings us into that of a real birth with Jesus Christ where his own life is in us and then through every stage of our life everything anything that you or I can look at in our life and say my and look back and say God where you brought me from that started from Faith you the word you heard the word the word was quick into your heart and you surrendered to it and then it built itself in your life ain't that awesome I mean it's to me it's just just overwhelming I've I've been just really to tell you I've just been really meditating and really dwelling in um the message the statue of a perfect man and just seeing how everything in our life it always comes from that of faith everything that God does in our life is just that it's always that Foundation all that he does it's based on us believing I tell you I say God let your let the holy spirit let the penetrating rays of the S so n come in this morning that's what we need that's what we need there's a lot of words that we could say but we don't it's not the words we don't need a lot of words we just need him and when he begins to penetrate as he said let there be light that was a few words let there be light a few words but look what it brought forth right because it was it was his light it was his life and and that's what we need it's not the amount of words we just need him to come by our way this morning and that's what we want amen you want that I want that we need that we just don't want it I need it we we need it Lord I need you you're this morning amen so we just are so thankful to be gathered here today and uh looking forward to What the Lord Has for us and then as well for the fellowship dinner that will follow and I don't want to get ahead of myself I don't want to look have head to the fellowship dinner but um but I certainly am so thankful to God's mercy amen aren't you yes sir amen God bless you amen let's just could we just bow our heads together in a word of prayer and then we'll go we'll read our right into the scriptures and let's pray together I I certainly covet your prayers as well this morning and that we'll just pray for one another just invite the Holy Spirit he's here let's just invite him to come in a very personal way Heavenly Father Lord we are standing here Lord by the grace of God and Father we are Lord truly in need of your mercies once again this morning Lord that God you would pass by our way Lord and father just Lord in those same reality Lord that you would Breathe Upon Our Lives oh God and Father for it's in the breath of the almighty there lays inspiration oh God it's same thing father in your word that brought conditions Lord that Ezekiel Saw in that valley of dry bones Lord it was you who brought Lord father things that was scattered you brought it together Lord you brought it in position and you gave it life you brought movement Lord and so the father that when that was all said and done what was seen was your desire your heart your life it was you Lord on display and father that's what we're seeing right here Lord we Are Witnesses in our own lives we were scattered Lord but you've assembled us Lord un yourself Lord It's You Lord that has father brought everything in position It's You Lord that has breathed into our life oh God that loving kindness that's better than life it's you that has set our feet upon a straight path Lord so here this morning Lord we are standing Lord God indebted to the grace and mercy of almighty God and how thankful we are Lord we are appreciative this morning lord of the grace of God that is swept by our lives and can continues to move through our lives Lord we just ask that God that you would just be with us to the today Father anoint our hearts and our ears Lord anoint the lips that would speak God may you give us Grace together Lord as speaker and hearer to step aside for a few moments Lord that you might speak and move and work in our lives and Achieve Lord what you desire to be achieved now we give you all the praise honor and glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen amen Ephesians chapter 4 God bless you thank you musicians amen and U I want to just read a few vers of scripture out of Ephesians 4 and we've been uh drawing from this here um and looking at it for a few times on overcoming hindrances and you know I got to looking at the um when as we look at this and um you know I was just really uh in my heart I was telling my wife the other day I said I've wanted to get back into Ruth into certain areas but I said I realized that as I've looking at this you remember one of the last things we spoke on Ruth was from his feet to the throne and so there's a journey but the journey itself to the throne begins in the feet we all have to come to the foot of Calvary and so everything that's in our life it all comes through his feet and so when we look at that and we are know that within it all that it's God who's bringing us along in our journey and so as we're looking at this part of it on overcoming hindrances so uh I want to look here in Ephesians 4 and just read a few vers of scripture beginning with verse 17 if we could start there verse 17 please this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanliness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that ye have heard him have you heard him and been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus so not as the truth is in a man but as the truth is in Jesus he he is the word is that right the word made flesh the very person of God that ye notice that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness so it's it's sinking into him verse 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated uh I want to come back into that point here uh this morning also wanted to say God bless you Sister Kathy it's good to have you here amen and um I know they already welcomed you but it's good to have you here and uh so it's good to have I know different ones as we've checked on different ones and sickness has been through the body and uh you know it's so good and I thought some weeks ago and I am Pour at this and I think you're great I'm thankful for your grace and overlooking I get so I'm I'm this is one PL I'm just focused right here but uh and I know that's where you would want me to be but I'm so glad a few weeks ago and I seen brother brother Dave Crest back here with us and uh the Lord has certainly been merciful there amen and U also with sister Wilma it's so good to to see her and you know it just uh it it has been such a journey and I know Sister wil she was here back in October and she's been here throughout she just had a little bit of it's like the rest of us have dealt with different things of sickness but I'm tell you it's been a journey since where the Lord has brought sister Wilma through but um we're so thankful amen for God's grace so glad for each and every one of you amen we're glad to be here aren't we amen amen so I want to look here at this thought as we begin dealing with the last time we were together on a overcoming hindrances and we've been looking at this and it's things as we look at it it's it's always um that our desire is that it would that Christ himself would be the display through our life and that uh with that you know it's something that it's just it's God who does who is doing the work in our life he's making himself known uh through our lives in many different ways it's um you come back to the the the message that brother Bram preaches before is a key message before the seals on God hiding himself in Simplicity but that's not all the title he hides in Simplicity and then he reveals himself in the same way so when we think of when Revelation when truly Revelation comes to our life which that's what we want we we want revelation let me just say this when Revelation comes and this is why that the prophet said you want to pray for Revelation I'm just going to say this to you that when you begin to pray and seek after God if there is any hindrance in your life the light of God will show that hindrance so that that can be put out of your life that more Revelation can come in you see what I'm saying so it's not about us trying to say I got to get this out of my life I got to get this the reality is we wouldn't even know what it is we need to get out of our life or what is the hindrance but as we're seeking after him God is the one who Reveals All the hindrances or if we come to a place in our life and say I just don't have the joy that I that I had once before uh I I know what God has done in my life but the joy just isn't there as it was before now that doesn't mean that we've gone off or something wrong or maybe even something that we're speaking on here today that there's something wrong like this in our life but I believe as a belie Bel ver there our desire is to live and should be with such a certainty in the coming of the Lord is that I I want to be certain in my walk with God that with my life that it's available to him you know it's kind of like you in the utensils you have in your home you want things to be available and when you're going to eat something you don't want to have to say where are the forks oh they're all in the dishwasher uh that's not going to work you have to you want things to be available and God's desire is that his word and our working in our life that it would be available Brian I need a little bit more brother Brian I didn't hear just a little bit more they God's desire is that that our lives would be available unto him at all times God wants us to live as the prophet said it in one way in a Carefree condition Carefree meaning that where I'm not bogged down bothered and hindered by the problems of life or anything that I see in somebody else that's not that's not my problem I want to live Carefree in the in him I want that I want that Joy the joy of your salvation it's a joy in knowing that you know what I don't know what today holds or what tomorrow holds but I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able sir and the joy of the Lord isn't bubble dancing the joy of the Lord is you know where you're standing even in the midst of trials in the midst that it might be gray skies all around but you've got joy and it's a joy the world didn't give the world can't take it away it's the joy of the Lord that even in the midst of Trials and tests it allows you and gives you strength to conduct yourself as a son and daughter of God that's the real joy of the Lord So within it we we want to just within that you know living in a place that where we are always available to him and so within this I want to just there's a scripture I want to go to and I want to really just focus on there's a difference when we think of pride pride can be something as we were looking at here some time ago and I have just a few more places on this with pride but Pride can come in so subtle in in in our lives and we know that within it I want to look at the part where there's a real difference and in that that you know what God himself and I want you to think of this God himself has pride in his achievements right he is God is proud of his achievements because it is his desire it's out no there's no Mal intent there's no there's no wrongful objective his desire is to bring his life into you and I that as the prophet said it like this in the message Oneness God's desire was that we would be him amen that's God's desire that's his achievement is that he would look upon you and I as Adam looked on Eve and say she's bone of my bone flesh and my flesh she is me that's God's achievement you see a church a church just just church theology can make you look like a church or or to where that you know you get to talking to somebody long enough oh you're Baptist oh you're Pentecostal oh you're this God doesn't want us identified under a fallen name we're to be identified in his his name one Lord One Faith one baptism there's one name given whereby then we must be saved Eve never took she never had her own name the Bible said their name their name was called Adam but after the fall and she received another seed that's when she received the name Eve is that right mother of all living right Adam was not the father of all living right so within that God's desire is not that our lives would be conformed uh into a place to where uh it's just something as though it's like on the outside but God's desire is that our lives would be him so now when I'm I'm coming into this the scripture here and I want you to look at the scripture this is where a scripture just drawing from uh in my heart Brandon can you go in turn it over for me please uh uh in in in in Proverbs 29:23 the Bible says a man's Pride now I want you to look at that for a moment a man's Pride shall bring him low now you and I did not have a choice when we came to the World by and through the sexual birth that we came we come under a fallen condition remember the fault took place because Satan coming through it was him using the vessel of the serpent beginning to anoint God's daughter to actually begin to want something more than what God had given her and he's actually anointing her with unbelief he's anointing her with pride you and I have come into this world under that with with here we are born in sin the Bible says shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking Lies We we come and listen even after when even God begins to deal with a person's heart and life and I can just speak it I'm speaking from my own experience there's things that automatically where fear wants to attack your mind how am I going to stand up to my friends how am I going to break my associates how am I going to lay these things down because what we're looking at is our own human strength but listen the key of it is remember in the Book of Revelations where John begins to hear the one that is he begins to hear the voice of God and the scripture says he turned to see the voice of him who spake he turned to see the one who was speaking to him and see that's the very thing when God is speaking to our lives if we want to hear him and as we hear him it's look at him who's speaking to you so when we see it that this this this Pride a pride a man's Pride not you know will bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in heart so when we are are seeing this that it's man's a man's Pride so there's an element that even after God doing a work in our life as as God comes into our life he comes into your home it's just like look if you were to sell your home to somebody else they may like your Decor they may like what you have and then again you know there was homes that I remember my wife and I looked at and we could look at online and I looked at and said that's too much work for me man I mean I I don't want to get I I don't want to strip no wallpaper I don't I'm sorry you might call me lazy or what more I'll stay right where I'm at I don't want to do none of that I I've seen all that from a little boy we're stripping so you get what I'm saying so when somebody comes into the house or purchase it they're going to make that house the way they want to make it and when God comes into your life through every door of your life he is the one that does the decorating in your life your life becomes uh with pictures and portraits of divine grace you can see grace of God in Esther's life the grace of God in Rebecca's life the grace of God in Moses life your whole surroundings in your life amen and he goes through every room am and that one first little room that he deals with is pride and to think about it that even even after the New Birth has come God continues to work in our life to Deliver Us from Pride because as long as we are in these bodies in this body and I'm talking about with that human Spirit we are going to have to continue to battle against it but let me just say it it's not to be focused as far as on Pride God doesn't want you focusing and saying oh I must not do this or I must not do that the whole key is as we will we live in his presence don't allow anything to accumulate in our life he will take care of all the other things amen remember like brother Bram tells us about the difference between a genuine plant and a hot bed plant he said the hot hot bed plants you got to keep spraying them and treating them and bugs and this and that brother Willie you know I'm talking about all the bugs oh they got black Mo oh they got this oh they got that and you you know you when you plant the you got to you got to take care of those plants you you have to tend to them but you see that's what happened happens with hot bed plants but a real genuine seed you don't have to spray it with all those things I mean look at it look at some of the places I I'm standing there in Arizona and I'm in places and here we are even up in saino Canyon and I'm just standing there in front of me and I'm looking I'm saying how does that cactus grow out of that rock those multiple different types of cactus how is that growing out of that rock I would not think to plant something in a rock you want nice soil the planet in but you know what nobody has to go down through Sabino Canyon and spring those things oh we got to watch out for this these certain bugs are coming along oh what bugs are invading now no it there is something within it that's built to aand is that right and that's the same thing that within our lives Amen in the presence of God let me tell you something you cannot get in the presence of God and an and and an and an evil thought remain or or some uncleanliness or or some spirit that would want to hinder in your mind you cannot come in the presence of God and it remained there it's like the it's like when brother Barry gave that example remember about those rats that were chewing those cords in that plane and that pilot was driving that that plane he he all of a sudden that pilot realized if I can just climb up higher I'm supplied with oxygen if I can just climb up higher it'll kill the rats in the plane and that's the same thing with God it isn't about God wanting you and I to say well I'm not going to do this and oh I need to worry about this it's simply climbing higher in him and the things of the world will die that's the truth that's why the depth of that scripture when it says in the book of Isaiah thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee Hallelujah so you know a man's pride and I want to say that there's an element of Pride that we that we would have that would be absolutely right you might say well how could that be well there's things that we should be thankful for um there's things that when we look at and being of a pride and and it's a proud like we can be proud of our family right there's times not maybe not all the time but there's times that that we can be uh proud of things that we can even see see them do maybe the certain steps and certain things there's certain elements and listen I'm going to say like this let let me just say this God doesn't wait till you and I get to the other side before he starts pouring Praise on us are you hearing me that's good God himself listen the Bible said the heavens rejoice when one sinner comes home rejoices when one life repents God don't say I'm going to withhold it I'm going to withhold it until until they get sealed God's but God begins to pour praise out amen is that right because remember you and I sometimes friends we don't we're not the one who decides and knows who who's called to what level and this and that we don't know that but notice within it all God himself he begins to pour out praise he encourages you and I are you with me this morning who was it that encouraged you in your walk it wasn't you it was God that encouraged you it was things that begin to move and and take place out of your life and my is encouraging you and reminding you when you got down on yourself and said man I I feel like such a failure I don't feel no good at all and his grace would sweep by and remind you you may not be what you want to be or what you ought to be but you're not what you used to be he knows how to encourage us he knows how to even discourage us without destroying us so you know it's nothing wrong with being proud or as far as having some pride within things you know when you come about come about things but yet whenever Pride itself and this is what I wants you to think about whenever Pride itself moves out from under the realization that it is the Lord and his gracious working in our lives then that's where God begins to withdraw himself because God cannot dwell where pride is he he can't that that kind of Pride he can't he can't dwell when that kind of Pride begins to be about self something that would begin to exalt above him you know God reminded even would remind Israel when they would come into the land of everything that they would come in the land they never supplied the seed they're the one they're they're not the ones who planted the things God God permitted allowed the Heathen to plant those things with Israel in mind let me tell you the things that you and I would even be enjoyed today God can allow the Heathen but God permits it for your use come on friends you look at like the tape recorder real to real you know a lot of people benefited from that record players but God allowed that because he would record a message in this end time God never intended that kind of thing to promote rock and roll music and everything else God intended it to promote the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that right Israel when they came in the land they're not the ones who did that and God warned them in Deuteronomy he said Les he said remember when you get in the land don't forget you get all of this around you and you can begin to forget where I brought you from yes sure now I want to just think of this for a moment this this Pride let me just let me dwell on this here just a few moments on this Avenue of it in Ephesians 5 I don't have this up here cuz I I just want to refer to it when you think back in Ephesians 5 maybe if you want to write it down and or maybe open your Bibles to it or look back over here in in the after after service but the whole thing with Ephesians 5 beginning in verse 21 even through verse 28 listen you or I could not help ourselves that's right we were without any way out I don't know about you there's sometimes I still feel that way not just sometimes let me be honest a many times but when I say sometimes it's because sometimes God allows the realization to come to Samuel you're nothing without me you you didn't pull yourself out of sin I came to where you were at I'm the one that took care of the conditions in your life I'm the one who changed your nature I'm the one who became flesh I'm the one who shed my blood I'm the one who came look looking for you I'm the one who brought you to myself I'm the one who found you I'm the one who turned your heart I'm the one who dealt with your life I am the savior of the body hallelujah oh God let that be the anthem of our life he is my everything and let me tell you if you think about it think about it brother Brian how many times brother Brian would brother Brian brother Brandon would say over and over in the message he would say he said look if he saved you if he delivered you can't he heal your body he's got it all covered brother he's everything he's Jehovah JRA he's Jehovah Raa he's Jehovah Shalom he's Jehovah Tish he's everything all that I have need of he is everything so just being honest right ah many of the times I come into those places I say Lord H I really need you now I need him all the time but there's other times God just you know God God allows us to come into situations that there is no way human instrumentality that we can get ourselves out we can't even put two and two together in our mind but that's where our heart as a Believer this is where Faith this is where trust comes in just says yet Lord though I can look all around me yet will I trust in you no wonder David said what time I am afraid I will trust in you oh Lord hallelujah so there's times I I still need Deliverance am there's times I need Deliverance all of us can Fellowship on this sometimes our thoughts we get down the wrong channel in our thoughts come on we get the entertaining all it takes is one thought and we get to entertain in that one thought and we can start getting filling down and filling down and you know what it isn't you rescuing yourself it's him that rescues you you might say well I thought about this scripture who is it that dropped that scripture in your way I'll tell you who it is it's the same God that sent the Ravens to Elijah and brought him bread it's the same God that sees you in the conditions where you're at and he let you know I'm your savior I'm your deliverer I'm your comforter I'm your all in all Hallelujah glory be to [Applause] God oh my I feel like running but I got to preach watch this look look at this statement here a pride man's Pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit and say God keep me humble keep me humble I know there's a respon responsibility to laid on you and I but Lord You're the you're the one who's able to keep me where I need to be kept you know why for him for him lest I should get exalted let me read this this this this quote here my goodness I got to look at this some time ago my Lord let let's just read it here brother BR said God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church a church that the whole world could look up Bor as a bride of Christ well expected and espoused and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord it should live in that characteristic in the church it should be living that way but he said we find out too many times that good intentions that people are trying to make themselves act like Christians and they're trying to say I'm thus and I'm this and I must live this way that's not God's objective no sir brother brandham just said it very clearly in Christ is the mystery of God revealed when God listen when God came became flesh he took his word upon himself is that right the Bible said he he uh uh he who knew no sin became right became our sin that we might be made the very righteousness of God in Christ he he he became he was born of a woman right he he came listen if you and I needed Redemption he didn't need Redemption but Redemption is about bringing back what belongs to one you always belong to him you were always a part of him let me tell you the whole mystery of God all the way through the scriptures this is a drama that's been unfolded from the mind of God all the way down and we take us completely into the future home but it's all about him coming to redeem you and I bring us back to himself and notice we are his achievement and notice that statement that we would live in such an atmosphere and conduct ourselves in such a way that God would be proud of this church now remember there's a difference in man's Pride or that Pride that come from the enemy and God's Pride God's Pride will always stay in line that proud he's it's a display of himself of his character of his life it's actually his glory on display you know the scripture would say it like this it says for by grace are you saved through faith right well I did this and I sought after God no you didn't God sought after you well you know I begin to serve the Lord no God begin to turn your heart to desire to to serve him oh you know I was seeking no God wasn't lost we were lost he came and found us for by grace are you Sav through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast well I stopped doing this and I stopped doing that brother Bram says it in the Jubilee year he says many people say well I stop drinking and I stopped smoking and I stopped doing all that then if you stopped it then you have something to glory in but you see listen brother Ram goes on to say it he said but what it is it's to accept the person of Christ and then when he comes in all things cease are you hearing me when he comes in because Sin Sin as Sin is unbelief all these other things are attributes when he comes in he kills sin unbelief and so the attribute cease glory be to God I'm telling you this ain't self-help this is the gospel in demonstration and power that comes to work in our life and Deliver Us and cut away us from our first birth it's not of ourselves well I stopped this no I I didn't stop nothing amen as a matter of fact when God got a hold of my life oh there was a fear that came around my my life cuz I knew I what I had tried to stop I knew how I had tried to Live come on I don't disregard any of them previous experiences that I had maybe at this meeting or that meeting I'm just saying that what it was is God had to get my attention Samuel don't look at yourself I never spoke to you or called you that you would start looking at yourself look unto me I'm the author and finisher of your faith I'm the dissolver of all your doubts don't look at me and then look at yourself look at me who's speaking to you cuz I know what's in your life I know what's beneath the darkness hallu my my my Lord how many could say thank you Lord for we are his workmanship we're his workmanship means proprietorship meaning I'm I'm his I'm his personal work oh what you see is what he has done hallelujah oh I'm not perfect in myself but my perfection is in him and that Perfection of his life in me which is the changing of your desire that where our desire is is I want to do that which pleases him that's what allows the word to operate in our life and bring correction in our life and build in our life it's that desire that work Works in our heart by the holy spirit amen we're his workmanship amen we're not the workmanship of a church that's right are you with me you got listen fr the prophet tells us in Satan's Eden he says many times he said sometimes he said we find he said that we with Ministry he said is wanting to present themselves he said and Satan's desire is to establish himself in the people's hearts he said sometimes it's it's bringing an image into people's life I don't want you to be Samuel brownings God don't want you to be Samuel brownings he don't want you to be Browning nightes that's not God's that that's not God's intention that that that's a selfish man-made something that come from Satan and you know what that's all about is to keep you from the life you say what do you say I'm not your objective Christ is your objective he's the one that's being set before you it's Jesus Christ what he's done in my life he'll do in your life what he's doing in our lives he'll continue to work do in our lives that's right Hallelujah you not been called to a Ministry you are called to Jesus Christ Hallelujah let me tell you something friends Baptists produce Baptist Pentecostals produce Pentecostals right Catholics produce Catholics but only only Jesus Christ can produce real true living Christians that are expressions of of his own life we're not called to be an expression of a church we are called to be the expression of the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my from we his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works so in other words all everything he's already packed in you he just has to get us in condition to get it all out of us within one little seed has all of the apple seed has all of the leaves has all the apples all the Apple Chris you can make out of that's that that that that's my own private one right there but you inside of that and inside of that which God placed in your life what it is coming into his presence notice when Aaron's Rod got into his presence in his presence that Rod that part of an almond tree being in his presence what did it do it bued it blossomed it put forth leaves it bore almonds all in that place you know what that spoke up you would say that was a branch off of an almond tree and it was growing there without without being attached to the vine that was expressing Our Lives we were separated and alienated from the life of God but we couldn't get to where we needed to get to but God came down and he brought us into the holies of holies he said if I can just get Samuel there I'll just draw him there I'm not going to drive him there I'm not going to push him there I'm going to pour out my love I'm going to move on the rise of my word and get him in place and I will bring out of him what I know lays there Hallelujah I want you to love him now God's God has the right kind of a it's not a this parental Pride you know sometimes God's not looking at you and I and looks over our life and says well there ain't nothing wrong with them everything they do is is just ride on the money you know what if God wanted to he could have had it at this thing he could have had it to such a place to where you and I would have looked at Elijah and said Lord have mercy who could ever live a life like that he could have edited Abraham's life and you and I could have said goodness I don't think there's any chance for me he could have edited in such a way cuz you know what you do when you edit some of you are writers you know what I'm talking about when you edit you know you write something a lot of times they tell you just just get your thoughts on paper uh oh God just get them down and and you know just don't worry about it don't worry about it just write it out right now we we'll edit it it'll it'll get sent to an editor let me tell you something God's thoughts were being poured out even through the frailties and Humanity of Abraham and Noah and Elijah and when it came to Calvary The Mercy Seat it edited out all that was in Abraham it edited out all that was in Isaiah all said well you know what it was because it was Christ all the way through that's why when he asked who do men say that I am some say some say th are Isaiah some say th are Jeremiah some say why it was Christ in them in a portion and when Calvary came Hallelujah when Cal came here's the Old Testament there was a new when Calvary came oh my when the blood was shed it would not allow the mistakes and failures of Abraham to pass through over to the New Testament it wouldn't allow it and let me tell you something your name has been transferred your name has been transferred from the old book into the new book into the lamb section which you always were and you know what the blood of Jesus Christ will not allow sin to be attributed to your account blessed is the man in whom God will not impute sin Hallelujah brother that's something I can brag on right there I don't have nothing in myself I can brag on but I can brag on him I can brag on what he's done in my life so parental Pride it isn't that God just looking over our lives and you know just looking no no no no no no no God's hands on I said he's hands on God when he takes a hold of your life he's hands on I don't care of times that you may not feel him he's right there he said I'll never leave you no forsake you he's right there he's the same God that's with us through every test and every trial through every correction even when somebody begins to look you you know how this is you we can Fellowship on this when you first the Bible tells like this when we first were illuminated Hebrews 10 after we were illuminated we endured a great flight of of afflictions in other words we had persecution that came our way we had things where where all of this all of a sudden friends that we didn't know we had friends that showed up and different ones they weren't trying to encourage just they were trying to say you don't need to do all that I mean that's a little bit overboard but wait a minute it's not about something I'm trying to do you don't know the person that I've met this person that's touched my life when the woman at the well ran from the well she said come see amen that had told me all things it was the person that she met not an idea an idea would never change her from the lifestyle she was in ideas had condemned her ideas had isolated her to where she couldn't come to the well at a certain time but when he came hallelujah hallelujah he took care of what was in her life Hallelujah and when he came into her life you know what he did he out of her life only thing was coming forth there was things there was unrighteousness and all of this but he went down to the depths of her life and the well that was laying in her life he unsealed it he came in and exposed a hidden Source in her life he anointed her heart with his presence Hallelujah Lord have mercy Hallelujah so this parental Pride it isn't that we don't get spanking and Corrections what we do oh we do oh we do we we get Corrections sure we do thank God for them thank God for the Holy Spirit that'll go off in our life to say hey that's right thank God for the word that'll come around our way thank God for for God having surrendered vessels that would be willing to surrender to him and God could speak through it may not even be through a forceful way it might just be in such a little simple maybe teaching whatever more but he'll come and we recogniz his voice and what he's doing is calling us back in line you know why cuz he loves us he knows what he's called us to God's correction is not erratic in other words it's not get out of my face you're bothering me today amen I've just had a bad day man I'm fed up don't don't even cross my path that's not that's not that's not God God has never had a frustrating moment that's all right go ahead and raise your hands I will too say help me Lord help me Lord help me Lord because he's never I'm glad I'm glad that he's never you know why cuz I can draw from him he's the source that helps me and when I seem to get frustrated or feel frustrated in my spirit I've got a source a place that I can go to and let off the [Applause] pressure right I mean you know how them stock pots are insta pots insta hours you know how the end you mean stock pots are not stock pots what about sister pressure cookers right pressure cookers you know how it is I've been over place's house people's house and things like that Brother Carlos and I went to go visit a brother one time we were over at his house in an apartment there some years ago and they were telling me about when a pressure cooker went off man and blew I think it was in that place blew potatoes everywhere all and all I could do I was sitting there on and I you know I was trying to talk to the brother I had to get out of my mind what does this look like with potatoes all over it I had to get myself back in line you know but you know think about it how many times have we we blown more than potatoes everywhere sometimes there's been some clean up that we've had to do and say forgive me brother forgive me forgive me honey forgive my wife to my husband to my wife to my children forgive me you know uh just something right right you know what it was it ain't nothing it ain't you it in conditions you know what I I just wasn't letting off the pressure where I needed to be are you catching that this morning you know what that's about that's about him so there's nobody Among Us that's getting lifted up like oh my if I could just be like sister Stephanie if I if I could just be like you know sister Shirley if I could just be like sister Irma no no God's not interested in elevating any he's interested in elevating himself in our lives so that we can see Christ to know what he is in one he isn't another woo I'm trying to get through this here parental Pride God doesn't he doesn't withhold correction and I'm glad for it you know uh when you think about it let me just read the Scripture it says my son in Hebrews 12 despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him I think that's a I think that's tremendous because anybody here like dispas in the Lord no I won't ask you how you feel cuz I know how you feel I know how you feel but see God's desire is that we would not faint but he makes a way that our lives would be corrected see his desire is not to crush us demean us exasperate us take life out of us no no he says we just need to get this corrected out right here I mean you know how it is if you told your child not to do this and you said no don't do that and they go ahead and do it well you correct them why you correct because that right there that you told them not to touch hot stove or whatever more I mean for some reason kids just they hot I wonder what this is once they get that experience they never ask again but you know there's certain things you tell them to do and they go ahead and do it then why do you correct them you don't correct them just for the sake of correcting them you correct them because you know that could bring them great harm and that's the same thing when God corrects you or I he knows what is laying down the road it's like when a man is sighting in a gun and when we sight in our bows to go hunting if you're off if you're off right here just even at 5 yards 10 yards then if you're off there you've got to get that 10 yard pin sided in then you can get the 20 yard pin then you can get the 30 yard pin sided in see you got to start with things that are very close then it allows you to move on to things that are further away does that make sense it's how God is working with those things getting us lined up because let me tell you something God's got the goal for your your life and my life and that's the Rapture that's the change of the body that that's God's goal that's why all the correction that's why the ministry of the word that's why he deals with our life that's why tests and Trials come the way they do is because God has a goal in mind and that goal is himself being raptured himself being raptured you are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life you are him in bright form all right let me just Stout for a minute back in Eden here God brought forth Adam and then Adam was the bride right but after Calvary here where his side was open which Adam was a prefigure of Calvary right out of his side was open out came in out come water blood and spirit those three things agree in one to bring about the real true birth in the life of a Believer and now here stands a people a bride of Jesus Christ and now he is the one veiled in her Hallelujah Calvary produced The Hidden man of the heart it's Christ in you the hope of glory you are his achievement you are his workmanship that's what Calvary has produced so this is where don't don't faint when you're rebuked of him the scripture said as many as I love I rebuke and chasing not as many as love me as many as I love that's why the prophet said don't ever make don't ever make Jesus the object of human love he said that's not what the scripture said it didn't say as many as love me it says as many as I love right it makes you think about rebuking and chasing a little different now honestly I I don't like rebuking and chastening but it kind of lets you know it was like you know the football coach that I had in syusy he just would stop us when we came out there he said it every single year I play for him he said let me tell you something boys he said before we start this year he said there's going to be times he said where the coaches he said we're going to he said we're going to get on you now now my coach was one he didn't believe in swearing if you swear you might as well shut your mouth you didn't have nothing worth saying anyhow so we don't have to worry about none of that but man he he said look we're going to get on you he said the reason we'll get on you he said because we know there's you've got more in you than what you're putting out now to me those are things I just I I I carried right over here because I realize when when God gets on me he ain't running me down he's letting me say Samuel you got more potential in you than that and he's not asking me for my efforts he's asking me to surrender my will he's not asking me put forth a greater effort put forth a no he's asking me surrender yes you know how they tell you when they go to give you a shot they don't tell you tense up they don't tell you to tense up they say relax s Mariel is that right they tell you to relax right when they're going ready to give you shot relax right relax just look the other way you smell that alcohol you're like Lord help me remember from Thursday Lord I trust they got the numbing agent but notice this this is why brother Brandon would say this you've heard this quote many different times I think it's I know it's very simple but it's things brother BR would pull it into our spiritual walk with God out of the message perfect strength and perfect weakness and he would say it in this way he said you know he said many times he said with your child would come and they've got a test to take he said how how fitting it would be to get them together and just pray with them say you know what let let's approach God Amen you know what I'm talking about I mean there's you know you you as parents will help out we'll help our children we'll you know do different things but we can't go and sit down in the desk or anymore they go on a computer and take a test and we we can't be there and do it I mean sister Mercy you work in that room over there at the college and you know parents can't go in there I've walked my boys over there and sister mercy and I wave through the window and you know when I had to drive them to school and they go in there and test and so forth and you're out there praying Lord give them wisdom Lord help them Lord to bring things back to their mind and and things like that but let me just sh let me share you this maybe as this would go along the one thing I've prayed with the boys and I've just looked at it from from my my journey what what I prayed for and actually where this come from was when God first got a hold my life I heard the Bisal say something he said you know may God help our young people to only go in and God only allow them to gather what needs to be gathered for what they need to do in life don't let them Gather in all the other junk and in this day and age we can say in Amen to that Amen to that but but what I'll ask for is this because remember brother Brown tells us in key to the door that message he preaches he said there's a key to mathematics there's a key to music right I mean there's like that aha moment we have key to science key to this so the things the way that I the way that I've prayed for myself and then I pray with the boys and things is ask them God give them understanding in the ways that they need to understand I don't want them just to get A's on the test or B's on the test because you and I both know there's no doubt well I may don't want to say this because I don't know if anybody's got a surgery coming up or not I just don't want somebody who got all A's on a test I want somebody who had who knows what they're doing more than just book smarts cuz there's a lot of people that are book smart that are common sense dumb that's true I know that wasn't very you know maybe Pleasant or what more but it's truth you know what I'm talking about sometimes there's things that people are just too smart for their own good right then that's not how work Life Works life don't work like that of a book oh my let's preach now can we that's the same way it is with this right here it's not about being ever so book smart it's about the author of the book coming in and living his life through you and I he's the one that brings it's his intelligence that sets down in our life and then as the word of God it begins to find get place in our life and we begin to say a now I see what God was doing in Elijah a now I see what God was saying here a now I see see it don't take us away from the Bible the spirit of Truth brings us into the word it's God breathing understanding in our lives let me finish this quote brother BR said like this cuz I think it's fitting he says you know he said I would rather he said so many times he said I'd rather my boy I don't know how this happens but he said I'd rather my boy get a good decent F on his card now some of the young people in here listen to me now this don't tun me on now some of you like send me that quote on the thread Brother Sam but just watch the point the point the point I'd rather my boy get a good an F on his card to flunk than to know he got a straight A and cheated over it brother B goes on to say very next statement what we need is to lose our self and wholly depend upon the power of God you see what would be within that something that's not we know I've got achieve to this or I've got to move to this but see God's desire is even in our lives listen sometimes we've had good decent Fs in our spiritual walk failings I don't know if there's such a mark in school as an M mistake right sometimes we've got D's do it yourself right but God's desire is that he we would wholly depend on him that and Lord it's not something where God see in other words God isn't trying to give you and I all the answers when you go through a test or trial do you know what's taking place don't answer that because you you don't I don't either sometimes we don't even know we're in the midst of a test or trial right sometimes the first thing we which as a Believer we start looking at is there some way Lord that I'm missing the Mark I think that's a wonderful thing that's a quality of a Believer we don't want to walk around presuming oh oh pray for me this test or trial and it may not be a test or trial it may be correcting us right but there's one sure thing for sure if we'll turn every stone over and know Lord there's nothing in my heart there's nothing Lord that's against you then we can be certain of God and say Lord your grace is sufficient not only to lead me when I've been wrong and correct me but your grace is sufficient in the trial or the test that I'm in presently you see you can't get away from his grace when you recognize him his grace is a present attribute of himself my my my you love him okay let me try to let me try to round this part out because I'm not going to even get to where we are looking at here but let's just try to round this out so when it comes down to it this is where it comes to our glory is him remember what David said I in the psalm when he said Thou Art Thou Art my shield my glory the lifter of my head is that right let me just pull it with this in Jeremiah chapter n thus sayith the Lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the Mighty Man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me yes sir yes sir that I'm the Lord which exercise loving kindness judgment righteousness in the Earth for in these things I Delight saith the Lord so if there's any Glory it's in him amen we are what we are by the the grace of God we are his achievement you now you might look at that and say what does that have to do with pride when we as we staying in his presence and let that ever be the anthem of our life that it's him he's the one that's done the work he's the one that's doing the working and God brings us back to that place over and over to remind us why as we can see that and I tell you what it'll take take care of Pride remember we don't have to be sprayed with all sorts of let me kill this bug of pride no no no what God has to do we get in his presence and what he's already already put in US he'll bring out of us amen and let me just tell you something as a dove are you hearing me as a dove a dove has a natural oil on the inside and that oil on the inside Works its way to the outside and so any little bugs or anything she's picked up in her wings that oil on the inside will work its way to the outside and you know what it does it loosens the hold of those things on our life where does that cleansing come from from inside that dve where does that cleansing come from it comes from his life on the inside of you and I as we're dwelling in his life amen but sometimes our battle is because not that we willfully not that we would just kind of turn away from but Satan's desire is to always snare us and try to bring us back down into that place let me I'm closing I'm just going to stop here no matter where a person is in their walk with God no matter where you might be in your walk with God it's always in that place that Lord let me keep my my eyes on you because listen it's not by might nor by power it's by my spirit saith the Lord God never intends you within a service listen we want to examine our lives right but I don't want to examine my life apart from the word because when I'm examining all right now stay with me now just a minute examining my life with the word I want to examine it with the spirit of love that it came in I want to examine it because remember he's not come to cast me down he's come as I can examine examine through his eyes and I can see my shortcomings I can see my weaknesses and what he's calling me to be you see God don't come in a service and just make known weaknesses and shortcomings but he shows us this is what I've called you to be and really what he's doing Brother Carlos is showing us what he's called us to be it shows up our weaknesses it shows where we're living beneath our privileges by showing us who we are where we need to be living and so when we examine it with that same love that he's brought it in and spoken it there's Grace that accompanies that our everything can be brought BR in line our hearts can be brought in line to say yes Lord be it unto me according to Thy word Lord I Surrender Lord I I submit myself to you Lord I give myself to you Lord Lord I I just want to I want to fall more in love with you Lord maybe you're sitting here today Lord go through every door of my life go through every room of my life Lord let my life be decorated with the grace of almighty God I don't want this furniture in my life that speaks a failure I don't want this furniture and these things I want what you supplied Lord to be in my life Hallelujah Israel never had to supply the furniture for the Tabernacle God himself self knew what furniture he wanted in the Tabernacle and God knows what he wants in your life and everything in your life is to speak of him and of his glory he is our righteousness he is your sanctification he is your all in all he is your wisdom he is your rapture he is your deliverance he is everything he everywhere Hallelujah everywhere I look all around I see Jesus Hallelujah in my life I go in this room I see Jesus I go here I see Jesus this seems like it's a theme Hallelujah through your house it is cuz he is the theme of the whole Bible amen Jesus Christ is the theme of it all the theme of my life the theme of your life is Jesus Christ in him will I glory in him will I Glory musicians will you come maybe play that song He's the glory and the lifter of my head he's everything to me let him be everything if he's if he's not listen friends even in every area I'll just let me just say it like this in every area of our life I think it's a very very powerful thing let me just let me just say it like this I think it was a very powerful thing last Sunday I I tell you my my heart you know what it's so powerful is that God can come down and our hearts would be moved sometimes sometimes in our minds I might be a little ahead of myself but sometimes in our minds we we almost get to thinking just coming to the Altar and I'm not trying to bring you to the altar I'm just saying sometimes we feel like coming to an altar is all about oh somebody's a sinner I you know I don't come to the altar because I'm a sinner I come to the altar there's sometimes coming to the altar I just want to say thank you well brother Samuel I can say thank you I know I know I know we can say thank you in our seat but sometimes I come to the Altar and say Lord I need another I need more of your grace so it isn't about the altar isn't just a place well brother Samuel it's a place of dying I agree and I'm still dying to me Lord am is that all right I'm still dying to self but you see when it all comes down to it everything that's within our life no matter where no matter what it is he's the glory of our life life I begin to just just pour over a lot of these things looking at it I know God's mindful friends yes he is I know God's mindful that we would look and consider that that part lord it's because of you it's you in me it's God's desire to live his own life through you amen and if there's any anything that sometimes we like I said sometimes we can't find out if there's any hindrance we don't just walk around and say man I wonder if I got a hindrance but our just staying in that place and that Fellowship sometimes we can feel you know what I'm talking about you can feel when things are a little bit out of line anybody know I'm talking about I know it ain't just me you can kind of feel that you say Lord what is it and sometimes it isn't anything outside of we really haven't got into his presence right well brother brother Samuel I prayed but but sometimes sometimes sometimes our prayer is on a schedule God doesn't want to fit into our schedule and he doesn't want neither does he want to add pressure to your life you see he don't want it to be oh I got to pray no listen you can talk with him at all times Hallelujah you can talk with him at all times I mean sometimes in throughout prayer sometimes prayer you know sometimes I might pray might it might be something you just pray just few minutes here then a few minutes down the road then a few minutes there and a few minutes there and then there's times there's times where we have extended time in prayer is that right but then there's other times just kind of you're going down and maybe 10 minutes here and 10 minutes but but something from your heart you know it's something even in the little times it's something from your heart that Lord I just got to steal away I got to tell you I love you I'm thinking about you right now I'm thinking about your goodness Lord I'm think think about where you brought me from amen you're talking about putting Pride out Lord I'm thinking about what you've done in my life I'm thinking about where you brought me from hallelujah oh glory be to God let me tell you something friends the blood of Jesus Christ has come yes Amen to relieve you and I from Pride to give us great to walk in this hour to where the judgment is between us and Christ there the word is coming and here we are the love of God is coming to discern Our Lives thank you and we're surrendering and submitting thank you Jesus in love to him don't you love him listen just just let him every time when he speaks to your heart just say Lord I'm looking to you I examine My Life by the love of God through the word and the Grace that's given to be what you've called me to be Lord be it unto me according to Thy word you know what Mary was asking let thy thoughts be made manifest in me what you thought about it let it be manifest in my life Hallelujah you watch everything things as things just continue to go through our lives things change attitudes change come on Friends he continues to mold and shape our character the way that God Saves a Life sanctifies a life fills it with the Holy Ghost and molds it with his precious life from the inside right is a work that is very similar in nature it's all yielding it's all yielding are you hearing me there's a product that God has in mind but everything is yielding yielding that's the key can you say that with me yielding yielding I know we we we pass signs out here on the road people don't read them n yield on the highway means go fast so I can get in front of you that's what yield means I don't think that's just uranians but I that's just you know what I'm saying but but this is where got thing can you see how little things like that can just get in yep and yet what yield really means it means surrender y means hold back that's what yield is Lord you go ahead show me the way show me thy way Lord show me where I need to put my footsteps down lord that's humility that's overcoming Pride oh my Hallelujah let's just let's just go to him in a word of prayer amen Heavenly Father Lord throughout this assembly this gather in here this morning Lord of your children you know every heart you know each life you know every need God you're mindful Lord of just exactly where we might be in our walk with you now father the greatest desire in our hearts that Lord no matter where each life is at that God that if there's anything at all any hindrance Lord of of Pride or anything Lord where it's got our eyes as though this is something that we have to do or got our eyes as though that it's something that we have done God I pray that Lord right here this morning may we take of the grace of God and Lord Jesus cast those thoughts aside and recognize Lord that it's you we are your workmanship it's what you are making out of our life we are your masterpieces Lord we are father what the holy spirit is bringing forth and brooding out of our own lives Lord so father our desire is more of you Hallelujah wonders our head is bowed we can say Lord I want to put off that old man and I want to sink more I I want to sink more into the Garment of redemption put on the new man I want to sink more into it you might say brother samel I've got this in my life what what would I do sink more just sink more into him just sink more into him and and watch as you sink into him amen him Lord Jesus granted Lord I pray father throughout this building Lord God we take lord of the grace of God in our lives Lord this morning Lord throughout in our journey it's it's continuing putting off of that old conversation Lord that old character and you bring us into certain situations that cause us to surrender to you when I read lord of the Prophet standing there in that pen with the bull I don't just read a story amen but I read an example of where you would bring every one of us as Sons and Daughters of God there's places like the prophet said if ID have known that bull was in that was in that place I have not went in there in another place as he tells us he left his gun in the truck he said if i' had that gun with me I'd have shot that bull cuz it had just killed a man but you SE to it he was in a situation and he didn't have the resources he was used to leaning on Father how you bring us into situations in our lives with your Infinite Wisdom that we maybe don't have the gun or something Lord to able to lean on but Lord will you bring us to a place to say I'm the shoulder for you to lean on I'm your strength I'm the one that right here to mold and make make myself more real to you and through your life granted Lord I pray this morning Lord throughout this building different Hearts and Hands Lord you know you know every one of us Lord oh yes father I pray God Hallelujah Lord no matter what the need might be Lord Jesus maybe some Lord may be struggling with something I don't know Lord God you know what it might be it might be something Lord maybe it's Lord mind battles maybe it's things Lord that father they find Lord maybe in their character maybe it's something Lord is struggling with a besetting sin maybe it's something Lord in a life that Lord is still struggling with certain habits Lord and and certain things in her life God I pray may they not look and be focused on the habits but may they sink deeper into you Lord the habits themselves is not what you want us to focus on it only lets us know you need to go deeper my daughter you need to go deeper my son there's a deeper walk for you and me there's a deeper place where those things you won't have to worry about them no more matter of fact they won't even be in your mind won't even torment you it will no longer be you trying not to it will just simply be me living through you Lord God grant it if every one of our lives through our character through our life Lord continue to mold us Lord more and more like you help us Lord you know each and every life every heart father in the
