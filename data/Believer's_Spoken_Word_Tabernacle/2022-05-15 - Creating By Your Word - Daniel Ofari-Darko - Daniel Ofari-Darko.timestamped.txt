[51:14] land
[51:15] say unto the lord and work
[51:18] for i am with you
[51:20] sayer the lord of hosts
[51:22] according to the word that i covenanted
[51:25] with you when you came out of egypt
[51:28] so my spirit remaineth among you
[51:32] fear ye not
[51:33] for thus saith the lord of hosts
[51:37] yet once
[51:38] it is a little while and i will shake

[51:43] and the sea
[51:44] in a dry land

[52:03] the glory of this little house shall be
[52:05] greater than of the former say the lord
[52:08] of hosts and in this place will i give
[52:11] peace say it the lord of hosts
[52:14] amen
[52:18] this morning we want to speak on the
[52:20] topic creating by your word
[52:25] creating
[52:26] by your word
[52:29] last thursday we spoke on look
[52:32] on jesus
[52:34] and when you look on jesus
[52:37] in all things you are able to do
[52:40] everything
[52:42] with with him all things are possible
[52:45] that if you don't doubt whatever you ask
[52:48] you have it
[52:50] amen so this morning we want to do
[52:52] something like the part two with this
[52:54] topic creating
[52:57] by your
[52:58] word
[53:00] and we know the bible
[53:02] have told us
[53:03] and we believe
[53:06] that words are spirits
[53:10] and uh
[53:12] therefore we christians
[53:15] especially we must be always careful the
[53:18] things that come
[53:20] out from our mouth
[53:23] i pray that the lord will help me that
[53:26] anytime something will come out from my
[53:28] mouth it will be a waste of blessings
[53:33] because you say whoever you bless the
[53:35] person will be blessed and whoever you
[53:37] care the person will be cursed
[53:39] i want to bless
[53:41] and keep on blessing
[53:42] hallelujah
[53:44] so anything that we say we have to be
[53:47] careful because it is wet it can create
[53:52] in the beginning
[53:54] it was god's word that created
[53:58] and everything that we see in existence
[54:01] was created by god by god
[54:05] he said let there be and there was
[54:07] in fact
[54:09] science science
[54:10] or for that matter yes signs sometimes
[54:13] tell us of certain years that this world
[54:17] has been in existence
[54:19] of which
[54:21] by our revolution
[54:23] it's quite different
[54:25] but well they say it and they say it
[54:27] anyhow
[54:28] but what i want to say is that
[54:31] nobody can determine how long our god
[54:34] was in existence
[54:36] before one day he got up and he said let
[54:39] there be and there was
[54:43] it was his word
[54:46] that he used to create everything
[54:48] and the bible said that after his
[54:50] creation that he created man also
[54:53] and he created man in his image
[54:57] so you could look to adam and you can
[54:59] see god
[55:00] and you look to god and you can see adam
[55:03] that was the condition
[55:06] and god gave every power to adam
[55:09] hallelujah
[55:10] adam kulaf
[55:12] in those power he can tell
[55:15] these three i don't i don't like where
[55:18] you are situated be removed
[55:20] and go to the other side
[55:22] and those creatures has to obey
[55:26] because he had that creative power
[55:28] within him
[55:30] hallelujah
[55:31] and so that was how god you know the
[55:34] condition that god put man he gave him
[55:37] so much power to do whatever and you
[55:40] know
[55:40] that adam was the one even that named
[55:42] all the creation
[55:46] from the trees to the animals and the
[55:49] fowls in the air and the falls on the
[55:51] ground every creature
[55:54] adam was given the power to name them
[55:56] and while he was naming them he looked
[55:59] around and you saw
[56:01] the names that would fit them
[56:04] and he gave them
[56:05] exactly
[56:07] hallelujah because he was in the image
[56:09] of god
[56:10] now
[56:12] but that fellowship
[56:14] god broke him when man
[56:18] left the word of god
[56:20] because that ability and power that god
[56:22] gave to him all was based
[56:25] on the word
[56:27] because in the beginning was the word
[56:29] and the word was with god and the word
[56:32] was god
[56:33] and the bible said that there was
[56:35] nothing made without that word
[56:39] so the power that god gave to adam was
[56:43] based on the word
[56:46] but when sin entered into god the garden
[56:50] that power
[56:51] was taken from him
[56:54] the power of creation and so man became
[56:57] so miserable
[56:59] can you imagine
[57:01] that today you live in america
[57:03] where the whole world everybody think
[57:05] that america is a super country is that
[57:08] not it
[57:09] and sometimes you americans even think
[57:10] like that
[57:13] that you are super country yes because
[57:15] everything is so accessible
[57:19] will you be happy
[57:21] that they will tell you that get out
[57:23] from america and go and stay or live in
[57:26] one of this poorest country in this
[57:28] world will you be happy about that
[57:30] i don't think you'll be happy
[57:32] so that day when sin caused god to move
[57:35] down from the garden adam became so
[57:37] miserable
[57:39] because his power was taken from him
[57:42] the god said that you will tell the
[57:44] ground before you feed
[57:45] so it means previously he was not doing
[57:48] that
[57:49] and so adam became so miserable
[57:52] he was put into some condition that he
[57:54] didn't like but there was nothing you
[57:56] could do
[57:58] but brother sister have you thought it
[58:01] that
[58:02] when adam was in that condition
[58:04] god himself was also not happy oh yes
[58:09] because god didn't create a damn to be
[58:12] in that condition
[58:15] but it was a little disobedient that
[58:17] caused him to everybody every evening
[58:19] god went to the garden to have
[58:20] fellowship with adam
[58:22] and so that fellowship got broken you
[58:25] think god was happy
[58:26] no
[58:27] he wasn't
[58:29] that is why right from that day
[58:32] he started looking for how he can
[58:35] restore that fellowship back
[58:42] he searched and look
[58:44] and plan
[58:45] he said no i will restore this
[58:47] fellowship back
[58:49] because i am not happy
[58:53] the reason why
[58:56] when
[58:57] a brother or a sister
[59:00] don't come to church
[59:02] for no reason
[59:05] the reason why we are not happy is that
[59:07] we want to have fellowship
[59:10] it is fellowship that is the reason why
[59:12] we come together
[59:16] and god is very happy when we come
[59:20] together
[59:21] because we fellowship with ourselves and
[59:24] with him
[59:27] are you catching it so from that from
[59:30] then he he
[59:32] he found a way to restore that
[59:36] and one day
[59:38] there was a man called abraham
[59:40] who was living in his father's home
[59:44] well people say well
[59:46] we know that they were not christian
[59:49] but god called him out
[59:51] of his kingdom
[59:53] say abraham
[59:54] come out
[59:56] i am going to show you a place
[1:00:00] come up from your people
[1:00:02] and god pull him out
[1:00:05] and when god pull him out we all know
[1:00:07] the condition of abraham and his wife
[1:00:10] they lived
[1:00:11] without a child
[1:00:13] but god put faith in abraham
[1:00:16] when he pulled him out
[1:00:19] hallelujah
[1:00:20] the reason was that god was still
[1:00:22] finding a way to restore that broken
[1:00:25] fellowship again
[1:00:28] and he he saw the qualities of one
[1:00:32] in
[1:00:33] abraham of ramadan he was called abraham
[1:00:36] he said come from among your people and
[1:00:39] abram came up from his people
[1:00:43] but one day
[1:00:47] whenever i move out
[1:00:50] people will wonder where are you going
[1:00:55] he took his wife
[1:00:59] his you know
[1:01:02] workers
[1:01:04] and the bible say that his nephew
[1:01:07] lot also
[1:01:09] went with him
[1:01:11] but god didn't call lot
[1:01:17] but lord went with
[1:01:20] abraham
[1:01:22] now
[1:01:23] we know that when they got to a place
[1:01:27] there was tension between abram
[1:01:30] servants and that of lords because their
[1:01:34] animals were
[1:01:36] increasing
[1:01:38] now abraham didn't like it
[1:01:40] so he called us a lot
[1:01:42] i think our
[1:01:44] our cattles and our ships are getting so
[1:01:47] much so badly the way the servants are
[1:01:49] behaving separate yourself if you go to
[1:01:52] the west i'll go to the north if you go
[1:01:54] to the north i'll go to the south
[1:01:55] whichever way you want
[1:01:56] the bible said that lord look
[1:02:00] to the place towards sodom where the
[1:02:03] vegetation was green
[1:02:04] because of his he didn't think that oh
[1:02:06] my my uncle is this mossino so he should
[1:02:09] choose first
[1:02:12] in africa we don't do that in africa
[1:02:14] junior don't choose before seniors
[1:02:16] oh yes
[1:02:18] we don't do that when a sinner is there
[1:02:20] you're the young man no no no no wait
[1:02:22] let the sinner take first
[1:02:25] but lord chose first
[1:02:28] but it was not a border to abraham
[1:02:31] now when he went away we all know the
[1:02:34] story that came that some five nations
[1:02:36] came together and they beseeched sodom
[1:02:38] and gomorrah
[1:02:40] and lord was taken captive
[1:02:43] but one somebody ran escaped and came
[1:02:46] and told abraham this story
[1:02:49] abram said what
[1:02:51] look taken captive
[1:02:53] oh no
[1:02:54] i have to go and rescue lord
[1:02:57] so he organized the man 318 in his house
[1:03:02] they didn't have
[1:03:04] a military training they didn't have
[1:03:06] police training they didn't know anyone
[1:03:08] tatties
[1:03:09] but abraham said we are going to fight
[1:03:12] to rescue lord
[1:03:14] they went quiet all right
[1:03:16] and abraham the bible said that he
[1:03:19] divided these 380 men
[1:03:22] and they pursued these five nations
[1:03:24] they conquered them
[1:03:26] and they rescue lord and his family
[1:03:28] oh brother and when abraham was coming
[1:03:32] from the conqueror
[1:03:34] or from the conquest
[1:03:36] something happened on the way
[1:03:38] there was a man down next to him
[1:03:41] and the man's name was melchizedek
[1:03:46] oh up to today people don't know who
[1:03:48] mercedes was
[1:03:50] the intellectuals are always cracking
[1:03:53] their brains
[1:03:55] they don't know who my face attack was
[1:03:57] and you cannot know who mercy said that
[1:03:59] case when you don't have the holy spirit
[1:04:03] you say what is the holy spirit is he
[1:04:04] speaking in terms noble
[1:04:07] the holy spirit is god revealing himself
[1:04:10] to you in the dead that you are living
[1:04:12] in
[1:04:16] hallelujah
[1:04:17] and they will sit down and discuss about
[1:04:19] mercury and discuss about
[1:04:22] and and
[1:04:23] trying to flame whom my christian should
[1:04:26] be
[1:04:27] but thank god
[1:04:29] by the revelation of the word
[1:04:31] mercury was nobody but god the creator
[1:04:36] he had no beginning of days
[1:04:38] he had no ending of days he has no
[1:04:40] father he has no mother and the only one
[1:04:43] that qualified that is our god jehovah
[1:04:47] and everyone met him on the way
[1:04:50] and brother you know what he said
[1:04:52] abraham i am going to give you communion
[1:04:55] why will mercury give communion to
[1:04:58] abraham because abraham has become an
[1:05:01] overcomer
[1:05:03] he overcame his enemies
[1:05:06] and with love oh somebody would have
[1:05:09] said oh but after all that guy he
[1:05:11] himself chose that place so if he has
[1:05:15] been captured why should i bother
[1:05:17] somebody could say that
[1:05:19] but not
[1:05:20] abraham not abraham that is why no
[1:05:23] matter what somebody will do against you
[1:05:26] try and forgive
[1:05:29] i didn't hear amen there
[1:05:31] that one is not sweet at all
[1:05:35] no matter what anybody that will offend
[1:05:38] you i say according to the bible forgive
[1:05:41] the person
[1:05:44] i want to repeat that
[1:05:46] jesus said
[1:05:49] if you don't forgive anybody their sense
[1:05:52] do not think that your father in heaven
[1:05:54] also forgive your sins
[1:05:57] so whether you like it or not so long as
[1:06:00] you are a christian
[1:06:02] forgive everybody that trespasses
[1:06:04] against you
[1:06:05] don't say oh ask for this brother ask
[1:06:07] for their sister oh no don't go no don't
[1:06:10] do that
[1:06:11] abraham didn't do that
[1:06:13] and that pulled god out from his throne
[1:06:16] he said no the love that this man have
[1:06:18] shown let me go and encourage him
[1:06:22] so the prophet we pulled one of the one
[1:06:24] of the bodies and he jumped into it and
[1:06:26] came on this earth as a man melchizedek
[1:06:31] he was trying to restore faith
[1:06:33] and he restored faith in the life of
[1:06:35] abraham
[1:06:37] and he gave him communion
[1:06:39] and abraham said wow if you have given
[1:06:42] me communion let me also give you my
[1:06:44] tithes
[1:06:46] so there was a great fellowship between
[1:06:48] melchizedek and abraham
[1:06:51] and that is what god is restoring us
[1:06:53] back or he has restored his back to it
[1:06:56] and remember beloved
[1:06:59] methyl neck of the old testament
[1:07:01] is the lord jesus christ of this new
[1:07:04] testament
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:09] and now kissing with the creative power
[1:07:12] jesus christ also demonstrated it
[1:07:15] one day when he was walking around with
[1:07:18] these the disciples
[1:07:20] the bible say that
[1:07:21] they came upon a man
[1:07:24] that everybody knew that he was born
[1:07:26] blind
[1:07:28] and the disciple asked jesus
[1:07:30] master
[1:07:32] who did sin
[1:07:34] is this
[1:07:36] his own sin
[1:07:37] or the sin of the parents
[1:07:40] he was that was the mind that was the
[1:07:41] idea
[1:07:43] that when somebody is sick it means he
[1:07:45] has committed the sin
[1:07:47] sometimes it's a wrong judgment
[1:07:52] you remember the story of job
[1:07:55] when the friends were telling him that
[1:07:57] job we think that you are a secret
[1:07:59] sinner
[1:08:00] meanwhile didn't sin
[1:08:03] so when we have that conclusion on
[1:08:06] people we make wrong judgments
[1:08:10] so jesus christ told his disciples
[1:08:12] this man had not sinned
[1:08:15] neither the parents
[1:08:17] but this man was born blind so that the
[1:08:20] glory of god might be manifest
[1:08:23] oh hallelujah
[1:08:25] and here we are talking about fights
[1:08:28] so in this matter any condition that you
[1:08:30] have you found yourself oh give glory to
[1:08:33] god
[1:08:34] yeah sometimes i know it's hard to give
[1:08:35] glory but that is the word
[1:08:40] your situation
[1:08:42] if you handle it well you are going to
[1:08:44] bring glory to god
[1:08:48] amen that's what jesus said he said that
[1:08:50] the glory of god may be made manifest
[1:08:54] and after saying that
[1:08:56] the bible said that then his part on the
[1:08:58] ground
[1:09:00] and then out of the hospital
[1:09:02] he formed a clay
[1:09:04] and put those clay on the eye of the man
[1:09:09] oh
[1:09:11] wow
[1:09:13] who told jesus
[1:09:16] that that particular clay
[1:09:19] will be able to create new eye for the
[1:09:21] man
[1:09:23] who told jesus christ that
[1:09:26] the prophet said that human being will
[1:09:28] consist about 16 elements are not it so
[1:09:30] many peace were eyeing us but
[1:09:34] you can name them
[1:09:36] and i don't know the type of clay god
[1:09:40] used to create my nose
[1:09:44] i don't know the type of clay god yeast
[1:09:47] used to clear create my ear
[1:09:51] i don't know the type of clay he used to
[1:09:54] make my hair
[1:09:56] because he said that we were taken out
[1:09:58] of the dust is that what the bible say
[1:10:01] so i don't know the kind of varieties
[1:10:03] of clay that god used in forming us
[1:10:06] but that day because jesus christ he was
[1:10:09] a creator in the beginning he found out
[1:10:12] that that particular clay was the one
[1:10:14] that he used in creating the eye of the
[1:10:15] man
[1:10:18] so immediately
[1:10:20] he formed the clay out of his own spirit
[1:10:23] and anointed the eye of the man he said
[1:10:26] go and wash
[1:10:29] in the pool of cilia
[1:10:32] and the man went
[1:10:34] and washed his face
[1:10:37] and he saw
[1:10:39] whoa
[1:10:40] for the first time
[1:10:42] the man saw his own color
[1:10:45] whether it was white or black or green
[1:10:49] that was the first day the man saw his
[1:10:51] own color
[1:10:52] and the man was rejoicing
[1:10:54] people were asking is he not a blind man
[1:10:57] he said yes i am
[1:11:00] but remember i was
[1:11:03] oh hallelujah
[1:11:05] he was the blind man but now he is not
[1:11:10] it was out of the word of jesus christ
[1:11:14] he created again
[1:11:16] and today he can create again because
[1:11:18] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:11:20] forever
[1:11:23] oh
[1:11:24] this should have brought celebration to
[1:11:26] the whole people
[1:11:28] some were rejoicing
[1:11:30] but some were annoying
[1:11:32] some were so confused some were so angry
[1:11:36] why should this man
[1:11:38] get his eyes back
[1:11:41] and most of today is a sabbath day
[1:11:44] why
[1:11:45] and that was a question from the
[1:11:46] pharisee
[1:11:49] they took this man
[1:11:50] to their council
[1:11:53] and they asked me
[1:11:54] he asked him
[1:11:56] who opened your eyes
[1:11:59] he said
[1:12:00] somebody called jesus
[1:12:02] he said what is he i don't i don't know
[1:12:04] where he is
[1:12:05] because everyone who was speaking to me
[1:12:07] i was still blind
[1:12:10] they didn't believe the man
[1:12:12] so they called their parents
[1:12:14] to come
[1:12:15] and when the parents also came
[1:12:18] they also said well
[1:12:19] this is our son
[1:12:22] who we know he was born blind
[1:12:24] but as to how
[1:12:26] he can now
[1:12:28] see we don't know
[1:12:30] ask him
[1:12:31] after all is more than 30 years
[1:12:35] the bible said that their parents said
[1:12:37] that today for a cease because
[1:12:40] they were afraid
[1:12:44] there was a warning
[1:12:46] that if you believe in the lord jesus
[1:12:47] christ they will just communicate you
[1:12:48] from the church
[1:12:51] so all of them were careful
[1:12:54] so they turn again to the man and they
[1:12:56] ask him
[1:12:57] give god the glory
[1:13:00] but they didn't know that the man had
[1:13:02] already given god the glory
[1:13:04] they wanted it again he said but i've
[1:13:06] already told you
[1:13:08] do you want to hear it again or perhaps
[1:13:10] you want to become his disciples also
[1:13:14] and if god
[1:13:15] for us is mad he said who tell you that
[1:13:18] we want to be his disciple we are muslim
[1:13:21] disciples
[1:13:23] after that man we don't know where he
[1:13:24] came from
[1:13:26] oh
[1:13:28] you don't know where he came from
[1:13:30] and he has opened my eye
[1:13:33] are you not the same people who teach us
[1:13:35] in the in the church
[1:13:37] that god don't listen to a sinner
[1:13:40] if this man is not of god he wouldn't
[1:13:42] have opened my eyes
[1:13:46] and they said
[1:13:48] so what do you make out of him
[1:13:51] it's a question they asked him
[1:13:54] then the man looked on them with
[1:13:56] boldness he said he is the prophet
[1:13:59] hallelujah
[1:14:01] listen what
[1:14:03] you want to teach us
[1:14:06] you want to teach us
[1:14:09] you think we don't know our letters
[1:14:12] and you want to teach us who the prophet
[1:14:14] is
[1:14:14] this man cannot be a prophet
[1:14:18] the man look at them in his life
[1:14:20] he said well
[1:14:22] whether you believe it or not
[1:14:26] whether he is a prophet or not
[1:14:29] whether he is an illegitimate child or
[1:14:31] not there is only one thing that i know
[1:14:33] that once a time i was blind but now i
[1:14:38] can see
[1:14:40] oh hallelujah
[1:14:42] and that's certain things
[1:14:44] whether you like it or not brother
[1:14:46] sister whether the world believe it or
[1:14:48] not there is a message on this hour
[1:14:53] and that message is preparing us to meet
[1:14:55] our lord jesus christ
[1:14:58] anything aside from that is a
[1:15:00] news
[1:15:04] like how my brother richard used to say
[1:15:07] hallelujah anything aside from this
[1:15:11] message
[1:15:12] i say is strength
[1:15:16] and that was the stand of the man
[1:15:18] whether you believe it or not he didn't
[1:15:20] care he said once i was blind but now i
[1:15:24] can see
[1:15:26] and that was the ultimate
[1:15:29] and that day
[1:15:32] on mount camel
[1:15:34] when the whole israel
[1:15:36] has fallen into total confusion
[1:15:40] like how the world is in confusion today
[1:15:44] they didn't know the right church to
[1:15:46] attend
[1:15:47] they didn't know the right god to
[1:15:49] believe
[1:15:51] and elijah said
[1:15:53] now
[1:15:55] get me over here
[1:15:59] there will not be any rain
[1:16:01] on this earth
[1:16:03] because of your sin
[1:16:05] because of your unbelief
[1:16:07] hallelujah
[1:16:08] because of the peace yeah you are doing
[1:16:10] worshiping by
[1:16:12] there will never be rain on this earth
[1:16:16] until i call it
[1:16:19] and the moment elijah said that god
[1:16:21] locked the heavens
[1:16:23] no rain
[1:16:25] and the whole place that was farming
[1:16:30] every place that was farming
[1:16:33] people were going hungry without food
[1:16:35] there was no water to drink
[1:16:38] until god
[1:16:39] even this thing affected elijah himself
[1:16:44] and god said well this is my servant
[1:16:48] come come come come come over
[1:16:51] get to that woman over there
[1:16:53] and he she will take care of you
[1:16:57] initially ravens were given elijah bread
[1:17:01] i don't know where the god i don't know
[1:17:02] what the the they have what they have
[1:17:04] ovens in their homes
[1:17:07] and they prepared pizza
[1:17:10] and they supplied elijah and that i was
[1:17:13] enjoying it
[1:17:14] until this verse was no more coming
[1:17:16] god said go to that woman we know that
[1:17:18] story i don't want you to take too much
[1:17:20] time over there
[1:17:21] but then after
[1:17:23] the end of that prophecy
[1:17:27] era was looking all over the place in
[1:17:30] searching of elijah and you all know
[1:17:32] what to be found
[1:17:34] until then makes him
[1:17:36] he said yes go and tell your master
[1:17:38] today i will show myself to him
[1:17:42] he should call all the vast prophets
[1:17:47] let them meet me
[1:17:49] on mount carmel
[1:17:51] we want to see
[1:17:53] whose weight
[1:17:54] can create
[1:17:59] and they assembled
[1:18:01] back prophets here prophet elijah here
[1:18:04] and the whole israel becoming spectators
[1:18:07] on the stadium
[1:18:10] elijah said well we are going to call on
[1:18:12] our god
[1:18:15] the god that is god of israel
[1:18:18] he should answer with fire
[1:18:22] upon the orders that we are going to
[1:18:24] ban
[1:18:26] nobody should put fire inside
[1:18:28] they say agreed
[1:18:30] elijah said well you are many i am alone
[1:18:33] so you do yours first
[1:18:35] and they did whatever they want to do
[1:18:38] and the bow prophet started to chant
[1:18:42] they started to do the all time way that
[1:18:44] they used to chant calling on their
[1:18:46] idols bowel to answer they called and
[1:18:50] called and called and called so many
[1:18:53] hours there was no answer coming from
[1:18:55] that
[1:18:56] then the prophet elijah started kissing
[1:18:58] them he said hey
[1:19:01] shout shout shout because maybe
[1:19:04] baal is going to buy something at target
[1:19:07] call
[1:19:08] shall shout out
[1:19:10] and they shouted and shouted and shouted
[1:19:14] no response from baal elijah will come
[1:19:17] and look at them he said are you tired
[1:19:19] more vigorous more vigor continue to
[1:19:22] shout maybe he has moved from target to
[1:19:25] walmart
[1:19:26] sharp
[1:19:27] sharp and they were shouting and
[1:19:29] shouting and shouting and shouting
[1:19:32] bar was nowhere to be found in fact the
[1:19:34] bible said that they cut themselves with
[1:19:36] knives
[1:19:38] until blood began to oath on their body
[1:19:43] but they realized that
[1:19:45] they could not
[1:19:46] brother
[1:19:47] do you know why
[1:19:50] not that the bad prophet
[1:19:52] didn't know that buck will answer them
[1:19:55] because they have been doing it always
[1:19:59] and they know that their god answers
[1:20:02] them
[1:20:04] so they knew they were positive that bad
[1:20:06] will respond
[1:20:08] but that day
[1:20:10] while they were calling there was
[1:20:12] another power standing on the mountain
[1:20:15] which was the presence of elijah
[1:20:17] and by then not come to that mountain
[1:20:21] oh brother says you see the power of the
[1:20:24] believer
[1:20:26] you see the power of the believer
[1:20:29] that is why when god called you he said
[1:20:31] fear not
[1:20:33] sometimes
[1:20:34] believers
[1:20:35] we allow certain situations
[1:20:38] to put our faith from us
[1:20:41] we become so deflected because of some
[1:20:44] trouble we become so confused we begin
[1:20:47] to ask ourselves questions
[1:20:49] am i a true believer yes you are a true
[1:20:52] believer
[1:20:55] hallelujah
[1:20:57] bow recognize that the presence of god
[1:21:00] has come on the mountain how will he go
[1:21:02] there will you
[1:21:03] you dare not
[1:21:05] and
[1:21:06] run away
[1:21:09] brother
[1:21:10] then elijah told them that
[1:21:12] hey it's enough
[1:21:16] you are losing blood too much
[1:21:19] and the doctors and the nurses are here
[1:21:20] they will tell you
[1:21:22] when you lose blood too much you die
[1:21:26] and elijah that they feathered them he
[1:21:28] said it's enough i don't want you to die
[1:21:30] here but i'm going to show you how you
[1:21:32] are going to die
[1:21:35] he packed them aside
[1:21:38] and now the bible said that he prepared
[1:21:41] the altar
[1:21:43] with 12 stones
[1:21:45] representing the 12th tribe of israel
[1:21:49] and he killed the sacrifice
[1:21:52] and played the sacrifice upon the altar
[1:21:54] and he requested for 12 barrels of water
[1:21:59] four
[1:22:00] four four to watch the sacrifice
[1:22:04] and he
[1:22:05] created a trend
[1:22:07] around the sacrifice
[1:22:09] and he said lord
[1:22:12] my lord
[1:22:14] i have done this
[1:22:16] according to your word
[1:22:20] therefore
[1:22:21] glorify yourself
[1:22:22] by bringing fire
[1:22:24] down upon the earth
[1:22:27] before he said amen
[1:22:29] bomb
[1:22:30] fire
[1:22:35] and the fire of god
[1:22:39] blended the sacrifice
[1:22:42] paint everything on it
[1:22:44] and the water that have you know
[1:22:47] surrounded the altar the fire lit all
[1:22:52] see that is why when we come to the lord
[1:22:54] jesus christ we don't give
[1:22:56] half of our body to the lord
[1:22:58] and keep half to ourselves
[1:23:00] we give our body all
[1:23:03] so that when he is washing us he will
[1:23:06] wash all our body when he is filling up
[1:23:08] with the power you will feel everything
[1:23:10] that is enough
[1:23:12] perfect
[1:23:15] then
[1:23:17] all the rejoicing
[1:23:19] now they were praising god that indeed
[1:23:22] jehovah god is their god
[1:23:26] elijah said well
[1:23:28] don't let any of the bad prophet
[1:23:32] escape kill them
[1:23:35] kill them
[1:23:37] elijah make them kill all of them
[1:23:41] because they were unbelievers
[1:23:44] because they were adult worshipers
[1:23:46] because they loved the kings of the
[1:23:47] world
[1:23:48] and today we have got that power that
[1:23:51] same power to kill every unbelief in our
[1:23:54] lives
[1:23:55] anything that goes contrary to the word
[1:23:57] of god we kill it
[1:23:59] by our word
[1:24:02] elijah spoke the word
[1:24:03] and today we have the word to speak it
[1:24:05] out
[1:24:06] and to begin to create
[1:24:09] your word can create the atmosphere that
[1:24:12] you want to be in
[1:24:14] hallelujah
[1:24:17] amen and amen according to his word
[1:24:20] he created it
[1:24:22] and according to your word you can
[1:24:24] create it also today
[1:24:27] can you say amen here
[1:24:29] yes brother i want you to believe that
[1:24:31] before i continue sister i want you to
[1:24:33] believe that before i continue
[1:24:35] i say your word can create an atmosphere
[1:24:38] for you the atmosphere that you want to
[1:24:40] be in
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:48] when the lord
[1:24:50] brought deliverance of adam to salvation
[1:24:53] to israel in egypt
[1:24:56] we know how
[1:24:58] uh moses i'm sorry a pharaoh
[1:25:02] started to prove some kind of
[1:25:03] stubbornness
[1:25:05] until
[1:25:06] he had the gas to ask moses who is that
[1:25:10] god hey
[1:25:13] you want to know the god of moses
[1:25:16] then moses
[1:25:18] said aaron cast the road on the ground
[1:25:22] and aaron cuts the road on the ground
[1:25:26] and the road turned to be serpent snake
[1:25:29] then they started laughing
[1:25:31] genius and generous
[1:25:33] because they know how to do it magically
[1:25:37] but moses didn't command that magic
[1:25:42] moses
[1:25:44] was divine declaration
[1:25:47] that god is able to do anything that he
[1:25:50] wants
[1:25:54] hallelujah he is the generator of
[1:25:57] diversity
[1:25:58] the g.o.d generator of diversity he can
[1:26:01] do anything that he wants
[1:26:05] can you say amen
[1:26:07] so when he put the road on the ground
[1:26:09] and genesis and generals came around
[1:26:11] they saw but this is a magical trick
[1:26:13] this wasn't the magical trick
[1:26:15] it was the power of god
[1:26:18] they also cast their rods on the ground
[1:26:20] and it turn into the same serpent
[1:26:23] perhaps bigger than that of moses
[1:26:27] but when
[1:26:30] power
[1:26:31] and power meet
[1:26:34] then we see the super power
[1:26:38] that is why the nations on this set
[1:26:41] number one nation fear number two
[1:26:43] number two fear number one number three
[1:26:46] number four number four fear number five
[1:26:49] they are all afraid of themselves
[1:26:51] but thank god
[1:26:53] i say thank god
[1:26:54] we are the sons and daughters of god
[1:26:57] we are taking this earth by force
[1:27:00] because the egg belongs to us hallelujah
[1:27:02] the system that is going on now we are
[1:27:05] pushing all away and we will inherit
[1:27:08] this earth
[1:27:09] and the above righteousness
[1:27:11] shall cover the face of this earth
[1:27:14] hallelujah as the waters cover the sea
[1:27:19] one venus and gem bridge also turned
[1:27:21] into road
[1:27:23] they were laughing
[1:27:24] but look at what happened
[1:27:26] moses
[1:27:28] road
[1:27:29] which attempted to be serpent raised his
[1:27:31] head
[1:27:32] and galloped
[1:27:34] that of genius
[1:27:35] and that of the embrace
[1:27:37] and that was their end
[1:27:41] you can't face god
[1:27:43] and he proves so much stubbornness and
[1:27:46] we know that 10th place that god struck
[1:27:48] on the land of egypt to destroy egypt
[1:27:51] until their first sons
[1:27:54] died
[1:27:56] now it was too much for pharaoh
[1:27:58] pharaoh said okay go i allow you now
[1:28:02] and israel
[1:28:03] set off
[1:28:06] the journey
[1:28:08] and they came
[1:28:11] to face
[1:28:12] the red feet
[1:28:15] now when they got to the red sea
[1:28:20] people started asking questions
[1:28:23] why
[1:28:25] where is the motorway
[1:28:27] or what is the freeway that we have to
[1:28:29] pass on
[1:28:31] they begin asking moses questions
[1:28:34] they were standing there when all of a
[1:28:36] sudden they saw
[1:28:38] pharaoh and his armies chasing them to
[1:28:41] the sea
[1:28:42] because pharaoh has decided that he had
[1:28:44] made a mistake
[1:28:45] he shouldn't have allowed israel to go
[1:28:47] so they were going to bring them back to
[1:28:49] egypt
[1:28:51] and israel started crying
[1:28:54] everybody was so much disturbed
[1:28:57] and they asked moses are there no graves
[1:28:59] in egypt
[1:29:01] that you have brought us here to die now
[1:29:03] who told you that you are going to die
[1:29:07] because they saw the chariot and the
[1:29:09] horsemen of pharaoh are
[1:29:11] approaching them they became so confused
[1:29:15] beloved i don't want you to be in that
[1:29:17] condition
[1:29:18] anytime in your life
[1:29:21] can you say amen
[1:29:22] anytime you see any situation coming
[1:29:24] your way stand
[1:29:27] and let your word create
[1:29:32] let your word change the atmosphere
[1:29:36] for what you say that is what will
[1:29:38] manifest
[1:29:40] hallelujah
[1:29:42] get disturbed moses and they say moses
[1:29:44] why have you brought us here now look at
[1:29:47] pharaoh and his men they are coming to
[1:29:48] destroy us
[1:29:52] but thank god
[1:29:54] before the soldiers
[1:29:56] would get to where the israelites was
[1:29:59] god came down in the pillar of fire
[1:30:02] to become a block
[1:30:03] between them and so the photos suggest
[1:30:07] we're not able to cross over to attack
[1:30:08] them
[1:30:09] they didn't know that god was going to
[1:30:11] do something like that
[1:30:13] hallelujah that is what the believer
[1:30:16] must always live by faith
[1:30:23] they cried and cried and cried
[1:30:27] until moses himself
[1:30:30] oh
[1:30:32] oh god why why have you allowed pharaoh
[1:30:36] and and his people to ac to chase us
[1:30:39] again oh god moses
[1:30:43] and brother
[1:30:45] if you don't take time
[1:30:48] somebody will influence you wrongly
[1:30:54] what is what was not in the position to
[1:30:55] cry
[1:30:57] because he
[1:30:59] met that pillar of fire
[1:31:02] and he has a witness
[1:31:05] two signs
[1:31:07] so you cannot tell moses that there is
[1:31:10] no god
[1:31:11] because he met him
[1:31:13] and when he asked him what is your name
[1:31:15] he said i am that i am
[1:31:19] but look he allowed the people
[1:31:22] he allowed the congregation
[1:31:25] to cause him also to cry
[1:31:30] what
[1:31:31] did god tell him let's see
[1:31:34] genesis chapter 14
[1:31:36] i'm sorry exodus
[1:31:38] chapter 14
[1:31:41] and verse
[1:31:42] 10. are you with me
[1:31:45] i hope nobody is sleeping
[1:31:49] here we worship god we don't sleep okay
[1:31:52] great
[1:31:54] example chapter 14
[1:31:57] and verse number 10
[1:32:00] and when pharaoh
[1:32:02] drew nine
[1:32:04] the children of israel lifted up their
[1:32:06] eyes
[1:32:07] and behold
[1:32:09] the egyptians
[1:32:10] matched after them
[1:32:13] and they were so afraid of mine
[1:32:16] and the children of israel cried out
[1:32:18] unto the lord
[1:32:19] and they said unto moses
[1:32:22] because there were no graves in egypt
[1:32:25] has all taken us away to die
[1:32:29] in the wilderness
[1:32:30] wherefore has that dealt us with us
[1:32:34] to cry to carry us forth out of egypt
[1:32:38] it not this the word that we tell thee
[1:32:42] in egypt
[1:32:43] saying let us alone
[1:32:45] that we may serve the egyptians
[1:32:49] for it
[1:32:50] better for us to serve the egyptians
[1:32:53] then that we should die in the
[1:32:55] wilderness
[1:32:57] verse 13
[1:32:59] and moses said unto the people
[1:33:02] fear ye not
[1:33:04] stand still
[1:33:06] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:33:08] which he will show to you today for the
[1:33:11] egyptians whom ye have seen today yeah
[1:33:14] shall see them again no more forever
[1:33:19] hallelujah
[1:33:20] those troubles that you think is your
[1:33:22] trouble you will not see them again
[1:33:27] those things
[1:33:29] those difficulties
[1:33:30] those enemies you will not see them
[1:33:32] again
[1:33:34] honestly
[1:33:36] according to the word of god
[1:33:39] verse 14
[1:33:41] the lord shall fight for you
[1:33:43] and ye shall hold your peace
[1:33:46] and the lord sat unto moses
[1:33:48] wherefore cries down unto me
[1:33:51] speak unto the children of israel that
[1:33:54] they go forward
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:01] speak unto the children of israel
[1:34:03] they'll go forward
[1:34:06] there is no turning back
[1:34:09] we are going forward
[1:34:11] whether the wealth straighten up or not
[1:34:13] we are going forward
[1:34:16] the one that you repent or not we are
[1:34:18] going forward
[1:34:20] amen with that sickness or disease we
[1:34:23] are going forward
[1:34:26] and that was god what god told moses
[1:34:29] he said why are you crying
[1:34:31] this is not a time of crying
[1:34:33] but go forward in fact
[1:34:39] and they went forward
[1:34:43] and when they went forward
[1:34:46] the impossibility
[1:34:48] that was in the mind of most of the
[1:34:50] people
[1:34:53] it became possible
[1:34:56] they didn't know
[1:34:58] that
[1:35:00] the recipe was going to be parted
[1:35:05] but when god instructed them go forward
[1:35:08] he knew what he was telling them
[1:35:11] and moses
[1:35:13] raised his
[1:35:14] rod on a sea
[1:35:16] and the bible said that it patted into
[1:35:18] two
[1:35:19] and they walked on a dry ground
[1:35:24] isn't that amazing
[1:35:26] amazing
[1:35:28] they walk on the dragon look
[1:35:32] you just fought them
[1:35:33] how many years
[1:35:35] those waters
[1:35:37] have been there
[1:35:39] you cannot determine the volume of clay
[1:35:43] or mud after there was water
[1:35:48] but the power of god
[1:35:50] his word of creation
[1:35:52] all of a sudden the place became dry
[1:35:56] that is the god that we are worshiping
[1:35:59] that is the god that we are worshipping
[1:36:01] beloved
[1:36:03] and the bible said that israel walk on a
[1:36:05] dry ground
[1:36:08] do you know that why they were crossing
[1:36:12] the egyptians who just also followed
[1:36:14] them
[1:36:17] but they didn't walk on a dry ground
[1:36:20] after israel
[1:36:22] walked
[1:36:23] their back became muddy
[1:36:27] can you say amen there
[1:36:30] they are back because so any place if
[1:36:32] they're rich here is dry ground the
[1:36:34] moment they cross the plains become
[1:36:36] magic
[1:36:37] so the egyptian soldiers
[1:36:40] chased israel
[1:36:41] on a magic ground
[1:36:46] and they could not reach them
[1:36:48] after the last one crossover
[1:36:50] then god penned the waters upside down
[1:36:52] again and he swallowed all of them up
[1:36:56] oh hallelujah
[1:36:58] oh brother sister just speak the word
[1:37:02] i said just speak the word and there
[1:37:04] shall be a performance
[1:37:07] create everything around you by your own
[1:37:11] word
[1:37:12] god have given you that ability
[1:37:15] i say god have given that ability
[1:37:18] don't entertain fear as a christian in
[1:37:20] any circumstances
[1:37:22] speak to the system speak to the
[1:37:25] condition and there shall be creation
[1:37:30] do you remember the woman
[1:37:32] that the bible says that
[1:37:35] he was uh uh what do we call it
[1:37:38] uh
[1:37:40] she was sick
[1:37:41] for 12 years
[1:37:44] the woman with a blood issue that is the
[1:37:45] woman i'm talking about here
[1:37:48] she has been to one hospital to another
[1:37:52] from one physician to another
[1:37:54] and the physicians were making good use
[1:37:57] of of her money
[1:38:00] they prescribed wrong wrong medicines
[1:38:05] and this woman
[1:38:07] one day
[1:38:09] when she heard that christ was passing
[1:38:11] somewhere
[1:38:13] she created a word
[1:38:16] within herself
[1:38:18] nobody advised her
[1:38:20] no doctor taught her but she said but if
[1:38:23] i can touch the hem of his garment i
[1:38:26] will be made oh
[1:38:30] and this woman
[1:38:32] brother
[1:38:35] reached to jesus
[1:38:37] and indeed touched his hand
[1:38:41] the helm of his garment
[1:38:43] and immediately
[1:38:45] she was healed
[1:38:48] until the power
[1:38:51] of that healing virtue
[1:38:52] affected the body of jesus christ
[1:38:57] jesus said why peter
[1:38:59] i have become so weak
[1:39:02] he said virtue has gone out of me and
[1:39:04] when virtue is gone out of you you walk
[1:39:06] as if there is air blowing you
[1:39:09] yeah you become so light
[1:39:11] that was the condition that jesus found
[1:39:13] himself in because of the word that a
[1:39:16] woman created
[1:39:19] hallelujah
[1:39:21] he turned around he said peter somebody
[1:39:24] has touched me
[1:39:25] huh who is that peter somebody have
[1:39:27] touched me and peter said oh master
[1:39:31] once we're coming on the way
[1:39:33] there have been so many people
[1:39:36] that have been touching you
[1:39:38] and all that so why do you
[1:39:40] say that
[1:39:42] jesus said you don't know what you are
[1:39:44] talking about
[1:39:45] yes i know that a lot of people have
[1:39:47] touched me
[1:39:48] but this touch
[1:39:50] is different from all
[1:39:53] because this church was a touch of
[1:39:55] creation
[1:39:58] this start was a touch of faith
[1:40:01] hallelujah
[1:40:03] and so once they were asking then the
[1:40:05] woman owner
[1:40:07] jesus said woman
[1:40:09] your faith
[1:40:10] has made you
[1:40:12] whole
[1:40:14] your faith
[1:40:16] meaning your word
[1:40:18] hallelujah has made you whole
[1:40:23] and jesus said in matthew 17
[1:40:27] he say if we have faith
[1:40:30] if we have faith
[1:40:32] and we will not
[1:40:34] doubt we can speak
[1:40:37] to the mountain
[1:40:39] be thou removed
[1:40:41] and go yonder
[1:40:42] and they have to obey
[1:40:47] that is the word
[1:40:49] equally we can believe
[1:40:51] this is a matter of faith and belief
[1:40:55] because faith
[1:40:58] it is not designed
[1:41:00] by the architects
[1:41:04] faith
[1:41:05] is not designed
[1:41:06] by the uh this uh
[1:41:09] what we call them those who use computer
[1:41:10] to draw
[1:41:13] ah
[1:41:14] there's a name they call them
[1:41:16] graphic designers
[1:41:18] you don't design that
[1:41:20] fight is created by yourself
[1:41:24] the woman created the faith
[1:41:27] and it became a wet on her lips
[1:41:30] if only i can touch
[1:41:33] his garments
[1:41:35] he did it and he succeeded
[1:41:38] oh hallelujah brother today
[1:41:42] that same word
[1:41:43] is what we are using to create our
[1:41:46] environment
[1:41:49] i am a christian today by god's grace
[1:41:52] and nobody prescribed it for me
[1:41:56] i sat down one day
[1:41:58] and i created it
[1:42:00] by my own word
[1:42:03] after swimming in the condition and the
[1:42:05] system of this world
[1:42:08] wasted time and wasted yes
[1:42:11] one day
[1:42:13] i decided
[1:42:15] to follow jesus
[1:42:17] i created it
[1:42:19] and it manifested
[1:42:20] that is what today i'm standing before
[1:42:22] you preaching the word to you
[1:42:24] you did also the same that is why you
[1:42:26] are here today feeding on god's word
[1:42:29] created it by your own self
[1:42:34] amen
[1:42:37] do you remember the story
[1:42:39] the prophet told
[1:42:40] us that one time
[1:42:44] him and some friends brethren
[1:42:47] they went on hunting
[1:42:49] and they come and come and come they
[1:42:51] didn't get in again
[1:42:53] and he was separated a lot of why
[1:42:57] and he thought of going back to see his
[1:42:59] friends so that because it was getting
[1:43:01] late
[1:43:03] then he said all of a sudden
[1:43:05] he had a voice
[1:43:08] speak because the lord knows that he
[1:43:11] loves squirrels
[1:43:13] he said you can speak them into
[1:43:14] existence
[1:43:16] he said
[1:43:17] he was taking a letter back
[1:43:19] the lord is that you
[1:43:22] there was silence for some time
[1:43:24] so he decided to go on
[1:43:26] and the voice came again
[1:43:28] he said speak
[1:43:31] speak them into existence
[1:43:34] man
[1:43:36] so when the prophet was so much
[1:43:38] convinced that indeed it was the same
[1:43:40] voice that speaking to him
[1:43:43] he started to speak
[1:43:49] he looked around him
[1:43:51] it's a law
[1:43:53] i want to ask squirrel to come and patch
[1:43:56] on brother bill's head
[1:44:02] i won't want to be on sister rosanna's
[1:44:03] head
[1:44:07] and i want one to be on brother willis
[1:44:09] head
[1:44:12] i'm just giving example of what happened
[1:44:16] the prophets show exactly where those
[1:44:18] scholars should be
[1:44:22] we did not took off an eye
[1:44:24] lord behold a squirrel
[1:44:27] a squirrel was on the head of barbie
[1:44:32] the prophet rub his face
[1:44:35] can it be true
[1:44:38] yes sir
[1:44:40] his word created
[1:44:44] any shot
[1:44:46] boom
[1:44:48] he waited for some time
[1:44:52] then you look what sister roseanne said
[1:44:54] the second one was on there
[1:44:57] he and he shot
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:04] then it was not quite long
[1:45:06] another one came up on brother crew's
[1:45:08] head
[1:45:10] and that was even closer
[1:45:13] to him than all that he shot
[1:45:16] he aimed at the squirrel
[1:45:19] and he shot the squirrel he missed it
[1:45:23] he shot he missed it
[1:45:25] he shot the message he said what
[1:45:28] how can this be
[1:45:31] me an expert shooter and i'm shooting
[1:45:35] this ring close to me
[1:45:40] then the squirrel went away
[1:45:43] he waited for some time
[1:45:45] then
[1:45:46] the one that he requested to be on
[1:45:48] brother billy brother will's head was
[1:45:50] there
[1:45:51] and he shot it
[1:45:56] three
[1:45:59] he asked for three
[1:46:02] and then god even added one
[1:46:04] to him
[1:46:06] but the one that was on the head over
[1:46:09] the cruise
[1:46:11] he was not able to kill it you know the
[1:46:13] reason because when he was demonstrating
[1:46:17] his words of creation he did not ask god
[1:46:19] to place a day
[1:46:23] can you say amen
[1:46:25] he did not have got to place it there so
[1:46:27] he did not get that one
[1:46:31] his words of creation
[1:46:33] brother
[1:46:35] that god
[1:46:37] has not changed
[1:46:40] that god
[1:46:42] has not changed
[1:46:43] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:46:46] forever
[1:46:48] oh brother
[1:46:50] don't say that you are not a prophet
[1:46:52] sister don't say that you are not a
[1:46:54] prophet the same anointing that god gave
[1:46:57] to the prophet is the same anointing
[1:46:59] that is upon you today
[1:47:04] why are we called believers
[1:47:07] we are called believers because we
[1:47:09] believe something amen
[1:47:14] amen amen and amen
[1:47:17] elijah spoke
[1:47:19] and something happened
[1:47:21] woman spoke and something happened
[1:47:24] and today you can speak
[1:47:26] and something will happen
[1:47:30] why do we lay hands upon their sick and
[1:47:32] pray for them
[1:47:34] if we don't believe that they'll be
[1:47:35] healed why would we pray
[1:47:38] then to become hypocrisy
[1:47:41] but we lay our hands and pray because we
[1:47:44] know god we hear our way
[1:47:47] and heal the sick
[1:47:52] oh hallelujah
[1:47:55] elijah spoke this into existence
[1:47:57] muslims put this into existence
[1:47:59] the same way you can speak today so i
[1:48:02] say speak the word
[1:48:05] and create
[1:48:08] do you know that anything you tell god
[1:48:10] to do
[1:48:11] you put god in action
[1:48:14] are you aware of that
[1:48:16] anything you do anything you tell god to
[1:48:18] do you put god into action
[1:48:22] god will make sure that you have what
[1:48:24] you you say if only you can believe
[1:48:32] man
[1:48:34] oh hallelujah
[1:48:39] now let me read something quickly
[1:48:41] uh from the prophet okay
[1:48:44] he said all things are possible
[1:48:47] now
[1:48:49] just simple trying to hide behind some
[1:48:52] kind of church doctrine instead of
[1:48:54] coming out and saying you ain't got no
[1:48:56] faith
[1:48:57] so that is all
[1:48:59] satan never received the holy ghost
[1:49:04] he don't have nothing he doesn't have
[1:49:06] anything to give you faith
[1:49:09] it is god that god the faith
[1:49:12] and just as you are filled with god you
[1:49:15] are filled with faith
[1:49:20] if you are the son of god
[1:49:23] you are like god
[1:49:25] he just speak the word
[1:49:27] and it creates itself
[1:49:29] his worst the creative power
[1:49:33] how would the world come here
[1:49:36] he made it out of things which were not
[1:49:40] he just said it let there be
[1:49:43] and here it is
[1:49:45] he believed
[1:49:47] his own word
[1:49:50] and today
[1:49:51] you can believe your own
[1:49:54] word oh there man is too small i want a
[1:49:58] big man
[1:49:59] i say you can believe your own word
[1:50:02] and when you believe your own word there
[1:50:04] must be a creation
[1:50:09] amen
[1:50:13] he said cut every obstacle from human
[1:50:16] beings
[1:50:18] that they might be connected
[1:50:20] like in the garden of eden
[1:50:23] i was going to chuck it
[1:50:25] but i am going to say it
[1:50:30] the prophet didn't choke it too i'll not
[1:50:31] also choke it i will say it in here
[1:50:36] he said man is omnipotent
[1:50:40] man you and i
[1:50:44] he said you don't believe that
[1:50:47] but he is
[1:50:50] he said a man that is fully surrounded
[1:50:53] to god is omnipotent
[1:50:57] did not he said in mark 11 2 2
[1:51:00] whatever things you say
[1:51:02] and don't doubt in your heart it will
[1:51:04] come to pass
[1:51:06] you can have what you have said
[1:51:11] what happens
[1:51:13] when two omnipotents meet
[1:51:17] when god and man comes together through
[1:51:20] omnipotence
[1:51:21] something got to shake
[1:51:26] oh hallelujah
[1:51:29] when god and man comes together
[1:51:31] something got to shake
[1:51:35] whosoever you say or whatsoever you say
[1:51:39] with that creative power of an
[1:51:41] importance of god
[1:51:43] knowing that his he has promised it and
[1:51:46] he said it in his word it creates a
[1:51:49] power that goes out yonder and brings
[1:51:53] things to pass
[1:51:57] things that is not
[1:51:59] it makes them as though they are
[1:52:03] because two omnipotents have met
[1:52:07] their histones
[1:52:08] oh
[1:52:10] isn't he wonderful
[1:52:13] too omnipotence meets
[1:52:16] and you are one
[1:52:18] then god is one
[1:52:22] but you meet on his way
[1:52:27] you don't just meet
[1:52:29] you meet on his way
[1:52:32] hallelujah
[1:52:35] that day
[1:52:37] when peter
[1:52:39] and john
[1:52:41] were entering into the beautiful what
[1:52:43] the what the sanctuary
[1:52:46] and they met that
[1:52:49] who was always
[1:52:51] there begging for arms
[1:52:55] and the bible said that when they got
[1:52:56] there
[1:52:57] the man stretch his hand
[1:53:00] expecting to get something from them
[1:53:04] but peter
[1:53:05] and john look on the man
[1:53:08] and they told him
[1:53:10] man look on us
[1:53:15] peter didn't say look on me
[1:53:18] oh look on john
[1:53:20] he said look on us
[1:53:24] so the ass is plural is that not it
[1:53:27] and you may think that it was only peter
[1:53:30] and john standing there but the lord
[1:53:31] jesus christ was standing there with
[1:53:33] them
[1:53:35] so he said look on us
[1:53:39] silver we don't have
[1:53:41] god we don't have
[1:53:43] diamond we don't have
[1:53:45] but what we have here right now is what
[1:53:48] we are giving you in the name of jesus
[1:53:51] christ of god rise up and the man arose
[1:53:56] the creative power from the word of a
[1:53:59] man
[1:54:01] god have put you in that condition
[1:54:05] don't belittle yourself so long as your
[1:54:07] faith is concerned
[1:54:09] sometimes christians we entertain fear
[1:54:11] hey this thing that i'm going to pray on
[1:54:13] will it work oh
[1:54:15] don't never consider those
[1:54:19] attack the situation by faith
[1:54:22] and create the word
[1:54:26] amen
[1:54:28] they say that in the name of jesus
[1:54:30] christ the one that we are standing here
[1:54:32] with
[1:54:33] we say rise
[1:54:34] up and the man arose
[1:54:38] and he was jumping
[1:54:40] and he was dumping he was jumping and
[1:54:43] limping and shouting and praising god
[1:54:48] hallelujah
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:53] just speak the word beloved
[1:54:56] and there shall be a performance
[1:55:00] when two omnipotent meets
[1:55:03] god happened
[1:55:07] when the prophet went to the lemon
[1:55:09] mountains in sabrina kenyon
[1:55:12] you remember what happened there
[1:55:14] so many things happened
[1:55:18] the one notable one was when you saw
[1:55:20] savannah picking him up
[1:55:23] and revealing the secret of all the
[1:55:25] bible to him
[1:55:28] and the lord will go and preach
[1:55:30] it it was at that vein that when they
[1:55:33] were going
[1:55:35] the mystery cloud formed in the skies
[1:55:39] whether you believe that or not
[1:55:42] there are people that believe that
[1:55:46] why would that thing happen over there
[1:55:48] it was because two omnipotent have met
[1:55:55] and one day
[1:55:57] this same prophet went to the home
[1:55:59] of sister hattie
[1:56:03] you know that sister patty was a poor
[1:56:05] sister
[1:56:08] the prophet described her situation
[1:56:10] sometimes it was pitiful
[1:56:13] and there was such an anointing that
[1:56:15] came upon the prophet
[1:56:18] and he went to see the sister
[1:56:21] he said sister hating
[1:56:24] ask anything
[1:56:26] that you desire
[1:56:29] and if it doesn't fall on your lap
[1:56:32] don't believe me to be a servant of god
[1:56:36] and he was going up and down
[1:56:39] he was going up and down
[1:56:41] his word
[1:56:43] has started creating
[1:56:46] sister he said if you want even one
[1:56:48] million dollars right now
[1:56:52] consider it done
[1:56:54] he was going up and down
[1:56:57] and the woman was thinking about what to
[1:56:59] say
[1:57:02] her sister
[1:57:04] did it
[1:57:05] was crippled all the time
[1:57:10] but
[1:57:11] what
[1:57:12] happened to her
[1:57:15] her conscience shifted
[1:57:18] to his her two sons
[1:57:20] who were not believers
[1:57:22] but even when this thing was going on
[1:57:24] according to the story they were making
[1:57:26] some mockery
[1:57:29] and so sister
[1:57:30] sister hetty i got a hold of them
[1:57:33] immediately
[1:57:35] and he told the prophet
[1:57:37] i want the salvation of my sons
[1:57:41] the prophet said have it
[1:57:44] immediately
[1:57:46] immediately these two children who were
[1:57:49] making mercury of this system the thing
[1:57:51] that was going on they rushed and knelt
[1:57:54] down and asked god to forgive them and
[1:57:56] they repented
[1:58:00] west of creation
[1:58:03] oh hallelujah brother
[1:58:06] we can do the same thing right now
[1:58:10] because the power in the message of this
[1:58:13] hour it will never lose
[1:58:18] until all the ransom church of jesus
[1:58:20] christ
[1:58:21] be saved
[1:58:23] until the bread of jesus christ is
[1:58:26] raptured
[1:58:27] and when we are going we go with that
[1:58:29] power
[1:58:31] don't let us belittle ourselves
[1:58:34] don't let us sometimes think that those
[1:58:37] powers are no longer the word of god is
[1:58:39] still here with us
[1:58:41] and it's in us
[1:58:42] we can create by it
[1:58:47] hallelujah
[1:58:50] now i'm going on to the holy spirit
[1:58:54] and when i get into here i am in the
[1:58:56] holy spirit by a baptism

[1:59:14] believer power to speak with tom's power
[1:59:17] to interpret tongues
[1:59:19] it is full of power
[1:59:21] for the holy spirit is the power of god

[2:02:16] but that sounds too still
[2:02:20] is it whatever god did i don't know
[2:02:23] you remember that story
[2:02:25] that when the uh amorites and americans
[2:02:29] were against uh joshua and israel
[2:02:33] and each drive prayed a prayer
[2:02:35] he was going to
[2:02:37] i mean fight them
[2:02:39] and he organized his soldiers
[2:02:43] and he attacked them
[2:02:45] and when it was destroying the enemies
[2:02:47] it was getting light
[2:02:49] it was getting late
[2:02:51] but joshua wanted to finish his enemies
[2:02:55] so he stood up

[2:03:31] and the bob said there had never been a
[2:03:33] day like that
[2:03:34] that a man who stopped the movement of

[2:04:16] and as long as you are in the line of
[2:04:18] duty

[2:04:22] doing just what he told you to do
[2:04:26] matching by the others of god
[2:04:29] you've got a right to say to that
[2:04:32] mountain be moved
[2:04:36] god keep his word
[2:04:38] if you say to this mountain be moved
[2:04:41] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[2:04:43] that that what you said will come to
[2:04:46] pass you can have that
[2:04:48] what you have said

[2:04:57] he said be in the line of duty
[2:05:02] meaning be
[2:05:03] on the word of god
[2:05:07] what god what says that is what you know
[2:05:11] because you cannot be outside the word
[2:05:13] of god
[2:05:15] and think that your word can create the
[2:05:17] atmosphere no
[2:05:19] you must be in the word
[2:05:22] and on the word and jesus said
[2:05:24] that day you will know that i am in the
[2:05:27] father and i you and you in me
[2:05:31] and the prophet said what day is that he
[2:05:34] said today
[2:05:37] not yesterday not tomorrow but today
[2:05:40] today there you will believe the word of
[2:05:42] god
[2:05:43] he is in you
[2:05:45] and you are in him
[2:05:48] your word can create
[2:05:52] your word can create beloved
[2:05:55] your word can create
[2:05:58] according to the word
[2:06:00] amen
[2:06:03] now
[2:06:05] in closing
[2:06:07] i want to ask a question
[2:06:09] if this world
[2:06:12] the way it has been so confused
[2:06:15] does he put fear in you
[2:06:20] no
[2:06:22] the answer is what no
[2:06:25] if it is putting fear in you then it
[2:06:28] means you are lacking something
[2:06:33] that is why we have allowed ourselves
[2:06:37] to be molded
[2:06:39] into the image of god
[2:06:43] all this that we are talking about
[2:06:44] beloved you must allow yourself for the
[2:06:47] word of god to mold you
[2:06:49] into the image of god
[2:06:52] if you are not in the image of god
[2:06:54] forget about it
[2:06:57] but if you allow yourself
[2:06:59] like the prophet said that
[2:07:01] when the blasphemy puts the iron into
[2:07:04] the fire
[2:07:07] he blows the fire examined it
[2:07:09] he blows it for the fire to kindle
[2:07:12] to bend the metal
[2:07:14] so it will come to a point
[2:07:16] that that metal and the fire there will
[2:07:19] be no difference
[2:07:22] and when it is yellow or red like that
[2:07:25] that he pull it from the fire and place
[2:07:28] it on an unveil
[2:07:30] oh
[2:07:32] hallelujah
[2:07:34] and then he hammered that metal
[2:07:37] why is he a marinade
[2:07:39] he is hammering because he is trying to
[2:07:42] mood
[2:07:45] we'll close very soon don't worry
[2:07:47] hallelujah brother can you put that
[2:07:49] thing on board for us
[2:07:53] amen
[2:07:55] let us see some some little uh uh what
[2:07:58] yes
[2:07:59] uh uh some little objects
[2:08:02] that
[2:08:03] all the instruments for that matter
[2:08:05] that the
[2:08:06] what we call the blasphemy to use which
[2:08:08] are very notable
[2:08:10] i want us to go through that quickly and
[2:08:12] then we go okay
[2:08:13] are you tired
[2:08:17] give her the anvil
[2:08:20] the angel
[2:08:22] is the main thing that the blast meat
[2:08:24] always you know
[2:08:26] to nail those metal on
[2:08:30] okay
[2:08:32] yes
[2:08:33] that is the anvil down there
[2:08:35] and on that anvil oh it's not out here
[2:08:39] but i see it on my on my screen
[2:08:44] okay let's give the brothers a little
[2:08:45] time okay
[2:08:47] amy i don't want you to get tired
[2:08:51] sometimes i look to some of you your
[2:08:53] face and and
[2:08:54] i want to close
[2:08:57] and at the same time i look to some
[2:08:59] people's face and i want to preach
[2:09:00] preach preach preach
[2:09:04] yes sir
[2:09:05] sometimes when we are behind the pulpit
[2:09:07] some people their faces take our
[2:09:09] anointing away
[2:09:12] so when i'm preaching there are some
[2:09:14] faces i don't look at
[2:09:17] i look at the faces that can make me
[2:09:19] preach more
[2:09:21] because there are people
[2:09:23] small time they think they are so much
[2:09:25] tired and they begin to change their
[2:09:26] faces somehow and they close close close
[2:09:29] close
[2:09:31] not close
[2:09:45] amen
[2:09:48] yes
[2:09:49] that is the unveil
[2:09:51] okay
[2:09:53] can i go on
[2:09:55] now the unveil
[2:09:58] it has six components
[2:10:00] on it
[2:10:02] and this component
[2:10:04] each and everyone has a particular work
[2:10:08] that the plasmid use
[2:10:11] informing those what do we collect
[2:10:15] the product
[2:10:17] we have the hardy hole on it
[2:10:20] we have the preachy hole
[2:10:22] we have something to call the step
[2:10:25] we have the horn
[2:10:27] we have the face
[2:10:28] and we have the round edge
[2:10:30] six of them
[2:10:32] and we know according to our revelation
[2:10:35] that the masses is always a mass number
[2:10:39] but the number seven
[2:10:41] is always god
[2:10:43] but you ask yourself
[2:10:45] why is it so
[2:10:47] now the number seven
[2:10:50] in the factory of this blasphemy
[2:10:54] is always the finished product
[2:10:58] because you use the six components to
[2:11:00] mold the object
[2:11:02] and when the object finish
[2:11:04] then that one becomes the seventh
[2:11:07] so the seventh is always a mystery oh

[2:11:42] you think there are certainty they know
[2:11:44] what we know

[2:11:47] but the question is why is it that you
[2:11:49] and i there are so many things that we
[2:11:51] know
[2:11:52] in the course this is the seventh church
[2:11:56] where god has revealed himself and this
[2:11:59] is the finished work of jesus christ
[2:12:02] oh hallelujah
[2:12:04] and i thank god brother sister i always
[2:12:06] rejoice that god didn't put me in the
[2:12:08] time of paul

[2:12:14] in the time of arenas
[2:12:16] i always rejoiced god didn't put me in
[2:12:18] the time of columbus or martin or martin

[2:12:29] [Applause]
[2:12:31] amen amen
[2:12:32] the finished product of god
[2:12:35] we are the bride of jesus christ
[2:12:38] and the bible says that without us they
[2:12:41] are not perfect
[2:12:43] it means we are the finished product of
[2:12:45] jesus christ
[2:12:47] so long as the blood of jesus christ is
[2:12:49] concerned
[2:12:51] i don't care how the world will look at
[2:12:53] us
[2:12:56] amen
[2:12:57] because they cannot understand us
[2:13:00] and we too would not understand them
[2:13:04] whether they like it or not
[2:13:08] we
[2:13:09] are those
[2:13:11] that the prophets of old
[2:13:13] are looking onto
[2:13:15] and they are shouting
[2:13:17] they are shouting
[2:13:19] they are shouting
[2:13:20] finish hard
[2:13:22] finish hard
[2:13:24] finish hard
[2:13:25] in fact
[2:13:27] they are looking on you right now
[2:13:31] if you are rejoicing at the preaching of
[2:13:33] the world they are also rejoicing
[2:13:38] if you are sleeping at the preaching of
[2:13:40] the world you make them also those
[2:13:45] brother is it going to work
[2:13:48] is it going to work
[2:13:50] okay don't worry
[2:13:51] if it's not going to work we'll try
[2:13:53] another time but let me finish with this
[2:13:56] now why is the blasphemy
[2:13:59] is on that work
[2:14:00] he has
[2:14:01] the mind
[2:14:02] of what he's molding is that not it
[2:14:06] he has the mind
[2:14:08] and when he move the letter from the
[2:14:11] fire
[2:14:12] it is not the matter that tells the
[2:14:15] blasphemy put me here or there
[2:14:19] if the blasphemy need to use the
[2:14:22] preaching
[2:14:23] he will use it
[2:14:25] if you use the hardy hole you will use
[2:14:27] it
[2:14:28] if you use the horn on the wrong edge
[2:14:30] you will use it
[2:14:32] that metal don't have any say
[2:14:36] that is why we don't tell god how he
[2:14:38] should make us
[2:14:41] we don't tell god god do this god do
[2:14:43] that god make me this way god knows what
[2:14:46] he has prepared us for
[2:14:50] oh praise the name of our god
[2:14:56] and
[2:14:59] once you put the metal on the anvil
[2:15:02] he'll raise the hammer
[2:15:05] amen
[2:15:07] because the metal is ready to be struck
[2:15:12] there is something they call billows
[2:15:15] or the fan we call it fun the one that
[2:15:18] they squeeze
[2:15:19] it has two two um handles this horizon
[2:15:22] have you seen it before
[2:15:23] great
[2:15:24] and they squeeze this together
[2:15:26] and that is what emitted air
[2:15:29] to put the fire on fire let me put it
[2:15:32] that way it put the fire on fire
[2:15:35] they squeeze it together one here one
[2:15:37] day the old testament and the new
[2:15:40] testament we squeeze it together
[2:15:43] we squeeze it together to build the
[2:15:45] deliver
[2:15:47] if you believe that i say amen here
[2:15:50] the old testament and the newton we
[2:15:52] don't preach only old testament we don't
[2:15:54] preach all the news testament
[2:15:57] we squeeze both together
[2:15:59] to build the church of jesus christ
[2:16:02] oh hallelujah
[2:16:04] and when the fire is burning within that
[2:16:07] you realize that the metal becomes so
[2:16:10] red
[2:16:11] and you cannot differentiate
[2:16:13] that is why the believer your character
[2:16:15] and the doctor jesus christ must unite
[2:16:20] they say
[2:16:21] they have to see what they say that is a
[2:16:23] christian
[2:16:27] and then
[2:16:29] when the blasphemy pulls that metal
[2:16:34] this is what they call the tongs
[2:16:37] some call it a device
[2:16:39] they use it to grab
[2:16:40] the metal because of course he cannot
[2:16:42] use his hand
[2:16:44] and pull it from the fire and put it on
[2:16:47] the anvil
[2:16:48] now all those things represent the word
[2:16:51] of god
[2:16:53] because yes god bless you that is the
[2:16:55] anvil
[2:16:57] and it has
[2:16:59] six components on it
[2:17:01] and he he uses it at all times but the
[2:17:04] product is the finished product or
[2:17:07] the service
[2:17:09] and when he move the
[2:17:12] metal from the fire
[2:17:13] and put it on the anvil
[2:17:17] then he raised the hammer
[2:17:20] to do what
[2:17:22] to do what
[2:17:24] to hit it
[2:17:26] and begin his mood
[2:17:28] and he read the hammer
[2:17:30] remember that hammer is the word of god
[2:17:34] maybe
[2:17:36] the thinking man fell down
[2:17:38] and you used to hit the metal
[2:17:45] when he realized
[2:17:47] that it is getting cold you put it back
[2:17:50] into the fire is that not it
[2:17:52] and you fan again
[2:17:55] you see that is where
[2:17:57] the only place we have our joy
[2:18:00] is not on the football park
[2:18:04] it's not on the dancing halls
[2:18:08] it is not where you smoke cigarette and
[2:18:10] we
[2:18:11] or marijuana
[2:18:13] but our joy we have it in the house of
[2:18:16] god
[2:18:17] oh praise the name of our god i know
[2:18:19] satan don't like what i'm saying but i
[2:18:21] believe it
[2:18:24] is where we have our joy
[2:18:27] don't tell me that but daniel when i get
[2:18:30] my pizza and my ice cream i am joyous
[2:18:34] no
[2:18:37] that is necessary anyhow for your body
[2:18:40] but the reaction that gives you joy is
[2:18:42] when you come to the house of god
[2:18:47] hallelujah
[2:18:51] then he will find it again and pull it
[2:18:53] up again and put it there and you raise
[2:18:55] the the hammer
[2:18:58] maybe christ is the mystery of god
[2:19:00] revealed
[2:19:02] he will palm palm palm
[2:19:06] is moodiness
[2:19:10] brother
[2:19:12] my sweet sister
[2:19:14] i don't know the message
[2:19:16] that got ahold of you
[2:19:19] there are so many people
[2:19:21] they came face to face with the message
[2:19:24] of this hour they read a book and they
[2:19:27] believed
[2:19:28] that is the hammer of god on you that
[2:19:30] day
[2:19:33] i said that was the hammer of god on you
[2:19:36] that day
[2:19:38] it broke you
[2:19:40] it put you into pieces
[2:19:42] and it reminded you
[2:19:45] from that day
[2:19:49] you were a new creature
[2:19:52] the bible said that if you come into the
[2:19:53] lord
[2:19:54] behold all things are gone
[2:19:57] and all things has become new
[2:20:01] now in closing
[2:20:04] when the blasphemy hit the matter
[2:20:08] do you know
[2:20:09] that there are some particles that break
[2:20:12] down
[2:20:14] and
[2:20:15] the blasphemy don't need that again
[2:20:18] you know that the blasphemy don't take
[2:20:20] it again
[2:20:21] because he don't need it
[2:20:25] and when god brabile put us in a fire
[2:20:29] and you use the below to furnace
[2:20:32] and we bend like the same fire and
[2:20:34] instead of hitting us with that ion
[2:20:37] things broke out from us
[2:20:42] fornication broke out from us
[2:20:46] adultery broke out from us
[2:20:49] cigarette smoking broke out from us
[2:20:53] fighting
[2:20:55] broke out from us
[2:20:57] gossiping broke out from us
[2:21:00] stealing stealing small small penis it
[2:21:02] broke up from us
[2:21:04] every dirty character broke out from us
[2:21:08] and we became molded
[2:21:10] into the image of god
[2:21:13] that is why we have the power
[2:21:16] to create
[2:21:18] by our world
[2:21:20] he say if you believe
[2:21:22] and you don't doubt
[2:21:23] tell this mountain be down removed
[2:21:26] and go up your neck and they will obey
[2:21:29] you

[2:21:32] the lord strengthen you the lord fill
[2:21:34] you with his goodness the lord let his
[2:21:36] face shine upon you and be in that
[2:21:39] condition from now
[2:21:41] that you are going to create an
[2:21:43] atmosphere that will manifest the
[2:21:46] revealed
[2:21:47] word of god
