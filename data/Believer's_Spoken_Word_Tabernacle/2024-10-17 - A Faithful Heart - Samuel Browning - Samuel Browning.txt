Lord and father we just Lord want to be careful Lord to follow you in all things Lord we love you and we thank you father in Jesus name amen am amen I want to go into Job chapter 27 and U I'm kind of moving ahead to this chapter and I just just felt pressed on my heart just some weeks back to move to this there's a lot in job 24 I've been just wanting to move into but I think this will really set some direction for where we will go there if God will give us Grace and that's what he sees fit so it's always it's always subject to him so in job 27 I'm just going to read few the few first six verses and then we'll let you have your seat moreover job continued his Parable and said as God liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit God forbid that I should justify you till I die I will not remove mine Integrity from me my righteousness I hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live I tell you what to me what a beautiful testimony yes sir amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated and uh I'd like to speak here tonight on a thought a faithful heart and knowing that that's was always God's intention and that's where God desires to dwell and that's what God desires in our life is is our heart in all things and remember when he came among the Pharisees they they had everything outwardly just just right but Jesus would look at the uh the disciples and say except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees and it's has to exceed that now there's absolutely no way that a man could ever in his own self be able to exceed of the righteousness of even when you consider the Pharisees they were right to the law on so many things right to the point even if certain things they wouldn't even you know uh eat out of this or eat out of that were keeping so many things but God was speaking of a righteousness that man in himself could never work himself into but it would have to be imparted by God's own life and that's what Paul would speak of in 1 Corinthians 3 when he would declare to us of was because in in reality the law itself was was glorious in that the law was actually describing God's Own nature but man in himself we were uh contrary in our nature because of the fall to the nature of God we couldn't remedy that remember God God God made a way so that man would man would would sin and man would fall God made a way that man could come back into the presence of God to worship him through and by the sacrifice of an innocent one but God's ultimate desire was that that righteousness would come into our own lives and there's only one thing that could bring it there and that would be through and by the shed blood of the innocent one of God himself coming down and becoming the Supreme sacrifice for you and I it couldn't be the blood of of any any that was born uh sexual many great men through through the scriptures Elijah Jeremiah on and on Abraham but none of that could satisfy it must be a blood that was not connected with that of the polluted line but it had to be God himself created a blood cell God created that body that Tabernacle that was purposed for death it was purposed for Redemption that he might impart to you and I as Paul said that Spirit of his own self which is the spirit of righteousness of which he himself is revealed to be our MDC the king of righteousness there is no higher righteousness than the righteous of God's own life and God made a way that you and I could even become partakers of that of of of his own life and come back into a place to where you and I can stand just exactly as we ought to stand and God intended us as Sons and Daughters of God where there's no condemnation in our lives and where we're standing free and clear and there's a righteousness of God's own life that is so come into our life and there's been an operation that's been performed by the Holy Ghost so it's no longer our own faith but now it is God's faith that has moved down into our lives as a matter of fact brother bam tells us it is God's faith that actually receives himself into our life into the temple that he has prepared without hands because that place that God prepared without hands is that seed that expression of himself that always lay there within you and I that was the dwelling place and God himself is the one who has made a way that he might dwell within you and I that's so good all of these many types and scriptures and examples through the scripture all all point to this with every true child of God and of the elect all the way down through time I want you to think that even when the prophet of God was was uh moved to select the different messengers of the church ages uh uh brother you know polycarp was a wonderful man he was a just had a tremendous testimony but brother bam when when he would choose Paul to be that first church age messenger he spoke in this way and he says the reason that he didn't choose polycarp is because polycarp leaned a little bit towards organization and you see it wasn't that he was in it it just leaned a little bit to it and so in order to be that messenger that was chosen here God set that pattern of Paul and I I say that with this in mind of how that God himself in within the measure of it of when God looks down into the very uh depths of our life I'm glad that what God looks upon is our heart this is when it comes down to everything that's said and done this right here these simple words a faithful heart is a life that's worthy of rapture that's so good and so when we think of this here in the scripture there's no more beautiful testimony that not only job would have but that you and I could have and that is that in the midst of it of everything that was taking place job had declared my righteousness I am holding fast and I'm not going to let it go now he had already went through there had been 26 chapters of dialogue that had taken place actually up to 25 and here he is still standing and maintaining his testimony after all of this period of time whether it was days weeks months I I don't know but whatever the time was it just goes to show that Revelation is does not respect time but Revelation supersedes time Revelation goes beyond circumstances this is why there's nothing as great and Powerful as Revelation it is prevailing power because Revelation is the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon your eyes to see what God actually sees and to actually see victory over the enemy to see yourself as God sees you that's that is the privilege that is given by God's grace we did not earn that but that is given to You and I by the grace of Almighty God this is why Jesus could say blessed are your ears that hear and your eyes that see for many long these were men who actually saw by Revelation what was coming but Jesus said you're blessed because it's no longer a prophecy but you're seeing the manifestation and you're recognizing it you're being moved by this you're seeing what they saw do you realize what he was saying he was letting them know you are in the same company of Fellowship that the prophets were in and they were caught up into the mind of God what a blessed Fellowship prise the Lord hallelujah a faithful heart that within it I I think that's the most if God will allow us Grace here tonight just to take a little example of this and just to look here in the scriptures of this part of a faithful heart because you know job job was not a man in all these other scriptures where he's actually trying to defend himself as though he's a guilty guy and he's trying to defend himself but job is standing here and he knows where he's standing not because of his merits but he knows he's standing here because of God's revealed Grace to his life and that if there's something that doesn't hit the mark it is Grace that lets him know it's not hitting the mark and Grace it makes a way for reconciliation and job was standing there with that Divine Assurance in his life Oh my he had a faithful heart he wasn't presuming he wasn't wondering he wasn't job didn't say well I can't even look at this right now he's job's not trying to cover anything up he's only saying this is the cover I'm under I'm under the cover of the shed blood that has been revealed revealed by God's voice J what are you testifying to I'm testifying to the blood that's what I'm under I just say it here this I say it here tonight if there's anything that we can ever and should ever be guilty of and that is oh God let us be guilty of bragging on the blood of Jesus Christ because you set aside the blood of Jesus Christ we have no life because life has come through the blood because without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin Hallelujah we could not even approach into his presence but God himself made a way that you and I might be able to approach him it's a faithful heart and this is why when the scripture could say therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we also we stand we have an access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God you realize the prophet would tell us he'd say you know job offered the burnt offering he said you don't have to offer the burnt offering now all that you have to do is have faith in the offering that's already been made for you and truly when job offered the burnt offering that was his display of the faith that he had received or heard from God and he offered what God had required amen I I think there's no greater no greater privilege don't don't don't let us ever underestimate or devalue the greatness of obedience Saul came back with so many things that he thought and the people were pressing him about and Saul was led astray from fulfilling what God had caused him to do but oh I believe I believe I'm one of them and I believe I'm speaking to people that value God's word above their own reasonings above their own imaginations and above their their own ideas to say I don't understand it there's some Choice Ox in here there's some Choice sheep but I have been commissioned by God to destroy everything I don't know I don't know how it'll all come out but I know that if I stay in line and in step with God God is a provider he is Jehovah Gyra God already sees the end from the beginning so I'm going to stay with the word of God I'm not going to reason it out that's called a faithful heart a faithful heart doesn't mean you or I understand and everything is that I've heard his voice and I'm standing on what his voice has said that's a faithful heart amen Abraham do you know what's going to happen there on Mount Mariah I don't amen but I know this right here we're coming back down off the mountain we're going to go worship and we're coming back down do you know all the in between I don't know all the in [Applause] between but what I do know is God has spoken that March of Mount Mariah was a victory marchall it was a victory march that told a testimony here's a man that God has brought into maturity into full adoption to where his heart completely trusts [Music] God I believe I'm looking at Abraham seed tonight a faithful heart job alone knew he was right how many times you feel alone sometimes you feel all alone job was Alone brother BM said he alone knew he was right and where he was standing I mean think of it job was here he would go into the marketplaces and when he would go and people would come to seek counsel of him as it says in job 29 job rehearses all this and and and now now you have a situation where even his wife has come to him and said hey man enough's enough just Curse God and die I mean come on and then he has those from his church brother Bram called him in uh uh uh uh um 1964 and Jesus come and called he said then he had the friends he said that'd be like the deacons coming to you from from your church and coming to you I I when I look at how brother Bram says that because you know I think about how that deacons and and hear us to stand you know collectively and things with the ministry I'm talking about standing with the word but to imagine here is job uh his children has been lost not just one seven every one of them have been Lo everything's been taken away from him I'm not going to say that we don't suffer but I think it's safe to say that no one here tonight has went through and been where job has been we've been in certain areas and certain aspects of it and it's not necessary that God has to reprove this God was simply showing through job's life I'm going to show a testimony of what it is for every man and woman that actually hears my voice and comes Under The Fellowship of the blood they will stand there in the midst of everything else and placed Me Above themselves above their own feelings above everything else their heart will remain faithful I want to just say this very quickly a faithful heart God begins with the infancy even as it starts through repentance sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's continuing to grow and grow and grow there's a maturing going on this is how you look at Abraham's life you say is that scriptural sure it is you look in Abraham's life and Paul would also say to to the Thessalonian church he said that your faith would abound he would also speak about that your love would abound so there's a growing and a matter fact the prophet would say it like this and on the wings of a snow white dove he would say at the end of that in that prayer I love it he he talks about God opening opening his word in this hour oh he says God he said this word that you have opened has led me to a faith I never had before the word this word that God has revealed let me tell you something you know the word that God has revealed in this hour listen friends there's things that we can look at in the scriptures and doctrinally we know where we're standing but let me say this to you the greatest stand that you can know is when the seals are taken off the book and when you can see yourself like John seen himself like the prophet said when John begin to worship he said the reason that he worshiped the way he did is because John looked and said there's John hallah he saw himself and that brought a worship into his life Hallelujah that's where our that's where Victory is drawn from this is where we're we're standing like job the prophet would say it like this standing Pat or flat footed and flat-footed means it's an uncompromising stand in a matter it's firm it's it's solid it's staying right there and so this God he had heard God speak to him God had spoken listen job didn't just wander into this and trying to find wonder what the acceptable way but God revealed himself to job look at friends it wasn't you and I that found God it was this message it wasn't you and I that found this message right it's God who found you and I God knew God knew where you and I were at and he came looking for you and I is that right and God spoke to job he revealed himself to job job knew I've heard his voice and when he stood upon that burnt offering there was that confirmation that came as a direct witness from God he heard the voice of God speak over his obedience Thou Art just amen that's what the word speaks friends that's so good that's what the word speaks and it didn't move him a bit now I want to just look at this acceptance here this acceptance was expressed how many believe that our faith is expressed works works always express the faith notice the testimony this is back from chapter one but you see it it matters here because here in verse one this is Job's testimony among the whole the whole Community among everybody that he's around he was a perfect and upright and one that feared God and Es skewed evil this was his testimony among everybody else but let me just tell you the reason he had that kind of a testimony was not because job had good DNA naturally it was because of verse 8 verse 8 that testimony which was before verse one that testimony was God when the Lord had this was God what he spoke and thought of job he said there's none like him in all the Earth he's a perfect that means blameless an upright man one that feareth God and esth or departeth from evil that was his testimony in the heavenlies and the testimonies in the Heavenly thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven you see what it was in heaven was actually being acted out on Earth you know why because job if we can look say accept it this way job was a man that had been positioned in Heavenly places Hallelujah he knew the Divine Authority that had been given to him that been had to him through and by the revelation of the provided sacrifice of the lamb now when you think of this job himself let me just uh proceed on here job knew that the heart mattered yes right that's good are you hearing me he knew the heart mattered this is why the scripture says it was so in the days of their feasting talking about his children and job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts right thus did job continually so he wasn't offering it because of actions are you hearing me now that's good he's dealing with the heart because it's where the heart gets dealt with the actions will cease amen yes sir and before we ever act out it's already got to be accepted in our heart right we have to take in the thought and process it so here he knows that the offering has got to be about their hearts hallelu that's why even as parents as we pray for the hearts of our children we pray for the hearts of one another listen don't get your eyes on one another pray for one another's Hearts you pray for my heart I'll pray for your heart because that's what God is actually looking at is our hearts that's what he came to reconcile himself Satan took the head God took the heart and job job understood this it's the heart that matters before God that was the Revelation that job had and that's why he could say my heart shall not re reproach me cuz he knew that God was looking at his heart and his heart was under the blood all things confessed thank you Lord yes sir you Lord hallelujah job knowed his heart he knew he was in the line of reconciliation Hallelujah notice how the prophet says it here he says concerning job job said and through all the accusations I am satisfied that I've never I have never I I'm not a secret sinner right right my heart is clean before god notice before God it's clean that's what matters and I've made my sacrifice there you are then stand on it if you've met God's requirements stay right there don't you move Amen brother Bram goes on to talk about how Abraham called anything that was contrary to it as though it wasn't he says job in in paragraph 113 job stayed right with it man when all of his friends his wife everybody you know there's only one place that job was left to stand and that was on the word of God that's he had no other place to stand and just goes to show you all other ground is sinking s there is no other comforter outside of the comforter himself who is the word he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I don't care what comes your way we have a friend that stick is closer than a brother that's right yesen hallelujah amen he who was not ashamed to become one of us to become identified with us that through and by his vicarious suffering and the imparting of his life that we might become identified with him oh don't you love him amen job's testimony was remember what we read in job 23 job said he knows the way I take right he knows the path because it's his right like when the Revelation when brother bramus finished preaching and here Danny Henry walks up and the spirit of God comes down and anoints him and he speaks in another tongue a French tongue and here there are interpreters from the UN and others that are sitting there and here it begins to ring out that thou has chosen the harder way and that way is my way and because of this Choice a huge a portion of Heaven awaits for you glory he knew the way he was taking job knew his steps where he was walking and he had a testimony my steps have not gone back in other words when there were times of convenience I stood upon God's word when things would have been more convenient for job when things would have been better for job but I've stood upon God's word friends we're talking about a mature Son of God you know I hope you can catch this here tonight it's God establishing the aiming point that through and by the the the Holy Spirit the new birth it brings about a child of God that is able and will stand on the word of God when all of their senses give way when everything else all around gives way they'll stand upon God's word amen anybody know what I'm talking about oh yeah when there's things that don't even make sense to your mind right of the way that you're standing it almost as like you've got two people inside of you you you just think I look at that like it don't make no sense of this but you know there's something that's deeper than even my intellect there's something that's deeper that's holding me it's something that when everything else comes in it cast it out there's a strength that's there oh maybe if we should get to dwelling on it too long we'd get a little down but getting a little down can never knock away the Revelation that's in your soul greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world that Revelation listen is Christ himself revealed to you as a son and daughter of God you've got authority over that thought [Applause] sometimes God will allow that mind to be tormented the prophet says that in many different places he said people can say oh could that really be of God he said sure he said sometimes even after you're prayed for God will allow things to go on he said and allow torment the enemy to come and want to torment you accuse you and tell you everything in the world he said but God will only permit that because he's called you to be a testimony in all of his glory that no matter all the mind battles and all the torment that you can send their way there is something inside of them that's greater than their own resolution it is that of the sovereignty of God that came from God's own mind Hallelujah I feel like running here tonight but I got to stay here and [Applause] preach job said I have not gone back from his commandment as a matter of fact I want you to know I have a esteemed his Commandments and what he said from his mouth I esteemed it more than my food that means more to me than anything else his word here's a man that's standing on the word I want you to think of this job had every bit of the mechanics now let me just let me drop this here just a moment job had all the mechanics in order he had done what God had revealed to him to do being a prophet God spoke to him through inspiration and job knew that inspiration is the Dynamics of God that'll come upon the mechanics and so job had all the mechanics in order brother BR said he offered that burnt sacrifice and brother R said oh if we as the church could get the mechanics in order do all that God has asked us to do our hearts right repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ these are these are all mechanics you you see friends listen the Dynamics do not come where there's no mechanics right the Dynamics come to make the mechanics live is that right we got to hold the balance here what the prophet teaches when he tells us about that Cadillac in the rising of the sun when he tells us about that Cadillac has dokin seats and all these great things and wonderful things and he said here it is a beautiful car but he said if if there ain't no fire in there it'll never go down the road but he said it's got to have gasoline you don't have gasoline I don't care how many Sparks you got this is why God had to restore the word in this hour amen so that the Dynamics will come upon that word where there's a people that have made themselves ready and God has sent a word by his grace for you and I that the mechanics in our life would be ready for the Dynamics to strike and take us off of this Earth Hallelujah the mechanics in order it's the same way when it comes for healing brother BR said you just get everything right get everything confessed out he said then your heart you see what happens your heart becomes an open place for God to speak through that's so good it becomes a channel like job was a channel job had a way the prophet said of getting himself out of the way what was that way that job had you said job was A Gifted Man I want to remind you you're a gifted people you go the prophet tells us in the church AG book this Revelation is reserved and revealed to a special class of people a people with prophetic insight and I want to let you know that you've got a gift and that gift in your life the prophet said is that so that came from God and the quickening power comes upon that soul and it makes that word live and so you are gifted like job was gifted able to get yourself out of the way oh what Grace is given to you and I hall hallu now there's got to be an silencing of the accuser remember Satan is the accuser of the Brethren is that right now let's deal with this here in just a moment because this one I'm going to read is from the previous chapter job in job and 27 is speaking but in job 25 is this is the last time that the voice of the accuser is going to speak oh that's good that's good are you hearing me yes sir that's good I I want to let you know that Revelations 5 there's no devil present hallelujah hallelujah are you hearing me you don't read a no devil in Revelations 5 you know what it is friends it's the word that is being revealed that it's Christ who is our intercessor that the blood has done the work it is sufficient and God has sent a word to catch our eyesight from the things of the world to look away to Jes Jesus Hallelujah you know how it is when you're talking about things that you really enjoy every all the other chatter all around you begins to subside and this is what Revelations 5 is it's where a word takes preeminence in a body of Believers it's where the word throws overthrows the accuser the little bck and there's a people that see their enemy dead they see their enemy conquered they see the victory that is in the lamb and he's my lamb he's my [Applause] Passover you talking about bringing out faithful Hearts brother with that kind of love being made manifest how could you do anything else but be faithful hallelujah thank you Lord but here here is the final voice of the accuser in job 25 five dominion and fear are with Him notice how he's painting God he maketh peace in his high places is there any number of his armies upon whom do not not his light arise how then can man be justified with God I want to dwell on verse four how can man be justified with God or how can he be clean that is born of a woman notice these are all questions yeah yeah questions that's right you know what I'm trying to do to lay question s upon the Revelation that job has behold even to the moon and it shineth not yay the stars are not pure in his sight how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm Prophet just simply says it this he knowed job knowed he was righteous because he wasn't trusting in his own merits but he had met God's requirement because he stood on the blood sacrifice he know that he was righteous because he was meeting God's requirements let's take a trip down memory lane is that all right yes sir salvation is of the Lord it is God who came looking for me came looking for you this is I'm standing here because of him Hallelujah than father Titus said after the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost there comes a regeneration the new birth and then the renewing the maturing the growing in the Holy Ghost as a Son of God regeneration and renewing oh I wish I could preach on that tonight which he shed on us a little bit no abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made hes according to the hope of eternal life but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him we are his workmanship can we say Amen to that tonight Hallelujah this is why the prophet over and over would say if that that little Mammy who had that little you know that little mule or that ass that had come and been born and he would say oh my when when the owner comes tomorrow morning he's going to kill me he's going to look at me look how odd I look my floppy ears and look how deformed I look and look how ugly I am and his mama that was well structed in the law she could tell him son let me tell you something you are my firstborn and God has made a way that the firstborn can be redeemed so I want to let you know when the owner comes out in the morning there's going to be a lamb that's going to take your place and the owner is not even going to look at you he's not going to inspect you he is looking at the lamb that stands on your behalf when a worshipper came to the Tabernacle in the wilderness or to Solomon's Temple when they came to offer up their sacrifice the priest did not inspect the worshipper the priest inspected his offering Hallelujah and when he offered that offering it was because of the offering the innocency of the offering and God made such a way he said if you can't get a laugh I'll take this if you can't bring this I'll take this if you can't bring that I'll bring a turtle D I want fellowship with you I don't want anything to keep us apart [Applause] God's faithful heart moves on our heart to bring faithfulness if I can say it like this we are faithful because he is faithful we love him because he first loved [Applause] usall Hallelujah that's why the prophet said don't ever look at yourself he said as a matter of fact he said when he's holding a little baby dedicating it he said I used to think about oh just how innocent this child is he said but do you realize that each one that's born of the spirit of God you're more innocent than the baby that I'm holding the dedicated because the new birth takes you beyond natural birth Stay With Me Now oh my you know when you when sin is confessed it goes when it's confessed it goes right in the bleach that God has provided and can I refer to one statement I got to looking at this again and it about turned me around and around brother Bram said you can't even find one spot of bleach on him oh you know what that means it'd be like if I had on my pants right here and somehow you know if I spilled bleach on them you'd be able to see the spot for sure but you see what happens is the bleach of God the blood that God himself created for you and I When sin is confessed that bleach that blood of Jesus Christ has the power to break sin hold and it sends it way on back till it falls on to the accuser Satan himself brother he's got a lot to answer [Applause] for hallelujah hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ loosens us [Applause] completely Hallelujah the Prophet could say it like this and be certain of God he said job could say he said when the accusations would come his way job I know job you've got something in your heart that you haven't confessed and job said no I hadn't done it I've confessed at all there was no condemnation right you know the Bible tells that job said my heart will not reproach me you know if if our heart condemn us God's greater than our heart and know it's all thing aren't you glad friends for conviction let me tell you why you got that conviction the prophet said that if you'd go to do something wrong there's something that'll ring out and then if there's something that is wrong that has been done wrong he said you can't stay there you can't dwell in that you've got to come make that right that's right that's because they're listen you know why that is that's a part of God that's right that a listen that ain't because you're a good person that's right that's right I I I go through a whole Litany of quotes on all of this but if our heart condem see that's what Satan wants to do he wants to hang things over if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God if you've done what God has asked you said well Brother Sam if I've fallen short but remember confession belongs to you as a Believer come on friends we've got a right to every Redemptive blessing we've got a right to the Holy Ghost we got a right to Deliverance but don't ever forget your right to repentance we've got a right to repentance that's so good Hallelujah I tell you what a wonderful privilege it is to be able to stand there and to know that we're not coming as Beggars hoping that he will forgive us oh my then we have confidence toward God you know what when we have confidence then we become a channel that's waiting on inspiration to fall our heart everything all the mechanics are laid in order I'm just waiting on the Dynamics to drop why because we keep his commandment all the mechanics and do those things that are pleasing in his sight pleasing in his sight that means even if there's something that comes in my mind that may not be expressed out here but I can say Lord forgive me for that thought maybe a thought against a brother against a sister this or that but I want to do what's pleasing in his sight because when I do what's pleasing in his sight God saw all this about job but others saw what God saw the confidence in job we want to do what's pleasing in his sight cuz you know what it'll it'll reflect outwardly sure don't you love the Lord watch this I have heard but now see oh my I just love this message brother BR said notice he said when everybody ex respected his wisdom he had become so great his inspiration from God had Vindicated him to be God's servant so plainly until the people come from everywhere to hear him and then Satan begin to accuse that man and that's the way he does every inspired servant of God Satan is always everybody say always always there to accuse him of everything he does that's not right always there right I want to just say this job wasn't sinless and perfect and upright and all of this because he was sinless it was because he had a perfect and clear confession before God he knew his right to confession it was the revelation of the burnt offering that kept him clean you might say well really Sam how could I make this this mistake but it's the Revelation that keeps you clean and says uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh uhuh that can't dwell in your life and what is it then you stand as a son and daughter of God and are Washed by the washing of Water by the word amen not only does it remove of of the sin of the offense but what it deals with is the guilt so you can go on and hold your head up high as a son and daughter of God awaiting on inspiration to strike Hallelujah confession y'all believe this right right let me just jump to verse n here because I want to try to get this moved up here if we confess notice if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins come on now he might he'll think about it he'll get back to us he is I love that not was not will be he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US 1 John 2 verse one my little children these things I write unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the pritu for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world Amen let's just read this prayer the prophet makes right here oh he says we do not want to try to enter into thy presence with sin Upon Us knowing that each day troubles and things besets us that might not even be noticed in our own thinking but when we come to think of a holy God who even angels are dirty in his sight then we know Lord that we have not a chance unless we come through the blood of Jesus Christ and then we are children of God our mistakes are overlooked as we confess them oh my no wonder no wonder the devil wants to get our thoughts going so many other ways I going to ask you to raise your hand but how many times you get down to pray and all of a sudden you let me check see if the dishwashers going y you know what let me check see the garage door must be open I don't want to live in not in this neighborhood my garage door is open no and is't it amazing how the things will come for you to do right you sit down you get ready to listen to a message and all then all of a sudden all of this starts running through your mind right right or you come and sit in the house of God you think praise God I made it and all of a sudden here you are sitting and there's something that just drops right down and trying to divert your mind you know why because when we think upon him then even the things that would be unknown to us in our mind when that examination would take place in our lives it keeps us in a place of real fellowship and real confidence no wonder the de no wonder God told Joshua meditate on these things how many of you know what I'm talking about when you go to start thinking about the Lord right his presence draws near it brother R says you start thinking on him he said all of a sudden you'll feel this he said that is the resurrection moving over you right there you Lord thinking upon the things of God I don't mind telling you brother and sister I'm just going to be honest as the day is long I thank God for those moments of Resurrection because there's things that I needed to be snapped out of sometimes there's thoughts of gloom and everything else and you start think thinking about him oh my sometimes we can get to thinking about how low we are and how this and how that and then all of a sudden we begin to think about God and I I believe it like this friends you can take it for whatever you think but I believe that the angels of God that are sent to minister to The Heirs at our Salvation this is why you want to have a life that's live clear before God because the angels are not ashamed to come where you're at and there's times my thoughts need hijacked and brought right back on the right track and begin to think on the mercies of God and you begin to dwell on it long enough and that's so good yes sir beauti look at this one oh he said we would ask this morning in the light of the sanctifying power of his blood that you would cleanse us from all our evil anything that we've done thought or said that was contrary to thee and father God we know that that would be many things for a great and holy God till even angels look dirty to him where would we stand but today we have the privilege of coming beyond the Angels because Jesus never died for angels and angels are servants and by the blood of Jesus we are Sons and Daughters of God and we come into thy presence to say thank you Father for what you've done for us and what you mean to us good hallelujah hallelujah a righteous man that's what job was he was a righteous man he had a testimony he was perfect but not in himself he was perfect am by the Revelation amen he was upright by the working of the Revelation in his life he was blameless by the working of the Revelation in his life and he es skewed es skewed means is that when he saw evil something was questionary and the buzzer starting to go on he turned away from it that's what a sketh evil Hallelujah that is so good you say sometimes I've been in some things and got turned around brother BR said that he said well he said let's like this it's like the crow and Dove was let out of the Ark he said God sometimes will let them two out like that and see he said but I'll tell you if you no longer have that Gall in you because the Holy Spirit has come in by the dove you cannot stay there cuz there's nothing to feed you and what means more to you than anything else is the word of God and you'll come right back to the ark yes that's why brother Ram said you take a person he said he said oh my they might get backel it he said but if they've ever been born again they'll never be happy anywhere else they're going to come back to the [Applause] ark now let me polish this next one up here or let him you go a righteous man James confess your faults one to another that don't mean going around and telling everybody everything right there you go but if you've done something that needs to be made right confess your faults maybe if there's a trusted brother or sister that God has given you as a comrade that they're not going to hear one thing and say I'll pray with you brother and turn around and spread it somewhere else I I believe I believe listen friends let me just tell you something like this you might have trouble taking your Mountain but I'm going to tell you the same God that gave me Grace to go into my Mountain is the same God that'll give you Grace to take yours if there's nothing more than I'm to stand here and say I'll stand right with you I'm going to stand right there and pray with you Oh Brother Sam you don't know the circumstance but I know the God who is a master above every circumstance I know a god who's greater than every circumstance and if he did it for me he'd do it for me anybody Hallelujah you believe that tonight confess your faults one to another pray for one another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the fervent one that's boiling up Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and 6 months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth for her fruit the prophet said a righteous man is not a sinless man but he said a man is a man that depends on his righteousness by confessing his wrongs to God hallelujah oh come on now there's another shell we're not righteous in that we're sinless but a righteous man is one who confesses his sins to a right righteous and holy God and believes by faith sometimes this is the challenge we confess our sins and then now you've got to take that faith if we confess our sins then you've got to accept the Forgiveness that God is extending sometimes it's hard for us to forgive ourselves it's hard to take the Forgiveness of the Lord and bring it back to our own life and we'll struggle with it wrestling with it but let me tell you something it's freely given it's a privilege that's afforded to you when sister Bruce stood there she said how can I possibly be the Bride of Jesus Christ I make so many mistakes he said sister Bruce that's what Calvary was for Calvary was for all of your mistakes your desire is to serve him and he's made a way so you could serve him he said think of this he said here I am am he said as a sinner he said but in his presence you and I are not Sinners any longer we stand as redeemed in his presence he only hears our voice coming through the blood he doesn't even see us well what's he seeing he's seeing the same thing that Nehemiah spoke of regarding Abraham Nehemiah spoke and said God thou found us Abraham's heart faith there you go what's the testimony of Abraham's life a faithful heart can I read one more somebody said please that's how I feel a righteous man is not a sinless man you notice he said Elijah Elijah had a man was a man subject to life passions as we are he had his ups and downs and his differences and the scripture of his life proves that he had ups and downs like we do he had times of wandering and his times that his temper got away from him he had a lot of things that went wrong but he was still a righteous man because he confessed his unworthiness and believed in God so that's what made him righteous we're not righteous within ourselves we're righteous through Jesus Christ I cannot be Sanctified within myself I am Sanctified through Jesus Christ who stands in the presence of God in my place it isn't my Holiness it's his Holiness my Holiness won't work at all but his does because God done accepted him and in accepting him he had to accept me because I'm in him Hallelujah that's what makes it real isn't it then we don't have to depend on ourselves last one brother BR said now that doesn't make us say we can sin anybody that's been redeemed you have no desire to sin there you go so true well we're we're not looking for we're not looking for a thing to do something oh if I wasn't a Christian no we the desire of sin is gone sure we still have all of this around our spirit and our flesh that's right but the desire within is gone our desire is to please God that doesn't make us say we can sin brother if you sin you're just away from God there's only one thing to do confess it and get right with God you see how simple that is Amen brother Ram takes that in a message perfect Faith he takes the message perfect faith and he says if there's condemnation in your in your heart get it right so you can get ready it's just that simple you don't have to labor on it just get it right what so that you're in position to receive that oh I love that as long as you desire to sin the desires of sin still in your heart then it's time to stay down at the altar till that thing's taken out now you will sin you're bound to sin cuz you just can't help it but not willful sin he that sins willfully after he received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but every day you're bound to sin and you're bound to be backsliding constantly oh I know the legalist hate these quotes that's right it's just so fearful that's going to make people slack the real gospel don't make people slack when it's presented and ministered in its Purity and Holiness and power how could you fail on a love like this what would you how what would you want to go away from a love like this that's presented to you you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes a constant prayer right right thus did job continually yes amen continually amen job how often continually Amen in other words job was like if you could say it his life was like on one of those he had his playlist set up and it was on continuous loop that's so good he had his favorite songs that's right and it was on continuous loop thus did job continually Paul said I Die daily and if Paul had to Die daily how much more am I going to have to stay there Dead all the time if Paul had to Die daily to stay right with God we'll have to do that just die out to yourself and that's getting God's way amen you love himl a faithful heart a faithful heart Hallelujah let's stand when it comes down to it on Rapture morning and we'll be standing there we won't be standing there because that we were sinless right we're going to be standing there just like we are today it's a faithful heart and a faithful heart is even when there's something that's out of line something that's a little off even a things sometimes that we may not even be aware of that has been done or said like brother Bram as he prayed that's just one little sample of it but it's a constant prayer before God if there's one thing that we could take in the scriptures that was the victory for job's life and his walk with God job had fellowship with God he was under the shed blood he had offered the burnt offering and job stayed with that continually listen friends we don't ever want to get Beyond a place because we can't brother BR said he had to stay there himself stay dead there a constant prayer even throughout the day sometimes you can't even steal away throughout the day sometimes you're right in the middle of your job sometimes thoughts come sometimes things come maybe things sometimes you you know are set a certain way you get under pressure in your home the circumstances of life and something just didn't sit right and you go back and say forgive me for saying that forgive me for saying it that way maybe what was said there was things but we I I said it in the wrong way forgive me you know what that is it's a constant confession it's not things we're just looking for you know we're not walking around just looking for things but it's staying in contact with God right and as Satan wants to so divert our thoughts no wonder he wants to take our thoughts so many different directions because when we begin to think of a holy God yeah that even as the prophet said angels look dirty in his sight but remember the blood of Jesus Christ Has Lifted us back into our rightful position and that constant confession keeping out condemnation from your life remember Satan's always going to be there to accuse you I read that quotee I have heard but now I see he's always to accuse job now now listen Satan had records he said this wrong right he thought this wrong as a matter of fact he actually became critical of somebody you say brother Samuel that's not written in the word you're right it's not but in the New Testament neither is Abraham's wrong written either that's right that's good you know why between the Old Testament and the New Testament came The Mercy Seat of God in plain view Cain Calvary you never read about Abraham's doubting you never read about Abraham lying you never read about that you know why because the blood took care of it so good he had confessed it and it took care of it you you know what the revealing of the word in this hour of the Lamb coming into our midst you know what's to do make a church ready for Rapture it's to get a people ready for Rapture to where every lean that the devil has against you said why they can't do this and they can't go there and they can't do this they can't do that but the blood speaks better things and when the token has been applied the prophet said the devil can come and tease it that seal he can punch at it try to make you think you're not when you are he said but you know the desires of your heart you knew what you were before and what you are now that's right you know the things you once used to love and the things you love now what are you standing on what are you standing on you're standing in the same place that job stood in a type you are standing in divine revelation in the antitype Christ Jesus as Sons and Daughters of God in Heavenly places yes sir and standing in Heavenly places you think the devil is not going to come and try to battle at you oh he's going to war he's going to try to do everything he can to pull us out of that to get us so focused down here into this realm when everything is said and done here we are standing and there's a bride that is standing alone amen upon the word excommunicated from fellowships of all other churches but she's standing upon the word of God she's heard his voice she's responded to the knock upon her heart and there is a fun there is a fellowship that is going on what a privilege it is friends to have a faithful heart Amen Let me just tell you something David said it like this in Psalms 130 Lord if thou would that thou wouldest Mark iniquities who could stand let me just let you know this God doesn't have a chart with tally marks of all your good days and another column of all your bad days that's right that's right Jesus Remember God cannot see you when your confession is in the blood right that's why brother B said he said you can't can't backslide on God you backslide on Christ because it's the blood of Christ that has cleansed you right if it wasn't for the blood of Christ the moment we did wrong remember it was like Sarah when Sarah said no I didn't laugh what was it it was her husband's faith that was standing for her that's the same thing that stands for you and I it's his life inside of you and I that sometimes when we're in a MST and we respond I didn't and yet we did we did where was it at we laugh in our heart sometimes there's things we've said in our heart aren't you glad that there's one who's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he don't just look on the outside and say you know what seems like everything is going good with Naomi she's got a nice cheery smile everything is good but God comes right down and he'll deal with the heart cuz you know what friends sometimes the way that we look at out here it's not how we feel in here absolutely sometimes we're just good actors I'm not saying anything wrong with that but you know what I'm glad that the word comes down to discern the heart right and I'm glad he comes and ministers to our hearts aren't you I'm glad that sometimes when we've got ourselves in a hole oh my sometimes in our thoughts depend on how you're made up oh my you can get I mean the devil can just start we laying on you and you're getting everything man you've done this wrong this wrong this wrong and this wrong and I'm not all together I'm not talking even about Sin necessarily I'm talking about things maybe decisions you've done this or you've done that and you've done this it's like you just feel like you're being way laid in a corner maybe I'm the only one but I don't think so but you know I'm thankful for the grace of God that will come in those moments now this is me I believe God permits those things so that we're able to be able to minister to one another oh yes not look and say brother Shane how could you get backed up in a corner like that no but to know that we pray for one another we don't go around and advertise it we don't go around and talk about it we don't post it on Instagram hey everybody pray for me today I'm in a corner and some of us were like that in school we were in Corners Corners were where we where we sat they were just that's our sign seating right brother Ray but Corners I'm just picking with him he he's the one that's told me all that stuff but you know sometimes on those Corners I need help out of them Corners yeah I need help you know why cuz we're still right here in this in my memory I can remember every one of my failures every one of my shortcomings and you think the devil don't want want to come around and try to point those things out but listen this is where Paul an apostle a prophet of God could say I have learned to forget those things which are behind and I'm reaching forward in other words that what all in the past has been confessed and it's placed under the blood I'm not not going to dwell there no longer it was like I'm sorry I got to tell that there was a lady that after the war ended between the North and the South she took General Lee and she got him and she walked him up back said come here took him around the property she showed him this tree she said look at this tree they shot it up there's bullet holes all in it it was a beautiful tree at one time look what they've done to it said what do you what do you think I should do he said lady cut it down and burn it and move on amen that's it sometimes that's the challenge right there we just need to hear that from God you know what quit going back to the same tree and Reminiscing on the same things cut it down and burn [Applause] it yes sir a faithful heart you love him yes sir amen you got something on your [Music] heart it is all under the blood of Jesus it's all under the he doesn't see all the wrong

sometimes we don't know what our brother or sister's going through or dealing with we don't know maybe it's sickness maybe it's a need in their life maybe victory over un besetting sin maybe it's a weit to be laid aside maybe it's torment that's going on in their mind maybe as you'd like to just slip out of your seat and find a sister I'd like us to if you wouldn't mind let's lay hands on one
