[38:21] and then in this hour it's just
[38:22] something
[38:23] there's something special about it
[38:25] you know when believers when we
[38:28] are able to get together
[38:30] it's just something special you know the
[38:32] song that we know it says
[38:34] we're together again just praising the
[38:36] lord
[38:38] something good is bound to happen
[38:41] something good is in store
[38:44] amen that's that's expectation we we
[38:47] have that confidence no matter how it is
[38:49] sometimes that we you know we go through
[38:52] things in life and there's things that
[38:53] we're facing things sometimes even in in
[38:56] our spirit we feel down
[38:59] but yet we have that expectation i can
[39:01] just get to the house of god
[39:03] i've got a hope he said brother samuel i
[39:05] thought it was faith but a hope remember
[39:08] faith gives us hope
[39:10] and a hope is an expectation
[39:12] we have an expectation that god
[39:14] is going to do something for us
[39:17] god's going to speak to our hearts he's
[39:18] going to minister to our lives now it
[39:20] may not come exactly the way that we're
[39:22] thinking about it but he's going to
[39:24] speak to our lives
[39:26] amen and that's what we have with just
[39:28] such a real joy in our hearts
[39:30] just so thankful amen for what god is
[39:33] doing to be a part of that amen in this
[39:35] hour we see everything that's going on
[39:37] within the world we see to see
[39:40] world powers and a lot of things i don't
[39:42] know if this is me or or what that is
[39:44] but
[39:45] it's being you know a mass and things
[39:47] like that in the earth
[39:49] and yet it's a time that when we're
[39:51] looking at that when the scripture said
[39:53] when you begin to see these things lift
[39:54] up your head for your redemption draw at
[39:57] night
[39:58] amen and we begin to see all of that
[40:02] things that are taking place and i'm
[40:04] grateful to god that there's a real
[40:06] peace that god gives to our lives
[40:09] i don't know but i i think i think this
[40:11] it might be me and if it is i apologize
[40:14] for that we'll we'll change up here if
[40:16] we have to
[40:18] but let's just look to the lord in a
[40:19] word of prayer

[44:02] i'm just going to read
[44:06] a few verses actually we'll read through
[44:09] verse 13 if you will
[44:13] but in luke chapter 11 verse 1
[44:16] it says and it came to pass that as he
[44:18] was praying
[44:19] in a certain place
[44:21] when he ceased
[44:23] one of his disciples said unto him lord
[44:26] teach us to pray as john also taught
[44:30] his disciples
[44:33] and he said unto them when you pray say
[44:35] our father
[44:37] which art in heaven
[44:38] hallowed be thy name
[44:40] thy kingdom come
[44:42] thy will be done as in heaven so
[44:46] in earth
[44:48] give us day by day
[44:50] our daily bread
[44:52] and forgive us our sins for we also
[44:54] forgive everyone that is indebted to us
[44:58] and lead us not into temptation but
[45:00] deliver us from evil
[45:02] and he said unto them which of you shall
[45:04] have a friend and shall go unto him at
[45:07] midnight
[45:08] and say unto him friend
[45:10] lend me three loaves
[45:13] god bless the reading of the word as
[45:14] you're being seated
[45:16] just continue reading from there
[45:20] for a friend of mine in his journey has
[45:23] come to me
[45:24] and i have nothing to set before him
[45:27] and he from within shall answer and say
[45:30] trouble me not the door is now shut and
[45:33] my children are with me in bed i cannot
[45:36] rise and give thee
[45:38] i say unto you though
[45:40] he will not rise and give him because he
[45:43] is his friend this is
[45:45] this is me i think just if you just
[45:48] switch it to this if you would please
[45:49] okay
[45:50] i'll turn this off
[45:52] i say unto you though we will not rise
[45:55] and give him because he is his friend
[45:58] yet because of his opportunity
[46:02] he will rise and give him as many
[46:06] as he needeth
[46:07] i want you to think of this this
[46:09] scripture here
[46:12] in the opening part here in verse 1
[46:17] the disciples
[46:18] seeing the life of the lord jesus now
[46:21] remember
[46:23] they have had a witness as far as
[46:26] knowing and believing of all that they
[46:29] can see at that moment that this is the
[46:31] messiah
[46:33] we know there are events that took place
[46:35] in the crucifixion
[46:37] and there of the resurrection that was
[46:39] hidden and to be revealed in another
[46:42] moment
[46:44] but there was there was that insight
[46:46] that window
[46:48] into his life that if you were to ask
[46:50] them
[46:52] in the in the
[46:53] um layout
[46:55] of the life of the lord jesus they would
[46:58] tell you he spent much time in prayer
[47:02] over and over in the book of luke it's
[47:04] recorded ten times he was in prayer
[47:09] and we recognize that within this
[47:11] in verse 1 when they saw this
[47:15] they seen the effectual working
[47:18] but they're asking him teach us to pray
[47:20] as john taught his disciples also you
[47:23] see the teaching of it was more than
[47:26] just about
[47:27] praying of how to how to put your body
[47:30] because they these
[47:31] these were israelites
[47:33] they knew about you know the different
[47:36] things of prayer and so forth they knew
[47:38] about that
[47:39] they knew the different prayers they
[47:41] weren't ignorant of that remember simon
[47:44] was even spoke to by his father in
[47:47] regards looking for the messiah here's
[47:49] what moses has said unto the spirit of
[47:51] god that the lord that god shall raise a
[47:53] prophet like and unto me he was taught
[47:55] those things so they weren't ignorant of
[47:57] prayer but you see what's being said in
[47:59] verse one is is inspire to us direct us
[48:04] into what we need to be asking for right
[48:07] now
[48:09] you see because our lives lives itself
[48:11] it goes by so quickly
[48:14] and i'm going to deal with some of this
[48:15] here tonight and what i want to speak on
[48:17] is time well spent the life goes by so
[48:22] quickly
[48:23] and yet here it is they're asking him
[48:25] which is a great question and brother
[48:27] branham takes that and i read that to
[48:29] you out of feast of the trumpets where
[48:30] he's praying and asking god lord teach
[48:33] us the things for us to ask that would
[48:36] be beneficiary for your kingdom's sake
[48:39] and it's so it's not about us it's about
[48:42] him
[48:43] and we recognize that when we have that
[48:45] set even in that priority it will affect
[48:48] and give us direction in the lives that
[48:50] we live down here john taught his
[48:52] disciples on what to pray for see the
[48:55] word being ministered actually brought
[48:59] forth what they should be praying for at
[49:01] that moment that's the same way it was
[49:03] with daniel when daniel understood by
[49:06] the books the inspiration came and
[49:08] daniel began to pray he began to confess
[49:11] his sin confess the sin of the people
[49:13] and begin to make supplication unto god
[49:16] so it shows that prayer itself is is
[49:20] that which is very directed with god and
[49:24] god is the one who's directing it in our
[49:27] lives
[49:28] if we can just be sensitive like as we
[49:30] looked at here a month ago a month and a
[49:33] half or what have you when we looked at
[49:34] jesus took took him to the field and he
[49:37] says the harvest is right
[49:39] and he says pray ye the lord of harvest
[49:41] he'll send laborers into the vineyard
[49:44] and remember jesus himself he's standing
[49:46] as the lord of the harvest he knew what
[49:48] they needed
[49:50] but you see they had to ask for it
[49:54] god just doesn't give it without being
[49:56] asked for it
[49:57] and i want you to take notice of this
[49:59] scripture here as we're reading
[50:02] uh this is no doubt a very familiar
[50:04] scripture to us but i want you to
[50:06] consider here is one
[50:08] going one friend going to another friend
[50:11] and it's going at midnight it's not
[50:13] somewhat of a convenient hour i don't
[50:15] know about you
[50:16] but you know
[50:18] knocking at that time of the night maybe
[50:20] in my house one thing you may get riled
[50:22] up is dogs
[50:24] i mean i'm up once in a while i mean a
[50:26] lot of times you know the way the
[50:27] schedule i probably would be up at
[50:29] midnight
[50:30] but to understand what it is it's a time
[50:33] that's not convenient
[50:35] are you hearing me now
[50:37] it's about something that's not
[50:39] convenient
[50:40] but it's about there's a need and this
[50:43] person recognizes that regardless of the
[50:46] hour this is a need and the other friend
[50:50] on the inside who's able to give what's
[50:53] being asked for is not rising up out of
[50:56] his bed to give the friend the bread
[51:00] that he needs but he's rising up because
[51:03] of his friend's importunity or his
[51:06] shamelessness in asking
[51:10] i tell you if there's anything that we
[51:11] need to be and the scriptures would show
[51:14] us as believers is to be shameless in
[51:17] our asking when god speaks to our heart
[51:20] to ask god and you know like brother
[51:22] brad who told us he said ask god for big
[51:25] things he wants you to ask for big
[51:27] things and he says a matter of fact the
[51:28] big things are just as easy as the
[51:31] little things
[51:33] now think of this as the scripture
[51:36] is set here it says now i say unto you
[51:39] ask and it shall be given you
[51:43] seek and you shall find
[51:45] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[51:50] brother branham dramatized this
[51:51] scripture for us and he speaks to us in
[51:54] this manner that he says it's one that's
[51:56] standing right there and saying papa
[51:58] it's me again
[52:00] i'm not leaving
[52:01] until this prayer is answered you got me
[52:04] on your hands right now there's a need
[52:07] that i've got right here i i've got a
[52:09] need you know what that is that's
[52:11] desperation and knowing that it's only
[52:14] god that can meet that need
[52:16] he will not rise up because of being a
[52:19] friend he will rise up because of our
[52:21] shamelessness in saying thou alone are
[52:24] able to do this work lord and i need
[52:27] your touch lord i need a move of god
[52:30] right now in my life he will rise
[52:34] he will rise and answer
[52:36] for everyone that asketh receiveth
[52:40] i think we just ought to say amen to
[52:42] that
[52:44] and he that seeketh findeth
[52:48] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[52:50] open you know what that scripture verse
[52:52] 10 has on it time
[52:56] time
[52:58] because it takes time to seek for things
[53:01] i mean i know we're living in an hour
[53:02] right now you can't find it just order
[53:04] it on amazon it'll be here
[53:05] in the next hour
[53:08] but look what that also does in our
[53:09] lives
[53:12] it creates even though we're not we're
[53:15] not in a place where i don't want to be
[53:17] impatient but things around us
[53:21] work to create an impatience
[53:24] and prayer is not instant mashed
[53:26] potatoes
[53:29] sometimes prayer you've gotta it's plant
[53:31] the potatoes water the potatoes and then
[53:34] harvest the potatoes
[53:36] and then take them in and make them
[53:39] without microwave
[53:42] that's prayer
[53:44] this is why prayer coupled with patience
[53:47] and patience
[53:49] is that of faith
[53:51] that's why jesus said with patience
[53:53] possess ye your souls i mean we want
[53:56] patience
[53:58] right now
[54:01] time time and money is time time time
[54:04] time
[54:05] you know we hear that we hear that
[54:07] expressed time time time
[54:10] if a son i want you to look at this if a
[54:13] son shall ask bread of any of you that
[54:15] is a father
[54:16] will he give him a stone or if he ask a
[54:19] fish will he will he for a fish give him
[54:21] a serpent or or if he shall ask an egg
[54:25] will he offer him a scorpion
[54:28] if you then being evil know how to give
[54:30] good gifts unto your children how much
[54:33] more shall your heavenly father give the
[54:35] holy spirit to them to ask him
[54:40] amen
[54:41] it's a desire it's the asking that that
[54:45] in itself for that of the holy ghost for
[54:47] healing for all those things that with
[54:49] every need that we have because inside
[54:52] of christ every redemptive blessing is
[54:55] to the believer
[54:57] every redemptive blessing
[54:59] and things that even in this hour we
[55:02] understand we're not praying for a
[55:05] revival to strike the nation we've been
[55:07] taught by the spirit of god the message
[55:10] has come to us and we are praying should
[55:13] be praying for rapture
[55:15] god that i'll be counted worthy to
[55:17] escape lord that my life is found lined
[55:20] up lord oh lord i want my life to be
[55:23] right in step with you lord god amen
[55:26] oh my it's examination time it's
[55:30] examining hour it's it's calling on god
[55:33] for that word to be made manifest in our
[55:36] life
[55:38] and think about this
[55:40] you know when we look at here with
[55:43] things and i want you to think of just
[55:44] some terms here
[55:46] this evening i want you to think of some
[55:49] terms here of interest
[55:52] investment
[55:54] need and priority
[55:56] brother braham says it like this it's
[55:58] just so this quote is always just your
[56:00] soul but so dear to my heart
[56:03] and out of the pergaming age brother
[56:04] brahman says i wonder if we are
[56:07] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[56:10] our midst
[56:11] so let me give you a thought here
[56:13] how do we pray
[56:15] we pray in jesus name don't we every
[56:18] prayer is in his name or there isn't any
[56:20] answer
[56:21] yet in 1st john 5 14 we are told this is
[56:24] the confidence that we have in him that
[56:26] if we ask anything according to his will
[56:29] he heareth us
[56:30] and if we know that he hear us
[56:32] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[56:34] the petitions that we've desired of him
[56:36] now we ask what is the will of god
[56:39] there's only one way to know his will
[56:41] and that is by the word of god
[56:44] lamentations 3 37 who is he that sayeth
[56:47] and it cometh to past when the lord
[56:49] commandeth it not there it is if it
[56:52] isn't in the word you can't have it so
[56:55] we can't ask unless it's in the word and
[56:58] we can't petition or ask unless it is in
[57:01] his name there it is again
[57:03] jesus the name is the word which is his
[57:06] will you can't separate god and the word
[57:10] they are one
[57:13] i know you know getting this hour and it
[57:16] seems to be i don't know i'm not sure
[57:19] why
[57:20] confusion about what the absolute is
[57:23] but it's very clear what the absolute is
[57:25] it's the revelation
[57:27] of jesus christ
[57:30] paul said the we or an angel come from
[57:32] heaven and preach any other gospel
[57:36] brother branham put it like this he said
[57:37] paul was saying if i come around and say
[57:40] something different than he has already
[57:42] said through my ministry then you count
[57:44] me a curse
[57:46] showing he said paul was pointing out to
[57:48] us that it is the revelation that we
[57:51] have confidence in and if we have
[57:53] confidence in the revelation and it is
[57:55] the revelation it will do what it
[57:58] highlights and anchors within the word
[58:00] of god
[58:01] noah didn't have a bible
[58:03] job didn't have a bible come on now i
[58:05] know we want to say the stars and so
[58:06] forth but you realize brother rem said
[58:08] what they had was the revelation and
[58:11] that's the most important thing
[58:13] because we realize a person could have
[58:15] the written word and not have the
[58:17] revelation
[58:18] but it's a revelation that brings us in
[58:21] contact with god and it's a revelation
[58:24] that has prevailing power within it it
[58:27] brings the absolute in our lives which
[58:30] is unlimited in its power
[58:34] what that says is that it's unlimited of
[58:36] what god will do
[58:39] paul said now unto him who's able to do
[58:42] abundantly exceeding above all that we
[58:44] could ask or think
[58:47] there's nothing that even now or if time
[58:50] tarries that can rise that's greater
[58:54] than god coming on the scene and meeting
[58:55] that need
[58:57] come on friends there's nothing can rise
[58:59] nothing is greater than god where we
[59:01] can't take and stand on the promise of
[59:04] god's word every opposition that comes
[59:06] every trial every test every adversity
[59:09] every sickness is a challenge are we
[59:11] going to stand on god's word
[59:14] amen
[59:17] we have been made i'll say it this way
[59:19] we have been made priests and kings unto
[59:22] our god
[59:24] we didn't take this to ourselves
[59:28] we didn't make ourselves that
[59:30] just as paul said aaron
[59:32] no man taketh this calling to himself
[59:35] we didn't do this
[59:37] but god has made known
[59:39] through revealing himself in our life
[59:42] it's god who's been his rich in mercy
[59:45] and as a priest of god i want you to
[59:47] think about this for a moment as a
[59:48] priest of god we are consecrated to
[59:51] please him
[59:53] serve him
[59:55] love him and live for him
[59:57] we're not our own we've been bought with
[59:59] the price
[1:00:01] there in israel the priest did not
[1:00:03] decide of when to come and go and say
[1:00:06] well you know what today's a bad day i'm
[1:00:08] not going to be able to be there in the
[1:00:09] tabernacle
[1:00:11] it wasn't about them
[1:00:14] i mean they might have been able to say
[1:00:15] in their tent i'll just catch it in my
[1:00:17] tent then one about them
[1:00:20] are you hearing me now i'm preaching
[1:00:23] it wasn't about them
[1:00:25] it was about the body and god said i
[1:00:28] have redeemed them i purchased them unto
[1:00:31] myself that tribe
[1:00:33] that out of all the other tribes this
[1:00:35] was a tribe that would be in god's
[1:00:38] dwelling place to serve him and to
[1:00:40] minister on behalf of the people of god
[1:00:43] you and i as the bride of jesus christ
[1:00:46] you know we get to looking at it and we
[1:00:48] sometimes we're looking at all the bride
[1:00:50] of jesus christ it's a great
[1:00:51] responsibility we are brought in as
[1:00:54] priests of god to please him to love him
[1:00:57] to serve him that's what's exhibited or
[1:00:59] to be exhibited out of our life
[1:01:02] where we've laid down our lives lay down
[1:01:05] the things of the world it's not about
[1:01:08] us you hearing me now
[1:01:11] it's not about us
[1:01:13] it's about him it's about his body amen
[1:01:17] that's why when a person gets you know
[1:01:18] they get you know somewhat upset at this
[1:01:21] one or this one and pull away it's about
[1:01:23] you you're making it about you it's not
[1:01:25] about you it's not about me it's about
[1:01:27] the body it's about jesus christ
[1:01:32] i can set it home and i can stream it
[1:01:34] the prince of god comes in there i know
[1:01:36] i've had to do that at a time but it's
[1:01:38] not about you it's about the body
[1:01:41] it's not about you or me it's about the
[1:01:44] body of jesus christ for sake not to
[1:01:48] assemble ourselves together as the
[1:01:50] manner of some art
[1:01:52] come on friends
[1:01:57] oh my
[1:01:58] we're priests and kings
[1:02:01] unto god
[1:02:02] we don't live our life for ourselves
[1:02:04] we've been purchased and redeemed for
[1:02:06] service in the things of god
[1:02:09] this is why paul could write
[1:02:11] in romans 12 1 i beseech you therefore
[1:02:14] brethren by the mercies of god that ye
[1:02:17] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:02:22] holy
[1:02:23] acceptable unto god
[1:02:25] which is your reasonable service
[1:02:27] think about what responsibility that
[1:02:29] brings to you and i
[1:02:33] the pastor won't do it for us
[1:02:35] the prophet won't do it for us the lord
[1:02:38] jesus won't do it for us
[1:02:40] all of this has been made a way that we
[1:02:42] can come and live
[1:02:44] in this place of presenting and it's not
[1:02:47] just one-time presentation we are made
[1:02:50] priests of god
[1:02:52] and the sacrifice is the offering up of
[1:02:54] our lives
[1:02:57] that we would present our own bodies
[1:03:00] a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:03:03] god which is your reasonable service now
[1:03:05] notice this admonition in verse 2 and be
[1:03:08] not conformed
[1:03:09] to this world
[1:03:12] pressured
[1:03:14] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:03:17] of your mind that you might prove what
[1:03:19] is that good
[1:03:21] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:03:28] i want to just go into this scripture
[1:03:29] here i'm just going to skip here just
[1:03:31] some other scriptures i want to go right
[1:03:32] to matthew 6 6.
[1:03:36] but thou
[1:03:38] when thou prayest
[1:03:40] yes amen
[1:03:42] enter into the closet
[1:03:46] and when thou has shut the door thy door
[1:03:49] notice
[1:03:50] thy door
[1:03:52] how many knows sometimes we've got to
[1:03:53] shut our door
[1:03:56] he said brother sam i always shut my
[1:03:57] bedroom door now i'm talking about the
[1:03:58] door many times of our own mind
[1:04:02] the door of our own the doings and
[1:04:04] everything we've got on our mind to say
[1:04:07] oh god just like the curtain dropped
[1:04:10] upon my soul and the world was sealed
[1:04:12] out and i was sealed in i need that
[1:04:15] curtain to drop right now lord
[1:04:18] and we enter in we begin to enter in and
[1:04:21] worshiping and because we realize
[1:04:24] we must enter in to his presence
[1:04:27] and it's entered to enter speaks there's
[1:04:30] a designated place now i realize that
[1:04:32] every one of us we no doubt have maybe
[1:04:35] you have a place in your home that's a
[1:04:37] designated place of where you go when
[1:04:39] you pray
[1:04:41] sometimes it might be different rooms
[1:04:43] multiple rooms
[1:04:45] you know
[1:04:46] when you have kids it narrows down
[1:04:50] but at any rate
[1:04:52] this is more than just
[1:04:54] a bedroom a closet
[1:04:57] there's a designated place that god has
[1:05:00] provided for you and i my lord
[1:05:03] and that's in jesus christ
[1:05:05] that we can enter into that presence
[1:05:08] that has so changed and transformed our
[1:05:10] lives i hope you're hearing me now
[1:05:12] tonight
[1:05:13] then it's not confined to oh i can only
[1:05:16] feel his presence when i get in my
[1:05:18] prayer closer or my bedroom but in
[1:05:20] reality we and i are able to walk with
[1:05:24] god in communion i'm telling you friends
[1:05:26] i've had wonderful experiences sometimes
[1:05:28] right in the middle of the store because
[1:05:30] already our lives was already in tune
[1:05:33] with god and his presence something just
[1:05:35] drops right there
[1:05:38] so communion prayer is not a on off on
[1:05:41] off on it's not a switch
[1:05:44] pray without ceasing amen
[1:05:46] that means that that means is is that
[1:05:49] there isn't breaks in our communication
[1:05:52] with god
[1:05:54] there might be times where we have more
[1:05:56] time than other times
[1:06:00] but you got to watch that because that
[1:06:02] it don't become a pattern
[1:06:04] come on we're still walking in this
[1:06:06] flesh
[1:06:07] we must mortify the deeds
[1:06:10] of this body
[1:06:11] and as priest of god we we enter in to
[1:06:14] his presence and i want you to see in
[1:06:16] the scripture says enter into thy closet
[1:06:19] and when thou has shut the door
[1:06:21] pray to the father which is in secret
[1:06:24] and thy father which seeth in secret
[1:06:27] shall reward thee openly
[1:06:29] his secret
[1:06:31] it has been made known to you and i
[1:06:33] right
[1:06:34] we're not it's not in the darkness it's
[1:06:36] not obscure
[1:06:38] the secret is where that he has revealed
[1:06:41] himself in his word
[1:06:44] he has made himself known to you and i
[1:06:48] remember jesus could he would walk right
[1:06:50] by many and they didn't know who he was
[1:06:53] it was a secret god was in christ
[1:06:57] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:07:00] it was a secret yet it was right out in
[1:07:02] the open yes amen is that right so the
[1:07:06] secret it speaks of that revealing where
[1:07:09] god has opened to you and i the father
[1:07:12] who seeth in secret you've got one who
[1:07:15] stands here as our high priest of his
[1:07:17] own word that the things that you and i
[1:07:20] are privileged to be able to approach
[1:07:22] the living god he doesn't send there
[1:07:24] with ooh ah oh my he's there
[1:07:28] to move on our behalf
[1:07:31] whatever you have need of and god deals
[1:07:34] and he strikes with our heart whether
[1:07:36] it's in a service or whether it's on a
[1:07:38] monday morning or a tuesday morning
[1:07:40] you've got an instant access with the
[1:07:43] lord jesus let me tell you something his
[1:07:46] phone is never on vibrate
[1:07:49] hallelujah his phone is never on do not
[1:07:52] disturb him
[1:07:54] but his ears are open his eyes are upon
[1:07:58] us
[1:07:59] he knows what you and i have need of
[1:08:03] oh my this is why when entering into
[1:08:07] prayer i wonder i want you to think of
[1:08:09] this he will reward the openly there's a
[1:08:11] return
[1:08:13] in your investment
[1:08:16] there's a return in your investment
[1:08:20] this is why paul would admonish the
[1:08:22] believers and colossians to seek those
[1:08:24] things which are above set
[1:08:26] your affections on things that are above
[1:08:29] brother branham would say it like this
[1:08:31] he would say you know and i read this
[1:08:33] quote to you i want to pull out a few
[1:08:35] points from here tonight out of blind
[1:08:37] bartimaeus and he speaks of how there's
[1:08:39] many
[1:08:41] there's something about getting alone to
[1:08:43] yourself
[1:08:45] now
[1:08:46] brother brown may talk about getting a
[1:08:48] loan to ourself and getting on our phone
[1:08:49] and he's talking about getting a loan to
[1:08:51] ourselves
[1:08:53] many people he said never pray until
[1:08:55] they come to church and many people
[1:08:57] think the only place to pray
[1:08:59] is at church but the bible said pray
[1:09:01] everywhere lifting up holy hands
[1:09:03] and when we get by ourselves you know
[1:09:05] we'll usually pray different than what
[1:09:06] we would if we prayed in church
[1:09:08] it's a secret prayer that jesus spoke of
[1:09:11] and he saying and brother brown quotes
[1:09:13] that scripture
[1:09:14] brother bram said when we're praying
[1:09:15] like that there seems to be something to
[1:09:17] the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy
[1:09:19] out of it it seems like we get in a
[1:09:22] better connection with god to get along
[1:09:26] so there's many places look the walk
[1:09:29] with a believer in communion with god is
[1:09:32] not an on and off as we said it's not
[1:09:34] just saying well i can't contact him
[1:09:36] outside of you know the walls of my
[1:09:39] bedroom no
[1:09:40] you any place you can contact god amen
[1:09:44] but let's just be honest there are some
[1:09:46] times where i've been in places that
[1:09:48] it's a little harder to pull into a gear
[1:09:54] oh yeah
[1:09:55] thank god for some of these noise
[1:09:56] blocking headphones
[1:09:59] never again i was getting ready for a
[1:10:01] service to minister you know here the
[1:10:03] first part of last year and i'm right
[1:10:05] i'm getting ready to go in and minister
[1:10:07] a sunday evening service and right
[1:10:09] outside of the hotel room right there i
[1:10:11] thought there was a brawl taking place
[1:10:13] it wasn't a shady hotel either
[1:10:16] but i mean it was like i mean all the
[1:10:18] swearing and ungodly words and
[1:10:20] everything i didn't know i thought it
[1:10:22] was going to go out the window
[1:10:25] but you know what all that was for is to
[1:10:27] try to upset my spirit amen
[1:10:31] you know why the enemy bombards you with
[1:10:33] different things is to try to upset your
[1:10:35] spirit
[1:10:37] and what's the same well here you get
[1:10:39] yourself settled down but you realize
[1:10:41] that anything in the world the world
[1:10:43] doesn't settle us down
[1:10:45] you say well brother branham went
[1:10:47] hunting right here in this quote brother
[1:10:48] graham says many of many of the men i
[1:10:50] was with thought i was climbing the
[1:10:52] mountain early in the morning to go
[1:10:53] hunting he said i wasn't going up there
[1:10:55] alone to go hunting i was going up there
[1:10:57] to contact god
[1:11:02] sometimes you just have to have good
[1:11:04] excuses
[1:11:07] glory be to god i got another call
[1:11:09] coming in you do yeah jesus is on the
[1:11:11] line
[1:11:12] [Applause]
[1:11:14] come on friends
[1:11:16] you know these things that we we find we
[1:11:19] get a better connection to get along and
[1:11:21] there's many times in my life it's
[1:11:22] perhaps in your life he says that you
[1:11:24] just have to get alone once in a while
[1:11:26] with jesus oh he said that being alone
[1:11:29] it's there that when the greatest
[1:11:31] revelation and inspiration comes is when
[1:11:34] we're alone with god
[1:11:35] we'd take more time on that
[1:11:38] that's a big statement if we take more
[1:11:40] time on that i'm sure that we would live
[1:11:44] a better life
[1:11:45] a more victorious life in christ
[1:11:50] now matthew 14 22
[1:11:54] and straightway
[1:11:56] jesus constrained his disciples to get
[1:11:58] into a ship
[1:12:00] and to go before him
[1:12:02] unto the other side while he sent
[1:12:04] the multitudes away
[1:12:06] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[1:12:09] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[1:12:12] and when the evening was come
[1:12:14] he was there
[1:12:16] alone
[1:12:17] i want you to think of this
[1:12:19] he sent the multitudes away
[1:12:26] he sent him away
[1:12:28] he sent his disciples away now let's
[1:12:30] just look at this
[1:12:32] the disciples were closer than the
[1:12:34] multitude
[1:12:36] right
[1:12:37] let's just bring it down to our own life
[1:12:39] fellowship is fine fellowship is good
[1:12:43] fellowship is necessary but fellowship
[1:12:45] should never
[1:12:47] with one another should never be above
[1:12:49] prayer
[1:12:52] if there's one that we men we want to
[1:12:54] make sure that we have an insane
[1:12:57] fellowship with that's the lord jesus
[1:12:59] and when we're in fellowship with him
[1:13:01] guess what we'll be refreshing to others
[1:13:05] are you with me
[1:13:08] separated i want you to think look at
[1:13:10] this he was separated
[1:13:13] in order
[1:13:14] to close off and to get into prayer
[1:13:18] you remember in the scripture where it
[1:13:20] speaks
[1:13:22] of how that anna she was a widow
[1:13:26] she was in the temple
[1:13:27] praying and fasting
[1:13:30] she was a widow
[1:13:33] she didn't have any other duties or
[1:13:35] responsibilities
[1:13:37] she had been mad you know her husband
[1:13:39] had passed on
[1:13:41] mary mary is grown now mary is 18 years
[1:13:43] old
[1:13:45] right
[1:13:47] she or she is
[1:13:49] i would say that if we could look at
[1:13:51] this with anna remember she was one that
[1:13:54] was part of the overcomers in that day
[1:13:58] and she was able to be there and to give
[1:14:01] herself into prayer
[1:14:03] think about zacharias zacharias had a
[1:14:05] responsibility as part of the priesthood
[1:14:08] to be in the temple and offering insects
[1:14:10] at certain times
[1:14:13] there was a responsibility
[1:14:15] but now as it comes to you and i let me
[1:14:17] read you this scripture first
[1:14:19] corinthians 7 5 this is speaking of
[1:14:21] husband and wife
[1:14:24] defraud you not one another except it be
[1:14:26] with consent for a time that you may
[1:14:29] give yourselves to fasting and prayer
[1:14:32] and come together again that satan
[1:14:34] tempts you not for your incontinency
[1:14:38] so now now once you think of this not
[1:14:40] only now you're a son of god a daughter
[1:14:43] of god a husband and wife and here you
[1:14:46] know they had their walks in the lord
[1:14:48] and now here they stand as husband and
[1:14:50] wife before if they wanted to go in
[1:14:53] praying and fasting they didn't have to
[1:14:54] tell nobody
[1:14:57] are you with me
[1:14:58] but now paul says the responsibility it
[1:15:01] falls to the husband or to the wife to
[1:15:03] have that mutual agreement to say hey
[1:15:06] there's some things i just want to give
[1:15:08] myself to prayer and fasting for right
[1:15:10] now just so what so that it keeps satan
[1:15:14] out of the way and out of the mind
[1:15:17] are you with me
[1:15:18] so there's a responsibility because a
[1:15:20] husband and a wife paul deals with that
[1:15:22] in that chapter as they are to one
[1:15:24] another but yet to recognize that there
[1:15:27] are times that we step aside in prayer
[1:15:30] and fasting and that should be openly
[1:15:33] declared and known
[1:15:35] this is where brother brown would say
[1:15:38] regarding the lord jesus
[1:15:41] he spent much time brother ryan would
[1:15:42] say this he would say this over and over
[1:15:45] and there's just certain things i just
[1:15:47] kept looking over these here just kept
[1:15:49] looking over and just just waiting and
[1:15:51] how the holy spirit would just quicken
[1:15:53] the different parts to it brother
[1:15:55] branham made this statement like this
[1:15:56] and i don't think i put this one on the
[1:15:58] screen but he says our loving savior had
[1:16:00] spent much time he's talking about
[1:16:02] before he went to jairus's house he had
[1:16:05] spent much time in prayer listen to this
[1:16:07] statement he was busy
[1:16:09] all the time
[1:16:13] that's a powerful statement
[1:16:16] busy all the time moving from place to
[1:16:19] place
[1:16:20] he didn't have any airplanes or
[1:16:23] he didn't have rail cars he
[1:16:25] they walked
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] they didn't have the state-of-the-art
[1:16:31] shoes
[1:16:32] oh this fits the arch just right in this
[1:16:36] right
[1:16:38] so in other words
[1:16:39] here his life it was busy but what was
[1:16:42] he busy about the father's business
[1:16:45] now listen to me now
[1:16:46] all of that the maniac of gather
[1:16:49] gadara all those things that you could
[1:16:51] line all the way out but remember
[1:16:54] brother branham would point us to this
[1:16:55] place he says he spent much time in
[1:16:58] prayer for these things that was before
[1:17:00] him not just for them but he spent much
[1:17:03] time in prayer and this was a result
[1:17:09] it's not us praying we understand it's
[1:17:12] not praying to gain merits
[1:17:15] but he was in prayer because the burden
[1:17:18] of the hour was upon him if his
[1:17:21] disciples were asking him teach us how
[1:17:23] to pray he knew how to pray he knew what
[1:17:28] to be asking for in that hour he knew
[1:17:30] what the promise was for that hour are
[1:17:33] you with me it was quickened to him of
[1:17:35] isaiah 53 he bore up our infirmities
[1:17:38] carried away our sicknesses that was
[1:17:40] quickened to him and he knew that he
[1:17:42] needed the strength of his father in him
[1:17:45] to perform that word
[1:17:48] is that right the son can do nothing in
[1:17:50] himself but what he seeth the father
[1:17:53] doing that doeth the son likewise
[1:17:56] whole glory be to god he was busy all
[1:17:59] the time but remember
[1:18:00] moses let's go to moses moses was busy
[1:18:03] too
[1:18:04] but moses got too busy
[1:18:07] that he forgot circumcision
[1:18:10] so sometimes busyness is always not
[1:18:12] about bad things
[1:18:15] it can be good things
[1:18:18] moses could have argued with god lord
[1:18:20] you're the one who called me to stand as
[1:18:23] a deliverer to these people
[1:18:25] that god also could speak to moses and
[1:18:27] say
[1:18:28] but that does not
[1:18:30] that does not alleviate you from walking
[1:18:32] in a balance of your time
[1:18:36] but god i'm to be a deliverer but moses
[1:18:38] you're also a father
[1:18:41] you're also a husband
[1:18:43] hello
[1:18:44] those things were not taken from you but
[1:18:46] now you must bring them in and ask god
[1:18:48] lord how do i balance all of this
[1:18:50] friends that's just not for ministry
[1:18:52] that's for all of our lives because
[1:18:54] there's things sometimes it comes our
[1:18:56] way and we have to ask god how do i
[1:18:59] balance all of this
[1:19:02] what if you will if i can say it this
[1:19:03] way what is the fact that can be trimmed
[1:19:06] out of my life
[1:19:09] are you with me and being honest with
[1:19:11] god what are some things i could cut out
[1:19:13] that's not necessary
[1:19:18] he spent much time in prayer before the
[1:19:20] cross the bible says he prayed earnestly
[1:19:25] before going to the cross
[1:19:28] that's right that was his destiny
[1:19:31] but he prayed earnestly
[1:19:36] strengthened for that moment
[1:19:40] in luke 6 12.
[1:19:42] i've referred to this one many times
[1:19:44] and it came to pass in those days this
[1:19:46] is what brother brown was referring to
[1:19:48] he went out into a mountain to pray and
[1:19:50] continued all night in prayer
[1:19:52] to god
[1:19:55] brother abraham says
[1:19:56] if jesus had to spend much time in
[1:19:58] prayer
[1:19:59] to stay in fellowship with the spirit
[1:20:01] that was in him
[1:20:03] how much more do you and i have to spend
[1:20:05] in prayer
[1:20:06] much time in prayer
[1:20:08] so if you only knew what time in prayer
[1:20:11] meant i didn't i didn't count that up
[1:20:13] but how much of the word is used here
[1:20:16] time
[1:20:18] time in prayer
[1:20:23] i want you to think of this here but
[1:20:25] iran would go on to that you know jesus
[1:20:27] spent a lot of time in prayer we see
[1:20:29] that
[1:20:33] it speaks about even how the disciples
[1:20:35] went away that night
[1:20:37] they went out on the boat
[1:20:39] and then we see how satan come right
[1:20:41] after him the devil brother rams as soon
[1:20:43] as the devil sees you out of fellowship
[1:20:45] with christ right then he'll set out for
[1:20:46] you as hard as he can just as soon as he
[1:20:49] sees you away from prayer away
[1:20:52] from consecration
[1:20:55] brethren tells us in this in this
[1:20:58] message
[1:20:59] further on down
[1:21:01] that jesus had went up alone to pray
[1:21:04] because there was a battle to be fought
[1:21:08] i think we can put ourselves here
[1:21:10] there's sometimes where we don't know
[1:21:11] battles that are coming on then there's
[1:21:14] other times where we know there's some
[1:21:16] showdowns coming
[1:21:19] is that right
[1:21:22] and the greatest thing that we can do is
[1:21:24] follow the example he knew there was a
[1:21:26] battle coming up across the sea
[1:21:29] he knew all of that and brother brad
[1:21:31] said he felt the pressure of that battle
[1:21:34] coming so he went up in the mountain to
[1:21:36] pray alone
[1:21:42] this
[1:21:43] is our example
[1:21:46] because we feel the battle we feel the
[1:21:49] pressures
[1:21:51] we feel pressure coming
[1:21:53] we feel things as it comes
[1:21:56] our way and there's things sometimes
[1:21:58] that we have to face we have to say or
[1:22:00] we have to do
[1:22:03] and we know there's a battle
[1:22:05] coming
[1:22:08] but i'd rather be prepared for that
[1:22:10] battle
[1:22:12] i would rather be so under the control
[1:22:15] of the holy spirit i'm talking about my
[1:22:17] emotions i'm talking about everything
[1:22:19] all of it to be so surrendered to him
[1:22:24] i want you to think of this here in the
[1:22:26] scripture
[1:22:28] paul would write of this
[1:22:30] in uh
[1:22:31] in ephesians 5 and i just want to
[1:22:34] read two verses of scripture here
[1:22:36] there's more than we could read but
[1:22:38] notice paul says in verse 15
[1:22:40] see that you walk circumspectly that
[1:22:42] means with wisdom not as fools but as
[1:22:44] wise redeeming the time
[1:22:48] because the days are evil
[1:22:50] now notice this word redeeming the time
[1:22:55] we know we know what redemption is
[1:22:58] redemption is to bring back
[1:23:00] to someone what rightfully belongs to
[1:23:03] them
[1:23:06] it's
[1:23:08] redeemed by a payment a price to recover
[1:23:11] from the power of another to ransom
[1:23:15] to buy off
[1:23:16] now look at the second part of this this
[1:23:19] of this meaning of redeeming
[1:23:21] it's to buy up
[1:23:24] to buy up for oneself for one's use
[1:23:28] i know
[1:23:30] some things may have lost their meaning
[1:23:33] but in order to buy something
[1:23:36] it requires money
[1:23:38] there's a purchase that has to be made
[1:23:41] you don't just walk into mcdonald's
[1:23:44] and say i want a hamburger
[1:23:46] they'll say sure they'll punch it in and
[1:23:48] then you know whatever it is inflation
[1:23:51] it's 10.99 i just want a cheeseburger no
[1:23:53] it's 109.
[1:23:56] you have to purchase it
[1:24:01] this is what paul is writing of
[1:24:03] redeeming the time
[1:24:05] buy it up for oneself
[1:24:08] but it's my time
[1:24:13] that's right that's why it must be
[1:24:15] redeemed
[1:24:18] just like in our lives
[1:24:21] we have been redeemed by the blood of
[1:24:23] the lamb we didn't become sons and
[1:24:25] daughters of god we didn't become sheep
[1:24:27] of god we always were he paid the price
[1:24:32] that was required to bring us back under
[1:24:35] his authority and possession
[1:24:39] so now paul puts this redemption of time
[1:24:43] into our hands and lets us know you've
[1:24:45] got the power amen you've got the
[1:24:47] authority to buy up for oneself
[1:24:51] to make wise and sacred use of every
[1:24:54] opportunity
[1:24:56] for doing good so that zeal and
[1:24:58] well-doing are as it were the purchase
[1:25:01] money by which we take
[1:25:04] we make the time our own
[1:25:08] amplified bible says it like this i'm
[1:25:11] going very slow purposely here
[1:25:14] making the very most of the time
[1:25:18] buying up
[1:25:19] each opportunity because the days are
[1:25:22] evil
[1:25:23] let's say it like this when looks
[1:25:25] redeeming the time
[1:25:26] it's as though that every allotment of
[1:25:29] time has a sold sign on it
[1:25:34] our time in our life
[1:25:36] i don't get time i don't have time i
[1:25:37] don't got time sorry i don't got time
[1:25:39] don't get tired i don't got time
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:43] it's as though every lot is sold
[1:25:48] so it's not based on us buying up what's
[1:25:52] available
[1:25:53] we've got to redeem some things that's
[1:25:56] been taken
[1:25:57] amen there's a sold sign there but that
[1:26:00] lot belongs to me
[1:26:03] but we have to buy it back how do we buy
[1:26:06] it back through sacrifice
[1:26:08] some things have to be laid down
[1:26:15] because to redeem is to secure back from
[1:26:18] the power of another
[1:26:20] that's why david would say teach us to
[1:26:21] number our days listen brother brahman
[1:26:23] says it like this in his wonders to
[1:26:24] perform
[1:26:26] he's talking about singing
[1:26:28] and getting into the word of god he says
[1:26:30] you know you go to singing hymns and you
[1:26:32] start reading the bible and that
[1:26:33] stranger the same one from luke 24 will
[1:26:36] appear to you
[1:26:38] as you meditate on his word
[1:26:40] it was while those who went to emmaus
[1:26:42] along the road begin to talk about him
[1:26:44] that he stepped out from the bushes and
[1:26:46] walked with them through the day
[1:26:48] the reason we don't have the spiritual
[1:26:50] blessings we have too much time to watch
[1:26:53] television a lot of other things we
[1:26:54] could put in there too much time to read
[1:26:56] the newspapers or listen to something
[1:26:58] that we ought not to be listening to and
[1:27:01] we are not redeeming the time but we're
[1:27:04] giving it you catch what he says here
[1:27:07] we're giving it
[1:27:09] satan isn't taking it we're giving it
[1:27:14] to the things of the world instead of
[1:27:16] our time to the lord jesus the things of
[1:27:18] the world is a very broad term you're
[1:27:20] not talking about going on drinking a
[1:27:22] fifth of whiskey it's simply letting
[1:27:25] down on the things of god
[1:27:29] and the bible said man shall not live by
[1:27:31] bread alone but by every word that
[1:27:33] proceed from the mouth of god christians
[1:27:35] live on the word
[1:27:38] i've given you many quotes at different
[1:27:40] times from charles spurgeon i really
[1:27:41] enjoy charles spurgeon
[1:27:43] very very tremendous man of god he says
[1:27:46] if you have not the time you guys know
[1:27:48] who charles spurgeon is right
[1:27:50] i mean he's a real charles spurgeon was
[1:27:53] a real man of prayer it always struck me
[1:27:55] from years
[1:27:56] he says i mean way back i don't know
[1:27:58] when was it back in the 14 1500
[1:28:00] somewhere around in there way back in
[1:28:02] the early times if you have not the time
[1:28:06] god gave it to you
[1:28:07] you must have misspent it
[1:28:12] that's powerful statement in it
[1:28:15] just like to see the value of what we
[1:28:18] have in our
[1:28:19] our disposal god gave us time
[1:28:22] god gave us an allotment job said he set
[1:28:24] the boundaries where we can't cross
[1:28:26] god even has given us allotment within
[1:28:28] the day
[1:28:30] he's given us moments in the day
[1:28:32] and god doesn't tell us how to spend it
[1:28:35] that's right you know me
[1:28:37] let me say it like this there my mom
[1:28:39] remembers this
[1:28:41] uh when
[1:28:42] my papa brown he was
[1:28:44] a mine foreman
[1:28:47] and they lived in a
[1:28:48] in a a coal camp
[1:28:51] so guess what
[1:28:52] when you worked now this didn't happen
[1:28:54] all the time but it happened in early
[1:28:55] times the coal mines paid you in script
[1:29:00] so guess what that script was useless
[1:29:03] outside of going to their coal mine
[1:29:05] owned store
[1:29:07] you know what i'm talking about brother
[1:29:08] dave you didn't go oh who has the best
[1:29:11] deal no no you work for them they give
[1:29:13] you script
[1:29:15] and then you got to go to their store
[1:29:19] you see
[1:29:20] it's things that when we we're looking
[1:29:22] at it that when we see it that's not how
[1:29:24] it is
[1:29:25] with god god has given us time but god
[1:29:29] is saying he's not sent there you know
[1:29:31] he puts everything out no no no you got
[1:29:33] to spend it right here but he allows
[1:29:34] he's put into our
[1:29:36] church
[1:29:38] you you handle it just like he puts
[1:29:40] places the money through the jobs we're
[1:29:42] the ones who's responsible for it what
[1:29:44] we do with it right now
[1:29:47] is that right
[1:29:52] goes into another place here in the
[1:29:54] message gonna have just a few more
[1:29:55] moments
[1:29:58] he says
[1:30:01] he's admonishing the people he says quit
[1:30:03] reading the old funny stories and
[1:30:05] looking at old no-good television
[1:30:07] programs and get back to church and to
[1:30:10] pray
[1:30:11] listen what he says here he said a woman
[1:30:13] says well i just can't find time
[1:30:16] to read my bible to my children
[1:30:19] brother brahman says why susannah wesley
[1:30:21] had 17 children
[1:30:23] and bless her heart
[1:30:25] and she spent three hours a day with no
[1:30:28] modern convenience
[1:30:30] now listen brother brahm's not wording
[1:30:32] this to condemn sisters
[1:30:36] you see many times what satan wants to
[1:30:38] put is put something out there to make
[1:30:40] us believe it's just like as i said i
[1:30:42] think the holy spirit took us two weeks
[1:30:44] ago on things that sometimes our
[1:30:46] schedules can get interrupted and satan
[1:30:49] would like to make us believe oh your
[1:30:51] schedule's interrupted well if i can't
[1:30:53] be right there in the bedroom i'll make
[1:30:55] this car
[1:30:57] my closet
[1:30:58] i'll pray right here
[1:31:01] are you hearing me
[1:31:02] it's recognizing i'm not going to be
[1:31:04] defeated because there's nothing going
[1:31:06] to stand between me and my god if daniel
[1:31:09] could live a victorious life in babylon
[1:31:11] without the holy ghost how much more has
[1:31:14] the son and daughter of god that we can
[1:31:16] live right in the midst of mystery
[1:31:19] babylon a victorious life right in the
[1:31:22] midst of satan's eden amen
[1:31:24] hallelujah conditions and our
[1:31:26] surroundings does not determine whether
[1:31:29] i have victory or not we have a place in
[1:31:32] god that we can come to
[1:31:37] brim says she didn't press a button wash
[1:31:39] her dishes she didn't turn on a tap and
[1:31:41] get a little water out like that she
[1:31:43] packed it from the spring and raised 17
[1:31:45] children and could spend three hours a
[1:31:47] day in prayer
[1:31:49] i know sometimes i don't have anything
[1:31:51] down in front of me but i know sometimes
[1:31:54] you know when we look at this and we
[1:31:55] read about it he didn't say that suzanna
[1:31:58] wesley was on her knees
[1:32:02] now there might be somewhere in the
[1:32:04] writing that says she was on her knees
[1:32:05] for three but remember
[1:32:07] prayer is not the position of our body
[1:32:12] you talking about 17 children
[1:32:17] i mean
[1:32:21] she had to find time to pray
[1:32:24] and with the needs of 17 children
[1:32:27] come on friends it's like having a whole
[1:32:29] great preschool high school
[1:32:32] right there 17 years old
[1:32:35] but she found three hours a day at least
[1:32:38] to pray she was in contact
[1:32:40] i just want to believe it like this she
[1:32:42] was in contact with god she might have
[1:32:44] got up a little bit before them and said
[1:32:47] god give me this day my daily bread she
[1:32:50] was in contact and when she was making
[1:32:52] the egg she was still in contact she was
[1:32:56] available to almighty god she didn't
[1:32:59] turn it on and off she realized he is
[1:33:02] right here with me
[1:33:06] amen you ought to take that and put that
[1:33:08] right in the devil's nose
[1:33:11] he's been in your craw all day you ought
[1:33:13] to put it right back in his nose
[1:33:17] what did she raise up out of that notice
[1:33:19] the effect of this what did she raise up
[1:33:20] out of this a john
[1:33:22] and a charles
[1:33:24] men that shook the world in their days
[1:33:27] brother said that's what we need more of
[1:33:29] today is mothers and people consecrated
[1:33:31] put god first he said we put everything
[1:33:34] else first and belong to society down
[1:33:36] there i belong to society too it's up
[1:33:38] there society belong these are but the
[1:33:40] society to belong to is a society of
[1:33:42] jesus christ poor degraded outcast
[1:33:45] people i'm so glad that i can say i'm
[1:33:47] one of them so glad to belong to that
[1:33:49] society now notice this word
[1:33:52] separate yourself come out from the
[1:33:54] world and don't be partakers with them
[1:33:57] abraham separated himself and god
[1:33:59] blessed him how many know that's true
[1:34:03] and give every promise that he give him
[1:34:06] he confirmed them to him when he
[1:34:08] separated himself
[1:34:11] i'm going to give you another quote
[1:34:13] before of charles spurgeon here real
[1:34:14] quick
[1:34:16] look at charles spurgeon he makes this
[1:34:17] statement he says it's not a matter of
[1:34:19] time
[1:34:21] so much as a matter of heart
[1:34:24] if you have the heart to pray
[1:34:26] you'll find the time
[1:34:30] you might have to find the time in other
[1:34:32] unconvenient scenarios but you will find
[1:34:35] it
[1:34:37] you'll find the time to pray because
[1:34:39] your heart is in it
[1:34:41] yes
[1:34:42] you see think of it in terms of
[1:34:44] investment
[1:34:48] i have a figure here in front of me
[1:34:51] of one day
[1:34:54] equals eighty six thousand four hundred
[1:34:56] seconds
[1:34:58] a little big conversion huh zachary
[1:35:03] one day this is how many seconds
[1:35:07] now you realize that if we could put
[1:35:09] this in dollar signs here
[1:35:13] eighty six thousand and four hundred
[1:35:15] dollars
[1:35:16] and that could be given to you daily
[1:35:19] and don't anybody start shouting now
[1:35:21] i've got it here in the slide i don't i
[1:35:22] think i had it there
[1:35:24] at eighty six thousand
[1:35:26] four hundred seconds
[1:35:28] and now you are given that amount daily
[1:35:33] man
[1:35:34] i'm retiring pretty soon man he's gonna
[1:35:36] put this away
[1:35:38] but the catch is
[1:35:42] you lose it whatever you don't spend
[1:35:46] and tomorrow starts another eighty six
[1:35:48] thousand four hundred dollars
[1:35:51] now some of you thinking
[1:35:52] target here i come
[1:35:58] exactly what i'm spending on buffalo
[1:36:00] print here this here i know exactly but
[1:36:03] i'll say i got no way man i want your
[1:36:04] mind out there i want you to bring it
[1:36:05] back back in here now
[1:36:08] you see we are given 86 400 seconds
[1:36:11] every day
[1:36:13] we don't accumulate it what we don't
[1:36:16] use right
[1:36:19] like that of the money it goes back
[1:36:21] and we have a new set each day it
[1:36:23] matters
[1:36:24] than what we do
[1:36:25] each day
[1:36:27] with what god has given us
[1:36:29] and we evaluate our life you say brother
[1:36:31] samuel that sound that that's tension
[1:36:34] brother braham said when we become a
[1:36:35] christian you add tension to your life
[1:36:39] and the tension is the blessing is am i
[1:36:42] pleasing to my lord
[1:36:44] now think about that e every investment
[1:36:47] there's an investment in our time
[1:36:51] paul said it like this in first
[1:36:52] corinthians 6 12 all things are lawful
[1:36:55] unto me
[1:36:56] but all things are not expedient
[1:36:59] all things are lawful for me but i will
[1:37:01] not be brought under the power
[1:37:03] of any
[1:37:05] in first corinthians 10 23 paul said all
[1:37:07] things are lawful for me but all things
[1:37:10] are not expedient
[1:37:12] all things are lawful for me but all
[1:37:14] things
[1:37:16] edify not
[1:37:20] that's where it comes down in our lives
[1:37:23] that god help me to evaluate
[1:37:26] what things are edifying
[1:37:29] spiritually
[1:37:30] building up
[1:37:32] friends we realize god has spoke to us
[1:37:33] very clearly we're not you're not we're
[1:37:35] not going to get away from the natural
[1:37:37] cares of life
[1:37:39] there's things that we have to attend to
[1:37:40] even the things that we don't want to
[1:37:42] attend to
[1:37:44] tax season coming up and everything we
[1:37:46] don't want to attend to some of these
[1:37:47] things like oh there's you know medical
[1:37:49] bills or insurance bills or we got to
[1:37:51] pay we got to get on and pay the bills
[1:37:53] for this month
[1:37:54] i don't think anybody in their right
[1:37:56] mind enjoys doing that
[1:37:59] or says yippee i'm gonna have some time
[1:38:02] taking up with that not one person
[1:38:04] enjoys that i don't think
[1:38:07] but we recognize there's things that we
[1:38:09] have to attend to in this life but then
[1:38:11] there's other things that god god
[1:38:14] doesn't do it for us but he entrusted to
[1:38:17] you and i to evaluate in our own life
[1:38:19] what's expedient to our lives
[1:38:22] what edifies in our life
[1:38:26] and think about that with time
[1:38:28] time well spent all right i'm just going
[1:38:31] to end right here
[1:38:34] jesus said in this scripture we opened
[1:38:37] give us
[1:38:39] this day
[1:38:41] our daily bread this is time
[1:38:46] time
[1:38:47] time
[1:38:48] time
[1:38:50] there's time we can't get back think how
[1:38:51] brother brahms sat there
[1:38:54] when he spoke to us in the adoption
[1:38:56] messages right before that he preached
[1:38:59] rejected king the first time
[1:39:01] and he spoke about his visitation beyond
[1:39:03] the curtain of time and here he was
[1:39:05] laying in bed remember before he's
[1:39:07] translated from this body into that
[1:39:09] theophany here he's laying in the bed
[1:39:11] and what does he say he says here i am
[1:39:13] about 50 years old what have i done for
[1:39:15] you lord
[1:39:17] i don't know about you but when i think
[1:39:18] of that i think my goodness
[1:39:21] what do i have to say
[1:39:25] brother ramon trying to be humble
[1:39:27] he was being real
[1:39:30] with the time that i have here i am
[1:39:31] almost 50 years old what have i done for
[1:39:33] you lord
[1:39:35] because there was a desire in his life i
[1:39:37] want to do more you see what was it it
[1:39:40] wasn't this is not the genealogy of
[1:39:42] random this is a genealogy of a son of
[1:39:45] god this is what pulsates in our life as
[1:39:48] sons and daughters of god this is what
[1:39:50] rivets in our hearts is lord what can i
[1:39:53] do for you lord
[1:39:58] time
[1:39:59] brother brown thought about that with
[1:40:01] time
[1:40:02] now just to leave here with this i have
[1:40:04] these slides but i'm not going to ask
[1:40:06] them to put them up i'm just going to
[1:40:07] refer to this this place here
[1:40:09] you know
[1:40:11] when we read this quote here
[1:40:14] and i didn't have any plans on this but
[1:40:15] it just struck me here
[1:40:18] yesterday evening just pouring over
[1:40:19] these things
[1:40:20] we sometimes look at things
[1:40:23] and and we can look and say well
[1:40:24] television programs i'm exempt from that
[1:40:27] i'm exempt from this okay but we
[1:40:29] recognize there's things that could come
[1:40:31] into our life and take our time
[1:40:36] things that could come in so subtly and
[1:40:39] that can take our time away
[1:40:41] from what's the most important thing
[1:40:44] and one of the things that i was just so
[1:40:47] impressed upon that came
[1:40:49] was one thing that we can all say that
[1:40:52] has come about
[1:40:53] it's almost in every home
[1:40:55] and that's these phones
[1:40:59] the amount of time the average i hope
[1:41:01] we're not average
[1:41:02] i hope we're below all right
[1:41:04] but the average time
[1:41:06] 144 minutes that a person spends on
[1:41:09] social media
[1:41:11] but say i don't have social media
[1:41:13] average time of americans
[1:41:16] on their device
[1:41:17] is five hours a day
[1:41:23] i i grant it if you probably if you
[1:41:25] looked at mine and it came to
[1:41:27] probably maybe yours too this is how i
[1:41:30] listen to the message from right from
[1:41:31] here so i can catch it keep going with
[1:41:33] it when i'm in the store wherever i'm at
[1:41:35] that's where i listen to it
[1:41:37] but you also realize you can evaluate
[1:41:39] everything else that's going on
[1:41:42] you say brother samuel you know i just
[1:41:43] go back to one of those you know i'll go
[1:41:45] back to the original phone you know
[1:41:47] campbell soup can you know
[1:41:49] string to somebody else's soup can
[1:41:51] that'd be nice wouldn't it
[1:41:54] well no i know phones themselves that's
[1:41:56] not the only thing
[1:41:58] but it's one of the things so slightly
[1:42:00] so subtly how things can come in and
[1:42:03] it's not even phone when you look at
[1:42:04] even internet usage
[1:42:07] and friends listen let's just be real
[1:42:09] sometimes it just goes from one click to
[1:42:10] another click to another click to
[1:42:12] another click to another click to
[1:42:13] another client oh brother samuel i'm
[1:42:14] studying but brother bannon tells us and
[1:42:17] it's clear you can do too much singing
[1:42:19] too much studying but you can never do
[1:42:22] too much praying
[1:42:26] see we have to think about moses what he
[1:42:28] did and we come back to that quote there
[1:42:30] can be too much of things that are good
[1:42:32] things but you can never spend too much
[1:42:34] time in prayer
[1:42:36] the things that god is making not just
[1:42:39] and all of this here it works to try to
[1:42:41] take away of our time
[1:42:44] it's incredible
[1:42:45] when you look at some of the statistics
[1:42:47] with different things
[1:42:48] that if a 10 year old starts out there's
[1:42:51] the over the amount that would possibly
[1:42:55] be used within a lifetime
[1:42:58] would be the total of six years and
[1:43:00] eight months has been dedicated
[1:43:04] to phone the social media and the
[1:43:06] internet
[1:43:07] i say this right here because i know i'm
[1:43:09] speaking to those who have children
[1:43:10] parents those who will have children and
[1:43:12] parents i say right now we must be
[1:43:14] vigilant
[1:43:15] all of us to be vigilant in our lives
[1:43:19] if all of us no matter children or not
[1:43:22] but very vigilant with these things it
[1:43:23] can come ever so quickly
[1:43:26] and i can say this right here look
[1:43:28] this is not even believers these some of
[1:43:31] these statistics this is not even from
[1:43:33] believers
[1:43:35] but say a person this is from people out
[1:43:38] in even a psychology realm with looking
[1:43:40] at mental and mental issues that are
[1:43:42] going on and saying a person should
[1:43:44] spend no more than 30 minutes on social
[1:43:46] media
[1:43:48] are you hearing me
[1:43:50] at but sammy you shouldn't say no i have
[1:43:52] we have to be plain brother brown called
[1:43:54] we love lucy
[1:43:56] susie
[1:43:58] you see all of those things he brought
[1:43:59] it down but to do what to discern the
[1:44:01] things that's going on but time
[1:44:04] well spent it's time in prayer
[1:44:09] it's time in prayer
[1:44:11] and if there's anything in the way
[1:44:15] then get it cleared out
[1:44:17] if there's anything that causes you not
[1:44:19] to have confidence to come before him in
[1:44:21] prayer don't let that stand between you
[1:44:23] and god
[1:44:24] repent
[1:44:26] get that cleared out
[1:44:28] so the channel is open so you can come
[1:44:30] before god in prayer and ask god to give
[1:44:33] to you what you have need of
[1:44:35] it's time well spent time in prayer is
[1:44:38] time well spent and satan is vigilant to
[1:44:42] take our time
[1:44:44] to fill our time
[1:44:46] and that's why we have to be vigilant
[1:44:48] with these things it don't just happen
[1:44:50] it's not we know it's not just a turn of
[1:44:52] the switch it's not even when we look at
[1:44:54] a service like this tonight it's not
[1:44:56] even something that we just hear tonight
[1:44:58] and say that's exactly right but it
[1:45:00] brings us to examination
[1:45:02] we have to examine our own lives
[1:45:05] where is my life at where is this at and
[1:45:08] really examine our lives
[1:45:14] you see
[1:45:16] jesus spent much time in prayer
[1:45:19] i say the bride of jesus christ
[1:45:21] we're called to spend much time in
[1:45:23] prayer
[1:45:24] it's not it's not something of a duty
[1:45:26] don't look at it it's not to be a duty
[1:45:30] it's a fellowship
[1:45:33] it's an opportunity
[1:45:35] brother branham made this statement like
[1:45:36] this and the prophet elisha he said you
[1:45:39] say well brother branham brother brown
[1:45:41] says you'll find yourself he says you
[1:45:43] you begin to let down on your prayer
[1:45:44] life
[1:45:45] and you wonder what's happening to
[1:45:46] spiritual blessings he said and you
[1:45:48] think
[1:45:50] brother branham but i'm a christian i
[1:45:52] really don't need to pray that much he
[1:45:53] said that's a sign if you're a christian
[1:45:55] you need to pray more than anything
[1:46:00] because we need
[1:46:02] his leading
[1:46:04] there's needs when god is speaking to
[1:46:06] our hearts and services there are needs
[1:46:08] that stand out very personal in our
[1:46:10] lives and as we pray
[1:46:13] we're seeking for god
[1:46:16] are you with me friends
[1:46:17] sometimes there's things there's a
[1:46:18] wrestling and it's a dying and it's just
[1:46:21] looking to god's god i i need this lord
[1:46:24] in my life direction questions we have
[1:46:27] and we need his his leadership
[1:46:30] don't you love him tonight
[1:46:33] i say god may we make a real
[1:46:36] if i'd say in this way consecration a
[1:46:39] reconsecration of our lives
[1:46:42] i mean time
[1:46:44] well spent
[1:46:46] heavenly father
[1:46:50] lord jesus
[1:46:54] lord when we could stand and we could
[1:46:56] lord evaluate
[1:46:58] and of our own accord lord
[1:47:01] we need help lord
[1:47:04] because lord sometimes we don't always
[1:47:06] see things the way that you see them
[1:47:08] lord
[1:47:10] you said in your word that
[1:47:12] lord your ways they're not our ways
[1:47:14] but they're higher
[1:47:17] lord i pray father here tonight
[1:47:21] that god that you would take us lord as
[1:47:23] your children
[1:47:25] lord your people that
[1:47:27] god day in and day out lord
[1:47:30] sacrificing lord of their life
[1:47:34] laying side time lord no doubt even as
[1:47:36] they've gathered here
[1:47:38] they're tired and weary from the tasks
[1:47:40] and toils of the day
[1:47:42] mothers with their children and
[1:47:44] daddies that's been lord laboring
[1:47:46] through the day
[1:47:49] lord god
[1:47:51] others lord that have passed through
[1:47:54] some of those seasons of time but
[1:47:56] yet lord god
[1:47:58] it's still sacrifice
[1:48:03] but father
[1:48:06] i believe that god that as we
[1:48:09] we come to the house of god
[1:48:12] it's time well spent
[1:48:14] but we don't want
[1:48:16] not as a hearer
[1:48:17] but to be a doer of the word lord
[1:48:21] father i pray
[1:48:24] god that
[1:48:26] may you just lord help us every one of
[1:48:29] us lord
[1:48:31] to so
[1:48:33] lord evaluate
[1:48:36] that i'm sure lord there's some things
[1:48:38] that can be trimmed out
[1:48:42] things that's infringed
[1:48:46] upon our time with you lord
[1:48:49] now lord it it comes to us to redeem
[1:48:53] redeem that time
[1:48:54] redeem it
[1:48:57] it doesn't fall to anybody else it falls
[1:48:59] to us will we redeem that time
[1:49:02] we can't go back and redo it
[1:49:04] but we can buy back take back what
[1:49:07] rightfully belongs to us
[1:49:09] we can evaluate down through things oh
[1:49:12] god
[1:49:14] and lord with a seal and a desire to do
[1:49:18] that which is pleasing to you
[1:49:20] god i pray right now this evening
[1:49:24] you're here father
[1:49:26] your presence lord
[1:49:28] this lord that you've placed lord upon
[1:49:31] my heart
[1:49:32] and lord you're here
[1:49:34] to minister lord to your children
[1:49:37] you've not come lord
[1:49:39] to bring condemnation
[1:49:42] the word comes and brings conviction but
[1:49:44] not condemnation
[1:49:47] and lord we can look into our lives and
[1:49:50] our hearts
[1:49:52] lord
[1:49:53] we are witnesses
[1:49:56] of time well spent in prayer
[1:50:00] sometimes lord through the course of
[1:50:02] life
[1:50:04] sometimes lord things
[1:50:06] little by little by little begin to
[1:50:08] encroach
[1:50:11] may we lord god
[1:50:13] look upon
[1:50:15] look over
[1:50:17] the landscape of our life
[1:50:19] knowing that god we only are we're here
[1:50:22] just for a moment of time
[1:50:27] and lord i'm sure there's some things
[1:50:28] that if we'll just ask that lord that
[1:50:31] you would direct us and say you need to
[1:50:33] buy back up that
[1:50:35] you need to buy that
[1:50:37] you need to bring this back
[1:50:40] from the power of another
[1:50:43] oh god
[1:50:45] you're standing right there lord with us
[1:50:47] lord father from our hearts lord a
[1:50:49] sacrifice oh god a desire lord to lay it
[1:50:53] down there'll be a contesting of that
[1:50:55] lord
[1:50:56] but i pray heavenly father may we see
[1:50:58] god of that value of the time and the
[1:51:01] hour in o god of the things that lord
[1:51:04] jesus that lord you desire to do in our
[1:51:08] lives oh god
[1:51:11] and as we look upon this field it's
[1:51:14] white with harvest
[1:51:16] we pray to the lord of harvest
[1:51:19] we seek lord
[1:51:21] for those things lord that would be
[1:51:22] beneficial beneficiary to the kingdom of
[1:51:26] god
[1:51:28] lord we've got decisions to make
[1:51:30] right here lord when we pray there's not
[1:51:32] only petitions lord but there's
[1:51:34] decisions that lay before us there's
[1:51:36] decisions upon hearts lord should i go
[1:51:38] this way or should i go that way all of
[1:51:40] these things order before us in prayer
[1:51:42] lord as well as even in our own lives
[1:51:45] lord coming to you
[1:51:46] and lord looking in the mirror of the
[1:51:48] word and saying oh god change me lord
[1:51:51] give me strength lord in this area of my
[1:51:53] life
[1:51:55] lord
[1:51:57] i pray father
[1:52:02] may from this moment lord
[1:52:05] it just be such a resonating lord that
[1:52:08] an evaluating
[1:52:09] and a redeeming of time
[1:52:13] that god that they we would recognize as
[1:52:15] sons and daughters of god that time
[1:52:17] belongs to us
[1:52:20] it belongs to us
[1:52:23] but redemption
[1:52:25] requires
[1:52:26] sacrifice
[1:52:30] granted lord we pray
