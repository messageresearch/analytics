god bless you this morning just a few announcements here just remember the prayer meeting the Lord willing this coming Tuesday also just remember brother George and prayers he's gonna be traveling back flies out of Detroit tonight five thankfully everything worked out for morning just seeing how the weather was going so some of you that's traveled up there on that I had her state 94 that's I don't need to sing no more if you've ever been on the interstate 94 in Michigan it just something else so we just want to just remember brother George and prayer certainly was a real blessing just a real real encouragement to our hearts we just thank God you know I know it's a little different on the nights that we had the meetings but you know sometimes I think we get too comfortable where things have to be convenient because I'm you let your thought we'll both of em tells us this right here brother Graham says you take for example a family that'll drive through a snowstorm I'm not advising that I'm gonna have that's church in a snowstorm but brother Graham just making a point here he says you take for example a family that'll do that he said you watch god bless him for their sacrifice there's when it sacrifices made by the remm talked about in the message desperations he talked about how all those were lined up down in Arkansas and he talked about how each one of them were getting their needs met and he said you know why it was is because there was a sacrifice he said for anyone he said that's born with a silver spoon he's the expression silver spoon in their mouth they don't appreciate it very much I say Lord don't ever let us failed to appreciate his goodness and the opportunity just leave just what we what is given to us here this something's here a little bit too loud the also would I want to ask you we could just for the sake of things that Sunday and Thursday morning so let's just go right to the word I'm gonna read a portion of the word then I'm gonna let you be seated second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 we'll read down a few verses of Scripture y'all aren't tired are you Lord had to service this week I mean we can plug it into 3rd certainly 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 do we begin again to commend ourselves or neatly as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you now Paul speaking of many of you baubles readers you would know that you know this in the book of Acts even when someone was sent out from you'll find Paul doing of this where they would send out maybe an evangelist or whomever and they would write letters of commendation regarding this individual and so this individual then would be received because of the character that has been expressed in regards to say receive this man it'd be good for you received him he'll be a blessing to you so Paul is letting to be known that you know we we were not in need he was just so loud up here before i don't know what it was it's better now thank you paul was expressing that that God has so evidently confirmed that and vindicated that that there's not a need for another epistle of commendation God's already vindicated himself so in verse 2 ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables heart and such trust we have through Christ to godly not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if administration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of a spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more the administration of righteousness exceed in glory even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that xcellent where if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth may God bless you to being seated we want to continue look at that thought with the heart of God Paul is here in the opening part of the chapter Paul's placing the same parallel you remember when God had brought Israel out into thee in the wilderness and here God was bringing them out of Egypt with the objective not to bring them into the wilderness but the objective was to bring him into the land so we understand that in the midst of the deliverance from Egypt and coming into the land which is which is the fulfillment of the promise that in the meantime riding through here there was there was a weeding out there were there was a remove and a dissolved and God allowed all of that time we we understand that Israel made a choice during that time and then God allowed them to wonder around and around for 40 years until as the Bible would say that generation that was there was was consumed and so there was gonna raise up God's desire where there was gonna be people who were going to move fully into the promise they're not going to be just glad that they got out of Egypt and there in the wilderness because the wilderness is not the that's not the achievement the wilderness is a process but the achievement is full reconciliation and that's the that's the whole part of the gospel of every time that the word is ministered through every age and in every part is there is a promise that is given and when that promise is given God comes on the scene to manifest that promise and the manifestation of that promise is to stir the hearts of the people in faith in God who made the promise that he will fulfill that promise sometimes you know it's very easy to get caught up in the things aware of what God has done and you can recognize what God has done but for it and remembering why God came down and he visited them within Egypt and all the signs and all the wonders the Bible says I believe it Psalm 78 that where David speaks by inspiration he said that of all those things that were done he said that the people didn't understand it it wasn't that they didn't see it but they didn't understand what it was all about that right there was manifest that they would have a confidence in the Living God they would know that not only not not just knowing a letter but they would know the Living God and their confidence would be in God that God Himself will fulfill this word it isn't that you and I haven't figured out we don't have it figured out but that's where we have a rest because we know that God Himself makes known his word to us by by his great sovereignty and then through all of that through the Junction's and the moments and all these things it's God himself in sovereignty preparing us making himself known to us it's him taking care of his word and that's why it's so important that we be identified with his word because we're identified with his word God always keeps his word and so we find this this parallel that Paul is speaking of of how that when when Moses they come out here in the wilderness and Moses receives and you know the commandments of the Lord here he is up in the presence of God and God instructs him there in the vision that the promises that's been received are the commandments that these these Commandments are to be put into that of an ark and there would be that'll be the Ark of testimony it would be called the tabernacle of testimony because you see God never intended that the commandments themselves would just be you know just stones and just in other words just to have that kind of a meaning that it's not a real meaning but God wanted it to be a testimony that it would be a witness and that's the same thing God desires in every one of our life is that our lives is not just something of stone where all of a sudden we've become impressed upon or engraved upon but there's a real living pulsation in our lives and it's a it's a real living testimony because a testimony is nothing that somebody can teach us if testimony is nothing that a mom dad prophet nobody can give us that it has to be God himself come on the scene and it must be us to where we can say Lord I believe not about I can't explain it but Lord I believe but it's recognizing him that's what's important friends it's not that we understand everything it's recognizing him because if we can recognize him and yield to him then he can't give to us the understanding that we need when we need it and that's the confidence that we have in him and as we see that within it Moses here he placed that test only within within the arc and that arc it was in a it was in a place that nobody had access to that place but the high priest once a year it was a place that God had told Moses that right across this mercy speed see I will speak to you I will commune with you live to hear it was a place that it would be where the word itself would find rest it was a place where Communion and fellowship would be it was a place of atonement it was a place of reconciliation in that same time as Paul was saying here that the word itself is intended to be placed and find its rest in the heart of the belief that is God's desire when God as he revealed himself to Paul the objective the desire as Paul could say ye are our epistle written in our hearts because Paul he himself as he said in our hearts Paul and those that ministry that had come under that light there were ministering in continuity and unity of the promise of the faith of the Living God and that going forward it was not the image of Paul that was getting placed in people's hearts or or any of the other men Timothy and Philemon allof it was not their image but it was the image of Jesus Christ as a matter of fact Paul you know was in such a place to where he said I was in fear and trembling lest your faith would be placed in the enticing words of man's wisdom you know what Paul knew that he'd pulled knew his strengths while knew a lot of languages pulling through a lot of words but Paul also realized that if I come in that manner and I rest upon that people's faith will be in words like that and that won't do no good but their faith has got to be in the power of Almighty God and nothing wrong with words but there's got to be the power of God come behind it and back it up because after we leave this service when we go out of here you may not remember every single word been Martha's clock we're after and after God help me see the help me to see in my life what is the most important thing is that the power of God the presence of God has come down through that word vindicated that word confirmed that word and then we give ourselves to that word and as will to give ourselves to that word we are changed we are transformed and that word that was spoken now becomes reflected in our life it's an igniting to bring forward what is already linguist in you you understand the preaching of the word is not imparting something to you but it is calling forth out of you as a seed of God what is already there hallelujah it's amazed you and have recognizing more and more of who we are so this is God's desire that the word would find a resting place in our life and I tell you we could go through here and testimony and witness when the spare in the Word of God finds his place down into the depths of the heart of the believer in their change their transform and tell you what a life to become a new creation the life itself becomes like that where the house of obed-edom were the ark itself came there and was placed in his house and all of his house was blessed because the ark was there when the word is pressing in our life depressions of the Living God is there our lives oh my you might be going through all sorts of things this morning but if the word has found its mark in your life its resting there in your soul there might be all sorts of things your mind and your spirit you might be traveled here and there but there's a rest down deep in yourself you've got a greater one on the inside better move as we say Lord move upon this troubled waters Lord move upon my life Lord God we have that confidence in him Amen this is a living dog in a living word in the message leadership I want to read this this is a little bit of a limp T quote but I want to read it here because things within it I want us to to catch but the randoms in prayer and he says dear God as we stand here tonight a dying people our faces are turned towards the earth it does you give us this cutting sermon Lord we see the example of two men one of them was a religious man went to church but rejected the leadership to eternal life and the other rejected the worldly fame and turned to eternal life if we just stuff right here when we look at it who when we can see just where they're standing who is closer not the one in worldly fame the one who's living a religious life is closer but because he turns down the leadership you see it wasn't necessary that he ruin was we could say well he just flat-out rejected it or not he did because he rejected leadership leadership is very very important leadership always shows itself always shows this but here is fine he says there's one that rejected worldly fame and turn to eternal life and we see both of their conditions tonight according to the Bible the rich man is in torment and Moses is in glory father we want to be like Moses we want to be led by your holy Son Jesus Christ to eternal life give it to our hearts tonight Lord tear out the old stony heart place into the new heart the heart of flesh the heart that you can talk to and deal with and we will not be haughty or different so you see even even to come to eternal life you know process can be bypassed it has to come through where God God deals with the heart turning that lard so that the heart itself is actually now as the scripture you know says in the Book of Ezekiel multiple places a new heart and a new spirit will I give you this is not something we give ourselves but even God gives us a new heart and a new spirit because as the Prophet is very clear and saying we couldn't get along with our self or our neighbor so if you can't get along with your neighbors you had even got a new heart in the new spirit yet just flat-out save it you know we will not you understand - where where we ask friends where we're not here how much you understand that we're not here to be sugar-coated we want to hear the gospel we want to hear the letter that is here to transform us we're not planning on staying here this is not our home this is not the achievement of this our the achievement of the hour is the rapture the change of the body there's many things that we are longing for and promised even as the president was saying the message Messiah whoa God before all of this comes to an end I trust that you get a hold of a bunch of people Lord by your spirit and they living underneath that word and your presence that they will be clear your word your life in every dimension that is supposed to begin I know I'm gonna say like this I don't believe that that's something in the future I believe that there's people right now I believe I'm one of them but I want you understand this right here hang on I'm not looking at that promise and say well we've arrived know various a greater a greater there is more and more and more of God for our lives the moment we stop asking for more is the moment that says some time ago our hearts already have excellent we need more of him heart of flesh this is what we want a heart of flesh and without me dealing with this a lot there's times where our hearts and hearts need to be dealt with sometimes our hearts can drift on things our hearts can get caught up in complexes and other things I'm not gonna feel this act this morning but then a heart of flesh is one that he can speak to and God's got confidence that he can speak to that heart and lead it in the way that he needs to go may the Holy Spirit never leave Lord may it coming ordain this people speak to them tear up their stony will and put in the will of God save everyone father give us a bad love once you watch this get us to a place Lord that won't get away from all the emotional part to the real solid part of the Phenom the heartfelt part the deepness of the Spirit the riches of God the kingdom of the Spirit in our hearts granite oh great leader great Holy Spirit before you take your flight into the skies with your church just hold it to ever let is a sense that we'll get away from the emotional part now you know for the bread is not calling we don't need in there's no more emotions that's not what he's saying there's some of the statements of things where it's closed it's closed things to be it's gone off into such a place to where they have stale Christians where is the baptism of the holy ghost or that no sensation and those things are quoted without a life to back it up God is not created just statues it's living images it is a reality if we place that work correctly that it is not something and experience with God is not something that's worked up but it is divinely orchestrated by God and the real reality of it is the fruit that follows afterwards because sometimes where the enemy wants to so hammer people on is they want to say I know the date the time to our the disc that this and this and then there's others say well you know I don't know that the day of the our brother Samuel that's not possible 1964 sister bruised brother Brandon I don't have anything I can put my foot on but I've ever had an experience are you with me now and there's multiple places in the message and that but I could even pull out to you of different ones we're going right through but you know what it is where did the Prophet blame them back to he let him see better foot he's not resting upon an experience it rest upon the world it's not to be an experience in the word and experiencing what did he said your life normally and naturally would have been this way he said but what changed your life see she had the question but she already had the answer he had the director and she said what's Christ that changed my life I tell you what you know when you read about of that and I've heard you know I've talked to her brother Jim Humes even when I you know I was ministering in his church and he I referred to that place and and brother Tim got up and told it the church later he said you know that particular interview was not a meeting we're not an interview that was requested by sister Bruce it was an interview brother Brandon requested because sister Bruce was going around to sister Humes and different one saying I wish I had what you had and I wish I had what you have and I wish I had what you had and brother ran our clock window then he called for that interview hello you know what that her feet would be able to be established so she's not gonna be trouble on that what they want was Satan doing what was he doing brother brain went right into it power maker for us and how that this is how you are you get somebody on your heart you can't get them off your heart till you go and pray for it till you do this he said and now Satan takes that on the contrary my goodness so I we must be the ones who's left in the dark on how we're made up God knows how we're made up and Satan watches us as well but thanks be to God if we've been born again from our soul greater is He that's within us Amen we've received a bear I don't overcrowd and be able to show the victory through that life you love him this morning you're talking about of deepness a heart to a part where our lives it's a pulsating where it's a life that's to live in expression it's not just something of that other of a church life but he is the entirety of that life it's a deepness of spirit not just an anointing that that comes you know you know how many times you know you can see things you can see things you know it well this is a praise break and you know they're all not chatting and everything else but friends listen I'm not making fun of that but when it comes down to it look what kind of mockery the things that's become to where lives that are liveth but it's such a mockery among the world where the world says me go to church why I know different than you and yet now listen I believe one thing we're gonna need we need to watch very carefully and not call everything that falls the Holy Ghost knows their demon anointing that comes as well oh yes Sarah when the Bible talks about doctrines of devils friends that is not the Holy Ghost bringing that bringing that doctrine that's a doctrine of devils there's a lot of things in there and I want to say it I want to say it like this it's very very important it is a must it isn't Sesa t that our lives be ready and not just ready to go but you're not you're not even ready to go unless you're ready to live now you know we're you know a religion something that's just once in a while something that's just an afterthought it's just a church life Church life's not gonna cut it a church like I'm telling you right now don't allow Satan to sell you short that's not what Calvary was about a church like the Calvary was about a shedding of his blood that his life might come back upon the worshiper and liberate you and I and bring a heartfelt deepness of Spirit to where whether you're in the house of God whether you're in the marketplace or you're in your house you're a Christian you have different at home than you do at church I'll tell you right now you're a hypocrite and you need to get rocked if you have different to somebody's face than you do on Facebook you're a hypocrite your heart's not right with God when the Lord Jesus came down in Matthew 23 these guys were all styled out real good but Jesus weren't looking at the outside he said I want to see your heart and your heart is food and contaminated whoo princesses it's checking up you see what it is it's looking at the balance of the world and you can have a weight and the weight of the word and there must have a life that matches that weight there's no life you know what I mean you can have a ball that has all the dimensions of a bowling ball when the ball should get out of the supermarket but you just look at those balls there's a different density it might look the same but there's a different density that's why God when God would set the density of his people even that of the apocrypha of the anointing oil it was not left up to outside means but he said and he referred to it your measurements shall be based on the tap on the sage of the shackle of the sea truth the show God provides for measurement of his word were men shaved down what the true reality is and then we have things that's not balancing up with the word but God himself provides to every generation the shell and it's the shell of the sanctuary that's minister oh my a deepness of the Spirit Bill Graham said it like this he says Oh God let me go Lord don't leave me behind Jesus let me go with your father I don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on I don't want to stay here in this insanity I don't want to stand when hideous sites and people losing their mind we look at man trying to act like beasts and look like beasts true and the women trying to look like animals with the paints on their face knowing that these things are predicted to happen that the thing will they'll go too insane to love us will rather with hair like women to hop the women what is that yes demon spirits and how does it be prepared Hollywood is preparing by all the imagery right now all the traps and everything that's let me ask you where do they get the inspiration for those images tell me where they get them from they've never seen a ghoul in heaven come on somebody where those images come from oh it just made up somebody's my nonsense come on we're smarter than that it's demons and spirits it's things that is projected even to where that the Prophet would would speak in howl did certain demons they they look in certain manner some black you know crawling like a splatter another thing this is a reality when it speaks in Revelations nine of these great creatures that are released not going to be the lid taken off of that yes sir every one of those demon spirits those things have been released it's preparing the people for tribulation in order for destruction to count the people must get in the spirit of destruction shall be far the rapture to top the people have got to come into the spirit of the ratchet Laura Peter God no ma in this hour I tell you what there is nothing more precious than the leadership of the Holy Ghost nothing more precious than the word of Almighty God they men here in this time and in this hour to see all of these conditions and things taking place he said teeth like limes and things that you've said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone you say we see it right in the making right now in invisible union you're aware that he speaks right in the midst of that message and he says Oh God insanity marching right down the church boots insanity help us restore us to the same mind of Christ Jesus our Lord all great leader of eternal life we accept your promise tonight father actually for this people I believe for every one of them in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I pray that Christ the Son of God will come into the hearts of everyone of us Lord and mold us and make us into new creatures in Jesus Christ brannad Lord God when allows you to look at this we want our dispositions are changed to come into us that we can be your children feel of your spirit moving in our hearts Lord tinkering us and bringing us to the realization of this insane age that were in tendering us tendering us bringing us to that realization granite god when we see young men so young women so caught in the web of the devil young men perverted minds children dope addicts cigarette smoking drinking him moral Satan's Eden now if they with me now God had taken you six thousand years according to the Bible to build an evening and you put your son and his wife and there his bride to rule over and Satan come around and perverted it he's got six thousand years and he's built his own intellectual eating through science and education and so-called intelligence and he's building into a mess of death let me tell you what be or what thee what the motivating factor is behind that it is Babylon Mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic Church and the me just go ahead and put it in there and the Prophet said the preston's Protestants want to somehow classify themselves different he said they do the same thing because they are harlots of that horse system they do the same thing you know sometimes you hear things like that on the radio you hear things up oh boy the Roman Catholic Church and things like this and that in the Pope and you think hold on they're on our side don't you think that we're we tell you something it's not about our side as a man there is a clear side that you and I or to stand on and that is the side of the word the side of the Lord Jesus Christ not the side of the church the side of the Lord Jesus Christ we be called to stand on his side he won't make nobody stand by his side but he asked y'all that's on the Lord's come stand by me [Applause] he's building into a message look at this friends that don't stay at churches even for people who don't doc in the church doors and they're forgetting when I was still teaching it was a whole you know what some of you know some of the teachers did they took a field trip to a church walked him to a church downtown some doesn't wanna know why almost 30 kids in a class one raised their hand that they had ever been inside to church you understand there's worse things but sometimes you take some that are religiously educated but what I'm getting at is that you see such a place of mockery to where look what look what Satan's diabolic system has done it has not produced a real fervency a heart that beats forgot as a matter of fact it's produced opposition it's taken out from among the people I'm not talking about coming into a church of the lost feel this way I feel this way or whatever more sometimes you can just feel that way you walk in front of a monument you understand lord have mercy when I had to deliver flowers then big Catholic churches I had to walk in the door and all these Easter lilies I have to unload all that panel van lord have mercy I'll go I'm looking around to me with like a spook place I'm not saying that to put things down friends I'm just saying that within it within the midst of all of these things that our presence it's the presence of God that comes down to deal with hearts and life and when his presence comes down we don't want to just upon our flesh with a only just about our Spirit we want it to fall into the depths of my heart just upon our flesh it runs out you know how the prophet called that camp-meeting claims closed upon the spirit it's the same manner it's not the manna that's the problem it's where it falls if it's just on the flesh it runs out if it just on the spirit it runs out but if it falls into the soul it's taken there into the soul and the presence of God it's there to keep from time may now become the creature of eternity and there is a feeding that takes place they are fed by the divine energy their life is changed and now the heart pulsates the Living God he's built it into a mess look at the wreck look at the wreck with and things within where it comes down into families and everything else all of this and yet all of this is put out there the Prophet speaks of that in invisible union of how that everything now has become an imagery trying to look for something else and you've got Hollywood teaching people how to be families dear God have mercy that's been going on and look what it's produced mess because it's not real it's not true it's not genuine you say what are you saying but they're not telling you God is a God of every area of your life there's no God doesn't want to be God he wants to be found in every earring my name got started but I'm just going to refer over these things in the next part of the scripture here that we move into Paul goes on to say here and I have to read these to you he says seeing that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech our preaching it's not with soul figures of this mysterious and this that's not what the ministering of the words about trying to make things mysterious for people to wear when they come out of it oh that guy is so deep in what in what friends I don't know about you but I'm the depth I want is the depth of his life inside I don't it doesn't doesn't matter if if a person says well I think you're deeper I think you're shallow run more it's not up I don't measure myself by that I want to speak want the unction of the Spirit of God lays on my heart to speak doesn't matter sometimes he can change things that I don't even what I've studied out under his own show but then he can change it at a moment's notice and I don't even have one single note and yet he'll stand right there and deliver it I don't have one single note but it's what he he it's about him it's not about me it's about him most of that revelation is in what is in our hearts is now in your lives it's a transmission look at this in verse 13 not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished that veil over his face they were not able to look and see the end of the law to see the fulfillment what was it that kept them from that the Veil the veil now watch how Paul moves into this in verse 14 but their minds were blinded from till this day the same veil I'm taken away in the reading of the Old Testament it remains which veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart so the veil that set Moses was wearing was a type of the veil that would be on their heart and the veil upon their heart that weren't blinded here is the very word that means dull callous lacking understanding it means to grow hard or become dull in an amazing better tree that is drawing water from the ground that tree he can draw that water my pushing out but you let that tree fall over in the water save water same tree what's happened the position of it the same water that once nourished it is now the water that rottens it come on somebody its position you must maintain your position that's why the Prophet uses that phrase in what I just referred to you at the tree keep life in you never let the spirit of revival die there's more to be said on that but let's move today blanket the veil is upon their heart but look what Paul look what Paul says nevertheless when it the heart the heart shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away so the veil itself is there but it's that where their heart is not turned 40 if the heart is looking at the word um their eyes are looking at the word but the heart is not behind places I refer to you in the scripture here now think of us Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of it but within the midst of Israel there's an election and Paul deals with this he speaks of how that Israel was following after the law of righteousness I want you to catch this here they were following after the law of righteousness but they did not attain to the law of righteousness how do you follow after something and not attain to it it's exactly what he said in Romans 9 wherefore Romans 9 32 wherefore how can this be because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law the heart wasn't in it it was not by faith it will simply by works doing enough to get by now remember remember these are people you couldn't put a finger on their life these are people when you compare them to the Lord Jesus remember they had more fruits of the spirit but they it was not the fruit of the Spirit that's why the problem be careful when you're reading this the Prophet says Christians science can have more talking about you starting with these these attributes these characteristics but the fruit of the Spirit is the fruit that is ordained to be made manifest in this season and when that truth is made manifest it has within it all of the characteristics of a life from the vine come through the branch and now make fruit see it's not something we're producing it's Christ we are in him than his life flows through us and what is it what's manifest through the branch the life of the vine the Bible goes on to say here in the book of Romans in 9 they are not all Israel which are of Israel see there's an election that was hidden within Paul says it's not because if they are all seated Abraham that they are all children remember as we've been the Spirit of God been taking us on that they had become so haughty with what they had been raised up under because so haughty and then different the Paul makes it clear it's not because they're the sea but in Isaac in the promise those are the promise of faith seed oh my Paul goes on to speak of missing Romans 11 I know I'm moving through this quick but I had this down for you he goes on to talk about how that in verse 5 of Romans 11 even so at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace Paul is very mighty Paul puts you and I into a place to be mindful that Israel never thought this could happen to him and Paul puts us when he's talking about the grafting of the the wild olive branch and Paul said you better be careful what the pride doesn't get in and become lifted up as though God can't make it without me you gotta be careful friends remember it is the grace of God I don't want to get ahead of myself but man I'm telling you I want to get somewhere Israel the Bible said in verse 7 Israel has not an 11-7 Israel have not obtained with that which he seeketh for these people were not as I've been saying like this lazy they were seeking for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded they were seeking for it asked him if the Messiah is going to come absolutely we're expecting it Oh God but God could never forgot about Israel just as much as Sheila work hidden and wrote there in the scriptures he's not forgotten about Israel as a matter of fact for the Rebbe said they're there they're waiting on us to get out of the way let's say God help me get out of the way then we get out of the way so I can get out of the way the lady God's never forgot he's brought them back it was not the harsh hand it was the tender end of Jehovah tender mercies tender what the world despises it there was no Holocaust there what no this you know what what make what it is they try to deny those things are trying to sweep over let me tell you something it's the same diabolic spirit you what is it it's the rolling revival the Prophet said in in time seat side he said when they give back that part of Germany he said it will be now the old Roman Empire and he said what will it be the Roman revival because that Landers come back there is a branch revival because we have received our receive the borders of our land the land the promise that's been given back to us as believers we're Satan Wonderwall enough with traditions fill it up where the whole Eagles been down there that's that river Euphrates battle there for all those thousands of years but now the Holy Ghost is loose wrap back into the Church of the Living God once again what is it it's Christ reclaiming my children my life will be so lived that it will literally draw the rest out of the group what's he doing declaring his boundaries what is this this is that stone the Prophet tells us from Jubilee year he said there must be a ministry on the earth to catch that stole the ministry of the stove when the stone is coming down I say that ministry has already called to catch the coming stone he'll elude Jesus said to to the disciples he talked about how the people's hearts had waxed gross say me callous all insensitive but he says bless blessed are your ears for they hear and here's what he says for verily I say into you in Matthew 13 17 many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see I have not seen let me say this to you Paul has desired to see this I've preached about it he was declaring it what was hidden in this tree back there Paul those things begin to come out they've preached on the change of the body they preach these things what a privilege it is with this privilege comes a high responsibility to remember that it is grace that taught my heart his grace my fears His grace that brought me safe thus father His grace was safely kidding the Bible says in Zechariah 712 it speaks from how that they made their hearts they made their hearts adamant stone lest they should hear the law so there was a difference they were hearing it but they weren't hearing they were reading it but they weren't getting it lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of Hosts hath said they made their heart so hot where is our here and where is your see if your heart the presence of God that's how we see is with a heart not with these eyes these eyes can read these ears can hear but this on the inside they can hear it can see what these eyes can't see these eyes can see hallelujah Leslie should hear the law and the words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets the hosts of the Lord were there on the mountain that day I'm not just talking about any last this time I'm talking about the hosts of the Lord were there the hosts of the Lord I'm talking about all the representation come on friends when Jacobs shows back up he comes across that River the Bible says he begins to see a whole host of angel and Jacob Cosette mania the head by the camp that of the two camps were to test heaven actually Ken Magnum Ljubljana whoa so who accompanied these prophets it was not just gotta cut them it was a lot of Hope standing behind his water his train filled the temple his presence comes with his word to confirm this word oku repeat of God if we are inside of that word dwelling inside of that word you say better send you do you got my back as somebody else bigger than brother Samuel and the Browns are there at the gates the gates is where transactions happen they want to approach the gates but there's a seagull that sends there the Holy Spirit says got more work this room is sealed they did this they did that did but the Bloods been apply the Lord of Hosts has sent in his spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts they never got in the spirit of the author they were reading but they never got in the spirit of the author sometimes you ever read something you have to go back and read there's one book that I read from cover to cover in school right at the end of my master's program I read I'm very always a little bit here you got saying that I always went through it and you know they teach you first a little bit of college you're going through and you're just skin picking through you're able to go through the pages moving through getting getting topics and something to eat all those things but this one my statistics I love them I understood it made sense to me there was things it was workable in it but other stuff you know it is when you've read it sometimes anyone or read in the scriptures you reading you think you reckon reading you listen to a message give it back give it back then what I do just committed to God that's the truth don't try to pry into it commit it to God God will bring I'm not just saying things things they're things up to you off the cuff I'm telling you right now that's exactly how God operates you bring those things to you actually have need of it but they didn't get in the spirit up but you see the prophets the prophets themselves were moved by the Spirit of God Peter declares that and we see that they were moved lifted up out of the earthly senses and they would speak things that it's not even reasonable to the human mind a virgin shall conceive it's not reasonable but you see what happened they were vessels instruments that were set aside they didn't make themselves holy they submitted to the voice that called them by submitting to that learner he brought separation to where the word could have preeminence and they as a prophet just let me refer to it in spiritual food and due season he said these prophets so lived in the world in the presence of the Lord till they be king that word I'm telling you brother and sister that is not just a privilege for the prophecy that was a time it was pointing to the perfect son the second Adam that was to come and his life was a declaration because no none of us were there but his life those of declaration of this is how I intended you to be this is how the first Adam was and this is my idea of sons and daughters wasn't a church idea it was God's thought they become so wrapped in the presence of God they were lifted lifted out of these senses the Bible says it he goes in you know enjoy a further place you see how that they would cry look out David David so yielded to the Spirit of God remember they were asking who's he talking of is this pavement talking about himself or the who is it was a spirit of Christ indeed for us it you see their lives were were touched by God knows by God and they were moved in that place to where there was a pulsation in their life to where that God was announcing his coming a further unfolding was taking place in their life let me say this the word just did not come to them and make an abrupt stop the word is living the word is not the water came in and continued to unfold and unfold and unfold going up like a roman candle poof over there it's unfolding itself he took the seals off himself it's him unfolding himself in your life he's the theme of it he's the thief he was the theme in the Old Testament he was a theme of error the Bible talks about him Peter of how but this salvation this salvation be receiving the end of your faith even the salvation or soul the Bible says that this salvation the prophets inquired and searched diligently they spoke these things what the Bible said the Spirit of Christ was in them it signified of his suffering he spoke of these things the Bible was on the st. Onge alas they'd administer these things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven what is it the same Holy Ghost that picked up the prophets and then begin to announce his the same Holy Ghost that came on the day of Pentecost and picked up those apostles picked up them each and every one of them and begin the minister that were it's the same Holy Ghost that goes with that word that lifts you and I in the kernel that word what is it it's God Himself to God be the glory it's the fullness of him that filleth all in all it's Christ these prophets these men they knew it was coming they knew it was coming look how wide you could stand on Mount Carmel he was not trying to reclaim the church he was there under the unction of the holding edge what was that not Karma visitation about it was about the looking forward to the salvation that was to come getting him back in line for the promise because the promise is gonna be fulfilled being at the right place at the right time at the right moment that right Israel noted the lamb was put up that in Egypt for 14 days Israel know it was coming there right they know that was coming the Prophet said Luther was looking for this video Wesley knew who's gonna come look what he said he says it in the message the token he said lay knew that the pillar fire was gonna visit the church again and make it all look back in the world and know that God never does anything breaking a pattern of his word are you with me at the end there of the time but that age when here was a summing up of the time to where the Redeemer would come balcony Israel how could lose her how could Wesley how could those true Pentecostals know that this would come in this hour how could they know that the pillar fire was going to return because in this hour the unction of the Spirit of God that was picking them up and revealing to them their part in the body whether it was the toes the feet the legs the pies whatever it was they knew they were a part of that body and they were thing with an unction because why here must come a bride in completeness because he made a promise he will present unto himself a church without spot wrinkle blemish or any such thing he must come again in his fullness that's redemption what is redemption claiming the body that he had brought forth he brought forth this body wearing good he brought it forth out of the womb and he steps forward by his word and he claims the body that he had got for the Bible said on who now see the staff descend and remain apart this was redemption hallelujah there was a man by the name of Simeon well we've been looking at Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of it but there was a man by the name of Simeon the Bible said he was a devout man and he had a testimony see the first thing that you've got to ask you question yourself do you have a testimony so he had a testimony before all of this coming and picking up the Messiah did not give him a testimony he already had a testimony that prepared him for that moment is that right he was a man the Bible the Bible says you know he that he was lady for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him it was waiting and resting upon his life there was a Simeon there was an Anna that was waiting for the consolation brother Samuel you just read that all the Israel was seeking for it and they didn't obtain it that's exactly right the natural Israel that was looking for it they did not obtain it but there was a remnant who was waiting line with the pulsation of the heart of God and they were lady constantly waiting for the fulfillment of the world their faith was not that they could explain it faith was his that God has said they had that same God who made the promise his the same God the Bible says the Holy Ghost was upon him let me tell you something the Holy Ghost so far rather pulled a lot and let you know Holy Ghost was upon him now once you catch this here it was revealed to him in him in Luke 226 it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost revealed that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ I don't care what kind of sickness tried to come his way he could stand there and say you can't touch me not in arrogance but he that was showing that there is a pride in the last days this type of lead here was Simeon that there's a bride pairs of people that one God has revealed his word though Satan may try to sell you this man said it that way but he cannot get to that soul we've been sealed by the Holy Spirit and that sea of alert seal is a security [Applause] [Music] [Applause] verse 27 and he came by the spirit into the temple how did he come by the spirit into the temple it does so here look look what what was revealed to him did not bring some sort of a hazard light well it's time to go to the temple again well it's time to it didn't bring that you think there weren't days that Simeon didn't get down they wouldn t now don't claim up on it I'm trying to I'm trying to show friends that the things are where that enemy wants to paint things so bad sometimes wants to paint it so bleak he wants to paint it well this is so bad but remember friends you're not a people without a covenant you're not a people without a promise that word whatever you have need up he's already got it covered he knew what it brought you along this way you meet me t he he tells me water breath he come back for you he yelled you need shoes on your feet I might kick down but don't you kill me I might go through text you might go through trial but don't you tell me how he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law which is here is Mary and Joseph bringing the child in after the custom of the law they're being brought to this place into this moment and Simeon being brought to this place it's why once you see here was Mary and Joseph they weren't doing things contrary to the word they were doing it according to the word see it wasn't malar free from the law no they were going they were operating according to the law and here's a man who was a devout man who living according to the law but what was the difference in them it was a pulsation in them it was not a formality it wasn't all print with no life if it meant fatherland they were waiting they were actively living in the prophecy of the word the Prophet said what the problem was with Israel they had gotten away from the supernatural part they began to read in the word and begin to come up with their own ideas about things the beginning they left off the supernatural part of God remembers we looked at that last week Jesus brought up that part where it says you transgress the commandment of the word by saying you know they went into that part then whosoever honors father and mother but rather just say it's a gift whereby thou must be prospered by me it showed they had no fear of God and no fear what was that he was removed from them they were reading his word but they didn't know him they had no fear so a man that could take away from the word they had no problem taking scissors to him they could cut out certain things come on somebody they had no fear because they had no heart they had no heart because they had no love come on somebody Jesus when he spoke to them what did he say in John eight I know that the love of God is not in your hearts they didn't have to it show that there even before the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that there was the potential and there was that where the love of God could dwell within a life what waiting for the fulfil it wasn't just words but they were moved by an inspiration they lived so close to that can I have just a little bit more time I want to just just bring you to this to this place here here when we look at I want you to think of this this statement then when you could look at their lives remember the Prophet said as I said moments ago you could not put a finger on the room but yet just because they could do this and this even to the paint I knew all of those but yet that is not a life live they're gone with the print begin accept the life live by the word that's their thinking of how it was but that was not elected by the word jesus said in the where he first heard of what moses spoke to them God led you and suffered you to hunger fed you with man that you might know that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so it's not just it falls out sustained it's done now there is a continuance in his word it's a walking long in his word so a life being lived by the latter is not the word expressed but the word expressed is when the heart of that word is that's a life expressed by the word this is what Jesus is dealing with this part here this is where the Prophet I love hi says there's some souls in prison now I want to read this to you he says not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by church joining not by fruit to this Christian science can smother any of you on that and deny even Jesus Christ was divine not that but it's the word living there is if they'd have only looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the Spirit of God in him or a woman lifts that word and lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are aware to the people the heartbeat when the latter times each place in your heart it's my heartbeat upon its pulsating out pull out for the bank cows eating through the branches the water comes why what is the work because there is a part that is already by coordination the Spirit of God moves upon our eyes you're talking about hard people in different people follow me back to the beginning to service there is a people who are a lot closer people who studied for a long time lot closer that pored over this Bible a long time here how he remember Jesus made a great supper these are telling to come they said you don't tell him we got other things to do so they sent him excuses I'm gonna tell your name no excuse it's gonna get you out the flames ahead very nice Cuse that'll get you out the Tribulation Period but there is a token and it's not just getting the token so you can escape it because if that's your reason you won't get it your motives are wrong because you wouldn't want to live why you would want to live right you wouldn't be faithful when you got there so the token itself that's why prophet says and many times he said that's why the token is not so readily given out why motives motives but people have behind the Morelle Simeon was lay your hands on me that I can receive this power that I can do things wrong move it well god I want to be a better man that's an admirable thing but it's more than being a better man to receive the Holy Ghost here's the fell in love with him fall in love with him not a chance [Applause] the person their table had become a snare psalm 69 verse 21 this is the million of the Missi annex songs let me just read this part because it on the cross they gave me also golf for me and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before now we know what a table is right I'm not talk about a coffee table Amy ain't talking about a sofa table we're talking about a table from the looks at us nobody has to tell us what to do that's right this is a table what's the table let their table and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap you mean the very word they were following after the law righteousness they were seeking for you mean that the table because they're setting it and the law was there but it wasn't just the law the table is their teacher their o their ideas their thoughts I want you to watch this listen look what their thoughts and ideas did did it humble or did it blow Allah that's why when somebody wants to come and give doctrine I want to see what it does for you you make sure that you're a true representation of the true doctrine of this life that's why when things are constructing to run more I want to say is that what it produces I don't want okay we got this quote here not this quote here got this scripture I see what it's producing it's a false image you've taken things that God has given and constructed a false image I don't want no one you can keep it and see what kind of life that it produces I don't want a mom this was a bad life is it not there people had become a snare Oh mom they're teaching what would their teaching doing their teaching was not building people up in the faith of the world they had the wall they had the prophets they had all these things their teaching wasn't building people up in faith it was tearing it down that's why the had to take away from the way well yeah it's not on or father and mother you just can't you're just a gift to them there's no power of God that can come behind they work Mac then no matter what the situation wasn't that young person's alive but if they could take that work and stand on their word and plead that promise it's not the man the flesh that comes and gets a hold of the promise it's Almighty God who comes on the scene and fulfills that promise let me tell you something church it is not us that's making the word come to pass it's the Spirit of God coming through the word building our faith in the world that is the Ministry of the seventh angel was to go on restore Bible Ted [Music] wouldn't need a new Bible we need faith restored back in the Bible that was given hello a great advantage poll said they had a great advantage it'd be like you know brother Doug you and I you know we were at a buffet that one Buffett we went to over there a place in one day let's say you were sitting at a table right close that Buffett remember you can just reach over get a plate and get the stuff and Here I am clearing that other room where they put us that day who's closer he is who really has an advantage he does he has an advantage because he can say they just brought out dressed my song oh they just brought off this fettuccine oh they just brought out fifty times all day I don't know what they're bringing out I've got to keep running back and forth running back and forth don't you see Paul said that they had the advantage he said chiefly in every way to them was the covenants to them pertain with the adoption all of these things there wasn't any promise that was so so brought out there so play declare of the Gentile but yet we see even when Simeon speaks about the light to lighten the Gentiles even placed in the word some small parts were mention about the Gentiles Hosea Habakkuk all the different places Isaiah it was mentioned in there this is why Paul could say when the Spirit of God would move in this time in this hour that the Jews themselves having the law they had an advantage but the Spirit of God could pick Paul up and he can show Paul the mystery that was kept hidden and Paul could come back and begin to declare that mystery that you and I were chosen in Christ before the foundation he could speak the give riches and the unsearchable riches of Almighty God and let you have no whose talent is dogs and outcasts but yet beneath it all gods and she'll get it all then what will seem to be a disadvantage God where we learn we were looking he came there shuttle traditions their traditions and so took them away you know it's like it's like you know a place to where they have so contrived these traditions to where they didn't even recognize him when he came like an internet scam artist send another picture of this big buck where you from I'm from Ohio but I have a British connection I would love to marry human seen all of the limousine understand he's showing the picture people falling over the picture and not seeing who is the character behind it I hope you with me now that goes now it's not just a picture it's the character John was ready to bow before the image with the Spirit of God said let me show you the character they looked at the Pharisee who said ma what an image Jesus said full of dead men's bones what was it he was a ministry that came to reveal character because what was going to be taken in the upper room was the Spirit of God to come down and not to lift up a fallen character but to reveal what was hidden there beneath the darkness true image Oh glory be to God you're loving this morning I want you to think of this the very promise of God what it did to Pharaoh and to his servant in hardness look what what is that his presence but there is a receptiveness he's tendering us he's molding us bringing us into the preparation when the Israel went into Babylon why did they go into Babylon heart condition what was going to get him out of Babylon heart transplant when you shall seek me with all your heart and so then I shall be found of you what condition put them in but turn to the heart brought a lot God you got in this world Psalms twenty seven eight David I want the one just kind of drift back just a moment here look how look what David is saying these are very important words David says in Psalms twenty seven eight when thou settest seek my face my heart when that said to me seek my face my opinion my presence my person seek it my heart my heart said my face Lord then I seek look how big if we read this last week in Psalms 19 I'm not going back to it but you know Bible reader you read things look how baby wrote there in the songs David did not ride he wasn't him David talking in a manner where was just a letter to him David Luke he knew God David would even have said let me read these in Psalms 119 33 teach me O Lord the way about statutes and I will keep it unto the end there is a God I'm not gonna try to figure it out I need you to teach me you teach me Lord give me understanding and I shall keep thy law yeah shall observe it with my whole heart make me to go in the path of that Commandments for there into I delight in crime I look what David is saying lord I need help in crime my heart there's times we need help we need doctor in trying our heart is that right incline my heart unto thy testimonies and not to covet us what's David recognizing Lord I need you I can read it but teach me how to live it help me Lord this is where Ezra could even say before Ezra was leaving Babylon the Bible says in ezra 7:10 what peculiar 1710 center ezra prepared his heart prepare my heart repair the scriptures in this table remember I'm coming to the table remember in the scriptures in the tabernacle there was the table of shewbread there right the shewbread the rabble called shewbread man or the rem-pod shewbread men are back here but this is the word of shewbread it's the bread of his face the bread of his presence the bread of his presence but every word that was see Aniyah shewbread men living by the word of his presence this is why that we need to ask God continually your reviews Lord God prepared me for what you're wanting to reveal prepare me Lord preparing maja so it's asking God to reveal and it's asking God prepare me the Lord prepare me we're here will you cover like Simeon we're coming into the house of God don't prepare me Lord prepare a meal order if they've got got maybe some type of fall it's a contrary containers prepare meal or prepare a meal or not just come into the house of God but every moment you have access to that prepared me Lord I'm on my way home from work Lord and father it's been a name of prepare me to prepare me Lord God what is it it's the word of his presence this is the table that we are called to eat from this table where it's not just worshiping an idea God it's done an idea an idea can be put up on the ship on Sunday at 3 o'clock don't worry I'm not gonna 3 it can be put on the shelf of 3 an idea can be picked off the shelf when it comes time for Thursday yeah yeah I need to be there Thursday we'll just catch it on archive it can be picked off the shelf later on it's an idea now it's Sunday it's not that boarding at a friend's it's your soul sure it's being prepared the rapture is for those that are prepared to go made ready to go those who are ready making ready you see where they had come to such a place here in Israel they had taken the word brother Joey was like an old violin they were ready to take that violin did seem to have the value in it the profit in this agent stands there and I'm dating of God Harvey just triplet early Monday morning he said they're selling it for pennies they're auctioning this word off like nobody's business you know what have because there's not faith in the Living God that he'll perform his work there's so much unbelief in this age but let me tell you something just as hands lid has been tore off and Hamel is here on there for you in the book of Zechariah the Lord of Hosts was with that word that was spoken by the Prophet who may tell you something the Lord of Hosts is still here with that word angel [Applause] [Music] backing up that word he's here in the cap to vindicate his word bring his word to life I don't know and while they're looking at a word and saying well I don't think we can do this or I don't think and do this here was a master that walked an old master he took that bottle in it took that they begin to tighten up the strings you see what it was he was out of tune it took the master to know how to tune it up he didn't have some electric Marino tuner Wireless B he himself was the set scale he had with him right there he knew what tune this needed to be set at he sets it Roscoe's up the bow however you do that he does that it takes that puts it in position and he begins to play Amazing Grace how sweet the sound what the Prophet said he said he won the dry eye sitting at that auction what was going to be sold for pennies became priceless imitated something that the Spirit of God has come to him he tore the seals off of this Bible he tuned me to do he tuned it up he didn't add to it or take away he took what was here and the great rose and stroke of predestination the Spirit of God poured out in this hour to make that word Leah what did he do he begin to bring them promises to life Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me a generation in that day that was so out of tune they were out of harmony they were trying to play off the music sheet but you can't play it when the notes have been changed heaven yokes have been altered that's called improvising is that right brother Ricardo let's call the improviser you know where people just improvise things on their own I like that kind of stuff on music that's me all right that's not doctor but look what they did change notes and they changed notes to where they had their own arrangement they got out their pipes and they were plankton and they said hey we packed unto you and you're not dancing we learned unto you and you're not lamenting really what's wrong we go play cuz I'm here fulfilling the song [Applause] great news that she wrote by the great composer he said well listen it was a lining up all things were synchronized and he could tell him and say my life is coming out according to the original music sheet to be a God listen be careful then that's to be careful as we talked about that advantage let us be careful brothers and sisters to take heed of the word that God has delivered to us the preaching of the word the hearing of the word the Lord passing right through and confirming his word he passed right through he passed right through the Pool of Bethesda there was one man from college he passed right through this age passing right through the churches pass right through but don't let him pass you back say Lord Jesus I don't want to form I don't believe any anybody I know I don't believe I don't believe anybody sets out and says I'm just gonna have a forum I don't believe anyone just sits out with that mindset I don't believe that the Prophet tells us those nuts who go into those was the call numbers he tells us that he said they don't go into be bad with they go in there they believe they're doing something I don't believe people go through things with forms I don't believe that I believe nobody says I'm just gonna be a form but I just want to just encourage you don't don't let Satan put anything over it you have that there's anything less than a full life don't don't don't let Satan put anything over on you then let he's still not the same God you might have here I've been serving the Lord for years in your life but you might see you feel like Lord I'm gonna be there's a closer walk I don't want to just I don't want to stand still you know the Prophet God's chosen place of worship in the middle of the prayer he said they're dying may the people who follow this message never stand still for a denomination the key word has not been on the nation the key word is keywords stand still don't stop when God has revealed its word its continuing to walk in the light as he is in the light my brother Brent gave that example that men said I could you know he said I come going with me over home Levin so I can't see your home he's no brother Romney said there's a pastor right here he said I got a lantern he said we can walk in this path and said it we're on the other side of that hill he said is my house for the better said to the brother he said brother that's the same way this before he said you just take the light of the word he said walk in the light and as you walk in it he'll reveal more walk in it walk means you move in it occupy it how do i oq PI by letting it occupy you that's how we occupy let the life Israel occupied the land by letting the life giver of the promise occupy there when they stop letting the life giver occupy them they lost the land they were staying so it's him occupying us Lord every part every every every aspect of me search me out and whatever the need whatever the promise does not promised us a spirit of improvising he promised us his spirit which brings us into harmony with his word but you know it's a great symphony things have tuned up things are brought into we're looking at the sheet music and from the sheet music and we're able to look at that at the director I've seen the Greek Holy Spirit moving bringing the Junction's so we know as we're going moving along by his grace his presence with his word don't I'll say from my heart and say from this church Lord I don't want my life to become just I wanted to be the pulsation of his principles that's why they even David when he instructed Solomon about building the temple he said son serving with a perfect heart and with a willing mind she went on to tell him David some the Bible says on his first song the Bible says that David spoke within that time and said seek the Lord and his strength seek his face shewbread Pinilla seek his face continually continually we need you it's his presence you know how it is sometimes you've been going through something in your life maybe you're a test to trial maybe you've been in the doctor's office I don't know but you understand what I mean there might be something maybe you're just down and all of a sudden here you are you start thinking about him and he gave you a little something to think on and you're gonna fake it on it as you start thinking on it all the sudden there's this press is just sweeps down don't mean the world do you you just find yourself here your hands might be you know covered in butter and you know you have a knife here between your heart and thinking Lord Jesus what is it its strength it's his pressing gets prescence by his word coming by his presence what is it his word that's why the property could say he says we get his word in our mind and in our hearts what happens his presence the Prophet told us what did he say many times in the beginner service such simple instructions but he would say now land a middle disservice he said I want you to get this promise on your heart and I want you to start thinking about that promise that I'm the Lord that he loves me I want you to see it in your heart right now that you're not gonna be on that cot or you're not going to be in that wheelchair he's not trying to make them mind over matter but it's trying to let him see let the word have the preeminence in your thoughts because the Prophet tells us that even in the days of the Lord Jesus and in his ministry he said when he would be standing there on the platform he said he would all of a sudden he would feel a pulsation and he said what it was there was a meet in the audience there was a need somebody had a need they had gone to thinking on that word and their faith was when what their faith was rising in the Living God to perform that word and what was it it was a pulsation through the bread said like a heartbeat thank God his attention how would he know lamb was act the heartbeat found the heart met the heartbeat found the heartbeat that promise was their deliverer she is beating he wants to be everything he wants to be our all in all he wants to feel every part of our life every SP goes he's all in all everything everything that we have needed friends he already had he already has four family he comes down in this this service like this it wasn't that you remember every single word his presence come behind his word to make his word known to you you might walk out of here and there might have been some that you got out of this service and you go talk to somebody else in somebody else they got something they got this part of it or what was it it's God speaking to his people his presence coming down that your faith is in him and he stirred that's because he he much he loves to make himself known seek the lord of history seek his face this heavenly father when we commit the word what God have you spoke to our hearts lord I pray that you would just confirm and Lord for every need you know the hearts of your children father I pray dear God right now that you'll grant every single request grant to him Lord faith in order to stand upon those promises I pray God as you come down by your presence this morning moving us Lord in these promises then father when we leave you we're not leaving your presence but we we leave out of here closer to what granted every request behind every hand in every part father this is our desire Lord it's my desire I believe it's everyone no one should have all of us all of us Lord every part every chamber every area Lord God as I've read enough study the heart itself has four chambers chambers within their Lord and how that those chambers have to work in such a harmony and synchronization with one another each one has its part Lloyd your god when we've read about this of where a heart can become blinded heart wax gross it's where Lord God a condition as I was reading it's called cardiomyopathy Lloyd to where there's a thickening to where that there's a part of that heart in that chamber that's not working correctly maybe it's a part board that is where it's putting forth the blood into the lungs to get the oxygen and bringing it back overlord it putting it out through the rest of the body maybe it's not working just properly your God I pray this morning father knowing that we are standing here near presence I don't believe there's a soul in the building Lord God we can't doubt that Lord we're standing in your presence Lord to know that the petitions what we have mean what we desire we can have it I pray father may you grant Lord the request of your children this morning in the name of Jesus Christ we ask you Lord amen ancient word [Music] changing you we have [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] brother Brown picks it up in modern events made clear about prophecy expressed as to how the Scriptures he said this is not just a look of history it's a book of prophecy so living and he goes into that and he says the believers those who are believing and looking for these promises waiting patiently on their toes waiting for them to be fulfilled is who it's revealed now you might look and you would look at those Pharisees and different ones we would say I think they're on their toes right you would say I think they're on their toes they're quoting it they're doing this we're doing it but there's a Peter there's an Andrew so we've got John the Baptist we've got Hannah we've got Simeon we hit them but then let's take a let's take the Peter let's take the Andrew let's take to Philip let's take the Daniel let's take all there let's take these different ones here they are they look like there's no way they're waiting for it there was a pulsation in their heart waiting for that moment this is why that even where that phil could go to Nathanael and say come come see I just can't even tell you about it come see what do you say we have found him Moses and the Lost Book of you what does he say the image that was there in that word we found it they were on their toes now move that move it forward now with a forward they were on their toes and then look what takes place after his resurrection he pierced to them he speaks to them on what their to do right and the Bible says when he was a sin me the scripture says at the end of loop recording it that they returned unto Jerusalem with joy why the ground goes onto that scripture says they returned with joy because they knew he was gonna make good on that promise see he had raised and revealed himself to them for what banku faced when he walked with him on the road to Emmaus he didn't come out and try to say look look look look look look look look look he began in Moses he took them through the scriptures concerning himself what was he doing building Bible faith you say what was going on what was going on in his ministry before the resurrection wasn't a Bible faith being built sure it was faith here's the living God among us now it had to be built their faith they had to take all of that and had become accumulated for them to move into the next feast to where now they have faith for the promise for their lives what do you find Peter waited on his toes he doesn't look like the Peter that they found out there fishing he's had been changed what's happened what he was waiting for is being unfolded in his life it's being afforded is waiting earnestly this is where think of this 1963 flashing red lights was coming and the Prophet gives the example of a train passing through what's rid of trains do and make the style like different ones of different ones of you us we fly you got a fly to a hook right you can't sometimes in flight straight shots and you have to get off of the hub and here you are at Atlanta I'm in Detroit I'm looking where's my gate why then when they stop there I should have time to go do something there's like a 50 minute window sometimes I want to have sometimes two hours sometimes for three hours sometimes what is that it's a time of a delay you have time that you can go get something this is where the Prophet said it's time to throw away it's time all the things that have been picked up at the Whistle Stop it's time to let it go it's time to get on board it's time to be in the Train now time to stop time to look around there's not time to take souvenirs it's time to be in the tree all the peanuts and everything else inside everything it's time to become supreme more look if the Prophet himself I don't think anybody or one of us would argue and say well brother Branham wasn't sincere there's not one if you would say this man wasn't sincere you need help but how the Spirit of God dealt with his life and said you need to be you know what he said help me be more sincere than that because I this is the sincerity but you're calling for for more sincerity help me helped me to come to that place so when our heart is longing Lord I want more than you I want to be closer to you he brings us into that place No no we've been here water and I don't intend to keep you hours studying [Music] these burns in my heart I believe the Spirit of God by his words I'm gonna save each and every one how many of you you know I think about so many times praying whether you come from clothes or whether you come from far away trade God richly bless you I know he does your sacrifice your desire what about a church it's about here I said god bless you your licks of fire what a blessing it is to come and finish these presents I'm lick the fire gathering together for being changed by the presence of god bless you I will see Jim what day it is in February the 20th some there but just remember me prayer if you would let's bow our heads precious Lord we are thankful Oh God for your presence Lord that we are a people that can't change Oh God for many years ago you started the change but God we want a continual change and to be molded and broken in the Potters hands and for Lord as we as we look at crowd cross and as we've even heard the testimonies these past couple days Lord that there's Lord there's a place we can come to and there's a reality of a world beyond this that is so real it's so much more real than what we're looking at and Oh help our vision to change Oh God that we can look beyond these eyes in these ears Lord we can see the world that's beyond this that you're calling us to in this the Saints that have stepped across they call Lord God press toward the mark and O Lord help us each one even this morning as we would go from this place as we go the next coming days that O God might that desire be in our heart just to live every moment with you and our thoughts Lord and just our just to know that you are pleased with all that we think about and all that we say and all that we do that you have the preeminence Lord that's our desire and we just ask this for your children as we would depart and your presence would go with us on the highways keep us safe Lord and we just look to the next time we can gather in Jesus name we pray [Music] me too come [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] at you [Music] was [Music]
