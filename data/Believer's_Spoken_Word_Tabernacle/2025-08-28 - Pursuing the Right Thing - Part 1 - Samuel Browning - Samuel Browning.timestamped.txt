[28:21] of the Lord. Let's sing that tonight.

[31:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's all stand tonight. Let's sing
[31:17] it once again. Oh, there is freedom in
[31:22] the presence.
[31:24] There's freedom in his presence.

[32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, I am healed. He is present.
[32:16] I am forgiven.
[32:18] [Applause]
[32:21] Thank you, Lord.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; I am not the same. I have been sh
[32:29] for
[32:32] his presence.
[32:33] [Music]
[32:36] I've been forgiven.
[32:40] Oh, I'm not
[32:44] the same.
[32:46] I've been changed
[32:49] forever
[32:51] in in his presence.
[32:56] Hallelujah.
[32:58] And let's just go to him in a word of
[33:00] prayer tonight.
[33:02] Heavenly Father,
[33:05] Lord Jesus, what a privilege it is to be
[33:08] able to come together,
[33:10] be able, Lord, to unite our hearts
[33:12] together, Father, in Christian love and
[33:16] be able to approach the throne of grace
[33:19] that we might find help in the time of
[33:22] trouble.
[33:23] Lord, we're standing as needy, needy
[33:27] vessels, Lord, as your children. Oh God,
[33:30] how thankful we are for what you have
[33:32] done and what you're doing in our lives.
[33:35] But Lord, we're standing once again
[33:37] tonight in need, Lord. Oh, Father, truly
[33:42] every day in our lives, Lord, how we
[33:44] need the mercy of God. How we need,
[33:47] Lord, your longsuffering and your
[33:49] forgiveness, Lord. But oh God, how that
[33:53] Father, when we look at that throne of
[33:56] grace to find help and need, Lord God,
[33:59] we know that Lord, we're depending on
[34:01] you, Father, to bring your word to pass
[34:04] in our lives, Lord. You're all that we
[34:07] have need of, Lord.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; So, Father, we ask tonight, Lord, that
[34:11] you would help us, Lord, once again.
[34:14] Dear God, give us grace, Lord, to not
[34:16] only to yield ourselves in this moment,
[34:18] but Father, the things, Lord, that you
[34:21] would speak to our hearts and and guide
[34:24] us and lead us into, Lord, that Father,
[34:27] even from this moment, there might be,
[34:29] Lord God, even a deeper yielding, Lord,
[34:32] into the things of God. We pray, Lord,
[34:36] you've not asked us, Lord, to fulfill
[34:38] the word. You've not even asked us to
[34:42] bear wool. You've asked us, Lord, to
[34:46] bear fruit. Not to manufacture wool or
[34:49] anything. But Lord God, just to yield.
[34:53] And Father, through that life within us,
[34:55] Lord God, the wool will come, the fruit
[34:59] will come, Lord, all of those things,
[35:01] Lord God, that you have packed within
[35:04] the seed, just like, Lord God, every
[35:06] leaf that would be on an apple tree,
[35:09] every apple that it would ever, Lord,
[35:11] bring forth, every branch, Lord, every
[35:13] part of it is within that little seed,
[35:17] Lord God, when it would go in the
[35:19] ground, but that quickening power begins
[35:22] to release what is in there, Lord. So we
[35:25] ask tonight, God, may you grace us with
[35:27] your presence once again, Lord God.
[35:30] Father, quicken hearts and lives, Lord.
[35:33] Move among us, Lord. Draw us closer to
[35:36] you, Lord. I pray to one another, Lord.
[35:39] Oh God, may you just heal those that are
[35:42] in need, Lord, in their bodies, Lord.
[35:44] Give them strength, Lord. Touch them,
[35:46] Lord. I pray. We ask Lord for brother
[35:48] Dave Crest that Lord you'll continue to
[35:50] minister strength Lord and and healing
[35:53] to him Lord. Oh God relieving Lord of
[35:56] the discomfort and the pain Lord and his
[35:59] body Lord. How we thank you for bringing
[36:00] him through that knee surgery Lord. And
[36:03] we just pray that God you'll continue to
[36:05] give our brother strength Lord and help
[36:08] him Lord. I pray as he's going through
[36:10] Lord just these moments Lord just to
[36:13] Lord use and become reaccustomed to
[36:15] using that knee Lord I pray God may you
[36:18] grace Lord our brother with your
[36:20] presence Lord be with him Lord right now
[36:23] I pray Lord for each and every other
[36:26] request there's many needs among us Lord
[36:29] oh God may you continue to give strength
[36:31] and touch each one Lord I pray in the
[36:34] name of Jesus Christ
[36:37] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[36:40] Amen. God bless you musicians. Thank
[36:42] you. Amen.
[36:45] Amen. So thankful for the grace of God,
[36:47] aren't you?
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that was about two of you.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; I said we're thankful for God's grace,
[36:53] aren't we?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:56] Amen. His grace will certainly see us
[36:58] all the way through. And that's what
[37:00] we're we're resting. Amen. In him. I
[37:04] want to just uh go right into the
[37:06] scriptures here tonight in 1 Corinthians
[37:08] 13 and to just look a little bit more
[37:12] here
[37:13] in the scriptures here tonight.
[37:18] 1 Corinthians 13
[37:21] and verse 8.
[37:24] And Paul would write, "Charity
[37:27] never faileth.
[37:30] But whether there be prophecies, they
[37:33] shall fail. Whether there be tongues,
[37:36] they shall cease. And whether there be
[37:40] knowledge and knowledge revelations, it
[37:43] shall vanish away. For we know in part,
[37:47] and we prophesy in part. But when that
[37:51] which is perfect is come, then that
[37:54] which is in part shall be done away
[37:57] with. Verse 11, when I was a child, I
[38:02] spake as a child. I understood as a
[38:05] child, I thought as a child, but when I
[38:08] became a man, this is one of the key key
[38:11] turning points. When I became a man, I
[38:15] put away childish things. For now we see
[38:20] through a glass darkly, but then face to
[38:23] face. Now I know in part, but then shall
[38:27] I know even as also I am known. And now
[38:31] abideth of faith, hope, charity, these
[38:35] three. But the greatest of these is
[38:40] charity.
[38:41] I just like to speak to you tonight on
[38:44] this thought on pursuing
[38:47] the right thing. May God bless you and
[38:50] bless the reading of his word.
[38:53] I think there's so many great and
[38:56] wonderful promises that God
[38:59] has given to us and we are certainly
[39:01] living in a time and an hour that we are
[39:04] not just pressing just for one promise.
[39:07] And yet the promise of the rapture is
[39:11] truly the goal. But within that promise
[39:14] of the rapture, there's so many other
[39:16] promises that God has also allotted to
[39:19] us because we know that the rapture
[39:21] itself is absolutely the catching away
[39:26] of of the bride of Jesus Christ. And it
[39:29] is that character that Christ himself
[39:32] has been able to so perfect within our
[39:36] lives. And we know that that perfecting
[39:38] of our character that is things that
[39:41] doesn't come from just setting and
[39:43] hearing the word. Yet we need to be
[39:45] encouraged. The word will direct us in
[39:48] areas that we need to yield to. But
[39:51] there's nothing that will perfect our
[39:53] character like tests and trials. But the
[39:57] word itself is what comes to encourage
[39:59] you and I through the test and trials of
[40:01] life and encourages us and helps us
[40:04] sometimes within our our perspectives
[40:07] can be kind of off and kind of skewed
[40:10] within things and that's all part that
[40:12] comes with that humanity at times and
[40:14] sometimes we are just sometimes can be
[40:17] beside ourselves. We don't know exactly
[40:19] what is taking place and and truly even
[40:22] like with our understanding that God has
[40:25] brought to us in this hour regarding
[40:27] tests and trials that they are are
[40:30] allotted to us as a measure of suffering
[40:33] that is given to the church that Christ
[40:35] left behind. And yet with understanding
[40:38] that even when things are not going just
[40:40] right or maybe going our way or tests or
[40:42] trials come along, it's no sign of God's
[40:45] disapproval. And yet within all of that
[40:48] we still have the part where you and I
[40:51] look at many times when things transpire
[40:54] we look and say Lord what's taking place
[40:58] and then it begins to within that of a
[41:01] believer through times in our lives we
[41:04] begin to learn in that moment of the
[41:07] strength of through reflection in our
[41:10] own life because remember the prophet
[41:12] would take us in the message be certain
[41:14] of God and he would he would speak to us
[41:16] over and over and even through his own
[41:18] life of where there would come times in
[41:20] his own life, he said, where he would
[41:22] turn over every stone and he would pour
[41:25] through these things in his life because
[41:28] uh of to actually be be to be certain of
[41:31] God. And you know, listen, where when we
[41:34] know that where we're standing with God
[41:35] as far as that we have passed from death
[41:37] unto life, but as a believer, our lives
[41:40] as a believer, it never is to be a life
[41:43] of a of just presuming. But it's a life
[41:46] of reflection and it's a life that we
[41:49] recognize that over and over that in our
[41:52] lives that there are things that can
[41:53] come that can accumulate but yet we want
[41:56] to be standing with a certainty and God
[41:58] gives us grace to be able to stand in
[42:01] that way and to think that when the
[42:03] rapture itself and the achievement of
[42:05] that is how that the love of God will
[42:08] have been able to achieve within the
[42:11] hearts and lives of the believers and
[42:14] bring us into that capstone of Christ
[42:17] himself as he sets down upon the church.
[42:20] Now, we realize that we're living under
[42:22] the capstone revelation. We know that
[42:24] we're living under where the head has
[42:26] returned to the body. But to understand
[42:29] that that head coming to the body, it is
[42:31] the light. It is the word. It is the
[42:33] strength that is needed in order to
[42:36] bring the church of the living God into
[42:38] perfection and into its place so that
[42:41] the rapture itself and the change of the
[42:43] body might come to pass. Because
[42:46] remember Paul wrote in the in the book
[42:48] of Hebrews, the very last scripture in
[42:50] Hebrews 11 that they without us should
[42:53] not be made perfect. And when we think
[42:55] of the age and the time that we're
[42:57] living in, all the other ages,
[42:59] everything else is hinging and it's
[43:01] resting on God's achievement taking
[43:05] place in this age through our lives.
[43:08] I'll tell you, if I looked at that as
[43:09] though that it was my task, I would be
[43:12] overwhelming. But when I can recognize
[43:14] that it's not my task or my ability, but
[43:18] only that we might be able to yield
[43:20] ourselves to God's grace, God himself,
[43:24] he will have, he does have a bride that
[43:27] he will bring to complete maturity and
[43:30] he will present it to himself as a
[43:33] trophy of his grace.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; So, so God has an objective where there
[43:39] is a process. There's a journey. And so
[43:41] within all of this uh we want to know
[43:45] that within it all that we are pursuing
[43:47] the right thing. We could pursue a lot
[43:50] of things in life. There's a lot of
[43:51] things that we could chase after but
[43:53] within it all the thing that is to be
[43:56] the absolute necessity and to be where
[44:00] our lives are centered is to pursue the
[44:03] love of God. And yes, I'm talking about
[44:05] the Holy Spirit and I'm talking about
[44:08] the love of God in our lives that he
[44:11] would grow within our lives and know
[44:13] more or less that we would become uh uh
[44:16] decreased and he would increase because
[44:19] that's really when we think of it the
[44:21] love of God. The love of God is not just
[44:23] something that's minor. It's not just
[44:25] something that well you know we we
[44:28] receive that when we receive the Holy
[44:29] Ghost. We receive a portion of it. But
[44:32] the whole goal is that the love of God
[44:35] would actually work its placing itself
[44:38] into perfection in our life to be over
[44:41] to override, overthrow, and to subdue
[44:44] all things unto himself. And so I can
[44:48] say within it over and over that we
[44:50] definitely need more of the love of God.
[44:52] And when I say more of the love of God,
[44:55] it actually we need more of God to take
[44:58] over more of our lives.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; And so within that, that requires
[45:02] honesty. It requires reflection.
[45:04] Sometimes these things maybe are not
[45:06] comfortable, but to recognize that God
[45:09] is not our enemy. God is not here to
[45:11] condemn us, but he does correct us and
[45:13] he does mind us, remind us of the high
[45:15] calling that we are called to within
[45:18] this life. Paul has went through here
[45:20] and he sets this very last portion that
[45:23] charity itself out of faith, hope and
[45:26] charity of how that charity itself is
[45:29] the greatest. I want you to think of
[45:31] this that charity itself the divine love
[45:34] of almighty God is actually the fountain
[45:37] or the source of these other two things
[45:40] because to re to understand Paul would
[45:42] write that faith works by love. So love
[45:47] is the absolute conduit or what will
[45:49] actually produce faith. Now I'm not just
[45:53] talking about faith to work miracles
[45:55] because 1 Corinthians 13 it speaks of
[45:59] how that though I have faith to move
[46:01] mountains but if I don't have charity it
[46:03] would almost seem like well that should
[46:05] absolutely be given. But it is God's
[46:08] love that could actually move down and
[46:11] where a person can actually come under
[46:13] an anointing and an influence and a gift
[46:16] of God can move right down and faith
[46:19] itself will absolutely move a mountain.
[46:22] faith itself as Paul would write there,
[46:24] you know, that pertains to the gift of
[46:26] healing, miracles, and that faith that
[46:28] it would work even to understand all
[46:30] mysteries where be able to so lay out
[46:33] the scriptures and and quotes and
[46:35] everything just be so so lined up in
[46:38] such a way, but yet if charity is not
[46:41] there, it's nothing.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; So Paul sets it in the opening part of
[46:46] this chapter. Paul's not discounting all
[46:49] of those things, but he's saying that do
[46:51] not pursue after that. Do not pursue
[46:56] after being able to explain everything
[46:58] or to pursue after gifts and great
[47:01] supernatural things. Don't pursue. Don't
[47:03] rest on it. Don't lean on it. But make
[47:06] there be. Let there be one pursuit in
[47:08] our life and that's charity. Because
[47:10] after all, it's charity that will
[47:13] actually give faith. And now the faith
[47:15] that we're talking about here is
[47:17] bridematerial faith. We're talking about
[47:19] faith to where that even when God says
[47:22] no, your faith remains constant. To
[47:26] where when you prayed and it seems like
[47:28] you're not getting any answer, like the
[47:30] little woman, the Stadcliffe sister when
[47:32] she thought that she did not have faith
[47:35] or sufficient faith because God took her
[47:38] little child on home. But the prophet
[47:41] said, "No, you have great faith,
[47:44] sister." Now, you see how how contrary
[47:46] that is to our minds. We would look at
[47:48] that and think, well, if it was great
[47:50] faith, then surely God would have sent
[47:53] the prophet AC across the sea in the jet
[47:56] that was provided. But God would
[47:58] actually give a display of the holding
[48:01] power of the faith of God. Because faith
[48:04] does not mean that we understand
[48:06] everything or know everything. But faith
[48:09] itself is that where we're able by the
[48:11] grace of God to trust him. When someone
[48:14] can come to us and say, "Do you
[48:16] understand this? Why your loved one or
[48:18] why this?" And you can absolutely stand
[48:21] there and say without any pride or any
[48:24] reservation, I don't understand. It does
[48:26] not make sense to me, but I trust him.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; That's where love itself will generate a
[48:34] faith that holds in the hour of
[48:37] temptation. It's where faith itself or
[48:40] love will actually is the one that
[48:42] produces a right hope because remember
[48:45] hope is a timid sort of thing. And if
[48:48] and if hope is you know instead of faith
[48:50] well you don't want hope instead of
[48:51] faith. But actually faith is what would
[48:54] deliver us a substance of things hoped
[48:57] or expected for. And the only way that
[49:00] can come about is through charity.
[49:03] Because one of the last attributes of
[49:06] charity in 1 Corinthians 13 is it
[49:09] hopeeth all things
[49:12] &gt;&gt; to where that no matter what takes
[49:13] place, I hope.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; I trust. Oh, brother Samuel, hope's such
[49:17] a bad word. Then why did God put that in
[49:19] there?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Why did it say that Paul that Abraham
[49:22] would hope against hope? Because we
[49:24] understand that within this, we're not
[49:27] talking about something that is
[49:29] altogether timid, but we're looking at
[49:32] the love of God within our lives to
[49:34] where when we have prayed the prayer of
[49:36] faith. Let me just give you an example.
[49:38] In the Hebrew series, the prophet speaks
[49:40] of how that, you know, he went and he
[49:43] prayed for an individual and he says how
[49:45] that he went and prayed for this this
[49:46] this this individual right there at
[49:48] Jeffersonville. And here when the
[49:50] individual asked brother Brandham, the
[49:52] man asked brother, "Brother Ram, do you
[49:53] believe I'm going to get well?" Brother
[49:55] Ram said, "I absolutely do, brother, and
[49:57] he rehearsed the brother the promises of
[49:59] the scripture." Well, long story short,
[50:03] the brother passed on and went home to
[50:05] be with the Lord. But the his wife got
[50:07] upset at brother Brandham and she was so
[50:10] mad because she said, "You gave him a
[50:13] false hope. Look what you did." And
[50:15] brother Brandham, here was his response.
[50:17] He he did said I did not have a vision
[50:20] because remember prophets cannot make
[50:22] themselves have visions. But brother
[50:25] Brandham actually approaches to this to
[50:27] the to the lady and he says how would
[50:29] you have wanted me to come into that
[50:32] home? So brother Brandham wasn't giving
[50:34] him a false hope. It was according to
[50:36] God's word. Just like when we pray we
[50:39] lay hands as the Bible says under
[50:41] general orders. They shall lay hands on
[50:43] the sick and they shall recover. Now if
[50:46] there is specific orders that comes that
[50:48] says regarding this surgery regarding
[50:50] that then that's a direct word from the
[50:52] Lord that will override the general
[50:55] orders. But the general orders is what
[50:57] we as the church of the living God and
[50:59] under the love of God in our life will
[51:01] stand upon God's word. We don't have to
[51:05] see a vision. I don't need a word from
[51:07] the Lord. I appreciate having a word
[51:09] from the Lord. There's many times, no
[51:10] doubt, I would want that. But I want to
[51:12] be careful because I don't want to go
[51:14] around where I begin to pull things of
[51:17] what I want. God knows what you and I
[51:20] have need of. Is that right?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; So to understand the love of God, we'll
[51:25] stand right there on God's word and say,
[51:27] "Lord, I trust you because this is what
[51:30] you have said in your word." You see
[51:32] what God what the love of God has done
[51:35] and is doing within a bride of Jesus
[51:38] Christ to actually bring about a people
[51:41] that will stand upon God's word simply
[51:45] because he said it.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; What love to stand there. That's just
[51:50] like that little woman who was standing
[51:52] there waiting on the owner's son to
[51:54] return cuz he made a promise to her. She
[51:57] never had any word in the meantime. She
[51:59] never had any vision in the meantime.
[52:00] Don't get me wrong, but what was she
[52:02] standing on? His word. We appreciate
[52:05] words. We appreciate visions. But let me
[52:07] tell you something. When all of those
[52:09] things are set aside, it's got to be the
[52:11] where our faith is anchored in God's
[52:14] word above everything else.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[52:19] Because notice when Paul would write of
[52:22] this and to understand this that in
[52:24] pursuing the right thing of how that
[52:27] God's love is to be the very source that
[52:31] we pursue after. I I think it's there's
[52:33] a lot of things like I said that we
[52:34] could chase after, pursue after. But if
[52:37] we miss that of the love of God, we've
[52:40] missed everything.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to watch how Brother
[52:43] Brandham would would say this here in
[52:45] this quote. And I want you to just just
[52:47] just pay attention to this in in this
[52:49] statement here. I've referred to it many
[52:51] times, but I I want to bring it and read
[52:52] it to you right here. Brother Bram says,
[52:54] "After this morning, the Holy Spirit so
[52:57] beautifully coming down and bathing us
[52:59] in his great beauty. I was just inspired
[53:03] to speak them words and say that some
[53:06] glorious day that all of the gifts
[53:09] that's in the church will just be set
[53:11] aside on the mantle as it was." And the
[53:16] Holy Spirit himself will just take the
[53:19] church in such a control of divine love
[53:23] until the sick will be healed. The blind
[53:26] will see, the lame will walk without
[53:29] being hands laid on them. It'll just be
[53:32] one great unity.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Now, I've heard this quote referred to
[53:38] as a millennium quote. My question is is
[53:41] why in the world would I need healing in
[53:44] the millennium?
[53:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to need healing in the
[53:48] millennium. But you see when brother
[53:49] Brandham says this set aside now you
[53:52] understand that within it you can have
[53:54] things where and all of a sudden within
[53:56] the greatness of the revelation that God
[53:58] has given us as though that revelation
[54:01] it takes us beyond all of these things.
[54:04] Revelation does not take us beyond the
[54:06] scriptures. I'll tell you, if there's
[54:08] any revelation or so-called revelation
[54:11] that takes us beyond God's word, I don't
[54:14] want it.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything outside of this
[54:18] word.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; I know he can do things outside of it,
[54:21] but I'm just happy for him fulfilling
[54:24] what's wrote in here. And how many times
[54:26] over and over we've heard the prophet of
[54:28] God tell us over and over all the way
[54:31] clear all the way through. Sure he deals
[54:33] with not resting upon gifts and
[54:36] supernatural things as far as a
[54:38] vindication of our life within Christ.
[54:42] That's true. But God never took the
[54:44] gifts out of the church. They are a part
[54:48] of the journey. They are needful all
[54:51] along the way. So in the scripture that
[54:53] I read for the text here regarding
[54:56] prophecy itself that it will cease how
[54:59] those things will fail. It was not
[55:01] speaking of failure it was speaking of
[55:03] that they are elements of time and when
[55:06] time itself has commenced and we step
[55:10] into eternity there will not be any more
[55:13] need for one of these nine spiritual
[55:16] gifts on the other side.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; There will not be I'll never preach
[55:19] another sermon. I say, "Glory be to
[55:21] God." I'll never preach another sermon.
[55:24] Incredible to me. For those of you that
[55:26] are singers, I I I'm I'm glad because
[55:28] right there, the prophet said they'll be
[55:30] singing on the other side. Hallelujah.
[55:33] But I I'll just be honest with you. I I
[55:35] I'll be grateful, you know, within it.
[55:36] I'm I'm not saying that reluctantly. I'm
[55:38] just saying that with when it all is
[55:40] said and done, these are things that God
[55:42] has allotted to us in time. So to set
[55:45] aside these as the prophet would speak
[55:48] of it in that verse. They are not to be
[55:50] the focus or the measuring rod or the
[55:53] spirituality or even to be a criteria of
[55:56] what is a dead church or what is a
[55:58] living church. I tell you many times
[56:00] when you hear things that way it is
[56:03] manmade labels that have been come up
[56:06] with. You do not find the prophet of God
[56:08] bringing around and bringing comparisons
[56:10] in that way. But men will try to do
[56:13] that. And you say, "Where is that coming
[56:14] from?" It's not coming from charity or
[56:17] from divine love. That is coming from
[56:20] something that is not of the source of
[56:22] God. There could be a right-on perfect
[56:25] absolutely wonderful individual, but God
[56:28] never called you and I to compare
[56:30] ourselves to one another and run one
[56:32] another down. That is not what charity
[56:34] or the love of God will do. As a matter
[56:36] of fact, the prophet would stand right
[56:38] on the platform and say, "I have my
[56:40] trinitarian brethren over here, one
[56:42] that's over here. Brethren, you're both
[56:43] wrong, but let's weave our nets together
[56:46] and let's make a great cast for the
[56:48] kingdom of God." Charity is not an
[56:51] expression or an anointing that seeks to
[56:54] divide or bring exclusive exclus
[56:57] exclusiveness and and highlight and
[56:59] exalt that that the charity does not do
[57:01] that. But the real love of God seeks to
[57:04] exalt Jesus Christ.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; So it's not the measuring rod being set
[57:12] aside. In other words, where this does
[57:14] not become the measuring rod of
[57:16] spirituality among the body of
[57:18] believers. You know, brother Ram tells
[57:19] us that Pentecost took genuine articles
[57:22] says this in the message all things they
[57:24] took genuine articles, supernatural
[57:27] articles and made a tradition out of
[57:30] them. Yeah.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; How do you take supernatural articles
[57:34] and make a tradition out of it? Because
[57:37] when that has to be going on
[57:39] &gt;&gt; in order for there to be a service,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; if I didn't run in this service, if I
[57:44] didn't shout in this service, if I
[57:45] didn't dance in this service, if we
[57:47] didn't speak in tongues, listen, we
[57:49] believe in all those things, but but
[57:51] that is not a criteria for what is a
[57:54] spiritual service.
[57:57] A spiritual service is where Christ
[58:00] himself has come down to speak
[58:03] personally to the lives of his people.
[58:06] It might make you run. It might make you
[58:08] shout. The spirit of God might fall. And
[58:11] there's a need in the building and God
[58:13] will give utterance. But all of that is
[58:16] based on the word.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody hearing me now?
[58:22] &gt;&gt; So it's set aside doesn't mean put on
[58:24] the mantle. It's like I told one
[58:26] individual, I said, "You know, when
[58:27] anybody knows," I said, "Brother Brandon
[58:29] was a country boy. He was a southerner."
[58:31] I said, "Let me tell you something. When
[58:32] you put things on the mantle in a
[58:34] southern home, it ain't like Cracker
[58:36] Barrel
[58:38] where they got the gun hanging up there,
[58:40] you couldn't use that gun if you tried.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; But you know how it is in a southern
[58:45] house or whatever. When they put that
[58:47] gun over over the fireplace, buddy, if
[58:49] there's a possum that shows up, if
[58:51] there's a bothering their dog, if
[58:53] they need to go deer hunting, they will
[58:55] take that off and they will use it as
[58:58] needed. And God through the ministry of
[59:02] Malachi 4 has placed the gifts in
[59:05] position for the body of Christ. They're
[59:08] not obsolete. They're not out of date,
[59:11] but it's right there as we have need of
[59:14] it.
[59:17] Hallelujah.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But rather we want to we want
[59:20] complete rest through divine love and to
[59:23] be yielding and satisfied in him that we
[59:26] need no other greater vindication of his
[59:28] presence in our lives but just as new
[59:30] creatures being molded in his image. And
[59:33] these things as I said they are needful
[59:35] through this part of the journey where
[59:38] you and I are at in this moment.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Now think of this. Let me let me go to
[59:42] the scriptures here in Ephesians 4 and
[59:45] verse 11. It says he gave some now these
[59:48] are church offices not church gifts. He
[59:50] gave some apostles and prophets and
[59:53] evangelists and pastors and teachers.
[59:54] And I say we need every part of the
[59:57] five-fold ministry.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Everyone even every pastor God there's
[1:00:03] such a uniqueness and how that God has
[1:00:05] the gift and how that he has it with an
[1:00:07] evangelist. Every part is needed. So you
[1:00:11] wonder what Sam what are you saying? I'm
[1:00:12] saying that a pastor cannot fulfill
[1:00:16] everything that's needed for his local
[1:00:19] congregation.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. That's where I
[1:00:23] stand because God placed it in the body.
[1:00:26] There are evangelists and they are
[1:00:29] specialists just like God has apostles.
[1:00:31] God has each one of them. They are are
[1:00:34] specialists that God will use in such a
[1:00:37] way. Remember brother Brand talks about
[1:00:39] the evangelist. Think about it. The
[1:00:40] evangelist don't know none of you all.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; He don't know one thing about you. And
[1:00:47] here he comes in. Brother Bam, I can see
[1:00:49] him as a ball of fire. He'll come right
[1:00:51] down blazing the trail. You know what?
[1:00:53] He don't have to worry about text the
[1:00:55] next day. He don't worry about cleanup,
[1:00:59] right? Just like a guy who comes in,
[1:01:01] throws a party, he don't worry about the
[1:01:03] cleanup afterwards. He don't worry about
[1:01:05] if there's tablecloths everywhere, cake
[1:01:07] on the floor. It doesn't matter if
[1:01:08] there's chairs scattered. He came and he
[1:01:11] did his job. And that's how God would
[1:01:13] use that of an evangelist. I'm thankful
[1:01:15] for that. Aren't you? That God would
[1:01:17] come down and use that to so you and I,
[1:01:19] you know, God don't have to do that. But
[1:01:21] he does that his love and care. You know
[1:01:23] what that is? That shows a lot of
[1:01:25] longsuffering on God's part to put up
[1:01:27] with our humanity. So that where you and
[1:01:31] I could be able, we could not say, "Oh,
[1:01:33] he's saying that because of brother
[1:01:34] Samuel or he's saying that." Come on,
[1:01:36] friends. You know how the enemy will try
[1:01:38] to get on your mind? He'll try to get on
[1:01:40] your shoulder. He'll want to make you
[1:01:42] think that one message has been studied
[1:01:44] out for you. Let me just save you the
[1:01:46] time.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I don't study messages based on
[1:01:49] individuals. As a matter of fact, most
[1:01:51] of the things that I minister have been
[1:01:54] setting for months and things just
[1:01:57] continue to work within a series.
[1:01:59] They've been setting and waiting on the
[1:02:01] spirit of God. As a matter of fact, the
[1:02:03] things that I've been preaching here out
[1:02:05] of the love of God, I was planning on
[1:02:07] preaching that way back in February, but
[1:02:10] the spirit of God would not allow me to
[1:02:12] do it then at that time.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; But we're always wanting God's time and
[1:02:17] God's season. This is why we have to
[1:02:19] know the seasons to be in and out of.
[1:02:21] Notice for the perfecting of the saints.
[1:02:23] Now, I want you to understand this. this
[1:02:25] perfecting of the saints, your
[1:02:27] perfection. Paul is not speaking of your
[1:02:30] perfection as far as what comes through
[1:02:33] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ perfects you.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; It cleanses you. It plays here through
[1:02:42] the blood. It brings a perfection then
[1:02:44] of his life coming into your life and
[1:02:47] placing you in the body where you belong
[1:02:50] in in in the body of Jesus Christ in the
[1:02:53] word. That's something that's alone
[1:02:55] between you and God. Well, the other
[1:02:57] parts is also God working. But this
[1:03:00] perfecting it deals with completion. You
[1:03:03] understand that your birth is not your
[1:03:05] adoption.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; We must be born again, but your birth is
[1:03:09] not your adoption. The adoption, there
[1:03:12] is a growing that is to take place
[1:03:14] within our life. a submitting that's to
[1:03:16] take place because God's desire is to
[1:03:19] bring every one of his sons and
[1:03:21] daughters into adoption. And so it's
[1:03:24] God's placing. So God gave the ministry
[1:03:26] for the perfecting or the completing of
[1:03:29] the saints for the work of the ministry
[1:03:32] for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[1:03:35] So it's it's kind of like this when you
[1:03:37] see this this scripture here that that
[1:03:39] Paul would write about how that the man
[1:03:41] of God might be thoroughly furnished. I
[1:03:43] don't know about you, but like I said
[1:03:45] before, when my wife and I when we first
[1:03:47] got married and had a double wide built
[1:03:48] and that double wide was brought in in
[1:03:50] and in and there in our house, mine,
[1:03:52] yeah, we had a house, but you know what?
[1:03:54] We didn't have no chairs to sit on.
[1:03:57] We had no chair set on. It was
[1:03:59] wonderful, but we we had no chairs. You
[1:04:01] know, we did we had those great Dollar
[1:04:03] General plastic chairs and we set them
[1:04:06] out. Hey, it was better than sitting on
[1:04:07] the floor.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; That's what we had at that time. And you
[1:04:10] know what? Little by little couch, love
[1:04:13] seat. Little by little, you know, you
[1:04:15] get to looking and oh, can how how is
[1:04:17] this looking for this year? Well, this
[1:04:18] year we'll set back for this and you get
[1:04:20] one end table. Then you get another end
[1:04:22] table. Then you get a lamp. Then you get
[1:04:23] a bedroom suit. Then you get this.
[1:04:25] Little by little, it was not sorry. We
[1:04:27] weren't rich. It wasn't something where
[1:04:29] mom and dad just said, "Here, here's the
[1:04:31] checkbook, and y'all can go to the go to
[1:04:33] the nearest Amish store down there and
[1:04:35] just load it up." Boy, I would have
[1:04:37] liked that. But you know what? It took
[1:04:39] little by little. But you know what? I'm
[1:04:41] so appreciative of the things that we do
[1:04:43] have. I know, you know, it might seem
[1:04:45] like, oh, this old honeywood, like here,
[1:04:47] fruit, it's out of style, but it's out
[1:04:49] of style and it's paid for. I'd rather
[1:04:51] it be out of style than paid for. Oh,
[1:04:53] you might be able to paint it white,
[1:04:54] then all of a sudden somebody changes
[1:04:56] their mind and this is the latest,
[1:04:57] greatest color, fluorescent pink with
[1:04:59] green dots on it, and you know, you can
[1:05:01] paint it this way. I listen friends,
[1:05:03] this is what I'm saying. That little by
[1:05:05] little, our home was a furnished. And
[1:05:07] that's the same way it is with your walk
[1:05:10] and my walk with God. God don't come and
[1:05:12] completely outfit the whole thing in
[1:05:15] your life. But it's little by little by
[1:05:18] little by little, he is furnishing your
[1:05:20] life.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; G
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; so that in every part of our life, it
[1:05:25] will reflect him. Hallelujah.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; There's not be a room that he couldn't
[1:05:28] go to in our life and not be able to
[1:05:31] feel comfortable
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; God
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:05:36] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:05:38] the body of Christ till we all come in
[1:05:41] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:05:43] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[1:05:46] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:05:48] stature of the fullness of Christ. Now,
[1:05:50] this unity of the faith does not mean
[1:05:53] bringing us all to where everybody
[1:05:54] thinks the same.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody thinks like brother Samuel.
[1:05:59] God don't want everybody thinking like
[1:06:00] brother Samuel.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; You know what? God would even allow
[1:06:03] things, you know, God will allow things
[1:06:05] to test and see, can we handle
[1:06:08] differences?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. You brother Samuel you
[1:06:16] mean that God did not mean that
[1:06:18] everybody listen friends even among the
[1:06:21] deacons even of how that we would work
[1:06:23] together there's things at times that
[1:06:25] they haven't seen eye to eye with me but
[1:06:27] when we look at it and we pray about it
[1:06:29] and I said look let's commit it let's
[1:06:31] operate it in this way you see it isn't
[1:06:33] about that we all we all got to see eye
[1:06:36] to eye on the major principle things yes
[1:06:40] on that of the new birth absolutely on
[1:06:43] that of the But there might be
[1:06:45] variations. Maybe how a brother sees
[1:06:48] this or how a brother sees this or a
[1:06:50] sister sees this. But you and I have to
[1:06:53] make a decision. Not God. We have to
[1:06:55] make a decision. Are we going to make
[1:06:57] our differences an issue or are we going
[1:07:01] to pursue after the love of God that
[1:07:03] will allow us to stand united?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Till we all come what?
[1:07:14] Till we all come to BSWT? No. Till we
[1:07:18] all come under this pastor? No. Till we
[1:07:20] all get this brother's sermons? No. It's
[1:07:24] not that's not God's desire.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; God has given us a one-man message.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit coming through that
[1:07:35] vessel now is broke apart. And now
[1:07:38] through the vessels and those that are
[1:07:40] faithfully taught with the same spirit
[1:07:42] of God have the same objective that
[1:07:45] operated in the heart of that messenger.
[1:07:48] And that's to see a true spiritual
[1:07:50] relationship. Don't get me wrong. I want
[1:07:53] everybody to have victory, but I do not
[1:07:55] want your victory and your joy to be
[1:07:58] tied to this man right here. I want your
[1:08:01] victory and your joy to be completely in
[1:08:04] Jesus Christ. Will God operate and does
[1:08:06] he through this channel? Yes. But it's
[1:08:09] with the objective that whether I'm here
[1:08:11] tomorrow or not, or whether you can get
[1:08:13] a hold of me tomorrow or not, your
[1:08:16] victory is in Jesus Christ.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not a group walk.
[1:08:22] It's an individual walk
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; until unto the perfect man, unto the
[1:08:28] knowledge of the son of God. Oh my. So
[1:08:32] much we could say on that. unto the
[1:08:34] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:08:36] of Christ, that we be that we henceforth
[1:08:39] be no more children, tossed to and fro,
[1:08:41] carried about with every wind of
[1:08:43] doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:08:45] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie and
[1:08:47] wait to deceive.
[1:08:49] You know, I I realize that
[1:08:52] sometimes as our children and things,
[1:08:54] they're coming into certain places in
[1:08:56] their life. you know, you have to just
[1:08:58] kind of listen and wait and watch
[1:09:00] because there's sometimes where there's
[1:09:01] things that they have to make decisions.
[1:09:04] They're coming into times where they've
[1:09:05] got to make decisions. But I I do I
[1:09:07] don't believe that God intended us and I
[1:09:10] do this according I'm saying this
[1:09:12] according to how that he works that God
[1:09:14] himself is not a handsoff God.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; It's true that God will help us when we
[1:09:21] make mistakes. He'll correct us. That's
[1:09:22] exactly right. He's right there. But God
[1:09:25] is also wanting to influence us and
[1:09:27] guide us. And sometimes there's things
[1:09:30] that God will listen when we get in our
[1:09:32] head to do something, God will allow us
[1:09:34] to go ahead and do it. But remember,
[1:09:36] there's many times when we come and
[1:09:38] begin to realize as we'll present
[1:09:40] something to the Lord and the Lord will
[1:09:42] wait on him. We begin to learn through
[1:09:44] experiences in our walk with God, we
[1:09:47] begin to learn the value
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; of waiting on him.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, what allows learning to take
[1:09:54] place? The love that's expressed over
[1:09:57] our lives.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; And there's things that how that God
[1:10:00] will deal with our hearts cuz he
[1:10:02] realized, wait a minute, they they they
[1:10:03] take this this too this too much of a
[1:10:05] turn right here, too much of an angle
[1:10:07] right here. Mine will send them way off
[1:10:08] over here. And so God will listen and
[1:10:11] he'll bring he'll bring a direction and
[1:10:12] and actually cause us to be able to
[1:10:15] reflect. You know, there's a lot of
[1:10:16] things that God will say yes, God will
[1:10:18] say no. And then there's times where God
[1:10:20] brings us in our life to where you and I
[1:10:23] come have to come to a place and we
[1:10:25] begin to reflect. How many knows that's
[1:10:26] a learning place where you begin to
[1:10:28] realize, wait a minute here, I I I made
[1:10:30] there's all the mistakes I've made, I've
[1:10:32] not made it because of God. I've made
[1:10:34] those mistakes because of not waiting on
[1:10:36] him.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Right? I've made it. Maybe I felt
[1:10:39] something. I felt an impression. Felt
[1:10:41] this or whatever more. But you know
[1:10:43] what? Hey, listen. Let me tell you what
[1:10:44] a blessing it is. You know you're a rare
[1:10:46] breed if you can admit that you make
[1:10:48] mistakes.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You're
[1:10:51] actually part of St. John 5:19. The son
[1:10:53] can do nothing of himself but what he
[1:10:55] seeth the father doing. God bringing us
[1:10:57] to the realization over and over. It
[1:10:59] isn't God pushing us through, pulling us
[1:11:00] through, but it's waiting on God and for
[1:11:03] God to work and move within our lives to
[1:11:06] do what? What is the purpose in this
[1:11:09] first part of this of this verse? You
[1:11:11] realize that after the spirit of God has
[1:11:13] taken a hold of a life that the spirit
[1:11:16] of God coming into your life is the rest
[1:11:19] of the Holy Spirit. The re
[1:11:23] and it becomes the absolute objective of
[1:11:26] the Holy Spirit which is the rest of God
[1:11:29] to bring you the first place into rest.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; You understanding me now? to bring you
[1:11:37] to a place to where you are resting and
[1:11:40] not looking at any other evidence. But
[1:11:42] the Holy Spirit, what what did Paul do
[1:11:45] for those three years that he studied
[1:11:46] down there in Arabia? What was taking
[1:11:49] place? The Holy Spirit was bringing him
[1:11:52] into the reality of the rest that he was
[1:11:56] already in.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. It's evidence because
[1:12:03] you know why? Rest is where you're
[1:12:05] settled.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; It's where you've settled in where God
[1:12:09] has brought you through. Because before
[1:12:10] you're settled, oh my, you know, the
[1:12:13] enemy can can beat you up here and he
[1:12:15] can beat you up there. Remember, brother
[1:12:16] Ram said he had to learn as a young
[1:12:18] Christian not to go by his feelings. And
[1:12:20] you can have things to where that the
[1:12:22] enemy the enemy can take quotes and
[1:12:24] scriptures and he can interpret it this
[1:12:26] way. He can have you believing that a
[1:12:28] man full of the Holy Ghost is somehow a
[1:12:31] perfect man, a sinless man, a man that
[1:12:34] doesn't make mistakes. And that is not
[1:12:36] what not so whatsoever. The sinlessness
[1:12:39] and perfection is that from our soul to
[1:12:42] where the when the worshipper is once
[1:12:44] purged. He has no more desire for sin.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Is that right? This is why the prophet
[1:12:51] said, "Don't ever get in your mind that
[1:12:54] you'll live so perfect to where you
[1:12:56] don't make a mistake."
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I think an old dear old dear sister
[1:13:04] Smith, you know, I just started
[1:13:06] pastoring and she would go to certain
[1:13:08] meetings and things like that that she
[1:13:09] would go to, you know, she her and
[1:13:11] brother Bill had went to for so many
[1:13:12] years and things and it's meetings in
[1:13:14] another location and place and she got
[1:13:16] she said, "Brother Samuel," she said, "I
[1:13:18] got some tapes." She said, "I want you
[1:13:19] to hear." She said, "I don't know." And
[1:13:21] she loved this, "Dear brother, dear
[1:13:23] pastor, my what a wonderful brother, you
[1:13:25] know, and things like that." But here
[1:13:27] here, you know, she said, "I want you to
[1:13:28] hear this." Well, I got to listen to
[1:13:30] that. And when I listened to it, I
[1:13:32] thought, "Lord, have mercy." For I said,
[1:13:34] "If this is to be the closing sermon in
[1:13:37] that brother's meetings, I can tell you
[1:13:39] everybody walked out of there with their
[1:13:41] head down there probably underneath the
[1:13:43] carpet feeling so bad and terrible
[1:13:45] because you know why? It was preached as
[1:13:47] though that the Holy Ghost produces a
[1:13:49] glorified body. But that is not what the
[1:13:52] Holy Ghost has come to do. The token
[1:13:54] life comes on the inside to transform
[1:13:57] and change an individual and bring them
[1:13:59] into a place to where they're subject to
[1:14:01] the word and teachable.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Well, glory.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Now, awful lot of freebies, but I'm not
[1:14:10] getting anywhere.
[1:14:13] But notice, but speaking the truth in
[1:14:16] love,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; may grow up into him in all things,
[1:14:21] which is the head, even Christ, from
[1:14:24] whom, watch this, the whole body fitly
[1:14:27] joined together, and compacted by that
[1:14:30] which every joint supplieth, according
[1:14:34] to the effectual working in the measure
[1:14:36] of every part, maketh increase of the
[1:14:40] body unto the edifying of itself. self
[1:14:43] in love. So it's simply put as God works
[1:14:47] within our life,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; remember how the spirit of God will so
[1:14:51] take place in our lives as far as God
[1:14:54] will establish every one of these things
[1:14:56] in a very very small measure
[1:15:02] and the spirit of God moves in our life.
[1:15:04] But then for after that then here comes
[1:15:06] a growing within our lives. Brother
[1:15:10] Samuel, what are you saying? I I'm
[1:15:11] saying right here that your faith grows
[1:15:15] and it grows after you've been born
[1:15:18] again.
[1:15:20] Virtue grows.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Patience grows. All of these things.
[1:15:26] When it says add to, it's speaking of
[1:15:29] increase. So you have God filling an
[1:15:32] individual with that of the new birth.
[1:15:35] And then it grows up unto him in all
[1:15:39] things.
[1:15:40] It's growing as a believer. It's
[1:15:42] pressing through each one of these parts
[1:15:45] that is moving through on this in this
[1:15:48] great stature of a perfect man. Notice
[1:15:50] unto the measure of the stature of his
[1:15:53] fullness. This is why that reality is
[1:15:56] our patience in serving God should be
[1:15:58] greater now than it was before.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Virtue should be greater now than what
[1:16:03] it was before. You see, it's not just
[1:16:06] something, well, I got this and now I'm
[1:16:07] going to go after this and now I'm going
[1:16:08] to go after this and now I'm going to go
[1:16:10] after this. There's a movement that
[1:16:12] taught it in that way. And that's not
[1:16:14] what brother Brandham was saying
[1:16:15] whatsoever. Because if you place it that
[1:16:17] way, then you got brother Brandham
[1:16:19] standing at the end of Statue of Perfect
[1:16:21] Man and he don't even have the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost. Because at the end of it, Brother
[1:16:25] Ram says, "With my hands up before this
[1:16:27] congregation, I pledge that I will not
[1:16:29] rest until I see every one of these
[1:16:33] virtues living through my life."
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; And remember, remember, he said,
[1:16:38] "Without that," he said, "you cannot
[1:16:40] even start on this until you're born
[1:16:42] again." Because until you're born again,
[1:16:45] it's like trying to put peacock feathers
[1:16:47] in a blackbird.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; So, what does it have to do? It's got to
[1:16:51] be something that comes from the inside
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; out. So charity, it's charity leads you.
[1:16:58] It'll always draw us upward. It draws us
[1:17:02] above that conditional love that that
[1:17:06] felio love, that conditional part that
[1:17:09] you and I came and were born with in
[1:17:11] this world. And everything's based on if
[1:17:14] if I like somebody
[1:17:17] and if I don't,
[1:17:20] If they do me good, they do me bad. You
[1:17:24] and I were born with that. Brother says
[1:17:27] there's there's some people in this
[1:17:29] earth that have these these virtues in a
[1:17:32] natural way, but it's got to come to
[1:17:35] where it's the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the spiritual virtue.
[1:17:39] It's got to be Christ working in our
[1:17:41] life. And this is why that Paul would
[1:17:43] write and say follow or pursue
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; after charity
[1:17:49] and desire spiritual gifts. So nowhere
[1:17:53] did Paul say get rid of the gifts, but
[1:17:55] he said pursue or follow charity. If
[1:17:58] there's one thing that you're going to
[1:17:59] be pursuing in your life, let it be
[1:18:03] charity.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Now watch how how brother Brandon will
[1:18:07] bring this about. He says, "Let God add
[1:18:09] to the church. Let God give to the
[1:18:11] church. Those gifts are in the church.
[1:18:15] Right in here this morning is gifts of
[1:18:17] speaking in tongues, gifts of prophecy.
[1:18:19] There's gifts of everything setting in
[1:18:21] here. But if you'll just not go to
[1:18:23] hanging after that gift. So even right
[1:18:26] in here tonight, remember brother Ram
[1:18:28] says those those church gifts, he said
[1:18:30] they meal throughout the body. It might
[1:18:32] be on this one tonight, never be on them
[1:18:35] again.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Might be on this one over here. Church
[1:18:37] gifts are not the same thing as church
[1:18:39] offices.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Church offices are predestinated of
[1:18:43] gifts that God has set within that man's
[1:18:46] life before even before when he comes
[1:18:49] he's born that gift already lays within
[1:18:51] his life. But here within these these
[1:18:53] gifts are right here within the church.
[1:18:56] But don't go hanging after them. He says
[1:19:00] if you do, you're going to get the gift
[1:19:02] without the giver. The thing of it is
[1:19:05] seek after God. Seek after love of God
[1:19:09] in your heart. And then as God wants
[1:19:13] you, he'll move you into whatever he
[1:19:16] wants you to do. That's it. That's how
[1:19:18] the church is put in order.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; so in other words, being a stewardship
[1:19:27] be available. Now, you know, being a
[1:19:29] stewardship is not just about having a
[1:19:32] clean life. That should be should be a
[1:19:35] testimony. But do you realize that even
[1:19:38] that is a person within a testimony that
[1:19:40] listen whether it's special singing and
[1:19:42] listen friends I believe in forgiveness.
[1:19:44] I believe there ought to be only one
[1:19:45] thing in the house of God. There ought
[1:19:47] to be forgiveness in the house of God.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Is that right? But a stewardship itself
[1:19:52] is where that an individual whether or
[1:19:55] not that they've ever been used in a
[1:19:57] capacity of a gift, but even that much
[1:19:59] more to so that being within that place
[1:20:02] is not to allow anything to be tainted
[1:20:05] to where that Satan himself could come
[1:20:07] in such a way and say I don't have no
[1:20:09] confidence in that right there. That
[1:20:11] will not be the fault of the individuals
[1:20:14] who say I don't have no confidence. That
[1:20:16] is a stewardship that is committed to
[1:20:19] our lives.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Ministers,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; church gifts,
[1:20:25] song leaders,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; those that sing specials,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; it's imperative not just in here, but on
[1:20:31] the outside,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; it's imperative that the character and
[1:20:34] what is on display that that's what
[1:20:36] makes listen friends, it's not even how
[1:20:39] great or how gifted a person is. That's
[1:20:41] not what really means that takes the
[1:20:44] emphasis. It's the character that's
[1:20:46] behind it. I'm talking about divine
[1:20:49] love.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; That's what matters.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's why that a person could say,
[1:20:54] "Well, nobody will hear me." But you
[1:20:56] have to look how is your character been.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; See, if your character is not matching
[1:21:00] out, listen, friends, there's a lot of
[1:21:02] these things I've learned as I've went
[1:21:03] down through the years and other things
[1:21:05] to be able to see that and to be able to
[1:21:07] see that over and over. It's things, you
[1:21:08] know, you see, but God brings them to
[1:21:10] you in even in a greater light. and to
[1:21:11] realize, wait a minute, we're not
[1:21:12] faulting people, but there's got to be a
[1:21:14] character that can actually be received.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's why there's things that even
[1:21:19] that, you know, even right here that I
[1:21:21] can know things and you know, I've had
[1:21:23] individuals say, "Brother Samuel, what
[1:21:24] about brother so and so and man, it'd be
[1:21:26] good to have brother so and so and this
[1:21:27] and that." So, don't get in your mind
[1:21:28] and try to start guessing it. But, you
[1:21:30] see, some of it is I don't ask for
[1:21:32] certain things. I don't ask to know
[1:21:34] things. But sometimes there's things
[1:21:36] that I that will come across your
[1:21:38] pathway and then know that maybe what
[1:21:40] and what a man has done. I believe God
[1:21:41] can forgive him. I believe God can give
[1:21:43] grace to override that. But if I hear
[1:21:46] that that man has caused trouble in
[1:21:48] another person's church and stepped out
[1:21:50] of the lane that God has called him to
[1:21:52] be in and wanted to somehow take in a
[1:21:54] way of a church like a pastorial type of
[1:21:57] a way when he's speaking. I listen
[1:21:59] friends. I wanted this is what I wait
[1:22:01] for. I'm not putting somebody in a
[1:22:03] picture frame to where all I can
[1:22:05] remember is their mistakes. I believe
[1:22:08] that God's grace is sufficient to give
[1:22:10] man grace to overcome. But I will say
[1:22:13] this right here that until that there
[1:22:15] has been a witness and I can see that
[1:22:17] that has actually grown within their
[1:22:20] life. And listen, if God allowed me to
[1:22:22] hear that, then God will also allow me
[1:22:24] to hear the testimony. When an
[1:22:26] individual has been big enough to say,
[1:22:29] "I was wrong and I overstepped the
[1:22:31] mark." I can have confidence in a man
[1:22:34] that's willing to repent. I'm going to
[1:22:36] tell you, to be able to repent, that's
[1:22:38] bride material. Because in this hour,
[1:22:41] there is so much of knowit all to where
[1:22:44] that there's no repentance and
[1:22:46] everything that's done and acting as
[1:22:48] though that well, we can just walk on by
[1:22:50] that. You'll never get any further with
[1:22:52] God until you repent of your wrong.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; So there's a stewardship to be
[1:23:01] available.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Just like a meeting that I came out of.
[1:23:05] I finished ministering and preaching and
[1:23:07] here an individual breaks out speaking
[1:23:10] in tongues. Well, sorry. Broke right out
[1:23:14] in prophecy. Then I come to find out
[1:23:16] after that service.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Sure. my you know I got done I was
[1:23:21] praying we were praying brothers to help
[1:23:22] me we were praying right there you know
[1:23:24] through different needs that were coming
[1:23:25] up but interesting what comes to find
[1:23:28] out is is that the individual itself I
[1:23:30] had no idea who this person was but this
[1:23:33] individual don't even go to church
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; they sit home and just play tapes
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; now I ain't got nothing wrong with
[1:23:42] playing tapes I believe in playing tapes
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; but I also believe that the same voice
[1:23:46] on that tape is the same word that ties
[1:23:48] as a us for sake not to assemble
[1:23:50] yourselves together.
[1:23:52] That's right.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what I'm trying to say. You
[1:23:55] know what it was? I didn't know that.
[1:23:57] But everybody else sitting around in
[1:23:59] that community that this individual has
[1:24:02] also been one that has tracked people
[1:24:04] down in a parking lot and prophesied
[1:24:06] over this one and prophesied over this
[1:24:07] one. You're going to marry this one and
[1:24:09] this one's already engaged.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; You see what happens? It's a loss of
[1:24:15] confidence.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. a loss of confidence for because
[1:24:20] of a lack of stewardship.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not looking down. I'm not
[1:24:25] looking down on that individual. It's
[1:24:27] evident there have no there's no
[1:24:28] headship there in their life. It's
[1:24:30] evident within their life and you know
[1:24:32] just meing around and like that. But I
[1:24:34] pray to God that the individual actually
[1:24:37] gets to a place to where that even a
[1:24:40] person can actually have a real
[1:24:42] confidence in may never be used again to
[1:24:45] speak in tongues or any of those things.
[1:24:46] But there has got to be a measure of
[1:24:49] confidence.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; It's like somebody running all around
[1:24:57] the place and everything else and gets
[1:24:58] up here to sing a special and say,
[1:25:00] "Well, I wonder why that everybody
[1:25:01] wouldn't receive that."
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I wonder.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; I wonder. I wonder. It's because the
[1:25:10] character.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Can God repair characters? Absolutely.
[1:25:15] I've seen him do it.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Now notice this right here. Think of it.
[1:25:21] The way to have fellowship, brother Bram
[1:25:24] says, now
[1:25:26] where there is gifts, they'll bring
[1:25:28] confusion. Where there is gifts, they
[1:25:32] can be questioned, but where there is
[1:25:34] love, it is perfect. And if you had
[1:25:39] perfect love, you'd have perfect gifts.
[1:25:42] So work first with love that brings
[1:25:46] fellowship and fellowship brings gifts.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; So what's first? Love.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Love will bring fellowship.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; So here brother Random just like within
[1:25:59] Paul bringing to the right pursuit of
[1:26:03] all these other things. So you mean
[1:26:05] brother Samuel what what was how how
[1:26:07] would this be what would be an
[1:26:08] illustration of this? I'll tell you how
[1:26:09] it' be an illustration of this. If a
[1:26:11] man, I don't care if he's a preacher, I
[1:26:13] don't care if he seems to be a gifted
[1:26:14] individual. If there's things not right
[1:26:16] in his heart, there's grudges, there's
[1:26:18] everything else, he needs to lay that
[1:26:20] gift aside on the altar,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Lay everything else aside
[1:26:26] and be reconciled to the Lord,
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; and reconciled then to your brother. Not
[1:26:32] just go and say, "Brother, I'm sorry
[1:26:34] that the gift so I can get right back
[1:26:35] into the stream of things." That that's
[1:26:37] the wrong objective. That's not really
[1:26:39] true reconciliation or repentance. It's
[1:26:41] like you going apologizing to your wife
[1:26:43] simply because you don't want your
[1:26:44] stomach growling. That ain't real true.
[1:26:47] That ain't a real true apology. Yeah.
[1:26:49] That's still selfishness,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Right. But when it's got to come from
[1:26:54] something from within our heart.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; So then within it, listen, if there's
[1:26:59] anything at all, this is where it brings
[1:27:01] it down to you and I as individuals
[1:27:04] evaluating our own life before the
[1:27:07] presence of almighty God. Listen
[1:27:08] friends, I wouldn't even want to come
[1:27:10] sit in here if there's things that's in
[1:27:12] my heart. Do you realize if you come and
[1:27:14] sit in here with things in your heart
[1:27:16] and not allow the spirit of God to go to
[1:27:19] work on your life, you can hinder
[1:27:21] somebody from getting a real touch from
[1:27:23] Almighty God. Well, brother Samuel, it's
[1:27:26] because so and so offended me. Do you
[1:27:28] think that that's going to hold up
[1:27:30] before the throne of God? You'll give an
[1:27:32] account for that what took place within
[1:27:35] that service. I didn't say you're going
[1:27:37] to hell, but you will give an account of
[1:27:39] it before the judgment seat of Christ.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends, I we don't want
[1:27:45] to live our lives with him that way. We
[1:27:47] want to live our lives free. We want to
[1:27:49] come in here as free people. Come on
[1:27:51] now. We don't want to come in here with
[1:27:53] bringing and bartering and Lord, I've
[1:27:55] got a right for this and right for that.
[1:27:57] We may have all of our rights, but God,
[1:28:00] let the love of God be what we are
[1:28:02] seeking after.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:06] I read to you a number of quotes months
[1:28:08] ago where the prophet said if God gave
[1:28:11] me the choice he said I'll give you
[1:28:13] every gift or I'll give you what's in
[1:28:15] your life right now or I'll give you
[1:28:17] that of d divine love. He said I
[1:28:19] wouldn't have to think twice about it.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; I will take divine love.
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Now think of this.
[1:28:33] Listen. You think brother Bam's saying
[1:28:35] something here and what I what I'm
[1:28:36] saying this is not according to the word
[1:28:39] the prophet himself even said he even he
[1:28:42] even stands in transparency
[1:28:45] before us multiple times through the
[1:28:47] years
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; but more specifically
[1:28:52] there in 63
[1:28:54] when he had got to a place where he had
[1:28:57] got to such a place he said can you
[1:28:59] imagine that a man could get to a place
[1:29:03] that would see people going over the
[1:29:04] falls and turn and laugh.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm not making up words.
[1:29:10] Standing in the gap.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "That's where I am.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; That's where I am." What had happened?
[1:29:18] He had lost
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; the feeling for the people.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; And he tells us in that message, I'm
[1:29:25] just going to stay around here and and
[1:29:26] preach a little bit. Every message after
[1:29:28] that, humble thyself. Then, you know, he
[1:29:30] he's telling us all the way through even
[1:29:32] through July of 63, he's working working
[1:29:35] out that complex within his life. And he
[1:29:38] says in humble thyself, he says, "I I
[1:29:41] can't," he said, "I I I just can't go
[1:29:43] out there to him because I don't feel
[1:29:46] right."
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And if I don't feel right, I can't help
[1:29:51] him.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; You understand what what the prophet was
[1:29:54] doing? He was honest with the man he saw
[1:29:56] in the mirror. Right.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know about you, but the
[1:30:00] mirrors in my house don't have pictures
[1:30:02] of everybody else.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Anybody else got mirrors like that? You
[1:30:07] might have picture frames. You might
[1:30:09] have picture frames that got reflections
[1:30:10] and you can kind of see yourself if the
[1:30:12] light hits it right away. But if you go
[1:30:14] to looking in the mirror, there's only
[1:30:15] one person you're going to see and
[1:30:17] that's yourself.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And that's why, listen friends, when the
[1:30:20] word's being preached, we ain't looking
[1:30:22] at a picture frame.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; We ain't looking at who's behind us.
[1:30:26] It's us taking inventory of our own
[1:30:29] lives.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; We can look at it and say, "Well, you
[1:30:33] know, I'm not going to accept that.
[1:30:34] That's our choice." But the love of God
[1:30:36] in our hearts and how the spirit of God
[1:30:38] would draw upon our lives, Lord, I want
[1:30:41] to pursue after the love of God.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] Notice in thirsting for life, brother
[1:30:52] said that if the Pentecostal church
[1:30:53] would only satisfy thirst in God instead
[1:30:56] of trying to follow some evangelist,
[1:30:59] some emotion or some little ism or some
[1:31:01] little sensation, how much better off
[1:31:03] it'd be. See, God doesn't want
[1:31:05] somebody's experience, your experience
[1:31:07] or my experience. He don't want it tied
[1:31:09] to some personality.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; God don't want your experience tied to
[1:31:13] an emotion.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; We believe in emotion, don't we?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; We believe in sensations. But God
[1:31:19] doesn't want your experience tied to
[1:31:21] that. Now, let me just say this right
[1:31:23] now. If there was an individual having
[1:31:26] problems or difficulties, just like the
[1:31:28] prophet looked at the one individual
[1:31:30] with a birth path and saw how that the
[1:31:32] stars and everything, how they were born
[1:31:34] under, how their makeup would be and
[1:31:36] they were praying, "Brother Bram, as let
[1:31:37] God let God uh let me speak in tongues
[1:31:40] just so I know I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:31:41] And brother Bram said they were a dandy
[1:31:43] person with the Holy Ghost. He said,
[1:31:45] 'But I would not teach that out there
[1:31:47] because I'd have people running after
[1:31:49] that instead of after the reality. He
[1:31:51] said, but this person already had an
[1:31:52] experience with God. He says, I could
[1:31:54] see that, but he asked God to let them
[1:31:56] speak in tonesues so that they would
[1:31:58] have grounds to at least stand on. Let
[1:32:00] me just tell you something. It was not
[1:32:02] speaking in tonesues that brought rest
[1:32:03] in their life. But it became the conduit
[1:32:06] for the Holy Spirit to bring them to a
[1:32:09] reality of the rest they were already
[1:32:11] in.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? So I I
[1:32:14] I'll just say it like this. I I I do
[1:32:16] believe that there's things and requests
[1:32:18] that maybe a person could make, but you
[1:32:21] know what? God in his grace, I believe
[1:32:23] God can satisfy those requests with one
[1:32:25] objective. To bring the individual to a
[1:32:28] place of settleness that God can bring
[1:32:31] them to a place of real rest in their
[1:32:34] life.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I believe that. Don't you?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't put God in a box.
[1:32:40] And I thank God for the example he gave
[1:32:42] us through the prophet in this in this
[1:32:44] end time. Now, so so notice he said
[1:32:46] you'd follow the Holy Spirit in divine
[1:32:48] love instead of sensations and little
[1:32:51] gifts and things like that. How much
[1:32:53] better off you'd be. God don't want you
[1:32:55] to run after gifts. He wants you to
[1:32:57] thirst after him.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just Yeah, there's no way
[1:33:03] I'm not going to get this done,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; but let me just let me just tap into
[1:33:07] this first part a little here.
[1:33:10] How that God's love, what a marvelous
[1:33:12] thing,
[1:33:15] that he would give his life for the
[1:33:18] unlovable,
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; and that the love of God would come down
[1:33:23] and and and through his working bring
[1:33:27] redemption in our lives and tabernacle
[1:33:30] himself in our life. The love of God
[1:33:33] through redeemed
[1:33:35] vessels.
[1:33:37] vessels that Paul said in the book of
[1:33:39] Titus. Our address was once hatred.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; It's what Paul said in Titus. We lived
[1:33:46] there
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; in hatred and malice and those types of
[1:33:50] things. That's where that's because
[1:33:51] that's where our first nature was tied.
[1:33:53] But look what the love of God has done
[1:33:56] upon our life. He lets you know who you
[1:33:58] are. Let you know the rights that belong
[1:34:00] to you. And through all of that, your
[1:34:02] life begin to yield. You begin to
[1:34:04] surrender. And look what he has done and
[1:34:07] is doing in your life right now. The
[1:34:10] love of God through redeemed vessels.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Lives that God that my goodness might
[1:34:18] have been the unreest
[1:34:22] always, you know, the, you know, big
[1:34:25] mouths and running everybody and this
[1:34:27] and that. And listen, God took John.
[1:34:30] John was a man that man, when things
[1:34:32] didn't go his way, he was ready to call
[1:34:34] fire down from heaven.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; He had scriptures, buddy. Shall we do
[1:34:38] like Elijah did? And Jesus turned to him
[1:34:42] and said, "You don't know what spirit
[1:34:43] you're of."
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; He never said that, John, you're you're
[1:34:48] not one of my disciples, but the spirit
[1:34:51] that was on him in that moment.
[1:34:58] But you read over and later on there was
[1:35:01] a change that came into John's life.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So notice Jesus said, "A new
[1:35:08] commandment I give you. That you love
[1:35:10] one another as I have loved you."
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; That ye also love one another. And by
[1:35:17] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:35:20] disciples. if you have love one to
[1:35:25] another.
[1:35:27] Now, I want you to think of this here
[1:35:29] for a moment because there's a great
[1:35:31] difference, brother Brandham. We'll
[1:35:33] we'll take this from the scriptures over
[1:35:35] and over between that. Remember when the
[1:35:38] conversation between Jesus and Peter,
[1:35:40] lovest thou me? And
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; and Peter could only respond according
[1:35:43] to the depth of love that he had
[1:35:45] experienced in his own life. I feel
[1:35:47] thee. But Jesus wasn't asking him, do
[1:35:48] you feel? He's asking, do you agape?
[1:35:50] Right?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; See, this is why you and I could not
[1:35:52] agape him that unconditional love. We
[1:35:56] couldn't do that without that love being
[1:35:58] imparted to us.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; See, we couldn't answer that. Now,
[1:36:03] listen to me now. Jesus, he said that
[1:36:05] you would love one another as I have
[1:36:07] loved you. As that's a tall task.
[1:36:11] That's a tall task.
[1:36:14] I want you to think about it. God who is
[1:36:16] perfect,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; holy, sinless, became one of us
[1:36:23] that he might experience all the things
[1:36:26] we go through, experience all the
[1:36:29] temptations.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; And not only that, Brother Brian, but
[1:36:33] his own disciples,
[1:36:35] here they are coming out of a good
[1:36:36] meeting and his own disciples are
[1:36:39] debating on who's going to be the
[1:36:40] greatest. Right.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; That's called being aggravated.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He was it show what was it that
[1:36:52] displayed itself? The love of God.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He was tempted to show himself forward.
[1:37:01] He was tempted among that of the
[1:37:02] disciples. And here they are and
[1:37:04] greatness and what they're looking at.
[1:37:06] And Jesus takes
[1:37:08] a little one. They they looked at this
[1:37:10] little one. And they said, "Come on, we
[1:37:13] don't got time for little things like
[1:37:15] this. We got to be talking about the
[1:37:17] deep things.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Without the little things,
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; the deep things don't have no power."
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; So he came brought a little child and
[1:37:31] said, "Except you become as that." Let
[1:37:32] me just say this. Jesus said through
[1:37:34] Paul, he said in ch in he said in malice
[1:37:38] be children but in men be understanding.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; So there's things that when we look at
[1:37:45] it with with the love of God, this is
[1:37:47] what even the maturing in our lives is
[1:37:50] coming into that of that capstone
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; of divine love. So God bringing us up
[1:37:58] into all of these things. Charity is
[1:38:01] always leading us upward when we're
[1:38:05] pursuing after that. And listen, let me
[1:38:07] just say this to you. Do you realize as
[1:38:08] I'm talking about this tonight and being
[1:38:10] pursuing after charity? Brother Aaron,
[1:38:12] this isn't something that you get around
[1:38:13] on the table and you sit down and you
[1:38:15] clench up your fist and I'm going to
[1:38:18] pursue after charity. I'm going to
[1:38:20] pursue after charity. I'm going to make
[1:38:23] uh this day this day is going to be a
[1:38:25] charity day.
[1:38:30] You know when you pursue after charity
[1:38:34] is when adversity strikes
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; and it begins to touch you. Certain
[1:38:41] things begin to touch just that feeling
[1:38:44] of love.
[1:38:45] certain things want to try to catch and
[1:38:47] and that's where you have to die more to
[1:38:50] self
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; letting the the the love of God come
[1:38:54] forth or as Paul wrote in Colossians and
[1:38:56] Ephesians putting on the new man sinking
[1:38:59] in to that garment
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; those are situations that we would like
[1:39:03] to escape from. We would like to escape
[1:39:05] offenses. We'd like to escape tests and
[1:39:08] try. We'd like to escape that, right?
[1:39:09] Everybody would. Let's just be honest.
[1:39:11] But God allows those things to come
[1:39:13] about for the purpose that charity might
[1:39:17] prevail in our life. Or even when you're
[1:39:20] prayed for and you're waiting on an
[1:39:23] answer,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; no answers come.
[1:39:27] Lord, it's one week from the surgery.
[1:39:31] Now, if you've made a condition as far
[1:39:34] as
[1:39:36] I am not going to go through this
[1:39:38] surgery, now if you've got a direct word
[1:39:41] from the Lord, you obey that word.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; But if you don't have a direct word from
[1:39:46] the Lord, you're only pursuing.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Because I want to remind you, healing
[1:39:51] itself is always a miracle.
[1:39:56] Can we take the words of the prophet
[1:39:58] believe in God preached in 1952 right
[1:40:00] over here in Erie Pennsylvania. God
[1:40:02] performs miracles through surgeries. God
[1:40:05] performs miracles through medicine. But
[1:40:07] see in our mind we prefer giving a
[1:40:10] testimony
[1:40:13] that oh this was going on but God healed
[1:40:17] me. And the church glory to God by the
[1:40:20] power of God.
[1:40:23] and somebody else goes to stand up and
[1:40:27] they figured, "Oh, no use to give my
[1:40:29] testimony. I've
[1:40:32] had to go through the surgery." And
[1:40:34] maybe somebody else sitting right in the
[1:40:35] congregation didn't even have to go
[1:40:37] through that surgery. You know what
[1:40:39] that's called? Sovereignty.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Did you hear me? That's called
[1:40:43] sovereignty. It's not called, "Oh, I
[1:40:46] mustered up so much faith and there was
[1:40:48] so You know what that's called? That's
[1:40:49] called bragging."
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; that's called pride. Right.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Homemade pride. There's some homemade
[1:40:55] recipes I like, but pride,
[1:40:58] that stuff is rancid. Oh, it will affect
[1:41:01] you. And man, I mean, it's one of those
[1:41:03] things at a church dinner, it can make
[1:41:04] everybody sick.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:41:15] loved you.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you, you know what? When
[1:41:18] we read it like that and look at it as I
[1:41:20] to the same degree, to the same measure,
[1:41:23] I can raise both of my hands and say,
[1:41:24] "Lord, I need help.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; I need more of you."
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; And the more of it is is I there's even
[1:41:33] more confession to come out of my life.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; So, this whole thing, let me let me just
[1:41:40] let me just leave you right here
[1:41:41] tonight. This is where this difference
[1:41:43] comes in
[1:41:46] between like and love.
[1:41:48] You see, among these disciples, they
[1:41:51] were as different as night was from day.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Remember, brother Ram tells us in things
[1:41:56] that ought to be, he said, if you tried
[1:41:58] to judge Peter by Andrew,
[1:42:01] you'd put one of them out.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Things that ought to be, he says, God's
[1:42:06] a God of variety, right? Our
[1:42:08] temperaments are different. Our
[1:42:10] personalities are different. And God
[1:42:13] said it that way, as he puts it in
[1:42:14] Ephesians 4. there. All those things are
[1:42:17] set differently. Now, just stay bear
[1:42:19] with me here just a moment and I'll
[1:42:21] close on this.
[1:42:23] There's individuals that God places here
[1:42:26] as we come together as a body. Oh, I
[1:42:29] know we think, man,
[1:42:32] I want everybody that I go to church
[1:42:33] with to be somebody that I like.
[1:42:38] I want to like everybody. Oh, brother
[1:42:40] Samuel, I do. Uh, be honest now. I'm not
[1:42:44] taking you out of that verse.
[1:42:46] But the love of God, even though
[1:42:49] personalities,
[1:42:52] differences in temperament, now listen
[1:42:54] to me.
[1:42:56] The love of God will not detest
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; an individual.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:03] may not like God never asked every one
[1:43:05] of us to be best buddies but neither did
[1:43:09] God give us a writing and say you know
[1:43:11] what you can be a part of this assembly
[1:43:13] go live on an island cuz you can't stand
[1:43:15] everybody else no God's got a remedy for
[1:43:18] not being able to stand everybody else
[1:43:19] it's called the Holy Ghost
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; it's called the love of God
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; that'll actually push through your life
[1:43:25] and to where that you look beyond their
[1:43:28] temperament you look beyond their
[1:43:30] personality that's what the love of God
[1:43:33] did for you and I. It looked beyond our
[1:43:36] unlovableness. It looked beyond our
[1:43:38] temperament. It looked beyond all of
[1:43:40] that and looked beyond that. And the
[1:43:43] love of God was projected to you and I.
[1:43:46] So God never ever ever set it up that
[1:43:50] all of a sudden we'd all be gathered
[1:43:51] together. And man, to really express
[1:43:54] divine love, it's got to be everybody's
[1:43:57] personality that I like.
[1:44:01] Well, there wouldn't be no test and
[1:44:04] proving grounds
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; for divine love.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; But God knows the proving grounds we
[1:44:11] need.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And let me say this to you as well.
[1:44:16] Within these proving grounds, let's
[1:44:19] stand. I'm not going to keep going.
[1:44:21] Within these proving grounds, we're
[1:44:23] tried. Right?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Are you going to continue to be around
[1:44:27] only those that you like
[1:44:32] fellowship dinners?
[1:44:36] Lord, maybe we should start putting out
[1:44:38] numbers.
[1:44:42] Oh, brother Samuel, that that wouldn't
[1:44:44] be really. How many how many quotes? How
[1:44:46] many quotes? Brother Bram talks about
[1:44:48] you've been around people. Oh, you just
[1:44:50] love to be around the atmosphere. Then
[1:44:52] he said, there's others. Is that right?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me, Brother Bram. In every
[1:44:56] one of those quotes, Brother Ram's not
[1:44:57] talking about well somebody's born again
[1:44:58] or somebody's not born again. That's not
[1:45:00] what he's talking about.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; There are differences that are among us.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; How many times Brother Bram says, "My my
[1:45:07] brother likes apple pie and I like
[1:45:09] cherry." I like both. I like both with
[1:45:11] some good good vanilla green ice cream.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Right. I might I mean I love apple
[1:45:15] crisp. I'll take apple crisp any day of
[1:45:17] the week over chocolate cake or anything
[1:45:19] else. Now, you might look at that and
[1:45:21] say, "No, I'd rather have this or I'd
[1:45:23] rather have that." That's differences.
[1:45:24] But you see how the spirit of God listen
[1:45:27] why didn't if God wanted it to be I'll
[1:45:29] tell you what I'll tell you what you you
[1:45:31] know what let's just let's go interview
[1:45:32] a church. You take your clipboard and
[1:45:35] you go interview a church and let's just
[1:45:36] see how much it meets your criteria and
[1:45:39] see. I'll guarantee you within every
[1:45:41] assembly God has all the differences.
[1:45:44] Why would God do it that way? Perfect
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; because of the opportunity
[1:45:52] for divine love to come to perfection
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; in our lives
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; to where there is a group of people that
[1:46:01] even though maybe our personalities and
[1:46:03] temperaments are as different from night
[1:46:05] to day but that is not the focus. Are
[1:46:07] you hearing me?
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; It's not becomes the focus. Oh, I tell
[1:46:10] you that person's personality. Well,
[1:46:12] your personality may be like that
[1:46:13] towards them.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; But I think all of our personalities
[1:46:16] need sweetening of the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It don't matter. We
[1:46:20] might we have our differences, but it's
[1:46:21] to understand that very thing. So, I'm
[1:46:23] not trying the Holy Spirit. The Holy
[1:46:25] Spirit never came here to all of a
[1:46:27] sudden make Sister Naomi's personality
[1:46:29] just like Sister Brownings or Sister
[1:46:31] Caroline. That's not what God came to
[1:46:33] do. The Holy Ghost don't do that.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; That's not So, if if somehow we're
[1:46:37] thinking that, we're thinking wrong.
[1:46:39] That's right. That's right.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you, when the Holy Ghost
[1:46:41] comes, I'm going to keep house like so
[1:46:42] and so. No, you'll still have to make
[1:46:44] decisions about how you keep house.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost don't come in your life
[1:46:49] and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit
[1:46:51] makes you my I can work with my hands
[1:46:53] like brother Aaron. I can man go right
[1:46:55] through there and schedule. I can do
[1:46:57] that. My I can put drywall like brother
[1:46:59] Carlos. You are crazy. That's not what
[1:47:03] the Holy Ghost come to do.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; No. But the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:08] he comes in your life
[1:47:11] to change your life and to reflect his
[1:47:14] will through your life.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And that's a choice that we make.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; I pray God help us.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; God give us grace. If there's one thing,
[1:47:26] friends, I believe that we could use as
[1:47:28] an assembly is a real rededication.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; I believe that a real pursuing in the
[1:47:34] right things. Lord, help me. Help me to
[1:47:35] help me to go beyond that. We don't want
[1:47:37] just our own little boundaries on
[1:47:39] things.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; We want to go beyond. Friends, I listen.
[1:47:41] I'm not trying to push you into
[1:47:43] anything. I'm not trying to project. I'm
[1:47:45] just trying to say that you're not going
[1:47:47] to have your own little click in heaven.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have your own little
[1:47:53] pod. Let me just tell you something.
[1:47:54] What heaven's going to be, it's going to
[1:47:56] be where all of those things that have
[1:47:59] been our button pushers and unlikes and
[1:48:02] personalities, let me just tell you
[1:48:03] something. yours will be changed, too.
[1:48:06] This is why we need more than just to be
[1:48:08] young people again. Because if we were
[1:48:10] young people again, we'd be in the same
[1:48:11] mess we are right now. That's why the
[1:48:13] rapture is a promise of a change
[1:48:16] completely.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; But remember what the rapture is. It's
[1:48:21] character
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; that has come to a place of harvesting
[1:48:25] in our life. And the prophet said it'll
[1:48:29] be a transplanting
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; in that new body.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; That right in this this vessel
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; that once hatred was common
[1:48:41] things somebody does me wrong. I never
[1:48:44] forget that man. I mark that down. Got
[1:48:47] this offense that offense that offense
[1:48:49] tally this offense that offense. This is
[1:48:51] where we live because that that's what
[1:48:52] this is made up of.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. Remember when the prince
[1:48:55] of God got thick down in the garden of
[1:48:57] Eden? Oh my, think about it. Adam was
[1:49:01] willing to stand out there and he was
[1:49:02] willing to take his bride and take her
[1:49:06] to himself. But as the prince of God got
[1:49:09] very got real thick, it showed up the
[1:49:13] condition even that he had become in. He
[1:49:15] said, "Lord,
[1:49:17] the woman you gave me,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; wow, how things changed.
[1:49:24] But you know why that changed? Because
[1:49:27] Adam separated himself from divine love
[1:49:33] to be united with his wife.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And that's where
[1:49:40] that very thing come from. You know how
[1:49:42] it happens when you can't overlook one
[1:49:44] another's faults and mistakes? You know
[1:49:46] what the prophet said? He said, "You've
[1:49:48] separated from divine love." Not divine
[1:49:51] love separated from you. you separated
[1:49:53] from it. I say, "Oh God,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; we want to pursue the right things."
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Pursuing the right thing.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:50:05] Lord, how we thank you for your mercy
[1:50:07] this evening. Our hearts, Lord, I Oh
[1:50:11] God, our hearts are challenged, Lord.
[1:50:15] Lord Jesus, help us, Lord. I pray this
[1:50:19] Lord great achievement Lord that you
[1:50:22] will bring to pass
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; you are bringing to pass in our lives
[1:50:27] Lord how it becomes so
[1:50:30] becomes so apparent
[1:50:34] I can do nothing
[1:50:38] without you Lord
[1:50:40] there's no way Lord that your prophet
[1:50:42] would even talk about what took place
[1:50:45] with the bull the maniac and other
[1:50:47] things.
[1:50:48] He said,
[1:50:51] "It's not something that can be mentally
[1:50:53] worked up,
[1:50:55] but he said it in these words." He said,
[1:50:58] "It's something that God
[1:51:01] has to give.
[1:51:03] It's sovereign."
[1:51:06] Lord,
[1:51:08] I believe we can go to you tonight and
[1:51:10] we can see our needs
[1:51:14] and we can look to you, Lord, as
[1:51:16] sovereign God. Maybe there's a
[1:51:18] situation, maybe there's a need in our
[1:51:20] life. Maybe there's something, Lord,
[1:51:23] that Father, you would bring to our
[1:51:26] attention and we realize we we can't go
[1:51:29] any further until we get that resolved.
[1:51:32] I believe Lord that the love of God is
[1:51:36] here cuz your desire
[1:51:40] is for us Lord
[1:51:42] to press onward and upward.
[1:51:47] Help us Lord.
[1:51:50] I pray father if there's one here under
[1:51:52] the sound of my voice or would be
[1:51:54] streaming this service
[1:51:56] Lord God has not received that of the
[1:52:00] love of God in their soul.
[1:52:04] Lord they've experienced your love
[1:52:06] breaking over upon their spirit and my
[1:52:09] how Lord in their mind it would just
[1:52:12] Lord God so seem to satiate.
[1:52:16] But just after some time out from your
[1:52:19] presence,
[1:52:22] they find the same things in their life
[1:52:24] that was before.
[1:52:26] Lord God, I pray tonight.
[1:52:29] May they just Lord look to you and say,
[1:52:31] "Father,
[1:52:33] I want to go to that fountain
[1:52:36] that Lord God, the same one that Oh my
[1:52:39] Lord, it's been wonderful service after
[1:52:41] service, but Lord God, I want the
[1:52:43] satisfier down on the inside of my soul.
[1:52:47] I want that seal of the spirit of God,
[1:52:50] the love of God that even when I don't
[1:52:53] understand
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:56] when situations arrive, friends forsake
[1:52:59] me,
[1:53:01] that there's a love that holds me. When
[1:53:04] temptation comes my way
[1:53:07] and my flesh is pulled, my mind is
[1:53:10] pulled.
[1:53:12] Oh God, the love of God
[1:53:16] holds.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Lord God, grant it tonight. Lord, I
[1:53:22] believe, Lord God, that this is a
[1:53:24] special service. It's special because
[1:53:26] you've called it and you're here. That's
[1:53:29] what makes every service special. Yes.
[1:53:31] Amen.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; And we've gathered here as your
[1:53:34] children, Lord, to worship you, to hear
[1:53:36] from your word,
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:39] as you brought through Brother Isaac on
[1:53:40] Sunday to look and live. Look beyond
[1:53:43] conditions. Look beyond circumstances.
[1:53:46] Look beyond defenses. Look beyond all of
[1:53:49] these things and look away to Jesus.
[1:53:52] Lord God,
[1:53:54] oh the love of God, what greater power.
[1:53:57] As your prophet said, there's not a
[1:53:58] stronger force upon the earth.
[1:54:02] How the love of God,
[1:54:05] Lord Jesus,
[1:54:08] help us, Lord, as a body,
[1:54:11] as a local body, Lord God, even Lord
[1:54:14] God, in the larger scale, as a bride
[1:54:16] body, help us Lord, for truly the love
[1:54:21] of God,
[1:54:23] Lord Jesus, we need more, Lord.
[1:54:26] In reality, Lord God, we need less of
[1:54:29] ourselves.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we could pursue after a lot of
[1:54:35] things in this life.
[1:54:39] Lord, Paul would write to the
[1:54:40] Corinthians and your prophet would pick
[1:54:42] it up over and over clear to the closing
[1:54:46] messages
[1:54:48] and admonish
[1:54:50] us as believers.
[1:54:52] He would say in the message of prisoner,
[1:54:55] do not judge your life
[1:54:58] by miracles or supernatural happenings,
[1:55:03] but always judge your life
[1:55:07] by how much of the fruit of the spirit
[1:55:11] is being expressed through your life.
[1:55:15] Help us Lord. Help us Lord.
[1:55:19] Dear God, this is a a task that you've
[1:55:22] laid out that there's absolutely no way
[1:55:25] that a human is able to do this in our
[1:55:28] own capacity.
[1:55:31] It can be nothing more than divine love.

[1:55:39] through the Thessalon church,
[1:55:41] Philippians, Colossians, on and on of
[1:55:43] how that their love
[1:55:46] would abound, grow, increase.

[1:56:15] Lord God, till one day, one moment when
[1:56:20] that capstone Lord itself sets down and
[1:56:22] then the body is lifted out of here.
[1:56:26] It'll be the climax
[1:56:29] to the working of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:32] bringing sons and daughters into full
[1:56:35] adoption.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Oh God, the adoption is working in our
[1:56:40] lives right now. The spirit of adoption
[1:56:42] to bring us Lord to that place.
