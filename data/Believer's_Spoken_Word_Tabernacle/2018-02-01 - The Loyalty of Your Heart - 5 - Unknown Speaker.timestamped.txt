[38:36] perfection father we love you and we
[38:39] thank you tonight the name of the Lord
[38:42] Jesus Christ
[38:45] god bless you tonight you would have
[38:48] your Bibles let's go to first Peter
[38:49] chapter 1 verse 3 there's Peter chapter
[38:56] 1 verse 3 a few verses of Scripture here
[39:12] where's Peter chapter 1 verse 3 does
[39:15] blessed be the God and father of our
[39:18] Lord Jesus Christ which according to his
[39:21] abundant mercy has begotten us again
[39:24] unto a lively hope by the resurrection
[39:27] of Jesus Christ from the dead to an
[39:30] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[39:34] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[39:38] for you who are kept by the power of God
[39:44] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[39:49] revealed in the last time look at this
[39:53] in verse 6 wherein ye greatly rejoice we
[39:59] have something to rejoice about not what
[40:03] is just past but what we because of what
[40:06] God has done and made real in our lives
[40:08] we have a true home a true expectation
[40:12] so this is what we rejoice in this is
[40:15] wearing that as Peter said we greatly
[40:18] rejoice though now for a season if need
[40:23] be who determines if it needs me he does
[40:29] though now for a season if need be ye
[40:34] are in heaviness through manifold
[40:37] temptation sorrowful sad through many
[40:42] variegated ways things can come in it at
[40:48] the trial verse 7 of your faith being
[40:52] much more precious than of gold that
[40:56] perishing you know as if we were
[40:59] offering tonight would you rather have a
[41:00] trial of gold
[41:04] I'm sure if I'm sure they would pearl
[41:06] appeared but you don't know the
[41:08] circumstance for the sin no but here
[41:10] when we look at it through the eyes of
[41:13] God the trial itself is worth more than
[41:17] pure
[41:20] the trial is the trial is worth more
[41:25] than pure gold being much more precious
[41:30] than a gold that perishes though it be
[41:33] tried with fire might be found unto
[41:36] praise and honor and glory at the
[41:39] appearing of Jesus Christ whom having
[41:44] not seen ye love in whom though now you
[41:48] see him not yet believing you rejoice
[41:51] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[41:56] receiving the end of your faith even the
[42:01] salvation of your soul amen
[42:06] may God bless you bless the reading of
[42:08] his word tonight may be seated we want
[42:12] to continue to look at that the loyalty
[42:14] of your heart and remembering as the
[42:21] Prophet where we've been bringing that
[42:23] from three kinds of believers and how
[42:26] that he would remind us that the loyalty
[42:30] of our heart beats the material just
[42:34] she's ready to go into the mall if it
[42:38] was not for the loyalty of our heart we
[42:42] would have been gone a long time ago not
[42:45] not the loyalty not our our will not not
[42:48] our resiliency the loyalty is his life
[42:53] pulsating through us so it's not us in
[42:56] our strength it's him that's the loyalty
[43:00] of heart it's not our humanists you know
[43:03] you can look at many times a great
[43:05] resiliency I've had things sometimes
[43:07] said and heard where if this individual
[43:10] begins serving the Lord I'll tell you
[43:11] what you don't have know you I tell you
[43:13] what you'll see an individual they'll
[43:14] never turn back they'll never give up
[43:16] that is true if God steps into the midst
[43:20] of that life without God I don't care
[43:24] they may have been so dedicated within
[43:26] things you may have to literally about
[43:28] beat them to death to stop them from
[43:29] going to work
[43:30] you might be able to have to do all
[43:32] these other things they have such a
[43:33] resiliency about themselves maybe it's a
[43:35] problem that a lot of times that they
[43:37] will go and go and go and try to solve
[43:39] that problem but yet all of that is
[43:42] human
[43:42] resiliency or it is natural nature given
[43:46] virtues that are very precious and we we
[43:48] thank God for that but unless those
[43:50] things are truly birth in us by the
[43:53] Spirit of God and there is a typos to
[43:56] keeping power by the love of God shed
[43:59] abroad in our hearts then there's no
[44:01] staying power
[44:03] so the loyalty of heart comes by a life
[44:06] that's actually been quickened by the
[44:08] Spirit of Almighty God it's a love
[44:11] affair we're not we're not here tonight
[44:13] because we're in fear we're not serving
[44:16] the Lord tonight of fear and will I may
[44:18] fall tomorrow know if you've been born
[44:20] at the Spirit of God you cannot fail God
[44:23] can't fail you can't fail because when
[44:26] God has done a work in your life whereby
[44:28] that you are sealed by the Spirit of God
[44:30] you cannot turn back there's nowhere to
[44:33] turn back to all bridges have been burnt
[44:36] you say brother Sam are you preaching
[44:38] that awful high I'm preaching about a
[44:40] personal experience is that right it's
[44:43] just like what I've talked about before
[44:44] when you can talk about nyquil I can
[44:47] talk about nyquil but somebody else
[44:48] might talk about it just by reading the
[44:50] label but you only know it if you tried
[44:52] it yourself
[44:53] and know what it's capable of doing I'm
[44:56] not advising you to go out and get
[44:57] nyquil but you understand what I'm
[44:59] saying it's my experience in our life
[45:01] that the reality is it's just like the
[45:03] song that brother Paul was wrote he
[45:06] wrote my inspiration something keeps
[45:08] holding me even within the midst of that
[45:10] song it was nothing about the humanists
[45:13] of the individual it was about the
[45:14] greatness of the anchor of Almighty God
[45:17] so we all understand that within our
[45:19] life if there's any glorying here
[45:21] tonight the real true glory is to be
[45:24] upon him it's him that has given us the
[45:27] strength to be here tonight and to live
[45:29] a victorious life to even be able to
[45:32] overcome through the darkness of trials
[45:34] that you have been through it is by His
[45:36] grace his love that would dwell in our
[45:39] hearts so we find that within this you
[45:42] know how that
[45:43] many times like satan did to JoVE and
[45:46] many times who come at us in this way to
[45:49] try to make us think when we're going
[45:51] when something we're going through that
[45:53] as though that it's God punishing us or
[45:55] it's some somehow you know that that God
[45:58] is so upset with us or displeased with
[46:01] us but when we come into that place and
[46:04] know that you know in our lives because
[46:06] there's things that you and I both know
[46:08] there's things sometimes that we cannot
[46:09] classify as trials we cannot classify as
[46:12] tests it's our own ignorance that's got
[46:15] us in some of the message that we've got
[46:16] into we can't claim it and say well
[46:18] bless God I'm suffering for the calls of
[46:20] the Lord and there's many times that
[46:22] that is true and then there's other
[46:23] times it's our own ignorance it's our
[46:26] own things that brings it on and within
[46:28] that right there there is a learning we
[46:30] can grow from that right there if we'll
[46:32] allow God to be able to direct us and
[46:35] not try to shift it off on somebody else
[46:37] or this or that but be able to say lord
[46:39] help me right now in this area Lord this
[46:42] is obviously a part that's a little week
[46:44] in my life but make me strong Lord pour
[46:47] yourself in to that area of my life so
[46:50] when we look at this we know that as God
[46:53] made this known to job that he made
[46:56] known to job that it wasn't that Satan
[46:59] was it wasn't God doing it but it was
[47:01] Satan doing it and God was permitting it
[47:04] to take place because he was gonna make
[47:07] something out of juvie and we come into
[47:09] our scripture tonight and how that Peter
[47:11] would speak to us that he has begotten
[47:14] unto us and begotten us unto a lively
[47:16] hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[47:18] from the dead to an inheritance
[47:20] incorruptible that which is a body
[47:24] that's reserved in the heavens that
[47:26] which was already there and that that's
[47:29] reserved for you and I it's there when
[47:32] we leave this life that we would go into
[47:35] that body that is already prepared for
[47:37] us when the scripture would even speak
[47:40] of that of being seated in heavenly
[47:42] places we realized that we have a
[47:44] representative before the throne of God
[47:47] that representative has always been
[47:49] there but you and I come to a place of
[47:51] recognizing of who we are and that we do
[47:54] have representation
[47:56] they're already so when we're looking at
[47:59] this here we are that's already reserved
[48:01] there are inheritance of where we are
[48:04] going to we've received a down pallet or
[48:06] a deposit or a down payment by the
[48:08] baptism of the holy ghost in our soul
[48:10] that makes us aware that we have a body
[48:13] that's waiting over there but here we
[48:16] are in this body of time that we're
[48:19] dwelling in and we realize that this is
[48:22] all for a purpose that we are where
[48:25] we're going but yet as Peter would say
[48:27] we're greatly rejoicing in what of what
[48:30] awaits us and what we have to look
[48:32] forward to and yet right now if need be
[48:36] for a season we're in there heaviness
[48:40] great sorrow and sadness there's no one
[48:46] of us in here and I say us that's ever
[48:49] been happy in the midst as far as saying
[48:51] I'm so happy for this trial there's not
[48:55] one of us but the reality is more now
[48:58] listen to me the more has God is
[49:01] bringing his word to our hearts what is
[49:04] it doing it's maturing us as we allow
[49:07] the word to have its way in our life to
[49:09] where when these things come about that
[49:11] we're able to look back and allow the
[49:13] Spirit of God to bring this to our mind
[49:16] to where that you and I are settled to
[49:19] allow God and say Lord I don't
[49:20] understand what's going on I don't know
[49:23] what's working out here but I know this
[49:25] one thing that my destiny is sure I know
[49:28] one thing that is sure I know where I'm
[49:30] doing I know where I come from I don't
[49:32] know what is all going on right here but
[49:35] you know what you're doing and even
[49:38] though that I would not have signed up
[49:39] for this trial but you seen it was me be
[49:43] you seen that it was need be so within
[49:47] it the Prophet takes it like this and
[49:49] who is this milk esident when a man is
[49:51] born again from heaven he becomes a
[49:54] spirit babe in Christ and when this robe
[49:57] of flesh is dropped there is a natural
[50:00] body of theophany a body not made with
[50:03] hands neither born of a woman that we go
[50:05] to then that body returns back and picks
[50:08] up the glorified
[50:10] that's the reason Jesus went to hell
[50:12] when he died and preached to the souls
[50:14] that were in prison he turned back into
[50:17] the orphan II oh how marvelous think God
[50:20] in 2nd Corinthians 5:1
[50:22] if this earthly body be dissolved this
[50:26] earthly Tabernacle we have another one
[50:29] see we have bypassed that to come
[50:33] straight from God the attribute to be
[50:36] flesh to be tempted and tested by sin
[50:39] like Adam did but when testing of his
[50:44] word is over Gorillaz that's what we're
[50:47] tested born is his word because as as
[50:52] tests and trials are permitted the enemy
[50:54] always has some sort of a voice that he
[50:57] wants to try to say concerning their
[50:59] trial the prophet have just heard it
[51:02] this morning of possessing the enemy's
[51:03] gate after trial he said in every part
[51:05] in Abraham's life he said the enemy was
[51:08] right there to talk to him of regarding
[51:10] the trials he went through the enemy is
[51:13] always there he don't all of a sudden
[51:15] back off he don't back off because while
[51:17] they've been walking in the message for
[51:19] this man here he don't back off as a
[51:21] matter of fact you could have whooped
[51:22] that guy a black and designed everything
[51:24] he'll be right back at the door tomorrow
[51:27] morning o people could only be that
[51:30] faithful we don't want to be Devils but
[51:34] the devil is always there is that right
[51:36] the devil never misses church the devil
[51:41] never misses an opportunity listen
[51:43] that guy's ready when you wake up a
[51:45] morning bound to hit you he's ready he
[51:48] tries to make use of every opportunity
[51:51] to try to do what break your confidence
[51:59] hallelujah
[52:00] but when testing of this of his word is
[52:03] over then we are taken up to this body
[52:07] that was prepared for us before the
[52:09] foundation of the world it is the word
[52:11] there that we skip to come right around
[52:14] and down here to be tempted and testing
[52:19] if we'd have come through that there
[52:22] have been no Tim
[52:23] we denote all things that's the reason
[52:25] Jesus known all things he was he was the
[52:27] word before he was flesh then we become
[52:30] the word now watch what he says here
[52:32] here we are formed to the word image see
[52:37] there's a forming in our life that
[52:39] reflects that other world that we are a
[52:41] part of we are being formed to the word
[52:45] image not our flesh but being formed to
[52:49] the word image that likeness that
[52:51] reflection I think of how the Prophet
[52:53] would place it in God in simplicity in
[52:55] jeffersonville when he says let us so
[52:58] characterize and live our lives now as
[53:01] if we were already in that other city
[53:04] let us let us characterize our lives now
[53:09] and live as though we were already there
[53:12] here we are formed to the word image to
[53:15] be a partaker of the word feed on the
[53:19] word
[53:19] by being predestinated since the
[53:22] beginning you know you are ordained to
[53:23] this diet of the word the other things
[53:27] you tried to eat it just would not
[53:29] satisfy you could heat it it would leave
[53:32] you empty but there's something about
[53:35] the word it's because you and I were a
[53:37] part of that word it it has a satisfying
[53:40] part you begin to partake of the word
[53:42] and and the words coming from I that
[53:45] just sounds like something I I just I
[53:47] really love that I it some things are
[53:49] making sense and what is that it's God
[53:51] Himself wooing and drawing on our life
[53:54] you're partaking of it and then
[53:55] eventually as you become a feeder on the
[53:59] word itself what are you feeding you are
[54:02] feeding on that diet of the word and
[54:04] what's it doing it is forming you into
[54:07] the word image the feeding all together
[54:09] does not form you and I but the feeding
[54:11] gives us the nutrients and the strength
[54:13] that in the formation process we are
[54:16] able to be able to yield ourselves to
[54:19] him Alleluia by being predestinated
[54:25] since the beginning you see that little
[54:26] spark of life that you had on you from
[54:28] the beginning when you started your
[54:30] journey he said many of you can remember
[54:32] it you join this church and join that
[54:34] church you tried this and that
[54:36] nothing satisfied but one day you just
[54:40] recognized it in Hebrews 10 verse 32
[54:46] Paul's have been called to remembrance
[54:48] the former days in which after ye were
[54:54] illuminated he endured a great fight
[54:58] that word fight means combative hard
[55:01] trials contested he endured a great
[55:04] fight of afflictions when after you were
[55:10] illuminated enlightened made to shine
[55:13] something that was there as it would say
[55:15] in the Greek something that was there
[55:17] now brought forth in light after you
[55:21] were illuminated so now you're new can't
[55:24] blend in you stand out what's made you
[55:27] stand out light you've been illuminated
[55:31] you've been lit up and one time blending
[55:35] in but now it's lit up
[55:37] you didn't light it God let you up but
[55:42] there was something there that could be
[55:44] ignited for glory he didn't ignite our
[55:47] flesh that will wear out
[55:49] he didn't ignite our spirit battle we're
[55:52] out on a windy day panel blowout but he
[55:54] ignited our soul he immersed us in the
[55:58] divine oil of His Holy Spirit and he set
[56:01] us on fire here we are in between the
[56:04] oil in between the fire but devil cannot
[56:07] get you out of there
[56:08] you've been illuminated by Almighty God
[56:12] amen where you drawn your strip to be
[56:15] illuminated from from the oil your roots
[56:18] are in the oil your wit is in the oil
[56:24] after you were illuminated you endured a
[56:27] great fight of afflictions partly whiles
[56:32] you were made of gazing stock brought on
[56:34] stage both by reproaches suffering and
[56:39] afflictions and partly while you became
[56:42] companions of them that were so used so
[56:47] you become part of something
[56:51] you became on stage now is your time
[56:54] your part your role has been called to
[56:57] be acted out it's time to act your part
[57:01] out but thank God that we're not acting
[57:03] on our own strength thank god there's
[57:06] one who is present to act in you and I
[57:09] but the only thing he needs to do is us
[57:12] to yield and then he can act out the
[57:14] exact character or the characterization
[57:17] of the word that's supposed to be aren't
[57:19] you glad now let's take a little trip
[57:22] again here tonight then we're gonna
[57:24] maybe put our hard hats on here for a
[57:26] little bit more and we're gonna deal
[57:28] with certain things a little bit more
[57:29] with steel because I know some of you
[57:31] here you're aware of this already but I
[57:33] got to really just thinking upon my
[57:35] heart the thought just dropped in my
[57:36] heart when that which is actually
[57:38] brought forth the steel and the iron and
[57:41] those things right there what process
[57:43] itself must it go through before it can
[57:46] ever be tempered that bethe thought they
[57:49] just dropped on my heart I said Lord
[57:50] well let me go look and let's see what
[57:52] that is so let's take a look tonight in
[57:56] the metal hardening and I know some of
[57:58] these words will be beyond our head but
[58:00] we'll try to make them simple here
[58:01] tonight the use of this treatment in
[58:03] metal hardening will resort or result in
[58:07] an improvement of the mechanical
[58:08] properties as well as an increase in the
[58:11] level of hardness producing a tougher
[58:13] more durable item alloys are heated
[58:17] above the critical transformation
[58:20] temperature for the material then cooled
[58:23] rapidly enough to cause the soft initial
[58:26] material to transform to a much harder
[58:30] stronger structure so there needs to be
[58:34] a transformation first a transformation
[58:38] from the soft material that's there
[58:41] there must be a transformation and it
[58:45] takes the critical transformation
[58:48] temperature aren't you glad that God
[58:51] knows the temperature in May aren't you
[58:54] glad he didn't reduce the temperature in
[58:55] this age it's the same temperature the
[58:58] same critical transformation temperature
[59:01] that was given on the
[59:03] Pinnacle's it's the same transforming
[59:06] temperature that comes down and brings
[59:09] transformation alloys may be air cooled
[59:13] or cooled by quenching in oil water or
[59:15] another liquid depending upon the amount
[59:17] of alloying elements and the material
[59:19] harden materials are usually tempered or
[59:22] stress relief to improve their
[59:25] dimensional stability and toughness
[59:26] steel parts often require a heat
[59:30] treatment to obtain improved mechanical
[59:33] properties such as increasing hardness
[59:36] increased hardness or strength the
[59:39] hardening process consists of he Denis
[59:42] of heating the components above the
[59:44] critical normalizing temperature holding
[59:47] at this temperature for 1 hour per inch
[59:49] of thickness cooling had a rate fast
[59:52] enough to allow the material to
[59:55] transform to a much harder stronger
[59:58] structure and then tempering
[1:00:03] so there's a process before temporary
[1:00:06] what we're reading about here tonight is
[1:00:09] tempering but there is a process that
[1:00:11] you must go through that will make you
[1:00:13] temporal there's a process that we have
[1:00:17] been brought into whereby that we can
[1:00:20] actually be tempered in this process is
[1:00:22] where that there is developed a hardness
[1:00:25] not a hardness of hard what what a
[1:00:28] contrasting what a contrasting thought
[1:00:30] in one way it's not a hardness of heart
[1:00:32] but it's a steadfastness of his faith in
[1:00:36] our life by real personal experience oh
[1:00:40] my notice it goes on to say steel is
[1:00:46] essentially an alloy of iron and carbon
[1:00:49] other steel alloys have other metal
[1:00:52] elements in solution heating the
[1:00:54] material above the critical temperature
[1:00:56] causes carbon and the other elements to
[1:00:58] go into solid solution quenching freezes
[1:01:03] the microstructure inducing
[1:01:04] stresses parts are subsequently tempered
[1:01:07] to transform the microstructure and
[1:01:09] achieve the appropriate hardness and
[1:01:12] eliminate the stresses
[1:01:15] so there's before there's a tempering
[1:01:18] there's got to be a quenching but when a
[1:01:21] quenching has happened a hardening for
[1:01:24] for this material then it's ready to go
[1:01:27] into the tempering stage but in the
[1:01:30] quenching part when the material is
[1:01:32] actually quenched as we read here there
[1:01:35] is actually there is a micro structure
[1:01:37] where stresses are induced let me tell
[1:01:39] you this right here before you and I
[1:01:42] were born of the Spirit of God we could
[1:01:44] slap along and everything else but once
[1:01:46] you have been born of the Spirit of God
[1:01:48] you no longer are just a one part being
[1:01:50] you have become a two part being a man
[1:01:53] in your soul dwells the very deity of
[1:01:56] Almighty God and yet out here in your
[1:01:59] body now comes in the great ruling force
[1:02:02] at one time you were ruled by the Prince
[1:02:04] and power of the air and one time you
[1:02:06] were under its subjection but now you
[1:02:08] have received of the divine authority by
[1:02:11] the indwelling of his Spirit whereby you
[1:02:13] can mortify the deeds of the body you
[1:02:17] can make your body obey the Word of God
[1:02:19] by what by that power that is laying
[1:02:23] within you oh there are stresses that
[1:02:26] are there where at one time there was no
[1:02:28] war the one day the Prophet said when
[1:02:31] you have been born in the Spirit of God
[1:02:33] you're in a constant war from that time
[1:02:35] on constant war we're not in my soul but
[1:02:39] a constant war there stresses us there
[1:02:42] why this is what God could say I'll give
[1:02:44] you a new heart a new spirit and I will
[1:02:47] put my spirit in you and cause you to
[1:02:51] keep my ways but God knows how to reduce
[1:02:58] the stresses once he's got us quenched
[1:03:02] then it's time for tempering anybody
[1:03:07] want to sign up for tempering metal
[1:03:15] quenching let's look at that quenching a
[1:03:17] little bit more material is heated up to
[1:03:20] the suitable temperature and then
[1:03:22] quenched in water or oil to harden to
[1:03:26] full hardness according to the Chi
[1:03:28] materials so it's a two-step process
[1:03:30] it's got to be heated to a certain spot
[1:03:33] and then it's quenched in the water or
[1:03:39] the oil well in our case water and oil
[1:03:43] represents the holy spirit it's the same
[1:03:52] God it's the same one that what's it
[1:03:54] done moving up on a lot getting our
[1:03:56] lives in the heat my the heat of the
[1:03:58] word here you come and you're hearing
[1:03:59] the word and my the heat of the word
[1:04:01] just coming you know what I don't need
[1:04:03] to live this way no more
[1:04:04] I want to serve Almighty God what's he
[1:04:07] doing he's heating you up he's heating
[1:04:09] you up he's warming you up what's he
[1:04:11] doing drawing you unto himself it's a
[1:04:14] whole part of the quenching process but
[1:04:16] after warming you up and getting you to
[1:04:19] that critical point to where there's
[1:04:20] nothing else that matters in your life
[1:04:23] then he says it's ready for the solution
[1:04:29] hallelujah material is heated to the
[1:04:31] suitable temperature for hardening then
[1:04:33] cooled rapidly by immersing the hot part
[1:04:37] in water oil or another suitable liquid
[1:04:39] to transform the material to a fully
[1:04:43] hardened structure so just being warmed
[1:04:47] up it's not the quenching process but
[1:04:50] part of the quenching process is being
[1:04:52] warmed up to a place then it's ready to
[1:04:57] go in the oil or the water parts which
[1:05:02] are quenched Omaha usually must be aged
[1:05:08] tempered or stress relieved to achieve
[1:05:12] the proper toughness final hardness and
[1:05:17] dimensional stability Lori you're no
[1:05:23] longer just we would say as though just
[1:05:26] aware of this dimension you become aware
[1:05:30] of another dimension you believe that
[1:05:33] the prophet of God tells us that nough
[1:05:36] in the Patmos vision he said I want you
[1:05:37] to watch John being a spirit-filled man
[1:05:40] and because she was spirit filled
[1:05:42] the angel that was sent to him could
[1:05:44] come and talk to him he said see when
[1:05:46] you have been born of the Spirit of God
[1:05:47] you're no longer just a one part being
[1:05:50] you become a twofold being and the
[1:05:52] supernatural God is able to send His
[1:05:55] angels to you and talk to you because
[1:05:58] you believe what they're saying you're
[1:06:03] no longer just living in this world it
[1:06:05] becomes like the Lord Jesus I am in this
[1:06:08] world but I'm not of this world
[1:06:13] glory be to God so you've been heated to
[1:06:17] a certain spot kind of like taking
[1:06:20] cucumbers and heating them up to a
[1:06:21] certain spot you heat him up to a
[1:06:24] certain spot boiling water but you just
[1:06:30] don't want to heat up and eat hot
[1:06:31] cucumbers it's the objective isn't to
[1:06:34] heat him up just to heat him up but the
[1:06:36] objective is is to make pickles out of
[1:06:39] so you'll heat them up in that boiling
[1:06:41] water till a certain spot and then they
[1:06:45] go in the vinegar solution then they're
[1:06:48] quenched
[1:06:48] or I can say satisfied they don't want
[1:06:53] no more of the world are you with me
[1:06:56] there first has been satisfied what they
[1:07:00] were longing for the thirst that made
[1:07:02] him room here and do that and do that it
[1:07:04] was a thirst that was calling for
[1:07:06] something that was satisfy something
[1:07:09] that could quench that thirst and God
[1:07:13] Himself brought you and I into the
[1:07:16] quenching process but after the
[1:07:19] quenching process as we just read we've
[1:07:21] got to be aged mature because we're born
[1:07:26] a spirit babe in Christ we've got to be
[1:07:30] aged or formed into the word image
[1:07:34] tempered or stress relief
[1:07:37] what's the stress what's the tension it
[1:07:40] ain't God it's when the word starts
[1:07:43] dealing with us come on somebody is when
[1:07:48] it starts dealing with us it starts
[1:07:50] getting down where that things that you
[1:07:53] and I can see
[1:07:54] called bringing it to light in your sing
[1:07:56] Lord help me Lord help me like God
[1:08:00] changed me shape me Lord God God will
[1:08:06] allow those stresses to be there maybe
[1:08:09] it's our own reliance how did we handle
[1:08:12] things I don't need nobody else's help
[1:08:15] just me and God wow I don't know where
[1:08:19] that fits at in Scripture but the one
[1:08:21] thing I do need I need Almighty God and
[1:08:23] he might use one of you all to speak to
[1:08:26] me and to help me because you wanna know
[1:08:28] why we are a body so I need him and I
[1:08:34] need every gift he's got if I am his
[1:08:37] bride you believe you're his bride then
[1:08:39] we must by receiving every gift he sends
[1:08:43] we prove were his bride you with me his
[1:08:49] bride does not have a diamond on her
[1:08:50] finger that only has one gift come on
[1:08:53] somebody and the message oneness the
[1:08:56] Prophet said she proves she is the bride
[1:08:58] by receiving every one of his gifts
[1:09:05] glory be to God hallelujah you see
[1:09:10] sometimes people are wanting to you you
[1:09:12] to receive what they have to say and
[1:09:14] they're skeptical of everything else
[1:09:15] everybody else says to them how can you
[1:09:17] expect your word to be received when you
[1:09:19] yourself are skeptical but see God knows
[1:09:22] how to work on you and I and I'm so glad
[1:09:25] about that he knows how to temper after
[1:09:28] we've been quenched Lord God temporal
[1:09:31] way Lord Jesus my flesh is not crying
[1:09:34] out for tempering but my soul says the
[1:09:36] Lord temper me a temper me Lord God Who
[1:09:41] am I now notice this in Exodus 3 verse 2
[1:09:45] the angel of the Lord appeared on the in
[1:09:48] speaking of Moses in a flame of fire out
[1:09:51] of the bush out of the midst of a bush
[1:09:53] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[1:09:57] with fire and the bush was not concerned
[1:10:01] there's not one of you in here not want
[1:10:03] to be including me that we would ever
[1:10:05] think about lighting up a bush and you
[1:10:07] know
[1:10:08] times around the edges of our properties
[1:10:10] and other stuff like that they're dry
[1:10:11] right now
[1:10:12] they're dry you can light them up nobody
[1:10:15] would think about lighting a bush on
[1:10:17] fire but this was not a man-made fire
[1:10:21] this was a fire by the angel of the Lord
[1:10:24] and it was burning this bush was burning
[1:10:29] with fire it wasn't some little flame it
[1:10:34] was but yet the bush itself wasn't
[1:10:39] consumed what was God's showing you and
[1:10:42] I the miracle of the new birth where the
[1:10:45] fire of God can move down in our soul
[1:10:48] and yet here we are a part of us has
[1:10:51] been consumed but yet the rest of us
[1:10:55] here we are new creation in the same Oh
[1:11:01] in the message the angel beloit when God
[1:11:05] spoke to him and attracted his attention
[1:11:06] about tiller fire that fell into a bush
[1:11:09] and begin to burn and pop and burn it
[1:11:11] looks like if it was a fire it would
[1:11:14] have scorched the bush or burned it but
[1:11:16] it was a supernatural fire who could
[1:11:18] burn the bush and yet it would still be
[1:11:21] there
[1:11:22] I'm thankful tonight for a supernatural
[1:11:24] the Holy Spirit God's flame of fire who
[1:11:27] could come down in the human heart and
[1:11:29] burn out all the sin and unbelief it
[1:11:32] don't harm the person but it purchase
[1:11:34] him
[1:11:35] it makes him grow greater be stronger
[1:11:37] more faith and he comes tonight in that
[1:11:40] same way
[1:11:41] glory be to God so this was a type of
[1:11:45] you and I hope he can come down into a
[1:11:49] human body and drive out the power of
[1:11:52] cancer tumor cataract tuberculosis with
[1:11:55] fire
[1:11:55] heavenly holy spirit fire falling from
[1:11:58] God out of heaven why that's no mystery
[1:12:01] if he can burn inbred sin out how much
[1:12:05] more can he burn cancer out by the same
[1:12:07] Holy Spirit
[1:12:10] amen the same Holy Ghost that burnt-out
[1:12:13] inbred sin is the same Holy Ghost we
[1:12:18] have been quenched quenched quits for
[1:12:23] what temporary made ready for the
[1:12:29] molding and shaping process the semi you
[1:12:35] mean to tell me when I was born again
[1:12:38] that I did not receive my character you
[1:12:40] receive the life of his character and
[1:12:43] their life of his character works with
[1:12:46] Union you and I to bring forth his
[1:12:48] character but there's no way that that
[1:12:51] character can be produced without
[1:12:53] suffering without test and without
[1:12:57] trials
[1:12:58] that's God's oh my look at this here in
[1:13:08] God's provided way of fellowship brother
[1:13:11] never said Daniel in the presence of the
[1:13:13] lions maintained his fellowship the Holy
[1:13:17] Spirit come right and lived down there
[1:13:20] with him talked with him all night the
[1:13:22] Hebrew children in the fiery furnace hot
[1:13:24] fire that even killed the men that
[1:13:26] throat' him in the heat of the furnace
[1:13:27] killed him in that throw them in but
[1:13:30] they maintained their fellowship look at
[1:13:33] this now the devil cannot put a trial
[1:13:36] upon you too hard unless you maintain
[1:13:39] that fellowship if you've come God's
[1:13:41] provided way of approach you're a son of
[1:13:44] God the world's burn out of you you've
[1:13:47] entered into the Shekinah glory the
[1:13:49] Spirit of God is in your heart
[1:13:52] we're not bragging on ourselves we're
[1:13:54] bragging on his work there's not a trial
[1:13:58] he can put on you are i as a son and
[1:14:01] daughter of God that has been burned
[1:14:02] that's been burned on the inside out and
[1:14:05] filled with this power there's not a
[1:14:07] trial too hard for my son
[1:14:14] trials home our trials there'd been many
[1:14:17] trials that have been way harder I'll
[1:14:22] put it like this every trial has been
[1:14:25] harder than what my spirit or my flesh
[1:14:28] because it has not been my flesh or my
[1:14:31] spirit it hasn't been your flesh or your
[1:14:34] spirit it's the soul that holds steady
[1:14:36] in the midst of it even when you would
[1:14:39] go to start questioning why or your mind
[1:14:41] starts wondering have I done something
[1:14:43] have I done something displeasing to him
[1:14:44] why why is this happening all of a
[1:14:46] sudden you'll find yourself you'll catch
[1:14:48] yourself it isn't you as far as a person
[1:14:50] but there's a wind that comes it's
[1:14:53] something that rises up from within you
[1:14:56] to be able to say Lord you're directing
[1:14:59] this and when that happens you feel
[1:15:03] smitten you feel smitten because they
[1:15:06] even allow a thought but remember that
[1:15:08] thought was not your thought Oh glory so
[1:15:17] here I'm not gonna read this next
[1:15:21] section here brother Bryan almost skip
[1:15:22] here in just a minute I'll let you
[1:15:23] normally go but Steel's it goes into
[1:15:25] this section here I don't want to read
[1:15:26] it I just want to refer to it but it
[1:15:28] goes on to talk about how Steel's
[1:15:30] themselves are now are never used in the
[1:15:35] quenched condition they've got to be
[1:15:39] tempered but the quenching is necessary
[1:15:45] God knows what he's preparing for our
[1:15:49] lives that's saying that the quenching
[1:15:52] isn't real but God's tempering and
[1:15:55] molding and shaping you and I getting us
[1:15:58] ready for all of those appointments in
[1:16:01] life are you with me you could not take
[1:16:06] David David had an experience but David
[1:16:09] had a line and David had a bear you see
[1:16:13] before Goliath who was that that was God
[1:16:17] the Bible says when God led Israel out
[1:16:20] of Egypt he led them out of Egypt and he
[1:16:23] didn't lead them in the way of the
[1:16:24] Philistine
[1:16:26] by the coast Lester people would get
[1:16:27] discouraged but yet he let him in a way
[1:16:30] that was trial after trial test after
[1:16:33] test places where they had nowhere to
[1:16:36] turn no way to run to they had him he
[1:16:40] was proven to them all those stages
[1:16:43] along the journey was God proving
[1:16:46] himself to Israel that I who brought you
[1:16:49] out I brought you this far I will keep
[1:16:53] you safe along amen
[1:16:56] God was letting it be known to them I've
[1:16:58] watched over you you couldn't have
[1:17:00] brought yourself out of Egypt your power
[1:17:04] could not have liberated you but I came
[1:17:07] down and liberated you he brought him
[1:17:12] each step of the way you know God as we
[1:17:13] live we we we looked at that some weeks
[1:17:15] ago God leads Bible says that the Lord
[1:17:19] Jesus himself walking up out of the
[1:17:22] water and the heavens open the Bible
[1:17:25] said he was led out of the spirit into
[1:17:30] the wilderness to be tempted
[1:17:34] it was led they see these these tests
[1:17:38] and trials are not just happenstance
[1:17:40] --es they are ordained because God knows
[1:17:48] you and I he knows the character that
[1:17:52] lays in our life he knows your
[1:17:54] disposition he knows my disposition and
[1:17:57] he knows exactly how to work in our
[1:18:00] lives to bring out after we've been
[1:18:03] quenched and the micro structure of
[1:18:06] stresses beyond human eyes he knows how
[1:18:10] to temper age and relieve those stresses
[1:18:17] trials trials would be a relief of
[1:18:22] stress it's how we look at it I don't
[1:18:26] know about you but tests and trials
[1:18:28] sometimes when I go through tests and
[1:18:30] trials my body feels it
[1:18:34] sometimes things come out you know and
[1:18:36] whatever more you know the things you
[1:18:37] think mild feeling pretty good
[1:18:39] I never ill I was under that much stress
[1:18:41] you're with me sometimes it'll take
[1:18:44] sleep from your body it'll take your
[1:18:47] appetite you probably look at me and say
[1:18:49] I don't think it's that's yours buddy
[1:18:52] maybe it made me think more about food I
[1:18:54] don't know oh I need another little lip
[1:18:58] I mean another ho ho another rest you
[1:19:08] all are like that my goodness y'all you
[1:19:12] almost have a praise and worship service
[1:19:14] when you're going through your tests and
[1:19:15] trials actors sometimes it keeps you up
[1:19:25] sometimes you have to battle the stretch
[1:19:28] because the stress would want to come
[1:19:29] right into your home and you have to
[1:19:33] battle the way you ran but the whole
[1:19:35] time wait a minute I cannot allow this
[1:19:37] to affect my home here you are being
[1:19:43] molded and shaped and here you are at
[1:19:47] the same time God didn't put you up on a
[1:19:49] in a sleeper and just say just stay up
[1:19:52] there I'll do all the work
[1:19:53] just right here no you and I are not
[1:19:55] just if I could say like this we're not
[1:19:58] just lifeless images we have feelings we
[1:20:04] have parts about our life stresses and
[1:20:08] how many tell you this right here but
[1:20:10] real stresses it ain't nobody else but
[1:20:12] me
[1:20:12] it's parts in my life parts in your life
[1:20:18] you understand God isn't giving me a
[1:20:23] trial that all of a sudden that you know
[1:20:26] it'll somehow change somebody else know
[1:20:28] God allows me to be changed what's he
[1:20:34] trying to do reduce me reduce you
[1:20:39] but if we can get reduced God can do
[1:20:42] things that Samuel don't know nothing
[1:20:43] about Seurat
[1:20:49] so this tempering and temperature
[1:20:52] there's a final product to be produced
[1:20:55] now go down brother Brian where the
[1:20:58] heading it says why what is quenching
[1:21:00] and tempering let me just read in there
[1:21:02] a little bit quenching and tempering are
[1:21:07] processes that strengthen and harden
[1:21:10] materials like steel and other iron
[1:21:11] based alloys the process of quenching or
[1:21:14] quench hardening involves heating the
[1:21:16] material and then rapidly cooling in
[1:21:18] water oil forced air or inert gases such
[1:21:21] as nitrogen the process is tightly
[1:21:24] controlled with the heating temperature
[1:21:26] cooling method cooling substance and
[1:21:29] cooling speed all depending upon the
[1:21:31] type of material being quenched and the
[1:21:33] desired hardness God knew the process
[1:21:37] that you and I needed after look at this
[1:21:41] now after the material has been quenched
[1:21:44] to its hardest state the process of
[1:21:47] tempering is used to achieve greater
[1:21:51] toughness and ductility by decreasing so
[1:22:00] wait a minute I'm to be brought to a
[1:22:02] place of hardness and then I'm to be
[1:22:05] reduced there's a part of you and me
[1:22:10] that had to be brought to hardness and
[1:22:13] then there's a part of you and I that's
[1:22:15] got to be reduced in hardness I must
[1:22:19] decrease that he might increase glory be
[1:22:28] to God tempering I'll get to some of
[1:22:30] these words in a minute tempering is
[1:22:32] achieved by heating the quenched
[1:22:35] material to below of a critical point
[1:22:37] for a set period of time then allowing
[1:22:39] it to cool in still air oh my now for a
[1:22:45] season anybody see what day that
[1:22:47] winter's started on
[1:22:51] no you didn't I didn't either he wasn't
[1:22:55] on the first snowfall it fades from one
[1:22:58] season to another you can look and I can
[1:23:03] look out my window and say boy I'm
[1:23:05] waiting on spring I'm looking for spring
[1:23:07] I've got it out hold it'll feed in and
[1:23:11] just as quick as it fades in it'll fade
[1:23:14] out seasons come in seasons go out it's
[1:23:20] like the ages they don't have abrupt
[1:23:22] stopping they overlap it's why with
[1:23:27] trials tempering in our life there isn't
[1:23:29] things of abrupt stopping there's a
[1:23:32] coming in and then there's a fading out
[1:23:38] it didn't just automatically stops it
[1:23:42] fades in and I know some of you just
[1:23:46] like me you're wondering saying Lord is
[1:23:48] it gonna fade in stronger it's very
[1:23:52] strong right now it's pretty hot right
[1:23:54] now Lord but he says I know what
[1:24:02] stresses I'm trying to relieve in your
[1:24:04] life stresses Lord I've asked for peace
[1:24:08] and comfort but I told you through my
[1:24:10] prophet I gave you the best comfort you
[1:24:13] could have tests and trials that's the
[1:24:16] greatest thing that could happen to you
[1:24:18] but in our mind we say Lord the best
[1:24:21] thing would be to me is there a hotel
[1:24:23] Lord that not only provides Linens
[1:24:26] but it is stress-free environment when I
[1:24:30] go into their Lord God I forget about
[1:24:32] everything you could be on an island and
[1:24:36] be stressed this life was not meant to
[1:24:42] be easy I know we all listen we all
[1:24:45] appreciate the times of reprieve don't
[1:24:47] we we appreciate when the trial or the
[1:24:50] temptation is over and God knows after
[1:24:54] that we need ministering to we love that
[1:24:59] we appreciate that we look forward to
[1:25:02] win that is over with
[1:25:05] but in the meantime it's like as the
[1:25:08] Prophet could tell us Lord don't take
[1:25:10] the trials from me but just give me your
[1:25:13] grace just give me your grace in order
[1:25:18] to go through mama here in the benefits
[1:25:24] of quenching in tempered plate y'all
[1:25:28] gonna be applying for some another job
[1:25:29] Stan aren't you you be signing up man
[1:25:32] for benefits of quenched and tempered
[1:25:35] plate you're not thinking about that are
[1:25:38] you brother you no no no now tempting at
[1:25:40] all is it no by tempering quenched still
[1:25:44] it becomes less brittle and more ductile
[1:25:49] without sacrificing too much hardness
[1:25:52] now these are things that when I've
[1:25:55] studied this here that these people are
[1:25:57] bragging on that steel that is present
[1:26:00] now it's steel that's quenched and
[1:26:02] tempered being even more resilient than
[1:26:06] in times past it is the combination of
[1:26:10] these two processes notice the
[1:26:12] combination of these two processes that
[1:26:14] produces a harder tougher steel that's
[1:26:18] more weldable and ductile than ordinary
[1:26:24] carbon steel let me tell you something
[1:26:28] you're not ordinary carbon steel you are
[1:26:33] sought out
[1:26:36] you have been sought out and brought to
[1:26:39] him and he is quenched you that he might
[1:26:44] temper you and me but he wants to make
[1:26:48] this steel path hard but yet it's got to
[1:26:52] also have to be weldable to be ductile
[1:26:57] or pliable so this weldable what
[1:27:00] weldable itself means in case you don't
[1:27:02] know the word it means to join together
[1:27:05] like taking pieces and joining them
[1:27:07] together by heating to the point of
[1:27:09] melting using a blowtorch or electric
[1:27:11] art or other means uniting them by
[1:27:14] pressing and hammering so in other words
[1:27:17] it's the unifying or unity bringing
[1:27:21] unity so you mean that how that the
[1:27:24] tempering process would work on you and
[1:27:27] me would make us weldable well I don't
[1:27:33] need no other part of the body oh yes
[1:27:36] you do we need one another the foot
[1:27:42] cannot say to the hand I don't need you
[1:27:45] you are not the whole body in yourself
[1:27:47] and neither am i but we are a part of
[1:27:50] the body baptized by one spirit into the
[1:27:54] body and then the stress is in our life
[1:27:57] my if God could have just sent me in a
[1:27:59] church with the pastor according to my
[1:28:03] molding if God could have just made it
[1:28:05] so everybody in the church was just like
[1:28:08] me god forbid god forbid that everybody
[1:28:13] was like me I got enough problems with
[1:28:16] me
[1:28:18] you see it's usually the things that we
[1:28:21] choose are the things we don't need but
[1:28:24] our choosing is to be directed by
[1:28:27] Almighty God because God knows exactly
[1:28:30] what we need it's not us that knows what
[1:28:32] we need Oh God this word this message is
[1:28:37] should never make you our self-reliant
[1:28:40] self dependent if it is it's the wrong
[1:28:42] spirit as a matter of fact when it's
[1:28:45] correctly revealed it reveals to you and
[1:28:47] I our need of total depend
[1:28:49] see on him what I need you more now than
[1:28:54] I ever did Lord God I'm more realize a
[1:28:57] more aware of that part of my life that
[1:29:00] need to be more weldable it's easy to be
[1:29:03] weldable with people of like precious
[1:29:06] temperaments oh they mean I mean like
[1:29:09] precious faith lot precious dispositions
[1:29:14] they think like me they think like you I
[1:29:17] mean that's just God right no God has a
[1:29:22] sense of humor he'll put together a
[1:29:25] conglomeration and alloy of quenched
[1:29:31] vessels and then he works to weld us
[1:29:34] together but how does he work to make
[1:29:37] you and I weldable he works on you in
[1:29:40] your parts and he works on me in my
[1:29:43] parts he didn't just you know it didn't
[1:29:45] just me saying Lord you need to work on
[1:29:47] this guy he's not weldable Lord we're
[1:29:49] calling him Lord got poured on him Lord
[1:29:51] pouring on him making weldable Lord know
[1:29:55] the real reality if there's something
[1:29:57] about brother Enoch that's rubbing it
[1:29:59] ain't brother Enoch it's me it's stress
[1:30:03] that needs to be relieved how is it
[1:30:06] relieved by the overcomer dwelling in
[1:30:08] you and us surrendering to the overcomer
[1:30:11] and then that's how we overcome Peter
[1:30:17] God I don't think they ever taught this
[1:30:19] and what's that safety classes osha or
[1:30:22] something like that mercy you realize
[1:30:26] you needed safety glasses in here
[1:30:27] tonight he needed some gloves to be able
[1:30:30] to handle this word as it was coming it
[1:30:36] allows you weldability is known as being
[1:30:39] joint ability so the word itself coming
[1:30:45] and working in our lives dealing with
[1:30:47] our lives
[1:30:48] bringing us to a place to say lord I
[1:30:50] need more of you and the suffering the
[1:30:52] molding the testing trial
[1:30:53] what's God doing God's will Deniz body
[1:30:55] together
[1:30:58] suffering or not to drive us apart come
[1:31:02] on somebody
[1:31:03] persecution does not drive the body of
[1:31:05] Christ apart it draws the body together
[1:31:10] God knows exactly what to do to do what
[1:31:14] caused the body to draw together I'm
[1:31:17] asked you to I'm gonna say this like
[1:31:18] this if God allowed everything right
[1:31:20] here in this church if everything went
[1:31:21] 100% right on nobody had any tests or
[1:31:24] trials we never had to pray about
[1:31:25] anybody losing the job we never had to
[1:31:27] pray about sickness or whatever more we
[1:31:28] would be such spoiled brats there were
[1:31:31] nobody want to ever come here and sit
[1:31:33] down because you want to know why God
[1:31:36] wouldn't be here because the church that
[1:31:40] is not being tested or tried the
[1:31:42] prophets words is the church that does
[1:31:44] not have it so it's testing that's
[1:31:49] trying it's things that are gone what is
[1:31:51] that that's vindication of the life
[1:31:53] within you it proves the life that is
[1:31:58] there within you
[1:32:03] joint ability how many would say Lord
[1:32:05] make me more weldable I got both my
[1:32:09] hands up making me more weldable Lord
[1:32:11] not more routable with the people that
[1:32:13] I'm weldable with let me just say this
[1:32:15] very clearly there's going to be people
[1:32:16] right here look in the body of Jesus
[1:32:18] Christ they're not going to be your best
[1:32:20] buddies but neither are those two
[1:32:24] somehow that are your best buddies
[1:32:26] should there ever come a clannish spirit
[1:32:28] among you
[1:32:29] that's not weldability let's be clear on
[1:32:32] that
[1:32:33] that's called a weak link we don't have
[1:32:41] a million Gospels here there's one
[1:32:42] gospel we preach it's the gospel of
[1:32:45] Jesus Christ it's not the gospel of
[1:32:47] Samuel Browning not the gospel of joy
[1:32:49] bell's not the gospel of john Kadima not
[1:32:51] the gospel of enoch Kadima it is one
[1:32:54] gospel the gospel of Jesus Christ so
[1:32:57] there is one motive one objective and
[1:33:00] that's the unity of the body even where
[1:33:02] Paul himself in intercessory prayer
[1:33:05] could say in Philippians 2 his prayer
[1:33:09] was that we would
[1:33:11] filled with boughs of mercy like-minded
[1:33:16] toward one another well what's gonna be
[1:33:20] what's gonna bring that about temporary
[1:33:23] oh I agree
[1:33:26] the quenching will make will make
[1:33:30] tuxedos and bib Dover holes hug I agree
[1:33:35] but we've got to do more than hug we've
[1:33:37] got to walk together we've got to be
[1:33:41] able to fight together we've got to be
[1:33:42] able to live under the same roof and see
[1:33:45] one another's faults come on somebody in
[1:33:49] the Hebrew series the Prophet said you
[1:33:51] backslide on the people at church but
[1:33:53] you never backslide on God your backside
[1:33:57] on the people the church why the people
[1:33:58] the church can see it but you don't
[1:33:59] backslide on Christ you said you
[1:34:02] backslide on Christ you don't backslide
[1:34:03] on God go I God can't see you so we've
[1:34:09] got to be able to look you know how it
[1:34:10] is you get married now all of a sudden
[1:34:14] you have only seen the carols now you
[1:34:16] see the curlers you've seen what made
[1:34:21] the curls honey you look perfect in
[1:34:26] those pink curlers it just does
[1:34:30] something about your countenance you as
[1:34:35] me weldability none of us are signing up
[1:34:40] for weldability but yet we're from the
[1:34:43] inside lord I know I need to be more
[1:34:46] weldable so in order for to be more
[1:34:49] radical it isn't brother--he not you
[1:34:50] need to let this down in your life you
[1:34:52] need to know it's right here it's the
[1:34:56] stress that needs to be relieved right
[1:35:03] we're not talking about faking things
[1:35:06] friends like people if you've really got
[1:35:09] love if you really got love bless caught
[1:35:11] you ought to go over there
[1:35:12] that's called force-feeding love is not
[1:35:16] an action don't you reduce the love to
[1:35:18] be an action that way love itself must
[1:35:20] be can in the heart
[1:35:23] and if it starts in the heart you might
[1:35:26] be praying about something you might
[1:35:27] have a loved one or somebody that you've
[1:35:29] offended something that's been said and
[1:35:32] you might all of a sudden I just need to
[1:35:34] go talk to first of all make sure your
[1:35:36] heart is set right if not it's just
[1:35:42] hypocrisy even though your design it's
[1:35:44] got to be love you know the Prophet said
[1:35:46] this the scripture said this the Prophet
[1:35:47] said this that's all true
[1:35:49] Ben in order for all that to come you
[1:35:51] must die I want to be weldable Lord I
[1:35:58] want to be weldable when the fire comes
[1:36:03] on to reduce that stress to where that
[1:36:05] I'm able to come into there and be
[1:36:07] joined together my you mean this isn't
[1:36:13] just gifted no we're gifted to be able
[1:36:15] to submit here's the other part my lord
[1:36:20] we're time go don't say you know either
[1:36:26] it makes you more ductile dr. which is
[1:36:31] to be pliable pliant flexible supple
[1:36:37] plastic a tensile soft malleable
[1:36:40] workable bendable the opposite of
[1:36:45] brittle it hurt my feelings
[1:36:49] brittle don't mean you ain't been
[1:36:52] quenched when you've been quenched
[1:36:55] you're still brittle that's where the
[1:36:59] tempering has to remove the brittleness
[1:37:05] well this didn't go according to how I
[1:37:07] think it brittle brittle
[1:37:16] skál I've just got a stab gotta tell it
[1:37:17] brittle be careful you're not
[1:37:21] classifying things as the word and yet
[1:37:24] it's brittleness on your part lord help
[1:37:30] me be more pliable pliable means to wait
[1:37:34] on him be more malleable shapeable
[1:37:38] flexible y-you mean you don't want me to
[1:37:45] be rigid no he wants you to be tough but
[1:37:47] God doesn't want us to be without
[1:37:51] emotion without feeling you don't want
[1:37:55] things done without feeling he corrected
[1:37:58] his profit on that he wants what is
[1:38:01] truth to be done with feeling it is that
[1:38:06] right speaking the truth in love to make
[1:38:11] pliable malleable shapeable oh my I just
[1:38:14] got into this here my lord
[1:38:16] ductility a material as a measure of a
[1:38:20] materials ability to undergo significant
[1:38:23] plastic deformation before rupture
[1:38:26] ductility is often characterized by the
[1:38:29] materials ability to be stretched into a
[1:38:33] wire hmm didn't know you was able to be
[1:38:37] that long-suffering missus suffer its
[1:38:45] measured on the point of that plastic
[1:38:48] deformation how what is the limit we can
[1:38:52] take this thing before it deforms god
[1:38:56] knows the limits it's up to you and I
[1:38:59] before he ever starts oh lord stop
[1:39:01] you're stretching me too much Lord Lord
[1:39:03] it's too much honey put my hands on you
[1:39:06] yet
[1:39:09] Lord you stretch missile but he wants to
[1:39:16] make us it's not necessarily him
[1:39:18] stretching us he wants to make us let us
[1:39:23] send me round with me going through a
[1:39:24] trial make me a little bit more ductile
[1:39:27] well I'll tell you one one way one way
[1:39:30] is you could look at somebody else's
[1:39:32] trial and you could look at it there's
[1:39:35] nothing let's say I don't know why in
[1:39:37] the world they're always sick someone so
[1:39:40] sick okay what if they had faith and
[1:39:41] they just believed God they wouldn't be
[1:39:42] sick hmm wonder what hospital you're
[1:39:48] gonna be in I'm serious friends
[1:39:52] I wonder what God's going to allow to
[1:39:54] come your way because the one is being
[1:39:56] quoted and what's being said I don't
[1:39:58] find that to be out of that attitude or
[1:40:00] a heart that's ductile I find it to be
[1:40:03] out of something that's arrogant and God
[1:40:06] will allow you to see how it is
[1:40:09] how is that how is that if they just
[1:40:12] have faith how is that
[1:40:13] do you realize friends when a person
[1:40:15] themselves may endure with the disease
[1:40:17] or a sickness it is not that they do not
[1:40:19] have faith faith itself your healing you
[1:40:23] might have there might be setting in
[1:40:24] that condition right there and God would
[1:40:26] allow and permit that but remember God
[1:40:29] is faithful the faith is is that that
[1:40:32] faith will bring you to your healing
[1:40:33] whether it's in this body or the next
[1:40:36] body power transformation the Prophet
[1:40:38] looks down and recognizes the woman who
[1:40:40] is in the wheelchair and he said think
[1:40:42] of this lovely young lady we pray for
[1:40:44] her and steel she sits there in that
[1:40:45] wheelchair he said possibly how God has
[1:40:48] formed this beautiful young flower and
[1:40:50] yet she stands here sits here
[1:40:52] happy God proves and says see there's
[1:40:56] people and I may not move every little
[1:41:00] thing for them but that doesn't matter
[1:41:02] to them they're not in love with me
[1:41:04] because they got straight legs they're
[1:41:07] in love with me because of me not what I
[1:41:10] can do for him that's real faith I said
[1:41:14] that's real faith listen friends there's
[1:41:16] people who has that faith to be healed
[1:41:18] Mira
[1:41:19] and yet not faith to walk with the Lord
[1:41:21] I ask you what would you rather be faith
[1:41:26] to have everything your healing and
[1:41:28] everything else or would you rather to
[1:41:30] have a faith that resonates with inside
[1:41:32] of your heart a loyalty that beats out
[1:41:35] that stands there in the face of
[1:41:37] everything and says who who shall
[1:41:42] separate us from the love of God Paul
[1:41:46] didn't mess up there when he didn't say
[1:41:48] what he said who because it's who that
[1:41:52] comes through all of those other having
[1:41:54] us God knows what he's doing and he'll
[1:42:01] do that part to bring a little bit of
[1:42:03] humility our way you know why because He
[1:42:05] loves us he's looking at us and saying
[1:42:08] you know what with that kind of an
[1:42:09] attitude you're not weldable son with
[1:42:12] that kind you're not you're not you
[1:42:13] don't have no ductility you're not
[1:42:15] malleable pliable you've already got
[1:42:17] your mind formed up malleability a
[1:42:31] similar property is a materials ability
[1:42:33] to deform under compressive stress that
[1:42:38] is often characterized by the materials
[1:42:41] ability to form a thin sheet the
[1:42:44] hammering or rolling these properties
[1:42:49] are known as plasticity which is the
[1:42:51] quality of being easily shaped or moment
[1:42:56] I wonder tonight in us in our lives
[1:43:00] where does our plasticity rank on his
[1:43:04] scale
[1:43:08] but what matters is is that either begun
[1:43:12] the good work he's gonna finish no
[1:43:15] matter where our plasticity is tonight
[1:43:17] our able to be molded and shaped he's
[1:43:23] gonna get the job done and he's gonna
[1:43:26] bring us to the place of submission that
[1:43:28] he can work because he ain't gonna do it
[1:43:29] by force he leads us your loving look at
[1:43:40] these things here that they make this
[1:43:41] this toughness factor these measures you
[1:43:44] got them slides up there brother have
[1:43:46] the PowerPoint if you don't have it
[1:43:49] that's okay I'll go on some of these
[1:43:54] things right here well I could get my
[1:43:55] glasses on I came to see these things
[1:43:57] look at this storage tank bridges and
[1:44:02] high-rise building how many of you glad
[1:44:04] that bridges have some quenched and
[1:44:06] tempered steel or would you say I don't
[1:44:09] matter clenched is good enough no it's
[1:44:13] got to be quenched and tempered you did
[1:44:18] you all do you all see signs on bridges
[1:44:20] let's say quenched only you got seats in
[1:44:25] you guys see signs on stinks to see
[1:44:27] quenched only not temporary they don't
[1:44:32] have to put those signs on there because
[1:44:34] if they've made it to there that's what
[1:44:37] they have been purposed all of the
[1:44:42] heating all of the cooling has been with
[1:44:45] the product in mind and God already has
[1:44:48] taken a picture of you and I he knows
[1:44:52] exactly what he's bringing forth in our
[1:44:55] life he already knows the outcome so
[1:44:58] he's working through all the testing and
[1:45:01] the cooling to bring forth wouldn't it
[1:45:04] be terrible if it was a loader bucket
[1:45:06] like that third one right there and it
[1:45:08] was not able to handle abrasions every
[1:45:12] time I went to scoop up earth big old
[1:45:14] marks what put in it
[1:45:18] say Lord Jesus I want to be sensitive
[1:45:21] but I don't want to wear my feelings or
[1:45:24] my arms I have feelings you got feelings
[1:45:29] there right but lord help me help me
[1:45:34] that isn't something that he does for us
[1:45:37] he brings us in through that place we're
[1:45:40] never going to be without feelings in
[1:45:42] our life but we are coming into a place
[1:45:44] to where we don't allow our feelings to
[1:45:47] dominate us go to the next one
[1:45:52] gear wheels I know you're glad for those
[1:45:55] gear wheels on the elevator oh yeah see
[1:46:01] God makes gears we're gears of a
[1:46:04] timepiece the gears are all going
[1:46:08] together to tell the time it works
[1:46:11] together than to see how that even those
[1:46:14] liners of a dump truck my lord liner of
[1:46:17] a dump truck I don't want to be a line
[1:46:19] of a dump truck David said I would
[1:46:21] rather be a doorkeeper the Prophet picks
[1:46:25] it up and calls it a doormat at the
[1:46:28] house of God now you know I've had
[1:46:30] carpets at my door when you walk in and
[1:46:32] you go to wipe your feet on them they
[1:46:33] follow you all the way through the house
[1:46:35] because you want to know why they're not
[1:46:37] held down well we want to be doormats
[1:46:40] where the feet can be wiped on it if I
[1:46:44] say Amen
[1:46:45] I want to be a good liner go to Samuel
[1:46:51] I'm the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:46:53] woo Wow
[1:46:59] chutes carry precious things cargo the
[1:47:02] cold other things a low loader trailer
[1:47:06] my good what wait you're built to handle
[1:47:11] the weight the stresses balloons you
[1:47:17] don't think so I don't think so
[1:47:19] but I'll say what he said I can do all
[1:47:24] things through Christ who strengthens me
[1:47:26] if he has given me a trial or giving you
[1:47:29] a trial I'm gonna hear what he said
[1:47:31] through the Prophet to me it shows God's
[1:47:35] got confidence because he's doing
[1:47:39] something he knows what he's bringing
[1:47:41] out in our life let me leave you with
[1:47:44] this I'm closing I am
[1:47:46] let me just can I leave you with these
[1:47:47] scriptures and quote whether you said
[1:47:50] Amen listen Romans 12:1 think of this
[1:47:58] think of the template think of the
[1:48:00] tempering in our lives I beseech you
[1:48:03] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[1:48:09] that you present your bodies a living
[1:48:12] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:48:16] is your reasonable service and be not
[1:48:21] conformed to this world but be you
[1:48:26] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:48:30] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:48:34] acceptable and perfect God this isn't
[1:48:39] just us changing our thinking it's
[1:48:43] renewing of the Holy Ghost renewing our
[1:48:49] transformation I love this quote that's
[1:48:53] what we all want to do be not conformed
[1:48:55] to this world but be transformed by the
[1:48:57] renewing of our mind to do the perfect
[1:48:59] and acceptable will of God now that we
[1:49:02] have been saved as we are and that we
[1:49:05] have been filled with the Holy Spirit as
[1:49:07] we have now we want the mind that was in
[1:49:11] Christ to be in us well brothers had you
[1:49:16] what happened when we've been born again
[1:49:18] isn't that the mind of Christ it is but
[1:49:21] we still use our mind too much and not
[1:49:27] his mind so he knows how to relieve the
[1:49:32] stress now we want the man that was in
[1:49:35] Christ to be in us that we might be
[1:49:38] transformed
[1:49:39] from the natural things of life and be
[1:49:43] brought in to do the perfect will of God
[1:49:46] by transformation of God's Spirit by his
[1:49:50] word so I've been saved filled with the
[1:49:56] Holy Ghost now to have the mind of
[1:49:59] Christ operating in us to do what bring
[1:50:04] us from the natural things transform us
[1:50:09] by his Spirit by his word I'll say this
[1:50:15] he's doing a good job I feel so small in
[1:50:20] saying that but I know this right here I
[1:50:23] can testify he does all things he's
[1:50:29] brought forth all of those who lived
[1:50:30] down through time he's brought them to
[1:50:32] where he had them to be God kept working
[1:50:37] with Abraham renewing renewing renewing
[1:50:43] he's still working on you he's still
[1:50:46] working on me the test the trial God is
[1:50:52] for us let him quench you and you've
[1:50:58] been quenched let him temporary send
[1:51:01] Lord Jesus
[1:51:05] true we could be sad we can be sorrowful
[1:51:09] the test the trial we don't feel like
[1:51:12] rejoicing at the trial but we can pray
[1:51:14] and that's what we should do the Bible
[1:51:17] says in the book of James if any that's
[1:51:19] afflicted let him pray
[1:51:33] let's pray
[1:51:38] or Jesus we thank you tonight Lord God
[1:51:45] for your mercy Lord Jesus Lord as we
[1:51:50] look into these things I know Lord a lot
[1:51:53] of the words even when I first looked
[1:51:57] over these words Lord these things when
[1:51:59] it dropped in my heart Lord and weeks
[1:52:01] weeks ago Lord I looked at him Lord I
[1:52:07] loved him on that's what a quite a
[1:52:08] process but more Jesus what it comes
[1:52:11] down to this is how the understanding
[1:52:13] when it's in that time your desire and
[1:52:17] what you're doing with intestine trials
[1:52:20] or God your tempering us
[1:52:26] or Jesus we've been quenched what if
[1:52:31] there's one here tonight this is not
[1:52:32] been quenched they can receive that
[1:52:35] quenching tonight Lord an anchor
[1:52:40] Lord Jesus were thankful because we know
[1:52:42] that it is that blessed anchor of the
[1:52:45] soul Lord Jesus
[1:52:51] as we go through the tests in the trials
[1:52:55] the Lord we looked at it last week we're
[1:52:57] either coming in one or we're going out
[1:53:00] of one sometimes the Lord it seems like
[1:53:04] the duration between them sometimes it

[1:56:50] the good work will perform in unto the
[1:56:52] day of Jesus Christ
