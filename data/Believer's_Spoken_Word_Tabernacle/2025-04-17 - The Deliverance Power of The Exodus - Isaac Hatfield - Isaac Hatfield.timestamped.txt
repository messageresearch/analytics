[9:16] Let's pray this this evening. Kind and
[9:19] lovely Lord Jesus. How that song about
[9:22] your faithfulness just rejoices our
[9:24] heart because Lord, each one of us knows
[9:27] what a reality that that is. that it is
[9:30] not just some
[9:31] superstition or some abstract word, but
[9:34] it's a living, breathing reality in
[9:38] every area of our lives. And Father, as
[9:40] we come with these prayer requests,
[9:42] Lord, I just as I was listening to that
[9:45] song, I was just thinking about one of
[9:48] your Old Testament names, Elohim.
[9:51] how that
[9:52] name bound up in that name is the idea
[9:56] of strength and
[9:59] faithfulness. And I got to thinking,
[10:01] Lord, what good would strength be
[10:02] without faithfulness?
[10:05] And I was thinking, what good would
[10:06] faithfulness be without
[10:08] strength? But you have both, Lord. And
[10:11] you are the only being who has both. And
[10:14] you can do whatever it is that you said
[10:16] that you would do.
[10:18] And we know that if we look to you by
[10:20] faith, believing that all things are
[10:23] possible.
[10:24] We thank you tonight, Lord, for this
[10:26] time of of to get away for from the
[10:30] world and to get here to hear the word.
[10:32] And just Lord, prepare our hearts and
[10:35] just may we leave this place rejoicing
[10:39] and and giving glory to you, Lord,
[10:42] because you have forgiven our sins and
[10:45] you have to renew life in us. We ask
[10:50] this in Jesus name. Amen.

[36:16] How many just wants the Holy Spirit to
[36:17] have liberty in this place? Amen. That's
[36:20] our heart's desire. It's my heart's
[36:21] desire, too. Let's just sing this little
[36:24] chorus over the eyes as it comes.

[38:18] Amen. How many loves the Lord tonight?
[38:20] Amen. How many's happy to be in the
[38:22] house of God? Amen. as we think about
[38:25] what the Lord did for us this time of
[38:28] year over 2,000 years ago and paved the
[38:32] way. Amen. That we could gather here
[38:33] tonight and we're not gathering under a
[38:35] form or a creed, but we're gathering to
[38:38] honor the resurrected Christ who lives
[38:41] amongst us and in us and is walking with
[38:45] us. Amen. Day by day. Amen. Such a
[38:48] pleasure to serve the living God. Amen.
[38:51] And then we're just thankful for the
[38:52] opportunity to be here tonight. And if
[38:55] you have your Bibles, we'll just go
[38:56] straight to the word. We don't want to
[38:58] hold you long. And thank you musicians
[39:00] and song leaders. What a powerful
[39:02] atmosphere. I I was back there just
[39:05] waiting and it sounded so good that I
[39:07] just decided to walk out and enjoy what
[39:09] you guys were enjoying. Amen. I I just I
[39:13] just feel at home. Amen. Here. I just
[39:15] thankful for this assembly. Thankful for
[39:17] Brother Brian helping drive up this
[39:19] evening. May the Lord bless him for
[39:21] that. Amen. Exodus 3, if you have your
[39:25] Bibles, I mean, last time we were with
[39:28] you, we were in the book of Exodus. And
[39:29] if it's okay, we'd like to stay there.
[39:31] We just been where we've been at in our
[39:34] study. And we're going to read out
[39:36] Exodus 3 and then 2 Timothy 3 and then
[39:39] we'll have you be seated. But it says,
[39:41] "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[39:44] father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and
[39:46] he led the flock to the backside of the
[39:48] desert and came to the mountain of God,
[39:51] even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord
[39:53] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[39:55] of the midst of a bush. And he looked,
[39:56] and behold, the bush burned with fire,
[39:59] and the bush was not consumed." And
[40:01] Moses said, "I will now turn aside and
[40:03] see this great sight, why the bush is
[40:05] not burned." And when the Lord saw that
[40:07] he turned aside to see, God called unto
[40:10] him out of the midst of the bush and
[40:12] said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here
[40:14] am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh
[40:16] hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy
[40:18] feet. For the place where on thou
[40:20] standest is holy ground." Moreover, he
[40:23] said, "I am the God of thy father, the
[40:25] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And
[40:27] Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to
[40:29] look upon God. And the Lord said,"I have
[40:32] surely seen the affliction of my people
[40:35] which are in Egypt, and have heard their
[40:36] cry by reason of their task masters. For
[40:39] I know their sorrows, and I am come down
[40:41] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[40:42] Egyptians, and to bring them up out of
[40:44] that land, unto a good land, and a large
[40:47] unto a land flowing with milk and honey,
[40:49] unto the place of the Canaanites,
[40:51] Hittites, Amorites, and Perizzites, the
[40:53] Hivites, and the Jebusites. And now
[40:55] therefore, behold the cry of the
[40:57] children of Israel has come unto me, and
[40:59] I have also seen the oppression
[41:01] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them.
[41:03] So come now, therefore, and I will send
[41:05] thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
[41:07] bring forth my people, the children of
[41:09] Israel, out of Egypt? And Moses said
[41:11] unto God, Who am I that I should go unto
[41:14] Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth
[41:16] the children of Israel, out of Egypt?
[41:18] And he said, "Certainly, I will be with
[41:19] thee, and this shall be a token unto
[41:22] thee that I have sent thee when thou
[41:24] hast brought forth the people out of
[41:25] Egypt, you shall serve God upon this
[41:28] mountain." Amen. In 2 Timothy 3,
[41:32] starting in the first verse, it says,
[41:34] "This know also that in the last days
[41:37] perilous time shall come." And here he
[41:39] begins to describe a group. It says,
[41:42] "For men shall be lovers of their own
[41:43] selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
[41:45] blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
[41:47] unthankful, unholy, without natural
[41:50] affection, truce breakers, false
[41:51] accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers
[41:54] of those that are good, traitors, heady,
[41:57] high-minded, lovers of pleasure more
[41:58] than lovers of God." Now, that sounds
[42:00] pretty a bad state of affairs when he's
[42:04] describing that. But then he would go on
[42:05] to say that they would have a form of
[42:07] godliness and would deny the power
[42:09] thereof. From such turn away. For of
[42:12] this sort are they which creep into
[42:13] houses and lead captive silly woman
[42:15] laden with sins led away with diverse
[42:18] lust. Ever learning and never able to
[42:20] come to the knowledge of the truth. And
[42:22] now as Janice and Jambers withstood
[42:24] Moses, so do these also resist the
[42:26] truth. Men of corrupt minds reprobate
[42:28] concerning the faith. But they shall
[42:30] proceed no farther for their folly folly
[42:33] shall be manifest unto all men as theirs
[42:35] also was. Amen. Could we bow our heads
[42:38] for a word of prayer? Heavenly Father,
[42:41] we thank you for this grace you've given
[42:43] us, Lord, to gather into your presence,
[42:45] Father. Lord, to thank upon your word
[42:48] for just a few moments, Lord. And and
[42:51] Father, I pray that you just come down
[42:52] into our midst, Lord, and give us a
[42:55] grace, Lord Jesus, that something could
[42:57] be spoken, Father, that could help
[42:59] somebody along the way, Lord. That as a
[43:02] word goes out, may it go forth in power
[43:05] and anointing, Lord. That it might break
[43:07] through the shells, Lord, of the human
[43:09] spirit, Father, and find its way into
[43:11] the soul of souls, Lord. That it might
[43:14] bring to pass something of eternal
[43:16] value, Lord, in a heart or in a life,
[43:18] Father. Lord, that you bring
[43:20] encouragement to the discouraged. I pray
[43:22] that you bring healing to the sick,
[43:24] deliverance to the bound, Father, that
[43:26] you just move, I pray, in the midst of
[43:29] your beloved people tonight, Father.
[43:31] We'll be sure to give you the glory and
[43:32] honor in Jesus name I pray. Amen. And
[43:35] you may have your seats this evening.
[43:39] Amen.
[43:41] Amen. And I just if we could just take a
[43:43] little thought out of that for just a
[43:45] few moments. Just like to speak on the
[43:47] the delivering power of our Exodus. The
[43:51] the delivering power of our Exodus. As
[43:53] we spoke to you last time on getting in
[43:55] the spirit of Exodus, speaking on how
[43:58] the children of Israel had come into
[44:00] Egypt and they were there, but they
[44:02] weren't there to stay. They didn't
[44:03] belong there. And they were getting in
[44:05] the spirit of getting out of there, but
[44:07] they were under task masters. They were
[44:09] under great burdens. They were under a
[44:11] heavy load. They were under an
[44:13] affliction. And there was the armies of
[44:15] Egypt that that were surrounding them.
[44:17] And so, it was going to take a power to
[44:19] deliver them. They knew that God had
[44:22] promised they were going to leave, but
[44:23] but it was going to take a power. And it
[44:25] was going to take something greater than
[44:28] the forces of Egypt to take them out and
[44:30] fulfill the promise. And and as we spoke
[44:32] last time, it was at the junction of the
[44:35] Exodus that there come a new Pharaoh
[44:37] that rose up which knew not Joseph. And
[44:39] that was Ramsy's foretti was the
[44:42] pharaoh. He knew Joseph. He he knew the
[44:45] blessings of Joseph. He knew how Joseph
[44:47] had been used of the Lord in the seven
[44:49] years of famine. And they honored Joseph
[44:52] for those 400 years. But at this
[44:54] junction, God raised up a pharaoh
[44:56] Ramsy's who knew not Joseph. He and
[44:59] brother Brandon would say that what was
[45:02] Joseph represented? It was the spiritual
[45:04] part in this spiritual exodus. So
[45:06] Ramsy's knew not the spiritual part of
[45:09] the Exodus. He knew the military might.
[45:11] He knew the politics, but he didn't know
[45:13] the spiritual side of this Exodus. And
[45:16] so Egypt uh uh the children of Israel
[45:19] lived in Egypt for a season. And brother
[45:20] Brandham begins to tie this into
[45:22] Revelations 12:14 where it says to the
[45:25] woman were given two wings of a great
[45:27] eagle and that she might fly into the
[45:30] wilderness into her place where she is
[45:32] nourished for a time and times half a
[45:34] time from the face of the serpent.
[45:37] Showing that there the children of
[45:38] Israel were nourished for a time in that
[45:41] land. They they had seasons under
[45:43] Joseph's ministry where they were kept
[45:45] and they were nourished. But there was
[45:47] coming a junction where they were going
[45:49] to leave. And so there rose up a pharaoh
[45:51] which knew not the blessings of Joseph.
[45:53] Just like America, the the the the the
[45:56] pilgrims fled for religious freedom. And
[45:58] in this nation, they were nourished for
[46:00] a time. They were nourished for a
[46:02] season. It was a there was a season of
[46:05] freedom and great liberty. But brother
[46:07] Brandon would begin to tie in in our
[46:09] Exodus how we were receiving a Pharaoh
[46:11] which knew not Joseph. And he begins to
[46:13] tie that to Kennedy being elected into
[46:15] office and that was the first Catholic
[46:17] president. And begins to show how when
[46:19] Kennedy was swore into office, he
[46:21] wouldn't swear to the freedom of
[46:23] religion. Amen. And and it was a raising
[46:27] up at a junction showing that it was
[46:29] marking a time of Exodus. And and there
[46:32] in the the the first Exodus, Amen,
[46:34] Pharaoh uh feared the children of Israel
[46:37] that they would grow up and be a mighty
[46:39] army. And so he begins to set task
[46:41] masters over him and begins to and
[46:43] command even the midwives that if it's a
[46:45] male child that it should be killed at
[46:47] its birth. And there's been death in
[46:49] every exodus. And there in the first
[46:51] exodus Rams was commanding death to the
[46:53] children. And we find that in the second
[46:55] exodus that when Christ come on the
[46:58] scene in his first coming, Herod made a
[47:00] decree that every child under two years
[47:02] old should be killed. But brother
[47:03] Brandon would say in this third exodus,
[47:05] it wouldn't be natural death, but it
[47:07] would be spiritual death. how they would
[47:09] take those two seeds as Daniel would
[47:11] speak of that iron and clay and they
[47:13] would begin to intermingle them. How
[47:15] they would take those of those
[47:16] Christians and marry them into that
[47:18] Catholic system and it would actually be
[47:20] bringing spiritual death. That they
[47:22] would be cast into a bed of worldliness
[47:24] and that they would be spiritually
[47:26] killed. That the children would be
[47:28] raised up and married into that system
[47:30] and be destroyed. And it was a growing
[47:32] forth of a Ramsay's power. And brother
[47:35] Brandham said or in the church age book,
[47:37] it begins to describe how we've had one
[47:39] Catholic president and we'll no doubt
[47:40] have another. And we see even in the
[47:42] hour we're living that we've had another
[47:44] Catholic president, Joe Biden, and the
[47:47] cabinet's full of Catholics. And and and
[47:49] we know these things are only going to
[47:50] progress until eventually that they'll
[47:53] buy off America's debt and America will
[47:56] sell out to that power and and those
[47:58] things will come to full manifestation.
[48:00] But but it it's growing. It's exodus
[48:02] time. I mean, we see in our Exodus that
[48:04] Ramsy's is growing. Amen. And growing in
[48:08] in political power and growing in
[48:10] religious power, but but but but there's
[48:12] only two powers. And we want to make
[48:14] that known this evening that there's two
[48:16] powers. And you can take every church,
[48:19] you can take every system, every
[48:21] religion, every nation, and you can
[48:23] bring it down to two powers. And that's
[48:24] the power of God and the power of Satan.
[48:27] Amen. That's the power of God and the
[48:29] power of the devil. That's the power of
[48:31] life and the power of death. However you
[48:33] want to separate it, there's only two
[48:34] powers and Satan can only pervert the
[48:37] true power of God. Amen. A a lie is only
[48:40] a truth mistold and adultery is only a
[48:43] righteous act misrepresented and all
[48:45] these things. It's a power but it's only
[48:46] a perverted power. And while Ramsy's is
[48:49] growing, Brother Brandham said, "But
[48:51] remember, while Ramsy's was growing into
[48:53] power in Egypt, God had Moses in the
[48:56] wilderness. He was growing, too. Ramsy's
[48:59] had a political system, but God had a
[49:02] spiritual system under a prophet ready
[49:04] to come down to speak to the people.
[49:07] Amen. while Ramsay's is growing in power
[49:09] and we can even see that when Kennedy
[49:11] was in office was at the same time the
[49:14] seven seals were breaking forth because
[49:16] there's two powers and there's more than
[49:18] religious power and there's more than
[49:20] political power but God was establishing
[49:23] a supernatural power at the same time
[49:25] raising up establishing a spiritual
[49:28] system that would be under a prophet I
[49:30] mean that would lead the true believer
[49:31] out in an exodus that wouldn't be caught
[49:34] here in the deception of the spiritual
[49:36] uh corruption that even so much that you
[49:39] would be took up by the power of God
[49:41] till this Ramsay's power. Amen. Though
[49:43] it may be as close as it could be, but
[49:45] it won't deceive the very elect. If it
[49:48] were possible, it would. But it's not
[49:49] possible because you are a part of
[49:51] another system. Amen. You are a part of
[49:54] God's elect chosen bride that's been
[49:57] ordained to come out of her, my people,
[49:59] and to go into every promise and every
[50:01] blessing of the living God tonight. And
[50:04] we've been called out by revelation. and
[50:06] you've recognized the two spirits
[50:08] operating within the framework and you
[50:10] have uh uh recognized it and prevailed
[50:12] over it and you have become an
[50:14] invincible army. Amen. Because you have
[50:16] recognized, amen, the power of the
[50:19] prophet of the of the spiritual
[50:22] revelation that's been released in this
[50:23] age has caught you up in another power.
[50:28] I think of how God begins to establish
[50:30] this system here in Exodus and Moses
[50:33] actually come on the scene and he was
[50:35] born and the Bible says that when he was
[50:37] born that Jockabed looked upon him and
[50:39] saw that he was a goodly child. Now I I
[50:43] if you don't believe in election and
[50:44] predestination of God, I I just don't
[50:46] understand how somebody could come away
[50:48] with that after studying this message.
[50:51] how even at Moses's birth, the Bible
[50:54] describes him as a goodly child because
[50:56] gifts and callings are without
[50:57] repentance. Amen. And you are what you
[51:00] are by the grace of God. Amen. You have
[51:02] brown hair this evening and blue eyes or
[51:05] brown eyes and and blonde hair. Amen.
[51:08] Because of your makeup, because of your
[51:09] DNA, you didn't choose that. And you
[51:12] can't by thinking, you can't add one
[51:14] cubit to your stature by worrying, by
[51:17] fredding. And so it is in your
[51:19] supernatural birth. Amen. You were not
[51:22] Amen. Uh uh here this evening because
[51:24] you chose to be. You weren't saved
[51:26] because you chose to be. But it was
[51:28] God's grace. Amen. By grace are you
[51:30] saved through faith, not of your own
[51:33] selves, lest you should boast. But it's
[51:35] the grace of God that knew that you
[51:37] would desire to be saved and put your
[51:39] name on the lamb's book of life. By
[51:41] fornowledge he could predestinate you
[51:43] and call you that when you came on the
[51:45] scene, Amen. that he would know. Amen.
[51:48] And predestinate you because gifts and
[51:49] callings are without repentance. Amen.
[51:51] And a and if you're a preacher, you're a
[51:53] preacher whether you're saved or not.
[51:55] The gift is there. Amen. You you you you
[51:58] can you might be able to pray for the
[51:59] nine spiritual gifts. You might be able
[52:01] to pray to speak in tongues and things
[52:02] like that, but the offices of God, Amen,
[52:05] are not something that just come at your
[52:07] salvation, but they're in you always.
[52:10] They're without repentance. Just like a
[52:12] prophet is born a prophet. Amen. Moses
[52:15] was born a prophet. John the Baptist,
[52:18] amen, 712 years before he was born, the
[52:20] scripture said there was a voice of one
[52:22] out in the wilderness crying, "Prepare
[52:24] the way of the Lord." Amen. Jeremiah was
[52:27] ordained in his mother's womb to be a
[52:29] prophet. But brother Brandham doesn't
[52:30] just leave it there, but he goes on to
[52:32] say, "So are all true offices of God."
[52:35] Amen. If you are called of God, you
[52:37] didn't put yourself in that position,
[52:39] but God put you in that position. And he
[52:41] chose you in him before the foundation
[52:43] of the world. Amen. and elected you to
[52:45] be a son or daughter of God. And not
[52:47] only to be a son or daughter of God, but
[52:49] to be a preacher or a singer or a
[52:51] housewife. Amen. And if God called you,
[52:54] Amen. Nothing can stop what God has
[52:56] ordained you to do. Amen. But you'll be
[52:58] miserable until you heed to that call.
[53:00] Amen. But but but but it doesn't come
[53:02] and go. It's either there or it's not.
[53:05] Amen. It was there in Moses's life.
[53:07] Amen. Though Janice and Jambas couldn't
[53:10] be what Moses was. No matter how much
[53:12] they tried, they couldn't be what Moses
[53:14] was. For they were raised up for
[53:16] something different. Even the Bible says
[53:19] in Romans 9, as it is written, Jacob
[53:21] have I loved, and Esau have I hated. And
[53:24] in verse 15, it says, "For he saith to
[53:26] Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will
[53:29] have mercy, and I will have compassion
[53:31] on whom I will have compassion." So then
[53:33] it's not of him that willth or him that
[53:36] runth, but of God that showeth mercy.
[53:38] For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh,
[53:41] now there in verse 15, he saith to
[53:43] Moses. But now he's saying, the
[53:45] scripture saith unto Pharaoh, even for
[53:47] the same purpose have I raised thee up,
[53:49] that I might show my power in thee, and
[53:51] that my name might be declared
[53:52] throughout all the earth. Therefore, he
[53:54] have mercy on whom he will have mercy,
[53:56] and whom he will, he hardeneth. Amen. He
[54:00] hath mercy on whom will have mercy, and
[54:02] he hardeneth who he hardeneth. Brother
[54:03] Brandon would even say that Esau tried
[54:06] to find a place to repent and couldn't
[54:08] find it. Amen. Pharaoh tried to to let
[54:11] the people go. And plague after plague,
[54:13] he would say, "All right, just go. Get
[54:15] out of here." But God would harden his
[54:17] heart because there was a a will to be
[54:20] fulfilled in his life. And God hardens
[54:22] who he hardens. But I'm so thankful
[54:24] tonight that the scripture didn't stop
[54:26] there. But it said he has mercy on whom
[54:28] he will have mercy in this evening.
[54:30] Amen. If Pharaoh couldn't find a place
[54:32] to repent, and Esau couldn't find a
[54:34] place to repent, what about the bride?
[54:36] Amen. You may have tried to run as hard
[54:38] as you could run, but you couldn't run
[54:40] farther than the hand of God reached out
[54:42] and grabbed a hold of you because he
[54:44] said he'll have mercy on whom he will
[54:46] have mercy. And if he's had mercy on you
[54:48] tonight, I don't care, Amen, how many
[54:50] drugs or how much alcohol would try to
[54:53] invade your life. God can reach out into
[54:55] a barroom, amen, or a prostitute room
[54:57] and get a hold of a son or daughter of
[55:00] God and lift him up. Amen. Out of the
[55:02] deepest, darkest myy clay because of his
[55:05] great election over your life. Amen. He
[55:08] has mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[55:11] he chose Moses. And there was something
[55:13] brother Brandham would say something
[55:14] must have happened at his birth to
[55:16] signify these things. And even in one
[55:18] place he says how Amram his father Amen
[55:22] how he had a dream or a vision I think
[55:24] it was where an angel come down and
[55:26] pointed to the north and begin to
[55:27] describe what God would do through
[55:29] Moses's life. Amen. And it it and it
[55:33] reminds me and it's a great parallel of
[55:36] of our prophet when he come on the
[55:37] scene. Amen. There was a light that came
[55:39] in the room. remember how how those
[55:42] things were uh even the alignment of the
[55:44] constellations at the time of his birth
[55:47] signifying amen that this wasn't just
[55:49] another man but God was align God was uh
[55:53] Amen had brought amen the people to a
[55:55] junction where he was raising up a
[55:57] prophet amen for the appointed time for
[56:01] this
[56:02] exodus and so that's important to us
[56:04] because they recognized from his birth
[56:07] that he was a goodly child they
[56:08] recognized from his birth that God was
[56:11] had something in store for his life and
[56:13] that would be necessary for Jockabed
[56:16] because all of a sudden there come a
[56:18] decree from the government that every
[56:20] son or every baby must be cast into the
[56:22] river and in the river was crocodiles in
[56:25] the river was alligators in the river
[56:27] was uh uh whirlpools and scary things
[56:30] but brother Brandham as we spoke last
[56:32] time that there's three heads or three
[56:34] powers to Nexodus amen there's the power
[56:36] of Satan the power of faith and the
[56:38] power of God. Amen. And how the power of
[56:41] Satan usually always acts first,
[56:43] remember? And so here the power of Satan
[56:45] was trying to act first to cut off,
[56:47] Amen. what God was doing in this Exodus.
[56:50] But there's a greater power than the
[56:52] power of Satan. And it's the power of
[56:54] God and the power of faith. And Jockabed
[56:57] had the power of faith. And she began to
[56:59] exercise it because she knew that the
[57:02] Lord gave Moses to her. And if the Lord
[57:04] gave Moses to her, then the Lord was
[57:06] able to keep Moses and they could have
[57:09] confidence in the word spoken over his
[57:11] life because God had showed him by
[57:13] vision that he was going to raise up and
[57:15] be a mighty deliverer. But Jockabed knew
[57:18] that he couldn't get the training he
[57:19] needed in her household. So by faith she
[57:22] must release him into the river of
[57:23] death. Amen. That he might get proper
[57:26] training. Amen. In the palace of
[57:28] Pharaoh. And so she released him by
[57:30] faith having confidence in the word over
[57:32] his life. Just like Abraham had
[57:35] confidence when he would say, "I and the
[57:37] lad are I and the lad are going into the
[57:39] mountain to worship and I and the lad
[57:41] will return." Because if God gave Isaac
[57:44] to Abraham, Abraham knew that God was
[57:47] able to provide a sacrifice for Isaac. A
[57:50] and Jockabed didn't refuse to follow the
[57:53] command of the government, but she knew
[57:55] that she could put her baby in an ark
[57:58] covered with pitch or an atonement.
[58:00] Amen. that he could in that pitch an
[58:02] alligator would come up and sniff him
[58:04] and go away because of the smell of that
[58:06] tarpentine. Because he was covered in an
[58:08] atonement that he could sail through
[58:10] every water, through every whirlpool,
[58:12] through every scare and in every shadow
[58:15] that she could release him by faith into
[58:17] the river of death, knowing that there
[58:19] was a power of life that could take him
[58:21] out of the river and put him in the
[58:23] palace of Pharaoh. Oh, God had his hand
[58:26] upon Moses. And that gives us
[58:28] confidence. Amen. in this dark world as
[58:30] parents and grandparents. Amen. How can
[58:33] we release our children into a world of
[58:36] spiritual death? Amen. When there's
[58:38] mandates and government policies and
[58:40] amen, what if they make them, Amen, do
[58:42] this and what if they mandate that and
[58:44] if you're not careful to bring fear upon
[58:46] a mother's heart. Amen. But you can
[58:48] apply the same faith tonight that if God
[58:50] gave them to you, God's able to keep
[58:52] them. Amen. And he's given you promises
[58:55] in his word that if you train up a child
[58:57] in the way it should go, it will not
[58:59] depart from it. And if you believe, then
[59:01] not only you, but thy and thy house
[59:04] shall be saved. Amen. How do I release
[59:06] them? Amen. We we don't just follow
[59:08] traditions. Amen. When we have our
[59:10] babies come up to be dedicated in
[59:12] church. Amen. That is an act of faith. I
[59:15] mean, saying, "Lord, you gave them to me
[59:17] and I'm going to give them back to you
[59:20] because I know that I don't have the
[59:22] power to keep them." I mean, you can
[59:24] hide them in a closet. You can take them
[59:26] out in the desert and try to shelter
[59:28] them from every dark spirit. But unless
[59:30] they have a true experience with the
[59:32] Holy Ghost, I mean, they'll still be
[59:34] lost. Amen. But, Brother Brandon
[59:36] preaches a message in teaching on Moses,
[59:38] I believe it was, how he begins to lay
[59:40] out a principle that if you keep
[59:42] something, you lose it. And if you lose
[59:45] it, you keep it. Amen. And who has any
[59:48] greater power? Amen. Us and our humanity
[59:50] and our wisdom or the power of God. And
[59:53] he's letting us know that if you want to
[59:56] keep your life, then you need to lose
[59:58] it. Amen. And if you want to keep your
[1:00:00] children, you need to lose them into the
[1:00:02] hands of a God that's able to keep them.
[1:00:04] Amen. Through every trial, through every
[1:00:06] heartache, through every amen, dark
[1:00:09] valley. And a And sometimes it looks
[1:00:12] really dark. Sometimes it looks, I mean,
[1:00:15] you go through a real trial and it looks
[1:00:17] really dark. Amen. But the power of
[1:00:19] faith sees the sun shining behind the
[1:00:22] clouds and declares, amen, that that
[1:00:24] that there's still of God, amen, on the
[1:00:27] scene. Because time and sight are two of
[1:00:29] God's worst enemies. Amen. Brother
[1:00:31] Brandham said, Amen, that neither one
[1:00:33] declares anything about God. It's two of
[1:00:35] God's worst enemies. But the believer
[1:00:37] has a sixth sense and that's a sense of
[1:00:40] faith that in the darkest valley it can
[1:00:42] look through the clouds and say, "I know
[1:00:44] the sun is still shining beyond the
[1:00:47] clouds." And that's what Jockabed in the
[1:00:49] trial of her faith. She could look out
[1:00:51] and say, "I know the sun is still
[1:00:53] shining behind the clouds." Amen. And
[1:00:56] she began to exercise the power of faith
[1:00:58] until she could release that ark and it
[1:01:00] would float down the river and begin to
[1:01:02] bump into something. And what was it?
[1:01:05] There was Pharaoh's daughter out in the
[1:01:07] river. Amen. Bathing there in the pool.
[1:01:09] And the the the skeptic might say, "What
[1:01:11] are the odds that she would be standing
[1:01:13] there at that exact time?" Or, "What are
[1:01:15] the odds of this and what are the odds
[1:01:17] of that?" But the believer doesn't look
[1:01:19] at odds. The believer doesn't look at
[1:01:21] statistics. Amen. But the power of faith
[1:01:23] is not limited to statistics. Amen. But
[1:01:26] the power of faith says that God is in
[1:01:28] control. And God cannot God can guide an
[1:01:31] ark through a river. And God can guide
[1:01:34] my life. Amen. Through every decision,
[1:01:36] through every job, through every valley.
[1:01:38] Amen. It's the guiding hand of God that
[1:01:41] faith believes in. Amen. Because faith
[1:01:43] doesn't look at the odds. It doesn't
[1:01:45] look at the medical charts. But faith
[1:01:47] says if there's only one going in the
[1:01:49] rapture, then it's me. Amen. Faith says
[1:01:52] if there's only one family going to be
[1:01:54] under the blood, it's my family. Amen.
[1:01:57] If 999 people died with this disease,
[1:02:00] Amen. faith says, but the word says I'm
[1:02:03] healed. And so I don't care what the
[1:02:04] statistics say. Amen. I am healed. Amen.
[1:02:07] By the power of God. Oh, and that faith,
[1:02:11] Amen, took Moses out of that river and
[1:02:14] put him in the palace of Pharaoh and
[1:02:16] paid Jockabed $300 a week, Brother
[1:02:19] Brandham said, to take care of her own
[1:02:21] son. Amen. And not only that, but they
[1:02:24] were fed, Amen. perfectly. They were
[1:02:26] getting steaks and eggs and and
[1:02:28] biscuits. Amen. Every day. Amen.
[1:02:30] whatever they wanted. And this was one
[1:02:32] time that God put the wool over Satan's
[1:02:35] eyes and made Satan's instrument raise
[1:02:38] up God's instrument to destroy himself.
[1:02:41] Amen. It's the power of faith. Amen.
[1:02:43] That could pluck him out of the river
[1:02:45] and cause Satan to raise him up. Amen.
[1:02:48] To destroy his own armies. Amen. Oh,
[1:02:50] because I don't care what the
[1:02:52] circumstances look like, but the power
[1:02:54] of faith overrides the circumstances.
[1:02:57] Because faith doesn't look at
[1:02:58] circumstances, but faith looks at one
[1:03:00] thing and that's God said so and that
[1:03:03] settles it. Oh, brother Brandham said
[1:03:06] that God can alter circumstances. He can
[1:03:09] make the impossible become a probable
[1:03:11] and not only probable but can make it a
[1:03:14] reality. Oh, glory to God. Brother Bram
[1:03:17] said, "Perfect faith is a master of all
[1:03:20] circumstances. It masters circumstances.
[1:03:23] No matter what it is, it masters it."
[1:03:25] Brother Brham said, "Faith believes that
[1:03:27] God will work it out." And brother
[1:03:29] Brandham said, "In the fundamental
[1:03:30] foundation for faith, you were born here
[1:03:33] to control all
[1:03:34] circumstances." Oh my. Faith controls
[1:03:37] circumstances. Circumstances don't
[1:03:40] control faith. Amen. And sometimes you
[1:03:42] got to get to that point in your life
[1:03:44] where you stop letting circumstances
[1:03:46] control you and you start controlling
[1:03:48] the circumstances. Amen. You are amateur
[1:03:51] gods, are you not? Amen. Weren't you
[1:03:54] born here to control circumstances? I
[1:03:56] mean, weren't you born here to have
[1:03:58] dominion over the flesh, over sin, and
[1:04:00] over the devil? You were not born here
[1:04:02] in this earth as a son or daughter of
[1:04:04] God. Amen. To live under the dominion.
[1:04:07] Amen. Of the power of the devil, but you
[1:04:09] were born here to control the
[1:04:11] circumstances with the power of faith.
[1:04:14] Amen. And if you'll just not fear the
[1:04:16] circumstances and just exercise your
[1:04:18] faith, you can actually control the
[1:04:21] circumstances. Amen. Uh it's a principle
[1:04:23] that brother Brandon brings out. He said
[1:04:25] that mother when she's cooking over that
[1:04:27] hot stove, if that oil pops out and
[1:04:29] burns her, he said if she'll rush for
[1:04:31] that ointment, then it'll burn her. But
[1:04:33] he said if she just won't fear, it won't
[1:04:35] hurt her. He said it's actually the
[1:04:38] scare that brings on the burn. Amen.
[1:04:41] That that might boggle our natural mind,
[1:04:43] but I got a quote for it. And then next
[1:04:45] he moves to Paul with the snake that bit
[1:04:47] his hand. And he said Paul didn't fear
[1:04:49] it. He just shook it off in the fire.
[1:04:52] and the circumstances couldn't hurt Paul
[1:04:54] because Paul didn't fear the
[1:04:56] circumstances. And then he moves to
[1:04:57] Peter walking on the water. And Peter
[1:05:00] defied circumstances when he walked on
[1:05:02] the water. And the only time he sunk
[1:05:04] Paul was when fear came in and he begins
[1:05:06] to sink beneath the waves. Amen. But
[1:05:08] when faith could be restored, it could
[1:05:10] bring him back out from the waves and
[1:05:12] set him on top of the water. Amen.
[1:05:14] Because there's two powers trying to
[1:05:16] control your soul. It's the power of
[1:05:18] unbelief and the power of faith. Those
[1:05:20] two powers are at war. But tonight,
[1:05:22] there's a power of faith, amen, that can
[1:05:25] refuse to fear the circumstances and
[1:05:27] gain dominion, amen, over the trial that
[1:05:30] you're going through. Amen. You've not
[1:05:32] been given the spirit of fear, but of
[1:05:34] power and of love and of a sound mind.
[1:05:36] And if you just don't fear, oh, you can
[1:05:39] control. Amen. The the atmospheres that
[1:05:41] you live in tonight as a son or daughter
[1:05:44] of God. I I I think of those things
[1:05:47] either. I looked up that phrase, fear
[1:05:50] can, and it had no results because fear
[1:05:53] can't do anything for you. Amen. Brother
[1:05:56] Brandham say, if I was going to go
[1:05:57] before the firing squad in the morning,
[1:05:59] Amen. then what good would fear do for
[1:06:01] me? But faith can sign my pardon. Amen.
[1:06:04] Fear can't do nothing. But what can
[1:06:06] faith do? Faith can deliver you. Faith
[1:06:09] can set you free. Faith can sign your
[1:06:11] pardon. Amen. I think of our own
[1:06:13] testimony of our family a couple years
[1:06:15] ago. Amen. Before we had Spencer, we had
[1:06:18] a a youth camp and and and Bethany was
[1:06:20] had a desire in her heart, thinking of
[1:06:22] what should she ask for going into this
[1:06:24] prayer line and she just began to think
[1:06:27] and she just began to lay on her heart
[1:06:29] that she had a cousin out there in
[1:06:31] Arkansas and and was out in the world
[1:06:33] and wasn't doing good at all. And and
[1:06:35] then the other thing she was desiring
[1:06:37] was a baby uh because we hadn't had the
[1:06:39] baby yet and she was maybe beginning to
[1:06:41] build up a little bit of fear that maybe
[1:06:43] we would have trouble and been trying to
[1:06:45] have this baby. And so she just took
[1:06:47] those things before the Lord in that
[1:06:48] prayer line. And as she went through
[1:06:50] that prayer line, the power of God began
[1:06:52] to fall in the prayer line. And they
[1:06:54] they took her out to that other room.
[1:06:56] And there in that prayer room, something
[1:06:58] just began to flash before her mind. And
[1:07:00] she saw something out in front of her.
[1:07:02] And it was her cousin holding a little
[1:07:04] baby boy in a blanket. And you know
[1:07:06] what? It was a year later at that exact
[1:07:08] same camp. She's standing there taking a
[1:07:11] picture and all of a sudden it hits her
[1:07:12] that there's her cousin that was out in
[1:07:14] the world holding a baby boy in a blue
[1:07:16] blanket. Amen. Because the power of
[1:07:18] faith doesn't bow down to fear and
[1:07:20] failure. The power of faith doesn't bow
[1:07:22] down to the circumstances, but faith
[1:07:24] says I serve a God. Amen. Where there is
[1:07:27] no way, he can make a way. Amen. Where
[1:07:29] there's a mountain, he can make a plane.
[1:07:31] Where there's a valley, he can lift me
[1:07:33] up and set me back on my feet and give
[1:07:35] me the desire of my heart. Amen. What
[1:07:37] about Ron Spencer who's been battling
[1:07:39] cancer for 5 years and not only is he
[1:07:42] still here but he just got a clear brain
[1:07:44] scan. Amen. Because a power of faith,
[1:07:46] amen, can keep a believer. Amen. Not
[1:07:49] only keep him alive, Amen. But Amen.
[1:07:51] They can have dominion over the kingdom
[1:07:53] of Satan. Oh, and bring terror to the
[1:07:55] devil. Brother Brandham said that he's
[1:07:57] beginning to say how he talked to a
[1:07:59] doctor. And he says if if somebody's
[1:08:01] described or or or if they're uh given a
[1:08:05] diagnosis of a real terrible disease, he
[1:08:07] said usually if the person fears that
[1:08:09] thing, he said it'll almost instantly
[1:08:12] kill them. But he said if you have a
[1:08:13] believer or someone who's not scared to
[1:08:15] die, he said it'll almost that
[1:08:18] case every time and they can live for
[1:08:20] years and years. Oh, but brother
[1:08:23] Brandham said this. He said, "Now what
[1:08:24] if your frustrations will hold that up
[1:08:27] there and your one conscience will drop
[1:08:29] it down and make your body function
[1:08:31] right? What will it do when you let the
[1:08:33] Holy Spirit roll in?" He said, "It will
[1:08:36] perform everything that Christ promised.
[1:08:38] You become an instrument of the Holy
[1:08:40] Spirit." Amen. Amen. Fear, Amen, will
[1:08:43] cause that thing to have dominion over
[1:08:45] you. Amen. In the first conscience will
[1:08:47] almost the case. But he said when
[1:08:49] the Holy Ghost rolls in, I mean, it can
[1:08:51] take it completely away. Amen. It's the
[1:08:54] power of faith, friends. It It's a
[1:08:56] greater power than the power of death.
[1:08:59] Amen. Didn't Didn't Satan, Amen, have to
[1:09:02] give over, Amen, control to the Lord
[1:09:05] when he said, Amen mean that that that
[1:09:07] Job was a servant and he wanted to test
[1:09:10] Job and give him trials. But the Lord
[1:09:12] put him on a leash and said, "Satan,
[1:09:14] Amen, you can touch him, his family, and
[1:09:17] you can touch his home, but whatever you
[1:09:19] do, don't touch his life." Amen. Because
[1:09:21] the power of life, Amen, is so powerful.
[1:09:24] Amen. That the power of death, that's
[1:09:26] Satan's power, Amen. There's three
[1:09:28] powers, right? Satan's power is the
[1:09:29] power of death. Amen. But his power is
[1:09:32] only given in God's appointed season.
[1:09:35] Amen. And he can only use it when God
[1:09:37] allows him to use it. Amen. Satan's only
[1:09:40] power. And brother Brand said God hooked
[1:09:42] it up to a buggy. Amen. That that the
[1:09:45] only time that he can use it is when God
[1:09:48] says, "Amen, it's time for that believer
[1:09:50] to go home." And it only carries you
[1:09:52] into the presence of your maker. Oh, he
[1:09:55] can't touch a hair on your head without
[1:09:57] God's permission. And if God allows it,
[1:09:59] it must be for your good. And if God's
[1:10:02] ready to take us home, then we're ready
[1:10:04] to go. But Satan can't do it until God
[1:10:06] gives him permission. Amen. because he
[1:10:09] has no power. The Bible says in Hebrews
[1:10:12] 2, for as much then as the children are
[1:10:15] partakers of flesh and blood, he also
[1:10:17] himself likewise took part of the same,
[1:10:20] that through death he might destroy him
[1:10:23] that had the power of death. That is the
[1:10:26] devil. And deliver them who through fear
[1:10:28] of death were all their lifetime subject
[1:10:31] to bondage. I mean, wouldn't Job say,
[1:10:34] "If a man die, shall he live again?"
[1:10:37] Amen. Even our prophet, he wasn't scared
[1:10:39] of death. Amen. But he was wondering,
[1:10:41] "What will it be like when we cross
[1:10:42] over? I I don't want to be just floating
[1:10:45] around like a spirit." But God in his
[1:10:47] infinite mercy. Amen. 2,000 years ago,
[1:10:50] he came on the cross and the power of
[1:10:53] life was hung on a wooden tree that he
[1:10:56] might destroy him who has the power of
[1:10:58] death. That he might deliver those who
[1:11:01] all their lifetime were under the
[1:11:03] bondage of the fear of death. and let a
[1:11:06] people know, amen, that you don't have
[1:11:08] to fear death because he showed Job
[1:11:11] Easter. He said, "Job," Amen. the flower
[1:11:13] goes into the ground and it comes up
[1:11:15] again. Amen. And Job wondered, "But what
[1:11:18] about man?" And God showed him Easter.
[1:11:21] And Job cried out in Revelation, "Yet in
[1:11:23] my flesh shall I see God." Amen. Because
[1:11:26] the power of death was destroyed at
[1:11:29] Calvary 2,000 years ago. Amen. tomorrow
[1:11:32] on Good Friday when he died on the
[1:11:34] cross. He took the keys of death, hell,
[1:11:36] and grave out of the hands of Satan and
[1:11:38] says, "Satan, you only have one power.
[1:11:41] And now I am stripping you of your power
[1:11:43] and I will control it the rest of your
[1:11:45] days. And you will not be able to
[1:11:47] torment my believing children. But in a
[1:11:49] few days on the day of Pentecost, I'm
[1:11:52] going to send back a power upon their
[1:11:54] lives. And it'll not be a power of
[1:11:56] death, but it'll be resurrection power."
[1:11:58] Amen. Oh, look at that man. He said, "If
[1:12:01] you destroy this temple in three days,
[1:12:03] I'll raise it up again." And then he
[1:12:05] sent that same power in a bride. And
[1:12:07] said, "Satan, you can't destroy her. You
[1:12:10] can't destroy. There's not enough atomic
[1:12:12] power. There's not enough cancer.
[1:12:14] There's not enough diabetes and to
[1:12:16] destroy the quickening power of the Holy
[1:12:18] Spirit." Oh, the same quickening power
[1:12:21] that quickened your spirit to this word
[1:12:24] can also quicken your mortal body. Oh,
[1:12:27] it's already been tested on the first
[1:12:29] Easter. He tested it and said it works.
[1:12:32] And he sent it back upon a church and
[1:12:34] said, "As I live, ye shall live also."
[1:12:37] Amen. Amen. What a resurrection that
[1:12:39] was. But what a resurrection this is
[1:12:41] when a bride has caught a hold of the
[1:12:43] same resurrection power. And it's loosed
[1:12:46] you. Amen. And it's caused you to
[1:12:48] recognize, Amen, that you don't have to
[1:12:50] fear any power the devil has any longer.
[1:12:53] You can be loosed from every bondage and
[1:12:56] gain dominion o over every
[1:13:00] spirit. Oh my, what a powerful thing he
[1:13:02] did for us, friends. What a power, the
[1:13:05] power of the life of God that's been
[1:13:08] released into the church tonight. Amen.
[1:13:10] That's what we're depending on. You see,
[1:13:12] Moses, I mean, one day he looked out of
[1:13:15] that window, the same window that
[1:13:16] Pharaoh looked out of, and by faith he
[1:13:20] chose to be counted not with the kingdom
[1:13:23] of of Egypt, but with the mudbers and
[1:13:26] the children of Israel. He chose to
[1:13:29] become one of them. Amen. That's why
[1:13:31] brother Brandham left the Baptist
[1:13:32] church. He saw that group that was
[1:13:35] rejected and laughed at and he said, "I
[1:13:37] I'll become one of them." And by faith
[1:13:40] he left the church and become one of
[1:13:42] them. One of those holy rollers, one of
[1:13:44] those spiritfilled. Amen. And Moses
[1:13:46] looked out and said, "I'll become one of
[1:13:48] them." But what did he do? He seen one
[1:13:50] of his fellow Israelites being a mean
[1:13:54] attacked or tormented by an Egyptian
[1:13:57] soldier and he got in the flesh and he
[1:13:59] went out and killed that Egyptian
[1:14:01] soldier. Amen. Because he got in the
[1:14:04] flesh and that death became a shame to
[1:14:06] him. And brother Brandham said, "That's
[1:14:08] what we've got from these so-called
[1:14:09] revivals. It's just a bunch of dead
[1:14:12] church members." Amen. 40 years of
[1:14:14] training in the palace of Pharaoh. Amen.
[1:14:17] Produced one dead Egyptian. Amen. And it
[1:14:19] wasn't so much the death of the Egyptian
[1:14:21] because when he got in the spirit, he
[1:14:24] would destroy a whole army and it would
[1:14:25] be a glory unto him. But he got in the
[1:14:28] flesh and it became a failure. Because
[1:14:31] failure of intellectual religion, it's
[1:14:33] always been a failure. The failure of
[1:14:35] religion without a true experience has
[1:14:38] always been a failure. It's never been
[1:14:40] able to produce what God is looking for.
[1:14:43] It's the failure of human ability. Amen.
[1:14:46] But oh, Amen. God's strength is made
[1:14:48] perfect in weakness if you can just
[1:14:50] recognize that you can't do it in
[1:14:52] yourself. Amen. And that there requires
[1:14:55] a greater power. Moses recognized he
[1:14:58] could not deliver them by knowledge or
[1:15:01] by theology. And brother Brandham said,
[1:15:03] "God today is not going to deliver his
[1:15:06] people by education. He never promised
[1:15:09] to do it." He said, "He's not going to
[1:15:12] deliver them by theology. He never
[1:15:14] promised to do it. He's not going to
[1:15:16] deliver them by science. He never
[1:15:18] promised to do it. He's not going to
[1:15:20] deliver them by denomination. He never
[1:15:22] promised to do it. But he will deliver
[1:15:25] them." Oh, I'm thankful for a way of
[1:15:28] escape. He said he will deliver them by
[1:15:30] the power, supernatural power of
[1:15:33] changing their lives and molding them
[1:15:35] into the children of God. Oh, that's
[1:15:38] God's provided way of escape. He won't
[1:15:40] do it by theology. He won't do it by
[1:15:43] denomination or churchity, but he will
[1:15:45] do it by the power of transformation.
[1:15:49] That he will transform a life. Amen. By
[1:15:52] his power and make it a new creature in
[1:15:54] Christ Jesus. That is God's power of
[1:15:57] deliverance. Amen. He don't do it by
[1:16:00] theology. And not only does he not do it
[1:16:02] by theology, amen, brother Ben. But in
[1:16:04] fact, the prophet said that God hates a
[1:16:07] powerless religion. God wants to perform
[1:16:10] his word by his power. Amen. But the
[1:16:13] church wants to operate through creeds.
[1:16:15] And how can those two operate together?
[1:16:18] And they can't. And that's why they've
[1:16:20] went on without the Lord. Amen. And
[1:16:22] they're not operating. Amen. All they're
[1:16:24] producing is a bunch of dead Egyptian.
[1:16:26] But God, I mean, he hates the powerless
[1:16:29] religion. But he wants to perform his
[1:16:31] word, not through creeds, but through
[1:16:33] power. I mean, the wheels of God's power
[1:16:36] are trying to turn and but the church
[1:16:39] has locked them up with a bunch of muck
[1:16:41] of sin and watered down religion. But if
[1:16:43] that wheel can just be washed by the
[1:16:46] water of the word, then it can start to
[1:16:48] turn again. And it's turning tonight in
[1:16:50] a pride who says, "Amen. We will not
[1:16:53] limit you, Amen, to a bunch of of just
[1:16:57] churchity. We will not limit you to a
[1:16:59] bunch of theology." Amen. But if you are
[1:17:02] God, let God be God. Like they said on
[1:17:05] Mount Carmel, Amen. If he be God, Amen.
[1:17:08] then let him be God. The one who answers
[1:17:11] by fire. That's the God that will
[1:17:13] follow. And that's what I say tonight.
[1:17:15] The one who answers by fire, that's the
[1:17:18] God that I want to follow. The one who
[1:17:20] answers by power, that's the one I want
[1:17:23] to follow. Oh, I sometimes I feel like
[1:17:26] those children of Israel in that fiery
[1:17:28] furnace, they said, "Our God is able to
[1:17:31] deliver us, but even if he doesn't, we
[1:17:34] will not bow." Amen. Even if he doesn't,
[1:17:37] we will not bow. Amen. Even if God chose
[1:17:39] to left me here on this earth to go
[1:17:42] through the judgment, I've seen enough
[1:17:44] of the power of God to say, "Satan, I
[1:17:46] will not bow to a halfway religion. I
[1:17:48] will not bow to a bunch of cold formal
[1:17:51] worship. I will not bow." Amen. To just
[1:17:54] binding our young people, amen, to a
[1:17:56] 10-step program for deliverance. That's
[1:17:58] not God's program. But God's program is
[1:18:00] to let the power of God, Amen, come into
[1:18:03] the house of God. Oh, there's there's
[1:18:05] plenty of churches who have a form of
[1:18:07] godliness and deny the power thereof.
[1:18:09] Amen. But they're like those
[1:18:11] uncircumcised Egyptians who try to
[1:18:13] follow the children of Israel through
[1:18:15] the Red Sea. They didn't make it because
[1:18:17] they didn't have the goods. Amen. But
[1:18:19] the power of the Exodus comes from the
[1:18:23] power of the Holy Ghost. And so we will
[1:18:25] not deny the power of God. Amen. But
[1:18:28] like Rebecca, we are going to water the
[1:18:31] very power that's going to take us out
[1:18:33] of here. Oh, I say there's only one
[1:18:36] power to take a bride in a rapture.
[1:18:38] There's only one power that could call a
[1:18:40] bride out of the systems and it's a
[1:18:43] spiritual power under a prophet. Amen.
[1:18:45] And if you get in the waters of those
[1:18:47] powers and they can carry you like John
[1:18:50] Ryan could cry out, I'm riding on it.
[1:18:53] I'm riding on it. That's what the bride
[1:18:54] is doing tonight. Amen. They went off
[1:18:57] the the log of ecclesiastism. Amen.
[1:19:00] Because that log was heading to death,
[1:19:02] but they got on the log of the
[1:19:03] vindicated word and they said, "I'm
[1:19:05] writing on it." Amen. This is the power.
[1:19:07] Amen. That's going to take us into a
[1:19:09] rapture. This is the power that's going
[1:19:11] to change our bodies. Amen. It's the
[1:19:13] power of God. Amen. Doesn't the Bible
[1:19:16] say quench not the spirit and despise
[1:19:19] not prophesyings? Oh, don't quench the
[1:19:21] power. Water the power. Oh, but I'll
[1:19:25] tell you this. Amen. Putting the power
[1:19:27] in order in the church is not quenching
[1:19:29] it. Amen. Placing it in its rightful
[1:19:32] position is not the same as quenching
[1:19:34] it. But brother Brandham taught the
[1:19:36] gifts in order. And then he said, "If
[1:19:38] you want to see, A, if you put it in
[1:19:40] that kind of order, watch what Pentecost
[1:19:42] rises to." Amen. He didn't say, "Watch
[1:19:44] what that thing will diminish to." He
[1:19:46] said, "If you put it in order, watch
[1:19:48] what it rises to." Amen. Because this
[1:19:50] message didn't quench the power of the
[1:19:53] Pentecostal age, but it put it in order.
[1:19:56] Amen. Because they were blowing all the
[1:19:58] power off as steam. Amen. But when it
[1:20:00] came under a prophet's message, he put
[1:20:03] it in order. Amen. That it wouldn't all
[1:20:05] blow off at steam, but that it would go
[1:20:07] to work. Oh my. Amen. That power is in
[1:20:11] the church tonight. Amen. But it's
[1:20:13] channeled in a bride. It's not being all
[1:20:16] blown off, but it's been put in earthn
[1:20:18] vessels and it's gone to work. Amen.
[1:20:21] Putting a bride in her adoption seat.
[1:20:24] And it's that power that will change
[1:20:26] your body. Oh, quench it not. Oh, but
[1:20:29] water it. We won't sell out our
[1:20:33] birthright. Amen. For a mess of pottage.
[1:20:36] Amen. I have I I I'm a young man, a very
[1:20:40] young man in this in this word. But I've
[1:20:42] come far enough to know there is only
[1:20:44] one power that's going to perform this
[1:20:46] Exodus. Amen. And it's the power of God.
[1:20:51] It's the power of the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:20:54] the power of this word. A and and when
[1:20:57] Moses, Amen, went under another power,
[1:21:00] the people feared him. And they feared
[1:21:02] the deliverer, the very one that they
[1:21:04] were supposed to believe in reverence.
[1:21:07] They feared him and and and and and so
[1:21:09] much that God was ready and Moses was
[1:21:12] ready, but the people weren't ready. And
[1:21:14] they had to wait another generation to
[1:21:16] come out while Moses was out in the
[1:21:18] wilderness. And there they've been there
[1:21:21] 400 years, but they had to wait 440
[1:21:23] years. Amen. While God, I mean, had his
[1:21:26] prophet out in the wilderness. and and
[1:21:28] and brother Brandon would speak to us on
[1:21:30] these things about how when that that
[1:21:32] spirit was walking out on the water to
[1:21:34] those disciples, they would say, you
[1:21:36] know, they they they would get afraid.
[1:21:39] Amen. But you're all familiar with the
[1:21:40] sermon and he would speak out, "It is I.
[1:21:43] Be not afraid." Amen. That spirit that
[1:21:46] the world looked at and called
[1:21:48] fanaticism and heresy and holy rollers.
[1:21:51] Amen. But a prophet would preach. Amen.
[1:21:53] And I don't believe he was just
[1:21:54] preaching about 2,000 years ago, but he
[1:21:56] was preaching about his message that the
[1:21:58] people would make fun of and laugh at.
[1:22:00] And he's saying, "It's him. Don't fear
[1:22:02] it. It's him. It's I It's the only help
[1:22:06] of that you have for your deliverance."
[1:22:08] He's saying you're they they feared the
[1:22:11] only thing that was able to deliver
[1:22:12] them, the only thing that was able to
[1:22:14] help them. A and they get so afraid of
[1:22:17] of the fanaticism until they fear the
[1:22:20] very deliverer. Amen. And that's why I
[1:22:23] mean when Janice and Jambers come on the
[1:22:25] scene, they come to impersonate the true
[1:22:28] gift of God of the hour. Amen. And they
[1:22:31] were sent there. Amen. To throw the
[1:22:33] people off the track. They were sent
[1:22:35] there to try to get the the the people
[1:22:38] to look at the wrong thing. Amen. But
[1:22:40] the scripture would say, "Don't fear
[1:22:42] them. Their folly will be made manifest.
[1:22:45] And if somebody calls himself a prophet
[1:22:47] and what they say doesn't come to pass,
[1:22:49] don't fear that man because he's not a
[1:22:52] true prophet, his folly will be made
[1:22:54] known. Amen. So that's why the believer,
[1:22:56] you're not meant to focus on the
[1:22:58] impersonators. Amen. That have come in
[1:23:00] this age because the Bible said they
[1:23:02] would come as Janice and Jambas withtood
[1:23:05] Moses. So these men would rise up having
[1:23:08] a form of godliness to try to withstand
[1:23:10] the the true message of God. Amen. But
[1:23:12] if you'll just get your eyes off that,
[1:23:14] that's only a proof that there's a
[1:23:16] genuine article. Oh my. And the believer
[1:23:20] looks to the message and says, "That is
[1:23:22] the genuine article of God." Amen. That
[1:23:26] stood in the midst of every Janice and
[1:23:28] Jambress and withtood the test. Oh, even
[1:23:32] at that man that would try to come in
[1:23:33] the line and and write the wrong thing
[1:23:36] on his prayer line. Amen. Trying to
[1:23:38] withstand, Amen. the Moses of our day.
[1:23:40] If I could say that. But when he tried
[1:23:42] to do it, amen, the very sickness that
[1:23:44] he wrote on the card came upon him
[1:23:46] because the spirit, amen, that was
[1:23:48] within the prophet. Amen. Brother
[1:23:50] Brandon would have never known that.
[1:23:51] Amen. But there was a spirit, amen, that
[1:23:54] was on the scene that was a greater
[1:23:56] power. Oh my, than every critic that
[1:23:59] could say you don't have that disease.
[1:24:01] Amen. But now you do have it. Oh my.
[1:24:04] It's the prevailing power over every
[1:24:06] critic, over every
[1:24:09] impersonator. Oh, don't fear it. Don't
[1:24:11] look to him. Look to that message and
[1:24:13] move forward. Amen. There, that runaway
[1:24:16] prophet ended up out in the wilderness.
[1:24:18] And there he was. And he married a wife
[1:24:21] and he had children and he began to
[1:24:23] settle down to just raising sheep.
[1:24:26] Brother Brian, there he was out in the
[1:24:28] wilderness just raising sheep, just
[1:24:29] going about his life. Amen. But he
[1:24:32] didn't forget those things. He began to
[1:24:34] wander. And as he walked out there with
[1:24:36] those sheep out in that that wilderness,
[1:24:39] he's walking and brother Brandham talks
[1:24:42] about how those crystal tears begin to
[1:24:44] run down his face. There he is, a man 80
[1:24:46] years old. He's he supposedly to his
[1:24:50] mind, he's probably wasted in 40 years
[1:24:53] or 80 years of his life. He disobeyed
[1:24:56] the Lord. He missed his calling. He's
[1:24:58] out in the wilderness. This is what his
[1:25:00] life has amounted to. Amen. But while
[1:25:03] he's out in the wilderness, the cries of
[1:25:06] Egypt are coming up to the throne of
[1:25:07] God. And God is remembering his
[1:25:10] covenant. And Moses feels like he's
[1:25:12] missed his calling. But but brother
[1:25:14] Brandon would begin to say, you know,
[1:25:16] that they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:25:18] renew their strength. A and you may feel
[1:25:21] like a failure. Amen. You might be 80
[1:25:23] years old. Amen. But it's not too late
[1:25:25] to start serving the Lord. And he begins
[1:25:28] to, you
[1:25:29] know, like we spoke earlier, if you're
[1:25:32] hungering after the Holy Ghost, you'll
[1:25:34] be miserable. Amen. Until you, Amen,
[1:25:36] heed to the call. And if God's calling
[1:25:38] you, Amen, to to a position, you'll be
[1:25:41] miserable until you heed the call. But
[1:25:43] God had ordained Moses for the position.
[1:25:46] And there was nothing that could stop
[1:25:48] Moses, Amen, from coming to his
[1:25:50] position. Amen. I if God had to, he
[1:25:53] could raise up rocks, Amen, to cry out.
[1:25:57] He could have the trees preach his
[1:25:58] gospel. Amen. But he didn't need him
[1:26:00] because he had a prophet on the scene.
[1:26:04] Oh my. So there Moses is down by Mount
[1:26:06] Horeb and God sends down a pillar of
[1:26:10] fire. And that pillar of fire begins to
[1:26:13] begins to move through the trees and
[1:26:15] move through the bushes. And all of a
[1:26:18] sudden it settles down in a bush. And
[1:26:21] Moses hurting his sheep looks over and
[1:26:24] it attracts his attention.
[1:26:26] Amen. And Moses turned from his regular
[1:26:29] routine of hurting sheep to walk down
[1:26:32] another path. Amen. Towards a pillar of
[1:26:34] fire. And it changed Moses when he did
[1:26:37] that. Amen. Just like it changed Mary
[1:26:40] when she went from a regular path to the
[1:26:42] water pot in the well to turn down a
[1:26:45] path where the angel Gabriel was
[1:26:47] standing there whirling and was going to
[1:26:49] give her a commission. Amen. To birth
[1:26:51] Jesus. And just like it changed you when
[1:26:54] you turned down the path and mean you
[1:26:56] you've maybe thought you were just here
[1:26:58] to be an electrician or a plumber or a
[1:27:00] carpenter one day and the light of this
[1:27:03] message begin to attract your attention
[1:27:05] and you begin to turn aside and look at
[1:27:08] that light and that light begin to call
[1:27:10] you by name and say Brian Paul. Amen.
[1:27:14] David and begin to call you by name and
[1:27:16] it begin to call you into a conference
[1:27:18] with the pillar of fire. Amen. and you
[1:27:21] begin to humble yourself and take off
[1:27:23] your shoes and begin to commune with the
[1:27:26] Lord just like Moses did in that
[1:27:29] presence of that pillar of fire. Amen.
[1:27:31] And in five minutes, Amen. that pillar
[1:27:33] of fire had what Moses lacked in 5
[1:27:35] minutes. He got more than he got in 40
[1:27:38] years in the palace of Pharaoh and 40
[1:27:41] years in the wilderness. 5 minutes in
[1:27:44] the presence of the burning bush. Amen.
[1:27:46] And all doubt begin to fall away. Amen.
[1:27:49] And what Moses had been taught by his
[1:27:50] mother laid in his mind in an
[1:27:53] intellectual faith. But in the presence
[1:27:55] of that pillar of fire, it took that
[1:27:57] word and brought it to a reality. I
[1:27:59] mean, the gasoline, if I could say it,
[1:28:02] was there the whole time. But when life
[1:28:04] came on the gasoline, it proved that
[1:28:06] Moses was the true prophet for that
[1:28:09] hour. I mean, so did the gasoline lay in
[1:28:12] the bride of Jesus Christ. But you
[1:28:14] couldn't prove it was gasoline just cuz
[1:28:16] it was in a gasoline can. It might be
[1:28:19] water. Amen. But the way to prove if it
[1:28:21] was gasoline was to put, Amen, a match
[1:28:23] inside. Oh, and when God sent the life
[1:28:26] on this bride, it proved that you are
[1:28:29] the true bride. It proved that you are
[1:28:31] the one, Amen, that we've been looking
[1:28:33] for. You are the one that the prophets
[1:28:35] have spoke of. You are the one, Amen,
[1:28:38] that time has been waiting for the
[1:28:40] manifestation of the sons of God. And
[1:28:43] when the life of this message waved
[1:28:45] across you, amen, you begin to come
[1:28:47] forth in resurrection power proving,
[1:28:51] amen, that you are the bride. Oh, every
[1:28:54] intellectual thought you ever had of
[1:28:56] this message, every quote you ever
[1:28:58] memorized, oh, when you got in the
[1:29:00] presence of that burning bush, it began
[1:29:02] to come to life and you begin to
[1:29:05] recognize that wasn't just a quote about
[1:29:07] somebody else. That's a quote about me.
[1:29:09] I am that bride. I am that one. I am the
[1:29:13] one that's sent here to fulfill this
[1:29:15] scripture and that scripture. And these
[1:29:17] things begin to come to life. Oh, and
[1:29:19] after that time, Moses could no longer
[1:29:21] be shaken. Oh, he never returned to that
[1:29:24] bush again. Amen. I in that same
[1:29:27] condition. But, Amen, he was under a new
[1:29:29] anointing. He had been in a conference
[1:29:33] where he received a commission. Amen.
[1:29:36] That he was sent to deliver the children
[1:29:38] of Israel. He could no longer be shaken.
[1:29:41] Amen. And that's a problem today with so
[1:29:44] many that walk away from this message.
[1:29:46] It's that they never spent the five
[1:29:48] minutes in the burning bush. They never
[1:29:50] stayed on those sacred sands. They got
[1:29:52] the intellectual faith and that's as far
[1:29:53] as they went. Amen. But if you ever go
[1:29:56] into the presence of that bush, it'll
[1:29:58] tie an absolute around your life. Amen.
[1:30:01] that no matter how many critics come, no
[1:30:04] matter how many Janice and Jambers come,
[1:30:07] no matter how many other voices come,
[1:30:10] that absolute will hold you. Amen. It'll
[1:30:13] hold you in the middle of trial like it
[1:30:16] held brother Brandham when he lost his
[1:30:18] mother and his daughter. Amen. That
[1:30:20] light was there and it held him through
[1:30:22] his deepest trials. Brother Brandham
[1:30:25] could say when that when that voice
[1:30:26] would begin to speak out to him that he
[1:30:28] should just give up. If this is all God
[1:30:30] can do for him after spending his whole
[1:30:32] life praying for the sick, he should
[1:30:34] just give up. Amen. But there come forth
[1:30:36] out of that light and his being a
[1:30:38] another voice that said no, the Lord
[1:30:41] gives and the Lord takes away and
[1:30:43] blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, the
[1:30:46] light had a voice and that voice began
[1:30:49] to commune with a prophet and it be to
[1:30:51] tell him, amen, that he was Moses and
[1:30:54] that, Amen, that he was going to use him
[1:30:56] to deliver the children of Israel. And
[1:30:58] Moses had maybe seen a lot of fire and
[1:31:01] heard a lot of voices, but this was a
[1:31:03] scriptural voice. It begin to speak out,
[1:31:05] I've heard the cries of my people. And I
[1:31:08] remember my covenant. And Moses
[1:31:10] recognized that that was a scriptural
[1:31:11] voice. And Moses Moses didn't just leave
[1:31:14] there saying, "Oh, I seen a fire. The
[1:31:17] fire burned bright. It was a beautiful
[1:31:19] fire." But Moses left there having
[1:31:21] talked to a voice. And oh my, that's
[1:31:24] what some people, that's the only thing
[1:31:25] they got out of this message was the
[1:31:27] first pole and the second pole. But they
[1:31:30] failed to listen, amen, to the voice of
[1:31:32] that third pole. Amen. That would speak
[1:31:34] out the revelation of this end time
[1:31:36] word. Amen. And it would be a voice,
[1:31:39] amen, that would call a bride out of a
[1:31:41] church. Amen. And the bride didn't just
[1:31:43] recognize the sign of Sodom, but the
[1:31:45] bride heard the Malachi voice and it was
[1:31:48] a scriptural voice and it was calling
[1:31:50] you, come out and revealing to you the
[1:31:52] great mysteries of this word. Oh my, it
[1:31:55] was a scriptural voice and it began to
[1:31:57] speak to you, I am that I am. Amen. When
[1:32:00] that light identified itself to Moses,
[1:32:02] it spoke that he was the I am. Amen.
[1:32:05] When Jesus was on the earth, Amen. And
[1:32:08] John was there with him at the Jordan
[1:32:09] River. Amen. He said, "Upon whom thou
[1:32:11] see the spirit of the Lord descending
[1:32:13] upon?" That would be the lamb of God.
[1:32:15] And John seen it coming down like a
[1:32:17] dove. And said, "Behold the lamb of
[1:32:19] God." Amen. Because Jesus could say, "I
[1:32:21] came from God and I'm going back to God.
[1:32:24] I came from the pillar of fire and I'm
[1:32:26] going back to the pillar of fire." And
[1:32:28] they could say, "Amen. How do you know
[1:32:30] Abraham?" And he would say, "Before
[1:32:32] Abraham was, I am." And he say, "How do
[1:32:35] you know Moses?" He could say, "I was
[1:32:37] the one that spoke to Moses." in the
[1:32:40] burning bush. I was the one that stood
[1:32:42] there. Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:32:45] Jesus of the New. And the pillar of fire
[1:32:47] had took on flesh. And the man Christ
[1:32:49] Jesus. Oh, the same one that was in this
[1:32:52] bush. The same one that met Paul upon
[1:32:54] the road to Damascus. Oh, the same one
[1:32:56] that had his picture taken with our
[1:32:59] prophet. It was the same pillar of fire
[1:33:01] because he's the I am. And he begins to
[1:33:03] speak to Moses. Amen. But here's a
[1:33:05] beautiful thing was that the the fire
[1:33:08] didn't stay in the bush. But brother
[1:33:10] Brandham said the fire left the bush and
[1:33:12] it came upon Moses. Oh, glory to God. I
[1:33:16] love that so much. Amen. Brother
[1:33:17] Brandham would begin to say that the
[1:33:19] pillar fire that Paul met came into Paul
[1:33:22] and that's why he could write the book
[1:33:24] of Hebrews. Amen. Because the fire that
[1:33:27] was on the road came into him and that's
[1:33:29] why Moses could write the first four
[1:33:31] books of the Bible. Brother Bram said,
[1:33:32] "How would Moses know how creation
[1:33:34] began?" He wouldn't know. But I'll tell
[1:33:36] you who know, the fire knew and the fire
[1:33:39] left the bush and came into Moses and
[1:33:42] that he could write the first four books
[1:33:44] of the Bible. Oh, praise be to God.
[1:33:46] Amen. Amen. And he came into Moses in so
[1:33:50] much, Amen. that he would speak. Amen.
[1:33:53] The people, Amen, before he used to
[1:33:55] speak through the pillar of fire, but
[1:33:57] the people didn't like it. They feared
[1:33:59] it. And they said, "We don't want to see
[1:34:00] the fire no more. We don't want to hear
[1:34:03] the fire no more." And so God said, "All
[1:34:05] right, I'll raise you up a prophet, and
[1:34:08] I'll put that fire inside of him." And
[1:34:10] Moses would enter behind the veil and
[1:34:12] get the word from the Lord, and he would
[1:34:14] be the one speaking, but it wasn't his
[1:34:16] voice. He was just a mouthpiece. It was
[1:34:19] really the voice of the fire speaking.
[1:34:21] And Moses became the living word to
[1:34:24] them. Oh my. But I'm speaking of more
[1:34:27] than just Moses now because a mean look
[1:34:30] at our prophet. Amen. Brother Brandon
[1:34:32] would stand there and at the end of the
[1:34:34] service he would say how you know I'm
[1:34:36] waiting on something. He'd say he hasn't
[1:34:39] come into me yet. He's the one that does
[1:34:42] the revealing. He's the one that knows
[1:34:44] the secrets of the heart. is that if he
[1:34:46] just comes in and takes over my spirit,
[1:34:49] I mean, then he could be begin to cry
[1:34:51] out, you have arthritis and you have
[1:34:53] back trouble and you live at this
[1:34:55] address and you live at that address.
[1:34:57] Why? Amen. Because he was a prophet. God
[1:35:00] was establishing a spiritual power under
[1:35:03] a prophet and that he could come in and
[1:35:06] begin to discern the thoughts of the
[1:35:08] hearts. Oh my brother Wayne, one time he
[1:35:11] was in India and he was listening to
[1:35:13] that conference there. Moses talking to
[1:35:16] that pillar of fire and he begins to
[1:35:18] meditate on what would it be like to
[1:35:20] have that conversation? What would it be
[1:35:22] like to talk to that pillar of fire? And
[1:35:25] a voice spoke out to him and said, "You
[1:35:27] are listening to the voice of it." Amen.
[1:35:30] Do you believe that, friends? I mean,
[1:35:32] when you turn on those tapes, are you
[1:35:34] listening to the voice of William
[1:35:35] Brandom? Are you listening to the voice
[1:35:37] of the pillar of fire? Amen. It didn't
[1:35:39] just discern the hearts, but who opened
[1:35:42] those seals? Amen. Who did this? It
[1:35:44] wasn't brother Brandham. Amen. But it
[1:35:47] was the pillar of fire that come on the
[1:35:49] scene. Amen. I'll say this. I don't
[1:35:51] believe he just came here to have his
[1:35:53] picture taken. But he came here to
[1:35:55] deliver a bride. Amen. He came here,
[1:35:58] amen, to catch you up into the
[1:36:00] revelation of the word and even so much
[1:36:02] that it would so consume you till it
[1:36:04] would change your mortal body. Amen. Did
[1:36:07] not he say to Moses, Moses, I have come
[1:36:10] down to deliver them, but hold on. I'm
[1:36:13] sending you. Oh, don't get caught up in
[1:36:16] the veil. God would put himself inside
[1:36:20] of the veil. And he said, I'm sending
[1:36:22] you, Moses, but really, I am the one
[1:36:24] that has come down to deliver. And when
[1:36:27] he would write in first Thessalonians,
[1:36:29] the Lord himself shall ascend with a
[1:36:31] shout. That was a message calling a
[1:36:33] bride together. Amen. But when this
[1:36:35] picture was taken there out above the
[1:36:38] deserts, Amen. And brother Brandham
[1:36:39] could identify it and say that's our
[1:36:41] Lord up there. Amen. This is not the
[1:36:44] works of a man. This is not the works of
[1:36:47] a Kentucky hillbilly. This is the works,
[1:36:49] Amen. of God Almighty who's come down
[1:36:52] into our generation and said, "I am
[1:36:55] going to be the power to catch a bride
[1:36:58] into a rapture." Oh, fear not, Moses.
[1:37:01] Surely I will be with thee. And then
[1:37:03] you're going to come to some Red Seas.
[1:37:05] And when you come to him, if you're not
[1:37:07] careful, you're going to get a little
[1:37:09] afraid. And there, the children of
[1:37:11] Israel begin to get afraid. And they
[1:37:13] begin to worry. I mean, that we would
[1:37:15] have been better off back in Egypt. But
[1:37:17] Moses, under inspiration, spoke out and
[1:37:19] said, "Stand still and see the salvation
[1:37:22] of the Lord. Ye need not fight in this
[1:37:24] battle." And then the Lord would speak
[1:37:26] back. Moses, don't cry. Speak unto the
[1:37:29] children of Israel and go forward. Amen.
[1:37:31] Ye need not fight in this battle. Amen.
[1:37:34] But the Lord shall fight for you, just
[1:37:37] stand still. The power to deliver, Amen.
[1:37:40] is on the scene. Oh, but brother Brandon
[1:37:43] would even say, Amen, that that if it
[1:37:46] comes into me to discern, Amen. But it's
[1:37:48] got to come into you as well to believe.
[1:37:51] Amen. He say, if it comes into me, but
[1:37:53] it's got to come into you, too. And then
[1:37:56] he would go, oh, to
[1:37:59] Pentecost. How that same fire was sent
[1:38:01] down upon a church. And that same fire
[1:38:04] wouldn't just dwell in a prophet, but it
[1:38:06] would dwell in a people. And it dwells
[1:38:09] tonight in a bride. Amen. I believe in
[1:38:13] Revelations 10:7 in the days of the
[1:38:15] voice of the seventh angel. But a few
[1:38:17] verses later, he would tell John to eat
[1:38:19] the book and say, "John, thou must
[1:38:22] prophesy again." Amen. And won't this
[1:38:24] final bride? Won't this bride be the
[1:38:27] final voice to the final age under their
[1:38:30] messenger? Amen. And how are you going
[1:38:33] to do it? I mean, if it's going to speak
[1:38:35] the same thing as your messenger, are
[1:38:38] you going to have to memorize it just
[1:38:39] the way he spoke it? Or will it be the
[1:38:42] same fire that spoke it through him in a
[1:38:44] bride to speak it through you? Oh, the
[1:38:47] same fire that was in brother Brandham
[1:38:49] and his dwelling in a bride tonight. And
[1:38:53] I uh friend Moses when he stood in the
[1:38:55] presence of that pillar of fire, there
[1:38:57] was a time where he said, "Lord, who am
[1:38:58] I? I have so many insecurities. is I
[1:39:01] have so many failures. I have an
[1:39:02] impediment of speech. But there came a
[1:39:05] time where God would commission him and
[1:39:07] make him as a god onto them and as a god
[1:39:10] onto Aaron. And Aaron would be his
[1:39:12] prophet. Amen. And there's some times in
[1:39:15] your life if you're not careful, amen,
[1:39:18] that all you begin to speak is
[1:39:20] insecurities and all you begin to speak
[1:39:22] is your failures and all you begin to
[1:39:24] speak is your faults. And you say, "I'm
[1:39:26] not good enough. I'll never be good
[1:39:28] enough. I I I I'm so helpless. I'm so
[1:39:30] insufficient. And that's the truth. You
[1:39:33] are insufficient if there wasn't a
[1:39:35] higher power. Amen. But sometimes, amen,
[1:39:37] brother Dave. Amen. We got to get to the
[1:39:39] point where we stop speaking and we let
[1:39:42] the fire speak. Amen. You say, "I I I'm
[1:39:45] sick. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. I'm
[1:39:47] full of troubles." Amen. But why don't
[1:39:49] you let the fire speak for a moment? And
[1:39:52] that gene seed inside of you, that fire
[1:39:54] of God, amen, it will only speak the
[1:39:56] word. And if you let it have
[1:39:58] preeminence, amen, and you begin to
[1:40:00] confess the word, say, "No, I'm a son of
[1:40:02] God. I'm going in a rapture." Amen. I am
[1:40:06] the pure, virtuous, sinless. Amen. Bride
[1:40:09] of Jesus Christ. Oh, let the fire speak.
[1:40:14] Amen. Your voice. Amen. If you're only
[1:40:16] looking at your flesh, you're always
[1:40:18] going to come up short. Amen. But
[1:40:19] there's a life inside of you that is
[1:40:22] able to quicken this mortal body. Oh,
[1:40:25] give him the preeminence. Let him do
[1:40:27] your thinking. Amen. Cast down your
[1:40:30] thoughts. Let the fire do your thinking.
[1:40:32] Cast down your words. Let the fire do
[1:40:34] your speaking. Let the fire do your
[1:40:37] praying. Let the fire do your singing.
[1:40:39] Let the fire do the preaching. Amen.
[1:40:42] Because the voice is in the bride. Oh,
[1:40:45] speak the word says and move forward.
[1:40:48] Amen. Brother Brandham always wondered
[1:40:50] about that Mark 11. And there he is
[1:40:53] sitting under that tree that one day
[1:40:55] hunting
[1:40:56] squirrels. And the Lord begins to come
[1:40:58] and deal with him and says, "It's like
[1:41:00] all other scriptures. It's true." And
[1:41:02] brother Brandham wondered at it because
[1:41:04] he believed that every blessing must
[1:41:06] come through the atonement. And he
[1:41:08] couldn't fathom how how how somebody
[1:41:11] when the scripture said, "Ye shall say
[1:41:12] to this mountain," what if they would
[1:41:15] say the wrong thing? and and and and
[1:41:17] what if they would speak wrongly? He he
[1:41:19] had trouble understanding that. But the
[1:41:21] Lord begins to deal with them and say,
[1:41:22] "Didn't you just get through speaking
[1:41:25] about how those prophets were so
[1:41:27] anointed of God that they could speak
[1:41:29] and it wouldn't be them speaking, but it
[1:41:31] would be God speaking?" And then,
[1:41:33] Brother Brandon begin to catch it. Ah,
[1:41:35] if a believer, if Moses could do that
[1:41:38] under the blood of bulls and goats that
[1:41:40] a son or daughter of God can get so
[1:41:43] wrapped in the blood cell of God and so
[1:41:46] close in fellowship with God that it
[1:41:49] actually wouldn't be them speaking, but
[1:41:51] it would be deity speaking to the
[1:41:53] mountain be moved and cast into the sea.
[1:41:56] And if deity is speaking, Amen. then the
[1:42:00] scripture can be fulfilled. Amen.
[1:42:02] Because only deity can move a mountain.
[1:42:05] Amen. And brother Brandham said, "I see
[1:42:07] your unbelieving pastor saying it was
[1:42:09] just a mountain of sin." Amen. But he
[1:42:11] said, "No, I know." Amen. He was
[1:42:14] kneeling by Mount Ol olives. He was
[1:42:16] speaking of an actual mountain. Amen.
[1:42:19] That you could speak and mountains could
[1:42:21] be moved. That a believer under
[1:42:23] inspiration could speak and missing
[1:42:26] limbs could be restored and squirrels
[1:42:28] could come into existence. And how could
[1:42:31] it be? Because it would be deity
[1:42:34] speaking and it would be deity
[1:42:37] performing.
[1:42:38] Amen. And it might not happen in a
[1:42:40] moment. It might happen one grain at a
[1:42:42] time. But before you know it, if it was
[1:42:45] not just you speaking, but if it was
[1:42:48] deity speaking, one day that mountain
[1:42:51] shall be flat because deity will
[1:42:55] perform. As it says in Ezekiel 37, he
[1:42:58] speaks about the vision of the valley of
[1:43:00] dry bones. And at the end of it, he
[1:43:02] comes down and says, "I the Lord have
[1:43:04] spoken it. I will perform it." Amen.
[1:43:08] He's not just a speaking God. But these
[1:43:10] words that he's sent into our age,
[1:43:12] they're performing words. He said, "My
[1:43:15] word won't return void, but it will
[1:43:17] accomplish that which I sent it to do."
[1:43:20] And and we are his thoughts that have
[1:43:22] been spoken into this age. And you
[1:43:25] weren't sent here to fall short. You
[1:43:27] were sent here to accomplish
[1:43:31] what he what he spoke you to do. Amen.
[1:43:34] As the musicians
[1:43:36] come, I mean, I'm thankful that there's
[1:43:38] a power to deliver. Amen. And you know
[1:43:41] what? The one who speaks will perform.
[1:43:44] Brother Brandham comes down to the end
[1:43:46] of his rapture message notes and he
[1:43:49] says, "It has been spoken, it shall be
[1:43:52] done." Amen. Who's going to perform this
[1:43:55] rapture? Amen. Are are we going to
[1:43:58] perform it? No. The God who spoke it is
[1:44:02] the God who will perform it. Brother
[1:44:03] Brandon would stand in prayer lines and
[1:44:05] begin to deal with people and begin to
[1:44:07] exercise that Mark 11 and that if you
[1:44:10] believe and don't doubt, you can have
[1:44:12] what you asked for. And he would begin
[1:44:13] to speak to that disease and say, "Now
[1:44:15] it's been spoken. It shall be done." Oh,
[1:44:19] it's the
[1:44:20] power. and and and and before they
[1:44:23] dismiss that conference that the last
[1:44:25] verse we read and then the scripture
[1:44:27] goes on but but but he tells Moses that
[1:44:31] this will be a token onto you that when
[1:44:33] you after you have worshiped you know
[1:44:36] when you've when you've had your Exodus
[1:44:37] when you've went through the Red Sea
[1:44:39] when you went through Janice and Jras
[1:44:41] you shall serve God again upon this
[1:44:44] mountain could he he could go through
[1:44:47] the darkest trials you know he had some
[1:44:49] hard days But you know, he could lay in
[1:44:52] his bed after those hardest days and
[1:44:54] just begin to think, Lord, what will it
[1:44:56] be one of these days? I'm going to reach
[1:44:59] that mountain again. And I'll worship
[1:45:01] you on that mountain, Lord.
[1:45:04] Amen. What you know what it was like?
[1:45:06] what what it must have meant to Paul
[1:45:09] when he was on that ship and it was
[1:45:11] tossing with every wave and the angel
[1:45:15] come in the ship and said Paul be of
[1:45:17] good cheer for thou must be brought
[1:45:20] before Caesar and there won't be the
[1:45:22] loss of any man or of the ship and when
[1:45:25] Paul didn't know what was going to stand
[1:45:26] between him and Caesar but he had the
[1:45:29] promise from an angel I'm going to be
[1:45:32] brought before Caesar Moses had a
[1:45:34] promise I'm going to be brought back to
[1:45:36] this mountain. And and we have a promise
[1:45:39] that one of these days that that land
[1:45:42] which we came from, that back part of
[1:45:45] the mind of God, that fellowship that we
[1:45:47] had where we shouted like Job before the
[1:45:50] foundation of the world and when we are
[1:45:52] going to go back, amen, to where we came
[1:45:56] from. Amen. We're only here in an
[1:45:58] Exodus. We're only here for a season.
[1:46:01] Amen. But the power is saying, don't
[1:46:04] fear. be of good cheer. And when you
[1:46:07] came from me, you're going to return to
[1:46:09] me. I'll be with you. I'll never leave
[1:46:12] you nor forsake you. And if you ever
[1:46:15] come to a mountain in your way, and it's
[1:46:19] in the path of duty, just wait on
[1:46:22] me. Hold on. Stand
[1:46:26] still. See the salvation of the Lord.
[1:46:28] I'll make a way where there is no way.
[1:46:31] And it won't be by might. It won't be by
[1:46:34] power, but as it said in Ze, I believe
[1:46:36] it's Zephaniah 4 or Zechariah 4, but
[1:46:39] it'll be by my spirit, sayaeth the Lord.
[1:46:42] Oh, brother Brandon would
[1:46:44] say, and not by might, not by power.
[1:46:48] This message didn't come by might or
[1:46:49] power, but it come by the spirit of the
[1:46:51] Lord with shoutings, crying, grace,
[1:46:55] grace onto it. It would be a message of
[1:46:58] grace. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Not by
[1:47:01] might, not by power, but it came to turn
[1:47:04] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:47:08] fathers, or to, in other words, I mean,
[1:47:11] the quotes there, I'm just paraphrasing
[1:47:13] it, but in other words, to build up a
[1:47:16] church in the power of God built upon
[1:47:20] the right foundation.
[1:47:22] All the
[1:47:23] denominations didn't have the power,
[1:47:26] amen, for this exodus. But God said, "I
[1:47:29] will build a spiritual system under a
[1:47:31] prophet that will rebuild a people in
[1:47:34] the power of God." Amen. That she'll be
[1:47:37] able to stand against every battle,
[1:47:39] every w of the devil. Amen. Are you
[1:47:42] thankful for it tonight?
[1:47:44] Amen. He's our exodus. Amen. Our Exodus
[1:47:48] is more than a book tonight. Our exodus
[1:47:51] is a person. He's your exodus from
[1:47:55] sickness to health. He is your exodus
[1:47:58] from the wheelchair to walking. And
[1:48:00] brother Brandham said, "The angel of the
[1:48:01] Lord accompanies this message always."
[1:48:04] So I believe I can say by the authority
[1:48:06] of the word, "Your Exodus is in the
[1:48:08] building tonight."
[1:48:10] Amen. If you have a need, your exodus is
[1:48:12] in the building tonight. You don't have
[1:48:15] to step
[1:48:17] amen into a counseling session with a a
[1:48:21] a hundstep program. I I I'm not speaking
[1:48:23] against, you know, if you counsel with
[1:48:25] your pastor and those things. I, you
[1:48:27] know, I believe those things have their
[1:48:28] place. But I believe there's a light
[1:48:32] that you can step into that's in the
[1:48:34] building
[1:48:35] tonight. Oh, that just a moment in that
[1:48:38] light of
[1:48:40] deliverance. And it'll open doors like
[1:48:42] it opened them for Peter in the prison.
[1:48:45] It looked like he was stuck in that
[1:48:46] prison, but a light come into that
[1:48:48] prison and begin to open doors. Oh, and
[1:48:51] I believe that light can still open
[1:48:52] doors tonight. I believe that light can
[1:48:55] close doors where you're not meant to
[1:48:57] walk. It can open them where you're
[1:48:59] meant to walk. It can stop the mouths of
[1:49:02] lions. Amen. You can change your path.
[1:49:06] Like brother Bham said, there they were
[1:49:09] walking in the hot sun of the task
[1:49:11] masters, but they changed from walking
[1:49:14] under that light to walking in the light
[1:49:17] of the pillar of fire. You can change
[1:49:20] courses from walking under the cruel sun
[1:49:23] of this dark evil age and you can turn
[1:49:27] aside and begin to walk in the light of
[1:49:31] the pillar of fire. Maybe we'll just bow
[1:49:34] our heads
[1:49:36] tonight. Amen. If you have a need in
[1:49:39] your heart, I believe the power to
[1:49:40] deliver is
[1:49:42] here. Amen. Maybe it's already delivered
[1:49:44] you, dear. Steering the preaching of the
[1:49:47] word, not because of any words of Isaac
[1:49:50] Hatfield, but Amen. Like Peter could
[1:49:54] speak these words and they could receive
[1:49:56] the Holy Ghost. These words still have
[1:49:59] power for they're not the words of man.
[1:50:02] Heavenly Father, I pray Lord that you
[1:50:05] just Lord bless each one tonight.
[1:50:07] Father, as we feel your presence in the
[1:50:10] building, Father, I believe though I
[1:50:12] can't see it with my natural eyes, I
[1:50:15] believe that pillar of fire is here
[1:50:16] tonight.
[1:50:17] Lord, you said that angel would
[1:50:20] accompany this message. You said it
[1:50:23] would be here, Father. It didn't leave
[1:50:25] with Brother Brandham. As brother Wayne
[1:50:28] said, one of those in that picture is
[1:50:30] still here. It's not brother Brandon,
[1:50:32] but Lord, it's that pillar of fire. It's
[1:50:35] still here. It's still here to deliver
[1:50:38] the drunkard from its alcohol. It's
[1:50:41] still here to deliver from pornography.
[1:50:43] It's still here to deliver from a
[1:50:45] lukewarm spirit. It's still here to
[1:50:47] deliver, amen, from sin and sickness.
[1:50:50] It's still here to deliver from cancer.
[1:50:53] It's still here to deliver from eczema.
[1:50:55] It's still here to deliver from
[1:50:58] arthritis.
[1:50:59] Lord, that light that stood by the
[1:51:02] prophet, Lord, stood there on the his
[1:51:04] right side, but sometimes it would leave
[1:51:07] his right side and come into him and
[1:51:10] begin to
[1:51:11] speak. Father, I believe your light is
[1:51:14] here tonight, Lord. And I don't believe
[1:51:16] there's anything too hard for you.
[1:51:20] May we just stand still in your
[1:51:22] presence,
[1:51:23] Lord. And as your prophet began to
[1:51:26] speak, the children of Israel stood
[1:51:28] still and
[1:51:30] watched. But then their enemy had to
[1:51:33] stand still. Because they stood still
[1:51:35] and waited on you, their enemy had to
[1:51:38] stand
[1:51:40] still. And father, I believe, Lord, the
[1:51:42] prophet began to
[1:51:44] say, Lord, that we ought to follow
[1:51:47] instruction and not emotion. And he said
[1:51:50] they would have just followed a motion.
[1:51:51] They would have been running around
[1:51:53] those sea banks and the Pharaoh's army
[1:51:55] would have caught him. But because they
[1:51:57] followed the instructions, stand still
[1:51:59] and see the salvation of the Lord, they
[1:52:01] were led through a Red Sea and their
[1:52:04] enemy was drowned. And Father, if we
[1:52:06] stand still and follow the instructions
[1:52:09] of your word, Lord, if there's one here
[1:52:11] desiring the Holy Ghost, the instruction
[1:52:13] is to repent and be baptized and you
[1:52:14] shall receive the Holy Ghost. And if
[1:52:17] they just do that, their enemy will have
[1:52:19] to stand still and watch as those chains
[1:52:22] of sin fall from their lives and they're
[1:52:24] born again in the power of God. Lord,
[1:52:27] one of these days, our enemy will have
[1:52:29] to stand still and watch as these old
[1:52:31] wrinkled bodies are made young. Lord, as
[1:52:35] our loved ones, as our prodigals come
[1:52:37] home, Lord, as our bodies are changed,
[1:52:40] as this exodus
[1:52:42] fulfilled, our enemy will have to stand
[1:52:44] still and just watch for his power is no
[1:52:49] match for yours. Lord,
[1:52:52] I pray you bless your children tonight.
[1:52:54] We give you glory in Jesus
[1:52:56] name. Amen and amen. God bless you.
[1:53:00] Amen. If you have a son,
[1:53:03] mountain.
[1:53:07] Hallelujah.
[1:53:10] They say these chains will never break.
[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:21] Let's just stand and worship the Lord
[1:53:23] for a moment. I know we've held you
[1:53:26] long, but I believe he's worthy of just
[1:53:29] a few moments of our time.
[1:53:34] We've heard that there is no way
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:42] through. We've heard the tide will
[1:53:46] never
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:50] change. But they haven't seen what you
[1:53:54] can do.
[1:53:58] There is
[1:54:00] power in your name.
[1:54:05] Oh, there's so much
[1:54:08] power in your
[1:54:15] name. Move the
[1:54:19] unbelable. Break the unbreakable.
[1:54:24] God we
[1:54:28] believe. God we believe for it. From the
[1:54:36] impossible will see a
[1:54:40] miracle. God we believe. Yes Lord.
[1:54:45] God we believe for him.
[1:54:52] Oh
[1:54:53] hallelujah. We know that hope is never
[1:55:01] lost. For there is still an empty
[1:55:07] grave. God we believe. God we believe.
[1:55:12] No
[1:55:13] matter
[1:55:16] what there is
[1:55:19] power in your
[1:55:22] name. There's so much power, so much
[1:55:27] power in your
[1:55:33] name. Oh, move the
[1:55:38] unbroable. Break the
[1:55:42] unbreakable. God, we believe. God, I
[1:55:46] believe. God
[1:55:49] rebel for it. From the
[1:55:55] impossible, I will see a
[1:55:59] miracle. God, we
[1:56:02] believe. Yes, Lord. God, we believe for
[1:56:09] you. We know. Oh, we know that hope is
[1:56:16] never
[1:56:20] lost. For there is still an empty
[1:56:26] grave. God we
[1:56:29] believe God we believe. No matter
[1:56:35] what, there is
[1:56:38] power in your name. Want to believe it
[1:56:44] tonight? There is
[1:56:47] power in your name.
[1:56:54] Oh
[1:56:58] me break
[1:57:02] me
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:08] God the
[1:57:11] [Music]
[1:57:14] impossible I will
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:28] God
[1:57:30] you bring
[1:57:34] me God.
[1:57:39] Oh God, I
[1:57:41] believe it will be
[1:57:45] impossible. I will
[1:57:49] say God I
[1:57:51] [Music]
[1:57:52] believe. Oh yes, Lord God
[1:57:57] [Music]
[1:58:01] I when there seems to be no way. Yes,
[1:58:06] Lord. Lord, I trust in you, God. You
[1:58:11] have the foundation. You are the way.
[1:58:15] You are the way. When there seems to be
[1:58:20] no way, oh God, I'll trust in you. Is
[1:58:26] God
[1:58:27] together. For you are the way. You are
[1:58:32] the way. And there seems to be no way.
[1:58:37] Hallelujah. Oh, I trust in you, God. You
[1:58:42] have the You are the way to get on the
[1:58:46] way. You are my way. When there seems to
[1:58:51] be no way. Oh, we trust in you, Lord. We
[1:58:55] trust in you, God. Have a father
