[38:10] amen it's more
[38:12] it's more precious to us today
[38:14] than it was before
[38:16] because we see the the effect the
[38:18] reality
[38:19] of the anchor of that life
[38:22] you know
[38:23] theology can never bring that
[38:26] but it's only his life
[38:29] his life will anchor us in the word to
[38:31] where that
[38:33] when we don't know what's going on or

[38:51] in
[38:52] swinging the
[38:54] the slingshot he was he was an expert at
[38:56] that he was very good at it
[38:59] but it wasn't it wasn't
[39:01] david
[39:02] that slew goliath
[39:05] it was a supernatural anointing
[39:08] that was upon david
[39:10] that was able to direct that stone to
[39:14] the forehead of the giant
[39:16] it looked like a flesh and blood affair
[39:18] but it wasn't
[39:19] it was spiritual
[39:21] a lot of things we look at sometimes
[39:23] seem like flesh and blood affair but
[39:24] it's not
[39:25] it's
[39:26] spiritual it's spiritual
[39:29] amen we i heard there are different
[39:31] requests

[39:45] many
[39:47] many great victories along the way
[39:50] and
[39:51] where he is
[39:53] so we just want to continue to keep him
[39:55] in prayer that god will just continue to
[39:57] strengthen him
[39:59] and
[40:01] there also if you would like to give
[40:03] towards this
[40:05] they've they've incurred
[40:07] there's
[40:08] quite a bit of medical expenses that's
[40:10] just been incurred and
[40:12] there's some things we've just already
[40:14] sent
[40:15] over there
[40:16] just for the the week that he's been in
[40:18] there
[40:19] and
[40:20] actually a few weeks
[40:22] and so just if you'd like to contribute
[40:25] to that just put that in the missions
[40:27] box and we'll see that gets directly
[40:30] over there
[40:31] for them
[40:32] um
[40:34] so we just want to continue to remember
[40:35] them in prayer
[40:36] [Music]
[40:38] also remember i know the
[40:41] request that was
[40:43] made known here regarding the the
[40:45] hurricane many of you have known about
[40:47] that that's coming in
[40:49] and
[40:50] there in louisiana and i just just had
[40:52] received a
[40:54] text from brother tim pruitt and them
[40:55] they're not
[40:56] they're not going to be lord willing
[40:58] won't be affected by it but you know
[40:59] there's other there's other places that
[41:02] are that are the southernmost part and
[41:05] so there has been some things that
[41:06] brother tim was talking about they were
[41:07] kind of dealing with some of the covet
[41:09] and things like that so we just want to
[41:12] just remember them in prayer
[41:15] just remember also that that that
[41:17] particular place as we just look to the
[41:19] lord
[41:20] knowing that that that hurricane and
[41:22] that's coming in and we just want to ask
[41:24] for the mercy of god
[41:25] i think many of you probably
[41:29] heard seen clips or whatever more and
[41:31] you just see just the
[41:33] just the mess catastrophe over there in
[41:36] afghanistan i tell you what a shame
[41:39] i don't know how to say what a shame
[41:41] and
[41:42] i just my heart is just
[41:45] my heart's been so heavy
[41:47] because
[41:48] you know just to see you know in the
[41:51] case that where you have lives that are
[41:52] just left
[41:54] and
[41:55] you know there's many that are standing
[41:57] there i don't know any message believers
[42:00] there's a lot of things that some as far
[42:02] as with brothers we're just kind of
[42:04] just contacting around in that
[42:08] but there's there's others who are
[42:09] walking in what light that they do have
[42:12] there's some that are leaving
[42:14] and there's others that are they're
[42:16] going to stay
[42:17] because they've made a declaration i
[42:19] want you to think of this
[42:21] they made a declaration to stay
[42:23] many of them because they said how else
[42:26] can the light be spread
[42:29] i'll tell you friends
[42:30] you have
[42:31] these are examples and situations of
[42:34] individuals
[42:35] that it's deadly for them to come out of
[42:37] their homes
[42:40] but they've come into contact with the
[42:42] measure of light that they have
[42:44] to be able to stand
[42:46] and be a witness
[42:49] say may god help us
[42:51] because right here
[42:52] we've got it easy
[42:55] we have got it easy
[42:57] sure we've got battles we've got
[42:59] temptations we've got things all around
[43:01] but
[43:02] there's not one of us that had to go
[43:03] outside of our house today and worry is
[43:05] there somebody watching us or do they
[43:07] have us on a are we on the you know
[43:09] notorious hit list or no we're not on
[43:12] that
[43:13] but what grace has given to i believe i
[43:15] believe there's such an accountability
[43:17] to us may we just put everything we have
[43:19] into it amen for the opportunity god's
[43:22] given us in this hour and i would just
[43:24] ask you just to keep continue to keep
[43:26] just even that that situation in prayer
[43:29] as well god just be merciful uh
[43:32] i just i think it's just been a lot on
[43:34] my heart and i've thought about that
[43:36] i've talked about it with our family
[43:38] just even devotion i said i just it's
[43:40] just very heavy to me
[43:42] it's very very heavy when i see that and
[43:44] so
[43:45] but we know we do know this reality
[43:48] this world
[43:50] is not our home
[43:53] and we know that soon and very soon
[43:56] amen
[43:57] the kingdoms of this world will become
[44:00] the kingdoms
[44:01] amen
[44:03] of the lord and his christ
[44:05] amen that we we shall rule and reign
[44:08] here a thousand years in the preparation
[44:11] then for the future home so we we have
[44:14] everything in the world
[44:15] to look forward to
[44:17] amen so
[44:19] may we
[44:21] you know
[44:22] take the true example
[44:24] and like moses and them stood there when
[44:27] they offered moses and them and said you
[44:29] can go ahead and go moses stood there
[44:31] and said will not leave one
[44:34] behind
[44:36] not one
[44:38] may that be the very
[44:40] issue from our hearts not one behind
[44:43] lord
[44:44] not one behind
[44:46] amen
[44:48] amen you love the lord this morning
[44:51] amen we're just living and really
[44:54] for the world it's very
[44:56] it's a very dark time but this is an
[44:58] awesome time to be serving god
[45:01] it's an awesome time to be serving god
[45:04] amen
[45:07] let's just let's just turn our hearts to
[45:09] the lord if you'd like to stand with me
[45:12] as we go to isaiah 53
[45:17] and uh i'm just gonna read just a verse
[45:20] of scripture from here
[45:23] and uh
[45:26] i know that this chapter is a very
[45:28] familiar chapter to you
[45:30] and that's it's not
[45:33] i'd love to read the whole chapter i
[45:36] just would ask that you
[45:37] do that maybe sometime in this week
[45:40] but just to draw from this here
[45:43] and this portion and i'm just going to
[45:45] read the first verse
[45:47] and draw from here for a text
[45:50] and to recognize this was a prophecy
[45:53] hundreds of years
[45:55] before
[45:57] where isaiah himself
[46:00] what he would utter
[46:01] would be against his own human senses
[46:07] are you catching me
[46:09] it was against his own human senses
[46:13] this is why
[46:15] he was caught up
[46:17] above his human senses
[46:19] because no human sense reasoning
[46:22] all of those spiritual gates none of
[46:25] them could have ever expressed behold a
[46:28] virgin shall conceive
[46:32] none of them could have expressed what
[46:33] was seen here it had to be the
[46:36] supernatural
[46:37] god
[46:39] that would catch isaiah up isaiah was
[46:42] gifted to be caught up to see this and
[46:45] you know as you read it here in the
[46:47] scripture
[46:48] this is not read
[46:49] in a manner of will be shall be
[46:53] is to come this
[46:55] is mentioned in he was
[46:59] wounded
[47:00] past tense
[47:02] by his stripes we
[47:05] were healed
[47:07] because in the mind of god the lamb was
[47:10] already slain
[47:12] from the foundation of the world this is
[47:14] only the outworking of the word even as
[47:16] it's taking place even right now
[47:19] so verse one let's read let's read this
[47:21] if we could
[47:23] in isaiah 53 verse 1
[47:26] who
[47:27] hath
[47:28] believed
[47:29] our report
[47:31] and to whom
[47:33] is the arm
[47:35] of the lord
[47:36] revealed read that again who hath
[47:40] believed our
[47:42] report
[47:44] i'd like to say this to you
[47:46] that
[47:47] when we have believed the report of the
[47:50] lord it shows itself
[47:54] in the strength in our lives
[47:57] then it's no longer we're not reading
[47:59] this as a letter well isaiah wrote this
[48:01] under the spirit of god but now we say
[48:04] who hath believed our
[48:06] report
[48:07] because the same spirit that moved upon
[48:10] the prophets that caught isaiah up to
[48:13] speak this the same spirit of god that
[48:15] moved and created that that body to come
[48:19] and to dwell in that his own life
[48:21] and then to offer that up for us now
[48:23] that life come back into us then we are
[48:26] identified within this scripture who
[48:29] hath believed our report
[48:33] we don't have a different report
[48:36] is that right paul warned he says you
[48:38] better not have a different gospel
[48:40] it better be the same gospel
[48:43] the same report the same original report
[48:47] amen
[48:48] i'd like to speak to you this morning if
[48:50] the lord would help we're looking at
[48:51] that thought on you have a voice but i
[48:53] want to really narrow it in on and just
[48:55] speak on the continuation
[48:58] the continuation
[49:00] let's bow our heads our word of prayer
[49:02] heavenly father
[49:04] lord we thank you so much for your mercy
[49:08] thank you lord for this this
[49:10] lord
[49:11] awesome moment lord that we
[49:14] are living in in this time
[49:17] lord when we look and we see you dear
[49:21] god just see
[49:22] the very richness of your presence lord
[49:26] just dwelling right among us lord
[49:29] and moving and vindicating yourself to
[49:32] be the same
[49:34] what a peace and what a joy lord your
[49:37] presence oh god in our lives it brings
[49:40] to us oh god
[49:42] lord we thank you father that while
[49:44] there is
[49:45] darkness all around us a darkness as the
[49:48] bible said that can be felt but we're
[49:51] grateful that there's light
[49:53] in our dwellings lord
[49:56] father
[49:57] that's a work of your grace lord
[50:00] that's not anything that we had anything
[50:02] to do with that's just the unmerited
[50:05] grace of god
[50:06] and lord we just pray this morning that
[50:09] you would come lord for each one of
[50:11] these needs lord even many needs that
[50:13] we've mentioned lord
[50:15] lord needs and things that's just so
[50:17] lord heavy on our heart lord we pray
[50:20] that god that you'll just lord move in a
[50:22] very special way o god
[50:25] and father just minister to each of
[50:27] those needs each of those lives lord
[50:30] i pray that god that you'll just now
[50:33] come through your word and just speak to
[50:35] our hearts in a very personal way this
[50:37] morning we need to hear from you lord i
[50:40] pray that god it will not be the voice
[50:43] of a man that we would hear because that
[50:45] could help no one but may it be your
[50:48] voice lord jesus that god will just come
[50:51] and speak to our hearts we pray we love
[50:54] you and thank you now lord in the name
[50:56] of jesus christ amen
[50:59] and god bless you as you're being seated
[51:03] this this very
[51:06] this very word and very
[51:09] term who hath believed our report
[51:12] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[51:14] revealed
[51:16] brother brown would just say it just as
[51:18] simple as this in god hiding and
[51:21] revealing in simplicity and he would
[51:22] just say it
[51:24] to believe the report
[51:26] is the evidence that the arm of the lord
[51:28] has been revealed
[51:30] because the arm of the lord
[51:33] is the very strength and the might of
[51:36] almighty god
[51:38] and so we realize that and you you think
[51:41] many times there is
[51:43] a personifying in the scriptures it will
[51:45] say the hand of the lord the arm of the
[51:47] lord and on and on it speaks of god's
[51:50] dealing with man and god becoming
[51:53] present god condescending god coming
[51:56] down
[51:57] and we know that it was necessary
[52:00] that god himself would come in such a
[52:03] manner in order to impart his strength
[52:06] and his life into you and i
[52:09] and so when we we look at this i want to
[52:12] bring
[52:13] into the scripture that we're familiar
[52:15] with in hebrews 13 8
[52:18] where the scripture says jesus christ is
[52:21] the same yesterday
[52:23] and today
[52:25] and forever
[52:27] that that scripture is not just
[52:30] something that we see on a tape case
[52:32] it's not just to be a scripture that we
[52:35] know and can recite and finish the rest
[52:38] of it but it's to be a living expression
[52:43] it's it's to be a living reality in and
[52:46] through our lives he's the same in
[52:48] principle
[52:49] in strength in everything
[52:52] because he's god and he changes not
[52:56] whatever he did
[52:57] he still does today and whatever he's
[53:00] doing today if there's a tomorrow he's
[53:03] going to continue what he's always done
[53:06] when the same conditions are met
[53:09] he's the word and he cannot fail
[53:13] and god hiding in some publicity brother
[53:15] branham says do you know the early
[53:16] christians according to the ancient
[53:18] history of the early church they carried
[53:21] crosses on their backs
[53:23] wherever they went to signify and
[53:25] identify themselves as christians
[53:28] now the catholics claimed that that was
[53:30] them
[53:31] of course they claimed they was the
[53:33] first ones but the catholic church
[53:35] wasn't even organized then but
[53:37] christians packed the cross
[53:39] he said you've heard people say cross
[53:42] back you refer that to catholic
[53:45] it is the real catholic the universal
[53:48] holy ghost church of the world correct
[53:52] we are catholic we are the original
[53:55] catholic the bible believing catholic
[54:00] they are the church catholic the
[54:01] organization
[54:03] we are free from that
[54:06] we are the continuation of the doctrine
[54:10] of the apostles
[54:12] we are the continuation of the baptism
[54:15] of the holy ghost and all the things
[54:17] that the early church stood for
[54:20] and the catholic church has none of them
[54:24] so to see that within it the
[54:26] continuation
[54:28] that we recognize that it's satan's
[54:31] desire was to always to come and to try
[54:34] to break a continuity
[54:36] but god has made a promise in his word
[54:40] then i will restore saith the lord
[54:44] and to recognize that in in this in the
[54:47] time and the hour that we're living in a
[54:50] continuation of something
[54:53] is is the re is when we look at this in
[54:55] the term of the gospel and of the word
[54:58] it is an action or a carrying on this is
[55:01] what continuation it means it's a
[55:03] process of things being content
[55:06] continued on let me just say it like
[55:08] this there are some things that we can
[55:10] look at in our lives that need to be
[55:12] continued and then there's other things
[55:15] that need to be discontinued
[55:18] is that right
[55:19] the spirit of god comes in such a way to
[55:22] deal with our lives in such a manner to
[55:24] not only bring conviction into our lives
[55:28] of things that are not approving of the
[55:31] spirit of god but he also comes to bring
[55:35] strength and deliverance that we might
[55:37] live above that so that it's not us
[55:41] actually overcoming but it now is the
[55:44] spirit of god in us that's already
[55:47] overcome the world that's overcoming the
[55:50] world whatever he's dealing with in our
[55:53] life
[55:54] and so there is the con the continuation
[55:58] and notice how that that here luke when
[56:01] he would write in acts chapter 1. in
[56:03] acts chapter 1 verse 1 the bible says
[56:06] the former treaties have i have i made o
[56:09] falafelus of all that jesus began both
[56:13] to do
[56:14] and teach until the day in which he was
[56:17] taken up after that he through the holy
[56:20] ghost had given commandments unto the
[56:23] apostles whom he had chosen to whom also
[56:27] he showed himself alive after his
[56:29] passion by many infallible proofs being
[56:32] seen of them 40 days and speaking of the
[56:36] things pertaining to the kingdom of god
[56:39] and being assembled together with them
[56:41] commanded them that they should not
[56:44] depart from jerusalem but wait for the
[56:47] promise of the father which saith he ye
[56:50] have heard of me
[56:52] for john truly baptized with water but
[56:55] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[56:58] not many days hence when they were
[57:00] therefore come together they asked of
[57:02] him lord wilt thou at this time restore
[57:05] again the kingdom to israel and he said
[57:08] unto them it's not for you to know the
[57:10] times or the seasons which the father
[57:13] hath put in his own power but you shall
[57:16] receive power after that the holy ghost
[57:20] is come upon you and you shall be
[57:22] witnesses unto me i really want to draw
[57:26] upon that you shall be witnesses unto me
[57:31] he is letting it be known that your life
[57:34] will become a reflection and that which
[57:39] will also be uh the carrying of the true
[57:42] report that when others
[57:45] that are in bondage and others that are
[57:48] enslaved there's gonna be a liberty a
[57:51] power that sounds through your life and
[57:54] it'll be that power sounding in your
[57:56] life that'll make known to the people
[57:59] that liberty has truly come and they
[58:02] themselves can be a partaker of it
[58:06] so we recognize that within this that
[58:09] even as we see this you shall be
[58:11] witnesses unto me not drawing somebody
[58:14] to a church
[58:16] not drawing them to a creed
[58:18] but get them to him
[58:20] you see that's what a real real witness
[58:22] is a real witness is one that desires to
[58:26] bring one into the presence of the lord
[58:29] jesus christ
[58:30] because he's the only one that can
[58:32] change a life
[58:34] there's a lot of things that we could
[58:36] share and give and you know don't do
[58:38] this and don't do that and and the
[58:40] reality of it is is that it has to come
[58:43] about where there comes a change in the
[58:45] nature on the inside to where god moves
[58:49] down to take the want to and the desire
[58:52] of the world that then he moves on the
[58:55] inside and you become united with him in
[59:00] a union
[59:01] amen is that all right
[59:03] not just a good moral person we believe
[59:06] in that i hope you understand what i'm
[59:08] saying
[59:09] it sanctifies our life but the evidence
[59:13] of the holy spirit is you're in the word
[59:17] it's where you're united with the word
[59:20] he's your everything where he is you are
[59:27] ye shall be witness unto me now notice
[59:30] both in jerusalem
[59:33] in judea in samaria you can put your
[59:36] home in there
[59:37] your workplace in there your community
[59:40] in there your street in there and unto
[59:42] the outermost part of the earth
[59:46] you see
[59:47] he's done what he needed to do the lord
[59:51] jesus has done what he needed to do
[59:54] now he's announcing to them that through
[59:57] the power of the holy ghost
[59:59] operating through sons and daughters of
[1:00:02] god it will bear witness of me in all of
[1:00:07] the places that i will send you it's
[1:00:11] with the purpose of drawing lives to
[1:00:14] himself
[1:00:16] and the bible said when he had spoken
[1:00:18] these things while they beheld he was
[1:00:20] taken up in a cloud received him out of
[1:00:23] their sight
[1:00:24] and you see even when you look at that
[1:00:26] in verse nine if i could just make a few
[1:00:28] comments just as it comes to me you
[1:00:30] remember the bible here they were they
[1:00:32] were standing and they were watching
[1:00:35] this i mean they've seen a lot of
[1:00:36] supernatural events their life has been
[1:00:39] had they have witnessed supernatural
[1:00:42] after supernatural after supernatural
[1:00:44] not just not just before the crucifixion
[1:00:47] but after the crucifixion here they are
[1:00:50] getting ready to go fishing and he is
[1:00:52] there on the shore bidding them to come
[1:00:54] brother braham says every turn of the
[1:00:56] way here it was there he was it was the
[1:00:59] supernatural he was showing himself
[1:01:02] alive
[1:01:04] and then here as he ascends up there uh
[1:01:08] as they are gathered there together and
[1:01:10] notice that when the bible says here
[1:01:12] they were they were beholding this and
[1:01:14] they were looking and and they were no
[1:01:16] longer fearful they were filled with joy
[1:01:19] but the angels had a message for them
[1:01:22] the angels let him know
[1:01:24] that you need to get to jerusalem
[1:01:27] and you need to receive the promise that
[1:01:30] he has brought to you
[1:01:34] the message is great but the message is
[1:01:36] here for a purpose that we might be
[1:01:40] filled with the holy spirit
[1:01:43] are you with me not just to look up on
[1:01:46] something and say wow
[1:01:48] my what no it's to get into the place
[1:01:53] because the message is the call to get
[1:01:56] under the blood
[1:01:59] the lord jesus had roles and he had
[1:02:02] gathered them to the promise they had a
[1:02:05] sure expectation when they came back to
[1:02:08] jerusalem it was not a maybe so it was
[1:02:10] not a hope so they went there with joy
[1:02:13] the bible says because they knew that
[1:02:16] the promise that was made that god
[1:02:19] himself has come to vindicate it and
[1:02:22] make it real to their hearts that this
[1:02:25] is for you
[1:02:28] they went there with joy because they
[1:02:30] know it's certain let me just say this
[1:02:32] with every promise of god when it comes
[1:02:34] to the holy ghost when it comes to
[1:02:36] healing when it comes to it's a certain
[1:02:39] promise if you can believe
[1:02:44] it's certain it's a certain promise
[1:02:46] there was a call that they must get
[1:02:48] beneath the blood they had to enter into
[1:02:51] the life of the holy ghost it was not
[1:02:54] going to be enough for them just to
[1:02:56] simply talk about it
[1:02:58] there would not be enough that they
[1:02:59] would be able to talk about the lord
[1:03:01] jesus and you know be able to well we
[1:03:04] can rehearse when he did this or we did
[1:03:06] that it was not enough there was no
[1:03:08] longer it was not enough to talk about
[1:03:11] the message they had to get beneath it
[1:03:16] all of those things were a sign
[1:03:18] to them
[1:03:20] that your day of freedom is here
[1:03:26] all of that was a sign your day of
[1:03:29] liberty is here this is why brother
[1:03:31] branham could say in the message token
[1:03:33] and when he preaches the message
[1:03:34] desperation and he points and he brings
[1:03:37] the people to a place he said now look
[1:03:39] the token has been here all along he's
[1:03:42] the one who's been working all the
[1:03:44] miracles all the signs everything that
[1:03:47] you've seen done we've seen it right
[1:03:49] here before us but now is the time to
[1:03:51] come under that token that life
[1:03:56] see it's the call and assembly we've
[1:03:58] been brought together been drawn to that
[1:04:01] of the lord jesus christ now to think of
[1:04:03] this here this this sounding of the
[1:04:06] acceptable year
[1:04:07] in the very life as we've looked at this
[1:04:09] over a number of services where the lord
[1:04:12] jesus was walking here upon this earth
[1:04:14] he manifested that this indeed is the
[1:04:18] acceptable year the spirit of the lord
[1:04:21] is upon me we've went through that in
[1:04:23] the scripture he went and they were the
[1:04:25] sick were healed those were demon
[1:04:27] possessed they were devils were cast out
[1:04:30] lives were changed that that their life
[1:04:33] had had such a bad reputation of like
[1:04:36] the woman at the well and you know
[1:04:38] legion he could never get free on and on
[1:04:40] we could go those who didn't even have
[1:04:42] eyes eyes were created those who had
[1:04:45] infirmity in their life here they are
[1:04:47] they receive strength and woman who has
[1:04:50] stooped over and doubts she can stand up
[1:04:51] straight who was that that was doing
[1:04:54] that that was almighty god in the
[1:04:56] fulfillment of his word and that word
[1:04:59] was sounding out in that hour and it was
[1:05:02] founding a liberty to the hearts and
[1:05:04] lives of the people according to the
[1:05:07] word for the scripture said he bore our
[1:05:10] sicknesses he bore our infirmity here he
[1:05:14] was standing as the lamb of god that was
[1:05:17] declared by revelation to take away the
[1:05:20] sin of the world it was announced that
[1:05:23] this is the one this is the messiah and
[1:05:26] here is he standing here within that
[1:05:28] time he also could announce to the
[1:05:31] believers in that hour in john 14 12
[1:05:35] verily verily i say unto you he that
[1:05:38] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:05:41] shall he do also
[1:05:43] he wasn't talking about meat baskets
[1:05:45] fruit baskets cheese and cracker
[1:05:46] platters he wasn't talking about working
[1:05:48] down at the local homeless shelter come
[1:05:51] on now he wasn't talking about all those
[1:05:53] things those are works of the flesh
[1:05:57] you can't work your way into the kingdom
[1:05:59] of god
[1:06:02] the bible says that we would labor to
[1:06:04] enter into his rest but it's not our
[1:06:06] works the labor is us dying to ourselves
[1:06:10] that's the real labor right there is us
[1:06:13] coming to a place to no longer
[1:06:15] love this life above the life that's
[1:06:18] presented to us
[1:06:20] that's the real labor that's the victory
[1:06:22] right there and he made a way that we
[1:06:24] can come in to that victory and live by
[1:06:27] that victory as he said he that
[1:06:29] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:06:32] shall he do also
[1:06:34] and greater works than thee shall he do
[1:06:37] because i go unto my father and
[1:06:39] whatsoever you ask in my name that will
[1:06:42] i do that the father may be glorified in
[1:06:45] the sun notice that the father may be
[1:06:48] glorified in the son if you shall ask
[1:06:50] anything in my name i will do it
[1:06:54] now brother branham brings it like this
[1:06:57] in the resurrection of jesus in 1956 he
[1:07:00] said now remember his corporal body is
[1:07:03] the high priest that's sitting before
[1:07:05] the throne of god with the blood making
[1:07:08] intercession his spirit called the holy
[1:07:11] spirit is here living with us in our
[1:07:14] spirit doing the same things carrying on
[1:07:18] the ministry that he started my my mind
[1:07:22] you see he started this ministry in his
[1:07:27] own earthly body
[1:07:30] and he finishes this ministry in the
[1:07:33] body of believers the bride of jesus
[1:07:37] christ
[1:07:38] redemption was started we're reading
[1:07:40] isaiah 53 but remember there has to be a
[1:07:44] finishing up of redemption when the last
[1:07:48] name is called is that right there's
[1:07:51] only so many names on the lamb's book of
[1:07:53] life there's no there's no no record in
[1:07:55] the scripture that names are being
[1:07:58] compiled right now but what it is is the
[1:08:01] lamb's book of life it's the word that's
[1:08:03] being sounded out the character of life
[1:08:07] that is actually being sounded out that
[1:08:10] gets the attention of those that are
[1:08:12] wrote in the lamb's book of life
[1:08:15] it has a meaning to our life this is why
[1:08:18] the response the response is not
[1:08:21] something within us that just well this
[1:08:23] sounds good or this makes sense it goes
[1:08:26] much deeper than that
[1:08:28] it's more than just something that makes
[1:08:30] sense it becomes a life that you can't
[1:08:34] explain neither is it something that
[1:08:36] you're trying to live but now it's
[1:08:39] christ inside of you living out his own
[1:08:42] life that's what the real new birth is
[1:08:46] it's not our struggle to live right no
[1:08:49] it is a yielding to the life within us
[1:08:53] are you hearing me
[1:08:55] that's where the battle's got to get
[1:08:56] stopped first the war's got to get
[1:08:59] stopped right there in the soul
[1:09:02] well i don't do this and i don't do that
[1:09:05] but if you still have the desire to do
[1:09:07] it you're still not right god comes down
[1:09:10] to deal with the desire so we're not
[1:09:13] living under that part of fear but now
[1:09:15] the desire within is to completely
[1:09:19] please him
[1:09:22] oh my that's what the spirit of god he
[1:09:24] comes down within our life to continue
[1:09:27] the same ministry that he started and i
[1:09:29] just say it like this that ministry
[1:09:31] never changed
[1:09:35] that ministry god never intended that
[1:09:38] that ministry would ever change it's the
[1:09:40] same ministry
[1:09:41] it's the ministry of the lord jesus
[1:09:43] christ and what he did in that earthly
[1:09:47] body he does in this same body
[1:09:52] same lord jesus now notice he said and
[1:09:55] he said i will be with you to the end of
[1:09:57] the world things that i do shall you
[1:09:59] also unto the end of the world and he
[1:10:01] said now to the newcomers
[1:10:03] find out what he did what did he do did
[1:10:05] he claim that he was a great healer
[1:10:07] bring me this man let me show you you
[1:10:09] how i heal them that wasn't god that
[1:10:12] wasn't christ no no he said i can do
[1:10:15] nothing
[1:10:16] in myself
[1:10:19] but he said it's not me that doeth the
[1:10:21] works the father that dwelleth in me he
[1:10:25] doeth the works
[1:10:27] so then the works would be that of the
[1:10:29] word
[1:10:30] being expressed in our life
[1:10:33] where it's not us trying to live
[1:10:36] according to the word let me just stop
[1:10:38] here just for a moment there are things
[1:10:40] that god can deal with a life no matter
[1:10:43] where you're at in your journey yes you
[1:10:45] should want to
[1:10:47] have your heart inclined to the word but
[1:10:49] what i'm trying to present you this
[1:10:51] morning is is that the new birth itself
[1:10:54] is more than our strength within it
[1:10:57] because let me tell you something the
[1:10:59] bible says in isaiah 40 that there is
[1:11:02] more strength that's needed than our
[1:11:04] natural strength because it says even
[1:11:06] the strength of the youth will faint
[1:11:11] oh if i had a stronger mind and a
[1:11:13] stronger resolution it's no match for
[1:11:15] the devil
[1:11:17] our strength is no match for the devil
[1:11:20] but his strength is perfect
[1:11:23] his strength is perfect
[1:11:25] his strength is what it is in our life
[1:11:28] that holds as an anchor it's a substance
[1:11:31] it's a reality it's his strength that
[1:11:33] moves on the inside of us
[1:11:36] i can do he says it's not me that doeth
[1:11:38] the works of the father that dwelleth in
[1:11:40] me notice the works that are being done
[1:11:43] is that word that's being expressed out
[1:11:46] of that life
[1:11:48] you see
[1:11:49] when we look at this in mark chapter 16
[1:11:52] verse 14. think of those works of the
[1:11:55] word being expressed through the life
[1:11:58] you know it's not something where we're
[1:11:59] looking at the word and i'm trying to do
[1:12:02] this and i'm really trying to do this
[1:12:04] but we recognize that it must be christ
[1:12:07] it must be the living god to fulfill
[1:12:10] this word in our life
[1:12:12] it's just like you know
[1:12:14] as a person as god begins to deal with
[1:12:17] that life and and they come along
[1:12:18] there's a portion of the word that then
[1:12:21] can begin to be expressed through
[1:12:22] justification sanctification and then on
[1:12:25] into the baptism of the holy ghost but
[1:12:28] the works of the word is that of christ
[1:12:31] expressing his own life through you and
[1:12:33] i in mark 16 verse 14 notice hear the
[1:12:36] lord jesus he's gathered them together
[1:12:39] and he said afterward he appeared unto
[1:12:41] the eleven as they set at me and abraded
[1:12:43] them with with their unbelief and
[1:12:45] hardness of heart because they believed
[1:12:48] not which had seen him after he was
[1:12:50] risen and he said unto them go ye into
[1:12:54] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:12:56] every creature brother ramble pick it up
[1:12:58] over and over he said he didn't say
[1:12:59] teach he said preach
[1:13:02] because the preaching is the
[1:13:04] demonstration of the power of god
[1:13:07] that'll move down into a life to bring
[1:13:10] real conviction
[1:13:12] and god will demonstrate himself in his
[1:13:16] word go into all the world and preach
[1:13:19] the gospel to every creature he that
[1:13:21] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:13:24] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:13:27] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:13:29] that believe in my name shall they cast
[1:13:32] out devils they shall speak with new
[1:13:35] tongues they shall take up servants and
[1:13:37] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:13:40] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:13:42] the sick and they shall recover so then
[1:13:46] after the lord had spoken unto them he
[1:13:49] was received up into heaven and sat down
[1:13:52] on the right hand of god and they went
[1:13:55] forth and preached everywhere the lord
[1:13:58] working with them and confirming the
[1:14:02] word with signs following
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:09] here here
[1:14:11] is the living god
[1:14:13] that has come down
[1:14:15] he's paid the price and now has send it
[1:14:17] up and we understand as believers we're
[1:14:20] not talking about a right hand like
[1:14:22] somebody has a right hand we're talking
[1:14:24] about power
[1:14:26] he said all power in heaven and earth is
[1:14:29] given unto me
[1:14:32] amen there's nothing above him
[1:14:36] there's nothing greater than him you
[1:14:38] know there's no circumstance no
[1:14:40] situation that's greater than jesus
[1:14:44] nothing is bigger than him
[1:14:46] he he he descended to the lower most
[1:14:49] parts of hell and he deposited
[1:14:52] sin and every accusation that can ever
[1:14:56] be laid upon you he deposited it right
[1:15:00] there in hell
[1:15:03] and he rose up on that easter morning
[1:15:06] and he had presented himself as the
[1:15:08] sacrifice there before the father and
[1:15:11] then he came back and he begins to
[1:15:14] gather there of his children and begins
[1:15:16] to rehearse the promise to them and then
[1:15:20] as
[1:15:21] they are receiving of that promise now
[1:15:24] it is the same god now dwelling in a
[1:15:28] mini-membered body
[1:15:31] satan thought he had problems when he
[1:15:34] was here remember he said i thought i
[1:15:36] had you when when when the lord jesus
[1:15:39] here descending there down into hell
[1:15:41] remember
[1:15:42] satan said i thought i had you when i
[1:15:45] got abel
[1:15:47] thought i had you when i got ezekiel
[1:15:50] why why did he think he had him because
[1:15:53] it was the spirit of christ in every one
[1:15:56] of them
[1:15:58] but jesus was the fullness
[1:16:01] of the godhead bodily it was not a part
[1:16:05] it was not a portion it was the very
[1:16:07] fullness of god himself come down
[1:16:12] it didn't take away from jeremiah didn't
[1:16:14] take away from ezekiel but his coming
[1:16:17] it further identified that their
[1:16:20] position of where they were all along
[1:16:23] they were standing in the sacrifice in
[1:16:27] their day in their age
[1:16:31] and he came
[1:16:32] at that appointed time and remember the
[1:16:35] same one where that that satan thought i
[1:16:39] had him i thought i've got him but now
[1:16:41] he says now i've got you but what satan
[1:16:45] failed to recognize is you're not just
[1:16:48] dealing with a man that has been born
[1:16:51] under sexual desire
[1:16:54] this blood did not come from sexual
[1:16:57] desire
[1:16:59] this is the blood of god
[1:17:02] that's why brother branham would drive
[1:17:04] it in in the very first part of the
[1:17:06] revelation of jesus christ and he would
[1:17:09] drive it in and he would say it so
[1:17:11] clearly he said it is the blood of god
[1:17:13] the blood of the lord the blood of
[1:17:15] christ he said don't let anybody tell
[1:17:17] you he's a second person or a third
[1:17:19] person or he's not god he said jesus is
[1:17:23] god
[1:17:25] because it's the blood that we are saved
[1:17:28] by
[1:17:31] if the prophet took that much time
[1:17:33] within that point and he would have
[1:17:35] strictly adjure you and i he says now
[1:17:38] that you've been delivered from that
[1:17:40] don't ever let anybody drag you back
[1:17:43] into creeds and traditions and dogmas of
[1:17:46] man again don't ever let that happen
[1:17:50] the blood makes us free men and women
[1:17:53] the blood pays the price for you and i
[1:17:57] that blood was shed that he could
[1:17:59] announce to satan when he showed up
[1:18:01] there in hell he could say my blood that
[1:18:04] is purchased
[1:18:06] everything
[1:18:07] is still hot upon the ground
[1:18:12] everything has been paid off every debt
[1:18:16] every lien
[1:18:17] you know what he was declaring that
[1:18:19] there is not one thing though the devil
[1:18:22] could try to say you've done this and
[1:18:24] you've done that you might have done
[1:18:26] that you might still be living in that
[1:18:28] but there's a blood right has already
[1:18:30] spoken that says i've already paid the
[1:18:33] price don't let the devil hold it over
[1:18:35] your head any longer what do i do
[1:18:38] receive your liberty
[1:18:42] amen that's why the whole report is the
[1:18:44] report of a finished work
[1:18:49] hallelujah jesus christ as he stood
[1:18:52] there
[1:18:53] oh my
[1:18:54] has here
[1:18:55] the
[1:18:56] son
[1:18:57] of almighty god
[1:19:00] standing there as a representation of
[1:19:03] all the adam lost in the fall has been
[1:19:06] restored
[1:19:08] i want you to listen to this this
[1:19:09] statement
[1:19:10] in the revelation of jesus christ
[1:19:13] brother braham said now i want you to
[1:19:14] remember this
[1:19:17] christ
[1:19:18] in
[1:19:19] the true church
[1:19:21] is a continuation
[1:19:23] of the book of acts
[1:19:26] this is important christ in
[1:19:30] in the true church
[1:19:32] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:19:35] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:19:38] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:19:40] into the church and defile it making it
[1:19:43] lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:19:47] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:19:50] his attempted destruction of god's
[1:19:52] people and the discrediting of god's
[1:19:55] word
[1:19:56] right down to the time he's cast into
[1:19:59] the lake of fire he fights that he
[1:20:01] cannot stand that he's trying to do what
[1:20:05] discredit the report
[1:20:10] satan is in opposition against the
[1:20:13] report
[1:20:16] he knows this is what satan knows
[1:20:19] satan's not a dummy
[1:20:22] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:20:25] revelation
[1:20:26] of the true church and what she is what
[1:20:29] she stands for and that she can do the
[1:20:32] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:20:36] army
[1:20:38] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:20:40] spirits within the framework of the
[1:20:42] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:20:45] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:20:48] spirit satan will be powerless before
[1:20:51] her he will be as definitely thwarted
[1:20:53] today as when christ withstood his every
[1:20:56] effort
[1:20:58] to gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:21:01] satan hates revelation
[1:21:03] but we love it with true revelation in
[1:21:07] our lives the gates of hell cannot
[1:21:11] prevail against us but we will prevail
[1:21:14] over them
[1:21:17] what is it that prevails it's his
[1:21:20] strength
[1:21:21] it's the revelation of jesus christ in
[1:21:26] our lives that's prevailing
[1:21:28] no matter what test comes your way no
[1:21:30] matter what trial comes your way no
[1:21:33] matter what situation comes your way
[1:21:35] listen they tried to boil the holy ghost
[1:21:38] out of john they put him in a vat they
[1:21:41] put him in the isle of patmos come on
[1:21:43] somebody
[1:21:44] you talk about oh i gotta have the right
[1:21:46] circumstance to serve god quit being a
[1:21:49] weakling and a yellow belly and just man
[1:21:51] up to the gospel and say jesus christ i
[1:21:54] need a real death in my life
[1:21:58] i need a real visitation because we're
[1:22:00] talking about men and women down through
[1:22:02] the scriptures they didn't have an easy
[1:22:05] path to hold it wasn't something that
[1:22:07] was just like everything rolled out for
[1:22:09] them they stood there with a ruggedness
[1:22:12] of faith they stood there because it was
[1:22:14] not their own strength it was the
[1:22:17] strength of almighty god
[1:22:21] we're going to stand in the presence
[1:22:23] someday of individuals like that let me
[1:22:25] just tell you something in standing in
[1:22:27] their presence you will see individuals
[1:22:30] that you'll say my they were weak but
[1:22:32] they were weak and earthly strength but
[1:22:34] the strength of god is what was on
[1:22:37] display in their lives
[1:22:41] are you with me
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:45] because the reality is i don't want to
[1:22:47] stand there and say you know what
[1:22:49] if things would have been easier in 2020
[1:22:51] and 2021 steve and i have stood like
[1:22:54] used to it
[1:22:56] nope
[1:22:57] come on friend we ain't going to stand
[1:22:58] there like that
[1:23:00] we're going to stand there like that
[1:23:02] it's standing there in the matter
[1:23:04] pressures and things come about our life
[1:23:08] but when it's just like in a marriage
[1:23:10] you don't enter into a marriage and
[1:23:11] think about oh my this guy might get
[1:23:14] ugly i mean she might get plump this
[1:23:16] might happen or that might happen if
[1:23:18] you're doing that you're thinking the
[1:23:20] wrong kind of thoughts you know that we
[1:23:22] are aware there might be tests and
[1:23:24] trials that will come down the road
[1:23:25] there are situations that will change
[1:23:28] but in the midst of that time your love
[1:23:30] grows greater because you didn't marry
[1:23:33] flesh you marry the character
[1:23:36] are you hearing me now we're talking
[1:23:38] about the lord jesus christ if all you
[1:23:41] can do is look at it and say all the
[1:23:42] hardships and i don't know if i can do
[1:23:44] this and i don't know if i can do that
[1:23:46] you need to fall in love with the lord
[1:23:48] jesus you're too in love with yourself
[1:23:51] oh lord
[1:23:53] if you ever fall in love with him you'll
[1:23:56] lose sight of yourself
[1:23:59] i'm talking about christ coming into the
[1:24:01] true church
[1:24:04] we can't put christ on and take him off
[1:24:07] put him on thursday take him off on
[1:24:09] friday put him on on sunday take him off
[1:24:12] on monday it's christ that is on display
[1:24:16] in the true church of the living god
[1:24:19] amen
[1:24:20] i tell you friends when we look at it
[1:24:22] that way you might look at your life and
[1:24:24] feel like well i don't feel like i've
[1:24:25] done much or i don't feel like i've done
[1:24:27] this or or whatever more but you look at
[1:24:29] your constancy
[1:24:31] constant standing upon the word of god
[1:24:34] standing there believing the word of god
[1:24:37] through thick and thin
[1:24:40] no matter if all hell breaks around
[1:24:42] breaks loose around you you're still
[1:24:43] standing there
[1:24:46] are you hearing me i'm talking about a
[1:24:48] strength i'm talking about the arm of
[1:24:50] the lord
[1:24:52] that you realize it's not i that's
[1:24:55] living it's christ that liveth in me
[1:25:00] glory be to god something that gives you
[1:25:02] strength to get up the next morning
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:07] oh my
[1:25:08] so this continuation
[1:25:10] it's the same lord jesus
[1:25:12] working through a mini membered body
[1:25:16] now i want you just to look at this here
[1:25:20] because
[1:25:21] when we take
[1:25:22] look here in the message the token
[1:25:24] brother brahma is dealing with this and
[1:25:25] he takes
[1:25:27] an awful lot of time as you know
[1:25:29] uh especially there in the message in
[1:25:31] jeffersonville that if you haven't
[1:25:33] listened to the message the token
[1:25:35] preaching 63 of september 1st
[1:25:38] i i would really encourage you to go
[1:25:39] back and listen to it again and if you
[1:25:41] just listen to it listen to it again
[1:25:44] there's a lot i'm drawing from here
[1:25:47] brother brahma goes back and i did goes
[1:25:49] back to exodus 12 and he remember where
[1:25:51] they were to take a lamb ever all the
[1:25:53] way through
[1:25:54] all the way through the scripture
[1:25:56] it is the innocent
[1:25:58] sacrifice that's provided
[1:26:01] for the guilty
[1:26:03] they did not provide for their own guilt
[1:26:06] when things when the fall took place in
[1:26:08] eden god
[1:26:10] slew an innocent one
[1:26:13] and threw the clothing
[1:26:14] so that they could come under that those
[1:26:16] garments and come in his presence
[1:26:18] all the way through
[1:26:20] it's been the sacrifice of an innocent
[1:26:23] one for the guilty
[1:26:25] and there in exodus 12 he said take
[1:26:28] the lamb
[1:26:30] slay the lamb and you take the blood and
[1:26:32] you put the blood
[1:26:34] upon the lentils of the doorpost
[1:26:37] now see everybody walking by that house
[1:26:41] knew
[1:26:42] that that home
[1:26:44] was under the blood
[1:26:46] is that because there was no guess like
[1:26:48] i wonder if
[1:26:49] the blood
[1:26:51] it was right there on the doorpost amen
[1:26:54] is that right
[1:26:55] it wasn't a guest they they had to apply
[1:26:57] it they had to do that
[1:27:00] moses gave the message
[1:27:02] god gave to moses but they had to take
[1:27:05] that message
[1:27:06] then they had to apply it
[1:27:09] there's only one way to escape the
[1:27:11] judgment you've got to apply it
[1:27:14] is that right
[1:27:16] now notice he's talking back to that
[1:27:18] time he says now a blood
[1:27:20] identified the believer so when they
[1:27:22] could come by the door oh there there's
[1:27:24] a believer how do you know because the
[1:27:25] blood's on the door
[1:27:27] so it identified the believer because
[1:27:29] the life had gone out and could not come
[1:27:32] back so he had to have a chemistry he
[1:27:34] had to have like a paint a blood a
[1:27:37] chemistry that showed that life went out
[1:27:39] see how god would start with that of the
[1:27:41] blood because there had to be
[1:27:44] the blood provided to pay the ransom
[1:27:49] before the life could ever come now
[1:27:51] notice this he says now
[1:27:54] he had to have like a paint a blood a
[1:27:56] chemistry that showed that life went
[1:27:57] from it now the very spirit itself is
[1:28:00] the token
[1:28:01] the holy spirit itself is the token not
[1:28:04] the blood
[1:28:06] the blood was shed at calvary that's
[1:28:08] true but the blood as far as it is went
[1:28:11] back into the elements from which it
[1:28:12] came
[1:28:13] from the food that he lived on but you
[1:28:15] see inside that blood cell was a life
[1:28:18] that started the blood cell to moving
[1:28:22] the chemistry had no life in it itself
[1:28:26] and therefore it could not move
[1:28:28] but when the life come into the
[1:28:31] chemistry of the blood it formed a cell
[1:28:35] it formed its own cell then cell after
[1:28:38] cell then it become a man and that man
[1:28:41] was god emmanuel in flesh
[1:28:45] but when the life returned back the
[1:28:47] chemistry went out
[1:28:50] now notice he says but the token is the
[1:28:53] holy ghost upon the church that they
[1:28:57] see
[1:28:58] christ
[1:29:01] that they see
[1:29:03] christ
[1:29:04] so we're not walking around upon our
[1:29:06] lives and now i've got blood smeared
[1:29:08] upon me no it's the chemistry went back
[1:29:12] to the earth the chemistry that blood
[1:29:16] was the ransom he had to remember the
[1:29:19] bible in isaiah 53 he shall make his
[1:29:22] soul and offering for sin
[1:29:26] everything was settled right there there
[1:29:29] had to be a payment a ransom made and
[1:29:33] the debt was settled
[1:29:36] is that right now the same holy spirit
[1:29:40] that lived and formed that blood cells
[1:29:43] the same god
[1:29:44] that was there in that body
[1:29:47] is the same god that then came into his
[1:29:52] earthly body body of believers and
[1:29:55] begins to sound out the same liberty
[1:30:00] they see christ oh i love that
[1:30:04] mama
[1:30:06] it has to be because a woman and her
[1:30:09] husband become one they become one and
[1:30:13] so does the bride and christ
[1:30:15] become one the ministry of the bride and
[1:30:18] the ministry of christ
[1:30:20] is the
[1:30:21] same
[1:30:23] if there's any difference
[1:30:26] it's not the ministry
[1:30:27] of the bride
[1:30:29] and it's not the ministry of jesus
[1:30:31] christ
[1:30:32] it cannot change at all
[1:30:36] now remember he refers back to acts 1 1.
[1:30:39] these former treaties of theophilus have
[1:30:41] i wrote to you that jesus began to begin
[1:30:44] to do and continues to do his death
[1:30:47] didn't stop him no sir he returned again
[1:30:52] not a third person but the same person
[1:30:55] returned again in the form of the holy
[1:30:57] ghost and to continue the work on and
[1:31:00] continues on said the book of acts jesus
[1:31:04] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:31:06] forever that's the token that's the sign
[1:31:10] amen
[1:31:12] it's the same god
[1:31:15] moved back into
[1:31:17] an earthly body
[1:31:20] the same person returned in the form of
[1:31:21] the holy ghost to continue the work out
[1:31:24] now notice to continue the work on and
[1:31:26] continues on said the book of acts
[1:31:29] now in first corinthians 12 12
[1:31:32] for as the body is one
[1:31:35] and half many members
[1:31:37] and all the members of that one body
[1:31:39] being many are one body so also is
[1:31:42] christ
[1:31:44] remember he said upon this rock
[1:31:47] i will
[1:31:48] build
[1:31:49] my church
[1:31:51] not peter
[1:31:53] he couldn't build his church on the
[1:31:55] shifting sands of man
[1:31:58] he can't build it upon the sexual birth
[1:32:02] he only builds his church
[1:32:04] by that of the new birth
[1:32:07] by that of himself coming in
[1:32:09] and bringing out in our lives what is
[1:32:12] always there
[1:32:15] for as the body is one and half many
[1:32:17] members and all the members of that one
[1:32:19] body being many are one body so also is
[1:32:21] christ for by one spirit are we all
[1:32:24] baptized into one body
[1:32:27] oh my i love that
[1:32:29] you see
[1:32:30] their their takes
[1:32:31] uh as far as the brothers
[1:32:34] we sit here by our own strength and put
[1:32:36] people down in the water and bring them
[1:32:37] up
[1:32:39] there's not one person
[1:32:41] there's not one man
[1:32:43] nobody can baptize somebody into christ
[1:32:48] this is a work of baptism that he does
[1:32:52] personally it's a personal experience
[1:32:59] and this baptism is not like this
[1:33:01] because here a person can be baptized
[1:33:03] right here
[1:33:05] and you know
[1:33:06] maybe they don't go on
[1:33:08] they come they go in the water
[1:33:10] and they come up our lord showing a
[1:33:12] clear conscience towards god
[1:33:14] but when you are baptized by the spirit
[1:33:16] of god you're no longer the same person
[1:33:22] you see we're talking about something
[1:33:23] different than just an anointing
[1:33:26] we're talking about the holy ghost that
[1:33:27] comes upon that word that makes that
[1:33:29] word live
[1:33:32] where our life begins to dovetail with
[1:33:34] the word is that right for by one spirit
[1:33:38] we are all baptized into one body let me
[1:33:40] just as it's coming to my mind you know
[1:33:42] the word baptized there i like how the
[1:33:44] uh many of you heard this many many
[1:33:47] times but it's like you take the example
[1:33:49] that they'll give
[1:33:51] in this word is like you take a cucumber
[1:33:54] how many of you like pickles
[1:33:56] man i like them
[1:33:57] not sweet ones but i like deals
[1:34:01] that was opinion that one does sayeth
[1:34:03] the lord that's just so you understand
[1:34:05] that
[1:34:08] but i've never taken a cucumber and said
[1:34:10] i want a pickle on my hamburger and took
[1:34:12] that cucumber and cut it up it's not a
[1:34:14] pickle
[1:34:16] are you hearing me
[1:34:18] i don't want it
[1:34:19] i want a pickle
[1:34:21] well brother sammy you know what a
[1:34:22] pickle is
[1:34:23] no it's not a pickle is a pickle
[1:34:28] it once was a cucumber
[1:34:33] but once it's gone through the hot water
[1:34:36] still is a cucumber
[1:34:38] is that right it's been baptized in that
[1:34:40] hot water still a cucumber
[1:34:43] whoa can come out of the hot water
[1:34:46] still a cucumber
[1:34:50] but once it goes
[1:34:52] into
[1:34:54] the vinegar
[1:34:55] once it goes into the solution
[1:34:58] it changes it
[1:35:00] it's no longer a cucumber
[1:35:03] it's a pickle
[1:35:06] never can be a cucumber again
[1:35:09] that's what the genuine baptism on the
[1:35:13] holy ghost does
[1:35:15] it doesn't leave you of the world it
[1:35:18] changes your life forever
[1:35:24] that's why we are new creatures
[1:35:28] in christ jesus
[1:35:30] for the body is not one member but many
[1:35:33] notice he talking about the body
[1:35:35] now when you look at this how brother
[1:35:38] rams ask this question the question
[1:35:39] answers on the seals and i want to get
[1:35:41] to to a place here
[1:35:44] he said is the bride of christ
[1:35:46] and the body of christ the same good
[1:35:48] question
[1:35:50] is the bride of christ and the body of
[1:35:52] christ the same he said yes sir
[1:35:55] now brother brad said you know i don't
[1:35:56] want to get started well i'll start
[1:35:57] preaching a sermon on this but i want to
[1:35:59] show you when god gave adam his bride
[1:36:02] from his side he said she is flesh of my
[1:36:05] flesh and bone of my bone when god give
[1:36:08] christ his bride look at these words
[1:36:11] when god give christ his bride the
[1:36:14] spirit gave the flesh
[1:36:17] the bride
[1:36:19] so it's the spirit of god
[1:36:21] that has went forth to deal with our
[1:36:24] life call us to repentance
[1:36:27] that's that's a work of the holy ghost
[1:36:29] and then the holy spirit works in our
[1:36:32] life to do what brings sanctification
[1:36:36] is that right then the same spirit of
[1:36:38] god works in our life to come into a
[1:36:41] place of complete death
[1:36:44] now he steps in to unite with that seed
[1:36:49] that was there all along
[1:36:52] amen
[1:36:54] what's the what's done that the spirit
[1:36:56] so now it's not listen to me now the
[1:36:59] flesh itself
[1:37:01] the flesh itself only becomes the
[1:37:04] visible
[1:37:05] the visible part to declare that the
[1:37:09] invisible god is there
[1:37:12] so the flesh is only declares the
[1:37:15] amorphy of god
[1:37:17] where has god in morphed at god sets
[1:37:19] down in that of the seed the seed is
[1:37:23] quickened we were dead
[1:37:26] this is why brother baby tells us he
[1:37:28] says that soul that come from god that's
[1:37:31] the real gift
[1:37:33] because it's that that receives you see
[1:37:36] it receives the life of god god does not
[1:37:39] come down and clean up our old nature
[1:37:41] and say you know what i'm gonna make
[1:37:43] mark a good guy then i'll come and unite
[1:37:45] with him you can't make mark a good guy
[1:37:48] i don't care how you beautify him up
[1:37:50] richie samuel dave paul any of you i
[1:37:53] won't call sister's name because i want
[1:37:55] things to be good but you understand you
[1:37:57] can't beautify it up good enough for
[1:37:59] jesus to say yep it's good enough it has
[1:38:02] to come to a place of death
[1:38:07] to where it dies to that old nature and
[1:38:10] then that seed that's been laying there
[1:38:13] dormant the whole time lacking genesis 1
[1:38:17] underneath the darkness and void and
[1:38:19] then he comes by his spirit and he
[1:38:22] raises up that life on the inside and
[1:38:25] you can say i am a new creation in
[1:38:29] christ jesus
[1:38:31] because he unites with his word what is
[1:38:34] his word himself
[1:38:38] he comes to unite with himself
[1:38:42] [Applause]
[1:38:44] what did that the spirit presents christ
[1:38:48] his bride so this is why that even on
[1:38:51] our natural body
[1:38:53] my hands
[1:38:54] are to glorify him
[1:38:58] even my earthly body is to be yielded as
[1:39:01] members to in righteousness
[1:39:03] is that right
[1:39:06] things that maybe you know used to come
[1:39:08] out of here even things sometimes they
[1:39:10] enter their and you say man i'm going to
[1:39:12] tell son and all of a sudden here the
[1:39:13] spirit of god are raised
[1:39:18] why because you are bought with a price
[1:39:23] you're not your own you are on the slave
[1:39:26] market
[1:39:27] come on we were a slave to sin
[1:39:30] but there's one who came and he bought
[1:39:33] us
[1:39:34] from the market took us out of the
[1:39:36] market and the spirit of god places us
[1:39:40] in him you can never be sold into
[1:39:44] slavery again
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:47] you're free
[1:39:51] the spirit of god
[1:39:53] it presents the bride
[1:39:56] so
[1:39:56] the bride is not the work of a church
[1:40:01] it takes the spirit of god he's the one
[1:40:04] assembling the many members
[1:40:07] of his body now not every member is the
[1:40:09] same
[1:40:10] feet hands on and on we can go no we
[1:40:13] know that in our own body but yet each
[1:40:14] one has its peculiarities
[1:40:18] god has set them in there particularly
[1:40:20] everything is to declare him my hand
[1:40:23] does not work against my body
[1:40:26] is that right
[1:40:27] my arm does not look over and say you
[1:40:29] know what
[1:40:31] you used me so much
[1:40:33] here you were out here the shovel you
[1:40:35] didn't use this guy
[1:40:37] you use the left one
[1:40:39] hear the right one lifting all this
[1:40:40] something lifting bricks up and
[1:40:41] everything else huh
[1:40:43] see this guy he can't go over there and
[1:40:45] say ah
[1:40:47] i'm not going with you
[1:40:48] tomorrow if he's part of my body he's
[1:40:51] going to go with me
[1:40:54] come on somebody
[1:40:56] you see when we've been baptized into
[1:40:57] the body of jesus christ the spirit
[1:41:00] brings us into a harmony we're not our
[1:41:03] own
[1:41:08] brother simon it's like you know i ever
[1:41:09] look at your hands and things like that
[1:41:11] sometimes you got certain toes that are
[1:41:12] crooked or certain fingers that are
[1:41:14] crooked man i can just straighten that
[1:41:15] thing out or maybe you got a nose that
[1:41:17] you want to reduce in size or you got
[1:41:18] something else or what i want to do this
[1:41:20] or i want to do that or i've done but
[1:41:21] you know what everything
[1:41:24] is placed there for a purpose
[1:41:28] and we need
[1:41:29] one another
[1:41:32] let me just be very very clear there
[1:41:34] might be things that well this is a
[1:41:36] little crooked or that's a little
[1:41:37] crooked that
[1:41:38] we need
[1:41:40] the christ
[1:41:42] in one another
[1:41:44] did you hear what i said we need the
[1:41:46] christ in one another we don't need
[1:41:48] everybody to be the same we don't need
[1:41:49] everybody to be brother joey or
[1:41:51] everybody to be brother we don't need
[1:41:52] that god don't want that
[1:41:55] we need the christ
[1:41:58] in one another
[1:42:01] now notice what jesus had said here in
[1:42:04] john 17 20 i want you to watch this this
[1:42:07] ministry here of the bride
[1:42:10] jesus said in john 17 20 neither pray i
[1:42:12] for these alone but for them also
[1:42:16] which shall believe on me through their
[1:42:19] word
[1:42:21] so this same word
[1:42:23] of liberty
[1:42:24] this same report
[1:42:26] is going to be sounding out through a
[1:42:29] body
[1:42:30] amen
[1:42:32] here he is intercessory prayer i'm not
[1:42:34] just praying for them but for those who
[1:42:36] will believe on their word
[1:42:42] that they may be one notice what this
[1:42:45] prayer is that they may be one
[1:42:48] as thou father see this is not a oneness
[1:42:50] that spoke of like well the pentecostals
[1:42:52] get together with the baptist and no no
[1:42:54] no that's ecumenical that's that's
[1:42:56] carnality of man
[1:42:58] this is the oneness that jesus spoke
[1:43:00] about that they all may be one as
[1:43:03] thou
[1:43:04] father art in me and i in thee that they
[1:43:08] also may be one in us
[1:43:11] that the world may believe
[1:43:13] that thou hast sent me
[1:43:17] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[1:43:20] have given them and that they may be one
[1:43:22] even as we are one
[1:43:24] i in them and thou in me that they may
[1:43:27] be made perfect in one and that the
[1:43:30] world look how it goes again that the
[1:43:32] world may know that thou has sent me and
[1:43:34] has loved them as thou hast loved me our
[1:43:38] lives he prayed for this oneness
[1:43:42] for that same life to be inside of you
[1:43:45] and i
[1:43:46] that what would that do that would
[1:43:48] vindicate that indeed that jesus christ
[1:43:52] is lord
[1:43:55] it would be it would be a declaration in
[1:43:57] our life you see it's more than just
[1:43:59] words
[1:44:00] it's what our life gives a testimony of
[1:44:03] where people ask and say hey where do
[1:44:05] you go to church at
[1:44:07] and you realize hey it's more than just
[1:44:09] church
[1:44:10] sure you want to bring you want them to
[1:44:12] come to a place where they can really
[1:44:14] hear the gospel not here uh follow these
[1:44:17] five steps to be a better you or or you
[1:44:19] know no you want to do where they come
[1:44:21] to a place to meet the lord jesus that
[1:44:24] they receive that same victory in their
[1:44:26] life you want them to meet the one that
[1:44:29] you've met and has changed your life
[1:44:32] and what better an example what better
[1:44:36] life than one who's a true
[1:44:38] witness
[1:44:42] it declares in our life that he is lord
[1:44:47] it declares that indeed he was a
[1:44:49] sacrifice
[1:44:51] our life declares that liberty that
[1:44:54] freedom that we live by
[1:44:56] now here peter let me just skip to a
[1:44:58] place here
[1:45:01] in acts chapter 2 i had the whole
[1:45:03] chapter but i've just i'll just move
[1:45:04] through a certain place
[1:45:07] here is peter
[1:45:08] he begins to sound out on the day of
[1:45:11] pentecost
[1:45:12] god
[1:45:13] coming to honor
[1:45:15] his word
[1:45:16] when the bible says when the day of
[1:45:18] pentecost was fully come i want you to
[1:45:20] think of this there were the bible says
[1:45:22] there were devout jews
[1:45:24] gathered from all nations
[1:45:27] to jerusalem
[1:45:29] what did they come there for
[1:45:30] the feast of pentecost
[1:45:33] what you think about this
[1:45:35] some of them
[1:45:36] gathered there under a form
[1:45:40] there were others gathering that day in
[1:45:43] an expectation
[1:45:45] for it to move from a type to the
[1:45:47] antitype to the real thing
[1:45:50] are you with me
[1:45:51] here they were all the jews there were
[1:45:53] jews from every nation how how god had
[1:45:56] it so fit in that hour jews that they
[1:45:59] those that this was their native
[1:46:01] language this was their native land and
[1:46:03] this was their pamphlet all those things
[1:46:05] that you can read in the scripture
[1:46:07] but when the holy ghost came
[1:46:10] the bible says
[1:46:11] it filled the not only the house where
[1:46:14] they were sitting
[1:46:16] but a cloven tongue of fire each of them
[1:46:19] received a lick of fire received a
[1:46:23] portion
[1:46:24] of god's own life and it sat upon them
[1:46:29] oh my there wasn't going to be a leaving
[1:46:31] it sat upon them it came to make alive
[1:46:35] the word and the promise
[1:46:37] they were now
[1:46:38] witnesses of the resurrection not by
[1:46:40] just what they had seen with their eyes
[1:46:42] but now in their own lives there was a
[1:46:44] witness that i was once dead
[1:46:48] but now i've been quickened
[1:46:50] my life has been changed completely that
[1:46:53] revelation of jesus christ was so deep
[1:46:56] in their life to where now when peter
[1:46:59] steps out there and all of these jews
[1:47:01] are gathered around he begins to declare
[1:47:05] to them from the scripture notice where
[1:47:08] the spirit of god took them are you
[1:47:10] hearing me the spirit of god didn't take
[1:47:12] him to a feeling
[1:47:14] we believe in feelings are you with me
[1:47:16] but he didn't take him to a well i know
[1:47:18] this is this because of this feeling no
[1:47:20] no no what happened to him brought him
[1:47:22] right into the word because it was a
[1:47:25] word experience
[1:47:28] come on friends a real genuine holy
[1:47:31] ghost experience will never deny the
[1:47:35] word
[1:47:36] it'll never back up from the word it'll
[1:47:39] never make excuses around the word but a
[1:47:42] real true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:47:45] unites us with jesus christ in the same
[1:47:50] ministry of his power and glory
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:54] the spirit of god raised up in them just
[1:47:57] like it did when jesus said the spirit
[1:47:59] of the lord is upon me peter was
[1:48:02] declaring in that time what you're
[1:48:04] wondering about and you're wondering are
[1:48:06] they drunk but i want to let you know
[1:48:09] this is that which joe prophesied
[1:48:15] what authority did he have he had
[1:48:17] authority from on high
[1:48:20] he was declaring the report of the lord
[1:48:27] the rest of them here they are what did
[1:48:28] they say
[1:48:30] man
[1:48:33] we know these are all galileans
[1:48:36] why their dialect betrayed them
[1:48:40] is that right
[1:48:41] just like somebody you know how y'all
[1:48:44] their dialect betrays them man
[1:48:47] or somebody they want some water or some
[1:48:48] quarter or your dialect betrays you
[1:48:51] you're with me
[1:48:53] you betrayed where you're from their
[1:48:55] dialect betrayed them as galileans but
[1:48:58] remember it was not that of a galilean
[1:49:01] voice
[1:49:02] it was that of god's voice sounding
[1:49:05] throughout their lives they weren't
[1:49:07] speaking in a different tongue they were
[1:49:09] speaking in their own tongue but the
[1:49:12] spirit of god was interpreting in their
[1:49:15] hearing how hear we
[1:49:18] every man in our own tongue
[1:49:22] the miracle wasn't the speaking
[1:49:26] the miracle was the hearing
[1:49:30] when the priests rode the land in the
[1:49:32] jubilee the miracle wasn't the sounding
[1:49:36] the miracle was the hearing
[1:49:40] where those who were bound could hear
[1:49:43] this is my liberty
[1:49:45] this is my freedom
[1:49:50] let him not happen here hear what the
[1:49:52] spirit said to the church
[1:49:56] glory be to god
[1:49:59] they identify these wonderful works of
[1:50:01] god that are being expressed we hear
[1:50:04] them
[1:50:05] we we hear the wonderful works of
[1:50:07] almighty god
[1:50:09] oh man i think of how that peter oh i
[1:50:11] love how the bible speaks of how he
[1:50:13] lifted up his voice and i just got to
[1:50:16] keep on going but peter comes into this
[1:50:18] place in acts 2 29 and i must read this
[1:50:21] one to you he said men and brethren let
[1:50:24] me
[1:50:25] freely speak
[1:50:26] unto you
[1:50:28] of the patriarch david that he is both
[1:50:30] dead and buried and his sepulcher is
[1:50:33] with us today
[1:50:35] therefore being a prophet and knowing
[1:50:37] that god has sworn with an oath to him
[1:50:40] that of the fruit of his loins according
[1:50:42] to the flesh he would raise up christ to
[1:50:44] sit on his throne he's seeing this
[1:50:47] before spake of the resurrection of
[1:50:49] christ that his soul was not left in
[1:50:52] hell neither his flesh did see
[1:50:54] corruption let me just say what did this
[1:50:56] this one let me tell you who's the one
[1:50:58] speaking here earthly speaking this man
[1:51:01] couldn't read his name on a boxcar
[1:51:03] are you hearing me this is not the
[1:51:06] intellect of peter lining up prophecies
[1:51:09] it's the spirit of god oh brother saying
[1:51:12] i don't understand this i don't
[1:51:13] understand that don't let the devil
[1:51:15] waste your time trying to get you around
[1:51:17] i don't understand this don't understand
[1:51:19] that but do exactly what the prophet
[1:51:21] said pray for
[1:51:23] revelation
[1:51:25] it's not our natural mind that makes
[1:51:27] sense of it it takes the spirit of god
[1:51:31] who directed peter to the word the
[1:51:33] spirit of god directed him to the word
[1:51:38] hallelujah
[1:51:40] there's men are you with me the
[1:51:41] pharisees those men knew the prophecies
[1:51:45] and yet they could look at a prophecy
[1:51:47] being fulfilled and call it bl's above
[1:51:50] you're a samaritan that has a devil it
[1:51:52] showed that learning and intellect and
[1:51:55] reading and theology will never be what
[1:51:58] god accepts
[1:52:01] i'll tell you this it brings it down to
[1:52:03] this right here it wouldn't matter if
[1:52:04] you're that if you're illiterate it
[1:52:06] wouldn't matter if you can't read it
[1:52:08] wouldn't matter nothing like that at all
[1:52:10] what it comes down to it takes the holy
[1:52:12] spirit of god to come and to reveal
[1:52:16] himself to you in the word
[1:52:19] oh it takes it away from a church it
[1:52:21] puts it back into the hands of the lamb
[1:52:23] of almighty god i tell you that ought to
[1:52:26] change the way that we pray about things
[1:52:28] it changes the way we try to go about
[1:52:30] handling things it's not us brother and
[1:52:33] sister but let's look to the god who can
[1:52:36] direct in the word who fulfills his word
[1:52:39] who brings his word to pass let's invite
[1:52:41] him the arm of the lord to break every
[1:52:44] power to shatter every chain to deliver
[1:52:47] all the oppressed amen to loosen our
[1:52:49] children
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:53] are you with me this morning
[1:52:57] hallelujah
[1:52:59] and here's what peter could say
[1:53:01] this jesus
[1:53:03] hath god raised up
[1:53:06] whereof we all are witnesses
[1:53:09] therefore being by the right hand of god
[1:53:12] exalted
[1:53:13] and having received of the father the
[1:53:15] promise of the holy ghost he
[1:53:18] hath shed forth this
[1:53:21] which ye now see
[1:53:24] and here
[1:53:27] what was it the report
[1:53:30] the same life
[1:53:32] that lived in the earthen tabernacle
[1:53:36] the creation
[1:53:38] of god
[1:53:40] now that same life
[1:53:42] lives
[1:53:44] in the continuation
[1:53:46] of the creation
[1:53:48] of god
[1:53:51] lives that are created
[1:53:53] anew
[1:53:54] by the holy ghost
[1:53:59] you might say as a sister my i don't
[1:54:00] seem like i can put the word together
[1:54:03] and seem like i can do this and do that
[1:54:05] don't don't don't busy yourself with
[1:54:06] that even as a brother well i don't know
[1:54:09] if i can don't busy yourself with that
[1:54:10] what do i busy myself just say lord let
[1:54:13] my life be such
[1:54:14] an example
[1:54:17] let my life be a place that you
[1:54:20] can display yourself
[1:54:24] because it
[1:54:25] people are not after doctrine
[1:54:27] they want
[1:54:29] reality
[1:54:30] they want to know the lord jesus christ
[1:54:33] the one
[1:54:34] who can take their life and transform it
[1:54:38] people are tired of church
[1:54:40] they don't want church i don't blame
[1:54:42] them i don't want church either
[1:54:44] we want the lord jesus christ
[1:54:48] he's more than life to us
[1:54:52] hallelujah
[1:54:53] and peter could say
[1:54:56] he could say in this manner when they it
[1:54:58] was done speaking in verse 37
[1:55:01] when they heard this
[1:55:03] they were pricked
[1:55:05] in their heart
[1:55:08] see the the word proclaiming liberty
[1:55:11] it identified
[1:55:13] the condition they were in
[1:55:15] by making them known this is what god
[1:55:19] intends you to be
[1:55:21] it brought conviction to their heart
[1:55:24] and here's what they asked
[1:55:26] what
[1:55:27] shall
[1:55:29] we
[1:55:30] do
[1:55:33] peter gave the great prescription
[1:55:38] repent
[1:55:40] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:55:42] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:55:44] of sins
[1:55:47] and ye
[1:55:48] shall
[1:55:50] receive
[1:55:51] the gift
[1:55:53] of the holy ghost
[1:55:55] for the promise is unto you
[1:55:58] and to your children and to all that are
[1:56:00] far off even as many as the lord are
[1:56:03] god's call
[1:56:05] and with many other words did he testify
[1:56:07] and exhort saying
[1:56:09] save yourselves from this upward
[1:56:11] generation
[1:56:13] then they that gladly received his word
[1:56:18] were baptized
[1:56:20] and the same they were added unto them
[1:56:21] about three thousand
[1:56:23] souls
[1:56:26] the word
[1:56:28] went forth
[1:56:31] not all responded
[1:56:33] as a matter of fact some of them
[1:56:35] they mocked them
[1:56:37] they laughed at them
[1:56:39] but there were others that when the word
[1:56:42] was sounding out
[1:56:44] it pricked their heart
[1:56:47] it dealt with their heart you see this
[1:56:49] is what the spirit of god does it deals
[1:56:51] with our heart
[1:56:53] it doesn't come by look he's not the
[1:56:55] spirit of god's not a condemning spirit
[1:56:57] but he comes to let you and i know
[1:57:01] you can be free
[1:57:02] and not you can be but it's to tell you
[1:57:05] you're free
[1:57:06] it's to accept what the liberty
[1:57:10] in christ jesus
[1:57:13] to accept that liberty and he announces
[1:57:15] that there they were moved you see this
[1:57:17] is why it takes the spirit of god just
[1:57:20] moving throughout the life you live the
[1:57:23] ministering of the word as it goes forth
[1:57:25] all of these parts is to bring about
[1:57:27] that pricking of the heart the
[1:57:29] conviction because if a man is never
[1:57:31] convicted he's wrong
[1:57:33] he can never get right
[1:57:36] is that right
[1:57:37] this is why the scripture said that the
[1:57:39] backslider is right in all of his ways
[1:57:42] right
[1:57:43] in his ways
[1:57:44] his own ways he justifies everything
[1:57:46] he's got everything's right this is
[1:57:48] right this is right this is right this
[1:57:49] is right this is wrong this all those
[1:57:51] things but when a man
[1:57:54] has come in contact with god
[1:57:56] and it can see
[1:57:58] his life
[1:57:59] to see where it's at
[1:58:01] and what god has called him to be
[1:58:04] and then can accept it can accept and
[1:58:06] just literally just like i have this
[1:58:08] handkerchief here you let go of sin just
[1:58:10] like that
[1:58:11] how do i let go of it repentance
[1:58:14] it's like real true repentance is dying
[1:58:17] out to
[1:58:18] self amen then the promise is sure
[1:58:22] it's always been sure you shall receive
[1:58:24] the gift
[1:58:26] of the holy ghost
[1:58:27] think of that same report that same
[1:58:29] report sounds out right here
[1:58:31] this morning
[1:58:32] many you know i think of when brother
[1:58:35] brother dave
[1:58:36] junior stood up here
[1:58:38] a couple weeks ago and gave the
[1:58:39] testimony regarding his mom sister
[1:58:41] shirley
[1:58:42] and brother dave has given testimony
[1:58:45] each each time
[1:58:46] but some of the things you don't you
[1:58:48] know you don't even realize that people
[1:58:50] sometimes are all together going through
[1:58:52] you don't realize as they as they've
[1:58:53] been sitting here
[1:58:55] sitting here is probably many many of us
[1:58:56] i know this that for many of the servers
[1:58:58] before it was sitting here in pain
[1:59:01] all sorts of discomfort
[1:59:03] not just for days
[1:59:05] now this isn't lifting sister shirley up
[1:59:07] but i'm just talking to you about the
[1:59:09] caliber and the quality of the life
[1:59:12] that's there
[1:59:13] are you hearing me
[1:59:15] we're talking about but it goes
[1:59:16] throughout this assembly
[1:59:18] when i i could right now it could stand
[1:59:21] right now and say
[1:59:22] if you if god has touched your body and
[1:59:25] healed you stand to your feet there's no
[1:59:28] doubt throughout this building right
[1:59:29] here
[1:59:30] i don't think there'd be one sitting
[1:59:32] down
[1:59:33] what is that that's a witness
[1:59:36] of the report
[1:59:39] i could ask in this building how many
[1:59:41] have received the holy ghost could stand
[1:59:44] and be as a testimony that my life has
[1:59:48] been changed
[1:59:50] and i am united with jesus christ i'm no
[1:59:53] longer the same person
[1:59:56] amen my life has been changed what is it
[1:59:59] it's a witness of the report
[2:00:03] somebody's been delivered and they can
[2:00:05] stand and say
[2:00:07] i once i once was bound but now i'm free
[2:00:09] what is it it's a witness of the report
[2:00:12] now let me just say that
[2:00:14] that witness of the report
[2:00:16] in lives throughout this building
[2:00:18] is something to bring courage to each
[2:00:21] and every one
[2:00:23] no matter where you're at in your
[2:00:25] journey
[2:00:26] i want you to understand that there is
[2:00:28] no flesh in this building that is
[2:00:31] greater than another flesh
[2:00:35] there's not one person here that's
[2:00:37] greater than another person there's only
[2:00:39] one great one among us
[2:00:42] and that's the lord jesus christ
[2:00:45] and simply put what he did for others
[2:00:49] he'll do for you
[2:00:51] he's the same
[2:00:52] yesterday today
[2:00:55] and forever
[2:00:57] that's why you can pray for your
[2:00:59] children and have the confidence that
[2:01:02] the same god that changed me because you
[2:01:04] knew five steps to a better you wouldn't

[2:01:22] husband or wife or you're the same

[2:10:32] amen it all it's what it all boils down
[2:10:34] to
[2:10:35] is that it's the life of jesus christ
[2:10:38] on display
[2:10:40] in our lives
[2:10:43] when the spirit of truth has come he'll
[2:10:45] lead and guide us into all truth
[2:10:48] he guides us into
[2:10:50] into all truth he directs us just
[2:10:55] just as he came
[2:10:57] drew the disciples who were wandering
[2:10:59] they were kind of going their own way
[2:11:03] but here he came as the great shepherd
[2:11:05] and he began to
[2:11:06] gather him up
[2:11:08] and then he began to make known the
[2:11:10] promise to him
[2:11:12] and then as he made known
[2:11:14] the promise to him here they are
[2:11:17] gathered
[2:11:18] in
[2:11:19] to christ
[2:11:21] it was him
[2:11:22] drawing
[2:11:23] his children together
[2:11:26] so then their lives remember when they
[2:11:28] would look at even see peter in them the
[2:11:30] bible said they took knowledge
[2:11:32] they were ignorant and unlearned
[2:11:35] is that right they could look at them
[2:11:37] and say these are ignorant and unlearned
[2:11:39] men
[2:11:39] but they took knowledge
[2:11:41] they had been
[2:11:43] with jesus
[2:11:46] his life
[2:11:48] was so impressed upon their life
[2:11:51] until they knew
[2:11:52] they've been with jesus
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:11:55] it just there's a difference he makes in
[2:11:57] our life can you say amen
[2:11:59] he's the one who makes the difference
[2:12:02] just as the spirit of truth guided them
[2:12:04] into the promise then look what had
[2:12:06] happened as we seen here in the
[2:12:07] scriptures
[2:12:08] it guides them right into identifying
[2:12:10] what took place
[2:12:12] was joel 2.
[2:12:14] what david spoke by the spirit of god
[2:12:16] this is what is taking place see the
[2:12:18] spirit of truth guided them into all
[2:12:21] truth
[2:12:23] amen this is what the same holy spirit
[2:12:25] that's what it does in me and you
[2:12:27] it guides us
[2:12:28] into all truth
[2:12:30] is that right it guides us into the word
[2:12:33] and we can look and see the word
[2:12:36] coming to pass in our own life
[2:12:39] sometimes it's hard to see
[2:12:41] but then sometimes you get alone with
[2:12:43] god in prayer and you can
[2:12:45] you see things in your life you know
[2:12:46] you're not the same but then you see
[2:12:48] things that god will point out sometimes
[2:12:49] in prayer
[2:12:51] some things you're praying about and god
[2:12:53] makes known to you
[2:12:54] this is what was taken place in your
[2:12:56] life
[2:12:59] it's me that's holding
[2:13:00] you it's me
[2:13:03] my victory coming through your life and
[2:13:05] then
[2:13:06] lord hear the very thing i'm praying
[2:13:08] about is coming to pass
[2:13:11] but you know it happens
[2:13:13] so simply
[2:13:16] it happens in our life and it's not
[2:13:17] something that we're aware of
[2:13:19] that it when it's happening
[2:13:21] but after it happens
[2:13:24] he makes it known
[2:13:27] it's jesus he's alive and well
