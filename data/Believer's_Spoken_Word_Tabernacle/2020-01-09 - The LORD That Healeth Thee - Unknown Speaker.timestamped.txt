[33:56] to the Lord keep it up on your heart
[34:02] Heavenly Father or Jesus you are mindful
[34:11] of every single need
[34:15] Lord you've showed us in your word
[34:19] that there's no circumstance nor
[34:21] condition that's too small or
[34:26] insignificant you took Lourdes in this
[34:31] hour to show us Lord where the Prophet
[34:37] he was out fishing that little fish Lord
[34:42] brother branham described it as a fish
[34:44] he said that barely it was like skin
[34:46] over a hook they pulled that hook out
[34:51] God as brother Brown described it
[34:53] everything within that little fish came
[34:56] out it looked like the sentence of death
[35:00] had struck it
[35:03] there was no more life within it even
[35:07] one that stood there Lord in the boat
[35:09] and said little fishy
[35:10] I guess you've shot your last one but
[35:14] father at that moment Lord you moved
[35:16] down and you spoke little fishy I'll
[35:22] give you back your life you showed us
[35:26] Lord that beyond all false beyond what
[35:31] all that our minds could even conceive
[35:34] Lord the Word of God prevails
[35:37] there's an old situation there's no
[35:41] circumstance that's too great for you
[35:47] father we ask tonight that Lord that you
[35:53] would pass by our way that you would
[35:56] take your word to speak personally to
[35:59] our lives you know every need you know
[36:03] what we have need of an Lord you know
[36:07] just how to say it we pray the Lord and
[36:11] for every need Lord behind every hand
[36:14] and Lord he will move from a request a
[36:18] need to that of a testimony Lord God
[36:23] that would be edifying Lord not only to
[36:26] that believer with their hand lifted up
[36:28] but fathered to the entire body of Jesus
[36:31] Christ granite
[36:34] may you come and just speak to us
[36:37] through your word we give ourselves to
[36:40] you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[36:45] amen
[36:47] let's go in the word tonight Bibles to
[36:51] Exodus 15 and I want to go back into
[36:55] this portion of scripture here see how
[37:01] the Lord will take us
[37:07] just for sake of time this just started
[37:11] verse 25 of Exodus 15 where the people
[37:16] are at the waters of Marah and they
[37:20] cried unto Moses what shall we drink
[37:24] verse 25 it says of exodus 15 and he
[37:29] cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed
[37:33] him a tree which when he had cast into
[37:38] the waters the waters were made sweet
[37:41] there he made for them a statue and an
[37:44] ordinance and there he proved and said
[37:48] if thou will diligently hearken to the
[37:52] voice of the LORD thy God and will do
[37:55] that which is right in his sight and
[37:57] will give ear to His commandments and
[38:00] keep all his statutes I will put none of
[38:04] these diseases upon thee which I have
[38:07] brought upon the Egyptians for I am the
[38:10] Lord that he loved thee amen we're in
[38:15] the scriptures that he God has never
[38:18] forsaken no matter what situation arises
[38:21] God is is present to deal with that
[38:25] situation our experiences in our life
[38:28] you know a testimony is not something
[38:30] that is given to any of us a testimony
[38:34] is not something that can be handed to
[38:37] us we receive truly the testimony of
[38:40] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost by the new
[38:42] birth but there is an outworking within
[38:45] our life it's a working of our own
[38:48] personal testimony where the life of
[38:51] Jesus Christ is present there's tests
[38:54] there's trials there's things that comes
[38:56] our way and all are part of those
[38:58] experiences where by God he will prove
[39:01] his faithfulness to his word to our
[39:04] lives there's things that maybe you can
[39:07] look back in your life and say why did I
[39:09] make this decision
[39:11] you maybe can see things in your life
[39:12] where you see a decision you made and
[39:14] you say well I don't see anything that
[39:16] is productive or that is godly or that
[39:19] really come out of that but
[39:20] if you can really be reflective in the
[39:23] manner to look into your life and see
[39:26] that has there been growth in your life
[39:29] to where now you're even more sensitive
[39:31] to the decisions that are left before
[39:34] you there's things that you've you've
[39:36] grown from in your life you can all you
[39:38] can as like many of us we could try to
[39:41] say well I wish I wouldn't have made
[39:42] this decision I wish I would have done
[39:44] this decision
[39:44] different we can spend our lives wishing
[39:47] we had never or we can simply accept the
[39:50] grace of God that all things work
[39:52] together not that all are good but all
[39:55] things work together for our good to
[39:58] where we can actually learn even as the
[40:01] Prophet would tell us in his life story
[40:03] and many other times he would trust that
[40:06] what he was sharing with us throughout
[40:08] all of his decisions and mistakes that
[40:11] he would speak of he said I'm trust that
[40:14] they would be stepping stones of God's
[40:16] grace for your walk and for your life
[40:19] and I believe that was something that as
[40:22] believers that we can look at that
[40:24] within you know one another's lives and
[40:27] lives around us for me personally when I
[40:29] can see something maybe there's
[40:32] something that I can see well maybe I
[40:34] wouldn't have made that decision I have
[40:35] made this decision we know it's always
[40:37] easy if I can say it like this some of
[40:39] you understand to set in the quarterback
[40:41] chair it's always easy to be the one
[40:43] sitting in the you know the lay-z-boy
[40:45] and stood out on the field you can
[40:47] always look at things and say well this
[40:49] person should have done that and they
[40:50] should have done this but you know
[40:52] within the midst of it what we want to
[40:54] see is that when God allows us to see
[40:57] different things say Lord just help me
[40:59] to stay sensitive help me to stay healed
[41:02] it to you that decisions that I have
[41:04] coming up I'm just as much mortal as the
[41:07] other person is mortal I need your
[41:09] leadership Lord help me not to rest upon
[41:12] my own self or my own knowledge or
[41:15] seeing this but things that you show me
[41:17] are to pray about and that I might give
[41:19] myself even more to you we find that
[41:23] within this journey that's there's what
[41:25] God is showing within Israel you know
[41:28] Israel's just come out of the the Red
[41:30] Sea and brother Branham would
[41:32] give that of the Red Sea as a shadow of
[41:34] Pentecost where every one of their
[41:37] enemies were were destroyed behind them
[41:41] and washed upon the the sea shores
[41:43] brother Branham would also give that
[41:45] example of the Red Sea and tie that in
[41:48] to the Book of Revelations of where we
[41:50] will stand on the sea of glass and we
[41:52] will sing the song of victory he would
[41:55] tie that in and and speak of how that
[41:58] also that the enemy was after them to
[42:00] destroy them and speak of how that that
[42:03] is the enemy coming even after our
[42:05] physical health after our body but he
[42:08] said noticed child that God intervened
[42:11] when the enemy would have taken us and
[42:13] destroyed us after God bringing us out
[42:16] but God stepped in and I believe that we
[42:19] can understand that not only has God
[42:21] stepped into our lives before he ever
[42:24] took a hold of our lives but even after
[42:27] God's taken a hold of our life it is his
[42:30] hand upon our lives his brother Bannon
[42:32] would put it so clearly he said Oh God
[42:34] don't ever take your hand from off on my
[42:36] life
[42:37] he said because once that hand is taken
[42:39] from off my life he said the enemy will
[42:41] take my life so we want God's hand upon
[42:45] our life and you know and having God's
[42:47] hand upon our life it works within the
[42:49] scripture that his hand is his word is
[42:52] his power is his authority is his life
[42:55] it's his presence his word and then it
[42:58] calls to you and I that we would humble
[43:00] ourselves under the mighty hand of God
[43:02] and say lord I need you each and every
[43:06] moment within my life
[43:08] we find that as we were looking at here
[43:11] some weeks ago of how that in the midst
[43:14] of this time when they came to this
[43:16] situation of waters of Marah and we all
[43:19] have been there or are there or will be
[43:22] there it's part of the journey this is
[43:24] not punitive but it is God actually
[43:28] teaching us as his children that
[43:31] situations will arise within this life
[43:34] but yet I am always the ever-present God
[43:38] and God wanted this to be a statue it
[43:41] you see there's experiences in our life
[43:43] that don't ever just take the expense
[43:45] and just toss it over your shoulder it's
[43:47] an experience and that experience you
[43:50] might share it with somebody else and it
[43:52] may not have the same meaning to someone
[43:54] else but what's important is is that it
[43:57] is an experience that has meaning to
[43:59] your life and this is what God lets
[44:02] Israel know this is a statute and an
[44:04] ordinance that God would teach them
[44:06] there that in that if you will remain
[44:08] faithful to my voice if you'll follow my
[44:12] word then I will not put any of the
[44:14] diseases of Egypt upon you God you
[44:17] didn't say that we had to understand it
[44:19] but if you'll follow it if you let your
[44:21] heart be open to it you realize that
[44:23] many of the diseases that are upon the
[44:26] world today even when we look at that of
[44:28] the flu you realize the flu is a plague
[44:31] that was poured out upon England when
[44:33] England rejected the gospel visitation
[44:36] that was porn that was coming to them
[44:38] they rejected it and there was a vial
[44:40] that was poured out of influenza and yet
[44:43] we find within our lives that we
[44:45] experience you know influenza but yet he
[44:48] God made a promise when sickness comes
[44:51] your way I'm the Lord that healeth all
[44:53] thy diseases he shows that he is God and
[44:57] that there is the promise as Psalms 91
[45:00] that no plague shall come nigh thy
[45:03] dwelling when any sickness comes your
[45:06] way God's letting us know you don't be
[45:09] afraid of sickness even as he would
[45:11] remind us in this generation of the
[45:13] cancer age he would speak to us through
[45:16] through His Prophet and will remind you
[45:18] and I don't ever fear cancer why because
[45:22] there's one on the scene that's greater
[45:24] than cancer
[45:25] amen there's one on the scene here to
[45:28] deliver us from behold and all of that
[45:31] demonic oppression and those diseases
[45:34] from that demonic realm that would come
[45:36] in we realize sickness sickness itself
[45:39] is demons that that comes in to attack
[45:43] our bodies and and so here God would
[45:46] take them to let them know by an
[45:49] experience and this direction that Moses
[45:52] is given is to look upon the
[45:55] a little tree that is there and brother
[45:58] branham would would called this little
[46:00] tree and say you know that little tree
[46:02] said was a hyssop Bush and he said you
[46:05] know the hyssop you can never separate
[46:08] that it's always to be together
[46:12] brother band goes in to tell us in that
[46:14] place he said people can separate the
[46:16] cross and say the crosses for this and
[46:18] the crosses for that he said but you
[46:20] can't separate Christ you you can't you
[46:23] can even though the world you know has
[46:25] wanted to make Christ and how different
[46:28] meaning they wanted to take the name of
[46:31] Jesus Christ without the living reality
[46:33] of the deity of his name but you see
[46:36] there is a people of God chosen of God
[46:39] ordained of God that they within their
[46:42] hearts and life had a longing for that
[46:44] deity of Jesus Christ to be displayed in
[46:47] their life because it's the only thing
[46:49] that could ever bring victory in our
[46:51] life we were born defeated we were born
[46:54] without a chance as a matter of fact the
[46:56] life that we were in and even that we
[46:58] had steal walk among this life is
[47:01] nothing more than the Prophet would say
[47:03] has like a burning rubbish dump but yet
[47:06] when life has come into our lives that's
[47:09] what is real life we realized that all
[47:12] the rest of that really wasn't life at
[47:14] all but it comes the manifestation that
[47:17] as Jesus said I'm come that you might
[47:19] have life and that you might have it
[47:21] beyond imagine a man and so when we see
[47:25] it here this hyssop Bush was to be taken
[47:28] not just a part of it but to take the
[47:30] whole hyssop bush to cut it down and to
[47:33] put it in that water and when they put
[47:35] it in that water then through the hyssop
[47:38] route it actually brought us sweetening
[47:40] there to that water showing that in
[47:43] every situation that we go through that
[47:46] Christ himself he is the sweetening to
[47:49] every situation in our life you know was
[47:52] also attacked because everything within
[47:54] the scripture there's compound meanings
[47:56] with it all in this scripture it also
[47:59] goes to express remember in the
[48:01] scripture God would step forward and he
[48:03] would begin to reveal one of his seven
[48:06] compound redemptive names and he would
[48:08] reveal
[48:09] himself to Abraham that I am Jehovah
[48:12] Jireh the Lord provided you see God
[48:15] revealed himself not just to be
[48:17] revealing himself brother Ram said God
[48:19] does not just he'll to show his power
[48:21] but God comes and what he comes to do he
[48:24] does with the purpose because it is
[48:26] intended for the children of God to
[48:29] recognize what it's all about to think
[48:32] about it many around the prophets
[48:34] meeting many received healing they would
[48:36] come across the platform but did they
[48:38] really receive the depth of healing and
[48:40] to understand the purpose of what God
[48:43] was doing in this generation many did
[48:45] not know we understand some is
[48:48] dispensational but yet to understand the
[48:50] grace of God that no you and I and I
[48:53] believe I can say it there's not one of
[48:54] us that was there within those meetings
[48:57] but yet the revelation of Jesus Christ
[48:59] has struck our heart and there is a
[49:02] greater healing that has taken place
[49:03] within our life amen and we recognize
[49:07] what God has done within this generation
[49:10] that it was with you and I in mind and
[49:13] the scriptures that God promised our
[49:15] names are written within there that
[49:17] characteristic of Jesus Christ to be
[49:20] revealed in this hour our hearts were
[49:22] tied to that promise
[49:24] that's why churches could never satisfy
[49:27] the longing within our heart that's why
[49:30] even knowing theology of the message
[49:32] could never satisfy our heart but there
[49:34] was a longing and a craving for the very
[49:37] person of Jesus Christ and he knew you
[49:40] had have that craving he knew you would
[49:42] have that longing and he Jehovah Jireh
[49:45] provided for himself what you and I
[49:48] would have meat of and so we find that
[49:52] every experience God will reveal the
[49:55] attributes of his name and Animas we're
[49:58] looking at that hissa bush' cannot be
[50:00] separated it goes to say that you know
[50:04] if he is Jehovah Jireh he is our Savior
[50:08] then he is also Jehovah Rapha our healer
[50:12] he is also java sitka new he is also
[50:16] Jehovah Shalom he is all of the seven
[50:20] compound redemptive name
[50:22] and he will reveal himself to you and me
[50:26] as we have need of it there's plans in
[50:28] our life we need that revelation of
[50:31] jehova sholom to strike our hearts when
[50:34] situations have a rose that is trying
[50:37] our faith and and we're being oppressed
[50:40] by situations and accusations
[50:43] we need that revelation of jehova sholom
[50:46] for that moment there's times and
[50:48] sickness arises and we need the
[50:51] revelation of Jehovah Rapha for that
[50:54] moment he might have revealed himself
[50:56] before as you're over alpha but we know
[50:59] in that moment that's when we need for
[51:02] that revelation to strike our heart and
[51:04] you know what God never gets time of
[51:07] revealing himself and his children never
[51:10] give time of him revealing himself as he
[51:13] makes himself known and the same
[51:15] yesterday today and forever amen
[51:19] you can't separate him to the believer
[51:22] he's inseparable a man he's our Savior
[51:25] he's aren't healer he's our
[51:27] righteousness he's our deliverer he is
[51:30] our all in all and we apply that to
[51:33] every situation no matter how the
[51:36] bitterness would arise he is the same
[51:39] yesterday today and forever now you
[51:43] realize that there's no way that when we
[51:45] look at you know the Ministry of the
[51:49] word that there can ever be just a
[51:53] ministering on the soul without
[51:56] including divine healing because they go
[51:59] there girl each go together if you think
[52:02] back to Genesis chapter 2 verse 15
[52:05] remember when God in the beginning when
[52:07] he told his children he said that you're
[52:11] not to eat of the tree of the knowledge
[52:13] of good and evil for the day you eat
[52:15] thereof that day you surely die we
[52:18] recognized that when when Eve when the
[52:20] fall had come look at this the fall came
[52:23] by her entertaining a word that was
[52:26] contrary to the Word of God how long did
[52:30] it go on
[52:31] perhaps days on in maybe weeks on
[52:34] in that he or she received visitation
[52:37] after visitation but when she stopped to
[52:40] reason that's when death set in and
[52:43] words she received a word that was
[52:46] against God's Word now God gave them
[52:49] that word and he never asked them to
[52:51] explain how it's going to be he never
[52:54] asked him how to figure out how that
[52:56] you're gonna multiply and replenish the
[52:58] earth but you see God gave them the same
[53:01] basis that he has brought you and I on
[53:04] here tonight and that is to believe his
[53:07] word without explanation faith does not
[53:12] look for an explanation by faith itself
[53:17] is a divine revelation of God's will
[53:20] faith gives sight where these eyes will
[53:23] say and let reasoning enter I don't know
[53:26] how it could be but faith looks beyond
[53:29] what the doctor says faith looks beyond
[53:32] what reasoning said that's why faith it
[53:35] is necessary that we walk by faith and
[53:38] not by sight and there's only one way
[53:41] that we can really walk by faith and
[53:43] that's to receive the anointing of the
[53:45] word upon our life for this generation a
[53:48] man that reveals what God's program and
[53:52] what God's will is for our life and so
[53:55] there's no way you know when you think
[53:58] of how that a word would come that would
[54:01] lead God's daughter away from that
[54:04] perfect love and perfect understanding
[54:07] of the Word of God and you had say well
[54:09] how could it be a perfect understanding
[54:10] of the Word of God and yet they did not
[54:13] know how that multiplication was going
[54:16] to take place you realize a perfect
[54:18] understanding it's not that we know and
[54:21] then understand every little part about
[54:24] every little scripture but it's to know
[54:26] the god of the word and to know that
[54:29] that God of the word is the one that
[54:31] unfolds that word in that generation and
[54:34] in that season that word hope' glory
[54:37] that word leaves from just being a word
[54:40] it becomes a place of abode I think how
[54:44] brother Branham would say in God God's
[54:46] Word calls for a total separate
[54:48] he tells us in prayer he says Oh God let
[54:51] the people as they come across this
[54:53] platform tonight realize that they are
[54:56] approaching the temple of God what does
[54:59] he mean by approaching the temple of God
[55:01] it is where that a word that has been
[55:04] promised has now become unfolded as the
[55:07] person of Jesus Christ it has become a
[55:09] dwelling place so that the people of God
[55:12] can pass through that word and coming
[55:15] out on the other side they are made
[55:17] whole because the virtue of the Son of
[55:20] God is there in that word to release
[55:23] what is needed to that life I'm telling
[55:26] you this word it is not just letter the
[55:29] inspiration we've received it's not the
[55:32] inspiration a man the seals have been
[55:35] tore off and the inspiration from heaven
[55:38] and with the opening of the seventh seal
[55:40] has been poured down upon the book and
[55:43] we're not looking at this through the
[55:45] eyes of a man we are not looking at it
[55:48] through the eyes of a man but our eyes
[55:50] have been anointed by the Lord Jesus
[55:53] Christ I high priest himself is present
[55:57] with us hallelujah that's why they call
[56:03] us our bones that's why that they can
[56:07] understand brother been said why we
[56:10] don't yo cup with them he said but what
[56:13] it is there is a power and a vision
[56:16] behind this message amen it is sent from
[56:19] God to get a people ready and in order
[56:23] for rapture there's no way you and I
[56:26] could put ourselves in order though
[56:28] having the Bible but God here by divine
[56:31] inspiration inspiration comes on the
[56:34] music sheet and it begins to bring the
[56:36] symphony in harmony with a program of
[56:40] God because things were out of beat
[56:42] things were out of step and God had to
[56:44] bring us back in step and back in
[56:46] harmony with himself what did that the
[56:49] mercy of Almighty God it's the mercy of
[56:53] God a man
[56:55] the Lord that is promise and made real
[56:58] to you and I I am the Lord that healeth
[57:01] thee amen you know we could go from
[57:05] church to church and from situation to
[57:08] situation but you realize but a church
[57:11] could never heal us religion can never
[57:15] bring healing but there had to be one
[57:18] come that could bring that healing that
[57:21] we needed hallelujah when elijah came on
[57:26] the scene he came to deal with the
[57:28] source you find that how that every time
[57:31] when you look even in the Book of
[57:32] Jeremiah and throughout you know in the
[57:34] Book of Isaiah you read about healing
[57:37] it'll speak of how that when the
[57:39] children of Israel they would you know
[57:41] go their own way they would begin to
[57:43] forsake the things of God and they begin
[57:46] to you know they a sickness was entering
[57:50] in to their lives you say sickness yes
[57:53] remember sickness has a lot of symptoms
[57:55] there's a lot of symptoms you know even
[57:58] sometimes when you just to think about
[58:00] it if what the Lord has you know been
[58:02] moving upon my body with and removing
[58:05] that bronchitis from my body I'll begin
[58:07] to think back and I thought not you know
[58:09] perhaps you know even weeks and in the
[58:11] middle of December some of that was
[58:13] working you know on my body there and a
[58:15] cough that it started you know I didn't
[58:18] know but little things begin to work and
[58:20] you know that's how a sickness is it can
[58:23] work little by little there are symptoms
[58:26] and it's important that we read iagnosed
[58:29] the symptoms by the Word of God amen you
[58:34] know when we look at this here Elijah is
[58:37] you know in the midst of I have a
[58:39] situation and I I think of this word
[58:42] that we read in the scriptures tonight
[58:44] of the very last word there in Exodus 15
[58:47] 16 for I'm the Lord that healeth II this
[58:51] is the first time that God would make
[58:53] known himself that I am Jehovah Rapha he
[58:57] wouldn't make known that I am the healer
[58:59] what was it it brought it about and
[59:01] experienced there was a need well there
[59:04] was a need that was within Israel when
[59:06] Israel had began to forsake
[59:09] jehovah and they begin to go after other
[59:11] gods they begin to go after other
[59:14] remedies and trying to find other needs
[59:16] within their life but god had a man on
[59:19] the scene by the name of elijah
[59:21] they have hated him he didn't want
[59:23] nothing to do with him but remember God
[59:25] by His Word had revealed to Elijah call
[59:29] him to a Mount Carmel showdown and
[59:30] Elijah comes to this place he allows
[59:33] them you know to build their altars and
[59:35] how they build them in you know they ran
[59:38] around the altar and they were my had a
[59:40] great emotional time but there was no
[59:43] answer no answer of fire a mountain but
[59:48] they the the the the the the choice or
[59:51] or the challenge was put forth but the
[59:54] Bible tells us here I love this in first
[59:57] grade first Kings 1830 then Elisha said
[1:00:00] unto all the people come near unto me
[1:00:04] and all the people came near unto him
[1:00:07] and he repaired the word repaired is
[1:00:10] Rafa he ruffled he repaired the altar of
[1:00:15] the Lord that was broken down we saw
[1:00:18] Elijah's ministry was a ministry that
[1:00:21] would come with healing in it where
[1:00:24] Israel had been broken you see what the
[1:00:27] altar the altar was representative of
[1:00:30] the brokenness of the fellowship between
[1:00:33] them and God the only way to repair that
[1:00:37] fellowship was get back to the altar of
[1:00:39] God get back to the original sacrifice
[1:00:42] get back to the true atonement get back
[1:00:45] to that to wear a life that is lived to
[1:00:48] please the Lord and him alone and so he
[1:00:51] repaired not another altar but he
[1:00:53] repaired the altar of the Lord
[1:00:55] Elijah stood there on Mount Carmel he
[1:00:58] took the loose ends that were scattered
[1:01:00] and he brought those loose ends to show
[1:01:02] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:01:05] today and forever it was a pattern for
[1:01:08] any life that is broken when that life
[1:01:11] will come in harmony with God's Word
[1:01:13] cannot build that life stone on top of
[1:01:16] stone and when God is building that
[1:01:19] light stone on top of stone no matter
[1:01:21] how broken it is the brokenness didn't
[1:01:24] take the stones away but the God who is
[1:01:27] there can restore Jehovah rif and bring
[1:01:30] together what is broken he can bring it
[1:01:33] back together that his glory might
[1:01:36] return it fall upon your life afresh he
[1:01:40] is the Lord that he loved thee he's
[1:01:46] going to the source and Elijah makes the
[1:01:49] prayer let it be known that I'm your
[1:01:51] servant
[1:01:53] Elijah wasn't asking that that before
[1:01:57] self-glorification
[1:01:59] he's letting it be known let it be known
[1:02:02] that I'm your servant one who has your
[1:02:06] word why because God directs his
[1:02:10] children by his word we find out the
[1:02:14] fire fell God came and answered God
[1:02:18] answered by fire and by answering by
[1:02:20] fire the veil was taken off their hearts
[1:02:22] or their hearts were turned unto the
[1:02:25] Lord God God is faithful think about the
[1:02:30] you know if I can skip ahead just to
[1:02:34] look at it Elijah as well here's a
[1:02:36] situation in the Bible in second Kings
[1:02:38] 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 19 there's a
[1:02:42] situation in a city that's very bad it's
[1:02:47] a situation the Bible would say that the
[1:02:50] situation I want you to look at this in
[1:02:52] verse 19 this situation of this city is
[1:02:55] pleasant it looks very the city it looks
[1:02:59] very becoming more pleasant but there is
[1:03:03] a need that these men of the city
[1:03:06] recognize you can see it's pleasant but
[1:03:09] the water is not and the ground is
[1:03:13] bearing and and I just said bring me a
[1:03:16] new cruise and put salt there and how
[1:03:19] many knows its salt is used for that of
[1:03:22] the Covenant salt is to call forth the
[1:03:26] Covenant it's to seal that covenant away
[1:03:29] and here the salt he calls for a new
[1:03:33] crew not a crew that's
[1:03:34] used before but we want a new cruise
[1:03:39] amen God will send an old message God
[1:03:42] sends a fresh message amen God sends a
[1:03:46] fresh message from the throne of God is
[1:03:50] that right
[1:03:51] amen and that fresh message that God
[1:03:54] even has sent to us in this generation
[1:03:57] it was not somewhat of an old message
[1:04:00] repackaged but it is restoring us back
[1:04:04] to the faith of the Apostolic fathers
[1:04:08] restoring us back to that same power
[1:04:10] that same Authority that same word that
[1:04:13] same revelation that was preached by the
[1:04:17] early church that unfolding of election
[1:04:20] and on and on that we could go and hear
[1:04:23] a new crus the promise is when the enemy
[1:04:25] would come in like a flood that the
[1:04:27] Spirit of God would raise a standard up
[1:04:30] against the enemy bring me a new cruise
[1:04:32] and put salt in there not old
[1:04:35] theological ideas you see that's why the
[1:04:38] admonition from the Holy Ghost through
[1:04:40] the prophet in the message rapture would
[1:04:42] say you cannot bring that old leaven
[1:04:44] over here and try to mix it with this
[1:04:46] message you've got to burn it with fire
[1:04:49] I don't care how good the old ideas seem
[1:04:52] those all ideas cannot be mixed with
[1:04:55] this it has got to be that fresh manna
[1:04:59] fresh revelation that's why this message
[1:05:02] it is the fresh inspiration from the
[1:05:06] throne of God that has come upon the
[1:05:08] Word of God amen it's to bring life to
[1:05:12] our lives amen that's what it's become
[1:05:15] its life to you and I and they brought
[1:05:18] it to him and he went forth the Bible
[1:05:21] says in verse 21 he went forth unto the
[1:05:24] spring of the waters and he cast the
[1:05:27] salt in there and he said thus saith the
[1:05:30] Lord I've healed these waters and there
[1:05:32] shall not be from fence any more death
[1:05:35] or barren land so the waters were healed
[1:05:39] unto this day according to the saying of
[1:05:43] Elijah which he spake notice they let
[1:05:47] him
[1:05:47] oh the city it looks good it looks good
[1:05:51] but it's barren the water is the problem
[1:05:54] in Liza
[1:05:55] so Ashley calls for that new cruise and
[1:05:58] one fill it was salt but it lets them
[1:06:02] know we're not just going to deal with
[1:06:03] the problems we're seeing right now you
[1:06:06] take me to the source of the problem
[1:06:08] take me to the spring of the problem yet
[1:06:11] you see remember it was here the crus of
[1:06:14] salt but remember the crus of salt was
[1:06:17] only a symbol that represented of what
[1:06:20] God was doing back his word for Alaska
[1:06:24] said that's safer Lord these waters
[1:06:26] shall be healed
[1:06:27] that cruces alt was only a symbol of the
[1:06:30] of the effect of the word striking those
[1:06:33] waters let me tell you something waters
[1:06:36] it can symbolize the Spirit of God and
[1:06:38] yet waters themselves symbolize the
[1:06:41] thickness and multitudes of people you
[1:06:44] and I were in this generation here we
[1:06:47] were among the thickness and multitudes
[1:06:49] of people Amen there is that spirit of
[1:06:52] the great that was setting upon
[1:06:54] the fitness and multitudes of people
[1:06:56] that religion sending up over our lives
[1:06:59] I'm talking about the devil's religion
[1:07:01] where he says you can be a good
[1:07:03] Christian all you gotta do is confess
[1:07:05] Jesus as your Savior you just gotta go
[1:07:08] to church you don't matter how you live
[1:07:10] what is it it's a power that's trying to
[1:07:12] keep the people under bondage but God in
[1:07:15] this generation he has poured himself
[1:07:18] out upon the waters and there is a
[1:07:21] people who have within them the seed of
[1:07:23] Almighty God that received that touch in
[1:07:27] the very source of their soul we are no
[1:07:30] longer a parent people without fruit but
[1:07:34] life has come to us
[1:07:36] it is the life of God's Word I am the
[1:07:39] lord that heal Assyria
[1:07:41] Amen Jehovah Rapha to our lives
[1:07:44] he has been poured out upon our lives
[1:07:49] both I can only stop this let him pour
[1:07:53] out upon the source of your life you'll
[1:07:56] never be able to stop Bilson if I can
[1:07:59] quit this and I can quit
[1:08:00] but you said Lord pour in the salt into
[1:08:04] my life Lord let the word go to the lead
[1:08:08] me to the spring of these waters I don't
[1:08:12] you understand what I'm saying
[1:08:14] it's not just about I want rid of this
[1:08:16] habit or I want rid of this no it gotta
[1:08:19] go deeper take me to the spring of those
[1:08:23] waters and the word reaches its mark in
[1:08:27] our life it changes our life from a life
[1:08:30] of bitterness it changes it to the
[1:08:33] sweetness by the presence of Almighty
[1:08:36] God that's the effect of the word of the
[1:08:39] Lord in our lives hallelujah Oh glory be
[1:08:46] to God to think of God's unfailing mercy
[1:08:50] divine healing here was present and the
[1:08:54] Lord was showing here even to Israel he
[1:08:58] was showing that the healing of the body
[1:09:01] they would receive healing of the body
[1:09:03] and that healing of the body right in
[1:09:06] the Old Testament healing was always
[1:09:09] apart and he told him I'm the Lord that
[1:09:12] healeth thee this healing of the body
[1:09:15] was only a witness think about it when
[1:09:19] nothing could turn around in the body
[1:09:21] you might just think about a common cold
[1:09:23] and you might just think well my
[1:09:25] headache ER or this you know it's just
[1:09:27] going to get better you know that's
[1:09:28] faith but do you realize that it is the
[1:09:33] Lord that moves on our behalf I have
[1:09:38] often wondered that even the atheists
[1:09:40] and the infidel their own body is a
[1:09:42] testimony against them you can put
[1:09:46] penicillin on a cut if a man is dead
[1:09:48] that penicillin will never heal that cut
[1:09:51] why because life is the healer life must
[1:09:56] be present in that body is that right
[1:09:59] you could baptize them in penicillin
[1:10:01] it'll never turn him around but that
[1:10:04] healing of the body was only God's
[1:10:06] showing I'm gonna bring a healing to the
[1:10:08] soul
[1:10:09] and when I bring a healing to the soul
[1:10:12] that healing of the soul will lead to
[1:10:15] the healing of the body a man which will
[1:10:18] lead to the redemption of the body Oh
[1:10:20] Matt don't you love the Lord oh my this
[1:10:25] is what David would say familiar
[1:10:27] scripture in Psalms 103 oh my just in
[1:10:31] prayer this afternoon and it just struck
[1:10:33] me just as I was praying and the
[1:10:35] scripture come across my heart where
[1:10:37] David said bless the Lord O my soul and
[1:10:41] all that is within me bless His Holy
[1:10:43] Name how many of you know that soul is
[1:10:45] the real gift of God here taken the
[1:10:51] quickening power of God even though that
[1:10:53] soul is the real gift of God but you and
[1:10:56] I could not bring ourselves into birth
[1:11:00] but it took Almighty God to bring his
[1:11:04] children in to birth that seed was lack
[1:11:07] of the egg but his life coming into that
[1:11:10] seed is a quickening power it brings
[1:11:13] forth a son and daughter of God it is
[1:11:16] that it's only sons and daughters of God
[1:11:18] or only bread backed by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:21] coming through the word it brings about
[1:11:24] a new creation and a change in the life
[1:11:27] we were sitting that's why man drinks
[1:11:29] that's why man loves that's why man goes
[1:11:32] after all those other things or whomever
[1:11:34] it's because they're sick they need a
[1:11:37] remedy they need a remedy they might go
[1:11:41] for a little bit and well I'm doing
[1:11:42] pretty good now and I'm doing pretty
[1:11:44] good that that's all wonderful but to
[1:11:46] realize for your soul you don't have to
[1:11:49] live in a temporary victory you can have
[1:11:52] a victory that lasts 24 hours a day
[1:11:57] seven days a week you can live in the
[1:12:01] holiest of holy in the innermost place
[1:12:04] Amen where your life bears the fruit of
[1:12:08] Jesus Christ that is prophesied within
[1:12:11] this hour your I cannot bear that fruit
[1:12:14] but in his presence what is
[1:12:18] US comes out he brings it out whoa
[1:12:27] hallelujah bless the Lord all my soul
[1:12:31] and all that is within me bless His Holy
[1:12:36] Name bless the Lord O my soul
[1:12:39] David ain't repeating he ain't stirring
[1:12:42] he's making a statement here bless the
[1:12:45] Lord O my soul brother send your mock
[1:12:48] body don't feel like it he didn't say
[1:12:51] bless the Lord my body
[1:12:52] he said bless the Lord O my soul him I
[1:12:58] let the soul step up and say body shut
[1:13:01] up you are here for me not me for you
[1:13:08] you might receive benefits where you get
[1:13:11] weak and by the grace of God healing is
[1:13:14] brought to your life come on now bless
[1:13:19] the Lord O my soul and forget not all
[1:13:22] his benefits and it wonderful to
[1:13:26] remember his benefits hallelujah you
[1:13:31] might say I know that he is a healer
[1:13:33] gets sick again and then it comes to you
[1:13:35] you don't forget his benefits you look
[1:13:39] at that situation and say lord I need a
[1:13:41] brand new touch hallelujah God are
[1:13:49] unfolding a testimony after testimony
[1:13:50] verse 3 who forgiveth notice how the
[1:13:54] Lord brings us together who forgiveth
[1:13:56] all thine iniquities who healeth all thy
[1:14:01] diseases I'll just make it very simple I
[1:14:05] think of how FF boswer took this
[1:14:07] scripture brother Branham coming you
[1:14:09] know right around but if they're
[1:14:10] buzzwords were to take this and
[1:14:11] challenge people when when the healing
[1:14:13] was was being ministered he said if you
[1:14:16] can find that there is someone iniquity
[1:14:19] that he has not taken then there could
[1:14:21] be a sickness that he has not atone for
[1:14:23] but if he
[1:14:25] sealed and delivered you of all
[1:14:27] iniquities and that's the promise of his
[1:14:29] word then it also stands that he's the
[1:14:31] Lord that he lets all line diseases you
[1:14:35] can't have one without the other
[1:14:40] hallelujah Oh bless the Lord O my soul
[1:14:47] whoo if my feet could only match how my
[1:14:50] soul feels right now hallelujah third
[1:14:57] John chapter 1 verse 2 they love it look
[1:15:00] at this this is not just John this is
[1:15:03] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:05] moving through John
[1:15:07] beloved I wish above all things that
[1:15:09] thou mayest prosper and be in health not
[1:15:13] just that you might be healed but being
[1:15:14] health brother man will come right
[1:15:17] around and say he said Satan is after
[1:15:20] your health he said that God desires you
[1:15:22] would be in health not just be healed
[1:15:24] but being health that thou mayest
[1:15:28] prosper and be in health even as to what
[1:15:32] extent even as that soul prospereth
[1:15:37] glory be to God
[1:15:39] brother Brownwood sent like this and the
[1:15:41] sudden secret going away of the church
[1:15:43] you said it's better to be ready I'd
[1:15:46] rather be a sick man ready with the Lord
[1:15:48] than to be a well man not ready to go
[1:15:51] with the Lord but however it be God is
[1:15:55] so willing that we be both well and
[1:15:57] ready soul and body for he forgives all
[1:16:01] of our iniquities and heals all our
[1:16:04] diseases he died for a compound purpose
[1:16:09] 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 24 who his own
[1:16:13] self bare our sins in his own body on
[1:16:16] the tree that we being dead to sins
[1:16:20] should live unto righteousness by whose
[1:16:23] stripes you were healed but we were as
[1:16:28] sheep going astray but are now returned
[1:16:30] under the Shepherd and Bishop of our
[1:16:33] souls
[1:16:34] brother Brown would go to say said if
[1:16:36] God delivered you from sin how much more
[1:16:40] will he deliver you from sickness you
[1:16:42] see look reasoning is not bad when it's
[1:16:45] with God's Word as they are said by the
[1:16:48] Spirit of God come let us reason
[1:16:49] together here he is remember look Jesus
[1:16:53] he would he would call try to stir up
[1:16:55] the reasoning of the Pharisees remember
[1:16:58] reasoning is the gate of judgment right
[1:17:01] God never took away those gates in our
[1:17:03] life but like Nehemiah he restored them
[1:17:06] to their rightful position and working
[1:17:08] that's sure to keep certain things at
[1:17:10] bay right bars doors locks upon every
[1:17:14] gate except the Sheep gate you're to
[1:17:16] always let Jesus in are you with me
[1:17:19] he's always been a should always be
[1:17:22] freely to come in and move in our lives
[1:17:24] is that right well I don't have time for
[1:17:27] that but you understand think you may
[1:17:29] understand that very clearly in our
[1:17:31] lives of how better that that would be
[1:17:34] God had delivered us from sin to think
[1:17:36] about it the same God that delivered
[1:17:38] from the hole of sin and from where our
[1:17:40] hearts desire and beat out to be
[1:17:43] pleasing unto the Lord sin has lost its
[1:17:46] hold let me tell you if you can take
[1:17:49] that witness you know brother just
[1:17:50] wearing somebody else's testimony that's
[1:17:52] your testimony that you can stand on the
[1:17:55] word and say the same God that delivered
[1:17:58] me from sin is the same God to deliver
[1:18:01] me from sickness you see you've got the
[1:18:04] word of the Lord present in your hand Oh
[1:18:09] glorious almost forgot him sick he's
[1:18:15] able to take oh my he's able to take and
[1:18:19] change your nature and make you a new
[1:18:21] person why would you fear about any
[1:18:23] sickness if he can save your soul and
[1:18:26] change your nature change your motives
[1:18:29] change your ideas how much more can he
[1:18:33] change your sickness into hell and put
[1:18:36] it back in its right place again where
[1:18:39] it belongs
[1:18:43] holder and over how glod right here we
[1:18:45] don't have to go outside of this
[1:18:46] assembly where God has manifested divine
[1:18:50] healing right here and we don't have to
[1:18:54] go way back in history either there said
[1:18:56] sister Rita states for cancer completely
[1:19:01] healed who did that and the Lord that he
[1:19:06] loved thee the many other testimonies
[1:19:15] that could be gone through it Scott you
[1:19:18] know what it is it's God letting you and
[1:19:20] I know my presence has not departed I'm
[1:19:23] still the cloud of my word let me put it
[1:19:29] to you just a simple brother mom said he
[1:19:31] has to recognize the presence of God he
[1:19:34] said you can receive your healing in a
[1:19:36] cornfield just as much as you can in a
[1:19:39] church you recognize what this message
[1:19:42] came for you and I and the presence of
[1:19:44] God
[1:19:45] that's what Paul said when I'm gone and
[1:19:47] the services commenced that your faith
[1:19:49] would not rest in the enticing words of
[1:19:52] man's wisdom but would rest in your
[1:19:54] faith would rest in the power of God
[1:19:57] that when Satan would rear his ugly head
[1:19:59] you might be in your kitchen you might
[1:20:02] be in a hospital you might be in a
[1:20:04] Walmart or wherever it's at but when it
[1:20:07] can rear its head you've got a promise
[1:20:09] of a living God I'm the Lord that
[1:20:12] healeth thee and that flutter ation was
[1:20:18] to start I'm the Lord that he loved thee
[1:20:22] hallelujah glory be to God the same
[1:20:26] goddess Jehovah Jireh is Jehovah Rapha
[1:20:29] he's Jehovah Cheryl glory hallelujah oh
[1:20:37] my and to think of it how brother
[1:20:40] Branagh would bring it around and God of
[1:20:42] this evil age I love this he says I'm
[1:20:44] pray I pray Lord that she would heal
[1:20:47] them Lord but for the greatest of all
[1:20:51] healing
[1:20:52] if you heal their physical body from
[1:20:56] cancer I want you to listen this state
[1:21:00] now I know we know this if you heal
[1:21:02] their physical body from cancer TB and
[1:21:06] pneumonia something they'll get sick
[1:21:10] again no doubt how many times are living
[1:21:14] just pause here don't keep ringing on
[1:21:15] how many times we've seen people be
[1:21:18] healed and they want God to heal them
[1:21:23] but they don't want to surrender their
[1:21:24] life you know what I'm tired of going
[1:21:28] through life this way he don't work that
[1:21:31] way I've heard but now I see the Prophet
[1:21:35] ties it back into motive and objective
[1:21:37] he said you want God to heal you why do
[1:21:39] you want God to heal you why do you want
[1:21:43] he said so that you can go on and live
[1:21:45] the same life you've always left
[1:21:49] this cut things aren't it calls us to
[1:21:51] think sometimes we can be so interested
[1:21:55] in lifting a sickness that actually it
[1:21:58] would cause a person you might say
[1:22:00] they've been going like this for years
[1:22:01] but it might come to a family down to a
[1:22:04] place that they recognize there's a
[1:22:06] greater sickness that's in their soul
[1:22:08] that they need healed off I don't want
[1:22:16] to see nobody sick I'll be honest with
[1:22:17] you I don't I don't like sickness I'm
[1:22:21] not just talking about for myself I
[1:22:22] don't like seeing other people sick and
[1:22:25] that's just the truth
[1:22:26] how do lack seein people sick I thank
[1:22:29] God like brother BAM would say thank God
[1:22:31] for every doctor from all the surgeons
[1:22:33] from all the medicines there it's just
[1:22:35] God's gift to the people thank God for
[1:22:38] all of that but to think of this here
[1:22:41] that can be healed of cancer TB
[1:22:43] pneumonia but they'll get sick again if
[1:22:47] they live long enough for their body is
[1:22:50] still under sin the curse but you let
[1:22:53] them get the real divine healing the
[1:22:56] healing of the soul which makes a new
[1:22:59] creature it passes from death unto life
[1:23:01] and then waiting in this old Tabernacle
[1:23:06] somebody say this old Tabernacle yeah
[1:23:10] that's right
[1:23:11] you may not a'right reach the ripe old
[1:23:13] age of 25 and yours has weeping on back
[1:23:16] down to the dirt but you're still
[1:23:18] waiting in this old tabernacle for the
[1:23:20] redemption of the body after the soul
[1:23:23] has been redeemed the soul has been
[1:23:28] redeemed healing has come to the soul
[1:23:33] hallelujah and this old tabernacle
[1:23:36] experiences sickness
[1:23:41] this old tabernacle experiences wounds
[1:23:48] the Branham standing and the message
[1:23:51] standing in the gap he said I'd been cut
[1:23:53] so deep done many of my friends those
[1:23:57] were not wounds that you could put
[1:23:59] stitches on those were wounds inside of
[1:24:04] his spirit but he's still the Lord that
[1:24:10] healeth II he specializes in healings I
[1:24:16] said he's a wound care specialist he
[1:24:25] knows how to treat that wound get all
[1:24:27] the debris out of that wound he knows
[1:24:30] how to look at that and say nope we
[1:24:32] can't bandage it up right now no we
[1:24:34] can't cover that up because it'll canker
[1:24:37] it'll fester it it'll have an effect on
[1:24:40] your life
[1:24:41] we gotta clean all of that out but once
[1:24:44] he gets it all cleaned out then as
[1:24:46] Jehovah Rapha he can begin to pour in
[1:24:49] oil and wine he begins to pour in his
[1:24:53] word and his spirit and he binds up the
[1:24:57] brokenhearted all glory he takes a lot
[1:25:01] that is wounded that can say I could
[1:25:03] never entertain the thought I have been
[1:25:06] so long in my life but Jehovah right but
[1:25:10] could say I am the lord that he loved me
[1:25:13] he can take what looks like no way he
[1:25:18] can make away whether looks like no way
[1:25:22] he's Joe Bereta and beloved that he
[1:25:28] loved me nor would be the gardener was a
[1:25:37] man but the RAM would extract you know
[1:25:41] express this over and over and he would
[1:25:46] say that the basis of divine healing is
[1:25:49] not on the same level of salvation we
[1:25:51] know it requires faith for both but here
[1:25:55] was a man who was one desiring healing
[1:25:59] in his body and his body he wasn't
[1:26:04] getting better it was getting worse so
[1:26:07] was having understand understanding he'd
[1:26:10] begin to question he said well if I
[1:26:12] don't have faith for my healing and I
[1:26:15] don't see the healing coming but maybe I
[1:26:18] don't got enough faith for my salvation
[1:26:19] either brother branham cat catches him
[1:26:22] as he is saying this and he let's see he
[1:26:26] lets the man know he lets him know that
[1:26:29] once you've been born again of the
[1:26:31] Spirit of God
[1:26:33] you can never die a man is satisfied for
[1:26:39] eternity this body can get sick come on
[1:26:43] now you know I'm talking to you the
[1:26:45] devil can play right on your mind I
[1:26:47] don't care how many times that God has
[1:26:49] come along and heals you you need a
[1:26:51] fresh experience and a fresh touch from
[1:26:55] Jehovah a flower
[1:26:58] sometimes a sickness or whatever can
[1:27:01] linger and can go on and it goes longer
[1:27:04] than what any other sickness has gone
[1:27:06] before
[1:27:09] that isn't that you're some weakling in
[1:27:12] Christ let me tell you something I can't
[1:27:14] deal with it tonight but everybody has
[1:27:16] given a measure of faith is to stand
[1:27:19] upon that word and like the Holy Spirit
[1:27:21] brought in and interjected or late for
[1:27:23] us last week be patient therefore after
[1:27:26] we've done the will of God be patient
[1:27:29] and stand with it when anything arises
[1:27:31] contrary to that word you stand upon
[1:27:34] that word and said this is contrary to
[1:27:36] the Word of God that's why brother
[1:27:38] Graham says cite and symptoms is faiths
[1:27:40] worst enemy don't entertain the symptoms
[1:27:45] don't entertain the sights don't google
[1:27:48] them
[1:27:50] rebuked that devil you're gonna feel
[1:27:55] your heart with something you might as
[1:27:57] well fill it with a promise of God's
[1:28:00] Word
[1:28:02] that job said I will wait to my chains
[1:28:06] comes I will wait on the Lord they that
[1:28:11] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:28:13] strength they shall mount up with wings
[1:28:17] as an eagle they shall run and not be
[1:28:21] weary they shall walk and not faint
[1:28:25] teach me Lord teach me in order to wait
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:33] hallelujah
[1:28:34] this body brother Branham would put it
[1:28:38] like this in that statement he said this
[1:28:40] body it gets sick weak and God helps us
[1:28:44] in heals us and we get sick again it's
[1:28:49] just temporarily until the journey is
[1:28:52] finished but salvation is permanent
[1:28:56] forever this guy he gets well feels
[1:29:03] better man I feel better this Thursday
[1:29:04] night didn't last Thursday I literally
[1:29:09] didn't know how in the world that I was
[1:29:10] going to even do anything last Thursday
[1:29:12] I feel a lot better and day by day I'm
[1:29:16] getting better it feels good to feel
[1:29:21] good but it's temporary you can be
[1:29:28] healed of pneumonia tonight and next
[1:29:31] week died with pneumonia they don't have
[1:29:34] nothing to do with your soul your soul
[1:29:38] is not a temporary fix your soul is a
[1:29:43] permanent heal a
[1:29:48] you were sick I was sick but we got an
[1:29:51] inoculation I don't believe in
[1:29:56] immunizations I do I do
[1:30:00] there's a sin epidemic on the loose and
[1:30:04] the church don't believe in that
[1:30:06] inoculations or immunizations either oh
[1:30:09] that's all wives tales you don't need
[1:30:11] those immunizations we need the
[1:30:13] immunization of the Holy Ghost amen the
[1:30:17] Word of God coming to bring a divine
[1:30:20] inoculation that lifts us above the sin
[1:30:23] question hey man he don't do a temporary
[1:30:28] fix you find that man or he might be he
[1:30:30] might be within as far in his body and
[1:30:33] his mind sometimes he gets worried but
[1:30:36] that soul is dwelling in the Shekinah of
[1:30:39] God your body sometimes you say ma I
[1:30:42] can't give wait till I get back to work
[1:30:45] and you know go to church I'm feeling a
[1:30:47] little sick and you know I can't wait
[1:30:49] till I get bored where my mind and I can
[1:30:51] pray you know like I used to pray but
[1:30:53] you know that's only temporary but that
[1:30:55] soul once it has passed from death unto
[1:30:57] life there's no more going back Paul
[1:31:03] would call this of what weird welling in
[1:31:06] in Romans eight he would call it this
[1:31:09] bondage of corruption this corruption
[1:31:14] good as we try to do and everything else
[1:31:16] it keeps going downhill
[1:31:22] whenever hand a lot of amens on that one
[1:31:24] but it's a truth
[1:31:27] if bondage of corrupt notice bondage of
[1:31:30] corruption but your souls already been
[1:31:32] set free your soul has already been set
[1:31:36] free and soon and very soon we are going
[1:31:40] to receive a body that matches the work
[1:31:43] of the soul
[1:31:46] hallelujah glory be to God I feel like
[1:31:50] preaching right now but I can't go no
[1:31:51] more the whole creation is groaning and
[1:31:55] travailing not only are they groaning
[1:31:59] it's for their look at all these
[1:32:00] earthquakes earthquakes in divers places
[1:32:02] you know if the earth the earth is
[1:32:03] groaning you know the earth the world

[1:32:12] be changed come on she's already
[1:32:15] received her water baptism the black has
[1:32:18] come down upon it she's waiting for that
[1:32:20] fire baptism that other part of
[1:32:22] sanctification to we're set up on this
[1:32:25] earth in that of the millennium and then
[1:32:27] into the future home she's longing for
[1:32:30] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:32:33] glory be to God and the same thing as
[1:32:37] Paul said same thing with you and I
[1:32:38] that's received the earnest of the
[1:32:40] Spirit in our hearts there is a longing
[1:32:44] there's a longing why because there is
[1:32:48] the evidence there is a land beyond the
[1:32:53] river the evidence of the Holy Ghost the
[1:32:57] love of God has moved into our heart it
[1:33:00] is an evidence there is a land beyond
[1:33:04] the river and God permits you and I to
[1:33:08] get sick here and there in this
[1:33:10] situation to come up and this to rise
[1:33:12] why to declare to you and I that there
[1:33:15] is coming a redemption of the body when

[1:33:49] this body is still under sin the body is
[1:33:52] but our souls already been redeemed
[1:33:56] Satan can come and try to flex his
[1:33:59] muscles on our body but remember you
[1:34:03] can't do nothing to you first get
[1:34:04] permission from Daddy
[1:34:08] may we be like Joel but Jill wasn't Joel
[1:34:11] chapter 1 when the affliction came the
[1:34:14] Bible says Jobe worshiped the Lord and
[1:34:19] then he said the Lord helped me to
[1:34:20] worship let me tell you I just tried to
[1:34:24] stop there tonight let me tell you how
[1:34:26] powerful worship is my life was dealing
[1:34:31] with the situation one night we couldn't
[1:34:35] get that we couldn't get the pain to
[1:34:38] subside
[1:34:40] now you say brother Sammy you don't
[1:34:42] believe in gonna Hospital no I believe
[1:34:43] him in the hospital
[1:34:44] I believe if you got a headache take an
[1:34:45] aspirin and go take a look you ain't
[1:34:48] proven nothing to nobody I don't mean to
[1:34:50] go on now on that tangent but I'm just
[1:34:52] telling you ain't proven nothing to
[1:34:53] nobody
[1:34:53] we've been delivered over that tradition
[1:34:55] of man come on now that even under Pride
[1:34:59] and this is your pastor talking now it
[1:35:03] ain't nothing but pride you know brother
[1:35:05] branham got criticized by a woman dis
[1:35:07] man preaching divine healing he runs his
[1:35:09] kids to the doctor when they get sick
[1:35:12] duh and ain't the medicine that heals
[1:35:16] the kids God's the healer somehow her
[1:35:22] faith was shaken within that's God that
[1:35:24] healed if you read your Bible you'll
[1:35:26] also find that God spoke healing through
[1:35:28] the mouth of Isaiah and he said go put
[1:35:31] figs and you'll recover that boil it
[1:35:34] wasn't the figs it was the word of the
[1:35:35] Lord
[1:35:36] I love when you get the devil in the
[1:35:39] corner you just work him over like a
[1:35:41] male press not me but the Spirit of God
[1:35:44] cuz you know why it's rise to take
[1:35:46] Liberty from God's children that's what
[1:35:50] it is and that's why listen friends I've
[1:35:52] met many people then they can make a
[1:35:54] statement you know people say well my
[1:35:56] faith keeps sickness from me my faith C
[1:35:58] keep sickness from it you ain't got
[1:35:59] nothing no different than anybody else
[1:36:01] but when it comes down to when sickness
[1:36:03] comes your way is to recognize that you
[1:36:06] ain't failed God but it's to recognize
[1:36:08] God there is permission from God to
[1:36:11] afflict your body come on somebody a man
[1:36:17] but to think how worship let me get back
[1:36:19] to this point with worship how powerful
