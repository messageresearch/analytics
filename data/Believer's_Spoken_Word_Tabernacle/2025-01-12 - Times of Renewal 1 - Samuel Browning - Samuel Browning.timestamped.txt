[41:28] in Jesus name amen and
[41:32] amen amen if you turn with me
[41:37] to Joshua chapter
[41:53] 8 want to say God bless you it's so good
[41:56] to see
[41:58] each and every one of you and different
[41:59] ones
[42:00] that have made it have made it back here
[42:03] and I know it's a definite relief for
[42:05] you we've got uh from sickness and so
[42:09] forth but we thank God for his mercies
[42:11] aren't you thank God for his healing
[42:13] touch amen and amen we're just uh so
[42:17] thankful for the mercy of the Lord and
[42:21] um I know uh we just want to continue as
[42:25] you mentioned just to continue to keep
[42:26] um
[42:27] brother Richie and sister paty in your
[42:29] prayers and the family and uh there's a
[42:32] lot of things that I know that they
[42:34] they've already been dealing with and
[42:36] going through and
[42:39] um so uh you know with everything that
[42:42] that comes afterwards but we want to
[42:44] remember them in prayer that the Lord
[42:46] will just continue to give them strength
[42:48] and and uh and comfort and then as well
[42:51] to uh sister Stephanie's family as well
[42:53] you know she had lost uh her nephew
[42:57] here at the U beginning of the week and
[43:00] so we just want to continue to remember
[43:01] them in prayer as well sometimes there's
[43:04] there's a lot of things and times within
[43:06] this life and when we walk that um if
[43:09] we're really honest we don't
[43:12] understand and uh we don't understand
[43:15] sometimes why certain things happen and
[43:17] why certain things take place and and I
[43:20] think of where how that brother brandham
[43:22] mentioned it in this way he said what
[43:24] I've learned he said uh he said it in
[43:26] the message Shalom he said when he went
[43:29] through everything with when his
[43:32] family his wife passed and his child
[43:34] passed he said what I've learned he said
[43:36] is just to put my hand in his hand and
[43:40] to trust him and you know that's
[43:43] something that you know that we can't
[43:46] manufacture it's something that rises
[43:49] from within us that you even look into
[43:52] your own heart and life and say where is
[43:55] this coming from from for it's certainly
[43:59] not coming from my own
[44:03] resolution it's the strength of God Amen
[44:06] and I'm so thankful for that and we have
[44:07] all been in different uh times where we
[44:10] have felt the strength of the Lord and
[44:13] through prayers and so I just want to
[44:15] continue to encourage you those of you
[44:17] as you went through there on Friday
[44:19] evening and you you seen uh brother
[44:22] Richie sister py and the family that was
[44:25] there and I can just say this that is a
[44:28] result of prayer prayer is the most
[44:31] powerful weapon that's ever been put
[44:34] into the hands of the children of God
[44:36] and that's why may God help us never to
[44:39] take it lightly if someone comes upon
[44:42] your heart or you you know just go to
[44:44] prayer for them that's part of our
[44:46] warfare that's part of the Warfare as
[44:48] and and so we just want to remember
[44:51] remember that in prayer as well amen
[44:54] also remembering next weekend um
[44:56] Saturday Saturday at 6:00 brother Trevor
[44:59] Eman will be here to minister and then
[45:01] as well as on Sunday morning at 11: so
[45:04] we want to um remember that in prayer as
[45:07] well I want to look here in Joshua
[45:10] chapter 8 and uh and I want to read a
[45:14] few verses of
[45:16] scripture and this is beginning in verse
[45:18] 30 Joshua chapter 8 and verse
[45:22] 30 then Joshua built an altar unto the
[45:26] Lord God of Israel in Mount eel as Moses
[45:31] the servant of the Lord commanded the
[45:33] children of Israel as it is written in
[45:36] the book of the law of Moses an altar of
[45:39] whole Stones over which no man hath lift
[45:42] up any iron and they offered thereon
[45:46] burnt offerings unto the Lord and
[45:49] sacrificed peace offerings and he wrote
[45:52] thereupon the stones a copy of the law
[45:54] of Moses which he wrote in the presence
[45:57] of the children of Israel and all Israel
[46:00] and their elders and officers and their
[46:03] judges stood on this side the ark and on
[46:06] that side before the priest the Levites
[46:09] which bear the Ark of the Lord as well
[46:11] as the stranger as he that was born
[46:14] among them half of them over against
[46:16] Mount garim and half of them over
[46:19] against Mount ebal as Moses the servant
[46:22] of the Lord had commanded before that
[46:24] they should Bless the people of Israel
[46:27] and afterward he read all the
[46:30] words of the law the blessings and
[46:35] cursings according to all that is
[46:37] written in the book of the law there was
[46:40] not a word of all that Moses commanded
[46:43] which Joshua read not before all the
[46:47] congregation of Israel with the women
[46:49] and the little ones and the strangers
[46:52] that were conversant among
[46:55] them and I just like like to speak here
[46:57] this morning on time of renewal may God
[47:02] bless you and bless the reading of the
[47:03] word as you're being
[47:06] seated say brother Bill we'll certainly
[47:08] be praying for you
[47:10] yeah I just found that out the other day
[47:12] on a meeting with brother Paul that that
[47:15] you are
[47:16] going so I said it must have been
[47:18] definitely spur of the moment uh so
[47:20] we'll certainly be praying for you may
[47:22] God may God just uh bless you richly
[47:24] you've been such a blessing Amen to
[47:26] those the country there and and
[47:28] interpreting in Central America and um
[47:32] so I know that I know that uh the people
[47:35] will be really refreshed to see you and
[47:37] so we just certainly want to remember
[47:39] brother Bill in prayer how many how many
[47:41] days are you going to be
[47:43] gone this there you'll be coming back
[47:46] this coming Saturday night that's
[47:47] because you're traveling with a
[47:50] pastor and brother Paul is noted he is
[47:53] very specific to say I'm not a
[47:55] missionary so so uh uh that's wonderful
[47:59] so we want to remember brother Bill in
[48:01] prayer as he um is away I want to take a
[48:06] look here at this thought and I actually
[48:08] uh here was um was prepared and
[48:12] preparing to go into a different way
[48:14] actually thought all the way up through
[48:17] um yesterday and this thought I had come
[48:20] would looked at here before and just the
[48:22] Lord just I I couldn't get away from it
[48:24] and even in the wee hours of the morning
[48:27] and um so we want to approach this here
[48:30] this morning and I want us to consider
[48:33] where we are standing when we read from
[48:35] the book of Joshua we recognize that as
[48:38] Believers that the book of Ephesians and
[48:42] the Book of Joshua is is an absolute
[48:45] parallel and it speaks of the the time
[48:48] and the hour and the season that we're
[48:50] living in Paul would write in Romans 8
[48:54] that the whole earth is groaning and
[48:57] travailing waiting for the manifestation
[49:00] of the sons of God that's the promise of
[49:03] God that is upon the Church of the
[49:07] Living God in this hour and I want you
[49:10] to think that within that you you are I
[49:13] are not able uh to make ourselves or to
[49:17] bring forth in our own selves that
[49:19] manifestation but brother Bram would
[49:22] would put it so clearly in the adoption
[49:24] series that how that when this word that
[49:28] God is opening and what God would be
[49:30] speaking forth when he's making known
[49:32] the mystery of God and that mystery of
[49:35] God is where that God himself coming
[49:38] down paying the price tabernacling fully
[49:42] deity within that body of the Lord Jesus
[49:46] and then the sending back of the Holy
[49:49] Spirit back upon the Church of the
[49:51] Living God to where that now it's it's
[49:54] God living his own life through you and
[49:57] I that's that's the achievement of God
[50:01] see it's just like any man who has a
[50:04] work or has something on his mind that
[50:06] he wants to do he starts out with a plan
[50:09] and starts out with a purpose and God
[50:11] God said as has spoke of this all the
[50:15] way through through the Old Testament
[50:17] through Ezekiel through so many over and
[50:19] over of God's desire and purpose to so
[50:23] get back to a place of fellowship with
[50:26] his children children and that place of
[50:28] Fellowship is that where God himself has
[50:31] come to the very depths of our life and
[50:35] this is where that you know the Holy
[50:36] Spirit works on our life to call our
[50:39] life through justification in Repentance
[50:42] and then the same spirit of God begins
[50:44] to work on our life to set our mind in
[50:46] order for Holiness and begins to work
[50:49] then through the sanctifying power of
[50:51] the blood to clean out the worldly
[50:53] desires from our life because God has a
[50:56] purpose that his purpose is to fill us
[51:00] with his spirit and then after we have
[51:02] been filled with the spirit of God then
[51:06] there begins to come forth a growth of a
[51:09] son and daughter of God and I want you
[51:11] to understand that when we are speaking
[51:14] of uh the of the working of the Holy
[51:16] Spirit and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:19] it's not just a change of desires but it
[51:22] is where that our lives have become so
[51:25] United with God word where it's it there
[51:28] is an amen that rises from our hearts
[51:31] there's not when we have been born again
[51:34] there's not one word of God that we
[51:37] can't say Amen
[51:38] to so so I just say it in this way the
[51:42] word has not come to discourage us it
[51:44] comes to encourage us if where wherever
[51:47] we find ourselves at in our walk with
[51:49] God no matter where we're at we always
[51:51] want to be pressing forward that's
[51:55] that's always the call that's always the
[51:57] direction and so when we consider this
[51:59] and look at where that God himself has
[52:02] has brought the people of Israel to this
[52:06] place and they have already come through
[52:09] two great battles they've they've come
[52:11] across the river they they died to self
[52:13] that's what Jordan is a type of and then
[52:16] death to self Then There came the
[52:18] circumcision where there is a cutting
[52:21] away of all the Surplus flesh a dying
[52:23] completely to the world and being
[52:26] completely dedicated to the word of God
[52:30] and you know to think about it when you
[52:32] know when there is no longer any lean or
[52:35] any hold you know how it is if you were
[52:37] going to buy a piece of property if
[52:39] there was anything against that property
[52:41] you have to pay that in order to release
[52:44] that property it might be a pass tax
[52:46] bill it might be uh you know an overdue
[52:49] water bill i' I've read those things
[52:50] where it can be sometimes in the
[52:52] thousands but you recognize that what
[52:54] the circumcision of the Holy Spirit does
[52:57] cuz Paul brings that of what was given
[52:59] in Tye where they would be circumcised
[53:02] In the Flesh Paul says now that we are
[53:05] circumcised with that circumcision that
[53:07] is not with hands whereby it is the
[53:11] putting away of the body of this death
[53:14] and you would look and say well I'm
[53:15] still here within this body of death but
[53:18] Paul is dealing with the complete uh uh
[53:22] removing of that nature that that you
[53:26] and I lived under and it's completely
[53:29] separating unto God to where you and I
[53:32] are no longer Twain but now we have been
[53:37] United with God and so with that here we
[53:40] are we've heard about the Covenant we
[53:43] hear we feel the spirit of the Covenant
[53:46] moving Upon Our Lives drawing us but now
[53:49] through circumcision we have become one
[53:52] with the God who made the Covenant so
[53:56] it's no longer to it's not us it's not
[53:59] us and and like the prophet said in the
[54:01] token where we're you're they were
[54:03] offering up sacrifices here and the law
[54:06] was written over here but he says now
[54:08] the difference under this Blood of the
[54:11] Lord Jesus and through this circumcision
[54:14] it is now coming under the blood which
[54:17] is the atonement for our sins and the
[54:20] word not two separate things the spirit
[54:23] of God and the word of God are one one
[54:26] and the same and that's why that when
[54:29] when there has come that uniting this is
[54:32] where then the word has become flesh
[54:36] that's what sets the difference between
[54:38] just the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[54:41] now we're the word himself moving into
[54:44] our lives because we can have there can
[54:47] be baptisms on our spirit and on our
[54:51] flesh but it will never last but it's
[54:55] God it God's desire was to come to the
[54:57] very innermost part of our life and this
[55:01] is why he said let them make me a
[55:03] sanctuary that I may dwell among them in
[55:06] the midst of them it was God laying out
[55:08] his type all the way through that he
[55:10] might dwell inside of man as a matter of
[55:13] fact when he takes us there to
[55:14] Revelations 4 and you see when John is
[55:18] is is addressed and there is an open
[55:20] door that is set before them and he says
[55:24] come up hither and when John is beckoned
[55:27] to come up hither what he what he
[55:29] beholds is one who sat on a throne and
[55:32] if you look at all the characteristics
[55:34] that's wrote there in Revelations 4 you
[55:38] actually see the temple of the Living
[55:41] God and it's not something of brick and
[55:43] mortar but the Temple of the Living God
[55:46] is the body of Jesus Christ it's God
[55:50] coming and dwelling in the 4 and 20
[55:52] Elders it's God that is coming in the
[55:54] midst of our life and he's the
[55:57] influencer his desires to be the
[55:59] influence of Our Lives Hallelujah I
[56:02] don't think anyone who's ever come in
[56:05] contact with God would desire anything
[56:07] less than that God would be the sole
[56:10] influence of our life I want him to be
[56:13] over the decisions I make for he even
[56:16] knows what lays ahead of me tomorrow and
[56:19] next week God grant to me the influence
[56:23] of the Holy Spirit maybe it's just
[56:24] something to move me in a certain way
[56:26] this morning so I'll be ready and fitted
[56:29] for when he will I'll be presented with
[56:31] that decision before me tomorrow but I
[56:34] want to look at this here in our journey
[56:37] uh in looking at this on overcoming
[56:40] hindrances where we've been at and also
[56:43] looking in our lives of of these uh
[56:46] moments in the promised land because you
[56:49] realize that as we've come into the
[56:51] promised land and crossing over and
[56:53] being circumcised we're we're not free
[56:56] from Battle as a matter of fact this is
[56:58] the land of
[57:00] overcoming and so remember that
[57:02] overcoming itself is always if if you'll
[57:05] just take two words if you have the
[57:07] table app on your phone or in your
[57:09] tablet just take these two words and go
[57:11] directly to the message how can I
[57:13] overcome and it's the two words already
[57:15] don't don't quote them but just leave
[57:17] them separate already and overcome and
[57:20] there's there there are three exact
[57:22] statements that the prophet makes in how
[57:25] can I overcome and it deals with where
[57:27] you and I must and realize and recognize
[57:31] that the God in us has already overcome
[57:35] the thing that we're facing and to
[57:38] recognize him in the midst of Temptation
[57:41] by just staying humble to his word Lord
[57:44] I need you in this situation Lord I Need
[57:47] Your Grace and and here he's already you
[57:50] see what you and I already have within
[57:52] us when you have been born of the spirit
[57:55] of God you already have within you the
[57:58] overcoming power and that overcoming
[58:01] power is necessary because in our lives
[58:04] not only is Jericho and AI but it goes
[58:08] even much deeper than that because once
[58:10] Jericho Ai and sometime some of the
[58:14] bigger cities and and Kings then it's
[58:16] time to come into our inheritance this
[58:19] taking of Jericho this of AI is is God
[58:23] letting letting us know this is the same
[58:26] plan that will be used when you come
[58:29] into your individual position and
[58:32] remember Satan's desire within this that
[58:35] we we have to battle with they had to
[58:37] battle with it and the prophet picks it
[58:39] up through the adoption through as I was
[58:41] with Moses on and on and he would talk
[58:43] about how he says that you know many
[58:45] times we have Ephraim wanting to raise
[58:47] corn in manasseh's corner and somehow we
[58:50] we feel and we can become when we look
[58:53] at one another and instead of and we can
[58:55] become to feel insufficient instead of
[58:58] recognizing God God has a place he has a
[59:01] part for our life and that part is just
[59:04] as essential it's just as important it
[59:07] may not be on the platform it may not be
[59:09] anything noticeable but you know what as
[59:11] a real son and daughter of God it
[59:13] doesn't matter that our name is called
[59:15] it doesn't matter that we're noticed the
[59:17] one thing about it is is Lord that I'm
[59:19] doing what you've asked me to do and
[59:21] that the word of God is living out fully
[59:24] in my life this is why the prophet would
[59:27] going on to say he says Oh how we need
[59:29] an the leader in this end time he said
[59:32] to come with that word he said because
[59:34] those individuals of Israel when they
[59:37] came in to their promised land and they
[59:40] came into their position as they abided
[59:43] there they became the cream of the crop
[59:47] so it's always Satan's desire to somehow
[59:49] belittle minimize what God is calling us
[59:52] to do and then then and then you know
[59:55] then you could sometimes battle and the
[59:57] the battle will come and well you know
[59:58] this one's a greater you know this is a
[1:00:00] greater tribe and you got a greater
[1:00:01] position or this all kinds thoughts and
[1:00:03] and everything is all around but I I
[1:00:05] want you to understand those things are
[1:00:07] only there to try to hinder us and keep
[1:00:09] us back from yielding because when our
[1:00:12] mind is all taken up with so many things
[1:00:15] like that and occupied and sometimes
[1:00:17] we're trying to prove our position in
[1:00:19] our mind that's Satan's trick and trap
[1:00:22] is to try to get us to where we are
[1:00:25] standing constantly as trying to justify
[1:00:28] our position of who we are this is where
[1:00:32] the achievement that belongs in the
[1:00:34] heart of the believer is to believe
[1:00:36] every word of God and that includes the
[1:00:38] word that God has spoken over your life
[1:00:41] and the word that you see working in
[1:00:44] your life that you yourself are standing
[1:00:46] in amazement at the god you see working
[1:00:49] in your
[1:00:52] life and we come to these moments this
[1:00:56] will be a
[1:00:57] part in in in the journey as as as a as
[1:01:02] different ones will take their position
[1:01:04] so as we even as coming into position
[1:01:07] these will this will always be this this
[1:01:10] thing that we're going to speak on just
[1:01:11] for a few moments on a time of renewal
[1:01:14] this will always be a part of our lives
[1:01:18] and I just want to say this to you that
[1:01:20] times are renewal are not are not
[1:01:22] moments called by man right that's good
[1:01:25] these are not called by
[1:01:27] man but times are renewal are called by
[1:01:31] the holy
[1:01:32] spirit it's God who orchestrates the
[1:01:36] moment it's God who orchestrates the
[1:01:38] time for Renewal if you know you have
[1:01:41] designated times just like we've done
[1:01:43] here in the church in different times uh
[1:01:45] in your home sometimes you give it a
[1:01:47] Fresh coat of paint or a new thing of
[1:01:49] carpet or or a new a new flooring or you
[1:01:52] get new chairs or new furniture you
[1:01:53] don't burn the whole house down you
[1:01:55] simply renew what is there and that's
[1:01:59] the same thing in our life is that this
[1:02:01] is why the prophet would take such time
[1:02:04] in the adoption series over and over you
[1:02:07] find it through every part and and and
[1:02:10] it's not just in the adoption series
[1:02:11] it's all the way through the message
[1:02:13] where the Prophet would talk about the
[1:02:14] fear the scare that's among the church
[1:02:17] he said oh that's what we're here to
[1:02:18] drive out and let me just tell you there
[1:02:20] is there's not a man that can drive that
[1:02:22] out but God himself coming present
[1:02:26] through this word and the Mystery of God
[1:02:29] just being ministered right there it
[1:02:31] will drive back fear and it ministers
[1:02:34] courage it ministers ability it's a
[1:02:37] vision that breaks over your
[1:02:41] life that's good and so these times of
[1:02:45] renewal they're very there there things
[1:02:48] that God would call us to and a renewal
[1:02:52] itself I want you just to think of this
[1:02:54] a renewal itself
[1:02:57] requires
[1:03:01] discernment it requires
[1:03:05] honesty and
[1:03:07] humility discernment honesty and
[1:03:12] humility I want to just read this here
[1:03:15] out of Deuteronomy
[1:03:17] 11 this was a place where God and I want
[1:03:20] you just to think of this in Deuteronomy
[1:03:22] 11: 18 and this is this is a promise
[1:03:27] that God has made it was even uh it was
[1:03:30] even that which would be uh very much
[1:03:34] present and reminded in this moment
[1:03:36] where Joshua is is is leading the
[1:03:40] children of Israel in a place of
[1:03:43] renewal they've just come through AI
[1:03:46] they've come through remember with AI
[1:03:48] they come through a great battle in
[1:03:50] Jericho then they come into Ai and when
[1:03:52] they come into AI there was sin that was
[1:03:55] in the camp right and because of one
[1:03:59] person that had gotten out of line in
[1:04:03] their walk it brought the entirety of
[1:04:06] the army out of line right right and so
[1:04:11] he wants you to understand that it just
[1:04:13] even goes to show that God's intention
[1:04:16] for Unity is that how that in our lives
[1:04:20] that where we would be so United with
[1:04:24] his spirit so United Ed with his word in
[1:04:27] every phase of our life in every part of
[1:04:30] our life because when this took place
[1:04:33] where aen went and in direct
[1:04:35] Disobedience listen achen achen did not
[1:04:39] have to go there and say well let me see
[1:04:41] you know this this garment looks pretty
[1:04:43] good and let me go pray over it and my
[1:04:45] this wedge of go you know I'm having a
[1:04:47] little bit of financial difficulty let
[1:04:49] me go no no he knew he knew there there
[1:04:52] was a word that was already that had
[1:04:54] given leadership in that battle right
[1:04:57] and if you look at it if you just if
[1:04:59] when you study that this is what's
[1:05:01] powerful in the Book of Joshua you'll
[1:05:03] find that God had told them in that
[1:05:05] moment that when you come into Jericho
[1:05:08] burn it
[1:05:09] all don't take silver don't take gold
[1:05:13] come on now and when they went to Ai and
[1:05:16] after the success God told them bring
[1:05:20] the silver and gold out you see it's
[1:05:22] waiting on God
[1:05:25] God has a timing for everything it you
[1:05:28] know it would just seem like well we're
[1:05:29] just going to rush through everything's
[1:05:31] going to be done the same no there's
[1:05:33] things that God has from every single
[1:05:35] battle but we never want to take things
[1:05:38] for granted in other words Our Lives as
[1:05:41] Believers as the scripture said if you
[1:05:43] be led by the spirit you're not under
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] law the sons of God are led by the
[1:05:50] spirit of God we don't want to take
[1:05:53] anything for granted mean we know that
[1:05:55] God God is a god of pattern and God will
[1:05:58] work by the patterns of his word but we
[1:06:00] want to be inclined to the spirit of God
[1:06:02] because God knows exactly what you and I
[1:06:06] have need of at that
[1:06:08] moment and his will his will for our
[1:06:11] lives how many you believe God's will is
[1:06:13] for your life you believe God has a
[1:06:16] perfect will then you let me just tell
[1:06:17] you something if God's perfect will for
[1:06:20] your life I want you to understand
[1:06:21] that's his word and his word cannot fail
[1:06:25] amen amen the prophet tells us he said
[1:06:28] God will make the conditions match
[1:06:31] what's required for the season God's
[1:06:34] responsible for that I say God help me
[1:06:37] just to just to lay aside everything so
[1:06:39] that I can be influenced to move into
[1:06:41] the right
[1:06:43] conditions a time of renewal they needed
[1:06:46] this moment of renewal you know when
[1:06:48] Israel had come into the land here and
[1:06:51] here was a direct Disobedience they did
[1:06:53] something that was done that knew better
[1:06:57] than to do you say well brother Samuel
[1:07:00] that would be
[1:07:01] willful well remember there were 16 men
[1:07:04] that was killed brother BR said there's
[1:07:07] times where there's traps that's laid
[1:07:09] for us then he said there's other times
[1:07:12] where there's things he said you'll do
[1:07:13] willfully he said but just so you
[1:07:15] understand whether it's a trap or
[1:07:18] whether it's willful he said everything
[1:07:20] that we sow we will
[1:07:23] reap I can't go there to this morning
[1:07:26] but I want you to understand God's not
[1:07:27] listen that whole thing is not God
[1:07:29] holding something over our head but
[1:07:31] listen we want to we want to reverence
[1:07:34] the leading of the Holy Spirit we want
[1:07:37] to reverence his leading because uh with
[1:07:40] within these things there was 16 men
[1:07:43] innocent the prophet called it innocent
[1:07:46] men that paid with their life listen
[1:07:48] these 16 men did not even have a speck
[1:07:51] of gold gold dust they did not even have
[1:07:53] a piece of a babyl Ian garment they
[1:07:57] perished because one person got out of
[1:08:01] line one person did not subject their
[1:08:05] own will to the word of God you see the
[1:08:08] the token it's applying the token this
[1:08:11] is why the token when we talk of
[1:08:13] applying the token it's not just
[1:08:15] something that well you know I've
[1:08:17] received the token well how do you know
[1:08:19] how do you know youve received the token
[1:08:21] well you say well my desires have
[1:08:22] changed but let's let's go let's move
[1:08:24] deeper is the desire fully to the things
[1:08:27] of
[1:08:28] God because you've got to it's got to go
[1:08:31] deeper than just sanctification it's got
[1:08:33] to come to a place of full
[1:08:36] relationship where the world itself has
[1:08:39] no longer a claim on your life there has
[1:08:41] come a full circumcision with the hands
[1:08:45] without hands but by the spirit amen
[1:08:49] because that's what brings us into the
[1:08:51] Covenant that's what brings us into
[1:08:53] Union Ruth could never have come in to
[1:08:55] where she came to and not boas one who
[1:08:58] was circumcised brought her in right is
[1:09:01] that right the daughters of ZF had had
[1:09:04] no there's no way for them to obtain
[1:09:06] their inheritance and you can read it in
[1:09:08] numbers you can read it in Joshua and
[1:09:11] they had no way to get their father's
[1:09:13] inheritance but they weren't going to
[1:09:15] let their father's inheritance just fall
[1:09:17] dormant there was something that Rose
[1:09:19] within them and
[1:09:21] said we must have our father's
[1:09:24] inheritance I want you to understand
[1:09:25] understand they they at that time they
[1:09:27] had no
[1:09:30] promise they had no promise to stand
[1:09:32] there before Moses to stand before the
[1:09:35] to stand there but you know what it was
[1:09:38] a it was a call of God that was burning
[1:09:40] in their hearts and God answered Moses
[1:09:44] and said the daughters of zad have spoke
[1:09:49] correctly they shall marry in their own
[1:09:53] tribe and in their own tribe then the
[1:09:56] inheritance of their father is
[1:09:59] retained it shows you and I that the
[1:10:02] only way that we come into our
[1:10:05] inheritance is we must have a complete
[1:10:08] New Birth a union with the man Christ
[1:10:13] Jesus with the Holy Ghost in our
[1:10:16] life to where he the love of our
[1:10:21] life you see we could love him out here
[1:10:23] in the spirit realm that's fing love
[1:10:25] that's as deep as as a as a man or woman
[1:10:27] can go but it takes the agape
[1:10:30] love Hallelujah which is God's Own love
[1:10:33] to come down to the inside on that Soul
[1:10:37] where you love God you love his word you
[1:10:40] love him of more than anything including
[1:10:44] flesh and blood and your own will
[1:10:49] am that's what the power of circumcision
[1:10:51] does it separates you from Egypt Egypt
[1:10:53] no longer has a tie on you
[1:10:57] but now here's this
[1:10:59] renewal a renewal a time that when
[1:11:03] Israel they had come into the into this
[1:11:06] place and man they come to a place in AI
[1:11:11] they come back to Victory well how did
[1:11:13] they get back to Victory we kind of we
[1:11:15] looked at it last week and how that God
[1:11:19] had them under the leadership of Joshua
[1:11:22] to make as though that they were
[1:11:24] retreating as they did the first time
[1:11:27] but you know what it actually was it was
[1:11:30] a people what AI thought was a whipped
[1:11:34] people once again but what it was it was
[1:11:38] a people that had surrendered their
[1:11:41] rights that's right and that whole
[1:11:44] display on the
[1:11:46] battlefield is what had taken place in
[1:11:49] their hearts already they had returned
[1:11:54] to the Lord from whom they had departed
[1:11:56] amen you see this is why it's it's so
[1:11:59] easy our hearts can depart our hearts
[1:12:04] can get
[1:12:06] away so brother Samuel I'm sealed with
[1:12:08] the spirit of God but the scripture says
[1:12:11] Ephesians 1 Ephesians 4 this is part of
[1:12:13] our Joshua grieve not the spirit of God
[1:12:17] whereby you're sealed you see it isn't
[1:12:19] your
[1:12:20] soul when that Soul has been sealed it
[1:12:23] it's never never the soul
[1:12:27] that that commits the act of grieving
[1:12:29] but it's when things get into the spirit
[1:12:34] that is so into the mind that's so
[1:12:37] good you no doubt every one of us you've
[1:12:40] had to stand and say forgive me for
[1:12:43] something I've said or something I've
[1:12:44] done and and you know there's something
[1:12:46] that has moved you that has pricked your
[1:12:49] heart that has brought you to that place
[1:12:51] to to to repent of that and if you've
[1:12:54] really been con sealed with the spirit
[1:12:56] of God when you recognize you've done
[1:12:59] wrong you're ready to
[1:13:02] repent because we're not an island to
[1:13:04] ourselves and well you know I just on my
[1:13:07] note we are a
[1:13:08] body we experience Victory as a
[1:13:12] body yes and we can also experience
[1:13:16] defeat as a
[1:13:19] body same thing as a home same thing as
[1:13:21] a family same thing as a church this is
[1:13:24] why the the prophet would tell us
[1:13:26] regarding this he said Canan in the
[1:13:29] adoption series he said did not speak
[1:13:33] that they're of of of a of a of a
[1:13:36] perfect as far as where there's no
[1:13:38] there's no battles there's no Wars he
[1:13:41] said but what it did testify of and what
[1:13:43] it did speak that it called for was a
[1:13:46] perfect
[1:13:48] walk and that perfect walk was lining up
[1:13:51] with God and lining up with one another
[1:13:55] you see we really can't be in line with
[1:13:57] God if we're out of line with our
[1:14:00] brother it don't work that way the Bible
[1:14:03] said how can you say that you love him
[1:14:06] whom you have not seen and you despise
[1:14:09] him who you do
[1:14:12] see you don't want that Spirit of Cain a
[1:14:15] hatred and a malice and a
[1:14:17] vengeful amen sometimes that Spirit of
[1:14:21] malice listen this is why the scripture
[1:14:23] said putting away all
[1:14:29] bitterness sometimes in offenses that
[1:14:32] have come in your life here and even
[1:14:37] sometimes when you were a child let me
[1:14:39] just say this to you and I want to just
[1:14:41] say it very graciously you have to deal
[1:14:44] with that absolutely you have if you
[1:14:47] don't deal with it it will dominate your
[1:14:50] life it'll dominate your relationship
[1:14:53] between you and God you say I've got the
[1:14:55] Holy Ghost but remember our lives are a
[1:15:01] channel this is why when the prophet
[1:15:03] preaches greatest battle ever fought not
[1:15:06] only is he bringing us to a place of the
[1:15:08] new birth but he spends a great deal in
[1:15:11] that message where the application works
[1:15:14] day in and day out in our lives of how
[1:15:17] Satan will come to batter against
[1:15:20] us and I say that because I understand
[1:15:24] as I'm standing here as a pastor and as
[1:15:26] a minister of the Gospel there's great
[1:15:28] needs Among
[1:15:30] Us there's needs sometimes that when I
[1:15:33] can look at sometimes it's that if
[1:15:36] there's one thing that God has taught me
[1:15:38] over the years is things that you see
[1:15:41] being expressed outwardly are not always
[1:15:44] so black and white that's right that's
[1:15:47] good you say where do you draw that from
[1:15:49] very simply the prophet when he talked
[1:15:51] about in his meetings he said remember
[1:15:54] you had you had Oral Roberts and all the
[1:15:56] rest of them going through prayer lines
[1:15:57] laying hands praying for him just
[1:15:59] praying for him and brother BR says I in
[1:16:02] my meetings I catch what falls off of
[1:16:05] Ora
[1:16:07] Roberts that's and those
[1:16:10] men there's no doubt those individuals
[1:16:13] felt a temporary
[1:16:16] relief are you hearing me
[1:16:19] now but the prophet said what God has
[1:16:22] given this ministry for is to catch
[1:16:26] what is hindering that from fully coming
[1:16:28] to pass in other words we don't want to
[1:16:31] have where it's you know where God it's
[1:16:34] built up to a certain place in our lives
[1:16:36] and all of a sudden my it's building
[1:16:38] building all of a sudden we you hit you
[1:16:40] hit like a you hit a roadblock or you
[1:16:42] you hit a blockage and and here we are
[1:16:44] back into the same position but to
[1:16:46] realize God give me the grace even if I
[1:16:50] don't know where it's at to deal with
[1:16:52] where the hindrance is at in my life
[1:16:56] remember I told you it's not us calling
[1:16:58] for a time of renewal it's God who calls
[1:17:03] renewals
[1:17:05] amen very good because many times
[1:17:08] bitterness malice Envy all of these are
[1:17:12] matters of the heart yes
[1:17:15] sir yes sir when Paul writes them
[1:17:17] they're not a matter of the Soul they're
[1:17:18] a matter of the heart and you know what
[1:17:20] this is the thing is that every one of
[1:17:23] those things that we of their malice
[1:17:26] bitterness Envy all of that that all has
[1:17:29] to do with a heart that's
[1:17:36] offended it's what it has to do
[1:17:39] with whether it's from earli in our life
[1:17:43] whether it's from now let me just let me
[1:17:45] just say what the word has said offenses
[1:17:49] will
[1:17:51] come I'm going to be very very clear
[1:17:57] you can either choose to
[1:17:59] live without offense in your life that's
[1:18:02] your choice yes sir you can either
[1:18:05] choose to live with it and you say how
[1:18:07] do I know what it is whatever it is that
[1:18:09] you continues to come back and dominate
[1:18:12] your thoughts and some things that even
[1:18:14] if it's if it's feelings you have
[1:18:16] towards somebody else or somebody's done
[1:18:18] your wrong I don't care who they
[1:18:21] are yes that must be cleaned amen from
[1:18:25] your
[1:18:29] spirit now that isn't I'm just saying
[1:18:31] this from my heart that is not something
[1:18:33] remember a time of renewal is not man
[1:18:37] calling it it's God calling it and when
[1:18:41] God calls a meeting God's got a
[1:18:44] purpose there's things that God wants to
[1:18:46] deal with because he wants to be
[1:18:51] expressed through our lives
[1:18:56] requires discernment honesty and
[1:19:00] humility now I want you to think of
[1:19:03] this within this within our within the
[1:19:05] spirit because it's I tell you how
[1:19:08] serious it is it's a serious enough of
[1:19:11] missing the
[1:19:14] Rapture you can allow things listen
[1:19:17] listen Brother Brad when he preaches
[1:19:18] lamb and the dove you find where the
[1:19:20] enemy at different times has got in on
[1:19:22] people's lives that they were in journey
[1:19:25] and Satan sees them in Journey to
[1:19:28] receive and and becoming one with God
[1:19:31] and he comes into in a moment in a
[1:19:34] subtleness and he comes in such a way
[1:19:36] and sometimes it isn't something that's
[1:19:38] brand new if we can be honest this is
[1:19:41] something that has affected me or
[1:19:44] bothered me and now the same action
[1:19:46] comes back out again and he Grieves away
[1:19:49] the spirit of
[1:19:51] God this is why within our lives
[1:19:55] even after coming across when we have
[1:19:57] listen you say brother Samuel missing
[1:19:59] the Rapture when we've come into the new
[1:20:00] birth well when you've been born again
[1:20:02] and under the token you won't miss the
[1:20:05] Rapture but the prophet tells us in the
[1:20:07] adoption series for things that you've
[1:20:10] let go
[1:20:12] unconfessed you'll give an account for
[1:20:15] it when you stand before the Judgment
[1:20:18] seat of Christ not the white Throne not
[1:20:21] the white Throne judgment seat
[1:20:24] the Bible says in the book of
[1:20:26] Corinthians we must give an account for
[1:20:28] the
[1:20:29] Deeds Done in this
[1:20:32] body well Lord I could have been if you
[1:20:34] know if everything would have been said
[1:20:36] no we we give an account for the Deeds
[1:20:38] Done in this body nobody else will give
[1:20:40] an account for us we give an account I
[1:20:42] want to make my calling an election
[1:20:46] sure this moment of
[1:20:50] renewal here in Deuteronomy 11 where God
[1:20:53] is calling them to
[1:20:55] God's calling them back to that place of
[1:20:58] the word and he's tell him I don't have
[1:21:00] time to read all of this but he has told
[1:21:03] them what he what he wanted them to do
[1:21:06] with the word let it be frontlets on
[1:21:08] your eyes let it be on the doorpost Let
[1:21:09] It Be and let it be all around you in
[1:21:12] other words surround your life with the
[1:21:15] word in other words don't make a step
[1:21:18] without the word being
[1:21:20] there anything that you're looking at
[1:21:23] don't look at it without looking at it
[1:21:24] through the
[1:21:26] word brother Samuel that was the Old
[1:21:28] Testament that was a
[1:21:30] type that was a type of where you and I
[1:21:33] are called to live in this
[1:21:35] hour and this
[1:21:37] renewal God calls them to I want you to
[1:21:41] notice the certainty uh Brianna give me
[1:21:43] Deuteronomy
[1:21:44] 11 uh verse 22 let me just skip to
[1:21:49] there notice what God is speaking
[1:21:52] concerning his word for if ye shall
[1:21:54] diligent ently ly keep all these
[1:21:56] Commandments which I command you to do
[1:21:58] them to love the Lord your God to walk
[1:22:01] in all his ways and to cleave unto him
[1:22:04] then will the Lord drive out all these
[1:22:07] nations from before you and you shall
[1:22:10] possess greater Nations mightier than
[1:22:13] yourself every place where on the souls
[1:22:16] of your feet shall tread shall be yours
[1:22:19] from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the
[1:22:21] river the river Euphrates even to the
[1:22:23] uttermost Sea shall be your Coast there
[1:22:26] shall be no man able to stand before you
[1:22:29] for the Lord your God shall lay the fear
[1:22:32] of you and the dread of you upon all the
[1:22:37] land that you shall tread Upon A has
[1:22:40] said unto
[1:22:41] you let me ask you
[1:22:44] does when you open your eyes on your bed
[1:22:47] at
[1:22:48] morning does Hell
[1:22:51] tremble does the enemy tremble and say
[1:22:54] oh dear
[1:22:56] God they've made it through the
[1:23:00] night you say Brother s how does that
[1:23:02] happen that we got to be loud and
[1:23:04] boisterous no no it's a
[1:23:07] simple humble daily walk with
[1:23:13] God letting the word be the guide of
[1:23:17] your life and when you let the word be
[1:23:20] the guide of your life that's what makes
[1:23:23] Satan nervous
[1:23:26] are you hearing me this is why Satan
[1:23:29] when the new church the here the church
[1:23:32] was born on the day of Pentecost this is
[1:23:35] why that Satan himself even before
[1:23:38] Pentecost he notice Judas was the son of
[1:23:42] predition he had a knowledge of the
[1:23:44] Mysteries Second To None can I just say
[1:23:48] it plainly he was the best preacher out
[1:23:51] of all of
[1:23:52] them I'm quoting a dire
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:56] word okay he was Second To None even to
[1:23:59] where that Satan would see okay now now
[1:24:02] I see what's happening there's a group
[1:24:04] and there's a gathering of people then
[1:24:05] the Bible said he had transformed his
[1:24:08] angels into angels of
[1:24:12] light oh I have something enlightening
[1:24:14] for
[1:24:16] you you you think there wasn't a
[1:24:19] presence that didn't that doesn't
[1:24:21] accompany an angel Hey listen demons are
[1:24:24] Fallen
[1:24:26] Angels but there are elect
[1:24:29] Angels those that did not
[1:24:31] fall and just as the angels of God are
[1:24:35] in this building this morning moving
[1:24:38] Upon Our Hearts and you say brother
[1:24:40] Samuel I I want to invite him even more
[1:24:42] I'll tell you what the prophet said in
[1:24:44] demonology series he said when we are in
[1:24:46] our hearts set for a moment of renewal
[1:24:50] in the Holy Ghost the angels of God have
[1:24:53] taken their POS position and they are
[1:24:55] moving all around through the aisles why
[1:24:58] because that that that's here they are
[1:25:00] they they're gathered here the angels of
[1:25:02] God are gathered it's just man this is
[1:25:04] this is welcoming this is a welcoming
[1:25:06] moment when you've got hearts that are
[1:25:08] willing to welcome the word of God the
[1:25:10] prophet preaches in a
[1:25:12] message and he he spoke and I can't
[1:25:14] remember the name the name of the
[1:25:15] message now I having another another
[1:25:17] outline but he speaks of how he says
[1:25:19] here I was I'm in this place he said and
[1:25:22] I see people he said just sitting he he
[1:25:24] said the word's going forth and and and
[1:25:26] they know they're saying things in their
[1:25:28] life and things that's wrong but he said
[1:25:30] you're just sitting he said remember he
[1:25:32] says I was here he said some time ago
[1:25:34] and preach the unpardonable sin and he's
[1:25:37] dealing with the people we've got to
[1:25:39] have a care in this time and let me just
[1:25:41] say it to you like this you want to talk
[1:25:44] about God's grace and God's mercy when
[1:25:46] the prophet preaches in
[1:25:48] 1963 he cares do you care he said why
[1:25:51] don't you ask God create in me a
[1:25:56] careall create in me a care I don't want
[1:26:00] that I don't care attitude create in me
[1:26:02] a care because this is an hour it's
[1:26:06] necessary amen it's necessary to be
[1:26:09] diligent with my walk with
[1:26:12] God Amen we
[1:26:15] wonder this moment of
[1:26:18] renewal because there's times when
[1:26:21] needing renewal
[1:26:24] sometimes our lives can get stale the
[1:26:27] Bible tells us in Psalms 103 that who
[1:26:31] satisfieth my mouth with good things so
[1:26:35] that thy youth is renewed Like an Eagle
[1:26:37] that's Psalms
[1:26:38] 103:5 he ties together renewal is a call
[1:26:43] by God it's a call of his word it's God
[1:26:47] feeding his children and the feeding of
[1:26:51] his children on his unfailing word is
[1:26:54] what brings
[1:26:58] renewal there's no other
[1:27:01] way right I'm not against anything that
[1:27:07] helps but I'm just going to tell you
[1:27:09] this
[1:27:10] friends we're talking about the promised
[1:27:14] land you know to need something more
[1:27:16] than
[1:27:19] psychology I I'm just being very
[1:27:23] Frank you need something more yes well
[1:27:27] you know this I I don't even know why
[1:27:30] sometimes we we don't even know why
[1:27:32] certain things are are are coming about
[1:27:34] and why is it that we gravitate maybe in
[1:27:36] a certain way why is that or we need
[1:27:40] more than a
[1:27:41] psychologist we need the spirit of God
[1:27:43] now I want you to I want to understand
[1:27:45] listen to me now very carefully I'm just
[1:27:48] I'm just following him
[1:27:52] here you you see when I talked about
[1:27:55] that before I believe in prayer lines I
[1:27:59] believe in praying for the sick I
[1:28:00] believe in all that but the
[1:28:03] prophet he takes the message if you have
[1:28:05] not listened to he cares do you care in
[1:28:08] 63 I would advise you to listen to that
[1:28:10] that's a key
[1:28:12] message that that message has been a
[1:28:14] source of influence now for five years
[1:28:18] because here's the problem brother Bram
[1:28:20] says we know the Cure but we've got to
[1:28:23] find the the
[1:28:25] cause and they'll say that over and over
[1:28:27] you see this is why this is why this the
[1:28:29] message itself it's looking deeper than
[1:28:32] just you know I'm going to pray this off
[1:28:34] and so many times so many times you say
[1:28:37] why is it that this is coming back
[1:28:39] through the prayer line for the same
[1:28:40] thing I'm going to give you the words of
[1:28:42] the
[1:28:43] prophet he stood in New York Bellington
[1:28:46] and he says people came through that
[1:28:48] were blind and they saw when they got
[1:28:51] across the platform but he said
[1:28:54] within a few days they came back and
[1:28:57] they were as blind as they ever
[1:29:00] were deaf and everything else and
[1:29:04] yet they that was relief from their
[1:29:08] life and the prophet begins he looks to
[1:29:11] God and he says God what's going
[1:29:14] on are you with me amen this is why
[1:29:16] brother Brandon when you hear him
[1:29:18] Minister this and that and say that
[1:29:20] that's from an earlier part in the
[1:29:22] message but notice how God
[1:29:24] has brought an understanding this is why
[1:29:26] the prophet would say in the adoption
[1:29:28] series part three he says I've learned
[1:29:31] long ago he says I'm not going to get
[1:29:33] and he calls out a sister's name sister
[1:29:35] do you believe Oh Sister you really
[1:29:36] ought to believe sister you know you
[1:29:37] really need to believe Oh Sister you
[1:29:39] know God's word is true sister you know
[1:29:41] you really got to believe he said I've
[1:29:42] learned long ago that doesn't work right
[1:29:48] are you hearing me he said I learned
[1:29:50] that's a son that is maturing yes
[1:29:54] hallelujah it's learning and this is
[1:29:56] what he's pointing to it's the
[1:29:57] sovereignty of God that creates faith in
[1:30:01] the hearts of the people listen let's be
[1:30:04] real we're here for real honest needs in
[1:30:07] our life the Rapture is everything to
[1:30:12] us Divine favor with God I don't have
[1:30:15] time to play around but Lord deal in my
[1:30:19] life create Lord in my heart the faith
[1:30:23] that's needed amen hallelujah back to
[1:30:26] that prayer line the prophet said here's
[1:30:29] what was happening he said those people
[1:30:31] were walking
[1:30:32] in and in the presence of the Angel of
[1:30:36] the Lord it took the condition off their
[1:30:41] life but because they weren't
[1:30:44] sincere at the bottom of it oh my a
[1:30:47] sincere confession it came back you see
[1:30:51] this is you see when there's a sincere
[1:30:53] confession
[1:30:54] it's a separating it's a separating from
[1:30:57] sin it's a separating whatever it is
[1:31:00] Lord I Forgive Me Lord from my wrong
[1:31:02] it's going down to the depths of it Lord
[1:31:05] to
[1:31:06] realize cuz sometimes it takes sickness
[1:31:10] sometimes it takes hardship sometimes it
[1:31:12] takes things God will work in such a way
[1:31:14] to get us to a place to where we finally
[1:31:16] begin to stop looking at others and
[1:31:19] looking around and say God let me look
[1:31:22] inwardly Hallelujah
[1:31:24] amen and Lord when I look inwardly in my
[1:31:27] life I want you to hold my
[1:31:29] hand because there's places in my life
[1:31:33] Hallelujah that are scars that are so
[1:31:36] deep in my spirit that Lord things Lord
[1:31:39] from my life hold my hand Lord God I'm
[1:31:43] willing to go there Lord but you take me
[1:31:46] there
[1:31:47] Lord huah take me there I don't want to
[1:31:51] go on my own if you don't go up if you
[1:31:53] don't go up don't Carry Me fither Lord I
[1:31:56] want to go with you
[1:31:58] Lord guide me Lord in those areas of my
[1:32:01] life that there can be a
[1:32:07] renewal think about this
[1:32:11] Israel this place that we're reading
[1:32:15] about they put this altar it was a place
[1:32:18] that God had told Moses and told Moses
[1:32:21] when they came into the land when you
[1:32:23] would read it
[1:32:24] you would almost wonder why didn't they
[1:32:26] go
[1:32:27] immediately over to this place because
[1:32:31] it was a place Mount ebal where the
[1:32:33] cursings would be read Mount gersam
[1:32:36] where the blessings would be read you've
[1:32:37] read Deuteronomy chapter 28 and not
[1:32:39] things like that and God talks about the
[1:32:41] blessings and the cursings right brother
[1:32:44] BR says You' got he said you've got some
[1:32:45] people he said they they don't they
[1:32:47] don't believe in preaching on things
[1:32:48] like that and talking about cursings he
[1:32:49] said well there he says you know what he
[1:32:51] saidyou better get away from a person
[1:32:52] like that I don't trust him
[1:32:54] because God's word is
[1:32:56] true but I want you to understand right
[1:32:59] here what you seen on Mount eal where
[1:33:01] the cursings are read that's where the
[1:33:03] altar is
[1:33:04] made the altar was not made on Mount
[1:33:07] gersam where the blessings are there has
[1:33:10] to be a sacrifice to take the curse
[1:33:14] there has to be a sacrifice that'll take
[1:33:17] the
[1:33:18] cursings and Israel has just experienced
[1:33:22] this cursing
[1:33:24] sure there's they come they won the
[1:33:25] Battle of AI but it shows you and I a
[1:33:28] very important
[1:33:30] Point God is showing us something here
[1:33:33] that it's true how that judgment broke
[1:33:36] upon the camp of Israel when judgment
[1:33:39] broke then came
[1:33:41] repentance after repentance came
[1:33:45] obedience after obedience came Victory
[1:33:49] and after Victory came blessings that is
[1:33:51] so
[1:33:52] good before any departure from the word
[1:33:57] it was obedience Victory and
[1:34:00] blessings but because somewhere along
[1:34:02] the line where Israel had gone off
[1:34:06] course it was a time for a
[1:34:09] renewal now this when you read of this
[1:34:12] account and look at it within the
[1:34:15] commentators historians and so forth you
[1:34:18] realize that this was not next door to
[1:34:20] AI this journey was 20 to 25
[1:34:25] miles that they would have to make it
[1:34:28] would not be an easy
[1:34:31] Journey but it was a journey that was
[1:34:35] necessary sometimes the journeys that
[1:34:37] you and I are called to make to go into
[1:34:40] the heart and to go into the depth are
[1:34:43] not easy Journeys they're not something
[1:34:46] that just is just right beside us but
[1:34:48] it's places we've got to journey by the
[1:34:52] spirit of God in our lives that is so
[1:34:54] good meaning that sometimes it's not
[1:34:56] things where we look at it and say I
[1:34:58] just want rid of this right
[1:35:01] now but it's good that we've come to a
[1:35:04] place to say I'm not going to live with
[1:35:06] this malice any longer I'm not going to
[1:35:09] live with this bitterness any longer I'm
[1:35:11] not going to live with this any longer I
[1:35:13] have a right but as a sheep I forfeit my
[1:35:17] rights because I value his presence more
[1:35:22] than my personal
[1:35:25] rights because my own value my personal
[1:35:29] rights that's me that self that Grieves
[1:35:32] the spirit of God away from my
[1:35:36] life sometimes that journey is so great
[1:35:39] that we have to go
[1:35:41] on listen to
[1:35:44] me just because it's 20 or 25 miles does
[1:35:49] not mean there's nothing taking place
[1:35:56] God will lead you sometimes he'll lead
[1:35:58] us he'll lead us sometimes one service
[1:36:02] yeah that'll lead us to another service
[1:36:05] and if we really Trace right back and
[1:36:06] figure out when was it that God began to
[1:36:09] lead me in this
[1:36:12] renewal it might have been months ago
[1:36:16] that's right that's good it might have
[1:36:18] been months ago you see that's why when
[1:36:20] God begins to lead you through those
[1:36:22] places that let me tell you their places
[1:36:24] that for you and I to walk on our own
[1:36:26] they would be fearful this is why God
[1:36:29] reminds Joshua multiple times in chapter
[1:36:33] one don't be afraid yeah don't be
[1:36:36] dismayed that's good don't fear right
[1:36:40] all of those words describe fear and the
[1:36:42] effects of it on your life and even when
[1:36:44] they would come to certain places in the
[1:36:46] land God would remind them again I
[1:36:47] believe it's in Joshua chapter 20 he
[1:36:49] would speak to Joshua be not afraid of
[1:36:51] them you see why God sees God sees this
[1:36:54] is why God's not looking down and saying
[1:36:56] oh you're afraid his presence is here to
[1:36:59] accompany us and as Sons and Daughters
[1:37:01] of God we want to be Led Led Led Led
[1:37:04] it's not God saying here go do this on
[1:37:06] your own no but he said I will be in you
[1:37:10] right I will be your father you shall be
[1:37:14] my sons and daughters I will
[1:37:17] walk in
[1:37:19] you you're not approaching this alone
[1:37:24] these things that have happened in your
[1:37:26] life the
[1:37:27] scars things that that you look at and
[1:37:30] say God I want to closer walk with you
[1:37:32] and God is saying and I want to be
[1:37:34] closer to you I want more of my life to
[1:37:36] be expressed through you let's deal with
[1:37:39] this part in The Inheritance Hallelujah
[1:37:42] let's go with this in your life that's
[1:37:45] right Hallelujah that's so good and it
[1:37:47] isn't that God will altogether strip it
[1:37:51] out of our life it's that he just brings
[1:37:54] you to a place to where you can
[1:37:57] recognize greater is he that is in you
[1:38:01] that's right than he that's in the world
[1:38:03] that's right and where you recognize the
[1:38:05] real the Redeeming Grace of God and the
[1:38:08] effects of it even in that area of your
[1:38:10] life you know what that does I'll tell
[1:38:13] you what that does that creates and
[1:38:15] causes a yielded
[1:38:19] vessel and that's what it's all about is
[1:38:21] US yielding to the Lord
[1:38:25] God called him to
[1:38:27] this sometimes in our
[1:38:30] Spirits when a Spirits gone astray we
[1:38:32] can get
[1:38:34] stale we can become
[1:38:40] complacent the prophet would say it like
[1:38:42] this in one place on renewal just listen
[1:38:44] to what he says he says how many he says
[1:38:47] in here would like to have an experience
[1:38:49] that you once had a renewing in the Holy
[1:38:52] Ghost I
[1:38:54] do I don't just want one I need
[1:38:57] one I need one I want
[1:39:01] one brother Ram says would you just say
[1:39:05] this God take me back I don't care what
[1:39:07] it cost I don't care what the cost is I
[1:39:10] I don't want no more to flirt with the
[1:39:12] world I want to be real if the church
[1:39:14] would only go on as God as it should go
[1:39:17] there won't be any cripples and
[1:39:18] afflictions among us we've got to
[1:39:20] confess our sins he said you say brother
[1:39:23] samel or brother brandham our sins I
[1:39:25] don't have nothing to confess I ain't
[1:39:27] done nothing wrong I don't drink out he
[1:39:29] said it's not that it's neglection
[1:39:33] sometimes it's not moving up with God
[1:39:37] it's not doing things in the holy spirit
[1:39:39] it's not watering what God has given you
[1:39:43] and you're grieving it away brother BR
[1:39:46] said there was a woman who come to me
[1:39:47] brother Bram I'm so sick I have no more
[1:39:49] power with prayer the life of prayer is
[1:39:52] gone from me I'm getting older and I
[1:39:54] don't want to go like this brother Ram
[1:39:56] said see don't grieve the spirit of God
[1:39:58] away from you invite him back you said
[1:40:01] Brother s how do I invite him back
[1:40:03] brother B said he's only flown up there
[1:40:05] on that little
[1:40:08] branch in other words he didn't fly away
[1:40:12] and say forget
[1:40:16] you even though he would have a right
[1:40:18] for what how did we what we've
[1:40:21] entertained but he just because you know
[1:40:24] why when you've been sealed with the
[1:40:26] spirit of God and I'm trying to bring
[1:40:28] this to for for each one in here and
[1:40:31] even lives that are in Journey and in
[1:40:34] process to understand he's not gone very
[1:40:38] far you say what must I do the prophet
[1:40:41] said become a lamb
[1:40:46] again become a lamb again you see where
[1:40:48] does that start it starts first in your
[1:40:51] mind where the and meet you go back in
[1:40:56] your mind to what you were amen and if
[1:40:59] you go back in your mind and repent the
[1:41:02] prophet said the spirit of God will take
[1:41:05] you back to where you
[1:41:10] were a
[1:41:13] renewal incredible because we when we
[1:41:16] look at this of renewal I've I've
[1:41:17] pondered this I just I Ponder these
[1:41:21] things I say God what are you what are
[1:41:23] you what are you showing us on
[1:41:25] this
[1:41:29] because the battle in
[1:41:32] AI they had removed Sin from the camp
[1:41:35] right they went in according to God's
[1:41:37] program and they defeated AI right now
[1:41:42] if we're not careful sometimes we just
[1:41:46] go on and we judgment comes and and we
[1:41:50] repent and then we go forward but there
[1:41:53] should be a moment in our lives to where
[1:41:56] we reflect and
[1:41:58] say okay that Fellowship has been
[1:42:02] restored now in
[1:42:04] Fellowship what caused me to get off
[1:42:06] track
[1:42:08] right you see that's as a son and
[1:42:11] daughter of God I don't think any one of
[1:42:13] us in
[1:42:15] here want to make the same mistakes this
[1:42:18] year we made last
[1:42:21] year I thank God for for
[1:42:25] forgiveness but I don't I think we want
[1:42:27] to say Lord I want to see growth in my
[1:42:30] life I want to see growth in my life for
[1:42:33] things
[1:42:34] maybe if if if you're someone or one or
[1:42:37] one something that
[1:42:39] we grudges and offenses it's got to come
[1:42:42] to a point when you see listen let me
[1:42:43] just tell you it's God when things begin
[1:42:45] to stand out to you and you begin to see
[1:42:47] it as God is showing you you know you
[1:42:49] can't see it unless God helps you see it
[1:42:52] you can't you
[1:42:53] can't you can't at all it takes God to
[1:42:58] show
[1:43:01] that that's why even many times as a
[1:43:03] pastor I let you in on the Insight
[1:43:05] there's many times where I can watch and
[1:43:06] I'll see things and I just keep praying
[1:43:08] because I realize it's got to come to a
[1:43:09] place of a showdown to where that part
[1:43:12] is
[1:43:13] broken cuz if not it's veiled and it
[1:43:17] can't be received and it only creates
[1:43:20] attention yes it does that's why why it
[1:43:23] takes God this is why that's why you
[1:43:25] understand that and this is maybe this
[1:43:28] is a little bit more than what you need
[1:43:29] to know but you understand that with
[1:43:30] pastoring itself it's not evangelizing
[1:43:32] right that's good it's laboring with the
[1:43:36] flock a pastor is not a prophet God does
[1:43:39] not require a pastor to be a prophet to
[1:43:41] see into your life and to see this
[1:43:42] there's ways that God has to deal with
[1:43:44] me that's true God deals with me in a
[1:43:48] way that he might he might not deal with
[1:43:49] anybody else but God has the way that he
[1:43:51] deals with me in certain ways but the
[1:43:53] point is the laboring but see if we're
[1:43:55] not careful see here we are under a
[1:43:57] prophetic
[1:43:58] message and many times we
[1:44:01] want the
[1:44:03] results we see right there on deep call
[1:44:05] to the
[1:44:06] Deep we we want we want an Evangelistic
[1:44:10] service and so that becomes what we're
[1:44:13] I've got to have that yeah let me tell
[1:44:15] you what's necessary that's good you've
[1:44:17] got to have the word to sustain Victory
[1:44:22] amen
[1:44:24] the word builds you remember what the
[1:44:26] prophet tells us in in adoption series
[1:44:28] evangelism catches the cner teaching
[1:44:31] positions
[1:44:33] them is that
[1:44:35] true all of the parts are needed but God
[1:44:38] laboring with our lives and our hearts
[1:44:40] because in these areas in our life David
[1:44:44] in his own
[1:44:46] life he had a
[1:44:48] situation that arose in his life
[1:44:53] it goes out a walk on a
[1:44:57] balcony and there she is baath Sheba up
[1:45:01] there taking a bath at that
[1:45:05] time and it caught his
[1:45:08] eye David in a weakened moment you know
[1:45:12] what the prophet told us he said if
[1:45:14] David as God spoke through Nathan if you
[1:45:17] would have only
[1:45:19] asked ask what you have need of
[1:45:24] are you hearing me now the prophet said
[1:45:27] David in message of Grace David he said
[1:45:30] he had everything else with the other
[1:45:33] wives he said he could have satisfied
[1:45:36] his passion yeah that
[1:45:45] way but in a weakened
[1:45:48] moment she forgot to pull the shades and
[1:45:51] so forth and so on
[1:45:55] but where the where the story comes to
[1:45:58] is
[1:46:02] David is going to keep on
[1:46:06] going but because David is a man after
[1:46:10] God's Own
[1:46:11] Heart God comes to deal with David's
[1:46:16] life so good let me just tell you
[1:46:20] something when David
[1:46:23] finally look where David's at David's in
[1:46:25] a place man when that when that story is
[1:46:28] told by
[1:46:30] Nathan David is ready to take the head
[1:46:34] off of that
[1:46:36] guy you see what happened God come in
[1:46:40] and he stirred up that gate of reasoning
[1:46:42] which is the Gate of judgment it's not
[1:46:44] the Judgment of the soul but it's the
[1:46:47] Judgment gate and God gets him into that
[1:46:50] place like Jesus did many times with the
[1:46:53] over gets him into that place and
[1:46:55] finally he gets in that place and he
[1:46:57] said that man shall
[1:47:00] die he does not know but the text of the
[1:47:03] service the quotes in the service
[1:47:06] everything has been ordained for that
[1:47:10] moment of the Gate of judgment that is
[1:47:13] so good why that we can be
[1:47:16] honest before God yes sir
[1:47:20] listen don't be dismissive and say well
[1:47:23] I don't have that in my life I don't
[1:47:25] have that's I'm not exclusively speaking
[1:47:28] of that act that David committed I'm
[1:47:31] speaking of things that even in our
[1:47:33] spirit when you've got
[1:47:35] angry when you've said things that you
[1:47:38] shouldn't have
[1:47:39] said that's in your
[1:47:45] spirit things that has been allowed to
[1:47:49] sometimes get bottled up in our
[1:47:51] spirit listen let me tell you something
[1:47:53] you've got to be very careful we we
[1:47:57] speak this we preach this because this
[1:47:59] is the scripture there ought to be the
[1:48:01] pass of the Holy Ghost Inside of us and
[1:48:04] our lives walking in such a place with
[1:48:06] that pass that we're able to give others
[1:48:08] a
[1:48:09] pass but let me just let me let me warn
[1:48:12] you let me warn you let me let me just
[1:48:14] express it to
[1:48:17] you when you're giving others a pass
[1:48:20] that comes from you having the strength
[1:48:22] from being in his presence if not it
[1:48:26] becomes things that you're ignoring and
[1:48:28] it's bottling up in
[1:48:30] you and it's only a moment and a time
[1:48:34] where the pressure is going to be let
[1:48:35] off in the wrong
[1:48:38] situation there is a place to let off
[1:48:41] the pressure where is this place in our
[1:48:44] Promised
[1:48:45] Land Cities of Refuge that's so places
[1:48:50] where we can let off the pressure in
[1:48:53] Christ
[1:48:56] right I think every one of us feel
[1:48:58] pressure feel we feel pressure now more
[1:49:01] than we we ever have it a't got less
[1:49:04] it's even more and then and then and I'm
[1:49:07] not just talking sometimes about the
[1:49:09] outward things God is working in our
[1:49:12] lives in our hearts because once the
[1:49:15] Holy Ghost has come by the seal it's
[1:49:18] time now for
[1:49:20] overcoming it's time to over come it's
[1:49:23] time to press forward in the
[1:49:27] battle it's time to move into areas in
[1:49:30] our
[1:49:36] life say God I want to follow you
[1:49:39] Lord I want to follow
[1:49:41] you I hope you understand this this is
[1:49:45] not I think I told you this last week or
[1:49:48] this I think this came out last week I
[1:49:50] don't want
[1:49:52] I don't want a man trying to figure me
[1:49:55] out right because a man can't figure me
[1:49:58] out listen I want you to understand
[1:50:00] that's not that's not negating sitting
[1:50:03] down in counsel With A god-given god-
[1:50:05] Gifted Man because that's not that man
[1:50:08] that gift is there for God to work
[1:50:10] through right that's
[1:50:13] right and sometimes once again sometimes
[1:50:16] in this hour we can say I'm not but
[1:50:18] sometimes this is where we're at in our
[1:50:20] lives and this is why sometimes we can
[1:50:22] remain in the same places where we are
[1:50:24] is because we're
[1:50:25] wanting a prophet and the prophet of the
[1:50:28] hour is the Holy
[1:50:30] Ghost but you got to remember these
[1:50:33] times of renewal it's a journey and the
[1:50:36] only way listen if the prophet of God
[1:50:40] was still
[1:50:42] needed God wouldn't have took him off
[1:50:44] the
[1:50:45] scene right you say brother Samuel I'm
[1:50:48] still here let me tell you the angel of
[1:50:51] the Lord whose message it is accompanies
[1:50:56] his message still he he's still here to
[1:51:00] see us all the way
[1:51:03] through he's still here to confirm his
[1:51:07] word and to bring us under the place
[1:51:09] that he's prepared for
[1:51:11] us but Samuel are you saying that this
[1:51:15] areas and parts and things in my life
[1:51:17] that it's going to be completely cut out
[1:51:20] and it'll never bother me anymore
[1:51:23] what I'm saying to you is that you come
[1:51:26] to a place of where you're reigning over
[1:51:29] it by recognizing your Redemption
[1:51:33] through the blood of the
[1:51:37] Lamb this
[1:51:40] renewal a moment of renewal why why
[1:51:42] wasn't it just going back through and
[1:51:44] just well hey praise God I've you know
[1:51:46] repentance has come and here's the
[1:51:47] victory but no I want to see where where
[1:51:50] where where where am I I going off at
[1:51:54] listen friends listen
[1:51:56] listen you're going to have a time of
[1:51:59] reflection you either have a time of
[1:52:01] reflection now or you'll have a time of
[1:52:03] reflection in the tribulation
[1:52:07] period that's so good you can this is
[1:52:10] not an hour to be passive
[1:52:14] am I I I don't say this to be harsh I
[1:52:17] say it because it's truth as it comes
[1:52:19] from my heart if there's a passiveness
[1:52:21] in your life ask God first of all Lord
[1:52:24] do I really have a real experience with
[1:52:29] you is the word of God everything or is
[1:52:33] this world what I can get from the
[1:52:35] world what I can obtain let me tell
[1:52:39] you when my body is changed Rome can
[1:52:43] have my house that's
[1:52:45] right they can have my cars there you go
[1:52:49] the pope can ride in my heated
[1:52:51] seats you'll probably need the air
[1:52:53] conditioned ones where he's
[1:52:57] going Hallelujah I'm just
[1:53:00] saying it's a time of
[1:53:03] reflection and listen we want to live
[1:53:06] this is why it's a moment and a times of
[1:53:09] renewal
[1:53:11] God I I don't want to miss it for
[1:53:14] anything in the world Amen I don't want
[1:53:16] to miss what your desire is to do in my
[1:53:19] life because there will not be any
[1:53:21] excuse
[1:53:23] efficient none well brother so and so
[1:53:26] sister so and so if this one hadn't did
[1:53:28] this if this one there will be no
[1:53:31] excuses it's between us and
[1:53:35] God
[1:53:36] Amen so many times the reason people
[1:53:39] make excuses well this one did this and
[1:53:41] this one said this let me tell you what
[1:53:43] that always boils down to you're not
[1:53:45] willing to die to
[1:53:48] yourself oh I'm not going to go down

[1:54:35] message that God has sent to me amen
[1:54:38] this message has given me life because
[1:54:40] this message is Christ
[1:54:49] amen as I heard a brother say here just
[1:54:52] the other day matter of fact just the
[1:54:53] other night I was I was up we hours of
[1:54:57] the morning and so even in last night
[1:55:00] and so I heard him R over and oh brother
[1:55:02] Andrew is preaching in Africa
[1:55:05] Glover and he made a statement on there
[1:55:09] I thought man it's powerful and he made
[1:55:12] a statement so that they would
[1:55:13] understand regarding the
[1:55:14] message he said when you call an Uber
[1:55:18] driver taxi yeah whatever we call it
[1:55:21] right you you don't call them and say
[1:55:23] let me check your tire pressure let me
[1:55:26] check the oil in there let me check the
[1:55:30] gasoline that's so good you've called
[1:55:33] for it you get in it and it takes you to
[1:55:35] your destination
[1:55:37] Hallelujah the message is the
[1:55:41] Uber the message is the taxi I'm not
[1:55:45] here checking the tires checking the oil
[1:55:49] I'm resting
[1:55:52] it will bring me to my
[1:55:55] destination it was sent by
[1:56:00] God just as Solomon sent the guards to
[1:56:05] get the
[1:56:07] shulamite The Song of Solomon God has
[1:56:09] sent this message
[1:56:11] hallelujah it's a message of himself a
[1:56:14] message of his
[1:56:15] grace to pick you and I up
[1:56:22] my statement on that I know it's nothing
[1:56:24] new here but just another angle I really
[1:56:26] enjoyed on
[1:56:27] it because I think that's foolishness
[1:56:30] trying to inspect the tires that's a
[1:56:32] trap let me inspect the windshield n no
[1:56:35] I called it I get in it right and when
[1:56:37] you get in you can see what it produces
[1:56:39] in arrest it's arrest isn't it it's
[1:56:41] arrest he he will bring me to that
[1:56:43] prepared Place
[1:56:45] amen but here's the
[1:56:47] prophet I appreciate how that he would
[1:56:50] take this in what was the whole Holy
[1:56:52] Ghost given
[1:56:54] for and he would speak about
[1:56:58] how that in his own
[1:57:02] life he
[1:57:04] says before they had come to that time
[1:57:07] where brother Bram preaches the Holy
[1:57:09] Ghost series and if you a student of the
[1:57:11] message and you go through you realize
[1:57:13] that brother brandham even coming back
[1:57:14] into the December of 1959 they've
[1:57:16] already called among the congregation at
[1:57:19] the Tabernacle a time of consecration
[1:57:22] and it was a time just just settling
[1:57:24] everything get everything out from
[1:57:25] between you between other people get get
[1:57:27] get your heart get everything right
[1:57:29] because there's a need for the holy
[1:57:32] ghost in the lives of the
[1:57:34] people and brother Brown just some
[1:57:36] powerful messages that are preached not
[1:57:38] only the Holy Ghost series but he goes
[1:57:40] into this place and for his own self he
[1:57:42] says here I am with my wife in our
[1:57:46] living room the other day our DIN and we
[1:57:48] joined Hands Across the DU folder like a
[1:57:52] hassk where you sit on it you know prop
[1:57:54] your feet up they joined
[1:57:57] hands and they
[1:58:00] said they made a commitment to God a
[1:58:03] rededicating of their lives and brother
[1:58:06] BR says I've been
[1:58:07] neglectful I've neglected calls I've
[1:58:11] neglected doing certain things he said I
[1:58:13] I could have went more and I didn't go
[1:58:17] more I appreciate that Honesty
[1:58:23] that to me is a man I can
[1:58:25] follow and brother BR I want you to
[1:58:28] watch where the neglect has come from
[1:58:31] see neglect itself is only an expression
[1:58:35] of something else that's going on he
[1:58:39] says oh he
[1:58:41] says I want to stand like Moses I want
[1:58:43] to stand like
[1:58:45] Joshua I want to stand there and he says
[1:58:48] I took my wife by the hand and I crossed
[1:58:51] this Bible in her little Bible and I
[1:58:53] said honey I've been too negative the
[1:58:57] Holy Spirit condemns me within
[1:59:02] me being negative has called
[1:59:07] neglect what was brother Bram negative
[1:59:10] about he's talking about a things that
[1:59:12] he was seeing listen we are surrounded
[1:59:15] beginning right here with
[1:59:17] negative we run face to face day in and
[1:59:21] day out
[1:59:22] with
[1:59:25] negative but it just goes to show us
[1:59:28] when God calls for a time of
[1:59:30] renewal God will direct us right to the
[1:59:34] place of what's going
[1:59:36] on and he'll speak into the depths of
[1:59:39] Our Lives that we might be able to
[1:59:44] confess what is there that is so good do
[1:59:48] do you see that it wasn't that it just
[1:59:51] we're going to have a new consecration
[1:59:53] but as he was consecrating himself
[1:59:54] notice this come from just consecrating
[1:59:57] brother Brian he just was days brother
[1:59:58] Brian was consecrating himself praying
[2:00:00] he said I was praying for hours and just
[2:00:02] just seeking the Lord and finally it
[2:00:04] come to a place where God showed him
[2:00:08] you've been too
[2:00:10] negative and it's caused
[2:00:14] neglect see how can negative negative of
[2:00:17] just looking all around can cause
[2:00:19] neglect between husband and wife life
[2:00:22] can cause neglect in a body can cause
[2:00:26] neglect and is not even maybe negative
[2:00:29] with that person but sometimes just the
[2:00:31] encompassing of negative you say how do
[2:00:33] I stop that well there's times of
[2:00:38] renewal but through times of renewal
[2:00:41] remember the renewal is by the word yes
[2:00:45] to the
[2:00:46] word and it's every part of our life
[2:00:50] being reconciled to God
[2:00:53] because if my soul has been sealed my
[2:00:55] soul is already reconciled to God but
[2:00:59] it's my
[2:01:00] spirit my heart if there's something
[2:01:03] that's unconfessed it may not be
[2:01:05] unconfessed sin it might be just
[2:01:08] something that we've not come to the
[2:01:10] point and the depth of right now to be
[2:01:13] able to put our finger on it but let me
[2:01:15] just say this would you be willing to
[2:01:17] say Lord I put my hand in your hand Lead
[2:01:21] Me Lord Jesus guide me Lord God work in
[2:01:25] my life help me Lord I pray in every
[2:01:27] channel I want a
[2:01:30] renewing that is by the spirit of God
[2:01:33] one that moves to repair my spirit and
[2:01:37] my life amen everybody
[2:01:43] okay there was a division in the Kingdom
[2:01:45] of
[2:01:46] Israel sometimes divisions
[2:01:49] come when Saul when they wanted a king
[2:01:53] remember there was some there that said
[2:01:55] who is this
[2:01:57] guy isn't it amazing how when there was
[2:02:02] wickedness God would call wickedness
[2:02:04] sometimes that which was a thought
[2:02:08] against his character or his word he
[2:02:09] would call it belile belile and yet it
[2:02:13] would be sons of Israel right but he's
[2:02:16] calling their
[2:02:18] action be yeah
[2:02:22] remember when David went out to battle
[2:02:23] to reclaim what was in Zig remember that
[2:02:26] and there were individuals that were too
[2:02:28] faint to go up to zigg they were
[2:02:32] weary they were overcome in their spirit
[2:02:35] and David said wait right here by the by
[2:02:37] the Brook
[2:02:38] bore the rest of us will
[2:02:41] go and they went and according to what
[2:02:44] God said they took everything all they
[2:02:47] recovered and brought it back and those
[2:02:50] that was with David
[2:02:52] and with him in that Victory spoke up
[2:02:56] and said we shall not give spoils to
[2:02:59] those who waited by the Brook because
[2:03:01] they were faint and David said hold your
[2:03:04] tongue right thou of be they were sons
[2:03:09] of Israel yes but their behavior was not
[2:03:13] the behavior of the character that God
[2:03:16] had chosen for him that's that's good
[2:03:19] you see how it's things sometimes were
[2:03:21] Even in our feelings and the way that
[2:03:23] we're walking and we you know Satan can
[2:03:25] get in there and want to bring
[2:03:28] division why aren the rest doing this
[2:03:30] and why aren't this doing this and Satan
[2:03:32] trying to bring a division where at in
[2:03:35] your
[2:03:37] spirit because if there's one division
[2:03:39] in the
[2:03:40] ranks will not stand
[2:03:43] Victorious That Should Be Our intention
[2:03:46] my intention is not to line up you or
[2:03:49] you or you or you but to preach away
[2:03:52] that lines us
[2:03:53] up it's up to us as individuals to take
[2:03:57] that word and line our lives with that
[2:04:00] word and apply it amen and not say well
[2:04:03] I'm on my own little island I'm going to
[2:04:05] do my own little thing you are a part of
[2:04:07] a
[2:04:09] body amen and I just encourage you if
[2:04:12] you have forgot that right there begin
[2:04:14] on that right there what has caused me
[2:04:17] to be removed in that area that I'm part
[2:04:19] of a body because I will dare say
[2:04:22] you'll find you have done the same thing
[2:04:24] in your natural
[2:04:26] families wow you've done it in work
[2:04:29] relationships come on friends don't
[2:04:31] don't try to we've got to be honest
[2:04:32] right now we've got to be
[2:04:34] honest what is it that's going on in
[2:04:36] there that's causing
[2:04:42] this but I know
[2:04:44] sometimes sometimes what our flesh
[2:04:48] wants we want instant potatoes right one
[2:04:52] this is going on oh Lord oh my brother
[2:04:55] Trevor's coming praise God when's
[2:04:56] brother codre going to get here oh if
[2:04:58] they would only have brother Ron Spencer
[2:05:00] oh if they would only have
[2:05:05] somebody exactly he's
[2:05:09] here the one that we need is
[2:05:13] here and it wouldn't matter if you had
[2:05:16] 100 run Spencers lined up if there's no
[2:05:19] sincerity in the bottom of it it'll come
[2:05:22] back
[2:05:23] am it's not the man that has the power
[2:05:27] and the authority
[2:05:30] Hallelujah you understand now you stop
[2:05:33] looking at men as idols and recognize
[2:05:35] you have the authority has a son and
[2:05:38] daughter of God he said in Deuteronomy
[2:05:40] 11 if you will put the word first stay
[2:05:45] with thus sayith the Lord not a man
[2:05:47] shall be able to stand before you amen
[2:05:50] you know it brings it down individual
[2:05:51] level where we're not looking to some
[2:05:53] man putting some man as some hero and
[2:05:55] putting up there oh if I only had this
[2:05:57] man to lay hands on me if I only had
[2:05:59] this man but it's recognizing who it is
[2:06:02] that's in our midst and who is in
[2:06:06] you if that's one thing that the message
[2:06:09] of the hour did it
[2:06:10] broke that Pentecostalism where it was
[2:06:13] chasing after
[2:06:15] men and it's breaking it yet
[2:06:17] still and to recognize recognize you
[2:06:20] know why because without that being
[2:06:22] recognized we're still dependent upon
[2:06:26] flesh and the Bible tells us in the book
[2:06:29] of his Isaiah cease ye from man whose
[2:06:32] breath is in his nostrils it isn't that
[2:06:35] we don't need the preaching God uses men
[2:06:37] but he uses men to preach through he'll
[2:06:39] use men to minister to you he'll come
[2:06:42] down as a mighty counselor and counsel
[2:06:44] through he'll come down through hands
[2:06:45] that are being laid on but it's all God
[2:06:50] yes amen
[2:06:53] that's why we need a renewal God have I
[2:06:56] got so fixed to where I'm fixed on
[2:06:59] personalities instead of recognizing
[2:07:03] you I'm ready to go welcome a
[2:07:05] personality instead of washing your
[2:07:09] feet chasing after this and but I need a
[2:07:13] renewal back to the word of God see this
[2:07:17] is where it gets real friends this is
[2:07:19] where it gets real this is where it gets
[2:07:22] down to a place and many times this is a
[2:07:24] place when it starts getting down face
[2:07:27] to face in people's lives it's where
[2:07:29] sometimes they've got a choice on what
[2:07:30] they're going to do you're either going
[2:07:33] to go on with God and face the issue or
[2:07:37] you start pulling
[2:07:39] back start pulling
[2:07:41] back if you're not careful you'll chase
[2:07:45] the next
[2:07:49] move you don't want your spirit
[2:07:54] fed the Holy Ghost does not feed on
[2:07:59] emotion come on you know where I'm at
[2:08:02] false anointed ones at the end time the
[2:08:04] Holy Ghost does not feed on emotion it
[2:08:06] feeds on the word of God the word of God
[2:08:09] and his presence it can bring emotion
[2:08:11] but emotion never produces
[2:08:15] Victory never it never produces lasting
[2:08:19] Victory that's why you'll never hear it
[2:08:21] said from this preacher you got to get
[2:08:23] your shout back you don't got to get
[2:08:24] your shout back you need to get back to
[2:08:26] God then you get your shout back there
[2:08:28] you go that's right there's a right
[2:08:32] order right order to
[2:08:35] everything my goodness where is time
[2:08:39] going here's Israel some of you are
[2:08:41] looking at your watch wow I didn't even
[2:08:43] realize others of you have been having
[2:08:44] me on a timer the whole time you need a
[2:08:46] renewal you need a renewal come you can
[2:08:49] sit and watch garbage on a TV
[2:08:52] for hours on
[2:08:54] end you can sit and look at your phone
[2:08:57] for how long and then can't set in the
[2:09:00] house of God
[2:09:01] [Music]
[2:09:03] hallelujah you need a
[2:09:07] renewal
[2:09:10] hallelujah look at look at Instagram and
[2:09:13] Facebook and everything else all the
[2:09:14] time you need a renewal Facebook
[2:09:18] Instagram or SnapChat Tik Tok whatever
[2:09:21] it is it'll never bring you renewal
[2:09:26] amen but it's the word of God and
[2:09:29] there's a way back it's a way back it's
[2:09:31] called
[2:09:32] repentance when Israel had that great
[2:09:35] separation of Camp as I
[2:09:37] said yes Saul was crowned King
[2:09:40] yes but after the victory the first
[2:09:42] Victory Was Won Samuel was led by God
[2:09:45] call the people to
[2:09:47] gilgal to
[2:09:49] repair the kingdom
[2:09:52] I think it's 1st Samuel 21 call him back
[2:09:54] to repair means renew come back where's
[2:09:57] gigal gilo is where circumcision took
[2:09:59] place call them back to the place where
[2:10:03] the tie of Egypt was broken amen but
[2:10:07] they but they made a decision for Saul
[2:10:09] I'm trying to close here on this but
[2:10:12] they've already made that decision but
[2:10:14] just because Israel made a wrong
[2:10:18] decision and a fleshly decision God
[2:10:22] didn't abandon
[2:10:25] them as a matter of fact Samuel said I
[2:10:29] will pray for you God forbid that I stop
[2:10:33] praying for you and sin against God
[2:10:38] hallelujah
[2:10:41] yes so
[2:10:44] good but how much are we willing to
[2:10:48] Journey amen are we willing to take
[2:10:50] those Journeys
[2:10:52] are we willing to say Lord search
[2:10:55] me what is it that's I know you forgiven
[2:10:59] me but what's what caused me to get off
[2:11:03] path help me Lord
[2:11:06] I I don't even know how to describe
[2:11:08] certain ways the way that I am remember
[2:11:10] brother Bram said he had certain ways
[2:11:11] the way he was but he also learned
[2:11:15] how to subdue those things it didn't
[2:11:19] mean that they didn't come up
[2:11:24] David said create in
[2:11:25] me a clean
[2:11:29] heart and
[2:11:31] renew a right spirit in
[2:11:34] me and do what
[2:11:38] restore unto me the
[2:11:41] joy of thy
[2:11:44] salvation David never
[2:11:46] lost his
[2:11:49] salvation he lost the joy
[2:11:51] joy that accompanied
[2:11:54] it what was it that stopped
[2:11:58] it is when sin
[2:12:01] entered his Spirit went
[2:12:04] astray his eye caught it from the eye it
[2:12:09] suggested into the reasoning went
[2:12:11] through the imaginations searched back
[2:12:14] to the memories it keeps on going keeps
[2:12:16] on
[2:12:17] going see David that renewal
[2:12:22] he knew exactly what to do when the word
[2:12:24] was leading him to that place create in
[2:12:27] me a clean
[2:12:29] hearten renew a right Spirit In Me Lord
[2:12:33] wherever I've went
[2:12:35] off Lead Me Lord show
[2:12:39] me you know what that would be like that
[2:12:42] would be like let's say whether it's a
[2:12:43] brother a sister whatever something some
[2:12:45] area that you would struggle in maybe
[2:12:47] it's a besetting sin and you look at and
[2:12:50] say finally Lord show
[2:12:53] me teach me where is what is it there
[2:12:58] where's the weakness at because there's
[2:13:00] no weakness in you the weakness is in
[2:13:05] me show me Lord show me where it's at
[2:13:10] that's what as Sons and Daughters of God
[2:13:12] that's what we're called to friends in
[2:13:13] this
[2:13:16] hour you're Lov him
[2:13:21] let me close on this
[2:13:27] quote
[2:13:29] remember it's God who calls for a
[2:13:33] renewal not
[2:13:35] us it's
[2:13:39] God and to have that
[2:13:44] discernment that's needed
[2:13:47] honesty and the
[2:13:49] humility brother says in recognizing
[2:13:52] your day and its message
[2:13:54] God create in
[2:13:57] me a
[2:13:59] Revival notice how David wrote that
[2:14:01] create in me he knew Lord I I cannot of
[2:14:05] my own self do this but create in me
[2:14:09] what's
[2:14:11] needed how many of you ever read Psalms
[2:14:13] 51
[2:14:14] before okay about five of you
[2:14:18] four but Psalms 51
[2:14:23] what's very important is after David
[2:14:24] writes this is some of the very last
[2:14:27] scriptures he says build thou up the
[2:14:31] walls of Jerusalem oh
[2:14:34] Lord that are torn
[2:14:36] down there was no walls torn down in the
[2:14:39] natural
[2:14:41] Jerusalem it was this
[2:14:44] Jerusalem the walls have been
[2:14:49] compromised God build up the walls amen
[2:14:53] build up the walls of my life Lord where
[2:14:56] if there's something that's come into
[2:14:58] your life something that's entered in
[2:15:00] listen don't don't just get it to where
[2:15:02] it's just a certain area
[2:15:04] anything that is hindering you and where
[2:15:08] the joy of the Lord is not permeating in
[2:15:10] your life like it ought to
[2:15:13] be if your joy and your Delight is other
[2:15:16] things of the world if you look forward
[2:15:18] more to that than you do coming to the
[2:15:20] house House of God getting in his
[2:15:22] presence in prayer you need a renewal
[2:15:25] friends I'm not upset with you I'm here
[2:15:27] to encourage you this is a moment of
[2:15:29] renewal right a moment a time that God
[2:15:33] would call us to and you know what he'll
[2:15:35] continue until the Rapture at different
[2:15:37] times calling us to times of
[2:15:41] renewal God create in me a
[2:15:45] Revival let me be the Revival Let each
[2:15:50] of us be the Revival the Revival in me
[2:15:54] make me Lord to
[2:15:58] hunger make me to thirst how many could
[2:16:03] say yes Lord I'll be honest enough right
[2:16:05] there Lord make me to hunger more make
[2:16:08] me to thirst more
[2:16:10] Lord create in me Lord that what is
[2:16:13] needed in me let me from this hour on be
[2:16:18] thine more consecrated service
[2:16:21] a better
[2:16:23] servant more blessed of you more able
[2:16:28] more
[2:16:28] humbler more
[2:16:31] Kinder more willing to
[2:16:33] work more looking to the things that are
[2:16:39] positive and
[2:16:41] forgetting the things that are in the
[2:16:44] past and the
[2:16:47] negatives let me press towards the mar
[2:16:51] Mark of the High Calling of
[2:16:58] Christ no one
[2:17:00] ever cared for
[2:17:02] me like
[2:17:05] Jesus that is so good no
[2:17:09] one no one there's not a doctor there's
[2:17:13] not a
[2:17:14] psychologist and I believe like the
[2:17:16] prophet tells us with doctors he said
[2:17:18] they're God's agents
[2:17:21] so I'm not I'm not I'm not Downing
[2:17:23] doctors you you'll not find that from me
[2:17:26] you'll not even find me dashing
[2:17:27] psychologist or psychist I I don't do
[2:17:29] that because the prophet said anything
[2:17:31] that helps right direct quote anything
[2:17:34] that helps but sometimes we we have this
[2:17:37] place I don't believe in their outcomes
[2:17:40] I don't believe in their
[2:17:42] outcomes but a lot of times there's
[2:17:44] certain things sometimes there's certain
[2:17:45] principles that can be worked by that
[2:17:47] are Godly
[2:17:49] principles but there is is a direct
[2:17:51] outcome that we know that the only thing
[2:17:53] that can take place is a renewing of the
[2:17:56] Holy Spirit true to where that God can
[2:17:59] go down into a life that
[2:18:01] maybe has been rejected all their
[2:18:05] life they have been rejected they have
[2:18:08] felt
[2:18:09] rejected maybe from a a parent maybe
[2:18:12] from a grandparent maybe they were
[2:18:14] looked at as the
[2:18:15] Oddball within that family maybe because
[2:18:19] certain features were different
[2:18:21] complexities and everything else and yet
[2:18:24] maybe sometimes it wasn't even things
[2:18:25] that was said in a certain way you say
[2:18:28] brother Samuel you mean to tell me that
[2:18:30] things like that can still exist the
[2:18:33] Holy Ghost is the Seal of your
[2:18:37] soul man once the seal has come to your
[2:18:41] soul then God will give you the strength
[2:18:43] to let you
[2:18:45] know you're not
[2:18:47] rejected you might have been rejected by
[2:18:50] family you might have been rejected by
[2:18:52] them but through his grace ministering
[2:18:56] healing in that area of our life not
[2:18:59] only will we be able to forgive them and
[2:19:02] the bitterness cleaned out of our life
[2:19:05] that's
[2:19:07] right because we can't have one Speck of
[2:19:10] bitterness even if we're
[2:19:12] justified in having
[2:19:16] it bitterness will run him away from you
[2:19:20] said brother Samuel that that's that's
[2:19:22] humanly impossible I know it I know it I
[2:19:25] know
[2:19:26] it but With God all things are
[2:19:31] possible how many Believers here this
[2:19:33] morning amen the prophet would turn that
[2:19:35] same scripture back around and he says
[2:19:37] if you're a Believer then all things are
[2:19:40] possible with you that is so good see
[2:19:44] it's recognizing what you've got in your
[2:19:46] hand yeah it's recognizing that you
[2:19:49] don't need some big super duper it's
[2:19:50] faith faith faith faith faith faith
[2:19:56] simple
[2:20:00] faith I think what a fitting statement
[2:20:04] brother brand would make
[2:20:08] this brother Bram how can a
[2:20:11] Christian get deeper in the love of
[2:20:14] God how many of you want to get deeper
[2:20:16] in the love of
[2:20:18] God simple statement
[2:20:23] read the
[2:20:24] word and
[2:20:29] pray see how do I know if I'm getting
[2:20:31] deeper because I could be reading the
[2:20:33] word and I could be praying it's
[2:20:36] true but when you open the Bible I've
[2:20:40] got to read this right here brother Sam
[2:20:42] you told me you was down you were done
[2:20:43] before Oh if you listen to this it will
[2:20:45] help you come on now it'll help you
[2:20:50] a brother said brother brandham oh I
[2:20:52] want to see a vision would you pray that
[2:20:54] God will let me see a vision listen
[2:20:57] brother Bram says my beloved brother
[2:21:00] every time you open the Bible you see a
[2:21:04] vision God revealing himself here is
[2:21:09] God's Vision go
[2:21:14] hallah hallu now watch what he says just
[2:21:18] open it up and
[2:21:22] say so you see how intentional it is of
[2:21:25] a morning maybe it's after you get in
[2:21:27] from work whenever you open it and say
[2:21:29] God God open my eyes that I can see
[2:21:33] you because you are the word open my
[2:21:37] eyes that I can see you
[2:21:39] Hallelujah you realize this is Your Love
[2:21:42] Letter am this is our love letter this
[2:21:46] is where our identity has come from our
[2:21:48] identity has not come from church amen
[2:21:52] come on
[2:21:53] Friends your identity is not with a
[2:21:57] Doctrine or a movement your
[2:22:00] identity is in Christ the word
[2:22:05] hallelujah that's right Lord thank you
[2:22:09] Jesus read the word amen and
[2:22:14] pray and as we open in that way and that
[2:22:18] just that just in that simple way is
[2:22:20] even as we're continuing to give our
[2:22:22] lives to the Lord being faithful in the
[2:22:26] house of God you know you don't know
[2:22:28] what you're going to miss like brother
[2:22:29] Timothy was here last night or last
[2:22:32] night Thursday night what if Zacharias
[2:22:35] hadn't went to church that day yeah
[2:22:37] there you go right it wouldn't have been
[2:22:40] the same stream at home right what about
[2:22:43] the wise
[2:22:45] men whether they owned those camels or
[2:22:47] rented them it still was a costly
[2:22:48] Journey yes sir they they journeyed that
[2:22:51] many years for one
[2:22:55] service Hallelujah one service that's
[2:22:58] right Hallelujah one
[2:23:00] service how do you know how do you know
[2:23:03] that the journey that God has started us
[2:23:07] on stay
[2:23:09] faithful stay
[2:23:11] faithful it might be 20 to 25 miles to
[2:23:16] ebal and mount
[2:23:19] gersam but oh
[2:23:21] oh it's worth the journey yes it is
[2:23:24] because when you get there you'll see
[2:23:27] where the
[2:23:28] curse has already been dealt with that's
[2:23:31] so good and in the midst of that time as
[2:23:34] they would describe it it was like a
[2:23:36] natural Amphitheater that was there
[2:23:38] where the sound could be heard you'll
[2:23:40] hear the blessings of God moving upon
[2:23:43] your life don't you
[2:23:49] loving the tell me how do I know the
[2:23:51] effect watch watch watch watch watch
[2:23:53] what the word
[2:23:56] does if we're lining up with the word in
[2:23:59] the right way really the only way there
[2:24:01] is it'll cause us to line up with one
[2:24:05] another you see that's why unity and
[2:24:08] Harmony is not trying to line people up
[2:24:11] right it's get us lined up with the word
[2:24:14] when we get lined up with the
[2:24:16] word then that right there it has that
[2:24:18] effect it's like brother Bram says they
[2:24:19] inject it kidney cell into the body he
[2:24:22] said how does that kidney cell know to
[2:24:23] go to the
[2:24:24] kidneys that's right the church age book
[2:24:27] he said how does it know where to go it
[2:24:28] say the same way to every son and
[2:24:30] daughter of God when you've come into
[2:24:31] the body of Christ The Same Spirit of
[2:24:33] God knows how to direct you if you're a
[2:24:34] kidney if you're part of the heart if
[2:24:36] you're part of this part of the promised
[2:24:38] land that knows exactly where to direct
[2:24:40] us where we need to
[2:24:41] be
[2:24:43] my let's pray
[2:24:57] I wonder how many even here this morning
[2:25:00] as
[2:25:01] we just approach the Lord in prayer and
[2:25:04] I think about as I know we've already
[2:25:05] started a new year
[2:25:07] and brother Brown would have many times
[2:25:10] many things to
[2:25:11] say in regards to a new
[2:25:14] year but we know we're not people of
[2:25:18] just turning Pages or turning
[2:25:23] leaves but we're
[2:25:26] people lives that God has changed
[2:25:30] transformed by his
[2:25:35] presence and if you have an experience
[2:25:37] to that depth this morning he he wants
[2:25:40] to do that for
[2:25:44] you maybe maybe he has done that for you
[2:25:46] and you can you know that there's that
[2:25:49] rest that's there
[2:25:52] but yet now the spirit of God
[2:25:55] would begin to help us to
[2:25:59] see there's
[2:26:01] certain things you need to take and tear
[2:26:04] down out of your
[2:26:05] [Music]
[2:26:07] life the Lord would tell them in
[2:26:09] Deuteronomy giving them instructions
[2:26:12] before they would enter in the
[2:26:15] land he told them to remove the pictures
[2:26:21] that was representative of the land get
[2:26:24] rid of their
[2:26:25] Groves get rid of their
[2:26:28] Idols get rid of all those things
[2:26:31] pictures and everything lest it become a
[2:26:34] snare unto
[2:26:37] you don't look at something and say well
[2:26:40] that don't bother me no more remember
[2:26:44] remember the little sister named
[2:26:47] Nelly that the prophet talks about in
[2:26:50] great greatest battle ever
[2:26:52] fought she was on the other side of the
[2:26:54] street of the dance hall and begin
[2:26:57] to she heard that music and she thought
[2:27:01] well that don't bother me no
[2:27:03] more brother brm says oh that's just
[2:27:05] what you
[2:27:10] think she began to then entertain
[2:27:14] thoughts reminiscing of how that her and
[2:27:16] a man named
[2:27:18] Lee won so many
[2:27:22] dancing
[2:27:25] competitions and just from stopping to
[2:27:33] listen she finds
[2:27:36] herself in the arms of a man on that
[2:27:40] dance
[2:27:43] floor now the prophet of God when he
[2:27:46] would teach that he would teach that and
[2:27:47] bring that out in greatest battle ever
[2:27:49] fought
[2:27:54] we don't want to look at things in a
[2:27:59] manner to where oh this doesn't bother
[2:28:01] me I'm I'm okay with this
[2:28:04] really let the Holy Spirit just evaluat
[2:28:07] your heart and your life right
[2:28:10] now and be honest remember a time of
[2:28:12] renewal is going to require
[2:28:16] discernment it's going to require
[2:28:18] honesty
[2:28:20] and it will require
[2:28:23] humility can you really be honest with
[2:28:26] God most importantly honest with
[2:28:31] yourself cuz if you can't be
[2:28:34] honest with yourself you'll never be
[2:28:36] honest to God he already
[2:28:40] knows he already
[2:28:42] [Music]
[2:28:46] knows I wonder here this morning say
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:28:53] Lord as you look back over your
[2:28:57] life I'm not the same person I was a
[2:29:01] year ago two years ago however maybe
[2:29:06] it's just a few months ago I don't
[2:29:08] know but right here in his presence oh
[2:29:11] what an opportunity what a
[2:29:14] privilege
[2:29:17] hallelujah what a privilege
[2:29:20] what a tender moment to say
[2:29:23] Lord I want to
[2:29:26] renew yes I want to
[2:29:30] renew renew my life Lord
[2:29:33] renew a real fresh
[2:29:38] consecration show me Lord
[2:29:41] where my spirit went off
[2:29:44] course what is it that I allowed to come
[2:29:47] into my
[2:29:49] spirit that would hinder me in that
[2:29:53] way I want to pull down that
[2:29:57] stronghold I want to do is Paul would
[2:30:00] speak to the Ephesian Believers in that
[2:30:02] time give no
[2:30:04] place to the
[2:30:08] devil lord
[2:30:12] Jesus help us
[2:30:16] Lord the prophet himself he would have
[2:30:20] never recognized what was going on in
[2:30:23] his own
[2:30:26] Spirit when that complex had
[2:30:29] formed he never would have caught
[2:30:33] [Music]
[2:30:35] it but
[2:30:37] you made him aware of it
[2:30:42] Lord it wasn't
[2:30:44] gone as soon as
[2:30:47] he recognized it
[2:30:52] but I want you to think of this the
[2:30:54] prophet stands before a group of
[2:30:57] graduates and come follow me before he
[2:30:59] makes his track back to
[2:31:02] Jeffersonville in June of
[2:31:06] 1963 he doesn't go into the whole story
[2:31:09] that he speaks of in standing in the Gap
[2:31:13] but he tells them I was headed down a
[2:31:16] wrong road
[2:31:20] but he stopped
[2:31:21] [Music]
[2:31:23] me and he could stand there among them
[2:31:26] graduates and say but I'm on a different
[2:31:29] road
[2:31:32] [Music]
[2:31:36] now Lord
[2:31:39] [Music]
[2:31:41] Jesus we need your grace
[2:31:44] [Music]
[2:31:48] Lord I wonder how he would say
[2:31:52] Lord I want to renew oh
[2:31:55] Lord want to put my
[2:31:57] hand in your hand
[2:32:00] Lord these are areas Lord I've not
[2:32:02] wanted to go
[2:32:04] into but I'm not going
[2:32:06] alone it's not a dark Cavern there's a
[2:32:10] man there's a man here who can turn on
[2:32:13] the
[2:32:14] [Music]
[2:32:16] light there's a man that knows what wir
[2:32:19] to Touch where in order to make it run
[2:32:23] [Music]
[2:32:25] right God bless you God bless
[2:32:28] you Lord search me out
