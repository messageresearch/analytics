[26:58] amen heavenly father we
[27:02] come to you lord tonight at this time of
[27:05] the service
[27:06] lord lord your presence has been here
[27:09] during the worship of your people dear
[27:11] god
[27:12] we can sense that presence god we ask
[27:16] now that you anoint
[27:17] your servant lord tonight you be able to
[27:20] come
[27:20] lord and speak the word through me lord
[27:23] to be a help to the people lord
[27:26] to be a strength in them an
[27:27] encouragement dear god to lift them up
[27:29] dear lord
[27:31] we ask these things lord in the name of
[27:33] the lord jesus christ
[27:35] and to the glory of god amen
[27:39] amen i'd like to read from second
[27:41] corinthians chapter 12
[27:43] tonight verses 7 through 10.
[27:53] what i'd like to speak on is when i am
[27:55] weak
[27:58] when i am weak
[28:02] verse 7 and lest i should be exalted
[28:04] above measure through the abundance of
[28:06] the revelation
[28:07] there is given to me a thorn in the
[28:09] flesh the messenger of satan to buffet
[28:11] me
[28:12] lest i should be exalted above measure
[28:15] for this thing
[28:16] i beside the lord thrice that it might
[28:18] depart from me
[28:20] but he said unto me my grace is
[28:22] sufficient for thee
[28:23] for my strength is made perfect in
[28:25] weakness
[28:26] most gladly therefore will i rather
[28:29] glory in my infirmities
[28:31] that the power of christ might rest upon
[28:33] me
[28:34] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[28:37] in a reproaches
[28:39] in necessities in persecutions
[28:42] in distresses for christ's sake
[28:45] for when i am weak then i am strong
[28:48] you may be seated
[28:53] the lord knows our strength he knows how
[28:55] feeble we are he knows how weak we are
[28:58] he knows that we're humans he knows he
[29:01] understands humanity he understands the
[29:03] flesh
[29:04] he understands how weak the flesh is
[29:07] and because he understands these things
[29:10] because he came
[29:11] and lived in this kind of flesh his
[29:14] flesh
[29:15] grew old they said when he was in his
[29:18] 30s he looked like he was about 50
[29:21] his flesh grew old it grew tired he grew
[29:24] hungry
[29:26] it had he had physical needs
[29:29] he had mental needs he had
[29:33] he experienced all these things so he
[29:36] knows how weak we
[29:37] are and we realize how strong he
[29:41] is that we can depend on him
[29:45] that in our weakest times we know that
[29:48] he will give us strength
[29:52] and we can look at
[29:55] many different characters in the bible
[29:57] and see when they were at their weakest
[30:00] and what god did for them in that time
[30:03] we can look at elijah
[30:05] remember elijah he looked pretty mighty
[30:08] when he was up there on
[30:09] mount carmel and he was challenging
[30:12] those
[30:13] priests of baal and he
[30:17] you know gave the sacrifice and
[30:20] filled it with water the trenches with
[30:22] water and called fire down out of heaven
[30:25] they consumed the sacrifice consumed the
[30:28] altar
[30:28] and licked the water out of the trenches
[30:31] and then he
[30:32] slayed the priests and then when he was
[30:35] done with that
[30:36] why he was weak
[30:40] the anointing he had come out from
[30:42] underneath that anointing
[30:44] and when he came out from underneath
[30:46] that anointing then what he had left was
[30:48] his flesh
[30:50] and it was weak from being from god
[30:53] using it
[30:54] the way he had and so when he was weak
[30:58] then god said
[30:59] come aside for a little while i've got
[31:02] some
[31:02] crows that's going to feed you i've got
[31:05] some ravens that are going to feed you
[31:06] and some angels
[31:08] that are going to take care of you and
[31:10] comfort you
[31:11] and you know when elijah had lost his
[31:13] church
[31:15] he had lost everything then he was weak
[31:18] and then when he could call on the
[31:20] heavens and call for it not to reign
[31:23] until he called for it again
[31:27] he had power to shut up the heavens
[31:30] jacob lost all his strength he wrestled
[31:34] all night with the angel of the lord
[31:36] the angel touched him took his strength
[31:40] but jacob wouldn't let go just as the
[31:43] song said kept
[31:45] holding on and you know
[31:48] then god gave him power to become a
[31:51] prince
[31:54] amen paul lost all of his education and
[31:58] all of his theology
[32:00] he had to let all that go everything he
[32:02] knew
[32:03] everything he had learned every every uh
[32:07] thing that he had relied upon before
[32:10] he had to let all that go and when he
[32:12] did then god made him a missionary to
[32:15] the gentile
[32:18] moses lost all of his ability and became
[32:20] weak
[32:23] he had you know he was a great warrior
[32:27] in egypt but he lost all that
[32:31] and then 40 more years down the road
[32:33] when he was 80 years old god spoke to
[32:36] him and said now
[32:37] i'm going to send you back to egypt
[32:40] the prophet of god said moses wanted to
[32:42] go back with an army behind him
[32:44] but god sent him back with the stick and
[32:47] his wife and child
[32:48] upon a upon a mule going back
[32:51] to take over egypt
[32:57] but that wasn't what how moses wanted it
[32:59] moses brother branham said wanted an
[33:01] army behind him
[33:03] that's how he had planned it out but
[33:05] that's not how
[33:06] god does things could have been an army
[33:08] behind him then it would look like
[33:10] it was the power and strength of the
[33:12] army that brought him out
[33:14] but god had promised abraham that i'll
[33:16] bring them out with the mighty hand
[33:25] god passes those people who think
[33:27] they're something
[33:29] think they've got strength think they're
[33:31] really something
[33:32] and it goes to the people who know
[33:34] they're they're not anybody
[33:36] they're not looking for anything to do
[33:38] anything
[33:39] they don't think they got any strength
[33:41] within themselves and god uses them to
[33:44] serve his purpose
[33:46] the more you can forget your education
[33:49] the more you can
[33:50] forget brother brown said all your stuff
[33:53] he said
[33:54] the more god can use you the more you
[33:57] yield to god the more he can use you
[34:01] the problem is many times instead of us
[34:04] being weak
[34:05] we're too strong the prophet said we're
[34:08] too strong-headed
[34:10] we're too strong-willed and we want to
[34:13] yield to ourselves
[34:15] instead of yielding to god and that's
[34:18] why god allows things to come along
[34:21] to remind us of our weakness
[34:24] to show us that we have need that he's
[34:27] the one
[34:28] that's his might it's his strength amen
[34:34] when we become weak then he can make his
[34:37] own purpose
[34:40] brother branham said in the message many
[34:43] times
[34:44] when he was in the prayer line he said
[34:46] that he was he said i'm weak
[34:52] as they would come through the more they
[34:55] would come through and pull on that gift
[34:56] the weaker he would get
[35:00] but it had nothing to do with him
[35:02] telling him what was wrong with them
[35:04] it didn't affect that it didn't affect
[35:07] us saith the lord
[35:08] thus saith the lord was still just as
[35:10] strong as ever
[35:12] brother venom said when i'm weak he's
[35:14] strong
[35:16] amen pardon me
[35:21] i think about the woman during the time
[35:23] of the famine in the bible
[35:26] and elijah came by
[35:30] the prophet and here she was
[35:33] she was at the end of her road
[35:36] she said i've got just a little bit of
[35:40] meal in the barrel i've got just a
[35:41] little bit of
[35:43] oil in the cruise i'm going to make a
[35:46] cake for me and my son
[35:47] and then we're going to die she was at
[35:49] the end of a road
[35:51] there was seemingly no hope left for her
[35:55] there was no one she could go and borrow
[35:57] some more meal from
[35:58] nobody else had any either there wasn't
[36:02] anything
[36:02] else she could lean upon and then god
[36:05] asked for what she even had left
[36:10] that's the way god will do when you
[36:12] think you ain't got nothing left he'll
[36:14] ask for what
[36:15] little you've got left to see what
[36:17] you'll do with it see if you'll give it
[36:19] to him
[36:20] will you dedicate it to him
[36:24] but you notice when elijah spoke to her
[36:26] he said
[36:27] go make me a cake first then
[36:30] do as you said and make for you and your
[36:33] son
[36:34] so he didn't say go make me a cake and
[36:36] you two die
[36:37] he said go make me a cake first she said
[36:41] i've only got a little bit for one cake
[36:43] he said well go make me one first
[36:45] then do what you said and make for you
[36:47] and your son for thus
[36:48] saith the lord the mill burial not waste
[36:52] and the cruce of all will not run dry
[36:56] hallelujah she had thus saith the lord
[36:59] then
[36:59] then she could go on thus saith the lord
[37:02] and go make
[37:03] him a cake first but god tried her
[37:06] she was tested she was down to the end
[37:09] of her rope
[37:10] there was nowhere else left to go she
[37:14] was indeed
[37:14] in her weakness she was at her weakest
[37:18] state she had gave up we're gonna die
[37:27] then we recall as the story goes on
[37:32] that her son did die and
[37:37] she said what if what have you done to
[37:39] me man of god
[37:40] i've done what you asked and now god's
[37:43] taken my son
[37:46] so elijah took the boy carried him up to
[37:49] the loft where he
[37:50] slept laid himself upon the boy three
[37:54] times and prayed and said god
[37:56] what's happened here bring this soul
[37:58] back into this boy
[38:00] and the bible says the soul of the boy
[38:02] came back into
[38:04] him and he raised up
[38:07] amen god
[38:10] is strong he makes the impossible
[38:14] possible in the most impossible
[38:18] situations god shows up
[38:21] when when when lazarus was dead and in
[38:25] the grave
[38:25] three days gone
[38:29] then jesus came on the scene
[38:34] martha said i wish you'd have been here
[38:35] before
[38:37] because if you'd have been here before
[38:38] you could have prayed for my brother and
[38:40] god would have healed him
[38:42] but now by now lord he speaketh that
[38:45] didn't mean nothing to god
[38:47] that would his that was not beyond his
[38:50] strength
[38:53] he could bring a body back from decay
[38:59] hallelujah remember the time elisha
[39:04] they throw them bodies in on his bones
[39:07] they come back to life
[39:09] [Applause]
[39:13] it hallelujah matter that that he stunk
[39:15] it didn't matter he had decayed
[39:17] that wasn't beyond god there's nothing
[39:20] in your life
[39:21] that is beyond the strength of god
[39:23] almighty god
[39:25] there's nothing that you face that god
[39:29] can't come on the scene and turn the
[39:31] situation around
[39:32] i don't care how impossible it looks
[39:37] there's nothing we go through what god
[39:40] doesn't allow us to go through
[39:42] and he does it for a reason to serve his
[39:46] purpose
[39:49] hallelujah he allowed paul
[39:52] to be constantly buffeted by the devil
[39:57] but we learned on sunday that my grace
[40:00] is sufficient means a lot
[40:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[40:09] the bible says the mill bearer wasted
[40:11] not in the crucial oil
[40:13] never failed why was thus saith the lord
[40:19] remember after the crucifixion of jesus
[40:23] mary came to the tomb
[40:27] mary was sad
[40:30] mary had been up three days and three
[40:33] nights
[40:34] after the crucifixion she had been up
[40:38] she was weak she was tired
[40:42] she was coming to dress the body
[40:45] and when she got there in her weakness
[40:48] there was nobody there the body was gone
[40:52] he was missing
[40:54] but the voice spoke to her and said why
[40:58] why why why we pushed our woman
[41:03] she said they've come and took the body
[41:06] of my lord
[41:08] carried it away and i don't know where
[41:10] they took it
[41:13] she was weak and at this point
[41:17] she didn't know what to do she was at
[41:19] wits in
[41:21] what where was he what was she to do now
[41:24] how could she find him how could she
[41:26] tell the others
[41:28] but then that voice spoken said mary
[41:33] and when that voice spoke strength came
[41:35] into her
[41:36] that voice spoke her name she knew that
[41:39] voice
[41:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[41:44] amen then she was strong
[41:47] hallelujah
[41:50] you know abraham
[41:53] as time passed abraham got older and he
[41:56] got older and he got older and sarah got
[41:58] older and older
[42:02] and as time passed the further it looked
[42:05] like
[42:05] they got from the promise
[42:08] being able to come to pass
[42:12] no wonder sarah laughed within herself
[42:16] because they had reached a place where
[42:19] they were beyond seemingly that it could
[42:22] even happen
[42:27] but you know god let it go so
[42:30] far the further he lets it go the
[42:32] greater the miracle is
[42:35] that's the way he does in our lives
[42:37] sometimes we go through a trial we go
[42:39] through
[42:40] we're facing something and it seems like
[42:42] we look at it and we we don't know a way
[42:44] out
[42:45] we don't know what to do we don't know
[42:47] how long it's going to go on
[42:49] you know as humans we would like it to
[42:50] end pretty quick
[42:52] many times when we get down to pray
[42:54] that's what we're praying for is god to
[42:56] bring a quick resolution
[42:58] to the problem but sometimes it doesn't
[43:00] work that way
[43:02] sometimes it goes on and on and on it
[43:05] seems to drag on
[43:06] and it's like god you think does he even
[43:10] hear me
[43:12] [Music]
[43:13] that's when you've got to know that he
[43:16] is god
[43:24] hallelujah
[43:28] it's not about anything that we can do
[43:32] but it's what god has already done for
[43:34] us through christ
[43:37] there was nothing abraham could do
[43:40] but it was only what jehovah could do
[43:46] a lot of times brother branham said
[43:47] people say i'm so
[43:49] tempted this is in time testament worlds
[43:52] of god
[43:54] a lot of times people say i'm so tempted
[43:58] blessed be the name of the lord for the
[44:00] temptations
[44:03] that's hard to say that isn't it
[44:06] blessed be the name of the lord for the
[44:08] temptations
[44:10] for when i am weak then i
[44:13] am strong
[44:16] every son that cometh to god must first
[44:18] be tried and tested
[44:21] and these testings are more sweeter to
[44:23] you and dear to you
[44:24] than precious gold
[44:28] everyone's got to be tested
[44:32] tested to see if you'll stand in the
[44:34] face of of
[44:36] the impossible
[44:42] i know me and my family went through
[44:47] a deep dark trial some years a few years
[44:49] back
[44:51] and you know when something happens to
[44:54] you
[44:55] why you feel like you're gonna be okay
[44:58] or whatever you know but when it happens
[45:00] to a family member like your child
[45:03] then that's different and
[45:06] this had come against our youngest son
[45:09] and here we were you know and i was
[45:12] looking for a way out i was looking for
[45:15] a way to make the thing come to a
[45:17] resolution
[45:18] to come to an end nothing i did worked
[45:25] i prayed about it
[45:28] submitted my ideals to god
[45:34] let's just be honest i submitted my
[45:38] thoughts to god and i think if we do
[45:39] this and this god
[45:41] this will just end
[45:44] but it didn't work that way and it drug
[45:47] on
[45:48] and it drug on and it drove on because
[45:49] you know what
[45:51] god didn't want it just to go away
[45:55] he wanted my son to be totally absolved
[46:00] to where it would show his innocence
[46:04] god knows how to work things out
[46:08] he's got a better plan than we could
[46:10] come up with
[46:13] there was many times that we grew weak
[46:15] during those times
[46:17] do you know what helped us we knew we
[46:20] had people praying for us
[46:23] there might have been people praying for
[46:24] us and didn't even know what they were
[46:26] praying for but it didn't matter
[46:28] they were praying for us there was
[46:31] prayer requests going up for us
[46:34] we had our family praying for us
[46:40] it brought strength and times when we
[46:43] are weak
[46:45] hallelujah
[46:48] brother branham says when i'm weak
[46:52] then i'm strong because i know there's a
[46:55] blessing
[46:56] laying ahead that satan's trying to get
[46:58] me away from it
[47:01] but i just keep going on anyhow
[47:07] i just keep going on anyhow satan just
[47:11] you satan buffeted you brother i'm
[47:14] saying no there's a blessing just on the
[47:16] other side of it
[47:18] god wants to bless you god wants to
[47:21] deliver you
[47:22] god wants to set you free god wants to
[47:26] bring you out
[47:30] we just have to be patient that's where
[47:33] we have problems sometimes
[47:35] is with our patients we're not patient
[47:40] amen to wait for the promise to come
[47:46] [Music]
[47:47] after we've done all that we can do
[47:50] then be patient
[47:56] we know none of us ever pray god
[47:59] please give me some patience
[48:02] because we know the bible says
[48:05] tribulations
[48:06] worketh patience
[48:11] but that's why we face them that's why
[48:13] we go through them
[48:16] god's given us patience
[48:21] some of us struggle with it more than
[48:23] others
[48:27] we live in a world that's full of
[48:32] impatience
[48:34] you know we used to have dial-up
[48:36] internet you know on a modem you know
[48:38] make that sound that it would make maybe
[48:40] maybe you can remember that sound you
[48:42] know
[48:44] and you could you could be in the middle
[48:47] of a college test and lose connection
[48:49] and there it all went
[48:51] right and it was so slow
[48:55] and then we got in it was faster
[48:59] and it still wasn't fast enough so they
[49:02] made it faster
[49:03] and it's still not fast enough now we've
[49:06] got some of the fastest internet out
[49:08] there and we're still
[49:09] punching the mouse because it's not fast
[49:11] enough
[49:12] we're impatient people
[49:19] fast food
[49:24] and i've seen people in the line the
[49:26] fast food line complaining because it
[49:28] wasn't fast enough
[49:34] this stuff that you're going to feed me
[49:35] that's going to make my cholesterol go
[49:37] up that's going to make my sugar go up
[49:40] it's just going to make my triglycerides
[49:42] go up you're not giving it to me fast
[49:43] enough
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:46] [Music]
[49:50] instant potatoes
[49:53] instant oats
[49:56] what's it all about you know then they
[49:58] invented microwaves you know because
[50:01] it wasn't quick enough to cook it on the
[50:02] oven or the stove
[50:04] so we got microwaves now i remember when
[50:07] they came out when i was a kid
[50:10] some of you young ones here probably
[50:11] grew up with microwaves
[50:20] microwave popcorn when i was a kid
[50:24] we got popcorn my dad put popcorn in a
[50:26] in a
[50:27] pot and shook it over the fire back and
[50:30] forth to pop the corn
[50:35] now they just pop a bag in the microwave
[50:37] and push a button that says popcorn they
[50:39] don't even got to take time to punch in
[50:40] the time
[50:41] they just push a button that says
[50:43] popcorn
[50:45] this world is full of impatience and
[50:48] it's just making the people more
[50:50] impatient
[50:51] they want things quicker and quicker and
[50:53] quicker and quicker
[50:54] but that's not how god does it if god
[50:58] would give it to you just the
[51:00] second you said that you thought you had
[51:02] a need you don't want you'd be a bunch
[51:03] of spoiled brats
[51:06] but god wants you to be sons and
[51:09] daughters
[51:10] of god
[51:12] [Applause]
[51:14] tried through the fire
[51:17] come out the other side victorious
[51:20] hallelujah
[51:24] brother branham says god don't have any
[51:26] little weak parts
[51:28] and then big strong parts he's just
[51:31] all together god
[51:34] and he said if you just had a shadow of
[51:37] god in you
[51:39] that's enough power to create the world
[51:50] because god doesn't have any weak parts
[51:54] he's all together strong
[52:04] it's god and it's strong right now and
[52:07] every believer in here
[52:09] has life eternal which is god's spirit
[52:12] in you enough power
[52:14] that'll raise up the dead that'll heal
[52:16] the sick
[52:18] that'll set orbits into conditions
[52:22] it reminds me of those gates of the
[52:24] spirit you know
[52:26] brother branham liking them to be in
[52:27] planets
[52:29] and they could set them in their proper
[52:31] orbit
[52:32] sometimes you know the devil can get in
[52:35] there and influence those gates
[52:38] and get us all out of orbit
[52:41] so to speak
[52:46] influence your affections
[52:49] influence your affections for your
[52:51] children so that you're looking at them
[52:53] more with filial love than you are agape
[52:55] love
[52:58] agape love wants to see him saved
[53:01] filio love just wants to cling on to him
[53:08] but agape love wants to see him saved at
[53:10] any cost
[53:16] friends the life we're living in here is
[53:18] very short
[53:22] the bible says our life's like a blade
[53:24] of grass
[53:26] it comes and it goes it's like a flower
[53:30] blooms and then it wilts and it's gone
[53:35] job said what happens
[53:38] after man dies
[53:44] he said the flower comes back up
[53:47] but what happens to man and god
[53:52] you know job was in his weakest state
[53:58] he had church members telling him he was
[54:00] a secret sinner
[54:01] that's why he was being beset by so many
[54:05] things
[54:06] that's why so many things were going
[54:08] wrong something's wrong
[54:10] with you job the random said
[54:13] when things are going against you like
[54:14] that it doesn't mean that you've done
[54:16] something wrong
[54:18] it doesn't mean god's trying to correct
[54:20] you
[54:21] it just means that you're being tried as
[54:23] a son
[54:24] and daughter of god
[54:28] god's working on you
[54:31] to perfect you
[54:36] hallelujah the spirit that's
[54:38] in you that same spirit that you've got
[54:42] in you will raise you up on the day of
[54:44] resurrection
[54:47] amen that's how much power
[54:50] resides in a born-again believer
[54:55] your flesh may be weak but you've got
[54:58] power on the inside as brother branham
[55:02] said
[55:03] if you've got just a little shadow of
[55:05] god in you if you just got a little
[55:08] speck of god
[55:11] you've got all the power you need
[55:16] well i'm not very much you know i'm not
[55:18] a preacher and
[55:20] i don't pray for the sick and i you know
[55:23] i'm
[55:23] i'm just you know
[55:27] a stay-at-home mom and hey
[55:30] there's nothing wrong with that
[55:34] you've got just as much right to pray
[55:36] for your children as anybody
[55:38] else more right than the preacher's god
[55:41] god's got to hear your prayers too
[55:45] hallelujah you've got power to raise the
[55:48] debt
[55:51] hallelujah
[55:57] many times we think that when we're
[56:00] feeling good that's when we can really
[56:03] give a good testimony
[56:06] that's when our testimony really could
[56:07] count
[56:09] the prophet said that's not when your
[56:10] testimony counts
[56:13] he said it's when you're down and weak
[56:16] and troubled that's when your testimony
[56:20] counts
[56:24] oh i'd say just just the lord moved on
[56:27] paul to sing that song right before i
[56:29] came out
[56:32] hallelujah just hold on
[56:42] hallelujah
[56:44] adam says as long as you've got some of
[56:45] yourself in there
[56:47] god can't do nothing with you but when
[56:50] you empty out
[56:52] right empty all of your own ideals out
[56:56] empty all yourself out
[57:00] paul said i'll glory in my infirmities
[57:02] of my weakness
[57:06] thanking god brother adam said i got all
[57:08] of me out of me
[57:11] when i get everything out of me then god
[57:13] can come in but as long as you got some
[57:15] of myself in there
[57:17] then god can't get in
[57:20] who's strong enough to
[57:24] tamed the devil which one of us
[57:28] here is strong enough to say well i'll
[57:31] take him on
[57:37] god's the only one strong enough to tame
[57:38] the devil
[57:42] but remember probably said if you just
[57:44] had a little speck of god in you
[57:47] that's enough hallelujah
[57:50] don't try to take him on yourself but if
[57:54] you've got just a speck of god in you
[57:56] you're more than a match for him
[58:00] hallelujah there was a voice one time
[58:03] that tamed the devils put clothes back
[58:06] on them
[58:08] and set them free in their mind and put
[58:10] them back in their right mind
[58:13] and that same voices give promise to us
[58:22] brother ram says pour out all of
[58:24] yourself
[58:25] and let the holy ghost come in and flood
[58:27] every part of you
[58:28] saturate every part of your being
[58:38] deny your own abilities the prophet said
[58:46] i i don't know about you but
[58:49] anytime a problem presents itself to me
[58:51] i'm always trying to figure
[58:52] a way to solve that problem
[58:56] and the problem presents itself to the
[58:58] family i'm always trying to figure out a
[59:00] way to solve that problem
[59:04] and i'm constantly have to be reminded
[59:07] god didn't put me here to solve problems
[59:10] god put me here to trust in him he's the
[59:12] problem solver
[59:20] and so sometimes i know to people
[59:24] especially in my church something to be
[59:27] going on
[59:27] they'll think well brother jerry ain't
[59:29] moving on that very quick
[59:31] i don't even know if he knows what's
[59:33] going on
[59:36] i'm just waiting because i know i can't
[59:39] handle it myself
[59:41] but i know when god tells me what to do
[59:43] and i do what god says do
[59:45] then there's going to be some results
[59:49] but if i try to jump in it myself i'll
[59:51] just make a mess of it
[59:55] so i wait on the lord when i
[59:58] first started pastoring there was a dear
[1:00:01] brother spoke to me
[1:00:04] and he said brother jerry
[1:00:07] said if i could pass anything along to
[1:00:10] you
[1:00:10] to help you starting out
[1:00:13] it would be patience just
[1:00:17] wait on god
[1:00:20] there was brother donnie reagan that
[1:00:21] told me that
[1:00:24] said if i could pass on anything to you
[1:00:26] it would be patience
[1:00:28] hallelujah paul talked
[1:00:32] to god he talked to him jesus in the
[1:00:36] form that he was before he became flesh
[1:00:43] and he told paul my grace is sufficient
[1:00:47] boy that means a lot what do we have
[1:00:49] need of god
[1:00:52] my grace it's sufficient
[1:00:57] deliver me god my grace is sufficient
[1:01:01] to take you through
[1:01:05] hallelujah i tell you when i
[1:01:09] studied on that message noah found grace
[1:01:14] oh that did something for me it showed
[1:01:17] me just how much grace really means
[1:01:19] when it says my grace is sufficient it's
[1:01:22] sufficient
[1:01:23] that's what we need is his grace paul
[1:01:26] said i will glory in my infirmities
[1:01:32] that's a strong statement i'll glory in
[1:01:35] my infirmities
[1:01:37] well it's hard to do that
[1:01:40] but when you realize
[1:01:43] that it's god allowing you to come down
[1:01:45] to your weak stage so that he can come
[1:01:47] on the scene
[1:01:58] when things when i was younger
[1:02:01] a younger father had younger children
[1:02:07] when things would arise knees and that i
[1:02:11] would think
[1:02:11] man
[1:02:15] why'd this have to come along
[1:02:20] what a hassle this is but as i got older
[1:02:25] my children would call on me dad i
[1:02:28] i've got to go to the hospital and i've
[1:02:32] got to have surgery and i need
[1:02:33] somebody to take me up there and stay
[1:02:35] with me and drive me home
[1:02:37] yes i get to be their hero today
[1:02:42] dad my car's broke down what am i going
[1:02:44] to do i'm out here stuck
[1:02:46] somewhere i'll be right there
[1:02:50] why i got a chance to be a hero
[1:02:55] that's the way god is when we've got a
[1:02:59] need
[1:03:00] then he has a chance to come be our hero
[1:03:03] he's got a chance to come on the scene
[1:03:06] and do something for us
[1:03:08] he wants to do for his children it's not
[1:03:11] a hassle to him
[1:03:13] when you call on him in need it's it's
[1:03:16] not
[1:03:17] oh they're going to take up my time
[1:03:19] again i had something else planned
[1:03:21] no he's right on time right on the scene
[1:03:28] even when he's late he's on time
[1:03:31] like with lazarus
[1:03:36] hallelujah
[1:03:39] brother branham said talking about paul
[1:03:43] paul said except i get exalted i want to
[1:03:46] build some great seminaries
[1:03:48] everything else some great something
[1:03:49] another
[1:03:51] lest i get exalted above abundance in
[1:03:53] this revelation
[1:03:54] god let the messenger of the devil keep
[1:03:56] me beat down
[1:03:58] then when i'm weak i'm strong brother
[1:04:01] ram said
[1:04:02] it's the growing pains of grace
[1:04:08] growing pains of god's grace
[1:04:11] when you're experiencing growing pains
[1:04:13] that's a good thing
[1:04:15] you're mature and you know i always look
[1:04:18] at the beginning of a new year
[1:04:20] and i look back over the year that i
[1:04:22] just come through
[1:04:24] and i want to see how i've progressed
[1:04:27] from that over that year am i better off
[1:04:31] than i was
[1:04:32] when the the last year had started how
[1:04:35] much closer am i to god's what i'm
[1:04:37] saying
[1:04:37] not anything about physical things or
[1:04:41] you know really or or about things of
[1:04:44] this world
[1:04:45] but am i closer to god do i have more
[1:04:48] understanding than i had the year before
[1:04:51] does this word mean more to me than it
[1:04:53] did before
[1:04:55] hallelujah am i not in the same place
[1:04:59] with god but have i got closer have i
[1:05:01] moved further along
[1:05:03] am i further along in my journey and my
[1:05:05] cloak getting closer to the end
[1:05:12] growing pains of grace
[1:05:19] we got to yield ourselves to the spirit
[1:05:22] of god and go where the spirit says go
[1:05:28] brother talks about he calls him
[1:05:31] god's soldiers in hebrews 11.
[1:05:35] he says or rather heroes
[1:05:40] god's heroes and he says
[1:05:44] out of weakness they were made strong
[1:05:47] they had to get weak before they could
[1:05:48] get strong out of the weakness they were
[1:05:50] made strong
[1:05:53] hebrews 11 32 says what more
[1:05:58] what shall i more say for the time would
[1:06:00] fail me to tell of gideon and barack
[1:06:03] and em samson and japheth and david and
[1:06:06] samuel
[1:06:07] and of the prophets who through faith
[1:06:10] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[1:06:12] obtained promises
[1:06:13] stomped the mouths of lions quenched
[1:06:16] the violence of fire escaped the edge of
[1:06:20] the sword
[1:06:21] out of weakness were made strong
[1:06:24] wax valiant that means mighty
[1:06:30] strong they wax valiant in fight
[1:06:34] and turn to flight the armies of the
[1:06:36] aliens
[1:06:39] isaiah 35 3 it says strengthen ye the
[1:06:43] weak hands
[1:06:44] confirm the feeble knees say to them
[1:06:48] that are of a weak
[1:06:49] fearful heart be strong fear not
[1:06:53] behold your god will come with vengeance
[1:06:56] even
[1:06:56] god with the recompense he will come and
[1:06:59] save you
[1:07:04] hallelujah god comes on the scene
[1:07:12] and he always comes on the scene at the
[1:07:14] right time
[1:07:18] i was my mother had come down to visit
[1:07:22] us
[1:07:25] and uh on the day she was to fly back
[1:07:27] while it was raining really hard
[1:07:31] and where i live when it rains really
[1:07:35] hard
[1:07:35] there's always a lot of accidents people
[1:07:37] have trouble driving in the rain
[1:07:42] lord help them if the snow comes
[1:07:45] they have trouble driving in the rain
[1:07:48] and a lot of accidents
[1:07:50] and so i was taking my mother to the
[1:07:53] airport in the rain and as i got on the
[1:07:55] other side of nashville
[1:07:57] why i seen the traffic that was going
[1:08:01] west was just backed up
[1:08:04] and i thought boy i really don't want to
[1:08:06] get into that
[1:08:07] stop and go stop and go in the rain
[1:08:10] not knowing how long you're going to be
[1:08:12] sitting there
[1:08:14] and so i thought i'll take a different
[1:08:15] route home
[1:08:17] so after i dropped her off i went and
[1:08:19] got on a different route that went up a
[1:08:21] different way around nashville and
[1:08:23] i thought i'll just ride this route out
[1:08:25] and uh
[1:08:26] but you know on that route you can only
[1:08:28] go 55 miles an hour
[1:08:32] so it was a little slow and so
[1:08:36] as i got on up around that route and got
[1:08:39] up to where
[1:08:40] it intersected with 65 i thought well
[1:08:42] i'll just get off on 65
[1:08:44] and go take it south back into nashville
[1:08:47] and
[1:08:47] go that way and i got off on 65
[1:08:51] and it was stand still traffic
[1:08:54] i sat there a little bit and i thought
[1:08:56] my goodness i'm not going to sit in this
[1:08:58] traffic i'm just going to get off the
[1:08:59] next section i'm going to turn around
[1:09:00] i'm going to go back and get back on
[1:09:02] that other route and just drive 55.
[1:09:05] so that's what we did i had michael with
[1:09:08] me
[1:09:09] and so we went we got off on the next
[1:09:11] exit we went back
[1:09:12] up to bradley parkway and got back on it
[1:09:15] and started back around that way and we
[1:09:17] hadn't went far at all
[1:09:18] and the traffic came to a standstill and
[1:09:21] i didn't know what it was
[1:09:23] and i thought why is the traffic moving
[1:09:25] here this is a route around nashville it
[1:09:27] always moves
[1:09:29] and so i got a hold of mina and she was
[1:09:32] at home and i told her
[1:09:34] and so she helped me get onto the
[1:09:37] traffic cam so i could see what was
[1:09:38] going on up there
[1:09:40] so i pulled the traffic cams up on my
[1:09:42] phone and there was an accident
[1:09:44] just up just up the road a little ways
[1:09:46] from where we were
[1:09:48] there wasn't no exit up there or
[1:09:50] entrance or nothing like that i don't
[1:09:51] know how the accident happened
[1:09:54] but i told michael i said michael that
[1:09:57] was god had his kid off on 65.
[1:10:02] if i stayed on here we'd have perhaps
[1:10:04] been in that accident
[1:10:09] and we were sitting there and we watched
[1:10:12] on the traffic cams and we saw
[1:10:14] about four ambulances coming there
[1:10:16] taking people out
[1:10:18] rushing them out we sat there i don't
[1:10:21] know how long we sat there a long time
[1:10:23] there was no
[1:10:25] you know it seemed like no sense what to
[1:10:27] do you know there was traffic behind you
[1:10:29] traffic around
[1:10:30] you everybody was at a standstill then
[1:10:33] all of a sudden the police
[1:10:34] had got out and started walking up there
[1:10:36] and they were turning people around
[1:10:38] having to turn their cars around and go
[1:10:40] back to the last exit
[1:10:42] and get off and the policeman actually
[1:10:44] said do you know where you're at
[1:10:46] good enough to to find your way home
[1:10:48] from there and i said yes i can
[1:10:51] and so we went back and you know where
[1:10:53] we ended up back on 65 again
[1:10:58] but i was in a total different frame of
[1:11:01] mind
[1:11:03] we had to wait through some traffic to
[1:11:05] get up where we were going but i was
[1:11:07] in a different frame of mind because i
[1:11:10] kept telling michael michael it was god
[1:11:12] that delayed us
[1:11:14] it was god that had all this delay
[1:11:16] because otherwise we would have been in
[1:11:18] that accident
[1:11:19] but god knew what he was doing he
[1:11:21] prevented that
[1:11:26] hallelujah he knows what he's doing even
[1:11:29] when we don't know what we're doing
[1:11:34] hallelujah god's always there to take
[1:11:37] care of you
[1:11:40] we had no idea accident was going to
[1:11:42] happen up there how could anybody know
[1:11:43] that
[1:11:44] but god knew amen and he kept us out of
[1:11:48] it
[1:11:48] because friends i i figured out in time
[1:11:51] if we would have stayed on there we'd
[1:11:52] have been riding that that
[1:11:54] uh pile up
[1:11:57] and it was so bad like i told you there
[1:11:59] was about four or five ambulances came
[1:12:01] in there taking people out
[1:12:05] oh praise the lord god's always looking
[1:12:09] out for us
[1:12:13] my youngest daughter and youngest son
[1:12:16] they
[1:12:16] used to ride to college together
[1:12:21] and uh my son had learned this back road
[1:12:24] from the college over to the
[1:12:25] to get on the route to come home
[1:12:29] and it was through a development you
[1:12:32] know a neighborhood of real nice houses
[1:12:35] but it was kind of hilly and
[1:12:39] it was in the wintertime and there was a
[1:12:41] little bit of ice on the road
[1:12:43] we get freezing rain down there and
[1:12:46] there was a little ice on the road and
[1:12:48] you come down the hill
[1:12:49] and there's a stop sign at the bottom of
[1:12:51] the hill
[1:12:52] and here he was coming down there in
[1:12:54] that car and he
[1:12:55] went to put on the brakes and the car
[1:12:57] just started sliding around
[1:12:58] he thought oh my what's going to happen
[1:13:01] because i can't make
[1:13:02] i can't stop from that stop sign and the
[1:13:05] the other the route that was coming
[1:13:07] through there didn't have a stop sign it
[1:13:08] was it wasn't a four-way stop
[1:13:10] it was only a two-way stop and he come
[1:13:13] down through there
[1:13:14] and there was no cars coming and he slid
[1:13:16] right on through that intersection
[1:13:19] he gave a testimony at church
[1:13:22] we had a thanksgiving night
[1:13:26] where we come for thanksgiving after
[1:13:29] thanksgiving and we
[1:13:30] we just had a testimony night and he got
[1:13:33] up and gave that testimony
[1:13:35] how god had his hand upon them
[1:13:38] hallelujah
[1:13:39] god's always watching out for your
[1:13:40] friends
[1:13:42] there's no trouble that can come your
[1:13:44] way
[1:13:49] you know when abraham

[1:15:06] nurse his own strength
[1:15:08] his own spirit as a baptism
[1:15:11] back into our weak bodies to give us
[1:15:14] faith
