father thank you Lord for your grace that's been provided for us Lord open the way and to reveal that way Lord to us Lord we love you this morning Lord we just want to say Lord how thankful we are for your presence it means everything to us so wonderful Lord it's you lord it's you that we love we ask that Lord that you just help us Lord together this morning speaker in here help us to for these next few moments to step out of the way Lord not only that you could speak to us but move in our lives Lord and do Lord only what you can do father we just the Lord asked that you would just just Lord for just a few moments because we know that Lord what you accomplished and what every time down Through the Ages when man has got into your presence one time it has affected their lives forever for Eternal for eternally Lord and I believe God the things that you desire to do and you're doing in our lives their Eternal Lord you're changing us from Glory unto Glory God we just want to stand still and let the word of God Close Our Lives Lord we love you Lord this morning we just Lord pray you're just bless Lord each and every one of your children every need and request that they have on their heart whether it's Lord for a loved one whether it's the Lord for sickness and their body whether it's Lord something Lord in their mind or their Spirit Lord or their soul Lord Jesus you're all that we have need of Lord now God Miss we look to you may you Lord God just send forth your word that healing bomb o God and minister to every life and every heart is here may assurances drop Lord that it's over it's finished Lord father even Lord those of a loved one that we may not see here but may the Assurance of the Holy Ghost just come Lord and just drop Lord in our hearts this morning we pray Lord we know that God it's not what we can do or make happen but we want to surrender to you because it's your voice that means more than every other voice Lord Lord we want to give preeminence to your voice or to the word have your way this morning we pray father granted Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen you love him that's so good to us isn't he and I which reminds you of the communion service next week next Sunday and um just to be in prayer and keep that in mind as well I also want to say here this morning we certainly want to welcome the Aaron Basics here with us and from there from brother Nathan Bryant's assembly there in Indiana and uh just just good friends and they came to spend some time with us this weekend so that means a lot amen and so we so enjoyed the fellowship that we've had with him here throughout yesterday and then the opportunity for them to be here with us and it's just been a real privilege to get to meet them and to know them from the times when we our paths at crossword brother Nathan and uh just it's just wonderful how God brings friends in your life isn't it you know I say this often and uh you know sometimes we I can if you wasn't like this as a young person will you forgive me and Overlook it you know but you know sometimes as a young person and things and sometimes those things can continue on when we're older we always want to I would like to be friends with this person I want to be friends with this person and we're always looking and but you know maybe that person maybe the things right then and there maybe things don't aren't going to be complementary but to understand that when God brings friends together I believe friends are predestinated I believe that you know and I believe that when we bring friends together I believe it's not a one-way Street I believe it's two-way God told Abraham he said you'll be blessed and you'll be a blessing amen so it's wonderful isn't it when God brings our Pathways across and it just God knows what we have need of you know and I tell you that's that's a glorious Revelation when we can come to that and just say hey you know what God knows what I need the people that he brings in into our lives and us into their lives and we're we're part of a body amen and we just I'm just so thankful for that and I I just thank God for his grace and so we just appreciate the song service this morning and the the specials and so if you would turn with me First Peter chapter 5. yeah I want to read just uh from this verse of scripture here just a once again here this morning in in First Peter 5 and verse 5 amen God bless you my brother and sister keener's daughter I forgot your name I'm sorry God bless you Emily I I knew that I forgot it forgive me you know you would think being a school teacher this guy would remember names but I I had to carry a a list of people from my classroom for a month before I got their names so I wish I was better with that so that's why we give our secrets away that's why I went oh God bless you brother but I'm glad we got Grace for one another amen if there you got to have a lot of Grace with me but that's one area you really have to and I have to have it for you as well so I'm glad that God knows my name and he knows your name aren't you glad for that amen I'm glad about that amen verse 5. likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another I want you just to think of this for a moment when you see these words subject here and as it's used in the scripture um it's not a demand it is it is God's divine order that it would come out of a surrender that's what this word subjection is where it's a a surrender and so that's what it is it's not so yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you amen God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I I just like to continue the thought here this morning on Grace to the humble we've been looking at the grace of God here for some time and um I want to just go from this scripture and just recognizing and looking within it the promise and this is us this is a promise that not only has God made in verse 6 over and over through the scriptures you'll find it worded time and time again James The Book of Proverbs and so forth but you you find this that there's always it's a very simple principle but it's always it always in every case of everyone down through the heroes hall of fame in Hebrews 11. everyone that we've ever heard about in Sunday school Gideon David and so forth these were always everyone that's ever been used of God this has been the principle that they've come to and you know I want to say it in this way it has to be God's grace to lead us to the place of humility that God recognizes and so it all puts it back to it's not anything that we can do we we are insufficient in ourselves but it's God by his grace that is all sufficient to lead us to the place that we need to be and when we can see this that it's always been God fulfilling his word in his time and season in verse six I want to just let me read it once more time humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God and that is that's God revealing himself god making himself known personally to you and to me that's God's desire is to make himself known to you and I God God's not like you know someone where you go to see him and you probably never see him they just you know maybe a higher up in a company or whatever and they send out their little guys or whatever they are go see them go see what they want and go take care of them and this and that and you know the only thing you see of them is a picture oh they're the CEO of the company and they're this and I'm not saying all are like that but you understand what I mean God's not that way God matter of fact God don't want anybody else taking his message to you other than himself you might say well what's the use of preachers well listen the Bible says how can he pray preach unless he be sent how how is he sent he sent by the same Holy Ghost so it must be the spirit of God delivering the message and so that's what we must have as the spirit of the Living God and then what is that when God comes and deals with our heart that's the mighty hand of God dealing with our life and at that moment when we just surrender to that then it's when God moving in our lives he in his own due time will exalt exalt Us in his own due time and what he'll exalt is what we couldn't even see in our own selves but he knows as laid there the whole time just like the seeds that he planted in Genesis before Genesis 1 their seed was laying already in the earth and only thing that had to happen is is get rid move back all the darkness move back all of those things in order to bring forth what was there and God knows how to bring break back all the darkness and things out of our life so I want to go to Isaiah 57 15 and read here in the scripture and draw just continue to work with this point in Isaiah 57 15. it says for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I don't know about you but when you first if you just read those first few words high and laughter you would think you know you're going to see someone who comes out as that's our thoughts of things see these are thoughts these are things that the word comes to deal with is our thoughts about things but notice God's thought about what is high and lofty I whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit so now here we have the view that that which is high and lofty that which is mighty is that which is of a contrite and a humble spirit and you would think well a mighty God The God That Could part the Red Sea I know and that same God would come down and make known that he cares enough about your situation to speak to your heart to move upon your life that's what makes him God to me that he's willing to become that little that simple and God to manifest himself in his might that not only does he know my problem he cares about me but he's able to do something about it so I want you to think of this I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones I want you to listen to this this statement brother Brown makes in in the message love and he this is in regards to when he's walked into the pasture where that bull has rose up that had killed a man just the you know the just weeks ago and brother Brandon was unaware that this bull was in that um uh posture that was there and you know here's brother Bradley walks in there and I want you to notice what he says he says so here I was standing there and that's all I could do I thought well I certainly will do this how not go down a coward I'll go down showing my love of God in my heart to break in on this brother Branham at first when he tells us over and over in different places all throughout the message that that at first what came Was Fear to be natural now come on I know people sitting right here that don't act like it could be a little ant crawling on the ground I ain't gonna call no names now but let alone you say why because there's certain things that can that can bring you know fear within you you know you you get a call you know in the in the middle of the night you know or you have a you know if you know you're a mama and you get a call you know from your son and you here you are you let them know the plans of everything for the evening you get a call oh my goodness what's going on and then you realize the call was where was the peanut butter at mom you know some things that kind of alarm you is that right yeah I said mamas because usually dads are kind of like they'll be all right be all right be all right Band-Aids in there buddy peroxide if you need some in there it'd be all right that's that's that's dads but aren't you glad that God God is Not Just God is not just like that but God also He's our mother the holy spirit is our mother same God is that right to move and brood over our life so I'm just so thankful God cares aren't you uh so when we look at this brother Raymond's talking about how that even in that moment of where he he made a choice to change his thoughts because fear was gripping but you see this is to me a principle of how that when we look at it perfect love casts out all fear it didn't say that fear wouldn't come so if the devil wants to run you down of well does Fear come your life or fear has come about a doctor's report or fear listen that doesn't mean nothing about your soul are you hearing me fears can come the difference of the fear of the soul is where you don't know where you're standing with God and where you would be what if your life was required at this moment where would you stand before God you see it to live with that kind of assurance and it affects everything else in your life when you have the love of God As a matter of fact then you have the strength to overcome and subdue every fear that wants to come in so here the prophet was standing there in that moment and he says I'll go down showing my love of God in my heart and I look back at that bull and all of a sudden something happened now this sounds kiddish it sounds like a little baby talk but that's what the trouble with us tonight we tried to be an adult in God when we ought to be babies in God we know so much God dwells in the center of humility and simplicity don't never forget to Heavenly say Lord thank you for the reminder this morning thank you for the reminder let you know hey if we've got if we've got these things coming up notifications on our phone maybe this would be a good notification to come up regularly throughout the day don't never forget that I looked at the bowling of anything I could have cried for him why I thought poor creature well how wrong I am now ordinarily I wouldn't feel that way about it in the tremendous how God in that moment noticed just a thought changing of our thoughts to what is true I'm not going to go down as a coward I am going to go down with the love of God in my heart and that brother bam tells us even when the maniac came across the stage thoughts came in his mind are you with me this morning brother Ram says he sized him up in one place okay he wasn't sizing him up to see what kind of size suit he wore he was sizing him up there was still part of that of that Boxer that was still there but you see he chose to think different thoughts that's exactly the phrase that brother Brahm uses he says I chose to think different thoughts it's a choice it's a choice what a powerful thing A Simple Choice hey this Choice let me just say in reality this choice is more simple than what you're going to choose to eat after church it's real simple notice in Matthew 11 28 Jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am now watch this for I am meek and lowly humble in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light Samuel it's such a burden to serve the Lord you haven't come to this place yet because this yoke is not a yoke of bondage it's a yoke of divine love it's where everything that happens in life every test every trial it's all laced with the love and grace of almighty God it's where it's no longer his his his his word is no longer Grievous oh I have to do this oh we have to do this and if I don't do this what are the people at the church going to think are you first of all you're looking at the wrong person people you're looking at the wrong thing it's him it's about him he says come unto me not come unto it come unto me and I will give you rest for your soul so here brother Brown takes this and this this this quote I've just been pondering here over a few weeks and just just struck me how brother Brown said it and he's talking about how that even when the Lord Jesus was taken up to mount Transfiguration and we recognize at that moment here at the cloud overshadow here was Moses Elijah here was also the disciples and here there is the adornment there where his raiment did shine it's the adoption ceremony it's the placing of a son at that moment and brother Brown makes this statement and he says he says what he says what God was doing he says God never asked anybody to do anything that he doesn't do himself so let me just make it very simple it would be like if when the boss asks you to sweep the floor if the boss himself is not willing to sweep the floor and hasn't swept it before see God doesn't ask you to do something that he himself doesn't do he's our example aren't you glad that's why when God came down and became flesh it was not another set of Commandments no we didn't need another word we needed one to come and manifest and fulfill the word that was given Hallelujah God never asked anybody to do anything that he doesn't do himself that's the reason I love this that I believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ that he was more than a man he was more than a prophet yet he was a prophet yet he was a man but he was more than that he was Emmanuel he was God manifested in flesh and I believe it that's exactly what he was because any man or a prophet or an ordinary person would be born like we are and we're still in our sins but you see he was born a virgin birth and no one had nothing to do with it but God himself the god the Creator overshadowed the Virgin Mary and created in her a blood cell what did Mary finally have to come to be it unto me according to Thy Word not me not my thoughts about it but Thy Word John 1 18 no man think of this no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him but Branham says it like this and sir we would see Jesus let me know what you think of this he didn't even have a place to lay his head he didn't even have a place that would be uh what we would describe as a proper birthing place a proper place to be born it would seem this is the king of glory this is not this is not the second in command it was God himself stepping forth to redeem you and I am that's what he did in the beginning is it not God didn't send a different Spirit to come and Brew The Brood over the Earth God himself who spoke his word came himself and brought back the darkness in order to bring forth life and when the fall took place in Eden God didn't send an angel in his dead God came down God investigated Hallelujah and when it was all said and done God himself took his finger and spelled out l-o-v-e I will make her way back for you foxes have dens the scripture tells us he had nothing I'm talking about the busty one he who dwells in a high and holy place he had nothing he demanded nothing when he came because why he's here for one purpose he is the word he comes to fulfill the word and manifest the word that's the whole and full Council very simple statement here he come out of the message he come to show what God was that speaks to me listen he didn't just he didn't just come here and say Hey listen I don't have time for all this stuff I'm here I'm here to go to Calvary but along the way it was every fulfillment of every word of God the sick were being healed and the Bible says that it might be fulfilled he hath bore our sicknesses he took time Brother Richard to look at the Widow of name where she was grieving her son was being carried if we could say it in a beer which would maybe be like that of a hearse a casket here it is it's being carried he took notice of her Brokenness and he was moved the Bible said he groaned within himself and he spoke and that that life came back into that young man he cared enough we're a young man the eyes came back into not just came back but eyes were created there in the sockets the man who was born blind those that were lepers think about it those were lepers he came down and he he was concerned you might say brother Samuel he would come to me listen and I want you to understand this in the right way when he came down to the pool of Bethesda he had to step over a lot of people not on him over him because in this Mass of humanity that was sick and laid out he was sent to that pool s and me his human compassion would have healed everybody that's why this message it's for everybody brother bam says it's for everybody if they will receive it this message is not barrier lines denomination lines and this it's not it's Christ it's Christ being revealed it's will you receive him [Music] and he went to that man and that man walked away from there and he did not have anything left to remain to come back to those that were sick those that were hungry okay we could talk about one thing of being of the sickness but what about those who are hungry he took notice they're hungry we need to give them something well why don't we just close the meeting and send them home because we sure don't have enough right human thoughts would have thought that but Jesus wanted to express I am your caretaker I am your provider when you're locked in on the word and you're locked in on me I will provide all that you have need of I'm mindful of every detail even the things that you don't deem spiritual you are my children you are my spiritual sons and daughters and I am your provider he come to show what God was anything that's high and haughty somebody say it with me isn't God let me read it again anything that's high and Hardy God is low and humble now let me just tell you humble is not you drawing your attention to yourself well I've got holy pants and I've got friends you know my skirts friends and you know I'm not keeping my hair and and this and that no what you need to get cleaned up and there's people that'll help you with different it that ain't it ain't why you let in you making yourself look humble come on friends you understand what I'm saying that ain't what it is we're talking about a humility on the inside in your show [Music] because the Pharisees were humble on the outside and Jesus said you've omitted the way the Earth matters of the law you've even gave a tithe on Anderson mint and cumin but you omitted the most important thing love mercy and faith [Applause] it's not just what you see on the outside but God is a god of humility that manifests himself God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth God is low and humble and that's what made him God oh something that comes low not them that goes High so God doesn't dwell in hierarchies and things oh I'm glad he dwells in humility the way up is down humble yourself and you'll be exalted exalt yourself and you'll be humble that's right God knows how to do it and has done it and continues to do it for every one of us listen what are you saying that when God Saves us cleans our life up and fills us with the Holy Ghost he doesn't step away as one who doesn't care he's right there with you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he's the same God moving and molding and moving in our life to do what bringing us into a further place of humility because every time for the word to come forth and be expressed it will always come to pass because we have been able to Humble ourselves and that takes God's grace so you have to remember humble yourself before God don't try to think your own thoughts think his thoughts amen amen Hey listen your your mind is your is known it's called No Man's Land all right now don't interpret No Man's Land as being an empty space you know a Happy Meal without the contents that's not what we're saying but no man's land means if your mind will only be filled with what you fill it with us oh the devil no no no no the devil can only put in your mind what you allow to be put in your mind oh the devil been telling me last month he told me this like you're like you're guiding me around your mind like you've been stuck in his boxes well the devil told me this over here come over here I want to show you what devil told me over here the devil told me this right here hold on a minute he got a good one in this box right here the devil said this right over here he said this on let me see what he said it he said it back on September 15th 10 30 a.m in the morning when I woke up he said this yep it's right there in that box third one down hitting an amazing we can remember every single word of a liar and God's word is truth well brother Samuel he's speaking about my failures but your failures are not who you are the word listen to me this word of an open book never came to reveal or redeem the Fallen character it came to redeem that character that name that life that was in God the whole time Philippians 2 5. let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not Robert to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took on him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men now usually anybody who you know brother man talks about the person who made the false teeth or artificial leg or all there's a lot more things now they're people of reputation I know there's individuals sitting right here that are inventors in this congregation right here this morning and I say this I can say it real simply that are not the kind of people you wouldn't know about unless they unless you really probed and talked to him I'm not gonna call their name but you see it's kind of different when you have somebody else who's invented something and then they want to they got their own horn dude the man who invented the wrapper for bubble gum [Laughter] life-changing man life-changing whoa you say brother Samuel let me tell you you know why this you know where this Lays this lays from that first birth because the whole enticement was you'll be as God it's an enticement that's why it continually dying to ourselves and took on him the form of a servant one who's given to another's will and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross what did he pray in the garden three times nevertheless not my will but thine will be done three times it wasn't an act it wasn't a formality it was a wrestling match God's will he knew the purpose he knew what he was here for right even the previous chapters in John 12 he says now is my soul trembled trembled he knew where he was facing knew what he was coming for he knew the death that awaited him he knew that he wasn't ignorant of that and here he was if it's possible let this cup pass from me let it pass on to someone else but here the wrestling you see what it is even though he asked if it's possible let it be Pastor somebody else he couldn't get away from the will of God that he was always a part of are you hearing me now that's the same way it is in your life in my life you can't get away from the will of God of what God has willed to be about your life as a Believer as the Son and Daughter of God I don't even care where you're sitting at here this morning you can't defeat the will and purpose of almighty God you belong to God God's going to get you and he's not going to get you with an iron fist or a big arm he's going to bring you in a place of humility the same way he came nevertheless not my will thine will be done look what a victory that brought right when that was that just that that's that that that Victory hell received a torment in its own Chambers Satan was being cast out by the Finger of God of lives and Maniac could gather they were being cast out but now here comes the word and takes it right down to the chambers of hell he went through the lowest parts of hell right he he who knew no sin became my sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in Christ he deposited he took it down there and stripped Satan of his power and his authority he took his keys to his own house how would you like it today if you had to ask me for keys to get in your house you said brother Samuel that's silly no it's not you know what that speaks of that the devil don't have no power or no dominion over you he's only lying to you to try to make you think like you can't serve God you can't do this you can't live Victorious he doesn't have the keys he's been stripped of it brother the shine has a rose [Applause] [Music] Galatians 3 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Hebrews 12 2 looking unto Jesus now this looking it ain't looking like you know sometimes I talk to some individuals three of them they're here and you talk to him are you looking through me or at me where your mind at where's your mind at you can tell you know what I mean you can tell by that gaze try to keep it short and sweet how do you do that God gives Grace but you can tell you see so this looking isn't us just like looking through it no no look at him to look means you focus your mind's attention on him or what my mind got to do with it and we're dealing with that your mind's got a lot to do with it looking unto Jesus the author you say your mind don't got nothing to do tell me why the enemy wants to put everything in your mind while you sit right here in church he'll have you going down every hour of Target every hour Walmart he'll have you trying to solve problems that you got in your job and everything else you say oh well brother Samuel I'm just trying to solve this no why do you think that comes up why do you think thoughts come up when you get down to pray oh you got to remember put this way why you think it comes up you sit down to listen to a message or you're going to read your Bible why do you think them thoughts come that way oh go check the weather out right here let me tell you the weather's still going to be the weather whether and rain snow sleets or whatever more God steal God [Music] [Applause] see what happens one little distraction turns towards oh a mist opportunity say God help us God help us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith oh my who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God think of this he endured the cross despising the same the Bible said he was led as a lamb to the slaughter he did not fight going to Calvary he surrendered he was led fell many times that we know how Simon had to pick up and help him but needless to say he was carrying the cross that was needed is that right he despised the shame what kind of kind of shame that he despised by his FES because he himself became stripped till there was nothing else to be taken off it was not a loincloth there were not things wrapped around you say why would God do that because it was only displaying where you and I would have to come to a place to where we would be stripped of every single thing in our lives amen and sometimes the things that we don't even want to be stripped of I don't want nobody going there I don't want nobody judging this I don't want this I don't want that but you see he himself went to a level of shame that the vilest of Sinner no matter what you've done God himself came down and paid the price for your Redemption oh what love of God how rich and pure he came to the death of shame that nobody could say Lord you don't know my situation I was a this or I did this or I did that he went to the lowest [Applause] he bore our shame nakedness you know why that's what happened in the garden nakedness was discovered but aren't you glad there came one what Satan could not see there was fixing to come this same garment that had adorned the son of the Living God this same garment was fixing to be handed back to the Church of the Living God to the redeemed of the Lord Satan couldn't understand it why because Satan's pretense or everything that he dwells on is pride but he who is high and lofty the high and Holy One dwells in the center of humility and simplicity he defeated Satan's plan and Kingdom by humbling himself to the word aren't you glad this is why brother Bam's simple statement that day on Calvary this is one of those statements to be good put on the refrigerator because we visit there enough have your day Calvary it's a good one have your day your debris and God will have his work because you can't go and go to Calvary and come out of stuffed shirt you can go to Calvary and continue to hold your own ideas now I believe we need more trips to Calvary but you hear me I believe that God I want another trip to Calvary I normally won the trip that changes my life but I want to continue to be changed continue to be changed yeah I want to be changed So eventually this body has come to a place to match what's on the inside to repressing to that of the Rapture that here that those are alive and remain we take our glorified body and merge with our theophany and there we stand the redeemed soul theophany and glorified body I don't know about you but I I I'm I'm longing to put off this guy aren't you glad you won't have to just block his number block his text he'll be gone he'll be gone now to sight out of mind have your day at Calvary and God will have his way with you he said let me quote that again have your day at Calvary and God will have his way with you now these thoughts that we think about how many believe your thoughts matter sure they matter it's like one of the things where we get ready to go when when I play football one of the things we did in our coach in our locker room he played the same things all the time I remember the guy's name the guy it wasn't it wasn't Rudy or nothing like that but it was some guy who played knows tackle for Michigan I know that may be a bad word to speak here but he he played for it he played for Michigan as a nose tackle the guy shouldn't even been on the field and coach Cook played this thing four years straight before every game it was about it's about a guy brother Joy who should not have been on the team he was he wasn't giving a scholarship was told there ain't no way you're gonna make this team you're not going to do this you're not gonna he kept coming he kept coming he kept working he kept working kept working no doubt he had to work he had to work a lot harder and you're hearing this being told over and over you think well why would that be before a game because we weren't allowed to talk we weren't allowed to laugh there better be and I'll be nothing going on in pregame dinner or at the locker room it was complete silence get your thoughts on what you're planning to do on the business you're planning to take care of tonight you get your thoughts focused to me I think that was pretty good application you know you'll either be victorious in your thoughts or you'll be defeated if you go out thinking you're going to fight listen not just an opponent out here but if you go out of here today saying I'll never be here I'll never think this listen you are defeated by your own thoughts your thoughts don't you realize how powerful the mind is by the time did you ever get tired of hearing that no matter of fact I could probably repeat a lot of it over those times but I never got tired of repeating it because to me it always spoke about here was an individual who was the underdog absolutely impossible and when everything was wrote off but he kept being perseverant what that spoke to me is when a play don't go your way on the field get back up again and let's get more yardage when this doesn't go your way they score Hey listen I'm not trying to educate you about football I'm trying to tell you there's adversity that comes along in our life but adversity does not define you if you let it oh I'm a failure get back up again you're not a failure you might have failed but you're not a failure a failure is one who refuses to go on you don't know how many times I've failed well let me tell you his grace is so much greater than all your failed attempts because he's still dealing with your life [Applause] and I'm telling you if there's anybody here that's keeping track of your attempts they need a trip to Calvary because evidently they've forgotten the grace of God that's put up with them oh my Lord have mercy Jesus Christ the same listen this he says you you know he don't always come the way we think he's going to come this Falls crossed everything baptism of the Holy Ghost or healing on he don't come the way we think he's going to come he comes so humble the people has got it all fixed up the way they want him to come ah and we walk over humility and there's where you find God isn't that powerful we walk right over God and he's right there we're looking up here and Brother Band tells us we walk right over God why God makes himself humble in the Fulfillment of his word that brings us to a place to where where the Cardinals even getting on our knees and enough you've got to get down to see him well what is that getting down it's where it getting down in our heart getting down in our life how do I get down get away from your own thoughts scientists today can send a man into space in an orbit and walk over a blade of grass that he knows nothing about oh you got to humble yourself to know God you've got to get rid of your own ideas you talk about spring cleaning how many those words are talking about spring cleaning some of you realize when the basements were flooded and how terrible all those things were some weeks ago but some of you realize you know what she'd been doing this a long time ago should have been getting rid of this really didn't need this been keeping this been keeping that what was that that was a sweatshirt I wore in high school but honey you're 63 years old it's beyond I mean it won't even fit you it might be going around your arm right now but I doubt you down you can even get it over your head I mean why in the world you're keeping it for right but you see aren't you glad friends that there's sometimes things that we'll hold on to and we don't think too much about but God will come down and start dealing with and said hey we need to get this area cleaned out well why does he want to get it cleared out because he wants to fill it up with more of himself [Applause] oh Hallelujah you've got to get rid of your own ideas and just open up your heart and Life to him then he will make himself known to you you see we're either Victorious or defeated often times in our minds by the thoughts we allow to enter in you know we may say what do my thoughts what do they have to do with Grace and humility anytime you entertain a thought that is not the word of God it leads you away from God's desire what do you mean by entertainment I'm talking about where you let it dwell and you think on it and you start thinking on it guess what you'll start acting based on that it'll start affecting your walk with God it'll even start affecting your confession all from a thought you started to entertain listen in the beginning Satan came to Eve Eve knew God's revelation the Lord God has said but just a few moments of talking he had her breaking that revelation of Lord God yea hath God said just a few moments how powerful thoughts are so don't ever underestimate I'll tell you I'm a message believer glory to God there ain't nothing of this world going to face me and this and that you know what that's called Pride that's a homemade recipe that don't belong even in a mason jar well anytime you entertain a thought that's not the word of God it'll lead you away from God's desire but away from submission to his will let me tell you we are insufficient without God's grace in our lives the Bible said second Corinthians 10 5 everybody okay second Corinthians 10 5 casting down imaginations means throw it down not just like you're putting a box or something that's oh this is this is fragile I've carried these thoughts with me all my life I've been told this all my life so be careful this is fragile I may have to come back to this and rely on it sometime throw it down because these things were not the creation of God let me tell you something Satan comes around and has every one of our lives from when we've been little young and all the way through still we battle against complexes and sometimes here we are we are not even aware of the complexes that we still have in our life you say what is a complex it's a way of thinking a way of thinking about things and God works to continue to dismantle those things aren't you glad God don't come around like I'd be coming into your basement said all right hey come on now let's get down here and clean this junk out junk I may have had it for 50 years but it ain't junk buddy what would you think about that first of all you'd say you know what just going back home I'm not interested here because there's going to be things you're going through there's no consideration that ain't God God will work a Month of Sundays he'll work years intricately taking apart a complex in our lives and if God would be that patient with you and I Lord help me to be patient while you're working on others you see the things God teaches us even by the experiences in our own life casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought Through The Obedience of Christ Isaiah 55 7 let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts come on Friends some of you won't believe any of these characters that are so-called politicians you wouldn't dare to quote them as though that their word is in stone and this and that you know it they're nothing but a bunch of liars they can't help but it's a spirit that's on them it's a spirit upon this nation of falsehood [Music] and yet you wouldn't quote them and yet you'll quote the father of Lies will dwell upon him I'm not shaming you I'm trying to get you to see friends you wouldn't even quote somebody out there but yet you'll entertain those things you know why we'll do it it's because it seems like it's truth but you've got to realize there's a time when facts are not the truth are you with me the fact was Goliath was out in as far as physically he outmatched David that was a fact but the truth was God what's with David [Music] when they came to the promised land facts were the laws were big the walls were strong absolutely they were outmatched these people were Fighters those are facts but the truth is God Is With Us you need with why we must have the word of God the person of Truth to separate facts from truth or by the time you don't know what I'm bound with that's a fact but the truth is you are a son and daughter of God the truth is he paid the ultimate price for you truth is he shed his blood for you that's the truth the facts of your life right now mean nothing in terms of the truth it might be a fact I'm bound with this or I'm bound with that or I'm bound with that that might be facts but the truth is he whom the son is set free is free indeed what matters is the truth not your facts are you hearing me for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord Jeremiah 29 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end well brother Sammy I've had this started it's going to seem like I'm going to be able to make it that didn't come from God that didn't come from God I know you know sometimes we because we talk about the mind so much and yet sometimes we act as though that well I'll just say we maybe in general maybe you don't maybe you're beyond that but I find this that we still deal with this same principle over and over that sometimes we can disregard the mind as though when it the mind don't matter nothing at all you don't need nothing to do with the mind what you really need is the New Birth the new birth does not bypass the mind when he first came to Mary she was troubled in her mind the Bible said troubled means cast doubt how can this be but what did he do the word kept dismantling all of that that was there the word never came to her and said well I'm surprised at you you know you've read the message all these years you've said in a message Church all these years look at you all these years wow that have been encouraging wouldn't it I don't really loosened her up wouldn't it it tightened her up matter of fact she may not have even stayed there it has shamed her that he wanted God God's not interested in shame in people come on friends God don't want to guilt you into serving him I know there's a lot of movies sometimes it's made in oh my this passion and oh my it just made me now I'm not saying God can deal and sometimes God can get a hold of people's lives and they'll walk on from those things that's not what I'm saying I'm saying he can do that but sometimes listen God's not trying to guilt you like I try to make brother Joshua feel bad because he's not here early and getting chairs set out and doing this and I try to guilt him into it it's not in his heart you can't guilty if you're guilt him it'd be like somebody saying you know you ought to go call your grandma you really want to call your grandma you got to call your grandma you know your grandma's trying to shame on you man you gotta turn on your ground what's the last time you talk to Grandma don't you love your grandma come on buddy don't you that's called guilting guilty and guess what Grandma knows you've been guilted into it us into serving him he wants us to serve him because we love him so if you're feeling well I'm feeling guilted you've got the wrong feeling forsake it let that feeling go and realize the love of God is not come to guilt you the love of God is called to draw you aren't you glad for that it's what brother Adam says it must be talking about the word it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every sense of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up he goes on to say if you'll come and you'll keep their memories and conscience and everything thinking about it well I might fail it might not be right don't you do that at all let's say how in the world does this have to deal with humility do you understand where this even starts with you letting God's thoughts have first place over your own thoughts you'll never get to first base without this this is for everything in life's journey God deals with our life so that our thoughts might be let go of and sometimes we're almost like the guys you know that are 15 years old still sleeping with teddy bears we're holding on to it I've been sleeping with this so long I know I don't have a nose on I don't have an eye on it I know I've been I've been with it so long but you can't take this I I'm going to take it to college but I'll hide it under the blanket and I won't let nobody see it we've had it for so long it's become almost a security blanket there's things about our lives we've held on to that God said you don't have to hold on to it any longer you don't need a teddy bear I am your culture come down to dwell with you and to walk with you as a matter of fact I will be your friend and we'll stick closer than a brother and he could say I'm not ashamed to be identified with you I'm not ashamed to walk with you but Lord You're Still these things are still being worked out my life I know and the only reason they're worked out because I'm walking with you I'm not ashamed I'm gonna keep walking with you Lord will you lead me to humbling you all the way into surrender but just stay with me let's just keep putting Footsteps in front of footsteps in front but that's the goal yeah but we're going to get there not by jumping not by skipping not by hopping not by Rolling step by step by step by step by step by step by step you throw aside everything and open up the channel Lord I tell you I went by through as I drove through Lorraine over the past few weeks brother Joy I mean I've seen a lot of stuff out on the curves even where I live I said man I mean to tell you I've seen people it just broke my heart coming home from the office there a few weeks ago and I seen these people they must have been well into their 60s I just felt my heart just broke for him their whole driveway was filled up and I knew that all come out of the basement and to think about how that within this right here of God would speak to our lives to throw everything else aside to empty it up oh God help us is that what you want this morning that's what I want everyone else throw aside everything and open up the channel and say this is important and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me not just its return eternally true but it's for me it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I can't fail because I'm taking your word Bears your battle can I go one more point in Exodus 3 . verse four and five God comes here's Moses standing here Moses here just a great example of this Moses has known of the promise of God known of God that here he comes after these 40 years of tending sheep and here he turns aside brother Aaron on a familiar path he's walked before I mean he's walked this path he knows it he don't need GPS he can find his way out of the woods he knows his path this tree that tree all that stone that no he knows it he's walked it but isn't it something how God comes where fat paths that we've walked that are familiar to us but when he comes it becomes more than a familiar moment God wasn't worried about oh I got to put this billboard down here I got to do this I got to put arrows going like this God just moved down in his presence and Moses caught sight of a bush that burned yeah it wasn't consumed it just arose his curiosity but the Curiosity was is that on the inside something was rising up I must turn aside and see this it started with him turning aside and getting off of that path that he had been walking on because that path he had walked a long time and when he got off that path he came up in God's presence and the Lord said put off thy shoes for the place you're standing is Holy Ground this word to put off think of it God never asked him you know how brother Bram will dramatized this God never asked him what do you think you need to put off Moses what do you think well Lord I think I could give this up I mean it's kind of like you know people giving to charity they never give their favorite shirt to charity right or they'll never do this they give things that they no longer want right well you know I'm hitting it we we don't give away the things that we want right we've got the certain kind of donuts that we like we make sure [Laughter] giving away Secrets now I don't do that I said get down flesh oh Jesus put off that shoes from off that feet he didn't ask him Moses what if Moses would have said Lord I'll tell you what I do I'll take off my hat anyone asked but to put off think of what this word put off means this just started early this morning just started striking me to put means to slip off drop off clear away to clear out completely clear entirely well Joshua he had to unloosen them and take them off it wasn't just enough just to unloosen now I know I got slip-ons these are lazy man shoes I'm not lazy I just don't like timeline but these things here and I don't like them when they come untied when I'm preaching so that's why I wear them but he had to unloosen them now let me ask you this question why did God have him take his shoes off brother Bram tells us he said because God could tell him now I got you standing on ground now got you out of your shoes your ways your thinking that's right that's right I got you out of it and I've got you standing on ground right now Moses had been stripped for 40 years and now in the presence of God he realized can't do what God is calling me to do and I know I'm called to do it but I can't do it God said you're right where I want you let me just close with on this that very word to loose the Bible in the book of Acts Brianna if you find that acts chapter 7 it's down there somewhere this same scripture is quoted put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where thou stand is is Holy Grail it was an invitation to Humble himself in the presence of God because God was going to exalt the son of promise the son that which God thought when he spoke that word but God had to get him to where he got out of his shoes got out of his thoughts and this whole word put off right here my this in the Greek it means like things that have been compacted together and so interwoven so tightly you know there's things sometimes I know there's fishermen sitting here some of us that want to be do you know how it is listen your fishing line gets tired tangled up we know how it is you can spend all day out there on the boat trying to get it untangled right or you can just go hammer them pliers snip let it go is that right snip Let It Go let's get another one we'll string this up again I can't untangle it everybody knows what it is it's always that joke about you look like you're trying to untangle fishing line let me just tell you something there ain't nothing not one of us can untangle and could untangle Our Lives all the complexities of things that's been down through there but God this word put off right here in the Greek you see that first beginning up there l-u-o Louisville it's the beginning of the word that we know as Lutron which is washing of water by the word how does God loosen up these things were so intricately tied together in our life but Samuel even after we've been born again oh yeah God's still working on us he's still working on us what's he doing by his word he's washing us by the water of the word to do what he's loosening up it's like if you're dirty what do you do if you're dirty you go get some water why do you get the soap I want to smell good that ain't why you use soap I know
